            To the most honord Sr ROBERT COTTON of Connington. Knight and Baronet.
            
               Noble Sir;
            
            IVstice, no lesse then Obseruance, vrges me to inscribe this Historie of Tithes to your name. So great a part of it, was lent me by your most readie Courtesie and able Direction, that I restore it rather then giue it you. And it cannot but receiue an increase of estimation from your interest thus seen in it. For to haue borowd your help, or vsd that your inestimable Library (which liues in you) assures a curious Diligence in search after the inmost, least known and most vsefull parts of Historicall Truth both of Past and Present Ages. For such is that Truth which your Humanitie liberally dispenses; and such is that which by conference is learned from you. such indeed, as if it were, by your example, more sought after; so much head-long Error, so many ridiculous impostures would not be thrust on the too credulous, by those which stumble on in the Rode, but neuer with any care looke on each side or behind them.

that is, those which keep their Vnderstandings alwaies in a weake Minoritie that euer wants the Autoritie and Admonition of a Tutor. For, as on the one side, it cannot be doubted but that the too studious Affectation of bare and sterile Antiquitie, which is nothing els but to be exceeding busie about nothing, may soon descend to a Dotage; so on the other, the Neglect or only vulgar regard of the fruitfull and precious part of it, which giues necessarie light to the Present in matter of State, Law, Historie, and the vnderstanding of good Autors, is but preferring that kind of Ignorant Infancie, which our short life alone allows vs, before the many ages of former Experience and Obseruation, which may so accumulat yeers to vs as if we had liud euen from the beginning of Time. But you best know this; in whom that vsefull part is so fully eminent, that the most learned through Europe willingly acknowledge it▪ and so open hath your courtesie euer made the plentious store of it to me, that I could not but thus offer you whatsoeuer is in This of mine own also, as a symbole of some thankfulnes. It was at first destind to you. And howeuer through the hastie fortune that (I know not why) it sufferd at the Presse, some pieces of it haue been disperst without the Honor that

your Name might adde to them; I shall be yet euer so ambitious of that Honor, that the whole shall neuer (for so much as I can preuent) be communicated without this prefixt testimonie of Dutie to you. Receiue it fauourably, Noble Sir; and continue to me that Happinesse which I enioy in that you neither repute me vnworthy of your Loue, nor permit me in Ignorance when I come to learne of you.

            THE PREFACE.
            IT hath euen so happend with not a few of the Malicious (what through lazie Ignorance, what through peeuish Ielousie) at their first sight or hearing of the name of this Historie of Tithes, as it was wont with those raw Nouices, that, vpon their first admission to the sacred Mysteries of the Gentiles, troubled and frighted themselues with a world

And doubtlesse, the Priest had not a litle work to perswade them that what they should there meet with, was not an vnluckie Empusa, not a formidable Mormo, not a wanton Cobalus, not a mischieuous Furie, not indeed any thing that their idle brains, being such meer strangers to the abstrusest parts of Truth, had fashiond out. The many fancies that Malice, Ignorance, and Iealousie haue framd to themselues touching this of Mine, haue been no lesse ridiculous; and some equally fearefull, but equally false. And I must here first play the Priest also, and so cleer, if it were possible, those Fancies, by protesting that it is not writen to proue that Tithes are not due by the Law of God; not writen to proue that the Laitie may detaine them, not to proue that Lay hands may still enioy Appropriations; in summe, not at all against the maintenance of the Clergie. Neither is it any thing else but it self, that is, a meer Narration, and the Historie

of Tithes. Nor is the law of God, whence Tithes are commonly deriud, more disputed of in it, then the Diuine Law, whence all Creatures haue their continuing subsistence, is inquired after in Aristotles historie of liuing Creatures, in Plinies Naturall historie, or in Theophrastus his historie of Plants; or then the Iustice of the old Courts of Rome, is examind in Brodaeus his historie of them, or the conuenience of the Ciuill and Canon Laws in that of Riuallius. Nor was any thing, that belonged to the Title, purposely omitted. Nor was any piece of it stolne from any other mans notes. That as the rest also hath been most maliciously imputed by some that so impudently dare coniecture (though they be farre enough from being either—arte aut scientia Diuini) and as iudiciously censure it or me, as those in Lucian, could Euripides, that were weekly stark mad in Rime till Winter, by reason of what they had heard of his Tragedies in Summer, and could neither iudge at all of what they said nor yet possibly hold their peace. But they know there are neuer wanting long eares readie stretcht out to base detraction; and that animates them. I know not how otherwise to confirm these protestations then by sending him, that beleeus me not here, to the view of the whole. He may be there further satisfied. and shall then see also that it is not of the Pitch of the Doctrine of the Breuiarie, or within the compasse of Pocket-learning. Nor will it, I think, looke like what were patcht vp out of Postils, Polyantheas, common

place books or any of the rest of such excellent Instruments for the aduancement of Ignorance and Lazinesse. Nor is any end in it, to teach any Innouation by an imperfit patterne had from the mustie Reliques of former time. Neither is Antiquitie related in it to shew barely what hath been (for the sterile part of Antiquitie which shews that only & to no further purpose, I value euen as slightly as dull Ignorance doth the most precious and vsefull part of it) but to giue other light to the Practice & doubts of the present. Light, that is cleer & necessarie. nor could such as haue searcht in the Subiect see at all often, for want of such Light. But illos non peto, piscem peto. Neither hath it at all wanted the most approuing censures of such as are of choicest Learning, ablest Iudgment, and truly Decumatissimi aswell in worth as Title. Nor is it at all materiall what any one shall cast on it through his secure confidence only, in any of those old 
                  Isidor. P

And none of the Ingenuous and Learned, that read it, wil be backward, I think, to allow it for Truth, as he did that first licenced it for the Presse with Ita est & subscription of his Name.
            But wee leaue this preposterous Admonition in Negatiues (yet by reason of the head-long importunitie of such as haue in great number alreadie misconceiud it, they were necessarie and could not elswhere haue had so fit place) and shortly thus delineat what it is by the end and purpose
               
of writing it; by the Argument of it; by the Course of composing it; and by the summe of performance in it in behalfe of the Clergie.
            
            For the first; we find that in the frequent Disputations about Tithes, not only Arguments out of holy Writ for proofe of a Diuine right to them, but matter also of Fact, that is, Practice and Storie, is very often vsed; as the kinds of paiment of them among the Ebrews, among the Gentiles, the Maintenance of the Church in the Primitiue times, the Arbitrarie Consecrations, Appropriations and Infeodations of them in the midle times, the Payment of them at this day in the seuerall States of Christendom, together with the various Opinions and positiue Laws touching them. For, Opinions and Laws, as they are related only and fall vnder the Question of what and whence they were, are meerly of Fact. And proofs are hence often drawn to confirm sundrie occurrences in inquirie for the truth on either side. That of the Diuine right of them is so wholly a point of Diuinitie and handled so fully by diuers Schoolemen, so imperiously by most of the Canonists, and so confidently by some of our late Diuines, that what euer could be said touching that only, by inference out of the holy Text (which must be the sole triall of it) would but seem taken from some of them which haue so purposely disputed it. Neither were that so fit to be medled with by any as by a profest Diuine. But for that other part which falls vnder Historie, there is not one of them all which hauing boldnes enough

to aduenture on it (which he disputes withall of the diuine right) shews not also too much either Ignorance or Negligence in talking of it, being vsually deceiud and deceiuing in it those most of Readers that giue their Historicall faith captiue to bare Names and common reputation. And as in that old

vs of four Orders exempted, and make the Hospitalers and those of S. Iohns of Ierusalem to be two of them, with other such most grosse and ridiculous absurdities? and it is a common, but most deceiuing argument among them, affirmatiuely to conclude Fact or Practice of Tithing from what they see ordaind for Tithes in any old Canon of the Church. as if euery thing so ordaind, necessarily had also a following vse. it being indeed frequent enough to find Canons directly contrarie to following Practice; and that euen in the proceedings of the Canon Law, which (as the body of it is) was neuer receiued wholly into practice in any State, but hath been euer made subiect in whatsoeuer touches the temporalties or maintenance of the Church (which come from Lay men) to the varietie of the secular Laws of euery State, or to Nationall customes that crosse it.

                and Balsamon, the two chief and ancient Canonists of that part. The Laitie at pleasure commonly limited the Canon Law especially where it toucht their dignities or possessions (and that aswell before Luther so derogated from the autoritie of it by burning it at 
                  Sleiden. Commentar. lib. 2. 
               Witteberg in a publique assembly, in despite of the Pope, as after) which might be manifested by a world of examples. but it is most cleer to all that know Historie. To argue therefore from affirmatiue Canons only to Practice, is equall in not a few things (and especially in this of Tithing) to the prouing of the Practice of a custom from some consonant Law of Plato's common wealth, of Lucians men in the Moon, or of Aristophanes his Citie of Cuckoes in the clouds. To supply therefore the want of a full and faithfull collection of the Historicall part, was the end and purpose why this was composd which might remaine as a furnisht Armorie for such as inquire about this Ecclesiastique Reuenue, and preferring Truth before what dulling custom hath too deeply rooted in them, are not vnwilling to change their old akorns for better meat.
            As touching the Argument of it; the whole being XIV. Chapters, the first VII. are thus filled. the first hath what is, in best autoritie of the ancients, belonging to those Tithes paid before the Leuiticall Law. the second the seuerall kinds paid

by the Iews vnder the Law. and this from Ebrew Lawiers. The third shews the Practice of the Romans, Graecians, and some other Gentiles, in paying or vowing them. Then the whole time of Christianitie being quadripartitly deuided (with allowance of about XX. yeers more or lesse to euery part) takes vp the next Four Chapters, in which the Practice of payment of Tithes, Arbitrarie Consecrations, Appropriations, Infeodations and Exemptions of them, establishment of Parochial right in them, as also the Laws both Secular and Ecclesiastique, with the Opinions of Diuines and Canonists touching them, are in their seuerall times manifested; but so only, that whatsoeuer is proper to this Kingdom of England either in Laws or Practice, either of Payment or of Arbitrarie Consecrations,, Appropriations, or Infeodations, or establishment of Parochiall right, together with a Corollarie of the ancient Iurisdiction whereto they haue been here subiect, is reserud all by it selfe to the next Seuen Chapters. But euery of the XIV haue their Arguments prefixt, which may discharge me of further declaration in this place. By this time, I trust, you conceiue what the name of Historie in the Title pretends. and the Tithes spoken of purposely in it (for perhaps it is needfull to admonish that also) are only such as either haue been paid, vowd, or dedicated to holy vses, or els giue light to the consideration of the performance or omission of such payment. Neither the Decimae Saladinae, nor the Decimae Papales (which were

wont to be imposd) nor the Decima litium in the Imperials, nor the old ratio Decimarum vpon the Lex Pappia, haue had place here, nor the like, which are no more to this subiect then the Tithes paid to the Crown by our Clergie, or by those of the Boroughs by grant in Parlament, or the Terrages in Tenths reserud by Lessors often in France and Spain, or the Tenths anciently paid in some places, as Impost vpon Merchandise, or that old custom of England, in paying the Aurum Reginae, that is a Tenth part of as much mony to De ea re consulas si plura velis, Ioscelinum de Bark

                  9. otherwise then as they occurre in those Acts of Parlament and the Decree vnder Henrie the eight, that mentions the Ministers maintenance by the name of Tithes. For before that Decree, howeuer the LII. farthings paid on Sundaies only were neer the iust Tithe of euery Xs. Rent (that is about 1/9.) and were perhaps thought on by that name (as may be collected out of Lindwood) yet these ioind with the other Offerings of great Festiuall daies, made vp indeed only a certain competencie of maintenance, but could not properly be reputed among Tithes. neither in regard of their Value, nor (as compard with the ancient institution of Tithes among the Iews) in respect of their Nature. For their value came to much more then a Tithe, as also that doth which hath the name of Tithe at this day in London. neither is there reason enough why the LII. farthings that were offerd

on Sundaies should be seuerally, and as deuided from the other Offerings, thought on to this purpose. And for their Nature before these Acts and the Decree; I here offer only what I find in a short discourse, titled, A Deuise how the Curats of London may be prouided of sufficient liuings, writen vnder Henrie the eight, and remaining yet among the Records of the Exchequer. the Autor of it first shews that all Ministers of Gods word should giue freely their labours in the Church, and be maintaind of the Tithe of the free gifts of the earth; as of Cattell, Corne and Fruit; which he supposes is as freely giuen them by the Almightie, through the labour of the people, as the preaching of the Word and administration of Sacraments is to the people through the labour of the Ministers. But he permits not that any mony or other profit, being not liuing gifts, as he calls them, is by the Law of God Titheable. so that where no such liuing gifts and increase are, there no Tithes (as Tithes) are paiable to them, as he concludes. Nor indeed is any mention of other Tithes in the Leuiticall Law, then of the increase of the earth in Fruit and Cattell, that is of the gaine only out of those more naturall Trades (which

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is, the increase of the earth. and in the vulgar it is expressed by fruges. But then, It is to se by what Law Curats of Churches in London can haue (so are the very syllables of that discourse) any liuing of the people otherwise but like as the people by their own consents will giue them for ther Office doing. In very dedde they must haue leuyngs to kepe them out of necessite. and thereby it is to se how in London they cannot receyue ther leuyngs of Godd by no liuely gifts of grace, like as in the Countrey. But in London they must receiue their leuings of mens gifts; that is money which is euery mans own, for their office doing. The Pope by his Law nor by his Bulls cannot compell no man te giffe his own gode to theym for their office doyng more then people will consent to giff theym. for Christ saith that their leuing is freely giuen them of Godd, if they do ther office to see all peple worke. Therefore that if the peple haue not labors and leuings, they ought to haue none nor can make no Law whereby to axe no mans goode. Therfore that leuing which they haue had in London hath been by the consents of the peple which hath long time giuen them xivd. of euery noble rated by the rents of houses which hath been riche leuings: wherewith they not content but ouer that hath procured of the peple money so many weys by casualties of Beryalls, Crystnings, Weddings, Obits, and Offerings, yhe and secretly rifelyth mens consciences taking priuy Tithes of whatsoeuer they can get, be it out of euil goten goodes. howsoeuer

they can get it, they call it ther dewtie. and thence he saies some Benefices were worth Cli. some LXXXli. some C. marks, others Lli. and then he shortly aduises how the Ministers maintenance should be otherwise there limited and leuied. But who sees not enough now that what is called Tithes of houses in London, is rather calld so only then is at all so? yet because the name of Tithes in those Acts of Parlament, is giuen to the Ministers maintenance there, it had been perhaps reputed negligence to haue omitted the remembrance of them, in the course of composing it. The Testimonies were chosen by weight, not by number. taken only thence whither the margin directs, neuer at second hand. Neither affected I to muster vp many petie and late names for proofe of what is had wholly by all from ancient Fountains. The Fountains only and what best cleered them, satisfied me. and I supposd euery iudicious Reader would be so best satisfied also. For in meer matter of elder storie, what credit can Nauclerus, Cario, Cuspinian, or the numerous rest of later time, adde to the testimonies of those Ancients yet extant, from whom they borrowed what euer they haue new drest of preceding ages? Petrus Comestor, or Ludolphus de Saxonia may aswell increase the credit of holy Writ, as those other may the truth of such Histories as instructed them in common with the rest of posteritie. Neither at all wish I that this of mine should gain any strength of Truth from my Name alone, but from those autorities which I haue designed

and brought, both for Elder, Late and Present times, out of such both Printed and Manuscript Annalls, Histories, Councels, Chartularies, Laws, Lawiers, & Records only as were to be vsd in the most accurat way of search that might furnish for the subiect. yet also I haue not neglected the able iudgements of such of the learned of later time, as giue light to former ages. but I so preferd the choisest and most able, that I haue wholly abstaind from any mention or vse here of those many Ignorants that (while they write) rather instruct vs in their own wants of abilitie, then direct to any thing that may satisfie. If through ignorance I haue omitted any thing in the Historie or the Reuiew, that deserued place in them; who euer shall admonish me of it shall haue a most willing acknowledgment of his learning and courtesie▪ But all the bad Titles that are euer due to abuse of the holiest obtestation, be alwaies my companions, if I haue purposely omitted any good autoritie of ancient or late time, that I saw necessarie, or could think might giue further or other light to any Position or part of it! For I sought only Truth; and was neuer so farre ingaged in this or aught els as to torture my brains or venture my credit to make or creat Premisses for a chosen Conclusion, that I rather would then could proue. My Premisses made what Conclusions or Coniectures I haue, and were not bred by them. And although Both of them here not a litle somtimes varie from what is vulgarly receiud; yet that happend not at all from

any desire to differ from common Opinion, but from another course of disquisition then is commonly vsed; that is, by Examination of the truth of those Suppositions which patient Idlenesse too easily takes for cleer & granted. For the old Sceptiques that neuer would professe that they had found a Truth, shewd yet the best way to search for any, when they doubted aswell of what those of the Dogmaticall sects too credulously receiud for infallible Principles, as they did of the newst Conclusions. they were indeed questionlesse too nice, and deceiud themselues with the nimblenesse of their own Sophismes that permitted no kind of established Truth. But plainly, he that auoids their disputing Leuitie, yet, being able, takes to himselfe their Libertie of Inquirie, is in the only way that in all kinds of studies leads and lies open euen to the Sanctuarie of Truth, while others, that are seruile to common Opinion and vulgar suppositions, can rarely hope to be admitted neerer then into the base court of her Temple which too speciously often counterfaits her inmost Sanctuarie. and to this purpose also is that of

            For the Summe of the Performance in behalfe of the Clergie; I dare confidently affirme, that neuer before was there towards so much Humane Law positiue for the paiment of whole Tithes, obserued to publique view as is here discouered; and that especially in the VIII. chapter for the Clergie of England. And plainly he

that talks of Tithes without reference to such positiue Law, makes the obiect of his discourse rather what he would haue should be, then any thing that indeed is at all. For what State is in all Christendom wherein Tithes are paid de facto, otherwise then according to Human Law positiue? that is, as subiect to some Customes, to Statuts, to all ciuill disposition. If they bee in truth due Iure Diuino (which Diuines must determine of) they remain equally so aswel after as before Human Laws made touching them. But that is a question daily controuerted; and among the Clergie. Now, who euer disputes it and relyes only on Ius Diuinum, or the holy Scripture for the right of Tithes, doth but make way for him whom hee cannot perswade that they are due by the Law of God, to thinke that they are no way due. Which questionlesse was the originall cause of the Opinions of such as falsly taught them not at all payable, but arbitrarily as Almes euen since Parochial right in them established. I meane the Dominican and Franciscan Fryers, and those other of a farre different stampe, Wicliffe, Erasmus, and the like. Had they sufficiently thought of the Constitutions and Practice of Christian States, whereby Tithes had been variously dedicated for the maintenance of the Euangelicall Priesthood, and setled for other holy vses either by continuance of time, by the owne

               s conueyance, or by any such other ciuill Title (the strength whereof is immediatly founded in human Law) what colour could they

haue had to thinke that they had been only Almes? for what euer is lawfully established by a ciuill Title, is cleerly debitum Iustitiae, not Charitatis. what brain then except one bewitcht can think that Human positiue Law and common Prac
                  ••
               ce which vsually either declares or makes also a positiue Law, are not most carefully to be sought after in inquiries touching this sacred Reuenue, which is no otherwise enioyed in any State then as that Law hath ordaind and permits. And let Human Laws, Practice, and Opinions bee as their Autors will; yet whatsoeuer argument may be found in the law of God for the right of Tithes, remains still as vntoucht and equally of his former power, as the heat and light of heauen euer did, notwithstanding the vse of Fire had vpon earth. And the truth is that diuers of them that writ, with more will then iudgment, for Tithes, fall often from their Ius Diuinum, before they are aware, and talke of them as supposd due also by Human positiue Law of Practice. But they are farre enough from shewing what or where that Law or Practice is. what doe they else when they confound Tithes and consecrated lands together? and apply that to Tithes which is equally to bee spoken of lands giuen to the Church? I trust they mean not that the Church had an originall Title also Iure Diuino, to lands arbitrarily consecrated to it. Let not then either the purpose or conuenience of th

The learned Frier Bacons most noble Studies being out of the rode of the lazie Clergie of his time, were vehemently at first suspected for such as might preiudice the Church. Reuchlin and Budè, the one for his Ebrew, the other for his Greek, were exceedingly hated because they learned and taught what the Friers and Monkes were meere strangers to. Others about their time had like fortune. Neither was any one thing in the beginning of the Reformation so vnwillingly receiud or more opposd by such as labourd that Ignorance might still continue in her triumph, then that singular light to the cleering of error, the Geek Text of the New Testament, first publisht in print by Erasmus

But there are others that both can iudge and doe wish for all light to Truth. such they were that euen while Ignorāce yet held her declining Empire, defended those Worthies, Bacon, Bude, Reuchlin, Erasmus and the rest that so sufferd. and to doubt whether this of mine shall find such also, were but to question w

But I would their discretions also would designe out to whom it belongs more to write the Historie of Tithes, then to a Common Lawyer.

But should the Ciuilian as a Canonist haue done it? what in all his Decrees, Decretals, and Extrauagants, though hee ioyne many armies of his Doctors, directs him to the Practice of the Iews, Gentiles or Christians? where shall the Canonist or the Ciuilian, or the Diuine, in the courses of their proper studie, find the many Secular Laws made in behalfe of the Clergie for Tithes? where the ancient practice of payment? If it be cleer then (as I hope none hath the impudence to denie it) that neither the Diuine, nor Ciuilian, nor Canonist, by the course of their owne appropried Studies, can come to what is necessary in the knowledge of the History of Tithes, it will bee as cleere that none of them could challenge the medling with it as a right specially belonging to any of their Professions.

strangers to Her that they are all to be reputed of her chiefest Darlings; and some of them are hardly equalled among any other Professors. witnesse in France those euer honord names, Bude, Cuiacius, Brisson, Tiraquell, Pithou, Pasquier, Le Thou, Aerault, Berterie, Sauaron, and others; in the Empire, Gruter, Freher, Ritterhuse; in the vnited Prouinces, Groot, Heuter, and the like elsewhere. For these all were or are practicers of the various common or secular Laws of their own Nations, although they studied the Imperialls and Canons in the Vniuersitie. and who of the learned knows not what light these haue giuen out of their studies of Philologie, both to their own and other Professions? and that in rectifying of Storie, in explication of good Autors, in vindicating from the iniurie of time both what belongs aswell to sacred as prophan studies? why then may not equally a common Lawier of England vse this Philologie? and by consequent be a fit Autor of this Historie of Tithes, as of a proper issue of Philologie? it being indeed much more proper also to Philologie in a common Lawier, then in one of any other Profession.

                     , the Tithe of all he had gotten. Into whose hands he gaue his Tithes, appears not▪ But the chiefest Priest of that time was

his father Isaac. For before Aaron, the Iews say, the Priesthood was wholly annext to the first born of families. Which 
                        Exod. c. 13.1. agrees well with the sanctifying of the first born, commanded in Aegypt. Hence it comes that Melkizedek is commonly reputed to be Sem, the eldest sonne of Noah (for so in this declaration he may be cleerly admitted; although no small controuersie be whether he or Iapheth were the eldest) and Noah, Abraham, and Iob and the like are accounted, 
                        Origen. lib. 1. in Iob.
                      by this right, Priests of that time. and as Abraham, being in a right line X. degrees from Sem, gaue tithes to him being the eldest Ancestor of the house, or first-born, and so a Priest in Salem; so it may be thought, that Iacob paid his vow into the hands of Isaac the chief of the family then liuing as a first-born, and a Priest also. But remember withall, that Iacob, although the yonger Sonne, is reputed also to haue had this Priesthood by the sale made to him of his elder brother Esau's birth-right, to which a Pristhood was incident. So was the ancient opinion of the Iews, as Saint Hierome 
                     
                        In Epist. ad E

                        Gen. c. 32.54. sacrifices, during his fathers life. For, hauing gotten the right of primogeniture, and being long seuered from his fathers house, and hauing a distinct family and posteritie in his own power, notwithstanding his father were then liuing, yet had he that kind

of Priesthood in him. For if this holy right came not to any till he had been the eldest of the family as well as the first born, how could Abraham be accounted for a Priest? as expresly Origen and others reckon him; which the forme of his offring his sonne Isaac also iustifies. He was neuer both first-born and eldest of his family. For Sem liued after him about XL. yeers, and kept that title from him; but a first-born he was, and deuided also from his fathers houshold at the time of his tithes giuen him. whence obserue by the way that both Abraham and Iacob, according to this right of that time, must be Priests also, when they paid these tithes. No other expresse mention is of tithes before Moses his time; vnlesse, with th Iews, you dream, that the Leuiticall Law was writen before the Creation.
               
               
                  III.
                  Let the ancients seeme to haue obserued a respect had to the quantity of what was, as a part of the yeerly increase, consecrated in those times to the Lord; and that euen in the first memorie of sacrifice. Cain's offring was not regarded, they

                        . say, because, quod offerebat non rectè diuidebat, hee did not well deuide what he offerd: which seemes to designe out a defect in the quantity; as if specially some quota pars were at that time required. But this reason was from no other cause then the mistranslation of the text in the Story of Cain. For, where the 
                        Gen 4.7. original is thus, Why is thy Countenance cast downe? if thou doe well, is there not remission? if thou doe ill, sinne lyeth at the door; they read it farre otherwise, and thus; quoniam, nonne, si rectè quidem offeras; non recte

                        quiesce: which is all one with the Septuagints text, that in the Primitiue times was chiefly in vse, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , say they there, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . If thou offer well, but deuidest not well, hast thou not sinned? bee quiet. And this passage of well deuiding, did Iulian, that witty Apostata, take, for a speciall question to oppose a Bishop in his time. But most agreeable to that translation, and not dissonant from the originall, is, that hee gaue with a grudging minde, and

And it is expresly said, that Abel brought of his first fruits, but Cain only of his fruit of the ground; the one giuing the Lord a portion of the best, the other not regarding of what time, what worth it were, so it were of his fruit. So, here is not any quota pars, or certain quantitie noted, but

Those two of the first fruits, and tithes, by this way, are equal. For example. Dispose the letters and their numbers thus.

in the first, out of 400.200. and 20. take 4.2. and 2. that is a vnitie out of euery Centenarie and Decad; and the summe is 8. which, added to the lesse numbers, make 16. Likewise in the second, out of 200. 300.70. and 40. take 2.3.7. and 4. (there being no lesse numbers) and you haue the same summe as in the other, that is 16.

the poore mans Tithe was 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, in stead of the second Tithe. Neither can that in Tobit, touching the payment of the second Tithe euerie yeer (wherein both the Greek and Ebrew of him agree, although in other things they much differ) be otherwise well vnderstood, then for euery of the two yeers, vnlesse that text be wholly contrarie to the known practice of the Iews Canons. So then euerie third yeer the Leuits at the Temple mist their second Tithe for their Feasts and Loue-dayes; the same being charitably, and by diuine Ordinance, spent at home in the gates of the husbandman. Neither doth the second and this poore mans Tithe differ in substance, but only in circumstance. The diuision of both, is exactly the same, and the persons appointed for the eating, are vpon the matter so to. For as the Leuits, ministring in their course at the Temple, were to haue part in the Feasts made of the second, so were the Leuits and the poore in the countrey entertained with this of the third yeere. The place, where the bestowing was, makes their difference; substantially they are the same, and fitly goe vnder one name. which is fully to me confirmed by the Septuagints translation of that place in Deuteronomy, which we 
                        Deut. 26.12. read according to the Ebrew thus: When thou hast made an end of Tithing, all the Tithe of thine encrease in the third yeer (which is the yeer of Tithing) thou shalt giue to the Leuits, strangers, fatherlesse, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled. They there translate it.

Where plainly, you see, the poore mans Tithe is expresly called the second Tithe, which iustifies our Diuision. Doubtlesse, they there in stead of

                     shenith hamaigsher, which they took for the second Tithe, knowing that in truth that place meant no other. Diuers passages in their translations are vpon such differences; and they oftentimes giue thence a kind of commentarie as well as a translation. Neither is it ill context, that shenith of the foeminin gender should be ioind to maigsher of the masculin. it is not without frequent example in holy Writ. That their word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     Athens it self, where by that name, the Tenth of Mulcts and Goods confiscat, was sacred to Minerua. But this place of the yeer of Tithing, is interpreted by the common Glosse 
                        Salomon Iarchi ad dict. loc. Deut.
                      of the Iewes by the yeer of one Tithe, as if the text had been 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, the yeer of one Tithe, or of paying only one Tithe. Which in substance exactly agrees also with the meaning of the Septuagint. For in the third yeere, sayes Iarchi, there was only one Tithe paid of the two commonly spoken of, that is, of the first and second. The first was only paid to the Leuits. The second, by that name, was not: but the

poore mans Tithe in stead of it: and he so expounds it, that hee takes the mention of the Leuits there to designe out the first Tithe of that third yeer paid at Ierusalem, which plainly also confirmes what is here before declared. The second then, and the Tithe of the third yeer are rhe same in substance. The payment of all appeares in this example.

                  After the second Temple destroied, and dispersion of the Iews, their Law of first fruits, Therumahs and Tithes, with them ceased. For their Doctors determin that regularly no inhabitants, but of the land of Israel, were to pay any; although also among them be a wise exception for the lands of Senaar, Moab, Ammon, and Aegypt, because the first is neer their land of Israel, and many Israelites went thither and dwelt there, and the other three are round adioyning their land of Israel. But they deliuer that who so of them took the profits of land mongst the Cutheans or Samaritans, their old enemies (or elswhere in Aram; and so, it seems, by consequent in any other land, sauing which they except) was not to pay any. touching which point many speciall cases are put by

But the great Ioseph Scaliger saies, he askt some of them whether, if they might again build their Temple (as after the captiuitie they

did) their Laws of Sacrifices, first Fruits, & Tithes, would be then reuiud; and their answer was, that to build it again were to no purpose, because they had no lawfull Priesthood, there being not one of them that can proue himselfe a Leuit, though many pretend to be so, and some bear also the office of a kind of Priesthood amongst them. And (for example herein amongst our own Ancestors) when the Iews liued here they had, it seems, one generall or high Priest ouer them, vsually confirmd at least, if not constituted, by the King, for life; as appears by Record, prouing that both Richard the first and King Iohn did by their Patents grant the same. the Copie of it being a most rare example and not from this purpose,

                     which the Lord shall chuse to cause his name to dwell there, (which indeed is only spoken of the second Tithe of the first and second yeers) and ioyning it with the generall commandement of Tithing, and with the precepts of the Passeouer, of the feast of Weeks, and of Tabernacles. in which a certain Place by such an indefinit designment is also mentioned; he addes at length with reference to them all;

But those feasts he speaks of, the Iews, at this day, obserue, although not accuratly according to Moses his Lawes.

                  THe custom of the Gentiles, vsually talkt of in offering a Tenth, is chiefly to be considerd in the Romans and Graecians. The Romans
                     
had a kind of deuotion of giuing Tithes, but neither yeerly, nor by compulsorie Law, as some falsly, but confidently, through ignorance in human literature, deliuer the welthier of them, diuers times vsed to Tithe their estates to Hercules, by spending the Tenth in sacrifices, gifts to his Temples, feasts in his Honor, and the like. it appears so, and to be no otherwise, by

This Recaranus, he saies, first taught them to giue the Tenths of their fruits to Hercules (to whom he consecrated an Altar vnder the name of INVENTORI PATRI, after he had regaind his heards that Cacus had stolne) rather then to the King as before the vse was; and then he addes, inde videlicet tractum vt Herculi Decimam profanari mos esset; that is, thence came it to be a custom, that diuers did pay him a tithe. But, neither by their Law Ciuill or Pontificiall, was this payment. Often it was as a thanksgiuing after some increase of fortune, and often by vow beforehand, and for the most part, of increase of estate by mony gotten vpon sales, and of spoiles of warre. For such things that made accessions to their estates, they were sometime so thankfull. Whereat Cicero iesting, saies, that neuer

any man vowd Hercules a Tenth, in hope of increase of his wit. Neque

At other times also, on the generall worship of the gods, such a Tithe was spent. And other Deities, besides any

of these, had somtimes Tenths of gaine; as Fortune, Mercurie, being the gods of Trauellers and Tradesmen; and the Deities of the way, or Dij Semitales; as Vius, and others. so Noble Scaliger vnderstands that which Taurinus speaks of his father Caesius a Merchant, in an inscription

Thus in Italie the custom was arbitrarily to pay and vow Tithes to their Deities, and continued in vse til the later times of the Empire, as appears also in that Law receiud from Vlpian by

                  The view of these examples plainly disproues that assertion vsed by many out of Festus: Decima quaeque veteres Dijs suis offerebant. no such matter. some did, and only somtimes, and of some things, and most vsually to some gods only. Festus himselfe

was too learned to haue left such a moniment of ignorance. No doubt is, but that which Festus had there in some larger note obserued, according to a truth agreeing with what is before opend, was too boldly contracted into that piece of vntruth, by his Epitomator Paulus Diaconas. as in him, so in many other, most obseruable things haue perished, both by the ignorance aswell as negligence of insufficient Epitomators. and Paulus is well taxed for it by the diuine Scaliger.

But when Scaliger there addes; Vni enim tantum Herculi hoc fiebat; he mends it not enough. for if it had been Decima quaeque. Herculi veteres offerebant, it had been false, if vnderstood as of Tithes vsed to be giuen by all or of all things. they consisted painly in vows and speciall thanksgiuing, which were wholly arbitrarie, as Tenths or Fifteenths giuen by the Subiect in Parlament. and had the offering of them been vsuall of yeerly increase, Cato, that in his de Re Rustica hath so fully the ceremonies of Sacrifices to be vsed by the husbandman in his Haruest, had neuer omitted it.

                  These examples among the Graecians are, for some kind of Tithes vowd, or otherwise arbitrarily, or by some locall custom paid to speciall Deities. But testimonies are not wanting among them,

                     , to Tithe, signifies also to consecrat. but therein they are deceiud.

But if those Grammarians meant that al men paid their Tithes in Greece, and that of euery kind of their spoiles or abundance; they deceiue much and are deceiud. you must vnderstand them as speaking of what was sometimes, and by vow or speciall thanksgiuing, done. Their saying it was a Custome to tithe, or that they tithed, is but like that of Cassius: mos erat Herculi decimam profanari among the Romans. It was a custome somtime and of somthings

to doe it, as it was a custome to consecrat statues, haire, vessels, and other more such like to Deities. yet were those customes no more generall or binding all or done by all, then the custome, in some Cities among vs, to offer at wedding-dayes. it was a custome or vse to doe so; that is, many men did so. The examples before taken out of story make that plaine. And in that sense only are these autors to be credited, touching the consecrating of Tithes to the gods in generall. For sometimes they were generally giuen to the gods, without any particular designed. Suidas

Neither is it vnlikely but that the ancient and most known examples of Abraham, gaue the first ground, both to them and to the Europaeans, so somtimes to dispose the Tenth of their spoiles of warre to holy vses. For 'tis no newes to haue the eldest of Iewish customs vsurpt (though according to time and place diuersly varied) amongst the Gentiles.

                  SInce our Sauiour, the time being about MDC. yeers, it will fall aptly enough so to diuide that number quadripartitly, that we may discouer the known Vse, Opinion, and Constitutions of euery foure hundred yeers, touching the dutie or paiment of Tenths. the difference or latitude of XX. yeers or some such number, either of increase or want (as accasion shall serue) being allowd. and the English Law and Vse (because therein we shall be most particular) being referd to the last seuen Chapters. Till towards the end of the first foure hundred, no Paiment of them can be proued to haue been in vse. Some Opinion is of their being due. and Constitutions also; but such, as are of no credit. For the first; 'tis best declared by shewing the course of the Church-maintenance in that time.

So liberall, in the beginning gf Christianity, was the deuotion of the beleeuers, that their bountie, to the Euangelicall Priesthood, farre exceeded what the Tenth could haue been. For if you looke to the first of the Apostles times; then the vnitie

Vt qui (as he

that of the Leuits, as being proportionable. But hence also 'tis manifest, that no payment of Tithes was in S. Cyprians time in vse, although some, too rashly, from this very place would inferre so much. those words tanquam Decimas accipientes (which continues the comparing of Ministers of the Gospel with the Leuits) plainly exclude them. And elsewhere also the same Father finding fault with a coldnes of deuotion that then possest many, in regard of what was in vse in the Apostles times, and seeing that the Oblations giuen were lesse then vsually before, expresses

Neither for ought appears in old moniments of credit, till neer the end of this first four hundred yeers, was any paiment to the Church of any tenth part, as a Tenth, at all in vse.

                           er. cap. 18. vpon the Text of first-Fruits in the Law, wherin while he teaches that some things are literally to be obserud, he well admonisheth that 'tis the part of a wise Interpreter to find out which are so, and which not. And then first he deliuers his iudgement, that this of first-Fruits is one to be obserud still according to the letter, and giues this reason; Decet enim (as the Latin is: the Greek I neither haue, nor could euer learn that it hath been publisht) & vtile est etiam Sacerdotibus Euangelij offerri primitias. Ita enim & Dominus disposuit, vt qui Euangelium annuntiant de Euangelio viuant, & qui Altari deseruiunt de Altari participent;

and a litle after addes also for Tithes: Et adhuc vt amplius haec obseruanda etiam secundùm literam ipsius Dei vocibus doceamur, addemus ad haec; Dominus dicit in Euangelijs; Vae vobis Scribae & Pharisaei, hypocritae, qui decimatis mentam, hoc est, Decimam datis mentae & cymini & anethi & praeteritis quae maiora sunt legis. hypocritae, haec oportet fieri & illa non omitti. Vide ergo diligentius quomodo sermo Domini vult fieri quidem omnimode quae maiora sunt legis. non tamen omitti & haec quae secundum literam designantur. Quod si dicas, quod haec ad Pharisaeos dicebat non ad Discipulos; audi iterum ipsum dicentem ad Discipulos: Nisi abundauerit iustitia vestra plusquam Pharisaeorum & Scribarum, non intrabitis in regnum Coelorum. Quod ergo vult fieri à Pharisaeis multo magis & maiore cum abundantia vult à Discipulis impleri. And a litle after. Quomodo ergo abundat iustitia nostra plusquam Scribarum & Pharisaeorum, si illi de fructibus terrae suae gustare non audent priusquam primitias Sacerdotibus offerant & Leuitis Decimae separentur; & ego nihil horum faciens fructibus terrae ita abutar, vt Sacerdos nesciat, Leuites ignoret, diuinum Altare non sentiat. And in this forme, and vpon these reasons, he brings in that of Tenths in the Gospell, to proue his purpose of first-Fruits. But in his conclusion vpon it, he leaues out Tenths, and speaks only of first-Fruits, thus. Haec diximus asserentes mandatum de primitijs frugum vel pecorum debere etiam secundum literam stare. What we haue transcribed shews both his opinion fully, and the ground of it; without which specially obserued,

error soon followes ofttimes in collection from autoritie. For Opinion of this time, thus much. More, I confesse, might be added out of some other great Fathers, as S. Ambrose, and S. Augustine. but because they fall so neer the end of our first age and continue into the second; they are omitted here and referd to the beginning of the next foure hunderd yeers.

Had it been the Apostles ordinance or the vse of the Church in the

Primitiue times, Origen, Tertullian and Cyprian (hauing such occasion to mention it) could not haue been so silent of it. And is it likely that all the old Councels, from thence till neer DC. yeeres after Christ (which, being authentique beyond exception, haue speciall Canons for the lands and goods possest by the Church, the Offerings, Reuenues, and such more) could haue omitted the name of Tenths, if either such vse or Apostolicall Law had preceded?

Neither before Binius his edition had any Volume of the Councels receiud into them a memorie of any such Decrees vnder this Damasus, or any Councell of his of that number. Those kind of Acts and Legends of Popes and others, are indeed vsually stufft with such falshoods, as being bred in the midle ages among idle Monks, not only grow ancient now, but are receiud amongst vs with such reuerence, that the antiquitie which the Copies haue gaind out of later time, is mistook for a Character of truth in them for the times to which they were first, by fiction or bold interpolation, referd. In summe, no example for the Synods of succeeding ages, no antiquitie for the Compilers of the Canons, had been of equall reuerence to this of a Pope, and done at Rome. neither had they omitted euery of those Decrees, had they been truly his. Confidently

conclude, they are supposititious. yet remember too that some colour is for the truth of such a Constitution, in regard that about that time the first memorie is of Tithes by that name paid in the primitiue Church; as in the next part of this diuision shall be declared. And were that

                      Epistle not counterfait, which is attributed to S. Hierom, as writen to this Pope vpon that question: Vtrum vs as decimarum & oblationum secularibus peruenire possit, it might be good cause to maintain the truth of this Decree of his for Tithes.

                     I. Tithes were now paid in diuers places, to Abbots, to the Poore, to the Clergie.

                     III. That storie of Charles Martell his taking away Tithes, and making them feodall, cannot be iustified.

                     VI. No Canon or other Law was yet generally receiud to compell any payment of Tithes, although among the Offerings of deuout Christians, gifts of that quantitie, were receiued as due by the Doctrine then in vse, in some places only.
               
               ABout the beginning of the next, or rather some yeers before the end of the first part of this diuision, and afterward, Tenths were paid, or, for holy vses offerd (as the phrase was) in diuers places, in Offerings of that quantitie; and some testimonie is of Churches also endowd with the perpetuall right of them in the later halfe of this four hundred yeers. Great Opinion was now of their being due. And some Canons and Prouinciall Constitutions, attributed to this time, ordain a payment of them. But not aboue one of these (and that's only Prouinciall) is of any credit.

                  That they were offerd vnder the name of Tenths in part of Italie, may be collected out of S. Ambrose who was Bishop of Millan before, and after the yeer CCC.XC. And the like for the Diocesse of Hippo may be supposd out of S. Augustines vehement Sermon for the payment of them. The words of both these Fathers (which in relating their opinions are anon transcribed) may enough proue, that some did in those times offer them. And it may be,

                  If the common tale of Charles Martell his

taking away the Tithes, that Churches were endowd with, and giuing them to the Laitie, about the yeer DCC.XL. were true, it were autoritie (both for generall payment, and speciall endowment in those times) of great antiquitie and faire proof. but although that of him be receiud as a storie by diuers of late time, yet cleerly it can neuer be iustified. He was indeed a robber of the Church; but he is not mentioned by any old autor of credit, to haue medled with Tithes. He was Monasteriorum multorum Euersor, and Ecclesiasticarum pecuniarum in vsus proprios commutator, as

That's enough, & truth too, that Boniface brands him withall for his tyrannical spoiling the Church of her other possessions; Longa torsione & verenda morte consumtus est. the rest is only out of the Legend of Eucherius his life, which (as other things for the most part of that kind) is too full of falshoods to gain to it selfe any credit. And some late Canonists that out of his tyrannie against the Church, interpret their Decimae infeudatae, or feudall Tithes, are alike in no small error, as in the next Age shall be manifested.

                      S. Ambrose thus, in a sermon of Repentance, teaches them due by Gods Law. Non nobis sufficit (saies he) quod nomen Christianorum praeferamus, si opera Christiana non facimus. Decimas nostras annis singulis de cunctis frugibus, pecoribus &c. praecipit erogandas Dominus.
                     
Then he 
                        •
                     ltes the Text of that Precept, out of Moses, and goes on with Nouem partes vobis tributae sunt, sed qui Decimas dare noluistis ad solam Decimam reuertotis. Next, hee reprehends other offences, and addes, Quicunque recognoscit in se quod fideliter non dederit Decimas suas, modo omendet, quod minus fecit quid est, fideliter Decimas dare, nisi vt nec peius, nec minus aliquando Deo offeras, aut de grano tuo, aut de vino, aut de fructibus arborum, aut de pecoribus, aut de harto, aut de negotijs, aut de venatione sua. De omni substantia quam Deus homini donat, Decimam partem sibi reseruauit, & ideo non licet homini retinere illud quod Deus sibi reseruauit. Agreeing with him, is S. Augustine in a whole Homily

Propitio Christo, saith he, fratres charissimi, iam propè sunt dies in quibus messes colligere debeamus, & ideo gratias agentes Deo qui dedit, de offerendis, imò reddendis Decimis cogitemus. Deus enim qui dignatus est totum dare, Decimam à nobis dignatur repetere, non sibi, sed nobis sine dubio profuturam. and grounds himself vpon that of

                     Malachy, the text of honor the Lord thy God with all thy substance, and the like. Then exhorts them. Decimae tributa sunt egentium animarum. redde ergo tributa pauperibus; offer libamina sacerdotibus; and admonishes, that, if they haue no fruits of the earth, they should pay the Tithe of whatsoeuer they liue by; Quodcunque te pascit

And then vrging more Texts out of the old Testament touching Tithes and first fruits, and telling them, that the neglect of payment is the cause of sterilitie and blasting; Haec est (he saith) Domini iustissima consuetudo, vt si tu illi Decimam non dederis, tu ad Decimam reuoceris. And afterward with much earnestnesse, Decimae ex debito requiruntur, & qui eas dare noluerit, res alienas inuasit. & quanti pauperes in locis vbi ipse habitat, illo

Qmi ergo sibi aut praemium comparare, aut peccatorum desiderat indulgentiam promereri, reddat Decimam. These two great Bishops agree; and from the Law giuen to the Israelites, take their whole doctrine. S. Hierome is by some vsed for an autor to the same purpose, and that from his

Who hence thinks, that his opinion agrees with the other two, may as well inferre, that he meant also, that all men were still bound to sell all they had, as in the Apostles times. Hee speakes only, as admonishing Christians to giue their almes to the poore, and double

Here is no small testimonie aswell of ancient Practice in paying of them, as of great Opinion for their being due. But although the whole Councell hath to this day remaind with the subscriptions of the Bishops to it, yet (whateuer the cause was) not so much as any Canon of it is found mentioned, as of receiud authoritie in any of the more ancient Compilers of Synodall decrees; notwithstanding, that the fullest of them, I meane Isidore, liud long after this Councell held, and hath some other Synods of the Continent of France, as of Orleans, of Arles, of Agatha.

                     Iuo, an expresse Canon for the payment of first Fruits and Tenths, to the Prouinciall Synod of Siuill, held in the yeer D.CX. in these words. Omnes primitias & Decimas tam de pecoribus quàm de frugibus, diues simul & pauper Ecclesijs suis rectè offerant. and a litle after: Omnis rusticus & artifex quis

The Councell of that yeer and place is extant, whole in diuers editions, as it was certified by eight Bishops which were at it; and in that no taste is of any such matter. The old Ms. copie of Iuo, of or very neer his time, in the Librarie of Pauls, hath it ex Concilio Spanensi, the printed book being ex Concilio Hispalensi; what Spanensi is, I know not. if it were Spalensi, it were the same with Hispalensi, for which Spalensi is alwaies in Isidores Councels, as Spania is somtimes

Some others like these occurring are mistaken. and you may obserue that Gratian more warily abstaind from vsing such Canons mistitled; among which also, from these. But the lesse falshood is to be imputed to Iuo, in regard that Burchard before him had almost all his syllables; from whom hee transcribed. yet that excuses not his negligence committed in not carefully examining his autor; which often causes grosse impostures, sometimes proceeding from malice, somtimes from ignorance, to be receiued as perfit truth; especially by those that cite, without more regard, Prouinciall Synods absolutly there mentioned for the first of that name, when indeed they are often of farre later time. Slothful Readers are soon so deceiued. But among the known and cerain moniments of truth, till about the end of this CCCC. yeers, no Law Pontificall, or Synodall (saning that of Mascon) determins, or commands any thing concerning Tents; although very many are which speaking purposely and larely of Church Reuenues, Oblations, and such like, could not haue been silent of them, if that quantitie had been then establisht for

a certain dutie· You may see

                        Burchard lib. 3. cap 135. & Iuo part. 3. cap. 201. in an old Councell of Cologne. hee that reads those old Canons only, as they are so applied, in late autoritie, to Tithes, might perhaps soone think that at first they were made specially and by name for them. The matter is plainly otherwise. what was ordaind in them about Oblations, is out of them in later times (Tithes and Oblations being then supposed of equall right) expresly extended also to Tithes. the word Oblations, as you see in those times, being vsuall for Tithes also when they were giuen; and offerre Decimas was the common phrase, for to giue Tithes. About the end of these yeers in a Prouincial Synod held at Friuli
                     
in D.CC.XCI. vnder Paulinus Patriarch of Aquilegia, the words are, De Decimis verò vel primitijs (saluis scilicet allegoricarum rerum mysticis Sacramentis) nihil meliùs puto dicere quàm quod scriptum est in Malachia Propheta, dicente Domino; inferte omnem Decimam in horreum meum &c. and vpon that place, the supposition of the dutie being grounded, a Commination is added; Quis non timeat vel contremiscat illam maledictionem quam minatur nolentibus offerre? The opinion of the Synod is here plainly seen. and it is rather a declaration by Doctrine, then a constitution by Precept.
               
               
                  VI.
                  But howeuer either this of Friuli, or that before cited of Mascon, had their Prouinciall authoritie, no Canon as yet was receiued in the Church generally, as a binding Law, for payment of any certain quantitie; which not only appears in that we find none such now remaining, but also is confirmd by the testimonie of a great and learned French Bishop (in whose Prouince also Mascon was) that could not be ignorant of the receiud Law of his time. Hee liud and wrote very neere the end of this first foure hundred yeers (I thinke, in the very beginning of the next.) And, in a Treatise about the dispensation of Church reuenues, expresly denies, that before his time any Synod or generall doctrine of the Church had determind or ordaind any thing touching the quantitie that should be giuen, either for maintenance or building of Churches. Because his words are speciall

autoritie also against those counterfeit titles of Canons before spoken of, they shall haue place here. Iam verò (saith

This Autor is Agobard Bishop of Lions (very learned, and of great iudgement) and had not so confidently denied what you see hee doth, if any Decree, Canon, or Councell generally receiud, had before his time commanded the payment or offering of any certain part. How the autoritie of that Councell of Mascon stands with his meaning, I well conceiue not. But cleerly, hee speaks truth, in regard of what was generally receiud. For neither in the Codex Ecclesiae vniuersalis, or the Codex Ecclesiae Romanae, or Africanae, Fulgentius Ferrandus, Cresconius, or Isidores collection (all which, in those elder ages, were as parts of the body of the Canon Law) is once any mention of the name of Tenths.

These also shew a vse of payment among the firmer and deuouter Christians in those times. But they were then disposed of diuersly; now you see to the Priests, now to Abbots, now to the Poor. and when they were offered to Baptismall or Episcopall Churches, they were receiud as indefinit Offerings, the quantitie whereof was wholly arbitrarie, in respect of any constitution or generall Law in vse. The quantitie of the Offerings was arbitrarie, but some kind of Offering was necessarie. He that offered not at all, of his fruits, was compellable, it seems, by Excommunication (as in the

But because they fall so neere the end of this part of our Diuision, and are rather to be accounted amongst the Laws of his Empire (which began not till neer XX. yeers after; that is, about D.CCC.) then only of his Kingdome, and were afterward receiud into the Imperiall Capitularies, whence we haue chiefest notice of them; they are purposely referd into the next CCCC. yeeres, as the first Latitude, required in our Diuision, permits. Neither before them, did any generall Law, that yet remains in publique, and is of credit, ordain any payment of Tenths in the Westerne Church. For in the Eastern, neuer any Law, that I haue obserud, mentions them.

               THe practice found in the time twixt about D.CCC. and M.CC. from Christ, consists in some ordinarie payments of Tithes, as in the former ages; in more frequent Consecrations
                  
of a perpetuall right of them alone to any Church, or Monasterie, at the owners choice; in Appropriations of them with the churches in which they were by custom or consecration established; in Infeodations of them into Lay-hands; and in Exemptions for discharge of paiment. By the more generall Opinion of the Church, they are exprest to be due Iure diuino; but that is warily to be interpreted out of the generall practice cleerly allowd by the Clergie. From the beginning of this time Canons are very frequent for the right of them. But the first Law that may at all be stiled generall for it, was ordaind by Charles the Great, and receiud, but litle practiced, through the Empire. Of all these in their order.
               
                  I.
                  Not only from deuotion, but through Ecclesiastique censure also, aided with secular power, about the very beginning of this CCCC. yeers, many Churches in the Western Empire, had the Tenth paid as a dutie. This may be collected out of an Epistle writen by Alchwin to Charles the Great, touching the exaction of Tithes (which hee calls iugum Decimarum and plena per singulas domus exactio) of the Hunnes and Saxons; who being then lately, by Charles, conquerd, had newly receiued the Christian faith, Alchwin there aduises, that it were better for the Christian cause, to omit it amongst them, till they were grown firmer, and speaks of it as a thing of known vse among other setled Christans. His words are: Vestra sanctissima pietas sapienti consilio praeuideat, si melius sit rudibus

populis in principio fidei iugum imponere Decimarum, vt plena fiat per singulas domus exactio illarum. an Apostoli quoque ab ipso Deo Christo edocti & ad predicandum mundo missi, exactiones Decimarum exegissent, vel alicui demandassent dari, considerandum est. Scimus quia Decimatio substantiae nostrae valde bona est. Sed melius est illam amittere quàm fidem perdere. Nos vero in fide Catholica nati, nutriti, & edocti, vix consentimus substantiam nostram plenitèr Decimari? Quanto magis tenera fides, & infantilis animus, & auara mens illarum largitati non consentit? This Epistle was writen about DCC.XCVII. as the historicall part of it perswades. and the generall Laws, by which that exaction might haue been made, are among those which about DCC.LXXX. the tame Charles had ordaind in an assembly of Estates, of which more in the last Paragraph of this Chapter. But the execution of those Laws soone afterward (as anon shall be declared) failing; this practice of paiment also became to be of rare vse. and although diuers Synods soon followd which commanded a Tenth, as what was due of it selfe to the Church (whence also in some places a Parochial paiment doubtlesse continued, and by prescription and custom established a ciuill right in some Churches) yet Aliter Ecclesiastici. quod vid

setled, and therein pretended them due only but as their own choice, either by Consecration to any Church or Monasterie whatsoeuer, or by Infeodation into Lay-hands, should determin. And those also which were established by former Consecration, Custom, or Prescription, were very often arbitrarily disposed of also by Lay-Patrons in their Appropriations.

threescore yeers, yet the Bishop began to denie any more paiment, and for his owne gaine, would haue maintaind this opinion, That no church-lands were to pay Tithes to any Church. But Godfrey Abbot of Vendosme about the yeer M.C.XX. sharply corrects him in an Epistle▪ and shews that the opinion of all France and Italie, then was, that although lands charged to any Church with the paiment of Tithes, were possessed by another Church or Monasterie, yet the Tithes were still paiable Parochially from the one Church to the other.

But as great a fault as it was, it was a common one; and being committed by the Laitie was vsually allowd in fact by the Pope and the Ordinaries; whateuer they thought of it in right. And of such autoritie was this vse, that an opinion was bred from it among very great men of the Clergie, that, as arbitrarie Consecration was a cause of the right of Tithes in a Church whereto they were conueid, so continuall paiment of many yeers (which being by diuers, of the more deuout, faithfully performed, those Clergie men tooke as equiualent to a personall consecration of

the Tenths of their increase, whereuer it were receiud) had so setled the perpetuall right of the Tithes of any Familie, that whither soeuer it transplanted it selfe, it must still send its Tenths to the place where before it paid them; as if this continuall paiment had foreuer so bound it, that it might not pay them otherwise.

                  In declaration of the course of Appropriations, it is first necessarie, to know so much of the nature of Parish Churches in those times, as without which the Appropriations then vsed cannot be vnderstood. Briefly therefore, for Parish Churches; it is plain that as Metropolitique Sees, Patriarchats (Exarchats also in the Eastern Church) and Bishopriques: those greater dignities, were most vsually at first ordaind and limited Videsis Anacl

And in the first ordination of this Hierarchie of Bishops and Parochiall Priests, it seemes, in some Lands wherewith the Bishoprique was endowed, the Churches were erected, in which the Bishop had a kind of right of aduowson; who, taking on him the generall care of his Diocese, ordained Incumbents in euery of them. and the oblations there receiud were of the Churches common treasure, and so to be diuided and disposed of quadripartitly. But that quadripartit diuision was chiefly in the Diocese of Rome. For by some

But not long after such time as lay men began to build and endow Parish-Oratories or Churches

in their Lordships, and in them place or inuest Chaplaines (ordaind, that is, made Priests by the Bishop, but not instituted by Presentation as at this day) that might receiue the offerings of such as repayred thither for holy seruice; that former kind, of making a common treasurie in euery Diocese, was discontinued, and the Chaplaine or Incumbent, acknowledging the Lord, of his Churches Territory, for Patron, (not much otherwise then, as in the ancienter course, euery Parochiall Priest did the Bishop that collated to him) receiued now the profits that rose out of Christian deuotion, to a particular vse of his owne Church; the Canons neuerthelesse sauing the fourth part to the Bishop.

                      that the founder should be vtterly excluded from all interest) yet diuers lay-Patrons in those elder times had, or at least challenged, in the Oblations receiud from Christian

deuotion in their Churches, an interest somewhat like to what more anciently the Bishop had in the offerings made at the Churches wherein hee only placed the Ministers. Whence the erecting of Churches became, amongst some, to bee rather gainfull then deuout. for the Patron would arbitrarily diuide to the Incumbent, and take the rest to his own vse. This is manifested in the II. Councell of Bracara, held about D.LXX. where a Canon forbids the consecration of Churches built not pro sanctorum patrocinio, but sub tributaria conditione, as the vse was of some places; that is, to the end that the lay-founder might haue halfe or other part of the Oblations. Si quis, are the words, Basilicam non pro deuotione fidei sed pro quaestu cupiditatis aedificat, vt quicquid ibi de oblatione populi colligitur, medium cum Clericis diuidat, eo quod Basilicam in terra sua quaestus causa condiderit, quod in aliquibus locis vsque modo dicitur fieri, Hoc ergo de caetero, &c. And such a practice is titled a custom of the ancient times in an Epistle 1. C. 10. q. 1. c. 15 attributed to to Pope Damasus. And in the IX. Councell of Toledo about the yeer DC.LX. Lay-Patrons are forbidden to vse iuris proprij potestatem in Church goods or lands, as if great pretence in those times had been of their right in disposition of them. and, in the Imperiall Capitularies of about the yeer DCCC. diuers times prouision is made against such lay men as thought it had been their right only to dispose of the endowments and offerings

of such Churches as they were Patrons of, and that the Bishop should bee wholly excluded. But it fell at length that, without much difficulty, the Church, what through Constitutions, what through Constitutions, what by their Doctrine, had remedy for this vsurpation vpon the Offrings solemnly consecrated to the Priests at the Altar. And in the following times it had been abstaind from as the playnest part of sacriledge. Yet neuerthelesse, another interest, that is, the interest of Patronage, and a right of disposition of the Temporall endowments, which the Lay founders first challenged in their new erected Churches, which was a right of Collation or Inuestiture, whereby the Incumbent might receiue full possession without ayd of Bishop or other Church-man, could not so easily be gotten from them, although some

                        Cicero in Orat. pre domo sua.
                      one of the Priests solemnly holding a Pillar of it in his hand, should make the dedication) yet it being consecrated and endowed, the lay Patron, in these ancient times, tooke vpon him not only the Aduocationem, or aduowson (that is, the defence or patrocinie of the Incumbents title; as officium aduocationis is vsed in the 
                        Vlpian. ff de rei vindicatione L. 540. Imperials) but also the Collation by Inuestiture without presentation at

euery vacancy. And the right of aduowson (wherto the other of Inuestiture in those times was annext) in some places the Bishop confirmed to him by putting a Robe or such like on him at the dedication. as the example

And hence was the name of Benefice, for a Church and endowments so giuen. For as such lands or annuities, as in the Empire, were giuen for perpetuall salaries to military persons, had the name of Beneficia, so, what was thus conferd vpon spirituall souldiers in the Church, had afterward the like title. But, at this Commendation of the temporalties so made only by the Patron, the Bishop indeed had the vsuall consecration of the Incumbent, but nothing at all to do with the dispositiō of the church or endowments.

And, notwithstanding those Decrees, both Oecumenicall and Pontificiall, that practice of Inuestitures could not presently be taken from the Laitie, although soon after that generall Councell held vnder Innocent the second, in M.C.XXXIX. it began to be lesse frequent, and Institution vpon Presentation

Besides other occurrences of Inuestitures in Epistles, Councels, and Storie of about M.C. you may see especially the Epistle twixt Iuo Bishop of Chartres, and Iohn Archbishop of Lions, with others of Godfrey Abbot of Vendosme (all written about M.C.XXX.) in which it is largely disputed of; and in them it appears plainly, that although the Church would neuer haue permitted it to the Laitie, and did also sometimes extort renuntiations of it, yet the Pope often regranted the right of it in France and Germanie to such as had renounced it. Whence also Iuo concluded, that it was but a ciuill right belonging (by their Canons) to the Church, and no such thing, as of its owne nature, could not be enioyd by the Laitie. But the Canons gaining force, as the Papall power encreased, at length, about the end of this CCCC. yeers, it became wholly out of vse. for not till then was it left off; and that the course of Institutions vpon Presentations was not before commonly practiced (especially in the case of lay Patrons) appears by diuers

By reason of these Inuestitures (wherein the Glebe, Tithes, and all Endowments of the Church, as well as the Church it selfe, in point of interest or estate, passed from the Patron, and at euery vacancie were in him as in the only proprietarie of them) when Appropriations in these ancient times were made, it was not only the Church it selfe, or the Titulus Ecclesiae (for that also, once by consecration created, was giuen by lay Patrons, when the Clerk had already his Orders) or the patronage, that was directly in point of interest conueyed, but withall the Glebe and Tithe made parochiall by Grant, Foundation, or Custome. And the title of the Church, the Monasterie (according to the Patrons prouision in many Appropriations; and in others, at their pleasure) still gaue afterward by Presentation of a Clerk, whom the Bishop instituted. For the Clergie, except Bishops and such as had Episcopall right by priuiledge, gaue Ad hanc rem, vide c. 16. q. 2.1. & 6. vsually by Presentations; these Inuestitures being altogether against their Canons, and but like the Bishops Collations. Neither did any such thing follow vpon such Presentation as Disappropriation, in regard of the Endowments or Temporalties. for such was the nature of the Appropriations, that the Church remaind notwithstanding presentatiue. and the Incumbent, that came in by presentation, had the Church only

vnder the name of Vicar, and in anothers right, and receiued the Tithes and the profit of the Glebe, no otherwise then to the vse of the Monasterie, in which the Appropriation had setled them, as Inuestiture should haue done in an Incumbent. Neither was the Title of the Church, and the Endowments, so entire a thing, but that, according to the Patrons interest and will, they might by the Law then in practice be so seuerd. The ordinarie instruments of such Appropriations plainly shew it. And all the maintenance of the Incumbent was at the bountie of the Monasteries allowance. And it is exprest vsually in old Instruments of Appropriations, that such a Clerk should answer to the Bishop de spiritualibus, vobis autem (to the Monasterie) de temporalibus.

The words of conueyance in Appropriating commonly were, Dedi & confirmaui Ecclesiam de N. cum decimis, or cum Decimatione, &c. Whereby the Church Glebe and Tithes passed equally, by way of interest, to the Monasterie. So anciently, and at this day, manie Couents, but especially the Praemonstratenses, haue diuers Churches continually in their owne hands. And some of the Monks receiud

If you question how the Bishop came to haue power to make these Grants, eyther in regard of Parochiall Curats by the Canon Law, or of the Lay owners interest, according to the practice of the Time; know, that in this and most of the Bishoprique of Germanie especially (which began with the Christianitie of the Dioceses,

about, or since the beginning of the French Empire) the right of Tithes, through those Dioceses, was challenged by the Bishops onely (and that iustly enough by the Lawes of the Empire, which presently are related) because the Parishes being not limited, nor indeed Christianitie so at first setled, that they could haue beene well assigned to Parochiall Curats, the Bishops were the true and immediat Parochiall and ministring Rectors in their Bishop

Neither had it beene altogether safe among so obstinate a people (which could scarce by any means be brought to pay any Tenths) to haue permitted euery Parish Rector afterward to haue demanded them, or taught them due to himselfe. for to such as had both at once receiued the Doctrine of the Faith, and the declaration of the right of Tithes due to the Ministers (which were only, when they receiued it, the Bishops; if you respect only, as you must, the Ministers setled among them) it might haue seemd a different Doctrine, to haue afterward taught them due to any inferior part of the

Hierarchie; especially in the weaker yeeres of that Church. Hence is it, that the Archbishop of

                     Saltzburg, and others, the Tithes of their Dioceses. and hence only those of Hamborough so liberally dispose of them. Neither could any of these reasons so well haue place in other Countries. for (except in Germanie, and those more Northerne parts) Christianitie was in most places of Europe, it seems, so established, and the Hierarchie of Bishops and parochiall Rectors so setled, before any common Doctrine or generall Law, for payment of Tithes, was so diuulged (for a thing of necessarie obseruation) in the Church, that when it came after to be commaunded, it could not be, in any conceit, better ordered, then according to the diuision of limited Parishes. and, those wanting at the time when the Faith, and the Doctrine and Laws of Tithes, came first into those parts, how could it on (the other side) fall out, but that they should be taught due only to the Bishopriques? Which opinion also, it is no wonder, that those Bishops should be willing to preserue and continue, after Parishes were there diuided, and after Tithes came at length to be paid them. For long they preached, and much stirre was about it, before they could get a vsuall payment of them. Neither need you mistrust, that their right to Tithes, so cleerely

pretended in the Appropriations by the Bishops of Hamborough, was onely from the Episcopall right which the Canonists allow,

                      in case where the Lands, wherein the Tithes encrease, are not assigned to any one Parish Church. the contrarie thereof appears enough in other conueyances made to the same Monasterie; in which the same Bishop Athelbero, first in MCXLII. appropriats to it the Parish Church of Bishorst vpon Albis, cum banno fimul & cum omnibus appendicijs eius acquisitis, vel ac quirendis, and with the largest bountie, that the thing giuen might carrie with it. but afterward, in MCXLVI. hee graunts to it also a good part of the Tithes within the Banne and precinct assigned to the same Church; which plainely shewes, that he graunted Tithes of Lands, alreadie assigned to parishes. For his Parish Churches and their profits were no other, then what Foundations, speciall Endowments, and the Offerings of the parishioners, within their Banne or Limits, had made them. Which is well iustified by an old Rimer, that in Verse, which would grieue Apollo's heart to heare, sings Athelbero's liberalitie to the Monasterie, and expresses the Tithes of foureteen Villages, and other places giuen by him, and then comes to two Churches (that he afterward appropriated to it) Bishorst and Ichorst, and names them only as they had Bannes or Limits and parishioners; as

And then addes,

Where you see, hee diligently remembers also an Exemption giuen to it by that Bishop: which could hardly haue been, if the generall right of Tithes had not beene supposed in him. But out of these things you may probably collect, that by this time (that is diuers yeeres before the end of these CCCC. yeeres) in some of those Northern Churches, Tenths were payd more iustly, according to the desire of the Clergie, then in other places; where you shal find arbitrarie consecrations by Lay men, continuing till about MCC.. For if the Bishop had not had these Tithes payd, but had pretended only right in them, his bountie to the Monasterie had been to litle purpose. So in the Diocese of Oldenburg, about MCLX. payment was duely, it seems, made to the Bishop by all, sauing those which had improued the deserts of Wagria, which could by no means be brought to it.

Neither were the Danes in those Ages easier to be brought to the payment of Tithes to the Church. Indeed they so much abhorred it, that no greater cause was, why they barbarously betrayed and murdered their King Knout

And about the yeere MCLXXX. vnder King Waldemur the first, Absalon Bishop of Lunden would haue had them all paid their Tithes, and that vnder paine of an Interdict to continue against them: but they stoutly refused, and answered by publique message to the Clergie, That notwithstanding the Interdict, they should carefully minister Diuine Seruice and Sacraments, or els depart the Countrey: if they did neither, Non solùm rerum amissionem sed membrorum etiam truncationem demorarentur. And it is well noted by Krantzius, that the Northern Nations generally, were very hardly brought to pay▪ but after continuall and earnest Doctrine of the Church, and command of Princes, at length many of them yeelded; that is, as

may be coniectured, in the first halfe of the yeer MCC. Through the frequent vse of those arbitrarie Consecrations, and those Appropriations, Churches with their Tithes, and Tithes of seuerall possessions, were in exceeding number established in Monasteries, as well of Nunnes as Monkes. The Tithes of LX. of LXXX. or more Parishes, were by those courses, annext sometime to one Monasterie; which the Head and Couent possessed, not as any part, or as pretending themselues to be any part of that Clergie which made vp the Euangelicall Priesthood, or deserued them by ministring Diuine Seruice and Sacraments to the owners. For indeed, diuers of these appropriated Tithes were out of such lands as lay so distant from the Monasteries, not in other Dioceses only, but also in other Kingdomes, that the owners neuer saw or knew the Monks, or their Cloister, nor otherwise heard of them, but by their Cellarars or Prouosts that exacted payment. Whereupon it was in time of our Edward the third affirmed in a petition in Parliament,

Which is at large seene in an Epistle of Peter Abbot of Clugny to S. Bernard Abbot of the Cistercian Order at Clareuaulx, about the Monks of Clugny their possessing of a large number of Parochiall Tithes.

                           sar part 1. consil. 46. controuersie fell between Meginher Abbot of Herfeildi, and Burchard Bishop of Halberstadt, about Tithes of large Territories in Saxonie, appropriated to the Abbey. The Abbot stood vpon the Appropriation; the Bishop vpon his Episcopall right, which by the Canon Law is, and anciently was, the same with parochiall, in places not limited to any certain Parishes. The Bishops greatnesse with the Iudges of both Lawes, made the Abbot so despaire of successe in the Suit, that he prosecuted no further; but withall, summoned the Bishop to appeare before the Almightie in his Iudgement-seat, within some few daies

there to answer in the same Action; and verie soon after departed this life. Not many daies interceded, but the Bishop riding towards the Court where this Suit had depended, to dispatch some proceedings touching it, suddainly fell from his Horse very sick; and being carried into his Inne, gaue most strict charge (as one diuinely moued) that the Abbey should haue restitution and quiet possession of those Tithes for euer; and admonisht them all, that were by, That who euer had been parties with him in that oppression against the Abbey, should by the like Iudgement from Heauen, suffer as he did; confessing to the two Bishops of Magdeburg and Hildenesheim (then visiting him) that he was now called, according to the Abbots summons, to answere his exaction of the appropriated Tithes, before the Iudgement Seat of the Almightie: and soon after, hee most miserably died; Vto his Arch-priest, who had been his great Instrument in the Suit, the same yeere suddainly following him. But how euer either the vsuall practice, or this example wrought; a yeer or two after, this questioning of Tithes vpon Episcopall right (that is, vpon pretence that all Tithes of euery Diocese were due to the Bishop, as to the Rector of a great Parish; for such a right was most specially pretended by Bishops in Germanie, as is alreadie declared, and that both against Appropriations & arbitrarie Consecrations)

bred most perillous disturbances of State, and of no small consequent in those parts. For in the yeere MLXII. when Otho succeeded his brother William in the Marquisat of Turingia, Sigifrid Archbishop of Mentz denied him the relieuing of his Fiefs held of the Archbishoprique, vnlesse hee would giue him all the Tenths of his Demesnes, and compell all the Tenants of his Marqusat to doe the like. This was exceedingly distasted by the Turingians, insomuch, that they openly profest, they would sooner lose their liues, quàm patrum suorum legitima amittere; that is, then part with their ancestrell right of detaining, or disposition of Tithes, according to their vse, either of Infeodations or Appropriations. so you must of necessitie vnderstand it; and other passages in the Author (Lambert of Schaffnaburg, then liuing, who relates it) make that sense of it plaine. Neither was this Otho, for as much as in him lay, wanting to the Archbishops request. But in the yeere MLXVII. vpon his death, hee left ioy enough to his countrey men, in regard of that his yeelding about the Tenths, which none of his ancestors had giuen example of. but in him it was the chiefe Seminarie, as the Monke sayes, of the many calamities suffered in the Saxon Warre of that time. Great disputation of Canonists followed some six yeeres after, in a Councell held, about this Episcopall right, in

                     Erpesfurt, where not only the Tithes of Lay men were called Vide Schaffnaburg pag. 487. in question, but Tithes appropriated to the Abbeyes of Fulda and Herfeldt, and of all their possessions, were challenged by the Archbishop; his Canonists vehemently disputing for him; and the Emperor Henry the fourth, who much inuaded the rights of the Church, vrging him forward, that indeed hee might haue had a moitie with him. At length, the Abbots diuided with the Bishop by a speciall transaction; and, when they yeelded, the Lay men, seruing the time, agreed to giue him theirs also. But presently the exaction of them ceased. Hoc anno (MLXXIII.) post exortum bellum Saxonicum (sayes the Monke) nulla deinceps exactio facta est Decimarum in Turingia; gaudentibus Turingis quod occasionem inuenissent, vt traditas sibi à patribus leges manu militari tuerentur. And although the Archbishop againe questiond it, no successe followed. Of Appropriations of Tithes, hitherto.

And whereas they commonly suppose, that all these ancient feudall Tithes were at first spirituall, and transferred from Church-men (at the request of Princes) into Lay hands, and since wrongfully detained; surely it is an error. neither is there any ancient warrant sufficient for it: many of them were doubtlesse created by Lay mens Grants, as Rents-charge, Estouers, Turbaries, and the like are. Who can doubt of it,

Whence also may be strongly inferd, that the greater number of Infeudations were through Grants made by Lay men to Lay men, as Consecrations were, at their pleasure, made to Churches. for what is there only forbidden by the Councell, may be thought the greatest and most preiudiciall practice of the time against the profit of the Clergie. Neither is any prouision there made against the other kind of Infeudations, which passe Tithes from Church-men. And although the words & Ecclesiae non reddiderit, in the Canon (and in the bodie of the same Councell, in Roger of Houeden) seeme to suppose, as if it had been made for such Tithes as had been taken from the Church; yet indeed, the truer reading is tradiderit, as appears in the bodie of that Councell first fully publisht out of the Vatican, in the last Tome of the Generall Councells printed at Rome by command of the present Pope Paul the fift; wherewith agrees other Editions, but of lesse authoritie. And perhaps also some old Infeodations were made by Lay Patrons in the vacancie of their Churches, by the same challenged right as they alone made Appropriations. For, as by our common Law, the Patron and the Bishop may in the time of vacancie dispose of the Endowments (as by the Canon Law also, if the Chapters consent, or the Popes, be had;) so in those elder times, vpon

equall reason, when the Patron had the only disposition and interest of the Church (as is alreadie shewd) he alone sometimes granted any part, at his choise, it seems, to Lay or Clergie men. Why not any part as well as all? And that Patrons granted whole Churches into Lay hands, appears by diuers passages in Flodoards Rhemish historie, by that before cited out of Damian, and by the generall Councell of Lateran, vnder Innocent the second; where it is ordained, that they should be restored from the Lay men to the disposition of the Bishops. And an example is extant among the Records of the Apud

Through these kind of Grants, practiced both by Lay & Clergie men, Princes, and priuat persons, the ancient Infeodations of Tithes had their originall, as well as by Leases from the Church; and not by imposition of Tenths by Princes, as some Videsis Krantz.

                  The like libertie as Lay men had enioied (in not subiecting themselues to the payment of Tithes, according to the Laws of the Church, but bestowing or retaining them at their own

wills in most places, euen from the beginning of Christianitie, vntill about the yeer M.CC.) was another way purchased, for some time, by religious houses, so to discharge themselues of censure of the Canons, and that by Exemptions or Papall priuilege. For howeuer the Laitie iustified themselues by their secular right, admitting of Canons that toucht their estates, but as they saw cause in their own iudgments; yet Religious persons, who were alwayes of the Pontificiall side, and reckond in the Catalogue of the Clergie, and possessed diuers large Territories, durst not so oppose what was ordaind either by decree at Rome, or in Synods Generall or Prouinciall. Therefore when from the beginning of this Age, both Doctrine and Canons (of which more presently) had made the dutie of Tithes of a known right among the Clergie; Clergie men became somwhat strict obseruers of the payment, as you see plainly in that before cited out of Godfrey Abbot of Vendosme, with whom Peeter Abbot of Clugny agrees.

Hast thou at any time neglected to pay thy Tenths to God, which God himselfe hath ordained to be giuen him? or if thou hast done so or consented to the defrauding of the Church therein, first restore to God four-fold: and then must thou suffer penance with bread and water only, for twentie dayes.

But also other opinions he had, that being against the vsuall Doctrine of the Church, gaue him the name of Heretique, which he kept till his miserable death. This may suffice for the expresse testimonies of Opinion of this CCCC. yeers touching the generall right of Tithes. But although this opinion be so frequently deliuered in such termes as may denote the Tenth due by Gods Law, (that is, as it should at first sight seem, by the Diuine morall Law, or the Diuine naturall Law, which should bind all men and

euer, and are to this purpose both one) ye it is plain, by so much of the practice of the Laitie as the Clergie commonly allowd of, and by the generall opinion of the Time, that the persons held capable of them, were not only the labouring Priesthood or Ministering Clergie. The disposition of them in perpetual right to Monks, Nunnes, the poor in Hospitalls, to religious orders of Knights, and that out of one Prouince or Kingdome whatsoeuer into any other, in this time was allowd cleerly in practice; and according to that practice they were enioied. And the Clergie also generally agreed, that, by their Canonicall forme of conueyance, Tithes might be giuen (although some ancient

For, saith he, licet Decimae & oblationes principaliter clericali debeantur militiae, potest, tamen, Ecclesia omne quod habet cum omnibus pauperibus habere commune. But this might not be done, as they would haue it, by the Lay owner only. For he well addes, that neuerthelesse no Monasterie might, by the 
                        Vrban 2 c. 16. q. 7. c. 39. Canons,

lawfully receiue a conueyance of Tithes, ab illis ad quos non pertinet, id est à Laicis. yet you see cleerly that Monasteries and other Churches did receiue them from Lay men, and continually enioyd them. So that the chiefest difference twixt the Laitie and Clergie herein came to be, who should dispose or conuey the Tenths (according as they varied also about Inuestitures) not what persons (sauing in the vse of Infeodations) might haue a perpetuall right in them. and in that difference the Clergie yeelded so frequently in receiuing, allowing and confirming arbitrarie conueyances (as is before shewd) of Tithes, no otherwise then as of Houses or Glebe, to Monks, Nunnes, or Churches farre distant; that if they held them due to the labouring and Parochiall Minister (were he Bishop or other) by the Diuine morall Law, they did in this no lesse then commit against their own consciences, and exercise a kind of continuall and fearfull sacrilege. And indeed it appears that it was expresly held against the Diuine Law, to conuey Tithes to any other Church then where the owner vsed most commonly to receiue his soules food. For the Clergie in a Petition to the Emperor Lewes the second, in the Councell of Pauia in DCCC.LV. confidently affirmed that it was generally taken, that such a conueyance to another Church pro libitu was aswell diuinae

But then cleerly also, the chiefest practice of these CCCC. yeers was herein contrarie to the Diuine Law; a strange imputation to lay on the time, if at lest Diuine Law there, & Deus praecepit, and Deus constituit, & the like in their other pasages for Tithes, denoted the Diuine Moral Law. But if you so vnderstand it, how could that Lex Charitatis, that Iuo speaks of, so dispense with it? And with what colour could the Church so frequently practice against it, or pretend arbitrarie Consecrations to be so meritorious? But for an Interpretation of their meaning, by shewing how others conceiue that Lex diuina here, look in the next CCCC. yeeres. As for Exemptions; some complaints were made against them by such as lost by them; as you may

But out of them also may be collected, that the generall Opinion of the age was not, that they were due by the Diuine Morall Law. Was Rome, in those ancient times so bold to grant so many Dispensations expressely against the Diuine Morall Law? Yet also Iohn

And more to this purpose you

may find in him, where he tells you, that these Exemptions did derogare constitutioni Diuinae. But the Clergie generally was much against the vse of Infeodations of Tithes and Churches into Lay hands, although it were practiced by some Bishops and Religious Houses; who committed strangely, if they were also of opinion, that the right of Tithes was due to the Priesthood immediatly from the Morall Law.

But these are only against Conueyances of Tithes alreadie consecrated to Churches, and so hallowed. But, such as were by their first creation infeodated to Lay men, can no more be accounted (in their own nature) differing from other Temporall and Lay possessions, then Rents-charge, Estouers, the tenth sheaf, or the like at this day granted in fee by one Lay man to another. Neither indeed was the Churches right (what euer it were) to her Tithes properly diminished by such Grants. for if, at this day, the owner

grant the tenth sheaf of lands titheable, to a Lay man, may not the Grant be good, as a Charge out of the land? and yet the Church there hath her right as before. But the truth, it seems, was, that in those elder times, Lay men that had created a Tenth into Lay hands, rarely, or not at all, paid any to the Church; and those Infeodations, once made, gaue them greater pretence, of with-holding what the Church demanded: as if it had been enough to say, they must not, could not, pay two Tenths out of their land; and that if a Tenth were once created to any man, nothing els might be exacted vnder the like name. The same may bee thought on in Consecrations to Monasteries. For if Tithes had been held generally due and paid parochially (as now) then cleerly, although a Lay man had granted a Tenth to another Church or Monasterie, what other soeuer had been due parochially, had, Vide, si placet, 44. Ed. 3. sol. 5. & 44. Assis. pl. 25. notwithstanding the Grant, still remaind payable to the Parson. How could it haue been otherwise? And so no small number of doubly-paid Tithes had remaind at this day.

                  The Laws made in this time for payment of Tithes, were Imperiall, Prouinciall, and Pontificiall.

But it will, I think, fall out to be too bold an assertion of that faining Hector, who often, as it were, makes Laws for the Scotish Kings, that hee may relate them; or else hee was deceiud by them from whom hee took it. No good Authoritie can iustifie such particulars of that age there. neither is it to be receiud otherwise then as fabulous, and proceeding out of that common mistaking of ancient passages of

Church-reuenues, and confident (but ignorant) application of them to Tithes. But from that Law of Charles the Great was that exaction of Tithes, spoken of before by Alchwin; and thence are Tithes, in Ansegisus his collection of his Imperialls, so frequently mentioned, as of known right; and hence also had the title of the German Bishops, before spoken of, its originall. Those Capitularies, both of Ansegisus and Leuita, were collected by them about the yeer D.CCC.XL. in both of which, frequent constitutions are for Tithes, and for the

Yet with them also take the constitutions of Charles the Great, about the same time collected, but published by Vitus Amerpachius in the yeer M.D.XLV. as also others occurring in the collection of Melchior Goldaflus. These, together with the Lawes of the Lumbards, haue very many constitutions of about the beginning of these CCCC. yeers for this purpose; and one only shall suffice to be here transcribed.

DCCC.XLV. that little or no practice was of any of those Lawes of the Capitularies, in behalfe of the Clergie; nothing being more frequent, then not only the denying them what they would haue had, but also the taking from them what they otherwise possessed. Nor could they haue sufficient remedie for it, either in the Councell of Meaulx, where, vnder Lothar the first, they humbly sought it, or long afterward, as is manifest in the Moniments of the succeeding ages. But by the way, whereas some (both strangers, and of our own countrey men) out of the ioint mention of Nona and Decima in those Imperiall Capitularies of Charles and Lewes the first, fetch an example of a Ninth paid to the Church as well as a Tenth, and bring it as a character of the times deuotion; as if the Tenth had not then been thought enough, vnlesse a Ninth also, like a second Tenth, had been offered; it is a ridiculous error, and proceeds from grosse ignorance of the Common Lawes, Storie, Councels, and vse of that age. The Ninth and Tenth there spoken of, were only the rent due from the Tenants

of Church lands by the ordinarie reseruation of the Tenth, as of what was held, by many, of it selfe due to the Clergie, and of the Ninth, as of the Rent or consideration to be giuen to them as to Lessors for the receiued profits. so will it plainly appear in a multitude of old

Quod quidem nulli debet graue videri, pro meliori parte, videlicet semper victurâ animâ, quemque decimam Deo offerre, cum pro morituro corpore plurimae gentes coniugibus suis tertiam rerum legibus compellantur exsoluere. He admonishes, you see, and perswades, but commands not. He thought not, it seemes, his own power great enough to haue had effect in disposition of a Tenth part of euery mans reuenue, and therefore abstaind from command. neither could he haue pretended the autoritie of any Law or Canon, generally receiued into practice. for neither in his time, nor long after, till about MCC. were Tithes so generally paid (as since) without speciall Grant or Consecration (as is sufficiently shewed:) neither had any Generall Councell as yet once remembred the Dutie, or the name of Tenths. The first of the Generall Councels that mentions them, is the Ninth, that is, that of Lateran,

But they are there spoken of only, as they were receiud by speciall Consecrations. and in the Generall Councell of Lateran, held in M.C.XXX. vnder Innocent the second, feudall Tithes are in the same syllables mentioned, as in the Decree of Gregorie the seuenth, before cited out of the Councell of Rome. And this also, taken out of the Vatican, is to be found only in those two late and fullest Editions. But of the Generall Councels (before that Edition at Rome) ordinarily known and read, the first that names Tithes, is the Eleuenth, that was held vnder Alexander the third, in M.C.LXXX.

                         caput prox. §. 1. that of Lateran in the yeere M.CC.XV. held vnder Pope Innocent the third, about which time, Ecclesiasticall Autoritie became more powerfull, the Canons were more receiud

into practice (that before were litle, especially herein, obeyed) and Parochiall right to Tithes grew to be more established; whereof, more in the next and last part of our generall Diuision, and in the English practice. But if that Canon in the Lateran Councell, held vnder Alexander the third, against arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes without assent of the Bishop, might be vnderstood literally, and of new Tithes so created (neither is any thing in the Councell that denies that to be the meaning of it) then needed wee not perhaps seek further for the cause of that Assertion amongst our common Lawiers, That, before the Councell of Lateran, euery man might haue giuen his Tithes to what Church hee would. Who euer obserues the practice of the preceding time only, and the words both of that Councell, and, to the same purpose, of the other held vnder Calixtus the second, may well enough be perswaded, that the intent of those Canons were no otherwise. But in regard wee find that Canon of Lateran, vnder Alexander the third, to bee differently interpreted by Innocent the third, within twentie or thirtie yeeres after the making of it, and vnderstood only of Feudall Tithes formerly granted out from the Church into Lay hands (according as the Canonists after him also take it) we cannot be altogether so secure of that other interpretation.

                     Innocent; meaning, that vnder

                     Alexander the third) est inhibitum ne quaelibet Religiosa persona Ecclesias & Decimas de manibus Laicorum, sine consensu Episcoporum recipiat; per quod indirectè datur intelligi quòd sufficit consensus Episcopi, vt licitum Ecclesiae sit Decimas de manibus recipere Laicorum. Hoc autem de illis Decimis intelligimus quae Laicis in feudum perpetuò sunt concessae. But we must take it vpon his word only, and the credit of the following Canonists, that the Canon was so to be vnderstood. They may, as they will, vnderstand it by iudiciall application. but you may, at least, doubt still, that the Historicall vnderstanding of it, is to be had out of arbitrarie Consecrations before practiced. And it was euen equall to ordaine, that Lay men should not arbitrarily consecrate, and that they should not consecrate without assent of the Bishop; euery Bishop (I think) being supposed a carefull obseruer of the former Canons, which would haue induced parochiall right to Tithes, and generall payment. So that what in this kind might not be done without his assent, was conceiud as likely to be neuer done to the Churches preiudice. Let euerie able reader iudge here. but let him not be much swayed with the rable of late Canonists, that goe away cleer with this of Pope Innocent. When the Pope had said so, they made no scruple of the truth of it; and one takes it (as their fashion is) from another with too much easie

credulitie. But although this be not sufficient ground for that assertion of our common Lawiers (which cleerly, being rightly apprehended, is true; though lazie ignorance crie against it, euen to hoarsenesse) yet enough other will be found, whereof more toward the end of the tenth Chapter.

               IN these following times, the Canon Law grew to be of more force, and Parochiall right (through the Decrees made against that former course of arbitrarie Conueyances, and from the passages of Canon Law, that supposd the generall right of Tithes) became to be more established. But the Opinions of Canonists and Diuines haue been and are much different in the question, vpon what Law the generall right of them is immediatly grounded. But by the Practice of the Common Laws (for so much as I haue read) of all Christian States, they are subiect to Customes, and that somtimes as well in non payment as in payment of a lesse part. And Infeodations of them into Lay hands, yet continue in France, Spaine, Germanie, and elsewhere. And of Customes only and Infeodations wee shall principally speake in the practice of this time. For, what euer might here otherwise be rememberd touching Compositions, Exemptions, or

such like, is but a meer consequent of those Customes, and of the Opinion that makes them due only by Positiue, Human, or Ecclesiasticall Law.

It was in the same Councell ordained, That no religious Orders should receiue any Appropriations or Consecrations of Churches or Tithes, without assent of the Bishop. Ecclesias & Decimas (are the words) de manu Laicorum, sine consensu Episcoporum tam illos (that is, Templars and Hospitalars, against whom the prouision was chiefely made) quam quoscunque alios Religiosos reciperc prohibemus. This was confirmed in the Generall Councell of Lateran, held vnder Innocent the third, in the yeer M.CC.XV. And a Canon of the Generall Councell of Lateran, vnder Calixtus the second, in the yeer M.C.XIX. (wherein parochiall Ministers were also forbidden to receiue

Tithes, or Churches, from the hands of Lay men, by Inuestiture especially, Absque consensu & voluntate Episcopi) was afterward, in diuers Epistles of Pope Alexander the third, receiued

And although manie Decrees were before against those Conueyances, yet till these Generall Councels (vnder Alexander and Innocent) neither was the Autoritie of the Church so powerfull, neither were Epistles sent from Rome so frequent, to put that in execution, which had so been there established against that challenged right of the Laitie. But by this time, when the arbitrarie disposition of the owner was thus prouided against (reference being made to the Bishops assent, that was bound to square all things by the 
                        C. 16. q. 1. c. 45. & 56. Canons, which would haue Tithes paid parochially, and became to be much more obeyed then before) it grew frequent, to haue Decretall Epistles sent from Rome into euery Prouince, both to ratifie the former Consecrations and Appropriations, (which the Popes Vide Innocent. 3 in extr. de his qua s

But how little this common right had before been practiced, appears not only in what is alreadie declared, of the vse of the former time, and in the doubts made by Gratian in the Decree, and Pope Lucius the third, Alexander the third, and others in their Epistles touching it, but also in other occurrences of somewhat before the beginning of these CCCC. yeers, amongst which you shall find, that both the religious and secular of the Clergie would vsually take Couenants from their Tenants, to pay them the Tithes, and so preuent the Parson of the Parish where the land lay. If parochiall right had then been common, how could such a Couenant haue preuented the Parson? That practice is both related and remedied in the

As if euery man, by the choice of the place of his deuotion, in paying his Tithes, might make it his Parish. And when Alexander the third, about the yeer M.C.LXXX. was to answer the doubt touching Parochiall right of Prediall Tithes (that is, whether they were due intuitu territorij, in regard of the limits within which they grew, or obtentu Personarum, by reason of the person, and so to be paid to the Church wheresoeuer the owner for the most part receiued the Sacrament and heard Diuine Seruice) he knew not how to determine it; and withall acknowledged, that although it had been often moued, it was neuer resolued. Sane (saith 
                        Epist. Decretal. lib. 3. Ms in Biblioth.

Enough more like Examples are of that time. And you may obserue, that where Pope Alexander doth by Decretall command a Parochiall payment in the case of the Monks of

But so farre also was the former course of arbitrarie Consecrations now withstood, that not only the Lay owner might not of himselfe consecrate the right of his Tithes at will, but also, although the Bishops assent had ioind with his in conueying any Tithes (except only such as were infeodated to him before the Councell of Lateran of M.C.LXXX.) the Conueyance had been declared void; and to that purpose only, of passing Feodall Tithes out of Lay hands to the Church, was the Bishops assent

But although they might erre in the relation of the Canon, yet, doubtlesse, they had some speciall memorie, that Parochiall right to Tithes had been but of late yeers, and sometime after M.CC. receiud into the more known and practiced Law; although the Doctors so confidently before talke of it. For we must not doubt, but that those elder Canons, notwithstanding their great autoritie, were by most different degrees of time receiud into vse, and in some places, not till long after M.CC. as wee see particularly in that of the practice in the Diocese of Palentia, till M.CCC.XXII. which was, that euery man, wheresoeuer hee dwelt, yet might declare himselfe to bee of what Parish hee would, and to that Parish only giue his Tithes: Which was remedied by a Councell then held at Villadolid, vnder William Bishop of Sabina, the Popes Legat; where he begins with, Parochiarum diuisio à sanctis patribus instituta certitudinem Parochianorum & Decimarum debitam solutionem inducit. For indeed, Parochiall payment regularly was now

grown, by the Canons gaining force, to be the only debita solutio. The next authoritie of a Generall Councell for Parochiall right (after that of Lateran; wherein yet nothing directly constitutes it, but rather it is supposed, as of former time) is the Condemnation, in the Councell of Constance, of Wicklefes assertion, That Tithes were meer Almes, and that parishioners might, ad libitum suum (as his position was) eas auferre propter peccata suorum Praelatorum.

                  II.
                  In the Opinions that haue been since the beginning of these CCCC. yeeres, touching

Tithes; the chiefest to be obserued here, are those which determine, by what immediat Law Tithes are payable. For how euer very many other questions, about the dutie of them, are vsually disputed, yet resolue but this, one way or the other, and most of the rest that follow, about Customes, Appropritations, Exemptions, and such more, will soone haue little doubt. This point hath been controuerted both betwixt Canonists and Diuines, and between Diuines and others of their own profession. The Canonists (except very few) with one consent grounding themselues vpon the letter of some of those passages of Prouinciall Councels, of Fathers, and of Popes, before rememberd, generally deliuer, that Prediall and Mixt Tithes are due to bee paid iure Diuino, which is commonly taken for the Diuine Morall Law, and they vsually cite also the Leuiticall Precepts, to iustifie it. Yet doe they allow the right of former Tithes, Canonically setled by Cosecrations, Appropriations, and Exemptions also, for the most part. for to those they require Pontificiall Confirmations, or a supply of them, by such prescription of time, as may suppose them. For they take this Ecclesiastique reuenue to be no otherwise due to the Clergie by common right, but that the Pope (whom they, to the vtmost, maintaine, as they haue reason; for out of the Popes autoritie, first came their generall profession, as it now remains one) may

as a supreme Steward of the Clergies maintenance, dispose of this or that particular part of it. This is their common Opinion, although some, in the Point of Exemptions, haue made scruple. But where none of those speciall Titles precede, there they cleerly agree also, that by common right, all Prediall and Mixt Tithes are due parochially. Neither need

But by the way; though the Doctors commonly suppose the Action for Tithes to be Confessoria, and grounded vpon common right, yet that great and ancient Lawier, Bishop Durand, or Speculator, would haue them demanded by the Condictio ex Canone, that is, as we call it, by Action vpon the Statut. The Canons whereupon he would haue it grounded, are those passages of S. Hierome and S. Augustine in C. 16. q. 1. c. 65. & 66. and hee takes for his autoritie, why this kind of Action should be brought, that of

He liud long since, and perhaps, in regard of the various practice that had preceded against the common opinion of his profession touching the common right, he thought it most secure for the plaintife, to ground his Libell vpon the Canon, rather then vpon common right.

Whence it comes, that Iews and

                     Saracens (because they haue no personall vse of the Euangelicall Ministerie) are to pay none by this Law, sauing in case where they hinder the continuall payment of some former personall Tithe had from Christians. The best Autoritie they bring for personall Tithes, is that in Deut. XII. where Tithes and the offerings of your hands are spoken of. By reason of that most receiued ground amongst them, That the Tenth is due to the Church iure Diuino, their most common opinion is also, that euery man is bound to pay the whole Tenth, or the value of the whole Tenth,

of all encrease, notwithstanding any custome or prescription to the contrarie. Indeed, no reason is, that a custome should take away what God had immediately, and, by his Morall Law, established. The consequent is good, were the antecedent cleerly proued. But some of them, and such as are of no small name, deliuer their Law to be only, that custome cannot wholly discharge any Land of Tithes, but it may diminish the quota, or bring them to a lesse quantitie, or value; that is, that a custome to pay a Twelfth, Twentieth, or lesse, is good. This some also allow only in customes immemoriall, which they suppose to haue the force of a Papall priuiledge or exemption. But their common and receiued opinion is, that in Prediall and Mixt, no prescription or custome to pay any lesse part or value then the Tenth, or de modo Decimandi, much lesse de non Decimando, can be good. (Which well agrees with the Ciuill Law also. For by a rescript of the Emperor Anastasius

                     , no prescription may be of non payment of all or a lesse part of Tributes, Subsidies, or other Rents of the publique Treasurie; that is, of such things as are due to the Emperor in signum vniuersalis Dominij, as Tithes are supposed to God and his Ministris.) Except only, where the certaintie of some equall yeerly payment, without regard to euery annuall encrease, may be adiudged to be equiualent to a Tenth, by reason of the incertaintie

of sterilitie or fruitfulnesse. In this 
                        Gl. & Panormitan. ad c. in aliquibus extr. de Decimis, alij. case they allow a Custome, although the Tenth of euery particular yeer be not paid; because, Ecclesia, they say, potest se habere ad damnum vel Lucrum indifferently. But those other common opinions of theirs are so frequently obuious, that to cite Autorities for them, were but to imitate Rablais his Bridoye. Yet wee may specially remember, that the Doctors of the Rota (of Rome, I think) according to their profession also aboue C. yeers since, determind, 
                        Petr. Rauenn. apud Maiorem in sent. 3. dist. 37. quast. 36. 
                     quod quota Denaria est de iure Diuino hodierno die. But some Canonists withall are, and those of no small note, that agree, the determination of the Tenth to be only de iure Ecclesiastico, and that no more Ius Naturale, or Diuinum Morale, is in it, then what commands a competence of meanes to be giuen to the Priesthood. So 
                        Variar. resolut. lib. 1. cap. 17. 
                     Couuaruuias; so, some others. But few enough are of this opinion. All that are of it, make no doubt of the right of Customes (prouided alwayes, that a sufficient reuenue be possessed by the Minister) but allow the payment of them to be diminished or taken away by Custome or Prescription. But they are generally against the possession of Feudall Tithes held by Lay men (which they suppose, but falsely, to haue all had beginning from the Church) although Infeodated before the Councell of Lateran. Yet indeed some of them expresse an allowance of them; but that is rather in mingling

common Laws with their Canons, then writing as Canonists. The common Laws of all Nations (where feudall Tithes are; and I thinke certainly, in all Christian Nations feudall Tithes at this day are found) allow them now, and suffer the Canons to haue no power ouer them. And thence is it (lest they should grossely determine against such possessions as the Church anciently, as well as the Laitie, had by Infeodations setled, and Posteritie still maintaind) that some receiue into their Conclusions an admittance of what their own profession abhorres. Which may not be amisse said also of such of them as maintaine a Custome in the quota, or the like. For that is done rather by striuing to conforme the Canons to the common Laws, or secular Constitutions of the State where they liue (as our Ciuilians, in the practice of the ancient Canon Law, do here also) then by iudging according to the bodie of the Canons, that regularly allow no sufficient exception against parochiall payment of the whole prediall Tenth, but only Papall autoritie, or a Title canonically setled in some other Church. And the better to make these Infeodations stand with their opinions, they haue also a vsuall distinction of Ius percipiendi, and fructus Decimarum. The Ius percipiendi, they say, cannot be transferd, nor euer was, by the old Infeodations, because euery lay man is incapable of it. but the fructus Decimarum only, as they teach, is

what passed, and is still possessed, in consideration that the possessors should defend the Church from Heretiques and Tyrannie. The summe of what the old Canons haue, both against ancient and new Infeodations, is in the former Chapter noted; and according to them, how that distinction will hold, I see not. But, among them, great opinion is also, that all Feudall Tithes are to be restored to the Church, and that he which holds them, may not lawfully passe them ouer to another Lay man; but may only, with assent of the Bishop, giue them to some Church. Nec multum refert quae Ecclesia habeat dummodo extirpentur à Laico, as Panormitan sayes. And to this, they abuse that Canon Prohibemus, of the Councell of Lateran, that was not indeed made against Tithes then infeodated, but only against new Infeodations, as Pope Innocent the fourth there well teaches. For, saith he, Non loquitur de Decimis infeodatis, sed de alijs male detentis. Which iustifies what is in the former CCCC. yeers, against the receiued Interpretation, deliuered.
               
               
                  III.
                  The Diuines, of since the beginning of this time, haue had their seuerall Determinations and Doctrines vpon this point, and those may be, for method, put chiefly in a Three-fold difference; although rather the second Doctrine (as presently will appeare) were but an issue of the first. and the chiefe question among them comes to this, Whether, by Gods immediat

Morall Law, the Euangelicall Priesthood haue a right to Tithes, as to their Inheritance, in equall degree, as the Lay man hath to his Nine; or if they haue them only as by human Positiue Law, and so giuen them for their spiritual labor? that is, in brief, Whether by originall distributiue Iustice, or by commutatiue, they are payable? although, in the Opinion which wee shall here make the third, all Positiue or human Law be, for the most part, neglected; whereof, more presently. But in that (which we here make the first of those three Opinions) it hath been held, that the Tenth considered quoad quotam partem, or, as it is, a determined part, and denoted from that number, is due only by Law Positiue and Ecclesiasticall; but, quoad substantiam suam, or Cleri sustentationem, or in regard to it, as it denotes a necessary or competent part of the maintenance of the Clergie, that is due by the Diuine Morall Law. And to the purpose of this distinction, they interpret the Leuiticall commandments of Tithes; and deliuer that quoad substantiam suam, or as it was generally for the maintenance of the Minsterie in the Iewish Church, it is Morall or Naturall, there being (according to consideration of it so farre) the very Character of it writen in the Tables of mens hearts; that is, that Spirituall Laborers are to be rewarded with temporall bountie, as euery laborer is worthie of his hire. But quoad

quotam partem, it is, they say, a Iudiciall (or Ceremoniall, as some will) and that it hath been brought into the Law of the Gospell by Ecclesiastique Doctrine & Constitutions (both which we haue before related) proceeding from it only per vim eius exemplarem, or by imitation of the Iewish state, ordered by the Almightie; and not in that regard per vim obligatiuam, or any continuing force of it vnder the Gospell. And that the Church was not bound to this part, but freely might as well haue ordained the payment of a Ninth, or Eleuenth, according to various oportunitie. This is commonly taught by the old Schoolemen, Hales, Aquinas, Henricus de Gandauo, R. de Media Villa, Cardinall Caietan, and diuers others; (but fullest, in my iudgment, by Ioh.

                     Aquinas; Determinatio Decimae partis soluendae est autoritate Ecclesiae; and adds, that the ground of it, which he calls radix, is the text 
                        Epist. 1. ad Carinth. cap. 9.11., If wee sow vnto you spirituall things, is it a great thing, if wee reap your carnall things? The same is by Hen. de Gaudano 
                     
                        Quodlibet 4. q 28. exprest in these words, Adueniente Lege Euangelicâ & cessantibus Ceremonijs, cessauit & solutio Decimae, pro quota illa: sed mansit pro illo quod in illa erat iure Legis Naturae, & ad illud reduxit Lex Euangelica· And deliuers accordingly the right of them to be partim de iure Naturae & Euangelij, that is, quatenus vacantibus Diuino Ministerio communiter ab omnibus debet prouideri; and, partim de iure humano Ecclesiastico, or Positiuo, that is, quoad quotam partem. And to the same purpose, the rest. But whereas some make that learned Hales the first Autor of this doctrine; doubtlesse they erre. For howeuer Lex Diuina, Deus Praecepit, and the like, frequently denote the right of Tithes in the former CCCC. yeers; yet first consider, what is there admonished touching the practice of the time, and from thence you may, perhaps, interpret their meanings to be otherwise, then as they are commonly (and especially by the Canonists) taken. Could the Church haue, before his time, held cleerly, that the Tenth was due by the Morall Law, and yet, against their owne consciences, generally, giue way to, and practice also, those Conueyances,

which can haue no power ouer that which the Morall Law, euer binding vniformely, hath ordained? And indeed some great Doctors teach, that the Ius Diuinum, denoted in those passages of the bodie of the Canons, was no otherwise vnderstood, then only that we are bound to it by the Law Positiue of the Church, imitating the Diuine Iudicials (which retaine still, as Cardinall Caietan teaches, their vim exemplarem, though not obligatiuam) and is well enough thence stiled Ius Diuinum. Cum ergo dicitur (sayes the Cardinall

Neither doth he otherwise interpret other passages of the Fathers, which are to that purpose. Neque aliud, are his words, sancti patres intellexerunt. and remember also, that those Fathers affirme it not in disputation, but only in exhortation to the people; which is specially obseruable to any that knows the course of their writing. With Caietan also (in that the Law for Tithes is not Morall) Bellarmin, Suarez, Malder Bishop of Antuerp, and late professor at Louain, and others accord, and make it the communis opinio Theologorum; and some will haue it Ceremoniall, rather then Iudiciall. but wee dispute not thereof. But also an example is brought out of S. Ambrose his vse of Videsis I Maior. ad 4. se

of imitation of our Sauiors abstinence. Which shews, that what is from the holy Word exemplarily taken, is denoted sometimes with such attributes, as might signifie a Morall Constitution. And the truth is also, that Ius Diuinum is very often, and was, about the time of the bodie of the Canon Law published, taken for Ius Ecclesiasticum, or Ius Ciuile quod ad Ecclesiae administrationem spectat. as you may plainly see in an Epistle of Alexander the third, that liud till M.C.LXXX. where he directs, that a Church hauing been in possession XL. yeeres of Tithes growing in another Parish, should haue them still by that prescription, because in such case, de iure diuino & humano melior est conditio possidentis. Who sees not, that he there vses Ius Diuinum for Positiue & human Law of the Church? What hath the prescription of XL. yeeres, or primer possession to do with the direction of Diuine Morall Law? Or indeed, if he had meant, that Tithes, quoad quotam, had been due for the Ministers Salarie by the Diuine Morall Law, how could prescription haue had place against it? Part of that Epistle is

Ideo quid iuris sit in hoc casu, tua nos duxit fraternitas consulendos. Tuae itaque fraternitati literis praesentibus innotescat, quod iure diuino & humano melior est conditio possidentis, quoniam quadragenalis praescriptio omnem prorsus actionem secludit. And, that Ius diuinum was in that sense taken in these Ages, appeares also by Hales; where, although 
                        Part. 3 q. 51. membr. 5. he before held cleerly, that the commandement of the quota pars was iudiciall, yet he sayes, that Decima sicut Domini generalis cenfus is payable iure diuino, that is plainly (in his meaning) by the Ecclesiastique Constitution of the Church, imitating the Diuine Iudicials. Neither was the phrase otherwise vsed in that of the Generall Councell of Lateran, held before the time of Hales, in the yeer M.CC.XV. Illae quippe Decimae necessariò sunt soluendae, quae debentur ex lege diuina vel loci consuetudine approbatâ. I know the Canonists miserably wrest themselues about the interpretation of that place. but, when they haue done all in mistaking it, could the Councell think, that loci consuetudine, some were due, yet that all lege diuina; taking it for the Morall Law. for, if any, then all, by the Morall Law. Cleerly then the

Some refer that ex consuetudine to personall Tithes, supposing Vide Henric. Bowhic in tit. de dec. c. peruenit.
                      them due only by Custome or Positiue Law. And that also might be a tolerable interpretation, if at the time of the Councell such a distinction had been receiud twixt personall and prediall. But can it then stand for truth, that Hales was the first that brought this opinion of the quota being due by human determination in the Church, and not by the Diuine Morall Law? Indeed he was the first that accurately disputed the question as a Schooleman, and expressely made the distinction, but cleerly not the first that so held the point. To the former Testimonies hereof, adde that of Hugo de S.

                     Victore, who liud neere C. yeeres before Hales. He speaking of payment of Tithes before the Law, vnder the Law, and since, concludes with, Primùm igitur ante legem, paruulós Consilio nutriuit (Deus) posteà sub lege exercitatos praecepto tentauit. Nouissimè sub gratia perfectos in libertate spiritus ambulare permisit. By this first Opinion of the Schoolemen, to which the ancient Fathers are (you see) by some of them squared, no difference is to be made of Prediall, Mixt, and Personall Tithes, how euer some scruples about that difference, haue been needlessely

handled by them. For quoad substantiam Decimae, or Decimam sustentationis, as they call it, or, as the laborer is worthie of his hire, both are equally due. The Morall Law, according to them, designes not out reall possessions to be more subiect here to the naturall part of commutatiue iustice, then personall profit. And therefore also Alexander Hales aptly determines, that Decimae tam personales quam praediales sunt in praecepto, that is, both quoad substantiam, but neither quoad quotam. And, that in Venice, and other such Cities, where no Prediall Tithes are, a Personall Tenth is due by the Positiue Laws of the Church, as, in them also, a sufficient maintenance is to be had for the Clergie, by the Morall or Naturall Law. In summe, by this opinion, Customes of payment of lesse, of nothing, and other Ciuill Titles, that haue force against Ecclesiastique Law Positiue, are allowd, so long as the maintenance of the Minister be otherwise competent. Both failing, then is that defect to be supplied (notwithstanding any Ciuill exception) due by the Diuine, Naturall, or Morall Law; which, inscribd in all hearts, admonishes, that reward is due to euery laborer; much more to him of the Spirituall Haruest. Other questions about Tithes are disputed in the Schoolmen. but it is not hard to coniecture, how the most are to be determined (according to them) by their resolution of this alone; therefore I omit them.

You see how opposit this Opinion is to that receiud among the Canonists, twixt whom and the Schoolmen 
                        Ockam. lib. 1. dialog. 3. was vsually great dissention. It is not to be doubted, but that the Schoolemen lookt much further into all that they medled with, then the Canonists could do. And had the Canonists agreed herein with them, they might, with fewer absurdities, haue maintained diuers of their scrupulous Positions. And some of

                  The second Opinion in Diuinitie, is of those, that (hauing their first ground out of the determination of the Schoolemen) held Tithes to be meere Almes, and not to be paid to the Ministers of the Gospel by any Parochiall right, as a necessarie dutie to the Euangelicall Priesthood, but that they might be retained and disposed of at the owners will; especially if the Pastor See Wicleues complunt to the K. and Parliament artic. 3. well performed not his function. Of this, were both, some of religious Orders in

their Preaching, and also others opposit enough to them in Doctrine. The Dominicans and Franciscans especially (who began both about the yeer M.CC.X. and had in their Monasteries store enough of Schoolmen) made it a gainfull Doctrine to teach Lay men, that they were not bound to pay their Tithes to their Ministers, as to whom, by any Law of God, that portion necessarily belonged. For when the determinations had preceded, by which the quota was concluded, not to be due Iure diuino, they of this side neglecting (for the most part) the positiue and human Laws made for them, and regarding only the expresse Law of God, taught them due only as Almes, or as what debito charitatis, not debito iustitiae, was to be dispensed. By this Doctrine the Mendicants especially often got them to themselues (like the old Vide Zonar. in Concil. Gangr. Can 7. 
                     Eustathians) as Almes to be arbitrarily disposed of to such as took any spirituall labour. as also made their own detaining of them in Lands, out of which they were Parochially due, to seem the lesse wrongfull. but against their detaining of Parochiall Tithes a Canon was made in the Generall

With this may be reckond that of William Russell a Franciscan who vnder Henry the fift had publiquely preacht that the payment of personall Tithes to the Pastor, were not in Gods Commandement; but that it was lawfull for euery Christian to dispose of them arbitrarily to charitable vses. but of him, see more in the next and third Opinion, where the words of his Doctrin are exprest in a letter from the Vniuersitie of Oxford, to the Conuocation of the Clergie.

                  The third Opinion is of those who agree with the Canonists, that the right, of the quota of Tithes, immediatly is from the Morall or Diuine Naturall Law; some impudently vrging with a commandement giuen to Adam; others of them prouidently restrayning all their arguments to such grounds for the Conclusion, as may be had out of Abrahams example, referd to the application of it in the Epistle to the Ebrews; but others also not so circumspectly, taking

in the Leuitical commandements of Tithes for their most sufficient autoritie. For the first kind that talk of Adam; I think indeed that in the time of this light of learning, none haue durst venture their credits vpon such fancies. yet, that it was some opinion that had at least in pretence many autors in the Church of England, in the blinder time of our ancestors; I thence collect, for that in a Penitential made for direction of Priests in auricular Confession, and writen (as my Copie is) about Henrie the sixth, the Priests examination and aduise vpon the point of Tithing, is thus expressed. Hast thou truly doo thy Tithings and Offrings to God and to holichirch? thou shalt vndirstande that at the beginning of the worlde, whan ther was but oo man, that is to sey, Adam, God chargyd him that he sholde truly of al maner thyng giue God the Xth. parte, and bad hym that he sholde teche his children to doo the same maner, and so forthe al men into the worldis ende. And forasmuch as ther was that tyme no man to receiue it of hem in the name of holichirche, and God wolde not that thei sholde haue but IX parties. Therefor he commandid hem that of euery thyng, the Tithe parte should be brent. I fynd that afterward Adam had two sonnes Caime and Abell, Abell tithed truly and of the best. Caym tythed falsely and of the werst: at last the fals Tyther Cayme slough Abell his brother. for he blamyd hym and seyd that he tythed

euel, wherefore our Lord God accursid Caym and al the erth in his werk. So ye mow se that fals tything was the cause of the first manslaughter that euer was. and it was cause that God cursid the erthe it is literally transcribed as I find it. that writing of Cayme for Cain is ordinarie in the moniments of that age, as you may find in Wickleues works, Waldensis his Doctrinal▪ and others of like nature. But see here the effect of peruerse opposition on both sides. Some Friers, prouiding only for their own wealth, would haue had them reckond meer Almes, and so haue gotten them from the Secular Priests. and others would haue had them retaind by Lay men. The Secular Priests on the other side would rather instruct the Laitie with ridiculous falshoods (in the termes whereof they would not spare to abuse the holiest Name) then not seem to say enough for their own gain. In those times they did so. they saw the Friers dangerous doctrine to their reuenues, and therefore omitted no argument, no course in opposing it. a notable testimonie whereof is had also in that of Frier

Neither haue I elswhere seen so great autoritie against Russell. If Russell were therefore an Heretique, doubtlesse he hath had and now hath many fellow-Heretiques. for thus, many, nay the most of such as most curiously inquire herein, and diuers Canonists also that are for the morall right of prediall and mixt Tithes, denie that personall are otherwise due regularly then as custom, or Law positiue (which is subiect to custom) directs. But iudge you of it, Reader. I only relate it, and return to their prosecution against Russell. at length news came that he was at Rome, whither presently the Conuocation sent agents (to whom they allowd for an honorarie salarie, a farthing out of euery pound of Church liuings) that might there question him before the Bishop of Rome. a delegation of the Conisance of the cause was made to a Cardinall, who adiudged him to perpetuall imprisonment vnlesse he recanted. the Frier afterward brake prison and ran home again, where at Pauls Crosse (when nothing els could satisfie the secular part of the Clergie) he solemnly abiured his heresie, as they calld it. and to preuent the like in the doctrin of other Minorits, Chicheley the Archbishop enioind them all that in their publique Sermons

they should teach personall Tithes to be due by the Laws of God and the Church. Of later time others haue writen for the diuine right and generall dutie of Tithes. you may see Albertus Pius Carpensis against Erasmus, Baronius

But neither haue only single autors been lately of that side for prediall and mixt. whole Synods also of this age haue in expres words been for them, through whose autoritie & this ancienter before rememberd they might haue fortified their Conclusions with far greater names, then by citing some one or two late single men, as they vsually do.

Common Law (for by that name, as common is distinguished from sacred, are the Ciuill or Municipall Laws of all Nations to be stiled) hath neuer giuen way herein to the Canons. but hath allowd customes, and made them subiect to all ciuill titles, Infeodations, discharges, compositions, and the like. Of Compositions no more shall be spoken, seeing they consist rather in indiuiduals, then of any generall course. we only remember them here as one kind of discharge, among other that haue been allowd by common Laws. and where Customes, and Infeodations hold, no man can doubt of the lawfulnesse of Compositions. But of Customes; in the Edicts made by those Kings of France vpon those remonstrances it appears, that, what euer the Clergie supposed by their Dixmes introduitees and instituees de droict diuin: they complain of abuse only in due paiment of Tithes out of lands suiets & redeuables aux dits dixmes &c. that is, subiect and liable to the paiment of Tithes. neither in other words do the Edicts and their verifications giue them remedie.

or belonging to a spirituall Court, then only as they were annext to a Church or some other hallowed place. La raison est, are the words, que suyuant le doctrine de S· Thomas, nous Tenons qu'en la loy de grace, les Dixmes sont deues non de droict diuin, mais positif; & l'esglise en naissant n'a este faict Dame de ce droict, ains par le don & concession des Rois, Princes, & autres a qui de droict il appertenoit. whence, if they were annext to any Church, they were of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction that was giuen anciently for them; but being as feudall inheritance, although they once were in the Church, yet a new Character of being meer Lay is restored to them.

be pleaded, and the Officiall or Ordinarie allow it not, vpon complaint to the Kings Court, the defendant shall (as in case of Prohibitions in England) haue his remedie. This is declared by

And with him agrees Alfonso de Azeuedo, that writes vpon their Ordennanças Reales. But these kind of their prohibitions are grounded vpon their Ordinances, forbidding Decimas a Laicis exigi, quae per consuetudinem contrariam non consueuerunt solui, as Couarruuias sayes; and to that purpose was an Edict

                           ap. 4. about M.CCC.LXX. vnder K. Cazimir the

second, the Clergie (especially for the Diocese of Cracow) made diuers Laws (with his consent) vpon great differences about the paying of Tithes. One in speciall is, that Tithe must be paid of all that increases through the labour of the Plough, exceptis Rapis, papauere, caulibus, cepis, allio, & quae his sunt similia in hortis. and Si quis ligonisando plantauerit, Decima ab eo nullatenùs exigatur. Some other particulars they haue about paying Tithe of Hemp and Flax (which happens somtime to be more, somtime lesse then a Tenth; because the certaintie is only from the number of beasts vsd to the plough) and of other things. whence it appears that the vse of Tithing there is not consonant to the Canon Law. And Theodor Zawake deliuers it for a Law of this Countrie, that Decimae ex terris vastatis accipi non debent, which I think is to be referd to a thirtie yeers libertie of non payment giuen especially by Bodantza Bishop of Cracow, to such as were Tenants of Lands lately wasted by the Lituanians and Tartars which is declared in the Law, remaining at large in the Collections of Herbort and Prilusius. whither for more particulars I refer you.

is to haue all sauing a third part out of the two parts, which were to be imploied on maintenance of the Church.

               CAP. VIII. The Laws of England made in the Saxon mycel synodes or ƿitenagemotes, in Parliaments, and in the Councells here held either Nationall or Prouinciall, or by the Pope, for the due payment or discharge of Tithes in this Kingdom. Petitions or Bills in Parliament touching them, are inserted. all in their course of time.
               MOst of the English Laws, Constitutions, and Bills in Parliament, that are reserud to this place and here collected, were originally writen in Saxon, Latin, or French. and the Saxon, for the most part, were anciently (but it seems since the Norman conquest) turnd into a barbarous latin that yet better shews their meaning then a purer. Such as are found in Latin only I haue faithfully deliuered according to the Copies that gaue them. Neither durst I suspect that any Reader fit for the matter should need an Interpreter. no otherwise haue I done in what is of the old French; it can hardly be any thing but inexcusable sloth, that can trouble any Reader (that is fit also for the matter) in the

vnderstanding it. But in regard the old Saxon is known at all to few, and that hardly any better interpretation of the Laws writen in that language can be then the old barbarous Latin, I haue ioined alwaies (where it might be) both the Saxon and the Translation. To haue left out the originall, had preuented some freedom of the Readers iudgement, and tied it to the translators. to haue added no translation, had been as a purpose to haue troubled euen the fittest Readers with a strange tongue; which also to haue otherwise interpreted, had been but to enuie them the help of those Ancients (that had better means to▪ know the interpretation of those Laws) and so make them looke only as through spectacles of mine new made. I was willing to giue all (as the course of the collection would permit) that herein might help to make a ground of free iudgement. yet also where I see cause of note I adde it, but refer all to able censure. The Laws and Constitutions thus succeed.

If the credit of this be valued by the inscription, then is it about DCCC.L. yeers old. For, that Ecbert liud Archbishop of York from the yeer DCCXLIII. to DCC.LXVII. But the autorite of that Title must vndergo censure. Who euer made it, supposed, that Ecbert gathered that Law and the rest ioind with it out of some former Church Constitutions, neither doth the name excerptiones denote otherwise. But in that collection som whole Constitutions occur in the same syllbles as they are in the Capitularies of Charles the Great, as that of vnicuique Ecclesiae

coram testibus diuidant? The ancientest Canonica autoritas, for diuiding Tithes before witnesses, is an old Imperiall, attributed in some Editions

And other mixt passages there plainly shew, that whose soeuer the Collection was, much of it was taken out of the Imperiall Capitularies, none of which were made in Ecbert's time. Perhaps, the greatnesse of his name was the cause why some later Compiler of those Excerptions might so inscribe it, to gain it autoritie. for he was both brother to Edbert King of Northumberland, and the first also that, after Paulinus, restored the name of Archbishoprique, and the Pall, to Yorke. And the heads of a Synod held in Ecbert's time, vnder King Ethelbald, and Cuthbert Archbishop of Canterburie, are yet extant; but not any expresse mention is found in them of Tithes, although most of the particulars of Church-gouernment are toucht there.

                  The Autors of the Centuries 
                        Conaur. 8. cap 9. pag. 583. edit. Basil. 1567. haue a Synod held in the yeer D.CC.LXXXVI. vnder two Legats sent from Pope Hadrian the first with letters, for reformation and establishing of Church Laws, to Offa King of Mercland, and Aelfwold King of Northumberland, and to the

two Archbishops. the particulars of the Synod are related in an Epistle to the Pope from those Legats (which were the first that had so come from Rome hither after Augustine) wherein it is related, that Gregorie Bishop of Ostia, one of the Legats, went into Northumberland, and Theophilact Bishop of Todi, the other, to Offa, who with Kenulph King of West-Saxonie, called a Councell for the Southern patt, as Aelfwold for the Northern. Gregorie sayes,
That in the Northern parts ad diem Concilij conuenerunt omnes Principes Regionis tam Ecclesiastici quam seculares; and after many Institutions of Canon Laws there, the XVII. Chapter is, 
                     de Decimis dandis sicut in Lege scriptum est: Decimam partem ex omnibus frugibus tuis seu primitijs deferas in Domum Domini Dei tui Rursum per Prophetam: Adferte, inquit, omnem Decimam in horreum meum vt sit cibus in domo mea, & probate me super hoc, si non aperuero vobis cataractas coeli & effudero benedictionem vsque ad abundantiam, & increpabo pro vobis deuorantem qui comedit & corrumpit fructum terrae vestrae, & non erit vltra vinea sterilis in agro dicit Dominus. sicut sapiens ait: Nemo iustam Eleemosynam de his quae possidet facere valet, nisi prius separauerit Domino quod à primordio ipse sibi reddere delegauit. Ac per hoc plerumque contigit vt qui Decimam non tribuit ad Decimam reuertitur.

Vnde etiam cum obtestatione praecipimus, vt omnes studeant de omnibus quae possident Decimas dare; quia speciale Domini Dei est; & de nouem partibus sibi viuat & Eleemosynas tribuat. Et magis eas in abscondito facere suasimus quia scriptum est; cum facis Eleemosynam, noli tuba canere ante te.
                     The autoritie of this Canon, may be known out of what is there further added. 
                     Haec Decreta, beatissime Papa Hadriane, in Concilio publico coram Rege Aeelfwaldo & Archiepiscopo Eanbaldo & omnibus Episcopis & Abbatibus Regionis seu Senatoribus Ducibus & populo terrae proposuimus; & illi vt superiùs fati sumus cum omni deuotione mentis iuxta possibilitatem virium suarm, adiuuante supernâ clementia, se in omnibus custodire denouerunt, & signo Sanctae Crucis in vice vestra, in manu nostra confirmauerunt, & posteà stylo diligenti in Charta huius paginae exarauerunt signum Sanctae Crucis infigentes. Then follow some subscriptions of Bishops, Et His quoque saluberrimis admonitionibus, Presbyteri, Diaconi Ecclesiarum, & Abbates Monasteriorum, Iudices, Optimates, & Nobiles vno opere, vno ore consensimus & subscripsimus.
                     After this so concluded in the Northern state, the same Legat, together with Maluin and Pyttell, Embassadors from Aelfwold, take with them all those Decrees and Canons, and goe

to the Councell held vnder Offa for the Western parts, 
                     Vbi (as the words are) gloriosus Rex Offa cum Senatoribus terrae vna cum Archiepiscopo Iaenberchto (some call him Lambert) Sanctae Ecclesiae Dorouernensis (that is, of Canterburie) & caeteris Episcopis Regionum conuenerat, & in conspectu Concilij clarâ voce singula capita perlecta sunt, & tam Latinè quam Teutonicè (that is, in English-Saxon, which then was the selfe-same with Dutch or Teutonique) quo omnes intelligere possent, dilucidè reserata sint: qui omnes consona voce & alacri animo gratias referentes Apostolatus vestri admonitionibus (the Legats so write to the Pope) promiserunt se diuino adminiculante fauore iuxta qualitatem viriū promitissimâ volūtate in omnibus haec statuta custodire.
And Offa and his Bishops, Abbots, and some Princes subscribe with the Crosse to it. What Copie of this Synod the Centuriators had, or whence they tooke it, I find not. But if it be of good autoritie, it is a most obseruable Law to this purpose. being made with such solemnitie by both Powers of both States, of Mercland and Northumberland, which tooke vp a verie great part of England; and it is likely, that it was made generall to all England. In the relation of the Legats to the Pope, mention is of Kenulph King of West-Saxonie, his ioyning with Offa in

calling the Councell. but the confirmations of the Decrees haue no reference to him▪ But, by the way, if you examine it by storie and Synchronisme, Kenulph perhaps could not haue at all to do with it. For some of our old Monks expressely affirme, That in the second yeer

And that they then held their Synod at a place called Cealchithe. how could Kenulph be there then, as the Legats relate? Beleeue the Monks as you will. but indeed, an exactnesse here is not easie extracted out of the disturbed times of our Chronicles. They talk also of a Synod held in Wicanhale for the North parts, a yeere or two after. Doubtlesse they intend this same that is extant in the Centuries; if at least it be of sufficient credit. Neither can it be suspected by any circumstance in the subscriptions; which being so many, might haue by chance soon got among them a character of falsehood, had it not been genuine. In the printed Houeden, Gregorie, one of the Legats, is called Georgeus, perhaps for Gregorius. but my Ms. hath also Georgius. But if Henry of Huntingdon and Roger of Houeden giue vs the time right of the Legats comming hither, then is that mention of Kenulph, in their supposed Epistle to the Pope, a plaine

character of falsehood, or ignorance, in some transcriber; who also, in one place, hath Oswaldus for Aelfwaldus King of Northumberland. But those which speak of that Synod of these Legats, seeme to suppose it extending through the whole Kingdome. See also §. VIII.

The occurrence of these two names, is frequent in the Saxon Laws; and it may seem by this, that some other Law preceded for the payment of Tithes, or els that the right of them

was otherwise supposed cleer. For the autoritie of this and the rest comprehended in those of Alfred and Guthrun, obserue that in their title;

who both haue it also at large. But in Mathew of Westminster, no other Decima is mentioned in it, then Decima terrae Meae. Out of the corrupted Language, it is hard to collect what the exact meaning of it was. How most of the Ancients vnderstand it, is best known by the words wherein they summe it. Ingulphus thus of it; Omnium Praelatorum ac Principum suorum qui sub ipso, varijs Prouincijs totius Angliae praeerant, gratuito consensu tunc primò cum Decimis omnium terrarum ac bonorum aliorum siue catallorum vniuersam dotauit Ecclesiam Anglicanam per suum Regium Chirographum. And hee tells vs further, that Aethelulph, in the presence of his Baronage, at Winchester, offerd the Charter vpon the Altar, and the Bishops receiued it, & sent it to be published in euery Parish Church through their Diocesos. In Florence of Worcester it is in these words abbreuiated. Aethelulphus Rex Decimam totius Regni sui partem ab omni Regali seruitio & tributo liberauit, & in sempiterno grophio in Cruce Christi pro redemptione animae suae & antecessorum suorum vni & trino Deo immolauit. So also Roger of Houeden. An old French fragment of the

If we well consider the words of the chiefest of these Ancients, that is, Ingulphus, we may coniecture that the purpose of the Charter was to make a generall grant of Tithes payable freely and discharged from all kind of exactions vsed in that time, according as the Monk of Malmesburie, &

                     Iohn Pike in his supplement of the Historie of England, expresse it. Decimam, say they, omnium hydarum infra regnum suum à tributis & exactionibus regijs liberam Deo donauit. that is, granted the Tithe of the profits of all Lands, free from all exactions. for, the granting of the tenth part of the Hides or Plough-lands, denotes the tenth of all profits growing in them, as well as Decima acra sicut aratrum peragrabit, which is vsed for tithing of the profits, in the Laws of K. Edgar, Ethelred, and Knout, and accordingly also is this, of Ethelulph, related in the Saxon

Church, where he remembers it by tunc primo cum Decimis &c. So that the tithe of prediall or mixt profits was giuen, it seems, perpetually by the King with consent of his States both Secular and Ecclesiastique, and the tithe of euery mans personall possessions were at that time also expresly included in the gift, because (it seems) before that, the payment of all Tithes had commonly been omitted. The ancientest of Writers that hath the Charter whole is that Ingulphus: but questionlesse it is much corrupted especially in that of portionem terrarum hereditariam antea possidentibus omnibus gradibus. for what may that signifie? But in Matthew of Westminster it is farthest from deprauation of language; where, after portionem, follows terrae meae Deo & Beatae Mariae & omnibus Sanctis iure perpetuo possidendam concedam; Decimam scilicet partem terrae meae vt sit tuta &c. the priuilege or libertie annext to it is, that it should not be only free from all taxes and exactions vsed then in the State, but also from that Vide, si placet, Tit.

being due to the Church, were both in his and their hands hereby discharged from all paiments and taxes whatsoeuer. But should it be vnderstood only for a particular consecration to the Church of one time, and of the Land Sic intell

is dated at Wilton, that at Winchester. this in DCCC.LIV. the second Indiction at Easter. that DCCC.LV. and in some, the fourth Indiction, and in others, the third in Nouember. such a difference of Indictions may well be, if the Autors that deliuer it, added that note for the time that they conceiud it to be made in, not for the very Characters of the Date of the Originall instrument. for, Nouember falling in the fourth Indiction Imperiall, may be of the third Indiction Pontificial. the one beginning in September, the other in December following. that difference is in the relations of it between Florelegus and the Abbot of Crowland. and the Abbot perhaps reckond by the Pontificiall Indictions, and the other Monk by the Imperiall. if at least their Copies be not corrupted. But whereas in Malmesbury the date of that first Charter is DCCC.XLIV. Indict. IV.V.

                     Bede, are annext to it. Neither did the Autor of it doubt but that he had all the Councells of credit that preceded him, as his own testimonie in his Preface iustifies. there, after a short relation of the IV. most known and generally receiued, of Nice, of Constantinople, of Ephesus, of Chalcedon, he addes: Hae sunt quatuor Synodi principales fidei Doctrinam plenissimè praedicantes. sed & si qua sunt Concilia quae sancti Patres spiritu & diuino pleni sanxerunt post istarum quatuor autoritatem, omni manent stabilia vigore, quorum gesta in hoc opere condita tenentur. But to the same Volume is ioind another Collection, with this inscription; Incipiunt Pauca Iudicia quae desunt de supradictis, in which the old Canons of Rome (that is, the Codex Romanae Ecclesiae, or some other in the nature of it, which was receiud into these Northern parts, as a Director of the Church, in the

eldest times of Christianitie here, as you may see in our Protuli eundem librum Canonem, ait Theodorus Cant. Arch. in Concil. circa ann. 670. apud Hertford celebrato. Bed. Hist. Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 5. ancientest Church-storie) is cited, and diuers autorities out of those Fathers and a few of the elder Councells. But, no denominated Pontificiall or Synodall is rememberd there for Tithes. Only the Texts of Moses for Tithes, first Fruits, the first Born, and such more are numberd together; and then follows a Chapter de Diuisione Decimarum, with this declaration: Lex dicit; ipsi Sacerdotes populi suscipiant decimas, & nomina eorum, quicquid dederint, scripta habeant & secundum autoritatem Canonicam &c. in the self same words as are before attributed to the Excerptions of Ecbert. The exact age of those Statuta Synodorum, appears not. But they were collected about K. Athelstans time. at least, then was the Copie that remains of them writen, as may be coniecturd alone (if other reasons failed) from the similitude twixt the Character found in them and that of the Text of the holy Euangelists, which King Athelstan caused to be fairly writen, and consecrated to S. Cutbert. That text with those Statuta are both yet preserued from the iniurie of time, among those inestimable moniments of that noble Knight Sr 
                     Robert Cotton. For those Pauca iudicia that follow; they are of a later hand then the Statuta; but of what time, it sufficiently appears not. That Lex dicit in them may be referd to the Canon 
                        Sup. §. 1. related out of the Excerptions

of Ecbert. but whence that Canon is originally, I haue not yet learned.

the example of Iacob, with a Text or two out of holy Writ and S. Augustin, is added to moue deuotion. That translation agrees wholly enough with the Saxon, sauing in those words mortuis frugibus; the Saxon being yeerly fruits, which also another

                      Copie of this translation expresses by ornotinis frugibus, corrupted plainly from hornotinis frugibus, i. the fruits of one and the last yeer, or the yeerly increase. and perhaps some ignorant Monk finding ornotinis, and not vnderstanding it, because he would be sure to square it to his own abilitie of learning, made it mortuis. which kind of changing hath examples enough in bold but ignorant Criticisme. that which the old Translator calls viuens captale, is, libbendes yrfes i. liuing cattell, in the Saxon; which hath often

                  About D.CCCC.XL. Edmund King of England in a Micelne Synod, that is, a great Synod, or Councell, a kind of Parlament, both of Lay and Spirituall men (which are exprest by godcundra and ƿorldcundra) held in Londan, made this

Eleemosynae pecuniam. si quis hoc dare noluerit, excommunicatus sit. And all agrees with the Saxon, sauing only, that nothing answers to the word emendent. That Cyrycsceat is a Church-rent of Corn, or the first fruits of Corn yeerly in those times, and regularly payable at S. Martins day to the Church Videsis Ina leg. cap. 4. & 62. & apud Malmesbur. lib 2. c 11. Cnutonis R.

But what the Autor meanes by that Letter or Brief of King Knout, sent to the Pope, I as little know, as why hee cites that for

autoritie to proue what the Baronage did after the Normans. Indeed, an Epistle is Apud G. Mal. mesbur. lib. 2. c. 11. extant, which Knout sent into England (by Liuing Abbot of Tauis
                           •
                        ok) as hee was taking his iourney home-wards from the Pope. and therein, mention is of this Curc scet. of any other I am yet ignorant. That Aelmesfeoh, or Almes-money, was the Peeter-pence, due yeerly at the first of August, by institution, as some will, of King Ina, as others, of King Aethelulph. And they were called also Romefeoh, Romescot, Heorþpening.

                      made by Odo Archbishop of Canterburie (yet not, for aught appears by them, in a Synod) with this Preface, Ego Oda humilis & extremus diuina largiente clementia, almi Praesulis & Pallij honore ditatus, quaedam documenta omni Christicolâ non indigna, quae à praecedentibus illustrium virorum Praeceptis certissima comperi, ad consolationem Domini mei Regis scilicet Aetmundi omnisque populi excellenti Imperio eius subiecti, in ista cartula, coadunare decreui.

Primo capitulo praecipimus & mandamus vt Sancta Dei Ecclesia &c. And so goes on with some particulars which belong to Church-discipline;

the X. and last Chapter being only for Tithes in these words. X. Capitulo mandamus & fidelitèr obsecramus de Decimis dandis sicut in Lege scriptum est. Decimam partem ex omnibus frugibus tuis seu primitijs deferas in domum Dominij Dei tui. Rursum Propheta, Afferte,

Vnde & cum obtestatione praecipimus vt omnes studeant de omnibus quae possident dare Decimas; quia speciale Domini Dei est; & de nouem partibus sibi viuant & Eleemosynas tribuant. Where note, the syllables are of that which in the Centuries is referd to an English Councell of D.CC.LXXXVI. before in §. II. For this of Odo, although no expresse Occurrence denote, that it was in a Councell, yet you may much incline to beleeue it was in one, if you compare it with 
                        De gest. Pontis. lib. 1. fol. 114. a. what you find in the Monk of Malmesburie of him.

  This Latine agrees well enough with the Saxon; although in this last §. si quis, for Episcopi 
                     Vide §. XII. & XVII. 
                     Sacerdos, Lambard hath & Episcopus & Sacerdos illius Ecclesiae &c. But whereas the Translator vses the word Ecclesia only for Church; in the Saxon, that which he calls Matrem Ecclesiam, is denoted by ealdan mynstre, and that Ecclesia, in §. 2. si quis Thainorum, by Cyrican; whence, our word Kirk, or Church, is framed. For the difference of Church and Minister here, somewhat where anon wee speak of Parishes of that time.

                  A Councell or a kind of Parlament held vnder King Ethelred, by the aduise of his two Archbishops, Elfpheg and Wulfstan, (about the yeer M.X.) is yet extant, wherein Laws are for Tithes. But because it remaines only a Manuscript of about the time of the Norman Conquest, the Preface of it shall be here first noted, that thence the autoritie of it may be the better vnderstood.

The inscription of those Laws mongst which these are found, is, Haec instituerunt Ethelredus & Sapientes eius apud Habam. By this, and that of Edgar before cited, it appears that the Tithe of euery tenth acre according to the order of tithing the whole Farme, was to be paid to the Church. which also is made more plain in the next Law of King Knout.

and it is almost but a repetition of King Edgars Law for Tithes. and those two Paragraphs in King Edgars, the one touching a conueyance of a third part of the tithes to a Church that had right of Sepulture, the other concerning a Church that wanted that right, are also repeated (as many other Laws of the former ages) in those of King Knouts; which are called Lege

But howeuer those Laws are attributed to the Confessor; it is certain that as the Ordinarie Copies of them are, and as they speak in the published Volume of Saxon Laws, they are not without many mixtures of somewhat later transcribers.

                  The chiefest of the English Canon Laws, made for Tithes (both prediall and personall) is that commonly attributed to a Councel of Robert Winchelsey Archbishop of Canterburie, held in 23. Ed. 1. at London; some Copies Vide Lindw. in Prouin

                     oculi, writen by Iohn de Burgo Chancelor of Cambridge in M.CCC.LXXXV. it is called Constitutio facta apud Merton per omnes Episcopos Angliae.
These are the words of it, as it remains in the body of the Prouincial Constitutions. Quoniam propter diuersas consuetudines in petendo Decimas per diuersas Ecclesias inter rectores Ecclesiarum & Parochianos suos, rixae, contentiones, scandala & odia maxima multotiès oriuntur. Volumus & statuimus quòd in cunctis Ecclesijs per Cantuariens. Prouinciam constitutis, vniformis sit petitio Decimarum & proventuum Ecclesiarum. Imprimis volumus quod decimae de frugibus, non deductis expensis, integrè & sine aliqua diminutione soluantur: & de fructibus arborum: & de seminibus omnibus, & de herbis ortorum nisi Parochiani competentem fecerint redemptionem pro talibus decimis. Volumus & statuimus etiam quod decimae de foenis vbicun
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         crescant, siue in magnis pratis siue in paruis siue in cheminis exigantur, & prout expedit Ecclesiae persoluantur. De nutrimentis autem animalium scilicet de agnis; Statuimus quod pro sex agnis &· infra, sex oboli dentur pro decima. Si septem sint agni in numero, septimus agnus detur pro decima rectori, ita tamen quod rector Ecclesiae qui septimum agnum recipit, tres obolos in recompensationem soluat parrochiano

à quo decimam illam recepit. Qui octauum recipit, det denarium. Qui verò nonum, det obolum parochiano vel expectet rector vsque ad alium annum donec plenariè Decimum agnum possit recipere si maluerit: & quum ita exspectat semper exigat secundū agnum meliorem vel tertium ad minus de agnis secundi anni: & hoc pro expectatione primi anni. Et ita intelligendum est de Decima lanae. Sed si oues alibi in hyeme & alibi in aestate nutriantur diuidenda est decima. Similiter siquis medio tempore emerit vel vendiderit oues, & certum sit à qua parrochia illa oues venerint: carundem diuidenda est decima sicut de re quae sequitur duo domicilia. Si autem incertum fuerit, habeat illa Ecclesia totam decimam infra cuius limites tempore tonsionis inueniuntur. De Lacte verò volumus quod decima soluatur dum durat; videlicet de casco tempore suo. Et de lacte in autumno & hyeme nisi parochiani velint pro talibus facere competentem redemptionem, & hoc ad valorem decimae & commodum Ecclesiae. De prouentibus autem molendinorum volumꝰ quod decimae fideliter & integrè soluantur. De pasturis autem & pascuis tam non communibus quam communibus statuimus quod decimae fideliter persoluantur: & hoc per numerum animalium & dierum vt expedit Ecclesiae. De piscationibus & apibus sicut de omnibus alijs

bonis iuste acquisitis quae renouantur per annum, statuimus quòd decimae soluantur & exigantur debito modo. Statuimus etiam quod decimae personales soluantur de artificibus & mercatoribus scilicet de lucro negociationis▪ Similiter de carpentarijs, fabris, cementarijs textoribus, pandox atricibus, & omnibus alijs operarijs stipendarijs, vt videlicet dem Decimas de stipendijs suis nisi stipendarij ipsi aliquid certum velint dare ad opus vel ad lumen Ecclesiae si rectori ipsius Ecclesiae placuerit. 
                     then a word or two of Mortuaries; after which, 
                     Sed quoniam inveniuntur multi Decimas sponte dare nolentes; Statuimus quod parochiani moneantur primo secundo & tertio vt decimas Deo & Ecclesiae fideliter soluant. Quod si non emendauerint primò ab ingressu Ecclesiae suspendantur, & sic demùm ad solutionem decimarum per censuram Ecclesiasticam si necesse fuerit compellantur. Si autem dictae suspensionis relaxationem vel absolutionem petierint: ad ordinarium loci mittentur absoluendi: & debito modo puniendi. Rectores autem Ecclesiarum seu Vicarij aut Capellani annui qui predictas decimas predicto modo propter formidinem hominum seu fauorem, timore Dei postposito, vt predictum est, cum effectu non petierint: pena suspensionis innodentur donec dimidiam marcam argenti pro sua inobedientia Archidiacono

loci persoluant.
And then follow two other Constitutions, vnder Winchelsey's name, for some more peculiar order in payment. But that first referd to him, is in a Ms.

(written of about the time of Henry the sixt) of the English Episcopall Constitutions, seuerally thus titled, Constitutio Domini Stephani de Langtone Archiepiscopi edita de modo Decimandi. Stephen of Langton was Archbishop vnder King Iohn. But it is not extant in the Synod of his time.

                      Gloues, Stockings, or some such bribes, before they would permit them take that right, which God, as it is there inserted, in signum vniuersalis Dominij sibi reddi praecepit, & pro suo cultu Clericis assignauit. All such offendors are branded with Excommunication: and another Constitution of a Councell of Pauls, held in 17. Ed. 3. vnder Iohn Stretford Archbishop of Canterburie, is to the selfe-same purpose.
               
               
                  XXVIII.
                  For Tithe of Copis Wood, or Silua caedua, also in that of Stretford, was a

Nos igitur aduertentes quod si sua portione Ecclesia sit defraudata diutinè, crimen praeterea non minuitur sed augetur: ac fames & penuria omniumque rerum egestas opprimunt bene Decimas non soluente; huiusmodi declaramus pouisione Concilij Siluam Caeduam, illam fore quae cuiuscunque existens generis arborum in hoc habetur vt cedatur, & quae etiam succisa rursus ex stirpibus aut radicibus renascitur; ac ex ea Decimam vtpote realem & praedialem Parochialibus ac Matricibus Ecclesijs persoluendam; nec non siluarum possesso res huiusmodi ad praestationem Decimarum lignorum ipsorum excisorum in eis, sicut feni & bladorum omni censura Ecclesiastica fore Canonicè compellendos.
By this, Tithe of all kind of Wood was payable. But in the 
                        Rot. Parl. 17. Ed. 3. art. 28. Parlament with which that Conuocation

was held, a Petition was exhibited by the Commons, Que nul home soit tret en plee en Court Christien pur Dismes de bois ou de south bois si nonn en lieux ou tielx Dismes soloient estre donez. And the Answer was, Soit fait de cella auxi come il ad este fait einz cez heures.
                  
               
               
                  XXIX.
                  And the yeer following, in the next Parlament, a 
                        Rot. Parl. 18. Ed, 3. art. 9. complaint was against that Constitution by the Commons. Item pria le Commen que come Constitution soit fait per les Prelats a prendre Disme de chescun mannere de Bois quel chose ne fuit vnques vsee, & que niefs & femes poent faire testament que est contre reson. que plese per lui & per son bon conseil ordainer remedie, & que son people demoerge en mesme l'estate qu'ils soloient estre en temps de touts ses progenitours, & que Prohibitions soiēt grantes a touz ceux que sont empledes de Dismes de bois sans auoir consultation. Wich was no otherwise answerd, but with, Le Roy voet que ley & reason ent soient faits.

                        1. Ed 3. art. 48. 21. Ed. 3. a Petition was touching the same matter put thus in by the Commons. Item monstre la Commune come nadgairs Lerceuesque de Cantirbiry & les autres Prelats ordenerent vne Constitution a doner Dismes de subbois venduz tant solement, la ou auant ces heures nulles Dismes furent donez, ore les gentz de Seint Esglise per force de la Constitution pernent & demandent les Dismes auxibien de gros bois come de subbois venduz & nient venduz econtre

oe qu'ils ont vsez puit temps de memoire, a grant damage de la Commone de quoi ils prient remedie del vn point & del autre. To this is answered. L'erceuesque de Cantirbiry & les autres Euesques ont responduz que tiele Disme nest demandee per reson de la dit Constitution forsque de subbois. But I well conceiue not why they complain of the Constitution, as made only for the Tithe of Wood sold. no such thing appeares in it, that iustifies their supposition.
               
               
                  XXXI.
                  This tithing of Wood, and of such other things as were not of Custome paid, still vexed the Commons. And therefore againe in a Parlament 
                        Rot. Parl. Fest. Hill. 25▪ 
                        Ed. 3. art. 37. of 25. Ed. 3. they exhibit this Petition. Item pria la Commone, que si la Clergie en droit des Dismes de haut bois & southbois ou d'autre chose riens demandent ou attemptent de nouel forsque solement ceo & en les lieus d'ont ils ont este d'aunciens temps seisis come en le droit de lour Esglises, que pleise a nostre Seigniour le Roy ent granter Prohibition sans Consultation a touz ceux que le voillent demander en tiel cas, & que les dites gents de S. Esglise soient defenduz a demander Dismes de grosse bois. Here the Commons would haue had such a libertie of discharge of Tithes not vsually paid, as the Philippine in France, and the like Edicts of some other Nations giue the subiect. But the answer was, Le Roy & son Conseil se voillent de ceste Petition auiser.
                  
                  
                     XXXII. But vpon new Petition, by the Lords Temporall and Commons in the Parlament of 45. Ed. 3. it was enacted (as you see in the published Statutes, agreeing with the Record) That Tithe should not be exacted of great Trees, being of XX. yeeres growth, or aboue. and that vpon a Suit commenced in the Spirituall Court for such Tithes, a Prohibition should be granted, as it had been in former time also vsed. but that vse, it seemes, had been somewhat discontinued, through a reuerence giuen to that Synodall Canon of Archbishop Stretford. Although in 50. Ed. 3. fol. 10. b. Belknap saies, That it was neuer seen, that Tithes had been demanded of great Trees and of Timber. This Statute

                  XXXIII.
                  Yet, notwithstanding this Statute, the Clergie were not so contented; but vnder pretence that it was not indeed, by sufficient autoritie, made a Statute, but only an Ordinance (the contrarie whereof appears both in the Roll and in the consent of following time) oft times afterward brought the Temporaltie in question vpon their Canons; insomuch, that in the Parlament of

Thus did the Clergie and Commons so differ touching the execution of the Canons; and insomuch, that afterward also the Commons put in a Bill,

                  By the Statute of Dissolution of Monasteries of 31. Hen. 8. chap. 13. it was enacted, That the King and his Patentees should

hold the Possessions of the dissolued Monasteries discharged and acquited of payment of Tithes, as freely, and in as large and ample manner, as the Houses of Religion held them at their time of the dissolution.
               
               
                  XXXVIII.
                  After the dissolution of Monasteries, to which, diuers Tithes and Parish Churches had been appropriated, and were now setled in the Crowne, and thence conueyed into Lay hands, an Act was made in 32. Hen. 8. cap. 7. commanding euery man, fully, truly, and effectually, to diuide, set out, yeeld or pay all and singular Tithes and Offerings, according to the lawfull Customes and Vsages of the Parishes and Places where such Tithes or Duties shall grow, arise, come, or be due. And remedie is giuen for Ecclesiastique persons before the Ordinarie; and for Lay men, that claimed appropriated Tithes by grant from the Crown, in the secular Courts, by such actions as vsually Lay possessions had been subiect to.
               
               
                  XXXIX.
                  By the Acts of 27. Hen. 8. cap. 21. 37. Hen. 8. cap. 12. and the Decree made vpon them, the Citizens and Inhabitants of London and the Liberties were commanded to pay their Tithes to the Parsons, Vicars, and Curats of the Citie, according to a rate of the rents of their houses; that is, two shillings nine pence for euerie pound. and that if no rent be reserued, the Tithe should be duly paid, according to what

their houses had been last letten for. and according to that also, are owners bound to pay. But a Prouiso is in the Decree, That where a lesse summe then after two shillings nine pence the pound hath been accustomed to bee paid for Tithes, in such places the former custome should be continued. And some other particulars are in it, which are too long to be here transcribed. you may easily see it whole. But anciently, in London, on euery Sunday and other principall Feast day; the chief maintenance of the Ministers was encreased, by a farthing offered out of euery tenne shillings of rent.

                     , (and that Ordinance, as I haue heard, was either made by Roger Niger Bishop of London, in 13. Hen. 3. as a new one, or as a confirmation of former vse. as which of these, I purposely abstain here to enquire) in dicta Ciuitate, tenentur singulis Dominicis diebus & in principalibus Festis & Sanctorum Apostolorum & aliorum quorum Vigiliae ieiunantur offerre pro singulis X. solidis redditus domus quam inhabitant vnum quadrantem. And the LII. farthings so yeerly paid on Sundaies only, came so neere to the iust Tenth of the rent, that they were thought on as a Tithe paid; the other being reputed rather by the name only of Offerings. Which you may see in the same Lindwood; where he disputes the question, whether those farthings excused the Citizens from personall Tithes of their gaines;

and concludes, that they did not. But before these Acts and the Decree, no Tithes, as Tithes, were generally paid in that Citie. in some places Vide 16. Ed. 3. quare impedit 147.38. Ed. 3. fol. 13. a. Grants case in Report. 11. fol. 16. a.

                  To these may not amisse be added those Laws for Tithes, proposed by the VIII. persons chosen to begin a new body of Canon Law for England in 5. Ed. 6. according to the first purpose of the Statut of 25. Hen. 8. cap. 19. (which was seconded also by the Statut of 3 and 4. Ed. 6. cap. 11.) whereby XXXII. persons assigned by the King should haue made it. neither were those VIII. to haue giuen sufficient autoritie to it according to those Statuts, without approbation of XXXII. afterward that should haue censurd their reformation. The VIII. were Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterburie, Thomas Bishop of Elie, Richard Cox the Kings Almosner and Peter Martyr Doctors of Diuinitie, William May and Rouland Tailor Doctors of Law, and Iohn Lucas and Richard Gooderik Esquires. In what they proposed, is found a constitution in the Kings name that all predial tithes should be paid in kind to the Ministerie integrè & expletè (with an exception of timber Trees of XX. yeers growth) as also of the profits of Milles, of Turbaries, Cole-mines, Quarries of stone and all other of like kind. Of all Agistments

also Tithes are there paiable, and of the encrease of all kind of beasts, wild and tame; of fish, of butter, cheese, milk, wool, wax. and the Statut of 2. and 3. Ed. 6. for Tithes is there receiud for so much of it as is not against a generall paiment which they would haue had ordaind. But these as the rest in the Volume with them, were only intended for Laws, but neuer had sufficient autoritie or confirmation. The intent was first that those Canon Laws only, which according to the purpose of the two Statuts of Hen. 8. and Ed. 6. should be compiled, might haue autoritie in the Vniuersities, and force in practice; but so, that there might still be praeseruatio legum nostrarum communium in suo vigore remanentium, as the words are in the Patent of Ed. 6. that authorizes the VIII. persons to consult about them.
                  For our Laws of Tithing either made or desired, thus much. But before we speak of the Practice, it is requisit that we enter into some disquisition touching Parishes or Parochiall right according wherto at this day from ancient time the paiment of Tithes is regularly performed.

                  For the Britons; litle or no Testimonie of credit is extant that discouers the Ecclesiasticall policie vsed by them, in their primitiue times, or declares the possessions of their Hierarchie. And we omit here wholy what might be collected out of that fabulous tale of Augustine preaching at Cometon in Oxfordshire, whereof more in the next Chapter. Although K. Lucius had instituted XXVIII. Bishops, and III. Archbishops (as the British storie tells vs) yet, how in those Dioceses any distinct Parishes were, appears not expresly. But we may very well think that such kind of Parishes only were in those Bishopriques as we haue alreadie 
                        Chap. 6. §. 3. shewd to haue been in the Primitiue Church elswhere. neither is it likely that in those times, the custom of this Island therein should differ from what was euen vniformly receiud through those parts of Christendom, wherof we haue best testimonie remaining. But if all ancient autoritie were of credit, Parish Churches expresly mentiond of about the time of CCCCXC. and endowd as at this day might be found among the Britons.
For when Dubritius was made Archbishop of Southwales which they called Dextralis Britannia, and his See appointed at Landaff vnder Mouris Prince of that Wales, diuers Churches with their endowments of Tithes, Oblations, and other profits were appropriated to him and his successors; by the relation of an old Autor. Propter sanctitatem

But this Autor wrote not before about the beginning of the last CCCC. yeers from Christ, and spake of these things in the phrase of his own time. the hand and context and their relations in him iustifie it. he talks, you see, of Churches endowd and appropriated and founded, as if he meant no other then such as now are conueiable by Patrons and Ordinaries in the course of appropriations vsed in later ages, and filled with Incumbents that had in them like estates and particular interest in the profits as Parsons at this day. indeed, that in those times Churches were built here, no doubt can be made; neither is it to be conceiud how 1.

                  II.
                  For the age of the Saxons; we read that Augustin and his companie, when they first came to K. Ethelbert in Kent, began there to imitat 
                        Beda lib. 1. cap. 26.

                      whence we haue it) of his Abbey in Canterburie, talks of alias quas fabricaui Ecclesias. And doubtlesse those Churches which they built, or repaired, as also the Temples of the Gentiles which by aduise of Pope Gregorie to Mellitus were not to be destroied, but conuerted to Christian seruice, had some kind of limits of adioining Villages or Towns, and so were in that respect Parochiall. But those limits and Churches were variously chosen and assigned to ministring Priests, according to the conuenience of the assembling of the Neighbour-inhabitants; but not so ordaind that euery Parishioner was bound to keep his deuotion within the limits of this or that parish church. that is, Parishes were then limited only in regard of the ministring Presbyterie (whence they were called scriftscyrean i. circuits, within which the Priests exercised their shriuing) but not in regard of the profits receiud from the Parishioners. For the whole Diocese (first of Canterbury, thē of the other elder Bishopriques, as they were instituted) was indeed the only limited Parish, in regard of the Parishioners profits. & the Clergie of the Bishop, that is, his familie of Church men, were the Curats in inferior Churches, according as the Bishop appointed and altered them; and whatsoeuer they receiued through

deuotion of good Christians, made vp a common treasure for the whole Diocese (whence it followd, that it was not materiall at what church any Parishioner offerd his Christian bountie, so he did it within the Diocese) which was both consonant to what is found to be the vse of other Churches in the Primitiue times, and is also confirmed by that Augustin in his question to Pope Gregorie, touching Bishops. he demanded qualiter cum suis Clericis conuersentur? vel de his quae fidelium oblationibus accedunt Altari, quantae debeant fieri portiones? whereto the Pope answers that the custom is generally to make a quadripartit diuision for the Bishop, for his Clergie, for the Poor, and for reparation of Churches. but he admonishes him, that in the tendernesse of the English-Saxon Church, he and his Clergie should still imitate the communitie of all things vsed in the Primitiue times vnder the Apostles. The Saxon of that question Extat in Beda exemplatis Saxonici Ms. lib. 3. in Bibl. Cottoniana is obseruable.

So that you may collect that in these Primitiue times of the English-Saxon Church the Bishop and the whole Clergie of the Diocese were as one body liuing vpon their endowments (bestowd on the Bishoprique) and their treasure that came from the sundrie places of deuotion whither som one or other of them at the Bishops appointment, was sent to preach the Word and minister the Sacraments. euery Clerk hauing his diuidend for his maintenance. Neither in these elder times, I think, did any of these of his Clergie or Chaplains vsually reside elsewhere then with him at his Bishoprique (as Deanes and Chapters at this day) or in some Monasteries whence they might as occasion required, at certain times go into those Parishes which were distinguished only for seuerall functions of those Chaplains, lest want of such distinction might the sooner haue caused also a want of speciall discharge of this or that Cure. so that there were singularum Ecclesiarum Presbyteri

not to leaue the Church for which he was so ordained. And from their residence with the Bishop, or out of the Parish in Monasteries, came it, as it seemes, that they were but rarely seen abroad among the people. for so rarely were they seen abroad, that when euer any of them were espied in the Countrey, the people vsed presently to flock about him, and with all reuerence humbly to beseech his Benisons, either by signing them with the Crosse, or in holy prayers for them; and, with all earnestnesse of attention, they heard what he preached.

How long this communitie in euery Diocese between the Bishop and his attending Clergie (which is denoted often by the name of Episcopi Clerus) continued, fully appears not. But, that it was not out of vse till past more then C. yeers after Augustines comming, that is, till past D.CC. yeers from Christ, may be coniectured out of those testimonies of Bede, which extend as farre.
               
               
                  III.
                  Yet it is commonly receiud, that Honorius,
                     
the first Archbishop of Canterburie after Augustine, about the yeer D.C.XXX. first diuided his Prouince into Parishes. And in the late historie of the Archbishops of Canterburie, written by Mr 
                     Ioscelin, it is thus deliuered of him. Neque solùm Episcopos tanquam superiores turrium custodes Ecclesiae superimpo suit, sed etiam, Prouinciam suam primus in Parochias diuidens, inferiores Ministros ordinauit. And according to this, haue some of our greatest and most learned Writers related. But I doubt much how it can at all stand with truth. For if Parochiae be here meant only for such as were assigned Limits for those which were sent arbitrarily from the Bishop, out of the number of his Chaplains, or his Clerus, residing for the most part, in those elder times, with him at his Bishoprique; then cleerely, Honorius was not the first that made diuision of them. Such kind of Parochiae are euen neere as ancient as Bishopriques; and questionlesse, in Augustines time. how could otherwise, Gods Seruice be orderly had in the Infancie of the Church? And when euer seuerall Churches for Christian Seruice, or other places for holy Assemblies, began, then began such Parochiae. And that Churches were built here before Honorius his time, is before manifested. If, on the other side, Parochiae be taken for what it's vsually vnderstood, that is, for such Limits as now make Parishes, bounded as well in regard of the profits

receiud from the Parishioners (due only to the Minister of that Church) as of the Incumbents function and residence; how will that stand with the communitie of Ecclesiastique profits, and the Bishops and his Clergies liuing together, that may be without much difficultie discouered out of Bede, to haue continued after Honorius also? But where euer that testimonie of his diuiding Parishes was first found, I doubt it was mis-vnderstood, through the various signification of Parochia. For in those ancient times, Parochia vsually denoted as well a Bishoprique, or Diocese, or bisceope scyre, as the Saxons called it, as a lesse Parish. That signification is very obuious in the old Councells of both Tongues (as it is also specially obserued by the learned Filesacus in his Paroecia) and in the moniments of this Kingdome. For it is related of King Cenwalch, that he diuided 
                        Beda Hist. Eccles. lib. 3. cap. 7. 
                     Prouinciam in duas Parochias, when he made a new Bishoprique at Winchester, that was taken out of the Diocese of Dorchester. And in the Councell of Hertford, held vnder Theodore Archbishop of Canterburie, one Canon is

                        ., Vt nullus Episcoporum Parochiam alterius inuadat sed contentus sit gubernatione creditae sibi plebis. So in Florence of Worcester, vnder the yeere D.C.LXXX. Merciorum Prouincia in quinque Parochias est diuisa, that is, into fiue Bishopriques. And the truth is, that it may be said properly enough, that Honorius was the

first vnder whom his Prouince was diuided into such Parochiae, or Bishopriques. that is, No other Bishopriques (except Canterburie, London, and Rochester) were in his Prouince vntill his time; those three being almost of one antiquitie. But vnder him, Byrinus was made first Bishop of the West-Saxons, and had his See or Bisceop setle (as they calld it) at Dorchester, and Foelix the Burgugnone was likewise ordaind first Bishop of the East-Angles at Dunwich. Which two Ordinations, in regard the like had not been in this Prouince of Canterburie from Augustines time till this Honorius, were perhaps the cause why it might be related, that Honorius primus Prouinciam suam in Parochias diuisit. Which, although it were to be conceiud of such Parishes as at this day wee call by that name, yet could not extend to all his Prouince. For not till long after his time, was Christianitie receiud in the Kingdome of Sussex, which was first conuerted by Wilfrid, first Bishop of Selsey, in the yeere D.C.LXXIX. Hitherto then, for aught can out of ancient Moniments be proued, no Limits Parochiall, in regard of the profits to be receiud from the Parishioners, and spent by this or that Minister only, were assigned. But the ancient course of a kind of communitie of all profits of the Diocese, with the Bishop and his Clergie, remaind still in vse. Neither was the interest of many Churches, it seems, as yet here in any Lay-founders.

But the Bishops, as I thinke, had both the interest and gouernance of the Churches built by the King, and tooke care for building new in their owne endowments, and hallowing old ones, that had been either prophaned since Christian Seruice vsed in them among the Britons, or formerly consecrated only to Heathenisme. So may you vnderstand that of Byrinus, first Bishop of Dorchester. Factis dedicatisque Ecclesijs multisque ad Dominum, pro eius labore, populis aduocatis, migrauit ad Dominum, as Bedes words are; in the Saxon of which it is exprest, that the Ciricean ƿorhte & gehalgode, that is, made Churches, and hallowed them.
                  
               
               
                  IV.
                  But afterward, when deuotion grew firmer, and most Lay men, of faire estate, desired the Countrey-residence of some Chaplains, that might be alwaies readie for Christian instruction among them, their Families, and adioyning Tenants; Oratories and Churches began to be built by them also: and being hallowed by the Bishops, were endowed with peculiar maintenance from the Founders, for the Incumbents that should there only reside. Which maintenance, with all other Ecclesiastique profits that came to the hands of euery such seuerall Incumbent (in regard▪ that now the Lay-founder had, according to the Territorie of his Demesnes, Tenancies, or neighbouring Possessions, made and assigned both the Limits within which

the holy Function was to be exercised, and appointed the persons that should repaire to the Church, and offer there, as also prouided a speciall Salarie for the performance) was afterward also restraind from that common Treasurie of the Diocese, and made the only reuenue, which became perpetually annext to the Church of that Clerk who receiued it. Neither was it wonder, that the Bishops should giue way to such restraint. for had they denied that to Lay founders, they had giuen no small cause also of restraining their deuotion. Euery man, questionlesse, would haue been the vnwillinger to haue specially endowd the Church, founded for the holy vse chiefely of him, his Familie, and Tenants, if withall he might not haue had the libertie to haue giuen his Incumbent, there resident, a speciall and seuerall maintenance; which could not haue been, had the former communitie of the Clergies reuenue still remained. Out of these Lay foundations chiefely, doubtlesse came those kind of Parishes, which at this day are in euery Diocese. their differences in quantitie being originally out of the difference of the seuerall Circuits of the Demesnes or Territories possessed by the Founders▪ And after such time as vpon Lay foundations, Churches had their profits so limited to their Incumbents, no doubt can be, but that the Bishops, in their Prebends, or Aduowsons of Parishes, both in Cities and in the

Countrey, formerly limited only in regard of the Ministers Function, restraind also the profits of euery of their seuerall Churches, to the Incumbents; that so a vniformitie might be receiued in that innouation of Parochiall right. At what time these Lay foundations began to be frequent, plainly enough appears not. But some mention is of them about the yeer D.CC. as you may see in

                     Bede, where he speaks of one Puch, a Saxon Noble man, that had built a Church, and entreated Iohn, Bishop of Hangulstad, to consecrate it; and the like also of one Addi. Alio item tempore, sayes hee, vocatus ad dedicandum Ecclesiam Comitis vocabulo Addi. Some such more, of about that time, may bee found. But about the yeere D.CCC. many Churches, founded by Lay men, are recorded to haue been appropriated to the Abbey of Crowland, as you see in the Charters of Confirmation made by Bertulph King of Mercland, and of others, to the same Abbey, reported by Ingulphus. Whence it may bee obserued, that by this time Lay foundations were grown verie common, and Parochiall Limits also of the Parishioners deuotions. And in a Councell held in D.CCC.XVI. vnder Wilfrid, Archbishop of Canterburie, wee find, Vbi Ecclesiae aedif

In that Synod it appears that any man might haue bequeathed his buriall to what Abbey best pleased him, and that the Abbot to whose Monasterie the bequest was made, should haue the Apparell of the dead, his Horse and his Cow for a Mortuarie, although he had before solemnly giuen all that he had to any other Abbot. whence may easily be coniectured that Monasteries were in chiefest reputation for Videsis c. 16. quaest. 1. c. 1

that course of paiment of a motuarie (which the Saxons,
                     
                        Vide Canuti Leg. cap. 13. I think, calld saƿlsceat) the same Synod affirmes, that Omne corpus sepultum habet in iure suo Vaccam & Equum & Vestimentum & Ornamentum sui Lecti; nec quicquam horum reddetur in alia debita, quia corpori eius tanquam vernacula debentur. and although the certain age of that Synod appears not, yet it was after such time as Parishes were limited in regard of the Parishioners repairing to one certain Church and giuing their deuotions there only. for in it also are these words: quicunque discesserit de sua Ecclesia & in alia Ecclesia sepultus fuerit &c. what can sua Ecclesia be but such a kind of Parish Church, as at this day is titled so? that is, one limited in regard of the Parishioners and their profits receiued from them. But, in that of Edgars ealden Minstre, it is plain that although Minstre specially denote a Monasterie, yet all other Parish Mother Churches are vnderstood by it. and indeed dyric and Minstre are frequent, as Synonomies in the Saxon moniments. But as the first part of his Law that giues all Tithes to the Mother Church of euery Parish, meant in them a Parochiall right to Incumbents, so also the second part, that permits a third portion of the Founders Tithes to be setled in a Church new built, wherto the right of Sepulture is annexed, makes a dispensation for a Parishioner that would build such a Church in his Bocland or land

possessed optimo iure, or as inheritance deriued from a Charter of feoffment. And howeuer that second part also of this Law, is iterated by King Knout, yet I doubt not but that such new erections within old Parishes bred also new diuisions which afterward became whole Parishes, and by conniuence of the time, took (for so much as was in the Territorie of that Bocland) the former Parochiall right that the elder and Mother church was possessed of. For, that right of Sepulture or hauing a legerstoƿ, was, and regularly is a Character of a Parish Church or Ecclesia, as it is commonly distinguished from Capella. and anciently if a quare impedit had been brought for a Church, whereas the defendant pretended it to be a Chappell only, the issue was not so much whether it were Church or Chappell, as whether it had Baptisterium or Sepulturam, or no. so it appears in a case of 
                        Trinit. Placit. 23. Hen. 3. rot. 15. in arce Londinensi. 23. Hen. 3. where William of Whitanston in his count against the Archbishop of Canterburie, expresses, Ecclesiam de Hey in Sussex to be of his aduowson, and the Archbishop pleads that what he calls a Church, non est Ecclesia, imo Capella pertinens ad matricem Ecclesiam de Terringes, ita quod non est ibi Baptisterium neque Sepultura imo omnes qui nascuntur ibidem baptizantur apud Terringes, & similiter omnes qui ibi moriuntur, sepeliuntur apud Terringes &c. and thence was it also that the whole Clergie of England put the inquirie of such an

issue among their grieuances, when in 21. Hen 3. they desired Otho the Popes Legat, among other freedoms, to get for them of the King, Quod

But also besides those originall Lay foundations, some Parishes haue had other beginnings since from alterations made in regard of the inconuenience of their former limits.

               THe Laws of this Kingdom for payment of Tithes, and the originall of Parochiall right to profits accruing within the

                  In that, something also is obseruable among the Ancients of this Kingdom of a kind of Tithing, related to haue been where Christianitie was not yet receiued. Some of them tell vs of Cedwalla King of the West-Saxons, that before his being made Christian (about the yeere DC.LXXXVI.) he tithed all his spoiles of Warre to the Deitie. So the Monk of Malmesburie. Arduum memoratu est, saith he, quantum etiam ante baptismum inseruiret pietati, vt omnes manubias, quas iure praedatorio in suos vsu

                        Sidon. Apollinaru lib. 8. Epist. 6. words, of them are. Praetereà priusquàm de continenti in patriam vela laxantes, hostico mordaces anchoras vado vellant, mos est remeaturis Demimum quenque captorum per aquales

Talibus se ligant votis, victimis soluunt: & per huiusmodi non tam sacrificia purgati quam sacrilegia polluti, religiosum putant caedis infaustae perpetratores, de capite captiuo magis exigere tormenta quam pretia. Neither, I think, is any other expresse mention of this their Tithing, among ancient moniments. and, for that their sacrificing to Neptune; indeed the Autor Apollinaris here mentions him not. but, it being done at Sea and per aquales (for so is the true reading, although some there read aequales poenas) you may wel coniecture it was to Neptune or to their supposed Deitie of the Sea. and thus the most learned and noble Monsieur Sauaron in his notes vpon Apollinaris, expresly also makes it a sacrifice to Neptune. and although it be true that among their gods we find none namd, that is denoted to answer to Neptune, yet, that some Deitie of the same nature, that is some great Sea god was in their superstitions, may be easily collected not only from this relation of their cruell deuotions, but also from their wondrous and accurat obseruation of the ebbs and flouds (called by them Ledons and Malins) which were the Videsis Ioseph.

the Sea was to them reputed a Deitie, as the Sunne and Moone also, before other Creaturers, in the ancient Theologie of the Gentiles. But for that of Cedwalla; let it be vpon Malmesburie credit, that he tithed his spoyles. Bede, who might better haue knowne it then Malmesburie could, relates no such thing of him. He sayes only, that when he conquerd the Isle of Wight, according to a vow that hee made to the Deitie, hee gaue for the Lords vse, the fourth part of the Isle (that is, CCC.

                  For the practice of payment among Christians, both Britons and Saxons; might wee beleeue the common tale of that Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterburie Prouince, his comming to Cometon in Oxfordshire, and doing a most strange miracle there, touching the establishing of the Doctrine of due payment of Tithes, wee should haue as certain and expresse

autoritie for the ancient practice of such payment, as any other Church in Christendome can produce. But as the tale is, you shall haue it, and then censure it. About the yeer (they say) DC. Augustine comming to preach at Cometon, the Priest of the place makes complaint to him, that the Lord of the Mannor hauing been often admonished by him, would yet pay him no Tithes. Augustine questioning the Lord about that default in deuotion; hee stoutly answered, That the tenth Sheaf doubtlesse was his that had interest in the nine, and therefore would pay none. Presently Augustine denounces him excommunicate, and turning to the Altar to say Masse, publiquely forbad, that any excommunicat person should be present at it, when suddenly, a dead Corps, that had been buried at the Church doore, arose (pardon me for relating it) and departed out of the limits of the Churchyard, standing still without, while the Masse continued. Which ended, Augustine comes to this liuing-dead, and charges him in the name of the Lord God to declare who hee was. Hee tells him, that in the time of the British State he was huius villae Patronus, and although he had been often vrged by the Doctrine of the Priest to pay his Tithes, yet he neuer could be brought to it; for which he died, he sayes, excommunicat, and was carried to Hell. Augustine desired to know where the Priest that excommunicated him, was

buried. this dead shewed him the place; where hee makes an inuocation of the dead Priest, and bids him arise also, because they wanted his help. The Priest rises. Augustine askes him, if he knew that other that was risen. he tells him, yes; but wishes he had neuer known him. for (saith hee) he was in all things euer aduerse to the Church, a detainer of his Tithes, and a great sinner to his death, and therefore I excommunicated him. But Augustine publiquely declares, that it was fit mercie should be vsed towards him, and that he had sufferd long in Hell for his offence (you must suppose, I thinke, the Autor meant Purgatorie) wherefore hee giues him absolution, and sends him to his graue, where hee fell againe into dust and ashes. Hee gone, the Priest new risen, tells, that his Corps had lien there aboue C.LXX. yeers; and Augustine would gladly haue had him continue vpon earth againe, for instruction of Soules, but could not thereto entreat him. So he also returns to his former lodging. The Lord of the Town standing by all this while, and trembling, was now demanded if hee would pay his Tithes; but he presently fell down at Augustines feet, weeping and confessing his offence; and receiuing pardon, became all his life time a follower of Augustines. Had this Legend truth in it, who could doubt, but that payment of Tithes was in practice in the Infancie of the British Church? The Priest that rose here from the

dead, liud (if he euer liud) about CCC.XXX. after Christ, and would not surely haue so taxed the Lord of this Mannor only, if the payment had not been vsually among other good Christians here, not taught only, but performed also. Neither need I admonish much of the autoritie of it. the whole course of it directs you how to smell out the originall. Beside the common Legend of our Saints, it is in some Volumes put alone, for a most obseruable Moniment. and I found it bound vp at the end of the Ms. life of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterburie, writen by Iohn de Grandisono. and it remains in the publique Librarie of Oxford. There also you haue it related in Ioannes Anglicus 
                     
                        Ms. part. 1. lib. 17. cap. 72. his Historia Aurea, and, in the Margine, are noted to it these words: Hoc miraculum videbitur illis incredibile qui credunt aliquid Deo esse impossibile. sed nulli dubium est quod nunquam Anglorum durae ceruices Christi iugo se submisissent nisi per magna miracula sibi diunitus ostensa. But let the truth be as it will, I doe not beleeue, that the fable can be found, nor any steps of it, aboue CCCC. yeer old at most. But, to leaue such testimonie, no doubt can be, but that some practice of payment was here vsed very anciently, which (beside the deuotion to be supposed in Christians, and the Doctrine of ancient Fathers, which, verie likely, wrought here as in other Western Churches) might be collected, by good probabilitie,

out of those Laws alone of the Saxon times which questionlesse were not without some effect, being so often renewd. Neither is the memorie of some vse of payment here, in these more elder times, omitted in the reliques of antiquitie. In the Ms. life

                      of the British Saint Cadoc, among some Laws of his Church of Lhancaruan, which seem to be attributed to his time (which falls about our Augustine or before) one is, Quicunque decimauerit, debet diuidere in tres partes. primam dabit Confessori, secundam Altari, tertiam orantibus pro eo. but the Autor of this whence we haue it, wrote not till after the Norman Conquest. And it is reported also of Eadbert Bishop of Lindisfarn or Holy Iland, that he was Eleemosynarum operatione (as 
                        Eccles. Hist. lib. 4. cap. 29. 
                     Bedes words are) insigni ita vt iuxta legem omnibus annis Decimam non solum quadrupedum, verum etiam frugum omnium & pomorum necnon & vestimentorum partem pauperibus daret. which words are almost repeated also by Turgot Prior of Durham,
                     
                        Ms. in Biblioth. Cotton. & apud V.C. Th. Allen. Oxon.
                      that wrote the storie of that Bishoprique. But here no custom of the place or common vse is noted, but only a speciall deuotion of Eadbert. and for that of iuxta legem; you must vnderstand it of Moses Law. and so is it exprest in the Saxon Copie of Bede, where I read that he did it aefter Moyses ae, and that is, according to the Law of Moses. Neither is the regard in those times had to a tenth (although not yeerly) to

to be paid as for a soules ransom, to the poor, after the death of euery Bishop out of his estate, to be here wholly neglected. Out of this regard may be inferd that therein also the Tenth was reputed as a sanctified part.
And wee learne it out of a Councell

And for the succeeding times of the Saxons; we may well coniecture a practice of payment out of King Knonts Epistle sent in M.XXXI. as he departed homeward from Rome, by Liuing Abbot of

                     Tanystok to Athelnoth and Alfrique, the two Archbishops by name, and to the rest of the Bishops & Baronage of England. he therein straitly charges them all, that according to the ancient Law they should take care that Tithes were duly paid among other Church reuenues, wherin if he found default at his cōming they should expect seuere punishment. the words were:

and the Monk that relates it, addes, 
                        nec dicto deterius fuit factum
                     . But what euer may be out of these testimonies concluded, it is noted among the Laws attributed to Edward the Confessor, that what through the coldnesse of deuotion, what through the neglect of demanding Tithes by the Clergie, that were otherwise

grown very rich in reall endowments, the practice of paiment of them was much diminished. Sed postea instinctu diaboli (are the words which follow immediatly what is before in the Chapter of Laws §. XIII.) 
                        multi Decimam detinuerunt, & Sacerdotes locupletes negligentes non curabant inire laborem ad per quirendas eas, eo quod sufficienter habebant suae necessaria vitae. Multis enim in locis modo sunt tres vel quatuor Ecclesiae vbi tunc temporis vna tantùm erat, & sic ceperunt minui·
                      but we are not sure that this addition to the Law is as ancient as the Confessor. I think it indeed rather of somewhat later time. yet doubtlesse the generall practice of paiment according to those ancient Laws, howeuer it might be in elder times, was about the Norman Conquest, much discontinued, which may be specially obserued out of that book of Domesday (the originall Copie whereof yet remains in the Receipt of the Exchequer) in which the Possessions and Reuenues both of the Clergie and Laitie were accounted and valued, by the othes of Enquests taken in euery Countie vpon commission, and so returned thither about the end of the Conquerors raign. There, frequently enough, Churches are mentioned by the words of Ibi Ecclesia & Presbyter, or such like; and how many Carues or Hides of land, how many villans, and other endowments and reuenues belongs to them, are reckond, with their values.

But very rarely any Tithes among those Church reuenues are there found. if none at all had been namd, it might haue been thought that they had been omitted as a more sacred profit, then was fit to be taxed in such a Description. But some, although very few, occurre in it. as vnder Terra Osberni Episcopi in Boseham in Sussex, you may there find that Decimam Ecclesiae Clerici tenent, & valet XLs. where the lest value of the Mannor is made at XLli. per annum. in Hampshire vnder Terra Osberni Episcopi, you read Ecclesia S. Michaelis de Monte tenet de Rege in Basingestoches Hundred, vnam Ecclesiam cum 1. hida & Decimam de Manerio Basingestoches. Ibi est Presbyter. So in the same Shire vnder Terra Regis; Ipse Rex tenet Wallope &c. ibi Ecclesia; cui pertinent vna hida & medietas Decimae Manerij & totum

Ibi est adhuc Ecclesiola ad quam pertinent VIII. acrae de Decima. for these VIII. acres of Tithes, see before in the Chapter of Laws §. IX.X. and XI. And in the same Shire also among the Abbot of Lire's possessions, the Tithe of Cladford is reckond, as also of Adrintone. and also the Tithes of Stanham are possessed there by one Richerius Parson of the Church of Stanham. and vnder Terra Canonicorum de Tuinham, is found, Ad hanc Ecclesiam pertinet tota decima de Twinham, & tertia pars Decimarum de Holchest. and
                     
in the Isle of Wight there, VI. Churches, belonging to the Abbey of Lire, Decimas habent de omnibus redditibus Regis. So in Bedfordshire the Church of S. Marie de Cormelijs, hath diuers Tithes among its reuenues. But the mention of Tithes where Churches are neuerthelesse spoken of, is but very seldome through that whole Description. and indeed in certain Counties as Somerset, Deuon, Cornwall, and some few others, you shal rarely haue a Parish Church noted, but in others, very often Churches are, but very few examples of their hauing Tithes. sometimes also grants of Tithes by Lay owners are there mentiond, out of the vse of which it may be well thought that the moities or third parts of tithes belonging to this or that Church, had their beginnings. But thereof more particularly in the next Chapter, where we speak of arbitrarie Consecrations. And in most Appropriations of Parish Churches made in the Saxon times (the anciēt course being to grant, in appropriating, Ecclesiam cum Decimis) no mention is of Decimae, but other possessions of the churches granted are most particularly inserted in the instruments; of which some examples are published in Ingulphus Abbot of Crowland, and very many occurre in Chartularies of old Monasteries.

Saltem Decimas (as the words are) quod Legis & Prouinciae consuetudo exigebat, Ecclesiae requisiuit, sed omnibus negatis rubore simul & dolore confusus discessit. here the practice of payment is noted by Prouinciae consuetudo. and about the same time the fashion about Abingdon was to pay the Tithes to the Abbey (due either as it was an ealder Minstre by K. Edgars Law; or as they had been consecrated; whereof more in the next Chapter) by whole Hides and Acres.

the Parochiall Tithes were most knowne reuenue of euery Church, with which agrees the ancient and present forme of the Count, in a Writ of Right of Aduowson of a Parish Church, wherein the Esplees are chiefely laid in Tithes, because the Aduowson of the whole Tithes, is no other then the Aduowson of the Church, as Iudge Stoner

Hen. 8. which were reputed due vpon the generall presumption of euery Defuncts negligence in payment of his Personall Tithes. The Mortuarie was therefore (by the Canons) to bee presented with the body at the Buriall, as a satisfaction of omission, and negligence in paying to the Church

Ed. 3. to an Action of Trespas brought by Thomas of Goustill against the Parson of Whitwell, for the taking of a Horse; in which the defendant pleades, that it was the Horse of one I. Leyer his Parishioner that died, Et que le dit Chiual ensemblement oue autres choses fust mesnes & present al Esglise come en nosme de Mortuarie deuant le corps mesme le iour &c. & il come Parson les prist & resceut auxi come custome de la terre & de Seint Esglise est &c. These shew plainly the receiued and acknowledged

Parochiall right, in the practice of those times, which hath to this day continued. neither is it at all necessarie to adde more for the vniforme continuance of it. Sauing only, that where any Statute hath made a discharge, or Prescription or Custome hath setled a Modus Decimandi or certain quantitie payable, though neuer so little, for the Tithe, there, by the Laws of the Kingdome, the owner is not bound to pay other Tithe, then the Statute or Custome or Prescription binds him to. Which yet must be so vnderstood in the case of Lay men, that Custome or Prescription founded in their possessions as Lay, cannot wholly discharge the Tithe, or be de non Decimando, but may well be de modo only; otherwise is it in the case of spiritual persons, that may by the common Law be by Prescription wholly, discharged and prescribe de non Decimando. And this is regularly cleer Law. But at what time this Parochiall and common right became first setled with vs in practice, is not so cleerly known. and though those Decretals, before cited, suppose it a thing of custom here in Henry the II. his time, yet if credit might be giuen to the report of those English Monks, which (as wee haue before related) referd the ordaining of Parochiall right in Tithes to the Generall Councell of Lions, held vnder Gregorie the tenth, then wee might conclude the right of it no ancienter then about the beginning of our Edward the first. But whateuer

they meant, it is certaine, that some, both Synodall and secular Lawes of this Kingdome, had, before that time, ordained this right. Yet indeed it will be found, that the Practice of it here (as also in other Countries) was not setled till some M.CC. yeers after Christ, or, at lest, was, for many yeers before, & some after, discontinued. Which may partly be collected out of that Decretall of Pope Innocent the third, sent into this Kingdome, and dated in the Lateran; which is before at large in the Chapter of Laws, §. XXIII. For howeuer the recitals are in those of Alexander the third (the one speaking of Generalis institutio for Parochiall payment, which, as it may denote common custome, so also may be vnderstood for some Law of the Kingdome, as that of Edgars, Knouts, the Confessors, or some other before related; the other, of Consueuerint Ecclesijs quibus debentur, which doth not of necessitie include a generall practice of Parochiall payment, but may as well denote the dutie that comes from arbitrarie Consecrations; of which, in the next Chapter) it is most certain, that before about the yeer M.CC. after Christ, that is, about the time of King Iohn, it was most commonly practised by the Laitie, to make arbitrarie Consecrations of the Tithes of their possessions to what Monasterie or Church they would, sometimes giuing halfe, sometimes a third part, and at their pleasure all, in perpetuall

right, or otherwise, according to the nature of those Consecrations in other Countries; of which, enough is before related. Neither doth expresse testimonie hereof want in that Decretall of Innocent the third, made against these kind of arbitrarie Consecrations. Multi (saith hee) in Diocesi tua (that is the Prouince of Canterburie) Decimas suas pro sua distribuunt voluntate. Neither may you vnderstand it, as if it had bin done by the waiward opposition of some only against the receiud and allowd Laws of the Kingdome. For notwithstanding all those Ordinances, both Secular and Synodall, anciently here made for due payment, it is cleer, that in the time before about that Innocent, it was not only vsuall, in fact, for Lay men to conuey the right of their Tithes, as Rents-charge, or the like, to what Church or Monasterie they made choice of, but by the course and practice of the Law also of that time (both Common and Canon, as it was here in vse) such conueyances were cleerly good, and what was through them so acquired, was continually, and is to this day (except some particulars, which either the Popes autoritie of later time, or new Cōpositions or Grants, or the like, haue altered) enioyed by the Churches, that, yet remaining, had portions so anciently giuen them, or by the King or his Grantees of impropriated Tithes; very many of which, had their chiefe originall from those arbitrarie Consecrations

(which you may well call Appropriations of Tithes) and not from the appropriating only of Parish Churches, as some out of grosse ignorance, with too much confidence, deliuer. But thereof you may see more in the examples of the next Chapter. where, for most apparant proofe of the practice of arbitrarie Consecrations in those times, Moniments enough are collected. This arbitrarie disposition, vsed by the Laitie as well de iure (as the Positiue Law, then receiued and practiced, was) as de facto, is that which Wicclef rememberd in his complaint to the King and Parlament vnder Richard the second. His words are: A Lord God, 
                     
                        Why is this reason, or is this reason.
                      
                     where this be reason, to constrain the poor people to find a worldly Priest, sometime vnable both of life and cunning, in pompe and pride, couetise and enuie, glottonie, drunkennesse and lecherie, in simonie and heresie, with fat Horse, and iolly and gay Saddles and Bridles, ringing by the way, and himselfe in costly Clothes and Pelure, and to suffer their wiues and children, and their poor neighbours, perish for hunger, thirst, and cold, and other mischiefes of the world. A Lord Iesu Christ, sith within few yeeres, men payed their Tithes and Offerings at their own will free to good men, and able to great worship of God, to profit and fairenesse of holy Church fighting in earth. 
                     
                        Why is it lawfull.
                      
                     Where it were lawfull and needfull, that a worldly Priest should destroy this holy and approued custome, constraining men to leaue

this freedome, turning Tithes and Offerings into wicked vses. But what hee calls a few yeers, will fall out to be about CC. for hee wrote about the yeer M.CCC.XC. With him well agrees some passages in our Yeere-bookes of the times before him. As in 7. Ed. 3. fol. 5. a. Parning truly affirmes, that in auncien temps deuant vn Constitution de nouelle fait per le Pape, vn Patron d'un Esglise puit granter Dismes, deins mesme le Paroche a vn altre Paroche. And Herle there in his answer seemes to admit it cleere. So also (touching others as well as Patrons) Lodlow, Iudge of Assise in 44. Ed. 3. fol. 5. b. En auncien temps chescun home purroit graunter les Dismes de sa terre a quel Esglise il voudroit. Quod verum est, sayes Iudge Brooke, in abridging the case. But what new Constitution of the Pope is meant there by Parning? some later Vide 10. Hen. 7. fo

                      Books tells vs, that from the Councell of Lateran the first alteration of that course of arbitrarie disposition came. But plainely, no Councell of Lateran hath any Canon that alterd the Law in it, except that vnder Alexander the third, before spoken of in the end of the sixt Chapter, may haue place here: which, indeed, the Canonists will not endure, vnlesse you restraine it only to ancient Feudall Tithes. And they suppose, euerie man might haue arbitrarily conueyed, before that Councell, his Feudall Tithes to what Church he would. And so expressely sayes our

                     
                        Tit de locat & conducto
                              •

                     Lindwood. Ante illud Concilium benè potuerunt Laici Decimas in feudum retinere & eas alteri Ecclesiae vel Monasterio dare; non tamen post tempus dicti Concilij. But if those which with vs talk here of the Councell of Lateran, meane that vnder Alexvnder the third, and apply it generally to arbitrarie Consecrations of new Tithes, not feudall, I doubt they are much neerer the true meaning of that Councell then any of the Canonists. especially while they speake of this Kingdome. for arbitrarie Consecrations before about the time of that Councell are found here infinite, as presently shall be shewd. But of ancient feudall Tithes (howeuer they were common in other States) scarce any mention at all or tast is with vs. but thereof more in the XIII. Chapter. And, it may be, that when, from the Canonists, some of our Lawiers had learned that feudall Tithes might haue been conueied before that Councell arbitrarily by the owner; and saw withall that scarce any signe was of feupall Tithes in this Kingdom, yet an abundance of old arbitrarie Consecrations, the vse whereof ceased about the time of the Councell; in the words of it no regard or mention being had of feudall but only Tithes in generall; they concluded (who sees enough why they might not?) that before that Councell euery man might haue arbitrarily disposed of his tithes. that is such tithes as were not formerly setled by any ciuill Title.

But if this will not be allowd for the Law of change of those arbitarie conueiances; why may it not first be that Parning by his Constitution de nouelle fait per le Pape, meant that 
                        Quam vide supr. cap. 8. §. 23. of Pope Innocent the third, sent to the Archbishop of Canterburie in King Iohns time (and perhaps it was soon after receiud into the Prouince of York either by imitation or through the power Legatin, which the Archbishop of Canterburie commonly exercised through the whole Kingdome) to command a Parochiall payment? For also by the name of a Constitution newly made by the Pope, some such thing rather then a Canon of a generall Councell, is perhaps denoted. And then why might it not happen that the Decretal of Innocent the third, bearing date in the Church of Lateran should be thence denominated, and that afterward those which truly vnderstanding it, called it therefore a Lateran Constitution, gaue cause of mistaking to others that took it for a Constitution of a generall Councell of Lateran? especially too because it was about the time of the generall Councell of Lateran (held vnder the same Pope that sent it) of which more notice hath been taken in our Law then of any other of that name. and indeed he that affirms that before the Councell of Lateran Lay owners might haue disposed their Tithes, cuicunque Ecclesiae secundum meliorem deuotionem, as Dyers words are, speaks true enough, if his words may receiue

this easie interpretation. that is, that till about that Councell of Lateran they might haue done so; not that the Councell vnder Pope Innocent restraind it, but that either the next Councell of Lateran before, that is vnder Alexand. the III. or the Pope by a Constitution, receiued here from Rome and dated in the Church of Lateran, about the time of that Councel of the yeer M.CC.XV. ordaind the contrarie. so that in this last way the name of the Councell may be a note only of the time about which it was restraind, not of the autoritie whence it was forbidden. Perhaps those Canons of Pluralities, of Exemptions, of the three orders, and some such more which we receiud from that Councell vnder Innocent, were brought into England at once with this Decretall Epistle; and if so, then also it was no more strange to haue the Decretall afterward titled by the name of a Cōstitution of the Lateran Councell, then it happend in the denomination of the Statuts of Aide de Roy and Voucher, made in 4. Ed. 1. euery of which are stiled by the name of Statutum de Bigamis. yet only one Law de Bigamis receiud out of the generall Councell of Lions, is among those Statuts; and that is euen as much a stranger to the rest of the Constitutions bearing the same name with it, as Pope Innocents Decretall was to the whole Councell of Lateran. Howeuer, it is most cleer (let froward ignorance as it can continue to oppose the assertion)

that for CC. yeers at lest before about the time of the Councell of Lateran, held vnder the same Pope, arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes with vs were frequent, and practiced aswell of positiue right (if wee may take that for right, in things subiect to human disposition, which generall consent of the state allowd; as no man that knows what makes a positiue right, can denie) as of fact; which because they are best conceiud of by the particular testimonies and precedents of them, in the following Chapter manie shall be transcribed; that are all (except one or two in the Prouince of Yorke; neither is it likely that in euery place here, and by euery man the intent of that Constitution was suddenly obserued, and perhaps also it was not so soon alterd in York Prouince as in this of Canterbury, in regard that the Decretall was sent only to Canterburie Prouince) of the time before that Decretall and taken out of the most choice and authentique moniments, that may afford help to the disquisition of this point so little, so not at all vulgarly or indeed any where publiquely discouered.

The originall moniments of those elder ages afford vs plentie of thē. And in regard of the easier connexion and more compendious way of deliuerie, we shall rather seuerally follow the singular courses of euery of the Chartularies or other moniments, which tell vs of those kind

of consecrated Tithes, then dispose together euery arbitrarie Consecration according to the order of time. The seuerall Titles of books whence we haue them shall chiefly direct in the generall order. but neither shall the particular time, of euery of these selected examples of Consecration, be omitted.

In it, in the time of K. William the second and Rainald Abbot, occurres; that Viuente praedicto Rainaldo Abbate, trium Decimationum, Ecclesiae huic facta est vna ab Herberto de villa sua Lakine, appellata Henrici de Ferrarijs

in hoc expenduntur. Tertia à Rotberto cuius erat cognomen Marmiun, & à filio ipsius Helto de villa sua Henreda, frugum omnium suae propriae lucrationis. Sed & post illos à Radulfo cognomento Rosel idem concessum.
                     And then follows Rosel's Charter to that purpose:
                     Ego Radulphus agnomento Rosellus concedo volo atque praecipio seruientibus meis vt segetes meas de Hen
                              •

And this Tithe was in the sole disposition of the Almosner of the Abbey.
Out of IV. Hides also lying in the same Henred, a consecration of the Tithe had been made before in the time of the Danish gouernment, by a Dane, and is thus there reported. Tempore Danorum, fuit quidam eorum qui possidens VII. hidas in Henreda, propter vicinitatem Abbendoniae & amorem S. Mariae Virginis & aliorum Sanctorum qui mihi digniter coluntur, dedit Decimam de Dominio eiusdem terrae Ecclesiae S. Mariae Abbendonensi in eleëmosynam pauperum hoc est de IIII. hydis; quam terram Helto Marmiun Deo & Sancto Stephano Cadomi dedit. Ecclesiae verò Abbendonensi Decima de Dominio praedicto in aeuum permansit.
Then follows a Charter of Henrie the first, wherein all the grants of Lands, Churches and Tithes made or thence after to be

made by Alberique de Ver and Beatrix his wife, their sonne Alberique and his brothers, or by their Tenants to the Monasterie of Colme in Essex (which was a member or as a Cell of Abbingdon, and erected by Alberique their▪ father) are confirmed; and in them two parts of the Tithe de omnibus rebus in the Mannors of Hethingham, Belcheam, Laureham, Aldeham, Duurecurt, Bonecleide, and Rodinges, and half of the Tithe of Walde and Wadane, are recited to haue been conueied to the same Monasterie, Et dimidia Decima Deimiblanc de Cola, & Tertia pars Decimae Ranulfi magni. this is dated XI. Hen. 1. at Reding, that is M.C.XI. And Faritius Abbot of Abingdon (as it is further rememberd) at Colme solemnly receiued inuestiture or seisin of euery of those and other possessions so granted by the hand of Picot Sewer to Alberique de Ver, with the testimonie of his wife, children, and many of his Tenants. And the Patent of Henrie the first is there extant, wherein tota Decima de venatione quae capta fuerit in Fo
                           •
                         esta de Windesore, is granted to the Abbey, which was after confirmed by Henrie the second, Richard the first and others. In the same Chartularie about the beginning of the same Henry the Tithes of Bulhey of Cildestun are giuen to the Abbey by William of Sulaham; in Hanney by Osbern and Turold; of Offington by the Tenants there; of Wekenfield by William of Wecenfield; of Eton by Roger

Fitz-Alured. and diuers such are related.
and the words of the most obseruable passages touching them shall be here infered. Anno V. regni Henrici Regis intrante (saies the book) Willielmus de Sulaham dedit Deo & Sanctae Mariae & Abbati Faritio & Monachis in Abbendona Decimam villae suae quae Bulhea vocatur. die videlicet Assumptionis eiusdem S. Mariae. Eodem etiam die confirmauit donum de alia decima quam anteà dederat de villa Cildestuna quae ad haereditatem Leodselinae priuignae suae pertinebat, ipsâ puellâ coram Monachis concedente donum. & cum ipso Willielmo & cum matre suâ super Altare idem imposuit, coram his testibus; Abbate praedicto & omni conuentu, Iohanne fratre coniugis eiusdem Willielmi, Humfrido eiusdem Milite, Hugone Conred. But that of Turold is thus exprest. Similitèr Turoldus de eadem Villa (that is, Hanney) dedit Deo & Sanctae Mariae de Abbendona coram Faritio Abbate & omni conuentu, in Capitulo, Decimam omnium suarum possessionum, porcellorum scilicet agnorum, vellerum. sed Decimam Carucae suae tantummodò ita discreuit, vt duas istius decimationis partes huic loco, tertiam verò partem Presbytero sibi seruienti concederet; hoc idem concedente & confirmante vxore sua Hugulinâ & filio suo Willielmo. & hanc donationem donauit anno V. Henrici Regis.
                     
Here specially you see as well arbitrarie diuision as consecration of the Tithe by the owners grant.
And for the example of the Tithes of Offington, the words of it are most obseruable also. Eodem anno (sayes the Monke that wrote it) cum venisset Abbas Faritius in villam suam Offentunam vt opus Ecclesiae quod ibi lapideum à fundamento inchoauerat ad perfectum determinaret, congregauerunt se homines sui ex eadem villa & obtulerunt communi deuotione & concessione Decimam suam totius villae eiusdem, S. Mariae & ipsi Abbati & loco Abbendoniae ab illo in reliquum tempus. Vt videlicet Abbas de suo proprio Ecclesiam eiusdem alacriùs construendo perficeret & ipsi mererentur in fraternitate loci annumerari. Hanc expetitionem cum Abbas audisset, inquisiuit vtrum Ecclesiae eiusdem villae antiquitùs Decima ab illis hominibus daretur; nolens scilicet eam sua rectitudine minuere pro alicuius donatione sibi suoque loco oblata. dictumque est, hoc esse moris villae vt a singula virgata Ecclesiae illi XXIIII. Garbae pro Decima numeratae donarentur. Quod sciens Abbas, statuit ante ipsos homines vt, sicuti ipsimet voluerant & optulerant, reciperet eorum Decimam, ea determinatione assignatâ inter ipsum Abbatem & Ecclesiam eiusdem villae, scilicet, vt tempore colligendarum Decimationum Abbas ipse mitteret Offentonam quem

vellet de suis, & ipse reciperet à fingulis, secundum singulorum possessionem, rectam Decimationem, & post illam totam collectam, de singula virgata illius villae tot manipulos Presbytero illius Ecclesiae tribueret quot superiùs diximus ei deberi. reliqua verò Decimationis Abbati seruaret.
Here plainly, no Tithe was parochially paid before this Graunt, but only XXIV. Sheaues of euery Yard Land; which was now diminished also by the consecration of the true Tithe to the Abbey. Then Willielmus de Wecenfeld Dedit suam Decimam ex omni sua pecunia S. Mariae & Monachis in Abbendon de tribus videlicet Hidis in Wecenfeild, & duabus de Boxore, excepta vna acra quae Ecclesiae de Boxore, adiacet. This was in 7. Hen. 2. And in the relation of the Tithes of Eaton, granted to the Abbey by Roger Fitz-Alured, it is added, Et promisit quod cum Osmundo & alijs suis hominibus de illa villa faceret vt & ipsi de suo tenore similitèr Decimam Ecclesiae huic concederent. So in 9. Hen. 1. Aldred & Luured homines Ecclesia de Waliford dederunt Monachis huius Ecclesiae Decimas de omnibus videlicet suis pecoribus, & de agrorum suorum cultura, in capitulo coram toto contentu. And in the same yeer, one Ralfe gaue them the Tithe of his Farme or Manor of Bradendene, and assured them, he would entreat Robert de Insula, his Lord of whom hee held Bradendene, Quatenus illius permissione & concessu

suo hoc confirmaret, vt haec Ecclesia ipsius Decima donatione firmiùs in posterum potiretur. The like gift occurres there, made by Hugh Fitz-Wichtgar in 10. Hen. 1. of the Tithes of Bennaham. And about the same time, Gilbert Basset gaue for euer to the Abbey, with his sonne Robert entring there into Religion, the Tithe of his Land in Waneting, to be employed ad vsum pauperum. Not long after, Hugo Dispensator Regis (it seems, Treasurer of the Household) granted to the Abbey, Suam Decimationem de omni pecunia tam de mobilibus rebus quam immobilibus de Manerio Spesholt quod de Ecclesia tenebat, sua coniuge Helewisa fauente, coram his testibus; Poidras suo homine, & Anschitillo suo praeposito de praedicta villa, & multis alijs. The like did Ralfe the Abbots Chamberlain grant out of two Hides in Steringford. So one Iocelin and his sonne Randoll granted to the Abbey two parts of all kind of Tithes in possessione quadam quae Graua dicitur. And one Norman, when his sonne Eudo there took habit of Religion, consecrated with him Decimam Dominij sui de Winterburne, quam cui placeret Ecclesiae liberè donare poterat. quae sic concessa sub manus sacristae redacta est. And among other possessions of the Abbot and Couent, confirmd by the Bull of Pope Eugenius the third, in the yeere M.C.LII. (that is, in XVII. of King Stephen) these Tithes granted, are particularly reckoned in it, as part of what

they did in praesentiarum iustè & canonice possidere. so are the words of the Bull. Neither to other purpose are the words of the Bishops of Salisburie, Ordinaries of the Diocese, in their generall confirmations of Churches and Tithes to the Abbey. These confirmations of theirs came diuers yeers after the Grants made by the owners, and are at large extant in the Chartularies of the Monasterie. The first that made any, was Hubert, who was consecrated Bishop in 1. Rich. 1. that is, M.C.LXXXIX. In the time of Henry the second, through the procurement of Richard Sacristein of the Abbey, one Giralin de Curzun graunted to the Abbey, Decimam XXX. acrarum de Westlakinge quam parentes sui priùs concesserant & ipse Altari sanctae Mariae concessit, addens de Porcellis siue Agnellis aut Caseis aut rebus alijs quae Decimari solent, Decimam, quam priores sui minimè dederant. Hanc verò donationem super Altare S. Mariae deuotus obtulit; trium tantum acrarum Decimâ de XXX. Ecclesiae de Waneting reseruatâ. Then, for Tithes in Chiltune; it is there reported, that in 2. Hen. 2. Nicholas Fitz-Turold gaue them to that Monasterie. his whole Charter is recorded, and so take it here for that part transcribed. Notum sit praesentibus & futuris testimonio huius scripti sigillo meo signati, quod ego Nicholaus filius Turoldi de Estuna pro salute animae meae parentumque meorum, & pro eo quod licitum mihi esset

ab Ecclesia de Abbendona coemiterium habere capellae meae de Winterburna, concessi firmiter & finaliter dedi praedictae Ecclesiae Abbendonensi singulis annis imperpetuum habendas Decimas terrae meae quam in Dominio meo teneo in villa Chiltune. In blado scilicet ad ostium Grangiae meae suscipiendo & in Caseis & in Velleribus & Agnis & Porcellis, & in omnibus quae Decimari solent. And at the time of the Grant, it was by the Abbot Ingulph assigned to the vse of the poor and strangers, that is, to the Almosnerie, as indeed most other of their consecrated Tithes were: Which is yet to bee seen in the accompts of the reuenues of euery Office of the house.

                  The Abbey being founded in 29. Hen. 1. that is, in M.C.XXIX. by Robert d'Oily High Constable of England; in the Charter of the Foundation are giuen to it the Tithes of the Founders Mills, that were neere the Castle of Oxford, & Decimatio Nicholai de Stodeham quam Fromundus (a Chaplain mentiond in the Charter) tenebat. and that is iterated often in other Charters to the same Monasterie. And after in the same Chartularie is a Catalogue of diuers Portions of Tithes belonging to the Abbey, and as issuing out of the Demesnes of such as had encreased the reuenues of it with endowments

of Tithes newly granted. nor are they expressed with any reference to this or that Parish, but only to the Demesnes and names of the Donors. And then comes a confirmation of Richard Bishop of Lincolne (within that Diocese,
                        An. D
                              •
                           . 1250. 
                     Oxfordshire was, till the later institution of a Bishoprique in Oxford) wherein, among the ancient possessions of the Abbey, enioyed through their hauing Saint Georges Church in the Castle by d'Oile's gift, two parts of the Tithes of all things quae Decimari solent, in dominico horum Maneriorum, videlicet, Bercencestre, Erdinton, &c. are confirmed to it. Neither is the number of those Mannors there named, vnder fortie. Which way is it likely, that the Church of S. George came to two parts of the Tithes of so many Mannors, if not by consecration of the owners? And indeed afterward is a transcript of a Charter of Robert d'Oily's (that was aboue C.XX. yeeres before the Bishops confirmation) to the Abbey, wherein he giues three Hides in Walton and Terram de Twenti acre & Decimam earundem terrarum, & pratum quod vocatur Brunmannes Mead, cum Decima eiusdem prati (where note, the Land and the Tithe of the same Land is giuen, which could be but a discharge of Tithes in the Abbey) & cum Decima de Northam, Wiueleya, & Lincha, & omnium terrarum & pratorum & aliarum rerum Decimabilium quae sunt inter Castellum Oxoniae, & 
                     Hin
                           •
                        sey. Heunteseyam aut Botleiam scilicet in

Comitatu Oxoniae. And then Duas partes Decimae, de omni re quae Decimari solet, de omnibus dominicis vtriusque honoris qui adiacent Castello Oxenefordiae, videlicet de Hokenorton, Swerefordia, Bereford, Wiginton, &c. with a recital of aboue fortie Townes and Mannors, which are also in that confirmation long after made by the Bishop. In the same Book, Richard of Dodeford giues them in perpetuall right the Tithes de assarto bosci mei de Hecholthe cum assartatur & excultus fuerit, siue ego siue alius per me illum assartauerit & excoluerit. This seemes to be of about King Iohns time. And one Hugh de Croftes grants them Decimas dominij mei de Wauretun de omnibus rebus quae Decimari possunt & debent, tenendas de Priore & Monachis de Tedford imperpetuum, sicut cartae vtriusque Monasterij inter eos factae testantur. And this was in 3. Rich. 1. And a pension was yeerely payable for them to the Prior of Thetford by that clause of tenendas, as appears in the confirmation made of the same Charter by William Bishop of Hereford. You must know, that the ancestors of Croftes had formerly giuen those Tithes to the Priorie of Thetford, as is remembred there also.

                  In a Fine there of 23. Hen. 3. between Peter of

                     Brus demandant, and Iohn Prior of Gisburne tenant, it appears, that when Robert de Brus, ancestor of Peter, vnder King Stephen, founded the Monasterie; he by grant endowd it, among other possessions, with the Tithe of his demesnes of Lithun. And in another of 26. Hen. 3. the Concord hath these words in it, Et similiter idem Petrus concessit pro se & haeredibus suis, quod idem Prior & successores sui habeant in Parochijs suis Decimam venationis suae & haeredum suorum; & foenorum suorum vbicunque foenum falcabitur praeterquam in locis subscriptis, scilicet in Parco sub Castro de Daneby & in IV. Laundis in Foresta de Daneby, scilicet in Launda de Souresby, Eskebriggethwoyt, Karlethwoyt, & in Launda sub Threlkeld, & in Haya de Skelton clausa ex aquilonali parte de Routheline, & in paruo Parco circa Castrum de Skelton in quibus locis nullas Decimas foeni habebunt. That of the Tithe of Venison, taken within the Parishes of the Priorie, was confirmed in another Fine of 30. Hen. 3. leuied before the Iustices of Eire in Yorkeshire; and therein also was further added, Concesst etiam idem Petrus pro se & haeredibus suis, quod ipsi de caetero reddent singulis annis praedicto Priori & successoribus suis & Ecclesiae suae praedictae Decimas Molendinorum suorum in Parochijs suis existentium imperpetuum. So that if the Mills were in Lease, the Tenth of the rent was payable; if in the hands of the grantor, or his heires, the

Tenth of the multure. and for true payment, the Millers were, by the concord of this Fine, bound to doe fealtie to the Prior and his successors. But I haue not seen an example of such disposition of Tithes of so late time. few or none else (I thinke) exceed the yeer of that Constitution of Lateran before spoken of. and remember that this is of York Prouince, in which perhaps the Decretall sent to Canterburie had not such effect till somwhat after, as is before touched.

                  Henrie the first giues to the Monks there diuers Churches with Tithes, 
                     Et dimidiam Decimam meam de Tarentford in annona tantum, & totam Decimam meam de Strodes, & totam decimam meam de Chealches, & hoc facio pro anima Patris mei & Matris meae & pro anima mea & vxoris meae, T. Eudone dapifero & Haymone dapifero apud Rouecestriam. Other Tithes of whole Mannors he gaue also to them, Et decimam Hae n. captae Regis sunt. Prarogat. Reg. cap. 11. &c.
                         Balenarum quae captae fuerint in Episcopatu Roffensi.
                     And about the same time Ralf Archbishop of Canterburie by Charter gaue them 
                     Totam Decimam de meo Dominico & omnes Decimas omniū villa norum qui habent terram in Dune, necnon & aliorum omnium, quorum decimae meo tempore ad quisitae sunt vel quocun

                     Many other Charters are in it to like purpose, as:

                     That d' Aubigny was Earle of Chichester or Sussex or Arundel (for all these titles he vsed) and diuers Confirmations were afterward by his Successors, of this Grant. and K. Henrie the first also confirmed this of the first William. and the Prior and Couent not long after made a Lease of that their Tithe in Bilsintune to one Gilebert de Perieres for IX. yeers, reseruing half a Mark rent payable at Easter. and this was confirmed by the Archbishop of Canterburie.
                  
                  
                     Roger Bigot Earle of Norfolk vnder Richard the first, and William his yonger sonne, had giuen diuers reuenues to the Priorie, and among them occur the Church of Waltune, and then by it selfe tota Decimae villae Waltune de omni re & tota

Decima molendinorum ad eandem villam pertinentium. this is related in the confirmation of Hugh Bigot Earle of Norfolk and sonne to Roger. and some other Churches were granted, but no Tithes mentioned with them. and afterward the first Charter of Rogers grant is in the same Volumè at large. The Tithes of Buggeley were giuen to the Priorie by the Ancestors of Osbert de Cappaualle, and charged with three shillings yeerly rent, paiable to the Monks of Colchester.
this instrument there remaining shews it. Notum sit omnibus (as the words are) quod ego Osbertus de Cappaualle & Adeliza vxor mea, & Humfridus priuignus meus & haeres patris sui, accepta societate Roffensium Monachorum pro amore Dei & Sancti Andreae, & salute animae nostrae, & omnium parentum nostrorum, concessimus eis omnem Decimam de Bugeleia, sicut eam antecessores nostri in eleëmosynam dederunt, firmitèr & stabilitèr, & quietè perpetuò tenendam, reddituris inde annuatim Monachis de Colecestra tres solidos quamdiù eandem tenent & habere poterunt. & hanc concessionem nostram praesenti sigillo confirmauimus &c. this was afterward confirmd by Philip of Leiburn and his wife Anne, and Robert of Leiburn Tenants of Buggeley.
                  
                  The Tithe of Gedding was thus granted by the Ancestors of Payn Shrife of Surrey. Notum sit

                  In 8. Hen. 1. halfe the Tithe of Halegele was giuen to them by Henrie de Port, the other halfe being before conueid to them—Decimam totam de Halegele, de qua (so speaks the Charter) praedictus Sanctus (that is S. Andrew) dimidiam partem habuerat, caeteram verò pro amore Radulphi Episcopi, vt praedictum est, supra taxato tempore donaui.

                   it seems that the Parson of Culinges by the Patrons will herein declared, was to haue the Tithe of Westbroke in kind, and pay half a mark for it yeerly to the Priorie.

                     And William Hachet confirms the moitie of the Tithes of his demesnes in Hainwold (which his ancestors had granted to the Priorie) to hold free sine omni molestia & exactione. and warrants them contra omnes homines sicut liberam eleemosynam nostram.
                  
                  A like confirmation is from William of Srambroche of the Tithe of Srambroche, granted formerly from his Ancestors to the Priorie.
                  
                     William of Gurnay had giuen to the Priorie certain Tithes in Edintune, which lying dispersed, were not so commodious for the receipt of the Monks as of the Parson of the Parish. thereupon Galiena, grand-child to William, declares, that for that cause prouisum est & statutum, vt quaelibet illius Ecclesiae persona nomine Decimarum illarum liberaliter soluent annuatim praedictis Monachis Rouecestriae quinque solidos, ad festum beati Andreae. and so confirms both the gift of her Ancestor and this composition between the Parson of Edintune and the Prior and Couent.
                  
                     Haimo filius Guidonis de Dudindale, confirms, in puram & perpetuam eleemosynam, the gift made by his ancestors Gerold his grand-father, and Guy his father, of all the Tithes of his land in Dudindale. which was afterward confirmed also by his sonne and heire Iohn.
                  
                  
                     Hamelinus de Columbeirs establishes the perpetuall right of all the small Tithes of his Demesnes, in the Chantor of the Priorie, to whom

by ancient possession of his Predecessors, hee found they belonged, when controuersie was about them, twixt the Chantor and Ralf Parson of Frendesburie.
                  
                  
                     William the sonne of Thomas of Ysfield and all his coparceners, confirme the Tithes of Ysfield formerly giuen by their Ancestors in puram & perpetuam eleemosynam. and further grant all small Tithes of Ysfield, as of Lamb, Calf, Piggs, Fleece, and the like. Et vt haec nostra donatio (saies the Deed) & confirmatio inconcussa permaneat, ego Willielmus omnium fratrum meorum voluntate pro omnibꝰ sigilli mei appositione corroboro. which I note for the speciall kind of sealing with the eldest brothers seale only.
                  
                     Henrie of Tuang confirms to them Decimam de Tuange quam praefati Monachi habent de dono Smalemanni aui me
                           •
                         tam in Tuange, quam in Rundel.
                  These Grants or arbitrarie Consecrations were all diuers yeers before the end of M.CC. after Christ, and for the most part in the times of Henrie the first, King Stephen, Henrie the second, and Richard the first. neither need you make doubt of the allowance of them by the Clergie of that time. The Tithes so arbitrarily giuen by Lay men were not only possessed by the Priorie, but were also afterward, with others which are not mentiond in the Chartularie, solemnly confirmed to them by the Archbishops

of Canterburie with their Prior and Couent, who supplied that which now is the Deane and Chapter. for in 23. Hen. 2. vpon a controuersie arising about some Tithes challenged by the Priorie, a confirmation was giuen by Richard Archbishop of Canterbury, in which he grounds their right vpon the Deeds of the Grantors. Cognito (are his words) iure praedictorum Monachorum per inspectionem instrumentorum suorum, consideratâ etiam diutura illorum possessione &c. and then he confirms to them all the Tithes granted to them within his Diocese, and reckons by name seuerall Tithes in VIII. Parishes, most of which occur in those examples; After which he confirms also their appropriated Churches with Tithes belonging to them. For Tithes giuen with the Churches appropriated they had as belonging to those Churches. but others seuerally consecrated were no otherwise in them then as if Rents or other profits had been granted out of lands to them. A like confirmation was made by Baldwin in 1. Rich. 1. of all Tithes in particular that were formerly setled in them by Lay mens grants. And another such was by Hubert Archbishop in 1. of King Iohn, wherein he confirms to them omnes Decimas à quibuscunque Dei fidelibus vsque in praesens in Archiepiscopatu nostro illis collatas.

                     Walter Clifford, for the health of his fathers soule, and for his wife and children, giues Ecclesiae de Leonminstre Decimam de tota Hamenesca tam de dominio quàm de villanis s. de omnibus vnde Decimae dantur tam de viuis quam de mortuis But the Church of Lemster is called there the Mother-Church of the place. This was about King Iohns time. And Robert Malherbe giues to the same Church Decimam de toto dominio meo de Riseburie de omnibus, vnde Decimae dantur tam de viuis quam de mortuis.

                  And Maurice of Totham and Muriel his wife grant to the Nunnerie, Ius parochiale in perpetuo habendum in terris nostris quas habemus & tenemus de Episcopo Londinensi iuxta Londoniam, & in hominibus in eisdem terris existentibus & in certis terris nostris quae ad Parochiam pertinent.
And further, that those Lands and his Tenants should be ioind 
                        Iure Parochiali to the Church of the Nunnerie, Et quod homines illi reddant & faciant quae Parochiani debent reddere & facere suae Matri Ecclesiae.
And that the Nunnes should quietly enioy all Tithes of those Lands, according to the intent of the Grant from the Priorie of Lewes in Sussex; which also is rememberd elsewhere in the same Chartularie.
                  
                     Maude of Mandeuill, Countesse of Essex and Hereford grants, Totam Decimam totius victus nostri & familiae nostrae vbicunque fuerimus de panibus & potibus & carnibus & etiam de Piscibus sicut in Carta Domini G. de Mandeuilla Comitis Essexiae antecessoris nostri continetur.
And a great Curse is added to all such as should disturbe or preuent the Nunnes in their enioying of that Tithe. The reference made is to that which is before mentioned in the Patent of Confirmation, made by Henrie the second. This of Maude was about

the beginning of Henrie the third, and is but a confirmation of that of Geffrey of Mandeuill, made Earle of Essex by Maude the Empresse.

                     Eodem anno Domini (videlicet M.LXX.) in villa de Fordwico, Willielmus Rex contulit Sancto Augustino & fratribus eiusdem coenobij, Ecclesias de Fauersham & de Middeltune, & Decimas de omnibus redditibus prouenientibus ex illis duobus Manerijs S. de Middeltune & Fauersham & Decimam de omnibus appendentibus, Terra, Syluis, Pratis, & Aqua, excepta Decima Mellis & Gabuli denariorum. Et sunt istius donationis septem Cartae diuersorum Regum praeter istam.
That Gabulus denariorum is rent paid in money. Scotland was then Abbot there.
                  In the same Abbots time, Odo Bishop of Bayeux, and Earle of Kent, gaue to the Abbey,
Decimas aliquas quas mei fideles habebant, id est, Athelwoldus de tribus villis quae dicuntur Knolton, Tiskenherst, Ringelton, & Decimam totius terrae Turstini, necnon Decimam Osberni filij Letardi de duobus locis, id est, Bedlesangre. Decimam etiam Osberni Payfori de villula quae dicitur Bochland. Haec

omnia (as the words of his Charter are) dono concedo & confirmo &c. Si quis verò huic donationi contrarius fuerit, vel aliquam calumniam ingesserit, aeterno anathemate ipso facto sit reus & Regiae Maiestatis &c.
Then the Autor tells vs, that afterward William d' Aubigny wrongfully took the Tithe of Knolton and Ringelton from the Abbey, as Roger of Memires did the Tithe of Bochland.
                  
                  In the yeer M.LXXIX. Scotland being still Abbot, Herebert Fitz-Iuo gaue to the Abbey,
Decimas quinque Mansionum suarum vel centum solidos nummorum quod in arbitrio Abbatis & fratrum S. Augustini constituit vtrum Decimas ipsas vel centum solidos pro Decimis acceptarent.
Those fiue Mansiones, or Farmes, or Mannors, were Oliue, Ewelle, Osprenge, Heregedsham, and Langedone. But this Tithe was afterward (sayes Sprot) wrongfully detaind from them by William Peuerell.
                  
                  About the same time, Abbot Scotland made a Lease of V. Solings (that is, Solins, or Selions, which are made the same with Hides, or Ploughlands, by some Regist. Monasterij S. Martini de Bello in Arthiuis

                  The same Abbot leased for life to Amfrid Mauclerc his Land of Riple, and of Aluetune, vpon like condition, that Mauclerc should pay

to the Abbey all the Tithes both of those Lands as also of his V. Mannors, Hortun, Legu, Ernolton, Seeldrisham, and Oslacestone, and also all other Tithes of his yeerely encrease whatsoeuer.

                  When Hugh of Trottescliue, Abbot there, founded his Hospitall of S. Laurence, among other Endowments, hee gaue it, Totam Decimam totius annonae de dominio de Langeport
                     .
This was vnder King Stephen.

                  At the foundation of the Church, new built

by Abbot Ioffrid, in the time of Henrie the first, a great meeting was of the deuouter sort of Yorkeshire men specially, and others, to the number of aboue fiue thousand in all.
and most of them laid stones at it, and vpon the stones, some offered Money, some the Patronages of Churches granted by Charters, others Tithes of their Lands: as for example, the words are, Iuxta illum proximum lapidem versus Boream posuit Simon Miles & vxor eius Gulana offerentes Ecclesiae Decimam de Morton, & de Schapwik; & iuxta illos proximum lapidem versus Boream posuit Reinerus de Bathe Miles & vxor eius Goda offerentes operi Decimam de Houtona & de Birtona.

                  The Abbot and Couent, about 20. of Henrie the third, gaue to the Church of the holy Trinitie de Bosco, and the Nunnes there, for euer, Totam Decimam de dominio nostro de Caysho in omnibus rebus de quibus Decimae dari solent, and two parts of the Tithe Corne of the Parish of Watford, and some other moities of Tithes, the rest being in the Parson of Watford. But that of the demesnes of Caysho was newly now created, and expressed for the prouision of apparrell for the Nunnes. But this being so long after the Constitution of Lateran, and being made only out

of their demesnes which perhaps they had discharged, doth only giue an example among many, of another originall way of creation of tithes in some Monasteries, but not so much adde to or confirm the arbitrarie course of disposition of them by Lay men in times before that so frequently vsed.

This was either a confirmation of a consecration made by De Lauall, or els a gift of Tithes out of the same lands, by the King, after some escheat or other new title accrued to the Crown. The Church or Priorie of Tinemuth was giuen to the Abbey of S. Albons by William the second, after Robert de Mowbray had forfeited the Patronage, among the rest of his estate, by treason.
                  
                     Henrie the second confirms to the Monks of Tinemuth all their Churches appropriated, and Decimas de Corebriga, & Newburna, & de Wertewrtha, & de Rodbiria, & de Botala & Wlonera, & de Wylum & Ditentona, & de Caluerduna, & de Alswicha, & de Anibella, & Decimas de Dominio de Herth, & de Setona, & de Tunestal, & de Daltona, & de Mideltona, & de Ouinthuna. All which were, without Churches, formerly and in perpetuall right consecrated by the owners deuotions. the like often occurres in confirmations made to them by the succeeding Kings.
                  
                     
                     In 7. Rich. 1. Hugh of Pudsey Bishop of Durham, confirms to the Monks of Tinemuth, Omnes Decimas & obuentiones tam in blado quam in alijs decimationibus tam de dominijs Regis quam Baronum, siue aliorum fidelium & propriarum villarum, & dominiorum tam in Northumbria quam in Haliwarchfolk (that is in the Territorie of the Bishoprique of Durham) ita plenariè & liberè possidendas, sicut eas pleniùs & meliùs habuerunt vel habere debuerunt, tempore nostro vel antecessorum nostrorum, & sicut donatorum Cartae testantur.
And some other Churches of such generall ratification they haue from the Archbishop of York.
                  
                  In the instrument of foundation of the Cell of Belveir, made between Abbot Paul and Robert of Belvedeir or Belveir, or de pulchro visu, that Robert grants it the Tithes of all Lands that he should hereafter purchase. Omnium terrarum quascunque per Dei adiutorium & concessum Regis in suum dominium ad quirere, quoquo modo posset, dedit & concessit Decimas eidem Ecclesiae sanctae Mariae; that is to the Cell; which was at first purposed for a Parish Church, but by aduice of Archbishop Lanfrank was cōuerted into a Cell. Dedit etiam & concessit Decimas Vinearum suarum omnium & sedem molendini in proxima aqua, & concessit Decimas decem villarum ad praesens, ex suo videlicet dominio annonae, omnium que rerum

de quibus Decima danda est & datur, semota quidem tertia parte Presbyteri villae. The names of the Mannors or Towns of which he thus gaue two parts of the Tithes, are, Horton, Fraton, Saperton, Rishendon, Stoches, Wiberteston, Segeton, Medburne, Wiwell, and Wlstanestorp.
                  
                  
                     Robert of Piriton gaue to the Abbey, the Church of Saint Marie that he had built in Piriton; and endowd it with gift of all the Tithe, eiusdem villae sui dominij & omnium suorum hominum ibi manentium omnium illarum rerum de quibus recte Decima datur; And in Nicenton he gaue all the Tithe of his demesnes only. In Cauendeis & Hocaton & Aperston, Decimam dominij sui, excepta cantaria.
                  
                  
                     Ralf of Limesi gaue to the Church of Saint Marie also that he built in Piriton, Decimam suam in eadem villa &c. & Decimas hominum eiusdem villae ipsis libentèr concedentibus. Apud Nicentonam dedit duas partes Decimae suae &c. apud Hulferlea dedit similiter duas partes Decimae suae & apud Eprestunam similiter & apud Cauendeis & Hocktentunam. And these endowments are there called beneficium Ecclesiae. These and other Tithes so seuerally granted are confirmed to the Abbey by Alan de Limsey, Gerard de Limsey and others of the posteritie of Ralf. The Tithe of the Agistment of Bibesworth-wood, also was granted by Ralf, and of other Agistments, with prouision also that if the woods were assarted

or improued by culture, the Abbey should haue Tithe in kind of the improuements. The whole Deeds o

                  About the yeer M.C.LXXX. a confirmation is made by William S. Iohn, of what had been formerly granted to the Priorie by his Ancestors; and among other possessions, occurres Decima de Chienore, and Decima omnium nemorum suorum de honore Halnaci in paissone & venditione, & alijs exitibus.
And this William for the maintenance of a fourteenth Monk (there being but thirteen by the first foundation) which he added, gaue, 
                        Decimam gabulorum suorum de
                      Estretintona, and other places. & ex dono Petri de Hampton decima molendini sui, is related to be theirs.
                  The same William in another Charter grants,
In subscriptis Ecclesijs scilicet Walborton, Barnaham, Hantoneta, Honestum, Mundeham, duas portiones de terris & decimis omnibus quae ad ipsas pertinent (for the third parts were assigned by him, and the Bishop, and the Prior to Vicarages) & in omnibus praescriptis Ecclesijs aduocationem liberam & praesentationem Presbyterorum qui in sua persona in illis Ecclesijs Deo assiduè deseruiant &c. Et reddidi Decimam Gabulorum de Stretinton, videlicet VIII. solidos per annum; and the Tithe of other Rents.
                  
                     Robert S. Iohn, brother of this William, giues

                     Decimam omnium gabulorum de Walborton, & Decimam omnium gabulorum totius villae de Bernham quam frater meus Willielmus de S. Iohanne dedit mihi, ad tenendum in seruitio Dei quartumdecimum Monachum in Conuentu Boxgraue, quia priùs solùm tredecim fuerant. Quod si quartusdecimus ibi defuerit, Tustinus nepos Dunelinae vel haeres suus colliget & tenebit eas vsque ad annum integrum; si verò vltra; dabuntur pauperibus & viduis, & Orphanis duarum villarum. Teste Willielmo de S. Iohanne, Waltero & Willielmo Capellanis, Rogero Hai, & Thoma filio suo, Rogero de Kaisnei.
                     
And a confirmation is there also by William S. Iohn of the gift (that is of the profits receiud by the Lord in mony or rent.) which lay indeed properly in the Lessors grant. and therefore also William the Lessor had by another Charter granted those Decimas Gabuli to Robert, to the same purpose, which he expresses in his Deed of consecration to the Priorie. the Lessor's grant to him, the confirmation and his consecration were enough to setle this Tithe-rent in the Monasterie. but cleerly this could not haue discharged any former right of Tithes in kind payable out of the Land.
                  The Churches of Warberton and Bernham and the rest before named with others, were, with the belonging Tithes, appropriated to the Priorie, but the Tithes alone of Thadeham and

                     Kienor (which they call Chienor) were by grant from the Ancestors of the S. Iohns, setled in the Priorie and neuer named with any Church, as appears in sundrie Confirmations of them. So also is Decima de Liperinges, in the ratification of such Grants to them made about that time by Iohn and Seffrid Bishops of Chichester and Richard Bishop of Canterburie. Of that Tithe of Liperinges see more within a few lines.

A like Instrument of Confirmation from him, is of two parts of the Tithes of Suho, and of a third part of the Tithes of Einseburie, which had been likewise formerly setled by arbitrarie consecration, in the Monasterie.

This was about the fourth yeer of King Iohn, and was confirmd by the Bishop of Ely.

                  This was afterward confirmed by the heires of Robert Waste. but in the Confirmations it appears, that Torold Waste had also granted it before Robert. Torold, I thinke, was Roberts father, and had granted it about Henrie the second his time.
                  In the Titles of the Deeds there, is Carta Roberti de Ferrers de Decimis de Benewell. but the Charter it selfe is wanting.

                      made in the time of King Stephen to the Priorie of Lewes in Sussex, after some immunities giuen them in all Lands which they held of his fee, this Grant follows: Dono etiam illis de omnibus dominijs meis plenariam Decimam, videlicet, de Blado, de Foeno, de Agnis,

de Velleribus, de Caseis, & plenariam Decimam denariorum de omnibus redditibus meis de Anglia.

The intent of this was to setle the Tithes of all his reuenues wheresoeuer through England, in the Priorie. in kind, of his demesnes; in mony, of his Rents. neither did he grant only the Tithe of what he then was seised of, but of all future purchase also and improuements. that liuerie of seisin, as it were, made vpon the Altar by the Haire of the head both of the Grantor and of his brother, is not without other example of those ancient times wherin both Tithes Videsis App. ad Concil. Lateran. part. 47. cap. 5.and other possessions were solemnly consecrated, either by haire, or a horn, or a cup, or a knife, or a candlestick, or whateuer that might really be deliuered on the Altar. For, the forme of conueiance in perpetuall right, both to the Church and Laitie, was to giue into 
                        Jngulph. hist. fol. 512. b.
                      the hands of the Grantee or Feoffee some such thing, as at this day a Twig or a Turff is in feoffments. or as in Institutions (according to the Formularie of the Court of Rome) a Ring is to be giuen. and the Altar was vsually made the place of such a liuerie. But in the examples of cutting the haire especially in this where Henrie Bishop of Winchester doth it, perhaps more was vnderstood then only a liuerie vpon the grant. had it not also some reference to the ancient ceremonie of cutting the haire at a Confirmation? which was vsually done by the Godfathers,

as may be collected out of that of Adreuald, where 
                        De Mirat. S. Benedicti lib. 1. cah. 14. he speaking of Charles Martell, saies, that Pepigit hic foedus cum Luitprando, ei

                         filium suum Pipinum misit vt more Christianorum fidelium eius capillum primus attonderet, ac pater illi spiritualis existeret. I dare affirm nothing with confidence herein. But it is specially obseruable that this Charter of the Earle of Surrey was not, it seems, made without great aduice as well as testimonie, both of Clergie and Laymen. wherto you may adde the iudgement of Theobald Archbishop of Canterburie, in his reprehension of Ala, Countesse dowager of Warren and Surrey, for not payment of the Tithes of her dowrie according to the Grants of the Ancestors of her husband.
The original of the admonition to her, speaks thus: 
                        
                           In thesauro Cottoniano.

Dilectae filiae suae Alae, Comitissae Warennae salutem. peruenit ad aures nostras religiosorum fratrum Lewensis Ecclesiae Monachorum, stupenda querimonia quam cum ipsi ex antiqua donatione Comitum Warrennae, videlicet Aui & patris Willielmi viri tui, & sui ipsius etiam antequam Dotem tuam consecuta fuisses, de omnibus Dominijs Comitis Decimationem Denariorum semper inconcusse, tanquam Ecclesiae suae dotem possederint, tu, post perceptam dotis tuae inuestituram, eiusdem fratribus ipsam Decimationem,

quae ad Dotem tuam spectabat, subtraxeris. Quod si ita est, vehementèr admiramur cum eorum quae Deo & Ecclesiae suae in eleëmosynam collata esse noscuntur nihil doti tuae vendicare debeas nec possis. Crudelen. est & sacrilegio proximum quod super diuinum Altare semel deuote oblatum est iterùm repetere, & ad secularia transferre. proindè tibi salubritèr consulimus, & in Domino admonemus quatenus sicut vis ius tuum tibi à Deo liberè conseruari, ita ius suum cum integritate Monachis relinquas. & nullatenus datam eis denariorum decimationem dotis tuae retineas; alioquin eis in iustitia deesse non poterimus, cuius debitores omnibus existimꝰ.
Although he speaks only of the Decimatio denariorum, yet in regard that he mentions it with de omnibus Dominijs Comitis, it cannot be well vnderstood otherwise then of all the Tithes of the Earles possessions, according to the former grant.
                  
                     Richard de Muchegros about King Iohns time, confirms to the Abbey of Persore two parts of the Tithes which was wont to be paid to it out of his land of Wlhaueshulle, tam bladi quam lini & faeni (exceptis linis Curtilagij mei de Dominico meo de Wlhaueshulle) as also the third part of the Tithes of his Tenants there, and further grants them Duas partes decimarum bladi de omnibus assartis meis ibidem de nouo factis & de omnibus

assartis per me vel per haeredes meos in posterum faciendis &c. this is sealed. the seale is circumscribed with ✚. S. Richardi de Wlhaueshule.

It is a singular example, and, as I remember, not

seconded or specially noted elsewhere in our Law books; and therefore I transcribe it whole.

What can the intent of this be other, then that the Bishop, the King, and manie other Grandes of the Kingdome, did vsually grant or collate the Tithes of their Demesnes; which, because they were so grantable at the owners will, were (by the meaning of this Writ)

exempted from the Spirituall Iurisdiction. But thereof more anon. Perhaps the Writ is immediatly to be vnderstood of Tithes collated in like sort as a Church; so that he which collated them, had aduocationem Decimarum (which appeares also in the Register) as any other conferring a Church, had Ecclesiae aduocationem. If not so; whence could the collation of these Tithes haue originall, sauing only from the making them seuerally a kind of Benefice (vnder the name of Decimae seperatae, that is, annext to no Church, as the Marginall note in the Register well calls them) by arbitrarie Grant at first of the owner, no otherwise then a Church was made a Benefice to be bestowd, by the arbitrarie Ordinance of the Patron, at the foundation? Cleerly, had not the vse of conueyance of Tithes seuerally by Grant, preceded in practice, it could not haue been, that Quamplures magnate regni (as the Writ sayes) might Decimas liberè conferre in dominicis suis. Tithes alone could neuer haue been collated like a Benefice, had they not been first founded or created as a Benefice. And the Writ might seeme indeed to beare euen the character of the time wherein that vse of arbitrarie Grants of Tithes was known, as of common practice; which I vnderstand to be about King Iohns time; and that, before the Popes Decretalls, or other autoritie, had taken away the Lay-mens challenged libertie of granting Tithes seuerally,

according to the former example. And the rather might that coniecture hold, because also the Sigle expressing the Bishops name, is H. which by all likelyhood denotes Hugh Archdeacon of Wells, being L. Chancellor to King Iohn, and Bishop of Lincolne. But it may be also, that it was had of later time, and at the suit of Henrie of Lexinton, made Bishop of Lincolne in 38. Hen. 3. and that, after Parochiall right was more setled. For notwithstanding the setling of it, and making Tithes then payable de iure communi to the Parish-Rector, yet it is certaine, that the former Grants (what through generall Confirmations from Rome, what through the Lay mens standing vpon their Patronages of Tithes, and vpon the Grantees acknowledgement of their first deuotions in such Consecrations) still continued, and were subiect (in case the Aduocatio Decimarum might come in question) to such a Prohibition, vntill some alteration was therein made, as anon shall be shewed, where wee speake of the ancient vse of the Writ of Indicauit. But of what time soeuer the Writ was, it is plain, that the ground of it must come from that vse of arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes, which seuerally also (as in it is supposed) made sometimes a kind of Benefices that might be collated at the will of those who were owners of the Land whence the Tithes were payable. How could Tithes seuerally be collated by any Grandes, but from such originall

examples as are alreadie copiously deliuered? A like In Codice Ms. Coenobij Osniens. in Bibl. Cotton. precedent of a prohibition I haue seen 7. Ed. 1. which because it so confirms the ancient purpose of that in the Register, shall be here at large deliuered. Edwardus &c. Archidiacono Wilteshyr. & eius Commissarijs salutem.

                      into Lay hands; yet in this Kingdom, where those infeodations were not, or were very rare (whereof anon more) how can it be well vnderstood but of new Grants or arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes as well not before in esse, as of others conueid by Inuestiture of Churches.

                  Out of those examples of Conueiances and arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes (being but a few, and as an essay only of the multitude of them, which might be found in the Lieger books of other Monasteries) may easily be collected, the truth of those assertions in the old yeer books, which haue, without desert, been taken for falshoods grounded only vpon ignorance. By the practiced Law, cleerly euery man gaue the perpetuall right of his Tithes to what Church he would, although the Canon Law were against it; whereof also notice, it seems, is sometimes taken in those conueiances which haue the words of Quae decimari debent, as if they had said, Tithes of all things which by the Canon Law ought to be tithed, or, Quae decimari debent more Catholico, as the words are in a Charter 
                        In Armario Cottoniano.
                      of about Henrie the seconds time, of Gilbert one of the Earles of Hertford, to the Priorie of S. Marie Oueries in Southwark of the Tithes of Capefeld. And it is like enough, that according to the recitalls of those Decretalls noted in the former Chapter, in some places deuotion had bred an obedience to the Canons in this point; but, that it was generall through the Kingdome, is most false. and whateuer the Pope wrote from Rome, we know the truth by a cloud of home-bred witnesses. But also those words, Decimari debent or solent, so

often occurring, may be vnderstood of such things as vsed to be tithed when Tithes were arbitrarily paid, as among the Gentiles, or Christians, he that offers de ijs quae offerri solent, intimates not so much any necessarie dutie acknowledged by him, as a custome of offering such things, when offrings were arbitrarily made. And although in the book of Domesday it be specially found of one Stori an ancestor of Walter of Aincurt, that he might sine alicuius licentia facere Ecclesiam (in Darby and Notinghamshire) in sua terra & in sua soca, & suam decimam mittere quo vellet, as if it had been his singular prerogatiue, in his possessions of Graneby, Mortune, Pinnesleg, and other Mannors; yet was that libertie or prerogatiue aswell of building Churches as arbitrarie conueiance of Tithes not alreadie consecrated either by deed or prescription, common, it seems, to all Lords of Mannors or large Territories, vntill about the time of K. Iohn. For that of Tithes; the examples and autorities before cited iustifie it. For the building of Churches (which considered with the arbitrarie endowments of them with new Tithes, specially belongs also to this disquisition) it was affirmd for a common libertie of the Baronage in letters of King Iohn to Innocent the third, as you may see in the Popes answer to the King.

It was challenged without licence; but the Pope allows it to the Laitie, so that they had licence from the Bishop of the Diocese, and withall that the new foundations bereaued not ancient Churches of their assigned endowments. But after the time of K. Iohn, few or none of those arbitrarie consecrations are found. yet in Henry the thirds time some were, as you may see in those of Fines taken out of the Chartularie of Gisburn. but remember also they were in the Prouince of Yorke. Neither were those Grants disallowd by either Common or Canon Law here then practiced. and in thoses

as they are at this day belonging to the Parish-Rector, but by speciall title of Consecration or Prescription. and the ius Parochiale there, was the right of hauing the Cure and Offerings of the Parishioners, which had not necessarily annext to it the right of Tithes by the practice of that time. whence it came that Parochiani & Decimae are both there mentioned as seuerall demands in the Actors Libell. and hereof see more anon in the corollarie of the ancient Iurisdiction of Tithes in England. and that admonition of Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury (before cited) to Ala Countesse of Warren, is obseruable. is it not apparant that he allows not only the arbitrarie Consecrations made by the Earles, but also reprehends her sharply for not performing what they had therein vowed? But in the ensuing times, after that the Canon Law had here gained greater strength, which happend soon vpon Innocent the third his thundering out his Interdict against this Kingdom, his Excommunication against the King, and frighting the subiects with his Bulls stufft with commination, and that against this very point of arbitrarie conueiances of Tithes; it soon came to be a receiud Law, that all Lands regularly were to pay Tithes to the Parish or Mother Church according to the prouision of the Canons. and therefore vpon Delegation made by Pope Innocent the fourth in 49. Hen. 3. to the Priors of S. Trinitie,

Bartholomew in London, and the Archdeacon of Westminster for the deciding of a controuersie twixt the Abbesse and Nunnes of Chartris by Ely, and Robert Passelew Archdeacon of Lewes, about some Tithes of the possession of the Nunnerie in Barington, it appears that in Passelews libell, no other title is made, but that the Land lies infra limites Parochiae suae de Barenton, vnde petit dictam Abbatissam compelli integrè ad solutionem dictarum decimarum cum damnis & interesse &c. and some others like are of that time according to the Law that to this day continues, as may especially be found in the books of

Nicholas of Crainford, Parson of Gilingham, complaind to the King, Quod cum Foresta Domini Regis, ibidem sita, sit infra Parochiam suam, quod Dominus Rex Decimam faeni, venationis, pannagij, & aliorum prouentuum ipsius forestae de gratia & pro salute animae suae, & animarum praedecessorum suorum, Ecclesiae suae cui de iure communi debentur plenè solui praecipiat, secundum formam supplicationis & exhortationis Apostolicae porrectam Dominio R. apud Gilingham quando fuit ibi ad Natale.
What was that supplicatio or exhortatio Apostolica? did not some such thing, comming from Rome about the time of the Councell of Lions, make the Monks think it a thing agreed vpon in that Councell? it seems here too, that in the Kings case, Parochiall right of Tithes was not yet euery where setled, although the Tithes were encreasing in a Parish.
               
               
                  IV.
                  After this establishment of Parochiall right, new arbitrarie conueiances out of lands lying in any Parish, were not permitted, but ancient consecrations were still retained, and had confirmation either from prescription or Papall priuilege which were, by the Canons, sufficient titles to be pleaded against the common right

claimed by Parish Rectors. And when this innouation grew in Parochiall right, then also the iurisdiction which the common or secular Law had formerly challenged and exercised in detaining the right of Tithes (between the Parish and Parishioner) grew out of vse; and the legall proceeding became to be regularly according to the Canons which brought the practice to be as since it hath continued. But of the ancient iurisdiction more anon. So was it now come to that passe, that no new arbitrarie consecrations might be made of the Tithes of lands lying in any Parish. But yet for such lands as were not Parochially limited, the ancient libertie was retained. and although by the Canon Law the Bishop is to haue all Tithes growing in lands not assigned to any

Hen. 4 fol. 17. b. & Brook tit. Dismes 10. been and (I think) are in diuers Forests. And hereof saies Thorp in 22. Assis. pl. 75.

But, vnder fauor this was vnderstood only of the Kings granting the tithes

of his Demesnes occupied by his Bailifes according as in ancient time euery man els did. for whateuer the words seeme to import, Thorp speaks only of such lands of the possession of the Crown; in which case, it must not perhaps be vnderstood so much, a part of the Royall prerogatiue as a right due to the King by common Law, in regard of his possession of lands not limited to any Parish. Neither doth he affirm that Tithes of such places are due to be paid to the Crown, but that they are in the King to grant at his pleasure, if growing in his demesnes. But to this purpose is a notable case in the Parliament rolls of
                        In Recept. Scaccarij, & in Cod Vet. apud V. C. I. Borough regiorum in arce Lond. Seriniorum prasectum.
                      18. Ed. 1. where Ralph Bishop of Carleol Petit versus Ecclesiae Priorem de Karliel Decimas duarum placearum terrae, of the new assarts in the Forest of Inglewood, whereof the one is called Linthwait, the other Kirkthwait, Quae sunt infra limites Parochiae Ecclesiae suae de Aspaterike &c. and laies by praescription in his predecessors the Tithes of the pannage there, before the assarting or culture. Henrie of Burton also, Parson of Thoresby, claimed in Parliament the same Tithes as belonging to his Church, and infra limites Parochiae suae. and the Prior comes & saies, that Henricꝰ Rex vetus (Henrie the first, it seems) concessit Deo & Ecclesiae suae Beatae Mariae Karliel omnes Decimas de omnibus terris quas in culturam redigeret infra Forestam, & inde eos feoffauit per quoddam cornu eburneum quod dedit

Ecclesiae suae praedictae &c. Whereupon the Kings Attorney, Dicit quod Decimae praedictae pertinent ad Regem & non ad alium, quia sunt infra bundas Forestae de Inglewood, & quod Rex in Foresta sua praedicta potest villas aedificare, Ecclesias construere, terras assartare, & Ecclesias illas cum Decimis terrarum illarum pro voluntate sua cuicunque voluerit conferre, eò quod Foresta illa non est infra Limites alicuius Parochiae &c. Et petit quod Decimae illae Domino Regi remaneant prout de iure debent ratione praedicta &c. Et quia Dominus Rex super praemissis vult certiorari, vt vnicuique tribuatur quod suum est. William of Vesci, Iustice of the Forest beyond Trent, and Thomas of Normanuill, his Escheator for those parts (for so was the diuision anciently of Escheatorships) were assigned Commissioners to enquire of the truth, & certificent Regem ad proximum Parlamentum &c. So are the words of the Record. Where the Attorney challenges not the right by prerogatiue, but only in regard that the place being the demesne Land of the Crowne; & not assigned to any Parish, the Tithes are grantable by the King, as owner, at his pleasure. And so it well agrees both with that liberty challenged by King Iohn in the name of his Baronage, that they might found new Churches at their pleasure in their owne fees (before the establishment of Parochiall right in Tithes) as also with the more ancient practice of the Kingdom,

whereby Tithes might not be parochially exacted, nor were so reputed due, but by the owners arbitrarily conueyed in perpetuall right. And whereas Herle, in 7. Ed. 3. fol. 5. a. sayes generally, That no man might arbitrarily giue his Tithes that are not within Parochiall Limits, but that the Bishop of the Diocesse should haue them. It seems, he spake suddenly, as out of the Canon Law, and not according to the Law of England. And hee addes, that it is against reason, Que home ne purra my granter ses almoignes a que il vouldra.

therein depasturing, to the Church within whose Parish the owner dwelleth.

                  AS by Consecrations seuerally, so, with Churches, in Appropriations, Tithes were frequently conueyed, and by expresse name. as Ecclesia de N. cum Decimis, or the like, are vsually giuen Monachis, Monialibus

&c. ibidem Deo seruientibus &c. according to what is before noted of other Countries. But this Mention of Tithes, with Churches in Appropriations, was rare, or not at all, till after the Normans. In the Saxon times, many appropriated Churches are found, and that from between D.CC. and D.CCC. yeers since, till the Normans. but the Charters that conueyed or confirmed them, haue vsually nothing but Ecclesias and so many Carues or Yard Lands, or so much rent annext to them, nor speaking at all of any Tithes transferd with them. For speciall examples of such ancient Appropriations, you may see the recitalls of the Charters of King Bertulph, King Beored, and King Edred, made to the Abbey of Crowland, and inserted in Ingulphus. But after the Normans, in Appropriations, most commonly, the Church is exprest, Vna cum Decima (that is, the Tithe annext or consecrated to it) in annona, or in other kind, and the places sometimes are named where the encrease of the Tithe grew. Such examples are very obuious, especially in the Chartularies of Abingdon and Rochester. And, as is before noted, the most common intent (allowd also by Canonicall confirmation, which sometime but rarely was added in those elder ages) was, that the Corporation whereto the Appropriation was made, should put Clerks or Vicars in the Churches so conueyed to them, which were to answer to them

for all temporall profits, as Tithes and other reuenues (although the Churches were distant many hundred miles sometimes from the Monasteries; for a Church in one Kingdome also was often appropriated to a Monasterie of another) and to the Ordinarie for spirituall function. The generall Confirmations that are sometimes found of that time, make it manifest. and for the two Prouinces, it is not amisse to adde here these two examples of it. In 17. Will. 1. Thomas Archbishop of York makes a generall Confirmation

And in those times, as is alreadie deliuered, it was most frequent, to haue presentations made by Monasteries to their appropriated Churches; and the Vicar-Incumbents or Presentees had no more of the profits (notwithstanding the institution then the Monasteries would arbitrarily allow them. Neither followd any disappropriation vpon such Presentation, howeuer the later Law be taken otherwise. Nor was there any perpetuall certaintie of profits or reuenues to their Presentees, vntill such time as the Monks, by composition with the Ordinaries, or by their owne Ordinance (which prescription after confirmed) appointed some yeerly salarie in Tithes, or Glebe, or Rent, seuerally for the perpetuall maintenance of the Cure; which Salaries became afterward perpetuall Vicarages.

                  In those elder Appropriations, it appears that the Church and the Tithes, and what else was ioind with it as part of the assigned reuenue, by the practice of the time passed in point of interest from the Patron by his gift (which oftentimes was by liuerie of a book or a knife on the Altar) not otherwise then freehold conueid by his deed & liuerie. Neither was confirmation or assent of the Ordinarie (as it seems) necessarie as of later time. Obserue this one example of the Church of Waldren appropriated to the Priorie of Lewes in Sussex by Robert of Dene, wherin he as Patron appoints also the conditions to which the Presentee or Vicar-encumbent of the Priorie should be subiect.

I know what is said in the later Law of the Kings power as suprem Ordinarie for the part of Iurisdiction, and I acknowledge it, as all ought. but in those elder times, that was not the matter which made appropriations good, where his confirmation had place, and none was from the Bishop. at least it cannot at all be proued that his suprem Iurisdiction spirituall was so much thought of in them, although otherwise apparant testimonie be of the exercise of such iurisdiction & of the right of it in the elder ages in this Kingdome. But the reason of appropriations so practiced by lay Patrons only, was the challenged right which in those times they most commonly vsed in disposition of their Churches, as if they had been all Donatiues by collation (without presentation) that is by Inuestiture

from their own hands only, which gaue their Incumbents reall possession of the Tithe of the Church and all the reuenues, no lesse then presentation, institution, and induction doe at this day. For howeuer, not only the Decrees both of the Pope and generall Councells, were anciently against that kind of inuestiture, but also the Prouinciall or Nationall Synods here held, had like Canons forbidding it, as in 3.

and it is specially obserueable, how ill the Baronage of England tooke it when Anselm vnder Henrie the first would haue, through Papall Canons, inhibited the practice of inuestitures, vsed by the King and other lay Patrons, which is recorded in an Epistle 
                        Epist. Anselm. Ms. 195. in Bibl. Cottoniana.
                      of that Anselm, directed to Pope Paschal the second, thus speaking. Domino Reuerendo & Patri diligendo Paschali summo Pontifici Anselmus seruus Ecclesiae Cantuariensis, debitam

This is in the Ms. Volume of Epistles of Anselm, fairly writen by Iohn de Grandisono Bishop of Excester, in the yeer M.CCC.LXIV. in which are aboue C. more then are published in his printed Works. they menaced the Archbishop with banishment, and the Pope with reuolt from his See, only for their withstanding that practice of Inuestiture; whereof, for so much as concernes Abbeies, Priories, or Bishopriques (in giuing them by the ring and baston) much testimonie is in the storie of about that age. and the Kings remission of the Inuestitures of those great dignities is frequent. but, for Parish Churches, of which we here chiefly speake; the common occurrences of Inuestitures mention them

but litle. But for the vse of them known also by the name of Institution; see the Fine anon transcribed of 33. Hen. 2. as also specially a commission sent by Pope Alexander the third, to the

But this course of Inuestiture by Lay men, after Anselmes time, began to bee of lesse vse; and some, obeying the Canons, presented, others still collated by Inuestiture till about Richard the first and King Iohns time, whereof more in the next Paragraph. To the Lay Patrons challenged right of such Inuestiture of Churches and Tithes, belongs specially the Granting of Rents and such like out of Rectories by the Patrons only, and the Sonnes or others Succession in Parish Churches after the death of their ancestors of both which (litle known vulgarly) ancient warrant is yet remayning.

                  For the first; in the Chartularie of the Priorie of S. Needs in Huntingdonshire, one Robert Fitz-water (about King Iohns time) giues to the Priorie six marks of siluer nomine certi beneficij in Ecclesia de Wimbisse annuatim percipiendas per manum personae eiusdem Ecclesiae.

                     mon Law (the Church being full) I think he must. but most vsually a prouision by the Patron was inserted to this purpose, that the seuerall Encumbents should by Oth bind themselues to the true payment. nor was it so necessarie to haue the ordinaries assent, when that, which the Ordinarie by the practice of the later Law is to do in his Institution, was in frequent practice supplied by the Patrons Inuestiture. Out of which may be the better vnderstood that part of the new Canon in the Synod of Westminster, held vnder

Nulli liceat Ecclesiam nomine Dotalitij ad aliquem transferre, that is, That no Patron should giue his Church. as it were in Frankmariage, or make of it a Donatio propter nuptias (as the Ciuilians call it) to remain with the husband of his Daughter or Kinswoman, during his life. How could such a gift haue at all been made by presentation (as of later time it is vnderstood) Institution or Induction?
and a most obseruable example of this matter is in a Fine of 33. Hen. 2. in these words. Haec est finalis concordia facta in Curia Domini Regis apud Cantuariam anno Regni Regis Henrici secundi XXXIII. die

Venetis proxima post festum sancti Iohannis Baptistae Coram Radulpho Archidiacono Colecestriae, & Rogero filio Reinfri, & Roberto de Witefeld, & Michaele Belet Iusticiarijs Domini Regis, & alijs fidelibus Domini Regis ibidem tunc praesentibus inter Priorem de Lewes & Monachis eiusdem loci & Willielmum filium Arthuri, quem Richardus de Budegintun pofuit loco suo ad lucrandum vel perdendum de aduocatione Ecclesiae de Budeketun, vnde placitum erat inter eos in Curia Regis, scilicet quod Prior & Monachi remiserunt & quietum clamauerunt eidem Richardo & haeredibus suis aduocationem praedictae Ecclesiae per ita quod persona quae per ipsum Richardum vel haeredes eius in eadem Ecclesia instituetur, reddet singulis annis Ecclesiae de Lewes IIII. solidos scilicet ad festum Sancti Michaelis. & ille qui in eadem Ecclesia per ipsum Richardum vel haeredes suos instituetur persona, post institutionem suam, coram Episcopo fidelitatem praestabit quod praedictam pensionem praedicto termino Ecclesiae de Lewes persoluet, & posteà in Capitulo de Lewes eandem fidelitatem innouabit.
Here it appears (it seems) by the iudgement of the Kings Iustices, that the Patron had such interest in those times, that he might alone without grant of the Encumbent (who came in by his Institution and Inuestiture) or confirmation of the Bishop, charge the church

with a pension. and this, being in a Fine, is of autoritie beyond exception for that age. But the like is in Rot. Fin. 7. Rich. 1. Lancast. in a Fine leuied between Theobald Fitz-water, demandant in a Writ of Right of Aduowson against the Abbot of Shrewsburie, of the Church of Kirkham, where XII. marke Rent is reserued to the Abbot, with a like clause for the Encumbents fealtie for true payment. the like in Fin. 4. Rich. 1. diuers. Comit. touching the Church of Dacheworth. yet also, in that age, the assent of the Parson and Bishop was somtime had. as in Rot. Fin. 7. Rich. 1. Staff. where, vpon Right of Aduowson by the Prior and Canons of Stanes against Alice Hopton, for the Church of Cheklegh, Alice & Robertus filius & haeres suus per assensum & voluntatem H. Couentrensis Episcopi in cuius Diocoesi Ecclesia illa sita est, & Osberti personae eiusdem Ecclesiae tunc ibidem praesentium, concesserunt praefatis Priori & Canonicis XXs. de eadem Ecclesia de Cheklegh annuatim percipiendos sine omni contradictione imperpetuum de Clerico eandem Ecclesiam possidente quicunque ille fuerit ad duos terminos videlicet ad Pascha Xs. & ad festum S. Michaelis X•. &c, Here the assent of the Parson and Bishop being both present in Court, is inserted in the Fine; yet inough examples shew that it was not (as may be strongly coniecturd) thought altogether necessarie. But indeed howeuer the right of Inuestitures had been then much exercised

by Lay Patrons, yet in case of Clergie Patrons, if the Church were not of exempted iurisdiction, the Bishops more vsually instituted: and therefore was their assent the sooner admitted somtimes into the Fine; and doubtlesse also some lay Patrons willing enough herein to obey the Canons, after Anselm and perhaps before arbitrarily filld their Churches by presentation to the Bishop. this may be collected especially out of that of the grant of the

                     Glanvill chief Iustice of England to Henrie the second, the Bishops institution is spoken of as a thing of not vnknown right vpon a recouerie in Darrain presentment, according as the Canons require. And in an Epistle 
                        In Symbol. Electorum Ms. in Bib. Cotton. of Giraldus Cambrensis (writen in those times to Hugh Bishop of Lincoln about his Parsonage of Cestreton, which he challenged vpon presentation of himself made by Gerard of Camvill, a Gentleman of great worth in Lincolnshire)

the Bishops Institution is spoken of, as cleerely necessarie, according to the Canons, and noted with Episcopus solus honores dare potest; which, you must remember, was writen by one that was feruent for the Canons, and had also writen against the auitae consuetudines or common Laws of that time. But these testimonies must be warily vnderstood, and compared with the former and frequent practice of the contrarie, which about that time, especially vnder Richard the first and King Iohn (it seems) much altered. Neither till about that time can it be found, that the more common practice of Lay mens Inuestitures ceased. Nor was the Bishops Institution presently and vniformely thence vsed, as of later ages. The autoritie of the Clergie had by that time taken away the vse of Lay mens Inuestitures. Yet was it not cleere, it seemes, vpon the practice that here followed, what dignitie of the Clergie should then exercise the Institution: for you shall find it sometimes done by the Archdeacon, as it was also before K. Iohn, in some cases where any Lay man omitted his Inuestiture; as may be gathered out of a Decretall, sent

Ioh. a Writ is awarded to the Archdeacon, as now it ought to the Bishop, vpon recouerie of a Presentment.

The entrie is thus. Recordatum est per G. filium Petri & Simonem de Pateshull quod Simon filius Richardi, tempore Regis Richardi, recuperauit, coram eis & socijs eorum versus Iohannem de Kalceto seisinam Aduocationis Ecclesiae de Buckworth (in Huntingdonshire) per assisam de vltimâ prasentatione, ita quod habuit breue quod Archidiaconus admitteret personam ad Ecclesiam illam ad praesentationem eidem; & ipse Iohannes impediuit eum ita quod implacitauit eum per breue Papae, & Dominus Rex prohibuit placitum, & Simon venit & impetrauit à Rege quod loquela procederet, & quod haberet breue ab Archidiaconum de Clerico suo admittendo & habuit.

Perhaps indeed it happened in the vacancie of the See. for the time so falls, that we cannot be sure of the contrarie. But admit it were so. Plainly, the Archdeacon neither by Canon nor common Law had any more right of Institution, by reason of a Vacancie of the Bishoprique. And certainly, during the vacancie, the Writ should

                  For that other, of Succession in the Benefices of the Ancestors; doubtlesse, that was, often when the father or other ancestor was Incumbent and Patron, and by that challenged right, of the time, of Inuestiture and sole disposition of the Church, would either in his life time conuey the Benefice to his sonne or heire by grant, which by the practice of the time, supplyed, it seemes, as well a Resignation, as Presentation, Institution, and Induction; or would so leaue the Aduowson to discend to his heire, that he (being in Orders) might retaine the Church in his owne hands, according as the Law then, it seems, permitted. Against this, was a Canon made in the Nationall Synod at Westminster in 3. Hen. 1. Vt filij Presbyterorum non sint haeredes Ecclesiarum Patrum suorum. And another in 25.

Without that challenged right of Inuestiture supposed in the Incumbent (hauing also the Patronage) which supplyed all that the Patron, Bishop, and Archdeacon at this day do in filling a Church, how could any Parson make to himselfe a successor or an heire to haue colour to claim the Incū
                     bencie from his ancestor. To this purpose may be well rememberd a passage in a verdict found in Rot. Placit. 6. Rich. 1. Rot. 1. of such a kind of conueyance of S. Peeters Church in Cambridge: the words are; Iuratores benè sciunt quod quidam Langlinus qui tenuit Ecclesiam illam, & qui fuit persona illius Ecclesiae dedit Ecclesiam illam, secundum quod tunc fuit mos Ciuitatis Cantebrigiae, cuidam parenti suo Segario nomine qui illam tenuit per LX. annos & plus, & fuit persona illius Ecclesiae & ipse posteà dedit Ecclesiam illam Henrico filio suo qui illam tenuit per LX. annos & ipse in ligea potestate sua dedit illam Hospitali Cantebrigiae per Cartam suam & idem Hospitali habet Ecclesiam illam. They discreetly find the custome of the Citie to maintaine the Conueyance, supposing (it seems) that the custome would help the last Grantors title, although the Common Law, which had by that time receiued some change herein, by force of the Papall Decrees, should not haue allowd it. I know, in the Canons another thing is also vnderstood in this matter

of Succession, that is, the irregularitie of the sonne of a Clerk; but that can extend only to the matter of Illegitimation vpon Mariage forbidden to the Clergie. For which point alone, the Bishops refusall had been the best helpe, but that indeed the other kind of disposition of Churches by Inuestiture preuented his refusall when Presentation was not made to him.
               
               
                  V.
                  But after such time as the Decretals and the encreasing authoritie of the Canons, about the yeer M.CC. had setled the vniuersall course here of filling of Churches by Presentation to the Bishop, or (as it seems sometimes it was) to the Archdeacon, or to the Vicar of the Bishop, or Gardian of the Spiritualties; that vse of Inuestitures of Churches and Tithes seuerally or together, practiced by Lay men, was left off, and a diuision of Ecclesiasticall & Secular right from thence hath continued in practice. Neither did Vide Rot. pat. 9. Ioh.

his Church at his pleasure. neither was he confined to any time. That time of Laps was (according as the vse of Presentation grew by degrees setled) receiued into the Laws of England out of the generall Vide Rog. de Houeáon, an. 1179.

Hen. 2. vnder Alexander the third; to which, foure Bishops (according to the ancient vse of this Kingdom) that is, Hugh Bishop of Durham, Iohn Bishop of Norwich, Robert Bishop of Hereford, and Reinold Bishop of Bath, were sent as Agents for the Church of England. By that Councell, after vacancie of six moneths, the Chapter is to bestow those Churches, which the Bishop, being Patron, had left so long void; and vpon their default, the Metropolitan. but no word is of Lay Patrons in it.

                      elswher occurres also for praesentare. repraesentare is properly to restore, giue back, or repay, as reddo or repraesto, whence praesentare taken in the barbarous times denoted as dare or donare; so that

                     idoneam personam ad Ecclesiam praesentare was all one with idoneam personam ad Ecclesiam dare or donare, or in Ecclesia constituere, or

So also is the Law in the Kings Case and of common persons, being disturbed to collate by Letters Patents to their free Chappels or Donatiues. the Writ in those Cases is only praesentare, which confirms that it denotes Donation or Inuestiture. But in the Counts

vpon such Writs, the speciall matter must be discouered. The like Law is in the Case of him that hath the Nomination of the Clerk. his Writ is also praesentare, although another haue the right of that which is now known by the bare name of presentation. Nomination indeed or

But the Law is now setled; neither with vs hath the Patron alone now any prerogatiue or direct interest in the Church or the reuenues, beside his right of Aduowson or Presentation to the Bishop, by whose institution and the Archdeacons induction euery Church regularly is to be filled. Neither (for ought I haue heard) hath he in our Law any of those Droicts honorifiques, which the French allow him in Precedence, Seats, and the like. These particulars of Benefices and Aduowsons had here their place, both because in the ancient conueiance of them either by Inuestiture to an Incumbent, or by Appropriation, the reuenue that was in Tithes passed by expresse words, and that in point of interest from the Patron, as also in regard that, at this day, the Patron of a Parson prohibited by Indicauit, to sue in the Spirituall Court for the fourth part of the Tithes of a Church, may haue his Droit d'auowson de Dismes. it was requisit therefore to adde these not vulgar or obuious notes of the Aduowsons in this discouerie of the ancient conueiance and interest of Tithes.

                  I.
                  FRom those arbitrarie Consecrations, and frequent Appropriations of Tithes (whereof we haue hitherto made mention) to Monasteries or other Religious Places, as Colleges of Regulars, Chantries and Free-Chappels, came the present and common Infeodations of them into Lay hands, which began in the age of our Fathers. For, the Portions of Tithes conueied to them out of Closes, parts of Mannors, and whole Demesnes, by the owners, together with the Tithes granted and possessed with appropriated Churches, were first by the Statut of Dissolution of Monasteries in 31. Hen. 8. and by that other of 1. Ed. 6. giuen to the Crown, and from thence granted to Lay men, whose Posteritie or Assignees to this day hold them with like limitation of estate, as they do other enheritances of Lands or Rents. and, for

them, haue like remedie by the Statut of 32. Hen. 8. cap. 7. by reall action as Assise, Dower, or other originals, as for Lands, Rents, or other Lay possessions by the cōmon Law they might haue. But although in other States these Infeodations or Conueiances of the perpetuall right of Tithes to Lay men, be very ancient and frequent also; yet no such certain or obuious testimonie of their antiquitie, is in the moniments of England as can enough assure vs that they were before the Statut of Dissolutions in any common vse here. But some were, and, for aught appears in the practice of the time, many more might equally haue been. And what scruple was there but that long before the generall dissolution of Monasteries, Henrie the fift might (by the Law of the Kingdom) haue made Infeodations into Lay hands (as Henrie the eight did) of all Tithes belonging 
                        Rot. Parl. 2. Hen. 5. part. 2. art. 9. to the Priors aliens whose possessions were giuen to him by Parliament, he had them setled in the Crown in Fee, and afterward disposed of them to other Ecclesiastique Corporations Vide Cart. 2. Hen. 5. part. 1. num. 3. &c.
                      at his pleasure, no otherwise then of other Lay possessions. By the way, we vnderstand, in these Infeodations, by the name of Lay men, only such as were not either in Orders or professed in Religion. for otherwise all the possessions of Tithes enioied by Nunnes and the like, that were indeed Lay (though not commonly called so) might be comprehended vnder

the name of Infeodations. But, that some were here; obserue that of Odo Bishop of Bayeux and Earle of Kent, which is before cited out of the liues of the Abbots of S. Augustines in Canterburie. The words are, Decimas aliquas quas mei fideles habebant &c. What can that be, according to the words, other then Tithes that were in the hands of some of his Tenants? You may adde that of Robert S. Iohn cited before out of the Book of Bosgraue, where he had, by the gift of his brother William, certain Tithes, which he gaue to the Priorie, for maintenance of a fourteenth Monk. And obserue the rest of the Deed there. So out of the Book of Osney it appears before, that Decimatio Nicholai de Stodeham quam Fromundus (Capellanus) tenebat is granted by D'Oilly. Had not D'Oilly this from Stodeham? Or was Stodeham here one of his Bailifes or Fermors, whose Tithe he graunted as Lord or according to couenant with the Lessee? Other such occurre sometimes. And perhaps, Decimae hominū meorum, & the like granted, may suppose a title possessed in the Tithes by the Lay grantor. And in the same Book of 
                        In Biblioth. Cottoniana.
                      
                     Osney, in a Passage writen in a hand of about Hen. 5. touching the conueyances of Tithes by Lay men to Monasteries, it is related, that he that wrote it, saw Quendam Rogerum D'Oyly Dominum cuiusdam partis de Bampton in Episcopatu Lincolniensi suis Decimis ita vti, vt nunc vni nunc alteri

de suis Valettis ipsas conferret annuatim qui sibi in diuersis officijs ministrabant, vntill afterward hee erected a Chaunterie with them in the Church of Bampton. These Grants to his Valets, plainly were as Infeodations. And what els was in that known case of Herne and

                     Pigot in Mich. 39. & 40. Elizab. but an ancient kind of Infeodation, at least an Inheritance of Tithes from immemoriall time in a Lay man? That, and other like to it, might begin vpon reall compositions, and so the Tithes be deriued out of the Church. But regularly, I thinke, at this day no kind of Infeodation is here allowable in Lay mans making title to a perpetuall right of Tithes (except only by the later Statuts of Dissolutions) vnlesse it either be deriued from some old Graunt of discharge from the Parson, Patron, and Ordinarie, (in which case, hee to whom the Infeudation should be made, could haue it only as a Lay profit issuing out of the discharged land) or ioyned with a Consideration to be giuen for maintenance to the Parson, by him that receiues them; and this either from time immemoriall, or by ancient composition. So I take the meaning of our reuerend Iudges to haue been touching this point. In summe then we may affirme, that some such ancient Infeodations haue been in England as in other States; but, that of later time none are allowable (if deriued from Vide in d. Commentatio, ibid.
                      other ancient originall, then from the Statuts of Dissolutions)

vnlesse they bee anciently deriued out of the Church first by discharge, or appeare to be but as a Reward giuen in pernancie, or as Consideration for a Pension or other competent Maintenance yeerely payable to the Parson. Which withall well stands with the common opinion of the originall of such Infeodations; whereof we haue alreadie 
                        Cap. 6. §. 4. spoken. And whereas it hath been resolued, that without these reasons, a Lay man was not here capable, at the common Law, of Tithes by pernancie; it well agrees with a Decretall of

But also, that we may not defraud you of any testimonie of former times, that may seeme obseruable touching these Infeodations, whereof so few examples and so ltttle mention is in the Moniments of England, take this speciall Disquisition, writen in a hand of about Henrie the fifth, in the Booke of

Then sayes he that writes it; he had heard

from a good Ciuill and Canon Lawier, that had been present at the Disputation of the point, in a case happening between a Religious house and a Parson, for Tithes in the Parsons Parish, who claimed them iure communi, that the Aduocat for the Religious house being put to make a speciall title against the Parsons common right, told the Court a long storie of Easterne holy Warres about Pipins time; and interposed somwhat of Charles Martell; and concluded, that the Pope and the Church euery where graunted, in reward to the Christian Princes, for their Barons, Knights, and Gentlemen, that spent their blouds, labours, and estates in those Warres, the priuiledge of arbitrarie disposition of the Tithes of their lands; by reason of which Graunt, they afterward made not only Arbitrarie Consecrations of them, but also Infeodations into Lay hands, according as the common opinion among the Canonists is too confidently receiued at this day. Then he tells vs that before rememberd, of the Tithes in Bampton, and cites some texts out of the Decretalls, that touch Infeodations. Next he relates, that among the Princes of the holy Warre, about Martell and Pipins time, the Duke of Normandie was a speciall one, whence hee had also that priuiledge touching Tithes, pro se ac suis, as the words are. And lastly (to bring it into England) hee thus concludes, Et cum Dux Normanniae Willielmus ad

conquisitionem Angliae venisset, quidam Miles eius Robertus d'Oylleye nomine malens suas Decimas Deo commendare quam contra naturalem Ecclesiae consuetudinem ipsis vti, eas Ecclesiae S. Georgij quam in Castria Oxenford construxit contulit, Et posteà ad Monasterium Osney per Diocesanum & Capitulum Lincoln. ac etiam per Aduocatum Canonicè deuenerunt. But it all tasts of nothing but ignorance. For what touches Martell and his time generally, enough alreadie is said. And see but what a bold ignorance here was, to tell vs, that the Duke of Normandie was one of the greatest (personis Regum exceptis, as his Language is) that went in the holy Warre in succursum Ecclesiae Romanae, in those times of Pipin and Martell? I would he durst haue told vs also who had then been Duke of Normandie. Neither that title of Dignitie, nor that name of the Countrey, were, till about CL. yeers after Martell, at all known. The Territorie being then vnder the French Kings, who long after gaue it to the Normans, and erected it into a Dukedome. Indeed the Duke of Normandie had good place in the later holy Warres, about M.XCV. but did not that make this Aduocat say, that the Duke of Normandie was a speciall Prince in the other also of Martell's time? Such of the later midle times stand not much vpon the mingling of Stories, that differ in themselues euen many whole ages. Besides, he tells vs of strange Princes names of

the East, that made the Warre against the Church. Plainly, the most pretended cause of the rest that erre herein as much as hee doth, is the Saracenicall Warre in Martell's time, and that out of Spain, not from the East. And had it been so vnder Martell's time, as it is vsually affirmd; what had that been to England? But you see his prouidence for that matter, where he deriues it from the Duke of Normandie. But what though there had been some such Duke of Normandie, whose Successor had afterward either conquered or enherited England? had therefore the old supposed priuiledge of retaining or disposing of Tithes, been thence communicated to his subiects of England? and that to the losse of the Church here, that neuer could haue gotten good by the supposed cause of the priuiledge? All the Canon and Ciuill Law that the Aduocat had, could neuer haue proued such a consequent. It will still remaine most probable, if not cleere, that what Infeodations were in England, had their originall as well out of the right of arbitrarie disposition of Tithes challenged by the Laitie, without the grant of the Pope or Church, as out of Compositions or Conueyances from the Clergie; according as in other States. For no sufficient Storie, no credible Moniment, no Passage, or Testimonie of worth, can iustifie that generall right of retainer or disposition to haue been giuen by the Clergie, or Pope,

vpon any cause whatsoeuer; though the Canonists and others that follow them, cry against it, vsque ad rauim. The vse of Infeodations, before those later holy Warres, we haue alreadie shewd. And that no vse of them could be about Martell's time, is not lesse apparant, by what is also before deliuered. But beside this blind testimonie of the ground of Consecrations or Infeodations; for England especially, you may take that (as it is) also of 
                        Tit. de locato & conducto c. licet bona verb. p

                     Lindwood, who thus speaks touching the Portions which Religious houses had. Hae Portiones (saith he) potuerunt peruenisse ad locum Religiosum de concessione etiam Laici cum solîus Diocesani consensu de Decimis vel prouentibus quas Laicus talis ab Ecclesia alia habuit in feudum ab antiquo, according to that in tit. de his quae fiunt à Praelatis sine ass. cap. c. cum Apostolica. And hee addes, that this is only true, if those Tithes were infeodated before that Councell of Lateran of MC.LXXIX. And then concludes with, Nam ante illud Concilium bene potuerunt Laici Decimas in feudum retinere & eas alteri Ecclesiae vel Monasterio dare. Non tamen post tempus dicti Concilij. For his interpretation of the Councell, enough before, towards the ends of the VI. and X. Chapters. But doth not Lindwood here suppose ancient Infeodations of Tithes (at least created by Churchmen) in England? Doth he not thence fetch the originall of Portions belonging to Religious houses in England?
                     
commonly, though he writ as a Canonist, yet he addes the speciall custom of England if he speak of any Canon Law, which he thinks had not place here. but he excepts not England in this, but implies it. therefore doubtlesse, he supposed a common vse of ancient Infeodations among our Ancestors. but I doubt he had not better ground for it then what he found in others of his profession, that had rememberd the frequent vse of Infeodations in other States before that Councell. and he so applied it equally to his own Countrie, and with them takes the Infeodations to haue had originall only from the Grants of Church-men. therefore I value his testimonie here but as of a common Canonist, and not sufficient to satisfie vs touching our owne Countrie▪ neither in his age were the particulars of practice of the time before that Lateran Councell, or of the time of creation of Infeodations in other places, enough known among Lawiers. I adde only one note out of Bracton that may touch Tithes infeodated or turnd anciently here into Lay fee, and conclude this matter. He

                      speaking of Land demised and recouered by the Legatarie, tells vs some opinion was of his time, that such Land after the recouerie iterum incipit esse Laicum feodum & non ante; quod non erit de Decimis, cum semel efficiantur Laicum feodum; nunquam reincipient esse Decimae, & haec vera sunt secundum R. & alios. Did not he here

suppose Lay infeodations of Tithes in England? let the Reader iudge. By the way, I note, that passage is corrupted in the print. The beginning is Item for Iterum, and that R. & alios (which I think stands for Roger de Thurkelby a great Iudge of that time) is Biastos. but according to my Ms. Bracton, I haue thus alterd it. You may consider also if some Infeodations came not out of Lay mens enioying of whole Churches with their possessions about the Norman Conquest. it is frequent in Domesday, to find that such a Lay man tenet Ecclesiam of such a place, and sold it to such a one. and in the claimes of Yorkeshire there, the Entrie is super Ecclesiam S. Mariae de Moselege habet Rex medietatem eleemosynae festorum S. Mariae quae iacet ad Wackefeld. Omne aliud habet Ilbertus & Presbyter qui Ecclesiae seruit &c. Where Tithes were in that time annext by cōtinuance of payment or Consecration to Churches, perhaps they might in like manner as these Offerings or whole Churches, come into the Lay hands. but I leaue this to the iudgement of my Reader. And hereof thus much.
               
               
                  II.
                  Now for Exemptions or discharge from payment; we haue anciently had them here, and still retain some of them in the practiced Law. and that originally either by Priuileges, Prescription, or Grants and Compositions and Vnitie of possession. The Priuileges haue been either such as were specially allowd and limited to

the Orders of the Templars, Hospitalars, and Cistercians by the Generall Councell of Lateran, held in 17. of King Iohn (of which more particular narration is before made) or by new Bulls for the discharge of this or that Monasterie or Order, at the Popes pleasure. By reason of the first kind of priuilege, those three Orders held their Lands discharged of payment so long as they manured them in their own occupation. at least all such Lands as they had purchased before the Generall Councell. and by the second kind sometimes whole Orders were discharged, as for example, that Bull to the 
                        Innoc. 3. in Epist. Decret. lib. 1. pag. 20

                     Praemonstratenses in general giuen by Pope Innocent the third, grants them that of their own culture or other improuments they should pay none. Sometimes speciall Monasteries; as in that of the same Pope to the 
                        Ibid lib 2 pag. 410. Videsis Extr. tit. de Decimis c. 3. Ex multiplici.
                      Abbey of Chertsey. De noualibus verò quae proprijs manibus aut sumptibus colitis, aut de vestrorum animalium nutrimentis, siue de hortis & virgultis, aut piscationibus vestris, nullus à vobis Decimas exigere, vel extorquere praesumat, sed eas eleemosynae aut pauperibus Monasterij vestri iuxta quod tu fili Abbas postulasti à nobis, praecepimus assignari. What force by the common Laws of this Kingdom, such a Papall priuilege in ancient time alone had, I abstain here to dispute. and although other examples enough might out of originalls be brought of the like, yet I touch not any of them neither, lest vnawares I might giue

occasion of some priuat controuersie. But they had their force in the Canon Law here, and being so allowd in allegations against Libels for Tithes, were strengthened also at length (especially those which were of the ancientest) with prescription of time, in so much that from them originally diuers Lands of dissolued Monasteries remain to this day discharged of payment. But in 2. Hen. 4. cap. 4. an Act of Parliament is made against those of the Cistercians here, which purchased Bulls of Exemption for their demised Lands. and those of the Order and others putting such Bulls in execution are made thereby subiect to the punishment, containd in the Statut of 13. Rich. 2. of Praemunire. Discharges by immemoriall Praescription of paying no Tithes (of things commonly and of their nature titheable) nor any thing in lieu of them, are by the later common Law (since their Parochiall right established about the time of King Iohn) allowd only 
                        Voyez Rep. part. 2. fol. 44. & Fitzh. Nat. Br. fol. 42. 
                           •
                        . to spirituall persons, but to no Lay man. The Laitie being since that time held incapable of Tithes both by pernancie (sauing in such a speciall case where continuall consideration was giuen to the Church, as in that Case before of Herne and Pigot) in their own right, as also by discharge vpon bare prescription alone, sauing only in Cases within the Statuts of Dissolution of 31. Hen. 8. and 1. Ed. 6. and the Statut of 32. Hen. 8. that warrants common Infeodations

of them. and so is the practiced Law of this day. For, by those Statuts, lay Patentees of lands or Tithes haue like priuilege of discharge and title as the spirituall persons, whose Corporations were by them dissolued, before the dissolution enioied. Of the Hospitalars dissolued in 32. Hen. 8. I purposely abstain to speak. To this of Prescription, may be added that of Vnitie of Possession. For if any Religious house dissolued in 31. Hen. 8. held the Rectorie of Dale & Lands in the Parish immemorially paying no Tithes, this Vnitie discharges also the Patentees at this day, in such sort as the Monasteries were discharged. But by Compositions and Grants euery man, as well Lay as Spirituall, by the common Law (before the Statut of 13. of Elizabeth, made against Leases and Grants of Parsons) might be discharged of Tithes; as if the Parson Patron and Ordinarie ioind in it to the Parishioner either for consideration continuing (as in reall 
                        Regist. Orig. fol. 38. b. Fitzh. vbi supra.
                      Composition) or for other arbitrarie causes not appearing to posteritie as in Grants by all three, or rather in Grants by the Parson, and Confirmations by the Patron & Ordinarie. And it is prouided by the Statut of 2. Ed. 6. cap. 13. tha no person shall be sued or otherwise compelled to yeeld, giue, or pay any manner of Tithes for any Mannors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments which by the Laws and Statuts of this Realm, or by any Priuilege or Prescription are not chargeable

with the payment of any such Tithes, or that be discharged by any Composition reall. But although a Lay man may not be discharged of all payment by meer Prescription (vnlesse he begin the Prescription in a Spirituall person) yet for diminishing the Quota in payment only of a lesse then the Tenth, he may Vide lib. Intrat. non. rit. Prohibition §. 6. & Rep. 2. part. fol 44. prescribe, that is, De modo decimandi. and to that purpose an immemoriall custome of a whole Town or Mannor holds place at this day. So was the Law 8. Ed. 4. fol. 14. anciently also. Beside these discharges, some may here expect that part of our Laws, which with vs (as the Philippine in France, and the Carolines in Spain) discharge some things from payment of Tithes, and seem to permit some customs de non Decimando. But for that matter; so much as vpon consideration was thought fit to be sparingly said of it, is referd to the passages in the next Chapter, that touches ancient prohibitions de non Decimando. Neither indeed doth that part of our English customs belong to the title of Exemption or Discharge. for Exemption and Discharge are properly singular rights to this or that person or Land, and against the currant of the practiced Law. but those things touching which any such prohibitions de non &c. by our Law should be granted, are supposed generally according to the reasons and practice of the Laws of England, of their own nature, not titheable. So that not so much a discharge is found in

that course as a preuention of an vnlawfull charge which the Canons would lay vpon that which the Laws of the Kingdom account not at all in its own nature chargeable. But thereof somewhat more anon.

               AS a corollarie to the former parts that directly concerne the payment or consecration of Tithes, we thought fit to adde here in the Conclusion of the Treatise, the Historie also (but only the Historie) of the iurisdiction of Tithes in this Kingdom. It is cleer by the practiced cōmon Law, both of this day as also of the ancientest times that we haue in our yeer books, that regularly the iurisdiction of spiritual Tithes (that is, of the direct and originall question of their right) belongs, I thinke as in all other States of Christendom, properly to the Ecclesiasticall Court. and the later Statuts that haue giuen remedie for Tithes infeodated from the Crown after the Dissolution, leaue also the ancient right of Iurisdiction of Tithes to the Ecclesiastique Courts. But how the difference of Ages hath herein bin amongst vs, is litle enough known euen to them which see more then vulgarly. In declaration thereof, we shall aptly deuide the time tripartitly; into that of the Saxons; that from the Normans till about Henrie the second; and what intercedes from thence till this day.
               
                  
                  I.
                  In the Saxon times a iurisdiction of Ecclesiastique causes (among which you may reckon that of Tithes, although not much signe of it, in exacting payment of them, appears in the moniments of that age) was exercised iointly by the Videsis Leg. Et

Edgar and K. Knout, you see vpon default of paiment it is ordaind, that the Bishop and the Kings Bailife, or Shirife, with the Bailife of the Lord of the Land, should see that iust restitution should be made. particulars of the exercise of this kind of iurisdiction, I haue not seen. But at the Norman Conquest, this kind of holding Ecclesiastique pleas in the Hundred or Countie Court, was taken away. Remember that as at this day most of the Pleas Ecclesiastique are in the Ordinaries Court within the Diocese, so most suits in the secular or common Law were Viscontiel and held in the Countie or Hundred Court of the Shrife in those ancienter times, which may best be obserued out of one of the books of Ely

                      the most especiall moniment that is extant, for the holding of Pleas in the Saxon times. That alteration at the

                     Norman Conquest, was by a Law made by the Conqueror, and directed to all Tenants in the Diocese of Remy, that was first Bishop of Lincoln whither his See was then translated from Dorchester. and although it be sent in the direction by name to them only, yet it seems, it grew afterward to be a generall Law, no otherwise then the Statut of Circumspectè agatis, that hath speciall reference only to the Bishop of Norwich.

Which I rather transcribe here, because also it seems to giue the originall of the Bishops Cosistorie, as it sits with vs, diuided from the Hundred or Countie-Court, wherewith, in the Saxon time, it was ioyned.

                  Afterward, vnder the succeeding Princes, till about Henrie the second, it seemes, that the Iurisdiction of Tithes was exercised in both Courts, as well Secular as Spirituall, and that by originall suit; not only in the one by the first instance (as regularly the later common Law would haue it) and in the other by Prohibition only. I know, little proof will serue most men to iustifie, that the Spirituall Court had then a Iurisdiction of them. but also some testimonie I haue seen of a particular recouerie of Tithes in the Bishops Court in that age. The Monks of Northampton, vnder

King Stephen, recouered two parts of the Tithes of the demesnes of Wullaueston against Anselm de Cochis, before Robert Bishop of Lincoln, as Ordinarie. In plenaria Synodo coram Roberto Lincolniensi Episcopo disrationauerunt, as the words are in a sealed Charter of Simon the second, Earle of Northampton, then liuing; wherein hee testifies both the recouerie, as also Anselme's confirmation of the same two parts,

according to the recouerie, and addes also of his own volo & praecipio vt illam Eleemosynam habeant & teneant liberam & quietam. And to this you may adde the Appeales to Rome from the Audience of the Archbishop of Canterburie and other Ecclesiastique Conisans touching 
                        I. Sarisbur. epist. 21.84.92.109. & 133. Tithes, that are (as the ancientest Precedents of any such Ecclesiastique proceeding in England) remaining among the Epistles of Iohn of Salisburie, a great fauorite of Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterburie in the beginning of Henrie the second. In one of them it is obseruable by the way 
                        Idem Epist. 109., that one Richard, the Tenant of Land lying within the Parish of Lenham, being sued in the Audience by Andrew the Rector for his Tithes, alledges in Court, Sibi a nobili viro Willielmo fratre Regis, Domino suo, esse prohibitum, ne, eo absente, super Decimis de quibus agebatur, causam ingrederetur. Yet the Court ceased not therefore to proceed; but Sentence being readie to be giuen for the Rector, the Cause was sent to Rome, vpon the defendants Appeale. And although the 
                        Append▪ ad Concil Lateran. part. 47. cap. 5. title were only vpon the Grant of him that arbitrarily consecrated, yet was it somtime determined in the Spirituall Court. But also that in this elder age before about the time of Henrie the second, the Kings secular Courts of Iustice originally held plea of the right of Tithes, is as plain by infallible proofe of ancient Moniments. To begin with the eldest times of

this part of our Diuision; there remaines 
                        Chart. antiq. EE. 1 in Arce Londin.
                      yet recorded a Plea held apud Fulcardi montem, vnder William the second, betweene the Monks of Salmur and Philip de Braiosa; wherein, the Monks claiming against him and the Abbey of Fischamp (in Normandie) Parochiam quae ad Sanctum Cuthmannum pertinet de Castello de Staninges (these are in England, I thinke in Sussex) de Bedingas, & de Bedelingtona; by the testimonie of Robert Earle of Mellent, a Iudgement of the Conquerors time is cited, by which the Abbey of Fischamp had the Parish of S. Cuthmann adiudged to it in the Kings Court. And thereupon (it being denied by none) it was now again adiudged, that the Monks of Salmur should restore whatsoeuer they had taken post mortem Regis in Decimis & Sepulturis & Offrendis &c. to the Church of Fischamp. And while some delay was in the execution, the King sent his Writ ad Iusticiarios suos de Anglia, that is, to Ralf Bishop of Chichester, Randoll his Chaplaine, Hamon his Sewer, and Vrso de Abetot, whereby hee commanded, Vt facerent Ecclesiam S. Trinitatis (that is, of Fischamp) habere totam Parochiam S. Cuthmanni & Decimas & Corpora & omnes Custumas tam de viuis quam de mortuis sicut pertinebant ad praedictam Ecclesiam S.

The Shirife, by vertue of this Writ, vpon enquirie of the point of it in his Countie-Court, restored the Abbey to the possession of those Tithes.
The words of the Booke are, Cum verò per lectum esset Regis breue in pleno Comitatu & manifestè compertum totius Comitatus testimonio 
                           L. quòd. quoniam praefata Decima ad luminare Altaris S. Mariae pertineret, & quod eam Turstinus iniustè tenebat, Vicecomes ex parte Regis illum dissaisiauit, & eam Altari cui adiacebat restituit.
What can be plainer, then that in those times (if these examples haue credit, as indeed they cannot iustly be impeached) the Temporall Courts held Iurisdiction

of Tithes in point of right; and not only the Spirituall. and to confirm it, we adde also the autoritie of Iohn of Sarisburie 
                     
                        Epist. 159. that then liud. he in an Epistle to the Bishop of Excester relating some of those Positions of the common Laws; or the Auitae consuetudines (as they called them) which Thomas Archbishop of Canterburie about 12. of Hen. 2. so much withstood, mentions one to be Quod Laici, siue Rex, siue alius, causas de Ecclesijs & Decimis tractent. which well agrees with the autorities before cited. But this was vtterly disallowd then by the Pontificiall Laws, as, beside the autoritie of the common Canons, may be seen in an Epistle of Alexander the third, to the 
                        App. ad Concil. Lateran. part. 10. cap. 26. Bishop of Exceter and the Dean of Chichester, wherein it appears, that one William a Clerk of Chichester had appealed to the Pope about Tithes, the suit being twixt him and the Parson of Curket. and the Parson had on the other side appealed Ad audientiam Domini Regis. whereupon saies the Pope, Quoniam nemini liceat super rebus spiritualibus ad secularem Iudicem appellare, they should enquire of the matter, depriue the Parson, and send him to Rome.

                  The frequencie of such originall suits for Tithes, in the temporall Courts (through the Canons and the power of the Pope increasing, and growing more dreadfull to Henrie the second, and King Iohn) became about their times

to be, it seems, more out of vse, and possessed rather by Ecclesiastique iurisdiction. Neuerthelesse in the sundrie ages since, the determination of the right and payment of Tithes hath been subiect to the temporall Courts, by diuers kinds of originall proceeding, which for orders sake may be all comprehended in these Fiue.

By bare processe of command of payment. V. By the actions vpon the late Statuts of 32. Hen. 8. and 2 Ed. 6. For the first and last of these; because they are now both in common practice, and thence known enough in generall to euery man, I abstain purposely to speak more of them; sauing only that for the first; out of the more ancient ages, I obserue somwhat by the way which may belong to the vse of the present.

But, to leaue this and to go to the II. and III. and IV. courses of proceeding for Tithes in temporall Courts, which are not so obuiously known; for the II. touching the Writ of Right of Aduowson of Tithes, and the Indicauit. it hath bin cleer euer since the Statut of Westminster 2. cap. 5. and of Circumspectè agatis, both made in 13. Ed. 1. (this as well as the other long since being receiud into practice by the name of a Statut, and so called in Acts of Parlament; although it were anciently reputed rather as an Ordinance made 16. Ed 3. tit Jurisdiction 28. & See Cosius Apologie part. 1. pag. 57. &c. & Rot. Parlam. 25. Ed. 3. artic. 62. by the King and Prelats) that if A. Parson of Sale (for examples sake) libell against B. Parson of Dale in the spirituall Court, for so much Tithes and Offrings, possessed by B. as amount to the fourth or a greater part of the value of the Church of Dale, B. may haue him prohibited by an Indicauit directed to him and the spirituall Iudge, after which the Patron of A. hath no other remedie for himselfe or his Encumbent (what right soeuer they haue) then to bring a Writ of Right in the cōmon Pleas, of the Aduowson of that fourth part, against the Patron of B. in which Writ, the right of those Tithes must be tried by the

common Law. and herewith expresly agrees the Statut of Articuli Cleri. and the reason is because that if the determination of this Plea should be allowd to the spirituall Court, then might the Patrons Aduowson of such a part be there lost by iudgement according to the Canons, whereas the right of Aduowson and Patronage of Churches or Tithes only belongs, by our ancient Laws and at this day, to the secular Court. Neither is the Writ so much of the Tithes as of the Aduowson of the Tithes; Praecipe A. (so are the words) quod reddat B. aduocationem Decimarum tertiae vel quartae partis Ecclesiae de C. &c. And howeuer by the Canon Law the right of Tithes be meerly spirituall, and so not due to the Rector so much by reason of his presentation from the Patron, as of the common right challenged by the Ministerie (whereupon also

                     Lindwood, like a Canonist, thinks it not preiudicall to the Patron, which way soeuer the Tithes alone be determind of, in regard that all the Patrons interest is, hee saies, originally in the foundation, building, or endowing of the Church with Manse, Glebe, or Rent, and hath no relation to the Tithes which by common right are receiud without his Donation) yet by reason it seems both of our ancient practiced Law of Dotation of Churches by arbitrarie conueiances of Tithes, at the owners pleasure, in which doubtlesse Patrons very frequently Videsis Matth. Paris pag 716. lin. 40. encreased

the reuenues of foundations with the Tithes of their Demesnes; as also of that other ancient vse of Inuestiture, wherein the very interest of all the Glebe, Tithes annext▪ and other reuenues, was transferd into the Encumbent by the Patron; it was thought fit that the Aduowson of the Tithes alone should be equally reputed, for what concerned the Patron, with any other part of the Churches reuenue.

But, it is plain first, that long before those Statuts, Tithes were demandable, of the owner detaining them, of their own nature, and pleadable, in the Spirituall Court. and that affirmd in Fleta, was regularly

before true. Decimae

                     in quantum Decimae (it suits against the Parishioners) debent in foro Ecclesiastico intentari, wherewith Bracton, 
                     
                        Lib. 5. de Exceptionibus cap. 4. fol. 403. & cap. 10. fol. 407. liuing in the time of Henrie the third, also agrees. But it is as plain that before those Statuts, if the Rectors of two Churches of seuerall Auowries, had controuerted the right of a fourth part (or of the value of either of their Churches more) in Tithes, by suit commenced in the spirituall Court, the Patron of the Rector-defendant might haue had an Indicauit, to prohibit the prosecution and holding of the Plea. Bracton teaches vs that; and hath the forme of the Writ to the same purpose, and giues his reason, Quia posset Patronus, iacturam suae aduocationis incurrere. But somwhat doubtfully he limits the quantitie of the Tithes to the sixt part at the least, beyond which denomination the Indicauit, hee thinks, lay not for any part. His words are: Si contentio fuerit inter Rectores de aliquibus Decimis quae aestimari possunt vsque ad quartam, quintam, vel sextam partem aduocationis, vltra quam partem non extenditur prohibitio vt videtur, tunc fiat Iudicibus (Ecclesiasticis) Prohibitio in hac forma. Rex talibus Iudicibus salutem. Indicauit mihi &c. But he mentions no Writ of right of Aduowson of Tithes that should follow. Hee saies indeed that vpon the Indicauit, by consent only of the Patrons, there may be an enquest taken (the Iurie being returnd into Court by Venire facias or

                     Distringas had by petition of them so consenting) tanquam de Aduocatione, to find Vtrum talis praesentatus à tali Patrono recentèr fuerit in seisina de talibus Decimis tanquam spectantibus ad Ecclesiam suam quam tenet de praesentatione talis Patroni sui, vel si talis alia persona inde fuit in seisina tali tempore vt de Decimis spectantibus ad Ecclesiam suam talem quam tenet de aduocatione talis Patroni sui. But how euer Bracton's owne opinion (yet doubtfully) be, that the Indicauit might bee brought for the sixt part, and for no lesse, yet, it seemes, the practice of the age was otherwise. and that no determination was in his time, nor before 13. Edw. 1. of any certaintie therein; which is expressely deliuered in the Grieuances comprehended in the Nationall

By both which, compared with the ancient Bookes, it appeares, that the Kings Prohibition lay commonly, if the Aduowson of the Tithes were between two persons questioned, and that also (for aught occurres to the contrarie, except Bracton's coniecture) if any part of the Tithes or the Aduowson (which in such a suit were reputed as one) had been controuerted.

Accideret namque ratione consimili, omnem causam super possessionem vel quasi possessionē Ecclesiasticam inter duos Rectores duarum Ecclesiarum diuersorum Patronatuum emergentem, ne ventilaretur coram iudicibus Ecclesiasticis a domino Rege debere prohiberi; eo quod Actore in huiusmodi causa euincente, cōtinget semper Ecclesiam Rei imminui ac per hoc, secundum quod dicunt, Patronatum eiusdem deteriorari. Consequetur autem & sic quod huiusmodi causae Ecclesiasticae nunquam discindentur. A seculari enim iudice discindi non poterunt, neque ab Ecclesiastico iudice, obstante Regiâ prohibitione. Fortè autem nec consequitur quod in huiusmodi casu, euincente actore, imminuetur Patronatus alterius Ecclesiae. Non enim minus est Patronus qui minoris Ecclesiae est Patronus, sed nec minùs est pater qui minoris hominis est pater. Patronatus enim seu ius Patronatus non intenditur vel remittitur ex maioritate vel minoritate rei cuius est Patronatus. Praetereà sed tubera & ea quae contra naturam excrescunt in carne hominis non augent ipsum hominem, & medicinalis abscissio innaturalium huiusmodi excrementorum ipsum hominem non imminuit sed potius pulcrificat

& sanat. Ita iniustè possessiones & quasi possessiones Ecclesias ipsas non augent sed deturpant, & earum abscissio per iustum iudicium non est Ecclesiarum imminutio, sed potius pulcrificatio quaedam & sanatio; vnde & Patronatus seu ius Patronatus per huiusmodi abscissionem nullo modo potest imminui vel deteriorari, sed multò ampliùs emendari.
I faithfully relate it, and censure not the Arguments. You may doe that, Reader, while you smile at the Magis and Minus in it. But also, although the Indicauit prohibited the Spirituall Court, yet it seemes the Temporall, before the Statute of Westminster 2. and after the time of Henry the second, or thereabouts, held no Plea of right of Aduowson of Tithes, except only vpon Inquest taken by consent of both Patrons. something, as you see, might be tried in it. May we not conclude then, that the same Statut, in those words, Habeat Patronus Rectoris sic impediti breue ad petendum Aduocationem Decimarum petitarum, was the first Autor (at least after the change about the time of Henrie the second) of the Writ of Right of Aduowson of Tithes? Which also is well iustified by the pleading of the Abbot of Selbies case, within six yeeres after the Statute, wherein the parties (according to the fashion of argument in pleading of that time) agree, 
                        Platit. de Banco Pasch. 19. Ed. 1. rot. 45. 
                     Quod breue de quarta parte Decimarum primo locum habere caepit à tempore Statuti

Regis nunc apud Westmonasterium inde editi &c. Neither rests any scruple, touching the fourth part, why the Prohibition in the Indicauit and the Writ of Right, should bee of the fourth part only, or of a greater, although the Statute of Westminster 2. speak of no certaine part. For, that of Circumspectè agatis ordaines, That no Prohibition or Indicauit should lye, where the part controuerted is lesse then a fourth (it being before grantable vpon such suit for a sixt part, by Bracton's opinion; and it seems indeed, vpon suit for any part) and the Statute of Westminster the 2. giues the Writ of Right only where the Indicauit is first sued. And for this matter of Indicauit (which concernes properly suit between Rector and Rector, not between the Rector and the Parishioner) take as a note by the way the aduice of the Bishops among themselues in 41. Hen. 3. against the Temporall Courts. In the Annales of Burton it is extant, & thus speaks. Concilium Archiepiscopi & omnium Episcoporum super Articulis propositis apud London. Petit persona Ecclesiastica Decimas coram Iudice Ecclesiastico. Iudicanti & petenti porrigitur Regia Prohibitio nomine Patroni Ecclesiae cuius Rector conuenitur, ne super Aduocatione seu Patronatu Ecclesiae Iudex ille cognoscat; si actor prosequatur & Iudicantis officium

Aduocationis Ecclesiarum ad se trahere velint & de non prosequendo vlterius causam Decimarum in foro Ecclesiastico & Iudice siue a Parte securitatem exigunt, in nullo eis caueatur. Et si propter hoc aristentur, per loci Diocesanum requirantur siue per Episcopum proprium. Et si libere non tradantur Ecclesiae, competenti monitione praemissa excommunicentur Iudicantes & detentores. Et si queratur a Iudice quota pars vel quanta petatur, non respondeatur. But this aduice of theirs was to litle purpose, nor durst they, questionlesse, haue put it in execution. The Statuts of Westminster the 2. and Circumspectè agatis gaue them some remedie; whereof enough alreadie.
               
               
                  IV.
                  Of Writs of Scire facias, graunted to call men to answer in the Chancerie for Tithes, sufficient testimonie is in the Statute made for the Clergie in 18. Ed. 3. chap. 7. Item que per la ou briefs (so are the words) de Scire facias eient este grantez a garnir Prelates, Religieuses, & autres Clerks a respondre des Dismes en nostre Chancellarie & a monstre s'ils eient riens pur eux ou sachent riens dire pur quoy tielx Dismes a les demandants ne deuient estre restituees & a responder auxibien a nou
                           •
                         come a la partie de tielx Dismes &c. By this it appeares, that some vse was to graunt such Writs for Tithes. Whence also Fitzherbert well inferres, that the right of Tithes was determinable in the Kings Court. But wee haue not in our Yeere-Bookes any case

of further declaration of that vse before the Statute. But out of good ground you may coniecture, that in these Three speciall cases, Writs of Scire facias were grantable anciently for Tithes, and that in those times, before the Statut; either vpon the title of the demandant, first found by Inquest, to the Tithes, or returnd by the Shirife; or out of Fines, it seemes, leuied of Tithes; or vpon Patents of Tithes legally graunted by the King, when, against the Grant, any Clergie man by the Canon Law took them from the Patentee. Of all these, there is faire proof enough. But the third (it seems) hath principall reference to that Statute, as shall anon be shewed. For the course of taking an Inquest by commission, which being returnd, might be sufficient ground for a Scire facias, it appeares in Escaet. 8. Ed. 1. numer. 67. that a commission was sent to Adam of Eueringham, Steward of the Forest of Shirewood, to enquire by Oath of the Foresters and Verderors, whether the Priors of Lenton had vsed to haue all Tithes of the Kings Venison, taken in the Countie of Notingham, which they claimed per Cartas quorundam praedecessorum &c. And in the Inquisition returned, it is found, that they had vsed to haue it, and that first by the Grant of Videsis Rot. Claus. 21. Hen. 3. membran. 3. King Iohn. And in the same bundell, num. 72. a Commission is to Nicholas of Stapleton, commanding him to enquire, whether the Prior of Wyrkesep ought to haue the Tithes of all profits

of the Mannor of Gringeley; Nobis super iure Prioris in hac parte & facto contrario (that is, the subtraction of them by Henrie de Alemannia, against whom the Prior complaind) certiorari volentibus &c. Whereupon the Commissioner returnes, that the Priorie had right by prescription, and that Henry de Alemannia had subtracted them. What could be more proper, then to haue a Scire facias vpon the Inquisition, according to the intent of that preample of 18. Ed. 3. in which Scire facias, the right might be tried between the parties, and so iudgement be giuen? To these may be added that in Inquis. ad quod damnum 8. Ed. 2. num. 79. Where, per Petitionem 
                     Videsis Rot. Parl. 8 Ed. 2. rot. 23 
                     in Consilio, the Abbesse of Godestow hath a Writ directed Custodi equitij sui de Woodstock &c. which relates that ex parte dilectae nobis in Christo Abbatissae de Godestow per petitionem suam coram nobis in Consilio nostro exhibitam, nobis est ostensum quod cum per cartas 
                     Vide, si placet, Rot. Claus. 21. Haw. 3. membr. 19.

or falshood of the Plaintifes pretence, although indeed this example may serue also for that part of our diuision of this kind of proceeding which touches Patents. But to that Writ is annext the return, that is, the Bailifes acknowledgment in French of her right. his name is William Beauxamys. So in Escaet. 7. Ed. 3. num. 83. a Commission is sent out to enquire of the right of the Tithes of the Demesnes of the Kings Castle of Tikhull, which the Prior of S. Oswald claimed. the enquest was taken of it at Le Faure Okes, in the confines of Yorkeshire and Nothingham. and in it the particulars of the right are returned. and what should want, that vpon such returns, writs of Scire facias might not haue been granted. we omit that before cited out of the Parlament Rols of 18. Ed. 1.
                        Pat· 9. Hen. 3. part. 2. membr. 3. And light also to this practice in the temporall Courts of that elder time, may be had from other Cōmissions or Processe in the Rolls; as from that sent by Henrie the third into Ireland, to the Archbishop of Cassile, the Bishop of Ferne, and the Bishop of Lismore, commanding them, that, taking with them Ieffrey de Marisco then Iustice (or Lord Deputie) of Ireland, or some other whom hee should appoint, they should enquire by the Othes of both Lay and Clergie men, whether Bartholmew de Camera Parson of the Chappell of Limeric, or William of Caerdiff Treasurer there, had seisin of the Tithes, De Piscaria & Molendinis de Limeric,

                     tempore Ioannis Regis Patris nostri ante guerram motam inter ipsum & Barones &c. But it may be also that these Enquests or Returns made of the Title to Tithes by the Shrife, were only in case where the Tithes increased out of the Kings Demesnes, or perhaps immediat Tenancies. The examples seem not to go further▪ and in

                      6. Ed. 1. a Petition was exhibited in Parlament by one Piers a Chaplain of the Earle of Sauoy, against the Prior and Couent of Lewes, for a Tithe giuen him by the Prior and Couent in the Parish of Westun, in the Diocese of Ely, whereof another grant had been afterward made by them to one Richard de Meuton; and Piers beseeches the King to send his writ to the Shrife of Cambridge, to put him in possession; but this answer is indorsed. Rex non intromittit se de hijs quae talitèr spectant ad forum Ecclesiasticum; sed prosequatur Ius suum versus Clericum qui tenet Ecclesiam, coram Ordinario. Here was an expresse exclusion of the Temporall iurisdiction in such a case, where an originall Writ or Commission was commanded to setle or inquire of the right of Tithes, that toucht only common persons. But wheneuer through such means the title appeared vpon record, I vnderstand not why a Scire facias might not aswell be issuable (although I haue not met with an expresse example of that kind) as in the last course that is vpon the title appearing in Patents of the King or his Ancestors.
               
               
                  
                  V.
                  For that second ground of Writs of Scire facias, which we suppose to be Fines, leuied of Tithes; why was it not as likely that vpon such Fines leuied, Writs of Scire facias should lie as vpon any others of Lands or Rents. and that Fines of the right of Tithes were in the Kings Courts anciently leuied, is manifest: not as I remember vpon Writs of Couenant, which yet may (for aught I know) at this day be brought, in the temporall Court, for spirituall 38. Ed. 7. fol. 8. & Regist. Orig. fol. 165. Tithes, in regard no Tithes but damages are only to be recouered; but chiefly in Writs of Right of Aduowson. For example, In Fin. Trinit. 10. R. Iohannis Wilt. apud Windlesore coram ipso Rege, Simone de Pateshulle, Iacobo de Poterna, Henrico de Audemero Iusticiarijs & alijs Domini Regis fidelibus tunc ibidem praesentibus.
vpon a Writ of right of Aduowson brought by Ascelina Abbesse of Wilton, against Henrie of Abeny for the Patronage of the Chappell of the greater Wicheford, the concord is, that the Abbesse grants it to him in Fee, sauing a pension of two shillings yeerly to the Church of Neweton, being a Prebend of Wilton. 
                     Et pro hac recognitione & quieta clamatione & fine & concordia idem Henricus remisit & quietum clamauit de se, & haeredibus suis praedictae Abbatissae & Ecclesiae sanctae Edithae Virginis in Wilton, & eiusdem loci conuentui, all his right in certain Lands, & recognouit & concessit omnes Decimas

de Dominico suo in maiori Wicheford, esse pertinentes ad praedictam Ecclesiam de Neweton, quae est Praebenda de Wilton sicut eas habere solet, excepta Decima bladi proueniente ex viginti acris terrae quas persona praedictae Capellae elegerit de Dominico ipsius Henrici. quam Decimam persona per Henricum praedictum, vel haeredes suos ad praedictam Capellam de Wicheford praesentata, & admissa per visum personae quae praedictam Praebendam de Niweton habuit, vel per visum balliui eius debet recipere in autumno, sicut ab antiquo recipere consueuit.
The record is worthy of speciall obseruation. And in the Leiger book of the Priorie of Merton in Surrey, a Fine is of Pasch. 12. R. Ioh. before the King and the same Iustices, between William de Cantelupo Defendant, and Walter Prior of Merton, vpon the right of Aduowson of the Church of Eyton, wherein it is agreed that the Chaplain of the demandants in Eyton, shal not take à parochianis eiusdem Ecclesiae nec in Decimis, nec in Oblationibus, nec in Confessionibus &c. but leaue them all to the Parish Church of Eyton. and in this, some may, as in the other, note the pretended interest of the Patron, in disposition of any of the Reuenues of the Church. which anciently claimed, while Inuestitures continued, was not as yet omitted in these Legall proceedings or instruments, that is, Fines; which are of greatest curiositie.

and according hereto is a Fine of 7. Rich. 1. leuied between the Prior of Stanes and Alice Hopton, of the Aduowson of the Church of Cheklegh in Staffordshire, where Alice as Patronesse grants to the Priorie, among other things, Omnes Decimas villae de Northmankote in perpetuum quae est de eadem Parochia, that is of Cheklegh. and in the 
                        In Bibl. Cotton.
                      Chartularie of Gisburn, in a Fine of 23. Hen. 3. between Peeter de Bruis plaintif, and Iohn Prior of Gisburn (in the Prouince of York) defendant, In droit d'Aduowson, Peeter grants vt ius suum omnes Decimas superscriptas quas &c. The like also doth he in a Fine of 26. Hen. 3. there transcribed. and in 30. Hen. 3. also, of which more particular mention is before made.
               
               
                  VI.
                  But for Writs of Scire facias brought vpon the third ground, that is, in Case where the title appears vpon record in Patents made of the Tithes from the King or his Predecessors; take this speciall example of 17. Ed. 3.
A Writ was directed to the Shrife 
                        Fascicul. Bren. de 17 Ed. 3. part. 1. & 3. in Arce Londin. of Essex, relating that Maude, Quondam Regina Angliae, granted to the Deane and Canons of the Kings free-Chappell of S. Martins in London, the Churches of Witteham and Chersinges, Cum Capellis & Decimis &c. and that they were thereof and of the Tithes of Witteham and Cheresinges, seised till 16. Ed. 2. and that since the Abbot of Saint Iohns of Colchester took from them two parts of the Tithes &c. Et quia nos omnia & singula

Iunij anno regni nostri 17. Per Regem & Consilium.
This Writ was returnd with Scire feci by H. Garnet Shrife of Essex, and by consent of the parties it is referd to Mihelmas Terme following In Statu pro nunc. the Writ is both in part 1. and 3. of that yeer, but to that in part 3. which is of Trinitie Terme, a Plea of the Abbots is annext in these words. Et praedictus Abbas per atturnatum suum dicit quod praedicti Decanus & Capitulum per breue suum non supponunt quod Ecclesiae de Witteham & Cheresinges sunt de fundatione dictae liberae Capellae Domini Regis, sed quod illas Ecclesias tenent de dono Matildae quondam Reginae

Angliae post fundationem dictae liberae Capellae, & dicit quod tempore doni, praedictae Ecclesiae fuerunt in iurisdictione ordinariâ videlicet Episcopi London. & continuè post donum hucusque fuerunt & ad huc sunt in praesenti in iurisdictione ordinaria. Et dicit quod praedictae Ecclesiae fuerunt visitabiles & visitatae per Episcopos London. in visitationibus suis à tempore à quo memoria non extat. & praedicti Decanus & Capitulum per breue suum petunt decimas quas supponunt esse parcellam earum Ecclesiarum quae sunt in iurisdictione Ordinaria in forma praedicta, & sic Decimae illae sunt merè spiritualia & non placitabilia nisi in curia Christianitatis; per quod non intendit quod Curia ista in hoc casu cognitionem habere debeat.
Here it appeares, that the Counsell of the Abbot of Colchester Defendant, supposed that the conisans of the Tithes was spirituall only, vnlesse they were originally part of the Kings free Chappell. how the Case was determined, appears not. But in the next Parlament following was a Petition exhibited by the Clergie in those words before cited §. IV. complayning of the granting of such Writs of Scire facias, and vpon that Petition the King answered, Que tielx breifs desore nauant ne soient grantes, & que les Proces pendant sur tielx breifs soient anentes & que les parties soient dismisses deuant secular Iudges de tielx manner de Plees salue

a nous nostre droit tiel come nous & nostre ancestors auoient ewe & soloient auer de reson. I think we need not doubt but that this very Case of the Abbot of Colchester was no small cause of that Petition of the Clergie. and you see mention is, in the answer, of some Writs hanging, whereof this is most likely to haue been one. But howeuer the Petition was answered, and although out of this Petition and answere that Act of 18. Ed. 3. hath been receiud among our Statuts, and commonly goes for one, yet might it deserue further consideration then I will here seem to take of it. only I admonish that within foure yeers after, a Scire facias was 22. Assis. pl. 75. brought by a Patentee of Tithes in the Forest of Inglewood, and that against a Prior being Pernor of them; and by iudgement the Writ was allowd without mention or the least regard had of that Act. why that was so, or what force the Act hath, let others examin; I purposely abstain.
               
               
                  VII.
                  But for Processe of bare command of payment of Tithes, or the like; when the title was by Patent cleerly supposed true, the Shrife or other Officer was sometimes commanded by Writ to take order that the demandant might enioy his Tithes. As in Claus. 7. Hen. 3. part. 1. membran. 6. the King directs his Writ to Brian de Insula Keeper of the Forest of Shirewood, telling him, that pro salute animae Domini Ioannis Regis patris nostri concessimus Monachis

de Basingwere, quod percipiant hac vice vsque ad Festum S. Michaelis Anno regni nostri VII. Decimas de bladis seminatis in defenso nostro inter Blakebroc & Glossop, & ideo vobis mandamus quod ipsos Monachos hac vice sine impedimento permittatis Decimas praedictas percipere. T. &c. And such more somtimes occurre. But this, and the most of that age that are of this matter, indeed appeare to haue bin of Tithes in a Forest also, as that of 22. Ed. 3. is in the Booke of Assises (which happened after the Statute of 18. Ed. 3.) and you may remember those before cited out of 6. Ed. 1. and 18. Ed. 1. in Chapter XI. §. III. and the example of 8. Ed. 2. before rememberd touching Woodstock Parke. So in Rot. Claus. 5. Hen. 3. part. 2. membr.. 14. the Bishop of Salisburie hath his fiftie shillings yeerely nomine Decimae, out of New-Forest (which 
                        Cart. Antiq. CC. in dors. 10. in Arce Lond. 
                     Henrie the second had granted to his Church by the name of omnes Decimas de Noua Foresta &c.) and other like out of other, paid him by Writ to the Sherife; and in Rot. Pat. 11. Hen. 3. membrana 5. part. 1. Eustace Bishop of London hath the Tithe of the Kings Venison, taken in the Forest of Essex, (according to King 
                        Rot. Chart. 6. R. Ioh. membr. 12. ch. 107. 
                     Iohns Graunt) by Writ directed to the Foresters and Bailifes of that Countie. Neither would they (it seemes) in that age permit any suit for the Tenths of Venison or Beasts of the Forest in the Spirituall Court,

(although those Tenths were most commonly setled in one Church or another by Grant) as may be seen in 
                        In Arce Londin.
                      
                     Mich. 9. & 10. Hen. 3. Rot. 15. where Iohn Fitz-Robert, in an Attachment vpon a Prohibition against Philip of Ardern Clerk, in the pleading allows, that for Tithe of Hay and Mills, the prosecution in the Spirituall Court was lawfull; but hee further sayes, that de Decima Bestia Forestae eum implacitauit contra prohibitionem &c. And herewith may be considered also the Kings 
                        Pat. 
                        
                           •
                        6. Hen. 3. membr. 7. command, sent to the Constable of Windsore Castle, that the Church of Saint Iohn in Windsore should haue Decimas Gardini Regis de Windleshores. But out of these all (as out of the examples before brought of Commissions to be returned) it may perhaps be collected, that only the Tithes of the Kings lands, or belonging to his Churches, were to be ordered or commanded to be paid by these kind of Processes. I confesse I haue not seene enough to perswade me otherwise, for the time after about King Iohn or his neere predecessors. Yet, that as I leaue the iudgement of all, which historically I relate to the able Reader, so I may not defraud him of what in any kind may giue light; here I offer him also this Writ of 24. Hen. 3. that seems to touch the temporall Courts determination of the right of such Tithes, as, for aught appears, belonged neither to the Kings Churches, nor were encreasing

in his Demesnes or immediat Tenancies. Henricus Dei gratia Rex

            A REVIEW.
            AFter some few Copies, thus halfe printed and halfe writen, were dispersed, and since the various Censure of vnequall Readers, (some of them cauilling at such Passages in it, as the Autor at first thought, and not without cause, had been enough cleered) this short Reuiew is now added; wherein, beside some other Confirming and Declaring Autorities, by the way also, and opportunely enough, occurre some Admonitions briefely offered, that may somewhat direct in the Vse of this Historicall truth. The printed sheets could not be encreased, or altered. neither was it so fit, after many hands had the whole, that Additions inserted, should make any variance from the writen part. And plainly, that of the Admonitions, for direction in the Vse, of its own nature rather required a seuerall place, then was fit to haue been mixt in the bodie of the Historie. In the name therefore of Goodnesse and Learning, I earnestly beseech euery one, that hereafter shall get it either Copied or Printed, to ioine also (if hee may) this Reuiew with it.

And beside the generall name of Tithes of all, reasons are drawn for their side out of those words of the Patriarch to the King of Sodom; I will not take of all that is thine so much as a thred &c.

Hierome, that were it not for the holy autoritie of the Epistle to the Ebrews, it might stand indifferent whether Abraham gaue Tithes of the spoiles to Melchisedek as to a Priest, or Melchisedek the Tenth of his estate to Abraham, as a portion to one of his posteritie. If there be a fault in that assertion (I confesse I find none) let them be so bold then as to tax those learned Fathers for it, S. Hierome and

And beside such interpretation of the context, the Chronologicall part of the holy Storie affords much to proue, that Sem was not the first-borne in time. For Noah was 
                  
                     Genes. 5.32. 
                  D. yeeres old, and got Sem, Ham, and Iaphet. Sem

                  Noah, Sems age was only C. yeeres. Then at Sems birth, Noah was D.II. yeere old. Who euer therefore was borne when he was but D. yeers of age, must be C.II. yeers old, when Sem had seene only one C. yeeres. If any of them were borne in Noahs D. yeere (as the Text seemes to teach) it must then be one of the other two, and not Sem. This argument, vsed by the Iews and others, which follow them here, ioind with what is in the

                  Septuagint for Iaphet, makes so much against Sem's being the first born, that howeuer the great Ioseph Scaliger be

Some will haue Ham. But I leaue that matter; supposing cleerly that Sem being Melchisedek (for, that one man should be denoted by seuerall names, is no noueltie in Scripture) was either the first born or had the right of it transferd into him by speciall blessing, and so was

Hieroms time, was as now also of greatest Diuines, that Salem here and Ierusalem were the same. Salem nostri omnes, saith he and others of that age that follow him, arbitrantur esse Ierusalem. but himselfe was not of that mind, hauing as hee saith, learned the contrarie. But also, with those old Christians, Iosephus and some later Vide Midras Tehillim, apud Gaelatin. de Arcanis lib. 3. cap. 9. 
                  Iews expresly agree. and a good character of the truth of their opinion is in the holy Text. For, there the Kings Dale, whence the King of Sodom came out to meet Abraham in his return is 
                     Genes. 14.17. rememberd, as if it were close by where Melchisedek was. Now it is thought certainly that the place of Absalons Pillar, that is, the Kings Dale spoken of in 2. Sam. 18.18. 
                  Samuel, is no other then a Valley, which being hard by Ierusalem, is known to our age from Absalons name, where yet, they

               Of the II. Chapter.
               HEtherto could I neuer see any Christian that hath fully taught what was considerable in the generall payment of Tithes among the Iews. The Noble and most learned Ios. Scaliger, did not euery way enough accuratly teach it, although in a single Treatise he purposely vndertook it. How sufficiently among vs, others do that slouthfully and ignorantly (without his help) while yet their end

is to write of Tithes, talke of a third Tithe here, and a fourth Tithe, and indeed they know not what Tithe, let him iudge that shall hence know their error. This last spring Martin the Title page of Drusius his Obseruations vpon Iosuah, and some other parts of the old Testament, a new discourse, De Decimis Mosaciis, writen by Sixtinus ab Amama Professor of Ebrew in Franeker, was promised; but I could neuer yet see any such thing ioind with that of Drusius or otherwise published. What we haue of them is as the great Doctors of the Iews haue deliuered in the Talmud, and their later Comments; which are testimonies beyond exception, for the practice or historicall part. For that in §. 6. of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , out of Epiphanius; I rather think indeed that it denotes only a paying of Tithe, not a Tithing of what was alreadie tithed. It is well known that the language of the Greek Fathers, especially of about his time, is frequently mixt with phrases of the Septuagint. now they 
                     Genes. 28. vlt. Deut. 26.12. haue 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   & 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , for nothing but to pay a Tithe, which agrees somwhat with the Ebrew fashion of expression. and as they, so Epiphanius without doubt vnderstood it. howeuer some of great Names are of another mind. But to what is there toucht for the forwardnesse of payment of first Fruits among them, I here adde out of 
                     Lib. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  Philo (who liued vnder the time of the second Temple, and spake of his own knowledge) that they were paid in such abundance, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, that euen from the abundance only of first Fruits, heaue Offerings, or Therumahs, which were paid by the owner immediatly to the Priests, there was not a Priest in the XXIV. courses of them (so the Priests or Posteritie of Eleazer & Ithamar were deuided 1. Paralip. 24.4. by King Dauid) but might be accounted a very rich or largely furnisht man. and he tells vs further that the Iews were so readie in paying them, that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, They preuented the Officers demanding them, paid them before they were due by Law, and as if they had rather taken a benefit then giuen any, both sexes of their own most forward readinesse in euery first fruit season brought them in with such courtesie and thanks-giuing as is beyond all expression. All which is spoken only of first Fruits and Therumahs, not of Tithes, as it is falsly in the Latin translation; where 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   alone is ignorantly vnderstood for Tithes paid by the Laitie to the Priests; the truth being that the Laitie paid only first Fruits, not Tithes, immediatly to the Priests, but only to the Leuits, that is, those which were, as Philo saies, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, in the second rank, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or as Wardeins, Huishers, Singers, and other such Ministers. And the Leuits paid the Tithe of their Tithe to their Priests, who so through the Leuits receiud Tithes

out of the possessions of the Laitie, as also the holy Autor to the Ebrews is interpreted, where he saies, That those of the sonnes of Leui that had receiud the Priesthood, had a commandement to take Tithes of the people according to the Law. For the posteritie of Aaron that had the Priesthood, receiud none from the people, but immediatly and through the Leuits. In the same holy Epistle their continuance of paiment of Tithes (which as long as their Priesthood de facto, and the politique form of gouernment, instituted by the Almightie, continued, was euen ex conscientia to be performed, as some Videsis Suarez de L

The Iews are told in it, that here men that die receiue Tithes, but there he of whom it is witnessed that he liueth. That here, being plainly referd to the vse of the Iews (to whom the Epistle was sent) vnder the second Temple. So Primasius an old African Father interprets it. Hic inquit, saith he, hoc est in praesenti seculo, vel in Templo quod adhuc stabat, Morientes homines, filij videlicet Leui qui mortales ac moribundi sunt, Decimas accipiunt. But about this time also it appears in Storie that Tithes were still paid by the Leuits to the Priests, which supposes the peoples paiment to the Leuits. Remember that of Fl. Iosephus 
                  
                     Archaelog. lib. 20. cap. 6. where he tells, that when Foelix was Lieutenant of Iudea, such a tumult and sedition happend twixt the high Priests (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) and the rest of the Priests, and the chiefest of the Laitie▪ that the high Priests to satisfie their malice vpon the rest of the Priests, violently took away the Tithes that were kept in Granges and Barnes for their maintenance, and in so much wronged them that some of the poorest of them euen died for want. This was about the beginning of Nero; and

                  Nicephorus relating it from Iosephus, refer it to him. although Ruffinus in his translation of Eusebius rather place it vnder Claudius. but vnder both, Foelix was Lieutenant. By the way you may note that in Nero's time, diuers of the Priests were grown much poorer then they had been lately before; if Philo be to be credited, who liued also but litle before Nero's Empire. It was very hard with some of them (it seemes) that the taking away their Tithes only should starue them. Those high Priests here spoken of, are such as were the chiefest of the XXIV. Orders. for 1. Paralip. 24 4.5 so also were the Priests deuided. There was neuer but one high Priest properly, and that according to the first institution. but others that had a supremacie among those orders, were also called so, as both heere, and in Vide D. Matth. 20.57. & 59. holy Writ. and they were, to the high Priest, as the

                  Paschasius long since fell into about what follows out of Saint Matthew, in the 7. §. where the strict payment of Tithes vsed among the Scribes and Pharisees is spoken of. He being too ignorant of the particulars of the Iewish state, doubted much how the Scribes and Pharisees should so pay their Tithes, Cùm ipsi (as his words are) Sacerdotes erant & Leuitae qui magis accipiebant Decimas à populo quam darent. But I wonder what made him so much as dream so. indeed he answers himselfe also. But plainly the Scribes and Pharisees, as known by that name only, had no more reference to the Tribe of Leui then to any other of the Twelue. Children in the holy Text or the Iewish storie, know it.

Whereupon one notes, that at this day qui religiosiores sunt inter Iudaeos, loco Decimarum, eleemosynam pendunt de omnibus Lucris; decem aureos de centum, centum de mille &c. But howeuer the deuouter of them may giue such almes, it is plain that their Legall Tithing hath now no place among them for want of a sufficient Priesthood and Temple or Tabernacle. yet without doubt, most of them haue long since exspected a Videsis Galatin. de Arcanis▪ lib. 5. cap 9. third Temple. otherwise why were they so carefull to haue their Laws and speciall cases of first Fruits and Tithing, so copiously deliuered in fiue whole Massecheths of their Talmud, or body of their Ciuill and Canon Law, which was, many yeers after the destruction of the second Temple, made for the direction of the dispersed of their Nation?
               Now, me thinks, he that argues for Tithes from the Mosaicall

Laws of Tithing had need more specially, then any I haue yet seen hath neer done, examine which of the two kinds are due in the Euangelicall Priesthood. Why not the second aswell as the first? and further consider also how the paiment of Tithes from the Laitie to the Priests of the Gospell, succeeds to the paiment from the Leuits to the sonnes of Aaron. But these considerations can only be, where the knowledge of fact precedes, for without exact Distinction of their seuerall Tithes, any argument drawn from them, may soon be found a grosse fallacie, that may both deceiue him which makes it and those whom he teaches. Let the ingenuous Reader thinke of it.
               But one thing more here by the way. So much either ignorance or neglect in the disquisition of what belongs to the Tithes of the Iews, hath possest some great names, that, touching the proportion of the Tithes and the Receiuers, they haue rested fairely satisfied in this; that the Leuits being one of the twelue Tribes, had the Tenths as a competent maintenance to themselues, being neer the Tenth, that is, being the twelfth part of the people; as if Arithmetically the People and the Reuenues had been so deuided. But others haue long since easily shewd the slightnesse and falshood also of this fancie. And cleerly, had such a ne
                     •
                  r proportion of persons and the name of Tenth held; yet examine all that was paid to the Priests and Leuits in first Fruits and the seuerall prediall Tenths only, and it will be neer a fift. and we here omit also the Cities and Suburbs assigned to them, and their other many profits out of Sacrifices, ransoms of First-born, and the like. But for that proportion of number twixt the Tithes, wee haue sufficient testimonie in holy

Writ, that it was farre otherwise The able men for armes of the eleuen Tribes were numberd to 603550. and these all of XX. yeers old at least. the Males of the Leuits from a month old were seuerally found to be but 22273. for so are the particulars of the Families of Gershon, K

Here then the Leuits reckond, with aduantage of all their Male children of aboue a month old, make not a 1/27. of the rest of the Tribes. had the rest been accounted also with all their Males of like age, it is probable enough that the Male Leuits would not haue equalled a fiftieth or sixtieth part. as in the one sex of them, the coniecture may also be in the other. and afterwards likewise Vide 1.

Where then is any thing towards proportion twixt the number of the Priests and Leuits, and the denomination of the Tithe? Neither is it to any purpose or consequent to look after any such thing. I rest in this; that it pleased the Almightie so to enrich that Tribe, which was reserued only for the holy Seruice in the Temple. Why he did so, or with what proportion, let them, for me, examine, who dare put their prophane fancies to play with his holy Text, and so most impudently and wickedly offer to square the one by the other.

               IN it, largely out of originall Autors of Greece and Rome, is shewd the vse of Tithing among the Gentiles. farre more largely then by any that hath yet toucht it. The truth also, wherein too many are either obstinatly or ignorantly blind, touching that of their supposed generall paiment, collected out of a corrupted place in Festus, or rather in Paulus Diaconus, is declared and brought to its own limits. neither will any iudicious Reader doubt of the corruption of Festus in that place. whosoeuer knows but the fashion of his writing (which must be obserued in that of his own, after the XI. book, partly yet remaining in his very words) cannot at all think that Decima quae

                     . But it was no such wonder that Paulus Diaconus, who ignorantly abridged him vnder Charles the Great, should say so; being, as the learned acknowledge him, no small enemie to posteritie, in so cutting and maiming him. he was (saies

                   the noble Scaliger) Homo meo iudicio confidentissimus ac, vti res ipsa decet, ineptissimus. Had he delt with Festus, as Festus did before with Verrius Flaccus, it had been tolerable. though by Festus perhaps we haue lost much of Flaccus, yet he appears iudicious enough and carefull in what he deliuers from him. But this Paul (being, I confesse, otherwise a man of great reading and knowledge for the time he liud in) hath not only here by coniecture, but in other places most plainly so exprest things of this nature, that is, touching the Theologie or Rites of the Gentiles, that, had we not found some pieces of Festus himselfe, posteritie might haue been perpetually blinded by him. No man will denie it that obserues but his words, Maleuoli, Nixi Dij, Praeclamitatores, Nauia, and diuers other which, compard with what is left of Festus whence he had them, appeare to bee either mistaken or falsly deliuered. But for the Gentiles; it is true, they were very deuout in giuing of their yeerly increase to the honor of their Deities, according as the Attique Law receiud, as is thought, from Triptolemus, and seconded by

But the paiment of that vow was commonly in feasts made in honor of him; and those feasts were, it seems, in ancienter time, vntill the Vow was performd, celebrated within euery ten daies by such as were so religious to him. and in that diuision of time, for the more conuenience of entertainment, his Tithe was merrily spent; and the guests alwaies sent home crownd with Baies in honor of him.

him chiefly as he was their God of Warre or of Defence. For it is cleer not only in the old Roman Diuinitie or Mythologie, that Hercules specially was accounted Mars (as is plain by their Moniments, which shew that the institution of Sacra Saliaria were indifferent to Hercules or Mars, and made to one Deitie vnder those two names) but also by the old Astronomie wherein the Planet Mars was likewise called

But now see (when you truly know the ancient Tithing among the Gentiles) how well they conclude here that draw arguments from the generall Law of Nature or Nations, as if by that Law any such vse of paiment of Tithes had been established among them, as was continuall or compulsorie.
            
            
               
               Of the IV. Chapter.
               THat which succeeds is only of Christian Practice, Laws, and Opinion. Which, any man that sees but the course of our diuision, may easily know; though he were as peruerse as he was that to confute me in assertion here of no proof of paiment of Tithes, till towards the end of the first CCCC. yeers, confidently brought that Text of the holy Autor to the Ebrews, 
                  
                     Ad Ebraeos cap. 7.8. 
                  Here men that die, receiue Tithes: and was readie to sing decidit in casses &c. as if that had proued a paiment in the Apostles time. indeed it proues a paiment among the Ebrews or Iews then, and also is seconded by other autoritie before touched. but any reference there had to ā Christian practice of Tithing, I suppose no man will affirm that is of a sound brain, and vses holy Writ with due reuerence. But my application of some passages in S. Cyprian in §. 1. here are found fault withall; in that I vnderstand not hi
                     •
                   mention of the word Decimae to be a note of paiment of Tithes in his age. Indeed I did not think that any man which vnderstood Cyprian, with the vse of his time in making vp the Ecclesiastique Tresure, would haue therin taxed me. Neither haue I giuen his words alone & then my own Glosse (as many haue done too often, and that in things of the nature of this subiect, and so haue deceiud their credulous Readers) but I haue carefully and shortly exprest also the occasion of his passages; and so, that an vnderstanding Reader may collect as much out of them as he might do if he had the whole context of Cyprian by him. If I haue errd in the interpretation, it is but my single error and theirs that dare giue autoritie here to my iudgement. whoeuer can think otherwise by Cyprians words, if he saw him, may equally do so by my relation. howeuer then, I impose not on any Reader. But for that second place of his out of his De Vnitate Ecclesiae; obserue his words more fully. Thus they are, Domos tunc & fundos venundabant &, thesauros sibi in coelo reponentes, distribuenda in vsus indigentium pretia Apostolis offerebant. At nunc patrimonio nec Decimas damus; & cum vendere iubeat Dominus emimus potius & augemus. So farre is this from denoting any paiment of Tenths of annuall increase (which is the Tithe we enquire after) that indeed no such Tenth seems here to be vnderstood in the mention of Decimae. he speaks of them which sold their whole estates in the Apostles times. but now, saith he, we giue not the Tenths of our patrimonies. that is, we giue not the Tenth part of what deuout Christians then did, but in stead of selling for deuotion, we buy and increase our estates. What other Tenth is here spoken of then the tenth part of euery mans patrimonie or estate? and what hath that to do with the tenth of Annuall encrease only? and, for any vse of paiment in this time: I was not so bold to make the negatiue, that no Tithes were paid, but that it could not be proued that any were.
                  
He that can shew me aught omitted that might proue it, shall deserue and haue thanks of me. In the meane time further to iustifie what I affirme, take this of Epiphanius Bishop of Constance in Cyprus, that about the yeer CCC.LXXX. wrote against the Heresies of the primitiue times. when he

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, they do all things or agree generally with the Church, sauing that they were too much herein addicted to the Iew
                        •
                     sh custome. and in his argument against them, he shewes, that the curse hath not reference only to the Passeouer, but also to Circumcision, to Tithes (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) to Offerings. Wherefore (as he goes on) if they escape one curse, by keeping their Easter according to the Law of the Passeouer, they thrust themselues into many other. For (saith he) they shall find them also cursed that are not Circumcised, and them cursed that pay not Tithes, and them cursed that offer not at Ierusalem. Let any man now consider if this Bishop that was least vnacquainted with the customes of the Christian Church, vnderstood not cleerly that no necessarie or knowne vse of paiment, was among Christians in his time, of Tithes, no more then of Circumcision, or offering at Ierusalem. Doth he not plainly reckon it as a thing not only not in Christian vse, but euen equalls it with what was certainly abrogated? is not his Obiection shortly thus? Why do you not obserue Circumcision and Tithing, and Offerings also at Ierusalem, which are all subiect to the like curse? and because some kind of Offerings indeed were in vse among Christians, therefore in the Obiection he prouidently ties them to Ierusalem. But of Tithing he speakes as generally as of Circumcision. Obserue his owne context, which I here giue, that the able Readers iudgement may be free. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     e also accursed (in the old Law) that offer not at Ierusalem. I confesse, this may perhaps seem not to extend to the African Church (wherein S. Cyprian and S. Augustine liued) that was farre remote from Epiphanius, being of the Greek Eastern Church▪ and so not to sufficiently proue that in those times no paiment was in vse there. The like perhaps may be obuiously thought of in referring it to the Westerne Church of Europe. But it seemes that the African, European, & Eastern Greek Churches of those times, had litle or no difference twixt them in the setled policie for their maintenance. And for the African; howeuer out of S. Augustines Sermons it may be collected,

that a paiment soone afterward was there in vse, yet herein both the Greek Eastern, and the African Churches are specially so like each other, that neither in the Councells or Canons of the one or the other of them, any Law at all is found for paiment or ordaining any thing touching Tithes; nor as I remember, doth the name of Tithes once occurre in them, or in Photius his Nomocanon, or in Zonaras, or Balsam

But it had been litle to the purpose indeed to haue had Tithes of Annuall increase paid, while that most bountifull deuotion of good Christians continued in frequent Offerings, both of lands and goods to such large value, as you see exprest in that of the Gouernor of Rome to S. Laurence (being Archdeacon to Pope Xistus the second) in the ninth persecution vnder Decius. He tells him

no doubt can be but that the Gouernor is here made to speake somewhat beyond the truth. But also questionlesse the liberall deuotion of the time was very exceeding in offerings.
               But, for Constitutions of this age; lest we should seeme to omit any thing that beares the name of one, although meerly supposititious, we shall here adde more to that cited in the 4. §. out of the old Clementines attributed to the Apostles. but all will be of equall credit. and were it not for the inequalitie of Readers, none of it indeed deserued a place here. In those Clementines, a further command is, to giue

Matthew are inserted; wherein first is ordained the formall consecration of Oile and Water, that may haue power to heale sicke men, to cast out Deuills, and the like, with 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, I further ordain, that all first fruits be brought to to the Bishop, and to the Priests, and to the Deacons for their maintenance. and that all Tithes be offered for the maintenance of the rest of the Clergie, and of Virgins, and of Widowes, and of poore People. but here is no command of Tithes to be giuen to the Priests for their vse; but only for maintenance of the lesse Orders of the Clergie and of the Poor. and therein these Constitutions still agree with themselues. But, for the autoritie of them; take the iudgement of our Church, and I think you shall haue a generall consent, in this, that they are not of neer the Apostles time, but counterfaits of far later age. and great men in the Church of Rome account them no otherwise, howsoeuer Turrian (that first publisht them in Greek out of three old copies, as he saies) would needs perswade the World that they are genuine, Apostolique, and collected by Pope Clement the first. But I would then he had also perswaded vs that the Apostles had taught that the Birth of our Sauiour or Christmas day, was to be celebrated on the XXV. day of December, as in this suspisititious 
                     Lib. 5. Canon. 13.

Chrysostome then learned the time of the XXV. of December (which yet, most thinke not to be the exact time) from the Western or Latine Church. It is likely that till then, the Apostles Constitutions had slept? Besides, we see, that Dionysius that great Patriarch of Alexandria, although those of his See and himselfe were most curious in the determinations of Ecclesiastique times, could not find whence cleerly to resolue that question to Basilides Bishop of Pentapolis,

Basilides tells him, some think at the Cocks-crowing towards the morning, some at the Sater-day euening. and Dionysius acknowledges that difference in vse. But to set a certain houre of it, he answers him, is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, both hard and without sufficient ground. and then falls to examine it by the holy Historie of the time of the Resurrection. But had these Constitutions beene then in autoritie, cleerly Dionysius might soon haue resolud the question. for in them it

                      5. Can▪
                      18. & 19. is determined, that this strict fasting should be kept, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, vntill the time of Cock-crowing. This learned Patriarch (his Greek Epistle neuer yet publisht in Greek, with Balsamon vpon him, was communicated to me by that most learned and courteous Mr. Patrik Yong, in the rest of Balsamon Ms.) liued about CC. yeers after the supposed time of the

collection of these Constitutions, and surely had vsed them if they had then at all been, and deserued credit. and who would haue made a controuersie about the holding of Easter, that had in those elder times found it so established as it is in those Constitutions. But it is not difficult to coniecture out of what kind of shop they came, if you but note the supremacie of all power 
                     Lib. 2. Canon. 34. so arrogated in them to the Clergie. the Autors of them command that Priests be honord as Kings and haue tribute paid them as Kings, and are so bold as to apply that in 1. Sam cap. 8. 
                  Samuel, touching what a King would do in taking from his Subiects, to the power of Bishops, as if they should do so. and they affirm it, as much more reasonable, that Bishops should do so; and ordain also with

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, touching Kings. which well agrees also with their reckoning vp of the ten Commandements, and making the Tenth to be 
                     Lib. 2. Can. 36. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, Thou shall not appear emptie before the Priest. He that made these words to fill the place of one of the ten Commandements, seems not to talk like one of the Apostles. A thousand things more might be found to disproue the autority that some attribute to these Canons. and the answer to Turrians reasons for maintenance of them, are obuious enough. For my part, I think confidently that most of them, if not all, are hardly M. yeers old; and therefore no sufficient cause is, why they should haue place of credit in any part of our Diuision, as they bear the name of Canons or Constitutions. For if they were in truth made so long after those whose names giue them all their autoritie, they are all one, for Constitutions to be relied on, as if they had been but of yesterday. I only toucht part of them in this first CCCC. yeers, as they were in the Latin; the Greek being neither then by me nor much materiall; although some passages in other translations and to this purpose, if not examind by the Greek, may soon deceiue a Reader of too readie a faith. For one of those other Canons attributed also to the Apostles as Autors, and to this Clement as Collector, is translated,

               Of the V. Chapter.
               THose Abbots spoken of in the 1. §. were not of the ministring Clergie properly taken; but only principall Gouernors of such as had chosen a separated and single life; such as are in good number found in Pailadius his Lausiaca Historia, Cassimus, and the like more. For that of giuing Tithes to the vse of the Poor; it seems it must be vnderstood that they were most commonly giuen into the hands of those Abbots or some of the Clergie for their vse. and that they dispensed them. which may be collected out of the testimonies of that age wherein the goods and treasure of the Church is accounted but as the Poors chiefly in propertie. Beside those attributes of Tithes and other things consecrated, as tributa egentium animarum, and patrimonia pauperum, and the like, an obseruable admonition is, to this purpose, found in Isidore Pelusiota (that liud about the beginning of these CCCC. yeers) made to one Maro a Priest (whom he often reprehends) but specially 
                     Lib. 1. Epist. 269 & vide ibid. 425. for not leauing the goods of the Church and of the Poor (that is, what was offerd in Tithes, Rents, and other bounties) to be kept only by the OEconomus or Dispenser, or Steward (who in those times receiud them for the Bishop, and dispensed them by direction of him and his Clergie) but carried them home to his own house.

And hence is it that diuers Schoolmen to and fro dispute that question, whether the dominion or propertie of the reuenue of the Church be in the Clergie; and whether what they giue to the Poor be due debilo Iustitiae, or debito Claritatis.
               
               I supposed enough had been said in §. 3. to conuince the common error of them, which deriue Feudall Tithes from the Clergie of the time of Charles Martell, or affirm any common paiment of them then in practice. But it is a hard taske to teach obstinat ignorance.

But seeing so much of his sacrileges left in the storie of neer his age, and that not a syllable touching such Tithes as we here enquire after, nor any thing els that hath reference to the common paiment of them, is found in the Laws made vnder him, I still remain confident in what I haue admonished; and I think so will euery man els that hath an impartiall eie of iudgment.

So it may be that Casata is no quantitie of Land there,

as I haue coniecturd, but a house only. if it be, you see whence I was deceiud. pardon me. perhaps it was an error. I willingly acknowledge so much vpon this Reuiew. I acknowledge it, if that Capitularie of the Bishops and the other testimonie be therein authentique. I somwhat doubt them, because the most known and certain Laws of Martells time speak only of xijd. to be serud out of euery Casata, and the Nonae and Decimae grow not elswhere into vse till after the beginning of the French Empire. and if nothing but Casatae were spoken of, there were reason enough why they should be taken for Land. But the Nonae and Decimae in those autorities are referd to Land, and the xijd. only to Casatae.
               
               That in the 4. §. of the Tithe of time in Lent out of S. Gregorie, is not easily perhaps apprehended by euery Reader without a litle more explication. The Sundaies as they were exempt out of the number of daies, so were they from the fasting of Lent, thence comes his conceit of the Tithe of Time in XXXVI. daies, which is 1/10. of CCC.LXV. so Fractions be omitted. and to make vp fortie which is exprest in Quadragesima, the known name for Lent; the four daies preceding Quadragesima Sunday, are to be added. this was the intent of that fancie. But how sleight and nothing to the purpose, that obseruation of the Tenth of Time is (howeuer the Canonists, as sworn to their Text, make of it) is easily seen, not only in the abusd libertie of calculation of it, but also by the customs and Laws of both Churches the West and East in their various limits of this time of fasting.

Tithes part of their endowments? it was not, in these elder times, so much by giuing them Churches (as the most that speak of this, ignorantly think, telling vs that all Tithes came into Monasteries by appropriating of Parish Churches) as by conueying to hem diuers Tithes alone and newly created. and after those gifts, Consecrations, or new creations, n

But most of those Consecrations were at one time or another at length confirmd by Popes and Bishops, and so cleerly after enioyd; which plainly also supposed a former strength in them. For regularly, Confirmatio ex proprio significatu denotat firmitatem actus confirmati, as

But it is plain, that after Parochiall right established, that is since about M.CC. when the Canons grew more powerfull and obedience to them became more readie, such confirmations by bishops and Popes, and such consecrations, creations, or new grants by Lay men, of Tithes, haue bin taken and declared cleerly void, as you may see in a decree

                     Tit. de Dec. c. dudum 31. in another of his about Tithes so giuen or created to a Church by the King and Queen of Hungarie, and after confirmd by a Pope or two. and who can doubt now but that all such grants (in regard of preuention of the Parsons right) be not only void by the practiced Canon Law of this day, but also by the Secular or common Laws of most States (if not of all where Tithes are paid) in Christendom. For admit at this day, that Titius grant Decimas suas of such an Acre to the Parson, Abbot, or Bishop of such a Church, and this be confirmed by whom you will; The Tithe due from him Parochially is not toucht by it. why? because they are setled iure communi (as the Law is practiced) in the Parish Rector but in those elder times, such an arbitrarie grant vested the Tithe in the Church to which it was giuen, and no other afterward was paid. Why? because then notwithstanding the Canons, no ius commune, no Parochiall right of Tithes was setled or admitted in the practice of the Laitie. And for those ancienter grants; be not deceiud by such as tell you they were alwaies of Tithes formerly infeodated from the Church. that hath no ground to iustifie it▪ neither can any man at al proue any common course of such Infeodation of Tithes from the Church into Lay hands, to haue been in any State till the later times of Reformation of Religion in some places, and dissolution of Monasteries. and those two examples which are in Pope Innocents decrees are expresly of new creations, at least not of infeodated Tithes, as euery Canonist will acknowledge. But cleerly they both were in themselus according to the many other, but they had not the fortune to be confirmd in such time as the Pope or Clergie vsually gaue way to the former practice of arbitrarie Consecration.

And doubtlesse also, after such time as the Clergie saw that the Canons, made for Parochiall right of Tithes, had gotten force, and that the former creations or grants of Tithes by Lay men (which were indeed practiced agianst many Canons both Papall and Synodall) were, by that name of Lay-mens grants, creations or consecrations, declared vtterly void by the Pope and his Canon Law, although confirmed by whomsoeuer; such of them as had originally no other true titles to Tithes so commonly consecrated by Lay men, subtilly enough in the next foure hundred yeers, left off the pretence of their Lay grantors bountie (especially if the Grantor had been a common person) and betook themselues only to prescription

So that, when the prescription was good in regard of time and possession; although the originall Title it selfe were naught; yet because any other iust Title might be pretended to ground the prescription on (which also was Vide Innocent. 4. ad tit. le pr

                   not of necessitie to be proued incorporeall things) it was not difficult to haue a faire course to maintaine their possessions and right of such consecrated Tithes, as had been possest so fortie yeers before they were questioned by Parsons which claimed them iure communi. For against them, such a prescription by any other Church, Abbey, or Bishoprique or such like is a good Title. Remember also their erecting of Parochiall Chappells within the larger Territories, out of which they had portions. plainly, the erecting of such Chappells for Parish Churches (the Cure being there serued by some Monke or Vicar, instituted vpon the presentation of them which had the granted portions) made those portions at length also in many places be reputed for Parochiall Tithes, due in regard of those Parochiall Chappells. But what course soeuer they took; it seems certain, that the Titles deriud from Lay consecrations were after this third CCCC. yeers carefully conceald by the Possessors in such publike records of their reuenues, as were of more common and open vse in their legall proceedings at the Canon Law, howeuer they remaind still in their ancienter and more secret Chartularies. and with vs I haue very rarely, scarce at all, seen an Instrument of them in their Lieger books or otherwise, writen in a hand that is later then King Iohns time. the most are before him. But I haue seen Catalogues of the time of Henrie the third and Edward the first, of many large portions of Tithes, that doubtlesse came first from arbitrarie Consecrations, and that through most of the Dioceses of England, wherein not the least mention is of any Grantor. only possession is rememberd. and that, by prescription. was to be iustified. Some Titles also I haue seen made to Tithes in Libells of the

time of Henrie the third, especially in the Lieger books of Reading, Osney, and Pipewell. but in none of them euer any deriud from Consecrations. Neither indeed, in that ancientest Formularie of the Canon Law (I mean Durand, that liued about CCC.L. yeers since) is any other Libell for Tithes, then such as make the Title Canonicall. None that touches Lay consecrations; which diuers yeers before his time became as much concealed in legall proceedings of the Canon Law, as they had been in the more ancient times desired and hunted after by such as were enricht by them. This of arbitarie Consecrations, I presume, is like strange Doctrine to most men. it may well be. for the truth of it, I think, was neuer before so much as pointed at by any that hath writen of any part of our subiect. But I doubt not but euery vnderstanding Reader will think these things here now shortly noted on them to deserue his consideration, which I desire him also to referre to the XI. Chapter. and also let him apply to them the Admonitions toucht presently in Appropriations.
               For Appropriations which are in the 3. §. they consisted (as you see there & in the XII. Chapter) for the purpose, either in conueying Parish Churches appropriated with Tithes setled in them somtimes by a continuance of paiment, sometimes by Consecrations, or by both; or of Churches that were then appropriated when (according to the vse of the time) none or few Tithes were paid to them, yet afterward in the hands of the Monks or such like, when the Canons for paiment of Tithes came into force, got Parochiall paiment to be made to them; or thirdly in passing of Tithes formerly created and in esse. So that as by Consecrations, Tithes newly created, were setled in Monasteries and the like, so, by Appropriations, Churches with Tithes in esse, or with the pretended right to them, and Tithes alone (but formerly in esse) were conueid to them. The whole Appropriation of Tithes with Churches or Churches alone (we shew) in that ancienter time was made by the Patron. The Churches with Tithes (by the name of Ecclesia cum Decimis, when Tithes were paid to it) was in point of interest giuen by him. And many more Churches haue been so appropriated, then by the later and more known course. Neither, I think, haue many new Appropriations been since made. not many in regard of the number of the other. But deserues not this then another kind of consideration then is commonly dreamt on, among them which make Tithes due by the Diuine Morall Law to the Euangelicall Priesthood? if they be so; what had the Patron as Patron (were he either Temporall or Spirituall) to doe with them in conueying them to Monks, Friers, Nunnes, poor people in Hospitals? none of these, by that name, are of the Priesthood. and that way, they were so equally due to the ministring Priesthood before the Patrons title to the Church, that what euer he could do after he were Patron (although also his act were confirmd by whom you will) could not at all, it seems, touch them, or conuey

them from him that should afterward exercise the spirituall function of the Church. Consider Tithes so due; and how could any Monasterie deriue to it selfe any Title to that selfe same Tithe that was so due to the Priesthood? And if it had not the selfe same Tithe, but by prescription or other ciuill Title, hauing the glebe of a Church had also a profit by the name of Tithe as annext to the Church, no otherwise then other Lay endowments (for no man can doubt but that any kind of persons may inioy a profit vnder the name of Tithe or Tenth, aswell as a Rent of the Ninth part or of the Eleuenth) who then is it that now detains the Tithe due by the Diuine Morall Law, in cases of Appropriations? doth the Monasterie, or those which haue such appropriated Tithes by conueyance from it? or rather doth not the Parishioner, that is bound to whatsoeuer is by that Law due, although he pay neuer so many other Tenths due only by some ciuill Title? or by that Opinion, is not he that receiues the appropriated Tithe bound to pay a Tenth of it to the Minister, and the Parishioner a Tenth of his Nine parts. I affirme nothing here. it is no place for me to do it. But let these things be first considerable to euery one that talks of Appropriations, and concludes Tithes due iure diuino morali. And, for Lay mens right to the appropriated Tithes (that is, such as did either vest in the Monasteries by Appropriations, or at least haue been enioied by reason of them) let him examine it rather thus: may that which either Grant or Prescription, or other ciuill Title once setled and so euen consecrated to God and holy vses, although abusd, be afterward prophaned to Lay hands? But it is a grosse error to make it cleer as many do, that if Tithes be not due to the Priesthood iure diuino morali, then Appropriated Tithes may be still possessed with good conscience by Lay men; and that if otherwise, then they may not. For though they be not due so; yet is the consecration of them in the Appropriation, nothing? for if they be not due so, then it will be cleer, I think, to all, that they might passe in the Appropriation, as other things, subiect to the Titles of humane and positiue Law. The many execrations annext to the deeds of conueyance of them, and pourd forth against such as should d
                     •
                  uert them to prophan vses, should be also thought on. and let them remember also, who saies, that 
                     Prouerb. 20.25. 
                  it is a Destruction for a man to deuoure what is consecrated.
               
               To what we haue here of Episcopall right pretended to Tithes especially in Germanie, & of Tithes appropriated by Bishops, you may adde the examples of Thietmar Bishop of Werden in Saxonie, that 
                     Krantz. Metropol lib. 6. cap. 19. & cap. 29. & lib. 7. cap. 48. about M.C.XL. Contulit Ecclesiae suae vndecem Decimas, & Contulit fratribꝰ Decimam in Esse. As also his successor Herman, Contulit Ecclesiae suae mediam Decimam de Haselwerder, & integram in Rakestede, & Tunderling. and Luder Bishop there about M.CC.XXX. Contulit Ecclesiae Decimam in Emelendorp cum aduocatia, and ordinauit Scolaribus Decimam in Mendorp. It seems this their giuing of Tithes to their Church was an

assignment of them to the encrease of their Prebends, or such like. for it cannot, I think, be vnderstood of Tithes giuen to the Bishoprique by themselues, who as Bishops possest or pretended right to Tithes generally in their Diocese. But also, with that noted here touching Gerold Bishop of Oldenburg (or Lubek) his vrging them of the Deserts of Wagria to pay; obserue the words of his perswasiue Letter sent to them to get their Tithes.

Valete. It seems he was in some confidence, that because he was a Bishop, he might make them beleeue any thing of the Patriarchs and the Apostles. and you may see he loued the profit of the Tithes so well, that he would not stand vpon any vnlucky venturing his credit in Diuinitie, or vpon offering a plain falshood, in writing for them. For though they were due generally as he would haue them, yet how would he haue proued that all the Patriarchs and all that were by faith as the sonnes of Abraham, paid them? or that thereby they all had gaind praemia aeterna? and whence could he haue iustified it, that the Apostles ordaind that they should be paid? it may be therein he meant the Constitutions of the Apostles, of which enough before. if he did, how could he haue strengthened their autoritie? But they to whom he sent remaind still as farre from obedience as the historicall part of his Letter was from truth. And the truth was, he could by no means get any Tithes of them. But for that (in this §.) of Episcopall right, or the right of the Euangelicall Priesthood, so much pretended against Tithes enioied by Monks, that were indeed Lay men, howeuer reputed as a kind of part of the Clergie; it seems that in those daies the Bishops and Priests often stood so much on it, and so much and so often labourd

against Consecrated & Appropriated Tithes, possessed by the Monks (for they knew it was to no purpose to vrge the Lay owners, who after they had giuen Tithe by consecration would giue no more to any of them) that the most common place which in their Synods and Sermons they dealt on, was the right of Tithes, as due to the Priesthood. and in so much also and so vntimely was that common place vsed, that there talking of it was become a Prouerb to denote their frequent going from the matter. as if most vsually they fell into that, when they should haue talkt of something else. This is iustified by a passage of the Monk Aimonius in the life of Abbo Abbot of Floriacum, where he speaks of a Synod held vnder Robert King of France, about the yeer M. (when Aimonius liud) in the Abbey of S. Denis. Very many Bishops, saith he, were present at it, 
                     Vita Abbonis Floriac. cap. 9. 
                  Qui cum de fidei puritate & de corrigendis tam suis quàm subditorum prauis moribus sermocinari debuissent, iuxta vulgare prouerbium, Cunctum suum sermonem ad Decimas verterunt Ecclesiarum, quas Laicis ac Deo seruientibus Monachis auferre moliti, resistente eis in hac re hoc V. Dei Cultore Abbone, promiscuam in se vulgi concitauere manum. and such danger did the Bishops, in vrging it, draw on themselues, that they were driuen all to dissolue the Synod by running away. you see here Sermonem ad Decimas vertere, was as a prouerb to go from the matter. and for those words, Laicis ac Deo seruientibus Monachis; I think, they are not to be interpreted Lay men, and Monks, but Monks that were lay, and spent their time in the seruice of God
                  ▪ For there is no doubt but the Bishops and Priests obiected the name of Laici to the Monks here; and so was it fit, in the relation, to name them. and it was no wonder that the common people (whose bountie, in bestowing of Tithes on Monks, should thus haue turnd to nothing) so fiercely opposed them. If you vnderstand Laicis by it selfe here, then it may denote the arbitrarie detaining or disposing of Tithes by meer Lay men, which, I must confesse, Abbo and his Monks and all other Monks whatsoeuer had some reason to withstand. for they gaind much by it. But, I doubt, it cannot haue reference to Lay Infeodations. For as yet I could neuer see the least testimonie of an Infeodation of Tithes vntill many yeers after Abbo's time. it might perhaps denote them also. but I dare not cleerly affirm or denie here.
               The 4. §. is of ancient Infeodations of Tithes. What is in old testimonie of them, is there deliuerd. but for time; wee neither fetch them from Charles Martell, nor from the holy Warre of between M.XCV. and M.C. as others do. plainly both those Opinions are false. And it is as certain that they are false, as it is difficult to find the true beginning of Infeodations. Neither, I think, did any man euer referre them to Charles Martell, before Martinus Polonus Archbishop of Cosenza and Penitentiarie to the Pope, who wrote about M.CC.LXXX.

They are as farre out, that deriue them all from gifts made by Churches, or impositions by Princes. yet that most common opinion, that they all came first out of Churches is elder then the other, and as ancient at least as Frederique Barbarossa.

There is no question butt his opinion had soon Autors enough among the Clergie. For, the pretence of it was like enough a great perswasion to some Lay men to giue in their infeodated Tithes to the Church. and this the Canonists, for the most part, and generally the Lawiers of most States, take for a cleer truth. which I much wonder at, seeing that while they take it so, yet they interpret that

Neither was it anciently so interpreted by the Canonists. but in the other, that is, touching new creations of Feudall Tithes (in preiudice of the Church) by Lay men to Lay men, it hath been euer admitted, and is in practice both in France and Spain. and what better interpretation of it can be then the continuall practice vpon it since the making of it? and so how can it then be supposd but that Lay men before were chiefly the originall Autors of them?

                        rt. 266. pag. 1110. Lawiers here to iustifie their receiud opinion, bring this argument. Had they not come from the Church, they say, then had the Tithes themselues, which are now possessed by Lay men through Infeodations, paid Tithes also to the Church by reason of the many Canons made for paiment out of all yeerly increase. But this reason cleerly moues nothing. for the selfe same might haue been obiected against the known beginning of Tithes created and consecrated to Monasteries by Lay men. plainly by the Canons, notwithstanding such consecration, the Parochiall right to the Euangelicall Priesthood could not be diminished. and by them also, aswell a Tithe out of the Tithe consecrated, as out of the Nine parts of the Parishioner, might, for aught can be proued against it, be demanded by the Parish Rector.

But wee see cleerly both the originall of those consecrations to haue been from Lay men; and also that no Tithe was or is paid either out of them or out of the rest of the profits of the Nine parts. How then can the other argument touching Infeodations better cōclude here? beside it insists vpon Canons. and would conclude practice from Law. which course of proofe, vsd by most men that write of these things, is grosse and ridiculous. For who euer but indifferently obserues the storie of the elder time together with the Laws, shall soon find that in the Canon Law especially, an argument from debere fieri to factum esse, is scarce so sound as that so hist at among children, à posse ad esse. The truth seemes to be, that both in Consecrations, and Infeodations, and Appropriations of Tithes, there was not any other thing thought on then the name of Tithe, and the right of Tithes generally due to the Church; as if euery thing being the Tenth, and by that name as it were specificated, were presently the Clergies. so that whatsoeuer was by that name giuen away to meer Lay men or to Monasteries by new creation in either Consecrations or Infeodations, was, it seemes, taken alwaies to be the selfe same indiuiduall Tithe which was supposd due to the Clergie. which also doubtlesse was a cause why many Infeodations hauing originall only from Lay men, were falsly supposed to haue first come from the Church. for how easie was it that that which out of its own name only of Decima was presently taken as to be due to the Church, should be titled an Ecclesiastique right, and then in the passages of them which would haue had it so, be reckond among such things as the Church had a title to by a former possession? and cleerly many of the Laitie also could not but be very inclinable to that opinion. for so long as that held it is likely they resolud they needed not to pay any more to the Church. for when the Church would not keepe the feudall Tithes when it had them (they thought it once had them al) they conceiued doubtlesse there was no reason why they should pay it any more or other Tithes. Thus perhaps vpon diuers grounds and causes, both the Laitie & Clergie deceiud themselues in thinking of the originall of these Infeodations. But herein that which we haue toucht before to be considered in Consecrations and Appropriations is also considerable. for what could such Infeodations by Lay men to Lay men, hurt the right of tithes which was in the Priesthood? especially if due either iure diuino morali, or by any positiue Law ancienter then the Infeodation. But we haue not affirmd, that no Infeodations came originally from the Church. Questionlesse some did. and beside the examples alreadie noted, you may see that of Racherius

And that common distinction of the Canonists, of ius percipiendi, & fructus Decimarum here, is a mere shift, and nothing satisfies, vnlesse they could also teach vs how the fructus were the verie selfe same alwaies in Infeodations, and that they were deriued from a ius percipiendi in some Clergie man. Perhaps too much of these things; which are litle or nothing applicable to England, where we haue scarce any example of a Tithe, that was in its nature feodall, other then in such as were taken from Monasteries by the Statuts of Dissolution, and may still be calld, as originally, by the name of Consecrated or Appropriated Tithes, although now Infeodated. But thereof see the XIII. Chapter.

               After the Opinions of the age in the 6. §. the Laws both Imperiall, Prouinciall, and Pontificiall follow in the 7. vpon which let it bee considerd, whether a consecration of Tithes were so made by the power and law of the Church and Common wealth or both (in seuerall Territories, according to the Laws extended) that no prophanation or detaining them or any part of them, might afterwards be lawfull. and the like should be carefully thought on in the 1. §. of the VII. Chapter, and in the VIII. Chapter which hath the Lawes of England, for the same purpose. The force of the words of all those Laws; the Autoritie that made them; and the Territories to which they were extended, are especially to be obserud by euerie one that here looks after humane positiue Law. For manie talke and write of that, and tell vs here of ius Ecclesiasticum (at least if they faile in their Arguments from Ius diuinum) but whence that Ius Ecclesiasticum is, and where or when made, they little enough know. For what hath a Prouinciall Councell of one Nation to doe with another? What hath the Imperialls of the old French Empire to doe with England? Nay, what hath the Popes Decrees to do here? But because there was a time when their autority was more largely acknowledged; their Decrees that bred much of what now iustly continues in some States (which also iustly now denie their autoritie) remaine most obseruable. and wee haue giuen them in their places.
            
            
               Of the VII. Chapter.
               IN the last CCCC. yeers, beside the establishment of Parochiall right in Tithes, and the various Opinions touching the immediat Law whereby they are due; the Practice of most Christian Nations, as it might be had out of their Laws and Lawiers, is faithfully related.

And to what is there brought, adde that of the Law of France, wherby the right of the Tithe of all the Minesis claimd by

                   the King, as a droit de Souerainte, according as it is declard by two Edicts published of Charles the IX. and verified also by the Parlament of Paris. according also, the old Imperiall Law was. But through all here, you may see that the Customes Statutes and Common Laws, especially of France, Italie and Spaine, and of most other, if not all States, permit not, so fauourably for the Clergie, an exaction of them, or suite to be so generally brought for them, as the Laws of England did before the Statutes of Dissolution of Monasteries, and still do, if you exempt those cases which are founded only vpon those Statutes. What Statute or practice is in this Kingdome, that equals, the Carolines of Spaine, or the Philippine of France, which are generall Laws for Customes (quatenus Customes) de non Decimando? And whereas England vntill the Dissolution, had scarce a continuing Infeodation into lay hands (of which see the XIII. Chapter) nor could a lay man by the common Law before the Dissolution, make any title to Tithes as to lay inheritances; in other Nations Tithes infeodated haue been from aboue D. almost DC. yeers frequent in vse, and still continue legally in lay hands, and are subiect wholly to Secular Iurisdiction, as also other Tithes paid to the Church are, whersoeuer any such suite is commenced for them in their Spirituall Courts, as stand not with their libertie challenged from their Secular or Common Law. For euerie Christian State hath its owne Common Laws, as this Kingdome hath. And the Canon Law euerie where, in such things as are not meerly spirituall, is alwaies gouerned and limited (as with vs) by those Common Laws. For by that name are they to be calld as they are distinguisht from the Canon Law, which hath properly Persons and Things sacred only and spirituall for its obiect in practice, as the Canon Laws deale with Things and Persons, as they haue reference to a Common, not Sacred, vse or societie established in a Common wealth. Who knowes any thing in Holy-Writ knowes the vse of the word Cō
                     mon to be so distinguisht from Sacred. Indeed it hath other notions there also, and it is otherwise vnderstood in ius commune, frequently among Canonists and Ciuilians. But these nothing at all hurt the conuenience of this denomination. For by them, Ius commune is vsed as it is opposd to Municipale or Consuetudinarium. But here, and in the nomination of the English Laws, as it is distinguisht from Sacred or Spirituall. and so in this sense the allowance of Customes, and Parlamentarie Statutes (as they ought) fall vnder the name of Common Law with vs. Here I doubt not but it will be an obuious obiection, that I should rather call the supreme and gouerning Law of euerie other Christian State (sauing England and Ireland) the Ciuill Law; that is the old Roman Imperiall Law of Iustinian. For such a raigning, but most grosse Ignorance,

is euery where almost to be met withal in England, that you shal haue it affirmd for cleer that al other States are gouernd only by the Ciuil Law. Indeed, if they which say so, vnderstood Ciuill for that which is the Ius Ciuile of euery singular State, it were but the same to talk of Ciuill and Common Law. For the Common Law of England also is the Ius Ciuile Anglorum. But it is euen with one mouth pretended vsually, that the Body of the Imperialls, read and profest in the Vniuersities, is the Ciuill Law, that gouernes (as they say) all other States. But this, howsoeuer receiued through lazie Ignorance, is so farre from Truth, that indeed no Nation in the world is gouerned by them. For whersoeuer they are supposed to gouerne (let the briefe cleering of so common an error, get pardon for the digression) it must be taken, that they either gourne by their owne originall autoritie, as they are Imperialls, or from their being receiued for Laws into other States, which are not in that first way subiect to them. According to that first way; only the Empire and perhaps a good part of Italie, should be ruled by them. But it is plaine, that for the most part, the disposition of Inheritances, punishing of Crimes, course of Proceedings, Dowers, Testaments, and such other, which are of greatest moment vnder the Legall rule, are euen in those States, where, by reason of their first Institution, they retaine a kind of autoritie, ordered by most various Customes and new Statutes of seuerall Prouinces and Cities, so differing from those old Imperialls; that the whole face and course of them is exceedingly changed in practice. This is plaine to euery one, that obserues but the diuers Customes and Ordinances of the States subiect to the Empire; the Ius Camerale collected by Petrus Denaisius; the Nemesis Karulina, as it is set forth by Georgius Romus; and the many published Decisions or Reports both of the Imperiall Chamber, and the Rota's of Rome, Naples, Piemont, Mantua, Genoa, Bologna, and other parts of the Territorie of Italie. You shall find those Decisions, in matters of greatest moment, most commonly grounded on Customarie Law, or later Constitutions. So, that to affirme, that in these places the old Imperialls, or that Ciuill Law (as they call it) gouernes, is as if (for example) an equall ignorance shuld tel vs, that Spain were gouerned only by Alfonso's Parfidas, and Scotland only by Malcolms Laws or the Quoniam Attachiamenta; or that in the time of the old Emperors the Roman State had been alwaies gouerned only by the XII. Tables, or that England were legally ruled only by the Grand Charter, or by the two volumes of old Statutes. Like accession and alteration as any of these haue had, is found in the Empire and in Italie, where the Imperialls haue, through the power of the Emperors and Videsis dist. 10. c. 22. & 13. & extr de noui ops. is nuntiatione c. 1. Popes, any now continuing autoritie. Now, for other Christian States, which acknowledge no superior, or any subiection to the Empire (except Portugall, where the Roman Ciuill Law is autorized, by an Videsis Suarez. de legibus lib. 3. cap. 8. §. 3.

But is England therefore gouerned by them? It were as good a consequent to conclude so, as to affirme, that any of the other States were, because som petie things are ordered according to some Imperiall Text receiued and establisht by Custome. But this may seeme no fit place to speak more (perhaps not so much) to cleere this grosse error of such as yet pretend to know more then vulgarly, but can make no difference twixt the vse of Laws in studie or argument (which might equally happen to the Laws of Vtopia) and the gouerning autoritie of them.

And the Interpretation of those common Laws in most places, saue England and Ireland, hath of late time been much directed by the reason of the Imperialls, and only by the reason of them (not by their autoritie) and that also in case when they are not opposite at all to the common Laws, but seeme to agree with the Law of Nations or common reason. And this vse of them, at the furthest, began in its yongest infancie, not C.D.LX. yeeres since. For before that, euen from Iustinians time, they lay wholly out of vse: sauing only, that some pieces of them, with the Interpolations of Alaricus and his Chancelor Anian, together with Lumbardine Additions and Interpretations, had their power in some parts of Italie and the Empire. But for about D.C. yeeres together, that is, from Iustinian till Frederique Barbarossa, no Profession was of them in any Vniuersitie, no Doctorship, no other Degree taken in them. But after that time, they grew into a common Profession in this Western world (although by their own autoritie they are confined to Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus) and euen here in England were, about Henry the thirds time, often applied to the common Law in discourse and argument, as you may see in Bract

               OVt of this fullnesse of Laws that were made for Tithes in England, let it be considered (by such as enquire here de iure) what interest was of right setled in the Clergie by them (howsoeuer they were litle obeyed) And by what Autorttie made (we haue carefully added still what might help to a iudgement in that also) and how extensiue, in regard of Persons and Territorie, they were, and some such other; and how farre the Tithes might be, after such Laws, detained or

                  made subiect to Customes, or possessed as things of common vse, The Laws of before, as well as of after the Norman Conquest (as it is vulgarly called) are here gathered, and are perhaps equally obseruable, as the rest, in the consequent of a generall consecration of Tithes to the Church in England. For neither were the Laws formerly made, abolish by that Conquest, although, by Law of Vide Quintilien lib. 5 Institution. cap. 10. Atheric. Gontil de iure belli lib. 3. cap. 5 & Hetoman. Illust. quast 5. Warre, regularly all Rights and Laws of the place conquered, be wholly subiect to the Conquerors will.

But also, indeed, it was not to be reputed a Conquest, or an Acquisition by right of Warre (which might haue destroyed the former Laws) so much as a violent recouering of the Kingdome out of the hands of Rebels, which withstood the Dukes pretence of a lawfull Title, claimed by the Confessors adoption, or designation of him for his Successor; his neerenesse of bloud on the mothers side not a litle also aiding such a pretence to a Crowne. For the Confessors mother Emme, was sister to Richard the second, Duke of Normandie, to whom, William was Grand-child and Heire. But these were only specious Titles▪ and perhaps examined curiously, neither of them were at that time enough. And howsoeuer his conscience so moued him at his death, that he profest he had got

All this is plain out of the stories, and iustified infallibly by that of the Titles of many cōmon persons made to their possessions in England after his Kingdom setled, vpon the possession of themselues or their Ancestors in time of the Saxon Kings, especially of the Confessor. but this was alwaies in case where they by whose possession the title was made, had not incurrd forfeiture by Rebellion. many such Titles are cleerly allowd in the book of Domesday, writen in the Conquerors time. one specially is noted by the most learned Camden in his Norfolk. that, as I remember, is toucht in Domesday also, but enough others are dispersed there which agree with it. How could such Titles haue held if he had made an absolute conquest of England, wherein a vniuersall acquisition of all had been to the Conqueror, and no title could haue been deriud but only from or vnder him? More might be brought to cleer this; but we adde here only the iudicious assertion of a great Sharde in Caes. in I

It was spoken vpon an Obiection made in a Quo warranto, against the Abbot of Peeterborough, touching a Charter of King Edgar, which the Kings Counsell would haue had void, because, by the Cōquest, all Frāchises, they said, were deuolud to the Crown. But, by the way, for that of his neernesse of bloud, which could not but aide his other pretended Title; let it not seem meerly vain, in regard of his being a Bastard. There was good pretence for the helpe of that Defect also. For, although the Laws of this Kingdom, and, I think, of all other ciuill States at this day, exclude Bastards (without a subsequent legitimation) from enheritance; yet by the old Laws vsd by his Ancestors & Countrie men, that is, by those of Norway, a Princes sonne gotten Vide Roger de Honed. in Richard. 1. fol. 425. & 347. on a Concubine

But these things proue enough that this William seised the Crown of England, not as conquerd, but by pretence of gift or adoption, aided and confirmd by neernesse of bloud; and so the Saxon Laws formerly in force could not but continue. and such of them as are now abrogated, were not at all abrogated by his Conquest but either by the Parlaments or Ordinances of his time and of his successors, or else by non-vsage or contrarie custom.
               The Laws that are here gatherd are for the most part Latin, Saxon,
                  
or French. The Saxon is interpreted by the old Latin. But the Latin and French are left only in their own words. I presume, scarce any man that with the least care studies the subiect, wil confesse he vnderstands not the context of such Latin. And the French I translated not, specially because it is but the same which is in our old yeer Bookes and Statutes, and may indeed euen as soon be vnderstood by any fit Reader of the rest, as I could haue translated it. and I thinke the iudicious Searcher desires rather the originall tongue whateuer it be, then a translation. Therefore I suppose (if he haue not studied the Laws, or otherwise know it) he will rather take some minuts pains then blame me for not turning it. and howsoeuer to diuers peeuish Ignorants, out of their daintie stomachs, and a pretence of nothing but the more polished literature, it may here seem barbarous and distastfull; the truth is, it was the plain and genuine French of elder time spoken in the English Court, and now lothed only by such a know not at all how to iudge of it, nor vnderstand the originall whence it came to be and remain so with vs. I remember that old

If to so great a man that curious language could seeme no pleasanter when he studied it, it is the lesse wonder that the Law French (which doth as truly and fully deliuer the matter in our Lawes, as the Latin in the Imperialls; though indeed farre from polite expression) should bee so contemptible among the many petie Ignorants which vsually despise what euer their lazie course of studies hath not furnisht them withall, and most indiscreetly censure things only as they see them present, without regard to the cause or originall of them, which made them that they were first ineuitable and afterward remained, not without exceeding difficultie (if at all) alterable. But this by the way.
            
            
               Of the IX.X.XI.XII.XIII. and XIV. Chapters.
               VPon the discouerie of the Originall of our Parishes, of the ancient and late Practice of Tithing here, of Arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes made by the Laitie, of the first setling of Parochiall right to Tithes in England, of Appropriations, of Exemptions, of Infeodations, and the ancient Iurisdiction of Tithes (all which take vp these VI. Chapters) no fit Reader can be so blind as not to see necessarie

and new assertions and consequents to be made out of them in euery inquirie that tends to a full knowledge of the true and originall nature of Tithes, as they are possest or detaind by either Lay or Clergie man, in respect only of any humane positiue Law or ciuill Title. But we should here briefly admonish somewhat of our appropriated or consecrated Tithes, and conclude all with a touch of the Canon Lawes ancient autoritie, which in practice made such alteration in England, as is shewed, about the yeer M.CC.

Chapter. and let euery man first carefully looke that he know the course of old Appropriations. and the way how the Monasteries and Colledges came by them, before hee conclude rashly of the Tithes that are possessed through them.

And let him that detaines them (and beleeus them not due iure diuino) think of the ancient Dedications of them made to holy vses. and howeuer they were abusd to superstition, as the other large Indowments of the Church, before the Reformation; yet followes it not, without further consideration, that therefore, although so dedicated, they might be prophand to common vses and Lay hands. Consult herein with Diuines. But I doubt not but that euery good man wishes that at our dissolution of Monasteries both the Lands and Impropriated Tithes and Churches possessed by them (that is, things sacred to the Seruice of God, although abusd by such as had them) had been bestowed rather for the aduancement of the Church to a better maintenance of the labouring and deseruing Ministerie, to the fostering of good Arts, reliefe of the Poore, and other such good vses as might retaine in them, for the benefit of the Church or Common-wealth, a Character of the wishes of those who first with deuotion dedicated them (as in some other Countries

But I abstain from censure, and adde here by the way, a complaint made to the Parlament not long after the Dissolution, touching the abuse that followed in the Church through Lay

mens possessing of Appropriated Churches and Tithes. It deserues to be seriously thought on by euery Lay man that now enioy any of them, especially where Diuine seruice is not carefully prouided for.

Whanas Antichrist of Rome durst openly without any viser walk vp and down thorow out England, he had so great fauor ther, and his children had such craftie wits (f
                        •
                     r the children of this worlde are wiser in their generation than the children of light) that they had not only almost gotten all the best lands of England into their hands, but also the moost part of all the best Benefices both of Personages and Vicarages, which were for the most part all impropred to them (the Impropriations held by them were much more then one third of all the Parish Churches in England deuided into three parts) And whan they had the gifts of any not impropred, they gaue them vnto their friends, of the which alwaies some were learnd, for the Monks found of their friends children at scole. And though they were not learnd, yet they kept hospitalitie, and helped their poor friendes. And if the Parsonage were impropred the Monks were bound to deale Almesse to the pore, and to keepe hospitalitie, as the writings of the gifts of such Parsonages and Lands do plainly declare in these Words, in puram eleemosynam. And as touching the Almesse that they delt, and the Hospitalitie that they kept, euery man knoweth that many thousands were well receiued of them, and might haue been better, if they had not had so many grete mens Horse to fede, and had not bene ouercharged with such idle Gentlemen, as were neuer out of the Abbaies. And if they had any Vicarage in their hands, they set in sometime some sufficient Vicar (though it were but seldome) to Preach and to Teach. But now that all the Abbaies with their lands, goods, and impropried Parsonages, be in Temporall mens hands; I do not here tell that one halpenie worth of Almes or any other profit cometh vnto the people of those Parishes. Your pretence of putting down Abbeys, was to amend that was amisse in them. It was farre amisse, that a great part of the lands of the Abbeys (which were giuen to bring vp learned men that might be Preachers, to keepe Hospitalitie, and to giue Almesse to the poore) should be spent vpon a few superstitious Monks, which gaue not XL. pound in Almesse, when they should haue giuen CC. It was amisse, that the Monks should haue Parsonages in their hands, and deale but the XX. part thereof to the Poore, and preached but ones in a yeer to them that paid the Tithes of the Parsonages. It was amisse, that they scarcely among XX. set not one sufficient Vicar to preach, for the Tithes that they receiued. But see now how it that was amisse is amended, for all the godly pretense. It is amended euen as the Deuill amended his Dames legge (as it is in the Prouerbe) when he should haue set it right, he brake it quite in pieces. The Monks gaue to little Almesse, and set vnable persons many

time in their Benifices. But now, where XX. pound was geuen yerely to the Poore, in more than in C. places in Ingland is not one meales meat giuen. This is a

                  feare amendement: Where they had alwaies one or other Vicar, that either preached, or hyred some to preach, now is there no Vicar at all; but the Fermer is Vicar and Parson altogether; and onely an old cast-away Monke or Frere, which can scarcely say his Mattins, is hyred for XX. or XXX. shillings, meat and drinke, yea in some places for meat and drinke alone, without any wages.

                     , know more than D. Vicarages and Parsonages thus well and Gospelly serued, after the new Gospell of Ingland. And so the Autor goes on with sharp Admonitions to the Lay men, that fed themselues fat with the Tithes of such Churches, while the soules of the Parishioners sufferd great famine for want of a fit Pastor; that is, for want of fit maintenance for him. for without that, he is scarce to be hoped for.
               But we conclude with that of the Canon Laws getting such force, and making such alteration in matter of Tithes about the yeer M.CC. when through it, Parochiall payment became first to be performd here, or elsewhere, generally, and as of common right (where other titles preuented it not) and through it only; not through the ancienter secular Lawes made here for Tithes. For the suits for them in the Spirituall Courts either were all grounded vpon the Canons; or the common right of Tithes was now supposed in the Libell as a knowne dutie to the Clergie, without secular Law. It may soon be apprehended, that it was much lesse difficult about that time, then any other, for the Popes and their Canon Laws to gaine more obedience among subiects, and execute more autoritie ouer Lay possessions, when also they so easily vsurpt power ouer supreme Princes, which yeelded to them. For no time euer was, wherein any of them more insolently bare themselues in the Empire, neuer neere so insolently in England, as in the continuing times next before and neere about this change. And to all States the Church of Rome now grew most formidable. Remember but the Excommunication and Correcton sufferd by Frederique Barbarossa, Henry the sixt, and other Princes of the Empire, and by our Henry the second, and King Iohn. the stories of them are obuious. And our Richard the first, betweene those two, to gratifie the Clergie here for their exceeding liberalitie, in contribution to his Ransome from Captiuitie, with great fauour gaue them an indulgent Charter

                   of their Liberties; which being ioind with those other prone and yeelding Admissions of the Ecclesiastique Gouernment ouer the Crowne (
                     •
                  o were the times) doubtlesse gaue no small autoritie to the Exercise of the Canon Law in those things, which before about that time were diuersly otherwise. Neither was that part of the Canon Law, which would haue a Generall and Parochiall payment of Tithes, not only second to any, in regard of the Clergie's profit; but also none other, doubtlesse, was so great as it, in gaining the Clergie a

Direct and certain Reuenue. Therefore it was not without reason on their side▪ at such time as they saw the Power of Rome, that is, the autoritie of Decretals and of the Canons grew most dreadfull to Prince and subiect, that they should vrge this on to a continuing practice, and that with execution of the raigning Censures of the Church. Hence haue the Canons, in this point, hitherto here continued, and haue been and are binding Ecclesiastique Lawes, sauing wherein the later expresse Laws of the Kingdome crosse them. And thus out of the qualitie of the time, with regard to the practiced insolencie of the Pope and his Clergie, in putting their Canons and Decretals in execution, that receiud generall practice of Parochiall payment (neere almost according to the Canons) and other such alterations, that suddenly varied from former vse, and from the libertie of the Lay subiect, must haue its originall; not from any want of the Canons of the Church of Rome, as if they had not been here at all had or read, before about that time. For doubtlesse, the Canon Laws were here vsed and practiced as farre forth as the Clergie could make the Laitie subiect to them. For, about D. yeers before this alteration, good testimonie is of the publique and solemne receiuing of the Codex Canonum vetus Ecclesiae Romanae (mentioned by old Popes

But at that time there was no Law for Tithes, or mention of them in the known Canon Law of the Church of Rome, or in any other Prouinciall Canons, sauing in that of the second Synod of Mascon. Afterward also we find that Leges Episcopales

And X. yeers before Gratians Decree writen, it is certaine, that the Canons of the Church, generally by the name of Canones and Canonum Decreta (for diuers collections were of them, an some also confirmd by Papall autoritie, beside the Codex Vetus, before that of Gratian) were familiarly talkt of and vrged in that great

But while the rest of the Bishops stood so much vpon their

Canons, and euen in the face of Maiestie profest a rebellion, the King and the Lay subiects, it seems, grew so exasperated against them, that by publique command, for preseruation of the libertie of the Crown and Laitie, they were forbidden to be of any more vse in the Kingdom.

                        s Curtae lium, lib. 8 cap. 21. where he sayes, that Tempore Regis Stephani à regno iussae sunt Leges Romanae quas in Britanniam domus Venerabilis Patris Theobaldi Britanniarum Primatis asciuerat. Ne quis etiam libros retineret, edicto Regio prohibitum est. What he calls Leges Romanae, the most learnd Frier Bacon mentioning the same storie, stiles Leges Italiae, and takes them for the Roman Imperialls, and not for the Canan Law. I confesse, I see not enough cleerly here to iudge (vpon the words of Iohn of Chartres) whether it were the Canons or the Imperialls. on the one side, If we say he meant that Theobald or his Clergie, brought the Roman Canon Law; it might so seem as if it had not been here before in the hands of the Clergie, nor partly practiced by them. Which doubtlesse is otherwise. If on the other side we vnderstand the Imperialls (Copies of which indeed might well be at that very time brought as a noueltie hither; for they were then newly found; and plainly in Henrie the seconds time, they were here in the hands of the more curious Scholers, as you may see by Iohn of Chartres his citing of them) how then is that true which he presenly after saies of the encreasing power and force of those Leges Romanae? Sed, saith he, Deo faciente eò magis virtus legis inualuit quo eam amplius nitebatur impietas infirmare. What force or power at all had the Imperiall here afterward? where is any signe of it? But the obiection against that which might proue them not to haue been the Canon Laws, may not difficultly perhaps be answered. It is true that the Canons of Rome were here before, and read, and partly practiced in the Church. But diuers Collections were of them about this age of King Stephen, and perhaps some later and larger Collection might be brought hither by Archbishop Theobald, or some of his Clergie, which are vnderstood, I think, in that Domus Venerabilis Patris Theobaldi. He himselfe perhaps might bring Iuo's Decree (when he came from Rome in 3. of King Stephen) and endeuour the strict practice of it here; which the King and the Lay subiect had reason enough to dislike) or some of his Clergie might perhaps afterward bring in Gratians Decree, that was both compild by Gratian and confirmd by Pope Eugenius the third, about ten yeers before Theobalds death, that is, about 16. of King Stephen. And this way those words of Legis virtus inualuit, may haue their truth. For howeuer that opposition against the Canon Law were, it is most certain that this first part of the body of it (the Decree) was presently vpon the first publication of it in vse in England, and familiarly cited by such Diuines as talk

time of Henrie the second, is seen in the Epistles of that Iohn of Chartres; which yet remain and are, I think, the ancientest examples of proceedings in our spirituall Courts. But notwithstanding that first part of the body of the Canon Law, which expresly commanded Tithes to be generally paid, were here soon receiud among the Clergie, yet about L. yeers after that, the former course of Arbitrarie Consecrations of them continued. and both that and the rest of those courses in disposition of Church-reuenues which so differ from the Canons, and from the practice of this day, was not fully alterd till some Decretalls came hither with more powerfull and dreadfull autoritie (as the times were) of some of the following Popes, especially of Alexander the third, and Innocent the third, which two alone, I think, sent as many commanding Decretalls into euery Prouince as all their Predecessors had before done; and especially into England, as is alreadie shewd, they sent diuers (only for the matter of Tithes) which were all first of Papall autoritie for the particular ends for which they were sent, and so were obeid as Canon Law, although none of them became parts of the generall Canon Law vntill Gregorie the ninth put some of them into his Decretalls autorised by him in the yeer M.CC.XXX. about which time perhaps and diuers yeers before, the Canon Law of Rome was not only read here priuatly among the Clergie, but professed also in Schooles appropried to it. so I ghesse is that close Writ of 19. Hen. 3. to be vnderstood, which prohibited the holding of Scholae Legum in London. it was directed to the Maior & Shrifes commanding them,

This was fiue yeers after the Decretalls published. and it seems most probable, that these Leges were Canon Laws, perhaps mixt (as vsually they were) in the profession also with the Imperials (for both of them were, it videsis 39. Hen. 3. apud Matth. Paris hist. maiori a. d. 1255. seems, studied here vnder Henrie the third by the Clergie, more then any other part of learning) and therefore were forbidden as being both, in regard of their own autoritie, against the supreme Maiestie and independencie of the Crown of England.

            The Printer to the Reader
            AS I found the Copie partly Printed partly Writen, so is this done off; sauing only where those faults, and perhaps some other which your courtesie, Reader, may amend) are committed. Neither thought I it fit to alter any thing without the Autors presence, whence euen the syllables of those passages in which mention was as if it were yet but in part only printed (as my Copie was) are also retained.
