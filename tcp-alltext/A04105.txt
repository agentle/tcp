And of the ſygnes and tokens that were ſeene before 
it was deſtroied: which diſtruction was after Chriſtes 
aſſenſion .xlii. yeares.
            To the tune of the Queenes Almayne.
            
               AN Emperour Vaſpaſian
               Some tyme in Rome there was,
               Through whom much dolors then be gan
               Of mortall wars alas,
               With in two yeares that he did rayne
               He put the Iewes to myckill payne
               With fyer and ſword both take and ſlayne,
               His power brought ſo to paſſe,
               His Sone Tytus hauing no dread
               His army ouer Iudae ſpread
               The people to the Citie flead
               Hoping to haue redreſſe.
            
            
               ¶Before Titus Vaſpaſians ſonne
               Vnto this warres dyd goo
               Was after Criſtes aſſencion,
               Longe .xl. yeares and two
               Then did the Romayns with ſuche pride
               Be ſet theyr land both far and wyde,
               And hemd them in, on euery ſide
               To theyr great payne and wo,
               They brought the Iewes in ſuch a caſe
               The propheſye, to bryng to paſſe,
               Spoke by our Lord when he here was
               The ſcripture doth ſaye ſo.
            
            
               That prudent Iewe Ioſephus ſayes
               Who did no wryte in vayne,
               That he was preſent in thoſe dayes
               And ſawe this mortall payne,
               When that Tytus both bold and ſtout
               Be ſet Ieruſalem a bout,
               That none mought in, nor Iſſue out,
               No waye but to be ſlayne.
               For Tytus his chyef capteyn was
               The ſeige when he had brought to paſſe
               Great was the cry woe and alas,
               The ſtory doth ſaye playne.
            
            
               ¶He ſtopt their pypes and Conduyts all,
               That no water mought paſſe:
               With famyne they were in great thrall,
               Moſte wofull was their caſe,
               They were conſtraynyd in ſuch need
               With Horſſe, and Aſſe, them ſelues to feed
               Both Dogg, and Catte, this do I reed
               Moſt ougle meate it was,
               The honger ther it was ſo great,
               Ones vomit was anothers meate
               Ther was no waye for to intreate
               But preſent death alas.
            
            
               Sixe mounthes the ſiege it did holde on
               A bout that Citie great,
               Whearin was manie a mothers ſonne
               Did ſtarue for lacke of meate,
               The famous Ladies of that towne
               That weare before of hie renowne,
               For fault of foode fell in a ſowne
               Ther was nothinge to geate:
               The ſtorye this doth ſpecifie,
               The mothers moſte vnnaturally,
               They ſlewe their Children rufully,
               And Roſtyd them to eate.
            
            
               This Titus then of hye renowne
               Moſt valyently and bold,
               The walles ſo ſtronge he did caſt downe
               Reſyſtaunce waxyd colde,
               The people in the ſtreetes laye dead,
               They had no Succour drynk nor bread
               Muche was the blood that then was ſhead,
               Alas lament wee ſhould:
               The Romains entred with ſuche might,
               With Polare, ſpeares, & ſwerdes ſo bright
               They ſlew all that came in their ſight
               No mercie they did hold.
            
            
               The Gates that couered were with golde
               They threw them to the ground,
               That famous Citie to behold
               For ſinne it was confound,
               A leuen honderid thowſande ſlaine
               Through honger, ſwerde & peſtelent paine
               In this the ſtorie doth not faine,
               Of manie a blooddy wound,
               The ſtinke of carkas in the ſtreete,
               The feble ſoules that could not fleete
               For faint with honger ſkarce could creepe,
               Full heauie was their ſounde.
            
            
               Then Titus gaue this ſentence bliue
               Which Romayns lykyd well,
               As many as you fynd a lyue,
               After this Rate them ſell,
               As Criſt was ſold for thyrtye pence,
               By Iudas and his falſe pretence,
               So Titus made their recompence
               The ſtorie thys doth tell,
               XXX. Iewes for a penie bougt,
               As manie more were ſolde for nought
               Ther owne confuſion thus was wrought
               Becauſe they did rebell.
            
            
               And manie priſoners mo I weene
               To Egipt they weare ſend,
               Fowerſcore thouſand, and ſeuenteene
               In priſon all their ende,
               And Titus in his companie
               Tooke manie ſuche as were worthie,
               And lead them bounde all captiuelie,
               To Rome with him to wend:
               Ther was no helpe for to reuoke,
               As Ihoſephus ſaith in his booke
               His Chronicles who liſte to looke,
               On truth they do depend.
            
            
               Thirtie years God gaue them ſpace
               That they mought yet repent,
               Their liues amend and call for grace
               For them Chriſt did lament,
               This louinge Lord oft did them call
               By ſundrie ſignes as heare you ſhall
               Before his wrath on them did fall
               Or anger fullie bent,
               Twelue dayes eclipſed was the moone,
               That they mought bee conuerted ſoone,
               But they wiſt not what to bee doone,
               But ſinne ſtill did augment.
            
            
               Before the ſeige or anie warr,
               the ſpace of all one yeare
               Ouer that towne was ſeene a ſtarre,
               Moſt blaſinge bright and cleare
               So like a ſworde in ſhape it was,
               Wher at great feare and wonder was,
               Yet left they not their wickednes,
               when theſe ſignes did appeare:
               More ouer in the ayre ſo light,
               In plate of maile and armore bright,
               Were ſeene men redie for to fight,
               To ſhewe theyr time was neare.
            
            
               A feſtifall daye, in Apriell,
               To halowe they were dight,
               And ſodainlie amongeſt them fell
               A merueylous ſtraunge light,
               So bright and cleare with ſuche aleame,
               Paſſing the ſonne as it did ſeeme,
               But what it ment no man could deeme.
               But were all in ſore flyght
               And whyle the priſtes did this in dure
               To offer a Calfe they did their cure,
               Whiche Calfe a thinge againſt nature,
               Brought forth a Lambe in ſight.
            
            
               Suche manie tokens contrarie
               Whiche doth Prognoſtikate,
               And to the Iewes did ſignifie
               Their wofull fall and fate,
               Before that Titus warr be gan
               Fower yeares of ſpace, this proue I can,
               How that the ſonne of one rude man,
               Ananias lowe of ſtate,
               He ran the ſtreates in ſuche a rage
               Beinge a child of tender age,
               To call and crie he did not ſwage
               Repente eare it be late.
            
            
               But for his paines he was well beat
               This had he for his hire,
               For truthe they did him euill in treate
               Againſt him did conſpire,
               But yet he cried and would not blen,
               While he was able yet to ren,
               Sayenge wo be to Ieruſalem,
               For kindling of Gods yre:
               Wo be to thee and to thy land
               Thou art be ſet in wofull band,
               Thy dayes of ſorowe is at hand
               Of famine ſwerd and fyer.
            
            
               This was that famous Citie then
               Diſtroyed with fier and ſword,
               That mightie towne Ieruſalem,
               The Citie of the Lorde:
               Becauſe their God they would not knowe
               Chriſt being .xxx. yeares belowe
               His word to them plainlie did ſhewe
               This ſcripture doth recorde,
               That they mought be his choſen firſte
               To liue and raigne a mongſt the iuſt,
               And to no other for to truſte
               But to belyue his word.
            
            
               Nowe ſeinge that this Ieruſalem,
               As ſcripture doth tell true
               Was plaguyd for the ſinnes of men,
               Which Romaines ouer threw,
               What ſhall that Lorde to vs expreſſe
               That ſo doth liue in ſuche exceſſe,
               Of whordome, Pride, and couitouſnes
               More now then did the Iewe,
               Therfore is our example this,
               A mend the thinge that is a myſſe
               That we maye haue eternall bliſſe,
               By Chriſte our Lorde Ieſue.
