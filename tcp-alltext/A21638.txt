               THe Quenes Maiestie perceyueth that notwithstanding her commaundement lately
publyshed for the ceassing of certayne vayne and vntrue reportes touching a decry of
monyes, yet the same continue styll, appoyntyng the same to be done from one market
day to another, wherof arryseth great trouble amongst the people, and increase
of the prices of all maner thinges both forrayne and natural, and specially of graine
and other victuell: and for that her Maiestie thinketh that aswell some simple people
of doubtfulnesse and without euyll meanyng do geue occasion to the continuaunce
of the sayde rumours, as the greedy and cursed sorte do to make an vnordinate
gayne of theyr wares, grayne, bestiall, and other victuell, thynkyng nothyng
enough for theyr vnsatiable & vnmercyful gredines. For remedy thereof both to content the one, and to refourme
the other, her Maiestie doth plainely and sincerely declare to all maner her subiectes, that these foresayd rumours
and reportes be vntrue, and that her Maiestie doth not determine to alter or decrye her monyes. And this her
Maiestie woulde the honest sort of her subiectes to accept for trueth, and as to thother whose greedinesse or curiositie
wyll not alow nor permit credit to be geuen to this her Maiesties Proclamation: Her Maiestie straightly
chargeth all maner her ministers to see all such as shal after this Proclamation publyshed and notified, by any
meanes set foorth any contrary report or speach, to be attached and emprisoned, and so to remayne without bayle
or mainpryse duryng the space of three full monethes: and beyng therof duely conuicted, to be set openly vppon
the Pyllory as persons that haue spredde sedicious rumours, and not to be deliuered vntyll he or they shall haue
founde sufficient assuraunce of good abearyng. And yf any person shalbe conuicted to haue harde any other so offendyng,
and haue not enfourmed therof the next Iustice of peace with conuenient spede: the same person also
to be committed to prison duryng one moneth, as one that hath wyllyngly mayntayned a sedicious person, and
to be further punyshed at the discretion of the Iustice that shall so commit hym. Finally her Maiestie wylleth
the Iustices of peace in euery shire of this Realme, and other her ministers in all townes Corporate, to consulte
together, not onely amongst them selues, but also with other Iustices and officers of other shires thereto adioyyng,
for the furniture of markets with victuel and grayne, for victuellers and other poore people, as the season
of the yere requireth. And yf any sort shall wylfully and fraudulently holde vp or enhaunce the accustomed prices
of any maner of thyng contrary to reason and good cause: her Maiestie woulde that the Iustices of peace and all
Maiors and other officers aswel within liberties as without, shoulde apply them selues to refourme the same, as

                  〈◊〉
                good order in such cases is requisite. And if the enormitie of the offendour shall seme so to require, to sende vp
the offendour to her priuie counsell, to receaue such further punyshment as shalbe in reason deuised for the same
and yf the sayde Iustices and other ministers shall not therein vse the aucthoritie to them commytted for the ap
