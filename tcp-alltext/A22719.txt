            TO THE VNPAR
               tiall Reader.
            
            
               IN matters of this nature, where a loyal deſire hath endeauoured to performe an acceptable ſeruice to the Common-wealth; albeit the ſucceſſe ſort not in euery point, anſwerable to hope and expectation: yet this may ſtand for a maine com
                  •
               ort, that the intention

tention is free from all publique offence, or priuate wronge, and therefore reſpects not the taxe or ſcandall of thoſe malignant humours, which are accuſtomed to caſt corrupt aſpertions on honeſt deſignes. But becauſe this proiect hath meerly and ſolely proceeded from mine own poore conceit and labour, (ayming ſpecially at the aduancement of mutuall Commerce, the bond and ſinewes of humane ſociety) I haue thought good for the auoyding of all doubtfull conſtruction or miſtaking (which might blemiſh it in the birth) to deliuer it into the world, with a perſpicuous Ouerture and direction concerning the

port and vſes therof; becauſe they are but briefly touched, and in generall terms ſet downe in the Patent.
            Arthur Gorges.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            AN OVERTVRE AND EXPLANATIon of the purport and vſe of this OFFICE.
            
               FIrſt, it is to be vnder ſtood that this Office to be knowne and called by the name of The publique Regiſter for generall Commerce, is indeed but the very reſemblance of a

publique Market, whereunto all men may freely repaire, and reſort to Trade and Traffique, without conſtraint or reſtraint, at their owne wils and pleaſures. And as in Markets many Commodities are ſolde and met withall more eaſily, and better cheape in one ſelfe place, then by ſeeking vp and downe the Countrey for them with m
                  •
               re trouble, and at dearer rates in ſeuerall places: ſo is it by the vſe and benefite of this Office, which as a publique Market, is ſolely in his Maieſties power to authoriſe and priuiledge.
            Secondly this publique Market is a place which all men may eaſily finde out and freely repaire vnto, for ſpeedy meanes of helpe vpon any extremity

of for feitures of bondes or counterbonds, or danger of morgages of landes or goods by breach of d
                  •
               yes, when they know not ſuddenly where to prouide themſelues of moneyes vppon good ſecurity; for that euery man (eſpecially thoſe that dwell in remote ſhteres) is not acquainted with a Broker, nor knowes aſſuredly where to finde one to ſerue his turne vpon ſuch vrgent occaſion, or if he doe▪ it will be at a deare rate: which defect this Regiſter ſhall be able to ſupply with very conſcionable and moderate conſideration; taking nothing of any, but what the parties themſelues ſhall in reaſon thinke fit and competent for the ſeruing of their turnes, by the trauell of the Officers.
            
               
Thirdly, by inſtance to make it more plaine, ſuch men as haue monies lying by them, that they would expoſe after eight, nine, or ten in the hundred may, if they pleaſe, make it knowne & haue it regiſtred in this Office, wherby ſuch as repaire vnto this Regiſter to borrow, may alſo receiue notice & direction accordingly for ſuch ſummes as they deſire by aſ signment from the Officers, if the ſecurity be good and liked of.
            Fourthly, by way of example alſo to expreſſe the vſe and benefite of this Office for Buying and Selling: Suppoſe that one hath lands or a houſe in Wilt-ſhiere that he would gladly ſell, ſuddenly to raiſe monies, without too

great loſſe, but knows not how to make it generally knowne to the world; and that there are ſome others as deſirous to buy lands or a houſe in that ſhire at a reaſonable rate, and cannot learne nor get knowledge of any ſuch; yet by recourſe to this Register they may eaſily informe themſelues, and haue mutuall intelligence of one anothers mindes perfectly, and readily, albeit they dwell farre aſunder; wher as now many times both parties are in care and cannot ſerue their turnes accordingly, vndergoing thereby much inconuenience, which this Office with great eaſe doth remedie.
            Fiftly, the parties themſelues that do either lend or borrow, buy or ſell, may

               
                  •
               ſe it with as great ſecurity & ſecrecy as they ſhall thinke fit by vſing other mens names then their owne, other places then their owne houſes, and other friends or Factors for themſelues if they be ſo diſpoſed. So as by this free, plaine and eaſie courſe all men may reſt ſatisfied, that there is no cunning intent by meanes of this Office, to defraude men, nor by the practice thereof to diſcouer mens wealths or ſecret estates, further then to themſelues ſhall ſeeme good.
            Sixthly, it is neyther deſired nor meant that any ſhould leaue their moneyes or goods that they would lend or ſell, in the charge or cuſtody of this Office, but in ſuch places as the owners

themſelues ſhall thinke most ſafe and conuenient; wherby ſuch as would borrow or buy, may (if they pleaſe) by this Regiſter be directed to thoſe places or perſons that would Lend or Sell to ſerue their 
                  •
               urns mutually. And by this courſe all men may reſt ſecure of the integritie and faire dealings that ſhall bee vſed concerning other mens monies and goods; which the Patentees ſe ek not to haue the cuſtody or expoſing of for their priuate profit, but will rather auoide the accidents and dangers of ſuch hazards, and loſſes, as might happen in ſo great a charge, by miſ-reckoning, robbing, or many other waies, which we ſee ſo often happens vnto men in their owne priuate houſes. And ſuch a misfortune

might be both a diſparagement to our credits by wrong conſtructions, and alſo a taxe and preiudice to the proceeding and reputation of this Office (which conſiſting meerely of the good opinion of the world for the iuſt dealing to be vſed therein) if it be found contrarie or corrupt, it cannot ſubſiſt, but will die in it ſelfe as vnprofitable.
            Moreouer wheras manymen dwelling far from London, are now inforced to repaire thither, to their great trauaile & charge to ſerue their turn; many waiesin theſe forenamed kinds; by the benefite and vſe of this Office they ſhall be much eaſed. For it is intended (by the fauour of God) that in

ſeuerall places of this Realme this publique Regiſter ſhalbe kept in ſome ſuch chiefe Cities or Townes as ſhall bee found moſt conuenient to ſerue the Countries next about them in theſe affaires, and to holde correſpondency with the Citie of London.
            Againe, it is very certaine that diuers landes, leaſes, houſes, woods and chattels, which haue beene ſolde priuately at very low rates, to the no little loſſe of the owners, would haue bin purchaſed at more indifferent prices, if they had bin more publiquely knowen: for it often falleth out, that thoſe who would gladly buy ſuch, do ſeldome or neuer get knowledge of the Sellers intent, till the things deſired be paſt

recouery, 
                  •
               o the preiudice of both parties: which defect this publique Regiſter will be a great meanes to ſupplie.
            Furthermore, there are a world of extraordinarie things, which are but few mens monies, and the owners themſelues would gladly vent if they knew how, but lie concealed or in effect loſt in the ſale, becauſe that diuers others, which would as willingly buy ſuch at valuable prices, know not how or where to recouer them. But herein it is to be vnderſtood that no commodities of baſe qualitie or inferiour values ſhall be entred into this Regiſter, but ſuch as the Officers ſhall thinke fit to be dealt in, without diſparagement of the place.
            
               
Beſides, it often falleth out that men vpon extremity are driuen to pawne things of good value for ſmal ſummes, to ſerue their turnes with monies, vntill they can ſell them outright; wherin they vſe the means of Scriueners or Brokers, in whoſe hands they leaue the ſaid pawnes, ſetting very reaſonable prices on them; allowing alſo a reward: and yet notwithſtanding it is often ſ
                  •
               ene and ſpoken of, that many Scriueners or Brokers, to whom ſuch things haue beene committed in truſt, would neuer vent them at the owners prices, except they might make a greater ſurpluſage to themſelues then the rate limited. And by that meanes many haue beene kept in want of ſuch reliefe, as their owne goods would affoord

them; whereby at laſt their pawnes haue eaten themſelues out in vſury, or at leaſt 
                  •
               aue beene ſolde to great loſſe, the owners wanting means to redeeme them: to which grieuance this publique Regiſter may yeelde a comfortable remedy.
            Moreouer, whereas many conſcionable men would willingly expoſe their monies for eight or nine in the hundred, but cannot make it knowne, and therefore doe put their ſtockes into the hands of Brokers or Scriueners to imploy for them: ſo it is, that thoſe Brokers doe for the moſt part take ten in the hundred for thoſe monies which the owners doe affoord at a cheaper hand; thereby wronging both

the lender and borrower: which inconuenience this publique Register would eaſily remedy, by giuing all men ſafe and ready meanes to expoſe their own monies; beſides the aſſurance neuer to be deceiued in their truſt, which now many times happens when Brokers or Scriueners do chance to fall banckrout.
            Furthermore, whereas there is daily occaſion of returning and paying of monies from one part of the Kingdome to another, by meanes of Trade and Commerce: and therein is found a great defect for want of ſome ſafe and ſpeedy meanes of direction, for interchangeable correſpondency in that behalfe (becauſe that

men are now inforced eyther to conuey thoſe monies that they are to pay or receiue, by Carriers, Clothiers, or 
                  •
               eruants, who are many times robbed; or elſe men are driuen to be at extraordinary coſt, for the returnes of monies, by letters of exchange) by the vſe of this publique Regiſter men may (if they pleaſe) greatly eaſe and remedy both theſe inconueniences. And to expreſſe the manner of doing it by example (which is the plainest way of inſtruction,) Suppoſe that if any Gentleman, Merchant or Tradeſman of the North, vpon occaſion of buſines, being come to London, giues notice there vnto this Regiſter, that he can make preſent payment of monies in Yorke at a certaine day, to ſerue the

turnes of any Londoners, or others in that place, if they will deliuer the like ſummes in London; and ſo accordingly may any Londoners or others ſearch the Regiſter to that or the like intent, whereby to giue himſelfe knowledge of any interchangeable correſpondency, for payments or receits at Yorke. And in this ſort may men mutually vnderſtand one anothers mindes for Trade and Commerce, and with no leſſe facility and ſecurity ſerue their turnes one of another in matters of this kinde, throughout all thoſe Cities of this Kingdome, where this publique Register ſhall be erected and kept, which will be free for all men to repaire vnto, at their pleaſures. But herein it is to be vnderſtood,

that this publique Regiſter ſhall not be made ſo vulgar, as to bee kept in euery chiefe Citie or Shieretowne within the Realme, but in thoſe neceſſary and commodious places that ſhall be found moſt fit for the publicke good, and to performe thoſe beneficiall Offices that are promiſed and may be expected by the vſe of this publique Regiſter for the aduancement of generall Commerce.
            Againe, to giue thoſe men that would borrow full ſatisfaction, how they ſhall be aſſured when they come to this Regiſter for direction in that behalfe, and haue giuen the Officer ſuch gratuity, as in reaſon and out of his owne free will he hath thought

fit, in regard of the note or direction deliuered to ſerue his turne, for the ſummes that vpon good ſecurity he would take vp, and not be diſappointed nor loſe his reward giuen: Jf it ſo fall out (for ſuch accidents may happen) that either the party that ſhould lend this money be from home, or elſe how otherwiſe ſo diſpoſed of his ſtocke, (ſince the intelligence giuen to this Regiſter) that he cannot inſtantly ſerue the turne of him that would borrow; let that party againe returne to the Office, and he ſhal either pr
                  •
               ſently haue another note, whereby to ſerue his turne, or elſe he ſhall receiue the reward that he hath giuen the Officer in that behalfe: Whereby may plainly appeare, that there ſhall be no

ſhifts vſed eyther to fruſtrate men of their deſired purpoſe and hope in this Office, or trickes to draw rewards for that, which by the vſe of the Office, or trauell of the Officer is not merited. And in this point I haue thought fit to giue good caution; both for that ſuch chances may ſometimes fall out: and beſides it is not vnlikely, but that this obiection may be made. And therefore very pertinent to the purpoſe, and to auoyde doubts', plainely to ſet downe an anſwer, and certaine reſolution, what men may depend vpon, and how they ſhall be dealt withall in ſuch caſes, thereby to auoyde all ſcruple. And as in matters of borrowing, ſo vpon occaſions of buying, the like courſe and reſtitution ſhall be vſed.
            
               
But becauſe amongſt all theſe Ouertures and relations, the
                  •
               e hath not beene any mention made, either when or where this publique Regiſter ſhall be erected and kept; the which it may be preſumed men will expect ſhould haue beene in this diſcourſe related, touching that point, it is v
                  •
               ry requiſite this much to ſiy: that the Office is of ſuch a nature, as that it will require many things neceſſary for the complete ordering and fitting thereof, as alſo no leſſe care and circumſpection in the choice of ſuch Officers and Clerkes, as ſhall be anſwerable and ſutable to that integritie and iuſt dealing that is promiſed by the Patent, in the behalfe of the Patentees. Beſides, to finde out and faſhion a

conuenient place fit for this Office could not be done ſuddenly, nor in haſt, conſideri
                  •
               g that our Patent was not paſt the Seale little more then a moneth ſince; and before that time the Patentees n
                  •
               t aſſured whether it ſhould paſſe, or not: and therefore no reaſon f
                  •
               r them to make preparation for that which lay not in their owne powers to diſpoſe of. Notwithſtanding iſ it ſo f
                  •
               ll out, that the proiect (in manner as it is expreſſed) proue acceptable to the world, in regard of the publique good, which is the true ſcope and end thereof, this may ſuffice, that all expedition ſhalbe vſed for the erecting thereof, and ſufficient notice giuen by ſome publique manner of intelligence in what place it ſhal be kept.
            
               
Laſtly, whereas his excellent Maieſtie according to the custome of former times, and of all well policed States, hath in his Princely diſpoſition pleaſed to giue grace and preferment to diuers honeſt Proiects and profitable inuentions, which haue truly tended to the publique good, without wronging the particular right of any; and in that regard hath alſo vouch ſafed to grant his Letters Patent for the ſole priuiledge and practiſe of this new inuented Regiſter to the Patentees, if any vndutifull or malignant ſpirit for a ſelfe priuate gaine, will expoſtulate the iuſtneſſe of this proceeding, it is thus truely and briefly anſwered, That it is in all equity as honourable for his Maieſty,

to prouide as good meanes for the eaſe and benefite of his people in generall (without any abridgement of former liberty) as it is lawfull or iuſt for any priuate Scriuener, Broker, or other, to prouide a courſe to aduance his owne particular eſtate and profite, which is often done to the detriment of many. And now that the nature, vſe and ſcope of this publique Regiſter is plainly and truly manifeſted▪ I leaue all men to their owne ſenſe and liking, and the ſucceſſe here f to the eternall guider of all things.
