            The fyrste prologue. ¶Here Begynneth the Prologue of thys presente boke folowynge which is called oure Ladyes myroure.
            
               VIderunt eam Filie Syon / et beatissimam predicauerunt.
               Cantice. vi. These wordes are writen in holy scrypture & are thus to say in englyshe / The doughtres of Syon haue sene hyr (that is to say oure lady) and they haue shewed hyr mooste blessyd. In whiche wordes the holy goste sayth thre thinges that longe to the praysynge of oure mooste blessed lady. ¶Fyrste who they be that prayse hyr / whan he sayeth. the doughters of Syon. ¶The seconde / what they doo or they begynne to prayse hyr / whan he sayeth that they haue sene hyr. ¶The thyrde / the maner of hyr praysynge / whan he sayeth & they haue shewed hyr mooste blessed / therfore he sayeth. The doughtres of Syon haue sene hyr and they haue shewed hyr moste blessed. ¶Fyrste the holy goste tellyth who they be that prayse our Lady / for he callyth them doughtres of Syon. But though all chrysten soulles that treuly lyue in chrysten fayth / may be called doughtres of Syon / that is to say of holy chyrche: yet more properly ye ar called doughters of Syon. For not onely ye ar doughtres of holy chyrche by chrysten byleue as other chrysten people ys: But also ye are doughtres of this holy relygion / which as a mother noryssheth youre soulles in grace in this Monastery that ys named Syon. And therfore as ye are doughtres of this bodely Syon / so ought ye to be doughtres of Syon

gostly / For Syon ys as moche to say / as a cōmaundement or byholdinge. And ye ought to be doughtres of cōmaundement by meke & redy obedyence to the byddynges of god / and of youre reule / and of youre soueraynes / ye ought also to be doughtres of byholdynge by cōtemplacyon. & specyally in byholdynge of youre owne wretchednes / and of youre vnkyndenes agenste god / and of the charite & goodnes that he dothe to you. ye oughte to beholde also the shortnes and vnstablenes of thys lyfe / the hastynes of dethe / the ferefulnes of dome / the bytternes of paynes / and the swyete and ioyfull rewardes of blysse. And if ye be thus good doughtres of Syon by meke obedyence and by trew beholdynge of these thynges: then ar ye well dysposed the more worthyly to prayse oure moste gloryous lady. ¶The seconde thynge that the holy goste tellyth in these wordes (ys) that ye ought to doo or ye begynne to prayse oure lady. And that ys that ye oughte to se her. For ye wote well that no man ne may well shewe the worthynes or the propertyes of any thynge to the praysynge therof: but yf he haue fyrste som syght & knowlege of the same thinge by one meane or other. How shall ye then condewly shewe by outwarde praysyng the excellent hyghnes and worthynes of the moste blyssed heuenly quene oure reuerente lady / as yt is full fayre expressed in al youre holy seruyce: but yf ye haue fyrste syght therof by inwarde vnderstandinge. ¶But for asmoche as many of you / thoughe ye can synge and rede / yet ye can not se what the meanynge therof ys: therefore to the onely worshyp and praysyng of oure lorde Iesu chryste and of hys moste mercyfull mother oure lady

and to the gostly cōforte and profyte of youre soules I haue drawen youre legende and all youre seruyce in to Enlyshe / that ye shulde se by the vnderstōdyng therof / how worthy and holy praysynge of oure gloryous Lady is contente therin / & the more deuoutely and knowyngly synge yt & rede yt / and say yt to her worshyp. ¶And in many places where the nakyd letter is thoughe yt be set in enlyshe / ys not easy for some symple soulles to vnderstonde▪ I expounde yt and declare yt more openly / other before the letter / or after or else fourthe wyth to gyther. ¶And farthermore / that ye shulde haue the more sprytuall loue / & inwarde delyte and deuocyon / in thys holy seruyce I tell the causes & the meanynges of eche parte therof that is to say / whan I come to the fyrste Inuitory▪ I tell what an Inuitatory ys to say / and why yt ys namyd so & set in suche a place. And so I do of Psalmes / and Hympnes / and Antempnes / and respōces and versicles / and all suche other. For I declare why they ar callyd so / that ys to say / why an hympne ys callyd an hympne / and why an Antepmne is callyd an Antempne / and so fourth of other / and why they ar set & sayde in suche wyse / as ye may se more playnely in the story of the Sonday / eche thynge in hys place. ¶Of psalmes I haue drawen but fewe / for ye may haue them of Rycharde hampoules drawynge and out of Englysshe bibles if ye haue lysence therto ¶Also when I drawe a thynge ones in to englysshe I write it not agayne as often as I fynde it after in eche place / but onely in the fyrste place / as Gloria patri, is declaryd i

And this treatyce ys the fyrste parte of the boke. The seconde parte ys of youre seuen storyes / accordynge to the seuen dayes of the wyeke. And the thyrde parte is of youre masses. ¶And for asmoche as ye may se in this boke as in a myrroure / the praysynges and worthines of oure moste excellente lady therfore I name it. Oure ladyes myroure / Not that oure lady shulde se herselfe therin / but that ye shulde se her therin as in a myroure / and so be styred the more deuoutly to prayse her / & to knowe where ye fayle in her praysinges / and to amende: tyll ye may come there ye may se her face to face wythouten eny myrroure. ¶And therfore now moste dere and deuoute systres / ye that ar the spouses of oure lorde Iesu chryste / and the specyall chosen maydens & doughtres of his moste reuerēde mother / lyfte vp the eyen of your soulles towarde youre souerayne lady / and often & bysely loke and study in this her myrroure / and not lyghtely but contynually / not hastynge to rede moche at ones / but labouryng to knowe what you rede that ye may se and vnderstonde her holy seruice / and how ye may serue her therwyth t

            ¶Here endyth the fyrste prologue / and begynneth the seconde.
         
         
            
               YT is not lyght for euery man to drawe eny longe thyng from latyn in to oure Englyshe tongue. For there ys many wordes in Latyn that we haue no propre englyssh accordynge therto. And then suche wordes muste be turnyd as the sentence may beste be vnderstondyd. And therfore though I laboure to kepe bothe the wordes and the sentence in this boke as farre as oure language wyll well assente: yet some tyme I folowe the sentence and not the wordes as the mater asketh. There is also many wordes that haue dyuerse vnderstōdynges / & some tyme they ar taken in one wyse / some time in an other / and som tyme they may be taken in dyuerse wyse in one reson or clause Dyuerse wordes also in dyuerse scryptures: ar set & vnderstōde some tyme other wyse then auctoures of gramer tell or speke of. Oure language is also so dyuerse

in yt selfe / that the cōmen maner of spekyng in Englysshe of some cōtre / can skante be vnderstondid in some other cōtre of the same lōde. ¶And for these causes and suche other / yf any persones there be that holde them selfe cōnyng as some do / that whan they can onely a lytell gramer / or a lytel latyn / and scarcely that wel▪ they ar more bolde to catche at a mannes saynge / or at hys wrytynge / then wolde many wyse clerkes that be. Therfore yf eny suche parsone happen to se this boke or eny other of oure drawyng and fynde eny thynge therin not drawen to hys entente / and therfore is redy to blame yt / and to say yt is wrōge▪ I coūsell you that in symplenes seke your soulles fode▪ and to take lytell hede at hys saynges. wyttynge well that the wyser that eny man ys▪ the better wyll he be aduysed / or he blame an other mannes studdy.

               dyth not. And therfore they that holde them selfe so wyse / may be contente wyth theyr owne wysdome For I began thys werke nothynge for them / but for the edyfycacyō of you yt fele symplely in your owne wyttes / & loue to be enformyd. I am not wyser thē was seint Hierome / that in ye drawyng of holy scripture frō other lāgage in to latyn / sayth how he was cōpellyd at eche boke to answere to the bakbytnige of them that depraued hys laboure.In prologo primo super Ioh. ¶But for that I knowe myne owne feoblenes / as well in cōnyng as in verteu▪ therefore I wyll neyther seke defaulte in other / ne maynteyne myne owne▪ but lowely I submyt me and all oure wrytynges / and other werkes

For why oe there ys thre thynges in goddes serluyce / that ys to say. The sentēce / the worde / and the songe. the notes and sōge serue to the wordes, and the wordes serue to ye inwarde sentence

And all thre bothe sentence. worde. and songe / serue to sturre ye soulle. to loue. and to worshyp & to prayse god & to haue ioye and deuocyon in hym. And therfore all thentendaunce / that shulde be had aboute the songe▪ oughte to entende to thys ende. and therafter to be demed. For ye oughte not in syngynge to seke pleasaunce of voyce / ne delyte you in swetnes of the selfe songe / ne in hygh songe. ne in curyous syngyng ne in no maner of vanyte. but only to seke cōpuncy on for youre synnes / and deuocyō in god. and in hys holy mother / whose praysyng ye synge.In regula.

But all this oughte so to be rewlyd / that the spyrytes of all be kepte in reste / and that deuocyō in god. be furthered therby and not letted.

Thys salutacyon ys taken of the gospel of the gretynge of the aungell Gabryel. and of Elyzabeth. & yt was the begynnynge of oure helthe And therfore thys worde Aue. spelled bakwarde. is Eva. forlyke as Eues talkynge with the fende was the begynnynge of oure perdycion. so oure ladyes talkynge wt the aūgel when he gryte her wt thys Aue. was the entre of oure redempcyō. And

so Eua is turned in to Aue. for our sorowe is turned in to ioy. by meane of our lady. For Eua ys as moche to saye as woo. & Aue ys as moche to say as Ioye or wythout woo. Therfore mekely. & reuerently thankyng this glorious quien of heuen. and mother of our sauiour. for our delyueraūce▪ say we deuoutly to her Aue maria. Hayle mary.

Ryghtful men are strengthed the more / by more nere assystence of aūgels to them. by namynge of yt holy name. Fendes trembel for feare. when they here this dredfull name.

                  MAria, In thys Responce ye prayse oure lady of tow thynges. & tow thynges ye aske of her. And in the verse ye aske foure thynges. ¶The fyrst thynge of praysynge is. that ye calle her an howse so fayre arayed with the flowres of all vertewes▪ that the blessed Trinyte wolde dwelle in her and yet he closed her and all thynges in hym. And to thys praysynge. ye put a petycyon. that she vouchesafe as an howse to close in all wretches vnder her defense. ¶The seconde praysynge ys. that ye saye that she ys prudente and a ware spender and dysposer of goodes.

                  THre thinges ar nedefull to the comon helthe of man. The fyrste ys. that the vnderstondinge. be lyghtened with knowlege of trouth to knowe what ys good & what ys yuel. And for thys knowlege ys had by redynge & heringe of holsome doctryne▪ therfore yt ys vnderstonded by the lessons. ¶The seconde ys. good vse of the frewyl that the wylle assente to loue that. that ys knowen good.

And this is vnderstōded. by the verse that is as moche to saye as a tornynge. for the knowlege and wylle. oughte thus to be turned in to dede.

And after the verse. a parte of the responce is songe ageyne. For as a good wylle causeth good dedes. soo good dedes helpe to stable, and to strengthe the good wylle. ¶The lessons are harde. and the responce are songe syttynge. for knowynge of trouthe and ryghte rewlynge of the wylle. maye not be. but in a restfull soulle. But the verse ys songe stondynge. for good dedes may not be done wythout laboure. The responce ys songe of all. for euery man maye haue a goode wylle. that is vnderstonded by the responce. But the verse ys songe but of few. for all folke may not fulfylle theyr good wylles in dede. that ys vnderstonde by the verse. so moche as the holy apostell saynt Paule sayde.Romanos. vii. that he myghte not do the good that he wolde. The lesson ys redde of one and herde of all▪ In token that eche congregacion oughte to lyue vnder one gouernoure. that shall teche them and rewle them after goddes lawe. For eche man namely relygious oughte not to do after hys owne wytte or knowynge. but after the obedyence and techynge of holy chyrche and of hys souerayne. ¶Also ye shall vnderstonde that all thys worlde ys departed in to thre tymes.

Domum tuam, Euerlastynge holynesse

bysymeth lorde thy howse. that ys the vyrgyn mari in whome yu hast cladde the in fayrnesse. & gyrthe the in strengthe. ¶Here oure lady is called goddes howse. for he dwelled in her wombe. as in a howse. and there he cladde hym in fayrenesse that ys to saye in a body of mankynde. whyche was the fayrest body that euer was sene of man. in naturall fayrenesse. and moche more after hys resurreccyon whan yt was vndeadly.

And for saynt Iohn̄ was lykened to the day starre. for as that starre goeth before the sōne. so saint Iohn̄ wente before our lorde in his cōcepcion & in his byrthe. in his prechynge. & baptysynge. & in his dethe▪ therfore thys sō

Blyssed be the lorde god of Israel. for he hathe vysyted & made the redēpcyon of hys people ¶Our lorde Iesu cryste was yet then in his mothers wombe. but zacarye spekyth of tyme to come. as of tyme past. for sykernesse of hys ꝓphesy. For yt was syker to be fulfylled. as yf yt had bene done. Et erexit coruu, And he hathe set vp an horne of helthe to vs. in the howse of Dauyd hys chylde. ¶An horne growyth in the hyest parte of a beaste. and yt ys harder then the flesshe. and softer then the bone. and therwyth the beaste defendyth hym ageynste noyous thynges. So oure lorde Iesu cryste toke hys body of the hyghest and worthyest parte of mankynde that ys our lady. and that manhod of hym ys myghtyer aboue all mankynde. and weker then god. and therwith not onely he ouer came hys enemys. but they also ye cleue therto in faythe and deuocyon. maye therby sewrely be defendyd from all contrary powers. And therefore oure lorde Iesu. ys an horne of helthe to vs. in the howse of Dauid. whiche was goddes chylde. For though he were a greate kynge and a prophete. yet he was meke and obedyente to god. as a chylde to hys father.

Not one day to begyn well. a nother day to leue of. but all oure dayes. whyle we lyue. ¶when zacharie had thus prophesyed of oure lorde Iesu cryste. he turned hym and spekyth to Iohn̄ hys sonne. and sayeth. Et tu puer, And thow chylde shalte be called the prophete of hym yt ys hyest. that ys of god. For thow shalte go before the face of the lorde that ys cryste. to make redy hys wayes. ¶Here say some doctoures that lyke as saynt Iohn̄ beynge in his mothers wombe felte the voyce of our lady when she gaue gretynge to his mother Elyzabeth. and ioyed ther

                  Ad dandam scienciam, To gyue knowynge of helthe to hys people. that ys. to enforme the people. and to make them knowe that he was crist that cam for helthe.

For our lorde Iesu crist made peace. betwene god and man. and betwixte angel and man. and betwyxte man and man. and he geueth man peace in hys owne conscyence.

For complyn betokeneth the ende of mannes lyfe. or the ende of the worlde. when the chosen of oure lorde shall be delyuered from all trauayle and wo. and be broughte to endelesse quiete. and reste. And therefore eche persone oughte to dyspose hym to bedde warde. as yf hys bedde were hys graue. For as a man dyeth or he be borne to hys graue & buryed. righte so at complyn tyme ye shulde be dysposed as yf ye were in dyynge. And kepe you so sober. and stylle afterwarde.

lorde Iesu cryste in hys manhod. Therfore when oure lady broughte fourthe her blyssed sonne Iesu cryst in to the temple as is before sayde. this holy man had knowlege therof by inspyracyon of the holy gooste. and came and mette wyth oure Lady in the temple. and toke her blyssed sonne Iesu in hys armes wyth greate ioye of harte. as he that hadde founde the ioye that he had longe desyred.

In thys Lesson ys tolde the cause why god gaue to man. and to aūgel fre choyse whyther they wolde do good or yuel And how god ys worshyped specyally wyth three crownes. The fyrste crowne ys the vertew by whyche he made aungels. The seconde crowne ys the verteu by whyche he made man. The thyrde crowne ys the verteu by whyche he made oure lady to the reparynge bothe of man and of aūgels.

Qui a principio, whyche from the begynnynge after he had made the worlde and all creatures▪ at the laste by hys verteu he made man. geuynge hym fre choyse. that by hym he shulde stande parseuerantly in good. to good rewarde. and not falle into yuell. to yuell rewarde. Nam sicut, For as agenste men, theyr workes are acounted for lytell that wylle not worke tyll they are compelled to worke by stockes. or by fetters. and theyr workes ar worthy loue and ryghte good rewarde. that not constrayned. but of free wylle do that they haue to do of pure charyte▪ & lyke wyse yf god had not gyuen free choyse to aungels. and to men. they shulde seme in maner to be cōpelled to do tho thynges that they shulde do & theyr workes to be worthy lytel rewarde. Placuit igit
                   Therfore yt plesed that verteu that ys god hymselfe. to gyue them fredome to do what they wolde. and he made them fully to vnderstōde. what rewarde godly

obedyence shulde deserue. & what paynes prowde vnobediēce shulde make his folowers worthy.

For she vnderstode the wordes of the prophetes. better then dyd the same prophetes themselfe. And therfore knowynge by her ꝓphesy what paynes her sōne shulde suffer in all hys holy body▪ she sorowed gretly as often as she behelde tho partyes of his body wherin he shulde suffer specyal paynes.
