               ¶Rowe thy bote thou ioly ioly maryner, & wynd wel vp thy sayle,
               For thou mightst neuer wind it vp better thine own self for to auaile.
            
            
               THere ware thre mery maryners, that dwelt in Maldon meade
               That could sayl of wynde and tyde, of chanel and of streame
               And eke theyr compasse well dyrecte, from euery shore & steade
               And ware acqueinted wt the rockes: and sandes yt myght them queame
               From Maldon hauen to Billingesgate, aswel I vndertake
               As any thre of many yeres, suche course that vsed to make.
            
            
               A Crayer had they prest to sayle, and all theyr takle yare
               And all theyr fraught ybrought a borde, to wende to Maldon towne
               But for the wynde was not the best, before they forth wolde fare
               They thought the citie for to rowme, and viewe it vp and downe
               If thing vncouth they there might fynde, wherwt to moue some glee
               When they came home to Maldon meade, amonge theyr companye.
            
            
               To Powles they hyed as place most fytte, for newes in theyr deuyce
               Amonge the prynters gan they search, and busily enquyre
               For thinges that might for Noueltie, at home be had in price
               The printer sayd he thought he had, to pleasen theyr desyre
               And drewe them nere into his shoppe, and gan vnfolde them lyght
               A rolle of Rythmes, wherof the fyrst, the dickers dreame it hyght.
            
            
               Then folowed answere to this dreame, to Dauie dickers whan
               A solempne processe at a blusshe, be quoted here and there
               With matter in the margent set, wheron to gase they gan
               But they ne wist for ought I knewe, but hebrue that it were
               A Replicacion was the next, whiche well I vnderstoode
               For that I founde no worde therin, but it was Englyshe good.
            
            
               But lo ye here the fourth quod he, that maketh vp the moste
               I warrant you a clarkely pece, se howe it is be deckte
               (As sellers are not nowe to learne, theyr wares to prayse I gesse)
               The name therof Reioynder was, a terme to them suspecte
               Because it sounded of the lawe, as though some case it warre.
               Of ioyncture right for waywarde wyues, to pleaden at the barre.
            
            
               
               But ay the prynter pressed on, and take them all quod he
               I notte your names, but brethren myne. I you assure can
               They be as good as in this towne in any shoppe there be
               Our names quod be, and one stepped forth, a wight yonge watre man
               Wylkyn is my name, and this is watte, and Herman hight the third
               As trusty and sure at tackle knotte, as euer with corde was gyrd.
            
            
               Well Wilkin, Watte, and Herman gent, by al your names I sweare
               Ye shall not nede vpon my worde, to stande in any doubt
               A meryer iest ye can not fynde, a boord with you to beare
               So wyll ye say your selues I knowe, when ye haue red it out
               But yf ye be vnlearned to reade, as maryners lyghtly be
               Then yf ye lyst to harke a whyle, ye shall it heare of me.
            
            
               For Gods swete bones quod Watkyn tho, for bokyshe be we not

               And cables folde, and clymbe to toppe, and then go tosse the potte
               But if thou wylt of curtesy, of this vs somwhat say
               By god my peny shalbe twayne, and theyrs shal make a grote
               Though we therfore shulde go to bed, at nyght with thyrsty throte.
            
            
               Nay then quod he Saynt George to borowe, the day is ours all
               Ye shall it heare eche lyne at length, but fyrst and wote ye what
               The partyes twayne betwene the which, this stryfe is nowe befall
               It me behoueth fyrst to tell, good order asketh that
               Wherfore a whyle gyue eare I pray, tyll I those twayne set out
               And then ye may your fansye say, by turne eche one about.
            
            
               This Diker semes a thryuynge ladde, brought vp in Pierces scole
               The plowman stoute, of whom I thynke ye haue ful often harde
               A swynckyng swaine, that handleth wel his spade and other toole
               Ful loth he ware for lacke of hede, they shulde be reckly marde
               For why in them and in his hande, his lyuynge chefely standes
               He bragges not of his rentes ne fees, ne of entayled landes.
            
            
               And yet he semeth a curtouse hind, and comen of good stocke
               For Dikers feawe in my contrey, so wel y thewed bene
               I warraunt you who lyst him proue, he is no spritelesse blocke
               But to my tale, In cockowe tyme when eche thyng gan to gren
               All weryed from his worke, retournes this Daui Diker hende
               And for to ease hym selfe the bet, ful softely gan he wende
            
            
               
               Unto his house within a groue, a lytle there besyde
               His bottle & his bagge, he hent, he left them not behynde
               Wherin remayned but small surplus, of viande at that tyde
               And downe he sate hym on the benche, of meate had lytle mnide
               But gan complayne his werynesse, and on his hande his hedde
               He dyd arrest, & cleped wyfe, as though he wolde to bedde
            
            
               Lo dame he sayd thou wotest I trowe, that candle is to diere
               To sytte vp late and praten out our thryft tyll farther nyght
               And eke I nyll no supper haue, lette be put out the fiere
               And hast we all to bed I saye, that ryse betymes we myght
               And in he stepte, and sone he was vncased in his couche
               And at his heade as was his wonte, he layed vp his pouche.
            
            
               To wery labouring men, full swete doth seme such rest
               He had not lyen longe, but loude he gan to route
               And softly by his syde his wyfe, her selfe to bed adrest
               The dogge, the cat, and syb the mayde, eche couchen them about
               Into theyr hernes where they ware wont, and al was huyst and styll
               And Dauy gan to dreame his dreame, as we deuysen wyll
            
            
               Then Wylkyn gan at once vpbrayde, and sware by gods dyne harte
               A rushe for bookes, me leuer ware that I could tel this tale
               Then of your scrabblynges for to haue, a loade by wayne or carte
               Strawe for such peltry, it is good to stuffe an empty male
               I durst it take vpon my soule, in all this lyther thynge
               Is not a tale that may be founde so muche to my lykynge.
            
            
               Yea yea quod Wat, my selfe by gisse, in youth might this haue learned
               If I so wyse or happye had ben to folowe my fathers wyll
               Who would haue spent vpon my scoole so muche as he had earned
               But I was bent another waye, me thought it very yll
               All daye to rucken on my tayle, and poren on a booke
               It was nothyng vnto my paye, full soone I it forsoke.
            
            
               But Herman here our other mate, it was a wytty elfe
               Ado, ado, quod herman then and prynter yet go forth
               What was the dreame that Dauy mette as he it tolde him selfe
               For yet me thinketh by thy fare, that dreme is somewhat worth.
               Content quod he gyue heare agayne, and here me what I sayne
               I shall you reade this dreame a ryght, as here I fynde it playne.
            
            
               
               Dauye Dikers dreme.
               
                  WHen fayth in frendes beares fruite, and foolyssh fansies fade
                  & crafty catchers come to nought & hate great loue hath made
                  When fraude flieth farre frō towne: & loyterers leaue ye fylde
                  And rude shall runne a ryghtfull race, and al men be well wylde
                  When gropers after gayne, shal carpe for common wealth
                  And wyly woorkers shall dysdayne to fygge and lyue by stealth
                  When wysedome walkes a lofte, and folly syttes full lowe
                  And vertue vainquisheth pamperd vice & grace begynnes to growe:
                  When Iustice ioynes to trueth, and lawe lokes not to miede
                  And brybes helpe not to buyld faire bowers, nor gyftes gret glotōs fiede
                  When hongre hides his head & pleinty pleaseth the pore
                  And nyggardes to the nedy men shall neuer shutte the dore
                  When double darke deceipt, is out of credite worne
                  And fawnyng speche is falshed founde & craft is laught to skorne
                  When pryde that pykes the purse, gapes not for garmentes gay
                  Nor Iauelles weare no veluette wiedes nor wandring wittes beare sway
                  When riches wronges not right, ne power puttes pore abacke
                  Nor coueytous criepes not into court nor learned lyuinges lacke
                  When slipper sleightes are sene and farre fatches be founde
                  And pryuate profite and selfe loue shall both be put in pounde
                  When debt no sergaunt dredes and courtiers credite kepe
                  And might melles not with merchaūdise, nor lordes shal sel no shiepe
                  When lucre lastes not longe, and hurde greate heapes doth hate
                  And euery wyght is well content, to walke in his estate
                  When truth doth treade the stretes, and lyers lurke in den
                  And Rex doth reygne and rule the rost, and wiedes out wicked men
                  Then balefull barnes be blyth, that here in Englande wonne
                  Your stryfe shall stynt I vndertake, and dredfull dayes be donne.
               
               
                  This Dyker was no fole I gesse, quod Watte and Herman tho
                  It semeth well he hym bethought, vpon the worldes change
                  And of his drudge and myckle payne, when he to bed dyd go
                  And then to dreame of such lyke thynges, perdy it is not straunge
                  Such as my talke and thoughtes haue bene, the day before certaine
                  Such thīges again at night in slepe, my dreme hath shewed me plaine.
               
               
                  And eke I harden ones, a ryght good doctour tell.
                  That such as farced go to bedde, with meate and drynke good store
                  Theyr dreames alwaye to them in more dysordre fell
                  Then yf they empty went to bedde, as ye haue harde before
                  That Dauie dyd whose supper was, so slender and so short
                  That nothynge els but wearynesse, and nature caused hym snort.
               
               
                  
                  A dreame, a strawe quod Wylkin then, by god it nas no sweuyn
                  Men dreame of deuyls, of apes, and 
                        •
                     wles, of naked gyrles and boyes
                  But I ne thynke this dreame is such, it hitteth thynges so euen
                  It talketh with good reason rounde, of fansies ne of ioyes
                  But of suche thynges as I can not, amenden with my wytte
                  Nor neuer shall I thynke be founde, refourmed euery whytte.
               
               
                  No quod the prynted no, that ment not the dreame I vndertake
                  But where as many thynges ben foūd, that mans wyt can not fatche
                  To mend as many as we can, and the rest a paterne make
                  To brynge our state as nyghe to them, as mans deuyce can matche
                  As out of Plat
                        •
                     es commen welth, a tale I coulde you tell
                  Of many thynges that he wolde haue, and not but very well:
               
               
                  That neuer yet in earthe ware founde, as he wolde haue them done
                  Quod Watte no more of Platoes lore, I ken him not by gysse
                  Ne care not muche except he coulde some rules for chaunge of mene
                  But well I wot algates and am full sure of this
                  That I haue harde the preachers speake, of asmuche as is here
                  And of mo thynges than any man, is able to come nere.
               
               
                  But ay me thynkes it is to fyne, for such a rude vplande
                  It ware ynoughe for a ryght good clerke, at instyuynsty taught
                  He had to helpe his parysshe prest, I venture durst my hande
                  What though he coulde it dreame thus right, yet I beleue it naught
                  That he coulde with such queint prouerbes, his dreame at large endite
                  And eke I thynke the sely swayne, dyd neuer learne to wryte
               
               
                  No Watte quod the prynter tho, thou harpest on the truth
                  This Diker had a frende in court that well coulde handle pen
                  With whom he was acqueynted earst, as play felowes in youth
                  Who for they then companions ware dyd hym vouchsafe to ken
                  And loued Dauy euermore, in hym suche truth there was
                  And Dauy when he came to towne, vnsene wolde not hym pas.
               
               
                  Befell vpon a market daye, when he this dreame had had
                  That he to London lyst resort, for thynges that stode him niede
                  He founde his frende, and al this dreame, at length 
                        ••
                     to him radde
                  And he for that it semed a thynge, the pennynge worth in diede
                  Gan drawe it into frame, and shapen as ye harde
                  And one that lust it fantasien, to pryntynge it prefarde.
               
               
                  
                  Lo nowe I haue the halfe perfourmed, that I you earst behight
                  What maner man this Diker was, and howe this dreame came out
                  And nowe I wyll to Camell passe, if ye therin delight
                  By whom this ioly sturre, is chiefly brought about
                  And tell fro poynte to poynte, as earst I dyd of this
                  His worthynesse as I it knowe, and as the sayeng is.
               
               
                  The Camell semes to me to be, a great out landishe beast
                  Quod Herman to the prynter then, that longe his peace had holde
                  With bunches twayne vpon his backe, as highe as any horse at least.
                  Of which I do remenbre is, in the newe Testament tolde
                  That euery ryche gnof, may vp to heauen as easyly stye
                  As maye this wylde vnruly beast, passe through a nydles eye.
               
               
                  And eke we none in Englande haue except they bene vs brought
                  Of late that I ne knowe, out of some farre countrye
                  And by my trouth if I shall say you playnly to my thought
                  Thoughe none we had, it skylles not muche, if they so vnruly be
                  But prynter trust thou me, I nylle it not belieue
                  A beaste to speake and wryten this, my reason doth not gieue.
               
               
                  The prynter loude he loughe, and so dyd al the shoppe
                  And sayde that Herman spoken had, asmuch as myght he sayde
                  But ware the Camell here quod he, he wolde be in thy toppe
                  No force quod he▪ of beastes I am nothynge afrayde
                  Though I do selde on horsebacke come, there can no Camel kynde
                  Tyll I knowe more, lette me to say, tho fansies of my mynde.
               
               
                  Mary knowe thou then quod he, that Camell is a man
                  Nay prynter softe quod Wylkin the, and suffer me to speake
                  What cause had he that moued hym, to answer to thys whan
                  Or why shulde he of other al, so sumysshlye out breake
                  To dart at Dauye Dikers dreame that ment him none vnrest
                  Except he ware one of those sortes, that it wolde haue redrest.
               
               
                  Pardien a dreame is but a dreame, a fansye of the heade
                  And he ne ment I hope that men, shulde it for godspell take
                  But as a sweuyn or fantasie, that eche one shulde it reade
                  For thy me thynkes accordyngly, the name dyd Dauye make
                  And nowe a man (ye saye he is) agaynst a dreame to spurne
                  Me thynke it eyther smelles of craft, or els of some harte burne.
               
               
                  
                  What soft mate quod the prynter tho, and he began to lowre
                  You gynue waxe hote I wene, agaynst the somer sonne
                  Ye may be cooled ere ye come home, with some fresshe Apryl showre
                  This is to much before that I my tale haue all ydonne
                  Here fyrst an ende of all, and then prononcen dome
                  Or els depart ye calmely hence, euen such way as ye come.
               
               
                  Herman was full wo, when he, the printer sawe thus wroth
                  And had but lyttle lust to tary out the tale
                  And to his felowes gan vpbrayde, ye se the daye hence goeth
                  And eke ye knowe aswel as I, the water gynnes to vale
                  And by the vanes I spye the wynde, to be by south at west.
                  That we vs haste to Maldon meade, I thynke it be the best
               
               
                  And therfore nowe gyue vs quod he, and take thou here thy grote
                  And though that Wylkin and this Wat, haue shewed theyr hasty wyt
                  (We Maryners be salte yfrette, we can no bet god wote)
                  I pray the prynter be content and take no grefe at it
                  We haue at home a maryner that can some skyl of booke
                  He shall them see and reade them vs, and so theyr leaue they ioke.
               
               
                  And I that present was at al, for that I lyked the sporte
                  Gan prynt it in my fyckle heade, in order as I tolde
                  And for to pen it out the bet dyd to my celle resorte
                  And drewe it there into a sōme, as I had harde it tolde
                  Not with such wordes as they it spake, but in suche wordes as I
                  Had partly learned of my dame, and lyst to fantasy.
