and refreſſhed the towne with all prouiſion
parteyning to the warre: and alſo the caſtell of
Gauure / and other places vnder their rule.
            In the ſame ſeaſon there was a cōpany of rutters
gadered togyder in the wode of Reſpayle / 
and there they had fortifyed a houſe / ſo that it

theſe pyllers were borne out by them of Gaunt / 
for vnder the coloure of them they dyde moche

go in to Heynalte and take men and women in

who was called Baudrius dela Mocte / layde

There was capitayne of Bruges the lorde

Ieumount / and ſir Willyam of Namure. As
than ſir Willm̄ of Guyſtels was lorde of Dan / 
and of Courtray ſir Iohan Ieumount and ſir
Peter of Neyper. In lykewiſe in all the townes
on the fronter of Fraunce / there were men
of warre ſet by the duke of Burgoyne. In the

in Oſtrenant / the lorde of Longueuall / 
ſir Iohan Barnet / ſir Peter Baylleull / Philpot
Gany / Raoleyn dela Foley / and dyuers other.
Theſe men of armes were two hundred / 
and ſo they toke aduyſe toguyder / and were in

toke that way / and the ſame day that the frenche
men were rydden forthe / there was rydden
forthe out of Gaunt a two thouſande men mete
for the warre / and Fraūces Arreman was their
capitayne / And ſo ſodainly they mette with the
frenchmen in a village: and whan eche of them
knewe other they ſawe well they ſhuld haue batayle.
Than the frenchmen valiantly ſet fote to
the erthe and approched their ennemyes / and
the gauntoyſe in lykewiſe ſet on them. There
they beganne to ſhole and to fight eche with other:
they were on ſuche a place that the gauntoyſe
coude nat paſſe at their aduaūtage. there
was a ſore batayle and many feates of armes
done on bothe partes / and dyuers caſte to the
grounde. Sir Riflart of Flaunders was the
                  •
               
a good knight / and dyd valiantly. The knightes
and ſquyers fought valiantly with the gaū
               toyſe
/ & ſo it behoued them to do / for there was
no raunſome. But finally the gauntoyſe were
of ſuche nombre that they obteyned the place / 
and the frenchmen were conſtrayned to lepe on
their horſes or els they had been all loſt / for the
gauntoyſe ſurmounted them. And there was
ſlayne ſir Iohn̄ Varlet / ſir Peter of Bailleule
Bell Forrier / Philyppe of Gancy / Raolen dela
Foley / and dyuers other whiche was great
domage. And the other were fayne to flye and
to entre in to Ardc̄bourcke / or els they had ben
deed without recouerie. And after this aduenture
the vycount of Meaulx was ſent in garyſon
to Ardenbourcke / with a certayne nombre
of men of armes / and they newly repayred the
towne: and he had with hym a hūdred ſoeares
of good men of armes. And as than ſir Iohan
of Ieumont was great baylye of Flaunders / &

ſo he had ben two yere before. He was greatly
douted in all the countre of Flaunders bycauſe
of his valyantneſſe / And whan he might get
any of the gauntoyſe / there went no raunſome
for them: For he outher putte them to dethe / or
els cutte of their handes and fete or putte oute
their eyen and ſende them home / to gyue enſā
               ple

in Flaunders to do iuſtyce without pytie / 
in correctyng the gauntoyſe / that there was no
ſpekyng in all Flaunders but of hym.
            THus in euery Realme the worlde was

Englande as Caſtell and Portyngale for the
                  •
               
the warre was newly renewed. and the lady of

and of Hieruſalem / was come to Iuygnon to
the pope / and there kepte her houſe and her ſon
Loyes with her / who was called kynge of Cecyle / 
the whiche his father hadde conquered.
The quenes entencyon was to make warre in
Prouence / without they of that countre wolde
take her for their lady / and become vnder her
obeyſaūce. And ſir Bernarde de la Salle was
entred in to Pronence / and made warre there
in her quarell. The ſame ſeaſon ye lorde of Coucy
was alſo at Auygnon / and had layen a .xv.
wekes in his bedde / of a hurte that he hadde on
his legge with rennyng of a horſe. And whan
he was hole / than he oftentymes dyde vyſet the
quene and recōforted her / the whiche he coulde
do rightwell. The quene taryed therefor to abyde
for the duke of Berrey / who was alſo comynge
to Auignon to ſpeke with the pope / and
to ayde his ſuſter the quene. The frenche kyng
and his vncles hadde ſente in to Prouence / ſir
Loyes of Sanxere marſhall of Fraunce with
fyue hūdred men of armes to warre in that coū
               tre / 
without they wolde come to obeyſaunce vnder
the quene. Some ſubmytted themſelfe but
nat all / howe be it the cytie of Marcell / and the
gretteſt parte of the countre yelded them to the
quene / but the cytie of Ayes in Prouence / and
Tarraſton / and dyuers knyghtes of the countre
wolde nat yelde them to the quene / ſayeng:
howe ſhe had no ryght to demaunde the countie
of Prouence / tyll ſhe were peaſably receyued
for lady / and her ſonne as kynge of Pulle
and Calabre in Naples and Cecile. and whan
ſhe hath poſſeſſion of theſe / than Prouēce ſhall
obeye her / as reaſon requyreth. In thoſe matcheſſe

Iohan of Luzenbourge his ſonne. And with
me quene at Auignon as chefe of her counſayle
was ſir Iohan of Baylleule.
            IN the ſame ſeaſon there fell in Lombardye
a marueylous inſydence / which was
moche ſpoken of / throughe out all the worlde.
and that was of the Erle of Vertus / called ſir
Galeas / and of his brother ſir Barnabo / the
gretteſt in all Lombardy. They had raygned
longe and gouerned all Lōbardy lyke two bretherne.
The one of them ruled nyne cyties and
the otehr tenne. & the cyte of Millayne was gouerned
one yet by the one & thother yere by the
other. Whan ſir Galeas dyed / he left behynde
hym a ſonne / who was than erle of Vertus / &
named like his father ſir Galeas / but than ſwaged
the loue bitwene him and ſir Barnabo his
vncle / for than ſir Galeas doughted hym of ſir
Barnabo his / vncle leeſt that he wolde take away
his lādes fro him / lyke as he dyde fro his
father. For his vncle of olde tyme toke awaye
the lande fro their brother ſir Mauffe / and cauſed
him to dye. So thus therle of Vertus douted
hym greatly of his vncle. howe be it he wrought
ſubtelly to bringe hym ſelfe inſuretie / I
ſhall ſhewe you howe. Sir Barnabo had in
vſage / that all ſuche landes as he had rule of / 
he raunſomed thē ſo greuouſly and wolde taxe
the men two or thre tymes in a yere / to paye the
halfe or thirde parte of their goodes / and none
durſt ſaye agaynſt hym for feare. And ſir Galeas
erle of Vertus dyde otherwyſe / for the entent
to gete loue he toke none ayde of his men / 
but lyued all onely by his reuenewes / And that
rule he kept a fyue yere after the dethe of his father
/ ſo that he had the loue of all Lombardy / 
and euery man ſaid / they wolde be gladde to lyue
vnder hym. And euery man ſpake yuell of 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
               
Barnabo priuely as they durſt / bycauſe he toke
ſo exceſſyuely of them. So finally the Erle
of Vertus thought to execute his entent / as he
that doughted greatly his vncle / and as it was
ſayde / he ſawe ſome lykelyhode. On a day he
ſente ſecretely for ſuche as he truſted beſt / And
to ſome he ſhewed his entent / but nat to all / for
feare that his purpoſe ſhulde be knowen.
            And ſo it fortuned / that ſir Barnabo on a daye
rode forthe fro one Caſtell to another to ſporte
hym. The erle of Vertus his nephewe knewe
therof and layde for hym thre buſſhemeutes / to
the entent that his vncle ſhulde nat ſcape / for he
muſt nedes at leaſt paſſe by one of them. The
erle cōmaūded to take hym but nat to ſlee him / 

without he made great defēce. So as ſir Barnabo
roode forthe and thought none yuell / nor
was in no feare of his nephewe / So he fell in
the daunger of one of the buſſhmentes / the whiche
opyned and approched hym with their ſperes
couched in the reſt. ſir Barnabo had with
hym a ſquyer of Almaygne / who came to hym
and ſayd. Sir / ſaue your ſelfe / for yonder company
maketh but yuell countenaunce agaynſt
you / they are parteyning to youre nephewe ſir
Galeas / Sir Barnabo aunſwered / I knowe
nat howe to ſaue my ſelfe / if they owe me any
yuell wyll / But I haue done no treſpaſſe to my
nephue / wherby that I ought to flye awaye. ſo
alwayes they of the buſſhement drewe nerer &
nerer ſtreight vpon hym. There was a knight
of Almaygne with ſir Barnabo / and whan he
ſawe this company approche towarde his maiſter:
He had ſir Barnabos ſwerde in his hāde
and drewe it oute of the ſheth / and tooke it his
maiſter and ſayd. Sir / defende your ſelfe / and
than the knight drewe out his owne ſwerde lyke
a valyant man to ſtande at his defence / how
be it all aueyled hym no thyng / For incōtynent
he was enuyroned / and his mayſter alſo with
their ennemyes. and the ſayd knight was the
                  •
               
ſlayne / bycauſe he putte hym ſelfe to defence / 
wherof ſir Galeas was afterwarde ryght ſore
diſpleaſed. So ſir Barnabo was there taken
for he made no defence / nor none of his men / &
ſo he was brought to a caſtell whe
                  •
                his nephue
was / who was gladde of his comynge. The
ſame day 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Barnabos wyfe and chyldren were
taken / who were to mary / and they were kepte
in Myllayne in priſon. Than ſir Galeas toke
all the ſeignories / townes and caſtels / that parteyned
to ſir Barnabo in all Lombardy to his
poſſeſſyon: and his vncle dyed I can nat ſaye
howe. I thynke he was lette blode in the necke
accordynge to the blode lettyng in Lombardy
whan they wyll auaūce a mannes ende. Anone
theſe tidynges ſprang abrode / ſome were glad
therof and ſome were ſorte. For this ſir Barnabo
hadde done in his tyme / many cruell and
horryble dedes / and pytuous iuſtyce withoute
reaſon / ſo that but fewe people complayned his
trouble / but ſayde / He hadde well deſerued it.
thus ended ſir Barnabo / who had in his dayes
raygned puiſſauntly in Lombardy.
            ¶Nowe lette vs retourne to the duke of Burbons
and the Erle of Marcheſſe army / & what
they dyde in Poictou and in Lymoſyn.
            
               THey depted fro Moleyns in Burbonoyſe
/ and ſo rode forthe with
great reuell: And the duke had in
his company his nephewe Iohan
of Harcourte. The ſpecyall nombre
of his army came out of Berry / Auuergne / 
Poictou / Rouergue / Xaynton / and Lymoſyn / 
And they met togider at Nyorte / a .xii. leages
fro Poicters. In this meane ſeaſon ſir Wyllm̄
of Lynacke / a right valyant knyght ſeneſchall
of Xaynton / who was as than gouernoure of
Myllayne (in thoſe marcheſſe) and ſo he came
in to Angoulinoys / with a certayne nombre of
men of armes / a two hundred: He reſted before
the caſtell of the Egle / in the whiche were Engliſhemen.
And all the wynter and ſomer paſt
before had greatly domaged the countre. than
this ſir Wyllyam lyghted a fote / and ſo dyd all
his cōpany / and valyantly aſſayled the caſtell.
It was a ſore aſſaute and well contynued / for
they within defēded them ſelfe for feare of their
lyues. Sir Wylliam hym ſelfe that day dyde
right nobly / and gaue enſample howe his men
ſhulde aſſayle withoute any ſparynge. This
aſſaut was ſo well contynued / that the Caſtell
was taken byforce: the Frenche men entred in
by ladders / & all that were within ſlayne and
taken. Thus this ſir Wylliam of Lygnac dyde
the firſt enterpriſe in that ſeaſon / abydinge for
the duke of Burbone and his route.
            
               wHan the duke of Burbone was come
to Nyorte / and his company: There
he founde a great nombre of men of
warre / abydinge for hym. And there was redy
his coſyn the erle of Marche / with a great nō
               bre
/ and alſo the Vycount of Tonnere / and ſir
Henry of Thouars ſeneſchall of Lymoſyn / the
lorde of Pons / the lorde of Parteney / the lorde
of Thouars / the lorde of Puyſſaunce / and dyuers
other barons of Poytou and of Xaynton.
And than ſir William of Lignacke came to the
duke / who had newly wonne the Caſtell of the
Egle / wherfore the duke gaue hym great thankes.
Whan all theſe men of warre were aſſembled
toguyder / they were a ſeuyn hundred ſpeares
beſyde the Geneuoys and other varlettes:
They were in nombre two thouſande fightynge
men. Thaſie they toke aduyſe whyder they
ſhulde go / outher to Vertuell or to Taylboure
or to Mountlewe. And all thynges conſydered
/ they determyned to go to Mountlewe / by
cauſe it was a caſtell / ſtandyng on the laundes

of Burdeaur. They thought if they might get
that caſtell
                  •
                all other ſhulde be the more eaſyer
to wynne. And alſo / than ſhulde no man come
out of Burdeaur without their knowledge. ſo
they rode thyderwarde and paſſed Angoleſme
and ſo came before Mountlewe / and they layd
their ſiege. The chefe leaders of all the dukes
hooſt / was ſir Iames Pounſarte / and Iohan
Bonne Launce. Incontynent they made redy
to aſſyle the caſtell / and ſo enuyroned the caſtell
aboute / and gaue aſſaulte with great courage / 
and they within defended them ſelfe valiantly.
Surely there was an harde aſſaute &
well contynued / and many a proper dede of armes
done / For the frenchmen dilygently moū
               ted
vp on their ladders / and fought with daggers
hande to hande on the walles. So moche
dyde the frenche men / that by pure aſſaute they
wan the caſtell / and they within ſlayne / There
were but a fewe that were ſaued. Whan the frē
the men had poſſeſſion of Moūtlewe / they new
lye furuyſſhed it with men of warre and other
prouiſyon. And than they toke the waye to tayl
bourcke / of the whiche fortereſſe Dynaudon of
Perat was capitayne / a proper man of armes
he made but lytell counte of the frenchmen. and
whyle the duke laye at ſiege before this caſtell / 
his company wanne two lytell fortreſſes / whiche
had ſore harryed the fronters of Poictou &
Lymoſyn / by reaſon of the Englyſſ
                  •
               men that
were in them. Theſe two fortreſſes were called
Troucet and Archat / and all that were within
were ſlayne / and the caſtelles delyuered to thē
of the countre / and they dyde beate thē downe
to the grounde.

Cap. ſecundo.
            
               THus the ſiege was layd
before Tailbourcke by four
baſtedes▪ there was in Tail
bourcke a bridge on the ryuer
of Charent / and the Englyſſhe
men and Gaſcoyns
had well fortifyed it / ſo that
all the ſeaſon before they coude no ſhyppe paſſe
to Rochell nor in to Xaynton / without daūger
or by truage. Than the frenche lordes aduyſed
to wynne the bridge to haue the leſſe to do / and
to lye the more ſurer in their baſtydes. They
cauſed to come to Rochellſhippes by the ryuer
of Charent / and in theym certayne Geneuoys
and croſbowes / and made them to ſcrymyſſhe
with them of the bridge. There was a ſore aſſaute / 
for the Englyſſhe men and gaſcons had
ryght well fortifyed the bridge / and valyantly
dyde defende thēſelfe / So they were aſſayled
by lande and by ryuer. ¶Iohan the ſonne
of the erle of Harcourt was there made knight
and reyſed his baner / the duke of Burbone his
vncle made him knight. This aſſault was well
cōtinued / and many a feate of armes the
                  •
                done
the Geneuoys and croſbowes that were in the
ſhyppes ſhotte ſo rudely and ſo hole toguyder
at them on the bridge / that none of them durſte
ſcantely ſhewe any defence. What ſhulde I make
longe tale? By force of aſſault the bridge on
the ryuer was wonne / and all that were foūde
theron ſlayne and drowned / none ſcaped. thus
the french men had the bridge of Taylbourc / 
their ſiege was the eaſyer. It was but thre leages
fro faynt Iohn̄s Dangle / and two leages
fro Xauntes / in the beſt countre of the worlde.
            OF the loſſe of Tayllebourke / they within
Dynaudon & other were ſore diſmayed / 
as they had good cauſe / for they had loſt therby
the paſſage of the ryuer / howe be it yet they
wolde nat yelde them. They thought thēſelfe
in a ſtronge place / and truſted on ſome reſcue
fro Burdeaux / For it was ſhewed in all thoſe
fronters and englyſſhe fortereſſes / that the duke
of Lancaſtre / or elles the erle of Buckyngham
with two thouſande men of armes & four
thouſande archers / ſhulde come to Burdeaux
to fyght with the frenche men / and to reyſe all
their ſiege. Of this they greatly truſted / but it
fortuned otherwyſe / as I ſhall ſhewe you. It

               guedocke / 
and to fight with the Frenche men / 
if they founde them in the countrey. And after
that they had taryed there a ſeason / than to haue
gone fro thens in to Caſtell / to Bayon / and
to Nauarre: For they were in treatie with the
kyng of Nauer. This was ymagined in Englāde / 
but all tourned to nought / for whan they
knewe the certaynte that the admyrall of Fraū
               ce / 
with a thouſande ſpeares of choſen knightes
and ſquyers were come in to Scotlande.
Than they chaunged their purpoſe / and durſt
ſende none of their men oute of the realme / for
they doughted greatly the dedes of the frenche
men and Scottes / ioyned toguyder. Alſo the
ſame tyme there ranne a voyce through all Englande / 
howe they ſhulde be the ſame Somer
aſſayled with the frenchmen in thre ꝑtes. One
by Bretaygne. for the duke there was become
frenche: And another by Normandye / for the
whiche (as it was ſayd) The conſtable of Frā
               ce
made his prouiſyon at Harflewe and Depe / 
and ſo a longe the Sceſyde to ſaynt Valeries
and to Crotoy: And the thirde by the Scottes
ſo that for dought of this / they wolde ſuffre no
knightes nor ſquyers to go out of Englande / 
but made prouiſyon to defende their hauyns &
portes of the ſee. The ſame ſeaſon the Erle of
Arundell Richarde was admyrall of the See / 
and was on the See / with a thre or foureſcore
great ſhyppes / furnyſſhed with men of armes
and archers. And he hadde ſmall ſhippes that
ranne in and oute / and viewed the boundes of
the yles of Normandy to knowe tidynges.
            ¶Nowe lette vs leaue to ſpeke of the duke of
Burbone and of the ſiege of Tayllebourcke / 
where as he laye a nyne wekes: & let vs ſhewe
howe the admyrall of Fraūce toke lande in the
realme of Scotlande / and what chere they had
made to them at their firſte lodgynge.
            
               tHe Frenche army that went in to ſcotlande
had wynde at wyll. It was in
the monethe of Maye / whan the waters
be peaſeable and meke / and the ayre ſofte
and ſwete. Firſt they coſted Flāders / Holande
zelande / and Friſe: and at laſt aproched to the
ſight of Scotlande. But are they aryued / the
                  •
               
fell an harde aduenture / to a yonge knyght of
Fraunce a proper man of armes / called ſir Aubert
Dāgyers. The knyght was yong and of
haute courage / and to ſhewe his ſtrength and
lyghtneſſe of body / he lepte vp clene armed on
the walle of the ſhyppe / and in the lightynge / 
his fete ſlypped / and ſo fell ouer the borde in to
the ſee / ſo that he coulde nat be holpen: For incōtynent
he ſanke downe / bycauſe of ye weight
of his harnes / & alſo the ſhip ſayled euer forthe.
Of this knightes aduenture / all the barownes
and knyghtes were ſore dyſpleaſed / but there
was no remedy. And ſo longe they ſayled that
they arryued at Edenborowe / the chiefe towne
in Scotlande. And whe
                  •
                as the kyng in tyme
of peace mooſt cōmenly laye. And as ſoone as
the erle Duglas and the Erle Morette knewe
of their cōmynge / they wente to the hauyn and
mette with them / and receyued them ſwetely:
Sayeng / howe they were right welcome in to
that countrey: And the barons of Scotlande / 
knewe ryght well ſir Geffray de Charney / for
he had been the ſomer before two monethes in
their company: ſir Geffray acquaynted them
with the Admyrall / and the other knyghtes of
Fraunce. As at that tyme the kynge of Scottes
was nat there / for he was in the wylde ſcottyſſhe:
But it was ſhewed theſe knight
                  •
                / howe
the kyng wolde be there ſhortly / wherwith they
were well content: and ſo were lodged there about
in the vyllages. For Edenborough / thoughe
the kynge kepte there his chefe reſydence
and that it is Parys in Scotlāde / yet it is nat
lyke Tourney or Valencēnes / for in all the towne
there is nat foure thouſande houſes. Therfore
it behoued theſe lordes and knyghtes to be
lodged about in vyllages: As at Donfer / Me
lyne / Caſtell / Dōbare / Alueſt / and ſuche other.
Anone tidynges ſprange about in Scotlande
that a great nombre of men of armes of Fraū
               ce
were come into their countre. Some therat
dyde murmure and grudge / and ſayde: Who
the deuyll hath ſente for theym? What do they
here? Can nat we maynteyne our warre with
Englande well ynoughe withoute their helpe?
We ſhall do no good as longe as they be with
vs? Let it be ſhewed vnto them / that they may
retourne agayne? And that we be ſtronge ynough
in Scotlande to maynteyne our warre
without theym: And therfore we wyll none of
their company. They vnderſtande nat vs nor

we them / therfore we can nat ſpeke toguyder.
They wyll anone ryffle / and eate vp all that euer
we haue in this countrey. They ſhall doo
vs more diſpytes and domages / than thoughe
the Englyſſhe men ſhulde fyght with vs. For
thoughe the Englyſſhe men brinne our houſes
we care lytell therfore / We ſhall make them agayne
chepe ynough / We axe but thre dayes to
make them agayne / if we maye geate foure or
fyue ſtakes and bowes to couer them.

            ¶Howe the Frenche men founde a
wylde countrey of Scotlande / and
were yuell content with thadmyrall
and howe he pacifyed thē with fayre
wordes: And howe Fraunces Atreman
and his company had nere hande
taken Ardenbourcke in Flaūders.
Cap. iii.
            
               THus the ſcottes ſayde
in Scotlande / at the comynge
of the frenchmen thyder / 
for they dyde ſette nothynge
by them / but hated them in
their courage and diframed
theym in their language / as
moche as they myght / lyke rude people without
hououre as they be. All thynges conſydered
/ It was to great an armye of ſo many noble
men to come in to Scotlande / and knewe
no reaſon why / a twentie or thrittie knyghtes
of Fraunce / had been better than all that nombre
of fyue hūdred or a thouſande / and the cauſe
why is this.
            ¶In Scotlande ye ſhall fynde no man light / 
lye of honoure nor gentylneſſe: They be lyke
wylde and ſauage people: They wyll be with
no man acquaynted / and are greatly enuyous
with the honoure or profyte of any other man / 
and they dought euer to leſe that they haue / for
it is a poore countre. And whan the Englyſſhe
men maketh any roode or voyage in to the coū
               trey
/ as they haue done often before this tyme / 
If they thynke to lyue / they muſte cauſe their
prouyſion and vitayle to folowe theym at their
backe / for they ſhall fynde nothyng in that coū
               trey
but with moche payne. Nor they ſhall fynde
none yron to ſhowe their horſes / nor leddar
to make harneſſe / ſadelles / or bridelles: For all
ſuche thynges cometh to them redy made oute
of Flaunders. And whan that prouiſyon fayleth
/ there is none to gette in the countrey.
            Whan the barownes and knightes of Fraunce
who were wonte to fynde fayre hoſtryes / halles
hanged / and goodly caſtelles and ſofte beddes
to reſte in: Sawe them ſelfe in that neceſſite:
they began to ſmyle / and ſaid to the admyrall.
Sir / What pleaſure hath brought vs hyder?
We neuer knewe what pouertie ment tyll
nowe? We fynde nowe / the olde ſayengꝭ of our
fathers and mothers true: Whan̄e they wolde
ſaye. Go your waye: and ye lyue long / ye ſhall
fynde harde and poore beddes / whiche nowe
we fynde. Therfore / lette vs go oure voyage
that we be come for. Lette vs ryde in to Englā
               de:
The longe taryenge here in Scotlande / is
to vs / nother honourable nor profytable. The
admyrall apeaſed them as well as he myght / &
ſayde. Sirs / it behoueth vs to ſuffre a lytell / 
and to ſpeke fayre / ſithe we be in this daunger.
We haue a great longe waye yet to paſſe / and
by Englande we can nat retourne: Therfore
lette vs take in gree that we fynde / We can nat
be alwayes at Parys or Dygeon / at Beautie
or at Chalous. It behoueth them that wyll lyue
in this worlde / thynkynge to haue honoure / 
to ſuffre ſomtyme as well pouertie as welth.
            
               THus ſir Iohan of Vien admyrall
of Fraunce / apeaſed to his companyons
/ with theſe wordes and ſuche
other / whiche I can nat all reherce
They acquaynted them as mothe
as they might with the barownes of Scotlande
/ but they were viſyted by them but very lytell:
For as I haue ſayde before / there is in thē
lytell honour / & of all people yuell to be aquaynted
withall. The mooſt company that the frenche
men had was the erle Duglas and the erle
Morette. Theſe two lordes dyde theym more
ſolace / than all the reſydue of Scotlande. yet
there was another thyng that was right harde
to the frenchmen / For whan they were in Scotlande
and wolde ryde they foūde horſes to dere
for that that was nat worthe tenne florens they
coude nat bye vnder threſcore or a hūdred / and
yet with moche payne to gette any for money / 
and yet whan they had any horſes / than hadde
they nother harneſſe / ſadell / nor bridell / without
they had brought it with them out of Flaū
               ders.
In this trouble and daunger were the

frenchemen: yea and moreouer / Whan̄e their
varlettes went forthe a forragynge / and hadde
charged their horſes with ſuche as they coulde
gette / In their retouruynge home / the ſcottes
them ſelfe laye in wayte for theym / and all that
they had taken from them / and they well beten
and ſome ſlayne: ſo that there was none that
durſte go a forragynge for feare to be ſlayne.
For in a moneth the frenche men loſte of their
varlettes mo than a hundred: For if they went
forthe thre or foure toguyder / they neuer returned
agayne. Thus the frenche men were handeled:
And beſyde that / the kynge of Scottes
was deſyred to comeforthe / and ſo were the other
lordes / knightes / and ſquyers of the realme.
But they aunſwered and ſayd: Howe they
wolde make no warre in to Englande / as at
that tyme. And that they ſayd / to thentent that
the Frenche men ſhulde paye well for their comyng.
For or the kyng wolde come out of the
wylde ſcottyſſhe to Edenboroughe / he demaū
               ded
to haue a great ſomme of money / for hym
and for his people: And the admyrall of Fraū
               ce
was ſayne to promyſe and to ſeale / that the
kynge ſhulde haue a certayne ſomme of money
or he and his company auoyded the Realme:
It he had nat done thus / he ſhulde haue hadde
none ayde of the ſcottes: He was fayne to make
that marchaundiſe or elles a worſe. And yet
whan he had made the beſt accorde and a
                  •
               oyntment
that he coude make with theym / he hadde
by them but lytell profyte nor helpe / as ye ſhall
here further in the hyſtorie.
            ¶But nowe a lytell I wyll retourne and tell
of the aduentures of Flaunders and of the maryage
of the yonge frenche kyng / and howe Ardenbourcke
hadde nere been taken by ſtelthe / 
where as the Vycont of Meaulx and ſir Iohn̄
of Ieumont laye in garyſon.
            
               AFter the diſconfyture that ſir Ryflarte
of Flaunders had made in
the lande of the foure craftes with
out Gaunt / than he came to Ardē
               bourcke:
And thyder was ſente in
garyſon ſir Robert of Bethune vycoūt of Meaulx
/ and there he foūde ſir Iohan of Iumont
and his company: And thyder was ſente a .xl.
ſpeares knightes and ſquiers / ſuche as deſyred
to ſeke aduentures. Whan̄e the Vycount was
come thider / he entended to fortify and repayre
the towne in all poyntes. Fraunces Atreman
and they of Gaunte / ſubtelly ymagyned night
and day / howe they might anoye and do domage
to their enemyes / as they ſhewed rightwell
to their neighbours / as And warp / Teremōde
Ardenbourcke / Bruges / Danne
                  •
                and Scluſe.
They euer ymagined / howe to wynne any of
them by crafte: And to ſay the trouth / they had
ſuche cōpany as were mete to execute ſuche dedes.
So it fortuned / about the ende of Maye
Fraūces Atreman and a ſeuyn thouſande with
hym departed fro Gaunt / to thentent to wynne
Ardenbourke by ſtelth / and all the knightꝭ and
ſquyers therin: And ſpecially they deſyred to
haue the capitayne ſir Iohan Iumont / bycauſe
he had done them many great domages / as
in takyng and ſleyng / and puttyng out of their
cyen / and cuttyng of handes / fete / and eares of
their men. So thus on a Wedniſdaye aboute
the dawnynge of they day / they came to Ardē
               bourcke
/ and had with them ſcalynge leddars
redy. The Vycounte of Meaulx / ſir Iohan Iumount
/ ſir Ryflarte of Flaunders / the lorde of
Damert / ſir Tercelette of Montigny / and ſir
Parducas of Pount ſaint Marke / the lorde of
Langueuall and ſir Iohan his ſonne / ſir Hewe
Deſnell / the lorde de Lalayne / ſir Reynolde of
Lōmye / and dyuers other lay ſlepyng in their
beddes / on truſt of the watche. Nowe beholde
what aduēture they were in. The watche that
had watched all nyght / was as than departed / 
and their reliefe nat come as than. The ſame
ſeaſon Fraunces Atreman & the gaūtoiſe with
their ladders were redy come in to the dikes / &
ſo cāe to the walles & dreſſed vp their ladders / 
and began to mount. The ſame ſeaſon by aduēture
/ there was walkynge within the wall / the
lorde of ſaynt Albyne / and with hym a ſquyer
of Picardy named Enguerant zēdequyn a picarde
with a moreſpike. I thynke they had ben
of the watche the ſame night / & was nat as than
departed / To ſay the trouthe and they had nat
ben / Ardenbourcke had been taken / and all the
knightes in their beddes.

Enouerant zendequyn ſaued Ardenbourke
fro takyng / & how the quene
of Hungry ſente ambaſſadours in to
Fraunce / to mary therle of Voloyes
to her eldeſt doughter. Capi. iiii.
            
               
               WHan ſir Gouſſeaux of
ſaynt Martyne and Enguerant
zendequen: ſawe howe
the gauntoyſe mounted vp
the walles by ladders / and
they ſaw wher ther was one
puttynge his legge ouer the
wall to haue entred in to the towne▪ they were
thā ſore abaſſhed / but yet nat ſo moche but that
they toke conforte to them ſelfe: For they ſawe
well if they fledde / the towne were loſt without
recouery▪ for they parceyued well that theyr entryng
was bytwene the departyng of the watche
/ and the comynge of the reliefe. Than Enguerant
ſayd to the mores pyke: Seppe on forwarde:
Beholde yonder the gauntoyſe are entrynge
/ helpe to defende vs / or elles the towne
is loſte. And ſo they thre went to the ſame place
where as they ſawe the gauntoyſe entrynge / 
and the Pycarde with the mores pyke / ſtrake
hym that was entrynge ouer the wall ſuche a
ſtroke / that he hare hym clene fro the wall and
ladder / and ſo fell downe in to the dyke. & therwith
the watche aroſe / & ſawe howe there were
in the dykes and there aboute / a great batayle
of the gauntoyſe. Than̄e he ſowned his trumpette:
Treaſon treaſon. Therwith the towne
ſtyrred euery man oute of their beddes / & harkened
to the crye / and ſawe howe the gaunte is
wolde haue ſtollen their towne. Than they armed
them as faſt as they might: howe be it for
all this the gauntoyſe dyde all their beſt to haue
entred in to their towne. And the ſayde thre
perſones valyantly defended the walles / more
than the ſpace of halfe an hour / agaynſt all the
comers the whiche turned to their great prayſe.
Than̄e the other lordes and knightes came
thyder in good array / as the Vycount of Meaulx
with his bauer before hym / ſir Iohan of
Ieumont his penon before hym / and ſir Ryflarte
of Flaunders / and other: and they founde
the knight / the ſquyer / and the mores pyke / 
fightynge and defendynge the walles. Than̄e
they cryed their cryes to the reſcue. And whan
Fraunces Atreman and the gauntoyſe parceyued
the matter / and howe they hadde fayled of
their ententes / they withdrewe themſelfe fayre
and caſely / and reculed their people / and ſo departed
and retourned in to the rule of the four
craftes. And ſo than they of the garyſon of Ardenbourke
toke more hede to the kepyng of the
towne than they dyde before / and they honoured
greatly among them / the foreſaid thre perſones
/ for and they had nat been / the towne had
ben loſte and all their throtes cutte.
            
               yE haue herde here before / howe the duke
of Aniou / who called hym ſelfe kynge
of Naples / of Cecyle / and of Hieruſalem
/ made warre thre yeres / In Pule / Calabre
/ and in Naples / agaynſt ſir Charles dela
Paix: and in the makynge of that warre he
dyed / and in lykewiſe ſo dyde ſir Charles dela
Paix. Some ſayd he was ſlayne in the realme
of Hungry by the conſentment of the quene / for
after the dethe of the kyng of Hungry / bycauſe
this ſir Charles was ſonne to the kynges brother
/ therfore he maynteyned that the Realme
ſhulde fall to hym: For his vncle the kynge of
Hungry after his dethe / lefte behynde hym but
doughters. So therfore the quene feared leeſt
he wolde diſheryte her doughters: And therfore
(as it was ſayd) ſhe cauſed this ſir Charles
dela Paix to be ſlayne / of whoſe dethe ther
was had great marueyle / & ſo therby the quene
was ſore enforſed / and of her yonge ſonne the
kyng beyng at Auignon / & ſo they made wary
in Prouence / the kynge of Hungry lyuenge.
The barons and prelates of Hungry coūſayled
hym to gyue Margarete his eldeſt doughter
/ whiche was likely to be a great enheritour
to Loyes of Fraunce erle of Valoyes ſonne / &
brother to the frenche kynge / bycauſe they thought
he ſhulde than abyde among them in Hū
               gry.
And whan the kynge was deed / they ſent
ambaſſadours in to Fraunce to the kynge and
to his vncles / ſhewyng howe the quene of Hungry
wolde haue for her eldeſt doughter the erle
of Valoyes. This requeſt ſemed to the kynge
and to his vncles and to the barons of Fraunce
/ to be right noble and profitable / excepte one
thynge. They thought therby / that the erle of
Valoyes ſhulde be very farre of fro his owne
nacion / Howe be it all thynges conſydred / they
thought it a noble and a right profitable thyng
for the erle of Valoyes to be kyng of Hungry / 
the whiche is one of the gretteſt realmes in cryſtendome.
So theſe ambaſſadours were gretly
feeſted and nobly receyued / and to thē gyuen
many great gyftes: And ſo agayne with them
there went to Hūgry other ambaſſ. out of Fraū
               ce:
As the byſſhop of Maylleretꝭ and ſir Iohn̄
la Parſon / who by ꝓcuracyon generall / whan
they were come in to Hūgry / he wedded in the
name of the erle of Valoyes the lady Margarete
/ and thanne the byſſhoppe retourned in to

Fraūce. And alſo ſir Iohan Parſon / who had
wedded the lady and lyen by her a bedde / curteſly
/ accordynge to the cuſtome in ſuche matters
requyred. And of this whan he came in to
Fraunce / he ſhewed letters patentes & publyke
inſtrumentes / ſo that they of Fraūce were well
content. And ſo longe after / the erle of Valoys
wrote hymſelfe kyng of Hungry.
            ALſo ye haue herde / how the duke of burgoyne
and the duke Aubert of Bauier / 
lorde of Heynalte / Hollande zelande / & Friſe / 
had maryed their chyldren at Cambray toguyder
/ At which maryage the frenche kyng was
with great tryumphe. Some ſayde / howe the
ſame tyme that the frenche kynge and his vncles:
the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of Burbone
/ and the duke Aubert were there at Cambray
/ & the lady of Burgoyne / the lady of Brabant
/ and the lady of Heynalte. Howe that by
the procurement of the ducheſſe of Brabante / 
there was ſecretely a treatie of maryage moued
bytwene the yonge kyng Charles of Fraū
               ce
and the lady Iſabell / doughter to duke Stephyn
of Bauyer. For kyng Charles of Fraunce
that laſte dyed before in his dethe bedde / he
ordayned / that Charles his ſonne ſhulde be maryed
in to Almaygne / if they ſawe any place cō
               uenyent
/ wherby the almayns ſhulde be alyed
to Fraūce: For he ſawe well / howe the kyng of
Englande was maryed to the kyng of Almaynes
ſuſter / wherby he ſpedde moche the better.
This ducheſſe of Brabant / who was a ryght
ſore ymaginatyue lady / ſhewed many reaſons
to the kynges vncles / and to his counſayle: ſayenge
/ howe this lady was doughter to a great
lorde in Almaygne / and the greatteſt of all the
Bauyers. And howe that thereby / they ſhulde
haue great alyaunce in Almaygne / For duke
Stephyn (ſhe ſayde) was ſo great a manne / 
that he myght well breke the purpoſes of the
great lordes of thempyre / For he was as great
or greatter / than the kynge of almaygne / the
whiche enclyned ſoneſt the counſayle of Fraū
               ce
/ to parceyuer in that mater / Howe be it the
matter was handeled right ſecretely / For there
were but fewe that knewe therof tyll it were
doone: And the cauſe why this was. It is the
vſage in Fraunce / that any lady doughter to any
great lorde / yf the Kynge ſhulde mary her / 
firſte ſhe ſhulde be ſene and viewed all naked / 
by certayne ladyes therto admytted / to knowe
if ſhe were proper and mete to brynge forthe
chyldren: and alſo bycauſe this lady was of a
farre countre / ſo that if ſhe ſhulde be pleaſaunt
to the kyng or nat / or elles all were broken. for
theſe cauſes the matter was kepte ſecrete / but
the lady about the feeſt of Penthecoſt after / ſhe
was brought to Brabant to the ducheſſe there / 
who ioyfully receyued her and ordered her / accordynge
to the vſage of Fraunce. And with
her in company was duke Frederyke of Bauyer
her vncle / by whom to ſaye trouthe the maryage
was firſte procured / by ſuche wayes as
I ſhall ſhewe you.

kynge with her neſe Iſabell of Bauyer:
And howe the duke and the lady
came to Queſnoy. Cap. v.
            
               WHan that duke Frederyke
of Bauier cāe firſt in to Frā
               ce
to ſerue the frēche: kyng in
his iourney that he made in
to flaunders / and came to
the ſiege of Boutbourcke.
True it was / he was feeſted
and receyued by the kynges vncles / bycauſe he
was come ſo farre of to ſerue the kynge / as out
of the coūtre of Bauyer / the whiche was more
than two hundred leages of. This was reputed
for a great ſeruyce / and he was alwayes loged
nere to the kyng / in token of good loue and
fauour. And whan he departed out of Bauyer
he thought ſurly that there ſhulde be batayle
bytwene the Frenche kyng and the kyng of Englande
/ in the marcheſſe of Flaūders or of fraū
               ce
/ for ſo ranne all the brute in all Almaygne.
Therfore the kynge and his vncles gaue hym
the more thanke. And thus as he was with the
kyng in that voyage before Burbourke & Bergues
/ the kingꝭ vncles curteſly demaūded on a
day of hym / if he had any doughters to mary▪
ſayeng / howe they lacked a wyfe for the kyng / 
and howe that they had rather the kynge ſhulde
mary in Bauyer / rather than̄e in any other
place / For aunciently the buyers were of the
counſayle of Fraunce. The duke aunſwered
and ſayd: ſurely I haue no doughter to mary / 
but myne elder brother / duke Stephyn of Bauyer

hath a right fayre Lady to his doughter.
Of what age is ſhe of quod the lordes? Bytwene.
xiii. and fourtene quod the duke. That
is all that we deſyre / quod the kynges vncles.
Therfore ſir / whan ye do retourne home in to
Bauyer ſpeke to your brother of the mater: &
bring your neſe a pylgrimage to ſaynt Iohn̄s
of Amyence / & the kyng ſhalbe there if it pleaſe
hym. We drynke he wyll deſyre it / for he loueth
gladly to ſe fayre thynges. and if he wyſſhe to
haue her / ſhe ſhall be quene: So this was the
firſt procurement: and as at yt tyme there was
no more done nor ſayde. The kynge knewe no
thynge of theſe wordes. And whan̄e this duke
Federyke of Bauyer was retourned home / he
ſhewed all this mater to duke Stephyn of Bauyer
his brother / who ſtudyed ſomewhat at his
wordes / and at laſt ſayd: Fayre brother / I beleue
well it is as ye ſaye. My doughter ſhulde
be happy if ſhe myght come to ſo highe an honour / 
as to be frenche quene: But Fraunce is
very farre of / and it is a matter wiſely to be regarded / 
to make a Quene. I ſhulde be ryght
ſoore diſpleaſed / if my doughter ſhulde be caryed
in to Fraūce for ſuche a purpoſe / and than
ſente home agayne. yet I had rather mary her
at myne eaſe / nerer home. This was the aunſwere
that duke Stephyn gaue to his brother
duke Frederyke / where with duke Frederyke
was well content / and wrote all his aunſwere
to Fraunce to the Kynges vncles and to his vncle
duke Auberte / and to the Duches of Brabant.
They hadde went that duke Frederyke
had forgoten the matter For they were aboute
maryages for the kynge in other places. And
the kynge was nere agreed to the doughter of
the duke of Lorayne / for ſhe was a fayre damoſell
of her age, nere to the kyngꝭ age. She was
of noble and great generacyon of the houſe of
Bloyes. Alſo there was ſpekyng for the doughter
of the Duke of Lancaſtre / who was after
quene of Portyngale: but there was no cōcluſion / 
bycauſe of the warre. Therfore the matter
hanged ſtyll in ſuſpence (& as ye haue herde
before) The duches of Brabant whā ſhe was
at Camb
                  •
               ay / at the maryages of Burgoyne &
Heynalte: and that the frenche kyng was they
and the duke of Burbone and Burgoyn were
there / Than ſhe moued forthe this maryage of
Bauyer / for the kyng affirmynge that it was
mooſt profitable and honorable for the kynge / 
bycauſe of the alyaunce with Almaygne. Madame
quod the kynges vncles / we here nothynge
therof. Well quod the ducheſſe / I warrant
you ye ſhall here ſomwhat therof / or this ſomer
be paſte. Her promyſe was well fulfylled / for
ſhe dyde ſo moche / that duke Frederyke / vncle
to the damoſell was ſo agreed with his brother
duke Stephyn / that he ſhulde be conuey the lady
in to Fraunce: And that it ſhulde be noyſed all
the waye / that they went a pylgrimage to ſaīt
Iohans of Amyence. Euery man ſuppoſed the
ſame / for Almayns go the often on pylgrimage
it is their vſage.
            
               wHan duke Frederyke and his neſe the
lady Iſabell of Bauyer / had ben thre
dayes at Bruſels / than they toke leue / 
but it was the ducheſſe intenſyon to be as ſoone
at Amyence / or ſoner than they. So than they
came in to Heynaulte to Queſnoy / where they
founde the duke and the ducheſſe / and ſir Wyllyam
erle of Oſtrenaunt and his wyfe. There
thy were nobly receyued for duke Aubert was
her vncle / and had great marueyle what brought
them in to that countre: And than demaū
               ded
why they came thyder? Certaynlye quod
duke Frederyke / I haue had moche payne to
bringe the mater to this purpoſe: And ſo there
he ſhewed hym all the mater / and ſayd. I haue
brought my brother in that mynde / that I haue
brought my neſe hyder as ye ſaye / but whan
I departed my brother ſayd to me. Nowe Frederike
my fayre brother / ye leade with you Iſabell
my doughter without any ſure eſtate / For
if the frenche kyng wyll refuſe her / than is ſhe
ſhamed for euer / therfore aduyſe you well: For
if the matter come nat well to paſſe / ye ſhall haue
me your enemy for euer. Therfore fayre vncle / 
ye maye ſe what daunger I haue putte my
ſelfe in. Than duke Aubert ſayd: fayre nephue
be nat diſmayde / for by the pleaſure of god / ſhe
ſhalbe the frenche quene / and than̄e ſhall ye be
quyte / & haue the loue of duke Stephyn your
brother.
            THus they taryed at Queſnoy the ſpace
of thre wekes / and ye ducheſſe who was
ſage / endoctryned the yonge damoſell of Bauyer / 
in maner and in countenaunce / and chaū
               ged
her appayrell / for ſhe was but ſimplye arrayed / 
after the ſtate of Fraunce: Thanne ſhe
arrayed her / as thoughe ſhe had ben her owne
doughter. And whan euery thyng was redy / ye
duches and the damoſelle rode forthe / tyll they
came to Amience. And by that tyme was come
thyder / the duches of Burgoyne and of Brabant / 
and alſo the frenche kynge and his counſayle / 

The lorde de la Ryuer and ſit Guy de la
Tremoyle. Barownes and knightꝭ iſſued out
of Amyence to mete and receyue them of Heynalte.
Thus they were brought in to Amyence
and had moche honoure done to them / and the
lordes and ladyes eche of theym dyde vyſite other
louyngly. But with moche payne the kynge
might ſlepe / for the inwarde deſyre yt he had
to ſe her that ſhulde be his wyfe. And he demaū
               ded
of the lorde de la Ryuer whan he ſhulde ſe
her. of thoſe wordes the ladies had great ſporte
ſo that the Fridaye whan the damoſell was redy / 
the thre ducheſſes ledde the damoſell to the
kynge. and than ſhe kneled downe / but the kynge
toke her vp by the hāde and behelde her well
by whiche regarde / loue entred in to his herre.
Than the conſtable of Fraunce ſayd to the lor-Coucy.
Sir / by my faythe this ladye ſhall abyde
with vs / I ſe well by ye kyng / for his eyes
gothe neuer from her. So whan they had ben
with the kynge certayne ſpace / the ladyes toke
leaue of the kyng and went to their lodgynges
as yet they knewe nat the kynges intencyon.
Than the duke of Burgoyn charged the lorde
de la Ryuer to enquere of the kyng his mynde / 
who dyde ſo right dilygently / ſayeng. Sir / &
it lyke youre grace / howe lyke you this yonge
lady? Shall ſhe abyde with vs? yea truely ꝙ
the kynge / ſhe right well pleaſeth vs. Therfore
ſhew? vnto myne vncle of Burgoyne / that ſhe
maye be delyucred to vs. Whan the lorde de la
Ryuer herde hym ſaye ſo / he incontynent ſhewed
it to ye duke of Burgoyne. And he ſtreight
waye went and ſhewed it to the ladyes / wherof
they had great ioye and cryed No well. thus
the lordes and ladyes were in great ioye / & the
kynges vncles were in mynde to haue had the
maryage at Arras / but it pleaſed nat the kyng
to go ſoo farre. Therfore he deſyred his vncle / 
that it might be done ther. Well quod the duke
in a good hour be it / ſo let it be.
            THan the duke of Burgoyne / the conſtable / 
the lorde de la Ryuer / and the lorde
de la Tremoyle / and dyuers other in his company
went to the lady of Heynault / and foūde
her with her neſe by her / There he ſhewed thē
theſe tidynges / how the kyng had broken their
purpoſe / as the mariage to be had at Aras / ſayeng / 
howe the matter touched the kyng ſo nere
wherfore to morowe next we muſt heale him of
his ſickneſſe / the duches began to ſmyle. And
ſo than they departed eche fro other with great
ioye and ſolce. The ſame ſaturday at night
Fraunces Atreman and the gauntoyſe / with a
ſeuyn thouſande with hym wente out of the lā
               des
of the foure craftes / after he had fayled of
takynge of Ardenbourke. and he promyſed to
them of Gaunt at his departynge that he wolde
neuer retourne in to Gaunt / tyll he had won
ſome good towne / for the gauntoyſe dyd what
they might to putte the frenche men to ſuche buſyneſſe / 
that they ſhulde ſende no more companye
in to Scotlande to the admyrall / to make
warre agaynſt the Englyſſhmen / for ther was
a cōmon brute / that the Conſtable and dyuers
other men of arme / & certayne croſ bowes of
Gene / ſhulde entre into the ſee & go in to Scotlande
to reconforte their men that were ther allredy / 
makyng warre agaynſt Englande. Frā
               ces
Atreman who was a proper man of armes
iſſued the ſayd ſaturday out of the quarter called
the foure craftes / and all night he went coſtyng
Bruges / truſtyng to haue wonne it / but
it wolde nat be. Whan he ſawe that he fayled
there / he wente to Danne: and there his ſpyes
mette with hym / and ſayde. Sir / it were good
ye went to Danne / for ſir Roger of Guyſtelles
who is capitayne there / is nat nowe in the towne.
and true it was / he was goone to Bruges / 
wenyng that the towne of Dan had ben ſtrong
ynoughe for their defence / but he was diſceyued.

            ¶Howe Fraūces Atreman toke the
towne of Dan / and howe the french
king wedded the lady Iſabell of Bauyer:
and after went and layde ſiege
to Danne.
            
               WHan̄e Fraunces Atreman
knewe by his eſpyes / yt
ſir Roger of Guyſtels was
nat in Dan / he deuyded his
company in two / and tooke
hym ſelfe the leſſe nombre / &
ſayd. Sirs / go you yonder
wayes to ſuche a gate / and whaſie ye here me
blowe go to the barryers & backe thē downe / &
I and my cōpany ſhall bete downe the gate / for
it wyll be ouer long or we entre by ladders / the
towne ſhalbe ours I put no dout: It was done
as he ordayned & ſo wente with the leſſe nōbre.

And ſo the firſt went with ladders in to the dykes.
They founde no withſtandyng / and paſſed
the myre and dreſſed vp their ladders and
ſo entred in to the towne and came to the gate / 
ſownynge their hornes without any daunger / 
for the good men of ye towne were in their beddes
this was the .xvii. day of Iuly. thus they
came to the gate and brake the barriers / & they
without brake downe ye barriers there / ſo that
euery man entred. Than they of the towne began
to ſtyre but that was to late / for they were
taken in their houſes / & as many as were founde
in harneſſe and at defence / were ſlayne with
out mercy. Thus the good towne of Dan was
taken. wherein was founde great richeſſe / and
ſpecially the ſellers full of Malueſey and wyne
Granade. And it was ſhewed me / howe there
was great richeſſe there of thē of Bruges / whiche
they had brought thyder / for feare that they
had of rebellyon of the cōmon people.
            ERaūces Atreman / whan he ſawe that he
was lorde of Dan / he was greatly reioyſed
and ſayd. Nowe haue I well kept my promyſe
with them of Gaunte. This towne ſhall
ſerue vs well to maiſter Bruges / Sluſe / & Ardenbourcke.
Than incontynent he made a crye
that no man ſhulde be ſo hardy to touche or do
any diſpleaſure to any lady or gētylwoman in
the towne. There was the ſame tyme there / a
ſeuyn knightes wyues / who were come thyder
to ſe the lady of Guyſtelles / ſhe was redy to lye
downe a chylde beed. Thus after they had pilled
the towne and ſlayne all ſuche as wolde nat
take their parte / than they went to repayre the
towne agayne. Whanne they of Bruges herde
therof they werefore diſpleaſed / and nat without
a cauſe and armed them: And with baner
diſplayed came before the towne of Dan / and
began to ſcrimyſſhe / and to aſſayle the towne / 
but all was for nought. they loſt more than thei
wan / & ſo retourned agayne to Bruges. Whan
theſe tidynges came to Gaunt they were greatlye
reioyſed / and reputed that enterpriſe for a
noble dede / and Fraūces Atreman for a valyant
man. ¶Nowe let vs returne to the frenche
kynges weddyng.
            
               wHan the duches Margarete of Heynaulte,
who had the yonge lady in her
kepynge. Whan ſhe ſawe the day was
come ſhe apparelled the lady honeſtly / and to
them came the duches of Burgoyne and the duches
of Brabant / accompanyed with many ladyes
and damoſels. Theſe thre ladies cōueyed
the lady Iſabell of Bauiers in a chayre / rychelye
couered with a crowne on her heed / worthe
the richeſſe of a realme / whiche the kynge had
ſent her before. and the byſſhoppe of the ſame
place dyde wedde them in the preſens of all the
lordes and ladyes. After the maſſe and ſolempnyte
finyſſhed the kyng and all they went to
dyner / whiche was great and ſumptuous / and
erles and barownes ſerued the kynge in ryche
array. Thus the day cōtynued in great ſporte
tyll it was night / than the kyng went to bedde
with his newe wyfe / So the feeſt endured tyll
the wedniſday after. Than tidynges came to
the kynge and his counſayle / howe Fraunces
Atreman had wonne the towne of Danne. alſo
there came an haraude from the duke of Burbone
& brought letters to the kyng / ſignifyeng
hym howe Taylbourcke was wonne and turned
frenche / and howe the duke of Burbone &
his cōpany was goyng to ley ſiege to Vertuell
and howe they had in Poyctou / Xaynton / and
Limoſyn / recōquered ſixe fortereſſes. Theſe tidynges
ſomwhat reioyſed the court / and ſette
at nought the leſyng of Danne / ſauyng that it
was cōcluded that the kyng ſhulde do no thing
tyll he had ben in Flaunders / and won agayne
Danne / and to entre ſo farre in to the four craftes / 
out of the whiche all the venym iſſued / that
he ſhulde leaue no houſe ſtandynge / but to dyſtroy
all. Than meſſangers were ſent ouer all
the realme of Fraunce / cōmaūdynge all men of
warre to be by the firſt day of Auguſt in ye marcheſſe
of Picardy to ley ſiege to Dan. Theſe tidynges
ſpredde abrode in the realme of Fraunce / 
and euery knight and ſquyer made them redy
to come to the kyng / as they were cōmaunded.
The ſame day duke Federyke of Bauyer
and duke Aubert / and all the barony toke leue
of the kyng / and euery man retourned home to
their owne / & lefte with the kyng the lady Iſabell
of Bauyer / as than the frenche quene.
            THe frenche kyng / who had made his cō
               maundement
throughe all his realme / 
ſayd howe he wolde neuer come in Parys tyll
he had ben before the towne of Danne. And ſo
the .xxv. day of Iuly he departed fro Amyence
with the conſtable / and dyuers other lordes of
his houſe and went to Arras / where he taryed
but one night / and the next day he went to Lan
in Atthoyſe: and dayly men of warre came to
hym fro all ꝑtes / and ſo at laſt he came to Iprſo
that by ye firſte day of Auguſt he was before

Dan / and laye ſo nere to it / that the gonne ſhot
paſſed ouer his heed. A thre dayes after came
to the kynge Wylliam of Neynaulte / who was
ryght welcome to the kynge and to the duke of
Burgoyne. So there they layde a goodly ſiege
about Dan / and therin was encloſed Fraū
               ces
Atreman / who bare him ſelfe valiantly / for
euery day there was outher ſcrimyſhe or aſſaut
without it were truſe. The lorde of Clary who
was mayſter of the ordynaunce with the lorde
of Coucy / was ſtriken with a quarell out of the
towne: of whiche ſtroke he dyed / whiche was
great domage / for he was a noble knight. To
the ſiege of Danne there came men oute of the
good townes of Flaunders: as Ipre / Bruges
and out of Franke. At this ſiege were beyond
a hundred thouſande men. The kyng laye bytwene
Dan and Gaunte: and capitayne of the
Flemmynges was the lorde of ſaynt Pye and
the lorde of Guyſtels with a .xxv. ſpeares / and
laye myddes amonge them for feare of diſcencion.
         
         
            ¶Howe dyuers burgeſſes of Sluſe
were beheeded: & howe Sluſe was
chaunged for the lande of Bethune:
and howe the ſiege of Danne contynewed
longe. Cap. vii.
            
               AT an aſſault there was
made knyght by the kynge
Wylliam of Heynalte: that
day he reared vp his baner / 
and quytte hym ſelfe lyke a
good knight: But at that aſſaute
the Frenche men loſte
more than they wanne / for Fraunces Atreman
had with hym certayne archers of Englande / 
who greatly greued the aſſaylantes: Alſo he
had great plentie of artillary / for whan the towne
was wonne it was well furnyſſed: And alſo
he cauſed moche to be brought fro Gaūt / whan
he knewe that he ſhulde haue ſiege layde to the
towne. In the ſame ſeaſon whyle the ſiege laye
thus before Danne / ſome of the greatteſt of the
towne of Sluſe / ſuche as than bare mooſt rule
in the towne / were ſo wrapped with treaſon / yt
they wolde haue deliuered the towne to the kinges
enemyes / and to haue murdred their capitayne
and his company in their beddes / and to
haue ſet fyre in the kynges nauy / that lay there
at ancre / laded with prouiſyon for the kynge.
Before he wente to Danne / he was in purpoſe
to haue gone in to Scotlande after his admyrall.
And alſo theſe treators had thought to haue
broken downe the ſee bankes / therby to haue
drowned the greatteſt parte of the kyngꝭ hooſt / 
Of all this they had made marchaundiſe with
them of Gaūte / and all theſe treaſons ſhuld haue
ben done in one night: but ther was a good
man in the towne as he was in an hoſtry herde
all this treaſon / that they were purpoſed to do / 
And incontynent he went to the capitayne and
ſhewed hym the mater / and named to hym certayne
of them that had thus conſpyred the treaſon.
Whan ye capitayne herde that he ſore marueyled / 
and toke a threſcore ſpeares of his company
and wente fro houſe to houſe of the treatours / 
and ſo toke and ſette them in dyuers priſons
in ſure kepynge. Than he toke his horſe
and rode to the kyng and ſo came to his tente / 
before hym and the duke of Burgoyne: he ſhewed
all ye mater howe the towne of Sluſe was
likely to haue ben loſt / and all the kynges hoſt
likely to haue been in the water to the breſtes / 
wherof the kyng and the lordes had great marueyle.
And than the capitayne was cōmaunded
that he ſhulde retourne to Sluſe / and incontynent
to ſtryke of all their heedes withoute any
reſpyte / therby all other to take enſample. So
the capitayne retourned / and incontynent ſtrake
of all their heedes / This was the concluſion
of that buſyneſſe. Than the duke of Burgoyne
caſt in his aduyſe to fynde ſome meanes
to entreat his coſyn ſir William of Namure / to
haue of hym the towne of Sluſe by exchaunge
for other landes / and to ioyne that towne to the
countie of Flaunders. And this was moche by
thaduyſe of ſir Guy de la Tremoyle / who had
the ſormer before ſoiourned in Sluſe with a certayne
nombre of men of warre.
            
               wHan̄e ſir Wylliam of Namure herde
firſt ſpekynge of that matter / he was
marueylouſly diſpleaſed: for the towne
of Sluſe / with the apendauntes and profytes
of the ſee was a fayre and a profitable herytage / 
& it was fallen to him by his aunceſtours
wherfore he loued it the better: Howe be it the
duke of Burgoyne lay ſo ſore on hym therfore
that there was no remedy / but to make the exchaunge:
For the dukes entenſyon was to make
there a ſtronge caſtell / to ſubdue all comes

and goers by the ſee entryng in to the hauen of
Sluſe and to kepe it with mē of warre / ſo that
none ſhulde entre by the ſee in thoſe marcheſſe / 
without their daunger / and to make a towre ſo
highe to ſe troētie leages in to the ſee. So thus
breuely this ſir wylliam of Namure was ſo
ſore deſyred by the duke of Burgoyne and his
counſayle / that he was contente to exchaunge
Sluſe for the landes of Bethune / whiche is a
fayre and a great herytage in that countrey / he
to haue that to hym and to his heyres for euer:
And ſo than incontynent the duke of Burgoyn
ſette worke men a worke to make the Caſtell of
Sluſe. ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the ſiege of
Danne.
            THere was nere euery daye an aſſaute / &
dyuers ſcrimyſſhes at the gates & barriers / 
ſo that dyuers were hurt and ſlayne day
lye. The frenchmen coude nat well come to the
walles bycauſe of the dykes were full of myre / 
for if it had ben rayny wether / the hooſt ſhulde
haue had moche a do / and ſhulde haue ben fayne
to haue diſlodged wheder they wolde or nat
But by the ſpace of a moneth that the ſiege endured
it neuer rayned / and they had vitayle ynoughe:
Howe be it bycauſe of the yuell ayre &
the ſtynkynge of deed beeſtes & horſes the ayre
was ſo corrupte / that dyuers knightes & ſquyers
were therby ſore ſicke / ſo that dyuers went
to refreſſhe them at Bruges and other places / 
to forſake the yuell ayre.
            
               tHe kynge hym ſelfe went and laye at
Marles / howe be it his tentes were
ſtyll pight vp in the felde. The entent
of Fraūces Atreman was to holde ſtyll the towne / 
tyll ſocours came out of Englande to reyſe
the ſiege / and ſurely they of Gaunte had ſende
in to Englande for reſcue / and ſurely the kyng
of Englandes vncles had come ouer the ſee ſufficiently
garnyſſhed with men of warre and at
tillarye to haue reyſed the ſiege / but that they
were lette bycauſe of the admyralles beyng in
Scotlande / with acertayne nombre of men of
armes. And alſo it was ſayde in the realme of
Englande / that the conſtable of Fraūce ſhulde
come after in to Scotlande with a great puiſſan̄ce
for to make warre into Englande / wherby
the gauntoyſe were nat reſrued. Wher
fore it behoued them within the
towne of Dan to make an
yuell bargayne.

            ¶Nowe the gauntoyſe fledde out of
Dan by night / and howe the frenche
men toke the towne and diſtroyed it
And alſo howe the kynge diſtroyed
the countre of the foure craftes.
Cap. viii.
            
               THe .xxvii. day of Auguſt
the towne of Dan was won
For whan Fraunces Atreman
parceyued that he had
no ſocour / and that his artillary
began to fayle / than he
was ſom what diſconforted
in hymſelfe / and ſayd to them of his coūſayle.
Sirs / I wyll that we of Gaunt go our wayes
and lette vs ſhewe this one to another ſecretely
for if they of the towne knewe of our deꝑtyng / 
to ſaue them ſelfe / their wyues and chyldren:
Paraduenture they wyll make a ſhrewdemar
chaundyſe for vs. yea / and delyuer vs to oure
enemyes / ſo that they may be in reſt and peace / 
and that ſhulde coſte vs oure lyues / but I ſhall
kepe theym well therfro. Wherfore let vs kepe
vs all toguyder / and let vs go about the towne
to vyſite the watche / and lette vs cauſe the men
and women of the towne to go in to the mynſter / 
makynge theym to beleue that to morowe
next we ſhall haue a great aſſaute / and bicauſe
we would yt they ſhulde haue no domage / therfore
we wyll haue them in ſuretie in the churche
out of the waye. And we ſhall ſaye to the watchemen / 
that we wyll go out and make a ſcrymyſſhe
with the hooſt. And whan we be in the
feldes / lette vs ryde on the ſpurres to Gaunte.
They of his counſayle ſayd: Sir ye haue well
ſayd / ſo lette it be. And ſo euery man ordayned
them ſelfe as they had purpoſed / and in the euenyng
they truſſed redy all their goodes / ſuche
as they might cary awaye / and put all women
and children and other priſoners in to the mynſter / 
and ſpecially all ladyes and gētyl women / 
Sayeng to them: Fayre ladyes / we ſhall haue
to morowe in the mornyng a great aſſaute / 
and we wolde nat that ye ſhulde be abaſſhed / 
or take any domage. So thus they lefte them
in the churche / and at the firſt hour of the night
the gauntoiſe went and dyde viſyte the watche
and on the walles there were none but they of
the towne. Than Fraunces Atreman ſayde to
them. Sirs / make this night good watche / &
depart nat fro the walles for any thyng ye here
orſe / for in ye mornyng we ſhall haue an aſſaut / 

but yet firſt this night I wyll awake the hooſt / 
his wordes were well beleued euery man went
he had ſayd trouthe. Whan he had ordayned euery
thynge accordynge to his mynde / than he
cauſed a gate to be opyned / and ſo he & all his
company iſſued out / & he was nat halfe a leage
fro the towne but it was day light. Than they
of the towne parceyued well that Fraunces Atremen
and all his company were gone. Than
they thought them ſelfe deſceyued / than ye thefe
of the towne began to entreate with the men of
the kynges / that were there as priſoners / ſayeng
to theym / howe they had ſlayne Fraunces
Atreman the ſame night.
            
               wHan dyuers of the towne of Dan vnderſtode
howe Fraūces Atreman and
his cōpany were gone / and howe the
gate was opyn / they ran out of the towne that
beſt might: & whan this was knowen in thooſt
the bretons and burgonyons deſyring to wyn / 
mounted on their horſes and fell in the chaſe / &
purſued the gauntoiſe tyll they cāe within two
leages of Gaunte. So in the chaſe there were
many ſlayne and taken mo than fyue hundred / 
but of them were but fewe gaūtoiſe / but mooſt
of Danne / that fledde out of the towne. In the
meane ſeaſon the towne was aſſayled / where
was made no defence. So the frenche men entred
on euery ſyde by ladders / and had paſſed
the dykes with moche payne. And whan they
were within / they had wende to haue won gret
riches / but they foūde there nothyng but poore
people / men women & chyldren / and great plentie
of good wynes / and ſo for diſpyte and diſpleaſure
they ſette fyre in the towne / ſo that it
was nighe all brent / wherof the kynge and the
duke of Burgone was ſore diſpleaſed / but they
coude nat amende it: Howe be it the ladyes &
gentyl women with moche payne were ſaued
fro hurt of their bodyes or loſſe of their goods.
            AFter the takyng of Dan / the kyng was
counſayled to diſſodge and ſo the king
went and lodged a two leages fro Gaunte / at a
towne called Artulle / and whyles the kyng lay
there / his men of armes rode in the countrey of
the four craftes & diſtroyed all the countre: bycauſe
in tyme paſt / the gauntoyſehad chiefe cō
               fort
euer fro them. Therefore they brent downe
towres / churches / and houſes / and chaſed the
men women / and chyldren in to the woodes.
Whan the Frēchmen had done that diſtruction / 
than it was ordayned to go and lay ſiege to the
caſtell of Gaure and than after to Gaunte / but
all that tourned to nothyng / for tidynges came
to the kynge beyng at Artuelle fro the quene of
Hungry / by the byſſhop of Waſſelure / the ſayd
quenes ambaſſadour with dyuers knightes &
ſquyers in his company: and they brought letters
of credence / certifyeng how the ſaid quene
was comyng in to Fraunce / to fetche Lewes of
Fraunce erle of Valoys / to haue hym in to Hū
               gry
to her doughter / Whom ſir Iohan la Parſon
had wedded by procuracion in the name of
the erle of Valoyes. Theſe tidynges pleaſed
greatly the kynge and his counſayle / and ſo it
was thought that for the honoure of the yonge
Lewes erle of Valois / that they ſhulde returne
in to Fraunce / and thought they hadde done
ynoughe for that ſeaſon in the countre of Flaū
               ders.
         
         
            ¶Nowe the frenche kyng departed
out of Flaunders / and gaue leaue to

to Parys to treate with the ambaſſadours
of Hungry: & howe the Marques
of Blanquefort toke by ſtrēgth
to his wyfe the ſame lady enherytoure
of Hungry. Cap. ix.
            
               THan the frenche kyng
departed fro Artuell the. xii
day of Septembre / & gaue
leaue to all men of warre to
retourne to their owne houſes / 
of the whiche deꝑtynge
the Gauntoyſe were ryght
gladde. Than the kyng went to Craye where
the quene his wyfe was / for whan he went fro
Amyens to Flaūders / he ſent her thyder to kepe
her eſtate / and ſo he taried they certen dayes
and ſo the kyng wente to Parys and the quene
to Boyſe de Vyncens. And they the kyng & his
counſayle entended for the ordring of the yong
erle of Valoyes for he wolde that he ſhulde go
nobly in to Hūgry / where as they toke hym for
kyng. But the mater chaunged otherwyſe maſhorte
ſeaſon after in the realme of Hungry as
ye ſhall here after. It is of trouthe yt the quene
of Hūgry mother to the yonge lady / whome the
erle of Valoys had wedded by ꝓeuracion (as
ye haue herde before) had all her entēt to make

that if god be pleaſed they wolde make ſuche a
voyage / yt ſhulde be to their honour and ꝓfyte
The kyng than ſent out his cōmaundement to
aſſemble his power / and ſo at the day aſſigned
he had redy a .xxx. thouſande men all on horſe
backe / and as they came / they lodged accordynge
to the vſage of their countrey / I thynke nat
all at their eaſe.
            SIr Iohan de Vyen who had great deſyre
to ryde / and to enploye his tyme
in to Englande / to do ſome great enterpriſe / 
Whan he ſawe the ſcottes were come
he ſayd. Sirs / nowe it is tyme to ryde / we haue
lyen to long ſtyll: ſo than the ſettyng for warde
was publyſſhed to euery man / thā they toke
their waye to Roſebourcke. In this iourney
the kyng was nat / he abode ſtyll at Edēborow
but all his ſonnes were in the army. The thou
ſande complete harneſſe that the Frenche men
brought with thē / was delyuered to the knightes
of Scotlande and of Norwiche / who were
before but yuell harneſſed / of the whiche harneſſe
they had great ioye / And ſo they rode towarde
Northumberlande: And ſo longe they
rode that they came to the abbey of Mauues / &
there they lodged all about the ryuer of Tymbre / 
and the nexte day they cāe to Morlane and
than before Roſeboucke. The kepar of Roſeboure
vnder the lorde Mōtagu / was a knight
called ſir Edwarde Clyfforde. The admyrall
of Fraunce and the ſcottes taryed and behelde
well the caſtell / and all thynges conſidred / they
ſawe well to aſſayle it ſhulde lytell aucyle them
for the caſtell was ſtronge and well furnyſſhed
with artillary. And ſo than they paſſed by and
drewe a long the ryuer ſyde aprochyng to Berwyke.
And ſo long they rode that they came to
two towres right ſtrong / whiche were kept by
two knightes / the Father and the ſonne / bothe
were called ſir Iohan Strande. Aboute theſe
towres were fayre landes and a fayre place / the
whiche incontynent were brent / & the two towres
aſſayled. Ther was many feates of armes
ſhewed: and dyuers ſcottes hurte with ſhotte
and caſt of ſtones / Finally the towres
were wonne / and the knightes
within by playne aſſaut / 
yet they defended
thē as longe
as they
might endure.

Cap. xi.
            
               AFter the conqueſt of thes
two towres / than they went
to another caſtel called Varley / 
parteyning to the herytage
of ſir Iohn Montagu
and Capitayne there vnder
hym was ſir Iohan of Luſſenborne / 
who had there with hym his wyfe &
his chyldren / and all his good. He knewe well
before that the ſcottes wolde come thyder / therfore
he had purneyed the caſtel to the beſt of his
power to abyde the aſſaute. So about this caſtell
taryed all the armye. This caſtell ſtode in
a fayre countre / by a fayre ryuer whiche cometh
out of Tymbre / and ronneth in to the ſee. So
on a day there was a great aſſaut / and the frenche
men bare thē well the ſame day / moche better
than the ſcottes dyd / for they entred in to the
dykes / and paſſed through with moche payne / 
There was many feates of armes done / what
by them aboue and them beneth: The frenche
men moūted vp by ladders and fought hande
to hande with daggars on the walles. Sir Iohan
Luſſēborne dyd quyte hym ſelfe lyke a valyant
knight / and fought with the frenche men
hande to hande on the ladders. At this aſſaute
there was ſlayne a knight of Almaygne called
ſir Bleres Gaſtelayne / whiche was great domage.
There were many hurt that day / but finally
there was ſo moche people and thaſſaute
ſo well contynued / that the caſtell was wonne / 
and the knight / his wyfe and chyldren taken / &
a .xl. other priſoners. And than the caſtell was
brent and raſed downe / for they ſawe well that
it was nat to be kept / ſeyng that it was ſo farr
in Englande as it was. Than the admyrall &
ſcottes rode towarde Auwike in ye lande of the
lorde Percy / & lodged there about / & brent certayne
villages: and ſo came to another caſtell
of therle of Northūberlandes / ſtandyng on the
ſee ſyde / but they aſſayled it nat / for they knew
well they ſhulde leſe their payne. And ſo they
rode all about that fronter / halfwaye bytwene

Berwyke & Newcaſtell on the ryuer of Tyne / 
and there they vnderſtode / howe yt the duke of
Lācaſtre / therle of Northūberlande / the erle of
Notingham / the lorde Neuell / and the barons
of thoſe marches of Northūberlande / & of the
byſſhoprikes of yorke & Dyrham / were comynge
on them with a great power. Whan thadmyrall
of Fraunce knewe therof he was right ioy
full / and ſo were all the barons of Fraūce that
were in his cōpany / for they deſyred to haue batayle / 
but the ſcottes cared Iytell therfore. there
they were counſayled to returne againe towarde
Berwyke / bycauſe of their prouiſyon that
folowed them: & alſo to be nere their owne coū
               tre / 
and there to abyde for their ennemyes. So
thadmyrall beleued thē / and returned towarde
Berwyke / wherof ſir Thomas Redman was
capitayne / & with hym right good men of armes.
So the french men and ſcottes lay before
the towne / but aſſayled it nat / & ſo paſſed by the
next day and toke the waye to Burbourcke / to
retourne to their owne countrees.
            Tidynges was brought anon in to Englāde
howe the frēchmen & ſcottes were in Northum

kynge of Englande knewe rightwell before of
their comynge / wherfore ye lordes were redy in

Thenglyſſhmen had made that ſomer the gretteſt
prouiſyon / that euer they made to go in to
Scotlande bothe by lande & water. They had
a .xxvi. veſſels on the fee charged with ꝓuiſion
coſtyng the frōters of Englande / redy to entre

cāe him ſelfe acōpanyed with his vncles / therle

purſuyng the ſcottes / were a two .M. ſpeares
& .xv. M. archers / And the kynge & the lordes
were fyftie .M. archers beſyde varlettes.
            The kyng folowed the duke of Lancaſtre ſo
faſt / that he and all his hoſt came in to the marches
about yorke: for on the way tidynges cāe
to the kyng / howe that his people that were before / 
were likely to fight with the ſcottes in the

And ther tidynges came to the kyng / how that

The wordes ſo multiplyed / that the two
archers toke parte with the ſtraunger / and blamed
the two ſquyers / ſayng: Sirs / yedo wrō
               ge
to medyll with this knight / for ye knowe he
is belongyng to the quene / and of her countre.
ye ought rather to ſupport him than otherwiſe
Than one of the ſquyers ſayd: What enuyous
knaue? Haſt thou to do thoughe I blame hym
for his folly. What haue I to do quod the archer?
I haue right well to do therwith / for he is
companyon to my mayſter / Therfore I wyll
nat be in the place / to ſuffre hym to receyue any
villany. yea quod the ſquyer / if I thought
thou woldeſt ayde hym agaynſte me / I wolde
put this ſwerd through thy body / & made coūtnaūce / 

as thoughe he wolde haue ſtryken him.
The archer ſtepped backe with his bowe / whiche
was redy bente: And ſette an arowe therin
and drewe it vp / and ſhotte agaynſt the ſquyer
that the arowe pearſed thoroughe body & hart / 
and ſo fell downe deed. Whan the other ſquyer
ſawe his felowe deed he fledde awaye / and ſir
Myles retourned to his lodgynge. The two
archers went to their maiſter and ſhewed hym

ſayde / Thou haſt done right yuell. Sir quod
the archer / I coude do none otherwiſe without
I wolde haue been ſlayne my ſelfe / and I had

that thou be nat founde / and I ſhall entreate for

and it was ſhewed hym the maner howe: And
that it was for the cauſe of ſir Myles the ſtraū

Whan ſir Iohan of Holande was well enfourmed
of this aduenture / he was ryght ſore
diſpleaſed and ſayd. I ſhall neuer eate nor drike
tyll it be reuenged. Than he lepte on his horſe
and toke certayne of his men with hym / and
departed fro his owne lodgynge. It was as
than right late and ſo rode in to the feldes / and
enquered / Where ſir Myles was lodged. It
was ſhewed hym / he was lodged in the reregarde
with the erle of Deuurynters and therle

wente ſtreyght to ſaynt Iohans of Beuerley /

men toguyder aſſembled / as be nowe / 
And ye wyll / we ſhall bringe you in to ſuche a
place / that ye ſhall well ſe and aduyſe theym.
And thanne if ye counſayle that they ſhall be
fought with all / it ſhall nat be refuſed by vs.
For ſurely ſir / all ſuche wordes as ye haue ſaid
we dyde ſpeke them. A goddes name quod the
admyrall / let me ones ſe thē. And ſo anon after
therle Dugles and other barons of Scotlāde
brought thadmyrall vnto a highe mountayne / 
and vnder the hyll there was a paſſage / wherby
thēglyſſhe hoſt muſt paſſe: on this hyll was
thadmyrall / wt diuers knightꝭ of Fraūce in his

company / And there clerely they ſawe the Englyſſhe
men and all their puiſſaunce / and ther
they nombred them as nere as they coude to be
a ſire thouſande men of armes / & threſcore thouſande
archers and other. Than all thynges cō
               ſydred
they ſayd howe they were nat of puyſſaunce
ſuffycient to fight with the Englyſſhemen / 
for they paſſed nat a thouſande ſpeares &
a .xxx. thouſande of all other men / and but yuell
armed. Than the admyrall ſayd to the etle Duglas
and to therle Morette. Sirs / ye ſaye but
good reaſon / thoughe ye haue no wyll to fight
with the Engliſſhe men. Therfore aduyſe you
what ye wyll do / they are ſtronge ynoughe to
ouer ryde all your countrey / and to diſtroy it.
And ſithe ye maye nat fight with them / I pray
you bring me throughe your countre / by ſome
priuye waye in to Englande if it maye be: and
we ſhall make them warre in ſome other parte
as they do to vs here. Sir ꝙ the barones / that
ſhall we well do / for we knowe dyuers wayes.
            
               TO thus the admyrall and the barones
of Scotlande determyned to forſake
Scotlande / and to lette the Englyſſh
men alone / and to go & entre into Wales / and
to go to the cytie of Carlyle and there to reuenge
them. So they lefte the Englyſſhe men and
toke the foreſtes and mountayns / and as they
rode throughe out Scotlande / they diſtroyed
all as they wente and brent townes / vyllages / 
and maners: and cauſed all the men / women / &
chyldren of the coūtre to driue all their catayle / 
and to go into yt wylde foreſtes / for they knewe
well the Engliſſhe men wolde nat folowe them
thyder. And the kynge of Scottes wente in to
the wylde ſcottyſſhe / bicauſe he wes nat ī good
poynt to ryde a warfare / and they he taryed all
the warre durynge / and lette his men alone.
So the Frenche men and Scottes paſſed the
highe mountayns / bytwene. Northumberlāde
and Scotlande / and entred in to the lande of
Wales / and began to brenne villages / and dyd
moche hurte in the Mombrayes landes. And

and the lordes of Scotlande rode in Northū
               berlande
bytwene the mountayns on the fronters
of Wales / brennyng townes / maners / and
countrees: And the kyng of Englande and his
vncles / with barons and knightes of Englāde
and their companyes entred in to Scotlande / 
and brent and exyled on their parte. And ſo the
kyng came and lodged in Edenborowe / ye chefe
towne in all Scotlande / and there taryed fyue
dayes / and at his departyng it was ſet a fyre &
brent vp clene / but the caſtell had no hurt / for it
was ſtronge ynough and well kept. Whyle the
kyng lay at Edenborowe / thenglyſſhmen rode
abrode in the countre and dyd moche / hurt / but
they foūde nother man nor beeſt abrode / for all
was withdrawen in to the foreſtes. In the Englyſſhe
hooſt were mo than a hūdred thouſāde
men / and well as many horſe / wherof they had
nede of great prouiſyon / and they foūde none
in Scotlande / but out of Englande there cāe
to thē great plentie / bothe by lande and by ſee.
Than the kyng departed fro Edēborowe and
rode towarde Eſtruleyn a good towne / wherin
there was a great abbey of blacke monkes / 
and mooſt cōmenly the kynges of Scotlande
are there buryed. The kyng lay in the abbey &
at their deꝑtyng / abbey & all was brent. Than
they paſſed the ryuer of Taxe / whiche ronneth
to ſaint Iohn̄s towne / at the caſtell of Strulyn
there was a great aſſaute / but it wolde nat be
wonne: yet the towne and all the landes of the
lorde Vercy they brent.
            THe entent of the duke of Lancaſtre and
of his bretherne / was to paſſe through
Scotlande and to purſue the ſcottes and frenche
men / for, they knew well they were gone the

waye to Wales to go to Carlyle: And ſo they
thought to encloſe thē bytwene Englande and
Scotlande / and to fight with them at their aduauntage.
This purpoſe they thought veryly
to holde. Thenglyſſhe men ſpredde abrode in
Scotlāde / there was no reſyſtence agaynſt thē
for the countre was voyde of all men of warre:
they were gone in to Englande with the admyrall
of Fraunce. And ſo there the Englyſſhmen
brent the towne of ſaynt Iohn̄s / where as the
ryuer of Taxe rynneth / and there is a good hauen
to ſayle thens ouer all the worlde / and after
they brent the towne of Donde. The Englyſſh
men ſpared nother abbeys nor minſters but ſet
all on fyre. And ſo they of the vowarde ran to
Bredan / whiche is a cytie on the ſee ſyde / It is
on thentre of the wylde ſcottyſſhe / but they dyd
no hurte therto / howe be it they of the countrey
were right ſore afrayed. They of that cytie thought
to haue aſſaute / for they feared leeſt ye kynge
of Englande wolde haue come thyder / and
haue ouer ron all that countre.
            THus in lykewiſe as the Englyſſhemen
dyde in Scotlande / ſo dyd the frenche
men and ſcottes in Englande / in the marcheſſe
of Northumberlande and Wales. & they brent
a great countre as they went out of Northumberlande
and entred in to Wales / whiche was
otherwiſe called Wynſlande / and paſſed by the
landes of the lordes of Grayſtocke and Clyfforde / 
and brent in their voyage dyuers great
villages / for they were no men of warre in that
coūtre as than / for they were all with the kyng.
So they came to the cyte of Catlyle in Wales / 
whiche was well cloſed with gatꝭ / walles / & dykes:
It was a place that of auncyent tyme kynge
Arthure loued rightwell / bycauſe that there
were great woodes / and many dedes of armes
there was done. There laye in Carlyle in gariſon
ſir Lewes Clyfforde / brother to ſir Wyllm̄
Neuell / and with hym ſir Thom̄s Moſgraue
and Dauy Holgraue his ſonne / and ſir Dongorſſe / 
and dyuers other of the marcheſſe and
fronters of Wales / for the cytte of Carlyle was
chiefe cytie of all that countre / and it was nede
full for good men of warre to be the
                  •
               : for whan
the admyrall of Fraunce came thyder he aſſayled
the cytie by great force / the whiche aſſaute
was cruell and fierſe. So thus before
the cytie there were many noble
dedes of armes
done.

and the mooſt parte of the cōmons of

on a night the erle of Oxenforde / who was as
than chiefe of counſayle with the kynge & bare

He turned the kyng cleue fro his purpoſe I can

What thynke ye to do? Wyll ye folowe the way

Sir / putte nat youre ſelfe in to that daunger /

            THe next mornyng the lordes of Englande
and their people / ordred them ſelfe to
deꝑte out of Scotlāde / and to folowe their ennemyes

For if ye wyll make this voyage / do it and ye

into Englande the nexte waye / and all
ſuche as loue vs wyll folowe vs. Than the duke
of Lancaſtre ſayd: Sir / I ſhall folowe you
for ye haue neuer a man in your company / that

And if there be any man wyll ſaye (except your

wolde ſpeke any worde: And the kynge helde

and the duke of Lācaſtre departed fro the kynge
right ſore troubled in his mynde / and returned
to his cōpany / and made newe ordynaūce / 
for in the morning they had thought to haue folowed
the frenchmen in to the marches of Wales / 
but they dyde nat ſo for they retourned the
next waye in to Englande. Lo / thus ye may ſe
howe thetle of Oxēforde who was great with
the kyng brake all this voyage / and dyuers of

was come / For they ſayd they might well haue
folowed the ſcottes in to Wales / For in their ſo

of payne and trauell ſaid / howe that all thynges
cōſidred / they were better to retourne than
to go any further: Sayeng / howe a great ꝓuiſion
muſt be had to ſcrue ſuche an hoſt / & howe
it was yuell to paſſe the mountayns that wynter
ſeaſon / wherby they ſayd they might rather
leſe than wynne.
            THus in his ſeaſon brake vp the iorney
and army of Englande: and the kynge
and his lordes retourned in to Englande / the
ſame way they came / but they hadde diſtroyed
the mooſt parte of the realme of Scotlande.
Theſe tidynges came to the admyrall of Fraū
               ce
and to the ſcottes / than they tooke counſayle
what was beſt for them to do / and ſo concluded
to retourne agayne in to Scotlande / for their
vitails began to fayle and they were in a poore
countrey / for they had diſtroyed the marches of
Carlyle / and the landes of the barone of Clyfforde / 
the lorde Maubray / and the byſſhoprike
of Carlyle / but the cytie they coude nat wynne.
And the frenche men ſayd / howe they had brent
and diſtroyed in the byſſhorike of Dyrhame &
Carlyle / that was better worthe than all ye townes
in Scotlande. So the frenchmen and ſcottes
retourned in to Scotlande the ſame waye
they came: And whan they came into Scotlā
               de
they founde the countrey diſtroyed / but the
people of the countre dyde ſette but lytell therby
and ſaid / howe with thre or four poles / ſhortely
they wolde make agayne their houſes / for
they had ſaued moche of their catayle in the foreſtes:
But all that the frenche men tooke they
were fayne to paye truely therfore / and dere.
The frenche men were often in great daunger / 
for the ſcottes and they were at many debates
for vitayle: And the ſcotes ſayd / howe the frenche
men dyde them more demage than the Englyſſhe
men had done: & when it was demaunded
of them why ſo they anſwered and ſayde:
howe the frenche men as they rode abrode they
beate downe & deſoyled their cornes / as whete
barley / and otes: and wolde nat kepe the highe
wayes / but rather ryde throughe the corne. Of
whiche demages / they ſaid they wolde haue of
them a trewe recōpence or they departed out of
Scotlande: & ſayde / Howe they ſhulde nother
haue ſhyppe nor maryner to paſſe thē ouer the
ſee / without their leaue and lycēce. and dyuers
other knightes and ſquyers complayned / that
their woodes were cutte downe by the frenche

there tyll ſomer they ſhulde be deed for pouertie.
And if they ſhulde departe a ſonder and
ſerche for their lyueng abrode ī the coūtre / they
douted that the ſcottes wolde ſlee them in their
beddes. The admyrall conſydred well all theſe
thynges: and ſawe clerely how it was likely to
be as they ſayde / howe be it he was in purpoſe
to abyde there all the wynter / & to ſende to the
frenche kyng and to the duke of Burgoyne / certifyeng
them what caſe they were in / and to haue
newe prouiſyon of money and vitayls / and
to make a newe freſſhe warre agayne the nexte
ſomer to in Englande / howe be it he ſawe well
the yuels of the ſcottes / and conſydred the yell
of his people. Than he gaue leaue to departe / 
all ſuche as wolde / but at their departyng was
the miſchefe / for the lordes coude fynde no paſſage
for thēſelfe nor for their men. The ſcottes
wolde that ſuch knightes and ſquyers as were
but poore ſhulde departe / to thentent that they
might rule the remnant at more eaſe: and ſayd
to the admyrall. Sir / lette youre men departe
whan they wyll / but as for youre ſelfe / ye ſhall
nat departe out of this coūtre / tyll we be full ſatiſfied
of all ſuche charges as we haue borne all

            THeſe tidynges were right harde to the

and ſhewed all the mater to the erle Duglas
and to the erle Morette / who beſemynge were

erles & barons of Scotlande / who ſaid / howe

Than theſe two erles ſayd to the admyrall and

nat rule the other lordes nor the cōmons / Wherfore
it behoued them if they purpoſed to go out

ſawe that it wolde be non otherwiſe / he
thought he wolde nat leſe the more for the leſſe.
He conſydred well / howe he was without conforte

The frenche kyng & his counſayle were boūde
to redeme agayne the admyrall / for they ſende
hym thyder. Than̄e the ſōmes of money were
ordayned for / and the money payed by exchāge

Some knightes and ſquyers of his company
returned nat agayne with hym / they thought

went in to dyuers partes. The mooſt parte retourned
in to Fraunce ſo poore / that they were

laſte ſayd. It is a great thyng of threſcore thouſande
archers & of ſixe or ſeuyn thouſande men
of armes. It maye well be quod the Conſtable
that they may make that nombre / but yet I had
rather fight with theym at home in their owne
marches than with halfe the nombre here / and
ſo I herde my maiſter ſaye often tymes whan
I was yonge. By my faithe quod the admyrall / 
if ye had ben there with a great nombre of
men of armes as I ſuppoſed ye ſhulde haue bē
I thynke we hadde famyſſhed all Scotlande.
Thus the conſtable and admyrall deuyſed toguyder / 
and they ſette the duke of Burgoyne
in great deſyre to make an armye in to Englā

¶Nowe let vs leaue a lytell to ſpeke of thē

               IT is of trouthe / the duke of Burgoyn
had ymagined in his mynde to make
the nexte Somer folowynge / whiche
ſhulde be in the yere of oure lorde god / a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and fyue / a great
army / and to moue the frenche kyng as moche
as he might to go into Englande. And alſo the
conſtable of Frāce / who was an expert knight
and well beloued in the realme of Fraūce / and
had ben brought vp in his youthe in the realm
of Englande: He in lykewiſe gaue counſayle
to the ſame enterpriſe / and ſo dyde the lorde dela

                  •
               emoyle. And bycauſe yt the duke of Berrey
was in Poictou and Lymoſyn / and knewe

nothynge of this counſayle / the duke of Burgoyne
who was chiefe about the kynge / he had
dyuers ymaginacions. he thought well that as
long as the warre contynued in Flaūders / the
voyage ouer the ſee in to Englande / coude nat
well be done: Wherfore he was more troubled
with them of Gaunte / and enclyned rather to
their deſyres. for he knewe well how they were
alyed to thenglyſſhe men. And howe they had
in Gaunte a knight of Englande called ſir Iohan
Bourchier / ſent thyder by kyng Richarde
to gouerne the towne and to counſayle theym:
Howe be it the gauntoyſe deſyred to haue peace
for they were ſo ouerlayd by the warre / that
the mooſt ryche and notableſt perſones of the
towne / were nat maiſters of their owne goodꝭ
for the wylde ſoudyours gouerned them. And
the wyſe men ſawe well / that at length it coude
nat endure / but that they were all in great parell.
And whan they were toguyder / dyuers of
ten tymes marueyled / howe they had endured
ſo longe as they hadde done: they ſawe well it
was rather by force than by loue / For Peter de
Boyſe alwayes parceyuered in his yuell opynions
and domages / So that non durſt ſpeke
before hym of peace / for if he knewe any ꝑſone
though he were neuer ſo ſage that ſpake of any
treatie of peace / incōtynent he was ſlayne and
murthered without pytie or remedy.
            THis warre that they of Gaunte hadde
maynteyned agaynſt their lorde therle
Loyes of Flaunders and the Duke of Bourgoyne
had / endured a ſeuyn yere / wherby ther
was ſuche hurte done / that it were great marueyle
to reherſe. The turkes / paynims / and ſaraſyns
ſorowed that warre: For of trouthe the
marchaundyſes of eightene realmes / arryued
lightely at Sluſe / and had their delyueraunce
at Danne or at Bruges / whiche was all let by
this warre. Than beholde and cōſydre if theſe
farre ꝑties ſorowed this warre: Moche more
ought to be ſorie the landes nexte adioynynge
therto / & there was none coude fynde any meane
of peace. And ſo firſte by the grace of god &
diuyne inſpyracion / and by the hūble prayers
of good folkes / that god opened their eares / &
had pytie of the poore people of Flaunders.
And how the peace came by them I ſhall ſhewe
you fro poynt to poynt / as I ſhewed you before
the begynning / ſo ſhall I declare the endynge.
The begynnyng of the hatte was by Iohn̄ de
Bare / Iohan Piet / Gylbert Mathue / Iohan
Lion and ſuche other / and I deſyre you to herken
thervnto.
         
         
            ¶How by the grace of god two burgeſſes
of Gaunt enteredde to treate

And howe they gaue the charge
therof to a knight of Flaunders / and
what aunſwere the duke gaue vnto
them. Cap. xviii.
            
               IN this ſeaſon in the towne
of Gaunt was ſir Iohan
Bourchyer ruler there vnder
the kynge of Englande / 
and Peter de Boyſe dyd aſſyſt
hym and ſuſteygned all
their yuell opinyons. Ther
were ſome wyſemen right ſore diſpleaſed with
the dyſcēcion bytwene their naturall lorde and
the towne: how be it they durſt nat ſhewe forth
the ententes of their hartes / but one of them to
another as they durſt ſecretely. For if Peter de
Boyſe had knowen that they had made any 
                  ••
               
               blant

Dartuell had ſlayne ſir Symon Bec
                  •
               e and ſir
Gylbert Brute / and to kepe the people of Gaūt
in feare: He had cauſed dyuers to be ſlayne in
that ſeaſon. In that ſeaſon afore or Fraunces
Atremau was putte oute of the towne of Dan
by the frenche kyng / and had diſtroyed the coū
               trey
of the foure mayſters / and that the kynge
was returned agayne in to Fraunce (as ye haue
herde before) They of Gaūt began to dout
and the notable men of the towne ſuppoſed / yt
the nexte Somer the frenche kynge wolde retourne
agayne and beſiege the towne / but Peter
de Boyſe and ſuche other of his ſecte made
but lyght therof: Sayenge / howe they wolde
gladly ſe the kynge before their towne / for they
ſayd / they had ſuche alyaunce with the kyng of
Englāde / that they ſhulde ſoone be ayded and
conforted. In this ſeaſon there was in the towne
two valyant men of good lyfe and of good
conuerſacyon / of a meane lygnage / nat of the
beſt nor of the worſt. Whiche ꝑſones were ſore
diſpleaſed to ſe the diſcorde bytwene the towne
and their naturall lorde / howe be it they durſte

nat ſpeke therof for feare of Peter de Boyſe / 
One of them was a maryner & the other a bocher / 
the one called Roger de Creuyn / and the
other Iaques Dardenbourke.

               I theſe two perſones the matter was

knight of Flaunders called ſir Iohan
Delle / who tooke great payne therin: But he
nor all the knyghtes in Flaūders coude neuer
haue brought it to paſſe / and it had nat ben by
the meanes of theſe two perſons. This knight
ſir Iohan Delle was welbeloued in the towne
of Gaunt / and came and wente at his pleaſure
without any ſuſpection. Theſe two forſayd ꝑſons
had great diſpleaſure of this debate
                  •
                and
ſpake priuely togyder therof: And Roger ſaid
to Iaques. Wyll there be no remedy foūde bytwene
the towne of Gaunte (in the whiche we
were borne / and is nowe in a harde caſe) & the
duke of Burgoyn our naturall lorde? It were
a great almes dede to make a peace
                  •
                & they that
ſo coude do / ſhulde haue thanke of god & great
prayſe of the worlde: for by that meanes ye trouble
ſhulde be ceaſed for euer, ye ſaye trouthe ꝙ
Iaques: But it is a harde thynge to bringe about:
for Peter de Boyſe is a paryllous man / 
there is none dare ſpeke of peace for feare of hī.
Well ꝙ Roger / yet it can nat be alwayes thus / 
at laſt it muſt nedes haue an ende. Shewe me
quod Iaques by what meanes it myght be / &
I wyll gladly here you. Than quod Roger / ye
be the chefe of all the bochery / and mooſt beloued
and dradde. ye might ſecretely ſhewe your
corage and entent to them that be your frēdes / 
and as ye ſe howe they enclyne / ye maye ſpeke
further lytell and lytell. And on the other ſyde / 
I that am a maryner and beloued with all maner
of men. and I knowe ſome of their coragꝭ
howe that the warre diſpleaſeth them / for they
haue great domage therby. And I ſhall ſhewe
my mynde to ſome / who ſhall drawe other to ye
ſame purpoſe. And if we maye gette theſe two
craftes of our accorde / the other craftes & other
good people ſuche as deſyreth peace / wyllnſone
euclyne to vs. Well quod Iaques / and I ſhall
ſpeke gladly to thē of my crafte / and ſpeke you
to yours. And as they deuyſed ſo it was done / 
ryght ſecretely and wiſely / ſo that by the grace
of the Holygoſt / Iaques Dardenboure foūde
all tho of the bochery well enclyned to his wyll
And Roger on his part by meanes of his fayre
language / founde the maryners ryght well agreed
therto / for their crafte was nere loſte for
lacke of vſage.
            
               Hus theſe two wyſe men ſhewed eche
to other / howe they founde their people
diſpoſed to haue peace. Than they
ſaid / howe they muſt haue ſome other ſage perſone
to ſhewe all this matter to their lorde. At
laſt they remembred them of a knight called ſir
Iohan Dell / and ſo they went to hym and diſcouered
to hym all their ententes ſecretly / and
ſayd. Sir / we haue laboured ſo moche to thē
of our craftes / that they be well enclyned to haue
peace / ſo that our lorde the duke of burgoyn
wolde pardon them / and to graunt vs our aū
               cyent
frauncheſſes / according to the tenours of
our charters and bulles. Than this ſir Iohan
ſayd / I ſhall gladly go and entreate hym. And
ſo this knight went out of the towne to ye duke / 
who was in Fraūce with the kyng / and he ſhewed
hym all the forſaid mater / & dyd ſo moche
with his fayre langage / that the duke enclyned
to here what he wolde ſaye: And for the deſyre
that the duke had to make a voyage in to Englande / 
the lightlyer he condiſcended to haue
peace with them of Gaunt: And alſo his counſayle
ſir Guy de la Tremoyle and ſir Iohan
de Vyen / and the conſtable and the lorde Coucy / 
counſayled him to take peace with thē: than
the duke anſwered and ſayd to ſir Iohn̄ Delle
I am content to do in this mater as ye wyll deuyſe / 
and ſo retourne ye agayne to thē that ſent
you hyder: And the duke demaunded of hym / 
if Fraunces Atreman were a counſayle of this
treatie or nat. Sir quod he / I thynke he knoweth
nothynge therof / he kepeth the Caſtell of
Gaure / and I knowe nat if they that ſent me hider / 
wolde that he ſhulde knowe it or nat. Tell
thē quod the duke that they ſpeke hardely with
him in the mater / for I thynke he wyll nat be agaynſt
me / for as I vnderſtāde he deſireth gretly
to be at peace wt me. as the duke cōmaunded
ſo this knyght dyd / and retourned to Gaunt &
brought theſe good tidyngꝭ. And than he went
to the caſtell of Gaure to ſpeke with Fraunces
Atreman / and diſcouered all his entent ſecretely
to him. And whan Fraunces had a lytell ſtudyed
/ merely he ſaid. And if my lorde the duke
wyll pardon them of Gaunt and vpholde their
frauncheſes / I ſhall nat be rebell agaynſt hym
but be right diligent to haue peace. Than this
knight departed fro hym and went agayne in
to Fraunce to the duke / and ſhewed hym all the

mater. The duke herde hym gladly / and wrot
letters open & cloſe ſealed with his ſeale / to thē
of Gaūte. And this knyght with thoſe letters
retourned in to Flaunders / & ſo came to Gaūt / 
but he ſhewed nat the letters as than / but he ꝓmyſed
Roger and Iaques to accōplyſſhe their
ententes. Beholde nowe what ꝑell this knight
and they were in: For if ſir Iohan Bourchier

aſſembled their frendes to accomplyſſhe

Iohan Delle for the dukes letters of
peace. Cap. xix.
            
               THan̄e Roger and Iaques

Sir / ye ſhall come on monday
nexte comyng in to this
towne at nyne of the clocke / 
and bringe with you the dukes
letters / and ſhewe them
openly to the cōmons of Gaunte / wherby they
ſhall gyue the more credence / for by that houre / 
we wyll be lordes of the towne / or elles ſlayne
in the quarell. Well quod ſir Iohan / be it as ye
ſaye: and ſo ended their coūſayle for that tyme
And ſir Iohan Delle went out of the towne to
accomplyſſhe his purpoſe. Theſe other two
wyſemen ſtudyed howe to bringe aboute their
purpoſe / and ſo ſpake with ſome of their frendes
and aldermen of the craftes / ſo that they
had a great nombre of their accorde: And determyned
that on the nexte monday at nyne of
the clocke / they ſhulde departe out of their houſes / 
with the banner of Flaūders before them:
Cryeng the Lyon of Flaūders / the lorde of the
countrey / hath gyuen peace to the good towne
of Gaunte / and hath pardoned clerely all treſpaſſes.
For all this mater was ſagely hādeled
yet it came to the knowlege of Peter de Boiſe.
And as ſoone as he knewe therof / he went ſtreight
to ſir Iohan Bourchyer / who was ſoueraygne
capitayne there vnder the kyng of Englande / 
and ſayd to hym: Roger Creuyn and
Iaques Dardēbourke / wyll be to morowe by
nyne of the clocke in the market place / with the
banner of Flaunders before theym: And they
wyll crye through the towne / the Lyon of Flaū
               ders
lorde of this countre / hath gyuen peace to
the towne of Gaunte / and hath ꝑdoned all treſpaſſes.
What ſhall we do? The kynge of Englande
ſhall nat be than̄e obeyed / without we
preuent them / and putte them out of our iuryſdyctions.
What is beſt than to do quod ſir Iohan
Bourchier? Than aunſwered Peter and
ſayd. It behoueth / that to morowe in the mornyng / 
we aſſemble in harnes all our men in the
houſe de la Vale: And than let vs go throughe
the towne with the kynge of Englandes baner
before vs / and lette vs crye alſo: The Lyon of
Flaunders kynge of Englande / lorde of this
countrey and towne of Gaunte. And whan we
come in to the market place / ſuche as be on our

all the other treatours. It is well deuyſed ꝙ
ſir Iohan Bourchier / lette it ſo be done.
            ¶Nowe beholde / if god dyde nat moche for
theſe two / Roger and Iaques: For they were
enfourmed of Peter de Boyſe deuyſe. & whan
they knewe it they were nat abaſſhed: But late
in the euenynge they ſente to all their frendes / 
that where as they ſhulde be the nexte daye in
the market place by eight of the cloke / in any
wyſe they deſyred them to be there by ſeuyn of
the clocke / and that they dyde to preuent Peter
de Boyſe. To this poyntment euery man was
agreed / and on the monday in the mornyng ſir
Iohan Bourchyer and his company came to
the houſe called de la Vale / & with hym a threſcore / 
and Peter de Boyſe came thyder with a
xl. there they armed thē / & in good ordynaunce
ſette them ſelfe forwarde. And Roger and Iaques
aſſembled their frendes togyder / and the
mooſt parte of the aldermen and burgeſſes of
Gaunt came to them. Than they toke the erles
baner and went through the towne / cryeng the
foreſaid crye / and ſuche as herde the crye / and
ſawe the aldermen of their craftes and the baners
of the erle / they folowed after and came to
the ſame cōpany: And ſo by ſeuyn of the clocke
they came to the market place / and there ſet thē
ſelfe in good order / with therles baners before
them / and euer there came mo and mo to them.
Theſe tidynges came anone to ſir Iohn Bourchier

and to Peter de Boyſe / who were aſſemblynge
of their people. Than they went forthe
with the baners of Englāde before them / and
as they wente / they cryed their cryes before deuyſed.
And ſo they came to the ſaid market place / 
and there araynged them ſelfe before the other / 
but euer ſuche as came / the mooſt parte
went to the Erles baners / ſo that if a hundred
came fourſcore went thyder: In ſo moche / that
all the place was full of men of armes / and ſo

            WHan Peter de Boyſe / ſawe howe the
aldermen of the craftes drewe to Roger
and Iaques he was ſore abaſſhed
and douted greatly of his lyfe: For he ſawe ſuche
as were wont to ſerue hym / flye awaye fro

And whan Roger and Iaques ſawe yt / nighe
all the people drewe to their parte / they were
right ioyouſe and well cōforted / and nat without
good cauſe: For than they ſawe well / that
the people of Gaunt wolde be in peace wt their

their company / with the baners of Flaunders
before them / and ſo came to ſir Iohan Bourchyer
and to the Englyſſhemen / who were nat

and ſaid. I thynke Peter de Boyſe be here

                  AFter the makyng of theſe preſent
letters and charters of peace / and
engroſed and Sealed they were
publyſſhed / and the duke had the
one parte of them / and the towne
of Gaunt the other parte. Than Fraūces Atreman
& the cōmons of the towne of Gaūt beyng

of the ducheſſe / and alſo of the lady of Brabāt / 
Thankyng her a thouſande tymes of her ayde

exhorted them euer to kepe fermely the peace / 
and ſo to ſtyrre ye people / that they neuer rebell
agaynſt their lorde and lady: So than euery
body departed and went home to their owne.
The duke and duches retourned to Lyle / and
they of Gaunt returned to their towne. Whan
Peter de Boiſe ſawe the ſure confyrmacion of
the peace / and that all the people of Gaunt had
great ioye therof / and were in mynde and wyll
neuer to rebell more nor to haue warr / he was
therof greatly abaſſhed / and had dyuers ymaginacyons / 
Wheder he ſhulde abyde ſtylle in
Gaunte (for all thynges was pardoned by the
dukes charter ſealed with his ſeale) or elles to
departe in to Englande with ſir Iohan Bourchier
and with the Englyſſhe men / who apparelled
them to go. And all thynges conſydred / 
he thought in hym ſelfe / that he coude nat truſt
this peace nor to abyde in Gaunte. And whan
Fraunces Atreman ſawe that he wolde nat abyde / 
he ſayd to him: Peter / what thynke ye to
do? Why do ye feare? ye knowe well / that by
this treatie ſealed by ye duke that for any thing
that is paſt / there ſhall neuer chalenge be made
to you for that. Than Peter anſwered & ſayd.
yea. in letters written lyeth nat all true ꝑdons.
Some pardoneth well by mouthe and gyueth
writyng therof / but yet the hatered remayneth
ſtyll in their corages: As for me I am a man of
the towne of Gaunt of ſmall reputacion / and of
baſe lynage / & to my power I haue ſuſteyned
the rightes / lyberties / & frācheſes of the towne.
Thynke you that wtin this two or thre yere the
people wyll remēbre it? I feare nay: There be
great lygnages in the towne of Gylbert Mathewes
and his bretherne / They wyll retourne
and they were enemyes to my mayſter Iohan

Leon / gladly I wolde neuer ſe theym / nor the
parentes of ſir Gylbert Brute nor of ſir Symon / 
Becte / who were by me ſlayne / wherfore
in this caſe I can nat be ſure of my lyfe. And
as for you Fraunces Atreman wyll you abyde
amonge ſuche a ſorte of treatours / who haue
ſo falſely broken their othe and promyſe to the
kynge of Englande? I ſwere to you truely ye
wyll repente it / for it wyll coſte you youre lyfe.
I can nat ſaye quod Fraunces / but I truſte ſo
well in this peace / and in the duke and ducheſſes
promyſe / that I wyll ieoparde to abyde.
               
                  THan Peter de Boyſe made a requeſt
to the aldermen and counſayle of the
towne: Sayeng / Fayre lordes / to my
power I haue truely ſerued the towne of Gaūt
and haue ben in many an harde aduenture in
that be halfe. And for all the good ſeruyce that
I haue done / In the name of rewarde / I aſke
none other thynge / but that I maye be ſauely
conducted with ſir Iohan Bourchier / whome
ye ſende in to Englande: This is all that I demaunde.
And they all aunſwered / it ſhulde be
done. And as for ſir Roger Emeryne and Iaques
Dardenbourcke / by whome this treatie
was firſte moued / they were ryght gladde of
his departure / and ſo were dyuers other notable
perſones in Gaunt / ſuche as loued the peace.
So thus Peter de Boyſe departed frome
Gaunte in the company of ſir Iohan Bourchier / 
and toke with hym all the ſubſtaūce that
he hadde: He was well furnyſſhed of golde / ſyluer / 
and ieowelles. And ſir Iohan Delle dyde
conducte them vnder the dukes ſalue conducte
to the towne of Calais / and than the gauntoiſe
retourned. Sir Iohan Bourchier and Peter
de Boyſe as ſoone as they might they wente in
to Englande / and came to the kyng and to his
vncles / and ſhewed them the dedes of theym of
Gaunte. The kynge made Peter de Boyſe
good chere / and ſo dyde the duke of Lancaſtre
and his bretherne / and gaue hym great thanke
in that he was come to them / and had abandoned
theym of Gaunte to come in to Englande.
The kyng incontynent retaygned hym & gaue
hym an hundred marke ſterlynge / yerely to be
payed out of the Staple of the wolles in London.
Thus Peter de Boyſe abode ſtyll in Englande / 
and the good towne of Gaunt in peace
And ſir Roger Emeryn was made chefe alder
man of the flete of Gaunt / whiche was a good
offyce and of great profyte / whan the ſhyppes
myght haue their courſe with marchaundyſe:
And ſir Iaques Dardēbourc was made chefe
ruler of all the meane Craftes in the towne of
Gaunte / whiche alſo was a great and a profytable
offyce.

there was no great dedes of armes likely towarde
in the parties of Picardy or Flaūders / 
Seyng the peace was made bytwene the duke

tourned to Luſenborne and aparelled his ſhyppes

thus the erle reteurned in to Englande. Thus
was the dealyng as than of the iourney in Portyngale.
            THe erle of Cambridge retourned in to
Englande on the maner as ye haue her
de before, and ſhewed his brother the Duke of
Lancaſtre all the dealynge of kynge Ferant of

you to kepe your owne people and your money
than to ſpende it abrode where as ye can gette
no profyte / and kepe and defende your owne he
rytage / wherin ye haue war
                  •
               e on all ſydes / as

well by Fraunce as by Scotlande / rather than
to enploy your tyme in other countreis. The
yonge kynge enclyned lightely to his wordes / 
for he loued him with all his hart bicauſe they
had been noriſſhed vp toguyder. And this erle
had great alyaunces / with dyuers lordes and
knightes of Englande / for he dyde all his maters
by the counſayle of ſir Symon Burle / ſir
Robert Treuelyen /

Tryuet and ſir Wylliam Helmon / were
named to be of the ſame ꝑte / ſo that by the dyffernes
and diſcorde bitwene the kynge and his
vncles / and the nobles and commons of the realme / 
many yuels came therby in Englāde / as
ye ſhall here hereafter in this hyſtorie.
            IT was nat longe after that the erle of
Cambridge departed out of Portyngale / 
but that the kynge Feraunt felle
ſicke / and ſo contynued a hole yere and dyed. &
than he had no mo chyldren but the Quene of
Spayne. Than kynge Iohan of Caſtell was
enformed of his deth / and howe that the realm
of Portyngale was fallen in to his hādes / and
howe that he was ryghtfull heyre thervnto / by
reaſon of the dethe of the kynge. Sother was
dyuers coūſayls kept on that mater / and ſome
ſayd / howe that the Portingales were ſo harde
harted people / yt they wold nat be had without
it were by conqueſt. And in dede whan the portyngales
ſawe howe they were without a kyng
than they determyned by counſayle to ſende to
a baſtarde brother of the kynges / a ſage and a
valyant man called Deuyſe / but he was a man
of relygton / and was mayſter of the hoſpytals
in all the realme / They ſayd they had rather be
vnder the rule of this maiſter Denyſe than vnder
the rule of the kynge of Caſtell / for they reputed
hym no baſtarde / that hath good corage
to do well. Whan this mayſter Denyſe vnderſtode
the cōmens wyll of foure chiefe cyties of
Portyngale (for they hadde great affectyon to
crowne hym kyng) wherof he had great ioye / 
and ſo wrote ſecretely to his frendes and came
to Lurbone / whiche is the kay of the realme.
The people of the towne receyued hym with
great ioye and demaūded of hym / if they crowned
him kyng: wheder he wolde be good to thē
or nat / and kepe the lande in their frauncheſe.
And he aunſwered and ſayd / he wolde be to thē
as they deſyred / and that they had neuer a better
kynge than he wolde be. Than they of Luxbone
wrote to Connubres / to Pount de portugale / 
and to them of Dourke: Theſe were the
kayes of the Realme / and ſo they determyned
to crowne to their kyng this mayſter Denyſe / 
who was a ſage & a valyant man and of good
gouernaūce / and was brother to kyng Ferant
for they ſawe well the realme coude nat be longe
without a kyng / as well for feare of the ſpay
mardes as of the myſcreātes of Granado and
of Bongie / who marched on them. So theſe
ſayde townes and certayne of the lordes of the
lande enclined to him / but ſome of ye lordꝭ ſayd
that it was nat mete a baſtarde to be crowned
kyng: And the people of the good townes ſaid
that it ſhulde be ſo: for of neceſſyte they muſt ſo
do / ſithe they had none other / and ſeyng that he
was a valyant and a ſage man / bothe in wy
                  •
               te
and in dedes of armes. And they toke enſample
by kynge Henry / who was crowned kyng
of Caſtell by electyon of the countrey / and for
the cōmon profyte / and that was done kynge
Peter beynge a lyue. So thus the electyon abode
on this maiſter Denyſe / and ſolemynely
he was crowned in the Cathedrall churche of
Connubres / by the accorde and puyſſaunce of
the cōmons of the realme. And there he ſware
to kepe iuſtyce & to do ryght to his people / and
to kepe and maynteyne their frauncheſes / and
to lyue and dye with them / wherof they hadde
great ioye.
            Whan theſe tidynges came to the hearyng
of don Iohan kyng of Caſtell / he was ſore diſpleaſed
therwith / and for two cauſes. The one
was bycauſe his wyfe was enheryter there / &
the other bycauſe the people by election hadde
crowned maiſter Denyſe kynge there. Wherfore
this kyng Iohan toke tytell to make warr
and to demaūde of them of Luxbone the ſōme
of two hundred thouſande florens / whiche Ferant
promyſed hym whan he toke his doughter
to his wyfe. So than he ſende the Erle of
Terme / therle of Ribydea / and the byſſhoppe
of Burges in to Portyngale / as his ambaſſadours
to them of Luxbone. & whan they were
at ſaynt prayne / the laſte towne of Caſtell towarde
Luxbone: Than they ſent an haraulde
to the kyng and to them of Luxbone / to haue a
ſaue conducte to go and come and to furnyſſhe
their voyage / whiche was graunted lightly / &
ſo they came to Luxbone / and ſo the towne aſſembled
their counſayle toguyder / and the ambaſſadours
ſhewed why they were come thyder / 
and finally ſayde. ye ſirs of Luxbone / ye

ought iuſtely nat to marueyle / if the kyng our
ſouerayne lorde demaundeth of you the ſōme
of money that ye are bounde for: And is nat cō
               tent
that ye haue gyuen ye noble crowne of Portyngale
to a clerke a man of relygion and a baſtarde:
It is a thynge nat to be ſuffred / for by
rightfull election / there is non nerer to ye crowne
thā he: And alſo / ye haue done this without
the aſſent of the nobles of the realme. Wherfore
the kyng our maiſter ſaythe / that ye haue done
yuell. And without that ye ſhortely do remedy
the make / he wyll make you ſharpe war
                  •
               . To
the whiche wordes don Feraunt Gallopes de
vyle fois / a notable burgeſſe of the cyte / anſwered
and ſayd. Sirs / ye reproche vs greatly for
our electyon but your owne election is as moche
reprouable / for ye crowned in Spaygne a
baſtarde / ſonne to a iewe: And it is clerely knowen,
that to the ryghtfull election / your kynge
hath no right to the realem of Portyngale / for
the right reſteth in the doughters of kyng Peter
/ who be in Englande maryed / bothe Conſtaūce
and Iſabell / maryed to the duke of I an
caſtre & to therle of Cambridge. Wherfore 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
               s / 
ye may departe whan ye wyll / and retourne to
them that ſent you hyder / and ſay that our electyon
is good / whiche we wyll kepe / and other
kyng we wyll haue none / as long as he lyſte to
be our kyng. And as for ye ſōme of money that
ye demaūde of vs / we ſay we are nothyng boū
               de
therto / take it of them that were boūde therfore
/ and of ſuche as had the profyte therof. At
this anſwere the kynge of Portyngall was nat
preſent
                  •
                howbeit he knewe well what ſhulde be
ſayd. And whā theſe ambaſſadours ſawe they
coude haue non other anſwere / they toke their
leaue and departed / and retourned to Cyuell / 
where they lafte the kyng and his coūſayle / to
whom they ſhewed all the ſaid anſwere. Than
the kyng of Spayne toke coūſayle what was
beſt to do in this mater. Than it was determyned
that the kyng of Portyngale ſhulde be deſied
/ and howe that the kyng of Spayne had a
good quarell to moue the warre for dyuers reaſons.
So than kyng Denyſe was defyed & all
his helpers in Portyngale. Than the kyng of
Spayne made a gret ſōmons of men of war
                  •
               
to lay ſiege to the cytie of Luxbone / & the kyng
ſayd / he wolde neuer departe thens tyll he had
it / for they had anſwered hym ſo proudely / that
they ſhuld derely repent it / if he might ouercōe
them. Thus the king of Caſtell with all his puiſſaūce
came to ſaynt yrayne. At yt ſeaſon there
was a knight chaſed 
                  •
               ut of his court / who was
called ſir Nauret / For if the kyng myght haue
gette hym / it ſhulde haue coſt hym his h
                  •
               ed. the
knight had knowledge therof / for he hadde many
good frendes. So he auoyded the Realme
of Caſtell and came to Luxbone to the kyng of
Portyngale / who had great ioye of his comynge
/ and retayned hym & made hym a great capitayne
/ and he dyde after moche hurte to the
ſpayniardes. The kynge of Caſtell departed
fro ſaynt yrayne / and came and layde ſiege before
the cytie of Luxbone / and encloſed therin
the kynge of Portyngale. The ſiege endured
more than a hole yere / and conſtable of the hoſt
was the erle of Longueuyll / and Marſhall of
the hooſt was ſir Raynolde Lymoſyn / he was
a knight of Limoſyn / who long before came in
to Spaygne with ſir Bertram of Cleſquy in
the firſte warres that he made in Spaygne.
This ſir Raynolde was a valiant knight and
well proued / And the kynge had well maryed
hym to a fayre lady / & to a fayre herytage: And
by her he had two ſonnes Raynolde and Henry.
And he was greatly prayſed in the realme
of Caſtell for his prowes / and with the kynge
of Caſtell there was Dagheynes Mandake / 
ſir Dygo Perſement / don Peter Roſeament / 
don Maryche de Verſaulx portugaleys / who
were turned ſpayniſſhe / and the great mayſter
of Caleſtrane and his brother / a yong knyght
called don Dighemeres / Pier Gouſſart of ſelme
/ Iohan Radigo de Hoyes / & the great mayſter
of ſaint Iaques. The kyng had well with
hym a thyrtie thouſande men. There were dyuers
aſſautes and ſcrimyſſhes / and many feates
of armes done / on the one parte and on the
other. The ſpaygnierdes knewe well that the
kynge of Portyngale ſhulde haue none ayde of
the nobles of his realme, for the commons had
made hym kyng agaynſt their wylles. So the
kyng of Caſtell had intenſyon to cōquere Luxbone
and all the countre / or he retourned / for he
ſawe well they ſhulde haue none ayde without
it were out of Englande / wherof he had mooſt
doute. And yet whan he had well ymagined▪ he
ſawe well the Englyſſhe men were farr of / and
he had herde howe they kynge of Englāde and
his vncles were nat all of the beſt acorde. wherfore
he thought hym ſelfe the more of ſur
                  •
               tie at
his ſiege / whiche ſiege was right plentyfull of
all thynges. There was in no market in Caſtell
more plentie than was ther. And the kyng
of Portyngale lay ſtyll in the cytie of Luxbone
at his caſe / for they coude nat take the See fro
hym. And he deimyned to ſende in to Englāde

to the kyng and to the duke of Lancaſtre truſtie
ambaſſadours / to renewe the aliances made
before / bytwene the kyng and kyng Ferant
his brother: And alſo the ambaſſadours had
in charge to ſhewe the duke of Lancaſtre / that
in maryage he wolde gladly haue his doughter
Philyppe / and to make her quene of Portyngale
/ and to ſwere and ſeale a ꝑpetuall peace
and alyance bytwene them: And alſo promyſynge
hym (that if he wolde come thyder with
two or thre thouſāde men of warre / and as many
archers) to helpe and ayde hym to cōquere
his enherytaunce of Caſtell. On this meſſage
was apoynted two knightes / ſir Iohan Rade
goe & ſir Iohn̄ Tetedore / and an archedeaken
of Luxbone / called Marche de la Fugyre. So
they made them redy and toke the ſee and had
good wynde / and ſo ſayled towarde the fronters
of Englande. On the other ꝑte the kyng
of Caſtell laye a ſiege / and he was counſayled
to write in to Fraunce and in to Gaſcoyne / for
ſome ayde of knightes & ſquyers. for the ſpaynierdes
ſuppoſed well / that the kynge of Portyngale
had ſende for ſocoure in to Englande / 
to reyſe their ſiege: & they thought they wolde
nat be ſo taken / but that their puiſſaūce might
be ſtronge ynoughe to reſyſt the Englyſſhmen
and portugaleyſe. And as he was counſayled
ſo he dyde / and ſende letters and meſſangers
in to Fraunce / to dyuers knyghtes and ſquyers
/ ſuche as deſyred dedes of armes / and ſpecially
in the countrey of By
                  •
               rne in the countie
of Foiz / for there were plentie of good knightꝭ
deſyring dedes of armes: For though they had
ben brought vp with the erle of Foiz / as than
there was good peace bitwene hym and therle
of Armynake. So theſe meſſages of theſe two
kyngꝭ were nat ſone brought about / howe be it
the warres in other places ceaſed neuertheleſſe
as in Auuergne / in Tholouſyn / in Rouergue / 
and in the lande of Bygore. ¶Nowe lette vs

made to the prince and princeſſe: and
howe the countre of Gaſcoyne was
newly agayne in warre. Cap .xxii.

lyeth the ſtrong caſtell of Lourde / whiche was
englyſſhe euer ſythe that the countie of Bigore
was yelded to the kyng of England and to the
prince / for the redempcion of kynge Iohan of
Fraūce / by the treatie and peace made at Bertigny
before Charters / and after confyrmed at
Calais / as it hath ben ſhewed before in ye other
hyſtorie. Whan the prince of Wales was come
out of Englande / and that the kyng his father
bad gyuen hym in herytage / all the lande and
duchy of Acquſtayne / wherin there were two
archebiſſhoppes and .xxii. other byſſhoppes / &
that he was come to Burdea
                  •
               x on the ryuer of
Gyrone / & had taken the poſſeſſyōs of all theſe
landꝭ and lyen there a yere. Than he & the princeſſe
were deſyred by the erle Iohan of Armynake
/ that they wolde come in to the countre of
Bigore / in to the cytie of Tarbe to ſe that coū
               tre
whiche as than he had nat ſene before. And
the erle of Armynake thought that if the prince
and princeſſe were in Bygore / that the Erle of
Foiz wolde come and ſe them: and wher as he
dyd owe hym for his raunſome two hundred &
fyftie thouſande frankes / he thought he wolde
deſyre the prince and princeſſe to requyre the
erle of Foiz / to forgyue hym the ſame ſōme or
parte therof. So moche dyd the erle of Armynake
that at his inſtance / the prince and princes
cāe to the cytie of Tarbe. This towne is fayre
and ſtandeth in a playne countre / amonge the
fayre vynes: And it is a towne / cytie / and caſtell
/ cloſed with gates and walles / and ſeperated
eche fro other. Fro the mountayns of Byerne
and Catheloyne cometh the fayre ryuer of
Lyſſe / whiche ronneth throughe Tarbe / and
is as clere as a fountayne. And a fyue leages
thens is the towne of Morlance / parteyninge
to the erle of Foiz / at the entre of the countie of
Bierne / and vnder the mountayne / a ſite leages
fro Tarbe is the towne of Panne / whiche
alſo ꝑteyneth to the ſayd erle. The ſame tyme
that the prince & princes was at Tarbe / therle
of Foiz was at Panne. He was there bylding
of a fayre caſtell / ioyninge to the towne without

on the ryuer of Grane. Aſſone as he knewe
the comynge of the prince and princeſſe beyng
at Tarbe / He ordayned to go and ſe theym in
great eſtate / with mo than ſixe hundred horſes
and threſcore knightes in his company. And of
his comynge to Tarbe / was the prince and prī
               ceſſe
right ioyouſe and made hym good chere:
and there was the erle of Armynake & the lorde
Dalbret / and they deſyred the price to requyre
the erle of Foiz to forgyue therle of Armynake
all / or els parte of the ſomme of florens that he
ought to haue. And the prince who was wyſe
and ſage / conſyderynge all thynges / thought
that be might nat do ſo / and ſayde. Sir erle of
Armynake / ye were taken by armes in yt iourney
of batayle / and ye dyde putte my coſyn the
erle of Foiz in aduenture agaynſte you. And
thoughe fortune were fauourable to hym and

nor I wolde nat be contente that we ſhulde be
deſyred to leaue that we haue wonne by good

herde that he was a baſſhed / for he fayled of his

               red the princeſſe / who with a good
hert / deſyred therle of Foiz to gyue her a gyfte.
Madame quod the

therfore I can gyue no great gyftes. But madame
/ if the thyng that ye deſyre paſſe nat the
valure of threſcore thouſande frankes / I wyll
gyue it you with a gladde chere. yet the princeſſe
aſſayed agayne / if ſhe coude cauſe hym to
graunt her full deſyre. But the 
                  •
               rle was ſage
and ſubtell / and thought verily that her deſyre
was to haue hym to forgyue clerely the Erle of
Armynake all his dette. And than he ſayde agayne.
Madame / for a poore knight as I am / 
who buyldeth townes and caſtelles / the gyfte
that I haue graunted you ought to ſuffyce. the
princeſſe coude bringe hym no farther: & whan
ſhe ſawe that / ſhe ſaid. Gentyll erle of Foiz / the
requeſt that I deſyre of you / is to forgyue clerely
the erle of Armynake. Madame quod the
erle to your requeſt I ought well to condiſcend
                  •
               .
I haue ſayd to you / that if your deſyre paſſe
nat the valure of threſcore thouſande frankes / 
that I wolde graunt it you. But madame / the
erle of Armynake oweth me two hundred and
fyftie thouſande frankes: and at your requeſt / 
I forgaue hym therof threſcore thouſande frankes.
Thus the mater ſtode in that caſe / and the
erle of Armynake / at the requeſt of the princes
wan the forgyueng of threſcore thouſande frankes.
And anone after the erle of Foiz returned
to his owne countre.
            I Sir Iohan Froiſſarde make narracion
of this buſyneſſe / bycauſe whan
I was in the countie of Foyz and of
Bierne / I paſſed by the coūtie of Bygore. and
I demaunded and enquered of the newes of yt
countrey / ſuche as I knewe nat before: And it
was ſhewed me / howe the prince of wales and
of Aquitayne / whyle he was at Tarbe / he had
great wyll to go ſe the caſtell of Lourde / whiche
was a thre leages of / nere to the entre of the
mountayne / And whan he was there / and had
well aduyſed the towne / the caſtell / and the coū

/ he prayſed it greatly: aſwell for the ſtrēgth
of the caſtell / as bycauſe it ſtode on the fronter
of dyuers countreis / For the garyſone there / 
might ronne well in to the realme of Arragon / 
in to Catellon / and to Barſelon. Than the prī
               ce
called to hym a knyght of his houſholde / in
whom he had great truſte / and loued hym entierly:
and he had ſerued hym truely / and was
called ſir Pyer Ernalde / of the countre of Bierne
/ an experte man of armes and coſyn to the
erle of Foiz. Than the prince ſayde to hym. ſir
Ernalde / I inſtytue and make you Chateleyn
and capitayne of Lourde / & gouernour of the
countre of Bygore. Loke that ye kepe this caſtell
/ ſe well that ye make a good accompte ther
of / to the kyng my father and to me. Sir quod
the knyght I thanke you / and I ſhall obſerue
your cōmaundement. There he dyde homage
to the prince / and the prince put hym in poſſeſſion.
It is to be knowen / that whan the warre
began to renewe bytwene Englande & Fraūce
as it hath ben ſhewed before: The erle Guy of
ſaynt Poule and ſir Hugh of Chatellon mayſter
of the croſbowes in Fraunce / in that tyme
beſeged the towne of Abuyle / and wan it / with
all the countre of Poitou. The ſame tyme two
great barons of Bigore / thone called ſir Marnalte
Barbeſan and the lorde Danchyn tourned
frenche / and toke the towne / cytie / and caſtell
of Tarbe / whiche was but eaſely kept for
the kynge of Englande: But ſtyll the caſtell of
Lourde / was in the handes of ſir Pier Ernalt
of Bierne / who wolde in no wyſe yelde vp the
caſtell / but made euer great warre agaynſt the
realme of Fraūce / and ſent for great company
of aduenturers in to Bierne and Gaſcoyne / to
helpe and to ayde hym to make warre / ſo that

he had togyder many good men of armes. and
he had with hym ſixe capitayns / & euery man
fyftie ſpeares vnder hym.
            The firſt was his brother Iohan of Bierne
a right expert ſquyer / and Pier Danchyne of
Bygore / brother germayne to the lorde Danchyne
/ he wolde neuer tourne frenche / Nandon
of ſaynt Colombe / Ermalton of mount Ague
of ſaynt Baſyll / and the Bourge of Carnela.
Theſe capitayns made dyuers iourneys in to
Bygore / in to Tholouſyn / in to Carcaſſene / &
in to Albygoiſe: For euer aſſone as they were
out of Lourde / they were in the lande of their
enemyes / and ſomtyme they wolde aduenture
thyrtie leages of fro their holde. And in their
goynge / they wolde take nothyng / but in their
retourne there was nothynge coulde ſcape thē.
Somtyme they brought home ſo great plentie
of beeſtes & priſoners / that they wyſt nat howe
to kepe them. Thus they raūſomed all the coū
               trey
excepte the erle of Foiz landes / For in his
landes they durſte nat take a chekyn / withoute
they payed truely therfore: For if they had diſpleaſed
the erle / they coulde nat longe haue endured.
Theſe companyons of Lourde ranne
ouer all the countre at their pleaſure / & I rode
nat farre fro theym. Thus the cytie of Tarbe
was in great doute / ſo that they were fayne to
make couynaunt with thē. And bytwene Tarbe
and Lourde / there was a great vyllage and
a good abbey called Gynors / who in lykewiſe
were fayne to agre with them. Alſo on ye other
parte on the ryuer of Lyſſe / there was a great
towne called Bagueres / they of that towne had
a harde ſeaſon / for they were ſo haryed by the
garyſon of Maluoyſen ſtandynge on a hylle / 
and the ryuer of Lyſſe rynnyng vnderneth / vnto
a walled towne called Turney / in to the whiche
towne they of Lourde and of Maluoyſen
hadde euer their recourſe / to the whiche towne
they dyde no hurte / bycauſe they had their reſorte
thyder: And they of the towne had euer a
good market of their pyllage / and ſo diſſymuled
euer with them / whiche they were fayne to
do / or elles they coulde nat haue lyued / for they
had no ayde nor ſocoure of any perſone: the capitayne
of Maluoyſen was a gaſcoyne / & his
name was Remonet de Leſpe / an experte man
of armes. He and his company & they of Lourde
/ raūſomed as well the marchauntes of Aragon
and Catheloyne as of Fraunce / without
they agreed with them.
            In the ſeaſon that I enterpriſed to go ſe the
erle of Foiz / and to ſe the dyuerſities of the coū
               treys
/ where as I had neuer ben before. Whan
I departed fro Carcaſſene / I lefte the waye to
Tholous and wente to Monterorall and ſo to
Fonges / than to Bell / and than to the firſt towne
of therle of Foiz / and than to Maſters / and
ſo to the caſtell of Sanredyn. And than I cāe
to the good cytie of Pauyers / ꝑteyning to the
erle of foiz / and there I taryed / abydinge for
ſome company goyng in to the countre of Byerne
/ where the erle was: And whan I had taryed
there a thre dayes in great pleaſure / for yt
cytie was deleetable / ſtādyng among the fayre
vynes / and enuyroned with a fayre ryuer large
& clere / called Liege. And on a day it ſo fortuned
/ that thyder came a knyght of the erle of
Foiz fro Auignon warde / called ſir Eſpaenge
de Lion / a valyant & an experte man of armes / 
about the age of .l. yeres. And ſo I gate me in
to his company / and he was greatly deſyrous
to here of the maters of Fraunce / & ſo we were
a ſixe dayes in our iourney / or we came to Ortayſe.
And this knyght euery day after he had
ſayd his prayers mooſt parte all the day after / 
he toke his paſtyme with me / in demaundyng
of tidynges: and alſo whan I demaūded any
thyng of hym / he wolde anſwere me to my purpoſe.
And whan we departed fro Pauyers we
paſt by the moūt of Ceſſe / whiche was an yuell
paſſage / and ſo we came to the towne & caſtell
of Ortayſe whiche was frenche / but we paſſed
by it / and ſo came to dyner to a caſtell of the
                  •
               le
of Foiz halfe a leage thens called Carlat / ſtandynge
highe on a mountayne. and after dyner
the knight ſayd to me. ſir / let vs ryde toguyder
fayre & eaſely / we haue but two leages to ryde
to our lodgyng / & ſo I was content to do. than
the knight ſaid / we haue this day paſſed by the
caſtell of Ortayſe / which dothe moche domage
in this countre. Peter Danchyn kepeth it / and
bath taken and ſtollen out of the realme of Frā
               ce
/ more than threſcore thouſande frākes. than
I demaūded how that might be. I ſhall ſhewe
you quod the knight. On our lady day in Auguſt
there is euer a great fayre / and all the coū
               tre
reſorteth thyder / for there is moche marchā
               diſe.
That day Pier Danchyn and his cōpanions
of Lourde had taken their aduyſe / & were
determyned to get this towne and caſtell. And
ſo they ſent two ſimple varlettꝭ (by ſemyng) to
the ſayd towne in the moneth of Maye / to get
them ſelfe ſome ſeruyce in the towne / & ſo they
dyde / and were reteyned with two maiſters / &
they dyde right dilygent ſeruyce to their mayſters.
And ſo went in and out on their maiſters

buſyneſſe
                  •
                without any ſuſpeciouſnes of thē. &
ſo on our lady day in Auguſt ther were many
marchantes ſtrangers. of Foiz / of Bierne / & of
Fraūce. And as ye knowe well / whan machantes
do mete that ſawe nat togyder long before / 
they wyll make good chere togyder. & ſo in the
ſame houſes where as theſe two varlettꝭ were ī
ſeruice / were many marchantes drinkyng and
makyng good chere / & their oſtes with them. &
by apoyntment about midnight / Pier Dāchin
and his cōpany cāe to Ortaiſe / & enbuſſhed thē
               ſelfe
in a wode whiche paſſed throughe. And ſo
they ſent ſixe varlettꝭ to the towne with .ii. ladders / 
& they paſſed the dykes & came to the walles
and reared vp their ladders / & the other .ii.
varlettes that were in ſeruice in the towne dyd
ayde thē / while their mayſts ſat makyng good
chere: ſo theſe ſayd varlettes dyde put thē ſelfe
in aduenture / and one of the ſaid two varlettes
brought the other ſixe to the gate within / wher
there was two men kepyng the keys / than this
varlet ſaid to the other ſixe. ſirs▪ kepe your ſelfe
here priuy & cloſe / and ſtyrre nat tyll ye here me
whiſtle. I truſt to make the porters to open the
gate of their warde / they haue the keyes of the
great gate / & therfore aſſone as they haue opyned
their warde I wyll whyſtle: Than ſteppe
forthe & ſlee the porters / I knowe well ynoughe
the keyes of the gate / for I haue oft tymes helped
to kepe the gate with my maiſter / & as they
deuyſed ſo they dyd. & ſo the varlet went to the
gate / and ſawe & herde howe the porters were
drīkyng within their warde: than he called thē
by their names & ſaid. ſirs open yor dore / I haue
brought you of the beſt wyne that euer you
dranke / which my maiſter hath ſent you / to the
entent you ſhulde kepe your watche the better.
And they who knewe right well the varlet / beleued
that he had ſaid trouthe & opyned the dore / 
and than he whiſtled / & thother ſixe ſtept forthe
and entred in at the dore / & there they ſlewe the
porters ſo priuely / that none knewe therof. thā
they toke the keyes & went and opyned ye gate / 
and let downe the bridge eaſely yt none knewe
therof: Than they blewe a blaſt in a horne / ſo yt
they that were enbuſſhed moūted on their horſes / 
& came on the ſpurres & entred on the bridge
& come in to the towne: & ſo toke all the men
of the towne ſyttyng drīkyng or
                  •
               ls in their beddes.
Thus was Ortayſe taken by Pier Danchin
of Bigore & by his cōpanyons of Lourde / 
than I demaūded of the knight howe they gat
the caſtell / I ſhall ſhewe you ꝙ he. The ſame
tyme that Ortaiſe was thus taken / the capiten
of the caſtell by his yuell aduenture was in the
towne & ſupped with certayne marchauntes of
Carcaſſen / and was there taken among other:
and in ye next mornyng Pier Dāchyn brought
him before the caſtell / wher as his wyfe & chyldren
were / & made thē beleue that he wolde ſtrike
of his heed / wtout his wife wolde delyuer vp
the caſtell. & if ſhe wolde ſo do / he ꝓmiſed to delyuer
her huſbande quyte / & to ſuffre hym & all
his to deꝑte with bagge & baggage wtout any
hurt. and the lady who ſawe herſelfe in a harde
caſe / & ſawe ſhe was nat able to make ware her
ſelfe / & for ſauyng of her huſbādes lyfe / ſhe yelded
vp the caſtell: & ſo her huſbāde and ſhe & all
theirs / deꝑted & went to Pauiers. Thus had
Pier Dāchin the towne & caſtell of Ortayſe. &
the ſame tyme that they entred / he & his cōpany
wan aboue .xxx.M. frākes / what in marchandiſe
& priſoners of Frāce: but all ſuche as were
of the coūtie of Foiz or of B
                  •
               erne / were clene delyuered
wtout any domage. & this Pier Danchyn
kept Ortaiſe after / the ſpace of .v. yere: &
he & his cōpany oftymes wolde ron to the gatꝭ
of Carcaſſon / whiche was a ſixe leages thens
and dyde great domage to the countre / as well
by raunſomynge of the townes / as by pyllage
ouer all the countrey.
            In the meane ſeaſon that Pier Dāchin was
in the gariſon of Ortaiſe / On a night certayne
of his cōpany went out & came to a caſtel called
Paiel
                  •
               er a good leage thens / wherof a frenche
knight called Raymon du Pailier was owner
they had ben ther often before & fayled of their
purpoſe but as thā their happe was ſuche that
they ſcaled the caſtell & toke it / & the knight and
the lady in their beddes: And let the lady & her
children go fre / but they kept ſtyll the knight in
his owne caſtell the ſpace of foure monethes / &
at laſt he payed a .M. frākes for his raūſome.
And fi
                  •
               ally whan they had ſore ouerryden the
coūtre they ſolde theſe two caſtels / Ortaiſe and
Paielier to thē of the coūtre for .viii.M. frankes / 
& than they went to Lourde their prīcipall
garyſon. So thus in this aduenture knightes
dyd put thē ſelfe dayly. alſo the ſame tyme ther
was an expert man of armes in ye caſtell of lourde
a gaſcone borne / he was called le Mēgeant
of ſaynt Baſyll: On a tyme he & .xxx. with him
deꝑted fro Lourde & rode at all aduenturee in
to Tho
                  •
               ouſyn / & had thought to haue gote the
caſtell of Penne in Allugois / but he myſt of his

                  •••
               ent. and whan he ſawe that he fayled of his
purpoſe / he cāe to the gate & made a great ſcrymiſſhe:

and the ſame proper hour the ſeneſhall
of Tholous rode forthe & with hym ſir Hughe
de Froid wyll and a .lx. ſpeares / & came by aduenture
to Pan while the ſayd ſcrimyſſhe was
in doyng. Than incontynent they ſette fote to
the erthe & came to the barryers: and ſo than
the Mengeant was ouer matched / but ther he
fought valiantly hande to hande / and woūded
the other knight in two or thre places / howe be
it finally he was taken by force / & his men outher
taken or ſlayne / ther were but a fewe that
ſcaped. So this Mēgeant was ledde to Tholous / 
and than the cōmons of the towne wolde
haue ſlayne hym bitwene the handꝭ of the ſeneſhall
/ he had moche payne to ſaue his lyfe / & ſo
brought hym in to the caſtell / for he was ryght
yuell beloued in Tholous. yet after it happed
ſo well for hym / that the duke of Berry cāe thider / 
and this knyght had ſuche frendes that he
was delyuered / & the ſeneſhall had a thouſande
frankes for his raūſome: and whan he was delyuered
he retourned to Lourde / and began agayne
to make newe enterpriſes. And ſo on a
tyme he departed fro Lourde & fyue with hym
without any armoure / and he dyde on the abbyt
of a monke & lyke other thre monkes with
hym / and they had all ſhauen crownes / ſo that
euery man that ſawe them / wende ſurely that
they had ben monkes / the abbit and geſture be
came them ſo well. And in this maner he came
to Mountpellyer and toke vp his lodgynge at
the ſigne of the Egle / and ſaid howe he was an
abbot of high Gaſcon / & was goyng to Parys
on certayne buſyneſſe ꝑteyning to his houſe. &
ſo he gate famylier aquayntaūce with a ryche
man of the towne called Barēger / who had alſo
to do at Paris for certayne buſyneſſe. Than
this abbot ſaid howe he wolde pay for his coſtꝭ
if he lyſt to go in his cōpany Wherof the good
man was right ioyouſe / in that he ſhulde haue
his charges borne / & ſo he and one varlet with
hym went forthe with this monke. And whan
they had ryden a thre leagꝭ / this coūterfet monke
ſir Mēgeant toke him priſoner / & ledde him
ſecret wayes to his gariſon of Lourde / & after
dyd raūſome him at .v.M. frākes. than I ſaid
ah ſaint Mary / was this Mēgeant ſuche an expert
man of arme
                  •
               
               ▪ ye truely ſir ꝙ he / & in war
he dyed / in a place wher as we ſhall paſſe with
in this thre dayes / in a coūtre called the Layre ī
Bigore / by a towne called Lachmache. well ſir
quod I / & I ſhall remēbre you therof whan we
come ther. & ſo we rode tyll we came to Mōſte
que
                  •
                a good towne cloſed / ꝑteyning to therle of
Foiz / whiche the Armynagois & the labriſyēce
toke by ſtelthe on a ſeaſon / but they kept it nat
but thre dayes. & in the mornyng we deꝑted fro
Mōſtequen & rode to the towne of Palamuche
a good towne cloſed on the ryuer of Garon / ꝑteyning
to therle of Foiz: And whan we were
almoſt ther we had thought to haue paſſed the
bridge of Garon / to haue entred in to the towne / 
but we coulde nat / for ye day before it had ſo
ſore rayned fro the moūtayns of Chataloyne &
Aragon / wherby another ryuer was ſo encreaſed
whiche was called Saluz & ran ſo faſt / that
it reyſed vp the ryuer of Garon in ſuche wiſe / yt
it brake one of the arches of the bridge / whiche
was of tymbre / wherfore we returned agayne
to Monteſtquen / and taryed there all the day.
Than the next day the knight had coūſayle to
paſſe the ryuer by botes by the towne of Caſſeres:
ſo we rode thider & dyd ſo moche yt we paſt
the ryuer of Garon with great payne & ꝑell / for
the bote that we were in was nat very great / it
coude nat take at one tyme but two horſes and
their kepars / & they that ruled the bote: and ſo
whan we were ouer we rode to Caſſeres and a
bode there all that daye / & in the meane tyme yt
our ſupper was a dreſſyng / this knight ſaid to
me. ſir Iohan / let vs go & ſe the towne: & ſo we
paſſed a long through the towne and cāe to the
gate towarde Palamuche and went out therat
and came to the dykes: Than the knyght ſhewed
me a pane of the wall and ſaid. ſir / ſe you

               e of the wall whiche is newer than
all the remnant? yea ſir ꝙ I▪ well ꝙ he / I ſhall
ſhewe you why it is ſo / it is a ten yere paſt ſithe
it fortuned. ye haue herde or this / of the warre
that was bytwene the erle of Armynacke and
therle of Foiz / howe be it nowe they are in peace:
But the armynagoiſe and Labriſience wan
but lytell by that warre. For on a ſaynt Nycholas
euyn / the yere of our lorde a thouſande
thre hūdred threſcore and two: Therle of Foiz
toke in batayle therle of Armynake & the lorde
Dalbret his nephue / and all the noble men that
were with them / and ſo ledde thē as priſoners
to Ortaiſe / wherby the erle of Foiz hath receyued
ten tymes a hundred thouſande frankes.
And it fortuned after / that the father of the erle
of Armynake nowe lyueng / called ſir Iohan of
Armynake / made a iourney & toke this towne
of Caſſeres / and they had with them a .ii. hundred
men of armes / and ſo thought to kepe the
towne by ſtrength. Theſe tidynges whan they
came to the knowledge of the erle of Foiz / beynge
as tha
                  ••
               e at Panne. He lyke a ſage and a

valyant knight / called to hym two baſtard bretherne
of his▪ called 
                  •
                Arnalt Guyllam and ſir
Pier de Bierne / and ſayd to them. ſirs / I wyll
ye ryde incontynent to Caſſ
                  •
               eres / I ſhall ſende
you men on euery ſyde / and within thre dayes
I ſhalbe with you my ſelfe: and let none come
out of the towne / but that ye fight with thē / for
ye ſhalbe ſtronge ynoughe. And whan ye come
there / cauſe the men of the countre to bring thyder
great plentie of wode / buſſhes / and fagottꝭ
and choke the gates therwith: and than wtout
that / make ſtronge barryers / for I wyll yt they
that be within be ſo encloſed / that they iſſue nat
out of the gares / I ſhall cauſe them to take another
way. Theſe two knightes dyd his cōmaū
               dement
and ſo wente to Palamuche / & all men
of warre of Bierne folowed them / and ſo they
came before this towne of Caſſeres. they that
were within ſette lytell by them / but they were
nat were howe they were encloſed within the
towne / ſo that they coulde nat iſſue oute at any
gate. And the thirde day / the erle of Foiz came
thider with fyue hūdred men of armes: and as
ſone as he came / he cauſed barryers to be made
rounde about the towne / & alſo barriers roūde
about his hoſt / bycauſe they ſhulde nat be troubled
in the night tyme. ſo in this caſe they laye
longe without any aſſaut / in ſo moche that vitayle
began to fayle them within / for thoughe
they had wyne great plentie they had nothyng
to eate: Nor they coulde nat flye awaye by the
ryuer / for it was as than̄e to depe. Than they
thought it were better to yelde thē ſelfe as priſoners / 
than to dye ſo ſhamefully for famyne / &
ſo fell in treaty. Therle of Foiz agreed to their
treatie / ſo that they ſhulde nat iſſue oute at no
gate / but to make a hole in the wall and go out
therat / to come one by one without armoure / &
ſo to yelde them as priſoners. It behoued thē
to take this waye / and ſo made a hole in ye wall
and iſſued oute one by one. And there was the
erle redy and all his people in order of batayle
to receyue them as priſoners. and euer as they
came out / the Erle ſent them to dyuers caſtelles
as priſoners: and his coſyn ſir Iohn̄ of Armynake / 
ſir Bernarde Dalbret / and ſir Manalt
of Barlabaſon / ſir Raymōde de Benache
ſir Benedicke de la Corneyle / and a twentie of
the beſte perſonages he ledde with hym to Ortaiſe / 
and or they departed / he had of them two
hundred thouſande trāke
                  •
               : and thus was this
hole in the wall made / & than we wente to our
ſupper. And the nexte day we rode a longe by
the ryuer of Garon and paſſed by Palamuche
and than we entred in to the lande of the erle of
Comynges and Armynake / and on the other
ſyde was the ryuer of Garon / and the lande of
therle of Foiz. And as we rode / this knight ſhewed
me a ſtronge towne called Marteras the
Touſſa
                  •
                / ꝑteyninge to therle of Comynges / &
on the other ſyde of the ryuer on the moūtayne
He ſhewed me two caſtelles parteyninge to the
erle of Foiz / the one called Mountarall and the
other Mountclare. And as we rode bytwene
theſe townes and caſtelles a longe by the ryuer
of Garon in a fayre medowe / this knight ſayd
to me. ſir Iohan / I haue ſene here many fayre
ſcrimyſſhes and encountrynges / bytwene the
foizois and armynakes / for as than there was
no towne nor caſtell but that was well furnyſſhed
with men of warre / & ſo they warred eche
vpon other. The armynakes agaynſt yonder
two caſtelles made a baſtyde / and kept it with
men of warre / and dyde moche hurt in the erle
of Foiz lande: But I ſhall ſhewe you howe it
fortuned. The erle of Foiz on a night ſent his
brother Peter de Bierne with two hūdred ſperes / 
and with them a four hundred villayns of
the countre / charged with fagottꝭ moche wode
and buſſhes / and brought it to the baſtide. and
than ſette fyre theron and ſo brent the baſtyde / 
and all them that were within without mercy.
and ſithe it was neuer made agayne. So in ſuche
deuyſes we rode all that day a longe by the
ryuer of Garon / and what on the one ſyde and
on the other / we ſawe many fayre caſtelles and
fortreſſes. All that were on our lyfte hande parteyned
to therle of Foiz / and the other ſyde parteyned
to therle of Armynake. And ſo thus we
paſſed by Montpeſac a fayre caſtell & a ſtrōge
ſtandyng on an highe rocke / & vnderneth was
the towne and the highe way: and without the
towne a lytell / there was a place called ala gardea / 
and a towre bitwene the rocke and the ryuer / 
whiche towre had a gate and a portcolyſe
of yron. ſixe men might well kepe this paſſage
agaynſt all the worlde / for there coulde no man
paſſe but two on a front / what for the towre on
the one ſyde & the ryuer on the other ſyde. than
I ſayd to the knyght / ſir / here is a ſtronge paſſage
and a myghtie countre / it is true quod the
knight: and though thentre be ſtronge / yet the
erle of Foiz dyde conquere it ones / and he & all
his paſſed the ſame waye with the helpe of the
archers of Englāde / that he had as than in his
company / and the great deſyre that they had to
paſſe in to the countre. Come ryde nere me ſir
quod he / & I ſhall ſhewe you howe it was / and

ſo I rode iuſte by hym 
                  •
                and than he ſayd: Sir / 
on a tyme the Erle of Armynake and the lorde
Dalbret with a fyue hūdred men of warre / cāe
in to the countre of Foiz and to the marches of
Pauyers. And this was in the begynnynge of
Auguſt / whan men dyd gather in their cornes
and ye grapes were rype / at whiche tyme there
was great habundaunce in the countre. Than
ſir Iohan of Armynake and his company lodged
before the towne Sauredun / a lytell leage
fro the cytie of Pauyers. And he ſente to them
of Pauyers / that without they wolde bye their
cornes and wynes / and pay for them: they ſaid
els they wolde brinne and diſtroy all togyder.
Than they of Pauiers were in great feare / for
the Erle their lorde was farre of fro them: for
he was as than in Byerne. And ſo they were
fayne to bye their owne cornes / and payed for
them fyue thouſande frankes / but they deſyred
fyftene dayes of reſpyte / whiche was graūted
them. Than the erle of Foiz was enformed of
all this būſyneſſe / and he haſted hym as moche
as he might / and aſſembled toguyder his men
and came ſodaynly in to the cytie of Pauyers
with .xii. hundred ſpeares. And ſo had fought
with ſir Iohan of Armynake if he had taryed / 
but he departed and wente in to the countie of
Comynges. So he had no money of them of
Pauyers / for they had no leyſar to tarye therfore.
But than therle of Foiz claymed the ſame
ſome / for he ſayd he was come / and ſaued their
money and corne: and had put awaye all their
ennemyes. And ſo he had it to paye his men of
warre therewith / and there he taryed tyll they
had inned all their corne and vyntage. And ſo
we paſſed than foreby a caſtell called Bretytte / 
and alſo by another caſtell called Bacelles / all
parteyninge to the erle of Comynges: and as
we rode a long by the ryuer / I ſawe a fayre caſtell
and a great towne / & I demaunded of the
knight what the caſtell was called. and he ſaid
it was named Monteſplayne / parteyninge to
a coſyn of the erle of Foiz / called ſir Roger Deſpaygne / 
a great barone in the countre / and in
Tholouſyn: and as than was ſeneſhall of Carcaſſoney.
Than I demaunded of this knight / 
if he were a kynne to ſir Charles of Spayne / 
who was conſtable of Fraunce: and he anſwered
and ſayde / no / he is nat of that blode. For
ſir Loyes of Spaygne and this ſir Charles
that ye ſpeke of
                  •
               came bothe out of the realme of
Spayne / & were lynially extraught of ſpayne
and of Fraunce / by their mothers ſyde / & were
coſyn germayns to kynge Alphons of Spaygne:
and I ſerued in my youthe / ſir Loyes of
Spaygne in the warres of Bretaygne / for he
was alwayes on the partie of ſir Charles of
Bloyes / agaynſt the erle Moūtforde. And ſo
we lefte ſpckynge of that matter / and rode to
ſaynte Gouffens / a good towne of the Erle of
Foiz. and the next day we dyned at Monreyle
a good ſtronge towne of the Frenche kynges / 
and ſir Roger de Spaygne kepte it. And after
dyner we rode the waye towardes Lourde
and ſo rode throughe a great launde / endurynge
a fyftene leages / called the laundes Lann
                  •
               
de vous / wherin were many daungerous paſſages / 
for theues and yuell doers. And in this
launde ſtode the caſtell of Meſere / parteyninge
to the erle of Foiz / a good leage fro the towne
of Tourney / the whiche caſtell the knyght
ſhewed me and ſayd. Sir / beholde yonder is
Maluoyſen / But ſir / haue ye herde here before
howe the duke of Aniou / whan he was in this
countrey and wente to Lourde? What he dyde
in this countre / & howe he layde ſiege to Lourde / 
and wanne it. And alſo the caſtell of Gryngalet / 
on the ryuer ſide that ye ſe yonder before
vs / parteyneth to the lorde de la Batte. Than
I remembred my ſelfe / and ſaid. Sir / I trowe
I neuer herde therof as yet / therfore I pray
                  •
               
you ſhewe me the mater. But ſir / I praye you
ſhewe me where is the ryuer of Garon become
for I can ſe it no more. ye ſay trouthe quod the
knight / it departeth here / in thentryng of theſe
mountayns / and it groweth and cometh out of
a foūtayne a thre leages hens / the way to Chatelomy / 
by a caſtell called ſaynt Beart / the fronter
of the realme of Fraunce towarde Aragon:
And there is as nowe / a ſquyer called Ermalton / 
otherwyſe called Bourge de Spaygne.
He is lorde therof / and 
                  •
               hatelayne of all the coū
               trey / 
and he is coſyn germayne to ſir Roger de
Spayne / if we ſe hym I ſhall ſhewe you him.
He is a goodly perſone and a good man of armes / 
and he hath done more domage to theym
of Lourde / than any other knyght or ſquyer of
all the countre: and the erle of Foiz loueth him
ryghtwell / for he is his companyon in armes.
¶I wyll leaue to ſpeke of hym / for I thynke
at this feeſt of Chriſtmas / ye ſhall ſe him in the
erle of Foiz houſe: but nowe I ſhall ſhewe you
of the duke of Aniou howe he came in to this
countre / and what he dyde. Than we
rode forthe fayre and eaſely / and
he began to ſaye as foloweth.

But whan ſir Robert Canoll was within the

It is true quod the knyght: it was ſo
that ſir Garſes of the caſtella right valyaunt
knight of the countre and good frenche / wente
to the duke of Aniou / to cauſe hym to come before
Beauuoſyn. The duke had made his ſommons

he came to the duke and ſayd. Sir What ſhall

them that the caſtell is nat gyuen vp / & it were
great pytie that they ſhulde dye / for they be gē

the duke began to chafe and ſayd▪ ſir Olyuer
do therin as ye thynke beſt. Than quod ſir
Olyuer / I wyll that they leſe their lyues / there
is good cauſe why / ſithe they kepe nat their ꝓmyſe.
Than ſir Olyuer departed fro the duke
and came to a place before the Caſtell / and ſir
Garſes durſt nat ſpeke one worde for them / for
if he had / he ſhulde haue loſt his labour / ſith ſir
Olyuer had taken on hym the enterpriſe, than
he called the hangman / & made hym ſtryke of
the heedes of two knyghtes and two ſquyers / 
whiche was great pytie / & there were mo than
two hundred in the ho
                  •
               ſt that wepte / for them.
And incontynent ſir Robert Canoll opyned a
poſterne gate / and on the brimme of the dykes
in diſpyte of the frenche men / he cauſed to ſtryke
of the heedes of all the priſoners that he had
without any reſpyte / and incentynent opyned
the caſtell gate and lette downe the bridge / and
iſſued out and 
                  〈◊〉
                to the barryers / and ſcrymyſſhed
with the frenche men. And as ſir Garſes
ſhewed me / they was a ſore ſcrimyſſhe / and
there ſir Olyuer Cl
                  •
               ſquyn was hurt / and ſo returned
to his lodgyng. There were thre good
men of armes (two ſquyers of the countrey of
B
                  •
               erne) Bettram de Baruge and Eualton de
Payne / and they were bothe ſore hurt. and the
next day the duke diſlodged and went fro Dyryuall
to Tholous to the entente to diſtroye
Lourde / for they of Tholous cōplayned greatly
of the garyſon of Lourde.
            ¶So than the duke went firſt and layd ſiege

to Maluoyſen / whiche we maye ſe yonder before
vs: and the duke had in his company an
vi
                  •
               i. thouſande men of warre / beſyde the geneuoys
and the cōmons of the good townes. Capitayne
as than of Maluoyſen / was a ſquyer
of Gaſcoyne called Raymonde de Leſp
                  •
               an experte
man of armes. Euery day at the barriers
there was ſcrimyſſhes and goodly feates of armes
done: & the duke laye in yonder fayre medowes / 
bytwene the towne of Turney and the
caſtell by the ryuer ſyde of Lyſſe. This ſiege
enduryng ſir Garſes marſhall of thooſt / went
with fyue hundred men of armes and two hundred
archers and croſbowes / and a two thouſande
of other cōmons / and layd ſiege to the caſtell
of Trygalet / whiche we haue lefte here be
hynde vs / whiche caſtell a ſquyer of Gaſcoyne
kepte / for the lorde de la Barde: for he was his
coſyn / and was called the Baſtot of Manlyon
and he had within the caſtella .xl. companyons
and they dyd in that countre ſuche mayſtries / 
that none coude go that waye but they were taken
priſoners / without it were the pylgrimes
that wente to ſaynt Iames / with the ayde of a
nother fortreſſe called Nemeluz. In theſe two
garyſons all the robbers and pyllers of the coū
               tre
aſſembled / And euer they were agaynſt the
erle of Foiz / and alſo agaynſt the erle of Army
nake / wherfore they cared nat / though the duke
of Aniou came in to that coūtre. And whan ſir
Garſes was come before the caſtell of Trygalet / 
he coulde nat approche on the one parte for
the ryuer / and ſo gaue a great aſſaute / & many
men hurte bothe within and without with ſhot
and fyue dayes togyder this ſir Garſes made
aſſautes / ſo that at laſte the artillary within began
to fayle them / and the frēche men ꝑceyued
it very well. Than by gentylneſſe / ſir Garſes
cauſed the capitayne to come & ſpeke with him
vnder ſaue conducte / and ſayd to hym. Baſtot
I knowe well what caſe ye be in. ye haue no artillary
within / nor nothyng to defende you fro
the ſante / but ſpeares. Knowe for trouthe / that
if ye be taken by force / I can nat ſaue your lyfe
nor none of youre company / for the cōmons of
the countre wyll ſlee you all / which I wolde be
lothe to ſe / for ye are my coſyn. Therfore I coū
               ſayle
you to yelde vp the fortreſſe: And ſythe yt
I deſyre you ſo to do / ye can beare no blame in
your ſo doyng / and departe hens wheder as ye
lyſte / for ye haue kepte this caſtell long ynough
Sir quod the ſquyer / I wolde gladly folowe
your coūſayle / if it were out of dedes of armes
for in dede I am your coſyn. But ſir / I can nat
yelde vp this fortreſſe all alone / for ſuche as be
within / haue as good parte therof as I haue / 
though they holde me for their capitayne. Sir
I ſhall go to them and ſhewe them as ye haue
ſaid / if they accorde to rendre it vp / I ſhall nat
ſay nay: and if they wyll kepe it ſtyll whatſoeuer
aduēture fall / I ſhall take ſuche parte as
they do. It is well ſaid quod ſir Garſes / deꝑte
whan ye wyll / I knowe your entent. Than the
Baſtot of Manlyon retourned to the caſtell of
Trygalet / and called all his company toguyder / 
and ther ſhewed them all the ſayeng of ſir
Garſes / and ſo demaunded of them what they
thought was beſt to do. And ſo they counſayled
toguyder a longe ſpace / ſome wolde abyde
the aduenture and ſayd / howe they were ſtronge
ynough: and ſome wolde departe and ſaid / 
howe it was a good tyme ſo to do / ſeynge that
they had no more artillary / & ſawe well howe
the duke of Aniou was cruell / and the cōmons
of Thoulous / of Carcaſſon
                  •
               y / & of other townes
there about / ſore diſpleaſed with them / for
the great domages that they had done to thē.
So all thynges conſydred / they concluded to
yelde vp the caſtell / ſo that they might be ſafely
conducted and all theirs to the caſtell Culyer / 
the whiche was kepte by ſome of their companyons / 
on the fronter of Tholouſin. So thus
the capitayne retourned agayne to the hoſt to
ſpeke with ſir Garſes / and he agreed to their
deſyres: For he ſawe well the caſtell wolde nat
lightely be wonne by aſſaute / without loſſe of
moche people. So than they prepared to departe
& truſſed all their baggage / for they had
moche pyllage / they toke with them the beſt &
lefte the reſydue. And ſit Garſes conueyed thē
to Culyer without daunger. Thus the frenche
men at that tyme gate this caſtell Trygalette.
Than ſir Garſes dyd gyue the caſtell to the cō
               mens
of the countre / and they dyd raſe it downe / 
as ye ſe: ſo that there was neuer none ſithe
that wolde reedify it agayne. And ſo fro thens
ſit Garſes wente towarde the caſtell Nantylleur / 
ſtandyng on theſe laundes nere to the caſtell
Lameu. And as he wente thyderwarde / 
one ſhewed hym yt the caſtell Nantylleur was
voyde / and they departed that kepte it. Than̄e
ſir Garſes taryed in the ſelde & deuyſed what
was beſt than to do. Than the ſeneſhall of No
beſen ſayd. ſir / this caſtell of Nantylleur is in
my bayliwyke / and it ought to parteyne to the
erle of Foiz. I praye you let me haue it / and I
ſhall make it to be ſo kepte / on my proper coſte
and charge / that no man that wyll any hurte

to the contrarye ſhall neuer entre therin. Sir
quod they of Tholous / he ſayeth well / and he
is a valyant man / it were better he had it than
another. Well quod ſir Garſes I am content.
Thus the caſtell of Nātylleur was delyuered
to the ſeneſchall of Nobeſen / who incontynent
rode thyder and founde it clene voyde. Than
he newly fortifyed that was broken / and heſet
therin a capitayne / a ſquyer of the countre called
Fortefey ſaynt Poule / & than he retourned
to the ſiege of Maluoyſen / where ye duke was
and alſo thyder was come ſir Garſes & all his
company / and ſhewed the duke all that he had
done. This ſiege endured about a .vi. wekes
and nighe euery day there was ſcrimyſſhinge
at the barryers / at laſte they withoute ſtopped
their water / ſo that their ſeſterns began to drie
and in ſixe wekes their fell nat a droppe of rayne / 
the ſeaſon was ſo drie and hote / and they wt
               out
had eaſe ynoughe by reaſon of the fayre ryuer.
Whan they wtin ſawe what caſe they were
in / they were ſore abaſſhed / for they ſawe well
they coude nat long endure. Wyne they hadde
plentie / but freſſhe water fayled them: Than̄e
they aduyſed to fall in treatie with the duke / &
ſo they dyde: And Raymonde de leſpee purchaſed
a ſaue conduct to go in to the hooſt to ſpeke
with the duke / and ſo he dyd / and ſayd. Sir / if
ye wyll be courteſſe to me and to my company / 
I ſhall render in to youre handes the caſtell of
Maluoyſen. What curteſy wolde ye quod the
duke / that I ſhulde ſhewe you? Departe your
waye / you and all yours in to your owne coū
               treis / 
and entre nat in to no fortereſſe that holdeth
agaynſt vs / for if ye do: and if I get you
or any of you / I ſhall delyuer you to Ioſelyn / 
that ſhall make your beerdes without any raſoure.
Sir quod Raymonde / if we ſhall deꝑte
ſhall we haue with vs all our bagges and baggages / 
for that we haue wonne it by armes / &
in great aduenture? Than the duke ſtudyed a
lytell and ſayd. I am content that ye bere with
you / as moche as ye may beare in males and ſomers / 
and none otherwiſe. And if ye haue any
priſoners / that ye delyuer them to vs. I am cō
               tent
ꝙ Raymonde. Thus all they within deꝑted
and yelded vp the caſtell to the duke of Anto
we: But Raymonde de leſpe tourned and be
came frenche / and ſerued the duke of Aniowe
longe tyme after / and went with him in to Italy / 
and there dyed in aſcrimyſſhe before
Naples / whan the duke of Aniou
& the duke of / Sauoy made
their voyage.
         
         
            Howe the gariſon & caſtell of Lourde
was caſt downe and diſconfyted by / 
the great dilygence that the Erle of
Foiz made. Cap. xxiiii.
            
               THus quod the knight
the duke of Aniou gatte the
caſtell of Maluoyſen / wherof
he great ioye / and made
it to be kepte by a knyght of
Bygore / called ſir Cyquart
of Luperier / & after he gaue
it to the erle of Foiz who kepeth it yet / and wyll
do as longe as he lyueth: And he hath made capitayne
there a knyght of Bygore / one of his
owne lynage / called ſir Raymon de Lane / and
whan the duke of Aniou had the poſſeſſyon of
Maluoyſen / and had delyuered his countrey
fro the Englyſſhmen / and fro the pyllers of the
conntre. Than he wente and layd ſeige before
the caſtell of Lourde. Than therle of Foiz douted
greatly the duke of Aniou / bycauſe he cam
ſo nere hym / and wyſte nat what he entended.
Than therle of Foiz aſſembled togyder knightes
and ſquyers / and ſent thē aboute to dyuers
garyſons / and ſette his Brother ſir Arnolde
Guyllame in the towne of Morlens with two
hundred ſpeares in the towne of Panne / and
ſir Peter of Cabeſton in to the cite of Leſtrade
with other two hundred ſpeares / and ſir Monant
of Nōnalles went in to the towne of Hart
let with a hundred ſpeares / and Arnolde Gehe
rell in to the towne of Montgeberell with a hū
               dred
ſpeares / ſit Foulquant Dortery in to the
towne of Sanetere with a hundred ſpeares / &
I Eſpaygne of Lyon was ſente to the Mount
Marſon with two hundred ſpeares. There
was no caſtell in all Bierne / but that was well
prouyded with men of warre / and the erle himſelfe
laye ſtyll at his Caſtell of Ortayſe by his
florens. Why ſir quod I / hath he ſo great plentie
of florens? ſir quod he at this houre / I thynke
he hath well to the nōbre of .xxx. tymes a hundred
thouſande. There is no lorde lyuenge as
now / that is ſo large and lyberall in gyueng of
gyftes / as he is. Than I demaunded of hym
to what maner of people he was ſo lyberall / he
anſwered and ſaid / to ſtraungers / to knightes
and ſquyers comyng through his countre / and
to haraldes and mynſtrels / and to euery man
that ſpeketh with hym / there is none departeth
fro him without ſome reward / for if any refuſe
his gyfte he is nat content. A ſaynt mary ſir ꝙ

I / to what entent kepeth he ſo moche money / &
wher dothe he get it. Is his renenues ſo great
to gader toguyder ſuche treaſure? ſir / I wolde
gladly knowe this / if it pleaſed you. Well ſir ꝙ
the knight ye ſhall know it / but ye haue demaū
               ded
of metwo thynges. Firſt ye haue demaū

I ſhall ſhewe you. Therle of Foiz alway
douteth of the warre that he had with therle of
Arminake / & alſo for the buſyneſſe of his neighbours / 
the frenche kyng and the kynge of Englande / 
whom he wolde nat wyllingly diſpleaſe:
For he hath alwayes diſſymuled bytwene
them / duryng all the wary ſeaſon vnto this preſent
tyme / for he neuer armed hym ſelfe for any
of their parties / He hath alwayes been euer in
good caſe with bothe parties I ſaye to you: &
ſo ye ſhall ſaye youreſelfe whan̄e ye haue ones
knowlege of hym and herde him ſpeke / & ones
knowe the order and ſtate of his houſe / ye ſhall
ſe that he is at this daye / the mooſt ſage prince
in the worlde. And there is none ſo great a lorde / 
nother the frenche kyng nor the kyng of Englande / 
yt wyll wyllingly haue his yuell wyll:
as for his other neighbours / as the kyng of Arragon
or the kyng of Nauer / he eſtemeth them
but lytell / for he wyll fynde mo men of armes
(by reaſon of ſuche frendes as he hath gote wt
his giftes / and money that he hath in treaſure)
than bothe thoſe kynges can do: For I haue
herde hym ſaye / that whan the kyng of Cyper
was in his countre of Byerne / and moued him
to haue gone to the voiage of the holy Sepulture.
He hadde thought the ſame tyme to haue
made ſuche a iourney / that if the frenche kyng
or the kyng of Englande had taken that enterpriſe
/ howe ther ſhulde haue ben no lorde ſhulde
haue brought ſuche a company as he wolde
haue done / and as yet he is of the ſame mynde:
and in parte / that is one of the cauſes that he
gadereth ſuche treaſure.
            tHe prince of Wales / the ſeaſon that he
raigned in the countre of Acquitayne
beyng at Burdeux on the ryuer of Geronde / 
thought to haue made hym warre. The
prince manaſſyde him for the coūtre of Bierne
and wolde haue had hym to haue holde his coū
               tre
of hym / and the erle ſayd he wolde nat: and
ſayd / howe his countre of Bierne was ſo free a
lande / that it ought to do homage to no man of
the worlde. And the prince / who at that tyme
was great and ſore feared / ſaid howe he wolde
compell hym ꝑforce / for therle of Armynake &
the lorde Dalbret who loued nat therle of Foiz
bycauſe of ſuche victories as he hadde won on
them before. They tytled the prince euer in his
eare / and entyſed hym to haue made warre agaynſt
the erle of Foiz / but the voiage that the
prince made in to Spayne brake his purpoſe.
Alſo ſir Iohn̄ Chandos / who was chefe of coū
               ſayle
with the Prince was agaynſt it / that the
prince ſhulde make any watre to the erle. The
erle of Foiz loued right well ſir Iohan Chandos
and he hym / but the erle douted the prince / 
bycauſe he was fierſe and coragious. and therfore
he gadered togyder as moche treaſure as
he coude gette / to thentent therwith to defende
hym if nede were. And ſo he ſet great tayles &
taxes in all his coūtre and in euery towne / whiche
as yet endureth / and ſhall do as long as he
lyueth. He had of euery fyre euery yere two frā
               kes / 
and the ryche to beare out the poore / therby
he gadered and yet dothe great riches / and
the people payeth it with a marueylous good
wyll. For by reaſon therof / there is nother Englyſſhe
nor frenche / nor robbers nor reyuers / yt
dothe them any hurte / to the value of one pēny.
And ſo his countre is in ſauegarde and iuſtice
truely kepte / for in doyng of iuſtyce he is right
cruell: he is the mooſt rightfull lorde yt is nowe
lyueng. And ſo with theſe wordes we came to
the towne of Turney / where as we ſhulde reſt
all night. So than the knight ſeaſed of his talkyng / 
and I remembred well where we lefte agaynſt
the next day / and we were lodged at the
ſigne of the Starre and toke our eaſe. And at
ſupper tyme the capitayne of Maluoyſin / called
ſir Raymonde of Lane / came to ſe vs & ſupped
with vs / and brought with hym four flaggons
of the beſt wyne that I drāke of in all my
iourney: thoſe two knightes talked long togider:
and whan it was late the knight departed
and retourned to the caſtell of Maluoyſin. and
the next mornyng we mounted on out horſes / 
and departed fro Tourney & paſſed by a gyde
the ryuer of Lyſſe / and rode towarde the cytie
of Tarbe / & entred in to Bigore: And we lefte
the waye to Lourde / to Bagueres / and to the
caſtell of Mountgaylliard on the lyfte hande.
And we rode towarde a vyllage called Teracimytat / 
and dyd cooſt it / and came to a wode
in the lande of the lorde of Barbaſan / and we
came nere to a caſtell called Matheras / at the
entre of the countre of Layre. Than the knight
ſaid to me. Sir Iohan / beholde here the place
of Layre / and beholde it well & aduyſe the coū
               tre / 
which ſemed to me right ſtrāge / I thought

my ſelfe but as loſt ther / if I had nat ben in the
company with that knight. Than I remēbred
the wordes that this knight had ſhewed me .ii.
or thre dayes before of that countre of Layre / 
and of the Mēgeant of Lourde. Than I ſayd
to hym. Sir / ye ſhewed me the laſt daye / that
whan we ſhulde be in the coūtre of Layre / that
ye wolde ſhewe me the maner of the Mēgeant
of Lourde / and howe he dyed. It is true ſir ꝙ
the knyght / come on & ryde by me and I ſhall
ſhewe you. Than I rode nere hym to here his
wordes / and than he ſayde. Sir / in the ſeaſon
that Peter Danchyne helde the caſtell and caſtell
of Ortyngas / as I haue ſhewed you before
this tyme. They of the gariſon of Lourde
ſōtyme rode forthe at aduenture farre fro their
garyſon / howe be it they had nat alwayes the
aduauntage / for ye maye beholde here the caſtell
of Barbaſon and the Caſtell of Martheras / 
wherin there was alwayes many men of
warre there / and in other garyſons / as Bagueces / 
Tourney / Mountgalyarde / Salenges / 
Benache / Gorre / and Tarbe / all frenche townes
and garyſons. And whan theſe garyſons
knewe that they of Lourde rode outher towardes
Tholous or Carcaſſone: Thā they wolde
laye buſſhementes for them / and ſomtyme take
fro them of Lourde their praye and pyllage / &
ſomtyme they ſcaped without any rencounter.
And on a tyme it fortuned / that Eruaulton of
ſaynt Colombe and the Mengeant of ſaynte
Cornyle / and to the nombre of ſixſcore ſpeares
of good men of warre departed fro Lourde / about
the moūtayns / bytwene theſe two ryuers
Lyſſe and Leſſe / and ſo rode nere to Tholous / 
and at their retournyng they founde in the medowes
a great nombre of beeſtes / oxen & keen / 
hogges / mottons / and lambes: and alſo they
toke dyuers of the good men of the countre priſoners / 
and ſo droue all their pray before them.
Than it was ſhewed to the capitayne of Tarbe
a ſquyer of Gaſcoyne / called Erualton Byſette / 
an experte man of armes / Howe they of
the garyſon of Lourde were abrode / and were
comyng homewarde with a great praye: than
he ſente to the lorde of Benache and to Engueroſe
/ eldeſt ſonne to ſir Raymonde / and alſo to
the lorde of Barbaſon / Certifyeng them howe
he wolde ryde out agaynſt theym of Lourde.
The knyghtes and ſquyers of the countrey of
Bigore agreed to ryde forthe / and aſſembled to
guyder at Tourney / and with them ther was
the Bourcke of Spaygne / who came fro his
garyſon of ſaynt Bearte. So they were to the
nombre of two hundred ſpeares / and they had
their ſpyes abrode in the Countrey / to knowe
what they of Lourde dyde. On the other ſyde / 
they of Lourd had abrode their ſpies to knowe
if any men of warre were abrode to lette them
of their enterpriſe. And ſo moche dyde theſe yt
eyther partie knewe what other dyde. Whan̄e
they of Lourde knewe howe they of the frenche
garyſons were abrode and taryed for them at
Tourney / Than they were in doute / and toke
coūſayle what they might beſt do / to ſaue their
pray. Than they determyned to departe their
company in two. The one company to driue
before them their praye with all their varlettꝭ / 
and to go couertly by the lane of Bourge / and
ſo to paſſe the waye by the bridge of Tourney
and to paſſe the ryuer of Leſſe / bytwene Tourney
and Lymoſyn. And the other company to
ryde in batayle by the mountayns / and to make
ſhewe to go agayne in to the countre of Layre
by Martheras / & ſo to fall in bytwene Barbaſon
and Mountgalyarde: And ſayd / that if
they mete toguyder about Mountgaylliarde / 
than they ſhulde be in ſauegarde / for than we
ſhall be ſoone at Lourde. Thus as they ordayned
ſo they dyde. And the baſtarde of Caruyllacke / 
Guyllonet of Harmyes / and Perot Burcyer / 
Iohn̄ Calleuyn of Baſile / the reed ſquier
and fourtie ſpeares with all their varlettꝭ with
all their pray / toke the waye by the lane of Burge / 
& ſo to paſſe the ryuer at the bridge bitwene
Tourney and Maluoyſin / thynkynge to mete
all togyder bytwene Eynitat and Moūtgaylyarde:
and ſo they departed / and the other cō
               pany
as Erualton of Reſtue / Erualton of ſaīt
Colombe / and the Mēgeant of ſaynt Coruyle
with fourſcore men of armes / there was nat .x.
varlettes among them. So they made thē ſelf
redy and rode cloſe toguyder / euer lokyng for
their enemyes: For they knewe well they were
abrode to watche for them. In lyke maner as
they of Lourde had taken their aduiſe and coū
               ſayle
howe to retourne / in lykewiſe the frenche
men tooke counſayle howe they might encounter
their enemyes / and ſir Monant of Barbaſan
and Erualton Byſſet / ſayd to their companye.
Sirs / we knowe well howe they of Lourde
are abrode in the feldes / and driueth before
them great praye and many priſoners. It ſhulde
be a great dyſpleaſure to vs / if they ſhulde
ſcape: Therfore lette vs put our ſelfe in to two
buſſhementes / we are company ynough ſo to
do. Than it was ordayned that Erualton and
the Bourge of Spayne / ſir Raymonde of Benache

and Anguerot Lane with a hundred ſperes / 
ſhulde kepe the paſſage at Tourney: For
they knewe well that they of Lourd with their
praye muſt nedes paſſe the ryuer of Lyſſe. and
it was ordayned / that the lorde of Barbaſone
and Erualton Byſet with a hundred ſpeares / 
ſhulde ryde at aduentures. So this they deꝑted / 
and the lorde of Benache and the Bourge
of Spaygne put them ſelfe in a buſſhment / bytwene
Maluoyſin and Turney / and the other
company rode and toke the ſame waye that we
be nowe in / which is called the Layre / and here
they mette with thē of Lourde. And whan eche
of them ſawe other / they a lyghted and made
them redy to fyght / And ſo came eche agaynſt
other cryeng their cryes / ſaynt George Lourd
and the other our lady of Bigore. and ſo there
eche came to other with hande ſtrokes / foyninge
with their ſpeares eche at other a great ſpace / 
and as I herde reported of them that were
ther / at the firſt brunt there was none ouerthrowen.
And ſo whan eche of thē had a great ſpace
foyned eche at other / they caſte downe their
ſpeares and toke their axes and gaue therwith
eche to other great and horrible ſtrokes / euery
man with his matche / and in that maner they
fought toguyder more than two houres: And
whan any of them had fought ſo long that they
lacked brethe / than they wolde fayre and eaſely
departe / and go ſytte downe by a dyke ſyde
that was full of water / and put of their baſſenettes
and refreſſhe them ſelfe. And whan they
were well refreſſhed / they putte on their baſſenetes
and retourned agayne to fight. I beleue
there was nat ſuche a buſyneſſe nor a batayle
ſo well fought (ſithe the batayle yt was in Bretayne
of .xxx. agaynſt as many) As this was
here at Martheras in Bigore. Thus they
fought hande to hande / and Erualton of ſaynt
Colombe was at the poynt to haue ben diſconfyted
by aſquyer of the countre called Guyllonet
of Salynges. This Erualton of ſaint Colombe
had a varlet / who ſtode by and ſawe the
batayle and fought nat / for ther was none that
ſayd any thyng to hym. And whan he ſawe his
maiſter almoſt at vttraunce he was ſorie / and
ſo came to his maiſter and tooke his axe out of
his handes and ſayd. Erualton / go your waye
and reſt you / ye can no lengar fight. And than
he with the axe wente to the ſquyer & gaue him
ſuche a ſtroke on the heed that he was aſtonied
and had nere hande fallen to the erthe. Whan̄e
Guyllonet felte hym ſelfe ſtryken he was ſore
diſpleaſed / and came agaynſt the varlet to haue
ſtryken hym / but the varlet ſtepte vnder the
ſtroke and enbraſed the ſquyer / who was ſore
traueyled with ſo long fightyng / & ſo the varlet
ouerthrewe hym wreſtlyng vnder hym. thā
the varlet ſayde. I ſhall ſlee the / without thou
wylte yelde thy ſelfe to my maiſter. Who is thy
mayſter quod the ſquyer? Erualton of ſaynt
Colombe quod the varlette / with whome thou
haſte fought all this ſeaſon. The ſquyer ſawe
that he had nat the vauntage / but that he was
vnder the varlette / who had a daggar redy to
ſtryke hym. So he yelded hym to rendre his
body priſoner at Lourde within fyftene dayes
after / reſcues or no reſcues. This ſeruyce dyd
this varlet to his maiſter. And ſir Iohn̄ / I aſſure
you / ther were many feates of armes done
and many ouerthrowen and taken priſoners / 
ſome to yelde them ſelfe in a certayne ſpace at
Tarbe / and ſome to come to Lourde. They
fought this day hande to hande / Erualton By
ſet with the Mengeant of ſaynt Baſyll / they
dyde many a feate of armes bytwene thē: and
they fought ſo long till they were ſo wery / that
they coude ayde them ſelfe no lengar. and ther
was ſlayne on the place two capitayns / the mē
geant of Lourde / and on the other parte Erualton
Byſſet. Than ceaſed the batayle by agrement
of bothe parties / for they were ſo wery / 
that they coude ſcante holde their axes in their
handes. Some vnarmed them to refreſſhe thē
ſelfe / and lefte their armure in the place. They
of Lourde bare awaye with them the Mengeant
ſlayne / and the frenche men bare Erualton
Byſſet to Tarbe. And to thentent that this batayle
ſhulde be had in remembraunce wher as
the two ſquyers fought / there was ſet a Croſſe
of ſtone / beholde yonder is the Croſſe. & with
thoſe wordes we came to the Croſſe / and there
we ſayd for their ſoules a Pater noſter and an
Aue maria. By my faythe ſir quod I / I am
gladde I haue herde this / for this was a ſharpe
buſyneſſe of ſo lytell people. But ſir / what
became of them that wente with the praye? I
ſhall ſhewe you quod he. They came to the ꝑte
of Tourney beſyde Maluoyſin / to haue paſſed
there as they had ordayned / And ther they
founde the buſſhment of the Bourge of Spaygne / 
who brake out of their buſſhment / & they
of Lourde coude nat recule backe / they had no
remedy / but to aduēture their ſelfe. And I tell
you trouthe / there was as ſore a fight and as
long endured or lengar / than that at Martheras:

and there Erualton of Spayne dyde marueylous
in armes / He had an axe in his hande / 
who ſoeuer he ſtrake therwith went to the erth
for he was bygge and well made / and nat ouer
charged with moche fleſſhe. He toke ther with
his owne handes the two capitayns / the Burge
of Coruyle and Perot Palatyne of Bierne
and there was ſlayne a ſquier of Nauar called
Ferādo of Myrando / who was an expert man
of armes. ſome that were at the buſyneſſe ſayd
that the Bourge of Spaygne ſlewe hym / and
ſome ſayd he was ouercome for heat in his harneſſe.
Finally the praye was reſcewed / and all
taken or ſlayne that wente therwith / ther were
but thre ſaued them ſelfe / and they were varlettes
                  •
               
who departed and wente ouer the ryuer of
Lyſſe. Thus became of this aduenture: They
of Lourde neuer loſte before ſo moche as they
dyde than: They were courteſly raunſomed / 
and dyuers delyuered by exchaunge one for a
nother / For dyuers of them that fought here at
the place of Layre / were taken by thē of Lourd
Therfore euery parte were courteyſe one to another / 
in raunſomyng of their companyons.
Ah ſaynt Mary ſir quod I / is the Bourge of
Spaygne ſo bygge a man as ye ſpeke of? yea
ſir truely quod he / for in all Gaſcoyne there is
none lyke hym in ſtrength of body / therfore the
erle of Foiz hath hym euer in his company. It
paſte nat a thre yere that he dyde in a ſporte a
great dede / as I ſhall ſhewe you.
            So it was on a Chriſtmas day / the Erle of
Foiz helde a great feeſt and a plentifull of knightes
and ſquyers / as it is his vſage: And it
was a colde day / and the erle dyned in the hall / 
and with hym great company of lordes. And
after dyner he deꝑted out of the hall and wente
vp in to a galarye of .xxiiii. ſtayres of heyght / 
in whiche galarye ther was a great Chymney
wherin they made fyre / whan therle was ther.
and at that tyme there was but a ſmall fyre / for
the erle loued no great fyre / how be it he hadde
woode ynoughe there about / and in Bierne is
wode ynoughe. The ſame daye it was a great
froſt and very colde: And whan the erle was in
the galarye and ſawe the fyre ſo lytell / he ſayde
to the knightes and ſquiers about hym. Sirs
this is but a ſmall fyre / & the day ſo colde: than
Erualton of Spayne went downe the ſtayres
and beneth in the courte he ſawe a great meny
of Aſſes laden with woode to ſerue the houſe / 
Than he wente and toke one of the gretteſt Aſſes
with all the Woode and layde hym on his
backe / and went vp all the ſtayres in to the galary / 
and dyde caſt downe the Aſſe with all the
woode in to the chymney / and the Aſſes fete vpwarde
/ Wherof the erle of Foiz had great ioye
and ſo hadde all they that were there / and had
marueyle of his ſtrength / howe he alone came
vp all the ſtayres with the Aſſe and the woode
in his necke. I toke great pleaſure in this tale
and in other that this knyght ſir Eſpaygne de
Leon ſhewed me / wherby I thought my iourney
moche the ſhorter. And in ſhewyng of theſe
maters / we paſſed the paſe of Layre and the caſtell
of Martheras / where as the batayle was / 
and ſo we rode nere to the caſtell of Barbaſon / 
whiche is ſtronge & fayre / and is within a leage
of Tarbe / whiche we ſawe before vs / and a
fayre waye coſtyng the ryuer of Lyſſe comyng
fro the mountayns. Than we rode fayre and
eaſely at our leyſar to refreſſhe our horſes. and
there he ſhewed me the ryuer / the caſtell / & the
towne of Mountgalyarde / and the waye that
laye to Lourde. Than̄e it came to my remembraunce
to demaunde the knight / howe the duke
of Aniou whan he was in the countrey / and
that the caſtell of Maluoyſin was yelded to hī / 
came before Lourde / and what he dyd there. &
with right a good wyll he ſhewed me and ſaid.
Whanne the duke of Aniowe departed frome
Maluoyſin withall his hoſt / he paſſed ouer the
ryuer of Lyſſe at the bridge of Tourney / and
wente and lodged at Baguiers / where as is a
good ryuer goynge to Tarbe / for this ryuer of
Tourney cometh nat thyder / but falleth in to
the ryuer of Garon beſyde Moūtunllyon / and
ſo the duke went and layd ſiege to Lourde. ſir
Peter Erualton of Bierne and Iohan his brother / 
Peter Danchyn / Erualton of Reſtue / Erualton
of ſaynt Colombe / and the Mengeant / 
who as than was lyueng / and Ferando of Myrando
with Olyuer Barbe / the Burge of Coruyllacke / 
and the Burge Canuſe / and certayne
other cōpanions beyng within Lourde. Whan
they were well enfourmed of the dukes comynge
thyder / they fortifyed them and their garyſon
agaynſt hym / & helde the towne of Lourde
for all the ſautes that the duke made / Whiche
fyftene dayes contynually endured / and there
were many feates of armes done. The duke ordayned
many Inſtrumentes of warre for the
ſaute / ſo that finally the towne was wonne / but
they loſte neyther man / woman / nor good: for
they were all withdrawen in to the caſtell / For

they knewe well at length the towne wolde nat
holde / for it was cloſed but with dykes and pales.
Whan the towne of Lourde was won the
Frenche men had great ioye / and ſo lodged in
the towne roūde about the caſtell / whiche was
nat prignable without it were with long ſiege
There the duke taryed more than ſixe wekes / 
and loſt more than he wanne / for they without
coulde do no hurte to them within / for the Caſtell
ſtandeth on a rounde rocke / made in ſuche
maner / that no man coude aproche it by ſcalynge
nor other wyſe / but by one entre: And there
at the barryers were many ſcrimyſſhes & many
feates of armes done / and dyuers knightes
and ſquyers of Fraunce were hurte / ſuche as
wolde preſe to nere. Whan the duke ſawe howe
he coude nat haue his entent to gette the caſtell
of Lourde / than he fell in treatie with the capitayne
within / and offred him moche money to
gyue vp the garyſon. The knight who was of
great valyanteſſe excuſed hymſelfe and ſaid.
Howe the garyſon was nat his / but it parteyned
to the herytage of the kynge of Englande / 
and ſayd: Howe he coude nat ſell it nor gyue it
nor putte it awaye / without he ſhulde be a tray
tour / whiche in no wyſe he wolde be / but trewe
to his naturall lorde durynge his lyfe: & moreouer
ſayd / that whan the caſtell was delyuered
hym / it was on a condycion / whiche he ſware
ſolempnely by his faythe in the prince of Wales
hande / yt he ſhulde kepe the caſtell of Lourde
agaynſt all men durynge his lyfe / excepte it
were agaynſt the kyng of Englande. The duke
coude neuer haue other anſwere of hym / for
gyfte nor promyſe that he coulde make. And
whan the duke of Aniou and his coūſaile ſawe
howe they coude haue nothynge els / and ſawe
that they loſte their payne / they diſlodged / and
at their departynge they clene brent the towne.
Than the duke of Aniowe drewe backe in cooſtynge
Bierne / and rode towarde the Mount
Marſen / and had knowledge howe the erle of
Foiz had fortifyed all his garyſons with men
of warre / wherof he was nothyng dyſcontent / 
but he was diſpleaſed / in that the knyghtꝭ and
ſquyers of Bierne helde Lourde agaynſt hym
The erle of Foyz (as I haue ſhewed you here
before) doughted greatly the duke of Aniowe / 
thoughe the duke dyde hym no hurte: But the
erle of Arminake and the lorde Dalbret wolde
haue had the Duke to haue made hym warre / 
but the duke had no wyll there to: But whyle
he lodged bytwene Mounte Marſen and the
Boce Dalbret / he ſent to the erle to Ortaiſe ſir
Peter of Beule / whom the erle receyued honorably
and lodged hym in the caſtell of Ortaiſe / 
and made hym as good chere as he coude / and
gaue hym mulettes and courſers / & to his men
great gyftes. And he ſente by hym to the duke
of Aniowe foure courſers and two Allans of
Spaygne / fayre and good. And there were ſecrete
treaties bytwene the erle and this ſir Peter
of Beule: of whiche treaties no man knewe
the entent therof of a good ſpace after. But after
by ſuche euydent tokens as appered we ſuppoſed
ſomewhat / and the mater I ſhall ſhewe
you / and by that tyme we ſhall come to Tarbe.
            ANone after that the duke of Aniou had
made his voyage / and that he was at
Tholous / Than the erle of Foiz ſende by his
letters / certayne meſſangers to Lourde to his
coſyn ſir Peter Erualton of Bierne / deſyring
hym to come and ſpeke with hym at Ortayſe.
And whan the knyght had reed therles letters / 
and ſawe his notable meſſage / he had dyuers
ymaginacions / and wyſt nat wheder he might
go or abyde. All thynges conſydred / he ſayd he
wolde go / bycauſe in no wyſe he wolde diſpleaſe
the erle. And whan he departed fro Lourde / 
he ſayd to Iohan of Bierne his brother / in the
preſens of all the companyons of the garyſon.
Brother Iohan / the erle of Foyz hath ſente for
me / I can nat tell you why / But ſythe it is his
pleaſure to ſpeke with me I wyll go to hym. I
feare me greatly that I ſhalbe requyred to gyue
vp this fortreſſe of Lourde: For the duke of
Aniou whan he was in the countrey he coſted
Bierne / and entred nat therin. And the erle of
Foyz hath longe entended to haue the caſtell of
Maluoyſin / to the entent to be lorde of the lanede
Bourge / and of the fronters of Comynges
and of Bigore. I knowe nat what treatie ther
is made / bytwene hym and the duke of Aniou / 
But one thynge I ſaye playnly: as longe as I
lyue / I ſhall neuer yelde vp the garyſon / but to
myne owne naturall lorde the kyng of Englā
               de.
Wherfore brother Iohan / in caſe that I ſtablyſſhe
you in myne abſence to be Capitayne
here / that ye ſhall ſwere to me by the faythe of
your gentylneſſe / that ye ſhall kepe this caſtell / 
in lyke maner and fourme as I do / and that for
lyfe or dethe ye fayle nat. And Iohan of byerne
ſware to fulfyll his deſyre: Than ſir Peter Erualton
wente to Ortayſe and a lyghted at the
ſigne of the Moone / And whan he thought it

was tyme / he wente to the caſtell of Ortayſe to
therle / who with great ioye receyued hym and
made hym ſyt at his borde / and ſhewed him as
great ſemblant of loue as he coude. And after
dyner he ſaid. Coſyn Peter / I haue to ſpeke wt
you of dyuers thyngꝭ / wherfore I wyll that ye
departe nat without my leaue. The knight an
ſwered and ſayd. ſir / I ſhall nat departe tyll it
be your pleaſur. Than the thirde day after the
erle of Foiz ſaid vnto hym / in the preſens of the
vycount of Gouſſerant his brother / and before
the lorde Dāchyn of Bigore / and dyuers other
knightes and ſquyers. The erle ſayd a loude yt
euery man might here hym: Peter I ſende for
you and ye become. I wyll ye knowe / the duke
of Aniou wolde me moche yuell bycauſe of the
gariſon of Lourde / whiche ye kepe: for the whiche
cauſe my lande was nere hāde ouerron and
good frendes had nat been. And it is his opynion
and dyuers other of his company / that he
hateth me / bicauſe (as they ſay) howe I maynteyne
& ſuſtayne yon / bycauſe ye be of Byerne:
And it is nat mete for me to haue the yuell wyll
of ſo great a prince / as the duke of Aniowe is.
Wherfore I cōmaunde you as ye wyll eſchewe
my diſpleaſure / and by the faythe and lignage
that ye owe to me / that ye yelde vp the garyſon
of Lourde in to my handes. Whan the knyght
herde theſe wordes he was ſore abaſſhed / & ſtudyed
a lytell / remembringe what aunſwere he
might make / for he ſawe well the Erle ſpake in
good faithe. Howe be it all thynges conſydred
he ſayd. Sir / true it is I owne to you faythe &
homage / for I am a poore knyght of yo
                  •
                blode
and of your countrey: But as for the caſtell of
Lourde / I wyll nat delyuer it to you / ye haue
ſent for me / do with me as ye lyſt. I holde it of
the kyng of Englande he ſette me there / and to
none other lyueng wyll I delyuer it. Whan the
erle of Foyz herde that anſwere his blode chafed
for yre / and ſayd drawyng out his daggar:
A treatour / ſayeſt thou nay? By my heed thou
haſt nat ſayd that for nought: and ſo therwith
ſtrake the knight that he wounded hym in fyue
places / and there was no knyght nor barone yt
durſt ſteppe bytwene them: Than the knyght
ſayd. Ah ſit / ye do me no gentylneſſe / to ſende
for me and ſlee me. And yet for all the ſtrokes
that he had with the daggar / therle cōmaūded
to caſt him in priſon downe in to a depe dyke / &
ſo he was and ther dyed / for his woundꝭ were
but yuell loked vnto. Ah ſaynt Mary quod I
to the knyght / Was nat this a great crueltie?
Whatſoeuer it was ꝙ the knyght thus it was.
Lette one aduyſe hym well or he diſpleaſe him / 
for and he be angry there is no pardon. He helde
ones his coſyn germayne the vicoūt of Chateau
Bein / who is his heryter eight monethes
in the towre of Ortaiſe in priſon / and after raū
               ſomed
him at fourtie thouſande frankes. Why
ſir quod I / hath the erle of Foyz no chyldren?
No truely ſir quod he by any wyfe / but he hath
two yonge knightes yt be his baſtardes / whom
ye ſhall ſe / and he loueth them as well as hym
ſelfe / they be called ſir Iohan and ſir Gracyen / 
Than I demaunded yf euer he were maryed.
yea truely quod he / and is yet / but his wyfe is
nat with hym. Why ſir wher is ſhe? Sir quod
he ſhe is in Nauar / for the kyng there is her coſyn / 
ſhe was doughter to kynge Loyes of Nauar.
yet than I demaunded if euer the erle had
any chyldren. yes ſir ꝙ he / he had a fayre ſonne
who had the fathers harte / and all the countrey
loued hym / for by hym all the countre of Biern
was in reſt and peace / where as it hath ben ſith
in debate and ſtryfe / for he had maryed the ſuſter
of therle of Armynake. Sir quod I / what
became of that ſonne / and it maye be knowen?
Sir ꝙ he I ſhall ſhewe you / but nat as nowe / 
for the mater is ouer longe / and we are nere the
towne / as ye ſe. Therwith I left the knight in
peace and ſo we came to Tarbe / and toke oure
lodgynge at the Starre / and there taryed all
that day / for it was a towne of great eaſement / 
bothe for man and horſe / with good hay & otes
and a fayre ryuer.
            THe nexte day after maſſe we mounted a
horſbacke / and departed fro Tarbe / &
came to a towne called Iorre / whiche valyantlye
alwayes helde agaynſt them of Lourde: &
ſo we paſſed by the towne withoute / and than
entred in to the countrey of Bierne. Than the
knight ſtode ſtyll and ſayd. Sir / beholde here
is Bierne / and we ſtode in a croſſe waye: The
knight aduyſed bym whiche waye to take / outher
to Morlens or to Panne. At laſte we toke
the way to Morlens / ridynge ouer the laūdes
of Bierne / whiche were right playne. Thafie
I demaunded of hym / if the towne of Panne
were nere vs / and he ſayde yes: and ſo he ſhewed
me the ſteple. Howe be it the diſtaūce was
farther of than it ſemed / for it was anyuel way
to ryde bycauſe of the myres / to thē that knewe
nat the countre / and nat farre thens was the caſtell
of Lourde: and I demaunded who was

as than capitayne there / He ſayd. that as than
the ſeneſchall of Bigore was capitayne there / 
admytted by the kynge of Englande / brother
to 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Peter of Bierne (as ye haue herde before)
That is trewe ſir quod I: But dyde he neuer
after go to ſe the erle of Foiz / He anſwered and
ſayd. Sithe the dethe of his brother he neuer
came there / but other of his company hath ben
often with the erle / as Peter Dauchyn / Erualton
of Reſtue / Erualton of ſaynt Colome / and
other. Sir quod I / hath the erle of Foiz made
any amendes for the dethe of that knight / or ſorie
for his dethe? yes truely ſir quod he / he was
right ſorie for his dethe / but as for amendes I
knowe of none / without it be by ſecrete penaū
               ce
/ maſſes / or prayers: He hathe with hym the
ſame knightes ſonne called Iohan of Byerne
a gracyous ſquyer / & the erle loueth hym right
well. Ah ſir quod I / the duke of Aniowe who
that wolde ſo fayne haue the caſtell of Lourde / 
ought to be well content with the erle of Foyz / 
whan he ſlewe ſuche a knight his owne coſyn / 
for to accomplyſſhe his deſyre. By my faythe
ſir quod he / ſo he was: For anone after that the
duke came to the Frenche kyng / the kynge ſent
in to this countre ſir Roger of Spaygne / and
a preſydent of the parlyament chambre of Parys / 
and letters ſealed / makyng mencion howe
the kynge dyde gyue to the erle of Foiz the coū
               tie
of Bygore / duryng his lyfe / to holde ye ſame
of the crowne of Fraunce. The Erle thanked
greatly the kyng / for the great loue that he ſhewed
him / and for that great gyfte / without any
requeſt makynge. But for all that the ſayd ſir
Roger of Spaygne coude do
                  •
                ſaye / or ſhewe / 
the erle in no wyſe wolde take the gyfte / but he
toke the caſtell of Maluoyſin / bycauſe it was a
fre lande: For that caſtell and the purteynaūce
holdeth of no man / but of God: and alſo auncyently
it parteyneth to his enherytaunce. The
frenche kyng by the meanes of the duke of Aniowe / 
dyd gyue it hym: And the erle ſware and
ꝓmyſed to take it on a condycion / that he ſhuld
neuer ſette man there that ſhulde do any yuell
to the realme of Fraunce: and ſo he dyde / For
ſuche as were ther feared as moche thengliſſhe
men / as any other Frenche garyſons in
Gaſcoyne / but the Bernoyſe
durſt nat tonne in to
the countre of
Foyz.

                  •
                & ſo we rode the ſayd mornyng to Morlens
but are we came there I ſaid. ſir / I haue forget
to demaūde of you / whan ye ſhewed me the aduentures
of Foiz / dyde diſſymule with the duke
of Berrey / who had to wyues / the doughter
and ſuſter of therle of Armynake / and wheder
that the duke of Berry made him any warre / &
howe he dyd: Howe he dyd quod the knight I
ſhall ſhewe you. In tyme paſt the duke of Berrey
wolde him as moche yuell as he coude ymagyn
/ but as nowe / by meanes whiche ye ſhall
hereof whan ye come to Ortaiſe / they be accorded.
Why ſir ꝙ I / was there any cauſe why the
duke ſhulde be diſpleaſed with hym? As helpe
me god ꝙ the knight non / but I ſhal ſhewe you
the cauſe. Whan Charles the frenche kyng / father
to kyng Charles that nowe is was dyſſeſſed
/ the realme of Fraūce was deuyded in two
partes / as in the gouernyng therof. For the duke
of Aniou who entended to go in to Italy as
he dyd / he gaue vs the rule: & than his two bretherne
the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne
had ye rule. The duke of Berry had the
gouernynge of Languedocke / and the duke of
Burgoyne ruled Languedoyle and Picardy.
Whan they of Languedocke vnderſtode yt the
duke of Berry had the gouernyng ouer them / 
they were ſore abaſſhed / and ſpecially they of
Tholous / for they knewe well that ye duke was
a ſore taker of golde and ſyluer / and a ſore oppreſſar
of the people. Alſo ther was in Carcaſſone
and in Rouergue / bretons and tholouſins
whiche the duke of Aniou had left in the coūtre
and they robbed & pylled: & the brute ran / yt the
duke of Berry maynteyned them / to thētent to
ouer maiſter ye good townes. but in this ſeaſon
that I ſpeke of / the duke of Berrey was nat in
the coūtre there / he was with the kyng in Flaū
               ders.
They of Tholous who be great and puiſſant / 

parceyued howe the frenche kyng was
yonge / and was greatly buſyed in Flaunders / 
for the ayde of his vncle the duke of Burgoyn.
And they ſawe well howe they were dayly robbed
and pilled by the britons and other / ſo that
they wyſte nat what to do. Than they ſent and
treated with the erle of Foiz / deſyring hym for
a certayne ſōme of money that they offred hym
euery moneth to be payed / that he wolde take
on him the gouernynge of Tholous / and of the
coūtre of Tholouſin: and alſo he was deſyred
of other townes in lykewiſe. they deſyred hym
bycauſe they knewe hym for a iuſte man and a
rightwyſe in iuſtyce / redouted of his enemyes / 
and fortunate in all his buſineſſe / and alſo they
of Tholous loued hym / for he had been euer to
them a good neyghbour. Thus he toke on him
the charge and the gouernynge / and ſware to
maynteyne and kepe the countre in their ryght
agaynſt all men that wolde do any wrong therto
/ reſeruyng all onely the frenche kynges perſone.
Than he ſette men of warr to watche the
wayes and paſſages / where as theſe robbers &
pyllars vſed to paſſe / & on a daye he toke / ſlewe
and drowned of them at Robeſton in Tholouſin
mo than four hūdred / wherby he gate great
grace and honoure of them of Tholous and of
Carcaſſone of Beſyers / and Mountpellyer / 
and of other good townes there about / ſo that
the renome ran in Fraunce / howe they of Languedoke
were tourned / and had taken to their
lorde the erle of Foyz. And the duke of Berry
who was ſouerayne there / toke therat great diſpleaſure:
and had therle of Foiz in great hate / 
bycauſe he medled ſo farre in the buſyneſſe of
Fraunce / and wherby he maynteyned them of
Tholous / ſtyll in their rebellyon agaynſt him.
Than he ſente men of warre in to the countre / 
but they were fierſly driuen backe agayne by
the erles men / ſo that wheder they wolde or no
they were fayne to drawe backe / orels they had
loſte more than they ſhulde haue wonne. With
this the duke of Berrey was ſore diſpleaſed wt
the erle of Foiz / & he ſayd: Howe therle of Foiz
was the moſt preſumptuous & proudeſt knight
of all the worlde: The duke as than coude ſuffre
no good to be ſpoken of hym / howe be it he
made hym no warre / for the erle of Foiz had alwayes
his townes and caſtelles ſo well prouyded
for / that none durſte entre in to his lande.
But whan the duke of Berry came in to Languedocke
than he left his rule / for he wolde thā
no lengar exercyſe agaynſte the duke / but the
diſpleaſure reſted ſtyll after a certayne ſpace:
But nowe ſhall I ſhewe you by what meanes
the peace was noriſſhed bytwene them.
            IT was a ten yere paſte that the lady Ellyanour
of Comynges / as nowe coūteſſe
of Bouloyne / and nere coſyn to therle of Foiz / 
and right enherytour to the countie of Comynges / 
thoughe that the erle of Armynake hadde
it in poſſeſſion. She came to Ortaiſe to therle
of Foiz / and brought with her a yonge doughter
of thre yere of age. Therle her coſyn made
her good chere / and he demaunded her of her
buſyneſſe
                  •
               and wheder ſhe was goynge. Sir
quod ſhe / I am goynge in to Arragon to myne
vncle and Aunte / the erle of Vrgell / and there
I purpoſe to abyde: For I haue great diſpleaſure
to abyde with my huſbande ſir Iohan of
Boloyne / for I thought he wolde haue recouered
myne enherytaunce of Comynges fro the
erle of Armynake / who kepeth it fro me: And
he hath my ſuſter in priſone / and he wyll do no
thyng in the mater: He is ſo ſofte a knight that
he wyll do nothynge / but take his eaſe and eate
and drinke / and to ſpende that he hath folyſſhlye:
and I thynke whan he is erle / he wyll take
his pleaſure more. Therfore I wyll no lengar
abyde with hym / and I haue brought with me
my doughter / whom I wyll delyuer in to your
handes / prayenge you to kepe and to noriſſhe
her vp / for I truſt by reaſon of her lygnage / ye
wyll nat fayle thus to do / for I haue hoope in
you that ye wyll kepe her. I had moche payne
to gette her awaye out of the countrey / and out
of the handes of my huſbande her father: But
bycauſe I take thē of Armynake myne aduerſaries
and yours
                  •
                who wolde gladly ſteale my
doughter awaye / bycauſe ſhe is enherytour of
Comynges / therfore I haue brought her vnto
you. Wherfore ſir / I requyre you fayle me nat
at this buſyneſſe: And I am ſure her father my
huſbande whan he knoweth yt I haue lefte her
with you / he wyll be right ioyfull▪ For he hath
ſayd often tymes to me / that this his doughter
ſhulde put hym to great doute. And whan the
erle had well herde the wordes of the lady Elyanour
his coſyn he was right ioyfull: And ymagined
in him ſelfe / howe that childe after ſhuld
do hym ſome pleaſure / as by the meanes of her
mother / to haue a ferme peace wt his enemyes / 
or els to marry her in ſo highe a place / that his
ennemyes ſhulde doute hym therby: Than he
anſwered the lady and ſaid. Madame and coſyn / 

all that ye deſyre I ſhall do it with right a
good wyl / for I am bounde therto by lynage:
and as for your doughter my coſyn I ſhall kepe
her as well / as though ſhe were myne owne
proper chylde. Sir quod ſhe / I thanke you.
Thus the yong doughter of Bouloyne abode
with the erle of Foiz at Ortaiſe / and ſhe neuer
departed thens ſithe: and the lady her mother
went to Arragon. She hath been ſithe ones or
twyſe toſe her doughter / but ſhe neuer deſyred
to haue her agayne / for therle kepte her as well
as if ſhe were his owne chylde. And to the purpoſe
as to the meane of the peace that I ſhewed
you / the erle ymagined to gette by her / the loue
agayne of the duke of Berrey: And as nowe at
this preſent tyme the duke of Berry hath gret
deſyre to be marryed: and I thynke by that I
herde at Auygnon by the Pope / who is coſyn
germayne to the ladyes father. He ſhewed me
howe the duke of Berrey deſyreth to haue her
in maryage. Ah ſaynt Mary ſir quod I / howe
your wordꝭ be to me right agreable / for it hath
done me great pleaſure / all that euer ye haue
ſhewed me whiche ſhall nat be loſte / for it ſhall
be putte in remēbraunce and cronycled / if god
wyll ſende me the grace to retourne to the towne
of Valencēnes / where as I was borne. But
ſir / I am ſore diſpleaſed of one thynge. What
is that ꝙ he? I ſhall ſhewe you. By my faithe
that ſo hyghe and valyant a prince as the Erle
of Foiz is / ſhulde be without laufull iſſue. ſir
quod the knight / if he had one as ones he had / 
he ſhulde be the moſt ioyouſe prince of the worlde / 
and ſo wolde be all the coūtre. Why ſir than
quod I / is his lande than withoute an heyre?
Nay ſir ꝙ he / the Vycount of the caſtell Bone
his coſyn germayne is his heyre. Is he a valyant
man in armes quod I? Nay be my faythe
ſir quod he / and therfore the Erle loueth hym
nat / and thynketh to make his two baſtarde ſō
               nes / 
who be right valyant / his heyres. & thynketh
to marry them in an highe lygnage / for he
hath golde and ſyluer ynough / wherby he thynketh
to gette theym wyues / ſuche as ſhall ayde
and conforte them. Sir quod I / it maye well
be. Howe be it the thyng is nat reaſonable / that
baſtardes ſhulde be made herytours of landes
Wherfore nat ſir quod he / if there lacke good
heyres. Se you nat howe the ſpaynierdes haue
crowned Henry a baſtarde to be kyng? and
alſo they of Portyngale crowned a baſtarde to
their kynge. It hath been ſene in the worlde in
dyuers realmes / that baſtardes by force hathe
reygned. Was nat Wyllyam Conquerour baſtarde
ſonne to a duke of Normandy / who conquered
all Englande / and was kynge there / ſo
that all the kynges ſyth are diſcended fro hym?
Sir quod I / all this might well be / ther is no
thyng but that may fall / but they of Armynake
are right ſtronge: and ſo therby this countrey
ſhalbe euer in warre and ſtryfe. but ſir / I pray
you ſhewe me the iuſt cauſe why the warre firſt
moued bytwene them of Foiz and Armynake.
I wyll ſhewe you ꝙ the knight. I enſure you
it is a marueylous warre / for as they ſaye / eche
of thē haue cauſe. Sir aunciently about a hū
               dred
yere paſt / there was a lorde in Byerne called
Gaſcone / a ryght valyant man in armes / &
is buryed in the freres right ſolempnely at Ortaiſe / 
and there ye may ſe what perſone he was
of ſtature and of body / for in his lyfe tyme his
pycture was made in latyn / the whiche is yet
there. This Gaſcone lorde of Bierne had two
doughters / the eldeſt was maryed to the erle of
Armynake that was than̄e / and the yongeſt to
the erle of Foiz / who as than was nephue to the
kyng of Aragon / and as yet therle of Foiz beareth
his armes / for he diſcended out of Aragon
his armes are palle golde and goules: And ſo
it fortuned / that this lorde of Biern had a gret
warre agaynſt the kynge of Spayne that was
than / who came through all Biſquay wt a gret
nombre of men of warre to entre in to Bierne.
The lorde Gaſcone of Bierne whan he was enformed
of his comyng / he aſſembled people on
all ſydes / where he might get men of warre / &
wrote letters to his two ſonnes in lawe / therle
of Armynake and therle of Foiz / yt they ſhulde
come to ſerue and ayde hym to defende his herytage.
Theſe letters ſene / the erle of Foiz as
ſone as he myght aſſēbled his people / & prayed
all his frendes / ſo moche / that he had a fyue hū
               dred
knightꝭ and ſquiers armed / and two thouſande
varlettes with ſpeares / dartes / & paueſſes / 
all a fote: And ſo he came in to the countre
of Bierne to ſerue his father / who had of hym
great ioye. And ſo all they paſſed the bridge at
Ortaiſe ouer the ryuer / & lodged bytwene Sanetere
and thoſpytall. & the kyng of Spayne / 
who had .xx.M. men was lodged nat far thens
and ther the lorde Gaſcon of Bierne & therle of
foiz taryed for therle of Armynac / & thought euer
yt he wolde cōe. & ſo taried for hi thre dayes
and on the .iiii. day therle of Armynac ſent his

letters by an haraulde to the lorde Gaſcoine of
Bierne / and ſente hym worde howe he myght
nat come / nor howe he hadde nothyng to do to
beare armes for the countre of Bierne. Whan
the lorde Gaſcoyne herde thoſe tidynges of excuſacions / 
and ſawe howe heſhulde haue none
ayde nor conforte of the Erle of Armynake / he
was ſore abaſſhed / and demaunded counſayle
of the erle of Foiz / and of the other barones of
Bierue / howe they ſhulde maynteyne thē ſelfe.
Sir quod the erle of Foiz / ſithe we be here aſſembled
let vs go and fight with our enemyes.
this counſayle was taken / than they ordayned
their people / they were a twelfe hūdred men of
armes and ſixe thouſande men a fote. The erle
of Foiz tooke the firſt batayle / and ſo came on
the kyng of Spaygne and ſette on his lodgynges.
And there was a great batayle and a fierſe
and ſlayne mo than ten thouſande ſpayniardꝭ / 
and there therle of Foiz toke priſoners the kynge
of Spaygnes ſonne and his brother / & ſent
them to his father in lawe the lorde Gaſcoyne
of Bierne / who was in the areregarde. & there
the ſpaynyerdes were ſo diſconfyted / that the
erle of Foiz chaſed them to the porte ſaynt Adrian
in Biſquay / and the kynge of Spayne toke
the abbey / and dyde on the veſture of a monke
or els he had ben taken. Than the erle of Foiz
retourned to the lorde Gaſcone of Bierne / who
made hym good chere / as it was reaſon / for he
had ſaued his honour and kepte his countre of
Bierne / the whiche els was lykely to haue ben
loſte / bycauſe of this batayle and diſconfyture
that the erle of Foiz made on the ſpaygnierdes
and for the takyng of the kynges ſonne and brother / 
and the lorde of Bierne hadde peace with
the ſpaygnierdes / at his owne wyll: And whan
the lorde Gaſcoyne was retourned to Ortaiſe / 
there before all the barons of Foiz and Bierne / 
that were there preſent: Heſayd to his ſonne of
Foiz. Fayre ſonne / ye are my true and faithfull
ſonne / ye haue ſaued myne honour and my coū
               trey.
The erle of Armynake who hath maryed
myne eldeſt doughter / hath ercuſed hym ſelfe
fro this buſyneſſe / and wolde nat come to defē
               de
myne herytage wherin he ſhulde haue part / 
Wherfore I ſaye / that ſuche parte as he ſhulde
haue by reaſon of my doughter / he hath forfait
and loſt it / And here clerely I enheryte you my
ſonne of Foiz after my dyſceaſe of all the hoole
lande / and to your heyres for euer. And I deſyre / 
wyll / and commaunde all my ſubiectes / to
ſeale / accorde / and agre to the ſame. And all anſwered / 
howe they were well contente ſo to do.
Thus by this meanes / as I haue ſhewed you / 
aunciently the erles of Foiz were lordes of the
countre of Bierne / and bare the crye / armes / &
name: and had the profyte therof. Howe be it / 
for all this they of Arminake had nat their clay
me quyte. This is the cauſe of the warre by / 
twene Foiz and Armynake. By my faythe ſir
than quod I / ye haue well declared the mater;
I neuer herde it before. And nowe yt I knowe
it / I ſhall putte it in perpetuall memorie / if god
gyue me grace to retourne in to my countrey.
But ſir / if I durſte I wolde fayne demaunde
of you one thynge. by what inſydent the erle of
Foiz ſonne dyed? Thafie the knyght ſtudyed a
lytell and ſayd. Sir / the maner of his dethe is
right pytuous / I wyll nat ſpeke therof: Whan
ye come to Ortaiſe / ye ſhall fynde thē that wyll
ſhewe you if ye demaunde it: And than I helde
my peace / and we rode tyll we came to Morlens.

            Of the great vertuouſneſſe and largeſſe
that was in therle of Foiz / and
the maner of the pytuouſe dethe of
Gaſcone the erles ſonne. Cap. xxvi.
            
               THe next day we departed
and roode to Dyner to
Moūtgarbell and ſo to Ercye / 
& there we dranke: And
by ſonne ſetting we came to
Ortaiſe. The knight a lighted
at his owne lodgynge &
I a lyghted at the Mone / wher dwelte a ſquier
of the erles Erualton de Pyne / who well receyued
me / bycauſe I was of Fraunce. Sir
Spayne of Leon wente to the caſtell to therle
and founde hym in his galarye / for he had but
dyned a lytell before: For the erles vſage was
alwayes / that it was hyghe noone or he aroſe
out of his bedde / and ſupped euer at mydnight
The knight ſhewed hym howe I was come thider / 
and incontynent I was ſente for to my ladgynge / 
for he was the lorde of all the worlde yt
mooſt deſyred to ſpeke with ſtraūgers / to here
tidynges. Whan the erle ſawe me he made me
good chere & reteyned me as of his houſe / wher

me was / bycauſe I had brought with me a boke / 
whiche I made at the contēplacion of Vmſlance
of Boeſme / duke of Luzenbourge and
of Brabant: Whiche boke was called the Melyader / 
conteyninge all the ſonges / baladdes / 
rundeaux / and vyrelayes / whiche the gentyll
duke had made in his tyme / whiche by imagynacyon
I had gadered toguyder / whiche boke
the erle of Foiz was gladde to ſe. And euery
night after ſupper I reed theron to hym / and
whyle I reed / there was none durſt ſpeke any
worde / bycauſe he wolde I ſhulde be well vnderſtande / 
wherin he tooke great ſolace. And
whan it came to any mater of queſtyon / than
he wolde ſpeke to me / nat in Gaſcoyne / but in
good and fayre frenche. And of his eſtate and
houſe I ſhall ſomewhat recorde / for I taryed
thereſo long / that I might well parceyue and
knowe moche. This erle Gaſcone of Foiz with
whom I was / at yt tyme he was of a fyftie yere
of age and nyne: and I ſay / I haue in my tyme
ſene many knightes / kynges / princes & other / 
but I neuer ſawe none lyke hym / of perſonage
nor of ſo fayre forme / nor ſo well made. His vyſage
fayre / ſanguyne / & ſmylyng: his eyen gray
and amorous / where as he lyſt to ſet his regarde:
in euery thyng he was ſo parfite that he can
nat be praiſed to moche. He loued that ought to
be beloued / & hated that ought to be hated: He
was a wyſe knyght / of highe enterpriſe / and of
good counſayle: he neuer had myſcreant with
hym: He ſayd many oriſons / euery daye a nocturne
of the pſalter / matyns of our lady / of the
holy gooſt / and of the croſſe: and dirige euery
day. he gaue fyue florens in ſmall money at his
gate to poore folkes / for the loue of god: he was
large and courteſſe in gyftes: He coulde ryght
well take where it parteyned to hym / and to delyuer
agayne where as he ought: He loued hoū
               des
of all beeſtes wynter and ſomer: He loued
huntyng: he neuer loued folly outrage nor foly
larges: Euery moneth he wolde knowe what
he ſpended. He tooke in his countre to receyue
his reuenewes and to ſerue him notable ꝑſons / 
that is to ſaye .xii. receyuouts / and euer fro .ii.
monethes to two monethes / two of them ſhulde
ſerue for his receyte: For at the two monethes
ende / he wolde change and put other two in to
that offyce / and one that he truſted beſt ſhulde
be his comptroller / and to hym all other ſhulde
accompt: and the comptroller ſhulde accōpt to
hym by rolles and bokes written / and thaccōptes
to remayne ſtyll with therle. he had certeyne
cofers in his chambre / out of the whiche ofte tymes
he wolde take money to gyue to lordꝭ / knyghtes / 
and ſquyers / ſuche as came to hym: for
none ſhulde departe fro him without ſome gift
and yet dayly multiplyed his treaſure / to reſyſt
the aduētures and fortunes that he douted: He
was of good and eaſy acquayntance with euery
man / and amorouſly wolde ſpeke to thē: He
was ſhorte in counſayle and anſwers: He had
four ſecretaries / and at his riſyng they muſt euer
be redy at his hande without any callynge.
And whan any letter were delyuered him / and
that he had reed it / than he wolde calle them to
write agayne / or els for ſome other thynge. In
this eſtate therle of Foiz lyued / & at mydnight
whan he came out of his chambre in to the hall
to ſupper / he had euer before hym .xii. torches
brennyng / borne by .xii. varlettes ſtandyng before
his table all ſupper: they gaue a gret light / 
and the hall euer full of knightes and ſquyers / 
& many other tables dreſſed to ſuppe who wolde:
There was none ſhulde ſpeke to hym at his
table but if he were called: his meate was lightlye
wylde ſoule / the legges and wyngꝭ alonely / 
and in the day he dyd but lytell eate and drike:
He had great pleaſure in armony of inſtrumē
               tes / 
he coude do it right well hym ſelfe: he wolde
haue ſonges ſong before him: he wolde gladlye
ſe conſeytes and fanteſies at his table. And
whan he had ſene it / than he wolde ſende it to ye
other tables / bruely all this I conſydred & aduiſed.
And or I came to his court I had ben in
many courtes of kynges / dukes / princes / erles
and great ladyes / but I was neuer in none yt
ſo well liked me / nor ther was none more reioyſed
dedes of armes / than the erle dyde. There
was ſene in his hall / chābre / and court / knightes
and ſquyers of honour goyng vp & downe / 
and talkyng of armes and of amours. All honour
ther was founde / all maner of tidyngꝭ of
euery realme and countre ther might be herde
for out of euery coūtre there was reſort / for the
valyantneſſe of this erle. Ther I was enfourmed
of the mooſt parte of the dedes of armes yt
was done in Spayne / in Portyngale / in Aragon / 
in Nauar / in Englande / & in Scotlande
and in the fronters and lymitacions of Lāgue
docke: For I ſawe come thyder to therle while
I was there / knightes and ſquyers of all nacyons:
And ſo I was enformed by them & by the
erle him ſelfe of all thynges that I demaūded.
Ther I enq̄red howe Gaſcon therles ſon died
for 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Eſpayn of Leon wolde nat ſhewe me any
thing therof. & ſomoch I enq̄red / yt an aūcient
ſquyer & a notable māſhewed ye mater to me / &

began thus. True it is quod he / that the erle of
Foiz and my lady of Foiz his wife agreeth nat
well toguyder / nor haue nat done of a long ſeaſon.
And the diſcorde bytwene thē firſt moued
by the kyng of Nauar / who was brother to the
lady: For the kyng of Nauar pledged him ſelfe
for the lorde Dalbret / whom the erle of Foiz
had in priſone / for the ſōme of fyftie thouſande
frankes. And the erle of Foiz / who knewe that
the kyng of Nauarr was craftie & malycious / 
in the beginnyng wolde nat truſt hym / wherwt
the counteſſe of Foiz had great diſpleaſur and
indignacyon agaynſt the erle her huſbande / &
ſayd to hym. Sir / ye repute but ſmall honour
in the kyng of Nauar my brother / whā ye wyll
nat truſt hym for fyftie .M. frankes / thoughe
ye haue no more of the armynakes nor of the
labriſyence than ye haue / it ought to ſuffyce. &
alſo 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                / ye knowe well ye ſhulde aſſigne out my
dower / whiche moūteth to fyftie thouſande frā
               kes / 
whiche ye ſhulde put in to the hādes of my
brother the kyng of Nauarr: Wherfore ſir / ye
can nat be yuell payed. Dame quod he ye ſaye
trouthe / but if I thought that the kyng of Nauarr
wolde ſtoppe the payment for that cauſe / 
the lorde Dalbret ſhulde neuer haue gone oute
of Ortayſe / and ſo I ſhulde haue ben payed to
the laſt penny. And ſithe ye deſyre it I wyll do
it / nat for the loue of you but for the loue of my
ſonne. So by theſe wordes and by the kyng of
Nauars oblygacion / who became dettoure to
the erle of Foiz / the lorde Dalbret was delyuered
quyte and became frenche / & was maryed
in Fraūce / to the ſuffer of the duke of Burbone
and payed at his eaſe to the king of Nauar the
ſōme of fyftie thouſande frankes for his raunſome:
For the whiche ſōme the kyng was boū
               de
to therle of Foiz / but he wolde nat ſende it to
the erle. Than the erle of Foiz ſayd to his wyfe
Dame / ye muſt go in to Nauarre to the kynge
youre brother / and ſhewe hym howe I am nat
well content with hym / that he wyll nat ſende
me that he hath receyued of myne. the lady anſwered / 
howe ſhe was redy to go at his cōmaū
               dement.
And ſo ſhe departed and rode to Panpylone
to the kynge her brother / who receyued
her with moche ioye / the lady dyd her meſſage
fro poynt to poynt. Than the kyng anſwered / 
fayre ſuſter / the ſōme of money is yours / therle
ſhulde gyue it for your dowre / it ſhall neuer go
out of the realme of Nauarr / ſithe I haue it in
poſſeſſyon. Ah ſir quod ye lady / by this ye ſhall
ſette great hate bytwene therle my huſbande &
you / & if ye holde your purpoſe / I dare nat retoure
agayne in to the countie of Foiz / for my
huſbande wyll ſlee me / he wyll ſaye I haue diſceyued
him. I can nat tell quod the kyng what
ye wyll do / outher tarye or deꝑte / but as for the
money I wyll nat departe fro it / it parteyneth
to me to kepe it for you / but it ſhal neuer go out
of Nauer. the counteſſe coude haue none other
anſwere of the kyng her brother. And ſo ſhe taryed
ſtyll in Nauar and durſt nat retourne agayne.
The erle of Foiz whan he ſawe the dealynge
of the kynge of Nauar / he began to hate
his wyfe and was yuell content with her / howe
be it ſhe was in no faute / but that ſhe returned
nat agayne whan ſhe hadde done her meſſage / 
but ſhe durſt nat: for ſhe knewe well therle her
huſbāde was cruell where he toke diſpleaſure.
Thus the mater ſtandeth. The erles ſonne called
Gaſcone / grewe and waxed goodly / & was
maryed to the doughter of therle of Armynake
a fayre lady / ſuſter to therle that nowe is / The
lorde Bertrande of Armynake. and by the contūctyon
of that maryage / ther ſhulde haue ben
peace bytwene Foiz & Armynake. The chylde
was a fyftene or ſixtene yere of age / and reſembled
rightwell to his father: On a tyme he deſyred
to go into Nauar to ſe his mother and his
vncle the kynge of Nauarr / whiche was in anyuell
hour for hym & for all this countre. Whan
he was come in to Nauarre / he had there good
there / and taryed with his mother a certayne
ſpace and than toke his leaue: but for all that he
coude do / he coude nat gette his mother out of
Nauer / to haue gone with hym in to Foiz / for
ſhe demannded if the erle had cōmaunded hym
ſo to do or no: and he anſwered / that whan he
departed / therle ſpake nothyng therof. Therfore
the lady durſt nat go thider / but ſo taryed
ſtyll / Than the chylde wente to Panpylone to
take his leaue of the kyng his vncle. The kyng
made hym great chere and taryed hym there a
ten dayes / and gaue to him great giftes and to
his men: alſo the laſt gyfte that the kyng gaue
hym was his dethe. I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            Whan this gētylman ſhulde depte / the kyng
drewe hym a parte in to his chambre and gaue
hym a lytell purſe full of poudre / which poudre
was ſuche / that if any creature lyueng dyd ete
therof / he ſhulde incōtynent dye without remedye:
Than the kynge ſayd / Gaſcone fayre nephue / 
ye ſhall do as I ſhall ſhewe to you: ye ſe
howe the erle of Foiz your father / wrongfully
hath your mother my ſuſter in gret hate / wher
of I am ſore diſpleaſed / and ſo ought ye to be:

Howe be it to performe all the mater / and that
your father ſhulde loue agayne your mother / 
to that entent ye ſhall take a lytell of this powder / 
and put it on ſome meate that your father
maye eate it / but beware that no man ſe you. &
as ſoone as he hath eaten it / he ſhall entende to
nothynge / but to haue agayne his wyfe / and ſo
to loue her euer after / whiche ye ought greatly
to deſyre: And of this that I ſhewe you let no
man knowe / but kepe it ſecrete / or els ye leſe all
the dede. The chylde who thought all that the
kyng ſayd to hym had ben true / ſayde. Sir / it
ſhalbe done as ye haue deuyſed / and ſo departed
fro Panpylone and retourned to Ortayſe / 
the erle his father made hym good chere / & demaunded
tidynges of the kyng of Nauar / and
what gyftes he had gyuen him. And the chylde
ſhewed hym howe he had gyuen hym dyuers / 
and ſhewed hym all excepte the purſe with the
pouder. Ofte tymes this yong Gaſcone & yuan
his baſtarde brother laye toguyder / for they loued
toguyder lyke bretherne / and were lyke arrayed
and apparelled / for they were nere of a
greatneſſe and of one age. And it happened on
a tyme as their clothes laye toguyder on their
beddes / yuan ſawe a purſe at Gaſcons cote / &
ſayd. What thyng is this that ye beare euer about
you? Wherof Gaſcoyne had no ioye / and
ſayd. yuan / gyue me my cote / ye haue nothyng
to do therwith: and all that day after Gaſcone
was penſyue. And it fortuned a thre dayes after / 
as god wolde / that the erle ſhulde be ſaued.
Gaſcone and his brother yuan fell out toguyder
playeng at tennes / and Gaſcone gaue hym
a blowe: and the chylde wente in to his fathers
chambre and wepte / and the erle as than hadde
herde maſſe. And whan the erle ſawe him wepe
he ſaid. Sonne yuan / What ayleſt thou? Sir
quod he / Gaſcone hath beaten me / but he were
more worthy to be beaten than I. Why ſo quod
therle? and incontynent ſuſpected ſome thyng.
By my faithe ſir ꝙ he / ſithe he retourned out of
Nauar / he beareth priuely at his breſt a purſe
full of pouder / I wote nat what it is / nor what
he wyll do therwith. But he hath ſayde to me
ones or twyſe / that my lady his mother ſhulde
ſhortely be agayne in your grace / and better be
loued than euer ſhe was. Peace quod the erle
and ſpeke no more / and ſhewe this to no man
lyuenge. Sir quod he no more I ſhall. Than
the erle entred in to ymaginacyon
                  •
                and ſo came
to the houre of his dyner / and waſſhed and ſat
downe at his table in the hall. Gaſcone his ſon
was vſed to ſette downe all his ſeruyce / and to
gyue the ſayes. And whan he had ſette downe
the firſt courſe / the erle caſt his eyen on hym / &
ſawe the ſtrynges of the purſe hangyng at his
boſome: Than his blode chaūged & ſaid. Gaſcone
cōe byder / I wyll ſpeke with the in thyne
eare. The chylde came to him / and the erle toke
hym by the boſome and founde out the purſe / &
with his knyfe cut it fro his boſome. the chylde
was abaſſhed & ſtode ſtyll and ſpake no worde
and loked as pale as aſſhes for feare / & began
to trymble. The erle of Foiz opyned the purſe
and toke of the pouder / and layde it on a trenchour
of bredde / and called to him a dogge and
gaue it hym to eate: and aſſoone as the dogge
had eaten the firſt morſell / he tourned his eyen
in his heed and dyed incontynent
                  •
               . And whan̄e
the erle ſawe that he was ſore diſpleaſed / & alſo
he had good cauſe: and ſo roſe fro the table and
toke his knife / and wolde haue ſtryken his ſon.
Than the knightes and ſquyers ran bytwene
them and ſaid. Sir / for goddes ſake haue mercy / 
and be nat ſo haſtye: Be well enformed firſt
of the mater / or ye do any yuell to your chylde.
And the firſt worde that therle ſaid was. A gaſcone
treatour / for to encreaſe thyne herytage yt
ſhulde come to the / I haue had warre and hatered / 
of the Frenche kyng / of the kyng of Englā
               de / 
of the kyng of Spayne / of the kyng of Nauar / 
and of the kyng of Arragon. and as yet I
haue borne all their maleſſes / and nowe yu woldeſt
murther me / it moueth of an yuell nature / 
but firſt thou ſhalt dye with this ſtroke / and ſo
ſtept forthe with his knife & wolde haue ſlayne
him / but than all the knightes and ſquyers kneled
downe before hym wepynge / and ſayd. Ah
ſir / haue mercy for goddes ſake / 
                  ••
               ee nat Gaſcone
your ſonne / remēbre / ye haue d
                  •
                more chyldren.
Sir / cauſe hym to be kepte / & take good
enformacion of the mater. Paradnenfure he
knewe nat what he bare / and paraduenture is
nothyng gyltie of the dede. Well quod the erle
incontynent put hym in priſone / and let hym be
ſo kepte / that I may haue a reconyng of hym.
Than the chylde was put in to the towre. & the
erle toke a great many of them that ſerued his
ſonne / and ſome of them departed / and as yet
the byſſhoppe of Laſcalle is at Pan out of the
countre / for he was had in ſuſpect / and ſo were
dyuers other. Therle canſed to be put to dethe
a fyftene right horribly / and the cauſe that the
erle layde to them was / he ſayde. It coulde be
none otherwyſe / but that they knewe of ye chyldes
ſecretes / wherfore they ought to haue ſhewed
it to hym / and to haue ſaid. Sir / Gaſcone

your ſonne beareth a purſe at his boſome. Bycauſe
they dyde nat thus / they dyed horribly / 
wherof it was great pytie / for ſome of thē were
as freſſhe and as ioly ſquyers / as were any in
all the coūtre / for euer the erle was ſerued with
good men. This thynge touched the erle nere
to the herte / and that he well ſhewed: For on a
day he aſſembled at Ortaiſe / all the nobles and
prelates of Foiz and of Bierne / and all the notable
perſons of his countrey. And whan they
were all aſſembled / he ſhewed theym wherfore
he ſente for thē / as howe he had foūde his ſonne
in this defaute: For the whiche he fayd / his entent
was to putte hym to dethe / as he had well
deſerued. Than all ye people anſwered to that
caſe with one voyce / and ſayde. Sir / ſauynge
your grace / we wyll nat that Gaſcoyne ſhulde
dye / he is your heyre / and ye haue no mo. And
whan the erle herde the people howe they deſyred
for his ſonne / he ſōwhat refrayned his yre.
Than he thought to chaſtyce hym in priſone a
moneth or two / and than to ſende hym on ſome
voyage for two or thre yere / tyll he might ſomwhat
forget his yuell wyll / and that the chylde
might be of greatter age & of more knowledge
Than he gaue leaue to all the people to depart
but they of Foiz wolde nat departe fro Ortaiſe
tyll the erle ſhulde aſſure them / that Gaſcoyne
ſhulde nat dye: they loued the chylde ſo well.
Than the erle promyſed them / but he ſayd: he
wolde kepe hym in priſone a certayne ſpace to
chaſtice hym. And ſo vpon this promyſe euery
man departed / and Gaſcone abode ſtyll in priſone.
Theſe tidynges ſpredde abrode in to dyuers
places / and at that tyme pope Gregorie
the .xi. was at Auygnon. Than he ſente the cardynall
of Amyens in legacion in to Byerne: to
haue come to therle of Foiz for that buſineſſe. &
by that tyme he came to Beſiers he herde ſuche
tidynges / that he neded nat to go any further
for that mater / for there he herde howe Gaſcon
ſonne to the erle of Foyz was deed. Sythe I
haue ſhewed you ſo moche / nowe ſhall I ſhewe
you howe he dyed.
            THe erle of Foyz cauſed his ſonne to be
kepte in a darke chambre / in the towre
of Ortayſe a tenne dayes / lytell dyde he eate or
drinke / yet he had ynoughe brought hym euery
daye: but whan he ſawe it he wolde go therfro / 
and ſette lytell therby. And ſome ſayd / that
all the meate that had been brought hym ſtode
hole and entier / the day of his dethe: wherfore
it was great marueyle that he lyued ſo longe / 
for dyuers reaſons. The erle cauſed hym to be
kepte in the chambre alone withoute any company / 
outher to coūſayle or conforte hym. And
all that ſeaſon the chylde laye in his clothes as
he came in / and he argued in him ſelfe and was
full of malencoly / and curſed the tyme that euer
he was borne and engendred / to come to ſuche
an ende. The ſame day that he dyed they that
ſerued hym of meate & drinke / whan they came
to hym / they ſayde. Gaſcone / here is meate for
you: he made no care therof / and ſayde: Sette
it downe there. He that ſerued hym / regarded
and ſawe in the priſon all the meate ſtande hole
as it had been brought hym before: And ſo departed
and cloſed the chambre dore / and went
to the erle and ſayd. Sir / for goddes ſake haue
mercy on your ſonne Gaſcone / for he is nere
famyſſhed in priſone there he lyeth. I thynke
he neuer dyde eate any thynge ſythe he came in
to priſone / for I haue ſene there this daye / all
that euer I brought hym before / lyeng toguyder
in a corner. Of thoſe wordes the Erle was
ſore dyſpleaſed / and withoute any worde ſpekyng
went out of his chambre / and came to the
priſone where his ſome was / and in anyuell
houre. He had the ſame tyme a lytell knyfe in
his hande to pare withall his nayles: He opyned
the priſone dore and came to his ſonne and
had the lytell knyfe in his hande / nat an ynche
out of his hande. And in great dyſpleaſure he
thruſte his hande to his ſonnes throte / and the
poynt of the knife a lytell entred in to his throte
in to a certayne vayne / and ſayd. Ah treatour / 
Why doeſt nat thou eate thy meate? And therwith
the Erle departed without any more doynge
or ſayeng / and went in to his owne chambre.
The chylde was abaſſhed and afrayed of
the comynge of his father / and alſo was feble
of faſtynge / and the poynt of the knyfe a lytell
entred in to a vayne of his throte / & ſo fell downe
ſodaynly and dyed. The erle was ſcante in
his chambre / but the kepar of the chylde came
to hym and ſayd. Sir / Gaſcone your ſonne is
deed. Deed quod the Erle? yea truely ſir quod
he. The erle wolde nat beleue it / but ſente thyder
a ſquyer that was by him / and he went and
came agayne and ſayd. Sir / ſurely he is deed.
Than the Erle was ſore diſpleaſed / and made
great complaynt for his ſonne / & ſayd. A Gaſcone:
What a poore aducnture is this for the &
for me? In an yuell hour thou wenteſt to Nauar

ſtronge dyſeaſe / and of the counteſſe
of Biſquay his wyfe. Cap. xxvii.
            
               WHan I had herde this
tale of the dethe of Gaſcone
ſonne to the erle of Foyz / I
hadde great pytie therof / for
the loue of therle his father / 
whome I founde a lorde of
hyghe recōmendacyon / noble / 
lyberall / and curteſſe: And alſo for loue of
the countrey / that ſhulde be in great ſtryfe tor
lacke of an heyre. Than I thanked the ſquyer
and ſo departed fro hym / but after I ſawe him
dyuers tymes in the erles houſe / and talked often
tymes with hym. And on a tyme I demaū
               ded
of hym of ſir Peter of Byerne / baſtarde
brother to therle of Foyz (bycauſe he ſemed to
me a knyght of great valure) wheder he were
riche / and maryed or no. The ſquyer aunſwered
& ſayd. Truely he is maryed / but his wyfe
and chyldren be nat in his company: And why
ſir quod I? I ſhall ſhewe you quod the ſquier.
¶This ſir Peter of Bierne hathe an vſage / 
that in the night tyme whyle he ſlepeth / he wyll
ryſe & arme hym ſelf / and drawe out his ſwerde
and fyght all aboute the houſe / and can nat tell
with whome / and than gothe to bedde agayne.
And whan he is wakynge / his ſeruautes do
ſhewe hym howe he dyde: And he wolde ſaye / 
he knewe nothymg therof / and howe they lyed.
ſōtyme his ſeruautes wolde leaue non armure
nor ſwerde in his chābre. & whan he wold thus
ryſe & fynde non armour / he wolde make ſuche
a noyſe and rumoure / as though all the deuylles
of helle had ben in his chambre. Than I demaunded
yf he had great landes by his wyfe.
yes truely ſir quod he: But the lady by whom
cometh the lande / ioyeth of the profytes therof.
This ſir Peter of Bierne hath but the fourthe
parte. Sir quod I / where is his wyfe? ſir ꝙ
he ſhe is in Caſtell with the kynge her coſyn.
her father was erle of Biſquay / and was c
                  •
               ſyn
germayne to kyng Dampeter who ſlewe him:
and alſo he wold haue had the lady to haue put
her in priſone. And he toke the poſſeſſion of all
the lande / and as long as he lyued the lady had
nothynge there. And it was ſayd to this lady / 
who was counteſſe of Biſquay / after the dyſſeaſe
of her father. Madame / ſaue youre ſelfe / 
for kyng Dampeter if he may gette you / wyll
cauſe you to dye / or els put you in priſone. He
is ſo ſore diſpleaſed with you / bycauſe he ſayth
ye ſhulde report and beare wytneſſe / yt he cauſed
the quene his wyfe to dye in her bedde / who
was ſuſter to the duke of Burbone and ſuſter
to the frenche quene / & your wordes (he ſayth)
are beleued / rather than̄e another / bycauſe ye
were preuy of her chambre. And for this cauſe / 
the lady Florens counteſſe of Biſquay / departed
out of her countre with a ſmalle company / 
as the cōmon vſage is: to flye fro dethe as nere
as men can. So ſhe went in to the countrey of
Baſcles and paſſed throughe it / and ſo came
hyder to Ortayſe to the Erle / and ſhewed hym
all her aduenture. The erle who had euer pyte
of ladyes and damoſelles / reteyned her: and ſo
ſhe abode with the lady of Caraſe / a great lady
in his countre. As than this ſir Peter of byerne
his brother was but a yonge knyght / and had
nat thanne / this vſage to ryſe a nyghtes / as he
dothe nowe. The erle loued hym well and maryed
hym to this lady / and recouered her land▪
And ſo this ſir Peter had by this lady a ſonne
and a doughter / but they be with their mother
in Caſtell / who be as yet but yong / therfore the
lady wolde nat leaue them with their father.
Ah ſaynt Mary quod I / howe dyde ſir Peter
of Bierne take this fantaſy? Firſt that he dare
nat ſlepe alone in his chambre / and that whan
he is a ſlepe / ryſeth thus and maketh all that be
ſyneſſe / they are thynges to be marueyled at.
By my faithe quod the ſquyer / he hath ben often
demaunded therof / but he ſaythe he can nat
tell wherof it cometh. The firſt tyme that euer
he dyde ſo / was the night after that he had ben
on a day a huntynge in the wodes of Biſquay / 
and chaſed a marueylous great Beare: and ye
beare had ſlayne four of his houndes / and hurt
dyuers / ſo that none durſt come nere him. than
this ſir Peter toke a ſwerde of Burdeanx and
came in great yre / for bycauſe of his houndes / 
and aſſayles the beare and fought longe with
hym / and was in great parell / and tooke great
payne or he coulde ouercome hym. Finally he
ſlewe the beare / and than retourned to his lodgyng

to the caſtell of Lāguedon in Biſquay / &
made the beare to be brought with him. Euery
man had marueyle of the greatneſſe of the beeſt
and of the hardneſſe of ye knight / howe he durſt
aſſayle the beare. And whan̄e the counteſſe of
Biſquayes wyfe ſawe ye beare / ſhe fell in a ſowne
and had great dolour / and ſo ſhe was borne
in to her chambre / and ſo all that day / the night
after / and the nexte day ſhe was ſore diſconforted / 
and wolde nat ſhewe what ſhe ayled. On
the thirde dayeſhe ſayd to her huſbande: Sir / 
I ſhall nat be hoole / tyll I haue been a pylgrimage
at ſaynt Iames. Sir / I praye you gyue
me leaue to go thyder / and to haue with me my
ſonne and Adrian my doughter: her huſbande
agreed therto. She toke all her golde / towels / 
and treaſure with her / for ſhe thought neuer to
retourne agayne / wher of her huſbande toke no
hede. So the lady dyde her pylgrimage / and
made an errande to go and ſe the kynge of Caſtell
her coſyn / and the quene. They made her
good chere / and ther ſhe is yet / and wyll nat retourne
agayne / nor ſende her chyldren. And ſo
thus the next night that this ſir Peter had thus
chaſed the beare and ſlayne hym / while he ſlept
in his bedde / this fātaſy toke hym. And it was
ſaid / that the counteſſe his wyfe knewe well / as
ſone as ſhe ſawe the beare / that it was the ſame
that her father dyde ones chaſe. And in his chaſyng / 
he herde a voyce and ſawe nothynge / that
ſayd to him. Thou chaſeſt me and I wolde the
no hurte / therfore thou ſhalt dye any yuell dethe.
Of this the lady had remembraunce / whan ſhe
ſawe the beare / by that ſhe had herde her father
ſaye before: and ſhe remembred well howe kynge
dan Peter ſtrake of her fathers heed / without
any cauſe / & in lykewiſe ſhe feared her huſbande.
And yet ſhe ſay the and maynteyneth / yt
he ſhall dye of an yuell dethe / and that he dothe
nothyng as yet / to that he ſhall do herafter.
            NOwe ſir / I haue ſhewed you of ſir Peter
of Byerue / as ye haue deman̄ded of
me / and this is a true tale / for thus it is / & thus
it be fell. Howe thynke you quod he therby? &
I who muſed on the great marueyle ſayd. ſir / 
I beleue it well / that it is as ye haue ſayde. ſir / 
we ſynde in olde writyng / that aūciently ſuche
as were called goddes and goddeſſes / at their
pleaſure / wolde chaunge and tranſforme men
in to beeſtes and in to foules / and in lykewyſe
women. And it might be ſo / that this 
                  •
               ere was
before ſome knight chaſyng in the foreſt of Biſquay / 
and paraduenture diſpleaſed in yt tyme / 
ſome god or goddes / wherby he was tranſformed
vnto a beare / to do there his penaunce / as
aunciently Acteon was chaūged vnto an hart.
Acteon quod the ſquyer / I pray you ſhewe me
that ſtorie / I wolde fayne here it. Sir quod I
accordyng to the auncyent writynges / we fynde
howe Acteon was a iolye & an expert knight
and loued the ſporte of huntynge aboue all games.
And on a day he chaſed in the wodes / and
an Harte aroſe before hym / marueylous great
and fayre: he hunted hym all the daye / and loſt
all his company / ſeruauntes / and hoūdes / and
he was right deſyrous to folowe his pray. And
folowed the fewe of the Harttyll he came in to
a lytell medowe / cloſed rounde about with wodes
and highe trees. And in the medowe there
was a fayre fountayne / in the whiche Dyana / 
goddeſſe of Chaſtyte was bayninge her ſelfe / 
and her damoſelles about her. The knight cāe
ſodaynly on them or he was ware / and he was
ſo farre forwarde / that he coulde nat go backe.
And the damoſelles were abaſſhad to ſe a ſtrā
               ger / 
and ran to their lady and ſhewed her / who
was a ſhamed / bycauſe ſhe was naked. & whan
ſhe ſawe the Knyght ſhe ſayde. Acteon / they
that ſente the hyder / loued the but lytell. I wyll
nat that whan thou arte gone hens in other places / 
that thou ſhuldeſt reporte that thou haſte
ſene me naked / and my damoſelles. and for the
outrage that thou haſt done / thou mayſt haue
penaunce. Therfore I wyll that thou be tranformed
in the lykeneſſe of the Iame Harte / that
thou haſte chaſed all this daye, and incōtynent
Acteon was tourned vnto an Harte / who naturally
loueth the water. In lykewiſe it might be
of the beare of Biſquay: and howe that the lady
knewe paraduenture / more than ſhe wolde
ſpeke of at that tyme / therfore ſhe ought the better
to be excuſed. The ſquier anſwered & ſayd.
Sir / it maye well be. Than we lefte oure talkynge
for that tyme.

and the burge of Piergourt and me / for I was
there as than to ſporte me. Ther he deſyred vs
all to ryde forthe with hym: We demaunded of
hym wheder he wolde ryde? By my faythe ꝙ
he / we wyll paſſe ye ryuer of Loyre at ſaint Thybalte:
and lette vs ſcale and aſſayle the towne &
caſtell of Sāxere. For quod he / I haue ſworne
and auowed / that I wyll nat entre in to no fortreſſe
that I haue / tyll I haue ſene the chyldren
of Sanxere. And if we maye gette that garyſon
and the erles chyldren within / Iohn̄ / Loys / 
and Robert: Than we ſhall be well reuenged / 
and therby we ſhalbe lordes of the countre / and
I thynke we ſhall lightly come to oure entent / 
for they take no hede of vs / and this lyeng ſtyll
here dothe vs no maner of ꝓfyte. That is true
ſir quod we / & ſo all we promyſed to ryde with
hym / and incontynent we made vs redy. And
ſo it fortuued / ye all oure purpoſe was knowen
in the towne of Sanxere. The ſame tyme ther
was▪ there a capitayn a valyant ſquyer of But
goyne of the lowe marcheſſe called Guyſſharte
Albygon / who toke great hede to kepe well the
towne and caſtell of Sanxer / and the chyldren
within. This ſir Guyſſhart had a mōke to his
brother / of the abbey of ſaynt Thybalt / whiche
is nere to Sanxere. This monke was ſent to
Charyte on the ryuer of Loyre for his brother / 
to beare a certayn raūſome thider yt the townes
owed by couynant. ſo we toke no hede to him &
he knewe all our ententes / howe I can nat tell / 
and all our names that were capitaynes there / 
and what nombre we were of / and what houre
we ſhulde departe / and howe we were determyned
to paſſe the ryuer at the porte of ſaynt Thybalte:
And ſo he retourned and went to Sanxere / 
and ſhewed his brother all oure myndes.
Than therle there and his bretherne prouyded
for remedy / and they ſente for knightes & ſquyers
of Berry and Burbonoyſe / and to the capitayns
& garyſons therabout / ſo that they were
a foure hundred ſpeares of good men of warre
and made abuſſhment of two hundred ſpeares
without the towne of Sanxere in a wode. and
we knewe nothyng of all this / and at the ſonne
goynge downe / we departed fro Charyte and
rode a good paſe tyll we came to Penly / and at
the porte there / we hadde redy bootes & barges
to paſſe vs ouer & oure horſes. And ſo we paſte
ouer the ryuer of Loyre as we had ordayned / 
and we were ouer by mydnight / and bycauſe ye
daye came on / we ordayned a hundred ſpeares
to abyde there to kepe oure horſes and bootes / 
and the remynaunt of vs paſſed forthe / for
                  •
                by
the frenche buſſhment. Whan we were paſte a
quarter of a myle / than they brake out of their
buſſhment / and rode to them that we had lefte

behynde vs at the ryuer ſyde. & anone they had
diſconfyted them and all ſlayne or taken / & our
horſes wonne / and the botes areſted. and than
they mounted on our horſes and came after vs
on the ſpurres / and were as ſoone in the towne
as we. They cryed our lady of Sāxere for the
erle was there hym ſelfe with his men / and his
bretherne / ſir Loyes and ſir Robert had made
the buſſhement. So thus we were incloſed on
all partes / for they a horſ backe aſſoone as they
cāe to vs / they a lighted afote and aſſayled vs
fierſly. And the thynge that mooſt greued vs / 
was we coude nat enlarge our ſelfe to fight / we
were in ſuche a narowe waye cloſed on bothe ſides
/ with hay / hedges / and vyngardes / & alſo
ſome of our enemyes ſuche as knewe the coūtre
were rydden about and gette in to the vyngardes / 
and dyd hurt vs ſore with caſtyng of ſtones
and we coude nat go backe / & moche payne
to gette to the towne / it ſtode ſo hygh on a moū
               tayne.
So we were ſore traueyled / & ſir Iohn̄
Aymery was hurt our ſouerayne capitayn / by
the hādes of ſir Guyſſhart Albygon / who toke
hym priſoner & had moche a do to ſaue his lyfe
he put hym in to a houſe in ye towne / and made
hym to be layde on a bedde / and ſayd to the owner
of the houſe. kepe well this priſoner / and / ſe
his woundes ſtaunched / for if he lyue / he ſhall
paye me .xx. thouſande frankes. & ſo ſir Guyſſhart
lefte his priſo
                  •
               er and retourned to the batayle / 
and quytte hymſelfe lyke a good man of
armes. & there was wt the chyldren of Sāxere / 
come thider to their ayde and to the countreis / 
ſir Guyſſhart dalphyn / the lorde Marney / ſir
Gerarde and ſir Wylliam Burbone / the lorde
of Couſant / the lorde de la Pier / the lorde de la
Palys / the lorde of Neutry / the lorde de la coiſe
and the lorde of Syette / and dyuers other. I
ſay ſir to you / this was a batayle right fell and
cruell. we defēded our ſelf as long as we might
ſo that on bothe partꝭ there were ſlayne dyuers
perſones / and many hurte: for by that they ſhewed
they had rather haue taken vs a lyue than
to ſlee vs / and finally we were all taken / Carſayle
launt / Nandon / le bourge de Pyergourt
Eſpyot / the burge of Leſpare / Angerot le moūt
gyſe / Philyppe of Roe / Peter of Corthue / the
Peſat of Palyuiers / the bourge of Daruſen / &
all our capitayns
                  •
                and I my ſelfe and we were
brought to the caſtell of Sāxere. Neuer before
in the realme of Fraunce / the companyons loſt
ſo moche as they dyde at that iourney / howe be
it Guyſſhart Albygon loſte his priſoner by neglygence / 
he bledde ſo ſore that he dyed
                  •
                for defaute
of lokyng vnto. Thus ended Iohan Aymery / 
by this iourney that was thus done beſyde
Sanxere / Charyte was delyuered / & all
the garyſons therabout by compoſycion / that
we ſhulde be quyte out of priſon / and ſo we had
ſaue conducte to departe out of the countre whider
we lyſt. And it fortuned as than for vs / that
the ſame ſeaſon ſir Bertram of Cleſquy / the lorde
of Beayne / ſir Arnolde Dandrehen / and the
erle of Marche / they toke their voiage to go in
to Spaygne to ayde the kyng Dampeter / but
firſt I was in Bretayne at the bataile of Alroy
vnder ſir Hughe Caurell / and there I recouered
my loſſe / for the iourney was ours. and I
had to my ꝑte good priſoners / by whom I had
two .M. frankes. Than I went with ten ſpeares
with ſir Hugh Caurell in to Spayne / and
there helped to put kyng Dampeter out of his
realme. And than whan ye alyances were made
bytwene the kyng Dampeter and the prince of
Wales / and that he wolde abyde in Caſtell / I
was there in the company of ſir Hugh Caurell
and I retourned with hym in to Acquitayne.
Than the warre renewed bytwene the frenche
kyng and the prince: than we had moche a do / 
for we had ſore warre / and many capitayns englyſſhe
and Gaſcoyns were ſlayne / and yet I
thāke god I am a lyue. Ther dyed ſir Robert
Briquet bytwene the lande of the duke of Orliance
and the countre of Bloyſe / in a place called
Oliuet / and there he & all his company were
ouerthrowen by aſquyer of Heynalt a valyant
man of armes & a good capitayne / called Alars
Douſtienes / ſurnamed Barbaſon / for he was
of that lynage. He was as than gouernoure of
Bloys / and kepar of all the countre / ſette there
by the lordes therof / as Loys / Iohn̄ / and Guy.
So it was his fortune to encoūtre with ſir Robert
Briquet & ſir Robert Cheney. & they and
all their cōpany were ſlayne / for ther were non
taken to raunſome. and at the batayle of Nyorthe
in Xayntaine / Carſnell was ſlayne by ſir
Bertram of Cleſquy / and a ſeuyn .C. englyſſh
men were ſlayne there / & at ſaint Seuere were
ſlayne other englyſſhe capitayns / as Rychard
Elys and Richarde Helyn. I knewe but fewe
expert my ſelfe but yt were ſlayne. I haue hold
fronter & made warre for the kyng of Englāde
for myne herytage lyeth in Burdelois. Somtyme
I haue been ſo ouerthrowen and pulled
downe / that I had nat wherwith to lepe a horſ
backe. And another tyme I haue been riche ynough
whan good fortunes came / & in a ſeaſon
I and Raymonet de la Pee were companions

togyder: and we had in Tholouſyn on the frō
               ters
of Bygore. The caſtell of Maluoyſin / the
caſtell of Trygalet / and the caſtell of Vāteulx / 
whiche as than dyde vs great profyte. Than̄e
the duke of Anion toke them fro vs / byforce of
puyſſaunce. but than Raymonet de Pee tourned
Frenche / and I abyde ſtyll good engliſſhe
and ſhall do whyle I lyue. True it was / whan
I had loſte the caſtell of Trygalet / and was cō
               ducted
to the caſtell Cuyllet / and that the duke
was gone backe agayne in to Fraunce / I determyned
to do ſomwhat / outher to gette ſome
profyte or els to loſe all / or to dye in the payne.
I cauſed by ſpyall / the towne & caſtell of Thury
in Albygo is to be well a viewed / whiche caſtell
after aueyled to me / what by good fortunes
and 
                  •
               ateſfyeng of the countrey a hundred
thouſande frankes. I ſhall ſhewe you howe I
wanne it.
            WIthout the towne there is a fayre foū
               tayne / 
and of vſage euery mornynge / 
the women of the towne wolde come
thyder with pottes and other veſſelles on their
heedes / to fetche of the clere water ther. Than
I toke fyftie cōpanyons of the garyſon of Cuillet / 
and we rode all a daye throughe wodes &
buſſhes / and the nexte night about mydnight / 
I ſette a buſſhment nere to Thury / and I and
a ſixe other all onely / dyde on vs womens aray
and with pottes in our handes. And ſo we cāe
to a medowe right nere to ye towne / and hydde
ourſelfe behynde great cockes of hay that were
there ſtandyng / for it was about the feeſt of ſaīt
Iohan / whan they make hay. & whan the hour
came that the gate was opyned to lette the women
go out for water / we ſeuyn toke our pottꝭ
and fylled them at the fountayne and wente towarde
the towne / oure faces wrapped in kerchers / 
ſo that we coude nat be knowen: the women
that we mette goyng for water ſaid to vs.
Ah ſaynt Mary goſſeppes / ye were vp be tymes:
We aunſwered in their lauguage with a
faynt voyce / that is true. And ſo paſte by them
and came to the gate / and we founde no body
there but a ſouter dreſſynge forthe of his baggage.
Than one of vs blewe a horne to drawe
thyder out cōpany out of the buſſhment. The
ſouter toke no hede but whan he harde ye horne
blowe he demaūded of thē. What is this? Who
was that blewe the horne? One anſwered and
ſayd. It was a preeſt wente into the feldes. Ah
that is true quod the ſouter / it was ſir Fraūces
our preeſt / gladly he gothe a mornyngꝭ to ſeke
for an Hare. Than our company came and we
entred in to the towne / where we foūde no man
to drawe his ſwerde to make any defence. thus
I toke the towne and caſtell of Thury / wherby
I haue had great profite yerely / more than
the caſtell of Trygalet with the appurtenaūce
is worthe. But as nowe I wote nat what to do
for I am in a treatie with therle of Armynake
and with the dolphyn of Auuergne / who hath
expreſſe authoritie by the Frenche kyng / to bye
all townes and fortreſſes of the companyons / 
ſuch as they holde in their handes wherſoeuer
they be / outher in Auuergne / Rouerg
                  •
               e / Lymoſyn / 
Quercy / Pyergourt / Albegois / Agen
& of all ſuche as hath or dothe make any warre
in the kyng of Englandes tytell / and many are
departed and haue rendred their fortreſſes / I
can nat tell if I wyll rendre myne or nat: With
that worde ſayd the Burge of Compayne. Coſyn / 
it is true: For of Carlat whiche I holde in
Auuergne / I am cōe hyder to here ſome tidynges / 
For ſir Loys of Sanxere marſhall of Frā
               ce
wyll be here ſhortely / he is as nowe at Tarbe / 
as I haue herde of ſuche as come thens. wt
theſe wordes they called for wyne and dranke.
Than the Baſtot ſayd to me. ſir Iohan / are ye
well enformed of my lyfe? yet I haue had other
aduētures whiche I haue nat ſhewed / nor wyll
nat ſpeke of all. ſir ꝙ I / I haue well herde you.
         
         
            ¶Howe a ſquyer called Limoſin turned
frenche / & howe he cauſed Loys
Rambalt his companyon in armes
to be taken. Cap. xxx.
            
               THan agayne I demaunded
of hym / where Rambalt an
expert ſquier and a great capitayne
of mē of Warr was
becōe / bycauſe I ſawe him
ones in Auignon in great aray.
I ſhall ſhewe you quod
the Baſtot of Manlyon. In tyme paſt whan
ſir Seguyn of Batefoyle helde Bride in Velay / 
a ten myle fro Puy in Auuergne / and that
he had made warre in the countre & conquered
moche / than he retourned in to Gaſcon & gaue
to Loyes Rābalt & to another cōpanyon of his
called Lymoſin / Bride & Anſe / on the water of
Sōme / the countre as than was ſo deſolate &
full of cōpanyons in euery corner / yt noue durſt
go out of their houſes / & bitwene Bride in Auuerne
& Anſe / is more than .xxvi. myle / a coūtre

full of moūtayns. and whan Loyes Rambalt
wolde ryde for his pleaſure fro Bride to Anſe / 
he rode without doute or feare / for he helde dyuers
fortreſſes in the countie of Foreſtes / and
therabout / wher he refreſſhed hym: For as thā
the gentylmen of Auuergne / of Foreſtz / of Velaye / 
and the fronters were ſore traueyled / and
ouer layde with the warre. they were ſo taken
and raunſomed that they doughted the warre / 
For there was none of the great lordes of Fraū
               ce
that ſente any men of warre in to the coūtre / 
for the frenche kynge was yonge / and had moche
a do in dyuers ꝑtes of the realme / for in euery
parte / the companyōs and companyes rode
and dyd moche hurte / ſo that the realme coude
nat be quyte of thē / And alſo dyuers of the lordes
of Fraunce were in Englande in hoſtage / 
and in the meane ſeaſon their countreys & men
were pylled and robbed / and had no remedy:
for the men of the countre were without corage
to defende themſelfe. And ſo it was / that Rambalte
and Lymoſin / who were companyons in
armes fell out / I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            LOyes Rambalte had at Bride a fayre
woman to his louer / whome he loued
parfitely: and whan he rode fro bride
to Anſe / he cōmaunded Lymoſin to take good
hede to her. And Lymoſin who was his companyon
in armes / and in whome he mooſt truſted / 
he toke ſo good hede to the damoſell / that
he had his pleaſure of her whan he lyſte / ſo that
Loyes Rambalte was enfourmed therof / and
he coude ſuffre it no lengar: So that he toke ſuche
a hate agaynſt his companyon / that he cauſed
hym to be taken by his ſeruauntes / & made
hym to be driuen all naked ſaue a breche: about
the towne / and beaten with ſcourges / and trū
               pettꝭ
to be blowen before him: And at certayne
places his dede to be openly cryed & than baniſſhed
the towne lyke a treatour / and in a ſymple
cote putte out. This diſpyte dyd Loyes Rambalte
to Lymoſin / whiche diſpyte Lymoſin toke
greuouſly / and ſayd: Howe he wolde be reuēged
if euer it laye in his power / as he was anone
after. And this Lymoſin whyle he was in
proſperite / in ridyng bytwene Bride and Anſe
he euer forbare the landes of the lorde of Voult
dwellyng on the ryuer of Rone / for he had ſerued
him in his youthe. Than he thought to go
to hym and to crye hym mercy / & to deſyre hym
to make his peace in Fraūce. and ſo in his cote
a fote he went to Voulte / for he he knewe ryght
well the way / and ſo went in to a houſe / & whan
he ſawe his tyme he wente to the caſtell / and the
porter wolde nat ſuffre hym to entre / but at laſt
he ſpake ſo fayre / that the porter dyde lette him
in / and cōmaunded hym to go no farther in wt
               out
he were cōmaunded / and he obeyed. Whan
the lorde was vp he went downe in to the court
to ſporte hym / and ſo came to the gate: Than
Lymoſin felle downe on his knees / and ſayde.
ſir / do ye nat knowe me? by my faithe quod the
lorde no: He thought lytell it ſhulde haue been
Lymoſin: and whan he had well aduyſed hym
he ſayd. Thou reſembleſt well Lymoſin / who
was ones my ſeruaunt. Sir quod he 
                  •
                Lymoſyn
I am and your ſeruaunt. than he cryed him
mercy for all thynges paſte before / and ſhewed
hym fro poynt to poynt all his buſyneſſe / and
howe Loyes Rambalte had dalte with hym at
the ende. Than the lorde ſayd. Lymoſyn / Is
it as tho ſayeſt / and that thou wylte becōe good
frenche I ſhall make thy peace. By my faith ſir
quod he / I neuer dyde ſo moche hurte to the realme
of Fraūce / but I ſhall do agayne more ꝓfyte
therto / that wolde I ſe gladly quod the lorde
of Voult. the lorde kept him in his houſe tyll
he had made his peace in euery place. and whā
Lymoſin myght in ſuretie ryde / than the lorde
of Voult armed hym / and brought hym to the
ſeneſhall of Velay and acquaynted hym there.
and ther he was examyned of the ſtate of bride
and of Loyes Rambalte / and whan he rydeth
what waye he taketh: and than he ſayd. Whan
Loyes rydeth he hath nat with him paſt a .xxx.
or a .xl. ſpeares: and the wayes that he kepeth
I knowe them by harte. For with hym & without
hym / I haue rydden them ofte tymes. And
ſir / if ye wyll ſende forthe a company of men of
armes / on ieopardy of my heed / ye ſhall haue
him within fyftene dayes. The capitayns ther
toke hede to his ſayeng and ſent out ſpyes / and
Rambaulte was ſpyed as he was rydinge fro
Bride to Anſe beſyde Lion / on the ryuer of Rone.
Whan Lymoſin knewe it / he ſhewed it to ye
lorde of Voult and ſayd. Sir / Loyes Rābalte
is nowe at Anſe / and at his retournyng I ſhall
bring you to a ſtreight / wher as he muſt nedes
paſſe by. Than the lorde of Voult made an aſſemble
and was capitayne hymſelfe / and ſente
for the bayly of Velay / the lorde of Mountelan
ſir Gerarde of Salyers and his ſonne / ſir Plā
               ſeart
of Vernet / the lorde of Newcaſtell / & for
other men of armes therabout: ſo that he was a
thre .C. ſpeares / and they all aſſembled at Nonnay / 
and by the coūſaile of Lymoſin they made
two buſſhmentes. the vicoūt of Polygnac & the

lorde of Chalencon had the rule of the one / and
the lorde Voulte and the lorde of Mount Clan
had the guydynge of the other buſſhment / and
with them ſir Loyes of Tornon / and the lorde
of Salyers: and they hadde equally deuyded
their company. The firſte company kepte the
paſe nere to ſaynt Rambart in Foreſtes / wher
as Loyes Rambalte ſhulde paſſe the ryuer of
Loyre / or els he muſte haue gone by Guyde or
Pynne. And whan Loyes Rambalt had done
that he came for to Anſe / he departed with a .xl.
ſpeares / and thought nat to haue any rencounter / 
and douted nothynge of Lymoſin / it was
the leeſt thought he had. And lightely euer the
way that he rode outwarde he wolde nat come
homewarde. And as he came outwarde he cāe
by ſaynt Rambalte / and at his retourne he toke
another waye / & toke the mountayns aboue
Lyon and aboue Vyenne / and vnder the Burge
Darlentall / And rode ſtreyght towarde the
Mounaſtier / a thre lytell myle fro Puye. And
he hadde paſſed bytwene the caſtell of Moneſtrole
and Mountfaucon / and ſo came aboute
the countre / towarde a vyllage called Batery / 
bytwene Nonnay and ſaynt Iulyane. And in
the wode there was a ſtreyght paſſage / whiche
he muſte
                  •
                nedes paſſe / or els to go by Nonnay.
at whiche ſtreight laye the lorde of Voult with
two hundred ſpeares / and Loyes Rambalt toke
no hede tyll he was among them. Than the
lorde of Voulte / who was redy to do his enterpriſe / 
layde the ſpeare in the reſt and came cryinge
la Voulte / and daſſhed in among the companyons / 
who rode abrode withoute good arraye.
And ſo at the firſt metyng / many of them
were ouerthrowen to the erthe / and Loyes Rā
               baulte
was ſtryken fro his horſe / by a ſquyer of
Auuergne called Amblardon: & ſo he toke hym
priſoner / and all other taken or ſlayne none ſcaped.
And ther they foūde in boiettes a thre .M.
frankes / whiche Loyes Rābalte had receyued
at Anſe / for trybute of certayne vyllages therabout / 
wherof they were gladde / for euery man
had his parte. And whan Lymoſin ſawe Rambalt
this trapped he came before hym / and ſayd
in reproche. Loyes Loyes: here fauteth company.
Remembre ye of the blame & ſhame that
ye dyde put me to at Bride for your mayſtres?
I wolde haue thought lytell for a woman / ye
wolde haue put me to that ye dyd. For if ye had
done as moche to me / I wolde nat haue been ſo
angry. for two ſuche cōpanyōs in armes as we
were / myght haue paſt our tyme well ynoughe
with one woman. With thoſe wordes the lordꝭ
laughed / but Loyes Rābalt had no ſporte herat.
By the takyng thus of this Loyes Rābalte
Bride was delyuered to the ſeneſhall of Auuergne / 
for after they had loſt their capitayne and
the chefe men they had / they wolde kepe it no lē
               gar:
And in lykewiſe ſo dyde they of Anſe / and
other fortreſſes in Velay & Foreſtes / that was
on their parte. for they within any of theſe for / 
treſſes were right ioyouſe to yelde vp their holdes
to ſaue their lyues. Than Loyes Rābalte
was brought to Nonnay and there ſet in priſone / 
and the frēche kyng had great ioye of his
takyng. & as I herde reported / he was beheeded
at Newcaſtell beſyde Auygnon. Thus
Loys Rambalt dyed / god haue mercy on him.
Thus ſir quod the Baſtot of Manlyon / I haue
holde you with talkyng / to paſſe awaye the
night / how be it ſir / all that I haue ſaid is true
Sir quod I / with all my herte I thanke you.
Sir / I truſt your ſayenges ſhall nat be loſte.
For ſir / & god ſuffre me to retourne in to myne
owne countre / all that I haue herde you ſaye / 
and all that I haue ſene and founde in my voyage / 
I ſhall put it in remembraunce / in the noble
cronycle that the erle of Bloys hath ſet me a
warke on: For I ſhall write it & cronycle it by
the grace of god / to the entent it ſhalbe in parpetuall
remembraunce. Than the Bourge of
Compayne / called Erualton began to ſpeke / &
wolde gladly that I ſhulde parceyue by hym / 
that he wolde I ſhulde recorde his lyfe / and of
the Bourge Englyſſhe his brother / and howe
they had done in Auuergne / and in other places.
But as than he had no leyſar / for the watche
of the caſtell ſowned to aſſemble all mē that
were in the towne to come vp to the Caſtell / to
ſuppe with the erle of Foiz. Thanne theſe two
ſquyers made them redy and lyghted vp torches / 
and ſo we wente vp to the Caſtell / and ſo
dyde all other knightes and ſquyers that were

            ¶Of the ſtate or ordynaunce of the
erle of Foyz: and howe the towne of
yran rebelled / for the great traueyle / 
domage / and outrage that was don
there to. Cap. xxxi.
            
               
               OF the aſtate and order
of the erle of Foiz can nat be
to moche ſpoken nor prayſed:
For the ſeaſon yt I was
at Ortaiſe / I foūde hym ſuche / 
and moche more than I
can ſpeke of: But whyle I
was there / I ſawe & herde many thynges that
turned me to great pleaſure. I ſawe on a Chriſtēmas
day ſytting at his borde / four byſſhoppes
of his countre / two Clementynes and two
Vrbanyſtes: the byſſhoppe of Pauyers & the
byſſhoppe of Leſcalle Clementynes / they ſatte
higheſt. Than the byſſhoppe of Dayre and the
byſſhop of Rone on the fronters of Burdeloys
and Bayon / Vrbaneſtes: Than ſatte therle of
Foiz / and than the vycount of Roquebertyn of
Gaſcone / and the vycount of Brunyquell / the
vycount of Ioſſeraūt / and a knight of Englād
of the duke of Lancaſters / who as than laye at
Narbone / the duke had ſent hym thyder: The
knight was called ſir Wyllyam Wylloughby.
And at another table ſatte fyue abbottes & two
knightes of Arragon / called ſir Raymonde de
Mount florentyne and ſir Marten de Ruane:
And at another table ſatte knightes and ſquyers
of Gaſcone and of Bigore. Firſt the lorde
of Daychin / than ſir Gaylari de la Mote / ſir
Raymōde of Newcaſtell / the lorde of Chamōt / 
Gaſcone / the lorde of Compane / the lorde de la
Layne / the lorde of Mountferant / ſir Wylliam
Bernarde / ſir Peter of Corton / the lorde of Valenchyn / 
and ſir Aungalle named the Baſell. &
at other tables knightes of Bierne a great nō
               bre / 
and the cheife ſtewardes of the halle were
ſir Eſpaygne of Leon ſir Siquart de Boyes
Verdune / ſir Nonnans of Nonnallys / and ſir
Peter of Vaulx of Bierne / and the two Erles
baſtarde bretherne ſerued at ye table / ſir Erualton
Guyllame and ſir Peter of Byerne: And
the erles two ſonnes. ſir yuan of Leſchell was
ſhewer and ſir Gracyen bare his cuppe. And
there were many Mynſttelles / as well of his
owne as of ſtraungers / and eche of them dyde
their deuoyre in their faculties. The ſame day
therle of Foiz gaue to harauldes and minſtrelles / 
the ſōme of fyue hundred frākes: and gaue
to the duke of Tourayns mynſtrelles gownes
of clothe of golde furred with Ermyns / valued
at two hundred frankes. This dyner endured
foure houres. Thus I am gladde to ſpeke of
the erle of Foyz / for I was there in his houſe a
xii. wekes / and well entreated in all thynges / &
whyle I was there / I might lerne and here tidynges
of all countreis. And alſo the gentyll
knyght ſir Eſpaygne of Leon / in whoſe company
I entred in to the countre: He cauſed me
to be acquaynted with knyghtes and ſquyers / 
ſuche as coude declare to me any thyng that I
roude demaunde: For I was enformed of the
buſyneſſe of Portingale and of Caſtell / & what
maner of warre they had made / and of the batayls
and rencounters bytwene thoſe two kynges
and their aſſyſters / of whiche buſyneſſes
I ſhall make iuſte report.
            yE haue herde here before: Howe kynge
don Iohan of Caſtell hadde beſieged
the caſtell of Luxbone / & the king
Iohan of Portyngale therin / whom the good
townes had crowned to their kyng for his valyantneſſe / 
howe be it in dede he was a baſtarde.
And alſo ye haue herde how the ſame kyng
ſende in to Englande to the duke of Lancaſtre
and to the erle of Cambridge / who had in maryage
his coſyns / to haue ſocour of thē. Theſe
meſſangers were two knyghtes and a clerke / 
ſir Iohan Radyngos and ſir Iohn̄ Dore / and
with them a clerke lycenſiate in the lawe / arche
deaken of Lyſbone. Theſe meſſangers dyd ſo
moche by the ſee / that they came to Hampton
and there taryed a daye / and there gate horſes
for they had none of their owne / and ſo rode to
London. This was in the moneth of Auguſt.
And the kyng was in the marches of Wales a
huntyng at his pleaſure / & his vncles / the duke
of Lācaſtre / therle of Cābridge / ſir Edmonde
and ſir Thomas erle of Buckyngham / 
were alſo in their owne countreis a
ſportynge / wherfore the kyng of Portyngales
meſſangers had more to do: ſo firſt they ſpake
with the duke of Lancaſtre / who was at Hertforde / 
a twentie myle fro London. The duke
receyued them ioyouſly / and opyned ye letters
that they brought him / and the duke reed them
thre tymes / the better to vnderſtande thē / and
than he ſayd. Sirs / ye be right welcome in to
this countre / but ye be come in the worſt tyme
of the yere / to haue ſpedy delyueraūce of your
ambaſſade / for the kyng and my bretherne are
ſparcled abrode here and the
                  •
                / and ye can haue
no full anſwere tyll the counſayle come toguyder
at London at the feeſt of ſaynt Mighaell:
But ſythe the great parte of your meſſage toucheth
me and my brother / therfore I will write
to hym / that he and I ſhalbe ſhortely at London / 
or therabout: and than we ſhall take coū
               ſayle / 
toguyder. Wherfore as nowe ye ſhall retourne

to London / & whan my brother is come
nere ye ſhall haue tidynges fro vs. The ambaſſadours
of Portyngale were content / and ſo retourned
to London and were well lodged and
toke their eaſe. The duke of Lancaſtre forgate
nat that they had ſayd to hym / and ſo incontynent
wrote to his brother therle of Cambridge
of that buſyneſſe. and whan therle had reed his
brothers letters / he prepared hym ſelf and rode
to Hertforde beſyde Ware whe
                  •
                the duke was / 
and there they were thre dayes togyder in coū
               ſayle.
and ſo ordayned to go to London as the
duke had promyſed to the ambaſſadours / and
ſo they came to London. Than theſe two lordꝭ
and they of Portyngale had great coūſayls bytwene
them / For the erle of Cābridge who had
ben before in Portyngale / was nothyng cōtent
with kyng Ferant of Portyngale laſt deed / for
he ſayd he made his warre but ſlackely. and alſo
agaynſt t
                  ••
               wyll of hym and all the Englyſſh
men / he toke peace with the ſpanyerdes / wherfore
the erle ſayd / he had doute that at the counſayle
at Myghelmas / the cōmontie wolde nat
agre lightly to make another vyage in to Portyngale / 
for the iourney thyder before had coſt
greatly the realme of Englande / and no ꝓfyte
therby. The ambaſſadours cōceyned well the
erles wordes / and ſayde. Sir / than was than
and nowe is nowe. The kyng whom god pardon / 
redouted greatly ye fortunes of the worlde
but the kyng our mayſter that nowe is / hath another
mynde & ymaginacion / For if he fynde
in the felde his enemyes / thoughe he be leſſe of
power / yet he wyll gyue the ſettyng on / whatſo
euer fall therby. And this ſir / we dare faythfully
aſſure you. and my lordes beſyde / that your
quarell is clere to ouerron and to conquere the
realme of Caſtell / for the enherytaunce parteyneth
to you and to your wyues / & to your chyldren.
& to conquere it / ye can nat haue ſo good
an entre in to Caſtell / as by Portyngale / ſythe
ye haue all that realme according therto. Therfore
ſir / and one of you wyll come thyder with
ſuche a ſuffycient nombre / and by the ayde ye
ſhall haue there / ye ſhalbe able to kepe the felde
The duke of Lancaſtre anſwered. Sirs / this
lyeth nat in vs / but in the kyng & in the realme / 
but we ſhall do oure good wylles / ye maye be
ſure therof. Thus they ended their counſayle / 
and the portyngalo is laye ſtyll at London abydyng
Mighelmas / and the duke of Lancaſtre
and the erle of Cambridge returned in to their
owne countreis on the marches of the Northe.
Than came Myghelmas and the parlyament
at Weſtmynſter / and the kynge approched and
came to Wyndeſore and ſo to Chertſey / and the
quene with hym / and than to Stanes / and alſo
his chefe of counſayle the erle of Oxenforde / 
for by him euery thyng was done / and without
hym nothynge. The ſame ſeaſon there was in
Flaūders bytwene the duke of Burgoyne and
the gaūtoiſe great warre. And the
                  •
                were newly
retourned out of Flaunders in to Englande
the byſſhoppe of Norwiche / ſir Hugh Caurell / 
ſir Wylliam Helman / ſir Thomas Tryuet / &
other / who had in the ſame ſomer ben at the ſiege
with the gauntoiſe before Ipre / Than came
the frenche kyng and cloſed them in / in Burbonoiſe
(as is reherſed here before ī this hyſtorie)
but as than there was truſe bytwene Fraunce / 
Englande / and Flaunders / to endure tyll mydſomer
after / but the ſcottes had moche to do. alſo
there was at London the counſayle of Gaūt / 
and they deſyred to haue a gouernour to helpe
to ſuſtayne the kepyng of their towne: They deſyred
one of the kynges vncles / or els the erle of
Saliſbury. So at this counſayle at London
there were many counſayls / as well for the flē
               mynges
as for Portyngale & Scotlande / who
made thē warre. The duke of Lancaſtre drewe
to that parte that he might haue a nōbre of men
of warre and archers / to go in to Portyngale.
And he ſhewed the lordes / prelatꝭ / and comons / 
howe they were all bounde by faythe and othe / 
to ayde hym and his brother to wynne the herytage
in Caſtell: and that he ſayde / they promyſed
whan the kyng his nephue was crowned. &
it apered by their letters ſealed. and moreouer / 
the duke complayned hym howe they of the realme
dyd hym and his brother wronge / in that
whan his brother therle of Cambridge was in
Portyngale / that they kepte but ſmally the couynaunt
that they had promyſed: For he ſayd / 
it was ꝓmyſed to ſende to hym thider two thouſande
ſpeares and as many archers / & nothyng
was done / Wherby their quarell of the right of
their enherytaunce was greatly hyndred. The
dukes wordes were well harde / as it was reaſon / 
And the mooſt notableſt ꝑſons of yt counſayle
ſaid / howe he had right to ſpeke as he dyd
howe be it they ſayd / that the buſyneſſes of the
realme that touched them nere / muſt firſt be ꝓferred.
Some wolde that his wyll ſhulde haue
ben accomplyſſhed / and ſome other ſaid / that it
ſhulde be a great outrage to ſende out of the realme
two thouſande men of warre & four thouſande
archers / to ſo long a iourney as ī to Portugale / 
for the fortunes of the ſee be daūgerous

and the ayre of Portyngale marueylous hote / 
ſayeng / that if the realme of Englande ſhulde
leſe ſuche a company / it ſhulde be a domage irrecuparable:
Howe be it all thynges alledged / 
finally it was ordayned / that the duke of Lancaſtre
ſhulde paſſe the See with ſeuyn hūdred
ſpeares and four thouſand archers / and euery
man payed for a quarter of a yere. Howe be it
they reſerued / that yf any accydent touchynge
the realme of Englāde by the meanes of Fraū
               ce
or Scotlande / ſhulde happen to falle before
their departure in to Portingale / than to tary.
The duke agreed therto ſythe he ſawe it wolde
be none otherwyſe: And than as ye haue herde
before / whan̄e the duke of Lancaſtre was redy
with all his men at Hampton / to take his voyage
in to Portyngale / & that the ambaſſadurs
were retourned and had brought worde in to
Portyngale / howe the duke of Lancaſtre was
comyng with ſuche a nombre of men of warre / 
Than the portyngalois had great ioye. So it
fortuned than that a lette fell in Englande / whiche
taryed the duke of Lancaſtre for a ſeaſon / 
for the admyrall of Fraunce ſir Iohan of Vien
with a thouſande ſpeares of good men of armes / 
toke ſhippyng at Scluſe and ſayled in to
Scotlande and made warre in to Englande / 
ſo that all the realme came to reſyſt thē. All this
is ſhewed here before in this hyſtorie / wherfore
I nede nat to ſpeke therof agayne / but I wyll
ſpeke of the ſiege of Lixbone and of the kynge
of Spayne / of whome I ſhall make true relacyon / 
accordynge as I was enformed.
            Kynge don Iohan of Caſtell beyng at ſiege
before Lixbone / tidynges came in to his hooſt
by marchauntes of his countrey that came fro
Flaunders / howe the duke of Lancaſtre with a
great nombre of men of warre were comynge
thyderwarde / to reyſe the ſiege the
                  •
               . Theſe tidynges
were well beleued / for the ſpanyardes
knewe well / howe the duke of Lancaſtre wolde
do his payne and dilygence to make warre on
the realme of Caſtell / bycauſe he claymed part
therof by the ryght of his wyfe / howe be it the
kyng helde ſtyll his ſiege / and he had ſent meſſangers
and letters to haue ayde out of Fraūce
and ſpecially he ſent in to the coūtre of Bierne / 
and in to the lande of the erle of Foiz. And out
of Byerne there iſſued in a four dayes reſpyte / 
a thre hundred ſpeares of choſen men of armes
and there was come to Ortaiſe out of the realme
of Fraūce to go into Caſtell to ſerue ye king
there / Sir Iohan of Rue burgonyon / and ſir
Geffray Richon breton / & ſir Geffray de Partenay / 
and eche of thē had a company by them
ſelfe. Than they of Bierne made thē redy / as
the lorde of Lynguaſſhe a great barone / & companyon
to the erle of Foiz / and ſir Peter Lyer / 
ſir Iohan de Lespres / the lorde of Bordes / ſir
Bertrande of Baruge / the lorde of Moriage / 
ſir Raymonde Danſac / ſir Iohn̄ of Salagre / 
ſir Monan of Saruen / ſir Pyer of Robier / ſir
Stephyn of Valentyne / and ſir Raymonde of
Raraſſe / ſir Peter of Hanefan / ſir Ogert of domeſſon / 
and dyuers other. And ſir Eſpayngnolet
of Spaygne eldeſt ſonne to ſir Roger of
Spaygne / coſyn of lygnage and armes to the
erle of Foiz / he went in the company of them of
Bierne. Theſe lordes and knightes of Bierne
made their aſſemble at Ortaiſe and therabout / 
and it was ſhewed me by them that ſawe them
deꝑte fro Ortaiſe. howe that they were the beſt
armed and apoynted company / that wente out
of Byerne many a daye before. And whan the
erle of Foiz ſawe ſurely howe they wolde deꝑte
to go in to Spaygne (thoughe at the begynnynge
he ſomwhat conſented therto / and that
they ſhulde receyue the kyng of Caſtelles wages)
yet he was angry and ſoroufull of their departyng / 
for he ſawe well that his countre was
ſore febled therby. Than he ſent ſir Eſpaygne
de Leon and ſir Cabeſtan to theſe ſayd lordes
knightes and ſquyers / deſyringe them to come
toguyder to his caſtell of Ortaiſe / to the entent
to gyue theym a dyuer to their farewell. The
knightes obeyed as it was reaſon / and came to
Ortaiſe to ſe the erle / who receyued them with
gladde chere / and after maſſe cauſed thē all to
come to him in to his ſecrete chambre / and than
in maner of counſayle he ſaid to them. ſirs / it is
than your ententes to deꝑte out of my countre / 
and to leaue in my handes the warre with the
erle of Armynake / and ye to go & make warre
for the kyng of Spayne. This departure toucheth
me right nere. Sir quod they / we muſte
nedes go / for to that entent we haue receyued ye
kyng of Caſtels wages. And ſir / the warre bytwene
Spayne & Portyngale ones atchyued / 
than we ſhall retourne agayne in ſauegarde. atchyued
ꝙ therle / nay nat ſo ſoone: for as nowe
it dothe but begyn / for there is a newe kynge in
Portyngale / and he hath ſent for ayde in to Englande:
therfore this warre is likely to endure
a long ſeaſon / & ye to kepe the felde / for ye ſhall
nat be fought with / tyll the duke of Lancaſtre
and his cōpany be come thyder: and ſo ye ſhall
derely bye the wages ye haue receyued. Sir ꝙ

they / ſythe we haue done ſo moche we muſt nedes
parforme our voyage. Well god ſpede you
quod the erle / let vs go to dyner it is tyme. and
than therle with theſe lordes and knightꝭ went
in to his hall / and there the tables were. There
they had a great dyner at great leaſer / and was
ſerued with euery thyng that to that day ꝑteyned.
And after dyner therle ledde with hym all
this cōpany in to the galarye / than he entred in
to comunyng with them and ſayd. Fayre lordꝭ
and frendes / it ſhall greue me to ſe your departynge
out of my countre / nat for that I am dyſpleaſed
with your auauncementes & honours / 
for in all caſes I wolde gladly augment and exalte
your honours & profyte: But I haue great
pytie of you / for ye are the chefe flour of chiualry
of my countre of Bierne. and ye thus to go
in to a ſtraunge countre / I wolde coūſayle you
yet agayne to leaue this voyage / and to let the
kynge of Caſtell and the kynge of Portyngale
make their warre bytwene theym ſelfe / for ye
are nat bounde none otherwyſe. Sir ꝙ they / 
ſauynge your diſpleaſure / we can nat do thus.
And ſir / ye knowe more than ye ſpeke of. We haue
taken wages and gyftes of the kyng of Caſtell / 
wherfore we muſt nedes deſerue it. Well
quod therle yeſpeke well / but I ſhall ſhewe you
what ſhall come of this vyage: Outher ye ſhall
retourne ſo poore and ſo naked that lyfe ſhall
ſtrāgle you / or els ye ſhalbe all ſlayne or taken.
The knightes began to laughe and ſayd. Sir
we muſt abyde the aduenture. Than therle fell
in other talkyng and lefte that in reſt / and that
than he ſhewed them in maner of communycaſion / 
all the nature of the Spanyardes / howe
they be ſluttyſſhe and louſy / and enuyous of other
mennes welthe. Wherfore quod he / I reed
you take good counſayle / and than he demaunded
for wyne and ſpyce / and he made euery mā
drinke: and than toke euery man by the hande
and badde them farewell / and departed fro thē
and went in to his chambre. And at the fote of
the caſtell the knightes moūted on their horſes
and ſo rode to Sanetere / and the
                  •
                lodged that
night. And the nexte day they departed and entred
in to the lande of Baſeles & toke the waye
to Panpylone / and they paſſed ſurely / for they
payed truely for all that they tooke. And in the
ſame ſeaſon whyle the kyng laye in Lixbone / &
had layen there the ſpace of a yere: Than they
of the towne of ſaynt yrayne rebelled agaynſt ye
kyng of Caſtell / and cloſed their gates & ſayde.
that nother French nor ſpayniſſhe ſhulde entre
in to their towne / bycauſe of the domage that
they had done to them / and oppreſſyons. And
ſome ſayd / it was in the faute of Geffray Rycous
company and ſir Parteney / who had a cō
               pany
of bretons / who toke euer that they might
gette / for they ſet nothyng by peace. Than the
cytezins toke the two caſtelles & ſayd / how they
wolde kepe them and their towne agaynſt all ꝑſons
that wolde do thē any hurte. and the ſame
day that they rebelled / they ſlewe mo than threſcore
bretons / and had nere ſlayne ſir Geffray
Partenay / but that he ſaued hym ſelfe vnder ye
walles of the towne yt were nere his lodgynge.
Than the frenchmen & bretons that were there
fierſly aſſauted them of ſaynt yrayne / but they
loſt more than they wonne / and ſo dyd nothynge.
Theſe tidynges came in to the hooſt to the
kyng of Caſtell / howe that they of ſaynt yrayn
were tourued portyngalois / & howe they were
in mynde to delyuer the towne and caſtelles to
the kyng of Portyngale. Of whiche newes the
kynge was nat content / and called to hym his
marſhall ſir Raynolde Lymoſin and ſaid. take
a hundred or two hundred ſpeares & go to ſaīt
yrayne / and knowe why the men of the towne
do rebell / and what occaſion they haue to do as
they haue done. So the marſhall rode forthe &
with hym a two hundred ſpeares and came to
ſaynt yrayne: & he ſent before hym an haraulde
to ſhewe them of his comyng / & howe he wolde
ſpeke with them at the barryers / and ſo he dyde
his meſſage: and it was anſwered hym by thē
of the towne / ſayeng. Sir haralde / we knowe
right well / Sir Raynolde Lymoſin is a gentylman
and a valyant knight / and is marſhall
with the kyng / he may rightwell come hyder if
it pleaſe hym vnarmed in to the towne / or els
nat. This was all the meſſage that the haralde
brought to his mayſter. Than̄e ſir Raynolde
ſayd / I am nat come hyder to do thē any domage / 
but to knowe their ententes. It is all one to
me to entre armed or vnarmed / to knowe their
wylles. And ſo he and ſixe with hym rode thyder
vnarmed / and lefte all his cōpany behynde
hym: and ſo he a lyghted before the barryers / &
whan they within ſawe him in that eſtate / they
opyned the gate & receyued him in to the towne
and made hym good chere / and than he aſſembled
the people in the market place and ſayde.
Sirs / all ye that dwell in this towne take hede
what I ſaye. I am ſente hyder by the kynge of
Caſtell to demaunde of you / for what entēcion
ye do rebell & cloſe your gates / and haue ſlayne
of them that be come hyder to ſerue the kynge.
Knowe for trouthe / the kyng is ſore diſpleaſed

with you / and alſo he is enfourmed / howe that
ye haue taken in poſſeſſyon the two caſtelles of
this towne / whiche parteyneth to his enherytaunce / 
and howe that ye wyll delyuer them to
his aduerſary the kyng of Portyngale. Than
they aunſwered and ſayd. Sir Raynolde / ſauynge
the kynges grace we are nat ſo diſpoſed
nor to rendre them to any mannes handes / but
to our kynge. The kynge of Caſtell of whome
we holde them / ſo that he gouerne vs in peace &
iuſtice and yt we do or haue done / was in ye faut
of theſe robbers and pyllers the bretons / who
were lodged in this towne / for yf we had been
ſarazyns or worſe people / we coulde nat haue
ben worſe dalte withall than we were. as in rauyſſhinge
of our wyues and doughters breakynge
vp our coffers / and breakynge out of the
heedes of our veſſelles of wyne / beatynge and
meamynge of vs / whan we ſpeke any worde to
them. Therfore it can nat be marueyled (whan
we ſawe theſe outrages done to vs and to ours
by thē that ſhulde defende vs) though we were
diſpleaſed. Men wyll be diſpleaſed for leſſe cauſe.
Sir / ye maye ſhewe all this if it pleaſe you / 
for we be of one accorde: that whoſoeuer come / 
we wyll receyue in to our towne nother frenche
nor breton / nor none but the kynges owne perſone / 
with ſuche as ſhall pleaſe hym / ſo that we
be nat traueyled nor putte to vyolence. Whan̄e
ſir Raynolde herde them ſaye ſo / he was a peaſed:
for it ſemed to hym / that they dyd no wronge
to putte out of their towne their enemyes / &
than he ſayde. O ye good people / I haue well
herde you and well vnderſtande you. ye ſhall
abyde in peace / and I wyll retourne to the kynge / 
and ſhewe hym all that ye haue ſayd / and in
good faythe I ſhall do for you as moche as in
me is poſſyble to do. Sir we thanke you quod
they / and we truſt in you that if the kyng haue
any yuell informacyon of vs / yt ye wyll be oure
good meane. And than ſir Raynolde tooke his
leaue and departed and retourned to his company / 
who abode for hym in the feldes. And ſo
he rode tyll he came to the hooſt before Lixbone
and lyghted at his lodgynge / and went to the
kynge and ſhewed hym all that he hadde harde
and founde with thē of yrayne. Whan the kyng
knewe the trouthe he ſayd: By my faythe they
haue done wiſely / for no man can be ſure of thes
robbets.
            And whan ſir Geffray Richone and ſir Geffray
Partenay & their companyes / ſawe howe
they coulde haue none other remedy of them of
ſaynt yrayne / and that the kynge of Caſtell diſſymuled
with them: They were ſore diſpleaſed
and ſayd among them ſelfe. We haue well lefte

bretons ſore manaſſhed them of ſaynt yrayne / 
and maketh their auaunte / that the Gaſcoyns

hundred ſpeares of good men of warre. Wherof
they kynge was ioyfull / and wolde nat that
they ſhulde fynde the coūtre in trouble at their
comynge. And alſo moche of his people deſyred
to refreſſhe theym / for there they had layen
longe / and nothynge done. Than it was commaunded
euery man to diſlodge / and to drawe
towarde ſaynt yrayne. Than the ſpanyardes
dyſlodged and all other / and ſo came in to the
marcheſſe of ſaynt yrayne. Whan they of ſaint
yrayne knewe howe the kynge of Caſtell was
comyng towarde their towne / They ordayned
twelfe men / the moſt notableſt perſons of their

and rode tyll they came where the kyng was to

hym / for the great heate that was than:
And this was a two leages fro ſaynt yrayne. &
there was ſir Raynolde Lymoſin marſhall of

downe / and

            ¶Of the marueylous batayle that
was at Iuberoth / bytwene the kynge
of Caſtell and kyng Iohn̄ of Portyngale
Cap. xxxiii.
            
               WHyle the kynge of Caſtell
was at ſaīt yrayns / the
                  •
               
come to hym the gaſcons of
Bierne with a fayre cōpany
ſir Raynolde Lymoſin rode
to receyue them and welcomed
them ryght ſwetely / as
he that coulde right well do it / and brought thē
to the kyng / who had great ioye of their comynge / 
and cōmaunded ſir Raynolde Lymoſin to
ſe them well lodged at their eaſe / and he dyde ſo
that they were contented. Thus theſe buſyneſſes
reſted / & the kyng laye ſtyll at ſaynt yrayns
and his people there about. The kynge of Caſtell
hadde as than abrode lodged in the feldes
and therabout / a four thouſande men of armes
and .xxx. thouſande of other. And on a daye he
called the barones of Fraunce to counſayle to
knowe their myndes / howe he ſhulde mētayne

forthe his warre / for he had layen at great coſt
before Li
                  •
               bone and had done nothynge. And
ſurely if the gaſcoins had nat come and encoraged
the kynge / he had deꝑted fro ſaynt yrayns
and gone outher to Bergus or into Galice / for
his people were ſore anoyed to lye ſo longe in ye
feldes. Whan the knyghtes of Fraunce and of
Bierne were come before the kynge / he ſayde.
Fayre ſirs / ye be all good men of warre / wherfore
I wolde haue your coūſayle / howe I may
maynteyne my warre agaynſt the lyxbonoyes
and portyngaloyes / that haue kepte me here in
the felde a yere / and yet I haue done nothynge
to them. I had thought to haue gotte them out
of Lixbone to haue fought with them / but they
wolde in no wyſe iſſue out / wherfore my people
gyue me counſayle / to gyue euery man leaue to
departe to their owne houſes / wherfore I pray
you gyue me youre aduyſe. The knyghtes of
Fraunce and of Byerne who were but newely
come / and deſyred armes / and as than had nothynge
done / thynking to deſerue their wages
that they had receyued / aunſwered and ſayde.
Sir / ye be a puyſſant man of landes / and lytell
coſteth you the payne and traueyle of your
people / and ſpecially ſithe they be in their owne
countrey. We wolde nat ſaye ſo moche yf they
were in a ſtraunge countre clene without prouyſion / 
but as nowe we ſaye / they ought nat to
gyue you any ſuche counſayle / for they be here
in as great eaſe / as we ſe / as though they were
at home. Sir / we ſaye to you nat in maner of a
determynate coūſayle / for ye are wyſe ynough
but we thynke by your highe prudence / the beſt
were to chuſe / as yet to kepe the felde. ye maye
well kepe it tyll the feeſt of ſaint Michaell / and
paraduēture by that tyme your enemyes wyll
aſſemble togyder and drawe out in to the felde
whan ye take leeſt hede therto / and ſo thā without
fayle they ſhalbe fought withall. Sir / we
haue great deſyre to wyn ſōwhat / for this iourney
hath coſt vs moche / and great payne & traueyle / 
bothe to our ſelf and to our horſes / or we
came in to this coūtre. Therfore ſir / it ſhall nat
be the opinyon of our company thus to departe
agayne. By my faithe quod the kyng / ye ſpeke
well and truely. In this warre & other / I ſhall
vſe fro henſ forthe after your counſayle: for the
kyng my father & I alſo / haue founde alwayes
in youre countreis great trouthe and faythfulneſſe.
And god haue mercy of ſir Bertram of
Cleſquyes ſoule / for he was a true knyght / by
whome in his tyme we had many recoueraunſes / 
and good iourneys.
            THe wordes and counſails that the kyng
had of them of Fraunce and of Bierne / 
were anone knowen among the lordes & knightes
of Spaygne / wherwith they were ſore diſpleaſed
/ for two cauſes. One / bycauſe it ſemed
to them / that their kyng had more truſt and cō
               fydence
in ſtraungers / than in them who were
his liege men / and had crowned hym kyng. the
ſeconde was / in that they of Fraunce counſayled
the kyng to kepe ſtyll his warre / and they felyng
them ſelfe ſo wery of the warre: & ſo ſpake
among them ſelfe in dyuers maners / nat openlye
but priuely. They wolde ſaye the kyng coude
make no warre but by the frenchmen / and in
lykewiſe no more coude his father. ſo they had
great enuy at the frenche men / whiche well appered:
For whan the frēche varlettes went out
a forragyng / if the ſpayniſſhe forrengers were
ſtronger / than they wolde take their forage fro
them and beate them and mayme them / ſo that
complayntes came therof to the kynge / and he
blamed therfore his marſhall ſir Raynolde Lymoſyn
/ and ſayde. Why haue ye nat prouyded
for this mater? The marſhall excuſed hym and
ſayde: As god might helpe hym / he knewe nothynge
therof / and that he wolde prouyde a remedy
fro thenſ forthe. Incontynent he ſtablyſſhed
men of armes to kepe the feldes / that the
frenche forrēgers rode at their ſuretie / and alſo
he made a crye and a cōmaundement / that euery
man that had any vitayle or prouiſion to ſell
that they ſhulde bringe it to the felde before ſaīt
yrayns / and they ſhuld haue a priſe reaſonable
for euery thyng. So than the ſtraungers had
largely their parte / for the kyng ordayned
that they ſhulde be ſerued before all
other / wherof the ſpanyardes
had great diſpyte.
            So it was the ſame weke / that the kyng of
Caſtell departed fro the ſiege of Lixbone: thre
great ſhyppes of men of warre and Englyſſhe
archers aryued at Lixbone / they were to the nō
               bre
of fyue hundred one & other: And the thirde
parte of them were of the cōpanyons aduenturers / 
hauyng no wages of no man. ſome were
of Calys / of Chierburge / of Breſt in Bretayne
of Mortaygne in Poytou: They had herde of
the warre bytwene Caſtell and Portyngale / &
they came to Burdeux and ther aſſembled and
ſayd. Let vs go at aduenture in to Portyngale
we ſhall fynde them there that wyll receyue vs
and ſette vs awarke. Sir Iohan Harpedan / 

who as than was marſhall of Burdeux / counſayled
thē greatly therto / for he wolde nat they
ſhulde abyde in burdeloys / for they might ther
haue done more hurte than good / bycauſe they
were companyons aduenturers / and had nothyng
to leſe. Of them that arryued at Lixbon
I can nat name all. There were thre ſquyers
englyſſhe that were their capitayns: One was
called Northbery / and another Morbery / and
the thirde Huguelyn of Harcerell. And there
were none of them paſte the age of fyftie yere / 
and good men of armes / & well vſed in the feates
of war
                  •
               . Of the comyng of theſe Englyſſhe
men they of Lixbone were right gladde / and ſo
was the kyng of Portyngale who wolde ſe thē
and ſo they went to the palays where the kyng
was / who made them great chere: And demaū
               ded
of them / if the duke of Lancaſtre had ſent
them thyder. Sir quod Northbery / it is a longe
ſeaſon ſythe he had any knowledge of vs or
we of hym. Sir / we be men of dyuers ſortes / 
ſekynge for aduentures / here be ſome are come
to ſerue you fro the towne of Calays. By my
faythe quod the kynge / you and they bothe are
right hartely welcome / your comyng dothe me
great good and ioye / and ſhortely I ſhall ſette
you a warke. We haue ben here incloſed a gret
ſeaſon / ſo that we be wery therof / but nowe we
wyll be at large in the felde / as well as our enemyes
hath been. Sir quod they / we deſyre nothynge
els: and ſir / we deſyre you that ſhortely
we maye ſe youre enemyes. The kynge made
them a dyner in his palays at Lixbone / and cō
               maunded
that they ſhulde all be lodged in the
cytie at their eaſe / and to be payed for their wages
for thre monethes. Than the kyng ſet his
clerkes awarke and made letters / and ſente thē
ouer all his realme / cōmaundynge euery man
able to beare harneſſe to drawe to Lixbone.
            ALl ſuche as theſe letters came vnto obeyed
nat / for many abode ſtyll ī their
houſes / for thre partes of the Realme
diſſymuled with the kynge / and with theym of
Lixbone / bycauſe they had crowned kynge / a
baſtarde / and ſpake great wordꝭ ther agaynſt
priuely: And bycauſe of the great trouble and
dyfferēce that the kynge of Caſtell and his coū
               ſayle
ſawe in the realme of Portyngale / made
hym to auaunce hym ſelfe / to the entent to haue
conquered the countre: Sayenge / howe all
ſhulde be wonne with one dayes iourney of batayle / 
and that yf they of Lixbone might be ouerthrowen / 
the reſydue of the countrey wolde
nat be ſorie of it / but put out of the realme that
mayſter Denyce / or elles ſlee hym / and than it
ſhulde be a lande of conqueſt for hym / for his
wyfe was ryght enherytoure. yet with a good
wyll kynge Iohan of Caſtell wolde haue lefte
the warre / but his people wolde nat ſuffre him
for they euer gaue hym corage: Sayeng / how
his quarell and cauſe was iuſte. And whan the
kynge of Portyngale ſawe that his commaundement
was nat obſerued / and that moche of
his people diſobeyed to 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
               ue hym / he was right
penſyue and malencolyous: He called to hym
ſuche as he truſted beſt of Lixbone / and of the
knyghtes of his houſe / who dyde their payne
to crowne hym / and alſo they had ſerued kyng
Ferant: As ſir Iohan Radygos and ſir Iohn̄
Teatedore: the lorde of Siegere / and ſir Gō
               me
of Tabeſton / Ambriſe Condricho and Peter
his brother / 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Ouges of Nauaret a knyght
of Caſtell / who was tourned Portyngaloyes / 
for kynge Iohan hadde chaſed hym out of his
realme / and the kynge of Portyngale hadde reteyned
hym and made hym a chiefe capitayne.
At this counſayle the kyng ſhewed many thynges
and ſayde. Sirs / ye that be here I knowe
well ye be my frēdes / for ye haue made me kynge.
Beholde nowe / howe dyuers folkes of my
realme excuſeth them ſelfe / ſo that I canne nat
gette them to the felde / for yf they had as good
wyll to fight with oure enemyes / as I haue / I
wolde be right gladde therof / but they be nat ſo
dyſpoſed: I ſe howe they refrayne and dyſſymule
the mater / wherfore I haue nede of counſayle
on this mater / howe I maye order myſelfe:
and therfore I praye you lette me haue your
aduiſe. Than ſir Gōme of Tabeſton a knight
of Portyngale ſayde. Sir / I counſayle you
for youre honoure / that as ſoone as ye maye / 
drawe your ſelfe and all youre people in to the
felde / and aduenture you and we alſo / and we
ſhall ayde you to dye in the quarell / for ye be
our kynge / And if there be any in Portyngale
rebelles and diſdaynfull to ſerue you. I ſaye
and ſo ſaythe dyuers of this towne / that it is
bycauſe ye haue nat iſſued oute to ſhewe youre
face agaynſt your enemyes. ye haue the grace
as yet to be reputed a valyaunt man in armes:
and they ſaye / that nowe at nede your valyantneſſe
fayleth you. This it is that hath ſet your
enemyes in pride / and hath cooled your ſubiectes / 
For if they ſawe in you dedes of valure &
of prowes / they wolde obey and dout you / & ſo
wolde do yo
                  •
                enemyes. by my heed ꝙ the king
ye ſay well / and ſo it is. wherfore ſir I wyll incontynent / 

that euery man make hym redy
                  •
                for
we wyll ryde out ſhortely and loke on our enemyes / 
outher we wyll wyn all at this tyme or
leſe all. Sir quod the knyght / it ſhalbe done:
for if the iourney be yours / and god ſende you
good fortune / ye ſhall be kynge of Portyngale
for euer / and ye ſhall be prayſed in all ſtraunge
realmes / where as the knowledge therof ſhall
come. and to the parfyte herytage of Portyngale
ye can nat attayne / but by batayle. ye may
take enſample of kyng don Henry your coſyn / 
father to kyng Iohan that nowe is kyng of Caſtell / 
of Spaygne / of Tolle
                  •
                / of Galyce / of Corduane / 
and of Sibyle. He came to all theſe herytagꝭ
by batayle / otherwyſe he had neuer had
them. For ye knowe howe the puiſſaunce of the
prince of Wales and of Acquitayne put kynge
don Peter yo
                  •
                coſyn in to poſſeſſion o
                  •
                all theſe
herytages and landes cloſed within Spayne / 
and afterwarde by a iourney of batayle yt don
Henry had at Nauntuell agaynſt don Peter / 
who there loſte all agayne / and don Henry put
in poſſeſſion as he was before / at whiche iourney
he aduentured hymſelfe and his / or els he
had nat ben kyng ther. In lykewiſe ſir ye muſt
aduenture if ye thynke to lyue with honour. ſir
quod the kynge ye ſaye true / I wyll haue none
other counſayle but this / for this is profytable
for vs.
            THus departed that counſayle / & than
it was ordayned yt within thre dayes / 
euery man ſhulde drawe in to the feldꝭ
and there to take ſome grounde to abyde their
enemyes. Thoſe thre dayes they kepte the gates
ſo cloſe of Lixbone / that nother man nor woman
coude iſſue out / for they wolde nat yt their
enemyes ſhulde be preuy of their entenſyon. &
whan the Englyſſhmen that were there vnderſtode
that they ſhulde iſſue oute and drawe towardes
ſaynt yrayns to loke on their enemyes / 
they were ioyfull. Than euery man made hym
redy / and the archers dreſſed redy their bowes
and arowes and all other / in euery thynge that
they neded. And on a thurſdaye they departed
out of Lixbone / and that day they lodged by a
lytell riuer ſyde a two leages fro Lixbone / with
their faces towarde ſaynt yrayns. And euery
man ſayde with good herte and wyll / that they
wolde neuer retourne to Lixbone / tyll they had
ſene their enemyes: Saye
                  •
               g / howe it was better
for them that they ſhulde go and requyre batayle
of their enemyes / rather than they ſhulde
come on them. For they ſaid / they had ſene and
herde dyuers enſamples of requyrers and nat
requyrers: and euer of fyue / foure hath optayned / 
and in a maner all the vyctories that the englyſſhmen
haue had in Fraūce / they were euer
the requyrers. For naturally the ſecars for batayle
are more ſtrongar and couragyous in aſſaylinge / 
than the defendars be. Of this opynyon
they were nere all and ſome of the burgeſſes
of Lixbone ſayde. We were at Bruges in
Flaūders whan the gauntoyſe came before the
towne / and requyred batayle agaynſt the Erle
of Flaunders / and all his puiſſaunce. And we
knowe well that Philyppe Dartuell / Petre de
Boyſe / Iohan Clyquetiell / Fraūces Atreman
and Peter le Myttier / who as than were capitayns
of the gauntoyſe. They brought oute of
Gaunte no mo but ſeuyn thouſande men / & yet
they requyred batayle of their enemyes / & ouer
came and diſconfyted a .xi. thouſande. This is
true / and this was without any treaſon / but by
clene fortune of batayle. This was done on a
ſaturdaye a leage fro Bruges / as we herde reported
the nexte day whan they had wonne the
towne of Bruges. So thus they dyde putte in
aduenture / outher to wynne or to leſe: and thus
muſt we do if we thynke to haue any good ſpede.
Thus theſe lixbonoyſe that thurſday ſpake
one to another: and whan the kyng was enformed
of their wordes and of their great confort
he had great ioye.
            
               ANd on the Friday in the mornynge / 
they ſowned their trumpettes
and made them redy / and toke the
waye on the right hāde folowyng
the ryuer and the playne countre / 
for their caryage that folowed them / & ſo rode
that daye four leages. That day tidynges cāe
to the kynge of Caſtell where he laye at ſaynte
yrayns / that the Portyngalois and the Lixbonoyes
were cōmyng towardes hym. Theſe tidynges
anone were ſpredde abrode in the hoſt / 
wherof the Spaygniardes / Frenche men / and
gaſcoyns had great ioye / and ſayde: Beholde
yonder Lixbonoyes be valyant men / ſithe they
come to ſeke for batayle. Shortely let vs go in
to the feldes / and lette vs cloſe them among vs
and we waye / to the entent that they retourne
nat agayne. Than̄e it was ordayned and publyſſhed
in the hooſt / that euery man the Saturdaye
in the mornynge a foote and a horſebacke / 
ſhuld iſſue out of ſaynt yrayns / & drawe
towardes their ennemyes to fyght with them / 
euery man made hym redy and were ioyfull of

that iourney. And on the ſaturday in the mornynge
they ſowned their trumpettes: And the
kynge herde maſſe in the caſtell and drāke / and
than lepte on his horſe / & euery man with hym / 
and ſo drewe in to the felde / in good aray of batayle.
Sir Raynolde Limoſin marſhall of the
hooſt formaſt / and he ſente forthe ſcurrers to aduyſe
the dealynge of their ennemyes / and to ſe
where they were / and what nombre they were
of: and the frenchmen ſente forthe two ſquyers
one a Burgonion and the other a Gaſcone. the
burgonyon was called Wylliam of Mōtigny / 
and he was there with ſir Iohan of Rey: and
they of Gaſcoyne and Bierne ſent forthe Bertrande
of Barge / and they were bothe the ſame
day made knightes. And with them rode forth
a Chatellayne of Caſtell a good man of armes
called Peter Ferant of Medyne. He was on a
marueylous light Genet. and whyle theſe thre
rode forthe to aduyſe their enemyes / ye reſydue
of the hooſt rode a ſofte paſe / and they were in
nombre two thouſande ſpeares knyghtes and
ſquiers / Gaſcoyns / Burgonyons / Frenchmen
Picardes / and Bretons: aſ well apoynted and
armed as any men might be / and a twētie thouſande
ſpanyardes all a horſbacke / they had nat
rydden forthe a vowe ſhotte but they ſtode ſtyll
On the other ſyde the kynge of Portyngale in
lykewiſe had ſent forthe thre ſcurrers to a vieu
iuſtely the demeanyng of the ſpaniardes / wherof
two of them were Englyſſhe ſquyers / expert
men of armes / one called Iaquyne Dartebery
and the other Philippe Barqueſton / and with
them Ferrant de la Groſſe of Portingale. they
were all well horſed & rode forthe tyll they came
to a lytell hyll / and there they might well ſe the
behauynge of the ſpanyardes. Than they retourned
to the kynge of Portyngale and to his
counſayle / and ther made relacyon of that they
had done / and ſayd. Sir / we haue ben ſo farre
forwarde that we haue ſene your enemyes. ſir / 
ſurely they be a great nombre / they are welle a
thyrtie thouſāde horſe. Therfore ſir / take your
aduyſe. than the kyng demaunded if they rode
all in one batayle or nat. Sir quod they / ſutelye
they be in two batayls. Than the kyng turned
hym towarde his people / and ſayd a loude
Sirs / nowe aduyſe you well / for there nedeth
nowe no cowardneſſe / for we ſhall fight ſhortelye / 
for our enemyes be comyng / and hath gret
deſyre to fynde vs. and ſo they ſhall / for we can
nat flye nor retourne: We are iſſued out of Lixbone
a great nombre of people. Thynke ſirs to
do well / and lette vs ſelle our lyues dere. ye haue
made me kyng. This daye ſhall I ſe yf the
crowne of Portyngale wyll abyde with me peaſably
or nat. And ſirs / of one thyng be yeſure / 
I ſhall nat flye / but abyde the aduenture with
you: than they all anſwered / with a good wyll
ſo be it / and we ſhall all abyde with you. Than
the Englyſſhe capitayns were called forthe / as
Northbery and Hartefell / and other of thē that
were mooſt experte in armes. The kynge demaunded
of them what counſayle they wolde
gyue hym: howe to abyde the aduenture of the
batayle. for he ſayd / he knewe well they muſt nedes
fyght / for his enemyes aproched faſte / and
they be in nombre four agaynſt one of vs. than
the Englyſſhmen ſayd. Sir / ſithe we ſhall haue
bataile / and that they be greatter in nombre
than we be / wherfore it is a harde ꝑtie / we can
nat cōquere / without we take ſome aduaūtage
of ſome hedges or buſſhes. Lette vs take ſuche
a groūde as we may fortify / and that they ſhall
nat entre vpon vs ſo lightely / as they ſhulde do
on the playne felde. Sirs quod the kynge / ye
ſpeke wyſely / and it ſhalbe as ye haue deuyſed.
            On this counſayle of the Englyſſhmen / the
kyng reſted and ther toke aduyſe what groūde
they might take: and nat farre of fro them was
the towne of Iuberothe a great vyllage. Thyder
the Lixbonoyes had ſent all their prouiſion
ſomers and caryages: For it was their entenſion
that night to lodge there / wheder they had
batayle or no / if they might ſcape with honour
And without the towne a quarter of a leage or
therabout / ther was a great abbey of monkes
whyder they of Iuberothe and of other vyllages
were wonte to come to here maſſe. And the
churche ſtandeth a lytell oute of the waye in a
moote / enuyroned about with great trees / hedges / 
and buſſhes: it was a ſtronge place with a
lytell helpe. Than the Englyſſhmen were called
to counſayle to the kynge / for thoughe they
were but fewe / yet the kynge wolde folowe moche
their aduyſe: Than̄e they ſayde. Sir / we
knowe hereby a place / the mynſter without Iuberoth
among the trees / it ſtandeth in a ſtronge
place / with a lytell amendement and helpe.
and ſuche as knewe the countre ſayd. ſir / it is
true. Than the kyng ſayd / let vs drawe thyder
and let vs order there our ſelfe / as men of warr
ought to do / ſo that whan oure enemyes come / 
let thē nat fynde vs vn ꝓuided. incōtynēt it was
done / & ſo they came wher as the churche was.
Than whan the Englyſſhe men and ſir Monges
of Naueret / and dyuers other valyāt men

of Portugale and of Lixbone / had well aduyſed
the place roūde about: they ſayd. This place
is ſtronge ynough with a lytell helpe / ſo that
we maye here abyde the aduenture. Than on
the ſyde nexte the feldes they cutte downe the
trees and layde them one ouer another / to thentente
that horſemen ſhulde nat come with full
courſe on them / They lafte one waye open nat
very large / and ſuche archers and croſ bowes
as they had / they ſette them on euery ſyde of the
waye / & their men of armes all a fote in a playne
within the way / and the churche on their one
ſyde / and ther was the kyngꝭ baners pight vp.
And whan they had thus ordered euery thynge
they were in great ioye & ſayd. That if it pleaſed
god they were well / and in ſuche a place to
kepe longe / and to make a good iourney. than
the kynge ſayd. Fayre ſirs / this day euery man
do his parte and thynke nat to flye / for that can
nat aueyle vs. We are farr of fro Lixbone / and
alſo in the chaſe ther is no recoueryng / for thre
wyll ſlee and beate downe .xii. that be flyenge.
Therfore ſhewe this daye that ye be men of prowes / 
and ſelle derely your lyues / and ymagyn
in your ſelfe / howe the iourney ſhalbe ours / as
it ſhalbe if god be pleaſed / and than ſhall we be
moche honoured and ſpoken of in ſtraūge countreis / 
where as the tidynges ſhall come / for alwayes
the victours be exalted / and they that be
diſconfyted diſprayſed. & ſirs / thynke howe ye
haue made me kynge / wherfore ye ought to be
the more hardy & coragyous. And of one thyng
be ye ſure / that as long as this axe endureth in
my hādes I ſhall fight / and if it fayle orbreke I
ſhall get another / & ſhewe my ſelfe / that I wyll
mentayne & defende the crowne of Portyngale
for my ſelfe / and for the right that I haue by ſucceſſyon
of my brother / the whiche I take on my
ſoule that myne enemyes traueyleth me wrong
fully / and that the quarell is myne.
            Than all ſuche as harde the kynge ſayd / ſir
of your grace and mercy / ye admoneſt vs wyſelye.
And ſir / we ſhall helpe to ayde and maynteyne
that we haue gyuen you / whiche is your
owne. Sir / we ſhall all abyde with you here in
this ſame place / and ſhall nat departe / without
god departe vs. Sir / make a crye to all youre
people / for euery man hath nat herde you ſpeke
cōmaundyng on payne of dethe no man to flye
And ſir / if there be any that are faynt harted to
abyde the batayle / let them come forthe / & gyue
thē leaue to departe fro the other / for one faynt
harte may dyſcourage two doſyn of good men
or els ſtryke of their heedes in your preſens / to
gyue enſample to other. The kyng anſwered / 
I wyll it be ſo. Than there were two knightes
ordayned to go and ſertche euery cōpany / and
to demaunde if any were abaſſhed to abyde the
batayle. The meſſangers reported to the kyng
whan they retourned / that they coude fynde no
man but that was redy to abyde the aduenture
of batayle. It is ſo moche the better quod the
kyng. Than the kyng cauſed all that wolde be
made knightes to come before hym / & he wolde
gyue them the order of knighthod / in the name
of god & of ſaynt George. and as I vnderſtāde
ther were made a threſcore newe knightꝭ / wherof
the kyng had great ioye / and dyd ſette them
in the front of the batayle / and ſayd to thē. ſirs
the order of knighthode is as noble and highe / 
as any herte can thynke. and there is no knight
that ought to be a cowarde nor ſhamefull / but
ought to be fierſe and hardy as a lyon / whā his
helme is on his heed and ſeyth his ennemyes. &
bycauſe I wolde ye ſhulde this day ſhewe prowes
/ wher it ought to be ſhewed: therfore I ordayne
you in the firſt front of the bataile. & ſirs
do ſo that we maye haue honour and you alſo / 
otherwyſe your ſpurres are but yuell ſet on. &
euery knight anſwered as his tourne fell / as he
paſſed by the kynge. Sir / with the pleaſure of
god we ſhall ſo do / to haue your grace and loue
Thus the portyng alois ordred them ſelfe / and
fortifyed them beſyde the churche of Iuberoth
in Portyngale. That daye there was no Engliſſhman
that wolde be made knight / yet they
were deſyred of the kyng and other / but they excuſed
them ſelfe for that day.
         
         
            ¶Of the ſpanyardes / howe they ordered
them ſelfe and their
batayle. Cap. xxxiiii.
            
               NOwe let vs retourne
to the kynge don Iohan of
Caſtell / and of the knyghtꝭ
and ſquyers of Fraūce and
of Gaſcone / who were ther
with him: And ſuch as they
had ſent to aduyſe their enemyes / 
retourned agayne and ſayd. Sir kyng / 
and ye lordes and knightes here preſent / we haue
rydded ſo forwarde / that we haue ſene oure
enemyes. And accordyng as we can iuge / they
be nat paſte ten thouſande men in all / one and

other / and they be about the mynſter of Iuberothe
/ and ther they be reſted and ſette in order
of batayle / and there they ſhall be founde / who
ſoeuer wyll ſeke for them. Than the kyng called
to hym his counſayle / and ſpecially the barons
and knightes of Fraunce / and demaūded
of them what was beſt to do: They anſwered
and ſayd. Sir / we thynke it were beſt let them
be fought with all incontynent / we ſe nothyng
elles. For by that is reported / they be a frayed &
in great doute / bycauſe they be ſo farre of fro
any fortreſſe. Lixbone is farre of a ſixe leages / 
they can nat ronne thyder with their eaſe / but
they ſhalbe ouertaken by ye waye / without they
take the aduaūtage of the night. Therfore ſir / 
we counſayle ſithe ye knowe where they be / order
your batayls and go and fyght with them / 
whyle your people be of good wyll to do well.
Than the kyng demaunded of thē of his owne
countre their opinyons / as of ſir Dangonyes
Mendant / ſir Dygo Parſement / Pier Gouſſart
of Moūtdaſque / and Pier Ferrant of Valeſque / 
and of the great mayſter of Caletrane:
They anſwered the kynge and ſayd. Sir / we
haue well harde the knightes of Fraunce / howe
they wolde haue you hotely to ſette on your enemyes.
Sir / we wyll that ye knowe and they alſo / 
that are we can come to thē it wyll be nyght / 
for ye ſe the ſonne draweth downe warde / and
as yet ye haue nat ordred youre batayls. Sir / 
therfore we thynke it were good ye taryed tyll
the mornynge / and lette vs drawe ſo nere them
and laye ſo good ſpyall in dyuers places / that if
they wolde diſlodge aboute mydnight and departe / 
than lette vs alſo dyſlodge / for they can
nat flye nor ſcape vs / the countre is ſo playne. &
there is no place to hyde them by Lixbone / whiche
we can nat gette with our eaſe. ſir this counſayle
we gyne you. Than the kyng ſtode ſtyll a
lytell and caſte downe his loke to the erthe / and
after he tourned his regarde on the ſtraūgers.
Thā the marſhall ſir Raynolde Lymoſin ſayd
to pleaſe the frēchmen / in the langage of Spaygne / 
to the entent he might the better be vnderſtande
of euery man: and ſo turned hym to the
ſpanyardes / ſuche as had gyuen the kyng that
counſayle / Sayeng and callyng euery man by
his name. ſirs / howe can ye be more ſage in batayls
or more vſed in armes / than theſe valyant
knightes be that be here preſent? Howe can ye
deuyſe any thyng beyond them / that ſhulde be
of any valure? for they haue done nothyng els
all their life dayes / but traueyll fro realme to realme
to fynde and to do dedes of armes. Howe
can you or durſt you deuiſe any thyng agaynſt
their wordes / whiche are ſo noble and ſo highe
for to kepe the honour of the kyng and of his realme / 
wherin ye haue greatter parte than they?
For ye haue there your herytages and your bodyes / 
and they haue nothyng there but nowe al
onely their bodyes / whiche they wyll firſte and
formaſt put in aduenture: and ſo they haue deſyred
of the kyng to haue the firſt batayle / and
the kyng hath graunted them. Than regarde
their great and noble courage / whan they wyll
firſt of all aduenture thē ſelfe for you. It ſhulde
ſeme that ye haue enuy at them / & that ye wolde
that profyte nor honoure ſhulde come to them / 
whiche ye ought nat to do / but to be all of one accorde
and wyll. And alſo / by you and by youre
counſayle / the kyng hath ben here in the feldes
longe at great coſt and charge / for hym & for all
his / and layne at ſiege before Lixbone / & coude
neuer haue the aduenture of batayle tyll nowe
with hym that writeth hym ſelfe kyng of Portyngale / 
wherin he hath no right / for he is a baſtarde
and nat dyſpenſed with all: and now he
is in the felde with ſuche frēdes as he hath / whiche
is no great nombre. And if nowe by crafte
he ſhulde agayne withdrawe hym ſelfe and nat
fought with all / ye put your ſelfe than in aduē
               ture / 
that all the hole hooſt ſhulde ryſe on you &
ſlee you / or els that the kyng ſhulde repute you
for traytours / and ſtrike of your heedes and cō
               fyſke
all your landes. Therfore I ſe no better
way for you than to be ſtyll / and let them alone
that hath ſene more than you in ſuche buſyneſſes / 
for ye neuer ſawe that they haue done nor
neuer ſhall. And than ye kynge loked vp and by
ſemynge was gladde with thoſe wordes / & the
ſpanyardꝭ were abaſſhed / and feared they had
done gretter treſpace than they dyd / for though
the marſhall reproued them and ſpake agaynſt
them / yet they had well ſpoken and truely coū
               ſayled
the kyng / but what for valyantneſſe & to
pleaſe the ſtrangers / who deſyred batayle / the
marſhall ſpake as he dyde.
            Than euery man was ſtyll / and the kynge
ſayd. I wyll in the name of god and ſaynt Iames / 
that our enemyes be fought with all: and
all ſuche as wyll be made knyghtes to cōe forth
before me / for I wyll gyue thē thordre of knight
hode / in the honour of god and ſaynt George.
Than ther came forthe many ſquyers of Frāce
and of Byerne / & there they were made knightes
of the kyngꝭ hande: as ſir Roger of ſpayne / 
Edmōde ſon to ſir Roger of the coūtie of foiz / 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
               
               
Bertrand of Barroge / ſir Peter of Salebere / 
ſir Peter of Valentyne / ſir Wylliam of Quere
ſir Angers of Sollenayre / ſir Peter of Vande
ſir Wyllyam of Montigny / and of one & other / 
to the nōbre of a hundred and .xl. and ther were
certayne barons of Bierne that rayſed vp ther
firſt their baners / and alſo dyuers of Caſtell / &
alſo ſir Iohan of Rey. There might haue ben
ſene amonge theſe newe knightes great nobleneſſe / 
and they maynteyned them ſelfe ſo goodly / 
that it was pleaſure to beholde thē / for they
were a fayre batayle. Than the lorde of Loyngiache
came before the kyng / and all other that
were ſtrangers / what ſoeuer nacyon they were
of / ſo they were no ſpanyardꝭ / they were all named
in the name of ſtrangers. Than they ſaid
to the kynge. Sir / we become fro farre partes
to ſerue you. Sir / we requyre you do vs that
grace / to let vs haue the firſt batayle. I am content
quod the kyng / in the name of god and ſaīt
Iames / & ſaynt George be in your ayde. than
the ſpanyardes ſayd one to another ſoftely / beholde
for goddeſſake beholde / howe our kynge
putteth all his truſte in theſe frēchmen. He hath
no parfyte truſt in none other: they ſhall haue
the firſt batayle / they prayſe vs nat ſo moche yt
they wyll take vs with them / they wyll do their
dede by them ſelfe / and than lette vs do ours be
our ſelfe / let vs let them alone with their enterpriſe:
they haue made their auaunt / howe they
be ſtronge ynough to diſcomfyte the Portugaloys.
Lette it be ſo we are content / but it were
good we demaunded of the kynge / wheder he
wyll abyde with vs / or els go with the frenchemen.
So thervpon they were long in murmuryng / 
wheder they ſhulde demaūde it or els be
ſtyll / for they douted greatly the wordes of ſir
Raynolde Lymoſin / how be it all thynges conſydred
/ they thought it none yuell to demaunde
hym the queſtyon. Than ſixe of the mooſt notableſt
of them wente to the kynge / and enclyned
them ſelfe and ſayd.
            RIght noble kyng / we ſe & vnderſtand
well by aparent ſignes / that this day
ye ſhall haue batayle with youre enemyes / 
god ſende grace it be to your honoure &
vyctorie / as we greatly deſyre. Sir / we wolde
knowe wheder your pleaſure lyeth / to be amonge
the fenēchmen or els with vs. Fayre ſirs ꝙ
the kyng / though I haue graunted the firſt batayle
to theſe knightes and ſquyers ſtraūgers / 
who are come farre of to ſerue me / and are valyant
and expert men in warres / yet for all that
I renounce you nat / for I wyll be and abyde amonge
you: therfore ſirs / helpe to defende me.
Of this anſwere the ſpanyerdes had great ioy
and were well contented and ſayd. ſir / ſo ſhall
we do / and nat to fayle to dye in the quarell. for
ſir / we are ſworne to you and ſo haue promiſed
by the faithe of our bodyes whan ye were crowned.
For ſir / we loued ſo well the kyng your father / 
that we can nat ſayle you in any wiſe. that
is our truſt quod the kyng. So thus the kyng
of Spayne abode among his owne men / who
were well a twentie thouſande horſmen / all couered
in ſtele. Sir Raynolde Lymoſin was in
the firſt batayle / for it was his right ſo to be / by
cauſe he was marſhall.
            The ſame ſaturday was a fayre daye / & the
ſonne was tourned towarde euynſong. Than
the firſt batayle came before Iuberoth / where
the kyng of Portugale and his men were redy
to receyue thē. Of theſe frenche knightes there
were a two thouſāde ſpeares / as freſſhe and as
well ordred men as coulde be deuyſed. And as
ſoone as they ſawe their enemyes / they ioyned
toguyder lyke men of warre / and aproched in
good order tyll they came within a bowe ſhotte
And at their firſt comyng ther was a harde rē
               countre / 
for ſuche as deſyred to aſſayle to wyn
grace and prayſe / entred in to the ſtrayte way / 
where the Englyſſhmen by their policy had fortyfied
thē. And bycauſe thentre was ſo narowe
there was great preaſe and great miſchefe to ye
aſſaylātes / for ſuche englyſſhe archers as were
there ſhot ſo holly toguyder / that their arowes
pearſed men & horſe / and whan the horſes were
full of arowes they fell one vpon another. than
the Englyſſhmen of armes / the portugaloys / &
Lyxbonoyes / came on them cryeng their cryes
our lady of Portugale / with good ſpeares and
ſharpe heedes / wherwith they ſtrake and hurte
many knightes and ſquyers. There was the
lorde of Lanache of Bierne beaten downe / and
his baner won and he taken priſoner / and many
of his men taken and ſlayne. alſo ſir Iohan
of Ree / ſir Geffray Richon / ſir Geffray of parteney / 
and all their cōpanyes that were entred
within the ſtrayte / There horſes were ſo hurte
with tharchers / that they fell on their mayſters
and one vpon another. There theſe frenchmen
were in great danger / for they coulde nat helpe
one another / for they had no roume to enlarge
them ſelfe / nor to fight at their wyll. And whan
the portugaloys ſawe that myſchefe fall on the
firſt aſſaylers they were gladde / and as freſſhe

and coragyous to fyght as any men might be.
There was the kynge of Portugale with his
baners before hym / mounted on a good horſe / 
trapped with the armes of Portugale / and he
had great ioye to ſe yt myſchefe fall on his enemyes:
and to conforte his people he laughed &
ſayd a highe. On forthe good men / defēde you
and fight with good wyll / for if ther be no mo
but theſe we nede nat to feare / and if I knewe
euer any thynge in batayle / all theſe be ours.
Thus the kyng of Portugale reconforted his
people who fought valiātly / and had encloſed
in the ſtreight all the firſt aſſaylers / of whome
ther were many ſlayne. True it was that this
firſt batayle whiche theſe knightes of Fraūce
and of Bierne ledde / had thought to haue ben
quickelyer ayded of the ſpaynerdes than they
were / For if the kyng of Caſtyle and his company / 
who were a twentie thouſande men / had
come by another parte and aſſayled the portugaloys / 
it had been lykely the iourney to haue
ben theirs / but they dyde nothynge / wherfore
they were to blame and receyued domage. Alſo
in dede the frenchmen ſette on to ſoone / but
they dyde it to thentent to haue won honoure / 
and to maynteyne the wordes they had ſpoken
before the kyng: and alſo as I was enformed / 
the ſpaynierdes wolde nat ſette on ſo ſoone / for
they loued nat the frenchmen / for they had ſaid
before: Lette them alone / they ſhall finde right
well to whōe to ſpeke / theſe frēchmen ar great
vantours and highe mynded / & alſo our kyng
hath no ꝑfite truſt but in thē / and ſith the kyng
wolde they ſhulde haue the honour of the iourney / 
let vs ſuffre them to take it / or els we ſhall
haue all at our entētes. Thus by thſe meanes
the ſpanynierdes ſtode ſtyll in a great batayle / 
and wolde nat go forwarde / whiche was right
diſpleſant to the kyng / but he coude nat amēde
it / but the ſpaynierdes ſayd / bycauſe ther was
none retourned fro the batayle. ſir / ſurely theſe
knightes of Fraūce haue diſconfyted your enemyes / 
thonour of this iourney is theirs / God
gyue grace quod the kyng that it be ſo / Let vs
ryde than ſomwhat forwarde / that they rode
a croſbowe ſhotte forwarde and than agayne
reſted: It was a great beautie to ſe them / they
were ſo well moūted & armed / and in the mean
ſeaſon the frenchmen fought / and ſuche as had
leyſar to a light fought valiātly. dyuers knightes
and ſquyers of eyther partie dyd many feates
of armes one vpon another / & whan their
ſpeares fayled / they toke axes and gaue many
great ſtrokes on the helmes / ſleyng and maymynge
eche other.
            Who ſoeuer were in ſuche caſe of armes as
the frenchmen and portugaloys were at Iuberoth / 
muſt abyde the aduenture as they dyde / 
without they wolde flye awaye / and in flyeng
there is more paryll than to abyde the batayle / 
for in flyeng lightly are mooſt ſlayne / & in batayle
whan one ſeith he is ouermatched he yeldeth
hym ſelfe priſoner: It can nat be ſaid but
that the knightes of Fraunce / of Bretayne / of
Burgoyne / and of Byerne / but that right valiantly
fought / but at their firſt encountre they
were hardely handled / and all that was by the
counſayle of the Englyſſhmen to fortyfie their
place. So at this firſt batyle the portugaloys
were ſtrōger than their enemyes / ſo they were
all taken or ſlayne / but fewe that were ſaued / ſo
that there were at that firſte brunt a thouſande
knightes and ſquyers taken priſoners / wherof
the portugaloys were ioyfull / and thought
as that day to haue no more batayle / & ſo made
good chere to their priſoners / and euery man
ſayd to their priſoners. Sirs be nat abaſſhed
for ye are won by clene feate of armes / we ſhall
kepe you good company as we wolde ye ſhuld
do / if ye hadde vs in lyke caſe / ye ſhall come to
Lixbone and refreſſhe you there / and ſhalbe at
your eaſe / and they thanked theym whan they
ſawe none other bote. & ſo there ſome were put
to their fynaunce incōtynent / and ſome wolde
abyde their aduenture / for they ymagined that
the kynge of Spaygne with his great armye
wolde ſhortely come and delyuer them.

            ¶Howe the frenche knightes & gaſcoyns
ſuche as were taken priſoners
at Iuberoth by the portugaloys were
ſlayne of their mayſters & none eſcaped.
Cap. xxxv.
            
               TIdynges came in to the

and to his companye / who
were aprochynge to Iuberoth
by thē that fledde / who
cāe cryeng with great feare
and ſayd. ſir kyng auaunce
your ſelfe / for all they of ye vowarde are outher
taken or ſlayne / there is no remedy of their delyueraunce / 

without it be by your puyſſaunce / 
And whan the kyng of Caſtyle herde thoſe tidyngꝭ
he was ſore diſpleaſed / for he had good

               ded
to ryde on and ſayd auaūce for the baners / 
in the name of god and ſaynt George / lette vs
ryde to the reſcue / ſithe our men haue nede therof.
Than the ſpaynierdes began to ryde a better

that tyme the ſonne was nere downe / thā ſome
ſayd it were beſt to abyde tyll the mornyng / bycauſe
it was ſo nere night / they ſaid they coude

Than they rode forthe makyng great noyſe &

to abaſſhe therwith their enemyes. nowe ſhall
I ſhewe you what the kyng of Portugale dyd

            AS ſoone as they had diſcōfited the vowarde
and taken their priſoners / and
that they ſawe none other batayle comyng wt
               in
their ſight yet for all that they wolde put no

They that rode forthe came and ſawe the kynge
of Caſtelles great batayle comyng to them
warde / faſt approchynge to Iuberothe / more

retourned as faſt as they might / and ſayde all
an highe to the people. Sirs aduyſe you well
for as yet we haue done nothyng. beholde yonder
cometh the kyng of Caſtyle with his great
batayle / with mo than twentie thouſande men
there is none taryed behynde. Whā they herde
thoſe tidynges they toke ſhorte counſayle whiche

ordayned a pyteous dede. for euery man was
cōmaunded on payne of dethe to ſlee their priſoners
without mercy / noble / gentyll / ryche / 
nor other / none except. Than the lordes / knightes / 
and ſquyers that were priſoners were in a
harde caſe / for there was no prayer that auayled
them fro the dethe / and ſo they were ſlayne
ſome in one place and ſome in another as they

            ¶Howe the kynge of Caſtell and all
his great batayle were diſcōfyted by
the kyng of Portugale / before a vyllage
called Iuberoth. Cap. xxxvi.
            
               WHan the lixbonoiſe / englyſſhe / 
and Portugaloyſe / 
had delyuered the place and
ſlayne all their priſoners / neuer
a one ſcaped without he
were before conueyed to the
vyllage of Iuberoth / where
as all their caryages were. Than they drewe
all togyder with a feirſe wyll / on the ſame place
where as they were firſt aſſayled / & as than
the ſonne was goyng downe. Than the kyng
of Caſtell in a puyſſant array with his baners
and penons dyſplayed and mounted on their
horſes well couered / came on cryeng Caſtell / &
began to entre in to ye place that was fortified / 
and there they were receyued with ſperes and
axes / and at the firſt comyng the ſhotte of arowes
greued ſore their horſes / ſo that many therby
were ſlayne and ouerthrowen. And all that
ſeaſon the kyng of Caſtell nor his men. knewe
nat of the myſchiefe that was fallen to the vowarde / 
nat how they were all ſlayne / but he beleued
they had ben ſtyll priſoners / thynkynge
to recouer them agayne / as ye haue herde.
            
               
There was a harde batayle and a fyerſe / and
many a man caſte to the erthe / the portugalois
had no ſuche aduaūtage / but and they had nat
fought valiantly they had ben loſte and diſcō
               fyted:
that ſaued thē / was their enemyes coude
nat come on theym but by one narowe waye.
There the kyng of Portyngale lyghted a fote
and toke an axe in his hande and dyd marueylous
in armes / and beate downe a thre or four
with his owne handes / ſo that he was feared / 
that none durſt aproche nere him. I ſhall ſhew
ſome parte of the cōdycions of the ſpaniardes.
            TRewe it is / at their firſt ſettyng on they
are fierſe and coragyous / and of great
aduauntage / and hyghe mynded if they haue
auauntage: They fight well a horſ backe / but
as ſoone as they haue caſte two or thre dartes / 
and gyuen a ſtroke with their ſwerde / and ſe
that their enemyes be nat diſcōfyted therwith / 
than they feare and turne their horſes and flye
awaye to ſaue them ſelfe that beſt maye. And
at this bataile of Iuberoth they vſed the ſame
playe / for they foūde their enemyes harde and
ſtrong / and as freſſhe in the batayle as though
they had done nothynge of all the daye before / 
wherof they had marueyle / and alſo that they
harde no tidynges of the vowarde / nor where
they were become. There the ſpayniardꝭ that
euenyng were in the harde fortune of batayle
and perylous for them / for as many as entred
into their ſtrength / were by valyantneſſe and
feates of armes all ſlayne. They toke no man
to raūſom whatſoeuer he were noble or other.
ſo the Lixbonoys had ordayned / for they wolde
nat be charged with priſoners: The
                  •
                were
ſlayne of them of Caſtell ſuche as foloweth.
Sir Dangonnes Nendreche / ſir Digo Perſement / 
ſir don Peter of Roſermont / ſir Mare
of Verſaux / the great maiſter of Caleſtrane &
his brother / who was that daye made knight / 
called ſir Dygomor / ſir Peter Gouſſart of mō
               deſque / 
don Peter Gouſſart of Sonuyll / don
Iohan Radigo of Rouſell / and a threſcore baronnes
and knightes of Spaygne. At the batayle
of Naders / where the prince of Wales
diſconfyted kyng don Henry of Caſtell / there
were nat ſlayne ſo many noble men of Caſtell / 
as there was at this batayle of Iuberoth whiche
was the yere of grace / a thouſande thre hū
               dred
fourſcore and fyue / on a ſaturday on oure
lady day in Auguſt.
            Whan the kyng of Caſtell vnderſtode and
ſawe howe his menne were thus diſconfyted / 
and howe that his vowarde was clene diſconfyted
without recouery / and that ſir Raynalt
Lymoſin was deed / who was his marſhall / &
ſawe howe all his noble chiualty were loſt / as
well of his owne realme as of Fraunce / & elles
where / ſuche as were come thider to ſerue him
with their good wylles: He was than ſore diſpleaſed
and wyſte nat what counſayle to take / 
for he ſawe his mē began to flye on euery ſyde / 
and he herde howe ſome ſayd to hym / ſir deꝑte
hens it is tyme / the mater is in a herde caſe. ye
can nat alone diſconfyte your enemyes / nor recouer
your domages: your people flyeth all about / 
euery man intendeth to ſaue hym ſelfe.
Sir / ſaue youre ſelfe and ye do wyſely / if fortune
be this day agaynſt you / another tyme it
ſhall be better. The kynge of Caſtyle beleued
coūſayle & than chaunged his horſe & mounted
on a freſſhe courſer / ſtrong and light / wheron
no man had rydden before of all daye. Than
the kyng ſtrake the horſe with his ſpurres / and
tourned his backe towarde his enemyes / and
toke the waye towarde ſaynt yrayne / whyder
all ſuche as wolde ſaue themſelfe fledde. The
ſame tyme the kyng of Caſtell hadde a knight
of his houſe who bare his baſſenet / whervpon
there was a ſercle of golde and ſtones / valued
to twentie thouſande frankes. It was ordayned
or they went out of ſaynt yrayne / that this
knight ſhulde beare it tyll they came to the buſyneſſe / 
and than to delyuer it to the kynge to
weare on his heed / but this knight dyd nat ſo / 
For whan they came to the ioyninge of the batayle
the preaſe was ſo great / that this knyght
coude nat cōe to the kynge / nor alſo he was nat
called for / wherfore he aproched nat to ye kyng.
And whan he ſawe howe his cōpany were diſcomfyted / 
and that the portugaloys optayned
the vyctorie / and ſawe howe euery man fledde
on euery ſyde / he feared than the leſyng of ſuch
a riche iowell / and ſet than the baſſenet on his
owne heed and ſo fledde / but he toke nat ye way
to ſaynt yrayne / but toke another waye to the
towne of Arpent. Thus ſome fledde this way
and ſome that waye / lyke people ſore diſconfyted
and abaſſhed / but the mooſt parte fledde to
ſaynt yrayne: and that euenynge thyder came
the kyng ſore abaſſhed.
            AT this diſconfyture of the ſpaynierdes
at Iuberothe / where the Portugaloys
and lixbonoys optayned the place / the
                  •
                was a
great ſlaughter of men / and it had ben gretter
if they had folowed in the chaſe / but thengliſſh

men whan they ſawe the ſpaygniardes tourne
their backes / they ſayd to the kyng of Portugale
and to his men. Sirs / demaunde for yo
                  •
               
horſes and folowe the chaſe / and all they that
be fledde ſhalbe outher taken or ſlayne. Naye
nat ſo quod the kynge / it ſuffyceth that we haue
done / oure men be wery and ſore traueyled
and it is nere hande night / we ſhall nat knowe
whyder to go. And thoughe they flye yet they
be a great nombre / and paraduenture they do
it to drawe vs out of our ſtrength / and ſo to haue
vs at their eaſe: Let vs this daye kepe them
that be deed / and to morowe take other counſayle.
By my faythe ſir quod Harteſell an Englyſſhman / 
the deed bodyes are eaſy to be kept
they ſhall neuer do vs any hurte / nor we ſhall
haue of them no profyte. We haue ſlayne many
good priſoners / and we be ſtraungers and
are come farre of to ſerue you / therfore we wolde
fayne wynne ſomwhat of theſe calues that
flye without wynges / with their banners wauyng
with the wynde. Fayre brother quod the
kyng / they that all coueteth all leſeth: It is better
we be ſure / ſythe the honour of the vyctorie
is ours / & that god hath ſende it vs rather than
to putte our ſelfe in paryll / whan it nedeth nat:
We thāke god we haue ynowe to make you all
ryche. Thus in this caſe the buſyneſſe reſted.
            THus as I haue ſhewed you / felle of the
buſyneſſe at Iuberothe / where as the
kynge of Portugale optayned the vyctorie: &
the
                  •
                were ſlayne a fyue hundred knightes and
as many ſquyers / whiche was great pytie and
domage / and about a ſixe or ſeuyn thouſande
of other men / god haue mercy on their ſoules.
And all that night tyll on the ſōday to the hour
of prime / the kyng of Portugale and his men
remoued nat fro the place that they were in nor
neuer vnarmed thē / but eate a lytell and drāke
euery man as they ſtode / whiche was brought
them fro the vyllage of Iuberothe. And on the
ſonday in the mornyng after the ſonne ryſinge
the kynge cauſed twelfe knightes to mount on
their horſes / and to ryde forthe to ſertche the felde
                  •
               
to ſe if there were any newe aſſemble and
whan they had 
                  •
               ydden here and there / they retourned
and ſhewed how they founde no body
but deed men. Well quod the kyng of them we
nede nat to doute. Than it was publyſſhed to
departe thens and to go to the vyllage of Iube
rothe thereto abyde all that day and night tyll
monday in the mornynge. So thus they departed
and lefte the churche of Iuberothe / and
went to the vyllage and there lodged / and taryed
out all that ſondaye and the nexte nyght:
And on the monday in the mornyng they coū
               ſayled
to drawe towarde Lixbone / Than they
ſowned trumpettes to diſlodge / and ſo in gode
order they deꝑted and rode towarde Lixbone / 
and the tueſday the kynge entred into ye towne
with moche people / glorie / and tryumphe / and
was receyued with proceſſyon and ſo brought
to his palays: And in ryding through the ſtretes
the people and chyldren made feeſt and reuerence / 
and cryed with highe voice. Lyue the
noble kyng of Portugale / to whome god hath
gyuen that grace to haue vyctorie of the puyſſaunt
kynge of Caſtyle / and hath diſconfyted
his enemyes.
            bI this iourney that the kyng of Portugale
had of the kyng of Caſtyle / he
felle in to ſuche grace and loue of his
countrey and realme of Portugale / ſo that all
ſuche as before the batayle dyd diſſimule with
hym / than came all to hym to Lixbone to do to
hym their homage: ſayeng / howe he was well
worthy to lyue / and howe that god loued hym / 
in that he had diſconfyted a more puiſſaūt kynge
than he was himſelfe / wherfore he was worthy
to beare a crowne. Thus the kynge gatte
the grace of his people / and ſpecially of all the
commons of the realme. ¶Nowe let vs a lytell
ſpeke of the kyng of Caſtyle / who after he
was thus diſconfyted / went to ſaynt yrayn we
pynge and lamentyng for his people / and curſyng
his harde fortune / that ſo many noble mē
of his owne countre & of Fraunce were ſlayne
in the felde.
            
               THe ſame tyme that he entred in to
ſaynt yrayne / yet he knewe nat the
domage that he had / but on the ſō
               daye
he knewe it / for he had ſende
his haraldꝭ to ſertche out the deed
bodyes. And he thought before / that the mooſt
parte of all ſuche as the harauldes foūde deed / 
had bene but priſoners & ſaued a lyue / but they
were nat as it appered. than he was ſo ſore diſpleaſed
and ſorie / that no man coulde comforte
hym. Whan he herde the reporte of the harauldes / 
and knewe the certentie of them that were
deed / Than he ſayd and ſware / that he ſhulde
neuer haue ioye ſythe ſo many noble men were
deed in his quarell. And after the thirde daye
that the kyng had taryed at ſaynt yrayne / there
came to him his knight with his baſſenet / who

was called ſir Martyn Haren / and delyuered
the baſſenet to the kynge / whiche was valued
as ye haue herde before: And before there had
ben herde wordes ſpoken of hym. Some ſaid
that falſely he was ronne awaye fro the kynge
and wolde neuer retourne agayne. Than the
knight kneled downe before the kyng and excuſed
hym ſelfe ſo largely / that the kynge & his
counſayle were well content with hym. Than
a fyftene dayes after the kynge of Caſtyle retourned
to Bergus in Spayne / and gaue euerye
man leaue to deꝑte. Than after the
                  •
                was
meanes and treaties made bytwene the kynge
of Caſtyle and the kyng of Portugale: Than
a truce was taken fro the feeſt of ſaynt Mychaell
to the firſt day of May / bothe by lande and
by See. And the deed bodyes ſlayne at Iuberothe / 
were buryed in the churche of Iuberoth
and in mother churches there aboute: and the
bones of dyuers caryed by their ſeruaūtes in
to their owne countreis.

            ¶Howe a ſpyrite called Orthone ſerued
the lorde of Coraſſe a long tyme
and brought hym euer tidynges frō
all partes of the worlde. Cap. xxxvii.
            
               IT is great marueyle
to conſyder one thynge / the
whiche was ſhewed me in
therle of Foiz houſe at Ortayſe / 
of hym that enfourmed
me of the buſyneſſe at
Iuberothe / He ſhewed me
one thyng that I haue oftentymes thought on
ſithe / and ſhall do as longe as I lyue. As this
ſquyer tolde me / that of trouthe the nexte daye
after the bataile was thus fought at Iuberoth
the erle of Foiz knewe it / wherof I had great
marueyle: For the ſayd ſonday / monday / and
tueſday / therle was very penſyfe / and ſo ſadde
of chere / that no man coulde here a worde of
hym. And all the ſame thre dayes he wolde nat
iſſue out of his chambre / nor ſpeke to any man
thoughe they were neuer ſo nere about hym.
And on the Tueſday at night he called to hym
his brother Arnault Guyllyam / and ſayde to
hym with a ſofte voyce. Our men hath had to
do wherof I am ſorie / for it is come of them by
their voyage / as I ſayd or they departed. Arnault
Guyllyam who was a ſage knyght / and
knewe right well his brothers cōdicions / ſtode
ſtyll and gaue none anſwere. And than therle
who thought to declare his mynde more plainlye
(for long he had borne the trouble therof in
his herte) ſpake agayne more hygher than̄e he
dyd before / and ſayd. By god ſir Arnault it is
as I ſaye / and ſhortely ye ſhall here tidynges
therof / but the countrey of Bierne this hūdred
yere / neuer loſte ſuche a loſſe at no iourney / as
they haue done nowe in Portugale. Dyuers
knyghtes and ſquyers that were there preſent
and herde hym ſay ſo / ſtode ſtyll and durſt nat
ſpeke but remembred his wordes. And within
a ten dayes after they knewe the trouthe therof
by ſuche as had ben at the buſyneſſe / and there
they ſhewed euery thyng as it was fortuned at
Iuberothe. Than therle renewed agayne his
dolour and all the countrey were in ſorowe / for
they had loſte their parentes / bretherne / chyldren / 
and frendes. Saynt Mary quod I to
the ſquyer that ſhewed me this tale. Howe is
it that therle of Foiz coude knowe on one day / 
what was done within a day or two before / beynge
ſo farre of? By my faythe ſir quod he as
it appered well / he knewe it. Than he is a deuyner
quod I / or els he hathe meſſangers that
flyeth with the wynde / or he muſte nedes haue
ſome crafte: The ſquyer began to laughe and
ſayd. Surely he muſte knowe it by ſome arte
of Nigromanſye / or otherwyſe. To ſaye the
trouthe we can nat tell howe it is / but by oure
ymaginacions. Sir quod I / ſuche ymaginacion
as ye haue therin / if it pleaſe you to ſhewe
me I wolde be gladde therof: & if it be ſuch a
thynge as ought to be ſecrete / I ſhall nat publyſſhe
it / nor as long as I am in this countre
I ſhall neuer ſpeke worde thereof. I praye you
therof ꝙ the ſquyer / for I wolde nat it ſhulde
be knowen that I ſhulde ſpeke therof / But I
ſhall ſhewe you as dyuers men ſpeketh ſecretelye / 
whan they be togyder as frendes. Than
he drewe me a parte into a corner of the chapell
at Ortayſe / and than began his tale and ſayd.
            IT is well a twentie yeres paſte / that
there was in this countrey a barone / 
called Raymon lorde of Coraſſe / whiche
is a ſeuyn leages fro this towne of Ortaiſe
This lorde of Coraſſe had yt ſame tyme a plee
at Auygnon before the pope / for the dyſmes of
his churche / agaynſt a clerke curate there: the
whiche preeſt was of Cateloygne. He was a

great cleke / and claymed to haue ryght of the
dyſmes in the towne of Coraſſe / whiche was
valued to a hūdred florens by the yere / and the
right that he had he ſhewed and proued it. And
by ſentence diffynityue / pope Vrbane the fyfte
in conſiſtory generall / condempned the knight
and gaue iugement with the preeſt. and of this
laſt iugement he had letters of the pope for his
poſſeſſion / & ſo rode tyll he came in to Bierne / 
and there ſhewed his letters & bulles of the popes
for his poſſeſſion of his diſmes. The lorde
of Coraſe had great indignacion at this preeſt
and cāe to hym & ſaid. mayſter Pe
                  •
                or maiſter
Marten / as his name was: Thynkeſt yu that
by reaſon of thy letters / that I wyll leſe myne
herytage? Nat ſo hardy yt thou take any thynge
that is myne / if thou do it ſhall coſte the thy
lyfe / Go thy waye in to ſome other place to get
the a benefyce / for of myne herytage thou getteſt
no parte / and ones for alwayes I defende
the. The clerke douted the knight for he was a
cruell man / therfore he durſte nat parceyuer.
Than he thought to retourne to Auygnon as
he dyde / but whan he departed he came to the
knight the lorde of Coraſſe and ſayd. Sir / by
force and nat by right / ye take away fro me the
right of my churche / wherin ye greatly hurte
your cōſcience. I am nat ſo ſtrong in this coū
               trey
as ye be. But ſir / knowe for trouthe / that
as ſoone as I maye / I ſhall ſende to you ſuche
a champyon / whome ye ſhall doute more than
me. the knight who douted nothyng his thretnynges
ſayd: God be with the / do what thou
mayſt / I doute no more dethe than lyfe / for all
thy wordes / I wyll nat leſe myne herytage.
Thus the clerke departed fro the lorde of Coraſſe / 
and went I can nat tell wheder / to Auygnon
or into Cateloygne / and forgate nat the
promyſe that he had made to the lorde of Coraſſe
or he departed. For afterwarde whan the
knyght thought leeſt on hym / about a thre monethes
after / as the knyght laye on a nyght a
bedde in his caſtell of Coraſſe with the ladye
his wyfe / there came to hym meſſangers in viſyble / 
and made a marueylous tempeſt & noiſe
in the caſtell / that it ſemed / as thoughe the caſtell
ſhulde haue fallen downe / and ſtrake gret
ſtrokes at his chambre dore / that the good ladye
his wyfe was ſoore afrayde. The knyght
herde all but he ſpake no worde therof / bycauſe
he wolde ſhewe no abaſſhed corage / for he was
hardy to abyde all aduentures. This noyſe &
tempeſt was in ſondrie places of 
                  •
                caſtell / and
dured a longe ſpace / and at laſte ceſſed for that
nyght. Than the nexte mornynge / all the ſeryaūtes
of the houſe came to the lorde whan he
was ryſen and ſayd. Sir / haue you nat herde
this night that we haue done? The lorde dyſſymuled
and ſayd no / I herde nothyng. What
haue you herde. Than they ſhewed him what
noyſe they hadd herde / and howe all the veſſell
in the kechyn was ouertourned. Than the lorde
began to laughe and ſayde. yea ſirs / ye dremed / 
it was nothynge but the wynde. In the
name of god quod the ladye / I herde it well.
The nexte night there was as great noyſe and
greatter / and ſuche ſtrokes gyuen at his chambre
dore and wyndowes / as all ſhulde haue broken
in peces. The knyght ſtarte vp out of his
bedde / and wolde nat lette to demaunde who
was at his chambre dore that tyme of ye night:
and anone he was aunſwered by a voyce that
ſayde / I am here. Quod the knyght / who ſent
the hyder? The clerke of Catelloygne ſent me
hyder quod the voyce / to whom thou doſt gret
wronge / for thou haſt taken fro hym the ryghtes
of his benefyce / I wyll nat leaue the in reſt
tyll thou haſte made hym a good accompte / ſo
that he be pleaſed. Quod the knyght / what is
thy name / that arte ſo good a meſſangere? ꝙ
be I ame called Orthone. Orthone quod the
knyght / the ſeruyce of a clerke is lytell profyte
for the / He wyll putte the to / to moche payne if
thou beleue hym. I pray the leaue hym & come
and ſerue me / & I ſhall gyue the good thanke.
Orthone was redy to aunſwere / for he was in
amouts with the knyght and ſayde. Woldeſt
thou fayne haue my ſeruyce? yea truely quod
the knyght / ſo thou do not hurte to any perſone
in this houſe. No more I wyll do quod Orthon
for I haue no power to do any other yuel
but to awake the out of thy ſlepe or ſome other
Well quod the knyght do as I tell the / and we
ſhall ſoone agree / and leaue the yuell clerke for
there is no good thyng in him / but to put the to
payne / therfore cōe and ſerue me. well ꝙ orthon
and ſythe thou wylte haue me we are agreed.
            SO this ſpyrite Orthone loued ſo the
knight / that often tymes he wolde cōe
and vyſite hym / whyle he laye in his
bedde a ſlepe / and outher pull hym by the care
or els ſtryke at his chambre dore or wyndowe / 
to awake hym. And whan the knyght awoke
than he wolde ſaye. Orthon let me ſlepe. Nay
quod Orthone that wyll I nat do / tyll I haue
ſhewed the ſuche tidynges as are fallen a late.
The lady the knyghtes wyfe wolde be ſore afrayed

that her heer wolde ſtande vp / and hyde
her ſelfe vnder the clothes. Than̄e the knight
wolde ſaye. Why / what tidynges haſte thou
brought me? Quod Orthone / I am come out
of Englande or out of Hungry / or ſome other
place / and yeſterdaye I came thens / and ſuche
thynges are fallen or ſuche other. So thus the
lorde of Coraſſe knewe by Orthon euery thynge
that was done in any parte of the worlde.
And in this caſe he contynued a fyue yere and
coude nat kepe his owne counſayle / but at laſte
diſcouered it to the erle of Foiz / I ſhall ſhewe
you howe.
            
               THe firſte yere the lorde of Coraſſe
came on a daye to Orthayſe to the
erle of Foiz / and ſayd to hym. ſir
ſuche thynges are done in Englā
               de / 
or in Scotlande / or in Almaygne / 
or in any other countrey. and euer the erle
of Foiz founde his ſayeng true / and had great
marueyle howe he ſhulde knowe ſuche thyngꝭ
ſo ſhortly. And on a tyme therle of Foiz examyned
hym ſo ſtraitly / that the lorde of Coraſe ſhewed
hym all toguyder howe he knewe it / and
howe he came to hym firſte. Whan the Erle of
Foiz herde that he was ioyfull and ſayd. Sir / 
of Coraſſe / kepe hym well in your loue / I wolde
I hadd ſuche a meſſangere: He coſteth you
nothynge / and ye knowe by hym euery thynge
that is done in the worlde: The knight anſwered
and ſayd. ſir / that is true. Thus the lorde
of Coraſſe was ſerued with Orthon a long ſeaſon / 
I can nat ſaye if this Orthone hadde any
mo mayſters or nat. But euery weke twyſe or
thriſe he wolde come and vyſite the lorde of Coraſſe / 
and wolde ſhewe hym ſuche tidynges of
any thyng that was fallen fro whens he came.
And euer the lorde of Coraſſe whan he knewe
any thynge / he wrote therof euer to the Erle of
Foiz / who had great ioy therof / for he was the
lorde of the worlde that mooſt deſyred to here
newes out of ſtraunge places. And on a tyme
the lorde of Coraſſe was with the erle of Foiz / 
and the erle demaunded of hym and ſaid. Sir
of Coraſſe / dyd ye euer as yet ſe your meſſangere?
Naye ſurely ſir quod the knyght / nor I
neuer deſyred it. That is marueyle quod the
Erle / if I were as well acquaynted with hym
as ye be / I wolde haue deſyred to haue ſene hi / 
wherfore I praye you deſyre it of hym / & than
to tell me whet forme and facyon he is of: I haue
herde you ſay howe he ſpeketh as good gaſcone
as outher you or I. Truely ſir quod the
knight ſo it is / he ſpeketh as well and as fayre
as any of vs bothe do. And ſurely ſir / ſithe ye
counſayle me I ſhall do my payne to ſe hym &
I can. And ſo on a night as he lay in his bedde
with the lady his wyfe / who was ſo enured to
here Orthon / that ſhe was no more afrayde of
hym. Than came Orthon and pulled the lord
by the eare / who was faſt a ſlepe / and therwith
he awoke and aſked who was the
                  •
               . I am here
quod Orthon. Than he demaūded / fro whens
comeſt yu nowe? I come ꝙ Orthon fro Prage
in Boeſme. Howe farre is that hens quod the
knyght? A threſcore dayes iourney quod Orthone.
and arte thou come thens ſo ſoone quod
the knight? ye truely quod Orthon / I came as
faſt as the wynde or faſter. haſt thou than wynges
quod the knight? Nay truely ꝙ he. Howe
canſte thou than flye ſo faſte quod the knyght?
ye haue nothyng to do to knowe that quod Orthone.
No quod the knight / I wolde gladly ſe
the / to knowe what forme thou arte of. Well ꝙ
Orthon / ye haue nothing to do to knowe / it ſufficeth
you to here me / & I to ſhewe you tidyngꝭ
In faythe ꝙ the knyght / I wolde loue the moche
better and I myght ſe the ones. Well ꝙ Orthone.
ſir ſithe ye haue ſo great deſyre to ſeme / 
the firſte thynge that ye ſe to morowe whan yt
ryſe out of your bedde / the ſame ſhalbe I. that
is ſufficient quod the lorde. Go thy way I gyue
the leaue to departe for this nyght. And the
next mornynge the lorde roſe / and the lady his
wyfe was ſo afrayd that ſhe durſt nat ryſe / but
fayned her ſelfe ſicke / & ſayd ſhe wolde nat ryſe
Her huſbande wolde haue had her to haue ryſen.
ſir quod ſhe than I ſhall ſe Orthone / & I
wolde nat ſe him by my good wyll. Well ꝙ the
knight I wolde gladly ſe hym. and ſo he aroſe
fayre and eaſely out of his bedde / & ſat downe
on his bedde ſyde / wenyng to haue ſene orthon
in his owne ꝓperforme / but he ſawe nothyng
wherby he might ſaye / Loyonder is Orthon / 
So that daye paſſed and the nexte night came
and whan the knyght was in his bedde orthon
came and began to ſpeke / as he was accuſtomed.
Go thy waye quod the knight / thou arte
but alyer: Thou promyſeſt that I ſhulde haue
ſene the / and it was nat ſo. No quod he / & I ſhewed
my ſelfe to the. that is nat ſo ꝙ the lorde.
why ꝙ Orthon / whā ye roſe out of your bedde
ſawe you nothynge? Than the lorde ſtudyed
a lytell and aduyſed hymſelfe well. yes truely
quod the knyght nowe I remembre me / as I

ſatte on my beddes ſyde / thynkynge on the / I
ſawe two ſtrawes on the pauement tumblyng
one vpon another. That ſame was I ꝙ Orthone / 
in to that fourme I dyde put my ſelfe as
than / That is nat ynoughe to me quod the lorde.
I praye the putte thy ſelfe in to ſome other
fourme / that I maye better ſe and knowe the.
Well ꝙ Orthon / ye wyll do ſo moche yt ye wyll
leſe me and I go fro you / for ye deſyre to moch
of me. Naye quod the knyght thou ſhalte nat
go fro me / let me ſe the ones and I wyll deſyre
no more. Well quod Orthone ye ſhall ſe me to
morowe / take hede / the firſte thynge that ye ſe
after ye be out of your chābre it ſhalbe I. Well
quod the knight I am than cōtent / go thy way
lette me ſlepe. And ſo Orthone departed / and
the nexte mornynge the lorde a roſe and yſſued
out of his chambre and went to a wyndowe / &
loked downe in to the courte of the caſtell / and
caſte about his eyen. And the firſte thynge he
ſawe was a Sowe / the greatteſt that euer he
ſawe / and ſhe ſemed to be ſo leane and yuell fauoured / 
that there was nothyng on her but the
ſkynne & the bones / with long eares and a longe
leane ſnout. The lorde of Coraſſe had marueyle
of that leane Sowe / and was wery of ye
ſight of her / and cōmaunded his men to fetche
his houndes / and ſayd. Lette the dogges hunt
her to dethe / and deuoure her. His ſeruauntes
opyned the kenelles and lette out his houndes / 
and dyde ſette them on this ſowe. And at the
laſte the ſowe made a great crye / and loked vp
to the lorde of Coraſſe as he loked out at a wyndowe / 
and ſo ſodaynely vanyſſhed awaye no
man wyſte howe. Than the lorde of Coraſſe
entred in to his chambre right penſyue: & than
he remembred hym of Orthon his meſſangere
and ſayd. I repent me that I ſette my hoūdes
on hym: It is an aduenture and euer I here any
more of hym / for he ſayd to me often tymes
that if I diſpleaſed hym I ſhulde leſe hym. the
lorde ſaid trouthe / for neuer after he came in to
the caſtell of Coraſſe / and alſo the knight dyed
the ſame yere next folowynge. Lo ſir quod the
ſquyer / thus I haue ſhewed you the lyfe of Orthone / 
and howe a ſeaſon he ſerued the lorde of
Coraſſe with newe tidynges. It is true ſir ꝙ
I / but nowe as to your firſte purpoſe / Is the
erle of Foiz ſerued with ſuche a meſſangere?
Surely quod the ſquier it is the ymaginacion
of many that he hath ſuche meſſāgers / for the
                  •
               
is nothynge done in any place / but and he ſette
his mynde therto he wyll knowe it / and whan
men thynke leeſt therof. And ſo dyde he whan
the good knightes and ſquyers of this countrey
were ſlayne in Portugale at Iuberothe.
Some ſaythe the knowledge of ſuche thynges
hath done hym moche profyte / for and there be
but the value of a Spone loſte in his houſe / a
none he wyll knowe whe
                  •
                it is. So thus than
I toke leaue of the ſquyer and went to other cō
               pany / 
but I bare well awaye his tale.
            ¶Nowe I wyll leaue to ſpeke of the buſynes
of Portugale and of Spaygne / and ſpeke of
the buſyneſſe in Languedocke and in Fraūce.

            ¶Howe a ſiege was layde to Breſte
in Bretaygne / and howe dyuers englyſſhe
fortreſſes about the countre
of Tholous were recouered and turned
frenche. Cap. xxxviii.
            
               IN the ſeaſon whyle
theſe aduentures thus felle
in Caſtyle and in far
                  •
                marcheſſe / 
it was ordayned by
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon conſtable
of Fraunce / to make
a baſtyde before the ſtrong
caſtell of Breſt in Bretaygne / whiche the Englyſſhmen
helde and had done longe / & wolde
nat departe / nother for the frenche kyng nor for
the duke of Bretayne / to whom the caſtell ſhulde
partayne. The duke of Berrey and the duke
of Burgoyne / and the frenche kynges counſayle / 
hadde oftentymes written to the duke of
Bretayne / deſyring hym to putte to his payne
and dilygence to gette agayne his enheritaūce
the caſtell of Breſt / for it was gretly to his preiudyce
to ſuffre the Englyſſhmen to enioye it.
And the duke / what for the prayer of the ſayde
lordes / and alſo bycauſe he wolde gladly haue
had the poſſeſſion of Breſt in his owne hādes.
On a tyme he layd ſiege therto but nothyng he
wan there / and ſo departed thens & ſayd / howe
he coude do nothyng the
                  •
                / wherat ſome knightes
& ſquyers murmured and ſayde / howe the
duke dyd but diſſimule / for ſuche as were the
                  •
               
he tooke theym nat for his frendes / nor wolde
nat / for all the Peace that was made / that the

caſtell of Breſt ſhulde be in the frenche kynges
handes / for if the frenchmen helde it / he ſhulde
nat be lorde therof / yet he had rather it were in
the Englyſſhe mens handes / for the Englyſſhe
men durſt nat diſpleaſe him. wherfore all thynges
cōſydred / the conſtable of Fraūce thought
that the caſtell of Breeſt and the towne / were
nat mete to be enemy to the realme of Fraunce / 
And thought it nat honorable for the duke nor
for the knyghtes of Bretaygne / to ſuffre it as
they dyde. Therfore he ordayned to laye ſiege
therto / with a great nombre of knyghtes and
ſquyers of Bretaygne: and he made chiefe capitaynes
of them / the lorde of Moleſtroyt / the
vycount of Barleere / Morfane / and the lorde
of Roche Duraunt: Theſe foure valyant men
wente and layde ſiege as nere to Breſt as they
might / and made a baſtyde and cloſed it about
with pales and ſtones / and tooke fro Breſt all
their iſſues / excepte the See / whiche was nat
in their power to cloſe fro them. And often tymes
there were ſcrimyſſhes and feates of armes
done before ye barryers / for ſuche as were
without / deſyringe dedes of armes / wolde cōe
valyantly to the barryers / and they within receyued
theym as valyantly / ſo that often there
were dyuers hurt on bothe ꝑties. There were
but fewe dayes but that ſome dedes of armes
were done.
            THe ſame ſeaſon there was in the marcheſſe
of Tholouſyn a valyant knyght
of Fraūce / called ſir Galtier Paſchac / a good
capitayne of men of warre / he was of the nacyon
of Berrey / on the fronters of Lymoſyn / 
and or his comynge / the ſeneſchall of Tholous
ſir Roger of Spaygne / and ſir Hugh of Frodeuyll / 
and the ſeneſchall of Carcaſſone / hadde
written in to Fraunce to the Conſtable there / 
of the ſtate of the countre of Tholous and Robeſtan / 
and howe that dyuers of the companyons
aduenturers / ſuche as were yſſued out of
Lourde and of caſtell Cuyllet / and had made
warre for the Englyſſhmen / helde in their handes
the fortreſſes folowyng. As ſaynt Forget /

cytie of Tholous / that the people coude nat yſſue
oute to labour their vynes and landes / nor
go on marchandyſe / but in great paryll / without
they had truce / or pateſed with them. And
of all theſe caſtels / the chiefe capitayne was an
expert man of warre of Baſque / called Eſpaigoullet / 
he dyd many marueylous dedes in armes.
He toke on a tyme by ſcalynge the caſtell
of Armayle / whyle the lorde therof / ſir Raymonde
was gone to Tholous / and he kepte it
more than a yere. & in the meane ſeaſon whyle
he kepte it / he cauſed to be made a myne and a
caue / whiche went out of the caſtell in to the feldes:
And whan the caue was made / he cloſed
vp the entre with ſtones / ſo that it coulde nat
be parceyued that any waye was there vnder
the yerthe. And in the ſame meane ſeaſon the
lorde Raymonde of Armayle treated with Eſpayguollet / 
to haue agayne his caſtell for money.
Whan the caue was finyſſhed / he agreed
with the lorde to delyuer vp the caſtell for two
thouſande frankes / and he and all his to deꝑte
Than the lorde entred agayne in to his caſtell
and repayred it where it was in defaulte. And
a fyftene dayes after Eſpaiguollet with his cō
               pany
in a night came to the wode where the yſſue
of the caue was / and entred in to it. And ſo
at the hour of mydnight they toke the caſtell / &
the lorde lyenge in his bedde / and raunſomed
hym agayne at two thouſande frankes / & than
let hym go / but Eſpayguollet kept ſtyll the caſtell
and a good gariſon / whiche after ſore traueyled
the countrey with other of his alyaunce
and company.
            FOr theſe maner of people that robbed
& pylled thus in the marches of Tholous / 
of Rouergue / and there about / 
vnder the colour of the Englyſſhmen / Therfore
thyder was ſente ſir Gaultier of Paſchac
with a certayne nombre of men of armes / to delyuer
the countre fro their enemyes. And ſo he
came to Tholous / & ſent for the knyghtes and
ſquyers therabout / and wrote to ſir Roger of
Spaygne ſeneſchall of Carcaſſone who came
to ſerue hym / for ſir Gaultier had a cōmiſſyon
generall ouer all the offycers of Languedocke
and ſo all ſuche as were ſent for / came with ſuche
nombres as they might make. Sir Roger
of Spayne came with a threſcore ſpeares and
a hundred paueſſes / and the ſeneſchall of Rouergue
and ſir Hugh Frodeuyll came with as
many or mo. So whan they were all togyder / 
they were a four .C. ſpeares & a .M. paueſſes.
And alſo there was the ſonne of therle of Tereache
with a fayre cōpany / the lorde of barbaſon
ſir Benedic of Faguell / & Willm̄ Caudron breto
                  •
               
& their cōpanyes: ſo one day they departed

fro Tholous and came before ſaynt Forgette / 
and there reſted: & there was capitayne a man
of Bierne a great robber / called the bourge of
Taylſacke. Whan theſe lordes and their companyes
were come before Forget / they incontynent
went to the aſſaut / and the genowayes began
ſore to ſhote / ſo yt ſcant they within durſte
apere at their defence / but the frenchmen myſt
of their purpoſe at this firſt aſſaute▪ & ſo there
they lodged all night & toke their eaſe / for they
had ynoughe wherwith. In the mornyng betymes
they armed them throughe the hoſt / and
ſowned their trumpettes to the aſſaute / and ſo
they came in good ordre to the fote of the dyke / 
he that had ſene than (the men of armes entre
in to the dykes with their targettes ouer their
heedes / and taſted the dyke with their ſpeares
and paſſed ouer to the fote of the wall) wolde
haue taken great pleaſur. Whan the firſt were
paſſed ouer the dyke / and had ſhewed the way
to other: than other folowed with great wyll / 
for it had ben great blame to them / if they had
than taryed behynde / and their cōpany before.
and ſuche as folowed them had matockes and
pykes in their hādes to pearſe withall the walles / 
and couered their heedes with targettes to
receyue the ſtones that were caſte downe / whiche
were no great plentie / for the genowayes
ſhotte ſo ſurely with their croſbowes / that non
durſte put out their heedes to their defence / for
the genoways croſbowes ſhotte ſo ſurely / that
lightly they myſt nat of their leuell / ſo that ther
were many within ſore hurte with their quarelles / 
in ſo moche that they doughted ſore the
ſhotte. This ſaute was ſo ſore contynued that
the mynours ouerthrewe a pane of the walle:
Than they within were ſore abaſſhed & wolde
than haue yelded them their / lyues ſaued / but
their enemyes had no luſte therto / for they felle
in to ſo good handes that they were all ſlayne.
for ſir Galtier their capitayne cōmaūded that
it ſhulde ſo be. ſo there were none taken to mercye / 
but all ſlayne / nat one that ſcaped. Thus
theſe lordes of Fraunce at their firſt comynge
had the caſtell of Forget / and ſir Gaultier delyuered
it to the owner therof / who loſte it the
ſame yere before for lacke of good kepyng / 
as dyuers other caſtelles
had bene before in
Fraunce.

and that ſir Gaultier had delyuered it
to ye owner / the knight newe repayred it where
as nede was / for the frenche men had ſore dyſtroyed
it in ye aſſayling therof or it were won.
Than they went to the caſtell of Baſſe / of whiche
Erualton of Batefoyle was capitayn / and
had greatly fortifyed it / for he thought the frenche
men wolde viſyte hym / as they dyde. And
whan the frenche men came thyder they layde
ſiege therto / and than aduyſed on whiche ꝑte
they might beſt for their aduauntage gyue aſſaute / 
and determyned on a place / and ſo on a
day they came to the ſaut on that parte as they
thought mooſt feble. There the Genowayes
croſbowes were ordayned to ſhote / and the aſſauters
behynde thē / and they acquyted them
ſelfe truely in doyng of their feate / for they ſhot
ſo rudely at them within / that non durſt ſhewe
thēſelfe. Erualton of Batefoyle was at ye gate
where there was a great aſſaute / and there he
dyde marueylous in armes / ſo moche / that his
enemyes ſayd among them ſelfe. Beholde yonder
is a ſquyer of great herte / on whome his
harneſſe is well enployed / for he valyantly defended
hym ſelfe. It were well done ſome bodye
to ſhewe hym / that it were beſt for hym to
yelde vp the caſtell / and to departe ſome where
elles / And to ſhewe hym that if ſir Gaultier of
Paſchac wynne hym parforce / ther is no man
can ſaue hym fro the dethe / for he hath ſworne
as many as he wynneth parforce / ſhall all dye
or be hanged. Than the ſeneſchall of Tholous
cōmaunded a ſquyer of Gaſcoyne called Wyllyam
Alyedell / who knewe ryght well Erualton / 
for he had ben dyuers tymes with hym in
armes as his companyon / and he was gladde
to go / for he was lothe that Erualton ſhulde haue
hadd any domage / if he myght do hym any
good: And ſo he came to the aſſaute and made
token / that he wolde ſpeke with Erualton for
his great profyte / and he anſwered he was content.
Than the ſaut reſted on that ſyde but nat
on the other parte: Than this Wylliam ſayd.
Erualton ye are happy / for certayne of yonder
lordes haue ſende me to you for they haue pyte
on you / for if ye be taken parforce there is no remedy

you to yelde vp ye fortreſſe / rather than to
abyde thaduēture: for of one thyng ye may be / 

ſure / we ſhall nat departe hens tyll ye be taken / 
Than Erualton ſayd / William / I knowe well
thoughe at this tyme ye be agaynſt me / that ye
wolde nat coūſayle me to any thyng to my diſhonour.
Knowe for trouthe that if I rendre vp
the holde / it ſhalbe ſo that I and all myne may
ſafely departe / and carye with vs as moche as
we maye / and to be ſafely conducted to the caſtell
of Lourde. On this condycion I wyll her
ken to you or elles nat. Sir quod Wylliam / I
haue nat ſo farre charge to commen with you / 
but gladly I ſhal ſpeke for you to my maiſters
And ſo he retourned to the ſeneſchall of Tholous
and ſhewed hym all theſe wordes / Than
ſir Hughe of Frodeuyll ſayd. Lette vs go and
ſpeke with ſir Gaultier / for I can nat tell what
he wyll do / ſithe I haue gone ſo farr in the mater
I wyll ſe what he will do. Than they came
to ſir Gaultier who was ſtyll at the ſaute / and
ſir Hughe of Frodeuyll ſayd. Sir Gaultier / 
I haue treated with the capitayne of the caſtel
and he is well wyllynge to yelde vp the caſtell
to vs as it is / ſo that he & all his maye go quite
with all that they maye cary with them / and to
be ſafely conducted to the caſtell of Lourde.
Therfore nowe ſir loke what ye wyll do / if we
ſhulde leſe one of our knightes or ſquyers / outher
by ſhotte or caſt of ſtones / or by any perylous
accident it ſhulde be gretter domage than
we can haue any profyte by puttyng of them to
dethe whan we haue won them / whiche is nat
yet / for or they be won it wyll coſte vs ſome of
our people. ſir that is true quod the ſeneſchall
of Carcaſſone / ſuche aſſautes can nat be without
ſome dethe and ſore hurtyng.
            TO thoſe wordes ſir Galtier of paſchac
ſayd. I am well cōtent / ceaſe the aſſaut
we haue more to do in other places. Thus lytell
and lytell we ſhall wynne the caſtelles that
theſe pyllers holde / though they departe nowe
with a good market. Paraduenture herafter
they maye fall agayne in our hādes / and than
one tyme they ſhall paye for all / euer yuell dedes
come to an yuell ende. In my dayes I haue
hanged and drowned of ſuche robbers fyue
hundred / and hereafter they ſhall come to the
fame pricke. Than they that went on this treatie / 
came agayne to the barryers to Erualton
Batefoyle: Than Wylliam ſaid / by my faithe
Erualton / you and all yours maye thāke god
and ſir Hughe of Frodeuyll / for he hath made
your treatie as ye demaunde. ye may departe
ſafely and all yours / and beare awaye as moche
as ye can / and ye ſhall be ſafely brought to
Lourde. Well quod Erualton I am contente / 
ſythe it wyll be no better. Knowe for trouthe
Wylliam / I ſhall departe fro this fortreſſe ſore
agaynſt my wyll / for I haue had great profite
therby / ſyth I was taken at the bridge at Turnay
beſyde Maluoyſin / by the Burge of ſpaygne / 
who had of me for my raūſome two thouſande
frankes. To ſaye trouthe / I haue well
recouered my ſelf here / and euer haue ben here
in theſe fronters whiche I loue well / for whan
ſo euer I rode forthe / lyghtely I founde ſome
good auēture / outher by ſome marchaūt of Robeſton
of Tholous / or of Rodes / for the mooſt
parte euer I gatte ſomwhat: Than Wylliam
ſayd / ſir I beleue you well / but and ye wyll become
frenche I vndertake ye ſhalbe clene pardoned / 
and to haue a thouſande frākes gyuen
you / and I wyll become youre ſuretie that ye
ſhalbe euer good frenche / if ye wyll ſwere your

but as for that I wyll nat / for I wyll be ſtill as
yet Englyſſhe: as god helpe me I can nat fynde
in my herte to be good frenche. Returne to
your company and ſhewe them that this daye
we wyll order oure buſyneſſe / and to morowe
in the mornyng we ſhall delyuer vp the caſtell / 
and departe / Wherfore ſe that oure conducte
be redy.
            So than ceaſſed the ſaute and the frenchemen
went to their lodgyngꝭ / and ſo paſſed the
night at their eaſe / they hadde well wherwith.
and in the mornyng whan euery man was redy
in the hooſt / & that they were redy yt ſhulde
conducte the cōpanyons to the caſtell of lourde
Than ſir Hughe Frodeuyll ſeneſchall of Tholous
went to take poſſeſſyon of the caſtell: and
whan he came to the caſtell / he founde Erualton
of Batefoyle and his company redy to departe / 
and had truſſed all that they wolde cary
Than a knight of Lourde called ſir Monant
of Salenges conueyed thē ſafely wheder they
wolde. Thus the caſtell of Baſſe was wonne / 
and a ſquyer of the countrey had the kepynge
therof gyuen hym / and of the countrey / who
was called Bertram of Monteſquyen. Than
theſe frēchmen went forthe and came to the caſtell
of Pulpuron / wherof the lytell Mechyne
was ſouerayne capitayn / who had done great
domage to the countre therabout / wherfore ſir
Galter of paſchac ſware by his fathers ſoule yt

                his ſiege. This caſtell ſtode on a rocke
a goodly caſtell to loke on / and there ſir Gaultier
ſware neuer to departe thens tyll he hadde
them at his pleaſure / the
                  •
                were many aſſautes
but they wan but lytell / for the caſtell was well
defended. Well quod ſir Galtier / I can nat tell
howe it wyll be. The frenche kynge is ryche ynough
to kepe a ſege here / but as for me I wyll
nat departe in one yere / without I haue the caſtell
at my pleaſure / & ſuche as were with hym
beleued hym well / and ordred them ſelfe therafter:
And I ſhall ſhewe you howe it fortued.
Whan the capitayns within ſawe ſurely howe
the frenchmen wolde nat deꝑte thens tyll they
had the caſtell / what ſoeuer it coſt them: Than
they douted thē / and aduyſed to departe thens
wheder the frēchmen wolde or nat / which they
might well do / for they hadde a caue that went
out of the caſtell vnder the groūde in to a wode
halfe a leage of: ſo whan Angerot capiteyne of
the caſtell ſawe the dealyng of the frenchmen / 
and knewe howe they had promiſed nat to deꝑte
thens tyll they had the caſtell / outher by famyne
or otherwiſe / than he douted and ſayd to
his companye. Sirs / Iſe well ſir Gaultier of
Paſchac hath vs greatly in hatered / & I feare
by longe ſiege he ſhulde famyſſhe vs / & that to
do he nedeth nat / but to make a baſtyde & let it
be kept but with a hūdred ſpeares ſo that none
of vs than dare deꝑte: Therfore I ſhall ſhewe
you what we ſhall do Lette vs take all that we
haue and in the nyght we wyll departe by this
caue vnder the erthe / which is fayre and great
and without faut it ſhall bring vs in to a wode
a leage hens / than ſhall we be out of all parell / 
for there is no man in the hoſt that knoweth it.
They all agreed to his counſayle / & in a night
whan they hadde all truſſed than they toke torches
and fagottes & entred in to the caue / whiche
was fayre and clere / and ſo they iſſued out
therof in to a wode halfe a leage fro the caſtell / 
Than the
                  •
                were ynowe that knewe the wayes
to other fortereſſes in Lymoſin and in Rouergue / 
and ſome of them whan they were oute of
all parelles / toke other wayes and ſayd / Howe
they wolde folowe the warres no lengar / Angerot
and fyue with hym wente to a towne and a
caſtell in Piergourt called Mountroyall / and
the lorde therof receyued hym ſwetely / for he &
all his landes were good englyſſhe / nor he wolde
neuer tourne frenche whan other dyd
howbeit there were dyuers other
of his opynion.
⸪
            THus they of the garyſon of Pulpuron
ſaued them ſelfe / and left no perſone be
hynde them / and were nere the
                  •
                as they wolde
be / or the frenchmen knewe of their deꝑtynge / 
The thirde day after their departyng / the frē
               chemen
ordayned to gyue aſſaut / and they had
made an ingyn with four ſtages / and in euery
ſtage there might be twentie croſ bowes: And
whan all was redy they ſet forthe this ingyn / 
the whiche they named / Paſſe on before to the
weykeſt ſyde of the caſtell / and the geno ways
within the ingyn: & whan it was there as they
wolde haue it / there they ſhotte agaynſt the caſtell
& no body dyde appere. Than anone they
parceyued that the caſtell was voyde / bycauſe
no body came to their defēce / than they ceaſſed
their ſhot bicauſe they wolde nat leſe their quarelles.
Than they came downe fro the ingyn &
came to ye capitayns who had marueyle what
they ment / and than they ſayd. Sirs / without
fayle there is no body within the caſtell. Howe
knowe you that quod ſir Gaultier? Sir quod
they we knowe it / for there is none appereth at
their defence for all our ſhot. Than the
                  •
                were
ordayned ladders to ſette vp agaynſt the walles / 
and they that moūted on them paſſed ouer
the walles and entred in to the caſtell / & founde
no creature therin: And than they wente to the
gate and there they founde a great bundell of
kayes / and among other they founde the kaye
of the gate and opyned it / and than all the barryers
one after another / wherof the lordes had
great marueyle / and ſpecially ſir Gaultier of
Paſchac / he wende they had ben deꝑted out of
the caſtell by enchaūtment / & than demaūded
of them that were about hym howe it might be
The ſeneſchall of Tholous ſayd to hym. Sir
ſurely they can nat be thus gone without they
haue ſome ſecrete waye vnder the erthe / which
I thynke there be. Thanne all the caſtell was
ſought in euery corner / where any ſuche waye
ſhulde be. There they founde in a Cellar the
mouthe of the alley open / and there all the lordes
dyde beholde it / and ſir Galtier had great
marueyle therof / and demaunded of the S
                  •

                  〈…〉
                ſir ꝙ he / I haue herde or this therof / 
but I thought nothyng that they wolde haue
thus departed by that waye. By my faythe
quod ſir Gaultier / they begone the ſame waye
Haue the caſtelles of this countre ſuche ordynaunce:
Sir quod ſir Hughe / there be dyuers
ſuche caſtelles as of olde tyme ꝑteyned to Raynalt
of Montabon / that hath ſuche cōueyaūce / 

for whan he and his bretherne kepte warre
agaynſt kynge Charlemayne of frannce they
were made all after this maner by the counſayle
and aduyſe of Maugis theyr coſyn / for
when ye kynge beſyeged them by puyſſaunce
and that they ſawe they coulde not reſyſt hym
then they wolde departe without ony leue takynge
by meanes of theſe paſſages vnder the
erthe. Surely ſayd ſyr Brews I lawde gretly
yt ordynaunce / I can not ſay yf euer I ſhall
haue ony warre agaynſt me or not other by
kynge duke / or by ony other neyghboure that
I haue / but as ſone as I am retourned in to
my countrey I ſhall cauſe ſuche a myne to be
made in my caſtell of Paſac. So thus they toke
poſſeſſyon of the caſtell and ſet therin men
of warre to kepe there a garyſon / and ſo then
they wente further towardes ye caſtell of Conuall
where Eſpaygnolet of papereaw baſque
was capytayne & with hym a good nombre of
theſe pyllers and robbers.
            SO theſe lordes and theyr company came
to the garyſon of Conuall in Robeſtan
and layde ſyege therto / & then ſyr Gaultyer
demaunded of the ſeneſhall of Tholous
yf Conuall auncyently perteyned to raynalte
of Monutalban / & he ſayd yes / then there is a
caue vnder the grounde ſayd ſyr Gaultyer / ſyr
that is true ſayd ſyr Brews for by reaſon ther
of Eſpaygnolet wanne it the ſeconde tyme &
the owner within it / then fyr Gaultyer ſente
for ye knyght that was owner therof & ſayd to
hym / ſyr it were good ye enfourmed vs of the
myne yt is out of this caſtell & the yſſue therof
Then ſyr Raymonde of Conuall ſayd / ſyr ſurely
there is a way vnder the grounde for ther
by I was taken and loſt this my caſtel / it was
before of longe tyme decayed & deſtroyed but
theſe robbers newe repayred it / and by yt way
they came on me / and ſyr the yſſue therof is in
a wood not farre hence / wel ſayd ſyr Gaultyer
all is well / and ſo .iiii. dayes after he wente to
the ſame wood & had with hym .CC. men wel
armed / and when he ſawe the hole where the
yſſue was he cauſed the erthe and buſſhes to
be auoyded / and then he lyghted vp many fagottes
and ſayd to them yt were ordeyned to
go into the caue / ſyr folowe this caue & it ſhal
brynge you in to the hall of Conuall and there
ye ſhal fynde a dore breke it vp ye are ſtronge
ynough ſo to do and to fyght with them with
in / ſo they entred and came to ye grece nere to
the hall dore in ye caſtell / then with grete axes
they ſtrake at the dore & by yt tyme it was nere
nyght / they within the caſtell made good watche
& perceyued howe by the myne they wolde
haue entred in to the caſtell and Eſpaygnolet
was goynge to his reſt / then he came thyder / 
and there they caſt ſtones / benches / and tymbre
before the caue dore to ye entente that none
ſholde entre there thoughe the dore were broken
vp. This was done for other ſhyfte had
they none of defence / but for all that they with
in the myne anone brake the dore all to peces / 
and yet wer. neuer the nere / for then they had
more to do then they had before / and whē they
ſawe it was impoſſible for them to entre there
they retourned agayne to the ooſt / and by that
tyme it was myduyght / thē they ſhewed what
they had founde & howe they of Conuall had
perceyued them and had ſo fortefyed the caue
dore that it was not poſſyble to entre by that
way in to the caſtell.
         
         
            ¶Howe the caſtelles of Conuall / of
Bygore and of Meſnyll were taken
and all they within taken ſlayne and
hanged. Ca. xxxix.
            
               THen ſyr Gaultyer of Paſchat
ſente to Baſſe for the
grete engyne whiche was
taken downe and brought
thyther & rayſed vp on his
wheles as it ſholde be / and
alſo they apparelled other
inſtrumentes for ye aſſawre / and when al was
redy then ſyr Gaultyer who gretly deſyred to
wynne this caſtell cauſed his Trompettes to
ſowne to the aſſawte / there was the ſeneſhall
of Tholouſe with his company on ye one ſyde
and ſyr Roger of ſpayne ſeneſhal of Carcaſſō
on the other ſyde / alſo there was the lorde of
Barbaran / ſyr Benedic and lorde of Benoch / 
the lorde of the countye of Deſterac / ſyr Raymonde
of lyſle and other knyghtes and ſquyers
of the countrey / then they began the ſawte
and they within to defende themſelfe whiche
was nede for they ſawe themſelfe in a harde
parte / they knewe wel how ſyr Gaultyer wolde
take none to mercy / therfore they thought
to defende themſelfe as longe as they myght &
to ſell theyr lyues derely / there the Geneways
croſſe bowes ſhot ſore and hurte many within
ſo that there were none within but doubted
gretely / and there ſyr Gaultyer of Paſac dyd

meruayles in armes and ſayd to his company / 
what ſyr
                  •
                ſhall theſe raſcalles holde vs in
hande all this daye thus / yf it were agaynſte
good men of armes I wolde not meruayle / for
in them were mo feaces of warre then in theſe
raſcalles that be within. It is myne entent to
dyne within the caſtell. Nowe it ſhall be ſene
yf ye wyll accomplyſſhe my deſyre / with thoſe
wordes ſuche as deſyred his good wyl aduaū
               ced
themſelfe forthe / they toke many ladders &
ſet them vp agaynſt the wall where as the engyne
ſtode with the croſſe bowes / who ſhot ſo
fyerſly that none within durſt ſhew themſelfe
Thus by clene aſſawte ye Frenſſhe men entred
in to ye caſtel of Conual theyr ſwordes in theyr
handes chaſynge theyr enemyes / & there were
many ſlayne & the other taken / then euery mā
entred in at ye gates / then it was demaunded
of ſyr Gaultyer what ſholde be done with thē
that were taken. By ſaynt George ſayd he / I
wyll they be all hanged / and incontynent his
commaundement was done / and Eſpaygnoy
let began fyrſt. So the lordes dyned in the caſtel / 
and the other people in the towne / & there
they taryed all that day
                  •
               . And ſyr Gaultyer delyuered
agayne to ye lorde of Conuall his towne
& caſtell / & then ordeyned to departe thens.
            THus after the takynge of the caſtell of
Conuall as ye haue herde / the Frenſſh
men wente to another holde called Maſtull
whiche had done grete domage to ye countrey
with other & there they made aſſawte / & they
wtin defended themſelfe / but yt was not longe
for by clene aſſawte they were wonne and the
caſtell alſo / and all that was within ſlayne &
hanged vp. And when they of Ratchfort and
of other caſtelles knewe howe ſyr Gaultyer
had wonne ſo many caſtelles / and that he toke
none to mercy / but outher ſlayne or hanged / 
they doubted moche for comynge to the ſame
ende / wherfore they departed in ye nyght tyme
I can not tell whether they wente vnder the
grounde or aboue / for bytwene ye caſtell of Rochefort
and the caſtell of Royr were caues vnder
the erthe / for auncyently they perteyned to
Raynolde of Mountalban. So the Frenſſhmen
founde theſe caſtelles clene voyde when
they came thyder / then they newely repeopled
it with men of warre & prouyſyon. Then they
toke theyr way towarde Tholous to go in to
Bygore / for on ye fronter of Tarbe there were
two caſtelles the one called Thedos Iulyan / 
and the other Nauaret whiche gretely trauayled
the countrey and ye good towne of Tarbe
and the londes of the lorde Dauchyn.
            
               WHen ſyr Gaultyer of Paſac and the lordes
of Fraunce and of Languedoc had
well refreſſhed theym in the Cyte of
Tholous then they departed & toke the waye
in to Bygore / and ſo came before the caſtell of
ledos Iuly ā / & there taryed & ſayd they wolde
goo no further tyll they had wonne it / thyder
came to ſyr Gaultyer of Paſac ye Seneſhal of
Nob
                  •
               ſan perteynynge to the Erle of Foys for
ſyr Gaultyer had ſente for hym to helpe to dryue
out of the countrey the pyllers and robbers
who had renne as well in the countrey of Nobeſſan
as in other places. Alſo ye Erle of Foys
conſented that he ſholde ſo do / or elles he durſt
not haue done ſo / they were before dos Iulyā
xv. dayes or they had it / yt caſtell was ſtronge
and a good capytayne therin a ſquyer of Gaſcoyn
called Bruer de Brome. ¶Howbeit
they at the laſt hadde it / not by aſſawte / but by
treaty / they within departed theyr lyues and
goodes ſaued. And alſo they were falſely conuayed
to Lowrde by a ſquyre called Bertram
of Mountdyghen. And when theſe lordes of
Fraunce had Dos Iulyen then they toke aduyſe
whether they myght kepe it ſtyll or raſe
it downe to the erthe / then it was counſayled
to bete it downe bycauſe of them of Lowrde
who were crafty and ſubtyle / fearynge yt whē
they ſholde be gone that they wolde wynne it
agayne / ſo it was better downe and as yet the
ſtones lye on a hepe & lykely neuer to be buylded
agayne / thus became of Dos Iulyan / thē
they wente before Nauaret wherin there was
alſo companyons aduēturers who had kepte
it more then a yere / & when they knewe howe
they of dos Iulyā were departed in lyke wyſe
dyde they and had a ſaufconduyte & wente to
lowrde whiche was theyr chefe refuge for they
knewe well no man wolde ſeke thē there with
out they wolde leſe theyr payne for ye caſtell of
Lowrde was impoſſyble to be taken by force.
            
               WHen the Frenſſhe men had raſed the
caſtel of Dos Iulyā / then they wente
to Nauaret and founde it all voyde / 
then it was ordeyned to be beten downe & ſo it
was / Wherof they of Tarbe were nothynge
myſcontent / for yt garyſon had done thē grete
domage / then they wente to the caſtell of Dauchen
in Bygore ſtandynge amonge the mountaynes
in the entre of Byerne. And there they

were a .xv. dayes and in that ſeaſon made dyuers
aſſawtes and wanne the baſe courte and
al theyr horſes / but there was a ſtronge towre
on the rocke yt coulde not be wonne. And whē
the lordes ſawe howe they loſt there but theyr
payne / & yt Wyllyam Morenton who kepte ye
holde wolde not yelde it vp / nor ſell it / nor herkē
to no treatye / thē they departed & retourned
to Tarbe / & then ſyr Ganltyer of Paſſac gaue
leue to all his men of warre to departe / & they
were payde of theyr wages / or had ſuffycyent
ſygnement / ſo yt they were pleaſed / & he wente
to Carcaſſon and theraboute / and refreſſhed
hym. And whyle he lay there / tydynges came
to hym out of Fraunce and a cōmaundement
fro the kynge that he ſholde drawe to the garyſon
of Bounteuyll Xainton on the marches of
Burdeloys & Poyctou / whiche garyſon was
kepte by a capytayne called Saynt Foy a gaſcoyne.
And it was ſayd in fraunce yt ſyr Iohn̄
Harpedan ſeneſhall of Burdeaus made a grete
aſſemble of men of warre at Lyborne to rayſe
the baſtydes yt they of Poictou & of Xainton
hadde layde before Bounteuyll. To the kynges
commaundement obeyed ſyr Gaultyer as
it was reaſon and toke with hym a .lx. ſperes
and a .C. croſſe bowes Geneuoys / and ſo departed
fro Carcaſſon / & paſſed by Rouergue / 
Agen / and coſted Pierregourt and ſo came to
Bounteuyll and founde there the ſeneſhalles
of Rochel / of Poictou / of Pierregourt / and of
Dagen and a grete nombre of men of warre.
¶In farre countres it maye be well meruayled

wolde haue had it none otherwyſe to

othe nor promyſe to ony man / true it was of ye

gete no maner of offyce in theyr coun

               rees / for
the Englyſſhemen ſayd they were not worthy

grudged in theyr myndes / and when they myght
they ſhewed it for bycauſe of the hardnes
that ye Erle of Armynacke & the lorde Dalbret
founde in ye prince / they forſoke hym & became
Frenſſhe / & ſo dyde dyuers other knyghtes &

longer contynewe / he made a maryage bytwene
the ſyſter of the lady Iſabell of Burbon / &
the lorde Dalbret / & bytwene them were fayre
chyldren / & for this cauſe the loue endured the
longer / & on a tyme at Paris where as I was
I herde the lorde Dalbret ſpeke a worde / whiche
I well noted / but I byleue he ſpake it but
in ſporte / howbeit he ſpake it in grete ſadnes
to a knyght of Brytayne who had ſerued hym
before / for the knyght had demaunded hym of
ye buſynes of his countrey / & howe he was contente
to be frenſſhe / he anſwered and ſayd / I
thanke god I do metely well / howbeit I had
more money / & my mē alſo / whē we made war
for the kynge of Englonde then we haue now
for when we rode forthe at aduenture we foū

was no day but we gate cuer ſome good pray

Then we were freſſhe & Ioly / & nowe we be
as deed then the knyght began to laughe and
ſayd truely this is a lyfe of Gaſcoynes / lyghtly
they wolde euer haue other mēnes domage
Therfore I that harde theſe wordes ſay as I
thought yt the lorde Dalbret repented hym in
yt he was become frenſſhe as ye lorde of Muſydent
Gaſcoyne who was taken at the batayle
of Anne
                  •
                / & ſware in to the handes of the duke
of Aniow yt he wolde come to Parys / and become
frenſſhe euer after / ſo he came to Paris &
kynge Charles made hym good chere / but for
all yt euer the kynge dyd / ye lorde of Muſydent
departed agayne fro Parys without ony leue
& wente in to his coūtrey & became agayne Englyſſhe / 
& brake all ye promyſes yt he had made
with the duke of Aniow. In lykewyſe ſo dyde
the lorde of Rouſen / the lorde of Duras / & the
lorde of Languerant. Suche is the nacyon of
Gaſcoyne they be not ſtable / for they loue yet
the Englyſſhe men better then the frenſſhemē
for theyr warre agaynſt ye Frenſſhe men were
more profytabe for them then agaynſt the Englyſſhe
men / this is the pryncypall incydent yt
mooſt inclyneth them therto.

in ye empyre of Hūgry & made warre agaynſt
the turkes & tartaryes / there by his valyauntnes
he conquered on the Tartaryes / & on the
Sowdans lande two good townes / as Calipole /

is a harde caſe for the tyme to come / for the

more feble & the lyghter to be dyſtroyed / & condempned / 
they lay therto reaſon in yt they that
ſholde cxalte the cryſten fayth / are ye fyrſt that

               ded
of the kynge of Armony whether that the
Sowdan / & the Tacon of tartarie were .ii. of
the gretteſt prynces amonge the infydelles yt
were knowen with the Grekes / the kynge anſwered
& ſayd / nay ſurely / they be not ye greteſt
for alwayes the turkes are more noble / more
greter / more ſage / & more redoubted in warre
as longe as they haue a good heed and gouernour / 
as they haue had this .C. yere / for thoughe
ye Tacon of Tartarie holde in ſubieccyon
the Emperoure of Conſtantyne le noble / yet ye
lorde of Turkey holdeth in lykewyſe ye Tacō
& this lorde of Turkey is called Lamorabaqum /

in armes / & a wyſe man in his lawe of Lamorabaquin
I cōplayne me not / for he neuer dyd
me hurte / for he hath alwayes kepte his warre
agaynſt the Emperoure of Hungery. Then ye
lordes of Fraunce demaunded of hym yf this
Lamorabaqum were ſo grete / & ſo feared as
he ſayd / ye truely ſayd the kynge of Armony /

               gery
feareth hym in lykewyſe doth the Sowdan
of Babylon / & the Tacon of Tartarie / &
as I haue herde ſay of ye Tartaryes / yt Tacon
wolde or this tyme further haue put vnder ye
Emperoure of Conſtantyne le noble / but for
doubte of Lamorabaqum / ye Tacon knoweth
hym & his nature ſo well / for as ſone as he knoweth
one gretter then hymſelfe / he wyll neuer
haue ioy tyl he haue put hym vnder / Wherfore
the Tacon wyll not do to Cōſtantyne le noble
yt he myght well do yf he wolde / then he was
demaunded yf this Lamorabaquin had ony
grete power of men / ye kynge ſayd / ye ſurely / 
for in .xxx. yere where ſoeuer he wente / he had
euer in his company a .C.M. horſes alwayes
lodged in ye feldes / and neuer entreth in to ony
towne / & for his garde he hath euer .xx.M. turkes

                  •
                whereſo euer he goeth he hath his fader

language / & ſuche as cometh thens / he deſyreth
to ſe all the grete lordes of ye worlde / & ye
frenſſhe kynge & his eſtate & ordre / & one ſpeke
to hym of Fraunce he is well content. Then ye
kynge was demaūded why ye Lamorabaqum
ſuffred ye Tacon in peas ſyth he was ſo grete
an Emperour / bycauſe ſayd ye kynge yt the Tacon
feareth hym & dare make hym no warre / &
alſo there be certayne townes & portes in Tartarie
yt yerely payeth trybute to Lamorabaquin / 
& alſo they are al of one lawe / & they wyl
not lyghtly dyſtroy theyr owne lawe / & he meruayleth
gretely of ye warre amonge cryſtē mē
howe eche of them dyſtroyeth other / wherfore
he is often in mynde to come in to cryſtēdome
& to wyn all before hym I wolde he had won
my lāde rather thē ye Tacon / for it had ben better
for me / he was demaūded why / & he anſweſwered
& ſayd. Lamorabaquin is a lorde of noble
cōdycyon / & yf he were .xxx. yere yonger he
were lykely to make grete cōqueſtes where as
he wolde employ his warre / for when he hath
wonne a countrey / towne / or ſygnory / he deſyreth
nothynge but truage / & leueth ſtyll euery
man in his owne byleue / & he putteth neuer no
mā fro his herytage / he deſyreth nothynge but
the ſouerayne domynacyon / Wherfore I ſaye
yf he had conquered ye royalme of Armony / as
the Tartaries haue ſuffered me in peas / & my

gynge hym as my ſouerayne / as other grete
lordes do / yt marche nere hym / as the Grekes &

of the Sowdan / & of the Tacon of

Palice / & the lorde of Hawlte lodge / theſe
.iii. lordes & theyr landes are in peas by reaſon
of a truage yt they pay to Lamorabaquin / ther
is no Turke nor Tartarien yt dare do thē ony
wronge or domage / then it was demaūded of
ye kynge of Armony yf his lande were ſo clerely
loſt that it myght not be recouered agayne / 
truely ſayd the kynge it is without recouery / 
without the puyſſaunce of cryſtendome come
thyder ſtronger thē the Turkes & Tartaries
for as I haue ſayd / the ferther they come forwarde / 
more they are lykely to cōquere / for excepte
one towne called Courth / whiche is the
fyrſt towne of the royalme of Armony / & is as
yet in the cryſten mennes handes / al ye reſydue
of ye royalme is in ye infydels handes / & where
as ye chyrches were wonte to be / there they ſet
vp theyr ydolles & theyr mawmettes / then it
was demaunded if the towne of Courth were
ſtronge / ye truely ſayd ye kynge / it wyll not be

wonne without it be by lōge ſyege / or elles betrayed / 
for it ſtandeth nere to the ſee in a drye
place bytwene .ii. rockes / whiche cā not be approched / 
for yf yt Turkes or Tartaries had it
in theyr hādes & another good towne not ferre
thens called Adelphe / all Grece were dyſtroyed / 
& Hungery ſholde haue moche a do. Then
it was demaunded yf Hungery marched nere
to Tartarie & to the Turkes / the kynge ſayd / 
ye truely & nerer to the Turkes & Lamorabaquin
then to ony other / then the lordes ſayd / it
is grete meruayle ye Lamorabaquin ſuffereth
hym to be in reſt ſyth he marcheth ſoo nere to
Hungery / & he beynge ſo valyaunt a man & ſo
grete a conquerour. In the name of god ſayd
the kynge of Armony / or this tyme he hath ſtudyed
as moche as he myght how to haue done
domage to the royalme of Hungery / & yf an incydent
had not ben or this / he had ben farre in

& ſhewed hym what was wtin it / & when ye erle
of Lazaran vnderſtode ye ambaſſadoure of Lamorabāquin / 
& determyned in hymſelfe to anſwere
temporatly / & wolde not dyſcouer his
thought ſodaynly but ſayd / cloſe vp ye ſacke I
ſe ryght wel what is therin / & I haue well harde
what thynge Lamorabaquin demaundeth

               ſwere they taryed there .iii.

& hēnes & cloſed thē vp in to a houſe wtout
ony maner of mete / ſo yt in .iii. dayes they etc
no thynge / And when the daye came that he

wolde anſwere the ambaſſadours / thē he ſent
for them in to a galary lokynge downe in to a
courte & ſayd / ſyrs come hyder and leane here
with me / & I ſhal ſhewe you a newe thynge / &
ſo anſwere you / & they knowynge not what he
wolde doo / leaued downe in a wyndowe by
hym / then the gates were cloſed / & the courte
was grete / ſo his men were redy to doo as he
had ordeyned / then they opened a chambre dore
or .II. where as all the pollayne were yt had
eten no mete of .ii. dayes before. Then the ſeruauntes
toke the grayne yt was in the ſacke / &
caſt it all aboute before the capons & hennes / 
ſo yt within halfe an houre al the corne was etē
vp clene / & wolde haue eten more yf they had
had it / then the erle ſayd to the meſſagers / ſyrs
ye haue ſene howe this grayne whiche you haue
brought hyder from your mayſter is clene
eten / & deuoured / and brought to no thynge by
theſe pollayne / and yet they wolde ere more yf
they had it yt is trueſyr ſayd they / wherby ſpeke
you yt / I ſay ſayd ye erle your anſwere lyeth
therin / as by enſāple ye haue ſene / Lamoraba
quin ſayth yt yf I obey hym not he wyl brynge
in to my lande men of armes without nombre
wherfore ſay vnto hym fro me / I wyl abyde it
& he ſhall not brynge ſo many / but they ſhal be
al deuoured as this corne is deuoured by this
pollayne.
            
               WHen the ambaſſadours harde this an
ſwere they were ryght penſyue / & ſo
toke theyr leue & departed / & dyde ſo
moche by theyr iourneys yt they came to Lamorabaquin
& ſhewed hym what the erle ſayd
ſaynge by ſemynge he ſet but lytell by his manaſſyng / 
wt this anſwere Lamorabaquin was
ſore dyſpleaſed / & ſayd howe the matter ſholde
not reſt ſo / but whether the erle wolde or not / 
he wolde entre in to his coūtre & in to hūgery
& how he wolde dyſtroy the erles countrey by
cauſe he anſwered hym ſo preſumptuouſly.
¶Nowe ſhall I ſhewe you what the crle dyd
for he ſawe well he was defyed of Lamorabaquin / 
& knew wel he ſholde ſhortely here other
tydynges of hym therfore he made prouyſyon
to defende hym / & wrote to al knyghtes & ſquyers / 
& to other to come to hym to ſtoppe the entre
of Lamorabaquin in to Hungery / cōmaundynge
euery man after the ſyght of his letters
to drawe to hym / certefyenge thē howe Lamorabaquin
was as then in ye playnes of Haulte
loge / all ſuche as the erle ſente for obeyed wyllyngly / 
& ſo came to the erle to defende cryſten
dome / & dyuers came to hym yt were not ſente
for / ſuche as harde therof / to exalte cryſten faythe / 
& to dyſtroy ye infydelles. Alſo the erle Lazaran
cauſed foreſtes & hyghe trees to be hewē
downe / and layde trauers one ouer another / 
wherby the Turkes ſholde not fynde out ony
newe way / & then he with all his power came
to a certayne paſſage / where as Lamorabaquin
ſholde paſſe / to entre in to Hungery / the
erle had with hym a .x.M. men of Hungery &
x .M. croſſe bowes & dyd ſet thē on bothe ſides
of the way. And alſo he had redy .ii.M. mē of
the countre hauynge grete axes to cut downe
the trees when he wolde haue them / & when al
this was done / then he ſayd to them yt were aboute
hym / ſyrs without doubte Lamorabaquin
wyl come / ſyth he ſente me worde he wolde
do ſo / therfore ſyrs quyte yourſelfe well &
valyauntly to kepe & defende this paſſage / for
yf yt Turkes wynne it al Hungery is in grete

thoughe Lamorabaquin be a noble wyſe man

            LAmorabaquin forgate not his entrepryſe / 
but ſayd how he wolde go vyſyte
the lande of the erle of Lazaran / to his grete
domage / for he wolde not be reputed for a lyer

he ſayd to thē / ſyrs go your waye wt

in to Hūgery / & entre in to ye lāde of ye erle
of Lazaran / & dyſtroye it / & as ſoone as I may
know ye ye be there I ſhal come thyder to you
with all ye reſydue of my people / for I wyl put
all Hungery vnder my ſubiectyon / & after the
royalme of Almayne / the enchauntours of my
countrey & of Egypte ſaye it is my deſteny to
be lorde and kynge of all the worlde / & the place
that I wolde mooſt gladlyeſt ſe is Rome / 
for auntyently it was of our enherytaūce / for

our predeceſſours cōquered & gouerned it dyuers
tymes / & there I wyll be crowned / & Galafre
of Landas / the racon of Tartarye / & the
Sowdan of Babylone ſhal crowne me / then
they who were before hym on theyr knees anſwered
& ſayd / ſyr we ſhall accomplyſſhe your
deſyre: & cōmaundement / & ſo they departed wt
a .lx.M. Turkes / amonge whom there were
.xx.M. of the mooſt experte men of warre and
beſt armed of all Turkye / & they ledde the vowarde.
So longe they iourneyed yt they came
in amonge the mountaynes of Lazaryn they
founde no let in the entrynge in to y• countrey
ſo ye vowarde entred in / & the duke of Mecque
& the duke of Daniuet ledde them / & ſo this vowarde
paſſed the Erle of Lazaryus enbuſſhement / 
& when the erle & the Hungeryons ſawe
theyr tyme they ſet theyr worke mē a worke to
cut downe trees & to ſtoppe ſo ye wayes yt there
coulde no mo entre / nor they that were comen
in to recule they were ſo cloſed in yt it was not
poſſyble for ony mā to go ony further / ſo there
was thus encloſed a .xxx.M. turkes / who we
refyerſly aſſayled by the Hungaryons / and ſo
handeled on bothe ſydes of the way that they
were there all ſlayne / not one yt ſkaped / & the
.ii. dukes alſo ſlayne / ſome thought to haue ſaued
themſelfe in the woodes / but they were ſo
chaſed yt they were all ſlayne / then they of the
areregarde tourned backe whē they ſaw they
coulde not entre for the trees yt ſtopped ye way
ſo they retourned to Lamorabaqum & ſhewed
hym the grete myſchef yt was fallē on his
people / wherof he was meruayllous ſory and
dyſpleaſed / thē he called his coūſayle to know
what was beſt for hym to do / for he had loſt ye
floure of all his chyualry / and ſo retourned &
dyd no more at that tyme.
            
               WHen ye kynge of Armony had ſhewed
all this / & his owne eſtate to the frenſhe
kynge / & to the barons of Fran̄ce
& to his counſayle / they had of hym grete pyte
and bycauſe he was come fro ſo ferre a coūtre
as Grece to ſeke counſayle & ayde there / & bycauſe
he was a kynge & chaſed out of his royalme / 
and had as then no thynge to lyue on to
maynteyne his eſtate. ¶The frenſſhekynge
as yonge as he was ſayd / we wyl yt the kynge
of Irmony who is come hyder to ſe vs in hope
to haue ſome cōforte / helpe & ayde of vs to kepe
his eſtate as it aperteyneth to hym / who is
a kyng as wel as we be / & whē we may weſhal
ayde hym wt men of warre / & helpe to recouer
his 
                  •
               herytaūce wherto we haue good wyl / for
we are bounde to exalte ye cryſten faythe. The
frenſſhe kynges wordes were well harde and
vnderſtande / as it was reaſon / & there were
none yt ſayd the contrary / the kynges vncles &
counſayle were deſyrous to accomplyſſhe his
entent / ſo the kynge of Armony to maynteyne
his eſtate there was aſſygned to hym a certayne
rente & reuenues out of the chambre of accomptes / 
& ſo was well & truely payde euery
moneth / his aſſygnement was a .vi.M. frankes
by the yere / & he had delyuered hym at the
fyrſt .v.M. frākes to prouide for his lodgyng
veſſel & other thynges neceſſary / & his lodgynge
apoynted at ſaynt Andon beſyde ſaynt Denyce
there to kepe his houſe. Thus ye kynge
of Armony was reteyned by ye Frenſſhe kyng
at his fyrſt comynge / & dayly he encreaſed / &
not apayred / & was ſomtyme with the frenſſhe
kynge / and ſpecyally at hyghe feeſtes.

            I Knowe ryght well that in tyme to come

               nlumyned the harte of them yt were gone out
of the ryght way / & helde them ferme in vnyte
elles our fayth had be gretely defourmed / but
the grete lordes of the erthe at the begynnyng
dyd nothynge but laughe at the chyrche / tyl I
Cronycled theſe Cronycles in the yere of our
lorde Iheſu Cryſt .M.CCC.lxxx. and .x. moche
of the comon people meruayled howe the
grete lordes as the Frenſſhe kynge / the kynge
of Almayne / and other kynges and prynces of
cryſtendome / dyd prouyde no remedy in that
caſe. There was one thynge reaſonable to appeaſe
the comon people / & to eſcuſe the hyghe
prynces & kynges / dukes & Erles / & other lordes.
As by enſample the yolke of the egge can
not be without the whyte / nor the whyte with
out the yolke / no more maye the Clergy & the
lordes be one without another / for the lordes
are gouerned by ye Clergy / or they coulde not
lyue but as beeſtes & the Clergy were not / & ye
Clergy counſayleth and exhorteth the lordes
to do as they do. And I ſay ſurely I haue ben
in my tyme in dyuers partyes of the worlde / 
what for to accomplyſſhe my pleaſure / and to
ſe noueltyes in the worlde / and to haue knowledge
of the conqueſtes & aduentures wryten
in this boke. And truely the ſeaſon yt I wente
thus aboute in the worlde I coulde lyghtly ſe
no grete lorde / but that he had a marmoſet / or
of ye Clergy / or a boy of ſymple lygnage mounted
vp to honoure / by reaſon of theyr Iangelyng
& raylynge / excepte the erle of Foys / for
he had neuer none ſuche / for he was naturally
ſage / for his wyſdome was better / than ony yt
coulde be gyuen hym / yet I ſay not that ſuche
lordes as are ruled by ſuche marmoſettes be
fooles / but rather more then fooles / for they be
ſore blynded / & yet they haue two eyen / whan
the knowledge came fyrſt to ye frenſſhe kynge
Charles of the dyfference bytwene theſe two
popes he dyd put the matter on ye Clergy whiche
way he ſholde take them / they of the clergy
of Fraunce determyned & toke pope Clement
for the mooſt ſureſt parte / and to the Frenſſhe
opynyon acorded the kynge of Caſtel and the
kynge of Scottes bycauſe all the ſeaſon that
the ſcyſme was thus in the chyrche / Fraunce / 
Caſtell & Scotlande were ioyned togyder by
alyaunce / & the kynge of Englonde / & ye kynge
of Portyngale were of the contrary oppynyō
agaynſt theyr enemyes / the erle of Flaundres
neuer inclined in his courage to pope Clemēt
yt he ſholde be ryght pope bycauſe Vrbā was
fyrſt choſen at Rome / who was archebyſſhop
of Bare. This Clement beynge Cardynall
of Geane wrote lettres vnto the noble Erle of

Flaunders howe there was a pope choſen by
due electyon at Rome & named Vrban / wherfore
he wolde not byleue after on yt Clement / &
as longe as he lyned he was of that opynyon / 
ſo was the kynge of Almayne and all the Empyre / 
and alſo ye kynge of Hungry. Thus then
I put in wrytynge the ſtate and dyfferences yt
I had ſene in my dayes in the worlde and in ye
chyrche / it was no meruayle thoughe ye lordes
of the worlde ſuffered & dyſſymuled ye matter.
This brought to my remembraunce howe yt
when I was but yonge / and pope Innocent
caygned in Auygnyon / he helde in pryſon a
freer mynoure called freer Iohn̄ Roche Tayllad / 
this clerke as it was ſayd / & I haue herde
it pryuely in dyuers places / he ſhewed & aledged
dyuers auctorytes of the incydentes and
fortunes yt fell after in his dayes in ye royalme
of Fraunce. And alſo he ſpake of the takynge
of kynge Iohn̄ / and ſhewed certayne thynges
reaſonable howe the chyrche ſholde ſuffre moche
for ye grete ſuperfluytes yt he ſawe in them
and while he was in priſon it was ſhewed me
what he ſayd to the Cardynall of Oſtie called
Dearras / and to ye Cardynall of Auxere who
wente to vyſyte hym and to argue with hym / 
thē he layde to them an enſample as hereafter
ye ſhall here.
            LOrdes ſayd this freer / there was ones
a fowle appered in this worlde without
ony fethers / & when al other fowles knew
yt he was borne they came to ſe hym bicauſe he
was ſo fayre and pleaſaunt to beholde. Then
they ymagyned amonge them what they myght
do for this byrde / for without fethers they
knewe well he coulde not lyue / and they ſayd
they wolde he ſholde lyue bycauſe he was ſo
fayre / thē euery fowle there gaue hym of theyr
fethers / and the fayrer byrde the mo fethers he
gaue hym / ſo that then he was a fayre byrde &
a well fethered and began to fle. And ye byrdes
that had gyuen hym of theyr fethers whē they
ſawe hym flee they toke grete pleaſure / & whē
this byrde ſawe hymſelfe ſo well fethered and
that all other fowles honoured hym / he began
to ware prowde and toke no regarde of them
that had made hym / but pycked and ſpurred
at them and was contrary to them. Then the
other byrdes drewe togyder and demaunded
eche other what was beſt to be done with this
byrde that they had made vp of nought & now
ſo dyſdayneth them / then the Pecocke ſayd / he
is gretly beautyed by reaſon of my fethers / I
wyl take them agayne fro hym / in the name of
good ſayd the Fawcon ſo wyll I haue myne / 
and ſo ſayd al the other byrdes. And then they
began to take agayne fro hym al the fethers yt
they had gyuen hym. And whē this byrde ſaw
that / he humbled hymſelfe & knowledged of ye
welth and honour that he had / not of hymſelfe
but of them / for he knewe that he came in to ye
worlde naked and bare / and ye fethers that he
had they myght wel take fro hym agayne whē
they lyſt / then he cryed them mercy / and ſayd
that he wolde amende hymſelfe and noo more
be prowde / & ſo then agayne theſe gentyll byrdes
had pyte on hym & fethered hym agayne / 
& ſayd to hym we wolde gladly ſe ye f
                  •
               e amōge
vs / ſo thou wylte be humble as thou oughteſt
to be / but knowe ſurely / If thou be ony more
prowde and dyſdaynous we wyll take from yu
all thy fethers and ſet the as we founde yu fyrſt
¶Thus ſayd ye freer Iohn̄ ye Cardynalles
that were in his preſence. Syrs thus ſhall it
fall on you of the chyrche / for the Emperour of
Rome and of Almayne and the other kynges
cryſtened / & hyghe prynces of the worlde haue
gyuen you the goodes & poſſeſſyons & ryches

of ſaynt Sylueſter pope of Rome after ſaynt
Peter / ymagyne and conſyder howe the Emperour
Cōſtantyne gaue hym fyrſt ye dyſmes
of ye chyrche and on what condycyon. Saynt
Sylueſter rode nother with .CC. nor .CCC
horſe abrode in the worlde / but he helde hymſelfe
ſymply cloſed in Rome / and lyued ſoberly
with them of the chyrche / when the aungell
of god ſhewed hym how ye Emperour Couſtā
               tyne
who was as then but an infydell ſholde
fende for hym / in lykewyſe the Emperour had
it by reuelacyon of an aungell that Sylueſter
ſholde ſhewe hym ye way of helthe / for he was
ſyke of the lypper / ſo yt his fleſſ he fell in peces
& whē Sylueſter came before hym he ſhewed
hym the way of baptyme / & ſo cryſtened hym / 
and incontynent he was hole / for the whiche ye
Emperoure Conſtantyne byleued in god and
all his Empyre / and gaue to Sylueſter & to
the chyrche all the dyſmes / for before the Emperoure
of Rome helde them / and beſyde that
gaue hym many fayre gyftes & grete ſygnyoryes
augmentynge out fayth and the chyrche
but it was his entencyon that the goodes and
ſyguyoryes that he had gyuē hym yt he ſholde
gouerne it humbly and truely / and not to ſpē
               de
it in pompe and pryde / but nowe a dayes

they of the chyrche do the contrary wherwith
god is dyſpleaſed / and hereafter wyll be more
dyſpleaſed / ſo that the grete lordes of the erthe
wyll ware colde in theyr deuocyons / and not
be ſo lyberall in gyuynge ony thynge to ye chirche.
But rather to be redy to take fro it / yt was
gyuen before and I thynke it wyll not be longe
or this beſene. ¶Thus this freer Iohn̄ of
Roche tayllayd whome the cardynalles helde

put hym to dethe yf they myght haue founde

fynde none / & ſo ſuffred hym to lyue / but they
durſt not let hym out of pryſon / for he ſhewed
his matters ſo parfyte / and layde for hym hyghe
ſcryptures / that peraduenture he myght
haue made many in the worlde to haue arred / 
Howbeit ſuche as toke more hede to his ſayenge
then I dyde ſawe many thynges fall after
accordynge as he ſayd and wrote in pryſon / &
all yt he ſayd he wolde proue by the apocalyps
the true prowes wherwith he armed hymſelfe
who ſaued hym fro brennynge / and alſo ſome
of the Cardynalles had pyte on hym and wolde
not do theyr vttermooſt to hym.

to kynge Don Peter & to kynge Iohn̄ of Caſtell
and to his wyfe the lady Beatryce & yet
thoughe ſome helde the opynyon of that lady / 
neuertheleſſe other named her a baſtarde for
ſhe was doughter to a lady in Portyngale called
Elynoure / who had as then her fyrſt huſbande
on lyue a knyght of yt countre ſyr Iohn̄
Laurence of Coygne / and ye kynge of Portyngale
had taken her fro hym / and the kynge maryed
her and put her huſbande out of Portyngale
who wente and dwelled with the kynge
of Caſtell for he durſt not dwell in Portyngale
for fere of the kynge who helde his wyſe / &
yet he was of hyghe lygnage. Theſe thynges
are to be meruaylled at. For kynge Ferant of
Portyngale reputed his doughter as lawfully
begotten for he had a dyſpenſacyon of pope
Vrban the .vi. And then ye peas was made bytwene
the .ii. kynges of Caſtell & Portyngale
& that a knyght of the royalme of Portyngale
called ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant Andere who was chefe
of counſayle with the kynge of Portyngale
treated of peas and made ye mariage bytwene
kynge Ferant of Portyngalles doughter and
kynge Iohn̄ of Caſtell who was as thē a wyddower / 
and had maryed before ye doughter of
Don Peter kynge of Aragon / thoughe ye kynge
of Caſtell & his counſayle dyd caſt all theſe
doubtes / and howe they fered leſt the kynge of
Portingales doughter ſholde not be taken as
heyre of Portyngale after her faders dyſſeas
but to put in ſuretye therof ye kynge of Caſtell
the kynge of Portyngale cauſed dyuers of the
chefe lordes of Portyngale to ſwere that after
the kynges dyſſeas to take her as theyr lady / &
to tourne the royalme of Portyngale to ye kynge
of Caſtel. Alſo ye kynge of Portyngale had
bounde certayne good townes to the kynge of
Caſtel to take hym as theyr kynge on ye payne
of forfayture of .ii. thouſande frankes / & thoughe
this knyght Iohan Ferant Andere dyde
his buſynes for a good entente to make peas &
concorde bytwene Caſtell and Portyngale at
ye inſtaunce of his lorde / yet ye comons of Lyrbone
ſlewe hym / and chaſe to theyr kynge this
mayſter Deuyce / for they ſayd they wolde not
be vnder the ſubiectyon of them of Caſtell / 
they hated them ſo moche / for they coulde neuer
loue togyder / & alſo they ſayd yt the crowne
of Portyngale myght not go to a woman / 
and that the quene of Caſtell was not true herytour
but a baſtarde & worſe then a baſtarde
for kynge Ferantes lyuynges / and after his
dethe Iohan Ferant of Coygne lyued / who
was huſbande to that ladyes moder / and therfore
they chaſe this mayſter Denyce and was
crowned by theſe .iiii. Cytees Lyrbone / Vyc / 
Eure / and the porte of Portyngale / they ſayd
they wolde haue a kynge amonge them / & one
of the chefe incydentes that moued ye comons
to be agaynſt the kynge of Caſtell was as I
ſhall ſhewe you. The Spanyardes whom I
call Caſtellyans when the maryage was made
bytwene them and Portyngale / and that ye
kynge of Portyngale had graunted that after
his dyſſeas the royalme ſholde go to the kyng
of Caſtell / euer when the Spanyardes mette

ony of the Portyngales they wolde mocke thē
and ſay / ſyrs whether ye wyll or not nowe ye
ſhall come to our daunger / we ſhall holde you
vnder ſubiectyon and ſeruage / and kepe you
lyke ſlaues and Iues / and do with you as we
lyſt / & they wolde anſwere & ſaye they truſted
that ſholde neuer be / & neuer to be vnder ſubiectyon
of ony other man lyuyng excepte god / 
and for ſuche cauſes and wordes reprouable
of the Spanyardes / ye Portyngales toke this
mayſter Denyce baſterde broder to kynge Ferant
& made hym kynge / in his broders dayes
there was no rekenynge made of hym / nor the
kynge / that the comons wolde neuer haue choſen
hym to theyr kynge / and forſake his doughter
as they dyd. Howbeit often tymes this
ſayd knyght ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant Andere ſayd to
the kynge / how that this mayſter Denyce his
baſterde broder had gretely the grace of the comons
of the royalme / wherfore he ſayd it had
ben good he had ben put to dethe / but kynge
Ferant anſwered and ſayd howe the comons
ſholde neuer haue puyſſaūce to do ony thynge
agaynſt the wyll of the noble men of his countrey / 
and how that his ſone in lawe the kynge
of Caſtell ſholde euer be puyſſaunt ynough to
conſtrayne them / and to chaſtyce them yf they
rebelled after his dyſſeaſe / Wherfore he ſayd
there was noo cauſe to put his baſtarde broder
to deth nor put hym in pryſon / ſayng how
he was his broder and a man of relygyon and
had ynoughe to lyue on beſyde the crowne of
Portyngale / and ſo he was lefte alyue.
            THeſe foreſayd poyntes and artycles be
true / for I the auctoure of this booke
haue ben ſufficyently enfourmed therof by the
nobles of Portyngale / it is a thynge to be meruayled
at / to make a baſtarde a kynge / & they
of Portyngale ſaye / and as yet ſayth / that the
quene of Caſtel the lady B
                  •
               autryce / doughter
to ye lady Elynour of Coygne was a baſtarde
therfore they wolde not take her as quene of
Portyngale / nor none heyre that came of her / 
the ſame opynyon the erle of Foys layde to ye
knyghtes of his countrey when they wente in
to Spayne to ayde the kynge of Caſtel / for he
had ben ſuffycyently infourmed in the matter
bytwene Portyngale and Caſtel / wherfore he
ſayd to thē at theyr departyng. Syrs ye haue
nothynge to do to buſy yourſelfe bytwene Caſtell
and Portyngale / for the quene of Caſtell
who was doughter to kynge Ferant of Portyngale / 
it is a warre euyll begon / there maye
moche euyl come to them that be buſye in that
matter / but they anſwered hym ſyth they had
receyued wages of ſuche a man as the kynge
of Caſtell was / they muſt nedes go and ſerue
hym / and ſo they wente / & mooſt parte of them
there dyed / as ye haue herde here before.
            NOwe let vs retourne to the buſynes of
Portyngale. For they be not for to be
lefte for the grete aduentures that there hathe
fallē. And to cronycle al thynges as they haue
fallen / to the entente that in tyme to come they
ſholde be founde / wryten / and regyſtred / yf aduentures
were not knowen it were grete domage.
And by clerkes yt auncyently haue wryten
and regyſtred the hyſtoryes and bookes / 
therby ye hyſtories are knowen / there is not ſo
perpetuall a memory as is wrytynge / & truely
I ſaye to you & wyll that they that come after
me ſholde knowe / that for to knowe the trouth
of this hyſtory I haue taken therin grete payne
in my dayes / and haue ſerched many royalmes
and countreys to knowe the trouthe / and
haue had acquayntaūce of many valyaunt mē
and haue ſene dyuers bothe of Fraunce / of Englonde / 
of Scotlande / Caſtell / Portyngale / &
of other landes / Duchyes / and Countyes / ſuche
as they and theyr landes hath ben conioyned
in theſe warres / & with them I haue ſpoken
and ben inſtructed and infourmed / and I
wolde not that ony enqueſt ſholde paſſe vnknowen / 
ſyth I knewe it to be true and notable.
And whyle I was in Byerne with ye erle
Gaſton of Foys / I was there enfourmed of
dyuers buſyneſſes / ſuche as fell bytwene Caſtell
and Portyngale / and when I was retourned
agayne in to my countrey in the countye
of Heynalte / and in the towne of Valencennes / 
and that I had refreſſhed me there a
ſeaſon / then I determyned me to folowe the hyſtory
yt I had begon / then I aduyſed in myne
ymagynacyon / howe I coulde not ſuffycyently
be inſtructed by the herynge of them that ſuſteyned
the opynyon of the kynge of Caſtell / 
but that in lykewyſe I ought to here the Portyngales
as well as the Gaſcoynes and Spanyardes
that I herde in the houſe of the erle of
Foys / and in the waye goynge thyder and retournynge / 
I toke noo regarde to the payne
or trauayle of my body / but ſo I wente to Bruges
in Flaundres to fynde there ſome of yt royalme
of Portyngale and of Lyxbone / for there
were euer ſome of y• countrey / beholde if myne
aduenture were good or no yf I had ſought a

ſeaſon .vii. yere I coulde not haue come to a
better poynte then I dyd then / for then it was
ſhewed me that if I wolde go to Meldeboure
in Selande I ſholde fynde there a knyght of
Portyngale / a valyaunt man and a ſage / and
of the kynge of Portyngales counſayle / who
was newly come thyder / & was goynge thens
by ſee in to Pruce / & howe he coulde iuſtly and
playnly ſhewe me of the buſynes and aduentures
of Portyngale / for he knewe & had ben
ouer all the countrey. Theſe tydynges reioyſynge
me and ſo I wente fro Bruges with one
of Portyngale in my company / who knewe ryght
wel this knyght / and ſo we came to Sluſe
and there toke the ſee / and dyd ſo moche by the
grace of god that we came to meldeboure / and
the Portyngales that were in my company aquaynted
me with this knyght / and I founde
hym ryght gracyous / ſage / honourable / courtoys
/ amyable / and acquayntable / & ſo I was
with hym .vi. dayes or there aboute. And this
knyght enfourmed me of all ye buſynes bytwene
the royalme of Caſtel and Portyngale ſyth
the dethe of kynge Ferant tyll the departynge
of that knyght out of that countrey / he ſhewed
me euery thynge ſo playnly and ſo gracyouſly
that I toke grete pleaſure to here hym / and to
wryte it. And when I was enfourmed by hym
of all that I deſyred to knowe / I toke leue of
hym / and he conueyed me to my ſhyp / & ſo dyd
dyuers other ryche merchauntes of his countrey / 
who were come fro Bruges / & fro other
places to ſe hym / & in his company there was
the ſone of Nauarre in Portyngale / & dyuers
other knyghtes and ſquyers of that royalme / 
but he had the chefe honoure amonge them / &
certaynly by that I coulde ſe and ymagyne of
hym and of his eſtate he was worthy to haue
honour / for he was of noble porte / and goodly
ſtature / and lykely to be a valyaunt man. And
whē I retourne agayne fro Rome in to myne
owne countrey I ſhall buſy me to make relacyon
of the wordes of this gentyll knyght called
ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant Porteler / and ſhall cronycle

            ¶Howe they of Portyngale ſent out
meſſageres in to Englonde to ſhewe
tydynges of theyr coūtrey to the kynge
of Englonde and to the grete lordes
there. Ca. xliii.
            
               HOwe ſheweth the hyſtory
yt after this mayſter
Denys kyng Iohn̄ of Portyngale
had dyſcomfyted
kynge Iohn̄ of Caſtell at yt
batayle of Iuberoth nere to
ye abbaye called ye Cabbaſe
where as ſo many noble knyghtes & ſquyers
of Fraunce / Gaſcoyne / and Byerne were ſlayne / 
and that the kynge of Portyngale for that
fayre & vyctoryous iourney was gretely doubted
and honoured of the Portyngales / & was
receyued after his vyctory in to Lyxbone with
grete glory of al the people / & there with grete
tryumphe was crowned with lawrell / as auncyently
kynges were wonte to be crowned / after
they had dyſcomfyted ony kyng in batayle
and there in Lyxbone was grete feeſt or the departure
of ſuche knyghtes and ſquyers as were
there / and the counſayles of the good townes
and cytees of yt royalme. Then there was
a parlyament and a counſayle holden / howe
they might perceyuer in theyr opinyon on honourably / 
for certayne of the ſages of the royalme
ſayd howe it was neceſſary for them to ſe how
they myght fortefye themſelfe agaynſt ye kyng
of Caſtel & his puyſſaunce / ſo yt they myght honourably
abyde in theyr victory / & multiply
& exalte in this parlyament at Lyxbone holdē
in the cathedrall chyrche of ſaynt Dominicke.
There were many deuyſes recyted whiche nede
not to be reherſed / but the reſt and concluſyon
of this parlyament was that they ſholde
ſende in to Englonde to the duke of Lancaſtre
who claymed of ryght the enherytaūce of Caſtell / 
by reaſon of yt lady Conſtaunce his wyfe
eldeſt doughter to kynge Don Peter of Caſtell / 
and to wryte to hym that if euer he wolde
clayme ony ryght in the royalme of Caſtell / &
to ſet forwarde his buſynes / whiche longe hath
hanged in balaunce / and in aduenture to be
loſt / yt wolde come in to Portyngale with a
company of men of armes and archers / for as
then it was tyme conuenyent for hym ſo to do
Then the erle of Nauarre conſtable of Portyngale
in fayre language ſayd. Syth we be
agreed to ſende in to Englonde to the duke of
Lancaſtre by whome we thynke to be ayded / 
whiche is the mooſt profytableſt waye for vs / 
to cauſe our enemyes to feare vs / therfore let
vs aduyſe in our royalme ſage perſonages &
notable to do this meſſage / & to enfourme ſo ye
duke of Lancaſtre and his counſayle to come
in to this countrey ſo ſtronge as to reſyſt our

enemyes with ſuche ayde as he ſhall haue of
vs / for we may well ſuppoſe that the kynge of
Caſtell wyll gete grete ayde of the Frenſſhe
kynge. The Frenſſhe men of warre wote not
where better to enploy theyr ſeaſon / for they
haue peas wt Englonde vnto the feeſt of ſaynt
Iohn̄. And alſo the Frenſſhe men haue ferme
peas with yt Flemynges / who hath occupyed
them before dyuers yeres. The erle of Nauerres
wordes were well accepted / and euery mā
ſayd howe he ſpake well to the poynte / and yt
ſo they wolde do. Then there were named by
ſad dely beracyon of counſayle that the grete
mayſter of ſaynt Iaques in Portyngale and
Laurence Fongaſſe a ryght ſage and dyſcrete
ſquyer who coulde ryght well ſpeke ye language
of Fraunce / howe they ſholde goo on this
meſſage in to Englonde / for they coulde ſende
none of the counſayle of Portyngale that better
coulde doo that meſſage then they. Then
there were letters wryten in good Frenſſhe &
in Latyn to the kynge of Englonde / to yt duke
of Lancaſtre / & to his bretherne ye erle of Cambrydge
and Bokyngham. And when theſe letters
were wryten and groſed vp in Frenſſhe &
in Latyn / then they were redde before yt kyng
& his counſayle there / & well lyked / & ſo ſealed
& delyuered to the grete mayſter of ſaynt Iaques / 
& to Laurence Fongaſe / who toke on thē
ye charge to bere them in to Englonde / ſo they
myght paſſe the daungere of the ſee / & encoūteryng
of ony enemyes & robbers of ye ſee / for as
wel there were robbers on ye ſee as on ye lande
So they toke a ſhyp called ye Lyn whiche wolde
ſayle with all maner of wyndes more ſurelyer
then ony other ſhyp. So on a day they toke
theyr leue of the kyng & of the archebyſſhop
of Connymbres / and of the grete counſayle of
Portyngale / and wente to the ſee / and ſayled
towarde Englonde / and were .iii. dayes on ye
ſee without ſyght of lande / and on the fourthe
day they ſawe Cornewall.
            THey ſped ſo well by theyr iourneys / &
by the ayde of god and good wynde yt
they coſted Cornewell and yt boundes of Englonde / 
and ſo aryued ſaufely without peryll
in the hauen of Hampton / and there caſt ancre
and ſo yſſued out of theyr ſhyppe / and wente
& refreſſhed them in yt towne / & there they were
examyned by the baylyffe of Hampton & ſuche
other as were kepers of y• coſt of what coū
               trey
they were / & fro whens they came / & whyther
they wolde / they anſwered to all theyr demaundes / 
& ſayd howe they were of the royalme
of Portyngale / and ſente thyder fro theyr
kynge and his counſayle / then they were welcome
and had good chere / and when they had
refreſſhed them there and prouyded for horſes
for them / and for theyr ſeruauntes. Then they
rode to London by guydes / for they knew not
the countrey / and ſo were lodged at the ſygne
of the Fawcon / and ſente backe agayne theyr
horſes / and it fortuned ſo well for them that ye
kynge and his vncles were at Weſtmynſtre / 
wherof they were ioyfull / they came to Londō
in the fore noone / & ſo dyned / and after dyner
they toke theyr letters & wente to the duke of
Lancaſtre & to the duches. And when yt duke &
the duches knewe of theyr comynge they were
ryght ioyfull / for they deſyred to here tydynges
fro Portyngale / there had ben ſhewed thē
dyuers tydynges / but gretely they dyd nor byleue
it / bycauſe they had no letters therof out
of y• countrey. Then ye grete mayſter of ſaynt
Iaques & Laurence Fongaſe entred in to the
dukes chambre / and the duches there preſent / 
and becauſe yt Laurence Fongaſe coulde ſpeke
frenſſhe he ſpake fyrſt / & when he had made
his reuerence to the duke and to the duches / &
delyuered them letters fro Portyngale / ye duke
toke his / & the duches hers / and ſo red theyr
letters / & then the duke ſayd to the meſſageres
Syrs ye be ryght welcome into this coutrey
and to morowe ye ſhall go to the kynge / & we
ſhall do you the ayde we can / as it is reaſon.
Then the duches drewe Laurence Fongaſe a
parte & demaūded of hym tydynges out of Caſtell
& Portyngale / to euery thynge this Laurence
anſwered. Then yt duke called for wyne
and ſpyce / & ſo they dranke / & toke theyr leue &
retourned to theyr lodgynge / & in ye mornyng
they wente agayne to ye duke / who had herde
maſſe / and ſo then they entred in to a barge &
wente by water to Weſtmynſtre / where ye kynge
and the mooſt parte of his counſayle was.
The duke entred in to the counſayle chambre
& ſayd to the kynge. Syr here is ye grete mayſter
of ſaynt Iaques in Portyngale who hath
brought you letters fro ye kynge / wyl it pleaſe
you to ſe them / with a good wyll ſayd ye kynge
Then the .ii. meſſagers kneled downe before
the kynge / & Laurence Fongaſe delyuered his
letters / the kynge toke them / and cauſed them
to be redde / alſo they delyuered letters to the
erle of Cambrydge / & to the erle of Bokynghā
eche of them redde theyr letters. The kyng anſwered
ye meſſageres ryght ſwetely and ſayd.
            
               
¶Syrs ye are welcome in to this countrey / 
your comynge dothe vs grete ioy / and ye ſhal
not departe without anſwere ſuche as ſhall
pleaſe you and all your buſynes / let myne vncles
here haue them in remembraunce / ſo they
thanked the kynge and departed out of y• counſayle
chambre / and wente downe in to the palays
abydynge for the duke of Lancaſtre who
taryed tyll it was hyghe noone. Then the duke
of Lancaſtre toke his two bretherne with
hym to dyner / and wente by water / and theſe
meſſageres with thē. The erle of Cambrydge
knewe ryght well the grete mayſter of ſaynt
Iames and Laurence of Fougaſe / for he had
ſene them before in Portyngale / wherfore after
dyner he comoned with thē of dyuers thynges
in the preſence of his other two bretherne
and demaunded them of the maryage of Caſtell / 
and of her that ſholde haue ben his doughter
in lawe the lady Beautyce. To all his
demaundes the ambaſſadours anſwered wyſely
and truely / wherby the lordes were ryght
well contente and pleaſed.
            TRewe it was that before theſe ambaſſadours
were comen into Englonde the
duke of Lancaſtre / and the erle of Cambrydge
his broder had dyuers counſayles togyder for
the ryght they claymed by theyr wyſtes. The
Erle of Cambrydge as ye haue herde before / 
was not well contente with kynge Ferant of
Portyngale nor with the men of warre there / 
for they had lodged .xv. dayes in the feldes before
ye Caſtellyans / and yet kynge Ferant nor
the Portyngales wolde neuer fyght with thē
yet the erle the ſame tyme ſhewed ye kynge his
defaulte & ſayd / ſyr I haue here in my company
of poore Englyſſhe mē a .C. ſperes & a .M.
archers. And al we are wyllyng to fyght with
our enemyes / and to abyde the aduenture that
god wyll ſende vs / but kynge Ferant anſwered
euer that he was not counſayled to fyght / 
wherfore when the Erle ſaw that he departed
thens / and toke with hym agayne his ſone out
of Portyngale / and when he was departed / 
then the kynge of Portyngale accorded with
kynge Iohn̄ of Caſtell / & maryed his doughter
to hym to make the peas / and this treatye
was made by ſyr Iohn̄ Audre a knyght of portyngale.
The kynge there had all his truſt in
hym. The kynge of Portyngale demaunded
of his doughter whether ſhe had rather haue
the kynge of Caſtel / or the erle of Cambrydge
ſone. She anſwered and ſayd howe ſhe loued
better Iohn̄ of Englonde then Iohn̄ of Caſtel
The kynge demaunded why ſhe ſayd ſoo / ſhe
anſwered / bycauſe Iohn̄ of Englonde was a
goodly perſonage and of her age / & that was
the cauſe ſhe wolde not haue the kynge of Caſtell / 
howbeit her fader to haue peas with the
Spanyardes made that maryage. Alſo the
erle had ſayd to the duke of Lancaſtre his broder
that kynge Ferant ones deed / he doubted
that the comons of the royalme of Portyngale
wolde rebell agaynſt the lady Beautryce / for
the mooſt parte of the royalme (For al yt theyr
kynge had maryed her moder the lady Elyanoure
of Coygne.) yet they helde not the kynges
doughter to be borne in lawfull maryage
but reputed her as a baſtarde / and mermured
theron whyle the erle was there. Wherfore he
was the gladder to take away his ſone thens.
The duke of Lancaſtre to whom y• matter touched
nerer then to the erle of Cambrydge bycauſe
he had maryed the eldeſt ſyſter heyre to
Caſtell / and he had a fayre chylde by the lady
Conſtaunce his wyfe / wherfore he euer deſyred
to be truely and iuſtly enfourmed of yt buſynes
in thoſe partyes / and dyd ſet his mynde
howe he myght exalte and further his tytle / &
he ſawe clerely that as then he coulde not haue
ſo good an entre in to Caſtell as by the royalme
of Portyngale / ſpecyally ſeynge howe he
was deſyred and requyred of the kyng of Portyngale / 
and of the barons and comons of the
royalme / & alſo conſyderynge howe the kynge
of Portyngale that was then was a noble ſage
prynce and valyaunt / ſeynge howe he had
dyſcomfyted the kynge of Caſtel in playne batayle
and all his puyſſaunce / Wherby the duke
ye ſoner enclyned to go in to Portyngale.
And alſo the kynge of Englonde and his counſayle
was agreed therto / but to the entente to
be iuſtly enfourmed of all the buſynes / ſtate / 
and condycyon of the countrey of Caſtell / and
of the ryght that the lady Beautryce claymed
to the crowne of Portyngale / and alſo of the
ryght of kynge Iohn̄ of Portyngale whome
the comons had crowned to theyr kynge. For
this entente on a daye the duke made a dyner
to theſe ambaſſadours of Portyngale in his
owne lodging / and after dyner he made euery
man to departe / & called theſe ambaſſadours
to hym ryght amorouſly / and demaunded of
them of the buſynes of Portyngale / and bycauſe
that Laurence Fougaſe coulde ſpeke / 
Frenſſhe the duke addreſſed his wordes vnto

hym & ſayd. Laurence I requyre you to ſhew
me from poynte to poynte the conducyon and
maner of your londe of Portyngale / & what
hath fallen there / and in Caſtell ſyth my broder
the erle of Cambrydge was there / for the
kynge of Portyngale hath wryten to me that
there is no man in Portyngale yt can enforme
me more iuſtly then ye can do / and in this ye
ſhall do me a grete pleaſure / ſyr ſayd y• ſquyer
I ſhall fulfyll your pleaſure / and then began
to ſpeke and ſayd in this maner.
            Syrſyth the departure of your broder the
erle of Cambrydge out of Portyngale
there hath fallen grete trouble and dyſcencyō
in the royalme / and in grete aduenture to haue
ben loſt / but thanked be god the buſyneſſes
there / are as nowe in good poynte and fermely
ſtablyſſhed / but and god had not wrought
by his grace the matter had gone euyll / and
all thrughe the defaulte of kynge Ferrant laſt
dyſſeaſed. This is the oppynyon of the mooſt
parte of the royalme / for kynge Ferrant in his
dayes loued ſore a lady wyfe to a knyght of
his called ſyr Iohn̄ Laurence of Coygne / and
bycauſe of her beautye he wolde haue her by
force. The lady withſtode the kynges deſyre
as longe as ſhe myght / but at the laſte he had
her and ſayd. Dame I ſhall make you quene
of Portyngale / for thoughe I loue you / it is
not for your hurte / but to exalte you / for I wyl
mary you. Then the lady on her knees wepynge
ſayd / ſyr ſauynge your dyſpleaſure. I can
haue none honour to be quene of Portyngale
for you knowe and ſo doth all the worlde that
I haue an huſbande all redy / and haue hadde
this .v. yere / Elyanoure ſayd the kynge make
none eſcuſe / for I wyll haue none other wyfe
but you / but I ſhall quyte you from your huſbande
or I mary you. The lady coulde gete
none other wordes of the kynge / and ſhe ſhewed
all the matter to her huſbande / and when yt
knyght knewe therof / he was ſory and maleneolyous / 
and regarded and ſtudyed what were
beſt for hym to do / and ſayd to hymſelfe / I
wyll not thus leue my wyfe / howbeit he doubted
the kynge / and wente out of the royalme
of Portyngale / into Caſtell to kynge Henry
who receyued hym / and reteyned hym to be of
his houſe as longe as he lyued / and ſoo dothe
kynge Iohn̄ that nowe is. Thus the kynge
of Portyngale to accomplyſſhe his folyſſhe
pleaſure / ſente for the knyght and for the lady
but the knyght was goone. Then the kynge
ſente for the byſſhophe of Connymbres / who
was as then chauncelloure of Portyngale / 
and of the kynges counſayle / and the kynge
ſhewed hym his entent / how he wolde wedde
Elyanoure of Coygne / and the byſſhop fered
the kynge bycauſe he knewe hym of an hyghe
and a fyerce condycyon / therfore he durſt not
ſaye contrary to the kynges pleaſure / and alſo
ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant Audere / who was chefe of
counſayle with the kynge to pleaſe the kynge
ayd to ye byſſhop. Syr ye may wed them wel
ynoughe / ones ye kynge ſhal make recompence
for all / ſo ye byſſhop wedded them / & this lady
was crowned quene / & ſo reputed in al ye grete
Cytees in Portyngale / and had as moche honoure
and reuerence as euer hadde ony other
quene in the royalme of Portyngale / and the
kynge had by her a doughter / who as nowe is
quene of Caſtell. True it was that whyle kynge
Ferant lyued / he ſente on a day / to Lyxbone
for all the prelates and noble men of the countrey / 
and for the counſayles of the Cytees / portes / 
and townes of Portyngale / and this was
or your broder the erle of Cambrydge came in
to Portyngale / and there the kynge made euery
man to ſwere and to promyſe that after his
dyſſeaſe they ſholde take his doughter the lady
Beautryce / Who was as then but fyue yeres
of aege / for herytoure of ye royalme of Portyngale
euery man ſware whether they wolde
or not. Howbeit the mooſt parte of them yt
were there knewe ryght well that ſhe was but
a baſtarde / and borne in aduoutrye / for her moders
huſbande was ſtyll lyuynge / called ſyr
Iohn̄ Laurence of Coygne / who lyued in Caſtell
with the kynge there as longe as kynge
Ferant of Portyngale lyued / and lenger / how
bert ſyr I thynke ſurely yf the kynges doughter
had ben a ſone / that all the comonaltye of
Portyngale wolde ſoner haue agreed to hym
thē to his doughter. For to her they ſayd they
wolde neuer agree / but had rather dye then to
be vnder the ſubiectyon of the royalme of Caſtell.
¶For as yet the royalme of Portyngale
and the royalme of Caſtell neuer loued parfytely
togyder / But hathe often tymes haryed / 
and made warre eche with other / In lykewyſe
as the royalme of Scotlande dothe with yt
royalme of Englonde.
            THen the duke of Lancaſtre demaunded
of Laurence Fongaſe / where kynge

Iohn̄ that nowe is broder to kynge Ferrant
was in kynge Ferrantes dayes. Syr ſayd the
ſquyer he was in the royalme of Portyngale
in a houſe of relygyon wherin be knyghtes of
an ordre in whyte habytes with a reed croſſe
and he was ſouerayne of that houſe / and was
called mayſter Deuyce. The kynge ſet lytell
by his broder but made hym ruler of that houſe
of Denyce / nor alſo kynge Iohn̄ that nowe
is / medled nothynge with the buſynes of the
royalme / nor thought nothyng of the crowne
therof. For yf kynge Ferrant of Portyngale
had thought ony thynge of that is fallen ſyth
he loued his lady Elyanoure & the lady Beautryce
her doughter / he wolde haue ſlayne his
broder who is nowe kynge / but bycauſe he ſawe
that he kepte his houſe with the bretherne
of his ordre ſo mekely and duely he had no ſuſpecte
in hym / but ſo let hym lyue in peas. And
ſyr as for the dyſſencyon that is nowe bytwe-Portyngale
and Caſtell / ſurely ſyr to ſaye the
trouthe therin / ye Spanyardes are cauſe ther
of / Why ſo ſayd ye duke / I ſhall ſhewe you ſayd
the ſquyer. The Caſtellyans when they ſawe
that kynge Ferrant had maryed his doughter
to theyr kynge / then they began to be prowde / 
and began to ſpeke grete wordes / whiche
ſore greueo the Portyngales / for the Spanyardes
wolde ſay. Oye Portyngales rude people
lyke beeſtes / The tyme nowe is come that
we ſhall haue a good market of you / for ye haue
ben and ſhall be ours / we ſhall deuyde and
ſet you in companyes as we do the Iues who
dwelleth by truage vnder vs / ye ſhall be our
ſubiectes with other venymous wordes / often
tymes they ſayd thus when they met the Portyngales.
And whyle kynge Ferrant lyued / &
had maryed his doughter in to Caſtell / they
engendred ſuche an hate that they murmured
and ſayd / it were better to be deed thē to be vnder
the daunger and ſubieccyon of ye Caſtellyans / 
and ſo kynge Ferrant fell ſyke whiche endured
a hole yere. And when he was deed and
buryed in the chyrche of ſaynt Fraunce a relygyous
houſe of freers in the cyte of Lyxbone
Then the cytees / good townes / and caſtelles
in Portyngale cloſed theyr gates / & they ſente
for the kynge that nowe is to Lyxbone / who
knewe ryght well the ententes of the .iii. other
cytees / as Connymbres / Porte / and Eure.
Then they ſayd. Mayſter Deuyce (ſo he was
called as then) We wyll make you kynge of
this royalme thoughe ye be a baſtarde / but we
ſay that your coſyn the lady Beautryce quene
of Caſtell is borne rather a baſterde than you
for as yet lyueth her moders fyrſt huſbande. /
And ſyth it is ſo that the crowne of Portyngale
is fallen in two wayes / we wyll take for vs
the mooſt profytable / and alſo the mooſt parte
of the royalme enclyneth to make you our kynge / 
and that the crowne of Portyngale ſhall
not go to a woman / nor we wyll not be vnder
the ſubieccyon of the kynge of Caſtell / nor of
the Caſtellyans / we had rather ye ſholde take
all that we haue / to ayde and to maynteyne vs
and our fraunches / thē the Caſtellyans ſholde
be mayſters ouer vs / wherfore ſyr receyue our
gyfte / for we wyl it ſhal be thus / then this mayſter
Denyce who is as nowe kynge wolde not
receyue theyr offre at the fyrſt nor ſeconde requeſt
but anſwered and ſayd. Good people I
knowe well of good affeccyon and entyer loue
ye offre me the crowne of Portyngale / whiche
is a grete thynge / and where as ye ſaye that I
haue as grete ryght or more to the crowne as
my co
                  •
               yn the quene of Caſtell. In lykewyſe I
thynke the ſame / for true it is ſhe is a baſterde
for as yet lyueth her moders huſbande and is
in Caſtel / but there is one poynte / ye all alone
can not do this matter / it behoueth that al the
nobles or grete parte of them agre therto / thē
they of Lyxbone anſwered and ſayd / ſyr we haue
ynowe / We knowe all redy the courage of
dyuers / and alſo the oppynyon of them of the
.iii. chefe cytees of this royalme beſyde vs / as
Connymbres / Porte / and Eure / then the kyng
ſayd / let it be as ye wyl I am content / ye know
well that this lady Elyanoure who is called
quene of this royalme is as yet here in this cyte / 
and her counſaylloure with her ſyr Iohn̄
Ferrant Audere who wyll kepe the crowne of
Portyngale and the herytage therof for ye quene
of Caſtell / for he made fyrſt the maryage to
make peas bytwene Caſtell and Portyngale
& peraduenture the kynge of Caſtell wyll ſende
for hym haſtely to helpe to ſubdue his rebelles.
Wherfore nowe at the obſequye of my broder
whiche ſhal be ſhortely / wherat moſt parte
of the nobles of this royalme and Cytees wyl
be / it were good to prouyde for remedy in that
behalfe / then they that were preſente ſayd / ſyr
that ye ſaye is true we ſhall prouyde therfore / 
as we ſhall here ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant ſpeke / and
ſo as then theyr counſayle ended.
            
               
IT was not longe after but that the obſequye
was kepte at Lyxbone in the freers
where as kynge Ferrant lyeth / and there were
many of the nobles of Portyngale / for they were
deſyred ſo to be by ye quene and by ſyr Iohn̄
Ferrant Audere who gouerned the quene / &
there was the kynge that nowe is with a grete
nombre of the comons of the countrey / and ſpecyally
of the thre cytees Connymbres / Eure / 
and ye porte of Portyngale / for they all agreed
and conſented to them of Lyxbone. And when
the obyte was done ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere
deſyred in the quenes name the nobles that were
there preſente that they ſholde not departe
thens that daye nor the nexte / ſaynge howe the
quene wolde haue theyr counſayles what ſholde
be done to ſende in to Caſtel for kyng Iohn̄
and his wyfe the lady Beautryce theyr lady / 
who was herytoure by ryght to the royalme
of Portyngale / all the nobles or a grete parte
of them that herde his wordes made lytel ther
of / for they doubted ſore the comons that were
there eſſembled / for they had herde dyuers of
them murmure ſaynge how they wolde crowne
to be theyr kynge mayſter Denyce. Alſo ſyr
Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere had herde lyke wordes
Therfore he deſyred the nobles of the royalme
to abyde there with hym to ayde and ſuſteyne
his opynyon / but they fayled hym / for as ſone
as the kynges obyte was done in the foreſayd
freers / and yt quene Elyanour was retourned
to her lodgyng / then euery man cryed to horſe
and ſo al or the mooſt parte mounted on theyr
horſes / & ſo departed fro Lyxbone / ſome taryed
ftyll ſuche as were on the kynges partye yt
nowe is / and they wente to theyr lodgynges / 
and kepte themſelfe pryuely and dyſſymuled
the matter / for they well ymagyned the matter
to fall as it fell / as I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
when the kynges obyte was done the comons
of Lyxbone and of the other thre cytees ſuche
as were there retourned not ſhortely to theyr
lodgynges but wente to the cathedral chyrche
of Lyxbone called ſaynt Domynycke / and there
they aſſembled and mayſter Denyce with
them / there they had grete counſayle togyder
Whiche counſayle endured not longe. For the
kynge that nowe is ſayd vnto them. ¶All ye
good people I vnderſtande ye wolde make
me your kynge. And ſurely I ſaye it is my ryght.
And yf ye wyll perceyuer in that purpoſe
it is tyme to ſette a worke / and to ſhewe your
dede and 
                  •
               uyſſaunce / for ye knowe ryght well
that ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere dothe procure
the nobles of the royalme to ſende for ye kynge
of Caſtell / and he ſayth and maynteyneth that
the crowne of Portyngale perteyneth to the
kynge of Caſtel by the ryght of my coſyne his
wyfe / and I ſaye yf ye wyll ayde me it is my
ryght rather then hers / ye knowe all the maner / 
for I am a man / & broder to kynge Ferrāt
and ſone to good kynge Peter of Portyngale
who gouerned you valyauntly. True it is my
coſyne the quene of Caſtell was doughter to
kynge Ferrant / but that was not by lawfull
maryage. Then they of Lyxbone ſayd vnto
hym. Syr all this is true / we wyll haue none
other kynge but you / and we wyll make you
our kynge / loke theron who wyll / but ye ſhall
ſwere vnto vs that ye ſhall be good to vs and
kepe Iuſtyce / and ye ſhall not flatter no more
with the grete lordes then with the ſmall people / 
and ye ſhall kepe and ſuſteyne with good
herte with the ayde that we ſhall gyue you / all
the ryght perteynynge to Portyngale. Then
the kynge anſwered and ſayd. Syrs all this
I ſwere / but pryncypally I requyre you to go
with me to ye lodgynge called ye Monnoy where
ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere is with Elyanoure
of Coygne / for I wyll that he be ſlayne
for he hath deſerued it agaynſt me / and agaynſte
you when he ſuſteyneth and maynteyneth
other quarelles agaynſt your wylles / t
                  •
               enne
they all with one voyce anſwered. We wyll
that this be done / for ſurely he is diſobeyſaunt
and a rebell agaynſt you / Wherfore lette hym
be put to dethe / and all the other that be rebellyons
agaynſt you Wherby other of the royalme
ſhall take enſample. Then they departed
togyder from the mynſtre of ſaynt Domynycke
to the nombre of .xv.C. all of one oppynyon / 
and the kynge that nowe is with them / 
and ſoo they wente thrughe the towne to the
lodgynge called the Monnoy where the quene
and ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere were. And
when they came there / they brake vp the gates
of the lodgynge and entred therin perforce
and they wente in to the chambre where as the
quene was / Who was ryght ſore afrayde whē
ſhe ſawe ſo moche people comynge vpon her / 
then incontynent ſhe fell downe on her knees
before this mayſter Denyce / and prayed hym
to haue pyte and compaſſyon vpon her / ſaynge
vnto hym that ſhe knewe nothynge of ony
dyſpleaſure that ſhe hadde done agaynſt hym
or agaynſt ony other. And alſo ſhe ſayd vnto
hym howe that as touchynge the crowne and
herytage of Portyngale ſhe claymed no parte

But mayſter Denyce I requyre you and all
the people here preſent to conſydre how kynge
Ferrant made me quene agaynſt my wyl / then
this mayſter Denyce ſayd. Fayre lady doubte
ye nothynge / for ye ſhall haue no hurte / for we
be not come therfore / but for this traytoure / 
Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere / he ſhall dye to begyn
withall / and then lette the kynge of Caſtell reuenge
his deth yf he can / he hath ben to longe
his proctoure in this countrey / with that worde
auaunced forth ſuche as was ordeyned ther
to / who toke the knyght and put hym to dethe
& more hurte they dyd not to no perſone / but ſo
retourned to theyr lodgynge / and the kynge yt
nowe is wente to his.
            ANd after the dethe of Iohn̄ Ferrant / 
the lady Elyanoure who had ben quene
of Portyngale / toke counſayle and determyned
herſelfe to go out of Portyngale in to
Caſtell to the kynge there / and to the quene
her doughter / for ſhe was in ſuche fray by the
dethe of her knyght ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Audere
that ſhe thought no lenger to abyde in Portyngale / 
for ſhe ſawe ſhe coulde haue there no
ther honoure nor reſt / then ſhe cauſed mayſter
Denyce now kynge to be deſyred to ſuffre her
to departe / and he lyghtly agreed therto / and
ſayd howe that it pleaſed hym well yt ſhe ſholde
peparte / for he ſayd ſhe had good cauſe ſoo
to do. The lady departed fro Lyxbone with
all her company / and ſhe rode ſo longe by her
iourneys that ſhe came to Syuyll where the
kynge of Caſtell and the quene laye / and the
ſame ſeaſon that this lady came thyder / there
were aſſembled nere all the nobles of Caſtell / 
for there they had a grete counſayle on the buſynes
for Portyngale / for kynge Iohn̄ there
toke counſayle howe he myght do / ſcynge the
royalme of Portyngale was fallen to hym by
ſucceſſyon / by the dethe of kynge Ferrant / fader
to the quene his wyfe / Who agreed or he
dyed that it ſholde ſo be / and all the countrey
in lyke wyſe. This lady Elyanoure was receyued
with the kynge and with the quene her
doughter ryght honourably as it was reaſon
Then ſhe was examyned of all the buſynes in
Portyngale / and ſhe ſhewed them the trouthe
of that ſhe hadde ſene and knowen / and alſo
ſhe ſayd howe that it well appered that by all
lykelyhede the comons of Portyngale wolde
crowne to theyr kynge mayſter Denyce / with
out the kynge of Caſtell there agaynſt made
reſyſtence and defence / and for that cauſe they
hadde ſlayne her knyght ſyr Ihon̄ Ferrant of
Audere bycauſe he ſuſteyned / and alwayes he
had done the kynge of Caſtelles quarell / and
in all that this lady ſayd ſhe was wel byleued
for they ſawe it well apparent. And alſo certayne
barons and knyghtes of the royalme
of Portyngale ſuche as hadde better affeccyon
to the kynge of Caſtell / thenne to ſhe kynge
that nowe is / bycauſe of kynge Ferrantes
doughter / and for to accomplyſſhe and fulfyll
theyr othes that they had made to the kynge of
Caſtell / at the deſyre of theyr kynge Iohn̄ Ferrant
when he gaue his doughter in maryage
to the kynge of Caſtell / therfore to acquyte
theyr promyſe they departed out of the royalme
of Portyngale and wente in to Caſtell / 
and lefte theyr owne landes and herytages on
the aduenture to recouer them agayne / as the
erle Alphons Seroll / ye grete pryour of ſaynt
Ihn̄s in Portyngale / ſyr Delagare his broder
Ange Syluaſte of Geneull / Iohn̄ Auſſall
and dyuers other to the nombre of .xxv. Wherby
ye royalme of Portyngale was ſore febled / 
and the royalme of Caſtell enforced. Then the
kynge of Caſtell made his ſomons thrughe
out all his royalme that all noble men / and all
other able to bere armure bytwene .xv. and .xl.
ſholde in all haſt come to hym in to the felde of
Sebyll / for he ſayd he wolde with puyſſaunce
entre in to the royalme of Portyngale / and
conquere it as his owne herytage / at his commaundement
euery man obeyed as it was reaſon / 
for ſuche as helde of hym / and ſo they came
to the felde of Sebyll / and there aſſembled
to the nombre of .lx.M. men of one and other.
            ANd when ſyr Laurence of Coygne huſbande
to the lady Elyanoure whome
kynge Ferrant of Portyngale toke to his wyfe
and was quene of Portyngale vnderſtode
that ſhe was come out of Portyngale in to Caſtell.
Then he wente to certayne of the kynge
of Caſtelles counſayle / and ſayd to them as
in demaundynge of them counſayle. My lordes
and my grete frendes howe ſhall I do wt
Elyamoure my wyfe who is come out of Portyngale
in to this countrey / I knowe ryght
well kynge Ferrant toke her by force agaynſt
her wyll / and nowe kynge Ferrant is deed / 
and ye knowe well by reaſon I ought to haue
my wyfe agayne / what counſayle wyll ye gyue
me therin / and ſuche as he ſpake vnto gaue
hym counſayle and ſayd. Iohn̄ we counſayle

you to make no ſc
                  ••
               blaunt therof / nor demaunde
her not agayne / nor take her not / for if ye do
ye ſhall gretely abate the honoure of the lady
and alſo blemyſſheth the honoure of the quene
of Caſtell her doughter / for then ye ſholde make
her worſe then a baſterde / ye ſe howe ye kyng
of Caſtell wyll demaunde and thynke to conquere
the royalme of Portyngale as his owne
ryghtfull herytage by the ryght of his wyfe.
Thus ye ſhode open clerely whiche is nowe
ſomwhat in doubte and trouble / and without
ye take good hede it wyll coſt you your lyfe yf
ye make ye quene of Caſtel a baſtarde / for they
of this countrey ſuſteyne her quarell / and ſay
that ſhe was borne in iuſt maryage by dyſpenſacyon
of the pope. Well ſayd the knyght / then
what is it beſt for me to do / we ſhall ſhewe you
ſayd they / the beſt that we thynke is yt as ſone
as ye can gete you out of Caſtell and go agayne
to your enherytaunce in to Portyngale / &
leue the lady Elyanoure here with her doughter / 
we ſe none other ſaufegarde for you but
this / by my fayth ſayd ye knyght I byleue you
well for ye counſayle me truely and lyke good
frendes. So this ſyr Iohn̄ Laurence of Coygne
taryed not longe after in Caſtell / but departed
and wente to Lyxbone / & there he founde
mayſter Denyce now kynge and ſayd how
he was come to ſerue hym / and wolde be vnder
his obeyſaunce / for he wolde take hym for
his kynge. Mayſter Denyce had grete ioye &
ſayd howe he was welcome to hym / & ſo gaue
hym agayne all his herytage and made hym
capytayne of Lyxbone. Thus ſyr as I haue
ſhewed you fell the buſynes bytwene Portyngale
and Caſtell.

men of armes to kepe it. And when he hadde
ſoo done / he paſſed the ryuer and wente to the
towne of Valencennes in Portyngale / and
thereto layde his ſyege / and he ſente his meſſagere
vnto them that were whithin / that they
ſholde yelde them and theyr towne vnto hym.

And they of Valence anſwered and ſayd / let
the kynge of Caſtell paſſe forth and go to Lixbone / 
and as ſoone as they myght knowe that
he hath wonne that cyte outher by loue / feare / 
or perforce / that then incontynente they wolde
delyuer vp the keyes of theyr towne to hym
This anſwere pleaſed ryght well the kynge
of Caſtell / and ſo departed fro Valence / In lykewiſe
dyd they of another cyte called Serpe
whiche was ſtronge and fayre / the kyng thought
to haue gone thyder / but when he knewe
theyr compoſycyon / he was content and came
not there / but ſo toke the waye to Lyxbone / for
he knewe yf he myght ſubdue that cyte he ſholde
haue all the reſydue of the countrey at his
caſe / and where ſoeuer he wente he had with
hym the quene his wyfe to ſhewe therby to ye
Portyngales that the ryght was his and that
by good and iuſt cauſe he wolde conquere his

               es herytage.
            THus kyng Iohn̄ of Caſtell came with
all his ooſt before Lyxbone / and there
layde a grete ſyege / & ſhewed wel by his ſyege
that he wolde not departe thens tyll he had ye
cyte at his pleaſure / and gretly thretened mayſter
Denyce / who was within ye cyte and ſayd
howe that yf he myght gete hym / he ſholde dye
an euyll dethe / and all the rebelles with hym.
The kynge of Caſtelles ooſt was grete for he
had moche people / for the Spanyardes and
Frenſſhe men that were there cloſed ſo ye Cyte
aboute that none coulde yſſue out nor entre wt
out he were taken or ſlayne / & ſomtyme it fell
by ſkyrmyſſhes and otherwyſe that the Spanyardes
toke ſome Portyngales / then ye Spanyardes
wolde put out theyr eyen / or ſtryke of
a fote or an arme or ſome other membre / and
ſo ſente them in agayne in to the cyte commaū
               dynge
them to ſaye that they dyd / they dyd in
dyſpyte of ye Lyxbonoys and of theyr mayſter
Denyce whom they wolde make theyr kynge
and alſo ſhewe them playnly that we ſhall holde
this ſyege here ſo longe that we ſhall haue
them perforce / by famyne or otherwyſe / & then
they ſhall all dye an euyll dethe / and ſet fyre on
the cyte without mercy or pyre. And when the
Lyxbonoys toke ony of them they dyd not ſo / 
for the kynge that nowe is of Portyngale made
them to be well kepte at theyr eaſe / & ſo ſent
them agayne in to the ooſt without ony hurte
or domage of theyr perſones / wherfore ſome
ſayd in ye ooſt that it was done of a grete gentylnes / 
for he rendred good for euyll. And ſyr
whyle this ſyege endured whiche was an hole
yere and more / euery weke there was one or
two ſkyrmyſſhes and dedes of armes done / &
ſome hurte and ſlayne on the one parte or on
the other. The kynge of Caſtell helde as well
his ſyege by water as by lande and had plente
of vytaylles / for it came to his ooſt from all
partyes out of Caſtell / and on a day it happened
at a ſkyrmyſſhe that was made at one of ye
gates / ſyr Iohn̄ Laurence of coygne who was
capytayne of the Cyte yſſued out of the barryers
with his penon of the armes of Coygne before
hym / and with hym a good nombre of propre
men of warre / and at that ſkirmyſſhe there
was done many a propre feate of armes / and
many a darte caſt. By my fayth ſayd the duke
of Lancaſtre of all the feates of armes that the
Caſtellyans and they of your countrey dothe
vſe / the caſtynge of theyr dartes beſt pleaſeth
me / & gladly I wolde ſe it / for as I here ſay yf
they ſtryke one aryght / without he be well armed
the darte wyll perce hym thrughe / by my
fayth ſyr ſayd the ſquyer ye ſaye trouthe / for I
haue ſene many a grete ſtroke gyuen wt them / 
whiche at one tyme coſt vs derely and was to
vs grete dyſpleaſure / for at ye ſayd ſkyrmyſſhe
ſyr Iohn̄ Laurence of Coygne was ſtryken wt
a darte in ſuche wyſe that the heed perced all
the plates of his cote of mayle and a iacke ſtopped
with ſylke and paſſed thrughe his body / 
ſo that he fel downe deed / and therwith ſeaſed
the ſkyrmyſſhe bycauſe of ye dethe of yt knyght
and ſo was the lady Elyanoure a wydowe in
one yere of bothe her huſbandes.
            FOr this ſyr Iohan Laurence of Cygne
was made grete mone / for he was a valyaūt
knyght & full of good counſayle / & after
his dethe there was choſen to be capytayne of
Lyxbone a coſyne of his a ryght valyaunt mā
called pouuaſſe of Coyne / he made agaynſt ye
Spanyardes thre or foure yſſues / and dyd to
them grete domage. ¶Thus contynued the
ſyege at Lyxbone / and ſurely often tymes they
within the towne were ſore abaſſhed / for they
coulde ſe no comforte come to them frome ony
parte / and when they ſawe that none came out
of Englonde wheron lay all theyr truſt. Thē
the kynge that nowe is was counſayled to haue
taken a ſhyp / and ſo to haue come hyder in
to Englonde / for ſyr Iohn̄ Vadigothz of paſſe

ſyr Iohn̄ Cete Dore / and the archedeacon of
Lyxbone whom they had ſent hyther in to Englonde
to the kynge here & to you / & to the erle
of Cambrydge your broder for to haue ſome
cōforte & ayde / when they retourned in to Lyxbone
they brought tydynges howe yt ye wolde
haue comforted them / in the name of god ſayd
the duke / all that is of trouthe / & ſo had I done
and was redy and at ye poynte to haue departed / 
but as then the warre of Flaundres and of
Gaunte dyd let me / for the Gauntoys came hyder
for ayde and helpe / and ſo all ſuche or the
mooſt parte of them that ſholde haue gone wt
me in to Portyngale wente in to Flaundres
with ye byſſhop of Norwyche ſyr Henry percy
& ſo that letted my iourney in to Portyngale / 
in the name of god ſayd ye ſquyer / it was thought
amonge vs that there was ſome grete let
in Englonde ſo yt you coulde not come hyder / 
howbeit we dyd as well as we myght / & maynteyned
ourſelfe valyauntly agaynſt the kyng
of Caſtell and all his puyſſaunce / whiche was
no ſmall thynge / for he had mo then .lx.M. mē
by ſee and by lande / and thretened to byrne / &
to exyle vs without mercy. And ſyr thus whyle
this ſyege endured an erle of our countrey
of Portyngale called the erle of Angouſe dyd
vs on a day grete ſocour / wherby he attayned
grete honoure / for he with .xx. Galeys aryued
at the porte of Portyngale with a good nombre
of men of armes & prouyſyon / & ſo came ſaylynge
by ye ſee before Valence / and thrughe ye
grace of god he came by ye kynge of Caſtelles
army as they lay at ancre before Lixbone who
were mo then a .C. grete veſſelles / howbeit he
dyd his entrepryſe ſo gracyouſly / and had the
wynde at ſo good a poynte / that in dyſpyte of
all his enemyes / he entred ſaufely without peryll
with all his galeys in to the hauen of Lyxbone / 
and at his comynge in conquered .iiii.
ſhyppes of his enemyes / & brought them with
hym in to ye hauen / of whoſe comynge all that
were in Lyxbone were ryght ioyous / for it cō
               forted
them gretely. By my fayth ſayd the duke
of Lancaſtre the erle of Angouſe at yt tyme
dyd you a fayre ſeruyce. But nowe fayre Laurence
ſhewe me howe was this ſyege rayſed / 
and by what maner / I wolde gladly here you
ſpeke therof / ſyr ſayd the ſquyer I ſhall ſhewe
you with ryght a good wyll.
            AS I haue ſhewed you the ſyege endured
more then a yere before Lyxbone / &
the kynge of Caſtell had ſworne and auowed
that he wolde not departe frome the ſyege tyll
he had the cyte vnder his obeyſaunce / without
the puyſſaunce of a gretter kynge then he was
rayſed hym therfro by force. And truly al thynges
conſydered the kynge of Caſtel kepte wel
his auowe / for ye puyſſaunce of a gretter kyng
then he was rayſed hym / and cauſed hym to departe / 
I ſhall ſhewe you howe / a peſtylence &
mortalyte meruaylous ferefull fell in his ooſt
in ſuche wyſe that mē dyed ſodeynly / ſpekyng
one to another / there dyed mo then .xx.M. perſones / 
wherof ye kyng was ſore afrayde / wherfore
it was counſayled hym to departe thens / 
and to drawe to ſaynt yrayne / or to ſome other
parte / and breke vp the ſyege / and to gyue leue
to his people to departe tyll the peſtylence
were ſeaſed / whiche he dyd ſore agaynſt his
wyll / bycauſe he had ſworne ſo ſolemply to kepe
ye ſyege / howbeit of neceſſyte he was fayne
to departe. Therfore ſyr we ſay / and hath ben
ſayd in Portyngale / and it is the comon opynyon / 
that god dyd ſende that peſtylence in to
the kyng of Caſtelles ooſt to ayde vs and our
kynge that nowe is / for in the cyte wherin we
were cloſed / there dyed nother man nor womā
of y• ſykenes / this grace god dyd for vs. And
when the kynge of Caſtell dyſlodged fro Lyxbone / 
the kynge of Portyngale that nowe is
cauſed all ſuche as were within the cyte to be
armed / and to lepe on theyr horſes / and to folowe
the trayne of the kynge of Caſtelles ooſt
and there we dyd then grete domage / for they
dyſlodged not in good aray / wherby they 
                  •
               oſt
parte of theyr men & promocyon / but the kyng
of Portyngale made a crye / that on payne of
dethe no ma to take ony thynge yt they founde
in the felde / nor to brynge ony thyng therof in
to the cyte / but commaunded euery thynge to
be brente to the entent that it ſholde brynge no
infeccyon in to the cyte. So prouyſyon & euery
thynge was conuerted in to flame of fyre / 
howbeit I thynke ſuche as founde other golde
or ſyluer in money or place brent it not / but
ſaued it as well as they myght. So thus the
kyng of caſtel wente to ſaynt prayne at ye entre
of his countrey / & there taryed a ſeaſon / & ſent
for more ſocour in to Fraūce / & ſpecyally in to
Gaſcoyne & Byerne / & in to ye lādes of ye erle of
Foys / & he ſent thyder .iii. ſomers laden wt nobles
of caſtel & floreyns to gyue in preſt to knyghtes
& ſquyers / for he knewe well otherwyſe

he ſholde not haue them come out of theyr houſes.
And when the barons and knyghtes of ye
royalme of Portyngale on ye partye of ye kyng
that nowe is ſawe howe the kynge of Caſtell
had rayſed his ſyege / whiche had endured more
then a yere / they toke then grete courage / &
ſo dyd all the comons of the countrey / and ſpecyally
they of Porte Ewre / and Connymbres
Then they toke counſayle togyder ſhortely to
crowne to theyr kynge mayſter Denyce whom
they had choſen and gyuen hym theyr loue / &
ſayd how that it was goddes wyll yt he ſholde
be theyr kynge / for he had ſhewed his vertue
agaynſt the Spanyardes / then a commaundement
was made thrughout all Portyngale
euery mā to come to Cōmmbres at a certayne
daye lymytted to the Coronacyon of mayſter
Denyce / all ſuche as toke his parte came thyder / 
and accordynge to the puyſſaunce of that
royalme there was moche people / there kynge
Iohn̄ of Portyngale was crowned by the
byſſhoppes and prelates of the royalme with
grete ſolempnyte as it aperteyned / on trynyte

                  •
               ondaye the yere of our lorde god .M.CCC.lxxx.
and .iiii. In the cathedrall chyrche of Cō
               nymbres
called ſaynt Maries / whiche daye ye
kyng made newe knyghtes / what of his owne
countrey as of ſtraungers to ye nombre of .lx.
There was kepte a grete feeſt .ii. or .iii. dayes
and there the kynge renewed all homages of
Erles / barons / knyghtes / and ſquyers / and ſuche
as helde of hym / and there the kyng ſware
to kepe the royalme in ryght and Iuſtyce / and
to maynteyne al theyr iuryſdyccyons / and euery
man ſware to take hym for theyr kynge and
his heyres comynge of hym / male / or female
that to dye in the payne neuer to forſake them
thus kynge Iohn̄ of Portyngale was crowned
kynge.
            WHen the kynge of Caſtell knewe how
the comons of Portyngale had crowned
mayſter Denyce to theyr kynge / &
had ſworne to hym faythe and homage / then
he was more dyſpleaſed then he was before / 
for he had thought they wolde not haue done
it ſo ſodeynly bycauſe he had many of the nobles
of Portyngale with hym / then he ſayd. I
ſe well it behoueth me perforce to conquere yt
is myne yf I wyll haue it / there ſhall neuer be
peace bytwene Caſtell and Portyngale tyll ye
Portyngales haue amended yt they haue done
And ſo after the kynge was crowned he came
to Lyxbone / and there taryed & toke grete dylygence
to ſet in a good way ye buſynes of his
royalme / & to gete therby the grace / good wyl
and loue of his people / and ſent his knyghtes
and men of warre in to dyuers garyſons / in
to townes & caſtelles on the fronters of Spayne / 
for ye kynge of Caſtell lay at Sybyll. The
kyng of Portyngale ſent in garyſon to Trentouſe
ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant Perteler / an experte
man of armes / a valyaunt knyght & of hyghe
entrepryſe / and with hym ſyr Martyn Vas of
Coygne / & his broder ſyr Wyllyā Vas two experte
knyghtes / & they had vnder them .CC.
ſperes of good men of warre well horſed / & to
ye caſtell of Lene towarde Iuberoth was ſente
ſyr Iohn̄ Radygos with a .l. ſperes / and to ye
cyte of Valence in Portyngale was ſente ſyr
Iohn̄ Iames of Saulles / to lye in garyſon
agaynſt the ſtronge towne of Tuy / whiche
was as then yelden to ye kynge of Caſtell whē
he came towarde Lyxbone / and in Tuy there
lay in a garyſon a grete nombre of men of armes
Frenſſhe and Caſtellyans / and to ye cyte
of Serpe was ſente ſyr Nondech Radygo a
noble knyght with .l. ſperes / but to Porte / to
Ewre / and to Connymbres was ſente no men
of warre / for the kynge thought them ſtronge
ynoughe of themſelfe / and true and faythfull
to hym. Thus ſyr in the ſame yere yt the kyng
was thus crowned / the garyſons were well
prouyded for / and often tymes there were encountrynges / 
ſkyrmyſſhes / and aſſawtes on
bothe partyes / one tyme our men wanne / and
another tyme they loſt as the aduenture of armes
falleth / but ſpecyally there was afore encountre
by them of the garyſon of Treucouſe
agaynſt the Caſtellyans. A Laurence ſayd ye
duke of Lanclaſtre paſſe not the matter ſo breuely / 
but let me knowe howe it was and what
was done when they mette in the feldes / for I
wolde gladly here ſpekyng of dedes of armes
Syr ſayd the ſquyer I ſhall ſhewe you what
was there done / for at the ſame renconntre I
was preſent & bare yt day ye baner of ſyr Iohn
Ferant Perteler by whom the buſynes began
for he was as then capytayne of Treutouſe.
            THe kynge of Caſtell had prouyded mē
of warre on ye fronters of Portyngale
who ſomtyme do to vs domage aſſembled thē
ſelfe togyder and toke ye feldes / and ſomtyme
loſt and ſomtyme wanne. And ſo on a ſeaſon a
vii. capytaynes of Spanyardes good knyghtes
and of hyghe lygnage aſſembled them togyder
with the nombre of .iii.C. ſperes well

horſed hauynge grete deſyre to do vs domage
as they well ſhewed / for they came and entred
in to Portyngale and toke a grete praye and
many pryſoners / and yf they had wolde they
myght haue entred agayne in to Caſtell with
out ony encountrynge / but they were ſoo hyghe
mynded and prowde that they ſayd they
wolde goo and ſe the garyſon of Treutouſe / 
they of ye playne countrey fledde before them / 
ſoo that tydynges of them came in to Treutouſe / 
and when ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Partelere
knewe the Caſtellyans rode abrode / he called
for his harneys / and cauſed the trompettes to
beſowned / and ſo awoke all the knyghtes and
ſquyres in the towne / euery man armed hym
in grete haſte / and mounted on theyr horſes / 
and yſſued out of Treutouſe / and when they
were in ye feldes they were a .CC. & ſo put thē
               ſelfe
in good ordre / and ſhewed howe they had
grete affeccyon to fynde theyr enemyes / and
demaunded of them that came flyenge in to ye
towne where theyr enemyes were / and they
anſwered and ſayd howe they were not farre
thens / and howe they rode but a ſofte pace bycauſe
of the grete praye that they caryed with
them / With thoſe tydynges ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant
Partelere was ryght ioyous and ſayd to his
company / as to ſyr Iohn̄ Martyne of Vas / &
ſyr Wyllyam Vas his broder. Syrs I requyre
you let vs auaunce forwarde I wyll not entre
in to ony towne or Caſtell in Portyngale
tyll I haue ſene our enemyes / and fyght with
them / and put to my payne and trauayle to recouer
the praye and pryſoners that they leede
with them / and then he ſayd to me. Laurence
dyſplay my baner / for it is tyme / we ſhall fynde
ſhortely our enemyes / then I dyd as he cō
               maunded
me / and ſo we rode forthe a good pace / 
and at the laſt we ſawe where the duſt roſe
with the horſes of our enemyes / then we toke
the vauntage of the ſone and came on them / &
when ye Caſtellyans ſawe vs they helde themſelfe
cloſe togyder / and ordred themſelfe / and
ſet theyr pryſoners and pray on theyr one ſyde
& we approched ſo nere togyder that we myght
ſpeke to them / and they to vs / and then we
ſawe howe they had .iii. baners / and .iiii. penons / 
and to our Iudgement a .CCC. horſe.
Fyrſt there was ſyr Iohn̄ Radigos de Caſtenans
knyght and baron in Caſtell / ſyr Sylue
grefye of Albenes / ſyr Adioutall of Tolet of
Caſſell / ſyr Iohn̄ Radigo of Eure / and Dioſtenſes
of Angouſe / & when we were before thē
we lyghted on foote / and in lykewyſe ſoo dyd
they / and delyuered theyr horſes to pages and
varlettes / and or we began to caſt darces or to
doo ony feate of armes the capytaynes ſpake
eche to other / I that was there preſent herde
all the wordes that were ſpoken on bothe partyes / 
for my mayſter ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Partelere
whoſe baner I bare was one of ye formeſt
and ye wordes that were ſpoken were by hym
and to hym. Fyrſt he demaunded why they rode
in Portyngale ledynge away ſuche prayes
and pryſoners as they had taken / then ſyr Adioutall
of Tolet anſwered and ſayd they wolde
ryde as they lyſt / to punyſſhe them that be
dyſobeyſaunt to the kynge of Caſtel to whom
the herytage of Portyngale perteyned / and by
rauſe they founde them rebelles / therfore they
ſayd they ouer rynne y• countrey & take prayes
and pryſoners. Well ſyrs ſayd ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant
ye ſhall not lede them longe / for we wyll
reſcue them / ye haue noo ryght to come and to
ouer rynne this countrey / ye knowe wel ynoughe
we haue a kynge all redy who wyll kepe
his royalme in ryght and kepe Iuſtyce / & punyſſhe
theues and robbers. Therfore we ſaye
vnto you in his behalfe / all that ye haue taken
in the royalme of Portyngale leue it behynde
you and departe hens / or elles in our ryght &
iuſt quarell we wyll fyght with you / then the
Spanyardes anſwered / ye pryſoners that we
haue taken we wyll not delyuer agayne / but
as for ye other praye we wyll take aduyſe. Thē
the .vii. capytaynes of Caſtell drewe them togyder / 
and ſhewed that for all that they were
come to ſe the garyſon of Treutouſe / yet they
wolde haue ben glad to haue departed without
batayle / and when they had counſayled / 
thē they ſayd howe they wolde leue theyr pray
behynde them / but the pryſoners they wolde
lede with them / Nay not ſo ſayd the Portyngales / 
for we wyll ye leue all / or elles ye ſhall
haue batayle / and ſo wente togyder / and there
was a ſore batayle for there were on bothe partyes
good men of warre / and the felde where
as they fought was fayre and playne they caſt
eche at other dartes ſo ſore that who ſoo euer
was ſtryken without he were wel armed was
ſlayne or ſore hurte / there were many propre
feates of armes done / and there ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant
Partelere fought with an axe ryght valyauntly / 
and ſo dyd his .ii. companyons / on
the other partye the Spanyardes fought ryght
valyauntly. Thus they fought the ſpace
of .iii. houres / whiche was meruayle that mē
coulde endure ſo longe in theyr armure fyghtynge / 

but the grete dyſyre that eyther partye
had to wynne honoure cauſed them to endure
the more payne / and ſyr ſurely Spanyardes
and Portyngales are harde men in batayle / 
& ſpecyally when they ſe it is of neceſſyte / thus
they fought longe that no mā knewe who had
the better / theyr batayle was ſo egall. And ſyr
thanked be god there was nother baner nor
penon on our ſyde that day ouerthrowen / but
fynally theyr ſyde began to open and were beten
downe on euery ſyde / ſo that the dyſcomfyture
fell on them / then theyr pages fled awaye
to ſaue themſelfe / and of the .vii. capytaynes yt
were there preſent / there ſcaped away but one
& that was ye meanes of his page who brought
hym his horſe / he dyd his mayſter good
ſeruyce that day / and yt was Adyentall Caſſel
all the other .vi. were ſlayne / for there was neuer
a man taken to raunſome. Thus ſyr Iohn̄
Ferrant Partelere & his company obtayned
the vyctory of theyr enemyes / who were thre
agaynſt two / and this was on a tuyſday in the
moneth of Octobre nere to Treutouſe / in the
yere of our lorde .M.CCC.lxxx. and .iiii.

               ANd after this dyſcomfyture
on our enemyes our
men mounted on theyr horſes
/ and there we delyuered
ſuche pryſoners as the Caſtellyans
had taken before / &
alſo gaue them ſuche pyllage
as theyr enemyes had gotten / excepte ye beeſtes
whiche were in nombre an .viii. hundreth
all thoſe we draue in to the garyſon of Treutouſe
for vatayllynge of the towne as it was
reaſon / & there we were receyued with grete
ioye they wyſt not what chere to make vs bycauſe
we had delyuered y• coūtrey of theyr enemyes / 
& reſcued that they had loſt / wherby we
had grete prayſe thrughe all ye townes of Portyngale / 
& ſyr in the ſame yere our men had another
fayre iourney on theyr enemyes in ye felde
of Sybylle / but ſyr fyrſt I ſhall ſhewe you
the mooſt happyeſt iourney that the kynge of
Portyngale had or ony kynge before hym in
.CC. yere before / whiche was done within .iiii
monethes before that yt kynge ſente vs hyther
our enemyes were .iiii. agaynſt one of good
men of warre and of hyghe empryſe / wherfore
our iourney ought to be ye more prayſed. But
ſyr I thinke ye haue herde therof al redy / wherfore
I thynke beſt to ſpeke not therof / nay ſayd
the duke ye ſhall not leue ſo / ye ſhall ſhewe me
the hole proceſſe / for I wolde gladly here you
ſpeke therof / yet of trouthe I haue an heraulte
here with me called Derby who was there at
the batayle as he ſayth / and he ſhewed me that
ſuche Englyſſhe men as were there dyd meruaylles
in armes / and more by his reporte thē
I bileue was of trouth / for there was no grete
nombre of them wherby ony grete feate ſholde
be done by them / for my broder ye erle of Cambrydge
when he came out of Portyngale brought
agayne with hym ſuche Englyſſhmen as
wente thyder. But there be many of theſe Heraultes
be ſuche lyers that they wyll exalte ſuche
as they lyſt beyonde meaſure / But for all
that the noblenes of them that be good is not
loſt nor enpayred thoughe it be not ſhewed by
them. Therfore it is good to knowe it by the
reporte of other that knoweth it. ¶Syr ſayd
Laurence of all the ſtraungers that were at

there paſſed not a two hundred men
Englyſſhe / Gaſcoynes / and Almaynes / and
the gretteſt capytaynes that were there of the
ſtraungers were two Gaſcoynes / and one of
Almayne of the duchy of Guerles. The Gaſcoynes
were called ſyr Wyllyam of mountferrant / 
and Bernardon / and ye Almayne Albert
of Englyſſhmē there were a certayne archers
but I herde none named / but .ii. ſquyers Northbery
and Hartecell / and they were called to
counſayle with the kynge and other lordes before
the batayle. Well ſayd the duke proſede
forthe & tell me of that iourney & howe it was
fought I requyre you / ſyr ſayd ye ſquyer with
ryght a good wyl / for ſyr to ſhewe you & other
howe it was I am ſente hyther fro the kynge
my mayſter.
            THen Laurence Fongaſe renewed his
tale and ſpake of the buſynes of Iuberoth
and ſayd thus / ſyr ye haue herde by me / &
alſo by other that after the coronacyon of the
kynge of Portyngale at Connymbres / yt kyng
of Caſtell who had rayſed his ſyege fro Lyxbone
/ for the dethe of peſtylence that fell in his

               
                  •
               oſt / and ſo wente to yrayne / and it was ſayd
howe it greued hym ſore when he was enfourmed
of the coronacyon of my redoubted lorde
kynge Iohn̄ of Portyngale / for the kynge of
Caſtell claymed and yet dothe ryght in the herytage
and crowne of Portyngale by the tytle
of his wyfe doughter to kynge Ferrant whiche
we denyed and yet do / for ſuche cauſe as I
haue ſhewed you before / ſo thus the kynge of
Caſtell was counſayled to ſende for mē of war
where he myght gete them / and ſpecyally in to
Fraunce / for ye frenſſhmen had alwayes ayded
hym & ſuſteyned his quarell / and ye kynge his
fader in lykewyſe / and it was ſayd to hym by
his counſayle / ye nede nothynge but one iourney
agaynſt them of Portyngale / for by puyſſaunce
if ye may kepe the felde and fyght with
them thē ye ſhal come to your entente / for there
is grete varyaunce all redy in Portyngale as
ye ſe and perceyue well / for there is here with
you of the nobleſt perſones of ye royalme / and
they haue ſubmytted thēſelfe vnder your obeyſaunce / 
whiche thynge gretely furdereth your
warre / if ye auaunce yourſelfe with puyſſaūce
to fyght to this baſtārde of portyngale whom
yt comons haue crowned to theyr kynge or he
gete ayde of the Englyſſhemen / ye are lyke to
ouerthrowe hym / and yf ye wynne the iourney
all the royalme is yours / for it is no grete matter
to wyn it after / ſoo by ſuche counſayle and
other thynges Iohn̄ of Caſtell auaunced hym
ſelfe to ſende letters & meſſageres in to Fraunce / 
Poictou / Bretayne / Normandy / Borgon
& in to dyuers other places where as he thought
to haue men of armes / knyghtes & ſquyres
for his money or for loue / or ſuche as helde ony
thynge of hym / and ſpecyally there came many
knyghtes & ſquyres to hym out of Byerne / 
and ſo on a daye as he was at ſaynt yrayne he
auewed his people to ye nombre of .vi. or .vii.c.
ſperes & .xxx.M. ſpanyardes all on horſoacke
all hauynge deſyre to do vs domage.
            TIdynges came in to Portyngale to the
kynge and to ye lordes there / & to them
of the good townes and cytees ſuche as were
of the kynges partye / and it was ſhewed there
what nombre and puyſſaunce the kynge of Caſtell
was of / and howe he was fully determyned
to come and lay fyege agayne to Lyxbone
then the kynge of Portyngale & his counſayle
aſſembled togyder / & there the moſt notableſt
perſones of his royalme ſayd yt the kyng were
beſt to go out of the cyte and to mete with his
enemyes rather then to be encloſed in ony cyte
or towne in Portyngale / for yf they were beſyeged
they ſholde haue moche buſynes to defende
them & theyr cyte / and in the meane ſeaſon
ye Caſtellyans myght ryde abrode at theyr
eaſe where as they lyſt and conquere townes / 
Cytees / & Caſtelles / outher by force or by loue
and dyſtroy all ye playne countrey / and peraduenture
at lengthe them within the cyte / wherfore
they ſayd to the kynge. Syr yf we go out
agaynſt them and take a place conuenyent to
fyght / we thynke this were beſt and mooſt profytable / 
for ſyr we knowe well ye ſhall not peaſybly
enioy the crowne of Portyngale wherwith
we haue crowned you without it be by
batayle / and that at the leeſt ones or twyſe to
ouerthrowe your aduerſary the kynge of Caſtell
and his puyſſaunce & yf we may dyſcomfyte
hym / then we ſhal be lordes of the country
And yf we be ouercome the royalme is in aduenture / 
but better it were for vs to ſeke batayle
then to be ſought on / and more honourable
it were for vs / for ſyr it hathe ben often tymes
ſene that the ſetters an hath auauntage of the
defenders / therfore ſyr we wyll counſayle you
to ſende forthe your letters and meſſagers to
all ſuche as ye thynke wyll ſerue you. Then ye
kynge anſwered and ſayd / ſyrs ye ſpeke wel &
I wyl do as ye haue ordeyned. Then ye kynge
ſet his clarkes on warke to wryte letters and
wrote to euery man that they ſholde come to
the porte of Portyngale or nere there aboute
at a certayne day lymytted / howbeit all ſuche
as were wryten vnto came not thyder / for as
then all the royalme toke not full parte with
hym / but dyſſmuled and taryed to ſe howe ye
matters ſholde frame at lengthe / & ſome were
gone out of theyr owne countrey to the kynge
of Caſtell bycauſe they ſayd that the kynge of
Caſtell had more ryght to the crowne of Portyngale
then our kynge had / howbeit for all yt
the kynge my ſouerayne lorde wente to Connymbres
and there made his aſſemble of ſuche
men of warre as he coulde gete / and truely he
had with hym yt choyſe men of all Portyngale
and of mooſt auctoryte as of Erles / Barons / 
knyghtes & ſquyers / & alſo he had a .xxv. hundred
ſperes of ſquyers / and a .xii.M. foote mē
Then he ordeyned a Conſtable and marſhall
The conſtable was the erle of Nauare / ye marſhall
ſyr Alne Perriere bothe ryght ſage knyghtes
to conduyte men of warre / then they departed
fro Connymbres and toke the waye to
Cabaſe that is Iuberoth and rode fayre and

eaſely to eaſe themſelfe and theyr horſes / and yt
theyr / prouyſyon myght folowe them in good
ordre / and they had rore ryders one before to

               ewe the demeanynge of the Caſtellyans / at
this tyme ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Pertelere was
not come to the kynge / he was at the garyſon
of Dorech a .v. legges fro Iuberoth / & I thynke
he knewe not as then that the kynge ſholde
fyght with his enemyes.
            I Suppoſe the kynge of Caſtell was wel
enfourmed howe the kynge of Portyngale
was comynge to hym warde with his puyſſaunce / 
and when he knewe it he had therof
grete ioy / & ſo had all his men as they ſhewed / 
& anone they determyned to come on agaynſt
vs / and to tyght with vs / & ſpecyally ye gaſcoynes
of Byerne that were there ſore deſyred to
fyght with vs / for they deſyred to haue ye fyrſt
batayle / and ſo they had / and ſyr Wyllyam of
Mounferrant a Gaſcoyne who was there on
our partye ſayd ſurely howe we ſholde haue
batayle bycauſe they of Byerne were agaynſt
vs who euer deſyreth nothynge but batayle.
¶Then the kynge of Caſtell with all his batayle
came the nexte daye and lodged at the caſtell
of Lerre a two legges fro Iuberoth / and
the nexte day we came to the Cabaſe & lodged
there and yt nyght the kynge of Caſtel lodged
but a lytell legge fro Iuberoth / for he knewe
well what way we toke / and howe we lodged
at Iuberoth.
            Syr the Portyngales hath had alwayes

good 
                  •
               ortune of yt place of Iuberoth & therfore
they at that tyme reſted there / Why ſayd ye
duke haue they ſo good hope in that place rather
then in another / ſyr layd the ſquyer / auncyently
ye grete Charlemayne who was kyngge
of Fraunce and of Almayne / & Emperoure
of Rome who was in his tyme a grete conqueroure
at this place of Iuberoth / he dyſcomfyted
.vii. kynges of ye myſereauntes / and there
were ſlayned of ye infydelles a .C.M. This ſyr
is auncyently founde in hyſtoryes and cronycles
and by reaſon of that batayle he conquered
Coanymbres & all the countrey of Portyngale
& brought it in to cryſten fayth / and bycauſe
of ye grete victore yt he had there agaynſt
goddes enemyes he founded there an abbaye
of blacke monkes / and gaue them grete rente
in Portyngale & in Caſtell / & alſo ſyr aboute a
CC. yere paſt there was at the ſame place a
grete betayle & fayre iourney acheued by a lorde
that was at that tyme broder to the kyng of
Caſtell / for before that tyme there was neuer
kynge in Portyngale / it was called the countye
of Portyngale / and ſo it was that theſe .ii.
bretherne ye kynge of Caſtell & the erle of Portyngale
had mortall warre togyder for partycyon
of landes ſo yt there coulde be founde no
peas bytwene them but mortall warre togyder.
The matter touched ſoo moche the erle of
Portyngale & the Portyngales yt they had rather
to haue ben deed then to haue ben vnder
the ſubieccyon of the kynge of Caſtel / & ſo they
toke a day of batayle / & there the kynge of Caſtell
was ſo puyſſaūt yt he was .x. agaynſt one
ſo yt he ſet nothynge by the Portyngales / ſo at
the cabaſe of Iuberoth was theyr batayle ryght
cruell / & fynally the Portyngales obteyned
y• vyctory / & the Caſtellyans dyſcomfyted
& the kynge of Caſtell taken / by whoſe takynge
the erle of Portyngale had peas as he lyſt / 
then the boundes were ſet of the departyng of
Caſtell and Portyngale.
            ANd then bycauſe ye Portyngales ſaw
yt god had ſente them the vyctory with
ſo ſmal a nombre agaynſt ſo grete a puyſſaunce / 
then they thought to augment theyr lande
& to make it a royalme / ſo ye prelates & nobles
of the countrey crowned theyr fyrſt kynge at
Connymbres & made hym to ryde thrughout
his royalme with a crowne of Lawrell on his
heed / ſygnyfyenge honoure & vyctory as aunently
kynges were wonte to do / & ſo euer ſyth
the royalme hath had a kynge / for ſyr ſurely rather
then the Portyngales wolde be vnder ye
ſubieccyon of the Caſtellyans they wolde take
one or other that were ferre of fro the blood of
ye kynge of Portyngale / & the kynge were deed
without yſſue male / & ſyr when ye kynge of portyngale
that nowe is came to the place of Iuberoth / 
all theſe matters were ſhewed hym / &
thus whyles that the conſtable and marſhall
were orderynge of theyr batayles there came
to the kynge ſyr Iohn Ferrant Partelere who
came the ſame morenynge fro his garyſon of
Dorech & brought with hym .lx. ſperes / ye kynge
had grete ioye of his comynge / & when all
our bataylles were ordeyned & that we abode
for nothynge but for our enemyes / & that our
fore ryders were ſente forth to aſpye theyr dealynge
/ the kynge then my ſouerayne lorde came
in amonge his men & cauſed fylence to be
made / & then he ſayd / ſyrs ye haue crowned me

kynge / ſhewe nowe your trouth & faythfulnes
for ſyth I am ſo forwarde / & ſpecyally in this
place of Iuberoth I ſhal neuer retourne agayne
in to Portyngale without I fyght wt myne
enemyes / then euery man anſwered and ſayd
ſyr we ſhall all abyde wt you / & knowe for trouthe
we ſhall not flye this daye.
            TThus the batayles approched / for the
Caſtellyans had grete deſyre to fynde
vs & to fyght as they well ſhewed / & we ſente
forthe our fore ryders to ſe & knowe what our
enemyes dyd / & they taryed fro vs more then
.iii. houres / & that we herde no / tydynges of thē
ſo that we thought we had loſt them / howbeit
at ye laſt they retourned & brought vs ſure worde
of them & what nombre they were of by all
lykelyhode / & they ſhewed vs howe theyr vowarde
were a .vii.M. men of armes armed capa
pee as freſſhe & as well horſed as coulde be
deuyſed / & in ye kynge of Caſtelles rerewarde
there were a .xxx.M. horſe of good men of armes.
And when our kynge and his company
knewe the nombre of theyr enemyes & howe yt
theyr vowarde were a .ii. legges before ye kynge / 
for the Gaſcoynes & ſtraungers were not
well of accorde with the Caſtellyans / then we
determyned to kepe vs cloſe togyder in our
ſtrength / & to make .ii. wynges to our batayle
& our men of armes wherof we had but .ii.M.
& .CCCCC. ſperes to be bytwene the .ii. wynges / 
ſyr there myght well haue ben ſene good
ordre of batayle & people well recomforted / &
then it was cōmaunded by the kyng on payne
of dethe yt no man take that daye no pryſoner / 
this was determyned amonge vs for the beſt / 
for as ye lordes & capytaynes ſayd / if we ſholde
entende to take pryſoners it ſholde deceyue vs
& make vs take no hede of yt we ſholde do / for
it was ſayd that it were better for vs to fyght
wel then to take hede of takynge of pryſoners
& to ſel our lyues derely as good people ought
to do. This worde was vpholden & obſerued
then our enemyes came before vs cloſe togyder
lyke good men of warre / & then alyghted
on foote & trymmed theyr harneys & let theyr
horſes go / & ſo came & approched vs fyerſly / ſurely
there was the floure of chyualry / and that

then they aſſembled them agaynſt vs / for they
thought yt the kynge of Caſtell with his grete
batayle had folowed them at hande but it was
not ſo / for they were all dyſcomfyted & ſlayne
or the kynge of Caſtell came nere hande vs / I
ſhal ſhewe you by what meanes they were cloſed
in bytwene vs / & the comons of our countrey / 
who layde on behynde them with axes &

armes who were freſſhe came on agaynſt thē /

            THus clerely without recouery the vowarde
of our enemyes were dyſcomfyted / 
then came the kynge of Caſtel with his batayle
wherin he had .xxx.M. men well horſed
but when they approched it was nere nyght / &
they knewe nothynge what myſchefe was fallen

on a tyme the erle of Nauare conſtable of Portyngale
entred in to Caſtell in to the feldes of

whyle ye Caſtellyans were arguynge our mē
paſſed oure a lytell water yt was behynde thē / 

& there toke a grete groūde & fortefyed it / & made

contynued theyr aſſaulte fro noone tyll it was

Thus ſyr at your requeſt I haue ſhewed you
the maner of our countrey / and all yt I knowe
of the kynge and all his counſayle / and by thē
I was cōmaunded at my departyng fro them
to ſhewe you euery thynge yt I knewe. Wherfore
ſyr it maye pleaſe you that I myght haue
an anſwere / Laurence ſayd the duke or this tyme▪
I haue ſhewed you / and yet agayne I ſay
it that your comynge and theſe tydynges doth
me grete pleaſure / and ye ſhall not departe fro
me tyll ye be ſatyſfyed of all your requeſtes / &
well anſwered in that ye be come for / ſyr ſayd
the ſquyer I thanke you / then the duke called
for wyne & ſpyces / & ſo toke theyr leue & wente
to theyr lodgynge to Arcorch to the houſe of ye
Fawcon in London / there they were lodged
with Thomelyn of Colebrunque.
            ANd it was not longe after but that the
duke of Lancaſtre and the erle of Cambrydge
his broder had counſayle togyder of yt
buſyneſ▪ of Caſtell and Portyngale / wherof ye
erle of Cambrydge was well contente / for he
had ben in yt countrey before / more then a yere
and he was glad to here of the condycyons &
tytles of the kynge of Portyngale / and of the
quene of Caſtell / and ſayd to his broder / ſyr
when kynge Ferrant lyued / the Chanon Robſart
and ſyr Wyllyam Wyndeſore and dyuers
other knyghtes yt were there with me ſhewed
me as it is nowe fallen / for they ſayd how they
had herde dyuers of ye ſame coūtrey murmure
on the quene of Caſtelles tytle to Portyngale
therfore I toke away with me my ſone / & had
no grete affeccyon to that maryage / In the name
of god ſayd ye duke / the ſquyer that is here
of Portyngale hathe declared all the matter / 
and I thynke we can not haue ſo fayre an entre
in to Caſtell as by Portyngale / for the royalme
of Aragon is ferre of / and alſo the kynge
there and his chyldren haue alwayes ben more
fauourable to the frenſſhe partye thenne to
vs / Therfore it were not good ſyth the kynge
of Portyngale maketh for vs this good 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
to refuſe it. So on a day for this matter there
was a parlyament holden at Weſtmynſtre / &
there it was accorded yt the duke of Lancaſtre
ſholde haue at the coſtes of ye royalme bitwene
a .M. & .xii.C. ſperes of choſen men / & .ii.M.
archers / & a .M. of other yomen / & they were
all paydein hande for halfe a yere & therwith
all the kynges vncles were well contente & ſpecyally
the duke of Lancaſtre to whom pryncypally
ye matter touched / & as he yt ſholde be chefe
of ye armye / and to dyſpatche theſe ambaſſadours
of Portyngale / the kynge of Englande
wrote to the kynge of Portyngale louynge letters
conteynyng grete amyte yt he wolde bere
to Portyngale / & grete gyftes were gyuē to ye
mayſter of ſaynt Iaques in Portyngale / & to
Laurence Fongaſe who was alwayes with ye

& ſo on a day theſe ambaſſadours toke theyr leue

& the nexte day they were delyuered / & as I vn

they were in the hauen of the porte of Portyngale / 
at whiche tyme the kynge was there and
was ryght ioyfull of theyr comynge.
            ANd there ye grete mayſter of ſaynt Iaques

ſhewed ye kynge & his counſayle al yt they

whiche certefyed al theyr ſaynges / then anone

deſyred the ayde out of Englande to ye entente
to cauſe his enemyes to haue the more fere) determyned

was cōmaunded thus to do / & he incontynent
dyd ſo and ſo on a daye departed fro the porte
of Portyngale and in .vi. dayes he arryued at
Bryſtowe / at whiche ſeaſon the lordes of Englande
/ for ye mooſt parte were aboute ye marches
of Wales / for the kynge was there when
the duke of Lancaſtre knewe of the comynge
of theſe ſhyppes he was ryght ioyfull. Then
knyghtes & ſquyers and al ſuche as ſholde go
with hym were ſente for / ſo that in the porte of
Bryſtowe there were .CC. veſſelles with the
flete of Portyngale redy apparelled for ye duke
and his company / and the dukes entencyon
was to haue with hym his wyfe & his chyldrē
& to make with them ſome good maryages in
caſtel & in Portyngale or his retourne agayne
in to Englande / for he thought not ſhortely to
retourne / for he ſaw the buſynes in Englande
lykely to be harde and ſharpe / & how the kyng
his neuewe was yonge and had aboute hym
peryllous counſayle / wherfore he was ye gladder
to be gone / & or he departed in the preſence
of his bretherne / he ordeyned his ſone ye lorde
Henry erle of Darby his lieutenaunt of all yt

& was ſone to the duches of Lancaſtre the lady

I neuer ſawe .ii. better ladyes nor of

I ſholde lyue this thouſande yeres whiche is

            WHen duke Iohn̄ of Lancaſtre had ordred
all his buſynes in Englonde thē
he toke leue of the kyng & of his bretherne / 
and ſo he wente to Bryſtowe / & there
taryed a .xv. dayes & ſhypped all his horſes &

tawle yomē / they had a fayre ſeaſon as in ye moneth
of May whiche is lyghtly pleaſaunt and
peaſyble / and ſo they ſayled cooſtynge the Ile
of wyght and Gernſey tyll they came open on
ye cooſt of Normandy they were .CC. ſayles &
it was a grete beautye to ſe the galeys glyde
on the ſee approchynge the lande full of men of
armes and arches ſekynge for ſome aduentures / 
for it was ſayd to them that the armye of
Normandy was on the ſee / and truely ſo they
were tyll the Englyſſhe flete appered before ye
boundes of Ouarentyne / but they knewe by
theyr balengers that the armye of Englande
was comynge / and therfore they withdrewe
themſelfe in to the hauen of Harflewe.
            THere is lyghtely nothynge but that it
is knowen / and ſpecyally of dedes of
armes / for lordes / knyghtes / and ſquyers wyl
gladly talke togyder therof / When the dyſcomfyture
was at Iuberoth where as the kynge
of Caſtell toke ſuche loſſe as ye haue herde / tydynges
therof came in to Franuce as it was
reaſon / for there were many there that had loſt
at ye batayle theyr frendes and kynſmen / and
as then there was no warre ſo lykely to be as
in Caſtell / alſo they herde true reporte howe ye
duke of Lancaſtre claymed as his ryght enherytaunce
the herytage of Caſtell / and howe he
had rayſed in Englonde a grete armye to the
entente to drawe in to Caſtell or in to Portyngale / 
ſo then knyghtes & ſquyers of ye low marches
to auaunce theyr honoure drewe & ſente
eche to other to determyne howe they myght
beſt drawe in to Caſtell / ſome coūſayled to go
thyder by lande to eſchewe ye perylles of ye ſee / 
& alſo to ſcape fro the encountrynge of ye Englyſſhe
nauye / & ſome ſayd nay therto / for they
ſayd ye paſſage by lande was ouer longe. And
alſo they thought yt the kynge of Nauare was
not clerely fauourable to ye frenſſhe partye / for
the frenſſhmen & he loued but ſmally togyder / 
for it was ſayd / & true it was the frenſſhe men
had taken fro hym all his enherytaūce in Normādy / 
howbeit I can not tell yf his quarel were
iuſt or not / ſo thus theſe cōpanyōs doubted
gretely the perylles yt myyght fall by goynge
by lande as well for the kynge of Nauare as
for other / & they thought they ſholde neuer come
there by the way thrugh Aragon / ſo at laſt
they concluded to go to Rochell as they dyd / &
there to take theſe / there they rygged an .xviii
veſſelles & toke but fewe horſes wt them / & whē
they were all redy & had wynde at theyr wyll / 
they entred in to theyr veſſelles & ſo ſayled towarde
Bayon / for yt waye or nere therto / they
muſt nedes paſſe / & in yt company there was ye
lorde of Courſey / ſyr Iohn̄ Handoy / ye vycoūt

they were a .CCC. knyghtes & ſquyers of choſen
men deſyrynge armes / thus they ſayled by
the ſee & had wynde and wether as they wolde
wyſſhe / & ſo aryued without peryl or domage
at the porte of ſaynt Andrewe in Byſquay / in
ye yere of our lorde .M.iii.C.lxxx. & .vi. ye .xiiii
day of the moneth of May.
            WHen theſe knyghtes & ſquyers of Fraū
were aryued at ſaynt Andrewes there
they refreſſhed them .ii. dayes / & in that
ſpace they drew out of theyr ſhyppes theyr horſes
& bagages / then they ſet forthe & demaunded
where they ſholde fynde the kynge of Caſtell / 
& it was ſhewed them howe they ſholde
fynde hym in the cyte of Burgus in Spayne
where as thē he had a grete counſayle for ye buſynes
of his royalme. Theſe knyghtes & ſquyers
toke theyr way to Burgus / & ſo came thyder / 
& the kynge of Caſtell was ryght ioyfull
of theyr comynge / & demaūded of them tydynges
of Fraunce & what way they came thyder
They anſwered howe they came by the ſee fro
Rochel & how it was ſayd in fraūce yt the duke
of Lancaſtre had a grete army of mē of armes
& archers to come ye ſame ſeaſon in to Caſtel or
elles in to Portyngale / & alſo how ye kynge of
Portyngale had ſent a nōbre of galeys & other
ſhyppes in to Englāde for hym / of theſe tydynges
ye kyng of Spayne was more penſyue thē
he was before / how be it he made no ſemblaunt
but well he thought he ſholde haue ſore warre

in that ſeaſon / how be it he made good chere to
theſe knyghtes and ſquyers of Fraunce & thanked
them gretely of theyr comynge. And then
he ſayd to ſyr Robert of Braquemont / and to
ſyr Iohn̄ his broder. Syrs when ye departed
fro me the yere that is paſt I deſyred you that
when ſoeuer ye retourned agayne hyder that
ye ſholde brynge with you tenyſe balles of Parys
for vs to play togyder / how be it it had ben
better I hadde charged you to haue brought
good ba
                  •
               ſenetes / & good harneys / for I thynke
we ſhall fynde the ſeaſon well to enploye
them. Syr ſayd the knyght / we haue brought
of bothe / ſyr alwayes we can not be armed nor
alwayes play. Thus the kynge of Caſtell made
them ryght good chere / then they had affeccyon
to god on pylgrymage to ſaynt Iames
ſyth they were in ye countrey and ſome of them
had auowed ſo to do / ſo they rode all togyder
for company / and truſſed with them all theyr
harneys as thought they ſholde haue gone to
batayle / & they dyd wyſely in theyr ſo doynge / 
for it ſtode them in good ſtede or they retourned
agayne as ye ſhall here after. Nowe let vs
retourne to ye duke of Lancaſtres armye who
were on the cooſt of Normandy.
            IN lyke maner as by cōparyſon as fawcons / 
pelegrynes that haue ſtande and

                  •
               eſted longe on the perche hath grete deſyre to
flye abrode / In lyke maner the knyghtes and
ſquyers of Englonde deſyred to fynde dedes
of armes to auaunce themſelfe / and ſayd eche
to other / Why do ye not aryue & go ſe the boundes
& portes of Normandy / there be knyghtes
and ſquyers to awake vs / and to fyght with
vs / theſe wordes multyplyed that it came to ye
dukes eyres / and the duke or he departed out
of Englonde knewe that ſyr Iohn̄ of Maleſtroyt / 
and the lorde of Cambor & Morfonac / 
and a grete nombre of knyghtes and ſquyers
of Bretayne lay at the ſyege in baſtydes before
the caſtell of Breſt by the commaundement
of the conſtable of Fraunce. So when ye duke
herde of the grete deſyre yt his men had to fynde
ſome dedes of armes / then he ſayd to his admyrall
ſyr Thomas Percy / and to the conſtable
of his armye ſyr Iohn̄ Holande commaundynge
them to addreſſe theyr nauey towarde
Bretayne ſayenge howe he wolde goo and ſe
the caſtell of Breſt to vyſyte & comforte ye companyons
therin & to loke on thē yt be without
in the baſtyde / of theſe tydynges ye Englyſſhe
men were ioyful. Then Alphons Vietat chefe
patron of the nauey of Portyngale who knew
ryght well the way and the entrees in to Bretayne / 
whiche were ryght peryllous & daungerous / 
he made his Galey to lede the trace &
ſhewed ye way to other. The ſeaſon was ſayre
& pleaſaunt / & the ſee peaſyble / ſoo they ſayled
towarde the hauen of Breſt / & then taryed for
the tyde / for they knewe well with the fludde
they ſholde in to ye hauen of Breſt / grete pleaſure
it was to here the trompettes & claryons
The ſame ſeaſon ſyr Iohn̄ of Maleſtroyt the
vycount of Combor & Morfonac were ſyttynge
at dyner / whē tydynges came to them how
the Englyſſhe armye was come then they roſe
and armed them / for they knewe wel that whē
ye duke of Lancaſtre had taken lande he wolde
fyght with them and rayſe theyr baſtydes / ſoo
they were all well armed and of good mynde
to defende them yf they were aſſaylled. They
were a .CCC. knyghtes and ſquyers / the Englyſſhe
men were ryght ioyful whē they were
in the hauen of Breſt / and vnderſtode howe ye
Bretons helde theyr baſtydes / and ſayd howe
they wolde go and ſe them and fyght with thē
for they had grete deſyre to doo ſome dedes of
armes.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Lancaſtre aſſayled
the lordes / knyghtes / & ſquyers / 
that were in the baſtydes before breſt
in Bretayne / and howe they defended
themſelfe. Ca. lxvii.
            
               THus the duke of Lancaſtre
and his company toke
lande a lytell beſyde the
caſtell of Breſt and lefte all
theyr horſes & prouyſyō ſtyl
in theyr ſhyppes / but all the
ladyes & damoyſelles toke
lande to refreſſhe them ye fyrſt day they dyd no
thynge but apparelled themſelfe to lodge on ye
erthe / for .ii. or .iii. dayes in pauylyons along
ye ſee ſyde / & ſo there they lay all yt day and that
nyght / & the nexte mornyng ye conſtable & marſhall
of the army ſowned theyr trompettes to
cauſe euery mā to be armed / & ſo they dyd & in
good ordre wente towarde ye caſtell to ye baſtydes
whiche were ſtrongely made in maner to
haue endured a .ix. or .x. yeres & aboute ye baſtides / 
there were dykes / gates / towres / & good
walles all made of grete tymbre / then the knyghtes
& ſquyers of Englonde ſuche as deſyred
dedes of armes came to the barryers of ye baſtides / 
& there begā to ſkyrmyſſhe wt feruent wyl
to wyn ye baſtydes / & the Bretons knyghtes / &

ſquyers that were within the baſtydes were
redy to defende them / and to the entente to fyght
more at large hande to hande / they dyd
put away the barryers of theyr defences wherin
they dyd grete foly / but they truſted to moche
in theyr owne chyualry / there was doone
many a goodly feate of armes / and herde rencountrynges / 
and ſore foynynge with ſperes / 
and they dyd beſt that had beſt breth / howbeit
there were many of ye Englyſſhmen / & therfore
they gaue the Bretons moche a do / and ſo by
clene force of armes the Englyſſhmen wanne
the baylles ſo yt within the cloſure of ye towne
there were mo then .C. men of armes ſo that ye
Bretons were at the poynte to haue loſt all / &
when ſyr Iohn̄ of Maleſtroyte & the vycount
of Combor ſawe the maner / then he cryed his
crye and ſayd what how ſyrs / ſhall we loſe all
thus / on forwarde in fyghtynge we ſholde not
faynte but outher dethe or honoure. Then the
bretons cloſed togyder with grete courage / &
pytched theyr ſperes and glayues in the erthe
and helde ſtrongly theyr place and fought couragyouſly / 
there were many fayre dedes of armes
done / ſo that by force the Englyſſhe men
were fayne to recule backe / for they were ſoo
wel reſyſted that they coulde gete no grounde
on them / ſo that they were clene beten out of ye
baylles / and ſo as on that day they coulde not
wyn it agayne. And at another corner of theyr
baſtydes they had a towre of ſtone deſcendynge
downe from a rocke / whiche the Bretons
helde to theyr aduaūtage for kepynge of theyr
baſtydes. Therat was made a grete aſſaulte
with archers and other in the meane ſeaſon
whyle the other men of armes were fyghtyng
at the barryers / and there the Englyſſhe men
paſſed ouer a lytell dyke that was there / and
ſo came to the foote of the towre wt pycke axes
and mattockes in theyr handes / and ſo began
to myne ſore ye towre / and ſuche as were with
in defended themſelfe & theyr towre valyauntly / 
but the Englyſſhe archers ſhotte ſoo hooly
togyder that none durſt appere at theyr defence
without they were ſore paueſſed / and ye Englyſſhe
men vndermyned ſo ſore the foundacyon
of the towre that it raue clene in ſondre / &
the one parte fel downe / and they yt were with
in when they ſawe it wolde fall / they drewe
them all in to the parte that ſtode. Then ye Englyſſhe
men made a grete ſhowte / and by that
tyme it was late / then they ſowned ye retrayte
for they ſayd they had done ynoughe for that
daye. So then the Englyſſhe men departed &
ſayd to the Bretons / ſyrs abyde there al nyght
and make good watche / for to morow we wyll
come / and loke on you agayne / ye ſe well ynoughe
what caſe ye be in / there is nothyng before
you to ſhadowe you from vs.
            THe entente of the Englyſſhe men was
the nexte daye to retourne agayne to
aſſayle the baſtydes / and to conquere them &
all ſuche as were within them / whiche was ryght
well in theyr puyſſaunce ſoo to haue done
So thus the Englyſſhe men paſſed the nyght
it is often tymes ſayd / moche thynges ſholde
fall of mennes thoughtes yf there were no coū
               tre
thoughtes there agaynſt / I ſay it bycauſe
thoughe there were in the Englyſſhe ooſt ſubtyll
and wyſe men of warre / yet the Bretons yt
were within the baſtydes were ſuffycyently
prouyded with wyſdome / and welconſydered
what thynge myght auayle them / & what thynge
was for theyr domage / they ſawe well they
muſt nedes departe thens / or elles to be taken
or ſlayne / then they determyned to truiſe that
they myght / and to departe and leue theyr baſtyde / 
as they ordeyned ſo they dyd / and lepte
on theyr horſes / and lefte theyr baſtydes & toke
the feldes / and ſo toke the way to Hambont
a .iiii. myle thens / they dyd wyſely therin / for
they feared no purſute of the Englyſſhe men / 
bycauſe theyr horſes were not a lande. Thus
ſyr Iohn̄ Maleſtroyte and his company rode
ye ſame nyght to Hānybout / they founde it opē
then they feared but lytell the Englyſſhe men
The nexte day the trompettes blewe and euery
man in the ooſt armed hym / and drewe towarde
the aſſaulte of the baſtyde. Then they
herde tydynges how the Bretons were departed
and had lefte the baſtyde voyde / then ye Englyſſhmen
repented them in that they had not
layde a buſſhment for them / wherby they ſholde
not haue loſt ſo theyr pray. Then they brake
downe the baſtyde & ſet fyre theron. Thus
by the duke of Lancaſtre ye baſtydes were rayſed
before Breſt / & the ſame day the duke & ſyr
Iohn̄ Holande & certayne other lordes wente
to ſe the caſtell of Breſt & the ladyes wt them &
there they ete a drāke & made chere & ſo wente
agayne to theyr lodgynges / & ye nexte day whiche
was ye .iii. day they refreſſhed theyr ſhyppes
wt freſſhe water & the .iiii. daye toke ſhyppynge
& ſo departed.
            THe fourthe day after the duke and his
company and the maryners toke counſayle
togyder whiche waye they ſholde drawe

and whether they ſholde take lande at Lyxbone
or at the porte of Portyngale / or in Byſquay / 
or at Coulongne / and longe they were
in counſayle or they were fully determyned / &
Alphons Vietat patron of the galeys of Portyngale
was ſente for to them / and ye queſtyon
was demaunded of hym / and he anſwered &
ſayd. Syrs for this cauſe I was ſente to you
out of Portyngale fro the kynge my mayſter
and ſyr knowe for trouthe that where ſoeuer
ye aryue in his countrey / ye ſhall be ryght welcome
to hym / & it ſhall be ryght ioyfull to hym
for gretely he deſyreth your comynge and to ſe
you. So thus the ſpace of an houre they were
at a poynte to haue landed at the porte of Portyngale
a .xxx. myle from Lyxbone / Howbeit
after they chaunged theyr purpoſe / for it was
ſayd amonge them that it were ferre more honourable
for them to lande in the marches of
theyr enemyes then in the lande of theyr frendes / 
ſaynge alſo that yf theyr enemyes knowe
yt they be landed on them they ſhal be the more
feared then they reſted to take lande at Coulongne
in Galyce / ye maryners ſet theyr courſe
that way / and had wynde and wether at wyll
and ſo after they departed fro Breſt ye .v. daye
they came to the hauen of Coulongne and taryed
for the fludde / wherfore they ſholde not
approche nere to the lande.
            NOwe ſhall I ſhewe you of the knyghtes
of Fraunce as the lorde of Barroys
ſyr Iohn̄ Braquemont / ſyr Iohn̄ of Caſtell
Morant / ſyr Peter of Bellames / ſyr Tryſtrā
and other that were come in pylgrymage to ye
towne of Compoſtella / where lyeth the body
of ſaynt Iames / and whē they had done theyr
pylgrymage / and offered / and were in theyr
lodgynges tydynges came to them howe the
Englyſſhe men were on that cooſt / and by lykelyhode
to aryue at Coulongne or they coulde
vntruſſe theyr harneys and diſcharge theyr
mules. Then they armed them quyckely / and
determyned to go thyder to defende the porte / 
caſtell and towne there / and ſuche as knewe ye
countrey ſayd ſyrs auaunce forwarde ſhortely
for yf the Englyſſhe men happen to wynne
the towne or Caſtell of Coulongne they wyll
be lordes of all the countrey aboute / theſe knyghtes
dyd ſuche dylygence that they came the
ſame nyght to the towne of Coulongne whiche
was a .xiiii. longe myles thens / and a coū
               trey
full wylde to laboure in. They came ſo to
the poynte that they entred in to ye towne and
Caſtell the ſame ſeaſon that the Englyſſhmen
came in to the hauen / & of theyr comynge they
of the towne and caſtell were ryght ioyfull / &
all that nyght came after them theyr caryages
and ſomers / and in the mornyng it was grete
beautye to beholde entrynge in to the hauen
ye galeys and ſhyppes charged with men and
prouyſyon / and to here the trompettes & claryons
ſounde / and the trompettes and claryons
of ye towne and caſtell dyd ſounde in lykewyſe
agaynſt them / thē ye Englyſſhe men knew wel
that men of warre were in the towne and Caſtel.
Then they yſſued out of theyr galeys and
ſhyppes in to ye feldes / not as then approchynge
the towne / for they ſawe well ye towne was
ſtronge and well prouyded of men of warre / &
without the towne there were certayne fiſſher
houſes. There ye Englyſſhe lordes made theyr
lodgynges / and ſoo laye ſtyll a .iiii. dayes doynge
none other thynge / but dyſchargynge of
theyr ſhyppes / they had ſo grete prouyſyon / &
theyr horſes were ſet a lande / whiche had ben
on ye ſee a .xv. dayes ſore oppreſſed what with
the furoure of the ſee / and with the nombre of
people in euery ſhyppe / yet they had ben well
kepte / and had haye / ootes / and freſſhe water
ſufficyent / whā euery thynge was voyded out
of the galeys and ſhyppes / then it was demaū
               ded
of ye duke what he wolde haue done with
his nauey / he anſwered and ſayd / I wyll that
al the maryners be payde of theyr wages / and
then let euery man do his owne profyte I gyue
them good leue / for I wyll that euery man
do knowe that I wyll neuer paſſe agayne the
ſee in to Englonde tyll I haue my full pleaſure
of the royalme of Caſtell / or elles I wyll
dye in the quarell / then ye maryners were payde
ſo that euery man was contente / and ſo departed
when they myght out of the hauen of
Coulongne / and ſome wente in to Portyngale / 
and ſome to Lyxbone / and ſome to Bayon
or to Albay in Bretaygne / or in to Englande
ſoo that none abode there behynde. Thus the
duke of Lancaſtre and his men lodged without
Coulongne in ſuche lytell houſes as they
founde there / and abrode in the feldes in bowers
made of grene bowes lyke men of warre.
            ABoute the ſpace of a moneth and more
the duke laye at Coulongne and remeued
not without it were a huntynge or a hawkynge / 
for ye duke & other lordes of Englande
had brought with them hawkes and houndes
for theyr ſporte / and ſparowe hawkes for the

ladyes. Alſo they brought with them in ye ſhyppes
mylles to grynde corne and ouyns to bake
in / theyr foragers wente dayly a foragynge
where as they thought to ſpede / howbeit they
founde no grete plenty of forage / for they were
lodged in a poore countrey and a deſerte / 
Wherfore they were dryuen to go ferre of for
forage. And alſo they of the garyſon of Coulongne
as ye barroys of barres who ryght wel
coulde take a vauntage of his enemyes if nede
were and his other companyons / When they
ſawe the Englyſſhe foragers ryde forthe ſo folyſſhly / 
they thought on a daye to be before thē
and to make them pay for all they had before / 
ſo on a daye they armed them a .CC. and rode
by guyde in the nyght aboute the woodes and
mountaynes / and ſo at the brekyng of the day
they came to a wood and to a mountayne called
the Eſpynet and there taryed / For it, was
ſhewed them howe the Englyſſhe foragers rode
abrode / & true it was to ye nombre of .iii.C.
And when theſe foragers had ben a brode a .ii.
dayes and gotten moche forage / then they retourned
towarde theyr ooſt / and theyr waye
laye to paſſe the pace of the pynet. Then they
of the buſſhment brake out on them and cryed
Barroys of barres. Then the foragers were
abaſſhed / for the mooſt parte of them were vnarmed / 
they had a ſyxe ſocore archers who dyd
put themſelfe in good ordre of defence / and began
to ſhote / and dyd hurte and wounde men
and horſes / and when theyr ſhot was paſt they
caſt away theyr bowes and fell to other defence
with ſuche wepons as they had / & ſome hyd
them to ſaue themſelfe / what ſholde I make
longe tale of theſe Englyſſhe foragers / there
were ſlayne a .C C. and the other ſaued themſelfe
as wel as they myght in buſſhes & hedges
where as horſmen coulde not come to them / &
ſuche as fled came to Coulongne & there ſhewed
how ye barroys of barres had ouerthrowen
them / then they of the ooſt began to ſtyre and
to arme them / & ſyr Thomas Moreaux marſhal
of the ooſt with a .CCCCC. mounted on
theyr horſes with the penon of ſaynt George &
ſet forth with grete deſyre to fynde the frenſſhe
men / and rode ſoo longe that they came to the
Eſpynet / and there they founde theyr men lyenge
deed / and no thynge elles / for the frenſſhe
men were departed / ſoo they retourned without
doynge of ony thyng elles / and when they
were wtin halfe a myle of theyr ooſt they ſawe
where the frenſſhmen entred in to theyr garyſon
of Coulongne / Wherwith they were ſore
dyſpleaſed / but they coulde not amende it / and
that day the marſhal was ſore blamed of ſome
of the ooſt in that he ſente forthe or ſuffered to
go forth ony foragers without ſure conduyte / 
conſyderynge theyr enemyes beynge lodged
ſo nere them in a ſure holde / and of ſuche nombre
able to ouerthrowe .v. or a .vi.C. foragers / 
the duke of Lancaſtre & the Conſtable ſo blamed
hym that he was ſore aſhamed therof / but
he excuſed hymſelfe & ſayd howe they had ben
forth more then .x. tymes before / & had no hurte
Well ſayd the duke take better hede another tyme / 
for a caſe may fall in an houre or in a daye
that peraduenture ſhall not fall agayne in an
hundreth dayes.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Lancaſtre & his
ooſt when they had ſoiourned a momoneth
at Coulongne / then they departed
& rode towarde ſaynt Iames
in Galyce. Ca. xlviii.
            
               ANd when the duke of
Lācaſtre had ſoiourned at
Coulongne ye ſpace of a moneth
and more / then he was
coūſayled to dyſlodge thēs
& to drawe towardes ſaynt
Iames in Galyce / where
was a better countrey and a more plentyfull
for men and horſes / ſo he departed and rode in
thre batayles. Fyrſt the marſhal with .CCC.
ſperes & .vi.C. archers. Then the duke with
.CCCC. ſpere and all the ladyes and damoyſelles
in his company / and in the arrere garde
the conſtable ſyr Iohn̄ Hollande wt a .CCCC
ſperes & .vii.C. archers. Thus they rode fayre
& eaſely in .iii. batayles / and were rydynge
thre dayes bytwene Coulongne and ſaynt Iames.
The countrey of Galyce was ſore afrayde
of the dukes comynge thyder / for they fered
gretely his puyſſaūce. The marſhall with his
vowarde came to Compoſtelia where ye body
of ſaynt Iames lyeth / and the towne was cloſed
agaynſt hym / howbeit there were no men
of warre there in garyſon / but men of ye towne
yt kepte it / for there were no frenſſhmen wolde
vndertake to kepe it to the vtteraunce / for it
was not ſtronge ynoughe to be kepte agaynſt
ſuche men of warre as the duke had brought
thyder. The marſhall of the ooſt ſente thyder
an heraulde of armes to knowe theyr ententes
what they wolde do / the heraulde came to the

barryers & there foūde ye capytayne of ytwarde
called Alphons of ſene / then the heraulde ſayd
ſyr capytayne here a lytel beſyde is the duke of
Lancaſtres marſhall who hath ſent me hyder &
he wolde gladly ſpeke with you. Wel ſayd yt capytayne / 
it pleſeth me wel / let hym come hyder
& we ſhal ſpeke wt hym / ye heraulde retourned &
ſhewed the marſhall as they ſayd / then ye marſhall
wt .xx. ſperes wt hym wente thyder & foūde
at the barryers ye capytayne & certayne of ye chefe
heedes of the towne / then ye marſhal lyghted

twyſe ſo ſtronge as is this towne / I ſhall ſhew

do yelde them to my lorde the duke and to my

haue good pledges and ſuffycyent / that is wel
ſayd ſayd the capytayne / we in lykewyſe wyll

Nay ſyr not ſo ſayd the marſhall. My lorde ye

therfore anſwere vs ſhortely what ye wyll

the marſhall / then the capytayne entred in to ye
towne and cauſed euery man to come before
hym. Then wyſely he ſhewed to them frome
poynte to poynte as ye haue harde before / and
fynally they agreed to receyue the duke and ye
duches peaſybly as theyr lorde & lady / and to
abyde in theyr towne as longe as it pleaſed
them without the puyſſaunce of kynge Iohn̄
dyd dryue them thens / and alſo that whē they
had taryed there as it pleaſed them a yere or

out of ye countrey without they lefte there
a ſuffycyent garyſon to defende them fro theyr
enemyes / elles they to rendre it agayne to kynge
Iohn̄ or to his marſhall yf they were / ſoo
commaunded / and ſo they to be quyte of theyr
fayth and promyſe then made. This treatye ye
marſhall ſyr Thomas Moreaur accepted &
ſayd how they ſayd as they ought to do & that
the duke and ye duches deſyred nothynge elles
of them. Then the marſhall retourned to his
men & ſo to the duke who taryed for hym in the
feldes / there he ſhewed ye duke this trety wher
wt the duke was content / & ſoo in good ordre
of batayle the duke rode to the towne of ſaynt
Iames.
            WIthin .ii. lytell frenſſhe myles of ſaynt
Iames in Galyce there came in proceſſyon

& they entred in to ye towne of ſaynt Iames
& the fyrſt voyage they made they wente to the

            ON the other ſyde it was ſayd in dyuers
places in fraunce / in haynalte / & in pycardy
yt ye frēſſhe armye yt was thus apparelled in
flauders was nother to go in to englande nor
to Calays / but rather to retourne al ye matter &
ſet on ye towne of Gaunte / & as it was enfourmed
ye towne of Gaunte y• ſame ſeaſon doubted
gretely yt all ye apparell was for to come on
thē / but they were in a wronge byleue / for ye duke
of Borgoyne theyr lorde wolde nothyng to
thē but good reſt & peas / thoughe yt Frauncis
Atreman were ſlayne anone after the makyng
of the peas at Tournay for of his deth ye duke
was nothyng to blame / nor the duke had none
euyll wyl to hym though in ye ſeaſon of war he
dyd many feates of armes for ye towne agaȳſt
the duke as it hath ben declared more playnly
here before / for though he came to an euyl ende
it was his owne defaulte / for if he had byleued
Peter du boys it had ben otherwyſe with hym
for when the peas was made bytwene ye duke
of Borgoyne & them of Gaunt / when he retourned
fro Tournay to Gaunt / & yt Peter du boys
made hym redy to go in to Englande with ſyr
Iohn̄ Bourſer / then Peter ſayd to hym / Fraū
               cis
what wyll ye do / wyl ye go in to Englande
with vs / then he ſayd he wolde abyde ſtyll in
Gaunt / why ſayd Peter thynke you to abyde
here in peas there is grete hatred agaynſt you
& me / I wyll abyde for nothynge here / it is not
to tryſt in ye comontye / ye haue herde how they
of Gaunt ſlue & murdred the valyaunt Iaques
of Artuell who had done ſo moche good to the
towne bothe in counſayle & in armes / & for a lytell
cauſe the vyllaynes ſlue hym / & the honeſt
men of the towne dyd not ſaue hym but rather
dyſſymuled & was glad of his dethe / in lykewyſe
Frauncis wyll they do with you & me yf
I abyde here / but as for me I wyll not tary / 
therfore adue. ¶Why ſayd Frauncis the duke
of Borgoyne hath pardoned all thynges / & hath
reteyned me yf I wyll to go with hym to be
as a ſquyer of his ſtable with .iiii. horſes / & he
& alſo ſyr Guy of Tremoyll ſheweth me grete
ſygne of loue. In the name of god ſayd Peter
du boys / I ſpeke not of my lorde ye duke of Borgoyne
nor of his knyghtes I thynke they wyll
kepe well the peas / but I ſpeke of the comons
of Gaunt / there be ſome yt ye haue not alwayes
pleaſed / remembre ye not of the lorde of Sargelles
whom ye made to be ſlayne & other / knowe
for trouth yt theſe paſſed hatredes wyl contynue
in theyr hartes / yf ye abyde amonge thē
yet it were better for you to go & dwell with ye
duke of Borgoyne. Well ſayd Frauncis I ſhal
take aduyſe / but in to Englande I wyl not go
Thus Frauncis Atreman abode ſtyll / & peterdu
boys wente with ſyr Iohn̄ Bourſer / & anone
after yt the peas was cryed & publyſſhed in
all the partyes of Flaunders / then there was
made a crye that none ſholde bere ony armure
or ſworde after hym / & Frauncis Atremā who
was ſtyll in Gaunt & had kepte a grete eſtate
the warre durynge / thought to contynue ſomwhat
his honeſtye / euer where he went he had
a .iii. or .iiii. ſeruauntes waytynge on hym armed
& beryng ſwordes & other wepons on thē
& when this crye was made in the dukes name
he thought it ſholde not rynne on hym nor none
of his ſeruauntes / he thought hymſelfe ſoo
well in fauoure with them of the towne / but he
was deceyued / for within a .vii. or .viii. dayes
after the cry was proclamed ye dukes baylyffe
came perſonally to hym & ſayd Fraūcis ye put
my lorde the dukes offycers in grete ſuſpecte / 
why do you go aboute in ye towne in harneys
& your ſeruauntes beryng ſwordes & wepons
of defence as thoughe it were in y• tyme of war
whiche pleaſeth not vs / Wherfore we cōmaunde
you in the dukes name to lay them downe / 
Frauncis who thought none euyll in yt he dyd
but to maynteyne his eſtate anſwered & ſayd / 
ſyr baylyffe I wyll obey as it is reaſon / and I
thanke god I hate no perſone nor wolde not yt
ony ſholde haue ony hurte for my ſake / howbe
it I had thought to haue had that aduaūtage

in ye towne of Gaunt yt I myght haue had my
ſeruaūtes were theyr ſwordes after me. Nay
ſayd the baylyffe not ſo / for ſuche of the towne
as ye haue done ſeruyce vnto ſpeke theragaynſte
& haue meruayle therof / & demaunde of me
why I do ſuffre it / they ſaye it ſemeth that I
wolde renewe agayne the olde warre / whiche
they wyll not ſuffre / Wherfore Fraūcis I pray
you do ſo that I here no more therof / for yf ye
wyll not obey I muſt repute you as an enemy
to my lorde the duke & to my lady of borgoyne
& ſo the baylyffe departed fro hym / & frauncis
wente to his lodgynge & cauſed his ſeruauntes
to lay downe all theyr armure / & ſo entred
in to ſuche a fantaſye that mooſt parte after he
wente in ye towne all alone or but one with hȳ
chylde or ſeruaunt. So it was on a daye there
was a feeſt kepte without the towne of Gaunt
in the abbey of ſaynt Peters / & Frauncis Atre
man wente thyder / and but one ſeruaunt with
hym without armure or wepyn / he was ſpyed
& pourſued with a baſtarde ſone of the lorde of
Harzelles whom he had cauſed to be ſlayne be
fore / wherfore thē his ſone thought to be reuenged
of his faders deth / this baſtarde was prouyded
for the matter / & pourſued Frauncis tyl
he came out of the towne & farre fro ony company
and cryed on hym and ſayd. A thou Frauncis
Atremā thou ſhalte dye / thou cauſed my fader
to be ſlayne / and I ſhall ſlee the / & as Fraū
               cis
tourned hym the baſtarde ſtrake hym on ye
heed with his ſworde ſo weyghty a ſtroke that
he claue his heed to the tethe / and ſo fell downe
deed to the erthe & the baſtarde wente his way
fayre and eaſely no man pourſued hym / ſo this
Frauncis Atreman was wel worthy to dye in
that he wolde not byleue Peter du Boys / and
when tydynges came in to englande & that Peter
du boys knew therof he toke but ſmal thought
for hym & ſayd / or I departed fro Graunt
I well aduyſed hym / let vs ſe nowe who wyll
amende it / not they that duryng the warre dyd
gretely honoure hym / for ſuche doubtes I byleued
ſyr Iohn̄ Bourſer & came in to englande
            NOwe let vs retourne to the prouiſyons
that were made at this ſeaſon at Dan &
at Sluſe / it is not had in remembraūce of mā
nor by wrytynge neuer none lyke ſene nor herde
of / Golde & ſyluer was no more ſpared then
thoughe it had rayned out of the clowdes / or
ſcomed out of ye ſee / the grete lordes of fraunce

kynge hymſelfe as yonge as he was had more
wyl to this iourney then ony other & that he alwayed
ſhewed to the ende therof / euery mā helped
to make prouyſyō for other & to garnyſſhe
theyr ſhyppes & to paynte them with theyr armes / 
paynters had as then a good ſeaſon / for
they wan & had what ſoeuer they deſyred & yet
there coulde not ynow be gotē for money / they
made baners penons ſtanderdes of ſylke ſoo
goodly yt it was meruayle to beholde thē / alſo
they paynted theyr maſtes of theyr ſhippes fro
the one ende to the other glyteryng with golde
& deuyſes & armes / & ſpecyally it was ſhewed
me yt the lorde Guy of tremoyle garnyſſhed
his ſhyp rychely / the payntynges yt were made
coſt more then .ii.M. frankes whatſoeuer ony
lorde coulde deuyſe for theyr pleaſure made in
ſhyppes / & the pore people of the royalme payde
for al / for the tallages were there ſo grete to
fournyſſhe this voyage / that they yt were moſt
ryche ſorewed for it / and the poore fled for it.
            ALl yt euer was done in Fraunce / in flaū
               ders
and other places / for this voyage
was wel knowen in Englande & it was made
moche gretter then it was in dede / wherof the
people in dyuers places of the royalme were
ſore abaſſhed / & there were made generall proceſſyons
in euery good towne & cyte by prelates
& men of the chyrche .iii. tymes euery weke
whiche were made in grete deuocyon with the
hartes with holy prayers & oryſons to god to
delyuer them fro y• peryll / howbeit there were
in englande a .C.M. that deſyred hartely that
ye frenſſhmen myght come & aryue in englande
& ſuche lyght companyons in comfortynge of
themſelfe & of them that were abaſſhed ſayd / 
let theſe frenſſhmen come / there ſhall not one
tayle of them retourne agayne in to fraunce / &
ſuche perſones as were in det & cared not for ye
payment therof were gretely reioyſed of ye comynge
of the frenſſhmen / & wolde ſay to theyr
credytours when they demaunded theyr det / 
ſyrs holde you ſtyll / they forge in Fraūce new
floreyns wherwith ye ſhall be payde / and in ye
truſt therof they lyued and ſpente largely and
whē they myght not be truſted they wolde ſay
what wolde ye haue of vs / It were better for
you that we ſholde ſpende frely the goodes of

fynde it & haue it / and ſo by that meanes there
was ſpente in outrage in Englande a .M. poū

of the dukes foragers as they paſſed

                wolde

and to Tyrry of Sonnayne / ſyrs
take your horſes & ryde aboute the towne & be
holde wel where we may beſt aſſayle ye towne
with leeſt hurtynge of our men / ſo they mounted
on theyr horſes & rode aboute the towne it
was of no grete crycute wherfore they retourned
agayne the ſoner & had wel aduyſed euery
place & ſo came to the marſhal & ſayd / ſyr in all
this towne there is but .ii. gates / ye one here be
fore you & the other ryght ouer agaynſt it / ſyr
we thynke theſe .ii. places are moſt eaſy for vs
to gyue ony aſſaulte / for rounde aboute ye towne
elles are grete dykes & depe ryght euyll to
go downe & worſe to mounte vp agayne / for
hedges & buſſhes of thorne yt growe therin / I
byleue it well ſayd the marſhal you ſyr Mauburne
ſhal haue a certayne cōpany wt you & go
to the other gate / & I ſhall abyde here and let
vs giue aſſaulte both at ones I wote not what
ſhal come to vs / but gladly I wolde ſe yonder
vyllaynes yt are lenynge on ye batylmentes of
the walles of theyr towne / they loke on vs to ſe
what we wyll do / they are lyke apes etynge of
peres & chyldren wolde take it fro them.
            OF ye marſhalles wordes his cōpany laughed
& loked vp to ye walles to beholde ye
vyllaynes / thē ſyr Maulburyne wente forth wt
his penō & with hym .C. ſperes & .iii.c. archers
& wente to ye gate & there taryed / ſo thē anone ye
aſſaulte bega in .ii. partes right ſharpe & fyers
& the mē within the towne were ouer ye gates &
threwe downe dartes ſo fyerſly yt it troubled ye
archers & croſbowes / but they hurte many of
thē with theyr ſhot bycauſe there were none at
the barriers to defende thē / for they were al cloſed
wtin the towne & defended thēſelfe wt ſhot &
caſt of dartes / ſo the engliſſhmē brake vp ye barryers
& came to ye gate / & bet & ruſſhed ſo therat
ye they made the gate to trymble & ſhake when
they wtin ſaw theyr gates lykely to be brokē vp
they went downe fro the walles in to ye ſtrete &
bare grete tymbre & wood to the gates / thē womē
chyldren & al maner of people bare ſtones &
fylled empty tonnes & pypes & ſet thē agaynſt

thē in lykewyſe one vpō another / & ſome were
ſtyll ouer the gates & dyd caſt downe grete barres

wtout he wolde be ſlayne / thus the vylaynes
of Ruel kepte theyr towne agaynſt ye Englyſſh

they ſent out theyr ſpyes to ſe where ye englyſſh
men were ſuche as were ſent forthe retourned
agayne & reported ſurely howe they were lodged
at the bace towne of ſenace / & yt by al ſymylytude
they wolde retourne agayne to ye aſſaulte
the nexte mornyng / thē they ſayd among thē
ſelfe / foly it was to begyn & more foly to contynewe / 
we can haue no blame though we yelde
vs to the duke of Lancaſtre or to his marſhall
for we haue defended our towne an hole daye
amonge ourſelfe without counſayle or comforte
of ony gentyll man or ony man of warre.

& at lengthe we cannot endure agaynſt them / 
Now ſyth they know the waye thyder & what
we can do it were better for vs to yelde then to
be ony more aſſayled / for if we be takē perforce
we ſhal leſe our bodyes & goodes / ſo they were
al of this opynyon yt yf the Englyſſhe men retourned
ye next day they wolde treate with thē

            THe Englyſſhmen in the mornynge retourned / 
anone vpon the ſone ryſynge

they retourned to theyr towne / & ſhewed howe
they had ſpoken with yt dukes marſhal / & how
they had made with hym ſuche a treaty yt they
ſholde be in ſaufegarde of theyr bodyes & goodes
excepte vytayles / then they of the towne
ſayd god graunt it ſo to be / thē they dyd rydde

yt they had ſet there / & opened the gate wyde / &
ſo came to the barryers with the keys in theyr

this towne & put you in poſſyſſyō therof on ſuche
cōdycyons as our men haue made reporte
to vs / on the ſame condycyon ſayd the marſhal
I receyue it / ſo he entred in to the towne / & he
& all his menlodged here & there at theyr pleaſure
& there taryed al a day / & or he departed he
ſayd to ſyr maulburyn / ſyr I delyuer you this
towne for you & your cōpany / ye ſhal haue here
a fayre garyſon / ſyr ſayd he yt is true / & I take
it wt a good wyll / for the garyſon pleaſeth me
well / then ſyr Maulburyn of Luners abode in
the garyſon of Ruelles in Galyce / & had vnder
hym a .lx. ſperes & a C. archers / & ſyr Thomas
moreaulx retourned to ye duke & to the duches
to ſaynt Iames.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Lancaſters marſhall
and his men aſſayled the towne
of Vyeclope in Galyce / whiche yelded
by cōpoſycyon / and of the ambaſſadours
that the duke ſente to the kynge
of Portyngale. Ca. li.
            
               ANone after yt the marſhal was retourned
fro the towne of Ruelles
on a daye he rode forthe agayne
with a .iii.C. ſperes & a .vi.C. archers / 
& ſo rode a lōge dayes iourney
came to a towne called Vyleclope whiche
was kepte but by ſuche villaynes as dwelte in
it / thē yt marſhal cauſed ye towne to be auewed
to ſe if it were pregnable or not & whē they had
wel aduyſed it they ſayd it myght be wel won
by aſſaulte / thē they lyghted on fote & ſēt theyr
horſes backe by theyr varlettes / and deuyded
themſelfe in .iiii. partes / and made themſelfe
redy lyke men of warre / ſyr Thomas Moreaulx
had the guydynge of one company / theſe
conde had ſyr yon Fythwaren / the thyrde ſyr
Iohn̄ Dambrychcourte / and the fourthe had
another knyght / and euery partye had foure
ſcore men of armes / and a .vii. ſcore archers.
Then they approched to the towne and wente
downe in to the dykes for therin was no water / 
and then mounted vp agayne on the other
ſyde well paueſſed / and the archers ſtode on y•
ſyde of the dyke / and ſhot ſo fyerſly that none
durſt appere at theyr defence / howbeit for all
theyr ſhot they within defended themſelfe valyauntly / 
for they were a grete nombre within
they caſt out dartes wt longe fethers & ſharpe
heddes ſo rudely yt who ſo euer was fully ſtryken
wt thē without they were well armed / they
were outher ſlayne or ſore hurte / howbeit knyghtes
& ſquyres to auaunce thēſelfe came to ye
fote of ye walles / for al ye ſtones yt fel on theyr baſenettes
& on theyr bodyes / & the .ii. ſquyers of
Haynalte Tyrrye and Gyllyā of Sonnayne
dyd dyuers goodly fetes of armes and made a
grete hole thrughe the wall with ſuche helpe
as they hadde / and 
                  •
               ought ſore hande to hande

with them within / and theſe .ii. bretherne wan
a .vii. dartes that were caſt at them / thrughe
y• hole they pulled them out of theyr enemyes
handes / theſe .ii. brotherne were vnder y• ſtandarde
of ye lorde Fyth waren / on ye other parte
ſyr Iohn̄ Dambrychcourte ſhewed valyauntnes
lyke a noble knyght / & he had at the foote
of the walle his penon pytched in the erthe by
hym / and he had a pykeaxe in his hande & myned
therwith to the beſt of his power to breke
the wall / it ought to be meruayled howe theſe
vylaynes were not abaſſhed to ſe themſefe ſoo
aſſayled on al partes / howbeit they coulde not
ſo longe endure / but that they had many handes
to defende themſelfe withal / but at the laſt
they aduyſed them (When they ſawe that the
aſſaulte ſeaſed not) to yelde themſelfe. Then ye
baylyffe of the towne who had cauſed them ſo
longe to contynue came and ſayd to the marſhall / 
ſyr cauſe your aſſaulte to ſeaſe / for ye men
of this towne wyll treate with you / well ſayd
the marſhall / I am contente. Then he cauſed
an heraulde to ryde aboute ye towne who ſayd
to euery man / ſyrs ſeaſe your aſſaulte tyl ye here
the marſhalles trompet blowe agayne to ye
aſſaulte / for he is in treaty with them of ye towne / 
and with thoſe wordes they ſeaſed & reſted
them / & ſome of them had nede therof / for they
were very wery with aſſaylynge. Then they
of the towne entred in to theyr treaty and ſayd
howe they wolde yelde themſelfe lyues & goodes
ſaued as they of other townes had done in
Galyce. Naye ſayd the marſhall ye ſhall not
ſcape ſo good chepe as other haue done / for ye
haue put vs in moche payne / and hurte dyuers
of our men / and we ſe clerely that ye can not
longe endure agaynſt vs / Wherfore it muſt be
houe you to bye your peaſe and our loue / or elles
we wyll retourne agayne to the aſſaulte / 
and wynne you perforce. Why ſyr ſayd ye baylyffe
what raunſome wyl ye aſke of vs / in goddes
name ſayd the marſhall .x.M. frankes / ye
aſke to grete a ſome ſyr ſayd ye baylyffe / I ſhal
yf it pleaſe you cauſe you to haue .ii.M. frankes / 
for ſyr this towne is but poore and hathe
ben ſore charged with taxes. Nay ſayd ye marſhal
we wyl not of yt / we wyl gyue you reſpyte
to take coūſayle togyder / for as for .iii. or .iiii.
M. frankes ye ſhall nor ſcape / for al is ours yf
we lyſt / and alſo I am blamed of my company
to make ony treaty with you. Therfore ſhortely
determyne you outher to do it or to leue it.
Then the baylyffe wente in to the towne and
called euery man before hym and ſayd. Syrs
what wyll ye do / if we ſuffre ony mo aſſaultes
the Englyſſhe men wyll conquere vs perforce
ſo we ſhall all dye & leſe al our goodes / they demaunded
of vs .x.M. frankes / & I haue offred
them .ii.M. I knowe well it is ouer lytell / for
they wyl neuer agree therto / therfore we muſt
exalte ye raunſome a .ii. or .iii.M. frankes more.
Then they of ye towne who doubted to loſe
all yt they had & theyr lyues alſo ſayd / baylyffe
forſake not to marchaundyſe with them / for rather
then we wyl be ony more aſſayled we wyl
pay .iiii.M. frankes / than ſayd the baylyffe / yt
is well ſayd / yet I wyll treate with them / then
he came agayne to the marſhall / and as I vnderſtande
theyr peaſe was made by paynge of
vi.M. frankes. Then the gates were ſet open
and euery man entred and were lodged where
they lyſt / and taryed there .ii. dayes / & the marſhall
delyuered the towne to yon Fythwaren
with .CC. ſperes and .CCCC. archers and
there he lay in garyſon more then .viii. monethes / 
but the raunſome of the towne wente to
the duke of Lancaſters profyte / & the marſhall
had a .M. frankes.
            ANd after that the towne of Vyleclope
was yelden vp to the dukes marſhall / 
then he retourned to ſaynt Iames to the duke
for the duke wolde haue hym aboute hym / and
ſometyme he rode to the fronters of Caſtell &
Spayne to gyue fere to the frenſſhe men / but
as longe as the Englyſſhemen kepte the felde
in Galyce there were none that came agaynſt
them / for the kynge of Caſtell was counſayled
not to ryde forth wt ony ooſt / but to kepe warre
by garyſons / and to abyde forſocours out of
Fraunce. Then ye duke of Lancaſtre was coū
               ſayled / 
and it was ſayd to hym / how yt it were
good that he and the kynge of Portyngale myght
ſpeke togyder / ſayenge alſo / ſyr the wrytynge
that rynneth thus bytwene you is good
but that is not ynoughe for the frenſſhe men be
ſubtyle and ſe ferther in theyr buſynes thē ony
other people / yf couertly they happen to make
a treaty with the kynge of Portyngale / & alſo
the kynge of Caſtell hathe aboute hym and of
his coūſayle dyuers lordes in Portyngale as
we be infourmed / & ſo peraduenture by theyr
meanes / they myght make a peaſe by mariage
or otherwyſe / ſo yt then by hym ye ſholde haue
noo comforte / what ſholde fall then / ye ſholde
be then in worſe caſe then euer ye were / for thē
the Caſtellyans wolde ſet lytell by vs / the Caſtellyans
are the mooſt ſubtyleſt people of the

worlde / trowe you yt the kynge of Portyngale
wolde not be contente to be at reſt of this buſynes
yf the kynge of Caſtell wolde ſuffre hym
to be kynge of Portyngale all his lyfe / and after
hym ye kyng of caſtel / ſyr it is to be doubted
thoughe he haue ſente for you / & ſo or ye coulde
tourne backe agayne we myght be ouerthrowen / 
and alſo ſyr ye know the ſtate of Englande
whiche hath as nowe ynoughe to doo to kepe

               o
the Portyngales and the Englyſſhmen rode
togyder ouer al the lande of Galyce they were
in no fere of ye Caſtellyans / for they were ferre
ynoughe ofrro them / and on the waye as they
rode ſyr Iohn̄ Dambrychcourre and Martyn
Ferrant of Merle fell in talkynge togyder / for
before that ſeaſon the ſquyer had ben in armes

            SO it fortuned a lytell before the batayle

and rode out of the caſtell a grete galop to come
to ye Caſtellyans who as then were drawen
in to a buſſhment / and had made one of theyr

ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant ſaw the geneture he ſayd to
a ſquyer of his / galop forth thy genet & aſſaye
to ſpeke with yonder geneture then the ſquyer
galopped forth and folowed hym nere euer lykely
to take hym / for he fled but ſoftely before
hym to ye entente to brynge hym in to ye buſſhment / 
& when he was nere them / the buſſhment
brake out at hym / & then he tourned quyckely

and ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant beynge vnder his
penon ſeynge his ſquyer retourned in ſuche

for he ſente me in to this countrey to gyue warnynge

               onte
then he made hym redy and departed thens at

& when we approched the batayles were raynged
in the feldes / the kynge of Caſtell on ye one

and at the fyrſt we knewe not whiche were Caſtellyans
and whiche were Portyngales tyll
at the laſt ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant Partelere ſayd I

Thus ſyr I haue ſhewed you howe he dyd me

            ANd of the comynge of theſe Englyſſhe
knyghtes ye kynge of Portyngale was
ryght ioyfull / & cōmaunded that they ſholde be
well lodged at theyr eaſe / and when they were

another tyme I wyll ſende them gretter

ſyr this is true ſayd the knyghtes of englande
then ſayd the kynge let it be done ſhortely / for
if the duke deſyre to ſe me / in lyke wyſe I deſyre

for then ye kyng charged his counſayle to agre

and the kynge who laye at the Porte

And ſo the duke was well welcomed home as
it was reaſon / and the duches demaunded of

by my fayth ſayd ye duke he is a gracyous man
& is of body and maners lyke to be a valyaunt
man / & I thynke he ſhall reygne in grete puyſſaunce / 
for he is well byloued of his mē / they

be it he reſted on Phylyp / he hath good reaſon
ſayd ye duches / for my doughter Katheryne is
yet to yonge for hym / thus the duke and the duches
paſſed that daye / and ſo ye tyme paſſed / for
wynter approched / howbeit in ye countreys of
Galyce & Portyngale there is but lytell wynter
for it is alwayes hote / & graynes & fruytes

fruytes rype in marche / benes / perſon & cheryes
& al freſſhe crbes groweth in February / & in ſo
me place they make wyne by mydſoner / & by yt
tyme harueſt is paſt.
            ANd thoughe yt the duke and ye duches
taryed in the towne of ſaynt Iames &
laye ſtyll / yet his men ſtyred abrode / & conquered
in the countrey of Galyce townes & caſtelles / 
& howe they were wonne I ſhall ſhewe you

therof infourmed both by knyghtes & ſquyers
as wel of englande as of Portyngale ſuche as
had ben preſent at all theyr conqueſtes & ſpecyally
by ye gentyl knyght of portyngale / or who
I haue ſpoken here before / who ryght amyably
at Myddelbourge in zelande as he came
fro his voyage out of Pruce enfourmed me / I
haue here before named the knyght / & yet agayne
I name hym / his name was ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant
Partelere / ſo it was ſyr Thomas Moreaulx
marſhall of the duke of Lancaſtres ooſt.
when the duke was retourned fro the fronters
of Portyngale & was come agayne to the towne

vnder the dukes obeyſaunce. And ſoo on a
day he departed fro ſaynt Iames with a .vi.C
ſperes / and .xii.C. archers / & toke the way to a
good towne in Galyce called Poceueyed / whiche
was rebell agaynſt them / they of the towne
had knowledge of ye englyſſhmennes comyng
for all the comon people fled out of theyr countrey
in to the good townes. So they toke coū
               ſayle
what they ſholde doo outher yelde or holde
as longe as they coulde endure / ſo they were
not all of one accorde / the comen people wolde
haue yelded / but the baylyffe who was 
                  〈◊〉
               
there by the kyng of Caſtel / and the rychemen
wolde not yelde ſo ſone / for they ſayd they ſholde
norher haue honoure nor profyte in theyr to

whē ye watche of ye towne ſowned & gaue knowledge

brake vp theyr counſayle & euery man went to
his defence / & ran to ye walles and bare barres / 
ſtones / dartes / Iauelyns / & ſhewed well howe
they wolde defende themſelfe and not yelde ſo
lyghtly.
            
               WHen the dukes marſhall and his company
were come before the towne of Ponceuayde / 
they lyghted on ſore and delyuered
theyr horſes to theyr varlettes / & then deuyded
theyr companyes to gyue aſſaulte / & the
archers araynged thēſelfe aboute the towne wt
theyr bowes redy to ſhote / and men of armes
well paueſſed and armed entrynge in to ye dykes / 
then the marſhalles trompettes ſowned
to the ſowte / and the men of armes then clame
vp the dykes with pykeaxes and mattockes to
wynne the walles / and the men of the towne wt

caſt downe ſtones & other thynges yt troubled
the mynours ſore and had done more and

the archers had not ben / but they ſhot ſo hooly
togyder that none durſt appere on the walles / 
and they dyd hurte many of them within and
ſpecyally the baylyffe of the towne was ſtrykē
with an arowe that perſed his baſenet and entred
in to his heed ſo yt he was fayne to be borne
out of the place to his lodgynge / yet ye euyll
people of ye towne wolde not yelde for all that
the baylyffe was ſore hurte / but were ye rather
more angry & more redy to defende them / thus
the ſaulte endured tyl it was nyght / then they
ſowned theyr retrayte / there were men hurte
on bothe partyes / the englyſſhmen rotourned
fro the ſaulte and wente to thery lodgynges / &
were of entency on ye nexte mornynge to retourne
to the ſaulte / & not to leue tyll they had gotten
it / the ſame nyght they of Ponce voyde toke
counſayle togyder and ſayd amonge themſelfe
we are but folyſſhe people thus to be hurte
and troubled for nothynge / why do we not
as Vylodes and they of Coulongne hath done
they are yelded to the duke of Lancaſtre / & to
my lady Cuſtaunce doughter to kynge Don
Peter let vs yelde lyke as other good townes
haue done / wherin they were wyſe for therby
they ſate in reſt / well ſayd other let vs do in lyke

let vs go to hym and here what he wyll ſay / for
certaynly to morowe the englyſſhmen wyl retourne
they wyl not let vs be in peas they wyl
outher haue vs perforce or by loue.
            TO that counſayle they all agreed and a
xii. of the beſt of the towne wente to the
baylyffes lodgynge whoſe name was Dyon
table of Lyon / & there they founde hym on his

to them that came to hym ſemblaūt of good

well thanked be god / for excepte your hurte we

lyeth our doubte / for we are ſure to haue a new
aſſaulte / and we be no mē of defence we are but

therfore we are come to haue your counſayle
what is beſt for vs to do / ye Englyſſhmen ſore
threteneth vs that yf we be taken perforce we
ſhall be put to the ſworde & leſe lyues and all yt
we haue in the name of god ſayd the baylyffe / 
ye can haue no

of the duches in lyke maner as they of Coulongne
be / ſo that no englyſſhmen come within ye
towne / but to ſende them prouyſyon out of the
towne for theyr money / thus do if ye can / I thȳ
               ke
they wyll be glad of the obeyſaunce / for they
haue many moo townes to wynne in Galyce / 
wherfore I thynke they wyll the lyghtlyer go

ſyth you counſayle vs to do it / ſo they were / determyned
on this purpoſe / and ſo paſſed y• nyght
as well as they myght / and in ye mornyng
at the ſone ryſynge they ordeyned certayne mē
to go out of the towne inſtructed and charged
what truce they ſholde make with the marſhal
yf they coulde / there were .vii. of them & they
came to the marſhall who was redy to retourne
to the ſaulte / and kneled downe ſalutynge
hym and ſayd / ſyr we be ſente hyder to you fro
them of the towne of Ponce voyde / who haue
commaunded vs to ſay in theyr names yt gladly
they wyll put themſelfe vnder ye obeyſaunce
of the duke of Lancaſtre and of my lady the duches
in maner & fourme as they of Coulongne
hath done / and as for prouyſyon ye ſhall haue
ynoughe out of the towne payenge courteyſly
therfore / and ſyr it is the entencyon of them
that hathe ſente vs hyder / that ye ſholde not
enforce thē ony further / nor you nor none other
to entre in to the towne with ony army / but yf
you & ſome of your company wyll entre ſymply / 
ye ſhall be welcome. The marſhall had an
englyſſhman by hym that vnderſtode the ſpeche
of Galyce / he ſhewed the marſhall in Englyſſhe
the wordes that they had ſpoken. The
marſhall anſwered and ſayd / ſyrs ſhortely retourne

to the barryers ſuche as ſente you hyder to
ſpeke there with me / I wyl gyue thē aſſuraūce
this day / and to morowe the ſone ryſyng without
we be agreed / ſo they departed and wente
to theyr towne and founde at the barryers the
mooſt parte of them of the towne / & there they
made relacyon of theyr meſſage ſayenge howe
incontynent the marſhall wolde come to ye barryers
to ſpeke with them / and yf ye be not company
ynowe ſende for ſuche mo as ye wyl haue
ſo then all the notableſt men of ye towne drewe
togyder / then the marſhall with a .xl. ſperes came
thyder and alyghted & came to ye barryers
and ſayd thus.
            
               
               YE ſyrs of Ponce voyde ye ſente to vs
.vii. of your men / and I byleue ſurely
ye dyd put your truſt in them and they
ſayd howe ye wolde gladly knowledge my lorde
the duke and my lady for your ſoueraynes
in maner and fourme as they of Coulongne hath
done / but ye wyl not haue none other gouernours
but your ſelfe within the towne / I pray
you what ſoueraynte ſholde they haue ouer
you without they had men ſet in the towne vnder
them elles when ye wyll ye wyll be vnder
hym and when ye lyſt forſake hym / ſurely it is
myne entencyon and al my company to ordeyne
you a good capytayne true & wyſe to gouer
you and to mynyſtre true Iuſtyce / and to put
out al offycers ſet there by the kynge of Caſtel
and yf ye wyll not do thus anſwere me / for we
are determyned what we wyll do / then they deſyred
a lytell to take counſayle togyder / and ſo
they dyd and then ſayd / ſyr we haue good truſt
in you / but we doubte theſe pyllers & robbers / 
for we haue ben ſore beten wt ſuche people in tyme
paſt / when ſyr Bettram of Cleſquy and the
bretons came fyrſt in to this countrey / for they
lifte vs nothynge / & therfore we fere / nay ſyrs
fere not that ſayd the marſhall / there ſhall noo
pyllers & robbers entre in to your towne / nor
ye ſhall leſe nothynge by vs / for we deſyre noo
thynge but obeyſaunce / and ſo with thoſe wordes
they were accorded / then the marſhall and
certayne of his men entred in to the towne and
the ooſt abode without in tentes and pauylyous / 
and there was ſent out of the towne to the
lordes .iiii. ſomers laded with good wyne and
as moche brede / polayne grete plenty / the marſhal
abode all yt day in the towne & ſet offycers
there for ye duke of Lācaſtre / and he made a capytayne
there a Galyſyan who had alwayes
ben in Englande with ye lady Cuſtaunce with
whom they of the towne were well contented / 
& the nexte day ye marſhall retourned to ye ooſt.
            THē he determined to go to another towne
a .vi. myles thens in Galyce called
Dyghos & ſo rode forth thyderwarde / & when
they were wtin .ii. myles they ſent a meſſagere
to ye towne to know whether they wolde rebel
or elles yelde thē as they of Ponce voyde haue
done yf not they ſholde be ſaulted ye nexte daye
they of Dyghos made no care for that meſſage
and ſayd we care for none aſſaulte we haue bē
aſſayled or this tyme & loſt nothynge whē that
anſwere was ſayd to the marſhall / he ſayd / by
ſaynt George and they ſhall be fyerſly aſſayled
are theſe vyllaynes ſo proude to gyue ſuche an

dyſlodged / and ſoo came before the towne & lyghted
a foote and ſet them in ordre to go to the

them & theyr towne / this towne was not
grete but it was ſtronge / and I byleue yf they
had had ony good mē of warre in theyr towne
the englyſſhmen had not ſo ſoone haue had thē

they were aſſayled & felte the arrowes of ye archers
of Englande & ſawe howe dyuers of thē

why doo we ſuffre ourſelfe thus to be ſlayne &
hurte for the kynge of Caſtell / it were as good
for vs to haue to our lorde the duke of Lancaſtre
ſyth he hath maryed the doughter of kyng
Don peter / as ye ſone of kyng Henry / we know
well yf we be taken perforce / we ſhall all dye / &
we ſe no comforte fro no parte / it is more then
a moneth ſyth we ſent to the kynge of Caſtel to
Burgus in Spayne / & there it was ſhewed to

of Fraūce / who are of his ſpecyall coūſayle
but they gaue hym counſayle to ſende noo garyſon

ſyrs retourne to your towne and do ye beſt you
can for yourſelfe / wherby we may well vnderſtande
that we nede not to ſuffre ourſelfe to be

of the towne came to the gate & mounted vp to
a wyndowe & made ſygne to ſpeke & to treate / 
they were herde & the marſhall came thyder &
demaunded what they wolde / they anſwered &
ſayd / ſyr marſhall cauſe your men to ſeaſe the

but I wyll ordeyne you a good capytayne
to defende you / and to counſayle you

in all your buſynes / then they anſwered & ſayd

ryght ioyful / then they rode forth towardes
Rybadane & had with them grete caryage and
moche prouyſyon & rode all in peas / there were
none yt ſtopped them of theyr way / for there
were no lordes of Galyce yt ſtyred / ſo they rode
tyll they came nereto the towne / & then lodged
them vnder ye olyues in a fayre playne within
halfe a legge of the towne / & there determyned
to ſende theyr heraulte to ſpeke wt them of Rybadane / 
ye marſhall had well herde howe they

began to mounte agayne with targes and pauaiſes
ouer theyr heedes for defence of ſtones

counſayle drewe to the kyng to here what
tydynges the kyng brought in that troublous
ſeaſon / when the kynge of Armony was come
in to the kynges preſence he made his ſalutacyon
and then began his proceſſe on the ſtate
howe he was come out of Fraunce pryncypally
to ſe the kynge of Englande whome he had
neuer ſene before and ſayd howe he was ryght
ioyous to be in his preſence truſtynge that ſome
goodnes ſholde come therby / and there he
ſhewed by his wordes that to withſtande the
grete peſtylence yt was lykely to be in englande
therfore he was come of his owne good wyl
to do ſome good therin if he myght / not ſent fro
the frenſſhe kynge wyllynge to ſet ſome accorde
and peas bytwene ye.ii. royalmes englande
and fraunce / many fayre pleſaunt wordes the
kynge of Armony ſpake to yt kynge of Englande
and to his counſayle / then he was ſhortly anſwered
thus / ſyr kyng ye be welcome in to this
royalme / for the kynge our ſouerayne lorde &
all we are glad to ſe you here / but ſyr we ſaye yt
the kynge hath not here all his counſayle / but
ſhortely they ſhall be here / and then ye ſhall be
anſwered / the kynge of Armony was contente
therwith and ſo retourned to his lodgynge / wt
in .iiii. dayes after the kynge was counſayled / 
& I thynke he had ſente to his vncles to knowe
theyr ententes / but they were not preſent at the
anſwere gyuynge / to go to the palays of Weſtmynſtre
and his counſayle with hym ſuche as
were aboute hym / and to ſende for the kynge of
Armony to come thyder / and when he was come
in to the preſence of the kynge of Englande
and his counſayle / the kynge ſate downe and
the kynge of Armony by hym / and then the prelates
and other of his counſayle / there ye kynge
of Armony reherſed agayne his requeites yt he
made / and alſo ſhewed wyſely howe all cryſtē
               dome
was ſore decayed and feblyſſhed by occaſyon
of the warres bytwene Englande & Fraū
               ce / 
and howe that al the knyghtes and ſquyers
of bothe royalmes entended to nothynge elles
but alwayes to be on ye one parte or of ye other
Wherby the empyre of Conſtantynoble leſeth
and is lyke to leſe / for before this warre ye knyghtes
and ſquyers were wonte to aduenture
themſelfe / & alſo the kynge of Armony ſhewed
yt by occaſyon of this war he had loſt his royalme
of Armony / wherfore he deſyred for goddes
ſake that there myght be ſome treatye of peas
had bytwene the .ii. royalmes of Englande &
Fraunce. To theſe wordes anſwered the archebyſſhop
of Cauntorbury for he had charge
ſo to do / and he ſayd / ſyr kynge of Armony it is
not the maner nor neuer was ſene bytwene .ii.
ſuche enemyes as the kynge of Englande and
the Frenſſhe kynge yt the kynge my souerayne
lorde ſholde be requyred of peas / and to entre
his landes with a puyſſaunt army / Wherfore
ſyr we ſay to you yt yf it pleaſe you ye maye retourne

to the Frenſſhe kynge / and cauſe hym
and all his puyſſaunce to retourne backe in to
theyr owne countreys / and when euery man is
at home / then yf it pleaſe you ye maye retourne
agayne hyder / and then we ſhall gladly entende
to your treatye. This was all the anſwere
the kynge of Armony coulde gete there / and
ſo he dyned with the kynge of Englande and
hadde as grete honoure as coulde be deuyſed / 
and the kynge offered hym many grete gyftes
of golde and ſyluer / but he wolde take noone
though he had nede therof but alonely a rynge
to the value of a .C. frankes. After dyner he toke
his leue and retourned vnto his lodgynge / 
and the nexte daye departed / and was in two
dayes at Douer / and there toke his leue of ſuche
lordes as were there / and ſo toke the ſee in
a paſſagere and aryued at Calays / & fro thens
wente to Sluſe / and there he ſpake with the
frenſſhe kynge / and with his vncles / and ſhewed
them howe he hadde ben in Englande and
what anſwere he had. The frenſſhe kynge and
his vncles toke no regarde to his ſayenge / but
ſente hym agayne backe in to fraunce / for theyr
full entencyon was to entre in to Englande as
ſoone as they myght haue wynde and wether / 
And the duke of Berre and the conſtable came
to them / the wynde was ſore contrary to them
for therwith they coulde neuer entre in to Englande / 
but the wynde was good to goo in to
Scotlande.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Berre departed
from Parys to come to Sluſe / 
and howe the conſtable of Fraunce
toke the ſee / and of the wynde
that was cōtrary to hym. Ca. lviii
            
               THus the duke of Berre
herde maſſe in our Lady
chyrche in Parys / and there
toke his leue / & ſayd how
he wolde neuer entre there
agayne tyll he hadde ben in
Englande / howbeit for all
his wordes he thought the contrary / for he had
no deſyre therto / for the wynter ſeaſon was ſore
come on and all the waye as he came he had
letters fro the kynge and fro the duke of Borgoyne
in haſtynge of hym / certefyenge hym
howe they taryed for noo thynge elles but for
his comynge. Soo the duke of Berre rode alwayes
forwarde / but it was but by ſmall iourneys.
¶And the conſtable of Fraunce departed
fro the cyte of Lentryngyet ſtandynge on
the ſee ſyde in Bretayne / with grete nombre of
men of armes and prouyſon / he had a .lxxii.
ſhyppes / and with hym he hadde the cloſure of
the felde made of tymbre / the conſtable and his
company had good wynde at the begynnynge
but when they approched nere to Englande / 
the wynde roſe fyerſe and grete / and at the entre
of margate at Tames mouthe / the wynde
was ſoo grete that whether they wolde or not
theyr ſhyppes departed ſoo that .xx. abode not
togyder / and ſome were dryuen perforce into
Tames / and there were taken by the englyſſh
men / and ſpecyally there was taken .iii. or. iiii
ſhyppes laden with parte of the cloſure of tymbre
ordeyned to cloſe in the felde / and certayne
mayſters carpenters and artficers with them
and ſo they were brought to London / wherof
the kynge had grete ioye / and ſo hadde all the
Londonners / and .vii. of the conſtables ſhyppes
were dryuen with the wynde with all the
prouyſyon and taken in zelande / and the conſtable
and other lordes with grete payne came
to Sluſe to the frenſſhe kynge.
            OF the conſtables comynge and his company
the frenſſhe kynge was ryght ioyfull / 
and the kynge ſayd to hym. ¶Syr conſtable
when ſhall we departe / certaynly we haue
grete deſyre to ſe Englande / wherfore I praye
you auaunce forth all our buſynes in haſty maner / 
and let vs entre in to the ſee ſhortely / myne
vncle the duke of Berre wyll be here with vs
within theſe two dayes / he is at Lyſle. Syr
ſayd the conſtable we can not departe tyll the
wynde ſerue vs / for ye wynde is so ſore agaynſt
vs and ſoo ſtraynable that the maryners ſaye
they haue herde none ſuche of a grete ſeaſon before / 
Conſtable ſayd the kynge I haue ben in
my veſſell and it pleaſeth me gretely the ayre
of the ſee / I byleue I ſhall be a good maryner / 
for the ſee dyd me no hurte / in the name of god
ſayd the conſtable / it hath done hurte to me / for
ſyr we were in grete peryll comynge fro Brytayne
hyder / the kynge demaunded hywe ſoo / 
Then the conſtable ſayd / by fortune of the ſee
and grete wyndes that roſe agaynſt vs in the
fronters of Englande / and ſyr we haue loſt of
our ſhyppes and men wherof I am ryght ſory

yf I myght amende it / but ſyr it is without remedy
for this tyme. Thus the kynge and the
Conſtable deuyſed togyder in wordes / and alwayes
the tyme paſſed / and the wynter approched / 
and the lordes laye there in grete colde
and peryll.
            THe flemynges gladly wolde not haue
hadde them retourne agayne thrughe
theyr countrey and they ſayd one to another / 
why the deuyll dothe not the frenſſhe kynge
paſſe ouer in to Englande / why taryeth he ſo
longe in this countrey / are we not in pouertye
ynoughe thoughe the frenſſhe men make
vs no poorer / we thynke they wyll not paſſe in
to Englande this yere / for the royalme of Englande
is not ſo eaſy to be wonne / englyſſhmē
be not of the condycyon of frenſſhemen / what
wyl they do in Englande / when ye englyſſhmē
were in Fraunce & ouer rode theyr countreys / 
thē they hyd themſelfe in theyr fortreſſes & fled
before them as the larke dothe before ye hawke
and in the towne of Bruges where as mooſt reſorte
was of the frenſſhmen they murmured &
were redy for waggyng of a ryſſhe to make debate
and ſtryfe / and al began by the frenſſhe lakeys / 
who had beten and hurte ſome of the flemynges / 
ſo that yf the honeſt men of the towne
had not armed them and drawen in to the market
place to appeaſe the ryot / there had not a
lorde knyght nor ſquyer of Fraunce haue ſcaped
vnſlayne / for the comon people of the towne
bare a grudge in theyr myndes for the batayle
of Roſebeque where theyr faders br
                  •
               ther
ne and frendes were ſlayne by the frenſſhmen
god ſent thyder at that tyme for the frenſſhmen
the lorde of Guyſtell who as then was at Bruges / 
when he vnderſtode howe ye comons wente
to harneys / he fered all ſholde be loſt without
remedy / howbeit he lepte on his hors with
v. or .vi. with hym and rode into the ſtretes / &
as he met with ony armed goynge to the marget
place warde he ſayd to them / ſyrs whether
goo you / wyll you loſe yourſelfe / haue ye not
had warre youghe / ſo that ye haue moche a do
to gete your lyuynge / retourne in to your houſes
there is nothynge to do / ye may put yourſelfe
and your towne in ſuche ieoperdy that all
ſhall be loſt / do you not knowe how the frenſſh
kynge and all his puyſſaunce and armye is here
in this countrey / ſoo with fayre wordes he
appeaſed theym and cauſed theym to retourne
in to theyr houſes / whiche hadde not ſo lyghtly
haue ben done / yf he had not ben there / the
frenſſhmen there were in ſuche fere that they
cloſed themſelfe in theyr lodgynges there to
abyde theyr aduenture.
         
         
            ¶Howe the voyage in to Englande
was broken by reaſon of the
wyndes & of wynter and by counſayle
of the duke of Berre. Ca. lix.
            
               SO fynally the duke of
Berre came to Sluſe to the
kynge / and the kynge ſayd to
hym / a fayre vncle how gretely
I haue deſyred to ſe you / 
why haue you taryed ſo long
we had ben as nowe in Englande
and fought with our enemyes if ye had
ben come / the duke began to ſmyle and to exſcuſe
hymſelfe / and ſhewed not incontynent what
laye in his harte / fyrſt he thought he wolde ſe
what prouyſyon and ordenaunce was made.
and to ſe the nauey that was named ſo goodly
Soo they were there a .vii. dayes that euery
daye it was ſayd we ſhall departe to morowe / 
howbeit ſurely the wynde was ſoo contrary
that in no wyſe they coulde ſayle in to Englande / 
wynter was well on / it was paſt ſaynt Andrewes
tyde / it was no good ſeaſon for ſo many
noble men to take the ſee / and many of theyr
ſhyppes were redy croſſed in a redynes to departe / 
ſome were in theyr ſhyppes to be the formoſt
ſholde paſſe / as ſyr Robert / and ſyr Phylyp
Artoys / ſyr Henry of bare / ſyr Peter of Nauare
and dyuers other. Then the kynges coū
               tayle
drewe togyder to ſe howe they ſholde perceyuer
in theyr iourney / but the duke of Berre
brake all and ſhewed ſo many reaſons reaſonable
that ſuche as had mooſt deſyre to goo were
gretely dyſcouraged / he ſayd it was a grete foly
to counſayle the frenſſhe kynge who in a maner
was but a chylde to take the ſee in that ſeaſon
of the yere / and to go fyght with ſuche people
as we knowe not theyr condycyon / nor the
way thyder / and as it is ſayd it is an euyll coū
               trey
to make warre in / for thoughe we were al
there a lande yet they wolde not fyght with vs
but when they lyſt / and we dare not then leue
our prouyſyon behynde vs / for yf we do it wyl
be loſt / and they that wyl make ſuche a voyage
ſo ferre of hath nede to begyn in the harte of ye
yere and not in wynter / call all the maryners
togyder and loke yf they wyl not ſaye that my

wordes be good / for thoughe we be as nowe a
thouſande and .v. hundred ſhyppes / yet or we
come there we ſhal not be .iii. hundred / then be
holde what peryll we ſholde put ourſelfe in / I
ſaye it not bycauſe I wolde haue the iourney
lefte / but I ſpeke it by waye of counſayle / and
ſyth that the mooſt parte of the royalme enclyneth
to this iourney / therfore fayre broder of
Borgoyne I wolde that you and I ſholde go
but I wolde not counſayle that the kynge ſholde
goo for yf ony myſfortune ſholde fall it ſhal
be layde to vs / well ſayd ye frenſſhe kynge who
was preſent at all thoſe wordes / yf none wyll
go I wyll go. Then the lordes began to ſmyle
and ſayd / the kynge hath a couragyous wyll / 
Howbeit they toke counſayle to deferre that
voyage tyll Aprell or May nexte after / & theyr
prouyſyons as Byſquet / powdred fleſſhe / and
wyne ſholde be kepte ſaufely tyll then / and there
they ordeyned that the lordes and theyr companyes
ſholde retourne thyder agayne in the
moneth of Marche / anone this was knowen / 
and ſo brake the voyage for that ſeaſon / ye whicoſt
the royalme of Fraunce a .C.M. frankes
xxx. tyme tolde.
         
         
            ¶Howe kynge Charles of fraunce
and the frenſſhe lordes retourned
euyll contente fro Sluſe and
out of Flaunders where as theyr
prouyſyons were made / to haue
gone in to the royalme of Englande / 
and of the feeſt that was made
at London. Ca. lx.
            
               AS ye haue herde before / 
there was made a grete
apparell in Fraunce by the
kynge there / and the lordes
with grete coſt and charge
with ſhyppes and galayes
to paſſe the ſee in to englande
to make warre there. And howe this voyage
was broken by wether / and bycauſe yt wynter
was ſo nere hande. Then it was ordeyned
by the counſayle that the kynge and the lordes
ſholde retourne euery man to his owne home / 
and euery thynge to abyde in the ſame ſtate vnto
the moneth of Marche or Aprell / and then
euery man to be redy at the kynges commaundement.
            THen there myght well haue ben ſeene
lordes and knyghtes ſoore dyſpleaſed
And ſpecyally ſuche as were of farre coūtreys
and had ſore trauayled theyr bodyes and ſpente
theyr money in truſt to haue had a good ſeaſon / 
as the erle of Sauoy / the erle of Army
                  •
               ake / 
and the erle Daulphyn of Awuergne and a
C. other grete lordes that departed in grete
dyſpleaſure bycauſe they had not ben in Englande / 
in lykewyſe ſo dyd the frenſſhe kynge
but as thenne he coulde not amende it. ¶So
thus departed all maner of people / ſome mery
and ſome gretely dyſpleaſed and angry / and
the offycers abode ſtyll there behynde / for too
make ſhyfte to ſell theyr prouyſyons for theyr
mayſters profyte and to take money for them
yf they myght / but they wyſt not to whome nor
where / for it that coſte a hundred frankes was
ſolde for .x. frankes and for leſſe money. The
erle Dalphyn of Awuergne ſayd vnto me that
by his faythe he hadde there prouyſyons the
whiche coſte hym ten thouſande frankes / and
when he retourned homewarde agayne he loſt
all togyther / and ſoo ſayd many knyghtes and
ſquyers and other people of Fraunce. ¶And
when theſe tydynges were knowen in the royme
of Englande / ſome were ryght ioyfull and
gladde therof as ſuche people that doubted the
Frenſſhe mennes commynge. And ſome were
angry and dyſpleaſed therwith / whiche was
ſuche people as thought to haue ſome promocyon
and profyte by them.
            
               SO thenne there was made at the cyte of
London a grete feeſt / and thyther came
all the lordes ſuche as hadde kepte the
portes and paſſages of the royalme of
Englande. ¶And then the kynge helde alſo a
noble feeſt at weſtmynſtre on Cryſtmaſſe day
And there were thre dukes made. ¶Fyrſte the
erle of Cambrydge was made the duke of yorke.
The erle of Buckyngham his broder was
made duke of Gloceſtre. And the thyrde was
the erle of Oxenforde and he was made the d
                  •
               
of Irelande / This feeſt endured with grete
reuelles and tryumphes. ¶So thus the people

of the royalme of Englande (as they thought
themſelfe) that they hadde eſcaped a grete
peryll / and thenne dyuers of them ſayd amonge
themſelfe that they wolde neuer ſette more
by the Frenſſhe men / and they thought that
all the aſſemble of the Frenſſhe men that was
made at Sluſe was but to fere the Englyſſhe
men / and to haue cauſed the duke of Lancaſtre
and his company to retourne agayne out of
Spayne.
         
         
            ¶Howe a ſquyer called Iaques
le Grys was accuſed in the parlyament
houſe at Parys before
all the lordes there preſent / by a
knyght called Iohn̄ of Carongne / 
and what Iugement was
gyuen vpon them / and howe
they Iuſted at vtteraunce in Parys / 
in a place called ſaynt Katheryne
behynde the temple. And
howe Iaques le Grys was confounded.
Ca. lxi.
            
               IN this tyme grete brute
there was in fraunce and
in the lowe marches of a feate
of armes that ſholde be
done at Parys in vtteraunce / 
for ſoo the matter was
Iudged in the parlyament
chambre at Parys. The whiche plee hadde endured
a yere bytwene theſe two partyes / the
one was aſquyer called Iaques le Grys / and
the other partye was a knyght called Iohn̄ of
Carongne / and they were bothe of the lande
& houſholde of the erle Peter of alanſon / & they
were welbyloued of theyr lorde / and ſpecyally
this ſquyer Iaques le Grys was byloued and
tryſted with his lorde aboue ony other perſone
in his courte or houſholde / and bycauſe that
mortall batayle folowed bytwene them / and
they beynge bothe of one lordes houſholde / 
euery man hadde grete meruayle therof. Soo
that out of dyuers countreys grete multytude
of people came to Parys at the daye of batayle
for to ſe it / I ſhall ſhewe you the hole matter
I as was then enfourmed.
            SOo it was that on a ſeaſon this knyght
called Iohn̄ of Carongne toke an
entrepryſe vpon hym to goo ouer the
ſee for the auauncement of his honoure / where
vnto he hadde ben longe tyme to accomplyſſhe
¶Soo he departed from his lorde the erle of
Alanſon to doo his voyage. And alſo he toke
his leue of his wyfe / who as then was reputed
a fayre lady and a yonge / and he lefte her in a
caſtell of his owne on the marches of Perche / 
otherwyſe called Argentuell / and ſo entred in
to his voyage / and his wyfe laye ſtyll at her caſtell
in a wyſe and ſage maner.
            ¶Soo here beganne the matter by the deuylles
temptacyon whiche entred in to the body
of the ſquyer Iaques le Grys / who was with
the erle of Alanſon his lorde / for he was as one
of his counſayle. And ſo he determyned in his
mynde to doo an euyll dede whiche he derely
bought afterwarde. Howbeit the euyll that he
dyd coulde neuer be proued in hym / nor he wolde
neuer confeſſe it: This ſquyer Iaques le
Grys ſette his mynde on the wyfe of the foreſayd
knyght Iohn̄ of Carongne in the abſence
of her huſbande / and he knewe well that ſhe
was in the caſtell of Argentuell but with her
owne company and houſholde ſeruauntes.
            ¶And ſoo on a mornynge he toke a good hors
and departed from Alanſon and ſo rode on the
ſpurres with grete haſte tyll he came to the ladyes
caſtell / and when he was thyder come the
ladyes ſeruauntes made hym good chere bycauſe
theyr mayſter and he were companyons
and felowes togyder / and ſerued bothe one lorde
and mayſter / and as for the lady ſhe thought
none euyll in hym for ſhe knewe nothynge
of his entente / nor wherfore he was come thyther / 
Howbeit ſwetely ſhe receyued hym / and
ledde hym in to her chambre / and ſhewed hym
parte of her buſynes: Then this ſquyer Faques
le Grys to accomplyſſhe his folyſſhe appetyte
deſyred the lady that he myghte ſe the
dongeon / for he ſayd it was a grete parte of
his comynge thyder to ſe it. The lady lyghtly
graunted hym his deſyre / and ſoo ſhe and he
wente thyder all alone / and nother chamberer
nor varlet entred with them / for the lady had
noo myſtruſt in hym of ony dyſhonoure / and
as ſone as they were entred in to the dongeon
Iaques le Grys cloſed the doore after theym.

The lady knewe not therof / for ſhe wente on
before / and thought that the wynde had ſhotte
the dore and ſo when they were togyder thus
alone Iaques toke the lady in his armes and
enbraced her / and dyſcouered to her his entent
The lady was ſore abaſſhed and wolde gladly
haue gone to the dore / but ſhe coulde not for
he was a bygge man / and ſo layde her downe
on the carpe
                  •
                and ſo by force dyd his pleaſure
with her and when he had done what he lyſt
he opened the dore and ſo departed / and the lady
ſore dyſpleaſed and abaſſhed of yt aduēcure

                  〈…〉
                alone in the donteonbut at the knyghtes
departed ſhe ſayd wypynge / Iaket Iaket
ye haue not well done thus to ſhame me / 
but the blame ſhall not reſt on me / but on you
yf god ſuffre my huſbande ones to retourne
home agayne. Soo Iaket toke his horſe and
departed and rode agayne to his mayſter the
erle o
                  •
                Alanſon and was there at his ryſynge
aboute .ix. of the clocke and at .iiii. of ye clocke
mo
                  •
               e mornynge he was ſene there before / I
ſhall ſhewe you why I ſpeke theſe wordes bycauſe
of the grete plee that folowed after / for ye
comyſſaryes of the parly ament of Parys had
the matter in eramynacyon. Thus the lady of
Carongne abode ſtyl in her caſtel after this ſorowfull
deed was done to her / and dyſcouered
the matter to no creature / but kepte her ſorowe
as ſecrete as ſhe myght for ſhe ſawe wel to ſpeke
as then therof the myght haue more blame
then honoure / but ſhe remembred well the day
houre and tyme that the dede was doone / and
ſoo after the tyme came that the lorde of Caroagne
came home from his voyage / the lady
his wyfe made hym good chere / the day paſſed
and the nyght came / and the knyght wente to
bedde and the lady wolde not / wherof the knyght
had grete meruayle and often deſyred her
to come to bedde and euer ſhe bleſſyd her and
walked vp and downe the chambre ſtudyenge
and muſynge fynally when all her ſeruauntes
were gone to bedde / then ſhe came to her huſbande
and fell downe on her knees and lamentably
ſhewed hym all her aduenture / the knyght
coulde not byleue her. Howbeit the lady

                  〈◊〉
                ſoo moche that he agreed well that it was

                that it was true ſo that night
paſſed. The nexte daye the knyght wrote many
letters and ſente them to all his wyffes frendes / 
and alſo to his owne / ſoo that in a ſhorte
tyme they were all come and aſſembled togyder
at the caſtell of Argentuell / and when they
were all in a chambre / then he began to ſhewe
them the cauſe why he hadde ſent for them / and
there made his wyfe to ſhewe them all the matter
fro poynte to poynte / wherof they all hadde
grete meruayle / ſo there he demaunded of thē
counſayle / and he was counſayled that he ſholde
drawe to his lorde the erle of Alanſon and
ſhewe hym all the matter / and ſoo he dyd / and
the erle who gretely loued this foreſayd Iaques
le Grys wolde not byleue hym / and ſoo
gaue daye to the partyes to be before hym at a
day lymytted. And alſo he commaunded that
the lady that hadde appeched Iaques le Grys
ſholde be there preſente for to ſhewe the more
playnly the trouthe of the matter / and ſoo ſhe
was with a grete nombre of her lygnage / ſoo
the pletynge was grete and longe in the erles
preſence. And Iaques le Grys was accuſed of
his dede by the knyght the lorde of Carongne
by relacyon of his wyfe who ſhewed there the
caſe as it was fallen / Iaques le Grys exſcuſed
hymſelfe ſayenge howe he was not gylty therin / 
and the lady layde it ſore to his charge / and
he euer denyed it / and hadde meruayle by his
wordes why the lady dyd hate hym / he proued
by them of the erle of Alanſons houſe that the
ſame daye at foure of the clocke in the mornynge
he was ſene there in his mayſters caſtell / 
and his mayſter ſayd and affyrmed that at .ix.
of the clocke he was with hym at his vp ryſynge / 
wherfore the erle ſayd it was not poſſyble
for hym to go and come and to do that dede in
foure houres and an halfe to ryde .xxiii. myles
wherfore the erle ſayd to the lady howe ſhe dyd
but dreame it / wherfore he wolde maynteyne
his ſquyer and commaunded the lady to ſpeke
noo more of the matter. But the knyght who
was of grete courage / and well truſted and by
leued his wyfe wolde not agree to that oppenyon / 
but ſoo wente to Parys / and ſhewed the
matter there at the parlyament / and there appeled
Iaques le Grys who appered and anſwered
to his appele and there layde in pledges
to accomplyſſhe the ordenaunce of the parlyament.
            THe plee bytwene them endured more
then a yere and an halfe / and they coulde
not be agreed / for the foreſayd knyght helde

hymſelfe ſore of the informacyon of his wyfe
and bycauſe the matter was ſo ſore publyſſhed
abrode he ſayd he wolde maynteyne his quarell
to the dethe / wherwith the erle of Alanſon
was ſore dyſpleaſed with the poore knyght / &
often tymes wolde haue had hym ſlayne / but
that the matter was in the parlyament / ſo longe
theyr plee endured yt the parlyament determyned
bycauſe the lady coulde make no proffe
agaynſt Iaques le Grys but by her owne wordes / 
that there ſholde be batayle at vtteraunce
bytwene them / and ſoo on a daye prefyxed the
knyght and his wyfe / and the ſquyer beynge
preſent Iudgement was gyuen / that the nexte
mondaye after mortall batayle ſholde be done
bytwene the knyght and the ſquyer / whiche
was in the yere of oure lorde god .M.CCC.
lxxx. and .vii. At whiche tyme the frenſſhe kynge
and his lordes were at Sluſe to the entente
to paſſe ouer the ſee in to Englande / and when
the kynge herde of that matter howe a daye of
batayle was taken to be at Parys / the kynge
ſayd he wolde ſe that batayle bytwene the knyght
and the ſquyer / the duke of Berre / the duke
of Borgoyne / the duke of Borbone / and the
conſtable of Fraunce / who had alſo grete deſyre
to ſe that batayle ſayd to the kynge / ſyr it is
good reaſon that ye be there and that it be done
in your preſence / then the kynge ſent to Parys
comaundynge that the iourney & batayle
bytwene the ſquyer and ye knyght ſholde be relonged
tyl his comynge to Parys / and ſo his
cōmaundement was obeyed.
            SO the kynge then retourned fro Sluſe
and helde the feeſt of Cryſtmas at
Arras / and the duke of Borgoyne at
Lyſle. And in the meane ſeaſon all other men
of warre paſſed and retourned in to Fraunce / 
euery man to his place as it was ordeyned by
the marſhalles / but the grete lordes retourned
to Parys to ſe the ſayd batayle. Thus the kynge
and his vncles and the conſtable came to
Parys. Then the lyſtes were made in a place
called ſaynt Katheryne behynde the temple / 
there was ſoo moche people that it was meruayle
to beholde / and on the one ſyde of the lyſtes
there was made grete ſcaffoldes that the
lordes myght the better ſe the batayle of the .ii.
champyons / and ſo they bothe came to the felde
armed at all peaces / and there eche of them
was ſet in theyr chayre / the erle of ſaynt Poule
gouerned Iohn̄ of Carongne and the erle of
Alanſons company with Iaques le Grys / and
when the knyght entred in to the felde he came
to his wyfe who was there ſyttynge in a chayre
couered in blacke / and he ſayd to her thus / 
Dame by your enformacyon and in your quarell
I do put my lyfe in aduenture as to fyght
with Iaques le Grys / ye knowe if the cauſe be
iuſt and true / ſyr ſayd the lady / it is as I haue
ſayd wherfore ye maye fyght ſurely / the cauſe
is good and true / with thoſe wordes the knyghte
kyſſed the lady and toke her by the hande
and then bleſſyd hym and ſoo entred in to the
felde / the lady ſate ſtyll in the blacke chayre in
her prayers to god and to the vyrgyne Mary
humbly prayenge them by theyr ſpecyall grace
to ſende her huſbande the vyctory accordynge
to the ryght he was in / this lady was in grete
heuynes 
                  •
               or ſhe was not ſure of her lyfe / for
yf her huſbande ſholde haue ben dyſcomfyted
ſhe was Iudged without remedy to be brente
and her huſbande hanged / I can not ſay whether
ſhe repented her or not yt the matter was
ſo forwarde / that bothe ſhe and her huſbande
were in grete peryll / howbeit fynally ſhe muſt
as then abyde the aduenture. Then theſe two
champyons were ſet one agaynſt another and
ſo mounted on theyr horſes / and behaued them
nobly / for they knewe what perteyned to deades
of armes / there were many lordes and knyghtes
of Fraunce that were come thyder to ſe
that batayle / ye two champyons iuſted at theyr
fyrſt metyng but none of them dyd hurte other
And after the Iuſtes they lyghted on foote to
perfourme theyr batayle and ſoo fought valyauntly.
And fyrſt Iohn̄ of Carongne was hurte
in the thyghe wherby al his frendes were in
grete fere / but after that he fought ſo valyauntly
that he bette downe his aduerſary to the erthe / 
and threſt his ſwerde in his body and ſoo
ſlewe hym in the felde / and then he demaunded
yf he had done his deuoyre or not / and they anſwered
that he hadde valyauntly acheued his
batayle. Then Iaques le Grys was delyuered
to the hangman of Parys / and he drewe
hym to the gybet of Mountfawcon and there
hanged hym vp. Then Iohn̄ of Carongne came
before the kynge and kneled downe / and ye
kynge made hym to ſtande vp before hym / and
the ſame daye the kynge cauſed to be delyuered
to hym a thouſande frankes / and reteyned
hym to be of his chambre with a pencyon of .ii.
hundred pounde by the yere durynge the terme
of his lyfe / then he thanked the kynge and
the lordes and went to his wyfe and kyſſed her
and then they wente togyder to the chyrche of

our Lady in Parys and made theyr offerynge
and then retourned to theyr lodgynges / then
this ſyr Iohn̄ of Carongue taryed not longe
in Fraunce but wente with ſyr Iohn̄ Boucequant
ſyr Iohn̄ of Bordes / & ſyr Loys Grat / 
all theſe wente to ſe and vyſyte the holy ſepulture / 
and to ſe Lamorabaquyn of whome in
thoſe dayes there was moche ſpekynge / and
with them wente Robonet of Bolowne a ſquyer
of honoure with the Frenſſhe kynge who in
his dayes made many voyages aboute in the
worlde.
         
         
            ¶How the kyng of Aragon dyed
and howe the archebyſſhoppe of
Burdeaus was ſette in pryſon in
Barcelona. Ca. lxi.
            
               THe ſame ſeaſon aboute
Candelmas kynge Peter of
Aragon fell ſyke in his bed / 
and when he ſawe yt he ſholde
dye he cauſed his two ſones
to come before hȳ Iohn̄
the elder and Martyne duke
of Blaſmont in Aragon and ſayd to them / 
fayre ſones I leue you in good poynte / and all
the buſynes of the royalme ſtandeth well and
clere kepe peas and loue bytwene you / and kepe
fayth and honoure eche to other ye ſhall doo
the better as for the feates of the chyrche accordynge
to my conſcyence and for the mooſt ſure
way / I haue alwayes holden the new tralyte
bytwene ye .ii. popes / and ſo I wolde ye ſholde
do tyl the determynacyon bytwene them apere
more clerely. The two ſones anſwered & ſayd / 
ſyr gladly we ſhall obey that ye commaunde &
ordeyne as it is reaſon / thus in this caſe dyed
kynge Peter of Aragon who had ben a ryght
valyaunt prynce in his dayes and gretely had
augmented the crowne and royalme of Aragon
and had conquered the royalme of Mayiorke / 
and had anexed it to his owne crowne / 
and he was buryed in the good cyte of Barcelona / 
& there he lyeth / and when his dethe was
knowen in Auygnyon with pope Clement &
his Cardynalles they wrote incotynent to ye
frenſſhe kynge and to his vncles / to the duke
of Barre and to the duches who was of theyr
oppynyon / and they were fader and moder to
the yonge quene that ſholde be in Aragon the
lady yolent / and alſo they wrote to her that all
theſe ſholde ſtyre and moue the yonge kynge
of Aragon to be of theyr opynyon / the frenſſhe
kynge / the duke of Berre and the duke of Borgoyne
ſente in to Aragon in legacyon a cardynall
to preche / and to ſtyre the yonge kynge &
his broder and the people of that royalme of
Aragon to take the oppynyon of Clement / the
Cardynall dydde ſoo moche with the ayde of
the lady yolent of Barre as then quene of Aragon
who gladly enclyned to that way bycauſe
ſhe was ſo inſtantly requyred therto by her fader
and moder / and by the frenſſhe kynge / and
dukes of Berre and Burgoyne her coſyns ſoo
that ſhe brought the kynge and the royalme to
be of the oppynyon of pope Clement. Howbeit
the kynge wolde haue ben ſtyl a newter as his
fader was.
            IN the ſame ſeaſon that the kynge of
Aragon thus dyed / there was at Barcelona
the archebyſſhoppe of Burdeaus
whome the duke of Lancaſtre had ſente
thyder in ambaſſade / I ſhall ſhewe yon / the
cauſe why. ¶The prynce of wales bycauſe
he was duke and lorde of the countrey of Acquytayne
and that all his neyghbours doubted
hym / as the Frenſſhe kynge / the kynge of
Aragon / the kynge of Spayne / and the kynge
of Nauare yea. And alſo kynges that were ſarazyns
that harde grete ſpekynge of hym / for
the good fortune and noble chyualrye that he
was of / and he hadde a certayne alyaunce and
confyderacyon with kynge Peter of Aragon / 
whiche leage was ſworne and ſealed bytwene
them / and it was confyrmed by the kynge of
Englande fader to the prynce.
            ANd amonge other thynges it was compryſed
that the kynge of Englande nor
the duke and lorde of Acquytayne ſholde make
ony warre nor conſente to make ony warre
agaynſt the roayalme of Aragon / for the whiche
the kynge of Aragon ſware and ſealed for
hym and for his ayres that euery yere he ſholde
ſerue the prynce of Acquytayne with the
nombre of fyue hundred ſperes agaynſt who
ſo euer he hadde to doo withall / or elles to ſende
vnto hym as moche money as ſholde wag
                  •
               
fyue hundreth ſperes. ¶And ſoo it was that

as then there was .x. yeres rynne in aterages
that the kynge of Aragon had payde nothyng
nor done ony ſeruyce to ye kynge of Englande
nor to his deputyes / and when the duke of Lancaſtre
wente out of Englande / he hadde with
hym letters patentes ſealed with the grete ſeale
of Englande / wherby he was ſtablyſſhed to
be the kynges Lyeutenaunt in the marches of
Burdeaus / Bayon / and Acquytayne / and the
kynge gaue hym fall puyſſaunce and auctoryroyall
to demaunde all ryghtes and due accyons
as well of the royalme of Aragon as elles
where / and wolde that the duke ſholde haue y•
profyte without ony excepcyon / and what ſoo
euer he dyd / to be ferme and ſtable ſo thus whē
the duke of Lancaſtre had ben a ſeaſon in the
towne of ſaynt Iames in Galyce / he remembred
hymſelfe of the buſynes of Aragon / and
perceyued well by reaſon of his commyſſyon / 
howe the kynge of Aragon was ſore in his det
in a grete ſome of money longe renne in arerages
whiche he thought if he myght gete / it ſholde
gretely ayde hym in his warres of Caſtell / 
and ſoo he ſente to the archebyſſhop of Burdeaus / 
and to ſyr Iohn̄ Harpedan who was ſeneſſhall
of all Burdeloys commaundynge thē
bothe or at the leeſt one of them to go in to Aragon
to ye kynge there / and to ſhewe hym playnly
howe he was in grete arrerages with the
kynge of Englande and with the duke of Acquytayne / 
the archebyſſhoppe and the Seneſſhall
behelde well the duke of Lancaſtres letters / 
and ſoo toke counſayle togyder theron / 
and there they determyned that it was beſt yt
the Seneſſhall ſholde 
                  ••
               ry ſtyll at Burdeaus
and the byſſhop to take on hym the charge of
that voyage / and ſoo he dyd / and he came in to
Aragon in ſo euyll a ſeaſon that the kynge the
relaye ſyke and dyed / and after the kynges dethe
the archebyſſhop pourſued his cauſe and
folowed the kynges chyldren and ye counſayle
of the royalme who came to the kynges enterment
to ye cyte of Barcelona / and this byſſhop
purſued his ambaſſade ſo affectuouſly that he
was ſet in a courtoyſe pryſon ſo that he coulde
not departe when he wolde / when theſe tydynges
came to Burdeaus to ye ſeneſſhall there / he
ſayd I thought neuer none other wyſe / for ye archebyſſhop
is haſty & heedy / I thynke nowe it
had ben better that I had gone / for I wolde
haue ſpoken moore mekely / there is a maner
thrughout all the worlde howe to demaunde a
mannes ryght / the ſeneſſhall ſente theſe tydynges
to the duke of Lancaſtre in to Galyce who
was therwith ryght ſore dyſpleaſed and euyll
contente with the kynge of Aragon and his
counſayle that they had put the archebyſſhop
in to pryſon for doynge of his ambaſſade / then
the duke of Lancaſtre wrote to the companyons
of the garyſon of Lourde / that they ſholde
make warre agaynſt them of Barcellona where
as the archebyſſhoppe of Burdeaus was in
pryſon.
            IOhn̄ of Byerne who was capytayne there
and ſeneſſhall of Bygore / Pier Dauchyn / 
Ernalton of Reſten / Ernalton of ſaynt
Colombe and other of the garyſon of Lourde
were gretely reioyſed when they herde that tydynges / 
and then began to rynne in to the royalme
of Aragon to the portes of Barcelona ſo
that no merchaunt durſt go abrode. ¶Alſo in
Aragon there was another myſchefe / for the
yonge kynge Iohn̄ of Aragon wolde haue ben
crowned kynge of Aragon / but the good townes
wolde not conſente therto without he ſware
fyrſt ſolemply that he ſholde neuer demaunde
tayle / taxe / nor inpoſycyon in all ye countrey
and dyuers other thynges that he ſholde ſwere
and put it in wrytynge ſealed yf he wolde be
crowned kynge / whiche thynge ſemed to hym
and to his counſayle to be ryght preiudycyall
Wherfore he thretened to make them warre / 
and ſpecyally to them of the cyte of Barcelona
for the kynge ſayd they were to ryche and to
prowde.
            IN the ſame ſeaſon there was in Langue
docke and on the fronters of Auuergue
and of Rouergue to warde Pezanas and ye cyte
of Duzes / a maner of men of armes called ye
Rowtes / & they dayly multyplyed to do euyll / 
and .iiii. men of armes were capytaynes who
demaunded warre agaynſt euery man / they cared
not agaynſt whom / theyr names were Peter
of Mount fawcon / Geffray Chaſtelyer / 
Hamgue de forge / and the goulent. They had
a foure hundreth men vnder them / who ryfled
and pylled the countrey where as they were
conuerſaunt / and when they were enfourmed
that ye archebyſſhop of Burdeaus was in pryſon
in Aragon / and that the duke of Lancaſtre
was not contente with the Aragonoys / and
alſo that the kynge of Aragon was euyll pleaſed
with the good townes of his royalme and
countrey. And they were of theſe tydynges

gretely reioyſed / for ſuche people as they were
are rather pleaſed with euyll dedes then with
good. They toke counſayle bytwene them &
determyned to approche to Aragon and to gete
ſome forterers on thoſe fronters / thynkynge
then that the duke of Aragon or elles ſome of ye
good townes wolde entreate with the to theyr
profyte. So they rode coſtynge the countrey &
ſet theyr myndes to gete yf they myght the caſtell
of Dulcen beynge in ye archbyſſhopryche
of Narbone bytwene the royalme of Aragon
and Fraunce on the departynge of bothe royalmes / 
they came thyder at ſuche a poynte and
by nyght / that they founde it but ſymply watched
nor kepte / they dyd ſoo moche yt they wan
it & were lordes thereof / wherby al the countrey
was afrayde & ſpecyally they of Parpygnen / 
for it was but .iiii. legges thens / alſo they of
Lourde gate ye ſame weke a caſtell in Aragon
a .iiii. legges fro Barcelona called the olde caſtell
of Rolbays perteynynge to the counteſſe
of Caſtell Boze coſyn germayne to the erle of
Foys. The lady was gretely abaſſhed when
her caſtell was ſo taken / ſhe ſente to her coſyn
the erle of Foys deſynge hym for goddes ſake
to rendre agayne to her the ſayd caſtell whiche
they of his coūtrey of Berne had taken fro her
ye erle ſent to her yt ſhe ſholde not be afrayde for
ony thynge / certefyenge her yt it was taken but
alonely to make war agaynſt thē of Bercelona
who helde in pryſon for a ſmal cauſe ye byſſhop
of Burdeaus / ſayenge howe ſhe ſholde haue it
ryght well agayne without ony domage / ye lady
was well peaſed with his anſwere & dyſſymuled
the matter and went and lay at another
caſtell nere to Roqueberton and they of the caſtell
of Rolbays / and of Dulcen and of Lourde
made ſore warre on the fronters of Aragon / &
to ſay the trouth the kynge there dyſſymuled ye
matter to chaſtyſe therby ye good townes yt were
agaynſt hȳ / ſo that ye good townes were ſore
dyſpleaſed with the kynge / for they of Barcelona
of Perpygnen & of other townes coulde
not exercyſe theyr merchaūdyſe / but they were
taken and raunſomed / then they of Barcelona
aduyſed to delyuer the archebyſſhop of Burdeaus
out of pryſon and for his delyeraunce to
ſpeke with the kynge as it was reaſon / and ſoo
pryuely by a meane they treated with the kynges
broder ſyr Martyne duke of Blaſemont
who was gretly in ye grace of all ye people deſyrynge
hym to be meane to the kynge his broder
yt they myght be in peas wt them of Lourde
& of Rolbays he promyſed them to do his beſt / 
to kepe them in his fauoure / and he dyd ſo moche
with the kynge his broder that the archebyſſhop
of burdeaus was delyuered out of pryſon
and ſente in to Burdeloys / and alone after
the erle of Foys dyd ſo moche that the vycounteſſe
recouered agayne her caſtel / and ſuche as
helde it departed / this ſeruyce dyd the erle of
Foys that yere to the duke of Lancaſtre.
            
               WHen the kynge of Aragon ſawe that the
counteſſe of caſtell Boze had ſoo ſoone
agayne recouered her caſtell he ſent for
her / and ſhe came to hym / then the kynge layde
to her charge howe ſhe had ſuffered ye englyſſh
men to entre in to her caſtell to make warre to
his royalme / ſaynge how ſhe had done to hym
a grete treſpace / the lady truely excuſed her &
ſayd / ſyr as god knoweth & by the fayth I owe
to you / the day and houre that tydynges came
to me of ye takynge of my caſtell by the of Lourde
I neuer had before no treaty wt the englyſſh
mē / but ſyr incōtynent I ſent to my coſyn ye erle
of Foys prayng hȳ for goddes ſake to gete me
agayne my caſtell / ſeynge that they yt had gotten
it were of his countrey of Byerne and were
yſſued out of Lourde / and the erle ſente to me
& bad me not doubte / ſayenge how the takyng
of it was but to make warre agaynſt them of
Barcelona / wel ſayd ye kynge proue your wordes
by your coſyn the erle of Foys and ye ſhall
enioy peaſybly ſtyll your caſtell wt a good wyl
ſyr ſayd ye lady / ſhe ſent to her coſyn the erle of
Foys / who was at Ortays in Byerne / prayng
hym to apeaſe the matter with ye kynge of Aragon.
The erle then ſent letters to ye kynge by a
knyght of his called ſyr Cycarte of Saurelyn
deſyrynge the kynge to ſuffre his coſyn the vycountes
to be in peas and to lyue in reſt vnder
hym / or elles ſurely he wolde dyſpleaſe hym / ye
kynge of Aragon toke the excuſacyons in gre
and made grete chere to the erles knyght / and
ſayd howe the counteſſe had but wel doneſyth
her coſyn the erle of Foys dyd ſo largely excuſe
her / thus the lady lyued in peas / but the merchauntes
of Barcelona and of ye fronters there
aboute were not in no reſt for them of Lourde
but often tymes were taken and pylled without
they were agreed and pateſed with them &
ſo they had dyuers in Caſtellon & in Aragon / 
In lyke wyſe ſo dyd they of ye garyſon of Dulcen
& dyd worſe then they dyd before for they
were more egre & ouer ran ye countrey of Aragon / 
then they of Lourde dyd / bycauſe they
were poore they cared not whom they toke as

well offycers of the kynges & ſquyers as merchauntes / 
ſoo that the kynges counſayle toke
aduyſe bycauſe the good townes murmured &
ſayd howe the kynge dyſtroyed them and he
ought to ſuſteyne them.
            
               WHen the yonge kynge of Aragon vnderſtode
yt his men murmured & ſpake
of hym otherwyſe then they ſholde
do bycauſe of them of the garyſon of Dulcen / 
he was therwith ſore dyſpleaſed / bycauſe he
was newly fallen to his faders herytage who
was ſo well byloued in his royalme of all his
people / then he ſpake to a coſyn of his a grete
baron in Aragon ſyr Raymon of Baghes and
ſayd ſyr Raymon I deſyre you to ryde to Dulcen / 
and demaunde of them that be there what
thyng they deſyre of me or of my royalme / and
trete ſo with them that they may departe thēs
outher by fayrnes or otherwyſe. The knyght
departed and ſente to Dulcen an heraulde before
hym ſhewynge them howe he wolde trete
with them / when Mountfawcon & le Goulus
and the other capytaynes vnderſtode that ſyr
Raymon of Baghes wolde trete with them / 
then they thought at the leeſt to gete ſome money / 
and ſayd to the heraulde / ſyr ſaye to your
mayſter fro vs / that he maye come to vs ſurely
for we wyll no hurte to hym. The heraulde retourned
to ſyr Raymon who vpon his wordes
departed fro Paregant and came to Dulcen / 
and demaūded of them why they taryed there
on ye fronters of Aragon / they anſwered & ſayd
we abyde here the army of fraunce yt ſholde go
in to Caſtel to go in cōpany with them. A ſyrs
ſayd ſyr Raymon yf ye tary therfore ye ſhall
abyde a grete ſeaſon. The kynge of Aragon
wyll not retayne you ſo longe nor yet the countrey
ſuffre you ſo longe / well ſyr ſayd they if he
wyll not enterteyne vs ſo longe we can not do
withall / yet we muſt lyue / yf he or the countrey
wyll by this our garyſon we wyll departe or
elles not / well ſayd ſyr Raymon what wyll ye
deſyre to departe / they anſwered .lx.M. frankes / 
we be .iiii. capytanes that is to eche of vs
xv. M. frankes / in the name of god ſayd ſyr
Raymon that is money ynoughe. I wyll ſpeke
with the kynge and ſo departed / and ſayd
it were better for the comon profyte of ye countrey
that the kynge payde that money then to
take a greter domage / and that he ſayd to appeaſe
them. Howbeit he thought the contrary.
            THus he departed fro them & gaue them
vnderſtandynge that they ſholde haue

to the kynge to Perpyghnen and ſhewed hym
what theſe pyllers deſyred / Well ſayd ye kynge
it is behoueable that ye countrey be delyuered
of them / and that they be payde as theues and
brybours ſholde be payde / yf I may gete them
they ſhall be hanged / other payment gete they
none of me / but all the dyffyculte is how to gete
them out of theyr garyſon / ſyr ſayd ſyr Raymon
yt ſhall be done ryght well / let them alone
Well ſayd the kynge doo as ye thynke beſt / I
wyll medle no more therin / but that I wolde
they were delyuered out of the countrey / then
on a day ſyr Raymon gathered a company togyder
of men of armes a .v. hundred ſperes ſecretly
and made a ſquyer of Gaſcoyne capytayne
a valyaunt man of armes called Nandon
Seghen and layde them in a buſſhment within
a lytell myle of Dulcen & ſayd to them / ſyrs
when they of the garyſon yſſue out do ſo that
they may all be taken or ſlayne that the countrey
maye be clene ryd of them. Then ſyr Raymon
ſente to them of Dulcen that they ſholde
lepe on theyr horſes and yſſue out and rynne
before ye towne of Perpyghnen to put the vyllaynes
therof in fere / elles they wolde not obey
nor gyue nothynge. They of Dulcen were ryght
ioyfull of theſe tydynges thynkynge that
all had ben trouth and ſo armed them the ſame
day that the buſſhment was layde for them / &
ſo departed fro the garyſon and rode towarde
Perpyghnen and ſo came to the barryers and
made theyr muſters and in theyr retournynge
thynknge to haue paſſed ſurely in peas when
they were in the myddes of the way they were
ſodaynly encountred by Nandon Seghnen &
his company to the nombre of .v.C. ſperes / &
ſo daſſhed in amonge them / then they ſaw wel
howe they were dyſceyued and trapped / and
then they drewe togyder and fought as longe
as they myght endure / whiche was not longe
for there were many of them were euyll armed
and ſo ſhortely they were dyſcomfyted / There
was ſlyne Geffray chaſtelyer / Hauge deſorge
Guyot Moreſque / Iohn̄ de Guenlant / & many
other / & there was taken Peter of Mountfawcon / 
Amlardan of ſaynt Iuſt & a .xl. other
and brought pryſoners to Perpyghnen / & as
they paſſed thrughe the ſtretes / they of ye towne
yſſued out of theyr houſes & halowed after
them as thoughe they had ben wolues / and ſo
they were ſet in pryſones. The ſame ſeaſon the

duke of Berre was come to Carcaſſone / & on
ye fronters of Aragon he came fro Auygnyon
fro the pope / and there he herde howe they of
Dulcen were ſlayne and taken / then he wrote
to the kynge of Aragon and to his coſyne yoſant
of Bare deſyrynge them to ſende Peter of
Mountfawcon and his company / who incontynent
were delyuered and ſente to the duke of
Berre / that grace yt duke dyd to them / or elles

ought to haue ben ryghtful enherytour of Bretayne
as it hath ben ſhewed before in this hyſtory
whoſe ſones were in Englande in hoſtage

moche that the erle of Monforde came to his
entente and was duke of Bretayne otherwyſe
he coulde neuer haue come therto / for in Bretayne
ye lorde Charles of Bloys of .vii. he had
euer .v. on his party / it hath ben ſhewed before
howe in the yere of our lorde a .M.CCC. and
xlvii. there was a grete batayle in Bretayne
before the Ree doryent where the counteſſe of
Mountfordes party / as ſyr Iohn̄ of Harcell

and other dyſcomfyted ſyr Charles of Bloys
and there he was taken pryſoner & led in to englande
where he had good chere / for the quene
of Englande ye good quene Phylyp whos ſeruaunt
I was in myne yongth / ſhe was of ryghtfull
gouernacyon coſyn germayne to ye lorde
Charles of Bloys / & ſhe dyd put to her payne
for his delyuerauce / howbeit the counſayle
of Englande wolde not that he ſholde be delyuered / 
the duke Henry of Lancaſtre ſayd and
other lordes of englande that yf he were out of
pryſon by hym myght be made many grete recoueraunces
for the royalme of Fraunce / for
kynge Phylyp as then frenſſhe kyng was his
vncles / and they affyrmed that as longe as he
were kepte in pryſon / theyr warre in to Fraunce
ſholde be ye eaſyer / howbeit for all thoſe wordes
that was ſhewed to the kynge by the good
meanes of the noble and good quene he was
ſet to his fynaunce to paye .CC.M. nobles / 
whiche was as then a grete ſome to be payde
for lordes as then lyued in another maner thē
they do nowe / for as nowe men may pay more
then theyr predeceſſours myght haue done / for
nowe they tayle theyr people at theyr pleaſure
and before they lyued but on theyr rentes and
reuenues / for as nowe the duchy of Bretayne
wtin a yere or two is able to pay to helpe theyr
lorde .ii.M. nobles or more. The lorde Charles
of Bloys layde to the kynge of Englande
his .ii. ſones in pledge for ye ſayd ſome / & afterwarde
the lorde Charles of Bloys had ſo moche
to do in purſuyng his warre for the duchy
of Bretayne and to pay his ſouldyours / and to
kepe his eſtate alwayes hopynge to come to a
good ende of his warre ſo yt he was not able to
quyte out his ſones out of Englande for ye holy
man in purſuynge of his herytage dyed as
a ſaynt in a batayle in Bretayne before aulroy
by the ayde of the Englyſſhe men who were
agaynſt hym / when he was deed yet the warre
ended not / but then kynge Charles of fraunce
who in his lyfe doubted gretly the fortunes of
the warres / when he ſawe that the erle Mountforde
& the Englyſſhe men ſeaſed not but ſtyll
wente forwarde / & wanne townes & fortreſſes
in Bretayne / he fered yt yf ye erle Mountforde
myght come to his entente of the duchy of Bretayne / 
that he wolde not holde nor do homage
to hym / for he had promyſed his alleageaunce
to the kynge of englande who ayded & alwaye
hadde done to maynteyne his warre / then he
treted wt the erle Mountforde & his counſayle
as it hath ben ſhewed here before / wherfore I
wyll ſpeke no more therof / but ye erle of Moūtforde
abode as duke of Bretayne with that he
ſholde do homage and holde ſoueraynte or the
crowne of fraunce / and by the ſame trety ye duke
ſholde ayde & helpe to gete delyuered out of
pryſon in englande his .ii. coſyns ſones to the
lorde Charles of Bloys / whiche artycle he neuer
dyd accomplyſſhe / for alwayes he doubted
that yf they retourned they wolde put hym to
ſome buſynes for ye duchy of Bretayne & fered
leſt they of Bretayne wolde receyue them as
theyr lordes / for they more enclyned to thē then
to hym / wherfore he wolde not ſpeke for theyr
delyueraunce. Thus theſe .ii. chyldren abode
ſo longe in Englande in pryſon / ſomtyme in ye
kepynge of the lorde Roger Beawchamp and
the lady Sybyll his wyfe / and ſomtyme with
ſyr Thomas Dambrychcourte / on a tyme the
yonger Guy of Bretayne dyed / then Iohn̄ of
Bretayne abode ſtyll in pryſon alone / he was
often tymes ſad of his beynge in pryſon / but he
coulde not amēde it. And often tymes when he
remembred the loſſe of his yonge dayes as he
that was of the mooſt noble generacyon of the
worlde / & was lykely to leſe / he wolde often tymes
wepe / and wyſſhed hymſelfe rather deed
then a lyue / for a .xxxv. yeres or theraboute he
had ben in the daunger of his enemyes in Englande / 
and coulde ſe noo maner of meanes of
his delyueraunce / for his frendes and kynne
drewe of fro hym / and the ſome that he laye for
was ſo grete that he wyſt not how it ſholde be
payde without god helped hym / and the duke
of Anioy for all his puyſſaunce and proſperyte
and that he had wedded his ſyſter germayne / 
by whom he had .ii. fayre ſones / Loys & Charles
for all this he dyd nothynge for hym. Now
ſhall I ſhew you howe this Iohn̄ of Bretayne
was delyuered.
         
         
            ¶Howe Iohn̄ of Bretayne ſone to
ſyr Charles of Bloys was delyuered
out of pryſon by the meanes of
Olyuer of Clyſſon the conſtable of
Fraunce. Ca. lxxii.
            
               IT hathe ben ſhewed
here before in this hyſtory
how the erle of Buckynghā
made a voyage thrughe the
royalme of Fraunce & came
in to Bretayne / the duke of
Bretayne had deſyred hym

ſo to doo bycauſe parte of his countrey wolde
not be vnder his obeyſaunce / there the erle of
Buckyngham & his company lay al y• wynter
& the begynnyng of ſomer 
                  〈◊〉
                in grete pouerte / 
before Nantes & Wennes tyll it was Maye
& then he retourned in to englande / & when the
erle. Thomas of Buckyngham & his company
laye before Wennes in lodgynges without.
There were dyuers ſkyrmyſſhes bytwene the
englyſſhment & frenſſhmen / & thyder came Olyuer
Clyūon conſtabable of Fraunce to ſe the
warre yt was there made / & to ſpeke with ye englyſſhe
knyghtes / for he knewe them well / for
in his yongth he was brought vp amonge thē
in Englande / & ſoo he made good company wt
them in diuers maners as noble men of armes
wyll do eche to other / & as frenſſhmen and englyſſhmē
haue alwayes done / & as then he had
good cauſe ſo to do / for he entended a purpoſe
whiche touched hym ryght nere / but he wolde
dyſcouer his entente to noo man lyuynge but
alonely to a ſquyer that was there who had alwayes
before ſerued ye lorde Charles of bloys
for yf the conſtable had dyſcouered his entente
to ouy man he had ben out of all hope to haue
ſped & brought aboute his purpoſe whiche by
the grace of god he atteyned vnto. The conſtable
coulde in no wyſe loue ye duke of Bretayne
nor he hym longe tyme or they ſhewed it. And
where as he ſawe Iohn̄ of Bretayne in pryſon
in englande he had therof grete pyte / & whē he
ſawe the duke of Bretayne in poſſeſſyon of the
herytage of Bretayne / & when he thought that
he was in mooſt loue with ye duke then he ſayd
ſyr why do ye not put to your payne that your
coſyn Iohn̄ of Bretayne were out of the kyng
of Englandes pryſon ſyr ye are bounde therto
by othe & promyſe / for ſyr when all the countrey
of Bretayne was in treaty with you / ye prelates
noble men & good townes & the cyte of
Nantes & Archebyſſhop of Reynes / ſyr Iohn̄
Craon / ſyr Boncequalte / as then marſhall of
fraunce 
                  •
               reted wt you for the peas before Compercorentync / 
than & there ye ſware yt ye ſholde
do your full puyſſaunce to delyuer your coſynes
out of pryſon & ſyr ye haue done nothynge
in that matter. Wherfore be you ſure the countrey
of Bretayne loueth you the leſſe & oweth
you the ſmaller fauoure / ye duke to his demaū
               de
dyſſymuled & ſayd / holde your peas ſyr Olyuer / 
where ſhalde I gete .iii. or .iiii.M. frankes
that is demaunded for theyr raunſomes.
Syr ſayd the conſtable yf the countrey of Bretayne
ſawe that you were wel wyllynge to the
matter / they wolde be contente to pay a taxe 
                  •
               
               a
fowage to delyuer the pryſon ers who are lyke
to dye in priſon without god helpe them / ſy-Olyuer
ſayd ye duke as for my countrey of bretayne
ſhall not be taxed for me / my coſynes haue
grete prynces of theyr lygnage as ye frenſſh
kynge / and the duke of Anioy / they may helpe
to delyuer them / for they haue alwayes ſuſteyned
the warre agaynſt me / and when I ſware
to ayde to theyr delyueraunce myne entencyon
was none otherwyſe but that ye frenſſhe kynge
or theyr kynſmen ſholde pay theyr raunſomes
the conſtable coulde gete of ye duke none other
anſwere / thus as I haue begon to ſhewe you.
The conſtable ſawe clerely howe ye erle of bu
                  •
               
               kyngham
& the barons & knyghtes of englande
ſuche as hadde ben with hym in the voyage
thrughe fraunce & ſo in to Bretayne were nothynge
contente with the duke of Bretayne bycauſe
he wolde not open his townes to them lyke
as he had promyſed when he departed out
of Englande / but whyles the englyſſhmen lay
before wennes & in the ſubbarbes of Nanibont
they endured grete pouerte / for they hadde nothynge
to ete and theyr horſes dyed for fawte
of foode. The englyſſhmen were fayne to gather
the thyſtelles in the feldes & braye them in
a morter & tempre it with water and make ther
of a paaſt & ſo bake it to ete / ſuche pouerte they
endured / and they ſayd amonge themſelfe / the
duke doth not acquyte hymſelfe nobly agaynſt
vs ſyth we haue put hȳ in poſſeſſyon of ye ſygnory
of Bretayne / and yf we ſholde do well we
ſholde take it fro hym agayne and gete out of
pryſon Iohn̄ of Bretayne his aduerſary & make
hym duke / the countrey loueth hym better
then he that is now duke / We can not better be
reuenged of hym nor ſoner to cauſe hym to leſe
the duchy of Bretayne / the conſtable of fraunce
knewe ryght well what wordes & ſore murmuracyons
the englyſſhmen had amonge themſelfe
agaynſt the duke of Bretayne / wherwith
he was nothynge dyſpleaſed / for euery euyll
worde that they ſpake he wolde it had ben .xii.
Howbeit he made therof no ſemblaunt / no more
dyd a ſquyer of Bretayne to whome he had
broken his mynde / to go in to englande on his
meſſage / this ſquyer was called Rollant / and
ſo it was that ſyr Iohn̄ of Harleton capytayne
of Chyerbourge was with the conſtable at the
caſtel Ioſſelyn vnder ſaufconduyte / and there
the conſtable made hym good chere and to his
company and kepte the englyſſhmen as good
company as he coulde the rather therby to gete

theyr good wylles / then ye conſtable ſquyer
auaunced forth & ſpake to ſyr Iohn̄ Harleton
before the conſtable & ſayd / ſyr Iohn̄ ye ſholde
do me a grete pleaſure to do one thynge for me
whiche ſhall coſt you nothynge / ſyr ſayd y• knyght
for the loue of the conſtable though it be to
my coſt I am contente to do that I can for you
what is that I ſholde do / ſyr ſayd the ſquyer yt
I myght be aſſured to go in to Englande to ſemyne
olde mayſter Iohn̄ of Bretayne / the gretteſt
deſyre that I haue in this worlde is to ſe
hym / by my fayth ſayd ſyr Iohn̄ harlton it ſhal
not be let for me but that ye ſhal go as ſoone as
I am retourned to Chyerbourge I wyll go in
to englande / & ye ſhal go with me I ſhal bryng
you thyder / for your requeſt is not to be refuſed / 
ſyr ſayd the ſquyer I thanke you / and I repute
it for a grete curtoyſy. Thus this ſquyer
wente with ſyr Iohn̄ Harlton to Chyerbourg
and when he had made euery thyng redy he departed
and entred in to the ſee with Iohn̄ Rollant
in his company & ſo came to London and
brought the ſquyer to ye caſtell where as Iohn̄
of Bretayne was who knewe hym not at the
fyrſt metynge / at ye laſt he called hym to his remembraunce
& ſo ſpake togyder / & there he ſhewed
Iohn̄ of Bretayne / howe that the conſtable
of fraunce dyd & wolde do his payne for his
delyueraunce / howe can yt be ſayd Iohn̄ of Bretayne / 
ſyr ſayd y• ſquyer I ſhall ſhewe you / my
lorde the conſtable hath a doughter to mary / ſo
that yf ye wyll ſwere & promyſe when ye be retourned
in to Bretayne to take her to your wyfe
he wyll delyuer you out of englande / he hath
founde well the meanes how / ſyr howe ſay you
wyll ye do thus / ye truely ſayd he / ye ſhall retourne
to the conſtable & ſay in my name howe
there is nothynge I may doo to be delyuered
but I wyll do it / & as for his doughter gladly
I wyll take her to my wyfe / thus the ſquyer &
Iohn̄ of Bretayne departed & paſſed out of englande
& retourned in to Bretayne & recorded
to the conſtable all yt he had ſene & harde / & the
cōſtable who deſyred the aduauncement of his
doughter as to be maried ſo highly as to Iohn̄
of Bretayne was not neglygent in his buſynes
& ſtudyed for a meane in Englande to brynge
aboute his purpoſe / & without he had founde
out a meanes as he dyd he ſholde neuer haue
come to his purpoſe / whiche was to gete ye erle
of Oxenforde on his parte who was moſt pryuy
with ye kynge of Englande as then / but this
matter was not ſhortly brought to paſſe / for as
longe as ye duke of Lancaſtre was in englande
and before his iourney in to ſpayne / there was
no dyſcouerynge to the kynge of the tretye for
delyueraunce of Iohn̄ of Bretayne / for when ye
erle of Buckyngham retourned out of Bretayne
the renome ran thrughe al the royalme how
ye duke of Bretayne had falſely acquyted hym
ſelfe to the Englyſſhmen wherfore was ſpoken
all ye euyll that coulde be deuyſed / & then Iohn̄
of Bretayne was brought in to the kynges preſence
and to his vncles / & then it was ſayd to
hym / Iohn̄ of Bretayne yf ye wyll releue & holde
the duchy of Bretayne of the kynge of Englande
ye ſhall be delyuered out of pryſon and
ſet in poſſeſſyon of the ſygnory of Bretayne / &
ſhall be ryght hyghly maryed in this countrey
as ye ought to be / for ye duke of Lancaſtre wo
                  •
               
               de
haue gyuen hym to his doughter Phylyp
in maryage who was after quene of Portyngale / 
Iohn̄ of Bretayne anſwered yt he wolde
neuer agree to that tretye nor neuer wolde be
enemye nor contrary to the crowne of Fraunce
he ſayd he was contente to take the duke of Lā
               caſtres
doughter in maryage ſoo he myght be
delyuered out of pryſon & out of englande / whē
they ſawe he wolde do none otherwyſe he was
ſet agayne in pryſon / and after the erle or Oxenforde
whom we called duke of Irelande ſawe
that the duke of Lancaſtre was gone out of englande
in to Caſtell / and that the tretye of the
maryage of his doughter with Iohn of Bretayne
was paſſed / for ye duke of Lancaſtre had
his doughter with hym in to Caſtell / then he
thought to ratrete ye kyng of englande to gyue
hym in rewarde for ſuche ſeruyce as he had done
and entended to do Iohn̄ of Brtayne / for yf
he coulde gete hym of the kyng he was agreed
with the conſtable of Fraunce to haue for his
raunſome at two paymentes .vi. ſcore .M. frā
               kes / 
ye fyrſt .lx.M. to be payde as ſone as Iohn̄
of Bretayne were ſent & delyuered in to ye towne
of Boloyne / and ye other .lx. M. to be payde
at Parys wherſoeuer he wolde haue it delyuered / 
ye duke of Irelande coueted theſe floreyns
and dyd ſo moche with the kynge of englande
yt the kynge gaue hym Iohn̄ of Bretayne clerely / 
wherof many in Englande had grete meruayle / 
but they that lyſt to ſpeke wolde ſpeke / 
there was none other thynge / the duke of Irelande
cauſed hym to be delyuered in to Boloyne / 
and there the conſtable had made redy
euery thynge for hym / dnd ſo he rode to Parys
and there founde the kynge and other lordes
of his lygnage who made hym good chere and
the conſtable alſo who brought hym in to Bretayne / 

and there Iohan of Bretayne wedded
his doughter as he had promyſed / and when ye
duke of Bretayne knewe that Iohn̄ of Bretayne
was retourned in to Fraunce and clene delyuered
out of Englande by the ayde and purchaſe
to the conſtable of Fraunce / then he had ye
cōſtable in double hatred & ſayd / what / weneth
ſyr Olyuer of Cleſſon to put me out of myne herytage / 
he ſheweth wel the tokens therof / he hath
delyuered out pryſon Iohn̄ of Bretayne
and hath gyuen hym his doughter in marriage
whiche thynges are to me ryght dyſpleaſaunt
& ſurely that ſhall I well ſhewe ones on a daye
howe he hath not wel done peraduenture whē
he taketh leeſt hede therof / he ſayd truely for he
ſhewed it quyckely or ye yere paſſed / as ye ſhall
here after in the ſtory. But fyrſt we wyll ſpeke
of the buſynes of Caſtell and Portyngale and
of an armye on the ſee yt the englyſſhmen made
to come to Sluſe.
            HEre before ye haue herde how ye frenſſhe
kynges armye by the ſee to haue gone in
to englande was broken vp in the ſame ſeaſon
not by ye frenſſhe kynges good wyll / for alway
he ſhewed good courage to haue paſſed in to
Englande / and when he ſawe howe ye iourney
brake he was more dyſpleaſed then ony other / 
and all the fawte was layde vpon the duke of
Berre / howbeit it was to be thought yt he ſaw
more depelyer in the matter then ony other / &
in his counſayllynge to leue the iourney was
for the honoure and profyte of the royalme of
fraunce▪ for who ſoo euer enterpryſed to doo a
thynge ought to regarde what ende may come
therof and the duke of Berre had ben before ſo
longe in englande in hoſtage for ye kyng his fader
& had ben ſo cōuerſaunt among ye englyſſh
men / & had ſene ſo moche of ye countrey that he
knewe by reaſon what effecte the goynge in to
englande ſholde haue come to / & ye cauſe mooſt
exſcuſable not to go was bycauſe wynter was
ſo farre ronne. But then it was ſayd yt the conſtable
of fraunce the nexte ſomer ſholde goo in
to englande with a .vi. M. men of armes and
as many croſſe bowes / for it was thought by
hymſelfe & ſayd howe that nombre was ſufficy
to fyght with the englyſſhe men / by reaſon the
conſtable ought to haue knowen it / for he had
ben nouryſſhed there in his yonge dayes / whē
theſe lordes were retourned in to Fraunce / thē
it was determyned to ſende ſocours in to Caſtell
to ayde the kynge there agaynſt the kynge
of Portyngale and the duke of Lancaſtre / for
it was thought that ſhortely there ſholde be ſome
dedes of armes / for the englyſſhmen kepte
the felde. And it was conſydered yt they coulde
ſende noo men of warre thyder without grete
coſt and charge / for the iourney was ferre of / &
there was but lytell money in the kynges treaſoury
nor in treaſourers handes / for the ſome
of money that had ben gadered of the people before
in the royalme was ſpente & waſted wherfore
they ſtudyed howe to gete more / and ſoo a
newe tayle and taxe was deuyſed to ryn thrughout
all the royalme of Fraunce / to be payde
incontynent without delay / noyſynge howe it
was for the comfortynge of ye kynge of Spayne
and to dryue the englyſſhmen out of his royalme.
This tayle was publyſſhed in euery place / 
and the kynges commyſſyoners ſente in to
euery good towne and Cyte / who ſayd to the
gouernours of the townes. Syrs thus moche
your towne is taxed at / the whiche ye muſt pay
incontynent / then the rulers ſayd / ſyrs we ſhall
gather this ſome and then ſende it to Parys / 
nay ſyrs not ſo ſayd the commyſſaryes / we wyl
not abyde ſo longe / we wyll do otherwyſe then
ſo / and commaunded in the kynges name a .x.
or xii. of the beſt of the towne to goo to pryſon
without they payde the ſome without ony longer
delay / the honeſt men fered the pryſon and
the kynges dyſpleaſure / wherfore they drewe
them togyder and payde the money incontynente / 
and recouered it agayne of the poore mē
thus they dyd in euery good towne / ſo that there
were ſo many tayles and taxes one after and
ther / for the fyrſt was ſcante payde when another
began / thus in that ſeaſon the noble royal
me of fraunce was gouerned and ye poore people
ouer ledde. So that many auoyded out of
theyr townes and forſoke theyr herytages and
houſes / for they were fayne to ſell all that they
had / and ſome wente to dwell in Haynalte and
in to the byſſhopryche of Lyege / where as there
ranne no taxe nor tayllage.

ſunken on bothe partyes / for out of the toppes
they caſt downe grete barres of yron / where as
they wente to the botom / this was an harde batayle
& well fought / for it endured a .iii. or .iiii.

bytwene Blanqueberg & Sluſe agaynſt Gagant
there was ye dyſcomfyture / for they were
not ſocoured by no creature / nor alſo at yt tyme
there were noo ſhyppes at Sluſe nor men of

of armes at Sluſe called Arnolde the mayre / 
when he harde howe there was batayle on the

Flaunders he toke a barke of his owne and entred
therin and with hym a certayne men of
Sluſe / and twenty croſſe bowes / and rowed
by force tyll he came to the batayle / but yt was
at the poynte of the dyſcomfyture / for by that
tyme the englyſſhmen were ſeaſed of the mooſt
parte of the flemyſſhe ſhyppes and had taken
ſyr Iohn̄ Bucke theyr capytayne & his ſhyp &
all that were within it / and when this Arnolde
the mayre ſawe ye maner of that batayle he made
his croſſe bowes to ſhote .iii. tymes & then
retourned and was chaſed into the hauen of
Sluſe but the englyſſhmennes ſhyppes were
ſo grete that they coulde not approche ſo nere
ye lande as the barke dyd / and therby he ſaued
hymſelfe and his company.
            THe men of the towne of Sluſe were ſore
abaſſhed when they harde of thoſe tydynges
ſo that they wyſt not what to do other
to gyue vp theyr towne and forſake all or elles
to entre in to the ſhyppes that laye there and ſo
defende the hauen / ſurely yf the Englyſſhmen
had knowen the caſe they were in / they had ben
lordes of the towne and of the caſtel or yf they
had byleued Peter du Boys / for he ſore counſayled
them that they ſholde incontynent haue
ſet on the towne of Sluſe / they had wonne it
yf they had ſoo done / but the englyſſhmen had
no courage therto but ſayd it were a grete foly
for vs to entre in to ye towne of Sluſe / for then
they of Bruges / of Dan / and of Ardenbourge
ſhall come and beſyege vs / & ſo peraduenture
ſhall leſe al that we haue wonne / it is better for
vs to kepe it and to make wyſe warre then folyſſhly
to leſe all / thus the englyſſhmen kepte
ſtyll the ſee but they determyned to brenne the
nauye of ſhyppes yt lay at ancre in the hauen of
Sluſe / of ſuche ſhyppes as they hadde wonne
they toke parte of thē ſuche as were moſt olde
and drye and lyghteſt and greſed them wel bothe
within and without and ſet fyer on them &
ſo lete them go with the wynde and with ye tyde
in to the hauen to ye entente that they ſholde
haue faſtened and ſet fyer on other ſhyppes yt

as god wolde that fyer dyd noo hurte nor

whiche he founde in ſmall defence / for yf the englyſſhmen

dyd on the other ſyde of the water they had taken
at theyr eaſe the caſtell & all the towne / for
ſuche as ſholde haue defended the towne were

to haue ben comforted by kynge Iohn of

lay in ye towne of Valcolyue or elles they wolde
neuer haue endured ſoo longe / for I haue
meruayle howe ſuche a ſorte of vyllaynes coulde

this is all that we knowe / thus they were all

            ABoute a .iiii. dayes after that Iohn̄ holande
and ſyr Thomas Percy were to

with ſtrenthe of men whyther they lyſt
and within it myght eaſely be a. C. knightes &
a. C. archers / & they had fylled ye dykes where
as this engyne ſholde paſſe / then began the aſſaulte / 
and the engyne to approche with ſtrength
of men and therin archers well prouyded
wt arowes fyerſly ſhotynge at them within the

wt mantelles & oxe hydes to defende thē fro
ye ſtones & dartes & vnder yt couerture men of

armes approched well paueſſed wt pyke axes
to perſe the walle / ſoo that they enpayred the

togyder that none durſte appere at theyr defence
ſo with hewynge they reuerſed in to the
dyke a grete pane of the wall / when they with
in ſawe themſelfe in ſoo grete myſchefe / they
were gretely abaſſhed / and then cryed out a
lowde we yelde ourſelfe / we yelde vs / but there
were noone that made them ony anſwere / 
The Englyſſhe men dyd laughe at them and
ſayd. Theſe vyllaynes haue put vs to moche
payne
                  •
                & nowe they mocke vs when they wolde
haue vs to take them to mercy / nowe ye towne
is our owne / ſome of the Englyſſhe men anſwered

not what ye ſay / we can not ſpeke no Spanyſſhe / 
ſpeke good frenſſhe or englyſſhe yf ye

               red and paſſed forthe and chaſed theſe
vyllaynes / who fledde before them and ſlewe
them by hepes. That daye there were ſlayne
what of one and other with the Iewes yt were

of Rybadane was taken by force / and ſuche as
fyrſt entred had there grete pyllage / and ſpecyally
they founde more golde and ſyluer in the
Iewes howſes then in ony other place.
            AFter the takynge of Rybadane whiche
was wonne by pure aſſaulte / and that
the Englyſſhe men had pylled it at theyr pleaſure
then they demaunded of ye marſhall what
ſholde be done with the towne yf it ſholde be
brente or not / naye ſayd the marſhall we wyll
kepe it and newe repayre it. But nowe whether
ſhall we prepayre / and they determyned
to drawe to Maures a good towne in Galyce
Then they were apoynted that ſholde abyde
in Rybadane and repayre it / there was lefte
ſyr Peter of clynton a ryght valyaunt knyght
with .xx. ſperes & .lx. archers / they made grete
prouyſyon with that they founde there ſpecyally
of yokes and good wynes / whiche were
ſo ſtronge and myghty that the englyſſhe men
coulde not drynke therof if they dranke moche
they were in that caſe they coulde not helpe
themſelfe in two dayes after. Thus they dyſlodged
fro Rybadane and rode towardes the
towne of Maures / and caryed in peces with
them y• grete engyne / for they ſawe well it dyd
good ſeruyce / and was ferefull to men in the
townes. When they of Maures vnderſtode
howe the englyſſhmen were comynge to them
warde to haue the towne vnder the duke and
duches of Lancaſtres obeyſaunce / and knewe
howe Rybadane was taken by force / and how
that they brought with them a deuyll in ſtede
of an engyne / for it was ſo grete that it coulde
not be dyſtroyed / they doubted gretly the ooſt
and this engyne / then they wente to counſayle
to ſe what were beſt for them to doo outher to
yelde or to make defence. And when they had
well counſayled togyder / they coulde ſe none
other thynge but yt it was farre better for them
to yelde then to defende / for they conſydered yf
they were taken by force / they ſholde leſe body
and goodes / and no comforte appered to them
fro ony parte / they that were ſage ſayd. Syrs
beholde howe they of Rybadane were taken
at theyr defence / and yet they were as ſtronge
as we or ſtronger / & they were beſyeged more
then a moneth / and yet they hadde nother ayde
nor ſocoure / as we vnderſtande the kynge of
Caſtel accompteth at this ſeaſon al ye countrey
of Galyce loſt to the ryuer of Dorne / nor we
thynke that this yere there cometh no frenſſhe
men to our ayde / wherfore let vs yelde ourſelfe
mekely without domage as other townes
haue done / euery man behelde the ſame oppynyon / 
but ſome ſayd howe maye this be done / 
well ynoughe ſayd the ſages / we ſhall go and
mete them on the waye and bere the keyes of ye
towne with vs & preſent them to the englyſſhe
men / they be courtoys people / they wyll do vs
no hurte yf we receyue them curtoyſly / to this
they were all agreed / then there yſſued out of
ye towne a fyfty perſones of them yt were mooſt
noble as ſoone as they knewe yt the englyſſhe
men approched they yſſued out / and aboute a
quarter of a legge of / they taryed for the Enghyſſhe
men:
            TIdynges came to the Englyſſhe men
howe they of the towne of Maures we
re yſſued out / not to fyght but to yelde them &
the keyes of the towne whiche they brought wt
them. Then ye lordes rode on before to ſe what
the matter was / and cauſed all the archers &
ooſt to tary behynde / then the Galycyens came
forthe / and it was ſayd to them / Syrs beholde
here the lordes of Englande ſente by the duke
of Lancaſtre to conquere this countrey / ſpeke
to them yf ye lyſt. Then they all kneled downe
& ſayd. Syrs we be of the poore men of Maures
who
                  •
               wyllyngly wyll be vnder the obeyſaū
               ce
of the duke of Lancaſtre and of my lady the

duke of Lancaſtre and of my lady the duches / 
wherfore we deſyre you to accepte vs to mercy
for all that we haue is yours / the .iii. lordes of
englande by eche others aduyſe anſwered and
ſayd / ye good people of Maures we ſhall go wt
you in to the towne and parte of

               ur ooſt not al
and there ye ſhal make promyſe & othe as good
people ought to do to theyr lorde and lady / ſyrs
ſayd they this ſhall we doo with good wylles.
Then ſayd the lordes go your wayes on before
and open the gates / for ye are and ſhall be receyued
to mercy / then they wente to theyr towne
and opened theyr gates and barryers and
ſuffred the conſtable and the other lordes to entre
and a .iiii. C. ſperes with them / and the reſydue
of the ooſt lodged without in the feldes &
had prouyſyon out of the towne ſuffycyent / the
lordes lodged within the towne and toke the
othes of them of the towne of Maures as it is
ſayd before.

it is neceſſary that ye go and ſpeke with ye

the erle of Foyze is ſo grete and myghty that yf
he lyſt we gete noo paſſage thrughe his countrey / 
then we muſt paſſe thrughe Aragon / whiche
is farre of I can not tell why the erle maketh
ſuche doubtes nor why he ſoo fortefyeth his

agaynſt you nor agaynſt ony man yt wyl peaſybly
paſſe and pay to my people for that they take / 
whiche fredome I haue ſworne to kepe / & to

ſyr may this ſuffyſe and content you
Then ye erle ſayd / ſyr Gaultyer yf this be done

            Syr ſayd the erle curſed be ye warre bytwene
Portyngale & Caſtel / I ought gretly
to complayne of it / for I neuer loſt ſo moche as
I dyd at one ſeaſon in ye warre bytwene thoſe
two royalmes / for all my chefe men of warre of
Byerne were there ſlayne / and yet I ſhewed
them or they wente that they ſholde make theyr
warre wyſely / for I ſayd the Portyngales were
harde men to mete withall and cruell of dedes / 
yf they haue the ouer hande of theyr enemyes / 
they haue no mercy / ſyr Gaultyer I ſpeke it
that when ye and your companyon come in to
Caſtell ſyth ye two be the chefe capytaynes of
them that are paſſed and ſhall paſſe / and peraduenture
ye ſhall be requyred by the kynge of
Caſtell to gyue your counſayle and aduyſe / be
wel aduyſed that ye gyue not to haſty coūſayle
to aduaunce to fyght with your aduerſaryes / 
ye duke of Lancaſtre / the kynge of Portyngale
the Englyſſhe men or the Portyngales / for all
theſe be famylyer togyder and be all as one / &
the englyſſhe men deſyre to haue batayle by .ii.
reaſons / one is of a grete ſeaſon they haue had
noo profyte / they be poore and haue wonne nothynge
of a longe tyme but rather ſpende and
haue loſt. Wherfore they wyll be redy to auaunce
themſelfe in hope to gete ſome newe profyte / 
and ſuche people as be aduenturers deſyrynge
other mennes goodes wyll fyght with a hardy
courage and often tymes fortune ſerueth them
well / the other reaſon is / the duke of Lancaſtre
knoweth ſurely that he can not come parfytely
nor peaſybly to the herytage of Caſtell whiche
he demaundeth to haue by the ryght of his wyfe
whom he calleth ryghtfull enherytoure / but
all onely by batayle / for he knoweth well yf he
myght haue and obteyne one iourney agaynſt
the kynge of Caſtell that all the countrey then
wolde yelde to hym and trymble before hym / &
for this entente he is come in to Galyce and hath
gyuen one of his doughters in maryage to
the kynge of Portyngale to the entente that he
ſholde ayde his quarell / and ſyrs I ſaye this to
you / for if the matter ſholde fall otherwyſe then
well ye and your felowe ſhall bere more blame
then ony other. Syr ſayd ſyr Gaultyer I thanke
you of your good aduertyſement and ſyr my
ſeruyce ſhall be redy to doo you pleaſure / for at
this day ye be amonge other cryſten prynces reputed
for one of the mooſt ſageſt and happeſt
in all your aduentures / but ſyr my companyon
and I haue one aboue vs who is chefe ſouerayne
of all our company that is the duke of Borbon / 
and tyll he be come in to Caſtell we ſhall
make no haſt to fyght with our enemyes what
ſoeuer ony man ſaye / ſo they entred in to other
talkynge tyll the erle of Foyze demaunded for
wyne. Then they dranke and ſoo toke leue / the
erle entred in to his chambre and ſyr Gaultyer
retourned to his lodgynge well accompanyed
with the erles knyghtes & ſo ſupped togyder.
            THe nexte day after dyner yr Gaultyer
toke his leue of the erle of Foyze / and be
ſyde other thynges the erle gaue hyym a fayre
courſer and a mule / ſyr Gaultyer thanked the
erle & ſo departed out of Ortays & lay / the ſame
nyght at Ercyell and the nexte nyght at Tarbe
he rode that daye a grete iourney / and then he
determyned to ſende fro thens to ſyr Wyllyam
of Lygnac / and ſoo he dyd aduertyſynge hym
howe he had ſpedde with the erle of Foyze / and
deſyrynge hym to come on forwarde with all
theyr companyes and ſhewynge hym howe the
countrey of Byerne and all the good townes
ſholde be open / payenge trewely for that they
take or elles not. ¶This meſſagere dydde ſoo
moche that he came to Thoulouſe and dydde

when ſyr wyllyam hadde redde the contynewe
hereof he made it to be knowen to all his company

that they ſholde ſet on forwarde / ſoo that
as ſoone as they entred ony parte of the erle of
Foyze lande to pay for euery thynge that they
ſholde take / elles theyr capytaynes to anſwere
for euery thynge / this was cryed by the ſounde
of a trompet fro lodgynge to lodgynge / to the

euery man dyſlodged out of ye marches of Tholouſe / 
Carcaſſone / Lymous / and of Marbon / 
and ſo entred in to Bygore / and ſyr Wyllyam
of Lygnac toke his hors and rode to Tarbe to

englande / & when they vnderſtode of ye paſſage
of theſe frenſſhmen thrugh theyr countrey they
were in doubte of ouer rynnynge / brennynge &
exylynge / for as then there were no men of war
of theyr partye in all that countrey to defende
theyr fronters / the ſage men drewe togyder &
ſente to trete with the frenſſhe capytaynes and
to bye theyr peas / then they ſent to Ortays .iiii.
men hauynge auctoryte to make theyr peas.
Theſe .iiii. men met by the way with a ſquyer
of the erle of Foyze called Ernalton du Pyn / &
ſhewed hym all theyr matter deſyrynge hym to

to Ortays whiche ſholde be within .iii. or .iiii.
dayes after / and to helpe to ayde to make theyr
peas / & he anſwered that he wolde do ſo with a
good wyll. The nyght that the capytaynes came
to Ortays they were lodged at ye ſame ſquyers
houſe / and there he ayded them of Byſquey
to make theyr apoyntment / and they to pay .ii.M.
frankes and theyr countrey ſaued fro brennynge
and robbynge / the erle of Foyze gaue a

paſſed to Sameterre and entred in to the countrey
of Byſquey whiche was redemed / they toke
vytayles where as they myght gete it / and
ſo paſſed thrughe the countrey without doyng

            ¶Howe ſyr Iohn̄ Holande and ſyr
Raynolde de Roy fought togyder
in lyſtes before the duke of Lancaſtre
in the towne of Beſances.
Ca. lxxviii.
            
               Here before ye haue herde
howe the towne of Beſa
                  •
               ces
was put in compoſycyon
with ye duke of Lancaſtre
and howe it was yelden
vp to hym / for ye kynge
of Caſtell dyd comforte it
nothynge / and howe ye duches
of Lancaſtre and her doughter came to ye
cyte of Porte in Portyngale to ſe the kynge &
the quene there / and howe the kynge and ye lordes
there receyued them ioyfully as it was reaſon / 
and thus whyle the duke of Lancaſtre ſoiourned
in the towne of Beſances tydynges came
thyder fro Valeolyue brought by an heraulde
of fraunce who demaunded where was the
lodgynge of ſyr Iohn̄ Holande / and ſo he was
brought thyder / then he kneled downe before
hym and delyuered hym a letter and ſayd / ſyr I
am an offycer of armes ſent hyder to you fro ſyr
Raynolde du Roy who ſaluteth you / yf it pleaſe
you to rede your letter / then ſyr Iohn̄ ſayd wt
ryght a good wyll / and thou arte ryght welcome
and opened his letter and redde it wherin
was conteyned howe ſyr Raynolde du Roy deſyred
hym in the way of amours and for the loue
of his lady to delyuer hym of his chalenge / 
iii. courſes with a ſpere .iii. ſtrokes wt a ſworde
iii. with a dagger and .iii. with an axe / & that if
it wolde pleaſe hym to come to Valeolyue he
wolde prouyde for hym & .lx. horſe a ſure ſaufcō
               duyte
yf not he wolde come to Beſances with
.xxx. horſes ſo that he wolde gete for hym a ſaufcondyte
of the duke of Lancanſtre / When ſyr
Iohn̄ Holande had red theſe letters he began
to ſmyle & behelde the heraulde & ſayd / frende yu
arte welcome / thou haſt brought me tydynges
yt pleaſeth me ryght wel / & I accepte his deſyre
yu ſhalte obyde here in my houſe wt my company
& to morowe yu ſhalte haue anſwere where our
armes ſhal be accomplyſſhed outher in Galyce
or in Caſtell / ſyr ſayd ye heraulde as it pleaſeth
god & you. ¶The heraulde was there at his
eaſe / and ſyr Iohn̄ / wente to the duke and founde
hym talkynge with the marſhall / then he ſhewed
them his tydynges and the letters / Well
ſayd the duke / and haue ye accepted his deſyre

ye truely ſyr ſayd he / and I deſyre nothynge ſo
moche as dedes of armes / and the knyght hath
deſyred me / but nowe ſyr where ſhall it be your
pleaſure that we doo our armes / the duke ſtudyed
a lytell and then ſayd / I wyll that they be
done in this towne / make a ſaufconduyte for
hym as it ſhall pleaſe you and I ſhall ſeale it.
In the name of god ſayd ſyr Iohn̄ that is well
ſayd / the ſaufcondyte was wryten for hym &
.xxx. knyghtes and ſquyers to come ſaufe and
go ſaufe / then ſyr Iohn̄ Holande delyuered it
to the heraulde and gaue hym a mantell furred
with myneuer and .xii. aungell nobles. The heraulde
toke his leue and retourned to Valeolyue
to his mayſter and there ſhewed howe he
had ſped and delyuered the ſaufconduyte / on ye
other parte tydynges came to the cyte of Porte
to the kynge of Portyngale and to the ladyes
there howe that theſe dedes of armes ſholde be
done at Beſances / Well ſayd the kynge I wyll
be therat and the quene my wyfe with other ladyes
and damoyſelles / & the duches of Lancaſtre
who was as then there thanked the kynge
in that ſhe ſholde at her retourne be accompanyed
with the kynge and with ye quene / it was
not longe after but the tyme approched. Then
the kynge of Portyngale / the quene / the duches
and her other doughter with other ladyes and
damoyſelles rode 
                  •
               orth in grete aray towarde
Beſances / & when the duke of Lancaſtre knew
that ye kynge came thyder he toke his hors and
many other lordes and yſſued out of Beſances
and met the kynge and ye ladyes / there ye kynge
and the duke made grete chere togyder / and ſo
entred togyder in to ye towne & theyr lodgynge
appoynted as it aperteyned accordynge to the
maner of ye countrey / and that was not ſo eaſye
nor large as thoughe they had ben at Parys.
            ABoute a .iii. dayes after that the kynge
of Portyngale was come to Beſances
thyder came ſyr Reynolde du Roy well accompanyed
with knyghtes and ſquyers he hadde a
vi. ſcore horſes / and they were all well lodged / 
for the duke of Lancaſte hadde prepayred redy
theyr lodgynges. Then ye nexte daye ſyr Iohn̄
Holande & ſyr Raynolde Roy were armed and
mounted on theyr horſes & ſoo came to a fayre
place redy ſan
                  •
               ed where they ſholde doo theyr
armes / and ſcafoldes redy made for the kynge
& for the ladyes / & for the duke & other lordes of
englande / for they were all come thyder to ſe ye
dedes of armes of theſe .ii. knyghtes / they came
in to the felde as well appoynted as coulde be
deuyſed / & there was brought in theyr ſperes / 
theyr axes and theyr ſwordes and well horſed / 
and ſo eche of them a good dyſtaunce fro other
made theyr tournes & fryſkes freſſhly / for they
knewe well they were regarded / euery thynge
was ordeyned at theyr deſyre and all theyr armes
graunted excepte the vtteraunce / howbeit
no man knewe what ſholde fal of theyr bodyes
for ſyth they were thyder come they muſt nedes
mete at ye poynte of theyr ſperes / and after that
with theyr ſwordes / and then with axes & daggers / 
loo what daunger they were in to the entente
to exhaulte theyr honoure / for theyr lyues
lay but in the myſaduenture of one ſtroke / thus
they ranne togyder and met as euen as thoughe
they hadde rynne by a lyne and ſtrake eche
other in the vyſoure of theyr helmes ſo that ſyr
Raynolde du Roy brake his ſpere in .iiii. peces
and ye ſheuers flewe a grete hyght in to ye ayre / 
whiche courſe was gretely prayſed / ſyr Iohn̄
Holande ſtrake ſyr Raynolde in lykewyſe in ye
vyſoure but the ſtroke was of no force / I ſhall
ſhewe you why / ſyr Raynolde had the vyſoure
of his helme made at auaūtage for it was tyed
but with a ſmall laſe / the laſe 
                  •
               rake with y• ſtroke
& the helme flewe of his heed ſo that the knyght
was bare heeded / and ſo paſſed forth theyr
courſe / and ſyr Iohn̄ dyſcharged and bare his
ſtaffe freſſhely / then euery man ſayd it was a
goodly courſe.
            THen theſe knyghtes retourned to theyr
owne places and ſyr Raynolde was helmed
agayne and had a newe ſpere / and ſo they
ranne togyder agayne they were bothe wel horſed
and coulde well guyde thē / they ſtrake eche
other on the helmes ſo that the fyer flewe out / ye
ſperes brake not / but ſyr raynoldes helme agayne
flewe of his heed. A ſayd the Englyſſhmen ye
frenſſheman hath auauntage / Why is not his
helme as faſt bocled as ſyr Iohn̄ of Holandes
is / we thynke he dothe wronge / let hym ſet his
helme in lyke caſe as his companyon hathe done
his / holde your peas ſyrs ſayd the duke of
Lancaſtre / let them dele in armes / let euery mā
take his aduauntage as he thynketh beſt / yf ſyr
Iohn̄ Holande thynke yt the other knyght haue
aduauntage let hym ſet on his helme in lyke
maner / but as for me ſayd the duke and I were
in lyke armes as theſe .ii. knyghtes be I wolde
haue my helme as faſt bocled as I coulde / and
I thynke here be many of the ſame oppynyon.
then the englyſſhe men ſpake no moo wordes / 
and the ladyes and damoyſelles ſayd howe the
knyghtes had iuſted well and goodly / and the

kynge of Portyngale ſayd the ſame and ſpake
to ſyr Iohn̄ Ferant and ſayd / ſyr Iohn̄ in our
countrey knyghtes iuſt not in this goodly maner / 
ſyr ſayd he theſe knyghtes do iuſt wel / and
ſyr I haue ſene or this ye frenſſhmen iuſt before
ye kynge your broder when we were at Elyres
agaynſt the kynge of Caſtell / lyke iuſtes I ſawe
there bytwene ſyr wyllyam Wyndſore and
another frenſſhe knyght / but theyr helmes were
faſter tyed then this knyghtes helme is / then
the kynge regarded agayne the two knyghtes
to ſe theyr thyrde courſe.
            THus they ranne togyder ye thyrde courſe
and regarded eche other wyſely to take
theyr aduauntage / they myght well ſo doo / 
for theyr horſes ſerued them at theyr wyſſhyng
and ſo they ſtrake eche other agayne on the helme
in ſuche wyſe yt theyr eyen trimbled in theyr
heedes and theyr ſta
                  •
               es brake / and agayne ſyr
Raynoldes helme flewe of his heed and ſo eche
other paſſed forth theyr courſe and demeaned
themſelfe freſſhly / ſo that euery man ſayd howe
they had nobly iuſted / but the englyſſhmen blamed
gretely ſyr Raynolde du Roy in that his
helme was no faſter ſet on his heed / but the duke
of Lancaſtre blamed hym nothyng but ſayd
I thynke hym wyſe that can in feates of armes
ſeke his lawfull aduauntage / it ſemeth well yt
ſyr Raynolde is not to lerne to iuſt / he knoweth
more therin then ſyr Iohn̄ doth / thoughe he
haue borne hymſelfe ryght well. So thus after
theyr courſes with theyr ſperes they toke theyr
axes and dyd theyr armes with them and gaue
eche other .iii. grete ſtrokes on theyr helmes / &
then they fought with theyr ſwordes and after
with theyr daggers / & when all was done there
was none of them hurte. The frenſſhmen brought
ſyr Raynolde to his lodgynge / and the Englyſſhmen
ſyr Iohn̄ Holande to his / the ſame
day the duke of Lancaſtre made a dyner to all
the frenſſhmen in his lodgynge and the duches
ſet at the table by the duke / and ſyr Raynolde
du Roy bynethe her / after dyner they wente in
to a counſayle chambre / and ye duches toke ſyr
Raynolde by the hande and made hym to entre
as ſone as herſelfe / and there ſhe comoned with
hym and other of the frenſſhe knyghtes tyll it
was tyme to call for drynke / then ye duches ſayd
to the frenſſhe knyghtes / ſyrs I haue meruayle
of you / that ye do ſuſteyne ye wronge oppynyon
of a baſtarde / for ye knowe well and ſoo dothe
all the worlde that Henry that was ſomtyme
called kynge of Caſtel was a baſtarde / therfore
what iuſt cauſe haue you to ſuſteyne that quarell / 
and ayde to your power to dyſheryte the
ryght ayre of Caſtell / for I knowe well and ſoo
dothe all the worlde that I and my ſyſter were
doughters by lawfull maryage to kyng Peter
Wherfore god knoweth what ryght we haue
to the royalme of Caſtell / & the good lady whē
ſhe ſpake of her fader ſhe wepte / then ſyr Raynolde
du Roy made his obeyſaunce and ſayd.
Madame we knowe ryght well that all is of
trouth that ye haue ſayd / howbeit ye kynge our
mayſter is of the contrary oppynyon agaynſt
you / and we be his ſubiectes and muſt make
warre at his pleaſure / and go where as he wyl
ſende vs / We maye not ſay nay. So the duches
departed to the duke / and ye frenſſhe knyghtes
dranke and then toke theyr leues / and wente to
theyr lodgynge / and there euery thynge was redy
to departe / and then they mounted and departed
fro Beſances and rode the ſame daye to
Noy / and there they reſted / and then rode forth
tyll they came to Valeolyue.
         
         
            ¶Howe the kynge of Portyngale
and the duke of Lancaſtre determyned
to entre in to the royalme
of Caſtell. Ca. lxxix.
            
               AFter theſe dedes of armes
done as I haue recorded
The kynge of Portyngale &
the duke of Laucaſtre toke
counſayle togyder and determyned
to ryde and to entre
in to Caſtell within a ſhorte
ſpace / and that the kynge of Portyngale with
all his power ſholde ryde on the fronters and
ſo to entre in to Caſtell / and the duke and his
rowte to entre on the boundes of Galyce and to
conquere ſuche townes and fortreſſes as were
agaynſt hym / and yf Iohn̄ of Caſtell dyd aſſemble
his ooſt agaynſt them to make batayle / thē
bothe theyr ooſtes to drawe togyder / It was
thought mooſt neceſſary to haue theyr ooſtes a
ſondre tyll nede were rather then togyder / to exchewe
ſykenes yt myght fall & to haue the more
eaſyer lodgynge and foragynge in exchewyng
of debates & dyſcordes / for englyſſhmen be haſty
& prowde in ye felde / & the Portyngales hote
& dyſdaynful & can not ſuſtre / but it was thought
yt in a grete iourney of batayle they ſholde
ryght wel agree togyder / this coūſayle was determyned
& the kynge ſayd to the duke / ſyr as

ſoone as I haue knowledge that ye ſet forwarde
I ſhall doo in lyke caſe for I and my men be
redy / & they deſyre nothynge elles but batayle / 
ſyr ſayd the duke and I ſhall not longe ſyr ſtyll
it is ſhewed me howe as yet there be certayne
townes in Galyce yt rebell agaynſt vs / I wyll
goo and vyſyte them / and after that I wyll
ſeke out for our enemyes / wherſoeuer I can fynde
them. Thus the kynge of Portyngale toke
leue of the duke and duches / and in lyke wyſe
ſo dyd the quene Phelyp and her yonge ſyſter
katheryne for it was ordeyned that the yonge
lady ſholde abyde al the warre ſeaſon with her
ſyſter the quene at the cyte of Porte in Portyngale / 
it was thought ſhe coulde be in ony better
kepynge / and ye duches retourned to ſaynt
Iaques in Galyce / ſo thus euery body departed
thyder as they ſholde doo / the kynge to the
cyte of Porte / and the duches to the towne of
ſaynt Iaques well accompanyed with knyghtes
and ſquyers / and the duke taryed at Beſances
and there aboute / and prepayred ſhortly to
ſet forwarde / he was deſyrous to departe bycauſe
it was in the ioly luſty moneth of Aprell
at whiche ſeaſon in Galyce the graſſe is full
growen and all theyr corne and herbes floures
and fruytes redy rype the countrey is ſo hote yt
in the begynnynge of Iune harueſt is paſt / the
duke thought the ſeaſon goodly to ſet forwarde
his army. ¶Nowe let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of
the orderynge of the frenſſhmen and of kynge
Iohn̄ of Caſtell as well as we haue done of the
englyſſhe men.
         
         
            ¶Howe ſyr Wyllyam of Lygnac / &
ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac came to the
ayde of kynge Iohn̄ of Caſtell.
Ca. lxxx.
            
               HEre before ye haue
herde howe ſyr Wyllyam
of Lygnac & ſyr Gaultyer
of Paſſac dyd ſo moche by
theyr wyſe entreatynge of
the erle of Foyze yt he ſuffred
them peaſybly to paſſe
thrughe his countrey of Byerne to go in to Caſtel
and beſyde that the erle gaue them grete rewardes / 
for there were noo knyghtes nor ſquyers
ſtraungers that came to ſe hym / but that he
wolde largely rewarde them accordynge to
theyr degrees / to ſome a .C. floreynes / to ſome
CC. floreynes and .xxx. or .xl. ſo that this ſayd
fyrſt paſſage of the Frenſſhe men coſt the erle of
Foyze as his owne treaſourer ſhewed me the
ſome of a .M. frankes beſyde horſes and other
thynges that he gaue / to ſay trouth ſurely it is
grete domage yt ſuche a perſone ſholde be olde

pyl the people / ſurely he had none ſuche aboute
hym 
                  •
                he dyd euery thynge on his owne mynde / 
for naturally he had grete wyſdome and coulde
gyue where nede was and take as it became
hym beſt and by reaſan of his larges and grete
expences ſomtyme he trauayled his ſubiectes / 
for his reuenewes were not ſuffycyent to bere
out his gyftes whiche were yerely .lx.M. frankes / 
ye whiche lyke haue not ben ſene nor herde
of ony other / yet he aſſembled his treaſoure for
doubte of all aduentures in .xxx. yere .xxx. tymes
a .C.M. frankes / and yet for all that his
people alwayes prayde to god for his longe lyfe / 
and I herde it reported howe when he dyed
there were in Foyze and in Byerne .x.M. perſones
that ſayd yt they wolde gladly haue dyed
with hym wherby it is to be thought that they
ſayd not ſo without it had ben for grete loue yt
they had to theyr lorde / and ſurely if they loued
hym they dyd but ryght and accordynge to reaſon / 
for he alwayes maynteyned them in theyr

                  •
               
               des
and the people therin had as grete lyberte
and frauncheſſe and lyued in as good peas as
thoughe they had ben in paradyſe terreſtre / I
ſay not this for flattery nor for fauour nor loue
that I bere hym nor for the gyftes that he hath
gyuen me / but I can well proue all that I haue
ſayd / for I am ſure there be a .M. knyghtes &
ſquyers wyll ſaye the ſame.
            NOwe let vs retourne to ſyr Wyllyam of
Lygnac and to ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac
who were capytaynes and ſouerayne leders of
all the frenſſhe armye / when they were paſſed
the countrey of Byſquey and the paſe of Rounceuall / 
whiche coſt them .iii. dayes a paſſynge.
The mountaynes were ſo full of ſnowe for all
that it was in the moneth of Aprell / yet they
and theyr horſes hadde moche payne to paſſe
thrughe. Then they came towardes Panpylona / 
and there they founde the royalme of Nauare
redy open for to ſuffre them to paſſe thrughe.
For the kynge of Nauare wolde not doo

no dyſpleaſure to the kynge of Caſtell bycauſe
his ſone ſyr Charles of Nauare had to his wyfe
as then the kynge of Caſtelles ſyſter / & when
the peas was made bytwene kynge Henry and
the fader of kynge Iohn̄ of Nauare they made
and promyſed grete alyaunce togyder whiche
they longe kepte / for the kynge of Nauare was
not able to reſyſt the kynge of Caſtell without
he had grete alyaunce and comforte of ye kynge
ſo Aragon / or elles of ye kynge of englande.
            THeſe capytaynes of Fraunce came to
Pampylona where the kynge of Nauare
was who receyued them ioyfully & made
them to dyne with hym in his palays after dyner
he led them in to his chambre and there comoned
wt them of dyuers thynges / for ye kynge
there was a wyſe man and a ſubtell & well langaged / 
and amonge other thynges he ſhewed
them howe ye frenſſhe kynge and his counſayle
had ben dyſpleaſed with hym without a cauſe / 
and wrongfully had taken fro hym his herytage
and landes in Normandy whiche he ought
to haue by ſucceſſyon of his predeceſſours kynges
of fraunce and of Nauare whiche he ſayd
he coulde not forgete ſeynge he had taken fro
hym in Normandy / Languedoc / and in the barony
of Mountpellyer the ſome of .lx.M. frankes
of yerely reuenues and he ſayd he wyſt not
to whome to complayne to haue ryght / but all
onely to god / ſyrs ſayd the kyng I ſay not this
to you bycauſe ye ſholde addreſſe my wronges
for I knowe well it lyeth not in your power / 
for I thynke the frenſſhe kynge wyll do but lytell
for you in that behalfe / for ye be none of his
counſayle / ye be but knyghtes aduentures and
ſowdyours to go where ſoeuer he ſende you.
            But I ſpeke this in maner of complaynte to al
knyghtes in Fraunce that paſſe by me / then ſyr
Gaultyer of Paſſac ſayd / ſyr your wordes be
true yf that you ſaye that our kynge for all vs
wyll nother gyue nor take / for ſurely ſyr we be
not of his counſayle but redy to go where as he
wyll ſende vs / but ſyr the duke of Borbon who
is our ſouerayne capytayne and vncle to our
kynge cometh after vs this ſame waye / outher
goynge or retournynge ye maye ſhewe hym
your buſynes / by hym ye maye be addreſſed of
all your complayntes / and ſyr we praye to god
that he may rewarde you of the honour that ye
haue done to vs / & ſyr we ſhall ſhewe your curtoyſye
to our kyng & to his counſayle when we
retourne in to fraunce / and alſo to the duke of
Borbone who is our chefe capytayne whome
we truſt to ſe or we ſe the kyng / and then wyne
was brought and they dranke & toke theyr leue
of the kynge / and ye kynge rewarded them largely
and ſente to eche of them to theyr lodgyng
goodly horſes wherof they had grete ioye.
            THus theſe men of warre paſſed thrugh
the royalme of Nauare & came to Groyne / 
& there demaunded where they ſholde fynde
the kynge of Caſtell / and it was ſhewed them
howe he had lyen at Valeolyue a grete ſeaſon / 
but as then they ſayd they thought he was at
Burgus in Spayne there makynge his prouyſyon / 
then they toke the way to Burgus and
lefte the way to Galyce / for that waye was not
ſure for them / for the Englyſſhe men were ſore
abrode in the countrey. Tydynges came to the
kynge of Caſtell howe ſocoures came to hym
out of fraunce to the nombre of .ii.M. ſperes / 
wherof he was ryght glad and ſo departed fro
Valeolyue and rode to Burgus with a .vi.M
hors. Thus theſe frenſſhmen of armes came to
Burgus and lodged theraboute abrode in the
countrey / and dayly thyder came men of warre
And ſyr wyllyam of Lygnac / and ſyr Gaultyer
of Paſſac came to the kynge in to his palays / 
who receyued them ſwetely and thanked them
of the payne and grete trauayle that they had
taken for his ſake as to come thyder to ſerue
hym. The knyghtes made theyr reuerence and
ſayd / ſyr yf we maye do you ony ſeruyce to pleaſe
you / our paynes ſhall ſoone be forgoten / but
ſyr & it pleaſe you to take aduyſe howe we ſhal
do / outher to ryde agaynſt our enemyes or elles
to make them warre by garyſons tyll ſuche
ſeaſon as the duke of Borbon be come / and ſyr
yf it pleaſe you ye maye ſende for ſyr Olyuer of
Clyſquy we knowe well he is in his countrey
and for ſyr Peter of Vyllaynes / the Barroys
of Barres / Chatell Morant and the other companyons
who haue haunted this countrey more
then we haue done / for they were here longe
before vs / and then let vs al counſayle togyder
and with goddes grace you and your royalme
ſhal haue honoure and profyte. Syrs ſayd the
kynge ye ſpeke wyſely and thus ſhal it be done
Then clerkes were ſet a worke and letters made
and meſſagers ſent forthe in to dyuers places
to the knyghtes and men of warre there as
they were ſpred abrode in the countrey / & when
they knewe that ſyr Wyllyam of Lygnac and
ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac were at Burgus with

the kynge they were gretely reioyced therof / 
then theſe knyghtes and other companyons departed
fro theyr garyſons and lefte them in ſure
kepynge / and ſo rode to Burgus in ſpayne / 
ſoo that there was a grete nombre of Frenſſhe
men of warre.
            THen the kynge of Caſtel and his lordes
& knyghtes of fraunce went to coūſayle
togyder to ſe how they ſholde maynteyne theyr
warre / for they knewe well theyr enemyes rode
abrode and kepte ye feldes / wherfore they thought
to prouyde ſome remedy to the honoure of
the kynge and profyte of the royalme of Caſtell
So there were many matters debated in this
counſayle / and then all theyr people were nombred / 
and it was ſayd that of the royalme ſelfe
they myght well brynge togyder a .xxx.M. horſes
and the men well armed after the vſage of
Caſtell with dartes and Iauelyns / and foote
men caſtynge ſtones out of ſlynges other .xxx.M.
The frenſſhe knyghtes amonge themſelfe
conſydered al this and ſayd one to another this
is a grete nombre of people and they were good
men of warre / but they be lytel worth / for we haue
ſene ſuche ſlowfulnes in them that we haue
no grete truſt to them / as it appered as well in
the batayle of Marres where the prynce of Wales
had the vyctory as 
                  〈◊〉
                ye batayle of Iuberoth
where as the Portyngales and Gaſcoynes were / 
and alwaye the Spanyardes were dyſcomfyted.
Then the erle of Lune in ſuſteynynge ye
Caſtellyans & in exſcuſynge of them ſayd / ſyrs
as to the batayle of Marres I ſhall anſwere
you / it is of trouthe yt ſyr Bertram of Clyſquy
& a grete nombre of knyghtes of Fraunce were
there and fought valyauntly / for they were all
taken or ſlayne / but ye haue herde and ye know
well that agaynſt them was the floure of all the
chyualry of the worlde bothe in wyſdome valyauntnes
and prowes the whiche is not nowe
with the duke of La
                  •
               caſtre / the prynce at teh batayle
of Marres had .x.M. ſperes and .vi.M.
archers / they were ſuche men that there were a
iii.M. of them euery man worth a Rowlande
or an Olyuere / but the duke of Lancaſtre hathe
none ſuche / he paſſeth not a .xii. or a .xv.C. ſperes / 
and a .iiii.M. archers / and we be a. vi .M.
ſperes / nor we ſhall not fyght agaynſt Rowlande
nor Olyuer. Syr Iohn̄ Chandos / ſyr Thomas
Felton / ſyr Olyuer Clyſſon / ſyr Hughe
Caurel / ſyr Rycharde Pountchardon / ſyr Garſis / 
the lorde of Ryeux / and ſyr Rycharde Dangle
I coulde name .v.C. ſuche that were there / 
they be deed / we ſhall fynde none ſuche nowe / 
Wherfore the matter is not ſoo peryllous as it
was in tyme paſt / for yf ye wyll byleue me / we
ſhall go fyght with them and paſſe the ryuer of
Derne / it ſhall tourne vs to grete valyauntnes
The counſayle that the erle of Lune dyd gyue
was wel herde / and there were many that helde
ye ſame oppynyon / then ſyr Olyuer of Clyſquy
ſayd ſyr erle of Lune we knowe well all that ye
haue ſayd procedeth of your grete wyſdome &
valyauntnes / but ſyr take it ſo that we goo and
fyght with the duke of Lancaſtre / yf that were
all we ſholde do well ynoughe / but ſyr ye leue ye
gretteſt matter behynde / as the kynge of Portyngale
and his puyſſaūce / for as we be enfourmed
they be a .xxv.C. ſperes / & .xxx.M. of other
men of war / for on the truſt of the kynge of Portyngale
ye duke of Lancaſtre is entred in to Galyce
and they haue made a grete alyaunce togyder / 
for the kynge hath maryed the dukes doughter / 
nowe ſyr what ſaye you to this / in the name
of god ſayd the erle of Lune ye knyghtes of
Fraunce are ſuffycyent to fyght with the duke
of Lancaſtre / and the kynge of Caſtell and the
Caſtellyans who be as they ſay .xx.M. horſe / &
xxx .M. a foote / they may fyght with the kynge
of Portyngale I dare well abyde ye aduenture
amonge them / When the frenſſhmen ſawe how
the erle of Lune layde it ſo ſore to theyr charge
ſayd ſyr ye be in ye ryght and we be in ye wronge
for ſyr we ſholde haue ſayd as ye do / and ſyr let
it ſoo be and you wyll / there is none of vs ſhall
ſaye agaynſt your wyll / ſyrs ſayd the kynge I
requyre you all counſayle me truely and not in
haſt nor by pryde / but by ſad aduyſe and humylyte / 
and then let vs take the beſt waye / I wyll
not conclude to accepte this iourney / I wyl we
mete agayne togyder to morowe in this ſame
chambre / and ye ſyr Wyllyam of Lygnac and
ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac who are ſente hyder in
to this countrey by the frenſſhe kynge and by
the duke of Borbon / I requyre you go togyder
and take aduyſe and counſayle me to that ſhall
be thought mooſt beſt and honourable to me
and to my royalme / for it ſhall lye in you whether
we ſhall fyght with our enemyes or not / 
They made theyr reuerence and ſayd they wolde
obey his commaundement and ſo departed.
            THus euery man that daye departed to
theyr lodgynges and the frenſſhmen as
they were togyder had grete communycacyon
ſome ſayd we can not honourably fyght with

our enemyes tyll the duke of Borbon our ſouerayne
capytayne be come / We can not tell yf he
wolde fyght with them or not / be it ſoo that we
fyght with them and haue the vyctory / the duke
of Borbou wyll be ſore dyſpleaſed with vs and
ſpecyally with vs that be the frenſſhe capytaynes / 
and yf the fortune ſholde fall agaynſt vs / 
we ſholde then bothe loſe our bodyes and the
royalme / for yf we were ouerthrowen there were
no recouery in the Caſtellyans but that the
kynge of Caſtell were lyke to leſe all his royalme
for this tyme / and we ſholde bere more fawte
then ony other for it ſholde be layde howe we
had cauſed the batayle and gaue no good counſayle / 
nor alſo we be in noo ſuretye yf the royalme
be all ſure on the kynges partye or not / or
whether they haue couertly ſente for the duke
of Lancaſtre and his wyfe or not who is reputed
for heyre of Caſtell / for ſhe was doughter to
kynge Don Peter all the worlde knoweth that
ſo that when the people ſe the duke & his wyfe
with ye englyſſhmen in the felde demaundynge
the crowne of Caſtell affyrmynge how they haue
ryght therto / for kynge Iohn̄ who was kynge
as then was ſone to a baſtarde / then peraduenture
they may tourne to theyr parte as they
dyd in ye grete batayle of Maures / & ſoo ſholde
we abyde deed in the felde / ſo we thinke there is
double peryll bothe to the kynge and to vs / but
ſuche folyſſhe people gyue the kynge counſayle
to batayle and are herde before them that ſholde
ſpeke / well ſyrs ſayd ſyr wyllyam of Lygnac
and ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac to morowe ſhall be
knowen euery mannes opynyon. So that day
and nyght the frenſſhmen were at dyuers communycacyons / 
and in lyke wyſe ſoo were the
ſpanyardes / Suche as loued the kynge wolde
not counſayle hym to fyght for dyuers reaſons
one was if he fought and loſt the batayle he loſt
his royalme without recouery / the kynge hymſelfe
thought it not good to fyght / he fered ſore
the fortune of the warre / nor alſo he knewe not
euery mannes mynde who loued hym and who
dyd not. Thus the matter reſted tyll the nexte
daye then euery man retourned to the palays / 
and the kynge entred in to counſayle.
            IN this counſayle were many opynyons
for euery man to his power wolde truely
counſayle the kynge / dyuers counſayled hym
that he ſholde not enclyne haſtely to batayle / 
puttynge hym in remembraunce of the harde
iourney that he had at Iuberoth where as the
kynge of Portyngale dyſcomfyted hym / wherby
he had ſuche domage that yf ſuche another
chaunce ſholde fall he ſholde leſe his royalme
for euer / when the kynge had demaunded euery
man and herde all theyr oppynyons. Then
he ſayd to ſyr wyllyam of Lygnacke and to ſyr
Gaultyer of Paſſac / ſyrs let me here your oppynyons
for by you all ſhal be ordeyned ſeynge
ye be the chefe capytaynes of the frenſſhe men
ſente hyder by the frenſſhe kynge and his counſayle.
Theſe .ii. knyghtes regarded eche other
and ſyr Wyllyam ſayd to ſyr Galtyer / ſyr ſpeke
you / and he anſwered and ſayd / nay I wyll not / 
ſpeke you / ye haue vſed armes more then I haue
done. Then ſyr Wyllyam aduyſed hymſelfe
and ſayd / ſyr and it lyke your grace me thynke
ye ought gretely to thanke the noble chyualry
of Fraunce / who are come hyder to ſerue you
ſoo farre of / and ſyr it hathe ſhewed well howe
they haue none affeccyon nor wyll to be cloſed
in ony cyte or towne caſtell / or garyſon / that ye
haue. But they are and haue ben deſyrous to
kepe the feldes / and to fynde out / and to fyght
with your enemyes / the whiche thynge nowe
ſauynge your grace can not be ſuffred for dyuers
reaſons / the pryncypall reaſon is / ſyr we
tary for the duke of Borbon who is onr ſouerayne
capytayne who wyll be here ſhortely and
he ſhall gretely enforce vs with newe freſſhe
men / there be many nowe here with vs that were
neuer in this countrey before / it were neceſſary
that they lerned the maner of this countrey
a two or a thre monethes / for it proueth but ſeldome
well to haſtely to fyght with oure enemyes / 
But lette vs make wyſe warre by garyſons
a two or a thre monethes / and let the Englyſſhemen
and Portyngales ryde abrode in
Galyce where they lyſt / yf they conquere certayne
townes it is but a ſmall matter / as ſoone as
they be departed out of the countrey they wyll
be ſoone wonne agayne. Alſo ſyr there is one
poynte / in armes lyeth many aduentures / ſyr
let them ryde abrode in the countrey whiche is
hoote and of a ſtronge ayre / they maye take ſuche
trauayle and ſykenes that they maye happen
repente them that they haue come ſoo forwarde / 
for they ſhall not fynde the ayre ſoo attemperate
there as it is in Englande or in fraū
               ce / 
nor the wynes ſo pleaſaunt / for in Galyce the
ryuers be troublous and coolde bycauſe of the
ſnowes that dyſcende downe frome the mountaynes
wherby they & theyr horſes after theyr
trauayle all the daye in the hoote ſone ſhall be
morfoundred or they be ware / they be not made

of ſtele nor yet of yron / but at lengthe they ſhall
not endure the hote countrey of Caſtell / they be
men as we be. Thus I thynke we can not better
bete them / but to let them go where they lyſt
they ſhall fynde nothynge in the playne countreys
nor no delectable places to refreſſhe them
for as I vnderſtande all the open countrey is
all redy dyſtroyed with our owne men / and I
alowe well that aduyſe / for yf it were to doo I
wolde counſayle the ſame / ſyrs yf there be ony
here can ſpeke better let hym ſpeke / we ſhall be
glad to here hym / and this ſyr Gaultyer and I
deſyre you all thus to doo / then they all anſwered
with one voyce / lette this aduyſe be admytted / 
we can conſyder no better nor more profytable
way / for the kynge of Caſtel & his royalme.
            SO it was there they concluded that they
ſholde make no countenaunce of warre
tyll the duke of Borbon and all theyr prouyſyons
were come / but that theyr men of warre to
be put in to dyuers garyſons on the fronters of
theyr countrey and ſuffre the englyſſhmen and
Portyngales to go in and out in to the royalme
of Caſtell at theyr pleaſure / ſayenge howe
they coulde not bere awaye the countrey with
them when ſo euer they retourned / thus ended
the counſayle / the kynge of Caſtel had the ſame
daye all them at dyner with hym in his palays
at Burgus in Spayne / ryght plentyfull after
the vſage of Spayne / by the nexte daye at none
al the men of armes departed thyder as they
were appoynted by theyr capytaynes / ſyr Olyuer
Clyſquy and the erle of Longueuyle with
a thouſande ſperes wente to a ſtronge towne
on the fronter of Galyce called Vylleſaunte / 
and ſyr Raynolde and ſyr Tryſtram of Roye
was ſente to another garyſon a .x. legges fro
he fronter of Galyce called Agyllar in the felde
with thre hundred ſperes / Syr Peter of Bellyſme
with two hundred ſperes wente to Pouelles / 
the vycount
                  •
                of Lune wente to the towne
of Marolle / ſyr Iohn̄ of Barres with thre
hundred ſperes was ſente to the caſtell of Noye
within Galyce. Syr Iohn̄ of caſtell Morant
and ſyr Tryſtram of Iayell and dyuers other
were ſente to the cyte of Palance. And the vycount
of Belyer wente to the towne of Rybede
and with hym ſyr Iohn̄ of Braquen / and ſyr
Robert of Braquen▪ ¶Thus theſe men of armes
were deuyded / and ſyr Olyuer of Clyſquy
was made theyr conſtable / and ſyr Wyllyam of
Lygnac and ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac abode ſtyl
with the kynge at Burgus / In this caſe ſtandynge
was the buſynes of Caſtell abydynge
the comynge of the duke of Borbon who was
ſtyll in Fraunce makynge prouyſyon for his
iourney. ¶Nowe we wyll ſuffre in reſt a ſeaſon
the armye of Caſtell and of the duke of Lancaſtre
and alſo of the kynge of Portyngale / and
when the tyme requyreth we ſhal retourne ther
to agayne. And nowe lette vs ſpeke of the aduentures
that fell in the ſame ſeaſon in Fraunce
and in englande the whiche were troublous
and peryllous for bothe royalmes and ſore dyſpleaſaunt
vnto the kynges and to bothe theyr
counſayles.
         
         
            ¶How a grete myſcheffe fell in
Englande bytwene the gentyll
men and comons for
accompte of ſuche money
as hadde ben reyſed
of the comons.
Ca. lxxxi.
            
               HEre before ye haue
herde howe the Frenſſhe
armye with ſhyppes on ye
ſe that were aſſembled at
Sluſe to haue gone in to
Englande was daſſhed &
broken vp / yet to ſhewe
courage and deſyre to goo
another ſeaſon in to englande / and that it ſholde
not be ſayd that the Frenſſhe men were recreaunt
to haue made that voyage. Therfore it
was ordeyned that incontynent at the entre of
May and that the ſee myght be fayre and pleaſaunt.
The conſtable of Fraunce ſholde make a
iourney in to englande with .iiii. M. men of armes
and .ii.M. croſſe bowes / and they ſholde
all aſſemble togyder at a cyte agaynſt the fronter
of Cornewall called Lentrygnyer and there
to be made all theyr prouyſyon and it was ordeyned
euery man to haue a horſe the more eaſely
to 
                  •
               yde abrode in Englande / for it was thought
without horſe they coulde make noo warre
that ſholde auayle them / ſoo there was aſſembled
at this hauen of Lentygnyer a goodly apparell
of ſhyppes / barkes / Bagengers and galeys
wel fournyſſhed with wynes / ſalte fleſſhe
and byſquet and other thynges ſo largely that
it was ſuffycyent for them to lyue by a foure or

fyue monethes without takynge or byenge of
ony thynge in the countrey for ye conſtable and
his company knewe well that as ſoone as the
Englyſſhe men knewe of ſuche a company of
men of warre comynge on them / they wolde dyſtroye
theyr owne goodes abrode in the playne
countrey rather then we ſholde haue ony caſe
therof. Therfore the conſtable made his prouyſyon
redy on that ſyde the ſee. Alſo there was
ordeyned another flete of shyppes at the hauen
of Harflewe for the lorde of Coucy / the lorde of
ſaynt Poule and the admyrall of Fraunce ſholde
there take ſhyppynge with two thouſande
ſperes in lykewyſe to goo in to Englande / and
as the brute wente all this was done to drawe
backe agayne the duke of Lancaſtre and the duches
out of Caſtell. The ſame ſeaſon the duke
of Borbon was at Parys and thought ſurely
that the duke of Lancaſtre ſholde retourne home
agayne in to Englande / wherfore he thoughe
he ſholde haue no thynge to doo to go in to
caſtell nor to trauayle his body ſo farre forthe.
So it was determyned that in the Conſtables
armye ſholde goo / Bretons Augenyms / Poyetenyns
Manceaus and Xayngrons / with knyghtes
and ſquyers of the lowe marches / and
with the lorde of ſaynt Poule and with the lorde
of Coucy ſholde go frenſſhmen / Normans / &
Pycardes / and with the duke of Borbon ſholde
goo two thouſande ſperes of Berrey / Auuernake / 
of Lymoſyn / Borgoyne and of the bace
marches. Thus in that ſeaſon the matters were
concluded in Fraunce and euery man knewe
what he ſholde do / outher to go in to Englande
or in to Caſtell.
            ANd true it was the royalme of Englande
the ſame tyme was in grete peryll &
in a gretter ieoperdye then when the vyllaynes
of Eſſex and Kent rebelled agaynſt the kynge
and the nobles of the royalme at whiche tyme
they came vnto London / I ſhall ſhewe you the
reaſon why / at that ſeaſon all the noble men of
the royalme toke one parte togyder with the
kynge agaynſt the comons / but nowe it is not
ſoo / the nobles vary amonge themſelfe. The
kynge is agaynſt his owne vncles / the duke of
yorke and the duke of Gloceſtre and they were
agaynſt hym and all this varyaunce dyd ryſe
by the meanes of the duke of Irelande who bare
all the chefe rule aboute the kynge / and the
comons of Englande in dyuers cytees knewe
well of this dyſcorde / they that were ſage men
reputed it for a grete euyl and fered that moche
trouble ſholde growe therby / but ſuche as were
lyght perſones made noo rekenynge therof / ſome
ſayenge that it was for enuye that the kynges
vncles hadde agaynſt the kynge theyr nephewe / 
and bycauſe they ſawe howe the crowne
of Englande began to growe farre of frome
them / and ſome other ſayd how the kynge was
but yonge / and byleued yonge counſayle / and
howe that it were better for hym to byleue hys
vncles who mente noo thynge to hym but al honoure
and pro
                  •
               yte nor to the royalme of Englande / 
rather then to be ruled by the prowde
duke of Irelande who neuer ſawe ony thynge
perteynynge to honoure / nor neuer was in ony
batayle. Thus euery man dyffered from other
in the royalme of Englande / Whiche trybulacyons
were well knowen in Fraunce / wherfore
they made this grete prouyſyon to goo thyder
with all theyr puyſſaunce thynkynge to doo a
grete feate / on the other ſyde / the prelates of englande
were in hatred one with another as the
archebyſſhop of Cauntorbury who was of the
Neuelles blood / with the archebyſſhop of yorke.
And yet they were countrey men borne / but
they hated mortally eche other bycauſe the lorde
Neuell hadde the rule and gouernaunce of
Northumbrelande and ſoo to the marches of
Skotlande aboue the erle of Northumbrelande
and his chyldren / the lorde Henry and the
lorde Raffe of Percy / whiche rule the lorde Neuelles
broder had gotten hym / for he was one
of the chefe aboute the kynge with the duke of
Irelande.
         
         
            ¶Of the grete dyſcordes that were
in Englande after the brekynge
vp of the Frenſſhe armye / armye / and
how the gouernours about the
kynge were conſtrayned by the
comons of the good townes to
make accomptes of ſuche money
as was come in to theyr
handes the ſeaſon that they ruled.
Ca. lxxxii.
            
               AS ſone as the englyſſhmen
knewe that the voyage
by the ſee that the frenſſhmen
ſholde haue made beynge at
Sluſe was daſſhed and broken.
Then in Englande began
dyuers murmuracyons

in ſundry places / and ſuche as loued euyll rule
rather then good / ſayd / Where be nowe theſe
grete entrepryſes and theſe valyaunt men of englande
yt were in the dayes of kynge Edwarde
the thyrde / and with the prynce his ſone / we were
wonte to go in to Fraunce and put backe our
enemyes in ſuche maner that none durſt make
batayle with vs / yf they dydde they were ſoone
dyſcomfyted.
            O What a dede was that when the noble
kynge Edwarde aryued in Normandy / 
and in Conſtantyne and paſſed thrugh the royalme
of Fraunce / and what goodly entrepryſe
he acheued in his waye / and after at Creſſy he
dyſcomfyted kynge Phylyp and all the puyſſaunce
of Fraunce / and or he retourned he wan
the towne of Calays / But as nowe the knyghtes
and men of warre in Englande doo none ſuche
feates. ¶Alſo the prynce of Wales ſone to
this noble kynge / dyd he not take the Frenſſhe
kynge. Iohn̄ and dyſcomfyted his pyſſaunce at
Poycters with a ſmal nombre of people agaynſte
the people that kynge Iohn̄ hadde / In thoſe
dayes Englande was fered and doubted / and
were ſpoken of thrughe al the worlde for ye floure
of chyualry / but as nowe no man ſpeketh of
vs / for nowe there is noo warre made / but at
poore mennes purſes / therto euery man is enclyned
/ in Fraunce as nowe the kynge there is
but a chylde and yet he hath done more agaynſt
vs then ony of his predeceſſours. And alſo he
ſhewed grete courage to haue come in to Englande / 
the lette therof was not by hym / but by
his men. The tyme hath ben ſene that yf ſuche
an apparell of ſhyppes had ben made at Sluſe
they ſholde haue ben foughten withall in theyr
owne hauen / and nowe the noble men of Englande
are ioyfull when they maye ſytre at reſt
and ſuffre them in peas / but yet for all that they
ſuffre not poore men to be in reſt / but put them
to buſynes to paye money. The tyme hath ben
that grete conqueſtes haue ben done in fraunce
without payenge of ony money / but ſuche ryches
as hath ben gotten there it hath ben ſpred
abrode in the royalme. where is become ye grete
fynaunces and tayles that hath ben gadered in
this royalme with the kynges rentes and accoſtomed
reuenues / outher they haue loſt it or taken
fro them / it is behouable that it be knowen
howe the royalme of Englande is gouerned / 
and howe the kynge is ledde / it were not good
that it ſholde be longe or it were knowen / for
this royalme of Englande is not ſoo ryche nor
ſo puyſſaunt to bere lyke charges as the royalme
of Fraunce dothe. ¶Alſo it appereth wel
that we in this royalme of englande are febled
of wyttes and of grace. We were wonte to knowe
euery thynge that was done in Fraunce a
thre or foure monethes or the caſe fell / wherby
we myght conuenyently make prouyſyon and
reſyſtence / but as nowe we knowe noo thynge / 
But the Frenſſhe men knoweth all our ſecretes
and counſayles / we cannot tell in whome
is the fawte / it wyll be knowen vpon a daye.
There be ſome preuy traytours / and it were
better it were knowen betymes then to late / for
it maye be knowen ſoo la
                  •
               e that it wyll be paſt
remedy.
            THus dyuerſely men talked in Englande
as well knyghtes and ſquyers
as the comons ſoo that the royalme
laye in a harde caſe and grete
peryll. And the grete aſſembly that the kyng
and his vncles and his counſayle hadde made
with grete expence in dyuers maners to reſyſt
the frenſſhe kynge beynge a Sluſe redy to entre
in to Englande / ſuche knyghtes and ſquyers / 
and other as were in a redynes wolde as
then be payde of theyr wages / and ſo for that entente
there was a parlyamente ſomoned to be
holden at London by the nobles / prelates / and
comons of Englonde / and pryncypally it was
ordeyned that there ſholde be reyſed a grete tayle
and ſubſydye thrughe out the royalme of Englande / 
the ryche to bere out the poore. This
parlyament was remoued to weſtmynſtre / and
thyder came all ſuche as were ſente for / and many
moo to here tydynges. ¶There was the
kynge and his two vncles Edmunde and Thomas
with many other nobles of the royalme.
And amonge other thynges yt was ſayd that
in the kynges treaſoure there was ſubſtaunce
ſkante to maynteyne the kynges eſtate ſoberly.
Wherfore they of his counſayle ſayd howe
there muſt be leuyed a ſubſydye thrughe out all
the royalme of Englande yf ſuche coſtes and
charges ſholde be payde as hathe ben done / for
the defence of the royalme of englande agaynſt
the frenſſhe men. To this agreed well they of
the byſſhopryche of Norwyche / and alſo the
archebyſſhopryche of Cauntorbury / and the
countye of Eſſex / the countye of Hampton and
Warwykeſhyre / and the lande of ye erle of Salyſbury / 
they agreed ſoner then they of ferther

countreys as they of the north and marches of
Wales / and of Cornewall / al theſe rebelled and
ſayd / We haue not ſene none of our enemyes
come in to this countrey / why ſholde we be greued
and haue done no fawte / yes yes ſayd ſome
let the byſſhop of yorke be ſpoken withall and
the kynges counſayle / and the duke of Irelande
who hathe .lx. thouſande frankes of the conſtable
of fraunce for the redempcyon of Iohan
of Bretayne / this money ought to be tourned
to the comon profyte of all Englande. ye and
ſpeke with ſyr Symon Burle / Syr Wyllyam
Helmen / Syr Thomas Branbe / Syr Robert
Tryuylyen / and ſyr Iohan Beauchampe
who haue gouerned the kynge and the royalme / 
yf they make a good accompte of that they
haue receyued and delyuer it / the comons ſhall
ſytte in reſt / and euery thynge payde as it ought
to be. ¶When theſe wordes came abrode
and to the herynge of the kynges vncles / they
were ryght gladde therof / for that made well
for them / for al thoſe before named were agaynſte
them. Nor they coulde bere noo rule in the
courte for them. Wherfore they ayded the people
in theyr oppynyons and ſayd. Theſe good
men that thus ſpeketh are well counſayled / in
that they deſyre to haue accompte / and wyll not
paye ony more money. For ſurely outher in the
kynges treaſure / or elles in theyr purſes that
gouerne hym there muſt nedes be grete treaſure.
Thus by lytell and lytell multyplyed theſe
wordes / and the people beganne to waxe bolde
to deny to paye ony more money by reaſon that
they ſawe the kynges vncles of theyr accorde / 
and ſuſteyned them. ¶And the archebyſſhop
of Cauntorbury / the erle of Salyſbury / the erle
of Northumbrelande / and dyuers other lordes
of Englande put of this taxe for that tyme
and deferred theyr counſayle to Myghelmaſſe
after / at whiche tyme they promyſed to retourne
agayne / but the knyghtes and ſquyers ſuche
as had thought to haue had money for the arrerages
of theyr wages hadde noo thynge / Wherfore / 
they were in dyſpleaſure with the kynge
and his counſayle. They were apeaſed as well
as myght be / & euery man departed / the kynge
toke no leue of his vncles / nor they of hym.
            THen the kynge was counſayled to drawe
in to the marches of Wales and there
to tary tyll he herde other tydynges / and ſoo
he was contente to doo / and departed fro London
without leue takynge of ony man / and toke
with hym all his counſayle excepte the archebyſſhop
of yorke who wente backe in to his

thynke yf he hadde ben with the other / he ſholde
haue ben ſerued as they were / as ye ſhall here
after. But it is requyſyte that I ſpeke as well
of Fraunce as of Englande / for the matter requyreth it.
         
         
            ¶Howe the conſtable of Fraunce
and dyuers other lordes and
ſquyers of the royalme apparelled
grete prouyſyons to go in to
Englande to wynne townes
and caſtelles. Ca. lxxxiii.
            
               ANd when ſeaſon of ſomer
was come and the ioly
moneth of Maye in the yere
of our lorde god. M.CCC.
foure ſcore and .vii. In the
ſame ſeaſon that the duke of
Lancaſtre was in Galyce / 
and conquered there / and that ye kynge of Portyngale
with grete puyſſaunce rode abrode in
Caſtell without ony withſtandynge. Thenne
was it ordeyned in Fraunce as ye haue herde
before howe the conſtable of Fraunce with one
army / and the erle of ſaynt Poule / the lorde of
Coucy and ſyr Iohan of Vyen with another
armye / the one at Lentrygnyer in Bretayne / 
and the other at Harflewe in Normandy ſholde
the ſame ſeaſon make a voyage in to englande
with a .vi. thouſande men of armes and two
thouſande croſſe bowes / and .vi. thouſande
other men of warre / and it was ordeyned that
none ſholde paſſe the ſee to goo in to Englande
without he were well armed / and prouyſyon
of vytayles for the ſpace of thre monethes with
other prouyſyon of hay & ootes for theyr horſes
& a daye was prefyxed amonge the capytaynes
when they ſholde departe / and were determyned
to lande in englande in two hauens at Douer / 
and at Orwell / thus the daye approched of
theyr departure. At Lentrygnyer prouyſyon
was made and put in to the ſhyppes for them
that ſholde paſſe from thens / and in lyke wyſe
was done at Harflewe / and euery man of war
was payde theyr wages for .xv. dayes. This
iourney was ſoo farre forwarde / that it was

thought it coulde not haue ben broken. ¶Nor
alſo it brake not by noo cauſe of the capytaynes
that were ordeyned to goo in that voyage. But
it brake by another incydent and by a meruayllous
matter that fell in Bretayne wherwith the
Frenſſhe kynge and his counſayle were ſoore
dyſpleaſed / but they coulde not amende it / wherfore
it behoued them wyſely to dyſſymule ye matter
for it was no tyme then to remedy it. ¶Alſo
other tydynges came vnto the Frenſſhe kynge
out of the partyes of Almayne as I ſhall ſhewe
you hereafter when tyme and place ſhall requyre
it. But fyrſt we wyll ſpeke of the matters of
Bretayne before them of Almayne / for they of
Bretayne fell fyrſte / and were worſte reputed / 
thoughe other coſt more.
            
               YF I ſholde ſaye that ſuche matters
fell in that ſeaſon and not open clerely
the mater whiche was grete / 
peryllous and horryble / it myght
be a cronycle / but n
                  •
               o hyſtory / I
myght let it ouerpaſſe yf I lyſt / but I wyll not
doo ſoo / I ſhall declare the caſe ſyth god hathe
gyuen me the knowledge therof / and tyme and
leyſure to cronycle the matter at lengthe. ¶ye
haue herde here before in dyuers places in this
hyſtory howe ſyr Iohn̄ of Mountforde named
duke of Bretayne / and ſurely ſo he was by conqueſt
and not by ryght lyne / howbeit alwayes
he maynteyned the warre and oppynyon of the
kynge of Englande and of his chydren agaynſt
the frenſſhe kynge. Alſo he had good cauſe ſoo
to doo on his partye / for without the ayde of englande
he hadde not atteyned as he dyd nother
before Alroy nor in other places. Alſo ye haue
herde here before howe the duke of Bretayne
coulde not haue his entente of all the nobles of
his countrey / nor of all the good townes ſpecyally
of ſyr Bertram of Cleſquy as longe as he
lyued / nor of ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon conſtable of
Fraunce / nor of the lordes de la Vale / and of
Beawmanoyre / nor the lorde of Raſe / of Dygnant / 
the vycount of Rohan / nor of the lorde of
Rochforde / for whereas theſe lordes enclyned
nyghe all Bretayne folowed. They were contente
to take parte with theyr lorde the duke
agaynſt all maner of men excepte agaynſt the
crowne of Fraunce. And ſurely I can not ſe
nor ymagyne by what waye / but that the Bretons
pryncypally regarded euer the honoure
of Fraunce / it maye well appere by that that is
wrytten here before in this hyſtory. I ſaye not
this by noo corrupcyon nor fauoure that I haue
to the erle Guy of Bloys who hath ben good
lorde vnto me / and I haue hadde moche profyte
by hym who was nephewe and nexte to the
erle Loys of Bloys broder germayne to ſaynt
Charles of Bloys / and as longe as he lyued he
was duke of Bretayne. Truely I ſaye not this
for no cauſe but all onely to declare the trouthe
And alſo the gentyll prynce and erle that hathe
cauſed me to wryte this ſtory wolde in no wyſe
that I ſholde ſwarue from the trouth.
            NOwe to retourne to our purpoſe
ye knowe well as longe as duke
Iohan of Bretayne lyued he coulde
neuer attayne to haue all his
men in euery poynte to agree to his oppynyons.
And he ſore fered them leſt at the laſt they
ſholde haue taken hym and put hym in pryſon
in Fraunce. Wherfore he departed out of Bretayne
and wente in to Englande with all his
houſeholde / and ye lady his wyfe Iahan of Holande
doughter ſomtyme of the good knyght
ſyr Thomas Holande / and thus a ſeaſon he became
ſeruaunt to kynge Rycharde of Englande / 
and afterwarde he wente in to Flaunders
to ye erle of Bloys who was his coſyn germayne
& there taryed more then a yere and an halfe.
¶Fynally they of his owne countrey ſente for
hym / and ſoo by good accorde thyder he wente.
¶And when he came in to his countrey there
were certayne townes cloſed ſtyl agaynſt hym
and rebelled / and ſpecyally the cyte of Nauntes.
But all his lordes / knyghtes and prelates
were all of his accorde excepte the lordes before
reherſed / and to haue the ſygnory of them / and
to gete the fauoure and good wyll of the good
townes and Cytyes / and to put the Frenſſhe
kynge in more fere bycauſe he wolde ouerpreſſe
them with taxes and ſubſydyes as they dyd in
Fraunce and in Pycardye whiche they wolde
not ſuffre in Bretayne. Therfore he ſente vnto
the kynge of Englande for ſocoure and ayde
of men of warre and archers / promyſynge that
yf the kynge of Englande wolde come in too
Bretayne / or elles one of his vncles with a grete
puyſſaunce of men of armes and of archers
howe that his countrey of Bretayne ſholde be
opened redy to receyue hym and his company.
¶The kynge of Englande and his counſayle
were gladde of thoſe tydynges & thought them
good and concluded to ſende thyder / thē prouyſyon
was made / and thyder was ſente the erle

of Buckyngham with .iii. M. men of armes
and .viii. M. archers who aryued at Calays / 
and paſſed throughe the royalme of Fraunce
without ony reſyſtence as it hathe ben ſhewed
here before demaundynge noo thynge but batayle / 
and ſo they came in to Bretayne truſtynge
to haue founde the countrey redy open for
them to receyue and to refreſſhe them / for 
                  ••
               rely
they had made a longe voyage. Howbeit they
founde it contrary dyſpoſed / for the duke of Bretayne
was ſoo ledde by his men and ſo wyſely
entreated that they made a peas bytwene hym
and the yonge Charles kynge as then in fraunce / 
but with kynge Charles his fader he coulde
neuer haue peas he hated hym ſoo ſore. The
duke of Borgoyne who was one of the cheſe gouernours
in the royalme of Fraunce ayded gretely
to make this peas / he was ſo deſyred by the
lady his wyfe bycauſe the duke of Bretayne
was nere of theyr lygnage ſoo he was fayne to
breke all his promyſes with the Englyſſhmen
for he coulde not be ſuffred to accomplyſſhe his
couenaunt / for the Bretons wolde not conſent
to yelde them to the kynge of Englande to make
warre agaynſt Fraunce / they ſayd they were
neuer of that oppynyon nor neuer wolde be / ſo
that it behoued the Englyſſhmen to take theyr
lodgynges in ye marches of wannes where they
ſuffered as moche pouerte as euer dyd men for
one tyme / and ſpecyally theyr horſes dyed for
hungre and pouerte / and ſoo in the tyme of ſomer
they departed out of Bretayne as euyl contente
with the duke of Bretayne as myght be / 
and not without a cauſe. And ſpecyally the erle
of Buckyngham and the barons of Englande
that were in his company / and when they were
retourned in to Englande they made grete
complayntes to the kynge and to the duke of
Lancaſtre and his counſayle. And then it was
deuyſed and ordeyned that Iohn̄ of Bretayne
ſholde be delyuered / and to brynge hym with
puyſſaunce in to Bretayne to make warre there
agaynſt the duke of Bretayne / and the Englyſſhe
men ſayd howe ſyr Iohn̄ of Mountforde
knewe well howe they had put hym in poſſeſſyon
of the ſygnory of Bretayne for without
vs he hadde neuer come therto. And nowe to
play vs this tourne to cauſe vs to trauayle our
bodyes and to ſpende the kynges treaſoure / it
behoueth vs to ſhewe hym his fawtes. And we
can not better be reuenged then to delyuer his
aduerſary and to brynge hym in to Bretayne / 
For all the countrey wyll delyuer hym townes
Cytees / and fortreſſes / and put the other duke
clene that thus hathe mocked and dyſceyued
vs. ¶Thus the Englyſſhe counſayle were all
of one accorde / and then Iohn̄ of bretayne was
brought in to the kynges preſence / and there it
was ſhewed hym howe they wolde make hym
duke of Bretayne and recouer for hym all his
herytage of Bretayne. And he ſholde haue to
his wyfe the lady Phylyp of Lancaſtre / ſo that
he wolde holde the duchy of Bretayne in fayth
and homage of the kynge of Englande / the whiche
poynte he vtterly refuſed. But to take the
dukes doughter in maryage he was contente / 
But to ſwere to be agaynſt the crowne of fraunce
in noo wyſe he wolde conſente / but rather to
abyde in pryſon all his lyfe.
            WHen the kynge and his counſayle ſawe
that / they withdrewe the grace that
they hadde thought to haue ſhewed to
hym / and thenne he was delyuered in to the kepynge
of ſyr Iohan Dambretycourte as ye haue
herde before / I haue made as nowe relacyon
of all theſe matters bycauſe of the incydentes
that folowed after and appered by the duke
of Bretayne / for the duke knewe well howe he
was gretely out of the fauoure of the noble men
of the royalme of Englande / and alſo of the comons
there. And he ymagened that the hatred
that they bare to hym was for the voyage that
the erle of Buckyngham hadde made thrughe
Fraunce to come in to Bretayne / wenynge to
haue founde the duke there and countrey open
agaynſt them / as the duke of Bretayne hadde
promyſed / whiche the Englyſſhe men founde
contrary. ¶Alſo he ſawe well howe the kynge
of Englande hadde not wryten vnto hym ſoo
amyably as he hadde done often tymes before.
And ſpecyally as he hadde done before the erle
of Buckynghams voyage. ¶And alſo he doubted
that the kynge of Englande ſholde delyuer
Iohan of Bretayne to the entente to make
hym warre. ¶Thenne the duke caſt his ymagynacyon
how he myght fynde remedy in this
matter / and to brynge it in to a good poynte / 
And to doo his entente ſoo ſecretly that the Englyſſhe
men ſholde be well content and pleaſed
with hym. For he knewe well the man in the
worlde whome the Englyſſhmen hated mooſt
was ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon conſtable of fraunce.
For in dede ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon euer ſtudyed
nyght and daye howe he myght doo dyſpleaſure
to the Englyſſhe men / and the duke
knewe ryght well of the armye that was made

to god in to Englande bocke at Harflew: and
at Lentrygnyer / then he ſayd vnto hymſelfe to
the entente to pleaſe the Englyſſhe men and to
ſhewe that he dyd not ſet moche by the Frenſſhe
men / he founde the meanes to breke that voyage
not in commaundynge his men of Bretayne
on payne of leſynge of theyr herytage not to go
in to Englande / nor to ayde the frenſſhe partye
this he dyd not / but he ſhewed outwardly that
the warre was for hym / but he dyd his entrepryſe
more couertly / he caſte in his ymagynacyon
that he myght not doo more honourably / 
nor more to his profyte / then to take the conſtable
of Fraunce pryſoner or elles to ſlee hym / 
therby he knewe well he ſholde pleaſe the Englyſſhe
men / for they hated hym / for he thought
yf he were out of the waye he cared not for the
reſydue of his lygnage / for he knewe well they
were not able to make hym warre / for the conſtable
hadde but two doughters / the one was
maryed vnto Iohn̄ of Bretayne / and the other
doughter was maryded vnto the erle of Rohans
ſone / he thought to withſtande them wel
ynoughe and all his lygnage / for yf he hadde
ſlayne hym he ſayd he hadde ſlayne but a baron
and that there were none that wolde make hym
ony warre for his ſake.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Bretayne ſente
for all his lordes and knyghtes to
come to counſayle vnto wannes
and after counſayle he deſyred
the conſtable to goo and ſe
his caſtell of Ermyne / and
howe he toke hym there
pryſoner / and the lorde
of Beaumanoyre with
hym. Ca. lxxxiii.
            
               ON this foreſayd ymagynacyon
the duke of Bretayne
reſted / and to come to
his entente he ſomoned his
counſayle to come to Wannes / 
and deſyred all the lordes
and knyghtes of Bretayne
effectuouſly for to come thyder / and he dyd
ſende out his letters vnto them / and ſpecyally
he requyred ſyr Olyuere of Clyſſon Conſtable
of Fraunce that he ſholde not fayle but for to
be there / ſayenge howe he wolde gladlyer ſe
hym then ony other. The conſtable wolde not
exſcuſe hymſelfe bycauſe the duke of Bretayne
was his naturall lorde / and was gladde to haue
his good wyll / and ſoo he came to Wannes / 
and ſoo dydde a grete nombre of other lordes
of Bretayne. ¶This counſayle was longe
and many matters debated therin touchynge
the duke and his countrey without ony worde
ſpekynge of the voyage that they were in purpoſe
to make in to Englande. The duke dyſſymuled
the matter. This counſayle was in the
cyte of wannes in a caſtell called the Mote.
            ¶The duke made all the lordes a grete dyner / 
and fedde them with fayre louynge wordes tyll
it was nere nyght / and then they retourned to
theyr lodgynges in to the ſubbarbes withoute
the cyte. And the conſtable of Fraunce to pleaſe
the knyghtes and ſquyers of Bretayne he deſyred
them all the nexte daye to dyne with hym
ſome dyd ſoo and ſome departed to theyr owne
howſes to take leue of theyr wyues & parentes / 
for the conſtable was purpoſed as ſoone as h
                  •
               
departed thens ſtrayght to goo vnto his nau
                  •
               e
at Lentrygnyer / the duke of Bretayne knewe
it ryght well / but ſpake noo worde therof makynge
ſemblaunte as thoughe he knewe noo
thynge. Soo this dyner ended where as were
the mooſt parte of the barons of Bretayne / and
ſodaynly vnto them came the duke of Bretayne
ryght amorouſly by ſemynge / but he thought
otherwyſe in his harte. None knewe therof
but ſuche as he hadde dyſcouered his mynde
vnto. As ſoone as he entred in to the conſtables
lodgynge / ſome ſayd / beholde here cometh the
duke / then euery man roſe as reaſon was and
ſwetely receyued hym as they ought for to doo
theyr lorde / and he delte ryght getylly and he
ſate downe amonge them and ete and dranke / 
and kepte good company and ſhewed them more
tokens of loue then euer he dydde before / and
he ſayd vnto them / fayre lordes my louers and
frendes / god ſende you well to goo and well to
come agayne / and ſende you ioye / and that you
maye doo ſuche dedes of armes as maye / pleaſe
you / and that it maye be honourable vnto you
all / and when they herde theſe ſwere wordes of
the duke / they all anſwered and ſayd. Syr we
thanke you / and god rewarde you of your grete
kyndneſſe that it pleaſeth you to come and ſe
vs at our departynge.
            
               
THis ſame ſeaſon the duke of Bretayne
was makynge of a Caſtell nere to Wannes
called the caſtell of Ermyne the whiche as
then was nere furnyſſhed and to the entente to
attrappe the conſtable / there he ſayd vnto hym
and vnto the lorde de la vale and to the lorde of
Beawmanoyre and to other lordes that were
there. Syrs I requyre you or ye departe to come
and ſe my newe caſtell of Armyne / ye ſhall
ſe howe I haue deuyſed it / and alſo howe I
purpoſe for to doo. ¶They all agreed vnto
hym / bycauſe they ſawe hym come ſoo louyngly
amonge them / for they thought none euyll.
And ſoo the mooſt parte of them mounted on
theyr horſes and rode forth with the duke to the
caſtel of Armyne. Than the duke / the conſtable
the lorde de la vale / and the lorde of Beawmanoyre
and dyuers other lordes and knyghtes
alyghted of theyr horſes and entred in to the caſtell
/ and the duke ledde the conſtable by ye hande
fro chambre to chambre and in to euery houſe
of offyce and made them drynke in the ſeller.
Then the duke brought them to the chefe towre
and at the dore therof he ſayd to the conſtable.
Syr Olyuere I knowe noo man on this
ſyde the ſee that knoweth more in buyldynge
then ye doo / wherfore I praye you mounte vp
the ſtayres and beholde the buyldynge of the
towre / yf it be well I am contente / and yf ony
thynge be amyſſe / yt ſhall be refourmed after
your deuyſe / ye conſtable thynkynge none euyll
ſayd. Syr with ryght a good wyl pleaſe it you
to goo before and I ſhall folowe you / naye ſyr
ſayd the duke goo your waye vp alone and in
the meane tyme I wyll talke with the lorde de
la vale / the conſtable wente vp the ſtayres and
when he was aboue and paſte the fyrſte ſtage / 
there were mē in a chābre layde in a buſſhment
and they opened the dore / and ſome wents downe
and dyd ſhote the dore bynethe and the other
wente vp all armed to the conſtable / there they
toke and ledde hym in to a chambre and fetered
hym with .iii. boltes of yron / and ſayd to hym / 
Syr pardon vs for we muſt nedes do that we
do / we be thus commaunded by our lorde the
duke of Bretayne / yf ye conſtable were abaſſhed
at that tyme it was no meruayle.
            
               THe cōſtable ought not to haue grete
meruayle of ye chaunce for after
that the dyſpleaſure fell bytwene
the duke and hym / for ony letters
that the duke coulde wryte to hym
or for ony deſyre or ſaufconduyte to come and
goo ſaufely / yet for all that the conſtable wolde
neuer come in the dukes preſence / for he durſte
not truſt hym / and nowe he is come to his myſfortune / 
for he founde the duke in grete dyſpleaſure
with hym / and that was well ſhewed / and
when the lorde de la vale beynge bynethe at the
ſtayre foote ſawe the dore cloſed / his blood began
to trymble and had grete fere of his broder
and behelde the duke who waxed pale and grene
as a lefe / then he knewe that the matter wente
amyſſe and ſayd. A ſyr for goddes ſake haue
mercy / what wyll you do / take none euyll wyll
agaynſt the conſtable / ſyr ſayd the duke / take ye
your horſe and departe / ye maye goo when ye
wyll / I knowe well ynoughe what I haue to
do. Syr ſayd the lorde de la vale I wyll not de
parte hens without I haue my broder the conſtable
with me / with thoſe wordes there came
vnto them the lorde of Beawmanoyre whome
the duke alſo hated / and he in lyke wyſe demaū
               ded
to haue the conſtable. Then the duke drewe
his dagger and came vnto hym and ſayd.
Beawmanoyre wylte thou be in the ſame poynte
as thy mayſter is in. Syr ſayd he I truſt my
mayſter is in good caſe / well ſayd the duke / I
demaunde of the yf thou wylte be in lyke caſe.
ye ſyr ſayd he. Thenne the duke toke his dagger
by the poynte and ſayd / yf thou wylte be in
lyke caſe it behoueth the to put out one of thyne
eyen. The lorde of Beawmanoyre ſawe well
the matter wente not well and ſawe the duke
waxe pale for angre. Then he kneled downe on
his knee and ſayd. Syr I repute ſoo grete noblenes
in you that I truſt in god and you that
ye wyll doo vs ryght / we be at your mercy / and
we are come hyder at your requeſt / we truſt ye
wyll not dyſhonour yourſelf
                  •
               e to accomplyſſhe
ony euyll wyll that ye haue to vs / it ſholde be a
ſtraunge nouelte. Well ſayd the duke come on
thy waye / for thou ſhalte haue noo more nor no
leſſe then he ſhall haue. Soo he was ledde in
to another chambre and fetered alſo with thre
payre of yrons / If he were abaſſhed he hadde a
grete cauſe / for he perceyued well the duke loued
hym but lytell / nor the conſtable alſo / but
then he had no remedy.
            
               AN one tydynges ſpredde ouer the
caſtell and alſo the towne howe
that the conſtable of Fraunce and
the lorde of Beawmanoyre and
alſo the lorde de la Vale were taken
pryſoners. And howe the lorde de la Vale

myght departe when he wolde / For the duke
demaunded no thynge of hym / wherof the people
hadde grete meruayle and alſo grete cauſe
why / for euery man ſayd howe the duke wolde
put them bothe to dethe / he hated them ſo mortally.
The duke was gretely blamed of all knyghtes
and ſquyers that herde therof / and they
ſayd there was neuer a gretter dyffamacyon on
ony prynce then was on the duke of Bretayne
ſeynge that he had deſyred the conſtable to dyne
with hym and to ſe his houſe / and to make
hym good chere and ſoo to take hym pryſoner / 
they ſayd they neuer herde of caſe lyke / wherfore
he was infamed and neuer man more dyſhonoured / 
nor therby noo man ſholde truſt in ony
prynce ſyth the duke had dyſceyued theſe noble
men / what wyll the frenſſhe kynge ſay when he
knoweth this / for by this his voyage in to Englande
is broken / there was neuer ſoo grete a
ſhame ymagyned / but nowe the duke ſheweth
what laye in his harte / we tro we there was neuer
ſene in Bretayne caſe lyke nor in none other
place / yf a poore knyght had done ſuche a dede
he were dyſhonoured for euer / in whom ſholde
a man truſt but in his lorde / and ye lorde ſholde
maynteyne hym in his ryght and doo hym Iuſtyce / 
who ſhall make correccyon of this dede / 
none but the frenſſhe kynge / nowe ye duke ſheweth
playnly howe he is on the englyſſhe parte &
wyll ſuſteyne and holde with the oppynyon of
the kynge of Englande / ſyth he hath thus broken
the voyage by the ſee that ſholde haue gone
in to Englande / What ſhall become nowe
of the knyghtes and ſquyers of Bretayne when
they ſhall here theſe tydynges nothynge but in
contynent come fro theyr houſes & lay ſyege to
the caſtell of Armyne and cloſe the duke within
& there tary tyll they haue taken hym outher
deed or quycke and lede hym lyke a falſe prynce
to the frenſſhe kynge. Thus the knyghtes and
ſquyers aboute the marches of Wannes ſpake
and comoned togyder / and ſuche as were come
thyder to that counſayle with the ſayd lordes / &
they were in grete doubte that the duke wolde
put them to dethe / then ſome other ſayd / as for
the lorde de la Vale is in no ieopardy / he is ſoo
wyſe that he wyll tempre the duke in all his buſynes / 
and truely ſo he dyd / for and he had not
ben the conſtable had ben deed the fyrſt nyght if
he had had a. M. lyues.
            IT ought to be byleued that ſyr Olyuer of
Clyſſon was not at his caſe when he ſaw
hymſelfe ſoo taken and attrapped / and fetered
and kepte with .xxx. perſones / and hadde noo
comforte by them / for they knewe not the wyll
of theyr lorde / ſoo that he rekened hymſelfe but
as a deed man / and alſo he hadde noo hope to
lyue tyll the nexte daye / and ſurely he was in
grete daungere / for .iii. tymes he was vnfetered
and brought to haue ben beheded or elles
drowned / and ſurely ſo he had ben yf the lorde
de la vale had not ben / but when this lorde de la
vale herde the dukes ſtrayte cōmaundement to
put hym to dethe / he kneled downe before hym
lyftynge vp his handes ſore wepynge and ſayd
ſyr for goddes ſake take mercy / aduyſe you ſhewe
not your cruelte agaynſt the conſtable / he
hath deſerued no dethe / ſyr of your grace that
it may pleaſe you to ſhewe me the cauſe of your
dyſpleaſure agaynſt hym / and ſyr I ſwere vnto
you ony treſpace that he hath done he ſhall make
you ſuche amendes with his body and goodes / 
or elles I for hym as ye yourſelfe ſhall demaunde
or Iudge / ſyr remembre you howe in
your yongth ye .ii. were companyons togyder
and brought vp bothe in one houſe with the duke
of Lancaſtre who was ſoo gentyll a prynce
that there was none lyke hym. Alſo ſyr remembre
howe before his peas was made with the
frenſſhe kynge alwayes he truely ſerued you / 
he ayded you to recouer your herytage / ye haue
alwayes founde in hym good comforte and coū
               ſayle / 
yf ye be now moued or enfourmed agaynſte
hym otherwyſe then reaſon ſholde requyre / 
yet he hathe not deſerued dethe / ſyr de la vale
ſayd the duke let me haue my wyll / for Olyuer
of Clyſſon hath ſoo often tymes dyſpleaſed me / 
and nowe is the houre come that I maye ſhewe
hym my dyſpleaſure. Wherfore departe you
hens and let me ſhewe my cruelte / for I wyll he
ſhall dye. A ſyr ſayd the lorde de la vale / refrayne
your euyll wyll and moderate your courage
and regarde to reaſon / for yf ye puth ym to deth
there was neuer prynce ſoo dyſhonoured as ye
ſhall be / there ſhall not be in Bretayne knyght
nor ſquyer cyte nor caſtell nor good towne / nor
noo man but he ſhall hate you to the dethe / and
doo that they can to dyſenheryte you / Nor the
kynge of Englande nor his counſayle ſhall gyue
you no thanke therfore / ſyr wyl you leſe your
ſelfe for the dethe of one man / ſyr tourne your
ymagynacyon / for this thought is noo thynge
worth but dyſhonourable / that ye ſholde cauſe
ſuche an honourable knyght as ſyr Olyuere of
Clyſſon is to dye comynge vnto you at your
owne deſyre. ¶Surely ſyr this dede ſholde be

treaſon and grete reproche bothe before god &
the worlde / to deſyre hym thus to dyner and he
comynge to you / and after that ye went to hym
in to the towne deſyrynge hym to ſe your newe
buyldynges / and he obeyed in euery thynge to
you & dranke of your wyne / and is this ye grete
loue that ye ſhewed hym / to put hym to dethe / 
there was neuer ſoo grete blame layde to ony
lorde as ſhall be layde to you / all ye worlde ſhal
reproche you and hate you mortally & be glad
to make you warre. But ſyr I ſhall ſhewe you
what ye ſhall do ſyth ye ſoo ſore hate hym / put
hym to raunſome to a grete ſome of Floreynes
this ye may well do / and if he holde outher towne
or caſtell that ſholde be yours demaunde thē
agayne and ye ſhall haue them / and loke what
couenaunt ye make with hym I ſhall become
pledge therfore / and when the duke herde the
lorde de la vale ſpeke ſo reaſonably and preſſed
ſo ſore on hym / as in a maner all that nyght he
wolde not departe from hym / then the duke ſtudyed
a lytell and ſomwhat refrayned his euyll
wyll / and at laſt ſpake and ſayd / ſyr de la vale
ye be a good meane for hym / howbeit I wyl ye
knowe ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon is the man in the
worlde that I moost hate / for and ye were not
he ſholde not ſkape without dethe this ſame nyght / 
your wordes hath ſaued hym / go to hym &
demaunde yf he wyll paye to me a. C. M. frankes
incontynente / for I wyll nother haue hym
nor you to pledge nor nothynge elles but the redy
money / and beſyde that to yelde to me .iii. caſtelles
and a towne ſuche as I ſhall name / the
caſtell of Breth / the caſtel of Ioſſelyn / the caſtel
of blancke and the towne of Iugon and put me
in poſſeſſyon of them or my deputyes / this done
I ſhall delyuer hym to you / this ſhal be done
ſayd the lorde de la vale / and ſyr I thanke you
that ye wyl thus do at my deſyre / and ſyr be you
ſure all that ye haue demaunded ſhall be done / 
theſe caſtelles & towne delyuered & theſe. C. M
frankes payde or he departe.
            THen the lorde de la vale was gretely reioyced
when he ſawe the conſtable out
of peryll of deth. Then the towre dore was opened
and ye lorde de la vale mounted vp & came
there as ye conſtable was ſyttyng ſore abaſſhed
for he loked for nothynge but for dethe / & when
he ſawe the lorde de la vale his herte reuyued &
thought there was ſome tretye in hande. Then
the lorde de la vale ſayd to them that were there
by ſyrs take of his yrons yt I maye ſpeke with
hym fro the duke and ſayd to hym / ſyr howe ſay
you wyll you do that I ſhall ſhewe you / ye truely
ſyr ſayd the conſtable / then his yrons were
taken of / and the lorde de la vale drewe hym a
parte and ſayd. Fayre broder with grete payne
and moche buſynes I haue ſaued your lyfe and
made your ende / but ye muſt pay or ye departe
hens in redy money a. C. M. frankes and more
ouer to yelde vp to the duke .iii. caſtelles and ye
towne of Iugon / otherwyſe ye can haue no delyueraunce / 
then the conſtable ſayd I wyll not
refuſe ye bargayne / but who ſhall go to Clyſſon
to fetche this money / fayre broder ſayd the conſtable
I thynke ye muſt be fayne to go therfore
Naye ſyr not ſo ſayd the lorde de la vale / for I
haue promyſed neuer to departe out of this caſtell
tyll I haue you with me / for I knowe wel
the duke is ryght cruell / and peraduenture in
myne abſence wyll repente hym by ſome lyght
informacyon and ſo then al were loſt / why who
ſhall go then ſayd the conſtable / ſyr ſayd he the
lorde of Beawmanoyre ſhall goo / he is here in
pryſon as wel as ye be / he ſhal make al this prouyſyon / 
that is well ſayd ſayd the conſtable / go
your waye downe / and ordeyne euery thynge
as ye lyſt.
         
         
            ¶Howe the conſtable of Fraunce
was delyuered at the requeſt of
the lorde de la vale payenge certayne
raunſome / and howe the conſtable
delyuered to the duke .iii. caſtelles
and a towne and payde. C. M.
frankes. Ca. lxxxv.
            
               THus the lorde de la vale
wente downe of the towre
to ye duke who was goynge
to bed / for of all that nyght
he had not ſlepte / then the lorde
de la vale kneled downe
and ſayd / ſyr ye ſhall haue al
your demaunde / but ſyr ye muſt delyuer the lorde
of Beawmanoyre that he maye ſpeke with ye
conſtable / for he muſt go and fetche this raunſome
and put your men in poſſeſſyon of the caſtelles
that ye deſyre to haue / wel ſayd the duke
delyuer them out of pryſon and put them into a
chambre / & be you the meane of theyr tretye / for
I wyll not ſe them / and retourne agayne to me
when I haue ſlepte and I wyll ſpeke with you
Then ye lorde de la vale yſſued out of the chambre
and went with two knyghtes thyder where

as the lorde of Beawmanoyre was in pryſon / 
who was gretely abaſſhed and doubted ſore
the dethe / he fered when he herde the dore open
that they were come to haue put hym to dethe / 
But when he ſawe the lorde de la vale entre his
harte reuyued / and more when he herde hym
ſpeke ſayenge / ſyr of Beawmanoyre your delyueraunce
is made / wherfore ye maye be gladde
then his fetters were taken of / and ſo he wente
in to another chambre / and then the conſtable
was alſo brought thyder / and mete and wyne
was brought to them / for all the ſeruauntes of
the howſe were gladde of theyr delyueraunce / 
for they were ſory of that caſe / howbeit they myght
fynde no remedy / it behoued them to obey
theyr mayſters commaundement in ryght or
in wronge / and as ſoone as the caſtell gate was
ſhote and the brydge drawen / there entred nor
yſſued nother man nor woman / for the keyes
were in the dukes chambre / and he ſlepte tyll it
was .iii. of the clocke / and the knyghtes & ſquyers
that were without abydynge for theyr mayſters
were ſore abaſſhed and ſayd. Nowe our
ſeaſon and voyage by the ſee is loſt and broken
A conſtable what myſhap is fallen to you what
counſayle hath dyſceyued you / the counſayle ye
was made and aſſembled at Wannes was made
for none other entente but to atrappe you / ye
were wonte to be of the oppynyon that yf the duke
had ſente for you and hadde made you a. M.
aſſuraunces / yet ye wolde not haue gone nor come
at his commaundement / ye doubted hym ſo
ſore / and nowe ye wente ſymply at his deſyre / 
euery man thrughe the duchy of Bretayne complayned
for the conſtable and wyſt not what to
do nor ſay / and all knyghtes and ſquyers ſayd / 
what do we here / why do we not go and encloſe
the duke in his caſtel of Ermyne / and yf he haue
ſlayne the conſtable / ſerue hym in lyke maner / &
yf he kepe hym in pryſon let vs doo ſoo that we
maye haue hym agayne / there fell neuer ſuche
a myſchefe in Bretayne / thus one & other ſayd / 
But there were none that ſtyred forwarde but
taryed to here other newes. Thus tydynges
ſpred abrode ſoo that within two dayes it was
at Parys / wherwith the kynge and his vncles
the duke of Berrey and the duke of Borgoyne
had grete meruayle / as then ye duke of Borbon
was gone to Aupgnyon to go in to Caſtell and
had ſene the pope Clement on his way / theſe tydynges
came to hym as he was at Lyon ſure le
Rone / and with hym the erle of Sauoy.
            ANd the erle of ſaynt Poule / the lorde of
Coucy and admyrall of fraunce beynge
at Harflewe redy to haue entred in to the ſee towarde
theyr voyage when they herde howe the
duke of Bretayne hadde taken the conſtable of
fraunce pryſoner in his caſtell of Ermyne / and
the lorde de la vale and the lorde of Beawmanoyre
with hym. And they that brought thoſe
tydynges ſayd howe the bruyte ranne in Bretayne
howe the duke of Bretayne hadde putte
to dethe the conſtable of Fraunce / and the lorde
of Beawmanoyre. Theſe were harde tydynges
to theſe lordes / and they ſayd. Nowe our
voyage is broken / lette vs gyue leue to all our
men of warre to departe and let vs goo to Parys
to the kynge and ſe what he wyll do / then ye
admyrall ſayd / it is good we do ſoo / but let not
our men departe / peraduenture the kynge wyll
ſende them to ſome other parte / may happen in
to Caſtell for ye duke of Borbon is goynge thyder / 
or elles peraduenture he wyl ſende them in
to Bretayne to make warre agaynſt the duke.
thynke you yt ye frenſſhe kynge wyl ſuffre ye matter
thus to ouerpas. Nay ſurely for ye kyng ſhal
receyue by this bergayne domage to the ſome
of .ii. C. M. floreynes beſyde ye loſſe and hurte
that is done to his conſtable / yf he ſcape the lyfe
was there euer caſe lyke. Thus ye kynge to breke
his voyage who was in good mynde to haue
done domage to his enemyes. Let vs tary
here ſtyll a .ii. or .iii. dayes / and peraduenture
we ſhall here ſome other tydynges out of fraunce
or out of Bretayne.
         
         
            ¶Howe wrytynges were made
at the duke of Bretaynes deuyſe / 
for the conſtable to rendre his towne
and caſtelles to the duke / and
to his heyres for euer / and howe
they were delyuered to the duke.
Ca. lxxxvi.
            
               HOwe let vs ſpeke a lytell
of the duke of Bretayne
who when he hadde ſlepte
roſe and made hym redy / &
then he ſente for the lorde de
la vale who came to hym / &
there they were togyder a
longe ſpace. Fynally letters were wryten accordynge
to the dukes wyll / makynge mencyon yt
               
the conſtable ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon renounced
clene his tytle for euer of the ſayd towne and caſtell
and yelded them purely to the duke of Bretayne
and to his heyres for euer / and that / theſe
wrytynges ſholde be permanent without ony
repell / and then ye lorde of Beawmanoyre was
ordeyned by the conſtable to goo to theſe caſtelles
and to cauſe them that had the rule of them
to departe thens / and to put in poſſeſſyon ye dukes
men / and beſyde that to leuy in redy money
a .C.M. frankes to pay to the duke. When all
this was concluded the gates of the caſtell was
opened and the lorde of Beawmanoyre yſſued
our charged and ordeyned by ye conſtable to accomplyſſhe
all theſe ordeynaunces / and he was
deſyred to make al the dylygence that myght be
And with hym wente ſeruauntes of the dukes / 
& noyſed as they wente howe the conſtable was
ſure of his lyfe 
                  •
               and was put to raunſome / all ſuche
as loued hym knyghtes and ſquyers were
glad therof and ſo therby ſate ſtyll / for they were
determyned to haue gone and layde ſyege to
the caſtell of Ermyne and haue cloſed the duke
therin / they neuer dyd thynge that they wolde
haue ben gladder of. So theſe tydynges ranne
abrode with the wynde / ſo that the lordes and
knyghtes beyng at Harflewe herde therof and
had certayne knowledge that the conſtable had
ben deed and the lorde de la vale had not ben / &
they ſayd as for the delyueraunce of his towne
and caſtelles he ſhall recouer them agayne / or
elles other at tyme & leyſure / the frenſſhe kynge
hath ynowe for hym yf he nede. Nowe we maye
departe fro hens / our voyage is broken let vs
gyue our men leue to departe / and let vs goo to
Parys and lerne tydynges there / for we here
ſaye that all ſuche as were at Lentrygnyer are
countermaunded / ye whiche is a ſygne that we
ſhal go no where at this ſeaſon / thus they gaue
lycence to al theyr men of warre to departe and
themſelfe departed towarde Parys where the
kynge was.
            THe lorde of Beawmanoyre dyd ſo moche
that within .iiii. dayes he had ſet the
duke of Bretaynes ſeruauntes in poſſeſſyon of
the foreſayd caſtelles and towne of Iugon / and
after he payde the .C.M. frankes for the conſtables
raunſome there as the duke commaunded
when all was done the lorde de la vale ſayd to
ye duke / ſyre haue nowe that you demaunded
the .C.M. frankes the towne of Iugon / the caſtell
of Boureke and the whyte caſtell of Ioſſelyn / 
therfore ſyr nowe delyuer me the conſtable
I am contente ſayd the duke let hym goo when
he wyll I gyue hym leue / thus ye conſtable was
delyuered and he and the lorde de la vale departed
fro the caſtell of Ermyne / when they were
abrode in the feldes / ye conſtable made no longe
taryenge in Bretayne / but mounted on a good
horſe and his page on another and ſo rode that
within two dayes he came to Paris and alyghted
at his owne howſe and then wente to the caſtel
of Lowre to the kynge & his vncles the duke
of Berrey and of Borgoyne / his men folowed
after hym at theyr leyſure / the kynge knewe of
his delyueraunce / but he knewe not that he was
ſo nere / and was glad when he herde therof and
cauſed the chambre dores to be ſet open agaynſt
hym and ſo he came in to the kynges preſence &
kneled downe before hym and ſayd. Ryght redoubted
lorde / your fader whome god pardon
made me conſtable of Fraunce / whiche offyce
to my power I haue well and truely exercyſed
and yf there be ony excepte your grace and my
lordes your vncles that wyll ſaye that I haue
not acquyted myſelfe truely or done ony thyng
contrary to the crowne of fraunce I am here redy
to caſt my gage in that quarell / the kynge
nor none other made none anſwere to thoſe wordes / 
then he ſayd further / ryght dere ſyr and noble
kynge it fortuned in Bretayne in doynge of
myne offyce / the duke of Bretayne toke me and
helde me in his caſtell of Ermyne / and wolde
haue put me to deth without reaſon by reaſon
of his fyers courage / and god had not ben and
the lorde de la vale / ſo that I was conſtrayned
if I wolde be delyuered out of his handes / to delyuer
to hym a towne of myne in Bretayne and
iii. caſtelles / and the ſome of a .C.M. frankes / 
Wherfore ryght dere ſyr and noble kynge the
blame and domage that the duke of Bretayne
hath done gretely regardeth your mageſte royall
for y• voyage that I and my company ſholde
haue made by the ſee is broken / Wherfore ſyr I
yelde vp the offyce of the conſtableſhyp / ſyr prouyde
for another ſuche as ſhall pleaſe you / for I
wyll noo more bere the charge therof / I ſholde
haue none honoure to do it. Conſtable ſayd the
kynge we knowe well that ye haue hurte and
domage and is a thynge gretely to the preiudyce
to our royalme. We wyll incontynente ſende
for the peres of Fraunce to ſe what ſhall be beſt
to be done in this caſe / therfore take ye no thought
for ye ſhal haue ryght and reaſon. ¶Then
the kynge toke the conſtable by the hande and
reyſed hym vp and ſayd. Conſtable we wyl not
that ye departe from your offyce in this maner

But we wyll that ye vſe it tyll we take other
counſayle. Then the conſtable kneled downe
agayne and ſayd. Syr this matter toucheth
me ſoo nere that I cannot vſe it. The offyce is
grete / for I muſt ſpeke and anſwere euery man
& I am ſo troubled that I can anſwere no man.
Wherfore ſyr I requyre your grace to prouyde
for another for a ſeaſon / and I ſhall alwayes be
redy at your commaundement / ſyr ſayd the duke
of Borgoyne he offereth ynoughe ye ſhall take
aduyſe / it is true ſayd the kynge. Then the
conſtable aroſe and wente to the duke of Berre
and to the duke of Borgoyne and aduyſed
to ſhewe them his buſynes / and to enforme thē
iuſtely all the matter / ſeynge the caſe touched
them gretely in that they had the gouernynge
of the royalme / but in ſpekynge with them and
herynge the hole matter / they perceyued ye matter
touched not them ſoo ſore as he made of / ſoo
that fynally they blamed hym for goynge to
Wannes / ſayenge to hym / ſyth your nauy was
redy and that knyghtes and ſquyers taryed for
you at Lentrygnyer. ¶And alſo when ye were
at Wannes and hadde dyned with the duke
and retourned agayne to your caſtell of Bourke / 
what had you then ony thynge to do to tary
there ony longer nor to goo agayne to the duke
to the caſtell of Ermyne. Syr ſayd the conſtable
he ſhewed me ſoo fayre ſemblaunt that I
durſt not refuſe it. Conſtable ſayd the duke of
Borgoyne / in fayre ſemblauntes are grete decepcyons / 
I repute you more ſubtel then I take
you nowe / go your way / y• matter ſhall do well
ynoughe / we ſhall regarde it at leyſure. Then
the conſtable perceyued well that theſe lordes
were harder and ruder to hym then the kynge
was. Soo he departed and wente to his owne
lodgynge / and thyder came to hym certayne of
the lordes of the parlyament to ſe hym and ſayd
to hym that the matter ſholde doo ryght well / 
and alſo there came to hym to counſayle hym
the erle of ſaynt Poule / the lorde of Coucy and
the admyrall of Fraunce / and they ſayd to hym
Conſtable make noo doubte / for ye ſhall haue
reaſon of the duke of Bretayne / for he hath done
agaynſt the crowne of Fraunce grete dyſpleaſure
and worthy to be ſhamed and put out of
his countrey / goo your wayes and paſſe the tyme
at Mount le Herry / there ye ſhal be on your
owne / and let vs alone with the matter / for the
peres of Fraunce wyll not ſuffre the matter to
reſt thus. The conſtable byleued theſe lordes
and ſo departed fro Parys and rode to Mount
le Herry. Soo the offyce of conſtableſhyp was
voyde for a ſeaſon as it was ſayd that ſyr Guy
of Tremoyle ſholde be conſtable / but it was
not ſoo / he was ſoo well aduyſed that he wolde
not take it out of the handes of ſyr Olyuer of
Clyſſon.
         
         
            ¶Howe tydynges came to the
frenſſhe kynge from the partyes
of Almayne the whiche
were to hym ryght dyſpleaſaunt
and vnto his vncles.
Ca. lxxxvii.
            
               THe ſame weke that tydynges
came to Parys of
the takynge of the conſtable
there came alſo tydynges
frome the partyes of Almayne / 
whiche were ryght dyſpleaſaunt
to the kynge and
to his vncles / I ſhall ſhewe you how and wherfore / 
the duke of Guerles ſone to the duke of Iulyers
was alyed with the kynge of Englande
to make warre agaynſt Fraunce / and hadde taken
a pencyon of foure thouſande frankes by
the yere / whiche pencyon the duke of Iulyers
his fader hadde in tyme paſt out of the kynge
of Englandes cofers / but or he dyed he renounced
it / and then his ſone who was but yonge toke
it agayne at the kynge of Englandes deſyre
ſo that he wolde defye the frenſſhe kynge and to
make warre agaynſt hym / and he was enclyned
to take the englyſſhe parte bycauſe he had
warre with the lady of Brabant / for he ſawe
well that the duchy of Brabant was fauourable
to the royalme of fraunce / for it ſholde after
retourne to the duke of Borgoyne and to his
chyldren. Therfore the duke of Guerles wolde
ſhewe that the matter touched hym ſo nere that
he wolde doo the domage that he myght to the
royalme of Fraunce and to all theyr alyes. So
he ſente letters of defyaunce to ye frenſſhe kynge
whiche were no thynge pleaſaunt / accepted of
the kynge nor of his counſayle as I ſhall ſhewe
you hereafter in the hyſtory when it ſhall be conuenyent
to ſpeke therof in the ſhewynge of the
warre of Bretayne and of Guerles / the frenſſhe
kynge made noo ſemblaunt therof / but made

good chere to the ſquyer of Guerles who hadde

ſo by reaſon of theſe tydynges ye courte of fraunce
was ſore troubled / and the frenſſhe counſayle
was ſore troubled when the conſtable of fraunce
came and made his complaynte of the duke
of Bretayne / for they ſawe well that trouble &

men aſſayled the towne of Aurene
and toke it / for it gaue vp

               HEre before ye haue
herde how dedes of armes
were done bytwene ſyr Iohan
Holande and ſyr Raynolde
of Roy in the preſence
of the kynge of Portyngale
and his wyfe / and at
the kynges departynge he
promyſed to the duke that as ſoone as he was
retourned to the cyte of Porte / that he wolde
not tary paſt .vi. dayes / but that his army ſholde
ſette forthe. Thenne the duke ſente Conſtaunce
his wyfe to the towne of ſaynt Iames
vnder the guydynge of the lorde Fythwater / 
a grete baron of Englande with a hundred ſperes
and two hundred archers and ye duke ſayd
to her. Madame ye ſhall kepe you in the cyte

yf euer we ſhall haue ony thynge in the royalme
of Caſtell or not. Syr ſayd the lady as god
wyll ſo be it / thus they departed for that preſent
tyme / and ſyr Thomas Percy / and the lorde
Fythwaren conueyed the duches with two hundred
ſperes out of all daungers / and thenne retourned
to the duke who was as then departed
fro Beſances towardes a towne in Galyce named
Aurene whiche rebelled agaynſt hym and
wolde not obey bycauſe it was ſtronge & therin
a garyſon of Bretons who hadde on theyr parelles
vndertaken to kepe it / and they had well
fortefyed it bycauſe they hadde knowledge that
the duke wolde come thyder / the marſhall of the
dukes ooſt hadde well herde howe they of Aurene
in Galyce wolde not obey / but dayly fortefyed
them / he counſayled the conſtable to goo
thyder / and ſoo euery man drewe to that parte / 
and ſoo came and lodged nere to it / the ſeaſon
was fayre aboute the Aſcencyon tyme / then tentes
and pauylyons were pyght vp in the fayre
playnes vnder the Olyues / and ſoo laye al that
fyrſt nyght / and the nexte day without gyuyng
of ony aſſaulte / thynkynge that the towne wolde
haue gyuen vp / and in dede the men of the
towne wolde gladly haue yelded them. But
the lordes and capytaynes wolde not ſuffre thē
who were Bretons and companyons aduenturers
two Bretons were capytaynes called the
baſto
                  •
                of Alroy / and the other the baſtarde of
Peneforte / they were good men of warre and
that well appered in that they toke on them to
kepe yt towne ſo farre out of all ſocour agaynſt
the duke of Lancaſtre.
            ON the .iii. daye that the Englyſſhemen
were thus lodged aboute the
towne and had well regarded howe
they myght at theyr aduauntage / 
aſſayle the towne. Thenne the conſtable / the

marſhall and the admyrall cauſed theyr trompettes
to ſounde to the aſſaulte / and then euery
man drewe forth in to the felde / and there
deuyded them in to .iiii. bandes to aſſayle the
towne iii .iiii. partes / & ſo in goodly ordre approched
the towne and taryed on the dykes / 
wherin there was no water. But it was well
fortefyed with pales and hedges / then the aſſaulte
began iii .iiii. partes. Then men of armes
and other wente downe in to the dykes
with axes in theyr handes and therwith cutte
downe the hedges / & they within caſt downe
dartes and other thynges that yf they hadde
not ben well paueſſed / there hadde ben many
ſore hurte and ſlayne. And alſo on the edge of
the dyke the archers ſhotte ſo fyerſly that they
within durſte not appere / the duke of Lancaſtre
came to beholde the aſſaulte whiche made
it ye more fyerſer / he ſate there on horſbacke
the ſpace of thre houres / he had ſuche pleaſure
to regarde thē / at this fyrſt aſſaulte the dykes
were clenſed of all the thycke hedges ſoo that
men myght goo to the pales / then the retrayte
was ſowned for that day / thē the duke ſayd to
the marſhal / ſyr Thomas our men haue done
theyr deuoyre for this daye / let them withdrawe
and caſe themſelfe / ſyr it ſhal be done ſayd
the marſhall / ſo ye aſſaulte was ſeaſed & euery
man wente to his lodgynge / and the hurte to
be dreſſed / and ſo paſſed that nyght / they had
wynes to drynke plentye / but they were ſoo
hoote and myghty that it was moche payne
to drynke them / and ſuche as dranke of them
without water were in that caſe yt they coulde
not helpe themſelfe the nexte day.
            THe nexte day it was aduyſed that they
ſholde make none aſſaulte bycauſe the
daye was ſoo hoote / and theyr men ſoo wery
and ouercome with ſtronge wynes / but determyned
that the nexte daye after they ſholde
begyn theyr aſſaulte at the ſone ryſynge / and
to endure tyll .iii. of the clocke at after noone / 
& ſo euery man was cōmaunded to take theyr
eaſe tyll they herde the ſowne of the marſhalles
trompet / and the ſame daye ye duke of Lancaſtre
herde tydynges of the kynge of Portyngale
howe he was departed fro the cyte of
Porte / and drewe towardes the porte ſaynt
yrayne / that waye he was purpoſed to entre
in to Caſtell and bothe ooſtes to mete on the
ryuer of Derne beſyde ye towne of perpygnen
or elles before the towne of Arpent / thus the
Portyngales had deuyſed / if the kynge of Caſtell
and the frenſſhe men dyd not encountre
them before / and yf they were lykely ſo to doo
then to drawe togyder ſoner / of theſe tydynges
the duke was ryght ioyous and gaue the
meſſagere for his tydynges .x. nobles.
            
               ANd in the mornynge whenne it was
daye the marſhalles trompet began
to ſowne before ye lodgynges to reyſe
vp euery man / then knyghtes and ſquyers began
to make them redy euery man vnder his
owne ſtanderde. Then the marſhall drewe in
to the felde / and all ſuche as were ordeyned to
goo to ye aſſaulte / they of the towne had knowledge
howe the Englyſſhemen wolde aſſayle
them by theyr watche men who had herde the
merſhalles trompet / then the Bretons reyſed
vp euery man and woman in the towne and
ſayd to them / ſyrs ſhewe yourſelfe lyke good
men and be not abaſſhed for nothynge that ye
ſe / we are ſtronge ynoughe / we haue dartes
and ſperes and ſtones and other artyllery ſuffycyent
to withſtande our enemyes / and if the
worſte fall at all tymes they wyll take vs to
mercy / worſe they can not doo to vs / we haue
ben or this in dyuers places farre febler then
this is / and yet we haue kepte it without daū
               ger
or domage / ſoo by reaſon of theyr wordes
the Galycyens were incouraged / for of themſelfe
they hadde rather haue yelded them vp / 
for accordynge to trouthe the comons in Caſtell
and Galyce are lytell worth in batayle / 
they are but euyll armed and ſmall of courage.
The gentyll men are ryght good on horſe
backe.
            THus the Englyſſhemen redy apparelled
to the aſſaulte aboute
the ſone ryſynge came in to the
dykes iuſte vnto the pales / and
with ares and other wepons bet downe the
pales to theyr feete / but yet for all that they
were not on the walle / for thenne they hadde
another dyke to paſſe as large as the other
was / thenne with moche payne they paſſed
that dyke and came to the walles. And when
they within ſawe them come ſoo nere they defended
themſelfe valyauntly. ¶Thenne the

Galycyens caſt out dartes in ſuche wyſe that
whome ſoo euer they ſtrake were ſoore hurte
without he were well paueſſed / Thenne they
reyſed vp ladders for to mounte vp too the
walles. There knyghtes and ſquyers auaunced
themſelfe to mounte with targyes ouer
theyr heedes / and ſwordes in theyr handes / 
and ſo came and fought hande to hande with
the Bretous who defended themſelfe ryght
nobly / for I repute it for a grete valyauntues
that they wol
                  •
               e abyde the aſſaulte / for they
knewe well they ſholde haue as thenne no ſocoure.
For it was determyned bytwene the
kynge of Caſtell and the Frenſſhe men to ſuffre
the Englyſſhmen at that tyme to do what
they lyft in Galyce or elles where and to paſſe
without batayle. Then ſome of the englyſſhe
men ſayd yf other townes in Caſtell gyue vs
as moche to doo as this doth it ſhall be longe
or we wynne the royalme / and thenne other
ſayd / there is moche pyllage within the towne
brought thyder out of all the countrey aboute.
And therfore they are lothe to yelde vp
the towne. Thenne ſome demaunded who
were capytaynes within ye towne / and ſuche
as knewe them ſayd / two baſterdes Bretons
borne good men of armes and experte in all
ſyeges / and the one is called the baſtarde of
Pennefort / and the other the baſterde of Aulroy / 
but what ſoeuer they be they be valyaunt
men of armes / for they ſe none apparence of
ſocoure / and yet they wyll not yelde vp. And
ſuche as were mounted vp were beten downe
agayne perforce. And when the duke of Lancaſtre
was vp and redy and herde the bruyre
of the aſſaulte ſayd he wolde goo and beholde
them / and ſoo lepte on a courſer and vnarmed
rode to the aſſaulte and his ſtanderde before
hym with the hele armes of Englande and of
Fraunce / and at his comynge the aſſaulte encreaſed.
Thenne euery man auaunced hymſelfe
to gete lawde and prayſe / and in lyke wyſe
they within. Whenne they ſawe that the duke
was there / they enforced themſelfe to ſhewe
theyr valyauntnes. Thus in aſſaylynge
and defendynge they contynued tyll it was
thre of the clocke. And it was not apparent
that they ſholde haue wonne ye towne at that
aſſaulte. Thenne the duke demaunded who
were capytaynes within the towne / and it
was ſhewed hym. Thenne he ſayd I wolde
the marſhall ſholde ſpeke with them to know
yf they wyll yelde them or not / I thynke they
haue not as yet ben demaūded / wherfore byd
the marſhall come & ſpeke with me / A knyght
wente to hym and ſayd. Syr my lorde ye duke
wolde ye ſholde come & ſpeke with hym / then
he came to ye duke / & the duke ſayd. Marſhall
knowe ye yf theſe Bretons wyl put themſelfe
vnder myne obeyſaunce or not / we trauayle
ſore our men / and there be dyuers of them ſore
hurte / and we waſte our artyllery / and we
can not tell when we ſhall haue nede therof.
Wherfore I praye you goo to them and take
ſome treatye with them. Syr ſayd he it ſhall
be done / ſyth ye wyll take them to mercy it is
reaſon they be herde ſpeke.
            
               THen the marſhall wente from the
duke to ye aſſaulte and ſayd to an
Heraulte / go thy way & fynde the
meanes to ſpeke with ye capytaynes
within the towne & ſhewe thē
how I wolde ſpeke with them. The heraulte
departed and wente in to the dykes with his
cote armure on his backe with the armes of
the duke of Lancaſtre / and ſoo his comoany
made hym waye by the commaundement of
the marſhall. The baſtarde of Alroy ſawe wel
the heraulte and ſo came to the wall and ſayd
Heraulte what wolde you / I am one of the capytaynes / 
I thynke ye be ſente to me / that is
trewe ſyr ſayd the heraulte / who was called
Percy. And ſyr the marſhall deſyreth you to
come to the barryers and ſpeke with hym / I
am contente ſayd the baſtarde / ſoo that ye cauſe
your men to leue the aſſaulte / otherwyſe I
wyll not come / I thynke that ſhall be ſoone
done ſayd the heraulte / and ſoo he retourned
to the marſhall and ſhewed hym as ye haue
herde. ¶Then the marſhall called his trompet
and cauſed hym to blowe the retrayte and
ſoo he dydde / thenne the aſſaulte ſeaſed on all
partyes. Thenne the capytaynes came to the
barryers / and there was redy the marſhal ſyr
Iohn̄ Holande / and ſyr Thomas Moreaus / 
and dyuers other Englyſſhemen. Syrs ſayd
the Englyſſhemen wyll ye be taken perforce
and be vtterly loſt and ſlayne poore and ryche / 
We knowe well that the comonte of the
towne wolde gladly yelde them to my lorde ye
duke and to my lady the duches / for they had
gyuen vp this towne or this and ye had not
ben / wherfore yf ye be taken it is euyll for you

and one thynge ye maye be ſure of / We wyll
not departe hence tyll we haue it / outher by
fayre meanes or otherwyſe / therfore ſpeke ye
togyder and aduyſe you and gyue me an anſwere / 
for I knowe my charge. Syr ſayd the
baſterde we are agreed all redy togyder / and
that is yf ye wyll cauſe vs ſurely to be conduyted
to the towne of Arpent without daunger
or peryll / we ſhall yelde vp the towne to you
Soo that the men and wom
                  •
               n within maye
lyue in peas and ſurety vnder the obeyſaunce
of the duke in lyke maner as other townes
do in Galyce / and none otherwyſe / we knowe
well ye be the marſhall of the ooſt and that all
treatyes perteyneth to you / and what ſoeuer
ye do the duke wyll agree to the ſame / that is
trewe ſayd ſyr Thomas / it ſhall be as ye deſyre / 
ſoo that ye bere with you nothynge but
that is your owne and not to robbe nor pyll
the towne / nor that ye haue wonne in ye countrey
for that may cauſe ryot to be made bytwene
you and our men / ſyr ſayd the baſtarde we
ſhall cary nothynge with vs but that is our
owne / and yf ony of our company haue bought
ony thynge of ony of the towne & are but
euyll payde / yet we ſhall make noo ryot therfore / 
I thynke as for mete and drynke ſyth we
came hyder in garyſon our men haue payde
no thynge as for that ſayd the marſhall is excepte / 
take all vytayle in aduauntage for ſoo
wyl our men do / but I ſay ye ſhall cary away
no mouables. Syr ſayd the barſtarde we be
not ſoo wyſe men but that ſome of our company
wyll take ſomwhat / Well ſayd ſyr Iohan
Holande let them paſſe that is theyr owne is
theyr owne / we wyl not go ſo nere them as to
ſerche theyr males / ſoo be it ſayd the marſhall
then there was an abſtynence made for that
daye / and the nexte daye they ſholde departe.
Then ye englyſſh men went to theyr lodgyng
and vnarmed them / and toke theyr eaſe and ye
Bretons all that daye truſſed and gad
                  •
               red togyder
grete pyllage that they had wonne before
in ye countrey of Caſtell for all was abandened
to them / ſoo that therby ſuche as came
fyrſte in to that countrey wanne grete good / 
and ſo in the truſſynge of theyr baggage they
toke many thynges from the men of the towne
as clothe and fethers and other ſtuffe ſuche
as they founde. And when ony of ye poore men
ſpake to them ſayenge / ſyrs that good ye take
is none of yours it is our good ye brought it
not hyder / then ye Bretons wolde ſay agayne
holde your peas ye vyllaynes we haue a commyſſyon
of the kynge of Caſtell to paye ourſelfe
of our wages / ye wyll not paye vs / and
thoughe ye hadde payde vs well and truely
yet we muſt haue newe wages agayne / therfore
this that we take is our owne.
            THen the nexte daye the marſhall
lepte on his horſe and a .lx. ſperes
in his company and ſoo came to
the barryers of the towne & there
taryed a ſpace. Thenne the capytaynes of the
Bretons came thyder and the marſhall ſayd.
Syrs be ye redy to depart / ye ſyr ſayd they ſo
we may haue conduyte to guyde vs / whether
wyll you go ſayd the marſhall / to the towne
of Arpent ſayd they / well ſayd quod the marſhall /

called ſyr Steuen Stebery and ſayd
to hym / take .x. ſperes with you and brynge
theſe Bretons to Arpent and retourne you to
morowe / he dyd as he was commaunded and
ſoo guyded forthe theſe Bretons with moche
baggage. And whenne they were al departed
thenne the marſhall and his company entred
in to the towne / and the people of the towne
made hym grete reuerence / for many of them
thought it had ben ye duke hymſelfe / when the
marſhall ſawe theſe Bretons departe with ſo
grete caryage he demaunded of them of / the
towne yf they hadde taken away ony of theyr
goodes or not / ye ſyr truely ſayd they and yt
to a grete ſubſtaunce / Why dyd you not ſayd
the marſhall ſhewe me yt betymes / for I ſholde
haue cauſed them to haue rendred it agayne / 
ſyr ſayd they we durſt not for they thretened
to ſlee vs yf we ſpake therof / ſyr they be
curſed people / there is none of them but he is
a ſtronge thefe / it is noo meruayle thoughe
they robbe vs / for eche of thē wyll robbe other
The marſhall ſmyled and then he ſente for the
chefe men of the towne / and they came before
hym / then he made them to ſwere to holde the
towne of Aurene of the duke of Lancaſtre for
euer in lyke maner and fourme as the other
townes in Galyce hadde doone before.
            ¶Then he ordeyned newe offycers / and toke
of euery man theyr faythes and othes / and ſo
dranke and retourned to the duke in to the felde
vnder the ſhadowe of the Olyue trees / for

the hete of the ſone whiche was ſoo exceſſyue

noo man durſt ryde a foragynge tyll after the
houre of .iii. for the hete.
            
               THe greteſt ymagynacyon that
the duke hadde / was for that it
was ſhewed hym howe the kynge
of Caſtell was abrode & with
a grete armye comynge agaynſt
hym to fyght / for he ſawe well that he coulde
not perfytely come to the chalenge of Caſtell
but by force of batayle / and ſoo he ſente oute
ſpyes in to euery cooſt / but thenne it was ſurely
enfourmed hym by his ſpyes / and by pylgrymes
that the kynge of Caſtell made none
aſſembly for to come in to the felde / but kepte
hymſelfe and his men in garyſons. And alſo
that the duke of Borbon was not as then come
in to Caſtell nor no tydynges there of his

fyue dayes in the marches of Auranches / he
determyned to goo to Noye / and there to aſſaye
by aſſaulte to paſſe the brydge ouer the

conduyted the Bretons to the towne of Arpent
retourned agayne. And it was demaunded
of hym what company of men of warre
were there in garyſon / he ſayd howe ſyr Olyuer
of Cleſquy was there with a thouſande
ſperes Bretons and Frenſſhemen. Then the
conſtable and marſhall ſayd to the duke / ſyr

of Nowar to abyde there with a hundred ſperes
of Portyngales and Gaſcoynes ſuche as

and the fyrſt nyght lodged a thre legges
from the cyte of Porte / and the nexte daye departed
in thre batayles a fayre ſofte pace bycauſe
of his fote men wherof there were a .xii.
thouſande with all the caryage / and after the
kynge folowed with a thouſande ſperes / there
was with hym Don Galoys / Ferrant Partecke /

and tooke the waye to ſaynt yrayne by ſmall
iourneyes / for they toke theyr lodgynge euer

of Iuberoth and there taryed .ii. dayes / and
from thens at two iourneys they rode to Aurach

The kynge of Portyngale determyned
that bothe the caſtelles ſholde be aſſayled / for
he thought with his honoure he myght not

aſſaultes in his waye.
            
               
               THus the kynge of Portyngale and
his men lodged in the matches of
ſaynt yrayne whiche was the entre
in to the royalme of Caſtell all
a longe by the ryuer of Peſe rynnynge
to Syuyll the grete. By this foreſayd
ryuer myght well be brought in to the ooſt all
maner of thynges frome Lyxbone and frome
Porte / and ſoo they were a thyrty thouſande
one and other. The conſtable & his rowte with
halfe of the comonte laye before the caſtell Perrade
in to the eeſt parte & aboute ye other caſtell
in the weſt parte called Tayllydon lay ye marſhall
and his company / in the caſtell Perrade
was capytayne a knyght of Bretayne called ſyr
Moreys Fouchance an experte man of armes / 
and in the caſtell Tayllydon was ſyr Iaques
of Mountmellyer a knyght of Poyctou / and
eche of them hadde a .l. ſperes / the ſyege thus
lay a .xv. dayes without doynge of ony thynge
ſauynge there were engynes reyſed vp. And
they dydde caſt .x. or .xii. tymes a daye grete ſtones
agaynſt the walles / but lytell hurte they
dyd / but on the couerynge of the houſes / for the
houſes within were well vawted with ſtone / ſo
that the engynes nor ſpryngalles dyd the men
but ſmall domage / When the kynge ſawe that
the caſtelles wolde not be wonne / and that his
men began to waxewery / he determyned then
to dyſlodge and to entre in to Galyce and to approche
nerer to the duke of Lancaſtres ooſt to
the entente that they myght determyne togyder
what waye were beſt for them to take. Soo on
a day they dyſlodged and truſſed and departed
fro ſaynt yrayne / at whiche tyme they brente the
towne in ſuche wyſe that there was not a place
lefte vnbrente able to lodge in horſe / when they
of the caſtell ſawe them departe they were ryght
ioyous and ſowned theyr trompettes and
made grete chere and melody tyll they were all
paſte / that daye the ooſt wente and lodged at
Pount Ferraunt in Galyce / and the nexte daye
in the vale ſaynt Katheryne / and on the .iii. day
they came before Feroull in Galyce a ſtronge
towne holdynge on the kynge of Caſtelles parte / 
and there they reſted.
         
         
            ¶Howe the kynge of Portyngale and
his ooſt came before Feroull / and aſſaulted
it / and it was wonne and brought
vnder the obeyſaunce of the duke
of Lancaſtre. Ca. lxxxx.
            
               WHen the kynge of Portyngale
and his men were before
Feroull they founde there
a good countrey / and the
conſtable and marſhall ſayd
it ſholde be aſſaulted affyrmynge
howe it was preygnable / 
they were two dayes without ony aſſaulte
gyuynge truſtynge they wolde haue gyuen it
vp / but they dyd not / for within were Bretons
and Borgonyons that ſayd they wolde defende
it / by the thyrde daye the engynes were reyſed
vp / and the marſhall ſowned his trompettes
to the aſſaulte / then euery man made hym redy
to approche the towne / and they within whē
they herde the trompettes blowe to the aſſaulte
they drewe euery man to theyr defence and women
caryed and brought ſtoones to caſte / for in
Caſtell and Galyce women be of grete defence
and of grete courage in maner as grete as the
men / the Portyngales came to the dykes whiche
were depe / but there was no water in them
then they boldely entred in to the dykes and clymed
vp agayne on the other ſyde / but they had
moche a doo / ſauynge they were well paueſſed
for they on the walles caſte downe ſtoones and
hurte many and cauſed them to reeule / alſo ther
was good caſtynge of dartes bothe outwarde
and inwarde. Thus the aſſaulte endured tyll
it was thre of the clocke / and the men were fore
chaced / for the ſone was hoote / and they in the
dykes hadde none eyre nor wynde / ſo that they
thought they peryſſhed for hete / ſoo that therby
the aſſaulte ſeaſed / and all that ſeaſon the engynes
dydde caſte in to the towne at aduenture / 
thenne the marſhall counſayled noo moore to
aſſaulte the towne / but ſtyll to let the engynes
caſte and to ſcrymyſſhe at the barryers and to
ſhewe ſome dedes of armes and ſo as he deuyſed
it was doone / and dayly ſcrymyſſhes made
And they within often tymes were cloſed with
out the gate bytwene the barryers and the gate
for to ſcrymyſſhe moore at theyr eaſe. ¶And
whenne the marſhall of Portyngale ſawe theyr
maner he deuyſed theron and ſayd to ſyr Iohn̄
Ferrant / I ſe well the ſowdyours within at ſome
ſeaſon are cloſed bytwene the gate and the
barryers / let vs take a .v. or .vi.C. of our men &
laye a byſſhment & with a fewe perſones let vs
ſcrymyſſhe a whyle / & then withdrawe lytell &

lytell and we ſhall ſe that they wyll yſſue oute
on truſte to wynne ſome what of vs / thenne let
vs tourne agayne ſodaynely to the barryers
and buſye them ſomewhat / and thenne our enbuſſhe
of horſe men ſodeynly to come on them
And when they ſe that they wyll forſake theyr
barryers and open the gates to entre / and ſoo
peraduenture we may entre with them / and at
the leeſt yf they within open not the gate / they
that be without ſhal be al oures / that is true ſyr
ſayd ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant. Well ſayd the marſhall
who was called ſyr Alue Perreer / do you ye one
feate and I ſhall doo the other / goo you and ſyr
Martyne de Marlo / and Pomas de Congne
and kepe the enbuſſhe and I ſhall go and make
the ſcrymyſſhe it perteyneth to myne offyce / as
they deuyſed ſo they dyd / there were appoynted
out .v. C. horſe men for to kepe the enbuſſhe / &
ſo of .iii. dayes they made noo ſcrymyſſhe wherby
they within of the garyſon hadde meruayle
and ſayd to the galycyens within the towne / loye
vnhappy people / ye wolde haue gyuen vp
this towne at theyr fyrſte comynge and we had
not ben / We haue gretely preſerued the honoure
of your towne / for ye ſhal ſe the kynge of Portangale
and all his ooſt ſhortely departe hens
without doynge ony domage to vs.
            ON the fourthe daye the marſhall as
was deuyſed began the ſcrymyſſhe
with a ſmall company / and the horſe
men laye ſtyll pryuely in theyr buſſhment
and the Bretons within when they ſawe
theyr enemyes in truſt to gete ſome good pryſoner
opened theyr gate and lefte it ſtyll open to
the entente it ſholde be the more redyer at theyr
retourne / for they tryſted not gretely the Galycyens
within the towne / ſo they came to the barryers
and dyd there as it apperteyned to a ſcrymyſſhe / 
then when the marſhall ſawe his tyme
he made ſ
                  •
               mblaunt as thoughe he and his men
hadde ben wery and as halfe dyſcomfyted reculed
lytell and lytell / and when the Bretons ſaw
that they thought to haue wonne all and opened
theyr barryers all at ones and yſſued out.
and came out and toke .xxv. pryſoners / and they
hadde ſo moche haſte to gete them in to the towne
that they lefte theyr barryers ſtyll open / then
the marſhall made a ſygne to the buſſhement / 
and they brake out a .v.C. horſe and came more
then a galoppe and entred the barryers / and
when the Freniſhemen and Bretons ſawe that
they wolde haue reculed to theyr barryers but
they coulde not / for the Portyngales entred as
ſoone as they in to the towne. Thus was the
towne wonne and dyuers ſlayne / and the ſowdyours
that were therein garyſon were taken
pryſoners excepte ſuche as ſaued themſelfe by another
gate / and ſoo yſſued in to the feldes and
rode to Arpente where as ſyr Olyuer of Elyſquy
was and a thou
                  •
               ande ſperes with hym and
there they ſhewed howe the towne or Feroull
was loſt.
            THus as I haue ſhewed you fell of this
towne of Feroull in Galyce. The Portyngales
wanne it and dydde put it vnder the
obeyſaunce of the duke of Lancaſtre / in whoſe
tytle they made that warre. The kynge of Portyngale
was gretely reioyced of that his men
hadde done ſoo well / and incontynente he ſente
worde therof to the duke of Lancaſtre / ſhewynge
hym howe he hadde encreaſed his herytage / 
for he hadde wonne hym that towne and he truſted
to wynne moo. The duke was gretely reioyced
of thoſe tydynges who was as thē come
before Noy. Wherin was the Barroys of Barreys / 
and ſyr Iohn̄ of Chatelet Mouraunte / 
and ſyr Tryſtram de la Gayle / ſyr Raynolde
du Roy / ſyr Wyllyam of Mongteney and dyuers
other knyghtes and ſquyers of Fraunce.
And when the dukes marſhall ſawe the caſtell
of Noye he ſayd / loke as Coulongne is one of
the keyes of caſtell towarde the ſee / ſoo is this
caſtell of Noye another keye towardes Caſtell
for he is no lorde of Caſtell without he be lorde
of Coulongne and of Noye. Lette vs goo loke
what company there is there / it is ſhewed me
howe the Baroys of Barres an experte man of
armes of Fraunce is there / I thynke at the entrey
of the brydge we ſhall haue ſome ſcrymyſſh
Syr ſayd ſyr Lamburyne of Luners / and ſyr
Iohn̄ Dambreticourte that wolde we gladly
ſe. The vaungarde wherin were a .v.C. ſperes
of good men of armes rode forthe in good
ordre / and the duke ſente parte of his company
thyder to make the gretter muſtre / for he knewe
well that his marſhall wolde ſhewe there ſome
dedes of armes.
            
               WHen the watche of the caſtell ſawe
the vowarde approche he ſowned
alaram. Thenne the capytaynes
knewe incontynente that the Englyſſhmen
came thyder. They armed

them and put themſelfe in good ordre / they
were a hundred men of armes / and ſome came
to theyr barryers with a .xii. penons. But ſyr
Barroys of Barres was mooſt of reputacyon
¶And alſo he hadde the chefe charge / and alſo
ſyr Iohan of Chatell Morant was the nexte.
And when ſyr Thomas Moreaus marſhall of
the ooſt ſawe that he was nere the towne he alyghted
a foote and all his company / and delyuered
theyr horſes to theyr pages and ſo came togyder
to ye barryers with theyr ſperes in theyr
handes / and at euery .vi. paces they reſted to kepe
themſelfe cloſe togyder / it was a goodly ſyght
to beholde them / and ſo on a fronte they came
to the barryers / and there they were receyued
valy auntly / and I thynke yf they had ben
in the playne felde there had ben noo goodlyer
dedes of armes done then was done there / and
yet the barryers was bytwene them / and there
the marſhall without was matched wt ſyr Iohn̄
of ye chateau Morant within and eche of them
ſore trauayled to hurte eche other / but theyr armure
was ſo good that noone of them toke domage / 
and ſyr Thomas Percy was coped with
le Barroys and Mauburyn of Lyuyers with
ſyr wyllyam of Mongteney / and ſyr Iohn̄ Dā
bretycourte with ſyr Reynolde of Roy / and the
lorde Talbot with Tryſtram de la gayle / thus
they were matched and ſcrymyſſhed togyder wt
theyr ſperes / and when they were wery they reſted / 
and other knyghtes and ſquyers came / &
ſcrymyſſhed in theyr places / this ſcrymyſſhe endured
tyll hyghe noone / then archers came to ye
place / but then the gentylmen departed and ſet
croſſe bowes to ſhote agaynſt the englyſſhe archers
and ſpanyarde with dartes / and they ſcrymyſſhed
tyl it was paſt one of the clocke. Then
came other yomen and varlettes / and ſoo ſcrymyſſhed
tyll it was nyght. Then the englyſſhemen
retourned / and they of the caſtell retourned
in to theyr garyſon and made good watche
aboute halfe a legge frome the caſtell of Noye / 
alonge by the ryuers ſyde the Englyſſhe men
laye / the whiche ryuer dydde them grete eaſe
for theyr horſes / for they had grete lacke of water
tyll they came there / there they refreſſhed
them a .v. or .vi. dayes / and then wente before ye
towne of Arpente to ſe the dealynge of the conſtable
of Caſtell and of the frenſſhmen / and there
they herde tydynges of the kynge of Portyngale
who laye in the playnes of Feroull and all
his ooſt / and was in purpoſe to come to the towne
of Padron in Galyce / whiche was in ye waye
towarde the duke and the Englyſſhemen / and
there it was ordeyned that the kynge and ye duke
ſholde mete togyder to comon / and determyne
howe they ſholde perceyuer in theyr warre.
¶They had ben a moneth a brode in the countrey
and hadde nere hande brought all Galyce
in to theyr obeyſaunce / and they coulde here no
tydynges of ye kynge of Caſtel nor of ye frenſſhe
men / Wherfore they hadde grete meruayle / for
it was ſayd yt the kynge of Caſtel had ſomoned
his people at Burgus fro all the partyes of the
royalme / as of Caſtell / Syuell / Cordowayne / 
Collede / Spayne / Lyon / Struges / Vale olyue
and of Sury / and yt he had .lx.M. men / and
vi .M. ſperes of pure frenſſhe men. And howe
that thyder ſholde come ye duke of Borbon who
as it was ſayd was departed out of Fraunce to
come thyder / therfore the Portyngales and the
Englyſſhmen thought to drawe togyder to be
the more ſtronger and redyer yf theyr enemyes
come on them / and they byleued theſe tydynges
to be of trouthe / wherfore they were ioyfull / for
they wolde gladly haue made an ende by batayle / 
for otherwyſe they ſawe well they coulde not
atteyne to theyr deſyred entrepryſe / and ſyr Wyllyam
of Lygnac / and ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac
were alwayes aboute the kynge of Caſtell / and
euery weke they had tydynges out of Fraunce
what buſynes there was there / and of the departynge
of the duke of Borbon / and howe he toke
in his waye of Auygnyon to ſe pope Clement
and the cardynalles there / euer they counſayled
the kynge not to fyght tyll the duke of Borbon
were come / and amonge other tydynges they
herde of the duke of Bretayne howe he had taken
in the caſtell of Ermyne ye conſtable of fraū
               ce / 
and raunſomed at a .C.M. frankes and of
his .iii. caſtelles and towne that was delyuered
to the duke of Bretayne / and howe that therby
the iourney and boyage in to Englande was
broken / they had meruayle of this / and to what
purpoſe the duke of Bretayne dyd it / they ſuppoſed
that the counſayle therof came out of Englande.
            THus as I haue ſayd before the royalme
of Fraunce was brought in
to trouble / and ſpecyally the kynges
vncles were ſore moued with
the defyaunce that came fro the duke of Guerles / 
for they were fell and rude and out of the
courſe of other defyaunces as I ſhall ſhewe you
when I declare the matter. And alſo the frenſſh
kynge and his vncles were ſore dyſpleaſed in yt
               
the duke of Bretayne had broken theyr voyage
in to Englande by ye ſee / and he that was chefe
of the entrepryſe taken / that was the conſtable
of fraunce and raunſomed as before is ſayd at
a .C.M. frankes & taken fro hym .iii. caſtelles
and a towne / whiche was a thynge gretely preiudycyall
to the kynge and to the royalme of
fraunce / howbeit the kynge ſonne paſſed ouer
all the matters / for he was but yo
                  •
               ge / wherfore
he regarded it not ſo ſore as though he had ben
of perfyte age / but ſuche as were auncyent and
wyſe ſayd yt by ſuche lyke matters the royalme
of fraunce hath had moche a do in tyme paſt / as
when the kynge of Nauare cauſed ſyr Charles
of Spayne conſtable of Fraunce to be ſlayne / 
for whiche cauſe kynge Iohn̄ neuer loued after
the kynge of Nauare and toke fro hym all his
landes in Normandy. Then ſome other wolde
ſaye yf kynge Charles fader to the kynge that
nowe is were a lyue (he loued the conſtable ſoo
well) ſurely he wolde be reuenged and make
warre to the duke of Bretayne and to take fro
hym all his landes what ſoo euer it coſt hym.
Thus euery man ſpake of this dede / and ſayd
it was euyll done / then the kynges vncles and
the counſayle of the royalme / ſomwhat to ſatyſfye
the people who were ſore dyſpleaſed with ye
duke of Bretayne determyned that a prelate &
.iii. barons ſholde be ſente to the duke to ſpeke
with hym and to here his reaſons / & to commaū
               de
hym to come to Parys to make his exſcuſe of
yt he had done / thyder ſholde go the byſſhop of
Beawuoys / and ſyr Myles of Dornams a ſage
and a ryght valyaunt man / and well langaged / 
and with hym ſyr Iohn̄ of Bean / ſyr Iohn̄
of Beuell / and the lorde de la Ryuer who had
theyr charge what they ſholde ſaye and do / and
the byſſhoppe of Beaw
                  •
               oys toke his waye by
Mount le herry where as the conſtable was / 
for ye towne of Caſtell perteyned to hym kynge
Charles had gyuen it to hym and to his heyres
And whyle the byſſhop was there a ſykenes toke
hym and ſo lay in a feuer a .xv. dayes & dyed / 
then in his ſtede was ſente the byſſhop of Langers
and he toke his waye with the other in to
Bretayne.
            IT myght be demaunded of me howe I
knewe all theſe matters to ſpeke ſo proprely
of them. I anſwere to all ſuche / that I haue
made grete dylygence in my dayes to knowe it
and haue ſerched many royalmes & countreys
to come to the true knowledge of all ye matters
conteyned in this hyſtory wryten and to be wryten / 
for god gaue me the grace to haue the layſure
to ſe in my dayes / and to haue the acquayntaunce
of all the hyghe and myghty prynces &
lordes as well in Fraunce as in Englande / for
for in the yere of our lorde god a .M.iiiC.iiii.
ſcore and .x. I had laboured .xxxvii. yeres / and
as then I was of the age of .lvii. yeres / and in
.xxxvii. yeres a man beynge in ſtrength and wel
reteyned in euery cooſt as I was (for after my
yonge dayes I was in the kynge of englandes
courte .v. yeres with the quene. And alſo I was
welcome to kynge Iohn̄ of Fraunce & to kynge
Charles his ſone) myght well lerne many thynges / 
and ſurely it was alwayes my chefe ymagynacyon
and pleaſure to enquyre & to retayne
it by wrytynge / and howe I was enfourmed of
the takynge of the conſtable of Fraunce I ſhall
ſhewe you. A yere after this matter fell I rode
from the cyte of Angyers to Towres in Towrayne.
And I laye on a nyght at Beauforte in ye
vale / and the nexte day I met with a knyght of
Bretayne called ſyr Wyllyam Daucemys / he
was rydynge to ſe my lady of Mayll in Towrayne
his coſyne & her chyldren / she was newly
a wydowe / & I fell in aquayntaunce with this
knyght and founde hym ryght curtoys & ſwete
of wordes / then I demaunded of hym ſome tydynges
and ſpecyally of the takynge of the conſtable / 
whiche matter I was glad to here and
to knowe the trouth therof / and he ſhewed me &
ſayd howe he had ben at ye parlyament at wannes
with ye lorde of Aucemys his coſyne a grete
baron of Bretayne. And in lyke maner as ſyr
Eſpayne de Lyon enfourmed me of all thynges
that had fallen in Foyze in Byerne / & in gaſcoyne / 
& alſo as ſyr Iohn̄ Ferrant parteke ſhewed
me of all the matters of Portyngale / and of Caſtell.
In lyke maner this knyght ſhewed me many
thynges / and more wolde haue done if I had
ryden longer in his company. Thus bytwene
Mounte le herry and Premylly was .iiii. grete
leages and we rode but ſoftely / and in this way
he ſhewed me many thynges / ye whiche I bare
well in my remembraunce / and ſpecyally of the
aduentures of Bretayne. And thus as we rode
& that we came nere to Premylly / we entred in
to a medowe there this knyght reſted and ſayd
A god haue mercy of the ſoule of the good conſtable
of Fraunce / he dydde here ones a goodly
iourney and profytable for the royalme vnder
the baner of ſyr Iohn̄ de Bewell for he was not
as then conſtable but newly come out of Spayne / 
and I demaunded of hym howe it was / I
ſhal ſhewe you ſayd he whē I am on horſebacke

and ſo we mounted: than we rode forthe fayre
and eaſely / and as we rode he ſayde.
            In the ſeaſon that I haue ſhewed you quod
this knight / this countre here was full of Englyſſhmen / 
robbers and pyllers of Gaſcoyne
bretons and almayns / and aduenturers of all
nacions: For all the countre on bothe ſydes of
the ryuer of Loyre / were replenyſſhed with
them: For the warre bytwene Fraūce and Englande
was newly renewed / ſo that all maner
of theues and robbers entred in to this countrey / 
for here they aſſembled and fortifyed thē
ſelfe / to conquere the caſtell of Beauforde in
the valey / that ye ſawe but late / was in their
handes / and all the countrey about. Thus to
come to my purpoſe / the Englyſſhmen & gaſcoyns
had in their handes / the towne and caſtell
of Prinulley / and had gretly fortifyed it.
And they helde alſo other ſmalle fortereſſes a
longe by the ryuer of Loyre: And whan ſo euer
they wolde ryde / they were to the nombre
bytwene a thouſande and eyght hundred fightynge
men: Than ſir Bertram / ſir Iohan of
Beull / and the lorde of Mailly & other knyghtes
of this countrey ſette their ymaginacions / 
howe they myght delyuer the coūtrey of theſe
people / and gathered toguyder a fyue hūdred
ſpeares / and had ſpyes / and knewe whan the
Englyſſhe men wolde ryde / and were in purpoſe
to come before Samure / For the capytayns
of all their fortreſſes were aſſembled to
guyder at Prinully / whiche is a lytell here before
vs. The frenchmen rode and paſſed the
water that ye ſe here by vs / and layde thēſelfe
in a buſſhment in a wode / a lytell here beſyde
on our ryght hande. And in the mornynge at
the ſonne riſynge / the Englyſſhe men and other
departed from Prinully / and they were
a nyne hundred men. And whanne oure men
ſawe them / they knewe well they muſt fyght / 
and there they cōmuned toguyder / what crye
they ſhulde call on that daye. Some wolde
haue cryed the crye of ſir Bertrame / but he
wolde in no wyſe agre therto: And more ouer
he ſayd / that he wolde diſplaye no baner that
day / but that he wolde fyght vnder the baner
of ſir Iohan de Beull. Than our ennemyes
came in to this medowe / where as I lyghted
right nowe. and as ſoone as they were entred
we brake out of our buſſhement and entred in
to the medowe. And as ſoone as they ſawe vs
they a lyghted a fote / and we in lykewiſe: and
ſo entred eche within other / the
                  •
                was ſore foynynge
eche agaynſt other / & dyuers of bothe
parties ouerthrowen. Thus our batayle endured
a longe ſpace / without knowyng who
ſhulde haue the vyctorie / but to ſaye ye trouth / 
we were all choſen men of armes / and many
of our ennemyes were but yuell armed / and
were but theues and robbers / Howbeit they
founde vs worke ynoughe / and oure handes
full. But than ſir Moris Creſiquede and ſir
Geffray Richone / ſir Geffray Careſnell and
Morſonaſe / folowed ſir Bertam at the ſpurres.
They came and refreſſhed vs with a threſcore
ſpeares of good men of armes. & they
ruſſhed in with their horſes and brake oure
ennemyes ſo a brode / that they coude nat aſſē
               ble
toguyder agayne. And whanne the capytayus
of theſe pyllers ſawe that the iourney
wente agaynſt them / they tooke their horſes / 
nat all / for there abode in the felde a thre hundred
ſlayne and taken: and the chaſe endured
to ſaynt Mors on the ryuer of Loyre / & there
they entred in to a baſtell. ſir Robert Sem / 
Robert Herne / Richarde Gylle / and Iacomyne
Clerke. Theſe foure ſaued them ſelfe
and paſſed ouer the ryuer of Loyre / and ſo entred
in to foure fortreſſes / that their men helde
on that ſyde the ryuer / but they taryed nat
longe there / but rode in to Auuergne and Lymoſyn.
            
               THus by this iourney / all the coūtre
here aboute was delyuered / for the
robbers nor they aſſembled nomore
toguyder after. Therfore I ſaye / that

                Bertram
the conſtable was a valyaunt man / and
profitable for the realme of Fraunce. ſir quod
I it is trewe / he was a valyaunt man / and ſo
is ſir Olyuer of Cleſquyn. and whan I named
hym Cleſquyn the knight ſmyled / And
I demaunded of hym where at he ſmyled. ſir
quod he I ſhall ſhewe you / bycauſe ye name
hym Cleſquyn / for that is nat his right name
nor neuer was / thoughe euery man call hym
ſo / yet all we of Bretayne call hym the ſame.
And 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Bertram while he lyued wolde gladly
haue hadde it refourmed / but he coude nat amende
it / for the worde is redyer to falle on a
mannes tonge / than his right name. Than
I deſyred hym of his courteſy / to ſhewe me if
there were any great difference bytwene his

names. Nay ſir quod he there is no great difference / 
but where he is called Cleſquyn / he
ſhulde be named Glaye aquyne. And I ſhall
ſhewe you as I haue herde it reported / howe
that name came to hym / and it is of trouthe / 
For ye ſhall fynde it written in the auncyent
cronycles of Bretaygne. The wordes of this
knight greatly pleaſed me / and I ſaid to hym
Sir / ye ſhall do me great pleaſure / to ſhewe
me the mater / and I ſhall neuer forgete it / for
ſir Bertram was ſo valyaunt a knyght / that
his dedes ought to be put in remembraunce.
That is true ꝙ the knyght / and I ſhall ſhewe
you. Thus ſir Wyllyam of Aunſiens began
his tale.
            In the ſeaſon whan Charles the great raigned
in Fraunce / who conquered and augmē
               ted
the faythe / and was Emperour of Rome
and kyng of Fraunce and of Almaygne / and
lyeth at Ayes the chapell. This kynge Charles / 
as we rede and fynde in the auncyent crony
cles / For ye knowe well that all the knowlege
in the worlde is knowen by writyng / for
we haue nothyng to ſounde vpon trouthe nor
to aproue it but by ſcripture. this kyng Charles
was in Spayne diuers tymes / and at one
tyme he was ſtyll there a .ix. yere / without retournyng
in to Fraunce / but ſtyll went forthe
on his conqueſt. In the ſame ſeaſon the
                  •
                was
a kyng ſarazyn called Aquyn / he was kyng of
Bougie in Barbary / right ouer agaynſt ſpaigne / 
for Spaygne is a great countrey / begynnyng
at ſaynt Iohn̄s Pie du porte / for the realme
of Arragon and Nauer / of Biſquay / of
Portugale / of Cōnymbres / of Lixbone / of Ciuyle / 
of Tollet / of Cordwayne / and of Lyon.
All theſe be incloſed within Spayne / & other.
And this great kyng Charlemayne / cōquerid
all theſe countreis. And in this ſeaſon that the
kyng taryed there ſo longe / this kyng Aquyn
of Bougy in Barbary / aſſembled his mē and
came by ſee in to Bretaygne / and arryued at
the porte of Wannes / and he hadde there with
hym his wyfe and chyldren / and there he conquered
and went forwarde. Kynge Charles
was well enfourmed of this viage / and howe
kynge Aquyn proſpered in Bretayne / but for
all that he wolde nat breke his vyage / & ſayd.
Lette hym alone in Bretaygne / it ſhalbe but
a ſmall mater to delyuer the countrey of hym
and of his. Whan we haue ones 
                  •
               ubdued his
countrey here / and brought it in to the holy
faythe. This kynge Aquyn buylded a towre
by the See ſyde: nat farre of fro Wannes / a
goodly and a fayre towre / and it was called
Glaye / And there this kynge Aquyn lay moche.
And whan kyng Charles had accompliſſhed
his vyage / and acquyted all Galyce and
Spaygne from all the myſcreantes / and the
kynges Sarazyns deed and ſlayne / and all
the lande tourned to the Chriſten faythe. than
he retourned in to Bretaygne / and on a daye
hadde a great batayle agaynſt this kynge Aquyne / 
and nyghe all the myſcreantes ſlayne.
And ſo this kynge Aquyne fledde in to the caſtell
of Glaye / and there he hadde redy at the
foote of the towre a ſhyppe / and therin he entred / 
and his wyfe and his chyldren. But he
and his wyfe made ſuche haſte he was ſo nere
chaſed / that they hadde no leyſar to take with
them a yong ſonne that laye and ſlepte in the
towre / of a yere olde. Thus the kynge and
his wyfe departed by the ſee / and this chylde
was founde in the towre of Glaye / and was
brought to kynge Charlemaygne / who was
right ioyouſe of hym and ſaid / howe ye chylde
ſhulde be baptyſed / and ſo he was: and Rouland
& Olyuer helde hym ouer the fonte / and
was named Olyuer. And the kyng gaue him
all the landes that his father Aquyn had conquered.
This chylde whan he came to the age
of a man was a good knight / and his men called
hym ſir Olyuer de Glaye aquyn / bycauſe
he was founde in the towre of Glaye / & ſome
to the kynge Aquyn.
            Thus I haue ſhewed you the firſte fouudacyon
of ſir Bertram of Cleſquyn / who ſhulde
be called Glaye aquyne. And ſir Bertram
in his dayes / after the puttynge out of kynge
Dōpeter of Caſtyle / and had crowned kyng
Henry / ſayde howe he wolde go in to Bougy
to demaūde his herytage / And without fayle
ſo he had done / for kyng Henry had lent hym
men and ſhyppes to go in to Bougye with a
great armye / if a great lette had nat broken
his voyage. And that was whan̄e the prince
of Wales made warre vpon the ſayde kynge
Henry / and dyde put hym downe / and by puiſſaunce
dyde ſette in to Caſtyle agayne Dō
               peter.
And than at the batayle of Marres ſir
Bertram was taken priſonner by ſir Iohan
Chandos / and was ſette to raunſome at a hū
               dred

thouſande frankes. And at another tyme
he was alſo taken at the batayle of Alroy / and
raunſomed agayne / at a hundred thouſande
Frankes. So thus ſir Bertrams purpoſe
was brokenne / for the warres bytwene Englande
and Fraunce was renewed / So that
they hadde ynoughe to do. Thus he was lynially
diſcended fro the kynge of Bougy named
Aquyne / whoſe kyngdome is in Barbarye.
Thus I haue ſhewed you the ryght diſcente
of ſir Bertram of Cleſquyn / I thanked
hym / and ſo we came to the towne of Prinulley.

Or elles as long as I had ben with ſir Iohn̄
Ferant Pertelette of Portyngale. He wolde
haue ſhewed me many thyngꝭ / but it was nat

was right to Towres in Towrayne / whether

on the informacyon of this knyght I toke my

               yE haue herde here be fore / howe theſe
ambaſſadours departed fro Parys / 
fro the kyng and his counſaye / well in
ſtructed what they ſhulde ſaye and do: and ſo
long they rode by their iourneys / that they aryued
at Nauntes. Than they demaunded
where the duke was / it was ſhewed thē howe
he was about the marcheſſe of wānes / whe
                  •
               
as moſt accuſtomably he lay. They rode thyder / 
and ſo came to the cytie of Wannes / it is
but .xx. myles bytwene. The duke was in the
caſtell called le Mote: than they came before
the duke / who by ſemblant made to thē good
and ſwete recule. The byſſhoppe of Langers
bycauſe he was a prelate / began to ſpeke and
to make his prepoſicyon well and ſagely / and
ſayde. Sir duke / we are here ſente to you fro
the kynge our maiſter and fro his vncles / the
duke of Berrey and of Burgoyne / to ſhewe
vnto you / howe they haue great marueyle / in
that the voiage that they wolde haue made in
to Englande is by your meanes broken / and
haue taken and raunſomed the Conſtable of
Fraunce / at ſo highe a raūſome / that they are
ryght ſorie therof. And moreouer ye wyll haue
thre of his caſtelles in Bretaygne / the whiche
ſhalbe a great anoyaūce to all the reſydue
of the coūtre / if they ſhuloe be holde agaynſt
them / with the ayde of the towne of Iugone / 
the whiche is pertaynynge to the Conſtables
herytage. Therfore we are charged to ſhewe
you / and we ſaye vnto you as meſſangers fro
the kynge our mayſter / and from his vncles / 
that ye rendre agayne to the cōſtable of Fraū
               ce
his herytage / that ye with holde from hym / 
and ſette hym agayne in peaſable poſſeſſyon / 
accordyng vnto ryght / in lyke maner as they
were before / whan they were delyuered you
perforce / and by none other ryght nor tytell / 
that ye haue to them. And alſo / that ye reſtore
agayne entierlye / all the money that ye haue
hadde of hym. And this is the commaundement
of the kynge and his counſayle / that ye
come ꝑſonally to Parys / or where as it ſhall
pleaſe the kyng to aſſygne you / there to make
your excuſe. And we repute hym ſo benygne
and pacyent / with that ye be of the blode royall / 
that he wyll here your excuſe: And if he be
nat reaſonable / the duke of Berrey and the
duke of Burgoyne wyll ſo temper hym / that
ye ſhalbe frendes and coſyn to the kynge / as
by reaſon ye ought to be. Than the byſſhopp̄
               
tourned hym to ſir Iohan of Beull and ſaid.
Sir / is nat this the kynges pleaſure? and he
ſayde yes / and ſo dyde ſir Iohan de Vyen.
At theſe wordes there were no mo preſent but
they foure.
            
               WHan the duke of Bretaine had herde
the byſſhoppe of Langers ſpeke / he
ſtudyed a lytell and good cauſe why
for it was a great matter / and at the laſte he
ſayde. Sirs / I haue well vnderſtande your
wordes / and it is good reaſone that I ſo do / 
bycauſe ye be ſent from the kyng and his vncles.
Wherfore in their behalfe I wyll do you
all the honour and reuerence that I can do / I
am bounde therto / but your demaūde and requeſt
requyreth counſayle. Wherfore I ſhall
take counſayle with myne / and make you ſuche
anſwere / that ye ſhall be contented. Sir / 
ye ſaye well quod they / it ſuffyceth vs. Than
they departed and wente to their lodgynges.
At nyght they were deſyred to dyne the nexte
daye with the duke. So the nexte daye they
came to the duke and were well receyued / and
ſo waſſhed and went to dyner & ſatte downe.
Firſte the byſſhoppe of Langers bycauſe he
was a prelate / and than the duke / than the admyrall
of Fraunce / and thanne ſir Iohan de
Beulle: They hadde a great dyner and were
well ſerued / and after dyner they entred in to
a counſayle chambre / and there they talked of
dyuers maters / and herde mynſtrelſy.
            Theſe lordes of Fraunce thought ſurely to
haue hadde an anſwere / but they hadde none:
Than wyne and ſpyces were brought in / and
ſo made collaſyon / and than toke their leaue
and departed to their lodgynge. The nexte
daye they were apoynted to come to the duke / 
and ſo they dyde / and the duke receyued them
ſwetely and at the laſte ſayd. Sirr / I knowe
well ye looke to be aunſwered / for by the wordes
that I haue herde you ſaye / ye are charged
by the kyng and his vncles to bring them
an anſwere. Wherfore I ſay to you / yt I haue
done nothynge to ſir Olyuer of Cleſquyne / 
wherof I ſhulde repente me / ſauynge of one
thynge / and that is / That he hadde ſo good a
markette / as to eſcape a lyue. And in that I
ſaued his lyfe / was for the loue of his offyce / 
and nat for his perſone / For he hath done me
ſoo many diſpleaſures / that I ought to hate
hym deedly. And ſauynge the diſpleaſure of
the kyng and of his vncles / and his coūſayle.
For all the takynge of ſir Olyuer / I haue nat
therby broken their voyage by the ſee. I wyll
well excuſe my ſelfe therin / for I thought non
yuell the daye that I toke hym / a man ought
to take his ennemy wherſoeuer he fynde hym
And if he were deed / I wolde thynke the Realme
of Fraunce to be as well ruled or better / 
than it is by his counſayle. And as for his caſtelles
that I holde / the whiche he hath delyuered
me / I am in poſſeſſyon of them / and ſo
wyll be / withoute the puyſſaunce of a kynge
take them fro me. And as for rendringe of his
money / I aunſwere / I haue had ſo moche to
do in tyme paſte / by the meanes of this ſir Olyuer
of Clyſquyn / that I ranne in dette gretlye
therby: and nowe I haue payde them that
I was bounde vnto / by reaſon of this dette.
This was the anſwere that the duke of Bretaygne
made to the kynges ambaſſadours / 
Than they layde forthe other reaſons / to enduce
the duke to ſome reaſonable waye / but
all his anſweres tourned euer to one concluſyon.
And whan they ſawe none other waye / 
they toke their leaues to departe / and ye duke
gaue them leaue. Than̄e they retourned and
dyd ſo moch by their iourneys that they came
to Parys / to the houſe of Beautie / beſyde
Wynſentes. There was the kyng & the quene
and thyder came the duke of Berrey and the
duke of Bourgoyne / hauyng great deſyre to
knowe what anſwere the duke of Bretaygne
haddemade.
            
               THe aunſwere ye haue herde here before / 
I nede nat to ſhewe it agayne / 
but the kyng and his counſayle were
nat content with the duke of Bretaygne / that
his ambaſſadours hadde made no better exployte:
and they ſayde / howe the duke was a
proude man and a preſumptuous / and that
the mater ſhulde nat ſo reſte in peace / ſeynge
the matter ſo preiudyciall for the Crowne of
Fraunce. And the entenſyon of the kyng and
his counſayle was / to make warre agaynſte
the duke of Bretayne / and the duke loked for
nothynge elles / For he ſawe and knewe well / 
howe he had greatly diſpleaſed the kyng and
his counſell / but he hated ſo mortally the conſtable / 
that it toke fro hym the good order of
reaſon / for he repented hym ſore / that he had
nat putte hym to dethe / whan he hadde hym

in his daunger. Thus the mater contynued
a longe ſeaſon / and the duke of Bretayne laye
at Wannes / and lytell and lytell rode ouer his
countrey / for he freared greatly embuſſhmentes.
He kepte ſtyll in loue and fauour his cyties
and good townes / and made ſecrete treaties
with the Englyſſhmen / and made his caſtelles
and fortereſſes to be as well kepte / as
thoughe he had had opyn warre / and was in
many imaginacions on the dede he had done
Somtyme he wolde ſay / he wolde he had nat
taken the conſtable / howe be it he ſayd euer to
ſtoppe mennes mouthes / that ſir Olyuer of
Cleſquyn had ſore diſhleaſed hym / ſo that many
a man ſayd / that elles he wolde neuer haue
done it / therby he brought his coūtre in feare / 
for it is but a ſmall ſignorie / if a prince be nat
feared and douted of his menne / for and the
worſte fall / he maye haue peace whan he lyſt.
¶Nowe lette vs leaue to ſpeke of the duke of
Bretaygne / and let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of the
buſyneſſe that was in the realme of Englāde / 
whiche was in the ſame ſeaſon / horryble and
marueylous.

               YE haue herde here before / 
howe the kyng of Englandes vncles / 
the duke of yorke & the duke
of Glouceſtre / with therle of Saliſbury
and the erle of Arundell / 
the erle of Northumberlande / the erle of Notyngham / 
and the archebyſſhoppe of Caūterbury.
All theſe were of one alyaunce and accorde / 
agaynſt the kynge and his counſayle / 
for theſe lordes and other / were nat content wt
the kynges counſayle / and ſayd among them
ſelfe. This duke of Irelande dothe with the
kynge what he lyſte / and with all the realme.
The kyng wyll nat be counſayled but by vnhappy
men / and of baſe lynage / and taketh no
regarde to the great lordes of his realme. As
longe as he hath ſuche counſayle about hym / 
the buſyneſſe of Englande can nat do well for
a realme can nat be well gouerned / nor a kynge
well counſayled / by ſuche vngracious people.
It is ſene a poore man moūted in to gret

tymes corrupteth & diſtroyeth the people and

knowe what parteyneth to honoure / their deſyre
is euer to enryche and to haue all thēſelfe / 
lyke an Otter in the water / whiche coueteth
to haue all that he fyndeth. Who hath any profyte
by that the duke of Irelande is ſo great
with the kyng? we knowe full well fro whenſe
he came / yet we ſe that all the realme is ruled
by hym and nat by the kynges vncles / nor by
none of his blode. This ought nat to be ſuffred.
We knowe well ynoughe / that the Erle
of Oxenforde had neuer ye grace to do any valyaunt
dede in this realme: his honour / wyſedome / 
counſayle or gentylneſſe / is ryght well
knowen / and that was well knowen ones by

demaūded what mater was that / I ſhall

were many lordes of Englande with hym. &
whan the prince had dronke / bicauſe ſir Iohn̄
Chandos was conſtable of Acquitayne / the
prince ſente hym his cuppe firſt to drinke / and
he toke the cuppe and dranke / and made therof
none offre firſte to the Erle of Oxenforde / 
who was father to this duke of Irelāde: and
after that ſir Iohan Chandos had dronke / a
ſquyer bare the cuppe to the Erle / who hadde
ſuche diſpyte that ſir Iohan Chandos hadde
drōke before hym / that he refuſed the cuppe / &
wolde nat drinke / and ſayde to the ſquyer in
maner of a mocke. Go to thy mayſter Chandos / 
and bydde hym drinke. Shall I go ſaid
the ſquyer / he hath dronke all redy? Therfore
drinke you ſythe he hath offred it to you / if ye
wyll nat drinke / by ſaynt George I ſhall caſt
the drinke in your face. Therle whan he herd
that / douted that the Squyer wolde do as he
ſayde / and ſo toke the cuppe / and ſette it to his
mouthe and dranke / or at leeſt made ſemblant
to drinke. And ſir Iohan Chandos who was

nat farre thens / ſawe well all the mater and
helde hym ſtyll tyll the prince was gone from
them: Than he came to the Erle and ſayde.
Sir Aubery are ye diſpleaſed / in that I dranke
before you? I am Conſtable of this countrey / 
I maye well drinke before you / ſythe my
lorde the Prince and other lordes here / are cō

knoweth nat ſo well as I what ye dyd the

ſayde to you at your cōmynge I knowe right

you if ye hadde furnyſſhed your voyage / and
what ye had done with his ſonne the Prince.
ye aunſwered / howe ye had lefte hym in good

What and howe durſte ye be ſo bolde / to retourne
without hym. I commaūded you and
all other whan ye departed / that ye ſhulde nat
retourne without hym / on payne of all that
ye myght forfayte. And you this to retourne / 
I ſtraitly commaunde you / that within four

feared the kynges wordes / as it was reaſon / 
and ſo auoyded the realme / and ſo your aduē

erle of Orenforde was a ſhamed / and wolde
gladlye he hadde ben thens at that tyme / but
he was fayne to ſuffre and to here thoſe wordes.
This ſir Iohan Chandos ſayde to hym
in opyn preſence. Therfore it is nat to be marueyled / 
thoughe this duke of Irelande / who
is ſonne to the ſayd erle of Oxenforde / be diſdaynfull /

For he taketh vpon hym to rule all Englande
aboue the kynges vncles. Well quod

wyll haue it ſo.
            
               THus the people in the Realme murmured
in dyuers places / agaynſt the

thyng that greatly abated his honour / & that
was / he had firſte to his wyfe the doughter of
the lorde of Coucy / the lady Iſabell / who was
a fayre Lady and a good / and of more noble
blode than he is of. But he fell in loue with another
damoſell of the quenes of Englande
an Almaygne borne / and dyde ſo moche with
pope Vrbayne at Rome / that he was deuorſed
fro the doughter of the lorde Coucy / without
any tytell of reaſon / but by preſumpcion / 
and for his ſynguler appetyte / and than wedded
the quenes mayde / and kynge Rycharde
conſēted there to. he was ſo blynded with this
duke of Irelande that if he had ſayd. ſir / this

nat haue ſayd the contrarye. This dukes mother
was greatly diſpleaſed with him for that
dede / and toke in to her cōpany his firſt wyfe
the lady of Coucy. The duke dyde yuell / and
therfore at length yuell came to hym. and this
was the firſt princypall cauſe that he was behated
for in Englande / euery thyng that turneth
to yuell / muſt haue a begynning of yuell.
This duke of Irelande truſted ſo moche in
the grace and fauour of the kyng / that he beleued / 
that no man ſhulde trouble hym. And it

The commons ſayd / that if they wolde make

to you / and all the people ingenerall requireth
you to take vpon / you the gouernynge of the

ſo that the realme hath ben more greued with
tayles and other ſubſydies / nat accuſtomed / 
ſythe the kynges Coronacyon / than in fyftie
yere before / and it is nat knowen where the richeſſe
is become. Wherfore ſir / maye it pleaſe
you to prouyde ſome remedy / or elles the mater
wyll go yuell / for the commons cryeth out
theron. Than the duke anſwered and ſayde / 
fayre ſirs I haue herde you well ſpeke / but I
alone can nat remedy this mater / howe be it I
ſe well ye haue cauſe to cōplayne / and ſo hathe
all other people. But though I be vncle to the
kynge and ſonne to a kyng: though I ſhulde
ſpeke therof / yet nothynge ſhalbe done for all
that / For the kyng my nephue hath ſuche coū
               ſayle
as nowe about hym / whome he beleueth
better than hym ſelfe / whiche coūſayle ledeth
hym as they lyſte. But if ye wyll come to the

cyties and good townes of Englande. And
alſo ſome prelates and noble ꝑſonages of the

And than ye maye ſaye to the kynge. Ryght

ye haue ben counſayled / as yet hyther vnto / 
Nor ye haue nat takenne good regarde to
the buſyneſſe of this your Realme / by reaſon
of the poore and yonge counſayle that ye haue

as ye haue ſene and knowen ryght well.
For if God haddenat ſhewed his grace / this
realme had been loſte and diſtroyed. Therfore
ſir / here in the prenſens of your vncles / 
we requyre youre grace / as humble ſubiectes
ought to deſyre their prince / that your grace

in ſproſperyte and honour / and your people
that complayneth / to be kepte and maynteyned
in their ryght / the whiche to do / your

And that it maye pleaſe you to call togyther
the thre eſtates of your Realme / prelates
and barownes / and wyſemen of your cyties
and good townes. and that they may regarde
if the gouernyng of your realme that is paſt / 
be well or nat. And ſir / if they parceyue that

Saye to hym boldely / that the Realme wyll

Than come & bringe your requeſtes and

nat that we wyll be rewled by our cōmon people / 
that ſhall neuer be ſene / as for our gouernynge
nor in the gouernaunce of them yt rule
vnder vs / we ſe nothynge but right & iuſtyce.
Than a ſeuyn of them all with one voyce anſwered
and ſayde. Right redouted ſouerayne
ſayng your gracyous diſpleaſure / as for iuſtyce
in your realme is right feble / your grace
knoweth nat all / nor canne nat knowe. your
grace nouther demaundeth for it nor enquereth
therfore / and ſuche as be of your coūſayle
forbere to ſhewe it you / bycauſe of their owne
profyte. For ſir / it is no iuſtyce to cutte of heedes / 
handes / and fete / ſuche maner of punyſſhmentes
be nat laudable. But ſir / good iuſtice
is to kepe your people in ryght / and to ſette ſuche
wayes and order / as they myght lyue in
peace / that they ſhulde haue none occaſyon to
grudge or to make any commoſyon. And ſir / 
we ſaye that ye ſette vs to longe a daye / as to
Mighelmas. ſir / we may be neuer ſo well eaſed
as nowe / Wherfore ſir / we ſaye all by one
aſſente that we wyll haue accompte / and that
ſhortely / of them that hath gouerned your realme / 
ſythe your Coronacyon. And we wyll
knowe Where youre Reuenewes is become / 
with all the taxes / tayles / and ſubſydies this
nyne yeres paſte / and wheron they haue been
beſtowed. If ſuche as are your treaſourers
make a good accompte / or nere thervnto / we
ſhall be ryght ioyouſe / and ſuffre them to gouerne
ſtyll. And if they can nat acquyte them
ſelfe therin trewly / they ſhalbe refourmed by
youre deputyes eſtablyſſhed to that purpoſe / 

as my lordes your vncles & other. With thoſe
wordes the kynge behelde his vncles & helde
his peace / to ſe what they wolde ſaye. Than
ſir Thomas duke of Glouceſter ſayde. Sir / 
in the requeſt and prayer of theſe good people
the commons of your realme / I ſe nothynge
therin but ryght and reaſone. Sir quod the
duke of yorke it is of trouthe / and ſo ſayde all
the other prelates and barons that were there
preſent. Than the duke of Glouceſter ſayde
agayne. Sir / it is but reaſon that ye knowe
where your good is become. The kyng ſawe
well / howe they were all of one accorde / and
ſawe howe this chafe Marmoſettes durſt ſpeke
no worde / for there were to many gret men
agaynſt them. Well quod the kyng I am content.
Lette them be rydde awaye / for ſommer
ſeaſon cometh on and huntynge tyme / whervnto
we wyll nowe entende: Than the kynge
ſayd to the people. Sirs / wolde ye haue this
mater ſhortely diſpatched? yea ſir quod they / 
and that humbly we beſeche your grace. And
alſo we beſeche all my lordes here / and ſpecyally
my lordes your vncles to be there at. We
are content quod they / for the apeyſyng of all
parties / as well for the kynge as for the Realme / 
for oure parte lyeth therin. Than they
ſayde agayne. We deſyre alſo the reuerende
father in god / the archebyſſhoppe of Caunterbury / 
the byſſhoppe of Lyncolne / and the
byſſhoppe of Wyncheſter to be there. They
aunſwered and ſayde / they were content ſo to
be. Than agayn they deſyred all other lordes
to be there / that were there preſent / as the erle
of Saliſbury and the Erle of Northumberlande / 
ſir Reynolde Cobham / ſir Guy Brian
ſir Iohn̄ Felton / ſir Mathewe Gourney. and
moreouer they ſayd / they wolde ordayne that
of euery good cytie and towne in Englande / 
there ſhulde be a thre or four notable perſons / 
and they ſhulde determyne for all the hole cō
               montie
of Englande. Than this mater was
determyned / and to aſſemble the vtas of ſaint
George at Weſtmynſter. And there all ye treaſourers / 
collectours / and offycers of the kynges
to be there / and to make there accomptes
before theſe ſayd lordes. The kyng was content
therwith / and was brought to it by fayreneſſe
and nat byfore / by the deſyre of his vncles
and other lordes: It ſemed to hym behouable / 
to knowe where his treaſoure was become.
Thus amiably euery man deꝑted fro
Wyndſore / and the lordes went to London / &
the treaſourers and other offycers were ſende
for throughout the realme / to come with their
full accomptes on payne of diſhonourynge / &
loſſe of all that they had / and lyfe.

before the counſaile / they denyed the mater / &
layd all the faute in hym. And the duke of Irelande
ſayd to hym priuely bytwene them two.
Sir Symon / I vnderſtande ye ſhalbe arested
and ſette in priſon / and holde there tyll ye
haue payed the ſōme that is demaunded / nothyng
ſhalbe abated. Go your waye whether
ſoeuer they ſende you / I ſhall rightwell make

of Iohan of Bretaygne / ſonne to ſaynt
Charles of Bloys / the whiche ſōme ye knowe
well is owyng to me / I ſhall preſent the counſayle
therwith at this tyme. And fynally the
kyng is our ſoueraigne lorde / he ſhall pardon
and forgyue it you clerely / for ye profet ought
to be his and no mannes els. Syr ꝙ ſir Symon
Burle / if I thought nat that ye ſhulde
helpe agaynſt the kynge / and to beare out my

go in to Almayne / and to the kyng of Beame
for thyder I coulde be welcome: and ſo let the
mater rynne a ſeaſon tyll the worlde be better
apeaſed. Than the duke ſayde. I ſhall neuer
fayle you / we are companyons and all of one
ſect. ye ſhall take day to pay their demaūde / I
knowe well ye maye pay and ye lyſte in redy
money / more than a hundred thouſande frankes
ye nede nat feare the dethe / ye ſhall nat be
brought to that poynte / ye ſhall ſe the mater otherwiſe
chaunge before the feaſt of ſaynt Michell / 
whan I haue the kyng ones at my wyll / 
wherof I ame ſure. For all that he dothe now
at this tyme is by force and agaynſt his wyll.
We muſte apeaſe theſe curſed londoners / and

               SIr Symon Burle had a lytell
truſte on the wordes of the duke
of Irelande / and ſo came before
the lordes of Englande dukes / 
erles / barons / and counſayle of
the good townes. Than it was ſayde to hym.
Sir Symon / ye haue alwayes ben a notable
knight in the realme of Englāde / and ye were
well beloued with my lorde the prince. And ye
and the duke of Irelande haue had in a maner
the gouernynge of the kyng. We haue ſene
all your maters and well examyned them / the
whiche be nother good nor faire / which gretly
diſpleaſeth vs / for your owne ſake. It is clerely
determynyd by the hole generall counſayle
that ye muſt go to priſon / in to ye towre of London / 
& there to remayne tyll ye haue brought
into this chambre the money of the kynges / 
and of the realmes that ye haue gathered. the
whiche as it apereth by the treaſourers rolles
draweth to the ſome of two hundred and fyfty
thouſande frankes. Nowe loke what ye wyll
ſay. Than ſyr Symon was halfe diſcomforted
and ſaid. Sirs I ſhall with a good wyll / 
And alſo it behoueth me ſo to do / to fulfyll yo
                  •

me haue a clerke aſſigned to me / that he maye
write all ſuche expenſes as I haue layde oute
in tyme paſt / in Almayne & in Beame / in procurynge

                Willyam
Helmon and of ſir Thomas Tryuet / 
for they were nat greatly in ye fauour of ſome
of the barones of Englande / nor of the commontie
of the realme / for the vyage that they
made in to Flaunders / For it was ſayd / that
neuer Englyſſhmen made ſo ſhamefull a vyage.
The byſſhoppe of Norwyche and ſir
Hughe Caurell / that was as than capitayne
of Calais were excuſed. & layde to the others
charge / howe they hadde taken money for the
gyueng vp of Burbourcke and Grauelyng / 
Some ſayd / that that dede was trayſon. they
were ſent for and ſir Wylliam Helmon came / 
but ſir Thomas Tryuer was excuſed I ſhall
ſhewe you howe. ¶The ſame weke that he
was ſente for / beyng in his owne houſe in the
Northe ꝑte / he rode out into the feldes vpon
a yonge horſe that he hadde and ſpurred hym
ſo that the horſe ranne awaye with hym / ouer
buſſhes and hedges / and at laſte fell in a dyke
and brake his necke / and ſo ſir Thomas Triuet
dyed whiche was great dōmage / and his
dethe was greatlye complayned with many
good menne of the realme. yet for all that his
heyres were fayne to paye a certayne ſomme
of Floreyns to the Counſayle to the kynges
behoue / as they ſayde. But the chiefe encytyng
of thoſe maters came by the kynges vncles / 
and by the generall counſayle of the coū
               trey / 
as it appered after in Englande. For of
trouthe / thoughe the duke of Glouceſtre was
the yongeſt brother in age / yet he was mooſt
auncyent in the buſyneſſe of the realme / for he
drewe to that opinyon that mooſt of the noble
menne / and prelates and the commons helde.
Whan that ſir Them̄s Tryuettes cōpoſicion

was made after his dethe / by the maner as ye
haue herde here before / therby the penaūce of
ſir Wylliam Helmon was greatly aſſwaged.
He entred with the counſayle / and by the meanes
of the valyantneſſe of his body / and the
good ſeruyce that he had done dyuers tymes
for Englande / as well in Bourdeloyes as in
Guyen and in Picardye / where he was alwayes
proued a good knight. There was nothynge
layde to his reproche / but takynge of
the money / for the delyueraūce of Burborcke
and Grauelynge. Than he excuſed hymſelfe
with fayre and ſwete wordes / and made dyuers
reaſonable reaſons / & ſayd. My lordes / 
who ſo euer were in lyke caſe as we were in yt
tyme in the garyſon of Bourburke / I thynke
wolde do as we dyd. I haue herde ſir Iohn̄
Chandos and ſir Gaultier of Manny ſay dyuers
tymes / who were right wyſe and of gret
valure. Howe that a man ought of two or iii.
wayes choſe the beſt waye / and wherby moſt
to endomage his enemyes. And thus ſir Thomas
Tryuet and I / beyng in the garyſons of
Bourburke and Grauelyng / and ſawe howe
we were encloſed on all parties / and no conforte
aperyng to vs from any parte. And parceyued
well / howe we coulde nat endure many
aſſautes / for they that laye about vs / were
as choſen men of armes / as euer I ſawe / or I
trowe any other Englyſſhemenne. For as I
knewe iuſtely by the reporte of our harraude / 
they were at leeſt / a ſyxtene thouſande men of
armes / knyghtes and ſquyers / and a .xl. thouſande
of other. And we were nat paſte a thre
hundred ſpeares and as many archers. And
alſo our garyſone was of ſuche cyrcuyte / that
we coude nat entēde on euery place. And that
we well ꝑceyued by an aſſaut that was made
vs on a daye / For whyle we were at oure defence
on the one parte / they caſte in fyre on the
other parte / wherby we were gretly abaſſhed
and that our ennemyes right well parceyued.
And therfore to ſaye the trouthe / the Frenche
kyng and his counſaile wrought by great gē
               tylneſſe / 
ſeyng ye caſe that we were in / to gyue
vs trewſe. For if they had gyuen vs another
aſſaute the nexte daye / as they were ordayned
to do / I thynke they hadde taken vs at their
pleaſure. yet for all this / they courteſly treated
with vs / by the meanes of the duke of Bretayne / 
who tooke great payne in that mater.
And where as we ſhulde haue gyuen theym
money for our raunſommes / if we hadde ben
taken / as it was lykely / they gaue vs money / 
wherby we dyde them dommage / and it was
in them to haue endomaged vs. We thought
we conquered greatly on them whan we had
of their money / and departed oure ſelfe ſafe
and withoute trouble / and hadde with vs all
that we had won in all the warre tyme / on the
fronters of Flaūders. And my lordes beſyde
that / to pourge me of all blame / if there be any
ꝑſone in Englande or without / knight or Eſquyer / 
Except the ꝑſons of my lordes the dukes
of Lācaſtre / yorke / & Gloceſter / that wyll
ſaye and abyde therby / that I haue done any
vntrouthe to the kynge my naturall lorde / or
accuſe me of any trayſon. I am here redye to
receyue his gauge / and to putte my body in
aduenture by dedes of armes to proue the cō
               trarye / 
as the Iudge therto aſſigned ſhall ordayne.
Theſe wordes and ſuche other / and
the valyauntneſſe of the knighte excuſed hym
greatlye / and ſaued hym frome the parell of
dethe: And afterwarde he retourned agayne
in to his fourmer eſtate / and was after that a
ryght valyaunt knyght / and auaunſed in to
the kynges Counſayle. But as at that tyme / 
ſir Symon Burle was nat delyuered out of
priſone / for the kynges vncles hated hym gretlye /

this duke of Irelande was ſo great with the
kyng that he ruled hym as he lyſte. He and ſir
ſymon Burle / were two of the princypall coū
               ſaylours
that the kynge had: for they hadde a
longe ſeaſon gouerned the kynge and the realme.
And they were had in ſuſpecte that they
hadde gadered richeſſe without nombre / and
the renoume ranne in dyuers places / that the
duke of Irelande and ſir Symon Burle had
a long ſeaſon gathered toguyder money and
ſente it in to Almayne: For it was come to the
knowledge of the kynges vncles / and to the
counſaylours of the good cyties and townes
of Englande / that helde of their partie / howe
they had ſente out of the caſtell of Douer by

cofers and cheſtes full of money. They ſayd
it was falſely and felonouſly done / to aſſemble
the rycheſſe of the realme / and to ſende it
in to other ſtraūge coūtreys / wherby the realme
was greatly impoueryſſhed / and ye people
were ſoroufull and ſayde / that golde and

were as deed and loſte / and they coulde
nat ymagin how it was / but by this meanes.

And alſo the archbyſſhoppe of Caunterbury
ſayd / that in the ſeaſon whan the frēche kyng
ſhulde haue come with his armye in to Englande / 
this ſir Symon Burle gaue counſayle
that the ſhrine of ſaynt Thom̄s of Caū
               terburye
ſhulde haue been taken downe and
brought in to Douer caſtell. And the noyſe
was that he wolde haue had it ſo / to thentent
that if he had ben in any dāger / to haue taken
and ſtollen it / and conueyed it out of Englād
Theſe maters were ſo layde to his charge / yt
none excuſe coulde be herde / but on a daye he
was brought out of the towre and beheeded
lyke a traytour / god haue mercy on his ſoule.
To write of his ſhamefull dethe / ryght ſore
diſpleaſeth me / howe be it I muſt nedes do it
to folowe the hyſtorie. Greatly I complayne
his dethe / for whan̄e I was yonge I founde
hym a gentyll knyght / ſage and wyſe / but by
this enfortune he dyed.
            HIs nephewe and heyre ſir Richarde
Burle / was with the duke of Lancaſtre
in Galyce the ſameſeaſon that
this caſe fell in Englande / and one of ye moſt
renoumed in all his hooſt / nexte the Conſtable / 
for he was as ſouerayne Marſhall of all
the hooſt / and was chiefe of coūſayle with the
duke ye may well beleue that whan he knewe
of the dethe of his vncle / he was ſore diſpleaſed:
And alſo this gētyll knight ſir Richarde
Burle dyed in the ſame iourney on his bedde
by reaſon of ſickeneſſe / as many other dyde:
as ye ſhall here after / at place and tyme conuenyent.
Whan kynge Rycharde knewe of the
dethe of this knyght / as he was in the marcheſſe
of Wales / he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and
ſware / howe the mater ſhulde nat paſſe / ſithe
they had ſo put to dethe his knyght / without
good reaſon or tytell of right. The quene alſo
was ſorie and wepte for his dethe / bycauſe
he fetched her oute of Almaygne. Suche as
were of the kynges coūſayle douted greatly / 
as the duke of Irelande / ſir Nicholas Brā
               ble / 
ſir Thomas Tryuilyen / ſir Iohn̄ Beauchampe / 
ſir Iohan Saliſbury / and ſir Mychaell
de la Poule. Alſo the kyngꝭ vncles had
put out of offyce the archebyſſhoppe yf yorke
named Wylliam Neuell / brother germayne
to the lorde Neuell of Northūberlande / whiche
byſſhoppe had longe ben treaſourer of all
Englande. And the duke of Glouceſtre had
charged hym to medell no more with the buſyneſſe
of the realme / on payne of his lyfe / but
that he ſhulde go to yorke or therabout / whe
                  •
               
it pleaſed hym in his benifyce / and dwell ther
and medell no further. And alſo it was ſhewed
hym / howe the honoure of his lynage / &
in that he was a preeſt / excuſed hym of many
great maters / ſore preiudiciall to his honour
And alſo it was ſhewed hym / that the mooſt
parte of the counſayle of the cōmontie wolde
haue had him diſgrated and putte to dethe / in
lyke maner as ſir Symon Burle was.
            So he departed fro London and wente in to
the Northe to dwell on his benifyce. with this
he & all his lynage were ſore dyſpleaſed / and

thought ſurely that the erle of Northombrelande
had brought that mater to paſſe / for all
that he was of his lygnage / and were neyghbours.
In to his rome was choſen a right valyant / 
a wyſe / & a ſage clerke / ye archebyſſhop
of Caunterbury / who was gretely in the fauour
of the kynges vncles. He was come of
the Mountague and Salyſburies / and was
vncle to the erle of Salyſbury. there was made
of the kynges counſayle by the aduyſe of
all the comons / therle of Salyſbury / the erle

Notyngham / ye byſſhop of Norwyche called
ſir Henry Spenſer. the byſſhop of Wyncheſtre
chauncellour of Englande abode ſtyll in
his offyce / and was with the kynges vncles.
the moſt renomed man in ye counſayle nexte ye
duke of Gloceſte was ſyr Thomas Mountague
archbiſſhop of Caūterbury / and well he
was worthy / for he was a dyſcrete prelate / &
toke grete payne to reforme the royalme and
to brynge it in to the ryght waye / and that the
kynge ſhulde put from hym the marmoſettes
that troubled all the royalme. often tymes he
wolde ſpeke with the duke of yorke in yt matter / 
& the duke wolde ſaye to hym / ſyr byſſhop

            ¶Howe the counſayle drewe togyder
for the reformacyon of the kynge
and of the realme / and howe by the
counſayle of the duke of Irelande the
kynge was of the accorde too make
warre agaynſt his vncles / & agaynſt
the cytees and townes. Ca. xcv.
            
               IN lyke maner as the
kinges vncles and ye newe
counſayle of Englande beynge
at London / deuyſed
of the buſyneſſe of Englā
               de
to reforme it / & to bring
it into good eſtate. So on
the other ſyde / the duke of Irelande and his
counſayle ymagined nyght and daye / howe
they myght contynue in their eſtates / and to
condēpne the kynges vncles / as ye ſhall hereafter.
Whanne kyng Richarde was come to
Briſtowe & the / quene with hym: they kepte
them ſelfe in the Caſtell there / and men that
were farre of / beleued that ye kyng laye there
for ſauour of the duke of Irelande / who ſaid
that he wolde go in to Irelande / and it was
ſayd / that the kyng wolde ſe hym diſpatched
It was agreed by the generall coūſaile / that
if he wolde go in to Irelande / he ſhulde haue
at the coſte of the realme fyue hūdred men
of armes / and fyftene hundred archers / and
that he ſhulde abide there thre yere / and to be
well and trewly payde / Howe be it the duke
had no great wyll to make that vyage / for he
ſawe well the kyng was yonge / and as than
he myght rule as he lyſt. Therfore he feared
if he ſhulde go farre of / that the loue and the
fauour that he was in with the kynge ſhulde
aſſwage. Alſo beſyde that / he was in ſuche
loue with one of the quenes damoſelles / called
Lancegrone / yt in no wyſe he coude leaue
the ſyght of her. She was a fayre and a pleaſaunt
vamoſell / and was come with ye quene
out of the realme of Beame. This duke loued
her ſo entierlye / that he wolde gladly be
deuorſed fro his owne wife / who was doughter
to the lorde of Coucy / and dyde ſende for
that entente to Rome to pope Vrbayne. All
the good people of the realme had marueyle
therof / and diſpreyſed hym greatly / for that
the good lady was dought̄ / to the doughter
of good kyng Edwarde / & of ye good quene
Philyppe. The duke of yorke and the duke
of Glouceſtre toke that dede in great diſpyte
but for all their hate the duke of Irelande ſet
lytell therby / for he was ſo blynded with louynge
of this damoſell / that he promyſed to
be deuorſed / and to mary her. He douted nat
the popes graunt / ſo that he myght gette the
kynges and the quenes good wyll / for he reputed
his wyfe that he had frēche / & brought

vp in Fraunce / and ſo was her father ye lorde
of Coucy / and he had made warre agaynſt
pope Vrbayne / in the tytell of pope Clemēt / 
wherfore pope Vrbayne loued nat yt blode.
Therfore he ſayde / the pope wolde enclyne
the lyghtlyer to his deuorſe. This mater the
duke dyde putte forthe / and promyſed to Lā
               cegrone
to mary her. This duke had a mother
a wydowe / called the olde counteſſe of
Oxenforde / ſhe agreed nat to the opynion of
her ſonne / but blamed hym greatly of his folye / 
and ſayde: Howe god wolde be ſore diſpleaſed
with hym / and paye hym one day for
all / and than̄e it wolde be to late to repente.
and ſhe toke the ducheſſe to her / and kept her
ſtyll in her eſtate. And ſuche as ought the ladye
any good wyll / gaue her great thankes
therfore.
            
               THus I haue ſhewed you parte
of the buſyneſſe of Englande / 
that fell in this ſeaſon. And yet
I ſhalle procede further / as I
was enfourmed. ye haue herde
howe the duke of Irelande was aboute the
kynge in the marches of Wales / and nyght
and daye ymagyned on none other thynge / 
but howe he myght bringe about his entent.
And ſo ſerued the kynge and the quene with
fayre wordes to pleaſe theym / and cauſed all
other knyghtes and ſquyers there about / to
come to Buſtowe to ſe the kyng and ye quene
and made them great ſporte in huntyng. the
kynge ſuffred hym to do what he lyſte. The
ſame ſeaſon that the kynge laye at Briſtowe
on the ryuer of Syuerne / in the marches of
Wales / The duke of Irelande tooke great
payne to ryde in and out / and ſpecially in to
Wales / and ſayd to ſuche as wolde here hym
gentylmen or other. Howe the kynges vncles / 
to haue the ſoueraygntie of the realme / 
hadde diſmyſſed out of the kynges coūſayle / 
noble / valyaunt and ſage perſonnages / As
the archebyſſhoppe of yorke / the byſſhoppe
of Dyrhame / the byſſhoppe of London / ſir
Mychaell de la Poule / ſir Nicholas Bramble / 
ſir Iohan Saliſbury / ſir Robert Tryuilyen
ſir Iohan Beauchampe / & hym ſelfe / 
and hadde putte to dethe a valyaunt knyght
ſir Symon Burle / So that and they multiplye
in their eſtate / they wyll diſtroye all Englande.
This duke of Irelande dyde ſo moche / 
and preached ſo to the people / and to the
knyghtes and ſquyers of Wales / and of the
countreis there aboute / that the mooſt parte
beleued hym. And on a daye they came ingenerall
to the kynge to Briſtowe / and demaū
               ded
of hym / if that it were his pleaſure / as
the duke of Irelande hadde ſhewed theym.
The kynge aunſwered and ſayd / yea truely.
And prayed and commaunded them / as they
loued hym / to beleue hym / and ſayd he wolde
auowe all that he ſhulde do / affyrmyng how
he thought his vncles were to hygh mynded
ſo that he feared leſte they wolde ſurmounte
hym / and take awaye his realme from hym.
And they of the marches of Wales / alwayes
loued the prince of Wales / father to ye kyng.
For by ye tidynges they herde out of the marches
of London / they thought iuſtely / that
the kyng and the duke of Irelande had good
cauſe: And ſo demaunded of the kynge what
his pleaſure was to do. The kynge aunſwered
and ſayd / howe he wolde gladly that the
lōdoners that hadde done hym ſo great treſpaſſes / 
that they were corrected and brought
to reaſon / & his vncles in lykewiſe. They of
Wales ſayd / they were bounde to obey their
kyng / nor they ought no fayth nor homage to
no man but to hym / for he was their kynge &
ſoueraygne lorde. Wherfore they ſayde / they
were redy to go whyder ſoeuer the kyng dyd
commaunde them. The kynge was well cō
               tente
with that aunſwere / and in lykewiſe ſo
was the duke of Irelande. Whan the Duke
ſawe that the kyng wolde ſhewe that the buſyneſſe
was parteynynge to hym ſelfe / and
that he hadde ſo good deſyre to diſtroye his
aduerſaries / and to bringe theym to reaſon.
He hadde therof great ioye / and ſayde to thē
of his counſayle. We can nat do better than
to retourne to London / and ſhewe our puiſſaunce.
And ſo to do / outher by fayre wordes
or otherwyſe / to bring the Lōdoners to their
accorde / and to be obeyſaunt to the kynges
commaundement. Alwayes they enfourmed
the kynge / howe that it was a great loſſe to
a realme / whan there be many heedes & chefe
gouernours / and howe there coude no good
come therby / and the kynge affyrmed ye ſame
and ſayde / howe he wolde no lenger ſuffre it / 
but that he wolde fynde ſuche remedy / that
other Realmes ſhulde take enſample by his

realme.
            NOwe ſirs. I reporte me if I haue
nat good cauſe to ſaye / ye the
realme of Englande in this ſeaſon / 
was in great paryll and aduenture
to haue ben loſt / without recouery?
For the kynge was moued agaynſt his vncles / 
and agaynſt a great parte of all ye great
lordes of the realme / and they agaynſt hym:
And the cytes and good townes one againſt
another: And the prelates hadde great indignacyon
one agaynſt another / ſo that none
coude remedy it / but alonely god. Whan the
duke of Irelande ſawe that he had the agrement
of the kyng / and of the mooſt ꝑte of thē
of the coūtrey of Wales: than he came to the
kyng & ſayd. ſir / if ye wyll inſtytute & make
me your lieutenaunt / I ſhall take a .xii. or a
fyftene thouſāde men with me / and go to the
marcheſſe of London or to Oxenforde / your
cyte and myne / and there we wyll ſhewe our
puyſſaunce agaynſt theſe Londoners & your
vncles / who haue ſo great indignacyon agaynſt
you. They haue putte to dethe ſome
of your counſayle. And ſir / outher by fayre
wordes or otherwyſe / we ſhall bringe them
to reaſon. The kynge ſayde he was content / 
Sayeng / I wyll and ordayne you / to be the
cheife ſouerayne of my Realme / and to reyſe
vp men where ye can gette theym / and leade
them wheder ye thynke beſt / to augment our
ſygnorie and realme. And to the entent that
euery man ſhall clerely ſe that the hoole Realme
parteyneth to me / I wyll that ye beare
with you my banners and ſtanderdes / and
other abylmetes of warre / ſuche as I wolde
beare my ſelfe in batayle. And I thynke that
if the people ſe my banners diſplayed / they
ſhall take corage and hardyneſſe to ſuſteyne
my quarell. And I wyll ye punyſſhe ſuche
rebelles as wyll nat obey you / in ſuche wyſe / 
as all other maye take enſample by them. I
beleue all ſuche as ſhall ſe my banners waue
in the wynde / ſhall put them ſelfe vnder
them / and ſhalbe afrayde
to diſobey our cōmaū
               dement.
Theſe
wordes
greatly reioyſed the
duke of Irelande.

Therwith this ſir Robert Tryuilyen departed
from Briſtowe diſguyſed / in maner of a
poore marchaunt vpon a lytell Nagge / and
ſo came to London / and tooke his lodgynge
where he was vnknowen / & ſo taryed there
a certayne ſpace and lerned what he coulde.
At laſt he vnderſtode that the kynges vncles
and the newe counſayle of Englande wolde
kepe a ſecrete Parlyament at Weſtmynſter / 
wherfore he thought to go and lye there / to
lerne what ſhulde be doone there. And ſo he

in an al

At laſt on a day aſquyer of the duke of

and withdrewe hym ſelfe out of ye wyndowe
The ſquyer had ſuſpecious therof / and ſayd

Sir quod ſhe I can nat ſhewe you / but he
hath been here a longe ſpace. Therwith the
ſquier went vp the better to aduyſe hym and
ſaluted hym / and ſawe well it was true / but
he fayned hymſelfe and tourned his tale and
ſayde: God ſaue you good man. I pray you
be nat myſcontented / for I toke you for a farmour

Sir quod he I am of Kente / and a farmour

Than they went vp in to the chambre & toke

may be ſure there was great preaſe to ſe hym
for he was well knowen. Of his takyng the

a ſpye. yf ye wolde haue come to haue lerned
tidynges / ye ſhulde haue come in the ſtate of
a knyght. Sir quod Triuylien / if I haue
treſpaſſed I are pardone / for I was cauſed
this to do. Well ſir quod the duke / and where
is your mayſter the duke of Irelande. Sir
quod he / of a trouth he is with the kyng. it is
ſhewed vs here quod the duke that he aſſembleth
moche people / and the kynge for hym.
Wheder wyll he lede that people? Sir quod
he / it is to go in to Ireland. In to Irelande
quod the duke of Glouceſter / yea ſir truely
quod Triuylien. And than the duke ſtudyed
a lytell and ſayde. A Triuylen Triuylien / 
youre buſyneſſe is nouther fayre nor good. ye

haue done great folly to come in to this countre / 
for ye are nat beloued here / and that ſhall
well be ſene. you and ſuche other of your affinyte
haue done great diſpleaſures to my brother
and to me. and ye haue troubled to your
power and with youre yuell counſayle / the
kyng / and dyuers other nobles of ye realme.
Alſo ye haue moued certayne good townes
agaynſt vs. Nowe is the daye come that ye
ſhall haue your payment / for he that dothe
well by reaſon ſhulde fynde it. Thynke on
youre buſyneſſe / for I wyll nother eate nor
drinke tyll ye be deed. That worde greatlye
abaſſhed Triuylen / for gladlye there is no
man wolde here of his ende. He wolde fayne
haue excuſed hym ſelfe with fayre language / 
in lowly humblyng hym ſelf / for he coude do
nothyng to apeaſe the duke / for he was ſo enfourmed
of hym / and of other of the duke of
Irelandes ſecte / that nothyng aueyled hym.
Where to ſhulde I make lengar the mater / 
ſir Robert Triuylien was delyuered to the
hangman / and ſo ledde out of Weſtmynſter
and there beheeded / and after hāged on a gibet.
Thus ended ſir Robert Triuylien.

            ¶Howe tidynges came to the kyng
of the dethe of his knight / & demaū
               ded
counſayle theron: And howe he
ordayned the duke of Irelande ſoueraygne
of all his men of warre.
Capi. xcvii.
            
               SHortely theſe tidyngꝭ
came to kynge Richarde &
to the duke of Irelande beyng
at Briſtowe / howe ſir
Roberte Tryuylyen was
ſhamefully putte to dethe.
The kyng toke that mater
in great diſpite and ſayd and ſware / that the
mater ſhulde nat reſt in that caſe. And howe
that his vncles had done yuell without tytle
or reaſon / to put to dethe his men and knyghtes / 
and ſuche as had truely ſerued hym and
his father the prince: Wherby he ſayde / it ſemed
that they wolde take fro hym the crown
of Englande / and that ye mater touched hym
nere. Than the archbyſſhope of yorke who
was ſouerayne of his counſaile / and had ben
longe / ſaid. Sir ye demaunde coūſayle and
I ſhall gyue you counſayle. your vncles and
ſuche as ben of their accorde / erreth greatly
agaynſt you: for it ſemeth by thē they wolde
ſhewe howe ye be coūſailed but by traytors.
They wolde haue none to beate any rule but
them ſelfe. It is great parell for all ye realme
for if the cōmons ſhulde ryſe and rebell gret
myſchefe ſhulde fall in Englande / if the lordes
and great men be nat frendes toguyder
and all one. Wherfore ſir / I counſayle you
fynde remedy with puiſſaūce. ye are as now
here in a countrey well peopled and named / 
Sende out your cōmaundement to all ſuche
as are boūde to ſerue you / gentylmen and other.
And whan they be all aſſembled / ſende
them in to the marcheſſe of London / & make
your generall capitayne the duke of Irelāde
who gladly wyll take on hym ye charge / and
let no baner nor penon be borne but all onely
yours / to ſhewe therby that the matter toucheth
no man but you. and all the countrey in
goyng thyder / wyll tourne and take parte wt
you and drawe to your baners. and parauenture
the landoners wyll take your parte / for
they hate you nat / for ye dyde them neuer diſpleaſure:
All the hurte ye haue had your vncles
haue cauſed it. Sir / here is ſir Nicholas
Bramble who hath ben mayre of Lōdon / 
and ye made hym knyght / for ſuche ſeruyce
as he dyde you on a daye / who knoweth and
ought to knowe the maner of them of Lōdon
for he was borne ther / and it can nat be but yt
he hath good frēdes there. Therfore ſir / deſire
his coūſail in this mater yt toucheth you
ſo nere. For ſir / by yuell enformacyon & rumoure
of the people / ye maye leſe your ſignorye.
Than the kynge ſpake to ſir Nicholas
Bramble and requyred hym to ſpeke. And at
the kynges requeſt ſir Nycholas ſayd. Sir / 
and it lyke your grace / and all my lordꝭ here
preſent / I ſhall ſpeke gladly / after the lytell
knowledge that I haue. Fyrſt I ſaye I can
nat beleue but that the mooſt ꝑte of the londoners
oweth loue and fauour to the kyng that
here is / for perfitely they loued the prince his
father / and that they well ſhewed / whan the
villayns rebelled / for accordyng to ye trouthe
if they hadde taken parte with the villayns / 
they had diſtroyed the kyng and the realme.

And moreouer / the kynges vncles haue as
nowe a good tyme / for they diſport them ſelfe
among them / and enforme the people as they
lyfte / for there is none to ſaye agaynſt them.
They haue put me out and all the kynges of
fycers / and haue put in them of their affynite
and haue ſente the kynge hyder to one of the
borders of his realme. There can no good be
ymagined of this / nor it can nat be knowen
per
                  ••
               rely what they entende / it is a herde mater.
but by that they ſhewe they wolde putte
the kyng out of his realme / for they go all by
puyſſaunce / and the kynge dothe all by gentylneſſe.
They haue put to dethe that gentyll
knyght ſir Symon Burle / who hath doone
the kyng moche fayre ſeruyce / in the realme
of Englade and in other places. They layde
great falſeneſſe in hym / that he ſhulde haue
delyuered the caſtell of Douer to the frenche
men. And they enformed the people / that he
cauſed the frenchmen to come in to Flaūders
and to Sluſe / whiche was nothyng ſo. And
alſo in the diſpyte of the kyng / they haue ſhā
               fully
ſlayne ſir Robert Triuylien / & ſo they
wyll do other / if they maye atteygne to their
ententes. Wherfore I ſaye / that it were better
for the kyng to vſe rygour and puyſſaūce
than gentylneſſe. Euery man knoweth thorough
the realme that he is kyng / and howe
that at Weſtmynſter ye noble kyng Edwarde
made euery man to be ſworne / bothe lordes / 
prelates / and all the good Townes / that after
his dyſceaſe / they ſhulde take the kynge
here for their ſoueraygne lorde: and the ſame
othe made his thre vncles. And it ſemeth to
many as men dare ſpeke / that they holde him
nat in the ſtate and fourme of a kynge / for he
may nat do with his owne what he lyſt. they
driue hym to his penſyon / and the quene alſo
whiche is a herde thyng for a kyng & a quene
It ſhulde ſeme they wolde ſhewe that they
had no wytte to rule themſelfe / and that their
coūſaylours be traytours. I ſaye theſe thynges
are nat to be ſuffred: As for me I hadde
rather dye / than longe to lyue in this daūger
or peryll / or to ſe the kynge to be ledde as his
vncles wolde haue hym. The kynge thanne
ſayd. Surely it pleaſeth nat vs. and I ſaye / 
ye haue counſayled me as honourably
as maye be / for the honour of
vs and our Realme.
            AT this counſayle at Briſto we it was
ordayned / that the duke of Irelande
ſhulde be ſoueraygne of all the kynges men
of warre ſuche as he coude get / & to go to Lō
               don / 
to knowe the perfyte ententes of the londoners.
Truſtynge / that if he myght ones
ſpeke with them to 
                  •
               ourne them to his acorde
by reaſon of ſuche proftes as he wolde make
them / in the kynges name. And ſo within a
ſhorte ſpace after / the duke of Irelande with
a fyftene thouſand men deꝑted fro Briſtowe
and rode to the cytie of Oxenforde / & there aboute
he lodged and all his people / and had
baners diſplayed of the kynges armes / and
none other / to ſhewe that all he dyde was in
the kynges tytell and quarell. tydingꝭ came
to the kynges vncles / that the duke of Irelande
aproched towardes Lōdon with a .xv.
thouſande men / with the kynges baners diſplayed.
And on a daye all the lordes were at
counſayle at Weſtmynſt
                  •
               r / and had with thē
the chefe of Lōdon / ſuche as they truſted beſt
and there they ſhewed them / how the duke of
Irelāde was comyng agaynſt them with an
armye royall. The londoners who were enclyned
to their partie ſayde. ſirs / let thē come
in the name of god. yf the duke of Irelande
demaūde of vs batayle he ſhall haue it incō
               tynent / 
we will cloſe no gate we haue for. xv
.M. men / nat and they were .xx. The dukes
were right ioyfull with that anſwere / & incō
               tynent
they ſent out knyghtes / ſquyers / and
meſſangers / to aſſemble men of warre togyder
fro dyuers ꝑties: & ſuche as were ſent for
obeyed / for ſo they had ſworne and promyſed
before. Men came fro ye byſihaprike of Caū
               terbury
& Norwiche / and out of the coūties
of Arundell and Suſſex / and of Saliſbury
and Southampton / and out of all the countreis
therabout London. And ſo great nombre
of people came to Lōdon and knewe nat
what they ſhulde do.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Irlande ſente
thre knyghtes to London / to knowe
ſome tydynges. And howe the kynges
vncles & they of London went in
to the feldes to fyght with the duke
of Irelande and his affinyte.
Cap. xcviii.
            
               
               NOwe let vs ſōwhat ſpeke of the
duke of Irelande & of his coūſell
being at Oxford with a .xv.M.
men / howbeit the moſt parte of
them were come thyder by conſtraynt / 
rather than of good corage. Than ye
duke of Irlande aduiſed to knowe thentētes
of thē of Lōdon / & to ſende ſir Nicholas Brā
               ble / 
ſir Peter Golofer / and ſir Michaell de la
Pole to the towre of London / & to go thyder
by water / and to ſet the kynges baners in the
hyght of the towre / to ſe what the londoners
wolde do. Theſe thre knyghtes at ye duke of
Irlandes requeſt deꝑted fro Oxēforde / & the
next day they paſſed the Tēmes at the bridge
of Stanes & rode to dyner to Shene ye kynges
place / and there taryed tyll it was late: &
fro thens rode to another houſe of the kyngꝭ
called Kenyngton / and there they lefte their
horſes / & toke botes & went downe the water
with ye tyde & paſſed Lōdon bridge & ſo came
to the towre / & was nat knowen: for no man
was ware of their comynge. And there they
froūde redy the capitayne of ye towre / whom
the kynge had ſette there before. and by hym
theſe knyghtes knewe moche of the dealyng
of them of Lōdon / and of the kynges vncles.
And the capitayne ſhewed them / howe they
were come thyder to lodge in great daūger.
Why ſo ꝙ they? We be the kynges ſeruaūtes / 
and we may well lodge in his houſe. Nat ſo
quod the capitayne. All this cytie & the counſaile
wolde gladly be vnder the obeyſaūce of
the kyng / ſo that he wolde be ruled by his vncles / 
& by none other. And this that I ſhewe
you is of good wyll / for I am boūde to ſhew
you / and to coūſaile you to the beſt of my power.
but I am in dout to morowe whan day
cometh / & that it be knowen in London that
ſeruauntes of the kynges become hyther. ye
ſhall ſe this towre beſieged / bothe by lande &
water by the londoners / & nat to deꝑte hens
tyll they ſe and knowe who is lodged within
it. And if ye be founde here / ye ſhalbe incontynent
preſented to the kynges vncles: And
than ye may well ymagin what ende ye ſhall
come to. I thynke they be ſo ſore diſpleaſed agaynſt
the kynges coūſayle / and agaynſt the
duke of Irelāde / that & ye be taken / ye ſhall
nat eſcape with your lyues. ſtudy well vpon
theſe wordes / for I aſſure you they be true.
            ¶Than theſe thre knightes who had wende
to haue done marueyls were fore abaſſhed / &
there determyned to tary all night as ſecrete
as they coulde / for feare of ſpyeng. And the capitayne
promyſed to kepe them ſure for that
nyght / and ſo kept the keyes with hym. And
in the mornynge theſe kynghtes had dyuers
ymaginacions & counſayles / to ſe howe they
ſhulde deale. And all thynges cōſydred / they
durſt nat abyde the aduenture to be knowen
there / they feared greatly to be there beſeged
And or day came whan the fludde was come
they tooke a barge and paſſed the bridge and
went to Kenyngton. And whan it was daye
they toke their horſes and rode to Wyndſore / 
and there taryed all that nyght / and the nexte
day they rode to Oxēforde / and there founde
the duke of Irlande & his men / to whom they
ſhewed all theſe tidynges / & howe they durſt
nat tary at the towre of Lōdon. the duke was
penſyfe of thoſe tidynges & wyſt nat what to
ſay nor do / for he knewe well all the people yt
he had aſſembled there / were nat all of one
corage / wherfore he wyſt nat wheder it were
better to retourne to ye kyng or to abide there
He toke counſayle with his knyghtes / & fynally
their coūſayle reſted / that ſythe ye kyng
had ordayned hym to be Conſtable ouer all
his people / and to correcte and to punyſſhe
all rebelles / that he ſhulde kepe the felde / for
if he ſhulde do otherwyſe / it ſhulde be to his
great blame and rebuke / and to bring him in
to the indignacion of the kyng / and to ſhewe
that his quarell were nother good nor right.
And alſo they ſaid / that it was better for him
to dye with honour and to abyde the aduenture / 
than to ſhewe any falſe corage. but they
counſayled hym to ſende worde what caſe he
was in / to the kyng to Briſtowe. As yet they
ſayd bleſſed be god they kepte the feldes / and
none to recoūtre them. So thus ye duke ſent
to the kyng / deſyring hym to ſende hym more
ayde / which the kyng dyde daylye.
            Tidynges came to the kynges vncles being
at Lōdon that the duke of Irlande with
his company were in the marcheſſe of Oxenforde / 
There they toke counſayle what was
beſt for them to do. There was with the kynges
vncles / the archebyſſhop of Caūterbury
the erle of Arundell / the erle of Salyſbury / 
the Erle of Northumberlande / and dyuers
other lordes and knyghtes of Englānde / and
the rulers of London. There it was ordayned

by the duke of Glouceſter / that without
delay they ſhulde iſſue out in to the feldes / &
that the mayre of London ſhulde putte in to
harneſſe all the people in euery warde / ſuche
as wolde ayde them. Sayeng ſurely / howe
they wolde go and fyght with the duke of Irlande / 
wherſoeuer they coude fynde hym. the
mayre of London was as than a man of armes.
He toke choſen men bytwene the age of
twentie yeres and .xl. And the lordes were a
thouſande men of armes. They departed fro
London and went and lodged at Braynford
and there about / and the nexte daye at Colebroke / 
and dayly the nombre encreaſed / and
ſo toke the waye to Redyng / to paſſe the temmes
there aboute / for the bridges bytwene
Wyndſore and Stanes were broken / by the
cōmaundement of the duke of Irelande. So
long they iourneyed that they aproched nere
to Oxenforde. tidynges therof a none came
to the duke of Irelande / than he beganne to
dout and toke counſayle. Than he was coū
               ſayled
to take the feldes / and to put his people
in order of batayle / and to diſplay yt kynges
baners / ſayeng by the grace of god and
ſaynt George the iourney ſhulde be his. As
it was deuyſed ſo it was doone. Than they
ſowned their trumpettes / and euery man armed
hym and iſſued out of Oxenforde in order
of batayle / with the kynges baners diſplayed / 
the day was fayre & clere and a pleaſaunt
ſeaſon.

Than trumpettes ſowned ye diſlodging and

Sir / god and the ryuer is this daye on your

            TIdynges came to the duke of Irelād
howe the kynges vncles were paſſed

and he ſhulde receyue more: In thre
yere other threſcore thouſande frankes. Wherfore
he was nat abaſſhed for he had ſubſtaūce

ſuffycient for a longe ſpace. And whan duke
Aubert of Bauyer / who had Haynalte / Holande
and zelande in gouernaunce / vnder the
erle Willyam his brother / who as than was
lyuynge. Whan he vnderſtode that the duke
of Irelande was come / as a fugetyue out of
Englande / in to the towne of Dordreſt. He
ſtudyed and imagyned a lytell / and thought
he ſhulde nat longe abyde there / ſeynge that
he was fledde out of Englande / and had the
yuell wyll of his coſyn germayns / to whome
he bare his loue and fauour. And alſo he conſydred / 
howe the duke of Irelande had dalte
but yuell with his coſyn germayen / the lady
Iſabell of Englande / who had been lady of
Coucy. Wherfore he commaunded the duke
of Irelande / bycauſe he hadde diſpleaſed his
coſyns of Englande and had broken his laufull
mariage / and wolde mary another wyfe / 
That he ſhulde departe out of that countrey / 
and gette hym another lodgynge / And that
he ſhulde nat be ſuffred to abyde in no towne
of that countrey. Whan the duke herde that / 
he douted that he ſhulde be taken / and delyuered
in to the handes of his enemyes. And he
humyled hym ſelfe greatly to them that were
ſente to hym / and ſayde he wolde gladly obey
the duke Aubertes commaundement. And ſo
payed and truſſed / and entred in to a veſſell
and all his / on the ryuer of Mornegue. And
dyd ſo moche by water and by lande / that he
came to Berette / whiche towne pertayned to
the byſſhoppe of Trece. There he was well
receyued / And there he taryed tyll he harde
other tydinges. Nowe let vs leaue ſpekyng
of hym / and ſpeke of Englande.
            AFter the endynge of this iourney that
the kynges vncles had agaynſte the
duke of Irelāde beſyde Oxenforde / and that
euery man was gone home. The byſſhoppe
of Caunterbury and the two dukes taryed
ſtyll at Oxenforde / I can nat tell howe long.
And there was beheededde the lytell Beauchampe
and ſir Iohan of Saliſbury. After
that iuſtyce the two dukes retourned to Lō
               don / 
and there taryed a ſeaſon to here ſome tidynges
fro the kynge / and they coulde here
none / but that he was at Briſtowe. Thanne
the lordes at Weſtmynſter by the inſtigacion
of the archebyſſhoppe of Caunterbury / determyned / 
that it ſhulde be honourable for
them to ſende to the kynge to Briſtowe / and
to ſhewe hym amyably that he hath ben a certayne
ſpape / agaynſt the mooſt parte of his
realme / who loued hym better and are gladder
to kepe his honour / than ſuche marmoſettes
as he hath beleued / by whom his realme
hath ben in great trouble and peryll. In this
meane ſeaſon was brought to Lōdon ſir Nycholas
Bramble / who was taken in Wales / 
as he fledde from the iourney / to haue ſaued
hym ſelfe / of whoſe takynge the kynges vncles
were right ioyfull and ſayde / howe they
wolde make no ſtoore of hym / but he ſhulde
go the ſame waye as the other hadde done before.
he coude neuer excuſe hymſelfe but that
he muſt dye. He was beheeded without London / 
his dethe was ſore complayned of ſome
men of London / for he hadde been mayre of
London before / and had well gouerned his
offyce / and dyde one day great honour to the
kyng / whan he ſlewe with his owne handes
Lyſter / wherby all the rebelles were diſconfyted / 
and for that good ſeruyce the kynge
made hym knyght. But in the maner (as I
haue ſhewed you) he was beheeded / by reaſon
of the ouermoche beleuynge of the duke
of Irelande.
            AFter the dethe of ſir Nicholas Bramble / 
the kynges vncles ſawe / that all
ſuche as they hated / and wolde haue oute of
the kynges counſayle were deed and fledde a
waye. Than they thought the kynge and the
realme ſhulde be brought in to good order / 
for thoughe they had ſlayne ſome of the kynges
counſayle / and chaſed theym awaye / yet
they coude nat take awaye the ſignorie of the
kyng / but thought to rule the realme in good
forme / to the honour of the kynge and his realme.
Than they ſayd to the byſſhop of Caū
               terbury.
Sir / ye ſhall go lyke your ſelfe to
Briſtowe to the kyng / and there ſhewe hym
what caſe the buſyneſſe of his realme is in / &
recōmaunde vs to hym / & ſhewe hym in our
behalfe / that he gyue no credence of lyght enformacion
agaynſt vs: He hath beleued ſome
to moche for his owne honour / and for the ꝓfyte
of his realme. And ſaye alſo to hym / that
we requyre hym / and ſo do all the good people
of London / that he wolde come hyder / he
ſhalbe welcome & receyued wt gret ioye. & we
ſhall ſet ſuch coūſaile about hym / yt he ſhalbe

well pleaſed. And we charge you retourne
nat agayne withoute hym / and deſyre hym
nat to be diſpleaſed / thoughe we haue chaſed
awaye a meny of traytours that were about
hym / for by them his realme was in great paryll
of leſynge. The byſſhop ſayd he ſhulde
do ryght well his meſſage / and ſo departed
and rodde forthe lyke a great prelate / and ſo
came to Briſtowe / and the kynge was there
but with a priuye cōpany: For ſuche as were
wont to haue ben of his counſayle were deed
and fledde awaye / as ye haue herde before.
The byſſhop was in the towne two nightes
and a day or ye kyng wolde ſpeke with hym / 
He was ſo ſoore dyſpleaſed with his vncles / 
for driuynge awaye of the duke of Irelande
whome he loued aboue all men / and for ſleeynge
of his knyghtes. Finally he was ſo entyſed / 
that he conſented that the archbyſſhop
ſhulde come in to his preſens. Whan he came
before hym he humyled hym ſelfe greatlye to
the kynge / and there ſhewed the kyng euery
worde as the kynges vncles had gyuen hym
in charge. And ſhewed hym / that if it were
his pleaſure to come to Londou to his palys
of Weſtmynſter / his vncles and the mooſte
parte of all his realme wolde be ryght ioyeouſe / 
elles they wyll be ryght ſorte and yuell
diſpleaſed / And ſayde ſir. Without the comforte / 
ayde / and accorde of your vncles / and
of your lordes / knyghtes / and prelates: and
of your good cyties and townes of Englāde
ye canne nat come to any of youre ententes.
He ſpake theſe wordes boldelye / and ſayde
moreouer. Sir / ye canne nat reioyſe ſo moche
youre ennemyes / as to make warre with
youre frendes / and to kepe youre Realme in
warre and myſchiefe. The yonge kynge by
reaſone of the byſſhoppes wordes beganne
to enclyne / howe be it the beheedynge of his
knyghtes and counſaylours / came ſore in to
his courage. So he was in dyuers ymaginacions / 
but finally he refrayned his diſpleaſure / 
by the good meanes of the quene / ye lady
of Boeſme / and of ſome other wiſe knightes
that were about hym / as ſir Rycharde Stoner
and other. Thanne the kyng ſayd to the
byſſhoppe. Well / I am content to go to Lō
               don
with you. wherof the biſſhop was right
ioyous / and alſo it was to hym a great honoure / 
that he hadde ſpedde his iourney ſo
well.
            
               WIthin a ſhorte ſpace after / the
kyng departed & lefce the quene
ſtyll at Briſtowe / and ſo came
towardes London with ye archbyſſhoppe
in his company / and
ſo came to Wyndſore / and there the kyng taryed
a thre dayes. Tidynges came to London
howe the kynge was commynge / euery
manne was gladde. Than it was ordayned
to mete hym honourablye. The daye that he
departed fro Wyndſore / the way fro Braynforde
to London was full of people / on horſe
backe and a foote to mete the kynge. And his
two vncles / the duke of yorke and the duke
of Glouceſter / and Iohan ſonne to the duke
of yorke / the erle of Arundell / the erle of Saliſbury / 
the erle of Northumberlande / and
dyuers other lordes and knyghtes. and prelates
departed out of London / & mette with
the kyng a two myle fro Braynforde. There
they receyued hym ſwetely / as they ought to
do their ſoueraygne lorde. The kynge / who
bare yet ſome diſpleaſure in his herte paſſed
by / and made but ſmall countenaunce to thē / 
and all the waye he talked mooſt with the biſſhop
of Lōdon: at laſt they came to Weſtmī
               ſter.
The kyng alyghted at his palis whiche
was redy apparelled for him. There ye kyng
dranke and toke ſpyces / and his vncles alſo / 
and other Prelates / lordes / and knyghtes.
Than ſome tooke their leaues. The kynges
vncles and the archebyſſhoppe of Caunterburye
with the counſayle / taryed ſtyll there
with the kyng / ſome in the Palais and ſome
in the abbey and in the towne of weſtminſter
to kepe the kynge company / and to be nere toguyder
co commune of their buſyneſſe. there
they determyned what ſhulde be done.

            ¶Howe by the kynge and his vncles
all the lordes of Englande were
ſente for to come to weſtmynſter / to
a generall counſayle there to be holden.
Cap. C.i.
            
               
               A Generall Parlyament
was ordeyned to be holden
at Weſtmynſtre / and all prelates / 
Erles / Barons / and
knyghtes / and ye counſayles
of all the good townes and
cytees of Englāde were ſent
for to be there / and all ſuche
as helde of the kyng. The archebyſſhoppe of
Cauntorbury ſhewed to the kynges vncles &
counſayle that when kynge Rycharde was
crowned kynge of Englande / and that euery
man was ſworne and made theyr releues to
hym / and that whā he receyued theyr faythes
and homages he was within age / and a knyge
ought nat to gouerne a royalme tyll he be
xxi. yeres of age / and in the meane ſeaſon to
be gouerned by his vncles / or by his nexte
kynne / and by wyſe men. The byſſhop ſayd
this bycauſe the kynge as then was but newlye
come to the age of .xxi. yeres / wherfore he
counſayled that euery man ſhulde be newe
ſworne / and renewe their releues / and euery
manne newe to knowledge hym for their ſoueraygne
lorde. This counſayle was excepted
of the kynges vncles / and of all other of
the coūſayle. And for that entent all prelates
and lordes / and counſayles of good cyties &
townes were ſent for to come to Weſtminſter
at a daye aſſigned. Euery man came thyder / 
none diſobeyed / ſo that there was moche people
in London and at Weſtmiſter. And kyng
Richarde was in his chapell in the palys / rychely
apareyled with his crowne on his heed
and the archebyſſhoppe of Caūterbury ſang
the maſſe. And after maſſe ye biſſhoppe made
a collaſyon. And after that the kyngꝭ vncles
dyde their homage to the kyng & kyſſed hym / 
and there they ſware and ꝓmyſed hym faithe
and homage for euer And than all other lordes
ſware / and prelates / and with their handes
ioyned togyder they dyde their homage / 
as it aparteyned / and kyſt the kynges cheke.
Some the kyng kyſt with good wyll & ſome
nat / for all were nat in his in warde loue but
it behoued hym ſo to do / for he wolde nat go
fro the counſayle of his vncles / But ſurely / 
if he might haue had his entent he wolde nat
haue done as he dyde / but rather haue taken
crewell vengeaunce / for the deche of ſir Symon
Burle / and other knyghtꝭ that they had
putte fro hym and ſlayne without deſert as
he thought. Than it was ordayned by ye coū
               ſayle / 
that the archebyſſhop of yorke ſhulde
come and pourge hym ſelfe / for he hadde alwayes
been of the duke of Irelandes parte / 
agaynſt the kynges vncles. Whan yt byſſhop
of yorke herde of this he douted hym ſelfe / for
he knewe well / he was nat in ye fauour of the
kynges vncles. Therfore he ſente his excuſe
by a nephue of his / ſonne to the lorde Neuell
and he came to London / and came firſt to the
kynge / and ſhewed hym his vncles excuſe / &
dyde his homage in the byſſhoppes behalfe.
The kyng toke it well / for he loued hym better
than the byſſhoppe of Caunterbury / and
ſo he hym ſelfe excuſed the byſſhoppe / or elles
it had ben yuell with him / but for the kynges
loue they forbare hym & toke his excuſe / and
ſo he taryed ſtyll in his byſſhoprike a longe
ſpace and durſte nat lye at yorke / but taryed
at New caſtell on the ryuer of Tyne / nere to
his brother the lorde Neuell and his coſyns.
In this eſtate was at that tyme the buſyneſſe
of Englande / and ſo of a longe ſpace ye kyng
was nat mayſter ouer his counſayle / but his
vncles and other bare all the rule. Nowe we
wyll leaue to treat of the maters of Englāde
and ſpeke of the buſyneſſe of the kyng of Caſtyle
and of the kynge of Portyngale / and of
their warres.

            ¶Howe the kynge of Portyngale
with his puiſſan̄ce aſſembled with
the duke of Lancaſtre and his puyſſaunce / 
& howe they coude nat paſſe
the ryuer of Derne / & howe a ſquyer
of Caſtyle ſhewed thē the paſſage.
Cap. C.ii.
            
               IT is reaſon ſythe the
mater ſo requyreth / that I
retourne agayne to ye duke
of Lācaſtres iourney / and
howe he ꝑceyuered al this
ſeaſon in Galyce / I ſhall
begyn there as I lefte / for
I haue great deſyre to make an ende of that
ſtorie. Whan the duke of Lancaſtre had won

and conquered the towne and caſtell of Dauranche
in Galyce / and brought it vnder his
obeyſaunce / and refreſſhed hym there foure
dayes / for there he founde well wherwith.
Than the fyfthe day he departed / and ſayde
he wolde go to the caſtell of Noy / and ſo he
dyde / and lay four dayes in a fayre medowe
alonge a ryuer ſyde. But the grounde was
dried vp by reaſon of the heate of the ſonne / 
and the water corrupted / ſo that their horſes
wolde nat drinke therof / and ſuche as dyde / 
dyed. Thanne it was ordayned to diſlodge
thens / and to tourne agayne to Auranch / for
ſir Richarde Burle and ſir Thomas Morryaulx
marſhalles of the hooſt / ſayd it was
nat poſſyble to get the ſtrong raſtell of Noy
but by longe ſiege / by great wyſedome and
diſpence / and moche artillary. And alſo tydinges
came to the duke of Lancaſtre / that
the kynge of Portugale approched with all
his hooſt / to the nombre of a thouſande ſpeares / 
and tenne thouſande able men. So that
the two hooſtes togyder were lykely to do a
great dede / for the duke of Lancaſtre hadde
a fyftene hundred ſpeares knightes and ſquiers / 
and a ſixe thouſande archers. Theſe tydinges
reioyſed greatly the duke of Lancaſtre / 
and ſo diſlodged fro Noy and wente agayne
to Auranche in Galyce / and the duke
ſente for the ducheſſe his wyfe / and the other
ladyes and damoſelles: for the duke ſayd he
wolde abyde there for the kynge of Portugale / 
and ſo he dyde.
            
               yE ſhall knowe / that whan kyng Iohan
of Portugale and his marſhalles
had take the towne of Feroullꝭ
they rode and aproched Auranch to come to
the duke of Lācaſtre. And in their way they
founde the towne of Padrone / whiche rebelled
againſt thē / but at their firſt comyng they
yelded them to the kynges obeyſaunce. The
kynge taryed there and in the marches there
about a fyftene dayes / and waſted greatlye
the countrey of vitayls / & yet they had great
plentie comyng dayly fro Portugale. Thus
theſe two great hooſtes were in Galyce / and
greatly impoueryſſhed the countre / and the
dayes waxed ſo hote / yt no man coude ſtyrre
after nyne of the clocke / without he wolde be
brent with the ſonne. The duke of Lācaſtre
and the ducheſſe were at Aurache / and their
men abrode in the countrey in great pouerie
for lacke of vitayls / for thē ſelfe and for their
horſes. Nothynge that was good or ſwete
coulde growe out of the grounde / it was ſo
drie / and brent with the ſōne / and that grewe
was lytell worthe / for the ſeaſon was ſo hote
that all was brent. And the Englyſſhe men / 
if they wolde haue any thynge for them ſelfs
or▪ for their horſes / it behoued them or their
ſeruauntes to go a forragyng / a .xii. ſixtene / 
or twentie myles of / which was great payne
and daunger. And the Englyſſhmen founde
the wynes there ſo ſtronge / hoote / and brynning
that it corrupted their heedes and dried
their bowelles / and brente their lightes and
lyuers / & they had no remedy / for they coude
fynde but lytell good waters to temper their
wynes nor to refreſſhe them / whiche was cō
               trary
to their natures. For Englyſſhe men
in their owne coūtreis are ſwetely noriſſhed
and there they were brēt both within & with
out / they endured great pouertie. The great
lordes wanted of that they were accuſtomed
vnto in their owne countreis.
            
               wHan the knyghtes and ſquyers and
other of Englande / ſawe the daunger
and myſchefe that they were in / 
and were likely to be / what for lacke of vytayle
and heate of the ſonne / whiche dayly encreaſed.
Than they began to murmure and
to ſaye in the hoſt in dyuers places. We feare
our iourney wyll come to a ſmal effect & ende
We lye to long in one place. that is true ſayd
other. There is two thynges greatly contrarye
for vs. We leade in our company women
and wyues who deſyreth nothyng but reſt / &
for one dayes iourney by their wylles / they
wolde reſte fyftene. This diſtroyeth vs and
wyll do / for as ſoone as we came to Coulongne / 
if we had gone forwarde we had ſpedde
well / and brought the countre to good obeyſaunce / 
for none wolde haue ben agaynſt vs.
But the longe taryeng hath enforced our ennemyes / 
for nowe they haue prouyded them
of men of warre out of Fraunce / And by thē
their townes / cyties / and paſſages be kepte
and cloſed agaynſt vs. Thus they diſconfyted
vs withoute batayle: They nede nat to
fyght with vs / for the realme of Spayne is
nat ſo pleaſaunt a lande to traueyle in / as is
Fraunce or Englande / wherin are good villages / 

fayre coūtreis and ſwete ryuers / faire
medowes and attemperate ayre for menne of
warre / and here is all the contrarye. What
ment oure lorde the duke of Lancaſtre (if he
thought to wynne this countrey) to leade in
his company women and chyldren? This is
a great let and without reaſon / for it is knowen
in all Spaygne / and els where / that he
and his bretherne are the true enherytours
of the countrey / at leeſt their wyfes doughters
to kyng Don Peter. As for doyng of any
conqueſt or tournyng of any townes / the
women do lytell therin.
            THus as I haue ſhewed you the people
langled in the duke of Lancaſters
hooſt / one to another. Than tidynges came
to the duke that the kyng of Portugale aproched
nere wherof he was ioyfull. And whan
the kynge was within two leages / the duke
with his knyghtes mounted on their horſes
and rode to mete hym / and there they mette amiably
and all their companyes. The kynges
hole hooſt was nat there but taryed behynde / 
in the guydyng of ſixe great lordes of
Portugale / as Ponnaſe of Congne / Vaſe
Martyn de merlo / Poſdiche de aſne degouſe
Salnaſe de Merlo / ſir Anlne Perrier marſhall / 
and Iohan Radighes Deſar / and dyuers
other / and the kyng had with him a thre
hundred ſpeares. So at Aurāche the kynge
and the duke were togyder. a fyue dayes and
toke counſayle toguyder. The fynall concluſyon
was / that they ſhulde ryde togyder and
enter in to the countrey of Campe and to go
to the towne of Arpent / where ſir Olyuer of
Cleſquyne conſtable of Spaygne was / but
they wyſt nat how to paſſe ye ryuer of Derne
whiche was fell and orgulous at certayne tymes / 
& ſpecially rather in ſomer than in wynter / 
for whan the ſnowe and froſte melteth on
the moūtayns by reaſon of the ſonne / than is
the ryuer mooſt depeſt & moſt dangerous to
paſſe / for in wynter it is froſyn / & than the ryuers
are but baſe and lowe. yet for all yt they
concluded to ryde in to the coūtre of Campe / 
truſtyng at ſome place to fynde ſome paſſage
This concluſyon was publyſſhed throughe
all their hooſtes / wherof euery man was ioyfull / 
for they had lyen along ſpace ſore oppreſſed
and in great daunger at Auranche & ther
about / and many were ſore diſeaſed.
            Thus the kyng of Portugale and yt duke
of Lācaſtre departed fro Auranche and rode
toguyder / but their hoſtes were ſeperated in
to two partes / bycauſe none of them vnderſtode
other / nor had no maner of aqueyntāce
toguyder: And alſo to eſchewe riottes or debates
that myght haue fallen bytwene them / 
for portugales are hote & haſtye / and in lykewiſe
Englyſſhmen be diſpytefull and fierſe.
Thus they were apoynted by the man hals
of bothe hoſtes to lodge and to forrage in diuers
partes / and nat toguyder. Thus they
rode forthe and were of chat. puyſſaunce able
to fyght for a iourney with kynge Iohan of
Caſtell / and all his adhenrentes. So longe
they iourneyed that they came to they ryuer
of Derne / whiche was nat eaſy to paſſe / for it
was depe and with highe bankes / and full of
great broken ſtones / ſo that but at certayne
bridges whiche were broken / or elles ſo well
kepte / yt it was in maner impoſſyble to paſſe
they might nat gette ouer. So theſe two hoſtes
had great ymaginaciōs how they might
paſſe. Than ſo it fell that ſir Iohn̄ Holande
who was conſtable of the Englyſſhe hooſt / 
and the marſhalles / ſir Richarde Butle and
ſir Thomas Moreaulx / and their forragers
as they rode before / they encountred a ſquier
of Caſtell / called Donnage Bangher. He
knewe well all the paſſages of the countrey / 
and he knewe where there was one paſſage / 
that bothe horſmen and fote men might eaſelye
paſſe the riuer / & he came ouer at the ſame
paſſage / and was taken and brought to the
ſayd lordes / of whom they were ryght glad.
And there he was ſo ſtreitly examyned / & alſo
by the wordes of the conſtable / who ſayde to
hym / howe he wolde quyte his raūſome and
gyue hym a good rewarde if he wolde ſhewe
them where they myght paſſe ſurely the ryuer / 
for they ſayde they had herde howe there
was one ſure paſſage ouer the ryuer. The
ſquyer who toke but lyght aduyſement / and
was couetous of the conſtables offre / & was
gladde to be delyuered out of their handes / 
ſayd. Sirs / I knowe well the paſſage / and
I ſhall ſhewe it you and ſhalbe your guyde
where as ye and all youre menne maye paſſe
without any daunger.
            Of this the conſtable and marſhalles had
great ioye & ſo rode forthe toguyder / and ſent

worde of this tydinges to the duke of Lancaſtre / 
and ſo folowed the vowarde / and the conſtables
and marſhalles came to the paſſage.
Than the ſpanyſſhe ſquyer entred firſte in to
the ryuer / & ſhewed them the way. And whan
they ſawe the paſſage ſo pleaſaunt they were
ryght ioyfull / and ſo euery man paſſed ouer.
And whan the vowarde was ouer / they lodged
there to gyue knowledge to all other that
folowed after. Than the conſtable kepte his
promyſe with the ſquyer that was their gyde.
And ſo he departed fro them and rode to Medena
del campo / where the kynge of Caſtyle
lay / a good towne in the countrey of Campe.
Than the kynge of Portugale and the duke
of Lancaſtre came to the paſſage / which was
called Plaſce ferarde / bycauſe the grauell and
ſande there was firme and ſtable / and without
parell. There they and their hooſtes paſſed ouer / 
and the next day the rerewarde / and than
they all lay in the coūtrey of Campe. Tydinges
came to them of Ruelles / of Cateſeris / of
Medena / of Vyle arpente / of ſaynt Phagon / 
and to other cyties / townes / and caſtels of the
countrey of Campe and Spayne / howe the
englyſſhemen and portugaloyſe were paſſed
ouer the ryuer of Derne / and had founde the
paſſed / wherof euery man had maruayle and
ſayd. This can nat be done without trayſon / 
for they ſhulde neuer haue founde out the paſſage / 
but if ſome of the countre had ſhewed it
to them. The kynge of caſtelles lordes knewe
how the ſquier of Caſtyle had ſhewed it them / 
and was their guyde. Thervpon he was taken
and knowledged the trouth / as he hadde
done. Thanne he was iuged to dye / and was
brought to Vyle arpent and there beheeded.
         
         
            ¶Howe the tydinges ſpred abrode
that the kynge of Portugale and the
duke of Lancaſtre were paſſed the ryuer
of Derne / & howe it came to the
kyng of Caſtels knowlege. & howe
certayne of the englyſſhe knyghtes
came and rode before Vyle arpente / 
and how the king of Portugale and
the duke of Lancaſtre determyned
there to tary the cōmyng of the duke
of Burbone. Cap. C.iii.
            
               WHan the kynge of Caſtyle
knewe howe the kyng
of Portugale and the duke
of Lancaſtre were in yt feldes
with a great puyſſance
and daily aproched wherof
he was ſore abaſſhyd / and
called to hym ſyr Gaultyer of Paſſac and ſyr
Willyam of Lignac / and ſayde. I haue great
maruayle of the duke of Borbon / that he commeth
nat. Our enemyes aproche and kepe the
feldes / and none encoūtreth them. they waſte
our countrey / and the people of my realme are
yuell contente that we fyght nat with theym.
Wherfore ſirs / I requyre you gyue me counſayle
what is beſt to do. Theſe two knyghtes
who knewe more of dedes of armes than the
kyng dyd / for they had more vſed it / and therfore
thyder they were ſente oute of Fraunce / 
they ſayde: Syr / ſurely the duke of Borbon
cometh without fayle. And whan he cometh
we ſhall take counſayle what we ſhall do / but
tyll he come / let vs make no countenaunce of
batayle. Let our enemyes go and come whyder
as they lyſt / lette them kepe the feldes and
we ſhall kepe the townes that be ſtronge / and
well prouyded bothe with men and vytayles.
They ſhall be in the ſonne and in great heate / 
and we ſhall be in the ſhadowe & in the freſſhe
ayre. They ſhall fynde ye countrey waſted and
pylled / and the more forewarde that they go / 
the leſſe ſuſtynaūce ſhall they fynde. And therfore
ſyr / at the begynnynge to eſchewe all inconuenyentes / 
all lytell hooldes were beaten
downe / and maners & churches ſuche as men
of the coūtrey wold haue put in their goodes / 
and this was wyſely done. or els nowe your
enemyes ſhuld haue founde places to haue reſted
in / and as nowe they ſhall fynde nothyng
without they brynge it with theym / but heate
and the ſonne on their heedes / the whiche ſhall
burne and ſlee them. And ſir all your townes / 
cyties / and caſtelles are well garnyſſhed and
prouyded for with good men of armes / artyllery / 
and vytayles. I thynke they ſhalbe ſkrymyſſhed
withall / for that is the lyfe and noryſſhynge
of men of warre and their paſſe tyme / 
for they ryde aboute all the worlde to ſeke aduentures.
Therfore ſir be nothynge abaſſhed
for we truſte in this beſynes / we ſhall haue no
great domage. The kynge by reaſon of theſe
knyghtes wordes was greatly recōforted / for

he perceyued well they ſhewed him the trouth
and reaſon.
            NOwe let vs ſpeke of the duke of Lancaſtre
& of the kyng of Portugale / who
were in the feldes in the countrey of Campe.
They wolde gladly haue bene in ſome towne
to haue refreſſhed theym / For their foragers
whe
                  •
                ſo euer they went / coude fynde no thing
and for feare of encountrynges / they rode nat
but in great companyes. And ſomtyme whan
they ſawe a village on a hyll / or on the playne / 
than they reioyſed and wolde ſay. Go we thyder / 
for there we ſhalbe all ryche / and well prouyded / 
And thyder they wolde ryde in great
haſte. And whan they were there / they founde
no thynge but bare walles / & the howſes broken
downe / and nother catte nor dogge / cocke
nor hen / man / woman / nor childe there / it was
waſted before by the frenchemen. Thus they
loſte their tyme / and their horſes were leane
and feble / by reaſon of their poore noriſſhyng.
They were happy whan they founde any paſture / 
and ſome were ſo feble that they coulde
go no further / but dyed for great heate and pouertie.
ye and alſo ſome of the great men dyed
and were ſore dyſpleaſed with hoote feuers / &
had nat wherwith to refreſſhe them / and ſome
tyme by ſodeyn coldee that toke them ſleping
in ye nyght. In this caſe they were in / and ſpecyally
in the duke of Lancaſtres hooſt / for the
engliſſhmen were of a febler complexion than
the portugaloys / for they coulde well endure
the payne / for they he harde and accuſtomed
to the ayre of Caſtyle. In this caſe as I haue
ſhewed you the engliſſhmen were in / and many
dyed / and namely ſuche as had but ſmale
prouiſyon for them ſelfe.

ſuche as wolde auaunce theym ſelfe / and deſyringe
dedes of armes. It a tyme mounted
on their horſes the beſte they hadde / to the entente
to ryde to Vyle Arpente / to awake the
frēchmen that were therin / for they had herde
ſurely howe ſir Dlyuer of Clyſſon was within
that towne / who was conſtable of Caſtyle / 
and with hym a great nombre of good men of
armes. Theſe lordꝭ with their company rode
forthe in a morenynge / and came to a lytell ryuer
that ranne before the towne / and paſſed
ouer. The larome roſe in the towne and brute
that the englyſſhe men were come to the barryers.
Thanne knyghtes and ſquiers armed
them quickely / and came to the cōſtables lodginge / 
and their varlettes ſadled their horſes
and brought thē to their maiſters. the conſtable
wolde nat by his wyll haue ſuffered them
to haue iſſued out agaynſte the englyſſhmen / 
but he coulde nat let them / their corages were
ſo fierſe: And ſo they iſſued out well horſed / 
and in good ordre. Firſte iſſued ſir Iohan of
Barres / the vicounte of Barlier / ſir Iohan of
Brakemoūt / ſir Pyer of Wyllannes / ſir Triſtam
de la gayll and dyuers other / with great
deſyre to fyght agaynſt the engliſſhmen. And
whan the englyſſhmen had made their courſe
before the towne / than they paſſed agayne the
ryuer / where as they had paſte / and drewe to
gyther on ye ſandes / and fayre and eaſely with
drewe fro the ryuer a thre bowſhottes. Than
the frenche knightes came cryeng their cryes
euery manne his ſpeare on the thyghe. And
whan the Englyſſhmen ſawe them / ſodeynly
they tourned with their ſpeares in the reſtes.
There was a ſore rencoūtre / and dyuers ouer
throwen on the ſandes / on bothe parties. And
whan that courſe was done they lefte nat ſo / 
but ſkrymyſſhed to gyther / but the powder of
the ſubtyle ſandes roſe vp ſo thycke / that one
of them coulde natſe a nother / nor knowe eche
other / ſo that themſelfe nor their horſes could
ſkant drawe their brethes / their mouthes were
ſo full of duſt / So that therby eche party was
fayne to withdrawe by their cries. Thus they
departed / and no manne ſlayne / nor greatly
hurte. And bycauſe of this courſe that the englyſſhe
knyghtes made / they paſte that daye
but one leage fro the towne of Arpente / and ſo
retourned to their lodgynges / and ſyckneſſe
toke them / heate / colde / and feuers. The duke
of Lancaſtre wyſte nat what to ſaye nor do / 
for he ſawe well howe his men fell ſicke dayly
and lay in their beddes. And he was hymſelfe
ſoo wery and heuy / that gladly he wolde haue
layen in his bedde / and it had nat ben for diſcoragynge
of his people. And on a day he ſpake
with the kynge of Portugale / and demaunded

counſayle of hym / deſyringe hym to gyue
his beſte aduyſe what was beſte to do / for he
feared great mortalyte to fall in his hoſt. than
the kyng ſayd. Syr / it ſemeth well howe that
the ſpaynyardes nor frēchmen wyll nat fyght
with vs at this time / they purpoſe to ſuffre vs
to waſte our ſelfes and our prouyſions. Why
ſir quod the duke / and what wyll ye than coū
               ſayle

Portugale. as for this ſeaſon whyle the ſonne
is ſo hoote / that ye and your people drawe againe
in to Galyce / and let euery man refreſſh
him ſelfe / and at Marche or Aprill than come
to the felde agayne. and do ſo moch that newe
ayde and comfortemaye come to you oute of
Englande by one of your bretherne. A realme
is nat ſo ſoone wonne / and ſpecyally to agree
with the ayre nat acuſtomed before. Let your
men go and paſſe their tyme in ſuche townes
and fortereſſes as ye haue in Galyce / vnder
your obeyſaunce. This may well be quod the
duke / but than maye fortune to fall / as I ſhall
ſhewe you / that is. Whan our enemyes ſeeth
that we be departed one fro another / you into
Portugale & I into Galyce / at ſaynt Iaques
or at Colongne. Than the kynge of Spayne
wyll ryde with great puyſſaunce / for I haue
herde that he hathe foure thouſande ſpeares / 
frenchmen and bretons / and he ſhall fynde as
many mo in his owne countrey. And alſo the
duke of Burbon vncle to the frenche kyng cometh
after with two. M. ſpeares / and aſſone
as he cometh he wyll ſet forwarde: ſo that & we
be than at home in oure countreys / or we can
aſſemble togyder agayne / as we be nowe / out
enemyes ſhall do vs great domage. Thanne
the kynge ſayde. Well / than lette vs kepe ſtyll
the feldes in the name of god / as for my men
be freſſhe ynough / and are of good mynde to
abyde the aduenture / and I with them.
            
               THus they determyned to abyde
the cōmynge of the duke of Burbon / 
to ſe if they ſhulde be fought
withall thanne or nat / for they all
demaūded nothinge but batayle.
The tyme went euer forwarde and the ſonne
mounted / and the dayes chafed meruaylouſly
for it was aboute mydſomer / whan the ſonne
was in his ſtrength / and ſpecially in Spayne
and Granade / and in the farre countreyes of
Septentryon. Nor after Aprell there fell no
rayne nor ſwetnes fro Heuyn / wherby euery
thynge was brente on the erthe. The engliſſh
men eate grapes whan they myght get them / 
and dranke of the hote wynes / and the more
they dranke the more they were ſet a fyre / and
therby brente their lyuers and longes / for that
dyete was contrary to their nature. Englyſſh
men are noriſſhed with good metes and with
ale / which kepeth their bodyes in temper: and
there the nyghtes were hoote / bycauſe of the
great heate in the day / and the mornyng meruaylouſly
colde / whiche dyſceyued them. For
in the nyght they coulde ſuffre no thynge on
them / and ſo ſlepte all naked / and in the mornynge
colde toke them or they were waxe / and
that caſte them in to feuers and flyxes without
remedy. And as well dyed great men as

coulde neuer haue loſte by
batayle / nor his men dyſcomfetted / 
nor loſte his men as he dyd in that
voyage / by reaſon of ſycknes. And hym ſelfe
alſo nygh deed. And ſir Iohan Holande who
was conſtable of the hooſt / whan he ſawe his
frendes and men thus infected with this malady / 
without remedy / and herynge the complayntꝭ
of one and other / ſayeng eche to other.
Ah the duke of Lancaſtre hath brought vs to
dye in Spaygne / curſed be this voyage? He
wyll neuer haue Englyſſhman more to come
out of Englande to ſerue hym. He ſpurneth agaynſt
ye pricke / he wolde his men ſhulde kepe

ſheweth nat that he can any ſkyll of the warre / 
ſythe he ſeeth that none cometh agaynſt vs to
fight in batayle. why dothe he nat drawe than
into Portugale or into ſome other place? than
he ſhulde nat haue the domage nor loſſe that
he heth / for thus we ſhall all dye without any
ſtrokes. Whan ſir Iohan Holande herde and
vnderſtode theſe wordes / for the honoure and
loue of his lorde the duke of Lancaſtre / whoſe
doughter he had maryed / he came to the duke
and ſayd quickly to him. Sir / it muſt behoue
you to take newe and ſhorte counſayle / your
people be in a harde caſe / and lykely to dye by
ſyckeneſſe / if nede ſhulde fortune they are nat
able to ayde you. they be wery and in a harde
caſe / and their horſes deed / ſo that noble men
and other are ſo diſcoraged that they are nat
lyke to do you any good ſeruyce at this tyme.
Than ſayd the duke. And what is beſte than
to do / I wyll beleue counſaile for it is reaſon?
Syr quod the conſtable. Me thynke it were
beſte ye gaue lycence to euery man to departe
where as they thynke beſte / and your ſelfe to
drawe outher into Portugale or into Galice / 
for ye are nat in the caſe to ryde forewarde.
That is trewe quod the duke / and ſo I wyll
do. Saye you to them howe I do gyue them
leaue to departe whyder it pleaſe thē / outher
in to Caſtyle or in to Fraunce / ſo they make
no falſe treaty with our enemyes / for I ſe well
for this ſeaſon our warre is paſte / And paye
euery man their wages / and rewarde theym
for their coſtes. Syr quod the conſtable this
ſhall be done.
            SIr Iohan Holande made it be knowen
by a trumpet in euery lodgyng / the entencion
of the duke of Lancaſtre / howe he dyd
gyue lycence to euery man to departe / whyder
they lyſt / and that euery capytayne ſhulde
ſpeke with the conſtable / and they ſhulde be
ſo payed that they ſhulde be content. This tydynges
reioyſed ſome / ſuche as deſyred to departe
to chaunge the ayre. Than the barones
and knyghtes of Englande toke counſayle / 
howe they myght retourne in to Englande. it
was thought impoſſyble for them to retourne
by the ſee / for they had no ſhyppes redy / and
were farre fro any porte. And alſo their men
were ſo ſicke with feuers and flixes / that there
were many deed / and ſo ſicke / that they coude
nat endure ye trauayle on the ſee. So all thynges
conſydered they thought it beſt to repayre
home thorough the realme of Fraunce. Than
ſome ſayde / howe maye that be? for we be enemyes
too all the realmes that we muſte paſſe
through. Firſt through Spayne / for we haue
made theym open warre. The kynge of Nauer
in lykewyſe is ioyned in this warre with
the kynge of Caſtyle / & alſo the kynge of Aragone / 
for he is alyed with the frenche kynge.
and alſo he hath done to vs a great dyſpite / he
hath take and layd in priſon at Barſelona the
archebyhop of Burdeaux / who wente thyder
to demaunde the arerages that the realme of
Aragonoweth / to the kynge of Englande our
ſoueraygne lorde. And to ſende to the frenche
kyng it is harde for vs to do. it is farre of / and
peraduenture whan oure meſſanger cometh
to the kynge (he is yonge) and peraduenture
his counſayle wyll do nothynge for vs. for ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon conſtable of Fraunce hateth
vs mortally / for he wyll ſay that the duke
of Bretayn his great aduerſary / wyll become
engliſſh. Than ſome other that were of great
wyſdome and imaginacyon ſaid. All thinges
conſydred / we thinke it beſt to aſſay the kyng
of Caſtyle / we thynke he wyll lyghtly condyſcende
to ſuffre vs to paſſe through his countrey
peaſably / and to gette a ſaueconduete fro
the kynges of Fraunce / Aragon / and Nauer.
            THis counſayle was taken / kepte and
herde / and a Haraulde called Derby
was ſente forthe to the kynge of Caſtyle with
letters. This haraulde rode forthe and came
to Medena de campo / and there he founde the
kynge of Caſtyle / and than he kneled downe
and delyuered his letters. And the kynge opened
them and redde them / they were written
in frenche. Whan he hadde well vnderſtande
them he turned hym and ſmyled / and ſayde to
a knyght of his. Go and make this haraulde
good chere / he ſhall be anſwered to nyght and
departe to morowe. Than the kynge entred
in to his ſecrete chambre and ſent for ſir Wyllyam
of Lygnac and for ſir gaultyer of Paſſac / 
and red to them the letters / and demaunded
of them what was beſte to do. ¶I ſhall

deſyring hym to ſende by the herault letters
of ſafecōducte for .ii. or thre englyſſhe knightes
to go and come ſafe / to ſpeke and to treat
with hym. Than theſe knightes anſwered &
ſayd. ſir / it were good ye dyde this / for than
ſhall you knowe what they demaūde. Well
quod the kyng / me thynke it is good. Than
there was aſafecōducte written / cōteyninge
that ſixe knightes might ſafely go and come
at the poyntyng of the conſtable. This was
ſealed with the kynges great ſeale & ſygned
with his hande & deliuered to the heralt / and
xx. frankes in rewarde. Than he returned to
Aurāche where the duke & ye conſtable were.
            
               THe herault deliuered the ſafecōduct
to the cōſtable. Than the knyghtes
were choſen yt ſhulde go. ſir Mauberyn
of Linyere / ſir Thom̄s Morell / & ſir
Iohan Dambreticourt. theſe thre knyghtes
were charged to go on this meſſage to ye kynge
of Caſtile. and they deꝑted aſſone as they
might for ſome thought long / for there were
many ſicke and lacked phiſicions and medicins / 
and alſo freſſhe vitaylles. Theſe Englyſſhe
ambaſſadours paſſed by the towne
of Arpent / and there the conſtable of Caſtyle
ſir Olyuer of Cleſquy made thē good chere / 
and made them a ſupper. And the next daye
he ſent with them a knyght of his of Tyntemache
a breton / to bring them the more ſurelyer

of whom there were many ſprede abrode. &
ſo long they rode that they came to Medenade
Campo / and there they founde the kynge
who had gret deſire to know what they wolde.
& whan they were a lyghted at their lodgyng
& chaūged & refreſhed thē they went to

were brought to hiby ye knightꝭ of his houſe
Than they delyuered to the kyng letters fro

but peſably to retourne in to their owne coutreis.
ſir / this is the deſyre and requeſt that

Firſt he deſyred ſir Water Paſſacke to

Sir ye are come to the ſame ende that we haue

of any nacyon what ſoeuer it be / that entred
in to this vyage: In any wyſe arme nat
them ſelfe for ye ſpace of ſixe yere agaynſt the
realme of Caſtyle / and that they ſwere thus
to do whan they take the ſafecōducte. And of
this cōpoſycion / ye ſhall haue letters open to
beare to your conſtable / and to ſuche cōpanyons
as ſent you hyder. Theſe knyghtꝭ thanked
the kynge and his counſayle of their anſwere
& ſayd. ſir there be certayne artycles in
your anſwere / we cā nat tell if they will be accepted
or nat. If they be nat / we ſhall ſende agayne
to you our heraulte / if he come nat we
ſhall accept your ſayeng. Well ſirs the kyng
is content (quod they of his counſayle) than
the kyng went in to his chambre. And ſir water
Paſſacke and ſir Wyllm̄ Lignacke kepte
ſtyll company with the Englyſſhe knyghtes
and brought them in to a fayre chābre / where
their dyner was redy apparelled for thē / and
there dyned with them. And after dyner had
wyne and ſpyces in the kynges chambre and
toke their leaue. Their letters were redy / &
they toke their horſes and ſo departed & rode
to Vyle cloppes / and the next day they came
to the towne of Arpent & dyned / and at night
lay at Noy in Galyce / and the next daye they
came to Auranche & there founde ye conſtable
So it fortuned that in this mean ſeaſon / one
of the duke of Lancaſters great barons died
a right valyant man / called the lorde Fitz water:
He was greatly bemooned / but agaynſt
dethe none maye ſtryue. His enterment was
honorably done / the kyng of Portugale and
the duke of Lācaſtre preſent. and whan theſe
thre knyghtes were come to the Dukes lodgyng / 
they ſhewed all that they had done / &
ſhewed their letters of confyrmacion of the
ſame. Than ſome ſayd it was a herde couenaunt / 
and ſome ſayde nay: holdyng opinyon
that it was right courteſſe / perfitely conſyderyng
the danger that they were in. Theſe tidynges
anone ſprede abrode in the hoſt / how
the duke had gyuen lycence euery man to departe
who ſo lyſt. Than ſuche as were ſycke
and feble / deſyring a freſſhe ayre / deꝑted as
ſoone as they might / & toke their leaue of the
duke and of the cōſtable / and than they were
truely payd their wagꝭ as curteſly as might
be. And ſome were content with fayre wordes / 
and ſo they departed by cōpanyes. ſome
went to Arpent / ſome to Ruelles / ſome to vilcloppes / 
ſome to Noy / ſōe to Medena de Cā
               po
& other places: & in euery place they were
welcome and brought to their lodgynges / &
their names preſented to the capitayne. The
greatteſt parte of the gentylmen went to Arpent / 
bycauſe in that towne there were many
ſtraungers / Bretons / frenchmen / normayns

and poicteuyns / ouer whome ſir Olyuer de
Cleſquyn was capitayne. The Englyſſhemen
truſted better in them than they dyde in
the Spaynyerdes / and good cauſe why.
            THus as I haue ſhewed you / the duke
of Lancaſtres army brake vp at that
tyme in Caſtyle / and euery man ſought the
beſt for hym ſelfe. ye maye well beleue that
this dyde greatly trouble the duke of Lancaſtre / 
and great cauſe why. for he ſawe his enterpriſe

                  •
               ore putte a backe and brought in to
a herde caſe / Howe be it lyke a valyaunt ſage
price as he was / he cōforted hym ſelfe aſwell
as he myght / for he ſawe well it coulde none
otherwyſe be. And whan the kyng of Portugale
ſawe howe the matter went / and yt their
army was broken of / He gaue lycence to all
maner of men / except a thre hundred ſpeares
that were come to ſerue hym. He retaygned
them ſtyll / and ſo departed fro Aurāche with
the duke of Lācaſtre and his wyfe / & rode to
ſaynt Iaques called Cōpoſtella. And whan
the kyng and the duke were there / the kynge
taryed there four dayes: And than departed
with all his men / and retourned to his countrey
to his wyfe / who laye at Porte / a good
cytie in Portugale.
            NOwe ſhall I ſhewe you what befell
of dyuers knyghtes and ſquyers / ſuche
as were departed fro the duke and gone
in to Caſtile. Dyuers that were entecte with
ſickeneſſe / for all their chaungynge of newe
ayre and newe medycins / yet they coulde nat
ſcape the peryll of dethe. Dyuers dyed in Arpent / 
in the meane ſeaſon that the king of Caſtyle
ſent to the kynge of Nauerre and to the
frenche kyng for their ſauecōductes / to paſſe
peſably (whiche was nat ſoone optaygned)
dyuers lordes / knyghtes / and ſquyers of Englāde
dyed in their beddes whiche was gret
domage / and a great loſſe to their countrey.
In Arpent there dyed thre great barones of
Englande / and ryche men. The firſt was ſir
Richarde Burle who had ben marſhall of ye
dukes hooſt / another the lorde Ponynges / &
the thyrde the lorde Percy / coſyn germayne
to the erle of Northumberlande. And in the
towne of Noy dyed ſir Mauberyn of Lymers
a poyteuyn / a ryght noble and an expert
knyght. And in the towne of Ruelles there
dyed a great baron called the lorde Talbot:
So that there died here and there a .xii. gret
lordes / and a fourſcore knightes / and two hū
               dred
ſquyers. This was a great dyſconfetture
without any ſtroke ſtryken / and there
dyed of other meane men / mo than fyue hundred.
And I herde it reported of a knyght of
Englande / as he retourned through Fraūce
(his name was ſir Thom̄s Quynbery) that
of fyftene hundred men of armes and foure
thouſande archers / that the duke of Lancaſtre
hadde brought out of the realme of Englande / 
there neuer returned agayn the halfe
parte.
            THe duke of Lancaſtre fyll in a perylous
ſickeneſſe in the towne of ſaynt
Iaques / and often tymes the brute
ranne in Caſtyle & in Fraunce howe he was
deed / and ſurely he was in a great aduēture
of his lyfe. Thyrrey of Souuayne a ſquyer
of honour / and ſquyer for ye dukes body was
taken with ſickeneſſe and dyed at Beſances / 
he was naturally borne of the countie of Heynaulte.
And his brother Wyllyam of Souuayn
was with hym tyll he dyed / who in like
wyſe was in great aduenture of his lyfe. Of
a trouthe there was none ſo hardy / ſo ryche / 
nor ſo tolye / but that they were in feare of thē
ſelfe / & euery day loked for none other thyng
but deth / and with this ſickeneſſe there were
none infected but alonely the duke of Lancaſters
cōpany. Among ye frēchmen there were
none ſicke / wherby dyuers murmuracyons
were among the ſpanyerdes / ſayeng / ye kyng
of Caſtyle hath done great grace to theſe Englyſſhmen
to ſuffre them to lye and reſt them
in his countie / and in his good townes / But
we feare it wyll coſt vs greatly / for they haue
or are lyke to bring in to this countrey great
mortalyte. Than other wolde ſaye: Ah / they
are chriſtenmen as we be / there ought cōpaſſion
and pyte to be taken one of another. this
was the cōmunyng among them: And true it
was / yt ſame ſeaſon a knyght of Fraūce dyed
in Caſtile for whom gret ſorowe was made:
For he was gracyous / courteſſe / and hardy
in armes / and was brother to ſir Iohan / ſir
Raynolde / and ſir Launcelotte of Voy / and
he was called ſir Iohn̄ of Voy / but howe he
dyed I ſhall tell you. He was in a towne of
Caſtyle / called Seghome / and laye there in
garyſon: he had an Impoſtume in his body / 

and he was yonge & luſty and tooke no hede
therof / but on a day lept on a great horſe and
rode out in to the feldes / & ſpurred his horſe / 
ſo that by gambaldyng of the horſe the impoſtume
brake in his body / and whan he was
retourned to his lodgynge he was layde on
his bedde ſicke / and that ſemed well / for the
fourthe daye after he dyed / wherof his frendes
were right ſoroufull.

by the king of Caſtyle / who
made hym good chere / and howe ſir

Cap. C.vi.
            
               YE maye well knowe that
euery man eſchewed this ſickeneſſe
that was amonge the Englyſſhmen / 
and fledde therfro aſmoche
as they myght. All this
ſeaſon ſir Iohan Holande the dukes conſtable
was ſtill with the duke / & certayne knightes
and ſquyers / ſeynge the ſeaſon of warre
paſte / thynkynge to eſchewe the peryll of the
ſickeneſſe / ſayd to the conſtable. Sir / let vs
retourne & we wyll go to Bayone or to Burdeux
to take freſſhe ayre / and to eſche we this
ſickenes / for whan ſo euer the duke of Lancaſtre
wyll haue vs agayne / lette hym write for
vs / and we ſhall ſoone be with hym / whiche
were better than to kepe vs here in daunger
and parell. They called ſo often on hym that
on a day he ſhewed the duke their murmuraryons.
Than the duke ſayde. Syr Iohan / I
wyll ye retourne and take my men with you / 
and recomende me to my lorde the kyng / and
to all my bretherne in Englande. With right
a good wyll ſir quod the conſtable. But ſyr / 
though ſycke men haue had great curteſy by
the conſtable of Caſtyle / as in ſuffering them
to entre to a byde there at their caſe tyll they
recouer their helthes / yet they maye nat retourne
agayne to you in to Caſtyle nor in to
Portugale. and if outher they or we take our
waye to Calays throughe Fraunce / than we
muſt be bounde to beare none armure in ſyxe
yere after againſt the realme of Fraūce / without
the kynge our ſouerayne lorde be preſent
in propre perſone. Than the duke ſayd. Syr
Iohan / ye knowe well that the frenchemen
will take on you and on our men (in caſe they
ſe them in daunger) all the vaūtage they can
do. Therfore I ſhall ſhewe you whiche way
ye ſhall paſſe curteſly through the realme of
Caſtyle. And whan ye come in to the entre of
Nauarre ſende to the kynge / he is my coſyn / 
and in tyme paſt we hadde great alyaunce to
guyder whiche are nat as yet broken / for ſith
the warre began bytwene ye kyng of Caſtyle
and me / we haue amiably written eche to other / 
as coſyns & frendes / nor no warre hath
ben made by ſee bitwene vs but the frēchmen
haue. wherfore I thynke he wyll lightly ſuffre
you to paſſe through his realme. & whan
ye be at ſaynt Iohan Pie de porte / than take
the waye to Biſquay and ſo to Bayon / than
ye be in our herytage: And fro thens ye may
go to the cytie of Burdeux without daunger
of the frenche men / and there refreſſhe you at
your eaſe. And whan ye haue wynde and weder
at wyll / than ye maye take the ſee & lande
in Cornwall or at Hampton / or there as the
wynde wyll ſerue you. Than ſir Iohan ſaid
your counſayle ſhalbe fulfylled without any
faute.
            IT was nat long after but that the Conſtable
and his company departed / and
there taryed with ye duke and duches / no mo
but his owne houſholde ſeruauntes. And ſir
Iohan Holande had his wyfe with hym and
ſo came to the cytie of Camores and there he
founde the kynge of Caſtyle / ſir Gaultier of
Paſſacke / and ſir Wyllm̄ of Lignacke / who
made hym good chere / as lordes and knyghtes
do whan they mete eche with other. And
truely the kyng of Caſtyle was gladde toſe
the departyng of the Englyſſhmen / for than
it ſemed to hym yt his warre was at an ende / 
and thought that there wolde neuer iſſue agayne
out of Englande ſo many good men
of warre / in the duke of Lancaſters tytell / to
make warre in Caſtyle. Alſo he knewe well

howe there was great trouble and dyſcorde
within the realme of Englande. Whan the tidynges
ſprede abrode in Caſtile / in the good
cyties and townes (where as the Englyſſhe
men lay ſicke and were there to ſeke for their
helthe) howe that ſir Iohan Hollande was

                  •
               ome thyder to retourne agayne in to Englā
               de.
They were ryght gladde therof / and ſo
drewe to hym / to the entent to retourne with
hym / As the lorde of Chameulx / ſir Thomas
Percy / the lorde Lelynton / the lorde of Braſeton / 
and dyuers other / to the nombre of a
thouſāde horſes. ſuche as were ſicke thought
them ſelfe halfe hole / whan they knewe they
ſhulde retourne / their voyage paſte was ſo
paynfull to them.
            WHan ſir Iohan Hollande toke leaue
of ye kyng of Caſtyle / the kyng gaue
to hym and to his cōpany great giftes / 
with mules and mulettes of Spaygne / 
and payde for all their coſtes. And than they
rode to ſaynt Phagons and there refreſſhed
thē thre dayes / and in euery place they were
welcome and well receyued / For there were
knyghtes of the kynges that dyde conducte
theym / and payde alwayes for their coſtes.
So longe / they code that they paſſed Spaygne
and came to Naueret / where as the batayle
had ben before / and ſo to Pauyers and
to Groyne / and there reſted. for as than they
were nat in certayne if the kynge of Nauerre
wolde ſuffre them to paſſe throughe his realme
or nat. Than they ſent to hym .ii. knightes / 
ſir Peter Byſſet and ſir Wylliam Norwiche.
They founde the kynge at Tudela in
Nauer / and there ſpake with hym / & ſpedde
ſo well / that they had graūt to paſſe through
Nauer / payeng for that they ſhulde take by
the way: and as ſoone as theſe knyghtꝭ were
retourned / they departed fro Groyne and ſo
came to Pampylona & paſſed the mountains
of Roūceaux / and lefte the way in to Bierne / 
and entred in to Biſquay ſo to go to Bayon / 
at laſt thyder they came / and there ſir Iohan
Holande taryed a long ſpace with his wyfe / 
and other of the Englyſſhmen rode to Burdeaux.
Thus this armye brake vp.
            So it was / in the ſeaſon whyle theſe warres
endured in Caſtile / & that yt engliſſhmen
kepte the feldes. The lorde Bouciqualt the
elder of the .ii. bretherne ſent by an herault to
ſir Iohan Dābreticourt / deſyring to do with
hym dedes of armes: as thre courſes with a

                  〈◊〉
               /thre with an axe / and thre with a dagger
all or 
                  〈…〉
                the knight was agreed
therto. And after that ſir Iohan Dambreticourt
ſent dyuers tymes to accōplyſſhe their
feate / but Bouciqualt came nat forwarde / I
can not tell what was ye cauſe / nor I wyll nat
ſay but that he was a tight good knight / and
mete to haue done a greatter feate in armes
than that was. And whan ſir Iohan Dābreticourt
was come to Bayone in the company
of ſir Iohan Holāde / he was in dyuers ymaginacions
on his chalēge / and thought that
honorably he might nat departe out of thoſe
partes (ſeyng he was chalenged to do dedes
of armes / & had graunted therto) without he
fulfylled the ſame / for if he returned in to England
wtout doyng of any thyng / he thought
that the frenchmen wolde ſaye that he deꝑted
for feare. Than he toke coūſayle of ſir Iohn̄
Holāde and of other / what were beſt for him
to do. He was counſayled to take the waye
through Fraūce / with the ſafeconducte yt the
duke of Burbon had gotte hym / & ſo to go to
Parys / and there to demaunde for ſir Bouciqualt
or els by the way / therby at leſt his honour
ſhulde be excuſed. This counſayle the
knight beleued & folowed the ſame / and ſo deꝑted
fro Bayon and entred in to Biern / & ſo
came to Artoys & there founde therle of Foiz
who made hym good chere / & at his deꝑtyng
the erle gaue hym .ii.C. Florens and a good
horſe. Than he rode forthe through Byern &
entred in to the coūtre of Bigore and ſo in to
Tholouſin & in to Carcaſſynois / and in his
cōpany was Wylliam of Souuayne & other
ſquiers of Heynault / retournyng in to their
countreis. So longe he rode that he came to
Parys / & at that tyme the kyng was in Normandy / 
and ſir Boucikalt as it was ſhewed
hym was in Aragon. Than ſir Iohn̄ Dambreticourt
to acquyte his enterprice / preſēted
hym ſelfe before certayne of the great barons
of Fraunce beyng at Parys / and ſhewed thē
howe he was come thyder to acquite hymſelf
of his chalenge. And whan he hadde taryed
there .viii. dayes he deꝑted & came to Calais
and they of Heynault in to their owne countreis.
Thus lytell and litell the army yt went
into Spayne and into Portugale brake vp.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe the duke of Burbone deꝑted
fro Auygnon to go in to Caſtyle
with all his hoſt / and came to Burgus
in Spayne / and there foūde the
kyng of Caſtyle: and howe the duke
of Lancaſtre herde thoſe tidynges: &
howe the duke of Burbone departed
fro the kyng / and went ſtreyght
agayne in to Fraunce. Cap .C.vii.
            
               IT ought to be ſuppoſed / 
that the duke Loys of
Burbon (who was at the
begynnyng of this enterpriſe
and armye / in to Caſtyle / 
ordaynedde to be as
chefe) was well enformed
howe the maters went. If he had knowen yt
it ſhuld haue ben ſo / he wolde haue made the
more haſte / for it was long or he entred in to
Spaygne / for he toke a longe waye by Auignon
to ſe hym that wrote hymſelf pope Clement / 
and there taryed a long ſpace / & whan
he departed he rode to Mountpelyer & there
taryed a fyue dayes / and alſo at Beſyers &
Carcaſſone / Narbone and Parpinyon / and
than entred in to the realme of Aragon / toſe
the yonge kynge there and his coſyn ye quene
yolant of Bare / and ſo rode to Baſelona and
there founde the kyng and the quene his coſyn / 
and a great nombre of the lordes of the
countrey that were come thyder to ſeſt hym / 
and ſo they dyde. and whan he had ben there
a ſixe dayes he went to Valēcenſia the great
and there he herde ſure tidynges howe ye Englyſſhe
armye was withdrawen and paſſed
homewarde / and howe that ſir Iohan Hollande
was in Nauer goyng hōwarde / with
a great parte of his cōpany / and howe there
had ben a great dethe among them. And alſo
he herde howe his coſyn the duke of Lancaſtre
laye ſicke in Compoſtella in Galyce:
and in dyuers places it was ſayde / howe he
was deed. Howe be it though there were as
thanne but lytell to do in Spaygne / yet he
thought to paſſe further and ſende worde of
his comyng to the kyng of Caſtile who was
ryght gladde therof and to mete with hym / 
came to Burgus in Spayne / and there prouyded
greatly for his receyuynge / & ſuche as
were there with hym of Fraūce / were ryght
gladde to ſe the duke of Burbone. Thus the
duke paſſed Valencenſia and Saragoſa &
all the portes / and entred in to Spayne and
came to Burgus / and there he was well receyued / 
& there was ſir Olyuer of Cleſquyn
conſtable of Caſtyle and ſir Wylliam of Lignacke / 
ſir Gaultier of Paſſacke / ſir Iohan
of Barres / ſir Iohan & ſir Raynolde of Roy
and dyuers other knyghtes of Fraunce / who
lefte their garyſons to come and ſe the duke
of Burbone / for there was as than no doute
of the Englyſſhmen nor of the portugalois / 
for they were all withdrawen. And the Englyſſhmen
forſoke their garyſons that they
had won in Galyce / for they knewe well they
coude nat reſyſt the army of Fraunce / ſeyng
their compaignyons were departed dyuers
wayes / as ye haue herde before.
            TIdinges came in to Galyce howe the
duke of Burbon was cōe in to Spaigne / 
and had brought with hym great nōbre
of knyghtes of Fraūce / brute and noyſe was
more thanne it was in dede / by the one halfe,
The cōmons were in great dout / that ye duke
of Burbon wolde haue entred there wt great
force and puiſſaunce / but that the duke of Lā
               caſtre
was there amonge them / who greatly
conforted them. Tidynges came to the duke
of Lancaſtre / howe that his coſyn the duke of
Burbone was come in to Spayne / and was
at Burgus with the kynge / and incontynent
he ſent worde therof to the kynge of Portugale / 
deſyring hym to gather agayne toguyder
his people / for he knewe nat what ye frenche
men wolde do / ſeyng the Englyſſhe men
were auoyded the coūtrey. The kyng of Portugale / 
by reaſon of ſuche alyaunce as was
bytwene them he conſented / and departed fro
Lirbone and came to Conymbres / and there
made his ſōmons through out his realme / euery
man to be redy. And than he came to the
cytie of Porte to drawe nere to the countrey
of Galyce / and to his father in lawe the duke
of Lancaſtre / who was nat as than in good
poynte to ryde / for the ſickeneſſe that he had / 
howe beit he began to amende. Nowe let vs
ſpeke of the duke of Burbon / who was with
the kyng of Caſtyle / who made hym as good
chere as he coude / and all other prelates and

lordes of the realme. And many counſayles
there was bytwene them / to determyne what
they ſhulde do / outher to ryde in to Galyce or
els to returne. The kyng of Caſtyle and they
of his counſayle ſawe clerely / howe the mater
ſhulde beſte be for their profyte / and ſayd eche
to other whan they were togyder. By reaſon
of theſe frenchmen our landes are waſted and
dyſtroyed / though they be come to kepe it / we
haue taken by them great domage? wherfore
we thinke it ſhulde be good / to thāke the duke
of Borbon for the payne and trauayle that he
hathe endured in cominge hyder. and lette vs
deſyre hym louyngly to with drawe his men
of warre / ſeynge henedeth nat to tary here for
any warre that is apatente (for as for Galice)
the recouery therof ſhall be but a ſmall mater
for vs. Thus they of the kynges counſayle comuned
eche with other / and further they ſaid.
If we ones receyue theſe people they muſt be
payed of their wages / if nat / they will pyll and
robbe all the realme / for the comon people all
redy begynneth to complayne: & therfore we
thynke it were beſt to gyue thē an honeſt congy
to departe. This counſayle was vpholden
and the kynge well conſented there to / for he
ſawe well it was the moſt proftye for his people
and realme / for they coulde take no hurte
but it ſhulde be to his domage and preiudice.
So that one daye in the kynges preſence the
archebyſſhop of Burgus to the duke of Burbon / 
& before many of the knightes of Fraunce
ſhewed and declared to theym their ententes / 
as ye haue herde before. And the duke of Burbon
and dyuers other knyghtes of Fraunce / 
who had rather retourne than to a byde there
for the countrey was nat mete for their complerions)
were well contente to retourne / and
prepared themſelfe thervpon. and bycauſe the
duke of Burbone was laſte that came / he retourned
firſt / and toke his leaue of the kynge / 
and ſaid howe he wolde returne by the realme
of Nauerre. There were great gyftes gyuen
him or he departed / and might haue had more
if he wolde haue taken it / but he refuſed euery
thynge / except mules and mul
                  •
               tte
                  •
               /and dogges
of Spayne. Than it was publiſſhed that
all frenchmen might at their pleaſure departe
out of Spayne / and retourne in to Fraunce.
but there taryed ſtyll ſir Olyuer of Cleſquyn
conſtable of Spayne and the marſhals / and
a thre hundred ſpeares of bretons / poicteuyns
and xayngtons. Thus the duke of Burbone
returned. Whan he had taken his congy of the
kynge and the quene / and of other lordes of
Caſtyle / he was conueyed to Groyne / and ſo
in to Nauarre. And where ſo euer he came he
was welcome and well receyued. for the duke
of Burbone was gracyous / curteyſe / honorable / 
and well renomed. And the kynge of Nauer
receyued him louyngly / and neuer ſhewed
any maner of yuell wyll towardes the frenche
kynge / in that he had taken a way fro him his
enherytaūce of the countye of Eureur in Normandy / 
for he ſawe well the frenche kyng that
was as than nephewe to the duke of Burbon / 
was in no defaute therof / for whā it was done
he was but yonge. But ſwetely he ſhewed the
duke all his buſyneſſe / deſyringe hym to be a
good meane bytwene hym and his coſyn the
frenche kynge. The duke promyſed hym ſo to
be. Than the duke departed / and paſſed thorough
the realme of Nauer peaſably / and all
other ſuche as wolde paſſe. and thus they paſſed
the mountayns of Rouſeaulx / & all alonge
the countrey of Baſtelles / and ſo entred in to
Bierne and in to Saluaterra.
         
         
            ¶Howe therle of Foize receyued honourably
the duke of Burbon / and
of the great giftes that he gaue him / 
and how ſir willyam of Lygnac and
ſir Gaultier of Paſſackes cōpany departed
out of Spayne / and of the incydent
that fortuned in the towne of
ſaynt Phagon. Cap. C.viii.
            
               WHan the Erle of Foyz
beynge at Ortays / vnderſtode
that the duke of Burbon
was at Saluaterra he
was glad therof / and ſente
for his knightꝭ to be aboute
him. And on a day in great
araye he rode with a fyue hundred knyghtes
and ſquyers two leages out of Ortays / and
mette with the duke of Burbon / who in lykewyſe
rode with a great rout of knyghtes and
ſquiers / and there they met amyably / as great
prynces ought to do. And whan they had comuned
togyther a certayne ſpace (as it was

ſhewed me) whan I was at Ortays. The erle
of Foize drewe hym a parte in the felde with
all his company / and the duke abode ſtyll in a
nother parte. Than the Erle ſente to the duke
thre knyghtes named ſyr Eſpayne de Lyon / 
ſir Peter Capeſtan / and ſir Menaunt of Nowalles.
And whan they came before the duke
they ſayd. Sir / here is a preſent that my lorde
the erle of Foiz hath ſent / to you at your returnynge
out of Spayne / for he knoweth well ye
haue been at great dyſpence / Therfore ſyr he
dothe gyue you at your entring in to his countrey
of Bierne / eyght thouſande frankes / and
this mulette / and two courſers and two palfreys.
Syrs quod the duke / I thanke the erle
of Foyze / But as for the floreyns I wyll take
none / as for the other preſente I wyll receyue
them with a good wyll. thus the florens were
refuſed / and the Mules and horſes receyued.
Than the erle of Foyz came to the duke / and
brought hym in to the towne of Ortays / and
lodged him in his owne place / & all other were
lodged in the towne. the duke was thre dayes
in Ortays / and had great there with dyners
and ſuppers. And there the Erle of Foize ſhewed
ye duke a great parte of his eſtate. On the
fourthe daye the duke departed / and the erle
gaue to ye knightes and ſquiers great gyftes.
As it was ſhewed me / the comynge thyder of
the duke of Burbon coſte the erle of Foize ten
thouſande frankes. Thus the duke departed
and went in to Fraunce / and rode by Mountpelyer
& by the cytie of Puy / and by the countye
of Foreſtes wherof he was lorde by the lady
his wyfe.
            FOr all the departyng of ye duke of Burben
(as ye haue herde) out of Spayne / 
ſir Willyam Lignac and ſir Gaultier of Paſſac
departed nat ſo ſoone / nor the companyes
to the nombre of a thre thouſande ſpeares and
ſyre thouſande of other men of warre / and lytell
and lytell euer they departed. They were
many out of wages and wery of the warres / 
and ſo retourned yuell horſed and yuell aparelled / 
all to torne and ragged. The metynge
with ſuche people was nothynge profytable / 
for they vnhorſed whome ſoeuer they met / and
made warre to all marchaūtes and to men of
the churche / and to poore people of the countre
where any thinge was to gette. Theſe rutters
ſayde howe the warre had vndone them / and
howe the kynge of Caſtyle hadde yuell payed
theym their wages / wherfore they ſayde they
wolde pay themſelfe. And ſurely ſuche cyties / 
caſtels / and good townes as were nat ſtronge
in Caſtyle / douted them greatly. and agaynſt
them townes and cyties cloſed their gates for
feare of parels / for all was hauocke with them
without it were well defended. Suche knightes
and ſquyers as came by the erle of Foyze
to ſe hym were well receyued / and had gyftes
and rewardes gyuen them ryght largely. As
it was ſhewed / the comyng and retournynge
of men of warre / that paſſed by therle of Foize
for the ſayd iourney / coſte hym the ſome of .xl.
thouſande frankes.
            THis ſeaſon there fell an incydent in the
towne of ſaynt Phagon in Spaygne
after the departynge of the duke of Burbone / 
the whiche coſte fyue hundred mennes lyues.
So it was that whan ſir Gaultier of Paſſar
and ſir Willyam of Lignac entred firſte in to
Spayne / their companyes ſpredde abrode in
to dyuerſe places in the countrey / and aboute
the towne of ſaynte Phagon / whiche was a
good plentuous countrey. There were many
of the bretons / poicteuyns / and augenyns / of
rainton and men of the lowe countreys. And
whan they entred fyrſte in to ſaynt Phagon / 
they entred by ſyxe / ten / fyftene and twenty / ſo
that at laſte there were mo than fyue hundred
of one and other / mayſters and ſeruauntes / 
and euer as they came they lodged them ſelfe / 
and pilled and robbed their hoſtes / and brake
vp cofers & cupbordes / and wolde take what
they foūde. And whan the citezyns ſawe their
demeanoure / to the entent that there ſhulde no
mo entre. whan theſe ſtraungers were at their
reſte they cryed alarum in the towne / and the
ſpanyardes were redy for the ſame all the day
before. And ſo they entred in to the lodginges
where the ſtraungers were / and as they were
founde they were ſlayne without pytie or mercye / 
and happy were they that were ſaued. the
ſame nyght there were ſlayne mo thanne fyue
hundred. The nexte mornyng theſe tydinges
came to the capytayns that were comynge to
the ſame towne warde. than they drewe them
togyder to take counſayle / And the capitayns
determyned that it was no tyme than to be reuenged.
for if they dyde / they ſhulde fynde all
other townes and cyties againſt them / wherof

their enemyes wold/be right ioyous / but they
ſayde that whan their voyage ſhulde haue an
ende / yt in their retourning they wolde thanke
them accordynge to their deſertes. So they
paſſed forwarde and ſpake nothynge therof / 
but they thought the more.
            NOwe than ſo it happend that whan euery
man returned / except ſuche as were
ſtyll abydinge with the conſtable ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon / and ſpecially thoſe of ye lowe countreys / 
whan they came togyder they ſayd eche
to other. Nowe lette vs paye for our welcome
that we had at ſaynt Phagon? Lette vs quyte
them at our departyng. To this they were all
agreed / and ſo gathered togyder to the ſōme
of a thouſande fightynge men / and they aproched
ſaynt Phagon / & entred in to the towne
(without any myſtruſte that they of the cytie
had to them / for they truſted all thynges had
ben forgoten) The ſtraungers cryed alarum
in a hūdred places / and cryed ſlee the villayns
of the towne / and take all that they haue / for
they haue well deſerued it. Thanne theſe bretons
and other entred in to the howſes where
they thought to wyn moſte / and brake vp cofers / 
and ſlewe the mē downe in euery place.
They ſlewe the ſame day mo than foure hundred / 
and the towne robbed and ſpoyled / and
more than halfe brente / whiche was great domage.
Thus theſe rutters were reuenged for
the dethe of their companyons / and than they
departed fro ſaynte Phagon.
         
         
            ¶Howe the kyng of Caſtell and his
counſayle were yuell contente with
ſir Willyam of Lignac and ſyr Gaultier
of Paſſackes cōpany / and howe
the duke of Lancaſtre departed fro
ſaynt Iaques to Bayon. Cap. C.ix.
            
               TIdynges came to the
king of Caſtyle howe theſe
companyons had robbed
and pylled the good towne
of ſaynt Phagon / & ſlayne
the cytezyns to the nobre
of a four hūdred / and nigh
brent the towne. And it was ſayd that if the englyſſhe
men had wonne it with aſſaute / they
wolde nat haue daulte ſo cruelly as they dyd.
The ſame tyme the two knyghtes were preſent
with the kynge / and they were greatly reproued
by the kyng and his counſayle. They
excuſed them and ſayd: as god might be their
helpes they knewe nothynge therof. but they
ſayd / they had herde howe they were nat contente
with them of that towne / bycauſe whan
they entred firſte in to the realme and came to
ſaynte Phagon / there were certayne of their
company ſlayne / which grudge by lyklyhode
they haue borne euer ſythe in their hertes. It
behoued the kyng of Caſtyle to let this mater
paſſe / for it wolde haue coſte hym ouer moche
to haue hadde it amended. But he bare nat ſo
good wyll to the capytayns after / as he dyd before / 
and that was well ſene. for whan they departed
and toke leaue of the kyng to retourne
in to Fraūce / if he had ben pleaſed with them / 
it ought to be ſuppoſed they ſhulde haue been
better payed of their wages than they were.
For the duke of Burbone that came laſte and
was firſte that departed / he and his company
had all the chere / and well rewarded. Thus
theſe people iſſued out of Caſtyle by dyuerſe
wayes / ſome by Biſquay & ſome by Aragon.
Suche as were noble and honeſte knyghtes
and ſquyers / and lyued well and kepte good
rule / they departed pore and yuell horſed. and
ſuche as were hardy and aduentured to robbe
and pylle / they were well horſed and well furniſſhed
with gold and ſyluer / and their males
full of baggage. Thus it falleth in ſuche aduentures / 
ſome wyn and ſome leſe. The kyng
of Caſtyle was ioyfull whan he ſawe he was
clene delyuered of ſuche people.
            NOwe let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of the duke
of Lancaſtre / who laye ſicke in his bed
in the towne of ſaynt Iames / and the duches
his wyfe with hym and his doughter Katheryn.
It is to be thought that the duke day and
nyght was nat without anoyaūce / for he ſawe
his buſynes in a harde parte / and many of his
good knyghtes deed / ſuche as he with moche
payne had brought with him out of Englāde.
Nor there was none that wolde treate for any
compoſicyon to be had bytwene hym and the
kynge of Caſtyle / nor that he wolde take the
duches his wyfe for enheritour of Caſtell / nor
gyue her any parte there of. But he herde his

men ſaye / that they were enfourmed by pylgrymes
that came to ſaynt Iaques / oute of
Flaunders / Brabant / Heynaulte / and other
countreis / as they came throughe the realme
of Spaygne: They herde the men of warre
ſaye to them. Sirs ye ſhall go to ſaynt Iaques
and there ye ſhall fynde the duke of Lā
               caſtre / 
who kepeth his chambre for feare of ye
lyght of the ſonne. Recōmaunde vs to hym
and demaunde of hym in oure behalfe if we
haue made hym fayre warre / or that he be cō
               tent
with vs or nat. The Engliſſhmen were
wont to ſay that we coude better daūce than
make warre. But nowe is ye tyme come that
they reſt and ſynge / and we kepe the feldes / 
and our fronters / in ſuche wyſe that we leſe
nothing nor take any domage. Suche tales
were tolde to the duke & he toke all in worthe
for he had none other remedy. And as ſoone
as he myght ryde he departed / and ye duches
and his doughter fro ſaynt Iaques / For the
kyng of Portugale had ſente for hym by the
erle of Noware his conſtable with a fyue hū
               dred
ſpeares / and with hym ſir Iohn̄ Ferant
the Ponaſe of Congue / Ageas Coylle / Venaſe
Martyn de Malo / Galope Ferrant / ſir
Aulde Perre / I can Nedighes de Fay / Gannes
de Falues / all barons. Thus they departed
fro Compoſtella / & ſo rode tyll they came
to the cytie of Porte. There the kynge & the
quene of Portugale made them good chere.
And anone after the kyng and the quene deꝑted
and wente to Conymbres / a dayes iourney
fro thens / and the duke taryed there a.ii.
monethes. In the meane ſeaſon he ordayned
for all his buſyneſſe and hadde galyes of the
kyng / and they were apparelled / & had with
hym the mayſter patrone of Portungale / named
Alphons Brecart. And whan they ſawe
good tyme to take the ſee / ye duke and all his
entred in to their veſſelles / and diſacred and
toke the ſee / & were within a day and a halfe
of Bayon whiche was more than threſcore
and.

               dynge
and founde nat there ſir Iohan Hollande
nor the other Englyſſhe men / for they
were departed and gone to Burdeux / & there
toke ſhippyng and ſo in to Englande. The
duke taryed at Bayon a longe ſpace / and lyued
there of the reuenewes of Bayon & Burdeux
and of the lande of Acquitayne / of all
that was vnder the obeyſaunce of kyng Richarde
of Englande / for he had commiſſyon
ſuffycient to receyue the profytes of all thoſe
landes / and was called duke and gouernour
of them. ¶Nowe lette vs leaue to ſpeke a

            ¶Howe the erle of Armynake toke
great payne to treate with the cōpanyons / 
to departe out of the realme
of Fraunce. Cap. C.x.
            
               IN this reaſon the erle of Armynake
was in Auuergne / & was
intreatyng of the companyons
ſuche as laye in fortreſſes in garyſon.
In Auuergne / Querſy / &
Lymoſen. This erle hadde great deſyre to
cauſe theſe capitayns to departe out of the realme
of Fraunce / and to leaue ſuche holdes
as they were in / for theſe lādes were ſore oppreſſed
by them and greatly impoueriſſhed.
And ſo he was in cōmunycacion with them
all / except Geffray Teate Noyre / who helde
Wenchadore agaynſt the erle of Armynake.
Theſe ſayd capitayns ſhulde receyue at one
payment / two hundred and .l. thouſande frā
               kes.
And to paye this ſōme the ſayde landes
were bounde / for they were glad to be delyuered
of theſe people / for otherwiſe they coude
nat labour the erthe / nor occupy their feate of
marchaundiſe / nor do any thyng for feare of
theſe pyllers / without they were pateſed by
them. And ye charge of their pateſyng drewe
well yerely to the ſōme that they ſhulde pay
to haue them delyuered. And thoughe theſe
countreis had warre with the Englyſſhmen
yet there were amonge them but fewe of the
nacyon of Englande: But there were Gaſcoyns / 
bretons / almayns / foyzons / and men
of dyuers countreis / who were gathered toguyder
to do yuell dedes. And whan the cō
               poſycions
of the redempcion was made and
agreed: they excepted Geffray Teate noyre
and his forterers / for he wolde do nothynge
for them. Than the erle of Armynake prayed
the erle Dolphyn of Auuergne / who was a
great capitayne / that he ſhulde treate with ye
               
ſayd Geffray / and that he wolde do ſo moche
to go in to Fraunce to the kyng and his coū
               ſayle / 
the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyn / 
who as than had the gouernyng of ye realme
to haue their counſayle and aſſyſtence. For
without their aduyſe & agrement / they durſt
reyſe vp no tayle in the countrey. The Erle
Dolphyn of Auuergne at the requeſt of the
erle of Armynake toke his iourney to Paris
as than the kynge was nat there / he was at
Roane. Thyder rode the erle / and there ſhewed
all the mater to the kynge and his counſayle / 
but he was nat ſhortely diſpatched / for
they douted the treatie of theſe people / & ſaid
Sir erle Dolphyn / we knowe well that the
erle of Armynake and you wolde right gladlye
the honour and profyte of the realme / for
your partes lyeth therin. ye haue fayre landes
there / But we doute greatly / that whan
theſe capitayns gaſcoyns / bernoyes / & other
be payed ſuche ſomes of money as the compoſicyon
requyreth / wherby the countre ſhulde
be enpoueriſſhed / yt than within thre or four
monethes after they ſhulde retourne againe
and make worſe warre than they dyd before / 
and entre agayne in to theſe fortreſſes. than
the erle of Dolphyn anſwered and ſayd. ſirs
it is our ententes / the tayle ceſſed and gadered / 
that the money ſhall nat paſſe out of Cleremonde
or Ryon / tyll we be certifyed and in
ſuretie of theſe people. Well quod the dukes
we are content that the money be leuyed and
put in ſure kepyng in ſome place in the ſame
countre / for at the leeſt it ſhall ſerue to make
them warre / if they wyll nat come to ſome amyable
treatie. And that the erle of Armynake
and you / the byſſhoppe of Cleremonde
and the biſſhoppe of Puy / take ye the charge
of this mater / and do ſo as it may be for your
honour / and profite to the coūtre. With right
a good wyll ſir quod the erle / and ſo deꝑted
fro the kyng and his vncles fro Roane / and
founde the erle of Armynake his brother at
Cleremont in Auuergne / with many lordes
of the countre taryenge there vpon his commyng.
and there he ſhewed worde for worde
that he had with the frēche kyng and his vncles / 
and the doutes that were made in ye mater:
And howe it was their ententes that the
tayle ſhulde be gadered / and the money ther
of gadered toguyder and putte in ſuretie in
ſome certayne place / tyll the very entente of
theſe pyllers might be knowen / who kepeth
caſtels and gariſons agaynſt the realme. the
ſame is our entencion quod the erle of Armynake / 
and ſithe it pleaſeth the kynge and his
counſayle we ſhall go further in the mater:
but for the more ſuretie it muſt behoue vs to
haue a good and a ſure truſe with thē for all
the countrey / tyll the tayle be ceſſed and gadered.
Than there were ambaſſadours aſſigned
by the erle of Armynake to go and ſpeke
with Perot le Bernoys and Amergot Marcell.
Theſe two were as ſouerayns of the fortreſſe
that they helde on that ſyde the ryuer of
Durdone / and alſo to ſpeke with the Borge
of Compaigne / with Bernarde of ye Iſles / 
with Olyuer Barbe abton / with Seghewe
the lorde of Laenplayre / and dyuers other.
All theſe capitayns acorded nat togyder / for
that the one wolde ye other wolde nat. I ſhal
ſhewe you the reaſon why.
            THey were of dyuers opinyons and
of dyuers countreis. They of Armynake / 
ſuche as were vnder the
obeyſaunce of the Erle of Armynake were
ſoone agreed / but all the other wolde nat be
ruled by hym. for the chefe company of them
and ſuche as were moſt renomed to vſe grete
robbery and pillery were of Bierne / and of
the countie of Foiz. Howbeit I ſaye nat but
that the erle of Foiz wolde the honour of the
realme of Fraunce. But whan he herde firſt
howe the erle of Armynake dyde treate with
them / for ſuche fortreſſes as they helde in Auuergne / 
in Quercy / and in Lymoſyn: as he
that deſyred to knowe the hole ſubſtaūce of
the mater. Demaunded of them that enfourmed
hym therof / what the erle of Armynake
was mynded to do with ye men that were in
the garyſons / whan they were departed out
of their holdes / and whyder he wolde ſet thē
in any buſyneſſe or nat. Than he was anſwered / 
and it was ſaid to hym. Sir / the erle of
Armynake wolde kepe them in wages & occupy
them in to Lombardy: for as ye knowe
well his ſuſter is maryed there / and before
ſhe had Gaſcone your ſon̄e / for it is thought
there ſhalbe moche a do in Lombardy. whervnto
the erle of Foiz gaue none anſwere but
fell in to other talkyng / howbe it he thought
neuertheleſſe (as it apered af
                  •
               ) for he hādled
the mater couertly. I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            
               
The erle of Armynake for any treatie that
he coude do to them that were of the countre
of Bierne / or of the teneurs of therle of Foiz
or ſuche as owed hym any fauour / coude neuer
cauſe any of them to agree to departe out
of their gariſons. Nor wolde nat go nother
to the erle of Armynake nor to Bernarde his
brother in lawe. For therle of Foiz who was
full of great prudence / conſydred that theſe
two lordes of Armynake & there coſyns / and
with the labriciens were puiſſaunt men. and
ſawe howe they gate them frendes on euery
parte / he thought they ſhulde nat be renforſed / 
with them that ought to ſerue hym. And
one thynge that was reaſonable the Erle of
Foiz ymagined. ſir Eſpaygne de Leon ſhewed
it me whan I was at Ortays / & in lykewiſe
ſo dyde the erle of Compane / capitayne
of Carlot in Auuergne: and alſo ſo dyde the
Bourge of Englande. They ſayd howe the
erle of Foiz regarded howe he had had open
warre with them of Armynake / thoughe it
were peace bytwene them (as than) whiche
was but a trueſe / the whiche was dyuers tymes
renewed bytwene theym. Therfore he
thought 
                  •
               hat if the erle of Armynake had all
thoſe companyons vnder his gouernaunce / 
his warres ſhulde be the fayrer. So that the
armynakes and the labricience with their alyes / 
myght do hym a great diſpleaſure.
            This was the cauſe that ſuche as owed fauour
to therle of Foiz / wolde nat agte to the
erle of Armynake. Howe be it they made thē
beleue that they wolde / but they dyd but diſſemble / 
for they brake all their apoyntmētes.
howe be it they rode nat abrode ſo moche as
they dyde before / Wherby alwayes the Erle
of Armynake thought to haue come to his
purpoſe. They that agreed to hym were Perotte
de Bernoys / who helde the ſtronge caſtell
of Salucette / whiche is chefe and ſoueraygne
of all Auuergne and Lymoſyne / for
their pateſyng endured to Rochell. And alſo
Guyllyam of ſaynt Foye / who helde the caſtell
of Bonteuyll / and alſo Margote Marcell / 
who helde Loyſſe before ſaynt Flour in
Auuergne / and the Bourge of Compaygne
and the Englyſſhe Bourge / who helde Carlotte.
Margote Marcell ſayde he was contente / 
ſo that he myght haue in lykewiſe Perotte / 
Bernoys / and Geffray Teate Noyre / 
who helde Vādachore / who was ſouerayne
aboue all other. But he dyde but mocke and
diſſemble the mater / for he diſdayned to fall
to any treatie of the erle of Armynakes / or of
any other. For he thought his caſtell imprignable
and well prouyded for ſeuyn or eyght
yeres / for he had a paſſage or two that coude
nat be taken fro hym / but that he myght iſſue
whan he lyſte / to refreſſhe hym ſelfe and his
company. This Geffray wrote hym ſelfe in
his ſaueconductes. Geffray Teate Noyre
duke of Vandachore / erle of Lymoſyn / lorde
and ſoueraygne of all the capitayns of Auuergne / 
Rouergue / and Lymoſyn.
            
               NOw let vs leaue to ſpeke of theſe maters
of farre coūtreis / tyll we haue
cauſe to returne therto agayne: And
nowe I wyll ſpeke of matters nerer home / 
as of myne owne nacyon (as it hath ben ſhewed
here before) whan I treated of the ende
of the warre of Flaunders / and of the charter
of peace that the duke of Burgoyne / and
the ducheſſe dyde gyue and graunt / and ſealed
to them of Gaunt / in the good towne and
noble cytie of Tourney. Therfore nowe to
enforce our mater and hiſtory / we wyll ſpeke
nowe of the warres of Guerles and of Brabant.
And I am quickened ſo to do / bycauſe
that the Frenche kyng and the duke of Burgoyne
(to whom the mater greatly touched / 
by the inſydentes that gendred therby) were
fayne to ſet to their hādes to the ſame warre / 
and to come to the bottom therof: And to contynue
at length the true hyſtorie and mater / 
I ſaye thus as foloweth.

               ALonge ſeaſon it was
that they of Guerles and
they of Brabant had grete
hatered toguyder / and ſo
dyd the countreis to them
adioyninge / by reaſon of
certayne bondes one agaynſt
another. And the mooſt hatered that the
brabanders had to the duke of Guerles and
to his heyres / was for the towne of Graue / 
whiche the dukes of Guerles had holden per
force a longe ſeaſon agaynſt the brabanſoys.
For they ſayd / bycauſe yt the towne of grane
ſtode on that ſyde of the ryuer of Mueſe towardes
Brabant / that the duke of Guerles
helde it wrongfully. & before yt tyme dyuers
cōmunycacions had been and poyntmentes
taken / howbeit alwayes the guerloys ſtacke
in their hertꝭ. Alſo ye guerloys hated the brabāſoys / 
bycauſe of thre fayre caſtels yt were
on that ſyde the ryuer / as Gaulech / Buthe / &
Nulle. Whiche caſtelles the duke of Brabāt
helde alſo peforce: And by reaſone (as in redynge
I ſhall begynne at the duke of Guerles)
Theſe hatereddes were often tymes renewed
bytwene them of Guerles and Brabant.
And it was ſuppoſed by dyuers knightes
and ſquyers that knewe of their dedes of
armes / that if ſir Edwarde of Guerles who
was ſlayne by a marueylous incydent at the
batayle of Iulyers / by ye ſhote of an archer
that was with the duke Vyncelant of Boem
duke of Luſenbourge or of Brabante / If he
had lyued (with that that his men had had
the vyctorie) he hadde come to his entente in
gettyng agayne the thre caſtelles. for he was
lo valiant a man and ſo hardy / that he wolde
haue conquered them agayne. ¶Nowe I
wyll declare (as I haue promyſed) how and
in what maner theſe foreſayd caſtelles came
in to the ſignorie of the brabanſoys / and firſt
I wyll begyn with the dukes of Guerles.
            IN the tyme whan I wrote and ordayned
this hyſtorie / there was an Erle of
Guerles / called Raynolde / and bycauſe that
Guerles is no riche countre / nor ſo great as
the duchy of Brabant. This erle came to his
lande a yonge man / and had a frewyll to diſpende
largely / and thought full lytell of the
ende that myght come after. He cared for nothynge
but for to accomplyſſhe his pleaſure / 
and haunted iuſtes and tourneys to his gret
coſt / to gette hym renome. And euery yere he
ſpended four tymes as moche as the value of
the reuenewes of his landes. He borowed of
the lombardes in dyuers places / he was ſo
lyberall and outragious: He ran ſo in dette / 
that he coulde nat ayde hym ſelfe with any
thynge that he had / ſo that his parentes and
frendes greatly blamed hym / and ſpeciallye
an vncle of his by his mothers ſyde / He came
of the houſe of Orcle / and was archebyſſhop
of Coleygne / who ſayd to hym in maner of
gyueng hym counſayle. My fayre nephewe
Raynolde / ye haue ſo demeaned youre ſelfe / 
that nowe ye are become a poore manne / and
your lādes lyeth in pledge in dyuers places.
And throughe all the worlde there is but lytell
accompte made of poore lordes. Thynke
you that ſuche as haue hadde theſe great giftes
of you and profite wyll rendre it againe / 
as god ayde me no? But whan they ſe you
in this poore caſe and haue no more to gyue
them / they wyll flye fro youre company and
mocke you and youre foule larges. ye ſhall
fynde them no frendes. Thynke nat though
I be byſſhoppe of Coleyne / that I ought to
breke or myniſſhe myne eſtate to helpe you / 
nor to gyue you of the patrimony of my churche?
Surely I wyll nat do it / nor my conſcyence?
ſhall neuer agre therto / nor alſo ye pope
nor the cardynals wyll nat ſuffre it: Therle
of Heynalt hath nat behaued hym ſelf (as ye
haue done) who hath gyuen Margarett his
eldeſt doughter in maryage to the kynge of
Almayne Loys of Bauyers / and yet he hath
thre other / he wyll marry them all highly. yf
ye hadde well borne your ſelfe / and nat haue
layde your heritage to pledge / nor put out of
your hādes none of your caſtels nor townes / 
ye might ryȝtwell haue fortuned to haue had
one of his doughters in maryage / but in the
caſe ye be in now / ye ſhall neuer come therto
ye haue (as nowe) nother townes nor caſtels
that ye maye endowe any woman with all / 
nat ſo moche as a poore lordſhyppe. This
erle of Guerles was ſore abaſſhed with the
wordes of the byſſhop his vncle / for he knew
well he ſhewed hym but trouthe: And than
for loue and kyndred he deſyredde his counſayle.
Counſayle fayre nephue quod the byſſhop:
it is to late. ye wyll cloſe faſte the ſtable
whan the Horſe is loſte: Howe be it I ſe

in all your buſyneſſe but one remedy. What
remedy quod the erle? I ſhall ſhewe you ꝙ
the byſſhoppe.
            BErthaulte of Malygnes (who is as
nowe renomed the rycheſt man of ſyluer
and golde / that is knowen in any place / 
by reaſon of the courſe of marchaundiſe that
he vſeth / bothe by lande and by ſee. He occupyeth
to Dāmas / to Cayre / and to Alexādre.
His galyes and marchaūdyſe are worthe an
hundred thouſande floreyns) hath to pledge
parte of your herytage. this Berthault hath
a fayre doughter to mary / and he hath no mo
chyldren / Great and high barons of Almaygne
in thoſe marches haue deſyred her in maryage / 
for them ſelues and for their ſonnes.
This I knowe well / and yet they coude neuer
come to their entētes / for ſome he refuſed
and ſome he thought nat worthy. wherfore I
wolde counſayle you yt ye ſhulde treate with
this Berthault / deſyring to haue his doughter
in maryage / ſo yt he wyll redeme all your
landes and paye all your dettes / and bring agayne
in to your hādes / your townes / caſtelles / 
and lordſhippes / perteyning vnto your
herytaunce. And I ſuppoſe bycauſe ye be of
an high lynage and of great ſignorie / & haue
many townes cyties / and caſtels / bytwene ye
ryuers of Meuſe and Ryne / that he wyll enclyne
to your requeſt. Sir ꝙ therle of Guerles / 
ye counſayle me truely and I ſhall ſo do.
Than after therle of Guerles aſſembled togider
his coūſayle and frendes / ſuche as loued
hym beſt / and diſcouered his entent to them.
and deſyred them to go in his name to ye ſayd
Berthault of Malignes / and to treate honorably
with hym for that mater. Whan theſe
knightes and clerkes came to Berthalt / ſent
fro the erle of Guerles / he made them good
chere and made them a curteſſe anſwere / and
ſaid he wolde take aduyſement. And he was
riche beyond meaſure / as worthe a .v. or ſixe
hūdred .M. florens. And deſyred the aduaū
               cement
of his doughter / Thynkynge that he
wyſt nat where to mary her more highly / thā
to therle of Guerles (thought to accepte this
maryage) but or he fullye aſſented therto in
hymſelfe / he had dyuers ymaginacions / and
caſt many doutes and ſayd to hymſelfe. yf I
mary my doughter to this Erle / and he haue
chyldren by her and than ſhe happen to dye / 
as all thynges fall dayly. than he that ſhalbe
made riche with my goodes / and put againe
in to poſſeſſyon of his townes and caſtelles / 
Happe to mary agayne ſecondly in to ſome
high blode / and haue children agayne by her
Thoſe chyldren than cōmynge out of noble
lynage by their mothers ſyde / ſhall be more
made of than ye chyldren iſſued of my doughter.
yea? And moreouer lyke to be dyſenheryted.
Wherfore without this be artycled I
wyll neuer conſent therto. How be it I wyll
anſwere theſe meſſanges that their cōmyng
pleaſeth me greatlye / and that my doughter
ſhulde be happy if ſhe myght cōe to ſo great
a perfection / as to be conioyned in maryage
to the erle of Guerles / thoughe it ſhulde coſt
me right derely / ſo that ye maters were clere.
But as nowe / euery man knoweth well they
be nat clere / but in ſore trouble. And alſo he
hath forfayted all his herytage bytwene the
ryuers of Mueſe and Ryne. Wherfore to be
quyte of this / euery man maye ſe clerely / he
demaundeth my doughter in maryage. and
if I gyue her to hym / I wyll knowe howe it
ſhall be. And alſo / if caſe that my doughter
haue ſonne or dough
                  •
                by hym / I wyll know
if they ſhalbe heyres of Guerles or no / for any
other maryage that the erle may happe to
haue after. And of this alyaūce I wyll haue
good ſuretie of hym and of them that be next
of his blode / and of ſuche as haue any ryght
to demaunde any ſucceſſyon in the countrie of
Guerles / and alſo promyſe of the noble men
and good townes of the countre. Thus Berthaulte
of Malygnes determyned hym ſelfe
to make anſwere to therle of Guerlrs cōmyſſyoners.
            THe next daye at an hour aſſigned the
erles meſſanges came to Berthaldes
lodgynge / and there he ſhewed well that he
was a ryche man. Berthault mette them in
his hall / and ſwetely recyued thē and ſpake
to them merilye / and than ledde them in to a
fayre chambre apparelled and dreſſed / and it
had benfor a kyng / and had there about hym
ſome of his frendes. And whan they were all
there aſſembled and the doore cloſed: Than
Berthaulte deſyred them to ſhewe the cauſe
of their cōmynge / whervpon he wolde make
them a fynall anſwere / and ſo they dyd. And
the deane of Coleygne a ryght ſage Clerke

and coſyn to the erle of Guerles ſpake / and
there ſhewed theffecte of their ambaſſade / in
ſuche wyſe / that it was ioye to here hym. Of
his wordes nor of his requeſtes I nede nat
to ſpeke any more / for they haue ben ſhewed
here before / & touched at length. Than Berthaulte
anſwered as he had deuyſed in hym
ſelfe the day before / and ſayd. Fayre lordes I
repute my ſelfe gretly honored & my dough
                  •
               
alſo / if we might come to ſo hygh an en
                  •
               priſe
as the erle of Guerles deſyreth. And whan a
mater is begon / it wolde nat be prolōged. I
ſaye this bycauſe that alyaunce by maryage
made bytwene the hyghe prince and redouted
lorde the erle of Guerles / and Mary my
doughter pleaſeth me rightwell. ye make me
requeſt that his landes (whiche at this preſente
tyme / are ſo ſore charged and layde to
pledge / in the handes of certayne lombardes
and other / by reaſon of this maryage ſhulde
be quyt / and that I ſhulde rydde hym out of
dette / And all thynges that are nowe darke / 
I ſhulde make them clere. I thanke god of
his puiſſaūce that it lyeth in me thus to do / &
I am in good wyll ſo to do. But firſt or this
couenaunt be fully agreed / written or ſealed / 
that I maye be in ſuretie without trouble or
debate / that ye chyldren comyng of my doughter
maye be enherytours to the Erldome of
Guerles / as the lymites therof do ſtretche. &
that if my lorde therle of Guerles fortune to
dye before my doughter / wtout iſſue bytwene
them / that than my doughter may enioye the
herytage of Guerles duryng her lyfe / and af
                  •
               
her dyſceaſe / to returne to ye rightfull heyre.
And alſo I ſaye / if my doughter haue heyre
or heyres by my lorde therle / and than ſhe fortune
to dye / thoughe the erle than remacy againe
the ſeconde tyme / and haue iſſue by the
ſeconde wyfe / yet for all that my doughters
heyre or heyres ſhall nat be diſheryted. how
be it if it pleaſe the erle to remary agayne / I
am contente that he make his ſeconde wyfe a
dower of all ſuche landes as he hath beyond
the ryuer of Muſe / marchyng to the byſſhoprike
of Liege / and to the duchy of Brabant / 
and nat to charge the princypall ſignorie of
Guerles. And thus if the erles frendes and
parentes / and ſuche as be next of blode / and
haue any chalenge to the ſignory of Guerles
with the good townes of the countrey / wyll
ſeale to vpholde theſe deuyſes and couenaū
               tes / 
than I am cōtent and wyll aſſent to this
maryage. ye may nowe anſwere to this if ye
haue any charge ſo to do. Than the knyghtꝭ
anſwered whan they had a lytell counſayled
toguyder. Than one for them all ſayd / ſir we
haue well herde your anſwere / but we haue
none auctorite to confyrme nor to graunt ſo
farforthe as ye demaunde / But we ſhall retourne
to our lorde therle and to his coūſaile
and ſhewe hym your anſwere and demaūde / 
and ſhortely ye ſhall here fro hym agayne.
Than Berthalte ſaid. ſirs / as god wyll ſo be
it. Thus they deꝑted out of the chambre.

ſpeke no more therof. But (as ye
haue herde) whan therle of guerles
meſſangers were returned home agayn / 
The erle was hoote in the mater / for he ſawe
well he coude as than do no better / thā to mary
Berthalt of Malygnes doughter / he was
ſo riche a man. Than the erle and his counſaile
made and deuyſed writynges ſufficient
and therle ſet to his ſeale / and his next frēdes
and parētes / in lykewiſe ſo dyd other knightes
of Guerles and good townes. And whan
all was confyrmed and done as Berthaulte
was content / ye maryage was made / and the
erles dettes payde / and his Landes clerely
quytte out of daunger. Than the Erle toke
newe counſayle / and began a newe lyfe and

ſtate / if he were called good before he was named
better after / for than he had well wherwith.
he lacked nothyng of that Berthault of
Malygnes myght ayde hym. The erle bare
hym to his wyfe ryght honourably / for ſhe
was a fayre lady good / ſage / deuout / & prudent:
but they were nat toguyder paſt a four
yeres / but that the lady dyed / And ſhe had a
doughter called Iſabell. whan therle of guerles
was a wydower he was but yong. Than
he maryed agayne ryght highly / For kynge
Edwarde of Englande / father to the good
kyng Edwarde who beſeged Tourney and
wanne Ealis / he gaue to this erle Raynolde
a doughter of his named Iſabell / and by her
this erle had thre chyldren / two ſonnes & one
doughter / ſir Raynolde & ſir Edwarde / and
Iane / who afterwarde was duches of Guerlers.
For in lykewiſe as Bertram of Malignes
had ymagined in the begynnyng / whan
his doughter maryed the erle of Guerles / euyn
ſo it fell / for there was no trouthe kepte
to hym. For whan kynge Edwarde of Englande / 
who was vncle to the erle of Guerles
chyldren / came firſt in to Almayne to the
Emperour Loyes of Bauyers / whiche Emperour
inſtytuted kynge Edwarde to be his
vycar generall / throughe all the marches of
the Empyre / as it is conteyned in the begynnyng
of this boke. Than the coūtie of Guerles
was made a duchy / and the countie of Iulyers
was made marques of Iulyers to augment
their dignities. And to come to our mater / 
the duke Raynolde of Guerles / nephue
to kynge Edwarde dyed without iſſue / and
ſir Edward of Guerles was maryed in Heynault / 
and had to wyfe the yongeſt doughter
of duke Aubert / but the lady was ſo yonge / 
that this ſir Edwarde neuer touched her carnallye.
And ſo this ſir Edwarde alſo dyed
withoute iſſue / who was a ryght valyaunt
knight. He was ſlayne in the batayle yt was
bytwene the duke of Brabant and duke Wincelant
before Iulyers. His ſuſter Iane who
was maryed to duke Guylliam of Iulyers
had chyldren. And ſhe by ſucceſſyon of her
bretherne ſaid and toke vpon her to be heyre
to the duchy of Guerles / and in lykewyſe ſo
dyde her eldeſt ſuſter by the firſte maryage / 
For the two bretherne by the ſeconde maryage
were bothe deed / withoute laufull iſſue.
Wherfore ſhe ſayde / ſhe was enherytoure.
Thus fell the difference bytwene the two ſuſters / 
and ſome of the countrey wolde haue
the one and ſome the other. And the eldeſt
ſuſter was counſayled to mary in to ſome high
lygnage / that myght ayde her chalenge and
defende her herytage. Than there was treatie
made by the byſſhoppe of Coloygne that
was than: to the lorde ſir Iohan of Bloyes / 
For therle Loyes his brother as than lyued.
and the byſſhoppe ſayd / that he ſhulde therby
be duke of Guerles / For by ſucceſſyon of
the two bretherne deed withoute iſſue male / 
Therfore by right of mariage / ye right ſhuld
retourne to her / for none other coude chalēge
any right but ſhe. And ſir Iohan of Bloyes
who alwayes had ben nouriſſhed & brought
vp in the parties of Hollande and zelande
(for there he had fayre herytage / and had the
language of that countre. And he neuer had
wyll to mary in Fraūce) layde his eare glad
lye to this treatie / and ſawe well he myght
therby haue great poſſeſſiōs in the marches / 
that he loued beſte. And alſo the knyghtes of
Hollande that were of his counſayle / counſayled
hym therto. So he accepted that maryage / 
but firſt or he wolde conclude / he ſayd
he wolde ryde in to Heynault and Queſnoy
to ſpeke with his coſyn the duke Auberte / to
ſe what counſayle he wolde gyue hym. But
to ſaye trouthe / duke Aubert wyſt nat what
to counſayle hym. And if he dyd / he made no
ſemblaunt therof / but diſſymuled the mater
a lytell / So that ſir Iohn̄ of Bloyes wolde
no lengar tarye to haue his counſayle / But
toke his horſe and retourned as ſoone as he
coude in to Guerles / and wedded this lady / 
and dyd put her in poſſeſſion of the countre.
But ſome there were that wolde nat receyue
hym to their lorde / nor her to their lady: For
the mooſt parte of the knyghtes and ſquiers
and good townes of the countre / helde with
the ducheſſe of Iulyers / for that lady hadde
fayre chyldren / wherfore they of Guerles loued
her the better.
            THus ſir Iohn̄ of Bloys had his wyfe
and poſſeſſyons / whiche coſt hym moche
after: For the erle Loys his brother dyed
And than he was erle of Bloyes & lorde Dauenes
in Heynault / and had all the landes in
Hollande and zelande / & had in the ſayd coū
               ties
great herytage. & alwayes his coūſayle

counſayled hym to purſue for his ryght that
he ought to haue by his wife in Guerles / & ſo
he dyde to his power. But the almayns are
ſo couetous / they wolde make no warre for
hym no lengar than his money endured. and
the chalenge yt he made to the duchy of Guerles
dyd him neuer ꝓfyte / but great domage.
Than dyed this gentyll knight ſir Iohan of
Bloyes / in the caſtell and towne of Eſlone
Houe / the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and one / in ye moneth
of Iune / and was buryed in the freres at Valencenes / 
beſyde ſir Iohan of Heynault his.
And than was his brother ſir
Guy of Bloyes erle / and helde all the landes
by ryght ſucceſſyon yt his two bretherne had
helde / aſwell in Fraunce / Picardy / Heynalt
Hollande / and zelande / as in the countie of
Bloyes.
            I Knowe nat howe many yeres after the
lady dyed / who had ben wyfe to therle
Iohn̄ of Bloys / her ſuſter the duches of Iuliers
abode peſably duches of guerles It was
ordayned by thaccorde of the countre / and at
the requeſt of the knightes & good townes of
the duchy of Guerles / yt they ſhulde take to
their lorde ſir Willm̄ of Iuliers / eldeſt ſon to
the duke of Iuliers / for the lāde came to hym
rightfully by ſucceſſion of his vncles. and by
reaſon therof / duke Aubert and ye duches his
wyfe gaue hym there doughter in maryage / 
who before had ben maried to ſir Edward of
Guerles. Thus the lady was doughter of
Heynault and duches of Guerles. and whan
ſhe maried the duke of Guerles / ſonne to the
duke of Iulyers they were bothe of one age / 
wherfore the maryage was the more agreable.
This yong duke of Guerles helde hym
in his owne countrey / and thelder he waxed / 
the more he loued dedes of armes / as iuſtes
and tourneys. and alwayes the duke was rather
Englyſſhe than trēche / and that he ſhewed
well as long as he lyued: And alwayes
he bare in his mynde / the yuell wyll that his
predeceſſours had to the duchy of Brabant.
& alwayes he ſought occaſion how he might
make warre there for two reaſōs. the one bycauſe
he was alyed by faythe and homage to
kyng Richarde of Englande: the other was
bycauſe Wyncelant of Boeſme duke of Luſē
               burge
and of Brabant / had bought of therle
of Mors a great lorde in Almayne / the thre
foreſaid caſtelles / the whiche I ſhall name agayne
to quicken the mater / Gaulech / Buch
and Nulle / on the otherſyde of the ryuer of
Muſe in the lande of Falquemount: whiche
caſtels aunciently ꝑteyned to ye duke of guerles
and was enherytour to thē. And therfore
the yōg duke Willm̄ of Iuliers duke of guerles
was ſore diſpleaſed / that he might nat recouer
his herytage. as long as duke Wyncelant
of Brabāt lyued he ſpake no worde therof.

               SO it was that duke Reynolde
of Guerles / coſyn germayne to
the prince of Guerles / and his
brother had before that enguaged
the threfor ſaid caſtels for a

He was ſore diſpleaſed and ſent ſuffycient ſō

The duke made no compte therof / for he had
nat wherwith to redeme them agayne. & the
erle of Mors ſawe that he came to ye duke of
Brabant / & treated with hym to haue agayn
his money for the ſayde caſtelles. The duke
herde hym well / bycauſe the caſtels marched
on the lande of Faulquemoūt / of the whiche

of warre / a .xii. hundred ſpeares. And ſir Edwarde
of Guerles made his aſſemble on the
other parte / and were in that caſe that it was
likely to haue had a batayle bytwene them.
But the duke Aubert / the duke of Mours / &
the duke of Iullyers mette togyder by a treatie / 
and ſo this aſſemble departed a ſondre wt
out any thyng doyng. The ſame yere ye duke
Wyncelant of Brabant ouerthrewe the companyons
in the coūtrey of Luſenburge / who
had greatly waſted that lande / and putte many
to exyle: and in the towre of the caſtell of
Luſenburge dyed their ſouerayne capitayne
called the lytell Meſlyn. And alſo in ye ſame
yere ſir Charles of Boeſme / who as than raigned
and was kynge of Almaygne and emperour
of Rome / inſtytuted duke Wyncelāt
of Boeſme and made hym ſouerayne regarder / 
by an inſtytucion and ordynaunce called
in Almayne / Le langue fride / that is to ſay / 
holding the couert and ſure wayes. So that
all maner of people myght go and come / and
ryde fro towne to towne ſurely and in ſauegarde.
And the Emperour gaue hym a great
parte of the lande and countrey of Dauffay / 
on bothe ſydes the ryuer of Ryne / to defende
hym therin agaynſt the lynfars / who were a
maner of people ryght peryllous / and great
robbers without pytie. And alſo the Emperour
gaue hym the ſouerayntie of the good &
riche cytie of Straubourcke / and made him
Marques of the holy Empyre / to augment
therby his eſtate. And ſurely he coulde nat
gyue hym to moche / for this Duke Wyncelant
was lyberall / ſwete / courteſſe / amyable / 
and noble in armes: & was likely to atchyue
many thynges if he hadde lyued long / but he
dyed in the floure of his youthe. Wherof I
that haue written this hyſtorie make great
complaynt for hym / that he lyued no lengar / 
but tyll he was a .xxiiii. yere of age. Theſciſme
that was in the churche greatly diſpleaſed
hym / and that he ſhewed me often tymes
for I was priue of his acquayntaūce. in that
in my dayes I traueyled a great parte of the
worlde / two great princes I knewe and non
more hūble nor tretable than they were (that
was this noble prince one / and the other my
good mayſter the lorde Guy of Bloys / who
cōmaunded me to make this hyſtorie) Theſe
two princes were in my dayes / and wereful
of humilyte / larges / and bountie: without
any malyce. They lyued lyberally of their
owne / without oppreſſynge their people / or
reyſing vp of any yuell cuſtomes in their lā
               des.
¶Nowe let vs retourne to the pythe of
the mater / that I haue begone.
            
               WHan ye duke of Iulyers and ſir
Edwarde of Guerles / who called
thēſelfe bretherne / and their
hertes good Engliſſhe / for they
had ben long alyed with ye kyng
of Englande / and with loue and fauour had
alwayes ayded them in their warres. Whan
they ſawe that the duke of Brabant hadde ſo
hygh a ſignory / as to be lorde and ſouerayne
regarder by the Emperonr / and was chiefe
correctour of all myſdoers and robbers / that
he founde lyueng by the highe wayes of Almaygne.
They had therat indygnacion and
enuy / nat for that he dyde well and helde iuſtyce / 
and corrected yuell doers: but of that
he had the ſouerayne regarde & ſignory ouer
lāgue fride / whiche was parte in their lande
whiche offyce was firſt inſtytued yt marchautes
might peſably paſſe fro Brabant to Heynault / 
to Flaunders / to Fraūce / or fro Liege

to Coleyne / and to other cyties / townes and
fortreſſes of Almayne. And nother marchauntes
nor other coulde nat paſſe nor entre in to
Almayne / by the landes and daungers of the
duke of Iulyers and ye duke of Guerles. And
ſoo it was / that certayne robbers were in the
wayes of Linfars. And it were they that had
done the vyolence and paſſynge through the
landes of the duke of Iuliers. It was ſhewed
me that the duke had lente them horſe and caſtels.
Great complayntes came to duke Wyncelant
of Brabant and of Luzenbourge / who
as than was at Bruſelles / howe that the Languefryde
wherof he was ſouerayne regarder
and keper / was broken & violated. and howe
they that dyde that vyolence / and robbed the
countrey / ſoiourned and euer retourned in to
the duchy of Iulyers. The duke of Brabante
(who as than was yonge and luſty / and puyſſaunte
of lynage and of landes) toke in great
diſpyte the offences that his people had complayned
of / and ſaid how he wolde fynde ſome
remedy / ſeynge he had in charge to kepe and
defende the Languefride. He wolde nat that
through his neclygence he ſhulde take any reproche
or blame. and to conclude his dede and
to ſette reaſon in their demaunde / and by the
counſayle and aduyſe that he had / he ſente to
the duke of Iulyers notable perſones / as the
lorde of Vrquon lorde of Bourguenall / ſyr
Scelar archedecon of Heynalt / Geffrey de la
towre / great rowter of Brabante / and other.
ſhewyng to him in wyſe and ſwete maner the
offence / whiche greatly toucheth and is preiudyciall
to the duke of Brabante / who is keper
and ſouerayne regarder of the Languefride.
The duke of Iulyers fayntely excuſed hym
ſelfe / for by that he ſhewed he had as lefe haue
had the warre as the peace / ſo that the duke of
Brabantes meſſangers were nat well cōtent:
and ſo toke their leaue of the duke of Iuliers / 
and reiourned and ſhewed the duke of Brabant
all as they had herde and ſene. Whan the
duke herde that / he demaūded what was beſt
to do. He was aunſwered by his coūſayle ſayenge.
ſir / ye knowe beſt your ſelfe. Well quod
the duke / and I ſaye yt it is my entenſyon that
I wyll nat ſlepe ſo in this blame / nor that it
ſhall be said that for ſlouth or faynte hert / that
I ſhulde ſuffre vnder my ſauegarde robbers
to do vilaynes and robories vnpunyſſhed. I
ſhewe and wyll ſhewe to my coſyn of Iuliers
and to his aydes / that this mater toucheth me
nere. This duke cooled nat his entent / but in
contynent ſet clerkes a warke / and ſent to them
that he thought wolde ayde hym. Some he
prayed / and ſome he commaunded / and ſente
ſufficyent knoledge of his mynde to the duke
of Iuliers and to his alies. bothe theſe lordes
made great preparacion. The duke of Iulyers
had but lytell ayde / but of his brother ſyr
Edwarde of Guerles / he greatly cōforted him
with men and with frendes. Theſe two lordes
ſent priuely for men farre in to Almayne. And
bycauſe that almayns are couetous / deſyring
to wynne / and it had bene longe before or they
were in any place / where they myght get any
good aduenture. They wolde haue come in
more habundaunce and they had nat knowen
that they ſhulde haue had to do agaynſte the
duke of Brabante. The duke of Brabante in
great aray departed fro Bruſelles / and went
to Louayne / and fro thence to Treete on the
ryuer of Mueſe / and there he founde a thouſande
ſpeares abydinge for hym / and always
there came menne to hym fro all partyes / fro
Fraunce / fro Flaūders / fro Haynalt / fro Namure / 
fro Lorayne & other countreys / ſo that
he had two thouſande and fyue hundred ſpeares
of good men of warre. and alſo there came
to hym out of Burgoyne the lorde of Graunt / 
and with hym a foure hundred ſpeares / but
they came to late / for they knewe nat the daye
of the buſyneſſe that I ſhall ſhewe you / wherwith
they were ſore dyſpleaſed / whanne they
herde that the mater was done without them.
The duke of Brabant beinge at Trect / herde
but lytell newes of his enemyes. Than he departed
fro Trect the wednyſdaye / and wente
and lodged in the lande of his enemyes / and
there lay all that nyght / and the thurſday tyll
he herde certayne tydynges. It was ſhewed
hym by his corours that his enemyes were abrode.
Than he rode forwarde / and cōmaunded
to burne in the duke of Iuliers land/and
the thurſday toke his lodginge betymes. And
the vowarde kept the erle Guy of Ligney / erle
of ſaynt Pole and ſir Valeran his ſonne / who
as than was but yong / of a ſixtene yere of age / 
and there he was made knyght. The duke of
Iuliers came the ſame thurſday / and lay nere
one to another. and by all lyklyhode ye almaynes
knewe the demeanour of the brabanſoys / 
better than they dyd theirs / for on the fridaye

betymes whan the duke of Brabant had herd
maſſe / and that all were in the felde & thought
nat to haue fought ſo ſoone. Than came redy
the duke of Iuliers and ſir Edwarde of Guerles
well mounted with a great batayle. Than
one ſayd to the duke of Brabante. ſyr / beholde
yōder your enemys put your helmes on your
heedes / in the name of god and ſaynt George.
Of that worde the duke had great ioye. The
ſame day he had by him four ſquiers of great
price / worthy to ſerue an hyghe prince and to
be aboute hym / for they had ſene many dedes
of armes. they were called Iohan de Valcon / 
Baudwyn of Beauforde / Gyrarde of Byes / 
and Roulande of Colongne. Aboute the duke
were the bruſelloys / ſome a horſebacke with
their varlettes behynde them / with botelles of
wyne truſſed at their ſadelles / and paſtyes of
ſamonde / troutes / and elys wraped in towels.
Theſe horſemen greatly combred the place / ſo
that there was ſuch preaſe that no man coude
ſtyrre. Than Gyrarde of Bi
                  ••
                ſaid to ye duke / 
ſi
                  •
                cōmaunde theſe horſes to a voyde the place
they ſhall greatly let vs / we can nat ſe aboute
vs nor haue knoledge of your reregarde / nor
vowarde / nor of your marſhall ſir Roberte of
Namure. So let it be quod the duke / I commaunde
ſo. Than Gyrarde toke his glayue in
his handes and ſo dyd his companyons / and
began to ſtryke on their helmes and on their
horſes / ſo that a none the place was voyded of
them / for no man was glad to haue his horſe
ſlaine or hurte. Than the duke of Iuliers and
ꝓ Edwarde of Guerles & their company came
on theym / and founde the erle of ſaynt Poule
and his ſonne in the vowarde / and daſſhed in
ſo ferſely amonge them / that anone they were
broken and diſcomfited / and there were many
ſlayne / taken / and hurte. that was the batayle
that had moſte to do. There was ſlayne Guy
the erle of ſaynte Poule / and ſir Valeran his
ſonne taken. The batayle tourned to a herde
parte for the duke of Brabante / and for them
that were with him. for of men of honour there
were but a fewe ſaued / but outher they were
ſlayne or taken / The duke of Brabante was
taken / and ſyr Roberte of Namure / and ſyr
Loys of Namure his brother / and ſir Willyam
of Namure ſonne to the erle of Namure / 
and many other. Alſo on the duke of Iulyers
parte there were ſome ſlaine and hurte. but ye
know well it is a generall rule / the great loſſe
euer reſteth on them that be diſconfyted. howe
be it for all the domage the duke of Brabante
had in that iourney / yet they hadde one great
poynte of remedy & comforte / for ſir Edwarde
of Guerles was wounded to dethe. And this
I ſaye bycauſe it was the opinyon of dyuerſe / 
that if he had lyued he wolde haue rydden ſo
forwarde / that with puyſſaūce he wolde haue
come to Bruſelles and conquered all the coū
               treye / 
for none wolde haue reſyſted hym. He
was hardy and fierſe / and hated the brabanſoys / 
bycauſe of the thre caſtels that they helde
agaynſt hym. This iourney and victory had
the duke of Iulyers in ye yere of our lorde god / 
a thouſande thre hūdred and a leuen / on ſaynt
Bartylmewes euyn / on a fridaye.
            THe duches of Brabant purchaſed her
frendes / and had counſayle of Charles
the frenche kyng / who was nephue to the duke
of Brabāt an all his bretherne / for they were
chyldren of his ſuſter. ſhe was counſayled by
the kynge to go to the kynge of Almayne emperoure / 
brother to the duke of Brabante / for
whoſe ſake the duke her huſbande had taken
all that domage. The lady dyd ſo and came to
Conualence on the ryuer of the Ryne / & there
founde the Emperoure / And there wyſely ſhe
made her complaynte. The emperoure herde
her well / the whiche he was boūde vnto by dyuerſe
reaſons. The one bycauſe the duke was
his brother / and another bycauſe he had inſtitude
hym to be his vycare / and ſouerayne regarder
of the Languefryde. he comforted the
lady and ſayd / that at the next ſōmer he wolde
fynde ſome remedy. The lady retourned into
Brabante well comforted. And the emperour
ſir Charles of Boeſme ſlept nat his buſynes / 
but waked the mater / as ye ſhall here. For as
ſoone as wynter was paſt he aproched to the
noble cytie of Coloyne / & there made his prouyſion / 
in ſuche wyſe as though he wolde go
to conquere a realme of defence / and wrote to
his dukes & erles that helde of hym / and commaunded
them at the thyrde day of Iune they
ſhulde be with hym at Ayes / with fyfty horſe
a pece / on payne of leſyng of their landes. and
ſpecially he cōmaunded thre / as duke Auberte
erle of Haynalte / that he ſhulde come to Ayes
with fyfty horſe / and ſo he dyd. Whanne theſe
lordes were come / there was moche people.
And than ſyr Charles his ſonne ſayde that he

wolde go and entre in to ye landes of duke Iulyers
& deſtroy it / bycauſe of the great outrage
that he had done / as in enteryng in to the felde
with an army againſt the emperours vycaire
his brother. this ſentēce was gyuen by playne
iudgement in the emperours chambre. Than
to that mater regarded the archebyſſhoppe of
Treues / the archbyſſhoppe of Coloyne / the
byſſop of Marauce / the byſſhoppe of Liege / 
the duke Aubert of Bauier / the duke Oſte his
brother / and diuerſe other barons of Almayne
(that thought) to dyſtroy the landes of ſo valyaunt
a knyght as was the duke of Iulyers / 
ſhulde be yuell done / and alſo he was nere of
their kynne. They ſayde it were better fyrſte
to ſende for hym / that he myght come to obeyſaunce.
That apoyntment was holden for the
beſt / for the loue of bothe partyes. Than duke
Auberte and his brother came to Iuliers / and
found there the duke / who was abaſſhed / and
wyſte nat what counſayle to beleue / for it had
ben ſhewed him that the aſſemble that the emperour
had made was to come on hym / without
his frendes dyd ſtoppe it. Whan theſe lordes
were come to the duke he was gladd / ſpecyally
by the comynge of his two coſyns germayns / 
the duke Aubert of Bauiers and the
duke Oſte his brother / for he knewe well that
they wolde nat his dyſhonoure / but rather to
gyue hym good coūſayle / as they dyd. Their
counſayle was to ſhewe you breuely / that he
ſhulde ſende ſome honorable perſones for the
duke of Luſenburge and of Brabant / whome
he helde in curtoyſe priſon in his caſtell of Nideque / 
and ſo he dyd. And whan he was come
all thoſe lordes dyd hym great honour / as reaſon
was. And than they all departed togyder / 
and came to Ayes and toke their lodgynges.
Than the duke Auberte and his brother / and
the foreſayd prelates / who were the meanes of
this treatye. they ſore entreated the emperour
and his counſayle / and ſhewed the emperoure
howe ye duke of Iuliers his coſyn / of his owne
free wyll was come to ſe hym / and to put hym
ſelfe poorely with out any reſeruacyon / into
his obeyſaunce and commaundement / and to
knowledge hym for his ſoueraygne and liege
lorde. Theſe ſwete and amyable wordes molefyed
greatly the emperours ire that he had
before. Than the emperoure ſayd. Lette the
duke come to me? and ſo he dyde / and kneled
downe before the emperoure and ſayde. My
ryght redoubted ſouerayne / I beleue well ye
are dyſpleaſed with me / bycauſe of your brother
in lawe the duke of Brabante / whome I
haue helde longe in priſon / for the which cauſe
I ſubmytte my ſelfe to abyde your ordre and
your counſayles. To that worde themperour
gaue none aunſwere / but his ſonne ſir Charles / 
who was called kynge of Boeſme / aunſwered
and ſayde. Duke of Iulyers / ye haue
ben to outragyous to kepe our vncle ſo longe
in priſone. And if it were nat at the deſyre of
your well be loued coſyns / duke Auberte and
duke Oſte of Bauyers / this buſyneſſe wolde
haue ben ſoer layd to your charge than it is / 
for ye haue well deſerued to be hyghly punyſſhed.
but chaunge your copye ſo that we haue
no cauſe to renew our yuell wylles agaynſte
you / for & ye do it wyll be coſtly to you. Than
the duke of Iulyers beynge on his kne before
the emperoure (where as he ſate in his chayre
imperiall) ſayde. My ryght redoughted ſouerayne
lorde / by your puyſſaunt hyghnes / I
knowledge my ſelfe to haue treſpaſſed youre
maieſte / in that I with an army came againſt
my coſyn your vycaire of the empyre / and in
that I haue helde hym as my priſoner / I delyuer
hym vnto you freely and quyte / and I
requyre your grace that you nor he beare me
any yuell wyll fro hence forthe. Than the prelates
and the princes there beynge preſente / to
helpe forwarde his wordes ſayde. Ryght noble
prince this ſuffyſeth that your coſyn of Iulyers
hath ſayd. Well quod the emperour / we
are content / and ſo toke hym vp by the hande.
And as it was ſhewed me for the confyrmacion
of more loue / he kyſt the duke on the mouth
and alſo his ſonne the kynge of Boeſme. And
than the duke of Brabante was delyuered out
of priſon / and all ſuche as were priſoners vnder
the duke of Iulyers / and were nat raunſomed
before / were delyuered quyte / by reaſon
of the compoſycion of the treatie. and this
done euery manne retourned to their owne.
The emperour wente to Prage in Almayne / 
and the duke of Brabant in to Brabante / 
and whanne the duke of Brabante
was retourned / than he reyſed
a newe tayle in his coūtrey
to reſtore to his knightes
parte of their
domages.

               I Am yet wyllynge to
treate of this matter more
at lengthe / to renforce this
hyſtorye / and to brynge it
to the poynte that I wolde
come vnto. & to declare the
trouthe / why Charles the
frenche kyng came with a great puyſſaunce in
to Almayne. I might haue ſhewed this before
but I haue prolonged it (for all thingꝭ though
the date and ſeaſon be paſte yet they ought to
be ſhewed in this hyſtory) for whan I knowe
that the frenche kynge and the kynge of England
began to be beſy / than I began to wake
to procede this hyſtory / more than I dyd before.
Therfore I ſaye thus. Whan duke Wyncelant
was returned in to the countrey / & clerely
delyuered out of perſon (as ye haue herde before)
Than he was in wyll to vyſyte his landes
and caſtels / as well in the duchy of Luzenbourge / 
as elſe where. and toke his iourney to
the good cytie of Straweſbourge / throughe
the lande of Fauquemount and behelde ye thre
caſtels whiche were the occaſion of the duke of
Guerles yuell wyll. He founde theym ſtronge
and fayre / if he loued thē before / he loued them
moche better than: and cauſed them to be newly
fortyfied / and ſet workemen a worke / as maſons / 
carpēters / and dykemakers / to amende
euery place. and at his departynge he ſet a valyaunt
knyght to be ſoueraygne keper of theſe
thre caſteles. This knyght was called ſir Iohan
Groſſet / who at the dukes commaundemente
toke on hym the charge / at his parell.
The duke paſſed further and vyſited his coū
               trey / 
and at his pleaſure retourned agayne in
to Brabante / for there was his abydynge. In
this ſeaſon ſyr Iohan of Blo
                  •
               s had wedded
the olde lady and duches of Guerles / for the herytage
by right came to hym / by the deth of ſir
Edwarde of Guerles his brother / who was
ſlayne (as ye haue herde / in the batayle of Iulyers)
But his ſuſter the duches of Iulyers
ſtroue with hym and made chalenge / and the
moſte parte of the knightes and good townes
inclyned moſt to the ladyes parte / bycauſe ſhe
had a fayre ſonne / who was able than to ryde.
and that was well ſene / for always he was in
the warres / ſo that ſir Iohn̄ de Bloyſe nor his
wyfe coulde neuer haue peaſable poſſeſſyon.
But the chalenge of the ryght of his wyfe and
the purſute therof / coſte hym aboue a hundred
thouſāde frankes. For the ſonne of duke Wyllyam
of Iuliers ſhewed well in his youth that
he was noble and hardy / and loued dedes of
armes / for he came of noble ertractyon. and ſo
was duke of Guerles / and had in mariage the
eldeſt doughter of duke Auberte / who had ben
wedded before to ſir Edward of Guerles / but
he had neuer carnally coupyled with her / for
ſhe was to yonge. Thus ſhe was maryed to
the lorde Willyam of Iulyers / and he and ſhe
were moche of one age. And ſoo ſhe was ſtyll
duches / as ſhe was before. This yonge duke
increaſed in honour / wytte / and prowes / and
in great wyll to haūte dedes of armes / and to
augment his herytage. And his he
                  •
               e was rather
englyſſhe than frenche / and ſayd always
(as yong as he was) that he wolde ayde to inſteyne
the kynge of Englandes quarell for he
was nerer of blode to hym than to the Frenche
kyng. It was ſhewed hym dyuerſe tymes
howe the brabanſoys dyd him great wronge / 
to kepe fro hym the thre caſtels. Than he aunſwered
and ſayd. Let vs ſuffre a ſenſon / euery
thynge muſte haue his turne? It is no ſeaſon
as yet for me to awake / for our coſyn of Brabante
hathe many great frendes / and he is a
ſage knight / but a tyme may come yt I ſhall a
wake. Thus the mater ſtode a ſeaſon / tyll god
toke oute of this lyfe duke Wyncelante / who
dyed duke of Boeſme / duke of Luſenbourge / 
and of Brabante / as it hath ben conteyned before
in this hyſtory. By the dethe of this duke
the duches of Brabant loſte moche. Than the
yonge duke of Guerles / who was ryght valyaunt / 
and lykely to dyſpleaſe his enemyes / 
and thought than to get and recouer agayne
his thre caſtelles / bycauſe of the debate that
was and had ben bytwene Brabante and his
vncle the lorde Edwarde of Guerles. Than
he ſente to treate with the duches of Brabant / 

to delyuer his caſtelles / for the ſomme of money
that they laye in pledge for / always affyrmynge
howe they laye but in guage. The
lady anſwered the meſſangers how ſhe was
in poſſeſſyon of them / and helde them as her
owne ryght and enherytaunce. But bycauſe
ſhe wolde the duke ſhulde be a good neyghbour
to Brabaunte / that he ſhulde leaue and
gyue vp the towne of Graue / the whiche he
helde in the duchy of Brabant. Whan ye duke
of Guerles had herde this aunſwere / he was
nothynge well contente: and thought great
diſpyte therof. And thought and ymagined
many thynges / and couertly he treated with
the knyght / called ſir Iohan of Groſſelotte / 
chiefe capitayne of the ſayde caſtelles / to aſſaye
if he coude gette them of hym / by byeng
for money / or otherwyſe. The knyght who
was trewe and ſage / wolde in no wyſe harken
therto. And ſente to the duke / deſyringe
hym to ſpeke no more therof: For to dye therfore
there ſhuld neuer faut be founde in hym
nor that he wolde conſente to do any trayſon
to his naturall lady. And whan the duke of
Guerles ſawe that (as I was enfourmed)
he dyde ſo moche to ſir Raynolde of Dyſcouorte / 
that he toke for a ſmall occaſyon a diſpleaſure
agaynſt the knyght: So that on a
daye he was mette with all in the feldes / and
there ſlayne / wherwith the ducheſſe of Brabante
was ſore diſpleaſed and ſo was all the
countre / and the caſtelles were putte in other
kepynge / by the agrement of the duches and
of the counſayle of Brabant.
            
               THus the matters ſtode certayne
yeres / and euer there noriſſhed
couert hate / what for the towne
of Graue on the one parte / and
for the thre caſtelles on the other
parte: Bytwene the duke of Guerles and the
duches of Brabant / and their countreis. and
they of the fronter of Guerles bare alwayes
yuell wyll couerlly againſt them of Brabant
ſuche as marched nere to them: and dyd euer
to them as moche dyſpleaſure as they coude
do / and ſpecially ſuche as were in the towne
of Graue. And bytwene the dukes woode
and the towne of Graue / there was but four
leages and a playne countrey / and fayre feldes
to ryde in. And they of Guerles dyde alwayes
there as great diſpyte to the brabanſoys / 
as they myght. And the mater went ſo
forwarde / that ye duke of Guerles paſſed the
ſee / and went in to Englande to ſekyng Rycharde
his coſyn / and his other coſins: as the
duke of Lancaſtre / the duke of yorke / ye duke
of Gloceſtre / and other great barons of Englande.
He had there good chere for they deſyred
to ſe hym / & to haue his acquayntaunce
for the Englyſſhe men knewe well that this
dukes herte / corage / ymaginacion / and affection / 
was rather Englyſſhe than Frenche.
In this vyage he made great alyaunce with
the kynge of Englande / and bycauſe at that
tyme he helde nothynge of the kynge of Englande / 
wherby he ſhulde beare hym faythe / 
homage / or ſeruyce. Therfore kyng Richarde
gaue hym in pencyon out of his coffers / a
thouſande marke by yere: And was counſayled
to aſſaye to gette his right fro the duches
of Brabant / and was promyſed to haue aide
of the Englyſſhe men / in ſuche wyſe / that he
ſhulde take no domage. And by this meanes
he ſware to be true and faithfull to the kyng / 
and to the realme of Englande. And whan
this alyaunce was made / he tooke his leaue
of the kynge and of his coſyns / and other barons
of Englande / And retourned in to his
owne countrey of Guerles: and ſhewed the
duke of Iulyers all that he hadde done / and
howe he ſhulde haue ayde and helpe of the
Englyſſhe men. And the duke of Iulyers / 
who by experyence of his age knewe farther
than the duke his ſonne dyde / made no countynaunce
of no great ioye: but ſayd. Sonne
Wyllyam / ye haue done ſo moche / that bothe
you and I maye fortune to repent youre goyng
in to Englāde. Do ye nat knowe howe
puyſſaunt the duke of Burgoyne is? no duke
more myghtie than he: And he loketh for
the herytage of Brabant. Howe maye ye reſyſt
agaynſt ſo puyſſaūt a lorde? Howe may
I reſyſt quod the duke of Guerles to ye duke
of Iulyers his father? The rychee & myghtier
that he is / the better it is to make warre
agaynſte hym. I hadde rather to haue a do
with a ryche man that hath great poſſeſſiōs
and herytage / than with hym that hath nothynge
to leſe / for there is nothynge to be cō
               quered.
For one Buffet that I ſhall receyue
I wyll gyue ſire. And alſo the kynge of Almayne
is alyed with the kyng of Englande.
If nede be I ſhalle haue ayde of hym. Well

quod the duke of Iuliers. Wylliam my fayre
ſonne / I feare me ye wyll playe the fole / your
wyſſhes and enterpriſes are more lyke to be
vnacomplyſſhed than atchyued.
            I ſhall ſhewe you why the duke of Iulyers
ſpake ſomwhat agaynſte the wyll of his
ſonne the duke of Guerles / and made dout in
his enterpriſe. Kynge Charles of Fraunce
laſte diſceſſed before this ſeaſon yt I ſpeke of
he dyde as moche as he coulde alwayes to
gette hym frendes on all partes / for it ſtode
hym in hande ſo to do / & for all that he coude
nat do ſo moche as to make reſyſtēce againſt
his ennemyes. Howe be it he dyde as moche
as he coude by gyftes and fayre promyſes / to
ſytte in reſt and to haue ayde / ſo that he gate
hym ſelfe many frendes / in the Empyre and
other places. So that whan the duke of Iulyers
was quyte delyuered oute of priſone / 
and was come to the duke of Brabant. The
kynge and he were great frendes toguyder / 
and by the ordynaūce the Emperour of Rome
dyde ſette. The duke of Iulyers wente
to Parys to ſe the kynge / and there he was
nobly receyued / and great gyftes gyuen to
hym and to his knyghtes. And than he made
relefe to the kynge for the ſignorie of Vyerſon / 
whiche parteyned to the coūtie of Bloys
whiche lande laye bytwene Bloys and Berrey / 
and was worthe by yere a fyue hundred
pounde of money / curraunt in Fraunce. And
there the duke of Iulyers ſware yt he ſhulde
neuer beare armure agaynſt the Crowne of
Fraunce. And ſo as longe as the kyng lyued
he kept his othe: For ſurely as long as kyng
Charles lyued he dyde hym no maner of domage / 
nor conſented to none to be done to the
crowne of Fraunce. But whan kyng Charles
was deed / & that Charles his ſonne was
kynge. By reaſon of the warres of Flaunders
(as it hath been ſhewed before in this
hyſtorie) And after he tooke his Creacyon
at Parys / He hadde ſo moche to do that he
coude nat take hede in euery place. The duof
Iulyers than came nat in to Fraunce / nor
made no relyefe for the landes of Vierſone.
Wherfore the duke of Berrey who toke hym
ſelfe as ſoueraygne / ſayde. Howe the relefes
parteyned to hym: And ſo ceaſed the landes
and toke ye profytes therof / and by puyſſaūce
putte out fro his ryght the Erle of Bloyes:
Howe be it the ſame tyme I ſawe them bothe
oftentymes togyder / and neuer debate made
bytwene them for any of the ſayd landes / nor
any yuell wyll ſhewed. There was good
cauſe for theym to be frendes toguyder / for
Loyes ſonne to the erle of Bloyes had in maryage
the lady Mary doughter to the duke
of Berrey. The duke of Iuliers wolde gladlye
haue entred in to his herytage / but he regarded
his ſonne / who ſhulde be his heyre.
Therfore he made but lytell counte of the alyaunce
that his ſonne the duke of Guerles
hadde made in Englande. And by this reaſon
he ſpake the wordes (that ye haue herde
here before) to the duke of Guerles / whan he
was retourned out of Englande. Howe be it
the duke of Guerles who was yonge and coragyous / 
toke lytell regarde to his fathers
wordes / and ſayde. Sir / that I haue done
I wyll vpholde: for I had rather haue warr̄
with the Frenche kynge than peace / and rather
with hym than with a poore man.

            ¶Howe the ducheſſe of Brabante
ſent meſſangers to the Frēche kyng
complaynyng of the duke of Guerles / 
And howe the kynge & his counſayle
were ſore buſyed with inſydentes
that fell in the realme of Fraūce / 
as well for the defyances of Guerles
as the buſyneſſe in Bretaygne.
Capi. C.xv.
            
               THe ducheſſe of Brabant
beynge at Bruſelles / 
was well enformed of all
theſe troubles: And howe
the duke of Guerles thretned
theym of Brabante to
make theym warre: The
ducheſſe feared the ſame and ſayde. Ah / god
aſſoyle the ſoule of my lorde and huſbande / 
for if he hadde lyued / the Duke of Guerles
durſt nat haue ſpoken of any ſuche matters.
But nowe bycauſe I am a woman and aged
he wyll make warre agaynſt me. Than the

lady called toguyder her counſaile to knowe
what ſhe were beſt to do / for ſhe knewe well
the duke was hote / haſty / and coragyous.
            THe ſame ſeaſone whyle this ladye
was takynge of counſayle with her
frendes / the Frenche kynge was defyed
by the duke of Guerles / wherof ranne
a great brute throughe all the Realme / and
in other realmes therto adioynyng. They
had marueyle of theſe newes / Bycauſe the
duke of Guerles was but a ſmall prince / to
the regarde of other / and but of ſmalle landes.
Men ſpake therof in dyuers maners / 
euery man after his own opynion: Than̄e
the ducheſſe counſayle ſayde. Madame / ye
haue nede of counſayle: And we ſhall counſayle
you to ſende to the Frenche kynge / and
to the duke of Burgoyne be tymes: For ye
haue herde howe the duke of Guerles hathe
defyed the Frenche kynge / and all his alyes.
If he be in purpoſe to make warre to the realme
of Fraunce / as the brute ronneth that
he wyll / bycauſe the Englyſſhemen and the
almaygnes are of his alyaunce: He can haue
no better entre in to the realme of Fraūce
than throughe youre countrey. Wherfore it
is good that the kynge and the duke of Burgoyne
be aduertyſed therof: And that youre
caſtels on the fronters be well fortifyed and
garnyſſhed. For there is nat ſo ſmall an ennemye / 
but he is to be doubted. We ſaye nat
that ye ſhulde haue great nede to ſeke for any
ayde or confore all onely for them of Guerles / 
but it is good to regarde the alyaunces / 
that he maye lightlye gette / as well of Englyſſhe
men as of almaygnes / who alwayes
are couetous / and deſyreth to make warre to
the realme of Fraunce on truſt of wynnyng.
Than the ducheſſe ſayd to her coūſayle. ſirs
ye ſaye trouthe / it ſhalbe as ye haue deuiſed.
Than ſuche as ſhulde go on that meſſage
were apoynted out: As the lorde of Bourguenall
cheife Stewarde of her houſe / ſir
Iohan Opeyn a gracyous knyght / a clerke
and a ſquyer of honoure. The clerke called
ſir Iohan Grane / and the ſquyer Nycholas
de la Monoy. All four were of the preuy coū
               ſayle
with the ducheſſe of Brabant. They departed
fro Bruſelles with letters of credēce
and rode to Parys. At that tyme nother the
kynge nor the duke of Burgoyne was natte
there / they were at Rohane in Normandye.
Than they went fro Parys to Roane where
the kynge was.
            WHan theſe ambaſſadoures came to
Rohane / firſte they treated with the
duke of Burgoyne and he made thē
good chere / for he knewe them well / they delyuered
letters to hym / and he receyued and
reed them. Than whā tyme was he brought
them to the kynge / who for loue of their lady
receyued thē louyngly. Than the kyng reed
their letters and herde them ſpeke / and aunſwered
and ſayde. Sirs / your wordes and
requeſtes demaundeth counſayle. Reſorte alwayes
to our vncle of Burgoyne & he ſhall
here you / and diſpatche youre buſyneſſe (as
ſhortely as maye be) Thoſe wordes contented
greatly theſe ambaſſadours / and ſo went
to their lodgynges. The kynge and his vncles
with other of his counſayle / were dayly
toguyder in counſaile for dyuers cauſes and
inſydentes newe fallen. The defyance of the
duke of Guerles was nothyng pleaſaunt to
them / nor alſo they knewe nat what the duke
of Bretayne was purpoſed to do / bycauſe he
had taken the conſtable of Fraunce priſoner / 
and ſet hym to raūſome to a .C.M. frankes / 
and had taken fro him thre caſtelles & a good
towne: and had greatly fortifyed with men / 
vitayls / and artyllary / all his garyſons and
townes / & had ſent dyuers tymes letters and
meſſangers in to Englande to the kyng and
to his vncles: As for the duke of Lancaſtre
was at that tyme in Galyce. The coūſayle of
Fraūce had moche a do to prouyde for euery
buſyneſſe / wherby it was the lengar or ye duches
of Brabantes ambaſſade had their anſwere.
Finally ye duke of Burgoyn made thē
an anſwere & ſayd. ſirs / ye ſhall retourne to
your lady our aunte & ſalute her fro vs / and
delyuer her theſe the kynges letters & ours. &
ſhewe her yt her buſineſſe is ours / and let her
nat be abaſſhed for any thyng / for ſhe ſhalbe
cōforted in ſuche wyſe / that ſhe ſhall well ꝑceyue
that her countre of Brabant ſhall take
no domage nor reproch. This fayre anſwere
contented greatly the ambaſſadours of Brabant.
Thus they departed & returned to Parys
and fro thēs to Bruſels / & made relacion
of their aunſwere (as ye haue herde before)
wherwith the duches was well content.
            
               
THe ſame ſeaſon newes were ſprede
abrode of holy ſaynt Peter of Luſenbourge
cardynall / whoſe body
dyde myracles in the cytie of Auygnon.
            This holy cardynall was ſonne to the Erle
Guye of ſant Poule / who dyed in the batayle
of Iulyers. This holy Cardynall in
his tyme was a good man / noble / holy / & deuoute
of lyfe / & dyde many dedes pleaſaūt to
god. He was ſwete / courteſſe / meke / and a
mayde of body: A great almeſſe man in gyaynge
to poore people. He kept nothynge to
hym ſelfe of the goodes of the Churche / but
his bare lyueng: The mooſt parte of the day
and of the nyght he was in his prayers / allwayes
he fledde fro the vanyties and ſuperfluyties
of the worlde / ſo that in his yonge
dayes god called hym to his company: And
anone after his diſceſſe he dyde great myracles / 
and ordayned to be buryed amonge the
poore people: All his dayes he vſed humylyte / 
and was buryed in the chapell of ſaynt
Mychaell. The Pope and the cardynalles
whan they ſawe the myracles that his body
dyde daylye encreaſe and multiplye: They
wrote to the Frenche kynge / and ſpeciallye
to his brother the Erle Valeranne of ſaynt
Poule: deſyringe hym to come to Auygnon.
The Erle wolde nat excuſe hym but wente
thyder / and there gaue goodlye Lampes of
ſyluer to hange before his aulter / and hadde
great marueyle of the great beleue and viſytacion
that the people made there dayly▪ and
for to ſe hym I wente thyder fro the countie
of Foize / and daylye his workes encreaſed
(and it was ſayde) that he ſhulde be canoniſed.
I can nat tell what fell after.
            ¶Nowe yt I haue ſhewed you of his dethe / 
I ſhall ſhewe you of the dethe of another / 
for I haue nat ſpoken of the dethe of a kyng
of whome great mencyon hath been made of
in this hyſtorie: Howe be it the dyde many
dedes vnreſonable / for by hym
and his meanes / the realme
of Fraūce had moche
to do in his
tyme.
This was by the kyng of Nauer.
         
         
            ¶Howe by a ſtraunge fortune the
kynge of Nauer dyed in the cytie of
Pampilona / and howe Charles his
ſonne was crowned: and howe Vā
               chadore
was beſeged by the duke of
Berrey: and howe the duke of Burgoyne
ſente to the ducheſſe of Brabant.
Capi. C.xvi.
            
               IT is ſayd: and it is of
trouthe / that there is nothyng
more certayne than
dethe. I ſaye it bycauſe yt
kynge of Nauer whan he
dyed / thought full lytell
that he had been ſo nere to
his ende as he was. If he had knowen therof / 
paraduenture he wolde haue taken better
hede than he dyde. He was in the cytie of Pā
               pylona
in Nauerre / He ymagined howe he
wolde reyſe a great taylage in his realme / to
the ſōme of two hundred thouſande florens / 
and he ſente for his counſayle and ſaid / howe
he wolde haue this money reyſed. His counſayle
durſte nat ſaye nay / for he was a cruell
prynce. Than the moſte notable perſones of
other cyties and townes in his realme were
ſente for / to come to Panpylona. They came
thyder / for they durſt nat diſobey. Whan they
were come all togyther in to the kynges palays / 
the kynge hym ſelfe declared forthe the
mater why they were ſent for. He was a king
ryght ſubtyle / ſage / and well langaged / and
at the concluſion ſayde / howe towardes his
nedes he muſt haue the ſōme of .CC.M. florens / 
to be reyſed of his ſubiectes / After this
maner. the riche to pay .x. frankes / the meane
to be ceſſed at fyue frankes / and all other at
one franke. This requeſt abaſſhed greatly
the people / for the yere before there had ben a
batayle in Nauer / by reaſon wherof a tayle
was rayſed to the ſomme of hundred thouſande
floreyns: And beſyde that he maryed
his doughter the lady Iane to duke Iohan
of Bretaygne / and a great parte of that money
as thā nat payde and vngadered. Whan
the kynge hadde made his demaunde / he deſyred
to haue an anſwere: Than they requyred
to take counſayle and to ſpeke toguyder.
The king gaue them reſpite .xv. dayes. than

the chefe of them to make anſwere. The brute
of this taylage ſpredde abrode through Nauerre / 
and euery man was a baſſhed therof.
At the .xv. dayes ende / the moſte notable perſones
of the good cyties and townes returned
to Panpilona / to the nombre of a threſcore perſones / 
who had charge to aunſwere for all the
hole realme. The kynge was preſent at their
anſwere makyng / whiche was done in a fayre
garden / farre of fro any people / and cloſed aboute
with hygh walles. Than they aunſwered
all with one accorde / and ſhewed the pouerte
of the realme / and alleged howe the former
tayle was nat as than all leuyed nor gadred / 
wherfore they beſought him for goddeſſake
to haue pytie of them / for they ſayd ſurely
the realme was nat able to beare it. and whan
the king ſawe that he coude nat eaſely attayne
to his purpoſe / he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and departed
fro them and ſayd. Sirs / ye are yuell
counſayled / take counſayle agayne / and ſpeke
yet agayne togyder. And ſo he went in to his
chambre / and his counſayle with hym. Than
all theſe good perſones were togyder in this
garden faſte cloſed in with hygh walles / and
the kynge commaunded in no wyſe to ſuffer
them to iſſue out / & to haue but lytell meate nor
drinke. Than they were there in great doute
of their lyues / and there was none that durſte
ſpeke for them. and ſo it was ſuppoſed that by
conſtreynt he had his deſyre / for he ſtrake of a
thre of their heedes / ſuche as were moſte contrary
to his entente to 
                  •
                gyue feare and enſample
to other. Than there fell a ſtraunge inſydence
by a marueylous ſodayne aduēture / the
whiche god ſent lyke a myracle. I ſhall ſhewe
you how / as I was enfourmed in the countie
of Foize at Ortays at the erles houſe / by men
of Panpylona / it paſt nat a thre or four dayes
iourney thence. It was ſhewed me howe this
kynge of Nauer in his dayes loued well women / 
and at the ſame tyme he had a fayre damoſell
to his louer / for he was a wydower a
longe ſeaſon. On a nyght he laye with her a
ſpace / and than retourned to his chambre in a
feuer / and ſayd to his ſeruauntes. Dreſſe my
bedde / for I wyll reſt me a ſeaſon / and ſo went
to his bed / and trymbled for colde / and coulde
take no heate. He was an aged man aboute a
threſcore yere of age / and of vſage his bedde
was wont to be chaſed with a baſon with hote
coles / to make hym ſwete / whiche often tymes
he vſed / and dyd hym no hurte. At this tyme
his ſeruaūtes dyd the ſame / but outher as god
wolde or the deuyll / a burnynge flame toke in
the ſhetes / in ſuche maner that or he coulde be
reſkewed he was brente to the bowels / he was
ſo wrapped bytwene the ſhetes. So that he
lyued fyftene dayes after in great payne and
myſery / inſo moche that phyſyke nor ſurgery
coulde helpe hym / but that he dyed. This was
the ende of the kynge of Nauerre. And ſo the
poore men of the countrey were quyte of their
taylage / and delyuered fro payenge there of
to Charles his ſonne / who was a noble good
knyght and a yonge / and was kynge of Nauerre / 
and crowned kynge the ſame ſeaſone
that I wrote this hyſtory / anone after the obſequy
done of his father / in the cytie of Paupylona.
            yE haue well herde here before of the
treatyes that hadde ben made in the
counties of Armynake and dolphenty / 
in Auuergne and Lymozyn / who were enemyes
to all their neyghbours. Many of them
were well content to departe / for they thought
they had warred and trauelled the realme of
Fraunce longe ynoughe / thynkynge than to
goo and robbe and pyll in other places. The
duke of Armynake promyſed theym to leade
them in to Lumbardy / But the erle of Foyze
who wolde nat lyghtly be dyſceyued thought
the contrary. He helde hym ſelfe ſtyll to ſe the
ende of that buſyneſſe / and euer dylygentely
enquyred / howe the treatyes wente forwarde
in thoſe parties / and whan theſe men of warre
ſhulde departe / and whyder they ſhuld drawe.
And the men of his countrey ſayde / that the
renome was / howe they wolde go and rynne
a bowfe a robbynge and pyllynge. Thanne
the Erle caſte downe his heed and ſayde. Alwayes
newes rynne amonge of warre. The
erle of Armynake & Bernarde his brother are
yonge / and I knowe well they loue me nat nor
my countrey. Theſe men of warre may happe
by his meanes to rynne on me and my countrey / 
howe be it I wyll prouyde there fore in
ſuche wyſe / that I truſte I ſhall take no domage.
It is ſayd / longe prouyſion before maketh
ſure poſſeſſyon. Thus the erle of Foyze
ſayde to his counſayle / and it was no folyſſhe
imagynacyon / as it apered after / if I maye

atteygne to the tretynge therof.
            yE haue herde here before reherſed / 
how Geffrey Tete noyr breton / who
hadde longe kepte the garyſon of the
ſtronge caſtell of Vandachor in Lymozyn / on
the fronter of Auuergne & Burbonoys / wolde
in no wyſe departe out of ye caſtell / for he helde
it as his owne propre enherytaunce / and had
patyſed all the countrey there aboute / and vnder
their pateſyng the people labored in peaſe
and reſte. Thus this Geffrey kepte the eſtate
of a greate lorde. He was a cruell man in his
dyſpleaſure / he hadde no more pytye to ſlee a
man than a beeſt. Nowe to come to purpoſe.
whan the tydinges ſpred abrode in Auuergne
and Lymozyn / of the tayle that was gathered
in the countreys / to the entente to a voyde out
of the countrey theſe men of warre. Than it
was brewted that the men of warre in the fortreſſe
of Vandachor ſhulde departe / & to gyue
vp the fortreſſe to the duke of Berrey. By reaſon
of that tydynges the people were contente
to pay this tayle. But whan they ſawe the contrary
(for the moſt hurte that they had / was by
them of the garyſon of Vandachor) thought
the money that they had payed at the firſt gatherynge
but loſte / and ſayd howe they wolde
paye no more croſſe nor mayle / without they
of Vandachor were conſtreyned to departe
out of the countrey. Theſe tydynges came to
the he
                  •
               yng of the duke of Berrey / who had all
the ſoueraygne charge of the countrey of Auuerge / 
Lymozyn / and Gelnadan. Than the
duke and his counſayle ſayde. Surely theſe
poore men haue good cauſe to ſaye ſo / and to
be lothe to pay their money for nothinge / and
more ouer ſayde / howe he hym ſelfe and his
counſayle were to blame / that they layde nat a
ſiege aboute that fortreſſe / to kepe them of that
garyſon fro iſſuyng out. Thanne the duke of
Berrey ordeyned at the coſt and charge of the
countrey foure hundred ſpeares of good men
of armes / to beſiege Vandachor by baſtydes.
And ſoueraigne capytaynes of that company
was ſyr Willyam of Lygnac and ſyr Iohan
Boeſme launce / a valyaunt knyght of Burbonoyſe.
Theſe men of armes and knyghtes / 
as nere as they myght layde ſiege to Vandochor / 
and made ba
                  •
               tydes in foure places / and
by men of the countrey they made great trenches
and defence vpon the ſtraytes, to ſtoppe
their iſſuinge out. But the capytayne Geffrey
ſet lytell therby / for he knewe well his gariſon
was well furnyſſhed with all maner of thynges / 
thoughe there came no newe vytayle to
them in ſeuen yere. Alſo the caſtell ſtode in ſo
ſtrong a place vpon a rocke / that it coude take
no domage for any aſſawte. And for all this
ſiege and baſtydes / they within wold often tymes
iſſue out by a preuy poſterne / whiche opened
bytwene two rockes / ſo that they wolde
iſſue out vnder couerte / and ryde abrod in the
countrey / and toke priſoners. Other thynge
they wolde bringe none to their fortreſſe / they
coulde nat bycauſe of the ſtrayte wayes / and
ſtronge mountaynes that they muſt paſſe by.
And this iſſue coulde nat be ſtopped fro them
for the aley vnder couert endured fro their garyſon
a ſeuen or eight leages / or they came out
in to the feldes / and whanne they retourned agayne / 
by that tyme they were entered a thre
leages / they were as ſure there as within their
caſtell. This maner they vſed a longe ſeaſon.
The ſiege laye more than a yere before the caſtell.
¶Nowe let vs leaue ſpekynge of Vandachor
tyll a nother ſeaſon / and ſpeke of other
newe maters.
            THe duke of Burgoyne forgate nat the
promiſe that he had made to his aunte
the duches of Brabante. He ordayned a foure
hūdred men of armes / burgonyons and other / 
and made two knyghtes capytayns / the one
ſir Guylliam of Tremoyle burgonyon / the other
ſir Geruays of Merande almayne. And
the duke ſayd to them. ſirs / ye ſhall go to your
charge on the fronters of Brabant and Guerles / 
there as the duches of Brabante wyll apoynt
you and make to her enemyes as good
warre as ye canne. The knyghtes ſayde they
ſhulde do their beſte / to fulfyll his commaundemente.
They made them redy and gadred
their men / and wente forthe as ſoone as they
myght / and drewe in to Brabante / and ſente
worde of their comynge to the duches of Brabante / 
and ſo paſſed through the lande of Luſenburge.
And than by the ordynaunce of the
marſhall of Brabant / they were ſente in to the
thre caſtels that the duke of Guerles chalēged
and wolde haue againe / bycauſe they had ben
layde but to pledge. that is to ſay / Buth / Gaulyth / 
& Nulle. There they helde them in garyſon
and made good fronter warre / & ſomtyme

rode abrode to encountre their enemyes. The
duke of Guerles fortefyed hym ſelfe agaynſte
them / and furnyſſhed his townes and caſtels
agaynſt them / for he ſawe well the warre was
as than open. So it fortuned that ſyr Willyam
of Tremoyle / deſyringe to auaunce hym
ſelfe to do ſome thynge that myght ſownde to
his honoure. He ſet his imagyncion on a day
on a towne in Guerles / a foure leages fro his
fortreſſe. this towne was called Seaulle / and
he ſhewed ſecretely his entenſyon to ſyr Geruays
of Merande his companyon / who lightly
accorded to his mynde. So they gathered
their company togyder and departed aboute
mydnyght / and rode a rounde paſe too this
towne / and had guydes that brought them to
Seaule / by that tyme it was daylight. Than
they reſted them & apoynted what they wolde
do. And as it was ſhewed me / ſyr Geruays
with .xxx. ſpeares / went on before for to wyn̄e
the gate / and ſir Willyam of Tremoyle to folowe
after / bycauſe they feared if they ſhulde
haue rydden all togyder to haue been ſpyed.
but they thought how they of the towne ſhulde
thynke none other / but that they ſhulde be a
certayne nombre of men of armes / ſent thyder
by the duke of Guerles to refreſſhe the garyſon.
Thus this knyght ſir Geruays with .xxx.
ſpeares rode before to the towne of Seaulle.
In the mornynge they founde men and women
goynge to the towne / for it was markette
day / they ſaluted theym in the langage of Almayne
and rode forthe. The poore men went
ſurely they had been men of the countrey perteynynge
to the duke of Guerles that were rydynge
to the garyſon. Syr Geruays and his
company rode forthe tyll they came to the gate
and founde it open with a ſmall warde / it was
ſo erly that the moſte parte of the people were
in their beddes. They reſted there and were
lordes of the gate. Than incontynent ſir Willyam
of Tremoyle and his route came galopynge
thyder as faſte as they myght / and entred
into the towne / & cryed their cryes. Thus
the towne was wonne without any defēce / for
the men of the towne thought full lytle that the
frēchmen wolde haue done ſuch an enterpriſe / 
and ye moſte parte of thē were in their beddes.
         
         
            ¶Howe the frenche men after they
had brente and ryfeled the towne of
Seaulle retourned to their garyſon / 
and of the ioy that the duke of Burgoyne
and the duches of Brabante
made for that dede / & howe ſir Iohn̄
Boeſme launce diſcomfyted the englyſſhmen.
Cap. C.xvii.
            
               THis enterpriſe was done on the
nyght of ſaynt Marten in wynter / 
and a thre dayes before there
came thyder a knyght of Englā
               de
with ten ſpeares and .xxx. archers / 
ſente by the kynge of Englande. This
knyght was called ſyr Guylliam Fykaole.
Whan the larum began he was ryſinge out of
his bed. He herde that the towne was wonne / 
and demaūded by whome. he was aunſwered
that it was done by bretons. Ah ꝙ the knight
bretons are yuell people / they wyll burne and
pyll the towne / & than departe. What crye do
they crye? ſyr ꝙ they / they crye on Tremoyle.
Than the englyſſhe knyght cloſed the caſtell / 
and helde hym ſelfe & his company within / to
ſe if any reſkewe came. but euery man was ſo
abaſſhed that they fled hyther & thyder. The
poore people fledde in to ye mynſter / and ſome
auoyded ye towne by another gate. the frenchmen
ſette fyre in the towne in dyuerſe places / 
howe be it there were many howſes of ſtone
and bricke / that ye fyre coulde nat lighty burne
them. The moſte parte of the towne was brent
pylled / and robbed / ſo that nothyng was lefte
that was good / & the rycheſt men of the towne
taken priſoners. The englyſſhe knyght was
taken at laſte / For whan he ſawe that all was
loſt he opened the howſe that he was in / for he
douted the fyre / whan he ſawe the flames and
ſmoke in euery corner of ye towne / and ſo came
out with his penon before hym and his company
archers and other / and there valiauntly
defended them ſelfes a longe ſeaſon. But fynally
he was taken and yelden priſoner to ſir
Guylliam of Tremoyle / and all his company
taken / but fewe ſlayne. Whan the frenchemen
had done their wylles with the towne of
Seaulle in Guerles / and their varlettes driuing
their pyllage before them they departed
for they thought it foly too a byde there / and
went to their gariſon fro whēce as they came.

Thus the duke of Guerles had the firſt buffet
and domage / wherwith he was ſore dyſpleaſed
whan he knewe therof. and ſo came thyder
with a great nombre of menne of warre / and
thought well to haue founde there the frenche
men / but they were gone. Than he newe renpayred
the towne and furniſhed it with newe
men of warre / who were more dilygēt to kepe
the towne / thanne they that were there before.
Thus daily the aduētures of warre fell / ſome
loſte one daye and ſome another. The duches
of Brabante / and all tho of her countrey were
gretly reioyſed of this aduenture / and ſir Gillyam
of Tremoyle / and ſyr Geruais of Merande
atchyued great grace. Than they of the
countrey ſayde / that in the nexte ſommer folowyng
they wolde wynne it agayne. Whan the
duke of Burgoyne herde theſe tydinges / and
howe that his men yt were in garyſon in Brabant
dyd well and valyauntly / he was gladde
therof / and to incorage theym he wrote pleaſaunt
letters often tymes to ſyr Guylliam his
knyght. Thus they taryed there all that wynter / 
kepinge well their fronters / & defendynge
them ſelfe fro domage. And after the caſtelles
and fortereſſes of Guerles / were better taken
hede vnto than they were before. Nowe ſhall
I ſhewe you of another enterpriſe / that Perote
of Bernois dyde in Auuergne / where he
gate gret profite / and by what meanes he dyd
it I ſhall ſhewe we you at lenght.
            IT fortuned the ſame yere and ſeaſon aboute
the tyme of the myddes of Maye / 
a .xl. companyons aduenturers iſſued out of
Caluſet / the whiche Perot of Bernoys helde.
This fortreſſe ſtode in Lymozyn. Theſe companyons
rode forthe at aduenture in to Auuergne / 
and a Gaſcoyne ſquyer was their capytayne / 
called Geronet Durante / an experte
man of armes. And bycauſe the countrey was
alwayes in doute of ye men of warre that were
on the fronters of Burbonoys / there was a
knyght of the duke of Burgoynes / called ſyr
Iohan Boeſme Launce / a gracyouſe and an
amorous knyght / hauynge great corage to auaunce
hymſelfe. Whyle theſe englyſſhe men
rode a brode / he deman̄ded what nombre they
were of. And it was ſhewed hym howe they
were aboute a .xl. ſpeares. What quod he / it is
lytell to regarde for .xl. ſpeares / I wyll ſet as
many againſt them. and ſo departe fro thence
as he was as than / and went there as his chefe
charge was / and that was before Vandachor
He gate togyder. a .xl. or a fifty ſpeares of Lymozyn
and Auuergne / and Burbonoyſe / and
with hym there was a knyght called ſir Loys
Dambter / and alſo ſir Loys Dabton / and the
lorde of ſaynte Obyſe. And ſo toke the feldes
without kepyng of any high way / they knewe
the countrey / & came to a paſſage where their
enemyes muſte nedes paſſe / by reaſone of the
mountaynes and ryuers whiche were greate
and depe / by occaſion of the ſnowe fallyng fro
the mountayns. They had nat ben there halfe
an hour / but that thenglyſſhment came thyder
and was nat ware of that rencountre. Than
Boeſme launce and his cōpany / cauched their
ſpeares and came agaynſt their enemyes and
cryed their cryes. whan the engliſſhment ſawe
howe they muſt nedes fight / they turned their
faces to their enemyes / & defended them ſelfe.
There was a ſore rencountre / and certayne ouer
throwen on bothe partyes. But to ſay the
trouth the frenchmen were better expert men
of armes than the auenturers / and that ſemed
well / for there were none of the aduenturers
that returned agayne without it were the varlettes / 
who fledde and ſaued them ſelfe whyle
other dyd fyght. There were .xxii. taken and
ſyxtene ſlayne on the place / and the capitayne
taken priſoner. and thus they departed.
         
         
            ¶Howe ſyr Iohan Boeſme launceled
theſe priſoners to Moūte Ferant
and howe they of the countrey were
glad whan they herde of this enterpriſe / 
and howe Generot & his company
were ſette to raunſome and delyuered
by the money that Perot of
Bitrne lente hym. Cap. C.xviii.
            
               IN rydyng & ledynge
theſe pryſoners / Boeſme
lauce aduyſed and remembred
hymſelfe howe that a
moneth before he had ben
in the towne of Mount ferante
in Auuergne / ſportyng
amonge the ladyes and damoſels there / 
and howe they hadde deſyred hym at a tyme / 

ſayeng. Fayre brother Boeſme launce / ye ryde
often tymes abrode in to the feldes. may it nat
ſo fortune yt at ſomtyme ye myght rencounter
your enemyes? I ſhall ſhewe you why quod
one of the damoſels (ſuch one as was in great
fauoure with Boeſme launce) Syr quod ſhe / 
I wolde fayne ſe an englyſſhman? aſquyer of
this countrey called Gurdines / hathe ſhewed
me often tymes howe the englyſſhmen are experte
men of armes / the whiche ſemeth ryght
well to betrewe / for they ryde often tymes abrode / 
and do many propre deades of armes / 
and taketh dyuerſe of our caſtels / and kepeth
them. At whiche tyme this gētleman Boeſme
launce anſwered her and ſayd. Dame / if euer
it be my fortune to take any / ye ſhall ſe hym.
Syr I thanke you quod the damoſell. Thus
after the foreſayde enterpriſe / whan this promyſe
came in to his mynd / he forſoke than the
way to Cleremonte / whiche was nat farre of / 
and tourned to the way to Mountferant / nat
farre thence. Of his comyng to Mountferant
and of the iourney yt he had atchyued agaynſt
the aduenturers (who ſore troubled the countrey)
all the people of Moūtferant were right
ioyfull / and made hym good chere. Than he
toke his lodgynge and vnarmed hym / the ladyes
and damoſels came to make hym chere / 
and receyued him ryght ſwetly / he was a ſage
knyght. Than he thanked them / and ſayde to
her that had deſyred hym before to ſe ſome englyſſe
man. Dame / I wyll acquyte me to you
I made you promyſe nat paſt a moneth a go / 
that if it myght be my fortune to take any englyſſhe
man / to ſhewe hym to you / and as this
day god hath gyuen me ye grace to mete with
ſome that be ryght valyant / for in armes they
haue gyuen vs ynoughe to do / howe be it we
hadde the victory. They be no englyſſhe men
naturally borne / they be gaſcoyns / and make
warre for the englyſſhmen. they be of Byerne
and hyghe Gaſcoyne / ye ſhall ſe them at good
leyſer / for the loue of you I haue brought them
to this towne / and he
                  •
                they ſhall remayne tyll
their raūſomes be payed. The ladyes and damoſelles
laughed at him / and tourned the mater
to a great ſporte / and ſayd to hym. Sir / all
we thanke you. And ſo there he taryed a thre
dayes amonge them / & he kept good company
with his priſoners / and put them to raunſome
for he ſawe well they were but poore companyons
aduenturers / and he thought it were
better to hange them / drowne them / or raunſome
them / rather thanne to ſuffre ſo many of
them to abyde ſtyll in the towne. And ſo whan
he departed thence he ſayd to Geronet. Syr / 
ye ſhall abyde here with a certayne / for all the
reſte of your company / and the other ſhall departe
and go ſeche your raunſome / And that
ye ſhall paye / I ſhall apoynte them that ſhall
receyue it / and whanne the money is payed ye
ſhall departe. Therfore remembre well nowe
what I do for you? if any of ours herafter hap
to be in lyke caſe / do in lykewyſe. Syr quod
Geronet / I am bounde ſo to do / and ſo we be
all. Thus Boeſme launce departed / and retourned
agayne to the ſyege of Vandachor.
And a twelue of the pryſoners taryed ſtyll in
Mounteferante / and the other departed and
went to Galuſet / to Perot of Bernois to haue
of hym .xxii. hundred frankes. They that taryed
ſtyll at Moūtferant lay and made good
there / and no great watche layde on them / but
they went vp and downe in the towne at their
pleſure / and ſo were there a fyftene dayes / and
in that ſeaſon they lerned moche of the ſtate of
the towne / the whiche coſt after a hūdred thouſande
frankes.
            WHan the capytayne of Galuſet was
infourmed of the aduenture of Gere
not of Mandurant / how that he and
his company were ouer throwen by ſir Iohan
Boeſme launce / he made lytell therof / and ſaid
to theym that came to hym for the money for
their raūſomes. Syrs / ye are come for money
for their delyueraunce / howe ſaye ye it is nat
ſo? yes truely ſir quod they / we truſt they ſhall
nat be alwayes in this loſſe / they haue no gages.
well ſirs quod he / as for me I nother care
for their pledges nor yet for their loſſes / they
ſhall haue nothynge of me. I made them nat
to go for the / they rode at their owne aduēture / 
therfore ye may ſhewe them / let aduenture delyuer
them. Thynke you that I wyll enploye
my money after that ſorte? nay ſurely. I canne
haue alwayes cōpanyons ynowe to ryde more
ſagely than they dyd. As forme I wyll quyte
out no man / without he be taken in my company.
This was the fynall anſwere that they
coulde gette for Geronet. Than they ſayde amonge
themſelfe / it were beſt that two or thre
of vs retourne agayne to Geronet / and ſhewe
him all the caſe. So thre of them retourned to

Mountferante / and as they rode they paſſed
by Cleremoūt / and ſawe well the walles were
nat of no great heyght. Than they ſayd one to
another. this towne is prignable / if we come
hyder on a nyght we maye gette it / there is no
great watche kepte. We muſte one tyme bargayne
and another tyme bye / we can nat both
bargayne and bye all in one daye. Thus they
rode forthe and rode to Mountferante / and
there founde Geronet and his companyons / 
and there ſhewed him all the anſwere that they
had of Perot of Bernoys / wherof they were a
baſſhed / for they wyſte nat howe nor where to
gette their raunſome. Thus all a daye and a
nyght they were in great dyſpleaſure. the next
daye Geronet ſayde to them that had brought
thoſe newes. Syrs / I requyre you retourne
agayne to our capytayne / and ſhewe hym fro
me yt I haue to my power whyle I was with
hym / ſerued him truely / and wyll do yet if it be
his pleaſure. And ſhewe hym if I tourne and
become Frenche to delyuer my ſelfe / he ſhall
wyn but lytell therby. And if I do it god knoweth
it ſhall be full ſore agaynſt my wyll / and
I ſhall forbeare it as longe as I canne. And
ſhewe hym that if he wyll nowe delyuer vs fro
hence / that within a moneth after I ſhal bring
hym to ſuche a botye / that he and his company
ſhall wynne a hundred thouſande frankes.
With that meſſage the thre companyons retourned
agayne to Galuſet / and ſhewed Perot
their meſſage. Thanne he ſtudyed a lytell
and ſayd. It maye well be as he ſayeth / at aduenture
I ſhall delyuer him incontyuent. and
ſo opened a cofer wherin was more than threſcore
thouſande frankes / nat gathered of his
rentes that he hadde in Byerne / but the moſte
parte of pyllage. For the towne he dwelte in be
fore the warres was but of twelue houſes / and
the erle of Foiz was chefe lorde therof / and the
towne was called Dadam / within thre leages
of Ortays. Than he tolde oute .xxii. hundred
frankes / at a pynch a frende is knowen / I ſhall
put them in aduenture / he is well able to wyn
them agayne and mo / and he wyll. Thus they
departed fro Galuſet & retourned to Mount
ferante / it was a .xiiii. great leages bytwene / 
but they had a good ſauecōduct / wherby they
paſſed in and out without daunger.
            Whan Geronet knewe howe he and his company
ſhuld be delyuered / he was right ioyfull
and ſente for them that ſhulde receyue the money
and ſayde. Syrs / holde tell your money / 
here is all that we owe you. So they tolde out
xxii. hundred frankes. Than they rekened for
their expenſes in their lodgynges / and payed
euery thynge with the largeſte / ſo that euery
man was contente. And whan all was payed / 
than Gerenot hyred men and horſes to bringe
theym to Galuſet. Whan ſyr Iohan Boeſme
launce was certifyed of the receyte of the money / 
I thynke he dyd ſende for it / or els lefte it
ſtyll there on truſt of the ſtrength of the garyſon.
For the ſame ſeaſon ſir Peter of Gyache / 
as than chauncellour of Fraunce / left the
                  •
                his
treaſoure / the whiche he loſt the ſame yere all / 
or moſt parte. Whan Geronet was retourned
to Galuſet / the companyons made hym good
chere / and after a thre or foure dayes Perot le
Bernoys called hym and ſayde. Geronet / the
promyſe that ye made to my ſeruantes was
cauſe of your delyueraunce / and nothyng els / 
for I was nat boūde to paye your raunſome / 
ſeynge ye departed without my leaue / ye rode
forthe but at aduenture / therfore nowe holde
your promyſe / or els there ſhall be diſpleaſure
bytwene you and me / for I wold ye knowe I
haue nat lerned to leſe / but rather to wynne.
Capytayne quod Geronet / ye haue reaſon to
ſay as ye do / and ſir I ſaye thus to you that if
ye lyſte I ſhall ſet you in the towne of Mount
ferant within .xv. dayes / in the whiche towne
is great treaſure and pyllage / for it is ryche of
marchaundyſe / and ryche villaynes be therin
great plenty. the chauncellour of Fraunce ſyr
Peter of Giache / as it is infourmed me / hathe
great ryches within the ſame towne. And I
knowe well it is the towne moſt ſympleſt kept
and leſte taken hede to of any towne in the realme.
Syr this is that I can ſaye / and this is
the promyſe that I haue made. In the name
of god quod Perot le Bernoys / it is well ſayd
and I conſente therto / ye knowe well the maner
of the towne / and howe it is kepte and fortifyed.
This enterpriſe dothe it requyre any
great nombre? Syr quod Geronette / a thre or
four hundred ſpeares ſhall well accomplyſſhe
our feate / for within the towne there be no men
of great defence. Well quod Perot I am contente / 
and I ſhall ſingnyfye other capytayns
of the fortreſſes here aboute of the mater / and
we ſhall aſſemble to gyder and go thyder.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe Geronet of Mandurante
with twelue of his company retourned
to Mountferant / and howe Perot
of Bernoys with foure hundred
ſpeares went to Mount ferant / and
wolde nat entre in to the towne by
none other waye but in at the gate.
Cap. C.xix.
            
               ON this determynacion
Perot ſent to the capytaynes
nexte aboute hym / 
and apoynted euery man
to mete at Ouſac / a caſtell
in the byſſhopriche of Cleremount / 
nat farre thence.
Wherof ſomtyme Barbe a great pyller a gaſcoyne
was capytayne. The companyons of
ſeuen fortreſſes aſſembled togyder at Ouſac
englyſſhe men / and they were a four hundred
ſpeares well mounted / and than they had but
ſixe leages to ryde. The firſt that came to Ouſac
was Perote of Bernoys / to ſhewe that it
was his enterpriſe / and to take coūſayle with
the other capytayns / by the aduyſe of Geronet
and accordyng to the informacyon that he
had gyuen hym. Than Geronet and a twelue
other with hym / arayed theym lyke rude vyllayne
marchauntes in cotes of fryſe / and ledde
horſes tyed one to another with baggage on
them / accordynge to the cuſtome of the countrey.
And thus they departed fro Ouſac in the
brekynge of the daye / and ſo rode towardes
Mountferant / and lyke marchauntes they entred
into the towne about noone. There were
none that toke any hede what men they were / 
they thought full lytell they hadde ben men of
warre. They of the towne demed ſurely they
had ben marchaūtes / come thyder to the fayre
to haue bought cloth and dyaper / for they ſaid
they came fro Mounte Pellier / to bye marchaūdyſe
for againſt the fayre there was come
thyder moche marchaundyſe fro other cyties
and townes of the realme. Than Geronet and
his company wente to their lodgynge / to the
ſyne of the Crowne / and ſette vp their horſes
and toke vp a fayre chambre for thē / and kepte
theym ſtyll therein without goynge aboute in
the towne for feare of ſpyenge / and ſo ſate and
made mery / and thought well they wolde pay
nothynge for their expenſes.
            AT nyght they were beſy to dreſſe their
horſes and ſaid to their hoſt and oſtes / 
that their horſes hadde ſore trauayled all that
day / wherfore they had nede of reſt. They prouyded
them of plenty of candels / and ſo went
in to their chambre and dranke and made mery / 
but they wolde nat go to bed. So the hoſt
and the hoſtes wente to their beddes and lette
them alone / and had no ſuſpecte of them. Now
ſhall I ſhewe you what Perot and his company
dyd. The ſayd day he and with hym ſeuen
other capytayns / firſte Perot le Bernoys
as chefe / than the Bourge of Compaygne called
Arnaldon / the bourge Anglois / ye Bourge
of Carlat / Apthon Seguyn / Olyue Barbe / &
Bernadon of the iſles / & with them there was
a great routter of Byerne the lorde of Launce
playne. By hym and by the bourge of Compayne
I was afterwarde enfourmed of this
enterpriſe / whiche was done aboute Candelmas / 
whan the nightes be long and colde. and
all the ſame nyght it rayned / and the wynde
blewe ſo that it was a ſtormy ſeaſon / wherfore
the capytayne of the watche of Mountferant
iſſued nat out that nyght of his lodgynge / but
he ſent his ſonne forthe who was but yonge / of
a ſyxtene yere of age. And as he wente fro the
one gate to the other / he foūde four poore men
watchinge / nygh deed for colde / and they ſayd
to the yonge man. Syr / take of eche of vs a
blanke / and let vs go home and warme vs / it
is paſte a leuen of the clocke. The yonge man
coueted the money and toke it / and they departed
fro their watche / and wente to their owne
houſes. Than Geronet and his company watched
at their hoſtes dore / to ſe whan the watch
men ſhulde retourne. Than they ſawe whan
the yonge man came fro the watche / and the
watche men with hym. Than Geronet ſayde / 
the mater goeth well / this is lyke to be a good
nyght for vs / euery manne in the towne is as
nowe gone to bedde / the watche is paſte / we
nede to take no care for that. And on the other
parte / I am ſure Perotte le Bernoys and his
company are rydynge hyder warde as faſt as
they may. And in dede ye ſame tyme they were
comynge and came nere to Cleremounte / and
mette with Aymergotte Marcell with a hundred
ſperes / capytayne of the fortreſſe of Aloſe

beſyde ſaint Floure. whan eche of them knewe
other they made good chere / and demaunded
eche other whyder they wolde / and what they
ſought in that countrey. Amergot aunſwered
and ſaid / I come fro my fortreſſe of Aloſe / and
ame goynge to Carlate. In the name of god
ſayd two of the capytaynes / the Bourge Angloys
and the Bourge Compaigne. Sir we
be here / wolde ye any thynge ſpeke wyth vs?
yea quod Amerigot / ye haue certayne pryſoners
of the countre of Dolphyn of Auuergne / 
and ye knowe well we be in treatynge togyther
by the meanes of the erle of Armynake / 
wherfore we wold gladly make an exchaunge
with certayne priſoners that I haue in my garyſon.
I am ſore deſyred thus to do by the coū
               tes
of Dolphyn / who is a right good lady and
is well worthy to be done pleaſure vnto. than
the Bourge of Compaigne ſayd. Aymergotte
ye are greatly bounde to do ſome pleaſure to
that lady / for within this thre yere ye hadde of
her ſyluer thre hundred frankes / for the redemynge
of the caſtell of Mercyer. But ſyr / I
pray you where is therle Dolphyn at this ſeaſon?
Syr quod the other / it is ſhewed me that
he is in Fraunce / comunynge vpon the treatie
that ye know that we be in hande with the erle
of Armynake / and with erle Dolphyn. Than
Perot le Bernoys ſayde. Sir / leaue thir comunynge
and come on with vs / and it ſhall be
for your profyte. and ye ſhall haue parte of our
botye. Sir quod. Aymergot / and whyder go
you than? By my fayth ſir quod Perot / we go
ſtreyght to Mount ferante / for this nyght the
towne ſhall be yelden to me. than Aymerygot
ſayd. ſyr / this is yuell done that ye go aboute / 
for ye knowe well we be in treatie with the erle
of Armynake and with this coūtrey / wherfore
all townes and caſtels rekeneth themſelfe halfe
aſſured / wherfore we ſhall be greatly blamed
thus to do / and ye ſhall breke out treatye. By
my faythe quod Perot / as for me I wyll agre
to no treatye / as longe as I maye kepe the feldes / 
it behoueth companyons to lyue. come on
your way with vs / for ye ſhall haue nothynge
to do at Carlat / for here be the companyons of
that fortreſſe / and ſuche as be left behynd wyll
nat ſuffre you to entre till their company come
home. Well 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                quod Aymerigot / with you wyll
I nat go / but I wyll returne agayne in to my
fortreſſe / ſyth the mater is thus. Thus they de
parted one fro a nother. Perot helde the waye
to Mountferant / and whan they were vnder
Cleremount there they reſted them / and imagyned
on a newe enterpriſe / ſpecially certayne
of the gaſcoyns / who knewe nat of the enterpriſe
of Geronet. Than they ſayd to the capytayns.
Sirs / beholde here this cytie of Cleremonte / 
the whiche is a ryche cytie / and rather
more prignable than Mount ferant / we haue
ladders here / let vs ſcale it / we ſhall haue more
profyte here than at Mount ferante. To this
poynte they were nere a greed / but thanne the
chefe capytayns ſayd. Sirs Cleremonte is a
puiſſant towne and well peopled and the men
well harneſſed / if they be ones moued they wyl
aſſemble togyther and put theym ſelfe to defēce.
it is no doute but we ſhulde haue no great
aduaunatage by them. And if we ſhulde be reculed
perforce and our horſe taken or loſte / we
ſhulde yuell eſcape / for we be farre fro home.
and if the coūtrey than ſhulde ryſe and purſue
vs / we ſhulde be in great daunger. we thynke
it were better to go on forthe and folowe our
fyrſt enterpriſe / for the ſekynge of a newe enterpriſe
per aduenture myght coſt vs dere.
            THis counſayle was taken / and ſo rode
forthe without makynge of any noyſe / 
ſo that aboute .xi. of the clocke they were nere
to Mount ferant. Whan they ſawe the towne
they ſtode ſtyll a thre bowe ſhot of fro ye towne.
Than Perotte ſayde / beholde here is Mount
ferant / our company that went before are with
in the towne. kepe you all ſtyll here cloſe to gyder / 
and I wyll go downe this valaye to ſe if
I may ſe or here any newes of Geronet / who
hathe brought vs to this enterpryſe / and departe
nat tyll I come to you agayne. ſir quod
they go your waye / we ſhall abyde you here.
Therwith Perot departed & four with hym.
The wether was ſo darke that no man coulde
ſe an acre brede fro hym / and alſo it rayned / 
blewe and ſnewe / that it was a meruaylouſe
yuell wether. Geronet was as than on the walles
and taryed to here ſome newes. He loked
dowe ouer the walles / and as he thought he
ſawe the ſhadowe of ſome men goynge a long
by the dyke ſyde. than he began a lytle to why / 
ſtell ſoftely. And whā they without herde that
they came nerer to the wall / for the dykes on
that ſyde hadde no water. Than Geronet demaūded
who was there without. Perot knew
his voyce and ſayd / I am Perot le Bernoys / 

Geronet art thou there? yea ſir quod he I am
here. Make you redy and aproche your men / 
for I ſhall lette you in here in to the towne / for
all tho within the towne be a ſlepe in their beddes.
What quod Perot / ſhulde we entre here
where as ye ſtande / god kepe me fro that? I
wyll nat entre there / if I entre I wyll entre in
at the gate / and at none other place. No wyll
quod Geronette / and I aſſure you that lyeth
nat in my power to do. but ſyr bring your ladders
hyder and ſpare nat ſckale / for I aſſure
you there is none ſhall let you. Well quod Perot / 
thou haſte promyſed to lette me in to the
towne / but ſurely I wyll nat entre without it
be by the gate. Well quod Geronet and I can
nat a mende it / for I can nat lette you in at the
gate / it is faſte ſhytte / and the kepers be within / 
but they be a ſlepe. Whyle they were at this
ſtryfe certayne of Geronettes cōpany within
went vp & downe vpon the walles / to ſe if they
myght here any noyſe. A lytell there by there
was a poore houſe at the foote of the wall / this
howſe ſtode alone farre of fro any other houſe / 
and a poore man dwelte therin a taylour / who
had watched all the nyght tyll the ſame tyme / 
and thanne was goynge to bedde. And as the
wynde caryeth noyſe farre of / he herde as he
thought men ſpekynge on the walles. For by
nyght tyme a man ſhall here farre of. therwith
he wente out of his howſe and wente vpon the
walles / and ſo met with the men / and as ſoone
as he ſawe them he began to crye. Than one
of them ſtept forthe and toke him by the throte / 
and ſayd. Vyllayne thou arte but deed & thou
ſpeke one worde? And ſoo he helde his peace / 
for he feared dethe. Than Geronet (who had
herde the noyſe) ſayde. Sirs ſlee hym nat / for
he ſhall do vs good ſeruyce / god hath ſent him
to vs / for by hym we ſhall furnyſſhe all our enterpriſe.
Than Geronet ſayde to Perotte le
Bernoys. ſyr / retourne to your company / and
whan ye here the fyrſt gate open come forthe / 
and with youre axes breke downe the gate
next you / and ſhewed him the aduenture
of the man that they had taken on
the walles. Thanne Perot
departed and wente to
his company / and
ſhewed them
all the
mater (as ye haue
herde before)
         
         
            ¶Howe Geronet lette in Perot le
Bernoys and his company in to the
towne of Mountferant / wherof the
countrey was a frayde / and howe
the kynge and his vncles beynge at
Parys were therwith ſore dyſpleaſed / 
and alſo the erle Dolphyn of Auuergene.
Cap. C.xx.
            
               THan Geronet ſayd to
the man yt they had taken.
Without thou fulfyll oure
deſyre thou arte but deed
incontynente. What wolde
you that I ſhulde do quod
he. I wyll quod Geronet
that thou go to the gate and a wake the porters / 
and ſay howe the capytayne wolde haue
the gate opened / or els let them delyuer to the
the keys / to lette in a certayne marchauntes of
Mounte Pellyer / who be without with fardelles
of marchandyſe to come in to the fayre.
Sirs quod the man / What and they wyll nat
byleue me. yes I warante the quod Geronet / 
tell theym by the token that he was nat at the
watche this laſt night / but ſent his ſonne. And
without thou do this meſſage well and wyſely
I ſhall ſlee the with my dagger / and do ſo that
through thy faute I leſe nat myne enterpriſe.
Whan the poore man ſawe howe he was manaſſed / 
and perceyued howe they were redy to
ſlee him / he was ſore abaſſhed / and ſayd. Sir
I ſhall do that ye cōmaunde / to the vttermeſt
of my power. And ſo he came to the gate and
knocked ſo longe tyll he a woke the porters.
Than they ſayd: What arte thou that wakeſt
vs this tyme of the nyght? I am ſuche a one
quod he / and named his name / I haue ben all
this nyght buſy in makyng of certayne geare
of the capytayns / and ſo haue borne it home / 
and whyle I was there / worde came to hym
howe certayne marchauntes of Mount Pellier
are without the gate with their marchandyſe / 
and are ſore trauayled and weate with
the fowle wether / wherfore the capitayne commaundes
you by me to open the gates and let
them come in / or els gyue me the keyes and I
ſhall let them in / by the ſame token that he was
nat at the watche him ſelfe this nyght / but ſent

his ſonne. That is trewe ꝙ the porters abyde
a lytell / thou ſhalt haue the keyes incontynent.
Than one of them roſe and toke the keys hanginge
on a pyn / and opened a lytell wyndowe
and delyuered out the keyes. The man toke
theym And than incontynente Geronet toke
them / and at aduenture put in the right key in
to the locke and opened ye gate / and than went
to the vtter gate / but in no wyſe he coulde open
it. Perot and his company were without
taryenge for openynge of the gate. Than Geronet
ſayd / ſirs helpe your ſelfe / auaunce forth
for I can in no wyſe open this ſeconde gate / 
breke it vp with your axes / otherwyſe ye can
nat entre in to the towne. Than they without
had redy axes and wedges and hewed ye gate
lyke carpenters. And as ſoone as they coulde
gette in a hole they put in axes and wedges to
Geronet / that he and his company ſhuld hewe
a ſonder the barres of the gate. Than dyuerſe
men herynge that noyſe aroſe out of their beddes / 
and had meruayle what it myght be / for
they thought full lytell that the englyſſhe men
ſhuld haue reyſed them out of their beddes / at
that tyme of the night. Than the kepers of the
gate who had yuell kept their warde / herynge
men ſpeke and horſes braye and crye / knewe
well they were dyſceyued / and roſe and came
to the wyndowes of the gate / and beganne to
cry with an hygh voyce / trayſon tray
                  •
               on. than
all the towne began to ryſe in great feare / and
many thought to ſaue their goodes and them
ſelfe and fledde to the caſtell / but the
                  •
                were but
a fewe that entred. For the Chatelyn within
the caſtell whanne he vnderſtode that the englyſſhe
men had wonne the towne / for feare of
leſynge of more / he wolde nat lette downe his
bridges. Some of his frendes that came firſt
he lette them come in by meanes of a planke / 
And whanne he herde the great brewte in the
towne / than he drewe in a gayne the planke / 
and after that he wolde no more put it forthe / 
but wente aboute to ſe what defence he ſhulde
make if the caſtell were aſſayled. thus I haue
ſhewed you howe the fyrſte gate was opened / 
and the ſecond broken with axes and wedges / 
and than they entred fayre and eaſely. Theſe
capytayns and their companyons or they entred
in to any houſe / they rode all the ſtreates
in the towne togyther / to ſe if there were any
aſſemble to make any defence. And whan they
had ſertched euery place / and founde no man
to make any reſiſtence / but a certayne ſuche as
were gone to haue entred into the caſtell made
a lytell defence / but ſoone they were taken and
ſlayne. What ſhulde I make longe proceſſe / 
Thus the towne of Mounte Ferante in Auuergne
was taken on a thurſday at nyght / the
thyrtenth day of February / by Perot le Bernoys
and his company? And whan they ſawe
howe they were lordes of the towne they toke
vp their lodgynges at their eaſe / without ſettynge
of any houſe a fyre / or doynge of any other
vyolence. For Perot le Bernois had charged
on payne of dethe no man to vyolate any
maner of woman or mayden / nor to ſette any
houſe a fyre / nor to take no good nor priſoner
lytell nor greate / tyll he had fyrſte knowledge
therof. And alſo / that no man ſhulde be ſo hardy
to hurte any churche or trouble any man of
the churche / nor to take any thynge out therof.
This maner euer Perot vſed whan ſo euer he
wanne any towne or fortreſſe. But Geffary
Tele noyre dyd always the contrarye / for he
neuer cared for churche nor for nothynge els / 
ſo that he myght haue it and get good / he cared
nat howe.
            THe ſame mornynge whanne tydinges
of this dede came to the knowledge of
them of Cleremounte / whiche was but a ſmall
leage thens / they were ſore abaſſhed and good
cauſe why / for their enemyes were nere them.
They wyſte nat what to ſaye or do / but toke
good bede to defende their towne. Theſe newes
ſpredde a brode to the caſtell Neuffe / to
Thyon / to Vyc / to Iſſoire / to Ryon / and fro
thence to Auige Perſe / & to caſtell of Mounte
Pencyer. And all theſe townes and countreys
that I haue named / the moſte parte pertayned
to the duke of Berrey. In farre countreys
theſe tydynges ſpred a brode / howe theſe englyſſhe
men and gaſcoyns had wonne and taken
the good towne of Mount ferante in Auuergne.
As many as herde therof meruayled
greatly / and were in doute / and the countreys
adioyning were halfe a frayde / as Auuergne / 
Burbonoys / Foreſtes / and to Berrey. Whan
theſe newes came to Parys the kyng and his
vncles were ſore diſpleaſed / whiche was good
reaſon / for the ſame tyme the erle Dolphyn
was at Parys for the orderynge of that countrey / 
for he hadde the ſoueraygne charge of

kepynge therof / with the erle of Armynake.
Therfore this dede was greatly to their diſpleaſure / 
for they thought they ſhulde beare
ſome blame for that dede / bycauſe it was vnder
their rule: But their excuſe was reaſonable / 
for it was well knowen howe they were
in treatie with all the companions / wherfore
they thought the countre at that tyme hadde
ben in good ſuretie. Than incontynent the
erle Dolphyn departed fro Parys to go in
to Auuergne / to ſette an order in the countre
and lefte all his trayne behynde hym: And ſo
rode but alonely with his page / and toke his
waye by Moulyns in Burbonoyes to go to
Auuergne / and chaunged euery daye freſſhe
horſes. And as he rode in this haſte at ſaynt
Pier the mynſter he herde other tidynges / yt
he hadde nat herde before / as I ſhall ſhewe
you.

            ¶Howe Perot le Bernoys and his
company toke their coūſaile and determyned
nat to kepe the towne of
Mountferante: and howe the ſayde
Perot and his cōpany deꝑted thens
by night with all their pyllage & priſoners / 
and went and refreſſhed thē
in the towne of Ouſac. Cap. C.xxi.
            
               WHan it was Fridaye
mornynge after the towne
was wonne on the thurſdaye
at nyght (as ye haue
herde here before) and that
theſe Capitayns were lordes
of the towne they boū
               de
faſte all the men / ſo that they coude do thē
no dommage. Than they ſertched all aboute
and truſſed in to fardelles: Clothe / naprye / 
gownes / furres / and other thynges / ſuche as
they thought to haue any profite by. And thā
they toke coūſayle whether they ſhulde kepe
ſtyll the towne or no. Some were of the opynion
to kepe it ſtyll and to fortifye it: But
the mooſt parte ſayde / that to abyde there it
were great follye / For ſo they ſhulde be encloſed
rounde about / and ſhulde be farre of
fro their ſocours & fortreſſes / ſo that if they
ſhulde be there beſieged / they ſhulde nat be
able to withſtande their ennemyes and lykely
to haue no ſocours / ſo that by longe ſiege
they ſhulde be famyſſhedde / for there aboute
were many great gentylmen / cyties & good
townes. And alſo whan the duke of Berrey
ſhulde knowe of this enterprice / he wyll ſēde
hyther the mareſhall of Fraunce ſir Loyes
Sanxere. And alſo the erle Dolphyn of Auuergne
and the erle of Armynake wyll come
or ſende and beſiege vs / with many great lordes:
As the lorde of the Towre / the lorde Dapthon / 
the lorde Dapthyer / the lorde of Reuell / 
the lorde de la Palayes / and dyuers other.
yea / and ſpecially hyther ſhall come ſir
Iohan Boeſme Launce with a great nōbre.
All theſe doutes the ſage Perot le Bernoyes
and Olyue Barbe dyde caſt and cōiecte / and
ſayde. If they were there taken they ſhulde
leſe all they haue / and fayne to delyuer vp all
their fortreſſes. So theſe capitayns concluded
the ſame nyght to departe & to take with
them all their botye and priſoners / of whom
they had mo than̄e two hundred. Than they
ſet a ſure garde at the gates / to thentent that
none ſhulde iſſue out to bewray their entreprice.
¶Nowe ſhall I ſhewe you of a ſcrymyſſhe
that they of Cleremount made with
them.

            ¶Howe they of the towne of Cleremont
made a ſcrimyſſhe with theſe
pyllers (that had taken and robbed
the towne of Mountferante) at the
gates of the towne. Cap. C.xxii.
            
               WHan̄e theſe tydynges
were knowen at Cleremōt
that the Englyſſhe menne
had takenne Moūtferant / 
they were ſoore abaſſhed / 
for they were nere neyghbours / 
So they of Cleremont
toke counſayle toguyder / And without

the towne of Cleremounte on the waye
towardes Mountferant. There was a churche
of Friers as fayre / as ſtronge / & as well
buylded / as any was in the realme of Fraunce:
Whervnto parteyned a great cloſe / enuyroned
with ſtronge hyghe walles / and with
in the cloſe full of Vynes: for one yere with
another the friers had therof / a ſixſcore veſſelles
of wyne. Than ſome ſayde within the
towne that it ſhulde be beſt to beate downe
the Friers / bycauſe it ioyned ſo nere to the
gate or elles it might be to their diſtruction.
Some other ſayde naye / affyrmynge howe
it ſhulde be great pytie and dommage to diſtroye
ſo goodly a houſe / and ſayde. Sirs / 
lette vs go to Mount ferant / and ſermyſſ he
there with our ennemyes / and let vs beſiege
them / there they ſhall neuer ſcape vs. For the
knyghtes and Squyers of this countrey of
Burbonoys and of Foreſtes wyll drawe hyther:
So that within theſe foure dayes ſurelye
they ſhalbe beſieged. Whyle they were
thus debatynge of the matter / there were a
threſcore compaygnions made them ſelfe redy
to departe out of the towne / to go ſe their
ennemyes / and to ſerimyſſhe with theym.
There was no man dyde lette theym / for of
the beſt of the towne were in that company / 
deſyringe to wynne honoure: and toke with
them a .xxx. croſbowes / and ſo rode towardes
Mount feraunt. Thanne after them iſſued
out of Cleremounte mo than two hundred
men a fore / and folowed after. Thanne
horſemen rode ſtreyght to the Barryers of
Mount feraunte. Tidynges came in to the
towne to the Capitayns / howe that they of
Cleremount were come to vyſette them / and
were before the barryers / of whiche tidyngꝭ
they were greatlye reioyſed / and a hundred
armed them and moūted on their horſes / and
opyned the gate & iſſued out on a fronte and
cryed ſaynt George. And whan the cleremō
               toys
ſawe them cōmyng ſo fierſely they were
afrayed and vanquyſſhed within them ſelfe
and beganne to recule without ſhewynge of
any face of defence / and ſo fledde hyther and
thyder: They that were beſt horſed at the cō
               mynge
out of Cleremount and were the formaſt / 
ſayeng: howe they wolde be the fyrſte
that ſhulde make aſſaute / were than the fyrſt
that retourned agayne to the towne / and the
gaſcoyns after them: So that if the gaſcons
horſes had been as go as the Cleremontoys / 
there hadde but a fewe of them entred agayn
in to their towne: Howe beit they were chaſed
tyll they mette with the fote men / who in
lykewiſe than fledde and kepte none order / 
and lepte into the Vynes and in to the dykes
to ſaue themſelfe. The croſbowes that came
out of Cleremount / kepte better array than
their company dyde: For they cloſe toguyder
toke a vyne yarde and bent their bowes / 
and made vyſage of defence: and kepte them
ſelfe there tyll all the Englyſſhe menne were
withdrawen backe agayne to Mountferant.
They of Cleremont loſt twētie of their men
ſixe ſlayne and fourtene taken. Thus it fell
of that enterprice / and all that day euery mā
truſſed and made redy to departe the ſame
nyght after / and by ſixe of the Clocke euery
man hadde truſſed vp their baggage / and laded
their horſes and ſette them ſelte a foote.
They paſt nat a threſcore on horſebacke / and
ſo ſette forwarde in the ſtretes their ſomers
and caryages: they hadde well a foure hundred
horſe charged with clothes / naprie and
furres / and other thynges neceſſary. They
founde in the towne cofes and preſſes full of
ſtuffe / but they lafte them clene voyde. They
bounde their priſoners two and two toguyder:
And whan they were all redy and that it
was nyght / they opyned the gate and iſſued
out: They had taryed in Mount feraunt no
more but eyghtene houres. They ſette their
cariage before them / and thā their priſoners
and foote men / and the capitayns on horſebacke
came after them. The nyght was darke
and the countrey nat aduyſed of their departynge / 
wherfore they were nat purſued / 
and about mydnight they came to Ouſacke / 
fro whens they came the ſeconde day before:
there they reſted them.
            It was ſhewed me that they wanne by the
ſame voyage a hundred thouſande frankes / 
beſyde their priſoners. Sir Peter of Gyache
chauncelloure of Fraunce loſte for his
parte in redy money / thyrtie thouſande frankes
or aboue.
            THe companyons were well counſayled
to leaue Mount feraunt in Auuergne
ſo ſoone as they dyde / For if
they had taryed there two dayes lengar than

they dyde / they hadde nat departed without
great daunger / and paraduenture with loſſe
of their lyues. For all the knyghtes and ſquiers
of the countrey gathered toguyder and
came thyder with puyſſaunce to haue layde
ſiege to the towne / and the lordes of the coū
               trey
(as ye haue herde before named) none
taryed behynde. And the erle Dolphyn was
come within two dayes iourney / but than he
herde tidynges howe the Englyſſhmen and
gaſcoyns were departed to their owne fortereſſes:
and there the trouthe of the hole mater
was ſhewed hym. Whan̄e he knewe the
trouthe / he rode than more at his eaſe & came
to ſaynt Purſayne / and fro thens to Moulyns
in Burbonoyes: And there he foūde the
duches of Burbone his doughter / who was
ſore a frayde of that aduenture / Howe be it
whan ſhe knewe that the aduentures were
gone ſhe was gladde therof / for thanne ſhe
thought her countrey more ſurer than it was
before. By my faythe quod the erle I wolde
it had coſte me greatly / that they had taryed
ſtyll at Mount Ferant tyll I had come thyder:
For if they were there nowe they ſhulde
haue an yuell ende. We coulde nat haue had
a better enterpriſe in all Auuergne / wherby
to haue recouered all the fortreſſes that they
holde. It ſemeth well they are ſkylfull men
of warre / that they taryed there no lengar:
they are gone to their owne holdes with all
their pyllage and priſoners. Thus the Erle
and the ducheſſe his doughter cōmuned toguyder.
And Perot le Bernoys and Olyue
Barbe / the Bourge of Cōpayne / the Bourg
angloys / Apthon Seguyn / and the other capitayns
of the fortreſſes whan they were cōe
to Ouſacke / they departed their botye / pyllage / 
and priſoners. And ſome they raunſomed / 
and the other they ledde to their fortreſſes / 
Some to Carlat / and ſome to Gaſlucet / 
All the countre of Auuergne toke better hede
to they holdes / than they hadde done before:
Howe be it the erle of Armynake and the erle
Dolphyn ſente to Perotte le Bernoys / ſayeng:
howe falſely and traytourouſly he had
taken and ſtollen the towne of Mountferant
and robbed it / and ledde away the priſoners
counſaylynge hym to make therof amendes.
Conſydringe howe they were in treatie toguyder

                  •
               or a peace. Perotte aunſwered and
ſayde: Sauyng their graces / as for my ſelfe
and ſeuyn other Capitayns that were with
me at the takynge of Mountferant / were neuer
at no maner of treatie with theſe Erles / 
nor we toke nat this towne fraudulently / nor
ſtale it: But I entred in at the gate whiche
was opyned redy to receyue me. If I and
my company hadde been ſworne to any treatie / 
we wolde haue kepte it ſurely / But we
were neuer of that entencyon nor wyll be.
In this caſe the mater ſtoode and the lordes
coude haue none other anſwere. Sir Peter
of Gyache was ſore diſpleaſed / for the loſſe
that he hadde: And as for them of Mounte
ferant / recouered them ſelfe as well as they
myght. Thus this aduentures fell.

            ¶Howe the duke of Berrey maryed
the lady Mary his doughter to
the erle of Bloys ſonne: And howe
the ſame yere the ſonne of the duke
of Berrey marryed the lady Mary
of Fraunce / ſuſter to the yong kyng
Charles of Fraunce. Cap. C.xxiii.
            
               IN the yere of our lorde
God / a thouſande thre
hūdred fourſcore and ſixe / 
in the moneth of Auguſt / 
Guye the erle of Bloyes
and the Lady Mary his
wyfe departed fro ye towne
of Bloyes / well acompanyed with knightes
and ſquyes / ladyes and damoſelles to go
in to Berrey / and they had with theym their
yonge ſonne / who hadde fyaunced the yere
before / Mary doughter to the duke of Berrey.
and the entencyon of the erle of Bloyes
and of the coūteſſe his wyfe / was that whan
they ſhulde come to Burgus in Berrey / to ꝓcede
to ye ſayd maryage. In lykewiſe it was
the entencyon of the duke of Berrey & of the
duches his wyfe. Thus whā all theſe ꝑties
were come togyder / than theſe two chyldren
were ioyned togider in mariage in the churche

of ſaynt Stephyn in Burgus by a Cardynall / 
the chauncellour of Berrey and the
byſſhoppe of Poyters had the yere before enſured
theym toguyder. It this maryage of
Loyes of Bloyes and of the lady Mary of
Berrey in the cytie of Burgus / was made
great feeſt and tryumphes with iuſtes & turneyes.
This feeſt endured eight dayes. whā
this was accomplyſſhed / the erle of Bloyes
and the counteſſe tooke leaue of the duke of
Berrey and of the ducheſſe / and ſo returned
to Bloyes and hadde with them their yonge
doughter. Alſo in the ſame yere Iohn̄ of Berrey
ſonne to the duke of Berrey called Erle
of Mountpenſier maryed the lady Mary of
Fraunce ſuſter to the yonge kynge of Fraū
               ce.
In the ſame yere that theſe Maryages
were thus made: In the tyme of lente / the ducheſſe
of Berrey and Mary of Fraunce her
doughter / and her ſonne rode to the towne of
Bloyes / to ſe the Erle Bloyes and the counteſſe / 
and their chyldren. They were receyued
in to the Caſtell of Bloyes with great
ioye. At all theſe maters I ſir Iohan Froiſſarte
was preſent: And whan they had been
there in great Feeſt thre dayes / they departed
and toke their way to Poyters: but they
went by water by the ryuer of Loyre to Amboyſe / 
and fro thens in chares and on horſebacke / 
tyll they came to Poytou. There the
ducheſſe helde her houſe mooſt cōmonly in a
good caſtell and good towne called Chynon
In this yere dyed Mary of Fraunce beyng
yonge / who was wyfe to the erle of Mountpenlier.
In lykewiſe ſoone after dyed the lady
Iane of Armynake ducheſſe of Berrey.
Thus the duke of Berrey and his ſonne were
to marry agayne (as they dyd) but nat ouer
ſoone. Of the whiche maryages / and ſpecyallye
of the dukes: I ſhall ſhewe you here
after / whan the mater ſhall requyre to haue
it declared.
            
               YE haue well herde here before / 
howe the duke of Guerles had
defyed the French kyng diſpyte
fully / whiche was ſpoken o
                  •
                ſar
and nere. For as the brute was / 
it was nat done in no curteſſe maner / but out
of the ſtyle and vſage of all other defyances.
Trouthe it is / I ſawe my ſelfe certayne writynges
in paper / the whiche was ſayde to be
the true copy: But bycauſe I ſawe it nat vnderſeale / 
nor aproued as ſuch maters ought
to be that touche great princes / ſuche as is
the Frenche kyng / therfore I gaue no greatcredence
therto: Howe be it / it ſemed well
that this defyaunce was diſpleaſaunt to the
realme / & wolde haue it amended. And that
the duke of Guerles ſhulde excuſe hym of the
ſpytefull wordes that were in the defyaunce.
The kynges coūſayle wolde in no wyſe that
the mater ſhulde reſt ſo / for the great lordes
of Fraunce ſayde. Without the kyng founde
ſome remedy / they and all the realme ſhulde
be greatly to blame: And they ſayd howe the
kynge was yonge and forwarde / and yt was
well ſene in his iourney in Flaunders. And
if he go nat forwarde nowe to reuenge this
dede / men wolde ſpeke dyuerſlye of the nobles
of the realme of Fraunce / who ſhulde
counſayle the kynge / and are ſworne to kepe
and defende his honour / and to refourme all
that is myſordred. And to the entent that the
kynge nor the realme ſhulde beare no blame
the lorde of Coucy toke payne in the mater:
And ſhewed well howe the mater touchedde
hym nere. He knewe the almayns better thā
he dyde any other / for he hadde been often in
their cōpanyes / as well for the chalenge that
he made to the duchy of Auſtryche / as for other
inſydentes that he hadde amonge them.
            THe kynges vncles ſawe well howe
all the nobles of the Realme were
well enclyned to haue the mater redreſſed / 
and ſpecially the duke of Burgoyne
hadde great affectyon therto / for the duke of
Guerles haryed and pylled the ducheſſe of
Brabantes countrey / The whiche enherytaunce
ſhulde retourne to hym after ye dethe
of the two ladyes who were right aged / both
the duches and her ſuſtre. wherfore he wolde
that outher by warre or other meanes / that
the duke of Guerles were apeaſed. Howe be
it fyrſt of all it was requiſyte to make all the
membres of Fraunce one and of one opinyon:
For it ſhulde be a farre iourney for the
kynge to go out of Fraunce in to Almaygne
to conquere landes and countreis / The whiche
the kynge coulde nat do / without he had
all his hole puyſſaunce with hym / for it was

nat knowen whyder the almaygnes / who be
couetous people / wolde helpe and aſſyſt the
duke of Guerles or nat. Alſo furthermore / 
the duke of Burgoyne and the other noble
men of Fraunce / ſawe well howe the duke of
Bretayne was in great differēce with the realme
of Fraunce and began marueylouſly. &
ſhewed by his dedes that he had as lyue haue
warre with ye realme of Fraūce as peace:
And the lordes knewe well howe he prouyded
his townes / caſtels / & cyties with great
prouiſyon of men / vitayls / and artillary / to
defende any ſiege. And beſydes that / often tymes
he wrote in to Englande with louynge
treatable wordes to make alyaunce for euer:
And the Englyſſhmen were wyllyng therto
to the entent that their warre with Fraunce / 
myght be the better for them after. Thanne
the counſayle of Fraūce wolde nat that there
ſhulde be lefte behynde them ſuche a myſt in
Bretaygne / but that firſt it myght be putte a
waye by good meanes and condute. They
thought they wolde nat putte the realme in
that doute: If the kynge ſhulde go in to Almaygne
and leaue the realme deſtytute (as
this the Kynges vncles ymagined) They
wyſte nat howe to ſtoppe the duke of Bretayne / 
for as than ſuche as they had ſent thyder
were retourned: as the byſſhoppe of Lā
               gers / 
ſir Iohan of Vyen / and ſir Iohan de
Beull. They ſhewed the kyng & his vncles
howe they had done nothyng to purpoſe. thā
the duke of Berry aduyſed to ſende to Bretayne
to entreat with the duke his coſyn / the
erle of Stampes who was a ſage perſone &
a treatable. Than the duke deſyred hym and
ſayde. Fayre coſyn / it behoueth that ye go in
to Bretaygne to ſpeke with our coſyn the duke
there. If ye fynde hym harde and highe
of wordes / chafe nat with hym / treate hym
ſwetely and after a good maner. And ſpeke
ſagely to hym / and bring hym in to good reaſon
and it may be: And ſhewe hym howe the
kynge and I and my brother of Burgoyne / 
wolde nothing to hym but good loue & peace
And if he wyll abyde and holde with vs / we
ſhall alwayes be redy to do hym pleaſure. &
alſo ſhewe hym that as for the caſtels that he
holdeth of the cōſtables / how that for a ſmall
occaſion he hath ceaſed them. But & it wolde
pleaſe hym to rendre them agayne / it ſhulde
be greatly to his honour. And howe that the
kynge ſhall gyue hym as fayre and as good
as they be / in any other place where he wyll
choſe in the realme. Good coſyn do ſo moche
as to bringe vs ſome good tydinges / and for
any tarieng there / departe nat fro him tyll ye
bring ſome mater to paſſe: and haue well in
your remembraūce all this buſyneſſe and all
his anſwere / and the order of his eſtate. The
erle of Stampes anſwered and ſayde. Sir / 
all this ſhalbe done right gladly.
            AFter that the erle of Stāpes had this
charge fro the duke of Berey to go in
to Bretayne to the duke his coſyn: He taried
nat long but made hymſelfe redy and paſſed
by Chartres / and through the good countre
of Mayne / and ſo came to Angers and there
founde the quene of Naples / who hadde ben
wyfe to the duke of Aniou: Who was called
kyng of Naples / of Cicyle / of Hieruſalem / &
duke of Pole / of Calabre / and erle of Prouence:
And in her company her two fayre ſonnes
Loyes and Charles. The lady receyued
her coſyn the erle of Stampes ioyfully / and
there was Iohn̄ of Bretayne who loued nat
the duke of Bretayne / but he was nat in power
to ſhewe forthe his yuell wyll / nor to amende
it. Whan therle of Stampes had ben
there a daye and a night / he tooke his leaue &
departed and rode to Chaſteaulx / and iourneyed
ſo long that he came to the cite of Naū
               tes
and there refreſſhed hym. And than he demaūded
where the duke was / and it was ſhewed
hym howe he was in the marches of Wē
               nes
& therefoūde the duke who receyued him
ioyouſly / for they were nere coſyns togider.
The erle of Stampes who right well coude
acquyte hymſelfe amonge great princes and
ladyes (for he had been brought vp amonge
theym in his youthe) acquytedde hym ſelfe
right ſagely with the duke. And ſhewed nat
the princypall affectyon of his corage at his
fyrſte commynge / but diſſymuled two or thre
dayes / and whan he ſawe his tyme he humyled
hym ſelfe greatlye to the duke / the rather
therby to drawe hym to his entent / and than
ſayd. Sir and my right dere coſyn / ye ought
nat to marueyle thoughe I am come ſo farre
of to ſe you / for greatlye I haue deſyred it.
And than notably he ſhewed hym the charge
that he hadde to ſaye to hym / on the behalfe
of the duke of Berrey / of the whiche wordes

the duke made light. And for reſolucion of anſwere
at that tyme / the duke ſayde. Coſyn we
knowe well this that ye haue ſayde is trewe.
I ſhall remembre me and ye ſhall abyde here
with vs as long as it ſhall pleaſe you / for your
comyng dothe vs great pleaſure. Other aunſwere
the erle coulde nat haue / as at that tyme.
The erle taryed there a fyftene dayes / and the
duke ſhewed hym gret loue / and ſhewed hym
the fayre caſtell of Ermyn / whiche was nere
to Wannes the whiche the duke had newely
made / and there he toke parte of his paſtaūce.
And alwayes whanne he ſawe a conuenyente
tyme / he ſhewed ſwetely and ſagely the cauſe
of his comyng. And euer the duke aunſwered
hym ſo couertly / that the erle coulde haue no
ſuretie in any aunſwere / to make any reſtytucion
of a hundred thouſand frankes nor of the
caſtels that he helde of the conſtables / the whiche
yet at the ende he dyd / and that was without
requeſt of any perſone / whan it was leſte
loked for (as I ſhall ſhewe you hereafter as I
was enfourmed) Whan ye erle Stampes ſawe
that he laye there in vayne / than he thought to
take his leaue / and to retourne in to Fraunce / 
and ſo he dyd. The duke gaue hym leaue / and
at his departynge gaue hym a fayre whyte
palfrey / aparelled and it had ben for a kynge / 
and gaue hym a fayre rynge with a ſtone / well
worthe a thouſande frankes. Thus the erle departed
and retourned by Angers / and there
founde the quene of Napoles / and Iohan of
Bretayne / who greatly deſyred to here tydynges
and ſayd. Fayre coſyn / I thynke ye haue
ſped well / for ye haue taryed longe out. Than
the erle ſhewed parte of his buſyneſſe but fynally
howe he had ſpedde nothynge. Whan he
had taryed there a day / he departed and went
to Towrs / and at laſt came in to Berrey / and
founde the duke at Mehyn / a caſtell of his / 
whiche he had newly made / and had workemen
dayly theron. Whan the duke of Berrey
ſawe the erle of Stampes he made hym good
chere / and demaunded tydinges of Bretayne.
There he declared fro poynt to poynte all that
he had ſente and herde / and ſayde: howe in no
wyſe he coulde breke the duke of Bretayne fro
his purpoſe. The duke of Berrey paſſed the
mater lyghtly / whan he ſawe it wolde be none
otherwyſe. And ſo retourned in to Fraunce to
the king and to the duke of Burgoyne his brother / 
and ſhewed theym howe he had ſente in
to Bretaygne to the duke his coſyn the erle of
Stampes / and declared in euery poynt howe
he had ſpedde. Thus the mater reſted / whan
they ſawe none other remedy.

            ¶Howe after the departynge of the
duke of Lācaſtre all that euer he had
wonne in Galyce / the frenchmen recouered
it in leſſe than fyftene dayes / 
and howe the engliſſhmen that had
ben there ī that warre defamed and
ſpake yuell of the coūtrey of Galyce / 
and howe the frenche kynge ſent for
the duke of Irelande. Ca. C.xxiiii.
            
               IT hath been reſyted
here before in this hyſtory / 
howe the engliſſhmen dyd
in Galyce / & howe the duke
and the ducheſſe / and his
doughter came to ye Porte
of Portyngale / and there
taryed a ſeaſon with kynge Iohan of Portugale / 
and with the yonge quene / doughter to
the duke of Lancaſtre (as ye haue herde here
before) It anoyed greatly the duke / and nat
without a cauſe / in that he had done nothynge
for his profyte all that ſeaſon in Caſtyle / but
that he hadde done was to his great domage / 
his men deed of ſykenes of the beſt of his company / 
knyghtes and ſquyers. And ſuche conqueſt
as he hadde made with great payne and
coſt / he ſawe well it ſhulde beſoone recouered
agayne by the kynge of caſtell. And in dede ſo
it was. for as ſone as he was departed and entred
in to Portugale / and that the ſpanyardes
and knyghtes of Fraunce / ſuche as were taryed
there with ſyr Olyuer of Cleſquyn conſtable
of Caſtyle / ſawe that the duke of Lancaſtre
was departed / and that in maner all his
englyſſhe men were departed fro hym. Than
they ſette forwarde to reconquere agayne all
that had ben loſte of the realme of Caſtyle / the
whiche was ſone done / for they of the townes / 
caſtels / & cyties in Galyce / had rather to haue
ben vnder the obeyſaunce of the kynge of Caſtyle / 
than vnder the duke of Lancaſter / without

he had been able to haue kepte the felde / to
haue defended the countrey. For they of Caſtyle / 
Lombardy / and of Italy / of vſage euer
they ſaye (Lyue he that is ſtrongeſt / and he
that wynneth) All that euer the duke of Lancaſtre
had wonne fro the feaſt of Eaſter to the
begynnynge of Iuly / all was wonne agayne
and refreſſhed with newe frenchmen and men
of Caſtyle / and the englyſſhmen that were left
there by the duke in garyſons (who thought
to haue taryed there peaſably all the wynter)
were ſone put out / outher by fayre meanes or
perforce / and ſome ſlayne / ſuche as wolde nat
yelde vp / and ſome returned by ſauecōducte to
paſſe by Portugale / & ſo to Bayon or to Burdeaux.
And of all this the duke of Lancaſtre
was well aduertyſed / he beynge in the cytie of
Porte in Portugale / but he coude nat remedy
it / whiche was ryghtſore dypleaſaunte to his
herte. It is nat to be beleued the contrary / for
the more noble / valyaunt / and ſage that a man
is / diſpleaſures to hym be the more bytter and
paynefull. howe be it the duke wolde ſay often
tymes (and bare out a good face) If we haue
loſt this yere / by the grace of god a nother ſeaſon
ſhall be for vs. the fortunes of this worlde
are meruaylous / they can nat be always permanente.
Alſo the kynge of Portugale gaue
hym alwayes good comforte / and ſayde. Syr
ye may abyde here and kepe your aſtate / and
wryte to youre bretherne and frendes in Englande / 
that they maye ſende you this nexte
Marche a fyue or ſyre hundred ſpeares / and
two thouſande archers / and I ſhall gather to
gyder my power and people / who haue good
myndes to make warre into Caſtyle / & ſo we
ſhall make a good warre. ſomtyme one countrey
wynneth and a nother leſeth. The duke of
Lancaſtre thanked the kynge of Portugale of
his good comforte and offre. Howe beit for all
that the kyng was ye dukes ſonne in lawe / and
had maryed his doughter / and that he ſayde
was of a good wyll. yet for all that the duke diſcouered
nat all his corage / for he knewe well
Englande was in trouble / and great debate a
monge the lordes / and howe the lordes hadde
maters yno we to attende vnto / as well for the
kepynge of the fronters agaynſt Scotlande / 
as for to treate with the duke of Bretaygne.
And the kyng knewe well that whan the duke
came out of Englande / there was a do to ſette
forwarde his armye / wherfore he thought it
ſhulde be harde to get any newe ayde thence / 
ſeinge the realme at ſo many great charges all
redy / and alſo he thought well that ſuche englyſſhmen
as were retourned wolde no more
come thyder agayne / but thought rather that
they ſhulde dyſcorage other to come. the duke
conſidered all theſe maters in his mynde / and
whan he had ben a ſeaſon at the cytie of Porte
with the kynge of Portugale / than on a daye
he ſayd. Syr / it ſhulde be for my profyte to retourne
to Bayon / and to the marches of Burdeaulx
for dyuerſe reaſons. He ſawe well his
beynge in Portugale coulde do him lytell aduaūtage / 
for there he was nat on his herytage
that he deſyred / but he ſayde his goynge in to
the archebyſſhoppriche of Burdeaux and of
Auloſe / and ſo to retourne by Bygore / and ſo
by the lande of the lombriſience / of the countie
of Foyze / and countie of Armynake / and ſo by
Garonne / Dordone / and entrynge in to Pier
gourte and Querchyn / Rochelloys / Xayntone / 
Criſtynge / Poictou / Auuergne and Lymoſyn / 
wherin were many garyſons and caſtels
holden of the engliſſhe parte / who wolde
all make warre for his ſake. Wherfore he ſayd
it were better for hym to be amonge theym to
counſaile and encorage them / than to be in any
other place. And alſo he ſayde howe Portugale
was farre of to here any newes out of Englande / 
and alſo he knewe well yt the englyſſh
men wolde be lothe to come thyder bycauſe of
the long voyage by ſee / and alſo he knewe well
that ſhyppes of Spaygne / of Galyce / and of
Caſtyle were goynge and comynge on the ſee
in and out to Flaunders with their marchandyſes / 
whiche was alſo great daunger for encountrynge
of them. All theſe thynges conſydred / 
the duke of Lancaſtre prepared for his
departynge / and had ſhyppes apoynted hym
by the kynge / and a patrone called Alphons
Bretat. Whan theſe galyes were redy and the
wynde good / the duke and the duches and her
doughter / toke leaue of the kynge of Portugale
and of the quene / and ſo toke ſhyppynge
and entred on the ſee / abydynge goddes pleaſure
and wyndes. They had wynde and wether
at pleaſure / ſo that they aryued at Bayon
of whoſe comynge they of the countrey were
ioyfull / deſyringe ſore to ſe them.
            Whan the duke and the duches and their
doughter were aryued at Bayon. Tydynges

therof ſpredde abrode / and they of Burdeloys
were ryght ioyfull therof. Than ſir Iohan of
Harpdame ſeneſſhall of Burdeaux / and the
ſeneſſhall of the landes came thyder to ſe the
duke / and ſo dyd other gentlemen of the countrey / 
as the lorde of Mucydente / the lorde of
Duras / the lorde of Roſem / the lorde of Landuras / 
the lorde Leſpare / the lorde of Newechaſteaur / 
and other knyghtes and ſquyers of
the countrey. Thus they came dayly / ſome at
one tyme ſome at another / all they offred hym
their ſeruyce / as they ought to do to their lord.
Thus the duke taryed at Bayon / and often tymes
ſente in to Englande to the kynge his nephewe / 
and to his other bretherne. But for all
his writynge he was nothynge comforted / nother
with men of armes nor archers / for as the
worlde wente than / the dukes buſyneſſe was
lytell taken hede vnto / nor lorde / knyght / nor
ſquyer to make any haſt to auaunce forwarde
to the ayde of the duke of Lancaſtre. for ſuche
as had ben in Portugale made ſuche reporte
through the realme of Englande / that no man
had corage to auaunce thyder / but euery man
ſaid. the voyage in to Caſtyle is to farre of fro
vs. It is more profytable for vs to haue warre
with Fraunce / for that is a good ſwete countrey
and temperate / and good lodgynges and
fayre ſwete ryuers. And in Caſtyle there is no
thynge but harde rockes and Mountaynes / 
whiche are nat good to eate / and an vntemperate
ayre / and troubled ryuers / and dyuerſe
meates / and ſtronge wynes & hote / and poore
people / rude / and yuell arayed / farre of fro our
maner. wherfore it were folly to go thyder / for
if we entre in to any great cytie or towne there
wenynge to fynde maruayles / we ſhall fynde
nothynge but wyne / larde / and empty cofers.
This is contrarye to the realme of Fraunce / 
for there whan it is fortune to wyn any towne
or cytie / we fynde ſuche rycheſſe that we be a
baſſhed therof / and it is good to make warre
where we may haue profyte. let vs aduenture
there / and leaue the vnhappy warre of Caſtyle
and Portugale / where is no thynge but pouuertye
and domage. Thus the englyſſhe men
ſayde in Englande / ſuche as had been in Caſtyle / 
ſo that the lordes perceyued well howe
that voyage was out of the fauoure of the englyſſhe
men. Alſo the realme was in trouble / 
and the iuſtyce of Triuylyen and outher but
newly done / and the duke of Irelande departed
out of the Realme / and kynge Rycharde
came to the guydynge of newe counſayle / the
whiche he hadde nat well lerned. So by reaſon
of ſuche inſydentes the matters abode in
harde caſe for the duke of Lancaſtre / beynge
in the cytie of Bayon / where he helde all that
ſeaſon.
            ALl theſe buſyneſſes as well in Caſtyle
and Portugale / as in Englande (and
of the departyng of the duke of Irelande) was
well knowen with the frenche kynge and his
counſayle. Than to haue more parfyte knowledge / 
it was ordayned by the frenche kynge
and by his vncles to ſende to Trecte to ye duke
of Irelande / where as he was / and to gyue
hym a ſure ſaueconduct to come into Fraunce
and to tarye there as longe as bothe partyes
were pleaſed. It was behouable to ſende for
hym by ſpecyall meſſangers / and ſure wrytyng
fro the kyng / or els the duke of Irelande
wolde nat haue come there / for he knewe well
that he was out of the loue and fauoure of the
lorde Coucy / who was a great baron in the realme
of Fraunce / and was of a great lynage.
He had no cauſe to loue hym (as ye haue herde
before) for acordynge to the trouthe the duke
had nat well acquyted hymſelfe to his wyfe / 
who was doughter to the lorde Coucy. And
certaynly it was the principall thing that toke
awaye the good renome of his honour / bothe
in Fraunce and in other places. And in lykewyſe
he was blamed / defamed / and hated in
Englande / as well as in Fraunce. Whan the
frenche kynge had concluded to ſende for the
duke of Irelande / the lorde of Coucy ſpake as
moche agaynſt it as he myght / but there were
ſo many reaſons layde to hym (and alſo bycauſe
the kyng wolde haue it) that he was contente
to ſuffre it. The frenche kynge who was
but yong deſyred greatly to ſe the duke of Irelande / 
bycauſe he was reputed to be a good
knyght / and alſo bycauſe it was ſayd howe he
was ſo well beloued with the kynge of Englande.
Thanne he was ſente for by a knyght
and a clerke / a notary of the kynges. Whan
the Duke of Irelande herde fyrſte howe the
frenche kynge had ſente for hym / he had maruayle
therof / and hadde dyuerſe imagynacyons
for what entente he ſhulde be ſente for in
to Fraunce / howe be it fynally he thought the

myght go ſurely in to Fraunce to ſe the kynge
by reaſon of his ſaueconducte / and to returne
agayne at his pleaſure. Than he departed fro
Trecte / and rode forthe with theym that the
kynge had ſent to hym / and rode ſo longe that
they came to Paris / for as than the kyng was
there in his caſtell of Lowre. There the duke
was well receyued of the kynge and of his vncles.
The frenche kynge deſyred him to abyde
there ſtyll and apoynted hym a place to kepe
his houſe & aſtate in / for the duke had ynough
ſo to do / for he had conueyed out of Englande
good ynough. And alſo ye conſtable of Fraūce
ought hym certayne money for the raunſome
of Iohan of Bretayne / the whiche was nat all
payed as than. Thus the duke wente whan it
pleaſed hym to ſe the kynge / and hadde good
chere. and at all feaſtes / iuſtes / and triumphes
the duke was alwayes ſente for.

            ¶Howe the Conſtable of Fraunce
wolde nat acorde that the king ſhulde
go in to Almayne / bycauſe of the
inſydentes of the realme / and howe
the duke of Bretaygne fournyſſhed
his garyſons & made alyaunce with

Cap. C.xxv.
            
               YE haue herde before howe
the erle de Stampes was ſent in
to Bretayne by the duke of Berrey / 
thynkynge to haue brought
the duke of Bretayne with fayre
wordes to his mynde and entenſyon / But he
coulde nat brynge it aboute / but retourned agayne
without atteynynge any thynge of his
purpoſe. wherof they in Fraunce were greatly
abaſſhed / and ſpecially ſuche as were of the
kinges coūſayle / for they knewe well the kyng
had great deſyre to go in to Almayne / to ſe the
landes of his coſyns the duke of Iulyers / and
to be reuenged of the hygh wordes and cruell
defyaunces of the duke of Guerles. The wyſe
men of the counſayle of Fraunce ſuche as conceyued
well the mater imagyned therin great
parell to the realme / for they clerely perceyued
howe the duke of Bretayne wolde in no wyſe
condyſcende to reaſon / but helde ſtyll his purpoſe.
They thought it was greatly preiudycyall
to the honoure of the realme of Fraunce / 
for hym to take the conſtable of Fraunce / and
to ſette hym at raunſome at a hundred thouſande
frankes / and to kepe thre of his caſtelles
and a good towne. And alſo they ſawe howe
the duke of Bretayne was makynge of great
alyaunces with the kynge of Englande / and
knewe well howe the duke fortifyed greatly
his townes and caſtels in Bretayne / and went
aboute to get hym frendes in dyuers partyes / 
in ſo moche that many of the noble menne of
Bretayne wyſte nat what to do / outher to go
in to Fraunce or to a byde there ſtyll with the
duke and to take his parte agaynſt the kynge
or the realme of Fraunce / the whiche they neuer
thought to do / for the moſte parte of the
knyghtes and Squyers of Bretaygne were
alwayes good frenche / But the counſayle of
Fraunce doubted that if the kynge wente out
of the realme with his puyſſaunce / the whiche
he muſte nedes do if he ſhulde goo in to Almaygne / 
that than the duke of Bretayne to
bring in to his countrey the englyſſhmen / outher
at ſaynte Malowe / at ſaynt Mathewes / 
or at Lamballe / or Camperle / or Lantriguier
at Guerrando / or Bownte / or at Wennes / or
on the ſee coſte. For the englyſſhemen coulde
nat haue a better entre in to Fraunce than by
Bretayne. So that they knewe nat (the kynges
honour ſaued) howe to breke the duke of
Bretayne fro his purpoſe. Some of the kynges
counſayle ſayde / it ſhall be to the kynges
dyſhonour if he breke nat the dukes purpoſe / 
for ye duke is nat lorde peaſably ouer his owne
countrey / for we thynke the lordes / knyghtes / 
and ſquyers of Bretayne wyll nat be agaynſt
vs / to mayntayne the dukes opynion / therfore
in the name of god lette the kynge kepe on his
voyage / and lette the conſtable and other lordes
a byde in their countreys and defende the
Realme. This opynyon was well vpholde
with many of the kynges counſayle. but than
ſome other ſayde naye therto / and ſayde howe
the kyng coulde nat well go out of his realme
without he had his conſtable with hym / for he

is more wyſer and hathe more experyence in
warre than a great nombre of other. Thus
they argued. Than ſome other ſayd / lette two
of the kynges vncles go or one of them at the
leſt / and layde it to the duke of Burgoyne that
he ſhulde go with two thouſande ſpeares / and
ſyre or ſeuen thouſande of other men of warre / 
and ſayde / it was moſte meteſt for hym to go / 
for that warre touched hym nere / bycauſe it
moued by reaſone of the duchy of Brabante / 
and that he ſhulde haue with him them of Brabante / 
of whome he ſhulde fynde in nombre to
the ſome of ſeuen hundred ſpeares / and .xx. or
thurty thouſande of other comons of the countrey
of Brabante. Than a nother ſorte ſayde.
ſirs / your opynyons be nat good for the kyng
wyll go / he nameth hymſelfe the chyefe of this
warre / for he is defyed / wherfore he muſte go / 
conſydrynge the charge is his / it is good that
he go / for he is yonge / and the more he contynueth
the warre the better he ſhall loue it. than
ſome other ſayd. Who is he that is ſo hardy to
counſayle the kynge to go in to Almayne / in
to ſo farre a countrey / amonge theym that be
hyghe and prowed people / and great parell it
is to entre vpon them. And if the kynge were
entred / yet it were great daunger the retournynge
agayne. for whan they ſhall knowe the
kynge and all the nobles of Fraunce to be entred
in to their countrey / they wyll than aſſemble
all togyder / and kepe ſuche a countrey as
they knowe / and we nat / and ſo they maye do
vs great domage / for they are couetous people
aboue all other. And they haue no pytie / if
they haue the vpper hande / and are harde and
yuell handelers of their priſoners / and putteth
them to ſondry paynes / to compell theym to
make their raunſomes the greater. and if they
haue a lorde or a great man to their priſoner / 
they make great ioye therof / and wyll conuey
hym in to Boeſme / or in to Auſtryche / or in to
Xaſenne / and kepe hym in ſome caſtell inhabytable.
They are people worſe than ſarazins
or paynyms / for their exceſſyue couetouſneſſe
quencheth the knowledge of honoure. Lette
vs go and put the kynge in daunger amonge
theſe people / and if any thynge happen to fall
a myſſe / as the chaunces of fortune are maruaylous / 
what ſhall be ſayde than? howe we
haue brought the kynge thyder to betray him / 
and to the dyſtructyon of the realme / and nat
for the augmentynge therof. God defende the
realme fro all domage and parell. If the kyng
go he muſte haue parte of his noble men with
hym. And if myſſe fortune fall / the realme of
Fraunce is loſte without recouery. Therfore
loke wyſely if it be good to counſayle the kyng
to go that voyage in to Almayne. Than ſome
other / ſuche as had wyſely coniected all parelles
in their imagynacyons ſayd. In the name
of god lette nother the kynge go / nor yet ſende
thyder no puyſſaunce. For though the duke of
Guerles who is but yonge / and that youthe
of wytte haue made hym to defye the kynge / 
whiche was nat done by no greate wyſdome / 
nor good counſayle / but rather done by foliſſh
pride of yonge people / who wolde flye or they
haue wynges. And ſythe he hathe thus defyed
the kynge / lette hym alone and ſuffre hym to
purſewe his deſyaunce / the realme of Fraunce
is great / if he entre in to the realme in any maner
of wyſe / the kinge ſhall ſone be enfourmed
therof / and than he ſhall haue a iuſte cauſe to
ſtyre vp his people / and to go and fyght agaynſte
hym / where ſo euer he fynde hym / or
els to make hym flye or yelde hym in the felde / 
and therby the kynge ſhall haue more honour
and leſſe charge than to go in to Guerles / for
ſuche as knowe the countrey ſaye / that or we
can come to the duke if he lyſte / we muſt paſſe
a foure great ryuers / the lyſte of them as great
as the ryuer of Loyre at Namurs or Charite.
Alſo they ſay / it is a fowle countrey and yuell
lodgynges.
            
               THe noble men and counſaylouts
of Fraunce were thus in dyuers
imagynacyons on this voyage / 
that the kynge wolde make in to
Almayne / and ſurely it had ben auaunſed
the ſoner forwarde and they had nat
douted the venym that myght growe by the
occaſyon of Bretayne / and of the duke there / 
that mater drewe theym a backe. And indede
they had good cauſe to doute it / for the duke
of Bretayne was well infourmed of the defyaunce
that the duke of Guerles hadde made to
the Frenche kynge / and howe that the yonge
kinge Charles wolde go in to Almayne. The
duke loked for nothyng els / but that the kynge
ſhulde be ones departed out of his Realme of
Fraunce / he hadde ordeyned and concluded
bytwene hym and the englyſſhe men / to ſuffre
the engliſſhe army to entre in to his countrey.

And alſo he had by ſubtyle meanes drawen to
his acorde the moſte parte of the good townes
of Bretaygne / and ſpecyally Nauntes / Wennes / 
Rennes / Lentriguier / Guerrādo / Lambale / 
ſaynte Malo / and ſaynte Mathewe defyn
poterne / but the noble men he coulde nat
gette to his opynyon. Than the duke imagyned
if the lordes ſhulde go with the conſtable
of Fraunce in to Almayne / thanne his warre
and entente ſhulde the ſoner come to paſſe. He
cauſed his townes and caſtels to be well prouyded
for / with vytayles and artyllary / and
he ſhewed well howe he inclyned rather to the
warre than to haue peaſe. Alſo he had great alyaunce
with Charles they yonge kyng of Nauerre / 
and the duke promyſed hym / that if he
might come to his entent (to haue puyſſaunce
of men of armes and archers out of Englāde)
he wolde bringe them ſtreight in to Normandy / 
and recouer fyrſt the good townes and caſtels
that kynge Charles of Fraunce vncle to
the kynge of Nauerre / had taken fro hym by
his men / as the lorde of Coucy and outher. Of
this the kynge of Nauer had great truſt / and
by reaſon therof he helde in humble loue the
duke of Lancaſtre who was at Bayon / for bytwene
theym was great alyaunces. And of all
this I ſawe great apparence / as I ſhall ſhewe
after.
            IN the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and eyght / the ſeuenth
daye of Aprell / it was concluded by the
kynge of Englande and his counſayle / and by
his vncles / the duke of yorke / and the duke of
Gloceſtre / that the erle Rycharde of Arundell
ſhulde be heed and chefe of an army on the ſee / 
with hym a thouſande men of armes / and thre
thouſande archers / and to be at Hamton the
fyftene day of May / and there to fynde his nauy
redy apparelled. And euery man that was
apoynted to go to be there redy at that daye.
And the kynge of Englande on ſaynte Georges
daye nexte after / helde a great feaſt at his
caſtell of Wyndeſore. And there were the chefe
lordes that ſhulde go with therle of Arundell / 
and there they toke their leaues of the kynge
and of the quene / and of all other ladyes / and
ſo came to Hampton at their daye apoynted / 
and entred in to their ſhyppes the twenty day
of May / whiche was a fayre clere day. There
was the erle of Arundell / the erle of Notyngham / 
the Erle of Deuonſhyre / ſyr Thomas
Percy / the lorde Clifforde / ſir Iohn̄ of Ware / 
wyke / ſir Willyam de la Selle / the lorde Cameux / 
ſyr Stephyn de Libery / ſyr Willyam
Helman / ſyr Thomas Moreaur / ſyr Iohan
Dambreticourt / ſyr Roberte Sere / ſir Peter
Mountbery / ſir Loys Clombo / ſir Thomas
Coq / ſyr Willyam Pulle / and dyuers other.
They were of good men of armes a thouſand
ſpeares / and aboute a thre thouſande archers.
They had with theym no horſes / for they truſted
if they might come to their ententes to entre
in to Bretayne / and there to refreſſhe them
where as they ſhulde fynde horſes ynowe at a
good price to ſerue them. The daye that they
departed fro Hampton was ſo fayre and peaſable
that it was meruayle. they drewe towardes
Normādy nat purpoſyng to lande in any
parte / but to paſſe by the fronters of Normandy
and Bretayne / tyll they herde other newes.
They had in their nauy certayne veſſels called
Ballengers / who ſayled on before to ſe if
they myght fynde any aduenture / in lyke maner
as knyghtes do by lande go before the bataylles
to dyſcouer the coūtrey and enbuſſhes.
¶Nowe we ſhall leaue a ſeaſon of ſpekynge
of this army / and ſpeke ſomwhat of the buſyneſſe
of Guerles & Brabant / and ſhewe howe
the ſiege was layde to Graue.
         
         
            ¶Howe the brabanſoys layde ſiege
to the towne of Graue. And howe
the conſtable of Fraunce toke ſaynte
Malo and ſaynte Mathewes / and
ſet there men in garyſon / and howe
the duke of Lancaſtre was at Bayon
greatly dyſcomforted / in that he
coulde gette no maner of ayde.
Cap. C.xxvi.
            
               AS it hath been ſhewed
here before of the auncyent
dukes of Guerles / & howe
the eldeſt ſonne of the duke
of Guerl
                  •
               s (of whome I
treat at this preſent tyme)
was maryed to the doughter
of Berthalce of Malynes / therby to bringe
him out of daunger / and to redeme againe his

herytage / the whiche was in ſore trouble before.
and the duke of Guerles ſonne to the duke
of Iulyers to entertayne and to kepe ye towne
of Graue agaynſt the brabanſoys / as he had
cauſe and iuſte tytle. Whan he ſawe howe he
coulde nat gette agayne his thre caſtels / Gauleth / 
Buth / and Nulle on the ryuer of Muſe / 
pertaynynge to his herytage / and to the countrey
of Guerles / thought than to attrybute the
towne of Graue to his herytage for euer. this
duke had a baſtarde doughter / maryed to the
ſonne of the lord Bruke / who was enherytour
to the towne of Graue. So there was an amyable
treatye bytwene them / as bytwene the fader
and the ſonne. and there the lorde of Bruke
gaue the towne and ſygnory of Graue to the
duke of Guerles / in preſence of the knyghtes
of Guerles and Iuliers. and for that cauſe the
duke of Guerles dyd recompence the lorde of
Bruke with the landes of Breſde / on the ryuer
of Lighen in the duchy of Guerles / marchyng
on the countrey of Holande aboue Brabaunte.
At this towne of Breſde there was a
fayre caſtell / and the towne great and profytable / 
how be it the towne of Graue was better.
This the duke of Guerles dyd to the entent to
haue a iuſte tytle to kepe the towne of Graue
agaynſt the brabanſoys. The duches of Brabant
and the brabanſoys ſaid / howe the lorde
of Bruke had it but to pledge / and that they
myght quyte it out whan they wolde / but the
duke of Guerles ſayd nayetherto. By reaſon
wherof the warre moued. So that in the moneth
of May / the brabanſoys came and layde
ſyege to the towne of Graue / with many lordes / 
knyghtes / and ſquyers / and with the puyſſaunce
of other good townes in Brabante.
And thyder they brought engyns / ſpringals / 
and other habylimentes of warre. They were
a .xl. thouſande one and other / there was ſkrymyſſhynge
dayly. The towne of Graue ſtandeth
on the ryuer of Mueſe on the ſyde of Brabante / 
and there is a bridge ouer the ryuer to
go in to the countrey of Guerles. At this ſiege
euery thynge was plenty / and as good chepe
of euery thynge / as though they had been before
Bruſels. Euery day there was ſkrymyſſhynge
at the barryers of Graue / of ſuche as
wolde aduenture them ſelfe. Sometyme they
were put a backe / and ſome tyme they droue
their enemyes in to their towne / as chaunce
of aduenture fell. The duke of Guerles was
well infourmed of this ſiege. He laye a foure
leages fro Nymarſe / and wrote often tymes
in to Englande / where he truſted to haue ſocoure
by reaſon of the englyſſhe army / wherof
the erle of Arundell was capytayne on the ſee / 
as ſone as wynde and wether wyll ſerue them.
to come to Guerles to reyſe the ſyege before
Graue. The duke of Guerles knewe well that
the towne of Graue was ſtrong and well forty
fyed / ſo that he thought it coulde nat be wonne
by none aſſaute / but outher by trayſon or by
treatye. He truſted theym of Gruae to be ſure
and faythfull to hym. Thus the ſiege endured
longe before Grane. And the erle of Arundels
army was on the ſee / and tooke no lande / but
ſtyll kepte on the fronters of Normandy / So
that the normans fro agaynſt Mounte ſaynte
Mychell / and downe alonge to Depe to ſaynt
Valery and to Croty / were nat well aſſured
wherto they ſhuld take hede. The portes and
hauens of Normandy were refreſſhed by the
frenche kynge / with good men of armes and
croſe bowes / to reſyſte agaynſte all parelles.
And by the marſhall of Blankewyll was ſette
in the towne of Carentyne / ſtandyge on the ſee
(whiche before of olde tyme pertayned to the
herytage of kynge Charles of Nauerre) the
lorde of Ambre and the lorde Coucy / two gret
lordes of Normandy. And the Conſtable of
Fraunce toke the towne of ſaynte Malo and
the towne of ſaynte Mathews / and as ſoone
as they knewe that the englyſſhe men were on
the ſee / they ſette men in to thoſe townes in the
name of the frenche kyng. In this ſeaſon they
thought ſurely to haue open warre with the
duke of Bretayne / for the knyghtes and ſquyers
ſayde / that the armye on the ſee of the englyſſhmen
were ſente thyder for none other purpoſe / 
but ſente for by the duke of Bretayne to
lande in his countrey. They ſayd it was none
other lykely / for alwayes the ſhyppes kepte on
the coſte of Bretaygne / without force of wetherſome
tyme cauſed them to departe. yet alwayes
breuely they retourned agayne to the
ſame coſte.
            yE haue herde here before / howe the
duke of Lācaſtre was departed out
of the realmes of Caſtyle and Portugale.
the imagynacyons that he had turned
hym to great dyſpleaſure / for he ſawe well his
buſyneſſe was ſore troubled and darked / as

fortune often tymes falleth in ſondrie ꝑſons / 
ſomtyme good ſomtyme yuell / whan it is leſt
thought on. For whan the duke of Lancaſtre
departed out of the realme of Englande / acō
               panyed
with good mē of armes and archers
he thought than to haue ſped otherwiſe than
he dyde. He ſawe and herde / howe that in xv.
dayes he had loſte all Galyce / whiche was a
long ſeaſon or he had won it / the ſpace of xvi.
wekes. And beſyde that his men deed & ſparcled
abrode / ſome here and ſōe there / and hoped
of no conforte out of Englāde / for the Englyſſhmen
were wery of the warre of Spaygne.
They thought it ouer long and farre of
fro them. So the duke of Lancaſtre thought
his buſyneſſe in a harde caſe / ſeyng no comforte / 
he ſpake lytell but he thought moche
more. In his ymaginacyon he lyconed his
iourney to the voiage that the duke of Aniou
made in to the realme of Naples: For whan
he departed out of the realme of Fraunce / he
was well furnyſſhed of all maner of thyng / 
and wente with great richeſſe / puiſſaunce / &
a great nombre of noble men of armes knightes
and ſ
                  ••
               uiers: & at the ende all were ſlayne
and loſt. Thus the duke of Lancaſtre reckoned
his v
                  •
               yage to come to nothynge / by reaſon
of ſuche diſconforte as he had. The erle
of Foiz / Who was in his countre of Bierne / 
and was eight ſage and ymaginatyue / ſayd
and accompeed the duke of Lacaſters vyage
but loſt / as inrecoueryng of the realme of Caſtyle / 
whiche he chalenged. The duke of Lacaſtre
who was a ſage and a wiſe prince / and
valyaunt amonge all his diſconfytures / yet
ſomtyme he toke cōforte to hym ſelfe. I ſhall
ſhewe you howe and by what meanes.
            He ſawe well he had a fayre doughter by
the lady Cuſtaunce his wyfe / doughter to
done Peter kyng of Caſtyle / in whoſe right
and clayme he made his warre in Caſtyle.
He thought thoughe fortune were agaynſt
hym at that tyme / yet it myght tourne good
to his doughter / who was fayre and yonge / 
for ſhe had ryght to the heritage of Caſtyle / 
by reaſon of her mother. and thought yt ſome
valyaunt man of Fraunce wolde be gladde
to couet to haue her in maryage / as well for
the right that ſhe hadde to the realme of Caſtyle / 
as for her hyghe lynage: For it myght
well be ſayde / that her extraction was of the
hygheſt lynage of Chriſtendome. Wherfore
the duke of Lācaſtre wolde gladly haue had
ſome treatie of mariage with ſome noble mā
of Fraunce. He knewe well the Frēche kyng
had a yong brother called the duke of Towrayne / 
who he thought ſhulde be able to recouer
his doughters ryght in Caſtyle: For he
knewe well that the puyſſaunce of Fraunce
helde in his aduerſaries / in the herytage of
Caſtile. wherfore he thought yt if they wolde
take his parte / they myght lightly putte his
doughter in poſſeſſyon of the realme of Caſtyle / 
if he myght marry her to the Frenche
kynges brother.

               ON this ymaginacyon reſted the

(as ye haue herde here before) ye
duke of Berrey and his ſonne were wodowers
bothe their wyues deed. This mater I
the auctour of this boke knewe of ſuretie / for
the ſame tyme I was on the fronters of Berrey

the right honorable lorde Guy erle of Bloys
by whom and at his deſyre / I folowed the cō
               tynuaūce
of this hiſtorie. The duke of Berrey
ſet all his entencion and pleaſure to be agayne
maryed: And oftē tymes he wolde ſay
among his men / howe that a lorde was lytell
worthe without a lady / nor another mā with
out a wyfe. Than ſome of his coūſayle ſayd
to hym. Sir marry agayne your ſon / therby

ſore: and than to ſuche as were of his ſecrete
counſayle / he ſayd. ye ſpeke to mary Iohan
my ſonne to my coſyn the duke of Lancaſters
doughter by ſaynt Denyce ye haue well
deuyſed but ſhe ſhulde be a good wyfe for
our ſelfe and ſhortely I ſhall write to our coſyn
the duke of Lancaſtre: He is at Bayone
as I am enformed / I wolde ſende hym worde
howe I ſhall ſende ſhortely to hym ſome
of my counſayle to treate of this maryage:
But I ſaye nat for my ſonne / I ſhall marry
hym in ſome other place. Whan his coūſayle
herde hym ſaye ſo they ſmyled / Than ye duke
demaunded wherat they ſmiled. Sir ꝙ they
we laught / at that ye had rather haue a good
tourne your ſelfe than your ſonne ſhulde. by
my faythe ꝙ the duke and good reaſon why:
For my fayre coſyn of Lancaſtre wyll nat ſo
ſoone agre to my ſonne as to my ſelfe. Than
incontynent letters were written in to highe
Gaſcoyne to Bayon to the duke of Lācaſtre / 
and ſente by honourable meſſangers. Whan
they came to ye duke they delyuered their letters.
The duke toke and reed thē / and whan
he had well parceyued theffecte of the mater / 
he was right ioyfull and made good chere to
the meſſāgers and ſhewed that he was well
content therwith / and wrote agayne by them
other letters ryght amiably. Certifyeng the
duke of Berrey howe he was right ioyfull of
his letters. Theſe meſſangers returned and
foūde their lorde in Poitou / preparyng hym
ſelfe to go in to Fraunce: for the Frēche kyng
and the duke of Burgoyne had ſent for hym / 
for to cōmune of the ſtate of Bretayne. Than
he oppned the letters that his coſyn the duke
of Lancaſtre had ſente hym / and had ioye of
the anſwere / & thought ſurely to purſue the
matter to effecte but he myght nat leaue his
voyage in to Fraunce and ſo went thyder as
ſhortely as he coulde. Thanne he wrote to a
knyght of his called ſir Helyon of Lignacke
who as than was ſeneſchall of Rochell / and
of the countre of Rocheloys. Cōmaundyng
hym that incou
                  •
               ynent on the ſight of his letters
he to ſette all thyng there in good order
and than to come to hym to Parys withoute
fayle. Whan ſir Helyon of Lignac who was
at Rochell vnderſtode thoſe tidynges / & parceyued
by the duke of Berreys letters / howe
he was ſent for in all haſt / he made hym redy / 
and in his abſence he made two capitayns at
Rochell / two valyaunt men to be gouerners
of all Rocheloys. They were of the countre
of Becaulſe / the one called ſir Peter of yon / &
the other ſir Peter of Tayllepy. This done
ſir Helyon tooke his waye in to Fraunce the
ſhorteſt way he coude / for he knewe nat what
the duke wolde do with hym / that he ſente for
hym ſo haſtely.
            NOwe let vs ſōwhat ſpeke of the duke
of Lancaſtre who was at Bayon / and
had great ymaginacions of yt buſyneſſe that
his coſyn the duke of Berrey had written to
hym of. Firſt he wolde nat that it ſhulde be
hydden but rather publyſſhed abrode / to the
entent that his ennemyes ſhulde knowe it / &
ſpecially in the houſe of kynge Iohan of Caſtyle.
And ſo the duke of Lancaſtre wrote to
dyuers / and ſent them the copye of the duke
of Berreys letters: Shewynge by his writyng / 
that he had great affectyon to treate of
the maryage / bytwene his doughter and the
duke of Berry. Firſt he ſent his letters to the
erle of Foiz / bycauſe he knewe well yt to the
erles houſe prepared all maner of gentylmen
knightes and ſquyers / as well cōmyng & goynge
to the kyng of Spayne / as on pylgrimage
to ſaynt Iames. Alſo he wrote to the
kyng of Nauer / who had to his wyfe ye kyng
of Caſtels ſuſter / and had by her many chyldren:
to thentent that the brute therof ſhulde
the better be certifyed in the kyng of Caſtels
court / rather than by flyeng wordes. alſo the
duke wrote of his mater to the kyng of Portugale / 
but he wrote no worde therof ī to England
to the kyng nor to his bretherne / for he
knewe well he ſhulde haue no thanke for his
enterprice / as they were nat content in dede / 
(as ye ſhall here after) whan ye mater requyreth
it. In the meane ſeaſon we ſhall ſpeke
of other maters / as of the duke of Bretayne / 
the mater lyeth there after.
            WHan the duke of Berrey was come
into Fraunce to the kyng and to the
duke of Burgoyne his brother / and
to other of his counſayle: As the byſſhoppe
of Langers / the byſſhoppe of Laon / ye lorde
of Coucy / and other barons of Fraūce / than

beyng thereof the kynges ſecrete counſayle.
They had many metynges to cōmune toguyder / 
as well of the ſtate of Guerles (whyder
the kyng had great affection to go) as of the
duke of Bretaygne / whom they coude bring
to no reaſon / nor wolde nat obey / nor wyſte
nat whom to ſende to hym that he wolde beleue / 
for there hadde ben many valyant men
and ſage with hym / but all that aueyled nothyng / 
for they coude bring nothyng to paſſe
as they deſyred / wherof the kyng & his counſaile
was ſore troubled. For they vnderſtode
well that the duke of Bretaygne had all that
wynter prouyded and fortifyed his townes
and caſtelles / and ſhewed howe by lykehode
he hadde rather haue warre than peace: and
the wyſeſt of the counſayle ſayd. We ſpeke of
goynge in to Almayne / but we ought rather
to ſpeke of goynge in to Bretaygne / and to
putte downe the duke there / who is ſo highe
mynded that he wyll here no reaſone / and is
alwayes agaynſt the crowne of Fraūce / and
diſdayneth to be obedyent thervnto. we ſhal
haue no reaſon of hym without we force him
therto: For and if he be ſuffred he wyll be to
preſumptuous he feareth no man / nor he loueth
nor prayſeth no man but hym ſelfe / this
is a clere caſe. If the kynge go in to Almaygne
and leaue his realme bare of men / as he
muſte do if he go thyder / The duke of Bretaigne
than wyll ſuffre the Engliſſhe men to
come in to his countrey / & ſo entre in to Fraū
               ce.
The apparaunce herof is great / for there
is all redy a great army of archers on the ſee
and they kepe ſtyll on the coſte of Bretaygne
for if wynde and wether putte theym of / yet
euer they drawe thyder agayne / & lyeth there
at ancre / beſemyng taryeng tyll the warre be
opyn / Wherfore we thynke it were good yet
to ſende agayne to the duke / the biſſhoppe of
Langers and the erle of ſaynt Poule / for the
duke and the erle haue maryed two ſuſters.
Naye ſirs nat ſo ꝙ maiſter yues / who was
a very Breton. If ye wyll ſende to the duke
agayne / ye can not ſende one more agreable
to hym than the lorde of Coucy / for in lykewyſe
they haue maryed two ſuſters / & haue
loued marueylouſly togyder / and haue euer
written eche to other. Fayre brother / & with
the lorde of Coucy ſende whom ye wyll. well
quod the duke of Burgoyne: Maiſter yues / 
ſithe ye haue begon name you the reſt. Sir / 
with right a good wyll ſithe it pleaſeth you / 
With the lorde of Coucy ſende ſir Iohan of
Vyen and the lorde de la Ryuer. Theſe be ſuche
thre lordes as ſhall bring hym to reaſon / 
if he wyll euer come to any. Thus let it be ꝙ
the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne. than
they were apoynted and charged what they
ſhulde ſaye / & whervpon they ſhulde groude
their mater / and to handell hym by fayre wordes.
Thus they taryed a certayne ſpace or
they departed fro Parys. The duke of Bretayne
knewe well of their comyng or they deꝑted
fro Parys / but he coude nat tell whan.
And he ſawe well the mater touched highlye
in that the lorde of Coucy came. The duke
had many ymaginacyons on that mater and
diſcouered his mynde to certayne of his coū
               ſayle:
as the lorde of Mountbouchier / & demaunded
counſayle of hym and of other / and
ſayd. Sirs / I here as the brute rōueth / that
the duke of Lācaſtre ſhulde mary his doughter
in to Fraunce to the duke of Berrey: and
the mater is ſo forwarde / that ſir Helyon of
Lignacke is goyng to the duke to Bayon / &
the duke greatly enclyneth to this maryage / 
wherof I haue great marueyle / for my fayre
brother of Lancaſtre hath nat written to me
therof / ſo that I knowe nothyng of the mater
but by heryng ſaye: He was nat accuſtomed
ſo to do / for in all his maters touchyng Fraū
               ce / 
he was wount to write to me. than his coū
               ſayle
anſwered and ſaid. Sir / if it be thus / it
muſt behoue you to chaūge your purpoſe / or
els it ſhalbe greatly to your loſſe and daunger / 
and bring your coūtre in to warre / whiche
were good to eſchewe: For ye nede nat to
make warre ſythe ye maye be in peace / yea?
and deſyred therto. Alſo my lady your wy
                  •
               e
is great with chylde / the whiche ye ought to
regarde. The kynge of Nauer can but tytell
ayde you / for he hath ynoughe to do for hym
ſelfe. Alſo the duke of Lācaſtre who is a ſage
and a valyant prince (as it is ſayd) ſhall mary
his doughter to the duke of Berrey. This
ſhalbe a gret begynnyng to entre in to a treatie
of peace bytwene Englande and Fraūce / 
or elles a longe truſe: And by reaſon therof ye
ſhall ſe at the ende the kyng of Caſtell putte
out of his realme / as they haue kepte hym in
and the rather if the duke of Lancaſtre and
the Englyſſhe men be agreed with hym: and
alſo it is of trouthe / that the lorde Coucye

admyrall of Fraunce and the lorde de la Ryuer / 
are cōmyng hyder. ye maye well knowe
that is for ſome great cauſe touchynge the
kyng / who buſyeth hym ſelfe for his cōſtable
and for his Realme. And by lykelyhode the
kynge and his vncles wyll knowe preſiſely
what ye wyll do / and wheder ye wyll kepe
ſtyll your opinyon or nat. And if ye kepe ſtyll
your purpoſe / it is to be ymagined / that the
great armye that is prepared for to go in to
Guerles ſhall tourne agaynſt you. Nowe
remembre well what conforte ye are likely to
haue yf ye haue warre with Fraunce / whiche
ye are mooſt lykely to haue if the duke of
Lancaſter marry his doughter into Fraūce / 
as be ſemyng he wyll / for he can nat beſtowe
her better to recouer her herytage. Alſo ye
knowe well that the mooſt parte of the prelates / 
barons / knyghtes and ſquyers / and cyties
and good townes / are in maner ye agaynſt
you. Therfore ſir / ſithe ye demaunde counſayle
of vs / We ſaye that ye had neuer ſo moche
cauſe to aduyſe you (as ye haue nowe).
Therfore putte to your hande to kepe well
your herytage / whiche hath coſt the ſhedyng
of ſo moche blode / ſweate / and traueyle: and
refrayne ſomwhat your yre and hatered. We
knowe well ye beare great dyſpleaſure to ſir
Olyuer Clyſſon. he hath done you many diſpleaſures / 
and ye hym / & paraduenture may
do / though he be nat lyke vnto you. the Frē
               che
kynge and his vncles wyll maynteygne
hym agaynſt you / for he ſhall he Conſtable.
And if kynge Charles that laſte dyed (who
loued hym ſo well) hadde lyued / and ye done
as ye haue done: We knowe well it ſhulde
rather haue coſt the kynge halfe his realme / 
thanne he wolde haue ſuffred it. But kynge
Charles his ſonne is yonge / he taketh nat 
                  •
               o
good hede to all maters nowe / as he wolde
do tenne yeres here after. He cometh on and
ye ſhall go. If ye encre in to a newe warre agaynſt
the Frenche men (beſyde all that we
haue ſhewed you) ye ſhall do it without our
counſayle and without the counſayle of any
man that loueth you. It behoueth you to diſſemule
whatſoeuer ye purpoſe to do here after.
What nede you to kepe the thre caſtelles
parteynyng to ſir Olyuer of Clyſſons herytage / 
after the maner toke them? Wheder
it be ſo ye haue peace or warre / they ſhall
coſte you more the kepynge of theym in thre
yeres / than they ſhall profyte you in twelue
yeres. Sir delyuer them agayne out of your
handes without any deſyre / and whan the renome
therof ſpredeth abrode (as there is nothynge
done but it wyll be knowen) yt without
cōſtreynt ye haue delyuered them of your
owne mynde / ye ſhall therby attemper and
molifye euery mannes diſpleaſure / & it ſhall
greatlye pleaſe the duke of Burgoyne / who
ye knowe well hath nat done ſo moche agaynſt
you as he myght / in all your buſyneſſe.
And that is by the meanes of the good lady
his wyfe your coſyn / She hath many fayre
chyldren who are nexte of blode to you. therfore
ſir / conſyder fro whens ye came and are
iſſued / departe nat farre of fro thens that ye
ought to approche nere it were follye / in Englande
ye hadde neuer thyng to do. Alſo the
Englyſſhmen haue ynoughe to do amonge
themſelfe. They ſhewe you fayre ſemblaunt
of loue / and promyſe to do for you all yt they

            ¶Howe the duke of Bretayne delyuered

Cap. C.xxviii.
            WHan the duke of Bretayne
had herde his counſayle
ſpeke / and caſt ſo many
reaſonable doubtes / he
was abaſſhed / and ſtoode
ſtyll a ſeaſon without ſpekynge
of any worde / leanyng
in a wyndowe lokyng downe in to the
courte / his counſayle beyng aboute hym / he
ſtode in a great ſtudy: at laſt he tourned and

ſaid. ſirs / I ſe well that ye haue highly coū
               ſayled
me / and I ſe well I haue nede of nothynge
ſo moche as of good counſayle: But
howe may any loue be noriſſhed / where is no
thyng but hate? Howe maye I loue Olyuer
of Clyſſon / that hath done me ſo many dyſpleaſures / 
Wherfore of all the thynges that
euer I dyde in this worlde / I mooſt repente
me of that I dyd nat put hym to dethe whan
I had hym in my caſtell of Ermyne? In the
name of god ſir quod they of his counſayle / 
(if he had ben ſlayne) but ye ought nat to haue
raunſomed hym / nor taken his herytage.
For Iohan of Bretayne and the Vycount of
Rohers ſonne be his heyres / and herytours
to all his landes: for his doughters are their
wyues. Wherfore they wolde haue entred in
to the heritage as their owne / for their reſort
is in to the Parlyament chambre at Parys.
For ye haue receyued all redy great blame in
Fraunce for that ye haue done / and kepynge
of the thre caſtelles. The conſtable hath entred
his quarell and plee agaynſt you in the
parlyament houſe of Parys / and there ſentence
wyll be gyuen agaynſt you / for there is
none to anſwere for you agaynſt any artycle
that the Conſtable hath layde agaynſt you.
Than ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon and his heyres
ſhall haue iuſte cauſe and quarell to make
warre agaynſt you in his owne tytell. And
if the kynge with other of your owne countrey
of Bretayne wyll make you warre and
ayde your ennemyes / ye haue nede than̄e to
haue more puyſſaunce to defende you / thaſie
we can ſe that ye are lyke to haue. Wherfore
ſir / while the plee hangeth / ye were beſt to delyuer
agayne the thre caſtelles and haue thā
               ke / 
than to abyde the ſentence to be gyuen agaynſt
you. Sir agre / for ſuche dommages
as ye haue done as well as ye canne / therby
ſhall you wade out of all ſclaundre / the whiche
a prince ought to dout for his diſhonour
And ſir / cōferme you to peace / and contynue
in loue with them that ye ought to do / that is
the Frenche kynge your ſoueraygne and naturall
lorde / and my lorde the duke of Burgoyne
and your coſyns his chyldren. ye may
take enſample by that ye haue ſene in youre
dayes: your coſyn germayne therle of Flaū
               ders / 
who was a myghte prince and a ſage / 
yet by inſydētes in thende of his dayes there
fell to hym ſuche marueylous aduentures / yt
without he had humyled hym ſelfe to the frē
               che
kynge / to his vncles / and to the nobles of
the realme he had loſte his herytage / and by
their ayde and helpe he recouered it. Well
ſirs quod the duke / ſithe I haue demaunded
counſayle it behoueth me to take it / and I accepte
your wordes that ye haue ſpoken.
            THis mater wente ſo forwarde that
the duke of Bretayyne / who was in
poſſeſſyon of the thre caſtelles of the
conſtables (as ye haue herde here before) he
ſent for his men that was in them / and rydde
his handes clene of them: and there were ſtablyſſhed
men in them for the conſtable: But
this reſtytuicion was nat ſuffycient in the opynion
of the Frenche kynges counſayle / wt
               out
the duke reſtored agayne the money that
he hadde taken of the Conſtable: and beſyde
that the duke to come perſonally to the kyng
to Parys to make his excuſe before all the peres
of the realme / and to abyde on the mendes
makynge / ſuche as the kyng and his coū
               ſayle
ſhulde iudge by good delyberacion.
And whan the knowledge of the reſtytucion
of theſe caſtels was come to the lorde of Coucye / 
and to the other lordes that were apoynted
to go in to Bretaygne to the duke. Than
the lorde of Coucy ſayde to his company.
Sirs / we haue the leſſe to do / I beleue the
duke wyll gyue credence to vs whan he heareth
vs ſpeke. I was enfourmed that before
theſe thre barons departed fro Parys / the dukes
of Berrey and of Bourgoyne had them
in counſayle and ſayde. Sirs / ye muſte entreate
the duke of Bretaygne with fayre and
ſwete wordes / & nat rigorouſly. And ſhewe
hym howe ye duke of Bourgoyne wolde that
he ſhulde come to Parys to the kyng: but at
leeſt ſhewe hym howe he muſt come to the
halfe way to the towne of Bloyes / and there
we ſhall mete with hym and ſpeke toguyder
Theſe thre lordes ſaid they wolde do as they
were cōmaūded. They rode forthe & came to
the cytie of Rennes in Bretayne / & there demaūded
tidinges of the duke / and it was ſhewed
them howe he was at Wannes and than
they rode tyhder. Their cōmynge was anon
knowen in the dukes court / for they had ſent
before their herbygers to take vp their lodgynges.
The duke had about hym his counſayle

& greate lordes / ſuche as he truſted moſt
the more honourably to receyue theſe lordes.
Whan they entred in to the towne of Wānes
they had good chere / and lordes and knyghtes
of the dukes mette them / and ſpecially the
lorde de la Wall. there they a lyghted at their
lodgynges & refreſſhed them ſelfe / and after
mounted on their horſes and rode to the dukes
caſtell called la Mote / where they foūde
the duke who came agaynſt them / and receyued
thē right ioyouſly and ſayd: Howe they
were all right hertely welcome / and toke the
lorde of Coucy by the hande / and made hym
good chere & ſayde. Fayre brother ye be welcome / 
I am gladde to ſe you in Bretayne. I
ſhall ſhewe you ſporte of huntyng at hartes
and flyeng with haukes or we deꝑte a ſōdre.
Sir quod the lorde of Coucy I thanke you / 
I and my company ſhall be gladde to ſe it.
There was ſhewed bytwene them great lykelyhode
of loue: and the duke brought hym
to his chambre / ſportyng and talkyng of many
ydell matters / as lordes do often tymes
whan they mete / and haue nat ſene toguyder
longe before / they wyll fynde many ſondrie
paſtymes. and ſpecially I knewe four lordes
the beſt entertayners of all other that euer I
knewe / That was the duke of Brabant / the
erle of Foiz / the erle of Sauoy / and in eſpeciall
the lorde of Coucy: For accordynge to
myne aduyſe in all goodly paſtymes he was
a ſouerayne maiſter 
                  •
                whiche brute he bare amonge
all lordes and ladyes / in Fraunce / in
Englande / in Almaygne in Lombardy / and
in all places where as he had ben conuerſant
And in his tyme he had been ſore traueyled &
ſene moche in the worlde: and alſo he was naturally
enclyned to be gentyll. & thus whyle
theſe lordes were mery talkynge toguyder / 
there was brought ſpyces and wyne and ſo
they dranke / and than toke their leaues and
retourned to their lodgynges. Thus the mater
went for the ye fyrſt day / without makyng
of any mencyon of any thyng that they were
come for.
            NOwe let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of ſir Helyon
of Lygnacke / whom the duke of
Berrey hadde ſent to the duke of Lancaſtre.
The knyght came to Bayon and a lyghted
at his lodgynge / and apparelled hymſelfe to
go and ſpeke with the duke of Lācaſtre / who
knewe well of his cōmyng / and ſent right honourably
two of his knyghtes to mete with
hym / and they brought hym to the duke. And
whan ſir Helyon was in the dukes preſens
he kneled downe / and ſaluted hym as it aperteyned.
The duke receyued hym right honorably
and tooke hym vp in his armes / & toke
hym by ye hande and ledde hym in to his chā
               bre / 
for he mette hym in the hall. Thanne the
knyght delyuered his letters fro the duke of
Berry. The duke reed them and thanne he
drewe to ſir Helyon / and the knight declared
to him the cauſe of his cōmyng. Than the duke
anſwered right courteſly and ſayd. Sir / 
ye be right welcome / and ſayd howe the mater
was weyghtie that he was cōe for / wherfore
it requyred counſaile and delyberacion.
Thus ſir Helyon taryed at Bayon with the
duke of Lancaſtre more than a moneth / and
alwayes he was ſerued with fayre wordes:
And the duke alwayes foded hym forthe and
made ſemblant that he had great affection to
treate for this mariage with the duke of Berrey / 
Howe be it the trouthe was cōtrary / for
all that he ſhewed was but diſſymulacion.
and the cauſe that he was helde there ſo long
with hym / was for none other thing / but that
the brute therof myght ronne abrode / and ſpecially
in to ye realme of Caſtyle / for there lay
all his affection: The duke ſayde to ſir Helyon.
Sir / if I treat with the duke of Berrey
to haue my doughter in maryage / than̄e
he muſt ioyne with me with all his puyſaūce
to encounter myne aduerſaries of Spayne / 
If he wyll recouer the heritage of my doughter / 
whom he ſhulde haue to wyfe: Than ſir
Helyon ſayd. Sir / I haue no charge to confyrme
any thynge ſo forwarde. But ſir / if it
pleaſe you or I deꝑte / ye maye write all your
pleaſure by me / and I ſhall returne & ſhewe
my lorde the duke of Berrey all your entent:
And I am ſure (he hath ſuche affection to the
mater) he wyll agree to euery thynge that he
may do by reaſon. I deſyre no more quod the
duke of Lancaſtre. Thus ſir Helyon of Lygnacke
taryed a ſeaſon at Bayon / and
had good chere made hym by
the dukes cōmaundement.

the duke of Berrey and the duke of Lancaſtre
The duke of Berrey wolde haue in maryage
the lady Katheryne / doughter to the duke of
Lancaſtre and to the lady Cuſtance his wyfe.
And if this maryage take effecte (as it is lyke
to do) it ſhalbe a great alyaunce: For the
duke of Berrey is nowe / as one of the chiefe
rulers in the realme of Fraunce / and is vncle
to the kyng. He ſhalbe beleued what ſoeuer
he ſaye or purpoſe to do (as it is reaſon) wheder
is be by meanes of peace or longe truſe / 
On the other parte / the duke of Lancaſtre is
eldeſt of all his bretherne / that be vncles to
the kyng. He ſhall alſo be beleued / for he is
ſage and puyſſaūt: and by that it ſemeth the
Englyſſhmen are wery of the warre. This
maryage bytwene the Duke of Lancaſters
doughter and the duke of Berrey / is lykely
to be a great meane to make a good peace bytwene
Fraūce and Englande / and than ſhal
we here ſticke ſtyll in the warre / for the duke
of Lācaſtre wyll folowe and purſue his chalenge
of the realme of Caſtyle / and the right
yt he hath by his wyfe he ſhall gyue it to his
doughter / and ſo than ſhall we haue warre
bothe with Fraunce and Englande. Theſe
doutes were layde to the kynge of Caſtyle.
And at that tyme all the Frenchmen that had
ſerued long in the realme of Caſtyle were retourned
in to Fraunce: and the chiefe of the
kynge of Caſtyls counſayle ſayd to hym. ſir
take hede to vs. ye neuer had ſo great nede of
good counſayle / as ye haue at this preſente
tyme. For ſir / a peryllousmyſt is lyke to be
engendred bytwene you and the duke of Lā
               caſtre / 
and that ſhall come by the meanes of
Fraūce. Howe ſo quod the kyng / howe may
that be? In the name of god ſir quod they / 
the brute and renome ſpredeth throughe all
this countrey / and els where / howe the duke
of Berrey ſhall mary the duke of Lācaſters
doughter. And ſir / ye maye be ſure that ſhall
nat be / but by the meanes of a great alyaūce:
ſo that therby here after / ye maye be as farre
caſt behynde by them / as ye haue ben auaunced.
Whan the kyng of Caſtyle knewe thoſe
tidynges he was right penſyue / & ſawe well
howe his counſayle ſhewed hym the trouthe
Than he demaunded rounſayle of them that
he truſted beſt / howe he ſhulde perceuer and
deale in all his buſyneſſe / and they counſayled
hym well and truely / as the mater requyred:
as I ſhall ſhewe you.
            YE knowe well (as ye haue herde before
in this hyſtorie) Howe kynge
Henry of Spaygne made a peace / 
with Peter kynge of Arragone / on the full
poyntment that the kyng of Arragon ſhulde
gyue his doughter in maryage to the kynge
of Caſtyle. This was Iohan who is nowe
kyng: and by this coniunction of maryage / 
they were ī peace and their realmes. Of this
Iohan ſonne to Henry / and of the doughter
of Arragon there came a ſonne. Than dyed
the lady: and after the dethe of kynge Henry
of Caſtyle / this kyng Iohan by the coūſaile
of his men maried agayne the lady Beatrice
doughter to Fernando kynge of Portugale / 
and they hadde a ſonne called Henry / he was
but yonge. Than the counſayle of Caſtyle
ſayd to the kyng. Sir / we ſe in all theſe doutes
but one remedy. What is that quod kyng
Iohan? Sir we ſhall ſhewe you quod they
your yong ſonne Henry may well breke this
maryage / bytwene the duke of Berrey and
the duke of Lancaſters doughter / for it is to
be beleued / that the duke of Lācaſtre and the
duches his wyfe / had rather marchant with
you and with your ſonne than with the duke
of Berrey. In the name of god ꝙ the kynge
ye ſaye well / I ſhall herken to this mater / I
thynke our people wyll lightly enclyne thervnto:
by that mariage we ſhulde haue peace

with Englande 
                  •
                bothe by lande and by water.
Therfore ſirs / thoſe out them that were
mete to go in our name to treate on this mater
with the duke of Lancaſtre. Sir ꝙ they / 
it is requiſyte that they be diſcrete perſones / 
and that the matter be wiſely handeled / and
in the ſecreteſt maner that maye be: to the entente
that ye ronne nat in the indignacyon of
the Frenche kynge. For nowe a dayes enuy
rayneth greatly / and ſooner reporte is made
of yuell than of good / and the yuell ſooner
reyſed vp than the good. For if they of Fraū
               ce
knowe that ye treate with the duke of Lā
               caſtre / 
the Frenche kynge and his counſayle
wyll demaūde whervpon ye treate with the
duke / by reaſone of the great alyaunce made
in tyme paſt / bytwene your father & Fraūce.
And alſo the Frenche men haue alwayes ſuſteyned

lette them be ſente for / and well enfourmed
what they ſhall ſay / they wolde or this tyme
haue treated for a peace but we wolde natte
here them. For the duke of Lancaſtre wolde
none other wyſe but that I ſhulde haue forſaken
the Crowne of Caſtyle / the whiche I
wyll neuer do. Than theſe thre were ſent for
to Burgus in Spayne where the kyng was
Than it was ſayd to them by the kynge and
his priu

               e counſayle. Sirs / ye muſte go to
Bayon to the duke of Lancaſtre and ſhewed
them all their inſtructions. They ſayde they
were redy to accomplyſſhe the kynges comman̄dement:
And ſo ſette forthe on their iourney 
                  •
               
nat in no gret eſtate but ſymply / for they
wolde nat be knowen that they wente to the
duke of Lācaſtre / as ambaſſadours to treate
for any alyaunce for they knewe nat howe to
ſpede. Thus they entred in to Nauerre and
came to Pampylona / and there founde the
kynge and the quene. Firſt they came thyder
bycauſe the quene was ſuſter to the kynge of
Caſtyle. There they hadde good chere / but
they nouther ſhewed the kyng nor the quene
where about they wente: And ſo paſſed thorough
the countrey by the mountayns of Roſeaulx
and entred in to Biſquay / and ſo rode
tyll they came to Bayon.
            WHan̄e they were come to the towne
of Bayon / ſir Helyon of Lignacke
was ſtyll there / who was ſente fro
the duke of Berrey (as ye haue herde here before)
But after the cōmynge of the caſtilyans
they taryed nat longe after / for frere don Fernando
the kynge of Caſtyls confeſſour came
to the duke of Lancaſtre / for he knewe hym
better than any of the other. He began ſomwhat
to breke the mater / & to ſhewe the cauſe
of their cōmynge. The duke opyned his eates
to his wordes / and was gladde to here
thoſe tidynges / and ſayde. Frere Fernando
ye be welcome. And the ſame day ſir Helyon
of Lignacke was delyuered. And as I vnderſtode / 
the duke accorded the ſame tyme to
a truſe on all partes. for ſuch as made warre
for hym in Acquitayne / Bygore / Thoulous / 
and other place / to endure vnto to the firſte
day of Maye / in the yere of our lorde god a
thouſande thre hundred fourſcore and nyne.
this truſe to contynue all the countrey to the
ryuer of Loyre / and no further. This trueſe
was concluded at the requeſt of the duke of
Berrey / to the entent that he myght ſende in
and out to the duke of Lancaſtre. For before
they of the fortreſſes of Mortaygne on ye ſee / 
of Bonteuyll / of Rouuergue / of Quercyn / 
of Pyergourt / and they on the ryuer of Garon / 
were people without mercy / they wolde
knowe no manne / wherfore theſe two dukes
accorded to this trueſe / the whiche was well
kepte. Whan ſir Helyon of Lignacke departed
fro ye duke there was great loue ſhewed / 
for the duke ſaid howe the mater pleaſed him
right well: Howe be it the duke ſayd playnlye
he wolde neuer marry his doughter in to
Fraunce / without the conſent and accorde of
the kyng of Englande his nephue. And alſo
by the agrement of the counſayle of Englāde
but he ſayd / he truſted ſo to order the mater / 
that all ſhulde do well. Thus ſir Helyon of
Lignacke departed and returned in to Fraū
               ce / 
and ſhewed the duke of Berrey his letters
that the duke of Lancaſtre had ſent him / 

and ſhewed hym by mouthe all the maner / 
howe euery thyng wente / and ſo ye duke was
well content. ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the
kynge of Caſtyls ambaſſadours / to whome
the duke of Lācaſtre gaue good eare & ſo dyd
the duches / for all their hertes and ymaginacions
lay euer on their chalenge of Spayn.
            THe duke made theſe ambaſſadours
good chere / they came before the duke
and the ducheſſe / and there ſhewed
their meſſage. firſt they treted for peace / 
and there the frere preached in the dukes chā

the ducheſſe preſent: And ſhe ſhewed the
duke the entent of all his wordes / for ye duke
vnderſtode hym nat parfitely: The lady vnderſtode
hym well / for in her youthe ſhe was
brought vp in Spaygne. The duke for all
that the mater of their cōmyng was pleaſaūt
to him / yet he diſcouered nat to haſtely his entente / 
but ſayd. Sirs / it wyll be very harde
to make peace in that place / where as great
hatered and warre is reſydent / and ſpecially
with them that be diſheryted and kepte from
their herytage: Sayeng / howe he wolde nat
leaue the warre withoute he myght haue the
crowne of Caſtyle / the whiche he ſayde was
his right: The frere and the biſſhoppe ſayd.
Sir / bytwene your right and ye ryght of the
kynge our lorde there is but one meane / and
we haue founde it / if it may pleaſe you. What
waye is that quod the duke? Sir quod they
it is this. ye haue by my lady youre wyfe a
feyre yonge lady to marry / and the kynge of
caſtile our ſouerayne lorde hath a feyre yong
ſonne / if they two myght mary toguyder the
realme of Caſtyle ſhulde be in peace / and all
that is your right ſhulde retourne to you. &
ſir / better can ye nat beſtowe your heyre who
is diſcēded of the right lyne of Caſtyle. The
entent ye arme you (fyght / aduenture youre
ſelfe / and traueyle your body) is all onely for
the right of your heyre. That is trewe ꝙ the
duke / but than I wyll that the coſtes yt I haue
ſuſteyned in the purſute there be recompē
               ſed.
For I wyll ye knowe it hath coſt me and
the realme of Englande / fyue hundred thouſande
frākes / wherof I wolde gladly ſe ſom
recoueraūce. Sir quod the frere / if our treatie
be agreable to you / we truſt to fynde ſuch
a meane that the mater ſhall take good effect
Well quod the duke ye be welcome / and how
ſoeuer it be or howe ſoeuer it ſhalbe / or I retourne
in to Englande (outher in to Caſtyle
or in to Fraunce) I ſhall mary my doughter
for I haue dyuers offres moued vnto me / but
maters of ſo great a weyght are nat lightly
cōcluded / at the firſt tyme. For my doughter
whome I repute (as rightfull enheritour to
ſpayne) I wyll knowe him well yt ſhall haue
her in maryage. that is but reaſon quod the
frere. Thus as I haue ſhewed you this treatie
began / bytwene the duke of Lācaſtre and
theſe parties / as well of Caſtyle as of Fraū
               ce.
He made euery partie good chere / & made
no full anſwere: but in his ymaginacion the
treatie of Spayne (the kynges ſonne to mary
his doughter) ſemed beſt to his purpoſe / 
bicauſe in tyme to come his doughter ſhulde

made good chere to
the French ambaſſadours
and ſpecially to the lorde
of Coucy. For as I was
enformed / he was ye chiefe
that brake the duke fro his purpoſe / by reaſon
of his fayre and ſwete wordes: Howe be
it the lorde Iohan of Vyen and the lorde dela
Ryuer dyde ryght well their deuoyre. but
often tymes great princes and lordes wyll ſoner
be entreated by one man / rather than by
another. Moche payne it was to cauſe the
duke of Bretayne to agre to go to the towne
of Bloys / to mete there the dukes of Berrey

and of Burgoyne / but he was brought thyder
by fayre wordes: And he ſayde / ſurely he
wolde go no further thanne to the towne of
Bloys / and the lorde of Couey ſayd he deſyred
nothynge elles. Theſe the lordes were
with the duke of Bretaynge certayne dayes / 
and than toke their leaues and retourned in
to Fraunce / and ſhewed the dukes of Berry
and of Burgoyne howe they hadde ſpedde.
Thervpon theſe two dukes made them redy
to go to Bloyes to mete there with the duke
of Bretaygne / and ſente thyder before to make
prouiſyon / as apertayned. Firſte thyder
came the duke of Berrey and he was lodged
in the Caſtell / and there he founde the counteſſe / 
her ſonne / and her doughter. They receyued
hym honourably. The erle Guye of
Bloys was as than in his owne countrey at
the caſtell Reygnaulte / and made no greate
counte of the commynge of the duke of Bretaygne / 
he thought it ſufficyent that his wife
and chyldren were there. Than thyder came
the duke of Burgoyne with a goodly trayne
and in his company came ſir Wyllm̄ of Heynaulte
and his ſonne erle of Oſtrenante / and
Iohan of Burgoyne ſonne to the duke called
erle of Neuers. The duke lodged alſo in
the caſtell / and there helde his eſtate. Than
after came the duke of Bretaygne with no
great trayne / other than of his houſe: He paſſed
nat a thre hūdred horſes / for his entēcyon
was / that whan he had ones ſene the two dukes
and ſpoken with them / to retourne in to
his owne countre / without goynge any further
in to Fraunce / But the entente of the other
two dukes was otherwiſe: for they ſaid
whyder he wolde or nat / he ſhulde go to Parys.
            THe duke of Bretaygne hym ſelfe lodged
in the caſtell of Bloyes / in a chanons
houſe of ſaynt Sauyour: and his men
lodged downe in the towne / & ſo dyd ye other

                and they thanked the duke of Bretayne
of his cōmyng to the towne of Bloyes: And
the duke anſwered and ſayde / howe he was
come thyder for the loue of them with great
payne (for he fayned hym ſelfe nat well at
eaſe) Than theſe two dukes fell in communynge
with the duke of Bretayne / ſhewyng
hym ſithe he was come ſo farr forwarde that
he had done nothyng without he went to Parys
to ſe the kynge / who greatly deſyred to ſe
hym. The duke of Bretaygne began greatlye
to excuſe hym ſelfe of that voyage / and
layde many reaſons / & ſayd howe he was nat
well at his caſe to make ſo longe a iourney / 
nor alſo he was nat accompanyed therafter.
Than he was ſwetely anſwered that ſauyng
his diſpleaſure / he ſhulde nede no great trayne
to go ſe his ſoueraygne lorde / and as for
his rydinge / he ſhulde lacke nouther chayre
nor lytter to labour at his eaſe / For they ſaid
he was bounde to do homage to the kynge / 
for as than he had nat done it before. The duke
ſayd (excuſynge hymſelfe) that whan the
kynge were come to his laufull age / and had
the hole Realme in his owne gouernaunce / 
than he wolde come to Parys (or whyder to
ſhulde pleaſe the kynge) and than do his homage
acordyng to reaſon: The other dukes
ſayd / that the kynge was of age & wyſdome
ſuffycient to receyue homage: and howe that
all other lordes of the realme excepte he / had
done their homage and made reliefe / affyrmynge
howe the kynge was .xxi. yere of age.
Whan the duke of Bretaygne ſawe howe his
excuſes coude nat be taken nor herde (ſayde)
Well ſirs / if I go to Parys it ſhalbe greatlye

For whan I come there / I ſhall fynde and

whom I can nat loue nor neuer dyde / nor he

wordes) My lordes / regarde well what inconuenyentes
ſhall enſue of my goynge thyder.
Sir ꝙ the duke of Burgoyne / fayre coſyn
haue ye no dout therin for we ſhall ſwere
ſolempnely to you / that withoute it ſhall be

Of this ſir ye ſhall be ſure / but ye ſhall ſe the
kynge who deſyreth to ſe you / and other lordes / 
knyghtes / and ſquyers of Fraunce / who
ſhall make you good chere. And whanne ye
haue done that ye loke for / ye ſhall retourne
agayne without peryll or dommage (Wherto
ſhulde I make longe proceſſe) So moche

the duke of Bretayne was deſyred with faire
wordes that he conſented to go to Parys / on

Mountforde ſhulde nat come in his preſēce / 
the whiche the dukes ſware faythfully to vpholde / 
and thervpon he ꝓmyſed to go to Parys.
A fyue dayes theſe dukes were at Bloyes / 
and eche of them feeſted other ryght nobly / 
and the coūteſſe and her chyldren in lyke

of Bretaygne and retourned to Parys: But
ſir Wylliam of Heynaulte retourned nat to
Parys with the duke of Burgoyne his faire

who made hym right good chere / and taryed
there a thre dayes / & than toke his leaue

conueyed hym in to the court where his
horſes were. and there mounted and ſo returned
to his lodgynge in the ſtrete of yt Harpe / 
and none taryed with hym of them that conueyed
hym / but ſuche as came with hym out
of Bretaygne to Parys.
            AFter all this the duke of Bretaygne
ſpake at leyſar with the kynge & his
vncles / ſo that euery man was well
contente with hym / and he tooke well euery
thynge that had ben promyſed to hym / for he
ſawe nouther the conſtable nor Iohn̄ of Bretayne.
Whan ye lordes ſawe that euery thyng
was in good ſtate / and that they neded nat
to doute the duke of Bretaygne / ſeynge they
had hym at Paris (for they thought he ſhulde
nat departe thens tyll he had done in maner / 
euery thyng as the kynge wolde) than it
was thought good tyme to ordeyne forth for
the voyage in to Guerles (whyder the kyng
had great affection to go) to ſubdue the duke
of Guerles / who had ſo ſhamfully defied the
kyng (the whiche cōſydred) was nat thoght
good to be ſuffred. Than it was ordayned / 
that the lorde of Coucy ſhulde drawe to the
marches of Rennes and Chalous in Champayn / 
and to regarde for the kynges paſſage
that waye / and to moue the knyghtes & ſquyers
in Bare and in Lorayne to go with him / 
whyder he wolde lede them / nat ſpekynge of
the kyng / but bearyng them in hande that he
wolde go to recouer his ryght in Auſtryche.
The lorde of Coucy thus departed fro Parys / 
and wente to Chalous in Champayne / 
and there taryed a moneth and retaygned on
all partes knyghtes and ſquyers ī Bare and
in Lorayne / in Champaygne / and in Retheloys.
And the Frēche kyng departed fro Parys
whan he had cōmuned with the duke of
Bretaygne of dyuers maters (and nat fully
accomplyſſhed) For the ſute in the courte of
Fraunce is longe whan they lyſte / and right
well they canne foode forthe the people to make
theym ſpende moche / and bringe lytell to
effecte. The kynge came to Mouſtreau on
faulte you / in the marcheſſe of Brie and Gaſtenoys / 
and there he helde his courte / and of
ten tymes chaſed hartes and other wylde beeſtes
in the foreſt of Brie. The ſame ſeaſone
there was a dede of armes done there / bitwene
an Engliſſhe knight who was there with
the duke of Irelande / called ſir Thom̄s Harpyngham / 

and ſir Iohan of Barres / wherof
great brute was made in Fraunce and other
places. Their chalenge was / fyue courſes
with a ſpeare / fyue ſtrokes with the ſworde / 
fyue with a daggar / and fyue with the axe:
and if any of their weapons brake than they
to gette newe / tyll their chalenge were accō
               plyſſhed.
Theſe two knyghtes on a day lept
on their horſes well armed / as appertayned
(The kynge and all other lordes beyng preſent
and moche people) and ranne toguyder
foure courſes ryght valiauntly (and as me
thought the vſage was than̄e / their Helmes
were tyed but with a lace / to the entente the
ſpeare ſhulde take no holde). the fyrſt courſe
ſir Iohan of Barres ſtrake the Englyſſhe
knyght on the targe / in ſuche wyſe / that he
bare hym ouer the horſe crope / ſo that he laye
ſtonyed on the grounde / and moche payne to
releue. Than they perfourmed forthe all the
reſte of their chalenge / in ſo goodly maner / 
that the kyng and all the other were well cō

who wente euer and ſcoured the ſee
The flete had layne at ancre more than a moneth
agaynſt the yſle of Breſhatte in Bretayne.
And there they herde tidynges / howe
the duke of Bretaygne was gone to Bloyes
to ſpeke with the dukes of Berrey & of Burgoyne / 
And howe they were ſo agreed / that
the duke was gone to Parys. And the renoeranne
throughe Bretaygne / howe the duke
hadde good chere of the Frenche kynge / and
was welcome to hym and to all his couſayle
at Parys / and ſhulde nat departe thens tyll
the maters were in good eſtate. Whanne the
erle of Arūdell herde thoſe tidynges he was
penſyue: and wente to counſayle what was
beſt to do / & whyder they were beſt to drawe
to enploye their ſeaſon. Than they determyned
to drawe to Rochellois though they had
no caſtelles there / yet they hadde men ynowe
there to kepe the Felde / and to abyde all the
puyſſaunce of Xaynton and of Poyctou / ſo
that they ſhulde ſignify their eſtate in to Auuergne
and in to Lymoſynne / ſo that they
myght ſende to paſſe throughe Bretaygne.
As than the treuſe was nat confyrmed on the
ryuer of Loyre: but they were a treatynge to
begynne the fyrſte daye of Auguſte. And ſir
Helyon of Lignacke was goyng or cōmyng
(as the erle of Arundell ymagined) outher
to the duke of Lancaſtre to Bayone / or elles
retournynge in to Fraunce. They hadde in
their nauye a Breton bretonaunt of the nacyon
of Wannes / ſeruaunt to ſir Wyllyam
Helmon / who coude ſpeke well foure maner
of languages / That is to ſaye / Bretyſſhe / 
Englyſſhe / Spaynyſſhe / and Frenche: and
gaue hym in commaundement to go a lande
and ſayde to hym. Go thou the mooſt preuyeſt
wayes thou canſte (thou knoweſt all the
preuy wayes of the countrey) and gette the

recommaunded to Perotte le Bernoys / and

to Perot that he reyſe vp theſe men of warre

and kepe the coūtreys of Berrey / Auuergne / 
and Lymoſyn in doute / and kepe the feldes / 
for we ſhall lande in Rocelloyes / and ſhall
make there ſuche warre / that it ſhalbe herde
of and well knowen. The Breton ſayde he
ſhulde do his meſſage / if he hadde no great
lette by the waye. He was ſet a lande on the
ſandes / and (as he that knewe all the countrey
of Bretayne) went of from all the great
townes / and paſſed by the countrey of Poyctou
and entred in to Lymoſyn / and ſo came
to Chalucet / wherof Perot le Bernoys was
capitayne. The meſſangere came to the barryers / 
and gaue knowledge of his cōmynge
to them of the garyſon. After he had ben examyned
at the gate he was lette in / and ſo brought
before Perotte / and dyde well his meſſage / 
wherof Perot had great ioye / For he
greatly deſyred to here tidynges of the army
on the ſee. Than he ſayd to the Breton / thou
arte welcome: Bothe I and all my companions
haue great deſyre to ryde forthe abrode / 
and ſo ſhall we do / and accomplyſſhe that
thou haſt ſhewed vs.
            
               THus Perotte le Bernoys made

all theſe to make thē redy / for he wolde
ryde oute abrode / for he ſawe it than a good
ſeaſon for them. cōmaundynge them to leaue
ſure men in their gariſons tyll their returne.
Theſe companyons who hadde as great deſyre
to ryde abrode as Perot (for they coulde
nat ware ryche withoute ſome other loſte)
made thē redy and came to Chalucet / where
they aſſembled. They were well to the nombre
of foure hundred ſpeares / they thought
themſelfe ſuffycient to do a great feate. they
knewe no lorde in the countrey as than able
to reſyſte them / nor to breke their enterprice.
for the ſiege of Vandachore of ſir Wyllyam
of Lignacke nor of Boeſme Laūce / was nat
defeated as than. Thus they rode forthe and
were lordes of the feldes and paſſed Auuergne
on the ryght hande / and tooke the ryght
waye to Berrey: for they knewe well ye duke
was nat as than there / but was in Fraunce
with the kyng at Moūtereau or faulte you.
¶Nowe lette vs leaue to ſpeke of Perot le
Bernoys and of his enterprice / and ſpeke of
the erle of Arundell and of his armye on the

was departed fro the coſt of Bretayne.
            
               WHan the erle of Arundell & ſuche
lordes as were with hym were
departed fro the coſt of Bretayne / 
they ſayled with good wynd
and wether / for ye tyme was fayre
& pleaſunt / and goodly to beholde ye ſhippes
on ye ſee. They were a ſixſcore one and other / 
with baners and ſtremers wauynge in
the wynde / glytrynge with the lordes armes
agaynſt the ſonne. Thus they went ſaylyng
by the ſee freſſhly (like a horſe newe cōmyng
out of the ſtable brayeng and cryeng / and fomyng
at the mouth) The ſee was ſo prompt
and ſo agreable to thē / as thoughe by fygure
the ſee ſhulde haue ſaid to them. be mery ſirs
I am for you / and I ſhall bring you to good
porte and hauen without peryll. Thus theſe
lordꝭ ſayled frontyng Poyctou and Xaynton
& caſt ancre before Rochell / in ye hauen towarde
Marant. Than ſome of their cōpany ſeyng
the fludde cōmyng / entred or it were full
water in to bottes mo than two hundred one
and other / and arryued nere to the towne of
Marant. The watche of Marant had ſpied
the Englyſſhe flete / and ſawe howe the bottes
were commyng to lande warde with the
fludde. Than he blewe his trūpe and made
great noyſe / to awake the men of the towne
to ſaue them ſelfe / ſo that many men and women
toke their goodes and wente and ſaued
them in the Caſtell / the whiche came well to
paſſe for them / or els they had loſt all. Whan
they ſawe the Englyſſhmen come at their he
lys / they toke that they had and lefte the reſt / 
and ſaued their bodyes. The Englyſſhe archers
and other entred in to the towne / & fell
to pyllage (therfore they came thyder) but lytell
they founde there / ſauyng coffers voyde
and emptye / all their goodes was withdrawen
in to the Caſtell. As for Corne / wyne / 
ſalte becone / and other prouiſion they foūde
ynoughe / for there was more than four hundred

tonne of wyne in the towne. Wherfore
they determyned to abyde there a certayne
ſpace to kepe that prouiſyon. It came well to
paſſe for them / for they ſayde if they ſhulde
departe thens / all ſhulde be withdrawen in
to the fortreſſes / and caryed awaye by the ryuer
to Fountney / as moche as they myght / 
and the reſte diſtroyed. They taryed all that
night in the towne. They came thyder in the
euenyng / and ſente worde to them on the ſee
what caſe they were in / and the cauſe why
they taryed. The erle of Arundell and the other
lordes ſayde / howe they had done well.
This nyght paſſed. The nexte mornynge
whan the tyde began to retourne / they diſancred
all their ſmall veſſelles / and euery man
wente in to them / and putte all their harneſſe
in to bottes and barges / and lafte their great
ſhippes ſtyll at ancre / for they coude nat cum
nere to the lande for lacke of water. and they
laſte an hundred men of armes and two hundred
archers ſtyll there to kepe their ſhippes
whiche laye at the mouthe of the hauyn. thā
with their ſmalle veſſelles they arryued at
Marant / and toke lande at their leyſar / and
ſo lodged all bytwene Marant and ye towne
of Rochell / the whiche was but four leages
fro thens. Tidynges ſpredde abrode in the
countrey / howe the Englyſſhe men were arryued
at Barante / a four hundred fightyng
men: the playne countrey / the good townes
and caſtelles were a ſrayde and made good
watche. Than they of the vyllages fledde amaye / 
and caryed their goodꝭ in to Foreſtes
and in to other places / as ſhortely as they
myght.

were ſore afrayed of the Englyſſhmen
that were a lande / & how
they of Rochell made a ſerimyſſhe

had pylled the countrey
about Marant / they drewe agayne
to the ſee with their pyllage whiche
was great. Cap. C.xxxiiii.
            
               IF the Englyſſhmen
had ben furnyſſhed with
horſes it had been greatly
to their profyte / for ye countrey
as than was vnpro
                  ••
               
               ded
of men of warr / namely
of ſuche as were able to
haue merre with them. True it was / the lord
of Parteney / the lorde of Pons / the lorde of
Lymers / yt lorde of Tanyboton / ſir Geffray
of Argenton / the lorde of Montendre / ſir Aymery
of Roch chouart / the vycont of to wars / 
and dyuers other knyghtes and ſquyers of
Poictou and of Xaynton / were as than in the
countrey: but they were nat toguyder / for euery
man was in his owne fortreſſe / for they
were nat ware of the Englyſſhe mens commynge
thyder. If they hadde knowen a moneth
before that the Englyſſhe menne wolde
haue ryued there / they wolde haue prouyded
therfore / but they knewe it nat. This fell ſodaynly / 
wherfore they were the more afrayde
and euery man toke hede to kepe his owne / &
the men of the countrey to gette in their cornes / 
for it was about the begynnynge of Auguſte.
Alſo there was no heed Capitaygne
in the countrey to bringe menne toguyder.
The duke of Berrey who was cheife ſoueraygne
of Poittou / was but newely gone to
Parys. The ſeneſchall of Xaynton was nat
in the countrey: And the Seneſchall of Rochell
ſir Helyon of Lignacke was nat at Rochell / 
nor in the countrey / He was in great
buſyneſſe to ryde in and out bytwene ye duke
of Berrey and the duke of Lancaſtre. By
theſe reaſons the countrey was the more feble / 
for where there is defaulte of good heedes / 
there muſt nedes be defaulte in the body
and in the fote: And he that hath no foote can
do nothynge that is worthe. Thus theſe lordes
were in feare two wayes. They had the
Englyſſhmen armed before them that came
fro the ſee: And on the other ſyde they herde
newes fro Berrey and fro Limoſyn / that Perot
le Bernoys rode abrode with fyue or ſixe
hundred fyghtynge men with hym / and was
entred in to Berrey. So they wyſt nat wher
to they ſhulde take hede / but euery manne to
kepe his owne. For the renome wente / howe
theſe two hooſtes ſhulde mete toguyder / outher
in the countrey of Poictou or Xaynton.
This was the opinyon of dyuers.
            
               
               TRue it was / that in the towne of
Rochell / the ſame ſeaſon that the
Englyſſhe men were landed at
Marant there was two valyāt
knyghtes / the one called ſir Peter
of Iouy / and the other ſir Taylle Pie / 
whome ſir Helyon of Lignacke had lefte at
Rochell to kepe the towne and countre therabout.
Whan tidynges came to Rochell how
the erle of Arundell and the armye that had
ben ſo longe on the ſee were a lande and lodged
beſyde Marant. Than theſe two knightes
ſayd to thē that were vnder their charge
(and to the mayre of Rochell and men of the
towne) ſirs it muſt behoue vs to go and loke
on theſe Englyſſhe menne. It is ſhewed vs
howe they be arryued in theſe parties. I and
my companion wyll go and gyue them there
welcome / for the whiche they ſhall paye vs / 
or els we them: For we ſhalbe blamed if we
ſuffre them to reſt in peace / ſythe we haue the
charge of the kepynge of this countre. there
is one poynte good for vs / they haue no horſes:
They are men of the ſee / and we be well
mounted: We ſhall ſende our croſbowes be
fore / they ſhall wake them / and ſhote & hurte
them / and whan they haue done they ſhall retourne.
Than the Englyſſhe men wyll iſſue
out after them a fote / and we ſhall ſuffre our
croſbowes to paſſe homwarde / and than we
ſhall receyue our enemyes at the ſpere poynt
We ſhall haue of them ſuche aduaūtage / that
we ſhall do them great domage. Euery man
that herde theſe knyghtes ſpeke / reputed thē
for noble valyaunt men / and agreed to their
counſayle: And there aſſembled toguyder / 
what one and other a twelue hundred. The
nexte mornynge at the breakyng of the daye / 
euery mā was redy & aſſembled togider. and
the croſbowes and men a fote iſſued out and
went a great pace to reyſe the Englyſſhmen
out of their lodgynges. and in the meane ſeaſon
the horſmen made them redy vpon a .iii.
hūdred / for there were dyuers knyghtes and
ſquyers cōe to Rochell. Certainly / if by any
maner inſpyracion thenglyſſhmen had knowen
of their cōmynge / that they might haue
made an embuſſhe (but of two hundred archers
and a hūdred men of armes) there had
nat one Frenchman retourned agayne. Whā
they of Rochell came to the Englyſſhe mens
lodgynges / it was carely in the morenynge / 
and their watche was retourned to their lodgynges.
Than the Frenche croſbowes began
to ſhote and entred in among their lodgynges / 
and hurte many. The Englyſſhe
men lyeng on the ſtrawe had marueyle of the
noyſe / & many were hurte or they knewe that
they were Frenche men. And whan the croſbowes
had ſhotte euery man a ſixe ſhottes / 
or there about / they retourned (as it was before
apoynted). Than aproched the horſmen
and entred among the lodgynges / therwith
the hooſt began to ſtyrre / and knyghtes and
ſquyers drewe toguyder in to the felde. And
whan the Frenche men ſawe the hooſt ſtyrre
and drawe toguyder / they drewe backe and
retourned towarde Rochell a good pace / for
feare of the ſhotte of Englyſſhe men / who folowed
them nere to Rochell. Than the Erle
of Arundell with foure hundred men of armes
folowed after a great pace / euery man
his ſpeare in his hande or on his necke. The
preace of the Frenche fotemen was great at
the entrynge in to Rochell / and alwayes the
two Frenche knyghtes were behynde / & ſette
their men forwarde tyll they were within the
barriers: and euer the Englyſſhe men folowed / 
in ſuche wyſe / that ye two Frēche knightes
were in great daūger to be taken or ſlayn
They were ſore ſette at / bycauſe they ſemed
to be the chiefe capitaynes (as they were in
dede) ſo that ſir Peter Iouy hadde his horſe
ſlayne vnder hym / and with great payne his
men ſaued hym / and drewe hym within the
barryers. And ſir Peter Taylle Pye was
ſtryken through the thye with a glayue / and
with an arrowe throughe ye baſſenet in to the
heed / and his horſe fell downe deed within ye
gate. At the entrynge in to the towne there
were many ſlayne and hurte / mo than .xl. the
men of the towne were aboue ouer the gate
and caſte downe ſtones and ſhotte out bombardes / 
ſo that the Englyſſhe men durſte aproche
no nerer.
            Thus wente the firſt ſcrimyſſhe bytwene
them of Rochell and the Englyſſhe men / and
whan they hadde ſcrimyſſhed nere to noone / 
The erle of Arundell ſowned the retrayte:
Than they withdrewe in good order / and retourned
to their lodgynges & vnarmed them
and toke their eaſe / & they had well wherof.
they lacked nouther wyne nor fleſſhe. The
Englyſſhe men taryed there about a fyftene

dayes / abydinge all aduentures. But after
that / they of Rochell iſſued no more oute to
ſcrmyſſhe / for they ſawe well the Engliſſhe
men were wiſe and valyaunt / and alſo ye two
capitayns were hurt / wherfore the other had
good cauſe to ſytte ſtyll in reſt. The Erle of
Arundell ſent a thre or four tymes abrode in
to the countrey of Rochelloys towarde Breſmure / 
and in to the lande of Towars / and
dyde great dōmage / wherof all the countrey
was a frayde. The Englyſſhmen had done
a great enterprice if they had ben furnyſſhed
with horſmen / & in the countre they gatte but
ſewe: for as ſoone as they herde of their landynge / 
euery man caryed all that they hadde
in to the fortreſſes. And whan this army had
taryed there a fyftene dayes / and were well
refreſſhed / & ſawe that no man came againſt
them and parceyued the wynde good for thē / 
they drewe them in to their ſhippes / and caryed
with them moche wyne & freſſhe fleſſhe
and ſo entred in to their veſſelles / and drewe
vp their ſayles and toke the ſee: and the ſame
daye they mette with .xii. ſhippes of Bayon
goynge in to Englande / charged with wynes
and other marchaūdiſes: ſo they ioyned
toguyder and made good chere. They gaue
to the erle of Arundell two peces of Gaſcoyn
wyne. Thus they ſayled forthe at aduēture.

and his route / to the

marchauntes that were in the towne of Blake
in Berrey / on the whiche daye there was
a great fayre / wherby they had great profite

and came to Selles in Berrey / and pylled
and robbed the towne. Thus Perot and his
companyons rode abrode in the countre and
dyde great dōmage / for there was none that

They coude nat ymagin what theſe two armyes

towne of Graue / with a great puyſſaunce of
knyghtes and ſquyers / and other men of the
good townes of Brabante: and their entencion
was nat to departe thens / tyll they had

the towne of Graue at their wyll. And the ducheſſe
to ſhewe yt the mater touched her nere
the laye at 
                  〈◊〉
                a four leages thens. The
hooſt was plentifull of euery thynge. They
were often tymes refreſſhed with newe prouiſyon
cōmyng fro dyuers partes / aſwell by
ſee by freſſhe water & by the ryuer of Muſe
as by the lande of Brabant. This ſiege long
endured and they had there great ingyns be
ſore the towne to caſte in great ſtones / whiche
dyde great domage. And beſyde that to
enfecte the people within / they caſte in to the
towne all deed careyne: and the wether was
hote / the whiche greatly anoyed them within.
The clere ayre was ſore corrupted with
the yuell ayre. Somtyme the knyghtes and
ſquyers of Brabant wolde come to the barryers
and ſcrimyſſhe with them of ye towne / 
and there were many feates of armes done / 
For there were men in the towne (ſette there
by the duke of Guerles) that were redye to
ſhewe forthe their prowes whan tyme was.
The duke of Guerles lay at Nimay & coude
nat remedy the mater nor reyſe the ſiege / nor
yet fight with his enemyes / for he had no puiſſaunce
therto / But he hadde ſente in to Englande
certifyeng what caſe he ſtode in / truſtynge
to haue had ſocours fro thens / but he
had none / For at that tyme there was moche
trouble in Englande. For there was ſette a
newe counſayle about the kynge by the meanes
of his vncles and tharchbyſſhop of Caū
               terbury
About the feeſt of ſaynt Iohan the
Baptyſt there was a coūſayle in Englande
to knowe if there ſhulde be ſente any ayde of
men of armes & archers to the duke of Guerles
or nat: But euery thyng conſydred / they
thought it beſt naye. For renome ran in Englande
howe the Frenche kyng made a gret
aſſemble but no manne knewe whyther they
ſhulde drawe. The Englyſſhe men by ymaginacyon
douted that they wolde cōe to Ca
               
                  •••
               s:
On the otherſyde they douted the ſcottes
wherfore they wolde nat ſende their men
of armes and archers out of the realme. Alſo
they knewe howe there were many menne of
warre on the ſee wherfore it was cōuenyent
to kepe their owne realme / Therfore the noble
men of Englande ſayd: Lette the duke of
Guerles alone he is ryght valyant and is ī a
ſtronge countre he wyll do well ynoughe agaynſt
the brabanſoys. Alſo he ſhalbe conforted
by ye almayns if nede be / for they be alyed
with hym and his neyghbours. They haue
bene with hym or this agaynſt the Frenche
men. Thus the maters wente in Englande / 
but they within the towne of Graue endured
the payne / with ſautes and ſore ſcrimiſſhing
They of Brabante deuyſed whyle they laye
at the ſiege / to make a bridge of tymbre ouer
the ryuer of Meuſe / therby to entre in to the
duchy of Guerles: And to ouer ronne the coū
               trey / 
and to kepe that no vitayle ſhulde come
to the towne of Graue. And therby to beſege
it bothe before and behynde / and on all partes / 
to kepe it fro vitayling / for they had men
ynowe ſo to do. They ſette many carpentars
a worke with all dilygence / and they dyde ſo
moche that their worke was ſo forwarde / yt
the bridge was nere ouer the water within a
ſpeares caſt. The duke of Guerles had perfite
knowledge of the makyng of this bridge
and dyde lette them alone tyll it was nyghe
made. But whan he ſawe it was nerehande
fyniſſhed / than he came before it with gonnes
and other artillarye: And ſhotte fyre to
the bridge / in ſuche wiſe / that the bridge was
brente and broken / and the brabanſoys loſte
all their labour / wherwith they were ſore diſpleaſed / 
and than toke counſayle what was
beſt for them to do.

            ¶Howe the brabanſoys paſſed the
ryuer throughe the towne of Raueſten / 
ouer the bridge there / and ſo entred
in to Guerles. Than the duke
departed fro Nimay with thre hundred
ſpeares / and came agaynſt thē
and diſconfyted them bytwene Raueſten
and the towne of Graue.
Cap C.xxxvi.
            
               A Thre lytell leages fro ye towne
of Graue is the caſtell of Raueſten / 
parteyninge to the lorde of
Bourne / who was ſubiecte and
helde of the duchy of Brabant.
He was deſyred by the ducheſſe counſayle &
by other lordes and knyghtes / that he ſhulde
open the towne of Raueſten / and ſuffre their

hoſte to paſſe throughe / to entre in to the countrey
of Guerles / And at their deſyres he was
content. The duke of Guerles lyenge at Nymay
was ſurely infourmed (by ſuche ſpyall as
he had) howe the lorde of Bourne wolde gyue
his enemyes fre paſſage to entre into his countrey / 
through the towne of Raueſten / wherof
he was penſyue and malēcolyous / for he ſawe
well he had nat men ynowe to reſyſte the puyſaunce
of Brabante / for they were well a .xl.
thouſande menne one and other. On this the
duke had many ymagynacions. And fynally
all thynges conſydred / he determyned in his
mynde to aſſemble all his men toguyder and
to take the feldes / and to come towardes the
towne of Graue / to the entente that if they of
Brabant entred in to Guerles / than he wolde
entre in to Brabant. For he thought ſurely nat
to be incloſed within the walles of any towne.
Than the duke ſpake to the lorde of Gheſime / 
a great baron of Guerles / who was his princypall
counſaylour / and ſhewed hym his ſayd
mynde and entente. And fyrſte this lorde was
nat of the opynyon that the duke ſhulde take
the feldes with ſo ſmall a nombre. Well quod
the duke / and what ſhall I do than? Shall I
ſuffre my ſelfe to be incloſed in one of my townes?
and in the meane tyme they ſhall brynne
and exyle my countrey. That ſhulde be ouer
dere to me to abyde. I make a vowe to godde
and to our lady quod the duke / I wyll drawe
in to the feldes / and reſyſt my domage as nere
as I may. And as he ordeyned ſo he dyd. The
next mornyng he departed fro Nymay (after
he had ben at churche / and made his offrynge
to our lady of Nymay) Than he and his men
dranke a lytell / and ſo mounted on their horſes.
He was a thre hūdred ſpeares / rather leſſe
than mo / and tooke the feldes / and drewe towardes
their enemyes the next way. Beholde
what a great corage this duke was of. Some
ſayd it was a great outrage. Howbeit he lyke
a coragyous knyght full of comeforte ſayde.
On on forwarde in the name of god and ſaynt
George agaynſte our enemyes / for I had rather
dye in the felde with honoure / than with
dyſhonour to be cloſed within a towne. With
hym was the lorde of Gheſime / a valyant and
a ſage knyght / chyefe ruler of his armye / and
the lorde of Hauſeberth / the lorde of Huckelin
ſir Oſtez lorde of Vaſpre / & dyuers other good
knyghtes and ſquyers of valyaunt corage.
            THe ſame daye that the duke of Guerles
was in the feldes early in the mornyng / 
the ſeneſchall of Brabant with his men
knyghtes / ſquyers / and men of the good townes
in Brabant / by the conſente of the lorde of
Bourne / paſſed the ryuer by the bridge of Raueſten / 
to the nombre of ten thouſande men.
The ſeneſchall of Brabante / the lorde of Lygnier / 
the lorde of Bourguenall / the lorde of
Gence and other / were ryght ioyfull whanne
they ſawe they were ouer the ryuer of Meuſe.
They ſaid than amonge themſelfe / howe they
wolde go the ſame day and make a courſe before
Nymay / and burne the mylles and fawbours
and the villages there about. but ſoone
after that they herde other tydynges by their
fore ryders / ſuche as they had ſent to diſcouer
the countrey. Than tydinges alſo came to the
duke of Guerles / howe a ten thouſande of his
enemyes were paſſed the ryuer of Meuſe / at
the bridge of Raueſten. Than the duke ſtode
in a ſtaye / and toke counſayle what was beſte
to do. Some were ſore abaſſhed bycauſe they
were but a handefull of men to the regarde of
their enemyes / who were thurty or .xl. againſt
one. Some ſayde / howe myght endure thre
hundred ſpeares agaynſte ten or twelue thouſande
men. It lyeth nat in our puyſſaunce to
ouercome them. But it lyeth well in their power
ſoone to ouercome vs. Some knyghtes
came to the duke / and coūſayled him to drawe
towardes Graue. Thanne the duke ſayde he
wolde nat / for in no wyſe he wolde be cloſed in
any towne that he hadde / but ſayde ſurely he
wolde go and fyght with his enemyes / for his
corage he ſayd gaue hym to dyſcomfyte them.
and ſaid as he dyd before / that rather he wold
dye with honour / than to lyue with ſhame. We
ſhall quod he this day ouercome our enemies / 
Wherby we ſhall haue greate profyte and honoure.
Therfore all that loue me / ſet forwarde
and folowe me quyckly.
            THe wordes that the duke ſpake incoraged
all his men / and ſpecyally ſuche as
herde hym / and euery man ſhewed ſemblante
to be of great corage to fight. euery man made
hym redy and laſed on his baſnet / and gyrte
their horſes / and ſet them ſelfe in good aray togyther / 
and rode forthe an eaſy paſſe to kepe
their horſes well brethed. there were certayne
newe knightes made. Thus they rod in good

araye towardes Raueſten. By that tyme the
brabanſoys were ouer the ryuer. Thanne tydynges
came to the Seneſchall of Brabante / 
how the duke of Guerles was in the felde / and
ſo nere them that incontynent they ſhuld mete
togyder. Suche as herde thoſe tydinges firſt
had meruayle of that aduēture. Than they beleued
ſurely that for euery man that the duke
of Guerles had / that he had been ſyre. Than
they reſted to ſette them ſelfe in ordre / but they
had no leyſar. For ther with came on them the
duke of Guerles with his route cloſe togyder / 
as faſte as ſpurres wolde dryue their horſes / 
cryenge their cryes / our lady of Guerles / with
their ſpeares in the reſtes. There was a ſquier
of Guerles greatly to be prayſed / for the great
deſyre that he had to exalte his renome. he galoped
before all the batayls / and was the firſte
that iuſted / and entred in amōge his enemies.
the ſquier was called Arnolde Morber. With
that courſe he bare one to the erthe rudely / I
canne nat tell if euer he was releued or nat / for
the preaſe was ſo greate / that harde it was / if
one were downe to be releued agayn / without
it were by great helpe. At this firſt rencountre
there were of the brabanſoys a ſire ſcore borne
to the erthe. There were many beaten downe / 
and ſmall defence made by the Brabanſoys / 
for they were ſodenly taken. and ſo ſhulde men
of warre do / that thinke to do domage to their
enemyes. For the brabanſoys for all that they
were ſo greate a nombre / and ſo many great
men / yet they were ſo farre a ſonder / and out of
araye / that they coulde nat gette togyther in
ordre of batayle / but their batayle was pearſed
throughe and ſparkled a brode / ſome here
and ſome there / ſo that the lordes of Brabante
coulde nat come to their owne men / nor their
menne to theym. And ſuche as were behynde / 
whanne they herde the noyſe and brewte / and
ſawe ye duſt and powder ryſe / it ſemed to them
properly that the voyce of the dyſcomfetture
came on theym / and howe all their company
were ouercome. So that the feare therof cauſed
them to tourne and to flye towardes Raueſten
agayne / and ſome toke the ryuer at aduenture
bothe a foote and a horſebacke / without
ſerrchyng of the depeneſſe / or without hauynge
of any guyde. And as they fledde they
thought euer their enemyes had been at their
backes. By this dyſcomfettynge of them ſelfe
there were drowned and in parell / moo than
twelue hundred in the ryuer of Meuſe / for they
lepte in one vpon a nother lyke beeſtes / without
ordre or reaſon And ſome of the great lordes
and barones of Brabante / whome I wyll
nat name / for it ſhulde be blame to them and to
their heyres / to be noted to flye away ſo ſhame
fully / and to ſeke for their ſauegarde nother
the right paſſage of the ryuer / nor yet the hygh
way to the towne of Raueſten / but rather other
ſtraunge wayes to flye fro their enemyes. In
this myſchyefe fell that daye the chyualrye of
Brabante / bytwene the towne of Graue and
Raueſten many were ſlayne and taken / For
ſuche as came to raunſome yelded lightly / and
the almayns were gladde to take them / for the
profyte that they thought to haue by theym.
And ſuche as retourned to the lodgynges before
Graue abaſſhed them that were there lyenge
at the ſyege / for they came lyke men clene
diſcomfyted. They came flyenge ſo faſte that
they lacked brethe / ſo that they coulde ſkante
ſpeke any worde (that they ſayd / was) Syrs
gette vs all hence for we be all dyſcomfyted / 
there is no comeforte. Whan they in the hooſt
vnderſtode the trouthe of the mater / and ſawe
their company in that caſe / they were than ſo a
baſſhed & a frayed / that they had no leyſar nor
puyſſaunce to take their owne goodes / nor to
take downe their tentes nor pauylyons / nor to
truſſe horſe / carte / nor wagon / but ſodaynely
departed without byddynge adewe / and lefte
all behynde. They were ſo a frayde that they
made no countenaunce of a bydynge. They
toke with theym nother vytayle nor caryage / 
but ſuche as hadde horſes lepte on them / and
fledde a waye towardes the dukes wodde / or
els towardes Hondan / or to the mount ſaynte
Geruays / or to Gertras / and Dordec. They
had none other care but to ſaue them ſelfe fro
their enemyes. And if they within the garyſon
of Graue had ſoner knowen of the dyſcomfetture / 
it had been greatly for their profyte / and
had ſlayne or taken many of their enemyes in
their flyenge / but they knewe it nat tyll it was
late / howbeit whan they iſſued out they foūde
great plentye of Tentes and pauylyons / and
prouyſion of engyns / gonnes / and artyllery / 
which they brought in to their towne at good
leyſar / for there were none to ſaye them naye.
Thus brake vp the ſiege of Graue to the gret
domage of all the brabanſoys / wherof great
brute ranne in dyuers countreys / howe that a

handefull of men dyſcomfyted .xl. thouſande / 
and reyſed the ſiege. there was taken the lorde
of Bourguenall / and the lorde of Linyer / and
other to the nombre of ſeuentene baners / they
were hanged before the ymage of our lady of
Nymay / for a perpetuall memory.

            ¶Howe the duke of Guerles after
he had dyſcomfyted the brabanſoys
he wente agayne to Nymaye. And
howe tydynges came to the frenche
kynge / and howe the kyng ſente ambaſſadours
to the kyng of Almayne.
Cap. C.xxxvii.
            
               I Haue great payne to
recorde or to wryte of this
ſhamefull dyſcomfyture of
the brabanſoys / for blemyſſhynge
of their honoures.
but bycauſe I promyſed / 
and ſaid in the begynnyng
of my boke / that if I ſhall write truely this hyſtory / 
I muſt make true relacion of the mater / 
who ſo euer it do touche. Nowe to procede further / 
the yonge duke of Guetles had and optaygned
this iourney / in the yere of our lorde
god a thouſande / thre hundred / fourſcore and
eyght / aboute Mawdlyn tyde / in the moneth
of Iuly. And whanne this dyſcomfyture and
chaſe was paſſed / and the felde clene delyuered
(whiche was done within the ſpace of two
houres) Than the guerloys aſſembled togyder
in the felde / and mad good chere and were
ioyfull. They had good cauſe ſo to be / for their
good aduenture / for they had as many pryſoners
or mo / than they were themſelfe in nombre.
Than their haraudes ſought out the deed
bodyes of bothe partyes / and amonge other
there was ſlayne a yonge man / ſonne to therle
of Namure / called Vaſſyer of Colles / lorde of
Balaſter / of whoſe dethe the duke of Gnerles
was ſory and ſore dyſpleaſed / and that he ſhewed
well / for greatly he complayned his deth / 
and ſayde / howe the dethe of a yonge knyght
dyſpleaſed hym greatly / for he was a ryght
luſty knyght / pleaſaunte and ioly / and alſo the
yere before he had ben in Pruſe with the duke
of Guerles. Some counſayled the duke to retourne
to the towne of Graue / and there to refreſſhe
theym / and to brynge thyder their priſoners.
Naye nat ſo quod the duke / for army
departynge fro Nymay I auowed to our lady
there that if I ſpedde well / to returne thyder
to offre to our lady / wherfore I wyll with
a mery chere that we all retourne thyder / and
thanke our lady / who hath ſent vs the vyctory
of our enemyes. No man durſte ſaye naye agaynſt
the dukes mynde. And ſo they rode thyder
a good paſe / it was but two good leages
fro thence as the batayle was / anone they came
thyder. Whan tydynges came to Nymay of
the trouthe of that buſynes / men / women / and
children were ioyfull / and the clergy iſſued out
and receyued the duke with great ioy. and the
duke of Guerles incontynent with his knyghtes
wente to the churche / where the ymage of
our lady was / in whome the duke had great
affyaunce / and there in the chapell he was vnarmed
of all his peces in to his doublet / and
gaue all his armure to the churche / in the honour
of our bleſſed lady / thankynge her of the
iourney that he hadde atchyued. And there all
the penons of the lordes that were taken that
day were hanged vp before our lady. I canne
nat tell if they be there as yet or nat. Than the
duke went to his lodgynge / and ſo dyd euery
manne with their priſoners / for they thought
ſurely they ſhulde well paye for their ſcot / therfore
they made good chere.
            GReat brute ſpred abrode of this duke of
Guerles / who had thus ouer throwen
the brabanſoys / wherby he was more douted
than he was before. The duches of Brabante
(who laye at the dukes wood with her trayne)
whan ſhe ſawe howe yuell the mater wente agaynſt
her / and that the ſyege of Graue was
rayſed / ſhe was ſore diſpleſed and good cauſe
why / for it touched her nere. Than ſhe ſette a
garyſone at the dukes wood / to kepe fronter
there / and ſo retourned through Champayne
and came to Bruſelles / and wrote often tymes
to the duke of Burgoyne / aduertyſynge hym
of her a ſtate / for all her hope of recoueraunce
was in hym. ye may well knowe and byleue
that this diſcomfyture of the brabanſoys was
ſoone knowen in the french kinges courte / but

they made lytell accōpte therof / ſyth they ſawe
the kynge had ſuche affection to go to Guerles.
The kynges counſayle wrote to ſyr Wyllyam
of Tremoyle and to ſir Geruais of Myrande / 
who were ſoueraygne capytays of the
men of warre that the duke of Burgoyne had
ſente in to the countrey / and to the kepers of
the thre caſtels on the ryuer of Meuſe / Buth / 
Gaulgeth / and Nulle. Commaundyng them
to kepe well their fronters and nat to make
any iſſue out wherby to take any domage / tyll
they here more / ſhewynge theym ſurely howe
the kynge in pr
                  •
               pre perſone ſhortly wolde go
ſe the duke of Guerles in his owne countrey.
This ſir Willyam was ſore dyſpleaſed of the
aduenture that was fallen on their party. but
the tydynges of Fraunce comforted hym agayne / 
and ordred hym ſelfe acordynge as he
was commaunded.
            NOwe lette vs retourne to the counſayle
of Fraunce who had great deſyre to go
in to Guerles. They toke ſuche dyſpleaſure
with the defyaunce that the duke had ſente to
the kynge / that they nother regarded the begynnynge / 
myddes / nor ende / and ſayd / what
ſo euer it coſte / they wolde make the duke repent
his dede and to denye it / or els they wold
diſtroy and burne his landes and his fathers
alſo / the duke of Iulyers. Dukes / erles / barones
knyghtes ſquyers / and all other were
warned euery man to be redy / acordyng as it
apertayned for ſo longe a voyage. And it was
ordeyned that one of the marſhals of Fraunce
ſhulde abyde ſtyll in the realme / that was ſyr
Loys of Porteuyr / and he to take hede of the
fronters on the other ſyde of the ryuer of Dordone
to the ſee / for in Languedoc / bytwne the
ryuer of Gyronde / dyſcendynge to the ryuer
of Loyre there was truce had bytwene them.
And it was ordeyned that the other marſhall
ſyr Moton of Blamuyll ſhulde go with the
kyng. It was maruayle to thynke of the great
prouyſyon that the lordes made. Fyrſte for the
kyng / and for the dukes of Berrey / Burgoyn
Tourayne / and Burbon / at the cyties of Reynes / 
Chalous / Troys and in all the coūtreys
of Champayne / Raynes / in the byſſhopprike
of Laon / and Landers. And cartes and caryages
were taken vp in all partyes. It was marueyle
to conſyder the great aparell that was
made for this iourney in to Guerles. All this
ſeaſon the duke of Bretaygne was at Parys / 
and coulde nat be delyuered by the kyng / who
was moſt parte al that ſeaſon of Mouſtreuell
Faulte yon. But alwayes he had good chere / 
and was alwayes ſerued with fayre wordes
and curteyſe / and the lordes wolde deſyre hym
nat to thynke longe / for ſhortly he ſhulde be delyuered / 
but they ſhewed hym that the kynge
had ſo moch a do for his vyage in to Almayne / 
that he coulde attende to nothynge els. The
duke was fayne to ſuffre for he coulde do none
other ſeyng he was at Parys / and he thought
he wolde nat departe without the good wyll
of the kynge. There he laye at great coſte and
charge.
            
               WHan the certayne was knowen of this
voyage in to Guerles / and tayles reyſed
throughe the realme to paye euery
man their wages that ſhulde ſerue the kynge.
Many of the wyſe men of the realme as well
ſome of the counſayle as other / ſayd / howe it
was a great outrage to counſayle the kyng to
go farre of to ſeke for his enemyes / and that he
ſhulde therby put his realme in a great aduenture / 
for the kynge was yonge / and greatly in
the fauoure of all his people. Wherfore it had
ben ſuffycyente for hym to haue ſuffred one or
two of his vncles to haue gone thyder with the
conſtable of Fraunce / and a ſixe or ſeuen thouſande
ſpeares / and nat the kyng in propre perſone.
The kynges vncles were of the ſame oppynyon / 
and often tymes they counſayled the
kynge to forbeare his iourney him ſelfe. But
whan ſo euer they ſpake to hym therof he was
dyſpleaſed / and wolde ſaye. If any of you go
without my company / it ſhall be agaynſt my
wyll / and beſyde that ye ſhall haue no money / 
otherwyſe I can nat reſtrayne you. Whan the
dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne herde the
kynges anſwere / and ſawe the great affection
that the kynge hadde to go that voyage / they
aunſwered and ſayd. Syr / a goddes name ye
ſhall go / and without you we wyll do nothing
therfore ſir be of good comfort. Than the kynges
counſayle regarded one thyng the whiche
they thought ryght neceſſary (and that was
this) Bytwene the frenche kynge & the kynge
of Almayne of longe tyme there had ben ordynaunces
made bytwene them / and that was / 
that none of them ſhulde entre with any army
in to any of their neyghbours landes / nor the

frenche kynge to make no warre agaynſt the
kynge of Almayne / nor he agaynſt the kynge / 
on payne to ryn in the ſentence of holy church.
and therto they were bounde and ſolempely
ſworne the day of their coronacyon / to the entente
to kepe their realmes in peace and reſte.
wherfore than it was aduyſed that if the kyng
ſhulde go this voyage in to Guerles (the whiche
is holden of the kynge of Almayne) that
fyrſt he and his counſayle ſhulde ſuffycyently
informe the kyng of Almayne / howe the duke
of Guerles had ſhamefully defyed the frenche
kynge / with fell wordes / out of the ſtyle and
vſage that lordes are wonte to dfye eche other
in warre. and to the entente to cauſe the
duke to denye his dede / and to repente hym / 
The frenche kynge wyll come in to Almayne / 
nat agaynſt the kyng of Almayne nor his ſignory / 
but agaynſt his enemye / and to ſeke him
out where ſo euer he can fynde hym. To go on
this meſſage was charged ſyr Guy of Hancorte / 
a ryght ſage and dyſcrete knyght / and
with hym one of the mayſters of the parlyament / 
called mayſter yues Orient. Theſe two
were called before the counſayle and charged
to go this voyage to the kynge of Almayne / 
and they were well informed what they ſhuld
do and ſay.thus they departed and toke their
waye by Chalous in Champayne / and rode
with a good trayne lyke notable perſons / ambaſſadours
fro the Frenche kynge. And they
founde the lorde of Coucy at Chalous / who
lay there and retayned knyghtes and ſquiers
of Barre / Lorayne / and Champayne / to go
in that voyage with hym in the vowarde. He
made to theſe ambaſſadours good chere / and
made theym a great dyner at their lodgynge / 
and the nexte daye they departed and rode towardes
ſaynte Menehont / and towardes the
coūtrey of Luſenburgh / there to here certayne
tydynges of the kynge of Almayne.
         
         
            ¶How the frenche kyng gaue leaue
to the duke of Bretayne to retourne
in to his coūtrey / and howe the countrey
of Brabant wolde nat conſente
too the kynges paſſage nor his aremy / 
and howe the ambaſſadours of
Fraunce ſped. Ca. C .xxxviii.
            
               WHyle theſe frenche ambaſſadours
wente to ſpeke
with the kyng of Almayne / 
in ye meane tyme the french
men lette nat ſtyll to make
their prouyſions / and commaundement
gyuen / euery
manne to be in the felde by the myddes of Auguſte / 
in Champayne or there aboute / for the
kynge wolde be redy by that tyme they wolde
nat tary for any aunſwere fro the kynge of Almayn.
Than the frenche kyng and his vncles
thought it good that the duke of Bretaygne
ſhulde departe home. He was ſente for to the
kynge / to Monſtreuell faulte you / and there
he had good chere of the kyng and of the duke
of Burgoyne / and of the duke of Tourayne / 
for as than the duke of Berrey was nat there / 
he was in his owne countrey aſſemblyge men
togyder / and had ſente his cōmaundement in
to Poyctou to knyghtes & ſquyers there / that
they ſhulde drawe in to the felde. The kynge
and the duke of Burgoyne treated amyable
the duke of Bretaygne / and ſhewed hym nothyng
but loue. ye haue herde here before how
the duke had rendred agayne to the conſtable
his thre caſtels / and the towne of Iugon / but
as for the hundred thouſande frankes that he
had receyued / he was lothe to rendre them agayne / 
for he axed alowaunce for ſuche prouyſyons
as he had made / and fortifyenge of his
garyſons / caſtels / and townes / and retayning
of men of warre / and kepynge theym all the
wynter / for he thought to haue had warre. but
the kyng and his counſayle fedde hym with ſo
ſwete pleaſaunte wordes / that fynally he was
agreed to pay agayne the hundred thouſande
frankes in fyue yere .xx. thouſande euery yere
tyll it were paied. Than the duke of Bretayne
departed ryght amyably / and the kynge gaue
hym many fayre iouels. And ſo he returned to
Parys / and there the duke of Burgoyn made
hym a great dyner / and there they toke leaue
eche of other. Thanne the duke of Bretaygne
payed for all his dyſpenſes / and toke the waye
to Eſtampes / & rode through Beaulce to Bogency
on ye ryuer of Loyre / and there his men
wente on before and paſſed through the countreys
of Bloys / Mayne / Thourayne / Aniou / 
and entred in to Bretayne / but the duke hym
ſelfe had redy at Boygēcy his nauy / and there
he entred into a fayre ſhyp / and with hym the

lorde Mountforde & the lorde of Maleſtroit / 
and ſo ſayled downe the ryuer of Loyre / and
paſſed vnder the bridge of Bloys / and ſo went
a longe the ryuer to Naūtes in his owne countrey.
¶Nowe let vs leaue to ſpeke of the duke
of Bretayne / and as farre as I coulde here he
helde well the couenaunte made bytwene the
frenche kynge and hym / and dyd nothyng after
to be remembred tyll I cloſed this boke / I
can nat tell what he wyll do herafter / if he do I
ſhall ſpeke therof acordyng as I ſhall knowe.
Nowe I wyll retourne to the frenche kynge / 
who prepared for his iourney in to Guerles.
            Whan ye lorde of Coucy was cōe to the kyng
to Monſtreau / he ſhewed the kyng & his counſayle
howe he had ſped / and howe that all the
knyghtes & ſquyers in Bare / in Lourayne / in
Burgoin / & to the riuers of Ryne and Some
were redy to go with hym. the kyng had therof
gret ioy / & ſayd by the grace of god he wold
the ſame yereſe his coſyns the duke of Iuliers
and Guerles. Fyrſte they determyned whiche
way they ſhulde take / for the ſureſt & way ſhorteſt
(ſome ſayd) yt the ryght way was to go by
Thyreaſhe and to paſſe by the fronter of Haynalt
/ and of Liage / & to paſſe through Brabāt / 
and ſo to entre in to Guerles / and to paſſe the
ryuer of Meuſe at Trecte / and ſo to entre into
the lande of Iuliers and fro thence in to Guerles.
Of this determynacion the kynge and his
counſayle wrote to the duches of Brabant and
to the countrey / ſhewnge them the waye that
the french kynge purpoſed to kepe. It pleaſed
ryght well the duches / but the countrey wolde
nat agre therto but ſayd howe the kynge and
the frēchmen ſhulde haue no paſſage that way
for it ſhulde be greatly to their domage. The
good townes and the knyghtes of Brabante
were of ye opynyon / and ſayd to their lady the
duches / that if ſhe cōſented to ſuffre the frenche
men to entre into her countrey / they wolde neuer
ayde nor ſocoure her agaynſt the duke of
Guerles / but ſurely they ſayd they wolde cloſe
their townes / and go and defende their landes
againſt ye frenchmen / ſayeng howe they ſhuld
leſe more by their paſſinge through their countrey / 
than if their enemies were in the myddes
therof. whan the duches parceyued the wylles
and ententes of the people / aſwell knightes as
other / ſhe ſawe no remedy / but to dyſſymule
the mater. than ſhe charged ſir Iohan Orpen
and ſyr Iohan of Graue / and Nycholas de la
Money / to go in to Fraunce to ſpeke with the
frenche kyng & with the duke of Burgoyn / to
excuſe the countrey of Brabant / that he ſhuld
nat take his voyage that waye / for they of the
countrey thinke they ſhuld be ſore greued and
diſtroyed if he ſhulde paſſe through their countrey / 
and ſhe cōmaunded them to ſaye / that as
for herſelfe ſhe coude be well content therwith / 
and had done all that ſhe coulde that it myght
ſo haue ben. They acordynge to their ladyes
mynde departed fro Bruſels & rode towardes
Parys / and dyd ſo moche by their iourneys
that they came to Mouſtreau fault yon / where
the kynge and his vncles were / and there was
nothynge ſpoken of / but of their goynge in to
Guerles. The ducheſſe ambaſſadours fyrſte
came to ye duke of Burgoyne / and ſhewed him
their letters and their meſſage. And he at the
requeſt of his aunte was meane to the kynge
and to his counſayle / and alſo the lorde of Coucy
dyd what he myght. In ſo moche that their
firſte purpoſe as paſſynge through Brabant
to entre in to Guerles was broken / and the duches
and the countrey excuſed. Than it was
aduyſed that they ſhuld go along the realme / 
whiche way they ſayd was moſte honourable
for the kynge / and alſo for the brabanſoys / burgonyons
ſauoyſyns / and other.
            THan it was cōcluded / and ſuch named
as ſhulde go in vowarde. There were
ordeyned a .xxv. hundred hewers of woodes / 
hedgers & dykers / to make playne the wayes.
The frenche men had way good ynough thorough
the realme tyll they came to Ardayne.
Than their good wayes began to fayle / than
they founde hygh wodes dyuers and ſauage / 
and walles / rockes / & mountaynes. Theſe pyoners
were ſente before the vangarde with a
thouſande ſpeares / to aduyſe the beſt paſſage
for the kyng and for the hooſt / and for their caryage / 
wherof they had a .xii. M. cartes beſyde
other caryages / and they to hewe downe
the hygh wodes of Ardane and to make them
playn / and to make newe wayes where neuer
none was before / nor no man paſſed that way.
Euery man toke great payne to do their dylygence / 
and ſpecyally ſuche as were aboute the
kynge / for they had neuer ſo great affection to
go in to Flaūders / as they had than to go into
Guerles. and the lorde of Coucy was ſent to
A
                  ••
               gnon / to hym that called hym ſelfe pope
Clement / I knowe nat for what cauſe / & the

vicount of Meaulx / ſir Iohan Roy / and the
lorde de la Bone / had the goueruaūce of his
men tyll he retourned agayne.
            Nowe let vs ſomwhat ſpeke of ſir Guy of
Hācourt & of maiſter yues Orient who were
ſent to the kynge of Almayne. They rode ſo
long that they came to Cōualence where the
kyng was. And whan they hadde refreſſhed
thē they went towardes the kyng / who was
enformed of their cōmyng before: and he had
great deſyre to know what entent they came
for. He aſſembled his counſayle / & than theſe
two lordes came before the kyng of Almayn
and curteſſy dyd ſalute hym & delyuerd their
letters of credēce fro the french kyng. ye kyng
toke & reed them / & than regarded thē & ſaid.
ſir Guy / ſhewe forthe your charge / ye knyght
ſpake ryght ſagely & by great leyſar: & ſhewed
the kyng & his coūſaile how the frenche
kyng wt his army royall wyll come in to the
frōters of Almayne / nat to make any warre
agaynſt hym / but agaynſt his enemy ye duke
of Guerles / who had highly defied the kyng
their maiſter with ſhamfull wordes / & out of
the ſtyle of all other defyaūces / ye whiche the
frenche kyng nor his coūſaile can in no wyſe
ſuffre. Wherfore ſir ꝙ they / the kyng requyreth
you / as ye be a noble king & of his blode
and he of yours / as all ye worlde knoweth: yt
ye wyll nat ſuſtayne / ayde nor mentayne the
pride of this duke: but ye to holde ye aliances
and cōfyrmacions ſōtyme done & ſworne bytwene
thempire of Almayne & the realme of
Fraūce ye whiche he wyll fermly kepe on his
ꝑte: Than ye kyng anſwered & ſaid. ſir Guy
we are enformed yt our coſyn the frēche kyng
wyll aſſemble togider great nōbre of people
He neded nat for ſo ſmal a mater to aſſemble
ſuche people / & to ſpende ſo moche to ſeke his
ennemy ſo farr of / for if he had deſired me / wt
leſſe trauayle I coude well haue cauſed ye duke
of Guerles to hame cōe to mercy & reaſon.
ſir ꝙ the knight / we thanke you yt it pleaſeth
you to ſay ſo / but the kyng our maiſter regardeth
but lytell his expenſes nor trauell of his
men / but he regardeth his honour / & to this
his coūſaile is agreed. & ſyth yt you nor your
coūſayle is nat myſcontent with our maiſter
(who wyll in no wyſe violate nor breke ye ordinaūces
& confirmaciōs of olde tyme made
bitwene ye two realmes of Fraūce & almain)
but kepe & mentayne it / on the paynes ye is ordayned / 
therfore ſir we be ſent nowe to you.
Well ꝙ the kyng I beleue you well. & as for
our coſyn ye frenche kyng ſhalbe welcome in
to theſe ꝑtes / as forme I thynke nat to ſtyrre
Ther wt the meſſāgers were ryght ioyous / &
thought they had ſped very well. thā they deſyred
to haue letts agayne / ye kyng ſaid they
ſhulde haue. That day they taryed & dyned
with the kynge & had good chere / & after dyner
they wente to their lodgynges. Wherto
ſhulde I make long ꝓceſſe / they ſped ſo well
that they had letters & ſuche anſwere as pleaſed
thē well. Than they toke leaue of ye kyng
of Almayne / & retourned the ſame way they
came. Nowe let vs ſpeke of the frēche kyng.
         
         
            ¶Howe therle of Bloys ſent to the
frenche kyng .ii. C. ſpeares / & the duke
of Loraine and the lorde Henry of
Bare came to the kyng. And howe
the dukes of Iullyers and Guerles
knewe that the Frenche kyng came
on them. Cap. C .xxxix.
            
               TO accōplyſhe this vyage / euery
lorde in Fraūce aꝑelled thē ſelfe

normādy / aniou / tourayn / & chāpayn / 
and fro all the lymitaciōs of ye realme of Frā
               ce.
Feweſt men came out of fardeſt coūtreis
and ye moſt nōbre out of Burgoyn / picardy / 
bare / & lorayne. & bicauſe they of the body of
Fraūce were in the waye / therfore they were
beſt trauelled. It was ordayned by ye kyng &
his coūſayle / yt no man ſhulde take any thyg
in ye coūtre wtout payeng therfore / to thēcent
that ye pore men ſhulde nat be greued. but for
all yt ordinaūce / ye whiche was well knowen
and ſprede abrode / & vpon payne of great puniſſyon.
yet the men of warre ofte tymes ſore
trauelled ye coūtries as they paſſed through / 
they coude nat abſteyne / for they were but yuell
payde of their wages / and they muſt nedes
lyue. That was their excuſe whan they
were blamed for their pyllage by the conſtable / 
marſhalles / or capitaynes. The erle of

Bloyes was ſente vnto / to ſende two hundred
ſpeares of choſen men / and was promyſed
well to be payde. I can nat ſaye howe he
was dalte with all / but he ſente to ſerue the
kynge two hundred ſpeares / out of the countie
of Bloyes. And capitayns of them was / 
the lorde of Vyenne / ſir Guyllyam of ſaynt
Martyne / ſir Wyllyam of Chaumont / and
the lorde Montigny: theſe foure had the gouernaunce
of the erle of Bloys bande. They
drewe lytell and lytell towardes Chāpayne
thyder they were ordayned to go. Than the
Frenche kynge departed from Mouſtreau
Faulte yon / and tooke the waye to Chalous
in Champayne. As than the duke of Berrey
was nat come / for or his departyng he loked
to here tidynges fro ſir Helyon of Lignacke
whom he had ſente to the duke of Lancaſtre
to Bayon / to haue to his wyfe ye dukes doghter:
as ye haue herde before. But he had her
nat / For the duke of Lancaſtre diſſymuled
with hym / and helde ſtyll the knyght with
hym at Bayon. He treated with two parties
but he rather enclyned to the kynge of Caſtyle
than to the duke of Berrey / and in lyke
wyſe ſo dyde the lady Cuſtaunce his wyfe.
The duke made good chere to bothe parties
to the entent to enflame them the ſoner to the
maryage of his doughter. The kyng of Caſtyls
meſſangers ſore traueyled in treatyng
of this maryage: They reſted nat to ryde in
and out bytwene the parties: They offered
great gyftes to thoſe meſſangers / but they of
fred nothynge to ſir Helyon of Lignacke.
Whan it was knowen in ye realme of Fraūce
that the kyng was at Chalous on his waye
towardes the duchy of Guerles / than euery
man departed fro their houſes and drewe after
the kyng. Than came the duke of Berrey
and lodged at Eſpinay / and the duke of Burbone
at another place / the erle of Marche / ye
erle Dolphyn of Auergne / the erle of ſaynt
Pole / and the erle of Tourayne. And with
the kynge was the duke of Burgoyne / the
duke of Lorayne / the duke of Tourayne / the
conſtable of Fraunce / ſir Guye of Tremoile
ſir Iohan of Beull: And the countrey about
Chalous and Raynes / more than .xii. leages
all about was clene eaten vp with the men of
warre. As than the lorde of Coucy was nat
retourned fro the pope: Than retourned ſir
Wyllyam of Hācourt and mayſter yues Orient / 
and founde the kynge and his vncles at
Chalous. The kyng was ioyouſe of their cō
               myng
and demaunded tidynges. They ſhewed
the kyng what they had founde & done / 
and ſayd howe the kynge of Almaygne had
made them good chere / and ſaid to the kyng.
Sir / whan the kyng had reed the copye of ye
defyaunce that the duke of Guerles had ſent
to you / bothe he and his coūſayle were yuell
cōtent therwith: and ſayd howe it was done
by great preſūpcyon and pride. And we can
parceyue none other / but he and his coūſaile
is well content with your enterprice / and ye
ſhall haue no let by hym: & the kynge is well
content to vpholde and maynteyne the auncient
alyaūces that is bytwene the empyre and
Fraūce: he ſaythe ye ſhall haue no dout ther
of. Herof the Frēche kyng was right ioyfull
howe be it ſome ſayd / that wheder the kynge
of Almayne wolde or nat / the kyng had puiſſaunce
ſuffycient to do what he wolde without
daūger / for all him. than the kyng ordeyned
to departe fro Chalous in Champayn / &
ſo deꝑted & toke his way right to great Pre.
            Whan the kynge came to great Pre he taried
ther a thre dayes / he coude make no gret
iourneys / there was ſo moche people before
hym and behynde / and rounde about hym / ſo
that he was conſtrayned to ryde eaſely to haue
good lodgyng / and bicauſe of the great ꝓuiſyon
that folowed after the hooſt. Fro the
firſt company to the laſt cōtayned .xxiiii. leages
of that countrey / & ſtyll dayly came people.
Therle of great Pre receyued the kynge
in to his towne and countre / and offred all at
the kynges pleaſure. The kyng was well cō
               tent
with hym / & therle was apoynted to the
vantgard. Thyder came to the kyng ye duke
of Lorayne & ſir Henry of Bare / with a faire
company of men of armes. The duke of Loraine
was ordayned to be with his ſonne the
lorde of Coucy / & ſir Henry of Bare to abide
with the kyng. the pioners were ſore beſyed
in the foreſt of Ardane / to cutte downe wode
and to make wayes where neuer non was before.
they had great payne to fyll the valeys
to make the waye playne for the caryage to
paſſe. There were a thre. M. that dyde nothyng
els. Whan ye duches of Brabāt knewe
ſurely howe the kyng was on his waye / and
approched the foreſte of Ardayne / ſhe was

therof ryght ioyfull / for ſhe thought at that
voyage ſhe ſhulde be well reuenged of the
duke of Guerles / & howe the Frenche kyng
ſhulde bring hym to reaſon. And alſo his father
the duke of Iulyers / who had done to
her many anoyaunces: Than ſhe departed
fro Bruſelles / and in her company the erle of
Sammes in Ardain / the lorde of Bocelairs
and dyuers other / and toke her waye to Luſenbourge
to ſe the kynge and to ſpeke with
hym. She paſſed ye ryuer of Meuſe and the
ryuer of Huy / and at laſte came to Baſconque
and there taryed the kynge / for he ſhulde
paſſe therby / and ſo he dyde: For whan he departed
Graunt Pre / he paſſed the Ryuer of
Meuſe at Morſay with all his hooſt / & rode
ſmall iourneys. Than tidynges came in to
the duchy of Iulyers and in to Guerles / that
the Frenche kynge was cōmynge on them / 
with a hundred thouſande men: And that he
had neuer ſo moche people toguyder before.
He was nat ſo great a company whanne he
came to Burboure / where he thought the Englyſſhe
army had ben gretter than he founde
theym. The duke of Iulyers than began to
dout / but the duke of Guerles made nothing
therof / but ſayde. Lette them come / the further
they come the more weryer ſhall they be
and they and their caryages ſhall waxe feble
and their prouiſyons ſhall waſte and wynter
ſhall drawe on / and I am in a ſtronge
countrey. They ſhall nat entre at their eaſe.
They ſhall recule backe ſomtyme otherwiſe
than by the ſowne of the trumpettes / and it
ſhall behoue them to be alwayes toguyder / 
which they can nat be / if they wyll entre in to
my coūtre: And if they diſrought and be out
of ordre / they ſhall ſoone be taken vp wheder
they wyll or nat. Howe be it to ſaye the
trouthe quod the duke / our coſyn of Fraūce
is of a good corage: he ſheweth and dothe as
I ſhulde do. Thus the duke of Guerles deuyſed
amonge his knyghtes / but the duke of
Iulyers was ſore abaſſhed / for he ſawe well
the French kynge wolde his lande were but
brente and loſte. Than he toke counſayle of
his brother the Archebyſſhoppe of Colonge
and of his coſyn the byſſhop. Leage / ſir Arnolde
of Hornes / howe he ſhulde do to ſaue
his lande fro brennyng and exylyng. Theſe
two prelates counſayled hym and ſayd. how
it muſt nedes behoue hym to hūble hym ſelfe
to the Frenche kynge and to his vncles. The
duke ſayde / he was well content ſo to do.

to be holden on the fronter of the wylde ſcottes / 
at a cytie called Berdane / where aſſembled
in maner all the lordes of Scotlande.
At this feeſt they concluded and made full
promyſe / that in the myddes of Auguſt / the
yere of our lorde god / a thouſande thre hundred
fourſcore ano eight / They ſhulde mete
all with their puyſſaunce on the fronters of
Gales / at a caſtell in the hyghe foreſt called
Gedeours. Thus at that tyme they departed
eche fro other. And of this couenaūt there
was none of them that made their kyng priuy
therto / For they ſayd amonge themſelfe / 
their kyng was no manne of warre. There
came to Gedeours at the day apoynted. firſt
the erle Iames Duglas / ſir Iohan of Morette / 
erle of Marche and or Donbare / ſir
Wyllyam de Fu / and ſir Stephyn Erle of
Monſtres / ſir Aucebauce of Duglas / ſir Robert

Here / ſir Wylliam of Waleran / ſir Iohn̄
Amonſtan / and Dauy his ſonne / Robert Colemney / 
and dyuers other knightes and ſquiers
of Scotlande. In threſcore yere before
there was nat aſſembled toguyder in Scotlande
ſuche a nombre of good mē / they were
a .xii. hūdred ſpeares and .xl. thouſande men
beſyde with their archers: but ī tyme of nede
the ſcottes can lytell ſkyll with their bowes.
They rather beare axes / wherwith they gyue
great ſtrokes.
            WHan they were thus mette togyder
in the marcheſſe of Gedeours they
were mery / and ſayd / they wolde neuer
entre againe in to their owne houſes tyll
they had ben in Englande and done ſuche dedes
there / that it ſhulde be ſpoken of .xx. yere
after. And to the entent to make ſure poyntment / 
they aſſigned a daye to mete at a churche
in a fayre laūde called zedon. Tidynges
came in to Northumberlande (as nothynge
can be hydde if men putte to their dilygence
to knowe) bothe to therle and to his chyldrē / 
to the ſeneſchall of yorke / and to ſir Mathue
Redman capitayne of Berwike / of this gret
feeſt that had ben at Bredane. And to thērent
to knowe wherfore it was / theſe lordes ſente
to ſertche couertly by heraudes & mynſtrels.
The ſcottes coude nat do their maters ſo ſecrerly / 
but ye lordes of Englāde knewe howe
men roſe in ſcotlāde / & how they ſhulde mete

agayne at Gedeours. Brute of this came to
Newcaſtell vpontyne: And whan the lordes
knewe of this / euery man toke good hede to
his charge / and prouyded them ſelfe redy to
aſſemble if nede were / and this they dyde ſecretly / 
bycauſe their enterprice ſhulde nat be
broken. Euery man helde hym ſelfe in their
owne houſes / and were determyned to mete
toguyder / as ſoone as they knewe that the
ſcottes came forwarde and ſayd. If the ſcottes
come forthe we ſhall haue knowlege therof / 
If they drawe towardꝭ Carlyle we ſhall
entre at another parte in to their countrey / 
and we ſhall do them more dommage than
they can do vs / for their countrey is all open.
We maye go where we lyſt / and our countre
is ſtrong / and the townes and caſtelles well
cloſed. And the better to knowe the ſtate of
the ſcottes / they ſent a gentylman of Englā
               de / 
who knewe ryght well the marcheſſe of
Scotlande / and ſpecially the foreſt of Gedeours
where ye ſcottes ſhulde aſſemble. And
the Engliſſhe ſquyer went ſo forwarde / that
without eſpyeng he came to the churche of zedon / 
where the ſcottyſſ he lordes were. And
he encred in amonge them lyke one of their
ſeruauntes / and there he herde and knewe a
great parte of thententes of the ſcottes. and
at thende of their counſayle the ſquyer went
to a tree where he hadde tyed his horſe / and
thought to haue foūde him there / but he was
gone. for a ſcotte (who be great theues) had
ſtollen hym awaye. He durſte nat ſpeke for
hym / but ſo went forthe a fote boted and ſpurted.
And whan he was gone fro the churche
two bowe ſhotte / than there were two ſcottyſſ
he knyghtes deuyſed bytwene them ſelfe
and ſayd one to another. felowe / I haue ſene
a marueyle / beholde yonder a man gothe alone / 
and as I thynke he hath loſt his horſe / 
for he came by and ſpake no worde / I wene
he be none of our company / lette vs ryde after
hym to proue my ſayeng. They rode after
hym and ſoone ouertoke hym. Whan̄e he
ſawe them cōmynge / he wolde gladly haue
ben thens. They came to hym and demaunded
whether he wolde and from whens he
came / and what he had done with his horſe.
He began to varry in his ſayeng / and anſwered
nat directely to their purpoſe. They turned
hym / and ſayde he ſhulde go and ſpeke
with their lordes. They brought hym again
to the churche of zedon / and preſented hym
to the erle Duglas and to other lordes: they
examyned hym and parceyued well he was
an Englyſſhe man. Than they ſayde they
wolde knowe the trouthe why he came thyder.
He was yuell wyllynge to ſhewe the
trouthe / but they handled hym in ſuche wiſe / 
that he was fayne to ſhewe all the mater / for
they bare hym in hande / withoute he wolde
ſhewe the trouthe / incōtynent he ſhulde leſe
his heed: and if he wolde ſhewe the trouthe / 
he ſhulde haue none yuell. There they knew
by hym that the lordes of Northumberlande
had ſente hym thyder: to knowe the eſtate of
their ent̄price / and whiche waye they wolde
drawe. Herof the ſcottes were right ioyous / 
and wolde nat for a great good / but that they
had ſpoken with this ſquyer. Than they demaunded
agayne of hym / in what parte the
Englyſſhe lordes were / and whyder there
were any aparence that they wolde aſſemble
toguyder / and what way
                  •
                they wolde take
to entre in to Scotlande: Outher by the ſee
ſyde by Berwyke / or els by Donbare: or els
the highe waye by the countie of Monſtres
towarde Streuelyn. The ſquyer anſwered
and ſayde. Sirs / ſithe it behoueth me to ſay
the trouthe I ſhall.
            Whan I departed from them fro Newcaſtell
there was none aparence of their aſſemblyng / 
but they be on a redyneſſe to departe / 
as well to daye as to morowe. And as ſoone
as they knowe that ye ſet forwarde and entre
in to Englande / they wyll nat come to mete
with you / for they be nat of ye power ſo to do / 
nor to fyght with you / ſythe ye be ſo great a
nombre / as it is ſayd in Englande that ye be.
Why quod the erle of Moret: what nombre
do they repute vs at? Sir quod he it is ſayd
howe ye be a .xl. thouſande men and .xii. hundred
ſpeares. And ſir / if ye take the waye in
to Gales they wyll go by Berwike / and ſo to
Donbare / to Edenborome / or els to Alqueſt.
and if ye take nat that waye than they wyll
go by Carlyle / and in to the mountayns of yt
countrey. Whan the lordes herde that / eche of
them regarded other. Than the Englyſſhe
ſquyer was putte to the kepyng of the Conſtable
of Gedeours / and cōmaunded that he
ſhulde be ſurely kepte: than in the ſame place
they wente agayne to counſayle.
            
               
THe lordes of Scotlande were ryght
ioyfull of that they knewe ſurely the
entent of their ennemyes / and than they demaunded
counſayle what waye was beſt for
them to take. The mooſt wyſeſt and beſt experte
in warre ſpake fyrſt / and that was ſir
Archanbas Duglas and therle of Fenne / ſir
Alyſander Ramſey / ſir Iohan Saynt clere / 
and ſir Iames Lymſey: They ſayd for feare
of faylynge of our entent / we counſayle that
we make two armyes / to the entente that our
ennemyes ſhall nat knowe whervnto to attende.
And lette the mooſt parte of our hooſt
and caryage go by Carleon in Galles / and
lette the other company (of a thre or four hū
               dred
ſpeares and two thouſāde of other well
horſed) drawe towardes Newcaſtell vpon
Tyne / and paſſe the ryuer and entre in to the
byſſhorike of Durham / and burne and exyle
the countrey. We ſhall make a great breull
in Englande or our ennemyes be prouyded / 
And if weſe that they do folowe vs (as they
wyll do) Than lette vs drawe all oure companyes
toguyder / and take a good place and
fyght with them. We doute nat but we ſhall
haue honoure. Than lette vs be reuenged of
the dommages they haue done to vs. This
counſayle was accepted / and ordayned that
ſir Archanbas Duglas / therle of Fenne / the
erle of Surlancke / the erle of Monſtres / the
erle of Mare / therle of Aſtroderne / ſir Stephyn
of Freſeyle / ſir George of Donbare / 
and ſirtene other great lordes of Scotlande
ſhulde lede the mooſt parte of the armye towardes
Carlyle. And the erle Duglas / ſir
Orge erle of Mare and of Donbare / and the
erle Iohan of Morette. Theſe thre to be capitaynes
of thre hundred ſpeares of choſen
men / and of two thouſande other men and
archers / and they to go towardes Newcaſtell
and entre in to Northūberlande. Thus
theſe two hooſtes departed eche from other / 
eche of them prayenge other / that if the Englyſſhmen
folowed any of their armyes / nat
to fyght with them / tyll bothe their armyes
were ioyned toguyder. Thus in a
mornyng they departed fro
Gedeours and toke
the feldes.

            ¶Howe the erle Duglas wanne the
penon of ſir Henry Percy / at the barryers
before Newcaſtell vpontyne:
and howe the ſcottes brente the caſtell
of Pondlen / and howe ſir Henry
Percy and ſir Rafe his brother toke
aduyſe to folowe the ſcottes to conquere
agayne the penone that was
loſt at the ſcrimyſſhe. Cap. C .xli.
            
               WHan̄e the Englyſſhe
lordes ſawe that their ſquier
retourned at agayne / at
the tyme apoynted / & coud
knowe nothynge what the
ſcottes dyd / nor what they
were purpoſed to do / than
they thought well ye their ſquyer was taken.
The lordꝭ ſent eche to other to be redy whan
ſoeuer they ſhulde here that the ſcottꝭ were a
brode / as for their meſſanger they thought
hym but loſt. ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the
erle Duglas and other / for they had more to
do than they that wente by Carlyle.
            Whan the erles of Duglas / of Moret / of
de la Mare / and Donbare departed fro the
great hooſt: they toke their waye / thynkyng
to paſſe the water / and to entre in to the byſſhoprike
of Durham / and to ryde to ye towne
and than to retourne / brinnyng and exyling
the countrey / and ſo to come to Newcaſtell / 
and to lodge there in the towne in the diſpite
of all the Englyſſhe men. And as they determyned
ſo ſo they dyde aſſaye to putte it in vre / 
for they rode a great paſe vnder couert / with
out doyng of any pyllage by the waye / or aſſautyng
of any caſtell / towre / or houſe: But
ſo came in to the lorde Percyes lande & paſſed
the ryuer of Tyne without any let / a thre
leages aboue Newcaſtell nat farre fro Braſpathe / 
and at laſt entred in to the biſſhoprike
of Durham / where they founde a good countrey.
Than they beganne to make warre / to
ſlee people and to brinne vyllages / and to do
many ſore diſpleaſures. As at that tyme the
erle of Northumberlande and the other lordes
and knyghtes of that countrey knewe nothyng
of their cōmyng. Whan tidynges cāe
to Newcaſtell and to Durham / that the ſcottes

were abrode / and that they myght well ſe
by the fiers and ſmoke abrode in the countrey.
The erle ſente to Newcaſtell his two ſonnes / 
and ſente commaundemente to euery man to
drawe to Newcaſtell / ſayenge to his ſonnes.
ye ſhall go to Newcaſtell and all the countrey
ſhall aſſemble there / and I ſhall tary at Nymyche / 
whiche is a paſſage that they muſte
paſſe by / if we may encloſe them we ſhall ſpede
well. Sir Henry Percy and ſyr Rafe his brother
obeyed their fathers cōmaundement / and
came thyder with them of the countrey. The
ſcottes rode burnynge and exylynge the countrey / 
that the ſmoke therof came to Newe caſtell.
The ſcottes came to the gates of Durham
and ſkrymyſſhed there / but they taryed
nat longe / but returned as they had ordeyned
before to do / and that they founde by the waye
toke and diſtroyed it. Bytwene Durham and
Newcaſtell is but twelue leages englyſſh and
a good countrey. There was no towne without
it were cloſed / but it was brente / and they
repaſſed the Ryuer of Tyne / where they had
paſſed before / & than came before Newcaſtell / 
and there reſted. All the Englyſſhe knyghtes
and ſquyers of the countrey of yorke and byſſhoprike
of Durham were aſſēbled at Newecaſtell / 
and thyder came the ſeneſchall of yorke
ſir Rafe Mombraye / ſyr Rafe Redmayne capytayne
of Berwyke / ſir Roberte Angle / ſyr
Thomas Grey / ſir Thomas Holcon / ſir Iohan
Felton / ſyr Iohan Lyerborne / ſyr Thomas
Abyton / the baron of Helcon / ſir Iohan
Copuldyke & dyuers other / ſo that the towne
was ſo full of people that they wyſt nat where
to lodge.
            WHan theſe thre ſcottyſſhe erles (who
were chyefe capytaynes) had made
their enterpriſe in the byſſhoprike of
Durham / and had ſore ouer rynne the countrey / 
than they retourned to Newcaſtell / and
there reſted and taryed two dayes / and euery
day they ſkrymyſſhed. The erle of Northumberlandes
two ſonnes were two yonge luſty
knyghtes / and were euer formaſte at the barryers
to ſkrymyſſhe. There were many proper
feates of armes done and archyued / there
was fyghtynge hande to hande (Amonge other)
there fought hande to hande the erle Duglas
and ſir Henry Percy / and by force of armes
the erle Duglas wanne the penon of ſyr
Henry Percyes / wherwith he was ſore dyſpleaſed / 
and ſo were all the englyſſhmen / and
the erle Duglas ſayd to ſir Henry Perey. ſyr / 
I ſhall beare this token of your prowes in to
Scotlande / and ſhall ſette it on hyghe on my
caſtell of Alqueſt / that it may be ſene farre of.
Syr quod ſir Henry / ye maye be ſure ye ſhall
nat paſſe the boundes of this countrey tyll ye
be met withall / in ſuch wyſe that ye ſhall make
none auaunte therof. Well ſyr ꝙ the erle Duglas / 
come this nyght to my lodgynge and
ſeke for your penon / I ſhall ſette it before my
lodgynge / and ſe if ye wyll come to take it away.
As than it was late and the ſcottes withdrewe
to their lodginges / and refreſſhed them
with ſuch as they had they had fleſhe ynough.
They made that nyght good watche / for they
thought ſurely to be a waked / for the wordes
they hadde ſpoken / but they were nat: For ſyr
Henry Percy was counſayled nat ſoo to do.
The nexte day the ſcottes dyſlodged and returned
towardes their owne countrey / and ſo
came to a caſtell and a towne called Pouclan / 
wherof 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Haymon of Alphell was lorde / who
was a ryght good knyght. There the ſcottes
reſted / for they came thyder by tymes / and vnderſtode
that the knyght was in his Caſtell.
Than they ordeyned to aſſayle the caſtell and
gaue a great aſſaute / ſo that by force of armes
they wan it / and the knyght within it. Than
the towne and caſtell was brent / and fro thens
the Scottes wente to the towne and caſtell of
Combur / and eyght englyſſhe myle fro Newe
caſtell and there lodged. That day they made
none aſſaut / but the next mornyng they blewe
their hornes / and made redy to aſſayle the caſtell
whiche was ſtronge / for it ſtode in the mareſſe.
That daye they aſſauted tyll they were
wery / and dyd nothynge. Than they ſowned
the retrayte / and retourned to their lodgyng.
Than the lordes drewe to counſayle to determyne
what they ſhulde do. The moſte parte
were of the acorde that the next day they ſhuld
dyſſoge without gyuynge of any aſſaute / and
to drawe fayre and eaſly towardes Carlyle.
but therle Duglas brake that counſayle / and
ſayd. in diſpyte of ſir Henry Percy (who ſayd
he wolde come and wynne agayne his penon)
let vs nat departe hence for two or thre dayes / 
lette vs aſſayle this caſtell / it is prignable? we
ſhall haue double honour? and than lette vs
ſe if he wyll come and fetche his penon / he ſhall

be well defended. Euery man acorded to his
ſayeng / what for their honour and for the loue
of hym. Alſo they lodged there at their eaſe / 
for there was none that troubled theym / they
made many lodgynges of bowes and great
herbes / and fortityed their campe ſagely with
the mareſſe that was therby / and their caryages
were ſette at the entre in to the mareſſes / 
and had all their beeſtes within the mareſſe.
Than they aparelled for to ſaute the next day / 
this was their entenſyon.
            NOwe lette vs ſpeke of ſir Henry Percy
and of ſir Rafe his brother / and ſhewe
ſome what that they dyd. They were ſore dyſpleaſed
that therle Duglas had wonne the penon
of their armes alſo it touched gretly their
honours if they dyd nat as ſyr Henry Percy
ſayd he wolde. For he had ſayd to the erle Duglas
that he ſhulde nat cary his penon out of
Englande / and alſo he had openly ſpoken it be
fore all the knyghtes and ſquiers that were at
Newcaſtell. The englyſſhmen there thought
ſurely that therle Duglas bande was but the
ſcottes vangarde / and that their hooſt was
lefte behynde. The knyghtes of the countrey
ſuche as were well experte in armes / ſpake agaynſt
ſir Henry Percyes opinyon / and ſayd
to hym. Syr / there fortuneth in warre often
tymes many loſſes / if the Erle Duglas haue
wonne your penon / he bought it dere / for he
came to the gate to ſeke it / and was well beaten / 
Another day ye ſhall wynne as moche of
hym or more. Syr / we ſaye this bycauſe we
knowe well all the power of Scotlande is abrode
in the feldes / and if we iſſue out and be
nat men ynowe to fyght with them / and peraduenture
they haue made this ſkrimyſſhe with
vs / to the entent to drawe vs out of the towne / 
and the nombre that they be of as it is ſayd / aboue.
xl. thouſande men / they maye ſoone incloſe
vs / and do with vs what they wyll. yet
it were better to leſe a penon / than two or thre
hundred knyghtes and ſquyers / and put all
our countrey in aduenture. Theſe wordes refrayned
ſyr Henry and his brother / for they
wolde do nothynge agaynſt counſayle. Than
tydynges came to theym by ſuche as had ſene
the Scottes / and ſene all their demeanoure / 
and what waye they toke / and where they reſted.
         
         
            ¶Howe ſyr Henry Percy and his
brother with a good nombre of men
of armes and archers went after the
ſcottes to wynne agayne his penon / 
that the erle Duglas hadde wonne
before Newcaſtell vpon Tyne / and
howe they aſſailed the ſcottes before
Mountberke in their lodgynges.
Cap. C.xlii.
            
               IT was ſhewed to ſir
Henry Percy & to his broder / 
and to the other knightes
and ſquyers that were
there by ſuche as had folowed
the ſcottes fro Newecaſtell / 
and had well aduyſed
their doynge / who ſaid to ſir Henry and to
ſyr Rafe. Syrs / we haue folowed the ſcottes
priuely / and haue diſcouered all the countrey.
The ſcottes be at Pountclan / and haue taken
ſyr Haymon Alphell in his owne caſtell / & fro
thence they be gone to Ottenburge / and there
they laye this nyght / what they wyll do to morowe
we knowe nat. They are ordayned to abyde
there / and ſirs / ſurely their great hooſt is
nat with them / for in all they paſſe nat there a
thre thouſāde men. Whan ſir Henry herde that
he was ioyfull and ſayd. Syrs let vs leape on
our horſes / for by the faythe Iowe to god and
to my lorde my father / I wyll go ſeke for my
penon / and dyſlodge theym this ſame nyght.
Knyghtes and ſquiers that herde him agreed
therto and were ioyous / and euery man made
hym redy. The ſame euenynge the byſſhop of
Durham came thyder with a good company / 
for he herde at Durham howe the ſcottes were
before Newcaſtell / and howe that the lorde
Percies ſonnes with other lordes and knightes
ſhulde fight with the ſcottes. Therfore the
byſſhoppe of Dutham to come to the reſkewe
had aſſembled vp all the countrey / and ſo was
comynge to Newcaſtell. But ſir Henry Percy
wolde nat abyde his comynge / for he had
with hym ſyre hundred ſpeares knightes and
ſquiers / and an eight thouſande fotemen / they
thought that ſufficyent nombre to fyght with
the ſcottes / if they were nat but thre hundred
ſpeares / & thre thouſande of other. Thus they
departed fro Newcaſtell after dyner / and ſet

forth in good ordre / and toke the ſame way as
the ſcottes had gone and rode to Ottebourge
a ſeuen lytell leages fro thence / and fayre way / 
but they coulde nat ryde faſte bycauſe of their
fotemen. And whan ye ſcottes had ſupped and
ſome layde downe to their reſt / and were wery
of trauaylynge and ſautynge of the caſtell all
that day / and thought to ryſe erly in the mornyng
in cole of the day to gyue a newe aſſaute.
Therwith ſodenly the englyſſhmen came on
them and entred in to the lodginges / wenyng
it had ben the maiſters lodgynges / and therin
were but varlettes and ſeruauntes. Than the
englyſſhmen cryed Percy Percy / and entred
into the lodgynges. and ye knowe well where
ſuche affray is / noyſe is ſone reyſed. and it fortuned
well for the ſcottes / for whan they ſawe
the englyſſhmen came to wake them / than the
lordes ſente a certayne of their ſeruauntes of
fotemen / to ſkrymyſſhe with the englyſſhmen
at the entre of the lodgynges / and in ye meane
tyme they armed and aparelled them / euery
man vnder his baner & vnder his capytaynes
penon. The night was farre on / but the mone
ſhone ſo bryght as and it had ben in a maner
daye / it was in the moneth of Auguſt and the
wether fayre and temperate.
            THus the ſcottes were drawen to gyder
and without any noyſe departed fro
their lodgynges & went aboute a lytell mountayne / 
whiche was greatly for their aduauntage / 
for all the day before they had well aduyſed
the place / and ſayd amonge them ſelfe. If
the englyſſhemen come on vs ſodaynly / than
we wyll do thus & thus / for it is a ioperdous
thyng in the nyght / if men of warre entre into
our lodgynges / if they do than we wyll drawe
to ſuche a place / & therby outher we ſhall wyn
or leſe. Whan the englyſſhmen entred in to the
felde / at the firſt they ſoone ouercame the varlettes / 
and as they entred further in alwayes
they foūde newe men to beſy them and to ſkrymyſſhe
with them. Than ſodaynly came the
ſcottes fro aboute the mountayne / and ſette on
the englyſſhmen or they were ware / and cryed
their cryes wherof the englyſſhe menne were
ſore aſtonyed. Than they cryed Percy / and
the other partye cryed Duglas. There began
a cruell batayle / and at the fyrſt encountre many
were ouerthrowen of bothe partyes. And
bycauſe the engliſſhmen were a great nombre
and greatly deſyred to vanquyſſhe their enemyes / 
and reſted at their pas and greatly dyd
put a backe the ſcottes / ſo that the ſcottes were
nere dyſcomfyted. Than the erle Iames Duglas
(who was yonge & ſtronge / and of great
deſyre to gette prayſe and grace / and was wyllynge
to deſerue to haue it / and cared for no
payne nor trauayle) came forthe with his baner
and cryed Duglas Duglas. And ſir Henry
Percy and ſyr Rafe his brother / who had
great indygnacion agaynſt the erle Duglas / 
bycauſe he had wonne the penon of their armes
at the barryers before Newcaſtell / came
to that parte / and cryed Percy / their two baners
mette and their menne / there was a ſore
fyght. The englyſſhmen were ſo ſtronge and
fought ſo valyauntly that they reculed the ſcottes
backe. There were two valiaunt knightes
of ſcottes / vnder the baner of the erle Duglas
called ſyr Patryke of Helborne and ſyr Patryke
his ſonne / they acquyted them ſelfe that
day valy auntly. the erles baner had ben won
and they had nat ben / they defended it ſo valyauntly / 
and in the reſcuynge therof dyd ſuche
feates of armes / that it was greatly to their recommendacyon / 
and to their heyres for euer
after.
            IT was ſhewed me by ſuche as had been
at the ſame batayle / as well by knyghtes
and ſquyers of Englande as of Scotlande / 
at the houſe of the erle of Foiz. for anone after
this batayle was done I met at Ortays two
ſquyers of Englande called Iohan of Newecaſtell / 
and Iohan of Cauteron. alſo whan I
retourned fro Auignon I founde alſo there a
knyght and a ſquyer of Scotlande / I knewe
them and they knewe me / byſuche tokens as
I ſhewed them of their countrey / for I auctor
of this boke in my youthe had rydden nygh ouer
all the realme of Scotland / and I was as
than a fyftene dayes in the houſe of erle wyllyam
Duglas / father to the ſame erle Iames
of whome I ſpake of nowe.
            In a caſtell a fyue leages fro Edenboro win
the countrey of Alqueſt / the ſame tyme I ſawe
there this Erle Iames a fayre yonge chylde / 
and a ſuſter of his called the lady Blaunche / 
and I was enfourmed by bothe theſe parties / 
how this batayle was as ſore a batayle fought
as lyghtly hath been harde of before of ſuche a

nombre / and I beleue it well / for englyſſhmen
on the one partye and ſcottes on the other party / 
are good men of warre / for whan they mete
there is a harde ſight without ſparynge. there
is no hoo bytwene them as longe as ſpeares / 
ſwordes / ares / or dagers wyll endure / but lay
on eche vpon other. and whan they be well beaten
and that the one parte hath optaygned the
victory / they than glorifye ſo in their dedes of
arme
                  •
                and are ſo ioyfull / that ſuche as be taken
they ſhall be raunſomed or they go out of
the

               elde / ſo that ſhortely eche of them is ſo contente
with other / that at their deparrynge curtoyſly
they wyll ſaye / god thanke you. But in
fyghtynge one with another there is no playe
nor ſparynge / and this is trewe / and that ſhall
well apere by this ſayd rencountec / for it was
as valyauntly foughten as coulde be deuyſed /

               KNyghtes and Squyers
were of good corage on
bothe parties to fyght valyauntly.
cowardes there had
no place / but hardynes rayned
with goodly feates of
armes / for knyghtes and
ſquiers were ſo ioyned to gyder at hande ſtrokes / 
that archers had no place of nother party.
There the ſcottes ſhewed great hardyneſſe / 
and feught meryly / with great deſyre of honour.
the englyſſhmen were thre to one / howe
be it I ſay nat but englyſſhmen dyd nobly acquyte
them ſelfe for euer the englyſſhmen had
rather ben ſlayne or taken in the place / than to
flye. Thus as I haue ſayd the baners of Duglas
and Percy and their men / were met eche
againſt other / enuyous who ſhulde wynne the
honoure of that iourney. At the begynnynge
the englyſſhemen were ſo ſtronge / that they

                  •
               eculed backe their enemyes. Than the Erle
Duglas who was of great harte and hygh of
enterpriſe / ſeynge his men recule backe / than
to recouer the place and to ſhewe knightly valure / 
he toke his are in bothe his handes and
entred ſo in to ye preaſe / that he made hym ſelfe
waye / in ſuche wyſe / that none durſte aproche
nere hym / and he was ſo well armed that he
bare well of ſuche ſtrokes as he receyued. thus
he wente euer forwarde lyke a hardy Hector / 
wyllynge a lone to conquere the felde / and to
dyſcomfyte his enemyes. But at laſte he was
encountred with thre ſpeares all at ones / the
one ſtrake hym on the ſhulder / the other on the
breſte / and the ſtroke glented downe to his bely / 
and the thyrde ſtrake hym in the thye / and
ſore hurte with all thre ſtrokes / ſo that he was
borne perforce to the erthe / and after that he
coulde nat be agayne releued. Some of his
knyghtes and ſquyers folowed hym / but nat
all / for it was nyght and no lyght / but by the
ſhynynge of the mone. the engliſſhmen knewe
well they had borne one downe to the erth / but
they wyſt nat who it was / for if they had knowen
that it had ben the erle Duglas / they had
been therof ſo ioyfull and ſo prowde / that the
vyctory had been theirs. Nor alſo the ſcottes
knew nat of that aduenture tyll the ende of the
batayle / for if they had knowen it / they ſhulde
haue been ſo ſore dyſpayred and dyſcoraged / 
that they wolde haue fledde awaye. Thus as
the erle Duglas was felled to the erth he was
ſtriken in to the heed with an axe / and another
ſtroke throughe the thye. The englyſſhe men
paſſed for the and tooke no hede of hym / they

was ſore hurte / and taken pryſoner
by a ſcottyſſhe knyght.
Cap. C.xliiii.
            
            
               OF all the bataylles and encountrynges
that I haue made
melicion of here before in all this
hyſtory / great or ſmalle / this batayle
that I treate of nowe / was
one of the ſoreſt and beſt foughten / without cowardes
or faynte hertes. for there was nother
knyght nor ſquyer but that dyde his deuoyre
and fought hande to hande. this batayle was
lyke the batayle of Bechercll / the whiche was
valyauntly fought and endured. The erle of
Northumberlandes ſonnes / ſir Henry and ſir
Rafe Percy / who were chefe ſouerayne capytayns
acquyted them ſelfe nobly / and ſir Rafe
Percy entred in ſo farre amonge his enemyes
that he was cloſed in / and hurte / and ſo ſore
handeled that his brethe was ſo ſhorte that he
was taken pryſoner / by a knyght of the erle of
Morettes / called ſir Iohan Makyrell. In the
takynge the Scottyſſhe knyght demaunded
what he was (for it was in the nyght / ſo that
he knewe hym nat) And ſyr Rafe was ſo ſore
ouercome and bledde faſt that at laſte he ſayd / 
I am Rafe Percy. Than the ſcotte ſayde / ſyr
Rafe reſkewe or no reſkewe I take you for my
priſoner / I am Makyrell. Well quod ſir Rafe
I am contente / but than take hede to me / for I
am ſore hurte / my hoſen and my greues are
full of blode. Than the knyght ſawe by hym
the erle Moret / and ſayde. Syr here I delyuer
to you ſyr Rafe Percy as priſoner / but ſir / 
lette good hede be taken to hym / for he is ſore
hurte. The erle was ioyfull of thoſe wordes / 
and ſayd. Makyrell thou haſt well wonne thy
ſpurres. Than he delyuered ſyr Rafe Percy
to certayne of his men / and they ſtopped and
wrapped his woundes / And ſtyll the batayle
endured / nat knowynge who had as than the
better / for there were many taken and reſkewed
agayne / that came to no knowledge.
            NOwe let vs ſpeke of the yonge Iames
erle of Duglas / who dyd maruayls in
armes or he was beaten downe. Whan he was
ouerthrowen the preace was great about him / 
ſo that he coulde nat releue / for with an axe he
had his dethes woūde. His men folowed him
as nere as they coulde / and there came to hym
ſyr Iames Lymſey his coſyn / and ſyr Iohan
and ſir Water ſaynt clere / and other knyghtes
and ſquiers / and by hym was a gentle knyght
of his who folowed him all the day / and a chapelayne
of his / nat lyke a preeſt / but lyke a valyaunt
man of Armes / for all that night he folowed
the erle with a good are in his handes / 
and ſtyll ſkrymyſſhed aboute the erle / there as
he lay / and reculed backe ſome of the engliſſhe
men with gret ſtrokes that he gaue. Thus he
was founde fyghtynge nere to his mayſter / 
wherby he hadde great prayſe / and therby the
ſame yere he was made archedecon of Abredan.
This preeſt was called ſyr Willyam of
Norbernyche / he was a tall man and a hardy
and was ſore hurte. Whanne theſe knyghtes
came to the Erle they founde hym in an yuell
caſe / and a knyght of his lyenge by hym / called
ſir Roberte Harte / he had a fyftene woundes
in one place and other. Than ſyr Iohan
Sayncte clere demaunded of the erle howe he
dyd. Ryght yuell coſyn quod therle / but thanked
be god there hath been but a fewe of myne
auncytours that hathe dyed in their beddes.
But coſyn / I requyre you thynke to reuenge
me / for I recon my ſelfe but deed / for my herte
faynteth often tymes / My coſyn water and
you I praye you rayſe vp agayne my baner / 
whiche lyeth on the grounde / and my ſquyer
Dauy Collemnie ſlayne. But ſyrs / ſhewe nother
to frende nor ſoo in what caſe ye ſeme in / 
for if myne enemyes knewe it they wolde reioyſe / 
and our frendes diſcomforted. The two
bretherne of Saynt clere and ſir Iames Lymſcy
dyd as the erle hadde deſyred theym / and
reyſed vp agayne his baner / and cryed Duglas.
Suche as were behynde and herde that
crye drewe togyther and ſet on their enemyes
valyauntly / and reculed backe the englyſſhe
men / and many ouerthrowen / and ſo draue the
englyſſhe men backe beyonde the place where
as the Erle laye / who was by that tyme deed / 
and ſo came to the erles baner / the whiche ſyr
Iohan Saynte clere helde in his handes / and
many good knyghtes and ſquyers of Scotlande
aboute hym / and ſtyll company drewe
to the crye of Duglas. Thyder came the erle
Morette with his baner well accompanyed / 
and alſo the erle de la Mare and of Donbare.
And whan they ſawe the engliſſh
men recule / and their cōpany aſſembled
togyder / they renewed agayne
the batayle / 
and gaue many
harde
and ſadde ſtrokes.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe the ſcottes wanne the batayle
agaynſt the englyſſhe men beſyde
Otteburge & there was taken
priſoners ſir Henry and ſir Rafe Percy / 
and howe an Englyſſhe ſquyer
wolde nat yelde him no more wolde
a ſcottyſſhe ſquier and ſo dyed both / 
and howe the byſſhope of Durham
and his company were diſcomfyted
amonge themſelfe. Ca. C .xlv.
            
               TO ſaye trouth the englyſſhmen
were ſorer trauayled
than the ſcottes / for
they came the ſame day fro
Newcaſtell vpon Tyne / a
ſire englyſſh myles / & went
a great paſe / to the entente
to fynde the ſcottes whiche they dyd ſo that by
their faſt goynge they were nere out of brethe / 
and the Scottes were freſſhe and well reſted / 
which greatly auayled them / whan tyme was
of their buſyneſſe. For in the laſte ſkrymyſſhe
they reeuled backe the englyſſhemen / in ſuche
wyſe / that after that they coude no more aſſemble
togyther / for the ſcottes paſt through their
batayles. And it fortuned that ſir Henry Percy
and the lorde of Mountcombre a valyaunt
knyght of Scotlande fought togyther hande
to hande ryght valyauntly / without lettynge
of any other for euery man had ynough to do.
So longe they two fought that perforce of armes
ſyr Henry Percy was taken priſoner by
the ſayde lorde of Mountcomber.
            THe knyghtes & ſquiers of Scotlande
as ſir Mare Adremench / ſir Thomas
Auerneſquyn / ſyr Willyam / ſyr Iames / and
ſir Alyſander Lymſey / the lorde of Faulcon / 
for Iohan of ſaynte de Laur / ſyr Patryke of
Donbare / ſir Iohan and ſyr Water Saynte
clere / ſir Iohan Makyrcll ſir Guyſtewarde / 
ſyr Iohan Halebreton ſyr Alyſaunder Ramſey / 
Roberte Colounnie and his two ſonnes / 
Iohan and Roberte / who were there made
knyghtes / and a hundred knyghtes and ſquyers
that I can nat name. All theſe ryght valyauntly
dyd acquyte them ſelfe. And on the englyſſhe
parte before that the lorde Percy was
taken and after / there fought valyauntly ſyr
Rafe Longeble / ſyr Mathewe Redman / ſyr
Thomas Ogle / ſir Thomas Gray / ſir Thomas
Hekon / ſir Thomas Abreton / ſir Iohan
Lyerbon / ſir Willyam Walſyngham / the baron
of Helcon / ſir Iohan of Culpedup / the ſeneſchall
of yorke / and dyuers other fotemen.
Wherto ſhould I write longe proces / this was
a ſore batayle and well foughten? And as fortune
is alwayes chaungeable / though the engliſſhmen
were more in nombre than the ſcottes / 
and were ryght valyaunt men of warre / 
and well experte / and that at the fyrſte fronte
they reculed backe the ſcottes / yet fynally the
ſcottes optaygned the place and vyctory / and
all the foreſaid englyſſhmen taken and a hundred
mo / ſauynge ſir Mathewe Rodman capytayne
of Berwyke / who whan he knewe no
remedy nor recoueraunce / and ſawe his company
flye fro the ſcottes / and yelded theym on
euery ſyde / than he toke his horſe and departed
to ſaue hym ſelfe. The ſame ſeaſon aboute
the ende of this dyſcomfyture / there was an
englyſſhe ſquyer called Thomas Veleton / a
goodly and a valyant man / and that was well
ſene / for of all that nyght he wolde nother flye
nor yet yelde hym. It was ſayd he had made a
vowe at a feeſt in Englande / that the firſt tyme
that euer he ſawe engliſſhe men & ſcottes in batayle / 
he wolde / ſo do his deuoyre to his power
in ſuche wyſe / that eyther he wolde be reputed
for the beſt doer on bothe ſydes / or els to dye in
the payne / he was called a valyaunt and a hardy
man / and dyd ſo moche by his prowes that
vnder the baner of the erle of Morette he dyd
ſuche valyauntneſſe in armes / that the ſcottes
hadde maruayle therof / and ſo was ſlayne in
fyghtynge. The ſcottes wolde gladly haue taken
hym alyue but he wolde neuer yelde / he
hoped euer to haue been reſcewed. And with
him there was a ſcottyſſhe ſquier ſlayne / coſyn
to the kynge of ſcottes / called Symon Glaudyn.
His dethe was greatly complayned of
the ſcottes. This batayle was fierſe and cruell
tyll it came to the ende of the diſcomfyture / but
whan the ſcottes ſawe the englyſſhmen recule
and yelde thēſelfe / than the ſcottes were curtes / 
and ſette theym to their raunſome / and euery
manne ſayde to his pryſoner. Syrs / go and
vnarme you and take youre caſe / I am your
mayſter / and ſo made their priſoners as good
chere as though they had ben brethren / without
doyng to thē any dōmage. The chaſ

               ndured

a fyue englyſſhe myles / and if ye ſcottes
had been men ynowe there had none ſcaped / 
but outher they had ben taken or ſlayne:
And if Archambault Duglas and the erle of
Fen / the erle Surlant and other of the great
cōpany (who were gone towardes Carlyle)
had ben there / by all lykelyhode they had taken
the byſſhoppe of Durham / and ye towne
of Newcaſtell vpon tyme. I ſhall ſhewe you
howe. The ſame euenyng that the Percyes
deꝑted fro Newcaſtell (as ye haue herde before)
the byſſhop of Durham with the rerebande
cāe to Newcaſtell & ſupped. And as he
ſatte at the table he had ymagmacion in hym
ſelfe / howe he dyd nat acquite hym ſelfe well
to ſe the Englyſſhe men in the felde / and he
to be within the towne. Incontynent he cauſed
the table to be taken away / and cōmaunded
to ſadell his horſes / and to ſowne the trū
               pettes / 
& called vp men in the towne to arme
them ſelfe and to mount on their horſes / and
foote men to order them ſelfe to departe. And
thus euery man departed out of the towne / 
to the nombre of ſeuyn thouſande: two thouſande
on horſebacke and Fyue thouſande a
fote. They toke their waye towarde Ottenbourg
where as the batayle had ben / and by
that tyme they hadde gone two myle from
Newcaſtell / tidynges came to theym / howe
their men were fightynge with the ſcottes.
Ther with the byſſhoppe reſted there / and
incontynent came mo flyeng faſte / that they
were out of brethe. Than they were demaū
               ded
howe the mater wente: they aunſwered
and ſayde. Right yuell. We be all diſconfyted.
Here cometh the ſcottes chaſynge of vs.
Theſe tidynges troubled the Englyſſhmen
and began to doute. And agayne the thirde
tyme men came flyeng as faſt as they might.
Whan̄e the men of the byſſhoprike of Durham
herde of theſe yuell tidynges they were
abaſſhed / in ſuche wiſe / that they brake their
array / ſo that the byſſhoppe coude nat holde
togyder the nombre of fyue hūdred. It was
thought that if the ſcottes had folowed them
in any nombre: ſeyng that it was night that
in thentryng in to the towne / & the Engliſſh
men ſo abaſſhed / the towne had ben won.
            The byſſhope of Durham beyng in the
felde had good wyll to haue ſocoured the englyſſhmen / 
& recōforted his men aſmoche as
he coude / but he ſawe his owne men flye as
well as other. Than he demaunded couſaile
of ſir Wyllyam Luſſey and of ſir Thomas
Clyfforde and of other knyghtes / what was
was beſt to do. Theſe knyghtes for their honoure
wolde gyue hym no counſayle / For
they thought to retourne agayne and do nothyng / 
ſhulde ſowne greatly to their blame / 
and to go for the myght be to their great dō
               mage / 
and ſo ſtode ſtyll & wolde gyue none
anſwere. and the lengar they ſtode the fewer
they were / for ſome ſtyll ſtale awaye. Than
the byſſhoppe ſayd. Sirs / all thynges conſidred / 
it is none honour to putte all in parell / 
nor to make of one yuell dommage twayne.
We here howe our company be diſconfyted / 
& we can nat remedy it: For to go to recouer
them / we knowe nat with whom nor wt what
nombre we ſhall mete. Lette vs retourne
fayre and eaſely for this night to Newcaſtell
and to more we lette vs drawe toguyder and
go loke on our enemyes. Euery man anſwered / 
as god wyll ſo be it. Therwith they retourned
to Newcaſtell. Thus a man maye
conſyder the great defaute that is in men / yt
be abaſſhed and diſconfyted. For if they had
kepte them togyder / and haue turned agayn
ſuche as fledde / they had diſconfyted the ſcottes.
This was the opynion of dyuers. And
bycauſe they dyde nat thus / the ſcottes had
the vyctorie.

Lymſay ye are taken / yelde ye to me. Who be
you quod Lymſay? I am ꝙ he the byſſhop
of Durham. And fro whens come you ſir ꝙ
Lymſay? I come fro the batayle ꝙ the byſſhop / 
but I ſtroke neuer a ſtroke there. I 
                  〈◊〉
               
backe to Newcaſtell for this night / & ye ſhal
go with me. I maye nat choſe quod Lymſay
ſithe ye wyll haue it ſo. I haue taken and I
am taken / ſuche is the aduentures of armes.
Whom haue ye taken quod the byſſhop? ſir
quod he I toke in the chaſe ſir Mathue Redman:
And where is he quod the byſſhop? by
my faythe ſir he is retourned to Newcaſtell / 
he deſyred me to truſt hym on his faythe for
thre wekes / and ſo haue I done. Well ꝙ the
byſſhop / lette vs go to Newcaſtell and there
ye ſhall ſpeke with hym. Thus they rede to
Newcaſtell toguyder / and ſir Iames Lymſay
was priſoner to the biſſhop of Durham.
            VNder the baner of therle de la mare
and of Dōbare / was taken aſquer
of Gaſcone called Iohn̄ of Newcaſtell.
And vnder the baner of the erle of Moret
was taken his companyon Iohn̄ de Cauteron.
Thus the felde was clene auoyded or
the daye apered. The ſcottes drewe togyder
and toke guydes and ſente out ſcurrers to ſe
if any men were in the waye fro Newcaſtell
to the entent that they wolde nat be troubled
in their lodgynges / wherin they dyd wiſely.
For whan ye byſſhop of Durham was come
agayne to Newcaſtell & in his lodgynge / he
was ſore pēſyfe / & wyſt nat what to ſaye nor
do: For he herde ſay howe his coſyns ye Percies
were ſlayne or taken / & all ye knightes yt
were with thē. Than he ſent for all ye knyghtes
and ſquyers that were in the towne / And
whan they were come he demaunded of thē / 

if they ſhulde leaue the mater in that caſe / &
ſayde. Sirs / we ſhall beare great blame / if
we thus retourne without lokynge on oure
ennemyes. Than they cōcluded by the ſonne
ryſynge / euery manne to be armed / and on
horſ backe and a foote / to departe out of the
towne / and to go to Octenbourge to fyght
with the ſcottes. this was warned through
the towne by a trumpet / and euery man armed
theym and aſſembled before the bridge:
And by the ſonne ryſynge they departed by
the gate towardes Berwyke / and tooke the
waye towardes Octebourge / to the nombre
of tenne thouſande / what a foote and a horſe
backe. They were nat gone paſte two myle
fro Newcaſtell / whan the ſcottes were ſygnefyed
that the byſſhoppe of Durham was
commynge to theym warde to fyght. This
they knewe by their ſpyes / ſuche as they had
ſette in the feldes.
            AFter that ſir Mathewe Reedman
was retourned to Newcaſtell / and
hadde ſhewed to dyuers / howe he
had been taken priſoner by ſir Iames Lymſey.
Than it was ſhewed hym howe the biſſhoppe
of Durham hadde taken the ſayd ſir
Iames Lymſey: and how that he was there
in the towne as his priſoner. As ſoone as the
byſſhoppe was departed / ſir Mathue Reedman
wente to the byſſhoppes lodgyng to ſe
his mayſter / And there he founde hym in a
ſtudye / lyeng in a wyndowe and ſayd. What
ſir Iames Lymſay what make you here?
Than ſir Iames came forthe of the ſtudy to
hym and gaue hym good morowe / and ſayd.
By my faythe ſir Mathewe / fortune hathe
brought me hyder: For as ſoone as I was
departed fro you / I mette by chaunce ye byſſhoppe
of Durham / to whome I am priſoner / 
as ye be to me. I beleue ye ſhall nat nede
to come to Edenborowe to me to make your
fynaunce. I thynke rather we ſhall make an
exchaunge one for another: if the byſſhoppe
be ſo contente. Well ſir quod Reedman / we
ſhall accorde ryght well toguyder / ye ſhall
dyne this daye with me. the byſſhop and our
men be gone forthe to fyght with your men / 
I can nat tell what ſhall fall / we ſhall know
at their retourne. I am content to dyne with
you quod Lymſay. Thus theſe two knyghtes
dyned toguyder in Newcaſtell.
            Whan the knyghtes of Scotlāde were enformed
howe the byſſhop of Durham came
on them with .x. thouſande men / they drewe
to counſayle to ſe what was beſt for them to
do / outher to deꝑte or els to abyde the aduē
               ture.
All thynges conſydred / they concluded
to abyde / For they ſayd they coude nat be in
a better nor a ſtronger place than they were
in alredy. They had many priſoners / & they
coulde nat cary theym awaye if they ſhulde
haue departed. And alſo they hadde many of
their men hurte: and alſo ſome of their priſoners / 
whōe they thought they wolde nat leue
behynde them. Thus they drewe toguyder / 
and ordred ſo their felde / that ther was no entre
but one waye / and they ſette all their priſoners
toguyder. And made them to promiſe
howe that reſcue or no reſcue they ſhulde be
their priſoners. after that they made all their
mynſtrels to blowe vp all atones / and made
the greatteſt reuell of the worlde. Lightlye
it is the vſage of ſcottes / that whan they be
thus aſſembled toguyder in armes / the foote
men bereth about their neckes homes / in maner
lyke hunters / ſome great ſome ſmall / and
of all ſortes: ſo that whan they blowe all at
ones / they make ſuche a noyſe / that it may be
herde nighe .iiii. myles of. thus they do to abaſſ
he their enemyes and to reioyſe them ſelfes.
Whan the byſſhoppe of Durham with
his baner and .x.M. men with hym / were aproched
with in a leage / than ye ſcott
                  •
               s blewe
their hornes / in ſuche wiſe / that it ſemed that
all the deuyls in hell had been amonge them / 
ſo that ſuche as herde them and knewe nat of
their vſage / were ſore abaſſhed. This blowyng
and noyſe endured a longe ſpace / and
than ceſſed. And by that tyme thēglyſſhmen
were within leſſe than a myle / than ye ſcottes
began to blowe agayn & made a great noyſe
and as long endured as it dyd before. Than
the byſſhop aproched with his batayle well
rainged ī good order / & came within ye ſyght
of ye ſcottes / as within .ii. bowe ſhot or leſſe / 
than ye ſcottes blewe again their hornes a lō
               ge
ſpace. ye byſſhop ſtode ſtyll to ſe what the
ſcottes wolde do & auewed thē well / and ſaw
howe they were in a ſtronge grounde / greatlye
to their aduauntage. Than the byſſhop
tooke counſayle / what was beſte for hym to
do. But thynge well aduyſed / they were
nat in purpoſe to entre in amonge the ſcottes

to aſſayle them / but retourned withoute
doyng of any thyng / for they ſawe well they
myght rather leſe than wyn. Whan the ſcottes
ſawe the Englyſſhe men recule / and that
they ſhulde haue no batayle: They wente to
their lodgynges and made mery / and than̄e
ordayned to departe fro thens: And bycauſe
that ſir Rafe Percy was ſore hurte / he deſyred
of his maiſter that he myght retourne to
Newcaſtell or in to ſome place / where as it
pleaſed hym / vnto ſuch tyme as he were hole
of his hurtes. Promyſynge / as ſonne as he
were able to ryde to retourne in to Scotlande / 
outher to Edenborowe or in to any other
place apoynted. The erle of Mare / vuder
whom he was taken / agreed therto / and
delyuered hym a horſe lytter and ſent hym a
waye. And by lyke couenaunt dyuers other
knyghtes & ſquyers were ſuffred to returne / 
and tooke terme outher to retourne / or els to
paye their fynaūce / ſuche as they were apoȳ
               ted
vnto. It was ſhewed me by the informacyon
of the ſcottes / ſuche as had been at this
ſayd batayle / that was bytwene Newcaſtell
and Octeburge / in the yere of our lorde god
a thouſande thre hundred fourſcore and viii.
the .xix. daye of Auguſt: Nowe yt there were
taken priſoners of the Engliſſhe partie. M.
and .xl. men one and other. And ſlayne in the
felde and in the chaſe .xviii. hundred and .xl.
and ſore hurte mo than a thouſande. And of
the ſcottes there were a hundred ſlayne / and
taken in the chaſe mo than two hundred: for
as the Englyſſhmen fledde whan they ſawe
any aduautage / they retourned agayne and
fought. By that meanes the ſcottes were taken
and none otherwyſe. Euery man maye
well conſydre that it was a well fought felde
whan there were ſo many ſlayne and taken
on bothe parties.

            ¶Howe the ſcottes departed and caryed
with them therle Duglas deed
and buryed hym in the abbey of Nimays:
And howe ſir Archambault
Duglas and his company departed
fro before Carlyle / and retourned in
to Scotlande. Cap. C.xlvii.
            
               AFter this batayle thus
furnyſſhed / euery man retourned:
And the erle Duglas
deed body cheſted &
layde in a chare / and with
hym ſir Robert Hart and
Symon Glaudyn. Than
they prepared to departe. So they departed
& ledde with them ſir Henry Percy / and
mo than .xl. knyghtes of Englande / & tooke
the waye to the abbey of Nimay. At their de
partynge they ſette fyre in their lodgynges
and rode all the daye / and yet lay that night
in the Englyſſhe grounde / none denyed thē.
The nexte daye they diſlodged early in the
mornyng / and ſo came that daye to Nimay / 
It is an abbey of blacke monkes on the border
bytwene bothe realmes. There they reſted / 
and buryed the erle Iames Duglas.
The ſeconde daye after his obſequye was
done reuerētly / & on his body layde a tombe
of ſtone / and his baner hangyng ouer hym.
Wheder there were as than any mo Erles of
Duglas / to whome the lande retourned or
nat / I can nat tell. For I ſir Iohn̄ Froiſſart
auctour of this boke was in Scotlande in ye
erles caſtell of Alqueſt / lyueng erle Wyllm̄ / 
at whiche tyme he had two chyldren / a ſonne
and a dought: but after there were many of
the duglaſſes / for I haue ſene a.v. bretherne
all ſquiers bearyng ye name of Duglas / in ye
kyng of Scotlādes houſe Dauid. they were
ſōnes to a knight in Scotlāde called ſir Iames
Duglas. & they bare in their armes golde / 
thre oreyls goules / but as for ye herytage
I knowe nat who had it. As for ſir Archambalt
Duglas of whom I haue ſpoken before
in this hyſto
                  •
               ie in dyuers places / who was a
valyant knight / & gretly redouted of the englyſſhmen / 
he was but a baſtarde.
            Whan theſe ſcottes hadde ben at Nymaye
abbey / and done there all that
they came thyder for. Than they departed
eche fro other and wente in to their
owne countreis / and ſuche as hadde priſoners
ſome ledde them awaye with them / and
ſome were raūſomed and ſuffred to returne.
Thus the Englyſſhe men founde the ſcottes
right curteſſe and gentyll / in their delyueraunce
and raunſome / ſo that they were well
contente. This was ſhewed me in the countrey
of Bierne in the erle of Foiz houſe / by a

knyght named Iohan of Newcaſtell / who
was taken priſoner at the ſame iourney / vnder
the baner of the erle of Mare and Donbare / 
and he greatly prayſed the ſayd erle / for
he ſuffred hym to paſſe in maner / as he deſyred
hym ſelfe.
            Thus theſe men of warre of Scotlande
departed and raunſomed their priſoners / as
ſoone as they myght ryght curtteſly / and ſo
retourned lytell and lytell in to their owne
countreis. And it was ſhewed me / and I beleue
it well / that the ſcottes had by reaſon of
that iourney / two hundred thouſande frankes
for raunſomyng of priſoners. For ſythe
the batayle that was before Streuelyne in
Scotlande / where as ſir Robert of Breuce / 
ſir Wyllyam Duglas / ſir Robert Verſey / ſir
Symon Freſeyle / and other ſcottes chaſed
the Englyſſhmen thre dayes / they neuer had
iourney ſo ꝓfytable nor ſo honorable for thē / 
as this was. Whan tidynges came to the other
company of the ſcottes that were beſyde
Carlyle / howe their company had diſtreſſed
the Englyſſhe men beſyde Octeburgh / they
were greatly reioyſed / & diſpleaſed in their
myndes / that they had nat ben there. Than
they determyned to diſlodge and to drawe
in to their owne countreys / ſeynge their other
company were withdrawen. thus they
diſlodged and entred in to Scotlāde.
            ¶Nowe lette vs leaue to ſpeke of the ſcottes
and of the Englyſſhe men for this tyme / 
and lette vs retourne to the yonge Charles
of Fraunce / who with a great people wente
in to Almaygne to bringe the duke of Guerles
to reaſon.
            
               WHan the Frenche kynge and all
his armye were paſte the ryuer
of Mueſe at the bridge of Morſay / 
they tooke the waye of Ardayn
and of Luſenbourgh / and
alwayes the pyoners were before beatynge
woodes and buſſhes / & makynge the wayes
playne. The duke of Iulyers and his countrey
greatly douted the comyng of the Frenche
kynge: For they knewe well they ſhulde
haue the fyrſt aſſault and beare the fyrſt burdone / 
and the lande of Iulyers is a playne
coūtrey. In one day the men of warre ſhuld
do moche dōmage there / and diſtroye & waſt
all / excepte the caſtelles and good townes.
Thus the Frenche kyng entred in to the coū
               trey
of Luſenbourgh / and came to an abbey
where as Vyncelant ſomtyme duke of Brabant
was buryed / there the kyng taryed two
dayes. Than he departed and toke the waye
throughe Baſconque / and lodged within a
leage where as the duches of Brabant laye / 
S
                  •
               e ſent worde of her beyng there to ye duke
of Burgoyn / and he brought her in to the
felde to ſpeke with the kynge / who receyued
her right honourably / and there cōmuned togyder.
Than the duches retourned to Baſconque / 
and thyder ſhe was conueyed with
ſir Iohn̄ of Vyen and ſir Guy of Tremoile.
And the next daye the kyng went forwarde / 
aprochyng to the lande of his enemyes / and
came to thē cryng in to Almayne / on the fronters
of ye duchy of Iulyers. but or he came ſo
far forwarde / Arnolde biſſhop of Liege had
been with ye kyng and had greatly entreated
for the duke of Iuliers / that the kyng ſhulde
nat be miſcontent with hym / though he were
father to the duke of Guerles / for he excuſed
hym of the deflaūce that his ſonne had made
affyrmyng / how it was nat by his knowlege
nor conſent. Wherfore he ſayd / it were pytie
that the father ſhulde beare the defaut of the
ſonne. This excuſe was nat ſuffycient to the
kyng nor to his vncles / For the entent of the
kyng and his coūſayle was / without ye duke
of Iulyers wolde come and make other maner
of excuſe / and to yelde hym ſelfe to ye kynges
pleaſure / his countrey ſhulde be the firſt
that ſhulde beare the burdone. Thanne the
byſſhoppe of Liege and the lordes of Haſbane / 
and the counſayls of the good townes / 
offred to the kynge and his counſayle / holly
the byſſhoprike of Liege / for his armye to
paſſe and repaſſe / payeng for their expenſes:
and to reſt and refreſſhe them there / as long
as it pleaſed them. The kyng thanked them
and ſo dyde his vncles / and wolde nat
refuſe their offre / for he knewe
nat what nede he ſhulde
haue after.

            ¶Howe the duke of Iulyers came
and excuſed hym ſelfe / of the defyaū
               ce
that his ſon̄e the duke of Guerles
had made to the Frenche kyng / and
ſo became his ſubiecte: & of dyuers
feates of armes done bytwene the
frenchmen and the almayns before
Rencongne. Cap. C.xlviii.
            
               THus the biſſhoppe of
Liege retourned to the duke
of Iullyers and to the
archebyſſhoppe of Coloigne / 
and ſhewed thē what
he had done and thervpon
they toke aduyſe. The duke
of Iuliers had great dout of cryling & waſtyng
of his countrey / and ſent for the knightes
of his countrey to haue their counſayle &
aduyſe / and dayly the Frenchmen aproched.
The lorde of Coucy who was in ye vowarde
and with hym a thouſande ſpeares / and the
duke of Lorayne with hym: and the vicount
of Meaulx with two hūdred ſpeares. Whan
the Frenche men aproched the fronters of Almayne / 
than they rode toguyder in good order
and lodged wiſely / for there were a thre
hūdred ſpeares of lynſars almayns / beyond
the ryuer of Ryne gathered toguyder. And
they be noted to be the greatteſt pyllers and
robbers of all the worlde: And they alwayes
purſued and cooſted the Frenchmen to fynde
them diſpurueyed / to do them dōmage. The
Frenche men douted the ſame / and durſt neuer
go 
                  •
                forragyng but in great companyes.
And as I vnderſtode ſir Boucequant the elder
and ſir Loyes of Grache / were retayned
and brought to Nimay. theſe ſayd almayns
rode alwayes couertly / lyke byrdes flyeng
in ye ayre ſekyng for their praye. This made
the Frenche men wyſe and to be well ware.
Thus whan the Frenche kyng was come ſo
forwarde / as to the entre of the duchy of Iulyers / 
The duke of Iulyers who wolde nat
leſe his countrey / beleued the coūſayle of the
archebyſſhoppe of Coloyne and the byſſhop
of Liege. Theſe two entreated for hym to ye
kynge and brought the mater to that poynt / 
that his lādes were in reſt and peace / by meanes
of ſuche condycions as foloweth. Theſe
two prelates dyde ſo moche / yt they brought
the duke of Iulyers in to the kynges preſēce
and before his vncles & the duke of Lorayne / 
and other great lordes of Fraunce of ye blode
royall. And whan he was before the kyng he
kneled downe / and wiſely excuſed him of the
defyaūce that his ſonne had made / and ſayd
howe his ſonne was a foole / and that he had
neuer counſayle of hym to do as he dyde / but
dyde it of his owne wyll: and offred ye kyng / 
ſayeng. Sir / to the entent to bring hym to ye
knowledgynge of reaſon / by your lycence I
wyll go to hym and ſhewe hym his folly / as
quickely as I can / and counſayle hym to cōe
and make his excuſe before youre grace and
your counſayle. And if he wyll nat thus do / 
but do agaynſt my counſayle / I ſhall abandon
to you all the townes and caſtels in my
countrey / and to prouyde for men of warre / 
and to make warre againſt hym / tyll ye haue
taken hym to mercy. Than the kyng regarded
his brother / his vncles / and his coūſaile
and it ſemed to hym that this offre was faire
and reſonable / and ſo thought dyuers other.
Than the kyng toke vp the duke of Iulyers
(who was on his kne / whyle he ſpake to the
kyng) and ſayd to hym. Sir / we ſhall take
counſayle and aduyſe on your promyſes and
wordes. Than the duke roſe vp & ſtode ſtyll
by the byſſhoppes that brought hym thyder.
Than the kyng and his vncles / and ſuche of
his ſecrete counſayle drewe toguyder and debated
this mater long / with dyuers opiniōs
The duke of Burgoyne to whom principallye
the mater touched / bicauſe of the duchy of
Brabant / wherin he chalēged to haue great
right of enherytaunce / after the dethe of the
duches Iane / bycauſe of the lady Margaret
his wyfe: and alſo to ſay the trouthe / he was
the chiefe cauſer of the kynges cōmyng thyder
with all yt puiſſaūce. Wherfore he wolde
that euery thyng might be for the beſt and to
thentent that a good peace might be made bitwene
all ꝑties / that there ſhulde be no more
occaſyon to cōe thyder agayne another tyme
bycauſe the voyage is long and coſtly for the
realme: Than he ſayd to the kyng. Sir / and
it lyke your grace & you my brother of Berrey / 
and to you all I ſaye / that in all thynges
yuell begone / lyeth great aduyſe. We here
howe our coſyn the duke of Iulyers greatly

exſcuſeth hymſelfe / and he is ſo valyant a man
and of our blode / and we of his / that we ought
to beleue hym. He offereth to the kyng a great
thyng / his body / his countrey / his townes and
caſtelles / to be at the kynges cōmaundemente / 
in caſe that his ſonne the duke of Guerles wyll
rebell / and come nat to make amendes of the
defyaunce that he hath made. To ſpeke acordynge
to reaſon / it is a great thynge / to haue
with vs the duke of Iuliers / the duke of Guerles
ſhall be the more feble / and the eaſyer to correcte / 
and the more he ſhall dought vs / and ſoner
come to obeyſaunce. wherfore I counſayle
that his offre be nat refuſed / for he mekely humyleth
hymſelfe / and other greate lordes of
Almayne entreate for hym. To theſe wordes
there was no contrary opynyons / but all conſented
by one acorde. Than the byſſhoppes of
Coloygne and of Liege were called to their
counſayle / who had ben chyefe entreatours in
this buſynes / and to them it was declared fro
poynte to poynte / and frome clauſe to clauſe / 
what thynges ye duke of Iulyers ſhulde ſwere
and ſeale to do / if he wolde haue his landes ſaued / 
and to be in reſte. Fyrſt / that he ſhulde go
to his ſonne the duke of Guerles and ſhewe
hym playnely his foly / and the great outrage
that he had done / to ſende to defye ſo puyſſaūt
a prince as the frenche kynge / and ſpecially by
ſuche fell defyaunce / out of the ſtyle of ryght or
reaſon / and to cauſe him to come to reaſon and
mercy. And if he wolde nat thus do / but abyde
ſtyll in his opynyon (through feble wytte and
counſayle) than the duke of Iulyers to ſwere
and ſeale to renounce hym fro all ayde or ſocoure
that he myght do / and to become his enemy / 
as other be / and to ſuffre ſuche as ſhall be
apoynted by the kynge and his counſayle to abyde
there all this wynter / to lye in garyſons
in the countrey of Iulyers / to make frounter
warre agaynſt the duke of Guerles / and there
to be well entreated and receyued.
            THeſe two prelates were called to the
kinges counſayle / to the entente that
they ſhulde ſhewe to the duke of Iulyers
theſe artycles / and ſo they dyd. And than
the duke ſawe well howe that it behoued hym
to agree / or els to haue his landes ouer tynne
and waſted / wherfore he acorded and ſware
and ſealed to vpholde all the kynges deſyre / ſo
that his lande ſhulde nat be ouerron nor exyled / 
and he was contente that his lande ſhulde
vytayle the armye. Thus the duke of Iulyers
became the frenche kynges man / and made relyefe
for his lande of Vierſon / beyng bytwene
Bloys and Berrey / and ſupped that nyght at
the kynges table. Fyrſte ſate the byſſhoppe of
Liege and the byſſhoppe of Coloygne / than
the kynge / the duke of Burgoyne / the duke of
Thowrayn / the duke of Iuliers / and the duke
of Burbone.
            THus the duke of Iulyers was in reſte
and peaſe by the foreſayd meanes / and
the kynge and his armye were lodged in his
countrey / the whiche was pleaſaunt and plentyfull
of all vytayles. Than the duke of Iulyers
wente towardes the duke of Guerles his
ſonne / But or he came there / there was dyuers
feates of armes done in the countrey / for the almayns
who be couetouſe / oftentymes by night
or by daye wolde ieoparde them ſelfe and ſette
on the frenche mens lodgynges to kepe them
wakynge / and ſomtyme they wanne and ſome
tyme they loſt. But for one almayne that was
taken / there were euer four frenchmen taken.
And on a daye the conſtable of Fraunce and
the lorde Coucy / the duke of Lorayne / the marſhall
of Blainuill / ſir Iohan of Vien / ſyr Iohan
de la Tremoyle / & a four thouſande men
of armes came before a towne in Guerles called
Renconge / & ſhewed them ſelfe before it in
good ordre of batayle. The ſame tyme ye duke
of Guerles was within the towne / and prayſed
moche their demeanour / but he made none
iſſue out / for he had nat men ynowe wherof he
was ryght ſore dyſpleaſed. Thus the frenche
men were there in good ordre of batayle the
ſpace of four houres / and whan they ſawe that
none wolde iſſue out / they departed and returned
to their lodgynges. The ſame euenynge
about the duke of Berreys lodgyng / certayne
knyghtes and ſquyers drewe togyther / to the
entent to ryde forthe in the mornynge in to the
lande of their enemies to ſeke ſome aduenture / 
and promyſed eche other to ſtycke togyther
lyke bretherne. They were in nombre aboute
a hundred ſpeares. But whan the mornynge
came all their purpoſe was broken / for there
was a ſquyer of Auuergne called Godinos a
valyaunt man of armes / he pertayned to the
lorde of Alegre. whan he ſawe that they had refuſed
his company / and wolde nat deſyre hym

to go with them / he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and
brake his mynde to a nother ſorte of companyons
/ ſo that they were to the nombre of thyrty
ſpeares. They tode forthe togyther / and rode
all that mornynge and coulde fynde none adventure.
And whan Godynos ſawe that they
ſhulde retourne without doynge of any feate / 
he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and ſayde to his company.
Syrs / ryde on fayre and eaſely / and I
with my page wyll ryde aboute this wode / to
ſe if any enbuſſhe be hydden therin / and tary
me vpon yonder Mountayne. They agreed
to hym. Thus he and his page rode forthe coſtynge
the wode. Whan he had rydden a lytell
waye / he herde one why ſtell in the wode / and
ſtrake his horſe with the ſportes / and came to
the ſyde of the wode / and there he founde an almayne
guetloys cuttynge of wode. Than Godynos
toke his glay
                  •
               e and came ry
                  •
               nynge at
this man / wherof the man was ſore abaſſhed.
Than Godynos made ſygne to hym that he
ſhulde go with him / and thought that this companyons
yet ſhulde ſe that he had founde ſomwhat / 
and thought the ſame manne ſhulde do
them ſome ſeruyce in their lodgynges / and ſo
Godynos rode on before on a lowe hackeney / 
and the almayne folowed hym a foote with a
hewynge axe on his necke / wherwith he had
wrought in the wode. Godinos page lepte on
his mayſters courſer and bare his baſſenette
and ſpeare / and folowed them halfe ſlepynge / 
bycauſe he had ryſen ſo early. And the almayn
who knewe nat whyder he ſhuld go / nor what
they wolde do with hym / thought to delyuer
hymſelfe / and came fayre and eaſely to Godynos / 
and lyfte vp his are and ſtrake hym ſuche
a ſtroke on the heed that he claue it to the teth / 
and ſo ouerthrewe hym ſtarke deed / the page
knewe nat therof tyll he ſawe his mayſter fall.
Than the vyllayne fledde in to the wode and
ſaued hymſelfe. This aduenture fell to Godinos / 
wherwith ſuche as knewe hym were ſore
dyſpleaſed / and ſpecyally they of Auuergne / 
for he was the man of armes that was moſte
doughted of the engliſſhmen in thoſe parties / 
and he that dyd them moſt domage. If he had
been in priſone he ſhulde haue ben quyted out / 
and if it had been for twenty thouſande frankes.
¶Nowe lette vs retourne to the duke of
Iulyers.
         
         
            ¶Howe the duke of Iuliers and the
archebyſſhop of Coloygne departed
fro the frenche kynge / and wente to
Nymay to the duke of Guerles / and
howe by their meanes he was reconſyled
and brought to peace with the
frenche kynge and with the duches
of Brabante. Cap. C.xlix.
            
               YE knowe well / as it hathe
ben ſhewed here before / howe the
duke of Iulyers made his peace
with the frenche king / by meanes
of the byſſhoppes that treated in
that behalfe / and alſo to ſaye the trouthe / the
duke of Lorayne his coſyn toke great payne
in the mater. And (as ye haue herde) the duke
promyſed to go to his ſonne the duke of Guerles / 
and to cauſe hym to come to the kynges
mercy / or els to make hym warre. Thus the
duke of Iulyers was fayne to promyſe / or els
all his countrey had ben loſte. Thus the duke
of Iulyers and the archbyſſhoppe toke their
iourney to go in to Guerles / and paſſed the ryuer
and came to Nymay / where as the duke
was / who receyued his father with great ioye
as he was bounde to do / for there is nothynge
ſo nere a man as his father and mother. But
he was nothynge glad of that he herde howe
that the duke his father was agreed with the
frenche kynge. Than the duke of Iuliers and
the byſſhop ſhewed hym at length the hole mater
in what caſe he and his lande ſtode in. He
made lytle therof / for he was ſo ſore alyed with
the kynge of Englande that he wolde nat forſake
hym / for his herte was good englyſſhe / 
and ſo excuſed hym ſelfe greatly / and ſayde to
his father. ſyr / let me alone / I wyll abyde the
aduenture / and if I take domage by reaſon of
the frenche kynges comynge / I am yonge ynough
to beare it / and to be reuenged herafter
on ſome parte of the realme of Fraunce / or vppon
my neyghbours the brabanſoys. there is
no lorde canne kepe warre without ſome domage / 
ſometyme leſe / and ſometyme wynne.
Whan his father the duke of Iulyers herde
hym ſo ſtyffe in his opynyon / he was ſore dyſpleaſed
with him / and ſayd. Sonne Willyam / 
for whome make you youre warre? and who

be they that ſhall reuenge your domage? Syr
quod he / the kynge of Englande and his puyſaunce / 
and I haue gret maruayle that I here
no tydynges of the englyſſhe army that is on
the ſee / for if they were come as they haue promyſed
me to do / I wolde haue wakened the
frenche men oftener thanne ones or this tyme.
What quod his father / do you truſt and abyde
for the englyſſhmen? they are ſo beſyed in euery
quarter / that they wote nat to whome to entende.
The duke of Lancaſtre our coſyn / lyeth
at Bayon or at Burdeaux / and is retourned
out of Spayne in a ſmall ordre / and hath loſt
his men and tyme / and he hath ſente in to Englande
for to haue mo men of armes and archers / 
and he can nat get to the nombre of .xx.
ſpeares. Alſo the englyſſhe men haue had but
late in playne batayle a great domage in Northumberlande / 
for all their chyualry aboute
Newcaſtell vpon Tyne were ouerthrowen / 
and ſlayne and taken / ſo that as nowe the realme
of Englande is nat in good quyete nor
reſte. Wherfore it is nat for you to truſt at this
tyme on the englyſſhe men / for of them ye ſhall
haue no comforte. Wherfore I coūſayle you to
be ruled by vs / and we ſhall make your peace
with the frenche kyng / & ſhall do ſo moche that
ye ſhall nouther receyue ſhame nor domage.
Syr quod the duke of Guerles / howe may I
with myne honoure acorde with the Frenche
kynge though I ſhulde leſe all my hole lande / 
& go dwell in ſome other place? ſurely I wyll
nat do it / I am to ſore alyed with the kinge of
Englande / and alſo I haue defyed the frenche
kynge. Thynke you that for feare of hym I
ſhulde reuoke my wordes / or breke my ſeale?
ye wolde I ſhulde be dyſhonored? I requyre
you let me alone: I ſhall defende my ſelf right
well agaynſt them: I ſet lytell by their thretenynges.
The waters / and raynes / and colde
wethers ſhall ſo fight for me / or the tyme of Ianyuer
come / that they ſhall be ſo wery / that the
hardyeſt of theym ſhall wyſſhe them ſelfe at
home in their owne houſes.
            THus at the begynnynge of this treatie
the duke of Iuliers and the byſſhoppe
of Coloyne coulde nat breke the duke of Guerles
purpoſe / and yet they were with hym a ſixe
dayes / and euery day in counſayle. And whan
the duke of Iulyers ſawe no otherways / he began
ſore to argue againſt his ſonne and ſayd.
Sonne / if ye wyll nat byleue me ſurely I ſhall
dyſpleaſe you / and as for your enherytaunce
of the duchy of Iulyers / ye ſhall neuer haue
one foote therof / but rather I ſhall gyue it to a
ſtraunger / who ſhall be of puyſſaunce to defende
it agaynſte you. ye are but a foole if ye
wyll nat beleue my counſayle. Whan the duke
of Guerles ſawe his father inflamed with ire / 
than to apeaſe his diſpleaſure ſayd. Sir / than
counſayle me to myne honour / and at your deſyre
I ſhall leane therto / for ſyr Iowe to you
all obeyſaunce and wyll do. Than the duke of
Iulyers ſayde. Sonne / nowe ye ſpeke as ye
ſhulde do / and I ſhall loke for your honoure
aſmoche as I wolde do for myne owne. Than
it was deuyſed by great delyberacion of counſayle / 
that for to ſaue the honoure on all parties / 
that the duke of Guerles ſhulde go to the
frenche kynge and to do hym honoure and reuerence / 
as he ought to do to a Kynge / and to
make his excuſe of the defyaunce that he had
ſente to the kynge / and to ſay after this maner.
Syr / trewe it is there was a letter at a tyme
ſealed with my ſeale ſente in to Fraunce / whiche
came to your knowledge / in the whiche letter
was contaygned defyaunce / pertaynynge
to your grace and to your realme / with wordes
vnreaſonable / out of the ryght ſtyle and
vſage that princes and lordes defie eche other / 
the whiche I wyll nat auowe ye euer any ſuche
wordes paſſed out of my mouthe / nor by my
cōmaundemente / any worde touchynge or defamynge
your name or ſignory: and ſyr / to veryfye
that this myne excuſe is of trouthe / and
that it maye be had out of all ſuſpecte / I ſhall
declare the trouthe of euery thynge. Syr / by
reaſon of the great alyaunce and ſeruyce that
I haue borne to my ryght redouted lorde the
Kynge of Englande / at his requeſte and his
counſayls / I ſente in to Englande four of my
knyghtes / and delyuered theym my ſeale to
ſeale to any thynge that they concluded vpon / 
they ſealed this letter and nat I / for I neuer
knewe before the ſealynge of that letter / what
was conteyned therin. Syr / I requyre your
grace accepte this excuſe for this is trewe. but
ſir / as for the aliaunce and ſeruyce that I haue
made to my lorde the kynge of Englande I
wyll neuer breke it / nor do contrarye to that he
commaundeth me. But ſyr / at his requeſt and
cōmaundement I wyll defye you or any other
whan it ſhall pleaſe hym who ſo euer they be / 

except myne owne naturall lorde the kynge of
Almayne to whome I am made ſeruaunte by
my mouthe ſpoken / and by myne handes in
his. But ſyr for the honoure of you / conſyderynge
and in recompenſynge the paynes and
traueyls that ye haue ſuſteyned in your iourney
comynge hyder / to knowe the foundacion
and trouthe of the defyaunce / I ſhall ſwere to
you and kepe it / that I ſhal neuer make warre
agaynſt you nor defye you / but fyrſte ye ſhall
be ſignyfyed therof an hole yere before. And
ſir / me thynke this ſhulde ſuffyce you. To this
deuyſe the duke of Guerles ſayde / I am well
contente thus to do / in this there in no dyſhonour
nor blame to me / as I thynke.
            THus on this poynte departed the duke
of Iulyers from his ſonne the duke of
Guerles / and with him the archebyſſhoppe of
Coloygne / and ſo they returned in to Iulyers
and came to Endeſker. And whan tyme was
they wente to the frenche kynge / and ſhewed
him all the poyntes and artycles before reherſed / 
and ſayd. Syr / loke what ye wyll do with
the duke of guerles / for other than this ye ſhall
nat haue of hym. The frenche kynge greatly
deſyred to ſe the duke of Guerles his coſyn / by
cauſe he had put hym to ſomoche payne / wherfore
the ſoner he enclyned to this treatye. And
the duke of Burgoyn who wolde alſo that the
duches of Brabant and her countrey ſhulde a
byde in reſt and peace / he toke payne to bringe
this creatie to effecte / and yt the duke of Guerles
myght come to ſpeke with the kynge. And
alſo there was one thynge that made them the
ſoner agre / wynter aproched and the nyghtes
began to be longe and colde / and alſo the lordes
of Fraunce were enfourmed that Guerles
was no countrey to reſt in / in the tyme of wynter.
and alſo dayly they had reporte howe they
loſte of their men / bothe knyghtes and ſquyers
by the ſynſars almayns / who dayly lay in
wayte for them. So many reaſons and conſyderacyons
were layde and alledged that they
fell to acorde / and the duke of Guerles aproched
and the duke of Iulyers his father / & the
duke of Lorayne and the byſſhop of Coloigne
brought hym in to the kynges tente / where
there was with the kynge his thre vncles / and
his brother the duke of Tourayne & the duke
of Bare / the erle of Marche / the erle of ſaynte
Pole / the erle dolphyn of Auuergne / the lorde
Coucy / and the conſtable of Fraunce. There
the duke of Guerles kneled downe before the
kynge / and as it was infourmed me / the kyng
toke hym vp / and there valyauntly and wyſely
he exſcuſed hym ſelfe of the defyaunce that
he had made to the kynge. And moreouer he
ſware / that if euer he wolde defye the kynge or
make warre to the realme of Fraunce / that he
wolde gyue the kynge knowlege therof a yere
before / and the countreys of Guerles and Brabante
to be ſtyll in the ſame caſe / as they be in
at that ſame preſēt tyme. Thus the mater concluded
bytwene them. and the duke of Guerles
ſupped with the kynge the ſame nyghte at
his table / he was greatly regarded / bycauſe
he had put the kynge to ſo moche payne and
coſte. This treatie and concluſyon was put in
writynge and ſealed / and whan all was done
the lordes toke leaue to departe. but or they departed
the duke of Guerles demaunded of the
kynge / that all ſuche priſoners as the Frenche
men had taken in that warre / that he myght
haue them delyuered franke and free. He had
his deſyre / they were delyuered. Thanne the
kynge demaunded of the duke / that all ſuche
pryſoners as his men had taken in that voyage
ſhulde be delyuered and rendred agayne.
Than the duke of Guerles excuſed hym ſelfe / 
and ſayde. Syr that I can not do / I am but a
poore man / and whan I knewe of your commynge
I fortifyed my ſelfe the beſt I myght
with men of warre / knyghtes and ſquyes fro
beyonde the ryuer of Ryne / and other places / 
and I promyſed them that what ſo euer they
wanne in this warre / it ſhulde be their owne.
wherfore I can take nothinge fro them of that
they haue wonne / if I wolde / I haue nouther
puyſſaunce nor power to do it / for if I wolde
ſhewe rygoure to theym / they wolde make
warre agaynſt me. wherfore ſir / may it pleaſe
you to lette it paſſe / for I canne nat remedy it.
The kynge ſawe he coulde haue nothyng els / 
he ſuffred it to paſſe / and imagyned that he
and his realme were riche ynough to encreaſe
poore men / wherfore he let it paſſe / and ſpake
no mo wordes / and at their departure eche of
theym well contented other. Than it was ordeyned
to dyſlodge and to retourne the ſame
way they came / and than it was ſayd that the
frenche kynge ſhulde be at the cytie of Reynes
at the feeſt of all ſayntes / and there to holde a

great feeſt. Thus euery man dyſlodged and
retourned. ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the englyſſhe
army on the ſee.

            ¶Howe the erle of Arundell and the
knyghtes of Englande beyng on the
ſee / by fortune of the wynde came to
the Palyce beſyde Rochell / whoſe beynge
there was ſignifyed to ſir Loys
of Xanſer / and of the departynge of
the erle of Arundell. Cap. C.l.
            
               IN the meane ſeaſone
whyle the french kyng was
in Guerles / the englyſſhe
army was on the ſee / wherof
the erle of Arundell was
chefe capytayne / and ſome
tyme ſayled forwarde / and
ſomtyme bacwarde / as the wynde wolde ſerue
them / to ſeke for aduentures / as it is well knowen.
Always lightly bytwene the feeſt of ſaynt
Remey and all ſayntes / is a peryllous ſeaſon
for ſtormes and wyndes on the ſee / and aboute
the ſame tyme there roſe ſuche a tempeſte / that
it ſperkled abrode the englyſſhe nauy in ſuche
wyſe / that the hardyeſt marynere there was
ſore abaſſhed / ſo that perforce they were conſtreyned
to ſeke for lande. And the erle of Arundell
with .xxvii. veſſelles with hym / whether
they wolde or nat / were fayne to caſte ancre in
a lytell hauen called the Palyce / a two ſmall
leages fro Rochell / and ye wynde was ſo ſtreynable
on ſee borde / that they coude nat departe
thence. Whanne tydynges therof came to Rochell / 
they were in great dought at the fyrſte / 
leſte the engliſſhmen wolde come on them and
do them great domage / and cloſed their gates
and helde them ſhytte a day and a halfe. Than
other tydynges came to them fro them of Palyce / 
howe the englyſſhemen were but .xxvii.
veſſelles / and came thyder by force of wynde
and wether / and taryed for nothynge but to de
parte agayne / and that the Erle of Arundell
was there / and the lorde Henry Beamonde / 
ſir Willyam Helmen / & mo than thyrty knyghtes
of Englande. Than they of Rochell tooke
counſayle what thynge was beſte for them to
do / and all thyng conſydered / they ſayd howe
they ſhulde but eaſly acquyte themſelfe / if they
went nat to ſkrymyſſhe with them. The ſame
ſeaſon before the caſtell of Bouteuyll / was ſyr
Loys of Xanſere merſhall of Fraūce / and had
beſieged within the fortreſſe Gylliam of ſaynt
Foye a gaſcon / and with the marſhall a great
company of Poicto
                  •
                / of Xayntone / of Piergourt / 
of Rochell / and of the lowe marches / for
all were nat gone in to Almayne with ye knig.
This ſir Loys was ſoueraygne capytayne ouer
all the fronters / bytwene Mountpellyer
and Rochell / tyll the retourne of the lorde Coucy.
They of Rochell ſent worde to the marſhall
of the englyſſhmens beynge at Palyce. Whan
he herde therof he was ryght ioyfull / and ſent
to theym that they ſhulde make redy ſeuen or
eyght galees / and to man them forthe / for he
wolde come by lande and fyght with the Engliſſhmen.
They of Rochell dyd as they were
commaunded / and ſir Loys departed fro his
ſiege / and brake it vp / for he thought it ſhulde
be more honorable for hym to fyght with the
erle of Arundell and the englyſſhe men / rather
thanne to contyne we ſtyll his ſiege. Thus be
wente to Rochell / and all knyghtes and ſquyers
folowed hym. I can nat tell by what inſpyracyon
the erle of Arundell had knowledge / 
howe the marſhall of Fraunce with a greate
puyſſaunce of knyghtes and ſquyers was comynge
to fyght with hym at Palyce / whiche
tydynges were nat very pleaſaunte to the erle
of Arundell / howe be it the wynde was ſome
what layde / and the ſee aueyled. Than the erle
wayed vp ancres and ſayled in to the ſee / in
ſuche good ſeaſon / that if he had taryed longe
after / he had been encloſed in the hauen and
euery man taken / for in contynent thyder came
the galees of Rochell / well manned and furnyſſhed
with artyllery and gonnes / and came
ſtreyght to the hauen of the Palyce / and foūde
the engliſſhe men departed. They purſued after
a two leages in the ſee and ſhotte gonnes / 
howebeit they durſt nat longe folowe for feare
of enbuſſhmentes on the ſee. Than the frenche
ſhippes returned / and the marſhall of Fraunce
was ſore dyſpleaſed with theym of Rochell / 
that they ſente hym worde ſo late. The erle of
Arundell toke the waye by the ryuer of Garon / 
to come to Burdeaux / and therby ye ſiege
before Bowteuyll was defeated / for Gillonet

of ſaynt Foy prouyded his garyſon of that he
neded / in the meane tyme ye the marſhall went
to fyght with the englyſſhe men.
            NOwe let vs retourne ſomwhat to ſpeke
of the duke of Lancaſtre / howe he was
in treatie with the ſpanyardes / and alſo with
the Duke of Berrey / for the maryage of his
doughter. The kynge of Caſtyle treated with
hym for his ſonne the prince of Caſtyle / to the
entent to haue a peace with the engliſſhe men.
Alſo the duke of Berrey treated to haue the duke
of Lancaſters doughter for hymſelfe / for he
had great deſyre to be maryed. And the duke
of Lancaſtre lyke a ſage imagynat
                  ••
               e prince / 
ſawe well howe it was more profitable for Englande
and for hym / to mary his doughter in
to Caſtyle / rather than to the duke of Berrey / 
for therby he / thought to recouer the herytage
of Caſtyle in tyme to come / for his doughter.
And if he ſhulde gyue her to the duke of Berrey / 
and the duke fortune to dye / his doughter
than ſhulde be but a poore lady / to the regarde
of other / bycauſe the duke of Berrey had chyldren
by his fyrſt wyfe / who ſhulde haue all the
profyte. Alſo the ducheſſe of Lancaſtre enclyned
to the kynge of Caſtyles ſonne. So that
whan ſir Helyon of Lignac was departed fro
the duke of Lancaſtre / and retourned to the
duke of Berrey / beynge as that in Almayne / 
than the king of Caſtyls meſſāgers were well
herde / in ſuche wyſe / that their wordes were
noted and their offers accepted / and the couenaunte
made and ſworne bytwene Kateryn of
Lancaſtre and the kynge of Caſtylles ſonne / 
and writynges and publike inſtrumentes and
oblygatory bondes made and concluded / with
out re
                  •
               le or repentaunce. So yt the duches of
Lācaſtre after euery thyng ſet in ordre / ſhulde
bring her doughter Kateryn in to Caſtyle.
            All this ſeaſon the frenche kynge was ſtyll in
the fronters of Iulyers / concludynge with the
duke of Guerles (as ye haue herde before) and
howe they departed. And as the frenche men
retourned / it fortuned on the fronteres of Almayne
on a nyght aboute mydnyght / as the
mone / 
                  •
               hone fayre / certayne almayns robbers
and pyllers / that dyd ſette nother by peace nor
warre / but alwayes ſought for their aduauntage / 
ſome pertaynynge to the lorde of Blaqueneuen / 
and to ſir Peter of Conebech / they
were well horſed / and came and aduyſed the
french hooſt / and where they might haue moſt
profyte and aduauntage / and ſo paſſed by the
lodgyng of the vycount of Meaulx / and ſawe
no ſtyringe / and returned without any noyſe
makynge / outher paſſynge or retournynge / 
and came agayne to their enbuſſhe / and ſhewed
them what they had ſene and founde
                  •
                and
incontynente theſe almayns came and entred
at their aduauntage in to the frenchmens lodgynges / 
and ouerthrewe I can nat tell howe
many / and toke .xiiii. menne of armes priſoners.
There was taken the lorde of Vieſuile / 
and the lorde of Mountkarell. This aduenture
the frenche men hadde the ſame nyght / by
reaſon they made but eaſy watche / and were
but yuell ordred. The next day whan theſe tydinges
were knowen / howe the lorde of Vieſuille / 
and the lorde of Mountkarell were taken / 
the frenche men were ſore diſpleaſed / and
toke better hede after. Whan the frenche kynge
departed fro the countrey of Iulyers none taryed
behynde / euery man drewe to their garyſons / 
ſir Guylliam of Tremoyle and ſir Geruays
Furrande / and all other / and the braban
ſoys by the waye euery man wente home. And
in the retournynge of the frenche men / it was
ordeyned by great delyberacion of coūſayle / 
that the frenche kynge (who had ben vnder the
gouernynge of his vncles / euer ſyth the dethe
of the laſte kynge his father) ſhulde than take
on himſelfe the gouernynge and charge of his
hole realme / and his vncles to ceaſe of the gouernynge / 
for they had ynough to do in other
buſyneſſes. The kynge as thanne was paſte
twenty yere of age. This was openly publyſſhed / 
and euery man thought it was reſonable.
The kynge came to Rennes at the feeſt of
all ſayntes / and there helde a great feeſt / and
his vncles with hym. And there they had fyrſt
knowledge that the Kynge of Caſtyle / and the
duke of Lācaſtre were cōcluded vpon a peace
and vpon a maryage to be had / bytwene the
kinges ſonne and the dukes doughter. Than
the frenche kyng ſported with the duke of Berrey / 
and ſayde. Fayre vncle ye haue fayled of
your entent / a nother is lyke to enioy the wyfe
that ye wolde haue had / howe ſay you therto / 
what ſayeth your corage? The duke of Berrey
ſayde. Syr I ſaye nothynge but well / if
I haue fayled there / I ſhall ſpede in ſome other
place. Than the frenche men beganne to

murmure vpon this maryage / and ſaid. this
can nat be done without great alyaūces / whiche
ſhalbe a thynge greatly preiudycyall in
tyme to come to the realme of Fraūce. And ſuche
as conſidred the botom of the mater ſaid:
howe that if Caſtyle / Englande / and Portugale
be all of one alyaunce and accorde / theſe
thre realmes / what by ſee and by lande / they
maye make warre to the realme of Fraunce.
Wherfore they ſayde / it were good that the
kynge ſhulde ſende and prouyde remedy by
tymes / conſydringe that this vnhappy kyng
of Caſtyle hath made alyaūce in maner with
a deed man: For the duke of lancaſtre is as a
man without men and puyſſaunce. Nor alſo
they ſayde / howe the kyng of Caſtyll ought
nat to make any aliaūce with any man / with
out the counſayle of the Frenche kynge. If
he do / the kynge maye ſende hym worde that
he wyll make hym as lowe a varlette / as he
hath made hym a great lorde. Lette the kynge
make warre agaynſte the realme of Caſtyle
and putte out the vnhappy kyng / ſonne
to a baſtarde / and lette the kyng gyue the realme
to his owne brother the duke of Thourayne / 
who as yet hath no great herytage: he
ſhall well and ſagely gouerne it. Howe can
or dare this kynge of Caſtyle make or treate
for any peace or alyaunce with the duke of
Lancaſtre / without the knowledge or cōſent
of the Frenche kynge / who hath ſo moche ayded / 
honoured / and auaunſed hym? He had
loſte his realme / if the puiſſaunce and blode
royall of Fraunce had nat ben: He hath well
marchaundyſed / and yet he wyll marchaundyſe.
But if it be (as it is ſayd) lette hym be
ſhamed and diſheryted / and lette hym haue
ſuche punyſſhment / that he may well knowe
that he hath yuell done.
            
               THeſe wordes multiplyed / in ſuche
wyſe / that all thynges conſydered / 
The kynge and his vncles / and his
counſayle / determyned to ſende in to Caſtyle
to kynge Iohan / and to ſhewe hym on
the Frenche kynges behalfe / that he be well
aduyſed and take hede what he dothe: And
that he be nat ſo hardy to make any treatie or
alyaunce with the Englyſſhe men / nor with
the duke of Lancaſtre / in any thyng yt ſhulde
be preiudyciall to the Crowne or realme of
Fraunce. And if he haue done / or do / or thynketh
to do: Lette hym be ſure that the puyſſaunce
of Fraunce ſhall / as moche or more
ſette hym a backe and hynder hym / as it hath
auaunſed hym before: And that the kynge
and the realme ſhall entende to do nothynge
elles / but to diſtroye hym. Than it was conſydred / 
who ſhulde do this meſſage. And it
was thought that who ſoeuer ſhulde do it / 
ought to be a hardy man & well ſpoken / and
ſagely and valiauntly to declare the kynges
pleaſure. It was thought that a meane and
a ſymple perſone ought nat to do that meſſage.
Than there were thre perſones named
the lorde of Coucy / ſir Iohan of Vyen admyrall
of Fraunce / & ſir Guye de la Tremoyle.
Of theſe thre to take one to go in to Caſtyle
on this voyage. And all thynges conſydred / 
ſir Iohan of Vyenne was apoynted to go.
Than the kynge and his counſayle ſayd vnto
hym. Admyrall make you redy / ye ſhall
go on this voyage / and ye ſhall haue none other
letters to the kyng of Caſtyle but of credence / 
ye are ſuffyciētly enſtructed of the mater
whervpon ye be ſente. And ſaye vnto the
kynge of Spaygne / that he aduyſe well and
cauſe to be aduyſed: And to rede and cauſe to
be reed / the alyaunces / ordynaunces / and ꝓmyſes / 
ſworne and ſealed bytwene hym and
vs: and marke well youre aunſwere that ye
ſhall haue of hym and of his counſayle / and
thervpon we ſhall take our grounde to procede
farther. The admyrall aunſwered and
ſayd / it ſhalbe done.

            ¶Howe the Admyrall of Fraunce
was ordayned by the Frenche kyng
and his counſayle as ambaſſadour / 
to go to the kynge of Caſtyle. And
howe the Duke of Berrey ſente to
the erle of Foize to treate for a maryage / 
bytwene the duke of Berrey &
the erles doughter of Boulonge.

               THe admyrall of Fraūce
taryed nat long at Paris / 
but made hym quickely redye
to departe / and tooke
his leaue of the kyng and
of his vncles / and tooke
his waye by Burgoyne / 
bycauſe he wolde go by Auygnone to ſe the
pope and his brother / and ſo he dyde.
            ¶Nowe lette vs leaue ſpekyng of hym / and
ſpeke ſomwhat of Geffray. Tete noyre / who
was encloſed and beſieged within the caſtell
of Vandachore. But fyrſte we wyll ſpeke of
the duke of Berrey who had great deſyre to
mary / as he well ſhewed within that yere.
Whan he ſawe that he had fayled of the duke
of Lancaſters doughter. he was enfourmed
that the erle of Boulonge had a fayre doughter
named Iane / doughter to the lady Elyanour
of Comynges / howe be it ſhe was nat
with her father nor with her moder / ſhe was
in the countrey of Bierne with the Erle of
Foiz her great frende and coſyn. She hadde
ben there brought vp and nouryſſhed & well
entreated the ſpace of nyne yeres / in the caſtell
of Ortayes / without coſt or charge to father
or mother. The erle often tymes hadde
been deſyred to haue had her maryed: but alwayes
the erle aunſwered that the damoſell
was to yonge. Specially ſir Bernarde brother
to the erle of Armynacke hadde deſyred
to haue her / and promyſed that if he myght
haue her in maryage / the warre ſhulde ende
bytwene them / for the chalenge of the lande
of Byerne. But for all thoſe promyſes / the
erle wolde nat agree therto / but aunſwered
euer / howe that his coſyn was to yonge. but
amonge his owne men he wolde ſaye otherwyſe.
For as ſir Eſpaygne du Lyon ſhewed
me / he wolde ſaye / howe they of Armynacke
myght well repute hym for a beeſt / if he ſhulde
graunt their deſyre / ſeynge it was to his
dōmage. For if he ſhulde graunt theym his
coſyn in maryage / he ſhulde ſtrength them / 
and enfeble hym ſelfe. Sayeng / howe they
of Armynake helde by force and nat of right
the countie of Comynges / the whiche herytage
is by his mother and aunte to my coſyn
of Boloyne. I wyll well they knowe I ſhall
mary her in ſo ſtronge a place and puiſſaunt
to make warre with them for the herytage of
Comynges. For as nowe there is none to anſwere
but a deed man.
            THus whan the erle of Armynacke &
ſir Bernarde his brother / ſawe that
they coulde nat come to their purpoſe / 
as long as her aunte lyued. Than they
ſayde to the duke of Berrey / that this lady
ſhulde be a fayre maryage for Iohn̄ of Berrey
his ſonne. And by their ſettynge on / the
duke ſente ſuffycient and noble meſſangers
in to Byerne to the erle of Foiz. Deſyringe
hym that all yuell wyll might be ſette aparte
and euery thynge pardoned of tymes paſte / 
and that he myght haue the damoſell of Boulonge / 
for Iohan his ſonne in maryage. So
that the erle of Boulonge / father to the damoſell
dyde therto agree and aſſent. Therle
of Foiz made good chere to theſe ābaſſadors
but he excuſed hym for that maryage / & ſayd
howe the lady his coſyn was to yonge: And
alſo he ſayde / howe that whan the counteſſe
of Boulonge her mother delyuered her in to
his charge / She cauſed hym to ſwere / that
he ſhulde neuer mary her in no place / withher
knowledge and conſent. And in no wyſe
he ſayde he myght / nor wolde nat breake his
promyſe nor othe / and he ſayd none ought to
deſyre hym thervnto. This excuſe the Erle
made / for he knewe well that his coſyn of Comynges / 
who was with the erle of Vrgell
her brother in the realme of Arragon / wolde
nat agree thervnto. Thus the ambaſſadors
of the duke of Berrey retourned without any
thyng doyng to their purpoſe. And whan
they were gone (as ſir Eſpaygne du Lyon
ſhewed me) the erle ſayde ah. The duke of
Berrey and his coūſayle myght well repute
me for an ignorant / whan he wolde haue me
to enforce myne ennemyes. Iohan of Berry
is coſyn germayn to myne aduerſaries of Armynake.
that bargayne ſhall I neuer make / 
I ſhall rather mary her in to Englande. It
hath been ſpoken of to ſir Henry of Lancaſtre
erle of Derby / ſonne to the duke of Lancaſtre.
If I thought nat greatly to diſpleaſe
the Frenche kynge / there ſhulde none other
haue her but he. & as yet I knowe nat what
I wyll do / for I ſhall rather mary her at my
pleaſure / than they of Armynake ſhulde haue
her agaynſte my wyll. In me it lyeth to
do or to leaue. I nede nat to trouble my ſelfe
in the mater.
            
               
Whan the duke of Berrey knewe the certē
               lie
that the duke of Lācaſtre ſhulde mary his
doughter to ye king of Caſtyls ſon̄e / & that he
coude nat breke that maryage in no wyſe: he
was a .v. or ſixe dayes ſo penſyue / that none
about hym durſt demaūde what he ayled: at
laſt he declared his entent to thē of his counſaile.
than they ſaid to hym. ſir / if ye haue fayled
of the duke of Lancaſters doughter / ye
maye recouer another / as great and as good
(as ſhe is) howe be it ſhe is very yonge for
your age. Wherfore we can nat tell if the erle
of Foiz wyll refuce it for that cauſe / who hath
the lady in his gouernaunce. Ah quod the duke / 
that is the doughter of the Erle of Boulonge / 
the erle of Foiz hath refuſed Iohan of
Berrey / howe be it in the name of god let vs
yet aſſaye. Than the duke wrote to the Erle
of Foiz / ſignifyeng hym ryght ſwetely that
he wolde ſende to hym four lordes: as therle
of Xancere / the lorde de la Ryuer / ſir Guy de
la Tremoyle / and the Vycount Daſſey / to
treate with hym to haue for hym ſelfe in maryage
the doughter of Boulonge / beyng vnder
his kepyng / ſo it maye be to his pleaſure.
and deſyred the erle to ſende hym an anſwere
in writyng the hole of his mynde / to thentent
that his meſſangers ſhulde nat traueyle in
vayne / nor leſe there payne. The erle of Foiz
receyued the meſſāgers that brought the writtynge
ryght amyably / and wrote agayne by
them to the duke of Berrey: ſayeng / howe he
was right gladde of thoſe tidynges / & wolde
be redy to receyue the ſayd lordes / outher in
Foiz or in Byerne / ſo that the Erle of Boulonge
and the coūteſſe / father and mother to
the lady be agreed thervnto. And at their retourne
whan the duke of Berey herde his anſwere
he was right ioyfull / and all that wynter
ſtyll he purſued / what here & there / that he
myght attayne to this maryage the nexte ſomer
after. He coude nat bring his purpoſe aboute
ſhortely / for he knewe well the erle of
Foiz was no man lightly to be wonne / for he
was ſure he ſhulde haue many delays. wherfore
the duke thought to worke wyſely / & ſent
ſpecyall meſſangers to pope Clement / who
was coſyn and nere a kyn to the damoſell of
Boulōge. The pope was right ioyouſe whā
he knewe yt his coſyn might to highly be maryed / 
as to the duke of Berrey / vncle to the
Frēche kyng. Than the pope wrote to therle
of Foiz / ſignifyeng hym right honorably / &
aduyſinge hym that he ſhulde nat vary fro ye
treatie of that maryage / for therby their lynage
ſhulde be enhaunſed. Thus the erle of
Foiz receyued letters fro all parties & he anſwered
them all / for right well he coude diſſimule
in ſuche buſyneſſe. He helde all the parties
in good loue and fauour / bothe the pope
and ye duke of Berrey. yet there was nat the
wyſeſt of thē bothe nor of their counfayls / yt
coude knowe perfitely what the erle of Foiz
thought ſurely to do. ¶Nowe lette vs ſomwhat
leaue ſpeakyng of this mater / and retourne
to the ſiege of Vanchadore.
            ye haue herde here before in this hyſtorie / 
how ſir Wyllm̄ Lignac and ſir Iohn̄ Boemlaunce / 
& dyuers other knightes and ſquiers
of Auuergne and Limoſin had beſieged ye caſtell
of Vāchadore / and Geffray Tete noyre
within: But they coude nat wyn it by no maner
of aſſaut / for they within were prouyded
of all thynges neceſſary for .vii. yere / though
they had no refreſſhyng. They without ofte
tymes wolde come out of their baſtydes and
ſcrimyſſhe. Durynge the ſiege many feates
of armes were done / & dyuers hurt on bothe
ꝑtes. And ſo it fortuned at a ſcrimyſſhe Geffray
Tete noyre was there hym ſelfe / & auaū
               ſed
ſo forwarde / that he was ſtriken through
the baſſenet in to the heed with a quarell / ſo
that he was fayne to kepe his bedde / wherwt
all his company was ſore diſpleaſed / and the
ſeaſon that he lay there was no ſcrimyſſhīg.
of this hurt if he had ben well kept he might
ſone haue ben hole / but he kept hym ſelfe but
yuell and ſpecially fro lechery / the whiche he
derely bought / for it coſt hym his lyfe: but or
he died he knewe well before there was no remedy
but dethe / For it was playnly ſhewed
hym / by reaſon of his yuell rule. He was in
ieoꝑdy of dethe for his hed apoſtumed / wherfore
he was counſayled to declare his wyll &
to make hym redy to god ward: thā he made
his teſtament. Firſt he cauſed to come before
hym all the ſoueraygne companyons of the
garyſon / ſuche as were beſt expert in armes.
Than he ſate vp in his bedde and ſayd. ſirs / 
and derely beloued companyons / I knowe
well I am in great daunger of dethe: we haue
a long ſeaſon ben toguyder / & kepte good
company: I haue ben your maiſter and true

capitayne to my power. Wherfore I wolde
gladly in my lyfe dayes ſe that ye hadde another
capitayne / that trewly ſhulde acquyte
hym to you all / and to kepe this fortreſſe. for
I ſhall leaue it well prouyded of euery thynge
neceſſary parteyning to a caſtell of warre
bothe of wyne / vitaylles / and artyllary / and
other thynges requyſyte. Wherfore I demaunde
of you all in generall / if ye be aduyſed
of any capitayne or capitayns metely to
be choſen to gouerne you and this caſtell / as
men of warre aduenturers ought to do / for
ſuche hath ben alwayes the warre that I haue
vſed. I haue made warre moche vnder
the ſhadowe of the kyng of Englandes quarell.
I haue alwayes be deſyrous to be there
as ſomwhat was to be gotton / & ſo alwayes
companyons aduēturers ought to do / ſuche
as deſyre feates of armes to aduenture them
ſelfe. Here in theſe fronters is a good countrey
and frutefull / and great profyte to be goton
therin / thoughe the Frenche men nowe
beſiege vs / it wyll nat endure alwayes: the
ſiege and their baſtydes wyll breke one day.
Sirs / anſwere me to my demaunde. Haue
ye choſen any capitayne amonge you? The
companyons ſtode ſtyll and gaue none aunſwere.
and whan he ſawe that they ſpake nat
he beganne to ſpeke agayne with ſwete wordes
and ſayd. Sirs / I thynke ſurely of this
my demaunde ye haue thought before but lytell.
Wherfore ſirs / as I haue layne here in

There all the companyons made theym

            Thus Geffray Teate Noyre made his teſtament

and was buryed in ye chapell of ſaint George
within the caſtell. His wyll was accomplyſſhed / 
and the .xxx. thouſande frankes deuyded

dethe of Geffray Teate noyre was knowen
in Auuergne and Lymoſyn / the knyghtes &
ſquyers there were ryght ioyfull therof / and
douted leſſe than they dyde before. For this
Geffray in his tyme was ſore douted / for he
was a good and a ſage capitayne and expert
in all warre.
            NOwe lette vs retourne to the duke
of Guerles and ſhewe what fell to
hym in this ſeaſon / bycauſe I haue
ſpoken of hym before: For by his meanes the
Frenche kyng / his vncles / and his brother / &
other nobles of Fraunce came to the entre of
the countrey of Guerles: and the kyng deꝑted
thens and the duke / hauyng no great domage.
And whan the duke of Guerles ſawe
that all the mē of warre were departed / and
that he was apeaſed with the duches of Brabant
and with all his enemyes / by reaſon of
the compoſicion that was made / as to rendre
vp the towne of Graue vpon certayne poyntes
and artycles / ordayned bytwene ye duke
of Burgone / the duches of Brabant / and the
duke of Guerles. Than he thought (to then
tent to employ his ſeaſon) to go in to Pruce / 
He made hym redy / and gate hym company
of knyghtes and ſquyers of his owne countrey / 
and other places. And about the vtas of
ſaynt Martyn he rode forthe throughe Almaygne / 
and in euery place where as he paſſed
he had good chere. And ſo longe he rode
that he came to the lande of Pruce / I knowe
nat by what inſydence. Certayne men layde
in wayte on hym / and in the feldes ſet on him
or he was ware / and ouerthewe hym and all
his men / ſo that they loſt all their horſes / armure / 
veſſell / golde and ſyluer / and were all
ledde priſoners to a towne / and there ſware
faythe and trouthe to paye their ran̄ſomes / 
and ſpecially ye duke of Guerles became priſoner
and made promyſe to pay his ran̄ſome
to a ſquyer called Arnolde / his ſurname I
knowe nat. Than ye duke and his men were
ledde to a ſtronge towne in the lande of the
duke of Stulpe / whether ye duke was there
or nat I was nat enformed therof. but whan
the great mayſters of Pruce herde howe the
duke of Guerles was taken as he was commyng
in to their countre / they were ſore diſpleaſed
therwith / and ſayd: howe the mater
ſhulde nat reſt in that caſe / for they to ſuffr
                  •
               
it ſhulde be greatly to their blame. Tha
                  ••
               
they reyſed vp men and departed fro Cōnyſbredge / 
and came with a great ſtrength of
men towardes the towne and caſtell / where
as the duke of Guerles was in priſon. Whan
the ſquyer that had taken the duke was enfourmed
of the cōmyng of the great mayſter
of Pruce with ſuche a puyſſaunce doughted
greatly / and determyned nat to abyde their
cōmyng to the caſtell / but thought to departe
But or his departure he came to the duke of
Guerles and ſayd to hym. Sir duke / ye are
my priſoner and I am your mayſter. ye are
a gētylman and a true knight: ye haue ſworne
and gyuen me your faithe where ſoeuer I
go and wyll go / ye ought to folowe me: I
can nat tell if ye haue ſente for the great mayſter
of Pruce or nat / he cometh hyder with a
great puyſſaūce: I thynke nat to abyde hym
tary you here if ye lyſt / I wyll cary with me
your faythe and promyſe. The duke to thoſe
wordes gaue none anſwere: and the ſquyer
toke his horſe and departed / and wente to a
place ſtronge ynoughe: And at his deꝑtyng
he ſayde agayne to the duke. Sir / ye ſhall
fynde me in ſuche a place / he named hym a
ſtronge caſtell and oute of all hyghe wayes.
And whan he was gone the great mayſter of
Pruce came to the duke of Guerles where
as he was / for there was none to lette hym / 
and ſo delyuered the duke out of priſon: and
if he hadde founde the ſquyer there / ſurely he
had been ſlayne. Than the great mayſter of
Pruce retourned to Connyſbredge / and the
duke of Guerles with hym.
            
               
I Shall ſhewe you what fell of this
buſyneſſe. True it was / great brute
ran in dyuers countreis / and ſpecially
in Almaygne of the takyng of the duke
of Guerles / euery man that herde it hadde
great marueile therof. Thus whan the duke
of Guerles was come to Conniſbredge and
was delyuered / as ye haue herde: than he remembred
hymſelfe / howe he was bounde by
his faythe to the ſquyer that tooke hym / and
remembred the wordes that the ſquier ſpake
at his deꝑtyng. than he thought in hym ſelfe
that in no wyſe he wolde breke his promyſe / 
but truely acquyte his faythe / and ſayd to the
great maiſter of Pruce / that he wolde no lengar
tary there / but go to the ſquyer that had
his faythe. And ſo determyned to do for any
thynge that the great mayſter coulde ſaye or
do: Nouther diſpenſacyon / abſolucyon / nor
other thyng / coude nat cauſe the duke to abſteyne / 
but that he wolde nedes go to ye town
where as the ſquyer was / whōe he called his
maiſter: euery man that herde therof / reputed
it for a great valyauntneſſe. Whan this
came to knowledge of his frendes and kynſmen / 
than they treated for his delyueraunce.
and ſo he was delyuered by the helpe & meanes
of the duke of Stulpe / who toke great
payne in the mater: Howe be it the duke of
Stulpe or he cōſented that the duke of guerles
ſhulde be delyuered out of daunger / and
out of his lande / wolde in any wyſe that the
duke of Guerles ſhulde ſwere and ſcale / that
he and his heyres neuer after that daye / nor
none other man for hym / ſhulde take any vē
               geaunce
for that mater / by waye of diſſymulacion
or otherwyſe. Thus he was fayne to
do or he departed. This aduenture had the
duke of Guerles that yere. ¶Nowe let vs

Fraunce / and ſhewe what he dyde and what
he ſayd to the kyng of Caſtyle / on the Frēche

            ¶Howe ſir Iohan of Vyen dyd his
meſſage to kynge Iohan of Caſtyle / 
fro the Frenche kynge and his counſayle / 
and what anſwere the kynge
of Caſtyle made. Cap. C.liii.
            
               THe admyrall of Fraūce
ſpedde ſo in his iourneys / 
that he entred into caſtyle / 
and demaunded where to
fynde the Kynge. It was
ſhewed hym howe he was
at Burgus / he rode thyder / 
and alyghted at his lodgynge and refreſſhed
hym / and than made hym redy to go
to the kynges palays: and he was receyued
after the maner of the countrey right honorably / 
for the loue and honoure of the Frenche
kyng. And he was brought in to the kynges
chambre / & there the kyng receyued hym ioyfully.
Than he delyuered the kynge his letters.
The kyng reed them and called his coū
               ſayle
a parte / and whan they ꝑceyued by his
letters that he had credence / than the admyrall
was called forthe / and was cōmaunded
to declare the entent of his cōmynge. And he
who was redy ſayd in fayre language. Sir
kyng and all ye of his coūſayle. The frenche
kyng hath ſente me to you / bycauſe it is come
to his knowledge / howe ye ſhall marry your
ſonne to the duke of Lancaſters doughter. &
ſir / ye knowe well that he is ye kyng my mayſters
aduerſary. The kyng and his coūſayle
haue great marueyle howe ye may here or entende
to any treatie in all the worlde for any
maryage without their knowledge. for they
ſaye and true it is / that maryage of chyldren
can nat be withoute alyaunce / and amyte of
peace and loue. Sir / he ſendeth you worde
by me / that ye be well aduyſed what ye haue
done / or are mynded to do. And yt in no wyſe
it be preiudiciall to the kyng nor to ye realme
of Fraunce / nor therby to breke the boundes
and alyaunces that hath ben ſworne and ſealed
bytwene kyng Henry your father / ye prelates
and noble cyties of this your realme / 
and the noble kyng and realme of Fraunce.
Regarde well that they in no wiſe be broken
for if they be and ones openly knowen / ye
ryn in the churches ſentence / and to be excommunycate
on payne vnpardonable: And alſo
to be in the indygnacion of the kynge and
of all the nobles of Fraunce / and beſyde that
to haue them your great enemyes. Sir / this
is the cōmaundement of the kyng & his counſayle / 
that I haue to ſhewe to you.
            Whan ye kyng of Caſtyle & parte of his coū
               ſayle / 

ſuche as were there had herde the frēch
kynges ambaſſadour ſpeke ſo quickely / they
were abaſſhed / and eche of them loked on other:
there was none that gaue any anſwere / 
but ſatte ſtyll. At the laſte a buſſhoppe ſpake
and ſayde. Sir Iohan / ye are newly come in
to theſe partes / and the kyng and all we ſaye
howe ye be right hertely welcome. The kyng
hath well herde and vnderſtāde what ye haue
ſayd / ye ſhall haue ſhortely and aunſwere / within
a day or two / ſuche as ſhall cōtente you. that
is ſuffycient quod ſir Iohan of Vyen / and ſo
tooke his leaue of the kynge and of his counſayle / 
and wente to his lodgynge. And it was
ſhewed me howe he taryed there more than ſeuen
dayes / without hauynge of any anſwere / 
he ſawe nothynge but dyſſymulacion / wherwith
he was ſore dyſpleaſed / for all that tyme
he coulde nat ſe the kyng / for he kept hym cloſe
in his chambre. And whan ſyr Iohan of Vien
ſawe that he coulde haue none other exployte
in his buſynes / he ſpake on a daye to ſome of
the kynges counſayle / and ſayd. Syrs / ſurely
I wyll departe without aunſwere. They douted
leſte he wolde do as he ſayd / and ſurely ſo
he had done / and they had nat called hym on a
day / and made him his aunſwere as they dyd.
Than it was ſayd to hym howe he might well
ſhewe the frenche kynge / and ſuche as had ſent
hym thyder / that they ſhulde haue the kinge of
Caſtyle nor his counſayle in no maner of ſuſpecte / 
for they had nat done nor wolde nat do
any thynge with the kynge of Englande / that
ſhulde breke or adnychilate in any maner of
wayes / the alyaunces that hath been ſworne
and ſealed bytwene Fraunce & Caſtyle / howe
be it thoughe the kynge of Caſtyle mary his
ſonne to the doughter of the duke of Lācaſtre / 
therby to make a fynall peace / for the chalenge
that the duke maketh to the realme of Caſtyle
by ryght of his wyfe / and generally all the realme
counſayleth the kynge there to / & though
he aſſent & wyll do it / yet the frenche kyng nor
his counſayle ought nat to be dyſpleaſed there
with / for alwayes the kyng of Caſtyle and his
men wyll be conioyned & alyed with the french
kynge / and with the realme of Fraunce. This
was the ſubſtaunce of the anſwere that ſir Iohan
of Vien brought in to Fraūce fro the knig
of Caſtyle / who proceded ſorthe with the duke
of Lancaſtre in his maryage / & made an amyable
peace togyther / by meanes of meſſengers
that wente bytwene them / for the duke laye in
the marcheſſe of Burdeaulx and came thyder
fro Bayon / and the duches and her doughter / 
where as they were receyued with great ioye / 
for they were greatly deſyred there. And fro
Burdeaux they wente to Lyborne.
            WHan trewe and certayne tydynges
was come into the erle of Foiz houſe
howe the Kynge of Caſtyle was agreed
with the duke of Lancaſtre / and ſhulde
mary his ſonne with the dukes doughter / and
to gyue great landes in Caſtyle / and greate
nombre of floreyns / about a two hundred thouſande
nobles / wherof the erle had great marueyle.
This I knowe well / for I ſyr Iohan
Froyſart was there the ſame tyme. Than the
erle of Foiz ſayd. Ah / this kynge of Caſtyle is
vnhappy / for he hath made peace with a deed
man / for I knowe well the duke of Lancaſtre
is in that caſe / and in ſuche daunger / that he
can nat helpe hym ſelfe. But the kynge of Caſtyle
hathe mette with a ſage and a valyaunte
prince of the duke of Lancaſtre / for he hath valyauntly
borne hym ſelfe all the warre ſeaſon.
            NOwe lette vs ſomwhat ſpeke of the army
on the ſee. So it was that aboute
the feeſt of Cryſtmas / the erle of Arundell who
had ben a longe ſeaſon on the ſee / coſtynge the
fronters of Bretaygne / and of Rochell / Xaynton / 
and of Normandy / and ſo paſſed before
Karenten / but a fore that they tooke lande at
Chirbroke / and wolde haue done there ſome
dedes of armes. And ye ſame ſeaſon there were
ſouerayne capytayns in the towne and garyſon
of Karentyne / the lorde of Hambre and the
lorde of Coucy / and with them a great nombre
of knyghtes and ſquyers of Normādy. Whan
the erle of Arundell knewe howe the towne of
Karentyne was ſo well prouyded and furnyſſhed
with good men of warre / than he paſſed
forthe / for he ſawe well in aſſautinge therof he
myght rather leſe than wyn. Than he came to
a nother towne therby / called Toraguy / and
aſſayled it / and toke it perforce / and pylled it / 
and wanne there great rycheſſe / and toke with
theym many priſoners / and than came before
the good towne of Bayeux / and came to the
barryers / and there they made a ſkrymyſſhe
and none aſſaute. Than the englyſſhmen paſſed
the watches of ſaynte Clemente / and dyd

great domage in the countrey / for they taryed
there a fyftene dayes / and no man encountred
them. the marſhall of Blann
                  •
               uille was in Normandy / 
but he knewe nat of their comynge / if
he had he wolde haue prouyded for the mater.
And whan the englyſſhe men had done their
enterpriſe / and done great domage to the countrey
of Normandy / aſmoche as a hūdred thouſande
frankes came vnto. Than they drewe
backe and paſſed agayne the watches / and retourned
to Chyrbroke / and dyd put all their
conqueſt in ſuretye and ſauegarde in to their
ſhyppes. And whan they had wynde & wether / 
and their ſhyppes charged / than they entred
and dyſancred and toke the ſee / and retourned
in to Englande / & aryued at Hampton. Thus
the army of the erle of Arundell on the ſee concluded
in that ſeaſon.
         
         
            ¶Howe ſyr Loys of Xancere wente
to ſe the erle of Foize at Ortays / and
howe before the duke of Lancaſtre at
Burdeaux / there were dedes of armes
done bytwene fyue frenchmen
and fyue englyſſhe men / and howe
the duches of Lancaſtre wente with
her doughter in to Caſtyle to kynge
Iohan. Cap. C.liiii.
            
               IN this ſeaſō ſir Loys of
Xancer marſhall of Fraūce
was in Languedoc / in the
marches of Tholouſe and
Carcaſſone / and he knewe
well of the treatye that was
made bytwene the duke of
Berrey and therle of Foiz / for the maryage of
the duke of Bowlonges doughter / whome the
duke of Berrey wolde haue / though the damoſell
were right yonge. Than the marſhall had
affection to go & ſe the erle of Foyz / as I was
enfourmed by his men at Ortays / for whan
he came thyder he founde me there. He came at
the ſendynge of the frenche kynge / and I ſhall
ſhewe you why & wherfore. The frenche kyng
was as thā yonge and had deſyre to trauayle / 
and he had neuer ben as than in Languedoc / 
whiche is a great countrey / and full of cyties / 
townes and caſteles and as than nygh all dyſtroyed
and waſted / for the duke of Berry and
his counſayle / who had the gouernaūce of that
countrey / had greatly enpoueryſſhed and pylled
the countrey / by tayles and great oppreſſyons / 
the complayntes wherof came to the kynges
eares / by reaſon that he was newly entred
in to the domynacion of his Realme. And the
kynge ſayde he wolde go in to Languedoc to
vyſite that countrey / and alſo to go and ſe the
pope whome he had neuer ſene before / and alſo
in that voyage he ſayd he wolde ſe the erle of
Foiz / of whome he had herde ſo moche honour
and larges ſpokē of. Thus the marſhall went
forthe on his waye / and departed fro the cytie
of Tholous / with a fyue hundred horſe / and
rode ſo longe yt he came to Tarbe in Bygore / 
and fro thence to Morloys in Bierne. And the
erle of Foiz who was ſignyfied of his comyng
was ioyfull / and cōmaunded all his offycers
that the towne of Ortays ſhulde be well aparelled
to receyue him / for he ſayd the marſhals
comynge pleaſed hym ryght well. lodgynges
for his men were made redy / and the erle rode
out in to the feldes to mete with hym / and mothan
thre hundred horſes / and there receyued
hym with good chere. And he was at Ortays
a ſyre dayes / and the marſhall ſayd to the erle / 
howe the frenche kynge had great affection to
ſe the countrey of Languedoc / and to ſe hym.
Than the erle aunſwered and ſayd. Syr / the
kynge ſhall be ryght welcome / and gladde I
wolde be to ſe hym. yea / but ſir quod the marſhall / 
it is the kynges entenſion at his comyng
playnely to knowe / whether ye wyll holde you
frenche or engliſſh / for alwayes ye haue diſſymuled
out the warre / for ye wolde neuer arme
you for no deſyre. A ſir quod the erle I thanke
you / in that ye haue ſhewed me ſomoche / For
ſyr / though I wolde neuer arme me / nor take
no parte / there hath been good cauſe why. As
for the warre bytwene Englande and Fraūce / 
I haue nothynge to do therwith / I holde my
countrey of Bierne of no man / but of good and
the ſworde. What haue I to do to put my ſelfe
in ſeruytude or in dyſpleaſure of one kynge or
other / yet I knowe well myne aduerſaryes of
Armynake haue done that in them is to bring
me in the indyngnacion of bothe partyes / for
or the prince of Wales wente in to Spayne by
the informacyon of the erle of Armynake / the
prince wolde haue made me warre / he was ſo
ſore moued therto / that he had done ſo / and ſir

Iohan Chandos had nat broken his purpoſe / 
but I thanke god alwayes I haue borne my
ſelfe as mekely and as curteyſſy as I coulde / 
and ſhall do as longe as I lyue / and whan I
am deed / let the maters go as they wyll. Thus
the erle of Foyze and the marſhall paſſed the
tyme togyder. And at their departure the erle
gaue hym a fayre courſer / a fayre mule / and a
nother good horſe / all thre togyther rychely ſadylled
and aparelled. And he gaue to ſyr Roberte
of Challus and to ſyr Rycharde Dolphyn / 
to eche of them two hūdred frankes / and
to fyue other ſquyers / to eche of them fifty frankes.
Than the marſhall toke leaue to departe
to Tholous. And I ſyr Iohan Froyſart was
there the ſame tyme / and wolde haue departed
fro Ortays with hym / but the Erle of Foyze
wolde nat ſuffre me / and ſayd I ſhulde nat as
than departe. So it behoued me to byde his
pleaſure. Sir Loys departed fro Ortays and
rode to Tarbe / and the lorde Dolphyn of Bygore
conueyed him / and ſir Peter of Caleſtan
one of the erle of Foiz knyghtes.
            ABoute the ſame ſeaſon there was at
Burdeaux a dede of armes done before
the duke of Lancaſtre / by fyue engliſſhmen
of his owne houſe / and fyue frenche
menne / ſome of theym were of the marſhall of
Fraunce houſe. Fyrſt / by 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser

Villyers frenche / and the ſonne of the lorde of
Chaumonte gaſcone englyſſhe. The fyfte by
Willyam Foucalt frenche / againſt the brother
of the lorde of Chaumont englyſſhe. And to ſe
theſe armes acomplyſſhed / dyuers knyghtes
and ſquiers of Bierne of therle of Foiz houſe / 
toke their way towarde Burdeaux / & I wente
with them in company. bytwene Ortars and
Burdeaux is but .xxiiii. myle. There we ſawe
the ſayde armes done before ſaynte Andrews / 
in the preſence of the duke of Lancaſtre and the
duches / their doughter / and other ladyes and
damoſels of the coūtrey. Theſe knightes were
nat all armed at ones / but euery man by hym
ſelfe with his felowe aparte. their armes were
thre courſes with a ſpeare / thre ſtrokes with a
ſworde / thre with an are / and thre with a dagger
and all a horſehacke. And this they dyd in
thre dayes / and none of all tenne hurte / but ſir
Raymon ſlewe the baſtardes horſe / wherwith
the duke of Lancaſtre was ſore dyſpleſed / and
blamed greatly the knight bicauſe he bare his
ſtaffe ſo lowe / and the duke gaue the baſtarde
one of his horſes. Whan this was accomplyſſhed / 
euery man deꝑted to their owne houſes.
            AN one after the ducheſſe of Lancaſtre
ordayned to goo in to Caſtyle / and to
leade with her Katheryne her doughter / who
ſhulde haue in maryage the kynge of Caſtyls
ſonne. And the ducheſſe entente was / fyrſte or
ſhe wolde entre in to Caſtyle to go to Mantuell / 
where ſomtyme was ye batayle bytwene
kynge don Peter her father / agaynſte kynge
Henry of Caſtyle / and of ſir Bertram of Cleſquyn.
And there ſhe purpoſed to make iuſte enquiry
where the kynge her father lay buryed / 
and to dygge vp his bones / and to haue them
to the cytie of Cyuill / and there to bury theym
agayne rychly / as it appertayned to a kynge.
In the begynnynge of Marche / whanne the
ſonne beganne to mount / and the dayes to encreaſe / 
than the duches of Lancaſtre was redy
with her doughter / and ſo departed fro Burdeaux
and went to Bayon / and there the duke
of Lancaſtre toke leaue of her / and he retourned
to Burdeaux. And the ladyes rode forthe
to Dape / and there ſhe was well receyued / for
the cyte of Dape was vnder the obeyſaunce of
the kynge of Englande. There ſhe reſted two
dayes / and than paſſed throughe the countrey
of Baſquence / and paſſed by the paſſe of Rouceualx / 
and entred in to Nauerre / and came to
Panpilona / and there founde the kyng of Nauer
and the quene / who receyued the ducheſſe
honourably. The quene of Nauer was ſuſter
to the kynge of Caſtyle. The duches and her
doughter were a monethe paſſynge throughe
the realme of Nauer / for they taryed with the
Kynge and with the quene a certayne ſpace / 
and their coſtes and charges were borne and
payed for. Than they entred in to Spaygne / 
and at the entre of the realme they founde of
the kynge of Caſtyls ſeruauntes redy there to
receyue theym / acordynge as they were commaunded.
And than the yonge prince was called
prince of Galyce.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe the duches of Lancaſtre departed
fro the kynge of Caſtyle / and
wente to Mantuell to brynge her fathers
bones to Ciuyll / and howe the
frenche kynge ſent ambaſſadours to
the erle of Foize to treate for the maryage
of the duke of Berrey his vncle / 
with the doughter of the erle of
Boloyne. Cap. C.lv.
            
               WHan all theſe matters
were renewed and the maryage
confyrmed / than the
ducheſſe of Lancaſtre lefte
her doughter with the king
& with her yonge huſbande
that ſhulde mary her / who
was of the age of eight yeres. the duches toke
leaue of ye kynge to go to Mantuell / the kyng
ſent with her of the greateſt men of the courte
to a company her. Thus ſhe came to Mantuell / 
and dyd ſo moche that ſhe knewe the trouth
where her father was buryed. Than he was
dygged vp / and his bones waſſhed and bawmed / 
and wrapped in leade / and brought to
the cytie of Ciuyll / and there receyued with
proceſſyon without the cytie / and the bones
brought in to the cathedrall churche / and there
reuerently and ſolēply his obſequy was done / 
and there at was king Iohan and his yonge
ſonne the prince of Galyce / and the moſt parte
of prelates and barons of the realme. After the
obſequy doone / euery man retourned to their
owne places. The kynge of Caſtyle wente to
the vale of Sory / and his ſon̄e and his yonge
wyfe with hym / and the ducheſſe of Lancaſtre
to Medena de Campo / a good towne / wherof
ſhe was lady / by reaſon of the confyrmacyon
of the peace / & there ſhe lay a ſeaſon. ¶ Nowe
lette vs leaue to ſpeke of them and of Caſtyle / 
tyll a nother tyme / and let vs ſpeke of the maryage
of the duke of Berrey / and alſo of other
inſydentes that folowed.
            THe duke of Berrey who had maryed
the lady Iane of Armynake to his firſt
wyfe / after ſhe was dyſſeaſed he hadde great
imagynacyon to be maryed agayne / and that
he well ſhewed. for whan he ſawe howe he had
myſſed of the duke of Lancaſtres doughter / he
than ſet clerkes to write / and ſent meſſangers
to therle Gaſcon of Foiz / who had the kepyng
of the erle of Boulonges doughter / more than
the ſpace of nyne yeres. And bycauſe the duke
of Berrey coulde nat come to this maryage / 
but by the daunger of the erle of Foize / for nother
for pope / father / mother / nor frende that
the damoſell had / the erle wolde do nothynge / 
without it were his owne pleaſure. Than the
duke of Berrey deſyred effectuouſly the frēch
kynge his nephue / and the duke of Burgoyne
his brother to helpe and aſſyſt hym in this maryage.
            THe frenche kyng laught and had good
ſporte at the duke of Berrey his vncle / 
bycauſe he was olde / and ſo hote in loue / and
ſaid to him. Fayre vncle / what ſhall ye do with
a yonge mayde / ſhe is nat twelue yere of age / 
and ye be .xl. by my faythe it is great foly for
you to thynke therof / ſpeke for my coſyn Iohan
your ſonne / he is yonge / the mater is more
mete for hym than for you. ſyr quod the duke / 
I haue ſpeken all redy for my ſonne / but the
erle of Foize wyll in no wyſe agree therto / bycauſe
my ſonne is of the blode of them of Armynake / 
who be at warre togyder / and haue
ben longe. If the lady be yonge I ſhall ſpare
her a thre or four yere / tyll ſhe be a parfyte woman.
Well fayre vncle quod the kyng / I feare
me ſhe wyll nat ſpare you ſo longe / but ſeynge
ye haue ſo great affection therto / I ſhall ayde
you as moche as I may. It was nat longe after
but that the kynge ordayned the lorde de la
Ryuer and ſyr Bureau his ſouerayne chamberlayne
to go in yt voyage to the erle of Foiz / 
and with them the erle of Daſſy. And the duke
of Burgoyne ordeyned to go thyder on his be
halfe the byſſhop of Anthune / and ſir Gylliam
of Tremoyle / and the duke of Berrey deſyred
Iohan erle of Sanxer / a ſage and a valyaunt
knyght to go with the other. Theſe fyue lordes
were apoynted to go to the erle of Foize / 
and to deſyre to haue the yonge lady in maryage
for the duke of Berrey. Theſe lordes departed
and apoynted to mete togyder at Auignon
with pope Clement / about Candelmas
they departed and toke the waye to Nyſmes / 
and ſo to Auignon. They paſſed by Mounte
pellyer / and rode by ſmall iourneys and great
exſpence / and paſſed by Beſyers and came to

Carcaſſone / and there they founde ſir Loys of
Xancere marſhall of Fraunce / who receyued
them with good there / and he ſhewed theym
moche of the erle of Foiz eſtate / for he had ben
there within two monthes before. Than they
departed fro Carcaſſone and wente to Tholous / 
and there reſted / and than ſente meſſangers
to the erle of Foiz to Ortays in Byerne.
And there began to treate for this maryage / 
but it was farre of / for at the begynnynge the
Erle of Foyze was colde / bycauſe the duke of
Lancaſtre had ſente to hym to haue the ſame
lady / for his ſonne the lorde Henry erle of Derby.
By reaſon of this longe taryenge and delayeng
of this treatye / it was ſaid and noyſed
that the maryage ſhulde nat be. And all their
aunſweres that they had fro the erle of Foize / 
wickely they ſente worde therof to the duke of
Berrey / who was at Nonnecte in Auuergne.
And the duke who had none other deſyre but
to bringe the mater aboute / wrote often tymes
agayne to them with freſſhe meſſangers / deſyrynge
them nat to ceaſe tyll they had brought
the mater to paſſe. And the erle of Foyze who
was ſage and ſubtyle / ſawe well the ardent deſyre
that the duke of Berrey had / and the hoter
that he was the colder was he / and he handeled
the matter ſo wyſely / that by the full agrement
of all partyes / and yet ſore deſyred therto / 
he hadde thyrty thouſande frankes for the
charges of the ladyes expenſes / for ſuche yeres
as ſhe had been with hym / if he had more demaūded
more he ſhulde haue had / but he dyd
it ſo to haue thanke of the duke of Berrey / and
that he ſhulde perceyue that he had done ſome
what for hym.
            WHan this mater was concluded and
all partyes agreed / thanne the erle of
Foiz ſente his coſyn the lady to Morleaus / 
accompanyed with fyue hundred ſpeares / 
of whome were capytayns ſyr Eſpaigne
du Lynn / ſyr Raynolde Guyllam / ſyr Peter
Caleſtan / ſir Adam of Cacaſſe / ſir Manalte
of Nonnables / and ſir Pier of Kees / and in
the feldes the lady was delyuered to the frenche
ambaſſadours / on the behalfe of the duke
of Berrey. There was ſyr Loys of Xancere
with a fyue hundred ſpeares / and other company / 
who receyued the lady / and there tooke
their leaues and departed. They of Foize retourned / 
and the frenche men ledde forthe the
lady. The duke of Berrey had ſente to her chares
and chareottes rychely garnyſſhed / and
horſe / hackeneys / and aparell for her body and
for her heed / as freſſhe and as ryche as though
it had been for the frenche quene. Thus they
rode forthe / and I ſir Iohan Froyſart auctor
of this boke rode in their company / for often
tymes whan I wolde haue taken leaue of the
erle of Foiz / he wolde ſaye to me / howe I had
no dede to make ſo great haſte / and badde me
whan I wolde retourne to go in good company / 
ſo I retourned in this ſayde company.
This yonge ducheſſe of Berrey (for ſo I wyll
name her fro hence forthe) and all her company
rode ſo longe that they came nere to Auignon.
There ſhe reſted at a towne called Vile
Neufe / without the towne of Auignon / in a
houſe of the popes. And the nexte daye aboute
nyne of the clocke / all the cardynals that were
there at that tyme mette with her / and ſo paſſed
the bridge of Roſue in grete eſtate / the lady
rydynge on a whyte palfrey whiche the pope
had ſent her. Than ſhe came to the popes palays
in Auignon and there alighted and went
to ſe the pope / who ſate in cōſyſtory in a chayre
pontyficall. The pope kyſt her mouth bycauſe
of lygnage. Than the ducheſſe and her company
wente to dyner with many cardynalles / 
to the houſe of the cardynall of Thuryn / nere
to the popes palyce. This was on a wednyſdaye / 
and the nexte daye they all dyned in the
ſame houſe agayne. I may well ſaye that the
comyng of this lady to Auignon coſt the pope
the ſome of tenne thouſande frankes. The fridaye
ſhe ſupped in the palays and tooke her
leaue of the pope / and the ſaturday ſhe departed
and rode to dyner to Orange / and there
lay all night / for her coſyn germayne was princeſſe
therof. The ſonday ſhe departed and he
                  •
               
caryage before and paſſed to Valance / and
than to Vien / and ſo to Lyon ſur le Rone / and
there reſted two dayes / than fro thens to Breſ
                  •
               e / 
and ſo entred in to the countie of Foreſtes / 
and paſſed through the countrey / and ſo came
to la Paleſſe in Burbonois and ſo to Quiſſy / 
than to Hanche / and ſo to Ryon in Auuergne / 
and there reſted two dayes or the duke of Berrey
came thyder / who came thyder on Whytſoneuyn / 
and on Whytſonday betymes he maryed
the lady. This was a noble weddynge
and a gret feeſt / there was the erle of Boloyne / 
the erle of Eſtampes / and the erle Dolphyn of

Auuergne. this feeſt and iuſtes endured foure
dayes. All this I ſir Iohan Froyſart auctor
of this boke ſawe with myne eyen / for I was
there preſente.

            ¶Howe certayne wyſe men treated
for a peace to endure thre yeres bytwene
Fraunce and Englande / and
all their alyes aſwell on the one parte
as on the other by lande and by ſee.
Cap. C.lvi.
            
               YE haue herde here before
howe there was a treuſe taken bytwene
all partyes and garyſons / 
bytwene the Ryuer of Loyr and
the ryuer of Dordone / and of Geronde / 
vnto the feeſt of ſaynt Iohan Baptyſt / 
coūted as than in the yere of grace a thouſand
thre hundred fourſcore and nyne. This treuſe
dutynge / there were ſome great men and ſage
on bothe partyes / bothe of Englande and of
Fraunce / that buſyed themſelfe to treate for a
peace to endure thre yeres / both by water and
by lande. And the entenſyon of them ye treated
in this mater was to compriſe in their treatye
for the frenche party / all ſuche as were beſyed
with their warre. Firſt to haue compryſed the
realme of Caſtyle holy / as well by lande as by
water / and in lyke maner the realme of Scotlande.
And on the englyſſhe partye ſhulde be
compriſed all their alyes / and the kynge and
realme of Portugale / and dyuers barones of
hygh Gaſcon. Theſe entreatours had moche
payne and trauayle or they came to their ententes / 
for the ſcottes wolde in no wyſe cōſent.
For whanne worde therof came to kynge Roberte
of Scotlande fro the frenche kynge / his
owne perſone wolde lyghtly haue greed therto / 
for he deſyred no warre. On a daye he called
before hym all the barones and prelates of
Scotlande / ſuche as ought to gyue counſayle
in that mater / for without their knowlege the
kynge wolde do nothyng / if he had done / they
wolde nat haue kepte it. There openly was
redde in all their preſence / the letters that the
frenche kynge had ſente thyder to the kynge / 
and to the realme of Scotlande / the entente
wherof was / that the frenche kyng wolde haue
them of Scotland to be compriſed with him / 

                  〈◊〉
                to agre to a treuſe for thre yeres by lande
and by water bytwene Englande and theym.
This tydynges was harde to them / and they
ſayde. The frenche kynge canne do nothynge
but to haue treuce / whan it is tyme to make
warre. We haue in this yere ouercome the englyſſhmen / 
and the ſeaſon is ryght good / and
lykely that we ſhall ouercome them agayne the
ſeconde tyme: yea / and the thyrde alſo. There
was great debatynge of the matter bytwene
them / but in no wyſe they wolde conſente therto.
Fynally they acorded to ſende a byſſhoppe
and thre knyghtes in to Fraunce to the kynge
and to his counſayle / to the entent to breke the
treaties / and to ſhewe the good wyll of the ſcottes
that they had to the warre. The byſſhoppe
of ſaynt Andrews and ſyr Archambalte Duglas / 
ſyr Willyam Lymſey / and ſyr Iohan
ſaynt Clere. Theſe departed as ſoone as they
myght / and toke the ſee and arryued at Sluſe
and than rode to Parys. and before the kyng
and his counſayle they ſhewed their letters of
credence / ſente in the name of all the barones
and prelates of the realme of Scotlāde. They
were well herde / and the frenche men percyued
well the great affection that they hadde to
procede / and to contyne we the warre agaynſte
Englande / howe be it the treatye was ſo farre
paſt and promyſed that it coulde nat be reuoked
agayne. Than the ſcottes were ſwetely
anſwered / howe there was no remedy but that
they muſte nedes procede to the peace. Thus
the frenche men tooke a treuſe / by meanes of
ſuche as treated for the mater / there were dyuers
metynges bytwene the partyes at Balingham / 
bytwene Boloyne and Calays. So
often they mette and debated the maters that
a treuce was taken / gyuen and acorded / bytwene
Englande and Fraunce (for ſuche as
were treaters of the mater / were prelates / gret
lordes and wyſemenne of bothe realmes) and
all their adherentes and alyes / by ſee and by
lande / to endure fermely without diſſymulacyon
of any ſhadowe of male engyn / the ſpace
of thre yeres. The entreatours of the frenche
partye were at Boloyne / as the byſſhoppe of
Bayeur / the erle Valery of ſaynt Pole / ſir Willyam
of Melyn / ſir Nycholas Bracque / and
ſir Iohan le Mercier. And at Calays for the

Englyſſhe parte was the byſſhop of Durham / 
ſir Willyam Montague erle of Saliſbury / 
ſir Wyllyam Beauchampe capitayne
of Calais / Iohan Lauon and Nycholas of
Gaberthe / and Richarde Roell clerke doctor
in lawe. Theſe mette togyder in the myddes
of the waye bytwene Calays and Boloyne.
at a place called Balyngham.
            In this tyme great brute was in Fraunce
and in other places / of a great feeſt and iuſtes
that the yonge kyng Charles wolde make
at Parys / at the fyrſt entryng of Iſabell ye
frēche quene: agaynſt whiche feeſt knightes / 
ſquyers / ladyes and damoſelles apparelled
them to be at that tryumphe: Of the whiche
feeſt I ſhall ſpeke more here after / and of the
charter of the peace that was engroſed & ſealed
bytwene the parties.
            yE ſhall knowe that whan I ſir Iohan
Froyſſarte authour of this hyſtorie
was departed fro Ortays fro
the erle of Foiz / as ye haue herde here before:
and wente in cōpany with the lorde de la Ryuer
and the lorde Guyllyam of Tremoyle / 
who brought the yonge ducheſſe of Berrey / 
doughter to the erle of Boulonge to ye duke
of Berrey / who wedded her in the towne of
Ryon in Auuergne / as it is conteyned here
before in this hyſtorie: for at all theſe maters
I was preſent / wherfore I maye well ſpeke
therof. And whan I came to Parys I foūde
there the gentyll lorde of Coucy a good lorde
of myne / who had newly maryed a yonge lady / 
doughter to the duke of Lorayne: Whiche
lorde made me good chere / and demaunded
of me newes of the countrey of Foiz and
Biern / and of pope Clement beyng at Auygnon / 
and of the maryage bytwene Berrey
and Boulonge / and of another great frende
of myne and good lorde and mayſter / therle
Beraunt dolphyn of Auuergne. And to all
his demaūdes I anſwered all that I knewe / 
ſo that he was content. Than he deſyred me
to go with hym in to Cambreſys / to a caſtell
that the kynge had gyuen hym / called Creue
cure / a two leages fro Cābrey / and nyne leages
fro Valenſenes. And ſo I rode in his cō
               pany.
And as we rode by the way he ſhewed
me / howe the byſſhoppe of Bayeux and the
erle of ſaynt Pole and other were at Boloyn
ſent thyder by the frēche kyng / to cōclude the
truce. & howe that for kyng Richarde kynge
of Englāde there were at Calys / the byſſhop
of Durham & therle of Saliſbury / wt other.
and howe they had been there the ſpace more
thanne a moneth / abydynge for the ambaſſadours
of Scotlande / who were as than newly
come thyder. He ſayde howe his coſyn the
erle of ſaynt Pole had writen to hym therof / 
and howe the frenche kynge had ſente to the
kynge of Scottes / and to his counſayle that
he ſhulde agree to the truce / for the englyſſhe
men wolde conſente to no peace / without the
ſcottes were compriſed in the ſame. Thus we
rode tyll we came to Creue cure / and there I
was with hym thre dayes. Thā I toke leaue
of hym and went to Valencennes / and there
I taryed fyftene dayes. Than I wente in to
Holande to ſe a gentyll lorde and good mayſter
of myne the erle of Bloyes / and founde
hym at Eſtōchoucke. he made me good chere
and demaunded of me ſome tidynges / and I
ſhewed him ſuche as I knewe. I taryed with
hym a moneth there and at Gede. Than I retourned
in to Fraunce to knowe the trouthe
of the cōcluſion that was taken bytwene Englande
and Fraunce at Balyngham. Alſo I
purpoſed to be at the feeſt that ſhulde be at
Parys at the entre of the Frenche quene / to
knowe the trouthe of all theſe maters / I retourned
throughe Brabaunt and ſo came to
Parys / eyght dayes before the feeſt began.
Than I fell in company with the lordes of
Fraunce and of Scotlande / ſuche as had ben
at the makynge of the truce bytwene Englā
               de
and Fraunce. And I fell in acqueyntaūce
with ſir Guyllyam of Melyn / who ſhewed
me all the hole mater / and howe the Erle of
ſaynt Pole was paſſed in to Englande to ſe
kynge Rycharde / and to confyrme the truce
that was graunted for thre yeres: and that he
ſhulde retourne agayne to be at the ſaid gret
feeſt. Than I demaūded of the ſaid ſir Guillyam / 
what lordes of Scotlande had been at
the ſayd treatie. I demanuded it / bycauſe in
my youthe I had ben in Scotlande / and ſerched
all the realme to the wylde ſcottes. And
while I was there I taried a ſpace in yt court
of kyng Dauyd of Scotlande / & there I had
acqueyntaūce of the moſt parte of ye lordes &
knightes of Scotlāde / therfore I demaūded
who had been there. And this ſir Melyn anſwered

me and ſaide / howe there had ben the
byſſhop of Bredon / & ſir Iames and ſir Dauyd
Lymſay / and ſir Water of ſaynt Clere.
I bare his ſayeng awaye / and dyde putte in
writynge all that I hadde ſene and herde.
And ſhall ſhewe the trouthe what I ſawe &
knewe of this feeſt / and of the fyrſt entryng
of quene I ſabell in to Parys.

               THe ſonday the twētie

was marueyle to beholde. And the ſame ſondaye
in the mornyng there was aſſēble made
in the churche of ſaynte Denyce / of noble ladyes
of Fraunce / ſuche as ſhulde accompany
the quene / and of ſuche lordes as ſhulde aſſyſt
the quenes lytters & other ladyes. And there
was of the burgeſſes of Parys twelue hundred
an horſebacke raynged in the feldes on
bothe ſydes of the way / aparelled in gownes
of one ſute / of clothe of Baudkyn / grene and

couered / well a companyed with lordes / 
and paſſed through the hyghe ſtrete of ſaynte
Denyce / and ſo rode to the palays / and there
taryed for the kynge. That day theſe two ladyes
went no further. Than ye frenche quene
and the other ladyes ſet forwarde / as the ducheſſe
of Berrey / the ducheſſe of Burgoyne / 
the duches of Thourayn / the duches of Bare
the counteſſe of Neuers the lady of Coucy / 
and other ladyes and damoſelles all in good
ordre. all their lytters were aparelled as richly
as myghte be. But ye duches of Thourayne
had no lytter / ſhe rode a lone vpon a fayre pal
frey rychly aparelled / and ſhe rode on the one
ſyde by the quenes lytter / and it was aſſyſted
with the duke of Thourayne and the duke of
Burbone / at the fore heed on bothe ſydes.
And in the myddes on bothe ſydes the lytter
were the duke of Berry and the duke of Burgoyne / 
and at the fete was the lorde Peter of
Nauer and therle of Oſtrenaunt. The quenes
lytter was richely apparelled and diſcouert.
Than nexte folowed on a ryche apparelled
Palfrey the ducheſſe of Berrey / & ſhe

that came after in chariottes and palfrayes / 
and knightes that folowed / there was no mē
               cion
made. And as for ſergeauntes and offycers
of armes had buſyneſſe ynoughe to do
to make way / and to breke the preace. There
was ſuche people in the ſtretes / that it ſemed
that all the worlde had ben there.
            
               AT the fyrſt gate of ſaynt Denice
entryng in to Parys / there was
a Heuyn made full of ſterres / &
within it yonge chyldren apparelled
lyke angelles ſwetely ſyngynge.
And amonge them an ymage of our
lady holdyng in fygure a lytell chylde playeng

great nutte. This Heuyn was hyghe and richely
apparelled with the armes of Fraunce
with a baner of the ſonne ſhynyng of golde / 
caſtyng his rayes. This was deuyſed by the
kynge for the feeſt of the iuſtes. The quene
and the other ladyes as they paſſed vnder in
at ye gate / they had great pleaſure to beholde
it / and ſo had all other that paſſed by. Than
whan the Quene and the ladyes were paſte
by / than they came a ſofte pace before the foū
               tayne
in a ſtrete of ſaynt Denice / whiche condyte
was couered ouer with a clothe of fyne
aſure / paynted full of Floure de lyces of golde / 

and the pyllers were ſerte full of the armes
of dyuers noble lordes of Fraunce. and
out of this foūtayn there iſſued in great ſtremes
Punent and clarre: And about this foū
               tayne
there were yonge maydens richely apparelled / 
with ryche chapelettes on their heedes
ſynginge melodiouſly. Great pleaſure
it was to here them: And they helde in their
handes Cuppes and goblettes of golde / offryng
and gyueng to drinke / all ſuche as paſſed

them / and had great pleaſure of that deuyſe / 
and ſo dyde all other ladyes and damoſelles
that ſawe it.
            
               THan after / vnder the mynſter of
the Trinyte / in the ſtrete there
was a ſtage / and thervpon a caſtell.
And a longe on the ſtage
there was ordeyned the Paſſe of
kynge Salhadyn / and all their dedes in perſonages / 
the Chriſten men on the one parte / 
and the Sarazins on the other parte. & there
was in perſonages all the lordes of name / 
that of olde tyme hadde ben armed / and had
done any feates of armes at ye Paſſe of Salhadyne / 
and were armed with ſuche armure
as they than vſed. And thanne a lytell aboue
them there was in perſonages the Frenche
kynge and the twelue peeres of Fraunce / armed
with the blaſon of their armes. & whan
the Frenche quenes lytter was come before
this ſtage / ſhe reſted there a ſeaſon. Thanne
the perſonages on the ſtage of kyng Rycharde
departed fro his company / and wente to
the Frenche kynge / and demaunded lycence
to go and aſſayle the Sarazins / and ye kyng
gaue hym leaue. Than kynge Rycharde retourned
to his twelue companyons. Than̄e
they all ſette them in order / and incontynent
wente & aſſayled the kynge Salhadyne and
the Sarazins. There in ſporte there ſemed
a great bataile / and it endured a good ſpace.
This pagiaunt was well regarded. Than̄e
the quene paſſed forthe and came to ye ſecōde
gate of ſaynt Denyce. And there was a caſtell
ordayned / as was at the fyrſte gate: and
a heuyn clouded / and full of ſterres richely
deuyſed / and therin the fygure of God lyttynge
in maieſtie / the father / the ſonne / and
the holygooſt. And within the Heuyn chyldren
in fygure of angelles ſwetely ſyngyng / 
whiche pagiaunt was greatly prayſed. And
as the quenes lytter paſſed vnder the gate of
Paradiſe / there were two angelles came out
and came downe holdynge in their handes a
ryche crowne of golde / garnyſſhed with precious
ſtones. And they ſette fayre and eaſely
the crowne on ye quenes heed / ſynging right
ſwetely this verſe. Dame / as ye be encloſed
bytwene the Floure de lyces / ſo ye be quene
of the realme of Fraunce / & ſo drewe agayne
in to paradyſe. Than they paſſed forthe and
came before the chapell of ſaynt Iames. And
there was a ſcaffolde richely deuyſed / on the
right hande as the quene rode / couered ouer
with ryche arras / and drawen aboute with
curteyns / in maner of a chambre. And within
there were mē playeng vpon orgās ryght
ſwetely: And all the ſtrete of ſaynt Denyce
was couered ouer with clothes of ſylke and
chamlet / ſuche plentie / as thoughe ſuche clothes
ſhulde coſt nothynge. And I ſir Iohan
Froiſſart authour of this hyſtorie was preſent / 
and ſawe all this / and had great marueyle
where ſuche nombre of clothes of ſylke
were goten. There was as great plentie as
though they had ben ī Alyſandre or Damas / 
and all the houſes on bothe ſides of the great
ſtrete of ſaynt Denice vnto the bridge of Parys / 
were hanged with clothes of Arras of
dyuers hiſtories / the whiche was pleaſure to
beholde. Thus they paſſed forthe a ſoft pace
and ſo came to the gate of the chatelet of Parys:
and there the quene reſted to ſe the other
goodly deuyſes that were there ordayned.
            AT the gate of the chatelet of Parys
there was a caſtell made of woode &
tymbre / as ſtrōgly made / as it ſhuld
haue endured .xl. yeres. The whiche caſtell
was enbatylled / and at euery lope there was
a man of armes armed at all peces. And in ye
ſame caſtell there was a bedde made / richely
encourteyned and apparelled / as it had been
to haue ſtande in the kynges chambre. & this
bedde was called ye bedde of Iuſtyce: and in
this bedde there lay by figure ſaynt Anne. in
this caſtell there was a playne / for the caſtell
cōteyned a gret ſpace: & this playne was full
of trees / and full of Hares / cones / & byrdes / 
that flewe in and out: For whan they were a
brode they flewe thider agayne for feare of ye
people. And out of theſe trees there iſſued a

whyte Harte / and wente to the bedde of Iuſtyce:
and out of the other parte of the wode
there iſſued out a Lyon and an Egle properlye / 
and freſſhely approched the Harte and
the bedde of Iuſtyce. Than came there out
of the trees a .xii. yonge maydens richely apparelled / 
with chapelettes of golde on their
heedes / holdynge naked ſwordes in their hādes / 
and they wente bytwene the Harte / the
Lyon / and the Egle / and there they ſhewed
them ſelfe redy to defende the Harte and the
bedde of Iuſtyce. This deuyſe ye quene and
all other had great pleaſure to regarde. than
they paſſed forthe and came to the bridge of
Parys / whiche was couered and richely beſene.
The couerynge of grene and crimoſyn
full of ſterres / and the ſtretes hanged to our
ladyes churche. And by that tyme that the
quene and the ladyes were paſte the bridge / 
and approched to the churche of oure Lady / 
it was late: For all the waye as they wente / 
they rode but a ſofte pace. And or the Quene
and the ladies entred in to the churche of our
Lady / they foūde by they waye other playes
and paſtymes / greatly to their pleaſure.
            AMonge all other there was a mayſter
came out of Geane. He had tied
a corde on the hygheſt houſe on the
bridge of ſaynt Myghell ouer all ye houſes / 
and the other ende was tyed on the hygheſt
towre in our ladies churche. And as ye quene
paſſed by / and was in the great ſtrete called
out ladyes ſtrete / bycauſe it was late. This
ſayde mayſter with two brinnynge candelles
in his handes / iſſued out of a lytell ſtage
that he had made on the hyght of our ladyes
towre: And ſyngyng he went vpon the corde
all a longe the great ſtrete / ſo that all that
ſawe hym / hadde marueyle howe it myght
be: And he bare ſtyll in his hādes ye two brinnynge
cādelles / ſo that it myght well be ſene
ouer all Parys / and two myle without Parys.
He was ſuche a tombler / that his lyghtneſſe
was greatlye prayſed. And before the
churche of our lady the byſſhoppe of Parys
was reueſted with the armes of our lorde Ieſa
Chriſt / with all the colledge and great nō
               bre
of other of the clergy. There the Quene
a lyghted out of her lytter / and was takenne
downe by the four dukes / that is to ſaye: the

the byſſhoppe of Parys a more rycher

dyde ſette it on the quenes heed. Than̄e
they retourned agayne through the churche / 
and the quene and the ladyes ſette agayne in
their lytters / as they were before. There
were mo than fyue hūdred torches brinnyng
for it was late. Thus they were brought to
the palays of Parys / where the kynge / the
olde quene / and the ducheſſe of Orlyaunce
her doughter were. There the quene and the
ladyes lyghted fro their lytters / and eche of
theym brought in to ſeuerall chambres: and
the lordes went to their lodgynges / after the
daunſynge was paſte.
            THe nexte daye Monday / the kynge
made them all a dyner at his palis.
And at the houre of the high maſſe / 
the quene was ledde with the foreſayd foure
dukes in to the holy chapell: and there in the
maſſe ſeaſon the quene was ſacred & anoynted / 
as a Quene ought to be: And the archebyſſhoppe
of Roane dyde the obſeruaunce / 
who was called ſir Wyllyam of Vyar. After
the maſſe ſonge ſolempnely / the kynge and
the quene retourned in to their chābres / and
all other ladies ſuche as had chambres in the
palays. Than anone after the kyng and the
quene retourned in to the halle / and all other
ladyes. The great table of Marble that alwayes
ſtandeth ſtyll in the halle / was made
lengar with a great plaunche borde of Oke / 
of foure inches thycke / whiche borde was richelye
couered. And aboue the great table / 
agaynſte one of the Pyllers / was the Kynges
dreſſyng borde / ſtandynge full of veſſell

of golde and ſyluer / whiche was greatly couered
of many that ſawe it. Before the table
a longe diſcendyng downe / there were barryers
made of wode with thre alyes / & there
were ſergeauntes and vſſhers a great nombre
kepynge the entrees / to the entente that
none ſhulde entre / but ſuche as were ſeruytours
of ye table / for ye hall was ſo full of people
that a man coulde nat tourne hym / but wt
moche payne. Mynſtrelles a great nombre
pleſauntly played / euery man after his facultie.
Than the kyng and the prelates / and the
quene and the ladyes waſſhed & ſate downe
at the tables. At the kynges table ſate downe
as chiefe / the byſſhoppe of Noyan / than the
byſſhoppe of Langers / than the kynge / and

The kynge ſatte in a ſurcote of ſcarlette furred

than the duches of Burgoyne / and ye duches

and the good damoſell of Bare / than the lady

all ſatte the lady of Sailly / wyfe to ſir
Guye of Tremoyle. And at two other tables
a longe downe the hall / ſate mo than fyue hū
               dred
ladyes and damoſels. The preaſe was
ſo great / that it was great payne to ſerue thē
with their meſſes / whiche were great and no
table. I haue nat to do to make great ꝓceſſe
therof / I ſhall ſo what ſpeke of the paſtymes
yt were made bitwene the meſſes / the whiche
had been great pleaſure for the kyng to haue
ſene / if he had taryed out the hole dyner.
            FIrſte in the myddes of the palays
there was a caſtell made of tymbre
xl. fote longe and twentie fore brode
with foure towres / in euery quarter one and
one in the myddes / hygher than the other.
            This Caſtell was fygured for the cytie of
Troye / and the towre in the myddes for the
palays of ylion: And there were penōs with
the armes of the Troyans / as of kyng Priamus / 
Hector his ſonne / and his other chyldren.
And alſo the armes of ſuche other kynges
and princes / as were encloſed in Troye
with kynge Priam. This caſtell went vpon
wheles / the whiche myght be tourned euery
waye properly. This caſtell came to aſſayle
another ſorte that was therby in a pauilyon / 
whiche alſo wente vpon wheles / ſo ſoftely &
couertly / that the mouynge therof coude nat
be parceyued / and there was ye armes or the
kynges of Grece / and of other ſuche as were
at the ſiege. Alſo there was a ſhyppe properlye
deuyſed / wherin myght well be a hūdred
men of armes / and all moued by the crafte of
wheles / bothe the Caſtell / Pauilyon / & ſhip.
They of the Pauilyon and of the Shyppe / 
aſſayled euer the caſtell / and they within the
Caſtell made great defence. But this ſporce
endure nat longe / for the preace of the people
was ſo ſore about them / that no man coulde
ſtyrre. The people were ſore chafed with the
heate / and putte to moche payne. And there
was a table by the parlyament chambre dore
where at ſatte many ladyes and damoſelles.
It was by reaſon of the preace ouerthrowen
to the erthe / and the ladyes cauſed ſodainly
to ryſe without order / and ſore chafed with
the preace and heate that was in the palays.
The quene herſelfe was at the poynt to haue
been ſore diſpleaſed: Perforce a backe doore
was broken vp to gette freſſhe ayre. The ladye
of Coucy was ſore diſeaſed. Whan̄e the
kynge ſawe this mater / he commaunded to
ceaſe / and the tables in great haſt to be taken
vp / to let the ladyes and damoſelles at large.
They lefte takynge of wyne and ſpyces and
wente to their chambres. Than ſome of the
ladyes taryed ſtyll in the Palays / and ſome
wente in to the towne to their lodgynges / to
be the more at their eaſe: for with preace and
with heate / they had been ſore greued. The
lady Coucy wente to her lodgynge / & helde
her there tyll it was late.
            
               THan about fyue of the clocke the
Frenche Quene / accompanyed
with the foreſayd ducheſſes / departed
fro the palays of Parys
and toke their lytters all open / 
and ſo wente throughe the ſtretes to the kynges
lodgynge / called ſaynt Polle / on the ryuer

than a thouſande horſes. And the kyng went
fro the palays to the ryuer of Sayne / & toke
there a barge / & wente by water to his houſe
of ſaynt Polle. And for all that ye houſe was
great and large & well amended / yet ye kyng

had cauſed in the great court nere to the gate
fro the Ryuer / to be made a great halle whiche
was couered ouer with clothes of the armes
of Normandy: And the walles were hā
               ged
with clothes of arras of ſondrie hyſtories.
In this hall the kynge gaue the ladyes

and the kyng and the lordes daunſed and reuelled
all that nyght / nerchande tyll it was

ſonne to the duke of
Aniou / who wrote himſelf
kynge of Napoles / of Cycyll /

Peter of Arragon. The quene of Napoles
went to Auygnone to ſe pope Clement / and
there ſhe founde the lorde of Coucy / and had
in her company her yonge ſonne Loys. The
lorde of Coucy was ryght ioyous of her cō
               mynge.
The quene was receyued ryght honorably
of pope Clement / and of the cardynalles / 
as ſhe was well worthy / for ſhe was

There ſhe deſyred the lorde of Coucye
to helpe to conuey her ſonne Loyes in to

The lorde of Coucy agreed to go this voyage.
Thus the younge kynge of Cicyll tooke
his iourney well accompanied / whan he had
taken his leaue of the Pope and of his mother / 
all wepynge: For at the departynge of
the mother and the ſonne / cauſed their hertes
to relente: For they ſhulde departe farre a ſō

& knewe nat whan to ſe togyder agayne
For it was ordayned / that whan the maryage
was accomplyſſhed / that the yonge kynge
and the yonge Quene ſhulde take the ſee

arryue at the porte of Naples / or as nere as

            SO longe this yonge kynge Loyes

of euery man. There they refreſſhed thē

               uebertyn and ſir Raymonde of
Baighes. So long they rode / that they cāe

the Quene and their doughter was. There
the yonge kyng was nobl

                receyued / and ſpecially
the quene of Arragon was ryght ioyouſe
of the cōmynge of the lorde of Coucy / 
and thanked the yonge kynge her ſonne that
ſhulde be / for bringynge of hym in his company / 
and ſayd / that all other maters ſhulde

was confyrmed bytwene theſe two chyldren / 
but bycauſe wynter approched / they delayed
their voyage goyng to the See / For in wynter
the great Sees are perillous. They ſaid
they wolde make their prouiſyon that wynter / 
to go in to Naples the nexte Marche after.
The lorde of Coucy beyng in Arragon / 
receyued letters fro the Frenche kynge / commaundynge
hym to retourne. Than he toke
his leaue of the kynge of Arragon and of the
quene / and of the yonge kyng and his wyfe / 
and of all other lordes ſuche as were there / 
and departed. And if he myght haue had leyſar / 
he wolde haue retourned by Auignon to
haue ſene the pope and the olde quene af Naples.
But he ſente to them his excuſe / and retourned
by Auuergne in to Fraunce.
            WHan̄e this maryage was made bytwene
the yonge kyng Loyes of Cycyll / 
and the doughter of the kynge
of Arragon / wherby there was great alya
                  •
               
               ces
bytwene the parties / and they of Arragon
were bounde to ayde & to ſerue the yong
kynge / to bringe hym in to the realme of Naples / 
and nat to leaue hym tyll he had the realme
peſably of Naples and of Cicyll / with
the appendaūtes / as Paule and Calabre / and
the cytie of Gaiet / the whiche Margarete of
Duras helde. The aragonoys ſhulde ſerue
hym as longe as his warre endured with .ii.
hundred ſpeares at their coſte and charge / &
a thouſande croſbowes / and a thouſande bregandiers.
Whan the ſwete tyme of Marche

was come / and that the wyndes were apealed
and ye waters ſwaged of their rages / and
the wodes reuerduced / and that their prouyſions
were made redy at Barcelone / and the
galees redy ſuche as ſhulde go with the yong
kynge. Than he and his yonge quene tooke
their leaues of the kynge of Aragone and of
the quene / who wept at their departyng. than
the quene recōmaunded the yonge quene her
doughter to the erle of Roodes / a valyaunt
knight / & to ſir Raymon of Baighes. Theſe
two toke ye ſpeciall charge natwithſtādinge

were there in a great company. In theſe galees
were a fyftene hūdred ſpeares / two thouſande

men of warre / with dartes & paueſſes. They
wente thus fortifyed and well acompanyed / 
to reſyſt the better if nede were agaynſt their

            ¶Howe the Frenche kynge had deſyre
to go and viſyte the farre partes
of his realme: & howe he went fyrſt
in to Burgoyne and to Auygnon to
ſe pope Clement. Cap. C.lx.
            
               AFter this great Feeſt
was accompliſſhed / & that
euery lorde and lady were
gone home to their owne
houſes / as ye haue herde
here before: & that the Frē
               che
kyng ſawe that he had
truce with Englande for thre yere: he hadde
than ymaginacion to go & viſite his realme / 
ſpecially the vtwarde marcheſſe of Languedocke.
For the lorde de la Ryuer and ſir Iohan
Mercier / who were as than chefe of his
preuy coūſayle. They exhorted hym to go to
Auygnon to ſe pope Clement and the cardynalles / 
who deſyred to ſe hym / and alſo to go
to Tholous / for they ſayd to the kyng. Sir / 
a kyng in his youthe ought to viſyte his realme / 
and to knowe his people / and to lerne
how they be gouerned / the whiche ſhulde be
greatly to his profyte / and the better to be beloued
with his ſubiectes. The kyng lyghtly
enclyned to their counſayle / for he had deſyre
to traueyle and ſe newe thynges. And ye lord
de la Ryuer who was but newly come out of
thoſe marcheſſe / herde great complayntes of
the people of Tholous / of Carcaſſone / & of
Beaucayre. and they deſired greatly to ſe the
kyng / for they had ben ſore charged with tayles
and aydes by ye duke of Berrey / by the informacion
of a ſeruaunt of his called Betyſache / 
who had pytie of no man: He ſo pylled
the people that nothynge was lefte / therfore
he counſayled the kynge to go thyder to prouyde
ſome remedy / And alſo that the kynge
ſhulde ſende for the erle of Foize to come to
hym to Tholous. The kyng made him redy
to go thyder / and ſente afore all the way that
prouiſyon ſhulde be made for his cōmyng / &
ſente worde therof to his vncle the Duke of
Burgoyne and to his aūte the ducheſſe / how
he wolde come a longe throughe their countrey / 
and wolde ſe his coſyns their chyldren / 
and to bring in his company his brother the
duke of Thourayne / and his vncle of Burbone / 
whiche pleaſed greatly ye duke and the
ducheſſe. And the duke cauſed to be proclamed
a feeſt and a iuſtes to be holden at Dygnon.
and knightes & ſquiers of Burgoyne / 
of Sauoy / and of other marches adioyning
were requyred to be at this feeſt. And ſo euery
man ordred themſelfe accordingly.
            
               THus whyles the kynges prouiſyon
was a makyng / to go to Auignon &
to Languedocke. The duke of Burgoyne
on his parte made great prouiſyon to
receyue the kynge / and ſo dyde euery man in
their marcheſſe / that purpoſed to be at ye feeſt
at Dignon. The ſame ſeaſon other maters
fell in Fraunce. ye haue herde howe the duke
of Irelande (who was called erle of Oxenforde)
was banyſſhed oute of Englande / 
by the vncles of kyng Richarde / and ſpeciallye
the duke of Glouceſtre had gretteſt dyſpleaſure
to hym / ſo that to ſaue hym ſelfe he

was fledde in to Hollande / and taryed there
but a ſmall ſeaſon / in the towne of Dordregh
for he was fayne to departe thens. For duke
Aubert / who was lorde of that towne and of
Holande / denyed hym the taryeng in his coū
               trey / 
for he wolde nat kepe hym agaynſt the
wyll of his coſyns germayns of Englande / 
for all that the kynge of Englande had written
for hym / yet he was fayne to departe and
to go to Trecte a fraunches towne for all maner
of people / payeng for that they take. And
the duke of Irelande had ynoughe to paye.
For beſyde that he brought with him / he had
threſcore thouſande frankes out of Fraunce
fro the Conſtable / for the redempcion of Iohan
of Bretayne. And he was come to ye Frē
               che
kyng vnder ſaueconducte / and was there
with hym more than a yere. The kyng made
hym good chere / bycauſe he was a ſtraūger / 
Howe be it trewe it was / thoughe this duke
was with the kyng / yet ye lorde of Coucy hated
hym in his herie / for he had good cauſe.
For though the duke in all affayres was prouyded
of wytte / honoure / eloquence / and of
great largeſſe / yet he had greatly treſpaſſed
agaynſt the lorde of Coucies doughter / who
was his wyfe laufully ſpouſed. And forſoke
her without any tytell of reaſon / but by falſe
and yuell temptacyon and diſceyte / was diſceyued.
And toke another wyfe / a damoſell
of the quene of Englandes of the countrey of
Boeme / & the kyng and ye quene of Englāde
ſynfully conſented therto. And was diſpenſed
by pope Vrbane of Rome / at the inſtaūte
deſyre of the kynge and quene of Englande.
This ſynne greued greatly the conſcience of
the duke of Irelande. And bycauſe the lorde
of Coucy / who was of the counſayle of Fraū
               ce / 
and well worthy ſo to be / for he had done
good ſeruyce / & was well able to do. He ꝓcured
ſo moche by meanes of his frendes / as ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon and the lorde de la Ryuer
ſir Iohan Marcyer and other / That it was
ſayde to the duke of Irelande / that he ſhulde
departe out of Fraunce / and to go and choſe
hymſelfe another place to abyde in / where he
lyſt / ſo that it be nat in the realme of Fraūce / 
and thyder he ſhulde ſurely be cōueyed. The
duke of Irelande ſawe well / howe he was
dayly in paryll by meanes of ye lorde of Coucy
and his lygnage. Wherfore he thought it
ſhulde be beſte for hym to go farre of / rather
than to abyde nere. than he aduiſed to drawe
in to Brabant / and deſyred the kyng to write
to the ducheſſe of Brabant / yt it wolde pleace
her to ſuffre hym peſably to abyde in her coū
               trey.
The kynge wrote to his aunte the ducheſſe
of Brabant / and ſhe condiſcēded to the
kynges deſyre. The duke of Irelande was
conducted by men of the kynges to Louayne
and there he taryed / and ſomtyme he went to
a caſtell nat farre of fro the towne of Louaygne / 
the whiche he had borowed of a knyght
of Brabant. With the duke of Irelande was
the archebyſſhop of yorke / who in lykewiſe
was banyſſhed out of Englande / all for one
cauſe. This byſſhoppe was one of the Neuelles
of Englande / who in the countrey of
Northūberlande were puiſſaunt men / bothe
of landes and of lynage. There taryed theſe
two lordes at Louayne or there about / as I
herde ſaye / as longe as they lyued: For they
coude neuer come to mercy nor peace with ye
kynge of Englandes vncles. I can no farther
ſpeke of them.
            ABout the feeſt of ſaynt Mychell the
Frēche kyng departed fro his houſe
of Beautie beſyde Parys / and lefte
there the quene / and toke his waye by Troy
in Champayne to go in to Burgoyne / & his
vncle the duke of Burbone / and duke Loyes
of Thourayne and the lorde of Cou
                  •
               y / and
many other lordes and knyghtes in his company.
The kynge rode ſo longe that he came
to Dignon. The duke of Burgoyne and the
erle of Neuers his ſonne were come before
to the Chatelon on the ryuer of Sayne. whā
the kyng was come to Dignon / the ducheſſe
of Burgoyne and the coūteſſe of Neuers her
doughter receyued the kyng ioyfully / and all
other lordes for loue of the kyng. And to his
welcomynge to Dygnon / many ladyes and
damoſels were come thyder to ſe hym. there
was the lady of Sully / the lady of Vergy / 
the lady of Pagny / and dyuers other fayre ladies
and freſſhe / and well apparelled. Than
began feeſtynge / daunſynge / and carolynge.
Theſe ladyes enforſed themſelfe to daunce &
to ſyng / and to make ioye for loue of ye kyng:
and ye duke of Thourayne / the duke of Burbone
& of the lorde of Coucy. Monday / tueſday / 
and wedniſday / all thre dayes ther was
goodly iuſtes / and prices gyuen to ye beſt doers.

The kynge was eight dayes in ye towne
of Dignon in great triūphe and ſporte. The
x. daye he toke leaue of his vncle the duke of
Burgoyne / and of the ducheſſe and their children.
Thentent of ye duke of Burgoyne was
ſhortely after to folowe the kyng his nephue
and to go with hym that iourney. The kyng
deꝑted fro Dignon / whan he had taken his
leaue of all ladyes and damoſelles / and rode
ſo long by his iourneys that he came to Vile
neufe beſyde Auignon. There his houſe royall
was apparelled for hym / & there was the
cardynals of Amyens / of Aigreuell of ſaint
Marcell / of Chatell neufe / and mo than xiii.
other came and mette the kyng in the felde / &
all were gladde of the kynges cōmyng.
            THe duke of Berrey was come to Auygnon
and was lodged in the popes
palais / but he cāe to Vyle neufe
to the kynge / and laye in the lyuere of arras
called Amontays / in the way to Mountpellyer.
The duke of Burgoyne arryued there
the next day that ye kyng came thyder / by the
water of Rone / for the duke toke a barge at
Lyonſur le rone. Thus the kynge and theſe
four dukes were togyder. Than they determyned
to paſſe the bridge of Auignon and to
go & ſe the pope. And about .ix. of the clocke
in the mornyng the kyng paſſed the bridge / acompanyed
with his brother and his thre vncles
and .xii. cardynalles / and ſo went to the
popes palays / and pope Clement was redy
in his chambre of conſyſtorie / ſyttyng in his
chayre of papalyte. Whan the Frenche kyng
came in to the chambre and ſawe the pope he
enclyned hym ſelfe / and whan he came nere ye
pope roſe / and the kyng kyſt his hande & his
mouthe. Than the pope ſate downe and cauſed
the kyng to ſyr downe by hym / on a place
purpoſely prepared for hym. Than ye dukes
kyſt the popes hande and ſate downe amōge
the cardynals. Anone it was tyme of dyner / 
than they drewe in to the popes great chambre / 
where the tables were redy couered. the
pope wa
                  •
               ſhed & ſatte downe at a table alone
and kept his eſtate. The Frenche kyng ſatte
downe at another table alone / and the cardynalles
and dukes ſatte downe in order. The
dyner was plentyfull / & after dyner they had
wyne and ſpyces. Than the kyng and ye four
dukes went in to their chābres / eche of them
had a chambre apparelled in the palays / and
there they taryed a certayne dayes. The .v.
day after that the kyng came thyder / ye yonge
erle of Sauoy coſyn to the king / and nephue
to the duke of Burbone came thyder. The
kyng was right ioyfull of his cōmyng. The
Frenche kynge / the duke of Thourayne his
brother / and the erle of Sauoye / who were
lyght of corage and of ſpyrite / thoughe they
were lodged in the popes palais / nere to the
pope and to the cardynalles: yet for all that
they wolde nat abſteyne to daunce and to caroll / 
and to make ſporte amonge the ladyes
and damoſelles of Auignon. And the erle of
Geneſne brother to the pope / brought theym
in aquayntaunce with the ladyes and damoſelles
of the towne. The kynge gaue great
giftes to the ladyes and damoſelles / wherby
he had great laude and prayſe.
            
               THe pope and the cardinals were
ryght ioyfull of the kynges beyng
there / as it was reaſon that
they ſhulde ſo be / for without the
loue of the Frenche kynge their
porte ſhulde haue ben but ſmall. For they cō
               ſydred
or ought to haue conſydred / that there
was no kynge chriſtned / that were obedyent
to them / except it were for loue and fauoure / 
and alyaunce of the Frenche kyng. The kynge
of Spaygne and the kynge of Scottes
obeyed this pope Clement / and the kynge of
Aragon was but newly ſo determyned / and
that made the quene yolande of Bare (who
was coſyn germayne to the Frenche kynge)
elles he had nat done ſo / for before / the kynge
of Aragon and his father before hym was as
neuter. Therfore this pope and cardynalles
ought well to feeſt the Frenche kyng / ſeynge
their puyſſaunce and profyte that they lyued
by to kepe their eſtate / came by meanes of the
Frenche kyng. Thus the kyng taryed there
a certayne ſeaſon in great ioye & ſporte. And
for ioye of the kynges cōmynge thyder / the
pope opyned his graces to all clerkes beyng
in the courte for the ſpace of a moneth. And
gaue the nomynacions to the kyng / of all coledges / 
cathedrals / and to euery coledge two
prebendes / and reuoked all other graces before
gyuen / and wolde that the kynges graces
ſhulde ꝓcede before (as they dyd) wherby
many of the kynges clerkes were promoted.

Alſo the pope gaue graces to the duke of
Thourayne / the duke of Berrey / the duke of
Burgoyne / and to the lorde Coucy / all other
were ſtopped that had ben graunted before.
The pope was ſo curteſſe & lyberall / that for
loue of the kynges cōmyng / he graūted euery
thyng that was aſked.
            WHan the kynge had ben there a certayne
ſpace / the pope ſhewed hym
his complaynt / howe that the other
pope of Rome greatly hyndred his ryght / &
made moche trouble and diffrence in ye churche.
The kynge herde hym well / and promyſed
this pope Clement that after his returne
agayne in to Fraunce / he wolde entende to
none other thynge / but to bringe the churche
in one accorde. With thoſe wordes the pope
was greatly conforted. The kynge toke his
leaue and retourned to Vyle Neufe / and ſo
dyde his brother and vncles of Berrey & Burgoyne.
And there on a daye the kynge made
a dyner to all the cardynalles and to the erle
of Geneſne brother to the Pope. After dyner
they toke their leaues / for the kyng ſayd / that
the nexte day he wolde ryde towarde Moūtpellyer / 
and he thanked them of the reuerēce
that they had done to hym. The cardynalles
retourned to Auygnon. Than it was ordayned
that the kynge ſhulde departe the nexte
daye / his brother and the duke of Burbone
in his company. And ſo he dyd / & toke leaue
of his vncles of Berey and of Burgoyne / 
and ſayde / howe they ſhulde retourne in to
their owne countreis / for they ſhulde go no
further with hym at that tyme: For he ſayde
he wolde go to Tholous and ſende for therle
of Foiz to come thyder. His vncles were cō
               tent
therwith / for as than the kyng had ſuche
counſayle about hym / that the duke of Berrey
and the duke of Burgoyns voyces were
nat herde / without it were in ſmall maters.
The gouernyng of Lāguedocke was taken
awaye fro the duke of Berrey / and deuyded
in to Seneſchaunces to the kynges profyte / 
wherof the countreis and marcheſſe of Carcaſſone / 
of Beſyers / of Narbone / of Fonges / 
of Bygore / and of Tholous / were greatly reioyſed.
For before that ſeaſon they had been
ſore oppreſſed with tayles / that the duke of
Berrey had reyſed on them: as ye ſhall here
after whan the mater requyreth it.
            Whan the duke of Berey & the duke of burgoyn
ſawe that the kyng wolde go to Moūtpellyer
and viſyte Lāguedoc / and wolde nat
ſuffre thē to go in his cōpany / they were ſore
diſpleaſed therwt. howbeit ſagely they diſymuled
the mater / & ſayde eche to other. The
kyng gothe in to Languedoc to make in
                  •
               ſycyon
on thē that gouerned there / & to make a
treatie wt therle of Foiz / who is ye moſt proudeſt
erle now lyuēg. he neuer loued nor prayſed
any neyghbour that euer he had / nouther
Frenche kyng / Englande / Spaygne / Arragon / 
nor Nauer. The kyng taketh with him
of his counſayle / no mo but Ryuer and Mercier / 
Mōtague and the Beghe of Villayns.
Howe ſaye you to this brother ꝙ the duke of
Berrey? The duke of Burgoyne anſwered
and ſayd. The kynge our nephue is yonge / 
and he beleueth yonge counſayle: they ſhall
diſceyue hym / for ſurely the concluſyon ſhall
nat be good / and that ye ſhall ſe. It muſt behoue
vs to ſuffre for this p̄ſente tyme / but the
tyme ſhall come that ſuche as coūſaileth him
ſhall repent and the kynge alſo. Let hym go
on goddes name whider it ſhall pleaſe hym / 
and let vs retourne in to our owne coutreis / 
As long as we holde to guyder / there is none
ſhall do vs any wronge. We are two of the
chefe membres of Fraunce. Thus theſe two
dukes deuyſed togyder / & the Frenche kyng
departed the nexte day and toke the waye to
Nymes / and rode thyder to dyner. The ſaid
two dukes taryed ſtyll with the Pope thre
dayes / and ye lorde of Coucy in lykewiſe. the
fourthe daye they departed & rode in to their
owne countreis / and the kyng went fro Nymes
and laye all nyght at Lunell.
            Whan the kyng deꝑted fro Lunell he went
to dyner to Moutpellyer / it was but thre lytell
myles. There he was receyued of ye burgeſſes / 
ladyes / and damoſelles of the towne / 
for they greatly deſyred to ſe the kynge / and
many riche preſentes were gyuen to hym / for
Moūtpellyer is a puiſſaunt towne / ryche / &
full of marchandiſe. The kynge prayſed the
towne moche / and well conſydred their puiſſaūce.
And it was ſhewed the kyng that the
towne hadde ben moche richer before thanne
it was at that preſente tyme: For the duke of
Aniou and the duke of Berrey / eche of them
in their tourne hadde greatlye pylled them.

The kyng was ſorie that ye good people had
endured ſo moche dōmage / and ſayd / how he
wolde reforme the countre in to a better ſtate
Than it was ſhewed the kynge / that the pouertie
of that towne was nothyng / to that he
ſhulde fynde forwarde / For that towne of it
ſelfe hath good meanes of recoueraūce / by reſon
of the marchandiſe yt is there vſed / bothe
by lande and by ſee. But in the marcheſſe of
Carcaſſone & Tholous / & therabout / where
as the ſaid two dukes had the gouernaunce.
Loke on what thyng they had puyſſaunce to
laye on their handes there was nothyng left / 
but all taken away. For ye ſhall fynde ye people
there ſo poore / that ſuche as were wont to be
riche and puiſſaunt / nowe they are ſcant able
to labour their vynes nor landes. It is a
great pyte to ſe them / their wyues / and chyldren.
for they haue had euery yere fyue or ſixe
tayles layde on their ſhulders / and are raū
               ſomed
to the thirde or fourthe parte of their
ſubſtaunce / & ſomtyme to all toguyder. One
tayle coude nat be payde / but yt another was
redy in ye necke therof. for 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                / as it is well knowen
theſe two dukes your vncles while they
ruled in Lāguedocke / they haue leuyed in ye
countrey fro Vyle Neufe in to Tholouſyn / 
rounde about to the ryuer of Garon / and retournyng
to the ryuer of Dordone / the ſōme
of .xxx. hundred thouſande frankes. And ſpecially
ſythe the duke of Aniou departed / the
duke of Berrey hath done the more dōmage
for he founde the playne countrey and cōmontie
in good caſe / for the duke of Aniou tooke
but of the ryche men / who had wherwith to
paye. But the duke of Berrey ſpared nother
poore nor riche / for he gadered all before him
ſpecially by one of his counſayle his treaſourer
named Betyſache / who is of the nacyon
of the cytie of Beſyers. As ye ſhall here by
the complayntes of the people that wyll crye
out on hym. To theſe wordes the kyng ſaid.
As god haue my ſoule / I ſhall prouyde for
this mater or I retourne / & I ſhall puniſſhe
the treſpaſours. For I ſhall make an inquyſycion
of the ſeruantes and o
                  •
               nycers of myne
vncles ſuche as had ruled here before in the
parcies of Languedocke / and ſuche as haue
deſerued ſhalbe corrected.
            The kynge taryed at Mount pellyer the
ſpace of .xii. dayes / for the order of the towne
and the paſtyme of ladyes and damoſelles / 
ſuche as he foūde there pleaſed hym greatly.
To ſaye trouthe the kynge / as at / that tyme
was in his luſty youthe / and lyght & quycke
of ſpyrite. He daunſed and caroled amonge
the fryſco ladyes and damoſelles of ye towne
ſomtyme all nyght: And gaue and made bankettes
and ſuppers largely / and wolde gyue
to the ladyes and damoſels rynges of golde
and chaynes / to them that he reputed worthy
The kynge dyde ſo moche that he had great
laude and prayſe. And ſome of them wolde
that he had taryed there lengar than he dyd / 
for he kepte reuell / daunſyng / and ſolas: and
euery day it was newe to begyn. ¶ ye haue
herde oftentymes ſaid / howe the ſporte of ladies
and damoſels encorageth the hertes of
yonge luſty gentylmen / and cauſeth them to
deſyre and to ſeke to gette honour. I ſay this
bycauſe with the kyng there was thre gentylmen
of highe enterprice and of great valure
and that they well ſhewed / as ye ſhall here.
Fyrſt there was the yonge ſir Boucequant / 
the other ſir Raynold of Roy / and the thirde
the lorde of ſaynt Pye. Theſe thre knyghtes
were chamberleyns with the kyng / and well
beloued with him for they were well worthy
They were freſſhe / and ſerued hym well in
armes / and in all other maters. Theſe thre
beyng at Mountpellier among the ladyes &
damoſels / they toke on them to do armes the
next ſomer after. And as I was enformed / ye
prīcipall cauſe that enclyned thē therto was / 
as I ſhall ſhewe you. ye knowe well as it
hath ben reherſed here before in this hyſtorie
howe that in ye dayes of kyng Charles there
was an Englyſſhe knyght called ſir Peter
Courtney (a valyaunt knight in armes) cāe
out of Englande in to Fraūce to Paris / and
demaūded to do armes with ſir Guy of Tremoyle / 
in the preſence of the kyng or of ſuche
as wolde ſe them. ſir Guy wolde nat refuce
his offre / and in the preſence of the kyng and
of other lordes / they were armed on a daye &
ran toguyder one courſe. And than the kyng
wolde nat ſuffre them to ryn agayne toguyder / 
wherwith thēglyſſ he knyght was right
yuell content. For as he ſhewed / he wolde haue
furnyſſhed his chalenge to the vttraunce / 
but he was apeaſed with fayre wordꝭ. and it
was ſayde to hym / that he had done ynough
he ought to be content therwith. The kynge

and the duke of Burgoyne gaue hym fayre
gyftes and preſentes. Than he retourned agayne
towardes Calays. And the lorde of
Clary who was a friſcay and a luſty knyght
was charged to conuey hym. They rode ſo
longe toguyder that they came to Lucynen / 
where as the counteſſe of ſaynt Poule laye / 
ſuſter to kynge Richarde of Englande. The
lady was ioyfull of the cōmynge thyder of
ſir Peter Courtney / for ſhe hadde maryed
fyrſte his coſyn the lorde of Courtney / but he
dyed yonge / and after ſhe maryed the erle of
ſaynt Poule. The Engliſſhe men called her
madame Courtney / and nat Counteſſe of
ſaynt Poule.

            ¶Howe ſir Peter Courteney came
in to Fraunce to do armes with ſir
Guye of Tremoyle / And howe the
lorde of Clary cōueyed hym / and by
what occaſyon he dyde armes with
hym in the marcheſſe of Calais.
Cap. C.lxi.
            
               THus as ſir Peter of
Courtney and the lorde of
Clary were at Lucenen in
Arthoys with the coūteſſe
of ſaynt Paule / who was
right ioyouſe of their commynge.
And as they deuyſed
of many thynges / the counteſſe demaunded
of ſir Peter Courtney / what he thought
of the ſtate of Fraunce. He aunſwered and
ſayd. Certaynly madame / the ſtates of Fraū
               ce
are well and goodly ſerued / we can nat be
ſo ſerued in our countrey. Sir quod the lady.
Do the lordes of Fraunce and the maner
there contente you? Haue they nat made you
good chere? Surely madame quod he / their
there contenteth me paſſynglye well / but in
the caſe that I paſſed the See for / they haue
but eaſely acquyted me therin. And madame
I wyll ye knowe / that if the lorde of Clary
here preſent hadde come in to Englande / and
deſyred to haue done armes with any man / 
he ſhulde nat haue departed or he hadde ben
anſwered at his pleaſure. But I am ſerued
to the contrary. Trewe it was ſir Guye dela
Tremoyle and I were armed in the felde
eche agaynſt other / and ranne toguyder but
one courſe. Than it was ſhewed me fro the
kynge that we ſhulde do no more / ſayenge
howe we hadde done ynough. Wherfore madame
I ſaye and wyll ſay where ſoeuer I become / 
that I coulde fynde none to do armes
with me / and that was nat in my defaute / but
in the knyghtes of Fraunce. The lorde of
Clary noted well his wordes / and helde his
peaſe with great payne. Howe be it he ſuffred
hym / bycauſe he had the charge of the cō
               ueyaunce
of hym. Than the counteſſe ſayde.
Sir / ye departed right honorably fro Fraū
               ce / 
whan ye obeyed to the kynges deſyre / for
ye coude do no more / ſythe it was his pleaſure
that ye ſhulde nat.
            IN cōmyng / returnyng / and doyng
as ye haue done / none can laye any
faute in you. All ſuche as ſhall here
there of / on this ſyde the ſee or on the other / 
ſhall repute in you more honour than blame
wherfore ſir I requyre you be contente therwith.
Madame quod the knight ſo I do and
ſhall do / I ſhall neuer take thought for it.
Thus they lefte that mater and fell in other
talkynge: There he taryed all that daye and
night. The nexte mornynge ſir Petr Court
nay toke his leaue of the Counteſſe of ſaynt
Poule / and ſhe gaue hym at his departynge
a lytell chayne of golde / and to the lorde of
Clary another. Thus in the mornynge they
departed fro Lucenen / and toke the waye to
Bouloygne and came thyder and there laye
all nyght / and the nexte daye rode towardes
Margyſon to go to Calais.
            BItwene Boloygne and Calays are
but ſeuyn or eight leages / and fayre
playne waye. Whan they came nere
to Calais / there ſir Peter of Courtney ſayd
to the lorde of Clary. Sir / we be nowe in the
kyng of Englandes lande / and ye haue well
acquyted you in the conueyaunce of me and
of your company / I thanke you. The lorde
of Clary who had diſpleaſure in his hert / for
the wordes that ſir Peter had ſpoken at Lucenen / 
in the preſens of the counteſſe of ſaynt
Pole and other. Whiche wordes he thought

he wolde nat ſuffre to reſte in that caſe / for he
reputed them to haute and to hyghe agaynſt
the honoure of the chiualry of Fraunce / for
he vnderſtode hym that he ſaid howe he was
come oute of Englande in to Fraunce / to do
armes / and how there were none that wolde
aunſwere hym. Than the lorde of Clary at
their leaue takynge ſayde. Sir Peter / ye be
nowe in the kynge of Englandes lande / and
ſir / I haue conueyed you hyder by the commaundement
of the kynge my maiſter and of
the duke of Burgoyne. And ye remembre
well this laſte daye whan we were in ye counteſſe
of ſaynt Poules chambre / who made vs
good chere. ye ſpake there ouer largely / as
me thynketh / to the great preiudyce & blame
of the knyghtes of Fraunce. For ye ſayde / 
howe ye came fro the kynges courte / & coude
fynde none to do armes with you. By ye whiche
wordes maye be vnderſtande / that there
is no knyght in Fraunce that dare do armes
or iuſt with you / thre courſes with a ſpeare.
Wherfore ſir / I wyll that ye knowe that here
I offre my ſelfe / thoughe I be one of ye mooſt
ſympleſt knyghtes in all Fraunce. And ſaye
and iuſtifye / that the realme of Fraunce is
nat ſo voyde of knyghtes / but that ye ſhall
well fynde yuowe to do dedes of armes with
you. And ſir / if ye lyſte ye ſhall fynde me redy
to aunſwere you / be it incontynente / this
nyght or to morowe. I ſaye nat this for any
hatered that I haue to your perſone. I do it
all onely to maynteyne the honour of our ꝑtie / 
For I wolde nat ye ſhulde retourne to
Calais or in to Englande / to make youre auaunt
that without ſtroke ſtryken / ye ſhulde
diſconfyte the knyghtes of Fraunce. Sir anſwere
me if it pleaſe you to my wordes. Sir
Peter Courtney was ſoone coūſayled what
anſwere to make / and ſayde. Sir of Clary / 
ye ſpeke well / and I accepte your demaunde
And I wyll that to morowe in this ſame place / 
ye be armed at your pleaſure / and I ſhall
be in lyke wiſe. And than lette vs rynne eche
at other thre courſes with a ſpeare / and therby
ye ſhall wynne agayne the honour of the
Frenche courte / and ye ſhall do me a greate
pleaſure. Sir quod the lorde of Clary / I ꝓmyſe
you / I ſhall nat fayle to be here at the
hour ye haue aſſigned. Thus theſe two knightes
promyſed eche other to iuſt. The lorde
of Clary retourned to Marguyſen / & there
prouyded hym of his armure / ſhelde / ſpeare
and horſe. He hadde anone all that he lacked
for on the fronters of Calays and Boloyne
men were ſoone prouyded. There he made
his prouiſyon / as ſhortely as he myght / for
he wolde natte that ouer many ſhulde haue
knowen therof. In lyke manner ſir Peter
Courtney whan̄e he came to Calays / he forgate
nat the promyſe that he had made. But
prouyded hym of good armure / and of euerye
thyng elles. As for harneſſe he had redy / 
ſuche as he had caryed with hym out of Englande
in to Fraunce. As at that tyme ſir Iohan
Bernes was capitayne of Calays. Sir
Peter ſhewed hym the promiſe yt was made
bytwene hym and the lorde of Clary. Than
ſir Iohan Bernes ſayde / howe he wolde accompany
hym thyder / and other good felowes
of Calays. The nexte daye theſe two
knightes came to the place apoynted / the Englyſſhe
knyght came moche better accompanyed
than dyde the Frenche knyght / for the
capitayne of Calays was with hym. Whan
they were come togyder / there was but fewe
wordes bytwene theym. They knewe well
ynough wherfore they were come. they were
bothe well armed and horſed / and toke their
ſheldes. Than they toke their ſpeares with
ſharpe heedes well fyled / and ſpurred their
horſes and ranne toguyder. The fyrſt courſe
they fayled / wherwith they were bothe ſore
diſpleaſed. At the ſeconde iuſte they mette ſo
toguyder / that the lorde of Clary ſtrake the
Englyſſhe knyght throughe the 
                  •
               arge and
throughe the ſhulder a handfull / and therwith
he felle fro his horſe to the erthe. The
Lorde of Clary paſſed forthe and kepte his
courſe and turned and ſtode ſtyll / for he ſawe
well howe the Englyſſhe he knight was vnhorſed / 
& howe that many men were about hym
He thought ſurely than that he was hurt / for
his ſpeare was brokenne in peces: Than he
rode to them. And the Englyſſhe men came
to the lorde of Clary and ſayd. Sir / ye be no
courteſſe iuſter. Wherfore quod the lorde of
Clary. bycauſe ꝙ they ye haue hurt this knightes
ſhulder / ye might more curteſly haue
iuſted. ſirs ꝙ he / that curteſy laye nat in me / 
ſeyng I was apparelled to iuſte / for the ſame
caſe or worſe myght haue fallen to me aſwell
as to hym. Howe be it ſir / I requyre you demaunde
of hym or elles wyll I / whyder he

wyll do any more or 
                  •
               atte. Than ſir Iohan
Bernes ſayde. Nay naye ſir knyght / ye may
departe whan ye lyſte ye haue done ynough.
Than the lorde of Clary departed with his
company / and the Englyſſhe men ledde ſir
Peter Courtney to Calays / to be healed of
his hurtes. And the lorde of Clary retourned
in to Fraunce / thynkynge that he hadde
right well done / and that he ſhulde haue had
for that dede great laude and prayſe / But I
ſhall ſhewe you what fell therof.
            
               WHan tidynges came to the Frenche
kyng and to the duke of burgoyne / 
and to their counſayle:
howe that the lorde of Clarye
had done armes with ſir Peter
Courtney / in retournynge to Calais / ſo that
the ſayde ſir Peter was hurte / and in paryll
of dethe. The kynge and the duke / and ſpecially
ſir Guye of Tremoyle were ſore dyſpleaſed
with the lorde of Clary / and ſayde:
howe he had done (at the leeſt) as moche as
to leſe his landes / and to be bannyſſhed the
realme of Fraunce for euer / without repele.
And ſōe other (ſuche as wolde hym no good
wyll) ſayde: howe he hadde done lyke a falſe
traytoure / ſeynge a ſtraunge knyght vnder
the kynges ſaue garde / ſhulde be requyred
by hym to do dedes of armes / and by yt meanes
to be brought to the ieopardye of dethe.
They ſayde ſuche a dede ought nat to be pardoned.
The lorde of Clary was ſente for: he
came to the kynge and to the duke of Burgoyne.
There he was examyned and layde
to his charge / and demaūded howe he durſte
be ſo outragious to a knyght ſtraunger that
was come to the kynges court for good loue
and to exalte his honoure / to do feates of armes / 
and deꝑted thens with good loue and
ioye. And the entente that he ſhulde nat be
troubled by the way / in his retournyng was
delyuered to hym to conduyt. and than at the
deꝑtynge of bothe realmes / he to be ſo bolde
to do armes with hym in cāpe or iuſtes mortall / 
without lycence of his ſoueraygne lorde
of whom he holdeth his lande. It was ſhewed
hym the treſpaſſe was ſo great / that it
was nat to be pardoned / but to be punyſſhed
ſo highely / that all other ſhulde take enſample
therby. The lorde of Clary whan he herde
thoſe wordes he was abaſſhed / for he thought
he hadde done well / and for to haue had
thanke. Than he ſayde. My lordes / it is of
trouthe / ſir Peter of Courtney was delyuered
to me to conducte and to kepe hym company
tyll he came to Calais / or to the frōters
therof. And of all that I hadde in charge I
haue well and truely acquyted my ſelfe / and
if nede be / I ſhall proue it by the wytneſſe of
hym ſelfe. And trewe it was / that by ye waye
whan we came to Lucyen to the counteſſe of
ſaynt Poule / who receyued & made vs good
chere. There ſir Peter Courtney hadde certayne
wordes / as I ſhall ſhewe you.
            THe counteſſe demaūded of hym and
ſayde. ſir Peter of Courtney. howe
are ye contente with the Lordes of
Fraunce / and with the maner of Fraūce? he
anſwered courteſly and ſayd. Madame / the
maner of Fraunce is ryght noble and goodlye.
As for the lordes of Fraunce I am right
well content with their chere / excepte in one
thyng / and that is with great payne and traueyle
and great coſte / I haue iſſued oute of
Englāde to do dedes of armes / and ſo came
to the frēche kynges court / but there I knew
nat with whom to do armes. Thus my lordes / 
whan I herde hym ſaye ſo in the preſēce
of ſo noble a lady / as the counteſſe of ſaynte
Poule / ſuſter to the kynge of Englande / the
wordes were right heuy to me to beare. how
be it I ſuffred them for that tyme / bycauſe I
had the charge of the conueyaunce of hym.
I neuer made ſemblaunt therof to hym / as
longe as we were in company togider within
the realme of Fraunce. And at our leaue
takynge in the marcheſſe of Calais / trewe it
is / than I layde vnto hym the ſayde wordes
and ſayd / howe they were nat courteſly ſpoken / 
nor honorably. For the wordes ſounded
that the chiualry of Fraunce was ſo abated / 
that none durſt do dedes of armes with him
Than I ſayd if he wolde abyde therby / that
I was one of the knightes of Fraunce borne
of the nacyon. And I ſayd I wolde nat that
he ſhulde make his auaunte in Englande / 
that he coude nat fynde in Fraūce / nor by the
waye / with whome to do armes. Therfore
I ſayde I was redy / and deſyred to do armes
with hym / and to fulfylle his pleaſure
and deſyre / as to rynne thre courſes with a
ſpeare / the ſame daye or the nexte. Certaynly

my lordes / I ſayde theſe wordes for the honour
of the realme of Fraunce / and the chyualry
therof. And me thonght he had great
ioye therof / and accepted to do armes with
me the nexte day and ſo dyde I / and the nexte
day we mette at the ſame place. He was a cō
               panyed
with them of the garyſon of Calais / 
And with me there were certayne of the fronters
there / knyghtes and ſquyers: as ye lorde
of Mount carell and ſir Iohan of Longuyllers.
There we iuſted toguyder as well as
we coude / and the aduenture of armes fell ſo
yt at the ſeconde courſe I ſtrake him through
the ſhulder / ſo that he fell to the erthe. Than
I retourned againe to knowe if he wolde do
any more. Than the capitayne of Calis ſaid
it was ſufiycient that was done / and that I
myght departe whan I lyſt. And than I retourned.
I beleued I had ryght well done / 
and well defended the honour of the realme
of France / and of the knightes therin. Thus
I haue ſhewed you the very trouthe of this
dede / for my well doyng of this amēdes ſhall
folowe / I reporte me and wyll abyde the iugement
of my lorde the Conſtable / and my
lordes the highe marſhalles of Fraūce. And
beſyde that / to the voice and diſcrecion of the
knyght hymſelfe ſir Peter curtney / at whoſe

me to all knyghtes and ſquyers of honour /

enfourmed of the hole mater.

all his wordes and excuſacions / he coude nat
be delyuered / but was cōmytted to priſone. &
there taryed a long ſeaſon in great daunger / 
of leſyng of all his landes / and to be banyſſhed

duke of Burbon / they labored ſore for his delyueraūce / 
and with moche payne they made
his peace / with the ayde of the counteſſe of
ſaynt Puole / before whom the wordes were
ſpoken. Than at his deliueraūce it was ſaid
to hym. Sir of Clary / ye ſuppoſed to haue
done ryght well / howe be it ye dyde ſhamefully / 
whanne ye offred to do armes with ſir
Peter Courtney / who was vnder the kyngꝭ
ſaue garde / and deliuered to you to conducte
to Calays by the kynges cōmaundement. ye
dyde a great outrage / whan ye renewed the
wordes the whiche were ſpoken but in ſport
before the coūteſſe of ſaynt Poule. Or ye had
done it / ye ought to haue returned to ye kyng
and haue ſhewed hym ye wordes that ſhulde

their oppreſſyons do one awaye / wherby the
good people had been ſore traueyled. Than
the kynge toke his leaue of the ladyes and damoſelles / 
and in a mornynge he departed and
wente to dyner to Al
                  •
               pyam / and at nyght lay
at Vbere / the nexte day to Beſyers / where he
was goodly receyued / for the good men of the
towne greatly deſyred to ſe hym / and ſo dyd
all the countreys / bothe of Peſenas / of Cabeſtan / 
and of Narbone / for they were redy to
make complayntes to the kynge of the duke
of Berreys offycer called Betiſache / who had
pylled the countreys. This Betyſach fro that
tyme the kynge came fro Auignon / he rode alwayes
in his company / but no man ſhewed
hym as they thought / for they myght haue gyuen
hym warnynge if they had lyſte / but they
draue hym forthe with fayre wordes / and ſuthe
promyſed hym nothynge but honoure / as
thought the contrary. The kynge entred into
Beſyers bytwene thre & foure at after noone / 
he was met with proceſſyon without ye towne
with all the clergy and burgeſſes / and ladyes
and damoſelles. as the kynge came rydynge
they were a bothe ſydes of the waye / and dyd
their reuerence. So he came to the cathedrall
churche and there alyghted at the dore / where
there was an auter made / rychely garnyſſhed
with iewelles and relykes. There the kynge
kneled downe and dyd his prayers / and than
entred in to the churche with the byſſhoppe of
Beſyers / and his vncle the duke of Burbone
and other lordes folowed after. Thanne the
kynge wente to his lodgynge to the Palyce / 
whiche was nat farre thence / and his brother
the duke of Thourayne and the
duke of Burbone with him / and
the other lordes were lodged
abrode in the
towne / where
as they
were well and eaſely lodged / 
for Beſyers
is a good
cytie.

            ¶Of the complayntes made to the
kyng by the people of Languedoc in
the towne of Beſyers / agaynſt Betyſach
treaſourer to the duke of Berrey
of the great extorſyons that he
had made / and of the confeſſion that
he made / and of the cruell dethe that
he had in the ſayde towne.
Cap. C.lxiii.
            
               THre dayes the kynge
was at Beſyets in greate
ioye and reuell amonge ladyes
and damoſels / and all
that tyme Betyſache was
nothynge ſpoken vnto / but
the enquiſirours who we
                  •
               
ordeyned by the kynge / dyd ſecretly enquyre
of his dedes / and they founde by enqueſt dyuers
caſes horryble / nat to be pardoned. The
fourth day that the kynge had ben there / this
Betyſache was called before the kynges counſayle
in a chambre / and there ſtraytely examyned / 
and it was ſayd to hym. Betyſache / aunſwer
wyſely to theſe writynges that ye ſe here.
There was ſhewed hym a greate nombre of
bylles of complayntes that were put vp to the
kynge agaynſt hym / makyng menſyon of the
errorcyons that he had done to the people. All
theſe bylles of complayntes were redde before
hym one after another. To ſome he aunſwered
wyſely / makynge his excuſe / and to ſome
he playnly denyed them and ſayde. I knowe
nothynge of thoſe maters / laye them to the ſeneſchalles
of Beaucayr and of Carcaſſone / 
and to the chauncellour of Berry / it partayneth
to theym to aunſwere to thoſe matters.
Howe be it fynally it was ſhewed him that he
muſte kepe pryſone for a tyme / tyll the mater
were better examyned. He obeyed bycauſe he
myght nat chuſe. As ſone as he was in priſon
the inquyſitours wente to his lodgynge / and
toke into their handes all ſuche writyngꝭ and
acomptes as they founde there / whiche partayned
to ſuch maters as he had intermedled
with all before / and they auewed them at leyſure / 
and founde in theym the rekenynges of
great ſōmes of money / ſuche as had ben rayſed
and leuyed of the people. Than he was demaunded

where all that money was become
and whether the ſommes were trewe or nat / 
he aunſwered and ſayde / as for the ſōmes are
trewe / and the money delyuered to the duke
of Berrey / and ſo paſte throughe his handes
and his treaſourers / whereof I haue good
quyttaunces in my lodgynge in ſuche a place / 
the whiche quitaūces were ſente for before the
counſayle and there they were redde / and they
agreed with the ſōmes of his receyte. Than
the counſayle and the enquyſytours were apeaſed / 
and Betyſache ſente agayne to a curteſſe
pryſone. Than the counſayle cōmuned
togyther on that matter / and ſayd. It ſemeth
that Betyſache is clere of ſuche cauſes as are
layde to his charge / for the money that hathe
been reyſed / the duke of Berrey hathe had it / 
howe ſo euer it hath ben ſpente.
            ALl thinges conſydred / Betyſache excuſacyons
were lawfull / for the duke
of Berrey was the moſte couetouſe
man in all the worlde / ſo he myght gette good
he cared nat where nor howe he hadde it / and
whan he had it he wolde beſtowe it but ſymply / 
as many lordes do and haue doone in tymes
paſte. Thus the kynges counſayle ſawe
no faute in Betyſache / wherby he ſhulde leſe
his lyfe. ſome were of that opynyon and ſome
contrary / & ſaid. Betyſach hath done ſo many
cruell dedes / and hathe ſo ſore inpoueryſſhed
the people / for to acomplyſſhe the deſyre of his
lorde the duke of Berrey / that the blode of the
poore people cryeth out / and ſayeth / howe he
hathe deſerued dethe. For he that is a manne
borne of theſe partyes / and counſayler with
his maiſter / and ſeynge the pouerty of the people / 
he ought in good maner to haue ſhewed
the trouth to the duke his mayſter / and if the
duke wolde nat haue herde hym / than he ſhulde
haue come to the kynge / and to his counſayle / 
and haue ſhewed theym the pouertie of
the people / and howe the duke of Berrey had
daulte with them / than he had ben well excuſed.
So Betyſache was ſente for agayne to
the counſayle / and ſtraytely examyned where
the money that hadde been gathered was become / 
for they founde the ſōme of thyrty hundred
thouſande frankes receyued. He anſwered
therto and ſayd. My lordes / it were herde
for me to tell where my lorde the duke of Berrey
hathe beſtowed it. Moche he hath layde
out on byldynges and reparacyons of caſtels
and houſes / alſo he hath bought certayne landes
in the countye of Boloygne / and in the
Countye of Eſtampes. Alſo he hathe ſpente
moche in byenge of precyous ſtones and iewelles / 
the whiche ye knowe well he hathe alwayes
been deſyrous to bye. Alſo he is well
ſtuffed to mayntayne the aſtate that he hathe
alwayes kepte. Alſo he hath gyuen ſuche gyftes
and rewardes to Thybaulte and Morynot / 
and to his ſeruaūtes aboute him / in ſuche
wyſe that they be ryche men. Well Betyſache
quod they of the counſayle / and ye haue had
for your parte to your ſynguler profyte a hundred
thouſande frankes. My lordes quod he
that I haue hadde was by the conſente of my
lorde the Duke of Berrey / for he wolde that
his ſeruauntes ſhulde become ryche. Than
the counſayle ſayde all with one voyce. A Betyſach
that worde is folyſſhly ſpoken / that rycheſſe
is nat good nor reſonable that is yuell
gotten / ye ſhall retourne agayne in to priſon / 
and we ſhall take further aduyſe / on that ye
haue ſayd and ſpoken. ye muſt abyde the pleaſure
of the kynge / to whome we ſhall ſhewe all
your excuſacions. My lordes quod he all ſhall
be as god wyll. Than he was agayne ſette in
priſone / and there remayned four dayes or he
was ſente for agayne.
            WHan theſe tydynges were ſpredde abrode
in the countrey that Betyſach
was in priſon / and that inquyre was
made of his dedes / and that it was publyſſhed
that who ſo euer had any matter to hym
ſhulde come forthe. therby moche people came
to Beſyers / and put vp ſupplycacions to the
kynge of the cruell dedes of Betyſach. Some
complayned of hym that he hadde dyſheryted
them without cauſe or reaſon. And other complayned
of hym that he hadde by force taken
their wyues and doughters. Whan the kynges
counſayle ſawe ſo many gret cauſes laide
to Betyſache / they were wery therof. And beſyde
all theſe complayntes he was ſore behated
with the people. And all this came to hym
by reaſon to fyll the duke of Berreys purſe / he
dyd euer what he wolde haue hym to do. The
kynges counſayle wyſte nat what to do / for
than there was come thyder two knightes fro
the duke of Berrey / the lorde of Nantonelet
and ſyr Peter Meſpyn / who had brought letters

to the kynge fro the duke / and they in the
dukes behalfe auowed all that euer Betyſach
had doone before / and the duke requyred the
kynge and his counſayle to haue agayne his
man and treaſourer. The kynge had greate
hatred to Betyſach / bycauſe of the yuell name
and fame that ranne vpon hym. The kynge
and the duke of Thourayne his brother inclyned
greatly to haue had hym hanged / ſayenge
howe he hadde well deſerued it. But the
kynges counſayle durſte nat iudge hym for
dought of the duke of Berrey. They ſayde to
the kynge / ſyr if the duke of Berrey auowe all
his dedes what ſo euer they be / we canne nat
ſe by no waye of reaſon that he hath deſerued
dethe / for the ſeaſone that he medled in theſe
countreys by ceſſynge of tayles / ſubſydyes / 
and aydes / and receyuynge of them / he dyd it
at the inſtaūce of the duke of Berrey who had
at that tyme there puyſſaunce royall / as well
as ye haue nowe. but ſyr / acordynge to the deſertes
of his dedes / ye maye ſeaſe in to your
handes all his mouables and herytages / and
leaue hym in the ſame caſe as the duke of Berrey
founde hym fyrſte / and with his goodes
make reſtytucion to ſuche poore men as be vn
done by hym. What ſhulde I make longe proceſſe / 
Betyſache was at the poynte of his delyueraunce
with the loſſe of his goodes / tyll
at the laſte other tydynges came in place. I
ſhall ſhewe you what.
            I Knewe nat nor I coulde nat knowe but
by knowledgyng of him ſelfe / if he were
in dede ſo yuell as he iudged himſelfe / he ſayd
he was an herytyke and had done many horryble
dedes. As it was ſhewed me there came
ſome to hym on a nyght beynge in priſone to
put hym in feare / whether they were his frendes
or fooes I knowe nat / they ſayde. Betyſach
thou art in a harde caſe / the french kyng / 
his brother / and the duke of Burbone dothe
hate you mortally / there be ſo many complayntes
put vp agaynſte you fro dyuers place / of
ſuche oppreſſyons as ye haue doone whan ye
had rule in Languedoc / ſo that they all iudge
you to be hanged / for ye canne nat ſcape with
the loſſe of your goodes / the whiche hath been
offred to the kynge. But the kynge who hateth
you mortally / hath aunſwered howe that
all your goodes are his / and your body alſo / 
the whiche he ſayeth he wyll nat kepe longe.
I ſhew you this for good wyll / for to morowe
it is thought ye ſhall be delyuered to be iudged
to dye. Thoſe wordes greatly afrayed
Betyſach / and ſayd to them. Ah ſaynt Mary
is there no remedy. yes quod they / to morowe
ſay how ye wolde ſpeke with the kinges counſayle / 
& than outher they wyll come to you or
ſende for you to them / and whan ye be in their
preſence / than ſay thus. My lordes I knowledge
my ſelfe I haue greatly diſpleaſed god / 
and for the diſpleaſure he hath to me / this falſe
ſlaunder is reyſed on me. Than they wyll demaunde
of you wherin. Than ye ſhall aunſwere / 
howe ye haue a longe ſeaſon arred in
your faythe / and that ye be an herytyke / and
kepe ſtyll that opinyon. Whan the byſſhop of
Beſyers ſhall here that / he wyll than chalenge
to haue you in his kepynge / than ye ſhall be delyuered
to hym / for ſuche cauſes ought to be
declared by the lawe of the churche / thanne ye
ſhall be ſente to Auignon / there wyll be none
againſt the duke of Berrey / the pope wyll nat
diſpleaſe hym / and by this meanes ye may be
delyuered / and nother leſe body nor goodes.
But if ye byde ſtyll in the caſe that ye be in / ye
ſhall nat ſkape paſte to morowe / but that ye
ſhall be hanged / for the kynge hateth you bycauſe
of the ſlaunder of the people. Betyſache
who truſted on that falſe infourmacyon / for
he that is in parell of dethe knoweth nat well
what to do / wherfore he aunſwered and ſayd.
ye be my frende and coūſayle me truely / wher
of god thanke you / and I truſt the tyme ſhall
come that I ſhall thanke you. The next mornynge
he called the gayler and ſayde. Frende
I requyre you cauſe ſuche menne and ſuche to
come to ſpeke with me / and named ſuche as
were the enquyſitours ouer him. The gayler
ſhewed theym howe Betyſache wolde ſpeke
with them. They came to hym and demaunded
what he wolde. He aunſwered and ſayd.
Sirs / I haue ſerched my cōſcience / I knowledge
my ſelfe I haue hyghly diſpleaſed god / 
for longe tyme I haue arred agaynſt ye fayth / 
I neuer beleued of the Trinyte / nor that the
ſonne of god wolde come ſo lowe / as to come
fro Heuen to come in to this worlde to take
humayn kynde of a woman. for I beleue and
ſaye / that whan we dye there is nothynge of
the ſowle. Ah ſainte Mary quod they / Betyſach
ye are greatly againſt holy churche / your
wordes demaundeth for a fyre / aduyſe you

better. I canne nat tell quod Betyſache whether
my wordes demaūdeth fyre or water / but
I haue holden this opinyon ſythe I haue had
knowledge / and ſhall holde it tyll I dye. The
enquyſitours wolde here no more of hym at
that tyme / and were gladde to fynde ſuche a
mater againſt hym / therby to put him to deth.
Than they cōmaunded the gailer to kepe him
ſtraytely / and to ſuffre no man to ſpeke with
hym / to the entente that he ſhulde nat be tourned
fro that opynyon. Thanne they wente to
the kynges counſayle and ſhewed them all the
mater / than they wente to the kynge and ſhewed
hym all the maner of Betyſache (as ye
haue herde) wherof the kynge had great marueyle
& ſayd. We wyll that he be put to dethe / 
it is an yuell man / he is a falſe herytyke and a
thefe / we wyll he be brynte and hanged / than
he ſhall haue as he hath deſerued / he ſhall nat
be e
                  •
               cuſed for all myne vncle of Berrey. Anon
theſe tydynges were ſpredde abrode in the cytie
of Beſyers / howe Betyſache hadde of his
owne voluntary wyll without any conſtraynt
confeſſed howe he was an herytyke / and had
vſed longe the ſynne of bowgery / and howe
the kynge had ſayde howe he ſhulde be brynte
and hanged / wherof moche people were right
ioyouſe / for he was ſore hated. the two knyghtes
that were come thyder fro the duke of Berrey
were greatly abaſſhed and wyſt nat what
to ſuppoſe. Than ſyr Peter Meſquyn ſayde
to the lorde of Nantonelet. Syr / I feare me
Betyſache is betrayed / peraduenture ſome
perſone hath ben with hym ſecretly in the priſone / 
and hathe borne hym in hande that if he
holde that horryble erroure / that the churche
than ſhall chalenge hym / and ſo be ſente to Auignon
to the pope / and therby be delyuered.
Ah fole that he is / he is dyſceyued / for the kyng
ſayeth he wyll haue hym bothe brente and hanged.
Lette vs go to the priſone to hym and reforme
hym / and bringe hym to a nother ſtate / 
for he is farre out of the waye and yuell counſayled.
They wente ſtrayte to the priſone / and
deſyred the gayler that they might ſpeke with
Betyſache. The gayler excuſed hymſelfe and
ſayde. Syrs ye muſte pardone me / for I am
ſtraytely charged to ſuffer no manne to ſpeke
with hym / and alſo here be four ſargeauntes
of armes ſente by the kynge to kepe hym / and
we dare nat breke the kinges cōmaundement.
Than the two knyghtes ſawe well howe they
labored in vayne / and howe there was no remedy
by all lykelyhode / but that Betyſache
ſhulde dye. than they retourned to their lodgynge
and rekened and payed / and toke their
horſes and returned to their lorde the duke of
Berrey and ſhewed hym all the caſe.
            THe cōcluſion of Betyſach was ſuche
that the nexte daye 
                  〈◊〉
                tenne of
the clocke he was taken out of pryſone / 
and brought to the byſſhoppes palays / 
and there were redy the iudges and offycers
ſpyrituall / and the bayly of Beſyers brought
forthe the priſoner / and ſayde. Beholde ſyrs
here is Betiſache whome I delyuer to you for
an herytyke and a ſynnet in bo
                  •
               gery / and if
he had nat ben a clerke he had been iudged or
this acordynge to his deſertes. Than the offycyall
demaūded of Betyſach if it were with
hym acordynge as he was acuſed / and to confeſſe
the frouth there openly before all the people.
And Betyſache who thought to haue ſaid
well / and to haue ſcaped by reaſon of his confeſſyon / 
he aunſwered and ſayde that all was
trewe. He was demaunded this thre tymes / 
and at euery tyme he confeſſed it to be trewe
before all the people. Thus ye maye knowe
whether he was dyſceyued or nat / for i
                  •
                he had
made no ſuche confeſſyon he had been delyuered / 
for the duke of Berrey had fully auowed
all his dedes / the whiche he had doone at his
commaundemente in the countrey of Langue
doc. But it was to be ſuppoſed that fortune
played her tourne with hym / for whanne he
thought to haue been moſte aſſuredeſt on the
heyght of fortunes whele / he was tourned vp
ſo downe fro her whele / as ſhe hathe doone a
hundred thouſande mo ſythe the worlde began.
Than Betyſach was delyuered agayne
by the ſpirytuall iudge to the bayly of Beſyers / 
who vnder the kinge ruled the temperalte / 
the whiche Betyſache without delaye was
brought to a place before the palays. He was
ſo haſted forwarde / that he had no leyſure to
aunſwere nor to ſaye nay / For whan he ſawe
a fyre redy prepared in ye place / and ſawe that
he was in the handes of the hangman / he was
ſore abaſſhed / and ſawe well than that he was
dyſceyued and betrayed. Than he cryed out
a loude / requirynge to be herde. but than was
no hede taken to his ſayenge / but the hangeman
ſayde. It is ordeyned that ye ſhall dye / 

for your yuell warkes hathe brought you to
an yuell ende. He was haſted forwarde to his
dethe / and the fyre made redy / there was alſo
reyſed a payre of galowes / and therto tyed a
chayne of yron / and at the ende therof a coler
of yron / the whiche was put aboute his necke / 
and than the chaine drawen vp a hye and tyed
rounde aboute the galowes. Than he cryed
and ſayde. Duke of Berrey they cauſe me to
dye without reaſon / they do me wronge. As
ſone as he was tyed to the galows / there was
ſetre rounde aboute drye ſegge / rede / and 
                  •
               ago
                  ••
               es / 
and fyre put therto / and incontynente
the faggortes were a fyre. Thus Betyſache
was hanged and brente / and the frenche kyng
out of his chaumbre myght well ſe hym if he
wolde. To this poore ende came Betyſache / 
and ſo the people were reuenged of hym. And
for to ſaye the trouthe he had doone many extorcions
and domages to the people / whyle he
had the gouernynge of the countrey of Languedoc.

at Tholouſe ſente for the erle of Foiz
who came thyder and dyd homage
to the kynge for the conntie of Foiz.
Cap. C.lxiiii.
            
               AFter this cruell iuſtyce
the french kyng taryed nat
longe after at Beſiers / but
departed and toke the way
to Carcaſſone. and always
ſythe his departure fro Auygnon / 
his marſhall ſyr
Loys of Xancere rode in his company. The
kynge rode ſo longe by his iourneys that he
vyſited the countreys and kepte nat the right
hyghe wayes. He was at Cabeſtan / at Narbone / 
at Lymons / at Mounte Royall / and at
Fongaur / and than he retourned to Carcaſſone / 
and there taryed foure dayes. Than he
rode and paſſed Vyle Franca / Auygnollet / 
and Mongiſtarte / and ſo came to Tholouſe / 
and the burgeſſes there who greatly deſyred
to ſe the kynge / receyued hym ioyfully / and
mette the kyng without the towne / all in a lyuery / 
and ſo with greate ſolempnyte he was
brought to the caſtell of Thoulouſe. They of
the cytie gaue the kinge many fayre preſentes
wherwith the kynge was greatly reioyſed.
Whan the kynge had been there thre dayes / 
than he was counſayled to ſende for the erle of
Foiz / who was come out of Byerne in to the
countie of Foiz / and was in the towne of Naſiers / 
four leages fro Thoulouſe / for he knew
of the kinges ſtate and ordynaūce. The marſhall
of Fraūce and the lorde de la Ryuer were
apoynted to go for the erle of Foize. They departed
on a wednyſday / and laye at a cytie in
Tholouſyn called Iordayn / and the next day
they came to Naſyers. The erle of Foiz who
knewe well of their comynge receyued theym
nobly for the loue of the Kynge / and alſo he
knewe the lordes well / he had ſene them before
Syr Loys of Xancere had the wordes / and
ſaid. Syr my lorde of Foiz / the kynge our ſoueraygne
lorde hath ſente vs to you / cōmaundyng
you to come to ſe hym at Thoulouſe / or
els he wyll traueyle ſo farre that he wyll come
and ſe you in your owne countrey / for he greatly
deſyreth to ſe you. The erle of Foyze aunſwered
and ſayd. Syr Loys I wolde nat the
kynge had ſo great traueyle to me / it is more
mete I haue it for hym / wherfore if it pleaſe
you ye ſhall ſhewe hym that I ſhall be at Tholouſe
within foure dayes. That is well ſayde
ſyr quod they / we ſhall returne and ſhewe him
theſe tydynges fro you. So be it ꝙ he / howe
be it ye ſhall abyde here all this daye and refreſſhe
your ſelfes / and to morowe ye ſhall departe / 
they obeyed and taryed that daye and
the nyght at their pleaſure / and the erle deuyſed
with theym ſagely & craftely / for he was a
man by reaſon of his fayre langage / to drawe
out by one meanes or other the ſecretes of ons
herte. The nexte daye they toke leaue eche of
other / and rode ſo long that the ſame day they
came to Tholouſe / and founde the kinge playenge
at cheſſe with his vncle the duke of Burbone.
Than the kynge demaunded of them alowde
and ſayde. Syrs howe ſaye you / wyll
the erle come or no. yes ſir quod the lorde de la
Ryuer / he hath gret affection to ſe your grace / 
he wyll be here with you within theſe foure
dayes. Well quod the kynge and we wyll gladly
ſe hym. The two knightes departed fro the
kynge / and lefte hym playeng & went to their
ſupper and to reſte them / for they had rydden

that daye a great iourney. The erle of Foiz
who was at Naſyers / remembred well the
voyage that he had to do. He made hym redy
and ſente before to Tholous for his ꝓuiſyon
acordingly. He had ſent in to Bierne for knightes
and ſquiers / for mo than two hundred
to ſerue and to accompany hym that voiage.
            THe daye that the erle of Foiz had apoynted

of Byerne and ſir Arnolde his two bretherne / 
and his two baſtarde ſonnes / ſir Iobbayne
and ſir Gracyen of Foiz. The entencion
of the erle was to enherite thoſe two his
ſonnes / in to the mooſt parte of all the lande
of Bierne. Of the whiche lande he myght do
therwith at his pleaſure / for he helde it frāke
and free / holdynge of no man but of Godde.
Thus the erle toke his lodgynge at the Freers
preachers. There he kept his houſe / and
his men lay as nere there about as myght be
The burgeſſes of Tholous made him great
chere for they loued him well / for alwayes he
had been their good neyghbour / curteſſe and
tretable: For he neuer ſuffred any of his cō
               pany
to do them any diſpleaſure nor vyolēce
wherfore they loued hym moche the better.
They gaue him many fayre p̄ſentes of wyne
and other thynges / ſo that he was well contente.
He entred in to Tholous whan it was
nere nyght. The nexte daye about ten of the
clocke he toke his horſe / & ſuche other of his
company as pleaſed hym / mo than two hundred
knyghtes and ſquyers men of honour.
And in that eſtate he rode a long through the
ſtretes / to the Caſtell where the kynge was.
Than he a lyghted in the fyrſt court entryng
in to the caſtell. Than the erle moūted vp the
greces in to the great hall. The frēche kyng
was come out of his chambre in to the hall / 
and there taryed for the Erle / and had great
deſyre to ſe hym / for his great valure and renome
that ran on hym. Therle of Foiz who
was a goodly prince and of a formall ſtature
beare heeded entred in to the hall. And whan
he ſawe the kynge and other lordes of Fraū
               ce / 
the kynges brother & his vncle / he made
his reuerence to the kyng and to none other / 
and kneled downe on his one knee. than he a
roſe and paſſed forthe / and at the thirde tyme
he kneled nere to the kynge. The kyng toke
hym by the hande and enbraſed him and toke
hym vp and ſayde. Erle of Foiz my fayre coſyn
ye be right welcome / your cōmyng greatlye
reioyceth vs. Sir quod the erle I thāke
your grace that it pleaſe you to ſay ſo. There
the kynge and the Erle talked toguyder / the
whiche wordes I herde nat all. Than̄e the
kynge went to dyner. At the kynges table at
the vpper ende ſate the archbiſſhop of Tholous / 
than the kynge and his vncle the duke
of Burbone / than nexte the erle of Foiz / than
ſir Iohn̄ of Burbone erle of Marche and of
Vandone. At that table ſate no mo. At the ſeconde
table ſatte ſir Iohan de la Brethe erle
of Harcourte / ſir Philyppe of Bare / & foure
knightes of the erle of Foiz. And at another
table there ſate the marſhall ſir Loyes of ſanxere / 
ſir Roger of Spayne / and eyght other
knightes of the erles. This was a great dyner
and well ſtuffed of all thynges / and after
dyner and grace ſayd / they toke other paſtymes
in a great chābre / and heryng of inſtrumentes / 
wherin the erle of Foiz greatly delyted.
Than̄e wyne and ſpyces was brought.
The erle of Harecourt ſerued the kynge of
his ſpyce plate. And ſir Gerrarde de la pyerſerued
the duke of Burbone. And ſir Monnaunt
of Nonnalles ſerued the erle of Foiz.
Thus about four of the clocke the erle tooke
leaue of the kyng and of the other lordes. He
iſſued out of the hall / and in the courte were
his hourſes redy / and his men. The erle moū
               ted / 
and all ſuche as accompanyed hym / and
ſo retourned to his lodgynge / and was well
contente with the chere that hadde ben made
to hym and his / and prayſed it moche to his
knightes.
            TThus bytwene the Frenche Kynge
and the Erle Gaſcoyne of Foize beynge
at Tholous / There was dyuers treaties

and apoyntmentes of loue / and the marſhall
of Fraunce and the lorde de la Ryuer / 
dyde their payne to helpe it forwarde. The
erle of Foiz made a dyner to the duke of thou
rayne and to the duke of Burbone / to therle
de la Marche / and to other great Lordes of
Fraunce. This dyner was great and ſumptuous / 
and ſyttyng at the tables mo than .ii.
hundred knightes. And or the dyner was fullye
ended / the Frenche kyng who had dyned
in the caſtell / and with hym ſir Charles de la
Brethe and ſir Philyppe of Bare / and his
two coſyn germayns. Than the kyng ſayde.
Go we thyder: and ſo he dyde but with .xii.
in his company. The erle of Foiz was greatlye
reioyſed / in that it pleaſed the kyng to cōe
to his lodgyng / and ſo was all the company.
There was ſporte after dyner of wreſtlyng
and caſtynge the barre / the ſtone & the darte / 
bytwene the Frenche men and the Gaſcoyns
Thus they paſſed the tyme tyll it was nerehande
nyght. Than the kynge and the other
lordes retourned. The erle of Foiz gaue the
ſame daye to the kynges knightes and ſquyers / 
and to ye duke of Thourayne and to the
duke of Burbone / mo thā threſcore courſers
palfrayes and mulettes / all with whyte ſadels
redy dreſt to apoynt. Alſo he gaue to the
kynges mynſtrelles and other / two hundred
crownes of golde. And to the heraudes and
offycers of armes other two hundred crownes / 
ſo that euery man prayſed the larges of
the erle of Foiz. The fourthe daye after the
erle came to the kynges palais / well acompanyed
with lordes and knyghtes of Byerne
and of Foiz / to ſe the kynge and to do as he
was requyred / that is to ſaye / to do his homage
for the countie of Foiz / with the appendauntes / 
reſeruyng the lande of Bierne. Before
that ſecretely there had been great treaties
bytwene the kynge and the erle of Foiz / 
by meanes of the lorde de la Ryuer & ſir Iohan
Mercier / and the byſſhoppe of Noyon / 
who was newly come thyder fro Auygnon.
It was ſayd / that the erle deſyred of ye kyng
that his ſonne Iobbayne of Foiz / myght after
the erles diſceaſe / enheryte the countie of
Foiz. By that the erle whan ſoeuer he dyed / 
ſhulde leaue to the kyng a hūdred thouſande
frankes in money. And ſir Gaſyon his brother
to haue the land of Ayre in Bierne with
the Cytie / and the Mounte of Marcen / and
all other landes that the Erle of Foiz hadde
bought in Bierne / ſhulde retourne to the herytaūce
of the vycount of Caſtyllon. Theſe
aſſygnementes were in debate and in dyfference
bytwene the erle and the barones / and
knightes of his countrey. Some ſayde / he
coude nat do thus with a generall conſent of
all Byerne and Foize. And bycauſe that the
meane homage of the countie of Foize was
dewe to the Frenche kyng / therfore the kyng
ſayde to the Erle and to the barons of Foiz.
Sirs / I holde in my handes the homage of
the lande of Foiz. and if it be ſo in our dayes
that the lande of Foiz be vacant by the dethe
of our coſyn the erle of Foiz / than we ſhall ſo
determyne and apoynt by the aduiſe of good
counſayle / that Iobbayns of Foiz and all other
men of the coūtie of Foiz ſhall holde thē
content. Thoſe wordes well cōtented therle
of Foiz / and the other lordes and knyghtes
of Foiz that were there preſent. Theſe ordynaunces
written and ſealed / the erle toke his
leaue of the kynge and of all other great lordes / 
but that daye he dyned with the kyng &
than went to his lodgyng. The nexte day he
departed fro Tholous and lefte his furriers
behynde hym / to paye for euery thyng. The
erle paſſed the ryuer of Gyronde by ye bridge
of Tholous / and retourned in to his countrey
by the mount of Marſen / and ſo to Ortayes.
Than he gaue leaue to euery man to
departe / ſauyng his ordynarye. It was ſhewed
me and I beleue it well / that the cōmynge
of the frenche kyng in to Lāguedocke / in
to Tholous / & in to thoſe marcheſſe / coſt the
erle of Foize more than threſcore thouſande
frankes. The erle was ſo lyberall / that whatſoeuer
it coſt hym / he payde it wyllyngly.

were ſore diſpleaſed with

beloued. he was buryed in
the churche of ſaynt Peter
and after his obſequy done well and reuerētly.
Than the cardynalles went in to the conclaue
to chuſe a newe pope / and ſo they dyde / 
or that pope Clement knewe therof in Auynon / 
for it was ten dayes paſt or they knewe

knewe therof / they aſſembled togyder

toguyder / and were in great hope
that the buſyneſſe of the churche ſhulde leue
and be concluded / and to come to a full vnyon / 
for the errour had longe endured. They
thought that the cardynals at Rome ſhulde
nat agre ſo ſoone to entre in to conclaue / but
rather to ſubmitte themſelfe to pope Clemēt

that they ſhulde nowe ceaſe / & helpe to
make reſt and peace in ye churche / & to ſhewe
them by his letters / that in our faythe there
ought to be no varyacion. for as there is but
one god in heuyn / ſo ther ought to be but one
god in erthe. The ſame ſeaſon ye duke of burgoyne
was with the kyng at Parys / to whō
pope Clement & the cardynals wrote in lyke
maner. than the kyng ſhewed his vncle theſe
newes / and was right ioyfull & ſaide. Fayre
vncle / we haue had gret deſyre to go wt great

as nowe our iourney is well ſhorted / for Vrbane
the antepape is deed / as Clement hath

wyll nat entre in to cōclaue to chuſe any
newe pope / but rather to come to Auignon &
to ſubmyt thē ſelfes vnder pope Clemēt. and

is deed / but as yet we knowe nothynge
of the ſtate of the cardynals at Rome / nor of
the Romayns / nor whether they wyll kepe
their olde opinyon or nat. I feare it wyll be
harde for them to leaue it / for the Romayns
are mayſters ouer the cardynalles. Byforce
they made them to chuſe the archebyſſhoppe
of Bare / and made hym pope / and ſo maynteyned
hym to thende. And ſo if nowe by ꝑforce
they cauſe the cardynalles to entre in to
conclaue / and to chuſe a Pope at their pleaſure.
Wherfore ſir: ye ſhall nat nede to entre
ſo farre into the mater / as to deſyre them that
wyll do but lytell for you / as they haue ſhewed
yet hydervnto. Suffre ſir tyll ye here

be / that the cardynalles at Rome ſhall nat be
all of one accorde / and paraduēture wyll diſſymule

other pope but Clement. And to apeaſe their
furour to promyſe them / to cauſe Clement to
come to Rome / whiche he wyll do right gladlye
on that condycion. And if the mater go ſo
than ſhall it be tyme for you to write to all ye
princes chriſtned / that are of the opinyon cō
               trarye
to you / in the beſt maner ye canne to a

the mater gothe: it is beſt ye abyde the aduē
               ture

            WHan the duke of Burgoyne hadde
ſayde theſe wordes to the kyng and
to his coūſaile / there was none that
ſpake contrarye therto. The kynge thought
his wordes were reſonable & ſayd. Fayre vncle / 
we beleue it is good reaſon that ye ſaye / 

yeſe more clerer in the mater thā we do / and
as for the buſyneſſe or the Churche / we wyll
do nothynge therin / but by youre counſayle

Great murmuracyon there was a
monge the clerkes of the Vniuerſite of thoſe
tydingꝭ / wherby they ceſſed to rede or to ſtudye.
And entended to nothynge / but to herken
and to knowe howe the Cardynalles of
Rome maynteyned them ſelfe. Wheder they
wolde electe a newe pope / or els to retourne

doughtes and argued one with another.
They knewe well howe Clement had written
to the kynge and to the duke of Thourayne
and to the duke of Burgoyne / and to
the kynges counſayle. In lykewiſe letters
were written generally to the vnyuerſite / yt
they ſhulde conclude to an vnyuerſall peace
in the churche. Thus the clerkes deuyſed amonge

of Clement ſayde. Nowe it is

write to the great princes of Chriſtendome:
As to the kynge of Almaygne / the kynge of
Hungry / the lorde of Myllayne / and to the

humbly written to hym. But whan they cāe
to ſaint Poules they were nat anſwered / the
kynge diſſymuled the mater with thē / ſo that
they were yuell cōtent. Finally the kyng contented
thē / ſayeng howe ſhortely they ſhulde
here other newes / and ſo they dyd / for the cardinals
of Rome entred in to the cōclaue and
made a newe pope / the cardynall or Naples
a noble and a valyant clerke. He was called
Bonyface. Whan the Frenche kyng and his
coūſayle herde therof they were penſyue / for
than they well ymagined howe that ye cyſme
was lykely to endure longe. Than the duke
of Burgoyne ſayde to the kyng. Sir / nowe
regarde wheder your writynges hadde nat

of to betray theſe two knyghtes / and to haue
their money / if any iuell came to them therby
it ought nat to be cōplayned. Vpon this determynacion
they putte out of the caſtell one
of their varlettes / and ſayde to hym. Go thy
waye to the Frēche baſtydes and ſuffre them
to take the. Thā requyre to be brought to ſir
Wyllyam Butler and to ſir Iohan Boeſme
Launce. Than delyuer them this letter fro
vs and demaunde for an anſwere / for the mater
toucheth vs and them alſo greatly. The
varlet ſayd it ſhulde be done / for he thought
none yuell / and ſo went to the Frenche baſtides.
And whan he came nere to the baſtydes
he was demaūded what he wolde / he anſwered
and ſayd he wolde gladly ſpeke with ſir
Wyllyam Butler or with ſir Iohan Boeſme
Laūce. He was brought to them / for as than
they were toguyder. Whan he ſawe them he
made his reuerence and drewe them aparte / 
and delyuered to them the letter that Alayne
and Peter Roux had ſente them. Of that tydinges
they had great marueyle / and ſo toke
the letter and reed it / and therin they founde / 
how that Alayne & Peter Roux wolde ſpeke
with them for their profite. Whan they herde
that they had more marueyle than̄e they had
before / & douted of trayſon. Howe be it they
ſent them worde that if they wolde come out
of the caſtell / and ſpeke with them without / 
they wolde aſſure them to entre agayne in to
their fortreſſe without daunger or trouble.
This was the anſwere yt the varlet brought
to their maiſter. Thanne Alayne and Peter
roux ſaid / we thynke we may be ſure ynough
by theſe wordes / ſythe their faythes and ſeales
be at the writyng / they are true knyghtes
and alſo we ſhall ſpeke with them for a treatie / 
whervnto we thynke they wyll gladly entende.
The nexte mornynge they opynned a
wycket ioynyng to the gate / & aueyled downe
a planche borde hangyng by two chaynes
and iſſued out and ſtode on the planche. than
ſir Wyllyam Butler and ſir Iohan Boeſme
Laūce came thyder and lyghted of their horſes / 
and made their menne to drawe abacke.
Than the two capitayns within ſaid. Sirs
may we ſurely come out and ſpeke with you.
ye ſurely quod the knyghtes. ſhall we be as
ſure agayne of your parte without trayſon.
ye ſir ſurely quod they without doute. Than
Alayne and Peter Roux paſſed the bridge &
came to thē / ſo they four were toguyder with
out other company. Than the two Frenche
knightes ſaid. Sirs / howe ſaye you. What
cōmunycacion wyll ye haue with vs? Are ye
in mynde to yelde vp your Caſtell to vs? ye
truely ſirs quod they on a condycion / & that
is to gyue vs ten thouſande frākes for ye prouiſyons
that is in the caſtell / for we are wery
of ye warre / we wolde drawe in to Bretayne.
Theſe two knyghtes were ryght gladde of
thoſe wordes and ſayd. Ah / ye ſpeke to vs of
marchandyſe / and we ſhall here you gladly.
But as nowe we haue nat here the money redy

we ſhall prouyde for it. Well ſirs ꝙ they of
Vanchador whan ye are redy gyue vs knowledge / 
and we ſhall kepe couenaunt. But ſirs / 
kepe this mater ſecretly and ſagely / for if it
were knowen amonge myne owne company
they wolde take vs perforce and ſlee vs / than
ſhulde bothe you and I fayle of our ententes.
Syr quod they dought nat therof / we ſhall ſo
conuey the mater yt ye ſhall take no domage.
Therwith they departed one fro a nother / the
bretons entred in to Vanchador / and the frenche
knyghtes retourned to their baſtydes.
            
               SIr Willyam Butler and ſyr Iohan
Boeſme laūce / in this mater thought
nothynge but good / ſuppoſynge that
the bretons wolde nat dyſceyue theym / as to
haue their money and to betraye them alſo. in
contynente they wrote to the duke of Berrey / 
who was as than at Ryon in Auuergne. they
ſent with the letter a gentleman named Guyomell
of ſaynte Wydall / and infourmed hym of
all the mater / thynkyng howe it ſhulde be ioyouſe
tydynges to the duke / for he greatly deſyred
to haue that caſtell. This ſquyer tooke
the letter and departed fro the baſtydes / and
rode ſo longe through Lymoſyn & Auuergne
that he came to Ryon / and there he founde the
duke of Berrey / and delyuered hym his letters
fro the two knyghtes. The duke reed the
letters / and whan he had well vnderſtande the
contentes therof the duke was gladde / and anone
after the duke called his counſayle and
his treaſourers / and ſaid. Sirs beholde here
is newe tydynges / our knyghtes that kepeth
the baſtydes before Vanchador haue written
to vs that they are in certayne treatie with the
capytayns within the caſtell / they offer to yeld
vp the fortreſſe for the ſōme of tenne thouſande
frankes / that is no great ſōme for euery yere
it coſte them of Lymoſyn and of Auuergne to
kepe warre againſt them / more than threſcore
thouſande frankes. We wyll accepte their offre
betymes leſte they repente them herafter / 
therfore my treaſourers make vp the ſōme of
tenne thouſande frankes / we wyll lende them
to the countrey / and whan I am in poſſeſſion
of the caſtell I wyll rayſe a tayle in Lymoſyn
and in the fronters / whiche were vnder their
pateſynge / they ſhall pay me the double. Sir
quod the treaſourers / it ſhall be made redy
within theſe fyue or ſyxe dayes. Well quod the
duke I am contente. Thus that matter was
concluded. The treſourers made redy the money
in crownes of the ſonne / and put it in to
foure cofers. The ſame daye that the money
ſhulde haue been ſente / there came to Ryon to
the duke of Berry / the Dolphyn of Auuergne
and the lorde of Reueyll / for certayne maters
touchynge them ſelfe. They were welcome to
the duke / and the Duke was ſo ioyfull of the
treatie for Vanchador that he coude nat kepe
it ſecrete but ſhewed to theſe two knightes the
letters ſente to hym fro ſyr Willyam Butler / 
and ſyr Iohan Boeſme Launce. Whan they
herde it they ſtudyed a lytell. Than the duke
ſayde / ſyr wheron do yemuſe ſe you any ſuſpectiouſnes
in this mater / I pray you ſhewe
me or I ſende the money? Syr quod the erle
Dolphyn / ye know well howe therle of Army
nake and I were ordeyned to by and to gette
agayne as many fortreſſes as we coude in the
coūtreys of Auuergne / Carneſyn / Rouergne / 
and Lymoſyn. With dyuers we made treatyes / 
but for all yt euer we coulde do / we coulde
neuer brynge them of Vanchador to herkyn
or to leane to any maner of treatie / nother to
gyue it vp / nor to ſelle it. Whan we ſpake therof
they wolde ſkante make vs an aunſwere.
and ſyr I knowe if they nowe wyll make this
treatie with you it is nat for defaute of vitayles / 
for if none came to theym this eyght yere
yet they haue ynough / wherfore we haue maruayle
what ſhulde moue them therto at this
preſente tyme / therfore it maketh vs to doute
of trayſone / for men of warre incloſed in fortreſſes
are ſore imagyners / and whan their
imaginacion inclyneth to any yuell dede / they
wyll craftely colour it / wherfore ſir take good
aduyſe. Well ſyrs quod the duke ye haue ſayd
well / we ſhall prouyde for the mater more ſubſtancyally
than I thought to haue done.
            
               THanne the duke of Berrey called to
hym one of his knyghtes / called ſyr
Peter Meſpyn / and ſayde to hym.
Syr ye ſhall go with this money to the baſtydes
before Vanchadore / and ſaye to ſyr Wyllyam
Butler & to ſyr Iohan Boeſme launce / 
that in the mater they wrote to me of / that they
deale therin ſubſtancyally / and that they truſt
nat to moche in the bretons within Vanchador / 
and ſhewe them that we haue herde more
tydinges than they be ware of / wherfore lette

theym be well aduyſed of all poyntes. Thus
this knyght departed fro Ryon with the money / 
he rode with his company tyll he came to
the baſtydes whyther he was welcome. The
ſomers with the money were dyſcharged and
put in ſauegarde. Than ſyr Peter Meſpyn
opened his meſſage and ſaid. Syrs my lorde
the duke of Berrey ſendeth you worde by me
that as touchynge the treatye that ye are in
hande withall / touchyng the garyſon of Vanchador
he cōmaundeth you to worke wyſely / 
that ye leſe nat bothe your bodyes and the money
that he hath ſent you. alſo he ſayth he hath
herde tydynges that pleaſeth hym nothynge / 
wherfore he wyll ye take good hede & be well
aduyſed / for he douteth of trayſon / he ſayeth
that often tymes the coūtrey of Auuergne and
Lymoſyn wolde haue gyuen for the fortreſſe
of Vanchadore threſcore thouſande frankes / 
and nowe to offre it for ten thouſande / cauſeth
my lorde the duke and his counſayle to haue
ſuſpecte. The two knightes whan they herde
that they were penſyue / and aunſwered and
ſayde. We ſe well double wytte is better than
ſyngle / ye ſay well / we thanke you of your aduyſe / 
and ye ſhall abyde here ſtyll with vs and
helpe to counſayle vs as it is reaſon / within
theſe two daies we ſhall ſe howe ye mater ſhall
come to paſſe / he ſayde he was contente ſo to
do. Thanne anone after theſe two knyghtes
ſente a varlet to the caſtell of Vanchador / for
it was as than treuce bytwene the parties / ſignyfyed
to Alayne Rour and to Peter Rour / 
that the tenne thouſande frankes were redy / 
and deſyringe theym to kepe their promeſſe.
And they anſwered the varlet / that they wold
kepe their promeſſe ſurely / and that whan ſo
euer they wolde come / to ſende theym worde
therof.
            ALayne and Peter Rour who thought
no good as it was knowen and ꝓued / 
whan their purpoſe was broken and knowen
for they had deuyſed to haue taken ſir Willyam
Butler and ſyr Iohan Boeſme launce / as
they ſhuld haue entred in to the caſtell of Vanchador
by reaſone of a great towre that was
within the caſtell / the whiche was always able
to beate the caſtell. Theſe two knyghtes
bretons who entended nothynge but maleſſe / 
layde in buſſhement in this towre thyrty men
in harneſſe / to the entent that whan the frenche
men were entred in to the caſtell / thynkynge
to be lordes therof / that in the night theſe thyrty
ſhulde iſſue out / and ſlee & take the frenche
men at their pleaſure. Whan they had thus ordayned / 
than they ſente to ſyr Willyam Butler
and to ſir Iohan Boeſme launce / that they
ſhulde come and bringe with them their money / 
and they ſhulde haue the caſtell opened.
Of theſe newes the frenche men were ioyous / 
and ſayd to the meſſanger. Retourne to your
mayſters and ſhewe them that to morowe in
the mornyng we ſhall come thyder. The meſſanger
retourned and ſhewed this to his mayſters.
The frenche knyghtes wente to counſayle
togyder and dyd caſt more doutes than
they dyd before / by reaſon of the wordes that
the duke of Berrey had ſente them by ſix Peter
Meſpyn. Than they ordeyned and concluded
to lay a buſſhemente of their men nere to
the caſtell / and than they with thyrty of their
men harneſſed vnder couert ſhulde go before
and entre into the caſtell / and to regarde wyſelye
the caſtell within / and to caſt all maner of
doutes / and than if they ſe any thynge to ſuſpecte / 
than one of them to blowe a horne / and
to kepe the bridge and gate open / and at the
ſowne of the horne the buſſhement to come to
the gate as faſte as they canne / and to entre
and take ſeaſon of the caſtell. Thus as it was
ordayned ſo it was done. The next mornyng
euery man was redy / & the buſſhement layde
of a ſyxe ſcore ſpeares / and the two knyghtes
with thyrty in their company couertly armed
came to Vanchador / and ſyr Peter Meſpyn
was with them / with the money truſſed properly
in thre panyers vpon two ſomers. they
founde the two bretons redy at the barryers / 
who opened the barryers agaynſte their comyng.
Whan they were entred and within the
gate / than the two bretons wolde haue cloſed
the gate after them / but the frenche knyghtes
ſaid. Nay ſyrs nat ſo / be ye true marchauntes
or nat / ye knowe well ye muſte yelde vp to vs
this caſtell for the payeng of the ſōme of tenne
thouſande frankes / the which is here redy. ye
maye ſe them here vpon this ſomer / if ye kepe
trouth with vs ſo ſhall we do with yon. With
thoſe wordes Alayne and Peter Rour wyſte
nat what to ſay / but to bringe the frenche men
out of ſuſpecte they aunſwered. Syrs ye ſaye
well / we are contente as ye pleaſe. Thus they
wente forthe and lefte the barryers open / for if

it hadde ben cloſed the buſſhment coulde nat
haue entred to haue come tyme ynough to haue
reſyſted the falſe turne that the bretons had
deuyſed. For ymagyners ſhulde haue euery
thyng as they lyſt / and if there were nat counter
ymaginers agaynſt thē. Bothe the frenche
men and bretons entred in at the gate / than Alayne
and Peter Roux wolde haue cloſed the
gate / but than the frenche men ſayd. Syrs let
the gate alone / we wyll haue it open / it is reaſon / 
we are redy to delyuer you our money acordynge
to our promeſſe. Well ſyrs quod the
bretons / lette ſe laye forthe the money. With a
good wyll quod the frenche men. There they
layde forthe a couerlet / and the florens layde abrode.
In ye meane ſeaſon whyle Alayne and
Peter Roux behelde the fayre ſōme of florēce / 
the frenche knyghtes went aboute to ſe the maner
of the caſtell. Thanne ſyr Peter Meſpyn
came / to ſyr Willyam Butler & ſayd. ſyr cauſe
this great towre to be opened / or ye paye all
your money / for there may be within it a buſſhmente / 
wherby we maye be atrapped and loſe
bothe our bodyes and the money alſo. Than
ſyr Willyam ſayd to Alayne. Syr / open this
towre / we wyll ſe it open or we delyuer our money.
Syr quod Alayne I canne nat do ſo / the
keyes be loſt. With thoſe wordes the frenche
knightes had more ſuſpecte in the mater than
they had before / and ſaid. Alayne it can nat be
that ye ſhulde leſe the keyes of the ſoueraygne
towre of this caſtell / open it with fayreneſſe / or
els we ſhall open it perforce / forye haue promiſed
and ſworne to rendre to vs the caſtell as
it is without fraude or male engyn / and therfore
you to haue ten thouſande frankes / the
whiche ſōme is here redy to be delyuered. than
Alayne aunſwered agayne and ſayd / I wyll
nat open it tyll I haue receyued ye money / and
layde it in ſauegarde. than whan I haue receyued
the money I ſhall ſerche for ye keys. Sirs
quod they / we wyll nat abyde ſo longe / we ſe
clerely by your wordes that your meanyng is
nat good / for you wyll dyſceyue and betraye
vs / wherfore we lay our hādes on you / Alayne
and on your brother Peter / in the name of the
kynge our ſoueraygne lorde and the duke of
Berrey / we wyll haue this towre incontynent
opened perforce / and ſerche euery place within
this caſtell bothe aboue and beneth / to ſe if
ye haue layde any buſſhemente or nat / and if
we fynde in the caſtell any thyng done by you / 
that ought nat to be done / ye are loſte without
redempcyon or pardone / for reaſone wyll ſo / 
and if we fynde the caſtell as it ought to be we
ſhall kepe our bargayne with you well & truely / 
and ſhall conducte you whyder ye lyſte / to
the gates of Auignon if ye wyll. whan Alayne
and Peter Roux ſawe howe the mater wente / 
and that they were areſted they were ſore abaſſhed / 
and were as halfe deed / & repented them
that they had doone ſo moche / for they ſawe
well they were dyſceyued. Than the frenche
knightes perceyued well howe they were culpable / 
and that the mater was nat well. than
they made a ſigne to hym that bare the horne
to blowe / & ſo he dyd. Whan the french buſſhement
herde it / they came to ye caſtell as faſte as
their horſes coulde ryn & ſayd. Go we to Vanchadore
they blowe for vs / it ſemeth our men
hath nat founde the caſtell acording as it was
promyſed / we thynke there be ſome trayſon / anon
they were come to the caſtell / for they were
nat farre of / the barryers were open and kept
by the frenchmen / for the bretons within were
nat mayſters of the caſtell / for their buſſhemente
were within the towre. The Frenche
men entred and founde the capytaynes in the
courte comunynge with the bretons.
            
               THan Alayne and Peter were ſore abaſſhed / 
ſeynge ſo many of their enemyes
aboute them. And as for them
that were within the towre knewe nothynge
of the beſyneſſe / nor coude ſe nor here nothyng
the towre was ſo thycke. ſome that were with
in ſayde. Harke ſyrs me thynke I here moche
murmurynge without / we may be dyſceyued
frenche men be ſubtyle / we thought to take / 
but I feare we be taken / our capitayn Alayne
is dyſceyued and we to / I feare we ſhall nat
iſſue out without their congye. Thus whan
the frenche men ſawe howe they were lordes
of the caſtell / they were than bolder than before / 
and tooke and put vp agayne their floreyns / 
& ſayd to Alayne. delyuer vs the keyes
of this towre / for we wyll ſe what is within.
The bretons prolonged the mater and ſayde.
Syrs begynne fyrſte to ſerche in outher places
and thā returne to this towre. The frenchmen
anſwered. Alayne / ye do but prolōge the mater / 
for we wyll begynne here fyrſt. and other
at ones delyuer the keyes or els thou ſhalte be
ſlayne with theſe daggers. whan the two bretherne

herde that they douted the dethe / they
fledde fro it as longe as they myght / howe be
it to ſaye the trouth it had been more honorable
for them to haue been ſlayne there than to
haue taryed any longer / for afterwarde they
dyed a ſhamefull dethe / as ye ſhall here. And
Alayne Roux beyng in this daunger yet practyſed
another crafte if it wolde haue ſerued / 
and ſayd. Syr Willyam and you ſyr Iohan / 
it is of trouth that within this toure are thirty
men in harneſſe / my brother and I dyd ſette
them there with moche payne / for we knewe
well they wolde neuer agree to our apoyntemente / 
therfore we haue cloſed theym within
this towre to be ſure of them / tyll ye haue the
full poſſeſſyon of the caſtell and there ye may
haue them and ye wyll / they are all good priſoners / 
and delyuer vs our money as ye haue
promyſed / and lette vs go our wayes. Whan
the french knightes herde that they were ſomwhat
better content than they were before and
ſtudyed a lyttell / than ſir Willm̄ Butler ſaide / 
how ſo euer it be / or we delyuer our money we
wyll haue knowledge of all the keyes of this
caſtell / therfore ſhew vs where they be. Whan
Alayne ſawe it wolde be none otherwyſe / he
ſente for them in to his chambre. Whan they
were brought to the place than it was demaū
               ded
whiche keyes ſerued for ye towre. Alayne
full ſore agaynſte his wyll ſhewed forthe the
keyes of the great towre. Than they opened
the towre / and founde within the thyrty companions
in harneſſe hydde priuely within the
towre. Alayne and his brother were ſore abaſſhed
whan they ſawe the frenchmen entre into
the towre / and harde the wordes that ſir Willyam
Butler ſayd / whiche were theſe. Syrs / 
iſſue out fayre & eaſely one by one / if nat ye are
all but deed / we take you as priſoners / feare
nat the dethe ye ſhall haue no hurte / ſo ye wyll
ſhewe the trouth of that we ſhall demaunde of
you. Whan they ſawe the frenche men and vnderſtode
that they ſhulde nat be ſlayne but taken
as priſoners / they layde downe their weapons
and harneſſe / and yelded them ſelfes / for
they ſawe well defēce coulde nat aueyle them.
There the thyrty men were taken and put a
parte and examyned / and there they iuſtyfyed
the trayſon before Alayne and Peter Roux / 
who coulde nat denye it. Than the knyghtes
of Fraunce ſayde to them. Syrs / it greatly
dyſpleaſeth vs to fynde you in this defaulte / 
we canne nat punyſſhe the mater the cauſe is
ſo weighty / we ſhall put it to the diſcrecyon of
the duke of Berrey / if he wyll haue pytie on
you we ſhall be gladde therof / we truſt he wyll
for the ioye that he wyll haue for the recoueryng
of this caſtell / for it was the place that he
moſt deſyred to haue agayne of all the world.
Theſe wordes ſomewhat comforted theym.
They were put in to a chambre vnder ſure kepynge / 
and other in to dyuers chambres and
towres. Than the caſtell was ſerched aboue
and beneth / there they founde great prouyſyon / 
and lefte it all there ſtyll and toke away nothynge
therof at their departynge / and as for
golde / ſyluer / and harneſſe / therof was made
a boty & euery man had his parte / and the priſoners
the knyghtes had them for their parte.
            
               THus as I haue ſhewed / the ſtronge
caſtell of Vanchadore was taken by
the frenche men in this ſeaſon. And
than ſyr Wyllyam Butler ſette there a capytayne
a ſquyer of Lymoſyn a valyaunt man / 
called Pier Mardych / and with hym a thyrty
ſpeares of good men of warre / and they raunſomed
their pryſoners ſuche as were worthy
to be raunſomed / and ſuche as were great pyllers
and robbers / and frenchmen borne / they
ſtrake of their hedes / and hanged them vpon
gybettes / newe made before the caſtell gate.
Than the frenche knightes departed to go to
Ryon to the duke of Berrey / & toke with them
Alayne and Peter Roux. Tydinges ſprange
abrode howe the ſtronge caſtell of Vanchadore
was taken / wherof the countrey of Auuergne
and Lymoſyn & thoſe marcheſſe were
greatly reioyſed / for the caſtell had been out of
the frenche mennes handes more than fyftene
yere / and durynge that ſeaſon that garyſone
had done great domage to the countrey. Sir
Willyam Butler founde in the caſtell a yonge
ſquier of Bretayne / a fayre yong man named
Monadich / and was coſyn to Geffray Tetenoyre / 
and he was but newely come thyder to
lerne to exercyſe dedes of armes. He had ben
brought vp in an abbaye in Bretayne / & was
come out of the houſe bycauſe he wolde be no
monke. The frenche men wolde haue ſtryken
of his heed among other / but ſir Willm̄ Butler
had pytie on hym and ſaued his lyfe / with
that he wolde become frenche and ſerue hym.
Thus the frenchmen rode to the duke of Berrey / 

and brake vp their baſtydes. The men of
armes departed and went euery man to their
owne / and ye capytaynes came to Ryon to the
duke of Berrey / & led with them the bretons / 
who deſyred thē on the waye yt they ſhulde nat
enfourme the duke of Berrey to ſore agaynſt
them. the frenchmen promyſed to fulfyll their
deſyre. So longe they rode that they came to
Ryon / and there founde the duke and the ducheſſe / 
who receyued them with great ioy / for
he rekened it to be a gret acte / the conquering
of the caſtell of Vanchadore / and gaue them
fayre gyftes & preſentes. Than they demaunded
of the duke what his pleaſure was ſhulde
be done with Alayne and Peter Roux. he anſwered
he wolde take aduyſe in that matter / 
and ſo toke counſayle / and there it was determyned
that he ſhulde ſende them to the kyng.
And ſo they were delyuered to the ſeneſchall
of Auuergne / and he cōueyed them to Parys / 
and there they were put in priſon in the caſtell
of ſaynte Anthony / in the kepynge of the vycount
of Affer / who as at that tyme had the kepynge
of yt caſtell. And they had nat ben longe
there but that they were delyuered to the prouoſt
of Parys / and put in to the chatellet and
there iudged to dye as traytours and robbers
of the realme of Fraunce. Than they were delyuered
to the hangman and faſt bounde and
layde in a carre and brought with trompettes
to the place of execucion named ye halles / and
there ſet on the pillery and turned four tymes
aboute in the ſyght of all the people / and there
was openly red and publyſſhed all their dedes / 
and thā beheeded and quartered / & their
quarters ſent to the four chefe gates of the cytie.
Thus Alayne and Peter Rour loſt ſhamfully
their lyues / & the caſtell of Vanchadore.

receyued great domage / ſo yt the complaintes
therof came to Parys. Than the french kyng
was counſayled to ſende to the kynge of Englande / 
ſignyfyenge hym of the ſtate of theſe
robbes that made warre thus in the countrey
vnder coloure of their pateſynge / the which
ought nat to be done. I thinke the king of Englande
excuſed hym ſelfe of the mater. And to
prouyde therfore. the ſame / ſeaſon the thre fore

Raynolde of Roy / & the lorde of ſaint
Pye / who had enterpriſed to do armes about
the marches of Calays / nere to ſaynte Ingilbertes / 
made them redy to a cōplyſſhe their deſyre
& to fulfyll their promeſſe & the right of armes / 
for it was openly declared & publyſſhed / 
and ſpecyally in ye realme of Englande / in the
which realme there were knyghtes & ſquyers
quyckened to the mater / and were in gret imagynaciōs
to knowe what they might beſt do.
Some ſaid it ſhuld be greatly to their blame
and reproche / ſuch an enterpriſe taken ſo nere
to Calays without they paſſed the ſee / & loke
on thoſe knightes that ſhulde do armes there.
Suche as ſpake moſt of the mater was / firſt

Let vs prouyde to go to Calays / for the knightes
of Fraunce hath nat ordayned that ſporte
ſo nere our marches / but to the entent to ſe vs

lyke good companions / and we ſhall nat fayle

abrode in Englande / that many ſuche
as had no deſyre to do dedes of armes theym
ſelfe / yet they ſayd they wolde be there to loke
on them that ſhulde. Suche as thought to be
there ſent afore to Calays to make prouyſion

to kepe their aſtate / and ſente ouer their horſe
and harnes bothe for peace and warre. Whan
the day aproched ſir Iohn̄ Holāde brother to
the kyng of Englāde fyrſt paſſed the ſee / & mo
than .lx. knightes & ſquiers with hym / & aryued
at Calys & there toke vp their lodgyngꝭ.
            At thentryng in of ye ioly freſſhe moueth of

thus firſt they cāe to Boloyne & taryed

were a great nōbre of knyghtes & ſquyers cōe

ryght ioyfull. And to the entent that the brute
ſhulde cōe to Calays / they ordayned in a fayre
playne bytwene Calays and ſaynt Ingilbertes
thre freſſh grene pauilyōs to be pyght vp / 
and at the entre of euery pauylyon there hanged
two ſheldes with the armes of the knightes / 
one ſhelde of peace another of warre / and
it was ordayned that ſuche as ſhulde ryn & do
dedes of armes / ſhulde touche one of the ſheldes / 
or cauſe to be touched / whiche as pleaſeth
them / and he ſhulde be delyuered acordyng to
his deſyre. to ſpeke of this mater I ſhall ſhew
you. The .xxi. day of the moneth of May acordyng
as it had ben publiſſhed / theſe thre frēch
knyghtes were redy in the place to furnyſſhe
their interprice. And the ſame day knightes &
ſquyers iſſued out of Calays ſuche as wolde
iuſt / and alſo ſuche other as had pleaſure to regarde
that ſporte / and they came to the ſayde
place apoynted and drewe all on ye one parte.
The place to iuſt in was farre grene & playne.
Syr Iohan Holande firſt ſente to touche the
ſheld of warre of ſir Boucyquant / who incontynent
iſſued out of his pauylyon redy mounted
with ſhelde & ſpeare. Theſe two knightes
drewe fro other a certayne ſpace / and whan
eche of them had well aduyſed other they ſpurred
their horſes & came togyther rudely / and
Boucyquante ſtrake the erle of Huntyngton
through the ſhelde / and the ſpearcheed glente
ouer his arme & dyd hym no hurt / and ſo they
paſſed forthe / and tourned and reſted at their
paſe. This courſe was greatly prayſed. The
ſeconde courſe they met without any hurte do
ynge / and the thyrde courſe their horſes refuſed
and wolde nat cope. The erle of Huntyngton
who had gret deſyre to iuſt and was ſomwhat
chafed came to his place / abydynge that
ſir Boucyquant ſhulde take his ſpeare / but he
dyd nat / for he ſhewed that he wolde no more
tynne that day agaynſt therle. And whan the
erle ſawe that / he ſent his ſquyer to touche the
ſhelde of warre of the lorde of ſaynt Pye. And
he that wolde nat refuſe iſſued out of his pauylion / 
and toke his horſe / ſhelde / and ſpeare.
And whan the erle ſawe that he was redy ſpurred
his horſe / and ſaynt Pye in lykewyſe / they
couched their ſpeares / but at the metyng their
horſes croſſed / but with the croſſynge of their

with their ſpeares in the myddes of their ſheldes / 
ſo that nere hande they were bothe borne
downe to their erthe / but they gryped faſt their
horſes with their legges / and ſo ſaued them
ſelfes / and retourned to their places / and toke
their brethes. Syr Iohan Holande who had
great affection to do honorably / toke agayne
his ſpeare & ſpurred his horſe / and whan the
lorde of ſaynt Pye ſawe hym comyng he daſſhed
forth his horſe to encountre hym / eche of
them ſtrake other on their helmes that ye ſpre
flaſſhed out. With yt ataynt the lorde of ſaynt
Pye was vnhelmed / and ſo they paſſed forthe
and came agayne to their owne places. This
courſe was greatly prayſed / and both frenche
and englyſſhe ſayd that thoſe thre knyghtes / 
the erle of Huntyngton / ſir Bouciquant / and
the lorde of ſaynte Pye / had ryght well done
their deuoyrs without any domage eyther to
other. Agayne the erle deſyred for loue of his
lady to haue another courſe / but he was refuſed.
Than ſir Iohan Holand went out of the
renke to gyue place to other / for he had ronne
all his ſire courſes well and valyaūtly / ſo that
he had laude & honoure of all partyes. Than
ſtept forth a gentle knight of Englāde called
the erle Marſhall / he ſent to touche the ſhelde
of warre of ſir Raynolde of Roy / who iſſued
out of his pauylyon armed at all peces / and
toke his horſe / ſhelde / and ſpeare. And whan
theſe two knyghtes were a ſonder they ſpurred
their horſes & came fyerſly togyther. The
firſt courſe they fayled by outragyng of their

            ¶Of the enterpryſe and voyage of
the knyghtes of Fraunce and Englande / 
and of the duke of Burbone
who was chefe of that army / at the
requeſte of the genouoys / to go in to
Barbary to beſiege the ſtrong towne
of Auffryke. Cap. C.lxix.
            
               I Shall nowe declare
the maner of an hygh and
noble enterpriſe that was
done in this ſeaſō by knightes
of Fraūce / of England /
& of other countreys / in the
realme of Barbary. Syth
I haue concluded the armes that was doone
at ſaynt Ingylbertes / nowe wyll I ſhewe of
other maters / for to me it is great pleaſure to
declare them / for if pleaſure had nat inclyned
me to write and to enquyre for the trouthe of
many matters / I had neuer come to an ende
as I haue done. Nowe ſayeth the texte of the
mater that I wyll procede on / yt in this ſeaſon
newes ſpredde abrode in Fraunce and in dyuers
other coūtreys that the genouoys wolde
make an army to go in to Barbary with gret
prouyſion / as well of byſquet as freſſhe water
and wyneger / with gales and veſſelles for all
knyghtes and ſquyers that wolde go in that
voyage. the cauſe that moued them thus to do
I ſhall ſhewe you. Of alonge tyme the affrycans
had made warre by ſee on the fronters of
the genouoys / and pylled and robbed their
Ilandes / ſuche as were obeyſant to them / and
alſo the ryuer of Genes lay euer in parell and
daunger of them of Auffryke / whiche was a
ſtronge towne on ye parties / garnyſſhed with
gates / towres / and hyghe and thycke walles / 
depe dykes. And lyke as the ſtronge towne of
Calays is the key wherby who ſoeuer is lord
therof may entre into the realme of Fraunce / 
or in to Flaunders at his pleaſure / and maye
by ſee or by lande ſodenly inuade with great
puyſſaunce / & do many great feates. In lyke
wyſe by comparyſon this towne of Auffryke
is the key of the barbaryns and of the realme
of Auffryke / and of the realmes of Bougne / 
and Thunes / and of other realmes of the infydeles
in thoſe parties. This towne dyd moch
dyſpleaſure to the genouoys / who are greate

marchauntes / and by them of Aufryke they
were often tymes taken on ye ſee / as they went
or returned fro their feate of marchaundyſes.
Than the genouoys who were ryche & puyſſaunt
bothe by lande and by ſee / hauyng great
ſygnories / they regarded the dedes of the affrycans / 
and alſo conſydred the complayntes
of ſuche iſles as were vnder their obeyſaunce / 
as the iſle Dable the iſle of Syre / the iſle of
Guerſe / the iſle of Boſtan / the iſle of Gorgennem / 
and vnto ye Gulfe of Lyon / & to the iſles
of Sardonne and Finiſſe / and vnto the iſle of
Mayllorke / whiche thre iſles be vnder the obeyſaunce
of the kynge of Aragon. Than the
genouoys by comon acorde agreed to ſende in
to the frenche courte / and to offre to all knightes
and ſquiers that wolde go with them to be
ſiege this towne of Aufryke / to fynde them galees / 
and other veſſels charged with byſquet / 
ſwete water / and wyneger / at their coſte and
charge / ſo that one of the frenche kynges vncles
or els his brother the duke of Thourayn / 
who was yonge and luſty / and lykely to conquere
honour / ſhulde be capytayne generall.
And the genouoys furthermore promiſed .xii.
thouſande croſbowes genouoys well furnyſſhed / 
and eyght thouſande of other with ſpeares
and paueſſes / at their coſt & charge. This
the genouoys dyde bycauſe they knewe that
there was a trewce bytwene Englande and
Fraunce for thre yere / wherfore they ſuppoſed
that knyghtes and īquyers as well of Fraūce
as of Englande / wolde be glad to be doynge
in ſome parte.
            WHan tydynges came firſt into Fraūce
of this voyage / the knightes and ſquiers
of the countrey were right ioyfull / 
and the meſſangers fro Genne were aunſwered
that they ſhulde nat departe tyll they were
well herde and ſo to haue ſocour / their requeſt
was ſo reaſonable / as to the augmentynge of
the cryſten faythe. Thus they were cauſed to
tary a ſeaſon at Parys. There to debate that
mater / and to ſe who ſhulde be chefe ſoueraygne
of the armye for that voyage / and to whome
euery man ſhulde obey. The duke of Thourayne
of his owne volūtary wyll / offred hym
ſelfe to go. but the kyng and his vncles wolde
in no wyſe agree therto / ſayenge howe it was
no voyage for hym / and they conſydred well
howe yt genouoys deſyred outher to haue him
or els one of the kynges vncles. Than it was
agreed that the duke of Burbone vncle to the
kynge ſhulde be ſouerayne and chefe of that
armye / & ſhulde haue in his company the lorde
of Coucy. Whan the ambaſſadours of Gene
were aunſwered that it was concluded without
fayle yt they ſhulde haue ayde of knightes
and ſquyers of Fraunce / and the kynges vncle
the duke of Burbone to be ſouerayne and
chefe capytayne / wherof theſe ambaſſadours
were well contente / and toke their leaue of the
kynge and of his counſayle / and retourned in
to their owne coūtrey. Tydinges anon ſpred
abrode in yt realme of Fraunce af this voyage
into Barbary. To ſome it was pleſaunt / and
to ſome nat delectable / and many that wolde
haue gone wente nat. There was none that
went but on their owne charge and coſte. No
lorde ſente any but of their owne ſeruauntes.
Alſo it was ordeyned that none ſhuld paſſe of
the nacyon of Fraunce / without lycence of the
kynge / for the kynge wolde nat that ſo many
ſhulde haue gone to leaue the realme deſtitute
of knyghtes and ſquyers. Alſo it was agreed
that no varlettes ſhulde paſſe / but all gentle / 
men / and men of feate & defence. Alſo to pleaſe
all other nacyons / knyghtes & ſquiers ſtraungers
had fre lyberty to come and to entre into
this honorable voyage / wherof all knyghtes
ſtraungers greatly prayſed the frenche kynge
and his counſayle for that dede. The duke of
Burbone who was one of the chefe of the realme / 
ſent incontynent his officers to Gennes
to make prouyſyon acordynge to his aſtate.
The gentle erle of Auuergne ſent alſo to Gennes
to make his prouyſions / and the lorde of
Coucy was nat behynde. Alſo ſyr Guy de la
Tremoyle / and ſir Iohan of Vyen admyrall
of Fraunce / and all other lordes and knightes
ſuche as were ordeyned to go in that voyage / 
ſent to make their prouyſions / euery man after
his degre. Alſo ſo dyd ſir Philyppe de Arthoys
erle of Eawe / and ſir Phylip of Bare / 
the lorde of Harcourt / ſir Henry Dantoinge.
Alſo out of Bretayne and Normandy many
lordes & other aparelled them ſelfes to go into
Barbary. Alſo of Haynalt the lorde of Ligne / 
the lord of Haureth / and for thē of Flaunders
there was great ꝓuyſion made. Alſo the duke
of Lācaſtre had a baſtard ſonne called Henry
of Lancaſtre / he had deuocion to go in ye ſame
voyage / & he prouyded him of good knightes

and ſquyers of Englande / that acompanyed
hym in that voyage. The erle of Foiz ſent his
baſtarde ſonne called Iobbayne of Foiz / well
prouyded with knightes & ſquiers of Bierne.
Euery man prouyded them ſelfes nobly and
eche for other / and about the myddes of May
the yt were furtheſt of fro Gene ſet forwarde
to come to Gennes / whereas ye aſſemble was
apoynted / and where as all their galees and
veſſelles were aſſembled. It was a moneth or
they coude all aſſemble there. The genouoys
were right ioyfull of their comyng / and gaue
great preſentes to the chiefe lordes / the better
therby to wynne their loues. They were nombred
whan they were togyther by ye marſhals
xiiii. hundred knyghtes and ſquyers. Than
they entred in to the galees and veſſelles that
were prouyded for them / well furniſſhed of all
thynges neceſſary. Thus they departed fro
the porte of Gennes aboute the feeſt of mydſomer / 
in the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and ten.
            GReat pleaſure it was to behold their
departynge and to ſe their ſtandardes / 
getorns / and penons wanynge
in the wynde and ſhynynge againſt the ſonne / 
and to here ye trompettes & claryons ſownyng
in the ayre / with other mynſtrelſy. The fyrſte
night they lay at ancre at the entryng in to the
high ſee. all varlettes & horſes abode behynde / 
a horſe that was worthe fyfty frankes at their
departyng was ſolde for ten frankes / for there
were many knyghtes and ſquiers that wyſte
nat whan they ſhulde returne. they coulde nat
haue fyue horſes kept at Gennes for a franke
a daye / and therfore at their departynge they
made money of them / and that was but lytell.
There were a hūdred galees garniſſhed with
men of warre / croſbowes / & paueſſes / and mo
than a .C. of other veſſels laden with ꝓuyſion
& other neceſſaryes. The next day at the breke
of the daye they weyed ancres / and rowed all
that day by force of owers and the nyght folowynge / 
coſtyng the lāde. The thyrde day they
came to Portefyn / and there caſt ancre / and taryed
there all that night / and the next day they
came to another porte & towne called the porte
Vēder / and there taryed and refreſſhed them.
The next day they paſſed further into the gret
ſee in the name of god & our lady / and ſaynte
George / & firſte they founde the iſle of Dable / 
and than yt iſle of Guerfe / the iſle of Argenen / 
and the iſle of Sardyns / & paſſed the Gulfe of
the Lyon / which was a daungerous & a doutfull
paſſage / but they coulde nat eſchewe it the
waye yt they toke / they were there in great parell
all to haue ben loſt. the ſeaſon was ſo troublus
& tempeſtes ſo terryble / that ye wyſeſt maryner
yt there was coulde gyue no coūſaile but
to abyde the aduēture / & the wyll of god / wherby
the flete departed a ſonder ſome here and
ſome there / they wyſt neuer where. This tempeſt
endured a day & a night. whan this tēpeſt
was ſeſt / and ye wyndes pacifyed / than the patrons
& pylottes ſet their courſes to drawe to
the iſle of Cōmeres / a .xxx. myle fro Auffryke.
and fro the towne thyder as they entented to
go. For at the goynge out of the Gulfe of Lyon / 
the patrones ſayde one to a nother / if it
fortune that we be driuen a ſonder by force of
wynde and wether / than lette vs drawe to the
iſle of Cōmeres / and there lette vs tary eche
for other. And as they hadde deuyſed ſo they
dyd / for the fyrſt that came thyder taryed tyll
the laſt came / and or all coulde aſſemble there
togyder it was a nyne daies. This iſle of Cō
               meres
is a pleaſaūt iſle / thought it be nat gret.
There the lordes refreſſhed theym and thanked
god / whhan they ſawe they had loſte none
of their company. Thanne the lordes and patrons
toke counſayle what was beſt for them
to do / conſyderinge they were ſo nere ye towne
of Aufryke.
            ¶Nowe I wyll leaue to ſpeke of theſe lordes
of Fraunce for a ſeaſon / and ſpeke of other maters
that was done in that ſeaſon in Fraūcel
and ſpecyally in the countrey of Auuergne / in

who was forthe in the ſayd voyage.

            ¶Of a capytayne a robber and a pyller
of the countrey / called Aymergot
Marcell / who helde a ſtronge caſtell
in the marches of Rouergne called
the Roche of Vandois / and howe it
was beſieged by the vicount of Meaulx / 
and of the takynge therof / and
howe Aymerygotte was taken and
brought to Parys. Cap. C.lxx.
            
            
               IN this ſeaſon whyle
this aſſēble was a making
to go in to Barbary for a
good entente / as to exalte
the criſten faythe / certayne
robbers and pyllers in Auuergne / 
& Rouergne / and
in Lymoſyn / were of contrary myndes / for
though the coūtreis thought themſelfe in ſuretie / 
by reaſon of the chartre of the treuce that
was taken bytwene Englande and Fraunce / 
whiche had ben ꝓclaymed and publyſſhed in
all fortreſſes / and before all the capitayns that
made any warre / or helde any fortreſſes of the
engliſſh parte. And an artycle there was / that
who ſo euer brake or violated any poynt or artycle
compriſed in the treaty ſhuld receyue punyſſyon
of dethe / without hope of any remyſſion / 
& ſpecially Perot le Bernoys capytayne
of Caluſet / Amergot Marcell / Olyue Barbe
capytayne of Douſac / in the marches of Auuergne / 
were encloſed by name in the charter
of the treuſe / to the entent that if they or any of
theirs dyd or conſented to do any thynge contrary / 
yt they ſhulde nat ercuſe them ſelfe. ſome
of the capytayns that feared to dye a ſhamfull
dethe / or to rynne in to the indygnacion of the
frenche kynge / helde ſurely all the poyntes of
the charter. But ſome dyd nat ſo whiche they
derely bought / as ye ſhall here after.
            ye ſhall knowe as it hath ben here before reherſed / 
howe Iohan erle of Armynake & Bernarde
dolphyn of Auuergne / and therle Clermounte / 
were in treatie with certayne capytayns
that helde fortreſſes in the ſaid coūtreys
agaynſt the frenche kynge. Theſe ſayd lordes
made ſuche dylygence that they brought dyuers
of theſe capytayns to compoſycion / and
to the ſellyng of their fortreſſes. Their treaty
and compoſicyon was yt they ſhulde renounce
the warre bytwene Englande & Fraunce / and
durynge the treuce they to go with the erle of
Armynake in to Lombardy / or whyder as he
wolde leade them / to ayde hym in his warre a
gaynſt the lorde Galeas erle of Vertues / who
had diſheryted his coſyn germayns / chyldren
to his vncle the lorde Barnabo / as it hath ben
ſhewed here before / and ſo what to haue their
ayde and to auoyde the countrey of theſe robbers
& pyllers (who had done ſo moche hurte
in the countrey / bothe to men and women) the
ſayd erle of Armynake / and the erle Dolphyn
his coſyn / toke gret payne in that mater. And
at the inſtant requeſtes & prayers of the good
menne of the cyties and townes of the playne
countreys aforeſayd / ſo that there was a tayle
gadred in Auuergne / Guynaldan / Rouergne
Carnoſyn / and in Lymoſyn / to ye ſōme of two
hundred thouſande frankes / ſo that poore and
riche payed ſomoch / that dyuers ſolde & layde
to pledge their herytages / and were glad ſo to
do to lyue at reſte in their countreys. And the
good men thought by reſon of payeng of this
money / and aduoydyng of the ſayd fyue robbers
& pyllers / that they ſhulde than haue ben
quyte for euer of them / but it proued nat ſo in
dyuers places / & ſpecially of Aymergot Marcell
and of his men. For after that the caſtell of
Aloys was yelden vp and ſolde by Aymergot
Marcell to the erle of Armynake / whiche fortreſſe
ſtode in the herte of all Auuergne / this
Aymergot was well worthe in redy money a
hūdred thouſande frankes / whiche he had goten
by robory & pyllage / and by raunſominge
of men / and pateſynge of the countrey / and he
had kept ye rule more than ten yere. Therle of
Armynake deſyred gretly to haue in his company
the ſayd Aymergot Mercell & thought
nat to leaue him behynd him for two reaſons.
One was / bycauſe he wolde gladly haue the
counſayle & aduyſe of hym / for he was experte
and ſubtyle in all feates of armes / both in ſautynge / 
ſealynge / and ſtealynge of fortreſſes.
The ſeconde reaſon was / the erle feared that if
this Aymergot ſhulde a byde behynde in the
countrey / thoughe he hadde ſolde to hym the
fortreſſe of Aloyſe and other fortreſſes / yet he
might do moche domage in the coūtrey of Auuergne
and Rouergne / wherfore therle made
great labour to haue hym. But alwayes Aymergot
diſſymuled the mater and ſaid. Whan
I ſe the certayne of the erle of Armynakes departyng / 
than I knowe myne owne wyll is ſo
good yt I wyll nat byde behynde. Other aunſwere
the erle coulde nat get of hym. The erle
of Armynake laye at Commynge and aboute
Tholouſyn / in his countrey / and there made
his aſſemble / whiche voyage had been more
haſted / and the voyage in to Auffryke hadde
nat been / that letted hym a ſeaſon / for dyuers
knyghtes and ſquyers that went in that voyage
had promyſed hym / and this voyage in
to Barbary came ſo ſodenly that it hyndred

his voyage. Whan tydynges was knowen in
Fraunce of the treaties that the erle of Armynake
had made with the ſayde capytayns in
Auuergne / there was made as moche haſte as
myght be to pay the money to the capytayns.
            Aymergot Marſell was ſore dyſpleaſed
with hym ſelfe in that he had ſolde
and deliuered the ſtronge caſtell of Aloyſe / for
he ſawe his owne auctorite therby greatly abated / 
and parceyued well howe he was the
leſſe feared / for all the ſeaſon that he kept it he
was doubted and feared / and honoured with
all men of warre of his parte / and had kept a
great aſtate alwayes in the caſtell of Aloyſe.
The pateſynge of countreys that he helde vnder
ſubiection / was well worth yerely twenty
thouſande florayns. Whan he remembred all
this he was ſoroufull / his treſour he thought
he wolde nat mynyſſhe / he was wonte dayly
to ſerche for newe pyllages / wherby encreſed
his profyte / and than he ſawe that all was cloſed
fro hym. Than he ſayde and imagyned / 
that to pyll and to robbe (all thynge conſydered)
was a good lyfe / and ſo repented hym of
his good doing. On a tyme he ſaid to his olde
companyons. Sirs / there is no ſporte nor glory
in this worlde amonge men of warre / but
to vſe ſuche lyfe as we haue done in tyme paſt.
What a ioy was it to vs whan we rode forthe
at aduenture / and ſomtyme foūde by the way
a ryche priour or marchaunt / or a route of mulettes
of Mountpellyer / of Narbone / of Lymons / 
of Fongans / of Beſyers / of Tholous / 
or of Carcaſſone / laden with clothe of Bruſelles / 
or peltre ware comynge fro the fayres / or
laden with ſpycery fro Bruges / fro Damas / 
or fro Alyſaūder / what ſo euer we met all was
ours / or els raunſomed at our pleaſures / dayly
we gate newe money / and the vyllaynes of
Auuergne and of Lymoſyn dayly prouyded
and brought to our caſtell whete mele / breed
redy baken / otes for our horſes / & lytter / good
wynes / beffes / and fatte mottons / pullayne / 
and wyldefoule / we were euer furnyſſhed as
though we had ben kingꝭ. whan we rode forth
all ye coūtrey trymbled for feare / all was ours
goynge or comynge? Howe toke we Carlaſte / 
I and the Bourge of Compayne / and I and
Perot of Bernoys tooke Caluſet? Howe dyd
we ſcale with lytell ayde the ſtronge caſtell of
Marquell / pertayninge to the erle Dolphyn / 
I kepte it nat paſt fyue dayes but I receyued
for it on a fayre table fyue thouſande frankes / 
and forgaue one thouſande for the loue of the
erle Dolphyns chyldren? By my faythe this
was a fayre and a good lyfe / wherfore I repute
my ſelf ſore diſceyued in that I haue rendred
vp the fortres of Aloys / for it wolde haue
ben kepte fro all the worlde / and the / daye that
I gaue it vp / it was fournyſſhed with vytayles
to haue been kepte ſeuen yere without any
reuytaylynge. This erle of Armynake hathe
dyſceyued me / Olyue Barbe & Perotle Bernoys
ſhewed me howe I ſhulde repente my
ſelfe. certayne I ſore repent me of that I haue
done. And whan ſuche of his companyons as
had ſerued hym longe herde hym ſpeke thoſe
wordes / they parceyued well howe he ſpake
them with all his herte vnfayned. Than they
ſayd to hym. Aymergot we are all redy yet to
ſerue you / lette vs renewe agayne our warre / 
and lette vs gette ſome ſtronge holde in Auuergne
or in Lymoſyn / and let vs fortifye it / 
and than ſyr we ſhall ſoone recouer our domages.
we ſhall make a goodly flyght in Auuergne
and in Lymoſyn / for as nowe the erle
Dolphyn and Hugh his brother are out of the
countrey / & dyuers other knightes and ſquyers
in their company in to the voyage of Barbary / 
and ſpecyally the lorde of Coucy / who
hath the ſouerayne regarde vnder the kynge
of all thoſe marches / therfore we ſhall nat nede
to feare hym / nor the duke of Berrey / for he is
at Parys / ſo thus we ſhall haue nowe a good
ſeaſon. Well quod Aymergot / I haue good
wyll thus to do / ſauynge I ame by name expreſſed
in the chartre of the treuce. What for
that ſyr quod his company / ye nede nat care
therfore if ye lyſte. ye are nat ſubiecte to the
frenche kynge / ye owe hym nother faythe nor
obeyſayunce / ye are the kynge of Englandes
manne / for your herytage (whiche is all dyſtroyd
and loſt) lyeth in Lymoſyn / and ſyr we
muſt lyue. and though we make warre to lyue
the englyſſhmen wyll nat be myſcontent with
vs / and ſuche as be in our caſe wyll drawe to
vs. And ſyr we haue nowe good tytle to make
warre / for we be nat now in Auuergne where
the couenaunte was made that we be bounde
vnto. lette vs ſende to the vyllayns of the vyllages
whanne we be ones in a ſtronge holde / 
and commaunde them to paye vs a truage / or
els to make theym ſore warre. Well ſyrs quod

Aymergot / fyrſt lette vs prouyde for a ſtronge
place to abyde in and to drawe vnto whan we
nede. Some of theym ſayde / ſyr we knowe
where there is a ſtronge holde / with a lytell
newe fortifyenge / pertaynynge to the herytage
of the lorde of the Towre / no man kepeth
it / lette vs drawe thyder and fortifye it / than
may we at our eaſe rynne in to Auuergne and
Lymoſyn. Where lyeth this place quod Aymergot?
Syr quod they within a leage of the
Towre / and it is called the Roche of Vandoys.
It is trewe quod Aymergot / I knowe
it well / it is a mete place for vs / lette vs go thyder
and fortify it. Thus on this purpoſe they
concluded / and on a day aſſembled togyther
and wente to the Roche of Vandoys. Than
Aymergote auewed the place to ſe if it were
worthe the fortifyenge therof. And whan he
had well auewed the ſytuacion therof / and the
defences that myght be made there / it pleaſed
hym ryght well. Thus they toke it and fortifyed
it lytell and lytell or they began to do any
dyſpleaſure in the countrey. And whan they
ſawe the place ſtronge ſufficyently to reſyſt a
gaynſte ſyege or aſſaute / and that they were
well horſed and well prouyded of all thynges
neceſſary for their defence / than they beganne
to ryde abrode in the countrey and tooke priſoners
and raunſomed them / and prouyded
their holde with fleſſhe / meale / waxe / wyne / 
ſalte / yron / and ſtele / and of all other neceſſaryes.
There came nothynge amyſſe to theym
without it hadde ben to heuy or to hote. The
countrey all aboute and the people / wenynge
to haue ben in reſte and peace by reaſon of the
truce made bytwene the two kinges and their
realmes / they began than to be ſore abaſſhed / 
for theſe robbers & pyllers toke them in their
houſes / and where ſo euer they founde them / 
in the feldes laborynge. and they called them
ſelfes aduenturers. Whanne the lorde of the
towre knewe that he had ſuche neyghbours
ſo nere hym / he was nat well aſſured of hym
ſelfe but fortifyed and made good watche in
all his townes and caſtelles. The counteſſe of
Dolphyn a ryght valyaunt lady and of great
prudence / beinge with her chyldren in a good
towne and ſtronge caſtell of hers called Sardes / 
ſhe was nat well aſſured of her ſelfe whan
ſhe herde that Aymergotte and his company
had fortifyed yt Roche of Vandoys. She ſent
incontynente to all her caſtell and furnyſſhed
them with men of warre / as Marquell / Oudable / 
Chyllac / and Blere / and in to other places / 
to the entente they ſhulde nat be ſurpryſed / 
for ſhe greatly douted this Aymergot bycauſe
he hadde of her before at one paymente
fyue thouſande florayns. Surely all the countrey
of Auuergne and Lymoſyn began greatlye
to be a frayde. Thanne the knyghtes and
ſquyers / and men of the good townes / as of
Cleremount / of Mounte Ferante / and of Ryon / 
determyned to ſende to the frenche kinge / 
and ſo they dyd.
            IN the meane ſeaſon whyle the ſayde
counteſſe and the other good men of
the countrey dyd ſende to the frenche
kinge and to the duke of Berrey / who as than
were at Parys / Aymergot and his company
fortifyed greatly the Roche of Vandoys. firſt
they made a lodgynge for their horſes. Whan
all other aduētures who were diſcharged out
of wages herde howe Aymergot made warre
agayne / they were ryght ioyfull therof / and
many came to hym. Anone he had mo of theſe
robbers and pyllers than he wolde haue / they
demaunded no wages of hym / but all onely
that they myght be of his bande / for all ſuche
as myght be of his company they knewe well
they ſhulde lyghtly wynne ſomewhat / for they
were habandoned to robbe and to pyll. Thus
they rode vp and downe and made them ſelfe
to be knowen in dyuers places. There was
no ſpekynge in Auuergne and Lymoſyn but
of them of Roche Vandoys / the coūtrey was
ſore afrayde. They of Caluſet (wherof Perotte
le Bernoys was capytayne) helde and
kepte fermely the treuce that was made / and
whan he ſawe that Aymergot Marcell ouer
ranne ſo the countrey / he was ſore dyſpleaſed
with hym / and ſayde howe he dyd yuell / and
ſent hym worde that he nor none of his ſhulde
come in to Caluſet / nor in to none other place
where he had any rewle. Aymergot cared nothynge
for that / for he hadde places ynowe to
drawe vnto. beſyde that he had menne ynowe / 
and dayly encreaſed / for ſuche as were mynded
to do yuell drewe to hym dayly. Perot of
Bernoys charged ſuche as were vnder his
reule on payne of their lyues that none ſhulde
ryde out to do any domage to his neighbours
for he ſayde he wolde ſurely kepe the trewce.

Olyue Barbe captayne of Ouſac dyſſymuled
the mater / ſayeng howe he wolde kepe the
treuce / howe be it as it was ſhewed me ſome
of his men ſomtyme wolde ryde forthe ſecretlye / 
and what they wanne he wolde haue the
profyte therof. The men of the countreys of
Cleremount / of Mount Ferant / and of Ryon
who were goynge in meſſage to the frenche
kynge / and to the duke of Berrey. They ſped
ſo in their iourneys that they came to Parys / 
and there founde the kynge / the duke of Berrey / 
the duke of Thourayne / and the conſtable
of Fraunce ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon. They
came fyrſte to the duke of Berrey and to his
counſayle / and ſhewed the cauſe of their commyng / 
howe Aymergot Marcell made warre
and dyſtroyed the countrey of Auuergne / and
howe the yuell people daily multyplyed / wherfore
they deſyred for goddeſſake to haue ſome
remedy. ſayenge if theſe yuell people ſhulde
longe contyne we / they wolde diſtroy the countrey
of Auuergne / and the fronters of Lymoſyn.
Whan theſe tydynges came to the kynge
and to the duke of Berrey / they were ſore dyſpleaſed / 
for they had thought all had been in
peace / by reaſon of the treuce. Than the kyng
demaunded if they of the garyſon of Caluſet
and Ouſac dyd any yuell or nat. They aunſwered
and ſayd / they complayned of no man
but al onely of Aymergot Marcell and of his
company / who hathe fortifyed the Roche of
Vandoys. Thanne the kynge and the duke of
Berrey aunſwered and ſayd. Syrs ye good
people take good herde to your ſelfes and we
ſhall prouyde ſhortely a remedy / that ye ſhall
well perceyue▪ retourne to your places and
ſhewe this aunſwere to theym that ſente you
hyther. Theſe good men of Auuergne were
well content with their aunſwere / and taryed
there two dayes / and thanne retourned and
toke their leaue ſpecyally of the duke of Berrey
and ſo departed.
            THe frenche kynge and his counſayle
forgate nat theſe tydynges / nor the
duke of Berrey / whome the matter
touched greatly / bycauſe he helde great herytages
in Auuergne / therfore he auaunced the
buſyneſſe. ye haue herde here before howe the
lorde of Coucy was ordayned by the kynge
and his coūſayle to be capitayne / and to haue
the ſoueraygne rewle of all the countrey / fro
the ſee by Rochell / vnto the ryuer of Dordone
and to Burdeaux on the ryuer of Geron. As
than the lorde of Coucy was nat in the countrey:
He was goynge in the voyage to Barbary / 
with other lordes of Fraunce / and of
other countreis. Howe be it at his departynge
he ordayned his coſyn ſir Robert of Bethune
Vycount of Meaulx to be his lyeutenaunt
in the ſayde countrey. Than the kyng
ſayde / howe it was mooſt meteſt that the vycount
of Meaulx ſhulde haue the charge of
that voyage to go in to Lāguedocke / rather
than̄e any other perſone. He was at Coude
on the ryuer of Marne. The kynge wrote to
hym. The meſſangere founde hym with his
wyfe at Counde / and there he delyuered his
letters fro the Frenche kynge. The vycount
receyued theym / and whane he knewe what
they mente / he ſayde he wolde obey the kynges
commaūdement. He prepared hym ſelfe
as ſoone as he myght / & departed fro Coūde
and rode ſo long that he cae to Parys where
he founde the kynge and his counſayle / who
ſayd vnto hym. Vycount make you redy / aſſemble
the men of warre of your retynue / for
ye muſt go in to Auuergne. There be of thes
pyllers and robbers / of whome Aymergotte
Mercell is chiefe / as we be enfourmed / who
diſtroyech and ſore traueyleth the good people
there. Do ye ſo moche as to driue theym
out of that countrey: And if ye maye attrap
the ſayde Aymergotte bring hym to vs / and
we ſhall haue great ioye therof. It is ordayned
that there ſhalbe delyuered to you / ſuche
ſommes of money at Cleremount / that ſhall
ſuffyce for your men of warre. And to go fro
hens thider ſpeke to oure treaſourers / & they
ſhall delyuer you for your expenſes. Make
haſte / for it requyreth dyligence. The Vycount
aunſwered howe he was redy / and ſo
went to his lodging. And there he wrote letters
to knyghtes and ſquyers in Fraūce and
Picardy of his acquayntaunce & retynewe / 
that they in all haſt ſhulde mete with hym at
Charters / and there to make their muſters.
ſuch as he wrote vnto obeyed / they loued the
Vycount / for they helde hym for a good capitayne.
So they came to the cytie of Charters
at their day prefyxed. There aſſembled
a two hūdred ſpeares of good men of warre.
Whan̄e they were aſſembled / they departed

fro Charters and tooke the waye towardes
Auuergne / and ſo came in to Burbonoys. tidynges
came in to Auuergne howe ſocours
was cōmyng to them out of Fraunce / wherof
all the countrey was reioyſed.
            
               IT was nedefull that theſe men
of warre came thyder ſo ſoone
as they dyde / for and they hadde
taryed but ſixe dayes lengar / aymergot
Marcell and his bande
had thought to haue ouer ronne the playne
countrey / bytwene Cleremount and Moūtferante / 
and about Ryon to Ganape. And if
they had made that voyage they hadde done
great dommage to the countrey / more to the
valewe than a hundred thouſande frankes / 
for in thoſe marcheſſe laye the rycheſſe of Auuergne / 
and no man ſhulde haue reſyſted thē
for the countrey as than̄e was voyde of any
man of warre. And alſo the brute was / that
Aymergotte Mercelles company was farre
mo in nombre than̄e they were in dede. Aymergotte
was redy to haue made this iourney / 
but tidynges came to hym howe ſoeuer
it was by pylgrimes or by eſpyes that the vycoūt
of Meaulx with a great company was
comynge agaynſt hym to make hym warre / 
and to putte hym out of his fortreſſe of the
Roche of Vandoys. Theſe newes letted his
enterprice / and kepte hym ſelfe within his
holde / and thought they ſhulde be beſieged.
Than Aymergot Marcell began to dought
and repented hym of that he hadde done / for
he knewe well if that he were takenne / there
ſhulde no raunſome go for hym. Thanne he
ſayd to ſome of his company. I am ſhamed:
I haue beleued yuell counſayle: Couytouſneſſe
ſhall diſtroye me / without I haue conforte.
Than̄e they ſayde to hym. Sir / why
dought ye thus? We haue ſene you the hardyeſt
man of armes of all theſe marcheſſe.
We haue a good garyſon and well prouyded
and we are men of defence / and loue as well
to defende oure bodyes / as ye do to defende
yours / ye can leſe nothynge but we muſt leſe
alſo. If by aduenture ye be taken / ye ſhall
make your fynaunce accordynge to reaſon.
ye haue good ynoughe and we haue nothynge.
If we be taken it lyeth on our heedes / we
gette none other remiſſion. We ſhall ſell ou
                  •
               
lyues dere. Lette vs defende our ſelfe aſwell
as we can / be nat abaſſhed with any thynge
that we here or ſe. We thynke we ſhall natte
nede to care for any ſiege. Lette vs warre wiſely.
Thus theſe companyons conforted Aymergot
Marcell.
            
               THe Vycounte of Meaulx with
his company came forward tyll
they came to Moleyns in Burbonoys.
There the ducheſſe of
Burbone / doughter to the Erle
Dolphyn receyued the Vycount and his knightes
ryght honorably / and made theym to
dyne. Than they paſſed forthe and laye that
nyght at ſaynt Purſant / and fro thens to Ganape
and ſo to Argre Proſe / and than to Ryon / 
and fro thens to Cleremount where they
were well receyued with the byſſhoppe and
with theym of the towne. There the men of
warre had money / for there was a tayle gadered
and delyuered at Cleremont. Thanne

WHan̄e Aymergot Marcell and
Guyotdu Sall his vncle / vnderſtode
that theſe men of war
of Fraunce / of Picardy / of Auuergne / 
& of Gene were come to
our Lady of Dornall / and were mynded to
come & laye ſiege to their holde of Roche vā
               doys.
Than they aduyſed what was beſt for
them to do to make defence. Firſte they conſydred
well / that it was 
                  •
               at for them to kepe
any horſe / ſeyng they ſhulde be beſieged. nat
farre of fro the Roche of Vandois there was
another ſtronge holde called ſaynt Souperye / 
vnder the rule of Aymergotte Mercell / 
and there was his wyfe / and thyder he ſente
all his pages and horſes and the mooſt parte
of all his rycheſſe. This roche of Vandoys
was well fortifyed / and it ſtode in a ſtronge
grounde. The lorde of the Towre was ſore
blamed of them of the countrey / that he had
lefte that place vnfortifyed and vnprouyded
It was cōmonly ſayde in Auuergne / yt they
myght thanke the lorde of the Towre for all
the dōmage they had taken / bicauſe he might
well haue kepte the Roche of Vandoys / or if
he wolde nat haue kepte it for coſt / he myght
haue delyuered it to the men of the countre / yt
they myght haue raſed it / in ſuche wyſe / that
it ſhulde nat haue ben tenable / but he left the
walles hole and entyer / as he founde them.
This Roche of Vandoys is ſette amonge
highe mountayns / and that rocke ſtandeth a
parte / and on the one ſyde the walles be of a
rocke. They had ſo fortifyed it / that it coude
nat be aſſayled but on the fore parte by ſcrymyſſhynge.
The Vycount of Meaulx deꝑted
fro our lady of Dorcynall / and knightes
and ſquyers / and genouoys croſ bowes / and
ſo came before the Roche of Vandoys. there
lyke good men of warre they layde their ſiege / 
and lytell and lytell amended their lodgynges.
Whan̄e the counteſſe of Alfyne beinge
at Sardes / knewe the trewe tidynges
that the Roche of Vādoys was beſieged ſhe
was right ioyfull. And bycauſe that ſhe thought
that the Vicount of Meaulx was come
ſo farre (as out of Fraūce and Picardy) that
he had brought with hym no tentes nor pauilyons.
She ordayned for hym two fayre and
good tentes / parteyning to therle Dolphyn / 
and ſente them to the Vycount / by maner of
lendynge of them to hym durynge the ſiege.
The vycount toke the preſent in good gree / 
and recōmaunded hym hertely to the counteſſe / 
thākyng her for the tentes that ſhe had
ſente hym / for they ſhulde do hym good ſeruyce.
The lorde of the Towre was in his
owne countrey / and was within a myle of a
caſtell of his owne / ſo yt he lacked nothyng:
other knyghtes and ſquiers made prouiſion
as well as they myght. They had vitaylles
plentie fro all partes at a reſonable price. the
ſeaſon was fayre / drie / and hote / as in ye moneth
of Auguſt. The knyghtes and other cō
               panyons
refreſſhed theym ſelfes vnder the
grene bowes. Than tidynges came in to the
hooſt that dyde put the lordes and their companyons
in dout. It was ſhewed them that
the gariſons of their ennemyes / as of Caluſet
and of Douſacke aſſembled toguyder / &
were determyned in a morenynge to awake
the hooſt or they were ware / and to reyſe the
ſiege. Than the vycount of Meaulx and his
knyghtes toke counſayle togyder and determyned
to ſende a heraude to Perot of Bernoys
capitayne of Caluſette and to Olyue
Barbe capitayne of Douſac to knowe their
myndes / to the entent that they were nat ſurpriſed / 
but that they myght be aſſured of the
Englyſſhe garyſōs. And accordyng as they
had aunſwere agayne / therafter to prouyde
for them ſelfe. They ſente an heraude and enſtructed
hym what he ſhulde do and ſaye. the
heraulde departed fro the hooſt and rode to
Caluſet / and thereby aduenture founde Perotte
at the barryers with many of his company / 
who were there ſportyng and caſtyng
the ſtone. Than the meſſanger lyghted from
his horſe and demaunded for the capitayne.
He was brought to hym / and whan he came
before hym he dyde his meſſage fro poynt to
poynt. Than Perot le Bernoys ſayde. Heraude / 
ſaye to youre mayſters that we wyll
holde and kepe as affermely and trewly / the
truece that is taken bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / in lyke maner / as we wolde they
ſhulde kepe with vs. And if we knowe any
of ours that wyll breke or vyolate the peace
by any maner of incydent. If we maye take
them / we ſhall do ſuche correctyon as aparteyneth
to be doone / as we haue promyſed.
And we wyll that ye ſaye to youre mayſters / 
that loke what Aymergotte hath done / was

without our counſayle / for he neuer ſhewed
vs of his purpoſe. We dyde charge hym and
all his / that he ſhulde nat medyll in our ſeignorie / 
if he dyde / he ſhulde haue an yuell
ende. The heraulde was hadde in to the fortreſſe
and there dyned. Than he tooke leaue
and there was gyuen hym ten frankes. than
he departed and demaūded the way to Douſacke / 
and founde there Olyue Barbe / capitayne
of that fortreſſe. The heraulde ſpake
to hym in lyke maner / as he hadde doone to
Perot le Bernoys. Olyue Barbe anſwered
that in no wyſe he wolde breke the treuſe / bycauſe
he wolde nat be diſhonored / and there
he gaue hym ten frankes / and than departed
and retourned to his mayſter / before ye roche
of Vandoys. Than the knyghtes were ſore
deſyrous to here tidynges / they drewe about
the vycoūt. There the heraude ſhewed how
he had ben at Calyſet and at Douſacke / and
what anſwere he had of the capitayns. than
the Vicount prayſed moche Perotte le Bernoyes
and Olyue Barbe / and was as than
out of doute / and ſo contynued their ſiege.
            THe ſiege beyng before the Roche of
Vandoys / euery day there was ſcrimyſſhing
& often tymes ſome hurte
with ſhotte of the genouoys croſ bowes / for
the genouoys were good ſhoters. Thus the
ſiege cōtynued a nyne wekes. Thenterprice
of the garyſon was greatlye to the aduauntage
of them within / I ſhall ſhewe you the
maner howe. At certayne places they might
iſſue out at their pleaſure / in diſpyght of all
their ennemyes / for & they ſhulde haue kepte
them fro their iſſues / they had nede to haue
had mo than ſixe .M. men. Thus durynge
the ſiege Aymergot was ryght ymaginatife
and conſydred all thynges / and ſawe well
howe he had nat done well / but to tourne his
dede in good maner / and to thentent that the
Roche of Vandoys ſhulde ſtyll remayne wt
hym. He ſent in to Englande a varlet of his
with letters of credence / to the kynge of Englande
and to the duke of Lancaſtre. And of
this purpoſe he brake his mynde to an vncle
of his called Guyot du Sall / a man of a thre
ſcore yere of age / who had greatlye vſed dedes
of armes / and knewe moche of ye worlde
Whan Aymergote had ſhewed hym the maner
howe he wolde ſende in to Englāde / this
Guyotte was well agreed therto / and ſayde
howe to ſende a wyſe man thyder coulde do
no hurte. Than they ſente a varlet / who had
ben brought vp among them. Aymergot enſtructed
hym and ſayde. We ſhall ſette the
out of this houſe in ſaue garde out of all peryll / 
and thou ſhalte haue golde and ſyluer
ynoughe. Thou ſhalte go in to Englande
with theſe letters / one to the kynge / another
to the duke of Lācaſtre / and the thirde to the
kynges counſayle / and all theſe letters are of
credence. Than they wyll demaunde of the
the occaſyon of thy cōmynge thyder. And after
thou haſt made thy recōmendacion / thou
ſhalte ſaye yt Aymergot Mercell their poore
ſoudyour and ſubiecte / and redy with good
wyll to do them ſeruyce / is encloſed and beſeged
in a lytell fortreſſe parteyning to the feaultie
of Lymoſyn / belongyng to the kynge
of Englandes herytage. And they that lye
at the ſiege / traueyleth & taketh great payne
daylye to wyn vs that dothe defende the fortreſſe.
And the capitayne of them without is
a lorde / coſyn to the lorde of Coucy called ſir
Robert vycount of Meaulx / ſet there by the
Frenche kyng. Therfore deſyre the kynge &
his counſayle / and ſpecially the duke of Lancaſtre
who hath the ſouerayne gouernaunce
in Burdeloys / and of the kyng of Englādes
heritage in theſe ꝑties. That it wolde pleaſe
them to write and to cōmaunde the vycount
of Meaulx to deꝑte fro the ſiege and to reyſe
his army. And to write to the Vycount that
he is about to breke the peace that was taken
at Balyngham / bytwene Boloygne and Calays.
And bycauſe I am in doute what aunſwere
the vicount wyll make to theſe letters
(for he is ſomwhat ſtronge and fro warde)
Therfore deſyre that I maye haue in lykewyſe
letters fro the kyng and his counſayle / 
and fro the duke of Lancaſtre to the duke of
Berrey. For if the duke of Berrey wyll / incontynent
the ſiege ſhall be rayſed. And for
the more ſuretie / deſyre to haue with ye ſome
knight of honoure of the kynges houſe or of
the duke of Lancaſters / ſuche one as the duke
of Berrey knoweth / and the other lordes
of Fraunce. And ſhewe hym fro me that I
ſhall gyue hym a .C. frankes. Remembre all
theſe wordes and do thy meſſage acordingly
and ſhewe thē that thou ſpekeſt withall that
this lytell fortreſſe that I haue fortified / if it

maye abyde ſtyll Englyſſhe. It ſhall come
well to poynte / and ſpecially to thē that wyll
make warre in theſe parties for the kynge of
Englande / for the fortreſſe ſtādeth on the frō
               ters
of the countrey / for therby maye be won
at a ſeaſon in Auuergne and Lymoſyn / two
thouſande frankes.
            WHan Aymergot Marcell & Guyotdu
Sall his vncle had well enſtructed
this varlet / and that the letters
of credence were written and ſealed / and delyuerd.
The varlet departed by nyght and
was well accompanyed and conueyed a fote
to another fortreſſe ꝑteynynge to Aymergot
called ſaint Soupery. There he toke a horſe
ſuche as he wolde choſe / for he hadde a great
iourney to ryde. He rode forthe through the
realme of Fraūce lyke a Frenche man of Auuergne / 
and ſo came to Calais and acquaynted
hym ſelfe with the Capitayne ſir Iohan
Beauchampe / and ſhewed hym parte of his
buſyneſſe / to the entent to haue the ſoner paſſage / 
as he had. So he came to Douer and
than toke his iourney to Lōdon. And it was
his fortune that the kynge of Englande and
his two vncles / and the duke of Lancaſtre
and the kynges coūſayle were the ſame tyme
at the palais of Weſtmynſter in counſayling
for maters of Northumberlande / for the ſcottes
helde nat well the trueſe / as complayntes
were made. The ſame tyme Aymergottes
varlet came to Lōdon and there toke his lodgynge / 
and ſhewed his hoſt parte of ye cauſe
of his commynge. His hoſt brought hym to
Weſtmynſter / and cauſed hym firſte to ſpeke
with the duke of Lancaſtre who was in his
chambre. it was or he went to the counſayle.
there ye varlet delyuered hym his letters. the
duke toke & reed them. Than he drewe hym
a parte / & demaunded what credence he had.
Than the varlet ſhewed hym all the hole mater / 
as ye haue herde here before. The duke
herde hym well / and demaunded if he had any
mo letters / and he ſayd that he had letters
to the kyng and to his counſayle / that is well
quod the duke / I ſhall cauſe the to haue audyence.
than the duke went to the counſayle.
And whan he ſawe the hour and tyme he moued
the varlettes mater / and by the dukes aduauncement
the varlet was ſente for. Than
he delyuered to the kyng and to his coūſayle
the letters / they were opyned and reed: and
than he was demaunded what was his credēce / 
and the varlet who was hardy and nat
abaſſhed / ſhewed the buſineſſe of Aymergot
Marcell right ſagely / and the better aſſured
bycauſe euery man gaue hym good audiēce.
Whan he had ſaid as moche as he wolde / thā
he was anſwered / that the kyng wolde take
coūſayle in the mater and make an anſwere.
Than he went out of the counſayle chambre
and taryed tyll he had an anſwere.
            THe aunſwere was / that the kynge
wolde write to the vycount of Meaulx
and alſo to the duke of Berrey
accordyng as Aymergot had requyred / and
in lykewiſe ſo promyſed the duke of Lancaſtre.
and whan the letters were writen / there
was a gentylman of the duke of Lancaſtres
apoynted to bere theſe letters. So they paſſed
the ſee / and with them went Derby an heralde
the better to forther the mater / bycauſe
he was aquaynted with the lordes of Auuergne / 
and ſpecially with the duke of Berrey.
The gentylman of the duke of Lancaſters
named Herbery / went with the better wyll / 
bycauſe the varlette promyſed hym in the behalfe
of Aymergot a hundred frākes. Thus
they thre departed and came to Douer / and
fro thens at a tyde to Calis. And whan their
horſes were vnſhypped / they toke the waye
to Boloygne and ſo throughe Picardy / and
went to Parys / & fro thens in to Auuergne.
And whan they approched nere to Lymogines / 
and to the coūtre where the roche of Vā
               doyes
was ſette. They rode about the more
ſecretely to come thyder.
            
               THus as I haue ſhewed you thes
meſſangers dyde ſo moche that
they came nere to the roche of vā
               doyes.
Whanne they were nere
where the ſiege laye / the ſquyer
and the heraulde thought it for the beſt / nat
to entre in to the towne at that preſent tyme.
But they ſent the varlet in to the towne / ſayeng
they wolde do well ynough without his
company. For they ſayd if he ſhulde be ſene
with them / they at the ſiege wolde ſuppoſe / 
that he had ben ſente in to Englande for thē.
the varlet obeyed / & in the night he entred in
to ye towne without daūger. than Aymergot

Marcell & Guyot du Sall made hym good
chere / and had marueyle that he had ſpedde
his iourney in ſo ſhort a ſpace. There be ſhewed
howe he had ſpedde / and howe a ſquier
of the duke of Lācaſters and a heraude was
come with him with letters fro the kyng and
fro the duke of Lancaſtre / bothe to the Vycount
of Meaulr and to the duke of Berrey
if nede were. And why quod Aymergot mercell / 
are they nat come hyder into this caſtell
Sir ꝙ the varlet / they ſayd they two wolde
do their meſſage well inough / nor they wold
haue no man ſene in their cōpany that ſhulde
come fro you. They are the wyſer ꝙ Guyot
du Sall / therby it ſhall ſeme that the mater
toucheth the kyng of Englāde and the duke
of Lancaſtre. Sir it is trewe quod the barlet.
Of thoſe tidynges Aymergot was ioyfull
and ſayde to the varlet. Thou haſt well
and dilygently ſpedde thy maters / and that
in a ſhorte ſeaſon / I ſhall well rewarde the
for thy labour. Thus the ſquyer and the heraude
came ſtreight to the ſiege and demaū
               ded
for the Vycoūtes lodgynge. They were
brought thyder and there they founde the vycount
beholding men caſtyng the ſtone. than
they kneled and ſaluted hym and he them agayne / 
and demaūded fro whens they came.
They anſwered and ſaid / howe they cāe out
of Englande / ſent thyder by their kyng and
by the duke of Lancaſter. ye are welcome ꝙ
the Vycount / what mater hath brought you
in to this wylde countrey. Sir quod the heraude
beholde here this ſquier of the duke of
Lācaſters / who hath brought to you letters
fro the kynge of Englande and fro the duke
of Lancaſtre / if it pleaſe you to rede thē. and
bycauſe I ſōwhat knewe the countrey I am
come in his company. Than the ſquyer delyuered
his letters / and the vycount receyued
them and behelde the ſeales / and knewe well
they came out of Englande. Than he tooke
one aparte that coude rede / and there he reed
the letters fro poynt to poynt two or thre tymes
tyll he knewe well what they ment. thā
he ſtudyed & regarded well the kyng of Englandes
writyng / who ſayd in his writynge
that he had marueyle that he wolde lodge / 
ſlepe / and reſte hym with an army of men of
warre on his herytage. & that he dothe daylye
all that he can to breke the peace / whiche
he ought in no wyſe to do / for it is greatly 
                  •
               iudiciall
to them that haue ſette to their ſeales
to the confyrmacion of the peace. and the
concluſyon of the letter was / howe the kyng
cōmaunded them incontynent after the ſight
of his letts that he and his company ſhulde
departe and reyſe their ſiege / and ſuffre Aymergot
Mercell peſably to enioye the houſe
parteyning to his heritage / whiche hath coſt
hym great goodes the fortifieng. Theſe wordes
and ſuche other were encloſed in theſe letters
all to the ayde of Aymergot Marcell. in
lyke maner as the kynges letters ſpake / the
duke of Lancaſter ſange the ſame note / commaundyng
lyke the excellent duke of Acquitayne
and of all that duchy. And whan the vicount
of Meaulx had well aduyſed hym ſelfe
he ſayde. Fayre ſirs / theſe tidynges that ye
haue brought requyreth counſayle and aduyſe / 
I ſhall take coūſayle and than ye ſhall
be anſwered. Than they were made to drīke
of the vycountes wyne. In the meane tyme
the vycount toke counſayle / for he ſent for the
lorde of the Towre & for ſir Guyllyam Butler / 
ſir Robert Dolphyn / ſir Loyes Dābyer / 
and alſo for the lorde Montaguy / and for ſir
Berat de la Ryuer / who was of his houſe.
And whan they were all toguyder / he renewed
the wordes / and ſhewed them the cauſe
why he had ſent for them / and there cauſed ye
letters to be reed before them. Whan theſe lordes
herde that / they had great marueile how
theſe letters coude be brought out of Englā
               de / 
for as than they had nat layne at the ſiege
paſt a moneth. I ſhall ſhewe you quod the
vycount what I ſuppoſe. Aymergot Marcell
is a ſubtell man / as ſoone as he ſawe that
he ſhulde be beſieged / I thynke he ſent incō
               tynent
ſome meſſanger in to Englande to attayne
theſe letters / the whiche I maye obey
if I lyſte / but I ſhall anſwere them ſhortely
But as in that the kyng of England and the
duke of Lancaſtre cōmaundeth me to do / I
wyll nothynge obey their cōmaundementes / 
for I am nat bounde to obey thē / but all onelye
the Frenche kynge / by whoſe cōmaundement
I am ſent hyder. Call forthe the ſquier
and the heraude I ſhall make them their anſwere / 
they were brought forthe. Than the
vycount began to ſpeke as foloweth.
            you Derby and Tomelyn Herbery / thus
ye be named accordyng to the tenour of your

letters / and as it apereth ye be ſent hyther frothe
kynge of Englande / & fro the duke of Lancaſtre / 
they are enfourmed I can nat tell howe
outher by Aymergot Marcell or by ſome other
that wolde ayde him / and hath ben in England
in his name / howe I am at this preſent
tyme with an army of men of warre lodged on
the herytage of the kynge of Englandes / and
he commaundeth me to departe and reyſe my
ſiege / and to ſuffre Aymergot Marcell peaſably
to enioy this lytell fortreſſe / whiche hathe
coſte ſo moche the fortefyenge / and alſo they
ſende me worde howe I do put my ſelfe in parell
of dyſhonorynge / in that I ſhulde conſent
to breke the peace / ſealed and conf
                  •
               rmed to endure
thre yeres bytwene the two kynges and
their alyes. Fayre ſirs I ſay vnto you that I
wyll do nothyng that ſhall be againſt the charter
of peace / I wyll kepe the treuce / and do nothynge
agaynſt it / and though I am lodged
here it breketh no peace nor treuce. I am ſubget
to the frenche kynge who hath ſent me hyther / 
and hath admytted me as his marſhall
of this ſmall armye / for it came to the knowledge
of the kynge my mayſter and his counſayle / 
by greuous complayntes of the noble
men & other of the countrey of Auuergne and
Lymoſyn / howe they had taken great domages
and loſſes / by the meanes that Aymergot
aduyſed a ſtrong place bytwene the coūtr
                  ••
               s / 
which was voyde and nat inhabyted / he toke
and fortefyed it / and hath nat made it a houſe
of peace or ſolace / but a ſtronge fortreſſe and a
reſortynge place for theues / robbers / and murderers / 
whervpon I am cōmaūded to be here
to defende the countrey / and to the entent that
ſuche as be aſſembled in this fortteſſe ſhulde
nat multyply in their wickedneſſe / but to punyſſhe
them by ſuche ſentence as apartayneth
to their treſpace / and for that entente I do put
to my payne to take them if I can / the whiche
cōmaundemente of my mayſter I wyll obey / 
and ſhall do my deuoyre to acquyte me truly.
and fro hence I wyll nat departe what ſo euer
cōmaundemente I haue / tyll I haue the fortreſſe / 
and them that be within. And if Aymergot
Marcell wyll ſay that I am auaunced to
breke the peace / lette hym come forthe and he
ſhall be fought withall with one that is better
than he / and ſhal cauſe to be proued by dyuers
poyntes and artycles / that he hym ſelfe breaketh
the peace. Sirs all thynges conſydred I
make you this aunſwere / ye maye retourne
whan it pleace you / and whan ye come there
as ye wold be / ſay none otherwyſe nor no leſſe
than I haue ſayde to you / for often tymes reportes
nat truely ſet / enfourmeth lordes often
tymes otherwyſe than the trouthe is in dede.
Syr quod the ſquyer we are come hyther for
none other purpoſe but to reporte the trouth
of that we here and ſe / and ſythe ye wyll none
otherwyſe do / we nede no lenger to abyde here
and ſo toke their leaue. And there was gyuen
to the haraulde ten frankes / for the honour of
the kynge of Englande and the duke of Lancaſtre.
            WHan they were departed they toke the
hyghe way to Cleremount / and ſayd
they wolde agayne to Parys / & whan
they were halfe a leage on their way than they
began to entre in to their mater and ſayd. As
yet we haue done nothynge / it behoueth vs to
go to the duke of Berrey in to Auuergne / who
is lorde of this countrey / for he writeth hym
ſelfe duke of Berrey and of Auuergne / the by
counte of Meaulx dare nat diſpleaſe the duke
if he cōmaunde hym to departe / and we haue
letters fro the kynge our mayſter and fro the
duke of Lancaſtre to hym / wherfore it is reaſon
that we delyuer them / and that we maye
knowe his entente. They concluded on that
purpoſe / and ſo rode to Cleremounte / thyde
                  •
               
they were welcome / for the haraulde knewe
the countrey / and whan they were demaūded
what they were / they anſwered that they were
meſſangers ſent fro the kynge of Englande / 
and than they demaunded where the duke of
Berrey was / and it was ſhewed them that the
duke and the duches was in a caſtell of theirs
named the Nonec
                  •
               e. The haraulde knewe it
well / he had been there before. Than they departed
fro Cleremount / and rode to Vyore / 
and fro thens to Nonect. There is a hyghe
mountayne to paſſe or one come to the caſtell.
Whan they came there ye duke of Berrey with
many other was ſportynge without the gate / 
the harauld was knowen with dyuers. Than
they were brought to ye duke / who for the loue
of the kynge of Englande and of the duke of
Lancaſtre / made them good chere. the ſquyer
delyuered his letters to the duke / who receyued
them / and opened and red them at length
two tymes ouer. Than he ſtudyed a lytell and

anſwered them curteſly and ſayde. Syrs for
the loue of our coſyns in Englande we ſhall
gladly do our power. Of the which aunſwere
the ſquyer and the haraulde were ryght ioyouſe
and thought than howe they had ſped all
their mater / but it was nat ſo as ye ſhall here
after. howe be it the duke of Berrey at the begynnynge
dyd his deuoyre to haue rayſed the
ſiege to pleaſe therby the kynge of Englande
and the duke of Lancaſtre / who deſyred that
the ſiege myght be reyſed before the Roche of
Vandoys / and that the lytell fortreſſe myght
abyde ſtyll to Aymergot Marcell & if he haue
done any thyng to dyſpleaſe the frenche kyng
or his coūſayle the kynge of Englande wolde
ſe that there ſhulde be amendes made. And the
duke of Berrey bycauſe he wold acquyte him
truely to the englyſſhe mennes deſyres / ſuche
as were in his houſe / he wrote incontynente
letters well endyghted to the vycount of Meaul
                  •
                /
and theſe letters were red or they were
ſealed before the englyſſhe men / who thought
them well ordayned. Theſe letters were ſente
by a notable ſquyer of the duke of Berreys to
the vycount of Meaulx / who receyued them
and opened them. Than the vycount cauſed
them to be redde before ſuche lordes as were
there with hym / whyle the meſſanger was a
drinkynge. for they made hym good chere / for
the loue of the duke of Berrey / as it was reaſon.
Sirs quod the vycounte / we ſhall nat be
in reſt ſyth the duke of Berrey wyll beare Aymergot
who is the man of the world that this
twelue yere hath moſte gr
                  •
               ued and traueyled
the coūtrey of Auuergne. I had thought that
the duke had hated hym greatly / but it ſemeth
nay / ſythe he hath 
                  •
               rpreſly cōmaunded that I
ſhulde departe fro hence. But by my faythe at
this tyme I wyll nat obey this letter / but I
wyll make excuſe by reaſon of the kynge and
his coūſayle / who ſent me hyder and at my departynge
fro Parys he ſtraytly cōmaunded
me that for any cōmaundemente fro any perſone / 
and if it were nat fro the kynge kymſelfe / 
that I ſhulde nat departe fro hence tyll I had
taken the ſtronge holde of the Roche of Vandoys / 
and Aymergot therin / whiche I wyll
do if I canne / and nowe the duke of Berrey
cōmaundeth me the contrary / for he chargeth
me incontynent his letters ſene / that I ſhulde
reyſe the ſyege. By my faythe I wyll nat do
it. Syr quod they that were aboute hym / ye
ſpeke royally and truely / and we ſhall abyde
with you / but we ſuppoſe the occaſion that the
duke of Berrey writeth thus for Aymergot / is
that the englyſſh ſquier and the haraulde hath
thus deſyred him to write. we thinke alſo they
haue brought letters to hym fro the kynge of
Englande / and fro the duke of Lancaſtre / as
they brought to you this other day. ye ſay well
quod the vicounte / and I ſhall knowe it if I
came. Than the duke of Berreys ſquier was
ſent for to haue his anſwere / and the vycount
ſayd to him. Pyer / I wyll well that ye knowe
that I owe obeyſaunce to the duke of Berrey / 
for he is ſo nere a kynne to the kynge that
I dare nat dyſpleaſe hym / but I and my companyons
who haue ben here theſe fyue wekes
at this ſiege to wyn this fortreſſe / and to take
the theues that be within it / by the ſtrayte cō
               maundement
of the kynge and his counſayle / 
and we haue great marueyle (and good cauſe
why) howe my lorde of Berrey dothe commaunde
vs and maketh requeſte for his enemyes / 
that we ſhulde reyſe our ſiege / by reaſon
of that we ſay generally that we ſhal gyue
enſample to all theues and robbers / ſuche as
wyll ouer ron the realme to do the worſt they
canne. Wherfore Pyer ye ſhall ſay to the duke
of Berrey fro vs all / that we are and ſhall be
redy inclyned to do any thynge that he commaundeth
vs to do / but as in this caſe I am
ſo ſtraytely enioyned and cōmaunded by the
kyng and his coūſayle to kepe this ſiege / and
to contynewe it tyll I haue the fortreſſe and
them within at my pleaſure / whiche cōmaundemente
I dare nat brake. and ſay that ſurely
I wyll obey to no cōmaundement / but alonely
to the kynges whoſe ſubget Iame / and by
whome I am ſente hyther. But ſir I requyre
you ſhewe me one thynge if ye can / who hath
made this requeſt for Aymergotte Marcell / 
who hath done ſo moche yuell and anoyaunce
to the countrey of Auuergne and Lymoſyn / 
and nowe he is atrapped lyke as a traytoure
ſhulde be / and is nere come to an yuell ende / 
whiche he hathe well deſerued / for he hath erred
and done contrary to his othe. Syr quod
the ſquyer / there came to my lorde the duke of
Berrey two men of Englande / an haraulde
and another / who brought letters to my lorde
fro the kynge of Englande and fro the duke
of Lancaſtre / and they made greate requeſt
for Aymergotte. I beleue you well quod the

vycounte / it was Derby the haraulde and a
ſquyer called Herbery / they brought me this
other daye lyke letters / wherfore I ſuppoſe
that the kynge of Englande and the duke of
Lancaſtre wrote to the duke of Berrey in this
mater. wherfore ſhewe to my lorde of Berrey
that I deſyre him to conſydre all thinges well / 
for all theſe requeſtes that are come fro the other
ſyde of the ſee / are but deſyres purchaſed
by our enemyes / to the which no lorde on this
ſyde the ſee (if he loue the honoure and profyte
of the realme of Fraunce) ſhulde enclyne
nor condyſcende. Sir quod the ſquyer I ſhall
forget nothynge of that ye haue ſhewed me / 
for I loue nat Aymergot / I had rather ſe his
punyſſhmente thanne his delyueraunce. So
the Squyer departed and rode to Nonecte
where he founde the duke of Berrey / and dyd
his meſſage ryght ſagely / the concluſyon was
that the vycounte of Meaulx ſayde / ſurely he
wold nat departe fro the ſiege before ye Roche
of Vandoys / without the kynge ſente hym
ſtrayte commaundemente ſo to do. With this
aunſwere the duke of Berrey was nat well
contente / he had thought that as well his commaundement
ſhulde haue been obeyed / ſpecyally
in Auuergne.
            WHan the englyſſhe ſquyer and Derby
the haraulde herde of the anſwere
that was made to the duke of Berrey / 
and howe that the ſiege was nat rayſed / 
they were ſory / and ſawe well they traueyled
in vayne / than they ſayde to the duke. Syr
what wyll ye counſayle vs to do / ſhall we thus
departe frome you without ſpedynge of any
thynge to purpoſe. The kynge of Englande
and the duke of Lancaſtre haue great truſte
and affyaunce in you / that ye ſhuld cauſe this
ſiege to be reyſed / bycauſe the Roche of Vandoys
is vnder our ſignoury. Syrs quod the
duke ſuffre a ſeaſon / Aymergot Marcell is in
a ſtronge place / he nedeth nat to feare takyng / 
without a great vnhappe / and ſhortely I purpoſe
to goo in to Fraunce to the kynge / and
thanne I wyll ſpeke with the Kynge and his
counſayle / and for the loue of my coſyns of Englande / 
I ſhall do the beſte I canne to bringe
the matter to paſſe / and ye ſhall go with me
and ſe howe I ſhall ſpede. With thoſe wordes
the Squyer and the haraulde were contente.
Than the fourth day after the duke departed
fro Nonecte / and lefte there the ducheſſe his
wyfe with a gret parte of his houſeholde / and
ſo the duke rode to Ryon in Auuergne / and
there he taryed more thanne eyght dayes / for
the erle of Sanxere and the lorde Rule / who
were gone to Auignon aboute the dukes buſyneſſe.
and whan they were come they departed
fro Ryon all togyther / and toke the waye
throughe Burbonoys / and at laſte came to
Bourges in Berrey / and there the duke taryed
two dayes. Than he rode to Mehun on
the ryuer of yeure to a caſtell / one of ye fayreſt
houſes of the worlde / as thanne the duke had
newly bylte it / and it had coſte hym thre hundred
thouſande frankes. There the duke taryed
fyftene dayes / wherwith the Englyſſhe
meſſangers were ſore troubled / howbeit they
coude fynde none other remedy. The duke as
than made lytell force for the delyueraunce of
Aymergot / I ſhall ſhewe you howe and by
what meanes. So it was the erle of Sanxere
and the lorde of Rule who were chefe of the dukes
counſayle / with ſyr Peter Meſpyn / they
in fayre maner blamed the duke / and ſayde
howe he hadde nothinge to do to medell with
the buſyneſſe of Aymergot / ſayenge that his
lyfe hathe been alwayes dyſhonourable / and
howe that he was but a falſe palyarte / and alwayes
agaynſte the crowne of Fraunce / and
had doone many vyllayne dedes and roboryes
in Auuergne and in Lymoſyn / and how
that he was no mete parſone to be entreated
for / wherfore ſyr quod they / ſuffre the kynge
and his counſayle to deale with hym as they
lyſte. Theſe wordes and ſuche other refrayned
the duke of Berrey to ſpeke any further in
the mater. Howe be it the two englyſſhe men
dyd their beſt to remembre the duke. And the
duke diſſymulynge aunſwered them curteſſy
and ſayde. Syrs ſuffre a ſeaſon / we ſhall be
ſhortely at Parys. but for all his wordes he taryed
ſtyll at Mehun more thanne thre wekes
deuyſynge with his mayſter workeman: as
keruers and paynters / for therin he had great
fantaſy. He had a mayſter workeman called
maiſter Andrewe / as than one of ye beſt worke
men of the worlde / an Englyſſhe man borne / 
but he dwelte in Fraunce and in Haynalte a
longe ſeaſon.
            Nowe ſhall I ſhewe you what fortuned of
Aymergot Marcell / and of the roche of Vandoys

This Aymergot was a farre caſtynge
man / and whan he ſawe that yt ſiege was nat
reyſed / he thought well that the kyng of Englandes
meſſangers coude nat ſpede of their
ſute. than he thought on another turne as to
departe thens and to ryde nyght and daye to
ſpeke with the capitaynes of Piergourt / and
Pyerguyſe / and with Guyot of ſaint Fayth / 
and Ernalton of ſaynt Calombe / & Ernalton
of Roſtem / Iohn̄ of Morſen / Pier Danchin / 
and Remonet of Cōpayne / and with dyuers
other gaſcoyns and bernoyſe in the englyſſhe
garyſons / and he thought that with his fayre
wordes he ſhuld cauſe them to aſſemble togyther / 
and to come in to Auuergne on truſte to
wynne great botyes / and ſo on a mornyng or
in the night to come and reyſe the ſiege before
Vandoys / and to take there the frenche men
priſoners / whiche ſhulde be worthe to them a
hundred thouſande frankes / beſyde other botyes.
Thanne he ſhewed his vncle Guyot du
Sall all his purpoſe / who anſwered him and
ſayd. Sir I ſe in this nothynge but good / for
otherwyſe we can nat be delyuered fro theſe
frenche men. Well vncle ꝙ Aymergot I ſhall
do this meſſage my ſelfe ſyth ye counſayle me
therto / but I ſhall deſyre you of one thynge or
I departe. What is that quod he. It is ſo quod
Aymergot / that what ſo euer ſkrymyſſhe that
the frenche men do make / iſſue you in no wyſe
out of the gates / nor open nat your barryers / 
for and ye do / ye may rather leſe than wynne.
Sir quod Guyot I ſhalbe ware ynough ther
of / we ſhall kepe our ſelfes cloſe here within
tyll your retourne / or that we here tydynges
fro you. Well fayre vncle I requyre you ſo to
do / for they canne nat diſpleaſe vs none / otherwayes / 
as for their aſſautes or ſkrymyſſhes / 
ye nede nat feare / ſo ye kepe your ſelfes cloſe
within. Thus within thre dayes after Aymer
gote departed fro the Roche of Vandoys all
onely acōpanyed with a page / he paſſed forth
without daunger of the frenche men. his entenſyon
was to brynge thyder companyons
aduenturers to rayſe the ſiege. many of them
that were within the houſe knewe nothyng of
his departure / for he myght departe whan he
loſt without knowlege. Euery day there was
ſkrymyſſhynge and aſſautes at the barryers / 
and within a fyue or ſixe dayes after ye departure
of Aymergot / there was a great aſſaute
made by the frenche men in thre partes. This
Guyot du Sall was a good man of armes / 
and longe tyme had vſed the exerciſyng therof / 
howe be it as on that day he fortuned yuell
by reaſon of a lytell pryde / for he brake the ordynaunce
that his coſyn Aymergot had ſet or
he departed / for he had charged hym that for
any maner of aſſaute he ſhulde nat iſſue out of
the barryers. At this aſſaute there were thre
ſquyers of the french party / two of Auuergne
and one of Bretayne / who were ſkrimyſſhing
valyauntly vpon a pane of a wall nere to the
fortreſſe. Theſe thre ſquyers aboue all other
that daye dyd moſte valyauntly / they of Auuergne
were called Rycharde de la Violecte / 
and Lubinet of Rochfort / and the breton was
named Monadyke / who was taken before in
Lymoſyn in the caſtell of Vanchador / & was
parteynynge to ſir Willyam Butler. The aſſaute
endured tyll nyght. Theſe thre ſquyers
atcheued there great laude and prayſe / but for
all their traueyle & payne they wan nothyng.
Than at another aſſaute the vicount of Meaulx
made a buſſhment of twelue men of armes
and their companyes / and layde them in
an olde houſe without the fortreſſe / and commaūded
another ſorte to go and ſkrymyſſhe
at the barryers / ſayenge I thynke ſurely we
ſhall ſe them within iſſue out / for they are couetouſe
to wyn. if they do ſo / than withdrawe
your ſelfe lyt
                  •
               ll and lytell tyll they be paſt our
buſſhment / than they ſhall breke out / and alſo
retourne you agayne / thus they ſhall be encloſed
and taken or ſlayne. This is the beſt way
that I can ſe for our aduauntage. thus as the
vicount had deuyſed & ordeyned it was done / 
they were named that ſhulde lye in the buſſhment / 
as Loys of Leſglynell / Robert of Bertencourte / 
Guylliam de Saulſoy / Pyer du
ſaynt Vydall / Guyonet Villeracque / Pier of
Colle / and Iohn̄ Salmage / with other to the
nombre of twelue. They layde themſelfe in an
olde houſe without the fortreſſe / and another
ſorte went and ſkrimyſſhed at ye barryers / as
Belynot of Rochfort / Rycharde of Violecte / 
and the Monadyke with other. They were
freſſhly armed and aparelled / to thentent that
they within ſhulde haue the more corage to iſſue
out to them / they were alſo twelue alonly.
Whan they came to the bartyers they began
to ſkrymyſſhe but fayntly / and lyke ſuche perſones
as coulde but lytell ſkyll of feates of armes.
Wherfore Guyot du Sall made lytell

force of them / but iſſued out and ſayde to his
companyons▪ by ſaynt Marcell we wyll iſſue
out / for at the barryers be a ſorte of yonge cō
               panyons / 
for by that they ſhewe / they knowe
but lytell of dedes of armes / but we ſhall teche
them to knowe it / they ſhalbe all our priſoners
they can nat eſcape vs. Therwith they opened
the barryers and iſſued out / fyrſte Guyot du
Sall / and remembred nochynge the charge
that Aymergot had gyuen hym at his departynge / 
for the great deſyre that he had to do dedes
of armes / and to wynne ſomwhat / made
him to begyn the ſkrymyſſhe. whan the french
men ſawe that Guyot du Sall and his company
were come out of their barryers / they
were ryght ioyfull / than they began to drawe
backe lytell and lytell / and they of the fortreſſe
purſewed them / and they wente ſo farre that
they paſſed the buſſhment / & whan they ſawe
their tyme they brake out of their buſſhment / 
bytwene them and the fortres / cryeng Coucy
the vycount. Thus they of the fortreſſe were
incloſed both before and behynd. whan Guyot
ſawe that / he knewe well he had doone a
myſſe / and ſawe well it was harde for hym to
ſcape / than he reculed to get agayne to his garyſon / 
but the frenchemen were in his waye.
Whervnto ſhulde I make longe proceſſe / they
were all taken / nat one eſcaped. They were
brought to the vycountes lodginge before the
knyghtes / who hadde great ioye of their takynge.
            THus by the counſayle of the bycount
of Meaulx / Guyot du Sall and his
company were atrapped & taken and brought
before the lordes of Fraunce and Auuergne.
Whan the vycount ſawe Guyot du Sall / he
demaunded where Aymergot Marcell was / 
and charged hym to ſaye the trouthe / for he
thought he had ben ſtill in the fortreſſe. Guyot
du Sall aunſwered / howe he coulde nat tell
where he was / for he was departed a twelue
dayes paſte. Than the lordes thought ſurely
that he was gone to purchace ſome ayde. than
the priſoners were cōmaunded a parte / and
the vicount demaūded of the knightes of Auuergne
what were beſte to do with Guyot du
Sall and with his company / ſayenge howe
he wolde vſe hymſelfe acordyng to their counſayle.
Than ſyr Willyam Butler aunſwered
and ſayde. Syr quod he / I ſuppoſe that Aymergot
is gone for ſocour and to rayſe by the
companyons in the garyſons of Pyergourt
& Pierguyſe / for he ſhall fynde ſome alwayes
there to come vpon vs earely or late / or we beware
of theym / wherby they maye do vs domage / 
for any peace or trewce that is taken.
This Aymergot is a ſubtyle man. ſyr let vs
do one thyng / ſhew vnto Guyot du Sall and
his company / that without they cauſe they fortreſſe
to be rendred in to your handes / that ye
wyll ſtryke of all their heedes incontynente / 
and without they do thus let it nat be ſpared.
This counſayle is good quod the vycounte / 
for in dede the chefe occaſyon that we become
hyder for is to haue this fortreſſe / and though
we can nat haue at this tyme Aymergot Marcell / 
another ſeaſon ſhall fortune ryght well.
Than the vycount and the lorde of the towre / 
ſyr Roberte Dolphyn and other came before
the fortreſſe as nere as they myght aporche / 
and thyder was brought Guyot du Sall and
his company. Than the vycount ſpake and
ſayd to Guyot du Sall. Guyot and all other
of your company / knowe we for trouthe that incontynent
all your heedes ſhall be ſtryken of / 
without ye yelde vp the fortreſſe of the Roche
of Vandoys / and if ye wyll rendre it vp we
ſhall ſuffre you to go quyte. Nowe aduyſe ye
well what way ye wyll take / other lyfe or deth.
Of thoſe wordes Guyot & his company were
ſore abaſſhed / at laſt they thought it was beſt
for them to ſaue their lyues. Than Guyot anſwered
and ſayde. Syr I ſhall do the beſt I
canne that the fortreſſe may be yelden to you.
Than he came to the barryer and ſpake with
them that were within / who rekened themſelfes
clene dyſcomfyted / ſeynge they hadde loſt
their two mayſters / and the beſt of their company.
As ſoone as Guyot hadde ſpoken with
theym / and declared what caſe they ſtode in / 
they agreed to yelde vp the fortreſſe condicionally / 
yt they myght departe with bagge and
baggage as moch as they coulde cary / and to
haue reſpyte for a moneth to withdrawe them
whyther they lyſte. All this was graunted to
them / and a ſute ſaueconducte made and ſealed.
Thus the frenche men had the Roche of
Vandoys delyuered / by reaſon of their good
fortune of their laſt ſkrimyſſhe / wherfore it is
comenly ſayde / that all fortunes good and yuell
falleth often tymes in armes / to them that
foloweth warre.
            
               
WHan the Roche of Vandois was yelded
vp to the lordes of Fraunce and
Auuergn
                  •
                they of the countrey were
ryght ioyous therof and the lordes helde well
and truely the promeſſe that they had made to
Guyot du Sall▪ whan they had caryed away
as moche as they coulde do / than they departed
with good aſſuraunce for a moneth to go
whyder it pleaſed them. Than the vycount of
Meaul
                  •
                abandoned the Roche of Vandoys
to the men of the countrey / who incontynente
dyd raſe it downe in ſuche wyſe that they lefte
no wall hele nor houſe / nor ſtone vpon ſtone / 
but all was reuerſed to the erthe. The frenche
men that were they in the kinges ſeruice with
the vycount / toke their leues of the knyghtes
and ſquyers of Auuergne / ſo they departed / 
and they of Auuergne and Lymoſyn went to
their owne houſes. The vycount of Meaul
                  •
               
gaue leaue to parte of his company / & he went
to Rochell and lodged at ſaint Iohans Dangle
/ to kepe there the fronter / for in the coūtrey
there were ſome pyllers and robbers that ran
ſometyme in to Xantoigne / whan they ſawe
their aduauntage. In the maner and fourme
as I haue ſhewed you ye fortreſſe of the roche
of Vandoys was cōquered / and raſed downe
wherof all the countrey was ioyfull / for than
they were in better ſuretie than they were before.
For to ſay the trouth if it had cōtynued / it
wolde haue done them many diſpleaſurs. Tydynges
of this dede came to the knowledge
of the duke of Berrey to Cautelon / a place of
his owne / ſtandynge bytwene Charters and
Mount le Herrey / a nyne leages fro Parys / 
he cared nothing for it / for he was as than but
colde to are any grace of the kynge for Aymergot.
Whan Derby the haraulde was infourmed
by ſome of the dukes knyghtes howe the
Roche of Vandois was taken & beten downe / 
than he ſayde to the ſquyer that came thyder
with hym. ſyr ye haue loſt a hundred frankes
that Aymergot had promyſed to you. Howe
ſo quod the ſquier. Surely quod the harauld
the Roche of Vandoys is gyuen vp and rendred / 
the frenche men haue wonne it / therfore
lette vs take our leaue of the duke of Berrey / 
and retourne in to Englande / we haue nothynge
here to do. Well quod the ſquyer ſythe
it is ſo I accorde therto. Than they toke their
leaue of the duke. Than the duke wrote to the
kynge of Englande and to the duke of Lancaſtre / 
and gaue to the haraulde at his departynge
.xl. frankes / and to the ſquyer a horſe.
Thus they departed and toke the next waye
to Calays / and ſo in to Englande. Than tydinges
came to Aymergot Marcell where he
was purchaſyng of frendes to haue reyſed the
ſiege before the fortreſſe of Vandoys / that it
was gyuen vp. Whan he herde therof / he demaunded
howe it fortuned. It was ſhewed
hym howe it was by reaſon of a ſkrymyſſhe / 
and by the iſſuyng out of his vncle Guyot du
Sall vnaduyſedly. Ah that olde traytour ꝙ
Aymergot / by ſaynte Marcell if I had hym
here nowe / I ſhulde ſle hym myne owne handes / 
he hath dyſhonoured me and all my companyons.
At my departynge I ſtraytely enioyned
hym that for no maner of aſſaute or
ſkrymyſſhe made by the frenchmen / he ſhulde
in no wyſe open ye barryers / and he hath done
the contrary. this domage is nat to be recouered / 
nor I wote nat whether to go / they of Caluſet
and they of Douſac wyll kepe the peace / 
and my companyons be ſpredde abrode lyke
men dyſcomfyted / they dare neuer aſſemble agayne
togyther / and though I had them togyther / 
yet I wote nat whyder to bring them.
Thus all thynge conſydred I am in a harde
parte / for I haue gretly dyſpleaſed the french
kynge / the duke of Berrey / and the lordes of
Auuergne / & all the people of the countrey / for
I haue made them warre the peace durynge / 
I had truſted to haue won / but I am nowe
in a great aduenture to leſe / nor I wotte nat
to whom to reſorte to are counſayle. I wolde
nowe that I and my goodes / with my wyfe
were in Englande / there I ſhulde be in ſurety.
but howe ſhulde I get thyder and cary all
my ſtufe with me / I ſhulde be robbed twenty
tymes or I coulde gette to the ſee / for all the
paſſages in Poictou / in Rochell / in Fraunce / 
in Normandy / and in Pycardy are ſtraytely
kept / it wyll be harde to ſcape fro takyng / and
if I be taken I ſhall be ſente to the Frenche

thynke the ſureſt waye for me were to drawe

good thyder / and to abyd there tyll the warre
renewe agayne / for I haue good hoope that
after this treuce / warre ſhall be open agayne
bytwene Englande and Fraunce. Thus Aymergot
Marcell debated the matter in hym
ſelfe / he was heuy and ſorowfull / and wyſ
                  •
               e

nat what waye to take / outher to recouerſōe

& to ſende 
                  •
               or his wire thider / and for his
goodes lytell and lytell ſecretely. if he hadde
done ſo he had taken the ſureſt waye / But he
dyde contrary / and therby loſt all: lyfe & godes.
Thus 
                  •
               ortune payeth the people whan
ſhe hath ſette thē on the higheſt parte of her
whele / for ſodainly ſhe reuerſeth them to the
loweſt parte / enſample by this Aymergotte.
It was ſayd he was well worthe a hundred
thouſande frakes / and all was loſt on a daye
Wherfore I may well ſaye that fortune hath
played her pagiaunt with hym / as ſhe hath
done with many mo / and ſhall do. This Aymergot
in all his trybulaci
                  •
               s remēbred hym
ſelfe / howe he had a coſyn germayne in Auuergne
/ a ſquyer named Tourne myne / and
determyned to go to hym and to ſhewe hym
all his trouble / and to take counſayle of him
as he deuyſed ſo he dyd. He and his page all
onely came to ye caſtell where Tourne myne
was / thynkyng to haue ben there in ſuretie / 
bicauſe of lynage / but it proued contrary / for
this ſquyer was nat in the duke of Berryes
grace nor fauor. Whan he ſawe his coſyn Aymergot
in his houſe / he aduyſed to take hym
priſoner & to aduertyſe the duke of Berey / yt
if he wolde forgyue hym his diſpleaſure & yuell
wyll / he wolde ſend hym Aymergot mercell / 
to do with hym his pleaſure. And as he
had deuyſed ſo he dyde / for whan Aymergot
was within his coſyns Caſtell and brought
to a chābre / than he layde by his ſwerde and
chaunged his aparyll: than he demaūded of
the ſeruauntes and ſayd. Where is my coſyn
Tourne myne / as yet I haue nat ſene hym?
Sir quod they he is in his chambre pleaſe it
you to come and ſe hym: with ryght a good

knewe ryght well their mayſters pleaſure.
Whan Aymergot had chaunged his aparell
and doone of a Cote of defence / that he was
wo
                  •
               t vſualy to weare / and layde awaye his

wolde ſe my coſyn Tourne myne / it is long
ſithe I ſawe hym. they brought him ſtreight
to Tourne myne / and whan he came to hym
Aymergot dyde ſalute hym / as he that thought

and ſaide. Howe is it Aymergotte▪
Who ſente for you to come hyder? ye wolde

                  •
               
and alſo encloſed in the caſtell. For any wordes
that he coulde ſaye / there he was taken &
yrons putte vpon his legges and layde in a

            WHan this was done he cauſed the caſtell
gate to be ſhytte / and toke the
keyes hym ſelfe. And commaunded
all his ſeruauntes on payne of their lyues / 
none of them to be ſo hardy to go to the gate
without he ſent them thyder. His comaandement
was vpholde. Than he wrote letts
at his pleaſure / dyrected to the duke of Berrey:
Certifyeng hym howe he hadde Aymergot

to go in to Fraunce to the duke of Berrey / &
to delyuer hym his letter / and to recōmende
hym lowly to hym / and nat to retourne with

and moūted on a good horſe and ſo deꝑted / &
rode ſo longe that he came to Parys / where
the duke of Berey was / and there delyuered
to hym his maiſters letter. The duke toke ye
letter and reed it and ſmyled there at / & ſayd
to ſuche knyghtes as were about hym. ſ

wyll ye here newe tidynges? Aymergot marcell
is taken priſoner his owne coſyn germayne
Tourne myne hath taken hym: ye knightes
anſwered and ſayd. ſir / it is good tidynges
for the countrey of Auuergne & of Lymoſyn / 
for they haue had of hym a longe ſeaſon
an yuell neyghbour. He hath done ſo moche
yuell / that if it pleaſe you he were worthy to
peyſe the gybet: he ought to haue none other
raunſome nor pardon. I can nat ſaye ꝙ the
duke what the kyng and his counſayle wyll
ſaye therto / I wyll ſpeke with them therin.
It was nat longe after but that the duke of
Berrey toke a barge on the ryuer of Seyne
and ſo came to the caſtell of Lour where the
kyng and his coūſaile was: he ſhewed there
theſe newes / he cauſed the letter that Turne
myne had ſent hym to be reed / of the whiche
tidynges euery man was ioyfull / and the lordes
ſaide. it is well ſene that ſuche maner of
robbers and pillers can neuer cōe to a good
ende. Than the duke of Berey was deſyred
to ſende for hym by the ſeneſchall of Auuergne / 
and to be brought to Paris / & to be put
in ye caſtell of ſaynt Antonies. Furthermore
it was ordayned / that Tourne myne / for the
good ſeruice he hadde done to the crowne of
Fraūce / that all diſpleaſures ſhulde be clene
for gyuen hym: and thervpon letters patentes
were made & ſent to hym by his ſeruaunt
wherof he was well content / and truſted on
thoſe letters. Than with in a ſhorte ſpace after
/ the ſeneſchall of Auergne by a cōmiſſion
fro the duke of Berrey came to the caſtell of
Tourne myne / & there Aymergot Marcell
was delyuered to hym / wherof Aymergotte
was ſore abaſſhed / whan he ſawe hym ſelfe
in the cōpany of his enemies. Wherto ſhulde
I make lōge proceſſe / the ſeneſhall caried
hym with men of armes a long through the
countrey / and paſſed the ryuers of Seyne
and Marewe / by the bridge of Charenton / 
and ſo fro thens to the caſtell of ſaynt Antonies.
There the Vicount Darchy was charged
with hym who as than̄e was capitayne
of that caſtell. He kepte hym nat long but yt
he was delyuered to the prouoſt of the Chatelet
of Parys. And trewe it was / Aymergot
offred for his raunſome threſcore thouſande
frankes / but it wolde nat be taken / He
was anſwered the kyng was riche ynough.
After that he was ſente to the Chatelette / he
was nat long kepte there but that he was iuged
to dye ſhamefully lyke a traytour to the
Crowne of Fraunce. And ſoo on a daye he
was caryed in a chariot to a place called the
Halles / and there ſette on the pyllary. Than
all his treſpaſſes were reed before hym / and
by hym was ſir Wylliam of Trune who ſpake
moche to hym. It was thought / yt it was
to knowe the ſtate of certayne capitayns in
Auuergne / and whether they were conſentyng
to his dedes or nat. The lordes knewe
well / but I coude neuer haue knowlege therof.
Thus he was executed. His heed ſtryken
of and his body quartred / and the quarters
ſette at euery gate of Parys. To this ende
came Aymergotte Marcell. As of his wyfe
and of his goodes / I knewe nat what becāe
further of them.

            ¶Howe the chryſten lordes and the

of Aufryke in Barbary / and howe
they maynteyned the ſiege.
Cap. C.lxxi.
            
               WHere as I haue ſpoken
at length of the lyfe of Aymergot
Mercell / it was to
furnyſſhe this hyſtorie. for
the condycions bothe of yuell
and good / ought to be
alwayes treated in a hyſtory / 
and ſpecially whan it toucheth any great
feate / for enſample of other / and to gyue mater
and occaſyon to do well: For if Aymergotte
had ledde his lyfe in good vertues / he
had ben a man of great valure / and bycauſe
he dyde the cōtrary he came to an yuell ende.
¶ Nowe let vs leaue ſpekyng of hym / & let
vs retourne to the hyghe enterprice that the
Chriſten knyghtes of Fraunce and other nacyous
dyd in that ſeaſon in the realme of Aufryke / 
& I wyll begyn there as I lefte. The
ſayd lordes aſſembled in the yſle of Conymbres.
after they had paſſed the tempeſtes and
paryls in the Goulfe of Lyon: there they taryed

eche for other / for there were in the cytie
of Aufryke a .xxx. thouſande. In this yſle of
Conymbres they were a nyne dayes & refreſſhed
them: and there the patrons of the galees
ſayde to the lordes. Sirs / we be in the
lande next aprochyng to the marcheſſe of Aufryke / 
whider by the grace of god ye are purpoſed
to go and laye liege. Wherfore it is behouable
to take co
                  •
               ſayle eche of other / howe
we maye entre in to the hauen / & to take lāde
To ſaue our ſelfe it is beſt we ſenoe formaſt
our lytell ſhyppes / called Brigandyns / and
let vs tary in the mouthe of the hauyn / ye firſt
day that we aproche and all the nyght after / 
and the nexte mornynge to take lande / by the
grace of god at our leyſar / & than lodge our
ſelfes as nere the cytie as we maye / without
the ſhotte of their artyllary / and let vs ſette
our croſbowes genouois in order / who ſhal
be redy to defende all ſcirmyſſhes. And we
ſuppoſe well that whan we ſhall take ladynge / 
ye haue here ī your cōpanyes many yong
ſquyers / who to enhaūce their honours wyll
requyre to haue the order of knighthode. In
ſtructe them wiſely and ſwetely / howe they
ſhall mentayne themſelfes. And my lordes / 
knowe for trouthe / that all we ſee men ſhall
acquyte vs vnto you well and truely / and alwayes
ſhewe you by what maner of order / 
we ſhall mooſt greue our enemyes. And we
ſhall take payne and ſtudy howe the cytie of
Aufryke may be won / for ofte tymes they haue
done vs great dōmage. For on that coſte
it is the chiefe key of Barbary / and of the realmes
that foloweth. Firſt the realme of Aufrike / 
of Mallorques / and of Bougy. And if
god of his grace wyll conſent that we maye
wyn this cytie of Aufrike / all the Sarazyns
wyll trymble to the realme of Liby & Sury / 
ſo that all the worlde ſhall ſpeke therof. And
by the ayde of other chriſten realmes & yſles
marchyng nere to Aufrike / we ſhall always
be refreſhed with vitayls and newe men / for
this is a cōmon vo
                  •
               age / For euery man wyll
deſyre dayly to do dedes of armes / and ſpecially
on goddes enemyes: and thus in the cō
               cluſion
of their proceſſe the patrons ſaid. lordes / 
we ſay nat this by no preſūpcion / nor by
maner as to teche you what ye ſhuld do. but
this that we haue ſayd is all onely for loue &
by humilyte / for ye be all noble men ſage and
valyant / & can better order euery thyng than
we can deuyſe and ſpeke. Than the lorde of
Coucy ſaid. ſirs / your good counſayle & aduyſe
ought gretly to content vs / for we ſe no
thyng therin but good. And ſirs / be ye ſure
that we ſhall do nothyng without your coū
               ſayle / 
for ye haue brought vs hyder to do dedes
of armes.
            THus in the preſence of the duke of
Burbone / the lordes and other coū
               ſayled
toguyder in the yſle of Conymbres / 
how they myght aproche ye ſtrong
towne of Aufryke. Whan euery thyng was
well aduyſed and ſette in good order by the
admyrall and patrons of the galees / & that
wynde and wether ſerued them / euery lorde
entred in to his galee amōg their owne men
hauyng great deſyre to encoūtre with their
enemyes the ſarazyns. Than the trūpettes
blewe vp at their departyng. It was great
pleaſure to beholde their ores / howe they rowed
abrode in the ſee / whiche was peaſable / 
calme and fayre / ſo that in maner the ſee ſhewed
her ſelfe that ſhe had great deſyre yt the
chriſten men ſhulde come before the ſtronge
towne of Aufryke. The chriſten nauy was
goodly to regarde & well ordred / and it was
great beautie to ſe the baners and penons of
ſilke / with the armes and badges of ye lordes
and other wauyng with the wynde / and ſhynyng
agaynſt the ſon̄e. And within an hour
of noone / the chriſten men perceyued ye hygh
towres of the towne of Aufrike / & the farder
they ſayled the nerer it ſhewed to their ſyghtes / 
wherfore euery man reioyſed and good
cauſe why / ſeyng all they deſyred to cōe thyder.
They thought thā in a maner their paynes
releaſed & their voyage accomplyſſhed.
Thus as they aproched to thentre of the realme
of Aufryke / they cōmuned & deuyſed among
themſelfe. and in lyke maner the ſarazyns
that were within the towne of Aufryke
ſpake and deuyſed and were ſore abaſſhed / 
whan they ſawe their enemies aproche with
ſuche a nombre of ſayles & ſayde / that ſurely
they were lykely to be beſieged / Howe be it
they thought their towne ſo ſtrōg with towres
and walles / & with artyllary / that therwith
they reconforted and toke corage. And
to gyue warnyng to the countrey (as ſoone
as they ſawe their enemyes on the See / on
the hyghe towres) They ſowned Tymbres

and tabours / accordynge to their vſage / in
ſuche wyſe / that the men abrode in the countrey
drewe toguyder. Suche men of Barbary
as had ben ſente thyder by the kynge of
Aufryke / and by the kynge of Thunes and
Bougy. Whan they knewe of the Chriſten
mennes cōmynge / by reaſon of the noyſe of
the Tymbres and tabours / to thentent that
they ſhulde nat entre to farre in to their coū
               treis.
Euery man tooke hede to his charge &
ſente certayne of their capitayns to the See
ſyde / to ſe the aprochyng of ye Chriſten men / 
and to beholde their dealyng that nyght. Alſo
they prouyded to defende the towres and
gates about the hauyn of Aufryke / to the entent
that by their negligēce the towne of Aufryke
ſhulde take no dōmage / whiche towne
was ſo ſtrong / that it was nat lykely to take
great hurte without longe ſiege. And I Iohan
Froyſſart auctour of this cronycle / bycauſe
I was neuer in Aufryke / and bycauſe
I myght truely write the maner and faſcion
of this enterprice. Alwayes I deſyred ſuche
knyghtes and ſquyers as had ben at ye ſame
voyage / to enforme me of euery thyng. And
bycauſe I had been oftentymes in my dayes
at Calays / I demaunded alſo of ſuche there
as had ben at the ſayde voyage. And it was
ſhewed me of a ſuretie / that the ſarazyns amonge
them ſelfes ſayde / howe the Chriſten
men that were there were expert and ſubtyle
men of armes. Whervpon an auncyent ſarazyn
ſayd to all his company. Sirs / all thynges
cōſydred / it is beſt that the Chriſten men
at the begynnyng ſe nat our ſtrength and puiſſaunce / 
nor alſo we haue nat men ſuffyciēt
to fyght with them / but daylye men wyll cōe
to vs. Wherfore I thynke it beſt to ſuf
                  •
               re thē
to take lāde: they haue no horſes to ouer ron
the countrey: they wyll nat ſprede abrode / 
but kepe togyder for feare of vs. The towne
is ſtronge ynoughe and well prouyded / we
nede nat feare any aſſautꝭ. The ayre is hote
and wyll be hotter. They are lodged in the
ſonne and we in the ſhadowe: and they ſhall
dayly waſt their vitaylles / and ſhalbe with
               
                  •
               ute
hope to recouer any newe / and they lye
here any long ſeaſon. And we ſhall haue plē
               tie
for we be in our owne countrey. and they
ſhall oftētymes be awaked and ſcrimyſſhed
withall / to their dōmage and to our aduauntage.
Lette vs nat fight with them / for other
wyſe they can nat diſconfyte vs. They haue
nat ben vſed with the ayre of this countrey / 
whiche is contrary to their nature. I thynke
this the beſt waye.
            TO the ſaieng of this aūcient knight
ſarazyn all other agreed. Than̄e it
was cōmaunded on payne of dethe
that no man ſhulde go to the ſee ſyde to ſcrymyſſhe
with the Chriſten men without they
were cōmaunded / but to kepe them ſelfe cloſe
in their lodgynges / & ſuffre the chriſten men
to take lande. This determynacion was vp
holde none durſt breke it. And they ſent a certayne
of their archers in to the towne of Aufryke / 
to ayde to defende it. The Sarazyns
ſhewed theme ſelfes nothyng / as though ther
had been no men in the countrey. The Chriſten
men lodged all that night in the mouthe
of the hauyn of Aufryke / and the nexte mornynge
the wether was fayre and clere / and
the ayre in good temper / and the ſonne roſe / 
that it was pleaſure to beholde. Than̄e the
Chriſten men began to ſtyrre / and made thē
redy / hauynge great deſyre to approche the
towne of Aufryke and to take lande. Than
trumpettes and claryons began to ſowne in
the Gallees and veſſelles / and made great
noiſe: and about nyne of the clocke whan the
chriſten men had taken a lytell refreſſ hynge
with drinke: than were they reioyſed & lighted.
And accordyng as they had apoynted before / 
they ſent in fyrſt their lyght veſſelles called
Brigandyns / well furniſſhed with artyllary.
They entred in to the hauyn / and after
them came the armed Galees / and the other
ſhyppes of the flete in good order. and tournyng
towardes the lande by the ſee ſyde / ther
was a ſtrong caſtell with hyghe towres / and
ſpecially one towre whiche defended the ſee
ſyde / and the lande alſo. And in this towre
was a bricoll or an engyn whiche was nat ydell / 
but ſtyll dyde caſt great ſtones amonge
the Chriſten mens ſhyppes. In lyke wiſe in
euery towre of the towne agaynſt the See
ſyde / there were engyns to caſte ſtones. the
ſarazyns had well prouyded for their towne
for they loked euer longe before whane they
ſhulde be beſieged. Whan the Chriſten men
entred in to the hauen of Aufryke to take lande
/ it was a pleſaunt ſyght to beholde their
order / and to here the claryons and trumpettes

ſounde ſo hyghe and clere / dyuers knightes
and valyaunt men of the realme of Fraū
               ce / 
ſprede abrode that day their baners / with
dyuers other newe made knyghtes. The lorde
Iohan of Lignye was there firſte made
knight. He was of the countrey of Chauny.
He was made by the handes of a coſyn of his
named ſir Henry Dantoygne / and there he
ſprede abrode firſt his baner: The felde golde / 
a bende of goules. And in his companye
was his coſyn germayne the lorde of Hauret
in Chauny. Thus the lordes knyghtes and
ſquyers with great deſyre auaunced them / &
toke lande and lodged on the lande of their
enemyes in the ſight of the falſe ſarazyns. on
a wedniſdaye in the euenyng of Mary Magdaleyne / 
in the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred & fourſcore. And as they
toke lāde they were lodged by their marſhalles.
The ſarazyns that were within ye towne
prayſed moche the chriſten mēnes order: and
bycauſe that the great Galees coulde nat aproche
nere to the lande / the men yſſued out
in bottes / and toke lande and folowed the baner
of our lady.
            THe Sarazins that were within the
towne / and ſuche as were abrode in
the countrey / ſuffered the Chriſten
men peſably to take lande / for they ſawe well
it ſhulde nat be for their aduauntage to haue
fought with them at their landyng. The duke
of Burbone who was as chefe of the chriſten
armye there / was lodged in the myddes
of his company ryght honorably / his baner
diſplayed poudred full of Floure du Lyces / 
with an ymage of our Lady in the myddes / 
and a ſcochynne with the armes of Burbone
vnder the fete of the ymage. ¶ Fyrſte on the
ryght hande of the duke / there was lodged
his brother ſir Guylliam of Tremoyle with
his penon / and the lorde of Bordenay with
his baner / and ſir Helyon of Lygnacke with
his penon / the lorde of Tourſe with a penon
And than the Henowers with the ſtanderde
of the lorde Wyllyam of Heynaulte / as than
erle of Oſtrenaunt / eldeſt ſonne to the duke
Aubert of Bauyere / erle of Heynaulte. Of
Hollande and of zelande / the deuyſe in ye ſtanderde
was a Herſe golde / ſtandyng on a bell
goules. There was the lorde of Haureth wt
his baner / the lorde of Ligny with his baner
and than ſir Philyppe Dartoys erle of Ewe
with baner / the lorde of Mateſelon with baner / 
the lorde of Calam with penon / the Seneſchall
of Ewe with penon / the lorde of Lynyers
with baner / the lorde of Thune with
baner / the lorde of Ameuall with baner / ſir
Water of Champenon with penon / ſir Ioh
                  •
               
of the Caſtell Morant with baner / the marſhall
of Sanxeres brother with penon / the
lorde of Coucy with baner / beſte apoynted
nexte the duke of Burbone / ſir Stephyne of
Sanxere with penon. Than the Frēche kynges
penon with his deuyce / and therby was
ſir Iohan of Barroys / with the penon of his
armes. Than ſir Guylliam Morles with baner / 
and the lorde of Lōgueuall with penon / 
ſir Iohan of Roye with baner / the lorde of
Bourſe with penon / the Vycount Dauſney
with baner / the lorde admyrall with baner /

all theſe baners and penons were ſette in the
front before ye towne of Aufryke / and beſyde
that a great nombre of other knyghtes and
ſquyers ryght valyaunt men and 
                  •
               fhighe corage / 
were lodged abrode in the felde / I cannat
name them all / alſo it wolde be to long a
writyng. There were a fourtene thouſande
all gentylmen. It was a companye to do a
great feate / and to ſuſteyne a great batyle / if
the ſarazyns had come forthe to haue gyuen
them batayle / whiche they dyd nat / for as on
yt day they ſhewed no maner of defence / but
caſtyng out of their towres great ſtones.
            WHan the Chriſten men were lodged
as well as they myght / & refreſſhed
them ſelfes with ſuche as they had
brought with them / for they myght nat ryn
abrode in the countrey to gather bowes of
trees to make with all their lodgynges / 
                  •
               or
it had ben to their domage if they had aduentured
themſelfe abrode. The lordes had tentes
and pauiliōs that they had brought with
them fro Geane. Thus they lodged in good
order. the croſbowes of the genouoys were
lodged on the wynges / and cloſed in the lordes.
They occupyed a great ſpace of groūde
for they were a great nombre / all their prouiſyons
were in the galees / and all the day the
maryners conueyed their ſtuffe to 
                  •
               ande by
bottes. And whan the chriſten yſles adioynyng / 
as Naples
                  •
                Cicyll / and alſo the mayne
landes / as Puylle and Calabre. Whan they
knewe howe the Chriſten men had beſieged
the ſtrong caſtell of Aufryke / they dyd what
they coude to vitayle the chriſten army. ſome
to haue aduaūtage therby / and ſome for loue
and affection that they had to the genouoys / 
fro the yſle of Caude came to them the good
malueyſies in great plenty / without whiche
conforte they coude nat longe haue endured / 
for they were a great nombre / and good drinkers
and good caters / Howe be it their prouiſ
                  •
               ons
came nat alwayes to thē in lyke maner / 
for ſomtyme they had plentie and ſome
ſeaſon they wanted. ¶ Nowe I ſhall ſomwhat
ſpeke of the ſarazyns aſwell as I haue
done of the chriſten men / as it is reaſon to cō
               clude
all thynges.
            Trewe it was that they of Aufrike and of
Barbary knewe longe before howe the genowayes
hadde thretned them / and they loked
for none other thyng / but the ſame yere to be
beſieged / as they were in dede. They hadde
made prouiſyon to reſyſt agaynſt it. & whan
the tidynges were ſprede abrode in the countrey
howe that the chriſtenmen were come to
Aufryke they were in dout / for he is nat wiſe
that feareth nat his ennemyes thoughe they
be neuer ſo fewe. Howe be it the ſarazyns reputed
the chriſten men right valyant & good
men of warre / wherfore they greatly douted
them: and to the entent to reſyſt & to defende
the fronters of their countreys / they aſſembled
toguyder of dyuers parties / as they of
the lande and ſeignorie of Aufrike and of the
realme of Maroche / and of ye realme of Bougye / 
the beſt men of warre in all thoſe countreis / 
and ſuche as leeſt feared dethe. Thus
they came and lodged on the ſandes agaynſt
the chriſten men / and they had behynde them
an highe wode / to thentent that they ſhulde
receyue on that ſyde no dōmage by meanes
of buſſhmentes or ſcrimyſſhes. Theſe ſarazins
lodged them ſelfes right ſagely & ſurely
they were of men of warre a .xxx. thouſande
good archers / and ten thouſande horſemen
and mo. Howe be it the Chriſten men coude
neuer knowe ſurely what nombre they were
for they ſuppoſed they had a greater nombre
lodged in the woodes / whiche myght ryght
well be. For they were in their owne coūtre
and might go and come in to their hoſt at all
houres without paryll or dommage at their
owne lybertie. They were often tymes refreſſhed
with newe vitayls brought to them
on ſomers and camelles. And the ſecōde day
that the Englyſſhe men had been a lande / in
the mornyng at the breke of the day / and that
the ſame nyght the lorde Henry Dautoygne
had kepte the watche with two hundred men
of armes and a thouſande croſbowes genowayes.
The ſarazyns came to awake and to
ſcrimyſſhe with theym / whiche endured the
ſpace of tow houres. There were many dedes
of armes atchyued / but ye ſarazins wolde
nat ioyne to fyght hande to hande / but they
ſcrimyſſhed with caſtyng of dartes and ſhotynge / 
and wolde nat folyſſhely aduenture
thēſelfes / but wiſely and ſagely reculed. the
chriſten hooſt than apparelled them to go to
the ſcrimyſſhe / and ſome of the great lordes
of Fraunce came thyder to ſe the deme anour

of the ſarazyns / therby to know a n
                  •
               ther tyme
their maner in ſkrymyſſhynge. Thus the ſarazyns
drewe to their lodgynge and the cryſten
men to theirs. And durynge the ſiege the
cryſten men were neuer in ſuretie nor reſt / for
outher euenynge or mornynge the ſarazyns
wolde awake them and ſkrymyſſhe. Amonge
the ſarazyns there was a yonge knight called
Agadingor Dolyferne / he was alwayes well
mounted on a redy and a lyght horſe / it ſemed
whan the horſe ranne / that he dyd flye in the
ayre. The knyght ſemed to be a good man of
armes by his dedes / he bare always of vſage
thre fedred dartes / and ryght well he coulde
handle them / and acordynge to their cuſtome
he was clene armed with a long whyte to well
aboute his heed. His aparell was blacke / and
his owne coloure browne / and a good horſeman.
The cryſten men ſayde they thought he
dyd ſuche dedes for the loue of ſome yonge lady
of his countrey. And trewe it was that he
loued entyrely the kynge of Thunes doughter / 
named the lady Azala / ſhe was enherytour
to the realme of Thunes / after ye diſceaſe
of the kyng her father. This Agadingor was
ſonne to the duke of Olyferne. I can nat tell if
they were maryed togyther after or nat / but
it was ſhewed me that this knyght for loue of
the ſayd lady durynge the ſiege dyd many feates
of armes. The knyghtes of Faunce wolde
fayne haue taken hym / but they coulde neuer
atrape nor encloſe him / his horſe was ſo ſwyft
and ſo redy to his hande yt alwaies he ſkaped.
            THe cryſten men wolde gladly haue
taken ſome ſarazyn to the entente to
haue knowen the ſtate of the towne
and countrey / but for all their ſkrymyſſhynge
they coulde neuer gette none. The ſaraſyns
toke good hede to themſelfe / and dyd paueſſe
themſelfe agaynſt the croſebowes genouoys / 
they werenat ſo well armed as the criſten men
it was nat their vſage / nor they had no armorers
nor metall to forge harneſſe withall / for
moſt comenly they lacke yron and ſteele / they
be euer armed in lether / and beare targettes aboute
their neckes couered and made of Cure
boley of Capadoce / no wepen can perce it and
the lether be nat hote. ſo that whan they come
nere to their enemyes they caſt their dartes all
at ones. And whan the genouoys do ſhote at
theym / than they couche them ſelfe lowe and
couer them with their targes / and whan the
ſhotte is paſte / than they caſte agayne their fedred
dartes. Thus the ſpace of nyne wekes
durynge the ſiege they often tymes ſkrymyſſhed / 
ſo that dyuers were hurte on bothe parties / 
and ſpecially ſuche as lyghtly without a
uyſement aduentured them ſelfe. thus the cryſten
men toke good hede to themſelfe / and ſo
dyd the ſarazyns on their parte / and the lordes
of Fraunce and ſuche other as were com
                  •
               
thyder to their ayde / gladly regarded the dealynge
of the ſarazyns. To ſaye the trouthe to
lordes of aſtate and to gret men / all newelties
are dylectable. And if the cryſten men hadde
pleaſure to beholde them / the ſarazyns had as
great pleaſure to regarde the maner of the cryſten
men / amonge them there were yonge luſty
knyghtes / who had great pleaſure to beholde
the armure baners / ſtandardes / and penons / 
with rycheſſe and nobleneſſe that was
amonge the cryſten men / and at nyght whan
they were at their lodgynges they ſpake and
deuyſed. But as it was ſhewed me there was
one thynge amonge them to be marueyled at / 
I ſhall ſhewe you what.
            THe ſarazyns within the towne of Aufryke
had great marueyle by what
tytell or inſtaunce yt the cryſten men
came thyder ſo ſtrongly to make them warre.
It was ſhewed me howe they toke aduyſe amonge
them howe to knowe the trouth therof / 
and determyned to ſende to the cryſten men to
knowe their myndes / and ſo toke a truchman
that coulde ſpeke Italyan / and commaunded
hym to go to the cryſten hoſt / and to demaūde
of them in what tytle and inſtaunce they are
come to make vs warre / and why they be come
ſo ſtrongly in to the empyre of Barbary / and
in to the lande of Auffryke / and ſaye howe we
haue in nothynge treſpaſed them. of a trouth
afore this tyme there hath ben warre bytwene
vs and the genouoys / but as for that warre
by reaſon ought nat to touche the cryſten men
of farre countreys of. as for the genouoys are
our neyghbours / they take of vs and we of
them / we haue been auncyente enemyes and
ſhall be / excepte whan treuce is bytwene vs.
with this meſſage the trucheman departed / 
and rode to the cryſten army / and mette fyrſt
with a genoway / and ſhewed hym howe he
was a meſſanger ſent fro ye ſarazyns to ſpeke

with ſome lorde of Fraunce. The genoway
had to name Anthony Marthy / he was a centuryon
of the croſbowes / he brought this meſſanger
to the duke of Burbon and to the lorde
of Coucy / who gladly herde hym ſpeke / and
the wordes that he ſpake in his owne langage
the centuryon genoway expowned theym in
frenche. Whan this meſſanger had declared
his meſſage / he deſyred to haue an anuſwere.
The lordes of Fraunce ſayde he ſhulde haue / 
but firſt they wolde take aduyſe in the mater.
Than a .xii. of the greateſt lordes drewe togyder
to counſayle in the duke of Burbons tent / 
and concluded / and ſo ſent for the meſſanger / 
and the genouoy made him his anſwere in al
their names. Sayeng howe the tytle and quarell
that they made warre in was / bycauſe the
ſonne of god called Ieſu chryſt and trewe profyte
/ by their lyne and generacyon was put to
deth and crucyfyed / and bycauſe they had iudged
their god to deth without tytell or reaſon / 
therfore they wolde haue a mendes / and punyſſhe
that treſpace and falſe iudgement that
they of their lawe had made / and alſo bycauſe
they beleued nat in the holy baptyme / and are
euer contrary to their faythe & lawe. nor alſo
bycauſe they beleued nat in the virgyn Mary
m
                  •
               ther to Iheſu Cryſt. F
                  •
               r theſe cauſes and
other they ſayd they toke the ſarazyns and all
their ſecte for their enemyes / and ſayd howe
they wolde reuenge the diſpytes that they had
doone and dayly do to their god and cryſten
faythe. With this anſwere the treuchman retourned
without parell or domage / and ſhewed
to his mayſters all as ye haue herde. At
this aunſwere the ſarazyns dyd nothinge but
laugh / and ſayd howe that aunſwere was nothynge
reaſonable / for it was the iewes that
put Chryſt to dethe / and nat they. Thus the
ſiege ſtyll endured euery party making good
watche.
            ANone after the ſarazyns toke counſayle
togyder / and determyned that
a ſeuen or eight dayes togyther they
ſhulde ſuffre the cryſten men in reſte / and nat
to make any maner of ſkrymyſſhe with them / 
and than ſodaynly on a nyght about the hour
of mydnyght to ſette on the hooſt / truſtynge
therby to do a great feate. As they ordayned
ſo they dyd / and an eyght dayes togyther they
made no ſkrymyſſhe / and on the .ix. day about
mydnight they ſecretly armed them with ſuch
armure as they were accuſtomed to / and ſo
came cloſe togyder without any noyſe nere to
the lodgynges of the cryſten men / and had enterpryſed
to haue done a great feate / & to haue
entred / nat on that ſide that their watche was
on / but on the other parte of the felde / where
there was no watche kept. They had come to
their ententes / and god properly had nat ben
agaynſt them / in ſhewynge of apparante myracles / 
I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            As the ſarazyns aproched they ſawe ſodenly
before them a great company of ladyes and
damoſels / all in whyte colour / and one in eſpecyall
who in beauty without compariſon exceded
all the other / and there was borne before
her a baner all of whyte and reed within. with
this ſyght the ſarazyns were ſo abaſſhed that
they lacked ſpyrite and force to go any further
and ſo ſtode ſtyll / and the ladyes before them.
Alſo it was ſhewed me that the Genouoys
had a great dogge in their company that they
brought with theym / but they knewe nat fro
whence he came / there was none that chalenged
the dogge to be his / whiche dogge dyd
theym great ſeruyce / for the ſarazyns coulde
neuer come ſo pryuely to ſkrymyſſhe / but the
dogge wolde bay and make ſuche brewte that
he wold nat reſt tyll ſuch as were a ſlepe were
awaked / euery man knewe whan they herde
the dogge baye / that the ſarazyns were commyng
to ſkrymyſſhe with them / wherby euer
they aparelled them ſelfe to reſyſt them. The
genouoys called the dogge our ladies dogge.
The ſame ſeaſon that the ſarazyns ſtode ſtyll
in a traunce / and the ladyes before them this
dogge was n
                  •
               t ydell / but he made gret brute
and ranne bayeng fyrſt to the ſtande watche / 
the lorde of Coucy and ſir Henry Dantoigne
kept the watche that night. Whan euery man
herde this dogge make ſuche brute they roſe
and armed them redy / for they knew well that
the ſarazyns dyd aproche to awake them. and
trewe it was that the vyrgyn Mary and her
company was before them / to defende the cryſten
men fro all parelles / ſo that they toke that
nyght no maner of domage / for the ſarazyns
durſt nat aproche / but retourned to their lodgynges.
And after that the cryſten men toke
better hede to their watche.
            
               
THe ſarazyns knyghtes and ſquyers
ſuche as were in ye towne of Aufryke
and ſpecially ſuche as had ſene theſe
ladyes / were ſo abaſſhed that they wyſte nat
what to thynke. and the cryſten knightes and
ſquyers that lay at the ſiege / ſtudyed day and
nyght / howe they myght wyn the towne / and
they within ſtudyed agayne howe to defende
their towne. The ſeaſon was hote and drye / 
for the ſonne was in his moſte ſtrength / as in
the moneth of Auguſt / and the marches of Aufryke
are ryght hoote / by reaſon of the ſande / 
and alſo they be nerer to the ſonne than we be.
And the wynes that the cryſten men had came
fro Pulle and Calabre / and they be hote and
drye / farre fro the nature of the french wynes / 
wherby many fell in to hoote feuers. And to
conſydre acordynge to reaſon / I can nat tell
howe the frenche men and other of lowe countreys
coulde endure the payne of the hote and
groſe ayre that they founde there / without refreſſhynge
of good / ſwete / and freſſhe water / 
whiche they lacked there. yet they made fountaynes
and welles in the ſande / whiche dyde
theym great pleaſure / for there they found
                  •
               
freſſh water / how be it often tymes the water
was ſore chafed by reaſon of the heate. And
alſo often tymes they had great defaute of vytaylles / 
and ſome ſeaſon they had ynough comynge
fro Cicyll / and fro other iſles adioynynge.
Suche as werehole comforted them
that were dyſſeaſed / and ſuche as had vytayles / 
departed with theym that lacked / other
wyſe they coulde nat haue endured. they dalte
eche with other lyke bretherne and frendes.
The lorde of Coucy ſpecyally had the chyefe
reſorte of gentlemen / he coulde behaue hym
ſelfe ſwetely amonge them / moche better than
the duke of Burbone / for the duke was ſome
what of an high corage / proude and preſumptuous / 
nor ſpake nat ſo ſwetely nor ſo humbly
to knyghtes / ſquyers / and ſtraungers / as the
lorde of Coucy dyd. Moſte comenly the duke
of Burbone wolde ſytte all daye without his
tente with his legges acroſſe / and who ſo euer
wold ſpeke with hym / it behoued him to haue
a procurer / and to make great reuerence. He
conſydred nat the ſtate of poore men ſo well
as the lorde coucy dyd / wherfore he was more
in the grace and loue of the people thanne the
duke of Burbon was. And as it was ſhewed

                  •
               e by dyuers knyghtes and ſquyers ſtraungers / 
that in their opynyons if the lorde Coucy
had ben ſoueraygne capytayne alone / they
had ſped otherwyſe than they dyd / for by reaſon
of the pride of the duke of Burbon / many
feates and enterpriſes were lefte vndone. It
was the opynyon of many that he kepte hym
ſelfe ſure ynough fro takynge.
            THis ſiege enduringe before the towne
of Aufryke / whiche contynewed a .lx.
dayes and one / there was many ſkrymyſſhes
made on bothe parties 
                  •
               abrode and at the barryers
of the towne. It was nedefull for them
within to make good defēce / for againſt them
was the floure of chyualry and ſquyry. The
knyghtes aduenturers ſayd one to another.
If we maye get this towne with aſſaute or otherwyſe / 
than we may refreſſhe our ſelfes in
it all the wynter / and at ſomer some great armye
of cryſten men wyll come byther / for ther
by we and they ſhall haue a goodly entre into
the realmes of Barbary / Aufryke / and Thunes.
than other dyd ſay / wolde to god it were
ſo / for thanne ſuche as ſhulde be lodged here
ſhulde lye honorably / for dayly they ſhulde be
redy to do dedes of armes. They that were
within the towne doubted greatly the mater / 
wherfore they tooke great payne to defende
them ſelfes. The great heate and brinnynge
of the ſonne dyd put the cryſten men to great
payne and traueyle / for whan they were in
harneſſe by reaſon of the heate / it brente them
within their armure. Marueyle it was that
any ſkaped the dethe / by reaſon of the heate / 
for about the myddes of Auguſt the ayre was
ſore corrupted. Beſyde that there fell another
marueylous incydente / whiche if it had longe
endured / they had ben all deed without ſtroke
So it was that by reaſon of the great heate
and corrupcyon of the ayre / there fell amonge
them ſuche a ſorte of great flyes / that they couered
all the hooſt / for no man wyſte howe to
defende hym ſelfe / and euery daye a weke togyder
they encreaſed / wherof euery man was
abaſſhed / howe be it by the grace of god and
the vyrgyn Mary / to whome euery man auowed
them ſelfe / on a day dyd ſende a remedy.
There fell ſuche an hayle and lyghtenyng
fro heuen that it ſlewe all the ſayde flyes / And
by reaſon of this hayle / the ayre was brought
in to a good temperateneſſe / wherby ye knyghtes
and ſquyers were in a better aſtate than

they were before.
            WHo ſo euer had been in the caſe that
theſe cryſten men were in at yt tyme / 
it muſt haue behoued them to take euery
thynge in gree / they coulde nat haue had
euery thynge with wyſſhynge / nor at their demaunde.
Whan any fell ſicke it behoued them
to be well kepte / or els they ſhulde haue dyed / 
but they were come thyder with ſo good wylles
and affection / that they purpoſed honourably
to accomplyſſhe their voyage / whiche
mynde greatly ſupported thē to endure payne
and traueyle. All thynges that was mete for
their complexions they wanted / for nothynge
came to them out of the realme of Fraunce / tydynges
nor other. nor in Fraunce they knewe
no more of them. ſomtyme there came to the
army fro the cytie of Barcelone in the realme
of Aragon in a galey prouyſion / wherin was
mo orenges and pomegarnettes than any other
thynge. Theſe frutes yet refreſſhed greatly
the appetytes of the cryſten men / but whan
ſo euer any galey came to them / it retourned
nat agayne / what for doute of the encoūtryng
of the ſarazyns on the ſee / as for to abyde there
to ſe the concluſyon of the ſiege. The yonge
kynge of Cicyll often tymes ſente to the hooſt
vytaylles / for he was the nerte cryſten prince
adioynynge. If the ſarazyns had ben of that
ſtrength to haue ſtopped the paſſage of the ſee
fro them / and to haue kepte fro them ſuche vytayls
and prouyſions as came to the armye / 
fro Pule / Calabre / Naples / and Cicyll / the
cryſten men had ben deed without any ſtroke
ſtryking / but they made no warre but by lande / 
nor alſo they be nat of ſuche puyſſaunce on
the ſee / nother in gales nor in other veſſels / 
as the genouoys and venyſians be. For if the
ſarazyns be on the ſee it is but by ſtelthe / for
they dare nat abyde the cryſten men / without
they haue farre the aduaūtage. A galey with
cryſten men well armed / wyll diſcomfyte four
galees of ſarazyns. Trewe it is the turkes are
of greater force and better men of armes / outher
by lande or by ſee / than any other ſecte of
the myſcreantes contrary to our beleue / but
they dwell farre of fro the lande of Aufryke / 
the affrikans can nat be ayded by thē. The turkes
had certayne knowledge howe the towne
of Aufryke was beſyeged by the cryſten men / 
they wyſſhed them often tymes there.
            
               THe cryſten men ſtudyed howe to do
domage to the ſarazyns / and in lyke
wyſe ſo dyd the ſarazyns agaynſt the
chryſten men / ſtudyed howe to delyuer their
coūtrey of them. and on a day Agadingor Doliferne / 
Madefer de Thunes / Belyns Madages / 
and Brahadyn of Bougy with dyuers
other ſarazyns / deuyſed amonge them ſelfes
and ſayd. Beholde here the cryſten men our enemyes / 
who lye here before our faces in our
owne countrey / and yet we can nat diſcomfyte
them / and they are but a handefull of men / as
to the regarde of vs / howe be it we thinke veryly
they haue ſome great confort of ſome valyaunt
men out of their owne countreys / for at
no maner of ſkrymyſſh that we can make / and
for all that euer we can do / we can take neuer a
priſoner / for if we myght take one or two of
their valyaūt men / it ſhulde be greatly to our
honour / and by them to knowe their demeanour
and puyſſaunce / and what they purpoſe
to do. Syrs ꝙ Agadingor / let ſe what counſayle
is beſt in this caſe / as for me I am one of
the yongeſt / yet I ſpeke fyrſt. we are contente
therwith quod all the other / ſay what ye wyll.
Syrs quod he I deſyre greatly to do ſome
dede of armes with ſome cryſten man / and I
thynke veryly if I were matched with one to
dyſcomfyte hym in playne batayle. And ſyrs / 
if ye wyll do ſo that we myght fynde a .xx. or
.xxx. valyaunt men a monge vs / I ſhall cauſe
and I canne the cryſten men to ſette forthe as
many: our quarell is good / for they haue no
cauſe of reaſon to make warre againſt vs. and
I thynke what by reaſon of our iuſte quarell
and the good corage that we be of ſhall gyue
vs victory. Than Madyfer of Thunes aunſwered
and ſayd. Syr in your wordes is nothyng
but honour / to morowe if ye wyll ryde
and be in the former fronte of the batayle with
a trucheman with you / and make ſome token
that ye wolde ſpeke with ſome cryſten man / 
and than do you ſo moche as to offre the batayle
of .x. of yours agaynſt ten of theirs / than
ſhall ye here and ſe what they wyll aunſwere / 
and yet howe ſo euer they anſwere we may be
aduyſed what we wyll do / at leſte the cryſten
men ſhall repute vs the more valyaunt. They
all agreed to that apoyntmente / and ſo paſſed
that nyght. the next mornyng they rode forth
to ſkrymyſſhe with their enemyes / and Agadingor
formeſt / mounted on his good horſe / 

and his trucheman with him. The daye was
clere and bright / and a lytell before the ſonne
ryſynge / the ſarazyns ſet them ſelfe in ordre of
batayle. The ſame nyght ſir Willyam of Tremoyle
had kept the watch on ye cryſten parte / 
and with hym ſir Guy his brother. Than the
ſarazins apered before the criſten men within
a thre croſbowe ſhot / and Agadingor had his
truchman by him / he rode on before all his cō
               pany / 
and made token to ſpeke with ſome cryſten
man / on the one wynge of the felde. And a
gentle ſquyer called Affrenall / ſeyng the ſarazyn
and the ſygnes that he made / rode fro his
company & ſayd. Syrs ſtande ſtyll here / and
I wyll go and ſpeke with yōder ſarazyn / and
torne agayne to you / he hath a truchman with
hym / he cometh to ſpeke with ſome man. this
ſquier came to ye ſarazyn / who taryed for him.
Than the truchman ſaid / ye cryſten man. are
a noble man and a man of armes / and redy to
gyue aunſwere to our demaunde? I am ſuche
a one quod Affrenall / ſay what it pleace you / 
ye ſhalbe harde and receyued. Than quod the
trucheman / ſyr beholde here a gentleman and
a noble man of ours / who demaundeth the batayle
to fyght with you hande to hande / and if
ye wyll haue mo / we ſhall fynde to the nombre
of ſixe of ours redy to fight with .vi. of yours / 
and the quarell of our men ſhalbe this. They
ſay and wyll iuſtifye that our faythe is better
and more of valure than yours / for our faythe
and lawe hath ben written ſyth the begynning
of the worlde / and as for your lawe was foūde
out by one man / whome the iewes hanged on
a croſſe. Ahſyr quod Affrenall / ſpeke no further
of that mater / it appertaygneth nat to the
to ſpeke or diſpute our fayth and lawe. but ſay
to this ſarazyn / that he ſwere by his fayth and
beleue to afferme the batayle / & let hym bringe
to the nombre of .x. all gentlemen of name and
armes / and within this thre houres I ſhall
bringe as many to try the mater. The truthman
reſyted thoſe wordes to the ſarazyn / who
be ſemyng had gret ioy to accept and afferme
the batayle. Thus they toke this enterpriſe bytwene
them twayne and departed / and returned
to their owne companyes. tydinges herof
came to ſir Guy of Tremoyle and to ſyr Willyam
his brother / and whan they met with Affrenall
they demaunded fro whence he came / 
and what he had done with the ſarazyn. Than
Affrenall ſhewed hym all the hole mater / and
how that he had taken the batayle / wherof the
ſayd two knightes were ioyfull and ſayd. Affrenall
ſpeke to other / for we two ſhall be of the
nombre of the ten. ſyr quod Affrenall / as god
wyll ſo be it / I truſt I ſhall fynde ynowe that
wolde be glad to fyght with the ſarazyns. Anone
after Affrenall mette with the lorde of
Thune / and ſhewed hym the aduenture / and
demaūded if he wolde be one of the company.
The lord of Thune wolde nat refuſe but gladlye
graunted to be one of their company. For
euery one that Affrenall dyd gette / he myght
haue goten a .C. if he had wolde. Sir Boucyquant
the yonger / ſyr Helyons of Lingnac / 
ſyr Iohan Ruſſell englyſſhe / ſir Iohan Harpedon / 
Aleys Bodet / and Bochet / all theſe accepted
the batayle. Whan the nombre of ten
were accompliſſhed euery man drewe to their
lodgynge to arme them incontynent to do batayle.
Whan this was knowen in ye hooſt / and
the knyghtes named that had taken on them
that enterpriſe. Than all other knyghtes and
ſquyers ſayd. a theſe ten knightes were borne
in a good houre / that haue founde this day ſo
happy an aduenture. wolde to god quod dyuers
that we were of yt nombre. Euery knight
and ſquyer was ioyfull of this enterpriſe / and
greatly prayſed the aduenture / ſauynge the
gentle lorde of Coucy / who was nat cotente
therwith.
            THe lorde of Thune was of the company
of the lorde of coucy / he ſhewed him
the couenante he had made with Affrenall / to
be one of the ten to fight with ten ſarazyns. as
many as herde therof prayſed greatly that aduenture / 
but the lorde of Coucy ſpake againſt
it and ſayd. Ah ſirs ye yonge people yt knowe
but lytell of the worlde / but rather exalte a folyſſhe
ded than a wyſe dede. In this enterpriſe
I can ſe no reaſon for dyuers cauſes. one
is that ten knyghtes and ſquyers of our men / 
all gentlemen of name and blode / muſt fyght
agaynſte as many ſarazyns. Howe ſhall our
men knowe whether they be gentlemen or no?
if they lyſt they may ſet agaynſt our men ten
rybauldes or varlettes / and if they hap to be
dyſcomfyted / we ſhall wyn nothynge but ten
varlettes / and yet we ſhall be neuer the nerer
to wyn ye towne of Aufryke / but we ſhall thus
put our good men in aduēture. peraduenture
they wyll ſet a buſſhment / and whan our ten

men be in the felde to tary for their men / they
wyll cloſe them roūde about / wherby we ſhall
leſe them and be ſomoche the febler. There I
ſay quod the lorde of Coucy yt Affrenall hath
nat wrought wyſely in this mater / for at the
firſt whan the ſarazyn dyd defye him he ſhuld
than haue made a nother maner of aunſwere
than he dyd. he ſhuld haue ſayd howe he was
nat the chefe heed of that army / but rather one
of the pooreſt / & where as ye blame our faythe
and byleue / ye are nat mete to haue an anſwer
made to you therof by me / but if ye lyſt I ſhall
brynge you to the great lordes of our armye / 
and I ſhall take you vnder my ſaueconducte / 
that ye ſhall go and returne in ſauegarde and
ſuretie / and the
                  •
                ye ſhall here the lordes ſpeke.
Thus Affrenall ſhuld haue ledde the ſarazyn
to the duke of Burbone and to the counſayle / 
and there he ſhulde haue been herde at leyſer / 
and anſwered by good aduyſe / ſuche defyaūce
in armes for ſuche quarell ought nat to paſſe
without great deliberacion of good coūſayle.
And than if the batayle had ben agreed vnto
by vs / yet it wolde haue ben knowen of them
what men by name and ſurname ſhulde acomplyſſh
the batayle. Thervpon we to haue choſen
other of our men for our honour and profite / 
and thervpon to hane had of the ſarazyns
ſuretie and hoſtage / and they of vs. This had
ben a more metely maner to haue vſed / wherfore
if this treatie might be withdrawen with
reaſon / it ſhulde be well doone / and I wyll go
and ſpeke with the duke of Burbone / and to
take counſayle with the lordes of the armye / 
and to knowe what they wyll ſay therto. thus
the lorde of Coucy departed fro the lorde of
Thune / and wente to the Duke of Burbons
tent / where all the barons aſſembled togyder
to take coūſayle in that mater. For all that the
lorde of Coucy had ſayde theſe wordes to the
lorde of Thune / by maner of good counſayle
and aduyſe / yet for all that he lefte nat / but armed
hymſelfe / and ſo came forth with other of
his company redy to fight with the ſarazyns / 
and ſir Guy of Tremoyle the formeſt knight.
Thus the lordes of Fraunce were in coūſayle
in the duke of Burbons tent. Some thought
this defiaunce to be reaſonable / and ſuſteyned
greatly the wordes and opinyon of the lorde
Coucy / ſayeng howe it were better to make a
nother maner of treatie. And ſome other / as
ſpecyall the lorde Loys erle of Arthoys / and
ſir Philyp of Bare ſayd. Syth the armes be
taken and accepted on our parte / it ſhulde be
great blame to let it / wherfore in the name of
god and our lady let our knyghtes and ſquyers
furnyſſhe their enterpriſe. This purpoſe
was holden and ſuſteyned / but than all thynges
conſydred / it was thought for the beſt that
all the hole hoſt ſhulde be armed / and be in ordre
of batayle / to thentent that if the ſarazyns
wolde do any falſneſſe they ſhulde be redy to
reſyſt them. This was accomplyſſhed and euery
man well armed / and drewe in to ye felde
in good ordre of batayle redy to fyght / the genouoys
croſebowes on the one ſyde / and the
knyghtes and ſquiers on the other ſyde / euery
lord vnder his baner or penon of their armes / 
it was a goodly ſyght to beholde them. The
cryſten men ſhewed well howe they had great
deſyre that the ſarazyns ſhuld haue come and
fought with them. And the ten cryſten knightes
and ſquiers were redy in the felde aloue of
fro their company / abydynge for the ten ſarazins
that ſhulde haue fought with them / but it
ſemed well they had no wyll therto / for whan
they ſawe howe the cryſten men ordred them
ſelfe & were redy in batayle / they douted them
and durſt nat come forwarde / for all that they
were thre tymes as many men as the cryſten
men were. The ſaraſyns wolde often tymes
come well mounted / and ſkrymyſſh before the
cryſten mennes batayle / and than returne againe.
and this they dyd of pure malice to put
the cryſten men to payne and traueyle. This
day was ſo hote with the ſonne / that before nor
after there had been no ſuche ſene / ſo that they
that were moſte luſty and freſſhe were ſo ſore
chafed in their harneſſe that they were nere ouercome
for faute of ayre and wynde. And always
the .x. cryſten men taryed a parte for the
ten ſarazyns / but they nother ſawe nor herde
tydynges of any. Than they aduyſed to aproche
the towne of Aufryke and to aſſayle it / ſeynge
they were all redy armed and redy in batayle.
And all day to kepe their honour the ten
knightes kept the felde tyll it was night. there
went to the aſſaute knyghtes and ſquyers / deſyringe
to do dedes of armes / they were hote
and ſore chafed / and yet they traueyled them
ſelfe more and more. And if the ſaraſyns had
well knowen what caſe ye cryſten men were in / 
they might haue done thē great domage / and
a reyſed the ſiege / and by lykelyhode to haue

had the victory / for ye cryſten men were ſo wery
and ſo ſore traueyled that they had but lytell
ſtrenght / howe be it they conquered by aſſaute
the firſt wall of the towne where no man
dwelte. Than the ſarazyns retrayed in to the
ſeconde fortreſſe / ſkrymyſſhynge without takynge
of any great domage / but the cryſten
men had domage ynough / for in ſkrimiſſhyng
and aſſautynge they were in the heate of the
ſonne and in the duſte of the ſandes tyll it was
myght / wherby dyuers knyghtes and ſquiers
toke their dethe / whiche was great pytie and
domage. By the ſaid occaſion there dyed / firſt

There dyed mo than a .lx. knightes and ſquyers / 
whiche wyſely to conſyder was a great
loſſe. And if ye lorde of Coucy had ben beleued
this had nat fortuned / for and they had kepte
their lodgynges as they dyd before / they had
receyued no ſuche domage.
         
         
            ¶How after this aduenture and domage
that fell to the cryſten men by
reaſon of this aſſaute before the towne
of Aufryke & that ſo many knightes
& ſquyers were deed / they mayntayned
them ſelfe more wyſely after

Cap. C.lxxii.
            
               OF this foreſaid aduenture
the knightes and ſquiers of the
hoſt / were ſore diſpleaſed and abaſſhed:
euery man bewayled
his frēdes: at nyght they drewe
to their lodginges and made gretter watche
than they had made before / for dout of the ſarazyns:
they paſſed that nyght without any
other dōmage. Of this aduenture the ſarazins
knewe nothyng / for if they had knowen
what caſe the Chriſten men had been in / they
might haue done them great dōmage: but alwayes
they feared the Chriſten men: They
durſt neuer aduēture to auaūce thē ſelfe / but
by ſcrimyſſhing & caſtynge of their dartes.
They that were mooſt renomed in armes of
their partie was Agadyngore of Olyferne / 
for he loued the doughter of ye kyng of Thunes / 
wherby he was mooſt freſſheſt and ioly
in dedes of armes. Thus contynued ye ſiege
before the towne of Aufryke. In the realme
of Fraunce & Englande / and in ſuche countreys
as theſe knightes came fro / they herde
no maner of tidynges of them / wherof their
frendes were ſore abaſſhed / & wyſt nat what
to ſaye nor thynke. In dyuers places / bothe
in Englande / Heynalte / and in Fraūce there
were proceſſyōs made / to pray to god for the
ꝓſperite of theſe chriſten men. Thentencion
of the chriſten men beyng at the ſiege / was to
abyde there tyll they had cōquered the town
of Affrike / outher by force / famyne / or treatie
The kyng of Cicyll wolde gladly it had ben
ſo / & ſo wolde all other xp̄en yles adioynyng
for this towne of Affrike was their vtter enemye:
and ſpecially the genouoys toke great
payne to ſerue the lordes to their pleaſure / to
thētent they ſhulde nat be anoyed by reaſon
of their long ſiege. To ſpeke proꝑly / it was
a marueylous enterprice / & came of an highe
corage of the chriſten knightes and ſquyers / 
and ſpecially the Frenchmen / who for all the
loſſe of their knightes and ſquiers / & pouertie
that they endured / yet they cōtynued ſtyll
the ſiege at their great coſtes & chargꝭ without
ayde or cōforte. And the genouoys / who
were ye firſt ſetters on that enterprice / began
than to faynt and diſſymule / for as the bruteran
than / they wolde haue ben gladde to haue
made a treatie with the Sarazyns / and
to haue lefte the knyghtes of Fraunce and
Englande / and of other Chriſten countreys

ſtyll in that buſyneſſe. as I ſhall ſhewe you
here after / as it was enformed me. ¶ Nowe
at this preſent tyme lette vs leaue to ſpeke of
this ſiege of Aufryke / and ſpeke of a feſt that
the kynge of Englande made the ſame ſeaſon
in London.

feſt was thus ordayned and deuiſed / and herauldes
were charged to crye and publyſſhe
this feeſt in Englande / in Scotlande / in Almayne / 
in Flaūders / in Brabant / in Heynalt
and in Fraunce / the heraldes departed ſome
hider and ſome thider. Theſe tidyngꝭ ſprede
abrode into dyuers coūtreys. The heraudes
had daye and tyme ſuffycient. Knightes and
ſquiers in dyuers coūtreys apparelled them
ſelfes to be at this feeſt / ſome to ſe the maner
of Englande and ſome to iuſte. Whan theſe
tidynges came in to Heynalt ſir Wyllyam of
Heynault erle of Oſtrenaunt who was yonge
and lyberall / and deſyrous to iuſte. Purpoſed
in hym ſelfe to go to the feeſt in Englā
               de / 
to ſe and to honour his coſyns / kyng Rycharde
of Englande and his vncles / whome
he had neuer ſene before. He hadde great deſyre
to be aquaynted with them / and deſyred
other knightes and ſquyers to kepe hym cō
               pany / 
and ſpecially the lorde of Gomegynes
bycauſe he was well acquaynted with Englyſſhe
men / for he had ben dyuers tymes amonge

purpoſed whyle he made his prouiſyon
to go in to Hollande to ſe his father Auberte / 
erle of Heynaulte / Hollande / and zelande / 
to the entente to ſpeke with hym / and
to take leaue to go in to Englande. He deꝓted
fro Queſnoy in Haynault / and rode tyll
he came to Haye in Hollande / where the erle
his father was at that tyme. and there he ſhewed
his father his purpoſe that he was in to
go in to Englande to ſe the countrey & his coſyns / 
whom he had neuer ſene. Than therle
his father anſwered and ſayd. Wyllyam my
fayre ſon / ye haue nothyng to do in Englāde
for nowe ye be by couenaunt of maryage alyed
to the realme of Fraunce / and your ſuſter
to be maryed to the duke of Burgoyne / 
wherfore ye nede nat to ſeke none other alyaunce.
Dere father quod he / I wyll nat go

in to Englande to make any alyaūce. I do it
but to feeſt and make myrthe with my coſins
there / whom as yet I neuer ſawe, & bycauſe
the feeſt whiche ſhalbe holden at London / is
publiſſhed abrode. wherfore ſyth I am ſignifyed
therof & ſhulde nat go thyder / it ſhulde
be ſayd I were proude & preſuptuous / wher
fore in the ſauynge of myne honoure I wyll
go thider / therfore dere father I requyre you
agree therto. Sonne quod he do as ye lyſte / 
but I thynke ſurely it were better that ye taryed
at home. Whan the erle of Oſtrenaunt
ſawe that his wordes contented nat his father / 
he wolde ſpeke no more therof / but fell
in other cōmunicacion. But he thought well
ynough what he wolde do / and ſo dayly ſent
his prouiſyon towardes Calais. Gomegynes
the heraulde was ſente in to Englande
fro therle of Oſtrenaunt / to gyue knowlege
to kynge Rycharde and to his vncles / howe
that he wolde come honorably to his feeſt at
London. Of thoſe tidynges the kynge and
his vncles were ryght ioyouſe / and gaue to
the heraulde great giftes / whiche after ſtode
hym in great ſtede. For after in the ende of
his dayes he fell blynde / I can nat tell if god
were diſpleaſed with hym or nat / in his dayes
he lyued marueylouſly / wherfore in his
olde dayes and that he hadde loſte his ſyght
there were but fewe that were ſorte therof.
Thus the erle of Oſtrenaunt departed from
Haye in Hollande / and toke leaue of his father / 
and ſo retourned to Queſnoy in Heynaulte
to the coūteſſe his wyfe.
            THis noble feeſt wherof I make mē

to go in to Englande / and ſo came to Calys.
And alſo the erle Oſtrenaunt departed fro
Heynaulte / well accompanyed with knyghtes
and ſquyers / and ſo paſſed throughe the
countrey of Arthoys / and came alſo to Calis
and there he founde the erle of ſaynt Poule / 
and the ſhyppes paſſagers of Douer were

I thynke it true / that therle of ſaynt Poule
paſſed firſt in to Englande before the erle of

he founde there the kyng / and his brother in

hym with great ioye / and demaūded of hym
tidynges of the realme of Fraunce. He aunſwered
well & wyſely. Than therle of Oſtrenaunt
paſſed ouer on a thurſdaye and ſo cāe
to Cauterbury / and on the friday he viſyted
ſaint Thomas ſhrine and offred there in the
mornyng / and laye there all that daye / & the
nexte day rode to Rocheſter. And bycauſe he
had ſo gret a company and cariages he rode
but ſmall iourneys / to eaſe his horſe. And on
the ſondaye he rode to dyner to Dertforde / &
after dyuer to London to be at the feeſt / whiche
began the ſame ſonday.
            ON the ſonday nexte after the feeſt of
ſaynt Michaell / this feeſt and tryū
               phe
ſhulde begyn / and that daye to
be done in Smythfelde / iuſtes called the chalenge.
So the ſame ſonday about thre of the
clocke at after noone / there iſſued out of the
towre of London. firſt threſcore courſers apparelled
for the Iuſtes / and on euery one a
ſquier of honour ridyng a ſofte paſe. Than
iſſued out threſcore ladyes of honour mounted
on fayre palfreys / ridyng on the one ſyde
richely apparelled: and euery lady ledde a
knight with a cheyne of ſyluer / which knightes
were apparelled to iuſt. Thus they cam
ridynge a longe the ſtretes of London with
great nombre of trumpettes and other mynſtrelles.
And ſo came to Smythfelde / where
the quene of Englande and other ladies and
damoſelles were redy in chābres richely adorned
to ſe the iuſtes / and the king was with
the quene. And whan ye ladyes that ledde the
knyghtes were come to the place / they were
taken downe fro their palfreys / & they moū
               ted
vp in to chambres redy aparelled for thē.
Than the ſquiers of honour alighted fro the
courſers / & the knightes in good order moū
               ted
on them. than their helmes were ſette on
and made redy at all poyntes. Than thyder
came the erle of ſaynt Poule / nobly accompanyed
with knyghtes and ſquyers all armed
with harneſſe / for the iuſtes to begynne
the feeſt / whiche incontynent beganne: and

there iuſted all knyghtes ſtraungers / ſuche
as wolde and hadde leyſar and ſpace / for the
nyght came on. Thus theſe iuſtes of chaleng
began / and cōtynued tyll it was night.
Than knyghtes and ladyes withdrue them
ſelfes: & the quene was lodged beſyde Poules
in the byſſhoppes palace / and there was
the ſupper prepared. The ſame euennynge
came therle of Oſtrenaunt to the kyng / who
was nobly receyued. ¶ Nowe for theſe iuſtes
on the ſonday. For the aunſwerer without / 
The erle Walleran of ſaynt Poule had
the price. And of the chalengers the erle of
Huntyngdon. There was goodly daūſyng
in the quenes lodgyng / in the preſence of the
kynge and his vncles / and other barons of
Englande: and ladyes and damoſelles contynuyng
tyll it was daye / whiche was tyme
for euery perſone to drawe to their lodgynges / 
except the kyng and the quene / who lay
there in the Byſſhoppes Palays / for there
they laye all the feeſtes and iuſtes duryng.
            ON the nexte day whiche was mondaye / 
ye myght haue ſene in dyuers
places of the cytie of London / ſquyers
and varlettes goynge aboute with harneſſe / 
and doynge of other buſyneſſe of their
maiſters. After noon kynge Richarde came
to the place all armed richely apparelled / accompanyed
with Dukes / erles / lordes / and
knyghtes. He was one of the inner partie.
Than the quene well accompanyed with ladyes
and damoſels came to the place where
the iuſtes ſhulde be / and mounted in to chā
               bres
and ſcaffoldes ordayned for thē. Than
came in to the felde the erle of Oſtrenaunte / 
well accōpanyed with knyghtes of his coū
               trey / 
and all were redy to iuſte. Than came
the erle of ſaynt Poule and other knyghtes
of Fraunce / ſuche as wolde iuſte. Than began
the iuſtes / euery man payned hym ſelfe
to gette honour. Some were ſtryken down
fro their horſes. Theſe iuſtes contynued tyll
it was nere nyght. Than euery ꝑſon drewe
to their lodgynges knyghtes and ladyes / &
at ye hour of ſupper / euery man drewe to the
courte. There was a goodly ſupper & well
ordayned. And as that day the price was gyuen
to the erle of Oſtrenaunt / for the beſt iuſter
of the vtter partie / and well he deſerued
it. The price was gyuen hym by the ladyes
lordes and herauldes / who were ordained to
be iudges. And of the inner partie a knyght
of Englande called ſir Hughe Spenſer / had
the price.
            THe nexte daye Tueſday / there was
iuſtes agayne in the ſame place of
all maner of ſquyers / whiche endured
tyll it was nyght / in the preſence of the
kyng / quene / lordes / and ladyes. Than euery
man drewe to their lodgyngꝭ / as they had
done the dayes before / and at ſupper they retourned
to the byſſhoppes palais / where the
kyng / the quene / and the ladyes were. There
was a goodly and a coſtely ſupper / and after
great daunſynge / contynuynge all nyght.
            The wedniſdaye after dyner they iuſted in
the ſame place / all maner of knightes & ſquyers
ſuche as wolde iuſte. that was a ſore and
a rude iuſtes / enduryng tyll nyght / and than
wtdrue: & at the hour of ſupper they reſorted
where they ſupped before. The Thurſdaye
the kyng made a ſupper to all knyghtes and
gentylmen ſtraungers / and the quene to all
ladyes and damoſelles. Than on the friday
the duke of Lancaſtre made a dyner for all
knightes & ſquyers ſtraungers / whiche was
a goodly dyner. And on the Saturdaye the
kyng and all the lordes departed fro Lōdon
to Wyndſore / and therle of Oſtrenaunt and
the erle of ſaynt Poule / with all other knightes
and ſquyers ſtraungers were deſyred to
acompany the kyng to Wyndſore / euery mā
rode as it was reaſon to the caſtell of Wyndſore.
Than there began agayne great feeſtꝭ / 
with dyners and ſuppers gyuen by the king
and ſpecially the kyng dyde great honour to
the erle of Oſtrenaunt his coſyn / whiche erle
was deſyred by the kyng and his vncles that
he wolde be content to take on hym the order
of the garter. The erle aunſwered / howe he
wolde take coūſayle in that mater. Than he
coūſayled with the lorde of Gomegines and
with Fierabras of Vertan baſtarde / who in
no wyſe wolde diſcorage nor counſayle hym
to refuce the order of the garter. So he toke
it on hym / wherof the knightes and ſquyers
of Fraūce ſuche as were there had great marueyle / 
and murmured ſore therat among thē
ſelfe: ſayeng the erle of Oſtrenaunt ſheweth
well that his courage enclyneth rather to be
Englyſſhe than Frenche / whan he taketh on

hym the order of the garter / and weareth the
kynge of Englandes deuyſe. He ſheweth
well he regardeth nat the houſe of Fraunce / 
nor the houſe of Burgoyne. The tyme wyll
come he ſhall repent hym ſelfe. All thynges
cōſydred / he knoweth nat what he hath done
for he was welbeloued with the frenche kynge / 
and with the duke of Thourayne his brother / 
and with all the blode royall / in ſuche
wyſe / that whan he came to Parys or in to any
other place to any of them / they euer made
hym more honour than any other of their
coſyns. Thus theſe Frenche men euyll accuſed
hym without cauſe / for that he had done / 
was nothyng contrary nor hurtfull to the realme
of Fraunce / nor to his coſyns nor frendes
in Fraunce. For he thought none otherwyſe
but honour and loue / and to pleace his
coſyns in Englande / and to be therby the rather
a good meane bytwene Fraūce and Englande / 
if nede were. Nor the daye that he
toke on hym the order of the garter / and his
othe / euery man maye well vnderſtande that
he made none alyaunce / to do any preiudyce
to the realme of Fraunce. For that he dyde / 
was but for loue and good company / howe
be it / no man canne let the enuyous to ſpeke
yuell.
            
               WHan they had daūced and ſported
them a certayne 
                  •
               pace in the
caſtell of Wynſore / and that the
kyng hadde gyuen many fayre
gyttes to ye knightes and ſquy
               
                  •••
               
of honour / of the realme of Fraunce and
Heynaulte / and ſpecially to the yonge erle of
Oſtrenaunt. Than euery man toke leaue of
the kynge and of the quene / and of other ladyes
and damoſelles / and of the kynges vncles.
Than̄e the erle of ſaynt Poule and the
Frenche men / and the Henowayes and almaygnes
departed. Thus ended this great
feeſt in the cytie of London / and euery man
went to their owne. Than it fortuned / as a
none brute ronneth farre of. The Frenche
kynge / his brother / and his vncles / were enfourmed
by ſuche as hadde ben in Englande
at the ſayde feeſt / of euery thyng that hadde
been done and ſayd / nothyuge was forgotten / 
but rather more putte to / in the exaltyng
of yuell dedes / than fortheryng of good dedes.
It was ſhewed the kyng playnly / how
the erle of Oſtrenaunt had ben in Englande
and taken great payne to exalte and to do honoure
to the Englyſſhe men / and in helpynge
forwarde the feeſt holden at London. and
howe he hadde the chiefe priſe and honoure
of the iuſtes aboue all other ſtraungers. and
howe he had ſpoken ſo fayre to the Englyſh
men / that he was become the kynge or Englandes
man / and had made ſcruyce and alyaunce
with hym. And taken on hym the order
of the Garter / in the chapell of ſaynt George
in Wyndſore / whiche order was fyrſte
ſtablyſshed by kynge Edwarde the thirde / 
and his ſonne prince of Wales. And howe
that no man myght entre in to that confrary
or company / without he make ſeruyaunt or
othe / neuer to beare armoure agaynſte the
crowne of Englande. Whiche promyſe they
ſayd / the erle of Oſtrenaunt had made with
oute any reſeruacyon. with theſe tidynges / 
the Frenche kynge / his brother / and his vncles
were ſore troubled / and greuouſly diſpleaſed
with the erle of Oſtrenaunt. Than
the Frenche kyng ſayde. Lo ſirs / ye maye
                  •
               e
what it is to do for hym. It is nat yet a yere
paſte / ſythe he deſyred me that his brother
myght be byſſhoppe of Cambrey. And by
theſe tidynges that gyfte were rather preiudyciall
to the realme of Fraunce / than auaū
               cement.
It hadde been better we had gyuen
it to our coſyn of ſaynt Poule. The Heynoways
dyd neuer good to vs / nor neuer wyll:
for they be proude / preſumptuous / and to fierſe.
Alwayes they haue owed better good
wyll to the Englyſſhe men than to vs / but a
daye ſhall come they ſhall repent them. We
wyll ſende to the erle of Oſtrenaunt / cōmaū
               dynge
hym to come to vs / to do vs homage
for the coūtie of Oſtrenaunt / or els we ſhall
put hym fro it / and annexe it to oure realme.
They of his counſayle anſwered and ſayde.
Sir / ye haue well deuyſed / lette it be done
as ye haue ſayde. It maye well be thought
that the duke of Burgoyne / whoſe doughter
the erle of Oſtrenaunt had to his wyfe / was
nothynge content with thoſe tidynges / for alwayes
he had auaunſed his ſonne of Oſtrenaunt / 
towardes the kyng and his coūſaile.
This mater was nat forgotten / but incontinent
the Frenche kyng wrote ſharpe letters
to therle of Oſtrenaūt / who was at queſnoy

in Heynaulte / cōmaundyng hym to come to
Parys to do his homage / before the kynge
and the other peeres of Fraunce / for the coutie
of Oſtrenaut / or els the kyng wolde take
it fro hym / and make hym warre. Whan the
erle had well ouerſene theſe letters / and parceyued
howe that the Frenche kyng and his
counſayle were diſpleaſed with hym / to make
his anſwere he aſſembled his counſayle.
as the lorde of Fountayns / the lorde of Gomegynes / 
ſir Wyllyam of Hermes / the lorde
of Traſſegnies / the bayly of Heynaulte / the
lorde of Sancelles / ſir Raſe of Montigny / 
the abbot of Criſpyne / Iohan Sulbart / Iaquemart
Barrier of Valencennes. Theſe
wyſemen counſayled togider / what anſwere
might be made to the kynges letters. There
were many reaſons alleged / at laſt all thynges
conſydred / they thought it for the beſt to
write to the Frenche kynge and to his counſayle / 
to take a daye to anſwere clerely to all
maner of demaundes / by the mouthe of certayne
credyble ꝑſons / and none by writyng.
And in the meane ſeaſon they ſente certayne
notable perſonages to the erle of Heynaulte
and duke Aubert of Holāde to haue their coū
               ſayles
what anſwere to make. Thus they
dyde. They wrote ſwetely and courteſly to
the kynge and to his counſayle / ſo that with
thoſe fyrſt letters the kyng and his coūſayle
was well content. Than therle and his coū
               ſayle
ſent in to Hollande the lorde of Traſſegines
and the lorde of Sancelles / Iohan
Semart and Iaques Barrier. They rode
to the erle of Heynault / and ſhewed hym the
ſtate of the countie or Heynault / and the letters
that the Frenche kyng hadde ſent to his
ſonne the erle of Oſtrenaunt. the erle of Heynaulte
had marueyle of that mater and ſaid.
Sirs / I thought neuer otherwyſe / but that
it ſhulde come thus to paſſe. Wyllyam my
ſon̄e had nothyng to do to go in to Englāde.
I haue delyuered hym the rule and gouernaunce
of the coūtie of Heynaulte. he might
haue done & vſed hym ſelfe / accordyng to the
counſayle of the countrey. Sirs / I ſhall tell
you what ye ſhall do. Go to my fayre coſyn
the duke of Burgoyn / for it lyeth well in his
power to regarde and to ſette an order in all
thynges demaunded by the Frenche kynge / 
I canne gyue you no better counſayle. With
this anſwere they departed out of Hollande
and came in to Heynault / and there ſhewed
what anſwere they had / wherwith the erle &
his counſayle were content. There was aſſigned
to go in to Fraūce to the duke of Burgoyne / 
the lorde of Traſſegnies / ſir Wyllm̄
of Hermyes / ſir Raſe of Montigny / Iohan
Semart / and Iaques Barrier: To ſhewe
and declare all ye proceſſe and ſute that they
made at the Frenche courte / ſhulde be ouer
longe to reſyte. But finally all thynges concluded / 
for all yt the duke of Burgoyne coude
do / there was non other remedy / but that the
erle of Oſtrenaunt muſt come perſonally to
Parys / and to knowe his homage due to the
Frenche kyng for the countie of Oſtrenaunt
or els ſurely to haue warre. The lorde of coucy
& ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon toke great payne
for the erles ſake / but ſir Iohn̄ Mercier and
the lorde de la Ryuer labored on the contrarye
ſyde / as moche as they might. ¶ Nowe
let vs leaue to ſpeke any more of this mater / 
and retourne to ſpeke of the lordes & knyghtes
of Fraunce / who were at the ſiege before
the ſtrong towne of Aufryke agaynſt the ſarazyns.

            ¶Howe and by what incydent the
ſiege was reyſed before the towne of
Aufryke / and by what occaſyon and
howe euery man retourned to their
owne countreis. Cap. C.lxxiiii.
            
               YE haue herde here before / 
howe the chriſten men had beſieged
the ſtronge towne of Aufryke / 
by lande & by ſee: Settyng
all their ententes / howe to conquere
it / for they thought if they might wyn
it / the brute therof ſhulde ſounde / to their
great honours and prayſe. and howe they
myght there kepe them ſelfe toguyder / and
to reſyſt agaynſt their ennemyes: ſayenge
howe they ſhulde alwayes haue conforte of
the Chriſten men / and ſpecially of the Frenche
kyng / who was yong and deſyrous of dedes
of armes / conſydring howe he had truce
with the Englyſſhmen for two yeres to cōe.

the ſarazyns feared the ſame / wherfore dayly
they made prouyſyon for the towne / and refreſſhed
alwaies their towne with newe freſſh
men / hardy aduenturers / accordynge to their
vſage. Thus the ſeaſon paſſed on / and after
the chriſten men hadde ſuffred the great loſſe
of their companyons with lytell wynnynge
or aduauntage on their partye / all their hole
hooſt were in a maner dyſcomforted / for they
coulde nat ſe howe to be reuenged. Than many
of theym beganne to murmure / ſayenge
we lye here all in vayne / as for the ſkrymyſſhes
that we make / therby ſhall we neuer wyn
the Towne of Auffryke / for if we ſlee any of
them / for eche of them they wyll gette agayne
ten other. They be in their owne countrey / 
they haue vytayles and prouyſyons at their
pleaſure / and that we haue is with great daū
               ger
and parell. What ſhall we thynke to do? if
we lye here all this wynter / longe and colde
nyghtes / we ſhalbe morfounded and froſen to
dethe. Thus we ſhall be in a herde caſe by dyuers
wayes. firſt in wynter no man dare take
the ſee for the cruell and tyrryble wyndes and
tempeſtes of the ſee / for the ſees and tempeſtes
are more fierſer in wynter than in ſomer / and
if we ſhulde lacke vytayles but eight dayes togyther / 
and that the ſee wolde ſuffre none to
come to vs / we were all deed and loſt without
remedy. Secondly though it were ſo that we
had vytayles and all thynges neceſſary with
out daunger / yet howe coulde our watche endure
the payne and traueyle contynually to
watche euery night. the parell and aduenture
is ouer herde for vs to beare / for our enemyes
who be in their owne countrey / and knowe the
countrey / may come by nyght and aſſayle vs
to their great aduauntage / and do vs great
domage / as they haue done all redy. Thyrdly
if for faute of good ayre & of ſwete freſſhe meates / 
wherwith we haue been noryſſhed / that
mortalyte hap to fall in our hooſt / we ſhall dye
euery man fro other / for we haue no remedy to
reſyſt agaynſt it. Alſo furthermore if the genouoys
turne agaynſt vs / which are rude people
and traytours / they may be nyght tyme entre
in to their ſhyppes / & ſo leue vs here to pay for
the ſcotte. All theſe doutes are to be conſydred
by our capytaynes who lye at their eaſe / and
regarde nat the caſe we be in▪ and alſo ſome of
the genouoys ſpared nat to ſpeke / and ſayd in
raylynge to the cryſten men. What men of armes
be ye frenche men / whan we departed fro
Genne we thought that within fyftene dayes
that ye had layen at ſiege before the towne of
Aufryke / ye ſhulde haue conquered it / & nowe
we haue ben here more thanne two monthes / 
and as yet we haue done nothyng / as for ſuch
aſſautes & ſkrymyſſhes as ye make / the towne
nedeth nat to feare this yere / nor yet the nexte.
by this maner of meanes ye ſhall neuer conquere
this realme of Aufryke nor yet of Thunes.
This comunynge ſpred ſo abrode in the
hooſt / that it came to the knowlege of the gret
lordes and capytaynes of the armye / and ſpecyally
the lorde of Coucy / who was ſage and
diſcrete / and to whoſe coūſayle the chefe parte
of the hoſt inclyned euer vnto. He ſayd to him
ſelfe and conſidred howe all theſe doutes were
greatly to be feared / and to the entente to ordayn
haſtely remedy / he aſſembled ſecretly all
the great lordes of the hooſt togyder in counſayle / 
bycauſe wynter aproched. This counſayle
was kept in the duke of Burbons tente / 
and the concluſyon was to dyſlodge for that
ſeaſone / and euery man to retourne the ſame
way as they came / the lordes prepared ſecretly
for this. than the patrons of the galees were
ſente for / and their purpoſe was ſhewed vnto
them / and they wyſt nat what to ſay to the contrary / 
at laſte they ſayde. My lordes take no
doute nor ſuſpecte in vs / we haue made you
promeſſe / wherfore we wyll acquyte vs truely
to you / for if we wolde haue enclyned to the
treaties of the affrykans / they wolde gaue deſyred
to haue had peace with vs / bnt we wold
neuer gyue heryng to them. we wyll kepe our
faythe to you / ſyth we haue promyſed ſo to do.
Sirs quod the lorde of Coucy / we repute you
for good and trewe / and valyaſit men / but we
haue conſydred dyuers thynges / wynter aprocheth / 
and we are deſtytute of vitayles & other
prouyſions. By the grace of god we ones retourned
in to the realme of Fraunce / we ſhall
ſo enfourme the kynge / who is yonge and luſty
and deſyrous to knowe the maner of theſe
marches / and ſeynge that he hath treuce with
the englyſſhe men / we thynke ſmall counſaylynge
wyll cauſe hym to come hyther with a
puyſſaunce royall / as well to ayde the king of
Cicyll / as to make ſome conqueſt vpon the ſarazyns / 
wherfore ſyrs / we requyre you make
redy your galees and all other veſſels / for we
wyll departe within ſhorte dayes. The genouoys

were nothynge content with the frenche
men / in that they wolde departe fro the ſiege
before the ſtronge towne of Aufryke / but they
coulde fynde none other remedy / wherfore it
behoued them to ſuffre. A generall brute ran
through the hooſt / howe the genouoys were aboute
to bargayne with the ſarazyns / & take
their parte / and to betray ye cryſten men. The
cryſten men beleued this to be true / and ſome
ſaid one to an other. our ſouerayne capitayns
as the duke of Burbone / the erle Dolphyn of
Auuergne / and the lorde Coucy / ſyr Guy de la
Tremoyle / ſyr Iohan of Vyen / and ſyr Phylyppe
of Bare / they knowe ſurely howe euery
thynge gothe / and therfore we ſhall thus ſodaynely
departe fro the ſiege. Their departure
was publyſſhed throughe the hooſt / and
euery man cōmaunded to conuey euery thing
in to their ſhyppes. Than ſaruaūtes and varletres
were redy to truſſe all maner of baggages / 
and to cary it in to their veſſels lyenge at
ancre. Whan euery thyng was cōueyed / euery
man entred in to ſuche ſhyppes as they came
in / and dyuers barones and knyghtes made
couenaūt with their patrons and mayſters of
their ſhyppes / ſome to ſayle to Naples / ſome
to Cicyll / ſome to Cyper / and ſome to Rodes / 
to the entent to go to Iheruſalem. Thus they
departed fro the ſiege of Aufryke / and toke
the ſee in the ſyght of the ſarazyns that were
within the towne. Whan they ſawe their departure / 
they made gret noyſe with blowyng
of hornes and ſownynge of taburs / and ſhoutynge
and cryeng / in ſuche wyſe / that the hoſt
of ſarazyns that lay abrode knew therof. than
ye ſhuld haue ſene the yonge ſarazyns moūte
on their horſes / and came to the place where
the ſiege had layne / to ſe if they coulde haue
founde any thynge there. Agadingor of Olyferne / 
and Brahadyne of Thunes formeſt.
And there they ſawe howe the chriſten men
were ſo clene departed / that they had lefte nothynge
behynde that they myght cary. There
the ſarazyns rode vp and downe more than
two houres / to ſe the maner howe the cryſten
men had lodged theym ſelfe at the ſiege / they
greatly prayſed the cryſten mennes ſubtyltie / 
in that they had made ſo many pyttes in the
erthe to haue therby freſſhe water. And whan
they hadde been there a certayne ſpace / and
well regarded the galees and ſhyppes on the
ſee / ſome of theym entred in to the towne of
Aufryke / to ſe their frendes and alyes / and other
departed agayne to their lodgynges / and
made boſt of their voyage / ſayenge howe the
cryſten men durſt abyde there no lengar / and
ſayd howe their puiſſaunce was nothynge to
regarde / and that they wolde neuer more ſette
ſomoche by the frenche men nor by the genouoys / 
as they had done before. and of this they
ſayd trouth / I ſhall tell you howe & wherfore.
            AFter that this ſiege was thus contynued / 
as I was enfourmed ye ſarazins
waxed proude / for they ſawe well howe the
genouoys had done their full power to hurte
and to anoy them / and they ſawe that this voyage
was to their great coſte / and yet had won
but lytell / whiche was of trouthe. And all that
ſeaſon the ſarazyns knewe nothing of the deth
of ſo many cryſten knyghtes and ſquyers as
were ſlayne at the great ſkrymyſſhe / but the
ſame day that the cryſten men departed / they
had knowledge therof / and I ſhall ſhewe you
by what meanes. The ſarazyns founde in the
felde a varlet of the genouoys / lyenge on the
grounde ſore ſycke of the hote feuer / and was
nat able to go to the galees whan his felowes
departed. And of the fyndynge of this varlet / 
the ſarazyns were ryght ioyfull / and brought
him before their lordes / and ſhewed howe they
had founde hym / than a trucheman was ſet to
here his examynacion. In the begynnynge he
wolde ſhewe nothyng / for he reekened himſelfe
but deed / and he deſyred the ſarazyns incontynent
that they wolde put hym to deth. than
the lordes of the hooſt / as Agadingor Dolyferne / 
Brahadyn of Thunes / and dyuers other / 
thought if they ſhulde cauſe hym to dye
they ſhulde wyn nothyng therby / yet rather to
ſaue his lyfe / ſo yt he wolde ſhewe the trouthe
of that he ſhulde be demaunded. Than it was
ſhewed hym that if he wolde without lyenge
ſhewe the trouth / his lyfe ſhulde be ſaued / and
to be delyuered franke and free / and ſent into
his owne coūtrey by the firſt ſhyp that ſhulde
come thence / outher in to the lande of Geneue
or Marcyll / and alſo that he ſhulde haue gyuen
to hym a. C. beſantes of golde. Whan the
varlet who feared dethe herde this promeſſe
he was well comforted / for he knew well what
ſo euer the ſarazyns promyſe by their faythe
ſhulde be truely kepte / and alſo ye knowe well
naturally euery man is lothe to dye. Than he

ſaid to the truchman. cauſe the lordes to ſwere
on their lawe to vpholde all that ye ſayd / and
than ſhall I aunſwere you to all that I ſhalbe
examyned of / as farre forth as I knowe. The
trucheman ſhewed this to the lordes / and they
made faythfull promeſſe by their fayth to fullfyll
their promeſſe. Than ye varlet ſayd. nowe
demaund what ye wyll / and I ſhall anſwere.
Than firſte he was demaunded of whence he
was. He anſwered and ſayd / he was of Portnances.
Than they demaunded of hym of the
feates of the frenche men that had been at the
ſiege. He named to them dyuers / for he hadde
kepte often tymes cōpany with harauldes / by
whome he had lerned dyuers of their names.
Than they deſyred to knowe ye occaſion why
they departed ſo ſodaynely fro the ſiege. wher
to he anſwered wyſely and ſayd. As for that I
can nat tell / but by ſuppoſynge / and acordyng
as I haue herde ſpoken in our hoſt / as for me
I was neuer a counſayle with the lordes. but
as the brute went / the frenchmen were in doute
of the genouoys that they ſhulde betray them / 
and the genouoys denyed it and ſayd / they neuer
thought it nor neuer wolde / and blamed
the frenchmen yt they ſhulde ſo ſlaunder them.
Alſo it was ſayd that parte of the occaſyon of
their departure was bycauſe the wynter druenere / 
and they were afrayde of taking of ſuche
domage as they had receyued before. what domage
was that quod the lordes. Syrs ꝙ he / 
the ſame daye that ten of our men ſhulde haue
fought with ten of yours / they loſt about a .lx.
knightes and ſquiers of name and armes / the
genouoys ſayd for that cauſe they departed.
They beleued well ye varlet / of whiche newes
the lordes ſarazyns had great ioye. They enquered
of hym no further / but vphelde to him
all their promeſſes / & ſo he retourned to Portnances
and to Geane / and ſhewed all this aduenture / 
and what he had ſaid and herde / and
he receyued no blame therof. Than the ſarazyns
ſayd amonge them ſelfe / they ſhulde nat
nede to care for the frenche men nor for the genouoys
of a longe ſeaſon after / and ſaid howe
before the towne of Aufryke they had taken no
profyte / howe be it they ſayde they wolde take
better hede to their portes and hauens and the
ſee coſtes of their Realmes / and ſpecyally to
the ſtraytes of Marroke they ſet ſure watche / 
that the genouoys nor venyſians ſhulde nat
paſſe that wayes in to Englande / nor in to
Flaunders / with their marchaundyſes / without
payenge of a great trybute / and yet that to
be by greate grace and lycence. Thus the ſarazyns
aſſembled and alyed them togythers
of dyuers realmes / as of Aufryke / Thunes / 
Bogy / Martoke / Belmaryn / Tremeſſyans / 
& Granade / all agreed togyder to kepe ſtraytly
their portes and paſſages / and to ſette galees
armed on the ſee to a great nombre / to the
entent to be lordes and maiſters of the ſee. and
all this they dyd for the great hatred that they
had to the frenchmen and genouoys / bycauſe
they had ben at the ſiege before Aufryke. thus
they dyd great trouble to the goers and commers
on the ſee / ſo that moche yuell and myſchefe
grewe therby / for by meanes that the ſarazyns
were thus lordes of the ſee / ſuche marchaundyſes
as came fro Dāmas / fro Cayrel
fro Alexaunder / fro Venyce / fro Naples / and
fro Geane / were in yt ſeaſon ſo dere in Flaunders
and ſo ſcarce / that many thynges coulde
nat be gotte / nouther for golde no ſyluer / and
ſpecially all ſpycery was wonderfull dere and
gayſon.
            YE haue herd here before howe the cryſten
men departed for the ſiege of Aufryke.
They all paſſed the ſee / but all
aryued nat at one porte / for ſome were ſo ſore
tourmented on the ſee / that they retourned in
great daunger / howe be it ſome of theym returned
to Geane. Proceſſyons were made in
Fraūce for their good ſpede / for there was no
tydynges herde of them. The lady of Coucy / 
the lady of Sulley / the lady Dolphyn of Auuergne / 
and other ladyes of Fraūce / who had
their huſbandes in this voyage were in great
ſorowe / as longe as the voyage endured. and
whan tydynges came howe they were paſſed
the ſee / they were ryght ioyfull. The duke of
Burbone and the lorde of Coucy retourned
priuely / and lefte behynde them all their caryage
and trayne / and ſo they came to Parys aboute
ſaynte Martyns tyde in wynter. The
frenche kynge was ioyouſe of their comynge / 
as it was reaſon / and demaunded of them tydinges
of Barbary / and of their voyage. they
ſhewed al that they knewe / and had herde and
ſene. The kynge and the duke of Thourayne
were glad to here them ſpeke. Than the kyng
ſayd / if we can bringe it aboute to make peace
in the churche / and bytwene vs and Englāde / 

we ſhall gladly make a voyage with an army
royall in to thoſe parties / to exalte the cryſten
fayth / and to confounde the infydels and to acquyte
the dedes of our predeceſſours / as kyng
Ppilyp and kinge Iohan / for they bothe eche
after other tooke on them the croſſey / to haue
gone to the holy lande / and they had gone thyder
if ye warres had nat fallen in their realme.
In lyke wyſe we wolde gladly make ſuche a
voyage. Thus the Frenche kynge comuned
with theſe lordes / and ſo the day paſſed / and
lytell and lytell men came home fro their voyage / 
and the kynge helde hym ſelfe that ſeaſon
moſt comenly at Parys / ſomtyme at ye caſtell
of Lowre / and a nother tyme in the howſe of
ſaynt Powle / where the quene moſt comenly
laye. So it fell in the ſame ſeaſon aboute the
feeſt of ſaynt Andrewe / and that all knyghtes
and ſquyers were retourned fro their voyage
into Barbary / wherof all yt worlde ſpake. than
in the frenche kynges court there was a mocyon
moued for a newe iourney to be made thyder.
And bycauſe that the frenche kynge had
gret affection to dedes of armes / he was counſayled
and exorted therto / and it was ſayde to
hym. Syr ye haue deuocyon and great ymagynacion
to go ouer the ſee / to fyght agaynſt
the infydels / and to conquere the holy lande.
That is trewe quod the kynge / my thought
nyght and day is on none other thyng. and as
I was enfourmed / it was ye 
               lord of Tremoyle
and ſir Iohan Mercier that had theſe wordes
to the king / for they owed their fauour to pope
Clement beynge at Auignon. and loke what
they two ſayd ye kyng wolde agre to them / for
they were moſt ſpeciall in fauour. Than they
ſayd to the kynge. Syr ye can nat with good
conſcience take on you this voyage / with out
firſt the church be all one. ſyr begyn firſt at the
heed / than your enterpriſe ſhall take good concluſyon.
Why quod the kynge where wolde ye
haue me to begyn? Syr quod they at this preſent
tyme ye be nat charged with any great buſyneſſe / 
ye haue treuce with the englyſſhe men
for a longe ſpace. wherfore ſyr if it pleaſe you
this peace durynge / ye myght make a goodly
voyage. and ſyr we can ſe no better nor more
honourable a voyage for you / thanne to go to
Rome with a great puyſſaunce of men of armes / 
and pull downe and dyſtroy that antepaye / 
whome the romayns by force hath created
and ſet in the ſeate cathedrall of ſaynt Peter / 
if ye wyll ye maye well accomplyſſhe this
voyage / and we ſuppoſe ye can nat paſſe your
tyme more honorably. And ſyr / ye maye well
know that if this antepape and his cardynals
knowe ones yt ye be mynded to come on them
with an army / they wyll yelde them ſelf / & aſke
mercy. The kynge remēbred hym ſelfe a lytell
and ſayd / howe he wolde do as they had deuyſed / 
for ſurely he ſaid he was moche bounde to
pope Clement / for the yere paſt he had ben at
Auygnon / where as the pope and his cardynals
made hym ryght honourable chere / and
had gyuen more than was demaunded / bothe
to hym ſelfe / to his brother / and to his vncles / 
wherfore the kynge ſayd it hadde deſerued to
haue ſome recompence. and alſo at his departure
fro Auignon / he had promyſed the pope
to helpe & to aſſyſt hym in his quarell. At that
ſeaſon there was at Parys with the kyng / the
dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne. than it was
agreed and concluded that the nexte Marche
after the kynge ſhuld departe fro Parys / and
take the way towardes Sauoy and Lombardy / 
and the erle of Sauoy to ſende his coſyn
Germayne with hym / and the kynge to haue
vnder his charge the duke of Tourayne his
brother with four thouſande ſpeares / and the
duke of Burgoyne with two thouſande ſpeares / 
and the duke of Berrey two thouſāde / the
conſtable of Fraunce two thouſande ſpeares / 
with the bretons / raintoners and lowe marches / 
the duke of Burbon a thouſāde ſpeares / 
the lorde of ſaynt Poll and the lorde of Coucy
a thouſande ſpeares / & all theſe men of armes
to be payed in hande for thre monethes / and
ſo fro terme to terme. And whan thoſe tydynges
were knowen in Auignon / pope Clement
and his cardynals were greatly reioyſed / and
thought in a maner their enterpriſe atcheued.
Alſo the kinge was coūſayled nat to leaue the
duke of Bretayne behynde hym / but to ſende
and to deſyre hym to prepare hym ſelfe to go
with him in this voyage. The kyng wrote notably
to hym / and ſent his letters by a man of
honour an offycer of armes / ſignyfyenge the
duke in his letters the ſtate of this voyage.
Whan the duke had red theſe letters he turned
hym ſelfe & ſmyled / and called to hym the lorde
of Mountboucher and ſayd. Syr harke and
regarde well what the frenche kyng hath written
to me / he hath enterpriſed to departe this
next Marche with a great puiſſaunce to go to

Rome and to diſtroy ſuche as take parte with
pope Bonyface. As god helpe me his iourney
ſhall tourne to nothynge / for in ſhorte ſpace he
ſhall haue more flax to his dyſtaffe than he can
well ſpynne / I thynke he wyll leaue ſoone his
folyſſh thought. And alſo he deſyreth me to go
with hym with two thouſande ſpeares / howebeit
I wyll honour him as I ought to do / and
I wyll write to him ioyouſly / bycauſe he ſhall
be contente / and ſhewe hym / howe if he go in
this voyage he ſhall nat go without me / ſeyng
it pleaſeth him to haue my company / howe be
it ſir of Moūtboucher I ſay vnto you / I wyll
nat traueyle a man of myne for all yt the kyng
hath purpoſed and ſayd / nothynge ſhall there
be done in that behalfe. The duke of Bretayne
wrote goodly letters and ſwete to the frenche
kynge / and the officer of armes returned with
theym to Parys / and delyuered them to the
kynge / who redde them and was well contented
with the aunſwere.

men of warre with the kynge. Howe be it this
voyage tourned to nothynge / as the duke of
Bretayne had ſayd before / and I ſhall ſhewe
you by what incidence. About ye feeſt of Candelmas
came other tydynges to the Frenche
kyng and to his counſayle / whiche they loked
nothynge for. Certayne of the kynge of Englandes
coūſayle / and ſuche as were of his priuy

legacyon was / ſyr Thomas Percy / ſyr Loys
Clyfforde / and ſir Robert Briquet / with dyuers
other knyghtes in their company / but I
herde as than no mo named. Whan theſe thre
knyghtes were come to Parys to hym / than
the french kyng was deſyrous to knowe what

dyd ſende ſo haſtely of his counſayle to hym.
Theſe knyghtes of Englande / ſyr Thomas
Percy and other / alyghted in Parys in the

they lept on their horſes ryght honorably and

And ſyr we be come hyder for this entente

that ſir Robert Briquet hath nothynge / 
who is a knight of our maiſters preuy chambre.
Sir we deſyre to knowe the cauſe why:
therto anſwered the frenche kyng and ſayd.
Sir Thomas / the knyght that ye ſpeke of / 
ſyth ye wyll knowe yt mater. he hath no nede
to be in batayle agaynſt me / for if he were taken
priſoner his raunſome ſhulde ſoone be

and of the crownyng of kynge
Henry his ſonne. Cap. C .lxxvi.
            
               YE haue herde here before
in this hyſtorie / how peace was
made bytwene the kynge of Caſtyle
and the duke of Lancaſtre / 
who chalenged to haue ryght to
the realme of Caſtyle / by reaſon of the lady
Cuſtaunce his wyfe / doughter to kyng Dō
               peter.
And by meanes of a fayre doughter yt
the duke of Lancaſtre had by the ſayde lady
Cuſtaunce / the peace was made and confyrmed.
For the ſayde kynge Iohan of Caſtyle
had a ſonne to his heyre / called Henry / who
was prince of Galyce. This Henry was maryed
to the duke of Lancaſters Doughter / 
wherby good peace was made bytwene Englande
and Caſtyle: and within two yeres
after this maryage kynge Iohan of Caſtyle
dyed / and was buryed in Burgus in Spaygne.
Anone after his dethe / the prelates and
lordes of Spaygne drewe toguyder / and determyned
to crowne the yonge herytoure the
prince of Galyce. This prince Henry was
crowned the nynth yere of his age / and his
wyfe doughter to the duke of Lancaſtre was
a fyfteene yere of age. Thus the dukes doughter
by the lady Cuſtaunce was quene of Caſtyle / 
and lady and heritour to all the landes
and ſeignories / that kyng Dompeter / kyng
Henry / and kyng Iohan helde / excepte that
the duke of Lācaſtre her father and his wyfe
her mother had durynge their lyues / whiche
was a penſyon of a hundred thouſande doreyns
by yere: And foure of the beſt erles of
Spayne were pledges and dettours for the
ſame. Thus the duke of Lancaſtre ſawe his
two doughters (one quene of Spaygne / the
other quene of Portugale) beſtowed.
            ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the yonge erle of
Armynake / and of the voyage he made in to
Lombardy / for the matter requyreth it: and

            ¶Of the army of the yonge erle Iohan
of Armynake / and of the vyage
that he made in to Lombardy: And
howe he dyed at the ſiege before the
towne of Alexandre. Ca. C .lxxvii.
            
               IT hath been ſhewed
here before / what great of
fectyon the yonge Erle of
Armynake had to go in to
Lombardy with menne of
warre / to ayde and aſſyſte
his ſuſter germayne / and
his brother in lawe her huſbande the lorde
Barnabo / eldeſt ſonne to the lorde Barnabo
whome the duke of Myllayne had cauſed to

be ſlayne marueylouſlye. And this duke of
Myllayne was erle of Vertues / and named
Galeas / Whoſe doughter the duke of Orlyaunce
hadde to wyfe. This ſayd lady / who
was doughter to the olde erle of Armynake
and ſuſter to the yonge erle / was greatly abaſſhed
and diſconforted / and had no truſte
but on her brother. She ſignified to hym all
her eſtate / her pouertie and neceſſyte / and dō
               mage
that ſhe ſuffred: And humbly requyred
her brother / that he wolde helpe to kepe
and defende her agaynſt the tyraunt the erle
of Vertues / who wolde diſheryte her without
any tytell of reaſon. And to the requeſt
of his ſuſter the erle of Armynake condiſcended / 
and ſayde. That what ſoeuer it ſhulde
coſte hym / he wolde do his deuoyre to ayde
his ſuſter. And all that he promyſed he accō
               pliſſhed
in dede. for he had by the ayde of the
erle Dolphyne of Auuergne / made dyuers
treaties in Auuergne / Rouergue / Quercy / 
Lymoſyn / Piergourte / Engoulmoys / and
Agenoyes / and had bought certayne fortreſſes
whiche had been kepte by the Englyſſhe
men / gaſcoyns / and bretons / ſuche as hadde
made warre agaynſt the realme of Fraunce / 
vnder colour of the kyng of Englande / and
all ſuche as he hadde agreed withall / hadde
their pardons of the Frenche kyng: and beſyde
that / the kyng gaue golde and ſyluer to
be gyuen amonge theym. But they were all
bounde to the erle of Armynake / to go with
hym in to Lōbardy to ayde hym in his warres
there. And euery man ſhewed hym ſelfe
therto well wyllynge / & euery man drewe to
the ryuer of Roſne and to ye ryuer of Soſne.
The duke of Berrey and the duke of Burgoyne
ſuffred them in their countreys to take
vitaylles at their pleaſure / for they wolde
gladly haue had them clene delyuered out of
the countre. And in yt ſeaſon vnder the kyng
there ruled in the Dolphynry / the lorde Engueram
Durdyn. And the kynge had written
to hym / commaundyng that theſe men of
warre parteynyng to the erle of Armynake / 
ſhulde peſably paſſe throughe the countrey / 
and to haue that they neded for their money.
            WHan the erle of Foiz beynge in Byerne
in his caſtell of Ortays / vnderſtode
howe the erle of Armynake aſſembled
men of warre toguyder / he began to
muſe / for he was a man greatly ymaginatife
Well he had herde howe the brute was / that
the erle of Armynake made this aſſemble to
go in to Lōbardy agaynſt the lorde of Myllaygne.
But bycauſe in tyme paſt the erle of
Armynake and his predeceſſours before him
and his brother Bernarde of Armynake had
made hym warre / therfore he douted leſt the
ſayde aſſemble ſhulde tourne agaynſt hym.
wherfore he thought he wolde nat be vnprouyded / 
but prepared his fortreſſes with men
of warre / and made ſuche prouyſion / that if
he were aſſayled / to reſyſt it with all his puiſſaunce.
But the erle of Armynake nor his
brother were nothynge of that purpoſe / but
thought ſurely to vpholde ye treuce that was
bytwene them / and to atcheue his enterprice
in to Lombardy. There were many knyghtes
and ſquyers Englyſſhe / gaſcoyns / bretons
and other that were bounde to ſerue the
erle of Armynake in his warres. But if he
ſhulde haue made warre agaynſt the erle of
Foiz / they wolde haue taken the erle of Foiz
parte / and haue forſaken the erle of Armynake / 
the erle of Foiz was ſo welbeloued with
all men of warre / for the wyſedome / largeſſe
and proweſſe that was in hym. And whan̄e
the ducheſſe of Thourayne was enfourmed
howe therle of Armynake was redy to paſſe
ouer the mountayns / to entre in to Lombardy
with puiſſaunce of men of warre / to make
warre agaynſt the duke of Myllayne her
father. And howe that the Frēche kyng and
his vncles / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
conſented therto / bycauſe they wolde
haue their countreis clene auoyded of the cō
               panyons
and routes of pyllars / ſuche as had
often tymes greued ſore their coūtreys. this
lady thought nat to forgette the matter / but
wrote to her father the duke of Millayne / all
that ſhe knewe / to the entente that he ſhulde
take hede to hym ſelfe / and to his countrey.
The lorde of Myllayne was well enformed
of the buſyneſſe / and prouyded for menne of
warre where he might gette them / and refreſſhed
his townes / cyties / and caſtelles with
vitayle / and other munyſiōs of warre.
and loked ſurely to haue warre
with the erle of Armynake / 
as they
hadde in
dede.
            
               
ABout the myddes of the moneth of
Marche / the mooſt parte of theſe cō
               panyons
were aſſembled toguyder
in the marcheſſe of Auignon / all a longe the
ryuer of Roſne / to the nombre of fyftene thouſande
horſes / and paſſed the ryuer: and ſo entred
in to the Dolphynny of Vyen / and lodged
abrode in the vyllages / and ſome paſſed
forwarde to haue the more eaſy paſſage thoroughe
the mountayns / whiche were peryllous
to paſſe / bothe for man and horſe. The
erle of Armynake and his brother / with certayne
other knyghtes wente to Auygnon / to
ſe hym that was called pope Clemente / and
the cardynalles there. And offred their ſeruyce
to the pope / to ayde hym agaynſt the tyrantes
the lombardes / for whiche offre they
were thanked. And whan they had ben there
an eight dayes / and that great parte of their
company were paſte forwarde / They tooke
their leaue of the pope and of the cardynalles / 
and prepared to folowe their men. there
the two bretherne departed a ſondre / the erle
Iohan of Armynake and ſir Bernarde his
brother. Than the Erle ſayde. Brother / ye
ſhall retourne backe to Armynake and kepe
our herytage / of Comynges and Armynake
For as yet all the fortreſſes be nat delyuered
fro the companyons. There is as yet the garyſon
of Lourde / where as Peter Arnaulte
kepeth vnder the kynge of Englande: And
alſo the garyſon of Bounteuyll / whiche is
kepte by ſir Iohan of Granley / ſonne to the
Captall of Buſe. And thoughe it be ſo / that
as nowe we haue peace with the erle of Foiz
yet it is good to doubte hym / for he is cruell
and haſtye: his thought is vnknowen / therfore
it is good that our landes be nat dyſpurueyed.
Wherfore Brother / for theſe cauſes &
other ye ſhall retourne home / and ye ſhalle
here often fro me and I fro you. Sir Bernarde
lightlye agreed to this purpoſe. The
deuyſe ſemed good to hym. Nor alſo he had
no great affeccyon to go forthe in that iournay.
Than at his departynge / the erle his
brother ſayde to hym. Brother / in youre retournyng
ye ſhall go to our coſyn Raymonde
of Thourayne / who holdeth lande of the
pope in the countie of Venus / and maketh
warre agaynſt hym / and my coſyn hath maryed
his doughter to the prince of Orenge / 
and ſhewe hym howe I am deſyred of the
pope / to requyre hym to go with me in this
voyage / and I ſhall make hym my companyon
in euery thynge / and I ſhall tary for
hym at the cytie of Gappe bytwene ye mountayns.
Sir quod Bernarde I ſhall do your
meſſage. Thus the two bretherne departed
a ſondre in the felde / and neuer mette to guyder
agayne after. The erle of Armynake toke
the waye to the cytie of Gappe in ye lande
of Ganos. And Bernarde his brother went
to the caſtell of Bolongne / where ſir Raymonde
of Thouraygne was / who receyued
his coſyn ioyouſly. Than ſir Bernarde ſhewed
hym the meſſage that he had to ſaye / fro
his brother the erle of Armynacke / with as
fayre wordes as he coulde deuyſe / the rather
therby to enclyne hym therto. Than ſir Raymonde
aunſwered and layd. Fayre coſyn / or
your brother the erle of Armynake be entred
farre in to Lōbardy / and hath beſieged any
towne / I ſhall folowe hym / but as yet it is
to ſoone for me and my men to go forwarde.
Write vnto your brother my coſyn / yt aboute
the moneth of Maye I ſhall folowe hym. &
by ye tyme I truſt to haue an ende of the war
betwene myne vncle pope Clement / and the
cardinals at Auignon & me / who as yet wyll
do me no ryght / and kepeth awaye fro me ꝑforce / 
that myne vncle pope Gregorie gaue
me. they wene to wery me / but they ſhall nat
They deſyre knyghtes and ſquyers / and gyueth
theym pardons to make warre agaynſt
me / but they haue no lyſt therto. For I canne
haue mo men of warre for a thouſande Floreyns
in one daye / than they can haue for all
their abſolucions in ſeuyn yere. Fayre coſyn
quod ſir Bernarde that is trewe. Kepe on
your purpoſe / I wolde nat counſayle you otherwyſe.
And as ye haue aunſwered me / ſo
ſhall I write to my brother therle of Armynake.
So be it quod ſir Raymonde. Thus
they were toguyder all a hole daye. Than̄e
ſir Bernarde departed and paſſed the ryuer
of Roſne at the bridge. Saynt Eſpyrite / and
ſo retourned in to Query and in to Rouergue
by the mountayns / and ſo came thyder
as he wolde be / and lefte the erle of Armynake
his brother alone with his warre / againſt
the duke of Myllayne erle of Vertues. Or
he departed fro Bolonge he wrote to his brother
all the newes that he knewe / and the anſwere
of ſir Raymonde of Thourayne. The

erle of Armynake receyued the letters in the
waye goyng to the cytie of Gappe. He redde
the letters / and ſo paſſed forthe and made no
great force of the matter.
            WE wyll contynue to ſpeke of the
yonge erle of Armynacke and
ſhewe his feate / or I ſpeke of any
other mater. And thus I ſay
The good loue and great affection
that he had to conforte his ſuſter & brother
in lawe her huſbande / whom the erle of
Vertues / who called hym ſelfe lorde of Myllaygne
falſely diſheryted withoute cauſe or
tytell
                  •
                cauſed the erle ioyouſly to paſſe in his
iourney as farre as Pyemount in Lombardy.
There was two great reaſons that cauſed
the erle of Armynake to aſſemble / and to
make that iourney at that tyme. The fyrſte
was / that the realme of Fraunce therby was
clene rydde of the routes of theſe companyons / 
that hadde done moche hurte in the reaime / 
and therby the countreys better aſſured
than they were before. The ſeconde reaſon
was to ayde his ſuſter / for he had great
pytie that ſhe and her huſbande ſhulde leſe
their herytage / wherby they ſhulde lyue and
maynteyne their eſtate / and for theſe conſyderacions
he toke on hym this enterprice. The
capitayns of the companyons ſayde one to another.
Lette vs ryde forthe merily agaynſt
theſe lombardꝭ / we haue a good quarell and
a inſte tytell / and we haue a good capitayne / 
wherby our warre ſhalbe moche the better.
And alſo we ſhall go in to the beſt countrey
of all the worlde / for Lombardy receyueth
fro all coſtes the fatneſſe of the worlde: and
the e lombardes be naturally euer riche and
cowardes: We ſhall attayne agaynſt theym
moche profyte: There is none of vs that be
capitayns / but that ſhall retourne ſo ryche / 
that we ſhall neuer nede to make warre more
agaynſt any man. Thus the companyons de
uſed one with another / and whan they came
in to a plentuous countrey / there they wolde
tary a ſeaſon to refreſſhe them and their horſes.
            In the ſame ſeaſon the good abuēturous
fought of Englande ſir Iohan Hacton was
in the marcheſſe of Florēce / and made warre
agaynſt the florētyns / in the quarell of pope
Bonyface of Rome / for they were rebell agaynſt
the popes cōmaundement / and ſo were
alſo the Peruſyns. The erle of Armynake
thought that if he might get this Englyſſhe
knyght to take parte with hym / he ſhulde haue
a great treaſure of hym / bycauſe of his
wyſedome & valyauntneſſe. The erle wrote
to hym / ſignyfieng hym all the hole mater of
his enterprice / deſyringe hym of his ayde.
Whiche letter was ſente by a diſcrete perſon
to ſir Iohan Hacton beyng in the marcheſſe
of Florence / and had a two thouſande fyghtynge
men. He receyued the letter and redde
it. And whan he hadde well vnderſtande all
the ſubſtaunce therof he was ryght ioyfull / 
and aunſwered and ſayde. That his owne
warre ones atchyued / he wolde do nothyng
after / tyll he were in the company of the erle
of Armynake. The meſſanger ſayde. Sir
ye ſaye well / I requyre you write your mynde
to my lorde the erle of Armynake / he wyll
the better beleue it. With ryght a good wyll
ſir quod the knight / it is reaſon that I ſo do.
Than the Englyſſhe knyght wrote / and delyuered
the letter to the meſſangere / who retourned
and came agayne to his lorde / and
founde hym as than in the marcheſſe of Pyneroll / 
where was gret treatie bitwene hym
and the Marques of Salues / who ſhulde
be alyed with hym / to ayde him in his warre
agaynſt the duke of Myllayne erle of Vertues.
            
               THe tidynges that the erle of Armynackes
Squyer brought to
hym fro ſir Iohan Hacton / and
of the Wordes that were written
within the letter / The Erle
was greatly reioyſed and ſayd. that he truſted
to make ſuche warre to the duke of Myllayne / 
that he wolde bring hym to reaſon / or
elles to dye in the payne. Whan all his company
were paſſed the ſtraytes of the mountayns / 
and were in the good countrey of Piemounte
nere Thouraygne. Than they rode
abrode / and dyde moche hurte in the vyllages / 
ſuche as coude nat holde agaynſt them.
Than the erle layde ſige before Aſte in Pyemount / 
& entended to rary there for ſir Iohn̄
Hacton. Prouiſyon came to them fro all partes / 
and alſo the companyons wan certayne

ſmall holdes / and toke the vitayls that was
within them. The countre of Pyneroll / and
the landes of the Marques Mount feraunt
were opyned and apparelled to delyuer vytayles / 
& other thynges nerceſſary for ye hooſt
bothe for men and horſe. And alſo great prouiſyon
came to them out of ye Dolphyne and
out of the countie of Sauoy. Many folkes
greatly enclyned to the erle of Armynake / bycauſe
they ſawe his quarell was good & iuſt / 
and alſo bycauſe the erle of Vertues had cauſed
to be ſlayne his owne vncle ſir Bernabo
for enuy / to ſette agayne the lordes of Lombardy
in to their herytages / and diſheryted
his coſyn germayns / wherof many great lordes / 
thoughe they ſpake but lytell therof / yet
they hadde great pytie of the caſe. Whyle the
erle laye thus at ſiege before Aſte / he herde tidynges
of ſir Iohn̄ Hacton / wherof he was
greatlye reioyſed. The tidynges was / that
the florentynes were come to the popes mercye / 
and alſo the Veniſyens. And howe that
the ſayd ſir Iohn̄ ſhulde haue threſcore thouſande
Floreyns / for hym and his company.
And that money ones payde / receyued / and
delyuered / where as it ſhulde be departed / 
than he promyſed with a fyue hundred ſpeares
and a thouſande brigans a fote / to come
in to the fronter of Gēnes / and to paſſe ouer
the ryuer / wheder their ennemeys wolde or
natte / and ſo to come to the erle of Armynake
where ſoeuer he ſhulde be. Theſe tidynges
greatlye reioyſed the erle of Armynake and
all his company / for the ayde of this ſir Iohn̄
Hacton was right pleaſaunt. Than the erle
of Armynake was counſailed to deꝑte thens
and to go and laye ſiege before a great cytie
called Alexandre / at the entryng of Lōbardy
and whan̄e they had won that / than to go to
Breſuell / whiche was alſo a good cytie and
a fayre.
            THus the erle of Armynake and his
company layde ſiege before the cyte
of Alexaundre / ſtandyng in a fayre
countrey and a playne. at the departyng out
of Pyemount and at the entrynge of Lombardy / 
and the way to go to the ryuer of Gē
               nes.
Theſe men of warre paſſed the ryuer of
Theſyn and lodge at their eaſe at large / for
the countrey was good and pleſaunt there aboute.
The Lorde Galeas lorde of Myllayne
and erle of Vertues / was as than in a
towne called the cytie of Pauy / and daylye
herde tidynges what his enemyes dyde / but
he had marueyle of one thynge / howe therle
of Armynake coude gette the rycheſſe to pay
wages to ſo many men of warre as he hadde
brought with hym / but his counſayle anſwered
hym and ſayde. Sir / haue no marueyle
therof / for the men that he hath be ſuche companyons / 
that deſyreth to wynne and to ryde
at aduenture. They haue vſed longe to ouerron
the realme of Fraūce / and to take holdes
and garyſons in the countrey / ſo that ye countrey
coude neuer be delyuered of them. And
ſo it is / that nowe of late the duke of Berrey
and the Dolphyn of Auuergne / to whoſe coū
               treys
theſe rutters dyde moche dōmage / for
they kepte them there againſt the lordes wylles / 
and ouer ranne the beſt parte of their he
rytages / and made theym warre. And they
cauſed the Erle of Armynake to treate with
theſe companyons / ſo that the Frenche kyng
ſhulde ſuffre thē to come in to this your coutrey
to make warre. And therby / and by meanes
of certayne money gyuen to them / they
are auoyded oute of all the fortereſſes in the
countrey. And alſo beſyde that / the Frenche
kynge hath ꝑdoned all ſuche as made warre
agaynſt hym / on ye cōdycion that they ſhulde
ſerue the erle of Armynake in his warres / &
all that they coude get ſhulde be their owne.
They demaunde none other wages. And ſuche
be named men of armes amonge theym / 
with a fyue or ſixe horſes / that if they were in
their owne countreys they wolde go a foote / 
and be but as poore men. It is great parell
and ieopardy to fyght agaynſt ſuche men / &
alſo lightly they be all good men of warre.
Wherfore ſir / the beſt counſayle that we can
gyue you / is to kepe your townes and fortreſſes / 
they be ſtronge and well prouyded for / 
and your ennemyes haue none artyllary nor
engyns / for the ſaute to be regarded. They
maye well come to the barryers of your townes
and ſcrimyſſhe / other dōmage they can
do none. And this appereth well / for they haue
ben in your coūtrey this two monethes / &
as yet haue taken no fortreſſe lytell nor gret.
Sir let them alone / and they ſhall wery thē
ſelfe / and be diſtroyed at the ende / ſo ye fyght
nat with them. And whan they haue diſtroyed
the playne countre / and haue no more to

lyue by: They ſhall than be fayne to returne
for famyne / without any other yuell fortune
fall on them in the meane tyme. And it ſhall
be well done that your men of warre in your
fortreſſes kepe toguyder to ayde eche other / 
in tyme of nede. And ſir / ſende to ſuche places
as ye thynke your enemyes wyll beſiege
to reſyſt thē / for townes men haue but ſmall
defēce / for they be nat ſo vſed nor accuſtomed
to warre / nouther to aſſaut nor to defende as
men of armes knightes and ſquyers be / who
are noriſſhed & brought vp therin. ſir / ſende
your men of warre to the cytie of Alexandre / 
Therby ye ſhall haue double profyte. your
cytie ſhalbe defended and your people ſhall
loue you the better / whan they ſe ye do ayde
and confort them. And ſir therto ye be boūde
ſithe ye haue gouernaunce ouer them / & that
they paye to you their rentes / ſubſydies / & aydes
that ye haue demaunded of them dyuers
tymes. your enemyes can nat be ſo ſtrong in
the felde before Alexaundre / that the towne
ſhulde be cloſed in rounde about: they haue
no ſuche nombre to do it / wherfore your men
ſhall entre in to the towne at their caſe. And
whan they of the towne ſhall ſe them ſel
                  •
                e refreſſhed
with your men of warre / they ſhall
haue ye more corage / and loue you moche the
better / and ſhall putte out of their hertes all
maner of treatie with your ennemyes. To
this counſaile the lorde of Mayllayne greed
and incontynent he aſſembled toguyder his
men of warre a fyue hundred ſpeares. And
he made capitayne of thē an auncient knight
called ſir Iaques of Byerne / an expert man
of armes / and they rode through the coūtrey
priuely / and ſo on a nyght they entred in to
the towne of Alexaundre. They of the towne
were greatly reioyſed of their cōmyng / and
good cauſe why. Bycauſe the erle of Armynake
ſawe no menne ſtyrynge in the towne.
Therfore thre dayes toguyder they ſauted &
ſcrimyſſhed at the barriers / and yet with the
ſmall nombre that were there / the armynakꝭ
were ſo well reſyſted that they wan nothyng
Whan ſir Iaques de la Byerne and his company
were entred in to the ſtrong cyte of Alexaundre
and were lodged and refreſſhed / the
gouernour of the cytie and other came to vyſite
thē in their lodgynge. Than ſir Iaques
demaunded of them the ſtate of the cyte / and
the demeanour of their enemyes / to take coū
               ſayle
thervpon. The anncient men and moſt
ſageſt anſwered and ſayd. Sir / ſithe the erle
of Armynake hath layde ſiege before vs / euery
daye we haue had aſſautes & ſcrimyſſhes
before our barryers. Well ſirs ꝙ the knyght
to morowe we ſhall ſe what they wyll do.
They knowe nat of my cōmyng / I wyll make
a ſecrete iſſue / and lye in an enbuſſhe for
them. Ah ſir quod they / ye haue nede to be
ware what ye do / for they are a ſixtene thouſande
horſes / and if they diſcouer you in the
felde without any bataile / they ſhall reyſe ſuche
a duſt with their horſes agaynſt you and
your company / that ye ſhalbe clene diſconfit
among your ſelfe. Well quod the knyghtes / 
to mo. owe we ſhall ſe howe the mater ſhall
go. We muſt do ſome feate of armes ſithe we
become hyder. Than euery man retourned
to their lodging / and the knight gaue know
ledge to his cōpany / howe that the next mornyng
ſecretely he wolde iſſue out of the cytie
and lye in a buiſhment in the feldes / and cō
               maunded
euery man to be redy.
            THe nexte mornyng ſir Iaques dela
Bierne armed hym and all his company / 
and iſſued out ſecretely / and
with hym a ioure hundred / halfe a myle outs
of the towne / and aſſembled in a valey / and
cauſed other two hundred to abyde at ye barriers.
And cōmaunded them / that if their enemyes
came to aſſayle them / that they ſhulde
make but faynt defence / and recule backe thy
derwarde / where as they wolde lye in ye buſſhement.
The daye was fayre and clere and
the erle of Armynake who was yong and luſty / 
after he had herde maſſe in his pauilyon / 
armed hym and diſplayed his penon / & toke
with hym but a hundred men / thynking that
no man ſhulde encountre hym. And ſo came
with his company before the barryers lytell
and lytell / ſome folowed hym and ſome ſatte
ſtyll & ſayd. What nede we to arme vs / whan
we come to the barryers we ſhall ſe no man
there / and ſo ſatte ſtyll eatyng and drinkyng
and therle of Armynake went to ſcrimyſſhe
before the barryers / and there began to ſcrimyſſhe
one with another. & within a ſhorte
ſeaſon the defenders beganne to recule lytell
and lytell / tyll they came to their enbuſſhe.
Whan ſir Iaques de la Bierne ſawe his enemyes
cōe before hym / he diſcouered hymſelfe

and ſet on the acmynagoys / who valyauntly
defēded themſelfe / for alwayes lytell and lytell
ſocour came to them / there was many a feate
of armes done. It was on ſaynte Chriſtofers
daye / and the daye was ſo hoote that ſuche as
were in their harnes / thought verily they had
ben in a furnes / the wether was ſo faynt with
out wynde / ſo that the luſtyeſt they had moche
a do to do any feate of armes. The partye of
Myllayne were thre agaynſt one. The duſte
and the powder was ſo great that they coulde
ſcante ſe one a nother / and ſpecially they of the
erle of Armynakes parte. There fell to the erle
a great aduenture / he was ſo oppreſſed with
heate / that he was ſo feble that he coulde ſcant
helpe him ſelfe / ſo that he drewe aparte out on
the one ſyde of the felde and no man with him / 
and there founde a lytell ryuer / whan he felte
the ayre of the water he thought he was in paradyſe / 
and ſate downe alone beſyde the water / 
and with moche payne dyd of his baſenet
and ſate bareheded / and waſſhed his face and
dranke of ye water / wherby he was worſe than
he was before / for the coldneſſe of the water coled
ſo his blode that he was faynter thanne he
was before / and fell in a palueſy / ſo that he loſt
the ſtrength of his body and ſpeche / and his
men had loſte hym. there were many taken.
After a knight of the duke of Millayns foūde
the erle of Armynake. Whan he ſawe hym he
had meruayle what he was / he parceyued wel
he was a knyght & a man of honour. Than the
knight ſaid. Sir who be you? yelde you ye are
my pryſoner. The erle vnderſtode hym nat / 
nor he coulde nat ſpeke / but he helde vp his
hande / and made token to yelde hym. The
knyght wolde haue hadde hym to ryſe / but he
coulde nat. The knyght taryed ſtyll with him
whyle other dyd fyght / in the whiche batayle
many a feate of armes was done.
            WHan ſyr Iaques de la Bierne who
was a ſage knyght / ſawe howe the
iourney was good for his party / and
howe that a gret nombre of his enemyes were
taken and ſlayne / and alſo ſawe well that his
owne men world 
                  •
               ery / and that his enemyes
began to multyply with freſſhe men / than he
reculed towarde the cytie ſkrymyſſhynge and
defendynge. The knyght that had taken the
erle of Armynake / thought nat to leaue hym
behynde / for he thought ſurely he was ſome
man of honoure / and deſyred his company to
ayde hym / to beare his priſoner in to ye towne
promyſynge them to haue parte of his raunſome.
They dyd ſo / and with moche payne
brought him in to the cyte / and was vnarmed
and layde in a bedde. Than ſyr Iaques de la
Bierne entred in to the cytie and toke his lodgynge
and vnarmed hym / and refreſſhed him
and his company. And whan the erle of Armynacke
was myſt in the hooſt without / they
were ſore dyſmayed / and wyſt nat what to ſay
nor do / and ſome came to the place where the
batayle had ben to ſeke for hym / and returned
agayne clene dyſcomfyted. The knyght that
had taken the erle of Armynake had great deſyre
to know what man his priſoner was / and
came to another ſquyer that was in lykewyſe
taken priſoner a gaſcon / deſyringe his mayſter
to ſuffre hym to go with hym to his lodgynge.
ſo they went togyder. The lombarde
knyght led the ſquyer of Fraunce in to a chambre / 
and brought hym to the bedde where the
erle of Armynake lay ſore complaynyng / and
cauſed torches to be lyghted vp / and than ſaid
to the french ſquyer. Sir / knowe you nat this
man? The ſquyer regarded hym well & ſayd / 
I knowe hym well for I ought ſo to do / it is
our capitayne the erle of Armynake. With the
whiche wordes the lombarde was ioyfull / but
the Erle was ſo ſycke that he vnderſtode nothynge
that was ſayd to hym. Than his mayſter
ſayd / go we hence let hym reſt. Thus they
left him / and the ſame nyght he dyed / and paſſed
this tranſitory lyfe. The next day whan it
was knowen that the erle of Armynake was
deed in Alexaunder in his bedde / ſyr Iaques
of Bierne wolde nat that his dethe ſhulde be
vnknowen / but cauſed it to be publyſſhed in
the hooſt / by ſuche priſoners as he had / to ſe
what his enemyes wolde do. They of the hoſt
were ſore dyſcomfyted as they well ſhewed / 
for as than they had no capitayne to drawe vnto / 
for they were but companyons gadred of
all partes. Than they ſayd / let vs returne and
ſaue our ſelfe / for we haue loſt our tyme. Anon
it was knowen in the Cytie / howe the armynois
were diſcōfyted / and had no capytayne.
than they armed them / and iſſued out a horſebacke
and a foote / and ſet on the hooſt cryenge
Pauy for the lorde of Myllayne. There they
were taken and ſlayne without defence. The
conqueſt and botye was great with the companyons

that were come thyder with ſyr Iaques
of Bierne the Armynage is yelded them
ſelfe without defence and caſt away armure
and ſledde / and were chaſed lyke beaſtes. Lo
what a harde aduenture therle of Armynake
and his company bad / and where as his entente
was to do well / it tourned hym to great
yuell. If he had lyued fyue dayes lenger / ſyr
Iohan Acton had come to hym with fyue hundred
ſpeares / and a thouſande brigandyns a
foote / wherby he myght haue done many feates
of armes / and all loſt by harde aduenture.
            WHan the duke of Myllayn knewe the
trouth that his enemyes were ſlayne
and taken / and ſpecyally the erle of
Armynake ſlayne / he was ioyfull therof / and
loued ſyr Iaques de Bierne the better in his
herte / and made hym ſoueraygne ouer all his
chyualry / and made him chefe of his coūſayle.
The duke of Myllayne to auoyde his countrey
of his enemyes / gaue to euery pryſoner
that was a gentylman a horſe / and to euery other
man a florayne and quyted them clene of
their raunſomes / but at their departynge he
cauſed them to ſwere that they ſhulde neuer after
arme them agaynſt hym. Thus theſe companions
departed out of Lombardy and Piemount / 
and entred in to Sauoy and in to the
dolpheny / and had ſuche pouertie that it was
marueyle for as they paſſed euery towne was
cloſed agaynſt theym. Anone euery man had
ſpent his florayn / ſome had pytie of them and
dyd gyue them almes for charite / and ſome rebuked
and mocked them / ſayenge. Go your
wayes ſeke out your erle of Armynake / who
is drinkynge at a well before Alexaundre. yet
they were in more myſchiefe whan they came
to the ryuer of Rone they had thought lightly
to haue paſſed ouer in to the realme of Fraūce
but they dyd nat for the frenche kynge hadde
cōmaunded all the paſſages to be cloſed and
kept agaynſt them / wherby they fell in great
daunger and pouertie. After that they coulde
neuer aſſemble togyther agayne. Thus the
yonge erle of Armynakes army brake a ſonder
& his ſuſter abode ſtyll in as yuell caſe as
ſhe was in before. Than ye duke of Myllayne
ſent for a byſſhop of his coūtrey / and for ſuche
as were moſt next to the erle of Armynake / as
had ben there with hym at that iourney / and
the duke cōmaunded that therles body ſhulde
be baumed / and ſente to his brother ſyr Barnarde / 
who was ryght ſorowfull of thoſe tydynges / 
and good cauſe why / but there was
no remedy. Than the erle of Armynake was
buryed in the cathedrall churche of Rodays / 
and there he lyeth.
            IT ought to be knowen as it hath ben
contayned here before in this hiſtory / 
how ſyr Thomas Percy was ſent by
kyng Rycharde of Englande in to the realme
of Fraūce / and ſhewed well howe he had gret
affectyon to haue a ferme peace bytwene Englande
and Fraunce / and ſpecyally two of the
kynge of Englandes vncles / as the duke of
Lancaſtre and the duke Edmonde of yorke / 
but the kynges other vncle the duke of Gloceſtre
and conſtable of Englande / wolde in no
wyſe acorde to haue any peace with the french
men / without it were to the kynges honoure
and theirs / and that there myght be rendred agayne
all ſuche cyties / townes / caſtels / landes
and ſygnories / whiche had been gyuen to the
kynge of Englande and to his heyres / whiche
falſely had ben taken away by the frenchmen / 
without tytell or reaſone / and beſyde that the
ſōme of four thouſande frankes / whiche was
owyng whan the frenchmen began the warre
agayne. And of this opynyon was dyuers lordes
of Englande / ſayenge that to ye dethe they
wolde iuſtifye the ſame. Many ſayd that the
duke of Gloceſtre had good ryght and reaſon
to ſuſtayne that opinyon / but they diſſymuled
the mater couertely / bycauſe they ſawe ye kynges
mynde and affection enclyned greatly to
haue peace. But the poore knightes and ſquyers / 
and archers of England/rather enclyned
to haue warre / ſuche as had ſuſteyned there
eſtates by reaſon of the warre. Conſydre well
than / howe peace / loue / or acorde might be had
bytwene theſe parties / for the frenche men in
their treatie demaunded to haue Ealays beaten
downe / & to haue the ſygnorie of Guyſnes / 
Hammes / Marke / and Dye / & all the landes
of Froyton / and the dependantes of Guyſnes
vnto the lymyttes of the water of Grauelyng.
and the frenche kynge offred to delyuer to the
crowne of Englāde as moch landes in values
in Acquytayn / againſt whiche artycle yt duke
of Glouceſtre helde and ſaid. The frenchmen
wyll paye vs with our owne / for they knowe
well ynough howe we haue charters ſealed by

kynge Iohan / & all his chyldren / that all hole
Acquytayn ſhulde haue been delyuered to vs / 
without any reſorte or ſoueraynte to any man
and all that euer they haue doone ſythe / hath
ben by fraude and falſe engyn / and nyght and
day entende to no other thyng but to diſceyue
vs / for if Calays and ſuche landes as they demaunde / 
were delyuered in to their handes / 
they ſhulde be lordes of all the ſee coſte / and
than all our conqueſtes were as nothynge / I
ſhall rather neuer agree to peace as long as I

            ¶How ſyr Peter of Craon fell in the
french kynges diſpleaſure and in the
duke of Thourayns / & after he was
receyued by the duke of Bretayne.
Cap. C.lxxviii.
            
               IN this ſaid ſeaſō there
was a knyght of Fraunce
of the countrey of Aniou / a
gentle knight and of noble
extraction / called ſyr Pyer
of Craon / marucylouſly
well beloued / and ſpecially
with the duke of Thourayne / for aboute the
duke no thynge was doone but by hym. Alſo
this knyght helde a gret aſtate about the duke
of Aniou / who was called kynge of Naples / 
Cicyll / & Iheruſalem / and alſo he was ryche.
Aſclaunder was brought vp on hym through
the realme of Fraūce / howe he had robbed the
yonge kynge of Cycyll duke of Aniou / for the
whiche brute the ſayd ſir Peter abſented him
ſelfe fro the yonge kynge and fro his mather / 
who had ben wyfe to the olde duke of Aniou / 
howe be it he delte ſo that he was welbeloued
with the frenche kynge / and with his brother
the duke of Thourayne. Alſo the ſame ſeaſon
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / as thanne conſtable of
Fraūce / was greatly in fauour with the kyng
and with the duke of Thourayne / whiche fauour
he had get by reaſon of the good ſeruyce
that he had done in armes / as well in Fraūce
as els where / in the kynges dayes and in his
fathers dayes kinge Charles / and ſir Olyer
of Clyſſons doughter had wedded Iohan of
Bretayne / brother germayne to the quene of
Iheruſalem / and this ſyr Olyuer Clyſſon by
reaſon of the alyaunce that he had by the maryage
of Iohan of Bretayne / was greatly in
the duke of Bretayns indignacion / in ſomoch
that the duke helde him for his mortall enemy / 
and Iohan of Bretayne in lykewyſe / and the
duke of Bretayne repented hym that he had
nat ſlaine ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon whan he had
hym in priſone in his caſtell of Ermyn. This
ſyr Peter of Craon was in ſuche fauour with
the duke of Bretaygne that he myght do with
him what he lyſt / he was his coſyn. and whyle
he was in fauour with the frenche kynge and
with the duke of Thourayn / he wolde gladly
haue brought out of the kynges fauoure ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon the conſtable / if he coulde
haue brought it aboute.
            THus the enuyous whiche couertely always
hath reygned in Fraunce / diſſymuling
their maters tyll they come to an yuell
concluſion. The conſtable of Fraunce had alwayes
ben ſo true in all his dedes to ye crowne
of Fraunce / that euery manne loued hym / except
the duke of Burgoyn / who loued him nothyng.
the hatred came by the duches of Burgoyne / 
who was a lady of hygh corage / for ſhe
coulde nat loue the Conſtable / for the duke of
Bretayne was nere of blod to her / and all that
her father the erle of Flaunders loued ſhe loued / 
and ſuche as he hated ſhe dyd the ſame / 
ſhe was of that condycion. This ſyr Peter of
Craon whyle he was in the frenche court / and
great with the duke of Thourayne / he wrote
often tymes to the duke of Bretayne ſecretly
euery thynge that he knewe / & the duke wrote
agayne to hym. Theffecte of their writynges
I coude nat knowe / how be it I Iohan Froy
ſart auctor of this hyſtory / on a tyme whan I
was at Parys / on a night whan a great myſchefe
was lykely to haue fallen vpon ſir Olyuer
Clyſſon conſtable of Fraunce / by a marueylous
enterpriſe of ſyr Peter of Craon / as
I ſhall herafter more playnly declare / whan
tyme ſhall requyre. And bycauſe I ſawe the
mater darke and obſcure / & lykely to be great
trouble and daunger / I dyd all the payne I
coulde to knowe the grounde and occaſyon of
the mater / why ſyr Peter of Craon was ſo ſodaynly
banyſſhed fro the frenche kynges loue
and the duke of Thourayns. Suche ſerche I

made and ſuche enquery of them that knewe
the mater / that ſome of them enfourmed me of
the trouth as the fame & renome ran. Fyrſt the
duke of Thourayn was dyſpleaſed with this
ſyr Peter of Craon through his owne faute / 
for he dyſcloſed the ſecretneſſe that was bytwene
the duke of Thourayne and another
lady. If he dyd ſo he dyd yuell.
            THe duke of Thourayne as than had
ſuche fauour to ſyr Peter of Craon / 
that he toke hym as his companyon / 
and ware euer lyke apparell / and had hym alwayes
with hym where ſo euer he wente / and
ſhewed hym all his ſecretes. This Duke of
Thourayn as than was yonge and amorous / 
and gladly wolde company with ladyes and
damoſels / and ſporte hym amonge them / and
ſpecially as it was ſhewed me / he loued entierly
a fayre lady of Paris / yonge and freſſh. His
loue and ſecretes were knowen in ſuche wyſe
that it turned to great dyſpleſure to the duke / 
and he wyſte nat whome to blame but ſyr Peter
of Craon / for the duke had ſhewed hym all
his ſecretes in that mater / and had taken hym
in his company / whan he wolde ſecretly ſpeke
with the ſaid yonge lady. The duke on a tyme
promyſed the ſayd lady a thouſande crownes
of golde / ſo that he myght haue his pleaſure of
her. But the lady as than refuſed it and ſayd / 
howe ſhe loued hym nat for his golde nor ſyluer / 
but pure loue enclyned her to beare hym
her good wyll / but as for golde or ſyluer ſhe
wolde nat ſell her honoure. All theſe wordes
and promeſſes were knowen by the duches of
Thourayne / who incontynent ſent for the ſaid
yonge lady in to her chambre. Than ſhe called
her by her name / and in gret diſpleaſure ſayd.
Wylte thou do me wronge with my lorde my
huſband? The yonge lady was abaſſhed / and
all wepynge ſayd. Nay madame by the grace
of god / I neuer dyd thynke it nor neuer wyll.
than the ducheſſe ſayd. Thus it is / Iame enfourmed
that my lorde my huſbande loueth
you / and you him / and the mater ſo farre gone
bytwene you / that in ſuche a place and at ſuche
a tyme he promyſed you a thouſāde crownes
of golde to haue his pleaſer of you / howe be it
ye dyd refuſe it as than / wherin ye dyd wyſely
and therfore as at this tyme I ꝑdon you / but
I charge you as derely as ye loue your lyfe / yt
ye commune nor talke no more with hym / but
ſuffre hym to paſſe / & herkyn nat to his comunynge.
Than whan the yonge lady ſawe her
ſelfe accuſed of trouth ſhe anſwered and ſayd.
Madame / I ſhall delyuer me fro him as ſone
as I can / and ſhall ſo / deale that ye ſhall haue
no cauſe of dyſpleaſure in this mater. Therwith
the ducheſſe gaue her leaue to departe / 
and ſo ſhe returned to her lodgyng. The duke
of Thourayne who knewe nothynge of this
mater / and as he yt entierly loued this yonge
lady / fortuned on a day to come where as ſhe
was. Whanne ſhe ſawe hym ſhe eſchewed his
company / and made hym no maner of ſemblant
of loue / but dyd clene cōtrary to that ſhe
had vſed before / for ſhe durſt nat / and alſo ſhe
had ſworne & promyſed / to the duches. Whan
the duke ſawe her countenaunce he was penſyue / 
and thought he wolde knowe why ſhe
delte ſo ſtraungely / and demaunded of her the
cauſe of her ſtraungnes. The yonge lady all
wepynge ſayd. Syrye haue bewrayed your
loue / and the ſecrete promeſſe an offre that ye
made me / to my lady your wyfe / or els ſome other / 
remembre you wel to whom ye haue ſhewed
your ſecretneſſe / for ſyr I was in great
daunger by my lady your wyfe / and by none
other / and I haue ſworne and promyſed her
that after this tyme I wyll neuer cōpany nor
talke with you / wherby ſhe ſhulde haue any
ielouſy. whan the duke harde yt they were ſore
wordes to him / and greatly to his diſpleaſure
and ſaid. Ah my ſayre lady / I ſwere to you by
my faythe / that rather than this mater ſhulde
haue ben ſhewed to my wyfe / that I had loſte
a hundred thouſande frankes / ſythe ye haue
ſworne / kepe your promeſſe / for what ſo euer
it coſte me I wyll knowe the trouth who hath
bewrayed our ſecretes.
            
               THus the Duke departed fro the
yonge lady / and made no ſēblant
as than / but pacyentely ſuffred / 
howe be it he thought the more.
and at nyght came to his wyfe to
ſupper / & ſhewed her more token of loue than
euer he dyd befor / and he dyd ſomoche with
fayre wordes that the ducheſſe ſhewed him all
the matter / and howe that ſhe knewe it by ſyr
Peter of Craon. than the duke ſpake no more
at that tyme. that nyght paſſed / and the nexte

day about nyne of the clocke / he toke his horſe
and rode fro the howſe of ſaynte Poll to the
caſtell of Lowre / where he founde the kynge
his brother heryng of maſſe. The kyng ſwetelye
receyued hym / for he loued hym entyerly / 
and the kynge ſawe well by the dukes maner
that he had ſome dyſpleaſure in his mynde / 
and ſaid. Ah fayre brother. what is the mater?
it ſemeth ye be troubled. Syr quod he good
cauſe why. Wherfore quod the kynge I praye
you ſhewe me. The duke who wolde hyde no
thynge fro the kynge / ſhewed hym all the hole
mater / and complayned greatly agaynſt ſyr
Peter of Craon / and ſayd. Syr by the faythe
that Iowe to god and to you / if it were nat for
your honoure I wolde ſlee hym. We ſhall do
well ynough quod the kynge / he ſhall be warned
by our counſayle to auoyde our houſe and
ſeruyce / and in lykewyſe cauſe him to auoyde
your houſe and company. I am well content
with this ꝙ the duke. The ſame day the lorde
de la Ryuer and ſir Iohan Mercyer ſayd vnto
ſyr Peter of Craon on the kynges behalfe / 
that he ſhulde auoyde the kynges courte and
ſeruyce / and go where he lyſte. In lykewyſe
ſyr Iohan of Buell and the lord of Dernaulx
ſeneſchall of Thourayne / gaue hym lyke commaundement / 
on the duke of Thourayns behalfe.
Whan ſyr Peter of Craon ſawe this he
was abaſſhed and tooke it in great dyſpyte / 
and coude nat ymagyn why it ſhulde be. And
trewe it was / he deſyred to come in to the kinges
preſence and the dukes / to know the cauſe
of their dyſpleaſure. But he was aunſwered
that nother the kynge nor the duke wolde nat
here hym ſpeke. Whan he ſawe none other remedy
he apparelled hym ſelfe / and departed
out of Parys in great diſpleaſure in his hert / 
and ſo rode into Aniou to a caſtell of his owne
called Sable / and taryed there a ſeaſon fore
troubled in his mynde. He ſawe well he was
chaſed out of the frenche courte / and out of the
houſe of Thourayn / and alſo out of the houſe
of the quene of Naples and Iheruſalem. than
whan he parceyued theſe thre howſes cloſed
fro hym / he thought to go to the duke of Bretaygne
his coſyn / and to ſhewe hym all his aduentures.
ſo he dyd / and rode in to Bretayne / 
and founde the duke at Wannes / who made
hym good chere / and knewe ſomwhat before
of his trouble. And than this ſyr Peter ſhewed
hym all the caſe. Whan the duke of Bretaygne
had well herde all the mater / he ſayde.
Fayre coſyn recomforte your ſelfe / all this is
ſurely brought aboute by ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon.
            THis rote and foundacyon of hatred
multyplyed greatly after / as ye ſhall
here in this hyſtory. Syr Peter of
Craon taryed ſo longe with the duke of Bretaygne / 
that he forgate Fraunce / for the conſtable
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon and the kynges
counſayle were agaynſte hym / and alſo they
were nat contente with the duke of Bretayne
in that he kepte ſir Peter Craon in his houſe.
As for the duke of Bretaygne cared nat greatly / 
neyther for the good wyll nor yuell wyll of
the Frenche kynge / he prouyded ſuffyciently
for his cyties / townes / and caſtelles / in ſuche
wyſe / that he loued as well warre as peace.
And all that euer he dyd was well knowen in
Fraunce / and with the kinges counſayle. and
ſuche as were nexte aboute the kynge reputed
the duke of Bretaygne prowde and preſumptuous / 
and thretened him greatly / but the duke
dyde ſette lytell therby / and ſayde / that he
wolde make warre agaynſt the erle of Pointhieur
in a iuſte quarell / for the erle of Pointhyeur
our coſyn / wryteth and nameth hym
ſelfe Iohan of Bretayne / as though he were
herytour of this countrey. I wyll he be called
Iohan / for that is his name and erle of Pointhieur / 
and I wyll he put out of his armes the
Ermyns / and write himſelfe Iohan of Bloys
or of Chatellon / and none other. and if he wyll
nat do thus I ſhall cauſe him to do it / and take
fro hym his lande / for he holdeth it by faythe
and homage of vs / as for the herytage of Bretaygne
he hathe nothynge to do therwith / ſo
that it ſhulde returne to him / for I haue bothe
ſonnes and doughters that ſhall be myne heyres.
Let hym purchaſe hym landes in ſome other
place / for as of this he hath fayled. Thus
often tymes the duke of Bretayne wolde deuyſe
with ſir Peter of Craon / who wolde nat
replye agaynſt his pleaſure / but rather dyd
further it / and all for the yuell wyll that
he bare to the conſtable ſyr Olyuer
of Clyſſon / and to
the counſayle
of
Fraunce.

               IT hath been ſhewed

whan̄e I ſpake of the alyaūce
and maryage of Lois
of Chatellon / ſonne to the
erle of Bloys / maryed to ye
lady Marye / doughter to
duke Iohan of Berrey / and at the confyrmacyon
of this maryage the duke of Berrey prouyded
greatly for his doughter / for ſhe was

the ſomme of ſyxe thouſande pounde money / 
corante in Fraunce / to be payed in florayns / 
if the foreſayd Loys of Bloys dyed before his

            ¶Of the ſodayne dethe of the Erle
Gaſcon of Foiz / and howe the erle of
Chaſtellon came to then herytaūce.
Cap. C.lxxx.
            
               THe ſame ſeaſone alſo
dyed the noble and gentle
erle of Foiz ryght marueylouſly / 
I ſhal ſhewe you by
what incydente. Truely of
all ſportes this Erle loued
hūtynge with houndes and
grey houndes / and of them he was well prouyded / 
for always he had at his cōmaundement
mo than .xvi. hundred. The erle as than was
at Barrey / in the marches of Orthays / and
wente dayly a huntynge in to the woodes of
Saluaterra / the way to Panpylona in Nauerre / 
and the ſame daye that he dyed he had
hunted and kylled a beare / and by that tyme
it was high noone. Than the erle demaunded
of them that were aboute hym where his dyner
was prouyded. It was ſhewed him at the
hoſpytall of Ryon / a two lytell myles fro Ortays / 
and ſo thyder he rode to dyner / and ſo a
lyghted there and went in to his chambre / the
whiche was ſtrawed with grene herbes / & the
walles ſette full of grene bowes / to make the
chambre more freſſh / for the ayre without was
marueylouſly hote as in the moneth of May.
Whan he felte that freſſhe ayre he ſayd. A this
freſſhneſſe dothe me moche good / for the daye
hath been very hoote / and ſo ſate downe in a
chayre. Than he talked and deuyſed with ſyr
Eſpayne du lyon of his houndes / whiche had
ronne beſt / and as he thus deuyſed / there cāe

in to the chambre ſir Ienbayne his baſtarde
ſonne and ſir Peter of Cabeſtan / and the tables
were redy couered in the ſame chambre.
Than water was brought forthe to waſſhe / 
and Coiandon of Spaygne toke aſyluer baſon
and ſir Tybaulte toke the towell. Than
the erle roſe & put out his handes to waſſhe / 
and as ſone as the colde water fell on his fyngars / 
he waxed pale in the face / and ſodainly
her herte fayled hym / and ſo fell downe / and
in the fallynge ſayd. Ah I am but deed. God
haue mercy on me: He neuer ſpake worde after / 
howe be it he dyed nat ſo ſoone / but laye
in great payne. The knyghtes that were about
hym were ſore abaſſhed and ſo was his
ſoone: They tooke hym in their armes and
layde hym on a bedde and couered hym / truſſtynge
that he was but in a traunce. The .ii.
knyghtes that had gyuen hym water / to the
entent that it ſhulde nat be ſayde that they
had enpoyſoned hym / toke the baſon and the
ewer and ſayde / Sirs / here in your preſence
beholde here this water / the whiche we toke
aſſaye of and yet wyll do. And there they drā
               ke
therof / ſo that euery man was cōtent with
them. They put in to the erles mouthe drinke
and ſpyces / and other thynges comfortable / 
but all that aueyled nothyng. For in leſſe
than halfe an houre he was deed / and yelded
vp his brethe ſwetely. God of his pytie haue
mercy on him. all ſuch as were there were
greatly troubled and abaſſhed. Than they
cloſed the Chambre doore / to the entent that
his dethe ſhulde nat be ſo ſodaynly knowen
abrode. The knightes behelde ſir Ienbayne
his ſonne / who wepte pituouſly and wrang
his hādes. And the knightes that were with
hym ſayde. Sir Ienbayne / ye haue nowe
loſte youre father: We knowe well he loued
you entierly. Leaue your ſorowe / and leape
on your horſe and ryde to Orthayes. Take
you poſſeſſyon of the caſtell and of your fathers
treaſoure that is within it / or euer the
dethe of your father be knowen abrode. Sir
Ienbayne enclyned to thoſe wordes & ſayd.
Sirs I thanke you of your good couuſaile
the whiche I ſhall deſerue. But than̄e lette
me haue ſome token that is on my father / or
elles I ſhall nat be ſuffred to entre in to the
caſtell. That is trewe ſir quod they / take ſōe
token fro your father. Than he toke a rynge
fro his fathers fynger / and a Knyfe that he
bare alwayes about hym. Theſe tokens the
porter of the caſtell knewe well: If he hadde
nat brought them / he ſhulde nat haue enered
in there.
            
               THus ſir Ienbayne of Foiz deꝑted
from the hoſpytall of Ryone
and thre with hym / and rode in
haſte to the caſtell of Orthayes.
He rode throughe the towne / no
man myſtruſted hym / and ſo came to the Caſtell
and called the Porter / who aunſwered
and ſayd. ſir / what wolde you haue? Where
is my lorde your Father? He is at the hoſpytall
of Ryon quod the knyght / and hath ſent
me for certayne thynges that is in his chambre:
and than I muſt returne agayne to him.
And to the entent that thou ſhuldeſt beleue
me / Beholde here his rynge and knyfe. The
porter opyned a wyndowe and ſawe the tokyns:
whiche he knewe well. Than the porter
opyned the wicket and he entred in / & his
varlettes dyd ſet vp his horſe. As ſoone as
he was entred he ſayde to the porter. Cloſe agayne
the gate. Than he toke the porter and
ſayd. Delyuer me the kayes / or els thou arte
but deed. The porter was abaſſhed & ſayde.
Sir / why ſay ye thus? Bycauſe quod he my
father is deed / and I wyll haue ye poſſeſſyon
of his treaſour / or any other come here. The
porter obeyed for he durſt do none otherwiſe
and he loued ſir Ienbayne as well as another.
The knyght knewe ryght well where
the treaſour laye / whiche was in a ſtronge
towre / wherto belonged thre ſtronge dores / 
ſurely bolted and barred / and dyuers kayes
parteynyng to them. Whiche kayes he coude
nat fynde redely / for they were in a cofer of
ſtele / and locked with a lytell kaye of Stele.
whiche kaye the erle euer bare on hym / wherſoeuer
he wente / in a lytell purſe aboute his
necke. Whiche (after ſir Ienbayne was departed
fro the hoſpytall) was founde by the
knightes that were about the deed corſe. thā
they marueyled what kaye it ſhulde be that
the erle bare ſo priuely about hym ſelfe. than
therles chapelayne called ſir Nicholas of Eſcall / 
who knewe all the erles ſecretes (for the
erle loued hym well / & euer whan he went in
to his treaſorie houſe / he had his chapelayne
with hym) ſayde / As ſoone as he ſawe the
kaye. Ah / ſir Ienbayne hath but loſt his payne / 

for this is the kaye of a lytell cofer wherin
are all the kayes of the Towre and cofer / 
wher all the Erles treaſour lyeth. Than the
knyghtes ſayde. Sir Nicholas. Go & ryde
you to Orthayes and beare hym the kaye.
Sirs quod he / ſythe ye gyue me the counſayle
I ſhall do it / for it were better he had
his fathers treaſoure than another: and alſo
I knowe well his father loued hym entierly
Than he tooke his horſe and tooke the kaye
and rode to the caſtell of Or
                  •
               hayes. And all
that ſeaſon ſir Ienbayne was ſertchynge all
aboute for they kayes / and coulde nat fynde
thē / nor wyſt nat howe to get the towre dore
opyn / it was ſo ſtronge: nor alſo he hadde no
inſtrumentes to breke it opyn with all. And
in this meane ſeaſon the men of the towne
hadde ſoone knowledge / by varlettes or women
that came / to the hoſpytall / howe therle
ſhulde be deed. Theſe were harde tidynges
to them / for the erle was welbeloued withall
his people. They of the towne aſſembled to
guyder in the markette place / and ſayde one
to another / ſuche as hadde ſene ſir Ienbayn
paſſe through the towne alone. We haue ſene
ſir Ienbayne paſſe through the towne alone
towardes the caſtell / & it ſemed by his councynaunce
he was nat content. Surely there
is ſome thyng a myſſe / ſor he was nat wonte
to cōe home before his father. Thus as they
were cōmunynge toguyder / there came in to
the towne the Erles chapelayne. Than̄e the
men of the towne came aboute hym and demaūded
newes of therle their lorde. It hath
been ſhewed vs that he is deed. Is it ſo or
nat? Nay quod the preeſt he is not deed / but
he is ſore ſicke / and I am come home before
to cauſe thynges to be dreſſed for hym / and
than I muſte retourne agayne to hym. And
ſo therwith he paſſed forth to the caſtell / and
dyde ſo moche that he entred / of whoſe commyng
ſir yuan had great ioye / For without
the kaye that he brought he coulde nat haue
entred in to the Towre where as the treaſour
was. Than the men of the towne hadde
great ſuſpecte of the Erles dethe and ſayde.
It is nere hande nyght / and as yet we here
nothynge of our lorde / nor of none of his offycers / 
and ſir yuan and his chapelayne are
entred in to the caſtell ſuſpeciouſly. Let vs
watche the caſtell this night / and to morowe
we ſhall here other tidynges. Lette vs ſende
ſecretely to ye hoſpitall / than ſhall we knowe
howe the mater gothe. Alſo we knowe well / 
the mooſt parte of the erles treaſour is with
in the Caſtell / and if it be ſtollen awaye by
crafte / we ſhalbe blamed for it. Ignoraunce
ſhall nat excuſe vs. They all thought it was
beſt for them ſo to do. Than̄e the men of the
towne drewe about the caſtell and kepte the
gates of the towne ſurely / that none ſhulde
entre nor iſſue without lycence. Thus they
watched all nyght / and in the mornyng they
had parfyte knowledge of the dethe of their
lorde. Than euery man / woman / and chylde
cryed out and wepte pituouſly / for the Erle
was welbeloued. Than the watchmen doubled
and encreaſed in harneſſe aboute the caſtell.
            
               WHan ſir yuan of Foize ſawe the
maner of the men of the towne / 
and ſawe well howe he was ꝑceyued / 
and that they knewe the
certayntie of the dethe of his father.
Than he ſayde to ſir Nycholas. Sir / 
I haue fayled of myne entēt / I ſe well I can
nat departe hens without lycence. The men
of the towne haue knowledge of my fathers
dethe / and they aſſemble in great nombre before
ye caſtell. It behoueth me to humble my
ſelfe to them / for force can nat aueyle me. ſir / 
ye ſaye trouthe quod the preeſt: ye ſhall wyn
more by ſwete and fayre word / than by rude
and frowarde dealynge. Go your waye and
ſpeke with them. Than ſir yuan went in to a
towre nere to the gate / & opyned a wyndowe
ouer the bridge / in the whiche towre he was
brought vp in / tyll he maryed the lady Iane
of Boloyne / who afterwarde was ducheſſe
of Berrey: as ye ſhall here after in this hyſtorie.
Sir yuan opyned the wyndowe and
ſpake to them that were the princypals of the
towne / who cāe on the bridge nere to the windowe / 
to here what he wolde ſaye. Than he
ſpake a loude and ſayde. O ye good people
of Orthays / I knowe well the cauſe of your
aſſēbly: it is nat wtout a great occaſion: how
be it I requyre you as derely as ye loued my
lorde & father / that ye be nat diſpleaſed with
me / thoughe I haue aduaunſed my ſelfe to
entre in to this caſtell firſt / or any other ſhude
entre / and to take poſſeſſion therof / and of

ſuche goodes as be within it / for I wyll do
nothyng but good. ye knowe well my lorde
my father loued me as well and entierly / as
his owne ſonne / and wolde fayne haue foūde
the wayes to haue made me his enherytour.
And nowe it hath pleaſed god to call hym to
his mercy / without accomplyſſhyng of any
thynge of myne aduauncement: And nowe
he hath lefte me amonge you / where I haue
been brought vp / and lefte nowe as a poore
knyght / baſtarde ſonne to the erle of Foize / 
without I haue your ayde and helpe. Wherfore
ſirs / I requyre you in goddes behalfe to
haue pytie on me / wherin ye ſhall do great
almeſſe. And I ſhall open the caſtell and ſuffre
you to entre / I wyll nat kepe it agaynſt
you. Than they aunſwered and ſayde. Sir
yuan / ye haue ſpoken ſo nobly / that it ought
to ſuffyce. And ſir / we ſaye that we wyll abide
with you / and our entent is to kepe this
caſtell and goodes with you. And if the Vicount
of Chaſtellon your coſyn / who is next
enherytoure to this countrey of Byerne / as
nexte parente to your father come hyder / to
challenge his herytage and mouables / or he
haue it / he ſhall knowe well howe we ſhall
defende you and your right / fro hym and fro
your brother ſir Gracyen. But we ſuppoſe / 
that whan̄e the Frenche kynge was laſte at
Tholous / and my lorde youre Father with
hym / that ſome order was takenne / as touchyng
your fathers enherytaunce: And this
can ſir Roger of Spaygne your coſyn tell / 
no man better than he. We ſhall write to him
and ſhewe hym of the dethe of the erle your
father / and deſyre hym to come hyder to helpe
and counſayle vs in all thynges / concernynge
the landes of Bierne and of Foiz / and
alſo for the mouables: and for thentierment
of my lorde youre father. And this we promyſe
you faythfully to vpholde. With this
aunſwere ſir yuan was well contente: And
thanne opyned the gate of the Caſtell of Orthayes / 
and ſuche entred as wolde: And the
ſame daye the Erles body was brought thyder.
At the metyng of the corſe / men and women
wepte pituouſly / in the remembraunce
of his nobleneſſe and puyſſaunt eſtate: His
wytte and prudence / his Proweſſe and largeſſe / 
and the great proſperyte that he lyued
in: For there was nouther Frenche nor Englyſſhe
that durſte dyſpleaſe hym. Mooſt
parte of the people ſayd. Nowe our neyghbours
wyll make vs war / where as we were
wonte to lyue in peace and fredome. Nowe
ſhall we be in bondage / in miſery / and ſubiectyon.
Nowe there is none to ayde vs.
            
               AH Gaſcone Gaſcone fayre ſon̄e.
Why dyde ye euer ſo dyſpleaſe
your father / yt it coſte you your
lyfe. If ye had ben lefte with vs
it ſhulde nowe haue ben to vs a
great cōforte but we loſt you to yong / & your
father hath taryed to ſhort a ſeaſon with vs.
He was but threſcore and thre yeres of age.
He myght haue lyued for any age / many a
yere lengar. It was no great age for ſuche a
prince / hauynge euery thyng at his eaſe and
wyſſhe. Ah thou lande of Bierne / deſtytute
and without conforte of any noble herytour.
What ſhall become of the? Thou ſhalte neuer
haue agayne ſuche another / as was this
gentyll erle of Foiz. With ſuche lamentacions
and wepynges / the body of this Noble
Erle was borne throughe the towne of Orthayes / 
by eight noble knyghtes. The firſt
the Vycounte of Brunyquell / and agaynſt
hym the lorde of Compayne. The thirde ſir
Roger of Spaygne / and agaynſt hym ſir
Raymonde of Layſne. The fyfthe ſir Raymonde
de la Mote / agaynſt hym the lorde of
Beſache. The ſeuenthe ſir Menault of Noualles / 
and agaynſt hym Rycharde of ſaynt
George. And behynde was ſir yuan his baſtarde
ſonne. The lorde of Coraſe. The lorde
of Barantyne. The lorde of Baruge. the
lorde of Quere / and mo than threſcore other
knyghtes of Byerne / who were ſoone come
to the hoſpytall of Ryone / whan they knewe
of the Erles dethe. Thus he was caryed wt
open vyſage to the freers in Orthayes / and
there he was enbaumed and layde in leed / &
ſo lefte vnder good kepynge / vnto the day of
entierment. And nyght and daye withoute
ceaſe / there was brinnynge aboute his body / 
four and twentie torches borne by eight
and fourtie yomen. Foure
and twentie in the
nyght / and
foure
and twentie in the
daye.

THe dethe of this noble erle of Foiz / 
was anone knowen in dyuers countreis / 
& mo were rather ſorie of his
dethe than gladde / for he had in his dayes giuen
ſuche gyftes / ſo liberally / that it coulde
nat be eſchewed: wherfore he was be loued
of euery man that knewe hym. Pope Clement
whan he knewe of his dethe was right
ſoroufull for hym bicauſe he had taken great
payne in fortherynge of the maryage / of his
coſyn Iane of Boloygne / who was ducheſſe
of Berrey. The ſame ſeaſon there was at
Auignon the byſſhop of Palmes / who durſt
nat com at his benifyce for a diſpleaſure that
the erle of Foize had to hym / and yet he was
of his lynage. The cauſe was / the byſſhopp̄
wolde haue exalted his iuriſdiction and abated
therles / for all that therle made hym byſſhop.
Than the pope ſente for the byſſhoppe
to come to his palais / and whan he was cōe
the pope ſayde. Sir byſſhoppe of Palmes / 
your peace is made / the erle of Foiz is deed.
Of thoſe tidynges the byſſhoppe was glad / 
and within a ſhorte ſeaſon after he departed
fro Auignon / and wente to his byſſhoprike
in to the countrey of Foize. Tidynges of the
dethe of this erle was anone come into Fraū
               ce
to the kynge / and to his counſayle. The
Frenche kyng and his brother / and the duke
of Burbone were ſorie of his dethe / bycauſe
of his nobleneſſe. Than the counſayle ſaide
to the kyng. Sir / the coūtie of Foiz is yours
by right ſucceſſyon / ſeyng the erle of Foiz is
deed without heyre of his body laufully begotten / 
no man canne debate with you therin.
Alſo they of the countie thynke the ſame.
And ſir / there is one thyng that helpeth gretlye
your tytell / ye haue lende there on fyftie
thouſande frankes. Sir / ſende and take poſſeſſyon
of your guage / and kepe it as youre
owne enherytaūce. For they of the ſame coū
               trey
deſyre to be vnder youre hande. It is a
fayre countre and ſhall come to you to good
purpoſe / for it marcheth nere to the Realme
of Arragone / and alſo to Chattelone. And
paraduenture here after ye may happe to haue
warre with the kyng of Arragon. Than
the countie of Foiz ſhalbe a good fronter / for
therin be many fayre and ſtronge caſtelles to
kepe in men of warre / and to make good garyſons.
The kyng herde well thoſe wordes / 
and anone enclyned to their counſayle / and
ſayde. Sirs / lette ſe / whome ſhall we ſende
on this meſſage. Than̄e it was determyned
to ſende ye lorde de la Ryuer / bycauſe he was
knowen in that countrey / and with hym the
byſſhoppe of Noyon. Theſe two lordes prepared
them ſelfe to go on this legacyon. and
whan̄e they departed they rode at leyſar by
ſmall iourneys / and toke their waye by Auignon.
            IN this meane ſeaſon worde was ſente
to the Vicount of Chaſtellon / beyng in
the realme of Arragon / of the dethe of his coſyn
the erle of Foiz. Than he rode tyll he cāe
in to Bierne / ſtreyght to Orthays. They of
the towne made hym good chere / howe be it
they toke him nat as than for their lorde / and
ſaide / howe all the countrey was nat aſſembled / 
and that firſt they muſt aſſemble toguyder
the prelates / lordes / and men of the good
Townes / and to counſayle toguyder what
they ſhulde do. Sayeng: that is a good coū
               trey
that holdeth of hym ſelfe / and the lordes
that dwelleth therin / and hath herytages to
be free. Than̄e it was aduyſed for the beſt.
Firſt to make the entierment of the erle Gaſcone
of Foiz at Orthays / and to ſende for all
the nobles of Bierne and of Foize / ſuche as
wolde come / and than to take counſayle whō
they ſhulde accepte for their lorde. Than all
barones and prelates / and heedes of good
townes of Bierne and of Foiz were ſent for.
They of Bierne cāe thyder / but they of Foiz
refuſed to come there and ſayde / they wolde
kepe their countrey. For they herde ſaye the
Frenche kyng wolde ſende thyder to chalēge
they countre of Foiz. Howe be it the byſſhop
of Palmes was deſyred to come to Orthais / 
bycauſe of lynage / and ſo he came thyder in
good array / as to hym apparteyned.
            The day of the obſequy of the gentyll erle
Gaſcon of foiz / laſt erle of that name / done in
the freres in the towne of Orthays / the yere
of our lorde god / a thouſande thre hundred
fourſcore and a .xi. on a monday. There was
moche people of the countrey of Bierne and
of other places / bothe lordes / knightes / and
other prelates. There were four biſſhoppes
the byſſhop of Palmes who ſayd the maſſe / 
and the byſſhoppes / of Ayre / of Auron / and
of Tenues in Bierne. There was a goodly

herſe and well ordred. And duryng the maſſe
tyme / there was holden before the aulter by
four knightes foure baners / with the armes
of Foiz & of Bierne. The firſt helde ſir Raymon
of Newcaſtell. The ſeconde ſir Eſpaygne
du Lyon. The thirde ſir Peter deguier.
The fourthe ſir Menaulte of Noualles. ſir
Roger of Spaygne offred the ſworde / bytwene
the Bourge of Campaigne and Pier
of Arnaulte of Bierne / capitayne of Lourde.
The ſhelde bare the Vicount of Bruniquell
bytwene ſir Iohan of Newcaſtell and Iohn̄
of Chanteron. The helme offred the lorde of
Valētyne and of Bierne / bytwene Arnalton
of Roſtem and Arnalton of ſaynt Colombe.
The horſe was offred by the lorde of Coraſe / 
bytwene Arnalton of Spayne and Raymonet
of Campaygne. This entierment was
honorably done / accordyng to the vſage of ye
countre: and there were the two baſtarde ſō
               nes
of the erle of Foiz / ſir yua
                  •
                and ſir Gracien / 
and the Vicount of Chaſtel
                  •
               on / and all
the barons of Bierne and ſome of Foiz. But
aſſone as the ſeruyce was done / they of Foiz
departed and rode the ſame daye to dyner to
Herytell / two myles fro Orthais. and ye next
day be tymes the byſſhoppe of Palmes deꝑted / 
he wolde nat be at the generall ꝑlyament
whiche was the ſame daye a monge them of
Bierne. Thus the erle was buryed in ye freers
before the hyghe aulter. So there is no
more mencion made of hym / god haue mercy
vpon his ſoule. ¶Nowe let vs ſpeke of the
order that was taken at Orthais.
            AS it was enformed me / it was ſaid
to the Vycount of Chatelion. Sir / 
we knowe well that as next of blode
ye ought to ſuccede in the herytagꝭ / as well
of Bierne as of Foiz: But as nowe we can
nat receyue you as oure lorde / for therby we
myght bring the lande of Bierne in to great
trouble / warre / and daunger. For as we do
vnderſtande / the Frenche kynge who is our
good neighbour dothe ſēde hyder of his coū
               ſayle / 
we knowe nat for what entent / tyll we
here them ſpeke. We knowe well & ſo do you
that our lorde the erle / whome god pardone / 
was this laſt yere at Tholous with the frenche
kyng / and had ſecrete cōmunycacion toguyder / 
the whiche firſte hath nede to be declared / 
for if he haue gyuen and releaſed to
the Frēche kyng Foiz and Bietne / the kyng
than with puiſſance wyll haue & optayne it.
Wherfore or we do any thing we wyll know
the artycles / for we of Byern be in other caſe
& of other cōdycion than they of Foiz. We be
all fre without homage or ſeruytude / and the
countie of Foiz is holden of the Frenche kynge:
and alſo the people of Foiz their hertes
be ſo Frenche / that lightly they wyll receyue
the frenche kyng to their lorde and ſoucraygne:
For they haue ſayde ſithe the erle was
deed / he hath none heritour of his body laufully
gotten. Wherfore the countie of Foize
they ſaye / ſhulde parteyne to the ordynaūca
of the Frenche kyng. But ſir we ſhall kepe
our holde / and we wyll ſerue no lorde but ſuche
as we ought to do / wheder it be the frēch
kyng or you. But ſir / we wyll counſaile you
to worke wyſely in this buſyneſſe / by treatie
or otherwyſe. Than the Vycount ſaid. ſirs / 
by what meanes wyll ye coūſayle me to worke / 
for I haue promiſed to worke by your aduyſe
in euery thyng / accordyng to reaſon. ſir
quod they / we wyll aduyſe you to deſyre ſir
Roger of Spaygne your coſyn to kepe you
company / at your coſt and charge. And go in
to the countie of Foiz and treate with the prelates
and noble men / and with theym of the
good townes / that they wolde receyue you
to their lorde / or elles to ſytte ſtyll and diſſymule
the mater tyll ye haue apeaſed ye french
kyng / and taken with hym ſome cōpoſicion / 
by meanes of golde and ſiluer / that ye might
haue the enheritaunce in reſt and peace. if ye
do thus than do ye wiſely / and if ye maye be
herde with them that be ſente fro the Frenche
kynge in to the countie of Foize / thoughe it
coſt you a hundred thouſande or two hūdred
thouſande frankes / ye ſhall fynde ynoughe
to paye it with all / For the erle that is deed / 
hath lefte ynoughe behynde hym. Howe beit
ſir / in any wyſe we wyll that his two baſtarde
ſonnes haue parte largely of his goodes.
Than the lorde anſwered and ſayde. Sirs / 
I am content as ye wyll. And here is my coſyn
ſir Roger of Spaygne / and in all youre
preſences / I deſyre hym to ryde with me in
this iourney. Than ſir Roger anſwered and
ſaid. Sir / I am content to ryde with you to
be as meane bytwene bothe ꝑties. But if the
Frenche kyng my ſouerayne lorde or his ambaſſadours
deſyre me to be of their coūſayle / 

orels cōmaūde me nat to medell / than I muſt
nedes leaue you. The Vycount was content
and ſaide. Coſyn / I truſt they wyll nat agaynſt
your will take you fro me. and if I may
haue you nere me / I thynke to make a good
ende of all my buſyneſſe.
            THan (as I was enformed) the Vycount
of Chaſtellon made a requeſt
before thē all / to borowe fyue or .vi.
thouſande frankes to performe his iourney.
Alſo the two baſtardes made their requeſt / 
that they might haue parte of their fathers
richeſſe. Than the coūſayle toke aduiſe togider / 
& at laſt acorded that the Vicoūt ſhulde
haue fyue thouſande frankes: And the two
baſtardes of Foiz eche of them two thouſāde
frankes and incōtynent the tre
                  •
               ourers were
cōmaunded to delyuer the money. All offycers
that were in the Erles dayes / were ſuffred
to occupy ſtyll without any chaungyng
and than kepers were ſette to kepe the caſtell
of Orthais / and the richeſſe that was within
it. The Vicount at his firſt cōmynge to Orthais / 
gaue pardon to all the priſoners with
in the caſtell / wherof there were a great nombre.
For the erle of Foiz was a cruell man &
wolde ſpare no man / but to punyſſhe at his
pleaſure / though he were neuer ſo great a ꝑſonage.
He had ones in priſone the ſaid Vycount
of Chaſtellon in the botome of a dongion / 
eight monethes / for all that he was his
coſyn germayne. And whan̄c he delyuered
him / he ſette hym to raūſome at .xl. thouſāde
frankes / whiche was truly payde. And alſo
as longe as he lyued he loued hym neuer after / 
ſo that the Vicount durſt neuer come in
his ſight / for if the erle had lyued two yeres
lengar / the Vicount ſhulde neuer haue had
any parte of ye heritage of Foiz or of Bierne.
            THus this counſayle at Orthays brake
vp / and euery man departed and
lefte the Vycount to prepare for his
iourney / who made hym redy as ſoone as he
might / and deſyred certayne knightes & ſquiers
to go with hym. Thus he departed fro
Orthais with a two hundred horſe / and rode
to Moriens a good towne on the fronter / bytwene
Byerne and Bygore / a four myles fro
Pauy and a ſixe myle fro Tarbe. And the ſeconde
day he rode to ſaynt Gauſens / another
good towne at the entre of the coūtie of Foiz
on the ryuer of Garone. and there tidynges
came to hym howe the byſſhoppe of Noyon / 
and ſir Buryaulx de la Ryuer and other of ye
Frenche kynges counſayle were cōe to Tholous.
Than the Vycount tooke counſayle of
ſir Roger of Spayne what was beſt for him
to do: ſir Roger anſwered and ſayd. Sithe
we haue herde tidynges of them / let vs tary
here and ſe what they wyll do. I thynke they
wyll ſende ſhortely to vs: and ſo there they
taryed / for in dede they coulde go no further
in to the countie of Foiz / for all the good townes / 
caſtelles and paſſages were cloſed agaynſt
them: As Calumuche / Caſteres / Moūtteſquen / 
Carthas / Ortyngas / Foſſat / the cytie
of Palmes & the caſtell / Montaunt / and
all the caſtels on the fronter of Aragon. they
of the countie of Foiz ſayd / that no ſtraūger
with any puiſſaunce ſhulde entre in to no caſtell
nor towne of their countrey / tyll the mater
were determyned. and as they of the countrey
ſhewed themſelfe they were better mynded
to be Frenche / & to be gouerned by a ſeneſchall
(as the countre and cytie of Tholous
was / and Carcaſſon and Beauuoyre) rather
than to be vnder any other ruler. Howe be it
the mater went otherwyſe / as ye ſhall here.
For whan the Frenche kynges cōmyſſaries
were come to Tholous they demaunded newes
of the archebyſſhoppe / and of the ſeneſchall
of Foiz and of Bierne / and of other / ſuche
as had ben at Orthays at the buryeng of
the erle of Foiz. There they were enformed
in what caſe the countre ſtode in. Than they
toke aduyſe togyder / & determyned to ſende
for ſir Roger of Spaygne / bycauſe he was
the Frenche kynges man by faythe and homage / 
and his oftycer / as ſeneſchall of Carcaſſone.
They ſent a credable perſone with a
letter to hym. The meſſanger rode to ſaynt
Gauſens / a .xii. myle fro thens. Than he delyuered
to ſir Roger of Spaygne his letter / 
ſir Roger toke & reed it / and ſayd to ye ſquyer
Sir / ye ſhall tary here all this day & to morowe
ye ſhall departe / I thynke ye ſhall nat
go without company. Than ſir Roger and
the Vycount counſayled toguyder. Than it
was thought for the beſte that ſir Roger of
Spayne ſhulde ryde to Tholous and ſpeke
there with the byſſhop of Noyon and with
the Lorde de la Ryuer / to knowe what they

wolde ſay. The next day 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Roger of Spayne
and the meſſanger rode forthe togyder / and
came y• ſame nyght to Tholouſe. Syr Roger
toke vp his lodgyng / and the meſſanger went
to his mayſters. Than the cōmyſſioners ſaid
to morowe we ſhall here tydynges / ſeynge ſir
Roger is come. The next day after maſſe ſyr
Roger drewe to the byſſhop and to the lorde
de la Ryuer / & made good chere eche to other / 
bycauſe they were all of aquayntaunce / and
there communed the cauſe of their cōmynge.
Than the kinges cōmyſſyoners ſhewed forth
the kinges procuracions / and howe they were
ſet and ſtablyſſhed to take poſſeſſyon and ſeaſon
of the countie of Foiz. and whan ſyr Roger
had well herde them at length / he replyed
with ſwete wordes and ſayde. Lordes I am
nat ſo nere of ye kinges coūſayle as ye be / and
if I were ſauynge your correction / I wolde
counſayle the kyng that he ſhulde take agayn
his money / and ſomwhat more (trewe it is he
hath lente money on the herytage of Foize / to
be reyſed after the dethe of the erle) yet let the
kynge leaue the ryght of the enherytaunce to
the nexte enherytoure of the blode / this ſhall
be for the kynges profyte / honour / and ſaluacyon / 
and in this that I ſaye / I ſhall laye dyuers
reaſons / if ye wyll here it. There is one
thynge whiche is clere / the erle of Foiz layde
his lande to pledge by fraude / for as for golde
and ſyluer he had ynough / for that he dyd was
for nothynge but to dyſheryte the Vicount of
Chaſtellon wrōgfully / bycauſe he hated hym
without cauſe. Alſo as touchyng the kynges
profyte / I enſure you the kepyng of the lande
of Foize ſhulde coſte the kynge more than the
rentes or reuenues cometh vnto. And thyrdly
the kyng ſhall leſe therby the homage and ſeruyce
of ſuche a man as is able to do him good
ſeruyce / this ought to be well regarded. alſo it
ſhulde be a great charge to the kynges conſyence
to dyſheryte any perſone / without a reaſonable
cauſe / for if the herytage of Foiz ſhuld
haue ben bought and ſolde / fyrſte all ſuche as
claymeth any ryght therin ſhulde haue ben a
greed with all and ſatyfyed / whiche was nat
ſo. wherfore my lordes theſe reaſons well conſydred / 
ſeynge ye be great wyſe men and counſaylours
to the kynge / take good hede what
ye do / or ye pronounce any thynge that ſhulde
tourne to the kinges ſclaunder / or hurte to his
conſcyence / if ye do otherwyſe it were great
ſynne / and as yet there is tyme ſuffycyente to
fynde remedy. My coſyn the Vicount of Chaſtellon / 
hathe ſente me hyther to you / to ſhewe
you this mater / and ryght effectuouſly deſyreth
you / and ſo do I in his name / to take regarde
in this behalfe. It is nat good nor conuenyent
a man to take euery thynge byforce / 
that he maye take. Whan he had ſayde / than
the byſſhoppe and the lorde de la Ryuer loked
on eche other / at laſte the byſſhop ſayde. Syr
Rodger / we ſe and knowe well that all that ye
haue ſayd is for good entente / but our cōmyſſyon
ſtretcheth nat ſo farre to quyte the bargayne
that was bytwene the kyng and therle
of Foize / howe be it for the loue of you / and to
bringe the matter ſomwhat to good purpoſe / 
and that all partyes myght be cōtent / we ſhall
put this mater in ſuffraunce / and ye ſhall take
the pay
                  •
               e to ryde with vs into Fraunce to the
kynge and to his counſayle / and than ſhewe
there your reaſons as ye ſhall thinke beſt / and
if by your meanes ye can cauſe the vycount of
Chaſtellon to enioy the herytage of Foiz / who
is enherytoure therto / as ye ſaye / we ſhall be
ryght gladde therof / for we wyll dyſheryte no
perſon. Syrs quod ſyr Roger I am well contente
with your ſayenge / if it pleaſe you to abyde
here a ſeaſon / your coſtes ſhall be borne
of the good that is in the caſtell of Orthays.
            THe thyrde day ſir Roger of Spayne
tooke leaue of the kynges cōmyſſyoners
and ſayde. Syrs / I thynke to
bringe this mater to a good purpoſe / I muſt
be fayne to make a iourney into Fraunce / if I
tary longe I pray you be nat myſcontent / for
it ſhall nat be in my faulte / and I ſhall ſende
you daily meſſangers and letters. Thus they
departed / they taryed at Tholous / and ſir Roger
rode to ſaynt Gauſens to the Vycount of
Chaſtellon / and ſhewed him all the mater. the
Vycount was ioyfull of thoſe tydynges and
ſayd. Fayre coſyn ſyr Roger / all my truſt is in
you the mater toucheth me nere it is for thenherytaunce
wherof I beare the armes / I can
nat tell whome to ſende in to Fraunce / but all
onely you to ſhewe my tytle to the kynge and
to his coūſayle / wherfore ſir for the loue of me / 
and for that I may deſerue to you in tyme to
come / take on you the charge of this voyage:
ſyr Rodger ſayd. Syr for the loue of you and
of your lynage I ſhall do it. Than ſir Roger

prepared for his iourney to ryde in to Fraūce
and ſo toke the way to Rodes / and the ſhorter
way / for as than truce was bytwene Fraunce
and Englande / or els the way that he toke had
nat been ſure for hym / for on the fronters of
Rouuergue / Quercy / & Lymoſyn / there were
many fortreſſes that made warre for the Englyſſhemen.
¶Nowe I wyll leaue for a ſeaſon
ſpekynge of ſyr Roger of Spayne / and
ſpeke of the frenche kynge / and of the duke of

            ¶How the treatie of peace renewed
at Towers in Thourayn / bytwene
the Frenche kynge and the duke of
Bretayne and of the mariage of the
doughter of Fraunce to the lonne of
Bretayne / and of Iohn̄ of Bretayne
erle of Pointhieur and the doughter
of the duke of Bretaygne.
Cap. C.lxxxi.
            
               YE haue herde here before
in dyuers places in this hyſtory / 
howe the duke of Bretayne and
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / as than
conſtable of Fraunce / hated mortally
eche other / and beſyde the hatred that the
duke had to ſyr Olyuer / he had gret enuy that
he was ſo great with the kinge / and ſo ſecrete
of his counſayle / and gladly he wolde haue
troubled hym / but he doughted ye kynges diſpleaſure / 
and often tymes the duke repented
hym that he had nat ſlayne hym whan he had
hym in priſone in the caſtell of Ermyn / for he
thought if he had ſlayne hym / than he ſhulde
neuer haue had more trouble by hym. The yuell
wyll that he had to hym cauſed hym to be
harde mynded to be obedyente to the crowne
of Fraunce / howe be it he knewe well he dyd
yuell / therfore he ſuffred all thynge to paſſe at
aduenture / and helde in his loue the englyſſhe
men / and prouyded ſuffycyently his townes
and fortreſſes with artyllery & vytayles / and
ſent priuely in to Englande for men of armes
and archers / & dyd ſet them in his garyſons / 
and made to be beleued that he loked to haue
warre but his men kn
                  •
               we nat with whome / 
howe be it all that euer he dyd was knowen in
Fraūce / and many ſpake largely againſt him.
He knewe well that certrayne lordes of Fraunce
were nat contente with hym / but he dyd ſet lytell
therby / but ſo paſſed on his tyme. He had
great affyaunce in his coſyne the ducheſſe of
Burgoyne / as it was reaſon / for he had of her
a ſpecyall ſupporte and ayde / for the lady bycauſe
of lygnage loued hym / and bycauſe that
the erle of Flaunders her father / who was coſyn
germayne to the duke had alwayes loued
and comforted hym in all his trybulacyons.
This lady of Burgoyne was a good lady / ſo
that the duke her huſbande wolde nat gladly
diſpleaſe her / and good cauſe why / for ye duke
by her helde great herytages / and had by her
fayre chyldren. all the realme of Fraunce was
bounde to loue her / and ſhe had nat ben / great
dyſcenſions had moued bytwene the parties / 
for natwithſtandynge that the duke of Bretayne
had ben at Paris with the french kyng / 
and made to hym homage / yet I can nat well
ſay if it was with good herte or no / for as ſone
as the duke was retourned in to Bretaygne / 
there apered in hym but ſmall amendemente / 
he had ſworne obeyſaunce and to be obedyent
to the pope at Auignon / but he was nat / for rather
he diſpyſed hym in his wordes. Nor alſo
he wolde ſuffre no man to be promoted in his
countrey by that popes bulles / but helde hym
ſelfe newter in dyuers thynges / & wolde gyue
the benefyces hym ſelfe. No clerke coulde atteygne
to any promocyon of any benefyce in
his countrey / without he had ben well pleaſed
therwith. Alſo any cōmaūdements that came
out of the parlyament chambre of Parys / he
ſette nothynge therby. The prelates and byſſhoppes
of Bretayne loſt great parte of their
iuriſdictions by this duke / ſo that great complayntes
therof was made in the parlyament
of Parys / but they hadde ſmall remedy. And
whan he was ſent for to come to Parysꝭ or els
to ſende thyder ſome able perſonages to make
aunſwere to ſuche matters as ſhulde be aledged
agaynſte hym / and whan any of the kynges
offycers came in to Bretaygne to ſomon
hym to apere / thanne he wolde nat be ſpoken
withall / but euer made ſondry ſeues. And
whan the kinges officers dyd departe againe
thens / than he wolde ſay. I wyll go to Parys
to ſe what ryght I ſhall haue there. It is nat

yet thre yeres ſence I was there / to ſe what
ryght I ſhulde haue / but I coulde ſe nor here
of no ryght there mynyſtred / the lordes of the
parlyament tourne euery thynge as they lyſt.
They reken me very yonge and ignorante / to
be ledde as they lyſt / but I wolde they knewe
that if all my men of the duchy of Bretaygne / 
were all of one accorde / and obedyent to my
pleaſure / as they ought to be / I wolde gyue
the realme of Fraunce ſo moche to do / that I
wolde bringe theym that be vnreaſonable to
reaſon / and ſuche as hath done trewly ſhulde
be rewarded acordyngly / and ſuche as haue
deſerued to haue iuſtyce / ſhulde haue as they
haue deſerued / and ſuche as wolde haue right
ſhuld haue it. Thus many complayntes were
made often tymes to the kynge / and ſuche as
were of his ſecrete counſayle ſaid. This duke
is ryght preſumptuous and proude / ſythe he
wyll be brought to no reaſon / and if he ſhulde
be thus ſuffred in his lewde opinyon / it ſhulde
greatly enfeble the nobleneſſe of this realme / 
for by hym other lordes ſhall take enſample to
do yuell / and therby the iuryſdictyon of the
realme lytell and lytell ſhall be loſte. Than it
was deuyſed to withſtande / and to fynde remedy
for ſuche inconuenyentes / and to ſende
ſwetely to hym to come to Towrs in Thourayne / 
and there to mete with the french kyng
and with the duke of Berrey / and the duke of
Burgoyne / the byſſhop of Charters / the byſſhoppe
of Dothune. Theſe four were ſpecyally
named / bycauſe the duke loued them beſt
aboue all other lordes of Fraunce / excepte the
erle of Eſtampes / and the lorde Coucy.
            THus there was ſente in to Bretayne
to the duke the erle of Eſtampes and
mayſter Iue of Noyent. They toke
great payne and traueyle to moue the duke
to mete with the frenche kynge at Towrs. they
ſpake ſo fayre with freſſhe coloured wordes / 
armed with reaſon / that the duke agreed to
go to Towrs / but further he ſayd in no wyſe
he wolde go / and alſo that he ſhulde nat ſe his
enemy ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon in no wyſe. All
this was acorded & agreed / or he wolde come
to Towrs. Theſe ambaſſadours retourned
in to Fraunce and ſhewed the kynge and his
counſayle howe they had ſpedde. They were
contente therwith / ſythe they coulde brynge
hym to none other purpoſe. The kynge and
his coūſayle made them redy to go to Towrs
and to tary there a two or thre monethes / for
they thought their treatie with ye duke of Bretayne
ſhulde nat ſone be acompliſſhed. Thus
the frenche kinge / the duke of Thourayne his
brother / the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne / 
and Iohan of Burgoyne his ſonne / the duke
of Burbon / the lorde Coucy / the erle of Marche / 
the Erle of ſaynte Poll / and other of the
counſaile of Fraūce came to Towrs in Thourayn.
Alſo thyder came the conſtable of Fraū
               ce
and Iohan of Bretayne his ſonne in lawe / 
and their counſayles / for they hadde maters
there to do. And a fyftene dayes after / thyder
came the duke of Bretayne. or he came it was
ſayd he wolde nat come / for he had thre tymes
ſent to excuſe hym ſelfe / ſayenge he was ſpeke
and coude nat ryde / how be it finally he came / 
and was lodged at his eaſe. There was ſyr
Roger of Spaygne to haue ben aunſwered / 
but the kynge and the counſayle had ſomoche
to do with the duke of Bretayns maters / that
they coulde entende to nothyng els. This ſyr
Roger was there more than two monethes or
he coulde be aunſwered / but daily he was anſwered
yt he ſhulde be herde / but it was longe
fyrſte. Alſo the ſame tyme there fell another
let / for thyder came fro kyng Rycharde of Englande
ſyr Iohan Clapam / one of the kynges
counſayle and of his chaumbre / and Rycharde
Choall clerke and doctour of lawe / to
ſpeke with the Frenche kynge and his counſayle / 
for the ſame matter that ſyr Thomas
Percy and the lorde Clyfforde had ben at Parys
for with the kynge. Whan the englyſſhe
men were come to Towrs / all other treaties
were cloſed vp and entended to their delyueraunce.
It was ſhewed me that they brought
letters of credence to the kynge and to the dukes
of Berrey & Burgoyne. they were herde.
Their credence was / that the kynge of Englande
and his Vncles wolde knowe if the
frenche kynge and his counſayle were in wyll
and mynde to kepe their metyng at Amyence
to treate for a peace to be had bytwene the two
kynges / their alyes and confederates. The
frenche fynge (who as he ſhewed / deſyred no
thynge ſo moche as peace / and anſwered and
ſaid / that he was redy to accomplyſſhe all promeſſes / 
ſayenge that as ſoone as he had delyuered
the duke of Bretayne and were departed
fro Towrs / he wolde entende to nothynge

e
                  •
               s / tyll he were come to Amyence / and there to
abyde for the englyſſhe ambaſſadours / and
there to make them as good chere as he coude.
Here with the englyſſhe ambaſſadours were
well cōtent / and were a fyue dayes at Towrs
with the kynge / and than tooke their leaue of
the kynge and of the other lordes. The kynge
gaue them great gyftes and their coſtes there
payed for / and ſo departed. and all that ſeaſon
they ſawe nat the duke of Bretayne nor ſpake
nat with hym / for the duke welde nat / leſte the
frenche men ſhulde haue any ſuſpecte in hym.
Thus the englyſſhmen retourned to Calays
and ſo to Douer / and to London and founde
the kynge and his counſayle at Weſtmynſter / 
and there ſhewed what they had done / herde / 
and ſene. The anſwere that they brought pleaſed
well the kynge and his counſayle / and ordeyned
for their iourney to go to Amyence.
            ¶Nowe let vs ſom what ſpeke of the meſſangers
that were ſente to the frenche kynge / fro
the Vycount of Chaſtellon / out of Foize and
Bierne.
            SIr Roger of Spayne & ſir Eſpaygne
du Lyon / who were ſent in to Fraunce
fro the Vicounte of Chaſtellen / they toke on
theym great payne and traueyle to purſewe
their cauſe / for certayne clerkes and knightes
of the kinges counſayle / aduyſed the kynge to
take the countie of Foiz / and to attrybute it to
the crowne of Fraunce / ſythe they of the countrey
wolde agree therto. The kynge enclyned
well therto / but the duke of Burgoyne who
was ſage and ymagynatyue wolde nat agree
therto / but ſayd alwayes. Let the kynge take
agayn his money / and ſomwhat more. Howe
be it as it was ſhewed me the duke of Burgoyne
coulde nat be herde. But the duke of
Berrey toke the buſyneſſe him / by meanes
as I ſhall ſhewe you. ye haue herde here before
what fell bytwene hym and the olde Gaſcon
erle of Foize / whan the duke ſente in to
Bierne to the erle ſuche notable perſones / as
was the erle of Sanxete / the vicount Daſſey
the lorde de la Ryuer / and ſyr Wyllm̄ of Tremoyle / 
to treate for the maryage of the lady
Iahan of Boloyne / whome the erle of Foize
had in kepinge / and at that tyme the erle was
well content with the maryage that ye duke of
Berrey ſhulde haue her / ſo that he wolde pay
thyrty thouſande frankes for the kepyng and
bringynge vp of the lady / and the duke payed
the ſaid ſome / and ſo had the lady to his wyfe.
The duke of Berrey remembred the mater
than / and ſente for ſyr Roger of Spayne and
for ſyr Eſpayne du Lyon / to come ſpeke with
hym in his chambre / and ſo ſecretly he ſayde
to them. Syrs if ye wyll come to a good concluſyon
in your ſute. ye ſhall attayne therto by
my meanes / but fyrſt I wyll haue agayne the
thyrty thouſande frankes / whiche I payed to
the olde erle of Foiz whan I had my wyfe. I
haue alwayes ymagyned that if I myght ouer
lyue the erle of Foiz to haue the money agayne.
Whan theſe two knyghtes herde the
duke ſay ſo / they regarded eche other & ſpake
neuer a worde. Than the duke ſayd agayne.
Syrs to ſay trouthe I haue taken your wordes
fro you / ſpeke togyther and aduyſe you
well / without this treatie ye ſhall nat attayne
to your purpoſe / for my brother of Burgoyne
wyll do as I wyll haue hym / he hath the gouernaunce
of the countrey of Picardy / and I
of Languedocke / agaynſte my wyll no man
wyll ſpeke. The Vycount of Chaſtellon ſhall
fynde good ynough / for the erle that is deed
had more rycheſſe than the kynge hath in his
treaſour. Than ſyr Roger of Spayne ſayde.
ſir though we wolde agre to your demaunde / 
yet we haue nat here with vs the treaſure to
contente you withall. Ah ſyr Roger quod the
duke / that ſhall nat let nor hyndre the mater / 
and ye promyſe the dette on your faythe and
writynge I wyll beleue you / and if it were in
a greater mater than that is. Syr quod the
knyght I thanke you / we ſhall ſheke togyder
and to more we gyue you an anſwere. It pleaſeth
me well quod the duke. They departed
fro the duke and went to their lodgynge / and
toke counſayle togyther whether they ſhulde
retourne agayne home without agrement or
els acorde to the dukes demaunde / ſo that the
heritage might clerely remayne & abyde with
the Vycount of Chaſtellon. The nexte daye
they retourned to the duke and offered hym
all his demaunde / and ſo there ſyr Roger of
Spayne and ſyr Eſpaygne du Lyon became
dettours to the duke of Berrey for .xxx. thouſande
frankes / on the condicion that he ſhulde
be meane that the kynge ſhulde take agayne
the ſōme of money that he had lente to the erle
of Foize / and that the Vicount of Chaſtellon
might peaſably enioy the herytage. well quod

the duke lette me alone / I ſhall do it I truſte.
After that day the duke of Berrey (who deſyred
to haue theſe .xxx. thouſande frankes) was
ſo good an adūocate for the vycount of Chaſtellon / 
that he concluded his buſyneſſe at his
owne wyll. The kynge and his counſayle put
all the mater to his pleaſure. and ſo theſe two
knyghtes had letters ſealed of the confyrmacyon
of the countie of Foiz to be the trewe enherytaūce
of the Vicount of Chaſtellon / with
letters therof adreſſed to ye byſſhop of Noyon
and to the lorde de la Ryuer / beynge at Tholouſe.
The 
                  •
               enour of the letters as I was enfourmed
by ſuche credyble perſones as went
on the ſame legacyon / was as foloweth.
            CHarles by the grace of god kynge of
Fraunce / we ſende and cōmende vs
to the ryght reuerende byſſhoppe of
Noyon / and to our knight and chambrelayne
the lorde de la Ryuer. We wyll that ye ſuffre
the vycount of Chaſtellon enherytour of Foiz
and of Bierne / to enioy & poſſede his heritage
of the countie of Foiz / with the purtenaūces / 
ſo that ye take in to your poſſeſſyon the ſōme
of .lx. thouſande frankes at one payment / and
the money payed / than our ſeneſchall of Tholouſe
to make a ſure quytaunce of the recryte
therof. Alſo at a nother paymente I wyll ye receyue
twenty thouſande frankes for your coſtes
and charges in goynge and retournyng / 
and that money payed than make quytaunce
therof vnder the ſeale of offyre of Tholouſe.
Alſo we wyll that ſyr yuan and ſyr Gracyen
of Foiz / baſtarde ſonnes to the erle Gaſcon of
Foiz / haue parte and ceaſonable aſſignement
bothe in landes and goodes of that was their
fathers / by the aduyſe and dyſcrecyon of ſyr
Roger of Spayne and of the vicount of Bruny
quell / ſyr Raynolde of Newcaſtell and the
lorde of Coraſe / to whome we ſhall write that
they maye ſo aquyte them to dyſcharge our
conſcyence / for we made ſuche promyſe to the
erle their father. And if there be any faute in
theſe four lordes or any rebellyon in the Vycount / 
than we diſanull all this ſayde treatie / 
and wyll that it ſtande as boyde. In wytneſſe
her of to theſe letters we haue ſette to our ſeale
in out cytie of Towrs / the .xxii. yere of oure
teygne / the twenty day of the moneth of Decembre.
            THeſe letters made and ſealed / and delyuered / 
the knyghtes of Foiz retourned
fro Towrs / their leaue taken.
This ſeaſon ſyr Loys of Sanxere marſhall
of Fraunce / lay in the marches of Carcaſſone
as ſoueraygne gouernour there / inſtytuted by
the kynge. The byſſhoppe of Noyon and the
Lorde de la Ryuer ſent for hym to Tholouſe / 
and whan he was come thyder they ſayde to
hym. Syr marſhall / the vycount of Chaſtellon
(reputeth hym ſelfe to be enherytour of the
country of Foiz) and we haue ſent in to Fraūce
to the kynge to knowe what he and his counſayle
wyll ſaye in that mater / wherfore be ye
redy with menne of armes on the fronters of
Foiz / and as ſoone as ſyr Roger of Spayne
and ſyr Eſpayne be returned / or that we haue
other meſſage fro the Kynge that they agree
nat on any peace / and that the king wyll haue
the lande of Foiz / than entre you incontynent
and take poſſeſſyon acordynge to ye right and
puyſſaunce that the kynge hathe gyuen vs in
that quarell. Thus the marſhall was redy prouyded / 
and euery day loked for aunſwere fro
the kynge. ¶Nowe we wyll leaue ſpeakyng
of this mater / and ſhewe ſomwhat of the duke
of Bretayne.
            YE haue herde here before what treatie
was at Towrs in Thourayn / bytwene
the frenche kyng and the duke
of Bretaygne / the whiche duke dyde put the
kynge and his counſayle to moche payne / for
he wolde fall to no reaſon. It was ſayde the
kynge demaunded of hym and he refuſed. In
lykewyſe he demaunded / and the kynge refuſed.
Moche treatie there was / but no concluſion
taken. The duke he was redy to ſerue the
kynge and to do hym homage / as farre forthe
as he was bounde to do. Thanne the kynges
counſayle ſayd to hym. Sythe ye knowledge
yourſelfe to be the kinges liegman / why wyll
ye nat than obey to reaſon? Why ſyrs quod he
wherin am I rebell? Than they layde to him
dyuers poyntes. Fyrſte in the beleuynge on
the pope at Auygnon / whome they ſayde the
kynge toke for the trewe pope / ye dyffer ther / 
fro and dyſſymule the mater / for ye wyll obey
none of his cōmaundementes / but gyue all the
benefyces your ſelfe in Bretaygne / and ſuche
as brynge any bulles fro the pope ye wyll nat
knowe theym / this is agaynſte the mageſty

royall / and great ſynne to your cōſcyence and
ſoule. Than the duke aunſwered and ſayde.
As for my conſcyence there is no man ought
to ſpeke therof nor iudge it but all onely god / 
who is ſoueraygne iudge in all ſuche cauſes / 
and ſyth
                  •
                ye argue and appoſe me in that maner▪
I ſhall aunſwere you. As for theſe popes
who are indyfferent / there is no ſure declaration
made of them / and the ſeaſon that the firſt
tydynges came of the choſynge of pope Vrbayne / 
I was in the towne of Gaunt / with my
coſyn the erle of Flaunders / and there he receyued
letters ſealed with the popes ſeale / as
than called Robert of Queſne cardynall / and
in his letter he certifyed to the erle my coſyn / 
that by the grace of god and by the deuyne in
ſpyratyon he was choſen pope / and hadde to
name Vrbayne. Howe than canne this be vndone
agayne / me thynke it were harde to do?
I wyll nat argue agaynſt the kinges maieſte / 
for I am his coſyn and lyege man / and ſhall
well and trewly ſerue hym whan ſo euer I be
requyred / as farre forthe as I am bounde to
do but I wyll ſpeke agaynſt them that counſayle
nat the kynge well. Why ſyr quod they / 
ſhewe vs who they be that do nat counſayle
the kynge as they ought to do / and we ſhall
fynde remedy for them. Syrs 
                  •
                he ye knowe
them better than I do / for ye company with
them oftener than I do / but as touchynge the
benefyces of my countrey / I am nat ſo haute
nor ſo cruell agaynſt ſuche as deſyre them / but
that I ſuffre the clerkes of my countrey to en
               
                  •
               oy
them / by the bulles of pope Clement / but
ſuche cerkes as be nat of the ſame countrey I
refuſe them / and the cauſe why I ſhall ſhewe
you. They wolde beare away the rycheſſe of
my countrey out therof / and deſerue it nat / 
whiche is agaynſt ryght and conſyence / wher
fore I can nat agree therto. And where as ye
ſaye that I am rebell and 
                  〈◊〉
                to agaynſt the
kynges offycers / whanne they come in to my
coūtrey, that is nat ſo, nor wyll nat be. ye ought
to knowe / and if ye do nat lerne it / the fee of the

                  •
               uchy of Bretayne is of ſo noble a condycion / 
that ſoueraygnely there ought none to enterpriſe
any mater there / but alonely their owne
naturall lorde / that is to ſay / the duke of Bretayne
holdeth his court open to here all ryghtes / 
and his offycers to execute all ryghtes in
the lande of Bretaygne / and to do acordynge
to their offyce. And if I haue any offycer that
dothe contrary to ryght / that outher ſtraunger
or other haue cauſe to complayne / I punyſſhe
them and ſhall do / that other ſhall take
enſample by them. more ouer I ſay that ſome
of the kynges counſayle do ſo that they ought
to be reproued / for they do as moche as they
maye do / to noryſſhe warre and hatred bytwene
the kyng and me / the cauſe why is clere
ynough. they ſuffre my coſyn Iohn̄ of Bloys
to do two thynges agaynſt me vnreaſonable.
The fyrſte is / he writeth hym ſelfe Iohan of
Bretayne / by reaſon of that name it ſemeth he
entendeth to attaygne to the herytage of Bretaygne / 
of the whiche he is without and ſhall
be / for I haue chyldren / ſonne and doughter
that ſhall ſuccede after me. Secondely he beareth
the ermyns whiche are the armes of Bretaygne / 
but of trouthe to do me dyſpleaſure
withall / ſir Olyuer clyſſon mayntayneth him
in that opinyon / and as longe as he is in that
caſe I wyllagre to no treatie with the kynge.
As for warre I wyll make none to the kyng / 
bycauſe he is my naturall lorde / but if by yuell
informacyon ye kyng make me warre / I ſhall
defende me / & he ſhall fynde me in myne owne
countre. all this I wyll that the kyng knowe.
            THus the treatie bytwene the kynge
and the duke of Bretayne contynued
rygorouſly / for the duke was lorde
and mayſter of his counſayle / but the frenche
kynge was nat ſo of his / but was ruled by ſyr
Olyuer Cliſſon / and the Begue of Vyllains / 
ſyr Iohan Mercyer / and by ſyr Willyam of
Montague, the duke of Burgoyne / who had
clere vnderſtandyng of euery thynge / ſuffred
the duke of Bretaygnes reaſons and defences
to be ſayde in place / and couertly he ſuſteyned
them / and had the duke of Berrey of his
opynyon / for he hated inwardly them of the
kynges priuy chambre / bycauſe they had dyſtroyed
his treaſourer Betyſache ſhamfully / 
by iuſtyce at Beſyers (as ye haue herde here
before) but he ſuffred it / for he ſawe no tyme to
be reuenged. In this dyfference the duke of
Bretaygne taryed at Towrs thre monethes / 
that their treatie coulde come to no good concluſyon / 
and were at the poynte to haue departed / 
and the kynge was in wyll that as ſoone
as he was retourned in to Fraunce to make a
great aſſemble to make warre the next ſomer
after in to Bretayne agaynſt the duke / & ſuche
of his acorde / & to leaue all other buſines

but the dukes of Berrey & of Burgoyne / the
lorde Coucy / therle of ſaint Poll / ſir Guy of
Tremoile / the chanceller of Fraūce / and dyuers
other prelates & high barons of Fraūce
ſuche as were there / ymagined to withſtāde
this rigorous rebelliōs / & ſpake togider and
ſaid to the kyng. ſir / we that be the iouerayn
lordes & piers of your realme / and be nere of
your lygnage / we ſhulde haue a treatie this
next lent for a peace to be had at Amiēce with
thenglyſſhmen. Wherfore ſir ye had nede to
make haſte / & leaue this yuell wyll bytwene
you and the duke of Bretayne / for if the duke
deꝑte hens without any agrement made bytwene
you / thenglyſſhmen wyll be ye harder
in all their treaties / for they wyll thynke thē
to be ayded and cōforted by the duke of Bretayne
and by his countrey / for the duke hath
thengliſſhmen at his hande whan he wyll / &
if we haue warre atones / bothe with the Englyſſhmen
& bretons / as we haue had or this
they wyll put vs to great payne. Theſe lordꝭ
dyde ſo moche with the kyng & his coūſayle / 
that at laſt they founde a meane bytwene the
kyng & the duke / I ſhewe you what it
was / & ſurely without the ſame meanes had
ben founde / they ſhulde haue come to no concluſion
of good acorde. So it was ye frenche
kyng had a doughter. & the duke of Bretaine
had a ſonne. there was a maryage made bytwene
this ſon̄e & this dought. In lykewiſe
Iohn̄ of Bretayne had a ſon̄e by the dought
of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon & the duke of Bretayne
had a doughter and it was thought to
make ſure peace / yt the mariage bytwene thē
two were neceſſary. Theſe maryages were
agreed & concluded / howbeit for all theſe alyaunces / 
yet Iohn̄ of Bretayne ſhulde leaue
the armes of Bretayne & beare them of Chaſtellon / 
& bycauſe he was extracte by his mother
ſyde of a duke of Bretayne (for his mother
was doughter to a duke of Bretaygne)
therfore he was alowed to bere in his armes
a bordet of ermyne with thre labels goules / 
on the heed of a ſcochyn of ermyns. Thus he
bare theſe deuiſes / & euery thynge was apeſed.
So the duke of Bretayne gate the loue
of the kyng & of his vncles / and dyned with
the kyng / and ſo Iohn̄ of Bretayne was erle
of Pon
                  •
               hieuts. And thus ſhewed great loue
togyder by meanes of theſe mariages / howe
be it the duke in no wyſe wolde ſe nor ſpeke
with ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / he had ſuche diſpleaſure
to hym / howebeit ſir Olyuer made
lyght therof / for he hated the duke alſo with
all his puiſſaūce. Theſe mariages thus acorded / 
& the lordes ſworne and bounde to fulfyll
thē / whan the chyldren ſhulde be ſōwhat
of more age. Than theſe lordes determyned
to departe fro Tourſe & to drawe to Parys / 
for the tyme aproched that they ſhulde be at
Amyence perſonally. The frenche kyng / his
brother / his vncles and his coūſayle / to mere
there with the kyng of Englande / his vncles
and counſayle / who ſhulde be there. So the
duke of Bretayne toke leaue of the Frenche
kyng and of his brother & vncles / and of ſuche
other as he loued beſt / and ſo deꝑted fro
Tourſe & went in to his owne coūtre: and in
lykewiſe ſo dyd all other lordꝭ. The duke of
Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / & the lorde
Coucy taryed there ſtyll / I ſhall ſhewe you
why.
         
         
            ¶Howe therle of Bloys and Mary
of Namure his wyfe / ſolde the countie
of Bloys & all their landes to the
duke of Thourayne / the frenche kynges
brother. Cap. C.lxxxii.
            
               YE haue herde here before in this
hyſtorie / howe Loys of Bloys / 
ſon̄e to therle Guy of bloys died
whan he was yonge / in ye towne
of Beauniont in Heynalt / wher
by the lady Mary doughter to the duke of
Berrey was a widowe / & therby ſhe loſt her
welthe of this worlde / for the chylde was a
gret enheritour / & if he had lyued he had ben
a great lorde. I ſpeke of it bycauſe it ſhulde
be knowen in tyme to come thenheritaūce / to
whome it went out of the right lyne / and by
what maner. therle of Blois & Mary of Namure
his wyfe / were nat in ye caſe to engēdre
children togider / for by great drīkyng & moche
eatynge of wete & delycate meates / they
were ouergrowen with fatneſſe / ſo that the
erle coude nat ryde / but was alwayes caried
in a lytter fro one place to another / or whan
he wolde go a huntyng or haukyng / whiche
ſporte was gretly vſed wt the lordꝭ of Fraūce
The ſame ſeaſon whyle the Frenche kynge
was at Tourſe / the duke of Thourayne had

an ymaginacion whiche he brought to effect
as I ſhall ſhewe you. The duke of Thourayne
knewe well / he had moche rycheſſe lying
by hym / paraduenture a myllion of Floreyns / 
whiche had by reaſon of his mariage
with the lady Valentyne of Myllayne / 
doughter to the erle of Vertus. He wyſt nat
howe to enploy theſe flornes. Than he remē
               bred
howe the erle Guy of Bloys had great
herytagꝭ / and that after his dethe they were
likely to go to dyuers ꝑſones. The erldome
of Bloys ſhulde retourne to Iohan of Bretayne / 
for he was the erles coſyn germayne / 
and the landes of Heynault ſhulde go to the
duke Iulyers and to the duke of Lancaſtre / 
except Chinay whiche ſhulde go to them of
Conflans by homage / and the coūtie of Soiſſons / 
whiche parteyned to therle of Bloys
and was aūciently alyed to hym. The lorde
of Coucy was enherytour therof / by reaſon
of his delyueraūce out of priſone in Englād
Alſo the landes of Drages & Monny ſhulde
retourne to other heyres: And the landes of
Holande and zelande / ſhulde retourne to the
erle of Heynaulte. Thus theſe fayre heryteges
ſhulde be ſparcled abrode: & this knewe
well the lordes of Fraūce. wherfore the duke
of Thourayn who had money lyeng by hym
thought to bye theſe lādes / if he might haue
any reſonable bargayne. Thā he thought to
entreate the kyng to moue therle of Blois in
this mater / and ſpecially at the leſt to bye the
countie of Bloys / whiche was a fayre and a
noble countrey / and well ſyttinge for hym / 
for the countie of Bloyes marched on the duchy
of Thouraygne: and to the Countie of
Bloys parteyned many goodly fees. This
duke of Thourayne reſted ſtyll on his purpoſe / 
& ſeaſed nat tyll he ſpake with ye kynge
his brother & ye duke of Burbone / & with the
lorde of Coucy: bycauſe he was great with ye
erle of Blois / and had to wyfe the doughter
of his coſyn germayne the duke of Loreyne.
The duke of Thourayne and the other lordes
of his affyuite kept this mater ſecretely
fro ye duke of Berey / I ſhall ſhewe you why
The lady Mary his dought was endowed
in all the countie of Bloys to the ſōme of .vi.
M. frankes by yere: and the duke of Berrey
truſted by reaſon of his doughters dowrie ye
the countie of Bloys ſhulde be his after the
erles dethe. this duke of Berrey was a marueylous
couytous prince. the duke of Burgoyne
in lyke wiſe truſted the landes of Holande / 
zelande / & Heynalte to be his / bycauſe
that Margarete his eldeſt dought was maried
to Wylliam / ſon̄e to therle of Heynalte:
wherby he thought outher by bieng or by ſōe
other incident yt choſe landes ſhulde returne
to his ſon̄e erle of Oſtrenant / otherwyſe called
Iohn̄ of Burgoyne / who as than had maried
Margarete eldeſt doughter to therle of
Heynalte. Thus the kyng and theſe ſaid lordes
purpoſed yt at their deꝑtyng fro Tourſe
iii Thourayn to ryde by Blois to ſe their coſyn
therle Guy of Bloys / who was an eight
myle fro Tourſe / in a caſtell of his owne called
ye Caſtell morant & there to treate of this
marchādiſe with hym & with his wyfe the lady
Mary of Namure / who was a couytous
lady. So it was there was a valiant knight
and of great prudence bayly of Blois / called
ſir Raynolde of Sens / who had ꝑfyte informacion
of all this buſynes / by what meanes
I knowe nat. Whan he knewe it he had gret
pyte therof / for loue of therle his lorde / for he
thought by reaſon of his ſale of his lādes / he
ſhuld be diſhonored for euer / & diſherite the
true rightfull heyres / whiche ſhulde be damnacion
to his ſoule. He thought to lette this
mater if he coude / & ſo rode fro Blois & ſpake
with therle & ſaid. ſir / the frenche kynge &
the duke of Thourayn / the duke of Burdon
and the lorde Coucy cometh hyder to you. yt
is true ꝙ therle / why ſpeke you that? Sir ꝙ
he I ſay it bycauſe ye ſhalbe requyred to ſell
your enheritāce / wherfore ye haue nede to take
good aduiſe therin. of thoſe wordꝭ therle
had great marueyle & ſaid / I can nat let men
to ſpeke & make requeſtꝭ / but or I make any
ſuche bargayne to ſell myne enherytaūce / or
to diſheryte myne heyres to my ſhame & rebuke / 
I ſhall rather ſell or ley to pledge all ye
plate I haue. Well ſit ꝙ the knight / remēbre
well the mater whan tyme is / for this that I
haue ſhewed you is without dout. Bayly ꝙ
the erle / I am nat ſo yong nor folyſſhe to enclyne
to any ſuche treaties. thus the bayly deꝑted
fro therle & rode againe to Blois / for he
wolde nat be ſene there at the kynges cōmynge.
Whan the kyng and theſe ſaid lordes cāe
to the caſtell / the erle made them good chere / 
as it was reaſon. The erle and the counteſſe
were right ioyfull / that ye kyng wolde viſyte

them in their owne caſtell. Than the kynge
to drawe the erle to his loue / & to bring hym
to his entent ſayd. Fayre coſyn / I ſe well ye
be a lorde of our realme garnyſſhed with honour
and larges: and haue ben at great coſt / 
and to ayde you / and ſomwhat to recōpence
you / We wyll you gyue and ayde / that ſhall
be well worthe to you twentie thouſande frā
               kes
in the countie of Blois. Therle thanked
the kyng of his gyfte / but he had neuer profite
therof / for he had neuer nothyng. Than
the kynge began to treate the Erle to ſell the
countie of Bloyes to the duke of Thourayn
The kynge and the duke of Burbone ſpake
fyrſt / and founde therle very colde and tarre
of in that mater. Than the lordes drewe to
the counteſſe of Bloyes / and ſhewed her ſo
many colored reaſons / and ſhe hers / that after
her huſbandes dethe / ſhe was lyke to be
but a poore lady. Wherfore they ſaid it were
moche better for her to be a ryche lady and a
puiſſaunt of golde and ſyluer / and iewelles / 
than to be poore. Sayeng howe ſhe was lykely
to ouerlyue her huſbade. Therfore they
deſyred her to counſayle her huſbande to make
this marchaundyſe. The counteſſe / who
was a couytous lady: And for loue to haue
the floreyns / ſhe enclyned to their deſyres / 
and ſhe dyd ſo moche with the helpe of other
as the ayde of a varlet of the Erles chambre
called Sohier borne at Malygnes / ſonne to
a weyuer of clothes / but he was ſo great wt
the erle of Bloyes / that all thynge was done
by hym / & without hym nothyng done. And
the erle had gyuen hym in fees and herytagꝭ
more than fyue hundred frankes by yere. Be
holde and conſydre what myſchefe great lordes
be brought vnto by meane of ſeruaūtes.
This Sohier had nother wytte nor reaſon / 
to be greatly alowed / but it was alonely the
folyſſhe loue that his maiſter hadde to hym.
In lykewiſe the duke of Berrey the ſame ſeaſon
had one with hym called Iaques Thybaulte / 
who was of no reputacion / yet the duke
at dyuers tymes had gyuen hym the ſōme
of two hundred thouſande frankes / and yet
all was but loſte. This Sohier coulde nor
can nat excuſe hym ſelfe / but that if he had lyſted
he myght well haue broken that marchā
               diſe / 
yt therle his mayſter made. but to pleaſe
the kynge / the duke of Thourayne / the duke
of Burbone / the lorde of Coucy and the coū
               teſſe / 
who was agreed therto by couitouſnes
of the florens. He rowned ſo in his maiſters
eare / that the Erle wente from his promyſe
that he had made to his bayly. And to there
the reuercion of the countie of Bloyes after
his diſceaſe was ſolde / for the ſomme of two
hundred thouſande frankes / and the duke of
Thouraygne to delyuer to the lady of Dunoyes
for her dowrie / whiche was aſſygned
to her / ſixe thouſande frankes. And furthermore
he ſhulde haue made another ſale of all
his landes in Heynaulte: And the Duke of
Thourayne to haue payde for that two hundred
thouſande frankes. Howe be it therin
the erle of Bloys reſerued to knowe the erle
of Heynaltes pleaſure therin / who was his
naturall lorde / to whom he owed faythe and
homage for thoſe landes. Howe be it yt kyng
and the duke of Thourayn toke that charge
on them / and to diſcharge the erle / what ſoeuer
ſhulde fall after. Thus or they departed
they bounde the erle by promyſe and by writynges
ſealed / as they might well and eaſely
do / for he had there none of his coūſayle ſaue
Sohier / who neuer was at ſcole / nor knewe
no letter on the boke: Moche after this maner
went this marchandiſe. and I haue written
this mater as iuſtely as I coude / to thentent
that herafter in tyme to come / by reaſon
of writyng / the trouthe ſhulde be knowen.
For the erle Guye of Bloys my lorde & mayſter / 
as he that was ignorant and yuell counſayled / 
more by his wyfe and varlet Sohier
thā by any other / made this yuell bargayne.
And whan theſe maters were concluded and
ſurely made by the kyng / the duke of Thourayne / 
and their counſayle / than the lordes
toke their leaue and retourned in to Fraūce.
Great brute was made of theſe ſales in dyuers
countries.

knight nor ſquier for no maner of cauſe ſhulde
preſume to ſpeke to the king wtout ye kyng

fyrſt dyde call hym. Nor alſo that the knightes
nor ſquyers of Fraunce ſhulde talke nor

men were preſent / But to fynde comunynge
and paſtyme with theym. Alſo it
was ordayned / that all hoſtes and their ſeruauntes / 
in anywyſe / ſhulde nat conuey or
hyde any Bowes or Arrowes / or any other
thynge parteyninge to the Englyſſhe men / 
without makynge of large amendes / without
it were gyuen them by the Englyſſhmen
of their curteſy: than to take it or els nat. All
theſe thynges were determyned by delyberacyon
or good counſayle / to do the Englyſſhe
men the more honoure / for they truſted of a
good concluſyon of peace. Nighe euery day
a fiftene dayes toguyder / theſe lordes were
in counſayle / and brought nothyng to cōcluſyon / 
for their demaundes were greatly different.
The Frenche men demaunded to haue
Calais raſed and beaten downe / in ſuche
wyſe / that no perſone ſhulde dwell there after.
The Englyſſhe men wolde in no wyſe
agree to that treatie: for it ought to be beleued / 
that Calais was ye towne of the worlde
that the cōmons of Englande loued beſt / for
as longe as they be lordes of Calays / They
ſayde they bare the kayes of Fraunce vnder
their gyrdell. Thoughe the lordes departed
euery daye vnagreed yet they departed a ſō
               der
right amiably / for euery daye they poynted
to were agayne the nexte day / bothe parties
truſtyng at laſt to cōclude on ſome good
poynt. The frenche kyng made thenglyſſhe
men in yt ſpace thre notable dyners at his palais.
In lykewiſe ſo dyde the duke of Thourayne / 
the duke of Berrey the duke of Burgoyne / 
the duke of Burbone / the lorde of
Coucy / and the erle of ſaynt Poule: Eche of
theſe made the Englyſſhe men a great dyner
And for euery thyng that the Englyſſhmen
toke in the towne was payd for / and clerkes
apoynted by the kynge and his counſayle to
write euery thyng / and euery man apoynted
for their money to the chambre of accomptes
It ought to be knowen / that Iohan duke of
Lancaſtre and his brother the duke of yorke
for all that they were come thyder on truſt of
peace / yet they had charge of the kyng of Englande
and of his counſayle / that what ſoeuer
treatie they made / in no wiſe they ſhulde
nouther gyue nor take any maner of thynge.
            MAny were of the opynion / that the
cōmynaltie of Englande rather enclyned
to warre than to peace / for in
the tyme of good kyng Edwarde the thirde / 
and of his ſon̄e the prince of Wales / they had
ſo many fayre and highe vyctories on ye frenche
men / and ſo great conqueſtes / with ſo moche
money for raunſomes / ſellyng and pateſynge
of townes & countreis / that they were
become marueylous riche: for many ſuche as
were no gentylmen of byrthe / by reaſon of
their hardyneſſe and valyaunt aduentures / 
wan and conquered ſo moche golde and ſyluer
that they became noble / and roſe to great
honour. And ſo ſuch as folowed after wolde
folowe the ſame lyfe / how beit after yt dayes
of the ſayd kyng Edwarde and ye prince his
ſonne / by the wyſdome and highe enterprice
of ſir Bertram of Cleſquy / and by the ayde
of other good knyghtes of Fraūce. The Englyſſhmen
were than agayne ſore put backe
The duke of Glouceſtre ſonne to the ſayde
kynge Edwarde / and vncle as than to kyng
Richarde / than beyng at Amyence / & dyuers
other lordes / knightes / and ſquyers were of
the ſame opynion that the cōmons were of in
Englande / and enclyned rather to the warre
than to peace / to the entent therby to ſuſteyne
their eſtate. By the occaſion therof the peace
was the harder to driue. yet the kynge & the
duke of Lancaſtre wolde fayne haue hadde
peace / for by their meanes that metynge at
Amyēce was apoynted / howbeit they wolde
nat diſpleaſe the cōmens of Englande. The
Englyſſhe men wolde gladlye haue hadde a
peace / ſo they myght be reſtored agayne to al
ſuche landes as was agreed on / at the treaty
before Charters / and that the Frenche men
ſhulde paye fourtene hundred thouſande frā
               kes / 
whiche was vnpayed whan the warre
began to renewe.
            IN this ſeaſon / thus great cōmunycacion
there was at the cytie of Amyence / 
on treatie of peace: and the
lordes that were there on bothe parties toke
great payne in the cauſe. It myght well be
marueyled why this peace toke none effecte / 
for ſpecialy the duke of Burgoyne dyd what
he coude for the Frenche partie / and the duke
of Lancaſtre for the Englyſſhe partie. Sauyng
the charge that he had / whiche he durſt

nat paſſe. Whan theſe lordes ſawe that they
coulde come to no good concluſyon / than the
frenchemen ſomwhat to apeaſe and to pleaſe
the englyſſhmen / and the rather therby to fall
to ſome reaſon / it was offred to them to enjoy
ſtyll peaſably / all that euer they were as than
in poſſeſſyon of in Acquytayne / and nyne dyoces
to be quite delyuered without any reſorte / 
ſo that Calays myght be beaten downe. And
alſo they offred to paye in thre yere after / the
ſomme of .xiiii. hundred thouſande frankes.
Than the duke of Lancaſtre and the englyſſh
counſayle anſwered and ſayd. Syrs we haue
taried here a longe ſeaſon and haue concluded
nothyng / nor we canne nat conclude tyll we be
retourned in to Englande / and than we ſhall
ſhewe all your deſyres and offers to the kyng
our ſouerayne lorde / and to the thre eſtates of
the realme / and of one thinge be you ſure / that
as moch dyligence as I & my brother of yorke
can do / ſhall be doone to bringe your deſyre to
paſſe / except ye beatyng downe of Calays / we
dare nat ſpeke therof / for if we dyd we ſhulde
ryn in the indygnacyon and hatred of ye moſt
parte of all the realme of Englande / and yet
were we better to ſpeke no worde therof. theſe
wordes ſomwhat contented the french kynge
and his coūſayle / and deſyred them that whan
they were returned into England to do their
dyligence in the mater / & they ſaid they wolde
do what they coude for the frenche party / ſayeng
howe the warre had endured ouer longe / 
and many yuell inconuenyentes hath enſued
therby in the worlde. than it was conſidred bytwene
the parties / bycauſe the truce fayled the
next mydſomer after / bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / to contynue it lengar the ſpace of an
hole yere / bothe by lande and by ſee bytwene
them / their alyes / and adherentes / and therto
the lordes of Englande were agreed. Than
the frenche kynges counſayle deſyred to ſende
two french knightes to go with them into Englande / 
and at their retourne to bringe worde
what caſe they ſhulde fynde the realme of Englande
in. The duke of Lancaſtre and ye duke
of yorke were contente therwith. It was ſhewed
me / and alſo the apparaunce was great / 
howe that the frenche kynge deſyred greatly
to haue peace / for as than great brute ranne
through Fraunce and other places howe that
Lam

               rabaquyn was entred with great puiſſaunce
of turkes in to the realme of Hungry.
ſyr Boucyquant thelder marſhall of Fraunce
brought thoſe newes / and ſyr Iohan of Charon / 
who were newely retourned fro the partyes
of Grece and Turkey / wherfore the frenche
kynge in his youthe / had great affectyon
to go in voyage / and to go and ſe the ſayd Lamorabaquyn / 
and to recouer the realme of Armony / 
whiche the turkes had wonne fro the
kynge Lyon of Armony / who was the ſame
tyme at Amyence / and he ſhewed the cauſe of
his comynge thyder / to the duke of Lancaſtre
and to the duke of yorke. They knewe hym
well for they had ſene him before in the realme
of Englande. He was in Englande to treate
for the peace whan the frenche kynge was at
Sluſe. And conſyderynge the kynge of Armonyes
buſyneſſe at the ende of their parlyamente / 
the frenche kynge ſayde to the duke of
Lancaſtre. Fayre nephewe if peace maye be
had bytwene vs and the kynge of Englande / 
we might than make a voyage in to Tukey / 
comfortyng the kynge of Hungry / and the emperour
of Conſtantynople / whome Lamorabaquyn
dothe moche trouble / and let vs recouer
the realme of Armony / whiche the turkes
kepe. We here ſaye that Lamorabaquyn is a
valyaunt man / and of great enterpriſe / and agaynſt
ſuche perſones as are contrary to our
beleue / and daily dothe trouble and greue vs / 
we ought to enclyne our ſelfe to defende our
cryſten faythe / wherfore fayre nephewe helpe
you to prouyde for this voyage in the realme
of Englande. The duke of Lancaſtre promyſed
to do his deuoyre in that behalfe. Thus
they toke leaue eche of other.
            THis counſayle at Amyence endured
a fyftene dayes / than the Englyſſhe
men departed / and had with them in
writyng the cōcluſion of their treatie / to ſhewe
to the kynge of Englande and his counſayle.
Than the ducheſſe of Irelande departed fro
Amyēce and toke leaue of her father the lorde
of Coucy / and retourned with the englyſſhe
lordes. And fro that tyme that they departed
fro Calais tyll they came thyder agayne / they
ſpent nothyng without they lyſt / for the french
kynge made euery thynge to be payed / bothe
for them ſelfe and for their horſes. The duke
of Burgoyne than retourned into Archoys to
the cytie of Arras / and there he founde the ducheſſe
his wyfe / who had vyſited the countrey

of Flaunders. The duke of Thourayne / the
duke of Berrey / and the duke of Butbone / taryed
with the kynge and the kinge purpoſed
to go to Beamoys & to Gyſors to ſporte hym
there in the waye to Parys. With the duke of
Lancaſtre & the duke of yorke certayne knightes
of Fraunce wente in to Englande / as ſyr
Iohan of Caſtell Morante / & ſir Taupyns of
Cantmell / to bringe aunſwere agayne out of
England / and ſir Raynolde du Roy / the lorde
of Moncaurell / and ye lorde of the olde towne / 
conueyed them to Calays / and than toke their
leaue / and the englyſſhe men paſſed ouer the
ſee to Deuer / and there founde the kynge and
the duke of Gloceſtre taryeng for them. Whan
the kyng ſawe them he had great comunynge
with them of the ſ
                  •
               ate of the parlyamente of
Amyence. The kynge was well content with
that his vncles had done / but than the duke of
Gloceſtre / who was alwayes harde agaynſt
the treatie of peace ſayd / howe there coulde no
good concluſyon be taken in this treatye tyll
the mater were brought to Weſtmynſter to a
generall counſayle of all the thre aſtates of the
realme / and than to folowe their aduyſes and
none otherwyſe. The duke of Gloceſters wordes
were well herde / no manne wolde ſaye agaynſt
hym / for he was greatly in the loue of
the realme. Than it was ſhewed to the knightes
of Fraunce that they muſte go with them
to London / otherwyſe they coulde haue none
anſwere. The two knightes obeyed as it was
reaſon. Than the kynge toke his way and the
lordes with him to London. Whan the kynge
came to Darfforde / he tooke his waye to Eltham / 
and refreſſhed him there with the quene
and than came to Shene / and wente agaynſt
ſaynte Georges feeſt to Wyndſore / and there
the knyghtes of Fraunce were anſwered. but
or I ſhewe you their aunſwereꝭ I wyll ſomewhat
ſpeke of the frenche kynge.
            AFter that this aſſemble and coūſayle
had been at Amyence / the Frenche
kynge for lacke of good gydyng fell
ſycke of the feuer / wherfore he was counſayled
to chaunge the ayre. So he was layde in
a lytter and caryed to Beamoys / and there taryed
in the byſſhops palays tyll he was hole
and recouered / his brother the duke of Thourayne
with him / & his vncles the dukes of Berrey
and Burbone / there he helde his Eaſter.
And after whan the kynge was ſtronge and
myght well ryde / he rode to Gyſors / the entryng
in to Normādy / to haue there the ſporte
of huntynge / for theraboute were many fayre
wodes. The kyng beynge there ſir Bernarde
of Armynake / who was brother to Iohan of
Armynake came to the kynge in good array / 
and the Dolphyn of Auuergne in his company / 
whome he founde at Parys in his waye.
There the erle of Armynake and the Erle of
Rodays made their reliefe and homage to the
kynge / acordinge to the cuſtome as other lordes
of Fraunce made their relyefe / for ſuche
landes as they helde in fee of the kynge. And
whan euery thyng was writen and regeſtred / 
they toke their leaue and retourned to Paris
togyther / and fro thence to their countreys / to
Auuergne and to Languedoc. And about the
feeſt of Aſcenſyon tyde the frenche kynge retourned
to Parys in good helthe / and lodged
at his howſe of ſaynte Poll / the whiche was
ordeyned for hym / and thyder was come the
frenche quene and the duches of Thourayne.
            NOwe let vs ſpeke of ſyr Iohan of Caſtell
Morante / and of ſyr Taupyn of
Cantmell / who were in Englande taryenge
for an anſwere of the kyng and his counſayle.
They were at Wyndeſore at ſaynte Georges
feeſt / where was the kynge / his vncles / and other
great lordes of Englande. There theſe
lordes counſayled togyther on ſuche promyſe
as they had made to the frenche kyng and his
counſayle at Amyence / and determyned to delyuer
the two Frenche knyghtes / that dayly
called on them for an aunſwere. Than theſe
knyghtes were ſente for on a day / and it was
ſayde to them thus. Syrs be contente / for all
thinges conſydred ye canne haue of vs no full
anſwere at this tyme / for it wolde be harde as
nowe to aſſemble togyther the thre eſtates of
the realme / vntyll the feeſt of Mychelmas / at
whiche tyme they muſte nedes be at the parlyamente
at Weſtmynſter / and to excuſe you
we ſhall write letters for the ſame purpoſe / at
whiche ſeaſon if you or any other for the partie
of Fraūce wyll traueyle ſo farre as to come
thyder / they ſhall haue a reaſonable anſwere / 
ſuche as generally the hole counſayle of the
thre aſtates ſhall agre vnto. whan the frenche
knyghtes ſawe what aunſwere they had / and
coulde haue none other / they aunſwered and

ſayd. Syr we are contente with that ye haue
ſayd / lette vs haue our letters and we ſhall retourne.
Than their letters were delyuered to
them / and ſo toke their leaue of the kynge and
of other lordes / and ſo came fro Wyndeſore to
London and / made thē redy to departe. The
kyng of Englande cauſed all their ceſtes and
charges to be payed for / and conueyed to Douer / 
and there taryed a fyue dayes for lacke of
wynde / and on the ſixte day they departed and
aryued at Boloyne / and whanne their horſes
were vnſhypped they rode to Amyēce by ſmall
iourneys / & ſo to Paris / and there they founde
the kynge and his lordes. It was aboute the
feeſt of Penthecoſt. Their letters were redde / 
wherby they vnderſtode the ordynaūce of the
englyſſhmen. As it was ſhewed me the kynge
nor his counſayle toke lytell regarde to the mater / 
for within a ſeaſon after they had moche
ado in other places.

            ¶Howe ſyr Peter of craon through
yuell wyll / by ſubtyle crafte / beate
downe ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / wherwith
the Kynge and his counſayle
were ſore diſpleaſed. Ca. C.lxxxv.
            
               YE haue well herde here before
how 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Peter of Craon / who
was a knyght of great lygnage / 
but he was farre out of the frenche
kynges grace and the duke of
Thourayns. if he dyd ſomoche to cauſe them
to be diſpleaſed with him he dyd yuell. ye haue
herde alſo howe he was gone in to Bretayne
to the duke / who ſhewed hym that the yuell
wyll that the kynge bare hym was by the meanes
of ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon. It may well be
that he was ſo enfourmed / in that he hadde ſo
great hate to the conſtable ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
for he ſtudyed euer after howe to dyſtroy
hym. Thus whyle ſyr Peter of Craon was
with the duke of Bretaygne / they wolde often
tymes comune togyder / and deuiſe howe they
myght bringe ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon to dethe / 
for they ſayd that and he were ones deed there
was none yt wolde greatly reuenge his dethe.
The duke repēted hym that he had nat ſlayne
hym whan he had hym in priſone / and wolde
as than that it had coſte hym a hundred thouſande
frankes / that he had hym agayne at his
wyll. Whan ſyr Peter of Craon ſawe that the
duke had ſuche hatred to ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
he purpoſed a marueylous ymaginacien
in himſelfe / for by apparaūce men ſhulde gyue
iudgement. This knyght thought howe ſo
euer it were that he wolde ſlee the conſtable / 
and thought to entende to nothynge els tyll he
had ſlayne hym with his owne handes / or cauſed
hym to be ſlayne / and afterwarde entreat
for peace. He douted nothyng Iohn̄ of Blois / 
nor the ſonne of the Vicounte of Rohan / who
had wedded two of the conſtables doughters / 
he thought to do well ynough with theym as
longe as ye duke was on his parte / for he ſawe
well the ſtrengthe and puyſſaunce of Bloys
was greatly feblyſſhed / for the Erle Guy of
Bloys had ſolde the herytage of Bloys to the
duke of Thourayn / whiche ſhulde haue ronne
by ſucceſſyon to therle of Pointhycur Iohan
of Bloys / wherby he thought that the duke of
Thourayne ſhewed hym but ſmall loue nor
alyaunce of lynage / to bye away his enherytaunce / 
wherfore this ſyr Peter thought if ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon were deed / ſone to apeaſe
the kynges yuell wyll and the duke of Thourayns / 
and therby ſone to ouercome the lorde
de la Ryuer and ſyr Iohan Mercyer / Montagu / 
the Begue of Villayns / and ſyr Iohan
of Bulle / and other of the Kynges chambre / 
ſuche as ſuſteyned the conſtable. for he knewe
well that the duke of Berrey and the duke of
Burgoyne loued them nothynge in wardely / 
whatſoeuer they ſhewed outwardly. Thus ſir
Peter of Craon perceyuered ſtyll in his opynyon / 
and deuyſed in his imagynacion by the
entyſyng of the dyuell / who neuer ſlepeth / but
waketh and enbraſeth their hartes to do yuell
that enclyneth to his exortacion. Thus the dyuell
dayly layde the mater before this knyghtes
eyen / or he put the mater to execuſyon / but
if he had iuſtly ymagyned the doutes and parelles / 
and myſcheuouſneſſe that myght fall
by his yuell dede / reaſone and wyſe atemperaunce
ſhulde haue cauſed hym to haue done
otherwyſe. But it is often tymes ſaid that the
great deſyre that a man hath to haue the execuſyon
of that thynge / or it be fallen often tymes
quencheth reaſon and wyſdome / therfore
often tymes vyces are mayſters and vertues

vyolate and corrupted / and for bycauſe that
ſpecially this ſyr Peter of Craon had ſo great
affection to the dyſtructyon of the conſtable / 
therfore he lyghtly enclyned to the temptacion
to do outrage and folly / and thought that if he
myght ſlee the conſtable and returne agayne
ſafely in to Bretayne / that no man wolde ſeke
hym there if they dyd he truſted that the duke
wolde excuſe hym / and that if the worſte fell / 
that the Frenche kynge came thyder with a
great puyſſaunce / than in a nyght to entre in
to a ſhyppe and ſo to go to Burdeaux to Bay
on / or in to Englande / and there he thought
well he ſhulde nat be purſewed / for he knewe
well that the englyſſhe men hated the conſtable
bycauſe of the crueltyes that he had doone
and conſented to be done ſythe he was tourned
frenche howe be it before that he had done
many notable ſeruyces to the englyſſhe men / 
as it hath ben reherſed here before in this hyſtory.
            SIr Peter of Craon for to accōplyſſh
his deſyre / had longe ſtudyed in his
mynde / howe to brynge his purpoſe
to paſſe / and kepte his purpoſe cloſe and ſecrete.
I knowe nat if he ſhewed it to the duke
of Bretayne or nat / ſome thought 
                  •
               es / bycauſe
after the dede done by hym and his company / 
he toke the next way he coude in to Bretayne / 
and tooke for his ſauegarde the duke of Bretaygne.
and alſo before the dede done he ſolde
his caſtelles and herytage that he had in Aniou
to the duke of Bretaygne / and renyed his
homage to the frenche kynge / and ſayd howe
he wolde go ouer the ſee. Of all theſe maters
I paſſe breuely / but I ſhall declare the dede / 
for I ſyr Iohan Froyſart auctour of this hyſtory / 
whan this vnhappy dede was doone by
ſyr Peter of Craon / agaynſte ſyr Olyuer of
Clyſſon / I was the ſame tyme at Paris / wherfore
I ought to be well enfourmed of the mater / 
acordyng to the enquery that I made therin
to knowe the trouthe. The ſame tyme this
ſyr Peter had in the towne of Parys a fayre
houſe ſtandynge in the churche yarde of ſaynt
Iohans / as dyuers other lordes had in the cytie
for their pleaſure. In this houſe there was
a keper. ſyr Peter of Craon had ſent of his ſeruauntes
to Parys / and they prouyded largely
in the houſe with wyne / corne / fleſſhe / ſalte / 
and other prouyſyons. Alſo he had writen to
the keper that he ſhulde bye certayne armure
as cotes of ſtele / gauntletes / ſtoles and other
harneſſe for .xl men / and that doone to ſende
hym worde therof to thentente that he wolde
ſende for them / and ſecretly all this do be done.
The keper who thought none yuell and to obey
his mayſters cōmaundement / bought all
this marchaūdyſe. And all this ſeaſon he was
in a caſtell of his owne in Aniou called Sable / 
and he ſent one weke thre or four ſeruauntes
to his houſe in Parys / and ſo wekely tyll
he had there a .xl. and ſhewed them nothynge
for what cauſe he ſent them thyder / but he charged
them to kepe them ſelfe cloſe in his howſe
in any wyſe / and what ſo euer they lacked the
keper of his houſe ſhulde prouyde for it. and
on a daye I ſhall ſhewe you the cauſe why I
ſende you thyder before / & ye ſhall haue good
wages. They dyd as he commaunded them / 
and came priuely to Parys / and entred in to
the houſe by nyght and in the mornynges / for
as than the gates of Parys nyght and daye
ſtode open. There aſſembled in that houſe ſo
many togyther / that they were a .xl. companyons
hardy men and outragyous. Howe be
it there were ſome that if they hadde knowen
wherfore they came thyderꝭ they wolde nat
haue come there / yet they kepte them ſelfe ſecrete.
Than at ye feeſt of Pentecoſt ſyr Peter
of Craon came to Paris ſecretly & entred into
his howſe / dyſguyſed lyke a ſeruaunt. Than
he called for the porter that kepte the gate / and
ſayd. I cōmaunde the on payne of thy lyfe let
no man / woman / nor chylde entre in to this
houſe / nor none to go out without my cōmaundement.
The porter obeyed as it was reaſon / 
and ſo dyd the keper / and he cōmaunded the
kepers wyfe & her chyldren to kepe her chambre
and nat to iſſue out therof / wherin he dyd
wyſely / for if the woman and chyldren had
gone abrode in the ſtreates / the comynge thyther
of ſyr Peter Craon had been knowe / for
chyldren and women naturally are harde to
kepe counſayle / of that thynge a man wolde
haue kepte ſecrete. Thus ſyr Peter and his
company were ſecretly in his howſe tyll the
day of the holy ſacramente / and euery day ſyr
Peter had a brode his ſpyes that brought him
worde of the ſtate of ſyr Olyuer Clyſſon / and
tyll that daye he coulde fynde no tyme to execute
his enterpriſe / wherwith he was ſore diſpleaſed
in hym ſelfe. The ſaid day the frenche

kynge kepte a feeſt with open courte with all
the lordes that were there. Alſo the quene and
the duches of Thourayne were there in great
ioy and ſolace. The ſame day after dyner the
yonge luſty knyghtes were armed and iuſted
valyauntly / in the preſence of the kynge and
of the quene / and other ladyes and damoſels / 
and contynued tyll it was nere nyght / and by
the iudgement of the ladyes and harauldes / 
the price was gyuen to ſyr Gillyam of Flaunders
erle of Namure. And the kynge made all
the lordes and ladyes a great ſupper / and after
ſupper daunced tyll it was one of the clock
after mydnyght. than euery man departed to
their lodgynges / ſome to one place & ſome to
another without feare or doute of any thyng.
Syr Olyuer of Cliſſon who as than was conſtable
of Fraunce / departed fro the kynges
place laſt of all other / and had taken his leaue
of the kynge / and than went through the duke
of Thourayns chambre / and ſayde to hym.
Syr wyll ye tary here all nyght / or els go to
your lodgyng of Poullayne. This Poullayn
was the dukes treaſourer / and dwelte a lytell
beſyde the ſygne of the Lyon of ſyluer. Than
the duke ſayde / conſtable I can nat tell as yet
whether I do tary here or els go thyder / go ye
your waye to your lodgynge / for it is tyme.
Than ſyr Olyuer toke his leaue of the duke
and ſayd. ſyr god ſende you good nyght / and
ſo departed / and in the ſtreate he founde his
ſeruauntes and his horſe / an eyght perſones / 
and two torches. Than he rode forthe to entre
in to the hygh ſtreate of ſaynt Kateryns.
            SIr Peter of Craon had the ſame night
layde good ſpyall on 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
                Olyuer of Cliſſon / 
and knewe well that he was bydden behynde
his company with the kynge / and that
his horſe taryed at the kynges gate for hym.
Than he moūted on his horſe and all his company
well armed couertly / and there paſt nat
ſire of his company that knew his entent. and
whan he came in to ſaynte Katheryns ſtreate
there he taryed / and abode priuely for the conſtables
cōmyng. And as ſone as the conſtable
was iſſued out of the ſtreate of ſaynt Powle / 
and came in to the hyghe ſtreate and his torches
beſyde hym / and came rydynge talkyng
with a ſquyer of his / ſayenge. To morowe I
muſt haue at dyner with me ye duke of Thourayne / 
the lorde Coucy / ſyr Iohan of Vyen / 
ſyr Charles Dangers / the barone of Vrey / 
and dyuers other / wherfore ſpeke to my ſtewarde
that they lacke nothynge. And ſayeng
of thoſe wordes ſyr Peter Craon and his company
came on hym / and at the firſt they ſtrake
out the torches. And whan the conſtable herde
the ruſſhynge of the horſes behynde hym / no
thought it had been the duke of Thourayne
that had folowed and ſported with hym / and
ſayde. Ah ſyr it is yuell doone / but I pardon
you / ye are yonge and full of play and ſporte.
With thoſe wordes ſyr Peter of Craon drewe
out his ſwerde and ſaid / ſlee the conſtable ſlee
hym / for he ſhall dye. What arte thou quod
Clyſſon that ſpekeſt thoſe wordes? I am Peter
of Craon thyne enemye / thou haſt ſo often
tymes dyſpleaſed me / that nowe thou ſhalte
make amēdes / and therwith ſtrake at the conſtable / 
and ſyr Peters men drewe oute their
ſwordes and ſtrake at the conſtable / who had
no wepon / but a ſhorte knyfe of two foote of
length / and defended hym ſelfe as well as he
myght / and his men were without armure / 
and ſone put a brode fro their mayſter. Than
ſyr Peters men ſayd ſhall we ſlee them all. yea
quod ſir Peter / all ſuche as make any defence.
Their defence was but ſmall / for they were
but eight perſones and without armure. Sir
Peter demaunded nothynge but the dethe of
the conſtable / ſome that were there whan they
knewe it was the conſtable they gaue him but
faynte ſtrokes / for a thynge doone by trayſon
is doone cowardly without any hardyneſſe.
The conſtable defended hymſelfe valyauntly
with that wepyn that he had / howe be it his
defence hadde vayled hym but lytell / and the
great grace of god had nat ben. Styll he ſate
on his horſe tyll he had a full ſtroke on ye heed / 
with whiche ſtroke he fell fro his horſe ryght
agaynſt a bakers dore / who was vp and buſy
to bake breed / and had left his dore halfe open
whiche was happy for the conſtable / for as he
fell fro his horſe he fell agaynſte the dore / and
the dore opened and he fell in at the dore / and
they that were a horſebacke coulde nat entre
after hym / the dore was to lowe and to lytell.
God ſhewed great grace to the conſtable / for
if he had fallen in the ſtreates as he dyde in at
the dore / or if the dore had been ſhytte / he had
ben ſlayn without remedy / but they that were
a horſebacke durſte nat alyght / and alſo they
thought / and ſo dyd ſyr Peter yt on the ſtroke

that he had on the heed / that at laſte it ſhulde
be his dethes wounde. Than ſyr Peter ſayd / 
go we hence / we haue done ynough / for if he
be nat deed / he wyll dye on the ſtroke that he
hathe on the heed / for it was a great ſtroke.
Therwith they departed and rode a waye a
good pace to the gate of ſaynte Anthony / and
rode out therat / for as than the gate was open
and had ben ten yere / ſythe the frenche kynge
retourned fro the batayle of Roſebeque / and
that the ſayd conſtable put downe the malles
of Parys / and punyſſhed them for their rebellyons.
            THus ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon was lefte
in this caſe / as a man halfe deed and
more / in the bakers houſe / who was
ſore abaſſhed whan he knewe it was the conſtable / 
as for his men had lytell hurte / for ſyr
Peter and his men loked for nothynge but to
haue ſlayne the conſtable. Than ſyr Olyuers
men aſſembled togyther / and entred in to the
bakers houſe / and there founde their it mayſter
ſore hurte on the heed / and the blode rennynge
downe by his vyſage / wherwith they were
ſore abaſſhed / and good cauſe why. there they
made great complayntes / fyrſte they feared
he had ben deed. Anone tydinges hereof came
to the kynges lodgynge / and it was ſayde to
the kyng / as he was goynge to his bedde. Ah
ſyr we canne nat hyde fro you the great myſchiefe
that is nowe ſodenly fallen in Parys.
What myſchefe is that quod the kynge? Syr
quod they / your conſtable ſyr Olyuer of Cliſſon
is ſlayne. Slayne quod the kynge / and
howe ſo / and who hath done that dede? Syr
quod they we canne nat tell / but this myſchefe
is fallen on hym here by in the ſtreate of ſaynt
Kateryn. Well quod the kynge / light vp your
torches / I wyll go & ſe hym. Torches anone
were lyghted vp. The kynge put on a cloke
and his ſlyppers on his fete. Than ſuche as
kept watche the ſame nyght went forthe with
the kynge / and ſuche as were a bed & herde of
theſe tydyngꝭ roſe vp in haſt and folowed the
kyng / who was gone forthe with a ſmall company / 
for the kynge taryed for no manne / but
wente forthe with theym of his chambre with
torches before him and behynde him / and had
no mo chamberlayns with hym but ſir Gaultier
Martell and ſyr Iohn̄ of Lygnac / Thus
the king came to the bakers houſe and entred / 
and certayne torches taryed without. Than
the kynge founde his conſtable nere deed as
it was ſhewed him / but nat fully deed / and his
men had taken of all his geare to ſe his woundes / 
howe he was hurte. And the fyrſt worde
that the hynge ſayd was. Conſtable howe is
it with you? Dere ſyr ꝙ he ryght febly. Who
hath brought you in this caſe quod the kyng.
Syr quod he Peter of Craon and his company
traytourſly / and without defence. Conſtable
quod the kynge / there was neuer dede
ſo derely bought as this ſhall be. Than phyſycions
and ſurgeons were ſent for on all partes / 
and whan they came the kyng ſayd to his
owne ſurgyons. Syrs / looke what caſe my
conſtable is in / and ſhewe me the trouthe / for
I am ſory of his hurte. Than they ſerched his
woundes in euery parte. Than the kynge demaunded
of them and ſayd. Syrs howe ſaye
you / is he in any parell of dethe. They all anſwered
and ſayd. ſyr ſurely there is no ieoperdy
of dethe in hym / but that within theſe .xv.
dayes he ſhall be able to ryde. With that aunſwere
the kynge was ryght ioyous and ſayd / 
thanked be god theſe be good tydynges / and
than ſaid. Conſtable be of good chere and care
nothynge / for there was neuer treſpas ſorer
punyſſhed than this ſhall be / vpon the traytours
that haue done this dede / for I take this
mater as myne owne. The conſtable with a
feble voyce anſwered. Sir god rewarde your
grace for your noble vyſytacyon. Than the
kyng toke his leaue and departed and retourned
to his lodgynge / and in contynent ſente
for the prouoſt of Paris / and by that tyme that
he came it was clere day lyght. than the kyng
cōmaunded hym and ſayd / Prouoſt get you
men togyther well horſed / and purſewe that
traytour ſir Peter of Craon / who thus traytorouſly
hath hurte nygh to the dethe our conſtable / 
ye can nat do to vs a more acceptable
ſeruyce thanne to purſewe and take hym and
bring hym to vs. Than the prouoſt anſwered
and ſayd / ſyr I ſhall do all yt lyeth in my puyſſaunce
to do. Syr canne your grace knowe
whiche waye he is gone. Enquyre quod the
kynge and do your dylygence.
         
         
            ¶Howe in great dylygence the prouoſt
of Parys purſewed ſyr Peter of
Craon. Cap. C.lxxxvi.
            
               
               AS at that tyme the four ſouerayne
gates of the cytie were
euer kepte opyn nyght and day
whiche ordynaunce was made
euerſythe the batayle of Roſebeque / 
where the Frenche kyng diſconfited the

                  ••
               mynges / and that the pariſyēce wolde haue
rebelled / and that the malettes were laide
downe / to the entent to kepe vnder the pariſyence.
and by the counſayle of ſir Olyuer of
Clyſſon / all the chaynes in the ſtreates were
layde downe / and the gates taken of their hokes.
In this caſe the cytie was in a ten yere / 
ſo that euery man myght entre night or daye
in to Parys who ſo lyſt. Lo / it maye be well
conſydred what fortune is. The cōſtable gadred
the rodde wherwith hym ſelfe was beaten / 
for if the gates of Parys had ben cloſed
and the chaynes lyfte vp / ſir Peter of Craon
durſt neuer haue done that he dyde / for if he
had 
                  •
                he coude nat haue gone out of the towne
as he dyde. But bycauſe he knewe well he
might iſſue out at all houres / that made him
execute his yuell purpoſe. Wha he departed
fro the Conſtable / he thought ſurely he had
ben ſlayne / howe be it he was nat / wherwith
he was ſore diſpleaſed. Whan he iſſue out of
Parys / it was about one of the clocke after
mydnight / and paſſed by the gate ſaynt Anthony.
And ſome ſayd he paſſed the ryuer of
Seyne at the bridge of Charenton / & than
toke the waye to Charters / and ſome ſayde
he iſſued out of Parys at the gate of ſaynte
Honour / vnder Mount marter: and paſſed
the ryuer of Seyne at Ponthieur. Where ſo
euer he paſſed / he was by eight of the clocke
at Charters / and ſuche as were well horſed
with hym / all folowed hym nat / but brake a
ſondre for leſſe ſuſpeciouſneſſe / and for feare
of purſute. And whan this ſir Peter of Craon
came firſt to Parys / he had lefte at Charters
with one of the chanons there / who had
ben a ſeruaunt of his beforetyme / a twentte
freſſhe horſes. It had ben better for the chanon
he had neuer knowen hym / how be it of
his purpoſe nor of the executynge therof / he
knewe nothyng therin. Whan ſir Peter was
retourned to Charters / he dranke and chaū
               ged
his horſes and dyde of his harneſſe / and
toke the waye to Mayne / and rode ſo faſt / yt
he came to a caſtell of his owne called Sable / 
and there reſted hym ſelfe / and ſayde he
wolde go no further / tyll he herde tidynges
of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / and howe the mater
went. ye maye be ſure that the ſame fryday
after the dede was done / great brute ran
all about the cytie of that dede / & many blamed
greatly ſir Peter of Craon. The lorde
of Coucy as ſoone as he knewe therof in the
mornynge lepte on his horſe with eyght perſons
with hym / and rode to the Conſtables
lodgyng to viſyte hym / for they loued entierlye
togyder / and called eche other brother in
armes / his viſytacion dyd the Cōſtable gret
good. In lyke maner other lordes acordyng
to their tourne came and viſyted hym / & ſpecially
the duke of Thourayne who was ſore
diſpleaſed for that dede. And the kynge and
he ſayd bothe / howe that ſir Peter of Craon
had done that dede in diſpyte of theym / and
howe it was a thyng prepenſed by falſe traytours / 
to put the realme to trouble. The duke
of Berrey / who was than̄e was at Parys / 
diſſymuled the mater and made no great buſyneſſe
in the cauſe. And I ſir Iohan Froiſſarte
auctour of this cronycle / as I was credably
enformed of this aduenture / there had
ben nothyng done / if the duke of Berrey had
lyſte. for if he had wolde / he myght well haue
broken that enterpriſe / I ſhall ſhewe you
the reaſon howe.
            THe ſame thurſday of Corpus Chriſty
day / there came to the duke of Berrey
a clerke / ſecretorie to ſir Peter
of Craon / and ſayde to hym in ſecrete maner.
ſir / I wyll ſhewe you a thyng in ſecretneſſe / 
whiche is lykely to come to a poore cō
               cluſyon.
And ſir / ye are more lykely to remedye
it than any other. What mater is that ꝙ
the duke. Sir quod he I ſhall ſhewe you / 
but I wolde nat be named the bringer oute
therof. Spare nat quod the duke / I ſhall
beare out the mater well ynoughe. Well ſir
quod the Clerke / I doubte me greatlye that
ſir Peter of Craon wyll ſlee or cauſe to be
murthered / the conſtable ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
for he hath aſſembled toguyder in to his
houſe / within the Churche yarde of ſaynte
Iohanes / a great noumbre of menne / and
hath kepte them there couertly / euerſyth the
feeſt of Whitſontyde. And ſir / if they ſhulde
do that dede the kynge wyll be ſore dyſpleapleaſed

/ and bringe the Realme in to great
trouble / therfore ſir I ſhewe it to you. for ſir
I am abaſſhed therof my ſelfe / though I be
ſir Peters ſeruaunt / and haue made ſeruyce
to hym / yet I dare nat conſente to this outrage.
And ſir / and ye prouyde nat for the mater / 
there is none can do it. And ſir / for goddeſſake
take hede to this that I haue ſhewed
you. And ſir / to eſchewe that maye falle I
dare nat retourne to hym. The duke herde
hym well and ſaid. Abyde here with me this
nyght / and to morowe by tymes I ſhall enforme
the kyng therof. It is nowe farforthe
dayes / I wyll nat trouble the kynge therwith / 
but to morowe without faute we ſhall
prouyde for the mater / ſithe that ſir Peter of
Craon is in the towne / I knewe nat therof
before. Thus the duke draue of the matter / 
and in the meane tyme this myſchiefe felle.
Than the Prouoſt with mo than̄e threſcore
horſes iſſued oute of the cytie at the gate of
ſaynt Honour / and folowed the tracke of ſir
Peter of Craon / and came to Ponthieur to
paſſe the ryuer of Seyne / & demaūded of the
kepar of the bridge / if any horſes paſſed that
waye that mornynge / and he ſayd yes: howe
that there paſſed about a twelue horſe / but I
ſawe no knyght nor perſone that I knewe.
What waye toke they quod the Prouoſt? ſir
quod he the waye towardes Wannes. Ah ꝙ
the prouoſt it maye well be / I thynke they
wyll ryde to Chierbourge. Than̄e the prouoſte
tooke that waye and leſte the waye to
Charters / and therby the loſte the iuſte purſute
of ſir Peter of Craon. And whanne he
had rydden tyll noone / than he mette with a
knyght of the countrey who had been a huntyng
of the Hare / and he ſhewed hym howe
that he ſawe the ſame mornynge about a fyftene
men a horſebacke / trauerſyng the feldes
and (as he thought) toke the waye to Charters.
Than the prouoſt and his company entred
in to the waye to Charters / and ſo rode
tyll it was nere hande nyght / and than came
to Charters. And there it was ſhewed hym / 
howe ſir Peter of Craon hadde been there
with the chanon aboute eyght of the clocke / 
and there vnarmed hym and toke freſſhe horſes.
Than the prouoſt ſawe well he had loſt
his payne and ſhulde do to folowe hym any
further / Sayeng / ſeyng that he was ſo farre
paſt. Than the Saturdaye he retourned to
Parys / bycauſe the certentie / whiche waye
ſir Peter of Craon toke was nat knowen at
Parys. Therfore the kynge and the duke of
Thourayne who had a great affection to haue
ſir Peter of Craon taken / ſente ſir Iohn̄
of Barrois with a threſcore horſe out of Parys
to ſertche for hym. And they iſſued out at
the gate ſaynt Anthony / and paſſed the ryuers
of Marne and Scyne / at the bridge of
Charenton / and rode all about the countrey
and came towardes Eſtampes / and finally
at dyner they came to Charters / and there
herde ſure tidynges. And whan̄e the Barrois
knewe yt ſir Peter of Craon was gone / 
and ſawe that he ſhulde but traueyle in vayne / 
to folowe any further. Than he retourned
agayne the ſondaye to Parys / and ſhewed
the kyng what he had done / and in lykewiſe
ſo had the prouoſt done. The ſaturday
there was founde in a vyllage as they went
a ſertchyng two ſquyers and a page / parteynyng
to ſir Peter of Craon. They were taken
and brought to Parys and ſette in priſone / 
and on the Mondaye beheeded. Firſt
they were brought to ye place where the dede
was done / and there eche of them had their
right hande ſtriken of / and than to the halles
and there beheeded and hanged on the gybet
and the wedniſday after the kepar of ſir Peter
of Craons houſe in Paris was executed
and beheeded. many men ſaid he had wrong
But bycauſe he ſhewed nat the cōmynge of
ſir Peter in to Parys / he was put to dethe.
in lykewiſe yt chanon at Charters with whō
ſir Peter dyde refreſſhe hym and chaunged
his horſe / he was accuſed and taken and put
in the byſſhoppes priſone / and toke fro hym
all that he had / and depriued hym of all his
benefyces / and was condempned to perpetuall
priſone / to lyue with breed and water / all
the excuſacyons that he coude make auayled
hym nothyng. He was reputed in the towne
of Charters to be a noble wyſe man. ſir Peter
of Craon beyng in his caſtell of Sable / 
was ſore diſpleaſed whan he knewe that ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon was nat deed / nor had no
hurte / but that within ſixe wekes he ſhulde
be hole. Than he conſydred that he was nat
in good ſuretie in that Caſtell / and feared
to be encloſed / in ſuche wyſe / that he ſhulde
nat iſſue whan he wolde. Than̄e he tooke a
certayne with hym & iſſued out ſecretly / and

rode ſo longe that he came in to Bretaygne / 
and there foūde the duke / who receyued hym
and knewe all the mater / and howe the Conſtable
was nat deed: Than he ſayde. Ah ſir
Peter of Craon ye are vnhappy / that coude
nat ſlee the Conſtable / whan ye had hym vnder
youre handes. Sir quod ſir Peter / the
deuyll was on it. I thynke all the deuylles
in hell dyde helde hym out of my hādes / and
out of my companyons. I am ſure there was
ſtryken at hym mo thanne threſcore ſtrokes / 
with ſwordes and iauelyns. And whan̄e he
fell fro his horſe / in dede I thought ſurely he
had bene deed: and ſo he had been / and it had
nat ben his fortune to fall in at a bakers dore
the whiche ſtode halfe opyn / for if he had fallen
in the ſtrete he hadde neuer ryſen a lyue.
Well quod the duke / as nowe it wyll be none
otherwyſe / I am ſure I ſhall here ſhortely

I ſhall haue warre with hym (as ye haue).
Kepe you priuely with me ye mater ſhall nat

and ſuſteyne you I wyll kepe promyſe.

bycauſe he ſuſteyned ſir Peter of craon:
and howe in that viage the kynge
fell ſicke / wherby the viage brake
Cap. C.lxxxvii.
            
               TIdynges came to the
Frenche kynge as he laye
at Parys / that the duke of
Bretayne hadde receyued
ſir Peter of Craon. than
the kyng was counſayled
by ſuche as were of his priuye
Counſayle / that he ſhulde incontynent
ſende in to Bretaygne to the duke / cōmaundynge
hym on his faythe and homage / that
he ought to the crowne of Fraunce / to take
the traytour ſir Peter of Craon and to ſende
hym to Parys. Theſe letters were written / 
ſealed and delyuered to a ſquiet / and he rode
ſo long that he came in to Bretayne / & foūde
the duke at his caſtell of Ermyne / and there
delyuered his letters. The duke toke & reed
them. Than he ſaid to the meſſanger that he
wolde write agayne to the kyng / and ſo dyd
in excuſyng of hymſelfe: Sayeng that as of
ſir Peter of Craon he knewe nothynge / nor
where he was / nor wolde nat knowe / nor it
aparteyned nat to hym to knowe: Nor as
for the hatered nor warre that was bytwene
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon and ſir Peter of craon
he toke no regarde therto / for it touched him
nothynge. And therfore in thoſe maters / he
prayed the kyng to holde hym excuſed. This
letter was ſealed & delyuered to the kynges
meſſanger / & ſo he retourned agayne to Parys / 
and there foūde the kyng & his coūſayle
who were ſore deſyrous to here tidinges out
of Bretaygne. Than the meſſanger delyuered
his letters to the kynge who toke & reed
them. Than the kynge ſayd to his brother &
to his counſayle. This excuſacion of the dukes
is nat ſuffycient. It ſemeth well the duke
of Bretayne hath cauſed all this buſynes
This diſpyre and outrage is ſo great / that
it ought nat to be ſuffred / for it toucheth gretlye
myne honoure. The ſame ſeaſon the duke
of Berrey was at Parys / and often tymes
the kynge wolde ſpeke to hym of this
treſpaſſe / and the duke ſayd. Sir / ſurely he
hath done a great outrage: if he myght be
founde / it were reaſone he made amendes.
Fayre vncle quod the kynge / he is in Bretaygne
with the duke. We wyll go and ſeke
hym there / and ye ſhall go with vs. The duke
diſſymuled the mater and ſayd. Sir / as
it ſhall pleaſe you / but ye muſt haue alſo my
brother of Burgoyne with you. We wyll haue
hym with vs quod the kyng / for without
hym we wyll make no voyage. We wyll go
in to Bretayne with ſuche an armye / able to
reſyſt all our ennemyes. We maye ſe nowe
openly / that this duke loueth nor ſetteth by
vs but lytell: He is proude and preſumptuous / 
and we ſhall entende to nothynge / tyll
we haue brought hym to reaſone. Thus the
Frenche kyng deuiſed with the duke of Berrey / 
and manyſſhed greatly the duke of Bretayne
and his aſſyſters. The duke of Berrey
acorded to all his ſayeng / but he diſſymuled / 
for he thought the contrary.
            
               
THe Frenche kyng hadde great affection
to be reuenged / of the diſpyte
that was done to his cōſtable / wherfore
he prepared hym ſelfe to go in to Bretayne / 
and fyrſt to go in to Aniou to diſtroye
and beate downe ſir Peter of Craons caſtel
les / for all that the duke of Bretayne ſayd he
had bought them. yet the kyng and his counſayle
ſayd it was no poynt of the dukes heritage
but that the duke ſayde ſo to excuſe and
to ſuſteyne ſir Peter of Craon / wherfore perſonally
he was in the kynges indignacyon.
yet in the ſame ſeaſon a treatie of maryage
was had bytwene the duke of Bretaygnes
ſon̄e and the kynges doughter.
            IN the meane ſeaſon whyle this voyage
was thus ordred / & great brute
therof ſpoken throughe all Frauce.
There retourned to Paris the byſſhoppe of
Noyon and the lorde de la Ryuer fro Foize
and Bierne / and there ſhewed the kyng and
his counſayle howe they had ſpedde. They
were well herde / but the voyage in to Bretayne
buſyed ſo the kyng and his counſayle / 
that they had no leyſar to entēde to any other
mater. And the kynge wolde gladly that the
conſtable had ben hole / that he might be able
to ryde. and or the kyng went fro Parys / he
cōmaunded to be beaten downe ſir Peter of
Craōs houſe / that ſtode in the churche yarde
of ſaynt Iohans / and than the kynge dyde
gyue the groūde to make a churche yarde of
to burye in deed bodyes. The Frenche kyng
made his prouiſyon in the waye to Aniou / to
Mayne / to Bretayne / and in to Thourayne
on the ryuer of Loyre / to the entent to go in
to Bretayne / none durſt ſpeke the contrary.
            REnome was throughout all Paris
and (it was well knowen) that ſir
Olyuer of Cliſſon cōſtable of Fraū
               ce / 
whan he laye thus ſicke of his hurtꝭ made
his teſtament / to the entente that his heyres
ſhulde knowe ye trouthe of euery thyng that
he had / and where it was. His heyres were
two doughters / the one was maryed to Iohan
of Bretayne erle of Ponthieur. It was
he that ſir Olyuer had quytte out of priſone
in Englāde / and payde for hym ſixſcore thou
ſande frankes to the duke of Irelande / as it
hath ben ſhewed here before in this hyſtorie.
And his ſeconde doughter was or ſhulde be
vicoūtes of Rohan by reaſon of her huſbāde
The ſomme of the teſtament mounted to the
ſōme of ſeuyntene hundred thouſande frankes
beſyde his heritage. Euery man yt herde
therof had great marueyle / howe he ſhulde
gather toguider / ſuche richeſſe / and ſpecially
the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne / & their
counſayls / had great marueyle therof / and
ſpake largely & ſayd. What the deuyll howe
maye it be that the conſtable hath gadered to
guider ſo many floreyns / and ſuche mouable
goodes? the kyng hym ſelfe hath nat ſo moche.
It maye well be beleued and knowen / 
that he hath nat won all this by no iuſt meanes.
Thus the mater paſſed / but ſuche as loued
hym nat thought neuertheleſſe. Thus
all ſuche as the kynge had written vnto prepared
them ſelfe to go with hym in to Bretaygne.
This voiage pleaſed nothynge the
duke of Burgoyn / he ſayd this was a warre
without reaſon / and that the concluſion ther
of coulde take no good ende / nor the realme
of Fraunce / nor the duchy of Bretayne / nor
the lordes / knightes and ſquyers / in thē had
nothynge to do with the warre bytwene ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon and ſir Peter of Craon.
What nede they quod he to take payne or traueyle
to make warre in their quarelles? We
ſhulde rather ſuffre them and their owne mē
to greue and make warre eche vpon other.
The duke of Berrey was of the ſame opinyon / 
but they coude nat be herde nor beleued / 
for the kyng was coūſayled contrary to their
opinyons / by ſuche as the kyng loued better
than them. Theſe dukes coude nat tell howe
to breke that enterprice / and whan they ſawe
none other remedy / they obeyed / But that
was ſlouthfully / howe be it by the promocyon
of the duke of Burgoyne / the erle of
Oſtrenaunt was written vnto by the kynge
to go with hym in this iourney with thre hū
               dred
ſpeares. The erle who loued dedes of
armes prouyded hym to go with the kynge / 
and whan̄e he was redy / and had aſſembled
toguyder his company to his great coſt and
charge. Than he was countermaunded
agayne / and that in no
wyſe he ſhulde
ſtyrre.

            ¶Howe the duke of Thourayn brother
to the kyng reſigned the duchy
of Thourayne in to the kynges handes:
and howe by exchaūge the kynge
gaue hym the duchy of Orlyaūce
and ſo euer after he was called duke
of Orlyaunce. Cap. C.lxxxvii.
            
               IN the ſame ſeaſon that
the kyng was thus nighe
redy to departe out of Parys / 
to ſhewe that he toke
that buſyneſſe / as to hym
ſelfe / there was an exchaū
               ge
made of landes gretly
to the profyte of the duke of Thourayne / for
he reſygned in to the kynges handes the duchy
of Thourayne / and the kyng gaue hym
the duchy of Orliaunce / in lyke maner as aū
               ciently
duke Philyp of Orlyaunce helde it / 
whiche was four tymes better in value than
the other was. ſo thus fro henſ forthe in this
hyſtorie I ſhall name hym that was duke of
Thourayne duke of Orlyaūce. ¶Whan ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon was all hole and that he
might ryde / the Frenche kyng was right ioyfull
and ſaid: howe he wolde tary no lengar
and ſo on an euenyng he toke his leaue of the
quene Iſabell his wyfe / and of the newe ducheſſe
of Orlyaunce / and of all other ladyes
and damoſelles / and ſo dyde the duke of Orlaūce
in lykewiſe. Than they departed and
rode to ſupper to Mōtague / and the duke of
Burbone / the erle of Namure / and the lorde
of Coucy with hym. There the kyng laye &
dyned there / & after dyner they departed and
laye all night at ſaynt Germayns / and there
laye a ſeuyn dayes. and as than ye kyng was
ſomwhat diſeaſed / and his phiſicions wolde
haue had hym to haue reſted hym ſelfe / but ye
kyng was ſo wyllyng in his iourney / that he
ſayde howe he was moche better at his eaſe / 
than he was in dede / whiche he dyde to gyue
corage to his men to ſet forwarde / for as thā
his two vncles / the dukes of Berrey & Burgoyne
were behynde / & ſhewed well by their
maner / that the ſame iourney greued them / 
nor they wolde nat haue gone by their good
wylles / howe be it they hadde made their aſſemble
and to ſaue their honour they obeyed
and folowed.
            WHan the Frenche kyng hadde reſted
hym a fyftene dayes at ſaynt Germayns / 
and that his armye was aſſembled / 
than he departed and paſſed the ryuer
of Seyne / and toke the waye to Charters / 
and ſo to Annens / a good towne and a
caſtell / parteyning to the lorde de la Ryuer / 
as herytage of his wyues. With the kynge
was his brother the duke of Orlyaunce and
the duke of Burbone. The lorde de la Ryreceyued
the kynge honorably / and there taryed
thre dayes / and than rode to Charters
where as Montague was byſſhoppe. The
kynge was lodged in the byſſhoppe palais
and the two dukes. And the ſeconde day after
thyder came the duke of Berrey and the
erle of Marche in his cōpany. And the fourh
daye thider cāe the duke of Burgoyne / wher
of the kynge was ryght ioyfull / and people
came dayle / and the kyng ſayd he wolde nat
retourne to Parys tyll he hadde brought the
duke of Bretayne to reaſon / who ſo often tymes
had put hym to payne and trouble. The
kynges counſayle hadde ſo ſette hym on that
warre / that the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne
wolde gladly haue modered ye mater / 
but they coulde nat be herde / wherwith they
were ſore diſpleaſed / & ſo were ſuche as were
of their coūſayls: and they ſaid eche to other
that ſurely the mater coude nat long endure
in that ſtate / for it is full lykely that the kynge
and the realme ſhall haue ſome buſyneſſe
to do / ſithe the kyng refuſeth the counſaile of
his vncles / and leaneth to other at his pleaſure / 
who be nothyng lyke to thē. Whan the
kyng had taried at Charters a ſeuyn dayes / 
than he departed and toke ye waye to Mans
and his men folowed / ſome fro farre partes / 
as out of Arthois / Beamoys / Vermandois / 
and Picardy: and ſome ſaid one to another.
Ah / this duke of Bretayne maketh vs to haue
moche to do / & putteth vs to great payne
and traueyle. He hath been alwayes harde &
highe herted agaynſt the crowne of Fraūce / 
nor he neuer loued nor honored it. And his
coſyn the erle of Flaunders and the ducheſſe
of Burgone (who haue alwayes borne hym
and as yet do) had nat ben / he had ben diſtroyed
long a go / for euerſyth the lorde Clyſſon

tourned Frenche / he neuer loued him. Surelye

of Craon agaynſt the kyng and agaynſt
the Conſtable. Than other ſayde. Lette the
kyng alone / for as at this tyme he hath ye mater
ſo at his hert / that he wyll bring the duke
to reaſon or he retourne. That is trewe ꝙ other
if there be no trayſon. But we feare that
all ſuche as go with the kyng be nat enemies
to ye duke / as it may be well 
                  〈◊〉
                (if we durſt
ſpeke it) by ſome tokens. For there be ſome
that nyght and daye do what they can to coū
               ſayle
the kynge to breke his voyage / whiche
ſo troubleth the kyng that he can ſcant gette
hym ſelfe any helthe or recouery of his laſte
ſickeneſſe. Thus knightes and ſquiers deuiſed
among thē ſelfe as they rode in their coū
               treys.
Styll the kyng aproched to the cytie
of Mans / and there the kynge lodged in the
caſtell and his lordes in ye cytie / and his men
of warre abrode in the countrey. There the
kyng taried a thre wickes / for he was ſore vexed
with the feuer: and his phiſicions ſayde
to his brother and to his vncles. My lordes
we enſure you ye do yuell to traueyle ye kyng
for he is in no good ſtate to ryde / reſt were
farre better for hym / for ſythe he came fro the
cytie of Amyens / he hath nat ben in ſo good
helthe / as he was before. They ſhewed this
to the kynge but he had ſo great affection to
go in this iourney / that he wolde nother beleue
them nor yet his phiſycions / but ſayde.
howe he founde more eaſe in trauelyng than
in reſtyng. Therfore who ſo euer counſayle
me the contrary ſhall nat pleaſe me / nor he loueth
me nat. Other anſwere they coulde nat
haue of the kyng. Euery day the kyng wolde
ſytte in the myddes of his counſayle / tyll it
was noon / to thentent that none ſhulde laye
any lette of his iourney. Thus the kyng being
at Mans / and ſomwhat to acomplyſſhe
the deſyers of his vncles. He ſent four notable
knightes to the duke of Bretayne / as ſir
Raynolde du Roy / the lorde of Varenſiers / 
the lorde of Caſtell morant / and ſir Tāpyne
of Cauten
                  •
               l chateleyne of Gyſors / and they
were charged to ſhewe the duke / howe the
kyng and his counſaile reputed that he dyde
great offence / to ſuſteyne the kynges enemy
and the realmes / and to make amendes / that
he ſhulde ſēde ſir Peter of Craon to Mans
to the kyng / wherby meanes ſhulde be foūde
that he ſhulde take no dōmage / nor his countrey / 
for all the kynges voyage. Thus they
deꝑted fro Mans with a .xl. ſperes / & paſſed
through the cyte of Angiers and at laſt came
before the cytie of Nauntes / and entred / and
there ſounde the duke who made them good
chere / and on a daye made them a dyner / and
than they dyde their meſſage and declared ye
kynges entent and his counſayls / whervnto
the duke anſwered wiſely and ſagely / & ſaid
Howe it ſhulde be harde for hym to delyuer
ſir Peter of Craon / and ſayd as god myght
helpe hym in all his buſyneſſe / he knewe nat
where he was. Wherfore he deſyred them in
that caſe to holde hym excuſed / But he ſayde
he had well herde of hym a yere paſt / that he
loued nat ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / but wolde
make him mortall warre to his power / what
ſoeuer ende came therof. And at that tyme I
demaunded of hym if he had gyuen ſir Olyuer
knowledge therof / and he ſayd he had vtterly
defyed and wolde ſlee hym if he coude / 
outher by daye or by nyght / where ſoeuer he
coude fynde hym. Of his dedes I knowe no
further / wherfore I haue marueyle that the
kynge wyll make warre agaynſt me for his
cauſe. for as to the couynauntes of maryage
bytwene our chyldren by the grace of God / 
ſhall nat be broken on my parte / wherfore I
haue done nothynge to hym nor to his counſaile / 
that he ſhulde make warre agaynſt me
This was the aunſwere that the duke made
to the Frenche kynges meſſangers / and ſo
whan they hadde taryed a daye at Nauntes / 
than they toke their leaue and departed and
retourned to Mans to ye kyng / who thought
longe tyll he herde their aunſwere / and as ye
haue herde before: they declared it to ye kyng
and his coūſayle. The dukes of Berrey & of
Burgoyne were well cōtent with ye anſwere
and ſayd it was reaſonable / but the kyng by
reaſon of ſuche enformacion as he had ſayde
the contrary: and ſayd ſithe he was ſo forewarde
in his iourney / he wolde nat returne
agayne in to Fraunce nor to Parys / tyll he
had brought the duke of Bretayne to reaſon
Gladly the two dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
wolde haue modered that voiage / but
they might nat be herde / for the kyng had taken
ſuche diſpleaſure with the duke of Bretayn / 
bicauſe he ſuſteyned ſir Peter of craon

that no excuſacion coulde be taken. The ſame
tyme a brute ranne in Fraunce / that the quene
of Aragon my lady yolant of Bare / coſyn germayne
to the frenche kynge / had in priſon in
the cytie of Barcylona / a knyght that no man
knewe his name / men ſuppoſed it had ben ſyr
Peter of Craon. this quene had writen right
amyably to the kynge / ſygnyfyenge hym that
the fyfte day of the moneth of Iuly / a knyght
in good eſtate and aray came to Barcylona / 
to haue paſt the ſce / and had hyred for his money
a ſhyppe (as he ſayd) to haue ſayled in to
Napoles / and bycauſe we kepe our paſſages
that no ſtraunger ſhall paſſe without he be
knowen what he is / and this knyght wyll nat
ſhewe his name / therfore we kepe hym in priſone / 
& by the abaſſhment that we ſe in him / we
thynke ſurely it be the ſame perſon ye wold ſo
fayne haue. Therfore we write to you therof / 
that ye ſhulde ſende ſome perſon hyther / ſuche
as knoweth ſir Peter of Craon / to ſe if it be he
or nat / for what ſo euer he be he ſhall nat be delyuered
tyll we haue aunſwere fro you / and I
wolde that theſe tydynges might be agreable
to you and to your counſayle / as knoweth the
holy gooſt / who preſerue you. Writen at Parpygnan
the nynth day of Iuly / by yolante of
Bare / quene of Aragon and of Maiolles / and
lady Sardyne & Sardane. And on the ſuper
ſcrypcion / to the redouted kynge of Fraunce.
            THeſe tydynges ſomewhat modered
dyuers mennes hartes / ſo that they
were nere at the poynte to haue broken
their voyage / howe be it ſuche as were ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſons frendes ſayde / that thoſe
tydynges were but fayned tales / made and deuyſed
to breke the kynges voyage / ſayenge
that ſir Peter of Craon was in none other priſoneꝭ
but with the duke of Bretayne / who hath
ſuſteyned hym and dothe. Of the quene of Aragons
lettre the kynge made but lyght / ſayenge
it was but trayſon and fables. Than the
duke of Burgoyne ſayd. Syr yet at leſte to a
peaſe my neſe the quene of Aragon / and for
the delyueraunce of the knight that is there in
priſone / who petaduenture is nothynge gylty
of this treſpas / ſende vnto her that ſhe may be
contente with you and with vs. I am content
therwith quod the kynge to pleaſe you / but I
beleue ſurely the traytour ſyr Peter of Craon
is in none other Barcylona nor priſone / but aboute
the duke of Bretayne / and by my faythe
that I owe to ſaint Denyce / he ſhall ones make
acompt therof. There coulde no man turne
the kynge fro the opinyon / but that ſyr Peter
of Craon was with the duke of Bretaygne.
The duke of Bretayne who was well enfourmed
of all this buſyneſſe / thought hymſelfe
nat well aſſured / for he ſawe well the dukes of
Berrey and Burgoyne coulde nat bring their
purpoſe aboute / for ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſons
frendes led the kynge as they lyſte. Than the
duke prouyded for to kepe his townes and garyſons / 
howe be it he durſt kepe no towne except
Wannes / Campell / Doll / Camper / Lermyn / 
Corātyne / and Suſement / and he wrote
to ſuche knyghtes and ſquyers as he thought
ſhulde ayde him / but they all diſſymuled with
hym / bycauſe they knewe that the french kyng
was ſo ſore diſpleaſed with hym / and alſo they
thought it was nat a thynge couenable for the
duke to ſuſteyne ſyr Peter of Craon agaynſt
the conſtable of Fraūce / as he dyd. The duke
in a maner repented hym that he had done ſo
moche / howe be it his corage and herte was ſo
hygh that he dyſdayned to ſpeke it / but ſayde
if the kynge came in to Bretayne / as it ſemed
he wolde do / at the begynnynge he wolde let
hym a lone / and thanne ſhall I ſe who be my
frendes or foos / I wyll nat be to haſty to make
him warre / and whan he weneth to be at moſt
reſt / than wyll I awake hym if I can nat be a
greed with hym by loue. Thus the duke deuyſed
ſomtyme with his counſayle / and thought
ſurely he ſhulde haue warre / howe be it he had
nat / for the maters tourned otherwyſe to his
great aduauntage. therfore it is an olde prouerbe / 
he is nat poore yt is happy. This duke
was fortunate / by reaſon of apytuous incydence
that fell ſodaynly on the frenche kynge / 
for otherwyſe the duke was nat lykely to haue
ſcaped all daūgers / and to haue lyued in peace
as he dyd.
            WHan the Frenche kynge had taryed
the ſpace of thre wekes in the cytie of
Mans / and the knyghtes retourned
that he had ſent in to Bretayne. Than he ſayd
ſyth he had herde the dukes anſwere he wolde
no lenger tary there / for he ſayd the taryenge
there greatly diſpleaſed him / and wolde paſſe
forthe in to Bretaygne to ſe his enemys / that
was the duke of Bretaygne / who ſuſteyd the

traytour ſyr Peter of Craon. The entencyon
of the kynge was / that if any knyghtes and
ſquyers came agaynſt hym / or that he founde
any townes cloſed he wolde put downe ye duke
for euer / and ſet a gouernour in the countrey
tyll the dukes chyldren were of lawfull age / 
and than rendre to them the berytage / and the
duke neuer to haue any parte theof. This opinyon
the king helde ſtyll and no man coude
put hym therfro. and thus on a fayre daye aboute
ten of the clocke the kynge departed fro
the cytie of Mans / and had cōmaunded his
marſhalles the nyght before to cauſe all his at
mye bothe before and behynde to dyſloge and
to drawe to Angers / and ſayde that he wolde
nat retourne tyll he had ben in Bretayne and
dyſtroyed the traytours that had put hym to
ſo moche payne and trouble. The marſhalles
dyd the kinges cōmaundement. The day that
the king departed was marueylous hoote / for
me ſonne as than naturally was in his cheife
force / and to the entent to declare the trouth of
euery thyng. The ſame ſeaſon that the kynge
lay at Mans / he was ſore traueyled with dayly
ſyttynge in counſayle / and alſo he was nat
perfytely hole nor had nat ben all that ſeaſon / 
he was feble in his brayne and heed / and dyd
eate or drinke but lytell / and nygh dayly was
in a hoote feuer / ſo that he was gretly anoyed
and payned / and alſo for the dyſpleaſure that
he had for the conſtables hurte / he was full of
malencoly and his ſpirytes ſore troubled and
traueyled / and that his phyſicions ſpyed well
and ſo dyd his vncles / but they coulde nat remedy
it / for no man durſte counſayle hym to
breke his voyage in to Bretaygne. And as it
was enfourmed me / as he rode forwarde in
the foreſt of Mans / a great ſygnifycacyon fell
to hym / by the whiche if he had doone well he
ſhulde haue called his counſayle aboute hym
and well aduyſed hymſelfe or he had gone any
further. Sodaynly there came to the kynge a
poore man bare heeded / bare legged / and bare
footed / and on his body a poore whyte cote / 
he ſemed rather to be a foole than wyſe / and
boldely ſodaynly he toke the brydell of the kynges
horſe in his handes and ſtopped the horſe
and ſayd. Syr kyng tyde no further forward
for thou arte betrayed. Thoſe wordes entred
into the kynges heed / wherby he was worſe
dyſpoſed in his helthe than he was before / ſo
that his herte & his blode was moued. Than
the kinges ſeruauntes ſtrake ſo the poore man
that he lette the kynges horſe go / and made no
more of his wordes than of a fooles ſpekyng / 
whiche was foly as dyuers men ſayde / for at
the leſte they ſhulde haue better examyned the
man / and to haue ſene if he had ben a naturall
foole or no / and to haue knowen fro whence he
came / but they dyde nat ſo / but lefte hym behynde / 
& he was neuer ſene after to any mannes
knowledge / but ſuche as were nere to the
Kynge herde hym ſpeke theſe wordes. The
kynge paſſed forthe / and aboute twelue of the
clocke the kynge paſſed out of the foreſt / and
came in to a great playne all ſandy. the ſonne
alſo was in his heyght & ſhone bright / whoſe
rayes were marueylouſly hote / wherby the
horſes were ſore chafed / and all ſuche perſons
as were armed were ſore oppreſſed with heat.
The knyghtes rode togyther by companyes / 
ſome here and ſome there / and the kynge rode
ſomwhat a parte bycauſe of the duſte / and the
duke of Berrey and the Duke of Burgoyne
rode on his lefte hande talkynge togyther / an
acre brede of lande of fro the kynge. Other lordes
as the erle of Marche / ſir Iaques of Burbone / 
ſyr Charles de la Brethe / ſyr Phylyppe
Darthoys / ſir Henry and ſir Phylip of Bare
ſyr Peter of Nauer and other knyghtes rode
by companyes. the duke of Burbon / the lorde
Coucy / ſyr Charles Dangers / the baron Dyuiry
& dyuers other rode on before the kynge / 
and nat in his company / and they deuiſed and
talked togyther / and toke no hede of that fell
ſodaynly on the chefe perſonage of the company / 
whiche was on the kynges owne perſone / 
therfore the workes of god are marueylous / 
and his ſcourges are cruell and are to be douted
of all creatures. There hath been ſene in
the olde teſtament and alſo in the newe / many
fygures and examples therof. We rede howe
Nabugodonoſor kynge of Aſſyryens / who
reygned a ſeaſon in ſuche tryumphant glory / 
that there was none lyke hym / and ſodaynly
in his greateſt force and glory / the ſouerayne
kynge out lorde god kynge of Heuen and of
erthe / fourmer and ordeyner of all thynges / a
parelled this ſayd kynge in ſuche wyſe that he
loſt his wytte and reygne and was ſeuen yers
in that eſtate / and lyued by acornes and maſt
that fell fro the Okes / and other wylde appels
and frutes / and hadde taſt but as a bore or a
ſwyne. and after he had endured this penaūce

god reſtored hym agayne to his memory and
wytte. And than he ſayde to Danyell the prophet / 
that there was none other god / but the
god of Iſraell. Nowe the father / the ſonne / 
and the holy gooſt / thre perſones in one god / 
hath ben / is / and euer ſhall be as puiſſaunt to
ſhewe his warkes as euer he was / wherfore
no man ſhulde marueyle of any thyng that he
dothe. Nowe to the purpoſe why I ſpeke all
theſe wordes. A great influence fro heuen fell
the ſayd daye vpon the frenche kynge / and as
dyuers ſayd / it was his owne faute / for acordynge
to the dyſpoſicyon of his body / and the
ſtate that he was in / and the warnyng that his
phyſicyons dyd gyue hym / he ſhulde nat haue
rydden in ſuche a hoote day / at that houre / but
rather in the mornynge and in the euenynge
in the freſſhe ayre / wherfore it was a ſhame to
them that were nere aboute hym / to ſuffre or
to coūſayle hym to do as he dyd. Thus as the
frenche kynge rode vpon a fayre playne in the
heate of the Sonne / whiche was as than of a
marueylous heyght / and the kynge had on a

                  •
               ac
                  •
               e couered with blacke veluet / whiche ſore
chafed hym / and on his heed a ſyngle bonet of
ſcarlet / and a chapelet of great perles / whiche
the quene had gyuen hym at his departure / 
and he had a page that rode behynde him / beatynge
on his heed a chapewe of Montaban / 
bright and clere ſhynynge agaynſt the ſonne / 
and behynde that page rode a nother bearing
the kynges ſpeare / paynted redde / and frynged
with ſylke / with a ſharpe heed of ſtele / the
lord de la Ryuer had brought a doſyn of them
with hym fro Tholouſe / and that was one of
them he had gyuen the hole doſyn to the king / 
and the kynge had gyuen thre of theym to his
brother the duke of Orlyaunce / and thre to the
duke of Burbon. And as they rode thus forth
the page that bare the ſpeare / whether it were
by neclygence or that he fell a ſlepe / he lette the
ſpeare fall on the other pages heed that rode
before hym / and the heed of the ſpeare made
a great claſſhe on the bright chapewe of ſtele.
The kynge (who rode but a fore them) with
the noyſe ſodaynly ſtarted / and his herte trymbled / 
and in to his imagynacion ranne the inpreſſyon
of the wordes of the man that ſtopped
his horſe in the foreſt of Mans / and it ran
in to his thought / that his enemyes ranne after
hym to ſlee and diſtroy him / and with that
abuſyon he fell out of his wytte by febleneſſe
of his heed / & daſſhed his ſpores to his horſe / 
and drewe out he ſworde / and tourned to his
pages / hauynge no knowledge of any man / 
wenynge in hymſelfe to be in a batayle incloſed
with his enemyes / and lyfte vp his ſworde
to ſtryke he cared nat where / and cryed and
ſayd. On on vpon theſe traytours. Whan the
pages ſawe the kynge ſo inflamed with Ire / 
they tooke good hede to themſelfe / as it was
tyme. They thought the kynge had ben dyſpleaſed
bycauſe the ſpeare fell downe / thanne
they ſtepte away fro the kynge. The duke of
Orleaunce was nat as than̄e farre of fro the
kynge. The kynge came to hym with his naked
ſworde in his hande. The kynge was as
than in ſuche a franſey / and his herte ſo feble / 
that he nother knewe brother nor vncle. Whan
the duke of Orlyaunce ſawe the kynge commynge
on hym with his ſworde naked in his
ha
                  •
               de 
                  •
               he was abaſſhed and wolde nat abyde
hym / he wyſte nat what he mente / he daſſhed
his ſpurres to his horſe and rode awaye / and
the kynge after hym. The duke of Burgoyne
who rode a lytell waye of fro the kynge whan
he herde the ruſſhyng of the horſes / and herde
the pages crye / he regarded that waye / and
ſawe howe the kynge with his naked ſworde
chaſed his brother the duke of Orlyaunce / he
was ſore abaſſhed & ſayd. Out harowe what
myſchife is this / the kynge is nat in his ryght
mynde / god helpe hym. Flye away nephewe / 
flye away / for the kynge wolde ſlee you. The
duke of Orlyance was nat well aſſured of him
ſelfe / and fledde awaye as faſte as his horſe
myght beare hym / and knyghtes and ſquyers
folowed after / euery man began to drawe thyder.
Such as were farre of thought they had
chafed an hare or a wolfe / tyll at laſt they herd
that the Kynge was nat well in his mynde.
The duke of Orlyance ſaued himſelfe. Than
men of armes came all aboute the kynge / and
ſuffred hym to wery hym ſelfe / and the more
that he traueyled the febler he was / and whan
he ſtrake at any man / they wolde fall downe
before the ſtroke. At this matter there was no
hurte / but many ouerthrowen / for there was
none that made any defence. Fynally / whan
the kyng was well 
                  •
               eryed / and his horſe ſore
chafed with ſw
                  •
               te / and great heate / a knyght
of Normandy one of the kynges chamber 
                  •
               aynes / 
whome the kynge loued very well / called
Gyllyam Martell
                  •
                he came behynde the kyng

ſodaynely and tooke hym in his armes / and
helde hym ſtyll. Than all other aproched / and
toke the ſworde out of his handes / and tooke
hym downe fro his horſe and dyd of his 
                  •
               acke
thre refreſſhe hym. Than came his brother and
his 
                  〈◊〉
                vncles but he had clene loſt the knowledge
of them / and rolled his eyen in his heed
marueylouſly / and ſpake to no man. The lordes
of his blode were ſore abaſſhed and wyſte
nat what to ſayd or do. Than the dukes of Berrey
and of Burgoyne ſayde / it behoueth vs to
recourne to Mans / this voyage is doone for
this tyme. They ſayde nat as moche as they
thought / but they ſhewed it ryght well after
whan they came to Parys / to ſuche as they loued
nat / as ye ſhall here after.
            
               REaſonably to conſydre all thinges
acordynge to the trouthe / it
was great pytie that the french
kyng (who as at that tyme was
reputed for the moſte noble and
puyſſaunt kynge in all cryſtendome / 
fell ſo ſodaynly out of his mynde with
out remedy / but as god wolde. than the kynge
was layde in a horſe lyttoure / and ſo brought
backe agayne to the Cytie of Mans. Than
the marſhalles gaue knowledge to all the armye / 
that they ſhulde retourne / and howe that
the voyage was broken as at that tyme. ſome
had knowledge why / and ſome nat. The nyght
that the kynge came to Mans / the phyſicyons
had moche a do with hym / and the lordes
of the blode royall had great trouble. Euery
man ſpake than in dyuer
                  •
                maners. ſome ſayd
that ſuche as hadde the rule aboute the kynge
had poyſoned hym / to brynge the Realme of
Fraunce in to ſhame and trouble. Theſe wordes
multyplyed in ſuche wyſe that the duke of
Orlyance and his vncles and other lordes of
the blode royall noted them / and ſpake togyther
and ſayde. Howe ſaye you ſyrs / haue ye
nat herde theſe wordes / and howe menne do
murmure in dyuets places vpon theym that
hath had the gouernaunce of the kynge. ſome
ſaythe he ſhulde be poyſoned / lette vs ſertche
howe this maye be knowen. Than ſome of
them ſayde howe it ſhulde be beſt knowen by
the phyſycyons / they ought to knowe it / for
they are acquaynted with his complexcyon.
The phyſicyons were ſent for and examyned.
They anſwered howe the kyng of longe tyme
had engendred the ſame malady / for we knewe
well the wekenes of his brayne wold ſore trouble
hym / and at laſte ſhewe it ſelfe / we haue
ſayde as moche before this tyme. Than the
duke of Burgoyne ſayde. Syrs it is trewe / 
and therin ye dyd well acquyte your ſelfe / but
he wolde neyther beleue you nor vs his affeciyon
was ſo ſore ſette vpon this voyage / it
was deuyſed in an yuell tyme. This voyage
hathe dyſhonoured vs all. It had been better
that Clyſſon / and all thoſe of his affynyte had
ben deed many a daye agone / rather than the
kynge to haue taken this malady. Theſe tydynges
ſhall ſprede abrode in many places / 
and ſeyng yt he is but a yonge man / the blame
ſhall be layde in vs that be his vncles / and of
his blode / men wyll ſaye that we ſhulde otherwyſe
haue counſayled hym. Thus we ſhall be
laide in the faute without cauſe. but ſirs quod
the duke / yeſterday whan he wente to dyner / 
were ye with hym? The phyſicyons aunſwered
and ſayd yes. Dyd he eate his meate well
quod the duke? No certaynly quod they / he
dyd eate and drinke but lytle / but ſate and muſed.
And who gaue hym drinke laſt quod the
duke? Syr quod they we canne nat tell you
that / for as ſoone as the table was taken vp / 
we departed and made vs redy to ryde / but
his chamberlayns or butlers canne tell that
beſt. Than Robert de Tulles a ſquyer of Pycardy
was ſent for / and demaūded who gaue
the kynge drinke laſte. Syrs quod he / ſyr Robert
of Lygnac. Than he was ſent for. Than
he was enquyred where he had the wyne that
the kynge dranke laſt of in his chambre whan
he wente to his horſe. Syr quod he / here is
Roberte of Tulles and I / we toke the ſaye in
the preſence of the kinge. That is trewe quod
Roberte of Tulles / ye nede nat doute therin
nor haue no ſuſpeciouſneſſe / for as yet there is
of the ſame wyne in the flagons / wherof we
wyll drinke and aſſaye before you. Than the
duke of Berrey ſayd / this nede nat / for ſurely
the kynge is nat poyſoned / his malady procedeth
of yuell counſayle / it is no tyme
to ſpeke of this mater nowe / 
let all alone tyll another
ſeaſon.

THus after this maner theſe lordes departed
eche fro other that nyght / and
went to their lodgyage. Than the kynges vncles
had ordeyned four knyghtes of honour to
wayte aboute the kynge / as ſyr Raynolde du
Royꝭſyr Raynolde of Toye / the lorde Grauſeers / 
& ſir Gyllyam of Marte / and the kynges
vncles ſent cōmaundement to the lorde dela
Ryuer and to ſyr Iohn̄ Mercyer / to Montagu / 
to the Begu of Vyllayns / to ſyr Gullyam
of Bordes / and to ſyr Helyon of Lygnac / 
that they ſhulde in no wyſe come aboute the
kynge / tyll he were in better eſtate. The nexte
daye the kynges vncles came to ſe the kynge / 
and founde hym ryght feble. Than they demaunded
what reſt he had taken that nyght.
They were anſwered / but ſmall reſt. That is
poore newes quod the duke of Burgoyn. And
than to them came the duke of Orlyance / and
ſo went all togyder to the kynge / and demaunded
of hym howe he dyd. He gaue none aunſwere / 
and loked ſtraungely on them / and had
loſte clene the knowledge of them. Theſe lordes
were ſore abaſſhed / and comuned togyder
and ſayde. We haue no more here to do / the
kyng is in an herde caſe / we do him more trouble
than ayde or good. Lette vs recōmaunde
hym to his chaumberlayns and phyſicyons / 
they canne beſt take hede to hym / lette vs go
ſtudy howe the realme maye be gouerned / or
els thinges wyll go amyſſe. Than the duke of
Burgoyne ſayd to the duke of Berrey. Fayre
brother it is beſt we drawe to Parys / and ordayne
to haue the kynge eaſely brought thyder / 
for better we ſhall take hede on hym there
than here in theſe partyes / & whan we be there
let vs aſſēble all the counſayle of Fraunce / and
ordeyne who ſhall haue the gouernaūce of the
realme / the duke of Orlayunce or we. That is
well ſayde quod the duke of Berrey / it were
good we ſtudyed where were beſt to haue the
kynge to lye that he myght the ſoner recouer
his helth. Than it was deuyſed that he ſhulde
be brought to the caſtell of Crayell / where is
good ayre / and a fayre countrey on the ryuer
of Oyſe. whan this was ordeyned than all the
men of warre had leaue to departe / and were
cōmaunded by the marſhalles euery man to
retourne peaſably in to his owne countrey / 
without doynge of any vyolence or domage
to the countreys as they ſhulde paſſe through / 
and if any dyd / their lordes and capytayns to
make a mendes. And the kynges two vncles
and the chauncellour of Fraunce ſente anone
ſoundry meſſangers to the good Cyties and
townes of Fraunce / that they ſhuld take good
hede to kepe well their townes / conſyderynge
that the kynge was nat well dyſpoſed in his
helthe. Their cōmaundementes were fulfylled.
The people of the realme of Fraunce were
fore abaſſhed whan they knew howe the king
was fallen ſycke and in a franſey / and menne
ſpake largely agaynſte them that counſayled
the kynge to go in to Bretaygne. And ſome other
ſayde / howe the kynge was betrayed by
them that bare the duke of Bretaygne and ſyr
Peter Craon agaynſt the kyng. Men coulde
nat be lette / but that they wolde ſpeke / the mater
was ſo hygh that wordes ranne therof dyuerſely.
Thus fynally the kyng was brought
to Crayell / and there lefte in the kepynge of
his phyſicyons / and of the ſayde four knyghtes.
Than euery man departed. And it was
commaunded to hyde and to kepe ſecrete the
kynges malady fro the knowledge of the quene
for a ſeaſone / for as than ſhe was great with
chylde. and all of her courte were cōmaunded
to kepe it ſecrete on payne of great punyſſhement.
Thus the kynge was at Crayell / in the
marches of Seulis and of Compyen / on the
ryuer of Oyſe / and kept by the ſayd knyghtes
and phyſycions / who gaue hym medicyns / 
but for all that he recouered but lytell helth.

            ¶Howe the dukes of Burgoyn and
Berrey vncles to the kynge had the
gouernaunce of the realme / & howe
they chaſed and toke ſuche as gouerned
the kynge before.
Cap. C.lxxxix.
            
               IN this ſeaſone there
was in ye realme of Fraunce
a wyſe and a ſage phyſicyon / 
the brewte was that
there was none lyke hym / 
and he was well be loued
with the lorde Coucy / he
was natyue of his countrey. As at that tyme

his a bydyng was in the cyte of Laon / he was
called mayſter Guylliam of Harſley. Whan
he knewe fyrſte the kynges malady / and by
what accydent he fell ſycke / he ſayd as he that
thought hym ſelfe to knowe the kynges compleryon / 
howe this maladye is fallen to the
kynge through faute his complexyon holdeth
to moche of ye moyſter of the ſee. theſe wordes
were reported to the lord Coucy / who was as
than at Paris with the duke of Orlyance and
with ye kinges vncles / for as than the coūſayle
of Fraūce the noble men and prelates were at
Paris / to determyne who ſhulde haue the gouernaunce
of the realme / as longe as the kyng
ſhulde be in yt malady / outher his brother the
duke of Orlyance / or his two vncles / or one of
thē. vpon this cōmunycacion they were a .xv.
dayes or they agreed. Fynally it was concluded
bycauſe the duke of Orlyaunce was very
yonge to take on hym ſo great a charge / that
the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne ſhulde
haue the gouernaunce of the realme / and ſpecyally
the duke of Burgoyne / and that the duches
of Burgoyne ſhulde be aboute the quene
and to be as ſeconde perſon. Thus as I haue
ſayde before the lorde of Coucy ſhewed to the
kynges vncles / the great wyſdome and practyſe
of the ſayd phyſycion / mayſter Guyllyam
Harſeley. Whan the dukes herde that they
ſente for hym / and ſo he came to Parys. And
than the lorde of Couey preſented hym to the
kynges vncles / and ſayd. My lordes beholde
here is mayſter Guyllyam Harſeley / that I
ſhewed you of. He is ryght welcome quod the
dukes / they receyued him and made him good
chere / and ordeyned hym to go to Crayell to
vyſyte the kynge / and to abyde aboute hym
tyll he hadde recouered his helthe. Than the
ſayd mayſter at their cōmaundement went to
Crayell to the kynge / and had the chiefe ouer
ſyght of mynyſtryng any thynge to the kyng / 
and he ſawe well the kynges malady was curable / 
and ſawe howe he had taken it by reaſone
of febleneſſe of his herte and heed / and
through faute / therfore he dyd his dylygence
to recouer his helthe.
            THe tydynges of the kynges malady
ſpred farre abrode / but who ſo euer
was ſorye / ye maye well knowe the
duke of Bretaygne nor ſyr Peter of Craon
wepte neuer a deale / nor had no great ſorowe.
Alſo whan pope Boryface of Rome and his
cardynals knowe the trouthe / they were right
ioyfull / and drewe togyther in conſiſtory / and
ſayde howe their greateſt enemy the Frenche
kynge was beaten with a cruell rodde / ſeyng
god had taken fro hym his wytte / and ſayde
howe that influence was ſente to hym fro heuen
to chaſtyce hym withall / bycauſe he had ſo
moche ſuſteyned the pope at Auignon / therfore
this cruell plage was ſent to hym to cauſe
the hole realme to be better aduyſed / therfore
they ſayd their quarell was the ſtronger. And
truely to haue wyſely conſydred euery thynge
it was a great token to haue cauſed the cardynalles
at Auygnon to haue been aduyſed / but
they made but lytell force therof / nother to the
honour of god nor to the realme / for the pope
at Auignon and his cardynalles ſayde / howe
by reaſone that the kynge was yonge / and
wolde haue his owne wyll / therby he is fallen
in to this malady / through faute / for ſuche as
haue had the rule aboute hym / haue nat doone
their duetie / but haue ſuffred hym to rynne on
the bridell / and to ryde nyght and daye exceſſyuely
in traueylynge of his body out of meaſure.
therfore ſuche as hath had the rule ought
to be charged therwith / and none other / for it
is through their faulte / for if they had ordred
hym in his youthe / and ſo contynued by a reaſonable
regement / and haue folowed the counſayle
of his vncles / this ſyckneſſe had nat fallen
to hym nowe. Alſo he hath broken his promeſſe
againſt reaſon / for he promyſed the yere
paſſed and ſware by the wordes of a kynge / 
that he wolde ſo ordayne to dyſtroy the antepape
at Rome and his cardynals / and to ſubdue
the ſyſme of the churche / and to ſette the
maters that be in trouble in good eſtate / whiche
is nothynge doone / but hathe doone contrary
to his promeſſe / wherwith god is dyſpleaſed / 
and to cauſe hym better to aduyſe him
ſelfe / he hathe punyſſhed hym with this cruell
rodde. And if he retourne to helte / as he may
well do / than it ſhall behoue vs to ſende to
him ſufficyent legates / to ſhewe hym
wyſely the defaute and brekyng
of his promeſſe / that he forgette
it nat by reaſon
of our neclygēce.
            
               
               THus the pope and his cardynalles
at Auignon ſpake and comuned
toguyder / and layde the defaute
of the kynges malady / on
the counſayle of Fraūce / and on
ſuche as were about the kynge in his chambre.
Of the ſame oppinyon were many other
folkes in the realme of Fraunce. They
that were about the kynge ſence the kynges
offrynge to a towne called Areſnecke / in the
countie of Heynaulte / bytwene Cambrey &
Valencennes. In the whiche towne there
was a Churche / parteyninge to an abbey of
ſaynt Waſte in Arraſce / wherin there lyeth
a ſaynt called ſaint Acquayre / of whom there
is a ſhrme of ſyluer / whiche pylgrimage is
ſought farre and nere / for the malady or fraſey.
Thyder was ſente a man of waxe / repreſentynge
the Frenche kynge / and was humbly
offred to the ſaynt / that he myght be meane
to God / to aſſwage the kynges malady / 
and to ſende him helthe. In lykewiſe the kynges
offrynge was ſente to ſaynt Hermyer in
Romayes / whiche ſaynt had meryce to heale
the Franſey. And in lykewiſe o
                  •
               ryngꝭ were
ſent ī to other places for ye ſame entent. Whā
the tidynges were come in to Englande / the
kynge and his counſayle were ſore troubled
therwith / and ſpecially the duke of Lancaſtre / 
and he ſayd to ſuche knyghtes and ſquyers
as were aboute hym. Sirs / ſurely it is
great pytic of the Frenche kynge / for he ſemed
to be a man of great enterprice / and of
great deſyre to do well. He ſayde to me at Amyence
whan I departed fro hym. Fayre coſyn
or Lancaſtre / I deſyre you hertely to do
your dylygence / that a ferme peace maye be
made bytwene our nephue the kynge of Englande
and vs / and oure realmes / to the entent
that we myght go togyder agaynſt Lamorabaquyn / 
who hath conquered the Realme
of Armony / and dothe that he can to diſtroye
Chriſtendome. By our goyne thider
our faithe ſhulde be exalted / & we are all boū
               de
therto. And nowe by the Frenche kynges
malady the mater is ſore letted and hyndred
for he ſhall neuer be of the credence he was
of before. All that herde the duke ſayde. It
was trewe / and that it was lyke to be great
trouble in Fraunce.
            Thus all maner of people bothe tarre and
nere ſpake and deuyſed of the kynges maladye / 
and the kyng laye ſtyll at Crayle / in the
kepynge of the foreſaid knyghtes / & of maiſter
Guyllyam of Harſely: And no man ſpake
with the kynge / nor entred in to the caſtell
but ſuche as were ordayned therto. Somtyme
the duke of Orlyaunce and the duke of
Burbone / came thyder to viſyte the kynge / 
and the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne
laye ſtyll at Parys / and had done nothynge
of newe / but they were in purpoſe ſhortely
to do ſomwhat / agaynſt ſuche as they loued
nat / bycauſe they hadde been alwayes harde
to them before. and the duke of Berrey ſaid
to the duke of Burgoyne. Brother / le Ryuer / 
Clyſſon / le Mercyer / and the Begue of
Vallayns / whan they were with the kynge
in Languedocke / ccuelly they punyſſhed to
dethe / my treaſourer and good ſeruaunt Betyſache
by euuy. And for all that I coude do
or ſaye / I coulde nat gette hym out of their
handes / nor ſaue his lyre. Therfore nowe let
them beware or me / for I ſhall paye them agayn
with the ſame money / forged in ye ſame
forge. In lykewiſe the duke of Burgoyne
coude nat ioue them that gouerned the kyng
for euer whane he had any buſyneſſe to do in
the courte / they were euer agaynſt hym. Alſo
the ſame tyme the ducheſſe of Burgoyne / 
who was a cruell lady / was about the quene
as chefe ruler / and non ſpake with the quene
but by her meanes.
            THis lady hated mortally ſir Olyuer
of Clyiſone for loue of the duke of
Bretayne / for he was nere of blode
to her / and often tymes ſhe ſpake to the duke
her huſbande / ſayeng howe he was greatlye
to blame to beare ſo moche ſir Olyuer of Cliſſon
agaynſt ſo myghtie a prince / as the duke
of Brecaygne. And the duke of Burgoyne / 
who was a colde / a ſage / and an ymaginatyue
prince / and dyde his buſyneſſe alwayes
at length / and wolde nat wyllyng bringe the
realme of Fraūce in to trouble / but alwayes
wyllyng to kepe all ꝑties in loue and peace / 
as nere as he myght. And alſo as he yt was neuer
wyllyng to diſpleaſe any of ye great lordꝭ
anſwered right ſagely & wyſely to his wyfe.
Dame ꝙ he / it is good in all tymes ſōwhat
to diſſymnle a mannes diſpleaſure. True it
is our coſyn of Bretayne is a great lorde / &
hath ſeignorie & puiſſaunce ynough agaynſt

ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / if I hadde taken his
parte agaynſt Clyſſon / it ſhulde greatly haue
weaked the Realme of Fraunce. For ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſone ſaythe and ſuſtayneth / 
that all the hate that he hath to the Duke of
Bretaygne / is to ſuſtayne vp the realme of
Fraunce wherin we haue great parte. And
alſo this is the cōmon renome in Fraūce. Alſo
(as yet) I haue ſene no artycle / wherin I
ſhulde take parte with my coſyn of Bretaygne
agaynſt ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon. therfore
it hath behoued me to diſſymule / or elles I
coude nat haue had the good wyll of ye kyng
nor of the realme / wherto I am more boūde
by faithe and ſeruyce / than to ye duke of Bretaygne.
Nowe it is ſo that the kyng is nat
in good caſe (as ye knowe well) and all this
is agaynſt the lorde Cliſſon / and ſhalbe. and
to ſuche as haue gyuen coūſayle agaynſt vs / 
my brother of Berrey and me / that the kyng
ſhulde procede in his iourney to Bretaygne
The rodde is gadered wherwith they ſhall
be ſhortely beaten and corrected: as ye ſhall
breuely here / if yet wyll take a lytell paciēce.
            Dame dame / there is no ſeaſon / but at laſt
is payde: Nor no fortune / but that ſomtyme
tourneth: Nor herte troubled / but ſomtyme
agayne reioyceth: Nor none that is ioyfull / 
but ſomtyme is ſorie and troubled. Clyſſon / 
le Ryuer / Montague / le Mercyer / & le Vyllayns:
they haue done yuell / and that ſhalbe
ſhewed them breuely. With ſuche lyke wordes
the duke of Burgoyne and the ducheſſe
his wyfe ſported thē toguyder.
            
               ON a daye it happed that ye duke
of Burgoyne and the duke of
Berrey cōmuned ſecretely togyder / 
& ſayde. It were tyme that
we began to diſtroye them that
haue diſhonored our nephue the kynge / and
haue ledde hym at their wylles. And firſt let
vs begyn at the cōſtable / he is ye gretteſt and
hath moſt to leſe / for this other daye he made
his teſtament of ſeuyntene hūdred thouſāde
frankes. Where the deuyll hath he gadered
toguyder all that richeſſe? And yet the mary
age of his doughter to Iohan of Bretayne / 
whom he delyuered out of priſon in Englād
and payde for his raūſome two hūdred thouſande
frankes of Englande. Let vs ſe what
poyntes we can lay to him by reaſon / for our
nephue the duke of Orleaunce beareth hym
greatlye / and ſo do dyuers other barones of
Fraunce. Howe be it and we ſtycke therto / 
we ſhall finde mater ynough to him by lawe
and parlyament. That is trewe quod the duke
of Burgoyne. And the firſt tyme that he
cometh to ſpeke with me (and that I thynke
wyll be or to morowe at night) I ſhall ſo receyue
hym / that he ſhall well knowe that I
loue hym nat / and if he come to you good brother
of Berrey do lykewiſe. That ſhall be
done quod he / and ſo departed at that tyme.
            SO it fortuned that the lorde of Clyſſon / 
who knewe nothynge but that
he had been in good grace with the
ſayde dukes. And certayne knightes & ſquiers
(ſuche as hadde been in the ſayd voyage
with the kyng) came to the conſtable / & were
ſente by the chaunceller and treaſourers to
hym / to purſue for money for their wages.
Whervpon in a mornyng he came to ye houſe
of Arthois in Parys / to ſhewe the ſtate of ye
buſyneſſe to the duke of Burgoyne / and to
none other / bycauſe he hadde the hole gouernaunce
of the realme of Fraunce. Whan̄e he
came thyder he entred in to the court / for the
porter had lette hym in. Than he a lyghted
and mounted the ſteares in to the hall / alone
lye acompanyed with one ſquyer / and in the
hall he foūde .ii. ſquyers of the dukes. than
he demaunded if he might ſpeke wt the duke
or nat. Sir ꝙ they we can nat tell you / tary
here and we ſhall go & knowe his pleaſure.
The ſquiers entred in to the dukes chambre
and foūde hym at good leyſar / talkyng with
an heraude / who was come fro a great feeſt
that had ben holden in Almaigne. Than the
ſquiers ſayd. Sir / the Conſtable is in your
hall / and ſaythe he is come to ſpeke with you
if it be your pleaſure. A goddeſname quod
the duke lette hym come in / we be at good leyſar
to here what he wyll ſay. One of the ſquiers
went in to the hall and ſaid to the conſtable.
ſir cōe on / my lorde wyll haue you to cōe
in. The cōſtable entred / and whan the duke
ſawe hym he chaunged colour / and repented
in that he had cauſed hym to come in to his
chambre / and yet he had gret deſyre to ſpeke
with hym. The Conſtable dyde of his hatte
and made his reuerence to the duke & ſayde.

Sir I am come to you / to knowe of the ſtate
and gouernaunce of the realme / and howe
euery thynge ſhalbe ordred / for by reaſon of
myne offyce I am dayly called vpon / and as
nowe / you and my lorde of Berrey haue the
rule / therfore it may pleaſe you to ſhewe me
what I ſhall do. The duke lightly aunſwered
and ſayde. Clyſſon Clyſſon / ye haue nothyng
to do to buſye you with the gouernynge
of the realme / ye haue medled therwith to
long / and in an yuell tyme. Howe the deuyll
haue ye gadered ſuche rycheſſe / as ye made
your teſtament of but late? The kynge nor
my brother of Berrey nor I / haue nat ſo moche.
Go youre waye departe out of my preſence / 
and lette me no more ſe you / for and it
were nat for my ſhame / I ſhulde putte out
your better eye. And therwith the duke deꝑted
and lefte the lorde Clyſſon alone / who iſſued
out of the chambre and hanged downe
his heed / and ſo paſſed through the hall / and
in the courte toke his horſe with his company / 
and retourned priuely in to his lodgyng
without ſpekyng of any worde.

            ¶Howe ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon Conſtable
of Fraūce departed out of Parys / 
after the anſwere that the duke
of Burgoyne had made hym / and
wente to Mount le Heury / and fro
thens in to Bretayne.
Cap. C.xc.
            
               WHan the lorde of Clyſſon
was retourned to his
lodgynge / he was in many
ymaginacyons / to remembre
what was beſt for hym
to do. for he parceyued wel
the maters went but yuell
for hym / nor he wyſte nat to whome to make
his complaynt / nor to declare his buſyneſſe / 
for the duke of Orlyaunce was at Crayell.
and thoughe he hadde been at Parys / yet it
laye nat in his power to defende hym / and he
feared leſt the duke of Burgoyne wolde haue
cauſed hym to be areſted / and to ſpoyle
his houſe. Wherfore he durſt nat abyde that
aduenture / but ſhortely made hym redy / and
ſhewed to certayne of his ſeruauntes what
he wolde do. And agaynſt nyght he wente
out of his lodgyng priuely on the backeſyde
and but thre perſones with hym / and iſſued
out of Parys at the gate of ſaynt Anchony / 
and paſſed the ryuer of Seyne at the bridge
of Charenton. And roode ſo longe that he
came to a Caſtell of his owne / a ſeuyn leages
fro Parys / called Mount le Heury / and
there taryed tyll he heroe other tidynges.
The ſame daye that the duke of Burgoyne
had ſpoken with the Conſtable. The duke
of Berrey and he mette toguyder / for they
aſſembled at the palays to commune toguyder
of certayne matters / touchynge the Realme.
Than the duke of Burgoyne ſhewed
his brother what he had ſayde to ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon. The duke of Berrey anſwered
and ſayd. ye haue done well / for we muſt haue
a begynnynge to entre vpon theym. For
ſurely Clyſſon / le Ryuer / Mercier and Mō
               tague / 
haue robbed the realme of Fraunce / 
but the tyme is come that they ſhall leaue all
yea / and leſe their lyues / and I maye be beleued.
            THe ſame proper daye that the Conſtable
departed / Montague in likewiſe
departed ſecretely / by the gate
ſaynt Anthony / and toke the waye to Trois
in Champayne and in to Burgoyne / & ſayd
he wolde nat reſt tyll he came to Auygnon / 
for thyder he had ſent before the chiefe of his
rycheſſe / and lefte a certayne with his wyfe
to kepe her eſtate curteſly. For he ſawe well
ſithe the kyng had loſt his wytte / that all maters
ſhulde go but yuell for hym. for he ſawe
howe the dukes of Burgoyne and Berrey
wolde nat ſpeke to hym. Sir Iohan Mercier
in lykewiſe wolde fayne haue ben gone
and he myght / But there was ſuche watche
layde on hym / that he coude nat go out of his
lodgynge / without knowledge. And ſuche
of his goodes as he hadde ſaued before / ſtode
hym in right good ſtede afterwarde. For
as moche as coude be founde of his / was departed
bytwene the dukes of Burgoyn and
Berrey / and he was cōmytted by them to priſone / 
in to the caſtell of Loure. And in lykewyſe

ſo was cōmaunded the Begue of Vyllayns
erle of Rebydewe in Spayne. There
were men ſente to the houſe of Montague / 
but he was nat founde / nor no man knewe
where yt he was become. In lykecase to the
Conſtables houſe to haue had hym to priſon
but he coude nat be founde / for there was no
man there but the kepar / who knewe nothynge
where he was become. And within two
dayes after / it was knowen that he was at
his caſtell of Mount le Heury. Whan the dukes
that loued hym nat knewe that / they ordayned
the Barroys of Barres / ſir Iohn̄ of
Caſtell Morant / the lorde of Coucy / and ſir
Wyllyam of Tremoyle / with thre hundred
ſpeares to go thyder / and cōmaunded them
to beſiege the Towne and caſtell / and nat to
departe thens / tyll they had brought ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon to thē / outher quicke or deed.
Theſe knyghtes dyde as they were cōmaunded / 
they durſte do none otherwyſe / for the
two dukes had the admyniſtracion of the realme.
So they departed fro Parys with a
thre hundred ſpeares / but nat all at one tyme
but in fyue partes / to the entent to be the leſſe
knowen. But god ayded ſo well the Conſtable / 
and had ſo good frendes of ſome in that
company / that he had ſuche warnynge / that
he toke no dōmage / for he and his company
departed and rode by couert wayes through
woodes / and lefte cloſed townes / ſo that at
laſte he came ſurely in to Bretaygne / and entred
in to a caſtell of his owne called the caſtell
Ioſelyn / and there taryed to here other
newes. For all that the Barrois or Barres
and the other knightes in his company / lette
nat to do their enterprice as they were charged / 
but came to Mount le Heury / and entred
in to the towne / and beſieged the caſtell
and taryed there all a nyght / wenynge that
the Conſtable hadde ben within / but he was
gone / as ye haue herde: and the nexte mornynge
they thought to aſſaute the Caſtell.
The ſeruaūtes within the caſtell ſente out to
knowe what they wolde haue / or what they
demaunded. They ſayde they wolde haue
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / & therfore they were
come. They anſwered and ſaid / that he was
departed thens foure dayes paſſed / and offred
to open the gates to ſertche for hym. the
knightes went in to the caſtell with all their
company armed / for ſcare of enbuſſhement
within the caſtell. They ſertched highe and
lowe and founde for trouthe that he was nat
there. Than̄e they departed and retourned
to Parys / and ſhewed howe they had ſped.
            
               WHan the dukes of Burgoyne &
Berrey knewe that ſir Olyuer
Clyſſon was ſcaped / they were
ſore diſpleaſed / and the dukes
of Orlyaunce and of Burbone
ryght ioyfull. Than the duke of Burgoyne
ſayde. It ſemeth well that he douteth hym
ſelfe / ſeynge he is fledde awaye. yet for all yt
he is ſo quytte / we ſhall cauſe hym to come agayne
ſhortely / or les he ſhall leſe all that he
hath / that we can ſette our handes on. for we
haue to laye to his charge / dyuers artycles
vnreſonable / whiche requyre iudgement of
puniſyon. and if ſuche as be great be nat corrected / 
the maters ſhall nat be equally proporcioned / 
for ſuche as be but ſmall perſonages
ſhall grudge / and ſaye they haue wrong
to be punyſſhed / and the great to ſcape. therfore
iuſtyce ought to be equall / and to ſpare
nother gret nor ſmall / wherby any enſample
ſhulde growe. Thus the duke of Burgoyn
deuyſed of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / who was
in Bretaygne / in his caſtell called Ioſelyn / 
whiche fortereſſe was well prouyded for of
all thynges neceſſary. Whan the Barrois of
Barres was retourned to Parys / and had
ſhewed that ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon was departed
fro Mount le Heury / and gone to the
caſtell of Ioſelyn in Bretayne. Thā he was
cōmaunded to go to Amyence & there to take
the lorde de la Ryuer. The next day he rode
with his companye to Amyence / a fayre fortereſſe
beſyde Charters / whiche the lorde de
la Ryuer helde by right of his wyfe / the lady
of Mans. He had greatly amended that caſtell / 
and was welbeloued of the men of his
countrey / for he loued alwayes nothyng but
trouth. Than the dukes cōmiſſyoners came
thyder and dyde as they had in charge / and
founde the lorde de la Ryuer there / and his
wyfe & his chyldren. the knight loked for nothyng
els / for he might haue ben gone before
if he had lyſte / for he had knowledge that ſir
Iohan Mercyer and the erle of Ribydewe
were in priſone / and that the Conſtable was
fledde in to Bretaygne. And he was counſayled

before by one of his frendes / who ſaid
to hym. Sir / ſaue your ſelfe / for the enuyous
do nowe reygne / and fortune as nowe is on
their ſydes. He aunſwered and ſayde. Here
and els where / I am at the pleaſure of god.
If I ſhulde flye or hyde my ſelfe / I ſhulde
yelde my ſelfe gyltie / where I knowe my ſelfe
clere. God hath gyuen me that I haue / and
he maye take it fro me whan it is his pleaſure.
The wyll of god be fulfylled. I haue
ſerued kynge Charles / and nowe his ſonne
well and trewly. My ſeruyce hath ben well
knowen with them / and they haue greatlye
rewarded me. And ſeyng that I haue ſo truely
ſerued at their cōmaundementes / and traueyled
for the buſyneſſe of the realme of Frā
               ce / 
I dare well abyde the iudgement of the
parlyament chambre in Parys. and if they
can fynde any faute in my dedes or wordes / 
lette me be punyſſhed. Thus the lorde de la
Ryuer ſayd to his wyfe and to his coūſayle.
This he ſayd or the dukes cōmyſſioners cāe
to his caſtell. At laſte one ſhewed hym and
ſayd. Sir / here cometh ſuche men and ſuche
with a great armye. Nowe ſaye you / ſhall
we opyn the gates or nat? yea quod he what
elles / they are welcome. Therwith he went
and mette them / and receyued them one after
another right honorably. Thus they all entred
in to the caſtell of Mans. Than the barroies
of Barres whan they were within the
hall executed his commaundement / and areſted
the lorde de la Ryuer / who obeyed meke
lye. Thus he was priſoner in his owne caſtell
of Mans. It may well be thought that
the good lady his wyfe was ſore diſcōfyted / 
whan ſhe ſawe fortune courne her whele / agaynſt
her lorde and huſbande / and alſo ſhe
douted the concluſyon.
            
               THus the lorde de la Ryuer was
priſoner in his owne Caſtell of
Mains. And anone after he was
ſente for by them that had the gouernaunce / 
bothe of the temporaltie
and of the ſpirytualtie. For pope Clement
of Auignon had nothyng in the realme
of Fraunce / but by their meanes. The lorde
de la Ryuer was brought to Parys / and ſet
in priſon in the caſtell of Loure. Many men
in the realme of Fraunce had great pytie on
hym / howe be it they durſt nat ſpeke but priuely.
The people cared nat ſo moche for the
trouble of ſir Iohan Mercyer / as they dyde
for the lorde de la Ryuer. For he was alway
ſwete / curteſſe / meke / pacyent / and gencyll
to poore men: and a good meane always for
them that myght nat be herde. It was ſayde
daylye in Paris / that theſe priſoners ſhulde
leſe their heedes. And a ſclaundre ran vpon
them / howe they were traytours againſt the
crowne of Fraunce / and pylled the realme / 
and therby kepte their great portes and eſtates:
and made fayre houſes / caſtelles / & buyldynges.
And other poore knightes and ſquiers / 
ſuche as had aduentured their bodyes &
membres in dedes of armes / and ſerued truelye
the realme of Fraunce / and had ſolde and
layde to pledge their herytages / & yet coude
nat be payde / for that they had ſerued / Nother
by the cōſtable nor by none of them that
were in priſone: nor hy Mōtague that was
fledde. The enuyous condempned and iudged
them to dye. So by reaſon of this they
were in great daunger / and alſo it was ſayd
that by their counſaile the kyng toke on hym
the iourney in to Bretaygne / wherby he fell
in to that maladye of Franſey / and had gyuen
hym drinkes of poyſon at their pleaſure
and howe that the kynges phiſycions coude
nat be herde nor beleued / by reaſon of them.
Suche maters were layde to the lorde de la
Ryuers charge and to ſir Iohan Mercyer / 
that they were delyuered out of the Caſtell
of Loure / in to the handes of the prouoſt of
Paris / and putte in to the caſtell of ſaynt Anthony / 
in the kepyng of the Vicount of Achy
who as than was Chateleyne there. Whan
it was knowen that they were there / thā the
cōmon brute ran / that they ſhulde be executed
to dethe. But to ſaye trouthe / there was
no cauſe why to trouble them. For ſuche as
hated them / coude fynde in their conſcyence / 
no cauſe why they ought to dye. But euery
daye they were borne in hande / and it was
ſayd to theym. Sirs / thynke on youre ſoules / 
for as for your bodyes are but loſte / for
ye are iudged to dye / and for to be beheeded.
In this caſe they were in Priſone a greate
ſpace. The Begue of Vyllayns a ryght valyaunt
knyght in armes / of the countrey of
Beance / who was in priſone alſo for ye ſame
cauſe. He had ſuche frendes and was ſo ayded

that he was delyuered out of priſon / and
was clene pardoned of all thynges. And ſuche
as were of his lynage / as ſir Barroys &
other / counſayled hym to go in to Caſtyle / 
where as he had fayre herytages / by reaſon
of his wyfe / counteſſe of Ribydewe / and as
he was counſayled ſo he dyede. And as ſoone
as he might departed out of Fraunce & went
in to Caſtyle / and the other two knightes remayned
ſtyll in priſon / in daunger of loſyng
of their lyues.
            ALl the mouable and vnmouable godes
and poſſeſſions parteyninge to
ſir Iohan Mercyer within Parys
and without / in the realme of Fraunce / that
myght be layde hande on / was taken as goodes
forfaite / and gyuen to other perſons. his
fayre houſe of the bridge of Aubumen in the
dioces of Laon / whiche had coſt hym a great
good / was gyuen to the lorde Coucy / with
all the appurtenaūce. I knowe nat wheder
the lorde of Coucy deſyred it or nat / but ſir
Iohan Mercier was diſheryted / he and his
heyres for euer. Alſo the lorde de la Ryuer
was ſore handled. Trewe it was / all his mouables
was taken awaye / and ſuche landes
as he had bought / reſeruynge to the lady of
Mans his wyfe all her herytages / whiche
came by her by father & mother. Alſo he had
a yonge damoſell to his doughter of .x. yere
or age / who was maryed to a yonge gentylman
called Iaques of Chaſtellon / ſonne to
ſir Hugh of Chaſtellon / who had ben before
maiſter of the croſbowes of Fraunce. and he
was heyre to his father / and had fayre herytages / 
and was lykely to enioye more / howe
be it agaynſt the yonge mannes mynde / he
was diſmaryed. And maryed agayne to another
gentylwoman / at the pleaſure of the duke
of Burgoyne and of the lorde de la Tremoyle / 
who toke on them that quarell. more
ouer / the lorde de la Riuer had a ſonne to his
heyre / whiche ſonne was maryed to ye doughter
of the erle Dampmartyne. And the erle
had no mo children nor was nat lyke to haue
whiche doughter was his heyre. And the duke
wolde haue broken that maryage / & haue
maryed her vnto an heyre of blode / But the
erle Dampmartyne lyke a valyaunt knight
wolde nat / but ſayd. As long as the lorde de
la Ryuers ſonne hadde lyfe in his body / his
doughter ſhulde haue none other huſbande
and ſayde / he wolde putte her herytage in to
ſuche mēnes handes / that he truſted ſuche as
wolde wrōgfully haue it / ſhulde nat attayne
therto. Whan the erles mynde was knowen
they let hym alone. So that maryage ſtode
ſtyll / but the fyrſt maryage was broken / and
pope Clement made a diſpenſacyon wheder
he wolde or nat / for as at that tyme the pope
had no more puiſſaunce in Fraunce / Than
ſuche as the gouernours wolde conſente to.
The churche was ſo ſubiecte / what by reaſon
of the Sciſme / and by them that gouerned
Fraunce. Many men ſpecially in the realme
of Fraūce / excuſed greatly the lorde de
la Ryuer / but all that wolde nat ſerue / For
none durſt ſpeke thoughe they ſawe the mater
neuer ſo clere. Except all onely the valyāt
lady Iane of Boloyne / ducheſſe of Berrey.
Oftentymes the good lady wolde fall on her
knees before her huſbande / holdynge vp her
handes and ſayeng. Ah ſir / ye ſuffre to moche
the enuyous to enforme you ſo wrongfullye / 
agaynſt the valyaunt knight. The lorde
de la Ryuer he hath clerely wronge / there is
none that dare ſpeke for hym but I. And ſir / 
I wyll ye knowe that if he dye thus / I ſhall
neuer haue ioye in this worlde / but I ſhall
alwayes contynue ſtyll in ſorowe and heuyneſſe / 
for he is a trewe and a valyant knight.
Ah ſir / ye cōſyder but lytell the fayre ſeruyce
that he hath done to you or this tyme: ye paynes
and traueyle that he hath hadde for you
and for me / to bring vs togyder in maryage.
I ſaye it nat for any thyng of boſtyng of my
ſelfe / for I am but lytell worthe in comparyſon
to you. But whan ye wolde nedes haue
me / ye remembre howe harde the erle of Foiz
was to you / with whom I was brought vp / 
And if the ſwete wordes / and wyſe demeanour
of the lorde de la Ryuer had nat been / 
I had neuer come in to your company / but I
had ben rather as nowe in Englāde. For the
duke of Lācaſtre wolde haue had me for his
ſonne the erle of Derby / and the erle of Foiz
enclyned rather that waye thā to you. Right
dere ſir / ye ought to remēbre this / for all that
I ſay is true. Wherfore I requyre you right
hūbly / that this gentyll knight who brought
me to you / haue no dōmage of his body nor
of his membres. The duke of Berrey who
ſawe his wyfe fayre and gentyll / and loued

her with all his hert / and alſo knewe well that
all ſhe had ſayd was true / it molifyed greatly
his herte towardes the lorde de la Ryuer / and
to apeaſe his wyfe / becauſe he ſawe ſhe ſpake
with good herte / ſayd vnto her. Dame as god
helpe me I wolde it had coſt me .xx. thouſāde
frankes / on the condycion the lorde de la Ryuer
had neuer made forfette to the crowne of
Fraunce / for before this malady came to the
kynge / I loued hym entierly / and tooke hym
for a wyſe and a ſage knyght. but ſythe ye deſyre
ſo effectuouſly for hym I wyll do no dyſpleaſure
to hym / he ſhall fare moche the better
at your inſtaunce / and for your ſake I ſhall do
as moche for hym as my power may extende / 
and rather at your deſyre than and all the realme
had ſpoken for hym / for ſurely I ſe well
it is almes to helpe hym / and I beleue he hath
no aduocate but you. Thus the lady was well
pleaſed with her lordes wordes / for ſurely and
ſhe had nat ben he had been deed / but for her
ſake the duke of Berrey dyſſymuled the mater / 
and that was happy for ſyr Iohan Mercyer / 
for he and the lorde de la Ryuer were accuſed
for one cauſe / wherfore the dukes had
conſcyence to cauſe one to dye and nat the other / 
howe be it for all the promeſſe that was
made to them / yet they thought them ſelfe nat
well aſſured of their lyues / as longe as they
were in priſon / for they ſawe well they had as
than many enemyes / who as thā reygned and
were in their proſperyte / and ſome were right
angry that they were ſaued ſo longe / and they
coulde amended it. Syr Iohan Mercyer beynge
in priſone wepte ſo contynually / that he
had almoſt loſt his ſight / it was pytie to ſe his
lamentacyon.
            WHyle theſe two knyghtes were thus
in priſone more than a yere / and no
man knewe what ende ſhulde come
of them. Than the dukes and their counſayle
dyd all that they coulde to haue taken ſir Olyuer
Clyſſon / and to haue put hym fro his honoure
and offyce. They had rather haue had
hym than all the reſydewe / but he kepte hym
ſelfe out of their handes / wherin he dyd wyſely / 
for if he had ben taken they had ſo ordeyned
for him / that he ſhulde haue had iudgement of
deth without remedy / and all for enuy to haue
pleaſed therby his aduerſary the duke of Bretaygne / 
who neuer dyd good in the realme of
Fraūce. whan the lordes ſawe yt he was ſcaped
their handes / they toke other aduyſe / & dyd as
ye ſhall here. They ſōmoned hym to apere in
the parlyamēt chamber at Parys / to anſwere
to ſuch articles as he was accuſed of / on payne
to leſe his honour and to be banyſſhed the realme
of Fraunce / certayne cōmyſſioners were
ſent in to Bretaygne to ſōmon hym to apere.
They that were ſente rode in to Bretaygne / 
and demaūded where as they came where ſyr
Olyuer of Clyſſon was / and ſayd howe they
were ſente by the kynge to ſpeke with the conſtable / 
wherfore they deſyred to knowe where
he was. The men of ſuche townes and garyſons
as helde of the conſtable were determyned
before what aunſwere to make / and ſayd / 
ſyrs ye be welcome / and if ye wyll ſpeke with
the coūſtable ye muſte go in to ſuche a place / 
there we thynke ye ſhall fynde hym without
faute. So the cōmyſſyoners were ſente fro
towne to towne / but they coude nat fynde him.
And ſo longe they ſought that they were wery / 
and ſo retourned to Parys / and declared
what they had ſene and founde. ſuche as had
accuſed hym were gladde that he dalte ſo / for
than they ſayd his falſneſſe was playnely ſhewed / 
and therby acordyng to reaſon they ſaid
he ſhulde haue as he had deſerued. Than by
the courſe of the parlyament they proceded to
all his ſōmonynges / to thentent that ſuche as
loued hym ſhulde nat ſay he had any wronge / 
by Enuy or hatred. And whan all his .xv. ſō
               monynges
were accompilſſhed / and that they
coulde here no tydynges of hym / nor of his aparaunce / 
and that he had been openly called
at the parlyament chambre dore / and on the
ſteyres / and in the courte / with all other ſeremonyes
therto belongynge / and no anſwere
made for hym / he had proceſſe made agaynſt
hym cruelly in the parlyament. There he was
openly banyſſhed the realme of Fraunce as a
falſe traytour againſt the crowne of Fraunce / 
and iudged to pay a hūdred thouſande marke
of ſyluer for the extorcyons he had doone / and
for that he had ſo traftely in tyme paſte occupyed
the offyce of the conſtablery of Fraunce / 
and therfore to leſe for euer without recouery
the ſayd offyce. At the gyueng of this ſentence
the duke of Orleaunet was deſyred to be preſent / 
but he wolde nat / & excuſed hymſelfe / but
the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyn were there
with many other great lordes of the Realme

of Fraunce. Thus a man may ſe the wa
                  •
               kes
of fortune / howe ferme and ſtable they be / ſeynge
howe this good and valyaunt knyght / 
who in his dayes had ſo moche traueyled for
the realme of Fraunce / and as than was put
to ſo moche ſhame / as to be dyſgrated fro honoure
and goodes. Howe be it he was happy
he appered nat at their ſōmonynge / for if he
had / ſurrly he had ſhamfully loſte his lyfe. As
than the duke of Orlyance durſt nat ſpeke for
hym / if he had / it ſhulde haue doone hym no
good. It is nat to be douted but that the duke
of Bretaygne and ſyr Peter of Craon were
right ioyfull of thoſe tydinges howe be it they
were ſory that he was nat priſoner in Parys
as well as ſir Iohan Mercier and the lord de
la Ryuer. Of this ſhamfull banyſſhing great
brute ranne therof in the realme of Fraunce
and elſ where. ſome compleyned ſecretly and
ſayd that he had wronge. And ſome other ſaid
he was worthy to be hanged / and that he had
well deſerued it. and moreouer ſayd / howe the
dyuell coulde he aſſemble togyder ſo moche rycheſſ
as a myllyon and an halfe of florayns?
he coulde neuer gette that by ryghtwyſe meanes / 
but rather by pollynge and robbyng / and
retaynyng to hymſelfe the wages of the poore
knyghtes & ſquyers of the realme of Fraunce
that had deſerued it. as it may well appere in
the chaunceryor treaſory / where euery thyng
is written and regeſtred / in the voyage that
the Kynge made in to Flaunders. there and
than he reyſed great profyte to his owne vſe / 
and alſo in the voyage to Almayne / for all maner
of tayles and ſubſydyes that were reyſed
in the Realme to paye men of warre / paſſed
through his handes he payed where as it pleaſed
hym / and the reſt he kept to hymſelfe and
none durſte ſpeke agaynſt it. In this maner
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon was accuſed in many
mennes mouthes. It is ſayde in an olde prourebe / 
he that hath myſfortune / euery man offereth
hym wronge. If the frenche kynge / the
duke of Berrey / and the duke of Burgoyne
had nat ben / the duke of Bretaygne had ben
able to haue ſubdued ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
ſeynge he was in the dukes countrey / but he
ſuffred hym for a ſeaſon to ſe howe the maters
ſhulde procede. Alſo he ſawe well that ſyr Olyuer
of Clyſſon was ſet on the heyght of fortunes
whele / and as than agayne he ſawe howe
he was caſt downe / and lyke to leſe his offyce.
Thus the duke of Bretayne and ſyr Peter of
Craon were ſet vpon their fete / and all by the
workes of fortune / whiche is neuer parmanent / 
but nowe vp / nowe downe. The conſtable
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / the lorde de la Ryuer / 
& ſyr Iohan Mercyer / were principally
acuſed for the chefe couſers of the kinges malady.
And ſuche as loued them nat / ſayd howe
they had poyſoned the kynge. howe be it euery
man maye conſydre by reaſon that it was
nat ſo / for they were the perſones that ſhulde
leſe moſte by the kynges malady / wherfore
it is to be thought they ſought moſte for his
helthe / but they coulde nat be beleued. So the
two knyghtes remayned ſtyll in priſon in daū
               ger
openly to haue loſte their heedes / and by
all lykelyhode ſo they had doone / if the kynge
had nat recouered his helth / and by the meane
of the ducheſſe of Berrey / who made inſtante
labour for the lorde de la Ryuer. And the lorde
Clyſſon was ſtyll in Bretayne / and made ſore
warre agaynſt the duke there / and the duke agaynſt
hym / whiche warre coſt many a mannes
lyfe / as ye ſhall here / here after in this hyſtory.
            TRewe it is this ſyckneſſe that the kyng
tooke in the voyage towardes Bretayne / 
greatly abated the ioye of the realme of
Fraunce / and good cauſe why / for whan the
heed is ſicke the body canne haue no ioye. No
man durſte openly ſpeke therof / but kepte it
priuy as moche as myght be / and it was couertly
kept fro the quene / for tyll ſhe was delyuered
and churched ſhe knewe nothynge therof / 
whiche tyme ſhe had a doughter. The phyſycion
mayſter Guyllyam / who had the chefe
charge of healynge of the kynge / was ſtyll aboute
hym / and was ryght dyligent / and well
acquyted hymſelfe / wherby he gate bothe honour
and profyte / for lytell & lytell he brought
the kynge in good eſtate / and toke away the ſeuer
and the heate / and made hym to haue taſte
and appetyte to eate and drinke / ſlepe & reſt / 
and knowledge of euery thynge. howe be it he
was very feble / and lytell and lytell he made
the Kynge to ryde a huntynge and on hawkynge.
And whanne tydynges was knowen
through Fraunce howe the kynge was well
mended / and had his memory agayne / euery
man was ioyfull / and thanked god. the kyng
thus beyng at Crayell / deſyred to ſe the quene

his wyfe and the Dolphyn his ſonne. So the
quene came thyder to him / and the chylde was
brought thyder. The kynge made them good
chere / and ſo lytell and lytell through the helpe
of god / the kynge recouered his helthe. And
whan mayſter Guyllyam ſawe the kynge in
ſo good caſe / he was ryght ioyfull / as reaſone
was / for he had done a fayre cure / and ſo delyuered
hym to the dukes of Orlyance / Berrey / 
Burgoyne / and Burbone / and ſayd. My lordes / 
thanked be god the kyng is nowe in good
ſtate and helth / ſo I delyuer hym / but beware
lette no man dyſpleaſe hym / for as yet his ſpyrytes
be nat fully ferme nor ſtable / but lytell
and lytell he ſhall waxe ſtronge. Reaſonable
dyſporte / reſt / and myrthe ſhall be moſte profytable
for hym / and trouble hym as lytell as
may be with any counſayles / for he hath been
ſharpely handeled with a hote malady. Than
it was conſydred to retaygne this mayſter
Guylliam / and to gyue hym that he ſhulde be
contente with all / whiche is the ende that all
phyſicions requyre / to haue gyftes and rewardes.
He was deſyred to abyde ſtyll aboute the
kynge / but he excuſed himſelfe and ſayd howe
he was an olde impotent man / and coulde nat
endure the maner of courte / wherfore he deſyred
to returne in to his owne countrey. Whan
the counſayle ſawe he wolde none otherwyſe
do / they gaue him leaue / and at his departing
gaue him a thouſande crownes / and retayned
hym in wages with four horſes whan ſo euer
he wolde reſorte to the courte. Howe be it I beleue
he neuer came there after / for whan he retourned
to the cytie of Laon / there he contynued
and dyed a ryche man. He lefte behynde
hym a .xxx. thouſande frankes. All his dayes
he was one of the greateſt nygardes that euer
was / all his pleaſure was to get good / and to
ſpende nothynge / for in his howſe he neuer
ſpente paſt two ſouſes of Parys in a day / but
wolde eate and drinke in other mennes howſes / 
where as he myght get it. With this rodde
lyghtly all phyſicyons are beaten.

purpoſe the erle of ſaynt Poll / the lorde of Caſtell

ambaſſadours of Fraūce had ben in Englande
with the duke of Lancaſtre and the duke of

and the opynion of the cōmons of Englande / 
for at the comunycacyon and parlyamente at
Amyence / they were at a poynte of agrement
of peace / vpon certayne artycles ſpecifyed / reſeruynge
the agrement therto of the cōmons
of Englande. thus theſe ambaſſadours were
retourned in to Fraunce / and were anſwered
howe that at the feeſt of ſaynt Mychell nexte

howe be it kynge Rycharde of Englande /

that if / fortune ſhuld turne agaynſt ye englyſſh
party / that great dōmage therof ſhulde enſue / 
and parceyued well that the kyng his nephue
was enclyned moche rather to the peace than
to the warre. I Iohan Froyſart auctoure of
this hyſtory / canne nat well ſaye / whether this
dukes opinyon was good or nat / but it was
ſhewed me that bycauſe the duke of Lancaſtre
ſawe his two doughters maryed in higher degree
than hymſelfe / and out of the realme of
Englande / the one was quene of Spaygne / 
the other Quene of Portugale. This cauſed
him gretly to enclyne to the peace / for he knew
well that the kynge of Spaygnes ſonne / who
had maryed his doughter / was as than but
yonge / and in daunger of his owne ſubgiettes / 
and knewe well that if he ſhulde peaſably
enioye the herytage of Spaygne / it was conuenyente
that the englyſſhe men ſhulde kepe
the peace with Fraunce / for if the peace ſhulde
be broken by any incydent / than the Frenche
men myght ſhortly be reuenged of the realme
of Spayne, for they had open entrees as well
through Aragon and Chathalone / as Bierne
and Byſkay / for the lady yolant of Bare was
quene of Aragone / and ſhe was good frenche
and gouerned Aragon / Chathalone / Bierne / 
and Byſkay / for the Vycount of Chatellon / 
who was heyre to therle of Foiz had ſo ſworne
and promyſed the frenche quene / wherby the
frenche men hadde many fayre entrees in to
Spaygne without daunger of the kynge of
Nauer / who wolde nat wyllyngly dyſpleaſe
the frenche kynge his coſyn germayne / for as
than ſyr Peter of Nauerre his brother / was
with the frenche kynge / who alwayes apeaſed
the frenche kynges ire and dyſpleaſure / whan
he had any to his brother the Kynge of Nauer / 
for he was a true frenche man / and neuer
founde the contrary. All theſe imagynacions
the duke of Lancaſtre had in hym ſelfe / and
ſhewed his mynde to his ſonne the erle of Derby / 
though he were but yonge / yet he was of
great wyſdome / and lykely to come to great
honour / whiche erle had thre ſonne / Iohan / 
Humfrey / and Thomas / and two doughters
by the lady his wyfe / doughter and heyre to
the Erle conſtable of Englande / erle of Herforde
and Northampton / by whiche lady he
helde great herytage.
            THe concluſyon of the parlyament holden
at Weſtmynſter by the thre eſtates
of the realme. A trewce was taken by ſee and
by lande / bytwene Fraunce and Englande / 
their frendes and alyes / to endure fro the feeſt
of ſaynt Mychell / to the feeſt of ſaynt Iohan
Baptyſt nexte after / and ſuche cōmyſſioners
as the frenche kynge had ſent to this parlyament
were dyſpatched / and the charter of the
truce ſent by them ſealed / whiche treuce was
well vpholden on all partyes. The Frenche
kynge was ſore febled by reaſon of his ſyckeneſſe / 
and the phyſicyon mayſter Guyllyam
Harſelay was as than deed / but whan he departed
fro Crayell fro the kynge / he ordeyned
many receytes for the kynge to vſe / wherby in
the wynter ſeaſon he recouered his helth / wherof
all his louers and frendes reioyſed / with
the hole cōmynalte of Fraūce / for he was well
be loued / and ſo he and the quene came to Parys / 
and helde their houſeholde moſt parte at
ſaynt Powle / and ſomtyme at Loure / and the

longe wynter nyghtes they paſſed the ſeaſon
with daunſynge and carollynge / and other reuels
and dyſportes. The quene was acompaned
with the ducheſſe of Berrey / the ducheſſe
of Orlyance / and other ladyes. The ſame ſeaſon
the Vycount of Chaſtellon was come to
Parys / who was newly entred in to the herytage
of the erledome of Foize and of Bierne / 
as ryght heyre / and he releued the ſayde erledom
of Foiz / and dyd his homage to the kyng
but nat for Bierne / for that coūtrey helde themſelfe
of ſo noble condycion / that they helde ſeruyce
to no man lyuynge. Howe be it the prince
of Wales ſaid to the erle of Foiz that laſt dyed / 
that he ought to releue of him / and to haue his
reſorte to the Duchy of Acquitayne. But alwayes
the ſayd erle denyed and defended it.
And it is to be thought that the chalenge that
the prince of Wales made thervnto / was by
the ſettynge on and mouyng of Iohan erle of
Armynake / as it hath ben ſhewed here before
in this hiſtory / wherfore as nowe I wyll ouer
paſſe it. Whan this vicount of Chaſtellon (called
fro henſeforthe erle of Foiz) was at Paris
with the frenche kyng / he had there in his company
with hym his coſyn ſyr yuan of Foize / 
baſtarde ſonne to the laſte Erle of Foize / who
was a goodly knyght. The erle of Foiz or he
dyed wolde haue made hym his heyre / with a
nother of his baſtarde ſonnes called Gracian / 
who dwelte as than with the kyng of Nauer / 
but the knyghtes of Bierne wolde neuer conſent
therto / therfore the mater reſted as it dyd / 
and the erle dyed ſodaynly (as ye haue herde
before) Whan the Frenche kynge ſawe this
yonge knyght ſyr yuan of Foiz / he lyked hym
marueylous well / alſo the kynge and he were
moche of one age / and by reaſon of the fauour
that the kynge bare to this yonge knyght / the
erle of Foiz had the ſhorter ſpede / and was
delyuered of all his buſineſſe / and than
departed in to his owne countrey / 
and ſyr yuan abode ſtyll with
the kynge / and retayned
as one of his
knyghtes of
his chambre / 
with .xii. horſes / & all other
thynges therto belongynge.
         
         
            ¶Of the aduenture of a daunce that
was made at Parys in lykeneſſe of
wodehowſes / wherin the Frenche
Kynge was in parell of dethe.
Cap. C.xcii.
            
               IT fortuned / that ſone
after the retaynmge of this
foreſayd knyght / a maryage
was made in the kynges
houſe / bytwen a yonge
knyght of Vermandoys / 
and one of the quenes gentylwomen
/ and bycauſe they were bothe of the
kynges houſe / the kinges vncles and other lordes / 
ladyes / and damoſelles made great tryumphe.
There was the dukes of Orlyaunce / 
Berrey / and Burgoyne / & their wyues / daunſynge
and makynge great ioye. The kynge
made a great ſupper to the lordes and ladyes
and the quene kepte her eſtate / deſirynge euery
man to be mery. And there was a ſquyer of
Normandy called Hogreymen of Genſay / he
aduyſed to make ſome paſtyme. The daye of
the maryage whiche was on a tueſday before
Candelmas / he prouyded for a mummery agaynſt
nyght. He deuyſed ſyxe cotes made of
lynen clothe / couered with pytche and theron
flare lyke heare / and had them redy in a chambre.
The kynge put on one of them / and therle
of Iouy / a yonge luſty knyght another / and
ſyr Charles of Poicters the thyrde / who was
ſonne to the erle of Valentenoys / and to ſyr yuan
of Foiz another / and the ſonne of the lord
Nanthorillet had on the fyfte / and the ſquyer
hym ſelfe had on the ſyxte. And whan they
where thus arayed in theſe ſayd cotes and ſowed
faſt in them / they ſemed lyke wylde wode
houſes full of beare fro the toppe of the heed to
the ſowle of ye foote. This deuyſe pleaſed well
the frenche kynge / and was well content with
the ſquyer for it. They were aparelled in theſe
cotes ſecretly in a chamre that no man knewe
therof / but ſuch as holpe them. Whan ſyr yuan
of Foiz had well aduyſed theſe cores / he ſayd
to the kynge. Syr cōmaunde ſtraytely that
no man aproche nere vs with any torches or
fyre / for if the fyre faſten in any of theſe cotes / 
we ſhall all be brent without remedy. the king
aunſwered and ſayd / yuan ye ſpeke well and

wyſely / it ſhall be doone as ye haue deuyſed / 
and incontynent ſent for an vſſher of his chambre / 
cōmaundyng him to go in to the chambre
where the ladyes daūſed / and to cōmaunde all
the varlettes holdinge torches to ſtande vp by
the walles / and none of them to aproche nere
to the wovehouſes that ſhulde come thyder to
daunce. The vſſher dyd the kynges cōmaundement / 
whiche was fulfylled. Sone after the
duke of Orlyance entred in to the hall / acompanyed
with four knyghtes and ſyxe torches
and knewe nothynge of the kynges cōmaundement
for the torches / nor of the mummery
that was cōmynge thyder / but thought to be
holde the daunſynge / and began hym ſelfe to
daunce. Therwith the kynge with the fyue other
came in / they were ſo dyſguyſed in flaxe
that no man knewe them. Fyue of them were
faſtened one to another. The kynge was loſe
and went before and led the deuyſe.
            WHan they entred in to the hall euery
man teke ſo great hede to them / that
they forgate the torches. The kynge
departed fro his company and went to the ladyes
to ſporte with them / as youth requyred / 
and ſo paſſed by the quene and came to the ducheſſe
of Berrey / who toke and helde hym by
the arme to knowe what he was / but the kyng
wolde nat ſhewe his name. Than the duches
ſayd / ye ſhall nat eſcape me tyll I knowe your
name. In this meane ſeaſon great myſchyefe
fell on the other / and by reaſon of the duke of
Orlyance / howe be it / it was by ignoraunce / 
and agaynſt his wyll / for if he had conſydred
before the miſchefe that 
                  •
               ell / he wolde nat haue
done as he dyd for all the good in the worlde / 
but he was ſo deſyrous to knowe what perſonages
the fyue were that daunced / he put one
of the torches that his ſeruaūtes helde ſo nere / 
that the heate of the fyre entred in to the flaxe
(wherin if fyre take / there is no remedy) and
ſodaynly was on a bright flame / and ſo eche
of them ſet fyre on other / the pytche was ſo faſtened
to the lynen clothe and their ſhyrtes ſo
drye and fyne / and ſo ioynynge to their fleſſhe
that they began to brenne and to cry for helpe.
None durſte come nere theym / they that dyd
brente their handes / by reaſon of the heate of
the pytche. One of them called Nanthorillet / 
aduyſed hym howe the botry was therby / he
fled thyder / and caſt himſelfe in to a veſſell full
of water / wherin they rynſed pottes / whiche
ſaued hym / or els he had ben deed as the other
were / yet he was ſore hurt with the fyre. whan
the quene herde the crye that they made / ſhe
douted her of the Kynge / for ſhe knewe well
that he ſhulde be one of the ſyxe / wherwith ſhe
fell in a ſowne / and knightes and ladyes came
and comforted her. a pyteous noyſe there was
in the hall. The ducheſſe of Berrey delyuered
the kynge fro that parell / for ſhe dyd caſte ouer
him the trayne of her gowne / and couered him
fro the fyre. The kynge wolde haue gone fro
her. Whyder wyll ye go quod ſhe / ye ſe well
howe your company brennes? What are ye? I
am the kyng quod he. Haſte you quod ſhe and
gette you in to other apparell / that the quene
maye ſe you / for ſhe is in great feare of you.
Therwith the kynge departed out of the hall / 
and in all haſte chaunged his apparell / and
came to the quene. And the ducheſſe of Berrey
had ſomwhat comforted her / and had ſhewed
her howe ſhe ſhulde ſe the kynge ſhortely.
Therwith the kynge came to the quene / and
as ſoone as ſhe ſawe hym / for ioy ſhe enbraſed
hym and fell in a ſowne. Than ſhe was borne
in to her chambre / and the kynge wente with
her. And the baſtarde of Foiz who was all on
a fyre / cryed euer with a loude voyce. ſaue the
kynge / ſaue the kynge. Thus was the kynge
ſaued. It was happy for hym that he went fro
his company / for els he had ben deed without
remedy. This great myſcheife fell thus about
mydnyght in the hall of ſaynt Powle in Parys / 
where there was two brente to dethe in
the place / and other two / the baſtarde of Foiz
and the erle of Iouy borne to their lodgynges
and dyed within two dayes after in gret myſery
and payne. Thus the feeſt of this maryage
brake vp in beuyneſſe / howe be it there
was no remedy. The faulte was onely in the
duke of Orlyaunce / and yet he thought none
yuell whanne he put downe the torche. Than
the duke ſayde. Syrs lette euery man knowe
there is no man to blame for this cauſe but all
onely my ſelfe / I ame ſory therof. If I had
thought as moche before / it ſhulde nat haue
happened. Than the duke of Orlyaunce went
to the kynge to excuſe hym / and the kyng toke
his excuſe. This caſe fell in the yere of oure
lorde god a thouſande thre hundred fourſcore
and twelue / the tueſday before the feeſt of Candelmas / 
of whiche fortune great brute ſpredde

abrode in the realme of Fraūce / and in other
countreys. The dukes of Burgoyne and
of Berrey were nat there preſent at that ſeaſon / 
They hadde taken their leaue before of
the kyng / and were gone to their lodginges.
            THe next daye theſe newes ſpredde abrode
in the cytie / and euery manne
had merueyle therof. and ſome ſayd
howe God had ſente that token for an enſample / 
and that it was wyſedome for the kynge
to regarde it / and to withdrawe hym ſelfe
fro ſuche yonge ydell wantonneſſe / whiche
he had vſed ouermoche beynge a kyng. The
cōmons of the cytie of Parys murmured &
ſayd. Beholde the great myſhappe and myſchiefe
that was lykely to haue fallen on the
kynge / He myght as well haue been brent as
other were. What ſhulde haue fallen than of
the kynges vncles and of his brother. They
myght haue ben ſure none of them ſhulde haue
ſcaped the dethe: yea / and all the knyghtes
that myght haue been founde in Parys?
As ſoone as the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne
herde of that aduenture / they were abaſſhed
and marueyled greatly. They lepte
on their horſes and rode to the kyng / and cō
               forted
and counſayled hym / whiche was neceſſary / 
for he was ſore troubled / and the paryll
that he was in / was ſtyll in his ymaginacion / 
he ſhewed his vncles howe his aunt
of Berrey had ſaued hym. But he ſayde he
was very ſorie for the dethe of the erle of Iouye / 
of ſir yuan of Foiz / and of ſir Charles
of Poicters. His vncles reconforted hym &
ſayde. Sir / that is loſte canne nat be recouered:
ye muſte forgette the dethe of them / and
thanke god of the fayre aduenture that is fallen
to your owne perſone. For all the realme
of Fraunce by this incydent myght haue ben
in great daunger of leſynge. For ye maye
thynke well that theſe people of Parys wyll
neuer be ſtyll / for God knoweth / if the myſfortune
had fallen on you / they wolde haue
ſlayne vs all. Theriore ſir / aparell you in
eſtate royall and lepe on your horſe and ryde
to our lady in pylgrimage / and we ſhall accompany
you / and ſhewe youre ſelfe to the
people / for they deſyre ſoore to ſe you. The
kynge ſayde he wolde ſo do. Than the kynges
vncles toke aparte the duke of Orlyaūce
and in curteſſe maner ſomwhat blamed hym
of his yonge dede that he had done. He aunſwered
and ſayde / howe he thought to haue
done none yuell. Than anone 
                  〈◊〉
                ye kynge
and his company lepte on their horſes / and
rode throughe the cytie to apeaſe the people / 
and came to our lady Churche / & there herde
maſſe and offred / and thanne retourned agayne
to the houſe of ſaynt Poule / and lytell
and lytell this mater was forgotten / and the
obſequyes done for the deed bodyes.
            Ah erle Gaſcoyne of Foiz / if this had fortuned
in thy lyfe dayes / thou ſhuldeſt haue
had great diſpleaſure / and it had been harde
to haue peaſed the / for thou louedeſt hym entierly.
All lordes and ladyes through the realme
of Fraūce / and elſwhere / that herde of
this chaunce had great marueyle therof.

the pope at Auygnon / who was proude and
preſumptuous / and neuer had done good in

ought to be illumyned and ayded. Wherfore
they charged this frere to go in to Fraūce / 
and delyuered hym inſtructions of the effecte

            NAtwithſtandyng / for all theſe aduē

ſaid / that they ſhulde be put to dethe / and delyuered

it was ordayned / that as ſone as they ſhulde

openly as traytours agaynſt ye crowne

had nat prouyded for them. And at the ſpeciall
inſtaunce and requeſt of the ducheſſe of
Berrey: for and ſhe had nat ben / their dethe
had been haſted. ſpecially ſhe prayed for the
lorde de la Riuer / for by his meanes ſhe was
brought in to Fraunce / & the maryage made
bytwene the duke of Berrey and her. She
ſayde on a tyme to the duke her huſbande all
wepyng. Sir / that is layd to the lordes de la

Thoughe all his landes and goodes be taken

Than he had pytie and ſwaged his diſpleaſure / 
and the lorde de la Ryuer had been the
ſones delyuered and ſir Iohan Mercier had
nat been / for they ſought all the wayes that
myght be / to haue putte hym to dethe / whiche
they coude nat do / without bothe ſhulde

            THis ſir Iohan Mercyer hadde wept
ſo moche in priſon / that his ſight was
therby ſore febled. It they had folowed the
ducheſſe of Burgoyns counſayle / they had
ben putte to execucyon longe before ſhamefully / 
without fauour. For ſhe hared them / 
bycauſe they and ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon had
counſayled the kynge to go in to Bretaygne
to warre agaynſt her coſyn the duke. Alſo
ſhe ſayde / that Clyſſon / le Ryuer / and Mercyer / 
were cauſers of the kynges maladye / 
howe be it the kyng was well recouered and
in good eſtate. The dukes of Berrey and
Burgoyne kepte ſtyll the gouernaūce of the
realme of Fraunce / for they had great profyte
therby. They had apoynted ſuche perſones
as them pleaſed to be about the kyng.
            In thoſe dayes the kynge bare the name of

And ſhe ſayde to ſuche as were ſecrete with

in no condycion to go before me / nor is nat ſo
nyghe to the crowne (as I am). My lorde
my huſbande is brother to the kynge / and it
myght ſo fall / that he ſhulde be kynge and I
quene: I wotte nat why ſhe ſhulde take on
her this honour / and put me behynde? Thus
ſome enuy was amonge theſe ladyes.
            ¶Nowe lette vs leaue ſpeakynge of them / 
and retourne to ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon.
            
               YE haue herde howe he was ſommoned
fyftene dayes to apere in

ſir Philyppe of Sauoiſes and other / who

in all places / but they founde hym nat / for he
hydde hym ſelfe ſo couertly / that they coulde
neuer ſpeke with hym / for if they hadde / they
wolde haue reſted hym. At their retourne
in to Fraunce / they made relacyon of their
voyage. Than it was iudged by the lordes
of the parlyament / that ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon
Conſtable of Fraunce / hadde forfayted
landes / lyfe / and goodes: And ſo iuged hym
to be banyſſhed for euer out of the realme of
Fraunce / and to leſe all his offyces and herytages
within the realme. And bicauſe he had
nat ſente the Martell / whiche is the token of

the offyce of the Conſtablery / as he was ſō
               moned
to do: therfore the offyce was vacant
and voyde. Than the dukes and their counſayls / 
ſuche as were agaynſt ſir Olyuer of

perſon to occupy the ſaid offyce / whiche was
ſo noble and of ſo gret renome / that it might
nat long be without a gouernour / for the incidentes
that myght happe to fall. They aduyſed
that the lorde Coucy was a mete man
for it / and layde it to hym / but he excuſed him
ſelfe and ſayd / that in no wyſe he wolde medyll

the lorde Philyppe of Arthoys
& the yong wydowe
lady of Berrey / ſomtyme
called coūteſſe of Dunoys
and wyfe to Loyes of Bloys. The Frenche
kynge wolde gladly haue had this maryage
auaunſed / but the duke of Berrey was natre
wyllynge therto / for he thought the erldome
of Ewe but a ſmall thyng / as to the regarde
of her fyrſte huſbande / wherfore he thought
to mary her more highlyer. In dede the lady
was beautifull & endued with all vertues / yt
ſhulde aperteyne to a noble lady. Howe be

                  •
               rayned hym ſelfe of makynge of any promyſe / 
to any perſone for his doughter. Alſo
he ſawe well that the kynge enclyned his fauour
to his coſyn the lorde Philyppe of Arthois / 
who was a yonge luſty knyght and of
highe corage / and hadde endured many traueyls
in armes / beyond the ſee and other places / 
and had atchyued many voyages to his
great laude and honour. Than the dukes of
Berrey and Burgoyne agreed bytwene thē / 
that if the kynge wolde gyue to their coſyn
Philyppe of Arthois / the offyce of Conſtablery
of Fraunce / whiche as than they reputed
voyde / by reaſon of the forfayture of ſir
Olyuer of Clyſſon / than they to agree at the
kynges pleaſure in this ſayd maryage. For
the duke of Berrey thought / that if he were
conſtable of Fraūce / he ſhulde than haue ſuffycient
to mentayne his eſtate. On this the
two dukes determyned to ſpeke to the kynge
and ſo they dyde / and ſaid to hym. Sir / your
counſayle generally are all agreed / that the
lorde Philyp of Arthoys be preferred to the
offyce of conſtableſhyp of Fraunce / whiche
is nowe voyde. For by iugement of your ꝑlyament / 
Olyuer of Clyſſon hath forfayted ye
offyce / whiche maye nat be long vacant / but
it ſhulde be preiudyce to the realme. And ſir / 
bothe you and we alſo are bounde to auaūce
and promote our coſyn of Arthoys / for he is
nere of blode and of lynage to vs. And ſir / ſeing
the office is voyde / we can nat tell where
ye ſhulde better enploy it / than on hym. He
ſhall right well exerciſe it: he is welbeloued
with knyghtes and ſquiers: and he is a man
without enuy or couytouſneſſe. Theſe wordes
pleaſed well the kyng / who anſwered &
ſaid. Vncle (if it voyde) we had rather he
had it than another. The kyngꝭ vncles ſued
ſtyll for the lorde Philyppe of Arthoys / for
the duke of Berrey hated ſir Olyuer of Cliſſon / 
bycauſe he conſented to diſtroye Betyſache
his ſeruaunte. And the duke of Burgoyne
hated hym / bycauſe he made warre

agaynſt the duke of Bretaygne / and yet the
ducheſſe hated hym worſe. Finally the kyng
aſſented / ſo that the duke of Berrey wolde agre
to the maryage / bytwene his doughter &
the ſaid lorde Philyppe of Arthoys. And yet
to ſatiſfye the kyng and the duke of Orlyaū
               ce / 
who bare ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon in that offyce.
They ſente ſir Guyllyam of Bourdes
and ſir Guyllyam Martell / bothe knyghtes
of the kynges chambre. And ſir Philyppe of
Sauoiſes a knyght of the duke of Berreys
in to Bretaygne / to ſpeke with ſir Olyuer of
Clyſſon. Theſe knyghtes tooke their iourney
and rode to Angers / and there they foūd
the quene of Hieruſalem and Iohan of Bretaygne / 
who receyued them right honorably
for the honour of the Frenche kynge. There
they taryed two dayes / and demaunded newes
of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon. Sayeng they
had curteſſe letters and meſſage fro the Frē
               che
kyng to hym / and fro none other perſone
And they were aunſwered no man coude tell
where he was / but that he was ſurely in Bretayne / 
in one of his fortreſſes. But they ſaid
he was ſo flyttyng fro one place to another / 
that it was harde to fynde hym. Than theſe
knightes departed and toke leaue of ye quene
and of her ſonne Charles the prince of Thatent / 
and of Iohan of Bretaygne erle of Pō
               thieu / 
and rode to Rennes. And the duke of
Bretayne and the ducheſſe were at Wannes
and rode nat lightly forthe out of the towne / 
for he euer douted the buſſhmentes of his ennemye
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon. There was ſo
harde warre made bytwene them / that there
was no mercy but dethe. And thoughe the
duke was lorde and ſouerayne of the countrey / 
yet there was neyther barone / knyght / 
nor ſquyer in Bretaygne / that wolde arme
them agaynſt ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / but diſſymuled
and ſayde / that their warre touched
them nothyng / wherfore they ſatte ſtyll. The
duke coude haue none other conforte.
            
               WHan̄e theſe Frenche knyghtes
were at Rennes: they enquered
where to fynde ſir Olyuer of
Clyſſon / but they coude here no
certentie of hym. Thanne they
were coūſayled to drawe to the caſtell of Ioſelyn / 
where ſir Olyuer of Clyſſons men receyued
them well / for the loue of the Frenche
kynge. Than they demaunded where they
myght here of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / Sayeng
they had to ſpeke with hym / fro the frenche
kynge and from the duke of Orlyaunce / 
and from none other perſones. But his men
coude tell nothyng of hym / or els they wolde
nat tell. But they ſayd. ſirs / ſurely it wyll be
harde to fynde hym / for this daye he is in one
place / and to morowe in another. But if it
pleaſe you / ye maye ryde ouer all the duchy
of Bretaygne / and ſertche ouer all his fortereſſes
and houſes / none ſhall be cloſed agaynſt
you. Whan they ſawe they coulde haue
none other aunſwere they departed thens / &
rode and viſyted all the fortreſſes great and
ſmall / parteynynge to the lorde Olyuer of
Clyſſon. Than̄e they came to Wannes / and
there founde the duke of Bretaygne and the
ducheſſe / who receyued them / and there they
taryed but halfe a daye / and dyſcouered nat
to the duke / the ſecrete mater that they came
thyder for / nor alſo the duke examyned them
nothynge of the mater. Alſo they coulde nat
ſe there ſir Peter of Craon.
            THus they toke leaue of the duke and
of the ducheſſe and retourned to Parys / 
where they foūde the kyng and
the lordes / and there reported to the kynge &
to the duke of Orlyaunce / howe they hadde
ſought all the places and townes parteynynge
to ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / but in no wyſe
they coulde fynde hym. The dukes of Burgoyn
and Berrey were right gladde of theſe
newes / and wolde nat it had ben otherwiſe.
Than anone after proceded the maryage bytwene
the lorde Philippe of Arthois and the
lady Mary of Berrey. and ſo this lorde Philyppe
was Conſtable of Fraunce / and vſed
the offyce / with all profytes and aduauntages
therto belongyng / of auncyent ordynaū
               ces.
yet the lorde Olyuer of Clyſſon had nat
renounced the offyce / nor delyuered vp the
Martell / whiche is the token of the Conſtable
of Fraunce. For he contynued / and ſayd
he wolde abyde ſtyll Cōſtable / and had done
no cauſe why to leſe it / nouther to the kynge
nor to the realme. He knewe well the erle of
Ewe was profered to haue the offyce of the
Conſtable / and to enioye the profyttes therof / 
by conſente of the Kynge / and howe he
hadde maryed the doughter of the Duke of

Berrey the lady Mary. He toke but lytell regarde
to all this / for he knewe hym ſelfe true
to the kynge / and to the crowne of Fraunce.
And knewe well / all that was done agaynſt
hym was through enuy and hatered / that the
dukes of Burg
                  •
               yne and Berey had againſt
hym. Thus the lorde of Clyſſon lette the mater
paſſe / and contynued ſtyll his warre agaynſt
ye duke of Bretayne / whiche warre was
right fierſe and cruell / without mercy or pytie.
The lorde of Clyſſon rode ofter abrode
and layde buſſhmentes / than the duke dyde.
And all other lordes of Bretayne ſatte ſtyll &
wolde nat medyll. The duke dyde ſende for
the lordes of his countrey / and they came to
ſpeke with hym / & to knowe his entent. than
the duke requyred them of their ayde & helpe
agaynſt his ennemy ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon.
Than the lordes of Bretayne / as the vicoūt
of Rohan / the lorde Dignan / the lorde Hermen
of Lyon / and dyuers other excuſed them
and ſayd. they knewe no cauſe why / nor they
wolde nat make no warre agaynſt the lorde
Clyſſon / but they ſaid they wolde right gladlye
endenour them ſelfes to bringe them to a
peace / if they coude. Whan the duke ſawe he
coude haue none other conforte of them / and
parceyued well howe he loſt and was lykely
to leſe mo men in that warre than ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon / than he conſented that the ſayde
lordes ſhulde go to ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon &
treate for a peace / and to bringe hym vnder
ſaueconducte to Wannes to ſpeke with hym / 
at whiche tyme he ſayd he ſhulde be founde
tretable / and to agre to all reaſon. And if ſir
Olyuer had done hym any diſpleaſure / that
he myght haue amendes accordynge to their
aduyſe. Theſe lordes were well agreed thus
to do / and ſo they all thre wente to the lorde
Olyuer of Clyſſon / and dyde ſo moche that
they ſpake with hym (as I was enformed)
in the caſtell of Io
                  •
               elyn / and ſhewed him the
dukes entent. And moreouer to bringe them
to a peace (for they ſawe well warr̄ was nat
fytting bytwene them / but greatly noyed the
noble men / marchaūtes / and cōmons of Bretaygne)
they ſayd to the lorde Olyuer. Sir / 
if it wyll pleaſe you to go to ye duke / we ſhall
bynde vs to abide here ī this caſtell tyll your
retourne. And we doute nat / ye beynge ones
in his preſence / ye ſhall fynde him ſo reſonable / 
that peace and good accorde ſhalbe had
bitwene you. Sir Olyuer ſayd. Sirs what
ſhall it profyte you if I were deed? Thynke
you that I knowe nat the duke of Bretayne?
He is ſo cruell and ſo haute / that for all his
ſaueconducte / or what ſoeuer he ſaythe / if he
ſawe me in his preſēce / he wolde neuer ceaſe
tyll I were deed: and than̄e ſhulde you dye
lykewiſe / for my men here wolde ſoone ſlee
you without mercy. Wherfore it is beſt that
bothe you and I ſaue our lyues / rather than
to putte vs in that daunger. I ſhall kepe me
fro hym and I can / and lette hym kepe hym
as well fro me. Than̄e the lorde Charles of
Dignan ſayde. Fayre coſyn / ye may ſaye as
it pleaſe you / but we thynke ſurely thoughe
he ſawe you / he wolde do you no diſpleaſure
This that we offre you is of good affection / 
and to bringe you to accorde / and we praye
you that ye wyll thus do. Than ye lorde Clyſſon
ſayde. Sirs / I beleue ſurely ye meane
well / but I enſure you vpon this aſſuraunce
I ſhall neuer go to hym. But ſithe ye medell
in the mater bytwene vs / we ſhall nat thynke
that I ſhalbe vnreſonable. I ſhall tell you
what I wyll do. Retourne you agayn to the
duke / and ſaye that I wyll nat take you for
no pledge nor hoſtage. Lette hym ſende me
his ſonne and heyre / who is maryed to the
doughter of Fraūce / and he ſhall abyde here
in this caſtell with my men / tyll I retourne
agayne. This way I thynke more ſurer thā
the other / for if ye ſhulde abyde here (as ye
offre) Who ſhulde than̄e entremedell in the
buſyneſſe bytwene ye duke and me? For without
a meane we ſhall neuer come to accorde.
            WHan theſe lordes of Bretayne ſawe
they coude haue non other anſwere
they tooke their leaues and retourned
to Wānes to the duke / and ſhewed hym
what they had done / but in no wyſe the duke
wolde conſente to ſende his ſonne to the caſtell
of Ioſelyn. So their warre contynued
ſtyll / wherby no perſone durſt ryde abrode / 
and marchaundyſe was layde downe / thoroughe
whiche the people of good townes &
cyties were ſore hindred / and poore laborers
lette laboringe of the erthe. The ducheſſe of
Burgoyn couertly ayded her coſyn the duke
of Bretayne wt men of armes / aſwell of Burgoyne
as of other places. for the duke coude
get none of his countrey to take his parte in

that quarell agaynſt ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon.
They alwayes diſſymuled the mater except
ſuche as were of his owne houſe. The duke
of Orlyaunce on the other parte / loued well
the lorde Olyuer of Clyiſon / and ſecretely ſo
coured hym with men / and ſente hym horſes.
Sir Olyuer of Glyſſon roode ofter abrode
than the duke dyde. And it fortuned on a day
he encountred two ſquyers of the dukes / the
one called Ber
                  •
               ard & the other yuonet. they
were taken and brought to ſir Olyuer / who
was gladde of them: He knewe them well / 
one of them hadde done hym ſeruyce in tyme
paſt / and the other nat / but he had done hym
diſpleaſure. Than ſir Olyuer ſaid to yuonet
Remembreſt thou nat howe in the Caſtell of
Ermyne thou ſheweddeſt me but ſmall curteſy:
and thou Bernarde haddeſt pyte on me
and dyddeſt putte of thy gowne and putte it
on me / whā I ſtode in my doublet on ye pauement / 
the whiche kepte me fro colde. I wyll
nowe yelde thy curteſy to the / thy lyfe ſhalbe
ſaued. but thou falſe knaue and traitour yuo
net / thou myghteſt haue done otherwyſe thā
thou dyddeſt / therfore thou ſhalte repent it / 
and therwith drewe his dagger and ſtrake
hym to the herte. Another tyme ye lorde Cliſſon
rode with thre hundred ſpeares in his cō
               pany / 
towarde the caſtell of Alroy / where the
duke and ducheſſe of Bretayne were. This
was aboute Mydſomer / and by fortune he
encountred a fourtie of the Dukes ſeruauntes / 
who hadde tyed their horſes to the trees / 
and had ſickels in their hādes / and were cuttyng
downe the corne / and makynge truſſes
to cary to their lodgynges lyke forragers.
Whan the lorde Olyuer came on them / they
were ſore afrayde / and the lorde Oliuer ſaid
Sirs / howe dare ye come in to the feldes / to
ſteale and to take awaye poore mēnes corne?
ye neuer ſowed them / and yet ye cutte theym
downe or they be type: ye begyn harueſt to
ſoone. Leape on your horſes and take youre
ſickels / for this tyme I wyll do you no hurt / 
and ſaye to the duke of Breraygne who is in
Alroy / that if he wyll come or ſende his men
to driue me away / here he ſhall fynde me tyll
the ſonne goynge downe. Theſe poore men
were gladde they were ſo delyuered / they feared
to haue ben ſlayne. So they retourned
to the caſtell of Alroy to ye 
               
                  ••
               ke / and ſhewed
hym what they hadde herde and ſene / but the
duke nor none of his men iſſued out of ye caſtell.
Many ſcrimyſſhes were made in Bretaygne / 
bytwene the duke and ſir Olyuer of
Clyſſon / and they of the countre medled nat
bytwene them. ¶Nowe we wyll leaue to
ſpeke of the duke of Bretayne and of ſir Oliuer
of Clyſſon / and of their warre / and ſpeke
of the buſyneſſe bytwene Englande & Frāce.

Cap. C.xcv.
            
               YE haue herde here before / 
howe the ꝑliamēt was holden in
the cytie of Amyence / and howe
the Englyſſhe lordes departed / 
and vpon what artycles. & howe
the Frenche kynge ſent after in to Englande
to the duke of Lācaſtre / and the anſwere that
they hadde of the Englyſſhmen / who were
harde to be brought to any peace. For it laye
nat all onely in the kyng nor in the dukes of
Lancaſtre and yorke / for great parte laye in
the commens of Englande and archers / and
other ſeruyng men. they ſayd howe they had
rather haue warre than peace / & many yong
knightes & ſquiers were of yt ſame opynion / 
for by reaſon of the warre they had maynteyned
their eſtates / howe be it ꝑforce they were
fayne to obey as the kyng & his vncles wolde
The duke of Lācaſtre bycauſe his .ii. doughters
were quenes / the one of Spaygne / the
of Portugale. And alſo bycauſe he ſawe the
kynge his nephue enclyned to haue peace / he
ſayd the warre had endured longe ynoughe / 
and ſayde he wolde take payne therin / ſo it
myght be for the honour of the kyng and the
realme. On the other partie the duke of Burgoyne
dyde all yt he myght do to haue peace / 
conſydring howe he was greatly charged wt
the buſyneſſe of Fraunce. And that his two
nephues / the Frenche kynge and the duke of
Orlyaunce were yonge of age and of diſcrecion.
Alſo he conſydred howe he was enherytour

to the duchy of Brabant / and thought / 
that if euer Flaunders and Brabant ſhulde
vary agaynſt the crowne of Fraūce with the
ayde of Englande / as they had other tymes
done before / that the realme of Fraunce ſhulde
than haue ouer moche to do. the duke of Burgoyne
was a wyſe and a farre caſtyng prince / 
and depely regarded his buſyneſſes. This duke
of Burgoyne and the duke of Lancaſtre / 
tooke great payne to haue a Parlyament agayn
to be holden at Balynghm̄ / whiche was
agreed / and bothe partyes ſuffycyently prouyded / 
with full auctorites to conclude a full
peace. And this counſayle to be holden at Balyngham / 
in the moneth of May than nexte
after / in the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and .xvii. and all ſuche
as ſhulde be at this aſſemble were named and
apoynted.
            FIrſte on the party of kynge Rycharde
kinge of Englande were apoynted his
two vncles / the duke of Lancaſtre and ye duke
of Glouceſtre / who were greatly in fauoure
with all the cōmons of England / and with all
ſuch yt loued berter to haue warre than peace.
and with them ſhulde be the archebyſſhop of
yorke / the byſſhop of London / and other clerkes
of the lawe. It was apoynted that theſe
lordes ſhulde come to Calays / as they dyd) aboute
the myddes of Aprill / anone after the
feeſt of ſaynte George / holden at the caſtell of
Wyndeſore / by the kynge and other knyghtes
of the ordre of the garter. And on the frenche
party there was aiſygned the dukes of Bertey
and Burgoyne to be there / and other counſaylours
of Fraūce / and it was ordeyned that
they ſhulde come to the towne of Boloyn / and
the frenche king / who (as he ſhewed had great
affection to haue peace bytwene Englāde and
hym) ſayde to his vncles / that he wolde come
as nere to the parlyament as he myght / wher
vpon it was aduyſed where the frenche kinge
ſhulde lye / the parlyament durynge at Balyngham.
Someſayd at ſaynt Omers / and
ſome ſayd at Thourayne / and ſome at Mutterell
or Abuyle. But all thynges conſydred / it
was aduyſed that the kynge ſhulde lye at Abuyle / 
bycauſe the towne was ſtronge and well
fournyſſhed / and there euery man ſhulde be
well lodged. Whan this was determyned drouſyon
was made there for the kynge / and he
to be lodged in the abbay of ſaynt Peters / an
abbay of blacke monkes / and thyder came the
kynge and the duke of Orlyaunce / and their
counſayle / and the lorde Reynolde of Corby / 
chauncellour of Fraunce. The dukes of Berrey
and of Burgoyne / and ſuche other as were
in their cōmyſſion / were at Boloyne. And the
dukes of Lancaſtre and Glouceſtre & other / 
were at Calays. It was goodly to beholde to
ſe the ordre of this parlyament that was holden
at Balyngham / bytwene the frenche men
and englyſſhmen. There were tentes and pauylyons
pyght vp / to refreſſhe bothe partyes / 
and twyſe or thryſe a weke the cōmyſſioners
mette there in a fayre tente / ordayned for that
purpoſe / aboute nyne of the clocke in the fore
noone / and there cōmuned vpon many artycles.
It whiche tyme I Iohan Froyſart (auctour
of this booke) was at Abuyle / and deſyrous
to knowe the effecte of this treatie / I enquyred
the trouth of ſuche lordes and other as
I thought ſhulde knowe the certayntie. Is it
was ſhewed me / whan they entred in to comunycaſion / 
and had ſene eche others auctoryte / 
and perceyued that they had full power to conclude
a peace / bothe by lande and ſee / bytwene
Fraunce and Englande / and all their alyes.
Than one of the firſte demaundes yt the frenche
men deſyred / was to haue Calays raced
downe / in ſuche maner that there ſhulde be neuer
after any habytacion there. Therto the dukes
of Lācaſtre and Glouceſtre anſwered and
ſaid / how they had no ſuche auctorite to cauſe
Calays to be beaten downe / but yt Englande
ſhulde holde it in his demayne and trewe herytage.
And ſayd / that if they purpoſed to entre
any further in tr
                  •
               atye of peace / to ſeace of
that demaunde / and to ſpeke no more therof.
Whan the Dukes 
                  〈◊〉
                Berrey and Burgoyne
herde their two coſyns of Englande anſwere
ſo quyckly in that 
                  〈◊〉
                / they ſeaſed to ſpeke any
more of that mat
                  •
               er / for they ſawe well their
traueyle ſhulde be but in vayne / and ſo than
ſpake of other matters. Than the englyſſhe
men demaunded to haue re
                  ••
               ytucyon of all
ſuche landes as had been delyuered to kynge
Rycharde their ſoueraygne lorde / or to kynge
Edwarde the thyrde / or to any of their deputies
or commyſſioners / and alſo to haue fully
payed the ſōme of florayns that was lefte vnpayed
at the tyme whan the warre renewed
bytwene England and Fraunce / and this the

englyſſhe clerkes and lawyers proued reaſonable
and lawfull to be had. The lordes and
chauncelours of Fraunce argued to the contrary / 
and ſayd / as to retourne all the landes
agayne to the gouernynge of the kyng of Englande
and his ſucceſſours / was impoſſyble
to be done / ſayenge howe ſuche landes / cyties / 
townes / caſtels / lordeſhyppes / and homages
as the Englyſſhe men demaunded / were gyuen
awaye whan the peace was concluded at
Bretygny / and after confermed and ſealed at
Calays / wherby they were clene put a way fro
the kyng of Englande / whiche peace & grauntes
was made in the yere of our lorde god a
thouſande thre hūdred threſcore and one / and
thervpon the frenche kyng graunted to ſuche
landes great lyberties / by his othe / writyng / 
and promeſſe / whiche in no wyſe canne be broken
agayne nor reuoked / wherfore they ſayd
that if the Englyſſhemen purpoſed to haue
peace / they ſhulde drawe to ſome nerer poynt.
Than by delyberacyon of the foure dukes / it
was deuyſed that the frenche men as well as
the englyſſhmen ſhulde put all their demaundes
in writynge / & the ſame to be delyuered to
eyther partye / that they might be regarded at
length on bothe partes / and ſuche as were vnreaſonable
to be raſed and cancelled / and ſuch
as were good to be vpholden. this ordynaūce
ſemed to all parties good and reaſonable. Before
this ordre was taken ye ſour dukes had to
moche buſyneſſe to do ſpecyally the englyſſhe
men had moche payne to here and to vnderſtande
the frenche men / who were full of ſubtyle
wordes / and cloked perſwacions and double
of vnderſtandynge / the whiche the frenche
men wolde rouine as they lyſt / to their profyte
and aduauntage whiche englyſſhe men vſe
nat in their langage / for their ſpeche and entent
is playne. And alſo the engliſſhmen were
enfourmed that the Frenche men had nat alwayes
vpholden the artycles / promyſes / and
condycyons / ratyfied in the artycles of peace / 
yet the frenchmen wold euer fynde one poynte
or other in their writynges / by ſome ſubtyle
cloked worde / affermynge that the englyſſhe
men had broken the peace / and nat they. Wherfore
whan the englyſſhe men ſawe or herde in
the frenche mens writynges any darke or cloked
worde / they made it to be examyned by
ſuche as were profoundly lerned in the lawe / 
and if they founde it a myſſe / they cauſed it to
be canſelled and amended / to the entent they
wolde leaue nothynge in trouble. And the englyſſhmen
to excuſe themſelfe / wolde ſay that
frenche men letnynge ſuche ſubtylties in their
youth / muſte nedes be more ſubtyle than they.
Somtyme ſuche frowarde wordes bytwene
the parties greatly draue of the tyme of treatie.
The frenche men helde them ſelfe fre / and
thought they ſhulde nat be charged with no
ſuche demaundes / as to make reſtytucy on of
all the landes / with the apendances pertaynyng
to the duchy of Acquytayne / with the arerages
of that hath ben leuyed ſyth the warre
renewed / to ye whiche they wolde neuer acorde.
The frenche men offred to rendre the countre
of Terbe and of Bygore / and the countye of
Piergourt and Pyergyns / and the countie of
Agen and Agenoys. but Kaours / Rouer gue / 
Ouercy / and Lymoſyn / they wold in no wyſe
delyuer / nor the countie of Ponthyeur / nor of
the coūtie of Guyſnes / more than the englyſſh
men hadde in their handes at the ſame tyme.
Thus theſe lordes contynued a fyftene dayes
and made no concluſyon / but theſe dukes determyned
to ſende worde to the two kynges / 
to gyue them knowledge what they had done.
The frenche dukes rode to Abbeuyle and ſhewed
the kynge all the mater / and howe they
had deſyred their coſins of Englande to write
the hole treatie to the kynge of Englande / and
ſo they ſayd they had promyſed to do. And as
I was enfourmed / on the englyſſhe party the
duke of Gloceſtre was harder to entreat than
the duke of Lancaſtre / and bycauſe the commons
of Englande knewe ſomwhat of his entent
therfore they agreed that he ſhulde be ſent
to this treatye / for they knewe well that nothynge
ſhulde paſſe hym without it were for
the honour of the realme. Thus theſe four dukes
amyably departed eche fro other / and concluded
to mete there agayne the nynth day after.
Thus theſe englyſſhe lordes retourned to
Calays / and the frenche lordes to Boloyne / 
and ſo to Abuyle. That tyme in Abuyle there
was a fayre garden / cloſed with the ryuer of
Somme / whereas often tymes the frenche
kynge paſſed the tyme. He ſayd to his brother
of Orlyaunce and to his counſayle / that his
beynge at Abbeuyle dyd hym moche good in
his helthe. There was there the ſame ſeaſone
with the kynge / the kynge Lyon of Armony / 
newly come thyder out of Grece / and out of

thoſe marches / in to his owne coūtrey he durſt
nat entre / for the turkes had conquered it
                  •
                except
the ſtronge towne of Conych / ſtandynge
on the ſee ſyde / whiche the geno ways helde
and kepte for doute of the turkes / for if the turkes
had gotten that porte / they ſhulde haue
doone moche yuell by the ſee to the cyprians
and to the Rodes / and other boundes of cryſtendome.
The kyng of Armony wolde gladly
haue hadde peace bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / in truſt that all yonge knightes and
ſquyers ſhulde go in to Grece to helpe to conquere
agayne his realme of Armony. Whan
the frenche kynges vncles were come to Abbeuyle / 
the kynge was gladde and made theym
good chere / and demaunded howe they had
ſpedde / and they ſhewed hym all the hole proceſſe / 
and vpon what poynte they departed / 
wherof the kynge was gladde / for he ſhewed
to be glad to haue peace. In lyke maner the englyſſh
dukes whan they came to Calays they
wrote to the kynge of Englande all the poyntes
and artycles of that treatye. And ſhortly
they had agayne a good aunſwere / cōmaundynge
them to procede for a peace / ſayenge the
warre had contynewed longe ynoughe / and
that cryſtendome therby was ſore dōmaged.
Thus at the daye prefyxed / theſe dukes mette
agayne at Balyngham / and with the frenche
lordes came the kynge of Armony / to ſhewe to
the lordes of Englande his buſyneſſe and neceſſyte.
He was well knowen with the duke of
Glouceſtre / for he had ben in Englande whan
the frenche army was ordeyned at Sluſe / to
haue gone in to Englande. The duke of Gloceſtre
the ſame tyme receyued the kynge of Armony
and made hym good chere / at a fayre
place of his in Eſſer / called Plaſſhey. At Balyngham
alſo the Dukes of Englande made
the kynge of Armony good chere / and was
glad to here hym ſpeke. And they aunſwered
hym that gladly they wolde ayde hym / wherof
the kynge was ryght ioyfull. Many thynges
were treated in this parlyament. And all
this ſeaſon the cardynall of Line lay at Abbeuyle / 
who was ſente thyder in legacyon / by
hym that called hym ſelfe pope Clemente / for
maters concernyng the churche. The frenche
dukes at this aſſemble at Balyngham / wolde
haue had certayne artycles compriſed in their
treatie / concernynge the churche / and ſuſteynynge
the opynyons of this pope Clemente / 
Robert of Geneue. But whan the Englyſſhe
dukes harde that / they ſayd to their coſyns of
Fraunce. Coſyns / and ye wyll that we ſhall
fall to any poynte of concluſion / ſpeke no more
of that cardynall / we haue nothyng to do with
hym / his matter is a buſynes without profyte
or effecte / we are determyned vpon a pope to
whom we wyll obey / we wyll here no ſpekyng
agaynſte hym / if the other medle any thynge
with vs we ſhall departe and god hence / and
leaue all togytder. After that tyme there was
no mo wordes of that cardynall / he taried ſtyll
at Abbcuyle. Than theſe lordes proceded in
their treaties / the duke of Lancaſtre was well
enclyned to haue peace. The Frenche kynge
the yere before hadde ſore deſyred hym to be a
good meane to entreate for a peace / and ſo he
promyſed to do. howbeit his brother the duke
of Glouceſtre was hard to agree / for he layde
forthe the frenchemens dyſceytes and colored
wordes that they vſed alwayes in their writynges / 
ſayenge howe the frenche men wolde
alwayes wreſtell with their armes dyſcouered / 
whiche was euer perceyued. On a daye
there came a ſquyer of honour a frenche man / 
called Robert the hermyte to ye duke of Glouceſtre / 
he was one of the frenche kynges priuy
chambre / whether he was ſente to the duke of
Gloceſtre or came on his owne heed / I can nat
tell / but as the duke ſhewed me in Englande
at Plaſſhey / this ſquyer ſayd to him. Syr for
the loue of god be nat agaynſt this treatie of
peace / for ye ſe howe the lordes of Fraunce do
their dyligence to bringe it aboute / ye ſhall do
an almeſſe dede / for the warre hath to longe
endured / and ſythe that bothe kynges are content
to haue peace / all their ſubgiettes ought
to obey therto. Than the duke anſwered hym
as he ſayd. Roberte I am nat agaynſt it / nor
wyll nat be / but ye frenche men amonge you / 
ye haue ſo many coloured wordes / ſo darke
and obſcure to our vnderſtandynge / ſo that
whan ye wyll it is warre / and whan ye lyſt it
is peace / thus haue ye ledde vs vnto this preſente
daye. But if the kynge my ſoueraygne
lorde had beleued me / and ſuche other of his
realme as are boūde to ſerue hym / peace ſhulde
neuer haue been bytwene Englande and
Fraunce / tyll reſtytucyon had ben made to vs
of all that is taken fro vs without cauſe / by
ſubtylte and crafte / as god and all the worlde
knoweth. But ſythe the kynge my ſouerayne

lorde enclyneth to the peace / it is reaſone that
we agree to the ſame. and therfore if we make
a peace acordyng to the deſyres of bothe kynges / 
ſythe we be here aſſembled / let it be well
holden on your ſyde / for it ſhall be well kepte
on our partye. And thus the duke ſhewed me
that this Roberte the Hermyte departed fro
hym / and went to his company. And ſo theſe
lordes contynewed ſtyll their treatie.
            
               I Wyll make no further proceſſe / 
but come to concluſyon. Theſe
foure dukes that were at this aſſemble / 
and had full power a
                  •
               d
auctorite of their kynges to take
a tre
                  ••
               ce / and to make a peace. They dyd ſo in
ſuche wyſe / that generall voyce and 
                  〈◊〉
               
through the towne of Abbeuyle that a
peace was taken vpon certayne artycles bytwene
the two kynges / their alyes and conſyderates.
But I ſir Iohan Froyſſart auctour
of this hyſtory / beynge the ſame tyme in Abbe
               
                  ••
               yle / 
coulde nat lerne the certaynte of the artycles
compriſed in that peace. Howe be it I
knewe that a peace was taken to endure four
yeres / to be kepte ferme and ſtable / bothe by
ſee and by lande. And it was concluded and agreed
that within the ſayde ſpace of the four
yere / ſhulde be delyuered to the kynge of Englande
for euer / and perpetually to all kinges
of Englande and to his cōmyſſioners / all the
landes and ſygnories in the countrey of Languedo
                  •
                /
and to be as of the demayne and herytage
of the crowne of Englande. And this
doone and accomplyſſhed / it was agreed by
the ſame ordynaunce that certayne capitayns
and their men that helde ſome holdes and fortreſſes
in the Realme of Fraunce / ſhulde aduoyde
and departe all ſuche as made warre / 
and do make any warre / vnder the ſhadowe
and coloure of the kyng of Englande and the
Englyſſhe men / of what nacyon ſo euer they
were. To all theſe artycles theſe lordes that
were as than at Balyngham were bounde in
writynges ſygned and ſealed / and the copyes
therof ſent to bothe kynges. Than the dukes
of Lancaſtre and Glouceſtre / ſent an harauld
called Marche / with letters to the Kynge of
Englande / ſhewynge and declarynge all the
hole proceſſe & ordynaunce concluded in their
treatie / vpon the forme of peace. Thus this
haraulde departed with his letters / and rode
to Calys / and paſſed ouer to Deuer / and rode
forthe tyll he came to the kynge / who was at a
manoure of his owne beſyde London. Whan
he came in the kynges preſence he delyuered
his letters. And whan the Kynge had redde
them / he was ryght ioyouſe / and gaue to the
haraulde for his good tydynges bryngynge
great giftes / as the ſame haraulde ſhewed me
after at leyſare / as I rode with hym in to the
Realme of Englande. Theſe foure dukes of
Fraunce and of Englande / were ſtyll at Balyngham / 
and ſoiourned there in fayre tentes
and pauylyons / and well and dylygently peruſed
and examyned the artycles of their treatie / 
and wolde paſſe nor ſeale to none tyll all
darke and obſcure wordes were clerely declared
and made perfyte. Nowe in the ſame ſeaſon
there happed to fall a great lette and trouble
in this matter / wherby all was nyghe at a
poynte to haue been broken and made voyde / 
and it is reaſon I tell you the cauſe / to the entent
that the hyſtory be playne and trewe.
            
               YE haue herde here before how the
frenche kyng had great pleaſure
to lye at Abbeuyle / and alſo to be
nere to here dayly howe ye treatie
wente forwarde at Balyngham.
And whan the four dukes were at a poynt (as
ye haue herde) at the concluſyon of the mater / 
the dukes of Lancaſtre and Glouceſtre ſayd / 
howe that it was the entenſyon of kynge Rycharde
kynge of Englande and his counſayle
that pope Bonyface beynge at Rome (whome
the Romayns / almayns / hungaryons / lumbardes / 
venyſyans / and all the nacyons of the
worlde / chryſtened / helde to one pope / and he
that named hym ſelfe Clement degraded and
condēpned) that they ſhulde deſyre the frenche
kynge to take the ſame way. Whan the dukes
of Berrey and Burgoyne vnderſtode thoſe
wordes / the duke of Burgoyne (to the entent
ſomewhat to pleaſe his coſyns of Englande / 
and to the entente that their treatie of peace
ſhulde nat be hyndred therby) ſayd. Fayre coſyns / 
we deſyre you to haue ſome reſpyte to
take counſayle vpon that mater / whiche was
graunted them. And thervpon they toke counſayle / 
and than aunſwered / and the Duke of
Burgoyne ſpake and ſayd. Fayre coſyns / the

mater and queſtyon of the two popes / is nat
couenable to be moued nor ſpoken of here amonge
vs / and we marueyle why ye put this
mater in cōmunycacion / for at the fyrſt begynnyng
of our treatie / ye refuſed to ſe or to ſpeke
with the Legate de la Lyne / who is as yet in
Abbeuyle / wherfore we reſt vs on that. Whan
the cardynalles at Rome dyd choſe pope Vrbayne / 
and after his dyſceaſe pope Bonyface / 
none of our party nor yet of yours were called
to that electyon / and in lykewyſe we ſaye of
Clement / who is at Auygnon. We ſaye nat agaynſt / 
but that it were great almes to a peaſe
theym / and to vny the churche / who ſo myght
entende to do it / but lette vs leaue that mater / 
and lette the vnyuerſitees and clerkes determyne
it. and whan all our buſyneſſe is concluded / 
and a ferme peace ratifyed / than by the
counſayle of our coſyn the kynge of Almayne / 
we ſhall entende therto gladly on our partye / 
and in lykewyſe do you on your partie. With
this aunſwere the dukes of Englande were
well content / for it ſemed to them reaſonable.
Than they aunſwered and ſayde. Fayre coſyns
ye haue ſayde very well / we are content
with the ſame. Thus that mater reſted. Than
there fell a nother great lette and trouble / for
the frenche kynge who had layne at the towne
of Abuyle a great ſeaſon / bycauſe of the great
diſportes / pleaſure / and paſtyme that he foūde
there / ſodaynly he fell agayne in to his maladye
of franſy / in lyke maner as he had ben the
yere before. He that fyrſt perceyued it was ſyr
Willyam Martell / a knyght of Normandy / 
who was alwayes nere to the kynges perſone
in his priuy chambre. The ſame ſeaſone the
dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne were at Boloyne / 
or at Balyngham / vpon thende of their
parlyament / and they had in a manerall concluded
for that ſeaſone. And as ſoone as the
duke / of Orlyaūce brother to the kynge / knewe
of this chaunce of the kynges ſyckneſſe / and
that he had ſene hym / he ſente a ſecrete ſquyer
of his named Bonyface to his vncles to Boloyne / 
aduertiſynge them ſecretly of the kynges
dyſeaſe. Whanne the dukes knewe that / 
they were ryght ſorye and departed / for they
had all redy taken their leaues of their coſyns
of Englande / who were alſo departed to Calays / 
and taryed there to here tydynges fro
the kyng of Nauerte and fro the duke of Bretaygne / 
for they hadde moued in their treatie
that the caſtell of Chyerbourge / ſtandynge on
the ſeeſyde / vpon the cloſe of Conſtantyne in
Normandy / whiche the kynge of Englande
had in gawge and in kepynge / as I was enfourmed / 
for the ſōme of threſcore thouſande
nobles of Englande / that the frenche kynge
ſhulde paye the ſayd ſomme / and the caſtell to
retourne to the Kynge of Nauerre / and alſo
the ſtronge caſtell of Breſt that the englyſſhe
men helde / ſhulde retourne to the duke of Bretaygne.
The dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
abode nat the concluſyon of that matter / but
came to Abbeuyle / and founde the kynge in
ryght yuell eſtate of his helthe / where of they
were ſory. The kynges ſyckneſſe was kepte
ſecrete as longe as it myght be / but it was nat
very longe / for ſuche aduentures are ſoone
ſpredde abrode. Thus all the lordes that had
been in Abbeuyle departed one after another
euery man home to his owne howſe. Than it
was determyned that the kynge ſhulde be caryed
in an horſe lytter to the caſtell of Crayll
vpon Oyſe / where he had been before. Thyder
he was conueyed by nyght tyme / and the
daye tyme he reſted / for the heate of the ſonne.
The duke of Berrey and the duke of Orlyaunce
rode to Crayell with the kynge / and the
duke of Burgoyne rode in to Arthoys and in
to Flaunders / vyſitynge his countreys / and
founde the ducheſſe his wyfe at the caſtell of
Hedyn. As than there was no mo wordes ſpoken
of the lorde de la Ryuer nor of ſyr Iohan
Mercyer / they were as than all forgoten / no
man ſpake of their greuaunce nor of their delyueraunce.
This ſeconde malady that Charles
the frenche kynge was fallen in / dyd put
away greatly the ſpeakynge of the people. The
wyſe and ſage men of Fraunce feared before
greatly this chaunce / for they ſawe the kynge
was lykely to fall in to that malady / by reaſon
of the great exceſſe that he had vſed in tymes
paſte / and through the febleneſſe of his heed.
mayſter Willm̄ of Harſley was as than newly
deed / and ſuche as were nere about ye kyng
coude nat tell where to haue a good ſure phiſicyon
to wayt vpon ye kyng / howbeit they that
were about him dyd ye beſt they coude deuiſe.
         
         
            ¶Of the dethe of pope Clement at
Auygnon / and of the lectyon of pope
Benedic. Cap. C.xcvi.
            
               
               IN that tyme in the moneth
of Septembre / paſſed
out of this worlde at Auygnon
Roberte of Geneue / 
named pope Clement / and
it came by hym as he had
alwayes ſaid before. whan
any man ſpake of the peace and vny
                  •
               n of the
church / he wolde ſay alwayes / howe he wolde
dye pope / and ſo he dyd / in maner as ye haue
herde here before / wrongfully or ryghtfully I
wyll nat determyne. Than the Cardynalles
there were ſore abaſſhed / and ſtudyed whome
they myght choſe to be pope. The ſame tyme
the Frenche kynge retourned agayne to his
helth / wherof all ſuche as loued him had great
ioye / and ſpecyally the good quene / who had
gyuen moche almeſſe and done many pylgrymages
for the kynge / and cauſed generall proceſſyons
to be made in Parys. As I was enfourmed
ye cardynals at Auygnon dyd electe
and choſe to be pope the cardynall de la Line.
To ſpeke truely this cardynall was an holy
manne and of good lyfe. This electyon was
made condycionally / that if the frenche kynge
and his counſayle were content therwith / or
els nat. Nowe regarde and conſidre the great
ſubiectyon that the churche was in / In that
where the churche ſhulde be free / they ſubmytted
them to be vnder ſuche as ſhulde haue ben
ordred by theym. Thus this cardynall de la
Lyne was choſen pope / and named Benedic.
He gaue generall graces to all clerkes that
wolde come to Auignon. And by the coūſayle
of his bretherne the cardynalles / he wrote of
the creacyon of his papalyte to the Frenche
kynge. But as I was enfourmed the kynge
toke lytell regarde therto / for as than he was
nat determyned whether he ſhulde take hym
for very pope or nat / and ther vpon the kynge
ſent for the greateſt clerkes of the vnyuerſyte
of Paris / to haue their aduyſe and counſayle.
Than mayſter Iohan of Gyg
                  •
               neourte and
mayſter Pyer Placyous (who were in prudence
and lernyng / the greateſt clerkes in Parys
ſayde to the kynge in the name of all the
hole vnyuerſyte / howe that the cyſme of the
churche corrupted the cryſten fayth / and howe
that it myght nat long endure in that eſtate / 
without all cryſtendome ſhulde repent it / and
rynne in great daunger / and ſpecially the prelates
and preeſtes of the churche. They of the
vnyuerſyte were determyned to ſende no rolles
to Auygnon / for any clerkes to haue any
graces of this Pope Benedyc. The frenche
kynge ſawe well their opynyons were reaſonable / 
and wolde haue none of his clerkes enrolled
to ſeke for the popes graces / tyll the mater
were better determyned. Thus that mater
abode ſtyll in that eſtate. Howe be it the duke
of Berrey exalted greatly this pope Benedic / 
and ſent his roll / wherby moche people were
purueyed of graces of this Benedic. The duke
of Burgoyne and the ducheſſe dyſſymuled
the mater with the kinge / and ſo dyd the duke
of Orlyaunce with many other great lordes
of Fraunce. and ſome for fauoure helde them
to this pope Benedyc / who denyed no man
his graces / to the entent that his courte at Auygnon
ſhulde be full / and to haue the more
reputacyon. The duke of Bretaygne folowed
the frenche kynges opinyon / for he was before
tyme ſo abuſed by the enformacyon of his coſyn
the erle of Flaunders / that his herte wolde
neuer enclyne to beleue on Pope Clemente / 
though the clerkes of Bretaygne beleued and
helde hym for pope. So whan any promocyon
was voyde in Fraunce / the kynge promoted
his clerkes / without gyuynge any knowledge
therof to this pope Benedic / wherwith
he and his cardynalles at Auygnon were ſore
abaſſhed / and douted leſte the frenche kynge
wolde reſtrayne ſuche rentes and profytes as
they were wonte to haue of the benefytes gyuen
in the realme of Fraunce. Than they determyned
to ſende a legate in to Fraunce to
ſpeke with the Kynge and his counſayle / to
knowe howe he wolde ordre hym agaynſt the
churche / and to ſhewe hym howe that he that
is choſen pope is vnder this condycyon / that
if he be pleaſed / than he to abyde ſtyll as pope / 
or els they to put hym out of his papalyte / and
the cardynals to entre agayne in to conclaue / 
and choſe one after the kynges pleaſure / At
this tyme was come to Paris and was about
the kynge / the freer mynour a meke man / who
was ſente in to Fraunce by pope Bonyface of
Rome. The frenche kynge herde gladly this
freers prechynge. Than came in to Fraunce
the legate fro Auygnon / who was a great and
a ſubtyle clerke and well langaged. Than the
hole vnyuerſyte counſayled the kynge / and
ſayde howe it were well done that eyther Bonyface
or els Benedyc to be put out of th
                  •
                is

papalyte / and all his cardynalles to be putte
out of their cardynalyties. And in ſtede of
them to be choſyn good clerkes / wyfemen / 
and of good conſcyence / as well of Almayne
and Fraunce / as of other nacyons. And they
to be ſette toguyder by good delyberacyon
and counſayle / without fauour or yuell wyll
to ſette the churche therby at one poynt with
one pope. They ſayde / they ſawe well there
was none other waye to bringe it to a good
concluſyon / bycauſe pride and enuy ſo reygned
in the worlde / that the princes and lordes
eche helde their owne partie. This prepoſycion
that the vnyuerſite hadde made before
the kynge / pleaſed right well the kynge / 
and the dukes of Orlyaunce & of Surgoyne.
And the kyng ſayd he wolde write and ſende
meſſangers to the kynge of Almaygne and
of Bo
                  •
               ſme / and of Hungry: and to the kyng
of Englande. And he thought hym ſelfe ſure
ynough of the kynges of Caſtyle / of Nauer / 
of Aragon / of Cicyle / of Naples / & of Scotlāde / 
that they wolde obey to ſuche a pope as
he and his Realme obeyed vnto. And vpon
this / the frenche kyng ſente his letters & meſſangers
to theſe ſayde kynges. There was
good leyſar in doing of this / bothe in goyng
and cōmyng agayne with anſwere. and in yt
meane tyme there paſſed out of this worlde
at Parys / the noble clerke mayſters Iohan of
Gygencourt / of whoſe dethe the kynge and
the lordes / and ye hole vniuerſyte were right
ſorie / for he laſte nat his felowe behynde him
and he had in his dayes taken great payne
to reforme the churche / and to haue brought
it in to a perfyte vnyte.

            ¶Howe the king of Englande gaue
to the duke of Lancaſtre and to his
heyres for euer the duchy of Acquytayne / 
and howe the kyng prepared
to go in to Irelande / and the duke in
to Acquytayne. Cap. C.xcviii.
            
               YE haue herde here before
in this hyſtorie / howe Trewce
was taken bytwene Englande
and Fraunce / and there adherē
               ces
and alyes / bothe by ſee and
by lande. For all that / yet there were robbers
and pyllers in Languedocke / whiche
were ſtraungers and of farre countreis: As
of Gaſcoyne / of Bierne / and of Almaygne.

And amonge other / ſir Iohan of Grayle baſtarde
(ſonne ſomtyme of the Captall of Beuſes / 
a yonge and an experte knyght) was capitayne
of the ſtronge caſtell of Bouteuyll.
Theſe capitayns of the garyſons in Bigore
and marchynge on the realme of Arragone / 
and on the fronters of Xaynton / and in the
marcheſſe of Rochell / and of the garyſon of
Mortaygne / were ſore diſpleaſed that they
myght natte ouer rynne to countrey / as they
were accuſtomed to do. For they were ſtraitlye
commaunded on payne of greuous punyſſhment / 
to do nothyng that ſhulde ſoūde
to the reproche of the peace.
            IN this ſeaſon it was agreed in Englande / 
conſyderynge that the kynge
was yonge / and that he hadde
peace with all his ennemyes / farre and nere / 
excepte with Irelande. For he claymed that
lande of enherytaūce / and his predeceſſours
before him / and was written kyng and lorde
of Irelande. And kynge Edwarde / graunfather
to kynge Rycharde / made all wayes
warre with the Iryſſhe men. And to the entente
that the yonge knyghtes and ſquyers
of Englande ſhulde enploye them ſelfe in dedes
of armes / and therby to augment and encreaſe
the honour of the realme. It was concluded / 
that kynge Rycharde of Englande
ſhulde make thyder a voyage with puyſſaū
               ce
of menne of warre: And ſo to entre in to
Irelande / and nat to retourne agayne without
they hadde an honourable compoſycion
or concluſyon. The ſame ſeaſon it was concluded / 
that the duke of Lancaſtre who had
greatlye traueyled bothe by See and by lande / 
for the augmentacyon and honour of the
reralme of Englande / ſhulde make another
voyage with fyue hundred menne of armes
and a thouſande archers / and to take ſhyppynge
at Hampton or at Plommouthe / and
ſo to ſayle to Guyane and to Acquitaygne.
And it was the entencyon of kynge Rycharde / 
and by conſent of all his counſayle / that
the duke of Lancaſtre ſhulde haue for euer
to hym and to his heyres / all the countrey of
Acquitayne with the purtenaunces / as kyng
Edwarde his father had / or any other kyngꝭ
or dukes of Acquitayne / before tyme had holden
& optayned: And as kyng Rycharde at yt
tyme had / reſerued always the homage that
he ſhulde do to the kynge of Englande / & to
any kynges to come after. But as for all the
obeyſaūces / rentes / lordſhypes / and reuenewes / 
ſhulde parteygne to the duke of Lā
               caſtre
and to his heyres for euer. Of this the
kyng made to hym a clere graunt / & confyrmed
it vnder his writyng & ſeale. With this
gyfte the duke of Lācaſtre was well cōtent &
good cauſe why. For in that Duchy are landes
and countreis for a great lorde to maynteygne
his eſtate with all. The Charter of
this gyfte was engroſed and dewly examyned / 
and paſte by great delyberacyon / and
good aduyſe of counſayle. Beynge preſent

Prelates and barownes of Englande.
Thanne the duke of Lancaſtre purpoſed to

Capi. C.xcix.
            
               THus (as I haue ſhewed)
great preparacyons was made / 
at the portes and hauyns / where

And in lykewyſe there as the duke of Lancaſtre

ſhulde paſſe to go in to Acquitayne / 
Their voyage was lette / and taryed ye ſpace

            THe ſame ſeaſon that all theſe preparacyons
was made / the Quene named
Anne tooke a ſickeneſſe / wherby
the kynge and all his lordes were ryght
ſore troubled / for ſhe was ſo ſore ſicke / that
ſhe paſſed out of this worlde at the feeſt of
Penthecoſt: the yere of our lorde god a thouſande
thre hundred fourſcore and fourtene / 
of whoſe dethe the kynge and all that loued
her / ladyes and damoſelles were ſore troubled / 
and in great heuyneſſe. She was buryed
at Poules in London / and her obſe
                  •
               es

haue it done ſumptuouſly / with great habū
               daunce
of waxe / tapers / and torches / ſo that
the lyke hadde nat ben ſene before. The kynge
wolde haue it ſo / bycauſe ſhe was the Emperours
doughter of Rome and kyng of Almaygne.
The kynge loued her ſo entierly.
They were maryed yonge / howe be it ſhe
dyed without iſſue. Thus in one ſeaſon / the
kynge / the duke of Lancaſtre / and the erle of
Derby were wydowers. And there was no
ſpekynge of remaryeng / nor the kyng wolde
here no ſpekynge therof. Thus the kynges
voyage in to Irelande was ſomwhat retarded
& let / howe be it the prouiſyon and other
lordes / ſuche as ſhulde go with the kynge / 
paſſed ouer the ſee and landed at Duuelyn / 
whiche was alwayes Englyſſhe / and there
is an archebiſſhoppe who was with the kynge.
And anone after Mydſomer the kynge
departed fro the marcheſſe of London / and
toke the waye throughe Wales huntyng and
ſportynge hym / to forgette the dethe of his
quene / and ſuche as ſhulde go with the kynge
ſette forwarde. Two of the kynges vncles / 
Edmonde duke of yorke and Thomas

great nombre of other knightes and ſquiers
Suche reſerued / as abode behynde to kepe
the marcheſſe agaynſt the ſcottes / who were
ſuche people as neuer kepte no truce nor promyſe.
The lorde Iohan of Hollande erle of
Huntyngton was as than on his waye to Ieruſalem
and to ſaynt Katheryns mount / and
purpoſed to retourne by the realme of Hungry / 
for as he paſſed through Fraūce (where
he hadde great chere of the kyng / and of his
brother and vncles) he herde howe the kyng
of Hungry and the great Turke ſhulde haue
batayle togyder / therfore he thought ſure
lye to be at that iourney. On the otherſyde
the duke of Lancaſtre came to Plomouthe / 
where his ſhippes laye redy. And whan his
men were come and his veſſelles all charged
and had wynde at wyll / they toke ſhippyng
and diſancred and ſayled towardes Burdeaux / 
on the ryuer of Gyron.
            
               NOwe lette vs ſpeke of the kyng

four thouſande men of armes
and thyrtie thouſande archers.
They ſhipped at thre places.
At Brutowe / at Holyheed / and at Herforde / 
they paſſed ouer daylye. And in Irelande
all redy there was a valyaunt knyght
of Englande / called erle of Ormonde. He
helde landes in Irelande / and ſo dyde his
predeceſſours / but it was as than in debate.
The erle Marſhall of Englande hadde the
vowarde with fyftene hundred ſpeares and
two thouſande archers. The kynge of Englande
and his two vncles toke ſhyppinge
at Herforde in Wales. Thus the army paſſed
ouer without dōmage / & than they were
lodged in Irelande / by the apoyntement of
the duke of Glouceſtre cōſtable of Englande
and by the marſhals / all abrode in the countrey / 
beyond ye cytie of Duuelyn a .xxx. myle / 
for the countrey was as than̄e inhabytable:
Howe be it they laye wyſely and ſurely for

they myght haue taken great dōmage. And
the kynge and his vncles were lodged in the
cytie of Duuelyn: and as it was ſhewed me
all the whyle they were there / they were largely
prouyded of vitayls: For the Englyſſhe
men are / ſuche men of warre as can well

forage and take aduaūtage / and make good

               TRewe it was / that I
ſir Iohan Froiſſart (as at
that tyme treaſourer and
chanon of Chymay / in the
erldome of Heynaulte in
the dioceſe of Liege) had
great affectyon to go and
ſe the realme of Englande / whan I had ben
in Abbeuyle / and ſawe that trewce was taken
bytwene the realmes of Englande and
Fraunce / and other countreis to them conioyned
and there adherentes / to endure four
yeres by See and by lande. Many reaſons
moued me to make that voyage. One was / 
bycauſe in my youthe I hadde been brought
vp in the court of the noble kynge Edwarde
the thyrde and of quene Philyppe his wyfe / 
and amonge their chyldren / and other barones
of Englande / that as than were a lyue:
In whome I founde all nobleneſſe / honour / 
largeſſe / and courteſy. Here fore I deſyred
to ſe the countre / thynkynge therby I ſhulde
lyue moche the lengar / for I hadde nat been
there .xxviii. yere before / & I thought though
I ſawe natte thoſe lordes that I lefte a lyue
there / yet at the leeſt I ſhulde ſe their heyres
the whiche ſhulde do me moche good to ſe / 
and alſo to iuſtifye the hyſtories and maters
that I hadde written of them. And or I toke
my iourney / I ſpake with duke Aubert of
Bauyere / and with the Erle of Heynaulte / 
Hollande / zelande / and lorde of Freeſe / and
with my lorde Wyllyam erle of Oſtrenaunt / 
and with my right honourable lady Iahane
ducheſſe of Brabant and of Luſenbourge / 
and with the lorde Eugerant / lorde Coucy / 
and with the gentyll knyght the lorde of Gomegynes / 
who in his youthe and myne / had
been toguyder in Englande in the kynges
courte. In lykewiſe ſo had I ſene there the
lorde of Coucy / and dyuers other nobles of
Fraunce / holden great houſholdes in London / 
whan they laye there in hoſtage for the
redempcion of kynge Iohan / as than Frenche
kynge: As it hath been ſhewed here before
in this hyſtorie.
            THeſe ſayd lordes and the Ducheſſe
of Brabant / counſayled me to take
this iourney / and gaue me letters of
recommendacyon to the kynge of Englande
and to his vncles / ſauynge the lorde Coucy:
He wolde nat write to the kynge bycauſe he
was a Frenche man / therfore he durſte nat / 
but to his doughter / who as than was called
ducheſſe of Irelande. And I had engroſed
in a fayre boke well enlumyned / all the matters
of Amours and moralytees / that in four
and twentie yeres before I hadde made and
compyled / whiche greatly quickened my deſyre
to go in to Englande to ſe kyng Rycharde / 
who was ſonne to the noble prince of Wales
and of Acquitayne / for I hadde nat ſene
this kynge Rycharde / ſythe he was Chriſtened
in the Cathedrall churche of Burdeaux / 
at whiche tyme I was there / and thought to
haue goone with the prince the iourney in to
Galycia in Spaygne. And whan̄e we were
in the cytie of Aſte / the prince ſente me backe
in to Englande to the Quene his mother.
            For theſe cauſes and other / I hadde great
deſyre to go in to Englande to ſe the kynge
and his vncles. Alſo I hadde this ſaid fayre
boke well couered with veluet / garnyſſhed
with clapſes of Syluer and gylte / therof to
make a preſent to the kynge / at my fyrſt cominynge
to his preſence. I hadde ſuche deſyre
to goo this voyage / that the payne and traueyle
greued me nothyng. Thus prouyded
of horſes and other neceſſaries I paſſed the
See at Calais and came to Douer / the .xii.
daye of the moneth of Iuly. Whan̄e I came
there I founde no man of my knowledge / it
was ſo longe ſythe I had been in Englande
and the houſes were all newly chaūged / and
yonge children were become men / and ye women
knewe me natte nor I theym. So I abode
halfe a daye and all a nyght at Douer:
It was on a Tueſdaye / And the nexte daye

by nyne of the clocke I came to Canterbury
to ſaynt Thomas ſhrine / and to the tombe
of the noble prince of Wales / who is there entered
ryght richely. There I herde maſſe &
made myne offrynge to the holy ſaynt / and
thanne dyned at my lodgynge: And there I
was enformed / howe kyng Richarde ſhulde
be there the nexte daye on pylgrimage / whiche
was after his retourne out of Irelande / 
where he had ben the ſpace of nyne moneches
or there about. The kyng hadde a deuocyon
to viſyte ſaynt Thomas ſhrine / and alſo bycauſe
the prince his father was there buryed
Than I thought to abyde the kynge there / 
and ſo I dyde. And the next daye the kynge
came thyder with a noble company of lordes
ladyes / and damoſelles. And whan I was among
them they ſemed to me all newe folkes
I knewe no ꝑſone. The tyme was ſore chaū
               ged
in .xxviii. yere. And with the kynge as
than was none of his vncles / the duke of Lā
               caſtre
was in Acquitayne / and the dukes of
yorke and Gloceſtre were in other buſyneſſes / 
ſo that I was at the firſte all abaſſhed / 
for if I had ſene any auncyent knyght that
had ben with kyng Edwarde or with the price / 
I had ben well reconforted and wolde haue
gone to hym / but I coulde ſe none ſuche.
Than̄e I demaunded for a knyght called ſir
Rycharde Seury / whyder he were a lyue or
nat / and it was ſhewed me yes / but he was
at London. Than I thought to go to ye lorde
Thom̄s Percy / great ſeneſchall of Englade
who was there with the kyng. ſo I acquaynted
me with hym and I founde hym right honorable
and gracyous. And he offred to preſent
me and my letters to the kynge / wherof
I was right ioyfull / for it behoued me to haue
ſome meanes to bringe me to the preſence
of ſuche a prince as the Kynge of Englande
was. He wente to the kynges Chambre / at
whiche tyme the kynge was gone to ſlepe / 
and ſo he ſhewed me / and badde me retourne
to my lodgynge and come agayne / and ſo I
dyde. And whan I came to the byſſhoppes
palays / I founde the lorde Thomas Percy
redy to ryde to Oſpring. And he counſayled
me to make as than no knowledge of my beynge
there / but to folowe the court / and ſayd
he wolde cauſe me euer to be well lodged / tyl
the kyng ſhulde be at the fayre caſtell of Ledes
in Kent. I ordered me after his coūſayle
and rode before to Oſpring / & by aduēture I
was lodged in an houſe / where was lodged
a gentyll knyght of Englande called ſir Wyllyam
Lyſle. He was taryed there behynde
the kynge / bycauſe he had payne in his heed
all the nyght before. He was one of the kynges
preuy chambre. And whan he ſawe that
I was a ſtraunger / and as he thought of the
marcheſſe of Fraūce bycauſe of my langage / 
We fyll in acquayncaunce toguyder / for gentylmen
of Englande are curceſſe / treatable / 
and gladde of acquayntaunce. Than he demaunded
what I was / and what buſyneſſe
I had to do in thoſe parties. I ſhewed hym
a great parte of my cōmynge thyder / and all
that the lorde Thomas Percy hadde ſayd to
me / and ordred me to do. He than anſwered
and ſayde / howe I coulde nat haue a better
meane / and that on ye Friday ye kyng ſhulde
be at the caſtell of Ledes. And he ſhewed me
that whan I came there / I ſhuld fynde there
the duke of yorke the kynges vncle / wherof
I was ryght gladde / bycauſe I had letters
dyrected to hym / and alſo that in his youthe
he hadde ſene me / in the courte of the noble
kyng Edwarde his father and with ye quene
his mother. Than on the Friday in the mornyng
ſir Wylliam Lyſle and I rode toguyder / 
and on the waye I demaunded of hym / 
if he had been with the kynge in the voyage
in to Irelande. He anſwered me yes. Than
I demaunded of hym the maner of the Hole
that is in Irelande / called ſaynt Patrykes
purgatorie / if it were trewe that was ſayde
of it or nat. Than he ſayde / that of a ſuretie
ſuche a hole there was / and that he hym ſelfe
and another knyght of Englande hadde ben
there whyle the kynge laye at Duuelyn / and
ſayd / howe they entred in to the hoole & were
cloſed in at the ſonne goynge downe / and abode
there all nyght / and the nexte mornyng
iſſued out agayne at the ſon riſyng. Than I
demaūded it he had any ſuche ſtrāge ſightes
or vyſions as was ſpoken of. Than he ſayd / 
howe that whan he & his felowe were entred
and paſt the gate yt was called ye purgatorie
of ſaynt Patryke / and that they were diſcended
and gone downe thre or four paces / diſcendyng
downe as in to a cellar / a certayne
hoote wapure roſe agaynſt them / and ſtrake
ſo in to their heedes / that they were fayne to
ſyt downe on the ſteres / whiche are of ſtone.

And after they had ſytte there a ſeaſon / they
had great deſyre to ſlepe / and ſo fell a ſlepe
and ſlepte there all nyght. Than I demaū
               ded
that if in their ſlepe they knewe where
they were / or what viſyons they had: he anſwered
me / that in ſlepyng they entred in to
great ymaginacyōs and in marueylous dremes / 
otherwyſe / than they were wont to haue
in their Chambres: and in the mornynge
they iſſued out / and within a ſhorte ſeaſon / 
clene forgate their dreures & viſyons / wherfore
he ſayde / he thought all that mater was
but a fantaſy. Than I lefte ſpekyng any further
of that matter / bycauſe I wolde fayne
haue knowen of hym what was done in the
voyage in Irelande. And I thought as thā
to haue demaūded what the kyng had done
in that iourney / but than company of other
knyghtes came and fell in communycacion
with hym / ſo that I lefte my purpoſe for that
tyme. Thus we robe to Ledes / and thyder
came the kyng and all his cōpany / and there
I founde the lorde Edmonde duke of yorke.
Than I went to hym and delyuered my letters
fro the erle of Heynaulte his coſyn / and
fro the erle of Oſtrenaunt. The duke knewe
me well and made me good chere and ſayde.
Sir Iohan / holde you alwayes nere to vs / 
and we ſhall ſhewe you loue and courteſy / 
we are boūde therto for the loue of tyme paſt
and for loue of my lady the olde Quene my
mother / in whoſe courte ye were: we haue
good remembraunce therof. Than I thanked
hym as reaſon requyred. So I was aduaunſed
by reaſon of hym and ſir Thomas
Percy and ſir William Lyſle. By their meanes
I was brought in to the kynges chambre / 
and in to his preſence by meanes of his
vncle the duke of yorke. Than I delyuered
my letters to the kyng / and he toke and reed
thē at good leyſar. Than he ſayd to me that
I was welcome / as he that hadde ben and is
of the Englyſſhe courte. As on that daye I
ſhewed nat the kynge the boke that I hadde
brought for hym / he was ſo ſore occupyed wt
great affayres / that I had as than no leyſar
to preſent my boke. The kyng was ſore buſyed
there in counſayle for two great & mightye
maters. Firſt was / in determynynge to
ſende ſufficient meſſangers / as therle of Rutlande
his coſyn germayne and the erle Marſhall /

Charles the Frenche kynge / to treate with
hym for a maryage to be hadde / bytwene the

of Pyntherne / the lorde of Newcaſtell / the
lorde of Neſque / the lorde of Copane / and
the counſaylours of Burdeux / Bayon / and

quickely purſued their mater / ſythe the kynges

of the requeſtes and proceſſe that they
had put forthe to the kyng / on the gyfte that
the kynge had gyuen to his vncle the duke of
Lācaſtre / of the landes / ſeignories / lordſhippes / 
and baronyes in Acquytayne / whiche
they verifyed to pertaygne to the kynge and
realme of Englande. They hadde alleged to
the kynge and his counſayle / that his gyfte
myght nat paſſe ſo / bycauſe it was vnprofytable
and mutyle. For they ſayd / all thoſe landes
helde of right and of the demayne of the

they wolde nat diſioyne nor diſceuer thē fro

had ſente for the mooſt parte of the prelates
and lordes of Englande / to be at the feeſt of
Maudelyntyde / at a manner of the kynges
called Eltham / a ſeuyn Englyſſhe myles fro

a four dayes / the kyng retourned to Rocheſter
and ſo to Elthame: & ſo I rode forthe

               IN rydynge the waye
bytwene Leades and Eltham / 
I demaunded of ſyr
Willyam Lyſle and of ſyr
Iohn̄ of Graily capitayne
of Bouteuyll / ye cauſe why
the king drewe to London
warde / and why that great counſayle ſhulde
aſſemble at Eltham. They tolde me / and ſpecially
ſyr Iohan Graily reherſed to me playnly / 
why ye lordes of Gaſcon were come thyder / 
and the counſaylours of the good townes and
cyties. thus I was enfourmed by this knight
who knewe the trouth / for he was often tymes
amonge theym / they and he were in a maner
all of one countrey and fronter / he ſayde thus.
Surely whan the Duke of Lancaſtre came
fyrſt in to Acquytayne / ſuffycyently fournyſſhed
with charters and wrytinges engroſed
and ſealed with the great ſeale of Englande / 
and enrolled and fermely decreed with full accorde
of all prelates and lordes of Englande / 
and alſo by conſente of the duke Edmonde of
yorke and Erle of Cambridge / and of Thomas
duke of Glouceſtre / though the ſayd herytages
might by ſucceſſion haue come to them / 
for Kynge Rycharde of Englande their nephue / 
had as than no chyldren / and theſe ſayd
two dukes were brethern germayns of father
and mother to the duke of Lancaſtre / whiche
duke anone after he was come in to Acquytayne / 
ſente ſome of his counſayle to the cytie
of Burdeaux / to ſhewe to the Mayre & counſaylours
of the towne / the fourme and tenoure
of his requeſt / and for what cauſe he was come
in to the countrey. Whan they herde this they
greatly marueyled / howe be it they ioyfully receyued
the kynges and dukes cōmyſſioners / 
for the honoure of the kynge / to whome they
ought their ſeruyce and obeyſaunce. Than
they deſyred to take coūſayle / and ſo they dyd.
Than after they aunſwered and ſaid / that the
duke of Lancaſtre ſonne to kynge Edwarde / 
who had ben their lorde was welcome amōge
them / and none otherwyſe. for they ſayde they
had nat ſo farre forthe taken counſayle / as to
receyue hym to their ſouerayne lorde / for they
ſayd that to kyng Rycharde their ſoueraygne
lorde they had done feaultie and homage / and
as than he had made them no quytāce. Than
aunſwered the cōmyſſioners and ſayd. Syrs
feare nat but that ye ſhall haue ſuffycient dyſcharge
in that behalfe / ſo ye take the duke to
your ſouerayne lorde / for ye ſhall ſe by the content
of the kinges charters / that there ſhall neuer
queſtyon be made therof in tyme to come.
Whan̄e they of Burdeaux ſawe they were ſo
nere touched / they founde theym another ſocoure
and ſayd. Fayre lordes / your cōmyſſion
extendeth nat all onely vpon vs / but in lykewyſe
to them of the cytie of Bayon / and to the
prelates and barones of Gaſcoyne / and to all
that be vnder the obeyſaunce of the kynge of
Englande. ye ſhall drawe you towardes them
and as they do and ordre thē / we ſhall folowe
the ſame. Other aunſwere the cōmyſſioners
coulde nat haue at that tyme of them of Burdeau
                  •
               .
Than they departed and rode to Lyborne / 
where the duke of Lancaſtre laye.
            WHan the duke herde their aunſwers / 
he imagyned in hymſelfe / that the 
                  ••
               
               ſyneſſe
that he was come thyder for / 
ſhulde nat be ſo ſone atcheued as he truſted it
ſhulde haue ben. Than he ſent his coūſayle to
the cytie of Bayon / and as they ſped in Burdeaux
ſo they dyd there / other anſwere coude
they haue none. And fynally all the prelates
and noble men / counſaylours of cytes & good
townes in Gaſcoyne / vnder the obeyſaunce of
the kyng of Englande / conioyned them togyder / 
and concluded in the forme and manner
as I ſhall ſhewe you. They ſayde they wolde
gladly receyue ye duke of Lancaſtre in to their
cyt
                  •
               es / townes / and caſtelles / as the ſonne of
kyng Edwarde / and vncle to kinge Rycharde
of Englāde / ſo that at his entringes he ſhulde
ſolemply ſwere / that peſably and in good maner
he and his ſhulde entreat the people with
out enforſynge of any thynge / and to pay reaſonably
for euery thynge that they ſhulde diſpende / 
and alſo to ſwere that he ſhulde nat oppreſſe
nor cauſe to be oppreſſed the iuryſdictyon
of the Crowne of Englande / by no maner
of waye nor accyon. The duke aunſwered to
this and ſayd / that he was nat come in to the
countrey to greue or oppreſſe the people / but
wolde rather kepe and defende them agaynſt
all men / as his herytage / and deſyred and requyred
theym / that the cōmaundement of the
kynge of Englande myght be obſerued and
acompliſſhed. Than the hole countrey by a comune
voyce / ſayd yt in no wyſe they wolde departe
fro the crowne of Englande / and that it

was nat in the kynge of Englandes power to
gyue them away to another lorde / nor to put
them fro the crowne of Englande. Theſe demaundes
and denyenges were longe a debatyng / 
bytwene the duke of Lancaſtre and the
lordes and townes of Gaſcon. And whan the
duke ſawe none other remedy / than he made
requeſt to the countrey that the prelates and
noble men / and coūſaylours of the good townes
ſhulde ſende ſuffycient perſonages to the
kynge of Englande and to his counſayle / and
howe he wolde ſende in lykewyſe notable perſones
of his counſayle. and loke what ſo euer
the kyng and his counſayle ſhulde determyne
in that cauſe / he promyſed ſurely to abyde ther
by / whether it were with hym or agaynſt him.
Than they of Gaſcon conſydred well that his
requeſt was reaſonable / and agreed to do as
the duke had deſyred. Than the duke rode to
Burdeaur / and was lodged in the abbey of
ſaint Andrewes / where he had ben lodged before
tyme. Than they of the cytie of Bayon
and Dar / apoynted ſuffycient perſonages to
ſende in to Englande and the barons of Gaſcon
vnder the kinges obeyſaunce / ſent in lyke
wyſe. Alſo ye ſhall knowe that whan ye frenche
kyng and his vncles vnderſtode that the duke
of Laucaſtre was peaſably entred in to the cytie
of Burdeaux / and knewe nat for what entent / 
nor whether he wolde kepe or breake the
trewce. Than he and his counſayle determyned
to ſende to hym / to knowe ſomwhat of his
entent. There was apoynted to go / the lorde
Boucyquant marſhall of Fraunce / the lorde
Iohan of caſtell Morante / and Iohan Barres
of Barroys / and they to haue with them a
thouſande ſpeares. Thus they rode forth tyll
they came to the cytie of Agen / and there taryed.
Than they ſent harauldes and meſſnagers
to Burdeaux to the duke of Lancaſtre / 
ſhewynge hym howe they wolde gladly ſpeke
with hym. The duke made theſe meſſangers
good chere / and wrote agayne to theſe lordes / 
certifyeng them / that where as they had great
deſyre to ſpeke with hym / in lykewyſe he had
the ſame to ſpeke with them / and bycauſe they
ſhulde take ye leſſe payne he promyſed to come
and mete with them at Bergerate. And whan
the frenche lordes ſawe this letter / they gaue
credence therto and ordred them there after / 
and as ſone as they knewe that the duke was
come to Bergerate / they departed fro Agen
and rode thyder. There they were receyued
and lodged in the towne / and their company
in the ſubbarbes. Theſe lordes ſpake with the
Duke and ſhewed hym their meſſage. The
duke receyued them ſwetely / and aunſwered
and ſayd / howe he wolde be a good & a kynde
neyghbour to the frenche kyng and the realme
and to kepe and mayntayne the trewce taken
bytwene the two kynges / for he ſayde he hym
ſelfe was one of the princypalles that ayded to
make and ordayn that truce / wherfore he ſayd
he ought nat nor wold nat breke it / therof they
myght be well aſſured. The dukes aunſwere
pleaſed greatly the lordes of Fraunce. Thus
the duke and they were louingly togyder / and
the duke gaue them a great dyner and ſupper / 
and after they tooke their leaue / and the duke
retourned to Burdeaux and the frenche men
in to Fraunce. They founde in their waye the
duke of Berrey at the cytie of Poyeters / and
they ſhewed hym what they had doone. The
duke of Berrey thought the duke of Lancaſters
anſwere reaſonable / and ſo dyd ye frenche
kynge and the duke of Burgoyne / and ſo the
mater abode ſtyll in this eſtate. And for this
cauſe quod ſir Iohan Graily the duke of Lancaſtre
hath ſent hyther in to Englande of his
counſayle / as ſyr Wylliam Pe
                  •
               reer and ſyr
Peter Clyfton / and two clerkes lerned in the
lawe / as mayſter Iohan Huche and mayſter
Iohan Rychard of Leycettour / to treate and
to pleate his maters before the kynge and his
vncles / and for this cauſe the kynge rydeth to
Eltham / and ſhall be there on thurſday nexte / 
that ſhall be Mary maudelyn daye / but what
ſhalbe done as yet I knowe nat. But as I am
enfourmed of ſome englyſſhe men that knowe
ſomwhat / the duke of Glouceſtre wyll be princypally
of the opynion yt his brother the duke
of Lancaſtre ſhulde abyde ſtyll in Guyen / rather
than to retourue agayne in to Englande / 
bycauſe he was ſo great with the kynge. for I
enſure you this duke of Glouceſtre is a maruaylous
mynded man / proude and preſumptuous / 
he wolde rule all hym ſelfe / and he is ſo
beloued of the comynalte / that what ſo euer he
ſaythe they wyll enclyne to him. He cauſed the
valyaunte knyght the lorde Symon Burle
and the duke of Irelande / the archebyſſhoppe
of yorke and many other knyghtes / and other
of the kynges counſayle to dye for hatred and
yuell wyll / durynge the ſeaſone that the duke

of Lancaſtre was beyonde the ſee in Caſtyle.
He is more dred in Englande than beloued.
            NOwe lette this mater paſſe quod ſyr
Iohn̄ Graily / and I ſhall ſhewe you
nowe the ſeconde buſyneſſe that the
kynge hathe to do / as I am enfourmed. The
kynges pleaſure is to be remaryed / and hath
ſertched ouer all for a wyfe. if the duke of Burgoyne
or the erle of Haynalte had any doughter
to mary / the kynge wolde gladly haue had
one of them / but they haue none / but ſuche as
be maryed. It hath ben ſhewed the kyng that
the kynge of Nauarre hath bothe ſuffers and
doughters / but he wyll nat entende yt wayes.
The duke of Glouceſtre hath a doughter able
to mary he wolde gladly that the kyng ſhulde
haue had her / but the kynge wolde nat / for he
ſaid ſhe was to nere of his kynne / for ſhe is his
coſyn germayne. The kynge enclyneth moſte
his mynde to the Frenche kynges doughter / 
wherof all the countrey hath great marueyle
that he wolde take his enemyes doughter. the
kynge is nat the beſte beloued Prince of the
worlde with his people / but he ſetteth lytell
therby. he ſheweth always how he had rather
haue warre with any other realme than with
Fraūce / wherfore he wolde haue a good peace
bytwene the frenche kynge and hym and their
realmes / for the kynge wyll often tymes ſaye
that the warre hath endured to longe bytwene
them / and that many valyaunt men are deed
therby on bothe parties / wherby the chriſten
faythe is ſore mynyſſhed and febled. And it is
nat pleaſaunt to the realme of Englande that
he ſhulde mary with Fraunce / and it hath ben
ſhewed hym that the doughter of Fraunce is
ouer yonge / and that this fyue or ſyxe yere ſhe
ſhall nat be able to kepe hym company. Therto
he hath aunſwered and ſaythe / that ſhe ſhall
growe ryght well in age / and though he faſte
a ſeaſon he ſhall take it well a worth / and ſhall
ordre her in the meane ſeaſon at his pleaſure / 
and after the maner of Englande / ſayenge alſo
howe he is yet yonge ynough to abyde tyll
the lady be of age. No man canne breke the
kynge out of this purpoſe / and or ye departe / 
ye ſhall here moche of this matter. And thus
for theſe cauſes the kynge rydeth nowe to Eltham.
            THus this gentle knyght ſyr Iohan of
Graily and I deuyſed togyther as we
rode bytwene Rocheſtre and Dertforde. this
knight was capytayn of Bouteuyle / baſtarde
ſonne ſomtyme to the Captall of Beuſz / and
I herde his wordes gladly and dyd put them
in memory. And all the way bytwene Leades
and Eltham I rode moſt parte in his company / 
and with ſyr Wylliam Lyſle. Thus the
kynge came to Eltham on a tueſday / and on
the wednyſday the lordes of all coſtes began
to aſſemble. Thyder came the duke of Glouceſtre / 
and the erles of Derby / Arundell / Northumberlande / 
Kent / Rutlande / and the erle
Marſhall / and the archebyſſhoppes of Caunterbury
and yorke / and the byſſhoppes of London
and Wyncheſter. And on the thurſday aboute
the houre of thre / they aſſembled togyther
in the kynges chambre in the kynges preſence.
Than the knyghtes of Gaſcoyne were
ſent for / and the coūſaylours of the good townes / 
And alſo the Duke of Lancaſtres counſayle
was ſent for. I was nat preſēt nor might
nat be ſuffred / there were none but the lordes
of the counſayle / who debated the mater more
than four houres. And after dyner I fell in acquayntaūce
with an auncyent knyght whome
I knewe in kynge Edwardes dayes / and he
was as than of kynge Rychardes priuy counſayle / 
he was called ſyr Rycharde Sury he
knewe me anone / and yet in .xxiiii. yeres he
had nat ſene me before / whiche was at Colbridge / 
and at Bruſelles / in the houſe of duke
Wyncelante of Brabant / and of the ducheſſe
Iahan of Brabant. this knyght ſir Rycharde
Sury made me good chere / and demaunded
of me many thynges / and I aunſwered hym
as I knewe. And as I walked vp and downe
with hym in a galery before the kynges chambre / 
I demaūded hym queſtyons of that counſayle / 
and deſyred hym to tell me if he myght
what concluſion was taken. He herde me well
and pauſed a lytell / and afterwarde ſayd. ſyr
Iohan I ſhall ſhewe you / for it is no mater to
be hydden and kept ſecrete / for ſhortly ye ſhall
here theym publyſſhed all openly. ye knowe
well quod he / and Iame ſure ye haue herde
reherſed howe the duke of Lancaſtre is gone
in to Acquytayne / to reioyce the gyft
                  •
                that the
kynge my ſoueraygne lorde hath gyuen hym / 
for the loue that he hathe to hym / for he hath
doone the kynge ryght good ſeruyce and the

crowne of Englande / therfore in rewarde the
kynge hathe clerely gyuen to hym and to his
heyres for euer / the hole duchy of Acquitayne / 
ſo as it e
                  •
               tendeth in metes and lymytacyons / 
ſeneſchalles / baylyages / ſygnories / and waſſelages / 
and clene quyteth all them that holde
of hym by faythe or othe / and in all homage
the reſorte reſerued / more the kynge hath reſerued
to the crowne of Englande in tyme to
come. And this gyfte is ſo ſufficyently confermed
that all the kynges other vncles and all
the counſayle of Englande hath acorded ther
to / and the kynge hathe gyuen ſpecyall commaundement
to all his ſubgiettes in the ſayd
lymytacyons of Acquytayne / to obey in all
poyntes without any othermeane / his dere
and well beloued vncle / duke Iohan of Lancaſtre / 
and after ye ſyght of his letters to holde
and to take hym to their ſouerayne lorde / and
to ſwere to hym faythe and homage / and to
holde of hym truely / as they haue auncyently
done and helde at the date of thoſe letters / gyuen
by the kyng of Englande or his deputies
or cōmyſſioners. And who ſoeuer that rebelleth
or ſpeketh agaynſt this the kynges graūt
of what condycyon ſo euer he be / to aunſwere
therto within thre dayes. The kynge gaue to
his vncle of Lancaſtre and to his commyſſioners / 
full power and puyſſaunce to correcte
them / and to put them out of all hope to haue
any other retourne or reſorte. yet nat withſtandynge
all theſe letters and ſtrayte cōmaundement
of the kynge / the good townes and cyties
of Gaſcoyne / vnder the kynge of Englandes
obeyſaūce / and all other lordes / knyghtes
and gentlemen of the countrey / are conioyned
togyther to kepe their townes cloſe agaynſte
the duke / and wyll nat nor are nat in mynde
to obey the duke in this caſe / for they ſay / and
haue ſayd / and yet ſuſteyne at this houre / that
the gyfte that the kynge hath gyuen to his vncle
of Lancaſtre / is nat ſuffycient nor profytable / 
and out of the ordre of reaſon. And yt duke
who wolde nat wynne theym but by gentylneſſe / 
herde pacyently their defences. and that
no further inconuenyentes ſhulde enſue / therfore
his counſayle and their counſayles are
come hyther to debate and to declare the cauſe
why they do nat obey the kynges cōmaundement.
And ſurely as this day they haue right
wyſely ſhewed their anſwere / and layde forth
certayne artycles of reaſon / and they haue ben
well herde. And they haue layde ſuche reaſons
that in a maner the kynge and his counſayle
thynke they haue cauſe to abyde by their quarell / 
I ſhall ſhewe you howe / but I wolde ye
kept it ſecrete tyll it be knowen further abrod.
And I aunſwered I wolde ſo do. Well quod
the knyght / one (as me thought was offyciall
of Burdeaux) ſpake for all his partie / and firſt
ſhewed forthe his procutacyon and auctorite / 
to the entent he myght the better be beleued / 
and than beganne and ſayde / that the cytie of
Burdeaux / and the cyties of Bayon and Dax
and all the ſygnories and lorſhyppes that be
appendaunt to the lymyttes of the ſayd countreys
and cyties / are of ſo noble condycyon / 
that no kyng of Englande by no maner of accyon
or dede may put awaye or dyſceuer them
fro the demayns of the crowne of Englande / 
nor to gyue or alyenate them / to chylde / vncle / 
nor brother / by reaſone of maryage or otherwiſe / 
and to veryfie this we ſay that the aboue
named townes / cyties / and ſygnories are ſuffyciently
priueleged by kynges of Englande / 
who haue ſworne faythfully to holde and to
kepe vs ſo / without reuocaſyon. For as ſoone
as any Kynge of Englande entreth in to the
poſſeſſyon of the herytage of the Crowne of
Englande / he ſwereth ſufficiently on the euangelyſtes
to holde this ferme and ſtable without
breakynge. and ye ryght dere ſyr as kyng
of Englande haue made lyke othe. And ſyr to
veryfie this to be of trouth / beholde here theſe
writynges. And ther with he ſhewed forth letters
and charters vnder the ſygnes of notaryes
imperyalles / and ſealed with the great
ſeale of Englande / gyuen by the ſame kynge
Rycharde there beynge preſent / and there openly
he redde it frome clauſe to clauſe. The
charter was well herde and vnderſtande / for
it was bothe in laten and in Frenche / and it
named in the ende many wytneſſes of prelates
and great lordes of Englande / who were
for the more ſuretie teſtes of that dede / at the
leſte to the nombre of .xi. Whanne the kynges
counſayle herde this / they behelde eche other / 
and loked on the kynge. There was no man
ſpake a worde nor made no replycacion. whan
he had redde it ouer he folded it and put it vp / 
and ſpake further / addreſſynge his wordes to
the kynge / and ſayde. Ryght dere ſyr and redouted
ſoueraygne lorde / and you my ryght
dere lordes / and other / at my departynge out

of the countrey / I was charged to ſhewe you
by the counſaylours of the good Cyties and
townes of Gaſcoyne / beynge vnder the obeyſaunce
of the crowne of Englande / hath well
ouer ſene the fourme and maner of your commaūdement / 
ſent vnto them vnder your ſeale / 
whiche they knewe right well / yet they thinke
and ſay that this cōmaundement may nat be
obeyed / for if ſo were that the cyties and good
townes of Guyen wolde enclyne to receyue
the duke of Lancaſtre to their lorde / and acquyte
for euer the homage and obeyſaunce
that they owe to you / it ſhulde be greatly to
the preiudyce of the crowne of Englande / for
thoughe it were ſo that at this tyme preſente
the duke of Lancaſtre is the kynges vncle and
ſubgiet / and well beloued / and wolde holde
and kepe all poyntes and artycles belongyng
to the crowne of Englande / yet it maye ſo hap
that ſuche loue and tenure may lyghtly be loſt / 
by chaunge of heyres / by reaſon of maryages
that are made bytwene lordes and ladyes / in
chaungynge fro one to another / though they
be nere of lygnage / by dyſpenſacyon of the
pope / for ſometyme it is of neceſſyte that maryages
be made of hyghe Princes or of their
chyldren / one with another / to holde their landes
and ſygnories in loue and amyte. And ſo
it myght fall that ſuche heyres as myght dyſcende
of the Duke of Lancaſtre / ſhulde conioyne
theym by maryage to the chyldren of
ſome kynge in Fraunce / or of dukes of Berrey / 
Bretaygne / or erles of Foize / or Armynake / 
or kynges of Nauarre / or dukes of Aniou
or of Mayne / and than they beynge beyonde
the ſee peraduenture in the parties of
Fraunce / ſhulde clayme their enherytaunce / 
and therby put the countrey of Guyen in dyſcorde / 
and to bring it to be againſt the crowne
of Englande / wherby the kynge of Englande
than reygnynge / and the Realme alſo / ſhulde
haue peraduenture ouer moche payne to recouer
it agayne / and ſo the ryght to be put farre
of fro thence whervnto it ſhulde retourne and
be / as of the demayne of the Crowne of Englande.
Wherfore ryght dere ſyr and redouted
lordes and noble counſaylours / pleaſe it
you to conſydre all theſe poyntes and artycles
which I haue purpoſed in your preſence / and
determyne it as ye ſhall ſeme beſt / for ſyr the
full opynion of all the countrey is / they ſaye
they wyll abyde ſtyll in the obey ſaunce of you
ryght redouted lorde and kynge / and in the
demayne of the noble Crowne of Englande.
Therwith this offyciall helde his peace / and
the prelates and lordes eche of them regarded
other. Than they drewe togyther and aproched
to the kynge fyrſte his two vncles / and
the erles of Derby and Arundell. Than they
of Acquytayne were cōmaunded to departe
tyll they were called agayne. They departed
and alſo the two knightes that were come thyder
fro the duke of Lancaſtre. Than the kyng
demaunded counſayle what ſhulde be done / 
and what aunſwere ſhulde be made. The prelates
tourned the aunſwere to the kynges vncles / 
bycauſe the mater touched them rather
than any other. At the fyrſt they excuſed them
ſayeng they myght nat well aunſwere / for the
mater was cōmune / and ought to be debated
by cōmune counſayle / and nat by lygnage nor
fauour. Thus they bode a good ſpace / but fynally
the aunſwere was layde on the duke of
Glouceſtre / and he was prayed and requyred
to ſaye his aduyſe. Than he aunſwered and
ſayde / howe it was a herde thynge to take a
way or to dyſanull the gyfte of a kynge / confermed
and ſealed by the acorde of all his ſubgiettes / 
and by delyberacyon of his ſpecyall
counſayle / wherfore he ſayde his ſubgiettes
ſhuld be rebell that wolde nat obey / for in that
they wolde make that the kynge ſhulde nat be
lorde of his owne enheritaunce / if yt he myght
nat do with his owne what it pleaſed hym.
ſome gloſed thoſe wordes / and ſome though
                  •
               
in their corage / that the aunſwere was nat reaſonable / 
but they durſte nat ſaye agaynſt it / 
the duke of Glouceſtre was ſo ſore dred / and
the erle of Derby ſonne to the duke of Lancaſtre
was there preſente / who furthered thoſe
wordes and ſayde. Fayre vncle ye haue well
ſayd / I am of your opinyon. Therwith the
counſayle began to breke / and ſome murmured
one with another / and they of Guyen nor
yet the duke of Lancaſters knightes were nat
called agayne at that tyme. Whan the kynge
ſawe all the mater he dyſſimuled a lytell / and
it was his entenſyon that they ſhulde aſſemble
togyther agayne in counſayle after dyner / 
to ſe if any other propre way myght be taken
for the honoure of the crowne of Englande.
Than the kynge cauſed the byſſhop of Caunterbury
to ſpeke of that he had gyuen hym in
charge in the mornynge to ſpeke of / that was

vpon the ſtate of his maryage / and to ſende in
to Fraunce. The lordes were of accorde and
named them that ſhulde go / whiche were the
archebyſſhoppe of Duuelyn / the erle of Rutlande / 
the Erle Marſhall / the lorde Beaumonde / 
the lorde Hughe Spenſer / the lorde
Loys Clyfforde / and twenty knyghtes and
xl. ſquyers. Theſe were ſent in to Fraunce to
treat for the maryage of the frenche kynges
doughter Iſabell / of eyght yere of age / and
yet ſhe was all redy promyſed to the duke of
Bretayns ſonne / by a treatie yt was made in
Towrs in Thourayne. Nowe beholde howe
this myght be broken / for the Frenche kynge
and his vncles hadde ſealed with the duke of
Bretayne / yet for all that thenglyſſhe ambaſſadours
had their charge gyuen vnto them / 
and ſo they departed out of Englande and aryued
at Calays / & there taryed a fyue dayes / 
and than departed in great araye / and tooke
the waye to Amyence / and they ſente before
Marche the haraulde / who had brought to
them ſaueconducte goynge and comyng / and
beſyde that the lorde Moncheuerell was ſette
to be their guyde / and to ſe them ſerued of all
thynges neceſſary. ¶Nowe we ſhall leaue to
ſpeke of them and retourne to our fyrſte purpoſe.
            NOwe as I haue ſhewed you before / 
the counſaylours of the Cyties and
good townes of Acquytayne / prayed
the kynge and his counſayle / to whome they
were boude / to mayntayn their lyberties and
fraunches / as in the demayne of the Crowne
of Englande / as he was ſworne to do / affermynge
that ſurely they wolde kepe their auncyente
lyberties / and wyll nat breke it for no
maner of cauſe or condycion / and in holdynge
thus their opynyon / foure partes of the counſayle
and the cōmune voyce of the countrey / reputed
theym for valyaunt and worthy men.
But the duke of Glouceſtre was of another
opinyon / for he wolde that his brother the duke
of Lancaſtre ſhuld haue bydden ſtyll in Acquytayne / 
for he thought he was ouer great
in Englande / and to nere the kynge / as for his
brother the duke of yorke he cared nat / for the
duke of yorke was a prince that loued his eaſe
and lytell buſyneſſe. Alſo he had a fayre lady
to his wyfe / doughter to the erle of Kent / on
whome was all his pleaſure. But the duke of
Glouceſtre was ſubtyle / and euer demaunded
ſomwhat of his nephue kynge Rycharde / yet
he was but poore / for all that he was a great
lorde and conſtable of Englande / and erle of
Hertforde & of Perces / and of Bokyngham / 
and alſo he had yerely out of the kynges cofers
foure thouſande nobles / and neuer rode
on the kinges buſyneſſe nor for the realme one
daye / without he knewe why and wherfore.
For theſe cauſes he was nat indyfferent / for
the maters of Acquytayne / for he wolde haue
had his brother of Lancaſtre to haue bydden
ſtill in Acquitayn for euer / for than he thought
he wolde haue ſhyfted well ynoughe in Englande.
As ſoone as he had ſayd his ſentence
(as ye haue herde before) and that he ſawe
ſome murmured in the kynges chambre / and
that the prelates and lordes talked togyther
two and two / he iſſued out of ye chambre / and
the erle of Derby with hym / and came in to
the hall at E
                  •
               tham / and made a clothe to be
layde on a table and ſo ſate / downe to dynner / 
and lefte all other ſtyll talkynge togyther.
Whan the duke of yorke knewe that he was at
dyner / he went to kepe hym company. and after
dyner whiche he made ſhorte / the duke of
Glouceſtre dyſſymuled the mater / and tooke
his leaue of the Kynge ſyttynge at the table / 
and ſo departed and toke his horſe and rode
to London / and the erle of Derby abode ſtyll
with the lordes that daye and the nexte daye.
Thus they of Acquytayne coulde haue none
expedicyon nor delyueraunce.
            I Haue delyght to write this mater at
length / bycauſe to enfourme you of
the trouthe / for I that am auctour of
this hyſtory was preſente in all theſe maters / 
and this valyaunt knyght ſyr Rycharde Surye
ſhewed me euery thynge. And ſo it was
that on the ſonday folowynge all ſuche as had
ben there were departed / and all their counſaylours / 
except the duke of yorke / who abode
ſtyll about the kynge / and the lorde Thomas
Percy and ſyr Rycharde Sury ſhewed my
buſyneſſe to the kynge. Than the kynge deſyred
to ſe my booke that I had brought for
hym. So he ſawe it in his chambre / for I had
layde it there redy on his bedde. Whanne the
Kynge opened it / it pleaſed hym well / for it
was fayre enlumyned and written / and couered
with crymſon veluet / with ten botons of

ſyluer and gylte / and Roſes of golde in the
myddes with two great clapſes gylte / rychely
wrought. Than the kyng demaunded
me wherof it treated / and I ſhewed hym / 
howe it treated of maters of loue / wherof the
kynge was gladde and loked in it / and reed
it in many places / for he coulde ſpeke and
rede Frenche very well. And he tooke it to a
knyght of his chambre named ſir Rycharde
Creadon / to beare it in to his ſecrete chambre.
And the ſame ſonday I fell in acquayntaunce
with a Squyer of Englande called
Henry Caſtyde / an honeſt man and a wyſe / 
and coude well ſpeke Frenche. He cōpanyed
with me / bicauſe he ſawe the kyng and other
lordes made me good chere / and alſo he had
ſene the boke that I gaue to the kynge. Alſo
ſir Richarde Sury had ſhewed hym howe
I was a maker of hyſtories. Than he ſayd
to me as here after foloweth.

            ¶The deuyſe / and of the conqueſt

and howe he brought in to his
obeyſaunce four kynges of that coū

               SIr Iohan quod he / haue
ye nat founde in the kynges
courte ſythe ye came hyder / 
no man that hath tolde
you of the voyage that the
kyng made but late in to Irlande / 
and in what maner
the foure kynges of Irelande are come in to
the obeyſaunce of the kynge of Englande?
And I aunſwered no. Than ſhall I ſhewe
you ꝙ the ſquyer / to the entent that ye maye
putte it in perpetuall memorie / whan ye retourne
in to your owne countrey / and haue
leyſar therto. I was reioyſed of his wordes
and thanked hym. Than he began thus and
ſayd. Sir Iohan / it is nat in memorie / that
euer any kyng of Englande made ſuche appareyle
and prouiſion for any iourney to make
warre agaynſt the yriſſhmen / nor ſuche a
nombre of men of armes nor archers. The
kyng was a nyne monethes in the marcheſſe
of Irelande to his great coſt / & charge to the
realme / for they bare all his expēſes. And the
marchaūtes / cyties / and good townes of the
realme thought it well beſtowed / whan they
ſawe the kynge retourne home agayne with
honour. The nombre that he had thyder / getylmen
and archers / were foure thouſande
knyghtes and .xxx. thouſande archers / well
payde wekely / that euery manne was well
pleaſed. but I ſhewe you / bycauſe ye ſhulde
knowe the tronthe. Irelande is one of the yuell
countreis of the worlde to make warre
vpon / or to bring vnder ſubiection. For it is
cloſed ſtrongely and wyldely with highe foreſtes
and great waters and mareſſhes / and
places inhabytable. It is harde to entre to
do them of the countrey any dōmage / nor ye
ſhall fynde no towne nor perſone to ſpeke wt
all. For the men drawe to the woodes / and
dwell in caues and ſmall cotagꝭ / vnder trees
and among buſſhes and hedges / lyke wylde
ſauage beeſtes. And whan they knowe that
any man maketh warre agaynſt thē / and is
entred in to their coūtreis / than they drawe
toguyder to the ſtraytes and paſſages / and
defende it / ſo that no man can entre in to thē.
And whan they ſe their tyme / they wyll ſone
take their aduauntage on their enemyes / for
they knowe the countrey and are lyght people.
For a man of armes beyng neuer ſo well
horſed / and ron as faſt as he can / the yriſſhe
men wyll ryn a fote as faſte as he and ouertake
hym / yea / and leape vp vpon his horſe
behynde hym / and drawe hym fro his horſe / 
for they are ſtronge men in the armes / and
haue ſharpe weapons with large blades wt
two edges / after the maner of darte heedes / 
wherwith they wyll ſlee their enemy / & they
repute nat a man deed / tyll they haue cutte
his throte / and opyn his bely and taken out
his herte / and cary it awaye with thē. ſome
ſaye / ſuche as knowe their nature / that they
do eate it / and haue great delyte therin. they
take no man to raunſome. And whan̄e they
ſe at any encountre / that they be ouermatched / 
than they wyll departe a ſonder / and
go and hyde theym ſelfe in buſſhes / wodes / 
hedges / and caues / ſo that no man ſhall finde
theym. Alſo ſyr Wylliam of Wyndſore / who
hath moſte vſed the warres in thoſe parties / 
of any other englyſſhe man / yet he coulde neuer

lerne the maner of ye countrey / nor knowe
their condycions. They be herde people and
of rude engen and wytte / and of dyuers frequentacyons
and vſage / they ſette nothyng
by iolyte nor freſſhe apparell / nor by nobleneſſe / 
for though their rleame be ſoueraynly
gouerned by kynges / wherof they haue plentie / 
yet they wyll take no knowledge of gentylneſſe
but wyll contynewe in their rudeneſſe / 
acordynge as they are brought vp. Trouthe
it is that foure of the princypall kynges and
moſte puyſſaunt / after the maner of the countrey / 
are come to the obeyſaunce of the kynge
of Englande by loue and fayreneſſe / and nat
by batayle nor conſtraynte. The erle of Ormonde
who marcheth vpon them hath taken
great payne / and hath ſo treated with them / 
that they came to Duuelyn to the kynge / and
ſubmytted them to hym / to be vnder the obeyſaunce
of the crowne of Englande / wherfore
the kyng and all the realme reputeth this for
a great and an honourable dede / and thynketh
this voyage well be ſtowed / for kynge Edwarde
of good memory dyd neuer ſo moche
vpon them as kynge Rycharde dyde in this
voyage. The honour is great but the profite
is but lytell: For though they be kynges
yet no man can deuyſe nor ſpeke of ruder perſonages.
            
               I Shall ſhewe you ſomwhat of
their rudeneſſe / to the entente it
maye be enſample agayne people
of other nacyons / I knowe
it well / for I haue proued it by
them ſelues / For whan they were at Duuelyn
I hadde the gouernaunce of them about
a moneth / by the kynges commauudement
and his counſayle / to thentent that I ſhulde
lerne them to vſe them ſelfe accordyng to the
vſage of Englande / & bycauſe I coulde ſpeke
their language / as well as Frenche or Englyſſhe / 
for in my youthe I was brought vp
amonge theym. I was with the erle of Ormonde / 
father to the Erle that nowe is / who
loued me right well / bycauſe I coulde as thā
ryde and handell an horſe metely well. And
it fortuned one tyme that the ſayde erle (who
as than was my maiſter) was ſent with thre
hundred ſpeares and a thouſande archers in
to the marcheſſe of Irelande / to make warre
with the yriſſhe men / for alwayes the Englyſſhe
men haue had warre with thē / to ſubdue
and putte them vnder. And on a daye as
the ſayd Erle went agaynſt thē / I rode on a
goodly horſe of his / lyght and ſwyfte: Thus
I rode & folowed my mayſter. And the ſame
day the yriſſhe men were layde in a buſſhement / 
and whan̄e we came nere theym / they
opyned their buſſhement. Thanne the Engliſſhe
archers began to ſhote ſo egerly that
the yriſſhe men coulde nat ſuffre it / for they
are but ſimply armed / therfore they reculed
and wente backe. Than̄e the Erle my mayſter
folowed in ye chaſe / and I that was well
horſed folowed hym as nere as I coude. and
it fortuned ſo that my horſe was afrayd / and
toke his bridell in his tethe and ranne away
with me / & whether I wolde or nat / he bare
me ſo farforthe amonge the yriſſhe men / that
one of them by lyghtneſſe of ronnynge lepte
vp behynde me / and enbraſed me in his armes / 
& dyde me none other hurt / but ſo ledde
me out of the way / and ſo rode ſtyll behynde
me the ſpace of two houres. And at the laſte
brought me in to a ſecrete place / thycke of
buſſhes / and there he founde his company
who were come thyder and ſcaped all daungers / 
for the Englyſſhe men purſued nat ſo
farre. Than as he ſhewed he had great ioye
of me / and ledde me in to a towne and a ſtrō
               ge
houſe amonge the woodes / waters / and
myres. The towne was called Harpely / and
the gētylman that toke me was called Brine
Coſteret. He was a goodly man / and as it
hath ben ſhewed me / he is as yet a lyue / how
be it he is very aged. This Brine Coſteret
kepte me ſeuyn yere with hym / and gaue me
his doughter in maryage / of whom I hadde
two doughters. I ſhall ſhewe you howe I
was delyuered.
            IT happened at the ſeuin yeres ende
one of their kynges named Arthur
mackemur / kyng of Lynſter / made
an armye agaynſt duke Lyon of Clarence / 
ſonne to kyng Edwarde of Englande / and agaynſt
ſir Wyllm̄ of Wynſore. And nat farre
fro the cytie of Lynſter the Englyſſhe men &
yriſſhe men mette toguyder / and many were
ſlayne and taken on bothe parties / But the
Englyſſhe men opteygned the vyctorie and
the yriſſhe men fledde / and the kyng Arthur
ſaued hym ſelfe / but Brine Coſteret my wyues

father was taken priſoner vnder the duke
of Clarence baner. He was taken on the
ſame courſer / that he toke me on. The horſe
was well knowen amonge the erle of Ormondes
folkes / and than he ſhewed howe I was
alyue and was at his maner of Harpelyn / &
howe I had wedded his doughter / wherof
the duke of Clarence / ſir Wylliam Wynſore / 
and the Englyſſhe men were ryght gladde.
Than̄e it was ſhewed hym that if he wolde
be delyuered out of priſon / that he ſhulde delyuer
me in to the Englyſſhe mennes hādes / 
and my wyfe and chyldren. With gret payne
he made that bargayne / for he loued me well
and my wyfe his doughter and our chyldren
Whan he ſawe he coulde make his fynaunce
none otherwyſe / he accorded therto / but he reteigned
myne eldeſt doughter ſtyll with him
So I and my wyfe and our ſeconde doughter
retourned in to Englande / and ſo I went
and dwelte beſyde Briſtowe on the ryuer of
Syuerne. My two doughters are maryed / 
and ſhe in Irelāde hath thre ſonnes and two
doughters / and ſhe that I brought with me
hath foure ſonnes and two doughters. & bycauſe
the langage of yriſſhe is as redy to me
as the Englyſſhe tong (for I haue alwayes
cōtynued with my wyfe / and taught my children
the ſame ſpeche) Therfore the kyng my
ſouerayne lorde and his counſayle / cōmaunded
me to gyue attendaūce on theſe four kynges / 
and to gouerne and bringe them to reaſon / 
and to the vſage & cuſtomes of Englāde
ſeyng they hadde yelded them to to be vnder
his obeyſaunce / & of the crowne of Englāde
and they were ſworne to holde it for euer. &
yet I enſure you / for all that / I dyde my power
to enſygne and to lerne them good maner / 
yet for all that they be ryght rude and of
groſe engyn / moche payne I hadde to make
them to ſpeke any thyng in fayre maner / ſomwhat
I altred them but nat moche / for in many
caſes they drewe to their naturall rudeneſſe.
The kyng my ſoueraygne lordes entent
was / that in maner / countenaunce / and
apparell of clothyng / they ſhulde vſe accordyng
to the maner of Englande / for the kynge
thought to make them all four knyghtes
they had a fayre houſe to lodge in in Duuelyn / 
and I was charged to abyde ſtyll with
them and nat to departe. And ſo two or thre
dayes I ſuffred them to do as they lyſt / and
ſayde nothynge to them / but folowed their
owne appetytes. They wolde ſytte at the table
and make coūtenaunce nother good nor
fayre. Than I thought I ſhulde cauſe thē
to chaunge that maner. They wolde cauſe
their myſtrelles / their ſeruauntes / and varlettes / 
to ſytte with them and to eate in their
owne dyſſhe / and to drinke of their cuppes.
And they ſhewed me / that the vſage of their
countre was good / for they ſayd / in all thynges
(except their beddes) they were and lyued
as cōmen. So the fourthe day I ordayned
other tables to be couered in the hall / after
ye vſage of Englande. And I made theſe
four kynges to ſytte at the hyghe table / and
there mynſtrels at another borde / and their
ſeruantes and varlettes at another byneth
them / wherof by ſemynge they were diſpleaſed / 
and behelde eche other & wolde nat care / 
and ſayd / howe I wolde take fro them their good
vſage / wherin they hadde been noriſſhed.
Than I anſwered them ſmylyng to a
peace theym / that it was nat honourable for
their eſtates to do as they dyde before / and
that they muſt leaue it / and vſe the cuſtom of
Englande / and that it was the kynges pleaſure
they ſhulde ſo do / and how he was charged
ſo to order them. Whan they harde that
they ſuffred it / bycauſe they had putte them
ſelfe vnder the obeyſaūce of the kyng of Englande / 
and parceuered in the ſame as long
as I was with them. yet they hadde one vſe
whiche I knewe well was vſed in their coū
               tre / 
and that was they dyde were no breches
I cauſed breches of lynen clothe to be made
for them. Whyle I was with them I cauſed
them to leaue many rude thynges / aſwell in
clothyng as in other cauſes. Moche ado I
had at the fyrſt to cauſe them to weare gownes
of ſylke furred with Myneuere & gray / 
For before theſe kynges thought them ſelfe
well apparelled whan they hadde on a mantell.
They rode alwayes without ſadelles &
ſtyropes / and with great payne I made thē
to ryde after our vſage. Andon a tyme I demaunded
thē of their beleue / wherwith they
were nat content / and ſayd / howe they beleued
on god and on the trynite / aſwell as we.
Than I demaūded on what pope was their
affection The aunſwered me on hym of Rome.
Than̄e I demaunded if they wolde nat
gladly receyue the order of knyghthode / and

that the kyng of Englande ſhulde make thē
knyghtes / accordynge to the vſage of Fraū
               ce
and Englande / and other countreis. they
aunſwered howe they were knyghtes all redye / 
and that ſuffyced for theym. I aſked
where they were made knyghtes / and howe
and whan. They anſwered / yt in the age of ſeuyn
yere they were made knyghtes in Irelande / 
And that a kynge maketh his ſonne a
knyght. and if the ſonne haue no father alyue / 
than the nexte of his blode maye make
hym knyght. And than̄e this yonge knyght
ſhall begyn to iuſte with ſmall ſpeares / ſuche
as they maye beare with their caſe / and
rynne agaynſt a ſhelde / ſette on a ſtake in the
felde / and the more ſpeares that he breaketh / 
the more he ſhalbe honoured. I knewe their
maner well ynough / though I dyde demaū
               de
it. But than I ſayd / that the knighthode
that they had taken in their youthe / ſuffyced
nat to the kynge of Englande. But I ſayde
he ſhulde gyue theym after another maner.
They demaunded howe. I aunſwered / that
it ſhulde be in the holy churche / whiche was
the mooſt worthyeſt place. Than they enclyned
ſomewhat to my wordes. Within two
dayes after the erle of Ormonde came to thē
who coude right well ſpeke the langage / for
ſome of his landes laye in thoſe parties. He
was ſente to them by the kynge and his coū
               ſayle.
They all honoured hym and he them.
Than he fell in ſwete communycacion with
them / and he demaunded of them howe they
lyked me. They aunſwered and ſayde / well
for he hath well ſhewed vs the vſage of this
countrey / wherfore we ought to thanke him / 
and ſo we do. This aunſwere pleaſed well
the erle of Ormonde. Than he entred lytell
and lytell to ſpeke of the order of chiualry / 
whiche the kyng wolde they ſhulde receyue
He ſhewed it them fro poynt to poynt / howe
they ſhulde behaue them ſelfe / and what parteygned
to knyghthode. The erles wordes
pleaſed moche theſe four kynges / whoſe names
were theſe. Fyrſt the great Ancle kyng
of Mecte. The ſeconde Brine of Thomōde
kynge of Thomonde. The thyrde Arthure
of Mackequemur kynge of Lynſter. The
fourthe Conhue / kyng of Cheueno & Darpe
They were made knightes by kyng Richarde
of Englande in the Cathedrall churche of
Duuelyn / dedycate of ſaynt Iohan Baptyſt
It was done on our lady day in Marche / as
than it fell on a Thurſday. Theſe four kynges
watched all the night before in the churche / 
and the nexte daye at highe maſſe tyme / 
with great ſolēpnyte they were made knightes / 
and with them ſir Thomas Orphen / ſir
Ioatas Pado / and ſir Iohan Pado his coſyn.
Theſe kynges ſate that day at the table
with kyng Rycharde. They were regarded
of many folkes / bicauſe there behauyng was
ſtraunge to the maner of Englande / and other
countreis / and euer naturally men deſyre
to ſe newelties. Than I ſir Iohn̄ Froiſſart
ſayde. Henry / I beleue you well: & I wolde
it had coſt me largely that I had been there.
And ſurely this yere paſt I hadde come hyder
and it hadde nat been / for that I herde of
the dethe of quene Anne of Englande / whiche
dyde lette me. But one thynge I wolde
deſyre of you to knowe / howe theſe four kynges
of Irelande came ſo ſoone to the kynge
of Englandes obeyſaunce / whan kynge Edwarde
the kynges graunfather / who was ſo
valyaunt a prince and ſo redouted ouer all / 
coude neuer ſubdue them nor putte them vnder / 
and yet he had alwayes warre with thē.
and in that they are ſubdued nowe / ye ſayd it
was by treatie / and by the grace of god. In
dede the grace of god is good / who ſo can haue
it / it is moche worthe. But it is ſene nowe
a dayes / that erthely princes getteth lytell wt
               out
it be by puiſſaūce. I deſyre to know this
for whan I ſhall cōe in to Heynalt / of which
countrey I am of / I ſhalbe examyned of this
and many other thynges / bothe by duke Aubert
of Bauier / erle of Heynalte / of Holande
and of zelande / and alſo by his ſonne Wyllm̄
of Bauyere / who writeth hym ſelfe lorde of
Freſe / whiche is a great countrey and a puiſſaunt / 
whiche coūtrey the ſayd duke and his
ſonne claymeth to haue by ryght ſucceſſyon / 
and ſo dyde their predeceſſours before them / 
but the Freſons wolde neuer fall to any reaſon / 
nor come vnder obeyſaūce / nor as yet do
nat vnto this day. than anſwered ſir Henry
Chriſtall & ſayd. Sir Iohan / to ſhewe you
the very trouth I can nat / but as many a one
ſaythe / & it is to ſuppoſe / yt the great puiſſaū
               ce
yt the kyng had ouer with him / and taryed
there in their countrey nyne monethes / and
euery man well payed / abaſſhed the yriſſhe
men. Alſo the ſee was cloſed fro them on all

partes / wherby their lyuēges and marchaū
               diſes
myght nat entre in to their countreys / 
thoughe they that dwell farre within the realme
cared lytell for it (for they knowe natte
what marchaundyſe meaneth / nor they lyue
but groſely and rudely like vnto beeſtes) yet
ſuche as lyueth on the marcheſſe of England
and by the See cooſt / vſe feate of marchaundyſe
with vs / and in to other places. Kynge
Edwarde of noble memorie in his tyme / had
to anſwere ſo many warres / what in Fraūce
Bretayne / Gaſcone / and Scotlande / ſo that
his people were deuyded in dyuers places / 
& ſore occupyed / wherfore he coude nat ſende
no great nombre in to Irelande. But whan
the Iryſſhmen ſawe ye great nombre of men
of warre that kyng Rycharde hadde in Irelande
this laſte iourney / The yriſſhmen aduyſed
them ſelfe and came to obeyſaūce. And
in dede / of olde tyme there was a kyng in Englāde
named Edwarde / who is a ſaynt and
canonyſed / and honoured through all this realme.
In his tyme he ſubdued the Danes / &
diſconfyted them by batayle on the See thre
tymes. And this ſaint Edwarde kyng of Englande / 
lorde of Irelande and of Acquitayn
the yriſſhmen loued and dredde hym moche
more / than any other kyng of Englande that
had been before. And therfore our ſouerayne
lorde kyng Richarde / this yere paſt / whan he
was in Irelande / in all his armories and deuyſes / 
he lefte the beryng of the armes of Englande / 
as the lybardes & flour delyces quarterly / 
and bare the armes of this ſaynt Edwarde / 
that is a croſſe patent golde and goules
with four white martenettes in the felde / 
wherof it was ſaid / the yriſſhmen were well
pleaſed / and the ſoner they enclyned to hym / 
For of trouthe / ye predeceſſours of theſe four
kynges obeyed with faithe and homage to ye
ſayd kyng Edwarde / and they repute kynge
Richarde a good man and of good cōſcience
and ſo they haue done to hym faithe & homage / 
as they ought to do: and in like maner as
their predeceſſours ſōtyme dyde to ſaynt Edwarde.
Thus I haue ſhewed you the maner
how the kyng our ſouerayne lorde hath this
yere accomplyſſhed and furnyſſhed his voyage
in Ireland: put it in your memoriall / to
the entent / that whan ye ſhall retourne in to
your owne countrey / ye may write it in your
cronicle / with many other hyſtories that depende
to the ſame matter. Than I thanked
hym / and ſayd it ſhulde be done. So I toke
leaue of hym. Than I mette with Marche
the heraulde / and I demaūded of hym what
armes this Henry Chriſtell bare / and I ſhewed
the heraulde / howe this ſir Henry had
ſhewed me the maner of the kynges torney
in Irelande / and the ſtate of the foure kynges / 
who had ben (as he ſayd) in his gouernyng / 
more than fyftene dayes at Duuelyn.
The heraulde anſwered me and ſayd. Sir / 
he beareth in his armes Syluer / a cheuerne
goules / thre beſans goules. All theſe thyngꝭ
I dyde putte in writynge / bycauſe I wolde
nat forgette them.
            THus I taryed in the kynge of Englandes
courte / as longe as it pleaſed
me / nat always in one place / for
the kynge often tymes remoued / to Eltham / 
to Ledes / to Kyngſtone / to Shene / to Charſey / 
or to Wyndſore / aboute the marcheſſe of
London. And I was enformed of a trouthe
that the kyng wrote to his vncle the duke of
Lancaſtre / for they of Acquitayne ſpedde ſo
in their buſyneſſe / that their countrey abode
ſtyll to the crowne of Englande. Than̄e it
was concluded by generall counſayle of Englande / 
that the gyfte that the kynge hadde
gyuen to the duke of Lancaſtre / muſt nedes
abyde ſtyll as his owne: howe be it the duke
of Glouceſtre wolde that his brother myght
haue enioyed the kynges gyfte / but his ſaying
coulde nat be herde in that caſe / For they
of the Realme of Englande (bycauſe of doutes
and caſualtyes in tyme to come) herde
well the wordes of theym of Burdeaux and
of Bayone. And conſydred well / that yf the
herytage of Acquitaygne were putte fro the
Crowne of Englande / it ſhulde be in tyme
to come a great preiudice to the realme / whiche
they wolde in no wiſe ſhulde fortune / for
alwayes Burdeux & Bayon / and the frōters
and marches of Gaſcon / had kept & augmented
greatly / the honour of the realme of Englande.
Theſe thyngꝭ were well cōſydred of
the wyſe men of the kynges coūſayle / ye duke
of Glouceſtre abſent / for before hym no man
durſt ſpeke. ſo the mater abode in this caſe.
¶We ſhall leaue of this matter / and ſpeke

as the erle of Rutlande and therle marſhall / 

and other / that were ſente in to Fraunce to
treate of the maryage bytwene kynge Rycharde
their lorde and the doughter of Charles
Frenche kyng / who was but eyght yeres
of age / and I ſhall ſhewe you howe they
ſpedde.

Capi. CC.iii.
            
               THeſe Englyſſhe lordes
rode fro Calais to Amyence
and to Clermount
in Beauuoſyn / & ſo to Parys / 
and ī euery place they
were well receyued by the
cōmaundement of the frenche
kyng. They were lodged about yt croſſe
of Tyrouer: They were a fyue hundred horſes.
The Frenche kynge was lodged at the
caſtell of Lour / and the quene and her chyldren
at the houſe of ſaynt Poule / vpon the ryuer
of Seyne. The duke of Berrey at the
houſe of Neſle / the duke of Burgoyne at the
houſe of Arthoyſe / and the duke of Burbone
in his owne houſe / the duke of Orlyaūce / the
erle of ſaynt Poule / and the lorde of Coucy / 
at their owne houſes. The kynge had aſſembled
there all his counſayle / to the entent to
make the better anſwere to thembaſſadours
of Englande. The kyng had cōmaūded that
euery day there ſhulde be delyuered to theſe
ambaſſadours two hūdred crownes of Frā
               ce / 
for their ſmall expences / and for their horſes.
And the chiefe of theſe Englyſſhe lordes
as the erle Marſhall and therle of Rutlāde
were often tymes with the kynge and dyned
with hym. they had as good there as coulde
be deuyſed / for the loue of the kynge of Englāde.
Theſe lordes deſyred euer to haue an
anſwere / & they were euer fedde forthe with
fayre wordes. For the noble men of Fraunce
had great marueyle of the requeſtes of the
Englyſſhe men. And that the kynge of Englande
wolde marry with Fraunce / ſeynge
that the warre had ben ſo cruell / and ſo long
endured. And ſome of the Frenche kynges
counſayle ſayd / howe maye our kyng agree
to gyue his doughter in maryage to his aduerſary / 
or this treatie ſhulde be made. We
thynke we ſhall haue peace with Englande
by ſome other wayes / though it be nat by the
meanes of maryage. And as at yt tyme there
was a valyaunt knyght of the Frenche kynges
counſayle / called ſir Raynalt of Corby.
He was a farre caſtyng man / and conſydred
what myght fall in tyme to come. Than̄e he
ſayd to the kyng and to his vncles. My lordes
and mayſters. A man ſhulde entre in at
the ryght dore in to a houſe. It ſemeth that
kyng Richarde of Englāde wolde nothyng
to you nor to the realme / but loue and all fauour / 
ſeynge that by reaſon of maryage / he
wolde alye hym to you. Two tymes your
counſaylours and his haue mette toguyder
at Amyence and at Balyngham / to treate for
a peace / & yet they coulde neuer take no good
concluſyon / but on the ſtate of a truce. And
ſir / it is well knowen / that Thomas duke of
Glouceſtre kyng Richardes vncle / is of a cō
               trary
opinyon / againſt ye king and his other
two vncles / the dukes of Lācaſtre & of yorke.
The kyng nor other can nat make hym agre
wyllingly to haue peace / howe be it his puiſſaunce
canne natte reſyſt the kynges power.
Therfore ſir / after myne opynyon / receyue
this offre and refuce nat this treatie / and let
theſe lordes haue ſuche aunſwere / as maye
cōtent them. Than the kyng and his vncles
agreed therto / and ſpecially the duke of Burgoyne / 
for he was ſo ſore charged by reaſon
of the warres / yt gladly he wolde haue peace
and the prīcypall cauſe was / bycauſe of Flaū
               ders / 
wherof he claymed to be lorde by reaſon
of his wyfe / bycauſe that countrey marched
vpon Englande. And alſo the hertes of
the Flemynges were rather Englyſſhe than
Frenche / bycauſe of the entrecourſe of marchaundyſe / 
bytwene England & Flaunders
by See and by lande.
            THan it was concluded by the Frenche
kynges counſayle / that there ſhulde
be as good there made to the Englyſſhmen

as was before. And whether it was by diſſymulacyon
or otherwyſe / the frenche men were
determyned to make a good and a ſwere aunſwere
to the engliſſhe men / and to put them in
hope that the kynge of Englande ſhulde haue
his deſyre. The quene and her chyldren laye
at the houſe of faynt Powleꝭ and where as the
Englyſſhe lordes deſyred to ſe theym / it was
graunted to them / and ſpecyally to ſe her / for
whome their treatie was. than it was ſhewed
them that they muſte be content howe ſo euer
they founde her / for they ſayde ſhe was but a
yonge chylde of eyght yere of age / wherfore
they ſayd / there coulde nat be in her no great
wyſdome nor prudence / howe be it ſhe was
indoctryned well ynough / and that the lordes
founde well / whan they ſawe her. The Erle
Marſhall beynge on his knees ſayde to her.
Fayre lady / by the grace of god ye ſhall be our
lady and quene of Englande. Than aunſwered
the yonge lady well aduyſedly / without
counſayle of any other perſon. Syr quod ſhe / 
and it pleaſe god and my lorde my father that
I ſhall be quene of Englande / I ſhall be glad
therof / for it is ſhewed me that I ſhall be than
a great lady. Than ſhe toke vp the erle Marſhall
by the hande and ledde him to the quene
her mother / who had great ioy of the anſwere
that ſhe had made / and ſo were all other that
herde it. The maner / countenaunce / and behauoure
of this yonge lady / pleaſed greatly the
Ambaſſadours / and they ſayd amonge them
ſelfe / that ſhe was lykely to be a lady of hygh
honoure and great goodneſſe. Thus whan
theſe lordes of Englande had ben at Parys a
twenty dayes / and their coſtes and charges
payed for by the frenche kynge / a reaſonable
aunſwere was gyuen them / ſo that they were
put in great hope to bringe aboute that they
came for / howe be it the frenche men ſayd / it
coulde nat be doone ſhortly / bycauſe the lady
was ſo yonge / and alſo ſhe was fyanſed to the
duke of Bretayns eldeſt ſonne / wherfore they
ſayd they muſt treat to breke that promeſſe / or
they coude procede any further in that mater / 
and thervpon the frenche kynge and his counſayle
ſhulde ſende into Englande the next lent
after / to ſhewe howe the matter wente. And
whan the dayes begyn to encreace and waxe
fayre / Than the kynge of Englande to ſende
agayne in to Fraunce whome it ſhulde pleaſe
hym / and they ſhulde be welcome. With this
aunſwere the englyſſhe men were contented
and toke leaue of the quene and of her doughter / 
and of the kynge / and of all other / and departed
fro Paris and toke the ſame way they
came and ſo retourned to Calays / and than
in to Englande. and the two erles rode in poſt
before their company / to bringe tydynges to
the kyng▪ they rode fro Sandwiche to Wynd
ſore in leſſe thanne a daye and an halfe. The
kynge was ryght ioyouſe of their comynge / 
and was well contente with the frenche kynges
aunſwere. He ſet the mater ſo to his herte
that he toke great pleaſure therin / and tooke
hede to none other thynge / but ſtudyed howe
he myght bringe it aboute to haue the frenche
kinges doughter to wyfe.
            ON the otherſyde the Frenche kynge
and his counſayle ſtudyed daye and
nyght / howe they myght make this
maryage with Englande to the honour of the
realme of Fraunce. There were many in the
realme of Fraunce that ſayd / that if they had
been called to theſe treatyes / and our wordes
herde / the kynge of Englande ſhulde neuer
haue the doughter of Fraunce / for any maner
of peace. What good ſhulde it be for Fraunce / 
ſeynge the trewce bytwene them endured but
for two yere to come / and than ſhall we fall agayne
in warre / and eche of vs hate other as
we haue doone before? The dukes of Berrey
and Orlyance were of the ſame opynion / and
dyuers other lordes of Fraūce. But the king / 
the duke of Burgoyne / and the chauncellour
of Fraunce / enclyned to this maryage / and
gladde to haue peace / reſeruyng alwayes the
honour of the Realme. The ſame tyme there
was a ſquier in Fraunce of the nacyon of Normandy
in the countrey of Caulx / he had in his
dayes ben ſore traueyled in farre parties / and
as than he was newly retourned into Fraūce / 
his name was Robert le menuot / but as than
he was called Robert the Hermyte / he was relygyous
and of good lyfe / of the age of fyfty
yere / he had been at the treaties that was
holden at Balyngham / at whiche
tyme he was well herde / and
howe he entred than in
to that treatie I
ſhall ſhewe

            ¶Of a Squyer named Roberte the
Hermyte / howe he was ſente to the
treaties of the peace holden at Balyngham
& howe he was after ſente
in to Englande to kynge Rycharde
and his vncles. Cap. CC.iiii.
            
               SO it was / whan this
Roberte the Hermyte returned
in to Fraūce out of
the parties of Surey / and
toke ſhyppyng at Baruch.
Whyle he was vpon the ſee
a great tempeſt of wynde
roſe / in ſuche wyſe that they feared to be peryſſhed / 
and euery man tell to make his prayers
to god. And at the ende of this tempeſt / and
that the wether began to waxe fayre and clere / 
there apered to Robert ye Hermyte an ymage
more clere than Cryſtall / and ſayd thu
                  •
               . Robert / 
thou ſhalte iſſue and eſcape this parell / 
and all thy company for loue of the / for god
hath herde thyne oriſons and prayers / and he
ſendeth the worde by me / that thou ſhuldeſt
make haſt in to Fraunce / and go to the kynge
and ſhewe him thyne aduenture / and ſay vnto
him / that in any wyſe he enclyne to haue peace
with his aduerſary kynge Rycharde of Englande / 
and amonge them that be treaters of
the peace / preace thou forthe and ſhewe them
thyne aduyſyon / for thou ſhalte be herde. and
ſay that all ſuche as be of the contrary opinyon
againſt the peace / ſhall bye it derely in their
lyfe tyme in this worlde. And therwith ye clereneſſe
and voyce vanyſſhed away. Than Robert
abode in a great ſtudy / but he remembred
well what he hadde ſene and herde / by the deuyne
inſpyracyon. And after this aduenture
they had fayre wether and the wynde at their
wyſſhynge / and than aryued in the Ryuer of
Gennes: and there Robert the Hermyte toke
leaue of his company / and went by lande fro
thence tyll he came to Auygnon. And the fyrſt
thynge he dyd he went to the churche of ſaynt
Peter / and there foūde a good vertuous man
a penytenſer and of hym he was cōfeſſed / and
ſhewed hym all his aduenture / and demaunded
counſayle what was beſt to do. Than his
gooſtly father charged hym in any wyſe / that
he ſhulde ſpeke nothynge of this mater tyll he
had ſhewed it fyrſte to the frenche kynge / and
loke what counſayle the kynge dyd gyue him
ſo to do. This Robert folowed his counſayle
and arayed hym ſelfe in ſymple habyte all in
gray / and ſo poorely departed fro Auygnon / 
and iourneyed ſo longe that he came to Parys / 
but the kynge was at Abbeuyle / and the
treatie beganne at Balyngham bytwene the
frenche men and Englyſſhe men (as ye haue
herde before) Than this Robert came to Abuyle
and drewe to the kynge / and a knyght of
his acquayntaunce brought him to the kyng / 
whiche knyght was of Normandy / and was
called ſir Willyam Martell / he was of the kynges
priuy chambre. Than Roberte the Hermyte
ſhewed the Kynge all his hole iourney
and aduēture. The kyng herde hym well / and
bycauſe the duke of Burgoyne and ſyr Raynolde
Corby chauncellour of Fraunce (who
were of the kynges opynyon to haue peace)
were at Balyngham in ye treatie holden there / 
the kynge ſayd to Robert. Our counſayle as
nowe is nat here / they be at Balyngham. ye
ſhall abyde here with me / and whan they be retourned
I ſhall ſpeke with myne vncle of Burgoyne
and with our chauncelloure / and than
we ſhall do in this mater / as they ſhall aduyſe
me. ſyr quod this Robert / as god wyll ſo be it.
            THe ſame weke the Frenche kynges
counſayle returned fro Balyngham
to Abbeuyle / and brought with them
the artycles of the maner of the peace / whiche
the englyſſhe men had deuyſed. and the maters
were ſo weyghty that the treatie was put
ouer tyll another daye / vnto ſuche tyme as
bothe kynges were aduertyſed of eche others
demaundes / and their pleaſures therin to be
knowen. Than on ye frenche partie the frenche
kynge drewe a parte his vncle of Burgoyne
and the chauncellour / and ſhewed them what
enfourmacyon Robert the Hermyt had made
vnto him / and the kynge demaunded of them
if it were a thynge lyſytte and lawfull to beleue.
They ſtudyed a lytell and at laſt ſayde.
Syr / we requyre youre grace lette vs ſe this
hermyte and here hym ſpeke / and thervpon
we wyll take aduyſe. Than he was ſent for.
Whan he came before the kynge he made his
reuerence. Thanne the kynge ſayd Roberte / 
ſhewe vs here at length all the hole mater / as
ye enfourmed me before. Sir quod he gladly.

Than as he that was nothynge abaſſhed / reherſed
all the hole mater / as ye haue herde before.
Whan he had doone he departed. Than
the kynge aſked of his vncle what was beſt to
be done. Syr quod he / the chauncellour and
I ſhall take aduyſe agaynſt to morowe. Well
quod the kynge / ſo be it. Than the duke and
the chauncellour counſayled togyther on this
mater. They ſawe well the kynge greatly enclyned
to this Robertes wordes / therfore they
thought it good to aduyſe the kynge to ioyne
this Robert in cōmyſſion with them to go agayne
to Balyngham to the treatie of peace / 
for they thought his langage ſo fayre and ſo
ſwete / that he ſhulde ſtyrre the hartes of them
that ſhulde here hym ſpeke / to haue peace / and
to ſhewe the deuyne vyſion that he had / to the
lordes of Englande. This they thought lawfull
ynough to be done / and the nexte day they
ſhewed this to the king. And than after whan
the duke and the chauncellour wente agayne
to Balyngham / they had this Roberte with
them. And whan all the lordes frenche and englyſſhe
were aſſembled togyder in counſayle / 
than this Robert came before them / and there
well and wiſely he declared all the vyſion that
he hadde on the ſee / and affermed that it was
inſpyracyon deuyne ſente by god / bycauſe he
wolde it ſhulde be ſo. Some of the lordes of
Englande toke good hede to this mater and
enclyned therto / as the duke of Lancaſtre / the
erle of Salyſbury / the lorde Thomas Percy
and other / the byſſhops of Lyncolne and London / 
but the duke of Glouceſtre and the erle of
Arundell / toke no hede nor ſet nothynge therby.
Whan they were in their lodgynges they
ſayd / they were but fantaſies / and wordes fayned
by the frenchmen to abuſe them all / howe
be it they determyned to write to kynge Rycharde
the maner and ſayenge of this Robert
the Hermyte / and thervpon ſent a knyght called
Rycharde Credon to kynge Rychardeꝭ
who he founde in Kent / at the caſtell of Leades / 
and delyuered him letters ſent fro his ambaſſadours
in the marches of Calays / wherin
was conteyned the hole ſayenge of this Robert.
The kynge tooke great pleaſure in theſe
letters / and ſayd howe he wolde gladly ſpeke
with this Robert the hermyte / he beleued this
vyſion to be of trouthe. Than the kyng wrote
agayne to the duke of Lancaſtre and to the
erle of Salyſbury / that if it myght be by any
meanes / that a good peace myght be taken bytwene
hym and the frenche kynge / their realmes
and alyes / for he ſayde ſurely he thought
that the warre had ouerlonge endured / and
that it was tyme to haue peace. And ye haue
herd here before howe the treaters bare them / 
and how the lordes departed one fro another / 
and howe the treuce was taken to endure for
foure yere. This was the entent of the lordes
of the englyſſh party / except the duke of Glouceſtre / 
for he thought whan ſo euer he came in
to Englande / neuer to agree to any peace bytwene
Fraunce and Englande. He dyſſimuled
as moche as he might / to thentent to pleaſe
the king and his brother of Lancaſtre. Thus
by this meanes Roberte le Hermyte came to
knowledge.
            ANd as ye haue herde here before / how
the erle of Rutlande / therle Marſhall / 
the archebyſſhop of Dunelyn / the lorde Hugh
Spenſer / the lorde Lewes Clyfforde and other / 
had been ſent in to Fraunce to treate for
kynge Rychardes maryage / and were retourned
agayne in to Englande / and brought the
kynge good tydynges / ſo that the kynge was
well pleaſed / as ye haue herde before. Than
Mychelmas came / and the generall coūſayle
began / ſuche as englyſſhe men call the terme / 
wherin all maters be debated / and at the begynnynge
of the ſayd terme the duke of Lancaſtre
returned out of Gaſcon in to Englande
and had nat ben receyued there / as he thought
he ſhulde haue been (as ye haue herde before)
So whan the duke of Lancaſtre was retourned / 
the kyng made hym good chere. Tydinges
anone came in to Fraunce howe the duke
of Lancaſtre was retourned in to Englande.
than the frenche kynge and his counſayle determyned
to ſende Robert the Hermyte into
Englande with letters to the kynge / who deſyred
to ſe hym / and that the erle of ſaynt Poll
ſhulde acquaynte hym with ye kyng and with
the lordes / that they myght here hym ſpeake
of the buſyneſſe of Surey and Tartary / and
of the greate Turke and Turkey / where he
had ben longe / for it was thought that the lordes
of Englande wolde gladly here ſpeakyng
of ſuche maters. Than this Robert the Hermyte
was warned to make hym redy to go in
to Englande in cōmyſſion / wherof he greatly
reioyſed / bycauſe he had neuer been there before

So he had letters delyuered hym / dyrected
to the kyng of Englande and to his vncles.
Thus Robert departed fro Parys with
ſeuen horſes at the coſt and charge of the frenche
kynge / and rode tyll he came to Boloyne / 
and there tooke the ſee and aryued at Douer / 
and ſpedde ſo in his iourneys that he came to
Eltham and founde the kynge there / and the
Duke of Lancaſtre / the erles of Salyſbury / 
and Huntyngdon / & the lorde Thomas Percy / 
and for the honour of the frenche kynge he
was well receyued / and ſpecyally of the kynge
who deſyred greatly to ſe hym. Than he delyuered
his letters of credence / whiche were
redde ouer by the kynge and the other lordes.
The duke of Glouceſtre was nat the
                  •
                he was
in Eſſex / at a Caſtell of his called Plaſſhey.
Whan this Robert had been with the kynge
and with the duke of Lancaſtre at Eltham a
fyue daies he departed thens to goſe the duke
of Glouceſtre / and ſo toke leaue of the kynge
and of the lordes and came to London / and
the next day rode fyftene myle fro London to
a towne called Brendwode / and the next day
to Plaſſhey / and there he founde the duke and
the Ducheſſe / and their chyldren / who ryght
goodly receyued hym acordyng to his degre.
Than Robert delyuered hym his letters ſent
fro the frenche kyng. And whan the duke ſawe
they were of credence / he drewe this Robert a
parte / and demaunded what credence he had.
Robert aunſwered hym and ſayd / ſyr I ſhall
ſhewe therin to you at good leyſer / I am nat
come to departe agayne ſo ſoone. Well quod
the duke ye be welcome. This Robert knewe
well ynough that the duke of Glouceſtre was
a ſore dyſlymulynge prince / and contrary to
any peace / and thought it harde to breke hym
fro his opinyon / for he knewe well he was alwaies
contrary to the peace / whiche was well
ſene at the treaties at Balyngham / for he neuer
demaunded but to haue warre. yet for all
that Robert the Hermyte ſpared nat to ſpeke
to the duke on the forme of peace. Alwayes he
founde the duke colde in aunſwers / and ſayd
the mater lay nat in hym / for he had two elder
bretherne / the duke of Lancaſtre and the duke
of yorke / to whome the mater partayned rather
than to hym / and alſo that if he wolde conſent
therto alone / peraduenture the other lordes / 
prelates / and counſaylours of good townes / 
wolde nat accepte it. Well quod Robert
the Hermyte / for the loue of our lorde Iheſu
Chriſt be ye nat contrarye to the peace / for ye
maye do moche / and alſo ye ſe well howe the
kyng your nephue enclyneth to the peace / and
wyll by maryage haue the Frenche kynges
doughter / by whiche coniunctyon ſhalbe gret
alyaunce of peace and loue. Than the duke
aunſwered and ſayd. What though ye be beleued
and herde at this tyme / with the kynges
and lordes of bothe realmes / and that ye haue
good audyēce with them and with their counſaylours / 
the mater is ſo hygh and weyghty / 
that it is conuenyent that greater perſonages
than ye / ſhulde me
                  •
               le therwith / I haue tolde
you / and often tymes I haue ſaid that I ſhall
neuer be contrary to the peace / ſo it be to the
honoure of the kynge and the Realme of Englande.
In tyme paſte peace was taken bytwene

and the frenche party ſworne and bounde vppon
payne of ſentence of the pope / and yet it

broken all couenauntes / & haue taken agayne
poſſeſſyon of all the landes and lordeſhyppes
that were yelded & delyuered at the peace makyng / 
to our ſayd ſouerayne lorde and father /

that alyaunce dyſheryte the Crowne of Englande / 
& his ſucceſſours to come / of ye clayme
of Fraunce. Ah ryght dere lorde quod Robert
our lorde Ieſu Chriſt ſuffered paſſyon on the
Croſſe for vs all ſynners / and pardoned his
dethe to them that crucyfied him: in lykewyſe
a man muſt pardon that wyll come to the glory
of heuen / and ſir all yuell wylles / hates / and
rancoures were pardoned / the daye that the
peace was made and ſealed at Calays by our
predeceſſours / and nowe warres haue been a
game newly renewed bytwene your men and
ours / I thynke ſurely through faulte on bothe
parties / for whan the prince of Wales duke of

Acquytayne was retourned out of Spayne
in to Acquytayne / there were a certayne maner
of people callyng themſelfe companyons / 
wherof the moſte partye were englyſſhe men
and gaſcons / holdynge of the kynge of Englande
and of the prince of Wales. Theſe people
aſſembled them togyther and entred in to
the realme of Fraunce / without any tytell of
reaſon / wherby enſued mortall & eruell warre
greater than was before. Theſe companyons
called the realme of Fraunce their chambre / 
they were ſo ſet to do yuell dedes / yt they coude
nat be reſyſted. And whan ye realme of Fraūce
ſawe and felte them ſo harmed by this people / 
and ſawe well the lengar they contynewed the
more they multyplyed & more hurte they dyd.
than kyng Charles of Fraūce / ſonne to kyng
Iohan / was coūſayled by his ſubgiettes to reſyſt
& ſubdue ſuche enemyes / outher by warre
or otherwyſe / and many great barons of Gaſcoyne
came to the frenche kyng / ſuche as ſaid
they were ſore ouerlayde with their lorde the
prince of Wales / & many iniuryes done to thē / 
whiche they ſhewed to the frenche kynge they
might nat nor Wolde nat ſuffre no lenger / and
ſo they beganne the warre bycauſe of their reſorte
to the prince of Wales. Than this kynge
Charles by counſayle of them and of his ſubgiettes / 
enhardyed himſelfe to the warre with
theſe barones of Gaſcoyn / for to mete againſt
theſe companyons. And in this newe warre
many lordes retourned to the frenche kynge / 
and dyuers lordeſhyppes / cyties / townes / and
caſtels / for the great oppreſſion that the prince
of Wales dyd to thē / and conſented to be done
by his cōmyſſioners. Thus the warre was renewed / 
wherby many great myſchyefes haue
fallen / to the dyſtruction of moche people and
countreys / and the faythe of Chriſt ſore febled
and decayed / & the enemyes of god ryſſen and
coraged / and haue all redy conquered moche
parte of Grece. the emperour of Conſtantynople / 
hath nat the power to reſyſt the puyſſaūce
of the great turke / called Baſant Lamorabaquyn / 
who hathe conquered the realme of
Armony / excepte all onely a towne ſtandynge
on the ſee ſyde / called Tourche / whiche the venyſians
and genouoys kepe agaynſt ye turke / 
and the emperour of Conſtantyne the noble / 
who is of your blode / he was ſonne to the emperoure
Hugues of Luzignen and of my lady
Mary of Burbon / coſyn germayne to my
lady the quene your mother / he ſhall nat be able
of longe to reſyſt the puyſſaūce of this gret
turke. and if peace maye be had bytwene Englande
and Fraunce / as I truſt by the grace of
god it ſhall be / than knyghtes & ſquyers ſuche
as demaunde for dedes of armes for their aduauncement / 
ſhall drawe them to that parte / 
and ſhall helpe kynge Lyon of Armony to recouer
agayne his herytage / and to put out the
turkes. for ſurely the warre hath ouerlonge endured
bytwene Fraunce and Englande / and
ſurely who ſo euer it be that is or wyll be againſt
the peace ſhall derely aunſwere therto / 
outher quycke or deed. Howe knowe you that
quod the duke of Glouceſtre? Syr quod Robert / 
all that I ſay cometh by dyuyne inſpyracyon / 
and by a vyſione that came to me vpon
the ſee / as I retourned fro Baruch
                  •
                a porte in
Surey / beſyde the iſle of Rodes. Than he declared
all his hole vyſion / the rather therby to
moue the dukes herte to pytie and reaſon / but
this duke was herde herted agaynſt the peace
and kept ſtyll his opynion / and by his wordes
condempned and diſpyſed greatly the frenche
men / for all yt euer Robert the Hermyte coude
ſay. but bycauſe that this Robert was a ſtraū
               ger / 
and ſhewed by his wordes and werkes
that he wolde all were well / and alſo bycauſe
the duke ſawe that the kyng his nephue enclyned
to haue peace / he dyſſymuled and ſpake
fayre / what ſo euer his herte thought. Two
dayes this Robert taryed at plaſſhey with the
duke and had good chere / and the thyrde day
departed and retourned to London / and fro
thence to Wyndeſore / where the kynge made
hym good chere for loue that the frenche kyng
had ſent him thyder / and bycauſe he was wyſe
and eloquēt / and of ſwete wordes and honeſt.
It is nat to be doubted / but that the kynge demaūded
of hym howe he founde his vncle the
duke of Gloceſtre. And Robert anſwered him
well to the poynte. The kyng knewe well his
vncle of Glouceſtre enclyned rather to warre
than to peace / wherfore he fauoured moche
better his other two vncles dukes of Lancaſtre
and yorke. whan Robert the hermyte had
ben a moneth with the king he toke his leaue / 
and at his departynge the kynge gaue hym
great gyftes / and ſo dyd the dukes of Lancaſtre
and yorke / and the erles of Huntyngdon
and Salyſbury / and the lorde Thomas Percy.
The kynge cauſed hym to be conueyed to

Douer / and there paſſed ouer in to Fraunce / 
and he founde the frenche kyng and the quene
and his vncles at Paris / and there ſhewed the
kinge all his voyage / and what good chere he
had in Englande. Thus dayly meſſangers
went in & out bytwene theſe two kynges / and
amyable letters ſent bytwene them. the kynge
of Englande deſyred nothyng ſo moche as to
come to this maryage / and ſemblably the frenche
kynge had lyke deſyre / for he thought his
doughter ſhulde be a great eſtate if ſhe might
be quene of Englande.
         
         
            ¶Of the delyueraunce of the lorde
de la Ryuer and of ſyr Iohan le Mercyer / 
and howe they were put out of
priſone. Cap. CC.v.
            
               YE haue herde here before
howe ye lorde de la Ryuer and ſir
Iohan le Mercyer / were in ieoperdy
of their lyues / and remoued
fro priſon to priſon / & at laſte
delyuered to the prouoſt of the Chatelet of Parys / 
and were at the poynte to loſe their lyues
and all for hate & enuye that the dukes of Berrey
and Burgoyne and their counſayle had to
them. They were in this daunger more than
two yere. The kyng ſocoured thē / for always
he ſtopped the execuſion / and that the dukes of
Berrey & Burgoyne ſawe well / and alſo they
perceyued that the duke of Orlyaunce ayded
them as moche as he might / alſo the duches of
Berrey was a good meane for them / and ſpecially
for ye lorde de la Ryuer / and alſo the one
coulde nat be condempned without the other / 
for they were accuſed all for one cauſe. The
prayers of good folkes and their ryght togyther
ayded theym. Than it was regarded by
many of the high barones of Fraūce who had
pytie on them / and ſayd they had ſuffred priſonement
ouerlonge / and that it was tyme to
ſhewe them grace / for this Iohan le Mercyer
had ſo moche wept in priſon / yt his ſyght was
ſore decayed / ſo that he coude ſcant ſe / the brute
ranne through the realme that he was blynd.
Than at laſt they had ſentence gyuen them of
grace by the kynge / and there the lorde de la
Ryuer was reſtored agayne to all his landes
and caſtels / as ye fayre caſtell of Aniou / but he
was charged on payne of his lyfe that whan
he was ones in his caſtell of Aniowe / that he
ſhuld neuer after repaſſe the ryuer of Sayne
without he were cōmaunded by the kynges
owne mouthe. And ſyr Iohan le Mercyer to
retourne to Poūte de Nonnon / in to his fayre
houſe in Laonnoys / and he nat to repaſſe the
ryuer of Oyſe / of Marne / nor of Seyne / without
he were in lykewyſe called by the kynges
owne mouth. Thus they bounde them ſelfe to
take this priſonment / and thought they had a
great grace to ſcape ſo well / & were ryght ioyouſe
whan they were delyuered fro the Chatelet.
They truſted whan they came out of priſon / 
to haue ſpoken with ye kynge / and to haue
thanked hym of his grace / but they coulde nat
be ſuffred / but were cōmaunded to auoyde out
of Parys and to reſorte thyder as they were
cōmaūded. Thus they were delyuered wherof
their frendes had great ioy.
         
         
            ¶Of the peace that was hadde bytwene
the duke of Bretayne and ſir
Olyuer Clyſſon. Cap. CC.vi.
            yE haue herde howe the duke of Bretayne
and ſyr Olyuer of Cliſſon warred
longe togyther mortally / for bytwene
them they toke none to mercy / and ſurely
ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon and his partie bare
them ſo valyaūtly / that of thre he had twayne / 
for the lordes of Bretaygne dyſſimnied with
the duke / and men of the cyties and good townes
ſayde / howe they muſt nedes lyue and vſe
their marchaundyſe / what ſo euer warre was
bytwene the duke and ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon / 
for they ſayd it touched them nothinge / wherfore
they wolde nat entermed
                  •
               e bytwene them
but euer the Vycount of Rohan / the lorde de
Leo
                  •
                / and the lorde of Dignan / treated for a
peace to be had bytwene them. So moch they
purſewed that the duke promyſed to be entreated / 
ſo that the myght ſe ſyr Olyuer in his preſence / 
and ſpeke with him. and thervpon theſe
lordes on a day rode to a fortreſſe of ſyr Olyuers
to ſpeke with him / and there they ſhewed
him for what cauſe they we
                  •
                come thyder / and
howe they had got graūt of the duke to ſende
to him a ſafeconducte / ſafely to go and come to
ſpeke with hym / ſayeng yt ſurely they thought

if he were ones in his preſence / all the yuell
wyll and diſpleaſures ſhulde be clerely pardoned.
Than ſir Olyuer ſayd. Sirs / ye are
all my frendes and louers / and I truſt great
lye in you / and beleue that the duke hath promyſed
as you ſaye / and I thynke he wolde
gladly ſe me in his preſēce. But ſo good helpe
me and ſaynt yues / vpon his worde and promiſe
I enſure you / I wyll nat ones iſſue out
of my houſe. But I ſhall tell you what ye
ſhall ſaye to hym / that if he wyll haue me to
come to hym / let hym ſende hyder in pledge
his eldeſt ſonne / and whan he is here / than̄e
I wyll go and ſpeke with hym / & ſuche ende
as I ſhall make his ſonne ſhall make. yf I
retourne he ſhall do in lykewiſe / and if I abyde
he ſhall abide. Whan theſe lordes ſawe
they coude haue none other ende / they tooke
their leaue and retourned to Wannes where
the duke was / and ſhewed euery thynge as
they had herde. The duke coude haue none
other waye. This ſir Olyuer bare hym ſelfe
ſo valyauntly in this warre / that he wanne
more than he loſt. He toke two tymes all the
dukes veſſell and plate of golde and ſyluer / 
and dyuers other iewelles / wherof he hadde
great profyte.
            The concluſyon of the warre and hate bytwene
the duke of Bretayne and ſir Olyuer
Clyſſon / was thus. The duke of Bretayne
(lyke a great lorde as he was) ſawe well he
coude nat come to his entent of ſir Olyuer of
Clyſſon / and that he had ouer many frendes
in Bretayne / for ſauyng their alegiaūce to ye
duchy of Bretayne. All the bretons / knyghtes / 
ſquyers / prelates / and men of the good
Cyties and good townes / enclyned more to
the lorde Clyſſon than to the duke. And the
highe barons diſſymuled / and had aunſwered
the duke / that they wolde nat entremedle
them with that warre / but ſayde they wolde
gladly ſette a peace and accorde bytwene thē
Alſo the duke of Orlyaunce ſpecially conforted
couertly in many maner of wayes ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon / and he was alwayes ioyous
whan he herde of his good ſpede / in any
of his entreprices. The duke of Bretaygne
who was a ſubtyle prince and ymaginatyfe
and had endured moche payne duryng this
warre / and ſawe well he was nat very well
beloued with his owne people / as the chyldren
of the lorde Charles of Bretayne were / 
the one called Charles of Bloyes / who was
ſlayne at the batayle of Alroy / and Iohn̄ of
Bretayne erle of Ponthieur and of Lymogines / 
who had to wyfe the doughter of ſir Olyuer
of Cliſſon / and the lorde Henry of Bretayne
his brother / and their ſuſter the quene
of Naples and of Hieruſalem. Alſo the duke
ſawe that he began to waxe olde / & that his
chyldren were but yonge / and ꝑceyued well
he had no frendes in Fraūce / except the duke
of Burgoyne & the duches his wyfe. And he
ſawe well his chyldren ſhulde haue as fewe
for by their mothers ſyde / they came & were
iſſued of the membres and braunches of Nauer / 
whiche generacion was nat ouermoche
loued in Fraunce / for the great myſcheues yt
kynge Charles of Nauerre father to the ducheſſe
of Bretayne had done / in tyme paſt in
Fraunce / wherof the remembraunce as than
endured. And the duke ſawe that if he dyed
in that eſtate / bothe with ſir Olyuer of Cliſſon
and with the erle of Ponthieur / he than
douted that his chyldren that were ſo yonge
ſhulde haue ouer many great enemyes. and
alſo he ſawe that the alyaunce bytwene hym
and Englande began to waxe colde / For he
was enformed that the kynge of Englande
ſhulde haue to wyfe the doughter of Fraūce
theſame lady that was promyſed to hym for
his ſonne and heyre. The duke dyde caſt all
theſe doutes. Than̄e all thynges conſydered / 
he ymagined to breke his herte without
diſſimulacion / and make a ferme peace with
ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon & with Iohan of Bretayne:
And wolde putte hym ſelfe at their
pleaſure / to make amendes for all wrathes / 
forfaytes / and dōmages / that euer they dyde
to hym or to his men / duryng the warre. He
wolde deſyre nothynge but that they ſhulde
take hym for duke of Bretayne / and his children
after hym / accordyng to the artycles of
the peace before made / bytwene hym and the
chyldren of ſir Charles of Bloyes / whiche
charter of peace he wolde nat breke nor any
artycle compriſed therin. And alſo to kepe
and vpholde euery thyng that he had promyſed
to Iohn̄ of Bloyes his coſyn / erle of Pō-Ponthieur.
And if he hadde nat his parte of
the herytage of Bretayne ſuffycient / he wolde
putte the ordring therof without any diſſymulacion
to the vicount of Rohan / and to

the lordes of Dignan / of Leon / of Lauall / 
and of Beaumont / and of the lorde Iohn̄ of
Harpeden. Whan the duke of Bretayne had
aduyſed in hym ſelfe all this purpoſe / without
makynge of any man of his counſayle / 
He called to hym his ſecratorie and in a chabre
they two alone / he cauſed hym to write a
letter to ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / as ſwetely &
amiably as coude be deuyſed / deſyring hym
that they might ſpeke toguyder ſecretely / on
truſt to haue good peace bytwene thē. Whan
this Letter was made / deuyſed / and ſealed / 
Than he toke a ſecrete perſon / cōmaundyng
hym to go to the caſtell of Ioſſelyn / and ſaye
I do ſende the to ſpeke with my coſyn ſir Olyuer
of Clyſſon / and ſalute hym fro me and
delyuer hym this letter and bring agayne an
anſwere. And on payne of thy ly
                  •
               e kepe this
ſecrete / and ſhewe no creature whider thou
goſt / nor who dothe ſende the. He tooke his
iourney and ſpedde hym ſo well / that he cāe
to the caſtell Ioſſelyn. The porters had marueyle
whan they herde hym ſaye that he cae
fro the duke of ſpeke with their maiſter. they
wente and ſhewed their lorde therof. Than
he cōmaunded that the meſſanger ſhulde cōe
to hym / and ſo he dyde. And well and wiſely
declared his meſſage / and delyuered his letter
ſealed with the dukes ſeale / whiche ſir Olyuer
knewe ryght well / and opyned & reed
the letter two or thre tymes / the better to vnderſtande
it. And in the redyng he had great
marueyle of the ſwete wordes / cretable / and
amyable / that was compriſed in the letter.
He ſtudyed a ſeaſon / and at laſt ſayd / howe
he wolde take aduyſe and write agayne. ſir
Olyuers men hadde great marueyle of this / 
for before he had forborne no man of the dukes / 
but outher he was ſlayne or putte in priſone.
Than̄e ſir Olyuer wente in to his lecrete
chambre / and began to muſe and ymagyn
vpon theſe newes: At laſt he apeſed his
yuell wyll / in that ye duke humyled hymſelfe
ſo moche towardes him / and that he wrote ſo
ſwetely. yet he thought in hym ſelfe to proue
the duke further / or he aduentured hym ſelfe
to go to the duke / for he thought if he toke any
hurte / no man wolde bewayle hym / if he
loſt hym ſelfe by folly. Than he wrote a letter
to the duke ryght ſwete and tretable / but
the concluſyon was / that yf he wolde haue
hym to come & ſpeke with hym / that he ſhuld
ſende his ſon̄e and heyre to lye in hoſtage for
hym / tyll his retourne. This letter was delyuered
to the dukes varlet / who retourned
therwith to Wannes where the duke was / &
there delyuered his letter. The duke reed it / 
and ſtudyed a lytell and ſayd. I ſhall do it / 
to the entence to treate louyngly with hym.
Than thē duke wrote a letter to the vycount
of Rohan / who was at the caſtell of Cayre / 
Whan the vycount ſawe the dukes letter / he
came incontynent to Wannes. Than the duke
ſhewed all his purpoſe and entencyon. &
ſayd Vycount / you and the lorde of Mountburſier
ſhall leade my ſon̄e to the caſtell Ioſſelyn
and leaue hym there / and bringe with
you the lorde Olyuer Clyſſon / for I wyll agree
and make peace with hym. The vicoūt
ſayd it ſhulde be done gladly. So they toke
the dukes ſonne and heyre / who was about
the age of eight yere / and ledde hym to ye caſtell
Ioſſelyn / to the lorde Olyuer Clyſſon / 
who receyued them ryght honorably. And
whan he ſawe the chylde and the good affection
of the duke / he humyled and apeſed his
herte greatlye: and with that the knyghtes
tolde hym and ſayd. ſir / ye ſe the good wyll
of the duke / he hath ſpoken nothyng but his
hert dothe agre to the ſame. I ſe it well quod
ſir Olyuer / and for that I ſe and ꝑceyue his
good wyll / I ſhall put me ſo farforthe / that
I ſhall yelde me vnder his obeyſaunce. And
it ſemeth ye be ryght nere to hym / ſeynge he
putteth his affiaunce and truſt in you / to delyuer
you his heyre to bringe to me to lye in
hoſtage / tyll I be retourned. I wotte nat / if
he haue ſhewed you what he hath written to
me / ſygned and ſealed with his ſeale. The
lordes anſwered and ſaid. Sir / he hath well
tolde vs / that he hath ryght great deſyre to
come to a peace and accorde with you. In
this ye maye right well beleue vs / we be of
your blode. Than̄e ſir Olyuer went for the
letters that the duke had ſent hym / and reed
them. Sir quod they / all that is conteyned
in this letter he hath ſaid vnto vs / and vpon
the ſame eſtate he hath ſent vs hyder. Than
ſir Olyuer ordaygned hym to departe with
the ſayd lordes / and toke the dukes ſonne agayne
with them and ſaid / howe they ſhulde
bringe agayne the chylde to his father / ſayeng
that he truſted right well his ꝓmyſe / cō
               ſydring
that he had proued hym ſo farre / and

that he had ſhewed ſuche humilyte: He douted
nat but that his herte was in vnyte. So
they came to Wannes. The duke had apoynted
that ſir Olyuer ſhulde tary at a Freres
without the towne of Wannes / and there the
duke ſhulde come and ſpeke with hym: as it
was ordayned ſo it was done. and whan the
duke ſawe that ſir Olyuer had brought agayne
his ſonne and heyre / he reputed if for a
great curteſy / and was well content therwt.
Thus the duke and ſir Olyuer mette in the
Freres / and there they two alone entred in
to a chambre / and cōmuned toguyder a ſeaſon / 
and after iſſued out through a gardeyn
and came to the ryuer ſyde / and there they entred
in to a bote / and fro thens entred in to a
ſhyppe that laye at ancre. And ſo whan they
were farre of fro all people / they cōmuned a
longe ſeaſon toguyder. What their wordes
were I knowe nat / but their dealynge was
as I ſhall ſhewe you.
            THeir men had went they hadde been
ſtyll in the Freres / but as it was ſhewed
me / they were thus in the ſhyppe more
than two houres / & there made a good peace
bytwene them / and ſware faythe and trouth
eche to other without diſſymulacyon. Than
they called agayne ye boteman / & he brought
them agayne where he had them / and ſo entred
agayne by the gardeyne ſyde in to the
Freres. Than anone after the duke cāe out
and ledde ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon by ye hande
and ſo went in to the towne of Wannes / and
in to the caſtell called le Mote. Of this peace
euery man was greatly reioyſed / and to ſe
them ſo amiably togyder / and ſo was all the
countrey. At the makyng of this peace Iohn̄
of Bloyes erle of Ponthieur loſt nat / for his
reuenewes was therby augmented of twētie
thouſande crownes of golde by yere for euer
to hym and to his heyres. And at this peace
a maryage was ordayned for ye duke of Bretaynes
doughters / to confyrme the better the
loue and alyaunces bytwene them / great newes
ran through Fraunce and Englande of
this peace.
            ye haue herde here before / howe ſir Peter
of Craon fell in the frenche kynges diſpleaſure
and of the duke of Orlyaunce / bycauſe
of ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon / in that he wolde haue
ſlayne hym on a nyght as he went to his
houſe warde: & howe the duke of Bretayne
ſuſteyned hym in his houſe / by whiche occaſyon
the frēche kyng wolde haue made warr̄
agaynſt the duke / if the ſickeneſſe that tooke
hym had nat been / by whiche incydentes the
kynges army brake vp. & alſo ye haue herde
howe the dukes of Berrey and Burgoyne
bare great diſpleaſure / to all ſuche as counſayled
the kyng therto: As ſir Olyuer of clyſſon / 
the lorde de la Ryuer / the lorde Iohan le
Mercyer / Montague and other / who afterwarde
endured therby great priſonment: &
howe the two dukes had the gouernaūce of
the realme / as long as the kynge was in his
ſickeneſſe. alſo it hath ben ſhewed what mortall
warre was bytwene the duke of Bretaygne
and ſir Olyuer of Clyſſon: & alſo howe
the lordes de la Ryuer / ſir Iohan Mercyer / 
and Montague were delyuered out of priſone / 
whiche Montague had nat ſo moche
trouble as the other had / for as ſoone as the
kyng was returned to his helth / he toke Mō
               tague
agayne about hym & made his excuſe.
So by reaſon of theſe ſōdrie ſickeneſſes that
the kyng had dyuers tymes / gretly troubled
the realme of Fraūce / and moche abated the
kynges puiſſaunce / ſo that he had nat euery
thyng done accordyuge to his wyll. In this
ſeaſon ſir Peter of Craon was nothyng diſpleaſed
with the kynges ſickeneſſe / nor with

the kyng of Hūgry in his letters / prayed the
Frenche kyng to entende to ayde and ſocour

ſhulde nat be violated by him / and
that his pride and boſt myght be abated. In
theſe letters were conteygned many wordes
of great loue / as kynges & coſyns write eche

ſente by ſuffycient perſonages / who dyde ſo
moche / that the Frenche kynge enclyned his
hert therto / and was the gladder to ſette forwarde
the treatie of ye mariage of his doughter / 
to the kynge of Englande. Than anone
theſe newes of Hungry were publyſſhed abrode / 
and written in to many countreis / to
moue the hertes of gentylmen / knightes and
ſquiers / ſuche as wolde auaunce them to get
honour. The ſame ſeaſon that theſe newes
were brought to the kyng / there was at Parys
the duke of Burgoyne and the ducheſſe / 
and Iohan of Burgoyne their ſonne & heyre
erle of Neuers / who as than was no knyght
and the lorde Guye of Tremoyle & the lorde
Wyllyam his brother / and many lordes and
other of the realme of Fraunce. Than the duke
of Burgoyne enclyned ſore to this viage / 
and ſpecially that his ſon̄e ſhulde enterprice
the ſayd voyage / ſo he myght be chefe heed &
leader of the army / that ſhulde go in that viage.
This Iohan of Burgoyne was but a
yonge man / of the age of .xxii. yeres / Wyſe / 
curteſſe / tretable / humble / and welbeloued of
knyghtes and ſquyers of Burgone / and of

to wyfe the doughter of duke Aubert of Bauier / 
erle of Heynalte / Hollande / and zelāde /

chyldren full lykely to come to great maryages.
One ſhewed this Iohan of Burgoyne
howe the Frenche kyng wolde ſende hym in
this voyage in to Hungry / to ſe what he wolde
ſaye. Than he ſayd / if it pleace the kynge
and the duke my father to ſende me as chiefe

for I haue great deſyre to auaunce my ſelfe.
well ſir quod they / ye were beſt to ſpeke with
the duke youre father that he maye ſpeke to
the kynge / for without his good wyll ye can
do nothynge.
            IT was nat long after / but that this Iohan
of Burgoyne ſpake to his father / 
prayeng hym humbly to conſent yt he myght

go in this voyage in to Hungry / and at the
ſame tyme there was by hym ſir Guye and
ſir Wyllyam of Tremoyle / and other / & they
ſaid to the duke. Sir / this requeſt that your
ſonne maketh is but reſonable / for it is tyme

he can nat take it / than in goyng the iourney
agaynſt the enemyes of holy Churche.
And it the kynge wyll ſende any perſonage
in that voyage / he can nat ſende a more honorable
man / than̄e his owne coſyn germayne
your ſonne: and ye ſhall ſe many knyghtes
go with hym / as well for their owne auaūcementes
as for your loue. Than the duke ſaid
well / ſo be it. I ſhall nat lette the good wyll
of my ſonne / I ſhall ſpeke to the kyng therin / 
and ſhall ſe what anſwere he wyll make.
And anone after the duke ſpake to the kynge
therin / and the kynge incontynent enclyned
therto and ſayd / howe it ſhulde be well done
that he went / and we wyll that he ſhall go / 
and we wyll make hym as chefe of that iourney.
Than ye tidyngꝭ was ſhewed throughe
all Parys and without / that Iohan of Burgoyne
with a great company of knyghtes / 
ſhulde go in to Hungry to ſe the puyſſaunce
of the great Turke. and that iourney atchyued / 
thanne the Chriſten men to go to Conſtātyne

or ſaynt George / and ſo to entre in to Surrey / 
and to delyuer Hieruſalem out of the panyms
handes. Than awaked ſuche knyghtes
and ſquyers as deſyred aduauncement.
Whan the duke of Burgoyne ſawe that his
ſonne ſhulde go in this voyage / and that he
ſhulde be chiefe of the army / he honored than
the more the ambaſſadours of Hungry / who
whan they ſawe the kynges good wyll / the
dukes & the Frenchmens / they were gladde / 
and toke their leaue of the kynge and of the
other lordes of Fraunce / and ſo retourned to
their countrey / and made relacyon to ye kyng
of Hungry howe they had ſpedde / wherwith
the kynge was greatly reioyſed / and made
great prouiſyon agaynſt the cōmynge of the
Frenche men / and ſent theſe ambaſſadours
to his brother the kyng of Almaigne to open
his paſſages / and alſo to his coſyn the duke
of Auſtriche / for throughe the ſtraytes of Auſtryche
he muſte nedes paſſe: And by all the
wayes he cauſed great prouiſyon of vitayle
to be ordayned. And alſo he wrote letters to
the great mayſter of Pruce / and to the Rhodes.
Certifyeng them of the cōmyng of Iohan
of Burgoyne / with a thouſande knyghtes
and ſquiers of valyant men / to the entent
to entre in to Turkey / and to reſyſt the great
boſt of kyng Baſant / called the great turke.
            IN this ſeaſon the lorde Coucy was
come to Parys / and was but newlye
retourned fro a voyage / where
he hadde ben a hole yere / whiche was on the
fronters of Gēnes. And there were certayne
great men genowayes / that had enformed ye
duke of Orlyaunce / that the hoole Duchy of
Geane / deſyred to haue to their chiefe lorde
ſome noble perſone / diſcended of the lynage
of the flour delyce. And for as moche as the
duke of Orlyaunce had wedded the doughter
of the lorde of Myllaygne / and that the
lande and duchy of Geane ſhulde be ryght
mete for hym / at the duke of Orlyaunce inſtaunce / 
the lorde of Coucy with thre hūdred
ſpeares and fyue hūdred croſ bowes / paſſed
ouer in to Sauoye and to Pyemont / by the
accorde and conſent of the erle of Sauoye / 
and came in to Aſte in Pyemont by the conſent
of the lorde of Myllayne / and came to a
cytie called Alexandria / and ſo came to the
fronters & marcheſſe of the genowayes / and
there fell in treatie with them to know more
playnly their entēcyons / for ꝑforce he coulde
do nothyng / without he had had greatier puiſſaunce
than he had. And whan the lorde of
Coucy came firſt vpon the fronters of the ryuer
of Geane / where the entrees are ſtronge
to conquere: if there be made any defence.
Some lordes of the genowayes ſuche as fauoured
the lorde Coucy / and had enformed
the duke of Orlyaunce / wherby he ſente thyder
the lorde of Coucy. They entreated him
amiably and brought hym to their coūtreis / 
and offred to hym their caſtels. The lorde of
Coucy who was ſage / ſubtyle / and ymaginatyfe / 
and knewe right well the nature of the
lombardes and genowayes / wolde nat truſt
them ouermoche / nor haue to great confydence
in their offers and promyſes / but alwayes
wyſely he helde them in loue and amyte / 
as longe as he was amonge them / and ledde
them forthe with fayre wordes and treaties.
They had many cōmunycacyons in the felde
toguyder / but neuer in no fortreſſe / and euer

the more he comuned with theym / the leſſe he
conquered or gate. the genouoys made to him
ſygne of loue and promyſed hym many thynges / 
and wolde haue had hym to haue gone
in to the cytie of Gennes or to Porte Vender / 
but the lorde of Coucy durſt neuer aſſure hym
in their offers. The concluſyon of his voyage
was ſuche that he gate nothynge / and whan
he ſawe that he coulde nat atcheue his buſyneſſe / 
he ſignyfied his eſtate to the duke of Orlyance / 
whervpon he was remaunded and ſo
he retourned to Parys / and came thyder the
ſame ſeaſon that all the buſyneſſe was for the
iourney goynge in to Hungery. The duke of
Burgoyne reioyſed greatly of his retourne / 
and he and ducheſſe ſente for hym to their
houſe of Arthoyſe in ſygne of great loue / than
they ſayd to him. Syr we truſt moche in you / 
we haue cauſed Iohan our ſonne and heyre to
take on hym an enterpriſe in ye honour of god
and of all chriſtendome / and we knowe well
that aboue all other knyghtes of Fraunce / ye
are the moſte vſed and expert in all thynges / 
wherfore derely we requyre you that ye wolde
be companion with our ſonne in this voyage / 
and his chyefe counſaylour / wherof / we ſhall
thanke you / and deſerue it to you and yours.
Than the lorde of Coucy ſaid / my lorde & you
madame / your wordes and requeſtes ought
to be to me a cōmaundement / in this voyage
I ſhall go if it pleaſe god for two cauſes. Firſt
for deuocyon to defende the faythe of Iheſu
Chriſt. Secondly in that ye do to me ſomoche
honour / as to gyue me charge of my lorde Iohan
your ſonne / and I ſhall acquyte me truely
to him to my power / howe be it of this dede ye
may well dyſcharge me / and to charge ſpecyally
his coſyn and nere kyneſman / my lorde
Phylyppe of Arthoys erle of Ewe and conſtable
of Fraunce / and his other coſyn the erle of
Marche / bothe two ought / to go with hym in
this voyage for they be both nere of his blode.
Than the duke ſayd. My lorde of Coucy / ye
haue moche more ſene than theſe other twayn
haue and knowe better the orderynge of an
army in ſtraunge countreys / than outher our
coſyn of Ewe or of March / therfore we charge
you and praye you to execute our requeſtes.
Than he aunſwered and ſayd my lorde / your
prayer is to me a cōmaundement / and I ſhall
do it / ſythe it pleaſeth you / with the ayde and
helpe of my lorde Guye of Tremoyle and of
my lorde Guillyam his brother / and of the admyrall
of Fraunce. Of this anſwere the duke
and ducheſſe had great ioye.
            THeſe lordes prepared them ſelues to
go in this iourney into Hūgery / and
lordes / knyghtes / and ſquyers were
deſyred to go in their company / and many deſyred
themſelfe to go. Some were retaygned / 
and ſome went without mayſters / and ſome
conſyderynge the voyage in to Hungery / and
fro thence in to Turkey to be ouer longe / and
chargeable for them / beynge nat retaygned / 
waxed colde in their enterpryſe. For the ſettynge
forwarde of this yonge Iohan of Burgoyne / 
nothynge was ſpared / horſe / harneſſe / 
freſſhe clothes / riche veſſell / and plate of golde
and ſyluer / and offycers apoynted to do their
atendaūce / and money delyuered and werke / 
men payed. Than all barones / knightes / and
ſquiers / for the honour of Iohn̄ of Burgoyne
and alſo for the auauncement of their bodies / 
enforced them to make them redy. The lorde
Phylyppe of Arthoys ordeyned hym ſo puyſſauntly
that nothynge was ſpared / and wolde
go in that voyage as Conſtable of Fraunce.
And the frenche kynge who loued him entierlye / 
helped hym moche towarde his charges / 
and ſo he dyd to the lorde Boucyquant marſhall
of Fraunce. The duke of Burgoyne conſydered
that this voyage of his ſonnes ſhulde
coſte ouermoche fynaunce / and he thought it
conuenyent that the ſtate of his ſonne ſhulde
be mayntayned / and to fynde ſyluer to mayntayne
it withall / he foūde out ſubtelly a backe
tayle / for by a former tayle all the countreys / 
cyties / and fortreſſes had ben tayled. And the
ſaid backe tayle mounted in Burgoyne of the
chyuallry / ſyxe hundred thouſande crownes
of golde. And agayne / the duke made it to be
tolde to all knyghtes and ladyes that helde of
him in fee / yonge and olde / that they ſhulde go
in to Hungery in their owne propre perſones
with his ſonne / or els to paye a taxe of ſyluer.
ſo they were taxed ſome at a thouſande poūde
the other at fyue hundred frankes / & eche man
after his goodes and valure of his landes. Ladyes
and auncyent knyghtes remembringe
the traueyle of their bodyes / and were nat ſhapen
nor made to endure ſuche payne / conpoū
               ded
and payed at the wyll of the Duke. The
yonge knyghtes and ſquyers were forborne

payeng of any money. but it was ſaid to them
that they ſhulde go with the lorde Iohan / at
their owne coſte and charge / and otherwyſe
nat. Of this backe tayle the duke reyſed .lx.
thouſāde crownes / and ſo none was forborne.
            THe tydynges of this voyage ſpredde
abrode / and whan it came in to the
countrey of Haynalt / knyghtes and
ſquyers / ſuche as deſyred auauncement ſpake
togyther and ſayde. A this were a mete voyage
for my lorde of Oſtrenant / who is yonge
and for his brother the erle of Neuers / and if
any of them wente we myght well go in their
company. The erle of Oſtrenant beynge at
that tyme at Queſnoy / vnderſtode what the
knyghtes and ſquyers of his countrey ſayde / 
and he thought no leſſe thā they dyd / and had
great affectyon to go in this voyage. & whan
he herde any ſpekyng of that mater / he wolde
anſwere but lytell / but dyſſymuled the mater / 
but he was in good entencyon to ſpeke with
duke Aubert of Bauyer erle of Haynalt / and
to do as he wolde counſayle hym. Within a
whyle after the Erle of Oſtrenant came in to
Hay in Holande / where his father was with
the ducheſſe his wyfe. Than he ſayd to his father.
my lorde / ſuche tydinges rynneth abrode
that my fayre brother of Neuers hathe enterpriſed
this ſōmer to go into Hungery / and fro
thens in to Turkey / whereby all lykelyhode
great dedes of armes ſhall be atchyued. and
ſyr / as at this tyme I wotte nat where better
to enploye myſelfe in any dede of armes / wherin
I wolde gladly knowe youre pleaſure. I
wolde go in that honourable voyage with a
hundred knyghtes / and beare company with
my fayre brother / the duke of Burgoyne and
my lady the duches ſhall can me gret thanke / 
and many knyghtes and ſquyers of Haynalt
wyll gladly holde me company. Than duke
Aubert / as a man redy purueyed of aunſwere
ſayd. Guylliam / what haſte or wyll haue you
to go in this voyage in to Hungery and in to
Turkey / to ſeke armes vpon people and countrey
that neuer dyd vs any forfeyte / thou haſt
no tytell of reaſon to go / but for the vayneglory
of the worlde. Lette Iohan of Burgoyne
and our coſins of Fraunce do their enterpriſe / 
and do thy dedes aparte / & go thou in to Freſe
and conquere our herytage that theſe freſones
by pride and rudenes do witholde fro vs / and
wyll come to none obeyſaunte / and to do this
I ſhall ayde the. The wordes of the father to
the ſonne lyghtened greatly the herte of therle
of Oſtrenant / who aunſwered and ſayd. My
lorde ye ſaye well / and if it pleaſe you that I
ſhall do that voyage / I ſhall do it with ryght
a good wyll.

               THeſe wordꝭ bytwene
the father & the ſonne multyplyed
ſo moche lytell and
lytell / that the voyage in to
Freſe was taken and enter
priſed / and one thynge helped
moche the matter forwarde / 
and that was. The erle of Oſtrenant
had at that tyme aboute hym and nere of his
counſayle a ſquyer of Haynalte / called Ferebraſe / 
otherwiſe called the baſtarde Vertayne
a wyſe man and a ſubtyll in feates of armes / 
ſo that whan he herd of this he ſaid to the erle.
Syr my lorde your father ſpeketh well / it is
better for your honour that ye / make this voyage
rather than in to Hungery / and ordayne
you therto / and ye ſhall fynde knyghtes and
ſquyers of Haynalt and elſwhere that wyll be
gladde to kepe you company / and ſhall ayde
you to their powers to do this enterpriſe. and
if ye haue mynde thus to do / I wyll counſayle
you to go in to Englāde / and to ſignyfy your
enterpriſe to the knyghtes and ſquyers there / 
and pray the kynge of Englande your coſyn / 
that he wyll gyue lycence to knyghtes / ſquyers / 
and archers to go with you in to Freſe / at
your wages / englyſſe men be men of dedes / 
and if ye haue them ye ſhall do your buſineſſe
the better. And if ye may haue by prayer your
coſyn therle of Derby in your company / your
voyage ſhall be moche the fayrer / and your enterpriſe
the more renomed. The erle enclyned
to thoſe wordes / for it ſemed to hym that his
counſayle was good. In lykewyſe the lorde
Gomegynes gaue hym counſayle / and ſo dyd
dyuers other. Theſe wordes anone ſpredde abrode

in Haynalte. Than there was acommaundement
made to all knyghtes and ſquiers
in Heynalt / that none of theym ſhulde go
out of the coūtrey / to go in to Hungrey nor in
to no place els / bycauſe the erle of Oſtrenant
ſhulde ocupy them another waye / and ſhulde
leade them in to Freſe. We ſhall leaue ſpeakynge
of this buſyneſſe / and retourne to the
voyage in to Hungery.
            THus knyghtes and ſquiers in many
parties had cauſe to awake / and to
take corage / for ye warres that were
towarde in that ſeaſon / as well for the voyage
in to Hungery as in to Freſe. The erle of Neuers
auaunced his iourney / and all knyghtes
and Squyers were named and written that
ſhulde go with him / prouiſion was great and
well ordeyned / and for that he wolde be renomed
in this voyage he was lyberall and mad
great larges to many knyghtes and ſquyers
that ſhulde go in his bande / for the voyage
was long and coſtely / wherfore it was nedefull
for thē to haue ſome ayde towardes their
charges / and the other lordes as the conſtable
of Fraūce / and the erles of Ewe and Marche / 
the lordes Henry and Phylippe of Bare / the
lorde of Coucy / the lorde Guy of Tremoyle /

were to the nombre of a thouſande knyghtes
and a thouſande ſquyers / & all valyaunt men.
Euery man departed fro their owne houſes about
the myddes of marche / and ſo rode forth
by companyes / and alwayes they founde the
wayes open / for the kynge of Almayne had
cōmaūded through all his realme of Almayne
and Boeſme / that they ſhulde haue all thynges
neceſſary / and that no vytayle ſhulde be

thus rode forwarde / to the ayde of the kyng of
Hungery / who ſhulde haue batayle with the
great turke / puyſſaunce agaynſt puyſſaunce / 
the twenty day of the moneth of May. Theſe
lordes paſſed Lorayne: the countie of Bare / 
the countie of Mountbelyart / and the duchy

                  •••
                many

in to Auſtriche / whiche is a great coūtrey
and the entres and iſſues ſtronge / and great
deſertes. but they went with ſo good wyll and
corage / that payne and traueyle greued them
nothyng. The duke of Auſtriche made capytaynes
in his countrey / ſuche as made the lordes
good chere / and ſpecyally to Iohn̄ of Burgoyne / 
who was chiefe of that army. All theſe
lordes were apoynted to aſſemble in a cytie in
Hungery called Bode. ¶Nowe let vs ſpeke
of other maters.
            yE haue herde here before / howe the
kynge of England had ſente in the

whiche ambaſſadours were / the archebyſſhop

the lorde Beamonde / the lorde Spenſer and
many other. the frenche kyng had made them
good chere / and all his vncles and counſayls / 
whiche ambaſſade were retourned in to Englande
vpon good hope to atayne to their deſyres.
The kynge of Englande for his parte

the frenche kynge / conſernynge the ſayd maters / 
who was well enclyned to haue peace / 
and to haue ende of the warre / whiche had ouer
longe endured. Theſe purſutes and treaties
toke ſuche effect / and the two kynges had
writen ſo ſolemply eche to other / that their maters
drewe nere to apoynte / ſo that ſuche ambaſſadours
as were fyrſt ſent out of Englande
in to Fraunce / were than ſente agayne and
came to Parys / and were lodged at the croſſe
of Tyroner / and their men in the ſtreat there

Thus they ſoiourned at Parys more

was coūteſſe of Rouſſey / ſomtyme wyfe to the
lorde Loys of Namure / but afterwarde ſhe
was deuorſed fro hym for a reaſonable cauſe / 
as it was ſayde. The ſeconde ſute this quene
had was agaynſt ſyr Peter of Craon / ſhe demaunded
of hym the ſōme of a hundred thouſande
frankes / whiche ſhe was redy to proue
that he had receyued it in the name of his lord
and mayſter / Loys kyng of Napoles / Cyſyll / 
and Iheruſalem her huſbande / whiche money
was delyuered hym to haue payed in to Powell / 
and or it was payed he herde howe his
ſayd mayſter my huſbande was deed. Than
he iourneyed no further / but returned agayne
in to Fraunce / and kept ſtyll the ſayd ſōme of
money to his owne profyte / and neuer made
acompte to the ſayde quene therof / nor to her
chyldren Loys and Charles / but ſpente and
waſted the money in pride and bobbans. The
quene layde to his charge that for faute of payment
of the ſayd money / the realme of Napoles
was loſte and conquered by Margarete
of Duras / and by the heyres of the lorde Charles
de la Paix / by reaſon that ſuche ſoudyours
as her huſbande had to mayntayne his warres
in Puell & Calabre / were nat payed their
wages / wherby many tourned to the Erle of
ſaynt Seuyre and to Margarete of Duras / 
and other departed and lefte the warres. All
theſe cauſes were put in to the Parlyament
chambre at Parys / where all cauſes were prepoſed / 
ſhewed and demaunded / and all the defences
and aunſweres herde on all partyes.
Their plee had endured the ſpace of thre yeres.
And though ſyr Peter of Craon were abſent
fro the parlyament / yet his aduocates defended
his cauſe / and ſayd though he had recyued
the ſayd ſōme in the name of his lorde
and mayſter / yet his mayſter was as moche
bounde to him as that ſōme came to and more
for the good ſeruyce that he had done to him.
This plee had endured ſo longe that it was
neceſſary to haue a concluſyon / and the lady
made importunate ſewte to haue iudgement.
The lordes of the parlyament conſydred all
thynges / and ſayd they wolde gyue no iudgement / 
without both parties were preſent / and
ſyr Peter of Craon durſte nat well apere in
Parys / bycauſe of the Kynges dyſpleaſure / 
and the duke of Orlyance / for the offence that
he had doone to ſyr Olyuer of Clyſſon conſtable
of Fraunce / and without he were preſent / 
they wolde gyue no ſentence defynityue / wher
vpon the ſayd lady purſewed to ſet hym clere
in Fraunce / and by her meanes he was pardoned / 
ſo that he myght ryde and go where he
lyſt without any daunger / except the ſute that
was bytwene her and hym for the ſayd ſōme
of money. So he was clerely dyſcharged of
all other charges / and lordes & ladyes made
hym good chere / I wote nat whether it were
by diſſymulacyon or otherwyſe. thus he was
agayne at Parys / holdynge as great eſtate
as euer he dyd. The ſame tyme he was apoynted
to be one of theym to receyue and bringe
the englyſſhe ambaſſadours to the kynge / for
he was a knyght that hadde ſene moche / and
knewe moche honoure. Than the daye was
prefyxed that the iudgement concernynge the
quenes maters ſhulde be determyned / at whiche
day there were preſent in the parlyament / 
great nombre of the lordes of Fraunce / to the
entent that the maters ſhulde be the more autentyke.
There was the quene of Cicyll and
Iheruſalem / and her ſonne Charles prince of
Thaurent / and Iohan of Bloys / called Iohan
of Bretaygne erle of Ponthyeure and of
Lymogynes / and the dukes of Orlyaunce / 
Berrey / Burgoyne / and Burhone / and the
erle of Brayne / and the byſſhoppe of Laon.
And before theym the lady was herde to laye
her tytell for the countie of Rouſſey. And on
the other parte there was ſyr Peter of Craon
and many of his lygnage. Fyrſte iudgement
was gyuen for the countye of Rouſſey / and
that was / the herytage was remyſſed and iudged
in to the handes and poſſeſſyon of the erle
of Brayne / and to the heyres that ſhulde dyſcende
of the ryght braunche of Rouſſey / reſerued
that the quene ſhulde haue agayne repayed
to her all the money that kynge Loys

her huſbande hadde payed to the counteſſe of
Rouſſey laſte deed. Of this iudgement the enherytours
of the countie of Rouſſey / to whom
the herytage pertayned thanked greatly the
lordes of the parliament. Than ſuche as were
ordayned to gyue the ſeconde ſentence aroſe
vp and ſayde howe that by the ſentence of the
parlyament / ſir Peter of Craon ought to pay
to the quene of Napoles ducheſſe of Aniowe
the ſomme of a hundred thouſande frankes in
redy money / or els his body to go to pryſone
tyll ſhe were contented and ſatyſfyed. Of this
iudgement the ſayde lady thanked the lordes
of the parlyament
                  •
                and in contynent at the cō
               playnte
of the lady / handes was layde on him
by the kynges commaundement / and ſo was
ledde to the caſtell of Loure / and there ſurely
kepte. So the lordes departed fro the parlyament.
Thus theſe two iudgementes were gyuen
by the princypall occaſyon of this lady / 
ducheſſe of Aniou.

            ¶Of the concluſyon of the maryage

                  •
               aken at Parys bytwene the kynge
of Englande & Iſabell eldeſt doughter
to the frenche kynge / and howe
the duke of Lancaſtre remaryed.
Cap. CC.x.
            
               THe ambaſſadours of
Englande / were with the
frenche kynge at Parys a
xxii. dayes and they had
as good chere as coulde be
deuyſed / and their maters
tooke ſuche effecte / that it
was agreed that the kyng of Englande ſhuld
haue in maryage Iſabell the eldeſt doughter
of kynge Charles / and by vertue of procuracyon / 
the erle Marſhall fyaunced and eſpouſed
her in the name of the kinge of Englande / 
and ſo ſhe was called fro thens forthe quene of
Englande. And as I was enfourmed it was
a goddly ſyght to ſe her behauour / for all that
ſhe was but yonge ryght pleſauntly ſhe bare
the porte of a quene▪ Than all this mater concluded / 
the englyſſhe men tooke their leaue of
the frenche kynge and of the quene / and of
their doughter quene of Englande / and of all
other lordes / and ſo departed fro Parys and
retourned to Calays / and ſo in to Englande.
The Kynge and other of his opynyon were
glad of their retourne. But who ſo euer was
gladde of that maryage / the duke of Glouceſtre
vncle to the kynge made no ioye there of / 
for he ſawe well that by reaſone of that maryage
and alyaunce / peace ſhulde be bytwene
the kinges and their realmes / whiche greued
hym / without it ſhulde be greatly to the honour
of the kynge and the realme of Englande / 
and that the Englyſſhe men myght be in
the ſame caſe or better in the parties of Gaſcoyne / 
as they were or the warres renewed agayne.
And of this matter he wolde often tymes
ſpeke with his brother the duke of yorke
and drewe hym as moche as he coulde to his
opynions / for he was but a ſofte prince / but to
the Duke of Lancaſtre his eldeſt brother he
durſte nat ſpeke ouer largely / for he ſawe well
he was of the kynges opynion / and was well
pleaſed with the Kynges maryage / princypally
for the loue of his two doughters / the
quene of Spaygne and the quene of Portugale.
The ſame ſeaſon the duke of Lancaſtre
remaryed agayne the thyrde tyme / to a lady
doughter to knyght in Haynalte / called ſyr
Paon of Ruette / he had ben in his tyme with
noble quene Phylyp of Englande / who was
of the nacyon of Haynalt ſhe was called Katheryn / 
and was brought vp in her youthe in
the duke of Lancaſters howſe / with the ducheſſe
Blaunce of Lancaſtre / And after the
dethe of this lady Blaunce / the duke maryed
the lady Cuſtaunce of Spaygne / and in her
dayes the duke kepte to his concubyne this lady
Katheryne of Ruet / who hadde maryed a
knyght of Englande / who was as than deed / 
and the duke had by her thre chyldren / two ſonnes
and a doughter / the eldeſt called Iohan / 
otherwyſe lorde Beauforde of Lancaſtre / the
duke loued hym entyerly / the other was called
Thomas / the duke brought him vp at Aſque / 
he was a good clerke and connynge in
bothe lawes / he was a great iuryſt and legyſt / 
and was after byſſhoppe of Lyncolne. The
duke of Lancaſtre for the loue he had to his
chyldren / he wedded their mother the lady Katheryn
of Ruet / wherof there was moche marueyle

bothe in Englande and in Fraunce / for
ſhe was but of a baſe lynage / in regarde to the
two other wyues. And whan the knowledge
of the maryage of the duke to this lady Kateryne
of Ruet was come to the great ladyes
of Englande / as the ducheſſe of Glouceſtre / 
the counteſſe of Derby / the counteſſe of Arundell / 
and other ladyes dyſcended of the blode
royall of Englande / they meruayled moche / 
and layd gret blame to the duke for that dede / 
and ſayde / howe the duke of Lancaſtre was
greatly to dyſprayſe / to mary his concubyne / 
for by reaſon therof ſhe ſhulde be the ſeconde
perſon in honoure in Englande / wherby they
ſayd the quene ſhulde be ſhamefully acompanyed / 
and ſayde howe ſurely they wolde nat
come in to no place where ſhe ſhulde be preſente / 
and more ouer they ſayde / it ſhulde be a
great ſhame for theym / that ſuche a ducheſſe
come of ſo baſe a blode (and concubyne to the
duke in his other wyfes dayes) ſhulde go and
haue the preemynence before them / they ſayde
their hertes ſhulde breke for ſorowe. bothe the
duke of Glouceſtre and the ducheſſe his wyfe
ſpake of this mater / and ſayd howe the duke
of Lancaſtre was nat wyſe / but fowle ouerſene
to marry his concubyne / and ſayde they
wold neuer do her honoure / nor call her ſuſter.
The duke of yorke paſſed it ouer lyghtly
ynough / for he was euer lyghtly reſydente aboute
the kynge and with the duke of Lancaſtre.
The duke of Glouceſtre was of a nother
maner / for he ſette by no man / though he were
yongeſt brother / he was orgulous and preſumptuous
of maner / and therto be enclyned
his nature / and alwayes agaynſt the kynges
opynions and his counſaylours. Thus this
lady Kateryne of Ruet was ducheſſe of Lancaſtre / 
and was as the ſeconde perſone in Englande / 
and was moche aboute the kynge / as
ſhe that knewe moche honour / for in her youth
and all her dayes ſhe had ben brought vp therin / 
and the Duke loued greatly the chyldren
that he had by her / and that he ſhewed well in
his lyfe and after his dethe.
            
               YE haue herde here before howe
iugement of the parliament was
gyuen agaynſt ſyr Peter of Craon / 
and howe he was condempned
in a hundred thouſande frankes / 
to be payed to the Quene of Napoles.
Whan the ſayde ſyr Peter ſawe howe he was
condempned he was ſore abaſſhed / for outher
he muſte paye the ſōme / or els abyde ſtyll priſoner.
Than he was counſayled by the duke
of Burgoyne and by the ducheſſe / yt he ſhulde
requyre the yonge quene of Englande to be
meane for hym to the quene of Napoles / that
he myght be releaſed oute of pryſone fyftene
dayes to go abrode in Parys / to ſewe to his
frendes to pay his fynaūce / or els to fynd ſureties
for him tyll he myght go in to Bretaygne
to gather amonge his frendes the ſame ſōme.
So at the deſyre of the yonge quene of Englande / 
the quene of Napoles was contente
that he ſhulde go all the day abrode in Paris / 
and at nyght alwayes to yelde hymſelfe priſoner
in to the caſtell of Lowre / and there to
remayne all the night. After this rate he went
abrode and ſewed to many of his blode and
frendes / but he coulde fynde none that wolde
abyde there priſoner for hym / the ſōme was ſo
great. And at the ende of the fyftene dayes he
was fayne to returne priſoner bothe day and
nyght / and was kept ſtreyghter than he was
before at his coſt and charge.
            
               NOwe lette vs a lytell ſpeke of the
iourney of therle of Neuers and
the lordes of Fraunce / and what
they dyd the ſame ſōmer in Hungery.
And after we ſhall ſpeke of
the goynge in to Freſe of the erle of Haynalte
and the erle of Oſtrenaunt. The erle of Neuers
and his company / with many valyaunt
men that he had of Fraunce and of other countreys / 
whan they were come in to Hungery in
to a great cytie called Bode / the kyng of Hungery
made them good chere / and well they deſerued
it / for they were come farre of to ſe him.
The entenſyon of the kynge was / that or he
ſette forwarde with his puyſſaunce / and with
the ayde of Fraunce to entre in to the felde / to
here fyrſte ſome newes fro the great turke called
Lamorabaquy / who had ſent hym worde
in the moneth of February that ſurely he wolde
be in Hungery or the ende of the moneth
of Maye / and that he wolde paſſe the water
of Dunce / of whiche meſſage many had great
marueyle. And ſome ſayde that there is in a
manner nothynge but that man maye do it / 
conſyderynge that the turke is valyaunt and
puyſſaūt / and deſyreth moche dedes of armes

therfore ſythe he hath ſaid it by all lykelyhode
he wyll do it / and if he paſſe nat the Dunce to
come hyther to this ſyde / than lette vs paſſe
ouer and entre in to Turkey with puyſſaūce / 
for the kynge of Hungery with ſuche ayde as
he hath of ſtraungers / ſhall well make an hundred
thouſande men / and ſuche a nombre of
ſuche men are well able to conquere all Turkey / 
and to go in to the empyre of Perce / and
if we may haue one iourney of vyctory vpon
the great turke / we ſhall do after what we lyſt
and ſhall conquere Surey / and all the holy
lande of Iheruſalem / and ſhall delyuer it fro
the handes of the Sodayne and the enemyes
of god / for at the ſōmer nexte commynge / the
Frenche kynge and the kynge of Englande / 
who wyll conioyne togyther / ſhall reyſe vp a
great nombre of men of armes and of archers
and ſhall fynde the paſſages open to receyue
them / than nothyng ſhall abyde before vs / but
all ſhall be conquered and put in oure obeyſaunce / 
whan we ſhall go all togyther. Thus
deuyſed the Frenche men that were in the realme
of Hungery.
            WHan the moneth of May was come
truſtynge to here tydynges of Lamorabaquy
the greate Turke / the
kynge of Hungery ſent to the paſſages of the
ryuer of Dunce / and ſent through out his realme
to aſſemble his puiſſaunce togyder / and
the lordes of the Rodes came to hym ſtrongly / 
and all the moneth of May they taryed for
the comyng of the ſarazyns / but no tydynges
coulde be herde of them. Than the kynge of
Hungery ſente ſuche as knewe the countrey
beyonde the ryuer of Dunce / to ſerche to haue
ſōme tydynges of the great turke. Suche as
wente ſertched all the countrey beyonde the
Braſe of ſaynt George / and to the marches of
Alexaundre / of Damas / and Antyoche / but
they coulde here no newes of Lamorabaquy
nor of none army towarde. Than they retourned
and ſhewed the king what they had herde
and ſene. Than the kynge aſſembled his counſayle / 
and called the lordes of Fraunce / who
deſyred to do dedes of armes. The kyng ſhewed
them howe he had ſente men in to Turkey
to haue knowlege what his enemies dyd / 
and howe they coulde here no tydinges of Lamorabaquy / 
nor no lykelyhode of his aprochyng / 
for all ye promeſſe he had made to paſſe
the Dunce / and to entre in to Hūgery to ſight
with the Cryſten men or mydde May ſhulde
paſſe / wherfore the kynge demaunded what
counſayle they wolde gyue hym to do. Than
the lorde of Coucy for all the other / ſayd. Syr
though Lamorabaquy come nat forwarde acordynge
to his promeſſe / and maketh but a

                  •
               ape therof / yet that ought nat to lette vs to do
dedes of armes / and to purſue our enemyes / 
ſeynge we be aſſembled to yt purpoſe. Thus
all the frenchmen / almayns / and other ſtraungers
ſhewed well howe they had great deſyre
to ſeke out Lamorabaquy to fyght with him / 
whiche was to their great honour. The lorde
of Coucyes wordes were affyrmed by all the
ſtraungers / it was all their opynyons howe
they coulde enploye their ſeaſon and tyme no
better. Than it was ordeyned by the kynge
and by his marſhalles that euery man ſhulde
prepare hymſelfe to be redy to ſette forwarde
at a daye aſſygned / whiche was the vtas of
ſaynt Iohan the baptyſt. Than offycers and
other ſeruauntes aparelled for their maiſters
all thynges neceſſary / and the Frenche men
thynkynge to be freſſhe and gay / ſpared nouther
Golde nor ſyluer. Their departure fro
Bode the ſoueraygne cytie of Hungery was
goodly to regarde. The conſtable of Hungery
had the vowarde with a great nombre of
hungaryons and almayns with him / bycauſe
he knewe the countreys. And nexte after hym
rode the frenche menne with the conſtable of
Fraunce / the erle de la Marche / the lorde of
Coucy / ſyr Henry and ſyr Phylyppe of Bare
and dyuers other. And with the kynge rode
the great lordes of his countrey / as reaſone
was / and beſyde the kyng rode Iohan of Burgoyne / 
& often tymes deuyſed with the kyng.
They were in the felde a threſcore thouſande
horſe / they hadde but fewe a foote / ſauynge
ſuche as were folowers. The company of the
cryſten men were noble and well ordred / and
of Hungery there were many croſebowes a
horſebacke. the army iourneyed ſo longe that
they came to the ryuer of Dunce / and paſſed
ouer in ſhyppes and barges / and ſuche bridges
as they had ordeyned for that purpoſe. It
was eight dayes or they were all paſſed ouer / 
and as they paſſed they lodged theym / euery
company taryenge for other. This ryuer of
Dunce departeth ye realmes of Hungery and
Turkey a ſonder.
            
               
WHan the chriſten men were all ouer
and nothynge taryed behynde / and
were in the frōters of Turkey / they
greatlye reioyſed and deſyred greatly to do
dedes of armes. There they toke counſayle
and determyned to go and ley ſiege to a towne
in Turkey called Coniecte. And as they
ordayned ſo they dyde / & beſieged it as they
myght well do / for it ſtode in a playne countrey / 
and a ryuer ioynynge to it with ſhyppes
theron / called Necte: the heed cōmynge
out of Turkey / and fallynge in to the ſee at
the ryuer of Dunce. The ryuer of Dunce
is a great Ryuer of thre hundred myles in
length / fro the begynnynge tyll it entre in to
the See. Whiche were the mooſt profytable
ryuer in all the worlde / for the realme of Hū
               gry / 
if the ſhyppes that be theron myght iſſue
out therof in to the See / but they can nat
For in the mouthe therof whan they ſhulde
iſſue in to the ſee / there is in the ryuer a moū
               tayne
whiche departeth the ryuer in two ꝑtes / 
and maketh ſuche brute and noyſe / that
it maye well be herde ſeuyn myle of / and for
that cauſe there is no ſhyppe yt dare aproche
nere to it. I longe by this ryuer ſyde there
be fayre medowes and paſtures / wherby all
the countrey is well ſerued / and dyuers vynes / 
whiche in ſeaſone make good wynes / 
whiche the Turkes do make and putte in to
Goot ſkynnes / and ſelleth it vnto Chriſten
men: For accordyng to their lawe / they dare
drinke no wyne to be knowen. It is defended
them on payne of lyfe. But they eate the
reyſynges / and they haue other good frutes
and ſpyces / wherof they make drinke / and
vſe greatly to drinke Gootes mylke / whiche
refreſſheth theym in the hote ſeaſon. Thus
the kynge of Hungry and his hooſt lodged
before the cytie of Coniecte at their eaſe and
pleaſure / for no manne troubled their ſiege.
And whan they came before the Cytie / they
foūde the frutes rype / the whiche was great
pleaſure to them. They made to this Cytie
dyuers aſſautes / and they within defended
them ſelfe / truſtyng dayly to haue ayde and
ſocour of Lamorabaquy their lorde / to reyſe
the ſiege with puyſſaunce. But he dyde nat / 
wherby the Cytie was taken by force of aſſaute / 
and diſtroyed with great ſlaughter
of men / women / and chyldren. For the chriſten
men that entred hadde no mercy nor pytie.
Whan̄e this Cytie was thus wonne / the
kyng of Hungry diſlodged and wente forwarde
in to Turkey / and was determyned
to go and ley ſiege to a great cytie called Nicopoly.
and as they rode / they foūde in their
waye the towne of Quayre / and layde ſiege
to it fyftene dayes or it was won / but finallye
it was won by aſſaute / & clene diſtroyed.
And ſo paſſed forthe / and in their waye they
founde another towne and a ſtronge caſtell
called Brehappe / and a knyght of Turkey
was lorde therof / and was within the caſtell
to defende it. The kyng and his army were
lodged within a myle where was a fayre ryuer / 
and about the towne there was none.
There the erle of Neuers was made knight
and reyſed his banner / and with hym were
made mo than thre hundred knyghtes / & all
they & their companies went before Brehap / 
and beſieged it and wan the towne perforce
within four dayes / but nat the caſtell it was
ſo ſtrong. The lorde of Brehap ſaued moche
of his people byforce of the caſtell / who was
called Corbodas / a right valyant knyght / &
he had other thre bretherne / one named Maladius / 
another Balachius / & the thirde Rufyn.
After this towne was won / the chriſten
men were before the caſtell ſeuyn dayes and
made dyuers aſſautes / but they loſte more
than they wanne. The foure knyghtes bretherne
yt were within / ſhewed well by their
defence / that they were valyant men. Whan
the Frenche men hadde conſydred well the
force of the caſtell / and the valyaunt ordr
                  ••
               
               ge
of the turkes within / and the defence that
they made / They ſawe well than̄e they loſte
their payne / and ſo diſlodged / for they had
knowledge howe the kyng of Hungry wolde
go and laye ſiege to the ſtronge towne of
Nicopolye. Thus the ſiege before Brehap
brake vp / and they within the Caſtell were
in peace but the towne was clene brent. than
the erle of Neuers and all the lordes of Frā
               ce
reſorted to the kynges armye / ordring thē
ſelfe to go to Nicopoly.
            
               WHan̄e Corbodas of Brehappe
ſawe the ſiege brokenne vp / he
was right ioyfull / and ſayde to
his cōpany. We nede no more to
fere this ſeaſon though my towne
be brent and exiled / I ſhall right well recouer

it agayne / but of one thynge I maru

                  •
                that I can here no
newes fro my lorde the kyng Beſant / called
Lamorabaquy. for the laſt tyme that I ſawe
hym in the cytie of Nicopoly / he ſayde vnto
me / that this May tyme he wolde be in this
countrey / and had entencyon to paſſe with a
great puyſſaunce the braſe of ſaynt George / 
and to go in to Hūgry to fight with the chriſten
men / and ſo he 
                  •
               ent worde to the kyng of
Hungry / and yet he hath done nothyng. and
thervpon they of Hūgry be fortifyed / and haue
as nowe great ſocour out of Fraūce / and
haue paſſed the ryuer of Dunce / and are entred
in to Turkey / and haue and do diſtroye
the countre / for there is no reſiſtence made againſt
thē / & they thinke ſurely to go and lay
ſiege before Nicopoly. The cytie is ſtronge
ynoughe to reſyſt the ſiege a longe ſeaſon / if
it be well defended & kepte. We are here 
                  •
               our
bretherne and knyghtes of the lynage of kynge

Maladyus / we ſhall go to the Cytie of
Nicopoly / to ayde / to helpe and defende it / &
my brother Balachyus ſhall abyde here to
kepe this caſtell of Brehap / and my brother
Rufyne ſhall paſſe the braſe of ſaynt George
and go ſeke out Lamorabaquy / & ſhewe him
euery thynge that is paſt & done / and aduyſe
hym for his honoure to entēde to defende his

that maye reſyſt the chriſten men / and to breke
their purpoſe / or els he ſhall leſe ye realme
of Armony / whiche he hath conquered / and
his owne countrey alſo. For by all ymagynacyon
the kynge of Hungry and the Chriſten
men are gadered / to thentent to do ſome
great enterprice. His thre bretherne agreed
to his ſayeng. On this apoyntment they prepared
them ſelfe to departe.
            
               SO in this ſeaſon ſiege was laid
before Nicopolye / and Corbodas
of Brehappe & Maladyus
his brother / came and entred in
to Nicopoly / wherof they of the
cytie were ryght ioyfull / and Balachyus abode
ſtyll at Brehappe to kepe the caſtell. &
Rufyn whan he ſawe tyme be nyght he paſſed
the Chriſten army / for he knewe well the
countre / and paſſed ouer the braſe ſaynt George / 
and 
                  •
               erched for Lamorabaquy / and the
ſame ſeaſon he was at Quayre with the ſoudane
of Babylone / to haue ayde of men of
hym. Rufyn foūde this turke there / & whan
kynge Beſant ſawe hym he had marueyle / 
and thought ſurely he ſhulde here ſome newes
out of Turkey. Than̄e he demaunded
what tidynges. ſir quod Rufyn / all the coū
               trey
deſyreth ſore to ſe you there / for ye kyng
of Hungry with puiſſaunce hath paſſed the
ryuer of Dunce / and is entred in to Turkey
and hath done great dōmage and hath brent
and aſſayled a fyue or ſixe of your cloſed townes.
And whan I departed fro Brehappe / 
he was in purpoſe to go and leye ſiege to Nicopoly.
Corbodas and Maladyus my brother / 
with ſuche men of warre as they haue / 
are en
                  •
               red in to Nicopoly to helpe to defēde
the towne / & my brother Balachyus is ſtyll
at Brehappe / to kepe the caſtell there. And
ſir / of ſuretie there is in the company with
the kynge of Hungry / the goodlyeſt armye
and beſt apoynted come out of Fraunce that
euer was ſene. Wherfore ſir / it behoueth you
to aſſemble your hooſt and frendes / and retourne
in to Turkey / to cauſe your enemyes
to retourne agayne ouer the ryuer of Dūce / 
and ye do it nat with gret puyſſaūce / it wyll
be harde to bring it about. What nombre be
they quod Lamorabaquy? ſir quod he / they
be mo than a hundred thouſande / & the good
lyeſt men o
                  •
                the worlde / and beſt armed / and
all on horſ backe. Lamorabaquy gaue none
anſwere / but entred in to the Soudans chā
               bre / 
and ſhewed the Soudane all the hole
mater / as his knyght had ſhewed hym. than
the ſoudane ſayd. We muſt prouyde for it / ye
ſhall haue men ynowe to reſyſt thē. Nedes
we muſt defēde our lawe and our herytage.
That is true ſir quod Lamorabaquy.
            NOwe my deſyres arre come to paſſe / 
for I haue alwayes deſyred none other
thynge / but that the kynge of Hungry
with his puiſſaunce / myght ones come ouer
the ryuer of Dunce / and entre in to Turkey.
In the begynnynge I wyll ſuffre a ſeaſon / 
but at the ende they ſhall paye for the ſcotte.
Of all this I hadde knowledge four monethes
paſte / by my great Frende the lorde of
Myllayne / who ſente me Go. haukes / Gerfaucons / 

and faucons / to the nombre of .xii.
whiche were the beſt and fayreſt that euer I
ſawe. And with this preſent he wrote to me
by name / all the heedes and chiefe capitayns
of the barones of Fraunce / ſuche as ſhulde
come to make me warre. In the whiche letters
was alſo conteyned / that if I might get
them in my daunger / they ſhulde be worthe
to me a myllyon of floreyns. And alſo / howe
there ſhulde be in their company of the lymytees
of Fraunce / mo than fyue hūdred knightes / 
valyaunt men of armes. Alſo the Duke
of Myllaygne wrote / that ſurely they wyll
gyue me batayle / wherfore I wyll prepare
to mete with them / by arte / aduiſe / and good
ordynaunce / for they are men of great feate / 
and ſo valiaunt in armes / that they wyll nat
flye nor recule / they are worthy o
                  •
                thanke to
iſſue out of their owne nacyon by valyauntneſſe / 
to fynde dedes of armes. And I truſte
to accōplyſſhe their deſyres within thre monethes / 
ſo that they ſhall haue ynoughe to
do.
            TO cōſydre theſe wordes / one ought
greatly to marueyle / that the Lorde
Galeas erle of Vertues and Duke
of Myllayne (who was reputed to be a chriſten
man / baptyſed and regenerate after the
Chriſten Lawe) wolde ſeke or requyre loue
or alyaunce with a kynge myſcreant / out
of our lawe and faythe / or to ſende hym gyftes
and preſentes / as he dyde euery yere: As
dogges / haukes / and fyne lynen clothes / whiche
are ryght pleſaunt to the Sarazins / for
they haue none but that cometh fro our parties.
Alſo the great Turke ſent to hym agayne
other preſentes of ryche clothe of golde
and precyous ſtones / wherof the Sarazins
haue great plentie. But in thoſe dayes the
erle of Vertues duke of Myllayne and ſir
Galeas his father reygned as tyrantes / and
ſo helde their ſignories.
            It is marueyle to thynke of their dedes / 
and fyrſte howe they entred and opteygned
the ſignorie of Myllayne. So it was there
were thre bretherne / the lorde Manfres / the
lorde Galeas / and the lorde Barnabo. They
hadde an vncle who was archebyſſhoppe of
Myllayne. And ſo it fortuned / that whan ye
lorde Charles of Luſenbourge kyng of Boeſme
and of Almayne & emperour of Rome / 
who reigned after kyng Loyes of Bauyer / 
who opteygned to the Empyre byforce / for
he was neuer taken as Emperour by ye churche / 
but excōmunycate and a curſed by pope
Innocent / who reygned as than̄e. For this
Loyes of Bauyer went to Rome and made
hymſelfe to be crowned emperour by a pope
and .xii. cardynalles that he made. And as
ſoone as he was crowned / he made the Almayns
to be payed their wages / to ouer ryn
Rome and to robbe and to pyll it. this was
the rewarde that the romayns had for receyuyng
of hym / wherfore he dyed excōmunicat
and in that ſentence. The pope and cardynalles
that he made / without any conſtreyn
                  •
               
came after to Auignon / and ſubmytted them
ſelfes to pope Innocent / who reigned before
Vrbayne the fyfthe / and there were aſſoyled
of their errours. ¶Nowe to purpoſe howe
the lordes of Myllayne came fyrſt to that ſignorie / 
I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            
               SO it was / the archebyſſhoppe
of Myllayne / at a tyme receyued
kynge Charles of Boeſme
emperour / in to ye cytie of Myllayne
nobly and tryumphantlye / 
after the Emperour had been before Axe
the Chapell / and had accomplyſſhed there
his .xl. dayes / accordyng to the vſage in the
caſe parteyning / and for the great chere that
he made to the Emperour / and for a hundred
thouſande ducates that he lent to the Emperour.
He made the byſſhop vycoūt of Myllayne
and his nephewes after hym for euer / 
to holde the lande and ſignorie of Mylayne
free at his wyll / vnto the tyme that the Emperour
hadde payde agayne at one tyme the
ſayd ſōme of a hundred thouſande ducates.
And ſo after the byſſhoppe dyed / and ye lorde
Manfres his nephue / by the accorde of the
Emperour and for loue of his vncle / was receyued
in to the ſignorie of Myllayne. than
his two bretherne / who as than were nat very
riche / the lorde Galeas and the lorde Barnabo / 
counſayled toguyder & determyned to
reigne / and to holde the landes of Lōbardy
bytwene thē / and to cōioyne thē by mariage
to ſome great lordes to maynteyne their eſtates / 
and to cauſe men to feare their diſpleaſures.
And ſo they cauſed their brother Mā
               freſe
to be ſlayne by venyme / or otherwyſe / 

after whoſe dethe they reygned puiſſauntly
byforce and polycy. All their dayes they lyued
in good accorde toguyder / and departed
the cyties of Lombardy bytwene them.
The lorde Galeas hadde tenne / bycauſe he
was the eldeſt and the lorde Bernabo nyne.
And the cytie of Myllayne was gouerned
one yere by the one brother and another yere
by the other brother. And to the entent to reigne
puiſſauntly / they ſought the wayes to
gader great rycheſſe by rayſinge vp in poſſyons / 
ſubſydies / and gabelles / and many
other yuell cuſtomes / wherby they gadered
great ſtore of golde and ſyluer. and they cauſed
their townes and cyties to be kepte with
ſoudyours ſtraungers / as Almaygnes / Frē
               che
men / Bretons / Englyſſhmen / and of all
other nacyons / excepte their owne countrey
men / for they hadde no truſt nor affiaunce in
them / for feare of rebellyon agaynſt thē. and
theſe ſoudyours were payed fro moneth to
moneth / wherby they were ſo douted and fered
of the people / that none durſte diſpleaſe
them. For if any dyd ryſe or dyde any thyng
agaynſt them / there was cruell vengeaunce
taken vpon them. They diſtroyed many a
one in their dayes / to gyue enſāple to other.
            IN all their ſignories no man hadde
any thynge but atte their pleaſure / 
They wolde tayle a ryche man thre
or foure tymes in a yere. They ſayd that lō
               bardes
were ouer proude and preſūptuous / 
in their richeſſe / wherfore it was behouable
to kepe them vnder ſubiection / no man durſt
ſaye nay to any thyng that they cōmaunded.
            Theſe two bretherne maryed them hyghlye / 
and bought their wyues with the goodꝭ
and ſubſtaunce of their people. The lorde
Galeas hadde to wyfe the ſuſter of the good
erle of Sauoye / named Blaunche / & payde
to the erle for her a hundred thouſande ducates.
The lorde Barnabo maryed hym in Almaygne / 
to the ſuſter of the duke of Breſnyche / 
and payde no leſſe money than his brother
dyd. Theſe two bretherne hadde many
chyldren / and maryed them highly and richelye
/ to atteyne therby great alyaunces. The
lorde Galeas had a ſone called Galleas / and
as than the father vnderſtode that whā kynge
Iohan of Fraunce was come out of Englande / 
and put to raūſome to .xxx.C. thouſand
frankes / and they of Fraunce wyſt nat
howe to reyſe the fyrſte payment. Than̄e he
treated with the Frenche kynge and his coū
               ſayle
to haue one of his doughters for Galeas
his ſonne. The kynge and his coūſayle
entended to this treatie / bycauſe they knewe
well this lorde Galeas was grounded in richeſſe / 
and thus he bought the kyngꝭ doughter
for ſixe hundred thouſande frankes / whiche
were tourned in payment to the Kynge
of Englande. And ſo his ſonne maryed kynge
Iohans doughter / and to hym was gyuen
the countie and erldome of Vertues in
Champaygne. Of that ſonne and doughter
iſſued a doughter / whiche byforce of golde
and ſyluer was maryed to the ſeconde ſonne
of kynge Charles of Fraunce / called Loyes
duke of Orlyaunce erle of Bloyes and Valoyes.
The maryage coſt the erle of Vertus
father to the ſayde lady / tenne hundred thouſaunde
frankes. And the countie of Bloyes
was bought of the erle Guye of Bloyes: as
it hath ben conteyned here before in this hyſtorie.
Thus theſe lordes / Galeas and Barnabo / 
acorded right well toguyder all their
lyue dayes: they neuer varyed nor their people
toguyder / therfore they reigned in great
puiſſaunce. No man coude haue reaſon nor
right of them / Pope / cardynalles / nor other
that made any warre agaynſt them / ſauyng
alonely the marques of Moūtferant / & that
was by the meanes of the lorde Iohan Hacon / 
and the Englyſſhe men with the routes
of the companyons / whiche Iohan Hacon
brought them out of Prouynce in to Lombardy / 
and made there great warre.
            
               THan at laſt dyed this lorde Galeas / 
and after hym reigned his
ſonne erle of Vertues / named
Galeas in great puyſſaūce. and
at the begynnyng of his reigne
he gate him great loue in Lombardy / and or
/ dred hymſelfe after a goodly maner and like
a wyſe man. He put downe all ſuche yuell cuſtomes
as his father had reyſed in Lōbardy
He was ſo well beloued and of ſo good renome
that euery man ſayd well of hym / but
at laſte whan̄e he ſawe his tyme / he ſpytted
out his venyme / whiche he had longe borne
in his hert. For he made on a day in ye feldes
a great buſſhement / wherby the lorde Bernabo

his vncle was takē who thought none
yuell / nor knewe nat but that he was welbeloued / 
and in great fauour with his nephue.
And at his takyng it was ſayd to hym. One
lorde is ynough to reygne in Lombardy / he
coude haue none other grace / for it laye nat
in hym as than̄e to make reſyſtence. So he
was ledde to a caſtell / and there his nephue
cauſed hym to dye / but in what maner I can
nat ſhewe you. This ſir Bernabo had two
fayre chyldren / of whom the Frenche quene
was doughter / to one of his doughters whiche
was wedded to the duke of Oſrtenaunt
of Bauyere. This Galeas putte in priſone
all his vncles chyldren / ſuche as he coulde
gette / and tooke poſſeſſyon of all his vncles
ſeignories / and ioyned thē to his owne / & ſo
reigned in great puyſſaunce & richeſſe / for he
reyſed vp ſuche maters / wherby he gathered
toguyder great rycheſſe: As Impoſycions / 
gabels / ſubſydies / dyſmes / and all other extorcyons / 
wherby he was moche more dreed
than beloued. He helde the errour and opynyon
of his Father (that was) Howe one
ſhulde nother honoure nor worſhyppe god.
He tooke fro abbeyes and priories moche of
their reuenewes / and toke them to hym ſelfe.
He ſayd the monkes were to delyciouſly noriſſhed
with good wynes and delycious metes.
By whiche ſuperfluyteis (he ſayd) they
coude nat ryſe at mydnight / nor do their ſeruyce
as they ſhulde do. He ſayde: ſaynt Benet
helde nat the order of his relygion after
that maner. And ſo (he ſaid) he wolde make
them to lyue with egges and ſmall wyne / to
clere their voyces to ſyng the higher. Theſe
lordes in their dayes lyued lyke popes: they
dyde great diſpytes in their tyme to men of
holy churche: They ſette nothyng by the popes
curſe / and ſpecially after ye ciſme began / 
and that there was two popes: that the one
curſed the other aſſoyled. The lordes of myllayne
dyde but mocke at their doynges / and
ſo dyd many other lordes through ye worlde.
The doughter of this lorde Galeas duke of
Myllayne was duches of Orl aūce / whoſe
condycions were lyke to her fathers and nat
to her mothers / who was doughter to kyng
Iohan of Fraunce. This lady was of high
mynde / enuyous and couytous / on the delytes
& ſtate of this worlde. Gladly ſhe wolde
haue ſene the duke her huſbande to haue attaygned
to the crowne of Fraunce / ſhe had
nat cared howe. A generall fame and ſclaunder
ran vpon her / that all the infyrmiteis the
kyng had / whiche no phiſycion coude remedye / 
came all by her ſortes and artes / and the
chiefe diſcouerynge of her workes / wherby
ſhe was had in great ſuſpecte was this.
            THis ducheſſe of Orlyaunce named
Valantyne had a ſonne by the duke
her huſbande / a fayre chylde of the
age of the Dolphyn / ſonne to the kynge.
On a tyme theſe two chyldren were playeng
toguyder in the ducheſſe of Orlyaunce chambre / 
and ſodaynly there was caſte downe an
apple full of poyſon on the pauement / on the
ſame ſyde yt the dolphyn was on / to thentent
that he ſhulde haue taken and eaten it. But
as grace was he dyd nat / for the duches ſon̄e
ran after the apple and toke it / and ete therof
wherwith he was poyſoned and dyed / nothynge
coude ſaue hym. And ſuche as hadde
Charles the yong dolphyn to kepe toke hym
thens / and he neuer came after in the duches
chambre. Of this aduēture great brute and
murmuracyon ran throughe all the cytie of
Parys / and in other places. Thus it was
ſayde by her of all the people / ſo that the duke
her huſbande parceyued it well / for brute
ranne through Parys / that if her huſbande
dyde nat putte her awaye out of the kynges
courte / they wolde fetche her awaye byforce / 
and cauſe her to dye. For the people ſaid ſhe
wolde enpoyſon the kyng and his chyldren / 
and that ſhe hadde enchaunted the kyng / for
the kyng in all his infyrmyteis wolde nat ſe
the quene / nor none other woman / but all onlye
this ducheſſe of Orlyaunce. Vpon whiche
ſayeng and for doute therof / her huſbāde
had her awaye / and put her out of the houſe
of ſaynt Poule in Parys / and ſente her to a
caſtell beſyde Parys vpon the waye of Beauoyes / 
called Aſynyers. And there ſhe was
kepte a longe ſeaſon / and neuer wente out of
the caſtell / and at laſt ſhe was ſent fro thens
to Newcaſtell on the ryuer of Loyre. And ye
duke of Orlyaunce had great diſpleaſure to
her / bycauſe of the aduēture of ye dethe of his
ſon / but by reaſon yt he had other chyldren by
her / ſōwhat it brake his diſpleaſure. Theſe
tidynges came to Myllayne / and the lorde
Galeas was enfourmed howe his doughter

was in trouble and in great daunger / wherof
he was ſore diſpleaſed with the Frenche
kyng and his counſayle. Than he ſent a ſuffycient
meſſanger / as ſir Iaquemont of Weryne
and other to Parys / to ye kyng and his
counſayle / in excuſyng his doughter / ſayeng
that if any perſone wolde accuſe her of trayſon / 
he ſhulde be fought with all at vttraūce
in that quarell. Whan theſe meſſangers cāe
to Parys / the kynge was in good helth / but
he tooke no hede of thoſe meſſangers / nor of
their excuſe: and ſo they were ſhortely aunſwered
nothyng to their pleaſure. So they
retourned in to Lombardy / and declared to
the duke of Myllayne all that they had ſene
and done. Than the duke was in gretter diſpleaſure
than he was before / and reputed it
a great iniury / and than ſent his defyaunce
to the Frenche kynge / and to all the hole Realme
of Fraunce. And whan his defyaunces
were brought to Parys / the lordes & knightes
with the Frenche armye were as than in
Hūgry / and entred in to Turkey. And for ye
diſpyte and hate that the duke of Myllayne
had to the Frenche kynge and to ſome of his
counſayle / therfore he helde in amyte and alyaunce
the great Turke / and ſhewed hym
of the ſecretes of Fraūce. ¶Nowe we ſhall
leaue ſpekynge of the duke / and ſpeke of the
great Turke and of the barons of Fraunce / 
and of other Chriſten knyghtes / that were
as than in Turkey.

            ¶Howe the great turke deſyred the
ſoudan / and many other kynges ſarazyns
to ayde hym with menne of
warre / to reſyſt agaynſt the chriſten
men / and howe many valyant ſarazyns
came to hym out of farre countreis.
Cap. CC.xi.
            IT was nat longe after / but
that the great Turke departed fro
Quayre fro the Soudan / who promyſed
to ſende hym ſhortely great ayde / of
the beſt men of armes of all his ſignories / to
reſyſt agaynſt the puiſſaunce of the kynge of
Hungry and the Frēche men. And the great
turke ſente in to all realmes and countreis / 
where as he thought to haue any ayde & ſocour.
For he conſydred and ſayd / that if the
Frenche men conquered Turkey / all other
realmes adioyning ſhulde trimble for feare
of them / and therby their faythe and beleue
ſhulde decaye / and become vnder the ſubiection
of the Chriſten men / whiche they had
rather dye. And thus at the deſyres of the
Soudan and the great turke / many kyngꝭ
ſarazyns enclyned vnto their deſyres / as in
Perce / in Mede / and in Trace / and alſo out
of the Septentryon / and out of the realme
of Lecto / and to the boundes of Pruce. And
for asmoch as they were enformed that their
enemyes the Chriſten men were flour of chiualry.
Theſe kynges ſarazins and other lordes
of their lawe / dyde chuſe out among thē
the beſt traueylynge and experte men of armes
in all their countreis. This aſſembly
coude nat be ſodaynly done / nor theirpuruy
aunces ſo ſoone done. The great Turke ſet
hym ſelfe forwardes in to the felde / alwayes
abyding for his people that came to hym fro
farre coūtreis / and ſpecially out of Tartary
Mede and Perce. There aſſembled many
valyant ſarazins out of all countreis. They
were deſyrous to proue their ſtrengthes agaynſt
the Chriſten men. ¶Nowe lette vs

            ¶Howe the lorde of Coucy & other
lordes of the chriſtēmen / about a .v.
hundred ſpeares diſcōfited a fyftene
thouſande turkes / duryng the ſiege
before Nicopoly. Cap. CC.xii.
            
               THey that were beſiege with
in the ſtrong towne of Nycopolye / 
defended themſelfe right valyantly / 
how be it they were ſore
abaſſhed that they herde no tydī
               ges
for the great turke. The Emperour of
Conſtantyne the noble had written vnto thē
               
that he was in the parties of Alexandre / and
was nat as than paſſed ye braſe ſaynt George.
So the cryſten men helde their ſyege ſtyll before
Nycopoly. They had vytayles plentye
and good chepe / that came out of Hungery / 
and other marches nere adioynynge. And on
a day the lorde Coucy and other frenche men
tooke pleaſure to ryde forthe at aduenture to
go ſe the countrey further in. So they departed
fro the ſiege about the nombre of fyue hundred
ſpeares and as many croſbowes and archers
all horſemen. The lorde Coucy was capytayne
of that iourney and the lorde Raynolde
of Roye / and the lorde of ſaynt Pye in
his company / & the Chateleyne of Beauoyre / 
the lorde of Mount Caurell / and the Bourge
of Mountquell with dyuers other / and they
had guydes with thē ſuche as knewe the countrey / 
and they had certayne fore ryders well
mounted to diſcouer the coūtrey before them.
The ſame weke there was an armye of the
turkes aſſembled togyther to the nombre of
twenty thouſande men / for they were enfourmed
howe the chryſten men were abrode dyſtroyenge
their countrey / in reſyſtence therof / 
they aſſembled togyder and came to a ſtrayte
whiche the cryſten men muſt paſſe / and they
wolde entre in to the playne of Turkey / and
they coude nat well entre no waye. And there
the turkes taryed a two dayes and coude here
no tydynges of the cryſten menne / and ſo the
thyrde daye they thought to haue retourned.
Than the cryſten mennes foreryders came to
Brechault / nere where the turkes were / and
whan the turkes ſaw them aproche they ſtode
ſtyll cloſe togyther / to ſe the dealynge of the
cryſten men / and made no token nor ſygne to

nere to the turkes / and ſawe well they
were a great nombre / and yet they coulde nat

them they reculed backe / and came to
the lorde Coucy / and ſhewed hym what they

That is true quod all the other knyghtes
that herde hym. Than euery man prepared
hym ſelfe and his horſe and rode towarde
the place where the turkes were. and bytwene
them and the turkes there was a lytell wode.
whan the cryſten men came to the wode ſyde / 
the lorde of Coucy ſaid to the lorde Raynolde
of Roy / and to the lorde of ſaynt Pye. Syrs / 
myne aduyſe is / to the entent to drawe the turkes
out of their ſtrēgth) that ye two ſhall take
two hundred of our ſpeares / and I with the
reſt wyll abyde here in this wode / and ryde ye
ſo nere them that ye may cauſe them to come
out / and than retourne you / and ſuffre them
to chaſe you tyll ye be paſte vs in this wode / 
and than ſodaynly tourne vpon them / and we
ſhall cloſe theym in behynde / and ſo we ſhall
haue them at our wyll. To this aduyſe all the
knightes enclyned. than two hundred of them
that were beſt horſed rode forthe / and the reſt
who were an eyght hundred / enbuſſhed them
ſelfe couertly in the wode / and there taryed.
The other rode forthe / and came to the place
where the turkes were. Whan they ſawe the
cryſten men come / they were ryght ioyouſe / 
wenynge there had been no mo / and ſo came
out of their holdes in to the playne feldes. and
whan the cryſten men ſawe tyme they turned
and fled / and made the turkes to chaſe them.
They were ſo well horſed yt the turkes coulde
nat ouertake them / and they chaſed ſo longe
that they paſſed the wode where as the enbuſſhement
was. Whan the turkes were paſſed / 
the cryſten men iſſued out / and cryed our lady
be with the lorde of Coucy / and ſo daſſhed in
behynde them / and made great occiſion. The
turkes helde them cloſe togyther / whan they
ſawe how they were beſet before and behynde
and dyd put them ſelfe to defence as well as
they myght / but they kept none ordre / for they
were nat ware of the reregarde. And whan
they ſawe them ſelfe ſo ſodaynly ſette on they
were abaſſhed. The Frenche men dyd quyte
them ſelfe lyke valyaunte men of armes / and
ſlewe the turkes at their pleaſure in their flyenge.
There were many ſlayne / the chryſten
men toke none to mercy / happy were they that
coulde eſcape and retourne fro thens as they
came. And than the criſten men that had done
that dede retourned to their hooſt before Nycopoly.
Than tydynges ran ouer all the hooſt
howe the lorde of Coucy by his wyſdome and
valyauntneſſe had dyſcomfyted mo than .xv.
thouſande turkes. Many ſpake well therof / 
but the erle of Ewe prayſed nothing his dede / 

ſayenge howe it was doone by pride / and
howe that he had put the cryſten men (and ſpecyally
his bande) in great aduenture and parell / 
ſayenge that with an handefull of men
he fought folyſſhely with the route of twenty
thouſande turkes / he ſhulde rather (ſeynge he
was in wyl to do dedes of armes / and that the
turkes were on the felde) haue gyuen knowlege
before he aſſayled his enemyes to his hed
capitayne the lorde Iohan of Burgoyne / that
he myght haue had the renome and honour of
that enterpriſe. Beſemynge the erle of Ewe
ſpake thoſe wordes by enuy / that he had to the
lorde of Coucy / for all that voyage he had no
loue to him / bycauſe he ſawe howe the lorde of
Coucy had the loue & fauour of all his company
and of other ſtraūgers / whiche he deſerued
ryght well to haue / for he was ryght nere of
the frenche Kynges blode / and bare in his armes
floure de lyces / and alſo he was cōſtable
of Fraunce. Thus there engendred a great
hate and yuell wyll couertly / bytwene the erle
of Ewe and the lorde Coucy / whiche hatred
at laſt apered clerely / wherby great myſchefe
fell the ſame ſeaſone vpon the cryſten men / as
ye ſhall here after. ¶Nowe we we ſhall leaue to
ſpeke any more at this tyme of this mater and
retourne to ſpeke of the kynges of Englande
and of Fraunce.

            ¶Howe the peace bytwen Englande
and Fraūce contynued / and of the
maryage of the kynge of Englande
with the doughter of Fraunce.
Cap. CC.xiii.
            
               YE haue herde here before
of the mariage of the french kynges
doughter with the kynge of
England / the whiche tyme aproched
nere / and bothe parties well
wyllynge / excepte duke Thomas of Glouceſtre / 
he was nothynge ioyfull therof / for he
ſawe well that by that maryage / there ſhulde
be great confyderacyons and alyaunces bytwene
the two kynges and their Realmes to
lyue in peace / whiche he was lothe to ſe / for he
deſyred rather to haue warre. The ſame ſeaſon
the duke had aboute hym a knyght called
ſyr Iohan Baquegay a ſecrete man / and he
ſet alwayes ye duke to haue warre. The ſame
ſeaſone alſo the duke of Guerles came in to
Englande to ſe the kynge and his vncles / and
offred hym ſelfe to do any lawfull ſeruyce to
the kynge that he myght do / he was bounde
therto by faythe and homage / and he wolde
gladly that the kynge ſhulde haue had watre
rather than peace. This duke and the duke of
Lancaſtre had great cōmunycacyon togyder
of the voyage that the erle of Haynalt and the
erle of Oſtenaunt his ſonne wolde make in
to Freſe. The ſame tyme Fyerebraſe of Vertayne
was in Englande / ſente thyder fro the
erle of Oſtrenant / to gette men of armes and
archers to go in that voyage to Freſe. The
erle of Derby was deſyred to go in that voyage / 
in aydinge of his coſyns of Heynalt. The
gentle erle hadde therto good affectyon / and
ſayde howe he wolde ryght gladly go in that
voyage / ſo that it pleaſed the kynge and his
father. Whan the duke of Guerles came fyrſt
in to Englande / the Duke of Lancaſtre demaunded
of him what he thought of that voyage
in to Freſe. He aunſwered and ſayd that
it was a parylous voyage / and ye Freſe was
a countrey nat lyghtly to be wonne / ſayenge
howe in tymes paſt there had been dyuers erles
of Holande and Heynalte / that haue claymed
their right there and gone thyder to haue
put them in ſubiectyon / but they haue always
loſt their lyues there / affyrmynge howe the
freſons are people without honour / and haue
no mercy. they prayſe nor loue no lorde in the
worlde / they be ſo proude / and alſo their countrey
is ſtronge / for they be enuyroned with
the ſee / and cloſed in with iſſes / rockes / and
maryſſhes / no man can tell howe to gouerne
them but them ſelfe. I haue ben deſyred to go
in that voyage / but I wyll nat / and I counſayle
my coſyn your ſonne the erle of Derby / 
nat to entre in to that voyage / it is no iourney
for hym. I thynke my fayre brother of Oſtrenant
wyll go / for he hath great deſyre therto / 
and wyll haue a bande of haynowayes with
hym / it ſhall be an aduenture if euer they retourne.
Whiche wordes cauſed the Duke of
Lancaſtre to thynke that his ſonne ſhulde nat
go in yt voyage / and ſo ſhewed his ſonne his
entente / and badde hym delaye that mater / for

the kynge nor he wolde nat that he ſhulde go.
Thus the duke of Guerles dyd lette the ayde
that the erle of Haynalte ſhulde haue had of
the erle of Derby. Many thought it was nat
well counſayled / nor yet for none of their honours.
The duke of Guetles all his lyfe / naturally
was Enuyous / preſumptuous / and
proūde. yet for all that Fierebraſe of Vertayn
lette nat his ſute to gette ayde / and dyd ſo his
dyligence that he gate knightes and ſquyers / 
and a two hundred archers. But the erle of
Derby excuſed himſelfe / whiche excuſe he was
fayne to take in gree / and ſawe well that his
wyll was good to go / if the kynge and his father
had nat been. Than the kynge for the auauncement
of his coſyns of Haynalte made
to be ordeyned in the ryuer of Thamyſe veſſelles
and ſhyppes for the men that ſhulde go
in that voyage to Freſe / to aryue at Encuſe a
towne in the countie of Haynalt / at the entre
in to Holande. This towne ſtandeth on the
ſee / within twelue leages by water of the realme
of Freſe.
            THe ſame ſeaſon was ſente in to Englande
fro the frenche kynge / the erle
Valeran of ſaynt Powle / with certayne
artycles concernynge the treatie of the
peace / and with him was ſent Robert the Hermyte / 
whome the kynge of Englande was
gladde to here ſpeke. The erle of ſaint Powle
founde the kynge of Englande and his bretherne
the erles of Brenne and of Huntyngdon / 
and the duke of Lancaſtre the kynges vncles / 
at the manour of Eltham. The kynge receyued
him ioyouſly / and herde well his meſſage / 
and ſayd to hym a parte. Fayre brother
of ſaynt Powle / as to the treatie of peace bytwene
me and my fayre father of Fraunce / I
am right well enclyned therto / but I all alone
canne nat promote that mater. True it is my
bretherne and my two vncles of Lācaſtre and
yorke enclyne ryght well therto / but I haue
another vncle the duke of Glouceſtre / who is
ryght paryllous and a marneylous man / he
letteth it as moche as he can / and dothe what
he canne to drawe the Londoners to his opynyon / 
I feare me to make a rebellyon in my
realme / and that he ſhulde reyſe the people agaynſt
me / whiche is a great paryll / for if the
people of Englande ryſe agayne agaynſt me / 
and haue myne vncle of Glouceſtre on their
parte / and ſuche other barones and knyghtes
of the realme as be of his opynion / my realme
were loſte without remedy / for myne vncle of
Glouceſtre is ſo ſecerte / that no man canne
knowe his mynde. Syr quod the erle of ſaint
Powle / it behoueth you to wynne hym with
fayre / ſwete / and louynge wordes / and gyue
hym great gyftes / if he demaunde any thyng
graunt it him / this is the way wherby ye ſhall
wynne him / ye muſt flatter hym tyll the peace
be made / and that ye haue your wyfe brought
hyther to you / and that doone than ye maye
take other counſayle / ye ſhall be than of the
puyſſaunce to oppreſſe all your rebelles / for
the frenche kynge if nede be ſhall ayde you / of
this ye maye be ſure. In the name of god / ye
ſaye well and thus ſhall I do.
            THe erle of ſaynt Powle was lodged
at London / and often tymes went to
Eltham to ſe the kynge and the duke
of Lancaſtre / and had often tymes cōmunycacion
on this maryage. Therle of ſaint Poule
ſayde howe the frenche kynge ſhulde come to
ſaynt Omers and his vncles / and bring with
hym his doughter / ſo that the kynge of England
wolde come to Calais / and ſo bytwene
ſaynte Omers and Calays / the two kynges
ſhulde mete and ſpeke togyther / wherby by
reaſon of ſyght and ſpekynge togyther ſhulde
encreaſe loue and amyte / and there theſe two
kinges and their vncles ſhulde ſpeke togyder
without any other companye / on the forme of
the peace / and if they conclude nat on ſome
peace / yet at leſte the trewce myght be relonged
to endure for thyrty or .xl. yere / bytwene
the two realmes and their alies. This deuyſe
ſemed right good to the kyng and to his counſayle / 
and hervpon the kynge and other lordes
ſente to Calays to make prouyſyon / and
the kynge deſyred his vncle the duke of Glouceſtre
to go with hym in that iourney / and the
duches his wyfe and his chyldren / and in lyke
wyſe the Dukes and ducheſſes of yorke and
Lancaſtre. And ſo whan euery thynge was redy
the kynge and the erle of ſaynt Powle departed
fro Eltham and rode towardes Caunterbury / 
and after them folowed all other lordes / 
ſuche as ſhulde go in this voyage / and
ſuche as had been deſyred. The erle of ſaynt
Powle paſſed the ſee fyrſt / to the entent to aduertyſe
the Frenche kynge / and ſo paſſed to

Boloyne and ſo to Paris / and there declared
to the frenche kynge and to his vncles howe
he had ſpedde / wherwith they were well content / 
and ſo departed fro Paris / and lytell and
lytell aproched to the cytie of Amyence / and
the kynge of Englande and his vncles came
to Calais / with many lordes and ladyes. And
the duke of Burgoyne one of the frenche kynges
vncles came to ſaynt Omers / and by the
meanes of the Erle of ſaynt Powle and Robert
the hermyte / the duke of Burgoyne came
to Calays / to ſe the kynge of Englande and
his vncles▪ where he was nobly receyued / and
there they coūſayled togyther on certayne artycles
of the peace / wherto the kynge of Englande
lyghtly enclyned. and for to ſay trouth
he cared nat what he dyd / ſo he myght haue
his wyfe.
            WHan the duke of Burgoyne had ben
at Calais two dayes / and had cōmuned
with the kynge of Englande on
the artycles of the peace / the kynge ſayd howe
he wolde ſende all the proceſſe of the artycles
ouer the ſee in to Englande / to beſhewed and
declared there to the people / for he ſayde that
nouther he / nor all the lordes that were there
of Englande / coulde nat conclude fermely on
no peace / without the generall conſentment of
the people of Englande. And more ouer the
kynge ſayde / howe that he muſt fyrſt go ouer
agayne hym ſelfe / and ſo retourne / and therby
make but one iourney. That is well ſaid quod
the duke of Burgoyne / for than at youre retourne / 
euery thynge ſhall be concluded and
perfourmed. Thus the duke of Burgoyne / 
and the erle of ſaynt Powle departed fro Calays / 
and retourned to ſaynt Omers / and fro
thens to Amyence / where they foūde the kyng
and the quene and their doughter / who ſhulde
be quene of Englande. The ſame tyme there
was the dukes of Bretaygne and of Berrey
in great araye. And the kynge of Englande
and his vncles and other lordes retourned in
to Englande / and their wyues taryed ſtyll at
Calays tyl their retourne. ¶In this meane
ſeaſon the voyage was made in to Freſe / by
them of Haynalte. Fyrſt the erle of Heynalte / 
Holande / and of zelande / and his ſonne the
Erle of Oſtrenaunt / as ye ſhall here after in
this hyſtorie.
         
         
            ¶Howe the erle of Heynalt and the
erle of Oſtrenante his ſonne made a
great army of men of armes knyghtes
and ſquyers to go in to Freſe.
Cap. CC.xiiii.
            
               Ye haue herde here before
howe duke Auberte of Bauyer / 
and Guylliam his ſonne erle of
Oſtrenant / had gret deſyre to go
in to Freſe to conquere that countrey / 
wherof the ſayde duke Aubert by ryght
ſucceſſion of herytage / ſhulde be erle and lorde
therof. and to auaunce the ſame iourney / the
erle of Oſtrenant had ſent Fyerebrace of Vertayne
to haue ſome ayde of the englyſſhe men / 
who ſpedde hym ſo well that kynge Rycharde
of Englande for the honour of his coſyns / ſent
certayne men of armes with two hundred archers / 
vnder the guydyng of thre gentlemen / 
one called Cornewayle / another Colleuyll / 
knyghtes / the thyrde aſquyer / I knowe nat
his name / but I was well enfourmed that he
was a valyaunt man of armes / he hadde his
chynne cutte of in a fray a lytell before / and he
had a chynne made of ſyluer / tyed aboute his
heed with a laſe of ſylke. Theſe englyſſhmen
came to Encuſe at their tyme prefyxed. This
duke A
                  •
               berte and his ſonne had a valyaunt
man of their coūſayle called Gylliam of Croenbourge / 
who greatly exorted theym to the
warre / for he hated greatly the freſones / and
had doone them many dyſpyghtes / and dyd
after / as ye ſhall here. Thus the duke Aubert
departed fro the Haye in Holande with Gyllyam
his ſonne erle of Oſtrenant / and ſo came
in to his countrey of Haynalte / to the towne
of Monts / and there he aſſembled togyther
the thre eſtates of the countrey / and there ſhewed
vnto them the great deſyre that he had to
go in to Freſe / and the rightfull occaſion that
he had ſo to do / and cauſed there to be openly
ſhewed certayne letters patentes apoſtolykes
and imperyalles ryght noble and autentyke / 
ſealed vnder leade lyole and entre / by the whiche
apered euydently the ryght and tytell that
he had to ye ſignory of Freſe / and than he ſayd
openly. Lordes and valyaunt men my ſubgettes / 
ye knowe well that euery man ought to
kepe and defēde his herytage / and that a man
may laufully moue war
                  •
                to recouer his lande

and herytage. ye knowe alſo ye freſons ought
by right to be our ſubgiettes / and they be inobedyent
and rebell agaynſt vs and our ſygnory / 
as people without lawe or faythe. and therfore
good and dere frendes ye know well that
without your ayde / bothe with bodyes and
goodes / we canne nat fournyſſhe to bringe to
execuſyon ſo hygh an enterpriſe / wherfore we
deſyre you in this buſyneſſe to ayde vs / that is
to ſay with money and with men of warre / to
the entent that theſe inobedyent freſons maye
be ſubdued and brought to obedyence. Theſe
wordes or ſuche lyke / ſpoken by the duke / the
thre eſtates by a cōmune acord graūted their
lordes petycyon and requeſt / lyke ſuche people
as greatly deſyred and alwayes had done
to do obedyent ſeruyce and pleaſure to their
lorde and prince. And as I was enfourmed
they cauſed him to haue in redy money mountante
to the ſōme of thyrty thouſande pounde / 
beſyde the towne of Valencēnes / who in lyke
wyſe dyd their deuoyre / and alſo in the towne
of Monts. Theſe thynges thus concluded / 
the valyaunt princes / the good duke Auberte
and Giullyam his ſonne erle of Oſtrenant / ſeynge
the good wylles of his men / was ryght
ioyfull / whiche was no meruayle / for he ſawe
well that he was well beloued with his ſubgiettes / 
and ſhulde be well fournyſſhed with
money. Than he had coūſayle to ſende to the
frenche kyng / and to ſhewe him the enterpriſe
of his voyage / and to deſyre ayde of hym / and
thyder was ſent two valyaunt and wyſe men
that is to ſaye / the lorde Lygne and the lorde
of Ieumont / who were two ryght valyaunt
knyghtes and well beloued with the frenche
men / and ſpecyally the lorde Lygne / the kyng
had made hym one of his chamberlayns / and
had hym in good fauoure / he ſpake with the
kynge and ſhewed hym the dukes entent and
requeſt. to the whiche the kynge and his counſayle
fauourably agreed / & ſpecyally the duke
of Burgoyner / bycauſe his doughter was maryed
to therle of Oſtrenāt / wherby he thought
that in tyme to come after / it ſhulde be to their
profyte / and to their heyres / howe be it many
great lordes and other ſpake of this iourney
in dyuers maners. Some ſayd / to what purpoſe
dothe theſe heyno wayes deſyre the kyng
of ayde / they haue ben in Englande & ſought
for ayde there. Hath nat the erle of Haynalt of
late taken on hym the blewe garter to tye his
legge withall / which is ye ordre in Englande / 
it ſemyth therby he hath no great affectyon to
Fraunce? Than other that were ryght wyſe
anſwered and ſayd. Syr ye do wronge to ſay
thus / though the erle of Oſtrenant haue taken
the ordre of the garter / yet for all that he is nat
alyed with the englyſſhe men / but he is fermly
alyed with Fraunce. Hath nat he in maryage
the lady Katheryne / doughter to the duke of
Burgoyne? whiche is a farre greater alyaūce
than is a garter / therfore neuer ſay but that he
wyll loue and do pleaſure to Fraunce / by reaſon
of his maryage / rather than to Englande
for y• garter / wherfore the kinge ſhall do right
honourably to ayde hym. Thus the frenche
men deuyſed amonge them ſelfe / and ſpake in
dyuers maners / both of that iourney and alſo
of the iourney in to Hungery and in to Turkey / 
agaynſt Lamorabaquy and the turkes.

Than theſe ſayd knyghtes and eſquyers
of Haynalt without any contradictyon acorded
to his deſyre / promyſinge to do hym ſeruyce

retourned agayne / wherfore they feared leſte
it ſhulde hap ſo than to theſe / as it dyd on their
predeceſſours. The ducheſſe of Brabant had
defended all men in the countrey of Brabant / 
no man to be ſo hardy to go oute of the countrey
in that iourney. The ladyes and gentlewomen
of Haynalt deſyred often tymes their
frendes and louers to leaue that iourney / but
they coulde nat lette the mater / howe be it they
were ſore diſpleaſed in their myndes with the
baſterde of Vertayne Fierebraſe / for they ſaid
he was one of the chyefe ſetters on of that buſyneſſe.
Thus after that the duke Aubert and

of his men of Haynalte / than he went in to zelande / 
ſhewynge them his buſyneſſe. and they
aſſented to his requeſt / by the chiefe ſettynge
on of the lorde de la Vere / and ſyr Floris de
Boeſell / Floris / Dabell / the lorde of zenembrige / 
ſyr Clays de Boyſell / Phylyp Corteen
and dyuers other gentlemen. All theſe and other
made them ſelfes redy / in ſuche wyſe that
it apered well by their dylygence / that they
had great deſyre to auaunce them ſelfe to that
iourney.
            IN lyke wyſe the duke and his ſonne
went in to Holande and made there
lyke requeſtes to ye lordes and good
townes / as they had done in zelande. The holanders
were therof ryght ioyouſe / for of all
men they hated the freſons / for they were euer
at warre togyther ſpecyally on the ſee and on
the borders of their countrey / and therfore the
lordes of Holande / ſuche as the lorde Tarterell / 
and dyuers other noble men knyghtes
and ſquyers / herynge the requeſtes of their
lordes duke Aubert and the erle of Oſtrenant
they offered themſelfe / promyſynge comforte
and ayde to the beſt of their powers / and that
they well ſhewed / for incontynent they made
them redy / and auaunced forwarde. In lyke
wiſe dyd the men of the good townes and of

the countrey. They ſent forthe with theſe lordes
a great nombre of croſbowes and moriſpykes / 
and other men of warre. So daylye
men aſembled at the towne of Encuiſe / and
ſhyppes and veſſelles came thyder / in ſuche
wyſe / that the maryners were eſtemed to the
nombre of .xxx. thouſande. It was ſayd that
there came out of the towne of Harle .xii. hū
               dred / 
whiche ſhyppes were well prouyded
of all thynges neceſſary. And of a trouthe / 
if the ladyes and other damoſelles were ſoroufull
in Heynalt / in lykewiſe ſo were they
of Hollande and zelande. Sir Danyell of
Marebbed and Guillyam of Oruenbourge
they durſt nat apere before the ladyes & gentylwomen / 
for they had ſore ſette forwarde
the buſyneſſe / for they hadde great wyll and
deſyre to be reuenged of the Freſons / bicauſe
of a batayle that hadde been there before / 
wherin the Erle Wyllyam was pituouſlye
ſlayne / and loſt .xxxiii. cotes of armes of his
lynage / wherfore theſe two knyghtes wolde
neuer take any treſon to mercy nor raūſome.
So within a certayne ſpace euery man was
come to Encuiſe. Fyrſt came the Englyſſhe
men and than the henous / and their capyten
was the ſeneſchall of Iumont and the lorde
of Comegynes / who was marſhall. Than
came hollanders and zelanders. The frēche
men came nat ſo ſoone. So they taryed a .xi.
dayes for the Frenche men / in whiche ſeaſon
there fell a debate bytwent the hollanders &
the Englyſſhe men / and if the erle of Oſtrenaunt
had nat ben / all the Englyſſhmen had
ben ſlayne. Whiche ſtryfe was apeſed & than
the frenchmen came. Than there was great
ioye made / and cōmaundement gyuen / that
euery man ſhulde entre in to ſuche ſhyppes / 
as they were aſſygned vnto before / whiche
was done. And whan they were all ſhypped
they hoyſed vp ſayles and ſayled forthe. the
wether was fayre / it ſemed as it was diſpoſed
to do thē pleaſure. There were ſo many
ſhippes that if they had bē araynged one after
another / they wolde haue ſtretched fro encuſe
to the boundes of Condren / whiche was
in highe Freſe / where they purpoſed to arryue
(as they dyde) whiche was .xii. leages
by water / but they ſayled a front right ordinatly.
¶Nowe wyll we leaue ſpekyng of
them and ſpeke of the Freſons / who (as I
was enformed) were aduertyſed long before
of duke Aubertes cōmyng / with great puyſſaunce
on them.
            WHan the freſons knewe and vnderſtode
that they ſhulde haue warre / 
all the wyſe men of the countre aſſē
               bled
toguyder / to take counſayle and aduyſe
what they ſhulde do. Whan they had long debated
the mater / their entēcion was to fyght
with their enemyes / as ſoone as they myght
knowe that they were entred in to their countrey / 
ſayeng howe they had rather dye as fre
Freſons / thā to be in ſeruage vnder any kynge
or prince / or vnder ſubiectyon. And therfore
they ſayd / to dye in the quarell they wolde
fight with their enemyes. And concluded
amonge themſelfes / to take no man to raunſome / 
howe great ſoeuer he were. Amonge
them there was one man farre excedynge in
greatneſſe aboue all other. He was hygher
than any other man in that countrey by the
heed. He was called Iuye Iouer / and ſome
called hym the great Freſone. This manne
was greatly commended in Pruce / in Hungery / 
in Turkey / in Rodes / and in Cypres.
He hadde done many noble feates of armes / 
ſo that he was greatlye renomed. Whan̄e he
harde the opynions of ye Freſons / howe they
wolde fight with their enemyes / he aunſwered
and ſayde. ¶O / ye noble and free Freſons / 
knowe for trouthe there is no chaunce
but maye tourne. Though by your valyantneſſe / 
ye haue or this tyme diſcon
                  ••
               ted ye heyno
wayes / the hallanders / and the zelanders.
Knowe for trouthe / that ſuche as come nowe
vpon you / are people more experte in ye warr̄
thanne they were before: And beleue verily / 
they ſhall do otherwyſe than their predeceſſours
dyde. They wyll nat gyue it vp: they
wyll menteyne their dedes. Therfore I wyll
counſayle you to ſufire them to entre / and let
vs kepe our fortereſſes / and lette them kepe
the feldes / where they ſhall beate them ſelfes.
Our countrey is nat to ſuſteyne thē long
We haue many dykes. They canne nat go
farre in the countrey. They canne nat ryde
abrode in the Countrey / and full yuell they
maye go a foote / wherby they ſhalbe ſo werye / 
that they ſhall waſte theym ſelfes / and
ſo retourne agayne. The mooſt they can do
is to brenne a tenne or .xii. vyllages / whiche
ſhall natte greatly greue vs. They ſhall be

ſoone made agayne if we ſhulde fight with
them. I feare me we be nat ſtronge ynough
to fyght with them at ones / for as I am enformed / 
they be to the nombre of an hundred
thouſande armed heedes. Whiche was of a
trouthe / they were as many or mo. To his
wordes conſented thre other knightes of the
Freſons / the fyrſt named ſir Fewe of Dorekerque / 
the ſeconde ſir Gerarde of Canym / 
and the thirde ſir Tiny of Walturge / but the
people wolde in no wyſe conſente to that deuyſe / 
no more wolde other noble men called
the Elyns / that is to ſaye / the gentylmen or
iudges of the cauſes. They replyed ſo with
this great freſon / that he was cōcluded with
them / that as ſoone as they knewe their enemyes
entred in to their countre / they ſhulde
go and fyght with them. They abode all on
that opinyon / and ſo made them ſelfe redy.
But to ſaye the trouthe / they were but poorelye
armed. Many had no armure / but their
cootes of wadmoll / and courſe groſe clothe.
Some armed with lether / and ſome with ruſtye
mayle: and ſome there were ryght well
armed.
            THus they armed theym / and whan
they were redy they wente to their
churches and toke ye croſſes and baners / 
and made thre batayls / and in euery batayle
ten thouſande fyghting men / & came to
a narowe paſſage well viked / nere to ye place
where their enemyes ſhulde lande. and they
ſawe well howe their enemyes were come / &
had great deſyre to take lande / whiche was
on ſaynt Bartylmewes daye on a ſonday / in
the foreſaid yere. And whan ye Freſons ſawe
thē aproche / they iſſued out vpon the dikes a
ſire thouſande / to haue lette the landynge of
their enemyes. Among the freſons ther was
a woman apparelled all in blewe / who all in
a rage / went fro the freſons and came nere to
the heynowes / within the ſhotte of a bowe.
Than ſhe tourned her backe towarde ye hey
nowes and plucked vp her clothes and ſhewed
her bare arſe / cryeng in her langage. 
                  
                     
                  
                  ser
               s
take this to your welcome. As ſoone as they
ſawe the leudneſſe of this woman / they ſhot
at her arowes and quarels / ſo that ſhe was
ſtryken i
                  •
                
               
                  •
               he legges and loynes. The arowes
came flyeng at her as thycke as ſnowe.
Than ſome lepte out of the ſhippes in to the
water / and ran after this folyſſhe woman wt
their ſwerdes and ouertoke her / and hewed
her in to ſmall peces. Thā euery man iſſued
out of their veſſels / and ſo came agaynſt the
freſons / who receyued them right valyantly
and putte them of with longe pykes & longe
ſtaues bounde with yron. To ſaye ye trouthe
in takyng of lande there was many dedes of
armes done on bothe parties / & many ſlayne
and ſore hurte. But biforce of the Engliſſhe
archers and croſ bowes of Heynaulte / Hollande / 
and zelande / They wanne the dyke agaynſt
the freſons / and vpon that dyke they
araynged their baners in good order / taryeng
for their cōpany / their reuke was more
than halfe a myle longe. Than the Freſons
that were putte fro the dykes came to their
cōpany / who were mo than .xxx. thouſande / 
cloſed toguyder in a grounde dyked rounde
aboute with a great depe dyke / and it was
nat ſo farre of / but they myght well ſe their
enemyes / wheee they were raynged on the
fyrſt dyke. Thus they contynued tyll all the
heynowayes were a lande / and all their baggage / 
and certayne tentes reyred vp. There
they reſted them that ſondaye / and the mondaye
aduiſynge the Freſons their enemyes / 
In whiche two dayes dyuers ſcrymiſſhes
were made / and on the Tueſday bothe parties
were redy. Than certayne newe knightes
were made / and it was ordayned to fight
with the freſons. Than they auauuced forewarde
in good order of batayle / and their archers
before them and amonge them / & than
ſowned trumpettes and clarions / and ſo cāe
a fayre paſe to paſſe ouer the dike. Than the
freſons came to defende the paſſage / and the
archers ſhotte agaynſt them fierſly / and the
freſōs couered them ſelfes with targes / and
with the erthe of the dyke that was bytwene
them & their enemyes: Howe be it they were
ſo nere aproched / that certayne of the holanders
entred in to the dyke and made bridges
with ſperes and pykes / and ſo with valyant
corage began to enuade the freſons / who defended
their force right valyantly / and gaue
ſuche ſtrokes againſt them that wolde moūt
vp out of the dyke / that many were ouerthrowen
downe agayne: But the Heynowayes / 
Frenche men / Englyſſhe men / Hollanders / 
and zelanders were ſo well armed / that the
freſons coude do them no dōmage nor hurt / 
but caſt them downe to the grounde. There

were ſuche noble dedes done and atchyued / 
that it were impoſſible to ſhewe it. the newe
made knyghtes dyde nobly their deuoyre / &
the Freſons defended marueylouſly. They
were great and bygge men / but they were yuell
armed: many were barelegged and bare
foted. In this aſſaut the lorde Lygne / the ſeneſhall
of Heynault / and the lorde Iumont / 
and dyuers other / as they wente aboute this
dyke / They founde awaye wherby they paſſed
ouer the dyke / and ſo came on the freſons
with the poyntes of their ſperes / wherof the
Freſons were fore abaſſhed / ſo that dyuers
of them lepte the dyke. So perforce the Freſons
were fayne to opyn and ſparcle abrode
here and there. In this batayle the great freſon
was ſlayne and the other began to flye.
The chaſe was horryble and cruell / for none
was taken to raūſome / and ſpecially the holanders
ſlewe all they myght attayne vnto / 
In ſo moche that ſuche as were taken by the
Heynowes / frenche men / or Englyſſhe men
the hollanders ſlewe them in their handes.
Amonge the hollanders / the lorde Wyllyam
of Oruenbourge and his two ſonnes / Iohn̄
and Henry (who were made knyghtes the
ſame mornyng) acquyted themſelfe maruey
louſly well / and ſlewe many Freſons / for it
ſemed well by them / that they loued but litell
the freſons. Thus finally the Freſons were
diſcōfyted / and the mooſt parte ſlayne in the
felde / but fewe were takenne priſoners / and
caryed to Haye in Hollande / and there were
kepte a long ſeaſon after. The lorde of Cundren
(who was lorde of that coūtrey / where
the felde was) was the mondaye before yelden
to the duke Aubert and his two ſonnes / 
and yet for all that they were in ye felde with
the freſons. The two ſonnes were longe after
with ye duke. After this diſconfyture they
entred in to the countrey of Condren / & toke
townes and fortreſſes / howe be it they cōquered
but lytell / for the Freſons dyde thē great
dōmage by preuy encoūtrynges. And whan
they ſhulde take any priſoners / they wolde
neuer yelde / but fought to the dethe: ſayeng
they had rather dye free Freſons / than to be
vnder the ſubiectyon of any prince or lorde.
If any priſoners were taken / there coude no
raunſome be gotten for them / for their frendes
wolde nat quyte them out / but rather ſuffre
them to dye in priſone. They wolde neuer
quyte none of their people / withoute it
were to delyuer man for man. And if they
ſawe that there were none of their people in
priſone / they wolde ſlee all their enemyes &
take no priſoner. Thus about the ende of .v.
wekes / and that the heynous and other had
taken and beaten downe certayne townes / 
vyllages / and fortreſſes / of no great valure.
The leaſon beganne to waxe colde marueylouſly / 
and rayned nerehāde euery day / and
the ſees full of tempeſtes and wyndes. The
duke Aubert and his ſonne / conſydringe the
ſeaſon / purpoſed to returne in to baſe Freſe / 
fro whens they came / and ſo in to Hollande / 
the more eaſy to paſſe the colde wynter. So
they departed and came to Encuyſe / & there
gaue lycence to euery man to deꝑte / and ſpecially
to the ſtraūgers / and payde thē truely
their wages / and thāked them of their good
ayde and ſeruyce. Thus brake vp the iourney
of Freſe / and had cōquered but lytell all
that ſeaſon. But within two yere after / the
ſayd two noble princes aſſembled agayn the
ſeconde tyme a great armye / and wente in to
Freſe & made a great cōqueſt / and dyd there
many noble dedes of armes / as ye ſhall here
after. But as nowe we ſhall leaue ſpekyng
therof / and declare ye maner of the maryage
of the kynge of Englande to the doughter of
Fraunce.

            ¶Howe the mariage of the kyng of
Englande to the doughter of Frāce
was ordred / and howe the Frenche
kyng delyuered his doughter to the
kynge of Englande in his Tente by
twene Arde & Calys. Cap. CC.xvi.
            YE haue herde / howe the kyng
of Englande was returned fro Calis
in to Englande / & there was tyll
Michelmas that the ꝑlyament at Weſtmynſter
ſhulde begyn. And in the meane ſeaſon
great prouiſion was made at Calais and at
Guyſnes / for the kynge and for other lordes
ſent fro the portes of Englande on that coſt / 
and great prouiſyon was had out of Flaunders / 
all came by ſee to Calais. In lykewiſe

for the Frenche kyng and for his brother the
duke of Orlyaunce / and his vncles / & other
prelates and lordes of Fraunce / great prouiſyon
was made at ſaynt Omers / at Ayre / at
Tyrwyn / at Arde / at Mountoyre / and at all
other houſes and abbeyes there about. there
was nothynge ſpared on bothe parties / and
ſpecially the abbey of ſaynte Bertyne was
well replenyſſhed of all thynges to receyue
theſe kynges. This ꝑlyament at Weſtmynſter
began at Mychelmas / and it was ordeyned
to endure .xl. dayes. But it was abridged / 
for the king wolde nat tary there but .v.
dayes / wherin he declared the thynges moſt
neceſſary parteyning to the realme / and ſpecially
that mater that touched hym ſelfe / and
the cauſe why he cāe fro Calais. That done
he retourned towardes Calais agayne / and
with hym his two vncles of Lancaſtre and
Glouceſtre / and other prelates and lordes of
Englande / ſuche as were cōmaunded to go
with him. They ſpedde them ſo in their iourney
that they came agayne to Calays. The
duke of yorke taryed ſtyll in Englande and
the erle of Derby / to gouerne the realme in
the kynges abſence. Whan the kyng of Englande
was thus returned to Calais / the lordes
of Fraunce beyng in Picardy were aduertiſed
therof. Than the duke of Burgoyn
and the ducheſſe his wyfe came to ſaynt Omers / 
and were lodged in the abbey of ſaynt
Bertyne. As ſone as the Frēche kyng knewe
that the kynge of Englande was come agayne
to Calais / he ſente to hym therle of ſaynt
Poule / to ſhewe hym what order was taken
in Fraunce / concernyng his maryage / whiche
the kynge of Englande was gladde to
here. Than̄e the duke of Lancaſtre and his
ſonne Beauforde of Lancaſtre. The duke of
Glouceſter and Affren his ſonne / the erle of
Rutlande / the erle maſhall erle of Huntyngton / 
the kynges chamberleyne / and many other
lordes / knyghtes / ſquyers / and ladyes
rode with the Erle of ſaynt Poule to ſaynt
Omers / where they were well receyued of
the duke of Burgoyne and of the ducheſſe / 
and thyder came the duke of Bretaigne / and
had lefte the Frenche kynge at Ayre and his
doughter with hym.
            ye maye well knowe / all the chere yt coude
be deuyſed / was made to the Englyſſhe lordes
and ladyes and other at ſaynt Omers / 
and the ducheſſe of Burgoyne made them a
great dyner. There was the ducheſſe of Lā
               caſtre
and her ſonne & two doughters. there
was great gyftes gyuen of plate of Golde
and ſyluer nothynge was ſpared / in ſo moche
that the Englyſſhe men hadde marueyle
therof / and ſpecially the duke of Gloceſtre / &
ſayd to his coūſayle. I ſe well there is great
rycheſſe in the realme of Fraunce. there was
moche gyuen to hym / to the entente to abate
and to molyfie his rancour that he hadde agaynſte
Fraunce. The lordes of Fraunce
knewe well that he was alwayes harde to agre
to the peace / wherfore they ſhewed hym
as moche token of loue and honour as they
coude do. He toke euer all their gyftes / but
alwayes the rancour abode ſtyll in his hert / 
for all that euer the Frenche men coulde do / 
they coulde nat molifye his fell ſtomake / for
always he made herde anſwers as they treated
for any peace. The Frenche men be ſubtyle / 
yet for all that they coude gette no hold
of hym / for his wordes and aunſwers were
alwayes ſo couert / that they wyſt nat howe
to vnderſtāde them. Whan the duke of Burgoyne
ſawe his maner he ſayde to his counſayle.
We leſe all that euer we do to this duke
of Glouceſtour / for as longe as he lyueth
there ſhalbe no ſure peace bytwene Fraūce
and Englande. For he ſhall alwayes fynde
newe inuencyons and accydentes / to engender
hate and ſtryfe bytwene bothe realmes / 
for he entēdeth nor thynketh none other thynge.
If it were nat the truſte that we haue in
the kyng of Englande / wherby here after to
fare the better / the kyng ſhulde nat haue to
his wyfe our coſyn of Fraunce.
            WHan the duke and ducheſſe of Burgoyne / 
the coūteſſe of Neuers / the
counteſſe of ſaynt Poule / and the
other lordes and ladyes of Fraunce / hadde
greatly feeſted the lordes and ladyes of Englande / 
than there was cōmunicacion howe
theſe two kynges ſhulde mete & ſpeke toguyder / 
and howe the lady ſhulde be delyuered / 
thervpon apoyntment was made / and leaue
taken on all partes. The Englyſſhe ꝑtie returned
to Calis to the kyng / & ſhewed what
chere they had / and what preſentes had ben
gyuen them. Theſe newes pleaſed well the

kyng / for he was gladde whan he herde any
honour ſpoken of the Frenche kyng / he was
ſo in loue with hym bycauſe of his doughter / 
whome he truſted to haue to his Quene.
Than anone after the Frenche kyng came to
ſaynt Omers / and was lodged in the abbey
of ſaynt Bertyne / and diſlodged all other
that were there before / and had the duke of
Bretayne in his company. And than it was
ordayned that the dukes of Berrey / of Burgoyne / 
and of Burbone ſhulde go to Calis
to ſpeke with the kynge of Englande.
            SO they came to Calays / and were
ioyouſlye receyued / & had as good
chere as coulde be deuyſed. Theſe
thre dukes had ſecrete communycacion with
the kynge and his counſayle / ſo that many / 
bothe of Fraunce and of Englande reputed
that there was a peace concluded bytwene
Fraunce and Englande. And in dede it was
nere at a poynt / and the duke of Glouceſter
agreed well therto / as at that tyme. For the
kyng of Englande hadde promyſed hym / if
he wolde agree to the peace / to gyue his ſon
Affren the erldome of Rocheſter in herytaū
               ce / 
and to make hym ſpende yerely in reuenewes
two thouſande pounde ſterlyng / and
to gyue to hym ſelfe as ſoone as he came in
Englande in redy money fyftie thouſande
nobles / ſo that by reaſon of theſe gyftes / the
duke of Glouceſtours hardneſſe was well
aleyed. So that the lordes of Fraunce ſawe
well his opinyons were nat ſo obſtynate as
they were before / for they founde hym than
ſwete and meke. Whan̄e euery thynge was
ordeygned of that they came for / they tooke
leaue of the kynge and other / and retourned
to ſaynt Omers to the Frenche kynge / and
ſhewed howe they hadde ſpedde. Than the
Frenche kyng wente to the baſtyde of Arde
and the duke of Burgoyne to Mountoyre / 
and the duke of Bretaygne to the towne of
Eſque / and the duke of Berrey to Balyngham.
And in euery ꝑte all aboute there were
pyght vp Tentes and Pauilyons / and all
the countrey full of people / what of Fraūce
and of Englande. The kynge of Englande
came to Guyſnes and the duke of Lancaſtre
with hym / and the duke of Glouceſtre to Hā
               mes.
Thus on a Fridaye beyng the euyn of
Symon and Iude / in the yere of oure lorde
god / a thouſande thre hundred fourſcore and
ſixtene / about tenne of the clocke in the forenoone.
The two Kynges departed oute of
their tentes / the which were pyght nat farre
aſondre / and came a foote the one to ye other
and met at a certayne place that was apoynted.
And on the one ſyde there was araynged
four hundred knyghtes of Fraunce / armed
with their ſwerdes in their hādes / And
on the other parte foure hundred Englyſſhe
knyghtes in lyke maner. So the two kynges
paſſed through them. The dukes of Lā
               caſtre
and of Glouceſtre ledde the Frenche
kynge / and the dukes of Berrey and of Burgoyne
ledde the kynge of Englande. Thus
they came foreby the ſayd eight hundred knightes.
And whan the two kynges came iuſt
toguyder / all the eyght hundred knyghtes
kneled downe to the grounde / and many of
them wepte for ioye. Thus the two kynges
mette toguyder bareheeded / and a lytell enclyned
and tooke eche other by the handes.
Than the Frenche kynge ledde the kynge of
Englande in to his tente / whiche was noble
and ryche / and the four dukes tooke eche other
by the handes and folowed the two kynges.
And other knyghtes after the Frenche
men on the one ſyde / and the Englyſſhe men
on the other ſyde: And ſo they ſtode regardyng
eche other in good and humble maner
tyll all was done. Than̄e it was ordayned / 
that on the ſame place where as the two kynges
tooke eche other by the hande / that there
ſhulde be made and founded a chapell in the
honoure of our Lady / and ſhulde be called
our lady of Grace. I can nat tell whether it
were made or nat.
            
               SO the two kynges hande in hā
               de
entred in to the Frenche kynges
tente. Than the foure dukes
kneled downe before ye kynges
and they reyſed them vp / &
ſo talked toguyder. Than the two kynges
wente a lytell a parte / and talked a certayne
ſpace. In the meane tyme wyne and ſpyces
were brought. The duke of Berrey ſerued
the Frenche kynge of ſpyce / and the duke of
Burgoyne of wyne. And the dukes of Lācaſtre
& Gloceſter ſerued the kyng of Englād.
thā other knightes & ſquiers ſerued all other
prelates & lordes / ſo yt euery man wtin ye tent

done and paſte / the two kynges tooke leaue
eche of other / and ſo retourned to their tentes / 
and tooke their horſes and rode towardes
Calais. The kyng to Guyſnes / the dukes

and the other to Calais. The Frenche kyng
rode to Cordre and the duke of Orlyaunce
with hym / the duke of Berrey to Dornam / 
and the duke of Burgoyne to Mountoyre.
So there was no more done that daye / all
their tentes ſtode ſtyll in the feldes.
            THan on the Saturdaye on the feeſt
of ſaynt Symon and Iude / aboute
a .xi. of the clocke / the kynge of Englande
and his vncles / and other lordes cāe
to the Frenche kyng in to his tent. they were
receyued right honorably / and euery manne
talked with his felowe merily. Than tables
were ſette vp / and the two kynges ſat at one
table alone / the Frenche kynge on the ryght
hande. The dukes of Berrey / of Burgoyne
and of Burbone ſerued the two kynges. thā
the duke of Burbone caſte forthe many ieſtyng
wordes to make the kynges to laughe
and ſuche as were before the table / For this
duke was a mery man / and ſayd openly / addreſſynge
his wordes to the kynge of Englāde.
Sir quod he / ye ought to make good
chere / for ye haue all that ye deſyre / ye haue
your wife or ſhall haue her deliuered to you
Than the Frenche kyng ſayd / Burbonoys.
We wolde that our doughter were of ye age
that our coſyn of ſaynt Poule is / on the condicyon
that it coſt me a great good / than ſhe
ſhulde take my ſonne with the better good
wyll. The kynge of Englande herde well
thoſe wordes / and anſwered ſpekyng to the
duke of Burbone (bycauſe the Frēche kyng
hadde compared his doughter / to the erle of
ſaynt Poules doughter) and ſayd. Sir / the
age that my wyfe (that ſhall be) is of / pleaſeth
you right well / we loue nat ſo moche her
herytage / than I do the loue of you & of our
realmes / For we two beyng of one accorde / 
there is no kynge chriſten nor other / that are
able to anoye vs.
            This dyner thus done in the Frenche kynges
tent / and after wyne and ſpyces taken / 
than the yonge quene was brought forthe / a
companyed with a great nombre of ladyes
and damoſelles / and there ſhe was delyuered
to the kyng of Englande. Whan yt was
done / euery man toke their leaue to departe.
The yonge quene was ſette in a ryche lytter
and there wente no mo frenche ladyes with
her / but the lady of Coucy. There were the
ladyes of Englande / the ducheſſes of Lancaſtre / 
of yorke / and of Glouceſtre / & of Irelande / 
the lady of Namure / & the lady Poynynges / 
and a great nombre of other ladies / 
who receyued the quene with great ioye.
            Thus the kyng of Englande and the yonge
quene and his company / rode to Calais the
ſame nyght / and the frenche kyng and his cō
               pany
to ſaynt Omers. Than the Tueſdaye
after whiche was Alhalowen day / the kyng
of Englande maryed the ſayd lady Iſabell
of Fraūce / in the churche of ſaynt Nicholas
in Calais / the archebyſſhop of Caūterbury
wedded theym / at whiche tyme there was a
great feeſt and great largeſſe. The Thurſdaye
after there came to Calais the dukes of
Orlyaunce and of Burbone / to ſe the kynge
and the quene: And on the friday they tooke
their leaue and departed / and rode to ſaynt
Omers to the Frenche kyng. And the ſame
day in the mornyng / the kyng and the quene
toke their ſhyppe and hadde fayre paſſage / 
they were ouer within thre houres. the kynge
laye in the caſtell of Douer / and the nexte
daye to Rocheſtre & than to Dartforde / and
ſo to Eltham. Than̄e all lordes and ladyes
toke their leaue / and a fiftene dayes after the
quene was brought to the cytie of London / 
accompanyed with many lordes / ladyes and
damoſels / & laye the fyrſt night at the towre
of London / and the nexte day cōueyed along
throughe the cytie with great ſolempnyte to
the kynges palais of Weſtmynſter / and ther
the kyng was before redy to receyue her. the
ſame daye the londoners gaue to the quene
great preſentes. Than was there ordayned
a great iuſtes to be holden in the cytie of Lō
               don / 
of .xl. knyghtes and ſquyers chalēgers / 
to be holden at Candelmas nexte after / whiche
was delyuered to the Herauldes to publyſſhe
on bothe ſydes of the realme to Scotlande.
And whan the Frenche kyng was cōe
to Parys after the maryage of his doughter
and euery lorde departed home / there ranne

than a great brute through the realme / howe
the frenche kyng was in purpoſe at the begynnynge
of Marche / to go with a great army in
to Lombardy / to dyſtroye the lorde Galeas
duke of Mylayne / the kyng had ſuche diſpleaſure
agaynſt hym that no man coulde tourne
hym but that he wolde make that voyage / and
the kyng of Englande had promyſed to ſende
hym ſyxe thouſande archers. And the duke of
Bretaygne had offered to go with hym with
two thouſande ſpeares bretons. Great prouyſyon
was made for this iourney in the Dolphenry
of Vyen / and in the countie of Sauoy.
Whan the duke of Bretayne departed fro
the frenche kynge to retourne in to his countrey / 
ſyr Peter of Craon who was condempned
to paye to the quene of Iheruſalem a hundred
thouſande frankes / and was in priſon in
the caſtell of Loure in Parys. At the requeſt
of the duke of Bretaygne / the duke of Burgoyne
dyd ſo moche to the kynge / that by his
good meanes the duke of Bretaygne had ſyr
Peter of Craon with hym. I thynke he promyſed
to pay the ſayd ſōme at certayne dayes
to the foreſayd quene. I wyll nowe leaue this

            ¶Howe the ſiege before Nycopoly
in Turkey was reyſed by Lamorabaquy / 
and howe the Frenche men
were dyſcomfyted / & howe the hungaryons
fled. Cap. CC .xvii.
            
               YE haue herde here before
howe the kynge of Hungery and
the lordes of Fraunce were paſſed
the ryuer of Dunce / and were
entred in to Turkey / and all the
ſōmer after the moneth of Iuly they had done
many enterpriſes / and had brought dyuers
townes to their ſubiection / for there was none
that reſyſted them / and had beſieged ye towne
of Nycopoly / and hadde nere brought it to a
ſmall eſtate / nigh redy to yelde / for they coude
here no newes of Lamorabaquy. Than the
kyng of Hungery ſaid to the lordes of Fraūce
and to other. Syrs thanked be god we haue
had a fayre ſeaſone / we haue dyſtroyed parte
of Turkey / I reken this towne of Nycopolyours
whan we lyſt. it is ſo ſore ouerlayde that
it canne nat longe holde / wherfore all thynges
conſydred I coūſayle (this towne ones won)
that we go no further at this ſeaſon / we ſhall
drawe agayn ouer the Dunce in to the realme
of Hungery / where I haue many cyties / townes / 
and caſtelles redy furnyſſhed to receyue
you / as reaſon is / ſeyng ye be come ſo farre to
ayde me to make warre agaynſt the turkes / 
whome I haue founde herde and cruell enemyes / 
and this wynter we ſhall make newe
prouyſion agaynſt the next ſomer / and ſende
worde to the frenche kyng what caſe we be in / 
ſo that this nexte ſōmer he maye refreſſhe vs
with newe men / and I beleue whan he knoweth
what we haue done & howe euery thyng
ſtandeth / he wyll haue great affection to come
hyther in his owne perſon / for he is yonge and
couragyous / and loueth dedes of armes. and
whether he cometh or nat / by the grace of god
this next ſōmer / we ſhall wynne the realme of
Armony / and paſſe the braſe of ſaynt George / 
and ſo in to Surrey / and wynne the portes of
Iaphes and Baruth / and conquere Iheruſalem
and all the holy lande. and if the ſowdan
come forewarde we ſhall fyght with hym / for
he ſhall nat departe without batayle.
            THeſe or lyke wordes ſayd the kynge
of Hungery to the lordes of Fraunce
& rekened Nycopoly as their owne / 
howe be it fortune fell otherwyſe. All that ſeaſon
the kynge Baſaach called Lamorabaquy
had reyſed an army of ſarazyns / ſome out of
farre countreys / as out of Perce. many great
men of the ſarazyns came to ayde Lamorabaquy
to dyſtroy cryſtendome. They were paſſed
the Braſe ſaynt George to the nombre of
two hūdred thouſande men. To ſay the trouth
the chryſten men were nat a certayned what
nombre they were of. This kynge Baſaache
and his men aproched nere to Nycopoly by
couerte wayes / they knewe in feates of warre
as moche as myght be / and this kynge was a
valyaunt man / whiche ſhewed well by reaſon
of his polycy / he ordered his bataylles thus.
All his hooſt was in a maner as wynges / his
men compriſed well a great myle of grounde / 
and before the hooſt to ſhewe a face redye in
a bande an eyght thouſande turkes / the two
wynges of the batayle were open a forefronte

and narowe behynde/and Lamorabaquy was
in the herte of the batayle / thus they rode all
in couerte. Theſe eyght thouſande Turkes
were ordeyned to make a face / and yt as ſone
as they ſhulde ſe the cryſten men a ꝓche / than
they to recule lytell and lytell in to the herte of
the batayle / and than the two wynges whiche
were open before (the cryſten men beyng ones
entred bytwene theym) to cloſe togyther and
ioyne in to one company / and than to fyght
with their enemyes. This was the ordre of
their batayle.
            THus in the yere of oure lorde god a
thouſande thre hūdred fourſcore and
ſyxtene / the monday before the feeſt
of ſaynt mychell about ten of the clocke / as the
kyng of Hungery ſate at dyner at the ſiege of
Nycopoly / tydynges came to the hooſt howe
the turkes were comyng and the ſcoutes that
came in ſhewed howe they had ſene the turkes / 
but their reporte was nat trewe / for they
had nat tydden ſo forwarde / that they had auewed
the two wynges / nor the batayle behynde / 
they had ſene no mo but ye fore ryders
and bowarde / for as ſoone as they had ſene
theym they retourned. The ſame ſeaſone the
greateſt parte of ye hoſt were at dyner. Than
tydynges was brought to the erle of Neuers / 
and to all other ingenerall by their ſcurers / 
who ſaid. Syrs arme you quyckly that ye be
nat ſurpriſed / for the turkes are comynge on
you. Theſe tydynges greatly reioyſed the cryſten
men / ſuche as deſyred to do dedes of armes.
Than euery man roſe fro their dynners
and put the tables fro them / and demaunded
for their harneſſe and horſes / and they were
well chafed before with drynkynge of wyne.
Than euery man drewe in to the felde / baners
and ſtanderdes dyſplayed / euery man to his
owne baner. Than the baner of our lady was
dyſplayed / therwith the valyaunt knyght ſir
Iohan of Vien admyrall of Fraunce / and the
frenche men were the fyrſt that drewe in to the
felde freſſhely aparelled / makynge ſmall accompte
of the turkes / but they knewe nat that
they were ſo great a nombre as they were / nor
that Lamorabaquy was there in his owne
perſone. As theſe lordes of Fraunce were into
the felde / there came vnto theym the kynge of
Hungeryes marſhall in great haſt / who was
a valyaunte knyght / called Henry of Oſtenlenyhall / 
vpon a good horſe with a penon of
his armes / of ſyluer a croſſe ſable ancored / called
in armure / the yron of a mylſtone. Whan
he came before the baner of our lady he ſtode
ſtyll / and (to the moſte parte of the barones of
Fraunce) he ſayd openly. Syrs I am ſent hyther
to you fro the kynge of Hungery / and he
deſireth you by me / that ye ſat nat on your enemyes
vntyll ſuche tyme as ye haue worde agayne
fro him / for it ought to be doughted leſt
our ſcoutes haue nat brought the certaynte of
the nombre of the turkes / but within theſe two
houres ye ſhall here other tydynges / for we
haue ſent other foreryders forth to auewe our
enemyes more ſubſtancially than the firſt dyd
and ſyrs ye maye be ſure the turkes ſhall nat
indomage vs / if ye tary tyll all our hole puyſſaunce
be togyder. Syrs this is the ordre that
the kynge and his counſayle hath ordered / I
muſte retourne agayne to the kynge. Whan he
was deꝑted the french lordes aſſembled thē togyder / 
to knowe what was beſt for them to do.
Than it was demaunded of the lorde Coucy
what he thought beſt to be done / he anſwered
and ſaid. I wolde counſayle to obey the kyng
of Hungeryes cōmaundement / for that ordre
ſemeth to be good. And as it was enfourmed
me ſyr Phylippe of Arthoys erle of Ewe and
conſtable of Fraunce / was nat contented that
the aduyſe had nat fyrſt haue ben demaunded
of hym. Than he for pride and diſpyght helde
the contrary opynyon / and ſayd. ye ſyr ye / the
kynge of Hungery wolde haue the floure and
chiefe honour of this iourney / we haue the vowarde / 
he hath graunted it to vs / and nowe he
wolde take it fro vs agayne / beleue hym who
wyll for I do nat / & than he ſayd to the knyght
that bare his banner / in the name of god and
ſaynt George / ye ſhall ſeme this daye a good
knyght. Whan the lorde Coucy herde the conſtable
ſpeke theſe wordes / he toke it done of a
great preſumpcyon. Than he loked on ſyr Iohan
of Vyen / who bare the ſtandarde of our
lady / and demaūded of hym what he thought
beſt to be doone. Syr quod he where as wyſe
reaſone canne nat be herde / than pride muſte
reygne / and ſythe that the erle of Ewe wyll nedes
ſet on / we muſt nedes folowe / howe be it
we ſhulde be the ſtronger and if our puyſſaūce
were hole togyther. Thus as they deuyſed in
the felde / ſtyll the turkes aproched / & the two
wynges eche of .lx. thouſande men beganne

to aproche and to cloſe / and had the chryſten
men bytwene them / ſo that if they wolde haue
reculed they coulde nat / for they were cloſed in
with the ſarazyns / the wynges were ſo thicke.
Than dyuers knyghtes that were well expert
in armes / ſawe well the iourney ſhulde be agaynſt
them / howe be it they auaunced and folowed
the baner of our lady / borne by the valyaunt
knight ſyr Iohn̄ of Vien. Euery knyght
of Fraunce was in his cote armure that euery
man ſemed to be a kinge / they were ſo freſſhly
aparelled. As it was ſhewed me whan they began
fyrſte to fyght with the turkes / they were
nat paſt a ſeuen hundred men. Lo beholde the
great foly and outrage / for if they had taryed
for the kynge of Hungery who were threſcore
thouſande men / they had been lykely to haue
doone a great acte / and by them and by their
pride all was loſt / and they receyued ſuche dō
               mage / 
that ſythe the batayle of Rounſeualx / 
where as the .xii. peres of Fraūce were ſlayne
cryſtendome receyued nat ſo great a dōmage
howe be it or they were dyſcomfyted a great
nombre of turkes were ſlayne / for the frenche
men dyſcomfyted the fyrſt batayle of the turkes / 
and had them in chaſe tyll they came in to
a valey / where Lamorabaquy was with his
hole puyſſaunce. Than the frenchmen wolde
haue retourned to their hooſt / but they coulde
nat / for they were cloſed in on all partes. there
was a ſore batayle / the frenche men endured
longe. Than newes came to the kyng of Hungery
howe the frenche men / englyſſhmen / and
almayns were fyghtyng with the turkes / and
had broken his cōmaundement and counſayle
gyuen thē by his marſhall / wherwith he was
ſore dyſpleaſed / and nat without good cauſe.
Than he ſawe well howe he was lykely to leſe
that iourney / Than he ſaid to the great mayſter
of the Rodes / who was by hym. Syr we
ſhall this day leſe the iourney by reaſon of the
pride of the frenchmen / for if they wolde haue
beleued me / we had been ſtronge ynough to
haue fought with our enemyes. and therwith
the kynge of Hungerye loked behynde hym / 
and ſawe howe his men fled a waye and were
diſcomfyted in them ſelfe. Than he ſawe well
there was no recouery / and ſuche as were aboute
hym cryed and ſayd. Saue your ſelfe / 
for if ye be ſlayne all Hungery is loſte / ye ſhall
leſe the felde this daye / by reaſon of the pride
of the frenche men / their valyaūtneſſe turneth
to folyſſh hardynes / for they ſhall be all ſlayne
or taken / none is lykely to ſcape / therfore ſyr if
ye beleue vs ſaue youre ſelfe / and ſcape this
daunger.
            THe kynge of Hungery was ſore dyſpleaſed
whan he ſawe howe he had
loſt ye iourney by dyſorderyng of the
frenche men / and ſawe no remedy but to flye
or els be taken or ſlayne. Great murder there
was / for in flyenge they were chaſed and ſo
ſlayne. They of Hungery fledde without ordre / 
and the turkes chaſed theym / howe be it
god ayded the kinge of Hūgery and the great
mayſter of the Rodes / for they came to the ryuer
of Dunce / and founde there a lytell barge
parteynynge to the Rodes / they entered in to
it but with ſeuen perſones / and ſo went of the
ſhore / or els they had been ſlayne or taken / for
the turkes came to the Ryuer ſyde / and there
ſlewe many a cryſten man / ſuche as had folowed
the kynge to ſaue them ſelfe.
            NOwe lette vs ſpeke of the frenche men
and almayns who fought valyauntly.
Whan the lorde of Mount caurell a ryght valyaunt
knyght of Arthoys ſawe that the dyſcomfyture
ranne vpon them / he had by hym a
ſonne of his a yonge man / than he ſayde to a
ſquyer of his. Take here my ſonne and leade
hym away by yonder wynge whiche is open
and ſaue hym / & I wyll abyde the aduenture
with other of my felowes. Whan the chylde
herde his father ſay ſo / he ſayd howe he wolde
nat departe / but the father dyd ſo moche that
perforce the ſquyer led hym away out of parell
and came to the ryuer of Dunce / but there
the chylde had ſuche care for his father that he
tooke ſmall regarde to hym ſelfe / ſo that he fell
in to ye ryuer bytwene two barges / and there
was drowned without remedy. Alſo ſyr Wyllyam
of Tremoyle fought in that batayle valyauntly / 
and there was ſlayne and his ſonne
by him / and ſyr Iohan of Vyen bearynge the
baner of our lady was ſlayne / and the baner
in his handes. Thus all the lordes and knightes
of Fraūce that were there were diſtroyed / 
by the maner / as ye haue herde. Syr Iohan
of Burgoyne erle of Neuers / was ſo rychely
beſene / and in lykewyſe ſo was ſyr Guy de la
Ryuer / and dyuers other lordes and knyghtes
of Burgoyne / that they were taken priſoners

And there were two ſquiers of Picardy
ryght valyaunt men / called Gyllyam Dewe / 
and the Bourge of Maytequell / theſe two by
valyauntneſſe two tymes paſſed through the
felde / and euer retourned in agayne and dyd
marueyls / but fynally ſhere they were ſlayne.
To ſay the trouthe the frenche men and other
ſtraūgers that were there acquyted them ſelfe
valyauntly / but the frenchmens pride loſt all.
There was a knyght of Pycardy called ſyr
Iaques of Helley / who had dwelte before in
Turkey / and had ſerued Lamorabaquy / and
coude ſomwhat ſpeke the langage of Turkey
whan he ſawe the batayle loſte he yelded hym
ſelfe / and the Sarazyns who are couetous of
golde and ſyluer toke and ſaued hym. Alſo a
lquyer of Tornaſys called Iaques du Fay / 
who had before ſerued the kynge of Tartary
called Tauburyn / as ſoone as this Iaques
knewe yt the frenche men came to make warre
in Turkey / he toke leaue of the kynge of Tartary
and departed / and was on the ſayd felde / 
and taken priſoner by the kyng of Tartaries
men / who were there in the ayde of Lamorabaquy / 
for kynge Tauburyn of Tartary had
ſent to hym great nombre of men of warre.
            THe frenchmen were ſo richely arayed
that they ſemed lyke kynges / wherby
they were taken and their lyues ſaued / 
for ſarazyns & turkes are couetous / they
truſted to haue great raunſomes of theſe that
were taken / and reputed them greater lordes
than they were. Sir Iohan of Burgoyn erle
of Neuers was taken priſoner. In lykewyſe
were the erles of Ewe and de la Marche / the
lorde Coucy / ſyr Henry of Bare / ſyr Guy de
la Tremoyle / Bouciquant and dyuers other.
And ſyr Philyp of Bare / ſyr Iohan of Vyen / 
Willyam of Tremoyle and his ſonne ſlayne / 
and dyuers other. This batayle endured thre
houres fyghtynge / and the kinge of Hungery
loſt all his baggage and all his plate and iowelles / 
and was gladde to ſaue hym ſelfe / but
with ſeuen perſons with him in a lytell barge
of the Rodes / els he had been taken or ſlayne
without recouery. There were mo men
ſlayne in the chaſe than in the batayle / 
and many drowned / 
happy was he that might
ſcape by any maner
of meanes.
            WHan this dyſcomfyture was doone
and paſſed / and that the turkes ſuche
as were ſent thyder by the Sowdan
were withdrawen in to their lodginges / whiche
was in to tentes and pauylyons that they
had conquered / whiche they founde well replenyſſhed
with wyne and meate redy dreſſed / 
wherwith they refreſſhed them / and made ioy
and reuell / lyke ſuche people as had ateygned
vyctorye on their enemyes. Than Lamorabaquy
with a greate nombre of mynſtrelles
acordyng to the vſage of their countrey / came
to the kynge of Hungeryes chefe tent / whiche
was goodly aparelled and hanged with riche
ſtuffe / and there he toke great pleaſure / and
glorifyed in his herte of the wynnyng of that
iourney / and ſhanked their god acordynge to
their lawe. Than he vnarmed hym / and to refreſſhe
hym he ſate downe on a tapyte of ſylke
and cauſed all his great lordes to come to him
to iangle and to talke with them. He made as
great myrthe as myght be / and ſayd howe he
wolde ſhortely with great puyſſaunce paſſe
in to the realme of Hungery / and cōquere the
countrey / and after other countreys vpon the
cryſten men / and to bringe them to his obeyſaunce / 
for he ſayd he was content that euery
man ſhulde lyue after their owne lawes / he deſyred
nothynge but the ſignory / but he ſayd he
wolde reygne lyke Alyſaunder of Maſydone
who was twelue yere kynge of all the worlde / 
of whoſe lynage he ſayde he was dyſcended.
All yt herde him agreed to his ſayenge. Than
he madethre cōmaundemētes. The fyrſt was
that who ſo euer had any priſoner cryſten / to
bringe hym forthe the ſeconde daye after in to
his preſence. the ſeconde was that all the deed
bodyes ſhulde be vyſyted and ſertched / and
ſuch as were likely to be noble men to be layde
aparte by them ſelfe in their raymentes tyll
he came thyder hym ſelfe / for he ſayd he wolde
ſe them. The thyrde was to enquyre iuſtely if
the kyng of Hungery were deed or a lyue. All
was done as he cōmaunded.
            WHan Lamorabaquy had well refreſſhed
hym / than to paſſe the tyme he
went to ye place where the felde was / 
to ſe the deed bodyes / for it was ſhewed hym
that he had many of this men ſlayne / and that
the batayle had coſt hym greatly / of the which
he had great marueyle / and coulde nat byleue

it. Than he mounted on his horſe and a great
nombre with him / he had with hym two of his
bretherne called Baſaache and Surbaſaach / 
as ſome people ſayd / but he wolde nat be knowen
of them / for he ſayd he had no bretherne.
Whan he came to the place where the batayle
was / he founde it of trouthe that there were
many deed and ſlayne / he ſawe yt for one cryſten
man deed / he founde .xxx. turkes ſlayne / 
wherwith he was marueylouſly dyſpleaſed / 
and openly ſayde. Here hath been a cruell batayle
and marueylouſſly defended of the cryſten
men / but I ſhal make them that be a lyue
to bye it derely. Than the kynge went to his
lodgynge / and ſo paſſed that nyght in great
furour of hert / and in the mornyng or he was
vp moche people came to his tente to knowe
what they ſhulde do with the chryſten priſoners / 
the renome ranne that they ſhulde all be
put to dethe without mercy. Lamorabaquy
(for all his dyſpleaſure) ordeyned that ſuche
cryſten men as were in the batayle in great a
ray / and lykely to be great men / ſhulde be all
ſette togyther in one parte / for it was ſhewed
hym that they myght well pay great raunſomes.
Alſo there were dyuers ſarazyns and panyms / 
of Perce / of Tartary / of Arabye / and
ſuryens that had many priſoners / by whome
they thought to haue great aduauntage / as
they had in dede / they hyd them out of the way
ſo that they came nat to knowledge. Amonge
other ſyr Iaques of Helley was brought before
Lamorabaquy / he that had him durſt nat
hyde hym no lenger. Syr Iaques de Helley
was beknowen with ſome of the kynges ſeruaūtes / 
who toke hym fro them that had him / 
whiche was happy for hym / as ye ſhall here
after / for many cryſten men were afterwarde
cruelly ſlayne and put to dethe.
            Kynge Baſaach had cōmaunded to enquyre
whiche were the greateſt of the
cryſten men / and that they ſhulde be
ſet a ſyde / to the entent to ſaue their lyues. So
they were tryed out and ſet a parte. Fyrſt the
lorde Iohan of Burgoyne Erle of Neuers / 
who was chiefe aboue all other / and than ſyr
Phylyppe of Arthoys erle of Ewe / the erle of
Marche / the lorde Coucy / ſyr Henry of Bare
ſyr Guy of Tremoyle / and other to the nombre
of eyght perſones. And Lamorabaquy
went to ſe and to ſpeke with them / and beheld
them a longe ſeaſone / and he coniured theſe
lordes by their faythe and lawe / to ſaye the
trouthe / if they were the perſones that
they named them ſelfe for / and they ſayde ye.
And yet to knowe the more certaynte he ſente
to them the frenche knyght ſyr Iaques of Helley / 
to knowe them / for he had ſerued Lamorabaquy
before / therfore he had his lyfe graū
               ted
hym. He was demaunded if he knewe the
frenche knyghtes pryſoners. He aunſwered
and ſaid / I thynke if Iſe them I ſhall knowe
them. Than he was cōmaunded to go and auewe
theym / and to ſhewe playnely their names.
He dyd as he was cōmaūded / and whan
he came to them / he ſhewed them his aduenture / 
and howe he was ſente thyder to knowe
ſurely their names. Than they ſayde. Ah ſyr
Iaques / ye knowe vs all / and ye ſe well howe
fortune is agaynſt vs / and how we be in daunger
of this kynge / therfore to ſaue our lyues
make vs rather greater than we be in dede / 
and ſhewe the kyng that we be ſuche men able
to pay great raunſomes. ſyrs quod he ſo ſhall
I do / for I am boūde therto. than this knight
retourned to Lamorabaquy and to his counſayle / 
and ſyd howe thoſe knyghtes whiche
he hadde ſpoken with / were of the greateſt
men in all Fraunce / and were of the Kynges
lyngage / and ſaid they were able to pay great
raunſomes. Than Lamorabaquy ſayd howe
their lyues ſhulde be ſaued / and all other priſoners
to be ſlayne and hewen all to peces / in
example of all other. Than the kynge ſhewed
hym ſelfe before all the people that were there
aſſembled / to whome they all made lowe reuerence.
They made a lane for hym to paſſe thorough / 
euery man with his ſworde naked in
his hande / and ſo came thyder where the ſayd
lordes of Fraunce ſtode togyther. Than the
king wolde ſe the correction of the other / whiche
thynge the ſarazyns were deſyrous to do.
            THan they were all brought before Lamorabaquy
naked in their ſhyrtes / 
and he behelde them a lytell and than
tourned fro them warde / and made a ſygne
that they ſhuld be all ſlayne / and ſo they were
brought through the ſarazyns / that had redy
naked ſwordes in their handes / and ſo ſlayne
and hewen all to peces without mercy. This
cruell iuſtyce dyd Lamorabaquy that daye / 
by the whiche mo than thre hūdred gentlemen

of dyuers nacyons were tourmented & ſlayne
for the loue of god / on whoſe ſoules Ieſu haue
mercy. Amonge other was ſlayne ſyr Henry
Dantoigne of Heynalt / and ſo it was the lord
Boucyquante marſhall of Fraunce was one
of theym that was brought naked before the
kynge / and had ben ſlayne with other / and the
erle of Neuers had nat eſpyed hym. As ſone
as he ſawe hym he went ſtreyght to the kynge
and kneled downe / and deſyred hym effectuouſly
to reſpyte fro the dethe that knyght ſyr
Boucyquant / ſayenge howe he was a great
man in Fraūce / and able to pay a great raunſome.
Lamorabaquy condyſcended to the requeſt
of the erle of Neuers / and ſo ſyr Boucyquant
was ſette amonge them that ſhulde be
ſaued. Thus cruell iuſtyce was done that day
vpon the cryſten men / and bycauſe that Lamorabaquy
wolde that his vyctory ſhulde be
knowen in Fraunce / he apoynted out thre of
the frenche knyghtes to come before hym wher
of ſyr Iaques of Helley was one. Than the
kyng demaūded of the erle of Neuers whiche
of tho thre knyghtes he wolde choſe to ſende
in to Fraunce to the kynge and to the duke of
Burgoyne his father. Than the erle of Neuers
ſayd / ſyr and it pleaſe you I wolde that
this knyght ſyr Iaques of Helley ſhulde go
thyder fro you and fro vs. So ſyr Iaques taryed
with Lamorabaquy and the other two
knyghtes delyuered to dethe and ſo ſlayne / 
whiche was pytie. Than Lamorabaquy was
well apeaſed of his furoute / and vnderſtode
howe the kyng of Hungery was ſcaped away
a lyue. Than he determyned to retourne in to
Turkey to a cytie called Burſe / and ſo he dyd
and thyder all ye priſoners were brought / and
than his army departed / and ſpecyally ſuche
as were of farre coūtreys / as Tartary / Perce
Mede / Sury / Alerandre / and of Lecto. than
ſyr Iaques Helley was delyuered to retourne
in to Fraunce / and he was cōmaunded to retourne
throughe Lombardy / and to recommaunde
Lamorabaquy to the duke of Myllayne / 
and alſo he was ſtreyghtly cōmaunded
that in euery place as he paſſed / to manyfeſt
and publiſſhe the victory that Lamorabaquy
had vpon the cryſten men. The Erle of Neuers
wrote to the frenche kynge for hym ſelfe / 
and all his company / & to his father the duke
of Burgoyne / and to the ducheſſe his mother.
Whan this knyght had his charge as well by
writyng as by credence / he departed and toke
his way towardes Fraunce. Or he departed
he was ſworne and promyſed as ſoone as he
had done his meſſage in Fraūce / incontynent
to retourne agayne thyder / whiche othe and
promeſſe he acōplyſſhed lyke a trewe knight.
Nowe we wyll leaue ſpeakynge at this tyme
of Lamorabaquy and of the lordes of Fraūce
priſoners / and we wyll ſpeke of other maters
that fell the ſame ſeaſon.

the cryſten knightes of Fraunce and

               AFter this great dyſcō
               fyture
that the turkes had
vpon the criſten men / ſuche
Knyghtes as could ſaue
them ſelfe dyd. The ſame
mondaye there was a thre
hundred knyghtes & ſquyers
that were gone a foragynge / and were nat
at the batayle / for whan they knewe (by them
that fledde) that the batayle was doone / they
had no deſyre to retourne agayne to their lodginges / 
but fledde as well as they myght and
toke dyuers wayes to flye fro ye turkes. Ther
fled bothe frenchmen / engliſſhmen / almayns / 
ſcottes / Flemynges / and of other nacyons / 
and they came in to a countrey ioynynge to
Hungery called Blacquy / it was a countrey
replenyſſhed with dyuers people / they were
conquered vpon the turkes and tourned perforce
to the cryſten faythe. The kepers of the
portes / townes / and caſtels ſuffered theſe cryſten
men to entre and to lodge / but the nexte
mornynge at their departure they tooke fro
theſe knyghtes and ſquyers all that they had / 
and gaue them poore cotes / and a lytell ſlyuer
to paſſe therwith one dayes iourney. This
grace they ſhewed to the gentlemen. And as
for other yeomen & varlettes they were ſpoyled
all naked and ſore beaten and yuell entreated
without pytie. So they paſſed through
the coūtrey of Blacquy in great pouerte / and

through Hūgery / they coude ſcant get breed
for goddeſſake / nor lordgyng at nyght. they
endured this daunger in paſſynge tyll they
came to Vyen in Auſtrich. There they were
receyued more ſwetely / and refreſſhed and
newe cladde / and ſo throughe the realme of
Boeſme / For if they hadde founde the Almaygnes
ſo harde / they had neuer tourned
agayne / but rather dyed for colde and hunger.
Euery man that herde them tell of that
aduenture hadde pytie on them. So finally
they came in to Fraunce to Paris / and there
ſhewed their aduentures. At the begynnynge
they coude nat be beleued. Some in Parys
ſayde. It is pytie theſe vnthriftes be vnhanged
or drowned / for tellyng of ſuche lies
Howe be it theſe tidynges dayly multiplyed
wt reſortyng of newe men. Whan the frenche
kynge vnderſtode that theſe newes dayly renewed / 
they were nothyng pleaſaunt to hym
for it was a great dōmage of the loſſe of the
noble men of his blode / and of other good
knyghtes and ſquyers of the realme of Fraū
               ce.
Than he cōmaunded no man to be ſo hardye
to ſpeke any more of that mater / tyll he
were better enfourmed of the certentie / and
cōmaunded that all ſuche as were come oute
of Hungery / ſhulde be taken and put in priſone
tyll the trouth were knowen. So there
were many putte in to priſon. And the kyng
hadde ordayned / that if the newe were nat
trewe / that they ſhulde be all drowned and
putte to dethe.

batayle in Turkey was knowen

CC.xix.
            
               SO it was on Chriſtēmas
daye / ſir Iaques of Helley about
the houre of noone entred
in to Parys / and ſo toke his lodgynge / 
and demaunded where
the kyng was / and it was ſhewed hym that
he was at ſaynt Poules on ye ryuer of Seyn
Than he went thyder. There was with the
kyng the duke of Orlyaunce his brother / the
duke of Berrey / the duke of Burgoyne / the
duke of Burbone / and therle of ſaynt Poule
and dyuers other noble men of the realme of
Fraunce / as the vſage was for ſuche noble
men to be with the kynge at ſuche highe feeſtes.
So ſir Iaques of Helley entred in to
the court boted and ſpurred. As than he was
nat be knowen / for he had of long tyme haū
               ted
farre countreis. He dyd ſo moche that he
came to the kynges chambre / and ſayd / howe
he came fro Lamorabaquy oute of Turkey / 
and hadde ben at the batayle before Nicopolye / 
where the Chriſten men had loſt the iourney.
And ſayd he hadde letters fro the erle of
Neuers / and fro other lordes of Fraunce / ſuche
as were priſoners. than he was brought
to the kynge. He kneled downe / and wiſely
declared his meſſage / as well fro Lamorabaquy / 
as fro the erle of Neuers / and other
lordes of Fraunce priſoners in Turkey. the
kynge gaue hym audyence / and was ſwetely
examyned of all the hole mater / and to euery
thyng he anſwered ſo diſcretely / that ye kyng
was well content with hym / and was ryght
ſoroufull for the dōmage that ye kyng of Hugry
and they had ſuſteyned / Howe be it they
were gladde that the kyng of Hungery was
ſcaped / without dethe or priſonment / for they
ſayde he ſhulde recouer ryght well agayne
the loſſe and dōmage that he had receyued at
that tyme. Alſo they were ryght ioyfull that
the erle of Neuers and the other lordes were
eſcaped the dethe / and were but as priſoners
And they ſade there was no doute but they
ſhulde be raunſomed and delyuered. For ſir
Iaques of Helley ſayd / there was no doute
but that Lamorabaquy wolde within ye yere
put them to raūſome / for he loued golde and
richeſſe. And that ſir Iaques ſayd / he knewe
well / bicauſe he had long ben conuerſaunt in
Turkey / and ſerued Lamorabaquyes father
more than thre yere. Thus the kynge ryght
well receyued this knyght / and ſo dyde all other
lordes / ſuche as were there. And euery
man ſayd he was happy in this worlde to be
in ſuche a batayle / and to haue the acquayntaunce
of ſuche a hethan kynge / as Lamorabaquy
was / ſayenge it was an honoure for
him and for all his lynage. than the kyng cō
               maunded

all ſuche as were in priſon to be delyuered / 
wherof they were gladde.
            THus theſe newes that ſir Iaques of
Helley had brought / ſpredde anone a
brode in Fraunce and in other places. many
were right ſoroufull for the loſſe of their fathers
bretherne huſbandes / & chyldren / and
nat without good cauſe / and ſpecially ye gret
ladyes of Fraunce / as the ducheſſe of Burgoyne
for her ſonne the erle of Neuers / and
her doughter Margarete of Heynault was
ſoroufull for the erle her huſbande. In lykewyſe
was dolorous Mary of Berrey counteſſe
of Ewe for her huſbande the lorde Philyppe
of Arthoiſe conſtable of Fraunce. And
in lykewiſe ſo was the counteſſe of Marche / 
the lady of Coucy / and her dought of Bare / 
the lady of Sully / and many other ladyes / 
as well of Fraunce as of other places. And
whan they had wepte ynoughe / than they reconforted
them ſelfe / in that they were natte
ſlayne / but priſouers. But ſuche as knewe
their huſbādes / fathers / bretherne / chyldren / 
and frēdes deed / their lamētacions endured
long in Fraūce. The duke of Burgon made
moche of this knyght ſir Iaques of Helley / 
who had brought hym worde that his ſonne
was a lyue / and gaue hym many ryche gyftes / 
and reteyned hym as one of his knyghtes
with two hundred pounde of reuenewes
yerely duryng his lyfe. The Frenche kyng &
all other lordes gaue largely to this knight.
Thā he ſhewed howe he muſt nedes returne
agayne to Lamorabaquy / for that was his
promyſe at his departynge / for he ſtoode but
as priſoner: and ſayd / howe he hadde nat retourned / 
but to do this meſſage fro Lamorabaquy.
The kynge and other thought it but
reſonable / that he ſhulde kepe his promyſe.
Than the kynge and other wrote to theſe priſoners.
And it was concluded by counſayle / 
that the Frenche kyng ſhulde ſende a knight
of honour to Lamorabaquy / to thentent that
he myght retourne agayne to bring newe tydynges / 
in what caſe the priſoners were in.
There was apoynted to go in this voyage
ſir Iohn̄ of Caſtell morant / who was a wyſe
knyght and well languaged. Than it was
demaunded of ſir Iaques what iowelles or
preſentes the kynge myght beſt ſende to Lamorabaquy / 
and that ſhulde beſt pleaſe him / 
to the entent that the priſoners ſhulde be the
better entreated. The knight anſwered / that
Lamorabaquy toke gret pleaſure in clothes
of arras / made of olde auncyent hyſtories.
And alſo he ſayd / he had great delyte in theſe
whyte Faucons / called Gerfaucons. Alſo he
ſayd / that fyne lynnen clothes and fyne ſcarlettes
were moche made of there / for of clothe
of golde and ſylke they hadde plentie. This
pleaſed well the Frenche kyng and the duke
of Burgonoe / whoſe myndes were ſette to
pleaſe Lamorabaquy. Thus a .xii. dayes ſir
Iaques of Helley taryed at Parys / and euery
man was gladde to here hym reporte of ye
aduentures of Turkey / and of the maner of
Lamorabaquy.
            WHan he deꝑted to retourne / the kynge
ſayd to hym. Sir Iaques / take
your way and make but ſmall iourneys
at your eaſe. I thynke ye wyll returne
by Lombardy & ſpeke with the duke of Myllayne / 
for there is great amyte bytwene hym
and Lamorabaquy. But whiche waye ſo euer
ye go / we wyll that ſir Iohan of Caſtell
Morant abyde in Hungry tyll ye haue gote
hym a ſaueconducte to go to Lamorabaquy / 
with ſuche preſentes as we ſhall ſende hym / 
to the entent that he ſhulde be the more fauorable
to the priſoners. Sir quod he / all this
ſhalbe done. So he departed and tooke the
ſame waye he came. Anone after his departure / 
the kynge and the duke of Burgoyne
dyde prepare for theſe preſentes / and ſir Iohan
of Caſtell Morant diſpatched and had
his charge. He had with hym ſixe ſōmers laden
with preſētes / two of them with clothes
of arras / of the goodlyeſt that coude be gote
wrought with the ſtorie of Alexandre of his
lyfe and conqueſtes / ryght pleaſaunt to beholde.
other two ſōmers were charged with
fyne ſcarlettes whyte & reed. And alſo with
moche payne / the kynge gate of theſe whyte
gerfaucons. Thus ſir Iohan of Caſtell morant
departed fro Parys with his preſentes
and charge / a fyftene dayes after that ſir Iaques
of Helley was departed. In this mean
ſeaſon the kynge of Hungry retourned in to
his coūtre / wherof all his people were right
ioyfull for they loued hym / and ſo came & conforted
hym / and ſayde. Sir / though ye haue
hadde dōmage at this tyme / another tyme ye
ſhall right well recouer it. Thus the kynge

bare his dōmage as well as he myght. On ye
other parte / Lamorabaquy retourned in to
his countre / & came to a towne called Burſe
and thyder were all the priſoners brought / &
there ſette vnder ſure kepynge. They were
nothyng there at their eaſe. The heate of the
countrey and dyette ſore chaunged them / for
they hadde ben vſed before to ſwete and delycate
metes and drinkes / and had their owne
cookes and offycers that dyde prepare their
meates accordynge to their dyettes: & there
in Turkey they were ſarued all contrarye / 
with groſe meates / fleſſhe yuell ſodden and
dreſſed. They had ſpyces ynough / & bredde
made of mylke / clene fro the nature of Fraū
               ce.
They had wyne and that was with great
daunger. Thoughe they were all great lordes / 
they were but ſmally regarded there.
The turkes had as lyue they had been ſicke
as hole / and deed as a lyue. they wolde they
had ben all putte to execuſyon. So theſe priſoners
conforted eche other within themſelfe
for they ſawe none other remedy. ſo ſome of
thē their nature chaunged and fell in to ſickeneſſe.
He that made the beſt chere and countynaunce
was the Erle of Neuers / and that
he dyde to conforte his companyons. alſo ſir
Bouciquant and the erle of Marche and ſir
Henry of Bare were of good conforte / and
tooke euery thynge paciently / Sayeng that
the honours in armes nor the glorie or this
worlde / coude nat be hadde without payne / 
and ſomtyme with metyng of harde aduentures.
For they ſaid that there was neuer ſo
valyaunt and happy / that had alwayes euery
thyng as they wyſſhed. They ſayde they
were bounde to thanke god that he hadde ſaued
their lyues / conſydringe the diſpleaſure
that Lamorabaquy and his counſayle were
in / for the loſſe of their men / for it was ones
determyned that we ſhulde all generally haue
been putte to dethe. Than Bouciquaunt
ſayd / I ought aboue all other to thanke god
of my lyfe / for I was at the poynt to haue bē
hewen all to peces / as other of my company
were / but at the requeſt of my lorde here / the
erle of Neuers I was ſaued. This aduenture
call I good / and ſithe god hath delyuered
vs fro this paryll / he wyll and it pleaſe
hym delyuer vs fro a greatter / for we be his
ſoudyers / & for his ſake we haue this payne / 
For by reaſon that ſir Iaques of Helley is
gone in to Fraunce / I truſt within a yere we
ſhall haue good comforte / and be delyuered.
The matter can not abyde thus. The Frenche
kyng and the duke of Burgoyn wyll nat
forgette vs / but by ſome meanes / raunſomed
and delyuered.
            THus ſir Boucyquaunt reconforted
hym ſelfe / and tooke euery thyng in
good pacyence / but the lorde Coucy
coude take no cōforte / whiche was marueyle
for before that tyme he was a lorde of great
wyſdome and of great coniorte / & neuer was
abaſſhed. but beyng thus in priſon in Burſe
in Turkey / he was more diſconforted than
any other / and in more malencoly / And ſayd
he was ſure he ſhulde neuer retourne in to
Fraūce. Sir Henry of Bare conforted hym
as moche as he myght / and blamed hym of
his diſconforte / ſayeng howe he ought to gyue
conforte to all other. Howe be it the ſame
ſir Henry was ſore abaſſhed in hym ſelfe / &
oftentymes remembred his wyfe and wolde
wepe pituouſly. And in lykewiſe ſo dyd ſir
Philyppe of Arthoiſe erle of Ewe and conſtable
of Fraunce. Sir Guye of Tremoyle
was of good conforte / and ſo was the erle of
Marche. Lamorabaquy was content / ſomtyme
that they ſhulde haue ſome paſtyme / &
ſomtyme he wolde go hym ſelfe and ſe them / 
and iangle and bourde with them right graciouſly / 
and wolde that they ſhulde ſe parte
of his eſtate & puyſſaunce. ¶Nowe lette vs
leaue ſomwhat to ſpeke of them and ſpeke of
ſir Iaques of Helley and ſir Iohn̄ of Caſtell
Morant / who were bothe ryding towardes
Hungry.
            
               SIr Iaques of Helley taryed in
the cytie of Bode in Hungry about
a ten or .xii. dayes / abydinge
for ſir Iohan of Caſtell morant / 
And whan he was cōe ſir
Iaques was ioyfull / for he was deſyrous to
paſſe forthe in to Turkey / to acquyte hym of
his faythe and promyſe / and to ſe the erle of
Neuers and the lordes of Fraunce / and to
comforte them. Whan the kynge of Hungry
ſawe ſir Iohn̄ of Caſtelmorant he made him
good chere for the loue of ye frenche kynge / &
he vnderſtode that the frenche kyng had ſent
by hym gret preſētes & iowels to lamoraba
                  •
               
               
wherwith he was ſore diſpleaſed in his mynde / 
but he diſſymuled the mater / and kepte it
couert tyll ſir Iohan Heley was departed in
to Turkey warde / but he ſaid to ſuche of his
priuye counſayle as he diſcouered the mater
vnto / Howe that the miſcreant dogge his aduerſary
Lamorabaquy ſhulde haue no preſē
               tes
out of Fraunce / nor fro no place els / if it
laye in his power to lette it. Sir Iohn̄ Helley
was departed / and promyſed to gette of
Lamorabaquy a ſaueconducte for ſir Iohan
Morant / to paſſe in to Turkey and repaſſe.
So long he trau
                  •
               yled with guydes / that he
came in to Turkey to the cytie of Burſe / but
as than Lamorabaquy was in another cytie
called Poly. And where ſo euer he went the
priſoners were caryed with hym / excepte the
lorde Coucy who taryed ſtyll at Burſe / for
he coude nat endure to ryde / he was ſo ſicke / 
and with hym taryed a coſyn of his of Grece
a right valyant barone / diſcended of the lynage
of the dukes of Auſtriche / who was called
Mathelyn. Whan ſir Iaques was come
to Poley Lamorabaquy was gladde to ſe
hym / bycauſe he was come out of Fraunce.
Than ſir Iaques right humbly ſaid to him.
Right dere & redouted ſir / beholde here your
priſoner to the beſt of my power / I haue don
your meſſage ye ye gaue me in charge to do.
Than Lamorabaquy ſayd / thou arte welcōe
Thou haſt trewly acquyted thy ſel
                  •
               e / & therfore
I acquyte the of thy raunſome & priſon / 
ſo that thou mayſt go / retourne / & tary at thy
pleaſure: wherof ſir Iaques right hūbly thā
               ked
hym. Than he ſhewed howe the frenche
kyng and the duke of Burgoyne had ſente a
knyght of honoure embaſſade to hym with
credēce / and had brought with hym certayne
preſentes of pleaſure fro the Frenche kyng.
Lamorabaquy demaunded what they were / 
and if he had ſene them or nat. The knyght
aunſwered ſir / I haue nat ſene them / but the
knyght that hath ye charge to do the meſſage
is at Bode in Hungry. And ſir / I am come
before to ſhewe you therof / & to haue a ſaueconducte
for the ſayd knyght to come and to
retourne ſafely. Than Lamorabaquy ſayd.
We wyll that he haue one / as thou wylte deuyſe / 
wherof the knyght thanked hym. So
they departed as at that tyme. Another tyme
ſir Iaques ſpake with Lamorabaquy & kneled
downe before hym and humbly requyred

ſtudyed a lytell or he aunſwered / and at laſte
ſayd. Thou ſhalte ſpeke with one of them / 
but with no mo / and ſo ſent for the erle of Neuers
alone / and whan he was come ſir Helley
kneled downe to hym. Therle was glad
to ſe hym / and demaunded howe the frenche
kynge and the duke his father / & the duches
his mother dyde. The knyght ſhewed hym
all that he knewe / and all that he was charged
to ſaye to hym / howe be it they had nat
ſo good leyſar to talke togyder / as they wolde
haue had / for Lamorabaquyes men that
were there preſent badde them haue done / for
they ſayd they had other thynges to do / than
to ſtande there and wayte vpon them. Than
ſir Iaques demaunded of the Erle howe all
the other lordes of Fraunce dyde. The Erle
ſaid they were all in good caſe / except ye lorde
of Coucy / who was ſomwhat diſeaſed / and
was at the cytie of Burſe. Than ſir Iaques
ſhewed hym howe ſir Iohan of Caſtell morant
was come out of Fraunce / fro the kyng
and fro the duke of Burgoyne in ambaſſade
to Lamorabaquy / and to aſſwage his yre / he
hath ſent hym ryche iewelles and preſentes / 
but he is at Bode in Hungry with the kyng
there / and I am come before for a ſauecōduct
for hym to come and go / the whiche Lamorabaquy
hath graunted. And I thynke I ſhall
retourne to hym ſhortely. Herof therle was
right ioyous / but he durſt make no ſemblant
for feare of the Turkes but ſaid. ſir Iaques
I vnderſtande by you / that ye are quyte of
your raunſome and priſon / and that ye maye
retourne whan it pleaſeth you in to Fraūce / 
whan ye come there / I praye you ſhewe the
kyng and my father that we all deſyre them / 
to treate as ſhortely as maye be for our delyueraunce / 
by ſome marchauntes genowayes
or veniſyons / and agree at the fyrſt worde to
that Lomorabaquy ſhall deſyre for our raū
               ſome / 
for if they ſhulde make long treatie wt
hym / we ſhalbe loſt for euer. for I vnderſtā
               de
Lamorabaquy is trewe of his worde / curteſſe
and ſhorte in all his maters / ſo he be taken
at the poynt.
            Thus the erle of Neuers and ſir Iaques
departed. Whan the ſaueconducte was redy

it was delyuered to ſir Iaques. Than he toke
his leaue of Lamorabaquy / and of other
of his courte of his aquayntaunce / and rode
ſo longe by his iourneys / that he arryued at
Bode in Hungry. Than he drewe to ſir Iohan
Moraunt / who thought longe for hym.
Than ſir Iaques ſayd. ſir / I haue brought
you a ſaueconducte to go in to Turkey / and
all youre company / and to retourne agayne
at your pleaſure. I am gladde therof ꝙ the
knyght. Lette vs go to the kyng of Hungry
and ſhewe hym therof / and than to morowe
betymes lette vs departe / for I haue taryed
here longe ynoughe. Than they bothe togyder
wente to the kyng in to his chambre / and
ſhewed hym all the mater. The kynge than
anſwered and ſayde. Sir Iohan Moraunt
and ye Helly / ye be welcome / ye ſhall go at
youre pleaſure / for the loue of my coſyns of
Fraunce / to whom I wolde be gladde to do
pleaſure / and to you alſo. ye maye go & come
throughe my realme at your pleaſure / and alſo
in to Turkey if ye pleaſe: But as for your
preſentes that you ſir Iohan haue brought
out of Fraūce / I wyll nat agree that ye ſhall
conuey them to that hell hounde Lamorabaquye / 
He ſhall neuer be enryched therwith.
It ſhulde tourne to our great ſhame and rebuke / 
if he ſhulde make his auauut / that bycauſe
he hath had victorie on vs / and hath in
daunger and priſon certayne lordes of Frā
               ce / 
that for feare therof / there ſhulde be ſente
to hym riche preſentes: as for the Gerfaucōs
I care nat for / for foules flye lightly oute of
one countre in to another / they are ſoone gyuen
and ſoone loſt / But as for riche hangynges
of arras are thynges to be ſene and to endure

if ye wyll paſſe in to Turkey with your ger
faucōs go whan it pleaſe you / but as for any
other thyng ye ſhall haue non with you: thā
the knyght aunſwered and ſayd. Certaynly
ſir it ſhulde nat be myne honour / nor pleaſāt
to the Frenche kynge / nor to the lordes that
haue ſente me hyder / without I myght accōplyſſhe
my voyage / as I haue in charge.
well quod the kynge / ye ſhall haue none other
waye of me at this tyme. So the kynge
went fro them and lefte the two knightꝭ ſpekynge
toguyder. They were ſore troubled
with the abuſyon on the kynge of Hungery.
Than they counſayled toguyder / what was
beſt for them to do. Than they determyned
to ſende haſtye meſſangers to the frēche kynge
and to the duke of Burgoyne / ſithe they
ſawe they coulde haue none other remedy / 
they wrote letters to the kyng and to the duke
of Burgoyne / that they ſhulde ꝓuyde for
the mater. They ſente their letters by poſte / 
to make the more haſt / and taryed ſtyll them
ſelfes at Bode with the kyng of Hungry / abyding
the retourne of their meſſanger.
            THis meſſanger ſpedde ſo well / and
made ſuche dilygence / that he came
to Parys / and there founde ye kyng

               s and they were reed at length / with
the whiche they were nothynge pleaſed / and
had marueyle that the kyng of Hungry wolde
nat ſuffre his preſentes to paſſe throughe
his countre in to Turkey. The duke of Berrey
excuſed the kynge of Hungry and ſayde / 
howe he had good cauſe to do as he dyde / for
it is a thyng to humbly done for the kynge to
ſende ſuche preſentes to an hethan thyng. the
duke of Burgoyne / bycauſe the mater touched
hym / he was of the contrary opinyon / 
and ſaid it was a thyng reaſonable ſo to do / 
ſith that fortune hath ben ſo fauorable to him
to haue the vyctorie in ſuche a batayle / and
hath hadde the kyng of Hungry in chaſe and
hath taken priſoners / all ſuche noble men as
were agaynſt hym in that iourney / wherfore
the frēdes of thoſe priſoners may well fynde
the meanes howe to comforte them for their
delyueraunce. This dukes wordes were vp
holden with the kynge and with dyuers of
his counſayle. Than the kynge demaunded
of his vncle of Berrey? Sayeng / fayre vncle / 
if Lamorabaquy the ſoudan or any other
hethan kynge ſende you a ruby or a ryche iewell / 
wheder wyll ye receyne it or nat. Sir
quod he I wolde take aduyſe. Than yt kyng
ſayd / It paſſeth nat yet tenne yere / ſythe the
ſoudan ſente you a ruby whiche coſt twentie
thouſande frankes. So the kynge of Hungries
dede was nat ſuſteygned / but it was
ſayd that he had yuell done to ſtoppe the goyng
of theſe preſentes / and that it ſhulde rather
hynder the priſoners than auaunce thē.
Than the kyng was coūſayled to write to ye
kyng of Hungry amyable letters / deſyringe
hym nat to ſtoppe his knyght / but ſuffre him

to paſſe in to Turkey with his preſētes and
meſſage. Than letters were written / ſealed / 
and delyuered agayne to the ſame meſſāger / 
and ſo he departed to retourne in to Hūgry.

            ¶Howe the ducheſſe of Orlyaunce
doughter to the duke of Myllayne
was had in ſuſpecte of the Frenche
kynges ſyckeneſſe. Cap. CC.xx.
            YE haue harde here before / howe
the Frēche kyng lightly euery yere
was ſore enclyned to fall in to a frā
               ſey / 
ſo that there was nother Phiſycion nor
ſurgion that coude remedy hym. Many ſaid
they wolde helpe hym / but whan̄e it came to
the poynt all their labour was in vayne / for
the kynges ſickeneſſe wolde nat ceaſe nother
for prayers nor for medycins / tyll it had ron
his full courſe. Some of his phiſycions and
arioles and charmers / whan they ſawe no remedy / 
than they ſaid ſurely / howe the kynge
was poyſoned or be wytched / by crafte of ſorcerye / 
whiche noyſe made the lordes & other / 
to haue many in ſuſpecte. And ſome of theſe
nigromancers affyrmed that the kynges ſickeneſſe
came by reaſon of ſorcery and charmes.
And to make thē beleue it was ſo / they
ſayd they knewe it by the ſpyrites / who had
ſhewed it to them. Of theſe deuins / arioles
and charmers / there were certayne brente at
Parys and at Auignon. They ſpake ſo moche
and ſayd / that the ducheſſe Valentyne of
Orlyaūce / doughter to the duke of Myllayn
hadde witched the kynge / to the entent to attayne
to the crowne of Fraunce. They had
ſo ſclaundred this lady / ye brute ran through
the realme / that ſhe vſed ſuche craftes of ſorcery / 
ſayeng: that as long as ſhe was about
the kyng / and that he myght ſe her / the kyng
ſhulde nat amēde. So it behoued this lady
to auoyde this ſclaunder / and to flye fro the
paryll therof / to departe fro Parys / and ſo
ſhe wente to Aſyners a fayre Caſtell nere to
Pontoyſe / ꝑteyning to her huſbande the duke
of Orlyaūce. And afterwarde ſhe went &
dwelt at Newcaſtell on the ryuer of Loyre / 
parteynynge to her huſbande / who was ſore
diſpleaſed in his hert / that ſuche a brute ran
vpon his wyfe / howe be it he diſſymuled the
mater as well as he myght. Nor dyd nat abſent
hym ſelfe fro the court / for he had moche
buſyneſſe for the maters of the realme. The
duke of Myllayne called Galeas / was well
enformed howe his doughter the ducheſſe of
Orlyaunce was accuſed / wherof he was ſore
diſpleaſed. And he ſente twyſe or thriſe ambaſſadours
to the Frenche kyng and his coū
               ſayle / 
and offred to fynde a knyght to fyght
at vttraūce / with any man that wolde accuſe
his doughter of any trayſon. And the meſſā
               gers
in a maner thretned that ye duke wolde
make warre in to Fraunce / bycauſe the frenche
kyng beyng in good helthe (at Balyngham / 
bitwene ſaynt Omers and Calis) ſaid
that aſſone as he were retourned in to Fraū
               ce / 
he wolde entende to nothyng / but to make
warre vpon the duke of Myllayne. And
alſo the kyng of Englande / who as than called
hym ſelfe his ſonne / bycauſe he had maryed
his doughter / promyſed to ſende hym a
thouſande ſperes and ſixe thouſāde archers / 
wherof the frenche kyng was right ioyfull.
Prouiſyon was made for the Frenche kyng
in the countie of Sauoy & in ye Dolphenry.
The kynges mynde was to entre that waye
in to Lombardy / to make warre on the duke
of Myllaygne. But that iourney toke none
effecte. For whan tidynges was brought in
to Fraunce of the diſconfyture of the batayle
before Nicopoly in Turkey / and of ye dethe
and takynge of the lordes of Fraunce / The
kynge & the duke of Burgoyne were ſo charged
and buſyed in that behalfe / that the iourney
in to Lombardy was defected. And alſo
they ſawe well yt the duke of Myllayne was

at Paris with the kynge his nephue / and had
the chiefe gouernaunce of the realme / wherby
his buſyneſſe had the better effecte. The ſame
ſeaſone there was at Parys a marchaunt of
Turkey / who had all the doynge for all other
Lombardes / he was knowen and ſpoken of
through out all the worlde / his name was called
Dyne of Reſponde / & by hym all exchaunges
were made. He was in good fauour with
the kyng and other lordes before this iourney
in Turkey / but than after the batayle he was
moche more made of. Often tymes the duke
of Burgoyne demaunded of hym counſayle
howe he myght entre in to treatie with Lamorabaquy / 
for the redempcion of his ſonne and
of the other priſoners in Turkey. Sir ꝙ this
marchaūt / lytell and lytell ſome meanes wyll

and of other iſles are knowen ouer all / and occupyeth
the trade of marchaūdyſe in Quayre
in Alexandre / in Dāmas / in Danuet / in Turkey / 
and out in farre countreys hethan / for as
ye knowe well marchaundyſe flyeth ouer all

amyably to theym / and promeſſe them great
benefytes and profytes / if they wolde do for
you. There is nothynge but it is ouercome
with golde and ſyluer. And alſo ſyr the kynge
of Cyper / who hath hadde no warre with the
kyng Lamorabaquy / he may ryght well ayde
you. Syr / as for me ye may be ſure I wyll do
what I canne / for I am bounde therto. It is
nat to be marueyled though the duke of Burgoyne
and the duches ſought out wayes howe
they might recouer agayne their ſonne / for he
was their heyre / therfore it touched thē ryght
nere. The ladyes of Fraunce tooke great ſorowe
for their huſbandes and louers / ſpecyally
the lady of Coucy coude nat forget her huſbande / 
ſhe wepte pytuouſly nyght and daye
and coulde take no comforte. The duke of Lorayne
and ſyr Henry her two bretherne came
to ſaint Gobyn to ſe and to recomforte her / as
moche as they myght / & they ſayd they wolde
ſende in to Turkey to knowe howe he dyd / for
they ſaid they vnderſtode howe he had a more
gentyll priſone than any of his felowes had.
The lady Coucy thanked greatly her two bretherne
for their counſayle and great comforte.
Than ſhe deſyred ſir Robert Den a valyaunt
knyght of Cambreſys / to take the payne to go
in to Hungery and in to Turkey / to ſe what
condycyon her huſbande the lorde of Coucy
was in. The knyght ſayd for her ſake he was
content to go thyder / & to bringe the certaynte

perſones with him. Other ladyes in Fraunce
ſent in lyke wyſe to knowe what caſe their huſbandes

            YE haue herde here before / howe the

and in this opynion the kynge longe contynued / 
whiche was right dyſpleaſaunt to ſir
Morant and to ſyr Helley / but they coude nat
amende it. And ſo it happed yt the great mayſter
of the Rodes came in to Hungery to the
cytie of Bode / to whome the kyng made good
chere / wherto he was bounde / for the daye of

Morant and ſyr Helley aunſwered and ſayd / 
howe his cōmaundement ſhulde be doone / to

and retourned in to Hungery / and by the
way they encountred the meſſanger that was
ſent in to Fraunce to the kynge / bringynge a
gayne letters fro the frenche kynge to the kyng
of Hungery. Than this meſſanger retourned

               IT is long ſyth I ſpake
of the duke of Glouceſtre / 
yongeſt ſonne to the kynge
of England Edwarde the
thyrde / I had no tyme to
ſpeke of him tyll nowe / and
bycauſe his herte coude neuer
loue the frenche men / therfore of the loſſe
that the frenche men had in Turkey / he was
rather gladde than ſory. The ſame ſeaſone he
had a knyght with hym called ſyr Iohan Laquyquay / 
chiefe of his counſayle (as it was
knowen after) he ſayde to his lorde. Syr the
fumes and pride of the frenche men are well a
bated / by reaſone of their iourney in to Hungery
and Turkey. they be ſo full of pride and
brages that they canne come to no good concluſion
of any enterpriſe yt they take in hande.
That is trewe quod the duke / and that apered
right well / duryng the warre in the dayes
of the kynge my father / and of my brother the
prince of Wales / for as than they coulde neuer
atayne to any iourney agaynſt the Englyſſhe

haue trewce with them / for if the warre were
open / and by reaſon of our good tytell togyther / 
we ſhulde nowe make them better warre
than euer was made before. for as nowe all
the floure of chyualry of Fraunce is outher
taken or ſlayne / and the men of Englande deſyre
to haue warre rather than peace / for they
canne better lyue in warre than peace / for in
lyenge ſtyll is none aduauntage. and I ſwere

paſte the Frenche men haue kept no promeſſe
with vs / but haue falſely and craftely taken away
the herytage of the duchy of Acquytayn / 
whiche was gyuen and delyuered by agrement
of good treatie of peace to the kynge my
father / whiche often tymes I haue ſhewed to
the counſayle of Fraunce / whan we met and
comuned togyther in the fronter of the marcheſſe
of Calays / but alwayes they floryſſhed
their entētes with ſo ſwete wordes / that myne
opynion was nat regarded nor belyued / nouther

but if there were a good heed kynge of
Englande / that deſyred the warre as well as
I do / and wolde put to his payne to recouer
his herytage / whiche craftely and falſely hath
been taken fro hym without any good tytle of

thouſande archers / and ſyxe thouſande
men of armes redy aparelled to ſerue him and

in aduenture in his ſeruyce. But it is nat
ſo / there is no ſuche Kynge in Englande as
nowe that loueth any dedes of armes / if there

there was neuer ſo good tyme to make warre
in Fraūce as now / for who ſoeuer goeth nowe
ſhalbe fought withall / whiche is all the deſyre

that englyſſhmen haue in truſt of wynnyng / 
as they had in tyme paſte in the dayes of good

and drinke / and reſte / and dalyenge with ladyes
and damoſelles. This is no lyfe for men
of warre that wyll deſerue to haue honour by
prowes of dedes of armes. yet I remembre
me of the laſt iourney yt I made into Fraunce.
I thynke I had in my company but two thou
ſande ſpeares and eyght thouſande archers / 
and ſo paſſed the ſee / and entred in to the realme
of Fraunce fro Calayesꝭ and ſo wente a
longe in to the realme / and foūde none to with
ſtande me / nor none that durſt fyght with me / 
in lyke wyſe ſo dyd ſyr Robert Canoll and ſir
Hugh Caurell / and Thomas of Graūtſome / 
and ſyr Phylyppe Gyſſarde / and yet they had
nat the nombre that I had with me / and yet
they were before Parys and demaunded batayle
of the frenche kynge / but they coulde neuer
be aunſwered / nor founde any perſon that
ſayd any thyng to them / and ſo they rode into
Bretayne / and ſo a longe through the realme
of Fraunce / fro Calais to Burdeaux / without
hauynge of any batayle or rencountre. but I
thynke ſurely / who ſo wolde nowe make any
ſuche iourney they ſhulde be fought with all / 
for he that calleth hym ſelfe kynge in Fraunce
is yonge / hote / and of great corage and enterpriſe / 
he wolde ſurely fight / what ende ſo euer

for we loue nothynge ſo well as to haue batayle / 
for without it be by batayle and victory
vpon the frenche men (who be ryche) els we

it / for the kyng taketh and ſhall take and reyſe
great tayles of ye marchauntes / wherwith they
be nat content / and yet they can nat tell where
the good becometh. Thus the kynge enpouereth
the realme of Englande / and gyueth to
one and other largely / and there as it is but yuell
beſtowed / and his people vyeth the bargayne / 
whiche ſhortely wyll growe to a rebellyon
within the realme / for the people begyn
to clater and to murmure therat / ſayeng howe
they wyll no lēger ſuffre nor beare it / he ſayeth

ones concluded bytwene him & Fraunce / that
than he wyll make a voyage in to Irelande / 
and enploye there his men of armes and archers / 
and there he hath ben but with a ſmall

good worde of him / and though he were with
his brother the duke of Lācaſtre / as one of the
greateſt rulers of the Realme / he toke no care
therof. And whan the kyng dyd ſende for him
he wolde come at his pleaſure / and ſometyme
nat a whyt. And whan he came to the kynge / 
he wolde be the laſte ſhulde come / and the firſt
that wolde departe / and in counſayle what he
had ones ſayd of his opynion / he wolde haue
it taken and accepted / els he wolde be diſpleaſed / 
and ſomtyme take his leaue and departe
to his maner in Eſſex called Plaſſhey / there
was his chiefe abydynge. This duke was a
great prince / and might well ſpende by yere a
threſcore thouſande ducates / he was duke of
Glouceſtre / erle of Eſſex and of Buckingham
and conſtable of Englande. He was of ſo marueylous
condycyons / that the kynge douted
hym more than any other of his vncles / for in
his wordes he wolde nat ſpare nor forbeare
the kynge. The kynge alwayes was humble
and meke to hym / and whatſoeuer he wolde
demaunde the kynge wolde graunte it hym.
This duke had cauſed in Englāde to be done
many cruell and haſty iugementes / for he had
cauſed to be beheeded withoute tytell of any

good reaſone that noble knyght ſyr Symon
Burle / and dyuers other of the kynges counſayle.
and chaſed out of Englande the archebyſſhop
of yorke and the duke of Irelande / 
bycauſe they were ſo nygh of the kinges counſayle / 
and layde to their charge that they had
counſayled the kynge wronge / and ledde hym
as they lyſt / and had ſpente the reuenewes of
Englande at their pleaſures. This duke had
two bretherne / the duke of Lancaſtre and the
duke of yorke. Theſe two were euer about the
kynge / wherat this duke of Glouceſtre hadde
great enuy / & wolde ſay to dyuers / as to ſuche
as he truſted (as Robert byſſhop of London
and to other / whan they came to him to Plaſſhey)
Frendes / my two bretherne ouerchargeth
greatly the kynges houſe / it were better
they were at home at their owne houſes. this
duke by ſubtyle couerte wayes / drewe to his
acorde ye londoners / for he thought if he might
be ſure of them / he ſhulde ſone haue all the reſt
of the realme to his acorde. This duke had a
nephue / ſonne to the doughter of his elder brother / 
called Lyonell duke of Clarence / whiche
doughter was maryed into Lombardy to the
ſonne of ſyr Galeas duke of Myllayne. This
duke Lyonell dyed in the cytie of Aſte in Piemounte.
So this duke of Glouceſtre wolde
gladly haue ſene his nephue ſonne to ye doughter
of the duke of Clarence / called Iohan erle
of Marche / to haue ben kynge of Englande / 
and to haue had his nephue kynge Rycharde
depoſed / for he ſayd howe the kynge was nat
worthy to holde nor to gouerne the realme of
Englande. This he wolde ſay to them that he
truſted / and he dyd ſo moch that he cauſed the
erle of Marche to come to his houſe / and than
and there he dyſcouered to hym all his entent
and ſecretneſſe and ſayde / howe he had determyned
to make hym kynge of Englande / and
kyng Richarde to be put downe and his wyfe
alſo / and to be kept in priſon dutynge their lyues / 
and ſo he deſyred effectuouſly the erle to
accept his offre and good wyll / ſayenge howe
he wolde do the beſte he coulde to bringe it aboute / 
and that he had of his acorde and alyaunce
the erle of Arundell and therle of Warwyke / 
and dyuers other prelates and lordes
of Englande. The erle of Marche was ſore
abaſſhed / whan he herde the duke his vncle
ſpeke ſuche wordes / howe be it lyke a yonge
man he diſſymuled the mater / and aunſwered
wyſely / to thentent to pleaſe the duke / and ſaid
howe he wold be glad to be ruled as he wolde
haue hym / but he ſayd he wolde be well aduyſed
or he accepted ſuche promiſſe to ſone / and
wolde take therin aduyſe and delyberacyon.
And whan ye duke of Glouceſtre ſawe the maner
of the erle / than he deſyred him to kepe the
mater ſecrete. The erle anſwered ſo he wolde
do. Than therle departed as ſone as he coude
and ſo wente in to Irelande to his herytage / 
and after he wolde neuer entende to the dukes
treatie / but alwayes excuſed him ſelfe wyſely / 
yet euer he kept the mater ſecrete / for he ſawe
well the concluſyon ſhulde nat be good.
            IT was ſayd howe the duke of Glouceſtre
ſought all the wayes he coude
to ſet a trouble in Englande / and to
ſtyrre the londoners agaynſt the kynge. So
it was the ſame yere that the truce was made
bytwene Englande and Fraunce / to endure
for thyrty yere / and that the kynge was retourned
agayne in to Englande with his yonge
wyfe / than the duke of Glouceſtre enfourmed
the Londoners and ſayd. Syrs / make ye a requeſt
to the kynge and it ſhall be reaſonable / 
deſyre that ſeynge he hath peace with his enemyes / 
that ye may be franke and fre fro all ſubſydies
and aydes that hath ben graunted this
twenty yere paſt / affyrmyng howe they were
nat graunted but durynge the ſeaſone of the
warre / for ye ſyrs (quod the duke that be marchauntes
are yuell entreated and ſore oppreſſed / 
to pay of euery hundred florens .xiii. and
all theſe goodes are ſpent in ydleneſſe / in daū
               ſynge
and makynge of feaſtes / and eatynge
and drinkynge / and all ye pay for / wherby ye
be ſore traueyled. and ſhewe you to the kynge
howe ye wolde that the realme of Englande
ſhulde be gouerned acordinge to the auncyent
cuſtomes / and ye may ſay that whan the kyng
hath any nede or the realme / or for the honour
of the coūtrey / and for the defence therof / howe
that ye wyll be redy to ayde it / in ſuche wyſe
that the kynge and his counſayle ſhall holde
them content. Thus by the ſettynge on of the
duke of Glouceſtre / the Londoners and the
counſayles of dyuers other cyties and townes
of Englande / aſſembled theym togyther / 
and on a day came to Eltham a ſeuen myle fro
London / where the kyng was / and whan they
came before the Kynge they made a requeſt

of all theſe foreſayd thynges / and wolde that
it ſhulde haue ben acomplyſſhed incontynent.
And whan this requeſt was made there was
with the kynge no mo of his vncles but two / 
the dukes of Lancaſtre and of yorke. Than
the kynge charged the Duke of Lancaſtre to
make theym an aunſwere / and than the duke
ſayd to them. ſyrs / the kynges pleaſure is that
ye departe home euery man to his owne / and
within a moneth aſſemble agayne togyder at
London or at Weſtmynſter / & there the kynge
wyll be with his counſayle / and his nobles / 
prelates and other / and they they wyll be redy
to here your requeſtes / and loke what ſhall be
thought neceſſary by his counſayle / the kynge
wyll graunt it you / in ſuche wyſe that ye ſhall
all be well contente. This aunſwere pleaſed
many of them / but nat all / for there were ſome
that were of the opinyon of the duke of Glouceſtre / 
who wolde haue had a ſhorter anſwere / 
but the dukes of Lancaſtre and of yorke apeaſed
them with fayre ſwete wordes / and ſo they
departed for that tyme. But for all that they
left nat their purſute / ſo that the next moneth
after they aſſembled at Weſtmynſter / there be
ynge the kynge with his counſayle / and than
there was preſent the duke of Glouceſtre / who
greatly enclyned to their demaundes / but at
makinge of the aunſwere he ſpake nat all that
he thought in his hert / but diſſymuled the mater / 
to the entent that the kynge nor his bretherne
ſhulde nat perceyue his mynde. Than
the duke of Lancaſtre made the aunſwere to
the londoners for the kynge and ſayd. ye ſyrs
of London and other / the kynge hath cōmaunded
me to gyue you a determynable anſwere
to your requeſtes in his name and his counſayle / 
and by the conſent of other prelates and
noble men of his realme. Sirs ye knowe well
to the entent to eſchewe all parelles and daungers
that myght come to this Realme / there
was a generall graunt made by you and other
of the good cyties and townes of Englande / 
that there ſhulde be rayſed a tayle on the ſtate
of marchaundyſe / in maner and fourme as it
hath tynne nowe vpon a ſyxe yere / that was
to paye of euery hundred .xiii. and by reaſon
therof the kynge graunted and ſealed to you
certayne frauncheſſes / the whiche he is nat in
mynde to take fro you / but rather to encreaſe
it dayly acordyng to your deſertes. but where
as ye nowe wolde repell agayne that ye ones
wyllyngly agreed vnto and graunted / therfore
here openly he repelyth agayne all ſuche
graces and grauntes as he hath made to you
before this tyme. Beholde here all theſe noble
men and prelates haue ſworne and promeſſed
to the kynge to ayde and ſuſtayne all thynges
lawfully gyuen and graunted. therfore ſyrs
conſidre well that the ſtate of the king is great
and chargeable / and if it augment in one maner / 
it mynyſſheth in another / for the rentes
and reuene was turneth nat to the kynges profyte
as moche as it hath doone in tyme paſte / 
the kinge and his counſayle hath ben at great
coſte and charge / ſythe the warres renewed
bytwene Englande and Fraunce / and great
charge it hath been to the kynge for ſuche ambaſſadours
as haue treated bytwene the parties / 
as well here as beyonde the ſee / alſo the
purſuynge of the kynges maryage hath coſte
gret goodes. And though there be nowe peace
bytwene the realmes / yet the charge is great
of kepynge of the garyſons in townes and caſtelles / 
beynge vnder the kynges obeyſaunce
as well in Gaſcoyne / Burdeloys / Bayonois / 
Bygore / and the marches of Gyan and Calays / 
alſo in kepyng the ſee and the portes and
hauens of Englande. in lykewyſe it is chargeable
the kepyng of the fronters of Scotlande
whiche may nat be vnprouyded / and alſo the
marcheſſe of Irelande. All theſe thynges and
other conſernynge the kynges eſtate and honour
of the realme / draweth yerely great coſte
and charge / whiche is farre better knowen by
the noble men of ye realme / than by any of you
that medeleth but with your marchaundyſe.
Thanke god
                  •
               irs that ye be thus in peace / and
take hede that none paye without he be worthy
and occupye the feate of marchaundyſe / 
and as well payeth the ſtraungers / as ye do.
ye be at a freer marte than they of Fraunce or
Lombardy / or other Realmes / whyther as
youre marchaundyſe repayreth / for they be
tayled and retayled agayne two or thre tymes
in a yere / and ye paſſe by a reaſonable ordynaunce
ſette and aſſeſſed vpon your marchaundyſe.
            THeſe wordes or ſuche lyke ſpoken by
the duke of Lancaſtre apeaſed greatly
the people / who were ſette to do yuell / 
by the ſettynge on of other. Thus they
departed at yt tyme without any other thynge

doynge / and the moſte parte of theym were
well content / and ſuche as wolde the contrary
made no ſemblante therof at that tyme. The
duke of Glouceſtre retourned to his maner of
Plaſſhey / and he ſawe well as at that tyme he
coulde nat brynge his purpoſe to paſſe / but
ſtyll he ſtudyed howe to make trouble in Englande / 
and to fynde the wayes howe to renewe
the warre in Fraunce and he had of his
acorde his wyfes vncle the Erle of Arundell / 
who deſyred nothynge but warre / and they
had doone ſo moche that they had drawen to
their acorde the erle of Warwyke.
            TTHe kinge of Englande had two
bretherne by his mother / one called
Thomas Erle of Kente / and
the ſeconde ſir Iohan of Holande
a valyaunt knyght / who had to his wyfe the
doughter of the duke of Lācaſtre / he was erle
of Huntyngdon and chamberlayne with the
kynge / it was he that ſlewe the ſonne of Rycharde
erle of ſtafforde / as ye haue herde here
before in this hyſtorie. The ſayde Rycharde
erle of Stafforde had a ſquyer to his ſonne / 
who was with the duke of Glouceſtre. This
erle of Huntyngdon moſte cōmonly was euer
in the courte with the kynge his brother / and
he knewe more of the dealynge of the duke of
Glouceſtre than any other dyd / for couertely
and wyſely he made enquery / and alſo he douted
greatly the duke / for he knewe he was fell
and ſodayne / and hyghe mynded / and ſawe
howe he kept his enemye aboute hym / for the
dethe of the yonge Stafforde / and the peace
therof was neuer made / but the grudge therof
contynued ſtyll. The kynge loued well his
brother / and bare him againſt euery man. and
the kynge ſawe well howe his vncle the duke
of Glouceſtre was euer contrary to hym / and
was euer about to conſpyre agaynſt him / and
to ſtyrre the realme to rebellyon. ſo the kynge
and his brother of Holande wolde often tymes
comune togyther. The ſame ſeaſone the
frenche kyng had ſent the erle of ſaynt Powle
in to Englande to ſe the kyng and his doughter
the quene and to noriſſhe loue / for the truce
was made in ſuche maner and cōdycion / that
their ſubgiettes myght repayre eche to other
in dyſpyte of all their yuell wyllers. the kynge
and the erle of Huntyngdon made them good
chere / as well for the honoure of the Frenche
kynge / as for that he had wedded their ſuffer.
At that tyme the Dukes of Lancaſtre nor of
yorke were nat with the kynge / for they began
ſomwhat to diſſymule / for they ſawe well
that the people in Englande beganne to murmure
in dyuers places / on the ſtate and rewle
that the kynge kept / and that the maters were
lykely to go yuell. They thought they wolde
nat be at the kinges cōmaundement nor at the
peoples. And all this came by reaſone of the
duke of Glouceſtre and his company. The
kynge of Englande ſpared nat to ſhewe therle
of ſaint Powle the ſtate that Englande ſtode
in / and howe he founde alwayes his vncle the
duke of Glouceſtre harde and rebell agaynſt
hym / and ſhewed hym all thynge yt he knewe.
Whan the erle of ſaynt powle herde the kynge
ſay in that wyſe / he had great marueyle therof / 
and ſayde howe it ought nat to be ſuffred / 
and ſayd. Syr if ye ſuffre this / they wyll dyſtroy
you / it is ſayd in Fraūce howe the duke
of Glouceſtre entendeth to nothynge / but to
breake the peace and to renewe the warre agayne / 
and that lytell and litell he draweth the
hertes of yonge men of the realme to his parte
for they deſyre rather warre than peace / ſo that
the auncyent wyſe men / if the warre beganne
to ſtyrre / they ſhulde nat be herde nor beleued / 
for reaſon / right / nor iuſtyce hath no place nor
audyence / where as yuell reygneth / therfore
prouyde therfore rather betymes than to late.
it were better ye had theym in daunger / than
they you. Theſe wordes of the erle of ſaynte
Powle entered greatly in to the kynges hert / 
and made hym ſore to muſe / and after that
the erle of ſaynt Powle was retourned in to
Fraunce / ye kyng of Englande ſhewed all this
mater to his brother the erle of Huntyngdon / 
who ſaid to the kynge. Syr / my fayre brother
of ſaynt Powle hath ſhewed you the trouth / 
therfore take good aduyſe in this mater.
            ANd as I was enfourmed / aboute a
moneth after that the erle of ſaynte
Powle had ben in Englande and retourned
in to Fraunce / a paryllous fame and
renome ranne vpon the kynge in Englande / 
and in a maner there was a generall brewte
that the erle of ſaynt Powles cōmynge in to
Englande was to treate with the the kynge / 
that the frenche men myght haue Calayes in
to their handes. This brute greatly troubled

and moued the people in Englāde / in ſo moche
that certayne of London roode to Plaſſhey
to the duke of Glouceſtre / and ſhewed
hym of that matter. The duke apeaſed nat
their wordes / but rather augmented it more
and more. Sayenge howe he coulde nat do
therwith / But ſayd he was ſure that the frē
               che
men wolde it hadde coſte theym all their
kynges doughters / ſo that they might haue
Calais at their pleaſure. This anſwere ſet
the Londoners a fyre / and ſayde / howe they
wolde ſpeke with the kynge / and ſhewe hym
howe the realme was nat cōtent. Well quod
the duke ſhewe it hym in good maner / and
make doute that the people wyll nat be contente.
And marke well what anſwere he maketh / 
and ſhewe me therof the nexte tyme I
ſpeke with you / and thervpon I ſhall gyue
you counſayle what ye ſhall do farther. It
maye well be / that there be ſome falſe traytours / 
counſayleth the Kynge to the ſame.
There is the erle Marſhall who is Capytayne
of Calays / who hath been two tymes
in Fraūce and taryed at Parys / and he was
one of the chiefe procurers in the treatie for
the kynges maryage with the doughter of
Fraunce. And theſe Frenche men are ryght
ſubtyle / and can driue their purpoſe a farre
of / and lytell and lytell purſue their ententes
and wyll gyue largely to bringe about their
purpoſe.
            
               ACordynge to the dukes counſayle / 
the Londoners on a daye
wente to Eltham to the kynge / 
at whiche tyme there was the
kynges two bretherne / the erle
of Kent and therle of Huntyngdon / the erle
of Saliſbury / and the archebyſſhoppes of
Caūterbury and of Duuelyn / his confeſſour
the lorde Thomas Percy / the lorde Lyſle / 
Richarde Credon / Iohan Boulofer / and dyuers
other knyghtes of the kynges chambre.
There theſe londoners right wiſely ſhewed
the kynge their ententes in a meke hūble maner / 
and ſayde howe the brute ranne / that the
kynge was about to delyuer vp Calais into
the Frenche mennes handes. The kyng had
great marueile of theſe newes / for it touched
hym nere to the hert. But right ſagely he diſſymuled
the mater for that tyme / and apeſed
the Londoners and ſayd / howe all that noiſe
was wronge / for it was nothyng ſo. But for
trouthe / he ſaid / the erle of ſaynt Poule was
come in to Englande for none other entente / 
but to ſporte hym / and was ſent thider by the
Frenche kynge / to ſe hym and the quene his
wyfe: Other marchaundyſe the kynge ſayde
there was none bytwene them / and that the
kynge ſware / by the faythe that he owed to
god and to the crowne of Englāde / and ſaid
howe he had great marueyle / wherof ſuche
wordes ſhulde ryſe. Than̄e the erle of Saliſbury
ſayde. Sirs / ye good men of London.
Go home to youre houſes / and be well
aſſured / that the kynge and his Counſayle
wyll do nor entende to do any thynge / but
that that ſhalbe for the honour and profite of
this his realme of Englande. And who ſo
euer hath fyrſt brought vp theſe wordes are
yuell coūſayled / and ſhewe well howe they
wolde gladly haue this realme in trouble / &
to haue the people to ryſe agaynſt the kyng / 
whiche thynge ye of London ought to feare
for by reaſon of the laſte rebellyon / ye were
in great paryll / to haue been all vtterly dyſtroyed.
For whan yuell people be vp & gouerne / 
iuſtyce nor reaſon than hath no place.
Thoſe wordes apeaſed greatly the Londoners / 
& were contented with the kynges anſwere / 
and ſo retourned to the cytie of London / 
And the kynge taryed at Eltham ryght
penſyue / and full of diſpleaſure / by reaſon of
the wordes that he had herde / and had ſtylle
about hym his two bretherne / and other ſuche
as he truſted beſte / for he thought hym
ſelfe natte well aſſured amogne his vncles / 
For he ſawe well howe they abſented theym
ſelfe fro his Courte / and kepte them at home
at their owne houſes / ſo that he was halfe in
doute of them / and ſpecially of the duke of
Glouceſtre / And ſo kepte dayly aboute hym
a garde of a thouſande archers.
            YT was enformed the kynge of Englande
of a ſuretie / that his vncle ye
duke of Glouceſtre and the Erle of
Arundell / purpoſed with puiſſaunce of people
to take the kyng and the yong quene and
to putte them in to a caſtell / there to be kepte
ſurely in an honeſt maner with meate & drinke / 
& other neceſſaries. And alſo / howe there
ſhulde be ſet four gouernours in the realme / 

as the duke of Lancaſtre & the duke of yorke
to rewle fro the Temmys northwarde / vnto
the ryuers of Hūbre and Thyne / & of Thay
ronnyng by the cytie of Warwyke / comprehendynge
all the ſignories of Northumberlande / 
and the boundes of Scotlande. And
the duke of Glouceſtre had all the rule of Lō
               don
and of the londoners / and of Eſſexe / cō
               prehendyng
all the boundes of the See / and
thider where as the ryuer of Hūbre entereth
in to the ſee: and alſo of all the portes and hauyns
aboue London to Hampton / & to Cornwall.
And the erle of Arundell / he to haue the
rule of the landes mouynge fro London bytwene
Suſſexe and Kent / Arundell / Surrey / 
Deuonſhyre / and Barkeſhyre / and of
all the hole ſignories / bytwene the ryuer of
Thamyſe and Briſtowe / & the ryuer of Syuerne / 
whiche departeth Englande and Wales.
And they ſhall holde and do iuſtyce and
reaſon to euery man. But their entencyons
is / if they can fynde any reaſonable waye to
moue agayne and to renewe the warre bytwene
Englande and Fraunce / and that if ye
Frēche kyng wolde haue agayne his doughter
he ſhulde / for ſithe ſhe is but eight yeres
of age / paraduēture whan ſhe cometh to .xii.
yeres ſhe may repente her and refuce her mariage / 
bycauſe ſhe was maryed in her youth
And alſo it was no reaſon to diſmary her fro
the heyr of Bretaygne / as it was promiſed.
And if whan ſhe cometh to perfyte age / that
ſhe wyll nat refuce her maryage / Than ſhe
muſt abyde by right ſtyll quene of Englāde / 
and to haue her dowrye / but in no wyſe ſhe
ſhulde be crowned Quene. And that if the
kynge dyed or ſhe came to laufull age / than
they purpoſe to ſende her agayne in to Fraū
               ce
to her father. This was ſhewed to ye king
for ſuche wordes were ſpoken by dyuers Englyſſhe
men / and ſpecially by the londoners
who coude nat loue the kynge. And they repented
them / that whan the cōmons of Suſſexe / 
Kent / and Eſſexe were vp / and came to
London / in that they dyde breake their purpoſe / 
for as ſome of them cōfeſſed / they were
in mynde to haue ſlayne the kyng / the erle of
Saliſbury / the erle of Oxenforde / and all
the kynges counſayle. And if they hadde ſo
done by meanes of the rebellyon / the londoners
than̄e ſhulde ſoone haue made a newe
heed. And by meanes of the duke of Glouceſtre / 
to haue founde ſome perſon to haue had
the crowne and gouernynge of the realme / 
and therby to haue brought the realme into
a better caſe than̄e it was in as than. Thus
the londoners and ſuche other of their ſecte / 
dayly murmured and had many ſecrete coū
               ſayls.
All this the kynge was enformed of / 
and mooſt faute was layde vpon the duke of
Glouceſtre.
            
               KIng Richarde was abaſſhed of
tentymes whan he herde & ſawe
ſuche couert hate and yuell wyll
borne againſt hym. Alwayes he
made louynge countynaunce to
his vncle of Glouceſtre and to the lōdoners / 
but it aueyled hym nothyng. On a daye the
kynge ſayd to his other two vncles / of Lancaſtre
and of yorke. Sirs / on goddes name
I requyre you to gyue me your aduiſe & coū
               ſayls.
I am dayly enformed of aſuretie / that
your brother myne vncle of Glouceſtre / the
erle of Arundell / and their complyces / are
mynded to take me ꝑforce / by the agrement
of the londoners / and purpoſe to cloſe me in
a Caſtell / and to order my fyndynge by certayne
porcion / & my wyfes in lykewiſe / who
is but yonge / and to ſeperate her fro me / and
to kepe her eſtate in another place. Fayre vncles / 
this is a cruell maner and it ought nat
to be ſuffred / as long as I maye withſtande
it. ye haue doone me homage and ſworne to
be trewe to me in the preſence of kynge Edwarde
of good memorie my graūtfather / at
whiche tyme all the great prelates and lordꝭ
of this realme / ſware to kepe and maynteyn
me as their kynge a .xx. yere paſte. Wherfore
fayre vncles / for loue and charyte / and by the
othe and promyſe that ye haue made / counſayle
me trewly as ye are bounde to do. For
as farre as I can ymagin / myne vncle of gloceſtre
entēdeth on none other thing / but how
he might renewe agayne the warre / bitwene
Englande and Fraunce / And to breake the
peace / whiche we haue confyrmed / bothe you
and all other of the realme / by ſweryng and
ſealyng / and by the ſame compoſycion I am
ioyned in maryage to ye doughter of Fraūce
without thynkyng of any yuell. & ye knowe
well / that who ſoeuer dothe contrary to yt he
is ſworne vnto & hath ſealed to the ſame / & ſo
proued / dothe yuell / & ought to be puniſſhed

therfore / bothe in body and goodes. And alſo
ye knowe well yt I forbeare myne vncle of
Glouceſtre as moche as I may do / and take
no regarde to thretnyng / whiche myght coſt
me derely. Vncles / ye are bounde to coūſaile
me ſithe I demaunde it with reaſon. & whan
they herde the kyng ſpeke thus / & ſawe well
howe the mater ſore troubled his mynde and
that it touched hym nere / and alſo they know
well moche of his ſayenge was trewe / they
ſayd. Sir / ſuffre and lette the tyme ryn and
paſſe. We knowe well our brother of Gloceſtre
hath the mooſt paryllous heed & brayne / 
of any manne in Englande. But we knowe
well he can do no more than a man maye do / 
if he buylde on the one ſyde we ſhall buylde
on the other / as long as ye wyll be ordred by
our coūſaile / ye ſhall nat nede to care for our
brother. He ſaythe often tymes many thyngꝭ
wherof foloweth none effecte. He all alone / 
nor they of his counſayle canne nat breke the
peace that is taken / nor can nat encloſe you
in any caſtell. We ſhall neuer ſuffre that / nor
to be ſeperated fro your wyfe / For if he ſaye
ſo and thinke it / he is foule abuſed. Therfore
ſir / we humbly beſeche you to apeace youre
ſelfe / euery thyng ſhall turne well with goddes
grace. All that a man ſpeketh cōmeth nat
to effecte / nor all that he ſayth oftentymes he
can nat accōplyſſhe. Thus the dukes of Lā
               caſtre
and yorke / apeaſed their nephewe kynge
Richarde.
            THeſe two dukes ſawe well / that the
buſyneſſe of Englande began to be
yuell / and parceyued that gret hatered
encreaſed dayly bytwene the kyng & the
duke of Gloceſtre. And to thentent that they
wolde nat entremedell bytwene them / they
departed fro the kynges court with all their
company and ſeruauntes / and ſo toke their
leaue of yt kyng for a tyme / and went to their
owne. And the duke of Lancaſtre toke with
hym his wyfe the lady Katheryn Ruet / who
hadde ben in company with the yong quene
of Englande / and went a huntyng of ye dere:
as the vſage is in Englande / and the kynge
taryed about London. But afterwarde the
kynges vncles repented them that they deꝑted
out of ye courte / for there fell afterwarde
ſuche maters in Englande / that all ye realme
was in trouble / the whiche had nat ſo fortuned
if they had ben about the kynge / for they
wolde haue founde other prouiſyon for y• mater / 
than they dyde that counſayled the kyng
There were none of the kynges ſeruauntes / 
but that greatly douted the duke of Glouceſtre / 
and wolde gladly that he had ben deed / 
they had nat cared howe. the gentyll knight
ſir Thomas Percy had ben long ſouerayne
ſquyer of the kynges houſe (that is in Fraū
               ce
mayſter and ſeneſchall) for all the ſtate of
the kynge paſſed throughe his handes. He
than cōſydring the great hatereddes yt encreſed
bitwene the kyng and his vncle of Gloceſtre / 
and among other great lordes of Englande / 
with whom he was welbeloued. Like
a ſage knight he ymagined that the concluſyons
coude nat be good. Thā he gaue vp his
offyce as honorably as he coulde / and tooke
leaue of the kynge / and the kynge gaue hym
leaue full ſore agaynſt his wyll / howe be it
he made ſuche excuſacions / that he departed
and another ſet in his offyce. The kyng had
as than but yonge counſayle about hym / and
they greatly douted the duke of Glouceſtre / 
and oftentymes wolde ſaye to the kynge.
            Ryght dere ſir / it is a perylous thyng to ſerue
you / for we haue ſene ſuche as haue ſerued
you in tymes paſte / and ſuche as were ryght
ſynguler in your fauoure / yet they haue had

who was a ſage valyaunt knight / & in good

for your fyrſt maryage / yet your vncle
the duke of Glouceſtour cauſed hym to dye
ſhamefully / his heed to be ſtryken of lyke a

whan your vncle cometh to you / the whiche
is nat often / we dare nat lyfte vp our eyen to

we be ſo nere about you as we be. Wherfore
ſir knowe for trouthe / yt as long as he liueth
there ſhall be no peace in Englande / nor ye

ſir / ye be a kyng loſt / if ye take nat good

hede to your ſelf / as for your wife nedeth nat

moche yuell might come therby in Englāde.
your vncle of Glouceſtre / to thentent to make
you to be behated with your people / hath
ſowen dyuers ſclaūdorous wordꝭ vpon you

howe ye be nat worthy to beare ye crowne /

they ſaye / that ye haue brought the realme in

howe it is pytie that ye haue been ſuffred

ye were ſo redy & gladde to take a truce / they
thynke more rather byforce than by loue. for
the noble men of ye realme / who haue ſerued
and maynteyned the warres / neuer agreed
therto. Alſo they ſaye / that ye haue nat dilygently
reuiſyted nor ouerſene the letters patentes /

by kyng Iohan ſomtyme frenche kyng / and
by his ſonnes / the whiche graūt his children

vſurped all the right that your predeceſſurs

of the kyng.
Cap. CC.xxiii.
            
               KIng Richarde of Englād
noted well theſe ſayd
wordes / ye which was ſhewed
hym in ſecreteneſſe / &
lyke an ymaginatyfe price
as he was / within a ſeaſon
after that his vncles of Lā
               caſtre
and of yorke were departed out of the
courte / than the kynge toke more hardyneſſe
on hym / and ſaid to hym ſelfe. That fyrſte it
were better for hym to diſtroye another / rather
than another ſhulde diſtroye hym. thynkynge
that ſhortely he wolde haue his vncle
of Glouceſtre in ſuche caſe / that he wolde be
aſſured of hym / that he ſhulde do hym no diſpleaſure
after. & bycauſe he coulde nat bring
about his purpoſe alone / he dyſcouered his
mynde to ſuch as he truſted beſt: as to therle
marſhall his coſyn erle of Notyngham / and
ſhewed hym his full mynde what he wolde
do and haue to be doone. The erle marſhall
(who loued the kyng better than the duke of
Gloceſtre dyde) kepte the kynges purpoſe ſecrete / 
ſauīg to ſuche as he wolde be ayded by
for he coude nat do ye kynges pleaſure alone.
On a day the kyng in maner as goyng a hū
               tynge / 
he rode to Haueryng of Boure / a .xx.
myle fro London in Eſſexe / and within .xx.
myle of Plaſſhey / where the duke of Glouceſtre
helde his houſe. After dyner the kyng deꝑted
fro haueryng with a ſmall cōpany & cāe
to Plaſſhey about .v. a clocke: ye weder was
fayre & hote. ſo the kyng cāe ſodainly thyder
about the tyme that the duke of Glouceſtre
had ſupped / for he was but a ſmall eater / nor

ſatte neuer long at dyner nor at ſupper. whā
he herde of the kynges cōmynge / he went to
mete with hym in the myddes of the court / &
ſo dyde the ducheſſe & her chyldren / and they
welcomed the kynge: and the kynge entred in
to the hall / & ſo in to a chambre. Thā a borde
was ſpredde for the kynges ſupper. The kynge
ſatte nat longe. And ſayd at his fyrſt commyng.
Fayre vncle / cauſe fyue or ſixe horſes
of yours to be ſadylled / for I wyll praye you
to ryde with me to London / for to morowe
the londoners wyll be before vs. And there
wyll be alſo myne vncles of Lācaſtre & yorke
with dyuers other noble men. For vpon the
londoners requeſtes I wyll be ordred accordyng
to your counſayle / and cōmaunde your
ſtewarde to folowe you with your trayne to
lōdon / where they ſhall fynde you. the duke
who thought none yuell / lightly agreed to ye
kynge. And whan the kyng had ſupped and
ryſen / euery thynge was redy. The kynge
than toke leaue of the ducheſſe and of her children / 
and lepte a horſbacke and ye duke with
hym / accompanyed all onely but with ſeuyn
ſeruauntes / thre ſquyers and foure yeomen / 
and tooke the waye of Bondelay / to take the
playne waye / and to eſchewe Brēdwode and
London cōmon hyghe waye. So they rode
a great pace and talked by the way with his
vncle / and he with hym / and ſo aproched to
Stratforde on the ryuer of Thamiſe. Whan
the kyng came nere to the buſſhment that he
had layde / than he rode fro his vncle a great
pace / and lefte hym ſomwhat behynde hym.
Than ſodaynly the erle Marſhall with his
bande came galopyng after the duke / and ouertoke
hym and ſaide. Sir / I areſt you in
the kynges name. The duke was abaſſhed
with that worde / and ſawe well he was betrayed / 
and began to call loude after ye kyng / 
I can nat tell wheder the kyng herde hym or
nat / but he turned nat / but rode for the rather
faſter than he dyde before. ¶Nowe lette vs
leaue ſpekyng of this mater for a ſeaſon / tyll
we retourne therto agayne.
            YE haue herde before in this hiſtorie / 
howe ſir Iohn̄ of Caſtell morant
and ſir Iaques of Helley were
ſente in to Turkey to Lamorabaquy / fro the
frenche kyng and fro the duke of Burgoyne / 
and howe they had ſpedde. Whan they were
retourned in to Fraunce / they were welcome
to the kyng and to the duke of Burgoyne / &
to the duches / bicauſe they brought certayne
tidynges fro the erle of Neuers / and fro the
lordes that were there with hym. They ſaid
to the kyng / howe they truſted that Lamorabaquy
wolde gladly treat for their raūſoms
And yt they ſayd they knewe by ſome yt were
of his priuye coūſayle / for they feare leſt they
ſhulde dye in priſone / bycauſe they be out of
their owne naturall ayre. And the Turkes
thynke that by their delyueraūce / they ſhuld
haue great fynaunce for their raunſome. By
reaſon of theſe wordes / the kynge / the duke
of Burgoyne / and the ducheſſe his wyfe / ſtudyed
nyght and day / howe and by what meanes
they might haue their ſonne & heyre delyuered.
And ſayde oftentymes / that the iourney
and ſiege before Nicopoly had coſt them
ouer moche. For therby they hadde deed thre
bretherne baſtarde knyghtes valyaunt men / 
whom they entierly loued. The fyrſt the Haſell
of Flaunders. The ſeconde ſir Loyes of
Brieſe. And the thyrde ſir Iohan of Ipre.
There was another the yongeſt / who was
ſtyll at home. To ſaye the trouthe / ye duches
of Burgoyne coūteſſe of Flaunders ſtudyed
on her ſyde / howe to delyuer her ſonne. And
ſo moche they ſtuyed / that at laſt they founde
the meanes to agre with the turkes with moche
payne. But that was nat ſodaynly done
for the mater was ſuche / that it re
                  •
               red great
leyſar / and to be gote lytell and lytell.
            In this ſame ſeaſon in the cytie of Burſe in
Turkey / dyed ye gentyll knyght Fraūces Anguerant
lorde of Coucy erle of Saiſo
                  •
               s / he
was a great lorde in Fraunce / for as ſir Robert
of Deane (who was ſent by the lady of
Coucy) was goyng to hym warde / he herde
by the way howe he was deed / & that he herd
at Vyen in Auſtriche. And ſo he returned in
to Fraunce / & ſhewed this to certayne of the
lorde Coucies lynage / but nat to the good lady
his wyfe / vntyll ſuche tyme as the chatellayne
of ſaynt Goubayne was ſent to fetche
his deed body enbaulmed in to Fraūce / to be
buryed in thabbey of Nogent beſyde Coucy
and there he was receyued by the ducheſſe of
Bare and the byſſhop of Leon / & by dyuers
other abbottes: and there this gētyll knight
was buryed / in the yere of grace a thouſāde
thre hundred fourſcore and ſeuyntene.
            
               
YE maye well knowe that the Frenche
kyng and the duke of Burgoyn
alwayes ymagyned / howe to gette
their frendes out of priſon in Turkey. Sir
Dyne of Reſpōde was alwayes in their coū
               ſayls / 
and he ſayd euer that the marchaūtes
veniſyās and genowayes / myght well helpe
and ayde in that buſyneſſe. For he ſayd / marchauntes
myght go whider they lyſt / and by
them myght well be knowen the dealyng of
the turkes and tartaries / with ye portes and
paſſages of the kynges ſoudans and miſcreantes / 
and ſpecially they reſorted to Quaire
to Alexandre / to Dāmas / to Antyoche / and
in to the great puiſſaunt cyties of the Sarazins / 
dayly they paſſe and repaſſe. And daylye
marchauntes chriſtened hath entrecours
with the ſarazins / and exchaunge one with a
nother their marchaundyſe. So the frenche
kynge and the duke of Burgoyne ſought all
the frendes and meanes they coulde gette to
forther them: and as than hadde no deſyre to
make warre vpon the duke of Myllayne / bycauſe
they vnderſtode that he was gret with
Lamorabaquy. On the otherſyde kyng Iames
if Cypre / thought well he ſhulde haue
great thanke of the Frenche kyng and of the
duke of Burgoyne / if he myght aſſwage the
furour of Lamorabaquy / and bringe hym to
ſome good reſonable poynt / for the redemynge
of the lordes of Fraunce / ſuche as he had
in priſone. And to pleaſe them / the kynge of
Cypre cauſed a ſhyppe to be made of fyne
golde / right noble and riche / of ye value well
to the ſome of tenne thouſande ducates / whiche
ſhyppe he ſente to Lamorabaquy by his
owne knightes. This ſhyppe was ſo goodlye
& fayre / that it was great ioye to beholde
it / the whiche gyfte the ſoudan toke in gree / 
and ſente agayne to the kynge of Cypre the
double in value therof. All this was anone
knowen in Fraūce / by marchauntes yt wrote
therof to Dyne of Reſponde / to the entente
that he ſhulde ſhewe it to the Frenche kyng
and to the duke of Burgoyn / to haue a thanke
of the kynge.
            THis kyng of Cypre had good cauſe
thus to do / for he was in doute of ye
frenche kynges diſpleaſure / bicauſe
he cauſed to be ſlayne & murdered by night / 
his brother the valyaunt kynge Peter / who
dyde moche trouble to the Sarazins / & toke
Saptalye and Alexandre. The Sarazins
douted hym more than any other kyng or emperour
chriſtened / bicauſe of his valyātneſſe
of the whiche dede this ſayde kynge Iames
ſore repented hym ſelfe / and knewe well he
had done yuell. And after the ſame dede he
fledde out of Cypre / or els the Chriſten men
wolde haue ſlayne hym. So he entred in to
a galley of Gene / beyng at the porte of Nicopoſſie / 
and ſo wente to Genes and the genowayes
receyued hym. And ſome ſaid / that he
dyde that foule murdre by the entyſement of
the genoways / for anone after the genouois
came with puiſſaunce of men of warre and
galyes / and toke the cytie of Famagous and
the porte / and kepte it with puyſſaunce.
            This kynge of Cypre had a fayre yonge
ſonne. The Cyprience crowned this chylde
kynge / and after his crownyng he lyued nat
long / but dyed ſoone after. And aft his dethe
the genouois with great puyſſaūce brought
this Iaques in to Cypre and crowned hym
kyng / and ſo he reigned kyng of Cypre. And
the genowayes alwayes ſuſteyned hym agaynſt
all men / but they wolde neuer rendre vp
the Cytie of Famagous nor the porte / but
helde it ſtyll at the tyme that ye auctour wrot
this hyſtorie. And to ſaye the trouthe / if the
genowayes had nat had it / the Turkes had
wonne it longe before and all the realme of
Cipre / & had brought it in to their obeyſaūce
and by all lykelyhode had ſubdued the yſles
of Rodes / and all other yſles encloſed in the
See to Venyce / but alwayes the genoways
and veniſyās reſyſted them. And whan they
ſawe that the turkes had wonne the Realme
of Armony / than they toke the ſtrong towne
of Corque in Hermyne on the See ſyde / and
ſo helde it / ſo that and it had nat ben for dout
of the paſſage and ſtraytes of Corque and
of Xere before Cōſtantyne the noble / the turkes
had ſore entred in to Chriſtendome / and
vpon the border of the ſee / the whiche ſhulde
haue been great preiudyce to the yſle of Rodes / 
and to the yſles adioynyng. Thus by
theſe meanes the fronters of Chriſten
dome were kepte and defended.
¶Nowe let vs retourne
to our purpoſe.
            
               
               THis kyng Iaques of Cyper who
knewe hym ſelfe gylcy of the deth
of the kynge his brother / wherby
he had the hatred of all other cryſten
kynges / therfore he dyd as
moche as he coude do to get agayne their loue
and fauour / and tooke it for a great honoure
that the frenche kynge wrote fyrſt to hym / for
he douted him moſt of all / and ſo he had cauſe / 
for the duke of Burbone by ryght ſucceſſyon
of the lynage of Luſygnan / ought to be kynge
there and his heyres / for thoughe this kynge
Iaques was brother to the kyng Peter of Cyper / 
yet he had no ryght to the crowne / for he
was but a baſtarde / and all this knewe ryght
well the genouoys / ſo that whan he was made
kynge / there was made a great alyaunce bytwene
them confermed nat to be broken / and
the genouoys to defēde and kepe him and his
heyres agaynſt all other / and therby they atteygned
great ſygnories and frauncheſſes in
the realme of Ciper / and all that euer they dyd
to the exaltynge of this Iaques kynge of Cyper
was alwayes for their owne chiefe auauntage / 
and to be ſtronge againſt the venycians
and to haunte and erercyſe their feate of marchaundyſe
in to the Sarazyns landes. This
kinge Iaques as longe as he lyued dyd what
he coulde to pleaſe the Frenche kynge / by the
meanes of the genouoys / for they wolde in no
wyſe dyſpleaſe hym / and therfore the ſame ſeaſon
this kynge Iaques ordeyned this ſhyppe
of golde to preſente Lamorabaquy / to haue
loue and acquayntaūce with him / whiche gyft
was ioyfully receyued and moch prayſed with
the turkes / and it was thought that the lorde
Dyne of Rreſponde was meanes therof / and
wrote therin to the genouoys / for in this maner
and otherwayes he laboured all that he
myght for the delyueraunce of the erle of Neuers
and of the other lordes of Fraunce.
            WHan the duke of Burgoyne and the
ducheſſe his wyfe ſawe that Lamorabaquy
began to fall to treatie for
the cryſten priſoners / the newes therof was
greatly to their pleaſure / and apoynted a ſage
valyaunt knyght of the countie of Flaunders
called ſyr Gylberte of Linrenghen / who was
ſouerayne of Flaunders vnder the duke and
ducheſſe. And than they ſent for ſyr Iaques of
Helley / bycauſe he knewe the wayes and paſſages / 
and deſyred hym to acompany ſyr Gylberte
to treate with Lamorabaquy / for the delyueraunce
of the cryſten priſoners / and promyſed
hym that his payne ſhulde be well conſydred
and rewarded. Syr Iaques promyſed
them ſo to do. So theſe two knyghtes departed
and rode ſo longe that they came in to
the realme of Hungery / and ſo drewe to the
kynge / for they had letters to hym. The kyng
receyued them ioyouſly for loue of the frenche
kynge / and alſo he knewe well ſyr Iaques of
Helley. There they ſhewed the kyng the cauſe
of their cōmynge out of Fraunce / and howe
they were ſente in to Turkey to treate for the
delyueraunce of the erle of Neuers / and the other
lordes of Fraūce / if Lamorabaquy wolde
gyue them the herynge. The kynge ſayde it
was well done to redeme them if they myght
be put to raunſome / and ſayd in the aſſayenge
therof they coulde leſe nothynge. beſydes that
the kinge offred them his body and goodes to
ayde theym in all maners. Wherof theſe two
knyghtes thanked hym. To entre in to this
treatye with Lamorabaquy / or they coulde
come therto / theſe knightes had moche payne
and made great d
                  ••
               ygēce / for fyrſt ſyr Iaques
of Helley was fayne to go to Lamorabaquy
to requyre a ſafe conducte for his companyon
ſyr Gylbert to come in to Turkey. And whan
he had ateyned it / than he returned in to Hungery / 
and ſo they rode than into Turkey. The
ſouerayne of Flaunders was receyued of Lamorabaquy
and of his men ryght nobly / and
was herde ſpeke / and ſo lytell and lytell they
entred in to their treatie. the ſame tyme there
haunted in to Turkey a marchaunt genouoy
of the iſle of Sio / vnder the obeyſaunce of the
genouoys. This marchaūt was named Bartylmew
Pologrine / and he was well be loued
in Turkey / and namely with Lamorabaquy.

eche other / & to the entent to pleaſe the frenche

and other ladies in Fraūce / ſuche as had their
huſbandes and frendes in priſon in Turkey / 
and in truſt to be well rewarded for his good

payed and delyuered. By theſe wordes
(written by ſyr Dyne of Reſponde) the ſayde
marchaunt genouoye enclyned to his deſyre / 
and on the truſte to be well rewarded of the
frenche kynge / for he thought to ſuche a kyng
it was good to 
                  •
               ay 
                  •
               are. And alſo as I was enfourmed
the kynge of Cyper at the deſyre of
the frenche kynge and the duke of Burgoyne / 
he ſente men of his ſpecyciall counſayle in to
Turkey. And in lykewyſe ſyr Mathelyn and
the lorde of Damyne / two great barones in
Grece and in good fauoure with Lamorabaquy / 
traueyled greatly to auaunce this treatie
to thentent to do pleaſure to the frenche kynge
for without ſuche meanes the mater ſhulde neuer
haue been brought aboute / bycauſe Turkey
is a great coūtrey and yuell for men to traueyle
in / that hath nat ben accuſtomed therto.
Whan Lamorabaquy was ones condyſcended
to entre in to this treatie / than it was ordeyned
by his counſayle that all the chryſten
priſoners ſhulde be brought togyder in to the
cytie of Burſe / and there to cōclude their treatie.
So the priſoners were brought thyder / 
who were in nombre a .xxv. but in their commynge
thyder the turkes that brought them / 
dyd yuell entreate theym / and bete them forwarde / 
for they were but caſely horſed / they
coulde nat go but a pace. the turkes 
                  •
               ete them
bycauſe they ſawe they ſhulde de delyuered / 
wherwith they were ſore dyſpleaſed.
            WHan theſe knightꝭ were thus brought
in to the cytie of Burſe in Turkey / 
Than they that were ſent thyder fro
the Frenche kynge and fro the duke of Burgoyne / 
fro the kynge of Cypers / and fro the
genouoys and venycyens / receyued theſe priſoners
gētylly / ſo that they were more at their
caſe than in the priſone that they were in before
howe be it they were kept euer ſo ſtrayte
that they coulde nat haue the thyrde parte of
their wylles. Lamorabaquy moſte ſpecyally
herde euer the ſoueraygne of Flaunders / for
ſyr Iaques of Helley hadde enfourmed hym
howe he was one of the chyefe of counſayle
with the duke of Burgoyne. Lamorabaquy
was in a Caſtell beſyde Burſe / and thyther
came the ſayde meſſangers. As laſte it was a
greed that theſe .xxv. priſoners ſhulde pay the
ſōme of two hundred thouſande ducates / for
the whiche ſōme the lordes of Mathelyn and
Damyne in Grece / and the marchaunt genouoy
of Sio / became dettours for the ſame / 
and taryed in pledge with Lamorabaquy.
And the erle of Neuers ſware and boūde him
ſelfe to the ſayd marchauntes / that as ſone as
he came to Venyce / nat to departe thens tyll
the money were payed. Thus concluded this
treatie / but or it was all concluded the erle of
Ewe was ſo ſpeke and feble by the alteracyon
of the ayre and courſe meates / that he dyed at
Loge in Grece / where he was kept priſoner / 
wherof all his company were ryght ſory / but
they coulde nat amende it. Thus ſyr Phylyppe
of Arthois erle of Ewe and conſtable of
Fraunce / after he was deed was enbawmed / 
and ſo brought in to Fraunce / and buryed in
the churche of ſaynt Laurence of Ewe. Whan
Lamorabaquy was contented with the marchaundes
bondes for the det of the ſayd ſōme / 
the ſoueraygne of Flaunders and ſir Iaques
of Helley tooke their leaue to retourne in to
Fraunce / and Lamorabaquy was well contente
therwith / and ordeyned that theſe two
knightes ſhuld haue of the ſōme that he ſhuld
receyue / twenty thouſande ducates to be rebated
of the hole ſome. For this kyng Baſaache
conſydered the payne and traueyle that they
had endured / and ſpecyally the ſoueraygne of
Flaunders was greatly in his fauour. Theſe
two knyghtes thanked the kynge of his gyft / 
than they toke their leaue of hym / and afterwarde
of the Frenche knyghtes and lordes.
Whan they were departed fro the kynge they
came to the cytie of Burſe / and than departed
and lefte the erle of Neuers and the lordes of
Fraunce ſtyll in the cytie of Burſe / for they taryed
for the lordes of Mathelyn and Damine
who ſhuld come thyder by ſee to receyue them
in to their galees. And theſe two knyghtes
toke a galee paſſenger to ſayle to Mathelyn.
At their departynge fro the porte the wether
was fayre and temperate / but whanne they
were abrode in the ſee the wynde chaunged / 
and had a marueylous great tempeſt / ſo that
the ſoueraigne of Flaunders by reaſon of ſore
traueyle in that tempeſt / he fell ſore ſycke on
the ſee / and dyed or they came to Mathelyn / 
wherof ſyr Iaques of Helley was 
                  •
               ight ſory / 

but there was no remedy / and ſo ſayled forthe
in a galee of Venyce / and paſſed by Rodes / 
and alwayes as he went he publyſſhed the redempcyon
of the lordes of Fraunce / wherof
they of Rodes were ryght ioyfull. At laſt this
knyght came in to Fraunce / and ſhewed the
kynge and the other lordes and ladyes howe
he had ſpedde / wherof the kynge and other
were right ioyfull / and thanked the knyght of
his traueyle and payne he had taken in that
iourney.
            WHan the redempcyon of theſe lordes
and knyghtes of Fraunce was at apoynt
/ than Lamorabaquy thought
or they departed to haue them in his company
and that they ſhulde be more at large and
better entreated than they were before / as it
was reaſon / ſythe they were no lenger priſoners / 
he thought they ſhulde ſe parte of his puyſſaunce
and ſtate / whiche was as it was ſhewed
me / marueylous great and ſumptuous / 
and kepte moche people dayly aboute hym.
Thus he ſent of the noble men of his houſe to
bring them to his preſence / to whom he made
good chere / and had euery thynge delyuered
them of the ordinary of his courte / acordynge
to the vſage of the countrey / and euery daye
the kynge talked with the erle of Neuers by
a truchman / and greatly he honoured the erle
of Neuers / for he ſawe well he was lyke to be
a great man in Fraunce / and ſonne to a great
lord/wherof he was well enfourmed / the whiche
he founde true / by reaſon of the great ſute
that was made for their redempcyon / and by
the great ſōme of money that they agreed to
paye. The erle of Neuers and his company
had great marueyle of the great ſtate that he
kept / he and his people laye euer in the felde / 
for no towne coulde ſuffyce them. The ſpence
of his howſeholde and charge of meate and
drinke / was marueyle to conſydre fro whence
it ſhulde come / but that the countrey is ſo hote
that the people be of ſobre dyet / and vſe moche
ſpycery / and ſpecyally ſuger and gotes mylke
wherof they haue great haboundaunce / the
whiche is cōmon drinke of the ſarazyns / and
they haue plenty of bredde / made of a grayne
called mylle / he had euer aboute hym a ſeuen
thouſande fawconers and as many hunters.
So it was on a daye he wente a hawkynge / 
and had a flyght with a fawcon at an Egle in
the preſence of the erle of Neuers / the whiche
flyght pleaſed nat Lamorabaquy / wherwith
he was ſore dyſpleaſed / and as it was ſhewed
me / for the ſame faute there was at the poynte
a two thouſande fauconers to haue loſte their
heedes / bearyng them in hande that they were
nat dylygent in kepynge of his hawkes. Another
tyme in the preſence of the erle of Neuers
a woman came to complayne to the kynge / deſyringe
to haue ryght and iuſtyce vpon a ſeruaunt
of his / ſayenge. Syr kynge / I come to
you as to my ſoueraygne / I complayne me
of a ſeruaunt of your chambre / as it is ſhewed
me / he is come this ſame day in to my howſe / 
and the mylke of a gote that I had for me and
my chyldren / he hath dronken it agaynſt my
wyll. and ſyr / I ſaid to him that if he wolde do
me that wronge / I wolde complayne to you / 
and as ſoone as I ſayde ſo / he gaue me two
great blowes / & wolde nat forbeare for all that
I ſpake in your name / therfore ſyr kynge do
me iuſtyce / as ye are ſworne to do to all your
people. The kinge marked well the womans
wordes / and ſo cauſed his ſeruaunte to come
a fore hym / and the woman alſo / and than he
cauſed the woman to renewe her complaynt.
The ſeruaunt began to excuſe hym / and ſayd
that he knewe nothynge of that matter. The
woman ſpake wyſely and affyrmed her wordes
to be trewe. Than the kynge ſayde / woman
aduyſe ye well / for if I fynde thy wordes
vntrewe / thou ſhalte dye an yuell dethe. Syr
quod ſhe I am content / for if my wordes were
nat true / what nede me to come in to your preſēce / 
do me iuſtyce I deſyre none other thyng.
Thou ſhalt haue iuſtyce quod the kynge / for
I haue ſworne ſo to do to euery man and woman.
Than the kynge cauſed the man to be
taken and cauſed his bely to be opened / to ſe if
he had eaten or dronken the mylke or nat / and
there he founde that he had dronke the mylke
for it was nat turned to digeſtyon. And whan
the kyng ſawe that the womans wordes were
trewe / he ſaid to her / thou haddeſt good cauſe
to complayne / go thy way quyte thou art well
reuenged of the treſpaſe that was done
to the / and ſhe had a good recompence / 
and the man deed.
This iudgement
the lordes
of Fraunce ſawe
and herde.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe the lordes of Fraunce returned
by ſee to Venyce / and of the iſles
they founde by the waye.
Cap. CC.xxiiii.
            
               WHan the Erle of Neuers
and the other lordes of
Fraūce / who had ben taken
priſoners at the batayle before
Nycopoly in Turkey / 
whan they had ſene a ſeaſon
the ſtate and maner of
Lamorabaquy / and that he was content of euery
thynge / and vnderſtode that the lorde of
Mathelyn and the lorde of Damyne / and the
marchaunt of Sio were come to Burſelle in
Turkey / than he gaue them leaue to departe.
So they came all togyther before Lamorabaquy / 
excepte the erle of Ewe and the lorde of
Coucy / who were bothe deed / thus they toke
their leaue and thanked hym of his curteſies.
Than Lamorabaquy ſaid to therle by a truch
man. Iohan I knowe well thou arte a great
lorde in thy Countrey / and ſonne to a great
lorde / thou art yonge / and pe
                  •
                aduenture ſhall
beare ſome blame and ſhame that this aduenture
hath fallen to the in thy fyrſte chyualry / 
and to excuſe thy ſelfe of this blame and to recouer
thyne honour / peraduenture thou wylt
aſſemble a puyſſaunce of men / and come and
make warre agaynſt me / if I were in doute or
feare therof / or thou departed I ſhulde cauſe
the ſwere by thy lawe and faythe yt neuer thou
nor none of thy company ſhulde beare armure
or make warre agaynſt me / but I wyll nother
make ye nor none of thy company to make any
ſuche othe or promeſſe / but I wyll that whan
thou arte retourned and arte at thy pleaſure / 
rayſe what puyſſaunce thou wylte and ſpare
nat but come agaynſt me / thou ſhalt fynde me
alwayes redy to receyue the and thy company
in the felde in playne batayle / and this that I
ſay ſhewe it to whome thy lyſte / for I am able
to do dedes of armes / and euer redy to conquere
further in to cryſtendome. Theſe hygh
wordes the erle of Neuers vnderſtode well / 
and ſo dyd his company / they thought on it after
as longe as they lyued. Than they tooke
their leaue / and they were conducted with a
great nombre / vnder the leadynge of Aſſybaathe
and Surbaſaache / and ſo delyuered to
the lordes of Mathelyn and Damyne / who
were cauſe of their delyueraunce / and whan
their galees were redy they entred / and their
conducte retourned to their kynge. So they
ſayled tyll they came to ye porte of Mathelyn / 
where they were receyued with great ioye.
            THe lady of Mathelyn was ryght honourable
and gentle / & as well aſſured
of her ſelfe as any lady in Grece / 
for in her youth ſhe had ben brought vp in the
emperour of Conſtantyne the nobles courte / 
with the lady Mary of Burbone / where ſhe
had lerned moche norture / for in Fraunce the
lordes and ladyes be more honourable / than
in many other coūtreys. This lady was right
ioyouſe to ſe in her houſe the erle of Neuers / 
and ſyr Henry of Bare / ſir Guy of Tremoyle
and the other / ſhe receyued them ryght honourably
with great ioy / and dyd what ſhe coude
to do them pleaſure. Firſt ſhe newly aparelled
all the lordes and knyghtes of Fraunce with
ſhyrtes / gownes / and other aparell of fyne damaſke / 
acordynge to the vſage of Grece / and
all other euery man after his degre. The lady
ſpared nothyng on them / wherfore they gaue
her great thanke / and greatly prayſed her eſtate
and ordre. In lykewyſe they thāked and
prayſed the lordes of Mathelyn and of Damyne / 
who made them good chere and honourable.
Anone tydynges of their delyueraunce
was knowen at the Rodes / wherof the great
mayſter of the Roodes and all the knyghtes
there were ryght ioyfull / and they determyned
to arme forth two galees / and to ſende for
theym to come in to the iſle of Rodes / and ſo
they dyd / and in the one galee they ſette ſyr Iaques
of Braſſemont a burgonyon marſhall of
the Rodes. So longe they ſayled and rowed
that they aryued at Mathelyn. The marſhall
was well receyued of euery man and of the lady
of Mathelyn. Than theſe lordes and other
refreſſhed them there a foure dayes / and on
the fyfte daye their galees were redy. Than
the erle of Neuers tooke leaue of the lady of
Mathelyn / and thanked her greatly and the
lordes alſo / and the erle of Neuers ſayd that
he was bounde for euer towne them his good
wyll. The lady anſwered wyſely to them all.
So they entred in to the Galees in the porte
of Mathelyn / and had wynde and wether at

wyll / and ſayled ſo longe that without daunger
or dōmage they came and aryued in the
iſle of the Rodes / in the ſame place where as
all galees do aryue cōmynge fro Cyper / or fro
Barne / and fro other partes of the ſee Orientall.
There were many of the knyghtes of the
Roodes / who be or ought to be men of valyaunt
corage / for they beare the whyte Croſſe / 
in ſignyfieng of the croſſe of Chriſt / who dyed
and toke payne for the redempcyon of all cryſten
people / and nere hande daily theſe knightes
haue ſkrymyſſhes and aſſawtes to ayde
and ſuſtayne the chryſten faythe agaynſt the
myſcreaūtes / wherfore theſe knyghtes ought
to be valyaunte men / and nouryſſhed in the
warre.
            
               WHan the erle of Neuers and his
company were come in to the iſle
of Rodes / the great mayſter and
the great priour of Acquytanye / 
who was there / receyued the frenche
men honourably / and offred to lende them
golde and ſyluer to paye their ſmall charges
and coſtes / whiche offre the erle of Neuers
and his company toke for a great curteſy / and
hertely thanked them / for they had great nede
therof▪ the great priour of Acquytanie a right
valyaunt knyght lente to the erle of Neuers a
thyrty thouſande frankes in redy money / and
ſyr Reygnere Potte ſtewarde with the erle of
Neuers and the lorde of Rocheforde of Burgoyne
receyued the money. I thynke it was
generally for them all / that euery man ſhulde
haue parte / but the erle became dettour for the
money. Thus they taryed in the Iſle of Rodes
a good ſeaſone to refreſſhe theym / and to
ſette euery thynge in good ordre / for the ayre
was more attēperate there than whe
                  •
                as they
had ben in Turkey. And as they taryed thus
at Rodes abydynge for the galees of Venyce
a ſyckeneſſe toke ſyr Guy of Tremoyle lorde
of Seully / of whiche ſyckneſſe he dyed there / 
and was buryed in the churche of ſaynte Iohan
in the Rodes / and the lordes of Fraunce
dyd his obſequy ryght reuerently / and were
ryght ſorye of his dethe / but there was no remedy.
The Erle of Neuers knewe well that
the duke of Burgoyne wolde be ſore dyſpleaſed
of his deth / bycauſe he had always foūde
hym ſage and of good counſayle. At the laſte
there aryued the galees of Venyce wherof the
frenche men were ryght ioyous. Than they
tooke their leaue of the lordes of the Rodes.
Thus departed the erle of Neuers / ſir Henry
of Bare / Boucyquante / Guillyam of Tremoyle / 
the lorde of Rocheforde and all other.
The patrones of the galees (to do them pleaſure)
were contente to ſuffre them to refreſſhe
theym in the iſles bytwene Venyce and Rodes.
Fyrſte they came to Modon a fyue hundred
myle fro the Roodes / and there they refreſſhed
them. it parteyned to the venycyens.
            
               ANd fro modon they ſayled with
wynde and wether at wyll / and
ſo came to the iſle of Calefo / and
there refreſſhed theym. And fro
thence to the iſle of Garre / and
there taryed / and than they came to the iſle of
Chyfolignie and there landed / and founde a
great nombre of Ladyes and damoſels / who
had the ſygn
                  •
               orite of that iſle. They receyued
the frenche men with great ioye / and brought
them to paſſe the tyme aboute the iſle / whiche
is ryght fayre and pleaſaunte. And ſuche as
knowe the condycions of that iſle / affyrmeth
that the fayry and the nympes be moche conuerſaunt
there. Some of the marchauntes of
Venyce and Geane and of other landes / ſuche
as haue aryued there / and taryed there a ſeaſone
to eſchewe the daunger of the ſee / haue
ſaid that they haue ſene ſome of the fairy there
and haue proue
                  •
                their wordes to be trewe.
The erle of Neuers and his company were
right ioyouſe of the company of theſe ladyes / 
and ryght ioyouſly the ladyes receyued them / 
and ſayd howe their cōmynge thyder dyd all
the iſle great honoure / bycauſe they were noble
knyghtes and men of honoure / for there
hath nat acuſtomed none other to be conuerſaunt
amonge them / but marchauntes. This
iſle is nat all onely enhabyted with women / 
but there be men amonge them / but the women
haue the ſoueraynte and chefe rule there.
They are worke women in ſylke worke / and
make clothes of ſylke / ſo ſubtelly and ſo well / 
that there is none lyke them / nor the men of
the iſle canne nat make it / but they cary them
out to ſell where they thynke to haue moſt profyte / 
and the woman abyde ſtyll in ye iſle / and
they honour the men for the ſayde cauſe / and
they haue the profyte therof. The Iſle is of
that condycion that no man dare aproche it to

do there any dōmage / for who ſo euer dothe
are peryſſhed / and that hath ben ſene and proued / 
and therfore theſe ladyes endure euer in
peace / and dought no man. Alſo they are marueylous
ſwete / gentle / amyable / and humble / 
and whan they wyll they ſpeke with the fayry
and be in their company.
            WHan the erle of Neuers and his company
had refreſſhed them in this iſle
of Chyfoligne aboute a fyue dayes / 
than they toke leaue of theſe ladyes / and lefte
amonge theſe ladyes parte of ſuche as they
had that they myght forbeare / ſo that the ladyes
gaue them great thanke at their departynge / 
and ſo they ſayled to a lande called Raguſe / 
and there they reſted. And fro thens to
Clarence / a hundred myle fro Venyce. And
whyle they were there thyther came a ſquyer
of Haynalt of great recōmendacyon / borne in
the towne of Mons / he was called Brydoll / 
he came fro the holy ſcpulcre / and fro Quayre
and fro ſaynt Katheryns mounte / and whan
he came to Clarence the frenchmen made him
good chere / bycauſe he was borne in Haynalt / 
for the counteſſe of Neuers was doughter to
the erle of Heynalte / and alſo bycauſe he had
ben in farre countreys / and they demaunded
of him newes fro thoſe parties / and alſo of the
ſtate of the kynge of Cyper. He aunſwered to
euery thynge ryght wyſely.
            
               WHan the erle of Neuers had refreſſhed
hym there a ſeaſon / than
he ſayled forthe and came to the
porte of Parcuſe. The great galees
coude go no further to come
to ye porte of Venyce. Than within a certayne
ſpace they tooke other ſmall ſhyppes paſſengers
and ſo came to Venyce / and there were
receyued with great ioye / and they thanked
god that they were come thyder in ſauegarde
and out of the handes of the myſcreauntes / for
they were ones in feare / neuer to haue come
out of their handes. Than euery man wente
to his logynge which was prepared for them / 
for their commynge thyder was knowen before / 
their ſeruauntes were come thyder and
prepared for them redye agaynſt their commyng.
The erle of Neuers founde there redy
parte of his ſeruauntes / ſente thyder by the
duke of Burgoyne his father and the duches
his mother. Alſo there was redy ſyr Dyne of
Reſponde bycauſe of their raunſome. Than
clerkes were ſette to write letters / and meſſangers
were ſente forthe to gyue knowledge to
their frendes of their comynge. Theſe newes
was anone knowen ouer all. the duke of Burgoyne
and the ducheſſe ordeyned for the ſtate
of their ſonne / as veſſell / and plate of ſyluer
and golde / aparell / and ſtuffe of houſholde all
this was ſent to Venyce on ſōmers / and the
lorde of Angyers and ſyr Iaques of Helley
dyd conuey all this ſtuffe / and ſo came to Venyce.
And all the other lordes and knyghtes
frendes dyd ſende thyder in lyke maner. And
ye maye beleue well that this was nat dooue
without great coſte / for there was nothynge
ſpared and alſo they laye at Venyce at great
coſte and charge / for Venyce is one of the dereſt
townes in the world for ſtraungers to lye
in. Thus theſe lordes kept their eſtates there / 
and therle of Neuers was more charged than
any other / as it was reaſone / for he was the
chiefe there. The duke of Burgoyne and the
ducheſſe ſette all their ententes for the delyueraunce
of their ſonne / for they deſyred greatly
to ſe theym and ſo dyd many other / and the
duke ſayd that without ayde of his men and
good frendes that were in his landes / as well
in Burgoyne as in Arthoys / and in Flaunders / 
he coulde nat tell howe to atteyne to the
ſomme of money that Lamorabaquy ſhulde
haue for his ſonnes raunſome / and to beare
the coſtes that dayly grewe by that occaſyon / 
for though their raunſomes drewe but to two
hundred thouſande floreyns / all thynges conſydred
their other charges drewe to as moch / 
as they ſayde that had the receyte and delyueraunce
therof. The duke tooke counſayle
where this money ſhulde be reyſed / for ye duke
coulde nat breke nor mynyſſhe his eſtate / nor
it was nat his mynde to do. Than it was determyned
that the ryche men in all his good
townes ſhulde be tared / and ſpecyally they of
Flaunders / bycauſe they were ryche / by reaſon
of their marchaundyſe. This taracyon
was ſette forwarde / and whan they of Gaunt
were called curteſly to the mater / they aunſwered
and ſayd that they wolde gladly helpe to
ayde their en
                  •
               erytour with the ſōme of fyfty
thouſande florayns. In lykewyſe they of Bruges
and of other good townes in Flaunders
were redy to ayde their lorde. The duke and

ducheſſe thanked them curteſly / in lykewiſe
ſo dyde they of Arthoiſe and of Burgoyne.
Alſo the Frenche kynge ayded well for his
parte. And alſo it had coſt hym great riches
in ſendynge of preſentes and knightes in to
Hungry and Turkey / howbe it he was well
contente therwith / ſyth his coſyns and his
knyght Bouciquaunt were come to Venyce
in ſuretie.
            
               THerle of Neuers laye thus ſtyll
at Venyce / for his entēt was nat
to deꝑte thens / tyll euery thynge
was payed and diſcharge. For
the furnyſſhing of this fynaunce
ſir Dyne of Reſponde toke great payne / to
the entente to pleace the Frenche kynge and
the duke of Burgoyne. In ſuche buſyneſſe
he was ſubtyle and wyſe. Thus theſe Frenche
lordes and knyghtes ſported them eche
with other. The ſame ſeaſon there felle in

the moneth of Auguſte / and dured without

dyed moche people / and there dyed ſir Henry
of Barc eldeſt ſonne to the duke of Bare / 
and herytoure (by his wyfe) of all the lorde
of Coucyes landes / excepte the ladyes dowrye.
Thus in the ſame ſeaſon / bothe the ladies
of Coucy were widowes / and their huſbandes
deed / the whiche was great dōmage
His body was enbaulmed and caryed in to
Fraunce / and buryed in Parys as I beleue
and there his obſequy was done ſolempnely
To flye and eſchewe fro this deth at Venice
the erle of Neuers went and taryed at Trenuſe / 
with all his eſtate / and there taryed a
four monethes with all his company.
            THus the erle of Neuers beynge at
Trenuſe. It was ſhewed the kyng
of Hungry by them of the Roodes / 
howe the Frenche lordes were agreed with
Lamorabaquy to paye for their ſōmes two
hundred thouſande florens. Than the kyng
ſent letters by a byſſhoppe and certayne knightes
to them of Venice / in the fauour of the
Frenche knyghtes. And alſo they were charged
to ſaye certayne wordes to therle of Neuers / 
as ye ſhall here / for whan they cāe thider
they ſaid to hym. Sir / we are ſent hider
fro our ſouerayne lorde the kyng of Hungry

vnderſtādeth / howe ye are delyuered fro the
handes of the turkes his aduerſaries for certayne
raūſome / the whiche otherwyſe ye coude
nat haue ben deliuered wherof he is right
ioyouſe. And ſir / the kynge knoweth well yt
your treatie coude nat haue ben made without
great coſt and charge / for beſyde that ye
loſt in the batayle / your raunſome and other
charges hath ben and is dayly great. Wherfore
ſir / the kyng ſayth if he myght ayde you
with any thyng he wolde gladly do it / for he
thynketh him ſelfe bounde therto / as well by
lynage or otherwyſe. but ſir / he and his toke
ſuche dōmage at the daye of the batayle before
Nichopoly / as ye knowe well. And alſo
his reuenues of his realme for this yere and
ye next be in a maner as loſt. but whā he hath
recouery therof / and is of power (he ſaythe)
he wyll ſo purney for you / that ye ſhalbe wel
content with hym / & thus to do he is of good
wyll. And ſir / to thentent that ye ſhall gyue
credence to his promiſe and ſayeng. He hath
in the cytie of Venyce of yerely renenewes / 
ſeuyn thouſande ducates. And ſir / he is content
that this be ſolde to the venycience: and
that of the money that ſhall ryſe therof / that
ye ſhulde vſe it and ayde your ſelfe therwith
as ye wolde do of your owne goodes. And
ſir / of this we ſhall delyuer quitaūces to the
venicyence. we haue authorite ſo to do. this
offre greatly pleaſed the erle of Neuers and
his coūſayle / and the lorde of Rocheforde anſwered
and ſaid / howe the erle and all his cō
               pany
thanked greatly the kynge of Hungry
in that he wolde ſell or laye to gage his enherytaūce
for to ayde them. Sayeng howe his
o
                  ••
               re was nat to be refuſed nor forgotten / deſyring
to take a lytell counſayle in the mater
and ſo they dyde. Within a brefe tyme after / 
it was ſhewed to the kyng of Hūgeries ambaſſadours
in the behalfe of the erle of Neuers / 
that it ſhulde nat be cōuenyent that the
kyng of Hungry ſhulde ſell or ley to pledge
his enherytaunces / for other mennes cauſes.
But if ſo be the ambaſſadours wolde do ſo
moche as to ſhewe to the venicyēce that they
wolde do ſo moche as to lende therle of Neuers
a certayne ſōme of florence / to helpe to
paye the erles by charges / & to paye agayne
to the priour of ſaynt Iohn̄s in Acquitayne

the .xxx. thouſande florens / that he lent to thē
in the iſle of the Rodes. In thus doyng they
ſaide they wolde highly thanke the kynge of
Hungry & his counſayle. The ambaſſadors
ſaide they wolde do their beſt / and aſſaye the
venicyēce what they wolde do. Whan the venycience
were moued in this mater / they anſwered
but coldly / and ſaid they wolde take
counſayle and gyue anſwere within fyftene
dayes / at whiche tyme they anſwered (as I
was enformed / by one that was by at the anſwere
gyueng) that if the kyng of Hungry
wolde ſelle his hoole realme / the venycience
ſhulde be redy to bargayne with hym / & pay
hym in redy money. but they ſaid / as for ſo lytell
a thynge as ſcuyn thouſande ducates by
yere / they coulde make no price nor valewre
therof / nother to by nor to ſell / wherfore they
ſaid they wolde nat medell in that ſmall mater.
This was the anſwere that the venycience
made. Some thought and ymagined / 
that this anſwere was made by waye of diſſymulacion.
And that thoughe the kynge of
Hungry made this offre / yet by agrement / ye
venicyens made that anſwere. Thus the mater
abode ſtyll / and the kyng of Hungry ſtyll
in his poſſeſſyon of his reuenewes. Than̄e
the kynges ambaſſadours departed fro Venyce
and retourned in to Hungry / & the erle
of Neuers abode ſtyll at Trenuſe / bycauſe
of the mortalyte in Venyce.
            YE haue herde here before / howe the
lorde Philyppe of Arthois / erle of
Ewe and conſtable of Fraūce / dyed
in ye cite of Burſe in Turkey / of whoſe dethe
all his frendes were ſorie / and ſpecially the
frenche kyng / for he loued hym entierly. His
office was ſuche / that it myght nat longe be
vacant / whervpon all the lordes of Fraunce
aſſembled togider to take aduyſe who ſhuld
be made conſtable. The moſt parte of ye coū
               ſaile
agreed on the valyant knight ſir Loys
of Sanxere / who had ben long marſhall of
Fraūce / and was the ſame tyme. He was in
the parties of Languedoc / and ſo was ſente
for / and incōtynent he came to Paris / & ther
was made cōſtable. Than was voyde the office
of the marſhall. than ye kyng ſayd / none
ſhulde haue yt office / but alouely his knyght
ſir Bouciquaunt: euery man agreed therto / 
for he was well worthy. Whan he was choſen
he was at Venyce / but ſhortely after he
came to Paris. for the raūſoms ones payde
all the lordes and knightes of Fraūce returned
home. So ſir Bouciquaunt was Marſhall
of Fraunce. Therle of Neuers drewe
to the duke of Burgoyn his father and to the
duches his mother. he had great chere made
hym of them and of other / as it was reaſon / 
for he came fro a longe voyage and a peryllous.
He was well receyued ī all his fathers
countreis / as in Flaunders / in Arthoys / in
Burgoyne / and in all other places parteynyng
to his fathers and to his enherytaūce.

Cap. CC.xxv.
            
               THerle of Neuers thus
returned in to Fraūce / he
abode about the duke his
father / and viſyted his lā
               des
and ſignories. Than
he had deſyre to go to ſe ye
frēche kyng and the duke
of Orlyaūce / who receyued hym with great
ioye. The kyng and the duke of Orlyaunce
had great appetyte to here therle ſpeke / and
to here of ye newes of Turkey / and of all his
aduentures / and of the ſtate of Lamoraba
                  •
               .
therle anſwered wiſely & cōplayned nothing
of Lamorabaquy / but ſaid he had foūde hym
ryght curteſſe / & howe that he was well entreated.
and he forgat nat to ſhewe ye kyng &
the ladies / howe at his departyng Lamorabaquy
ſaid to hym / that he was borne in this
worlde to do dedes of armes / and to cōquere
euer more and more. And how that he wolde
nat cōmaūde thē whan they were priſoners / 
that they ſhulde no more beare armes agaiſt
hym / but ſaid he wolde rather haue thē come
agayne the ſeconde / thirde / or fourthe tyme / 
if nede were / if the dedes of armes ſo required.
And alſo he ſaid howe his entent was to
ſe Rome / and to make his horſe eate otes vppon
ſaynt Peters aulter. And alſo he ſayde / 

howe our criſten faythe was nothyng worth
but corrupted by the heedes that ought to gouerne
them / wherat the Turkes make but a
mocke. Wherfore he ſayd / it ſhulde be the diſtruction
of Chriſtendome / and that ye tyme
was as than come. And dyuers of the Turkes
and ſarazins ſayde / that their kyng Lamorabaquy
was borne to be lorde of all the
worlde. And this they of Turkey / of Tartarye / 
of Perce / of Alexandre / and of other
parties of the ſarazins landes ſayde. They
knewe it well that it ſhulde be ſo by reaſone
that the Chriſten men / were abuſed vpon .ii.
popes / wherby the chriſten men were nat all
of one accorde / but differedde. Some beleuyng
on the one pope / and ſome vpon the other / 
And the ſarazins had great marueyle / 
howe the heedes of Chriſtendome in euery
realme wolde ſuffre it. Theſe wordes of the
erle of Neuers made the Frenche kyng and
other lordes greatly to muſe. And ſome ſayd
howe the ſarazins had good reaſon to laugh
and mocke at chriſtendome / bycauſe they ſuffred
the prelates of the churche to medell ſo
moche. Therfore ſome ſayde / it was tyme to
abate their pompes / and to bringe thē to reaſon.
The clerkes of the vnyuerſite of Paris
who traueyled to lerne / coude nat come to any
preferment of any benifyce / by reaſon of
the Sciſme in the Churche / and of the two
popes / wherfore they wolde gladly that the
people ſhulde murmure agaynſt them. And
were ryght gladde that the erle of Neuers
ſayde / that the turkes made a great deriſion
therof. And ſayd. Howe that without the frē
               che
kynge and the kyng of Almaygne foūde
ſome remedy / euery thynge ſhulde be worſe
and worſe. And to ſaye the trouthe / ſuche as
helde them as neutre / they thought hadde taken
the beſt waye / and ſo euery man ought
to do / if they wolde bring the Churche in to
good caſe. Alſo it was ſecretly ſhewed the
Frenche kyng / by ſuche as he loued / and ſuche
as loued his helthe / howe that it was the
cōmen opinyon in the realme of Fraūce / that
he ſhulde neuer haue perfitely his helth / vnto
the tyme that the Churche were brought
in another eſtate. And alſo they ſhewed the
kynge / howe that kynge Charles his father
whan he laye in his dethe beed / charged his
counſayle in conſcyence / and had great dout
that he was ſore abuſed in thoſe two popes.
Than the Frēche kynge anſwered them and
ſayd. Whan the kyng my father dyed I was
but yonge / and I haue beleued hyder to / ſuche
as haue counſayled me / if there be folly / 
it is in them and nat in me. But ſythe we be
nowe this enformed in the matter / we ſhall
prouide for the remedy / and that ſhalbe well
ſene.
            THe Frenche kynge marked the mater
more profoundely than̄e euer he
dyde before / and ſayd to them of his
coūſayle / howe he wolde prouyde for the mater / 
and ſpake therof to his brother the duke
of Orlyaunce erle of Bloyes and of Valois
who agreed anone to the kynges wyll. In
lykewiſe ſo dyde the duke of Burgoyne / for
though he obeyed pope Clement / yet he had
neuer ferme beleue on hym. But the prelates
of the realme of Fraunce / and ſpecially Guy
of Roy archebyſſhoppe of Reyns / the archebyſſhoppes
of Sens and of Roen / and the
byſſhoppe of Oſtune / they had brought the
duke to beleue on pope Clement. Than̄e it
was aduyſed by the kynges ſecrete coūſayle
that if they purpoſed to bringe the Churche
to reſt and peace / to haue the accorde of Almayne.
Than was there ſente ſuffycient ambaſſadours
and clerkes of bothe lawes (as
maiſter Philyppe of Playes was one) in to
Almayne / to the kyng of Boeſme and of Almayne / 
who wrote hym ſelfe kyng of Romayns.
This mater went ſo forwarde / yt a day
was ſette that the kyng of Almayne and his
counſaile / and the Frēche kyng and his coū
               ſayle
ſhulde mete ꝑſonally at the cyte of Reynes.
This mater was done ſecretely / bicauſe
the prelates / cardynalles / archebyſſhoppes / 
and byſſhoppes / ſhulde nat breke their purpoſe
that they were about. They made it be
noyſed / that the metyng of theſe two kynges
and their counſayls at Reynes / was for non
other purpoſe / but to treate for a maryage to
be had bytwene the ſonne of the marques of
Blanquebourge / brother to the kyng of Almayne / 
and the doughter of the duke of Orlyaunce.
And ſo by reaſon and vnder colour
of that mater / they wolde common of other.
            In this ſame ſeaſone dyed at Neſues in
Heynaulte / the lorde Guye of Chaſtellone
erle of Bloyes / and brought to Valencēnes
and buryed at ſaynt Fraunces in the Freres

mynours / in a chapell called the Chapell of
Orthais. he had done moche coſte in the cloſynge
of the ſayd Freres / and whan he dyed
he was ſo in dette / that the counteſſe Mary
of Namure forſoke al his goodes / and durſt
nat take on her the admyniſtracyon of his teſtament / 
but retourned to her dowrie of the
lande of Chinay and of Beaumonde / & his
other herytages went to the heyres. The duke
of Orlyaunce hadde the countie of Blois
for he had payed whyle the erle Guye lyued / 
two hundred thouſande crownes of Fraūce
and the landes of Hollande / zelande / & Heynaulte /

Capi. CC.xxvi.
            
               YE haue herde here before / 
of the couert hates that was bytwene
kynge Rycharde of Englande / 
and his vncle Thomas
duke of Glouceſtre / whiche the
kynge wolde beare no lengar / but ſayd / and
alſo was counſayled / rather to diſtroye another
man than hymſelfe. And ye haue herde
howe the kyng was at Plaſſhey / & by crafte
and coloure / brought hym out of his owne
houſe to London / And by the waye about .x.
or a .xi. of the cloke in the nyght / therle marſhall
areſted hym in the kynges name. And
for all that he cryed after the Kynge / yet the
kynge made a deafe eare / and rode on before
and ſo the ſame nyght the kynge laye at the
towre of London / but the duke of Glouceceſtre
was otherwiſe lodged. For byforce he
was put in to a Barge / and out of the barge
in to a ſhyppe that laye in the Thamiſe / and
the erle marſhall with hym and all his company.
And dyde ſo moche / that the nexte day
by night they came to Calais / without knoledge
of any man / excepte the kynges offycers
of the ſayd towne.
            yE maye well knowe / whan̄e the takynge
of the duke was knowen at
Pla
                  •
               hey / by the ducheſſe and her
chyldren / they were ſore troubled and abaſſhed / 
and thought well that the matter went
nat well. The ducheſſe demaunded coūſaile
(what was beſt to do) of ſir Iohan Laquyham.
The knight anſwered / that it was beſt
to ſende to his bretherne / the dukes of Lancaſtre
and of yorke / that they myght fynde
ſome meanes to apeace the kynges dyſpleaſure.
For he ſayde / he thought that the kyng
wolde nat diſpleaſe them. The ducheſſe dyd
as the knyght counſayled her / and ſhe ſente
incontynent meſſangers to theſe two dukes / 
who were farre a ſondre / who whanne they
herde therof / were ſored diſpleaſed / and ſente
worde agayne to the ducheſſe that ſhe ſhuld
be of good cōforte. For they ſayd / they knew
well the kyng wolde nat entreat hym but by
laufull iudgement / for otherwiſe they coude
nat ſuffre it: but as thanne they knewe natte
where he was. The Ducheſſe and her chyldren
were ſomwhat conforted with their anſwere.
The kynge the nexte daye wente fro
the towre of London to Eltham / and there
taryed. The ſame night was brought to the
towre of London as priſoners / the erle of Arundell
and the Erle of Warwyke / wherof
they of the cytie of London had great marueyle / 
and made therof great murmurynge / 
but none durſt ſaye nay agaynſt the kynges

the duke of Lancaſtre and the duke of yorke / 
bretherne to the duke of Glouceſtre / They
maye prouyde for this whanne it pleaſe thē.
We thynke they wolde well haue prouyded
for the mater / if that they hadde knowen the

kynges entent agaynſt their brother of Gloceſtre / 
but bycauſe they were nat dilygent in
the cauſe / the matter is come yuell / and lyke
to haue an yuell concluſyon.
            
               WHan the duke of Gloceſtre was
brought to the caſtell of Calys / 
than he feared hym ſelfe greatlye / 
& ſaid to the erle Marſhall
For what cauſe am I brought
out of Englande hyder to Calais? Me thynke
ye holde me as a priſoner. Lette me go abrode
and ſe the fortreſſe aboute. Sir quod
the marſhall / that ye deſyre I dare nat do it / 
for I haue the charge vpon you on payne of
my lyfe. The kynge my ſoueraygne lorde is
a lytell myſcontente with you. Wherfore / ye
muſte take pacyence here for a ſeaſone / tyll I
here other newes / and that ſhalbe ſhortely
by goddes grace. For ſir / as helpe me God / 
I am right ſorie for your trouble if I myght
remedy it. But ſir / ye knowe well I am ſworne
to the kynge / wherfore I muſt obey / and
ſo wyll I do / for ſauynge of myne honoure.
The duke coude haue none other aunſwere / 
But by that he ſawe / he feared greatly his
lyfe. And on a daye he deſyred a preeſt that
ſange maſſe before hym / that he myght be cō
               feſſed.
And ſo he was at good leyſar before
the ſacrament / with deuout herte / and cryed
God mercy / and was ſore repentaunt of all
his ſynnes. And in dede it was tyme ſo for
hym ſo to do / for his dethe was nerer to hym
than he was ware of. For as I was enfourmed / 
whan he hadde dyned and was aboute
to haue waſſhen his handes / There came in
to the chambre foure men / and caſte ſodaynlye
a towell aboute the dukes necke / two at
the one ende and two at the other / and drewe
ſo ſore that he fell to the Erthe / and ſo they
ſtrangled hym / and cloſed his eyen. & whan
he was deed they diſpoyled hym / and bare
hym to his beed / and layde hym bytwene the
ſhetes all naked / and his heed on a ſofte pyllowe / 
and couered with clothes furred. And
than they yſſued out of the chambre in to the
hall / well determyned what they wolde ſaye
and ſayde openly / Howe a palueyſye hadde
taken the duke of Glouceſtre the ſame night
ſodaynly / and ſo dyed. Theſe wordes anon
were abrode in the towne of Calais. Some
beleued theym and ſome natte. Within two
dayes that the duke was thus deed / the erle
marſhall appareled hym ſelfe in blacke / bycauſe
he was his nere coſyn / and were many
other knyghtes and ſquyers that were in
Calays. His dethe was ſooner knowen in
Fraunce and in Flaunders than in Englād.
The Frenche men were gladde therof / For
there was a cōmon brute / that there ſhulde
be no good peace bytwene Fraunce and Englande / 
as long as he lyued. And in all treaties
bytwene Fraūce and Englande / he was
euermore harder and obſtynaier / than̄e any
other of his bretherne / wherfore they cared
nat for his dethe. In lykewiſe many men in
Englande / bothe knyghtes / ſquyers / and other
officers of the kynges / who were in feare
of hym / bycauſe of his crueltie. All ſuche
were gladde of his dethe. They toke to recorde
his cruell dedes / by ye duke of Irelāde
whom he had exyled out of Englande. Alſo
of ye deth of that valyant knight ſir Symon
Burle / and of ſir Robert Triuylien / ſir Nicholas
Bramble / ſir Iohan Standyſſhe / &
dyuers other. The dukes dethe was but lytell
regarded in Englande / excepte but with
ſuche as were of his opinyon. Thus this duke
dyed in Calais. his body was enbaumed
and ſeared in leed and couered / and ſo ſente
by See in to Englande. And the Shyppe
that caryed hym / arryued at the Caſtell of
Hadley / vpon Thamyſe ſyde / and fro thens
caryed by chariot ſymply to his owne place
at Plaſſhey / and there buryed in the Churche / 
Whiche the ſayde duke hadde founded
in the honoure of the hooly Trynite / wherin
were twelue Chanonnes to ſynge diuyne
ſeruyce.
            
               YE maye well knowe that the ducheſſe
of Glouceſtre and Affren
his ſonne / and his two ſuſters / 
were ſore diſcōfyted whan they
ſawe the duke brought thyther
deed. The ducheſſe had double ſorowe / for
Richarde erle of Arundell her vncle was be
heeded openly by the kynges cōmaundemēt
in Chepeſyde. there was no lorde durſt ſpeke
to the contrary / the kynge beyng preſente
at the ſame iuſtyce doynge. It was done by
the erle Marſhall / who hadde to wyfe the
doughter of the ſayde erle of Arundell / and

yet he bounde his eyen hym ſelfe. The erle of
Warwyke was in great daunger to be beheeded:
but the erle of Saliſbury who was in
the kynges fauour deſyred the kynge for his
lyfe / and ſo dyde dyuers other barons & prelates
in Englande. The kynge enclyned to
their requeſtes / ſo yt he myght be banyſſhed
and putte in ſuche a place as he ſhulde natte
come fro / for the kyng wolde nat clerely forgyue
hym. He ſayde he had well deſerued to
dye / bycauſe he was of counſayle with ye duke
of Glouceſtre and with the erle of Arundell / 
to haue brokē the peace and truce taken
bitwene Fraunce & Englande: For the whiche
artycle the kyng ſayd / they had deſerued
to dye / for the peace was taken bytwene the
ꝑties / on ſuche cōdycion yt who ſo euer dyde
breake it / ſhulde be worthy to dye. The erle
of Saliſbury / who had ben the erle of Warwykes
companyon dyuers tymes / in excuſyng
of him ſaid. Howe he was an olde man
and was deſyred by the duke of Glouceſtre / 
by his fayre wordes. Wherfore he ſayd / that
he dyde was natte of his owne mocyon / but
by theirs. Affyrming howe there was neuer
none of ye Beauchampes that euer dyd trayſon
agaynſt the crowne of Englande. Thus
the erle of Warwyke for pytie was reſpyted
fro dethe. He was banyſſhed in to the yſle of
Wyght: And it was ſayde to hym. Erle of
Warwyke / ye haue deſerued to dye as well
as the erle of Arundell / but for the great ſeruyce
that ye haue done in tyme paſt to kynge
Edwarde and to the prince his ſonne / and to
the crowne of Englande / aſwell on this ſyde
the ſee as byonde / hath done you great ayde / 
for the kyng hath pyte on you and hath graū
               ted
you your lyfe. But it is ordayned by iudgement / 
yt ye ſhall go in to the yſle of Wight
and lyue there as longe as ye can / and ſhall
haue ſuffycient of your owne to maynteyne
there your eſtate ſoberly / but ye maye neuer
departe thens. The erle toke this punyſſhement
a worthe / and thāked the kyng and his
counſayle for ſauyng of his lyfe / and ſo made
hym redy to go thyder at the daye apoynted.
In the whiche yſle was ſpace ſufficient
for a lorde to kepe his eſtate enuyroned with
the See. Thus paſſed forthe theſe Iudgementes
in Englande at that ſeaſon / whiche
multiplyed dayly worſe & worſe: as ye ſhall
here after.
            
               WHan the dethe of ye duke of glouceſtre
was knowē by the dukes
of Lancaſtre and of yorke / incō
               tinent
they knewe well that the
kynge their nephue had cauſed
hym to be ſlayne and murdered at Calays.
As than theſe two dukes were nat toguyder
eche of thē were at their owne plates. They
wrote eche to other to knowe what were beſt
to do / and ſo they came to London / For they
knewe well that the londoners were nat content
with the dethe of the duke their brother.
Whan they mette there toguyder / they tooke
coūſayle / and ſayd: Suche dedes ought nat
to be ſuffred / as to putte to dethe ſo hyghe a
prīce / as was their brother / for ydell wordes
and falſe reportes. For they ſayd / though he
ſpake oftentymes of the breakyng of ye peace
yet he neuer brake it: And bytwene ſayenge
and doyng is great difference / for by reaſon
of wordes / he ought nat to deſerue dethe by
ſuche cruell punycion. theſe two dukes were
in the caſe to haue put all Englande to great
trouble / and there were ynowe redy to counſayle
them therto / and ſpecially them of the
erle of Arundelles lynage and of the erle of
Staffordes / whiche was a great kynred in
Englande. The kyng as than was at Elthā
and had ſente for all ſuche as helde of hym in
chiefe. And he had redy aſſembled toguyder
about London / in Kent and Eſſexe / mo than
ten thouſande archers. And ſir Iohan Hollande
his brother was with hym / and therle
Marſhall and the erle of Saliſbury / and a
great nombre of lordes and knyghtes: & the
kyng ſent to thē of London / that they ſhulde
nat receyue the duke of Lancaſtre. They anſwered
and ſayd. They knewe no cauſe that
the duke hadde done / why they ſhulde refuce
hym. The duke of Lancaſtre was at Lōdon
and the erle of Derby his ſonne / and alſo the
duke of yorke and his ſonne Iohan / erle of
Rutlande. The kyng loued the erle of Rutlande
beyonde meaſure / who diſſymuled the
dethe of his vncle the duke of Glouceſtre / &
ſhewed howe he wolde gladly ſe a good peace
bytwene the parties / & ſaid howe he knew
well that his vncle dyde wronge oftentymes
agaynſt the kynge. The londoners in lykewyſe
conſydred the great myſchiefe yt myght
fall in Englande / by the diſcencyon bytwene
the kynges vncles & the kyng / and their alyaunces.

Alſo they conſydred / ſyth the myſchefe
was fallen of the duke of Glouceſtres dethe / 
that there was no recouery therin. they knewe
well it was bycauſe ye duke of Glouceſtre had
been to laueſſe of his tonge / and wolde haue
ſtyrred the realme to haue broken the trewce
bytwene Englande and Fraunce. Wherfore
ſuche as were wyſe men in the cytie diſſymuled
the mater / and thought it was no tyme to
a mende it as than / they feared the puyſſaūce
of Fraunce / and leſynge of their marchaundyſe.
Than beganne to treate and went as a
meane bytwene the king and the duke of Lancaſtre / 
who was in many imagynacions / for
the dethe of his brother troubled him ſore. Alſo
he ſawe howe his nephue kynge Rycharde
was alyed by mariage with the frenche kyng.
Alſo ye duke of Lancaſtre had .ii. of his doughters
out of the lande / one quene of Spayne / 
a nother quene of Portugale / by whome he
thought he ſhulde haue great ayde if he made
warre agaynſt his nephue kynge Rycharde.
All thynges conſydred the duke chaunged his
courage / at the deſyre of the londoners / and of
other prelates of Englande / who were meane
bytwene the kyng and hym / and by their meanes
the kynge was agreed with the duke / and
peace made. with that the kinge promyſed fro
thens forwarde to be gouerned by the duke of
Lancaſtre / and to do nothyng but by his counſayle
and aduyſe / whiche promeſſe the kynge
nothynge fulfylled / but was counſayled by
yonge and wylde coūſayle / whiche was to his
hurte and great dōmage / as ye ſhall here after
in this hyſtory.
            THus the kyng of Englande had peace
with his vncles / bycauſe of the dethe
of the duke of Glouceſtre. Than he beganne
to reygne more fierſly than he dyd before.
The kynge went and lay in Eſſex / where
as the duke of Glouceſtre had the chiefe rule / 
whiche ought to haue pertaygned to Affcen
his ſonne and heyre / but the kynge toke all / for
the ordynaunce in Englande was / the kynge
to haue ye warde of all herytours chyldren orphelyns
vnder the age of .xxi. yeres / and than
they to haue their herytages. Thus the kinge
tooke the wardeſhyppe of his coſyn / the duke
of Glouceſtres herytour / and the kynge toke
the poſſeſſion & profyte of all the dukes lande / 
and kepte the chylde with hym. And the ducheſſe
of Glouceſtre and her two doughters
were with the quene. The duke of Glouceſtr
                  •
               
by enherytaunce was conſtable of Englande
the kynge toke that offyce fro the right heyre / 
and gaue it to his coſyn the erle of Rutlande.
The kynge than kept greate ſtate than euer
he dyd: nor there had nat ben no kynge before
in Englande that ſpente ſo moche yerely by a
hundred thouſande nobles as he dyd. In lyke
wyſe the kynge had with hym the heyre of the
erle of Arundell / who was beheeded at London.
And bycauſe a knyght that was belongyng
to the duke of Glouceſtre called Cerbe / 
ſpake at a tyme certayne wordes agaynſt the
kynge and his counſayle / he was taken and
beheeded. Syr Iohan of Quynghay was in
great parell / but whan he ſawe that the maters
went ſo dyuerſely as they dyd / he dyſſymuled
as moch as he might / and departed fro
the ducheſſe of Glouceſtres houſe / and wente
and dwelt in other places. ¶In thoſe dayes
there was none ſo great in Englande / yt durſt
ſpeake agaynſt any thynge that the kyng dyd
or wolde do. He had counſayle mete for his appetyte / 
who exhorted hym to do what he lyſt.
The kynge kept ſtyll in his wages ten thouſande
archers night and day / that wayted on
him / for he reputed himſelfe nat parfytely ſure
of his vncles / nor of the lygnage of Arundell.

            ¶Of the great aſſemble that was
made in the cytie of Reyns / as well
by the emperour as of the realme of
Fraūce / on the ſtate of holy churche.
Cap. CC.xxvii.
            
               THe ſame ſeaſone there
was a great aſſēble of gret
lordes in the cytie of Reynes / 
what of lordes of the
empyre and of Fraunce / to
the entent to bring the churche
to a peace and reſte / for
the frenche kynge dyd ſo moche / that at his requeſt
his coſyn the kynge of Almayne came to
the cytie of Reynes with his counſayle / and
bycauſe they wolde nat haue it brewted that
they aſſembled there all onely for the mater by

twent the popes / the one at Rome and the other
at Auygnon / they made it to be noyſed
that they came thyder to treate for a maryage
of the ſonne of ye marques of Blācquebourge
with the doughter of the duke of Orlyaunce.
This Marques was brother to the kynge of
Almayne. The frenche kyng lay at the archebyſſhoppes
palayes and there was with hym
the dukes of Orlyaūce / Berrey / and Burbon / 
therle of ſaynt Powle and dyuers other hygh
barones and prelates of Fraunce. And whan
the kinge of Almayne entred in to the cytie / all
the lordes and prelates (and kynge Charles
of Nauer / who was in lykewyſe there) went
to mete with hym / and receyued hym honourably.
Fyrſte they brought hym to our lady
churche and after in to the abbey of ſaynt Remy / 
there the kynge of Almayne laye and his
lordes aboute hym. And it was ordeyned by
the frenche kinge / that what ſo euer the kynge
of Almayne ſpent ſhulde be at the frenche kynges
coſt. The almayns had euery day delyuered
theym ten tonne of herynge / for it was in
Lent tyme / and eyght hundred carpes beſyde
other fyſſhes / whiche was a great charge.
            WHan the kyng of Almayne came firſt
to the frenche kynge / all the lordes
went for hym to ſaynt Remy / and ſo
brought him to ye kynges palays. Whan theſe
two kynges mette they made great honoure
eche to other / and great reuerence / and ſpecyally
the frenche kynge / for almayns of nature
are rude and groſe manered / without it be to
take their profyte / therto they be experte and
redy ynough. All the lordes of Fraunce and
of Almayne toke acquayntaunce eche with other / 
with louyng wordes and countinaunce / 
and the frenche kynge made the kynge of Almayne
and his company a great dyner / at one
table there ſate / fyrſt the patryarke of Iheruſalem / 
than the king of Almayne & the frenche
kynge / and the kynge of Nauer / there ſate no
mo at that table. At the other tables ſate the
lordes and prelates of Almayne: No lorde of
Fraūce ſate that day / but ſarued. To the kynges
borde the meate was brought by the dukes
of Berrey & of Burbone / the erle of ſaynt
Powle / and by other great lordes of Fraūce.
The duke of Orlyaūce ſet euery man downe.
Veſſell of golde and ſyluer ranne plentuouſly
through the palays / as though it had ben but
of wode or erthe / it was a ſumptuous dyner.
And as I was enfourmed the frenche kynge
gaue to his coſyn the kyng of Almayne all the
veſſell and plate of gold and ſyluer / that was
ſerued that day in the palays at the dreſſer or
elſwhere / and all other hangynges and habylymentes
in the hall and chambre / whervnto
the kynge retrayed after dynner / and ſpyces
and wyne taken. This gyft was prayſed and
valewed to two hundred thouſande florayns / 
and more ouer there was gyuen to the other
almayns / great gyftes and goodly preſentes
of veſſell and plate of golde and ſyluer / wherof
the ſtraungers that were there had great
marueyle of the ſtate and puyſſaunce / & great
ryches of the realme of Fraūce. Theſe kinges
thus abydynge in the cytie of Reynes / their
counſayles mette togyther dyuers tymes on
the maters that they came thyder for / as well
for the maryage of the duke of Orlyaunces
doughter with the Marques of Blancque / 
bourges ſonne / as for the reformacyon of the
churche. At laſte the maryage was concluded
and openly publyſſhed through the cytie / but
as for the mater conſernynge the popes / there
was nothynge knowen therof out of the counſayle / 
for all that was concluded in the counſayle
was kept ſecrete. Afterwarde I was enfourmed / 
how it was agreed that maiſter Peter
Daylly byſſhop of Cambraye / ſhulde go
in legacyon fro the frenche kynge and fro the
kynge of Almayne to Rome / to hym that was
called pope Bonyface / that he ſhulde ſubmyt
hym ſelfe to haue a newe electyon of a pope / 
and in lykewyſe to ye other pope at Auygnon.
And if ſo be that any of them wolde nat agree
therto / to abyde the ordre of theſe two kynges
he to be dyſgrated & all ryghtes of the churche
to be kepte fro hym / and the frenche kynge to
compriſe to his agrement his ſonne in lawe
the kynge of Englande / and the kynge of ſcottes / 
kynge Henry of Spayne / kynge Iohan
of Portugale / kynge Charles of Nauer / and
the kyng of Aragon. and ye kinge of Almayne
ſhulde compryſe his brother Loys kynge of
Hungery / and all the realme of Boeſme and
Almayne to Pruce. And it was ordeyned that
whan this byſſhop of Cambrey was retourned
fro the ſōmonyng of theſe two popes / than
he to go in to all the ſayd realmes their alyes.
Thus theſe two kynges ſware to holde without
varyacyon or let. Thus ended their counſayle

at that tyme. The kynges and lordes departed
amyably / and euery man tooke leaue
and departed and went home.
            AT this counſayle at Reynes the duke
of Burgoyne was nat nor wolde nat
be
                  •
                for he ſayd before that it was but a payne / 
and a thynge loſte to gyue any thynge to the
almayns / for they kepe no promeſſe nor couenaūt / 
howe be it for all the dukes wordes there
was nothynge left / for the mater went forthe
as ye haue herde. And anon after the byſſhop
of Cambraye made hym redy / and tooke his
waye to Rome. Alſo the frenche kynge ſent a
great ambaſſade in to Englande to ſe ye kyng
and the quene / and to ſhewe them of this mater / 
and ſo they dyd. And whan they retourned
they ſhewed the frenche kynge howe the
kynge of Englande wolde take the ſame way
that the kynge of Almayne and the Frenche
kynge wolde do. So they were all concluded
if nede were to be as newter. Thus this mater
ſtode in this caſe. Kynge Charles of Nauer
who was in Fraūce to ſe the kynge his coſyn / 
truſtyng to recouer his herytage of Normandy
& of the countie of Ewrus / the whiche
the Frenche kynge had taken fro hym / as ye
haue herde here before / but he coulde nat attayne
therto by no meanes / what ſo euer he
ſhewed or ſayd. And whan the kynge of Nauerre
ſawe that he loſt his payne and labored
in vayne / he toke the mater in great dyſpleaſure / 
& toke his leaue as ſobrely as he coulde / 
nat well contente with the frenche kynge nor
with his counſayle / and ſo retourned in to the
realme of Nauerre. ¶Nowe lette vs leaue
ſpeakynge of them and ſpeke of other accydentes
that fell in Englande / wherby folowed ſo
great yuell / that the lyke hath nat ben written
of in this hyſtory / here foloweth the entre and

            ¶Howe the erle Marſhall in Englande
apealed by gage of vtteraūce
the erle of Derby / ſonne to the duke
of Lancaſtre / in the preſence of the
kynge and his counſayle.
Cap. CC.xxviii.
            
               KInge Richard of Englande
hadde a condycion
that if he loued a man / he
wolde make hym ſo great
and ſo nere him that it was
marueyle to conſydre / and
no man durſte ſpeke to the
contrary. and alſo he wolde lightly beleue / ſoner
than any other kynge of remembrance before
hym. and ſuche as were nere aboute hym
and in his grace / tooke no enſample of other
that had ben great with the kyng before them / 
as the duke of Irelande / who was put out of
Englande / and alſo ſyr Symon Burle who
by reaſon of ſuche counſayle as he gaue to the
kynge / he was beheeded / and ſyr Robert Treuylyan / 
& ſyr Nycholas Bramble and other
that had been of the kynges counſayle / wherfore
they ſuffred dethe / for the duke of Glouceſtre
dyd all his payne to dyſtroy them / and
yet fynally he loſte his lyfe / as ye haue herde.
wherof ſuche as were than aboute the kynge
was nothynge ſory / wherby ſome that were
aboute the kynge roſe in to ſuche pride that
it was marueyle / and in ſo moche that they
coulde nat coloure nor hyde it / and ſpecyally
the erle Marſhall / who was as great in the
kynges fauoure as myght be / and to the entente
to pleaſe the kynge and to flatter hym / 
he made the kynge beleue that he was a trewe
faythfull and a ſecrete ſeruaunt / and that he
coulde nat endure to here any worde ſpoken agaynſt
the kynge / and tolde the kynge many
thynges to haue the kynges loue / howe be it
often tymes a man thynketh to be auaunced / 
and is pulled backe / and ſo it fortuned of the
erle Marſhall / I ſhall ſhewe you howe.
            ye muſte knowe that the erle of Derby and
the duke of Glouceſtre deed / had to their wyues
two ſuſters / doughters to the erle of Herforde
and of Northamton / conſtable of Englande.
ſo the chyldren of the erle of Derby
and the duke of Glouceſtre were coſyn germayns
by their mother ſyde / and within a degre
as nere of kynne by their fathers ſyde. To
ſay trouth the dethe of the duke of Glouceſtre
was ryght dyſpleaſaunt to many great lordes
of Englande / and often tymes they wolde
ſpeke and murmure therat / whan they were
togyder / and the kynge than was ſo hygh vppon
the whele that no man durſte ſpeke / but

the kynge knewe it / for he had cauſed to be ſpoken
abrode in the realme that / what ſo euer he
were that ſpake any word of the duke of Glouceſtre
or of the erle of Arundell / he ſhulde be reputed
as a traytour / wherfore the people durſt
nat ſpeke. And on a day the erle of Derby and
the erle Marſhall communed togyder of dyuers
maters / at laſt amonge other they ſpake
of the ſtate of the kynge and of his counſayle / 
ſuche as he had about hym and beleued them / 
ſo that at the laſt the erle of Derby ſpake certayne
wordes whiche he thought for the beſt / 
wenynge that they ſhulde neuer haue ben called
to reherſall / whiche wordes were nouther
vylenous nor outragyous / for he ſayde thus.
Saint Mary fayre coſyn. what thynketh the
kynge oure coſyn to do? wyll he driue out of
Englande all the noble men / within a whyle
there ſhalbe none left? it ſemeth clerely that he
wylleth nat the augmentacyon of his realme.
The erle marſhall gaue none aunſwere / but
diſſimuled the mater / and toke it that he ſpake
agaynſt the kynge / and thought in hymſelfe
that the Erle of Derby was ryght lykely to
make great trouble in Englande / bycauſe he
was ſo great with the londoners / and the dyuell
was redy to ſtyre his brayne / and that
thynge that ſhall fall can nat be eſchewed.
            
               SO he thought to ſhewe this mater
to the kynge / whan noble mē
ſhulde be preſente / and on a day
to pleaſe the kynge / he ſayde.
Ryght dere ſyr / I am of youre
lygnage / and ame your lyege man and marſhall
of Englande / Wherfore ſir / I am bounde
to you by myne Alliegeaunce / and othe
ſworne my handes in yours / that I ſhulde be
in no place hearynge / any thynge contrarye
to your mageſte royall / and ſhulde kepe it ſecrete / 
I ought to be reputed as a falſe traytour / 
whiche I wyll nat be / for I wyll trewly
acquyte me agaynſt you / and all the worlde.
The kynge loked on hym / and demaunded
and ſayd. Why ſay you theſe wordes / we wyll
know it? My right redouted ſouerayne lorde
quod the erle Marſhall / I ſaye it bycauſe I
canne nat ſuffre any thynge that ſhulde be preiudyciall
or agaynſt your grace. ſyr cauſe the
erle of Derby to come before you / and than I
ſhall ſhewe you more. Than the erle of Derby
was ſente for / and the kynge cōmaunded
the erle Marſhall to ſtande vp / for he was on
his knee whyle he ſpake to the Kynge. And
whan the erle of Derby was before the kyng / 
who thought none yuell / than the erle Marſhall
ſayde. Syr erle of Derby / I ſay to you / 
ye haue thought yuell and ſpoken otherwyſe
than ye ought to do / agaynſte your naturall
lorde the kynge of Englande / whan ye ſayde
that he was nat worthy to holde lande or realme / 
ſeynge without lawe or iuſtyce / without
counſayle of any of his noble men / he diſtourbeth
his Realme / and without tytell or good
reaſon putteth out of his realme and dyſtroyeth
them / who ought to ayde and ſuſteyne him
wherfore here I caſt my gage and wyll proue
with my body agaynſt yours / that ye are an
yuell falſe traytour. The erle of Derby was
ſore abaſſhed with thoſe wordes / and ſtepte
backe a lytell and ſtode ſtyll a ſeaſon without
demaundynge of his Father or of any other
what aunſwere he ſhulde make. Whan he had
ſtudyed a lytell he ſtept forthe with his cappe
in his hande / and came before the kynge and
the erle Marſhall / and ſayd. Erle Marſhall / 
I ſaye thou arte an yuell and a falſe traytour / 
and yt I ſhall proue / my body agaynſt thyne / 
and in that quarell here is my gauge. Therle
Marſhall whan he herde howe he was apealed
ſhewed howe he deſyred the batayle. With
that the erle of Derby aunſwered and ſayde.
I ſette your wordes at the kynges pleaſure / 
and other lordes that be here / and I tourne
your wordes to a mocke and myne to be true.
Than eche of theſe erles drewe to their company
and lygnage / ſo that the manner of takynge
of wyne and ſpyces was lette paſſe / for
the kyng ſhewed hym ſelfe to be right ſore diſpleaſed / 
and ſo entred in to his chambre / and
left his two vncles without and all their chyldren / 
and the erles of Salyſbury and Huntyngdon
his bretherne. Than anone after the
kynge ſent for his vncles / and entred in to his
chambre. Thanne the kynge demaunded of
them what was beſt to do in this mater. Syr
quod they cauſe your conſtable to come before
you / and than we ſhall ſhewe you our opynyons.
Than the erle of Rutlande who was conſtable
was ſente for / and whan he was come / 
than he was commaunded to go to the erle of
Derby and to the erle Marſhall / and to take
ſuretye of theym / that they go nat out of the

realme of Englande without the kynges lycence.
The conſtable dyd as he was cōmaunded / 
and than retourned agayne to the kinges
chambre.
            
               YE maye well knowe this matter
greatly troubled the courte / and
many lordes and knyghtes were
ſore dyſpleaſed of that aduenture
and ſecretly they greatly blamed
the erle Marſhall / but he made as though he
had ſer nothyng by the mater / his hert was ſo
proude & preſumptuous. Thus the lordes departed
for yt day. The duke of Lācaſtre what
ſo euer coūtynaunce he made / he was ſore diſpleaſed
with theſe wordes / and he thought the
kynge ſhulde nat haue taken the mater as he
dyd / but ſhulde rather haue tourned it to nothynge / 
and ſo thought the moſte parte of all
the lordes of Englande. The erle of Derby
went and lay at London / and helde his eſtate
at his owne lodgynge / and there were pledges
for him / the duke of Lancaſtre his father / 
the duke of yorke / the Erle of Northumberlande / 
and dyuers other lordes. And the erle
Marſhall was ſente to the towre of London / 
and there helde his eſtate. Theſe two lordes
made prouyſyon / for that was neceſſary for
them for their batayle. The erle of Derby ſent
his meſſangers in to Lombardy to the duke
of Myllayne ſyr Galeas / for to haue armure
at his pleaſure. The duke agreed to the erles
deſyre / and cauſed the knight that the erle had
ſent thyder / whoſe name was Fraunces / to ſe
all the dukes armorye. And whan the knyght
had choſen ſuche as he lyked / than the duke furthermore
for loue of the erle of Derby / he ſent
four of ye beſt armorers that were in Lombardy
to the erle in to Englande with the knight / 
to the entent that they ſhulde arme and make
armure acordynge to the erles entente. The
erle Marſhall on his parte ſent in to Almayn
and in to other places to prouyde him for that
iourney. The charge of theſe two lordes was
greate / but the erle of Derby was at mooſt
charge. The erle Marſhall whan he beganne
that buſyneſſe / he thought to haue had more
ayde of the kynge than he had / for ſuche as
were nere aboute the kynge ſayd to him. Syr
ye haue nothyng to do to medle bytwene theſe
two lordes / dyſſymule you the mater / and let
them deale / they wyll do well ynough. Sir ye
knowe well the erle of Derby is well beloued
in the realme / and ſpecyally with the Londoners / 
and if they ſe that ye ſhulde take parte
with the erle Marſhall / ye were lyke to loſe
their loue therby for euer. The kynge vnderſtode
well their wordes / and knew well it was
trewe / he than diſſymuled the mater as moche
as he coulde / and ſuffred them to make their
prouyſyon where they lyſt.
            
               THe newes ſpredde abrode in dyuers
countreys of the defyaunce
bytwene the erle of Derby and
the erle Marſhall / Many men
ſpake therof in dyuers maners / 
and ſpecyally in Fraunce. They
ſayd lette theym alone / the knyghtes of Englande
are ouer proude / at length they wyll
dyſtroy eche other / for it is the worſte nacyon
in the worlde vnder the ſonne / for in yt realme
dwelleth the moſte preſumptuous people that
canne be. Other there were that ſpake more ſo
berly / and ſayde / that the kynge of Englande
ſhewed no wyſdome / nor was nat well counſayled / 
whanne for wylde wordes he to ſuffre
ſuche two noble men of his blode to enterpriſe
armes in defyaunce / he ſhulde rather whan he
herde the wordes fyrſte / haue ſayde to them
bothe. ye are two lordes of my blode and lygnage / 
wherfore I cōmaunde you bothe to be
in peace / and lette nouther hate nor rancoure
engendre bytwene you / but be frendes / louers
and coſyns togyther / and if this lande canne

ſymply (if he lyue longe) he wyll leſe his realme / 
and that hath been goten with moche
coſte and trauayle by our predeceſſours and
by vs: he ſuffreth to engendre in this realme
bytwene the noble men hate and dyſcorde / by

whom he ſhulde be ſerued and honoured / and
this lande kepte and douted. He hath cauſed
my brother to dye / whiche is one thynge to be
noted / and the erle of Arundell / bycauſe they
ſhewed hym trouthe / but he wolde nat here

agaynſt his appetyte. He canne nat better dyſtroye
his realme than to put trouble and hatred
bytwene the noble men and good townes
the frenche men are right ſubtyle / for one myſchiefe
that falleth amonge vs / they wolde it
were ten / for otherwyſe they canne nat recouer
their dōmages / nor come to their ententes / 
but by our owne meanes and dyſcorde bytwene
our ſelfe. And weſe dayly that all realmes
deuyded are dyſtroyed / it hath been ſene
by the realme of Fraunce / Spayne / Naples / 
and by landes of the churche / as we maye ſe

and I that am his father maye nat ſpeake to

               ALl the ſeaſone that theſe two lordes
dyd prouyde to do dedes of
armes at vtteraunce / the duke of
Lancaſtre came neuer at ye kyng
nor but lytell at his ſonne / and
that he dyd for a polycy / for the Duke knewe
well yt his ſonne was marueylouſly well beloued
in Englande / both with noble men and
with other / and ſpecyally with the londoners / 
for they had promyſed and ſayd to hym. Syr
be ye of good comforte in this buſyneſſe / for
howeſoeuer the matter tourne / ye ſhall ſcape
with honour / whether the kynge wyll or nat / 
or all the Marmoſettes aboute hym / for we
knowe well this mater is made and conueyed
by enuy / to the entente to driue you out of the
realme / bycauſe ye be well beloued with many
men. and if ſo be that ye departe in trouble
ye ſhall entre agayne with ioye / for ye ought
rather to rule than Rycharde of Burdeaulx / 
for they that wyll ſeke out the profoundeneſſe
of the mater / maye well knowe fro whence ye
came / and fro whence he came / wherby they
maye knowe yt ye be more nerer to the crowne
of Englande than Rycharde of Burdeaulx / 
though we haue made to hym faythe and homage / 
and haue helde hym for our kyng more
thanne this twenty yere / but that was by fauour
and purchaſe of his grauntfather good
kynge Edwarde / who douted of this poynte
that we nowe ſpeke of / and on a tyme great
queſtion was made bytwene kyng Edwarde
your grauntfather by youre father ſyde / and
duke Henry of Lancaſtre your grauntfather
by your mother ſyde / the Lady Blaunche of
Lancaſtre / but the lordes of Englande that
than reygned apeaſed the matter / for kynge
Edwarde was ſo valyaunt a man and ſo happy
in all his enterpriſes / that he had the loue
of all his people poore and riche / nor alſo your
grauntfather of Lancaſtre wolde nothynge
to the Kynge but well and good / and ſerued
the kynge in his tyme nobly and trewly / ſo
that he is as yet to be recommaunded. Theſe
maters well conſydred by kynge Rycharde / 
he myght well repente hym that he is no better
gouerned than he is. Suche wordes theſe
londoners ſpake / thoughe they knewe but lytell
of the trouth / that they ſpake was of a ſynguler
fauoure. The erle of Derby receyued
their wordes well a worthe / and dayly prepared
for the batayle / and he deſyred his frendes
to be at that iourney / and ſo euery man prepared
hymſelfe / accordynge to the Erles deſyre.
            
               THe kynge all the ſeaſon that theſe
two lordes prepared for their batayle / 
he had many ymagynacyons / 
whether he ſhuld ſuffre them
to fyght or nat. Thoughe he were kynge of
Englande / and more douted than any other
kynge before hym / yet nyght and daye he kept
about hym a garde of two thouſande archers / 

who were payed their wages wekely / for the

there is none ſo great in Englande / but if he

ouercome me. And I knowe for certaygne / 
that ſome of theym of my blode haue hadde

And ſir / ye ought rather to entertayne the generaltie

howe the erle Marſhall hathe greatlye treſpaſſed /

releaſe foure yere of the tenne / and ſo let

This is the counſayle ſir that we wyll

               ANone after that this

The kynge ſhewed howe he wolde be a

they were ſuche / that ought nat lyghtly to be

he hath brought this Realme in to this
trouble / by reaſon of his wordes / wherin he
canne nat make profe. That he ordayne him
ſelfe to auoide this realme of Englande / and
goo dwell in what place he lyſte out therof.
And that he be banyſſhed in ſuche wyſe / that
he neuer retourne agayne. And alſo I ordayne / 
that the erle of Derby our coſyn / bycauſe

excepte we repeale hym agayne / the

            THis ſentence greatly contented the
lordes that were there preſent / and
they ſayde / the erle of Derby maye
well ynoughe go and ſporte hym out of the
realme / for two or thre yeres. He is yonge ynoughe.
Thoughe he haue been ſore traueyled

in his dayes in farre countries / as in to

and to ſaynt Katheryns mount. So he may
do yet / goo ſome other voyages to paſſe the

He maye well paſſe the tyme with them. and
alſo as nowe there is no warre. Whan he cometh
in to Spaygne / he maye moue theym
to make warre vpon the Sarazyns / and to
make a voyage in to Granade / wherby he
maye better employe his tyme / than abydynge
in Englande / or elles he maye goo in to
Heynaulte to his brother and coſyn the Erle
of Oſtrenaunt / who wyll receyue hym with

he maye dayly here newes out of Englande

hym agayne by good meanes / whan it
ſhall pleaſe hym / for he is one of the fayreſt

Alſo there was the erle of Saliſbury / and

Theſe two lordes came to therle of Derby / 
I knowe nat if they diſſymuled or nat.

Sir / I thāke your grace / and whan it ſhall

lordes that were there / were well contented

man departed / and ſome went to London

To this requeſt the Frenche kynge and

               YE haue herde here before / 
howe yt kyng of Almaȳne and ye
kyng of Fraunce / & the lordes of
thempire and their coūſails had
ben at the cytie of Reynes / and
there they had dyuers ſecrete counſayls. and
their entencion was / to bring the churche in
to a parfyte vnite / for to folowe the way that
the churche helde as than. The errour was
to great. And alſo ye haue herde howe mayſter
Peter de Ailly byſſhoppe of Cambrey / 
was ſent in legacion to Rome to ſpeke with
pope Boniface. he ſpedde hym ſo in his iourney
that he came to Foūdes / and there foūde
pope Boniface / and to hym he delyuered his
letters of credence / dyrected fro the kynges
of Almaygne and of Fraunce. The pope receyued
them / and the byſſhoppe right mekelye.
The pope knewe well parte of his meſſage.
Than the byſſhoppe declared ye cauſe
of his cōmynge. Whan the pope hadde well
herde hym he ſayde / Howe the anſwere laye
nat all onely in hym / but alſo in all the cardy

nalles that had choſen hym pope. but he ſaid
whan he hadde ſpoken with them by delyberate
counſayle / than he wolde make ſuche anſwere
that he truſted to content them. This
aunſwere was ſuffycient for that tyme. The
byſſhoppe dyned that daye in the popes palyce / 
and certayne Cardynalles with hym.
Than after the pope departed fro Foundes
and went to Rome / and there the pope aſſembled
a conuocacion of the cardynalles in his
palyce beſyde ſaynt Peters churche. In this
conſiſtorie there were none but the pope and
his cardynalles / And there the pope ſhewed
the requeſt that the kynge of Almaygne and
the Frenche kyng had made hym by the byſſhoppe
of Cambrey / & there he demaunded
coūſaile what anſwere he ſhuld make. there
were than̄e many reaſons alleged / for it ſemed
right contrary to the cardinalles to put
downe that they hadde made / they ſayde it
ſhulde be greatly to their ſhame and rebuke
Than they ſaid to the pope. Holy father / to
cauſe theſe kynges to be in a good hope / yt ye
wyll obey to the / ye muſt ſōwhat diſſymule y•
mater / and ſaye howe ye wyll gladly obey to
all thynge that the kynge of Almaygne / the
kyng of Hungry / and the kyng of Englande
wyll counſayle you vnto. So that he that is
in Auignon / who writeth hym ſelfe pope Benedic / 
whom the Frenche kyng and the frenchmen
vpholde in his errour / that he depoſe
hym of the name of papalyte. And thā wher
ſo euer it ſhall pleaſe the ſayde kynges to apoynt
a cōclaue / ye wyll be redy and all your
bretherne the cardynalles. This counſayle
pleaſed well pope Boniface. This was the
ſpeciall and generall aunſwere that the byſſhoppe
of Cambrey had. And whan the Romayns
vnderſtode that ye kynges of Almaygne
and of Fraunce / had ſente to their pope
their ambaſſade / to haue him to leaue his papalyte / 
anone there multiplyed great murmuracion / 
through the cytie of Rome. And
the Romayns douted greatly to leſe the popes
ſiege / whiche was yerely to them a gret
profyte. For all pardons that ſhulde be two
yere after / the vantage therof ſhulde growe
to the cytie of Rome. and agaynſt that pardone
they had made great prouiſyon / wherfore
they douted leſt it ſhulde haue ben loſte / 
whiche ſhulde greatly haue ben to their preiudyce.
Than the mooſt notableſt perſones
in Rome aſſembled togyder / and came to the
Pope and ſhewed hym more ſigne of loue / 
than euer they hadde done before / and ſayd.
Holy father / ye are the trewe pope / therfore
leſe nat your herytage and patrimony of the
churche / the whiche was ſaynt Peters. take
neuer counſayle to the contrarye / but abyde
ſtyll as pope. For who ſoeuer be agaīſt you / 
we ſhall abyde with you / and ieoparde oure
bodyes and goodes / to defende you in youre
right. The pope aunſwered and ſayd. My
welbeloued chyldren be of good confort / and
be well aſſured / that I wyll abyde as pope / 
for any treatie of kynge or kynges to the contrary.
Thus the Romayns were contented
and apeaſed / and retourned to their houſes.
The popes anſwere was alwayes to the byſſhoppe
of Cambrey / that whā he parceyued
clerely that Benedic depoſed hymſelfe / than
he ſaid / he wolde be ordred by the ſayde kynges.
So the byſſhoppe retourned and came
in to Almaygne / and founde the kyng at Cō
               ualence / 
and there he ſhewed ye anſwere that
he had at Rome. Than the kyng of Almaygne
ſayde. Well. Shewe all this to our brother
and coſyn the Frenche kynge / and as he
ordreth hym ſelfe ſo ſhall I order me / and all
the empyre. But as farre as I can ſe / he muſt
begyn fyrſt. And whan he hath putte downe
his pope / than we ſhall putte downe ours.
Than the byſſhoppe departed fro the kyng / 
and rode tyll he cāe to Parys / wher he foūde
the Frenche kyng. And there the byſſhoppe
ſhewed his aunſwere whiche was kepte ſecrete / 
tyll the kyng had aſſembled toguyder
more nōbre of noble men and prelates of his
realme / by whome he wolde be counſayled / 
howe he ſhulde ꝑcede further.

               WHan the frenche kyng
had herde the aunſwere of
Pope Bonyface at Rome / 
and howe the kynge of Almayne
in lykewyſe aunſwered / 
how that firſt pope Benedyc
muſte be put dowue.
that done / than he wolde make a conuocacyon
of prelates and noble men of his realme / and
come to Parys. There were certayne prelates
in Fraunce / as the archebyſſhop of Reins
ſyr Guy of Roye / and the archebyſſoppes of
Rone and Sens / and the byſſhoppes of Parys / 
of Beauoys / and of Anxex / they had ſore
ſuſteyned the opynyons of pope Benedyc at
Auygnon / and ſpecyally of Clement / bycauſe
he was auaunced by their meanes. Theſe ſyxe
prelates were nat called to the kynge in this
counſayle / but other prelates and the vnyuerſyte
of Parys. And whan the byſſhop of Cambray
had ſhewed before them all / howe he had
ſpedde at Rome / and the aunſwere that pope
Bonyface and his cardynals had made hym / 
and the aunſwere of the kynge of Almayne / 
than they entred in to counſayle / and it was a
greed / yt the vnyuerſite ſhulde haue the greatteſt
voyce. Than it was determyned by the
vnyuerſite that the kyng ſhuld ſende ſyr Bouciquant
his marſhall in to the partyes of Auignon / 
and to do ſo moche by treatie or otherwyſe / 
that Benedic ſhulde leaue his papalyte
and to ordeyne hym ſelfe in all poyntes by the
kyng and his counſayle. and that the churche
in all the lymytacions in the realme of Fraū
               ce
ſhulde be as newter / tyll the churche were
brought in to parfyte vnyte / and that doone / 
than euery thynge to returne to the true right.
This counſayle was thought good and was
accepted of the kynge and all other. Than the
marſhall of Fraunce and the byſſhop of Cambray
were ordeyned to go to Auignon. They
departed fro Parys / and rode tyll they came
to Lyons on the ryuer of Roſne / and the
                  •
                they
two departed a ſōdre / for it was ordeyned that
the marſhall ſhulde tary ther ſtyll tyll he herd
tydynges fro the byſſhoppe / who rode forthe
and ſo came to Auygnon. There were ſome of
the cardynalles that knewe well wherfore he
came / but they diſſymuled the mater to knowe
what pope Benedic wolde ſay. whan the byſſhop
of Cambraye had refreſſhed hym at his
lodgynge / & had chaunged his apparell / than
he wente to the popes palayes / and whan he
came in the popes preſence he made his reuerence
but nat in ſuch wyſe as he ought to haue
doone / if he had taken hym as pope / as other
men dyd / and yet he made hym byſſhoppe of
Cambray / but that promocyon he had by the
meanes of the lordes of Fraunce. Than the
byſſhoppe of Cambray who was well langaged / 
bothe in laten and in frenche / ſpake and
ſhewed howe he was ſent thyder fro the french
kynge and fro the kynge of Almayne / and ſo
beganne his proces / and whan the byſſhoppe
came to the vtteraunce of the mater / howe the
pope ſhulde reſygne and depoſe hymſelfe fro
the papall dygnyte / and that he that was at
Rome ſhulde do likewyſe. With thoſe wordes
the pope beganne to chaunge colour / and lyfte
vp his voyce and ſayd. I haue endured great
payne & traueyle for the churche / and by good
election I was created pope / and nowe to depoſe
my ſelfe / that ſhall I neuer do during my
lyfe. and I wyll that the frenche kynge knowe
that for all his ordynaūce I wyll do nothynge
therafter / but I wyll kepe my name and papalyte
tyll I dye. Syr quod the byſſhoppe of
Cambray / ſauyng your grace / I toke you for
more prudent than I nowe fynde you. fyrſte
demaūde counſayle of your bretherne the cardynalles / 
and than make aunſwere / for you alone
can nat make no reſyſtence agaynſt them
if they agree to this opynyon / nor ye are nat able
to reſyſte the puyſſaunce of the kynges of
Fraunce and Almayne. Than two cardynalles
that were there ſuch as the pope had made
before / they parceyuynge the mater nat lykely
to do well / roſe and ſayd to the pope. Holy father / 
the byſſhoppe of Cambray ſpeketh well / 
ſyr we deſyre you do herin after his coūſayle.
Well quod the pope I am contente. So they
departed for that tyme / and the byſſhop went
to his lodgynge / and went nat to ſe any cardynals / 
but dyſſymuled hym ſelfe. The nexte
day be tymes the bell ſowned to the conſiſtory / 
and than there was a conuocacyon of all the
cardynalles that were at Iuygnon. They all
aſſembled at the palays / and entred in to the
conſiſtory / and thyder was called the byſſhop
of Cambraye / who in laten ſhewed at length
his meſſage / and the cauſe of his cōmyng thyder.
Whan he had ſayd than he was aunſwered / 
howe the pope ſhulde take counſayle to
anſwere / and in the meane tyme he to departe

out of the houſe / & ſo he dyd / and in the meane
ſeaſon Benedic and his cardynalles counſayled
togyder / and were longe debatynge of the
mater / and many thought it herde and a contrary
mater to put downe that they had created.
than the cardynall of Amyence ſpake and
ſayd. Lordes / whether we wyll or nat / it muſt
behoue vs to obey the Frenche kynge and the
kinge of Almayne / ſythe they be conioyned togyder / 
for without thē we can nat lyue / howe
be it we ſhulde do well ynough with the kyng
of Almayne if the frenche kynge wolde take
our parte / but it is otherwyſe / for he cōmaundeth
vs to obey / or els he wyll ſtoppe fro vs the
fruites of our benefyces / without the whiche
we can nat lyue. Trewe it is holy / father that
we haue created you as pope / on ye condycion
that to your power ye ſhuld ayde to refourme
the churche / and to bring it in to parfyte vnyon / 
and this ye haue alwayes ſayd and mayntayned / 
therfore ſyr aunſwere atemperately / 
and in ſuche maner as we may prayſe you / for
ſyr ye ought better to know your owne corage
than we. Than dyuers other of the cardynalles
ſayd / ſyr the cardynall of Amyence ſayeth
well and wyſely / wherfore ſyr we pray you all
in generall / that ye wyll ſpeke / and ſhewe vs
what ye wyll do. Than Benedyc aunſwered
and ſaid. The vnyon of the churche I deſyre / 
and I haue taken great payne therin / but ſyth
god of his deuyue grace hathe prouyded for
me the papalyte / and that ye haue choſen me
therto / as longe as I lyue I wyll be pope / and
I wyll nat depoſe my ſelfe nouther for kyng / 
duke / erle / nor other treatie / nor by no proceſſe
nor meanes / but yt I wyll abyde pope. Than
the cardynals roſe vp all togyder with great
murmurynge / ſome ſayd he had ſpoken well / 
and ſome ſayd contrary. Thus they dyffered
and were in dyſcorde. The moſt parte departed
out of the conſyſtory / and toke no leaue of
the pope / and retourned to their lodgynges.
Some ſuche as were in this popes fauour taryed
ſtyll with hym. Whan the byſſhoppe of
Cambray ſawe howe they departed in ſuche
maner / he knewe well they acorded nat well / 
and therwith auaunced hym ſelfe / and entred
in to the conſyſtory / and ſo came to the Pope
whyle he ſate ſtyll in his ſee / and without doynge
of any great reuerence ſayde. Syr gyue
me myne aunſwere / ſythe ye haue had your
counſayle aboute you / ye ought to gyue me
myne aunſwere that I may retourne. This
pope Benedic who was in great dyſpleaſure
for the wordes that the cardynall of Amyence
had ſpoken / ſayd. Byſſhoppe of Cambray I
haue counſayle of dyuers of my bretherne the
cardynals / who hath created me in to the dignyte
papall / and haue receyued all the ſolemynytyes
therto belongyng / and am writen and
named pope by all my ſubgiettes / and as pope
I wyll abyde as longe as I lyue / I wyll nat
do the contrary to dye in the payne / for I haue
doone no cauſe why to leſe it / and ſaye to our
ſonne of Fraunce / that hyther vnto I haue taken
him as a good catholyke prince / but nowe
byſyniſter meanes if he wyll entre in to great
errour / he wyll repente it. I praye you to ſay
to hym fro me / that he be well aduyſed howe
he enclyneth to any thinge that ſhulde trouble
his conſcyence. Therwith this Benedic roſe
out of his chayre / and went in to his chambre / 
and certayne cardynalles with hym / and the
byſſhoppe of Cambray retourned to his lodgynge / 
and dyned ſobrely / and than after toke
his horſe and paſſed the bridge of Rone / and
came to vile Nefe / and at nyght lay at Baignoulx / 
whiche partaygned to the Realme of
Fraunce / and he vnderſtode that ſyr Boucyquant
marſhall of Fraunce was come to porte
ſaynt Andrewe a nyne leages fro Auygnon.
The nexte day thyder came the byſſhoppe of
Cambray / and ſhewed hym the aunſwere of
Benedic. Whan the marſhall vnderſtode that
this pope Benedic wolde nat obey the kynge
his mayſters ordynaunce / he ſayd to the byſſhop.
ſyr ye are beſt to retourne in to Fraunce / 
ye haue no more to do here / and I ſhall execute
that I am cōmaunded to do by the kynge
and his vncles. The next daye the byſſhoppe
departed and toke the way to Albenoys and
to Pyne / and the marſhall ſet clerkes awarke
to write / and ſente for knyghtes / ſquyers and
men of warre through all the countrey of Viurays / 
of Vyuieres / and Auuergne to Mount
pellyer / for he had cōmyſſyon ſo to do by the
king / and alſo he ſent to the ſeneſchall of Beaucayre / 
that he ſhulde cloſe all the paſſages as
well by the ryuer of Rone as by lande / to the
entent that nothynge ſhulde entre in to Auignon.
He wente hym ſelfe to the pownte ſaynt
Eſperyte / and cloſed there the paſſage ouer
the ryuer of Rone / that nothynge ſhulde entre
that way in to Auygnon. Thus the marſhall

daily gathered men of warre / and many came
to ſerue hym / ſome for obeyſaunce / and ſome
to pyll and robbe theym of Auygnon. There
came to hym ſyr Raymonde of Thourayne / 
and the lorde de la Both / the lorde of Tornon / 
the lorde of Monclaue / and the lorde Duſes / 
ſo yt the marſhall had a great nombre of men.
Than the marſhall ſent an haraulde to defye
pope Benedic in his palays / and all the cardynals
that wolde take his parte. This was
harde tydynges to the cardynals / and to them
in the cytie of Auygnon / for they knewe well
they coulde nat longe ſuſteyne the warre agaynſt
the puyſſaunce of the Frenche kynge / 
than they determyned to go and ſpeake with
the pope / and ſo they dyd / and ſhewed hym
howe they coulde nat nor wolde nat ſuſteyne
the warre agaynſt the frenche kynge / for they
ſayd they muſt lyue and haue their marchaundyſe
to go as well by lande as by ryuer. This
Benedyc aunſwered folyſſhly and ſayd: ſyrs
your cytie is ſtronge and well prouyded / I
wyll ſende for men of warre to Gennes and in
to other places / and to my ſonne the kynge of
Aragon / that he come and ſerue me / whiche I
am ſure he wyll do / for he is bounde therto for
two cauſes / he is of my lygnage / and alſo he
ought to be obeyſant to the pope. Sirs / ye are
abaſſhed of to lytell a cauſe / go your wayes
and kepe and defende your towne / and I ſhall
kepe my palays. Other aunſwere the cardynals
and the men of the cytie coulde nat haue
of this Benedyc. So euery man retourned
home. This Benedic had of longe tyme purueyed
his palays with wyne / corne / larde / oyle
and of all other thinges parteynynge to a fortreſſe:
and alſo he was of his perſon hygh and
cruell / and wolde nat be abaſſhed for a lytell
thynge. The marſhall of Fraunce departed
fro pount ſaynt Spyrite / and paſſed with all
his company by the towne of Orenge / by conſent
of the prince of Orenge / and ſo entred in
to the countre of Venyce / whiche was lande
parteygnynge to the churche / the whiche anone
was ouer rynne / and the men of warre
paſſed at ye bridge of Sourgnes / and ſo they
were lordes of all the ryuer / and the marſhall
taryed in the towne of Sourgnes with a gret
nombre of menne of warre to kepe the towne
and paſſage / and alſo the garyſone of Noues
whiche partayned to the pope. Than the marſhall
went and lodged at ſaynt Verayne nere
to Auignon / and his men therabout / and dayly
came thyder men of warre / ſo that the cytie
of Auignon was cloſed in before and behinde
by lande and by the ryuer / ſo that nothynge
coulde entre nor iſſue without leaue. for at the
towne of Noue without Auygnon / whiche
partayned to the realme of Fraunce / was the
ſeneſchall of Beaucayre with fyue hundred
men / and kepte the entre on that ſyde / and the
marſhall of Fraūce with two thouſande men
was on the other ſyde of Auignon / and he ſent
to theym of the cytie that without they wolde
obey and open their cytie / that he wolde burne
all their vynes and houſes abrode in the countrey
aboute to the ryuer of Dureuſe. That ſō
               monynge
greatly abaſſhed the men and women
within the cytie / for their herytages laye
without Auignon vnto the ryuer of Dureuſe.
Than they went to counſayle without knowledge
of the pope / and they called to their counſayle
certayne cardynals / as the cardynall of
Amyence / of Poictours / of Newcaſtell / of Viuyers / 
and dyuers other. Than ſuche as had
moſte to loſe ſhewed theſe cardynalles howe
the marſhall of Fraunce had thretened them
to brinne their vynes and their howſes / and
all this had cauſed the frenche kynge / agaynſt
whome they coulde nat reſyſte / for his puyſſaunce
was ſo nere them. and all thynges conſydred / 
they ſayde they were better to obey to
the frenche kynge / than to holde their paryllous
opynyons / for of Benedyc they coulde
haue no ayde nor comforte / and they demaunded
of theſe cardynalles if they wolde ioyne
and take their parte. The cardynals ſaid they
were content to take their wayes / for vitayles
beganne to fayle theym / and alſo their benefyces
were in the realme of Fraunce / whiche
they ſayd they wolde nat wyllyngly leſe. So
they entred in to treatie with the marſhall of
Fraunce / the whiche toke ſuche effecte / that all
the men of warre entred in to the cytie of Auignon / 
and it was apoynted to beſiege the palays / 
their couynaunt was to do no hurte nor
dyſpleaſure to the cardynalles nor to none of
their men / nor to the hole body of the towne.
This to do the marſhall promyſed. So they
entred in to Auignon / and lodged at their eaſe
and lybertie / and than all the paſſages as well
by lande as by water were opened / to the entent
that all maner of bytayle myght come to
the cytie.
            
               
WHen he that wrote him ſelfe pope Benedyc / 
beynge cloſed in his palays)
ſawe that the cardynals and the men
of the cytie had made a treatie with the marſhall
of Fraunce without his counſayle or aduyſe / 
he was therwith ſore dyſpleaſed / howe
be it he ſayd that he wolde nat ſubmytte hym
ſelfe / to dye in the payne / and ſo he kepte hym
ſelfe cloſe in his palais / which was as ſtronge
a place as any in the worlde / and moſt eaſyeſt
to be kepte / ſo that it be well vytayled. This
pope had ſent letters to the kynge of Aragone
inſtantly to ſocoure hym in his nede / and to
ſende him men of warre that he myght be able
to reſyſt the marſhall of Fraunce alſo he ſente
the kynge worde in his letter / that if he coulde
get hym thens fro Auignon / he wolde go and
kepe his ſee apoſtolyke in Aragon / at Parpygnon
or at Barcelone. The kynge of Aragon
ſawe well the popes letters / but he made
no force of them / and ſayd to his coūſayle that
were aboute hym. What / weneth this preeſt
that to ſuſteyne hym and his argumentes / I
ſhall enterpryſe to make warre agaynſte the
frenche kyng to ayde hym / than I might well
be reputed a fole? Syr quod his counſayle ye
ſay trouthe / ye haue no nede to medle in that
mater / for ſyr ye may be ſure the frenche kynge
hath ſuche counſayle aboute hym / yt he wolde
make no warre agaynſt hym without a iuſte
cauſe / lette the clergy alone / for if they purpoſe
to lyue the prelates muſt obey the great lordes

                  〈◊〉
                whome their rentes and reuenues are / 
they haue longe kept them in peace. And alſo
ſyr
                  •
               he frenche kynge hath writen to you all redy / 
deſyringe you to determyne you and your
countrey to be newter / as he is and wyll be / 
and ſyr ye were beſte ſo to do / for my lady the
quene who is the Frenche kynges coſyn germayne / 
is content ſo to be / and ſo is the moſte
parte of your realme / and the clergy in lykewyſe / 
and ſpecyally Catelone and Spayne / 
and ſyr we thynke it is the beſt opynion / for if
all criſten kynges do nat the ſame the churche
ſhall neuer come to vnyte by reaſone of two
popes. Thus the kynge of Aragon and his
counſayle deuyſed togyder / and pope Benedic
was ſtyll in his palays / truſtynge to haue
ayde of the kynge of Aragon / but he was dyſceyued / 
and the marſhall of Fraūce was with
in the cytie of Auygnon / and the palays was
ſo kept that none coulde iſſue out nor entre in.
They lyued with that ſtore they had / for of vytayles
they had ſuffycient for two or thre yere / 
but they lacked woode to make fyre with all / 
and to ſethe their meate / whiche made theym
abaſſhed. Euery weke the marſhall herde newes
fro the frenche kynge and the kynge fro
hym / and the kynge cōmaunded hym that he
ſhulde nat departe thens tyll he had atchyued
his enterpriſe. Thus the pope coude nat iſſue
out of ye palays / there was ſuche watche layde
on hym.
            THe concluſyon was / whan this Benedyc
ſawe that he was ſo ſtraytely
kepte / and that fyre fayled hym / and
other prouyſions dayly dyſcreaſed / and ſawe
that no comforte nor ayde came to hym fro no
parte / at laſte he yelded / at the requeſt of certayne
of the cardynalles / and the treatie was
thus / yt he ſhulde nat departe out of Auignon
tyll there were made an vnyon in the churche / 
and a certayne garde was ſette aboute hym / 
and the cardynalles and ryche men of Auignon
bounde them ſelfe to kepe this Benedyc
ſo ſtrayte / that they ſhulde rendre accompte of
hym agayne / outher quycke or dede. Suche
cardynals as had their benefyces in Fraunce
tooke great payne to make this treatie and
compoſycion / for they ſayde all with one accorde / 
that they wolde abyde with the frenche
kynge. Thus this buſyneſſe ended at yt tyme / 
and euery man departed / and the Marſhall
went to Parys / and anone after he ordeyned
him to go in to the realme of Hungery / for the
kynge of Hungery had written to the frenche
kynge howe Lamorabaquy aſſembled great
puyſſaunce of men of warre / of turkes / arabyes / 
tartaryes / and ſuryens / and of dyuers
other of his ſecte / to fyght with hym. The erle
of Derby the ſame ſeaſon beynge at Paris in
the houſe of Clyſſone / nere to the temple / was
wyllynge to go in to Hungery / whiche ſhulde
be the leſſe coſte to the Frenche kynge / for he
had euery weke redy payed him fyue hundred
crownes of golde / and the erle thought hym
ſelfe moche bounde to the frenche kynge for
that grace / and whan that tydynges came fro
the kynge of Hungery in to Fraunce / the erle
of Derby entended well to that mater / and
thought in hym ſelfe that voyage to be ryght
honourable for hym to paſſe his tyme there / 
wherby he ſhulde the lightlyer forget the tyme

of his trouble / and ſpake to them of his ſpecyall
counſayle / and they counſayled hym to go
in that voyage / ſo that he knewe fyrſt the duke
of Lancaſtre (his fathers) pleaſure in that behalfe.
Than the erle one of his knyghtes
called Dinorth in to Englande / to knowe his
fathers pleaſure. This knyght came in to Englande / 
and founde the duke of Lancaſtre at
a Caſtell a twenty myle fro London / called
Hertforde. There he ſhewed hym his ſonnes
entente. And whan the duke vnderſtode the
mynde of the erle his ſonne / and the good wyll
that he had to go in to Hungery / to paſſe the
tyme of his banyſſment / he was ryght well
content / and ſayd to the knyght. ſyr / ye be welcome / 
your wordes and my ſonnes lettre requyreth
counſayle
                  •
                ye ſhall reſt you here with
vs a ſeaſon / and in the meane whyle we ſhall
take aduyſe / and in the whyle ye may go and
ſe my ſonnes chyldren / for ye muſte beare tydynges
of them to their father. Syr quod the
knyght ye ſay true. So this knyght ſyr Dynorth
taryed a ſeaſon in Englande.
            NOwe had the frenche kinge good occaſyon
to write to the kynge of Almayne
and to his coūſayle in / what
caſe he had brought pope Benedic and the cardynalles.
The kynge than ſent thyder a noble
ambaſſade / as the patryarke of Iheruſalem. /
ſyr Charles of Hangers / and other knightes / 
and they founde the kynge at Strawbourgh
and dyd their meſſage / wherwith the kynge
and his counſayle were well content / and ſayd
howe they wolde determyne on that matter / 
but they ſaid / they wolde gladly that the kyng
of Englande ſhulde take the ſame waye / the
whiche they feared ſhulde be herde to do. with
this aunſwere the ambaſſadours retourned
in to Fraunce / and ſhewed the kynge what
they had doone and ſene. The frenche kynge
than to thentent to bring his purpoſe to paſſe / 
ſente agayne in to Englande to kynge Rycharde / 
and the meſſangers ſhewed the kynge
the cauſe of their cōmynge. The kynge gaue
good herynge to the mater / but as than he had
nat the prelates of the realme nor the clergy
with hym / nor were nat ſo plyable to folowe
his pleaſure / as they in Fraunce to folowe the
pleaſure of their kynge / and this he ſhewed to
the frenche kynges meſſangers / howe be it he
ſayde he wolde do his deuoyre / and ſo he dyd.
And ſo the meſſangers returned in to Fraūce
and kynge Rycharde on a daye at Weſtmynſter
aſſembled all his prelates and clergy of
Englande / and whan they were there ye kynge
ſhewed wyſely the dyfference that was in the
churche / and howe the frenche kynge by delyberacyon
and aduyſe of counſayle / and by conſent
of the vnyuerſite of Parys and other clerkes / 
he was determyned to be newter / and in
lykewyſe ſo are the kynges of Spaygne / of
Scotlande / of Aragone / and of Nauer / and
howe that all Almayne / Boeſme / and Italy / 
were of the ſame opynyon. In lykewyſe the
kynge of Englande / deſyred that his realme
ſhuld folowe the ſame. Whan the prelates and
the clergy / who knewe nothynge why they
were ſent for / herde that mater they had great
marueyle / and were ſore abaſſhed / ſome ſtode
ſtyll and ſpake no worde / and ſome began to
murmure and ſayde. Our kynge is become
frenche / he entendeth to nothynge / but to dyſhonour
and diſtroy vs / but he ſhal nat. What / 
wolde he bringe vs out of our beleue / he maye
do ſo moche that he ſhall haue yuell therof / let
vs nat folowe this opynion / ſythe the frenche
kynge taketh that waye / lette hym holde hym
ſelfe newter / and let vs holde ſtyll our beleue / 
and lette no man put it fro vs / without there
be greater apparaunce of a ſurer foundacyon / 
than we ſe as yet. Whan kyng Rycharde ſawe
the dyfference and murmurynge of the clergy / 
he cauſed the byſſhoppe of London to demaunde
of all the clergy what was beſt to do.
They all aunſwered that the matter was ſo
great / that therin requyred great counſayle
and delyberacyon / and ſo they departed / and
euery man went to his lodgynge. And whan
the londoners knewe the cauſe of that aſſemble / 
and the requeſt that the kynge had made / 
they were than ſore troubled agaynſt ye kyng / 
for the people of Englande were ſo fermely ſet
on the beleuynge on the pope at Rome / that
they wolde nat leaue it / and ſayde howe that
Rycharde of Burdeaulx wolde diſtroy them
all if he be let alone / his herte is ſo frenche that
he canne nat hyde it / but a daye wyll come to
paye for all / that he ſhall repente hym and all
ſuche as gyue hym ſuche counſayle. What ſo
euer the kynge ſayd to haue his people newter / 
they wolde in no wyſe agree therto. And
the frenche kynge was nat well content with
his ſonne kynge Rycharde / in that he had nat

incontynent cauſed his realme to haue been
newter / but to ſaye the trouth / the kynge was
nat to blame therin. And alſo ſuche accydentes
fell ſoone after / the whiche were ſo great
and horryble that the lyke hath nat ben ſene in
all this hyſtorye vpon no kynge cryſten / except
of noble kynge Peter of Luſygnen / kyng
of Cyper and Iheruſalem / whome his owne
brother and the cypriens martyred.

            ¶Of the aunſwere of the / Duke of
Lancaſtre to the knyght ſent to hym
fro his ſonne the erle of Derby / and
howe the duke of Lancaſtre dyed.
Cap. CC .xxxiiii.
            
               WHan ſir Dinorth Whom
the erle of Derby had ſente
in to Englande to his father
the duke of Lancaſtre
and had his anſwere of the
duke / and had vyſyted all
the erles landes / and had
ſene his chyldren four ſonnes and two doughters / 
than he toke his leaue and retourne in to
Fraunce. His aunſwere was / howe that the
duke wolde nat counſayle the erle his ſonne to
go in to Hungery / but whan he was wery of
beynge in Fraūce / than rather to go in to Caſtell
to the kynge there / and to his ſuſter / and
if he lyſte to go further / than to go and vyſite
his other ſuſter the quene of Portugale. The
erle redde his fathers letters two tymes ouer / 
and ſtudyed theron a ſeaſon. and ſyr Dinorth
ſhewed him that the phyſicions and ſurgyons
in Englande ſayd ſurely / howe that the duke
his father had on hym a paryllous ſyckneſſe / 
whiche ſhuld be his dethe. theſe wordes gretly
letted the erle to take on hym any maner of
voyage / but ſo taryed ſtyll at Parys / and often
tymes he went and ſawe the frenche kyng / 
the duke of Orlyaunce / and the kynges vncles / 
and alwayes they made hym good chere
ſo that he was moche bounde to them / and he
ſayde to the kynge. Syr / ye do me ſo moche
honoure and curteſy / and ſhewe me ſo great
ſygne of loue / that I knowe nat in all my lyfe
dayes howe to deſerue it / but if euer I come
in Englande my lady yt quene your doughter
to my power ſhall haue my ſeruyce. I thanke
you coſyn quod the kynge. So it fell that aboute
the feeſt of Cryſtmaſſe / duke Iohan of
Lancaſtre / who lyued in great dyſpleaſure / 
what bycauſe the Kynge had banyſſhed his
ſonne out of the realme for ſo litell a cauſe / and
alſo bycauſe of the yuell gouernynge of the realme / 
by his nephewe kynge Rycharde / for he
ſawe well that if he longe percepuered & were
ſuffred to contynewe / the realme was lykely
to be vtterly loſte. With theſe ymagynacyons
and other / the duke fell ſycke wheron he dyed / 
whoſe dethe was greatly ſorowed of all his
frendes and louers. The kyng by that he ſhewed
toke no great care for his dethe / but ſone
he was forgotten. Than certayne of the noble
men of Englande ſawe well howe the realme
feblyſſhed / ſythe the duke of Lancaſtre was
deed / and the duke of Glouceſtre his brother
ſlayne / and the erle of Arundell. and the erle of
Derby banyſſhed / who ought than to be duke
of Lancaſtre by ryght ſucceſſion. Than ſome
ſayde. Nowe we ſhall ſe what the kynge wyll
do / it is tyme nowe yt he repeale home agayne
his coſyn of Derby / and to pardone hym his
yuell wyll / though he haue no cauſe to be dyſpleaſed
with hym / it were tyme he came and
entred in to his landes as duke of Lancaſtre.
Suche wordes ranne a brode in the Realme
in dyuers places / and ſpecyally in the cytie of
London / where the erle of Derby was a hundred
tymes better beloued thanne the kynge / 
howe be it for all the wordes and murmuryng
that the kyng and his counſayle knewe of / yet
he dyd nothynge therafter / but clene the contrary.
He was yuell counſayled / for if he had
incontynent after the dethe of the duke of Lancaſtre
ſente for the erle of Derby / and at his
cōmynge haue frendely welcomed hym home
and haue called hym duke of Lancaſtre / and
haue taken hym as greateſt perſonage in Englande
nexte hym ſelfe / and haue ſayde howe
he wolde be gouerned in all poyntes after his
aduyſe and counſayle / and to do nothynge
without his aduyſe / than the kynge had done
well / and lykely to haue contynued his eſtate
as kynge of Englande / and had nat receyued
the yuell fortune that fell to hym ſhortly after / 
as ye ſhall here after.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe the dethe of the duke of Lā
               caſtre
was knowen in Fraunce. the
kyng of Englande wrote in maner
of ioye to the Frenche kynge therof / 
and wrote nothyng therof to therle
of Derby who was the dukes ſon̄e.
Cap. CC .xxxv.
            
               TIdynges of the duke
of Lancaſters dethe came
in to Fraunce / & kyng Rycharde
of Englāde in maner
of ioye wrote therof to
the frenche kyng / and nat
to his coſyn therle of Derby / 
howe be it the erle knewe it as ſoone as
the Frenche kynge or ſoner / by ſuche men as
he had in Englande. Than the erle apparelled
hym and all his men in blacke / and cauſed
his obſequy to be done right honorably / 
at the whiche was the Frenche kyng and his
brother the duke of Orlyaunce / and all ye kynges
vncles / with a great nombre of prelates
and great lordes of Fraunce. For the erle of
Derby was welbeloued with euery mā / and
many were right ſorie of his trouble / for he
was a pleaſaunt knight and an honeſt ꝑſon / 
curteſſe and ſwete / & meke to euery man / and
euery man that ſawe hym ſaid / howe ye kyng
of Englande was nat well counſayled / that
he repealed / hym nat home agayne. And truely
to ſaye trouthe / if the kynge of Englande
had wyſely regarded the mater / and had ben
well counſayled / the mater had nat tourned
agaynſt hym as it dyde. For the erle of Derby / 
after the dethe of his father / was right
enherytoure to be duke of Lancaſtre / and to
haue been the ſeconde perſone of the realme / 
and by whom all the buſyneſſe of the realme
ſhulde chiefely haue paſſed. Alſo the kynge
and his counſayle ought to haue conſydred / 
howe often tymes the people of Englande
hadde ſtyrred and murmured agaynſt hym:
and ſhulde haue knowen / howe he was nat
very welbeloued of the people / nor of ſome
knightes / & other: and how that in ye duke of
Glouceſters dayes / he was often tymes in
daunger of his perſone. As whan the Londoners
and the counſaylles of dyuers good
townes in Englande cāe to hym to Eltham / 
and there made their requeſtes / that all ſubſidies
and ayes gyuen and graunted within
twentie yere / ſhulde haue ben fruſtrate and
fordone / or els they were determyned by the
conſent of the duke of Glouceſtre / and other
noble men of the Realme / to haue taken the
kynge and to haue ſette another to haue reygned
in his place / and to haue putte ye kyng
and the Quene in to a place / and ſo to haue
hadde meate and drinke as long as they had
lyued. In ſomoche / that the duke of Glouceſter
hadde deſyred a nephewe of his / ſonne
to the doughter of the duke of Clarence / who
was called Iohan erle of Marche: That he
wolde haue taken on hym the charge and gouernyng
of the realme / and that they wolde
haue made hym kyng. But the ſame erle excuſed
hym ſelfe honeſtly therfro. All theſe
thynges were apeaſed and layde downe / by
the wyſe ſadde meanes and prudence of the
ſayde duke of Lancaſtre / father to this ſayd
erle of Derby.
            IF kyng Richarde had wyſely conſydred
all theſe mats / he had reigned
in gretter ꝓſperite than euer he did
before. Kyng Richarde knewe all this well
ynough / and ſo by yuell counſayle the kynge
cauſed by colour of loue / the duke of Glouceſtre
to be taken and ledde to Calays / where
he was ſtrangled and murdered. Wherof
great brute was throughe out all the realme
with great grudge and murmuracyons / ſo
that it was at the poynt to haue depoſed the
ſayde kyng Richarde. Howe be it the duke
of Lancaſtre lyke a ſage and a prudent price
for all that the duke of Glouceſtre was his
brother / and that the murderyng of hym touched
hym nere to his herte. All thynges conſyred / 
and that he coude nat recouer agayne
his brother / wiſely and amiably he apeaſed
all theſe maters. And the kynge his nephue
more feared in Englāde than he was before.
All this the kynge ought to haue conſydred / 
and ſpecially howe therle of Derby was better
beloued with the people / than any other
man within the realme. All theſe thyngꝭ wyſely
cōſidred after the dethe of the duke rf Lā
               caſtre / 
the kyng ſhulde haue repealed therle
of Derby agayne in to the Realme / but the
kyng had no mynde ſo to do / for he dyd clene
the contrary / for incontynent he ſente his offycers
in to all the duke of Lācaſters landes

and toke the profites therof to hym ſelfe / and
ſayd / that as longe as therle of Derby ſtode
as a banyſſhed man / that he nor none of his
ſhulde receyue any reuenues of any landes
within the realme of Englande. And moreouer
(wherof the kyng was greatly blamed
of ſuche as loued the erle and his chyldren)
The kyng gaue awaye landes parteynynge
to the herytage of the duchy of Lancaſtre to
ſome of his ſeruauntes / ſuche as aſked them
for the whiche cauſe / many knyghtes & other
in Englande ſpake and ſaid. The kyng ſheweth
well that he oweth no good wyll to his
coſyn the erle of Derby / ſythe he wyll nat repeale
hym home agayne: and ſuffre his landes
to be gyuen awaye / where as therle and
his chyldren ſhulde be great membres in Englande / 
& a good ſtaffe for the kyng to leane
by. But he dothe the contrary / for he driueth
hym awaye / & ſo wyll kepe hym in this daū
               ger
and worſe if he coude. For he hath taken
to hym ſelfe his heritage / and cauſeth his offycers
to medell with the dukes landes / as
thoughe they were his owne. And if yt poore
tenauntes complayne of the iniuryes done
to them in their lordes abſence / they can nat
be harde: there is none yt wyll do them right
Alſo it is but a ſmall token of loue / that the
kyng beareth to the erle of Derby and to his
chyldren / for their herytage of Lācaſtre whiche
ſhulde come to thē by right enherytaūce / 
diſcended fro their grandame the lady Blanche / 
doughter to duke Henry of Lancaſtre.
The kyng gyueth parte therof away where
as it pleaſeth hym / & ſuche landes as ſhulde
fall to them by the right of the lady their mother / 
who was doughter to the erle of Herforde
and Northampton / and cōſtable of Englande.
The kynge gyueth parte therof at
his pleaſure. This is to moche done agaīſt
all ryght and reaſon / and to the diſpleaſure
of all the noble men of Englande: this can
nat longe endure vnamended. Thus the prelates / 
noble men / and commons in Englāde
cōmuned and murmured.
            
               IN lykewiſe in ye realme of Frā
               ce / 
ſuche men of honour as herde
ſpekynge of this mater / and
hadde ſene erle of Derby at
Parys / hadde great marueyle
therof / and ſayd one to another. As we thynke / 
the kynge of Englande hath takenne to
great a diſpleaſure with his coſyn the erle of
Derby / who is the greatteſt man in Englad
next hym ſelfe. He is a gracious knyght / curteſſe / 
meke / and tretable / and a man good to
be ſpoken vnto. The kyng of Englande knoweth
ſome other thynge by hym than we do / 
or elles the kynge is yuell counſayled. And
it is marueyle / that the Frenche kynge and
his brother the duke of Orlyaunce / and the
kynges vncles / do nat attemper the mater / 
for the erle is daylye amonge theym. They
ſhulde fynde beſt prouiſyon in this caſe / for
the kynge of Englande wyll do more for thē
than for any men / bicauſe he hath maried the
Frenche kynges doughter. But ſythe they
do nothynge therin / it is beſt we holde oure
peace and lette it paſſe. As for the Frenche
kynge & his brother and his vncles / thought
nothyng but good. They honoured and loued
greatly the erle of Derby / and deſyred
moche his company: and they ſawe well he
was a wydower and to marry / and that the
duke of Berry hadde a doughter a wydowe
of two huſbandes / ſhe was but yonge of a
xxiii. yere of age / & was named Mary. Her
fyrſt huſbāde was Loys of Bloys who died
yonge: and her ſecōde huſbande was ye lorde
Philyppe of Arthoys erle of Ewe / who died
in his retourne in Hungry: as ye haue herde
here before. This maryage was at apoynt
to haue concluded / for they in Fraūce knewe
well that the duke of Lancaſtre was a great
enherytoure in Englande / and the Frenche
kynge was well pleaſed therwith / bycauſe
his doughter was Quene of Englande. for
he thought that the company of thoſe two ladyes
togyder ſhulde be great pleaſure to thē
bothe / ſythe they were ſo nere of blode. And
therby the two realmes of Fraunce and Englande / 
ſhulde be the ſurer conioyned toguyder
in loue and peace / whiche was trewe / if
it might haue been accomplyſſhed. but kyng
Richarde of Englande & his coūſayle brake
all that mater / for the fortunes of this world
whiche are marueylous: nor a thynge that
ſhall be canne nat be eſchewed. The whiche
fortune of this kynge Richarde was ſo marueylous / 
that it is harde to thynke theron.
The kynge myght well haue remedyed the
mater if he had wolde / but that that ſhall be
ſhalbe. I ſhall ſhewe you what I Iohan

Froiſſarte / auctour of this hyſtorie / Herde
whan̄e I was but yonge in Englande / in a
place called Bertamſtede / whiche as at that
tyme parteyned to the price of Wales / father
to this ſayde kynge Rycharde / it was in the
yere of grace / a thouſande thre hundred thre
ſcore and two. And bycauſe ye ſame tyme the
prince and the princes ſhulde departe out of
Englande to go in to Acq̄tayne to kepe their
eſtate there. Kyng Edwarde his father and
quene Phillyppe my maiſtres / and Lyon duke
of Clarence / Iohan duke of Lancaſtre / &
the lorde Edmonde / who was after Erle of
Cambridge and duke of yorke / & their chyldren / 
were come to the ſaid maner place / to ſe
the prince and princes or they departed. And
as than I was of the age of .xxiiii. yere / and
one of my ſaid lady the quenes clerkes of her
chambre. And as I ſatte on a benche I herde
a knyght talkyng and deuyſinge among dyuers
ladyes and damoſelles of the Quenes / 
and ſayde to them. There is a booke in this
countrey called the Bruſt / & many men ſaye / 
it is of marueylous prophycies. But accordynge
to that booke / the realme and crowne
of Englande ſhulde nat retourne to the price
of Wales / nor yet to the duke of Clarence / 
nor that they ſhulde be kynges of England / 
though they were ſonnes to kyng Edwarde
but this knyght ſayd / that accordyng to that
boke / the crowne of Englande ſhulde come
to the houſe of Lancaſtre. The ſame ſeaſon
whan this knyght ſpake theſe wordes / this
ſayd Hēry erle of Derby was nat borne / nor
yet ſeuyn yere after. but yet in my dayes the
ſame wordes tooke effecte / for I ſawe after / 
the ſame Henry erle of Derby kynge of Englande.

               AS ſoone as kyng Rycharde
kyng of Englande
herde of the treatie of the
maryage bytwene the erle
of Derby and the duke of
Berryes doughter / & that
the parties were nerehāde
accorded / he toke thoſe newes to great dyſpleaſure / 
and ſayd to the erle of Saliſbury
in whom he had great affyaunce. ye muſt or
dayne you to go in to Fraunce with letters
of credence / to our father in lawe the Frenche
kynge / and to our frendes his brother &
vncles. And ſhewe them fro vs / that in no
wyſe they conclude any treatie or alyaunce
of maryage / with ſuche a traytour as is the
erle of Derby / who wolde betray his naturall
ſouerayne lorde. And for the remynaunt
of the mater ye are wyſe ynough / do ſo therin
that I maye can you thanke / and that the
maryage maye be broken. The erle of Saliſbury
ſayde. Sir / I ſhall do ryght well
your cōmaundement. But ſir / if it myght be
broken by ſome other meanes / or by ſome other
perſone / I requyre youre grace it maye
ſo be. Sir quod the kynge excuſe you natte / 
for I wyll and alſo I praye you do this meſſage / 
& whatſoeuer ſhall fall therof I ſhall
ſuſtayne you. Well ſir quod the erle / ſithe ye
cōmaunde me ſo ſpecially / and that I ſe the
mater toucheth you nere I ſhall do it / thoughe
I be lothe therto. ye ſhall go quod the
kynge and make haſte / or this alyaunce be
concluded. Than the Erle prepared for his
departure. The letters of Credence written
and ſealed / he departed fro the kynge / who
was at that tyme at Leades / and the Quene
alſo. The erle made haſte and came to Douer / 
and ſo toke the See and arryued at Calays / 
and there founde the erle of Huntyngton / 
who was capitayne of Calais and brother
to the kynge. The Erle ſhewed vnto
hym all his buſyneſſe / and ſo taryed nat longe
at Calays / but roode to Amyence and ſo
to Parys / and all they waye that he rode he
hadde good chere / and was lodged at the
whyte horſe. And whan he had chaūged him
he wente to the kynge and to the quene / and
to yt other lordes / and delyuered his letters
of credence. Whan the kyng had reed the letters / 
he toke the erle aparte and demaunded
what was his credence. The erle at length

ſhewed his charge / and named the Erle of
Derby traytour agaynſt his naturall lorde.
Whan the Frenche kyng herde thoſe wordes
he was in great diſpleaſure / for he loued ſo
the erle of Derby / that he wolde here none yuell
ſpoken of him / and toke the letters of credence
agayne to the erle of Saliſbury / and
ſayd. Erle / we beleue you well ynoughe / but
our ſonne of Englande is to ſore moued agaynſt
oure coſyn of Derby / and we marueyle
greatly / that his yuell wyll contyneweth ſo
longe / for we thynke he ſhulde be the better
furnyſſhed if he were about hym / and to be
nexte of his counſayle. Sir quod the erle of
Saliſbury / I do but as I am cōmaunded.
That is trewe quod the kyng / we are nat diſpleaſed
with you / & paraduenture our ſonne
of Englande knoweth more than we do: do
your meſſage as ye were charged / and ſo he
dyde / and to the duke of Berrey alſo. The
duke gaue none aunſwere therto / but wente
to the kyng and demaunded of hym what newes
he hadde out of Englande. The kynge
ſhewed hym all / as the erle of Saliſburye
had ſayde. Vpon thoſe newes the kyng and
his vncles aſſembled togyder ſecretely. than
the Frenche kynge ſayd. The kynge of Englande
by lykelyhode douteth greatly therle
of Derby / or elles paraduēture he knoweth
ſuche thynges as we knowe nat / nor can nat
come to oure knowledge. And we ought rather
to owe our fauoure to the kynge of Englande
than̄e to the erle of Derby / ſythe the
kynge is ioyned with vs by maryage. And
he wyll take it in great diſdayne ſythe we be
enfourmed of his pleaſure / if we ſhulde do
the contrary / and marry the erle of Derby to
the counteſſe of Ewe. It behoueth vs rather
to diſſymule & kepe theſe newes ſecrete / tyll
the erle of Saliſbury be retourned. Vpon
this peynt the kyng and his vncles reſted.
            
               WHan the erle of Saliſbury had
done his meſſage / he tooke his
leaue and departed. The Frenche
kynge was more diſpleaſed
with his cōmyng than ioyfull / 
for he delyuered agayne the erle of Salyſbury
his letters of credence / and wolde nat
kepe them / he loued ſo well the erle of Derby / 
who knewe of the erle of Salyſburies
beynge at Parys / but he ſawe hym nat / for
he was departed without ſpekyng with him
and retourned to Calays / and to in to Englande / 
and ſhewed the kynge of Englande
howe he hadde ſpedde. Whan the erle or Derby
knewe that the erle of Saliſbury was departed
fro Parys / without ſpekynge with
hym / in his mynde he was ſoore diſpleaſed / 
and thought the matter went nat well. than
his counſayle ſayde to hym. Sir / ſhortely
ye ſhall parceyue ſome other maters / that ye
haue nat herde of as yet / thoughe it be kepte
priuye fro you. Theſe Frenchmen are wyſe
and cloſe. It maye be ſo / that the kyng of Englande / 
and ſuche as be of his ſecte are diſpleaſed / 
with that the Frenche kyng maketh
you ſo good chere as he dothe. And paraduē
               ture
it is ſpoken in Englande / howe ye ſhulde
mary the duke of Berryes doughter / whiche
pleaſeth nat the kynge of Englande / and
therfore he wyll do what he can to breke that
maryage / and if it be ſo ye ſhall ſhortly here
therof.
            LOoke as they ymagined ſo it was / 
for within a moneth after the erle of
Saliſbury was departed fro Parys / 
ſuche of therle of Derbies parte as had
the treatie of the ſayde maryage in hande.
They ſpake agayne of the mater to the duke
of Berryes counſayle / who had their charge
what they ſhulde anſwere. They ſayd. ſirs
Whan my lorde the erle of Derby is in the
kynges preſence / and the duke of Orlyaunce
and his vncles preſente / than lette my lorde
the erle of Derby ſpeke hym ſelfe / for we can
ſaye no more to the mater. Therle of Derby
who thought none yuell / but thought thoſe
wordes hadde ben ſpoken / to the entent to haue
proched nerer to the poynt / for the kynge
and his counſayle made hym as good chere
thanne / as euer they dyde before. The Erle
thought to ſpeke in the mater / whan he ſawe
conuenyent tyme. And on a daye whan̄e he
ſawe the kyng and the lordes togyder / he began
to ſpeke of this maryage. Than the duof
Burgoyne / who hadde the charge to aunſwere
hym ſayde. Coſyn of Derby / we haue
nothynge to do to gyue in maryage ouer coſyn
to a traytour. With that woorde the erle
of Derby was greatly abaſſhed / & chaūged
colour & ſayd. Sir / I am here in the kynges
preſence / I wyll anſwere to this. I was neuer
traytour nor neuer thought trayſon: & if

there be any perſone yt wyll charge me with
trayſon I am redy to anſwere / nowe or whā
it ſhall pleaſe the kynge / here beyng preſent.
Nay coſyn quod the kyng / I beleue ye ſhall
fynde no man in Fraunce that wyll chalenge
your honoure / for the wordes that myne vncle
hath ſpoken came out of Englande. than
the erle kneled downe and ſayd. Sir / I beleue
it well. But god defende me and all my
frendes / and confounde all myne ennemyes.
The Frenche kynge toke vp the erle / & ſayd.
Coſyn / apeace your ſelfe / euery thynge ſhall
tourne to the beſt. And whan̄e euery thynge
is agreed and at peace / than̄e we maye well
ſpeke & treate of maryage / but fyrſt ye muſt
take poſſeſſion in the duchy of Lancaſtre / for
that is the vſage in Fraunce / and in dyuers
countreis on this ſyde the See. That if a
lorde ſhall marry by the conſent of his ſoueraygne
lorde / he muſt endowe his wyfe. and
therwith they had ſpyces and wyne / and ceſſed
of that cōmunycacion / and euery man departed
to their owne lodgynges.
            
               WHan the erle of Derby was cōe
to his lodgyng he was ſore diſpleaſed / 
and nat without a cauſe.
Whan he / who was reputed
one of the treweſt knyghtes of
the worlde (in the preſēce of the frenche kyng
who loued hym well / & had ſhewed him many
curteſies) ſhuld be reputed as a traytour
and that thoſe wordes ſhulde cōe out of Englande
and brought by the erle of Saliſburye.
He was therwith in a great malencoly / 
his counſayle apeaſed hym as well as they
coude / & ſayd. Sir / he that wyll lyue in this
worlde / muſt endure ſomtyme trouble. Confort
you for this tyme and be pacient / and parauenture
herafter ye ſhall haue great ioye
and glorie. And ſir / of al ye lordꝭ on this ſyde
the ſee / the frenche kyng loueth you beſt. and
we ſe well he wolde enploye his payne to brī
               ge
you to ioye. and ſir / ye ought to gyue him
and his vncles great thāke / in that they kept
this mater ſecrete / tyll the erle of Saliſbury
was deꝑted. yea ſirs quod the erle / I thynke
it had ben better it had ben ſhewed me in his
preſence / that I myght haue made a ſufficiēt
excuſe before yt kyng and all the lordes. thus
I ſhall abyde ſtyll in blame tyll the mater be
otherwyſe declared. Sir quod they all / treſpaſſes
can nat be amended at the fyrſt daye.
Sir ſuffre / let the tyme ryn: we beleue your
buſyneſſe in Englande dothe better than ye
be ware of. The loue that is in the hertes of
the people in Englande towardes you with
their good prayers / by ye grace of god / ſhall
ſhortely delyuer you out of all daungers.
This they ſayd to recōfort their lorde / who
was ſore diſconforted / and their ſayeng was
ſoner trewe than they were ware of.
            ANone it was knowen in Englande
howe therle of Saliſbury had ben
in Fraūce with the frenche kynge &
his vncles / and borne letters thyder / conteynyng
howe the erle of Derby was falſely ꝑiured
and a traytour. Of the whiche dyuers
noble men and prelates were ſore troubled / 
and were nothynge contente with the erle of
Saliſbury / and ſaid generally / that he was
ſoore to blame to take on hym the charge / to
beare in to Fraunce any ſuche wordes / vpon
as trewe a man as lyued. A daye wyll come
that he ſhall repent the tyme / yt euer he ſpake
the worde. ye maye well knowe / the Londoners
were greatly diſpleaſed / and murmured
agaynſt the kyng and his counſayle / 
& ſayd. A gētyll knight erle of Derby / great
enuy is there agaynſt you. It is nat ſuffycient
for the kynge and his counſayle to driue
you out of the realme / but alſo to accuſe you
of trayſon / to putte you to the more ſhame &
rebuke. Well / euery thynge muſte haue his
tourne. Alas quod the people: What faulte
or treſpaſſe hath your children done / that the
kynge taketh thus awaye fro thē their herytage / 
whiche ought to be theirs by ryght ſucceſſyon?
This thynge can nat longe abyde
in this caſe without chaunge / nor we can nat
ſuffre it. Thus anone after the retourne of
the erle of Saliſbury out of Fraunce / kyng
Richarde cauſed a iuſtes to be cryed and publyſſhed
throughe out his realme / to Scotlande / 
to be at Wynſore / of .xl. knyghtes and
xl. ſquyers agaynſt all cōmers. And they to
be aparelled in grene with a whyte faucon &
the quene to be there / well acōpanied 
                  〈◊〉
                a

quene beyng there ī gret neblenes / but there
were but fewe lordes or noble men / for mo
thā .ii. ꝑtes of ye lordes & knightes / & other of
the realme of Englande had yt kyng in ſuche

hatered / what for the banyſſhyng of the erle
of Derby / and the iniuryes that he had done
to his chyldren / and for the dethe of the duke
of Glouceſtre / who was ſlayne in the caſtell
of Calais / and for the dethe of the erle of Arū
               dell
who / was beheeded at Lōdon. The kynred
of theſe lordes came nat to this feeſt / nor
but fewe other. And at the ſame feeſt the kynge
ordayned to go in to Irelande / to enploy
his men in that voyage / and ſo he departed
and lefte the Quene with her trayne ſtyll at
Wyndſore / and the kynge rode to Briſtowe / 
and there made all his prouyſion / and he had
ten thouſande knightes and ſquiers / and ten
thouſande archers. Whan̄e the Londoners
knewe that the kyng was goyng in that voyage
they began to murmure / and ſaid amonge
themſelfe. Nowe gothe Richarde of Burdeaux
the waye to Briſtowe / and ſo in to yrelande / 
whiche wyll be to his diſtruction. He
ſhall neuer retourne agayne with ioye / no

            ¶Howe kynge Richarde ordayned
to go in to the marcheſſe of
Irelande. Cap.
CC.xxxvii.
            
               THere were many knightes
and ſquyers in the kynges
company / that ſhulde
go with hym in to Irelāde
that were nat cōtent with
hym / and wente in maner
with an yuell wyll / & ſayd
oftentymes one to another. Our kynge gouerneth
hym ſelfe foliſſhely / and beleueth yuell
counſayle. Suche wordes were ſo multiplyed / 
that the lorde Henry Percy and ſir
Henry his ſon̄e ſpake certayne wordes / whiche
came to the kynges knowlege and to his
counſayle / and it was ſayd to the kyng. Sir
the wordes ought nat to be ſuffred / that the
erle of Northumberlande and his ſon̄e hath
ſpoken / for it is to ſette your ſubiettes agaīſt
you. It muſt behoue you to correcte all theſe
rebelles one after another / wherby they that
be greatteſt ſhall doute you / and take enſample.
That is trewe quod the kyng / but than
what is beſte to do. Sir quod they / they be
nat here with you / but they ought to come. &
whan they become / call them before you / and
than by the erle of Saliſbury and by ſome
other / as it ſhall pleaſe you / lette it be reherſed
to them / the yuell wordes that they haue
ſpoken againſt you and your coūſayle. Thā
ſhall you here what anſwere they wyll make:
and thervpon ye maye taken aduyſe / wheder
ye wyll correcte them by priſon / or other
wyſe. Well ſirs quod the kynge / ye ſay well / 
this ſhalbe done. The erle of Northumberlande
and his ſon̄e had good frendes in that
armye / ſo that ſome of them knewe the kynges
entent: And they ſent ſuche worde to the
erle and to his ſonne / that they ſhulde natte
come in the kynges preſēce / nor to go in that
iourney. For they hadde worde that if they
dyde / it ſhulde nat be for their welthe / but to
their great dōmage / for the kynge was ſore
enformed againſt them. Whan they had this
warnynge / they ſtopped their cōmyng to the
kyng / and nat without good cauſe. For they
were ſhewed that & if they came / they ſhulde
be in ieopardye of their lyues. Whan ye kynges
counſayle ſawe that therle and his ſon̄e
came nat / they ſayd to the kyng. Sir / nowe
ye maye ſe whyder we dyde enforme you of
the trouthe or nat. ye maye ſe therle and his
ſonne diſdayneth to ſerue you / for they wyll
nat come at youre cōmaundement / and that
ſhall ye ſe if ye ſende for them. And I ſhall
ſende for them quod the kyng. Than letters
were written & ſente by notable meſſangers / 
to therle & to the lorde Henry Percy his ſon.
The content of the letters was / that incontynent
without delaye vpon the ſight of thoſe
letters / that they ſhulde come to ye kyng and
do their duetie / as they were bounde to do.
Theſe meſſangers iourneyed ſo longe / that
they came to fayre caſtell of the erles / ſtandyng
on the fronter of Scotlande. The meſſanger
acquyted hym well in doynge of his
meſſage / as he was cōmaūded. Therle reed
his letters at length / and than ſhewed them
to his ſonne. Than they toke aduiſe to make

the meſſanger good chere / and to write agayn
to the kynge in excuſynge of them ſelfes / howe
they coulde nat come out of their countrey as
at that tyme / and howe that the kyng had men
ynowe to acōplyſſhe his iourney beſyde them.
The meſſangers retourned to the kynge / and
delyuered the erles lettre. The kynge redde it
the whiche anſwere was nothynge pleaſaunt
to the kynge nor to his counſayle / and thanne
for this cauſe and for other thynges that were
layde to the Erles charge and to his ſonnes / 
they were openly banyſſhed the realme of Englande / 
tyll ye kyng dyd repeale them agayne.
This was publyſſhed through out all the cyties
and good townes of Englande / and ſpecyally
in London / wherof the londoners had
great marueyle / nor they coulde nat knowe
iuſtly for what cauſe it was / for the erle and
his ſonne were reputed for noble and as valyaunt
men as any within the realme. Some
ſayd / it cōmeth by ſome of the kynges counſayle
that hateth them / whiche counſayle wyll
diſtroy the kyng at laſt / peraduenture the erle
and his ſonne haue ſpoken ſome wordes vpon
the kynge and his counſayle / for the yuell gouernynge
of the realme / & coulde nat be herde
though they ſaid the trouth / and for their true
ſayeng nowe they be puniſſhed / but we thinke
herafter they wyll be punyſſhed yt nowe iudge
them. Thus the londoners and other ſpake of
this mater. The erle had a brother a valiaunt
knight ſir Thomas percy / who had of a longe
tyme done many noble ſeruyces to the kynge
of Englande. whan the erle knewe that he and
his ſonne were banyſſhed the realme / he toke
it for an vnreaſonable punyſſhment without
cauſe. Than he ſente for all his frendes in the
countrey / ſuche as he coulde get togyther / for
many of his lygnage were with the kynge to
go in to Irelande. The erle toke counſayle of
them what was beſt to do ſythe the kynge had
banyſſhed hym without cauſe. Than he was
counſayled to ſende in to the realme of Scotlande / 
and to deſyre the king there that he and
his ſonne might abyde peaſably in Scotlande / 
tyll the kynge of Englande were apeaſed
of his dyſpleaſure. Thus therle ſent to kynge
Robert of Scotlande / and the kyng & the erle
Archambalt Duglas / and the other lordes of
Scotlande condiſcendyd lyghtly to the erles
deſyre / & ſent the erle worde howe they ſhulde
be gladly receyued / and alſo if they neded of
fyue or ſyre hundred ſpeares / if they were ſignyfied
of the tyme they ſhulde be redy to ſerue
them. This meſſage pleaſed greatly the erle
and his lygnage / and ſo the erle taryed ſtyll in
his countrey amonge his frendes / for kynge
Rycharde and his counſayle had ſo moche to
do in ſorte ſeaſon after / that they had no layſer
to do any dyſpleaſure to the erle nor to his
ſonne / as ye ſhall here after in this hyſtory.
            KInge Rycharde thus beynge aboute
Briſtowe / than the ſtate generally of
all men in Englande began to murmure
and to ryſe one agaynſt another / and
mynyſtrynge of iuſtyce was clene ſtopped vp
in all courtes of Englande / wherof the valyaunt
men and prelates / who loued reſte and
peace / and were glad to paye their duetyes / 
were greatly abaſſhed / for there roſe in the realme
companyes in dyuers rowtes / kepynge
the feldes and hygh wayes / ſo that marchauntes
durſte nat ryde abrode to excercyſe their
marchaundyſe for doute of robbynge / and no
man knewe to whome to cōplayne to do them
ryght / reaſone / and iuſtyce / whiche thynges
were ryght preiudyciall and dyſpleaſaunt to
the good people of Englande / for it was contrary
to their accuſtomable vſage / for all people
laborers and marchauntes in Englande
were wonte to lyue in reſt and peace / and to
occupy their marchaundyſe peaſably / and the
laborers to labour their landes quyetly / and
than it was contrary / for whan marchauntes
rode fro towne to towne with their marchaundyſe / 
and had outher golde or ſyluer in their
purces / it was taken fro them / and fro other
men / and labourers out of their houſes. theſe
companyons wolde take whete / ootes / bufes / 
muttons / porkes / & the pore men durſte ſpeke
no worde. theſe yuell dedes dayly multyplyed
ſo that great complayntes and lamentacyons
were made therof through out the realme / and
the good people ſayde / the tyme is chaunged
vpon vs fro good to yuell / euer ſythe the dethe
of good kynge Edwarde the thyrde / in whoſe
dayes iuſtyce was well kepte and mynyſtred.
In his dayes there was no man ſo hardy in
Englande to take a hen or a chekyn / or a ſhepe
without he had payed trewly for it / and now
                  •
               
a dayes all that we haue is taken fro vs / and
yet we dare nat ſpeke / theſe thinges canne nat
longe endure / but that Englande is lykely to

be loſte without recouery. We haue a kynge
nowe that wyll do nothyng / he entendeth but
to ydelneſſe and to acomplyſſhe his pleaſure / 
and by that he ſheweth / he careth nat howe euery
thynge gothe / ſo he maye haue his wyll.
it were tyme to prouyde for remedy / or els out
enemyes wyll reioyſe & mocke vs / our kynge
hath ſette his brother the erle of Huntyngdon
at Calais / therby peraduenture may be made
ſome yuell treatie and bargayne for the towne
of Calays with the frenche men / and rendre
in to their handes that thynge that is moſt neceſſary
for the realme of Englande / for if Calays
were rendred to the Frenche men / Englande
was neuer ſo abaſſhed as it ſhulde be
than / and good cauſe why / for than ſhulde be
loſt the chiefe key of Englande.
            THus multyplyed the lamentacyons
and murmurynge in Englande / and
the prelates and other ryche men of
the realme came to London to dwell / there to
be in the better ſuretie. They of the lygnages
of ſuche lordes as the kynge had put to dethe
and baniſſhed the realme / they were gladde of
all this / and wolde that more trouble had ben
in the realme / and the cytezins of Lōdon who
were ryche / and lyued by their marchaundyſe
as well coraunt by ſee as by lande / and kepte
therby great eſtate / and by enſample of them
all the remnaūt of the realme lyghtly folowed / 
they ſawe well that as great myſchiefe was
lykely to folowe in the realme / as was ſometyme
in kynge Edwarde the ſecondes dayes / 
whan the lorde Spencer cauſed the kynge to
put out of the realme the quene Iſabell and
Edward her ſonne / and wolde haue diſtroyed
them / and wyſte nat why / and ſo were out of
the Realme more than thre yere / but fynally
whan the men in Englande and ſpecyally the
londoners ſawe howe that the kynge was ſo
aſotted on this ſyr Hugh ſpenſer / they prouyded
for a remedy / for they ſente ſecretly to the
quene Iſabell that if ſhe coulde get thre hundred
men of warre / & to come in to Englande / 
ſhe ſhulde fynde ye greateſt parte of the realme
and the londoners redy to receyue her / and to
put her in poſſeſſyon of the realme / whervpon
the quene founde the lorde Iohan of Haynalt
lorde of Beaumont and of Chynay / and brother
to the erle Guillyam of Haynalte / who
what for loue and pytie toke on him the vyage
to brynge the quene and her ſonne in to Englande
with four hundred men of warre / and
ſo aryued in Englande / and by the ayde of the
londoners the quene atchyued her enterpriſe / 
for without their ayde it wolde haue ben hard
to haue come to paſſe. and ſo kynge Edwarde
was taken at the caſtell of Briſtowe / and ſet
in priſone in the caſtell of Berkley / and ſuche
as fauoured him ſlayne and put to execuſion / 
and Edwarde his ſonne crowned kynge at
Weſtmynſter. All this ye londoners ryght well
remembred / for they that were yonge herde
this reported of their elders / and ſome founde
it in writynge / and they ſayd ſecretly one to a
nother. Our fathers and anteceſſours of olde
tyme prouyded for theſe greate miſchiefes / and
we thinke there was neuer greater cauſe than
nowe at this preſent tyme / for ſuffer this kyng
Rycharde to haue his wyll and he wyll waſte
and dyſtroy all / for ſythe he was kynge there
hath nat been in Englande ſuche proſperyte
as was before / he ſheweth nat that the prince
of Wales ſhulde be his father / for if he had / he
wolde haue folowed his condicions and haue
taken great pleaſure in his prowes / and nat
to lyue in reſte and eaſe as he dothe / for he loueth
nothynge but ſporte and ydelneſſe with
ladyes / and to be alwayes in their company / 
and to beleue men of ſmall reputacyon / and to
gather great rycheſſe / and diſtroy the realme / 
whiche thynges ought nat to be ſuffred. And
bycauſe that valyaunt man the duke of Glouceſtre
ſawe clerely yt the maters in Englande
went nat as they ſhulde do by right / and ſawe
howe dayly it was worſe and worſe / and bycauſe
he ſpake playnely therof / the traytours
that be about the kinge cauſed hym to be murthered / 
and in lykewyſe the good erle of Arundell.
and haue driuen out of the realme that valyaunt
yonge knight Henry of Lancaſtre erle
of Derby / by whome the realme myght and
ought to be counſayled and ſuſteyned / and by
his four ſonnes that he hath. And yet for more
crueltie beſyde the dōmage that they cauſe the
father to ſuffre out of the realme / they dyſenheryte
the chyldren / and the herytage that was
their auntes / the lady dame Blanche of Lancaſtre
is dayly gyuen awaye / to them that are
nat worthy to haue theym. And alſo bycauſe
the erle of Northumberlande and his ſonne
the lorde Henry Percy haue ſomwhat ſpoken
acordynge to reaſone / kynge Rycharde hath

banyſſhed them / it is well apparaūt that with
in a ſhorte tyme there ſhall neuer a valyaunt
man be lefte in the realme / wherfore all wyll
rynne to nought without remedy be founde
ſhortely / and we thynke the beſt remedy were
to ſende for the erle of Derby / who / leſeth his
ſeaſon in Fraunce / and whan he is come lette
hym haue the gouernaunce of the realme / that
he may refourme all yuell / and bringe it in to
good ſtate / and lette them be punyſſhed that
haue deſerued / and let Richarde of Burdeaux
be taken and ſette in the towre of London / and
all his fautes put in writynge in artycles / of
the whiche there wyll be founde a great nombre / 
and by that tyme they be examined / it ſhall
be ſene clerely that he is nat worthy to beare a
crowne / nor to kepe a realme / for his owne de
des ſhall confounde hym.

myſchiefe that they ſawe apparaunt in Englande / 
they had dyuers ſecrete counſayles to
gyther / and with them certayne prelates and
other knyghtes of the realme / and they concluded
to ſende in to Fraunce for the erle of Derby / 
and were determyned whan he were come
to ſhewe hym the yuell gouernynge of kynge
Rycharde / and to put to hym the crowne and
gouernynge of the realme of Englande / and
ſo to make hym kynge and his heyres for euer
ſo that he wyll kepe the realme in all good vſages.
Than it was thought that he that ſhulde
go in that meſſage muſt be a wyſe man and of
good credence / for they thought it ſhulde be a
great mater to gette the erle of Derby out of
Fraūce / for they ſaid that for any ſymple wordes
of a meane meſſanger / or for any letters / 
he wolde gyue no faythe there to / but rather
thynke it ſhulde be to betraye hym. Than the
archebyſſhoppe of Caunterbury a man of honoure
and prudence / was deſyred to do that
meſſage / who for the cōmon profyte of the realme
acorded to go at their deſyres / and ordeyned
for his departure ſo wyſely yt none knewe
therof / but ſuche as ought to knowe it / and ſo
he toke a ſhyppe at London / and but ſeuen all
onely with hym / and ſo paſt without any parell
and came to Sluſe in Flaunders / and fro
thens to Ardenbourge / and ſo to Gaunte / to
And warpe / to Athe in Brabant / & to Conde / 
and ſo to Valencennes / and there toke his lodgynge
at the ſigne of the Swanne in the market
place / and there taryed a thre dayes / and refreſſed
himſelfe. He rode nat lyke no byſſhop
but lyke a monke pylgryme / and dyſcouered
to no man what he was nor what he entended
to do. The fourth day he departed and toke a
man to be his guyde to Parys / ſayenge howe
he wolde go a pylgrymage to ſaint More. He
dyd ſo moch that he came thyder where as the
erle of Derby was at a place called vyncetour
beſyde Parys. Whan the erle of Derby ſawe
the byſſhop of Caunterbury cōmynge to him / 
his herte and ſpyrites reioyſed / and ſo dyd all
ſuche as were aboute him / for he thought well
than to here ſome newes oute of Englande.
The byſſhoppe ſhewed nat as than the cauſe
of his cōmynge / but diſſymuled bycauſe euery
man ſhuld nat knowe his entent / and therfore
to couer his buſyneſſe / he ſayd openly / he was
come on pylgrymage to ſaynt Mors. All ſuche
as were aboute the erle thought it had ben
ſo. Whan the byſſhop ſawe his tyme he toke a
parte the erle of Derby alone in to a chambre / 
and cloſed the dore to them. Than the byſſhop
ſhewed the erle the debylyte of the realme of
Englande / and of the deſolacyon therof / and
howe iuſtyce had no place to reygne for faute
of a good kinge / and howe certayne valyaunt
men and prelates / with the londoners and other
ingenerall / had deuiſed a remedy / and for
that cauſe he was ſente thyder to hym / to deſyre
him to retourne in to Englande / and they
wolde make hym kynge / bycauſe yt Rycharde
of Burdeaulx had doone and conſented to be

done ſo many yuell dedes that all the people
ſorowed it / and are redy to ryſe agaynſt hym.
and therfore ſyr nowe is the tyme or neuer / for
you to ſeke for your delyueraūce and profyte / 
and for the welth of your chyldren. for if ye entende
nat to helpe your ſelfe and theym alſo / 
none other wyll. for Rycharde of Burdeaux
gyueth to them of his chambre & to other dayly / 
parte of your enherytaūce and of your chyldrens / 
of the whiche many valyaunt men and
the londoners were ſore dyſpleaſed therwith / 
if they coude amended it / but they durſt neuer
ſpeke tyll nowe. But bycauſe the kynge hath
yuell vſed hym ſelfe agaynſt you and agaynſt
your vncle the duke of Glouceſtre / who was
taken by nyght and conueyed to Calays and
there murdered / and the erle of Arundell beheeded
without tytell of any good reaſon / and
the erle of Warwyke exyled / and you banyſſhed / 
and thus the realme of Englande is nere
dyſheryted of all noble men / by whome the realme
ſhulde be ſuſteyned. And alſo the kynge
hath banyſſhed the erle of Northumberlande
and the lorde Percy his ſonne / bycauſe they
ſpake ſomewhat agaynſt the kynges gouernaunce
and his counſayle. Thus they dayly
encreaſe in doynge yuell / and none dare ſpeke
agaynſt it / great parte of the realme haue pytie
therof. and therfore they deſyre you to ſlepe
no lenger / but to take leaue of yt frenche kynge
and retourne in to Englande / there ſhall you
be receyued with ioy. and all this that I haue
ſayd they wyll fyrmely vpholde / for they deſyre
to haue none other kynge but you / ye are
ſo well beloued in the realme.
            WHan the erle had herde the byſſhops
wordes at length / he was nat haſty
in gyuenge of aunſwere / but leaned
out at a wyndowe lokynge downe in to a gardeyne / 
and ſtudyed a certayne ſpace and had
many imagynacions / at laſt he tourned hym
to the archebyſſhop and ſayd. Syr / your wordes
cauſeth me to ſtudy. Lothe I wolde be to
take on me this enterpriſe / and lothe I wolde
be to leaue it. for I knowe well that it wyll be
longe or I canne retourne in to Englande / 
without it be by the ſame meanes / as ye haue
declared. Lothe I wolde be to enclyne to your
wordes / for the Frenche kynge here and the
frenchmen do to me / and haue done / & wyll do
(if I lyſt here to tary) all the honour and curteſye
that I canne deſyre. And if ſo be by reaſone
of your wordes and promeſſe of the londoners
my good frendes / that I ſhulde apply
and agree to their wylles and deſyre / and that
therby kynge Rycharde ſhulde be taken and
dyſtroyed / I ſhulde in that caſe beare great
blame / wherof I wolde be tyght lothe / if any
other meanes might be founde. Sir quod the
byſſhoppe / I am ſent hyther to you in hope of
all goodneſſe / call to you your counſayle and
ſhewe them what I haue ſayd / and I ſhall alſo
ſhewe them the cauſe of my cōmynge / and
I thynke they wyll nat counſayle you to the
contrary. That ſhall I do quod the erle / for
ſuche a weyghty mater requyreth counſayle.
Than the erle called to hym his counſayle ſuche
as he truſted beſt. Whan they were before
hym than the erle cauſed the byſſhop to ſhewe
them all the mater / and the cauſe of his commynge
thyder. Than the erle demaūded counſayle
what was beſte for hym to do. They all
aunſwered with one voyce / ſyr / god hathe taken
pytie of you / howe ſo euer ye do refuſe nat
this bargayne / for ye ſhal neuer haue a better.
and ſurely / who ſo euer wyll enquyre of your

Edwarde / ſomtyme kynge of Englande. ſyr
thanke the londoners your good frendes who
wyll helpe to delyuer you out of daunger / and
haue pytie on your chyldren / and of the deſolacyon

well what wrōges and iniuryes this
Rycharde of Burdeaux hath done to you and
dothe dayly. for whan the maryage bytwene
you and the counteſſe of Ewe was nere at a
poynte / dyd nat the erle of Salyſbury breke
it? and called you traytoure in the preſence of
the frenche kynge and other lordes / whiche
wordes are nat to be pardoned / but ye ought

Than it was deuyſed howe they might paſſe

and to ſe the duke / whome he called his

frenche kynge thought nothyng but well / and
ſo gaue hym lyghtly leaue. Than the erle deſyred

He graunted his deſyre. So to make ſhorte / 
the Erle ordeyned all his buſyneſſe by great
wyſdome / and toke his leaue of all the lordes
of Fraunce / ſuche as were there as than / and
he gaue great gyftes to the kynges offycers

               WHan duke Iohan of Bretaygne
knewe that his nephewe the erle

he was therof ryght ioyfull / for
he loued alwayes the Duke of

            ¶Howe the erle of Derby aryued in
Englande / and howe he was receyued
of the londoners.
Cap. CC.xl.
            
               THus the duke of Bretaygne
and the erle of Derby
were louyngely concluded
togyder / and the erle taryed
there a certayne ſpace
& made as though he wold
haue taryed ſtyll there / and
in the meane ſeaſone the erle made his prouyſyon
at Wannes. And whan all thynge was
redy / the duke and the erle came thyder / and
whan the wynd ſerued / the erle of Derby and
his company tooke the ſee / he had with hym
thre ſhyppes of warre to conducte hym in to
Englande / and the further they ſayled the better
wynde they had / ſo that within two dayes
and two nyghtes they aryed at Plūmouth
in Englande / and iſſued out of their ſhyppes
and entred in to the towne lytell and lytell. the
bayly of Plūmouthe / who had charge of the
towne vnder the kynge / had great marueyle
whanne he ſawe ſo moche people and men of
warre entre in to the towne. But the byſſhop
of Caunterbury apeaſed him / and ſayd howe
they were menne of warre that wolde do no
harme in the realme of Englande / ſent thyder
by the duke of Bretaygne to ſerue the kynge
and the realme. Therwith the bayly was contente / 
and the erle of Derby kept hym ſelfe ſo
priuy in a chaumbre / that none of the towne
knewe hym. Than the byſſhoppe of Caunterbury
wrote letters ſygned with his hande
to London / ſygnyfienge the cōmynge of the
erle of Derby / and ſente them by a ſuffycyent
man in poſt / who tooke freſſhe horſes by the
waye / and came to London the ſame daye at
night / and paſſed ouer the bridge and ſo came
to the mayres lodgynge / who as than was a
bedde / and as ſone as the mayre knewe that a
meſſāger was come fro the byſſhop of Caunterbury / 
he roſe out of his bedde and made
the meſſanger to entre in to his chambre / who
delyuered hym a lettre fro the byſſhoppe of
Caunterbury. The mayre redde it and reioyſed
greatly of thoſe newes / and incontynent
he ſente of his ſeruauntes fro houſe to howſe / 
princypally to ſuche as were of counſayle of
ſendynge for the Erle of Derby. They were
all gladde of that tydynges / and in contynent
there aſſembled togyther of the moſte notableſt
men of the cytie to the nombre of two hundred / 
& they ſpake togyder / and helde no longe
counſayle for the caſe required it nat / but they
ſayd / lette vs apparell our ſelfe and go and receyue
the duke of Lancaſtre / ſaythe we agreed
to ſende for hym / the archebyſſhoppe of Caunterbury
hathe well doone his deuoyre / ſeynge
he hath brought hym in to Englande. Than
they dyd choſe certayne men to go abrode to
publyſſhe the erles cōmynge to lordes knyghtes / 
and ſquyers / ſuche as were of their party / 
and mo than fyue hundred of the londoners
tooke their horſes / and they had ſo great deſyre
to go forthe that they were lothe to tarye
one for a nother. The erle of Derby taryed
nat longe at Plummouth / but the nexte daye
as ſoone as their horſes were vnſhypped / they

rode towardes London. And all that ſeaſon
ſir Peter of Craon and ye bretons were ſtyll
with the erle. The mayre of London & they
that hadde the gouernyng of the cytie / were
the fyrſt that mette the erle in the feldes / and
humbly receyued him / and euer as they rode
forwarde they mette more people. The fyrſt
daye they cāe and laye at Guyldforde / a fyue
and twentie myle fro Lōdon. The next day
a great nombre of the men / women / and chyldren
of London and the clergy came to mete
with the erle / they had ſuche deſyre to ſe hym
And whan they cāe in to his ſight they cried
welcome noble erle of Derby & duke of Lancaſtre / 
God ſende you ioye / welthe / and proſperyte.
Sithe ye wente out of Englande / 
the realme hath ben in no proſperyte. Nowe
we truſte ye ſhall bringe vs in to a reaſonable
eſtate / for we haue lyued in great diſpleaſaunce
and deſolacyon / by the meanes of Richarde
of Burdeaux and his counſayle / and
ſpecially he ought mooſt chefe to be blamed.
For a kyng that ſhulde gouerne a Realme
and people / ought to haue ſuche diſcrecyon / 
to knowe gode and yuell aſondre / otherwiſe
he is nat worthy to gouerne a Realme. And
this Rycharde of Burdeaux hath done contrary / 
whiche ſhalbe well knowen and proued
vpon him. with ſuche wordes and other
the people brought the erle to London. The
mayre rode cheke and cheke by hym / whiche
was great pleaſure for the people to ſe / and
the mayre ſometyme ſayde to the erle. Sir / 
beholde howe the people reioyſe of your cō
               myng.
That is trewe quod the erle. And alwayes
as he rode he enclyned his heed to the
people on euery ſyde. Thus the Erle was
brought on his lodgynge / and euery man departed
tyll after dyner. Than the mayre and
the notable men of the cite / and dyuers other
lordes and knyghtes / prelates / byſſhoppes / 
and abbottes / ſuche as were in London cam
to ſe the the erle. Alſo the ducheſſe of Glouceſtre
and her two doughters came to ſe therle
who were his coſyn germayns. Affren their
brother was with kynge Richarde / more for
feare than̄e for loue. With theſe ladyes was
the counteſſe of Arundell and her chyldren / 
and alſo the counteſſe of Warwyke / with dyuers
other ladyes / ſuche as were at London
The people of London were ſo ioyfull of the
erles cōmyng / that there was no more workynge
in London that daye / than and it had
ben Eaſter daye.
            
               TO come to a concluſyon of this
buſyneſſe. The people toke coū
               ſayle
and aduyſe to ryde agaynſt
the kynge / whom the Londoners
named Richard of Burdeaux / 
kynge without tytell or
honour / for the vyllaynes of London hadde
the kyng in ſuche hate / that it was payne for
them to here ſpekynge of hym / but to his cō
               dempnacion
and diſtruction / for they hadde
treated the erle of Derby to be their kynge / 
and he was moche ordred by their counſayle
The erle of Derby toke on hym to be kyng / 
and ſo to endure for euer he and his heyres / 
and therto the Londoners dyde ſwere and
ſeale. And promyſed / that all the reſydue of
the realme ſhulde do the ſame / ſo ſolempnely
that there ſhulde neuer queſtyon be made
therof after. Alſo they promyſed hym to aide
and to aſſyſte hym alwayes. Theſe promyſes
and boundes ones taken and concluded / 
than it was ordayned that .xii. hundred men
of London well armed / ſhulde ryde with the
erle towardes Briſtowe / and to do ſo moche
that Richarde of Burdeaux myght be taken
and brought to London / and than to take aduyſe
what ſhulde be done with hym / and to
be iudged by the lawe / and by the thre eſtates
of the realme. Alſo it was ordayned (to
make the leſſe brute and ſclaundre) that the
men of warre of Bretaygne / ſuche as were
come thyder with the erle ſhulde be retourned
home agayne. For it was ſayde / howe
they hadde men ynoughe to do their dedes
without them / ſo that the erle had all the bretons
before hym / and thanked them of their
ſeruyce that they hadde done hym / and gaue
them great rewardes ſo that they were well
content / and ſo retourned to Plūmouthe to
the ſhyppes / and ſo in to Bretayne.
            ¶Nowe lette vs ſpeke of the erle of Derby
who ordayned to ryde to Briſtowe.
            
               THe erle of Derby was cheife of
that armye / as reaſon was / for it
touched hym moſt nereſt. Thus
he departed fro London / and as
he rode / the countrey fell in to hym. Tidynges
cāe in to the kynges hoſt / of the cōmyng

of the erle of Derby and of the Londoners / 
many knyghtes / ſquyers / and other knewe
it or the kynge hadde knowledge therof / but
they durſt nat ſpeke therof. Whan the tidynges
ſpredde more abrode / ſuche as were next
the kyng were in great feare. for they knewe
well the kynge and they bothe / were lykely
to fall in paryll / bycauſe they hadde ſo many
ennemyes in the realme. and ſuche were thā
their ennemyes / that hadde made good face
before. For many knightes / ſquyers / and other / 
ſuche as hadde ſerued the kyng before / 
departed fro the courte without any lycence.
Some wente home to their owne houſes / &
ſome toke the nexte waye they coude ſtreight
to the erle of Derby to ſerue hym. As ſoone
as Affren of Glouceſtre and Rycharde ſon̄e
to the erle of Arundell knewe that the Erle
of Derby and the Londoners were cōmynge / 
they gote their men toguyder and departed / 
and rode ſtreyght to the erle of Derby / 
whome they founde beyonde Oxenforde / at
a towne called Soucetour. Therle of Derby
hadde great ioye whan̄e he ſawe his coſyns / 
and demaunded of the ſtate of the kynge / 
and howe they were departed fro hym / 
They aunſwered and ſayde. Sir / at our departynge
we ſpake nat with hym. For as
ſoone as we knewe of your commynge / we
lepte on our horſes and departed to come to
ſerue you / and to ayde to reuenge the dethe
of our fathers / whome Richarde of Burdeaulx
hathe cauſed to be ſlayne. Sirs quod
the erle ye be ryght welcome / ye ſhall ayde
me and I ſhall helpe you. For it is behouable
that oure coſyn Rycharde of Burdeaux
be brought to London. ſo haue I promyſed
to the Londoners / and I wyll kepe my promyſe / 
for therto they wyll ayde me. And we
haue men ynowe to fyght with hym if nede
be. And if he wyll haue batayle he ſhall haue

ſome ſtronge caſtell tyll ſir Iohan Hollāde
your brother come / who is aduertyſed of all
this mater. And whan̄e he is come he ſhall
fynde ſome remedy / outher biforce of armes
or elles by treatie / at leeſt to bring you in to
ſome better caſe / than ye be in at this preſent
tyme. For if ye kepe the felde paraduenture
ſome wyll forſake you and go to hym. To
this coūſaile the kyng agreed. At that tyme
the erle of Saliſbury was nat with ye kyng
he was in his countre. Whan he herde howe
the erle of Derby with the Londoners and
great puiſſaunce rode agaynſt the kyng. He
ymagined that the matter was in paryll for
hym and for the kynge / and for ſuche as the
kyng had ben counſayled by: ſo he ſate ſtyll
to here other tidynges. Alſo the duke of yorke
was nat with the kyng / but his ſonne the
erle of Rutlande was alwayes with ye kyng
for two cauſes. The one was / kyng Richarde
loued hym entierly. And another was / bycauſe
he was conſtable of Englande / therfore
by right he ought to be with the kynge.
Whan the kyng had ſupped / newe tidynges
cāe agayne to hym / ſayeng. Sir / it is tyme
to take aduiſe howe ye wyll order your ſelfe

your puyſſaūce is nat ſufficient agaynſt thē
that cometh agaynſt you: It can nat aueyle
you to make batayle agaynſt them: It behoueth
you to paſſe this daunger / by ſadde
aduyſe and good counſayle. And by wyſedome
apeaſe them that be your yuel willers / 
as ye haue done or this tyme / and than correcte
them after at leyſar. There is a caſtell
a .xii. myle hens called the caſtell of Flynte / 
whiche is ſtronge. We counſayle you to go
thider and cloſe you within it / tyll ye here other
newes fro the erle of Huntyngton your
brother / and for other of your frendes / and
ſende in to Irelande for ſocours. And ye frē
               che
kyng your father in lawe whan he knoweth
of your nede / he wyll conforte you. the
kyng folowed that counſayle / and apoynted
them that ſhulde ride with hym to the caſtell
of Flynt. And he ordayned his coſyn erle of
Rutlande to tary ſtyll at Briſtowe / and that
they ſhulde be redy to ſette forwarde whan
he ſent to them / and that he was of power to
fyght with his enemyes. The nexte day the
kynge with ſuche as were of his houſholde
rode to the caſtell of Flynte / and entred in to
the caſtell without makynge any ſemblaunt
to make any warre / but to abide there and to
defende the caſtell if they were aſſayled.

            ¶Howe kyng Richarde yelded him
ſelfe to the erle of Derby to go to
London. Cap. CC.xli.
            
               THe erle of Derby & the
londoners had their ſpies
goyng and cōmyng / who
reported to them al ye ſtate
of the kyng. And alſo the
erle knewe it by ſuche knyghtes
and ſquyers as daylye
came fro the kynges parte to therle / who
had ſure knowledge that the king was gone
to the caſtell of Flynt / and had no company
with him / but ſuch as were of his owne houſholde / 
and ſemed that he wolde no warr̄ but
to ſcape that daūger by treatie. Than therle
determyned to ryde thyder / and to do ſo moche
to haue ye kyng outher biforce or by treatie.
Than the erle and all his company rode
thyder / and within two myle of the Caſtell
they founde a great vyllage / there the erle taryed
and dranke / & determyned in hym ſelfe
to ryde to the caſtell of Flynt with two hundred
horſe / and to leaue the reſt of his company
ſtyll there. And he ſayde he wolde do
what he coude by fayre treatie / to entre in to
the caſtell by loue and nat perforce. And to
bring out the kynge with fayre wordes / and
to aſſure hym fro all paryll / excepte goynge
to London / and to promiſe hym that he ſhall
haue no hurte of his body / and to be meane
for hym to the Londoners / who were nat cō
               tent
with hym. Therles deuyſe ſemed good
to them that harde it / and they ſayd to hym.
Sir / beware of diſſymulacion. This Rycharde
of Burdeaux muſte be taken outher
quycke or deed / and all the other traytours
that be about hym / and of his counſayle / and
ſo to be brought to London and ſette in the
towre / the Londoners wyll nat ſuffre you to
do the contrary: Than the erle ſayde. Sirs
feare nat / but all that is enterpriſed ſhall be
accomplyſſhed. But if I can gette hym out
of the caſtell with fayre wordes I wyll do it
and if I canne nat I ſhall ſende you worde
therof / and than ye ſhall come and laye ſiege
about the caſtell. And than we wyll do ſo moche
by force or by aſſaute / that we wyll haue
hym quicke or deed / for the caſtell is well prignable:
to thoſe wordes accorded well ye londoners.
So the erle departed fro the army
and rode with two hūdred men to the caſtell / 
where as the kyng was amōg his men right
ſore abaſſhed. The erle came ridyng to the
caſtell gate / whiche was faſte cloſed / as the
caſe requyred. The erle knocked at the gate
The porters demaūded who was there. the
erle anſwered / I am Henry of Lancaſtre. I
come to the kynge to demaunde myne herytage
of the duchy of Lancaſtre / ſhewe the
kynge this fro me. Sir quod they within / 
we ſhall do it. Incontynent they went in to
the hall and in to the 
                  •
               ongyon / where as the
kyng was / and ſuche knyghtes about hym / 
as had long tyme coūſayled hym. than theſe
newes were ſhewed to the kyng & ſayd. ſir / 
your coſyn of Derby is at ye gate / who demā
               deth
of you to be ſet in poſſeſſyon of ye duchy
of Lancaſtre his enherytaunce. The kynge

than regarded ſuche as were aboute hym / &
demaunded what was beſt to do. They ſaid
ſir / in this requeſt is none yuell / ye maye let
hym come in to you with .xii. perſons in his
company / and here what he wyll ſay. He is
your coſyn and a great lorde of the Realme:
He maye well make your peace and he wyll / 
for he is greatly beloued in the realme / and
ſpecially with the Londoners / who ſente for
hym in to Fraūce. They be as nowe ye chefe
that be agaynſt you. Sir / ye muſt diſſymule
tyll the mater be apeaſed / and tyll the erle of
Huntyngton your brother be with you. And
it cometh nowe yuell to paſſe for you / that he
is at Calais. For there be many nowe in Englande
that be ryſen agaynſt you / that and
they knewe that youre brother were aboute
you / they wolde ſytte ſtyll and durſt nat diſpleaſe
you / and yet he hathe to his wyfe the
erle of Derbyes ſuſter: by his meanes we
ſuppoſe ye ſhulde come to peace and cōcorde
The kyng agreed to thoſe wordes and ſaid.
Go and let hym come in with .xii. with hym
and no mo. Two knyghtes went downe to
the gate / and opyned the wycket and iſſued
out and made reuerence to the erle / and receyued
hym with gracious wordes / for they
knewe well that they hadde no force to reſyſt
them / and alſo they knewe well the Londoners
were ſore diſpleaſed with thē / therfore
they ſpake fayre / and ſayde to the erle. Sir / 
what is your pleaſure / the kyng is at maſſe / 
he hath ſente vs hyder to ſpeke with you? I
ſaye quod therle / ye knowe well I ought to
haue poſſeſſyon of the ouchy of Lancaſtre / 
I am come in partie for that cauſe / and alſo
for other thynges that I wolde ſpeke with
the kynge of. Sir quod they ye be welcome / 
the kyng wolde be gladde to ſe you & to here
you / and hath commaunded that ye come to
hym all onely with .xii. perſones. The erle
anſwered / it pleaſeth me well. So he entred
in to the caſtell with .xii. perſones / and than
the gate cloſed agayne and the reſt of his cō
               pany
taryed without.
            NOwe conſyder what daūger therle
of Derby was in / for the kyng than
myght haue ſlayne hym / and ſuche
as were with hym / as eaſely as a byrde in a
cage. But he feared nat the mater / but boldelye
went to the kyng / who chaūged colours
whan he ſawe the erle. Than the erle ſpake
aloude without makynge of any great honour
or reuerence / and ſayd. Sir / are ye faſtynge?
The kyng anſwered and ſayd yea / 
why aſke you. It is tyme quod the erle that
ye had dyned / for ye haue a great iourney to
ryde. Why / wheder ſhulde I ryde quod the
kynge? ye muſt ryde to London quod therle
wherfore I counſayle you eate and drinke / 
that ye maye ryde with the more myrthe.
Than the kynge who was ſore troubled in
his mynde / and in a maner afrayde of thoſe
wordes ſayde. I am nat hungry / I haue no
luſte to eate. Than ſuche as wereby / who
were as than gladde to flatter therle of Derby / 
for they ſawe well the mater was lyke to
go dyuerſly / ſayde to the kynge. Sir / beleue
your coſyn of Lancaſtre for he wyll nothyng
but good. Than the kyng ſayd well / 
I am content couer the tables. Thanne the
kynge waſſhed and ſatte downe / and was
ſerued. Than the erle was demaunded if he
wolde ſytte downe / he ſayde no / for he was
nat faſtynge.
            IN the mean ſeaſon whyle the kyng
ſatte at dyner / who dyde eate but lytell / 
his hert was ſo full that he had
no luſt to eate. All the countrey about the caſtell
was full of men of warre. They within
the caſtell myght ſe them out at the wyndowes / 
and the kynge whan he roſe fro the
table myght ſe them hym ſelfe. Than he demaunded
of his coſyn what men they were / 
that appered ſo many in the feldes. Therle
aunſwered and ſayde / the mooſt parte of thē
be Londoners. What wolde they haue quod
the kyng? They wyll haue you quod therle / 
and bringe you to London and putte you in
to the towre / there is none other remedy / ye
can ſcape none otherwyſe. No quod ye kyng
and he was ſore afrayde of thoſe wordes / for
he knewe well the Lōdoners loued hym nat
and ſayde. Coſyn / can you nat prouyde for
my ſuretie: I wyll nat gladly putte me in to
their hādes. For I knowe well they hate me
and haue done long / though I be their kynge.
Than therle ſayd. Sir / I ſe none other
remedy but to yelde your ſelfe as my priſoner:
and whan they knowe that ye be my priſoner
they wyll do you no hurte / but ye muſt
ſo ordayne you & your cōpany to ryde to Lō
               don

with me / and to be as my priſoner in the
towre of London. The kyng who ſawe hym
ſelf in a harde caſe / all his ſpyrites were ſore
abaſſhed / as he that douted greatly that the
londoners wolde ſlee hym. Than he yelded
hym ſelfe priſoner to the erle of Derby and
boūde hym ſelfe / and promyſed to do all that
he wolde haue hym to do. In lykewiſe all other
knightes / lquyers / and offycers yelded
to the erle / to eſchewe the daūger and paryll
that they were in / and the erle than receyued
them as his priſoners / and ordayned incontynent
horſes to be ſadylled & brought forthe
in to the courte & the gates opyned / than many
men of armes & archers entred. Than the
erle of Derby cauſed a crye to be made / on
payne of dethe / no man to be ſo hardy to take
away any thyng within ye caſtell / nor to laye
any handes vpon any ꝑſone / for all were vnder
the erles ſauegarde and protection: whiche
crye was kept no man durſt breke it. the
erle had the kyng downe in to the courte talkyng
toguyder / & cauſed all the kynges hole
houſholde and eſtate to go forwarde / as of
cuſtome they had done before / without chaū
               gyng
or myniſſhynge of any thyng. Whyle
euery thyng was a preparyng / the kyng and
the erle cōmuned toguyder in the court / and
were well regarded by the Londoners. And
as it was entormed me / kynge Richarde had
a grayhounde called Mathe / who alwayes
wayted vpon the kynge / and wolde knowe
no man els. For whan ſoeuer the kyng dyde
ryde / he that kept the grayhounde dyde lette
hym loſe / and he wolde ſtreight rynne to the
kynge and fawne vpon hym / and leape with
his tore fete vpon the kynges ſhulders. And
as the kyng & the erle of Derby talked togyder
in the courte / the grayhounde who was
wont to lepe vpon the kyng / left the kynge &
came to the erle of Derby duke of Lancaſtre
and made to hym the ſame frendly coūtinaū
               ce
& chere / as he was wonte to do to the kyng
The duke who knewe nat the grayhoūde demaunded
of the kyng what the grayhounde
wolde do. Coſyn quod the kyng / it is a gret
good token to you / and an yuell ſigne to me.
Sir / howe knowe you that quod the duke?
I knowe it well quod the kyng. The grayhounde
maketh you chere this day as kynge
of Englande / as ye ſhalbe / and I ſhalbe depoſed:
the grayhoūde hath this knowledge
naturally / therfore take hym to you / he wyll
folowe you & forſake me. The duke vnderſtode
well thoſe wordes and cheriſſhed the
grayhounde / who wolde neuer after folowe
kyng Richarde / but folowed the duke of Lā
               caſtre.
            SO euery man lepte a horſbacke and
departed fro the caſtell of Flynt / &
entred in to the feldes. Thus duke
Henry of Lancaſtre / who was no more called
erle of Derby but duke of Lācaſtre / rode
by the kyng and oftentymes talked togider / 
and men of warre before & behynde in great
nombre / and all ſuche as were of the kynges
courte / rode toguyder in a company. That
night they laye about Oxenforde. The duke
of Lancaſtre ledde kyng Richarde by no caſtelles
nor good townes / for feare of ſtyring
of the people / but alwayes kepte the feldes.
Than the duke gaue lycence to a great nombre
of his people to departe and ſayd. Sirs
ye maye departe for we haue that we deſyre.
the kynge can nat flye nor ſcape fro vs / we &
our owne company ſhall bring hym to London / 
and putte hym in ſauegarde in ye towre
he and all his are my priſoners / I may bringe
them whider I wyll. Therfore ſirs / go
your wayes home tyll ye here other newes.
They dyde as the duke cōmaunded thē / who
toke the way to Wyndſore / and came thyder / 
and mooſt parte of the Lōdoners retourned
to London / & other to their owne places. the
duke of Lācaſtre deꝑted fro wynſore / & wolde
nat ride by Colbroke / but toke the way by
Shene / & ſo cāe to dyner to Cherſay. ye king
had deſyred the duke that he ſhulde nat bringe
hym London waye / nor through the cytie
and therfore they tooke that waye. As ſoone
as they had the kynge thus in their handes / 
they ſente notable ꝑſones to the yong quene / 
who was at Ledes in Kent. And they cāe to
the lady Coucy / who was ſeconde perſone
there next to the quene / and ſayd to her. Madame / 
make you redy for ye muſt deꝑte hens
and at your departyng make no ſemblant of
diſpleaſure before the quene / but ſaye howe
your huſbande hath ſent for you / & for your
doughter alſo. This that we ſaye / loke that
you do accomplyſſhe on payne of your lyfe / 
nor axe ye no queſtyons no further. And ye
ſhalbe conueyed to Douer / and there haue a

ſhyppe that ſhall bring you to Boloyne. the
lady who douted thoſe wordꝭ / for ſhe knewe
well Englyſſhemen were cruell and haſty / 
ſaid. ſirs / as god wyll I am redy to do as ye
wyll haue me. Anone ſhe made her redy and
horſes were prouyded for her and for her cō
               pany.
So all Frenche men and women departed / 
and they were conueyed to Douer / &
at the next tyde they toke ſhippyng and had
good wynde / and ſo arryued at Boloyne.

            ¶Of the ſtate of quene Iſabell of englande / 
and howe ſhe had all newe
ꝑſones apoynted to wayte vpon her
and howe kyng Richarde was ſette
in the towre of London.
Capi. CC.xlii.
            
               AS for the ſtate of the
quene was ſo tourned and
broken / for there was lefte
nouther man / womon / nor
chylde of ye nacion of Frā
               ce / 
nor yet of Englande / ſuche
as were in any fauour
with the kyng / Her. houſe was newly furniſſhed
with ladyes and damoſelles / and other
offycers and ſeruauntes. They were charged
all / that in no wyſe they ſhuld nat ſpeke
of the kynge / nat one to another. Thus the
duke of Lācaſtre departed fro Cheriſay and
rode to Shene / and fro thens in the nyght
tyme they conueyed the kyng to the towre of
London / and ſuche other knightes and ſquyers
as the kyng wolde. The nexte mornyng
whan the Londoners knewe that the kynge
was in the towre / they were gretly reioyſed
but there was great murmuring among thē
bycauſe the kyng was conueyed thyder ſo ſecretely.
They were angry that the duke had
nat brought hym throughe London openly / 
nat to haue done him honor / but ſhame / they
hated hym ſo ſore. Beholde the opinyon of
cōmon people / whā they be vp agaynſt their
prince or lorde / and ſpecially in Englande. amonge
them there is no remedy / for they are
the perylouſt people of the worlde / and moſt
outragyouſt if they be vp / and ſpecially the
Londoners / and in dede they be riche and of
a great nombre. There was well in Lōdon
a.xxiiii. thouſāde men in harneſſe complete / 
and a.xxx. thouſande archers / and they were
hardy & hygh of corage / the more blode they
ſawe ſhedde / the leſſe they were abaſſhed.
            ¶Nowe lette vs ſomwhat ſpeke of the erle
of Rutlande conſtable of Englande / ſonne
to the duke of yorke / who was taryed at Briſtowe
and the lorde Spēſer with hym / who
had his ſuſter to wyfe. Whan they knewe yt
the caſtell of Flynte was gyuen vp / and the
kynge taken and brought to London / than̄e
they thought ſurely / the matters wente nat
well for the kynge. Therfore they thought
no lengar to tary there / and gaue leaue to al
their men of warre to departe / and the erle
of Rutlande and the lorde Spenſer rode toguyder
with their owne ſeruauntes to Hull
in the marcheſſe of Wales / a fayre māner of
the lorde Spenſers / & there they taryed tyll
they herde other tidynges. And the duke of
yorke laye ſtyll in his caſtell / & medled with
nothynge of the buſyneſſe of Englande / no
more he dyde before / he toke euer the tyme aworthe
as it came. howbeit he was ſore diſpleaſed
in his mynde / to ſe ſuche difference
within ye realme / and bytwene his nephues
and blode. ¶Nowe let vs retourne to ſpeke
of kynge Richarde.
            WHan the duke of Lancaſtre had ſet
his coſyn kyng Richard in ye towre
of London / and certayne of his coū
               ſaylours / 
and had ſette ſure kepynge on thē.
The fyrſt thyng than that the duke / he
ſent for the erle of Warwyke / who was banyſſhed
and cōmaunded to lye in the yſle of
Wyght / and diſcharged hym clene therof. &
ſecondly the duke of Lancaſtre ſent to therle
of Northumberlande and to the lorde Percy
his ſonne / that they ſhulde come to hym / and
ſo they dyde. After he enquered and ſought
out to haue the foure companyons that had
ſtrangled his vncle the duke of Glouceſtre
in the caſtell of Calais. They were ſo well
ſought out / that they were all taken: They
were ſette in priſone aparte in Lōdon. than
the duke of Lancaſtre and his coūſayle toke
aduyſe what ſhulde be done with kyng Richarde
beyng in the towre of Lōdon / where
as kyng Iohan of Fraunce was kept / whyle

kynge Edwarde wente in to the Realme of
Fraūce. Than it was thought that king Rycharde
ſhuld be put fro all his royalte and ioy
that he hath lyued in / for they ſayd / the newes
of his takynge ſhulde ſprede abrode in to all
realmes cryſtened. He had been kynge .xxii.
yere / and as than they determined to kepe him
in priſone. Than they regarded what caſe the
realme ſtode in / and dyd put all his dedes in
artycles to the nombre of .xxviii. Than the duke
of Lancaſtre and his counſayle went to the
towre of London / and entred in to the chambre
where kynge Rycharde was / and without
any reuerence makynge to hym / there was openly
redde all the ſaid artycles / to the whiche
the kynge made none aunſwere / for he ſawe
well all was true yt was layde to his charge / 
ſauynge he ſayd / all that I haue doone paſſed
by my counſayle. Than he was demaunded
what they were that had gyuen coūſayle / and
by whome he was moſt ruled / he named them
in truſt therby to haue ben delyuered himſelfe
in accuſynge of them / as he had doone before
tyme / truſtynge therby to ſcape / and to bringe
them in the daunger and payne / but that was
nat the mynde of them that loued hym nat. ſo
as at that tyme they ſpake no more but departed / 
and the duke of Lancaſtre went to his lodgynge / 
and ſuffred the mayre and the men of
lawe to procede. They went to ye Guyldhall / 
where as all the maters of the cytie were determyned / 
and than moche people aſſēbled there.
Whan they ſawe the gouernours of the cytie
go thyder / they thought ſome iuſtice ſhulde be
done / as there was in dede. I ſhall ſhewe you
howe. Fyrſte the artycles that were made agaynſt
the kynge / the whiche had been redde
before hym in the towre / were redde agayne
there openly. And it was ſhewed by hym that
redde them / howe the kynge hymſelfe denyed
none of them / but confeſſed that he dyd theym
by the counſayle of four knightes of his chambre / 
and howe by their counſayle he had put
to dethe the duke of Glouceſtre and the erle of
Arūdell / ſir Thomas Corbet / and other / and
howe they had longe encyted the kynge to do
thoſe dedes / whiche dedes they ſayd were nat
to be forgyuen / but demaunded punycion / for
by them and their coūſayle the iuſtyce of right
was cloſed vp through all the courtes of Englande / 
Weſtmynſter / and other / wherby many
yuell dedes folowed / and companyes and
rowtes of theues and murderers roſe and aſſembled
togyther in dyuers parties of the realme / 
and robbed marchauntes by the wayes
and poore men in their houſes / by whiche meanes
the realme was in great parell to haue ben
loſt / without recouery. and it is to be ymagyned
that fynally the wolde haue rendred Calais
or Guyſnes / or bothe in to the frenchmennes
handes. Theſe wordes thus ſhewed to the
people made many to be abaſſhed / and many
beganne to murmure and ſayd. Theſe cauſes
demaunde punycion / that all other may take
enſample therby / and Rycharde of Burdeaur
to be depoſed / for he is nat worthy to beare a
crowne / but ought to be depriued fro all honour / 
and to be kept all his lyfe in priſon with
breed and water. Though ſome of the villaynes
murmured / other ſaid on hygh. ſir mayre
of London / and ye other that haue iuſtyce in
your handes to mynyſter / execute iuſtyce / for
we wyll ye ſpare no man / for ye ſe well the caſe
that ye haue ſhewed vs demaūdeth iuſtyce in
cōtynent / for they are iudges vpon their owne
dedes. Than the mayre and other of the gouernours
of the lawe went togyther in to the
chambre of iudgement. than theſe four knyghtes
were iudged to dye / and were iudged to be
had to the foote of the towre where as kynge
Richarde was / that he might ſe them drawen
alonge by the dyke with horſes eche after other / 
throughe the cytie in to chepeſyde / and
than there heedes ſtryken of there / and ſette
vpon London bridge / and there bodyes drawen
to the gybet and there hanged.
            THis iudgement gyuen they were delyuered
to execucyon / for the mayre
of London and ſuche as were deputed
to the mater / wente fro the Guyldhall to
the towre / and toke out the four knyghtes of
the kynges / whoſe names were called ſir Bernarde
Brokas / ſyr Marelays / mayſter Iohn̄
Derby receyuour of Lyncolne / and mayſter
Stell the kynges ſtewarde. Eche of thē were
tyed to two horſes / in the preſence of them that
were in the towre / and the kynge myght well
ſe it out at the wyndowes / wherwith he was
ſore deſcomforted / for all other that were there
with the kynge loked to be in the ſame caſe / 
they knewe them of London ſo cruell. Thus
theſe four knyghtes were drawen one after another
a longe through the cyte tyll they came

in to chepe / and there on a fyſſhers ſtall their
heedes were ſtryken of and ſet vpon London
bridge / and their bodyes drawen by the ſhulders
to the gybet / and there hanged vp. This
iuſtyce thus doone / euery man went to their
lodgynges. Kynge Rycharde knowyng him
ſelfe taken / and in the daunger of the londoners
was in great ſorowe in his herte / and rekened
his puyſſaunce nothynge / for he ſawe
howe euery man was agaynſte hym. and if
there were any that ought hym any fauour / it
laye nat than in their powers to do hym any
ayde / nor they durſte nat ſhewe it. Suche as
were with the kynge ſayde. Syr / we haue but
ſmall truſt in our lyues as it may well apere / 
for whan your coſyn of Lancaſtre came to the
caſtell of Flynte / and with your owne good
wyll ye yelded you to hym / and he promyſed
that you and twelue of yours ſhuld be his priſoners
and haue no hurte / and nowe of thoſe
twelue four be executed ſhamfully / we are like
to paſſe the ſame way. The cauſe is / theſe londoners / 
who hath cauſed the duke of Lancaſtre
your coſyn to do this dede / had hym ſo
ſore bounde to them that he muſte do as they
wyll haue hym. God dothe moche for vs / if he
ſuffre that we myght dye here our naturall
deth / and nat a ſhamfull dethe. It is great pytie
to thynke on this. With thoſe wordes kyng
Rycharde began tēderly to wepe and wringe
his handes / and curſed the houre that euer he
was borne / rather than to haue ſuche an ende.
Suche as were aboute hym had great pytie
and recomforted hym as well as they might.
One of his knyghtes ſayd. Syr / it behoueth
you to take comforte / we ſe well and ſo do you
that this worlde is nothyng / the fortunes ther
of are marueylous / and ſomtyme tourne as
well vpon kinges and princes / as vpon poore
men. The frenche kynge whoſe doughter ye
haue maryed / canne nat nowe ayde you / he is
to farre of. if ye myght ſcape this myſchefe by
dyſſimulacyon and ſaue your lyfe and ours / 
it were a good enterpriſe / peraduenture with
in a yere or two / there wolde be had ſome recouery.
Why ꝙ the kynge / what wolde ye that
I ſhulde do / there is nothynge but I wolde
be glad to do it / to ſaue vs therby? Syr quod
the knyght / we ſe for trouthe that theſe londoners
wyll crowne your coſyn of Lancaſtre as
kynge / and for that entent they ſent for hym / 
and ſo haue ayded hym and do / it is nat poſſyble
for you to lyue without ye conſent that
he be crowned kynge / wherfore ſyr / we wyll
counſayle you (to the entent to ſaue your lyfe
and ours) that whan your coſyn of Lancaſtre
cōmeth to you to demaunde any thynge / than
with ſwete and treatable wordes ſay to hym / 
howe that ye wyll reſygne to hym the crowne
of Englande / and all the ryght that ye haue in
the realme / clerely and purely in to his handes / 
and howe that ye wyll that he be kynge / 
therby ye ſhall greatly apeaſe him and the londoners
alſo / and deſyre hym effectuouſly to
ſuffre you to lyue and vs alſo with you / or els
euery man a parte / as it ſhall pleaſe him / or els
to baniſſhe vs out of the realme for euer / for he
that leſeth his lyfe leſeth all. Kynge Rycharde
herde thoſe wordes well / and fyxed them ſurelye
in his herte / and ſayd he wolde do as they
counſayled hym / as he that ſawe hym ſelfe in
great daunger. and than he ſayd to them that
kepte hym / howe he wolde gladly ſpeke with
his coſyn of Lancaſtre.

            ¶Howe Kynge Rycharde of Englande
reſigned the crowne and the
realme in to the handes of the erle of
Derby duke of Lancaſtre.
Cap. CC.xliiii.
            
               IT was ſhewed the duke
of Lancaſtre howe Rycharde
of Burdeaux deſyred to ſpeke
with hym. The duke in an euenynge
toke a barge and went
to the towre by water / & went
to the kynge / who receyued hym curteſly / and
humbled hym ſelfe greatly / as he that ſawe
hym ſelfe in great daunger / and ſayd. Coſyn
of Lancaſtre / I regarde and conſydre myne
eſtate / whiche is as nowe but ſmall / I thanke
god therof. As any more to reygne or to gouerne
people / or to beare a crowne / I thynke
it nat / and as god helpe me I wolde I were
deed by a naturall dethe / and that the frenche
kinge had agayne his doughter / we haue had
as yet no gret ioy togyder / nor ſyth I brought
her in to Englande / I coulde neuer haue the
loue of my people as I had before. Coſyn all

thynges cōſydred / I knowe we well I haue greatly
treſpaſſed agaynſt you / and agaynſt other
noble men of my blodde / by dyuers thynges / 
I perceyue I ſhall neuer haue pardone nor
come to peace / wherfore with myne owne free
and lyberall wyll / I wyll reſygne to you the
herytage of the Crowne of Englande / and I
requyre you take the gyfte therof with the reſignacyon.
Whan the duke herde that he ſayd.
ſyr it is conuenyent that parte of the thre eſtates
of the realme be called to theſe wordes / and
I haue ſent all redy for ſome noble men / prelates / 
and counſaylours of the good townes
of Englande / and I truſte they wyll be here
within this thre dayes ſuffycient of them / for
you to make a dewe reſygnacion before them / 
and by this meanes ye ſhal greatly apeaſe many
men within the realme. For to withſtande
ſuche enormyties and yuels as haue ben vſed
in the realme for faute of iuſtyce / who had no
place to reygne / I was ſent for fro beyond the
ſee / and the people wolde crowne me / for the
renome rynneth through Englande / that I
haue more ryght to the crowne than ye haue / 
for whan our grauntfather kynge Edwarde
the thyrde dyd choſe and make you kynge / the
ſame was as than ſhewed hym / but he loued
ſo his ſonne the prince / that none coude breake
his purpoſe nor opinyon / but that you ſhulde
be kynge / and if ye wolde haue folowed the
ſteppes of your father the prince / and haue beleued
his counſayle / as a good ſonne ought to
haue done / ye myght haue ben ſtyll kyng / and
haue contynued youre eſtate / but ye haue alwayes
done the contrary / ſo that the cōmon renome
rynneth through England and in other
places / that ye were neuer ſonne to the prince
of Wales / but rather ſonne to a preeſt or to a
chanon / for I haue herde of certayne knightes
that were in the Princes howſe myne vncle / 
howe that he knew well that his wyfe had nat
truely kepte her maryage. your mother was
coſyn germayne to kynge Edwarde / and the
kynge beganne to hate her / bycauſe ſhe coulde
haue no generacion. Alſo ſhe was the kynges
goſſyp of two chyldren at the fonte. And ſhe
that coulde well kepe the prince in her bandon
by crafte and ſubtylte / ſhe made the prince to
be her huſbande / and bycauſe ſhe coulde haue
no chylde / ſhe douted that the prince ſhulde be
deuorſed fro her. ſhe dyd ſo moch that ſhe was
with chylde with you / and with another before
you / as of the fyrſt I can nat tell what to
iudge / but as for you bycauſe your cōdicyons
haue ben ſene contrary fro all nobles and prowes
of the prince / therfore it is ſayd that ye be
rather ſonne to a preſt or to a chanon. for whan
ye were gotten and borne at Burdeaux / there
were many yonge preeſtes in ye princes houſe.
This is the brute in this countrey / and your
workes haue well folowed the ſame / for ye be
alwayes enclyned to the pleaſure of the french
men / and to take with them peace to the confuſyon
and dy ſhonoure of the realme of Englande.
And bycauſe myne vncle of Glouceſtre
and the erle of Arundell dyd coūſayle you
truly and faythfully / to kepe the honour of the
realme / and to folowe the ſteppes of your aunceſtours / 
ye haue traytourſly cauſed them to
dye. As for me I haue taken on me to defende
your lyfe as longe as I may for pytie / and I
ſhall pray the londoners and the herytours of
them that ye haue ſlayne and banyſſhed / to do
the ſame. Coſyn I thanke you quod yt kynge.
I truſte more in you than in any other. It is
but ryght that ye ſo ſhulde do / for if I had nat
ben / ye had ben taken by the people and depoſed
with great confuſyon and ſlayne / by reaſone
of your yuell workes. Kynge Rycharde
herde well all the dukes wordes / and wyſt nat
what to ſaye agaynſt it / for he ſawe well that
force nor argumentes coulde nat auelyle him / 
but rather mekeneſſe and humilyte / wherfore
he humbled hym / and prayed the duke to ſaue
his lyfe.
            WHan the duke of Lancaſtre had ben
at the towre two houres with kynge
Rycharde / & had ſhewed hym parte
of his fautes / than he retourned. And the next
day he ſent forthe mo cōmaundementes in to
all parties of the realme / to cauſe noble men
and other to come to London. His vncle the
duke of yorke came to London and the erle of
Rutlande his ſonne / the erle of Northumberlande
and the lorde Thomas Percy his brother.
The duke of Lancaſtre made them good
chere. Thyder came alſo great nombre of prelates
and abbottes. And on a day the duke of
Lancaſtre acompanyed with lordes / dukes / 
prelates / erles / barones / and knyghtes / and of
the notableſt men of London & of other good
townes / rode to the Towre and there alyghted.
Than kynge Rycharde was brought in

to the hall / aparelled lyke a kynge in his robes
of eſtate / his ſepter in his hande / and his
crowne on his heed. Than he ſtode vp alone / 
nat holden nor ſtayed by no man / and ſayde a
loude. I haue been kynge of Englande / duke
of Acquytany / and lorde of Irelande aboute
xxii. yeres / whiche ſygnory / royalte / cepter / 
crowne / and herytage / I clerely reſygne here
to my coſyn Henry of Lancaſtre / and I deſyre
hym here in this open preſence in entrynge of
the ſame poſſeſſyon / to take this ſeptour / and
ſo delyuered it to the duke / who toke it. Than
kynge Rycharde toke the crowne fro his heed
with bothe his handes / and ſet it before hym / 
and ſayd. Fayre coſyn Henry duke of Lancaſtre / 
I gyue & delyuer you this crowne / wherwith
I was crowned kyng of Englande / and
therwith / all the right therto dependyng. The
duke of Lancaſtre tooke it / and the archebyſſhop
of Caunterbury toke it out of the dukes
handes. this reſygnacion thus done the duke
of Lancaſtre called a notary / and demaunded
to haue letters and wytneſſe of all the prelates
and lordes there beynge preſent. Than Rycharde
of Burdeaux retourned agayne in to
the chambre fro whence he came. Than the
duke of Lancaſtre and all other lept on their
horſes / and the crowne and ceptour were put
in a cofer / and conueyed to the abbey of Weſtmynſter / 
and there kept in the treaſory. And
euery man wente to their lodgynges / and abode
tyll the day of parliament and counſayle
ſhulde be at the palays of Weſtmynſter.
         
         
            ¶Of the coronacyon of kyng Henry
duke of Lancaſtre / by the conſent of
the realme / & the maner of the feeſt.
Cap. CC.xlv.
            
               IN the yere of our lorde
god a thouſande thre hundred
fourſcore & nynetene / 
the laſt daye of ſeptembre / 
on a tuyſday began a parlyament
at Weſtmynſter / 
holden by Henry duke of
Lancaſtre / at whiche tyme there was aſſembled
prelates and clergy of the realme of Englande
a great nombre / and alſo dukes / erles / 
and barones / and of euery towne a certayne.
Thus the people aſſembled at Weſtmynſter / 
there beynge preſente the duke of Lancaſtre:
and there the ſame duke chalenged the realme
of Englande / and deſyred to be kynge by thre
reaſones. Fyrſt by conqueſt. ſecondly bycauſe
he was heyre. And thyrdly bycauſe Rycharde
of Burdeaur had reſygned the Realme in to
his handes by his free wyll / in the preſence of
certayne dukes / erles / prelates / and barones
in the hall within the towre of London. Theſe
thre cauſes ſhewed / the duke of Lancaſtre requyred
all the people there preſent / as well one
as other / to ſhewe their myndes and ententes
in that behalfe. Than all the people with one
voyce ſayd / that their wylles was to haue him
kynge / and howe they wolde haue none other
but hym. Than the duke agayne ſayd to the
people. Sirs / is this your myndes. and they
all with one voyce ſayde / ye / ye. And than the
duke ſate downe in the ſyege royall / whiche
ſeate was reyſed vp in the hall / and couered
with a clothe of eſtate / ſo yt euery man myght
well ſe hym ſytte. And than the people lyfted
vp their handes a hygh / promyſing hym their
faythe and allegyaunce. Thanne the parlyament
cōcluded / and the day was taken for his
coronacyon of ſaynt Edwardes day / the monday
the .xiii. day of Octobre / at whiche tyme / 
the ſaturday before his coronacyon he departed
fro Weſtmynſter and rode to the towre of
London with a great nombre. and that night
all ſuche ſquyers as ſhulde be made knyghtes
the nexte day / watched / who were to the nombre
of .xlvi. Euery ſquier had his owne bayne
by him ſelfe / and the next day the duke of Lancaſtre
made theym all knyghtes at the maſſe
tyme. Than had they longe cotes with ſtrayte
ſleues furred wt mynyuer lyke prelates / with
whyte laces hangynge on their ſhuldes. And
after dyner the duke departed fro the towre to
Weſtmynſter / & rode all the way bareheeded / 
and aboute his necke the lyuery of Fraunce.
He was acompanyed with ye prince his ſonne
and ſyxe dukes / ſyxe erles / and .xviii. barons / 
and in all knyghtes and ſquyers a nyne hundred
horſe. Than the kynge had on a ſhorte
cote of clothe of golde / after the maner of Almayne / 
and he was mounted on a whyte cou
                  •
               
               ſer / 
and the garter on his left legge. Thus the
duke rode through London with a great nombre
of lordes / euery lordes ſeruaunt in their
mayſters lyuery. All the but geſſes & lombardes

marchauntes in London / and euery craft
with their lyuerey and deuyſe. Thus he was
conueyed to Weſtmynſter. He was in nombre
a ſyxe thouſāde horſe / and the ſtreates hanged
as he paſſed by. and the ſame day and the next
there were in London rynnynge ſeuen cundyttes
with wyne whyte and reed. That nyght
the duke was bayned / and the next mornynge
he was confeſſed / and herde thre maſſes as he
was acuſtomed to do / and than all the prelates
and clergy came fro Weſtmynſter churche to
the palays to fetche the kynge with proceſſion
and ſo he went to the churche a proceſſion / and
all the lordes with hym in their robes of ſcarlet / 
furred with menyuer / barred of their ſhulders
acordynge to their degrees / and ouer the
kynge was borne a clothe of eſtate of blewe / 
with four belles of golde / and it was borne by
four burgeſſes of the portes / as Douer and other.
And on euery ſyde of him he had a ſword
borne / the one ye ſworde of the churche / and the
other the ſworde of iuſtyce. The ſworde of the
church his ſonne the prince dyd beare / and the
ſworde of iuſtyce therle of Northumberlande
dyd beare / for he was as than conſtable of Englande / 
for the erle of Rutlande was depoſed
fro that offyce / and the erle of Weſtmerlande
who was marſhall of Englande / bare the ceptour.
Thus they entred in to ye churche about
nyne of the clocke / and in the myddes of the
churche there was an hygh ſcaffolde all couered
with reed / and in the myddes therof there
was a chayre Royall / couered with clothe of
golde. Than the kyng ſate downe in yt chayre
and ſo ſate in eſtate royall / ſauynge he had nat
on the crowne / but ſate bare heeded. Than at
four corners of the ſcaff olde / the archebyſſhop
of Caunterbury ſhewed vnto the people howe
god had ſent them a man to be their kyng / and
demaunded if they were content that he ſhulde
be conſecrated and crowned as their kynge.
And they all with one voyce ſayd yea / & helde
vp their handes / promyſynge him faythe and
obeyſaunce. Than the kynge roſe and wente
downe the ſcaffolde to the hygh auter to be ſacred / 
at whiche conſecracyon there were two
archbyſſhoppes and ten byſſhops / and before
the aulter the
                  •
                he was diſpoyled out of all his
veſtures of eſtate / & there he was anoynted in
vi. places / on the heed / on the breſt & on the two
ſhulders behynde / and on the handes. Than a
bonet was ſer on his heed / and whyle he was
anoyntynge the clergy ſange the latyny / and
ſuche ſeruyce as they ſynge at the halowing of
the fonte. Than yt kinge was aparelled lyke a
prelate of the churche▪ with a cope of reed ſylke
and a payre of ſpurres with a poynte without
a rowell. Than the ſworde of iuſtyce was drawen
out of the ſhethe and halowed / and than
it was taken to ye kyng / who dyd put it agayne
in to the ſheth / than the archebyſſhop of Caunterbury
dyd gyrde ye ſworde about hym. than
ſaynt Edwardes crowne was brought forthe
whiche is cloſe aboue and bleſſed / and than the
archebyſſhop dyd ſette it on the kynges heed.
After maſſe the kyng departed out of the churche
in the ſame eſtate and went to his palays / 
and there was a fountayne that ranne by dyuers
braunches whyte wyne and reed. Than
the kyng entred in to the hall / and ſo in to a priuy
chamber / and after came out agayne to dyner.
At the fyrſt table ſate the kynge. At the ſeconde
ye fyue peres of the realme / at the thyrde
the valaunt men of London. at the fourth the
newe made knightes. At the fyft the knyghtes
and ſquiers of honour. And by the kyng ſtode
the prince holdynge the ſworde of the churche / 
and on the other ſyde the Conſtable with the
ſworde of iuſtyce / and a lytell aboue the marſhall
with the ceptour / and at yt kynges borde
ſate two archbyſſhops and .xvii. byſſhoppes.
And in the myddes of the dyner there came in
a knight / who was called Dinereth all armed
vpon a good horſe rychely aparelled / and had
a knyght before hym bearyng his ſpeare / and
his ſworde by his ſyde and his dagger. The
knyght toke the kyng a lybell / the whiche was
red. Therin was conteyned that there were
outher knight / ſquyer / or any other gētylman
that wold ſay that kyng Henry was nat right
full kyng / he was there redy to fyght with him
in that quarell / before the kynge / or where as
it ſhulde pleaſe hym to apoynte. that byll was
cryed by an haraulde in ſyxe places of the hall
and in the towne. There was none that wolde
chalenge hym. Whan the kynge had dyned he
toke wyne & ſpyces in the hall / and than went
in to his chambre. Than euery man departed
and went to their lodginges. thus the day paſſed
of kynge Henryes coronacyon with great
ioy and feeſt / whiche endured all the next day.
The erle of Salyſbury was nat at this ſolēpnyte
for he was in ſure priſon / and the kinges
coūſayle and dyuers other noble men / and the

londoners / wolde that his heed ſhulde haue
ben ſtryken of openly in chepe / for ſaid he
had well deſerued it / for bearynge of letters
and credēce fro Rycharde of Burdeaux to the
frenche kyng / and there to reporte openly that
kyng Henry was a falſe traytoure / whiche
faute they ſayd ought nat to be ꝑdoned. Kyng
Henry was more gentyll than ſo / for he had
ſome pytie on hym / for therle excuſed hym and
ſayd / that he dyd / was by the kynges cōmaundement / 
& by the ſettyng on of the four knyghtes
that were beheeded. Kinge Henry beleued
well the erles wordes / but his coūſayle wolde
nat beleue it / but ſaid / and ſo dyd ye londoners
that he ſhulde dye / bycauſe he had deſerued
deth. Thus the erle of Salyſbury was in priſon
in great daunger of his lyfe. And ſyr Iohan
Holande erle of Huntyngdon capytayne
of Calais / was well enfourmed of the hole mater / 
and howe his brother kyng Rychard was
taken and in priſone in the towre of London / 
and had reſygned his crowne and all / & howe
Henry of Lancaſtre was kinge of Englande.
This erle of Huntyngdon / what ſo euer dyſpleaſure
he had for the trouble of his brother / 
yet wyſely he conſydred the tyme and aduentures / 
and ſawe well yt he was nat able to with
ſtande all the power and puyſſaunce of the realme.
Alſo the counteſſe his wyfe / who was coſyn
germayne to kynge Henry / ſayd. Syr / it
muſt behoue you to paſſe your diſpleaſure pacyently
& wyſely / and do nat that thynge wherby
ye ſhall haue dōmage / for the kyng may do
you moche good / and ye ſe that all the realme
enclyneth to hym / if ye ſhewe any dyſpleaſure
to hym warde / ye are but loſt. wherfore ſyr / I
requyre you and I coūſayle you to dyſſimule
the matter / for as well kynge Henry nowe is
your brother as kyng Richarde was / therfore
ſyr ſtycke and leane to him / and ye ſhall fynde
hym your good louer / for there was neuer a
rycher kynge in Englande than he is / he may
do to you & to your chyldren great good. The
erle herde well the wordes of his wyfe and beleued
her and enclyned hym to kynge Henry / 
and offred hym humble obeyſaunce / and promyſed
hym faythe and trouthe. The kyng receyued
hym and had great ioy therof / and he
dyd ſo moche with meanes of his frēdes / that
therle of Salyſbury was taken to grace / and
his excuſacyons accepted / and was clene pardoned.
         
         
            ¶How newes of the taking of kyng
Rycharde was knowen in Fraunce
by the cōmyng thyder of the lady of
Coucy / and howe the frenche kynge
was dyſpleaſed. Cap. CC.xlvi.
            
               WHan the lady of Coucy was
aryued at Bouloyne / ſhe haſted
her to go to Parys. Great murmurynge
there was in Fraunce
of the ſodayne incidentes yt were
fall in Englāde / they knewe ſomwhat by marchaūtes
of Bruges / but whan the lady of Coucy
aryued / than the trouth was knowen. She
went firſte to her huſbandes houſe / as it was
reaſon. Anon the frenche kynge herde worde
howe the lady of Coucy was come to Parys / 
Than the kynge ſent for the lorde of Coucy / 
who had ben all nyght with his wyfe. Whan
he was come the kynge demaūded of the ſtate
of kynge Rycharde of Englande / and of the
quene his doughter. The lorde durſt nat hyde
the trouth fro hym / but ſhewed hym playnely
euery thynge / as his wyfe had ſhewed hym / 
whiche newes were ſore dyſpleaſaunt to the
frenche kynge / for he knewe well the englyſſhmen
were ſore & harde men to apeaſe / and ſo
with dyſpleaſure the frenche kynge retourned
agayne in to his olde ſicknes of franſey / wherof
the nobles of yt realme were ſore diſpleaſed
but they coude nat amende it. Than the duke
of Burgoyn ſaid / I thought neuer otherwyſe
for it was a maryage without good reaſone / 
the whiche I ſayd playnly ynough whan the
mater was fyrſt ſpokē of / but as than I coulde
nat be herde / for I knewe well ye londoners neuer
loued parfytely kynge Rycharde. All this
myſchefe is engendred by the duke of Glouceſtre / 
it is tyme nowe to take hede what the engliſſhmen
wyll do / ſythe they haue taken their
kyng and put him in priſon. by all lykelyhode
they wyll put hym to dethe / for they neuer loued
him / bycauſe be loued no warre but peace
they wyll crowne to their kynge the duke of
Lancaſtre / he ſhall ſo bynde hym ſelfe to them
that whether he wyll or nat / he ſhall do all that
they wyll / & ſayd moreouer / nowe ſhall be ſene
what they of Burdeaux wyll do / for there he
was borne / and was well be loued with them
and alſo with them of Bayon & of Dax / and
in all the lymytes of Burdeloys / it were good

that yt conſtable of Fraūce ſir Loys of Sanxere
were ſignyfyed of this mater / and that he
drewe hym to yt fronters there / & with him ſyr
Raynolde of Barroys of Barreys and other
barones and prelates and to treate with them
and my brother the duke of Berrey to go in to
Poictou / & to drawe to the fronters of Xaintes / 
of Blaues / and of mirebell / wherby if they
of Burdeaux wyll any thynge entende to our
treaties / that they may be receyued / for nowe
ſhall we haue them or neuer. As he deuyſed it
was ordeyned / the whiche was a ſubſtanciall
deuyce. for whan they of Burdeaux / of Bayon / 
and of Dax / vnderſtode that their kynge
Rycharde was taken and ſette in the towre of
London / and duke Henry of Lancaſtre crowned
kyng / they had gret marueyle therof / and
in the begynnyng wolde nat beleue it / but lytle
& lytle they knewe the trouth therof. Than
the ſayd thre townes were cloſed and no man
ſuffred to iſſue out nor to entre in / they were
ſore troubled and ſorowfull / and ſpecyally the
cytie of Burdeaux / for kynge Rycharde was
noryſſhed amonge them / therfore they loued
hym / and whyle he was kynge if any of Burdeloys
came to hym they were well receyued / 
and alwayes ye kinge was redy to fulfyll their
deſyres / wherfore they ſayd whan they knewe
the trouth. Ah Richarde gentle kyng / ye were
as noble a man as euer reigned in any realme / 
this trouble yt londoners haue cauſed / for they
coulde neuer loue you / ſpecyall ſythe ye were
alyed by maryage with the frenche kyng / this
myſchiefe is ſo great that we can nat ſuffre it?
They haue holden you kynge this .xxii. yere / 
and nowe to condempe you to the dethe / for
ſythe ye be in priſon & haue crowned the duke
of Lancaſtre / they wyll ſurely put you to deth.
So they of Burdeloys made great lamentacyons / 
in ſo moche that the ſeneſchall of Burdeaux
a ryght valyaunt knyght of Englande
wrote letters / therin conteynynge the wordes
and lamentacyons of them of the cytie of Burdeaulx / 
of Bayon / and of Dax. Alſo he wrote
howe they were nere at the poynte to yelde vp
their townes to the frenche kyng. He ſent this
lettre by a truſty ſeruaūt of his by the ſee / who
had good wynde and aryued at Cornewayle
in Englāde / and than he rode ſo longe that he
came to London / there he foūde kynge Henry
and delyuered his letters / whiche were dyrected
to the kynge and to the londoners. They
were opened and reed / and the kynge and the
londoners tooke counſayle vpon that mater.
They of London aunſwered lyke theym that
were nothyng abaſſhed of that tydynges / but
ſayde / as for theſe townes wyll neuer tourne
frenche / for they can nat lyue in their daunger
nor they canne nat ſuffre the extorcion and pollinge
of the frenchmen / for vnder vs they lyue
franke and free / and if the frenche men ſhulde
be lordes ouer them / they ſhulde be taxed and
tayled / & retayled two or thre tymes in a yere / 
the whiche they are nat nowe acuſtomed vnto
whiche ſhulde be a harde thyng nowe for them
to begynne. Alſo theſe thre cyties are cloſed in
roūde about with great lordes / who are good
englyſſhe / and longe haue been / as the lorde
Pyuiers / the lorde Muſydent / the lorde Duras / 
the lorde Landuras / the lorde Copane / 
the lorde Roſem / the lorde Logeren / and dyuers
other barones and knyghtes / by whome
they ſhulde haue warre at their handes / for
they ſhulde nat iſſue out of their cities but they
ſhulde be taken. For all the ſeneſchalles wrytynge
we haue no doute yt they ſhulde become
frenche / howe be it / good it is to ſende thyder
ſome valyaunt wyſe man that is beloued amonge
theym / ſome ſuche as hath gouerned
there or this / and that is the lorde Thomas
Percy. Thus as it was deuyſed it was acomplyſſhed / 
he was deſyred to go thyder / and to
take hede of that coūtrey. He fulfylled the kynges
cōmaundement / and made hym redy to
departe. it was about Chriſtmaſſe / at whiche
tyme the wyndes be ſore and ieoperdous / he
toke ſhyppynge in Cornewayle. He had with
him two hundred men of armes and four hundred
archers. And with hym was his nephue
Hugh Haſtynges / Thomas Colleuyll / Gyllyam
Lyſle / Iohan Graily / baſtarde ſonne to
the Captall of Beufz / Guillyam Traicton / 
Iohan Danbreticourt / and diuers other / and
alſo the byſſhop of London / and mayſter Rycharde
Doall. They taryed tyll it was mydde
Marche or they toke the ſee. and or they came
to Burdeaux the duke of Burbon was come
to the cytie of Dagen to treate with theym of
Burdeloys / and he dyd ſo moche by his fayre
wordes and good aſſuraunce / that the counſayles
of Burdeaux / of Bayon / and of Dax
were ſent to the cytie of Dagen. The duke receyued
them frendly and gaue them fayre wordes
and many promyſes / and ſhewed them

that if they wolde turne frenche / and be vnder
the obeyſaunce of the frenche kynge / what ſo
euer they wolde demaunde ſhulde be graunted
them / and ſealed perpetually to endure.
Many thynges they promyſed and ſware to
ſeale / and to kepe for euer. They aunſwered / 
whan they were retourned agayne in to their
cyties they wolde ſhewe all this to the people / 
and ſo take counſayle and than gyue anſwere.
Thus they departed fro Dagen and fro the
duke of Burbon and retourned to their townes / 
and ſhewed all this to the people / but all
tourned to nothynge / for the comynaltyes of
the ſayde cyties conſydred the buſyneſſe / and
knewe well howe the realme of Fraunce was
vexed and troubled with tayles and fowages
and ſhamfull exaccions all to get money. than
they ſayd / if the frenche men gouerne ouer vs
they wyll bringe vs to the ſame vſage / yet it is
better for vs to be englyſſhe / for they kepe vs
franke and free. If the londoners haue depoſed
kynge Rycharde & crowned kinge Henry
what is that to vs? we haue and ſhall haue alwayes
a kynge / and we vnderſtande that the
byſſhop of London and ſyr Thomas Percy
ſhortely wyll be here / they ſhall enfourme vs of
the trouthe / we haue alſo more marchaundyſe
of woll / wyne / and clothe with the Englyſſhe
men than with the frenchmen. let vs be ware
we make no treatie / wherby we ſhulde repent
vs after. Thus the treatie with the frenche
men was broken and lefte of. Than anone after
the byſſhop of London and ye lorde Percy
with their charge of men of warre aryued at
Burdeaux / wherof moche people were greatly
reioyſed / and ſome diſpleaſed / ſuche as had
rather haue been frenche than englyſſhe. All
theſe englyſſhe lordes were lodged togyther
in the abbey of ſaint Andrewe / and whan they
ſawe their tyme they ſhewed to the people the
ſtate of Englande / and ye cauſe why they were
ſent thyder / and they dyd ſo moche that euery
thynge was apeaſed bothe there and in all other
places: For harde it was to haue cauſed
them to haue tourned frenche.
            THan it was determyned by the counſayle
of Fraunce / ſithe the kyng was
in ſyckneſſe by reaſon of the diſpleaſure
that he toke for the depoſyng of his ſonne
in lawe kynge Rycharde / yt they ſhulde ſende
ſome notable wyſe perſonage in to Englande
to knowe the ſtate of the quene. to do this meſſage
was apoynted ſyr Charles de la Brethe
and Charles of Hangers / who (as they were
cōmaunded) departed fro Parys and came to
Boloygne / and there taryed / for they had ſent
an haraulde to kynge Henry / for without aſſuraūce
they durſt nat go / for all the truce that
was bytwene bothe realmes. Kynge Henry / 
who thought hym ſelfe moche bounde to the
Frenche kynge / for the chere that he hadde in
Fraunce / toke counſayle and concluded / and
ſo the haraulde was anſwered that it was the
kynges pleaſure that they and their company
ſhulde come in to Englande / and to come the
ſtreyght way to the kyng / and nat to ryde out
of the way without lycence. The haraulde retourned
to Boloyne and ſhewed what he had
done / wherwith they were content / and ſo ſhypped
their horſes / and toke the ſee and aryued
at Douer / where they founde redy a knyght
of the kynges howſe / 
                  •
               oho receyued theym.
they had ſene hym before with kyng Henry in
Fraunce / wherby they were ſoner aquaynted.
ſo they taryed at Douer tyll their horſes were
vnſhypped / and than they rode to Caunterbury.
And where ſo euer they bayted or lay their
hoſtes were payed. At laſte they came to Eltham / 
and there they founde kyng Henry and
parte of his counſayle. The kinge made them
good chere for the loue of the frenche kynge.
Than they ſhewed the kyng the cauſe of their
cōmynge. The kynge aunſwered and ſayde.
Sirs / ye ſhal go to London / and there I wyll
be within this foure dayes and aſſemble my
counſayle / and than ye ſhall haue aunſwere of
your demaunde. That daye they dyned with
the kynge / and after dyner they rode to London
and the ſayde knyght of the kynges ſtyll
with them / who ſawe them well lodged. The
kinge acordyng to his promyſe came to Weſtmynſter / 
& theſe frenche knyghtes had knowlege
of the kynges cōmynge thyder / and made
them redy to go whan they ſhulde be ſent for.
The kynge had his counſayle with hym / and
than it was deuyſed what anſwere they ſhuld
haue. than they were ſent for / and than it was
ſhewed them that where as they deſyred to ſe
the quene / their deſyre ſhulde nat be denyed / 
ſo that they wolde ſwere and promeſſe / that
nouther they nor none of their menne ſhulde
ſpeke any worde of that was fallen vpon king
Rycharde / for it was ſaid to them / that if they

dyd they ſhulde rynne in great dyſpleaſure of
the people / and be in great parell of their lyues.
The two knightes ſayd they wolde in no
wyſe breake the ordre that they had ſette / but
obey their cōmaundement. They ſayd whan
they had ones ſene and ſpoken with her / than
they wolde retourne and departe. Anon after
the erle of Northum berlande brought theym
to Haueringe of the bowre to the yonge quene
who was there as than / and with her the duches
of Irelande doughter to the lorde Coucy
and ye ducheſſe of Glouceſtre with her doughters / 
and other ladyes and damoſelles. The
quene receyued them ſwetely / and demaūded
of them howe the frenche kinge her father dyd
and the quene her mother. They ſayde well / 
and ſo cōmuned with her a gret ſeaſon. They
kepte well their promeſſe / for they ſpake no
worde of kynge Rycharde. Than they tooke
leaue of the quene and retourned to London.
Than ſhortely after they wente to Eltham to
the kynge and there dyned / and ye kyng gaue
them fayre preſentes and iowelles / and ryght
amyably they toke their leaue of the kynge / 
who ſayd to them. Syrs / ye may ſay whan ye
come in to Fraunce / yt the quene of Englande
ſhall haue no hurte nor trouble / but ſhall alwaies
kepe her eſtate as to her belongeth / and
ſhall enioy all her right / for as yet ſhe ſhall nat
knowe the mutacyons of the worlde. Of theſe
wordes ſpoken of the kynges mouth / the two
knyghtes were well content / and ſo departed
and lay at Dertforde / and the next day at Oſprynge / 
and ſo to Caunterbury / and than to
Douer. And all their coſtes and charges commynge
& goynge the kynges offycers payed.
Than they tooke the ſee and aryued at Boloyne
and ſo to Parys / and there founde the
kyng and the quene / and ſhewed them all that
they had ſene and herde. ¶Nowe let vs ſomwhat

            ¶Howe certayne lordes in Englande
roſe vp with an army to haue delyuered
kyng Rycharde and to haue
dyſtroyed kynge Henry / and howe
they were ſlayne. Cap. CC .xivii.
            
               DIuers queſtyons and
argumētes were made in
Englande amonge noble
men / and counſayls of the
good townes / yt Richarde
of Burdeaux was deed &
ſlayne / wherfore men ſpake
no more of hym / for well he had deſerued
it. To theſe poyntes kyng Henry anſwered
and ſayd. Nay quod he / I haue pytie of his
dethe / I wyll neuer conſent therto. To kepe
hym in priſone is ſuffycient. I haue warrā
               ted
his lyfe / and I wyll kepe my promyſe. ſuche
as wolde haue had hym deed ſayd. Sir / 
we ſe well ye haue Pytie on hym / but ye do
for your ſelfe a perylous thyng. For as long
as he is a lyue / though he haue willyngly reſigned
to you the crowne of Englande / and
that euery man hath receyued you as kyng / 
and haue made to you faythe and homage / 
yet it can nat be / but that there be in the Realme / 
ſome that loued hym / & as yet do / who
wolde lightly ryſe agaīſt you / if they might
ſe any lykelyhode of his delyueraunce. Alſo
the Frenche kynge is ſore diſpleaſed for his
trouble / he wolde ſoone be reuenged yf he
myght / and he is of great puyſſaunce / with
ſuche ayde as he maye fynde in Englande / 
The kynge aunſwered and ſayde / As longe
as I ſe nat the contrary / or that the Frenche
kyng wyll take no parte agaynſt me / I wyll
kepe my promyſe. This aunſwere that the
kynge made / had nerehande haue ben to his
owne diſtructyon. The erle of Huntyngton
ſir Iohan of Hollande / brother to kyng Richarde / 
who hadde to wyfe kynge Henryes
ſuſter / coulde nat forgette the aduenture of
his brother / No more coude the erle of Saliſbury
/ and they had at Oxenforde ſecrete
counſayle toguyder. And they deuyſed how
they might delyuer kynge Richarde oute of
the towre and diſtroye kyng Henry / & bring
a trouble agayne in to the realme. They deuyſed
to make a iuſtes of twentie knyghtes
and twentie ſquyers to beholden at Oxenforde / 
and howe they wolde deſyre the kyng
to be there priuely. And whyle he ſhulde be
ſyttynge at the table to ſlee hym. For they
had deuyſed to haue hadde men ynowe to haue
perfourmed their ententes / and they had
redy a preeſt called Maladyn / who was a

ſyngar in kynge Rychardes chapell / to haue
putte hym in the Kynges appareyle / for he
was lyke kynge Rycharde in fauoure. And
than they wolde haue made the people to haue
beleued that kynge Richarde hadde been
delyuered / and returned in to his fyrſt ſtate / 
and than̄e to haue ſente worde of their dede
to the Frenche kynge / that he ſhulde incontynent
haue ſente in to Englande / ſome ſocoure
to them by the erle of ſaynt Poule or
by ſome other. As they had deuyſed ſo they
dyde begynne. They cauſed a feeſt at Oxenforde
to be proclaymed of twentie knyghtes
and twentie ſquyers / well accōpanyed with
ladyes and damoſelles. They hadde alſo on
their partie the yonge erle of Kente / nephue
to ſir Iohan Hollande / & alſo another great
lorde the lorde Spenſar. And they beleued
to haue hadde on their partie the erle Iohan
of Rutlande / bycauſe kynge Henry had put
hym out of the offyce of the Cōſtable ſhyppe
of Englande / but he fayled theym / for ſome
ſayde / by hym they were bewrayed. This
feeſt prouyded for / thau the erle of Huntyngton
came to Wyndſore where the kyng was
and humbly made his reuerence / as he that
thought to haue diſceyued the kynge with
ſwete wordes / and to haue gote hym to haue
come to this feeſt / the whiche to do / he deſyred
the kyng effectuouſly / and the kyng who
thought none yuell graunted hym ſo to do / 
wherof the erle was ryght ioyouſe / and departed
fro the kynge and toke his leaue / and
layde to the Chanon Robſarde. Sir / appareyle
you to come to our feeſt / I promyſe the
if I mete the there in the felde / I ſhall gyue
the a fayre encountre with my ſpeare. Than
ſir Iohan Robſarde ſayd. Sir / it the kyng
come to your feeſt / ye ſhall nat fayle to fynde
me there. Than the Erle ſtrake his hande in
his and thanked hym / and ſo paſſed forthe.
Dyuers knightes and ſquyers prepared thē
ſelfes to be at that feeſt. All the armorers in
London were lette a worke to trymme men
in their harneſſe for the Iuſtes. Suche as
were of the kynges counſayle ſayde to hym.
Sir / ye haue nothynge to do there / ye ſhall
nat come there by our aduyſe. We haue herde
certayne wordes in murmuryng / the whiche
are nat very pleaſaunt nor agreable. We
ſhall knowe more ſhortely. The kynge beleued
their counſaile / and ſo came nat at that
feeſt / nor none of his knyghtes / nor but t
                  •
               we
came thyther / of ſuche as they wolde haue
ſlayne.
            
               WHan the erle of Saliſbury / the
erle of Hūtyngton / and the erle
of Kente / and the lorde Spenſar
ſawe that they hadde fayled
of their entente / and that they
coude nat haue the kyng as they wolde / than
they counſayled toguyder and ſayde. Lette
vs go to Wynſore and ſtyrre vp the countre / 
and we ſhall putte Madalyn in eſtate royall / 
and ryde with hym: And make the people
beleue that it is kynge Rycharde / who is
delyuered cut of priſone / all ſuche as ſhall
ſe hym wyll beleue it / & all ſuche as here therof / 
and thus we ſhall diſtroy our ennemyes.
As they deuyſed ſo they dyde / and aſſembled
toguyder / ſo that they were a fyue hundred
men / one and other. And they dyd putte this
Madalyn in appareyle royall / & made hym
to ryde with theym / and ſo rode towardes
Wyndſore where kynge Henry was. Godde
dyde ayde kynge Henry / for tidynges came
to hym howe the ſayd lordes were cōmynge
with a great nombre to Wynſore to ſlee hym
and howe they were men ynowe to wynne
the caſtell / and howe they had made Madalyn
in veſture lyke a kyng / to ryde with thē / 
and made the people beleue that kynge Rycharde
was delyuered / and moche people beleueth
it / And ſome ſaye they haue ſene him / 
and beleue verily that it is he. Wherfore ſir / 
gette you hens incontynent and ryde to Lō
               don / 
for they are cōmynge ſtreyght hyder.
The kynge beleued their counſayle. And ſo
he and all his men lepte on their horſes and
departed fro Wyndſore and rode towardes
London. And the kynge was nat farre gone
but that theſe lordes came to Wyndſore / and
entred in at the gates of the caſtell / for there
was none to ſaye theym naye. Thanne they
wente ſertchynge fro Chambre to chambre / 
and in the Chanons houſes / wenyng to fynde
the kynge / but they fayled. Whanne they
ſawe it wolde nat be they were right ſore diſpleaſed / 
and than departed fro Wynſore and
lay that nyght at Colebroke / and they made

moche people to go with them / what byforce
and by treatie. Sayeng howe kynge Rycharde
was in their company / ſome beleued
it and ſome nat. Kyng Henry who douted of
trayſon / haſted hym in his iourney / and cāe
to the towre of London by a ſecrete waye / 
Than he went to Richarde of Burdeux and
ſayd. I haue ſaued your lyfe wt moche payne
and nowe ye wolde murder me / by your brother
and other / but this enterprice ſhalbe yuell
for you. Richarde of Burdeaux excuſed
hym greatly and ſayd. As god myght helpe
hym and ſaue his ſoule / he knewe nothynge
therof / nor he wolde neuer deſire other aſtate
than he was in. Thus the mater ſtode. Thā
kyng Henry ſent for the mayre of London / &
for other of his ſpeciall frendes / and than he
ſhewed them all the mater as it was. The lō
               doners
had great marueyle therof and ſaid.
Sir / ye muſt ſende for your men and go agaynſt
them be tymes / or they multiply any further.
We haue made you kynge / & ſo ye ſhall
contynue who ſoeuer haue enuy therat. Thā
letters were written in haſt / and meſſangers
ſent forthe in to all partes. The kyng wrote
to his conſtable the erle of Northumberlāde
and to his marſhall the erle of Weſtmerlāde
and to all other knyghtes and ſquyers in to
Eſſexe / and in to other places / where as he
thought to haue ayde of men / ſuche as herde
therof / cāe to the kyng as faſt as they might.
            THan the erles of Huntyngton and
of Saliſbury / and other of their affynyte / 
toke coūſayle and aduyſe to
drawe towardes London / for they ſayde / it
coude nat be none otherwyſe / but that ſome
of the Londoners loued kynge Rycharde / &
all ſuch they ſaid / wolde cōe to take their ꝑte
Than they departed fro Colbroke and went
and lodged at Braynforde / a ſeuyn myle fro
London / but there was neuer a lōdoner that
came to them but drewe all in to their cytie.
Whan theſe lordes ſawe that / the nexte mornynge
they tooke the waye to ſaynt Albons / 
and there lodged and taries there a day / and
fro thens they went to Barcamſtede. Thus
they went about the countre / & ſtyll made to
be reported / that this Madalyn was kyng
Richarde / and ſo came to a good towne called
Suſcettour / where there was a baylye
ſette there by kynge Henry / who had the kepyng
of the towne and the countrey there about.
Whan theſe lordes were come to Suſcettour / 
they lodged there one nyght in reſte
& peace / for the bayly was nat ſtrōg ynough
to fyght with thē / therfore he diſſymuled as
well as he myght. And the nexte mornynge
the erle of Saliſbury and the lorde Spenſar
departed fro the erle of Huntyngton and
fro the erle of Kent / & ſayd howe they wolde
ride further to get & to turne mo men to their
opinyon / & to go & ſe the lorde Bercley / & to
ryde a long by the ryuer of Syuerne. They
were yuell counſayled whan they departed
one fro another / for they were ſo moche the
weaker. The erle of Huntyngton began to
treate with the bayly & with the men of Suſcettour / 
and ſhewed them howe kynge Richarde
was delyuered / & howe that the lōdonets
had / delyuered hym / and that he ſhulde
be there within two dayes after. The bayly
(who had aſſembled a good nombre of them
of the countrey) ſayde / that the contrarye
was trewe / & howe that he had ſuche tidynges
fro kyng Henry and fro the londoners / 
that he wolde execute their cōmaundement.
Whan therle of Hūtyngton herde thoſe wordes
he chaunged colour / & ſawe well he was
diſceyued. Than he entred in to his lodging
and armed hym / and cauſed his mē to do the
ſame / and thought to cōquere thoſe villayns
by batayle and to ſette the towne a fyre / therby
to abaſſhe the people. The baylye of the
towne on the other parte haſted hym / and aſſembled
all his men in a certayne place / and
he was with archers and other a two thouſande
men / and the lordes had nat paſt a thre
hundred men. Howe be it they came oute of
their lodgynges and began the batayle / and
archers ſhotte on bothe partes ſo that many
were hurte. Than the bayly with his great
nombre came vpon them without ſparynge / 
for he had ſpeciall cōmaundement fro kynge
Henry that he ſhulde outher take thē quicke
or deed / if he myght ouercome them. So finally
the Erles menne were fayne to withdrawe
in to the houſes. Than the bayly and
his men enuyroned their lodgynges on all
partes / and ſpecially where the two Erles
were / & made there ſuche aſſautes / that they
entred ꝑforce: There were many hurte and
ſlayne. Therle of Hūtyngton defended him
ſelfe valyauntly as longe as he myght: But

there were ſo many agaynſt hym / that there
he was ſlayne / and with hym the yonge erle
of Kente / for whom great ſorowe was made
in dyuers partes of Englande / for he was a
fayre yonge man / and was there in maner agaynſt
his wyll / but his vncle and the erle of
Saliſbury brought hym therto. The men
of Suſcettour who were fierſe agaynſt thē / 
ſtrake of their heedes and ſent them by a meſſanger
to the mayre of London / therwith to
reioyce the kyng and the londoners. Therle
of Saliſbury and the lorde Spenſar came
to a lyke concluſyon / for certayne knightes &
ſquiers of the kynges toke them where they
were / and ſtrake of their heedes & ſente them
to London / & many ſuche as were with them
alyed were putte to execucion / bothe knyghtes
and ſquyers. After that the realme was
in good reſt and peace.

of men of warre ſhulde drawe to ye marches
of Bretayne to ſpeke with ye bretons / &
wt the coūſaylours of good townes / to know
what they wolde do with their heyre / & to deſyre
thē to delyuer him to be kept in the houſe
of Fraūce. The duke of Orlyaūce dyde acording
to this deuyſe / & with a certayne nōbre
came to Ponthorſon & there reſted / and ſente
worde of his cōmyng to the lordes of Bretaigne.
Than prelates / lordes / & coūſaylours
of the good townes in ye name of the thre eſtates
of the countre aſſembled togider / & were
determyned what aunſwere to make / and ſo
they came to Pounthorſon to the duke of Orlyaunce / 
and there they made their anſwere
all after one ſorte / and that was. They ſaid / 
howe that their yonge lorde & heyre of Bretayne / 
they wolde kepe hym thēſelfes in his
owne countre. Than the duke of Orlyaūce
ſeyng it wolde none otherwiſe be / he toke bō
               des
of the gretteſt lordes in Bretayne / ſuche
as had chefe charge of the countre / that they
ſhulde delyuer hym to the frēche kyng / whā
the childe ſhulde come to his age. Theſe writynges
made and ſealed / than the duke deꝑted
and returned in to Fraunce / and ſhewed
the kyng his brother howe he had ſpedde.
            IT was well knowen in Englande / 
howe the Frenche kyng hadde furnyſſhed
his garyſons / cyties / good
townes & caſtels on the fronters of Picardy
and Bolonois / and howe the frenchmen had
cloſed ſo the paſſagꝭ ouer ye water of Sōme
that no marchandyſe / corne / nor other thyng
ſhulde nat paſſe Abuyle / nor ye marchaūtes
of Englāde / who were wont to go in to Frā
               ce
with their marchaūdiſe / durſt no more cōe
there / nor the frenche marchaūtes durſte nat
come in to Englande / ſo that the fronters on
bothe ꝑties were in gret ruyne & deſolacion / 
and yet they made no warr̄ togyder / for they
had no cōmaūdement ſo to do. Than it was
ſaid to kyng Hēry. ſir / aduyſe you well / it ſemeth
by the Frenchmen they wyll make you
warre: they make great prouiſyon for ſhyppes

at Harflewe / and capitayns of their armye
is / the erle of ſaynt Poule and ſir Charles
de la Breth. And it were to ſuppoſe / that
if the erles of Huntyngton and of Salyſbury
were a lyue / and all ſuche as be dedde / 
the Frenchmen than wolde ſoone paſſe ouer
the ſee / on truſt to haue great alyaunce and
ayde in Englande. But ſir / as longe as Richarde
of Burdeaux is a lyue / you nor your
realme ſhalbe at no ſuretie. I beleue that ye
ſaye is trewe quod the kyng / but as for me I
wyll nat cauſe hym to be ſlayne / for I haue
ſo promyſed hym / and I wyll kepe my promyſe / 
without I ꝑceyue that he worke trayſon
agaynſt me. Well ſir 
                  •
               abqod; they of his counſaill / 
it were better for you that he were deed
rather than a lyue. For as longe as the frenche
men knowe that he is lyueng / they wyll
enforce them to make you warre / and wyll
hope alwayes to bring him agayne in to his
former eſtate / bycauſe of his wyfe the Frenche
kynges doughter. The kyng gaue none
anſwere but departed fro them as than / and
lefte his coūſayle cōmunyng togyder / & the
kynge wente and toke a faucon on his hāde / 
and paſſed ouer that mater.
         
         
            ¶Of the dethe of kyng Richarde of
Englande / and howe the truſe bytwene
Englande and Fraunce was
reuewed. And alſo of the depoſicion
of pope Benedic at Auignon.
Cap. CC .xlix.
            
               IT was nat longe after / 
that true tidynges ran thoroughe
London / howe Richarde
of Burdeaulx was
deed / but howe he dyed & by
what meanes I coulde nat
tell whan I wrote this cronycle.
But this kynge Rycharde deed was
layde in a lytter and ſette in a chayre / couered
with blacke Baudkynne / and foure horſes
all blacke in the chayre / and two men in
blacke leadyng the chayre / and four kynghtes
all in blacke folowyng. Thus the chare
departed fro the towre of London / and was
brought a long throughe London fayre and
ſoftely tyll they cāe into chepeſyde / where as
the chefe aſſembly of Lōdon was / and there
the chare reſted the ſpace of two houres. thyder
came in and out mo than xx.M. perſons
men and women to ſe hym where as he laye / 
his hedde on a blacke quiſſhen / & his viſage
open. ſome had on hym pytie & ſōe none but
ſayd / he had long a go deſerued dethe. Now
cōſyder well ye great lordes / kynges / dukes
erles / barōs & prelates / & all men or great lynage
& puiſſauce: ſe & beholde how the fortunes
of this worlde are marueylous / & turne
diuerſly. This kyng Richarde reigned kynge
of Englāde .xxii. yere in great proſperite / 
holdyng great eſtate & ſignorie. There was
neuer before any kyng of Englande yt ſpente
ſo moche in his houſe as he dyd / by a. C.M.
florens euery yere. For I ſir Iohn̄ Froiſſart
chanon & treaſourer of Chinay knewe it wel
for I was in his court more tha a quarter of
a yere togider / & he made me good chere / bycauſe
yt in my youthe I was clerke & ſeruaūt
to the noble kynge Edwarde the thirde his
grautfather / & with my lady Philyp of Heynault
quene of Englāde his grandame. and
whan I deꝑted fro hym / it was at Wynſore / 
and at my departynge the kyng ſent me by a
knight of his called ſir Iohn̄ Golofer / a gob
let or ſyluer & gylte weyeng two marke of ſiluer / 
& within it a .C. nobles / by the which I
am as yet the better / and ſhalbe as long as I
lyue / wherfore I am boūde to praye to God
for his ſoule / & with moche ſorowe I write of
his dethe. But bicauſe I haue cōtynued this
hiſtorie / therfore I write therof to folowe it.
In my tyme I haue ſene two thingꝭ / though
they differ yet they be true. I was in ye cytie
of Burdeux & ſytting at the table whā kyng
Richarde was borne / ye whiche was on a tuiſday
about .x. of the clocke. The ſame tyme
there cāe there as I was ſir Richarde Poūtcardon
marſhall as than of Ac
                  •
               tayne / & he
ſaid to me. Froiſſart / write & put in memorie
yt as nowe my lady priceſſe is brought abeed
with a fayre ſon on this twelfe daye / yt is the
day of the thre kynges / and he is ſon to a kynges
ſon & ſhalbe a kyng. This gētyll knight
ſaid trouthe / for he was kynge of Englande
xxii. yere. But whan this knyght ſayd theſe
wordes / he knewe full lytell what ſhulde be
his concluſyon. And the ſame tyme that kynge
Richarde was borne his father the prince
was in Galyce / the whiche kyng Dompeter

had gyuen him / and he was there to cōquere
the realme. Vpon theſe thyngꝭ I haue greatlye
ymagined ſythe / for the fyrſt yere that I
cāe in to Englāde in to the ſeruyce of quene
Philyppe / Kynge Edwarde and the quene / 
and all their chyldren were as than at Barcamſtede / 
a maner of the prince of Wales be
yonde London. The kynge and the Quene
were came thyder to take leaue of their ſofie
the prince and the prīceſſe / who were goyng
in to Acquitayne. And there I herde an aū
               cient
knyght deuyſe amonge the ladyes and
ſayde. There is a booke whiche is called le
Bruſt / and it deuyſeth that the prince of Wales
eldeſt ſon to the king / nor the duke of Clarence / 
nor the duke of Gloceſtre ſhuld neuer
be kyng of Englāde: but ye realme & crowne
ſhuld returne to ye houſe of Lacaſtre. There
I Iohan Froiſſart auctour of this cronycle
cōſydring all theſe thynges. I ſay theſe two
knyghtes / ſir Richarde Pountcardon & ſir
Bartylmewe of Bruels layd bothe trouthe / 
For I ſawe / and ſo dyde all the worlde / Rycharde
of Burdeaux .xxii. yere kyng of Englande / 
and after ye crowne retourned to the
houſe of Lancaſtre. And yt was whan kyng
Hēry was kyng / the which he had neuer ben
if Richarde of Burdeaux had dalte amyably
with hym: for the Londoners made hym
kyng / bycauſe they had pytie on hym and on
his chyldren. Thus whan kynge Richarde
had layne two houres in the chare in Chepe
ſyde / than they draue the chayre forwarde.
And whan the foure knyghtes that folowed
the chare a ſote were without London / they
lept than on their horſes / whiche were there
redy for them. And ſo they rode tyll they cāe
to a vyllage called Langle / a .xxx. myle from
Lōdon: and there this kyng Richarde was
buryed / god haue mercy on his ſoule.
            Tydinges ſpredde abrode howe kyng
Richarde was deed / he taryed euery
daye for it / for euery man myght
well conſydre / that he ſhulde neuer come out
of priſone a lyue. His dethe was long kepte
and hydde fro his wyfe. The Frenche kynge
and his counſayle were well enformed of
all this / and the knightes and ſquyers deſyred
nothyng but ye warre / & that they myght
ryde vpon the fronters. Howe be it the counſayls / 
as well of the one realme as of the other
toke their aduyſe / and thought it beſt to
vpholde ſtyll the truſe that was taken before
they thought it more ꝓfitable than ye warre.
And a newe treatie was deuyſed to be in the
marches of Calais / bycauſe the frēche kyng
was nat in good caſe nor had nat been / ſythe
he knewe of the trouble that kyng Richarde
was in. And yet his ſickeneſſe doubled whā
he knewe that he was deed / ſo that the duke
of Burgoyne had the chefe rule of ye realme.
And he came to ſaynt Omers & to Burbour
                  •
               
where the duke of Burbone was & ſir Charles
de la Breſt / and Charles of Hangeers &
Iohan of Caſtell Morant. and of prelates / 
the patriarke of Ieruſalem / and the byſſhoppes
of Paris and of Beauoyes. And on the
Englyſſhe partie there was the erle of Northumberlande / 
the erle of Rutlande / the erle
of Deuonſhyre / and the lorde Henry Percy
the erles ſonne / and yuan of Fitzwaren. and
prelates / there were the byſſhoppes of Wyncheſter
and of Ely. The frenche men demaū
               ded
to haue agayne delyuered ye yong quene
of Englande / but the Englyſſhe men wolde
in no wyſe delyuer her / but ſayd / ſhe ſhulde
lyue ſtyll in Englāde vpon her dowrie. and
that though ſhe had loſt her huſbande / they
wolde prouyde for her another / yt ſhulde be
fayre / yong / & gentyll / with whom ſhe ſhuld
be better pleaſed than with Richard of Burdeaux / 
for he was olde: and this ſhuld be the
prince of Wales / eldeſt ſofie to kyng Henry.
To this the Frenchmen wolde nat agre / for
they wolde nat conſent therto without licēce
of the kyng her father / who as than was nat
in good poynt / for he was farr̄ out of ye way
no medyſyn coude helpe hym. So that mater
was layde aparte and the treatie of truſe
went forwarde / in ſuche wyſe / that by cōſent
of bothe parties / they ſware and were boūde
to kepe the truſe .xxvi. yere more / to the four
yeres that it had endured / the whiche in all
was .xxx. yere / accordynge to the fyrſt couenaūt.
and vpon this / writynges were made
and ſealed by procuracyons of bothe kyngꝭ.
this done / euery man returned to their own
countreis. ¶I haue nat as yet ſhewed you
what became of therle Marſhall / by whom
fyrſt all theſe trybulacyons began in the realme
of Englande / but nowe I ſhall ſhewe
you. He was at Venyce / and whā he knewe
that kyng Henry was kyng and kynge Rycharde

taken & deed. He toke therof ſo great
diſpleaſure and ſorowe / that he layde hym
downe on his bedde and fell in a franſy / and
ſo dyed: Suche miſcheuouſneſſe fell in thoſe
dayes vpon great lordes of Englande.
            ¶And in the yere of oure lorde god a thouſande
four hundred one leſſe. Pope Benedic
at Auignon / who had ben ſuſteyned long by
the Frenche men / was as than depoſed. And
in lykewiſe ſo was the kynge of Almaygne
for his yuell dedes. For the clectours of the
Empyre / and all the dukes and barons of Almaygne
roſe agaynſt hym / and ſente hym in
to Boeſme / where as he was kyng. and they
choſe another a valyaunt and a wyſeman to
be kyng of Almayne / and he was one of the
Bauyers / and was called Robert of Heleberge.
And he came to Coloygne where he
was crowned with the crowne of Almayne / 
for they of Ayes wolde nat open their towne
to hym / nor the duke of Guerles wolde nat
be vnder his obeyſaunce. This newe kynge
of Almaygne promyſed to bring the churche
to a vnyte and peace. Howe be it the Frēche
kynge and his counſayle treated with the legeoys / 
who helde with the pope at Rhome.
And they dyde ſo moche by the meanes of ſir
Baudwyn of Mount Iardyne / who gouerned
a great parte of ye byſſhoprike of Liege / 
who was a knyght of the Frenche kynges / 
ſo that by his meanes at the deſyre of the frē
               che
kyng / the countrey of Liege tourned to
become neuter: ſo that the Legeois ſente to
Rome for all the clergy yt were there of their
countrey to come by a certayne day / or els to
leſe all their benefyces in the countre. Whan
they herde that / they returned fro Rome and
cāe to Liege. And pope Bonyface / who loſt
moche by that tranſmutacion / ſente a legate
in to Almaygne to preche amonge them / to
cauſe them to retourne agayne to his parte / 
but the legate durſt nat paſſe Coloigne / and
ſent letters to Liege. Whanne thoſe letters
were reed ye meſſanger was aunſwered / that
on payne of drownyng he ſhulde no
more comeon ſuche meſſage.
For they ſayd / as many
meſſanger as
cometh
with any ſuche meſſage / ſhalbe
drowned in the ryuer
of Moeuze.
