            R.G. the tranſlatour of M. Iunius his letters: To the Chriſtian Reader.
            SVch as of late yeares have rent themſelues from the holie ſervice of God, uſed im the publique congregations and Churches of England, being deſtitute of any ſound warrant from the worde of God, have ſought from time to time ſo much the more earneſtly (as the manner of ſuch is) to ſhroude themſelves vnder the ſhadowe of humane authoritie. Hēce it came to paſſe that Maſter Francis Iunius, a mā of great learning, and godlineſſe, was ſolicited by ſome of them (as may appeare by theſe letters enſuing) in the yeare 99. to be a favourer of their erronious opinions and of their vnchriſtian diſordered and vndutifull proceedings: whoſe anſwere, being delivered by himſelfe to a religious and worſhipful knight, and ſo comming to my handes, I have preſumed to communicate with thee, by the motion of ſome godly and well diſpoſed, hoping that through the bleſſing of God, and thy prayers it may proove a good meanes to ſtay ſuch as are wavering, to confirme ſuch as doe ſtand, and to recover ſuch as are fallen. For although he doe not enter into an exact diſcuſſing of the queſtion with arguments, objections, and anſweres: yet he vſeth a very grave and godly admonition, which is oftentimes of greater fruite, then a long and learned diſputation. And whoſoever doth diligently ſtudie the booke of God, ſhal finde, that the holy Prophets & Apoſtles do in manie places inſiſt upō a plaine & ſimple aſleve
                  •
               ation of the truth rather then vpon multitude of proof & arguments. Beſides, if we obſerve the ſtory of the holy Martyrs of our own Church & others, we may preceive that by the ſound profeſſion of their faith, and ſuffering for the ſame, they have glorified God and advanced the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt aſwel as others have done by arguments and reaſons. And yet notwithſtanding if thou do well obſerue theſe letters of Maſter Iunius, thou ſhalt finde in them not vaine and emptie wordes: but waightie and ſounde reaſons grounded upon the holie Scriptures of God. Thus praying thee to take theſe firſt fruites of my poore laboures in this kinde in good part, and beſeching god to give a bleſſing hereunto; I bid thee heartily farewel in the Lord.

More ſpecially they dedicated that litle book to al Chriſtian vniverſities neer about to be diſcuſſed / approved or reproved by the godly learned in them And ſending one in particular to the hands of M.H.

               The Prelates and Prieſts do alvvay cry out, that vve are Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Sectaryes. Hovvbeit let thē knovv, that the crime of Hereſy is not to be imputed to thē, vvhoſe faith doth vvholy rely vpon moſt ſure grounds of the Scripture: That they are not Schiſmaticks, vvho entierly cleave to the true Church of God, ſuch as the Prophets and Apoſtles do deſcribe vnto vs: Nor they to be counted Sectaryes, vvho embrace the truth of God vvhich is one and alvvayes like it ſelf.

               The Engliſh exiles in the Low countreys, wiſh grace and peace in Ieſus Chriſt.
               THis true confeſſion of our faith, in our judgment wholy agreable to the ſacred Scripture, we do here exhibit vnto all to be diſcuſſed: and vnto you (reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two cauſes. Firſt, for that we know you are able in reſpect of your ſingular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are willing in reſpect of your ſyncere piety, to convince our errours by the light of Gods word, if in any thing we be out of the way. Secondly, that this teſtimony of Chriſtian faith, if you alſo fynd it agree with the word of truth, may by you be approved, eyther in ſilence or by writing, as you ſhall think beſt.
               It may be, we ſhalbe thought very bold, that being deſpiſed of all, yet doubted not to ſollicite you ſo many and ſo great learned men. But this we did, partly at the requeſt of others to whom we would not deny it: partly with deſier to have the truth through your help better defended and further ſpread abroad: partly cōſtreyned by our exile and other calamityes almoſt infinite: partly alſo moved with love of our native coūtrey, and of theſe wherein now we live, and others elſe where: wiſhing that all may walk with a right foot to the truth of the Goſpell, and praying daily vnto God, that the great work of reſtoring Religion and the Church decayed, which he hath happily begun in theſe latter tymes, by our Gracious Soveraigne and the other Princes of theſe countreyes and ages (his ſervants) he would fully accompliſh, to the glory of his name and eternall ſalvation in Chriſt of his elect in all places of the earth.
               As for the cauſes which moved vs to publiſh this Confeſſion of faith, and to forſake the Church of England as now it ſtādeth, we have truly and as briefly as we could related them in the Preface to the Reader, hereafter following: and therefore thought here to omit the repetition of them. The Lord Ieſus alway preſerve you and your Vniverſityes to the praiſe of his name, the ornamēt of good learning, the propagation and maintenance of his pure Religion. From Amſterdam in the low countreyes. The yeare of the laſt patience of the ſaints, 1598.
            
            
               
               The preface to the Chriſtian Reader.
               IT may ſeeme ſtrange vnto thee (Chriſtian Reader) that any off the Englyſh nation ſhould for the truth of the Goſpell be forced to forſake their natyve contrye / and lyve in exile / eſpecially in theſe dayes / when the Goſpell ſeemeth to have free paſſage / and floriſh in that land. And for this cauſe have our exile bene hardly thought of by many / and evil ſpoken of by ſome who know not (as it ſeemeth) eyther the trewe eſtate of the Church of England or cauſes of our forſaking and ſeparating from the ſame / but hearing this ſect (as they call it) to be every where ſpoken againſt have (with out at all further ſearch) accounted and divulged vs as heretickes / or Schiſmatickes at the leaſt.Act. 28, 22 Yea ſome (and ſuch as worſt might) have ſought the increaſe of our afflictions / even here alſo yf they could, which thinge they have / both ſecretly and openly attempted. This hath Sathan added vnto all our former ſorrowes / envying that we ſhould have reſt in any part of the Rev. 12. inhabyted world / and therfor ceaſeth not to make warre with the remnant of the womans ſeed / which keepe the commaundemēts of God and have the teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt. But the Lord that Pſal. 105, 13, 14. brought his former Iſraell out off Egypt / and when they walked aboute from nation to natiō / from one Kingdome to an other people / ſuffered no man to do them wronge / but reproved kinges for their ſakes: the ſame Lord yet lyveth to maynteyne the right off his afflicted ſervantes / whome he hath ſevered / and dayly gathereth out off the world / to 1 Pet▪ 2.9. be vnto himſelff a choſen generatiō / a royall prieſthood a peculiar people and Iſraell off God: He Pſal. 46.1. is our hope and ſtrength and helpe in trobles ready to be found / he will hyde vs vnder his winges / and vnder his feathers we ſhall be ſure vntyll theſe myſeries be over paſt. And though we could for our partes well have borne this rebuke off Chriſt in ſilence / and left our cauſe to him who iudgeth iuſtly all the children off men: yet for the manyfeſtation and clearing of the truth off God from reproche off men / and for the bringing off others togither with our ſelves to the ſame knouwledge and fellowſhip off the Goſpell / we have thought it needfull and our duty to make knowen vnto the world / our vnfeyghned fayth in God / and loyall obedience towardes our Prince / and all Governours ſet over vs in the Lord / together with the reaſons off our leaving the miniſtery worſhip and Church off England. Which are not (as they pretend) for ſome fewe faultes and corruptions remayning / ſuch as we acknowledge man be found in the perfecteſt Church on earth: Neyther count we it lawfull for any member to forſake the fellowſhip off the Church for blemyſhes and imperfections / which every one according to his calling ſhould ſtudeouſly ſeeke to cure / and to exſpect and further it vntyll eyther there followe redreſſe or the diſeaſe be growen incureable / and the Apoc. 2, 5. candleſtick be moved out off the place. But we having through Gods mercy learned to diſcerne betwixt 2 Cor 6, 14, 15, &c. Pſal 9

Rev. 18, 4. & 14, 1. the evill and chooſe the good to forſake Babell the land off our captyvitie / and get vs vnto Sion the mount of the Lordes holynes / and place where his honour dwelleth.
               But firſt we deſyre thee / good Reader to vnderſtand / and mynde that we have not in any diſlyke of the civill eſtate and politicke goverment in that common wealth / which we much lyke and love ſeperated our ſelves from that Churche: Neyther have we ſhaken of our alleageance and dutyfull obedyence to our Soveraigne Prince Elezabeth her honorable Conſellers and other Magiſtrates ſet over vs but have alwayes and ſtill do reverence love and obey them every one in the Lord / oppoſing our ſelves againſt al enemyes forreigne or domeſticall: againſt

Neiter have our greateſt adverſaryes ever bene able to attaint vs of the leaſt diſloyalty in this regarde. And though now we be exiled / yet do we dayly pray and will for the preſervation peace and proſperity off her Majeſtie and all her domynions
               And wheras we have bene accuſed off intruſion into the Magiſtrates office / as goeing about our ſelves to reforme the abuſes in that land / it is a mere malicious calumnie / which our adverſaries have forged out of their owne hart.Neh. 6, 6.7.8. We have alwayes both by word and practiſe ſhewed the contrary / neyther ever attempted or purpoſed any ſuch thinge: but have indevored thus onely to reforme our ſelves and our lyves according to the rule off Gods word / by abſteyning from all evyll and keeping the commandements off Ieſus: leaving the ſuppreſſing and caſting out off thoſe remnants of Idolatry / vnto the Magiſtrates / to whome it belongeth.
               And further we teſtifye by theſe preſents vnto all men / and deſyre them to take knowledge herof that we have not forſaken any one poynt of the true ancient catholicke and apoſtolicke fayth profeſſed in our land: but hold the ſame groundes of Chriſtian religion with them ſtill / agreeing lykewiſe herein / with the Dutch / Scottyſh / Germane / French / Heldetian / and all other Chriſtian reformed Churches round about vs / whoſe confeſſions publyſhed / we call to witnes our agrement with them in matters of greateſt moment / being cōferred with theſe articles of our fayth following.Harmon of confeſſ.

This people yet ſtandinge in this fearfull ſinfull ſtate / in idolatry / blyndnes ſuperſtitiō and all manner wickednes / without any profeſſed repentance / and without the meanes theroff / namely the preaching off the word goeing before / were by force and aucthority of lawe onely compelled / and together receved into the boſome / and body of the Churche / their ſeed baptiſed themſelves receved and compelled to the Lords ſupper / had this miniſtery and ſervyce (which now then uſe) inioyned and ſet over them / and everſynce they and their ſeed remayne in this eſtate / being all but one body comonly called the Church of England▪ Here are none exempted or excluded / be they never ſoo prophane or wretched no athieſt / adulterer / thiefe / or murderer / no lyer / periured / witche or coniurer and c. all are one fellowſhip one body / one Churche.

               Secondly as they have reteyned the whole rout of the popyſh multitude without any diſtinction / for members of their Churche: ſo have they ſet over them (as reaſon was) the ſame popyſh Clergie and Prelacy / which they receved from the Romyſh Apoſtaſie and this day is to be found in the popyſh Churches:About forty eccleſiaſtical popiſh offices are at this daye in the Churche of Englād never a one appointed by Chriſt in his teſtament. to wit

                   / Archbs, Primats, Bbs, Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeacōs, Deanes, Chauncellors, Commiſſaries, and the reſt of that rable / which rule and governe theſe aſſemblyes according to the popyſh cannons / rites / and cuſtomes. Theſe have the power and aucthoritie in their hādes to ſet forth iniunctions / to make and depoſe miniſters▪ to excomunicate both prieſt and people which they do very exquiſitly if they yeld not vnto them their due homage and obedience. Theſe have both Eccleſiaſticall and civill aucthoritie / to reigne as Princes in the Churche and lyve as Lordes in the common wealth / to punyſh impriſon / and perſecute evē to death all that dare but once mutter againſt their vnlaufull proceedinges. Of theſe prelates tyranny cruelty and vnlawfull aurthoritie the better ſort both of preachers and people have cryed out / and longe tyme ſued vnto the Prince and parliamēt to have them removed out of the Churche / as being the lymmes of Antichriſt.Apoc. 13. But not prevayling they are now content (for avoyding of the croſſe of Chriſt / to ſubmitt them ſelves and their ſoules to this Antichriſtian Hierarchie / and beare the ſinfull yoke and burthen of their traditions / and to receve and carry aboute the dreadfull and deteſtable marke of the beaſt vpon them.
               Thirdly / The inferiour miniſtery of that Churche / conſiſteth of Prieſts / Parſons / Vicars / Curats / hired preachers / or Lecturers, with Clarkes, Sextons, &c. all which have receved their offices callings and aucthoritie from their

Decrees, thereby to worſhip God / to marry / to bury / to church women / to viſit the ſicke / give him the Sacrament / and forgyve him all his ſinnes: and if their lyvinges or benefices (as they are called) amount to a certeyne ſumme of money in the Queenes booke / then muſt they preach / or get ſome other to preach for them fower ſermons in a yere in their pariſh / where alſo muſt be noted that the moſt part of theſe Prieſtes are utterlye vnlearned / and cannot preache at all: wherby it cometh to paſſe that moſt of the people are as blynde as they were in the darke dayes of popery. Theſe miniſters generally / aſwel preachers as other / lyve in feare and ſervitude vnder their foreſaid Lords the Bbs. for as without their lycence wrytten and ſealed they cannot preach / ſo vpon their diſpleaſure and for not obeying their injunctions / they are many tymes ſuſpēded degraded / and if they will not be ruled / put in priſon: ſo that ſundry of them have bene ſuſpended and impriſoned for preaching againſt the Prelats, not ſubſcribing to their deviſed articles and booke of comon prayer not wearing the ſquare capp and ſurplus / not reading the ſervice booke / and be tyed to the ſame / not coming to the Biſhops courtes / viſitations / inquiſitions / and c. tyll now of late being wearyed with theſe trobles / they give place to their tyranny / and are content to conforme themſelves / and yelde their canonicall obedience according to their oathe / keeping now ſilence / yea going back / bearing and bolſtering the thinges / which heretofore by word and wryting they ſtoode againſt ſo longe as there was any hope that the Queene and Counſell would have harkened vnto them / and put theſe adverſary Prelats out of the Churche.
               Fourthly / for the adminiſtration / which is by lawe impoſed vpon all both Clergie and Laitie, (for ſo they diſtinguiſh them) they have gathered their ſervice booke verbatim out of the maſſe boo

By it are they inioyned to keepe their holy dayes to their Lady (as they call her) to all Saincts and Angells / to all Chriſtes Apoſtells / (except Paul and Barnabas) whoſe eves they are commaunded to faſt / as alſo their Lent and Ember dayes / beſydes frydayes / and ſatardayes through out the whole yere. By this booke are the miniſters inſtructed how to marry with the ſigne of the Ringe / and c. to baptiſe in the hallowed Font with ſigne of the croſſe / with Godfathers and Godmothers / aſking the childe whether it will forſake the devyll and all his workes / and c. to miniſter alſo their other ſacrament or communion to the people kneeling / as when in popery they receved their maker / the wordes of Chriſtes inſtitution altered and others in ſtead of them takē out of the popes portuis / with innumerable ſuch lyke enormyties and fopperies wherewith it ſwarmeth. And this is all the worſhip and ſervice which many pariſhes have contynually / except peradventure ſome wrytten homelyes which the vnlearned prieſtes read vnto them. This ſervice muſt firſt be read / and hath the preeminence even on the Lordes dayes before any preaching yra before the Bible it ſelf: He that can read this booke diſtinctly is fit ynough with them to be prieſt / yea many that have ben Artificers / as Shoemakers / Taylers / Weavers / Porters / and c. and with out any giffes or knowledge at all / ſave only to read Englyſh / have bene and are admytted and to this day maynteyned by the prelats in the miniſtery. To theſe Churches miniſters and ſervyce muſt all the people there come every daye / yea though they have in the next pariſh a preacher / and in their owne a dumbe vnlearned prieſt / yet are they all tyed to their owne Church / and miniſter / and muſt at the leaſt twiſe a yere receve the Sacrament at his handes. If they refuſe this / or do not ordinaryly come to their pariſh Churche then are they ſummoned / excommunicated / and impriſoned / tyll they become obedient. In this bō
                  dage are our countrymen there held vnder their Prieſts and Prelates: and ſuch as by the word of God witnes againſt and condemne theſe abhominations / they hate punyſh put to death / and perſecute out of the land. Who now in whome any ſparke of true light is cannot playnly perceive this their miniſtery worſhip and Churche to be falſe and adulterate? doth Chriſtes eternall teſtament or deyne and approve of ſuche popiſh Lordes and Prelats to reigne over his Churche? are theſe thoſe Chriſtian Biſhops / that is Rom. 12 1. Cor. 12. Eph. 4. Paſtors / Teachers and Elders / which he hath ſet in his Churche and over his owne people vnto the worldes end? Or can choſe preachers which are thus created and depoſed by / thus ſworne and obediēt vnto / their ſpirituall lordes / be deemed true teachers of the Goſpell of Chriſt lawfully called and ordeyned to that miniſterye? Is that their Englyſh Maſſe the trewe and Iohn. 4, 24 Mat 15, 9 ſpirituall worſhip of God according to his owne wil? we are taught in the ſcriptures Deu 6, 4, 5 Mat. 16, 6 2. Cor. 6, 14 15 Pſal 106, 34 35.36. that there can be no agrement made betwixt Chriſt and Antichriſt / betwixt the Lawes of God and mens traditions: that the ſervants of Ieſus may not ſubmytt unto or receve the marke of that beaſt / neyther drinke of the cup of the whore of Babylons fornycations / or buy any of her wares: but muſt

               If Chriſt be God let vs follow him: but if the pope be God / what ſhall wee ſay? why have we left him / his Church and miniſtery / his worſhip and juriſdiction / or what halting and mocking with the Lord is this / to put away the popes perſon and retayne his prelacy and miniſtery his Lawes / Traditiōs and Cannons / his worſhip and ſervice:Mat. 6, 24. or at the leaſt to frame vnto our ſelves a worſhip miniſtery and Church after the patterne and mould of the Apoſtacye of Roome / which what other thing is it / them to make an Image of that firſt wild beaſt / and force men to worſhip it?2.

               Thus ſeeſt thow briefely (good Chriſtian Reader) the thinges which we miſlike in the Churche of England / and for which we have ſeparated our ſelves / as God commandeth.Ier. 51, 6. Mich. 2, 10. Rev. 18, 4. 2 Cor. 6, 17. Act. 2, 40. To all theſe / if we were amongſt them / ſ—uld we be forced to ſubmytt our bodyes and ſoules / or els ſuffer violence at the handes of the Prelats / and end our lyves by violent death or moſt miſerable impriſonment / as many of our bretheren before vs have donne. For ſo great is the malice and power of thoſe romyſh prieſts / that they perſecute vnto death ſuch as ſpeake againſt them: and ſuch poore Chriſtians as they caſt into their noyſome pryſons / can ſeldome or never get out (except with ſhipwracke of cōſcience) vntyll they be caryed forth vpon the Bere. Neyther is there any care taken for their reliefe in this caſe: but being thus caſt into pryſon / there they are deteyned without any alloweance of meate or money for their mayntenance / be their want and poverty never ſo great. If they have any thing of their owne / there they are driven to ſpend it vp: if they have nothing / there they are left by the Prelats to feede on the ayre. And that they maye more readily be ſterved / or weakened in the truth / they are comonly ſhut vp in cloſe priſon / their frends and acquayntance being not ſuffered to come at them: Nay even their wyves and children being kept and debarred from them by the tyranny of theſe bloddye Prelats and their inſtruments: whoſe hard hartes and vnnaturall cruelty / if thou dideſt vnderſtand (gentle Reader) as many of vs have felt / and to this daye yet feele it would make thy hart to bleede / conſidering their vnmercyfull and barbarous dealing. And how many ſoules have periſhed in their priſons through miſerable vſage / how many have ben put to death and how many banyſhed / though we could to their eternall infamy relate to all the world / yet wil we not blaze abroad their acts (for we take no delight in laying open their ſhame) but mourne for them in ſecret / commytting our cauſe to God that judgeth juſtly / knowing that he Pſ. 9.12▪
                   that maketh inquiſition for blood remembreth it / and will not forget the complaint of the poore. And thou (Chriſtian Reader) voutch ſafe to remember vnto God in thy prayers ſuch as yet remayne in bandes and pryſon amongeſt them for the teſtymony of Ieſus / enduring a hard fight of afflictions / and having the ſentence of death in themſelves are lyke (if the Lord ſend not vnexſpected delyverance) there to end their dayes.Heb. 13, 3▪

Wherein if in any thinge we erre (as who is ſo perfit that he erreth not) we reade (good reader) thy Chriſtian brotherly cenſure and information / promyſing alwayes (through the grace of God) to yeild vnto the truth when it ſhall be further ſhewed vs / and leave our errors when by the light of his word they ſhalbe reproved.

               To his beloved in Chriſt the Brethren of the Engliſh Church, now abiding at Amſterdam.
            
            
               GRace mercie and peace from God the Father and our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt. I have received of late (belooved Brethren in Chriſt) a little booke by one of your companie; which is intituled, The confeſſion of faith of ſome Engliſh men baniſhed in Belgia, and have knowne your deſire partly by the ſpeach of the ſame meſſenger, partly by the preface of the writing. But as concerning my ſelfe, beloved brethren, whom M. Iunius his words are, propter vicinitatem which R.G. in his tranſlation hath omitted.for nearnes ſake peradventure yee have thought meete to be called vpon a part, I verily ſee not how much I can doe in this cauſe, or how I can fit your purpoſe. For I knowe that now long ſince euery man doth abound in his owne ſenſe; and that thoſe that are other wiſe minded areFraterno animo. with a brotherly mynd ſo fare to be borne with, holding the heade and fundation, til the Lord reveale things further vnto them. I know it is my part not to play the buſie body, but that I ſhould ſerve the truth and charitie in my ſtanding and meaſure which the Lord hath beſtowed vpon me, in Chriſtian modeſtie and ſimplicitie, as farre as my ſkil and abilitie wil ſtretch vnto. Certainely when I conſideredCauſ

                  . this cauſe more diligently, I thought nothing more commodious or more ſafe for the publick and for you and my ſelfe, in all this matter, thē that we ſhould embrace a holy ſilēce, if there be any thing, wherein we be offended, and that we commit our cauſe to the Lord, the author of our faith, and righter of our cauſe. But becauſe after a ſort, you will not ſuffer mee to be ſilent, and to cōdole in ſecret for the woundes of the Church, which is rent more then inough, by actions, eſpecially being thruſt forth in publik in this our age; I wil declare faith fully, and with a good cōſcience before God what I thinke: beſeeching him who is author of truth and peace that he would leade both you and me alike into all truth according to his promiſe, & alſo diſpoſe each of our mindes and affections to interpret brotherly one anothers

requeſtes, anſweres, admonitions, and finally all our duties, although (as it commeth to paſſe, and is incident to man) diſagreeing from our ſenſe and taſte.
            I obſerue therefore that there are three heads or chief poynts in your little booke, wherein you deſire our counſell and iudgement. The firſt head is of doctrine, which you profeſſe in your little booke. The ſecōd is of fact, whereof yee accuſe the Engliſh Churches. Laſtly the third is, of the concluſion, which you inferre by comparing that your doctrine with that practiſe of England; namely that yee cannot with good conſcience entertaine a communiō with thoſe Churches, but that yee doe abhorre them with all your heartes. Therefore I will ſpeak briefely of theſe 3. things,Vt ſentio. what I think, entreating you brotherly to take my anſwere in good part.
            I marvell that the point of doctrine, or little booke of your confeſſion, beloved brethrē, is ſent ouer to me. I marvell that it was ſent ouer to all the ſtudents of holy Scriptures in all Chriſtian Vniuerſities; for if there be a certaine conſent of doctrine as you pretend it, truely I do not ſee what need there was, that you ſhould ſet forth a newe confeſſion in this conſent of holy and auncient doctrine. But if there be a diſſention peradventure in the doctrine, or rather a differēce, that in deed ought not to bee diſſembled, if ſo be that yee thought it neceſſarie, that your doctrine ſhould be declared.
            Beſides, in that you ſend to mee; yea that you ſend to publicke viewe, Confeſſionem.your confeſſion, I marvell, brethren, yea I greatly maruell, what your meaning ſhould bee, both in reſpect of the ende and the fact. For if ye haue ſet it foorth to that end, that yee might purge your ſelues, I pray you brethren, wherefore doe yee deſire, to purge your ſelues with ſo many ſoules; who have not knowē you as yet to bee accuſed; who can neuer take knowledge of the right or wrong of your accuſation; and who are not called vnto it by any lawfull means? and (that which is worſe) wherfore would yee haue this done before ſo manyInfeſtis. deadly enemies to God and the Church, who thirſt after nothing ſo much as the blood of the Church of God, and doe reioyce that we vndiſcreetly make a publiſhing of theſe wounds: that they by theſe very wounds might ſpoyle the Church, that pretious bodie of Chriſt, of the blood of veritie, and juyce of charitie? Finally, why doe yee this before ſo many weake ones, who not yet knowing, that yee are borne (as I may ſo ſay) are offēded, rather with a carcaſſelike ſtink of ſchiſmes in the Church, before they knowe certainely the bodie whereunto they may cleaue?

Alas brethren, is your purgation ſo much worth vnto you that therfore the publicke good of the Church ſhould bee brought into ſo greate danger? A Chriſtian an humble, and godly minde ought to bee otherwiſe affected, and ſetting aſide the reſpect of their owne priuate good, conſtantly thus to determine, let the earth rather firſt ſwallowe me vp (as the Poet ſaith) and let mee rather bee accurſed for my brethren, then that by me, and for my credit ſake even one of theſe little ones ſhould be offended and kept from comming to Chriſt, and abiding in Chriſt my Sauiour. Verily let what will of my eſtimation goe to wracke, who am a Chriſtian, let me be trampled vnder all mēs feete, ſo that by my fact, I take nothing from Chriſt, from his body, no not the leſt thing.

               And that you my brethren are thus determined and reſolved bending all your counſels to this end;   I am as ſtrōgly perſwaded, as he that is moſt. But the end which you have in common, alas for griefe, in this particular caſe (pardon if I ſpeake more freely, for yee would have me to ſpeak) from it yee ſeeme to have erred. For herein, if I ſee anie thing, the contemplation of your cauſe hath deceyved you, which thing I truſt yee your ſelves without doubt will marke if ye would goe a little from that your particular ſenſeA cauſa veſtra. from your cauſe.
            I have ſhewed that there is ſome errour in that end. Let vs come to the fact. In the fact yee frame a purgation of your ſelues. That thing is denyed to none, if there be cauſe, if meaſure, if place, if time. But where fore with mee brethren, who doe neither heare theſe accuſations of yours; neither if I ſhould heare them, would I receive them raſhly? Wherefore in publick? where yee knowe that it falleth out for the moſt part, that they who purge them ſelues, before they be accuſed, eyther bewray thēſelues, or raiſe ſuſpiciōs againſt themſelues more eaſely thē they can afterward waſh away. Yee knowe that the publicke voice is neither a iuſt iudge oftentimes, nor at any time almoſt a lawfull Iudge; ſo greatly doth evil preuaile and beare ſway in the publick. Therefor yee appeale to theſe Iudges, who can neither iudge, not take knowledge: finally, they are not onely no Iudges, but not ſo much as witneſſes: ſo the private cauſe is not furthered, and the publique is many waies hindered. Ye will ſay thē, who ſhall bee? What judges, what witneſſes ſhal we call vpon? Your owne preface ſhall anſwere yee for me. For whē, ye pronūce that ye have foūd a place of reſt by the mercy of God in theſe places (ye doe acknowledge I thinke your owne words) ye plainely ſignifie two things. One, that if ye have found a place of reſt, ye ſhall doe wiſely, if ye doe not ſtirre, where ye may be in quiet. The other that

where you haue a lodging, and a quiet ſeate that there in deed you muſt receiue the iudgement of your doctrine and faith, if ye will have the ſame lawfully knowne and approoued. Ye are in a Church furniſhed with the ſervants of God, whoſe pietie, learning, and brotherly loue to the members of Chriſt good men doe know. It is an vnlawfull courſe verily, to omit thoſe among whom yee are and to call upon an other Church, or the whole publik ſtate, Aut Academiam hanc.or this Vniverſity, or me who am a weake member therein, either in part, or in common. This order is godly, iuſt, lawfull, and tendeth to peace, and edification, which you ought firſt, modeſtly to have regarded, and to which I being a weake brother, am bounden by brotherly duetie, to recall my brethren, that goe aſtray, and not to be caried headlong, and to ruſh vpon the knowledge of things by this meanes offred; beſides all equitie and good order. Till ye ſhall doe this, I admoniſh, exhort, pray, and beſeech by the moſt ſacred & holy name of Chriſt, that ye would not call vpon me, neither any other, neither the publick it ſelf: for by this prepoſterous courſe (as we may ſo ſay) ye do not disburthen your ſelues, as ye thinke, of enuy and blame (if there be any) but ye doe with ſuſpition and praejudice burthen your owne cauſe, Cui ego quidē nullū praejudiciū facio, religioſe dico coram Domino.which I verily do not preiudice at all, I ſpeak it religiouſly before the Lord. Let them ſpeake firſt, with whom yee ſoiourne, whom yee deny not to be your brethren. But if peraduenture they ſhall not ſatisfie you, or yee ſhall not ſatisfie them, then let a new courſe be taken by lawfull order▪ This no good man will denie, but till this be attempted, it will be vnprofitable to you, and hurt full to the Church, to take another courſe. But neither I, nor my Colleagues, nor other wiſe men, will euer be ſo vnwiſe as to preuēt or take this thing out of the hands of them, to whom the knowledge thereof doth of right appertaine. And ſo much of the doctrine.
            I come to the accuſation which yee uſe againſt the Church of England, as ye write. In this accuſation beloued brethren, I doe louingly entreat you, that yee would not take it in ill part, if I doe admoniſh yee of a few things which I thinke, I may of right doe. Firſt, what need is there, that yee ſhould accuſe them? Yee haue giuen place, yee haue (as wee may ſo ſpeake) paſſed ouer into another Court: Wherefore you haue giuen place, no body deſireth to know, or doth trouble you. If wrong be done you in England (that I may grant there was done: it belongeth not to me,Vt dem 
                     •
                  iriſſe factā. to affirme or deny who haue not knowne it) yet this iniury hath ceaſed to proſequute you being departed from them. What compelleth you to be mooued, and to take vpon you, the burthen

of accuſation? Why are yee not quiet being without the daunger of any hurt? Why doe yee not rather paſſe ouer the iniury that is paſt? Why doe yee not beare it (if there be yet any) in ſilence and hope, rather then to mooue that which is in reſt? It is plainely a Chriſtian part, if thou beare it, and a prudent part, if thou abſtaine from ſtirring the evill that is well appeaſed, an impotent thing, if thou doe contrariwiſe.Impotens.
            
            And to what end I pray you is it? To the end that you might purge your ſelues? But here is no man that doth repeate anew, or lay theſe accuſations againſt you. Wherefore ſerueth this purgatiō? that yee may be euen with them againſt whom yee cōplaine? But this is not the part of a Chriſtian. I doe not thinke that this is your meaning. Is it to reforme them? This indeed is an holy endeuour. But if yee could not doe this when yee were preſent, cōſider what yee can doe when yee are abſent. But firſt of all conſider with your ſelues, by what meanes yee take this way, namely to accuſe to me, to others, to the publike, in the theatre of the Church, in the circle of the world▪ Ah beloued brethren, was it euer heard of, that any priuate man (to ſay nothing of a great communitie) was euer amended by this courſe Further conſider I pray you before whom yee bring theſe things. I will ſpeak of my ſelfe, to whom alone yee would commit this your little booke; I know not whether in this your little booke yee call upon me, as an interceſſor, or examiner, or a Iudge. For if as an interceſſor, were it not better that your cōplain
                  •
               s were kept ſecret, then layed open (which tendeth to reproch) and the Church of Chriſt, innumerable ſoules, weake, ſtrangers, to be beaten with the types of your impreſſion. It is moſt manifeſt, that they againſt whom yee deale, wil be more prouoked Hoc gravi aculeo.by this grieuous ſting If as an examiner, by what right can I doe it? who haue no lawful authority from God, from the Church, from the Magiſtrate, or frō both the parties: neither if it ſhould be committed, would I eaſily accept it; I am ſo privie to my ſelfe, of my owne inſufficiencie; for who am I? or what am I? that I ſhould be able, throughly to ſee euery particular thing, concerning you, and them, which are required to a iuſt examination. And this the right courſe of examination doth require, otherwiſe (as Seneca wiſely ſaith) he that judgeth one party being not heard, albeit he iudgeth that which is right, yet he is vniuſt. Yee are not a little deceiued in this your iudgement beloued brethren: Yee almoſt do me an iniury, when ye call me to be a buſie body, or think that I wil take upon me the part of an examiner, or (that which is more ſubject to envie and farre from duetie) of a Iudge. And brethrē, that which I ſay of my ſelfe,

thinke that is the anſwere of the other brethrenQui vbiuis locorum ſunt. which are any where els in Churches and Vniverſities. No wiſe man will raſhly goe downe theſe ſteps, or clime vp to this ſeate of judgement. In deed concerning your faith and doctrine ſomething may be ſaid, if you expound it, and if the thing be done in order. But touching the accuſatiō of your coū
               treymen and of mattets paſſed to and fro; no wiſe man by my conſent, wil,Hac lege. on this condition take vpon him the burthen of iudging.
            And for Gods ſake, conſider the event of this fact. For I pray you whom would it profit if that were done which yee deſire? Certainly neither would it profit you nor thē, nor theſe with whom ye ſoiourne, nor the Church of God. Contrariwiſe whom would it not hurt? This thing would ſet you more on fire:Res iſta vos magis inflamma

Ye will marvalle perhaps at that which I ſay, and yet it is ſo. For you doe ſo require my iudgement as you doe alſo with all require the iudgement of all Vniverſities and Students. If you requeſt this in common; then you doe not deſire that I ſhould doe it alone: but if particularly, doe you thinke that any of vs will be ſo mad, that when the judgement of ſo many good men and diligence is deſired, ſome one Palamon ſhould take vpon him the chiefeſt parts: and ſhould by him ſelfe ſpeake of that thing, which is required of ſo many as learned, yea better learned, and better furniſhed with pi

               But now of the third thing what ſhal I ſay?Ipſi opinor, fratres chariſſimi, animadvertitis, ſi de antecedentibus illis duobus capitibus nec poſſum ea lege, nec debeo reſpōſum dare, id planè iniquū fore ſi de ea concluſione, &c. your ſelves I think, beloved brethren, do mynd that if I cannot on this condition, neyther ought, to give anſwer concerning the two points a foreſaid▪ it would be vtterly vnjuſt if I ſhould as yet determine any thing on eyther ſide towching the cōcluſion which you draw frō thence, that is, from thoſe premiſſes. But I verily ſuſpēd my iudgemēt, brethrē I ſuſpend my iudgemēt in this cauſe, even as God & nature, & reaſon, and al lawes command me to do. Ye know I think the cauſes by theſe things which ye haue now read, & ſhal learne beſides by other things which God ſhal miniſter vnto you (I hope) by the ſpirit of trueth and wiſdome. I ought not to iudge with my ſelfe of matters vnknowne, at leaſt not ſo evident, neither yet with ſuch forward boldneſſe to pronoūce among you or others, the matter being not ſufficiently manifeſt to my ſelfe. God knoweth and iudgeth,Cui ſtant. to whom ſtand or fall as many as are his ſervants. Otherwiſe I truſt yee are not ignorāt that there are three things which euē frō the verie infancie of the Church, the holy fathers would haue to be diſtinguiſhed by the word of God, among the people of God, namely, faith or doctrine, converſation or manners, and the order of diſcipline. And all wiſe men haue taught this with one conſent, and delivered it to poſteritie, that where the foundation of the truth of doctrine remaineth, which is the piller of ſaluation, although with moſt corrupt manners and diſcipline, there the Church remaineth, & that no man ought raſhly to ſeparate himſelfe from that Church (whiles he may tarry in it without ſhip wracke of faith and conſcience) or take from it the name of a Church, eſpecially ſeeing euery Church conſiſteth of Paſtors and flocke, which if ſome Paſtors or Prelates trouble, yet it is vnmeete that this name either ſhould be taken away from the other Paſtors, which Chriſt doth witneſſe by the doctrine of truth, or from the flocke which Chriſt hath purchaſed with his owne bloode, and doth daily ſanctifie with the waſhing of the newe birth by the worde. This ought to be ſufficient for you if any thing have offended you at home,quòd jam. &c. that now the fatherly & mercifull providence of God hath provided for you elſewhere. Certainely whiles yee inueigh againſt thoſe Churches, yee ſhal make that your cauſe neuer the better, neither more probable with good men: which thing if yee have not yet conſidered and conceived by my aduiſe and counſell, and by the admonition of thoſe which wiſh you wel, experience it ſelfe at laſt (God grant it be not to late, and he informe you in good) will prooue all th
                  •
               ſe things vnto you. For by the trueth of doctrine, holineſſe of life, by the worke of faith and patience, and by the dueties of charitie euen towards them of whome yee profeſſe that ye are wronged, yee ſhal rather approove your ſelves and your cauſe, thē by outcryes and publiſhing of writings, euen as our Sauiour is ſaide to bring iudgement to victorie not by filling the ſtreetes with ſhouting and clamours, but by blowing gently into the ſmoking flax and tender handling the bruiſed reede.
            Which thinges ſeeing they be ſo, I beſeech you moſt louing brethrē in Chriſt by that moſt holi name of Chriſt which ye profeſe, by thoſe bowels

mercie, wherewith Chriſt hath embraced vs frō on high, that yee would thinke of another courſe, that yee would take another way to ſalvation, to edificatiō, to peace.Si conſenſio eſt. If there be conſent, ſhake not your faith, which is not to be winnowed againe by new reaſons. This courſe is ſuſpitious. But if it muſt needs be ſifted, let it ſuffice you that it be firſt approved by thoſe ſervants of God among whome yee dwell: this is certainnly a lawfull courſe: Forgiue the former iniuries if any have beene, by Chriſtian charitie to them from whom yee have received the ſame, & hide them frō others by Chriſtiā wiſdome. There is no feare, that by ſo doing yee ſhould Rumpamini. be burſt: God will enlarge your harts by the ſpirite of charitie moſt cō
               modiouſly. Looke to your ſelues that overcomming al ſharpneſſe and al bitterneſſe of minde yee may be acceptable to Chriſt and profitable to the Church, and that Odor ſuaviſſimus. the ſweet odour of your pietie may be ſpread in ſpeach, in life, in order to all the godly without the ſtench of enmitie and ſchiſme. Iudge not that yee be not iudged: But abſtaine from thoſe heavie determinations and concluſions (as they call them) againſt othermen, neither labour either to get Abetters or partakers in that your former iudgement (which would be ſaide in you to be a ſpice of faction in them of imprudencie, or elſe to drawe them to an vnſeaſonable, vncivill, inconvenient and dangerous deliuerie of opinions.

And it would be a greate indignitie by clamours and writings to brede in them ſuſpicions and ſiniſter opinions, eyther of your ſelves or of thoſe your adverſaries (as you count them) or els of both. Finally pitie the Church of Chriſt, which verily it is not comely, nor expedient neither in any caſe tolerable amōg ſo many and greeuous wounds which areVniverſè, vniverſally, or, every where univerſally given vnto it, to be further galled with this particular wound. So let God almightie loue you and Ieſus Chriſt that moſt mercifull Lord, and our Sauiour be mercifull vnto you. And if I ſhall be able to doe any good in the publicke cauſe and yours, aſſure your ſelves that I will ſpare no diligence, no labour, no paines, that you with vs and all togither may be filled with ſāctimony (without which none ſhal ſe God) with the good things of the Lord in his houſe, and before his face. And the God of peace which hath raiſed from the dead our Lord Ieſus that great ſheepeheard of the ſheepe, by the blood of the eternall couenant, make you perfect in euery good worke to doe his will, working in you, that which is acceptable in his ſight by Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be glorie for ever and ever, Amen.

                  Yours in the Lord Francis Iunius.
            
         
         
            
            The anſwer to the Letter aforeſaid.
            
               To the Reverend and learned Mr. Francis Iunius, our beloved brother in Chriſt, At Leyden in Holland.
            
            
               GRace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour. Reverend Sr. and beloved brother in Chriſt / we have lately received your letter / which you ſent vnſealed to the Miniſters of the Dutch and frēch Churches / that it might firſt be read of thē / and them be delyvered to vs. We have alſo read and weighed it / and thought it meet to wryte agayne / partly to thank you that vouched ſafe to write vnto vs: partly to ſatisfy you (if we can) in ſome thinges wherein we ſee you are miſtaken: In the wryting wherof / we humbly requeſt that ſpeaking freely that which the thing it ſelf requireth you would take it in good part / as you are woōt. Many thinges indeed you have wrytten which we do willingly acknowledg and conſent therein with you. Thoſe we will not touch at all. The reſt we will proſequute in the ſame order / as by your ſelf 
                  •
               hey are propounded.
            Whereas there was a litle booke exhibited vnto you by one of vs / it is not ſo to be takē / as if you were called vpō 
               alone or apart from others. For the brother which delyvered you the booke certified vs / that this paſſed betwene you / that by you it ſhould be communicated with your Colleagues the governours of that Vniverſity / and that you tooke vpon you to do it. Now if you have ſo done / how is it that you alone wryte back againe? why alſo do you ſo often repeat and ſeeme to reprehend that you / you (we ſay) alone / apart / are called vpon? If you have not done it / mynde then on whome the blame lyeth that it is not communicated with thē in that Vniverſity / to whome by vs it was dedicated. And we do now agayne entreat you / that being myndfull of your promyſe you would performe it: that ſo you with the other learned and godly men and brethren there / may eyther convynce our fayth and cauſe of errour / or els together with vs conted for this ſayth once gyven to the Saints. The one of theſe we take it muſt needes be donne. And we gather it by comparing together Iam. 5.19.12. with Iude ver. 3. This alſo is the very thing which we did deſire and ſtill do deſire in that Epiſtle dedicatory. And let theſe thinges once ſpoken / ſuffyce (we pray you) for the crimination of calling on you apar
                     •
                  , which in this letter of yours you have ſo oftē objected and repeated.
            Next you propound three tinges to be conſidered in the booke it ſelf / of which you promyſe to ſpeake / briefly and brotherly / what you thinke.
            
               1. The firſt head (you ſay) is of the doctrine, which we profeſſe in our booke. Be it ſo indeed. Here we expected (becauſe you purpoſe to wryte of the doctrine we profeſſe) that you would have diſcuſſed the articles of our fayth / and reproved the errours (if there be any) by the light of Gods word. And who would not have expected this? But behold / there is not a word of the doctrine and fayth it ſelf. What may this meane? Is it becauſe your ſelf beleeu this faith to be trew-sound groūded on the word of God and agreable thervnto? If ſo why thē wryting theſe thinges / do you not profeſſe it? Why do you diſſemble it? ſpecially / whē you heare that this fayth is traduced as ſchiſme / as hereſy? but you ſee perhaps that in the doctrine of faith we erre from the truth. If it be ſo / why then wryte you / and yet ſhew not the errours? why do you not (as much as in you is) bring into the way ſuch as do erre? Do not whē requeſt is made that the errours may be ſhewed by the light of the holy Scripture▪ Certainly your godlynes perſwadeth otherwiſe: yea / God himſelf requireth otherwiſe. Iam. 5.19.20.
            
            
               Yet now when you touch not the doctrine it ſelf / what is it that you wryte in this behalf? Even this only / that you would perſwade we have erred herein that we have publyſhed the confesſion of our faith. Firſt of al this concerneth the maner / not the matter it ſelf. But yet let vs weigh your reaſons: If (ſay you) there be a certayne conſent of doctrine: then there was no need that we ſhould ſet forth a new Confeſſion in this agreement of holy and ancient doctrine. Doe you indeed ſpeak as you thinke? How is it then that ſome while ſynce / when the Germane and French Churches had before publyſhed their Confeſſions of fayth / yet afterward the Belgick / Scotiſh / and other Churches ſet forth theirs alſo / notwitſtanding that they agreed with them in the holy and anncient doctrine? Yea tell vs (we pray you) what you think of that godly and learned Mr. Beza his pryvate Confeſſion of fayth lately publyſhed? Not to ſpeake of many other wrytten and divulged by many of the martyrs alſo / in their ſeverall ages. Do not all theſe agree in the holy and anncyent doctrine of Godlynes? Or ſhould not therfore theſe Confeſſions have bene publyſhed? What ſoever you ſhall ſay for them / mynd the ſame alſo as ſpoken for vs. Secondly you ſay, if there be any diſſention in doctrine, that ought not to be diſſembled, &c. But what is this to vs / who have playnely ſhewed and reckned vp the thinges wherein we diſſent from the Church of England / with whom we have to do in this behalf? Neyther that only / but have alſo in our Confeſſion not obſcurely ſignified / concerning the thinges wherein the other Churches of this city and ours as yet do not agree.
            After theſe thinges / you come to diſcuſſe the end and fact of our publyſhing this Confeſſion. Touching the end, we have ſhewed it in the epiſtle and preface ſet before the booke it ſelf. And we anſwer further / that we did this to the ſame end / that all the reformed Churches of late did publyſh theirs. For proof wherof / let the preface of the Harmony of Confeſſions / compared with ours / ſpeak for vs. If you take away the reaſons by both alleadged / we yeeld. But if you cannot / then ſee whether both here and other where often in this letter you do not through our ſydes ſtrike at all theſe Churches lykewiſe. Our cauſe and cleering, we commyt to God and to all godly that love the truth. Such as before knewe not our cauſe they may now by this meanes have knowledg therof. Such as be enemyes of God / of the Church / of the truth / have nothing by this book of ours / wherof to rejoyce. They will rather be grieved when thus they ſhall ſee Antichriſt that man of ſynne to be more and more diſcovered / whom the Lord in the end will wholy conſume and abolyſh / with the ſpirit of his mouth in the teſtimony (not in the ſilence) of his ſervants. 2. Theſ. 2.8. with Rev. 12.11. and 14 6 7 8. and 20.4. Fynally / ſuch as be weak and by reaſon of the ſtink of ſchiſmes know not the true body of Chriſt whervnto they ſhould joyne themſelves / they may by this meanes be better inſtructed and induced more certainly to know and imbrace the true Church and fayth of Chriſt. Thus deſyre we that the publyck good of the Church be holye forward / that Chriſt may have the preeminence over all. And thus have we ſpoken of the end / in which as yet we ſee not any miſtaking or errour.
            Touching the fact, we anſwer in lyke maner as before concerning the end. Yea and the thinges which here you bring / for not doing it in publyck / you may vrge the very ſame lykewiſe againſt all the reformed Churches / againſt Athanaſius, Origen, Auguſtine, Tertullian, and others of the fathers / againſt Zuinglius, Luther, Calvine, Beza, and many other of theſe ages / godly men / and divers of

them alſo Martyrs of Ieſus Chriſt: who have ſet forth in publyck their Confeſſions of fayth private their apologies complaynts / diſputations / yea and their letters concerning matters in religion publyckly controverted. But theſe things perhaps came not in your mynd / whiles there was before your eyes only the contemplation of our particular cauſe: which thing your ſelf (we truſt) will perceive / if you turne your eyes a lytle from vs vnto others approved by your ſelf. Moreover howſoever the evill (wherof you wryte) do prevayte in publyck: yet alwayes and every where wiſdome is juſtified of her children / as Chriſt hath taught / Mat. 11.16.19. And this ſhall ſuffice vs and all that are godly. Laſtly / in a caſe of ſuch weight and neceſſity / who ſhould rather be called vpon then the ſtudents of the holy Scriptures in Chriſtian vniverſityes? Who (we pray you) are eſteemed to be of better or ſounder judgment? Whome doth it more concerne to take knowledg / of the truth and errours in religion? Who ſhould better inſtruct in the truth / or convince falſhoold? And to conclude / who can or ought to attend more to the diſcuſſing of theſe things?
            But you object / that ſeeing we have here found place of reſt, here alſo we muſt receive the judgment of our doctrine and fayth, if we will have the ſame lawfully knowen and approved, &c. Here come many things to be conſidered. Firſt what if the reſt and breathing / which here we enjoye / come vnto vs / not by the Miniſters (of whome you ſpeak) but by the Magiſtrats: which we do alwayes and every where acknowledg with thanckes. Secondly what if theſe miniſters (men indeed learned and wiſe) ſhould be of the ſame mynd with you / that they would not heare or ſpeake any thing concerning our fayth and cauſe: inaſmuch as they would not be eyther interceſſours, or examiners, or Iudges? Furthermore / what if our Confeſſion of fayth have ben exhibited to them above three yeares ſynce / that by them it might eyther be approved / or the errours (if there be any) convinced? What if ſome of them have denounced vs as hereticks and ſchiſmaticks? What if they have received certayne articles full of lyes and ſclaunders / ſpread abroad againſt vs / and yet to this daye have not gyven vs a copy of them / no though they were deſyred? What if vpon occaſion offered we have dealt with them touching certaine corruptions yet remayning in their Churches / which notwithſtanding they would not ſo much as acknowledg? And finally / what if we after the concealing and not regarding of all theſe thinges / have now agayne this laſt yeare delyvered them the Confeſſion of our fayth in wryting / before it was put forth in print? You ſee what we could anſwer in this behalf: but we would rather have burned theſe thinges in forgetfulnes / if you had not ſo vrged vs as from you they might not now be concealed. Pardon you therfore and let them alſo (we intreat) pardon vs / that we ſpeak freely: for you would have vs ſpeak / yea you conſtreyne vs againſt our will to wryte theſe things / which we would have covered in ſilence / hoping hereafter for better. Beſydes theſe / we anſwer alſo that in the preface before our Confeſſion is ſignified / that not here only but almoſt every where we are traduced as heretickes / and ſchiſmaticks: and that therfore it concerned vs / to declare our fayth and cauſe not to theſe only but vnto all. The very thing which before vs on lyke occaſion (as is aforeſaid) both dyvers of the ffathers have don of old / and in later wines almoſt all the reformed Churches / and of the Martyrs not a few.
            And hitherto of your reaſons alleadged againſt the publyſhing of our

our fayth: Which how weak they are now judg your ſelf. But ſuppoſe they were ſtrong / and that therfore herein we had erred / that our Confeſſion came forth in publyck: yet now it is publyſhed / the errours (if any be found in it) are certeynly to be ſhewed and convinced by the word of God.
            Otherwiſe you may eaſily gather that we ſhall be more cōfirmed in this fayth. And ſeing you (Learned Sr.) do purpoſely wryte cōcerning the Doctrine which we profeſſe / and yet ſhew not any one errour in the Doctrine: conſider wel what you have done. Will you be ready to help them who erre (as you think) in the manner and circumſtāces? and will you afford no help at all in the matter and fayth it ſelf? Far be this from you from your godlynes learning / wiſdome / charity. And thus much of the firſt poynt which you noted concerning doctrine.
            
               2 The ſecond head is of the fact wherof (as you ſay) we accuſe the Englyſh Churches. Here alſo we expected / that you would have diſcuſſed thoſe fower poynts / which are particularly rehearſed in the preface of this book / and which we ſhewed to be done and vſed by / them dayly in their divine worſhip: for which alſo we teſtifyed that we are baniſhed and have departed from them. But of theſe neyther / have you not one word And yet this was the ſpecyall fact / which we noted for to be conſidered in that Church. That other of the Prelats tyranny and perſecution of vs / we touched but by the way and in a few wordes. We marvell therfore / yea and greatly marvell that theſe thinges which directly concerne the matter and cauſe it ſelf / ſhould thus every where be let paſſe by you / who yet pretend to bring into the way ſuch as do erre. But les vs ſee nevertheles what the thinges are which you do here ſo much vrge.
            The firſt is / that thoſe Churches from which we have departed, ſhould not by vs be accuſed About the word accuſation we will not contend: Onely this we ſay / we vſe it no
                  •
                (that we remember) except whē we treat of our owne cauſe who by them are accuſed of hereſy ſchiſme ſedition etc. Of which for aſmuch as we are accuſed among them / here and every where: what good man will deny vnto vs place of defence: But you ſay / no man deſyreth to know why we came thence, and that the injury alſo hath left to proſequute vs being departed from them How theſe things eſcaped you we marvell. For in both of them you wryte other wiſe then the thing is. For both many do dayly deſier to know why we came thence / and the injury hath proſequuted vs being departed / into this place to this very day Of the former we need cyte no witneſſes: for they are almoſt infinite. Of the latter / beſydes the Latine bookes publyſhed at home by our owne contreymen / beſydes the libels which they have ſparſed againſt vs in this city beſydes the ſclaunders wherewith then do alſo purſue vs every where: beſydes all theſe (we ſay) the Miniſters them ſelves of the Churches Dutch and Frēch both here at Amſterdam and at Dordrecht are able to teſtifye▪ they have received (as we ſaid afore) certeyne articles full of lyes and ſclaunders / wrytten againſt vs / and yet ſtill they have them for ought we know▪ Moreover / if none of theſe things had fallē out opēly before the world yet who knoweth not that Antichriſts retinew (ſuch as be the Prelats) do ſtill reſemble the nature and conditions of the Dragon / who out of his mouth caſt waters like a flood after the woman / that he might cauſe her to be caryed away of the flood whom being preſent he could not devoure. Rev. 12. and 13 chap.
            
            As for that you annexe of concealing injuryes, it hath ben obſerved by vs / as much as we could. For neyther have we in particular related them / neyther can we if we would. We have noted only in generall / that theſe Prelats have done the very things / which the Scripture foretold ſhould by the Beaſt and Antichriſt be commytted Neyther are we in this kind of writing eyther the firſt / or alone. Thus heretofore have many of the ſervants of God wrytten / who in their ſeverall countries have ben many wayes ve
                  •
               ed by Antichriſt. Neyther that only / but they have alſo noted downe the particuler perſons / names / places / tymes / 

martyrdomes / cauſes / actions / injuryes. Search (if you pleaſe) the eccleſiaſticall writers almoſt of everye age: ſearch the Acts and momments of the martyrs / in this countrey in ours / in Scotland / in France / in the other countryes almoſt all here about: yea ſearch the Acts of the Apoſtles / and ſee if ſuch particular hiſtoryes be not there alſo recorded. Yet further / tell vs (we pray you) if this courſe had ben held by all / which you ſeem to exact of vs: from whence then could you or any other have that knowledg and evidence, as now is had / of the fulfilling (throughout ſeverall ages / of thoſe prophecyes which are in the Scriptures / of the Beaſt / of the falſe Prophet / of Antichriſt / of his myſtery / exaltation / tyranny / marchants diſcovery / fall / etc. How ſhould from their owne Acts / the adverſaryes mouthes be ſo ſtopped / as now we ſee / heare and read / is dayly done by the martyrs and ſervants of Chriſt? Laſtly / how could your ſelf and other learned men have ſo expounded that divine book of the Revelation (not to ſpeak of other Scriptures lykewiſe interpreted) as you have now already done / which great fruit / and gratulation of all the godly?
            Of the end which here againe you vrge / we have ſpoken both before in this letter / and in the epiſtles prefixed to the book it ſelf. Adde herevnto / that if the Prelats and other adverſaryes of the truth be not by theſe and the lyke wrytinges amended / they ſhall yet doubtleſſe be made the more vnexcuſeable. The viſard alſo by which they have deceyved you (as it ſeemeth) and almoſt all others / was to be pulled of. But this could not be donne for the knowledg of all (as was mee
                  •
               ) otherwiſe then by publyck wryting. To omytt others / we appeale vnto your conſcience (learned S.) whether you did think the eſtate of that Church and of thoſe Prelats to be ſuch in any meaſure touching their Antichriſtian conſtitution / leitourgy / miniſtery / Hierarchy (which your ſelf acknowledg to be that other beaſt / in Rev. 13, 11.18.) as now for certeyne you heare and ſee it in that book as it were paynted out before your eyes. But of theſe things ynough is ſayd in the book it ſelf Surely theſe and the lyke their vnfruitfull workes of darknes / were to be reprooved / not diſſembled / not allowed:Eph. 5.11. Reb. 18.6▪7 Ier. 50.14.
                eſpecyally ſeing they are ſo ſtiffely by them retayned / defended / vrged: and that vnder a pretence of the Goſpell / with which they have no more agreement then darknes hath with light / Beliall with Chriſt. Neyther is this to take vp burthens of Accuſations, but to take away the viſard of Antichriſtian apoſtaſy / and to witnes the truth of Ieſus Chriſt againſt Antichriſt. which duty our Lord and Saviour Chriſt requireth of you / of vs / of all the godly: the Lord (we ſay) who in theſe latter tymes hath begunne to diſcover that lawles man of ſinne / and will at length conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth / by the word of the teſtimony of his ſervants. So far of is it / that they ſhould be accounted buſy bodyes, which performe this duty to Chriſt: or that we herein have don you any iniury. So far of alſo is it / that we ſhould think what you ſpeak of your ſelf, the ſame to be anſwered vs by the reſt of the bretheren that are any where els in Churches, in Vniverſityes. Not to ſpeak of others / we know that Mr. Beza that worthy ſervant of God hath in cauſes not much vnlyke anſwered otherwiſe. But of this matter more herafter. In the meane tyme (that we alſo may deale ſyncerely and brotherly with you) mynd we pray you / whether you have not done your ſelf iniury / whiles you have climed into this ſeate ſo confident
                  ••
                to pronounce that of others▪ wherof (as we think) you cannot any way have certaine knowledg: yea whiles you alone determyne of that matter / which (to uſe your owne wordes) requireth ſerious conſultation and holy communication.
            
            Touching the event, we commit it to God / who (we certeynly hope) will worck al theſe things for good both to vs / and to thē by whom we are exiled and to theſe amonge whom we ſojorne / and to the Church of God every where. And to whom (we pray you) would it not be good / if that were done / which we deſ

ſelves, if we erre / let the righteous ſmyte and reprove vs / it ſhalbe a benefyt and precious oyntment vnto vs. For our adverſaries, if they be the more eſtraunged / it ſhalbe their own fault not ours / nor theirs that ſhall godlyly and freely teſtifie what they ſee in this cauſe: And who knoweth / whether by this meanes they may be brought to conſider more then heretofore both of the vnlawfull conſtitution of that Church / and of their outragious cruelty: and therevpon ſeriouſly endevour a godly redreſſing of the former / and an vtter repreſſing of the latter? For the good among whom we ſojourne, they ſhall have better knowledg of our fayth and cauſe: they may alſo grow vp together more ſtrongly in the truth of the Goſpell / whiles thus they are ſtirred vp more carefully to endevour that the corruptions wherewith their Churches yet are faulty may be duly abolyſhed / and whiles ſuch as are ſeduced by the errours of the Papiſts / Anabaptiſts / and other hereticks troubling theſe Churches are vpon this occaſion drawne from ſuch eſtate and ſtirred vp to ſearch / knowe / and embrace the truth of Goſpell. Fynally for the whole Church, we hope it ſhall hence alſo receive much profyt / if this fayth and cauſe (which now a long tyme hath ben condempned for ſchiſme and hereſy) if alſo that Antichriſtian Apoſtaſy (which now a long tyme vnder the viſard of godlynes hath deceived the world in the myſtery of iniquity) if theſe things we ſay / being of ſo great moment / be examyned and diſcuſſed by the canon of the Scriptures / of ſo many and ſo worthy men furnyſhed with learning / godlynes judgment / wiſdome. And thus much of the ſecond poynt which was concerning the fact.
            The third (you ſay) is of the concluſion inferred vpon comparing together the doctrine and fact aforeſaid. Here firſt you affirme / you with
                     ••
                  ould your ſelf in ſuſpence in this cauſe. Be it ſo. It is God that can reveale this alſo vnto you / and perſwade your conſcience by his Spirit and word. Then you annex ſome things concerning the doctrine and conſent of the fathers and all wiſe men in all ages: but you propound them ſo doubtfully that (as touching our cauſe) we cannot perceive what your meaning is. Your wordes may ſo be vnderſtood / as we moſt willingly conſent with you in this matter: agayne / they may be ſo taken / as we diſſent from you not a lytle nor without cauſe. We are perſwaded / that ſeparation ſhould not be made from any Church eyther raſhly / or at all ſo long as we may remayne with ſound fayth and cōſcience. You muſt therfore ſpeak more playnely / what you think of our ſeparation if you ſuppoſe we have erred in this behalf: all thoſe things being diſcuſſed by the word of God / which we have menc

In the meane tyme heare and ponder well (we pray you) what Mr. Beza that learned man and well deſerving of the Church of Chriſt hath wrytten and publyſhed ſome while ſince concerning this queſtion.

But touching that which you ſpeak of Chriſt our Saviour how he brought iudgment to victory, not by crying out and filling the ſtreets with clamours, but by blowing ſoftly vpon the ſmoking flax and handling tenderly the bruſed reed. This we do indeed moſt willingly acknowledg / and pray that we may alwayes followe this his moſt ſacred example. Nevertheleſſe / this alſo muſt be remembred that Chriſt dealt after one maner with the weack (of whome here the ſpeach is) after an other with the * Scribes and Phariſees and other the like ſworne enemyes of the truth:Mat. 16.3.4 and 23. cap. ſuch as at this day be the Prelats and their complices: which who is it that doth not know? who is it that doth not acknowledg.

            Which things being ſo we humbly beſech you (reverend and beloved Sr. by that moſt holy name of Chriſt / which you profeſſe / by the mercyes of God wherewith he hath loved vs in Chriſt / that you would thnik of another courſe (then ſuch as yet it ſeemeth you allow) that you would take an other way for diſcovering and deſtroying the defection of Antichriſt for ſetting forward the ſalvation edificatiō and peace both of vs and others. Hold on to defend the true fayth (as now a good while you have done with great praiſe and fruit of the godly) and diſcover errours: maynteyne good cauſes and forſake evill: Strive for Chriſt and the truth of his Goſpell / and fight againſt Antichriſt and the remnants of his Apoſtaſy. Let it be manifeſt to all / what your mynd and judgment is / not only concerning the fayth of Chriſt / but alſo concerning the myſtery / Apoſtaſy / and iniquity of Antichriſt: ffinally / as touching our ſelves in ſpecyall / if you wryte agayne / we do humbly and earneſtly entreat / if any where we have erred

in our fayth and chuſe / that you vouchſafe to ſhew it vs by the light of Gods word▪ Otherwiſe it wil be ſuſpected / ſeing you beſtow ſo much paynes in diſcuſſing theſe things which concerne the māner and not the matter it ſelf that eyther you do diſſemble your iudgment (what ſoever it be) or that in very deed you are of the ſame mynd with vs: ſpecially ſeing now you have wrytten / that you do not any preiudice at all to our cauſe, and have ſpoken this religiouſly before the Lord.

            YOur Letters (loving Brethren) I received yeſterday and read. If your meſſēger had ſhewed mee before, to whome, or whither I ſhould have written, the matter had beene other wiſe caried: but I ſought and wayted a whole moneth, being vncertaine to whom I might ſend. If any thing were done otherwiſe then we would, it was your owne fault. That ye giue no place to falſe ſuſpition, I did nothing without the knowledge of my brethrē and Colleagues. To you I gave counſell: if it pleaſe you not, you may let it alone for me: it becommeth not vs to be contentious: for it is not our cuſtome, nor the cuſtome of the Churches of God. Now that Meſſenger of yours ſpake onely to me, without letters, and called not on any of my Colleages: What thē is the blame you lay vpō me? Nemo vetuit ut ſolus conſilium darem. none forbad me to give counſel alone. You asked indeed about a matter of faith, but wee thought good rather to deale about giving you cōſell. What? if a mā anſwere not according to your preſcript, is it by and by an iniurie? Give vs leave, brethrē, I pray you, to uſe our own iudgement: we thought it fitter to give you counſell, then to make an anſwere to your demaundes, and that this wee might doe vnto you in brotherly dutie. If we might not, Si non licuit nobis, at nos aequiores erimus erga vos: licet per nos abſtinere, literas licet deſcindere, etiam nobis diſſimulaturis. yet will wee bee more indifferent towards yow: you may for vs abſtaine, you may rent the Letters, and we alſo will concele it. I wrote as touching counſell, becauſe I thought ther was need of it. I wrote not of the queſtion, becauſe I thought the time was not for it. Otherwiſe I had neuer thought of you, or your matters, no not ſo much as in my dream: ſo greatly doe I ſhunne to bee a medler in other mēs matters. You will ſay, why w

               s not the time for it? Surely becauſe the matter was not cleere to me, to have beene handled in order, and good maner: Wherunto by giving you counſell, I called you backe. For if you kept good manner and order, yow might hav ſhewed it: if you kept it not, you might have returned vnto it and obſerve it. I knewe nothing at all, either by you, or by any other, which I ſpeake, to the ende that you ſuſpect none that is innocent. Our manner is to make anſwere in order, to them that aske according unto order: if any aske not in order, our manner is to call them backe to order, as is meete: yea if any vrge vs a hundred times beſides order: we will call him backe an hundred times vnto order; or elſe by ſilence take order for our owne quietneſſe and ſecuritie. Will you therefore take the thing in queſtion for graunted: Pardon me

I know it, and I commend it: for eyther they ſeemed and were ſayd to ſtagger in the hands of their perſecutors, or elſe Religione adducti. moved of conſciēce they did it orderly with the conſend and approbation of the Church: but he who writeth with a mind to diſſent, writeth againſt order, and ſifteth the ſoares of the Church againſt the law of charitie. But you profeſſe, that if there be any diſſention, you do not diſſemble it▪ Surely in your confeſſion I ſee no token wherby I may be certainely perſwaded of it. Haue me excuſed: my ſenſes are to dull to ſmell out things that are ſo ſecret. And yet now I thā
               ke you euē for this, that you acknowledge your diſſent in ſome things from the miniſters of the Church of Amſterdam: and I thanke God which moued mee to ſuſpend my iudgement. Therefore I did well who beeing altogether ignorant of your matters, did yet ſo write that I prevented a thing by you diſſembled, (or at leaſt obſcurely ſet down) by whole ſome counſel.
            The end, which is the cleering of your ſelves (although I knew nothing of you) you ſhall ſooner attaine in one day by dealing with the Church wherein you are, then in an hundred yeare (if you ſhould live ſo long) by writing to other ChurchesHuc illuc. hither and thither. You do not yet perſwade me that you have dealt orderly: if we ſticke conſtantly to order, and you diſlike it, at leaſt beare with vs. For whereas you ſay that you are euery where proclaimed heretickes, &c. I knewe nothing of you, neither ſhould yet have knowne any thing if you had held your peace: ſo ſtrongly are my eares ſtopped againſt al rumors. Of the fact of the Engliſh Churches, I have not certaine knowledge: why would you have vs ſpeake? You might have been ſilent as I admoniſhed you by my letters, and will you not let vs be ſo?Vos

You may if ſo be you know the thing ſo well, have the iudgemēt of it with your ſelves: but to publiſh it among the people, to call for abettors of it, and to exact like iudgement of vs you cannot. Keepe your confidence to your ſelves, and leave vs our modeſty, who have reſolved not to ſpeake of other mens matters, except we know them thoroughly. You thinke that other good mē will ſay otherwiſe, but I think better of them who in my perſwaſion are furniſhed with knowledge, skill, and wiſedome from heaven, that they would ſooner ſubſcribe to our modeſtie, then to this

your iudiciall confidence. To looke to the event, is a point of wiſdome: which if you regard not, I pray God the author of all wiſedome to give you diſcretion.
            Touching the concluſion, (Bretheren) what ſhall I ſay otherwiſe then I haue ſaid? I verily have reſolved neither for you, nor for any mortall man to bee headie and inconſiderate in iudging: eſpecially when it neither belongeth to me to do it, neither can it bee done with any fruit. If you can doe it rightly, wee doe not hinder you: but let vs who cannot, profeſſe this one thing to you, that we can be no iudges. Touching others whome we knowe, we have ſpoken elſe where: but touching them, becauſe we knowe thē not,Ne adhue quidem dicimus. wee do not yet ſpeak. Cō
               cerning Beza (how excellent a man) that which you often ſay, take heede Brethren, you bee not deceived. He ſpake by way of ſuppoſition, which you expreſſe in your letters: we, becauſe we ſee, and experience doth teach vs, that his wordes being ſpoken by way of ſuppoſition, are vnderſtoode of many as ſpoken ſimply, dare not ſo much as anſwere by way of ſuppoſition. Is this ſuch an hainous and capitall fault with you? bee it farre from you Brethren, bee it farre from you to take that courſe with good men, which God, reaſon, and the times haue taught vs to be daungerous. Raſh and headie iudgements are not to be required, not to bee endured, not to be heard. That God of truth might iuſtly puniſh vs, if caſting a ſide diſcretion (which is moſt needefull in theſe times) wee ſhould anſwere alwayes to all queſtions according to the lawes preſcribed by ſuch as propounde the ſame. Theſe three things according to God and vnder him are a lawe to vs, veritie, charitie, and diſcretion. If any one of theſe bewanting, we are afraid to offend. We crave of you (brethrē) that at leaſt, you woulde leave vs this our religious feare, till all thinges bee made more plaine and eaſie vnto vs: and if you thinke your ſelves more ſtrōg in iudging, beare with vs as with weake ones, til by godly quietnes and holy ſtudie, we may attaine to more high and certaine thinges. That which wee may doe, truely, godlily, brotherly, wiſely, we will neuer be ſlacke to doe, if wee may profite you and the Church of Chriſt. The Lorde furniſh you (beloued Brethren) with his Spirit, and direct you to veritie and charitie in holy wiſedome and faith to the glorie of his name, the edification of his bodie, and obtayning of your owne ſalvation, Amen.

In which you relate many troubles and afflictions which heretofore you have ſuffered for religiō ſake / being purſued by the enemyes of Chriſt and his truth.Vita D.F.

Why then do you that to others / which you would not have done to your ſelf? Why vrge you theſe thinges ſo vnjuſtly againſt this Church of Chriſt and all the members of it▪ which hath ſuffered mo afflictions of all ſortes / mo reproches impriſonments / loſſes / baniſhments deathes / then your ſelf and divers other good men (yea though your troubles were tē tymes doubled) whoſe particular ſtoryes notwithſtanding are wrytten / publyſhed / and approved. But we will let theſe thinges paſſe: for neyther do we lyke this courſe of aunting / diſdayning wynding away from the point in hand ſo often uſed by you in your letters vnworthely: Neyther do we deny but your aflictions were as you have related / heavy and to be lamented which alſo / if you contynew fayth full to the end / the Captaine of our faith and beholder of our warfare will abundantly reward in the heavens even Ieſus Chriſt / to whome we commytt and commend this whole cauſe:

turning it into Engliſh imprinted it, Yet have we not hitherto gyvē vnto any ſo much as a copy eyther of yours or our owne: providing (what we could) for your credyt / ye ſo / as we neglected our owne our ſelves / and were traduced by others / as now by this book publyſhed will appeare vnto all. But perhaps in this matter you purpoſed one thing / he another. Whatſoever it were / now you cannot but ſee / how the Prelats and Prieſts of our countrey do ſo interpret your letters / as if they had bene wrytten againſt the truth of the Goſpell of Chriſt / which we profeſſe / and for defence of the Antichriſtian Apoſtaſy and tyranny / wherein they perſiſt. Which thing we leave vnto you / to be weighed ſeriouſly before the Lord.
            Neyther is it to be omitted / that your private letters are ſet forth in publyck: yours (we ſay) who took it ſo yll that the Cōfeſſion of fayth of this whole Church ſhould be made publyck: whom theſe very letters of yours wrote ſo much of the publyck view, of publiſhing the woundes of the Church, vndiſcreetly, before ſo many deadly enemyes of God and the Church: of not offending any one of Chriſts diſciples of not provoking Churches: of every one abounding in their owne ſence, &c. It is marvell if your tranſlatour turne not your owne wordes vpon your ſelf and tell you / that a Chriſtian an humble and godly mind ought to be otherwiſe affected, and ſetting a ſide the reſpect of their owne pryvate regard. &c. But this the more vnjuſtly if he made your letters publyck without your knowledg. Which we indeed at firſt did ſuſpect: tyll we ſaw your ſecond Epiſtle come forth ſome while after the other. Neyther could we well thinke other wiſe of the matter / ſpecially ſeing you wrote vnto vs / that we might rent the letters, and that you alſo would conceale it. Knowe moreover / that in the edition of your letters / there be certeyne clauſes wherin the tranſlation is not anſwerable to yours in latine ſent vnto vs: which we by your originall amend in our edition nowe ready to be publiſhed.
            Theſe (and many other things which yet we conceale) ſeem vnto vs to be of ſome moment. But we are deceived perhaps in our owne cauſe: and therfore you and your Tranſlatour would / omytting all cōfutation / that others ſhould have the iudgment therof: you in delyvering / he in publyſhing your letters. But why then did you not douchſafe to give vs any knowledg therof? At leaſt / why did you not ſo provide as that letter of ours which was in your handes / ſhould alſo be tranſlated and publiſhed? Did you thinck that Pro. 18, 1

               he which is firſt in his owne cauſe is iuſt? Why then did you not alſo mynd / that his neighbour comyng after him will make inquiry of him, that ſo both partyes being heard / judgment may be gyven according to truth and equity? For which cauſe / though we have hytherto borne this / yet will we hereafter meet with ſuch dealing by the beſt and fytteſt meanes we can. Neither doubt we / but all theſe things (howſoever now they ſtand) will at length fall out for good both to vs and to all other / which love Chriſt with all his ordinances / and hate Antichriſt with all his abhominations. And having this hope / we will expect and endure whatſoever it ſhall pleaſe God / who is the Lord and faythfull maynteyner of his ſervants.
            Concerning the differences (wherof you write agayne in your letters) which are betwene vs and the dutch Church of this city / it needeth not that we wryte vnto non of the particulars otherwiſe then as before we have donne. If you do yet deſyre more we give you to vnderſtand that above a yeare ſynce we delyvered in wryting the true and particular narration of the whole matter / to the miniſters and whole elderſhip of that Church: who (if yet they have not) ma

In the meane tyme / becauſe we are both pryvatly and publyckly ſo much vrged by you herevnto / we will briefely note the chief heades / wherin we differ from them / and where about we have had dealing with them / both before and ſynce you wrote vnto vs.

                  To his beloved brethren in Chriſt the Engliſh people at Amſterdam. Salutations in Chriſt.
            
            AN huge bundell of letters, beloved brethren, I received from you yeſterday in the evening. I gave you counſell to reſt from queſtiōs: you commaund me to enter into queſtions. I continew ſtill in my purpoſe: for I eſteem more of peace in the Church then of the ſeeds of ſtrife: they that are fedde with theſe ſeeds, ſhall reap the fruit. Where you conclude and pronounce that I do therefore aſſent vnto you, it is a falſe concluſion: As towching the matter I have enjoyned my ſelf ſilence: and although I be an hundred tymes called vpon by letters, I will continew ſtill in the argument of counſell till I ſee another courſe taken. If it like you not, let it alone: neyther do I like the handling of queſtions in this tyme. It is more according to God that I be ſilent from queſtions in this eſtate of things, then that I powre forth my ſelf and you together into them. You move many things in your letters, I wil reſt frō thoſe things, and will occupy my ſelf religiouſly in the work of the Lord. Chriſtian wiſdome will never ſuffer me to ſpeak of queſtiōs controverted, the one party being vnheard.
            That my letters vnto you, were tranſlated into Engliſh, I have now firſt knowen it by you: I knew not that it was done. You object that my letters were not ſhewed by you. I beleev it: for both by letters and reports of many I have ben certifyed that they were not ſhewed. If it pleaſe you, ſhew them, for me you may. All ſhall ſee, how falſe reports have ben given forth concerning thē. I neyther am aſhamed of them, neyther ever will be. But I pitty you (I ſpeak it vnfeynedly) who for my letters give forth in publick your concluſions. With good men good dealing ſhould be uſed. That the copyes of my letters were carryed into England, your ſelves may eaſily cōjecture, by what meanes it came to paſſe. About tē moneths ſynce, the Soveraign Quenes Ambaſſadour was there and two of your company dined with him. What hapned at that dinner you can remember. He came hither vnto me: he marveled at the fact of your departure: I told him that I had writtē vnto you, he deſired a copy. To you I gave counſell: whoſoever gave it forth in publick, hath done it without my knouwledg: I will not anſwer for an others doing, but for

myne owne. In the meane while I will pray God that he frame your mynds vnto the truth, wiſdome, love, and peace, and all our mynds vnto his glory. Farewell in the Lord. From Leyden in Holland.

Yet for the matter it ſelf if ſo be that with the Papiſts Anabaptiſts or any the like we did erre frō the true faith▪ we doubt not but you would open your mouth to anſwer / to refute / to convince.

Thoſe many things which are conteyned in your letters and ours do now come forth in publick. Neyther doubt we but this is the work of the Lord. See therefore that you be occupied therein religiouſly. That any ſhould ſpeak of things controverted, we deſier not otherwiſe then the reformed Churches and thoſe godly mē and Martyrs of Ieſus who with like purpoſe have publiſhed their confeſſions of faith and cauſes of their troubles being ſo conſtreyned.
            That your letters were not ſhewed by vs, we wrote not but this that we gave not a copy of them to any: for what cauſe / we wrote in our former. Shewed they were and read in the publick meeting of our Church If your mynd were to have them ſhewed to others that knew we not. But now that you write this is your mynd / we ſhall ſhew them together with ours publickly vnto all And if any have givē forth any falſe reports con
                     •
                  erning them, let thē now be aſhamed. In the meane time your ſelf provided by ſending yours at firſt vnſealed / that they ſhould be ſhewed to others and be read alſo of others before vs. Neyther doth it excuſe the matter / which you wrote in your ſecond, that

                  ōer whither

you ſhould have written, and that therefore you ſought and wayted an whole moneth, being vncertayne thereof. For we did ſignify both theſe expreſſely / in the Epiſtle dedicatory prefixed before that book which by the meſſenger was delivered vnto you. Els how knew you at the moneths end more thē before whither and to whō to ſend? Or when you knew / why did you not ſeale your letters? Was it becauſe you would have the ſhewed? We beleev it: as alſo that for the ſame cauſe / the copyes of thē were caryed into England. And this too we knew / before they were tranſlated in Engliſh: but we held our peace / wayting to ſee what would follow therevpon. Now your ſelf ſee they are tranſlated and given forth in publick. For them therefore and with them / we trāſlate and publiſh ours: by which will appeare that we have dealt well with good men. You may call them as you pleaſe: it ſkilleth vs litle: this is the very thing we deſier and endevour / that the ſimplicity of the Goſpell of Chriſt / the iniquity of the defectiō of Antichriſt / may more and more be made knowen vnto all. If for this thing you pity vs, we will beare it: praying that God in Chriſt would pitty you. Where you write / that two of our company dined with that honorable Ambaſſadour / it is not true / that we know of. Neyther can we cell / what hapned at that dinner. He ſent not for vs to come vnto him / neyther did we like to intrude our ſelves. If by vs he would have ben certifyed of our cauſe / we would have done it willingly and ſyncerely. And you alſo / when he demaunded of you / might have ſhewed our letters with your owne / and the cōfeſſion of our faith / and given alſo copyes of both the letters. So might the Tranſlatour have given forth both in publick. So had you provided / that ſentence ſhould not be given / the one party being vnheard. Which thing Chriſtian wiſdome, your ſelf ſay, ſuffreth not

In this behalf therfore you have erred / and this by you is to be anſwered: notwithſtāding that for his doing / himſelf is to anſwer / that tranſlated and publiſhed yours without your knowledg.
