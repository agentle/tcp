Which thing was doone the laſt yeere about the Moneth of Auguſt.
               Now that they could conclude no peace, they returned to their Armour, and prepared themſelues to warre, The Perſians euery where ſpoyled the Countrey, and layd the

               The Turkes were ſo plagued with hunger and peſtilence, and ſpecially by the plague, that they were compelled to leaue of their procéedinges, and deuide theyr Armie. At this preſent Sinan Baſſa, gathereth his Armie againe, and is before this Cittie, which is called Ezerū: 
                  Ezerum This Cittie ſtandeth vpon Euphrates. Heere he receiued ayde about the beginning of April. At the ſame ſeaſon, Armour, Artillery, and money, were brought by Pontus Euoxinus, to the Citty Trapezum, that they might be Trapezus. It deuideth Europe frō Aſia. ſent vnto the Armie.

It is reported that the Perſians, would gladly haue peace: for hether to the ſpoyle hath béene in their prouinces or Countries, for they in eſpeciall laid waſte theyr owne Countrey and Territories: that thereby they might repell their enemies. It appeareth alſo, that it repented the Turks of the beginning of that war.
               To omitte other thinges Beglerbegus came at that time from the Cittie Ezerū
                   where hee was Liuetenant, Beglerbeg and had loſt his head, becauſe he was prouoker and promouter, of that infortunate warre, vnleſſe that he had giuen to the wife and mother of the Emperour, two thouſand Duckets to ſpeak for him: whoſe pardon they obteyned of this condition that he ſhoulde bring into the Emperours Treaſury euery yéere 2000.

The Turks accuſe the Perſians, that they haue neglected to ſend Ambaſſadors and rewardes to Amuratha, the lawfull ſucceſſor of Soliman nus and Selimus: according to that couenaunt and compoſition which was made before time, betwéene Soliman nus the Emperour of the Turkes, and Thamus the king of the Perſians. Amurathes interpreted, that intermiſſion of ſending rewards and Ambaſſadors, as a contremp tious ſigne of enmity, when it was neuer neglected in the time of Thamus: and for this cauſe hee

Hee ouercame in Battail Baiazetes, the ſonne of Solymannus, who though his Father was liuing, made an inſurrection againſt his Brother Selymus, and thus he perſecuted him, by the commaundement of the Emperour, on ſuch ſort, that the wretched caytife, loſt bothe his life and the kingdome. And thus much we haue heard of Muſtapha. Now I will declare bréefely what I haue hearde of other matters woorthy of remembrance.

of ſo much miſery: whiles ſome of them be in ſuch ſeenritie, and ſo careleſſe, that they lye as it were buryed in pleaſures and idlenes: otherſome are occupyed in Ciuill wars, vnto their vtter deſtruction and confuſion, neither doo they conſider what the common enemie is aboute, or what ſhould be doone or prepared againſt him.
            
            
               Of the peace concluded betweene King Phillip and the Turke.
               
               
                  
                     ABout the Callends of May Iohn Marilian of Mellan, after Truce betweene the Spanyardes and the Turkes. he had obtayned héere of the Emperour, truce for three yeeres, departed hence to Venis, and from thence to goe into Spayne. He was héere three yéeres intreating for peace, and nowe at the length obtayned it, but on ſuch ſorte, that neither Chriſtian nor Turke, thinketh it to continue: for both of them applyed themſelues to the time, rather then that eyther of them deſired any freendſhippe of the other. For the Turkes are occupyed in the warres againſt the Perſians: and the Spanyardes in Ciuill warres.
               Moreouer, the conditions of the truce are ſuch, that whetherſoeuer of them liketh, may breake of without impeachment.
               It is to be lamented, that this moſt mighty king, is King Phillip of force to reſiſt the violence of the Turke, and will not

which thing he will not doo, becauſe he may more ſafely inuade his owne people: and ſo ſuffer the great Turke to rage at his pleaſure, and notwithſtanding, intreated for peace, and obteyned an vncertaine truce, doubtfull and not to be truſted.
               Bothe the publike and priuate ſtate of Chriſtians, beginneth ſo to fainte, and to decline, and as it were to were ſo ſore ſicke, that it is a manifeſt ſigne and argument, of ſome notable and ſuddaine mutation & chaunge.
               Many Chriſtians, euery day ſéeing the proſperous ſucceſſe of the Turkes, and hauing their felicity and proceeding in admiration: and contrariwyſe, perſeuing the miſeryes of the Chriſtians, beginne to reuolts: and receiue the irreligious impietie of Mahumet, denying Mahumet Chriſtes Religion.
               Among whom there were of late, three Italian Fryers or Munckes, of the which, two of them beeing apprehended, Chriſtians denying their faith by the fraude and malicious deuiſes of the Spanyardes, and Italians, dyed myſerably. The thyrd, for as much as he was an expert, famous, and eloquent Preacher, he gaue himſelfe ouer to the blaſphemies of Mahumet, and became a Turke. I omitte theſe thinges, becauſe I knowe that they are gréeuous vnto you, and lamentable, vnto whom I wiſh bothe eternall and temporall felicity. Let thys be in ſteade of a concluſion.
            
            
               
               Certaine other newes of the warres betweene the Turkes & the Perſians, dated the 9. of Iuly following, after the former Letters.
               
                  
                     SInan Baſſe, (of whome wee made mention before) returned Sinan Baſſe out of the Campe, which was againſt the perſians, to Conſtantinople, the 6. day of Auguſt, as he was returning, there mette him at Choalcedon 
                  A Cittie in Aſia againſt Conſtantinople. foure Gallies, with principall Captaines, called Baſlaes.
               The next day after his returne, he declared the concluſion of peace, betwéene the Turkes and the Perſians, and truce for one yéere, with the ſinguler contentment of the Emperour. The ſame Sinan Baſſe, brought with him to Constantinople, tenne of the chéefe of the Georgians, as pledges, leaſt that they ſhould inline at any time to the Perſians, and alwaies heereafter be ſubiectes to ye 
                  Turks. The Ambaſſadour of the former king of Fees, was ready euerie day to depart, and very well content, that the Turke was about to call home againe Ochialus, who was ſent to ayde the newe king: after that he vnderſtood the newe King of Fees, to haue yéelded vp to the King of Spaine, the Hauen called Larcaca, ouer againſt the Cittie Arzilla, the which Hauen is now kept, and defended with a garriſon of 600. Souldiers.
               There were Letters ſent to Venis from Constantinople, the 19. of Auguſt, and deliuered the 15 of September, that there was truce taken betweene the Perſians and the Turkes.
               
               There were Letters written from Conſtantinople, the

13. of Nouember, that there was a moſt noble and notable Ambaſſage of the king of Perſia, in the way to Conſtantinople, and almoſte there: which ſignifieth vnto the Turke, that if he would reſtore the Cittie Zerua, and all Media, according to the compoſition made with Sinan Baſſa, that then they woulde returne, otherwiſe they woulde proceede.
               They looked daily for the returne of Ochialus from Fees
               
               The 9. day of Marche is appointed for the circumciſion of the Turkes ſonne.
               It is concluded at Constantinople, with the Ambaſſadours of the king of Tranſyluania, that he ſhould adde to the olde tribute or penſion, foure thouſande Ducketes more.

Notwithſtanding in the former tyrannie, the Ruſsians, with the Tarters, were rooted vppe, in ſo much, that in 50. or 60. Myles, there are neither men, nor any buildings or houſes.
               Beyond Caſan, which ſtandeth on the otherſide of Vnolgot, about 500. Myles from Moſcha dwell the Tarters, called Nagii, of whom Tamerlen had his beginning as the Turkes reporte.
               
                  Tamerlen a Scythian, inuaded Aſia, and killed 200000 Turkes, in the yéere of Chriſt 1345.
               Theſe were once moſt mighty, but were deſtroyed with the like tyranny that the Ruſcians were.
               The cauſe of theyr vtter deſtructiō, roſe with this occaſion. For as much as they had no certaine Rulers: whom they ought to haue obeyed, they haue no ſtanding manſions or houſes, neither any vſe of mony, of Corne, or Salt.
               They haue Sheepe and Heards, Camells and Horſſes. The Nobilitie and Gentlemen of that Country, vſe theyr Mothers naturall tongue, they are called in Ruſſia Boyaren, with vs Noblemen.
               They wauer abroade hether & thether, with their Cattel,

without any certaine manſiō places, neither can they remaine aboue thrée dayes in a place, for lacke of paſture.
               Theyr habitation and magnificencie, conſiſteth in their Chariots, which haue dyuers Celles, or diuers places or Chambers: one for theyr Wiues, another for theyr Huſbandes, and the third for theyr houſhold ſtuffe, and to certaine lowſie ſkinnes or ragges.
               In the arſe of they Cartes, hang two great Lether Bottels, wherein they put Camels milke, Mares milke Cowes Milke, and Ewes Mylk, hand-ouer-head altogether, this they ſwallow vp greedily vntil they be drunk.
               They kil very ſeldome any Camells, Horſſes, Oren or Sheepe, vnleſſe that they bee diſeaſed, they boyle and ſeeithe the fleſhe of ſuch Cattell, as be ſicke, or as dye without kylling: and they deuoure it without eyther Breade or ſalte.
               The Nobeleſt men of them, eate vppe the pottage: as for their Seruaunts, they gather the Vrine of Camelles and Horſſes, and of other Cattell, which they account as very daintie. If they lacke this, they muſt be contented with Fenniſh and Mooriſh water. Whoſoeuer is the Murſi. ſtrongeſt and mightieſt among ye 
                  Murſians, hée killeth the weaker ſcotfrée without any puniſhment, & taketh away al that he hath, and for this acte he is highly commended.
               They haue neither maieſtrates, lawes nor iudgments. In the yéere of Chriſt 1563. ther was a Murſian, with one eye, whoſe name was Iſmaell, a notable Nigromancer.
               They are meruailouſly delighted with that arte, the cunninger that a man is in that Arte, the more is his eſtimation. The ſayd Murſa brought to paſſe with inchauntments, that he killed all the reſte of the Murſians, with tempeſtes and Thunderboltes, whom he could not otherwiſe ouercome.
               When he had killed certaine thouſands by this meanes, he ſuppoſed, that the reſt which was left aliue, durſt not

rebell: which thing befell to him proſperouſly. Neuertheleſſe, after his death, by the ſame meanes that he entreated others, by the ſelfe ſame his children were deſtroyed.

               Notwithſtanding, they béeing offended with the Emperour of Moſcho, haue coupled themſelues with the Creames, called alſo Tarters, who in the expedition or The Cittie Moſcho burnt 1571 ſetting foorth, and voyage of the Tarters, in the yéere of our Lorde 1571. ayded the Creames: at what time, the Cittie of Moſcho was ſet on fire and burnt.
            
            
               
               ¶ The true diſcription of the magnificall Tryumphes and Paſtimes, repreſented at Constantinople, at the ſolemnizing of the Circumciſion of the Soldan Mauhmet, the ſonne of Amurath, the thyrd of that name, in the yeere of our Lorde God 1582. in the Monethes of of Maie and Iune. T. H.
               
                  
                     IN the yeere of our Lord and Sauiour. 1582. the Soldan Amurathe, Emperor of Turkie, ſéeing his affayres to be in euyll order, perceyuing alſo the contrarietie of affections in his Subiectes, dyd now determine with himſelfe to winne the good will, and to be better beloued, and more eſtéemed of his then before, and alſo to be more redoubted, and had in greater eſtimation amongſt Straungers, and foreine Nations and Countries then euer, thought it neceſſarie and very requiſite, to make a great ſolemnitie in the Circumciſing of Soldan Mahumet his Sonne: and for the better performing of his purpoſed determination, dyd ſummon together the greateſt part of all Chriſtian Princes, to the ende that this Feaſt might be ſolemnized, as it were before the eyes of the whole world: And in déede, the Ambaſſadours of many Chriſtian Princes, and Mahumets, were ſent vnto Conſtantinople, that is to ſaye, the Ambaſſadour

of the Emperor of Fraunce, of Polognie, of Venice, of Perſia, of Fees, and of Tartaria, of Tranſiluania, and of Moldauia, with many other Princes. Now becauſe this pompeous Triumphe (the newes whereof hath runne through diuers places) ought to be ſolempnized, and ſhowne before ſo many people, of ſo many and ſundrie Nations, with what apparell, with what expences, and how magnifically doo you thinke was it begunne and ended.
               Now to declare vnto you, the place wherein ſundrie ſortes of Playes and Paſtimes were ſhowne, it was meruailous great and large, wherein was erected great Theaters and Scaffolds of woodde, diſtinguiſhed and ſeperated into diuers parts, as if they were Chambers appointed for euerie Ambaſſador, places as well to banquet in, as alſo for euerie Ambaſſador, places as well to banquet in, as alſo for to beholde the Plaies and Paſtimes. Amurathe, was in the moſt fayre and ritcheſt place of all the reſt, from whence he might through lattiſſes, or grates, ſée euerie one, without being ſéene of any one. Behinde him was his Mother, his Wife, and his Siſter: and on the one ſide of him was Sinan Baſſa, his Lieuetenant generall, then the reſt of his Earles and noble men, on the other ſide was the Ambaſſadors of the aforeſayde Kings and Princes. In the middeſt of all theſe Theaters there was a fayre Tyltyard, all open and diſcouerd, eightéene hundred paces long, and twelue hundred paces broade, verie finelie paued: and in the ſame there was two moſt excellent and auncient Pyramideſſes, the one of marble fowre ſquare, verie cunninglie made, and the foote of it to vpholde this Pyramides, there was fowre great and mighty Pillers, fowre ſquare, and round at the toppe, the inſcription whereof dooth ſhewe, that the Emperor Theodoſia, dyd cauſe the ſame to be erected in that place: the other was of ſtone cunningly erected, without any kinde of ſimonde or morter, and this was made

by the Emperor Conſtantine, and néere vnto theſe Pyramides, there were certaine péeces of woodde, ſet vp verie high, ſo that they did appeare much more higher then the Pyramides, theſe péeces of wood had betwixt them, reaching from the one to the other, engines made of cor
                     •
                  e, compoſed in manner of a Tabernacle, to the which was tyed an infinite number of Lampes, verie ſplendiſaunt, moſte dexteriouſlie handled, which caſt a great lyght throughout all the place. There was alſo a wheele, much lyke vnto Myll whéele, the which turned continuallie of it ſelfe. There were alſo fiue Images, in fourme and faſhion lyke vnto great pyllers, verie high made, all of waxe, and paynted with diuers collours, verie ſplendiſaunt, and ſhyning brightlie, becauſe of the golde wherewithall they were garniſhed: to be ſhort, all thinges were verie methodically and ſumptuouſly ſet foorth.
               Nowe the daye of Circumcizion approching, which was the eightéene of Maie, in the yéere aforeſayde, Amurathe and his Sonne, accompanied with Dukes and Earles, and many other Officers, together with many thouſands of people martched foorth, with great tryumph out of his Caſtle, dyrectlie vnto the place appointed, for theſe Playes and paſtimes: and as they diſcended from horſeback, there was ſhowne vnto them in the baſe Court of the Caſtle, thrée hundred ſtraunge Beaſtes, made all of Sugar, verie diuerſelie diſpoſed and ingeniouſly inuented. That doone, the Sonne of Amurathe followed with great and more brauer troope of men then before, went towardes his Mother: for it is the cuſtome of the Turkes, in the Cyrcumcizing of the Sonne of theyr Soldan or Seigniour, that this Sonne before his Cyrcumcizion, muſt goe and giue the Dirnear adieu, and laſt farewell vnto his Mother, whome he ſéeth no more: after that, he being now arriued at his Mothers Pallace,

leauing all his trayne apart, he went vnto her reuerently dooing his duetie, remayned with her alone the ſpace of two howres: after long conference, he humbly tooke his leaue and departed from her, dyrectly vnto the place of paſtimes, the manner whereof, I wyll declare vnto you, as héereafter followeth.
               THe cheefeſt place of the baſe Court of Amurathe, was finely paued, and garniſhed round about with Tapiſt
                     •
                  ie, and Tyſſue, and ſparckled with Golde and Syluer: In the middle thereof, went the fiue Pillers and Images aboue mentioned, layde, and loaden within the Chariots. Now as Amurathe paſſed round about this baſe Court, with an Army of men, beholde the Chariottes, began of themſelues to runne round about, both backeward and foreward, in ſuch ſort, that for the tyme, of the great crie, and ſhoote of all the people with ioye, of clapping of handes, with leaping, dauncing, and with Tabours, and Trumpettes ſounding, it rayſed ſuch a number, that all the whole Cittie dyd ſounde thereof: euerie man now might well knowe, what heapes, and companies of all ſortes of Nations, there were then in Conſtantinople: but amongſt ſo great a multytude, there were found fiftéene Turkiſhe ſouldiors, whereof ſome of them bare Speares & Iauelins, other ſome Kniues, which they had made faſt vnder their ſides, and in their hands: otherſome had Helmets or Headpéeces, ſo harde ſet vpon theyr heades, that the blood ranne downe vpon theyr foreheads, and they all bléeding, with ſuch ſores, woundes, and hurtes, to ſhew that they were ready preſt, to ſpend, and ſhedde theyr blood, euen to the laſt droppe, for the maintenaunce of theyr Princes life.
               His Sonne being now ſo recomforted (as it were) in his heart, with the great reioyſing and loyaltie ſhewed him of all the people, he cauſed to be caſt out, whole great handfulles of money, and he himſelfe caſt it out, in great

aboundaunce: and afterward, with all haſte and ſpéede, he came to finde out his Father: but as for his Mother, ſhe cauſed the verie ſame day a Feaſt to be made ready, at the commaundement of her Huſband, vnto the which there were bydden all the women, and the daughters of the Lordes, Seigniors, and Gentlemen of the Court: it were, and would be too tedious to ſet downe, and deſcribe the preparation, and great royaltie which was priuilie made at that Feaſt, where there was not one man among them all: yea, and one may preſume, that it was verie ſumptuous and coſtlie, when daye by daye they carried a thouſand diſhes of daintie meates, and as many fine ſugred Marchpanes into the Hal, where all theſe women were. Furthermore, Amurathe himſelfe, ſent them a gyfte, and preſent of fiue hundred Pillors of Sugar, verie artificially wrought: and this ſolemne banquet laſted, and continued ſeuen whole dayes together: and at the ende thereof, the Mother, the Wife, and the Syſter of Amurathe, together with all the women of theyr company, went to ſée the ſportes and playes.
               I wyll now in order ſhew you the Feaſt of Amurathe, the place, the gueſts, and the time, how long it laſted: but you muſt vnderſtand, this was not made in one onely place, nor that the gueſts dyd banquet together in company one with another, as Chriſtian people vſe, & accuſteme to doo: for, as for Amurathe himſelfe, he dined alone in his braue banquetting houſe, as in a Cage, accompanied onely with his Eunuches, and ſuch as were inſtruments, and miniſters to his ordinary pleaſures: the company of women had theyr banquet apart from him, as is aforeſayde: The Lordes and Seigniors of the Cittie, were ſeperated in theyr braue banquetting houſe, and the Kings, and Princes, Ambaſſadors in them. Moreouer, Amurathe mynding to blowe abroade his lyberalitie, did feaſt all theyr Officers within the Tentes, and Tabernacles

dreſſed, and made ready in the Iouſting parke, and after this manner he vſed, and entreated them. viz. The fyrſt day the chchéefe Gentlemen were inuited, and bidden: the next day following, were bidden theyr Officers: then after them the trauailers, or the aduenturers in the warre: and the Lords of the Court alwayes kept company with the Gentlemen: If you now aſke me, what, and how many ſortes of meates there were then ſerued at this Feaſt: there was no other thing at all, but Hennes, and Mutton, with ſome porredge, & boyled broath, and ſuch lyke things ſet vpon the table: but there you ſhould not ſée, Veniſon, Wildfowle, nor any kinde of Fiſhe, whatſoeuer, nor no dainty nor licquoriſhe meate, all ſimply, and homely dreſſed, if a man ſhould compare them with ours héere, and yet neuertheleſſe, all the gueſtes were well content with their fare, but they were euyl ſerued with their drinke, for they were ſerued with no other, but water & ſugar: They be ſuch people, as openly before any body, they abſtaine altogether from drinking of wine: but among themſelues priuily, all the wine in the world will not ſatiſfie, nor ſuffice them, ſuch gluttons, & licquoriſh people they are: and thus doo they feaſt themſelues twiſe euery day. And toward the euening, they bring foorth before the people (ſo deſyrous to ſée the Triumphes, and magnificenſies, which paſſe day by day, to behold) into the ſame Park aforeſayd, & being ſet downe together there vpon ruſhes, they bring foorth (I ſay) gréene chéeſe, bread, broath, and mutton, in a thouſand platters, and diſhes euery day: and as ſoone as the meate is brought, the Tabers, & Trumpets ſound out, at the firſt ſound wherof, the people comes rūning to this kytchin, fighting and ſcambling for theyr ſupper, and for theyr meate, as earneſtly as if it were to run to make an aſſault: ſo that one ſnatcheth on one ſide, and another on the other ſide, and that as one hath caught & gotten, another is ready to plucke and teare againe from him: and to

be ſhort, you ſhould ſée them run ſo on heapes after 
                     〈◊〉
                   victuals, as if they were dogs halfe ſtarued to death: yea, and a man might well call this a feaſt for dogs, for there was nothing at all brought them to drinke. The meates being taken away, Amurathe caſt downe from his Scaffolds, of golde & ſyluer by handfuls, with Goblets of gold and ſiluer, very cunningly wrought and made with péeces of golde, and diuers ſorts of money: behold now what a ſolemne feaſt this was.
               Now followeth it, to ſpeake of the playes, ſports, and paſtimes, the which I wil declare vnto you in thrée articles, how they were repreſented, & ſhewed at thrée ſūdry times. The one ſort thereof were called forenoone ſports: another were called afternoone ſports: and then the laſt of all midnight ſportes. The inhabitants, and Artificers of Conſtantinople, thoſe forenoone ſportes with all theyr royall and braue attyre. The ſouldiors and men of warre, the labourers, the minſtrels, the leapers, and dauncers, the inglers, and ſuch lyke, did employ, and buſie themſelues about the afternoone ſports. The midnight ſports were paſſed away with burning of Fortreſſes, Holdes, Horſſes, Elephantes, and other creatures made by arte. But let vs now conſider the forenoone ſportes, the beginning whereof, were meruailous and pleaſaunt: for preſently after the dinner which they had giuen to Amurathe, and to all his gueſts, ſoone after the Sun was vp, behold a great troupe & company, of more then a thouſand of the chéefe and principall Merchants of Conſtantinople, walking in braue apparell, with Enſignes & Tabors: the Turks martched firſt along, & then the Chriſtians: the Iewes were more ſumptuouſly apparelled then all the reſt, made theyr back warde: And before all this goodly company, went all the honourable, graue Syres, cloathed according to the dignity, and woorthineſſe of theyr ages, bearing with them, ritch preſentes, and gyftes of golde, and ſyluer: then followed

them, men of luſtie age, carrying alſo in theyr handes, other ſuch lyke preſents, and they marched on all armed. After them came all the young youthes decked, and trimmed vp in wenches apparell, with gownes, iewelles, and bracelets, and all other precious ornaments, and tyrings, the quiuer vpon theyr ſhoulder, the bowe in the left hand, and a crooked Foarde in the right: Theſe were followed of a company of pretie fayre lyttle chyldren, bearing of ſmall réedes, or Canes lyke vnto Dartes, and braunches of Palme trées, of Noſegayes, or Pōmanders, of Saffron in golden cloaues, all in high Hattes of the Turkes faſhion, cloathed in cloath of golde, with garmentes of embroderie: and long large gownes, as ritch, and fayre as poſſible might be. After all thoſe, there came thyrtie men, drawing vpon a Chariot of eight whéeles, a ſhop of eight cubites long, and ſix broade, beſet all within, with ſtarres of golde full of Tapiſtry, and precious coſtly cloathes: all this company hauing made thrée towres by the afore ſayd Parke, at the length areſted, and ſtayd in good order, euen in the middeſt thereof, ouer againſt Amurathe: and then you would haue ſayd, that the ritches, not only of Conſtantinople, but alſo of all the whole world, had béene brought into that Parke, for there ſhould you haue ſéene ſuch precious ſtones, ſuch pearle, ſuch golde, ſuch purple, and ſuch thinges of value, that one would pryſe, and prayſe them farre aboue both gold and pearle.
               Now as all this great company of Merchauntes were there reſting themſelues: one old man began, & ſo all the reſt folowed with one cōmon voice, to crie as loud as they could: God graunt the Emperor lyfe, with all proſperitie & felicitie. And after this ſalutation, ſome of the old aged ſort, dyd guide and conduct the Chariot, wherein the ſhop was, and brought theyr gifts and preſents, vnto the houſe of Amurathe, which on his owne behalfe, had alſo beſtowed giftes, & preſents vpon them: but becauſe I ſaw but

a lyttle, it maye be thought that the one gaue not againe, ſo much vnto a great many, as the great many dyd: and now it is come into my remembraunce, what the Poet ſayth: That ſuch is the myſerie of this life, that thoſe as haue but little, muſt yet beare and carie that themſelues, vnto the huge high heape of ritches. Euen ſo, Amurathe making a ſhewe to be lyberall towards the people, payed with a fewe ſmall trifling gyftes, the great ritches, which were offered him at this ſolemne Feaſt: Marke nowe I pray you, how one thing followes after another: for he then hauing both taken and giuen, the Merchaunts returned with them, as if they had béene parted, and gone away quite.
               The next daye after, Sinan Baſſa gaue the paſtime of two blockhouſes, in the one wherof was a bande of Chriſtians, and in the other a bande of Turkes: theſe Caſtles or blockhouſes, were couered all ouer with thicke paper, and ſtrengthened about with towers: he tooke with him thrée ſcore horſemen, which put themſelues in two bands, and fought for thoſe Caſtles, but the victorie ſtyll went on the Turkes ſide: It was a leane, and childiſhe 
                     •
                  aſtime, in the preſence of ſo notable a Seignior, to ſée thée Lieuetenaunt generall of all Turkie, make ſportes and paſtimes of chyldren, with his principall and chéefe Captaines: all the beholders thereof ſtoode a watching, to ſée ſome great royaltie come from that Baſſa, but they were deceyued of theyr expectation héerein. Well, let vs leaue off, and pretermitte this a thing ſo much to be laughed at, and let vs conſider of other thinges and ſightes, then, and there ſéene: and firſt of thoſe of the Admirall, who brought into the Parke, or Tiltyarde, a Fortreſſe made of boordes, and planted within an Iland of paper, encompaſſed with ſixe Galleies and Foyſtes, the which was called Cypreſſe. He beginneth ſtraight waye to beate downe this Fortreſſe with the Cannon ſhotte, which were within the

Galleies: then he cauſed to giue it an aſſault, and ſo carried it away: this loe, was the true ſhowe and repreſentation of the taking of Cypres: and in this aſſault you ſhould haue heard the Turkes bellowe and crie, ſo highe, and hideouſlie, that euerie one was aſtonied, and at his wittes ende.
               Then after that, all the handy craftes men, and Artificers of Conſtantinople, being prepared for the nance, and ſtryuing who among them all ſhould offer and giue vnto the Turke, the beſt and ritcheſt preſent and gifte, came to make a ſhowe in the Parke, without kéeping any order at all, but all in one daye, and as it beſt lyked euerie one of them.
               The fyrſt bande and company, was the Mahumemeticall Prieſtes, bearing Bookes in theyr handes, but chéefelie and aboue all, the Lawe of Mahomette, written in fayre great Letters: theyr Muſti, (which is in Turkie, as the Pope is in all Europe,) was ſet in a high Chayre, and carried vppon a Camell: at euerie ſteppe, he turned, and looked ouer the leaues of his Booke, fayning as though he had ſearched, and ſought for ſome great ſecrete matter: then hauing giuen his bleſſing vnto Amurathe, he was ledde into the Princelie houſe, to offer vppe his preſentes? which doone, he returned againe with his Prieſtes and Preachers. You ſhould haue then ſéene (which I cannot tell you but with great gréefe, and wéeping eyes) that great Patriarch of Conſtantinople, followed of his Cleargie, hauing the Patriarchall Robe (which is in manner of a Ceape) trayning vppon the grounde, and all of blacke, the which hee offered vnto the enimie of the Chriſtians, with a great ſumme of Golde, within a veſſell of Syluer: and then of all his, and of his ſorte, he was ſaluted with a loude voice: To ſaye the trueth, it was a ſyght moſt lamentable, at the beholding whereof, a man might

well alledge the auncient crie, and complaine of Hellas, Alas: At the which extremitie, the diſcorde thereof, hath raunged ouer, and deſtroyed a number of meſte myſerable Cittizens: he which hytherto, and héeretofore hath looked to haue all at commaunde, and himſelfe to be ſubiect, nor vnderling vnto none, beholde, into what pouertie, beaſtlie thraldome, and myſerie he is now fallen and come.
               After him, dyd martche along the Patriarche of Armenia, dooing euen as the other dyd. Then came the Artificers, bringing theyr Shoppes vppon Chariottes, and working of theyr Occupations, euen in the preſence of Amurathe, the which he marked as dillygentlie, as if he meant to haue learned ſome thing of them.
               I doo héere ſet thée downe (gentle Reader) the particulers, although it hath béene a thing verie greeuous vnto mine eyes to beholde and ſée, and to my hande to write, being meruaylous wearie, with thoſe ſo long paſtimes: yet if thou haſt tyme and leyſure, to reade, and peruſe the ſame, they will be vnto thée, but as playes, ſportes, and recreations.
               Fyrſt of all, then came the Goldſmythes, carrying diuerſe peeces of workemanſhippe of Golde, and of Syluer gylded, verie ritchlie, and artificially wrought, as Cuppes, Goblettes, Platters, Kniues, Penkniues, and ſuch lyke other thing: they were in number about an hundreth, bothe olde, myddle age, young men, and chyldren, all moſt ſumptuouſlie apparrelled. After them was drawne vpon a Chariotte with ſixe whéeles, theyr ſhoppe, glyſtering, and ſhyning round about on all ſides, by reaſon of the veſſelles of Golde and Siluer that were therein.
               After them you ſhould haue ſéen a great number of Orapers,

Taylers, Smithes, Maſons, Carpenters, then of meat dreſſers, which dreſſed and made ready, diuers ſorts of meats, and gaue them away fréelie to all thè people, which accomponied them: the Butchers martched alſo in order with theyr ſhambles, and butcherie well furniſhed with fleſhe, and with trypes: then came the Cookes with their kitchen, and cookerie: and after them the Fiſhmongers, with diuers good made ready diſhes of fiſhe: then the Victuallers, bearing diuers kindes of meates, and of wines made of water, and of cherries in great veſſelles, whereof they gaue to as many as would drinke: after them came the Bakers, the Potters, and the Ioyners, which preſented and offered vnto Amurathe, a gylded table, and beſette with diuers ſortes of verie braue, and fine ſtones: then the Grocers, and Appoticaries, bearing with them ſaffron, incenſe, ſynomond, India ſpyces, and other ſuch like ſpyces: then the Glaſſemakers, which made theyr veſſelles of glaſſe, in the ſight, and preſence of all men: then the Embroyderers, going in gownes, and cloakes of cloath of golde: then Dyers of all ſortes of cloathes of all ſortes, and collours: the Veluet men, the Taffyta men, the Parchment lace makers, the Cutlers, the Kniuemakers, the Sadlers, the Spurriers, the Fullers, the Tanners, the Curriers, the Chaundlers, all theſe hauing theyr place according to theyr degrées, and euerie thing in perticular. Yet muſt I not héere forgette the nobleſt ſorte of all Artificers, which are the Labourers, who with the plough, and twelue great Dren, laboured the earth in that Parke, to the great benefite, and good of all thoſe, which were aſſyſtaunt, and by at this paſtime.
               Neither muſt I with ſilence pretermit, and paſſe ouer, the Fiſhermen with theyr nettes, and all otheyr fiſhing tooles and inſtrumentes, being in a lyttle ſmall Cockeboate, from which they fiſhed, the little ſmall fiſhes: After

all theſe came the Barbars, which dreſſed and cut off the beardes and heaires, one of another: the

                     〈…〉
                  , with all ſortes of fruites, flowers, and hearbes, carrying about them for a ſhowe, the Images of him, whome the olde auncient Paganes, called the God of the Gardens, decked, and trimmed vp with leaues, Noſegayes, & Garlandes of flowers: they had behinde them, the Sheepheardes, Oxe kéepers, Horſe kéepers, Mule kéepers, Carters, Whéelebarrowe men, and Carriers with theyr Horſſes, Mules, and Aſſes, which were decked vp to make a laughing ſport of to the world. And becauſe that they preſented, and brought nothing with them, but woodde, water, and ſtones, they were ſtraight wayes driuen out of the Parke, and ſo they went theyr way with ſhame, and reproch. By this tale, you ſhould haue marked the auarice, and couetouſneſſe of Amurathe, which commaunded that they ſhould very honourablie entertaine, and make much of them, as brought him any fayre and ritch gift: yet contrarily, he neyther would ſée nor heare: but he draue them farre from him, which brought him giftes according to theyr abillitie and power, and not to his lyking.
               I muſt now ſet downe for the afterward, and laſt company, the Singers, Players of Inſtruments, Schollers, Monkes, Iuglers, Tumblers, and Plaiers: people which among the Turkes, are as like them in faſhions of liuing, in apparell, & in ſtyring from place to place, as one drop of milke is like vnto another, neither better nor worſſer:

the heart of the ſingers & Muſicians, had great good agréement and concorde, with the armie of ſeditious ſouldiors: there you might haue ſéen Arabians, Mores, Perſians, Grecians, and Spaniardes, ſounding of theyr Cornets, Trumpets, Tabors, Cyterons, and other Inſtrumentes within the Parke, or Tiltyard, where they made ſuch a confuſed noyſe and ſound, without tune, change of note, or kéeping of tune and ſpace, that all the whole Toune ſounded and rong with the route of theyr voices, and ſoundes. Laſt of all, marched on the Scholers, which of a truth you would not haue iudged to haue béen ſuch: but rather you would haue taken them for, Pilgrimes, and begging Friers: for a man could not haue preſumed any otherwiſe of them, ſéeing them wrapped in ſuch couerings, with white hattes tyed about the myddle with ſtringes: bare footed, with fowle dyrtie handes, and a moſt filthy and yrkſome countenaunce to beholde: they preſented vnto Amurathe certaine bookes, and painted papers of theyr owne inuention. The Monkes followed after them, with a company of poore Pilgrimes, which goe in pilgrimage to Mecque, as they call it, which is the Sepulchre of Mahomet, they are counted verie holie men in Turkie: cloathed lyke Scholers, which doo nothing but labour and trotte vp and downe with theyr bodies, making themſelues leane, as in the ende, they looſe all theyr witte and vnderſtanding: and becauſe they reſted, nor ſtayed not in any one place, at any time, but alwayes were ſkipping, and dauncing about: a man might verie well compare them vnto Curetes, and Corybantes, the auncient Prieſts of Cybele, the graund mother of the two Paganes: vnto them it was among all other, that Amurathe cauſed many ſmall preſentes to be made. They were preſentlie followed of Players, more in number then flies, or gnattes, one ſort maſking wiſe, other ſome hauing Myters, lyke Popes, and crowned: balde, and halfe ſhauen, theyr viſages

of all moſt ſtraunge: with Goates beardes, theyr mouthes wide open, as if they would haue ſwallowed vp as many as looked vppon them: ſome of them hauing theyr garmentes all to broken, and as it were fleade ouer theyr eares: other ſome halfe naked, and halfe couered, and other ſome altogether naked, and ſhameleſſe without meaſure.
               Now theſe proper youthes, and naughtie packes, being once come into the Parke, they beganne to crie out, to ſnort, and to laye on loade vppon the pales, and vppon the kettelles, pottes, and pannes, platters, and baſons, ſtryking vppon lyttle belles, chyldrens rattles, and cymballes, with a moſte ſtraunge and confuſed noyſe, entermixte with daunces, and theyr moſt horrible and diſſolute behauiours, for they made mockes and mowes, and gyrned at as many as laughed at theyr follies, and they neuer ceaſed to turne and tumble vppon both hand and foote. There was amongſte them one Spaniarde, who being ſeperated a lyttle a ſunder from the reſt, beganne to leape and daunce, both his compaſſe and meaſure, with ſuch a ryght remoouing of his féete, and as orderlie wauing, and ſhaking of his handes, and with ſo braue a turning rounde of all his whole bodie, together, ſo fyne, and artificiallie, that hee dyd moſte properlie ſhowe, and ſet foorth in a manner, all the braue ieſtures, and moouinges of the body (preſcribed, and foretolde of by Plato:) bothe backewarde and forewardes, to the ryght hande, and to the lefte: high, lowe, and rounde: whereof; and whereby, all the beholders conceyued a woonderfull great delyght, and pleaſure.
               Moreouer, theſe aforenamed players had among themſelues, as it were a chéefe Captaine, which was an olde man, the moſt villaine, and arranteſt knaue of all the whole company: and he forſoothe was ſet vpon an Aſſe,

the which thrée young merchaunt men vppon croutches, and gyrded about with a lynnen cloath, and halfe naked, went before, holding him vp vppon ſtaues. This ſight aboue all the reſt, terrified me verie ſore, and then for the tyme, my ſpéeche was quite taken from me, and my tongue was, as if it had béene faſt tyed to the roofe of my mouth. Nowe ſome of that company made paſtime all daye long; with Apes, Catles, and Dogges, with young Goates, and lyttle Mules, with Hartes, and ſmall byrds: vppon which theyr ſportes and paſtimes, Amurathe him ſelfe, being giuen altogether to vanities, was more attentiue, then vnto any other, yea, then all the reſt: for there was nothing with them, but gamboldes, friſkes, and daunces, moriſques, ſinging, cryinges out, and ſuch lyke vaine exerciſes: ſome of them in this theyr ſporting and playing, were bytten of Serpents, and venemous beaſts, and preſentlie then againe they were healed, and made whole of the ſame byting: and then loe, they made many moſt ſhamefull countenaunces and faces, moſt vnwoorthy to be ſet downe in writing.
               Hytherto, I haue ſpoken altogether of the forenoone 
                     〈…〉
                  tes: let vs therefore now conſider of the afternoone, which were no leſſe ſauced, ſpiced, and peppered, with pompe and pride, then the other, although there was not in them in all pointes, ſo great ſtore of ritches, and magnificencie, as in the firſt. Was it thinke you a leane, or thinne ſport, to ſée ſo many Souldiors fighting, as in battayle raye: and ſo many Footemen aſſayling; and forbidding the Turke as it were from his Caſtles, and Holdes, with wraſtling men a number, and dauncers, martching altogether, and with a number of others, making proofe of all theyr proweſſe, and manhood? There was not one man to be founde, which tooke not great pleaſure and delyght, to ſhewe all his valiancie, as well for him ſelfe, as for all thoſe as behelde and looked on.
               
                  
But I will firſt beginne with the Combat of the wraſtlers, an exerciſe very much ſette by among the Auncients, and ſuch a one, as did verye much delight as many as behelde the ſame: For the Herauld had no ſooner ended his proclamation, and crye, but ſtraight wayes came foorth in to the ſame place, xv. couple of wraſtlers, all naked and oyled after the olde faſhion, to catch holde the one by the other, euery one by his companion: one amongſt the reſt, pricked and praunced on, and ſette out himſelfe in the middeſt of the place, ſhowing his broade ſhoulders, ſhaking his armes, and as Dares did, whereof Virgil maketh mention, challenge and prouoking the reſte to wraſtle: and ſuddainly a young man came in before him, which was to ſight, no leſſe ſtronge, nor ſtoute then the other, and he beganne luſte lie to caſt vppe his legges, and his fiſtes into the ayre, then hauing made a prayer with a lowde vayce, and marching a little vp and downe, to make himſelfe ſomewhat nimble and plyant, hee layes me faſt holde vpon him, as had ſo defyed him, by and by they came vnto handy gripes, and to graple themſelues together, laying eache other vpon the grounde, flatt vpon their noſes, then ryſing vppe againe, they fell to it luſtily, ſometime thruſting and puſhing, and ſometime clypping, and colling eache other very ſtraightlie: ſometime ſhifting of places, and lifting one another vp aloft into the ayre. The one of them went about to catch the other faſt by the legge, wherby he ſhould leeſe his offered blowes and breath and all together, but he there with vnfolded and vntwined his legges, and ſette vpon the other as earneſtlie, for to make him looſe all that laboure: nowe they hauing béene at their priſes for the ſpace of three 
                     〈…〉
                  es, they were bothe ſo weary, ſo ſoultry whot, and ſo out of breath, and yet ſo fleſhed one againſt an other, with choller, and ſhame to ſée all the whole Courte ſtanding, and watching all ye while vpon them, giuing iudgment on them, ſo that in the ende,

they were well faine to giue ouer and reſt themſelues, and then Amurath commaunded them to depart. Then came the other alſo in their order, but they wreſtled not ſo ſtoutly, nor yet ſo long as the firſt did. And this is al that the wraſtlers did.
               Behold now came a company of 50. men, all on Horſbacke, well armed, and furniſhed throughout, both for theyr handes, and for all the reſt of their bodies, for all ſortes of Combats, theyr crooked ſwordes by theyr ſides, their bucklers about their neckes, their howes in theyr left handes, and ſtaues in their right handes, like vnto the halfe Pikes of Arabia, for the paſtime and ſporte which they would make.
               But becauſe theſe bee extraordinarie ſights, I haue thought good to write and diſcribe them ſomewhat more at length. Firſt of all, there were layde in the aboue named Parke, eyght heapes of Grauell, of equall height, and diſtaunce, foure on the one ſide, and foure on the other. In the midſt was a narrowe ſtraight way, but well couered ouer with fine thinne ſandy Grauell, of purpoſe: that if any of them in running ſhoulde fall downe, their fal ſhould not hurt, nor endaunger them, by meanes of the ſoftnes of the Grauell: vpon theſe hylls of Grauell, were faſtened ſtaues and poſtes, hauing foure on the one ſide white, all round at the point, and the other foure alſo white, made cirkle wiſe and as a fireſhouell, all made of Leather and Paper very properly. They were the poynts, and endes, where hée might ſitte and ſée all the ſporte and play of the Horſmen which began to march on that way ſteppe by ſteppe: fyrſt by great, then in raigne, and as in battail raye: vpon that they put themſelues out of ranke altogether, and beganne theyr race with ſlacke brydle one after an other, and ſo neere, and iuſt vnto one another, that theyr horſſes were one at anothers heeles: and in running, they tooke theyr arrowes

out of theyr Duiuers, and couched them in ſuch good order that they touched the verie rundels, ſo ſwiftly and ſo quickly as the eye was able readily to ſée the marke at the ſeconde courſe, becauſe they had not drawen, nor ſhott before but onely at the rundels, they now ſetled themſelues againſt both the two, aſwell the rundels, as the others made cyrklewiſe (as I tolde you) and with ſo wonderfull a quicknes, and readineſſe therein, and helping themſelus ſometime with the left hand, and ſometime with the right without any turning or bowing of their bodies: and for the third charge, courſe or onſette in couching, they one while couered their right ſhoulder, and an otherwhile the left, with their bucklers, and that with quicknes incredible.
               Moreouer, in running at all the brydle, they drew out theyr ſwoordes, and cutte the rundels, percing quite through the other faſhioned cirkles, and all this was doone in one onely courſe or race: then turning the bridle all ſhort, they addreſſed themſelues againſt the endes and poyntes thereof, and with their drawen ſwordes, they abated and beat downe the ſame: and by that meanes they got againe their bowes, and made one ſhoote or draught vp into the ayre: Furthermore, they wrought and did great maruailes with theyr halfe Pikes, in diuers kindes of Combatts, and in the ende when with theyr ſwordes they had cutte in peeces, they plucked vppe the ſtaues and poaſtes which were made faſt within the Grauell hylles, and caſt them vppe into the ayre, and in running, they caught and helde them faſt in their hands, then lyfting them vppon their horſe ſaddles, they beganne to vſe and handle them as before they did theyr ſwordes, and long bowes.
               But before I leaue off and giue ouer theſe particulers, I will ſpeake of one thing, moſt worthy of all to be marked and
               
                  
ſuch a thing in déede, as a man may take it vnpoſſible, but I my ſelfe ſawe it.
               Out of theſe aforeſaid number of 50. went two younge men, verie faire and braue among all the reſt: the one of them ſtoode on his feete, in the ſaddle vpon the Horſback, and tooke his companion vppon his armes, ſtanding vpright vpon his feeſe, and béeing in this order, and manner, they put foorth the Horſe, (and gaue him the Carriere:) and they held them very faſt, and hee that was the vppermoſt of them, ſh
                     •
                  t out all his arrowes againſt a reſt, and proppe of woode, which he had in his right hand, that caried him. Moreouer theſe two young men hauing ranged vp and downe, and

There were others alſo among them, which hauing ſixe naked ſwordes, and the poyntes thereof faſt tyed vpward to theyr Horſe ſaddles, put theyr heades alſo vpon, and toward the ſaddels, and theyr feete vpwarde, and ſo made the Horſſes to runne a galloppe, as faſt as if a man ſhould ſay, thus and thus it ſhalbe. On the otherſide there were among them, which ſette them two at once in one ſaddle, and as the Horſe ranne with all his power and might, they ſkipped vppe and downe from the Horſe, and then to the Horſe againe, very nimbly and luſtlie, one after an other, and neuer made no ſtoppe nor ſtay at all: others there were, which turned themſelues bothe backwarde and forwarde in the ſaddell, the Horſe ſtill running, and courſing vp and downe verie roughlie, and

This béeing doone, they all ranne togeather on a heape, and béeing gotten vp againe on feete, vppon the Horſe ſaddels, they ſhot out theyr arrowes very ſtronglie and with great violence: and béeing in the ende diſperſed and ſet ſo a ſunder, they ranne one againſt an other, with their halfe Pykes and Iauelins, and did ſhow diuers ſuch notable feates, as the olde auncient ſpeare men were wont and accuſtomed to doo in courſes and feates of Cheualrie: furthermore, they taught very many fine feates and moſt notable, vnto theyr men of warre: as howe to prepare and make ready the battaill: to aſſaile: to preſſe: to encloſe the enemie, and hemme him in one euery ſide, to ſtrike him both on the right ſide and on the left, to deck and trimme vp their owne companies, and to giue the onſette: to take in and to rebate: to pricke on, holde faſt, and turne theyr horſes, to purſue and follow after, to leaue off againe as they luſt: to take: to ſpoyle: to breake in, and thruſt vpon the enemie ouercome: to encourage the hearts of the Souldiers when he hath the worſt, to gather all his companies together: finally he taught all the particular pointes of warre, wherofboth Souldiers and Captaines ought not be ignoraunt.

               WEll now that we haue ſpoken ſufficiently of y• ſight of the Horſmen, let vs alſo beginne to ſay ſomwhat of the Combattes, and ſkirmiſhes, and of the taking of the Fortreſſes, and Holdes by the foote men: where the Reader ſhall ſee howe the Turks tooke them by aſſayling and invading of them.
               There were two Fortreſſes made of Boardes, gylded and painted with djuers colours, well garniſhed with Walles, little Towres, Rampires, and Bulwarkes,

whereof the one was called the Turkes Fortreſſe, and the other the Almaignes, or Dutchmens, and there were 30. Souldiers clothed with the Armes and attire of the Almaignes in the one: and 30. of the Turkiſh ſide in the other, which was garniſhed and decked vppe with many Engines and fine deuiſes of warre. And for to beginne, the Almaignes which would firſt bee ſeene, and haue as it were the vpper hand of all: ſent two of theyr ſpyes vnto the Turkes Campe, wherevnto when they were approached and come, they behelde and ſaw, to theyr payne and gréefe, what they were minded and determined for to doo. For there was one of the two taken, and the other ſaued himſelfe by ſwiftnes of foote, and he tolde vnto the Almaignes howe all thinges had paſſed. Nowe when they vnderſtoode of the Turkes euill meaning towardes them, they went thence away, to conuay and hyde themſelues very vnorderly, about the Turkes holde, who beeing as it were amazed thereat, and troubled with theyr noiſe making, went all of them out thereof, giuing a charge, ſetting the Almaignes in a rowte or company, and leading them fighting, euen vnto theyr Trenches, crying out with a lowde voyce, ſaying, that this ſhamefull flight of the Almaignes, had brought vnto them a woorthy victorie: and as for the Almaignes, thys rowte and companye nowe ſwelling in ſtomacke againſt them, they began to conſult and determine of what was to be doone, iudging with themſelues, that it be

               The Almaignes caryed Pikes, Eucklers, and ſw
                     •
                  rds, but the Turkes couered themſelues all ouer with theyr Bucklers, marching all a greate, and fayning that they were afrayde, and that they would not fight at all,

which did ſo encourage the Almaignes, that they thought verily to weary and tyre the Turkes, who béeing nowe well awakened, and ſtirred vppe with this mockerye, gaue them a ſigne and token, laying handes vpon theyr weapons, and crying with a lowde voyce Alla, Alla, (which is as much to ſay, as God:) they made their péeces play: then they came vnto the battell, which was ſo ſharpe, that what of one ſide, and what of the other, theyr number was not much vnlike: then was there againe a newe Combat, and ſkirmiſh to recouer the bodyes, but that was ceaſed and ſtinted by and by: The Almaignes nowe retyred into theyr owne quarters, whether alſo the Turkes approched, ſo that the ſkirmiſh began afreſh whereas the one part ſought againſt the other verye ſharply, and a long time: in the ende, the Turkes conſtrained the Almaignes to ſaue themſelues within their Caſtels, whereas they did beſiege them, fighting moſte furiouſly, and laying on luſtie loade againſt the place, with all the power of theyr peeces. The Almaignes yet reſiſted them very brauely, and withſtoode a great many of theyr aſſaultes, but at the laſt they were ouercome by the Turkes, who beganne to beate downe theyr Gates, to ſpoyle, and to kill as many as they founde hidden in any place, to thruſt downe the other from the toppe of the Caſtel to the bottome, to areſt them that fledde, and to bring them Captyues, with theyr handes faſt bounde behinde at their backes: this doone, they ſe

And beſides all this as happened and chaunced at the Combattes, and in the taking

(as aforeſayde) three men which ſtoode and behelde this warre, were ſlaine and kylled with Cannon ſho

                  te: ſuch are the ſportes, and paſtimes of Tyrauntes, which neuer make an ende and giue ouer, without ſhedding of blood: Let vs now ſaye ſomewhat of the Speare men: I wyll tell you at one bare worde, that of fiftie couple of runners, there were not two found, which dyd meete, and encounter eche other tenne tymes: neyther yet any otherwiſe, but in fréendlie paſſing one by an other: by reaſon whereof, all the whole world cried out amaine vppon thoſe gentle Iouſters, which were conſtrayned to retyre: but the two laſt runners, being aſhamed thereof, at theyr laſt Courſe, dyd ſo boyſterouſlie, and ſo fiercelie encounter eche other, that theyr horſſes were both kylled with the brunt then giuen betwéene them, and the two runners them ſelues verie gréeuouſlie hurt therewith.
               Then came before them one of the Wraſtlers, a verie mightie, and a meruailous ſtrong man, woorthy to be compared vnto that Milon ſo much extolled, and celebrated at Crotone: for proofe of his proweſſe, he lyfted vp an high, a long péece of woodde, which twelue men could not ſtyre, nor remooue from the ground, but with great paine, and with much adoo: then he tooke the ſame vpon his ſhoulders, without holding the ſame with his hands: and afterward, being layde downe flat vpon the ground, and his ſhoulders, and thighes being faſt tyed and bound, he tooke vp and bare vppon his breaſt or ſtomacke, a great thicke ſtone, which tenne men had rowled awaye, and yet he made but a mocke and laughing ſtocke of that his loade. And yet beholde, a thing more meruailous then all theſe: fowre men dyd cleaue long péeces of wood vppon his bellie. Moreouer, with his téeth and his handes, he dyd bruſe, and breake in péeces, a horſenayle of yron, and with ſuch force, that the one halfe ſtucke faſt in his téeth, and of the reſt he made two péeces, in eche hand one:

and with thrée blowes with his fyſt, vpon the Coulter of a Plough, he brake it quite in ſunder: and with his bar

                   tongue he lycked the ſame Coulter put into the fyre all redde hotte: the ſame man alſo, with his téeth alone, dyd ſaddle, bridle, and harneſſe a horſe, and dyd diuerſe and many other moſt meruailous thinges: by reaſon whereof he gotte to himſelfe great gaines, and was very much praiſed, and cōmended of all men, becauſe of his ſtrength, and force altogether ſo extraordinarie and ſtraunge. But before I make an ende of the diſcourſe of the afternoone ſportes, I haue conſidered with my ſelfe, that it ſhall not be any thing at all hurtfull to the Reader, if I ſpeake a worde or two, of the dauncers ouer the lyne: many of them there, ſhewed foorth braue proofes of theyr ſkylles: but there was one among all the reſt, which gained and gotte the garland from them all: and I knowe no man that was not wholie rauiſhed, to ſée them runne ſo ſuddainlie, with ſo good a grace, without ſtinting, and with ſo valiaunt a boldneſſe.
               A certayne Poet reporteth in one of his Commedies and Stories, that the ſimple and common people were in a muſe, at the beholding of one named. Quidam, which walked vp and downe vppon a Corde or Lyne: But if ſo be that this Poet had ſéene that as I ſpeake off, he would without doubt, haue béene driuen out of countenaunce: for this fellowe went vp vpon the Lines, which were faſt tyed to the rafters, and beames of the houſe, as high as a man might well diſcerne, and with ſuch ſwiftneſſe and nimbleneſſe, that a man would haue ſayd, that they had béene Ladders or Stayres, and then he came downe againe verie boldlie, both backewardes, and arſewardes (as they ſaye) and alſo foreward, not hauing any other ſtaye, or proppe, but a lyttle ſmall ſtaffe, or ſticke, wherof he made him a counterpeiſe: one whyle he daunced vpon the Cordes with both fée

                   the verie bottome of all, and that as I eſteeme the cheefeſt, and principalleſt ſport and paſtime of all is: at night forſooth, he tyed faſt to eche of his féete, ſi

                  e naked drawne ſwords, and continued his ſport, with ſuch playing, and paſſing away of the tyme, and with ſuch clapping of handes on all partes, ſo that if by chaunce any one of the lookers on, ought him any mallice or grudge, or would haue wrought him any miſcheefe in his ſleepe, he himſelfe by his agillitie and nimbleneſſe, would preſently haue awaked out of his ſleepe: by meanes whereof, by the common voice and crie, of both great and ſmall, at that ſolemne aſſemblie, he was called and named, the cheefe and principall maiſter of that craft or occupation.
               You haue now already ſeene (good gentle Reader) the royalty and great woorthineſſe of the ſports and paſtimes, of both before and after dinner, verie groſely giuen & ſet downe before you: but in few wordes, & of a verie trueth.
               Let vs nowe then conclude, (if it pleaſe you) and let us deſcribe vnto you, the ſightes which they made, and were to be ſeene in the night: and although that they were not much vnlyke vnto the day ſportes, yet I will in bréefe declare them vnto you. Preſentlie and immediatlie after Sunne ſet, they lighted theyr Lampes, which were hanged vp in the Tabernacle, and in the wheele made of Cordes: (whereof I haue ſpoken heeretofore) the which Lampes, turned verie round by art & cunning, and burned verie cleare, and lyght all the whole night. Moreouer, there were euery night, lighted in the ſayd Parke, to

the number of thyrtie Lynks, or Torches, from the which, all the whole Theatre, receiued a moſt famous and cleare lyght, and brightneſſe. Now theſe thinges being in this order diſpoſed, they ſhotte off ſquibbes full of pouder, which made a meruailous noyſe and ſounde: and as they fell vpon the ground, they ſpette out ſix or ſeuen ſparkles, lyke vnto Starres, and verie pleaſaunt to beholde.
               Then after all this, they brought in euerie day, day by day into this Cloiſter▪ ſixe, eight, and at the moſt, ten Fortreſſes, Towers, or Shippes, made of boords, couered properlie with Paper, or with fine linnen cloath, gylded, and verie ritch, and ſumptuous made, with diuerſe paintings and collours, and then they gaue fyre vnto them: they were made ſtrong, both within and without, and of all ſides, with ſhort péeces, lyke vnto Mortiers, which are a kinde of Artillerie of yron, ſhort, and hauing many ringes or cyrcles, onely vſed in Shippes for nayle ſhotte, being well appointed, with ſquibbes, and with pouder for the Cannons, without any lacke or want therof. And as ſoone as they put too fyre, there preſentlie followes a noyſe lyke lyghtning and ſtraunge thunder. Theſe ſquibbes dyd flée about in the likeneſſe of Serpen

                  es, and were powred out round about the Theatre: and to make an ende of this brute or noyſe, they had in theyr company, the ſounds of Trumpettes and Tabors. Theſe ſo fearefull noyſes were nothing at all pleaſaunt, but rather ſhewed, and betokened the aſſault, and taking of Conſtantinople. Furthermore, you ſhould haue ſéene the ſhapes, and figures of men, cloathed after the Perſian, Italian, and Allemaigne faſhion: alſo the ſhapes and figures of Elephantes, Camelles, Dogges, Horſſes▪ Aſſes, Wildeſowle, and other lyke creatures, all full of Cannon ſho

                  te and powder, vnto the which they put fyre, and then they were all brought to nothing.

clocke, and ſometime (at the commaundement of Amurathe) vntyll thrée of the clocke after midnight.

                  eigned, that Iupiter knew well how to correct and chaſten, the intollerable pride of Salmone

               Moreouer, becauſe that the acte of Circumcizion was doone by night: beholde, and marke well wherefore I haue deferred vntyll now, to ſpeake of the Ceremonies, which then were obſerued, the which I wyll touch bréefelie and in fewe wordes: The ſeuenth day of Iune, Amurathe, cauſed Proclamation to be made, that they ſhould bring into the Parke aforeſayde, all thoſe as were to be Cyrcumcized: with promiſe by him made, to giue vnto euerie one, a gowne, a ſhyrt, and a hundred peeces of money, which were woorth about ten pence a peece: and at this crie or Proclamation, there was gathered together ſuch a multitude, of young chyldren, ſeruauntes, lacques, and ſlaues, which came moſt part, rather for the deſyre of gayning the giftes, then vppon any deuotion at all: ſo that they lacked and needed aboue thirtie Surgeons to dreſſe them, and yet they were occupied about them all that daye, and moſt parte of the night: And in the ſame night, after the ſportes and paſtimes were all ended, and about two of the clocke in the morning, Mahumet, the ſonne of Amurathe, the young Prince of ſixteene yeeres olde, was Circumcized, not openlie, but in

Firſt of all, were the weddings of the Daughter of Amurathe made, who was maried to the Admyrall of Turkie: theſe weddinges were royallie feaſted for the ſpars of fiue dayes. Then by chaunce it fell out ſo, that Sulthane, the wife of Amurathe dyd not goe her full tyme all out: and the tumult grewe betweene the Ianiſſaries, and the Archers of his Garde, the which dyd riſe in tumult, the one againſt the other, in his preſence, and within the Parke, with ſuch furie and

                  〈…〉
               inglie in himſelfe: and before that the world was builded by him, and by them he builded the world: and by them he gouerneth it. And theſe thrée properties, we call them thrée perſons: and becauſe theſe thrée properties, doo not deuide the onelie and moſt ſimple ſubſtaunce of God, therfore be is God, and with theſe properties he is one God, and there are not three Gods.
            We doo beléeue, that the worde and ſpirite, doo ſpring but of the nature of God, as from the fyre, lyght and heat: and as the fyre, although there be nothing, that can be lyghtned, and be made warme by it: notwithſtanding, the ſame fyre hath alwayes lyght and heate, and ſendeth out lyght, and heate. So, before the world was builded, the worde was, and ſo was the ſpirite, naturall powers of God, becauſe God is a minde, or ſubſtaunce, as it was ſayde before: and theſe thrée, the minde or ſubſtaunce, the worde and ſpirite, is one God, as the ſoule of man is the minde: and a worde intellectuall, and an intellectuall

will, and notwithſtanding theſe thrée in déede are one ſoule. Moreouer, wée call the worde, the wiſdome of God, and the power: and his Sonne, becauſe he is the ſonne of his naturall ſubſtaunce, and as we call the ſonne of the nature of man, the ſonne of man: and as the cogitation of this minde is: ſo is it in theſe diuine things. Furthermore, we name the will of God, the ſpyrite of God, and loue: Wée call the minde the Father, becauſe he is not begotten, and without a cauſe, the cauſe of the ſonne and of the ſpirite. Becauſe therefore God doth not vnder ſtand onely his creatures, but more he knoweth and vnderſtandeth himſelfe, and for this cauſe he hath the worde and wiſdome, by the which he vnderſtandeth himſelfe properlie. Likewiſe, neither he willeth and God loueth onlie his owne workes, but he willeth and loueth himſelfe much more: therefore the word and ſpirite goe foorth or proceede out of him euerlaſtinglie: and theſe twaine with God are one God.
            Wée beleeue that God hath builded the world by the word of his wiſedome, and of his power, and by the ſpirit of his good will, he foreſéeth and gouerneth, and mooueth euery nature to good, according to the order of euery nature: and for this cauſe we beléeue that when God will conuert men by his onely mercy, from the deceit of deuils and worſhipping of Idoles: becauſe in a little place of the Iewes, in the which he was worſhipped and beleeued to be one God according to the Lawe of Moſes, the reſt of the whole worlde worſhipped the creatures wickedly, and many Gods, becauſe that they are none, in the place of one and him true, and euery man liued according to their ſenſuall apitites, and not according to God: then God reſtored man by his worde, and by his holie ſpirite, and therfore the worde of God put vppon him the nature of man, that as man, he might be conuerſaunt with men, and as the word of God and wiſedome ſhould teache men to beléeue

in one true God, and to leade their life according to that Lawe, which he hath giuen, and againe, as a man, that he might giue a reaſon of his life, and example of his doctrine: Hee fyrſt kept the Lawe, which he gaue vnto men: as the word of God and power, he might reſtore, the moſte comelie goodnes which he woulde. For it coulde not bée, that by the power of one man, the whole worlde ſhould bee conuerted to God: and thus the omnipotent and inuiſible God, hath ſowen the trueth by hys worde in Ieruſalem: By his ſpirite hee illuminated and confirmed his Apoſtles, that they ſhould ſowe the trueth throughout the whole worlde, and that they ſhoulde contemne death through the loue of God, who had ſent them, and by the loue of the ſaluation of the world, according to the enſample of Ieſus, who dyed willingly, according to that which was of man, that the world might be ſaued.
            Thus we beleeue one God in Trinitie, the Father, ſonne, and holy ſpirite, as our Lord Ieſus hath taught vs, and we beleeue that he is true, becauſe he is the trueth it ſelfe: and his Diſciples hath taught vs more at large: thus we doo vnderſtande of the power of his wiſedome.
            Wée beléeue that the word of God, and man, whom the that word of God put on, and the life of Chriſt in his fleſh was the life of man moſt holie, but the wiſedome of the power and workes of him, was the power of God.
            Wée beleeue, that as the ſoule and bodie is one man, ſo the word of God of one part, and of ye other part. The ſoule and the body, are two diſtinct natures perfectly in one mā, ſo is the humanitie and deitye in Chriſt, two diſtinct natures, knitte together according to Hypoſtaſes and perſonally, neither is the word of God chaunged into fleſh or into the ſoule of Chriſt, neither is the fleſh of Chriſt, or his ſoule conuerted into the word of God, but the word of God was and is in Chriſt the word of God, by a meruailous diſputation, humanity, humanitie: and that the humanitie

haue not taken the deitie of the worde of Chriſte, but the deitie of the worde of God hath taken mans nature, which conſiſteth in that, for as much as it was taken.
            Whatſoeuer thing is in God, and of God naturally, is God, becauſe there is nothing accidentall in God: and therefore we name and beleeue the intellectuall worde of God, to be God: and becauſe this worde of GOD was in Chriſte, for that cauſe wee confeſſe Chriſte to bee God and man: man, becauſe he conſiſteth of ſoule and body: God, becauſe of the word of God, which is in him.
            we beleeue, that the word of God is in Chriſt, and in the world, and in heauen, and in God, and in the Father, wherefore the word of God is infinite, as God is infinite, begetting him, that is as much to ſay: thinking, and hath an infinite power. But in God after one manner, and in Chriſt after an other manner, and in the world, after another manner.
            We beléeue, that when God dooth communicate his goodnes and his grace to any creature, neuertheleſſe, it goeth not from him, but thereby he is more magnified, becauſe that the highneſſe of God, is made manifeſt by the vertue of his Creatures.
            The more excellent that the Creatour is, by greater communicating of his goodneſſe: ſo much the more the goodneſſe of God, and his loue towardes men, and hys power is declared.
            Wherefore the goodnes of God, and his loue towardes men, is more magnified in this point, that God himſelfe hath come into Ieſus Chriſt, with his omnipotentcie, then that which he ſent into his Prophets one of his graces or two, and in ſome one Prophet a leſſer grace, and into ſome other a greater.
            We beleeue that Chriſt was crucified and dyed, of hys owne proper will, for many and great profittes, to the declaration

whereof, we ſhould occupy many wordes: and he hath ſuffered all theſe thinges, according to that which was of man in him.
            As for the word of God, it is neither crucifyed, neyther dyeth, neither ryſeth againe: But he rayſeth vp the deade as hee raiſeth vp his owne fleſhe which he bare. We beleeue, that Chriſt, after his reſurrection was aſſumpted vp into the heauens, and ſhall come againe with glorye, to iudge the quicke and the dead.
            Wée beleeue that mens ſoules are immortall, and that the bodyes of holy men, ſhall ryſe incorrupt, cleere, actiue, neither ſhall they haue any neede of meate, nor drinke, nor apparrell, nor any other corporall pleaſures: and that Soules immortall. the ſoules and the bodies, of them that haue beleeued, and haue ledde theyr life vertuouſly, ſhall goe into Paradiſe: but the impenitent, wicked, and Infideles, into puniſhment: and that the Paradiſe of the Saintes, and the fruicion thereof, is in heauen: the puniſhment of the wicked in the earth: and that the fruition of the Saints is no thing els, then that ſuch ſoules ſhalbe perſit in knowledge, and ſhall beholde the miſteries of God, which they knowe not nowe, but by faith onelie.
            Wherefore it was neceſſarie that the word of God, and God to be incarnate: many other thinges are neceſſarie, when neceſſity requireth, we are ready to render a reaſon thereof: after theſe reaſons, the ſeuen certifie vs of our Faith.
            Moreouer, the Prophets of the Iewes, haue ſhewed before, whom we receyue, of this Ieſus, what ſoeuer hee hath doone, or whatſoeuer haue béene doone, and whatſoeuer his diſciples haue doone by his power: The like the Oracles of the Greekes haue foreſhewed by the gift of God, and the like did the Aſtronomers of the Perſians and of the Grecians, with the preaching of Ieſus.
            For all theſe of the which we haue made mention, doo

agrée and are conſonant to the ſcripture in all thinges, becauſe that they which haue written them, haue had alone Doctor, or teacher, euen the grace of God: vnleſſe it were ſo in ſomething they would haue diſagréed, and haue béene diſſonant.
            Becauſe they haue receiued ſuch a fayth and relygion, although newe and miraculous, men with great diligence in eu

               , and with manifolde daungers, as well pri

                  〈…〉
               dent and wiſe: and by this meanes the malicious deceite of deuils was ouerthrowne. This faith and religion conteineth nothing impoſſible, neither any thing that is diſſonant with it ſelfe, neither any corporall thing, but all ſpirituall: and it is the way which leadeth mens ſoules vnto the loue of God, and of euerlaſting life.
            So many as haue receiued this faith, and haue lyued bertuouſly, according to the Lawe of Chriſt, haue obtayned great gifts of God, and haue doone many miracles, which thin 
                  •
               es could neuer haue come to paſſe, if this faith had beene falſe and vntrue. The Kinges which made war againſt this faith, with great ſlaughter and puniſhment throughout the worlde, many hundred yeeres, notwithſtanding that they had many Gods, profited nothing, but the faith had the victory, and continueth vnto this day: when the Lord ſhall come, he ſhall finde it: and vnleſſe that this faith had beene by the will of God, then had it beene eaſily ouerthrowne. To the ſame Ieſus our Lorde, the true God, be glory. Amen.
            Thus we affirme breefly as concerning our Faith.
