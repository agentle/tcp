                  〈◊〉
                troubled with the assaults of Sathan
            
            
               To the tune of Roger
            
            
               
            
            
               IN slumbring slléepe I lay
               all night alone in bed,
               A vision very strange
               there came into my head,
            
            
               Me thought the day of doome
               vndoubtedly was come,
               And Christ himselfe was there
               to iudge both all and some.
            
            
               My selfe was sent for there
               with sound of Trumpet shrill,
               Which said, All soules come heare
               your sentence good or ill.
            
            
               I sate in minde amaz'd,
               at that same sudden voyce,
               For in mine owne good life
               no whit I could reioyce.
            
            
               With panting brest I paus'd
               at that same sudden sight,
               Not trusting to my selfe,
               but to Christs mercies great.
            
            
               I was no sooner meant,
               but Sathan came, me thought,
               With him a role full large
               of all my life he brought▪
               
            
            
               And laid before the Lord
               how that I was his owne,
               And would haue had me then,
               my sinnes so great were growne
            
            
               I quaking lay with feare,
               and wist not what to doe,
               But in the blood of Christ
               I trusted still vnto.
            
            
               Then said our Sauiour Christ,
               foule Sathan end thy strife▪
               
               Looke if the sinners name
               be in the booke of life.
            
            
               If he be entred there,
               then must he needes be blest,
               His sinnes be washt away,
               his soule with me shall rest.
            
            
               Then Sathan tooke the booke,
               did leafe by leafe vnfold,
               And there he found my name
               in letters limb'd with gold.
            
            
               Then Sathan sorrowed much
               at that same sudden sight.
               And said vnto the Lord,
               thy Iudgements are not right
            
            
               And thus our Sauiour swéet
               said to him by and by,
               Thou, Sathan, know'st full well
               that I for sinne did dye.
            
            
               Redéeming all the world,
               once ouerthrowne by thée,
               And so will saue all such
               as truly trust in me.
            
            
               My mortall foe was wroth,
               that he had lost his prey,
               Extreamely vexed was,
               and vanisht quite away▪
               
            
            
               But I that thus was bill'd
               within that blessed booke,
               Out of my stumbring sleepe
               so ioyfully awoke.
            
            
               Still praying to the Lord,
               that alwayes sinners may
               From Sathan be set frée,
               at the last dreadfull day.
            
            
               That after earthly toyles,
               we may heauen ioyes attaine,
               Here learne to liue to d

               that we may liue againe.
            
            
               Our noble royall King.
               God grant him long to raigne
               To liue in ioy and peace,
               the Gospell to maintaine.
