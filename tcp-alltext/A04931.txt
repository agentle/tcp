preached by Iohn Knox
Minister of Christ Iesus in the
Publique audience of the Church of
Edenbrough, within the Realme of
Scotland, vpon Sonday, the .19.
of August .1565. For the which the said Iohn Knoxe
was inhibite preaching
for a season.
                  1. Timoth. 4.
¶The time is come that men
can not abyde the Sermon of
veritie nor holsome doctrine. To this is adioyned an exhortation vnto all
the faythfull within the sayde Realme, for
the reliefe of suche as faythfully trauayle
in the preaching of Gods worde. Written
by the same Iohn Knoxe, at the commaundement
of the ministerie aforesayd.

            IOHN KNOXE THE
seruaunt of Iesus Christ,
Inpreaching of his holy Euangell, to the
beneuolent Reader, desireth grace and
peace, with the spirite of righteous
Iudgement.
            
               WONDER NOT,
christian Reader
that of al my studye
and trauayle
within the scriptures
of GOD
these twentye yeares, I haue set
forth nothing in exponing anye
portion of scripture, except this
onely rude and indigest Sermon
preached by me in the publicke
audiēce of the church of Edingbrough
the day and yeare aboue
mēcioned. That I did not in writ
communicate my iudgemēt vpon
the scriptures, I haue euer
thought and yet thinke my selfe

to haue most iust reason. For cō
               sidering
my selfe rather cald of
my God to instruct the ignorant,
comfort the sorowfull, confirme
the weake, and rebuke the proud
by tong & liuelye voyce in these
most corrupt dayes, thā to compose
bokes for the age to come,
seeing that so much is written (&
that by men of most singuler cō
               dition)
and yet so little well obserued:
I decreed to containe my
selfe within the bondes of that
vocation, wherevnto I founde
my selfe especially called. I dare
not denie (lest that in so doing I
should be iniurious to the giuer)
but that God hath reuealed vnto
me secretes vnknowen to the
worlde, and also that he hath
made my tong a trumpet to forwarne
realmes and nations, yea
certaine great personages, of mutations
and chaunges, when no

such thinges were feared, nor yet
was appearing, a portion wherof
can not the world denie (be it neuer
so blind) to be fulfilled, and
the rest (alas) I feare shall followe
with greater expedition and in
more full perfection, than my
sorowfull heart desireth. These
reuelations and assurances not
withstanding, I did euer absteyne
to commit anye thing to
writ, contented onely to haue
obeyed the charge of him, who
commaunded me to cry. If anye
then will aske to what purpose
this onely sermon is set forth, &
greater matters omitted, I answere,
to let such as Sathan hath
not altogether blinded see, vpon
how small occasions, great offence
is nowe conceyued. This
sermon is it for the which from
my bed I was called before the
Councell: and after long reasoning,

I was by some forbidden to
preach in Edingbrough so long
as the King and Queene were in
the towne. This sermon is it that
so offēdeth such as would please
the Court, and yet will not appeare
to be enimies to the truth,
that thei dare affirme that I haue
exceded the bonds of Gods messanger.
I haue therfore faithfully
committed vnto writ, what
soeuer I could remember might
haue beene offensiue in that sermon.
To the ende that aswell
the enimies of Gods truth, as the
professors of the same, may eyther
note vnto me wherin I haue
offended, or at the least ceasse to
condempne me before they haue
conuicted me by Gods manifest
worde. If any man thinke it easy
vnto me to mitigate by my pen
the inconsiderate sharpenesse of
my tongue, and so can not men

freely iudge of that my sermon, I
answere that neyther am I so impudent
that I will study to abuse
the worlde, in this great light,
neyther yet so voyde of feare of
my God, that I will auowe a lye
in his owne presence. And no
lesse doe I esteeme it to be a lye,
to deny or cōceile that which in
his name I haue once pronounced,
than to affirme that GOD
hath spoken, when his worde assures
me not of the same, for in
the publike place I consulte not
with flesh and bloud what I shall
propone to the people, but as the
spirit of my God who hath sent
me and vnto whome I must answere,
moueth me, so I speake,
and when I haue once pronounced
threatnings in his nāe (howe
vnpleasant soeuer they be to the
world) I dare no more deny thē,
than I dare deny that God hath

made me his messinger to forwarne
the inobedient of their
assured destruction. At that sermō
were auditours vnto me not
onely professors of the truth and
such as fauor me, but rancke papistes,
dissembled Hipocrites, &
no small number of couetous
clawbaks of the new court. Now
I will appeale the conscience of
them all, as they will aunswere
in the presēce of the eternal god,
that eyther they beare me record
now writing the truth, or els note
vnto me the sentences offensiue
then by me pronounced, & now
ommitted in writting, for in
Gods presence I protest that so
far as memorie would serue me,
I haue written more vehemētly,
than in the action I spake and
pronounced, but of purpose I
haue omitted persuasions and
exhortations which then were

made for alluring of suche vnto
the feare of God, whom gladly I
would haue pleased, if so I could
haue done, & not haue betrayed
the manifest truth of my God.
The Lorde be mercifull vnto me
that I did not more fullye expresse
whatsoeuer his holy spirit
layde before me, in that text,
which I am assured the indifferent
reader shal think I haue but
slenderlye handeled, all circumstances
being cōnsidered. O Lord
for thy great name sake giue vnto
vs Princes and rulers that delight
in thy truth, that loue vertue,
hate impietie, and that desire
rather to be roundely taught
to their saluation, than deceyueably
flattered to their euerlasting
confusion. Amen.

                  13 O Lorde our God, other Lordes beside
thee haue ruled vs, but we will remē
                     ber
thee onely and thy name.
                  14 The dead shal not lyue, neyther shal
the dead arise, bicause thou hast visited
and scattered them and destroyed all their
memorie.
                  15 Thou hast increased the nation, O
Lorde: thou hast increased the nation,
thou art made glorious: thou hast enlarged
all the coastes of the earth.
                  16 Lorde in trouble haue they visited
thee: they poured out a prayer when thy
chastening was vpon them.
                  17 Like as a woman with childe that
draweth nere to the trauaile is in sorrowe,
and cryeth in her paines, so haue we beene
in thy sight O Lorde.
                  18 We haue conceyued, we haue borne
in paine as though we shuld haue brought
winde: there was no helpe in the
forth neyther did the inhabitants of the
earth,

worlde fall.
                  19 Thy deade men shall liue: euen
with my bodye shall they rise, awake
and sing ye that dwell in dust: for thy
dewe is as the dew of herbes and the earth
shall cast out the dead.
                  20 Come my people enter thou into thy
chambers, and shut thy dores after thee
hide thy selfe for a verie little while vntill
the indignation passe ouer.
                  For loe the Lorde commeth out of his
place to visite the iniquitie of the inhabitants
of the earth vpō them: and the earth
shall disclose her bloude, and shall no more
hide her slayne.
               
            
            
            A SERMON PREACHED by Iohn knoxe.
            
               AS THE CONninge Maryner
beinge Maister,
hauing his ship
tossed with vehemēt tempest,
and windes cō
               trarious,
is compelled oft to trauerse,
leaste that eyther by too
much resisting to the violence
of the waues, his vessell might
be ouerwhelmed, or by to much
libertie graunted, to be carried
whither the furie of the tempest
would, his ship should be driuen
vpon the shore, & so make shipwrack:
Euē so doth our prophet
I saiah in thys texte which presentely
ye haue heard read. For
he foreseing the gret desolation
that was decreed in the counsell
of the eternal, against Ierusalem

and Iudah, to weete, that the
whole people that bare the nāe
of GOD should be dispersed,The dispotion.
that the holy city should be destroyed,
the temple wherein was
the Ark of couenant, and where
GOD had promised to giue his
owne presence, should be brent
with her, the King taken, his sō
               nes
in his owne presence murdered,
his owne eyes immediately
after to be put out, the nobility,
some cruelly murdered, some
shamefully lead away captiues,
and finally the whole sede of Abraham,
rased as it were, frō the
face of the earth, the Prophet (I
say) fearing these horrible calamities,
doth as it were, some times
suffer himselfe and the people
committed to his charge, to
be carried awaye with the violence
of the tēpest, with out further
resistance, than by pouring

forth his and their dolorous cō
               playntes,
before the maiestie of
GOD, as in the 13 .17. and .18.
verse of this presēt text we may
reade. At other times he valiantly
resisteth the desperat tempest,
and pronounceth the fearfull
destruction of all suche, as
trouble the Churche of GOD,
which he pronoūceth that God
wil multiply, euen in such time
as when it appeareth vtterly to
be exterminate. But, bycause
ther is no final rest to the whole
body, till that the head returne
to iudgement, he calleth the afflicted
to pacience, and promyseth
such a visitation, as wherby
the wickednesse of the wicked
shal be disclosed, and finally recompenced
in their owne bosomes.
            These are the chiefest poyntes
which by the grace of God,

we intende more largely at thy
                  •
               
present to entreate.
            First the Prophet sayth: O Lord our God,Ver. 13.,
other Lordes besydes thee haue ruled vs.
            This no doubte, is the beginning
of the dolorous complaint
in the which he first cōplayneth
of the vniuste tirannye that the
poore afflicted Israelites sustayned,
during the time of their
captiuitie. True it is that the
Prophet was gathered to his Fathers
in peace, before that this
extremitie apprechēded the people.
For a hundreth yeare after
his deceasse, was not the people
lead away captiue, yet he foreseing
the assurance of the calamitie,
did before hande endite
vnto them the complaynt that
after they shoulde make. But at
the firste sight it appeareth that

the cōplaint hath small waight.
For what newe thing was it that
other Lordes than GOD in hys
owne person ruled them, seeing
that suche had bene their regiment
from the beginning. For
who knoweth not that Moyses,
Aaron, & Iosua, the Iudges, Samuell,
Dauid, and other godly
rulers, were men, and not God.
And so other Lordes than God,
ruled them in their gretest prosperitie.
            For the better vnderstanding
of this complaynte, and of the
minde of the Prophete, we must
first obserue from whence al authoritie
and dominion floweth▪
And secondly, to what ende powers
are appointed of God. The
which two poynts being discussed,
we shall the better vnderstande,
what Lordes, and what
authority rules beside God, and

who are they in whom God and
his mercifull presence rules.
            The firste is resolued to vs by
the words of the apostle, saying,
There is no power but of God.
Dauid bringeth in the eternall
God speaking to Iudges and rulers,Psal. 82.
saying, I haue sayde ye are
Gods, & the sonnes of the most
highest. And Salomon in the
person of GOD, affirmeth the
same, saying: By me Kings raygne,
and Princes discerne the
thinges that are iuste. Of which
places it is euidēt, that it is neither
birth, influence of Starres,
election of people, force of armes,
not finally what soeuer can
be comprehēded vnder the power
of nature, that maketh the
distinction betwixt the superior
power and the inferior, or that
doth establish the royall throne
of Kings, but it is the onely and

perfect ordinance of God, who
willeth his power, terror & Maiestie
in a parte to shine in the
thrones of Kings, and in the faces
of his Iudges, and that for
the profite and comfort of man,
so that who soeuer would study
to deface that order of regimēt,
that God hath established, and
by his holy worde allowed, and
bring in such a confusion, as no
difference shuld be betwyxt the
vpper powers and the subiects,
doth nothing but euert & turne
vpside downe the very throne
of God, which he wil to be fixed
here vpon earth, as in the ende
and cause of this ordināce more
playnly shall appeare, which is
the seconde poynte, we haue to
obserue for the better vnderstā
               ding
of the Prophets words and
minde.
            The end and cause then, why

God prynteth in the weake and
feble flesh of man this Image of
his own power & maiesty, is not
to puffe vp flesh in opinion of it
selfe, neyther yet that the heart
of him that is exalted aboue others,
shall be lifted vp by presumption
and pryde, and so despise
others, but that he shal cō
               sider
that he is appoynted Lieutenaunt
to one, whose eyes cō
               tinually
watch vpon him, to see
and examine howe he behaueth
himself in his office,Rom. 13. Saint Paul
in fewe words declareth the end
wherefore the sword is committed
to the powers, saying, it is
to the punishmēt of the wycked
doers, and vnto the prayse of
such as do well.
            Of which words it is euident
that the sword of God is not cō
               mitted
to the hande of man, to
vse as it pleaseth him, but only

to punishe vice, and maintayne
vertue, that mē may liue in such
societie, as before God is acceptable.
And this is the very and
onely cause why God hath appoynted
powers in this earth.
            For such is the furious rage of
mans corrupt nature, that vnles
seuere punishment were appointed
and put in execution vpon
malefactours, better it were that
man shoulde liue among brute
and wilde beastes, than among
men. But at this presente I dare
not enter into the descriptiō of
this common place, for so shuld
I not satisfie the text, which by
gods grace I purpose to absolue.
This onely by the way I would,
that such as are placed in authoritie
shoulde consider, whether
they raygne and rule by God, so
that God ruleth them, or if they
rule without, besides and against

God, of whom our Prophet here
doth complayne.
            If any lust to take trial of this
poynt,Deut. 17. it is not hard: for Moses
in the election of Iudges, and of
a King, describeth, not onelye
what persones shall be chosen to
that honour, but doth also giue
to him that is elected and chosē,
the rule by the which he shal trie
himselfe whether God raygne in
him or not, saying: when he shal
sit vpō the throne of his kingdō,
he shal write to himself an examplar of this lawe in a boke by the
priests the Leuits, it shal be with
him and he shall reade therin all
the dayes of his life, that he may
learne to feare the Lord his god,
and to kepe all the words of this
law & these statuts▪ that he may
do them, that his hart be not lifted
vp aboue his brethrē, & that
he turne not from the cōmaundement
to the right hand or to

the left.
            Thesame is repeated to IosuaIosua. 1.
in his inanguration to the regiment
of the people by God himselfe,
saying: let not the boke of
this lawe depart fro thy mouth,
but meditate in it day & night,
that thou mayst kepe and do according
to al that which is written
in it. For then shall thy way
be prosperous, and thou shalt do
prudently.
            The first thing thē that god craueth
of him that is called to the
honor of a king,What is required of a King or Prince. is the knowlege
of his wil reuealed in his word.
            The second is an vpright and
willing minde to put in execution
suche things as God commaundeth
in his lawe, without
declyning eyther to the right, or
left hande.
            Kings then haue not an absolute
power to do in their regimēt
what pleaseth them,The authoritie & power of kings is Limmitted., but their

power is limitted by gods word.
So that if they strike where god
commaundeth not, they are but
murderers, & if they spare, wher
GOD commaundeth to strike,
they and their throne are criminal
and giltie of the wickednesse
that aboundeth vpon the face
of the earth, for lacke of punishment.
            O if Kings and Princes shuld
consider what accompt shall be
craued of them, as well of their
ignoraunce and misknoweledge
of Gods will, as for the neglecting
of their office But nowe to
returne to the words of the Prophet.
In the person of the whole
people he doth complayne vnto
God, that the Babilonians (whō
he calleth other Lordes besydes
God, both bycause of their ignoraunce
of God, and by reason
of their crueltie and inhumanitie)

hadde long ruled ouer them
in all rigor, without pitie or cō
               compassion
had vpon the aunciente
men, and famous matrones.
For they being mortall enimies
of the people of God, sought
by all meanes to aggrauate
their yoke, yea, vtterlye to haue
exterminate the memorie of thē
and of their religion, from the
face of the earth.
            After the first part of this dolorous
complaynt, the Prophete
declareth the protestation of the
people, saying, neuerthelesse,
onely in thee shall we remember
thy name (others reade it, Put
wee wyll remember thee onelye and thy
name) But in the Hebrew there is
no Coniunction copulatiue in
that sentence. The minde of the
Prophete is playne, to wit, that
not withstanding the long sustayned
affliction, the people of

God declyned not to a false and
vayne religion, but remembred
God that sometime appeared to
them in his mercifull presence,
which albeit then they saw not,
yet would they still remēber his
name, that is, they would cal to
minde the doctrine and promise
which sōetimes they hard, albeit
in their prosperity, they did not
sufficiently glorifie God, who so
mercifully ruled in the midst of
them. The temptation no doubt
of the whole Isralites was gret in
those dayes. They were caryed
captiues from the land of Canaan,
which was to thē the gage &
pledge of Gods fauour towardes
thē. For it was the inheritaunce
that God promised to Abrahā &
to his seede for euer. The league
& couenant of Gods protection
appeared to haue beene broken.
They lamentably cōplayne that
they sawe not their accustomed

signes of Gods merciful presēce.
The true prophets were fewe, &
the abhominatiōs vsed in Babylon
were exceding many. And so
it might haue apered to thē, that
in vayne it was, that they were
called the posteritie of Abrahā,
or that euer they had receyued
law or form of right religion frō
god. That we may the better fele
it in our selues, the temptatiō, I
say, was euē such, as if God shuld
vtterly destroy al order & policy
that this day is withī his church,
that the true preaching of the
worde should be suppressed. The
right vse of sacramēts abolished,
Idolatry & papistical abhomination
erected vp again. And therwith,
that our bodies should be
takē prisoners by Turks or other
manifest enimies of God & of al
Godlynesse▪ Such I say was their
temptatiō. How notable then is
this their cōfessiō that in bōdage

they make, to wit, that they wil
remember God onely, albeit he
hath appeared to turne his face
from them, they will remember
hys name, and will cal to minde
the deliuerance promised.
            Hereof haue we to consider
what is our duetie, if God bring
vs (as for oure offences and vnthankfulnesse
iustely he may) to
the like extremitie. This confession
is not the fayre flattering
wordes of hypocrites, lying and
bathing in their pleasures, but it
is the mightye operation of the
spirite of God, who leaueth not
his owne destitute of some comfort
in their most desperate calamities.The dutie of Gods people This is then oure duety,
not onely to confesse our god in
the time of peace and quietnes,
but he chiefely craueth that we
auowe him, in the middeste of
his and our enimies. And this is

to doe, but it behoueth that the
spirite of God worke in vs aboue
all power of nature. And thus we
ought earnestlye to meditate before
the battayle rise more vehement,
which appeareth not to be
farre of, but now must we enter in
somewhat more deepely to consider
these iudgements of God.
            This people entreated as we
haue heard, was the onely people
vpon the face of the earth, to whō
God was rightly knowen, among
them onely were his lawes, statuts,
ordinaunces, and sacrifices
vsed, and put in practise. They
onely inuocated his name, and to
them alone, had he promised his
protection and assistance. What
then shoulde be the cause, that he
shoulde giue them ouer into this
great reproche, and bring them
into suche extremitie, as his owne
name in them shoulde be blasphemed.

The Prophet, Ezekiell, that
saw this horrible destruction forespoke
by Isaiah put in iust execution,
giueth an aunswere, in these
wordes.
                  
                     •
                  che. 20. I gaue vnto them lawes
that were good, in the which, whosoeuer
shoulde walke, should liue
in them. But they woulde not
walke in my wayes, but rebelled
against me, and therefore, I haue
giuen vnto them lawes, that are
not good, and iudgements, in the
which they shal not liue The writer
of the bookes of kings and cronicles
declare this in more playne
words, saying: the Lorde sent vnto
them his prophets rising early,
desiring of them to retourne vnto
the Lorde, and to amende their
wicked wayes (for he would haue
spared his people and his tabernacle)
but they mocked his seruants,
and woulde not retourne vnto the
Lorde their God to walke in his

wayes.2. Reg. 17. Yea, Iuda it selfe kept not
the precepts of the Lord God, but
walked in the maners & ordinances of Israell: that is, of suche as
then had declyned to Idolatry frō
the dayes of Ieroboam. And therfore
the Lorde God abhorred the
whole seede of Israell, that is, the
whole body of the people, he promised
them and gaue them into
the hands of those, that spoyled
them, and so he cast them out frō
his presence.
            Hereof, it is euident, that their
stubborne disobedience vnto God
and vnto the voyces of hys Prophetes,
was the cause of their destruction.
Nowe haue we to take
heede how we should vse the good
lawes of God, that is, his mercifull
will reuealed vnto vs in his
worde, and that order of iustice,
that by him for the comforte of
man is established among men. It

is no doubt, but that obedience,
is the moste acceptable sacrifice
vnto God, and that which aboue
all things he requireth, that when
he manifesteth himselfe by hys
worde, that men follow according
to their vocation and commaundement.
Now so it is, that God by
that great pastor out Lorde Lesus,
nowe manifestly in his worde calleth
vs from all impietie, aswell of
body, as of minde; to holynesse of
life, and to his spirituall seruice.
And for this purpose, he hath erected
the throne of his mercy among
vs the true preaching of his word,
together with the right administration
of his sacramet, but what
is our obedience. Let euery man
examine his owne conscience, and
consider what statuts and lawes we
woulde haue to be giuen vnto vs.
            Wouldst thou O Scotland haue
a King to raigne ouer thee in iustice,

equitie, and mercy? Subiect
thou thy selfe to the Lorde thy
God, obey his commaundements,
and magnifie thou that word that
calleth vnto thee. This is the way,
walke into it, and if thou wilt not,Isai.,
flatter not thy self, the same iustice
remaineth this day in God to punishe
thee Scotlande, and thee Edenborough in especiall, that before
punished the lande of Iuda,
and the citie of Ierusalem. Euerie
realme or nation (sayth the Prophet
Ieremy) that likewise offendeth,Iere. 9.
shall be likewise punished.
But if thou shalt see impietie placed
in the seate of iustice aboue
thee,Eccle. 3. so that in the throne of God
(as Salomon doth cōplayne) raigneth
nothing but fraude and violēce,
accuse thy owne ingratitude
and rebellion against God. For
that is the onely cause,Isa. 3., why God
taketh away (as the same Prophet

in another place doth speake) the
strong man and the man of warre,
the Iudge, and the Prophete, the
prudent, & the aged, the captaine,
and the honorable, the counceller
and the cunning artificer. And I
wil appoint, sayth the Lorde, children
to be their princes, and babes
shal rule ouer them. Children are
extorcyoners of my people, and
women haue rule ouer them.
            If these calamities, I saye, apprehend
vs so that we see nothing, but
the oppression of good men, and
of all godlynesse, and wicked men
without God, to raigne aboue vs:
Let vs accuse and condempne our
selues, as the onely cause of oure
owne miseries. For if we had heard
the voyce of the Lord our God, &
giuen vpright obedience vnto the
same, God should haue blessed vs,
he shoulde haue multiplyed oure
peace, and shoulde haue rewarded

our obedience before the eyes of
the worlde. But nowe let vs heare
what the Prophet sayth further.
            The dead shall not liue,Verse. 14. sayth be, neyther
shall the tiraunts, or the dead arise, bicause
thou hast visited and scattered them, and destroyed all their memorie.
            Frō this .14. verse vnto the end of
the .19. it apeareh that the Prophet
obserueth no order, yea, that he
speaketh thinges directly repugning
one to another. For first he
sayth the dead shal not liue. After,
he affirmeth, thy dead men shall
lyue.Verse. 15. Secondly he sayth, thou hast
visited and scattered them, & destroyed
all their memorie. Imediately
thereafter he sayth, thou hast
increased the natiō O Lord, thou
haste increased the nation. They
haue visited thee, and haue poured
forth a prayer before thee.
            Who, I say, woulde not thinke,

that these are thinges not onely
spoken forth of good order and
purpose, but also manifestly repugning
one to another. For, to
liue, and not to liue, to be so destroyed
that no memoriall remaineth.
And to be so increased, that
the coastes of the earth shal be replenished,
seme to importe playne
contradiction. For remouing of
this doubt, and for better vnderstanding
of the Prophetes minde,
we must vnderstand that the Prophet
had to doe with diuers forts
of mē. He had to do with the coniured
& manifest enimies of Gods
people, the Caldes or Babilonians,
euen suche as professe Christ
Iesus, haue to doe with the Turke
and Sarazens. He had to doe with
the sede of Abraham, wherof there
were three sorts. The tenne tribes
all degenerate from the true worshipping, and corrupted with Idolatry,

as this daye, are our pestilent
papistes in al realmes and nations.
            There rested onely the tribe of
Iuda and Ierusalē, where the forme
of true religion was obserued, the
lawe taught, and ordinaunces of
god outwardly kept, but yet there
were in that body (I meane in the
bosome of the visible Church) a
great number that were hipocrits,
as this day yet are among vs, that
doe professe the Lorde Iesus and
haue refused papistrie, not a fewe
that were lycentious lyuers, some
that had tourned their backe to
God, that is had forsaken al true
religion, and some that liued a
most abhominable life,Ezech. 8. as Ezechiell
sayeth in his vision. And yet
there were some godlye as a fewe
wheat cornes oppressed and hid amōg
the multitude of such chaffe.
Nowe according to this diuersitie,
the Prophete kepeth diuers purposes

and yet in moste perfecte
order.
            And first after the first part of the
complaint of the afflicted, as we
haue heard, in vehemencie of spirite
he bursteth forth against all
the proude enimies of Gods people,
all such as trouble them, and
against all such as mocke and forsake
God, and sayth: the dead shal
not liue. The proud Giants shall
not arise. Thou hast scattered thē
and destroyed their memoriall. In
which wordes he fighteth against
the present temptation, and dolorous
estate of Gods people, and
against the insolent pride of suche
as oppressed them, as the Prophet
should say. O ye troublers of Gods
people, howsoeuer it appeareth
to you in this your bloudy rage,
that God regardeth not your crueltie,
not considereth not what
violence ye doe to his pore afflicted,

yet shal ye be visited, yea, your
carcases shal fal and lye as stinking
carions vpon the face of the earth,
ye shal fal without hope of life, or
of a blessed resurrection. Yea, howsoeuer
ye gather your substance
& augment families, ye shal be so
scattered, that ye shal leaue no memoriall
of you to the posterities to
come, but that which shal be execrable
and odious.
            Hereof haue the tirauntes their
admonition, & the aflicted church
inestimable comfort. The tiraunts
that now doe oppresse, shal receiue
the same end that they which haue
passed before, that is, they shal dye
and fal with shame without hope
of resurrection as is aforesayd, not
that they shall not arise to their
owne confusion & iust condempnation,
but that they shal not recouer
power to trouble the seruants
of God, neyther yet shal the

wicked arise as Dauid sayth, in the
councell of the iust.
            Now haue the wicked their coū
               cels,
their thrones, & finally handeling
for the most part of al things
that are vpon the face of the earth,
but the pore seruāts of God are reputed
vnworthy of mens presence,
yea they are more vile before these
proude tyraunts, than is very dirt
and mire that is troden vnder fote.
But in that glorious resurrection,
this estate shal be changed. For thē
shal such as now by their abhominable
liuing and crueltie,Apoca. destroy
the earth & molest gods children,
see him whome they haue pearced.
They shal see the glory of such, as
now they persecute, to their terror
and euerlasting confusion. The remembrance
hereof ought to make
vs patient in the dayes of affliction,
and so to comfort vs, that whē
we see tiraunts in their blind rage

tread vnder fote the saints of god,
that vtterlye we dispaire not, as
that there were neyther wisedom,
iustice, nor power aboue in the
heauens to represse such tirannie,
and to redresse the dolors of the
vniustly afflicted. No brethrē, let
vs be assured that the right hand
of the Lorde will change the state
of thinges that be most desperate.
In our God there is wisedome and
power in a moment to change the
ioy and mirth of our enimies, into
euerlasting mourning, and our
sorrowes into ioye and gladnesse
that shall haue no ende.
            Let vs therefore in these apparant
calamities (and maruell not
that I say calamities apparant, for
he that seeth not a fier begonne,
that shal burne more than we loke
for, vnlesse God of his mercye
quench it, is moore than blinde.)
Yet I say, let vs not be discouraged,

but with vnfained repētance,
let vs retourne to the Lorde our
God, let vs accuse and condemne
our former negligence, and stedfastly
depende vpon his promised
deliuerance, and so shal our temporal
sorrowes, be conuerted into
ioye euerlasting, the doubt that
might be moued concerning the
destruction of those whome God
exalteth, shall be discussed if time
wil suffer, after that we haue passed
throughout the text. Now procedeth
the Prophet and sayth.
            Thou hast increased the nations,Verse. 15. O Lorde,
thou hast increased the nation, thou art made
glorious, thou hast inlarged all the coastes of
the earth.
            Lorde in trouble.Verse. 16. &c.
            In these wordes the Prophet giueth
consolation to the afflicted,
assuring them that howe horrible

soeuer that desolation shoulde be,
yet shoulde the seede of Abraham
be so multiplyed, that it should replenish
the coasts of the earth. Yea,
that God should be more glorified
in their dispersion, than he was during
the time of their prosperity:
This promise no doubt was incredible
when it was made. For who
coulde haue bene persuaded that
the destruction of Ierusalem, should
haue bene the meanes, wherby the
nation of the Iewes shoulde haue
bene increased, seing that muche
rather it appeared that the ouerthrow
of Ierusalem, shoulde haue
beene the verie abolishing of the
seede of Ahraham. But we muste
consider to what ende it was that
God reuealed himselfe to Abrahā,
and what is contayned in the promise
of the multiplication of his
seede, and of the benediction promised
therto.
            
               
First God reuealed himselfe to
Abraham, and that by the meanes
of his word, to let al flesh after vnderstande,
that without God first
cal man, and reueale himselfe vnto
him, that flesh can doe nothing
but rebell against God.
                  
                     •
                  osu. 24. For Abraham
no doubt was an Idolater before
that God called him from Vr
of the Caldeis. The promise was
made that the seede of Abraham
should be multiplyed as the starres
of heauen,Rom. 9. and as the sande of the
sea, which is not simply to be vnderstanded
of his natural seede, althoughe
it was sometymes greatly
increased, but rather of suche as
shoulde become the spiritual seede
of Abraham, as the Apostle speaketh:
Now if we be able to proue
that the right knowledge of God,
his wisedome, iustice, mercye, and
power, was more amply declared
in their captiuitie, than euer it was

at any tyme before: then can we
not deny, but that God euen when
to mans iudgement he had vtterly
rased them from the face of the
earth, did increase the nation of
the Iewes, so that he was glorified
in them, and did extend the coastes
of the earth for their habitation.
And for the better vnderstanding
hereof, let vs shortly try the histories
from their captiuitie to their
deliuerance, and after the same, to
the comming of the Messias. It is
no doubt, but that Sathan intended
by the dispersion of the Iewes
so to haue prophaned the whole
seede of Abraham, that among thē
should neyther haue remayned the
true knowledge of God, nor yet
the spirit of sanctificatiō. But that
all shoulde haue come to a like ignoraunce
and contempt of God.
            For I pray you, for what purpose
was it, that DanielDaniell. 1. and his fellowes

were taken into the Kings court,
were commaunded to be fed at the
Kings table, and were put to the
scholes of their diuines, South sayers
and Astrologians? it maye be
thought that it proceeded of the
Kinges humanitie, and of a zeale
that he had, that they shoulde be
brought vp in vertue & good learning.
And I doubt not, but it was
so vnderstanded of a great number
of the Iewes. But the secret practise
of the Diuell, was vnderstanded
of Danyell, when he refused
to defyle himselfe with the kings
meat, which was forbidden to the
seede of Abraham in the lawe of
their God. Well, God beginneth
shortly thereafter to shew himselfe
myndefull of his promise made by
his Prophete. And he beginneth
to trouble Nabuchodonezar himselfe,
by shewing to him a vision in
his dreame, which did the more

trouble him, bicause he could not
forget the terrour of it. Neyther
yet coulde he remember what the
vision, and the parcels therof were.
Wherupon were called al diuines,
Interpretors of dreames, & Southsayers,
of whom the King demaū
               ded,
if thei could let him vnderstād
what he had dreamed. But while
that they answere, that such a question
vsed not to be demaunded of
any Southsayer or Magitian: For
the resolution thereof onely appertained
to the Gods, whose habitation
was not with men: the
charge was giuen, that they all
should be slayne. And amongst the
rest DaniellDaniell. 2. was sought (whose innocencie,
the diuel most enuied) to
haue suffered the same iudgement.
He reclaymeth and asketh tyme to
disclose that secret. (I onely touch
the historie, to let you see by what
meanes God increaseth his knowledge)

which being graūted, the visiō
is reueled vnto him. He sheweth
the same vnto the king, with the
true interpretation of it. Adding,
that the knowledge thereof came
not from the starres, but only frō
the God of Abraham, who onely
was, and is, the true God▪ which
thing vnderstanded, the king burst
forth in his confession, saying, of
a truth your God is the moste excellent
of al Gods. And he is Lord
of kinges and onely he that reuealeth
the secretes, seeing that thou
couldest open this secret.
            And when the king after, puffed
vp in pride by the counsell of his
wicked nobilitie, would make an
Image, before the which he would
that al tongues and nations subiect
to him should make adoration, &
that Sydrack, Misacke and Abednago,
woulde not obey his vniust
commaundement, & so were cast

in the flaming furnace of fyre, and
yet by Godes Angels were so preserued,
that no smell of fier remayned
in their persons nor garments:
this same king giueth a more notable
confession, saying, the Lord
God of Sydrack, Misack & Abednago
is to be praysed, who hath
sent his Angels and deliuered his
worshippers, that put their trust in
him, who haue done against the
kings cōmaundement, who haue
rather giuen their owne bodyes to
torment,Daniell. 3. than that they woulde
worship another God except their
owne God. By me therfore is there
made a decree, that whosoeuer shal
blaspheme the God of Sydrack,
Misack & Abednago, that he shall
be cut in pieces, and his house shal
be made detestable.
            Thus we se how God began euen
almoste in the beginning of their
captiuitye, to notifie his name,

to multiply his knowledge, & set
forth aswel his power, as his wisedome
& true worshipping, by those
that were taken prisoners, yea that
were dispised and of all men contempned.
so that the name & feare
of the God of Abrahā, was neuer
before notified to so many realmes
& nations. This wōderous worke
of God proceeded from one Empire
to another. For Daniel being
promoted to great honor by Darius
king of Perses and Medes, falleth
into a desperat daūger. For he
was cōmitted to prisō among Lyons,Daniell. 6.
bicause that he was deprehended
breaking the kings iniunctiō,
not that the king desired the destruction
of Gods seruants, but bicause
the corrupt Idolaters, that
in hatred of Daniell had procured
that lawe to be made, vrged the
king against his nature. But God
by his Angell did stop the Lyons

mouthes, and so preserued his seruant.
Which considered with the
soddaine destruction of Daniels
enimies by the same Lyons, king
Daryus besides his owne confession,
wrote to all people, tongues,
and nations after this forme. It is
decreed by me that in all the dominions
of my kingdom men shal
feare and reuerence the God of
Danyell, bicause he is the liuing
God, abiding for euer, whose kingdome
shall not be destroyed, and
his dominion remayneth, who saueth
and deliuereth, and sheweth
signes and wonders in heauen and
in earth: who hath deliuered Daniell
from the Lyons.
            This knowledge was yet further
increased in the dayes of Cyrus,
who giuing freedome to the captiues
to returne to their owne natyue
cuntry, giueth this confessiō.
Thus sayth Cyrus the king of Persians,

all the kingdomes of the
earth hath the Lorde God of heauen
giuen vnto me,1. Esd. 1. and hath commaunded
me that a house be built
to him in Ierusalem, which is in
Iuda. Whosoeuer therefore of you
that are of his people, let the Lord
his God be with him, and let him
passe vp to Ierusalem, and let him
builde the house of the Lord God
of Israell, for he only is God that
is in Ierusalem. Time will not suffer
to intreate the poyntes of this
confession, neyther yet did I for
that purpose adduce the historie.
But onely to let vs see howe constantlye
God kept his promise in
increasing of his people, and in
augmēting of his true knowledge,
when that both they that were the
seede of Abraham, and that religion
which they professed appeared
vtterly to haue bene extinguished
aboue mens expectation, I say, he

brought fredome out of bondage,
light out of darkenesse, and lyfe
out of death. I am not ignoraunt
that the building of the temple &
reparation of the walles of Ierusalem,
were long stayed, so that the
worke had many enimies. But so
did the hande of God preuayle in
the ende, that a decree was giuen
by Daryus (by him I suppose that
succeded to Cambises) not onely
that all things necessarie for the
building of the temple and for
the sacrifices that were to be there
brent,1. Esd. 6. shoulde be ministred vpon
the kings charges: but also, that
whosoeuer shuld hinder that work,
or change that decree, that a balke
should be taken out of his house,
and that he should be hanged thervpon.
Yea that his house should be
made a donghil: and therto he addeth
a prayer saying.A prayer. the God of
heauen, who hath placed his name

there, roote out euerye king and
people (O that kings and nations
should vnderstande) that shall put
his hande eyther to change or to
hurte this house of God that is in
Ierusalem, and so in dispite of Sathan
was the temple builded, the
walles repayred, and the city inhabited,
and in the moste desperat
daungers, it was preserued, til that
the Messias promised, the glory of
the seconde temple came, manyfested
himselfe to the worlde, suffred
and rose againe according to
the scriptures. And so by sending
forth his gospell from Ierusalem,
did replenish the whole earth with
the true knowledge of God, and so
did God in perfectiō increase the
nation aud the spirituall seede of
Abraham.
            Wherefore deare brethren, we
haue no small consolation, if the
estate of all thinges be this daye

rightly considered, we see in what
furie and rage the worlde for the
moste parte is nowe raised against
the pore Church of Iesus Christ,
vnto the which, he hath proclaymed
liberty after this feareful bō
               dage
of that spirituall Babylon, in
the which we haue beene holden
captiues of longer space, than Israell
was prisoner in Babylon it
selfe. For if we shall consider vpon
the one parte the multitude of
those that liue without God: and
vpon the other parte, the blinde
rage of the pestilent papistes, what
shal we think of the small number
of them that do professe Christ Iesus,
but that they are as a poore
sheepe already seazed in the clawes
of the Lyon, yea, that they & the
true religion which they professe,
shall in a moment vtterly be consumed.
            But against this fearefull temptation,

let vs be armed with the
promise of our god, to wit, that he
wil be the protector of his church,
yea that he will multiply it, euen
when to mans iudgement, it appeareth
vtterly to be exterminate.
This promise hath our God performed
in the multiplication of
Abrahams seede, in preseruation
of it when Sathan labored vtterly
to haue destroied it, in deliuerance
of the same as we haue heard from
Babilon. He hath sent his sonne
Christ Iesus clad in our flesh, who
hath tasted of all our infirmities,
(sinne except) who hath promised
to be with vs to the ende of the
worlde. He hath further kept promise
in publication, yea in the restitution
of his gloryous gospell.
Shall we then thinke that he will
leaue his church destitute in this
moste daungerous age? Onely lee
vs sticke to his truth and studye to

conforme our lyues to the same,
and he shall multiply his knowledge
and increase his people, but
now let vs heare what the Prophet
sayth more.
            Lorde in trouble haue they visited thee,Verse. 16.
they poured out a prayer when they chastening
was vpon them.
            The Prophet meaneth that such
as in the time of quietnesse did not
rightly regard God nor his iudgements,
were compelled by sharpe
corrections to seeke God, yea by
cryes and dolorous complayntes,
to visit him. True it is that suche
obedience deserueth small praise
before men, for who can prayse or
accept that in good parte which
commeth as it were of mere compulsion.
And yet rare it is that any
of Gods children doe giue vnsayned
obedience vntill the hande of
God turne them. For if quietnesse

and prosperitie make them not
vtterly to forget their duety both
towardes God and man, as Dauid
for a season, yet it maketh them
carelesse, insolent, and in manye
things vnmindeful of those things
that God chiefly craueth of them,
which imperfection espied, and
the daunger that thereof might
ensewe, our heauenly father visiteth
the sinnes of his children, but
in the rodde of his mercye, by the
which they are moued to retourne
to their God, to accuse their former
negligence, and to promise
better obedience in all times therafter,Psal. 119.
as Dauid confesseth saying,
before I fell in affliction I went astray,
but now will I kepe thy statuts.
            But yet for the better vnderstā
               ding
of the Prophetes minde, we
may consider how God doth visit
man, and howe man doth visit

God, and what difference there is,
betwixt the visitation of God vpon
the reprobate, and his visitation
vpon the chosen.
            God sometymes visiteth the reprobate
in his hote displeasure,
pouring vpon them his plagues
for their long rebellion, as we haue
heard before, that he visited the
proud, and destroyed their memorie.
Other tymes, God is sayde to
visit his people being in affliction,
to whome he sendeth comforte or
promise of deliuerance, as he did
visit the seede of Abraham, being
oppressed in Egipt: and Zacharie
sayth, that God had visited his
people and sent vnto them hope
of deliueraunce, when Iohn the
Baptist, was borne. But of none
of these visitations speaketh our
Prophet here, but of that onely
which we haue already touched,
to wit, when that God layeth his

correction vpon his owne childrē,
to call them from the venemous
beastes of this corrupt worlde, that
they sucke not in ouer greate haboundance,
the poyson therof, &
doth as it were, weane them, from
their mothers paps, that they may
learne to receyue other norishmēt.
True it is that this weaning (or
spaning as we terme it) frō worldly
pleasure, is a thing straunge to
the flesh, and yet it is a thing so necessary
to Gods children, that onlesse
they be weaned frō the pleasures
of the world, they can neuer
feede vpon that delectable milke
of Gods eternall veritie. For the
corruption of the one doth eyther
hinder the other to be receyued, or
else so trobleth the whole powers
of man, that the soule can neuer
so digest the truth of God, as that
he ought to doe.
            Albeit this appeareth harde, yet

it is most euident. For what liquor
can we receyue from the breasts of
the world, but that which is in the
worlde, and what that is, the Apostle
Iohn teacheth,1. Iohn. 2. saying: what
soeuer is in the world, is either the
lustes of the eyes, the lustes of the
fleshe, or the pride of lyfe. Nowe
seeing that these are not of the father,
but of the worlde, howe can
it be, that our soules can feede vpon
chastitie, temperance, and humilitie,
so longe, as that our stomaks
are replenished with the corruption
of these vices.
            Now so it is that willingly fleshe
can neuer refuse these forenamed,
but rather still delyghteth it selfe
in euery one of them, yea, in them
all as the examples are but to euident.
            It behoueth therefore that God
himself shal violently pul his children
from these venemous breasts,

that when they lacke the liquor &
poyson of the one▪ they may visit
him and learne to be nourished of
him. Oh if the eies of worldly Princes
shoulde be opened, that they
might see with what humor and
lyquor their soules are fed, while
that their whole delight consisteth
in pryde, ambition, and lustes of
the stinking flesh. We vnderstande
then how God doth visite men, aswell
by his seuere iudgementes, as
by his mercifull visitation of deliuerance
from trouble or by bringing
trouble vpon his chosen for
their humiliation. And now it res
               
                  ••
               th
to vnderstand howe man visiteth
God: man doth visite God,
when he appeareth in his presence,
be it to the hearing of his worde, or
to the participation of his sacramentes,
as the people of Israell, besides
the obseruation of their Sabothes
and dayly oblations were

commaunded thrice a yeare to present
them selues before the presēce
of the tabernacle, and as we doe, as
often as we present our selues to
the hearing of the worde. For there
is the fotestole, yea, there is the face
and throne of God himself, whersoeuer
the gospell of Iesus Christ
is truely preached, and his sacraments
rightly ministred.
            But men maye on this sort visite
God hipocritically, for they maye
come for the fashion, they maye
heare with deafe eares, yea they
may vnderstand, and yet neuer determyne
with themselues to obey
that, which God requyreth. And
let such mē be assured that he (who
searcheth the secrets of hearts) wil
be auēged of al such. For nothing
can be to God more odyous, than
to mock him in is owne presence.
Let euery man therefore examine
himselfe, with what minde, and

what purpose, he cōmeth to heare
the worde of God, yea with what
care he heareth it, and what testimonie
his heart giueth vnto him,
when that God cōmaundeth vertue,
and forbiddeth impietie.
            Repinest thou when God requireth
obedience? Thou hearest to
thine owne cōdempnation. Mockest
thou at Gods threatenings?
Thou shalt feele the weight and
truth of them, albeit to late, when
flesh & bloude cannot deliuer thee
from his hande. But the visitation
(wherof our Prophet speaketh,) is
only proper to the sonnes of God,
who in the tyme when God taketh
from them the pleasures of the
world, or sheweth his angry countenaunce
vnto them, haue their
recourse vnto him, and confessing
their former negligence with troubled
hearts cry for his mercy. This
visitation is not proper to all afflicted,

but appertaineth onely to
Gods children. For the reprobate
can neuer haue accesse to Goddes
mercye in time of their tribulation,
and that bicause they abuse as
well his long pacience, as the manifolde
benefits they receiue from
his handes. For as the same Prophet
heretofore sayth, let the wicked
obtaine mercy, yet shal he neuer
learne wisedome, but in the
lande of righteousnesse, that is
where the very knowledge of God
aboundeth, he will doe wickedly,
which is a cryme aboue all others
abhominable. For to what ende is
it that God erecteth his throne among
vs? but for that we shoulde
feare him. Why doth he reueale
his holy will vnto vs? but that we
shoulde obey it. Why doth he deliuer
vs from trouble? but that we
shuld be witnesses vnto the world,
that he is gracious, and mercifull.
            
               
Nowe when that men hearing
their duety & knowing what God
requireth of them doe malepertly
fight against al equitie and iustice,
what I pray you doe they else but
make manifest warre against God,
yea when they haue receiued from
God suche deliuerance, that they
cannot deny, but that God himselfe
hath in his great mercye visited
them, and yet that they continew
wicked euen as before. What
deserue they? but effectually to be
giuen ouer into a reprobate sence,
that hedlong they may runne to
ruine both of body and soule. It is
almost incredible that man should
be so enraged against God, that
neyther his plagues, nor yet his
mercy shewed, should moue them
to repentaunce, but bicause the
scriptures beareth witnesse of the
one, and the other. Let vs cease to
meruell, and let vs firmely beleue

that such things as haue bene, are
euen presently before our eyes, albeit,
manye blinded by affection
can not see them.
            Ahab as in the boke of the kings
is written, receyued many notable
benefits of the hande of God, who
did visit him in diuers sortes, some
tymes by his plagues, sometimes
by his worde, and sometymes by
his merciful deliuerance. He made
him King: and for the Idolatry vsed
by him and by his wife, he plagued
whole Israell by famyne. He
reuealed to him his will and true
religion by the Prophet Helias, he
gaue vnto him sundry deliuerances,
but one moste speciall, when
proude Benhadab came to besiege
Samaria, and was not content to
receiue Ahabs gold, siluer, sonnes,
daughters, and wyues, but also required,
that his seruaunts shoulde
haue at their pleasure whatsoeuer

was delectable in Samaria: true it
is, that his elders, and people willed
him not to heare the proude
tirant. But who made vnto him
the promise of deliuerance? and
who appointed and put his armye
in order, who assured him of victorie.
The Prophet of God onely,
who assured him, that by the seruantes
of the Princes of the prouinces,
who in number were onely
232 he should deface that great armie,
in the which there were .32.
Kings with all their forces: As the
Prophete of God promised, so it
came to passe. Victorie was obtained,
not once only, but twice, and
that by the mercifull visitation of
the Lorde.
            But howe did Ahab visite God
againe▪ for his great benefit receyued.
Did he remoue his Idolatry,
did he correct his Idolatrous wife
Iesabel? No we find no such thing,

but the one, and the other, we find
to haue continued & increased informer
impietie.1. Reg. 22. But what was the
ende hereof? The last visitation of
God was, that dogges licked the
bloud of the one,2. Reg. 9. and did eate the
flesh of the other. In fewe wordes
then we may vnderstand, what difference
there is betwixt the visitation
of God vpō the reprobate,
and his visitation vpō his chosen.
The reprobate are visited, but neuer
truly humbled, nor yet amended.
The chosē being visited, they
sobbe, and they cry vnto God for
mercy (which obtained) they magnifie
Gods name, and after declare
the fruites of repentaunce. Let vs

                  •
               herefore that heare these iudge
               
                  •
               ents
of our God, call for the assistance
of his holy spirit, that how
soeuer it pleaseth him to visite vs,
that we may stoupe vnder his merciful
hands, and vnfainedly cry to

him when he correcteth vs. And
so shall we knowe in experience,
that our cryes & complaintes were
not in vayne, but let vs heare what
the Prophet sayth further.
            Lyke as a woman (sayth he) with childe
that draweth neere to the trauayle,Verse. 17. is in sorow
and cryeth in her paines, so haue we bene
in thy sight. O Lorde, we haue conceyued, we
haue borne in vayne, as thoughe we shoulde
haue brought forth the winde.
            Saluations were not made to the earth,
neyther,Verse. 18. did the Inhabitants of the earth fal.
            This is the seconde parte of the
Prophets complaint, in the which
he in the person of Gods people
complayneth, that of their great
affliction there appeared no ende.
This same similitude is vsed by our
master Iesus Christ,Iohn. 16. for when he
speaketh of the troubles of hys
church, he compareth them to the

paynes of a woman trauayling in
her childe birth. But it is to another
ende. For there he promiseth
exceding and permanent ioy, after
a sort, thoughe it appeare trouble.
But here is the trouble long & vehement,
albeit the fruite of it was
not sodainely espied. He speaketh
no doubt of that long & dolorous
tyme of their captiuitie, in the
which they continually trauayled
for delyuerance, but obtained it
not before the compleate ende of
70 yeares. During the which time,
the earth, that is the land of Iuda,
which sometymes was sanctified
vnto God, but was then giuen to
be prophaned by wicked people,
gat no helpe. Nor perceyued any
deliuerance. For the Inhabitants
of the world fell not, that is, the tirantes
and oppressors of gods people,
were not taken away, but still
remayned and continued blasphemers

of God an troublers of his
church. But bicause I perceiue the
houres to passe more swiftly then
they haue done at other tymes, I
mind to cōtract that which resteth
of this text into certayne points.
            The Prophet first fighteth against the present
desperation.Verse.19. &. 20. After be introduceth God
himselfe calling vpon his people. And last of
all he assureth his afflicted, that God will
come, and require accompt of all the bloude
thirstie tirants of the earth.
            First fighting against the present desperation,Verse. 19.
he sayth, thy dead shall liue, euen my
bodye (or with my body shall they arise,) awake
and sing ye that dwell in the dust. For
thy dew is as the dew of herbes.
            The Prophere here pierseth
throughe all impedimentes that
nature coulde obiect. And by the
victorie of faith, he ouercōmeth,
not onely the common enimies;

but the great and last enimie of al,
to wit, death it self. For this would
he say, Lorde I see nothing to thy
chosen, but miserie, to follow miserie,
and one affliction to succede
another, yea in the ende I see, that
death shal deuour thy dearest children.
But yet, O Lorde, I see thy
promise to be true, and thy loue to
remaine towards thy chosen, euen
when death appeareth to haue deuoured
them. For thy deade shall
liue, yea not onely shall they liue,
but my verie dead careasse shall arise.
And so I see honor and glory
to succede this temporall shame. I
see ioye permanent to come after
trouble, order to spring out of this
terrible confusion, and finallye, I
see that lyfe shal deuoure death, so
that death shall be destroyed, and
so thy seruauntes shall haue lyfe.
This I say is the victorie of faith,
when in the middest of deathe

throughout the light of Goddes
worde the afflicted see lyfe: Hipocrites
in the tyme of quietnesse &
prosperitie can generally confesse
that God is true in his promises,
but bring them to the extremitie,
and there ceasseth the hipocrite
further to trust in God than he seeth
naturall meanes whereby God
vseth to worke. But the true faithfull,
when all hope of naturall
meanes fayleth, then flye they to
God himselfe, and to the truth of
his promise, who is aboue nature,
yea whose workes are not so subiect
to the ordinarie course of nature,
that when nature fayloth, his
power and promise fayle also therwith.
            Let vs further observe that the
Prophete here speaketh not of all
deade in generall, but sayth, thy
dead O Lorde shall liue. In which
wordes he maketh difference betwixt

those that dye in the Lorde,
and those that dye in their naturall
corruption and in olde Adam. Die
in the Lord can none except those
that liue in him (I meane of those
that attaine to the yeares of discretion)
and none liue in him, except
those that with the Apostle can say
I liue, not I but Christ Iesus liueth
in me. The lyfe that now I liue, I
haue by the faith of the sonne of
God.Gala. 2. Not that I meane that the
faithfull haue at all houres suche
sense of the lyfe euerlasting; that
they feare not the deathe and the
troubles of this lyfe, no not so, for
the faith of all Goddes children is
weake, yea and in manye thinges
imperfect. But I meane, that such
as in death, and after death shall
liue, muste communicate in this
lyfe with Iesus Christ, and must be
regenerate by the sede of lyfe. That
is,1. Pet. 1. by the worde of the liuing and

euerlasting God, which whosoeuer
dispiseth, refuseth lyfe and ioye
euerlasting.
            The Prophet transferreth all the
promises of God to him selfe, saying,
Euen my dead body shal arise,
and imediately after, giueth commaundemēt
& charge to the dwellers
in the dust, that is, to the dead
carcasses of those that were departed
(for the spirit and soule of man
dwelleth not in the dust) that they
should awake, they should sing and
reioyce. For they should arise and
spring vp from the earth, euen as
the herbes doe, after they haue receyued
the dew from aboue.
            Tyme will not suffer that these
particulars be so largely intreated,
as they merit, & as I gladly would,
And therefore let vs first consider,
that the Prophet in trāsferring the
power and promise of God to him
self, doth not vendicate to himself,

any perticular prerogatiue aboue
the people of God, as that he alone
should liue and arise, and not they
also. But he doth it to let them vnderstande
that he taught a doctrine
whereof he was certayne, yea and
whereof they shoulde haue experience
after his death. As he should
say, my words appeare to you now
to be incredible, but the daye shall
come, that I shal be taken frō you,
my carcas shall be inclosed in the
bosome of the earth, and therfore
shall ye be ledde away captiues to
Babylon, where ye shall remayne
many dayes and yeares, as it were
buryed in your sepulchres.
            But then cal to minde that I sayd
vnto you before hand that my body
shall arise. Euen so shall ye rise
from your graues out of Babylon,
and be restored to your owne cuntry
and citie of Ierusalem. This I
doubt not, is the true meaning of

the Prophet. The charge that he giueth
to the dwellers in the dust, is
to expresse the power of Goddes
worde. Whereby, he not onely giueth
life where death appa
                  •
               antly
had preuayled, but also by it he
calleth things that are not, euen as
if they were. Ture it is that the
Prophete Isaiah sawe not the destruction
of Ierusalem, much lesse
could he se the restitutiō of it with
his corporall eyes, but he leaueth
this, as it were, in testament with
them, that when they were in the
extremitie of all bondage, they
should call to minde what the Prophet
of God had before spoken.
            And lest that his doctrine, and
this promise of God made vnto
them by his mouth, shoulde haue
bene forgottē (as we are euer prone
and ready to forget Gods promises
when we are pressed with anye
sorrow) God raysed vp vnto thē in

the midst of calamitie his Prophet
Ezechiell, vnto whome among
manye other visions he gaue this.
The hande of the Lorde first ledde
him in a place which was ful of dry
and dispersed bones.Ezech. 37. The question
was demaunded of the Prophet, if
these bones being wonderous dry
shuld lyue. The Prophet answered
                  •
               
the knowledge thereof appertained
vnto God. Charge was giuen vnto
him that he shoulde speake vnto
the dry bones, and saye, thus sayth
the Lorde God to these bones, beholde
I shall giue you breath, and
ye shall liue: I shall giue vnto you
sinewes, fleshe, and skinne, and ye
shall liue. And while the Prophete
spake (as he was commaunded) he
heard a voyce, and he sawe euery
bone ioyne in his marowe. He saw
them couered with flesh and skin,
albeit there was no spirit of lyfe in
them, he was commaunded againe

to speake and to say, thus sayth the
Lorde God, come O spirite from
the foure quarters, & blow in these
that are slayne that they may lyue.
And as he prophecied, the spirit of
lyfe came. They liued and stoode
vpon their feete. Nowe doth the
Lorde interprete what this vision
ment, saying, Sonne of man these
bones are the whole house of Israell.
Behold they say our bones are
dryed, our hope is perished, we are
playnely cut of, but beholde sayth
the Lord, I will open your graues,
I will bring you forth of them, ye
shall liue and come vnto the lande
of Israell, and ye shall knowe that
I am the Lorde.
            This vision I say, giuen to the
Prophete, and by the Prophete
preached to the people when they
thought that God had vtterly forgoten
them, compelled them more
diligently to aduert, what the former

Prophetes had spoken. It is
no doubt, but they caryed with
them both the prophecie of Isaiah
and Ieremie, so that the Prophete
Ezechiel is a commentarie to these
wordes of Isaiah, where he sayth,
thy dead O Lorde shall liue, with
my body they shall arise. The Prophet
bringeth in this similitude of
the deawe, to aunswere vnto that
part of their fidelitie, who can beleue
no further of Gods promises,
than they are able to apprehende
by naturall iudgemēt. As he wold
say, think ye this impossible, that
God shall giue lyfe vnto you and
bring you to an estate of a commō
wealth agayne, after that ye be
dead, and as it were rased from the
face of the earth. But why doe ye
not consider what God worketh
from yeare to yeare in the order of
nature, sometimes ye see the face
of the earth decked and beautified

with herbes, floures, grasse, and
fruites. Againe ye see the same vtterlye
taken awaye by stormes and
vehemencie of the winter. What
doth God to replenishe the earth
againe, and to restore the beauty
thereof. He sendeth downe his
small and soft dewe, the droppes
whereof in their descending, are
neyther great nor visible, and yet
thereby are the pores and secrete
vaynes of the earth, which before
by vehemencie of frost and colde
were shut vp, opened againe. And
so doth the earth produce againe
the like herbes, floures, and fruits.
Shal ye then thinke? that the dew
of Gods heauenly grace shall not
be as effectuall in you to whome he
hath made his promise, as that it is
in the herbes and fruites that from
yeare to yeare buddeth forth and
decayeth? if ye doe so the Prophet
would say your incredibility is inexcusable,

bicause ye doe neyther
rightlye waighe the power nor the
promise of your God.
            The like similitude vseth the Apostle
Paule against such as called
the resurrection in doubt, bicause
that by naturall iudgement they
coulde not apprehende that fleshe
once putryfied and resolued, as it
were in other substance shoulde arise
againe and retourne againe
to the same substance & nature.1. Corin. 16. O
fole (saith he) that which thou sowest
is not quickened, except it dy, &
that which thou sowest, thou sowest
not that body that shall be, but
bare corne, as it falleth, of wheate
or some other, but God giueth it
a body as it pleaseth him, euen to
euerye seede his owne bodye. In
which wordes and sentence, the
Apostle sharpelye rebuketh the
grosse ignorance of the Corinthians,
who began to call in doubt the

chiefe article of our faith, the resurrection
of the fleshe after that it
was once resolued, bicause that
naturall iudgement (as saide is) reclaymed
thereto. He reproueth (I
say) their grosse ignoraunce, bicause
that they might haue seene
and considered some proufe and
document thereof in the very order
of nature. For albeit the wheat
or other corne cast in the earth apeareth
to die, to putrifie, and so
to be lost, yet we see that it is not
perished, but that it fructifieth according
to Goddes will and ordinaunce.
            Now if the power of God be so
manifest in raysing vp of the fruits
of the earth, vnto the which no
particuler promise is made by god,
what shal be his power and vertue
in raysing vp of our bodyes, seeing
that thereto he is bound by the solempne
promise of Iesus Christ his

eternall wisdome, and the veritie
it selfe that can not lye, yea, seeing
that the members must once comm
                  •
               nicate
with the glorye of the
head, howe shall our bodyes which
are flesh of his flesh and bone of his
bones he stil for euer in corruptiō,Ephe. 5.
seeing that our head Iesus Christ is
now exalted in his glory. Noyther
yet is this power land good will of
God to be restrayned vnto the last
and generall resurrection onely,
but we ought to consider it in the
maruellous preseruation of his
church, and in the raysing vp of
the same from the very bottome of
death, when by titauntes it hath
bene oppressed from age to age.
            Nowe of the former wordes of
the Prophet we haue to gather this
comforte, that if at anye tyme we
shal see the face of the church with
in this realmeso defaced (as I think
it shall be soner than we looke for)

when we shall see, I say, vertue to
be dispised, vice to be mayntayned,
the veritie of God to be impugned,
lyes and mens inuentions,
holden in aucthoritie, and finally
when we shall see the true religion
of our God, and zelous obseruers
of the same, to be troden vnder the
feete of suche as in their heart saye
there is no God:Psal.14. Let vs then call to
minde what haue bene the wonderous
workes of our God from the
beginning, that it is his proper office
to bring forth lighte out of
darkenesse, order out of confusion,
lyfe out of death, & finally that it
is he, that calleth thigs that are not,
euen as if they were, as before we
haue hard. And if in the day of our
tēptation (which in my iudgemēt
approcheth fast) we be thus armed.
If our incredibilitie can not vtterly
be remoued, yet shal it so be corrected,
that dampnable desperation

oppresse vs not.
            
               But nowe let vs heare howe the
Prophete proceedeth, Come (sayth
he,) thou my people enter within thy chambers,
shut thy dore after thee, hide thy selfe a
very little while vntil the indingnation passe
ouer.
            Here the Prophet bringeth in God
amiably calling vpon his people to
come to himselfe, and to rest with
him vnto suche time as the furie &
sharpe plagues should be executed
vpon the wicked and inobedient.
It maye appeare at the first sight,
that all these words of the Prophet
in the person of God calling the
people vnto rest, are spoken in
vaine. For we neyther finde chambers
nor rest more prepared for the
dearest children of God (so farre as
mans iudgemēt can discerne) than
there was for the rebellious and inobedient.
For such as fel not in the
edge of the sworde, or dyed not of

pestilence, or by hunger, were eyther
caryed captiues into Babylō,
or else departed after into Egipt,
so that none of Abrahams feede,
had eyther chamber or quiet place
to remayne within the lande of
Canaan. For the resolution hereof
we must vnderstand that albert the
chambers whereunto God called
his chosen, be not visible. Yet notwithstanding
they are certaine, &
offer vnto Gods children quiet habitation
in spirite, howsoeuer the
flesh be trauayled and tormented.
            The chambers are then Goddes
sure promises, vnto the which gods
people is commaunded to resorte,
yea within the which they are cō
               inaunded
to close them selues in
the time of greatest aduersitie. The
maner of speaking is borowed frō
that iudgement & foresight, which
God hath printed in this our nature.
For whe! that men espie great

tempestes appearing to come, willingly,
they will not remayne vncouered
vpō the fields, but straight
way, they will drawe them to their
houses or holdes, that they maye
escape the vehemency of the same.
And if they feare any enimy to pursue
them, they wil shut their dores,
to the ende that sodainely the enimie
shall not haue entry. After
this same maner God speaketh to
his people, as he shoulde saye, the
tempest that shall come vpon this
whole nation shall be so terrible,
that nothing shall appeare but exterminatiō
to come vpō the whole
bodye. But thou my people, thou
I saye, that hearest my worde, beleuest
the same, and tremblest at
the threatenings of my Prophetes,
now when the world doth insolētly
resist, let such I say, enter within
the secrete chamber of my promises.
Let them conteyne themselues

quietly there, yea let them shut the
dore vpon them, and suffer not infidelitie,
the mortall enimie of my
truth and of my people that depend
therupon, to haue free entrie
to trouble (yea rather to murther)
my promise. And so shall they perceyue
that my indignation shall
passe, and that such as depend vpō
me, shall be saued.
            Thus we may perceyue the meaning
of the Prophete. Whereof we
haue first to obserue, that God acknowledgeth
them for his people,
that are in greatest affliction, yea
such as are reputed vnworthy of
mens presence, are yet admitted
with the secrete chamber of God.
Let no man thinke that fleshe and
bloude can sodaynely attayne to
that comfort, & therfore most expediēt
it is, that we be frequentlye
exercised in meditatiō of thesame.
Easie it is I graūt in time of prosperitie,

to saye and to thinke, that
God is our God, and that we are
his people. But when he hath giuē
vs ouer in the handes of oure enimies,
and tourned (as it were) his
back vnto vs, then I say, stil to reclayme him to be our God, and to
haue this assurance that we are his
people, procedeth wholly frō the
holy spirite of God,1. Iohn. 5. as is the greatest
victorie of faith, which ouercommeth
the worlde, for increase
whereof we ought continuallye to
pray.
            This doctrine we shall not think
straunge, if we shal cōsider how sodainely
our spirites are caryed away
from our God, and from beleuing
his promise, so sone as anye
great temptation doth apprehend
vs, then begin we to doubt if euer
we beleued Gods promises, if God
will fullfill them to vs, if we abide
in his fauour, if he regardeth and

loketh vpon the violence and iniurie
that is done vnto vs, and a
multitude of suche cogitations,
which before lurked quietlye in
our corrupted heartes, burst violently
forth when we are oppressed
with any desperate calamitie. Against
the which, this is the remedie,
once to apprehend and still to
retayne, God to be our God, and
firmelye to beleue, that we are his
people whome he loueth, and will
defende, not onely in affliction,
but euen in the middest of death it
selfe.
            Secondly let vs obserue, that the
iudgemēts of our God neuer were,
nor yet shall be so vehement vpon
the face of the earth, but that there
hath bene and shall be some secrete
habitation prepared in the sanctuary
of God for some of his chosen,
where they shall be preserued vntill
the indignation passe by, and

that God prepareth a tyme, that
they maye glorifie him againe before
the face of the worlde, that
sometimes despised them: and this
ought to be vnto vs no small comfort
in these appearing daungers,
to wit, that we be surely persuaded
that howe vehement that euer the
tēpest shal be, that it yet shall passe
ouer, and some of vs shall be preserued
to glorifie the name of oure
God as is aforesaide.
            Two vices lurke in this our nature,
the one is, that we can not
tremble at Gods threatninges before
that the plagues apprehende
vs, albeit that we see cause moste
iust why that his fierce wrath shuld
burne as a deuouring fire. The other
is, that when calamities before
pronounced fal vpon vs, then
begin we to sincke downe in desperation,
so that we neuer loke for
any comfortable end of the same.

To correct this our mortall infirmitie
in time of quietnesse, we
ought to consider what is the iustice
of our God, and howe odious
sinne is. And aboue all other, how
odyous Idolatry is in his presence
who hath forbidden it, and who
hath so seuerelye punished it in all
ages from the beginning. And in
the tyme of our afflictiō we ought
to consider, what haue beene the
wonderous workes of our God in
preseruation of his churche, when
it hath bene in vttermost extremitie.
For neuer shall we finde the
church humbled vnder the hands
of tirantes and cruellye tormented
by them, but therewith we shall
finde Goddes iuste vengeance to
fall vpon the cru
                  •

and his merciful deliuerance to be
shewed to the afflicted▪ And in taking
of this tryall, we shoulde not
onely cal to minde the histories of

auncient times, but also we should
diligentlye marke what notable
workes God hath wrought euen in
this our age, aswell vpon the one,
as vpon the other. We ought not
to thinke that oure God beareth
lesse loue to his church this daye,
than that he hath done from the
beginning. For as our God in his
owne nature is immutable, so remayneth
his loue towardes his elect,
alwaies vnchangeableEphe. 1. For as
in Christ Iesus he hath chosen his
Church before the beginning of al
ages, so by him will he mayntayne
& preserue the same vnto the end.
Yea, he will quiet the stormes, and
cause the earth to open her mouth
and receyue those raging flouds of
violent waters, caste out by the
Dragon, to drowne and cary away
the woman which is the spouse of
Iesus Christ, vnto whom,Apocal. 1

perpetuall protector.

(being exiled from Alexandria by
that blasphemous Apostata Iulian
the Emperor) sayd vnto his flock,
who bitterly wept for his enuious
banishment: Weepe not but be of
good comforte saide he, for this
little cloude wil sodainely vanish.
A little cloude he called both the
Emperor himselfe, and his cruell
tirannie. And albeit that small appearance
there was of any deliuerance
to the church of God, or yet
of any punishment to haue apprehended
the proude tirants, when
the man of god pronounced these
wordes, yet shortely after, God did
giue witnesse that those words did
not procede from flesh nor bloud,
but from Gods verie spirite. For
not long after, being in warfarre,
he receyued a deadly wound, whether

by his owne hande or by one
of his owne souldiers, the writers
clearely conclude not, but casting
his owne bloud against the heauē,
he sayde, Vicisti tandem Galilee, That
is, at last thou hast ouercome thou
Galilean, so in despite he termed
the Lorde Iesus, and so perished
that tiraunt in his owne iniquitie,
the storme ceassed and the church
of God rceyued now comfort.
            Such shall be the ende of all cruell
persecuters, their raigne shal be
short their ende miserable, & their
name shall be left in execratoni to
Goddes people. And yet shall the
Church of God remayne to Gods
glory after all stormes.
            But nowe shortely let vs come to the laste
point. For behold saith the Prophet,Verse. 2
                     •
                  
                the Lord
wil come out of his place to visite the iniquitie
of the inhabitants of the earth vpō them.
And the earth shall disclose her bloude and

shall no more hide her stayne, bicause that
the finall ende of the troubles of Goddes chosen,
shall not be before that the Lorde Iesus
shall retourne to restore al things to their ful
perfection.
            The Prophet bringeth forth the
eternall God, as it were from his
owne place and habitation, and
therewith sheweth the cause of his
comming to be, that he may take
accōpt of al such as haue wrought
wickedlye, for that he meaneth,
where that he sayth: He will visite
the iniquitie of the inhabitants of
the earth vpon them. And lest that
any shoulde think that the wrong
doers are so manye that they can
not be called vnto accompt, he giueth
vnto the earth as it were an
office and charge to beare witnesse
against al those that haue wrought
wickedly, and chiefly, against those
that haue shed innocent bloud frō
the beginning. And saith, that

the earth shall disclose her bloude,
and shall no more hide her slayne
men.
            Yf the tirants of the earth & such
as delight in shedding of bloude
should be persuaded that this sentence
is true, they shoulde not so
furiouslye come to their owne destruction.
For what man can be so
enraged, that he woulde willingly
doe euen before the eyes of God,
that which might prouoke his maiestie
to anger. Yea prouoke him to
becōe his enimy for euer, if that he
vnderstode how fearful a thing it is
to fall into the hands of the liuing
God. The cause then of this blind
furie of the world, is the ignorance
of God, and that men thinke that
God is but an Idoll, and that there
is no knowledge aboue, that beholdeth
their tirannie, neither yet
iustice that will, nor power that
maye represse their impietie. But

yet the spirite of truth doth witnesse,
the contrary, affirming, that
as the eyes of the Lorde are vpon
the iust,
                  
                     ••
                  al. and as his eares are ready
to receiue their sobbing & prayers,
so is his angry visage against such,
as worke iniquitie. He hateth and
holdeth in abhomination euerye
disceitful and bloud thirstie man.
Whereof he hath giuen sufficient
document from age to age in preseruing
the one, or at the lest in reuenging
of their cause, and in punishing
of the other. Where it is
sayde that the Lorde will come frō
his place, and that he wil visite the
iniquitie of the inhabitants of the
earth vppon them, and that the
earth shall disclose her bloude.
            We haue to consider what moste
commonly hath beene, and what
shal be the condition of the church
of God, to wit, that it is not onelye
hated, mocked, and dispised,

but that it is exposed, as it were in
a pray, vnto the furie of the wicked,
so that the bloud of the children
of God,Psal. is spilt like water vpon
the face of the earth. The vnderstanding
whereof, albeit it be
vnpleasaunt to the flesh. Yet to vs
it is most profitable, least that we,
seing the cruel entreatings of Gods
seruauntes, beginne to misknowe
the spouse of Iesus Christ, bicause
that she is not intreated in this vnthankfull
worlde, as that the iust
and vpright dealing of Gods children
doth deserue. But contrarywise,
for mercy, they receyue crueltie,
for doing good to manye, of
al the reprobate they receyue euil.
And this is decreed in Gods eternal
councell, that the members maye
follow the trace of the head, to the
ende, that God in his iust iudgements,
should finally condempne
the wicked. For howe shoulde he

punish the inhabitāts of the earth,
if their iniquitie deserued it not▪
How should the earth disclose our
bloude, if it should not be vniustly
spilt? We must then commit our
selues into the handes of our God,
and laye downe our neckes, yea &
pacientlye suffer our bloude to be
shed, that the righteous iudge may
require accompt, as most assuredly
he shall of all the bloude that hath
bene shed, from the bloud of Abell
the iust, till the day that the earth
shall disclose the same.A terrible, but moste true sentēce. I say euery
one that sheddeth or consenteth to
shed the bloude of Gods children,
shal be giltie of the whole. So that
all the bloude of Goddes children
shall crye vengeance, not onely in
general, but also in particuler, vpon
euerye one, that hath shed the
bloude of anye that vniustly suffered.
            And if any thinke it strange that

such as liue this daye, can be giltie
of the bloude that was shed in the
dayes of the Apostles. Let them cō
               sider
that the veritie it selfe pronounced,
that all the bloude that
was shedde from the dayes of Abel
vnto the dayes of Zacharie should
come vpon that vnthankefull generation,
that heard his doctrine,
and refused it. The reason is euident,
for as there is two heads and
and captaines that rule vpon the
whole worlde, to wit, Iesus Christ,
the Prince of iustice and peace, &
Sathan, called the Prince of the
worlde, so are they but two armies,
that hath continued battaile from
the beginning, and shall fight vnto
the ende. The quarell is one
which the armie of Iesus Christ
susteine, which the reprobate doe
persecute, to wit, the eternal truth
of the eternall God, and the image
of Iesus Christ, printed in his elect,

so that whosoeuer in any age persecuteth
any one member of Iesus
Christ for his truth sake, subscribeth
as it were with his hande, the
persecution of all that haue passed
before him. And this ought the tirantes
of this age deepely to consider,
for they shal be giltye not only
of the bloud shed by themselues,
but of al (as saide is) that hath bene
shed for the cause of Iesus Christ
from the beginning of the worlde.
            Let the faithfull not be discouraged
although they be appointed
as shepe to the slaughter house, for
he, for whose sake they suffer, shal
not forget to reuenge their cause.
I am not ignoraunt that fleshe and
bloude will thinke that kinde of
suporte, too too late. For we had
rather be preserued stil aliue, than
to haue our bloud to be reuenged
after our death. And truely if our
felicitie stoode in this lyfe, or if

death temporall should bring vnto
vs anye damage, our desire in
that behalfe were not to be dampned.
But seeing that death is common
to al, and that this temporall
lyfe, is nothing but miserie, & that
death doth fully ioyne vs with our
God, and giueth vnto vs the possession
of our inheritaunce, why
shuld we think it straunge to leaue
this worlde and goe to our head &
soueraigne captayne Iesus Christ?
            Now last we haue to obserue this
maner of speaking, where that the
Prophet sayth. The earth shall disclose
her bloud. In which wordes,
the Prophet would accuse the crueltie
of those that dare so vnmercifully
ryue from the breastes of the
earth, the dearest children of God,
and cruelly cut their throts in her
bosome, who is by God appointed
the common mother of mankinde,
so that she vnwillingly is compelled

led to open her mouth, & receyue
their bloud.
            If such tirannie were vsed against
any naturall woman, as violently
to pull her infant frō her breastes,
cut the throte of it in her own bosome,
and compell here to receyue
the bloude of her deare childe in
her owne mouth, al nations would
holde the fact so abhominable,
that the like had neuer beene done
in the course of nature. And no
lesse wickednesse cōmit they that
shedde the bloud of Gods children
vpon the face (as I haue saide) of
their common mother the earth.
But be of good courage (O little &
dispised flocke of Christ Iesus) for
he that seeth your griefe hath power
to reuenge it. He that will not
suffer one teare of yours to fal, but
that shall be kept and reserued in
his bottle, till the fulnesse thereof
be poured downe from heauen vpon

th

               se that caused you to weepe
and mourne, this your mercifull
God (I saye) will not suffer your
bloud for euer to be couered with
the earth, naye the flaming fiers
that haue licked vp the bloude of
any of our brethren, the earth that
hath beene defiled with it, I saye
with the bloude of Gods children,
for otherwise, to shed the bloud of
the cruel bloudshedders, is to purge
the land from bloud, and as it were
to sanctifie it. The earth (I say) shal
purge her selfe of it and shew it before
the face of god, yea the beasts,
foules, and other creatures whatsoeuer
shall be compelled to render
that which iniustly they haue receyued,
be it flesh, bloude, or bones

O Lorde, which altogether thou
shalt glorifie, according to thy promise
made to vs in Iesus Christ thy
sonne, to whom with thee and the

holy Ghost be honor, praise, and
glory, for euer and euer. Amen.
            Let vs now humble our selues in
the presence of our God, and from
the bottome of oure heartes, let vs
desire him to assist vs with the power
of his holy spirite, that albeit
for our former negligences, God
giue vs ouer in the handes of other
than suche as rule in his feare, that
yet he let vs not forget his mercy,
and that glorious name, that hath
bene proclaymed amongst vs: but
that we may loke throughout the
dolorous storme of his present displeasure,
and see aswell what punishment
he hath appointed for
the cruell tirants, as what rewarde
he hath layde in store for such as
continue in his feare, to the ende:
that it would further please him to
assist, that albeit we see his Church
so diminished, that it shal appeare
to be brought, as it were, to vtter

extermination, that yet we maye
be assured, that in our God, there
is power and will, to increase the
number of his chosen, euen while
they be inlarged, to the vttermost
coastes of the earth. Giue vs O
Lorde, hearts to visite thee in time
of our affliction. And that albeit
we see none ende of our dolors,
that yet our faith and hope maye
conduct vs to the assured hope of
that ioyfull resurrection. In the
which, we shal possesse the fruite of
that, for the which nowe we trauaile.
And in the meane season,
graunt vnto vs O Lorde, to repose
our selues in the sanctuary of thy
promise, that in thee, we may finde
comforte, till that this thy great
indignation (begonne amongst vs)
may passe ouer, and thou thy selfe,
appeare to the comfort of thy afflicted,
and to the terrour of thine
enimies. Let vs pray with heart &

complayntes
of all Ministers in
generall, and of
some nowe more
to be lamented in
others in particuler,
being considered in this oure

last assembly (beloued in the Lord
Iesus) diuers men were of diuers
iudgementes, howe the griefe and
pouertie of such as faithfully trauayle
in their vocation within the
Church of God, might somewhat
be relieued. After long reasoning
it was concluded, that a supplication
shuld be direct to the Quenes
Maiestie,The an

                  hing. requiring that respecte
might be had to the extreme necessity
of our Ministers. But bicause
that the necessity of our brethren
is great, and their pouertie present,
and that the remedie can not be
sodaine nor yet certaine, it was
thought expedient, that a generall
admonition should be made to all
the faithful, to haue respect to the
necessitie of the Ministers vniuersally.
But especially, that the faithfull
in euery parish haue consideration
to the necessitie of suche as
trauaile amongst them in true doctrine

& holsome exhortatiō,This is the commaundement of the spirit o
                     •
                   God. Hebr. 13. which
admonition, whosoeuer dispiseth,
dispiseth no doubt, the chiefe dutie
of a christian. For alas with
what conscience can we eate oure
owne bread, and know the bowels
of such as offers to vs the breade of
lyfe, and minister to vs spirituall
things, to craue of God and vs but
a reasonable sustentation, and yet
can not finde suche fauour at oure
handes, as Turkes finde amongest
Turkes, and Iewes amongest that
blinded nation.
            Alas where are the bowels of mercy
that sometyme were founde amongst
the faithfull? How farre is
this our filthye auariounesse, distant
from that liberalitie which
appeared in the primitiue Church,
when that the faithfull cast their
substance at the feete of the Apostles?Act. 2.
Where is that charitie whichRom 15.
moued the Churches of Macedonia2 Corint. 9.

and to send the same to relieue the
indigence of the pore at Ierusalem,

that was in the Galathians & Philippians,Galat. 4.
of whome the one would
haue giuē their eyes to the Apostle
Paule,Phil. 4. if that might haue supported
him, the other spared not
to sende to their preacher being
prisoner in Rome, their supporte
and comfort most liberally. If we
thinke to be partakers with suche
men in glorye, why studye we not
to followe their vertues? If this be
the same Euangel of saluation, (as
no doubt it is, that the Apostles
preached, that now of Gods great
mercy, is preached to vs, alas why
brings it not forth some part of the
former fruites,Let euerie mā descend within him selfe. if we thinke they
are but men and not Apostles, that
nowe preach vnto vs, let vs consider

that the Apostles were men,
and receyued of men support and
comforte, and also that others than
the Apostles were grounded for by
the liberalitie of the faithfull,Act. 6. as in
the Actes of the Apostles maye be
seene.
            We haue not Paule to write vnto
vs newe Epistles, neyther yet Mathewe,
Marke, Lucas, or Iohn to
dite vnto vs a newe Euangell, bicause
things written are sufficient
if we vnderstande and followe the
same: but of Gods great mercy we
haue men that open and explane
vnto vs not onely writings of the
new, but also of the old testament.
We haue the seruaunts of God indued
with rare and notable graces,
whom if we contempne, it is to be
feared that God shall so punish our
ingratitude, that he shal take from
vs the light of his worde, and the
true messengers of the same, and

suffer darkenesse agayne to apprehende

and yet we shut vp the bowels of

            Let vs consider deare brethren
how carefully God commaundeth
in his law that the Leuites & such
as serued that material tabernacle,
should be prouided of sufficient liuings,
yea let vs cōsider with what
plagues God punished Israell and

Iuda when his statutes and his seruaunts
were dispised.Leuit. 27. Shal we think
that the eternall God wil spare vs,Nu. 28.
if we be found contemners of such
as truely preache the Lorde Iesus,Deut. 12.
or lawfully beare any charge within
his Church, we maye be assured
that he will not. For as the bodye
is more excellent, than is the shadow,
and as the veritie is to be preferred
to the signe, so are the Ministers
of the new testament & their
spirituall seruice, to be preferred
tu the leuites, and their carnall ceremonies,
the contempt whereof,
can not but craue at Gods handes
moste seuere punishment, bicause
(as sayde is) the office of the one
doth farre excell the office of the
other. They did but reade the law,
kill the sacrifice, sley the beastes,
take of the skinnes, wash the flesh,
and offer the same as was cōmaunded
in the law, and for such seruice

were the tenthes first fruites, and
other dueties appointed for their
sustentation: but the Ministers of
Iesu Christ haue an office without
al comparison more excellent, for
they bring to vs the glad tidinges
of saluation, by the two edged
sworde of Goddes worde, which is
mighty in operatiō, they sley that
old man that neuer fightes against
God, they make his thought patent
to his owne confusion, that
the newe man of God maye take
lyfe.Hebr. 4. They wash the soules with theRom. 8.
bloude of Iesus Christe which aboundantly
drops from their lips,As Christ was crucified amongest the Galathians.

and effect of the death of Iesus
Christ,Gala. 3. and rightly minister his sacramentes
lefte to be vsed in his
Church,Rom. 12. to holde vs in recent memorie
of that so great a benefite.
            Finallye by them are we taught
and conducted, to offer not onely

prayers and thanks giuing: but also
our bodies and soules in a reasonable
and liuely sacrifice vnto
God by Iesus Christ. And yet (O
cruell ingratitude) shal we care no
more for their sustentation, than
that we were nothing addicted vnto
them, neyther yet that God had
raised them vppe after ouer long
blindnesse, to reduce vs againe to
the right way of saluation, and to
conduct vs in the same to the end.
            If we thinke that al these things
may be due without ministers or
without preaching, we vtterly deceyue
our selues. For the same order
that God hath obserued since
that he hath collected his visible
church, he will shall be obserued
so long as it continueth vpon the

if we thinke that our children can

that ministers are not necessarie,
and so are we nothing addicted
vnto them. But if that faith commeth
by hearing,Rom. 10. and that by the
hearing of Gods worde, and that

Gods word is not sent vnto vs absolutely
from heauen by Aungels,
but is planted by the holy spirite
in the heartes and mouthes of men
whome God of his mercye sendes
forth into the world, to sowe therin
the seede of his Euangell, we
can not but cōfesse our selues detters
to our ministers. The dispisers
of whome, yea all suche as to their
power supporte them not in their
necessities, are before his throne
iudged contempners of his owne
maiestie. And therfore yet once againe,
let euery faithfull consider
what is his duetie, and let vs abhor
that ingratitude that we shuld suffer
the seruants of the Lorde Iesus
to begge, or trauaile in pouerty before
our eyes, for if we doe, we banishe
from vs Iesus Christ and the
light of his euangell. The Apostle
commaundeth a bishop, and euery
true preacher of Iesus Christ is a

christian bishop among the rest of
his vertues to be one that keepeth
hospitalitie, and is able to receyue
straungers. This can he not doe
without reasonable prouision, and
by whome the bishop shoulde be
prouided, S. Paule aunswereth in
these wordes.Gala. 6. Let him that is
taught cōmunicate in al his goods,
with him that teacheth him, and
againe, is it anye great thing, that
while we sowe vnto you spirituall
things, that we shuld reape of you
carnall things? of which and many
moe places it is euident, that
the flock is boundē to prouide for
their pastor.
            I wil not excuse vs deare brethrē
to cry and complaine, we are compelled
to answere our bishops, persons,
and vicars. Our teachers are
taken vp most rigorously, how shal
we then be able to susteyne oure
ministers. These complaintes and

appearing reasons deare brethren,
will vanish with winde, when we
shal come to the straight examination
of cōsciences before God.Pro. 3. For
are we not commaunded to honor
God with our substance? & thinke
we that we doe honor him when
with our substāce we fil the bellies
of dumb dogges, yea of Gods coniured
enimies, and suffer his seruauntes
to fall into pouertie, before
our eyes, if ye thinke we shall
be excused bicause that the order
of lawe constrayneth vs therevnto,
the Godly feare in case this reason
shall be admitted before God, lest
tirannie vnder collour of lawe, wil
take from vs our tithes, and so can
we not sustayne our ministers. This
reason brethren will be weake, yea
so weake, that we feare it shal be repelled
before the incorrupt iudge.
For howe manye of vs haue complayned
vpon that tiraunt? Who

hath made intercessiō to the Maiestrats
for redresse of that enormity.
Yea alas, howe many of vs are not
maintayners of those theues, and
partakers of their murders, called
Bishops, Abbottes, and Pryors. Let
no man wōder that we terme such
men with so odious termes, no, let
them rather wonder, that God
poureth not forth the vttermost of
his vengeaunce vpon the realme,
and vs that maintaine such tirants
in their tirannie, in this great light
of his Euangell. Theues they are,
for they take large fee and serues
not, murtherers they are, bicause
that by withholding the bread of
lyfe, they cause the soules of men
to dye, for hunger of Gods worde.
And yet how conspire we with thē,
what doe we to maintayne that abuse:
of those theues,Or Leases. we haue tacks
by them, we haue interest and title
to tithes, and for loue of the spoile,

we mainetaine their murthers in
oppression of the pore. Let vs not
be deceyued deare brethren.Howsoeuer▪ the worlde mocke this God shall aproue it. There
is no lawe made by man, that can
make these lawful, neyther yet the
substance of one to be the iust possession
of an other, without a iust
title.
            The tenthes were once appointed
by God to the Leuites, to the
pore, to the widow, fatherlesse, and
straungers, and the lawes of Emperours,
Kings and Princes, did after
Christ, appoint the same to the
like vse, to wit, to the sustentation
of such, as trauaile in the Church,
for the reliefe of the pore, and for
maintenaunce of learning. Nowe
say we, to transfer the tythes from
these vses, the persons before named
not being prouided for, is
both to commit theft & sacriledge,
yea, the spoile of the pore is in the
houses of so manye, as vniustlye

possesse them, and who they are ye
haue before heard, neyther shall
they in the ende escape that sentence
of the Prophete.Zacha. 5. The malediction
of the Lorde is vpon the
house of the thefe. But yet brethrē,
let vs suppose that in no sorte we
did consent with those oppressiōs,
but that we opponed our selues vnto
them to the vttermoste of our
powers, and yet we were oppressed
in our iust cause by the tirannie of
vniust lawes? should we yet be excused
before God if we communicate
not with the necessitie of the
ministers of Iesus Christ? Let vs
be moste assured that we can not,
for that sentence of our Lorde and
iudge standes euer in force.

neyther doth extremitie of lawes,
nor corruption of tymes excuse
vs before God, of the duetie he requires

Prophets of the Lorde, and fed thē
with bread and water, that is, liberallye,
and sufficientlye, for then
was water more scant in Israel than
ale or wyne is (as yet) amongest vs.
Did a man feede an hundered seruauntes
of the Lorde, and in that
tyme when things were most scant,
and yet both the King and the
Queene sought the subuersion of
true religion, and the destruction
of all Gods true seruants, and shal
not a thousand of vs and moe that

haue professed the Lord Iesus with
in this realme, vpon our charges,
sustaine two or three hundereth of
such as haue trauailed, and yet trauaile
to aduance the kingdome of
Iesus Christ amongst vs? if we doe
not, fearefull shall the sentence be,
that shall be pronounced against
vs, by him, whose voyce we shall
not then be able to gainstand, whē
from his throne he shall saye.Math. 25. Depart
from me ye workers of iniquitie,
for I was hungry and ye fed me
not, thirstie ye gaue me no drinke,
naked ye clothed me not, I lacked
harbrowe, and ye receyued me not
into your house.
            Playne it is that Christ Iesus in
his owne person neyther suffers
hunger nor thrist, he needes neyther
clothes nor house, but as him
selfe in the same place saith, whatsoeuer
ye did not to the lest one of
these, that ye did not to me. Let

vs deare brethren ponder these
wordes, and let vs nowe beginne to
shew the fruites of repentance, and
vnfaynedly to magnifie the worde
of our saluation. Let the bowels
of our mercye be opened to oure
brethren. Let neuer the pestilente
Papists haue cause to reioyce ouer
vs, that they shall hereafter saye,
that our own ingardenes banished
Iesus Christ from vs. Which thing
if without hipocrisie and of good
courage we begin to doe, then no
doubt but God shall blesse the labors
of our hande, he shall restore
to vs our former courage, & strike
the hartes of our enimies with the
same feare, that they haue felt before.

            O Lorde for thine owne name
