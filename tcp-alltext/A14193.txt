            But som mirth with modestie wil be glad to vse
            As we in thys Enterlude shall now vnfolde,
            Wherin all scuri

               itie we vtterly refuse,
            Auoiding such mirth wherin is abuse:
            Knowing nothing more comēdable for a mās recreation
            Than Mirth which is vsed in an honest fashion:
            For Myrth prolongeth lyfe, and causeth health.
            Mirth recreates our spirites and voydeth pensiuenesse,
            Mirth increaseth amitie, not hindring our wealth,
            Mirth is to be vsed both of more and lesse,
            Being mixed with vertue in decent comly

            As we trust no good nature can gainsay the

            Which mirth we intende to vse, auoidyng all blame.
            The wyse Poets long time heretofore,
            Under merrie Comedies secretes did declare,
            Wherein was contained very vertuous

               ore,
            With mysteries and forewarnings very rare.
            Suche to write neither Plautus nor Terence dyd spare,
            Whiche among the learned at this day beares the bell:
            These with such other therein dyd excell.
            Our Comedie or Enterlude which we intende to play.
            Is named Royster Doyster in déede.
            Which against the vayne glorious doth inuey,
            Whose humour the roysting sort continually doth féede.
            Thus by your pacience we intende to procéede
            In this our Enterlude by Gods leaue and grace,
            And here I take my leaue for a certaine space.

                     AS long lyueth the mery man (they say)
                  As doth the sory man, and longer by a day.
                  Yet the Grassehopper for all his Sōmer pipyng,
                  Sterueth in Winter wyth hungrie gripyng,
                  Therefore an other sayd sawe doth men aduise,
                  That they be together both mery and wise.
                  Thys Lesson must I practise, or else ere long,
                  Wyth mée Mathew Merygréeke it will be wrong.
                  In deede men so call me, for by him that vs bought,
                  What euer chaunce betide, I can take no thought,
                  Yet wisedome woulde that I did my selfe bethinke
                  Where to be prouided this day of meate and drinke:
                  For knowe ye, that for all this merie note of mine,
                  He might appose me now that should aske where I dine.
                  My lyuing lieth heere and there, of Gods grace,
                  Sometime wyth this good man, sometyme in that place,
                  Sometime Lewis Loytrer biddeth me come néere,
                  Somewhyles Watkin Waster maketh vs good chéere,
                  Sometime Dauy Diceplayer when he hath well cast
                  Kéepeth reuell route as long as it will last.
                  Sometime Tom Titiuile maketh vs a feast,
                  Sometime with sir Hugh Pye I am a bidden gueast,
                  Sometime at Nichol Neuerthriues I get a soppe,
                  Sometime I am feasted with Bryan Blinkinsoppe,
                  Sometime I hang on Hankyn Hoddydodies sléeue,
                  But thys day on Ralph Royster Doysters by hys léeue.
                  For truely of all men he is my chiefe banker
                  Both for meate and money, and my chiefe shootanker.
                  For, sooth Roister Doister in that he doth say,
                  And require what ye will ye shall haue no nay,
                  
                     
But now of Roister Doister somewhat to expresse,
                  That ye may estéeme him after hys worthinesse,
                  In these twentie townes and seke them throughout,
                  Is not the like stocke, whereon to graffe a loute.
                  All the day long is he facing and craking
                  Of his great actes in fighting and fraymaking:
                  But when Roister Doister is put to his proofe,
                  To kéepe the Quéenes peace is more for his behoofe.
                  If any woman smyle or cast on hym an eye,
                  Up is he to the harde eares in loue by and by,
                  And in all the hotte haste must she be hys wife,
                  Else farewell hys good days, and farewell his life,

                     aufe Royster Doister is but dead and gon
                  Excepte she on hym take some compassion,
                  Then chiefe of counsell, must be Mathew Merygréeke,
                  What if I for mariage to suche an one séeke?
                  Then must I sooth it, what euer it is:
                  For what he sayth or doth can not be amisse,
                  Holde vp his yea and nay, be his nowne white sonne,
                  Prayse and rouse him well, and ye haue his heart wonne,
                  For so well liketh he his owne fonde fashions
                  That he taketh pride of false commendations.
                  But such sporte haue I with him as I would not léese,
                  Though I should be bounde to lyue with bread and chéese.
                  For e
                        •
                     alt hym, and haue hym as ye lust in déede:
                  Yea to hold his finger in a hole for a néede.
                  I can with a worde make him fayne or loth,
                  I can with as much make him pleased or wroth,
                  I can when I will make him mery and glad,
                  I can when me lust make him sory and sad,
                  I can set him in hope and eke in dispaire,
                  I can make him speake rough, and make him speake fair
                        •
                     .
                  But I maruell I see hym not all thys same day,
                  I wyll séeke him out: But loe he commeth thys way,
                  
                     
I haue yond espied hym sadly comming,

                  Why did God make me suche a goodly person?

                  And where is my trustie friende Mathew Merygréeke?

                  I wyll make as I sawe him not, he doth me seeke.

                  I wyll not heare him, but make as I had haste,
                  Farewell all my good friendes, the tyme away dothe waste,

                  So loe, that is a breast to blowe out a candle.
                  But what is this great matter I woulde faine knowe,
                  We shall fynde remedie therefore I trowe.

                  But to breake out at all times ye would be bolde.
                  What is it? hath any man threatned you to beate?

                  What is he that durst haue put me in that heate?
                  He that beateth me by his armes shall well fynde,
                  That I will not be farre from him nor runne behinde.

                  But bicause ye were refused the last day,
                  Ye sayd ye woulde nere more be intangled that way.
                  I woulde medle no more, since I fynde all so vnkinde.

                  But is your loue tell me first, in any wise,
                  In the way of Mariage, or of Merchandise?
                  If it may otherwise than lawfull be founde,
                  Ye get none of my helpe for an hundred pounde.

                  To speake with Custance your selfe shoulde be very well,
                  What good therof may come, nor I, nor you can tell.
                  But now the matter standeth vpon your mariage,
                  Ye must now take vnto you a lustie courage.
                  Ye may not speake with a faint heart to Custance,
                  But with a lusty breast and countenance,
                  That she may knowe she hath to answere to a man.

                  Let vs sée how to behaue your selfe ye can doe.
                  Ye must haue a portely bragge after your estate.

                  To be taken for a woman enclined to vice.
                  Nothing at all to Uertue gyuing hir due price.

                  Ye shall in no wyse lyue at your owne libertie,
                  Doe and say what ye lust, ye shall neuer please me,
                  But when ye are mery, I will be all sadde,
                  When ye are sory, I will be very gladde.
                  When ye séeke your heartes ease, I will be vnkinde,
                  At no tyme, in me shall ye muche gentlenesse finde.
                  But all things contrary to your will and minde,
                  Shall be done: otherwise I wyll not be behinde
                  To speake. And as for all them that woulde do you wrong
                  I will so helpe and mainteyne, ye shall not lyue long.
                  Nor any foolishe dolte, shall cumbre you but I.

                  Then was the fault in readyng, and not in writyng,
