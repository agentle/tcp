               RIght worſhipfull: as I was in the time of your worſhipfull father, for many great fauours bounden. ſo haue I euer deuoted my ſelfe and all my abilitie, to your worſhip, and all the reſt of his worſhipfull progenie.

            The royall, rare, and moſt honorable intertainment of the famous King, Chriſtierne the 4. King of Denmarke &c. ſince his firſt arriuall on ſhore, the 17. day of Iuly 1606.
            
               WHen it pleaſed GOD, to place the Imperiall crown of this moſt bleſſed, and famous kingdome, on the head of our moſt glorious and renowned ſoueraigne King Iames, it was not a little admired amongſt the commons of this land, the honors done his highneſſe, by moſt Chriſtian Kings, and Princes, who by their Ambaſſadours, as from France, Spaine, Italy, Denmarke, Holland, and others, not onely preſented their honourable loues, and ioy for his happineſſe therein, but deſiring peace with his people and ſtate, with loue in all honour to be continued amongſt them and their nations.
            Their honourable and Chriſtian requeſt, his Highneſſe with all honor embraced, with ſuch kingly conditions, loue, and fame, to him and his ſubiects, as all the Kings and Potentates of the

world may admire, and his owne people ioy in ſuch honoured peace.
            For thereby haue our Marchants ſure and ſafe trafficke to all nations, and they to our land, where they trade at their pleaſures.
            Since when, diuers nations, which with good regard of thoſe bleſſings, God hath endued this Realme withall, and the troubles of their owne countries, preferring their quiet, aboue their natiue countrey, wealth, and friends, haue left their home-borne regions, and placed themſelues hero with their families: where they liue free from thoſe dangers they were ſubiect vnto, vnder the gouernment of a moſt religious and honourable King, inioying their wealth without feare, and reſting in all tranquillitie of minde, and ſecuritie of their eſtates, praiſe God for his excellent Maieſtie, that ſo carefully tendereth their liues and ſafeties, as his owne peoples.
            Peace and all happy tranquilitie, with ſo many countries being eſtabliſhed, and his Maieſtie enioying the bleſſing of the moſt high God that placed him, Ambaſſadours from ſtate to ſtate, oftentimes paſſed, whereby the Kings from farre, receiued ioyfull tidings of his royall gouernement, health, and welfare, and his Maieſtie likewiſe, from them and their kingdomes. The affinitie of bloud, and deſire of true brotherly loue to be continued; which Loue is the true Loadeſtone that draweth friends, and moueth the heart

to deſire the company, which they moſt honour and eſteeme oft, as we haue read many famous examples of all eſtates, aſwell Princes, as others.
            But in mans memory hath not beene heard, (nor hearing) with more reioycing ſeene, ſo 
                  •
               are and moſt excellent a ſimpathie of true and honorable loue, as is moſt apparent, by that moſt royall King Chriſtian of Denmarke: who nothing regarding the dangers of the ſeas, nor any other accidents, albeit he did often times heare of the gracious and happy eſtates of our dread ſoueraigne King Iames, his Royall and moſt eſteemed Princely ſiſter Queene Annc, Prince Henry and their royall iſſue, that ſuch is his great deſire and Kingly affection, that no report what ſo euer could ſatiſfie his Kingly minde, but in perſon aduentured, to be partaker of their moſt royall preſence, and to participate with them and their maieſt call companies, wherein no doubt a moſt honourable and true combined royall minde is expreſſed.
            For which honourable intention, his ſhips of great ſtrength were prepared, & 2. Pinnaſes: the Admirall wherein his owne perſon came, being a moſt huge ſhip, is eſteemed of 1500. Tunnes: which ſhip is ſo adorned with rich gold and very excellent workemanſhip, as many thouſands vpon report ther

            The Kingly attendants of his perſon, and all others of his traine, furniſhed in apparell very riche and moſt beautifull, euery one in his eſtate and place: his Counſell and chiefe men, very decent after their countrey faſhion, richly decked in ſilke with gold and ſiluer lace, Iewels and chaines of rare eſtimation.
            His Pages, and garde of his perſon, in Blew Veluet laide with Siluer Lace, for their beſt ſute, and one ſute for to exchange of other ſilke: whitiſh coloured Hattes, with bands embrodered: moſt of them, either white or blew ſtockins: his Trumpetors in white Satten Dublets, Blew Veluet hoſe trimd with ſilke and ſiluer lace, watched cloakes guarded with ſundry colours, & white Hattes with Blew ſilke and golde bands embrodered: his common garde of Souldiers, with Muskets furniſhed, very riche: white Fuſtian dublets, watched hoaſe with white and Blew Lace, looſe Caſſockes large and faire, like our foot-mens coates, with white and Blew lace, Hattes with bands ſuted like: and all his common ſouldiers, in caſſocks and hoaſe of watched colour: the maiſter and his mates, Gunners and chiefe officers, being very riche in their apparell, his Trunckes and other prouiſion for carriage,

            For the gouernment of his followers of all ſorts, according to his Kingly pleaſure, he ordained a Marſhall, who had vnder Marſhals many, with great charge from his Maieſtie, that if any man of his company ſhould be drunke, or otherwiſe to abuſe himſelfe in any maner towards Engliſhmen, or his owne followers, to be puniſhed ſharply. ſuch is the royall care and honor of his excellencie, which is duely executed.
            All things being ready for the voyage, which with great care of all his officers was accompliſht, after a moſt honourable order taken for gouernment of the Kingdome in his abſence, the winde ſeruing fitly, and a heauie parting of the Queene his honoured and moſt gracious Mother, with the States and chiefe of the land, with teares of ſorrow plentifully ſhed of his louing ſubiects, and their hearty prayers zealouſlie made to GOD, for the proſperous ſucceſſe of his Maieſtie at Sea, and happy arriuall to his deſirous Porte, he bad them all farewell, leauing them to their charge, and betooke his royall perſon to the mercy of GOD, that guideth heauen, and earth, and ſeas, and in all dangers protecteth his people.

When they came ſayte with the townes end at Graueſend, they from the ſhippes diſcried the barges, and gaue notice there of to the King and preſently at the command of the Lord

            The King ariuing at the ſhippes ſide, was intertained moſt graciouſly by the Denmarke king to his ſhippe, with the Prince, Nobles, and Gentlemen of his traine. Which by King Iames, the Prince, and Nobles, was againe requited with Kingly embracings, and moſt honourable entertainement to this Country. Like honourable fauours and g

            The two Kings and the Prince in his barge, were placed, and the Noblemen of England
               
courteouſly entertained into their companies, the Noble men, and beſt of the King of Denmarks traine.

The Admitall diſcharged ſuch a thundering peale of Ordinance, whereof many are Cannones of braſſe, as the ſmoake dimmed the ſkies, and their noyſe was heard a farre way off: after her, the vice and reere Admiral, and ſo all the reſt, which made a long peale cuery ſhippe taking his turne very orderly in exceeding good ſort.
            By this time they came to the blocke-houſes ſituat neere Graueſend, who followed, in diſcharging their Ordinance in like manner, with ſuch good induſtry and care as was very well commended, and highly prayſed of both kings and their companies. This honorably welcome giuen and receiued, they paſſe the riuer, till they came to Greenewich: where the royall Court of England lay. All the way paſſing, the royall King of Denmarke, with many louing fauours ſhewed his hearts Ioy in imbracing the noble & moſt honourable Prince Henry.
            
            Being now on our Engliſh land, a more kinde welcome was againe begun, to all the ſtrangers. To behold the multitudes of people which came to ſee them, was admirable: eſpecially, hauing ſo ſmall knowledge of the Kings arriuall.
            
               
In royall manner they entred the Court at Greenewhich, where our gracious Queene Anne lay. vnto whom, you neede not doubt, but this happy tidings, and Kingly brothers company was moſt pleaſing and ioyfull: as appeared at their moſt royall and kingly meeting, of theſe moſt great Princes brother, and ſiſter: whoſe trauells he holdeth for pleaſure, and therein taketh great comfort, inioying the ſight and welfare of ſo high and mighty a Princeſſe his deare ſiſte. Queene Anne, and ſo toward and happye iſlue of their loynes, as were preſent, that in that in them and their preſence no Monarch of the earth might thinke a more happier contentment.
            This night being Friday at night, and the. 7. day of Iuly, the royall Kings repoſed themſelues in the Court, & Satterday all day and night, with great welcomes and ioy of either of them.
            On Sunday the 19 day, King Iames, accompanied with his brother of Denmarke, and Nobility of both kingdomes, verye rich in their courtlike attire, The King being in Engliſh faſhion, went to the Chappell, where they heard a learned Sermon, preached by the Reuorend Father, the Biſhop of Rocheſter. By all the way as they paſſed and returned, the Royall King with admiratiō, gaue great & honorable regard

            The time of dinner being come, the Garde of our King appointed to giue their attendance, on the Gentleman Sewer, carryed vp his Kingly vvands, where wanted not any thing, that could poſſibly be gotten, with Wine and Beere, plentifull, all ſerued vp in moſt honourable manner, with the noyſe and excellent Muſicke of Drummes and Trumpets, which mooued his Highneſſe to much delight.

But the Chronicles of theſe two vnited and famous Nations, to the end of all ages enſuing, ſhall record the honors giuen and receiued, betweene theſe two moſt famous and royall Brothers, Kings of England and Denmarke.
            
            
               
The dinner finiſhed, & the firſt Sunday, after his comming to the Court, innumerable was the numbers of Cittizens of London, as well of the better ſort, and gentrie, as the Commons, & other adioyning pariſhes, and townes, which flocked therherto ſee the Parſons of theſe two beloued and famous Kinges. The ſight of which people, might cauſe the greateſt Prince in the world to admire them, and in their admiration, to reioyce in ſo faire and pleaſant a ſight, of ſo many well demeaned people, but more in the true loues to them. Both which was the cauſe of their comming thether.
            This Sunday ſpent in Gods praiſes, and their comfort. On Munday in the forenoone being the 20. of Iuly. Theſe gracious Kinges accompaned with our Royall Prince, and manye Honorable perſons moſte ritchly mounted on Steedes of great priſe, and furniture fayre, hunted in the Parke at Greenewich, and killed two Buckes.
            Afternoone, their high eſtates, went to Eltham a houſe of his Maieſties, ſome two miles diſtant from the Court, where in the parke they hunted with great pleaſure, and killed three Buckes on Horſebacke, being followed with many companies of people, which in their loues, came to ſee them: whereof a greate many, not vſed to followe ſuch pleaſures as hunting, eſpecially being on foote, thought not on their paines but in ioy of their hearts, (which no doubt was pleaſing

vnto them, they endeuoured with all their power to follow after their horſes, as neuer wearied in the view of ſo royall company, thinking themſelues moſt happy (of many other) to behold ſo rare & excellent a ſight, two kings & a prince. & ſurely in the opinion of many, their royal perſons might take great pleaſure to heare their continual cries to God for his bleſsing, and to preſerue them, their ſtates and dignities, from all mallice and traytors practiſes, for euer.
            The Sun growing nearer to his place of reſt, their pleaſures finiſhed, and they returned themſelues to the Court, all the way pacing eaſilye, that the people might the better obtaine their deſires in beholding of them.
            This firſt dayes pleaſure with greate delight finiſhed, they repoſed themſelues vntill Thurſday the 24 of Iuly, at which time the morning beeing fayre, everye man in his place gaue their attendance, the Barges wayted for their Majeſtyes, which about a x

There hence they ſet forwardes the way that leadeth to Stratford, and ſo to Theobals twelue miles diſtant from London a famous and moſt delightfull houſe of the Right Honorable Earle of Salsburie, all the way met with great companye of people, which ſaluted them and prayed for their happines, but moſte eſpecially vntill they came three or foure miles frō 
               London, all which way was ſo repleniſhed with men and women of good ſorte, ſome on foote, ſome on horſebacke, and ſome in Coaches, that there was hardlye way left for their royall companie to paſſe them, ſuch is the loue of this nation to the King and his Louers and friendes, and in their loue, their deſires ſo great to beholde their delights, that no paine (whatſoeuer) but they eſteeme as pleaſure, to inioy it, eſpeciallye to beholde ſo honorable and heauenly ſight, two anoynted kinges, and ſo royall a Prince, whome God in his greate mercie euermore preſerue, and keepe from all Trayterous practiſes, and other euils. A men.
            Before theſe Royall perſons came (neere the houſe of Theobals) there was ſtrewed in the highwayes aboundance ofleaues, coloured greene, cut like Oaken leaues, on euery one of which was written in large Romaine Letters of golde, (Welcome, Welcome) which beeing preſented to their Majeſties, they prayſed the deuice, and found their welcomes as great to them and theirs, as was ſpoken of.
            At this moſte beautifull houſe, after their welcomes

giuen by this moſte bountifull Earle, Patrone of that famous place, they ſpent their times foure nights and dayes, where they receiue many great delights in hunting in the Chaces & Parkes neere adioyning, where they killed ſtore of Deere, with great pleaſure.
            Some other times they ſpent in vewing the admirable pleaſures that place affordeth, beholding in great delight the ſweet groaues, gardens, and walkes, which with ſuch rare workmanſhippe is ſo beautified, and for varyetie ſo exceedeth, that time ſtealeth too faſt away, for the beholders, eſpeciallye where Iudiciall eyes dooth take pleaſures therein, ſo rich, rare and of ſuch exquiſite perfection is that place, that a man may fayle in diſcribing the ſame, but cannot ſuddainly be wearyed with manye times viewing & reuiewing thereof.
            On Sunday they reſt from their pleaſures, giuing the honor of that day to him that ſanctified the ſame, and hearing learned Sermons.

            On Munday, being the 28. of Iuly, after dinner, they leaue that place, retourning gracious thankes to this worthie Earle for their cheere and pleaſures, wh

                doth appliud and for euer will commend in all places the renowned Earle

and his moſt kinde & royal entertainmēt, they receiued at this famous houſe of Theobals by his bounue.
            The ſame night they returned againe to Blackwall, and from thence to Greenewich, where our gracious Queene Anne (the hearts delight of theſe two royall Kings) kept her Court, vnto whoſe gracious and moſte louing companye they were welcome, where, to the protection of the God of all glory and peace we leaue them, who euer defend them and all theirs.

                haue I brought to end the firſt welcome & ariual of this famous ſtranger King, with his beginning of progreſſe to Gods glorie, their great pleaſure, and content of manye thouſands, whoſe deſires were inriched with beholding their perſons.
            At this place of Greenwich they repoſe themſelues vntill Thurſday, which was the 31. of Iuly, and the day appointed for their comming through the citty, where they ſpent the time in ſolacing themſelues, with her gracious Maieſty, the Prince and Nobles of his court.
            About two of the clocke in the after noone, the tide ſeruing them to goe to London, theſe two Royall Kings accompained with the Prince, and Honorable priuie Counſell, the Lordes and eſtates of the Land, & a moſte worthy company of Knightes and Eſquires, The Kinges Barges giuing their attendance, their royall perſons came aboorde and were rowed towards London.
            
               
By the way as they paſſed, they were ſaluted with great peales of Ordinance, from the Merchants ſhips which ridde in the Thames, the gunners of them ſo carefully applyed their buſines, that they were highly commended for their care: And their owners which were at charge thereof, had thereby great commendatiōs. With theſe delights and other muſicall noyſe of Drums and Trumpets, they paſſed on vntill they came to the Tower-wharſſe, where thoſe moſte gracious Kinges and Royall Prince landed.
            There they made no long ſtay, but as ſudainely as the Traine could bee marſhalled according to their auncient manner, they ſet forwards, where the kinges was entertained by that worthye Magiſtrate Sir Leonard Hollyday, Lord Maior of the honorable Citie of London, who deliuered the Sword vnto his Highnes, who graciouſly receiued it, and then proceeded.
            The Marſhals of the Cittie firſt, who had with great care, & deſerued cōmendatiōs for their trauailes, from the morning verie carely rid vp & downe the Cittie, carefully ouerſeeing the multitudes of People which came to be partakers of theſe royal ſights, who by the ſtraight cōmaun demēt receiued from the Lord maior and Aldermen for the peoples ſafeties, that no harme might befal any of the cōpanies: ſo highly, & with ſuch great regard did they apply themſelues in placing and gouerning them, that thereby much harme was preuented,

which might otherwiſe haue happened by the vnruly multitude, as is oftententimes ſeene at ſuch times and places.
            The Marſhals had allowed for their attendance 12. men, ſuted in yellow Fuſtian, with aſh coloured hats, red bands and red ſcarfes, and each a up-ſtaffe in their hands.
            Next them, two trumpetters of his Maieſties, after whome followed the Knight-Marſhals men of his highneſſe houſhold, a famous & moſt worthie knight Sir Thomas Vauiſor. Theſe his followers were all ſuited in clay collour cloakes, ſtreamed with ſiluer lace, white Doublets and greene hoſe, with white hattes, the bandes rowled white and greene, and guarded in the brimme with greene ſilke: of this company was twentie three perſons:
            Then followed the Meſſengers in their coates very richly embrodered to the number of fourteene, then a Harrold of armes,
            After whome followed his Maieſties Trumpetters, led by their Serieant in a cloake of Carnation Veluet, bearing the ſiluer Mace of his office, and the reſt of his company to the number of xiiij in their liuerie coates, verrie rich and well mounted. Thē followes the kings of Denmarkes Drume riding vpon a horſe, with two Drums one of each ſide the horſe necke, whereon hee ſtrooke two little mallets of wood, a thing verie admirable to the common ſort, and much admired.
            
               
Then follow the Denmarke Kinges Trumpeters, beeing aleuen in all, decently attyred after our Engliſh faſhion, in Cloackes of Watched, guarded with blacke and ſtriped white; Blew Veluet Hoſe, and white Satten Doublets trimmed with Siluer Lace; White Hattes, with Bandes imbrodered with Gold.
            With this companie, the Kinges Guarde began to come forwarde; which marched Souldier like by the ſides of the Traine (for a time) to keepe the way.
            After them, more Harroldes, in their rich Coates; Then the Kinges Gentlemen, and Courtiers, being moſt gallantly mounted, and rich in their Apparell.
            Then a troope of moſt gallant Knighes: of whoſe riches a number may admyre: of whom, many of them wore ſtrange Fethers, of rich and great eſſteeme: which they called, The Birdes of Paradice.
            
            Theſe paſsing on, follow the Knightes of the Bathe, ſo richly garniſhed both in Apparell, riche Iewelles, with gallant Horſes, and coſtly furniture, that all the Princes of the world may admire to heare thereof: But more, to ſee the moſt exceeding richneſſe, and moſt gallant perſonages of them.
            Then follow more Harroldes: the worſhipfull Deane of his Maieſties Chappell, and one other with him.
            Then Barrons, and the Nobilite of Englande, of the younger fort; very rich, and well attended vpon: The Maiſters of his honorable Court of Requeſtes.
            Then the Sargiants at Armes, with their riche

Maces, in number nine.
            Then the reuerent Lord Archbyſhop of Canterburie his Grace, the Lord Byſhop of London, and others.
            Then the right Honourable Earle of Salisburie, and other Earles, both of the Counſell, and others: amongſt whom, were placed in great honour, the Lordes and chiefeſt of the Demnarke Kinges Nobilitie and Counſell: who wore the moſt part of them, rich Iewels on their left Breaſtes: all men of great grauitie, and ſeemely perſonages.
            Then came the right honorable Earle of Nottingham, Lord high Admirall of Englande, who carried the Sword: and betweene two other two, the Lord Mayre of London, who carryed a Mace.
            Then came the moſt gracious Prince HENRIE, whoſe ſweete, and moſt Maieſticall grace and fauour, the whole company with due honour to his Grace, did applaude, and pray for his moſt gracious Father, and all theirs, in all health to continue.
            Then follow theſe two famours Honours of Eſtate and Maieſtie, the two KINGES, our dread Soueraigne, and his beloued Brother, Christiane the fourth King of Denmarke: who regarding more the true loue of their Nation, then gorgious Apparell; whereof they haue plentie: yet in their P

            Theſe two moſt famous Brother Kinges, ryding in ſuch loue, and in Maieſtie ſo ſurpaſsing, did ſo ioy the heartes of their Subiectes, and the whole world may admire: yea, ſuch was the honour of this day in London, and exceeding ioy, to beholde theſe two famous Kinges, and their vnitie, as will, while they haue any beeing, neuer be raſed out of memorie.
            Theſe royall Kinges paſſed, after them followed the right Honorable Earle of Worceſter, one of his priuic Counſell, and Maiſter of the Horſe.

into this Land, as they be admired at, in all chriſtian Kinges Countries, for their Perſons, ciuill gouernement, and kinde entertainement of Sraungers.
            The Traine thus marching, as I haue deſcribed, rid on til they came to Cheapſide: al the way as theſe two famous Kinges paſſed from the Tower-hill, ſtood the Companies of London, in their Lyueries Gownes, and Hoodes: for whom there was Places double rayled; which was hanged with blew Broad-cloth; and the Rayles garniſhed with Auncients very richly guylt with the Kinges Armes of England; the Auncients of Silke of each Hall, with Streamers and Pendants of their Armes, and ſeuerall Fellowſhips, the better to be knowen.
            The Windowes and Penthouſes richly decked with Arrace, and other coſtly hanginges.
            With great admiration, paſſed theſe famous Kinges, till they came to Cheapſide, viewing the numbers of people, which ſtood in Windowes, the Streetes, and other places, ſhewing louely and gracious aſpectance of their loues, by their fauourable countenance.
            In their paſſing at the great Conduit in Cheapſide, was made with greene Boughes, a very artificiall Arboure, which was garniſhed with all ſortes of delightfull Fruites. In this Arbour was placed moſt

ſweete Muſicke; which greatly delighted the hearers, and no doubt pleaſed his Maieſtie.
            At the little Conduit as they proceeded, there was erected a moſt ſtately Pagant; ſuch as for the rare deuice and beautie, was, and is to be admired, and hath ſeldome been ſeene: a matter of ſuch ſtate, and rare edifice, in ſo ſhort time to be accompliſhed, the workmen and plotters thereof, hauing not paſt twelue dayes of reſpit, after their firſt warning.
            Heere theſe moſt famous Princes, and moſt admired Kinges ſtayed, beholding the deuiſes, and rareneſſe of the ſame: vnto whom were deliuered (in name of the Lord Mayre and his Brethren the Aldermen, which ſtood neere them in their Scarlet Gownes, and all the Commons of the Citie,) a moſt pleaſing ſpeach: which ended, the Kinges gaue the Citie thankes, and proceeded, till they came to Paules Churchyard.
            Where at the Schoole of the Worſhipfull Companie of Mearcers, called Paules Schoole, there were other delightfull ſpeaches deliuered: to which they graciouſly harkoned, and honorably accepted.
            Then rode they on without ſtay, to Fleete Conduit, which was garniſhed ſweetely: on the toppe was placed delightfull Muſicke; and were preſented with other ſpeaches, which was graciouſly accepted.
            When they came to Saint Dunſtans Church, they

were preſented with a noyſe of Cornets, which ſhewed their cunning to be excellent, and very pleaſing to both their Maieſties.
            Heere-hence they proceeded to Temple-barre: where his Maieſtie, and his brother King, giuing many thankes to the Lord Mayre and Cit
                  •
               zens, for their great charge and paines, deliuered the Sword to the Lord Mayre; and rode on their way to Somerſet Houſe: wherere they repoſed themſelues that night, and to their Gracious further pleaſures.
            The Lord Mayre returning, was mette by the Sheriffes and Aldermen of the Cittie, who accompanied him to his houſe.
            Thus finiſhed this dayes worke, to Gods glorie, their Highnes great delight: which the omnipotent giuer of all grace, and preſeruer of his, euer encreaſe, and protect them, and all their royall progenie from all deteſtable practiſes in this world: and in the laſt, Heauen be their inheritaunce. Amen, Amen.
