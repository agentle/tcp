COPIE OF A LETTER
SENT OVT OF
ENGLAND TO DON BERNARDIN
MENDOZA AMBASSADOVR IN FRANCE FOR
the King of Spaine, declaring the state of England, contrary
to the opinion of Don Bernardin, and of all
his partizans Spaniardes and others.
            This Letter, although it was sent to Don Bernardin Mendoza,
yet, by good hap, the Copies therof aswell in English as in French, were
found in the chamber of one Richard Leigh a Seminarie Priest,
who was lately executed for high treason committed in the
time that the Spanish Armada was on the seas.
            Whereunto are adioyned certaine late Aduertisements, concerning the
losses and distresses happened to the Spanish Nauie, aswell in fight with the
English Nauie in the narrow seas of England, as also by tempests, and contrarie
winds, vpon the West, and North coasts of Ireland, in their
returne from the Northerne Isles beyond
Scotland.

            THE COPIE OF A LETTER
SENT OVT OF ENGLAND
TO DON BERNARDINE MENDOZA AMBASSADOVR
IN FRANCE FOR THE
KING OF SPAINE.
            
               
                  
                     MY Lord Ambassadour, though at the
time of my last large writing to you of
the state of this countrey, & of our long
desired expectation of succours promised,
I did not thinke to haue had such a
sorrowfull occasion of any second writing,
as nowe I haue of a lamentable
change of matters of estate here: yet I
can not forbeare (though it be with as
many sighs as liues) to aduertise you of the truth of our miserable
condition, as now to me & others of our partie the same
appeareth to be: that by comparing of all things past in hope,
with the present nowe in despaire, your L. who haue had the
principall managing hitherto of all our causes of long time
both here & there in France, betwixt the King Catholique assisted
with the Potentates of the holy League, & all our countrimen
which haue professed obedience to the Church of Rome,
may now fall into some new & better consideration, how our
state both for our selues at home, and our brethren abroade,
now at this present fallen (as it were) into vtter despaire, may
be reuiued & restored to some new hope, with better assurance
of successe then hath happened hitherto.In what termes England standeth in the opinion of the Catholiques. For which purpose I
haue thought it necessary to aduertise you in what termes this
countrey now standeth, farre otherwise then of late, both we
at home, and others abroad did make accompt of.
                  You know how we haue depended in firme hope of a change
of the state of this countrey by the meanes of the deuout and

earnest incitations of the Popes holines, and the King Catholique,
and of other Potentates of the holy League, to take vpon
them the Inuasion and conquest of this Realme: and by your
assurances, and firme promises, we were now of a long season
past perswaded, that the King Catholique had taken vpon him
the same glorious Act, and thereof from yeare to yeare we looked
for the execution: being continually fed and nourished
from you to continue our hope, and sundrie times solicited by
your earnest requests, and perswasions, to encourage our partie
at home not to wauer, as many were disposed, by sight of
continuall delaies, but to be ready to ioyne with the outward
forces that should come for this Inuasion. Neuerthelesse the
delayes and prolongations of times appointed for the comming
of the Kings forces, specially by Sea, haue bene so manie,
as vntill this last Spring, we were in despaire: at what
time you aduertised vs with great assurance that al the Kings
preparations,The Spanish preparation three yeeres in making. which had bene in making readie these thrée
or foure yeares together, were now in full perfection, and
without faile would this Sommer come into our Seas with
such mightie strength, as no Nauie of England, or of Christendome,
could resist or abide their force: and for more suretie,
and for auoiding of all doubts, to make the intended conquest
sure, the same should also haue ioyned to it, the mightie
Army which the Duke of Parma had made readie,The Duke of Parmas army in Flaunders. and kept in
readinesse in the low countries all this yeare past, wherewith
he should land, and so both by Sea and land, this Realme
should be inuaded, and a spéedie conquest made thereof, to the
which were alwaies added sundry reasons: whereupon was
gathered,No forreine force coulde inuade England, without a strong party in England. that neither by sea, nor by land, there would be any
great resistance found here, but a strong party in this Realme
to ioyne with the forreine force. For otherwise then with such
helps, to be assuredly had from hence, I know, it was alwaies
doubted that no forreine force could preuaile against thisHope of victorie by the Spanish Army with assistance of a partie in England this Sommer.
realme, being (as it is) enuironed by sea, and notably replenished
with more mightie and stronger people then any country
in Christendome. But with the hope of the landing of these
great Armies and our assistance in taking part, we here continued

all this yeare past in assured hope of a full victorie, vntill
this last moneth. But alas and with a deadly sorrow, we must
all at home, and abroad, lament our sudden fall, from an immeasurable
high ioy, to an vnmeasurable déepe despaire, and
that so hastilie fallen out, as I may say, we haue séene in the
space of eight or nine dayes in this last moneth of Iuly,All Spanishe hope fallen in nine daies. which
was from the apparance of the Catholique great Nauie vpon
the coast of England, vntill it was forced to flie from the coast
of Flanders neare Callice, towardes the vnknowen parts of
the cold North, all our hopes, all our buildings, as it now
appeareth but vpon an imagined conquest, vtterly ouerthrowen,
and as it were with an earthquake, all our castles of
comfort brought to the ground, which now (it séemeth) were
builded but in the aire, or vpon waues of the sea, for they are
all perished, all vanished away from our thoughtes.
                  And here with I am astonished what I may best thinke of
such a worke so long time in framing, to be so suddenly ouerthrown,
as by no reason could procéed of man, or of any earthly
power,The Catholiques doubt, of their cause seeing the hād of God is against the Armie. but only of God. And if so it be (as no body can otherwise
impute this late change & fall from our expected fortune,
but to God almighty) then surely our case is either dangerous
or doubtfull how to iudge thereof, whether we haue bene these
many yeares in the right or not. For I do find, and know, that
many good, and wise men, which of long time haue secretly
continued in most earnest deuotion to the Popes authoritie,Many English Catholiques mislike of the Popes reformatiō by force.
begin now to stagger in their mindes, and to conceiue that this
way of reformation intended by the Popes holines is not allowable
in the sight of God, by leauing the auncient course of
the Church by Excommunication, which was the exercise of
the spirituall sword, and in place thereof to take the temporall
sword, and put it into a Monarches hand to inuade this realme
with force and Armes, yea to destroy the Quéene thereof, and
all her people addicted to her: which are in very truth now
féene, by great proofe this yeare, to be in a sort infinite, and inuincible,
so as some begin to say that this purpose by violence,
by blood, by slaughter, & by conquest, agréeth not with Christes
doctrine, nor the doctrine of S. Peter, or S. Paule. And to tell your

Lordship truly, I finde presently a great number of wise and
deuout people, though they continue in their former religion,
yet do they secretely condemne this intended reformation by
blood and force. Insomuch that I heard a good diuine alledge a
textout of S. Gregorie in these words, Quid de Episcopis qui verberibus
timeri volunt Canones dicunt benè paternitas vestra nouit,
pastores sumus nō percussores. Noua enim est predicatio quae verberibus
exigit fidem. This sentence I obtained of him, because it
séemeth to be charitably written. But leauing this authoritie
among Doctors, I must néedes say that in very trueth no one
thing hath done at this time more hurt to the action, then the
vntimely hasty publishing abroad in this Realme before this
Armie of Spaine was readie to come foorth to the seas,The vntimely publishing of the intended conquest before the Spanish nauy was redy, did great hurt. of sundrie
things written and put in Print, & sent into this realme,
to notifie to the people, that all the Realme should be inuaded
and conquered, that the Quéene should be destroied, al the Nobilitie,
& men of reputation, of honour, and wealth that did
obey her, and would defend her, or that would withstand the
Inuasion, should be with all their families rooted out, and their
places,The heartes of all sorts of people enflamed against the Spaniards vaunting to conquer the land. their honours, their houses and landes bestowed vpon
the conquerers: things vniuersally so odiously taken, as the
harts of all sorts of people were enflamed: some with ire, some
with feare, but all sortes almost, without exception, resolued
to venture their liues for the withstanding of all maner of
conquest, wherewith euery body can say this Realme was not
threatned these fiue hundreth yeares and more.
                  These reports were brought to this realme with good credit,
not in secret but in publique writings & printings, and tooke
déepe roote in all kind of people of this land, and in déede was of
the more credit,The vntimely publication of the Popes Bull did hurt to the common cause. first by reason of a new Bull lately published
at Rome by the Popes holines, which I haue séene, with
more seueritie then other of his predecessours, whereby the
Quéene here was accursed, and pronounced to be depriued of
her Crowne & the Inuasion, and conquest of the Realme committed
by the Pope, to ye 
                     King Catholique, to execute the same
with his armies both by sea and land, and to take the Crowne
to him selfe, or to limit it to such a Potentate as the Pope & he

should name. And secondly, there followed a large explanation
of this Bull, by sending hither a number of English bookes
printed in Antwerp euen when the Nauy of Spaine was daily
looked for, the originall whereof was written by the reuerend
father Cardinall Allen in Aprill last,Cardinall Allens bookes haue done much hurt to the intended inuasion and conquest. called in his owne
writing the Cardinall of England, which booke was so violently,
sharply, and bitterly written, yea (say the Aduersaries) so
arrogantly, falsly, and slaunderously, against the person of the
Quéene, against her father King Henrie the eight, against all
her Nobilitie and Counsell, as in very truth I was heartily
sory to perceiue so many good men of our owne religion offended
therewith, in that there should be found in one accompted
a father of the Church, who was also a borne subiect of this
crowne (though by the Aduersaries reported to be very basely
borne) such foule, vile, irreuerent, and violent spéeches, such
ireful and bloody threatnings, of a Quéene, of a Nobilitie, yea
of the whole people of his owne nation.
                  Sory,The Cardinals rash & violent writing missiked by the Catholiques. and most sory I am to report the generall cuill conceipt
of these vnordinate and vnaduised procéedings of this
Cardinall, of whose rash choise to such a place, the world speaketh
strangely, as though he came to it through corruption of
the Popes sister, without liking of the Colledge of Cardinals,
where otherwise the blessed intention of our holy Father, and
the desire also of the said Cardinall, might without such fatall
bloody premonitions and threatnings of future Inuasions
and conquests by the Catholique Kings noble forces, haue taken
better place.
                  There was also to adde the more credite to these terrible
prognostications,The multitude of bookes published to shewe the greatnes of the Spanishe Nauy, did also hurt such kind of other bookes printed in Spaine
and translated into French, (as it is said by your Lorship)
containing particular long descriptions, and catalogues of
Armadas of Castile, of Andaluzia, of Biscaye, of Guipusque, of
Portingall, of Naples, of Sicil, of Ragusa, and other Countries
of the Leuant, with a masse of all kinde of prouisions, beyond
measure, for the said Armadas, sufficient in estimation, to be
able to make conquest of many kingdomes or countries. And
one great Argument is published by the Aduersaries to stirre

vp the mindes of the Nobilitie of England against the Spaniards,
which is very maliciously inuented, to shew the intention
of the conquest, not only of England, but of the whole Isle
of Britaine: mouing all men specially to marke by the descriptiō
of the Armada, that there are specially named such a number
of Noblemen, as Princes, Marquises, Condes and Dons,
that are called Aduenturers, without any office or pay, & such
another number also of men with great titles of honour, and
many of them named Captaines and Alferez, without office,
but yet in sold, and therefore called Entertenidos, as all those
being for no seruice in the Armada may be wel presumed (say
they) to haue come to haue possessed the roomes of all the Noblemen
in England, and Scotland: and this fiction hath taken
more place then it is worth. And though these armies were in
déede excéeding great and mightie, yet they were so amplified
beyond all measure in these bookes, as in no preparation of
Christendome in former times against the Sarracins or Turks
could be greater.The forewarninges of the Armadas greatnes caused the Queene to put all her Realme in force beyond all former. By this meanes this Queene and her realme,
being thus forewarned and terrified, tooke occasion with the
aide of her people, being not onely firmely (as she was perswaded)
deuoted to her, but throughly irritated, to stirre vp
their whole forces for their defence, against such prognosticated
conquests, as in a very short time all her whole Realme
and euery corner were spéedily furnished with armed people
on horsebacke, and on foote, and those continually trained, exercised,
and put into Bands, in warlike maner, as in no age
euer was before in this Realme. Here was no sparing of money
to prouide, horse, armour, weapon, powder, and all necessaries,
no not want of prouision of Pioners, carriages, and
victuals in euery Countie of the realme, without exception, to
attend vpon the Armies. And to this generall furniture euery
man voluntarily offered, very many their seruice personally
without wages, others money for armour and weapons, and
to wage souldiers, a matter strange and neuer the like heard
of in this realme or else where: And this general reason moued
all men to large contributions, that to withstand a Conquest
where all should be lost, there was no time to spare a portion.
                  
                     
The numbers made ready in the Realme I cannot affirme
of mine owne knowledge, but I haue heard it reported, when
I was gréeued to thinke the same to be so true, that there was
through England no quarter East, West, North and South,
                     The Armies made readie Nauie England in euery quarter of the realme. but
all concurred in one mynde to be in readines to serue for the
Realme: and that some one countrie was able to make a sufficient
Armie of twentie thousand men fit to fight, and fiftéene
thousand of them well armed & weaponed: and in some countries
the number of fortie thousand able men.
                  The maritime Countries from Cornewall,
                     The Maritime Countries prouided at lading places with twenty thousand men. all along the
Southside of England, to Kent: and from Kent Eastward, by
Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk to Lincolnshire (which Countries
with their Hauens were well described vnto you in perfect
Plots, when Francis Throgmorton, first did treat with your
Lordship about the same) were so furnished of men of warre,
both of themselues, & with resort of aide from their next shires,
as there was no place to be doubted for landing of any forrein
forces, but there were within eight and fortie houres to come
to the place aboue twentie thousand fighting mē on horsebacke
and on foote, with field ordinance, victuals, pioners and cariages,
and all those gouerned by the principal Noble men of the
Countries and reduced vnder Captaines of knowledge.
                  And one thing I heard of, that was very politikely ordered
and executed at this time, as of many late yeares was not vsed:
that as the Leaders & officers of the particuler Bāds were
men of experience in the warres: so to make the Bands strong
and constant,All the bands were vnder the principal Knights of the realme compounded of the most mightie men being their tenants and seruants. choise was made of the principall Knights of all
Countries to bring their renantes to the field, being men of
strength, & landed, & of wealth: whereby all the forces of compounded
were of a resolute disposition to sticke to their Lords
and Chieftaines, & the Chieftaines to trust to their owne tenants.
And to remember one strāge spéech that I heard spoken
may be marueiled at, but it was auowed to me for a truth,
that one Gentlemā in Kent had a Band of one hundred & fiftie
footmen,A strange report of the wealth of a band of souldiers. which were worth in goods aboue one hundred & fiftie
thousand pounds sterling, besides their lands▪ such men would
fight stoutely before they would haue lost their goods, and by

likelihood at this time, many other Bands were made of such
principall men, both of wealth and strength. Of these thinges
I am sory to haue cause to write in this sort: because you may
see how heretofore you haue bene deceiued with aduertisemēts
of many, which had no proofe to know the truth thereof, and so
I confesse my selfe in some thinges to haue erred, namely, in
imagining that whēsoeuer any forreine power should be séene
ready to land in any part of this Realme, there would haue
bene found but a small number resolute to withstand the same,
or to defend the Quéene, but that the same would haue bene
very vnable for the warres, vntrained, raw, and ignorant in
all warlike actions, without sufficient armour and weapons:
and that also the Noble men and Gentlemē that were in this
Realme of our Religion, whereof, you know, we made accōpt
when you were here in England of very many,An error of the Catholique fugitives in the number of their partners in England. although many
of thē be dead since that time, but at this time there are not
so many tens, as we accompted hundreds, whom we thought
would haue shewed them selues like men of courage for our
common cause, and would haue sodenly surprised the houses,
families, and strength of the heretiques and aduersaries.
                  But now, such is our calamitie, that it hath pleased God, as
I thinke for our sinnes, or els for confounding of our bold opinions,
and presumptions of our owne strength, to put in the
hearts of all persons here one like mynde, & courage to withstand
the intended Inuasion, as well in such as we accompted
Catholiques, as also in the Heretiques: so as it hath appeared
manifestly that for all earnest procéeding for arming, and
for contributions of money, and for all other warlike actions,
there was no difference to be séene betwixt the Catholique, and
the heretique.A consent and concurrencie of Papistes and Protestants to withstand the conquest. But in this case to withstand the threatned conquest,
yea to defend the person of the Quéene, there appeared
such a sympathie, concourse, and consent of all sortes of persons,
without respect of Religion, as they all appeared to be
ready to fight against all strangers, as it were with one heart
and one body. And though some few principall Gentlemen,
of whom heretofore you haue had the names in such Catalogues
of Catholiques as you haue bene acquainted withall,

werelately vpon the report of the comming out of the Armie
to the seas, sent to the Isle of Ely there to remaine restrained
of their former libertie during the expectation of this intended
Inuasion: yet it hath appeared, that they were not so restrained
for any doubt that they would with their powers haue assisted
our Army, but onely thereby to make it knowen to all
our friends and countrimen in Spaine, and Flaunders, yea
euen to your selfe (for so I heard it spoken, as accompting you
to haue bene the most principall Author and perswader of this
action) that there should be no hope to haue any of them, or of
their fréends, to assist these great Armies. And in very truth,
I see now whosoeuer of our fréends in Spaine or in Flaunders,
or els where, made any such accompt of any aide against
the Quéene, or against her partie here, they should haue bene
deceaued if the Army had offered to haue landed.The gentlemen Recusants in Elie offer to aduenture then liues against all inuasions whatsoeuer, without respect of Pope or other potentate. For I my
selfe haue heard that the best of those that were sent to Elie did
make offers, yea by their letters to the Counsell here, signed
with their hands, that they would aduenture their liues in defence
of the Quéene, whom they named their vndoubted Soueraigne
Lady and Queene, against all forrein forces, though the
same were sent from the Pope or by his commandement: Yea
diuers of them did offer that in this quarell of inuading of the
Realme with strangers, they would present their owne bodies
in the formost rankes with their countrie men against all
strangers. Whereupon I heard also by a secrete friende of
mine in the Court, that it was once in some towardnes of resolution
amongst the Counsellers, that they should haue bene
returned and put to their former libertie. But the heate of the
warre being kindled with the knowledge of the Kings Armada,
being at that time come to the Groigne, and the Duke
of Parmas readines with so great an Armie and shipping in
Flaunders, daily looked for to land in England, yea to come
to London, and a generall murmur of the people against all
such Recusants of reputation, was the cause of the staying of
these Gentlemen at Elie, notwithstanding their offers of their
seruice to the Quéene: and so they doe remaine in the Bishops
pallace there, with fruition of large walkes about the same,

altogether without any imprisonment, other then that they
are not suffred to depart into the towne, or countrey: and yet
for their religion,The Recusants are not put in danger of their liues for their religion, but are fined at summes of money. I thinke surely they doe, and will, remaine
constant to the obedience of the Church of Rome: for the which
neuerthelesse they are not impeached to any danger of their
liues, but only charged with a penalty of money, because they
will not come to the Churches: whereby, by the law, a portion
of their Reuenue is alotted to the Quéene, and the rest left to
the maintenance of them, their wiues, and children.
                  By which kind of procéedings our Aduersaries here do pretend,
that both these Gentlemen, and all other of their qualities
are fauourably vsed, that they are not pursued to death for
their religion, as they say it was vsed in Quéene Maries time,
and as it is daily vsed (as they say) most rigorously and barbarously
in Spaine against the Englishmen that come thither,
onely in trade of marchandise. And yet I and others sometimes
priuately speaking with such our Aduersaries, as wée
thinke are not maliciously bent to haue men prosecuted to
death only for their Religion (for to say the truth, and as the
prouerbe is, not to belie the Diuel, very many of our Contraries
are in that point not vncharitable) we doe obiect to them
the executions by cruell torments & deaths of very many, both
here about London, and other parts of the Realme, whom we
accompt as Martirs, in that they do witnes by their death their
obedience to the Pope, and the Catholique Church of Rome.
                  To which, these our Aduersaries pretēding some small dropsThe Iesuits are not executed for religion but for treasons.
of charity do answere vs: that no execution hath bene of any, to
their knowledge, for their religiō, or for profession thereof: but
for that they which haue bene executed, haue bene found to
haue wandred in the Realme secretly, & in a disguised maner,The Seminaries for the most part come disguised like Ruffians.
which the Aduersaries scornfully terme as Ruffians, with fethers
and all ornaments of light coloured apparell, like to the
fashion of Courtiers, and doe vse many meanes to entice all
people, with whom they dare aduenture to speake, not onely
to be reconciled to the Pope, and Church of Rome, but to induce
them by vowes and othes to renounce, their obedience to
the Quéene: to deny her to be their soueraigne: and themselues

to be discharged of their Alleageance: and to repute all Magistrates
vnder her to be vnlawfull, and in conscience not to be
obeyed: with many moe such matters (which I neuerthelesse
count to be very vaine calumniations) tending to make the
facts of all such holy Priests as are sent with Commission to
winne mens soules to be direct treasons against the Quéene,
and the state of the Realme.
                  These Defenders of these iudgements and executions, contend,
and do most earnestly maintaine, that all such Priests,
Iesuites, Seminaries and others, so perswading the people against
the Quéene, the Lawes, the Gouernment, and state of
the Realme, and all others that are so perswaded by them, are
manifest traitors: and so they say that their enditements, and
all proces of law extended and pursued against them, doe manifestly
declare the same. Wherein, these our Aduersaries do
sometimes for maintenance of their arguments, shew the very
copies of their enditements and iugdements, wherin there
is no mention made of charging them with their religion, but
that they haue attempted to perswade the Quéenes subiects to
forsake their Allegeance, and consequently to be Rebels to
their Quéene and Soueraigne.
                  In this sort these men for their aduantage, doe at all times,
with these and many like earnest arguments maintaine their
procéedings against the holy Priests & Iesuites, that haue suffred
death for their conscience, as iust & necessary. And though,
where I and others may reply without perill to our selues (as
surely in some small companies we may vsing modest words)
we obiect the confession of the Catholique faith by the parties
at their death, and that with great constancie, which our Aduersaries
cannot denie,Babington suffered for his treasons voluntarily cōfessed, not for religion: though at his death hee professed the Romane religion. so as it may seeme they die for their religion:
yet is it on the other part against vs alleaged, & maintained,
that they are neither indited, condemned, nor executed
for their religion, or for offering of them selues to die for their
religion, but onely for their former treasons in conspiring against
the Quéene, and state of the Realme: no otherwise
then of late time Babington and all his Complices, who were
condemned for their attempt to haue raised warre in the

Realme, and to haue murdered the Quéene, and to haue set vp
the Quéene of Scots, all which the said Babington and all his
complices voluntarily confessed, and were codemned and executed,
onely for those their great treasons: and yet diuers of
them at the place of their execution, did in like maner (as these
Priests and Iesuites vse to doe) make confession of their Catholique
faith, with offer to die for the same: and yet (say our
Aduersaries) it ought not to be affirmed, that Babington and
his complices were put to death for religion, but for their treasons.
                  And for further maintenance of the coloured arguments,
wherewith I, and others my good, faithfull, and Catholique
brethren are often troubled how to answere them, it is alleaged
that the great number of gentlemen, & gentlewomen, yea
some of honourable calling,A multitude of gentlemen suspected to be Papists, yet neuer indangered of their liues. and of other meaner degrées, are
knowne manifestly to be of a contrary religion to the lawes
of the Realme, both néere the Court and farre of, and yet they
are neuer pursued by any fourme of law to put their liues in
danger, or questioned, or imprisoned, for their opinions in religion,
whereby to bring them in any danger. Onely such as
are presented or complained of by the parishioners where they
dwell, for neuer comming to any Church by the space of certaine
moneths in a whole yeare, are therof endited, and afterward
being called to answere thereto, if they can shew no such
lawfull excuse as the law hath prouided, they are then condemned
to pay a penaltie out of their goods and lands, if they
haue any, and not otherwise punished, nor yet by inquisition
any of them examined of their faith. But yet say these defenders,
if they shew them selues by their open déeds and facts to
be reconciled from their Alleageance and obedience to the
Quéene, and that they will therein persist, then they are therewith
charged and punished according to the lawes therefore
prouided.
                  These arguments in their defence I doe not repeate as allowing
of thē, but yet surely they do moue me, & some others
that are wise, to thinke, that indéed the rashnes of diuers comming
secretely into the Realme, & professing themselues to be

Priestes,Many of the Priests that are sent into the realm, are yong, rash, & of leude life. many of them being both very young, vnlearned,
and of light behauiour, hath done great harme to the goodnesse
of our common cause: and if they and such others could haue
temperately and secretly instructed the people, and vsed more
circumspection in their owne liuing & behauiour, there would
haue bene a greater increase of numbers perswaded in conscience
to haue ioyned with vs in our profession. Whereof I
am the bolder to write to you, my Lord, that you may conferre
with our countrimen, that haue accesse vnto you, and
that they also may deale with the Fathers of the Iesuites, that
more care and choice be had of such English men as are hereafter
to be sent into England, and not to send euery yong man
that hath more boldnesse, then learning and temperance, for
such a function.
                  In the former part of this my declaration to you of the vniuersall
concurrence of all men of value, wealth, and strength,
in the body of the Realme, to serue and defend the Quéene &
the Realme,A great strēgth of the English Nauie, by the Shippes of the port townes that did serue without wages. I forgot to report vnto you the great numbers of
Ships of the subiectes of the Realme: as of London and other
port townes, and cities, that voluntarily this yeare were armed,
able to make a full Nauie of themselues for an armie, &
all at the proper costes of the Burgesses, for certain moneths,
with men, victuall, and munition, which did ioyne with the
Quéenes owne Nauie all this Sommer, a thing neuer in any
former age heard of, otherwise then that such ships were alwayes
hired, waged, & victualled by the Kings of the Realme,
which argued to the griefe of me and some others a most vehement
and vnaccustomed affection & deuotion in the Cities and
port townes, such, as they shewed them selues therein ready
to fight, as it had bene, pro aris & focis.
                  
                  Of the number and strength of the Quéenes owne ships of
warre, I thinke you haue bene sufficiently enfourmed many
times heretofore. But yet I will make you a true report of
the state of them this present Sommer, what I haue credibly
heard thereof: because I haue bene very sory to heare how
you & others haue bene therein abused: and that not onely in
this matter of the Quéenes ships, but in some other things also

of late, whereof some part hath bene here by very many,
maliciously, and in common spéeches, imputed to your owne
inuention and publication: whereof in a few wordes I will
make some digression before I shall shewe the estate of the
Quéenes Nauie.
                  In this Sommer past there was Printed in Paris, by your
direction (as it was reported) a notable vntruth,Two notable lies printed in Paris, and imputed to Don Bernardin Mendoza. which I did
sée, & reade: that the King of Scots had besieged Barwicke, and
had won it by assault, and possessed it quietly: whereof no part
was true, nor any cause to imagine the same, though I wish it
had so bene: but not for any good will that I now beare to that
King, but for the trouble to this Quéene. For in truth there is
no good for vs to be hoped for from the King of Scots, howsoeuer
the Scottish Bishops in France haue sought to make you
beléeue otherwise, who is so rooted in the Caluinists Religion,
as there is neuer hope that he can be recouered to the church of
Rome: and so I thinke you are of late duely enfourmed, and by
his violent actions against diuers Catholiques, & against all
that fauour the Spaniards, may certainly appeare.
                  And likewise another great vntruth was lately Printed
(as your enemies say) by your direction also in Paris,
                     A most manifest lie printed in Paris, of a Spanish victory when it was altogether an English victorie. that
now in Iuly last, when the Spanish Fléete and English had
met and fought betwixt France and England, the Spaniards
had then a great victorie, wherein they had sonke the Lord Admirall
of England, with sixtéene of the Quéenes great ships
into the bottome of the Seas, and that all the rest were driuen
to flie with the Uice admirall Frances Drake. Upon these two
so notable vntruthes, which the Aduersaries spitefully called
Don Bernardin Mendozas mendacia,
                     Mendacia of Mendoza. many who honour you,
were right sory, that you should giue so hastie credite, to publish
the same (as your enemies say) you did: though I haue to
my power for cléering of you honour giuen it out, that these
and such like haue procéeded of the lightnes of the Frēch, who
cōmonly Print more lies then truths, in such doubtfull times,
and not of you, whose honour and wisedome I thought would
not be iustly touched with so great vntruthes and lies: considering
alwayes, a small time will discouer things that are in

facts reported vntruly, and bringeth the Authours to discredit
and infamy. There hath béene a spéech also reported here, to
haue procéeded from you in France, that hath caused a great
misliking of you in Scotland: which is, that you should in open
assembly, and in a brauery say, that the young King of Scots
(whom you called in your language a boy) had deceiued the
King your master: but if the Kings Nauy might prosper against
England, the King of Scots should loose his Crowne:
and of this the King of Scots hath bene aduertised out of
France, and vseth very euill language of you, which I will
not report.
                  But now to leaue this digression, and to returne to let you
know the truth of the state of the Quéens Nauy this Sommer.The state of the Nauie of England this Sommer.
The same was in the beginning of the yeare, when the brute
was brought of the readines of the Kings Armada in Lisbone,
and of the Army by land vpon the Sea coasts in Flanders with
their shipping, deuided into thrée companies: the greatest vnder
the charge of Charles L. Haward high Admirall of England,L. Haward, L, Admirall.
whose father, grandfather, vncles, great vncles, and others
of his house, being of the noble house of the Dukes of
Norfolke, had also bene high Admirals afore him, wherof both
France and Scotland haue had proofe.
                  An other company were appointed to remaine with the L.
Henry Seymour second son to the Duke of Somerset that was
Protector in King Edwards time,L. Henry Seymour. & brother to the now Earle
of Hartfort: and these companies for a time continued in the
Narrow seas betwixt England and Flanders, vnder the
charge of the said high Admirall, to attend on the Duke of Parmas
Actions.
                  A third company were armed in the West part of England
towards Spaine,Sir Francis Drake. vnder the conduct of Sir Francis Drake: a
man by name and fame knowne too too well to all Spaine, and
to the Kings Indias, and of great reputation in England: and
this was compounded, partly of some of the Quéenes owne
ships, and partly of the ships of the West parts.
                  But after that it was certainely vnderstood, that the great
Nauy of Spaine was ready to come out from Lisbone, and

that the fame therof was blowne abroad in Christendome to
be inuincible, and so published by bookes in print, the Quéene
and all her Counsel I am sure (whatsoeuer good countenance
they made) were not a little perplexed, as looking certainely
for a daungerous fight vpon the Seas, and after that for a
landing and Inuasion. Whereupon the Lord Admirall was
commaunded to saile with the greatest ships, to the West of
England towardes Spaine to ioyne with Drake, whom he
made Viceadmiral, & to continue in the seas betwixt France
and England to stop the landing of the Nauy of Spaine. And
with the Lord Admirall went in certaine of the Quéens ships,
the Lord Thomas Haward second sonne to the last Duke of
Norfolke,
                     L. Tho. Haward L. Sheffeld. and the Lord Sheffeld, sonne to the Admirals sister,
who is wife to the Quéenes Ambassadour in France, with a
great number of Knights of great liuelode: And at that time
the Lord Henry Seymour was left with a good number of
ships in the narrow Seas, vpon the coast of Flaunders to attend
on the Duke of Parma.
                  
                  Whilest these two Nauies were thus diuided, I confesse to
you that I and others of our part, secretely made full accompt
that none of all these English ships durst abide the sight of the
Armada of Spaine: or if they would abide any fight, yet they
should all be sonke at the first encounter. For such constant opinion
we had conceiued by the reports of the world, that the
greatnes & number of the ships, and the Army of Spaine, being
the chosen vessels of all the Kings Dominions, was so eccessiue
monstrous, beyond all the Nauies that euer had bene
seene in Christendome (not excepting the Armada at Lepanto)
that no power could abide in their way. But how farre deceiued
we were therein, a very short time, euen the first day, did
manifestly, to the great dishonour of Spaine, discouer. For
when the Catholique Armie came to the coast of England,
which in déede the English confesse did séeme farre greater
then they looked for, and that they were astonied with the sight
of them:The fight of the English Nauie with the Spanish. yet the Lord Admiral & Drake, hauing but onely fifty
of the English ships out of the Hauen of Plimmouth, where
the rest remained for a new reuictualling, without tarying for

the rest of the Nauie that was in Plimmouth, they did offer
present fight, & furiously pursued the whole Nauie of Spaine,
being aboue 160. ships: so as the same, with the furious and
continuall shot of the English one whole day, fled without
any returning.The flying away of the Spanish Nauie. And after, the English Nauy being encreased
to an hundred great and smal, renued their fight with terrible
great shot all the whole day, gaining alwayes the wind of the
Spanish Nauy. And as I am sory to remember the particularities,
which the English haue largely written to their owne
prayse: so to speake all in one word, for nine dayes together,
they still forced them to flie, and destroyed, sonke, and
tooke in thrée dayes fight, diuers of the greatest shippes: out of
which, specially out of the principall great ship of Andaluzia,
and out of the Admiranta of Guipusque, and thirdly out of the
principall great Galliasse of Naples great numbers were
brought (beside many moe killed and drowned) to London,
and to sundry other portes of the Realme, to the great dishonour
of Spaine: amongst which prisoners were a great number
of Captaines both for land and sea. And besides that, which
déepely blemisheth the honour of Spaine, and vexeth me at my
heart, to consider the inequalitie of fortune, it is vaunted by
our Aduersaries, that in all the time of these fightes so many
dayes,The Spaniards prisoners say, that Christ shewed himself a Lutheran in this Sommer voiage of the Spanish Nauie. the Spaniards did neuer take, or sink, any English ship
or boate, or breake any mast, or tooke any one man prisoner. A
matter that in déede these Spaniards which are taken do marueile
at greatly, and chafe thereat: so as some of them in their
anguish of minde let not to say, that in all these fightes Christ
shewed himselfe a Lutheran.
                  
                  And though such spéeches be vnaduised, and not to be regarded:
yet surely it is most manifest, that in all this voiage from
the comming of the Nauie out of Lisbon euen to this houre,God shewed no sauour to the Spanishe Nauy from the beginning to the ending.
God did shew no fauour to ours any one day, as he did continually
to these Lutherans: which, percase, may be done for our
good, to correct vs as putting our trust wholy in our worldly
strength, & to the confusion hereafter of the Lutherans, by puffing
them vp, being his enemies, with prosperitie for a time, to
be afterwardes the cause of their ruine. And amongest other

things reported to the dishonour of the Duke of Medina, who,
it is said, was lodged in the bottome of his ship for his safetie,
and to a great touch to the Commanders of the Spanish Nauie,
that they neuer would turne their ships, nor stay them, to
defend any of their owne shippes that were forced to tary behind,
but suffred diuers to perish, as are good witnesses thereof
the thrée great vessels.Don Pedro de Valdez, Captaine Generall of the Armada of Andaluzia. Hugo de Moncada, Generall of the Galliasses of Naples. One wherein Don Pedro de Valdez
was taken: an other Galleon of Guipusque that was spoiled
with fire: and the noble Galliasse wherein Hugo de Moncada
was slaine: of which lacke of care by the Duke of Medina,
these Spaniards that are taken giue very euill report. The
like is said in Zeland by the Spaniards there, that were saued
with Diego de Pimentelli,
                     Diego de Pimentelli Captaine of the Galleon named S. Matthew. though the Galleon wherin he was,
being beaten with the English shot, and not succoured by the
Nauie of Spaine, did there perish in their cōming to Flushing,
and so also did another likewise perish for lacke of succour before
Ostend.
                  
                  And now I must néedes thinke that you are stricken with
some griefe of mind, or rather with some anger towards me, to
heare from me so much of those aduerse things, although they
are too true: and therfore I also imagine you may be disirous,
for your better contentation, to vnderstand what opinions we
that are here haue, being thus frustrate of our expected deliuerie,
by the defeat of this enterprise: whether we do comfort
our selues with a conceit that this Action may be, by any probabilitie,
once againe renued this next yeare, for the recouerie
of our lost hope this yeare, famously spoken of by ye number of
88. and so verified to the losse of al Catholiuqes.A consideration what may be done the next yeare to renew this Action. Wherin surely
for our owne parts, as by secret conference I find with manie
with whom I haue secretely of late upon this vnfortunate
accident conferred, we can not iudge of any likelihood of good
successe for any long time: and if there should any be hoped
for, surely the Sea-forces of the King Catholique, must of
necessitie be more increased, and better also gouerned then
they were this yeare. For this we here doe consider that this
enterprise of Inuasion and Conquest, was alwaies principallie
grounded vpon many probable opinions of the euill state

of the Realme.
                  First of the weaknes of the English Nauie: for so you know 
you were diuers waies this last yeare aduertised from hence,The 3. hopes conceiued against Englād, are nowe all frustrated.
and so also many of vs here did conceiue the same: wherein we
see by all this yeares seruice with these ships, we did all notably
erre.
                  Next, of a supposed euill contentment of a number of people 
in this land to serue the Queene, and her Gouernment against
her enemies.
                  Lastly, and most principally, of a great strong partie that 
would be found here in the fauour of vs for the Catholique religion,
that should take armes against the Queene vpon the
first sight of the Catholique Nauie on the coasts of England.
Of all which opinions, setled in good mens minds in maner of
iudgements, we know that none in the world did more constantly
assure the King thereof then you: which, as the matters
haue euil succeeded, may, I feare, bring you in danger of
his indignatiō, although I know you meant very wel therin.
                  And as these three opinions haue all failed this yeare, so I
assure you, though some of ours on that side ye seas may persist
in their former opinions against the experience lately seen (as
it is likely they may be forced to do, to maintaine them selues
in credit, for continuing their necessary relief from the Pope,
and the King, hauing no other means to keepe them from steruing
or begging) yet because I would not haue you further deceiued
by them, who haue not bene present in the Realme to
see such contrary proofs against all their conceits, as I and others
haue done: I will shew you a great number of manifest
Arguments, though I am sory at my heart to remēber them,
whereby you in your wisedome (if you be not blinded by others)
shall see it most certaine, that these former opinions, for
comfort to be had from hence, will proue the next yeare as
strong against vs, and in some part more strong then they proued
this yeare, if any accompt should be made thereof.
                  First, for the Nauy of England, which hath this yere to the
sight of the world proued to be of great force & value, for those
Seas, and able to ouermatch in their maner of fight, double to

their number, of the great Gallions, Carikes, Galliasses, or Gallies,
it is certaine that it will be greatly increased this next
yeare. For I know, that within these few dayes, bargaines
are already made, & Imprest of money deliuered, and certaine
sent into the Estlands, for great store of all maritime prouisiōs.
And as for the increase of the number of good shippes for theThe Englishe Nauie will be stronger the next yeare.
Quéenes proper vse there is already a great quantitie of timber
ready, and order giuen to fell more in Nouember, and December
next, in the Countries neare both to the Sea, and to
Thames, to build a number of ships of warre, equall to these
whose seruice was séene this yeare to haue ouermatched the
great Armadas & Castles of Spaine & Italy. And furthermore,
to ioyne with the Nauie of England this yeare following, not
onely the Hollanders and Zelanders, but also shippes of Denmarke,
& other partes of Estland, will certainly be had in great
numbers, whereof there was none at all required this yeare
past to ioyne with the Nauie of Englād. Onely certaine Hollanders
& Zelanders offred their seruice (according as they are
bound) in the end of this Sommer,Offer of Hollanders and Zelanders, to ioine with the English Nauie. since the conflict neare Callice,
to ioyne with some of the English Nauie in the narrow
seas, to defend ye issuing of the Duke of Parma out of the ports
of Flāders: & in that seruice at this time there are aboue fortie
and sixe good ships of warre,Iustinian Nassau Admiral of Holland with sixe and fortie ships of warre ioyned to the English Nauie, against the D. of Parma. with the Uiceadmirall Iustinian of
Nassau: a man that agréeth too well with the English Nation,
and is a sworne enemie to all Spaniardes, and Catholiques: &
as it is reported for certaine, there are thréescore more comming
out of North-Holland to the Seas, for the same purpose:
so as it is to be doubted, that this Realme, this next yeare,
will be double as strong as it was this last yeare.
                  As to the second branch of our hope depending vpon opinion
of some great miscontentment of sundry persons against the
Quéene the proofe of the contrary so appeared this yeare,Argumentes to proue no miscontentment of the people towards the Queene. both
of her actions to maintaine the liking of all her people, & of the
generall earnest deuotion shewed to her by all estates, Noble
and meane rich & poore, as I thinke no Prince Christened euer
had greater cause of comfort in her people: which I may iudge
to bréede a pride in her. And to recompence the same she did

most notably shew her selfe in this time, euen when most danger
was threatened, in all her actions towards her people, as
carefull for their weale, and for the safetie of her Realme,
without any speciall or particular prouision, or regard to her
owne person,The prouidēce of the Queene to make her Realme strong. as euer any Prince could do. First, to let her people
vnderstand what care she had to make her Realme strong
against Inuasion, she politikely, yea most carefully, by her
owne frequent directions, caused her whole Realme to be put
in armes, she tooke accompt thereof her selfe by monethly Certificat
from such as were made her Lieutenauntes in euerie
Shire of her Realme, she caused Armour, Powder, Weapon,
to be sent to all Countries, and Ordinance to all Maritime
Countries: There were also sundry Armies described, to defend
euery coast of the Sea: and as I heard it reported by
some that did know the secrets of the Court, was importunate
with her Counsell to leaue no day vnoccupied, to bring these
seruices to effect, and yet she did still continue her Commissioners
in the Low Countries to treat of peace, which surely she
desired to haue obtained, so that she might haue had the same
with certaine conditions. So as to content her people, shee
did both treat and desire peace, and did not in the meane time
neglect to make her Realme strong for defence, if peace could
not be gotten. But in the end, when her demaunds were wholy
refused (whereof we and all Catholiques were most glad)
and that she vnderstood very certainely, that the Armie of
the Duke of Parma should come first to destroy the Citie of
London, she reuoked her Commissioners, approched London
in person, and did lie, as it were, in the Suburbs of the same:
whereby they of the Citie tooke great comfort, hauing daily in
shew and muster of their owne ten thousand men armed and
trained of very able men of the Citie, and in readines thirtie
thousand more, able to fight.
                  She caused also an Armie to be brought to incampe néere
the Sea side,The Queenes being in the Army in Essex, when moste daunger was threatned by the enemies landing. vpon the Riuer of Thames, betwixt the Sea and
the City, twenty miles beneath the City: and after the Army
was come thither, she would not by any aduise be staied, but
for comfort of her people, and to shew her owne magnanimity

of heart (as she said, she would so do though she was a woman)
she went to that Armie lying betwixt the City and the
Sea, vnder the charge of the Earle of Leicester, placing her
selfe betwixt the enemy and her City, and there viewed her
Armie, and passed through it diuers times, lodged in the borders
of it, returned againe, and dined in the Armie: And first,
saw the people as they were, by their Countries, lodged and
quartered in their seuerall campes, which she viewed from
place to place. Afterward, when they were all reduced into
battailes, ready, as it were, to fight with any enemy, she
rode round about them, and did view them curiously, being
accompanied onely but with the Generall, and thrée or foure
others attending on her: But yet to shew her state, I well
marked it, she had the sword carried before her by she Earle of
Ormond.
                  
                  There she was generally saluted with cries, with shoutes,
with all tokens of loue, of obedience, of readinesse and willingnesse
to fight for her,The notable Applause of the people to the Queene for her presence in the Campe. as seldom hath bene seene in a Campe
and army, considering she was a Quéene: and all tended to
shew a maruellous cōcord, in a mutual loue, betwixt a Quéene
and her subiects: and of reuerence, and obedience of Subiects
to a Soueraigne: all which she acquited with very Princely
thanks, and good spéeches. I could enlarge this description
with many moe particularities of mine owne sight, for thither
I went, as many others did: and all that day, wandering from
place to place, I neuer heard any word spoken of her, but in
praising her for her stately person, and Princely behauiour:
and in praying for her life and safety, and cursing of all her
enemies, both Traitours, and all Papists, with earnest desire
to venter their liues for her safety.
                  And besides such particular Acclamations the whole Army
in euery quarter,The singing of Psalmes by the English Army in the Campe. did deuoutly at certaine times sing in her
hearing, in very tunable maner, diuers Psalmes put into
forme of Praiers in praise of almighty God, no waies to be
misliked, which she greatly commended, & with very earnest
spéech thanked God with them. This that I write, you may be
sure, I do not with any comfort, but to giue you these manifest

Argumentes, that neither this Quéene doth discontent her
people, nor her people do shewe any discontentation in any
thing that they be commaunded to do for her seruice, as heretofore
hath bene imagined.An Army prouided for the Queene, beside the Army, readie to withstād the landing of the enemie. She had also an Armie of about
fortie thousand footmen, and of sixe thousand horsemen, vnder
the charge of the Lord Hunsdon Lord Chāberlein, as Lieutenant
of that Army, made ready from the Inland partes of the
Realme, to be about her owne person, without disarming the
maritime Counties: so as many marched out of sondry Countries
towards her, at the very time that she was in the Camp:
some came to the Suburbes & Townes neare London, whom
she remaunded to their Countries, because their Haruest was
at hand, and many of them would not be countermaunded,
but still approched onward on their owne charges (as they
sayd) to sée her person, & to fight with them that boasted to conquere
the Realme. But though the greatest nomber of the said
souldiours were compelled to returne, yet the Captaines, Leaders,
and the principall Knightes and Gentlemen came to the
Court to offer their seruice: & those were gratiously accepted of
her with many thankes, and are now for the more part returned
with a full determination, and firme promise to continue
their Bands in such redines, as vpon a few houres warning
they will assuredly returne with them in good array.
                  Beside these foresaid Argumentes to disproue the opinion
of discontentment of the people, which heretofore hath bene
thought a great furtherance to this honorable action, I will
also remember you some other more notable Actions, to proue
both contentation, and readines, in all the Nobilitie of the
Realme at this time, that were not tyed to abide in their countries
by reason of their offices, as Lieutenantes and Gouernours
there for Martiall seruices. For assoone as it was heard
that the Quéene was come nere London, and that the Armies
were in gathering to come out of the countries,Great power of Horsemen brought by the Nobilitie to attend on the Queenes person. for defence of
all Inuasions, and reportes brought from the sea coasts of the
apparance of the Spanish Nauie: all the Noble men in the
Realme, from East and West, from North and South, excepting
onely such great Lordes as had speciall Gouernementes

in Countries, that might not lawfully be absent from their
charge, and some few that were not able to make forces according
to their desire, came to the Quéene, bringing with them
according to their degrées, and to the vttermost of their powers,
goodly Bands of horsemen, both Launces, light horsemen,
and such other as are termed Carabins or Argeletiers, lodging
their Bands round about London, and maintaining them in
pay at their owne charges all the time, vntill the Nauie of
Spaine was certainly knowen to be passed beyond Scotland.
And of these Noble men many shewed their Bands of their
horsemen, before the Quéene euen in the fields afore her own
gate, to the great marucile of men of good iudgement (as I
heard reported) for that the number of them was so great, and
so well armed, and horsed, as knowing that they were no parcell
of the numbers of horsemen limited in euery Countrie,
and put into Bands with ye Armies described, it was thought
before they were séene, that there had not bene so many spare
horses of such valour in the whole realme, excepting the North
part of England towards Scotland, whose forces consist chiefly
of horsemen.
                  The first that shewed his Bands to the Quéene, was that
Noble,The Viscount Mountagues shewe of horsemen was the first. vertuous, honorable man, the Viscount Mountague,
who, howsoeuer men do iudge of him for opinion in Religion,
yet to tell you the truth, he is reported alwaes to haue professed,
as now also at this time he did professe and protest solemnely,
both to the Quéene, and to all her Court, in open Assemblies,
that he now came, though he was very sickly, and in
age, with a full resolution to liue and die in defence of the
Quéene, and of his countrie, against all Inuaders, whether it
were Pope, King or Potentate whatsoeuer, and in that quarell
he would hazard his life, his children, his lands and goods.
And to shew his minde agréeably thereto, he came personally
himself before the Quéene, with his Band of horsemen being
almost two hundred: the same being led by his owne sonnes,
and with them a yong child, very comely seated on horseback,
being the heire of his house, that is, the eldest sonne to his son
& heire: a matter much noted of many, whom I heard to commend

the same: to sée a grandfather, father, and sonne, at one
time on horsebacke afore a Quéene for her seruice, though in
truth I was sory to sée our Aduersaries so greatly pleased
therewith. But I cannot conceale it from your Lordships
knowledge, because I thinke this Noble man is knowen vnto
you, hauing bene vsed as an Ambassadour to the King Catholique
many yeares past by this Quéene (as I haue heard) to
require confirmation of the treaties of amitie, betwixt both
their Fathers. And of this Noble mans conditions, I thinke
there be some others, of whom there is no accompt to be made
that they will giue sauour to any attempt against the Quéene
or to any Inuasion of the Realme.
                  There were also many at the same time that made shewes
of great numbers of seruiceable horses,A number of great Lordes shewed their horsemen. whereof though it be
no comfort to you to heare▪ yet is it good that you be not abused
for lacke of knowledge, how the present state is here: that you
may better iudge hereafter what may be done to recouer this
late losse and dishonour.Earle of Lincolne.
                     Lord Windesore. At this time the Earle of Lincolne,
and the Lord Windesore, with some Knights and Gentlemen
with them shewed their Bands, as the Lord Montague had
done: and after them,Lord Chancelour. the Lord Chancelour shewed goodly
Bands of horsemen and footmen at his owne house, very manie
and strong. And within one or two daies after the Earle
of Warwicke,
                     Earle of Warwicke. the Lord Burghley Lord Treasurer,Lord Treasurer the Lord
Compton,
                     L. Compton. and in the end of the day the Earle of Leycester,
                     Earle of Leycester. and
the Lord Rich,
                     Lord Rich. besides sundry Knights of the Realme,Sir Walter Mildmay. shewed
euery of them seuerall strong Bands of horsemen,Sir Henry Cromwell, to the great
liking of the Quéene,Sir 
                           〈◊◊〉
                        
                      and of all the people that were there,Earle of Essex with a great Band of horsemen and footemen afore the Queene at S. Iames. being
many thousands. And within two daies after that, the
Earle of Essex being Master of the Quéenes horse, with certaine
principall Gentlemen his seruants friends and followers,
shewed afore the Quéene aboue thrée hundred horses of al
seruice, and a great number of Carabins, and a faire Band of
footmen all Musketiers.
                  This shew excéeded in number any other particular Band,
and the Earle himselfe with a great number of Launces, horsed
and armed, did run very many courses, and specially with

the Earle of Cumberland (as they cal it) the Course of the field
which I had neuer séene before:Course of the field. and did also him selfe, and his
company Tourney on horsebacke a very long time,Tourney. and caused
also his Carabines, and his footemen to make many skirmishes
there, to the great liking of the Quéene, and of the multitude
of people, which were many thousands. Amongst whom
I heard many vehement spéeches against all English Papists,
calling them all Traitors, wishing also that the Spaniards,
had bene there in that field with treble the number, to make
proofe of the value of English men: all which I heard to my
great griefe, with many curses against all their countrimen,
saying, that they as arrant Traitors to their natiue countrie,
had villanously sold, as farre as in them did lie, the libertie of
their country to Spaniards, and other Papists. It behoued me
not there to haue contraried any of them, for surely if I had,
their rancour was so stirred vp, by the comfort of these faire
shewes of horsemen, as they would there in the field in their
rage haue killed me, and cut me in a thousand péeces.
                  Besides these Lords aboue named, there were brought to
the towne, other faire Bandes by the Earle of Worcester,
                     Earle of Worcester. the
Earle of Hertford,
                     Earle of Hertford. the Lord Audeley,
                     Lord Audeley. Lord Morley,
                     Lord Morley. Lord
Dacres,
                     L. Dacres. Lord Lomeley,
                     L. Lomeley. Lord Mountioy,
                     L. Mountioy. Lord Sturton,
                     L. Sturton. Lord
Darcy,
                     L. Darcy. Lord Sands,
                     L. Sands. Lord Mordant,
                     L. Mordant. and by euery one that
were of the priuie Counsell: so as by estimation, there were
about London at that time, aboue fiue thousand horses readie
to serue the Quéene, besides all the horsemen that were raised
in all other Countries for the Armies, and the Sea coasts.
And besides these, I heard in a very good place, where I
was silent, that there was by accompt twise as many in readinesse,
with the Noble men that were absent, attending on
their charges in their seuerall Lieutenancies. As the Marques
of Winchester,
                     Marques of Winchester. one counted to be the strongest man of his own
furniture for Horse & Armour, who is Lieutenant of Hampshire,
with the Earle of Sussex
                     Earle of Sussex. Captaine of Portemouth,
and Lieutenant also of Dorcetshire. Next to him is in
accompt the Earle of Shrowsbury
                     Erle of Shrowsbury. Earle Marshal of England
Lieutenent of a great number of Countries, and of great

power of his owne, both for horsemen and footmen, beside the
power of the Lord Talbot
                     L. Talbot. his sonne. The Earle of Darby
                     Earle of Darby also,
though he was in Flaunders, from whence he came lately, yet
his sonne the Lord Strange,
                     L. Strange. Lieutenent of Lancashire and
Cheshire in his fathers absence, is said to haue raised a great
power of horsemen. And to shew the populer affection to this
Earle in his Countrey, I heard it for certaine reported, that
when the Earle continued longer in Flanders then they liked,
and doubting of his returne, for that they supposed that the
Duke of Parma would stay him, and the other Commissioners
there, the people of his Countrie in a generalitie did amongst
themselues determine, that the Lord Strange the Erles sonne,
and all the manhood of Lancashire and Cheshire would goe ouer
the Seas and fetch the Earle home. A matter for no purpose
to be spoken of, but to note the force of the loue which the
people doe beare to the Earle, who with his sonne is firmely
bent against the Pope.
                  The Earle of Bath
                     Earle of Bath. also Lieutenant of Deuonshire, had as
is said, great forces of his owne readie to haue impeached the
landing of any strangers in Deuonshire.
                     Earle of Pembrokes noble offer. The Earle of Pembroke
also being Lieutenant of Somersetshire and Wiltshire,
and Lord President of all Wales, was ready to haue come to
the Quéene with thrée hundred horsemen, and fiue hundred
footmen all of his owne retinue, leauing all the Countries vnder
his charge fully furnished.
                  I omit here to speake of the Bands of horsemen, belonging
to the Earles of Northumberland
                     Earle of Northumberland. and Cumberland,
                     Earle of Cumberland. which
though they were ready to haue bene shewed at the same time:
yet the Earles hearing of the Spanish Armie approching,
went voluntarily to the Sea side in all hast, and came to the
Quéenes Nauie before the fight afore Callice. Where they
being in seuerall ships of the Quéenes, did with their owne
persons valiant seruices against the Kings Armada. And to
shew the great readines in a generalitie of sundrie others at
the same time, to aduenture their liues in the said seruice,
there went to the Seas at the same time diuers Gentlemen of
good reputation, who voluntarily without any charge, & without

knowledge of the Quéene, put themselues into the Quéens
Nauy in sundry ships, wherein they serued at the fight afore
Callice: of which number being very great, I remember that
the names of some of them were these:Master Henry Brooke. Master Henry Brooke
sonne & heire to the Lord Cobham,
                     Sir. Tho. Cecil. Sir Thomas Cecil sonne
and heire to the Lord Treasurer,Sir Wil. Hatton Sir William Hatton heire
to the Lord Chancellour Sir Horatio Pallauicino a Knight of
Genua,
                     Sir Horatio Pallauicino. Master Robert Carie sonne to the Lord Hunsdon,
                     M. Robert Carie. Sir
Charles Blunt,
                     Sir Charles Blunt. brother to the Lord Mountioy.
                     M. Thomas Gerard. But much
speach is of two Gentlemen of the Court that went to the Nauie
at the same time,M. Wil. Heruie. whose names are Thomas Gerard and
William Heruie, to me not knowen, but now here about London
spoken of with great fame. These two aduentured out of
ship boate, to scale the great Galliasse wherein Moncada was,
and entred the same only with their Rapiers: a matter commonly
spoken, that neuer the like was hazarded afore, considering
the height of the Galliasse compared to a ship boate.
                  And yet to make it more manifest, how earnest all sorts of
Noble men, and Gentlemen, were to aduenture their liues in
this seruice, it is reported that the Earle of Oxford,
                     Earle of Oxford. who is one
of the most auncient Earles of this land, went also to the Sea
to serue in the Quéenes Army. There went also for the same
purpose, a second sonne of the Lord Treasurer, called as I can
remember,M. Robert Cecil. 
                     Robert Cecil:
                     L. Dudley. there went also about that time to
the Seas,Sir Walter Ralegh. the Lord Dudley an ancient Baron of the Realme,
and Sir Walter Ralegh a Gentleman of the Queenes priuie
Chamber, and in his company a great number of young Gentlemen,
amongst whom I remember the names of the heire of
Sir Thomas Cecil,
                     M. Wil. Cecil. called William Cecil,
                     M. Edward Darcy. of Edward Darcy,
                     M. Arthure Gorge. 
                     Arthure Gorge, and such others: with the rehearsall of whom
I do not comfort my selfe, but only to shew you, how farre we
haue bene deceiued to thinke that we should haue had a partie
here for vs, when as we sée both by land and Sea, all sorts
of men were so readie of their owne charges, without either
commandement, or entertainement, to aduenture their liues
in defence of the Quéene and the Realme.
                  And for the Earle of Huntingtons forces,Earle of Huntington. being Lieutenant

Generall in the North, it is reported, that he hath put in readines
for an Armie in Yorkshire, and other Countries commonly
limited to serue against Scotland, to the number of fortie
thousand well armed footemen, and neare hand ten thousand
horsemen, to come to him if any occasion of Inuasion should
be in the North partes: to whom are ioyned with their forces
thrée Lordes in the North▪ the Lord Scroop,
                     L. Scroope. 
                     Lord Darcy,
                     L. Darcy. and
Lord Euers.
                     L. Euers.
                  
                  There are also diuers other Lordes that are Lieutenants
of Countries, that haue in readinesse of their proper charges
good numbers of horsemen. As the Earle of Kent,
                     Earle of Kent Lieutenant
of Bedfordshire the L. Hunsdon Lord Chamberlaine,L. Hunsdon. Lieutenant
of Norfolk and Suffolk: the Lord Cobham
                     L. Cobham. Lieutenant of
Kent:
                     L. Grave. the Lord Gray of Buckinghamshire: the Lord North
                     L. North. of
Cambridgeshire: Lord Chandos
                     L. Chandos. of Glocestershire: Lord S.
Iohn
                     L. Saint Iohn. of Huntingtonshire: Lord Buckhurst
                     L. Buckhurst. of Sussex: and so by
this particuler recital not vnméet for your knowledge, it is to
be noted what disposition the Nobilitie of the Realme had at
this time to haue withstood all Inuasion. And if percase you
shall peruse your ordinary Catalogue of the grrat Lordes of
the Realme, you shal find that these are the substance of all the
great Lords,Earle of Rutland. sauing thrée young Earles within age,Earle of Southhampton. 
                     Rutland,
                     Earle of Bedford. 
                     Southhampton, and Bedford: all thrée brought vp in peruerse
religion. And so remaineth to be spoken of, the Earle of Arundel,
who is in the Tower for attempting to haue fled out of the
Realme, by prouocation of him that now is Cardinall Allen:
who, howsoeuer he may be affected to the Catholique religion:
yet I heare most certainly that he offereth his life in defence of
the Quéene against all the world.
                  And where accompt was made to haue a partie in this
Realme, which by these former relations appeare could
not be possible, the whole Nobilitie being assured to the
Quéene, and the force of the people not violently bent that
way: In this very time was offered to the Quéene as great
a partie for her, to come to her seruice, and defence of the
Realme, as out of all Christendome, she could not haue to all
respects a stronger. Which was the King of Scots, who hearing

of the intended Inuasion of the Realme,Offer of the K. of Scots to the Queen of England. sent a Gentlemā
to the Quéene, with his letter, as I credibly heard, to offer
her all the power that he had to defend her & her Realme: and
if she so would, he would come in his owne person, and hazard
his owne life, to defend this Realme against all Inuaders for
Religion, or any other pretence whatsoeuer. So by this you
may sée, what accompt may be made of any vayne promises,
made in the name of this King. And because you shall perceiue
that I haue good meanes to haue intelligence of any other forces
of the Realme for defence thereof,Bands of horsemen and footmē erected by the Bishops. it is most certaine as I
heare, and I haue séene a List or Rol of a great number both of
horsemen and footmen, which the Bishops of the Realme haue
of their owne charges, with the cōtribution of the Clergy, raised
vp in Bandes of horsemen and footmen, which are to be led
by Noble Gentlemen at the Quéenes nomination: and these
Bandes must be vaynely termed Milites Sacri.
                  
                  As to the last point of the thrée foundations of the principal
hope conceiued,The third and last hope which the Catholiques had of a partie in the realme was all frustrate. whereupon the Inuasion was chiefly grounded
and taken in hand, which was most certainly and generally
beléeued, that there should be found here in the Realme a
strong partie of Catholiques, against the Quéene to ioyne and
assist the Inuaders, vpō the appearing of the Spanish Nauie:
by my former relations of the generall great & feruent loue
of the people towardes the Quéene, and of the great offers of
seruice now made by the whole Nobilitie of the Realme, this
their foundation may appeare to haue bene wrong laied, onely
by imaginations, as it were vpon a quick sand or rather as
flying in the aire. And yet it appeareth very truely that no
small accompt was made hereof by the King of Spaine, and
by his principall Ministers: for there is nothing at this present
more vniuersally, with one lamentable voyce spoken of,
by all the multitude of the Spaniardes,The Spanishe prisoners condemne the K. purpose, as being abused, by the exiled Catholiques, whō the Spaniards call traitors to their countrey. now here prisoners,
yea by the chiefest of them, then that they now euidently sée,
that the King their Maister was with such informatiōs greatly
abused, yea rather betrayed, For they say there was no mā
of value in all this Army, but he heard it constantly affirmed,
and so deliuered for comfort of all that serued therein, before

they were shipped, that they should not be afrayed of any resistance
to land in England, for that there was good assurance
geuen to the King, that they should finde a strong Armie of
Catholiques ready in their fauour, assoone as euer their Nauie
should be séene vpon the Sea coast,No possibilitie to Inuade and conquere a realme, without fauour of a partie inward. & so they all here say they
were incouraged to come to this iourney: otherwise, many of
them sweare they would neuer haue come on shipbord: so vnlikely,
they say, it was and against all reason, to Inuade a
Realme, with opinion to conquere it, without both some
title of right, and a partie also: but specially without a good
sure partie.
                  And therefore now finding this report very false, many of
these prisoners do by name curse you,The Spanishe prisoners condemne the enterprise and course of Don Bernardin of Mendoza. as being the Kinges
Ambassadour: as him, they say, who vpon the opinion of the
knowledge which you had gotten in England, was therein
more credited then any other, and had these many yeares
together tempted the King their Maister, vpon hope, and other
such like perswasions, to attempt such a matter as this was:
being vtterly in all wisedome to haue bene condemned, without
some certaintie of this latter part, specially to haue had a
strong partie here. They also curse all such Englishmen, as
haue fled out of this Countrie, whom they spare not to call arrant
Traitors, for offring the sale of their Countrie to the
Pope and the King of Spaine. And these prisoners adde also,
that they were borne in hand, that this Countrie was so
open to march in, and so weake to withstand any force, and
the people so miserable, as they thought the Conquest thereof
had bene of no more difficulty then the ouercomming of a
nomber of naked Indians was at the beginning of the Conquest
thereof by King Ferdinand.
                  
                  And now for strength of this countrie and people: many of
these prisoners hauing bene brought from the Sea coastes hether
to London, whereby they haue obserued the countrie and
the people, doe speake marueilously thereof, counting the same
inuincible, otherwise then by treason of some great partie
within the Realme. But whether all these spéeches which are
commonly reported of them procéede from their hartes, or that

they speake thus to please the English, because they are well
vsed by them, who also are easily deceiued with flattery, I
know not: but sure I am they do thus speake dayly, with outward
shewe of great passions against such as haue bene perswaders
to the King for this iourney. Diuers of them also
which are of good iudgemēt, & haue heard of such of the English
banished men as haue bene in Spaine, & haue knowen some
of them there (as of long time,Sir Frācis Englefield. 
                     Sir Francis Englefield, & of late,Lord Paget. the Lord Paget & his brother) haue curiously inquired, of what
power they were & credit here, to haue a partie. They also inquired
of the Earle of Westmerland:
                     Earle of Westmerland. although of him they confesse
he is a man but of small gouernement. But our Aduersaries
here haue so abased these & all the rest, to haue bene of no
credit to cary any numbers of men but by the Quéenes authoritie,
when they were at their best: as the prisoners wonder
how the king could be so deceiued to giue them pentions otherwise
then for charitie, because of their religion. But they confesse
they haue often heard in Spaine, how the King was once
notably deceiued,Thomas Stukleyes abusing of the King of Spaine and the Pope, newly remēbred by the Spaniardes. when one Thomas Stukeley a priuat Englishman,
who fled out of Ireland for debt & other lewd Actions
into Spaine, not being worth one peny, his debts being paied,
& but the second sonne of a meane Gentleman, pretended, and
was beléeued in Spaine (by so intitling of him selfe) to be a
Duke, a Marquis, and an Earle of Ireland, and so was a long
time enterteined, as a man that could do great seruice against
the Quéene of England: vntill at length the King vnderstood
his falshood, and banished him out of Spaine. And after repairing
to Rome, was by the Pope also mainteined for a
time, vntill he was discouered euen by some good Catholiques,
that could not endure the Popes holines to be so grossely mocked:
of whom some of the prisoners vsing mery spéeches, how
both the Emperour Charles and afterward this King, and the
Pope, were so notably deceiued by this Stukeley, do conclude
merely, that they thinke some of these English that haue thus
abused the King, haue followed Stukeleys steppes. And in very
truth, I and many others haue bene very often ashamed to
heare so brode spéeches, of the King, and of the Pope, yea of

the Emperour Charles, whom such a companion as Stukeley
was, could so notably deceiue: and it was the more to be marueiled,
how he could deceiue the King Catholique, considering
he was knowen to many of his Counsell, at the Kings being
in England, to haue bene but a vaunting beggar, and a Ruffian,
and afterwards, a Pirat against the Spaniards.
                  Now my Lord Ambassadour,A conclusiō by the writer, to perswade an other course, not by violence. by these my large relations of
the things euil past, and of the opinions of such as I haue lately
dealt withall, with mine owne conceit also, which I doe not
vainely imagine, your Lordship may sée in the first part, our
present calamitie, and miserable estate: in the second part, the
state of this Quéene, her Realme, her people, their mindes,
their strength, so far contrary to the expectation of the Popes
holines, the King Catholique, and specially of you (my Lord)
and all others that haue bene in hand these many yeares with
this Actiō, as I know not what course shal, or may be thought
méete to take, séeing it is séene by experience, that by force, our
cause cannot be reléeued, Neither will any change amend the
matter, when this Quéene shall end her daies, as all Princes
are mortall. For both the vniuersalitie of the people through
the Realme, are so firmely and desperately bent against our
religion, as nothing can preuaile against their vnited forces:
and whosoeuer shall by right sucéede to this Crowne after
the Quéene (who is likely to liue as long as any King in Christendome)
if the Crowne should come to the King of Scots,No hope for furtherance of the Popes authoritie by any now liuing that may succeede the Queene in the liue Royall. or
to any other of the blood Royall, as there are very many
within this Realme descended both of the Royall houses of
York, and Lancaster, there is no accompt to be made, but euery
one of them, that now liue at this day, are knowen to be as
vehemently disposed to withstand the authoritie of the Pope,
as any of the most earnest Protestant or Heretique in the
world. So as to conclude, after all circumstances well considered,
for the present I know no other way,A Conclusion what is best, to maintaine the Catholike Religion in England. but to commit
the cause to Almightie God, and to all the Saints in heauen,
without continuall prayers: and in earth to the holy Counsels
of the Pope, and his Cardinals, with our supplications to
reléeue the afflicted number of our exiled brethren, and to send

into the Realme discrete, holy, and learned men, that may only
in secrete maner, without intermedling in matters of estate,
by teaching vs, confirme vs in our faith, and gaine with
charitable instruction, others that are not rooted in heresie.
                  And for reliefe of such as are forced to pay yearely great
sommes of money out of their reuenue, because they forbeare
to come to the Church,A tolleration from the Pope for the Recusants in England. it were to be charitably considered, whether
there might not be some dispensation from the Popes holines
for some fewe yeares, to tollerate their comming to the
Church, without changing of their faith: considering a great
number do stand therein, not for any thing (as they say) vsed
in this Church, that is directly contrary to Gods law, but for
that the Rites and praiers (though they are collected out of the
body of the Scripture) are not allowed by the Catholique
Church, and the head thereof, which is the Popes holines: and
for that cause iustly, al true Catholiques, accompt this Church
to be schismaticall. By which remedie of tolleration, a great
number of such as will be perpetually Catholiques, might enioy
their liuings and libertie: and in proces of time, the Catholique
religion (by Gods goodnesse) might with more suretie
be increased, to the honour of God, then euer it can be by
any force whatsoeuer. For so did all Christian religion at the
first begin, and spread it selfe ouer the world: not by force, but
only by teaching, and example of holines in the teachers, against
all humane forces. And so I will end my long Letters,
with the sentence which King Dauid vsed foure times in one
of his Psalmes. Et clamauerunt ad Dominum in tribulatione eorum
& de angustia eorum liberauit eos: And so must we make
that for our foundation to lay our hope vpon, for all other
hopes are vaine and false.
                  
                     At London the of August. 1588.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                  AFter that I had made an end of this my letter, which I
found by perusall thereof to haue bene at more length,
then I looked for, although the matters therein conteined did
draw me therto, and that I had made choice of a friend of mine
who had more knowledge in the French tong, then I, to turne
the same into French: my mishap was, that when he had done
some part thereof, he fell sicke of a burning feuer, whereby my
letter remained with him vpon hope of recouery for tenne or
twelue daies: and séeing no hope thereof, I entreated another
very trustie & a sound Catholique hauing perfect knowledge
in the French tong, who tooke vpon him to put it into French,
wherein was also longer time spent: so as my letter being
written in the midst of August, I am forced to end it in September.
And thereupon I thought good, whiles my former letter
was in translating, to adde some things happened in the
meanetime méet for your knowledge.
                  About the seuenth of August, the Lord Admirall returned
with the Nauie, hauing followed the Spanish Nauie (as they
reported) as farre as the 55. degrée Northwards: the Spanish
Nauie taking a course either to the furthest partes of
Norwey, or to the Orcades beyond Scotland: which if they did,
then it was here iudged that they would goe about Scotland
and Ireland: but if they should go to Norwey, then it might
be, that if they could recouer prouisions of mastes, whereof
the English Nauy had made great spoile, they might returne.
But I for my part wished them a prosperous winde to passe
home about Ireland, considering I despaired of their returne
for many respects, both of their wants, which could not be furnished
in Norwey, and of the lacke of the Duke of Parmas abilitie
to bring his Armie on the Sea, for want of Mariners.
Neuertheles, vpon knowledge from Scotland that they were
beyond the Orcades,
                     Order taken by the K. of Scots in fauour of the English. and that the King of Scots had giuen
strict commandement vpon all the sea coastes that the Spaniardes
should not be suffered to land in any part, but that the
English might land and be reléeued of any wants: order
was giuen to discharge all the Nauie, sauing twentie ships
that were vnder the Lord Henry Seymours charge, to attend

Spaniardes. Upon these shewes great reioycing followed:
And as in Iune and Iuly past,Daily prayers. all Churches were filled daily
with people exercised with praiers, and shewes of repentance,
and petitions to God for defence against their enemies: and in
many Churches continually thrice in the wéeke exercises of
prayers, Sermons, & fastings all the day long from morning
to euening, with great admiration to sée such generall deuotion
(which I and others did iudge to procéede more of feare
then of deuotion) so now since the English Nauy is returned,
and the Spanish Nauie defeated, and intelligence brought of
the disorders in Flaunders: of the discentions betwixt the
Spaniards, and the other souldiers: of the contempt of the
Duke of Parma by the Spaniards, being thereto maintained
by a Duke called the Duke of Pastraw, the King Catholiques
bastard: and of the departure and running away of the
Dukes Mariners, here is a like cōcourse of the people to Sermons
in all Churches: wherein is remembred the great goodnes
of God towards England,Publike praiers and giuing of thankes. by the deliuery therof from the
threatned Conquest, & praiers also publikely to giue thankes
to God for the same.
                  
                     At London this of September. 1588.
                     
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            The Printer to the Reader.
            
               
                  
                     ALthough it be well known, that neither the first writer
of these Letters nowe by me printed, nor yet the
Spaniard Don Bernardin to whome they are directed,
had any desire to heare of any good successe to
the state of England: as may appeare in the writer, by shewing
himselfe grieued, to make any good report of England, other
then of meere necessitie he was vrged: and in Don Bernardin,
who was so impudent, or at the least, so blindly rash, as to
disperse in print, both in French, Italian, and Spanish, most false
reports of a victorie had by the Spaniards, euen when the victorie
was notable on the part of England, and the Spanish vanquished:
yet whilest I was occupied in the printing hereof, a good
time after the letters were sent into Fraunce, there came to this
Citie certaine knowledge, to all our great comfort, of sundrie
happie Accidents, to the diminution of our mortall enemies in
their famous Fleete, that was driuen out of our seas about the
stla of Iuly, towards the farthermost North partes of Scotland.
Wherfore I haue thought it not amisse to ioine the same to this
Lettre of Don Bernardin, that he may beware, not to be so hastie
of himselfe, nor yet to permit one Capella, who is his common
sower of reports, to write these false things for truthes.
                  The particularities wherof are these. The Fleete was by tempest
driuen beyond the Isles of Orknay, about the first of August,
which is now more then sixe weekes past, the place being
aboue three score degrees from the North Pole: an vnaccustomed
place for the yong Gallants of Spaine, that neuer had felt
stormes on the sea, or cold weather in August. And about those
North Islands their mariners and souldiers died daily by multiutdes:
as by their bodies cast on land, did appeare. And after
twentie dayes or more, hauing spent their time in miseries, they
being desirous to returne home to Spaine, sayled very farre
Southwestward into the Ocean to recouer Spaine. But the Almightie
God, who alwayes auengeth the cause of his afflicted
people which put their confidence in him, and bringeth downe
his enemies that exalt themselues with pride to the heauens, ordred

the winds, to be so violently contrarious to this proud
Nauie, as it was with force disseuered, on the high seas West
vpon Ireland: and so a great number of them, driuen into sundrie
dangerous bayes, and vpon rockes, all along the West, and
North parts of Ireland, in sundrie places distant aboue an hundred
miles asunder, & there cast away: some sonke, some broken,
some runne on sands, some burned by the Spaniards themselues.
                  As in the North part of Ireland towardes Scotland, betwixt
the two riuers of Loughfoile and Lough Svvilley, nine were
driuen to land, and many of them broken, and the Spaniardes
forced to come to land for succour amongst the wilde Irish.
                  In another place, twentie miles Southwest from thence, in a
Bay called Calbeggy, three other ships driuen also vpon rockes.
In another place Southward, being a Bay, called the Borreys,
twentie miles North from Gallowey, belonging to the Erle of
Ormond, one speciall great ship of a thousand tonne, with fiftie
brasse peeces, and foure Canons was sonke, and all the people
drowned sauing sixteene: who by their apparell, as it is aduertised
out of Ireland, seeme to be persons of great estimation.
                  Then to come more to the Sowthward, thirty miles vppon
the coasts of Thomond, North from the riuer of Shennan, two
or three mo perished, whereof one was burned by the Spaniards
them selues, and so driuen to the shore: an other was of S.
Sebastians, wherein were three hundred men, who were also all
drowned▪ sauing three score. A third ship with all her lading
was cast away at a place called Breckan.
                  
                  In another place afore Sir Tirlogh Obrynes house, there was
also another great ship lost, supposed to be a Galliasse. These
losses aboue mētioned, were betwixt the fift and tenth of September,
as was aduertised from sundrie places out of Ireland: so
as by accompt, from the one and twentieth of Iuly, when this
Nauie was first beaten with the Nauie of England, vntill the
tenth of September, being the space of seuen weekes, and more,
it is most likely that the sayde Nauie had neuer good day, nor
night.
                  Of the rest of the Nauie, report is also made that many of
them haue bene seene, lying of and on, vpon the coast of Ireland,

tossed with the winds, in such sort as it is also doubted, that
many of them shall hardly recouer Spaine, if they be so weakened
with lacke of victuals and mariners, as part of their companies
that are left on land do lamentably report. These accidents
I thought good to adde to the printed Copies of the letters of
Don Bernardin: that he may see, how God doth fauour the iust
cause of our gracious Queene, in shewing his anger towardes
these proud boasting enemies of Christian peace: as the whole
world, from Rome to the vttermost parts of Christendome may
see, that she and hir Realme, professing the Gospell of his
sonne Christ, are kept and defended, as the words of the Psalme
are, Vnder the shadovve of his vvings from the face of the vvicked,
that sought to afflict her, & compasse her round about to take avvay
her soule: which, I doubt not, by thankfulnesse yeelded
by her Maiestie and her whole Realme, will
alwayes continewe.

OVT OF IRELAND,
CONCERNING THE LOSSES HAPPEned
to the Spanish armie vpon the West costes of Irelande, in
their voyage intended from the Northerne Isles beyond
Scotland, towardes Spaine.
            
               VPon Saterday the vii. of September,The seuenth of September. the barke
which was in peril of wrack in the bay of Trayly,
of betwéene fortie and fiftie tonne, did render
them selues, in which there were xxiiii. men,
whereof two were the Dukes owne seruaunts
and two litle boyes.
            On Tuesday the tenth of this September, there was a Frigat
cast of as it séemeth by this Nauy, which, as Sir William
Herbert saith, wrecked vpon the coast of Desmond.
            
            On the same Tuesday there wrecked in the sound of the
Bleskeys,
               A place neere to Smerwike where the Spaniards were defeated by the Lord Gray. a ship called our Ladie of Rosary, of one thousande
tonne. In this shippe was drowned the Prince of Ascule, the
Kings base sonne, one Don Pedro, Don Diego, and Don Francisco
with seuen other Gentlemen of accompt, that accompanied
the Prince.Michael Oquē
                  do was general of the squadrō of xiiii. ships of Guipusque. There was drowned in her also Michael Oquendo
a principal sea man chief gouernour of the ship: Villa
Franca of S. Sebastians, Captain of the same ship: Matuta, Captaine
of the Infanterie of that ship: Captaine Suwares a Portingall,
Garrionerie, Lopecho de la Vega, Montenese, and one
Francisco Castilliā, Captains, one Iohn Rise an Irish Captain,
Francis Roch an Irish man & about fiue hūdred persons,Fiue hundred drownd, wherof were a hundred gentlemē, and one onely saued of the whole number. wherof
one hundred were Gentlemen, but not of that reckoning as
the former were, and onely one Iohn Anthonio de Monona a
Genuan being the Pilotes sonne of that ship, saued.
            The same Tuesday it wad aduertised to the Uicepresident

of Mounster, that there were lost vpon the coast of Thomond
two great ships out of which there were drowned about seuen
hundred persons,Seuen hundred drowned, and one hundred takē prisoners. & taken prisoners about one hundred & fiftie.
            About that Tuesday also, as appeareth by a letter writtē to
Stephan White of Limmerik the twelfth of this September,
there was cast vpon the sandes of Ballicrahihy a ship of nine
hundred tonnes,Ballicrahihy. Thirteene gentlemen taken. thirtéene of the Gentlemen of that ship, as he
writeth are taken, and so writeth that he heard the rest of that
ship being aboue foure hundred haue sought for their defence,Foure hundred haue sought to intrench themselues.
being much distressed, to intrench themselues.
            He writeth also of another ship which was cast away at the
Isle of Clere in Irrise,
               Seuēty & eight were drowned and slaine. Threescore taken. and lxxviij. of the men of that ship are
drowned and slaine.
            He writeth also that there was about the same time another
great ship cast away in Tireawley, & that there are thrée Noble
men, a Bishop, and a Frier, and lxix. other men taken by
William Brook of Ardnerie, and all the residue of that ship are
slaine and drowned, in somuch as he writeth that one Melaghlin
Mac Cab, a Galloglasse killed fourescore of them with his
Galloglasse axe.Melaghlin Mac Cab slue foure score of them. Wednesday the xi. of September, seuen of
those ships that then remained within the Shenan departed out
of that Rode with an Easterly winde,A Spanish ship of a thousande tuns burnt by the Spaniards. and before their going
foorth they set on fire one other very great ship of their company,
which was one thousand tonnes at least.
            It was enformed from the Uicepresident at Cork, vpon this
seuentéenth of September last,Two other ships lost. that two other great ships of
that Fléete should be lost vpon the coastes of Connaught.
            
            The Admirall called Iohn Martin de Ricalde came into the
sound of Bleskeys
               Ricaldes the Admiral in the sound of Bleskey. with one other great ship and a barke about
the vi. day of this Septēber, & remaineth there with one other
ship of foure hundred tonnes, & a bark which came in since that
time, if they be not dispersed or lost by the great tempest that
was the xvii. and xviii. of this moneth: for the state of the Admirall
at his comming in was thus, the ship had bene shot thorough
xiiii. or xv. times, her maine mast was so beatē with shot
as she durst not beare her full saile, and now not lx. mariners
left in her, and many of them so sicke that they lye downe, and

the residue so weake, that they were not able to do any good
seruice, and there is daily cast ouer the boord out of that ship
fiue or sixe of the company.
            After this vvas printed thus farre, as euery day bringeth more certaintie
in particulars of the losse of the Spaniardes in Irelande,
these reportes vvhich follovve came from Ireland, being the examinations
of seuer all persons there taken and saued.
            
               IOHN ANTHONIO DE MONONA AN
Italian, sonne to Francisco de Monona Pilot of the ship
called Sancta Marie de la Rose, of a thousand tonnes
cast away in the sound of Bleskey.
11. September. 1588.
               
               EXamined the xi. of September saith, that he and the rest
parted from the English Fléete, as he thinketh, about the
coast of Scotland, and at that time they wanted of their whole
Fléete foure Gallies, seuen ships, & one Galliasse which was
the Captaine Galliasse, and there were then dead by fight & by
sicknes viii.Eight thousand Spaniards lost by fight & sicknesse. thousand men at the least. Where he left ye Duke
he knoweth not, but it was in the North Seas about eightéene
daies sithence, he saw then no land, and therefore can name no
place, but they seuered by tempest, the Duke kept his course to
the sea: we drew towards land to finde Cape Clere, so did diuers
other ships, which he thinkes to amount to the number of
forty ships: with the Duke there went fiue and twenty ships.
               Hither he came round about Scotland, he thinkes the Duke
is by this time nere Spaine, the Dukes desire was, after his
stay before Callice, to go to Flanders, but by reason of the
contrariety of the winds, the shallownesse of the water (his
ships being great) he could not arriue there.
               Besides the ships before mentioned, he remembreth that
two ships were sonke vpon the coast of Scotland,Two ships sonke. by reason
of shottes receiued from the English ships, the one called
S. Matthew of fiue hundred tonnes, wherein were drowned
foure hundred and fifty men, the other ship a Biskey of S.
Sebastian of foure hundred tonnes, wherein were drowned

thrée hundred and fiftie men, and the ship wherein he was called
S. Marie Rose, of one thousand tonnes, wherein of fiue
hundred there escaped but himselfe, in which ship of principall
men there were drowned, these principall men following.
The Prince of Ascule base sonne to the King of Spaine, Captaine
Matuta,
                  A ship of 1000. tonne sonke & of 500. persons but one saued. Captaine Conualle a Portingall, Rupecho de
la Vego of Castill, Suryuero of Castill, Montanese of Castill,
Villa Franca of S. Sebastian Captaine of the said ship. The Generall
of all the Fléete of Guipusque called Don Michael d'Oquendo,
twentie other Knights and Aduenturers vpon their
owne charges.
               He saith,The Kings base sonne drowned with other principall perions. that the Fléete was in great want of fresh water,
and being examined what ordinance, wines or other matters
of moment were in the ship here cast away, saith, there were
fiftie great brasse péeces▪ all Canons for the field, fiue & twenty
péeces of brasse and cast iron belonging to the ship, there is also
in her fiftie tonnes of Secke. In siluer there are in her fiftéene
thousand Duckets,Fiftie Canons, twēty fiue peeces of ordināce, fiftie tonnes of secke & thirtie thousand Duckets in gold and siluer sonke. in gold as much more, much rich apparell
and plate and cups of gold.
               He saith also, that the Duke of Medina appointed all the
Fléete to resort and méete at the Groyne, & none of them vpon
paine of death not to depart there hence afore they should
know his farther pleasure.
            
            
               The examination of Emanuell Fremosa a Portingall
12. September 1588.
               
               HE saith, he was in the ship called S. Iohn of the porte of
Portingall of one thousand one hundred tonne. In which
Don Iohn Martines de Ricalde is, who is Admirall of the
whole Fléete, and is next vnder the Duke who is Generall, in
which ship at their comming foorth there were eight hundred
souldiers, and for marriners thréescore Portingales and fortie
Biskeyns, this is the greatest ship of the whole Nauie.
               He saith, they were in all at their comming foorth a hundred
thirty and fiue saile, wherof foure were Galliasses, foure Gallies,
and nine of them were victuallers.
               
                  
They came from the Groyne on the fifteenth day next arter
Midsommer last past, by their accompt.
               He saith they were directed to the Duke of Parma and by
him to be imployed for England at such time as Parma should
appoint.
               He saith after their departure from the Groine about eight
daies the Fléete came to the Lysardes.
               
               He saith about that place, the Generall strake saile whereupon
they all stroke saile all night, and the next morning they
saw the English Fléete, whereupon they hoised their sailes.
               He saith they were before enformed that the English Fléet
was in Plimmouth and Dartmouth.
               
               He saith on the Northeast of the Lysards the first fight began
betwéene the Fléets,Fifteene men lost in fight vpon the Disards. & in that fight their ship lost fiftéene men.
               He saith that there were other fights within a foure or fiue
daies after along the coasts,Fiue and twentie moe lost in the same ship. in which the ship that this examinat
was in, lost fiue and twenty men, what were lost in these
fights out of the other ships he can not tell, and in these fights
they lost two ships,Two ships lost. in the one of which Don Pedro was, and
one other that was burned.
               They ankered at Callice expecting the Duke of Parma,
where through the fiering of the English ships they were driuen
to leaue their ankers and to depart, so as ech of the ships
lost two ankers at that place, the next morning, the fight began
about eight of the clocke in the morning, and continued
eight houres along the chanell to the North, all which time the
English Fléete, pressed the Spanish Fléete in such sort as if
they had offred to boord the Spanish Fléete, they saw their Admirall
so fearefull, that he thinketh they had all yéelded.
               He saith that in the said fight the Spanish Fléete lost one
Galliasse,
                  One Galliasse cast on shore. which ranne a shore about Callice, two Gallions of
Lisbone which were sonke being the kings,Two Gallions and one Byskeine sonke. and one Biskeine
ship sonke, of betwéene foure and fiue hundred tonnes, and
one other ship sonke also, after which fight, the Generall tooke
accompt of the whole Nauy, & found that they were left about
a hundred & twenty sailes of the whole Fléete, as was deliuered
by those that came frō the top, but of his owne sight he saw

not passing fourescore and fiue saile or there about, but what
was become of the rest he cannot tell.
               He saith that there were also in that fight thrée great Venetian
ships,Three Venetian shippes sort beaten with shot. which were in danger of sinking, being sore beaten
and shot through in many places, but were for that time holpen
by the Carpenters, and as he hath heard, for that they
were not able to kéepe the Seas, tooke them selues toward
the coast of Flanders, but what is become of them he cannot
tell.
               He saith they were pursued by some of the English Fléet about
fiue daies after this fight Northward out of the sight of any
land, and as he thinketh of the North part of Scotland.
               He saith that about foure daies after the English Fléete left
them, the whole Fléet remaining being towards one hundred
and twentie saile, as it was said, came to an Iland as he thinketh
of the North part of Scotland, where they stayed not, nor
had reliefe, but at this place the General called all the ships together
giuing them in charge that they should with the best
they could hast them to the first place they could get to of the
coast of Spaine or Portingal: for that they were in such great
distresse, through their great wants of victuals and otherwise.
He saith they came foorth the worse furnished thereof, for that
they expected to be reléeued of those things more amply by the
Duke of Parma: he saith that out of this ship there died foure
or fiue euery day of hunger and thirst, and yet this ship was
one that was best furnished for victuals, which he knoweth, for
out of some of the other ships some people were sent to be reléeued
in this ship.
               After this for a ten daies the whole Fléete remaining, held
together, holding their course the best they could towardes
Spaine.
               He saith that at the same time, which is now about twentie
daies or more past, they were seuered by a great storme which
held from foure of the clocke in the after noone of one day, to
tenne of the clocke in ye morning the next day, in which storme
the Admirall came away with seuen and twentie saile which
this examinat did tell, and that one of them was a Galliasse

of eight and twenty owers on a side, what is become of the rest
of the Nauy he can not tell.
               He saith also that about ten dayes past, they had one other
great storme with a mist, by which storme they were againe
seuered, so as of those seuen & twenty saile there came into the
coast by Dingle Cushe, but the Admirall, one other ship of
foure hundred tonnes and a barke of about forty tonnes, and
what is become of the rest of the seuen and twenty saile he can
not tel, but of one great Hulke of foure hundred tonnes which
was so spoiled as she cast towards the shore about twenty
leagues from Dingle Cushe, he knoweth not who was Captaine
of this Hulke, he saith that of all sorts there be now remaining
in the Admirall néere about fiue hundred, of which
there be fiue & twenty Biskers & fourty Portingals which are
marriners, the Master being very sicke and one of the Pilots.
               He saith, there be foure score souldiers & twenty of the mariners
in the Admirall very sicke, and do lie downe and die
daily, and the rest he saith be all very weake, and the Captaine
very sad and weake, he saith this Admirall hath in her fiftie
foure brasse peeces, and about foure score kintals of pouder.
               He saith they were so néere the coast before they found it,
that by meanes of the strong Westerly winde they were not
able to double out from it.
               There is in the Admirall left but fiue and twenty Pipes of
wine, and very little bread, and no water, but what they
brought out of Spaine, which stinketh maruellously, and their
flesh meate they can not eate their drought is so great.
               He saith no part of the Nauy to his knowledge euer touched
vpō any land vntil such time as they came to this coast at
Dingle Cushe, nor hath had any water, victuall, or other relief
from any coast or place sithence the English Fléete left them.
               He saith, that when they lay before Callice there came a
Pinnace to their fléete from the Duke of Parma who told them
the Duke could not be ready for them vntill the Friday following,
but by reason of this fight of the English Fléete with
them, they were not able to tarry there so long.
               He saith, that the Admirals purpose is vpon the first winde

that serueth, to passe away for Spaine.
               He saith also, that it is a common brute amongst the souldiers,
if they may once get home againe, they will not meddle
againe with the English.
               He saith, there be of principall men in the Admirals ship,
Don Iohn de Lina a Spaniard, who is chiefe Captaine of the
souldiers of that ship, Don Gomes a Spaniard, an other Captaine:
Don Sebastian a Portingall gentleman an Aduenturer:
and a Marquesse an Italian, who is also an Aduenturer,
and one other Portingall Gentleman whom he knoweth not,
but that they are principal men that haue crosses on their garments:
other meane Gentlemen there be also in the same ship:
He saith, al the souldiers in this ship were Spaniards, he saith
there are in the small Barke that is with them about fiue and
twenty persons, how many are in the Hulke that is there, he
knoweth not.
               He saith, he thinketh that the Duke is past towards Spaine,
for that he was some twelue leagues more Westerly, then the
Admirall was in the first storme.
               He saith, that the great Gallion which came from the Duke
of Florence, was neuer séene sithence they were in the sight at
Callice: He saith, the people of the Galliasses were most spoiled
by the English Fléete.
            
            
               The examination of Emanuell Francisco a Portingall.
12. September. 1588.
               
               EManuell Francisco a Portingall, saith in all things as the
former examinat, till the fight at Callice, in which fight he
saith he knoweth there was lost a Galliasse that ran ashoare
at Callice, two Gallions of the Kings, the one called S. Philip
of the burden of seuen hundred, and the other called S. Matthew
of eight hundred, a Biskeine ship of about fiue hundred,
and a Castillian ship about foure hundred tonne all sunke.
This he knoweth for that some of the men of those ships were
deuided into the Admirals ship, in which this examinat was.
               He saith, after this fight ended, it was deliuered by him at

the top, that there was one hundred and twentie saile left of
the Spanish Fléet, and saith that those were very sore beaten,
and the Admirall was many times shot through, and one shot
in their mast, and their deck at the prow spoiled, and doth confesse
that they were in great feare of the English Fléete, and
doubted much of bording.
               He saith, the Admirals mast is so weake by reason of the shot
in it, as they dare not abide any storme, nor beare such saile as
otherwise he might doe, & for the rest he agréeth in euery thing
with the former examinat, sauing that he saw not, or vnderstood
of any Pinnace that came from the Duke of Parma, nor
doth remember that he saw aboue twentie saile with the Admirall
after the first storme: and saith, that those in the shippe
that he is in, doe say that they will rather go into the ground
themselues, then come in such a iourney againe for England:
and saith, the best that be in the Admirals ship, are scarse able
to stand, and that if they tarry where they are any time, they
will all perish as he thinketh, & for himself he would not passe
into Portingall againe, if he might choose: for that he would
not be constrained to such an other iourney.
            
            
               Iohn de le Conido of Lekit in Biskey mariner
12. September. 1588.
               
               
                  IOhn de le Conido of Lekit in Biskey mariner, saith he was
in the ship that the Admirall is in, and that he told the Nauie
after the fight ended at Callice, & that there were then remaining
not passing a hundred and ten or a hundred and twelue
of the whole Spanish Nauie: and saith that a leake fell vpon
one of the Galliasses about fiteene daies past, which he taketh
to be fallen vpon the North coast of this land: he saith, he doth
not remember that there were aboue twentie saile left in the
company of the Admirall after the first great storme, which
fell on them about thirtie daies sithence: he saith the Duke did
giue them expresse commaundement that they should not goe
on land in any place without his order: he confesseth that the
Nauie that remained after the last fight, were maruelously

beatē and shot through,The Spanishe Nauy sore beated with shot by the English▪ and their tackling much spoiled. and their tackle much cut and spoiled
with the shot, and for the rest of the matter agréeth with the
former examinat in euery point in effect, and saith there was
an English Pilot with the Duke. He saith that the Scot that
is taken was taken in the North part, after the English fléete
parted from them in a ship of fifty tonnes in which were about
seuen men, which the fléete hath caried with them, both the ship
and people, sixe of which Scottes were aboord the Admirall,
whereof one is he that is taken.
               He saith,The Spaniard cast their horses and mules ouer boord. after the English Fléete parted frō them the Spanish
Fléete cast out all the horses & mules into the sea to saue
their water, which were caried in certaine Hulks prouided for
that purpose.
            
            
               The reexamination of Iohn Anthonio of Genua mariner.
15. September. 1588.
               
               HE saith his father and him selfe with others came into
Lisbone in a ship of Genua, about a yeare sithence where
they were embarqued by the King of Spaine, that ship was of
about foure hundred tonne.
               He saith his father after this was appointed Pilote in the
ship called our Lady of the Rosarie, of the burden of a thousand
tonne being the Kings: he saith the Prince of Ascule ye
                   Kinges
base sonne came in the companie of the Duke in the Dukes
ship called the Gallion of S. Martine of a thousand tonne, but
at Callice when ye English Nauy came neare thē, this Prince
went to the shore, & before his returne the Duke was driuen
to cut his Ankers, and to depart: whereby the Prince could
not recouer that ship, but came into the said shippe called our
Lady of the Rosarie, and with him there came in also one Don
Pedro, Don Francisco, and seuen other Gentlemen of accompt
that accompanied the Prince. He saith the Captaine of this
ship was Villa Franca of S. Sebastians, and Matuta was Captains
of the Infanterie of that ship. There was also in her Captaine
Suwares a Portingall, and one Garrionero a Castillian
Captaine, Lopicho de la Vega, a Castillian Captaine, Captaine

                  Montanese, a Castillian: and one Captaine Francisco a
Castillian: and Michael d'Oquendo who was Generall of this
ship. There was also in her one Irish Captaine called Iohn
Rise, of about thirtie yeares of age, and one other Irish man,
called Francis Roche. The Prince was of about eight & twentie
yeares of age. He saith there were other Gentlemen Aduenturers
in the ship, but not of that reckoning as the former
were. He saith there were in all seuen hundreth men in this
ship at their comming foorth: he saith, there were about fiue
hundred in this shippe at such time as she sonke: the rest perished
by fight and by sicknesse. He saith, this ship was shot thorough
foure times, and one of the shot was betwéene the wind
and the water, whereof they thought she would haue sonke,
and the most of her tackle was spoyled with shot, this shippe
stroke against the rockes in the sound of the Bleskyes, a league
and a halfe from the land vpon Tuesday last at noone, and all
in the ship perished sauing this examinat, who saued himselfe
vpon two or thrée plankes that were loose, the Gentlemē thinking
to saue themselues by the bote, it was so fast tied as they
could not get her lose, whereby they perished: he saith as soone,
as the ship stroke against the rocke, one of the Captaines slue
this examinates father, saying he did it by treason. He saith,
there came in their company a Portingall ship of about foure
hundreth, who comming into the same sound, cast anker neare
where they found the Admirall of the Fléet at Anker, called S.
Iohn▪
                   in which Don Martine de Ricalde the Admirall was, he
saith that about two and twentie dayes past the Duke departed
from them, and about fiue and twentie ships in his companie,
and about fortie ships were with the Admirall, but this
ship was not able to follow the Admirall, by reason her sayles
were brokē: and for the rest of the Nauie that remained, they
were so dispersed, as he cannot tel what is become of them▪ He
saith the Duke being better watered then the others were,
held more Westerly into the seas, and willed the Admirall
with his company being in worse estate for water to sée if he
could touch with any coast to get fresh water, sithence which
they haue bene seuered by the nights and by tempest: he saith,

this ship nor any other of the shippes touched vpon any land,
nor had any reliefe of water or victuall at any place sithence
they parted, but from two Scottes, which they tooke vpon the
coast of Scotland, whose fish and victuall the Duke tooke, but
paied them for it.
               He saith, their ships were so beaten, and the winde so contrary,
and the sholles vpon the coast of Flanders, so daungerous,
as the Pilot that was in the Dukes ship, directed them
this course Northward as their safest way. He saith, that in
one of the dayes in which the fight was betwéene both the Nauies,
the Duke séeing the English Fléete so hardly to pursue
them willed his Fléete, seing no other remedy, to addresse thē
selues to fight.In the fight at Callice were slaine the Maister of the Cauallary of the Tercij of Naples & Sicile. He saith, that in that day of the fight at Callice
they lost foure thousand men in fight, one thousād were drowned
in two ships, he saith ye master of the Cauallary of the Tercij
of Naples and Sicile was slaine in this fight by a great péece
that brake his thigh, his name he remembreth not: at which
time also the Maister of the Campe of the horsemen,The Maister of the Campe of the horsemen. and the
Maister of the Campe of the footmen were both slaine,The Maister of the Campe of footemen. And foure thousand others, besides a thousand drowned. but their
names he remembreth not: He saith the foure Galliasses were
of Naples: He saith the foure Gallies left ye Fléete, before they
came to ye English by well neare xl. leagues: He saith, the Florentine
ship is gone with the Duke: He saith, there were xiiii.
Venetian ships in this Fléete, two of them he saith are drowned,
what is become of the rest he knoweth not, they serued the
king but by arrest: he saith there be thrée English men Pilotes
in the Dukes ship.
               He saith, this ship that is drowned hath in her thrée chests ful
of money: he doth not know what moued the Duke to cōmand
that ye whole Nauie that remained should repaire to ye 
                  Groine
and not to depart without his direction vpon paine of death.
            
            
               The examination of Iohn Antonio de Moneke xxx. miles
from Ganna. 17. September. 1588.
               
               HE saith, the Prince of Ascule was a slender made mā, and
of a reasonable stature, of xxviii. yeares of age, his haire

of an aborne colour stroked vpward, of a high forehead, a verie
little beard marquesotted, whitely faced with some little
red on the chéeks, he was drowned in apparrell of white satten
for his doublet and bréeches after the Spanish fashion cut, with
russet silke stockings. When this Prince came into their ship
at Callice, he was apparelled in blacke rased veluet laid on
with broade gold lace. He saith, that this Princes men, for the
most part were in the shippe that this examinat was in, from
their comming out of Spaine: and when they were at Callice
the Prince passed in a litte Phelocke with six others from ship
to ship to giue order to them, and some said he went to the shore
at that time.
               He saith, it was thought to be about lx. leagues West from
the Northwest part of Ireland, that the Duke departed from
the rest of the companie. Hee saith, they parted by a tempest
growing in the night, & that about sixe daies after, a Portingall
Gallion ouertaking this ship told vnto those of this ship,
that there were xxv. ships of the whole Nauie passed away
with the Duke, and that the rest then remaining of the whole
Nauy were dispersed by this tempest, some eight in one company,
and foure in another: and thus dispearsedly passed on
the seas. But how many ships remained after their departure
from the coast of Scotland, of the whole Nauy, this examinat
can not tell. He saith that after this first tempest which was about
xxv. dayes now past, growing of a Southwest wind, they
had sundry tēpests before they were lost with variable winds,
sometime one way, and sometimes an other.
            
            
               The reexamination of Emanuell Fremosa.
17. September. 1588.
               
               
                  EManuel Fremosa mariner examined the same day, saith
that the day next before the great tempest, in which the
Duke was seuered from them, being a very calme day, him
selfe counted the Nauie then remaining, which then were
about lxxviij. saile in all: when they were farthest of in the
North, they were at lxii. degrées Northward, and were then about

foure score leagues and somewhat more from any land,
and at the Northwest part of Scotland, Cape Clere being then
from them South and by West, and this was about foure or
fiue dayes, before the said great tempest, and from that time
vntill the same tempest, they had the winde most West, and
West Southwest, and sometimes West Northwest, but that
not very long, he saith that it was knowne to very few of the
Nauy that the Prince the Kings base sonne was in this Nauie
vntill they came to Callice, where this Prince about the
time of the fight, was said to take him selfe into a little boate
vpon the coast of Callice, but before that, he kept him selfe as
priuate in the Dukes owne ship, as it was said, and not noted
or spoken of in the Nauy vntill then. But he saith there was
a great Prince an Italian, that was a chiefe man in a great
Argosie very wel furnished, who before their comming to the
English coast did very often banket the Duke and the other
great men of the Nauy. This Argosie was called the Ratte:
he saith he did not perceiue if this shippe were in this Fléete
the day before the said tempest or not, but he saith this being a
famous ship, it was often demanded, if she were in their company,
and it was answered that she was: he saith, the chiefest
of the treasure that serued for the pay, was as he heard in the
Galliasse that arriued on the shore at Callice, and in a shippe of
Siuil made in Galisia called the Gallega of about vij. hundred
tonnes, in which Don Pedro de Valdez was, which was taken
on the South coast.
            
            
               The examination of Pierre Carrea Flemming.
               HE saith that in the ship that he came hither in called Saint
Iohn a Galliō of nine hundred tonnes, besides Iohn Martin
de Ricalde, there are fiue Captaines, Don Iohn de Lune,
Don Gomes de Galanezar, Don Pedro de Madri, the Count of
Parades, Don Felice, and there is also an Italian Marquesse of
Piemont called the Marquesse of Faruara.
               
               He saith also, that the Admirall after such time as the fight
was at Callice came not out of his bed, vntill this day seuen

nights in the morning that they ranne vpō the shore.The Admirall after the sight at Callice came not out of his bed in seauen weekes and more. He saith
his Admirall is of Biskeye either of Bilbo or Allerede, and of
lxii. yeares of age, and a man of seruice. He saith, that there
were in this nauie of the old souldiers of Naples vnder the conduct
of Don Alonso de Sono & of the old souldiers of Sicile vnder
the conduct of Don Diego de Piementell
                        •
                     
                   whose ship was
lost néere Callice. There was also Don Alonso de Leua maister
of the cāp of the Cauallery of Millan: he saith, there is a bastard
sonne of King Phillips of xxviii. yeares of age in this Fleete in
the ship with the Duke, called the Prince of Ascule in Italie,
who passed from thē in a Pinnace about Callice as he tooke it.
               By other Aduertisements of the fourteenth of September,
it is certified to the Lord Deputie of Ireland, from the Earle
of Tyron being at his Castle of Dongannon that vpon intelligence
brought to him of the landing of certaine Spaniards in
the North of Ireland, he sent two English Captaines with
their bandes towardes them, to the nomber of an hundred and
fiftie, who found them at Sir Iohn Odogherties towne called
Illagh,
                  Sixe hundred Spaniards assaulted by one hundred and fifty Englishe, vanquished & taken prisoners. and there discouering their nomber to be aboue six
hundred, did that night encamp within a musket shot of them,
and about midnight did skirmish with them for the space of
two houres, in which skirmish the Spanish Lieutenant of
the field and twentie moe of the Spaniardes were slaine, besides
many that were hurt.
               The next day following they did offer skirmish agayne to
the Spaniardes, whereupon they all yelded, and so as prisoniers
were caried to Dongannon to the Earle, who meant to
send them to the Lord Deputie, being iudged to be men of good
value and one thought to be a man that hath had some great
charge and conduct of men for many yeares, whereof the Lord
Deputie will geue knowledge as soone as they shall be
brought to Dublin.
               
               There may be some errours in the writing of the Spanish
names in English, because the same are written by way
of interpretation, but there is no errour in the nombring
of the persons that are either dead or aliue.
