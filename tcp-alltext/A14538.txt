            IDo perceaue, and by daylye experience do vnderstād most worshipfull Syr: how men do erre, and are sore deceaued and begi led in the election and choyse of their wiues: and howe vncurtously and vngentlye they do vse and intreate them, that of equitie and ryghte should be most fauourably and pleasauntly vsed and

But yet how these poore silye wemen are handled, and of theyr owne husbandes misordered, contemned, abhored, yea, and oftentimes without cause reiected, I reporte me vnto the gentle reader of this booke: the whiche

And on the other syde, it teacheth your wyues howe to feare and to honour god, howe to loue, obey, aud serue theyr husbandes, how to brynge vp and nourter theyr chyldren, howe to haue an eye to theyr husbandes honestie and profyte, whether they shoulde be learned or no,

            ¶ Of the office and duetie of an husbande.
            
               IT semed vnto the auctour of nature, when he layd ye foundation of the ages and time that was to come, that all suche beastes, which were sub iecte vnto sicknesses & death, should at one generation and birth bringe forth but fea we yongelynges, to thende their generation might encrease, & endure for euer, & that they of a litle beginninge mighte multiplie and arise vnto an in finite multitude, and of mortal thinges obtayne, as it were an immortalitie. But al other beastes do indifferently

(without any order or lawe) obeye nature, and geue them selues vnto procreation. And this is, as it were an vniuersall lawe, where vnto we do perceaue and see, that al maner of beastes do willingly obeye, although there be amōg these, that liue in societie, and obserue the holines of matrimony so vndefiledly, yt they may well instruct and teache many thousandes of men the chastitie, the charitie, ye fayth, the maner, and the qualitie of matrimony, and in this number are swannes, turtledoues,The beginning of matrimony. crowes, and doues. But man beynge borne to lyue in company, and in the communion of lyfe, was bounde by the auctoure of nature wyth more exact and streyghter lawes
of matrimonye. Nor he would not, that man vntemperately shoulde medle with manye women, nor that the woman shoulde submitte her selfe to many men. Therfore he bownde them together in lawfull mariage, and deliuered her vnto the man, not only for generations sake, but also for the societie and fellowshippe of life. And this is it, ye
                  Gene. ij Moses doth saye in Genesis, that the prudent and wise maker of the worlde sayde: It is not good, that man shoulde be alone, let vs make him a helpe lyke vnto him selfe. And how manye vtilities and profites do spryng and yssue of matrimony? First as all controuersies & debates are remoued and do cease amōg men, whē
                  
lādes be occupied & possessed,The vti lities of matrimo nye. & by the power of ye law graū ted & stablished: euē so when ye womā is lawfully maried, al such cōtentiōs do cease, which certaynly wold haue growen among men, yf women were cōmon. For some woulde desire those, that were beautiful and fayre, & suche as were moost mighty and mooste in powre, wold iugde al thinges to be as a reward of their fortitude and strength, in theyr powre and dominion. And he that assayde her, woulde as though he had taken possession, strongly resist, and fyghte for her, as for his owne wife, wherevpon shuld arise enuy, hatred and debate. And man, the which (yf he folow his natural affection and appetite)

is a prowd, a fearce, and a desi rous beast to be reuēged, shal finde manye wayes to accomplishe his luste, and to ensue & reuenge, that he interpreteth to be an iniury, and shall associate and gather manye vnto him, eyther for feare, or by some benefite inticed, wherby parttakings & sactions shuld fyrst aryse, and afterwardes warre, and cruell battayle, both at home and abroad, as olde auctours do reporte to haue chaunced for women ra uished, as for Helen Lacona, Tindarus and Ledas doughter, and for Lucrecia and Virginia

                      second king Henry yt second was dri uen out of his realme by hys

sonne, for after yt he had bene longe in loue with Philippes the Frenche kinges sister, and that she was sente into England, & maried vnto him, his father being in loue with his fayre doughter in lawe, hys sonne making warre in Scot lād, defloured her. The yong woman at the firste cōmynge home of her husband, opened vnto him, what had chaunced and being moued therewith, draue out his father, & occupi ed the kingdome. I let passe those thinges, that Plutarke doth write in hys booke of lo uely narratiōs. Woulde god there were not so many exā
                  ples as geue occasions to eue ry man to write, both of princes, & priuate persons, howe great contention and debate

letcherye hath caused. Thys was to manye a man ye waye & occasion to ouerturne king domes & families, & of greate and bitter perils and calamities among all nations. But god the inuenter of matrimo ny, & moste prouident father, hauing pitie & cōpassion vpon mankind, hath put a measure to this immoderate luxuriousnes, printinge the lawe of matrimony not in paper onely, but in euery mans hearte. In the whiche matrimony he hath geuen to al nations (not onely to those, the which thorough humanitie & good letters are instructed with rites and ciuile customes, but also to fearce and barbarous nations, beyng farre from all good educatiō and customs)

so greate beneuolence & charitie, yt they which are maried iduced through loue, will not leaue nor chaūge their mates & whē there is no loue, shamfastnes doth take place, so ye there is no man so farre frō ye vnderstanding of mā ye is ignoraūt, yt to bea thynge moste scelerate, & worthy to be hated & punished, to seake, or to embrace any other, as lōg as matrimonye indureth. And what a cōmoditie is the wife vnto ye husbād, in ordering of hys house, & in gouerning of hys familie & housholde? by this cities are edified & buylded. And she cometh, euen asGen. ij. god sayth, into her husbādes house, as an helper lyke vnto him self, & as a sure cōpanion continuinge vnto the ende of her life, a partetaker of mirth

& heauines, ye mother of their common children, the whiche kepeth hys goodes as her owne, thinkinge none other goodes to be hers but those, & kepeth thē to leaue them to her children, the which she loueth as her selfe. It can not be spoken, from how great a burden, & molestiousnes the mind of man is lightned ther by, the which for the worthines & dignitie thereof, shulde not be molested with such inferioure cures. But yet I knowe not, whether all theseThe edu cation of chyldren thiges may be cōpared with the education & bringyng vp of children, for surely by certayn & true matrimony, they are receaued & taken for oure owne childrē, wherby they be vnto vs the more dearely beloued.

And charitie willeth them to be nourished, and fashioned vnto al kind of humanitie and vertue, not only wt diligence and cure, but wyth al sollicitude and anxietie. Al other beastes, after that the dame hath nourished them, and that they are once come to a certayne bygnesse, be of nature so instructed & taught that they leaue theyr dame for euer, beynge sufficiente ynough of them selues to shift for theyr lyuynge, and to defende theyr lyues, yt one naturally

                   not beyng better nor worse then the other: nor thē yt yōg do knowledge yt dame no more, nor yt dame ye yong. But as man hath of his maker, & that by a certayne singuler benefite, most excellent,

reason, and figure of mynde: euē so he hath througe sinne corrupted ye seede of vertue, & obserued the lyghte of hys wyt & vnderstandynge. And if he do stande and folow the wayes of his affectiōs, he shal so abace him selfe, that he shal become seruante vnto synne now receaued, & beyng geuen there vnto, how great a beast of a man (a cruell thyng to be spoken) shal he be made then? what obscuritie & darckenes shal grow in him? how vnlike & how farre of shal he be then frō his originall beginning? This obscuritie of mynd and darckenes through doctrine & learnynge maye be cast of, and clarified, and the euyll inclination thereof by good maners & customes amēded.

But this our corrupte & defiled nature hath nead of sollicitude, tyme, labour, & diligence, yea and occasions must be taried for vntyll it grow, vntill it may better perceaue and vnderstand his admonisher, and vntyll it wyll heare and be admonished. And now and then we muste delay and dissemble such vices & fawtes & reserue them vntil another tyme, that they may be taken a waye and remoued withoute any daunger or peryll. Nor it is not sufficiēt to warne hym once or twyce, but often, & nowe & then he must be reprehended & corrected, & sometimes flattered, mynglynge ye were with ye sower. And what ende shall there be at laste of reformynge thys

beast so euill & so brutishe, the which doth so oftētimes (euē of it selfe) returne & fall into this silthines? Who woulde take such endles & dayly renu ing paines and labours, yf he thought not the childrē to be his owne? and yet he taketh these paynes with those, the which he trusteth & beleueth to be his by lawfull mariage, furthermore the loue of the parentes doth redounde vnto their children, & augmenteth their loue & charitie towardes thē, as hatred dothe diminish & extinguish ye same, as the fabelles do declare ofMedea. 
                  Medea, the whiche, after she perceaued, yt Iason had forsa ken her, being moued with yt iniury, & prouoked with a cer tayne bitter hatred agaynste

her husbande, murdred her owne childrē. And Euobardus
                  Euobar dus. hated his sonne Nero, ye which was Emperoure, because he had childrē by Agrippa, yt fearce & cruel woman. And ye loue of the husband & wife towardes theit childrē, doth fortify & strengthen the loue bitwixt thēselues: for he loueth his equal, as ye wife herein is, whē she loueth her childrē, whiche are deare vnto their father, as her husband doth, whence they haue a double loue, and strēgthe bet wixt thē selues, & another bending from their children, for we loue those, yt loue the thinges, whiche are deare vnto vs. Therefore fathers hauing good affectiō & mind vnto their children, receaue thē, & after their possibilitie

And yet beynge thus instructed. they leaue thē not so nor cast thē not of, nor depart not from them, as other beastes do, but defend them, embrace thē, & after theyr pos sibilitie adourne thē, nourishe them, & helpe thē. Nor thys beneuolence doth not subsiste & rest in thē onelye, but stretcheth for the vnto the sonne & doughter in law, 
                     〈◊〉

                     〈◊〉
                   & reconciliacions haue oftentimes yssued, and cities haue

had theyr beginninge. This loue doth descende vnto oure neues and cosing, and taketh care for the posteritie. And in that nature, which is partet a ker of iminortalitie, doth regard the eternitie, the which throughe generation shal ensue & folowe, where vnto theFamisies house, the familie, yt patrimonie, & parentage are constituted & made, the name of the kinred, as it were the note & marke of a certayne flocke remayning: ye which family geuinge it selfe to ydlenes and pride, is no other thinge, but the beginning of al flagitious nes & misihiefe, & for the time it so remayneth, shal neuer be without some mischiefes, cruel, vnquiere, and violente oppressor of other mens libertie

the which taking only a pride of his name sercheth to excel al other trusting in honest ar tes & knowledge. So on the other side, it is a thing moste beautiful, yt the youth of that familie or house maye haue a certayn discipline & art of honeste liuinge, to be vsed with lawde & prayse: yt which their parentes should deliuer vnto thē from hande to hand with their inheritage & name, as a remembraunce of good workes, with domestical and fami liar exāples, to ensue & folow the same. Who can declare yt great cōmodities of all those thinges, the which by ye gyfte of god we haue obtayned to ouerrunne & finishe this lyfe withal? We are farre gone frō the rites and customes of

beastes, & humanitie hath she wed her selfe garnished with order, lawes, & discipline, the which thinges shuld separate & leade vs frō vice, & place vs in the trade & way of all vertue. One Eue was geuen toOne mā one wife. one Adā, as one Churche to Christe, as the holye Apostle dothe interpretate it to be aEphe. v great mistery, as perteyning to Christ & his churche. And one man ought to be the husband of one wife, as nature it selfe doth saye: & as the lawe of god better, then the law of nature, & the true expositour of the same dothe teache vs: first by the cōposition of ye bodies, & by the maner of generation, the whiche by the embrasing of two bodies is made perfecte, but yet by a more

secrete misterie, for the loue of two is best & without emulation, for when two or mo doo loue one thing, it is not without enuy, for very hard it is, yt one shuld loue two equally, or shew, or els suffer it selfe to be of thē beloued; & he of those two yt shall perceau, yt he is best beloued, shal waxe insolēt & prowd, as victorious in bat taile, & the other not being so wel accepted & beloued, shall burne as ouercomde with sorow. & enuye his corriuale & fellowe in loue: for other he would possesse the thing seue rally alone, or els be principal in the possessiō therof: where out shuld arise hatred, strife, & trouble in the family, ye which thing the fearcenes of man wt some great tumulte & pertur

bation of thinges shuld cause, or els through the debilitie, ye cōplayntes & importunitie of the woman, which hate none other weapons, trouble shuld encrease, & cause a mans life to be intollerable, not onelye chafing nowe & then with his fellowe in loue as with a strō
                  pet, but also with her husbād. This thing is not expediente for quietnes & pleasaunt tran quillitie, the whiche shuld be at home & in the familie, wher vnto euery man defatigated, & with matters of the cōmon welth priuate or exterior wetied, do draw them selues as vnto some sure port or hauē. But yf quietnes be so vexed & disquieted at home, and all thinges troubled with hatred, where shal then ye minde

of man tost with so many care full tempestes repose it selfe? Truly a man had rather inha bite among the litigious striles of the law, among the tē
                  pestes & surges of disputatiōs & in the ieoperdies of peregri nations, thē to returne home to such an vnswete, vnsauery, & bitter life. For in the amitie and loue of many, the one beholdeth & loketh vpon the other, & not al vpon one, as ser uaunces behold & looke vpō their Lord and mayster. For when two or thre behold one, yt is no 
                     〈◊〉
                  , but riualitie, & coutention, or els a dominion of many vpon one, in the whithe kind & estate, there is wōt to be enuy, hatred, & trouble, when yt the fauour and loue 
                     〈◊〉
                   al desired, inclineth to one alone.

And therfore at ye beginninge, God gaue to one Eue,Gen. vii one Adā, to be her Lord and mayster. And beinge minded to drowne the world, he caused certayne men & their wyues to enter into the arke for the conseruation & generation of mankind. But the preceptes & cōmaundementes of god do verye wel declare the strength & force of nature, the which being in vs corrupted by the varie tie of affectious leading vs to diuers & cōtrary thinges, is by the celestiall oracles & preceptes restored agayne vnto hys integritye. In Genesis Adā (as it were diuining)Gene. ii sayd, yt two men shuld be in one fleshe, vnto ye which wordes the lord our god dyd adde this, ye matrimony once

cōsumed & made perfect, they are no more two, but one mā yt it might euidently appeare,Note. that true matrimonie cā not be betwene thre or foure, but betwene two onelye. And as oft as god him selfe speaketh of matrimony, he neuer sayth husbandes & wiues, but wife and husband. And the Apostle.i. Cor. vii. S. Paul to auoyd fornicatiō geueth counsel, that euery man shuld haue his wife, but he neuer sayeth hys wyues. And truly whē the lord doth inhibite, that men shuld not re fuse their wiues for any cause except it be for fornication, hemat xix forbiddeth the multitude of wiues, for if he mary anotherMar. x. he calleth him an aduouterer. Why shuld he be an aduouterer,Luc. xvi. that marieth another, his

first wyfe beinge yet alyue, yf it were lawfull for him at one tyme to haue manye wiues? These he the lawes of nature the which in very dede shuld haue sufficed, yf oure malitiousnes had lefte oure nature pure and whole, as it came frō the handes of his maker. But being now violated thorough vice, & inclininge vnto malitiousnes, the age & time yt ensued, found remedies for this infirmitie, as it were cer tayne barres & doores to represse vice withal, yt it creepe no farther. For the worlde in the fyrst encrease of mans generation, being yet but yong, part of our old & rude elders dyd dwel in caues, and parte whē the cities were buylded, in houses. And at the begynginning

the husband and the wife kept house together, thē were children begotten and borne, vnto the whiche there arose an incredible loue, kind led with the fyrebrand of nature. These childrē beyng of age, maried wiues to encrease mākind withal, & their childrē encreased, by whose meanes the loue of the fathers paste on vnto the sonne and doughter in law, & frō thence vnto theyr neues, & all these coupled together by the selfe same loue and charitie, remay ned in one house, beyng parta kers of one fyre, loue makyng althinges cōmon, or to speak more truly one thing onelye. But consanguinitie & affinity crepte in alytle further. & beyng many in nūber, wold not

depart frō yt familye, because they of youth were broughte vp together (for there is no sweter thinge, then of childrē to haue bene conuersaunte & acquaynted) & because they were suche persons, whome they loued as thē selues, they could not be departed, except they shuld haue bene seperated & drawen frō thē selues. And although certayn of thē were remoued & gone, as it were to dwel in another place, yet that notwithstandinge they oftentimes returned vn to theyr originall house, and were most familiarly conuersaunt together. But suche as were wyse, and by longe expe rience witty, perceauing that chastitie through the feruent nes and heate of youth was

Euery man marueiled, from whence such force & strength shulde come, wherewyth so many thousand hartes with one accorde shulde desyre and seke for one thinge, shuld confesse one Christe, shuld speake one thynge, and obtayne and come to one ende. They cared nether for mony nor yet for their lyues, they sought for no superioritie, they refused theyr owne howses, families, parentes, kynsfolke, yea

Nor they cared not for any impedi mentes or caredge yt doubted not to obtayne by this victori suche infinite rewardes and goodes. Nor they had no leasure in such celeritie of age to think vpō any other thing, beynge thus occupyed and reuished wyth thys hyghe thought and cogitation. But this heat of pietie flowing vn to vs from Christ, as it were from some excellent fontaine, is as careful for other, as it is sure & certayne of it selfe, and is beautified & adorned with singuler prudency & wisdom. But the more that this heate

is kindled, the more this wisdome doth shewe it selfe, & for gettinge of it selfe, doth profite on her, yf that any thynge may be lacking in such feruēt and aboundant charitie.

The iudgemēt of the mynde is the gouernoure of mans lyfe, the whiche yf it go not before all our dedes, we shall slyde and fall

into such greate yeoperdies, as we do le daylye chaunce & happen amonge men. They do wel consider, what thinge they should eate or drincke, but whome they do call vnto their frendship, & cōmunion of life (the which are much more hurtefull, or profitable then meat) they care not. So they do loue preposterouslye, or euer they know or iudge what they do loue, the which error dothe brynge vnto the lyfe of man more euil & more misfortune then can be spokē, wherby so many and great frendeshippes through cruel dissenti on are chaunged, & loue most vituperiously & shāfully broken, the whiche suche men as by nature and custome could not long endure and cōtinue

inloue, had craftely begon & vnwisely. They shuld first by nature and with reason haue iudged, and then embraced yt thinge with loue, or with hatred auoyded the same, the whiche yf man ought to do in choosynge of frendes, howe much more diligently ought it to be done in the choyse of a wife, the principal of al amitie and frendshippe, whose name among al other in beneuolēce and loue is most dearest. Epictetus 
                  The sayinge of Epictetus.
                   a philosopher, of ye secte of Stoickes, doth saye, that euery thing hath his eare, so that yf thou take holde there at, thou mayst vse it most hādsomely & cōmodiously. True wisdome is, to knowe the nature of euery thinge, and the vse therof. Yf thou whē thou

takest a wife, wouldest thynk vpon thy children, and howe thou mayeste liue with thy wife, thou canste not lightlye fayle in the choyse of her, the whiche (as Zcnophon dothe write in his Economica) maketh very much for the felicitie or misery of mā. For how much ye more a thinge is vnited & knit vnto man, so much the more it may helpe him, yf it be good, or hynder him, yf it be euill. Those dāmages & hurtes (which are inwardly in ye body) are worse thē those which are without: & those of ye soule, then those of ye body: & likewise menne do iudge of those thinges, which are called good. But peraduēture it shall appeare vnto some that these thinges are not vniuersally
 true, for vnto some the losse of their goodes is more thē ye losse of their helth. But this thing doeth not arise or happen of the treasure or moneye it selfe, but because they perswade vnto them selues, yt to loose theyr treasure is a thing intolerable, & therfore the goodes are not of more estimation, then is helth, but thaffection doth rule in thys thing. And therfore it semeth lesse to some to be dreuen out of his kingdom, then to other some to loose a small portion of his patrimony. Some wil reuēge a word most cruelly, and some other wel buffeted and beaten wil not reuēge it at al. All these thinges do pro cede & come of ye soule, ye whiche as most inwardly loyned

knit vnto man, hath more power in him, then the bodye, yea (as Plato thinketh) then man him selfe. If it be then of so great importaunce, what maner of frende thou haue to liue cōmodiously or ineōmodi ously withal the whiche shall none otherwise dwell nor be in the selfe same chāber, bed, nor house with the, but that thou mayest shake him of at thy pleasure how much more then oughteste thou to take hede, when thou choosest thee a wife, the which must cōtinually be conuersaunt with the at thy table, in thy chamber, in bed, in thy secretes, and finally in thy heart and breste. If thou go from home, thou dost cōmit thy house, thy fami lie, thy goodes and thy chyldren

of all other thinges the most pleasaunt vnto her: she is the last, that leaueth the at thy departing, & the first that receaueth thee at thy returnynge, thou departest frō her with swete embracementes & kisses, and with swete kysses and embracemētes she receaueth thee, vnto her thou disclosest thy ioye and heauines.

In the beginning of these, thou must diligently deliberate & cōsult with thy selfe, as Prodigus the Sophist doth saye in the first booke of Zeniphons cōmentaris, yt he caused Hercules to take auysmēt, whether he shuld folow vice or vertue. And in asmuche as it is a matter of great weyght & importaūce. let it not be greuous vnto yt reader to reade it, for it shall not greue me to declare & open the thing more copiously

& clerely. And seing yt electiō
                  Election or choyse is nothinge els but to take a thing mete & cōuenient to the ende it is prepared for, therfore euery one, yt must choose, ought to regard the end, & know what thinge is cōuenient for it. It is nede ful also, yt he be prudente and wise, for els he cānot dispose it, nor perceaue what is cōmo dious & mete for yt end. Nor wisdom is not obtayned nor gottē, but by the knowledge, vse, & experiēce of thinges, & not by folowing of ye affectiōs the which do diminish mans iudgemēt. Ignoraūce & the troublesōnes of the mind is ye very cause, yt yongmen iudge not thinges so wel, as old mē do, they knowe not the businesse of mans lyfe, and beyng

but new and rawe in al thinges, they are sone deceaued: & stird with affections theyr mindes by so obfuscate and cloudye, that they can not see what is right, nor how thinges ought to be done and ordred. Therfore the yonge mā

                   shuld leaue the care of this electiō to his parentes, yt whiche haue better iudgement & are more free from the agitations and motions of al affections, then they are. And inasmuche as they do loue their childrē excedingly, they wold that their children shoulde be none otherwise coūseled, thē thēselues, for the father (as it nath bene sundry times by manye examples declared) doth in a maner loue his childe more, then he loueth hym

selfe. The yonge man muste take hede that folowyng the light iudgement of his owne affection & mind, he chaunge not a short delectation & plea sure into a continuall repentaūce. We do learne by great & continuall vse & experienceNote. of thinges, yt the secrete contractes of matrimonye made betwene those that be yong, are seldom fortunate & lucky, and feawe to be vnlucky that are made, and stablished by their frendes and parentes. Al the old mariages of the Ie wes and gentiles were made after this forme and maner.

They muste not haue before their eyes these vayne & foolishe honours, nor the enuious and vnsure power, nor ye vnquiete factions, nor riches the which vnto olde men are wont to be moste acceptable: for that were euen to brynge vnto their children (whileste they fulfill & accōplishe their proper wil & affections) a mi serable and a wretched lyfe, and a burden intolerable.

And yf thou prepare for thy sonne nobilitie, riches, power and dignitie to serue thy cō

But to thintent that euery mā may know, what he shuld looke to haue of a womā or euer he choose her, I haue determined we fewe wordes to describe the nature of a womanne, to thende that no man lokynge to haue of her thynges impossible shoulde be deceaued. A man doth cō

                  In yt soule there is as it wereThe nature of man. two partes: ye superior wherin is iudgement, counsell and reason, the which is called the mind. The inferior part is, in the which are the motions & perturbations, the which the Grekes cal Pathi. The affections do growe of opinions, the which are more in one, thē in another after the disposition, the customes & vsaunce of the bodye, age, helth, maner, vse of liuing, time & place: the which dochaunge and moue the disposition of the bodye, & consequētly do worke in that part of the soule, that is annexed vnto the body, the which we cal the inferior parte, and therefore the affections, as ye persuasions of thinges & opinions be, are common to al ages.

But yet some of thē are of more power in man, then in woman, & contraryewyseThe nature of women. in woman, then in man. After yt nature hath cast the sede of man into the motherly & natural place, it incorporateth the same, and yf it find sufficient heate, it bringeth forth a man childe, yf not a woman. So that when it wanteth yt most excellent, actiue, & liuely qualitie, the woman remayneth feble & weake, not onely in humayne generation, but also in all other proportion of her kynd, and through suche filthines as increaseth in her (the which yt feble heate that is in her, is not sufficient nor able to caste forth) she is lesse of stature, & more sickly, then other be, and of this by & by

(yf she be not greate bellied) she fuffreth her mēstrua: she is time rous also, for it is heat that encourageth the man, & maketh him bold and hardy, and through feare, she is coue tous, & taught secretly by nature: she knoweth her selfe to be feble, and nedefull of many thinges, & busye about many trifles, & lyke vnto a ruinous house, that muste be vnderset and vpholden wyth manye smal proppes. And throughe feare she is full of suspition, cō playntes, enuious, and troubled with manye and diuerse thoughtes. And for lacke of experience of thinges, of wisdome, and of knowynge her owne debilitie, she thinketh continuallye that she shall be despised, and therfore in this

therfore they are not onelye found in women, but also in such men, as other of nature, or els by the first constitution and making of the bodye, the whiche can not be chaunged, are woman like, or become such through age, as children and aged persons, or by some other casualtie or chaunce, as they that are longe diseased both in minde and bodye, nor yet al women haue not these fawtes in lyke sorte & maner, for there hath bene, & are yet not a few, which are of a more stronge and constant mynde then many men be.

temple then that, the whiche euery man among al nations marueylinge at her vertues, haue in theyr owne heartes buylded and erected. But these thinges, the whiche are nowe knowen vnto all men, shal be hereafter worthelye & diligentelye declared. These thinges before rehersed were spoken to this intente, to declare that as man can not be chaunged, nor vtterly deli uered of his affections, so let no man hope to chaunge a wo man frō her proper & natiue nature: make her better he may. but he shal neuer wholy adnichilate her assections, for as it is not in him to make of a woman no woman, so it is not in him to make of a mā no man. And breuely to saye,

a man shall be continuallye a mā, that is, a feble beast, impoMan. tent, mutable, subiect vnto in firmities & affections, inclyninge to euill, the whiche by learning may be amended, & empayred by euill customes. We must beare with these affections in woniē, as we bear with them in other our frendes, except we do intende to auoyde al cōpany, & liue solitariously in wildernes. And the affectiōs of womē oughte more reasonably to be suppor ted & borne withall, then the affections of men, the which are fearce, & can hardly be tamed, or ruled, and thoroughe a false spies of libertie, yt whiche doth teache thē, they refuse & disdaynfully cast of the bridle. But as women are

farre more weaker then mā, so they are farre more meke and humble: therefore thou mayste brynge them vnder, and rule them other by manlye power, or by sharpenes of witte, by wisdome, or by the longe vse and experience of thynges. And it is muche more greuous to suffre an euill mayster then an euill seruaunt. And truely a woman, seing that she is vnder the do minion and power of manne, ought to be suche a one, nor we shoulde not mistruste, but that the diuine sapience hath touched all thinges strongly from one ende to another, &Sa. viij. doth order them most louing lye.

                  , that man shuld not, will, nor wishe a woman to haue any other af fections or conditiōs, altheughe they might channge thē. For yf the woman were robust and strong, both of mind & body, howe could she suffre to be obediente and subiect to him, yt were no stronger then

her selfe? would she not waxe insolent & proude, hauynge in wil to rule both house and houshold, & to striue peraduē ture with her husbande for yt maistery? who could kepe suche a bold peace at home, but yt she woulde be abroade? yf she be prodigall, she will neuer saue that her husbād gaineth the which sauing is for a mās houshold, a thyng most necessary. If she neglect or litle regard small thinges, how shall she kepe the instrumentes of her house, ye whiche are made of manye small peeces? howe shall she kepe her housholde stuffe, among the whiche are manye vile thinges worne, destrued & brokē? who wold take vpon him the office and charges of a house? or the office

of a cooke? who woulde nourishe & bring vp childrē? what a torment were it for a man to do those thinges? a man wold rather leaue all, & dwel in a desert, then to dwel in such misery and bondage. The loquacitie of the woman so it be with measure, is nowThe loquacitie of wemen & then a pleasure vnto a man weried with publike and priuate matters, for thē also she learneth her childrē to speak, & other thinges conueniente for that age, to the which the nobilitie of man wolde not incline. Furthermore she prepa reth and seeth, that all thyngesCleanlinesse, be cleane and nete, the which thing is not only commodious for the life of man & profitable to refreshe his spyrites withal, but also for hys

helth, the which is more (thē can be wel expreste) offēded, and noyed with vnclendlynes, nor that witte doth not appeare to me to be cleane, yt is nouryshed amonge filthynes. The enuy and emulation that is among womē (so that it excede not) doth so sharpen their manifolde vertues and qualities, and the domestical diligence and custody of their behauour, that they nother speake nor do, whereby they maye be blamed or suspected. Nor superstition in a woman is not intolerable, so that it be not so anxius that true religion be therewith extingui shed. Nor I do not commend that woman, the whiche doth not of a greate carefulnes she hathe vnto religion incline to

superstition, except she be one of the absolute and perfecte sort of matrones. These be the inclinations of women, the which may be bowed vnto that, that is good, as the inclinations of men maye, as hereafter shal be declared.

And it were a great deale better to liue alone, then with an euyll man: and to playe with a whelpe, then to reason wt a focle. O what a madnes were it then, not to thinke it to make any thynge at al to the matter, of what nature & qualities she be, with whome thou muste both lyue & dye, yf perchaūce she be molestious, or otherwyse vnto the, then thoughtes? As touchyng the chylde

two thinges are to be waydeThe childe. and considered, the body and the minde of the woman, and that her body be not to farre out of fashion. The magistrates of the Lacedemonians called Ephori, cōdemned kingEphori 
                  Archidamus, because he hadde maried a wife of a lowe stature, whose children shoulde not sufficientlye ynoughe represent the person and dignitie of a kinge, althoughe this thinge be not of suche importaunce, that a man shuld ther fore refuse his wife, so that she haue sufficiently ynoughe all other qualities. For we do see, that suche short and defor med women bring forth most beautifull and goodlye children. We shoulde rather take bede, that she be not infected

with some infirmitie or strange disease and sicknes, yt whiche ye phisitions do call hereditarie, and do procede from the parentes vnto their children, of the which some there be most filthy, letting the due tie and office of life. These are more diligently to be eschued then those whiche are not so horrible and filthye. And yf thou thy self be infected with anye suche infirmitie. I wold thou shouldest dispose thy self to liue chaste withoute sinne, for as it is a thing most swete and delectable to haue children, so it is verye sharpe and a discomfortable thyng to see them oppressed wyth greuouse infyrmityes and diseases, the which (yf it were possible) we would rather desire

to haue and to suffer our selues, then with our so greate payne and heauines to se thē in our children. And therfore we oughte to consider & take hede, yt our myndes be sound, and that oure contagiousnes nor vice, nether by nature nor by custome do infect our children. I saye the selfe same by the man, for this is the office and duetie of a good man, to be contente with his misfortune and chaunce, & not to let it creepe forth to infect other. If we vse suche loue & charitye vnto oure frendes, that they in no wyse, nor maner be not infected wyth oure infirmytyes, howe muche more shoulde we be studious towardes our owne childrē? And fathers thus counseled

do vse to mary their childrenNote ye yong men for yonge men will heare no suche counsell, for the more madder they be, the more wiser they thinke them selues. And that is the chiefest poynt of all madnes, to thinke hym self wise. Unto these thinges adde this, ye thy childes mind be not throughe education & maners contaminated, for yt thing is very hurtfull for thy sonne, and pestiferous for thy daughter, the which beynge nourished and brought vppe with their mothers, obeye vn to their counsels and studye in word and dede to ensue & folowe the same. And as for the stocke and kynred, there neadeth not in this consultation of childrē to be any great sollicitude or care, for the chil

dren do folowe thee; and not the woman. Thus muche we haue spoken of children. Let vs now speake of the cōmunion of life, wherin must be considered thinges bothe good & euill, profitable and vnprofitable. Loue whereof amitieLoue. dothe take her name, dothe growe of this opinion, yt the thing is good and fayre: and this is the knot of amitie, the which once taken away, amitie fayleth. And therfore true and durable loue, is onelye amongeTrue loue where those that are good, amonge whome there is but one constante rule and maner of liuinge. But the euill vnited and coupled together we an euill intent and desire are no longer frendes, then that desire endureth, for yf that

vanyshe awaye and fayle, the force and strengthe of theyr loue and amitie doth decaye, for the knot that knit fast it to gether is remoued. And therefore we muste consider both the goodnes of the mind and of the body, and whether suche thinges as chaunce and happen vnto man of the exterior thinges, be good after ye mind of the Peripatikes, are euil or cōmodious or incōmodious after the mind of ye 
                  Stoickes, but I labor not greatly in these thinges. In the soule are these, sharpnes & dulnes, swiftnes & slouthfulnes, subteltieThe thin ges of yt soule and body. & simplicitie, malignity & goodnes, helth & infirmitie, inclinatiō to vice and vertue variablye, and suche thinges which are gottē by vse, as artes,

knowledge, rudines, wisdom foolishnes, and all vertues & vice contrary vnto these. In the body are these, age, helth, stature, for me, strengthe, and beautie. The exterior thynges are these, kynred, fame, ri ches, dignitie, grace, and condition. I haue reckened vp euen sufficiently ynough these qualities for thys my treatise, because I haue no place here to intreate of thē more largely. These thinges of the body maye be easelye perceaued and knowen. But that yt is inwardlye in man so manifoldely inwrapped & couered is obscure & darcke to be vnderstanded, the whiche canne not be learned nor perceaued more or lesse, but by the exterior actes, as some certayne

dedes and workes are manifest tokens of the passions of the mind, and fome other obscure and confuse. I will not speake of the tokens & signes of Philnomi, but I wil speak more properly and more aptly as touchinge nature and yt common wisdome of manne. The goyng, sitting, restyng, the countenaunce and eyes, the motion of the whole bodye and the sownde of mans voyce are but light & feble sig nifications of a mans mynd? The more certayne tokēs are mans maners and customes, among the which his speacheHow the affections maye be knowen. and cōmunication is the principall, declarynge not onelye mans nature, but also his affections, as thinges procedinge from them bothe. The

prouerbe dothe saye, looke what the man is, such are his wordes & cōmunication. And Socrates when that a certayne yonge man was brought vnto him by his father for to learne, sayd vnto him, speake that I may know thee. For a wise man shall more clearelye know the mind of a yong mā by his cōmunicatiō & speache, then by yt outward gestures, or proportion and making of the bodye. By the speache we perceaue the quicke sentences, whiche procede of the witte, and the vse of a mans communication, as it were a certayne education, and how chaste, how shamefaste, howe graue, howe sober, howe modeste, howe benigne, or els howe dishonest, how vnshamfull,

howe lyghte, howe insolente, howe arrogante, and howe tardious he is, for such is the fontayne from whence this riuer runneth and is deriued. In all other actions of the lyfe, some eftesones and incontinentlye do shewe euen to those that are most rudest and dulleste their intentes and mindes, for the disdaynfull is often angry, the conten tious taketh occasion to saye agaynste the obstinate wyll geue no place, but with bitter and fayned laughter, or wyth euyll and disdaynefull silence stande in hys owne conceyte and opinion. But she that among straungers can not refrayne nor brydle her affections, dothe declare her selfe

to be vnruly and of mind dissolute, and that she wil not be gouerned, nor haue no respect to those, that see her, or that do speake of her. Those signes that procede of loue or hatred, are somwhat obscure and vncertayne, as those be, yt delite or displease. Euerye man deliteth in that he wyllinglye doth, and desireth to haue it familiarly with him, & hateth those thynges that he coueteth to be farre from him. Plato most nobly & moste wiselye woulde that the makers of the lawes, shuld geueMakers of lawes. and applye all their studye, yt the citezins might accustome themselues to delite in good thinges, and hate yt is euyll. For yf they mighte once obtayn this, a fewe lawes wold

serue the citie. For euerye ma might then carye about hym a most iust lawe, that is a moderate mind & a well instituted. The delectatiōs do shew thē selues with the senses & felinges of the bodye, & other by experience and practise do shewe and declare the end of thē to be in the minde of eche one. It muste be considered, what euery man doth desire to he are, see, touche, smel  and tast, what cōmunication doth delyte hym? what bookes? what cōpany? what cōgressions? what pastymes and plaies? what mightes? what rayment? what ornamētes? Nature doth desire nothing so muche as that, that dothe resemble it, nor abhorreth, nor yet auoydeth nothinge so

much, as that, that is vnlike it. And so we maye well perceaue, yt suche is the inwarde minde, as the exterior & outward thinges be, wherin mā deliteth. Of this do loue, hatred, amitie, cōuersation, enemitie, & to flee auoyde & some mens cōpany arise, & are confirmed. But first and mooste principally mens mindes are vnited & knitte together by a certayne secrete consente & similitude of nature, other for the respecte of profite, or by some casual temeritie, as whē menne mete together in one scole, or in one wagen or ship, some other by the waye, or in warfare, or in one office, or at one banket, or by some other necessitie. The firste of these or the most parte are stable & continuall frendes, the other

as longe as there is any profite to be gotten. The thirde do cleue best together, if they be geuen to one maner of studye, or yf they finde in eche other, wherin they maye haue delite & pleasure. For yf they be geuen to diuers and contrary studies, nor finde not in thē selues yt dothe delite and please thē, thei do sone forsake one another. By these thinges we may somwhat behold & see yt blind ambages & circuites of our hertes. For euery mā calleth vnto him, & grede ly doth retayne & hold yt, that is most likest vnto him, or els through a certayn cōtagiousnes, or some familiar cōuersa tiō he becometh like vnto it. For we do read in ye holy Psal mes, yt with yt holy thou shalt

be holy, & with the innocente & the elect, thou shalt be elect & innocent, and with the peruerse thou waite be peruerted. Therefore we oughte to regarde and take good hede, what cōpany she doeth vse wt whome we do intende to marye, and howe longe she hath haunted their cōpany, & whetherCōpanye that by the instinct of na ture, or by any other impulsion she associated her self vnto them, for suche a one through conuersation wil be like vnto thē. And the mayde se ruauntesMaydēs. do oftentimes open & declare the qualities & conditions of their maistresses, as ye olde saying is: such maistres suche maydens. And as Plato saith, such are yt whelpes. For it is verye like yt she, in whose

hande it is to call, whome she lusteth, will cal her, the which is most agreable & conformable vnto her cōditions & nature. And being long conuer saunt together, their vices or vertues, or els their conditions & fashions will creepe vnto thē, the which thing is the more easely to be done, as euery one doth conforme him selfe vnto his nature, whome he doth intend to please. And therfore those maidēs ought not to be considered, that do often chaunge & departe or euer their mindes can be knowen, or with their euill maners do infect other. Nor thei are not to be wayed yt dwell farre from their maistresses, but they only that haue long continued with thē, whose la

bour & seruice about some bu sinesses they haue vsed, & althoughe they be not vicious, yet they may hurte the good name of those, that be honest. Other there be yt are vitious the which must be diuersly cō sidered, for it may be, that she knoweth no such vice, or that she knoweth it. Or it must be serched out whether she may knowe it, and yf she knowe it, men must enquire how profitable the vse therof is, & whether it may commodiously be left or no, or whether that any other man can do the same, & whether she had rather, yt he as of necessitie should do it, & agayne whether she be familiar with him. All these thinges wil sone declare what wil folowe, what she loketh for,

what she woulde, & what she deliteth in. That womanne which doth gladly haunt the cōpany of fatte & well likinge men, but ignoraunte and vnskilful of any honest art apper teyning vnto women, or that doth gladly talke with suche inuitinge him to her table, what should a man beleue or saye that she loketh for, but to do euill? Men by the life thatThe lyfe that is paste. is paste, do take aknowledge of the life that is to come, for the force & strengthe of a custome is great, and howe she hath vsed her self with yong men, with maydens, with ser uauntes, & how she hath supported both good & euill fortune, yf euer she proued them that is prosperitie mekelye & equally, or fearcely & impotētlye

The first be, as to dispute and reason vpon fastinges, & theFastyng. number of prayers, of vowes and of holy peregrinations. And notwithstandinge that fasting and prayer are verye good thinges, & that good & deuout women shuld oftentimes practise and vse thē, yet in asmuche as the euill maye like wise vse thē, they do not clerely shew and setforth the true & sincere religion.

And of these thinges we haue compendiouslye intreated & spokenDissimulation. of. Dissimulation in all

these thinges is sone speied & perceaued, or els it endureth but for a season, and oftē times euen sodenlye it openeth it selfe. For why? a mās mind beinge set and disposed to dissemble, doth easelye euē of it selfe returne to hys proper nature. Let vs therfore nowe returne vnto our purpose, and speake of all those thynges the whiche we haue set in the soule, in the bodye, and in the exterior and outwarde thynges, for whose cause we haue somewhat digrest vnto the thinges that we hitherto haue spoken of. Pietie is the head of al thinges. She that is pitifull doeth neuer euel, nor any thing that may be iusiely rebuked. Thys is the true and natiue

iustice, of the whiche the olde prouerbe doeth saye, that it embraseth all vertue. But the wycked womā at no time doeth anye thynge well, but when she iudgeth it to be for her owne vt ilite and profite. So my preceptes shall haue an eye, and regarde those whiche are not wycked nor perfectly pitifull, for there is not one that is perfectlye pitifull. For Paule doeth saye, that he doeth runne and laboure,i. Co. ix. yf by anye meanes he maye optayne and comprehend. But a great and a well growen pitie is accepted and counted for an absolute andUnchasle women. perfect pitie. Unchast womē are intollerable, what wyse man can suffer any suche, excepte he be wytles? Salomon
                  
sayeth: he that expelleth aProue. xviij. good woman, expelleth a good thing, and he yt kepeth an harlote is a foole, and vnwyse. What loue can a man haue to suche a woman? For the Lorde sayeth, that she hathe violated the mistery of matrimonye. And yet they that amende & returne from their enyll life, oughte not to be numbred among the euel, in asmuche as they haue turned theyr euyl lyfe into a bet ter. She is not muche vnlyke a shameles woman, that beynge naturallye inclyned to euyll doeth not geue her diligence to erect it, but folowynge her naturall pleasure and desyre, doeth by an vse and custome kepe it vnder, and by softe and gentle intreatynge,

nouryshynge of the same, doth augment and increase it. And so it chaunseth that daye by daye, she ta keth more pleasure & more in it, when that it were farre more conuenient to represse it, and by good motions and exercises to wynde & tourne it to better. Of ye which Ouide not withoute a cause doeth speke, saying. She yt for fear committeth not the faute, is an aduoutres, in asmuche as she desyreth it. And this woman is much worse, then she that declareth her selfe to be an open harlote: for amonge these there maye be founde that geue them selues to honesty, the whiche perchaunce were led to dishonestye not by necessitye (for there can be

no necessitie to doe euyl) but by some appearaunce or spice of necessitie, withoute the whiche manye myghte lyue more honestlye. Nor no man can lyue pleasauntlye with her that is euyll spoken of, nor haue amitie or anye concorde with her, that is not naturally and stedfastly witted. And what thynge is more intollerable or more greuous to a wyse man, then to supporte or to suffer a foolyshe companion? And in asmuche as to lyue together, doeth not onelye consiste in confabulation and wordes, but in all other thynges that pertayne to the lyfe of man. Therfore it is to be con sidered and wayed, who it is that wyll be maryed, and

whether he be sharpe or dullWhat thynges are to be considred in hym ye wyll be maryed. witted, what his customes and maners be, whether he be peaceable or angrye, vehement or softe, impetuous, fearefull, a dronkarde or an abstayner from wyne, a nyggarde or prodigal, a wydowe man, or whether he hath ben maryed or no, hauynge chyldren, or withoute chyldren, howe and by what occupation he lyueth, vpon hys landes or by other gayne, whether he be an occupiour or a craftes man, learned or vnlearned, a magistrate or a pri uate persone, of what age, of what health, and strength of bodye of and what stature.
               With these thynges the com modities & incommodities of the woman muste be conferred.

For why a dull wyfe is nothynge meete nor conuenient for a dull husbande, nor an vnwyse woman for a wise man. Who shal rule the familye? Who shoulde nouryshe and brynge vp the children? Yea, what chyldren shoulde these two brynge forth?
               Verye asheades, or yf they be proper and goodlye, they shall for lacke of good education become dull and astonied. And yet ther shalbe a bet ter agrement amonge these, then betwene a wyse man, and a dull or a foolyshe woman. Yf thou marye a foolish woman, as manye men doe, because she is fayre and beutifull, what matter made it, whether thou haddest a faire ymage of Phioia, or suche a

wyfe? For after that thou hast once satisfied thy filthye desyre, thou shalte finde thy selfe in miserye. For who shal gouerne thy house? Wyth whome shalt thou haue communication? Who shall loke vnto thee when thou art diseased? Who shall comforte thee with wordes in thyne anguyshe and payne? What companye shalt thou haue in aduersitie? Who shal reioyce with thee in thy prosperitie? And throughe the dulnes of the minde, they come to vyle thoughtes vnmeete for the reasonable soule, and drawing their husbandes to their proper affections and costumes, they vtterlye do blynde them. We reade in the holye Bible, that the chyldren of

God perceyuynge the doughtersGen. vi of men (before Noes fludde) to be beutiful & fayre, toke them to theyr wyues, the whiche thynge moued God to drowne man kynde. God dyd punysh this thyng because that wyse men, and throughe vertue the chyldren of God, dyd not choose them wyues confirmable to their vertue, but tooke the fleashlye doughters of men, the which dyd drawe the celestiall spirite to earthly and vyle thoughtes, tournynge the spirite to fleash, and from quietnes to the motions of the affections. And therforeGen. vi God doeth saye: my spirite shal not continue in them for euer, for they are but fleashe. And yf thou marye for her

The poore man hatheThe pore mās wife nede of suche a wife as doeth brynge competente ryches with her, or some sufficient occupation where with she maye sustayne and vpholde her selfe with all. But to him that hath sufficiētly ynough to mayntayne hys familye, she that is apte to learne sufficeth, the whiche he may easelye infourwe and fashion to hys owne maners and customes.

Pride, the very monPryde. ster & enemy of quietnes, is amōg al other vices of ye mind, most to be exchued and auoyded. It breaketh loue & beneuolence, with all coniunction & concord, mingling ye swetenes which shuld be principally in matrimony with all bitter sowrnes. The vices whiche do yshue oute of pride are these, arrogancye, fearcenes, wrath, fastidiousnes, & contēpt, the which to be borne or suffred are most greuous tyrannes. But euerye man (except he looke wyselye aboute him) maye easelye be intrapte in the signification of thys vice. Some women there be, the which being fearce vn to straungers, are vnto their

owne most gentle, and suche ought most dearely to be desi red and beloued. Such were those noble women, Penelope, Lucretia, Cornelia, and Portia, the which vnto their husbandes behaued them selues as handmaidens, & towardes al other kepte their estate and dignitie, and their chastitye most strongly: being prompte and readye to washe awaye from that, were it neuer so litle a spotte or blemishe, euen with their owne bloude. But yf she shoulde vse suche pryde towardes her husband, there shoulde ensue greate vnquietnesse and trouble. Suche a womanne maye be thus knowen, when that throughe the zeale of chastitye she is

vnto all other intractable, nothyng regardyng her progenye, her beautifulnesse, or riches, and this shall be the good wyfe that we seake for, and the best keper of womanlye honestie. But yf she thoroughe the foresayd thinges, waxe arrogaunt and proud, she shall be intolerable. ButNote ye wemen. she that hath an eye vnto ver tue, doth flee and auoyde the companye of menne, nor will not gladly commen with thē, fearynge none otherwyse to bespotte the beautyfulnesse of her chastytye, then the Armelyne (as it is sayde) dothe auoyde myrye and durtye places. Thys womanne dothe exchue noble

and ignoble, fayre and foule, riche & poore, & al other men, and shal be as touching all other, excepte vnto her owne husband, a white line (as men saye) in a white stone. But yf the vanitie of those vayne & wordly thinges do vaynelye inspire her, she shall despyse those, which enioye not ye trifles that she is proude of, and shew her selfe moste benigne & affable vnto those that fortune doth fauoure. She that is cruell and sharpe, wyll be as it were a fearce mother in lawe, brawlynge, cruell, and contentious. An obstinate woman shoulde not be maried vnto hym that is 
                     〈◊〉
                  , for that were to put towe vnto fire, and what other thing

shoulde he do at home then, but burne, and she but to laye on woode to kyndle the fyre withall? A prince oughte notA liberall woman. to refuse her that is liberall, no nor yet her that is munificenteLiberalitye. or prodigall, for there is no vertue that more besemeth a prince, nor that wynneth more the fauoure of the people, or that more stablyssheth hyghe and greate dignities then liberalitie, so that it be not myxte wyth rapacitie, nor wyth the desyre to inryche some (as were redde of Sylla,) wyth other mens goodes and substaunce. He that hath chyldren, and doth intende to marye, muste auoyde her that is a rauener, and speciallye a prynce, and a

gouernor of a cite, for by such meanes the euyll are wonte to creepe in, and to corrupte the integritie of men. And we reade that there hathe bene manye rulers of countreyes cōdemned, not for their owne thefte and robberye, but for the thefte and robberyes of their wyues. And for thysNote. cause it was ordeyned in the senate of Rome, Tiberius beynge Emperoure, that all suche as was sente forthe to rule and gouerne the prouinces and countreyes, shoulde not carye theyr wyues with them.
               The negligente woman is vnprofitable for hym that can not be at home with

hys owne familye and householde. A nyggarde is notA niggarde. onlye profitable for him that is poore, but also for hym that in hys goodes and substaunce dothe sustayne and beare the mutabilytye and chaunces of fortune. Nor I speake not thys, because she hathe no power in al those thynges whyche are called thynges of fortune, but I speake of those thynges whiche fortune is wonte with greate varyetye of chaunches to be medlynge wyth all. For why? the patrimonye and goodes of marchauntes are muche more subiecte, and sooner do feele and taste the instabylytye

of fortune, then ye patrimony of husbande men, or of greate princes, or of those yt liue vpō their landes and rentes. He therfore that is set vnder the varietie & mutabilitie of fortune, muste choose and marye such a wife, as is wont in such chaunces to be content with a litle, & can order that lytle both wisely & strongly. Such are they that are profitable, sober, and borne of a good stocke & kinred, nourished & brought vp vnder honest parētes, & taught to feare shame and so to hide their necessitie that it come not abroade, rea dye to eate browne breade, and to dryncke water, to couer theyr pouertie wythall. But she that is poorelye and

baselye borne, but dilicatelye and wantonlye brought vp, after that she hathe once assayed of those delites & pleasures, doeth preferre her belye aboue all honour, & good name and fame. She that is eloquent and well framed toAn eloquēt wife speake, is a pleasure to hym that is heauy spirited, so that she be pleasaunte and not bit ter of wordes, nor to pleasaunt vnto other, the whiche thinge vnto hym that is suspitious and gelous, is a very torment. She that is full of wordes (vnto hym that goeth aboute thinges whiche are secrete, and cannot be disclosed withoute daunger) is verye hurtfull, as vnto secre taries of Prynces, and Emperours

chauncelonrs. The occasion of Fabius Maximus death was, because he declared vnto Linia hys wife, that Posthumus Agrippa was cited by hys graundfather Augustus. It is great wisedom for a man to be circumspecte, & to take hede of him selfe, as it were of disceytes, what he speaketh familierly at the taNote thys. ble, or whē he embraseth his wyfe, nor to discouer anye thynge by gesture or countenaunce, nor to remoue al maner of wrytinges from her, wherby she maye come to the knowledge and vnderstandyng therof, that shuld be opened with so greate danger and peryll. Beautifulnes, ryches, & kynred, cause men to

be insolent & proud, for Ouide doeth saye: that pride doeth faile beutie. And Iuuenal doeth say: that ther is nothing more intollerable thē a riche woman. And Martiall sayeth merely as he is wont: ye aske me why I wyll not marye a riche woman. Because I wil not mary my self to my wife. And Plaute in Asinaria, doeth say: I haue takē money, and with the dowry I sold myne authoritie. The poore that maryeth a ryche wyfe, doeth not so muche lyue in trouble, because hys wyfe is molestlous and greuous vnto hym, as he contynuallye doeth suspecte that she wyll dyspyse and lytle regarde hym.
               
                  And of kynred Iuuenall doeth saye: I had rather haue Venusina, then thee Cornelia the mother of Graccis, yf wt thy many vertues thou brig muche pryde, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   for thy dowrye the greate triumphes of thy kynred.
               And yet all thys moste commonlye doeth consiste in the education and bryngyng vp of the woman. Ther be that are poore, withoute fauour,Is it not so? and baselye borne, the whiche are often times more arrogant and proude, then thei whiche are noble. Marcus Caro the Censor and chiefest of the common wealthe, dyd choose the doughter of Solonius his cliente to his wyfe, the whiche Solonius beleued

that he did but gest with him and wondered that so noble a man woulde be ioyned in affinitie with hym. ButMarcus Caro. what, the olde Caro toke the yonge mayden, the rych, the poore, the noble, the ignoble, the Prynce, a vile and a base borne vnto hys wyfe.
               And yet S. Hierome doeth saye, that she vsed her selfe verye contemptuouslye and proudely vnto her husband, and was dayly lesse and lesse obeydient vnto hym, so that he (whose wordes, whether he spake theym in the senate, or to the people, or in the iudgemente haule, were taken for an oracle) the which was estemed for the most prudent and wysest man of so noble a

citie, vnto whome ther was no man at that time, nother at home, nor yet abrode, nor in warre, nor in peace, nor in quietnes, nor yet in busines able to be compared, had not so much authoritie at home, as vpon a rude, a foolishe, a poore, an ignoble, & an obiect wenche, and yet she was in a maner taken for the chiefest of al other matrones, and for her husbandes sake hadde in great estimation and honor. I heard often tymes at Louayne of a certayne hoste of mine, borne in Phrise lande, that there was in his citie a certayne ryche gentle man, the which purposing to lyue merely & quietlye, toke vnto his wife a woman far vnder

his degre, that is, a pore woman baselye borne and of no great beauty, and yet moste commonly in that countrey there are exceadinge fayre women. But beyng rudelye brought vp vnder her parē
                  tes, she refused to doe the thynges pertayninge vnto his house, and disdained once to touche, or to loke vpon her husbandes shyrtes. This wo man being now dead and departed, and he mnche weried with her rude & filthie educatiō, maried a noble, a riche, a faire, and a woman meete for hys degree, the which did serue him althoughe she had bene his bondmayde, not as cōpelled, nor yet fainedly but wyllynglye and fayth fullye.

She put on, and toke of hysNote'y e women. clothes, and hys shoes, and made them cleane, and hauynge a great familie, wolde suffer none other but her selfe to doe anye thyuge that belonged vnto her husbandes bodye, she mended hys garmentes, washed theym, pleted them, layed them vp, and dyd all other thinges moste promptlye, the whiche her maydens now and then woulde haue bene greued to haue done. And therefore these exterior thynges are euen as euerye mans mynde is instituted & accustomed.
               Nor I wyll not denye but that a woman, yf she be of a peruers nature, wyll arrogantly through her kynred,

ryches and beautye (yf these thynges be lefte her) extolle her selfe, as doeth the flame of fier in a drye and a lyghte matter. A yonge man asked Pirtacus one of the seuen wysePittacus answere. men of Grece, whether he shuld mary one yt was aboue his degre or no, he made him this answere: mary her that is equall with thee. Of the whiche thynge there is an olde Epigram of Celimachus, recited by Laercius. For in tymes paste the olde authours wrote of beautye as it were with certayne argumentes.
               If thou marye her that is fayre, thou shalte haue her common: yf she be foule, and euyl fauoured, she shalbe molestious and greuous, but

yet she shalbe thyne owne.
               If she be fayre, thou shalte haue a pleasure in her. And this. It is a greuous thyng to suffer her that is foule, and a harde thynge to kepe her that is fayre. And therfore they counseyled men to take those, which were neyther to fayre nor yet to foule: And to choose those that were of the meane sorte. For doubtlesse, they that are excellent faire, waxe insolente and proude, for when they see & perceyue that menne beholde and gase vpou them, and that they be as it were in admiration to al men, they beleue that ther is som rare thyng in them aboue al other, not wt standing that with their owne eyes

they do see as in a glasse how good a thynge that beautye is, and doe soone forget it.
               But consider with the eye of the mynde and vnderstandynge, makyng a coniecture of them selues by other, how vnstable a thyng that be auty is. And besydes al thys, that that thynge is hardely kept that manye doe desyre. AndNote therfore a certayne poet doeth say: that there is a great stryfe, where beauty and honestye are ioyned together. And that often tymes vnder fayre faces are hydden filthy mindes. But she that is very deforme and foule, not withstandyngeDeformite. she be most tender lye beloued, yet she beleueth it not, thinkynge her selfe vn

worth ye: and is gelous of all those, that her husband doth other behold or speake vnto. Amonge the whiche ther are some, in whom this sentence may be well applied and veri fied. The foule & euyl fauoured are ofte chaste, although there lacke no wyll, but the aduouterer onelye. But yet in thys thynge, after as the qualitie of the man is: there are certayne commodities that the luxurious & fastidious man may haue to satiate and fulfyl hys wyl with all, & he that is suspitious and in gelosye maye be in suretye.
               All these thinges are not catholike, and yet it is wont to chaunce thus. All thynges be in manne, as the mynde of

is, but specially, after as it is infourmed of youth, and stablished by vertuous customes and maners. Hys wyfe that with his handes doethThe labo rers wife labour for hys lyuing, ought to be robuste and stronge, so that she maye helpe and laboure with hym, as in plowinge and harrowynge of hys lande. The wyfe that is sickly is verye moleste and greuous, yf it lette her to beare children, or to do suche thynges as of necessitie muste be done at home. Hesiodus, Plato, and Aristotle, wyl that ye man be thre and thyrtye yearesThe yeares of ma riage. of age, and the woman eyghtene or euer they doe mary. For the man beynge vnder those yeres is not of sufficiēt

strength to get children, and the chyldren are but feeble, nor encrease not as they should doe, nother in stature nor in strēgth. And he being inexpert, doth not rule his fa milie & houshold as he should do, where he beareth because of his youth, but litle authoritie, nor his children do not re uerence hym, the which doth appeare vnto them, not as a father, but a brother. And yf he be verye olde, he can not helpe his yonge children, nor they hym, but haue nede of other mens ayde & helpe, and doth depart, or euer he make any prouision for them. And women before they be eyghtene yearrs of age, are not mete to beare children, & doe

trauell of chylde with greate parel and daunger. Nor it is not expedient to accustome her beinge so tender & yonge to venerialcopul ation, for lecherye is there by enflamed, and ye body can not haue hys due increase, Nor such a yong thing can not rule her family being inexpert of all thinges, and cōming to a more perfect age, she wyll not be ruled by her husband, for her conditions and maners are so growen and rooted in her, that they can not be chaunged.
               Finallye, the foresayde ages doe well agree, and are conueniente, bothe for theym to lyue together in Matrimonye, and also to eugender and bring forth children,

for their whole power and strength, shall fayle theym at one tyme and season, & theyr mariage shoulde haue lytle ioye or pleasure, yf the one were fruitfull, and the other feble for age. All thys haue I sayde after the mynde and opinion of the Philosophers, but speciallye of Aristotle in hys booke of the common wealthe. But yet in these thinges the causes why they dyd so define the thynge, are more to be considered and lo ked vpon, then the definition. Or elles when soeuer anye other lyke causes, or the selfe same (the whiche certes are verye good) doe perswade it. Lette vs perceyue & vnderstande that all

ready nature vath defined it, the which hauing respecte to the time and place, doth with secrete qualities alter mans body. But first we must consider reason and pitie, the only goodnes of the mind. And for the time that we liue chaste & vnmaried, we must vse such a waner and measure of liuing yt before the iust age of procre ation, we be not much pricked nor stirred with the flesh. Caesar

But she that is younge may euen as it were waxe be fashioned & formed, to what soeuer a man will fashion her vnto. In parentage and kinred let vs remembre the olde prouerbe, that of a good mother cometh a good doughter. My countreye men pronounce that with two senses, thus. Of a good vine take a good braunche, & to thy wife take the doughter of a good mother. And wanderynge aboute the citie, firste inquire thou of the mother, and then of the doughter.

a virgyn or corrupt, wont to be loued or no. In a wyddowe, her age must be cōsidered. In a yong woman it ma keth no greate matter whether she be a virgyn or no, althoughe it seeme no smale thynge to haue had the flower of her age, and as Uir gil doeth say, to haue had th firste loue. Nor it is not of naughte that my countrey men prouerbiallye doe saye: that the begynnynge, as wel in loue as in

                  otage is moste pleasaunte. In her that was longe with her husband, that thyng, the which of wise men is commaunded to be wayed in frendes, muste be considered, that is, how she behaued her selfe to her firste husbāde

and what maner of man her husband was. For if she (he be ing an honest man) loued him not, nor could not broke him, waie then with thy self, what she wil be vnto thee: but yf he wer euyl and importune, and yet she moderatly dyd suffer him, thou must euer hope and trust the same. But yf he wer euyll & flagitious, then thou muste take good heede whether he haue not allured her vnto his owne maners, and how those maners doe please the. Make also a comparison betwixte him and thy selfe, for yf he wer more vertuous then thy selfe, she considering the good thinges past & those that are present, shalbe heauy and greuous vnto the, and so

much the more, because yt the time presēt semeth to be worse, then that, yt is paste, for theTyme. time doth cōtinually turne & incline to ye worse. But yf she be better borne, richer, and of more power then yu thy selfe, she as one yt was some times maryed to suche an husbande vnto whō thou arte not to be compared, shal fastidiously cō
                  tempne thee, & the more bitterly hate thee. howe muche her first husband then thou, dyd more commodiously and gently vse her. But she yt shal come laden to the wt childrē, shal rob thee, & gather to enriche her owne withall. She wyll not loue thy chyldren, nor yet equallye those, which are common betwene you,

but shal haue compassion vpō the fatherles being destitute of al fatherlye helpe and com forte. In her that was corrupte men must consider the lyfe that is paste, for of these ther are two periculous kindes, for thou shalte heardlye perswade her that was common, or her that hathe haunted the companye of greate men, or her the whiche they haue loued to be continente: for it would be heard for her that was wonte and accustomed to be a maistres ouer great men, to serue him that is so farre vnder those which wer her seruātes. And how soeuer she shal find the, she wil not beleue that al other wold haue ben as thou art, but shal

lament that so vnluckedly she came & was maried vnto the. I wold not counsel yt to maryExcellēte good con̄

Thys submission is & shoulde be the cause, yt she doth not regard yt, but disdayneth to serue thee, whose ladye she was as she estemed, & whō she foūd more obedient vnto her, euen with yt peril & daunger of life, thē a ny other slaue yt was bought for monie. Thus it appeareth

it is not conuenient ye the seruaunt should rule ye maistres, for after yt loue, hatred, reuerence, contempt, & feare hath once occupied the mind of mā they leaue certayne cōtinuall markes, the which ye Grekes call Hexis, & the Latins Habitus. Great & noble men do alwayes honour their pedagoges & maisters, & that for the reuēce they bare thē of youth & do feare them, notwithstan ding they be their subiectes, & haue the aucthoritie & power in their hand bothe of life and deathe. And the prouerbe doth saye, that whoso marieth for loue, dothe liue in sorow. I wold yt the flame whiche was kindled & did burne before they were married, & after they were married, waxed

cold agayne might be renued, perpetual, pure, & liuelye. Thou seeste nowe, howe great prudency & wisdome is necessary to discerne & iudge these thinges, and how necessary it is to counsel with him, whose motions of the minde are quiete, that they begile thee not. Let no man trust to obtayne a wife, yt shal haue no incommoditie nor faute, but yet the fewer yt she hath, shall be in stede & place of her mani fold & great vertues. But he yt is wise, wil learne & take cō sel by such thinges as be present.

And therefore al thinges are to be reuoked & called to that supreme and exact iudgemēt of the mind. Thou shalt take hede, that on thy part the wo man nother in body nor in sub stāce be not deceaued, for thou shalt neuer vse her cōinodiously, and as thou wouldest thy selfe, whome thou fraudulent ly & deceytfully diddest intice & wind vnto thee, for natural ly we hate him as an enemy, yt doth begile vs, nor nothynge doth displease a manne more, then to lacke the thinge he loked for. It were better to disclose vnto her thy vices & infirmities, the mediocrity and meanes of thy goodes & substance with the perill of ye losse of her, then to obtayne her wt
                  
fraude & sure discord. SergiusSergius Gal ba, Galba his father yt was Empe rour playde (as it is written) the parte of a wise & of an honest man, for when Liuia Occel la that beautifull & riche woman was in loue with him, he put of his clothes, & secretlye did shew her that he was bro ken backte, the which simple gene rositie did so contente & please her, that she regarded not the blemishe of his bodye, but loued and honoured him more, thē euer she did before. Many men are wont to saye, yt they will rule their wiues, whatsoeuer they be, or howsoeuer they came by thē, and that it is in the hande and power of the husband, what and of what conditions she shall

be. Certes a greate parte of this doth rest & lye in the husband, so that he as he oughte to do, do vnderstand that maMatrimony. trimonye is the supreme and most excellent part of all amitie, and that it farre differreth from tiranny, the which doth compell men to obeye.

               And yet surelye they are but very fooles, that iudge matri mony to be a dominion. And such as woulde be feared, do afterwardes lamente & complayne that they find no loue

in them, whose loue & amite through their owne importu nitie thei turned into hatred. And at ye beginnynge glorifiing & craking thus cruelly to be their wiues maisters, thei purchase vnto them selues a most miserable & alamentble life in time to come, beinge nowe yt all loue & pleasure is caste a side, enuironed with feare & suspition, hatred, & so row. Truly yf a man (as nature,Eph. v. reason, & holy scripture, do saye vnto vs) be the head of the woman, and Christ the father, there ought to be betwene them such societe & felowship, as is betwene ye father and the sonne, and not suche as is betwene the maister and the seruaunt.
            
            
               
               ¶ Of the accesse and goynge vnto Mariage.
               AFter yt thou hast de termined with thy self to marry, & hast done all dilygence therto required, thou muste desire of God, good & prosperous successe, in whose hand & power it is to gene it, & doutles wil geue it most abūdantly, if thou aboue al other thin ges haue an hope & a respect vnto him, For yf thou, after ye thou hast satisfied thine appetite, resort vnto him, desiring him yt thou mayst obtayn the thing that thou most desirest, it shuld apeare yt thou wouldest make hym a minister of thy voluptuous desieres and

pleasures, and so doynge thy vowes & prayers should appere most manifest blasphemy A man should not come vntoNote mariage as vnto a prophane thinge, with a solute and an vncareful mynde, but with a quiet & a wel pourged mynd, as to a thinge most sacrate & holye. Nor matrimony doth not onely consiste in the coniunction of the body, nor yet in daunsyng nor bancketing, procedynge & broughte vnto vs with many other thinges from the gentiles, when that it shoulde rather beseme vs most studiously to pray vnto almyghty God, that so wayghtye a thyng as matrimonye is, myghte haue good and prosperous successe.
               
                  Matrimonie as a thing sanctified of God, the which willeth the matrimonial embracemētesHe, xiij to be chaste, the bed to be vndefiled, and their pro ginie vnbespotted. And it is after the mind of S. Paule, a signe of that great mistery, wherwith Christ doeth indisolubly vnite hym self vnto yt
                  Eph. v. church. Therfore thou ough test as much as shal lye in the to lift vp thy mind, and to remembre howe great & howe worthy an ymage thou doest represent, and that thy wife is vnto thee, as the churche, and thou vnto her as Christ: And therefore thou shouldest shewe thy selfe vnto her as Christ shewed him self vnto his churche. The charite

and loue of Christe vnto the churche is incredible, and thy loue towardes thy wyfe ought to be most effectuous. Societe and to liue together is the most effectuous and su rest knot to knitre and ioyne amitie and loue amonge men and all other beastes. What greater societie or companye can there be, then is betwene a man and his wyfe? Whose house, whose chambre, whose bed is cōmon, their chyldren are common, and they theim selues partakers of al good & euyl successe and fortune, the which societie and felowshyp wer sufficiēt to styre and pro uoke him that loueth not his wyfe, to loue and beneuolence. And what companye

or loue shall a manne loke to haue of him that loueth not his wyfe? Ther are yt in loue and amite loke for gaine as yt vile Epicures do, vnworthy to be beloued, menne whiche loue them selues & not their frēdes. And if we haue a respecte vnto commoditie and profite, there is nothing that geueth so muche as doeth a wyfe, no not horses, oxen, fermers nor proctours. For a mans wyfe is the felowe and conforter of all cares & thoughtes, and doeth moore diligent and good seruice, then other mayde or seruaunt, the which do serue men for feare or els for wages, but thy wif is led onely by loue, & therefore, she doth euery thing bet ter then all other. And God

doth declare it, saying: let vsGen. ij. make Adam a helper lik vnto him selfe, by the helper is signified the vtilitie and profite of the seruice, & by the similitude & likenes is signified loue. For a seruaūt and he that is hired, are far vnlike ye maister, and are taken wel nyghe for no men. A seruaunt in the stede and place of an horse or of an oxe, ye whiche must be betē & inforsed to their work doeth serue his maister. A hired seruaūte is in ye place of an hired horse, for whē ye hier is payed, ye socitie & felowship dissolueth. The child is part of ye father, & through a natural pitie thei loue eche other, but yet ye wife is more annexed & ioyned to her husband.

The father doth labour and taketh paine for his childrē, but sildome the children for theyr fathers, and often tymes thei are sent to inhabite & dwel in other mens houses wherby in a maner it appeareth that their strayte & faste societe doth dissolue & break. But the wife cleane contrary doth incontinently take paines for her husband, nor may (as long as she liueth) nother chaūge house nor bed. If com moditie & profit be loked for, what cōmoditie excelleth this yf yu loue thy wife yu shalt liue most pleasantly, yf yu loue her not, most miserablye & wretchedly. For ther is nohing so sharpe nor so bitter, as to hate the thing yt doth fauor & loue

the, nor nothing more happy as to loue him that hateth ye. What doth other mens bene uolence & amitie helpe or cō
                  fort me, yf inwardlye I consume my selfe with hatred? or what doth other mens enuye & hatred hurte me, when my mind is occupied with swete & pleasaunt loue? The fountayne of felicitie & miserye is inwardly, for outward thinges do litle or nothing to the iocunditie or miserye of mans life. Some there be, that hate aungels, the whiche that notwithstandinge are throughe loue most happy & fortunate. Some other loue Sathan, ye which through enuy and hatred are moste vnfortunate & wretched. How shal it be possible

then, that thou whiche doste loue shalt not be loued, the prouerbe being true and saying: Loue that thou maist be loued. Thou shalte then leade a celestiall & a heauenly life, when there is such correspondente & mutuall loue betwene you. as there is amōg the aungels and those blessed foules, whiche haue left theyr dodies, and are clothed with the diuine and godly lyghte. The lawe of matrimony andThe law of loue is matrimony. nature, whiche Idam or God rather by Adā did pronunce, doth declare how greate the loue of mariage should be, for when Eue after that swete slumber was broughte vnto him to be his wife & companiō behold (quod) Adā this bone

                     . of my fleshe, for this shal man for sake father and mother, & cleue vnto his wife, and they shal be two in one fleshe. This is the summe and ende of all loue & amitie, to be so ioyned with the thing that thou dost loue that thou mayst become one thing with it. The Poetes declare, that Vulcanus the God of smithes founde two together, the whiche shewed one to another great tokens of loue, and taking a pleasure in this their charitie & loue, a thing vnto god most acceptable, he asked them whether there were any thing, where in he mighte do thē pleasure. O Vulcane qd they, we desire yt wtthose thi diuine instrumētsNote
                  
wouldeste breake vs in peaces, cast vs newe agayne, and make of vs two but one.
               This is the ende of al our desires, & for this doth loue study, & shal obtayne that it desireth, yf it may bring yt thynge to passe, the whiche at lengthe shal be in that heauenlye loue and charitie, when we being spoyled of this fleshe of sinne, and renued by Christe, shalbe made one thing with God, & among our selues, as Christe dothe teache vs. What other thinge is it, yt man must leaue father & mother for and cleueGene. ij vnto his wife, but only yt charity ouercometh al loue, yea & yt also which doth elaspe the fa ther & the childe together, yt oughte to be mooste greatest.

beyng a man taught onlye by nature doth saye, as Homere writeth, that Troy in time to come shuld be destroyed by yt Grekes, and that he doth not care nor sorowe so muche for him selfe, his father, his mother, or for his brethren, as he soroweth for his dearly beloued wife. The stoute & manly mind of man hath continually his reward: for why? the flame pearseth the womans hearte, the whiche loueth her husband most feruently. And so dyd Andromica loue Hector aboue al other. Zenophō
                   doth shewe, that when Tygraue the king of Armenias sonne & hys wife were Cyrus prisoners, he promised to redeme her with his owne life. And afterwardes

whē they asked her what she thought of Cyrus, she sayd yt she neuer behelde nor sawe him. And when her husband sayd, what thinge haste thou sene then, yf thou neuer didste see him? she aunswered, what thing shuld I beholde or see, but him only, yt sayd he wolde redeme me out of seruitute & bondage with his owne life? so greatly the loue of her husband had inflamed her. But what maner of loue should be in matrimony? & with what other preceptes shoulde it be fashyoned, then with those, yt whyche the Lorde our God dothe geue by hys Apostle Paule in the Epystle to the Ephesians where he sayeth:Cap. v. That manne is the heade of

the woman, as Christe is the1. Cor. iij. heade of the churche, and god the heade of Christ. He propo neth no vile thing, nor of erth lye wisdome, that dothe corrupt, and is foolishnes before God, and oftentimes in thys world doth decaye, & yet doth eleuate and extoll it selfe to the similitude and ymage of the eternall wisedome, by the which the almightie god created & made the world. And that heade of the churche said so seriouslye, that he was the saluation of his bodye, that he doubted not to giue hym selfe for it. The Apostle calleth vpon hys, to ensue and folowe thys loue, thatEphe. v is, that as CHRISTE hathe sprynckled and shedde

his bloud to saue his churche so shuldest thou not feare, nor that for thine or thy wifes affections, but for the helth and salute of her soule, to die most stronglye. What thinge canLoue geneth courage. make the coragious, yf loue make the not? the whiche geueth courage & audacitie to hartes, hares, & other timerous and fearfull beastes. In this worde salute is comprised, life, helth, vertue & honestye. But as for riches, ornamentes, delitiousnesse, vayne glory & voluptuousnes are ta ken for foolishnes. He hym self despised al these thinges, & taught his, that they shuldNote this come vnto him, yf they lightly regarded them. Christ dyd not to enriche his churche wt
                  
golde and siluer, or that it shoulde be of solace or pleasure, but he was crucified to sanctifie his churche with wa ter by ye worde, that it myght be glorious withoute anye wrynkle or sporte, holye and faulteles, and so oughte men to loue their wyues as their owne bodyes. The Lord doethEph. v. dayly sanctifie the church by hys death, that being purged with the mooste purest bloude of her spouse, she may be adourned with all vertue, and by puttynge awaye olde Adam with all his deedes, she maye be clothed wyth Christe her spouse, the which was made of God after the similitude and lykenes of the first Adam, I say, the heauenly,

not after the ymage of the earthly. There appeare outwardly suche wonderful and excellēt vertues, wherof the glorye of the churche doeth aryse, that by them they may come to the fountayne of all goodnes, that do meruaile at those sprynges, and doth honour them. And therfore we are commaunded to be in eueii. co. ij ry place a good odour and sauour, but namelye vnto the lord. And it is the wyl of our maister that oure good workesMat. v. shoulde be knowen to all men to the intent our heauen lye father of whom we receyued thē, might be glorified.
               The quene did stand vpō the right hand of her spouse, in aPsalm xliiij. vesture of golde wrought aboute wt diuers colours, but

yet her glory was not in her apparel, nor in those thinges which mē do behold & se, but in those yt she seeth in sprite, & that her spouse doth approue for whose loue she doeth adourne & apparel her self: who thē can esteme matrimony to be vile, consideringe it is yt ymage of so high and so diuine thinges? And therfore ye womās life, vertue, & good name & fame, oughte to be vnto her husband more derer then his own life, as christ put his own life to great & incredible paines & tormētes to saue, sāctifie, & to honor his church, Nor yu must not behold how fayre, of what kinred, how rich, or of what healthe she is of, nor yet howe greatlye she doeth loue

thee: for whatsoeuer she be ye thou haste maried, thou must none other wyse, nor with no lesse affection loue her, then Christ loued his churche, the whiche refused not to suffer great paynes for the wicked, and his enemies, drawynge them vnto him as membres vnto the head, to furnish and to make vp his churche with al, he doeth dayly teache her, sustayneth, clarifieth, mundifieth, and with greate pacience & gentlenes doeth chasten her, and whatsoeuer she be, he embraseth her wt great loue, although she be vnkind, and coldely doth recompence his feruent loue and charite, to her wardes. She is thy wyfe, and ye bothe are nowe

but one thing, therfore thou oughtest to loue her as thy selfe. It is written that Epaminudas enemies appoynted him a certayne vile off

loueth his wif. Nor ther was neuer man yt hated his owne flesh, but doth norish & cherish it, as the lord doth cherish his church, Aristotle folowing the Pithagorians doth define a frēd that he is the self same thyngA frende with another. And god doth saye, yt the wife with her husbandGene. ij is al one thing. And Cicero to cōfirme & kepe amitie geueth this counsel, that the inferior shuld ascend & the superior descend, for so yt things may be brought to equalitie. But in matrimonye this nedeth not, for it is sufficiente both for yt man & the wyfe, to perceyue & vnderstand, that they are parte eche of others bodye. And therefore to be fayre or foule, ryche or poore,

noble or ignoble, whole or sicke, wyse or folyshe, is nowe throughe the operation and work of God, the which hath made them bothe one, common vnto them bothe. Nor there shall neuer be true and cōtinual loue, except it be stablyshed vpon those thynges that remayne after death.
               For beauty, ryches, kinred, & suche other haue their tyme, some appoynted by nature, & some by fortune, & other humaine chaūces. Thei haue also their sacietie, & in time and place thei are forgotten. For we can not at all tymes and seasons remember the Fabians, the Cornelians, and that we receyued a greate dowrye. The affection with the

tyme doth waxe feble & cold, and the plentifulnes and vse of that, that a man dyd gredely fyrst desyre doeth cause him to lothe it. Al these thinges do diminishe loue, & certē of thē do vtterly extinguishe it, the which if it had bene in the mind & in vertue, shouldeVertue. haue continued for euer. For vertue is euer at hand, neuer ydle, neuer vnprofitable nor voide, but alwayes working. Nor yt soule of mā by ye death of the bodye doeth not die, so that we may beleue that thei whiche be departed doe loue all suche, as in thys worlde were deare vnto theym: and that they whyche loued the Soules of those whyche bee departed and

deliuered from the bodye, do loue them not as deade, but as they loue their frendes, yt which are absent & farre frō them. And therfore we do see many women that kepe their fayth & loue vnto their firste husbandes, as did Demotions the Ariopagites doughter, of the which S. Hierome doth write agaynste Iouiniane, the whiche after that her spouse Leostenes was deade, wouldeNote. this ye women. mary with none other, saying that she should marry an aduouterer & no husband, for although he wer departed, yet he was aliue vnto her. And so sayd that womā of Rome. And how sharpely & wittelye doth Lucane bring in Cornelia, Scipio Metellus doughter, and

                  Pompeus last wife, taking and esteminge her selfe but as an harlot as touchinge Iulia hys first wife, as though the knot and band of matrimonye and loue did yet indure bet wixte the liuing and deade. And naturally euery man desireth to be loued and doth searche for the fauour of other men, and studieth to kepe & to encrease those thinges, that cause hym to be in fauour. If thy wife do perceaue, that thou art rauished and taken with her beau tie, and would that thou shuldest loue her, she wil do al her diligence to encrease & augmente it, yf with her communication. she will neuer cease pratling, yf with her vertue, she wil dayly labor howe in all

honest & vertuous dedes she maye be better. By as one of the seuen wise & sage men of Grece, gaue this one precept
                     By as precepte. & rule of loue. Loue so sayth By as, yt thou mayste hate, and hate yt thou mayst loue. I can not saye, whether this wyse man doth more folowe the figure of wordes, then yt truth of the sentence, inasmuche as he dothe teache, that no man shuld be to other, nother faith full frende nor enemye. And therefore Cicero doeth saye full truelye, that all amitye and frendshyppe shoulde decaye, yf a manne shoulde loue so, that he maye hate. What shoulde he truste then? what shuld he beleue, or to whome shoulde he open hys mynde?

or how shuld he loue him tru ly and with al his heart, whē he may coniectute and thynk that in time to come he wil be or may by his enemy? surelye he will drawe backe, and prouide agaynst such thinges, as may fortune & chaunce. And therefore this sentence maye thus more cōuenientlye both for the vse of nature & of this life be turned. Loue neuer to hate, but hate to loue when time shal be. Euery man shuld loue his frend simply, but speciallye his wyfe. And forasmuche as loue & other affectes are named of the Philosophers Habitus, the whiche are conserued and kept in vs through time, operation, and labour, we muste euen at the

beginning geue our diligēce, that all iniuries and offences maye be auoyded: for as Plutarke doth saye, tender & softe loue is sone broken. TherforeThe beginninge of matrimoniall loue. that newe loue & coniunction of the mind, must be nourished with benigne, swete & gentle conuersation, vntil it be so increased & fastened, yt no great storme be able to dissolue or breake it. And al suspitiō must be at all times, but specially at the beginning of matrimony auoyded, lest thou firste begin to hate, or euer thou beginne to loue. And beware thou fayne it not, nor conceaue it of no light occasions & coniectures, for vnto suche thou shouldeste geue no eare, although there were great apparence

& liklyhode. Ther is no man so well fashioned and brought vp, that can satisfye all men, and he that was able to auoyde the faute, was not able to auoyde suspition, for ye iudgementes of men are free and licentious, & they do interprete, yt they see and heare, not after the truth, but after their affections, and the coniecture that they do fayne & reioyce in, vnto the whiche some do geue more credite, then some. Pansanias in platose Simpose doth put two Venus &
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . loues. two loues, a heauenly and an earthly. The earthly is blind abiect, vyle, fyithye, and occupyed aboute vile and filthye thinges, neuer lokynge vp to thinges of more worthines.

But that celestiall and heauēly loue doth see most cleare lye, folowyng vertue & those thynges, whiche are mooste beautifull, and moost lyke vnto heauenlye thinges. Those husbandes that loue the beau tye, or the ryches of their wiues, are blynde and subiecte to that earthly loue, not perceauinge the reason nor yet the measure therof. But thei whiche are true husbandes,True hus bandes. loue the soule and vertue, and haue a iudgemente in loue, and beyng inspired wyth the strengthe and spirite of that celestiall loue, do loue wyselye: for pure and holye loue dothe not vyolentlye compel them, as that doeth whyche is earthlye, but prudentelye

doth guyde, and conduct thē gently perswaded to ye place they shuld go vnto. The wise husbande doth loue his wyfe feruentlye, but yet as the father loueth his sonne, ye head, the body, the soule, the fleshe, and as Christe dothe loue his churche, & thus must the husbande & the wife loue eche other. Nature it felfe dothe teache vs this, & they lykewise that are learned in diuine letters do tel vs ye same. Adam was firste created likeGene. ij iij. vnto the ymage & similitude of his maker. But when he perceaued that it was not cō
                  uenient nor mete, yt he should liue alone, a helpe like vnto him selfe was geuen him, and taken euen oute of hys owne

side, insomuche that Adam is to Eue, as the father is vnto his sonne. And it was said to Eue, thou shalte be vnder the power of man, & he shall rule thee. Nor it is not thus only in man, but in al kindes & sortes of beastes, yt the female is vnder the power & dominion of the male, and therefore the male is more stronger bothe in mind & bodye, then the female. And the instrumentes to rule withall, are more excellente and more perfecte in manne, then in womanne, as the sharpenes of witte, diligence, wisedome, strength, audacitie, generositie, and yt excellencie of the minde. And therfore yt Romaynes folowing nature, did neuer take the

whole auctoritie of man from women. Liuius vsinge ye wordes of Cato, dothe saye thus. Our forefathers would not, that women shoulde do anye thing without the auctoritye of man, submittinge them selues to their fathers, to theyr brothers & to their husbandes. Matrimonye is called a coniunction and a cōparison, but yet they are not like, as Martial doth saye merelye, except the woman be vnlike the man. O Sexte (sayth Martial) let the woman be vnder her husband, and so they shalbe lyke.
               It is sufficient, yt the husband loue his wife with a sightiye loue, but the wife is bounde vnto her husband in two thin ges, that is to loue him, & to

do him reuerence, the whicheLoue & reuerence affections can not be constray ned, but yet they maye be obned of her by gentlenes. But this thing can not be done wt woordes, but as he sayeth: Marke, yf thou wilt be loued, loue. They which are learned do think, that this thing doth not happen by chaūce medle, but by the secrete artifice of the world. The Philosopher Plato doth say, that the whole worlde is so compacte and bounde together by God the artificer, as it were with certayne knottes, for yf thou drawe or take one of them, the other by a certayne secrete coniunction, as it were the lynckes of a cheyne do folowe, but yet he sayeth, that

those thinges, which are like & most cōformable one to the other, are most speciallye ioyned together, & that beneuolence doth grow of the similitude & likenes of nature and custome, and that they which loue, are loued agayne. And this loue must be pure and sin cere, or elles it shall haue no strength nor none effect. Fire paynted vpon a wal doth not burne, nor a false adamante draweth no yron. Many men do maruayl, why they are not loued, seinge they do shewe so many tokēs & signes of loue. The signes & tokens of loue are not loue, & therefore they cause not the effecte of loue, but prouoke & cause hatred, when it is perceaued, yt they

loued not, but fained so many tokens and diuerse signes of loue. Loue also doth growe of the opinion of honestie, for as Cicero dothe saye, there is nothinge more amiable, nor yt draweth the minde of manne more to loue then vertue. AllWhat loue is. loue is a certayn affection to yt thing, that is goodly & fayre, there is nothing more goodly then vertue, the which yf a man might behold & see with his bodely eyes, would stirre vp great loue vnto it self, but it is seene with the inwarde eye of the mind, and draweth those that beholdeth it to beneuolence, & to embrace and loue it. The opinion of excellencie, the whiche is situate & set other in the power of the

body, or of yu soule, doth bring forth, & ingender veneration,Ueneration. and reuerence. Strength, riches, frendes, clientes, seruauntes, ministers, subiectes fauour, grace, and dignitie, be longe vnto the bodye. In the soule are iudgement, wisdom, the sharpenes of witte, sagacitie, watche, fortitude, & audacitie, wherby men do take vpon them great actes & enterprises. Of these thingesMaiestre doth maiestie procede & arise, by the which al thinges vpon earthe are ruled & gouerned. And with this, kinges and magistrates gouerne and defende great nations and king domes, and throughe thys, greate multitudes and number of people do obeye vnto

the will of one alone: wyth this captaynes & Emperors do conducte, whether soeuer they wil greate companies & hostes of menne. Of this the mayster hathe neade for hys seruaunte, the father for hys sonne, and the husbande for hys wife, to thende she maye loue and obeye hym that is wise, for prudeneye and wisdome wythoute honestie and goodnesse is formidable, and goodnes without wisdom is loued, but not obeied. In this maiestie doth consist the force & strength of iustice both to re ward & to punishe. It shalbe sufficiēt for an husbād to haue of these thinges so muche as shal suffice to rule his wife & his family withall. Other mē
                  
haue nede of power, & also of maiestie to rule a citie, in the which are so manye houses & housholdes. The foundation of al thinges is fayth, ye whichFayth. is most certaynly obtayned & gotten by science. The nexte vnto fayth is, to be hadde in good estimation. Marcus Cato
                  Note (as Salust doeth write) dyd laboure rather to be good, then to appeare good: & therfore the lesse he sought for glo rye, the more he obtayned it. Those opinions are wont to be most surest and fast, yt which
                     
                        •
                     ayth do occupye the yong & tender minde, as we do see by those thinges, that children do first learne and commende to memorye. Nor wolle doth neuer loose hys firste coloure,

nor that clothe the which (as it is commonlye spoken) is died in wolle. And therfore, we ought not only to labour and studye to brynge in good affections, but we muste so dispose and order the whole state of oure lyfe, that it maye be the more easie to be borne, and throughe conuersation waxe more swete and pleasaunte. Thou muste also consider thyne owne wytte and qualities, and lykewyse thy wyues, and thy ryches and substaunce, and prouide that it maye prosper, not onely for the tyme and state presente, but also for the tyme that is to come. And thus considerynge the casualties of man, thou muste dispose the thyng

in suche wyse, that not great chaūge or chaūce mai trouble the soft & delitate mind of the woman, notwithstandyngei. pe. v. that chaunces are infinite, & that no prouision can be foūd to withstande them, and that many of them must be referd vnto God, the whiche taketh care for vs al, & wuld that we shoulde not care for the thinges that are to come, the whi che pertayne to hym onelye, nor no man can make prouision agaynst them. But now to retourne to oure purpose, when thou goest a wowyng, thou muste beware and take heede (that thou whether the woman be promysed the, or nowe brought home vnto the) geue not thy self to those vnmete & voluptuous loue &

lustes, by the whiche men are compelled to sai & to do many thinges which are filthy and childish. And of this loue the prouerbe doth saye, that it is scarcely graunted to God, to loue & to be wise: loue & wine are in thy power or euer thou drinke, but after yt thou haste dronken, yu shalte be their subiect & seruaunte. And of this she shal iudge the to be vaine, light, vnapt, and folishe. Nor thou canst not kepe thy maiestie in such filthy loue: for Ouide doth say, that maiesty & loue doeth not agree, nor remain nor tary not in one place. But ye poet doth speake of this erthly and blind loue, for cordiall and wyse loue doeth not diminishe maiestye.
               
                  Nor a woman can not suffer nor take hym for her maister, that was some tyme her seruaunt. And the weaker a wo man is in mynde, the more she desyreth to be in power, and yf she had once domination and rule, she taketh it as an iniurie, yf she rule not styl. Nor there is no rule mooreNote violente or moore greuous, then theirs, that by al reason ought to be subiectes, as the rule of seruauntes, artificers children and women. But as we woulde that the man whē he loueth shoulde remember his maiestye, so we woulde that when he ruleth he forget not hys loue, nor to temper it with maiestye. And when he doth thinke him selfe

to be the head and the soule, and the woman as it wer the fleshe & the bodye. He oughte in lyke manner to remembre, that she is hys felow & compa nion of his goods & labours, and that their children be cō
                  mon betwene theym, bone of bones, and fleshe of the fleshe of man. And thus ther shalbe in wedlocke a certayne swete and pleasaunt conuersation, withoute the whiche it is no maryage but a prysone, a hatred & a perpetual torment of the mynde. Let thy wyfe per ceyue and knowe that for the good opinion that thou haste of her, yt doest loue her simply and faythfullye, and not for anye vtilite or pleasure. For who so doeth not perceyue

that he is beloued for hys owne sake, wyl not lightly do the same to another, for the thynge that is loued, loueth agayn. If money or nobilitie coulde perceyue and vnderstande that they were beloued, they woulde yf they had anye felynge at all of loue, requite it with loue: but when the soule is loued, inasmuche as it maye loue, it geueth loue for loue, and loueth agayne. The Breaker of horsses that doeth vse to ride and to pace theym, doeth handle the rough and sturdy colte with all crafte & fearcenes that maye be, but with it that is more tractable, he taketh not so greate payne. AA sharpe wyfe. sharpe wyfe muste be pleased

and mitigated with loue, and ruled wyth Maiest ye: & the more gently thou doest vse & shew thy self vnto her that is meke and honest, themore beninge and meke thou shalte finde her. But she that is noble and of a stoute mynde and stomake, the lesse thou doest looke to be honoured, the more she wyll honoure thee. But yet the wyse husbande shall neuer sette hym selfe so farre in loue, that he forgette that he is a man, the ruler of the house, and of hys wyfe, and that he is set as it were in a Station to watche, and delygentlye to take heede, what is done in hys house, and to see who goeth oute and in.
               
                  A shepherd had nede to be industrious and diligent, but he much more that hath the orderynge & keping of man, the whyche is so variable a beast, & so intractable. Yf so be that the husbande haue obtayned that his wyfe doth truly and heartely loue hym, there shal nede nother preceptes nor lawes, for loue shall teache her moe thinges and more effectuously, thē the preceptes of al the Philosophers. And for

                  There is made no lawe for him that loueth, for to what intent should they make anye lawe, when that loue euen na turallye doth moue a man to loue? There is no lawe made for the father agaynst yt child, but wel for the child agaynste the father, for the father doth continuallye loue the childe, but the child doth now & thē leaue of to loue the father. If the wife loue her husband, he is to her a father, mothcr, bre thren, true riches, & all that she wil desire. Fortunate andO fortunate ho

thing is there in this life that maye be compared with one daye of so blessed & so heauenly a life? Galenus was maryed with Sulpitia, the which amōgSulpitia. all the Matrones of Rome, was most chast and beste learned: of the which mariage Mar tial doth write in this wise & maner. O Galene howe pleasannt were those. xv. yeares, that the Lorde did geue thee with Sulpitia thi wife? O note it, and nowe note it well with a white stone, in the which all thy age & yeares are cōprised: And yf Parca had geuen thee such another day, thou wouldeste haue counted thy selfe muche more happye, then to haue liued as longe, as Pilius Nestor. And finally ther shuld

be such cōcorde betwene man & wife, as god hath made betwene heauen & earth, by the which so great a varietie and multitude of beastes & trees is produced & ingēdred. And therfore it must be wayd & cō
                  sidered, whether ye woman do loue simply and faithfully, for as fire doth kindle fire, so doeth loue prouoke loue, & one flame augmenteth another. This thing sayth Seneca, hath in it self great ioye & reward: for what canne be so ioyfull or pleasant, as to be so louing vn to thy wife, yt therby yu mayst loue thi self ye better? If there be any thing amōg these thin ges of fortune, that the trusteth vnto, or loueth so well, that she despyseth and lytle

regardeth her husbande, because she hath it not, or prefer reth her selfe aboue him, because she hathe it, that thinge must be layd apart & contemned, as a thing rather accepted & estemed by the foolish opinion of man, then of it one proper & naturall goodnesse. Beautie is a frayle gift and a slipperous, and more profitableBeautye to those that behold it, thē to those that haue it: nor he can take no great pleasure in it, but a litle as it were in a glasse, and yet incontinent he doth forgette yt he beheld and sawe, and it is to them both a prouocation to euill. He that is fayre waxeth proude, and he yt doth behold it, becometh subiecte vnto filthie loue. In

the minde (the whiche is iudged to be the man) do consiste the true liniamētes of fayrenes, the which intice and prouoke celestiall loue, beinge mixt with nothing yt is shame ful other to be done or spokē, & therfore there is no man so farre without witte, yt rather would not haue her which is foule & honest, then her which is fayre and vnhonest. Thou mayst sone declare, that thou doest not greatlye esteme ryches, yf thou be contente with that thou hast hauing wherewith al to get thy liuing, & be ing content to support pouertie with a litle, for why? the ende of riches, is to satisfie na ture, the which is cōtent withRiches. a litle. I wold not yt thou shul

And as touching herKinred. kinred, whatsoeuer it be, yet yt husbande ought euermore to be estemed more noble then yt wife. Nor she must not consider what his father was, but what her husbād is, of whom both she & her child take their nobilitie & ignobilitie, for no man shuld trust, or haue anye confidence in any other mans vertue. For we al are of yt self same elemenres, & god is father vnto vs al: & therfore it shuld be a very wicked thing, that christen men which haue layd awaye olde Adam, & are

baptised with the bloude of Christe, & by his death made new creatures, shuld regard their bodely & fleshly kinred: for they shuld now liue in spirite, named christians, & resto red by Christ to their natiue nobilitie, from the which al hu mayne generation was fallē through sinne. In this nobilitie, the which is oures only, the Grekes do not glorye of their wittes, nor the Iewe of the earthly promise of Canaan, nor of their circumcision, nor the Romayns of their triumphes and conqueste of all the world, but the christiā, which is the spiritual and the celesti al manne only. And therfore yf it be a filthye and an inconueniente thynge for manne

to seke glorye of his kinred, how muche more filthie & inconueniente is it for the woman, the which glory nowe a dayes is not gotten by vertue,How no bilitie & glorye is gotten. but by the heapinge vp of riches, or els in warre by mur der, thefte, & cruelnes, as the Gotes thoro wout al Spayne, the whiche thinges in manne are abhominable, & so muche the lesse conuenient for womē vnto whome euen of nature warre & armour are denied. Many thinges might copiously be spokē of beautie, riches, eloquence, and of kinred, the which I haue breuelye cōprised, because I wold not be onerous in thinges yt maye be easely found vnto the reader Use thy selfe so vnto thy wiues

frendes & parentes, that they maye haue asmuche com moditie and honour by thee, as thou mayst haue by them. There are that wyl say, that thou art not able to sustayne and vpholde thy familie and houshold without their helpe and succour, vse thou the com forte and helpe of no such, althoughe thou haue nede of theym, for it is better (after the mynde and the counsayle of the wyse man) at home toProu. xvij. eate browne bread wyth salt meate, then to be fed most delicately & dayntely wt brawling & bitter words.

And in all thy troubles & discentions wt thy wyfe, they oughte (as it is meete they shoulde) to suppoort and fauour thee, for yf they doe nat, they shall shewe thē selues vnwyse, and that thou haste no nede of no such frendes. Therfore seeke helpe and comfort of other in thy affayres and busynesses.

               ¶ Of the discipline and instruction of women.
               
                  THe lawes after my minde ought to be such, yt the citezins mai be wel manerd and haue wholsom doctrine. For if yt citie be wel instituted & gouerned, it shalbe no labor nor payne at al to cōmaūd thē nor to forbid them, nor it shall not greatly nede to feare thē with paines, nor wt rewards to prouokethē to liue wel: our flesh being infected & corrupted with sinne, & continually & inseperably vnited vnto the mind, doth first of al & principally offer vnto it selfe ye peruerse & euil opions of al thinges, & then as much as it mai doth fasten such thinges vnto it as be hurtefull aswell to the one secte as to the other.

And to extirpate and weede out such sinister opinions and iudgement, we haue nede of displine the whiche with the knowledge of good letters may easelye be obtayned and gotten. But it is now in question, whether it be expedientWhether it be necessarye that a wo man be 
                        •
                     erned. for a woman to be learned or no. Some there be that doe playnely deny it. But of this matter I haue euen wyth fewe woordes sufficientlye ynough disputed in my firste boke of a christen womā. And therfore I wyll only say here that shall be sufficient to confute that opinion the whiche I doe not alowe, and reproue those that of one sorte of letters geue iudgemente by another.
               
                  And in declaryng of that doctrine wherwith I woulde that the woman should be instructed & taughte, I thinke ther be but few yt wyll repine agaynst my mnid & sayinges. Ther be some kind of letters & writynges yt pertayue only to adourne & increase eloquence withall. Some to delite and please. Some that make a man subtile and craftye. Some to knowe naturall thynges, and to instruct and informe the mynde of mā withall. The workes of Poetes, the Fables of Milesij, as that of the golden asse, aud in a maner all Lucianes workes, and manye other whiche are written in the vulgar tonge, as of Trystram, Launcelote,

Ogier, Amasus and of Artur the whiche were written and made by suche as were ydle & knew nothinge. These bokes do hurt both man & woman, for they make them wylye & craftye, they kyndle and styr vp couetousnes, inflame angre, & all beastly and filthy desyre. So much knowledge of naturall thynges as suffiseth to rule & gouerne thys life withall, is sufficient for a woman. But all such workes as are meete & apte to make them better, are necessary as well for the one as for the other. A man of him self is nother good nor euyll, but yet through the firste faulte he is more inclined & prone to euil and cōmeth vnto it by examples

of many, the which haue conspired together to synne and to do mischiefe, for a man can turne his eye to no place, but he shall see the euyll that he maye ensue and folowe.
               Fyrst he is prouoked by their exhortations that seeme to counsel hym well, as Poetes, for suche thynges as they indite and make, are receyued and songe wythoute respect of thynges. And scolemaysters the whiche do teache and instructe youthe, are not farre from the opinion of the common people, for wyth them they prayse nobilite, riches, honour, veniaunce, and to these thynges they exhorte and instructe youthe.

Fathers and other parentesIs it not so? esteme the name of vertue as vayne, and accustome theyr chyldren to those thynges that flatter and delite the sen ses, and not to rigorous and hard honeste, as mē that loke to crepe no higher, but to liue with the vulgar and rude sorte, and yet woulde be an ex ample of lyuynge to al other. There are in like maner parentes which are graue men and well learned, and yet abhorre that vertue shuld associate and accompanye theyr children, the which perswade them to folowe pleasure, loue and solace, in asmuche that Quinciliane seynge that honestie and vertue is so conuenient and meete for our nature,

doth meruaile, that there are so few good men, but he shuld rather haue merueyled, that there are any good at al, considering their institution and bringing vp to be so euil. But yf by natural inclination, and by the comfort and aucthoritye of great and learned men we be enforced to euyll, nor drawen from it by some good doctrine, what hope is there of any goodnes? all shal come to mischiefe, and through the custome of synne, we shal hate all honestie, and learne to contemne the goodnesse of the mind, and to hate vertue. We shoulde stirre vp the figure & strength of reason, & receaue the loue of vertue, and geue the preceptes of wisdome agaynst

the corruption of false opinions, and by assue faction and vse resiste oure naturall proues, and inclination to vice, continuallye to the vtmost of our power, striuynge with the same. The woman is euen as man is, a reasonable creature, and hath a flexible witte both to good and euill, the whiche with vse and counsell maye be altered and turned. And althoughe there be some euyll and lewde womenne, yet that doth no more proue the malice of their nature, then of mē, and therfore the more ridiculous & foolish are they, that haue inuied agaynst yu whole sect for a fewe euil: & haue not with like fury vituperated al mankinde, because

yt part of thē be theues, & part inchaūters. And what a madnes were it to iudge, or to thinke yt the ignoraunce of good thinges shoulde cause a man to be ye better? although yt in the mind of manwere not great & thicke darckenes, letting him to behold & see that good is. for yt euill is, doth abound & is plentiful, and neadeth no teacher, nor doth not cōtinue as it entered, but gro weth by litle & litle, & so buddeth forth, yt it offendeth al other. Yf to read that good is helpe not, it shall not helpe to heare it or to see it: for men do not striue for the forme and fi gures of the letters, but for the sense and vnderstandyng in theym included.

Shal thy wife or thy doughter learne, howe to come her heere, adourne and paynt her selfe, perfume her gloues, to go pomposely, and with what wordes she shal vse to set forth her wantonnes, and her pride withal, & shal not heare nowe she maye flee and contemne suche trifles, adourne her mind, and please Christ? Art thou, o thou Christian of that mind? then thou dost affirme, that no fonde nor foolish gentile would at anye time haue beleued. Shal the womanne then be excluded from the knowledge of al that is good and the more ignoraunte she is, be counted better? Some there be so rude and dull, the whiche esteme those to be best

that are moost ignoraunte. I woulde counsell all suche rather to beget asses then men, or to geue their diligence & laboure to extinguishe the figure and force that God hath geuen them to knowe good & worthye thinges withall, and to make them liker beastes, then menne, for so they shalbe euen such as they wold haue them. If erudition and learning be noyfull vnto honestie and goodnes. and hurtfull to be brought vp amonge those, that be learned, then it shalbe better & most conuenience to nourishe & to bringe them vp in the conntrey then in the citie, & much better in a foreste, then in a village among men. But experience doth declare

the contrary & that children shuld be brought vp amonge those that be beste learned, & haue best experience. But to returne and to speake of womenLearned women are better then vnlearned. as I began, I by experience haue seene & knowen the contrary, & that all lewde & euill women are vnlearned, & that they whiche be learned are most desirous of honestie, nor I can not remember, that euer I sawe any womanne of learning, or of knowledge dishonest.

But we haue no neede of any authorities, for asmuche as we may heare the voyce of nature, agaynst the whiche (although that all the Philosophers woulde coniure in one) they shoulde assoone obtenebrate and darcken the sunne, as to preuayle agaynste it. Also we haue annexed vnto nature a celestiall testimonye. The Lorde doth admitte women to the misterye of hys religigion

in respect of which al other wisdom is but folishnes, and he doth declare that they were created to know hyghe matters, & to come as wel as men vnto the beatitude, and therfore they ought & shulde be instructed & taught as we men be. And that they are no better, it is our falt, inasmuchIt is the mās part to teache the woman. as we do not our duetyes to teache them. If the husbande be ye womans head, the mind, the father, & Christ, he ought to execute the office to suche a man belongyng, & to teache the woman: for Christ is not onelye a sauiour and a restorour of hys churche, but also a Mayster. The father oughte to nouryshe and to teache hys chyldren. And

what neede is it to reason of the mynde and of the heade? In the mynde is wytte, coun sell, and reason. In the head are all the senses wherwyth we doe guyde and rule thys lyfe, and therefore he doeth not hys duetye, that doeth not instructe and teache hys wyfe. And the selfe same Socrates doeth saye, that menne shoulde be ruled by Pnblyke and commune lawes, and womenne by theyr owne hnsbandes. And Paulei. Cor. xiiij. forbyddynge womenne to speake in the Congregation and commaundynge that they, yf they doubted of anye thynge, shoulde aske theyr husbandes at hooine, doeth bynde theim to teache

               O howe great warres hath there bene made for women? We take great payne and laboure to see, yt they lacke nothinge, and that oure doughters maye haue a conuenient dowrye, and yet we flee and auoyde the easye workes, by the whiche they maye be the better, for yf they were so, theyr flagitiousnes shoulde not cause vs to warre, nor they beynge contente with a lytle, shoulde neede nothyng, but alure many to loue them with ye beautifulnesse of their vertue. A woman after my iudgement oughte to knowe

her selfe, of what begynnyngWhat thinges women shoulde learne. she was made of, and to what ende, what the order and vse of thynges be, and speciallye what Christes religion is, without the whiche nothing can be well done nor iustlye. But yet it muste be religion & no superstition, to the ende she maye knowe what difference there is betwene them. Religion doeth make them verye simple and good, and superstition verye hypocrytes & molestious. And thus shall she perceyue and vnderstande in what thynges true religion doth consiste, & how they shoulde honoure God & loue theyr neyghboure, and thereby knowe howe she oughte to loue and honor her

husbande, whome she shoulde take as a diuine and a holye thyng, & obey his wyl as the lawe of God. Her house shall be vnto her as a common wealth, and she muste learne what her duetye & office is at home, & what is her husbandes. There are two principal vertues of a woman, the religion of nature, & chastitie, althoughe that religion doe cō
                  prehend all vertues. But we wyll seperatlye and exactlye geue preceptes of chastitie, for it muste be the chastitie of the wise virgyns, & not of the folyshe. She must know that shamfastnes is coupled with chastitie, & take heede to her good name & fame, that in all places she may be vnto ye lord

a good sauour to yt example & quietnes of her husband, and how prōpt & ready the cōmon sort of people be to iudge euil, and with what diligence thei do nourish & teach theyr children, She must learne also to contemne worldly chaunces, that is, she muste be somwhat manly & strong, moderatly to beare & suffer both good & euil, lest yt she being vnmete to suffer aduersite, be cōstrained other to do, or to thinke wickedly. If she cā not read these thinges nor yet by Nature learne them (for there be also such men) her husband muste so familierlye and playnelye teache her, that she maye remembre theym, and vse them when nede shall require.
               
                  Let her heare those that doe reade, and speake of such thin ges, yf she can reade, lette her haue no bookes of Poetrye, nor suche tryfelynge bookes as we haue spoken of before, for nature is ynoughe inclined to noughtines, although we put not fier to towe. And Seneca doth saie, that the time is shorte, althoughe it be all spente in well doynge. Such vertuous and holy bokes asWhat bo kes womē shuld reade. may learne her to be wyse, & inflame her to liue vertuouslye muste be delyuered vnto her, wherein yet, a certayne iudgemente and prudencye muste be vsed, that is, that they delyuer her no vayne, no chyldyshe, no barbarous,Note. nor no superstitious bookes.

Likewise she shal not be med linge with those curious and depe questions of diuinitie, yt which thinge besemeth not a woman. And as concerning morall Philosophie, those religious & vertuous bokes do suffise, for vertue doth teache vs all good fashions and maners. But yet yf we wil or in tende priuately to teache thē any customes, let thē be suche as shal stirre & prouoke them to liue wel & vertuouslye, and suche as be farre frō al conten tion & altercation, wher vnto womenne are but to much of thē selues inclined. Let her read many thinges to subdue & bring vnder the affections & to appeace and pacifie the tē pestes & vnquietnesses of the

minde. A woman hath verye great nede of this moral part of philosophi, in yt which these auctours are excellent. Plato Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarche. And in this thinge those writers do helpe, that declare the notable examples of vertue, worthy to be ensued & folowed, as Valerius Maximus, Sabellicus, and in like maner the lau dable workes of the holy and vertuous men of oure re ligion, and likewise of those, that haue folowed the worldly wis dome. Aristotle and Zenophon do write, how men shuld rule & gouerne their house and fa mily, & of the educatiō & bringing vp of childrē

And al suche as were praysed of oure elders for their eloquēce, were most extolled & lauded, forasmuch as they kept the language of their forefathers sincere and cleane, as Cicero declareth in his boke of an Orator. And Iuuenal euen crabbedly and not withoute a cause doeth saye, Lette not thy wife be ouermuch eloquent, nor full of her shorte and quycke argumentes, nor haue the knowledge

Egypt signifie, then that the deuil doch practise the dominion of sinne vpon mankind? And what other thing meant those horrible & vile cōmaundementes in mire and straw, but the abhominable & detestable contagiousnes of deuelish vice and sinne? for the vnfrutefull and voyd workes of this life, are strawe, a verye mete & a conuenient thing for fire. And the commaundemēt of Pharao, yt the male childrē of the Hebrues shuld be slayne & the females reserued, kepte, & nourished, doth opē the nature of Sathan yt verye enemy of the sprite, the frend of yt flesh, & the hater of al vertue: the which consenting to vice & voluptuousnes, choked vp

Zistus doeth saye, that the feruente louer of his owne wife, is an aduouterer. For a wyfe is (as yt prince of Rome sayd) a name of dignitie, and not of pleasure. Be not thou yt desireste to haue a chaste wife (for what is he that coueteth not that, although he be foolish) yt firste that shall inflame her to letchery, and to thinke euyll. What a madnes were it to de fyle and corrupt that thyng, the whyche yf thou shouldest

We are made al of towe, & to what part soeuer yt fire aprocheth we burne & letcherye is thorowout all the body dispersed. The wise phisitions do astonishe al such mēbers, as can not be healed. First let vs study to be whole & secōdarely to fele no payne. We do see, yt wise men continu allye do studye, yt no occasions be geuen to euill thoughtes. There were in times past cerReligiōs of chastisye. tayne religions of chastitie, yt whiche auoyded with al diligence as wel wordes, as al o ther thinges yt might sollicite

At Rome in the sacrifices of the good goddes, it was not lawfull to behold or looke vpon a paynted man. And in Lacedemon, and the ylande of Delo, it was a thyng moste detestable, yt any dogge shuld enter into the temple, inasmuch as it is a verye luxurious beaste, and therefore the prieste of Delo was inhibited once to name or to speake of a dogge.

Suche a man hauing two wyues is estemed farre aboue the chasti tie of many, as S. Augustine dothe affirme of Abrahā Jacobs grandfather, and he loued Rachel euen vnto death: and helde her for hys wyfe wyth all honestye. If thy wyfe other by nature or by custome be shamefast, increace thou the same by vse and doctrine, yf she be lasciuious and wanton, refrayne it so with seuere disciplyne and correction, that thou forgette not to liue merely and swetelye wyth her, and in chastitye,

Matrimonye is a sacramente and (as PauleEphe. v sayeth) a misterye of greate thynges, & therfore it ought not to be defyled nor spotted. The Deuyll kylled seuen of Saras husbandes, the whyche moued with her beautye,

began their mariage with car nal lust & pleasure: but Toby was preserued, the which beinge aduised & counseyled by the angel, began his mariage with praier. It shall be meete & conuenient to rehearse the wordes of the angell saynge: I wyl shew thee vpon whom that Sathan hathe power & dominion. Thei that cast godTob. vi from them, and marry to content and satisfie bodelye luste, as doeth the horse and mule, whiche haue no vuderstanding, may soone be ouerthrowen by the deuyll: but after yu hast married thy wife, go thy waye into thy chamber, and abstaynyng thre dayes from her, geue thy selfe to prayer with her, and in the fyrste

nyght thou shalt burne the liuer of the fyshe, and the deuil shalbe dreuen awaye. The seconde nyghte thou shalte be admitted vnto the companye of saynctes.

And sooner thou shalt be holpen & healed with one medicine, then with a thousand. And yf yu accustome thy selfe to doe iustyce, thou must leaue of and refuse some thynges that are graunted by the lawe. And learne thou to abstayne frome other mennes goodes, by abstaynyng from thyne owne. Thou muste

Thou haste no power (sayeth he) vpon thyne owne body, but thy wyfe, & likewise the woman is vnder the power and yocke of her husbād, so that nother of theym is at hys libertie withoute the assent of the other. She doeth greatlye offende thee, yf she communicate her body to anye other, & thou in like maner doest offēd her: & ye both doe offend god, as suertie to you both for eche other.

The solaces & pleasures of those which are mar ryed, must be rare & sober, remembring that thei are men,Marryed mens sola ces & plea sures. and naturally strong of mind to seke out laude & renowne by labor, and yt they haue past that age, vnto the which it se meth yt some solace & pleasure might haue ben grāted & per mitted. Likewise he must remēbre yt he is set to rule & gouerne yt familye, yt is, to geue good preceptes, & to liue accordingly, for els he shuld tres pase through a verye euil example, & so doing shoulde not kepe yt maiest ye that is nedefull and necessarye for a gouerner. And finally he ought

to remember that he is a chri sten manne, and that he hath forsaken the worlde, and the pleasures of the same, and therfore in matrymony must be moderate pleasure and pastymes, as though they went aboute to seke a refreshynge onelye of theyr cares and labours, and not a mayntaynynge and a continuūnce of theyr cupidities and bodelye pleasures. And the women in semblable maner muste be at these pastymes, that as she is partaker of the trauell and payne, she maye lykewyse reioyse in theyr recreations, that beynge therwith refreshed, she maye be the more able to sustayne and beare the burden. Of what wyll and

mind shal we thinke that woman to be, that seeth her selfe a companyon & felow in heauy & greuous thinges, and in al solaces & pleasures an outcast and abiected. This thing woulde displease a man, and much more a tender & an impotent woman: and specially when they see and perceyue that they are excluded from those delectations, sportes & pleasures, yt which of nature shoulde be common betwixte the wise and yt husbād. What shoulde I say of those husban des. the whiche with vnlawfull pleasures prouoke theyr wyues, and cause theym in a maner to be madde: Of the whiche Isocrates in Simachio doeth saye thus.

                  Nicocles the kyng of Salamina doeth speake. I haue condemned besides and aboue al these thynges, the flagitiousnes of those that haue marri ed wyues to liue a common life with them, and not being wt them contented, haue thorough their own carnal pleasures iniuried thē, but yf they by them shuld suffer, yea wer it neuer so litle, any like thing they would bitterly disdaine therat: and being to all other good and gentle, would shew them selues to their wyues most sharpe and vngentle, to whom they should vse them selues most peacesably and be ningly, in asmuche as thei are most familier amonge the secretes of their life, and partakers

of ye best of their goodes and substaunce, & thus the ignoraunt do norishe sedicion, & behind them do leaue discention, Thus sayth Isocrates: but yf they geue good coūsel that exhort thē to be humble, which are by fortune exalted, to yt end they shuld be lesse enuied, how much better should it be for yt husbād, to geue his wife no cause nor occasion to be ge lous, wherof ariseth great euil & mischife, for why ye mind being traueyled & greued wt such a passiō doth not feare to destroy it selfe, so it mai bring to an end yt it desireth. Some do beleue yt they do but gest & play, but suche play for ye most parte and most commonly do eth tourne vnto madnes.
               
                  And therfore we should take the better heede to obserue the auisementes and preceptes of holy scripture aboue anye other rule or precepte of philosophye, and consider the saying of the holy Apostle.

A christian oughte euen verye often to erect him selfe in spirite, and beleue that he shuld not passe ouer & cōsume his dayes in carnal & fleshely thoughtes, for yf he lyue not in spirite, as a christian shulde doe, he nother satisfieth hys

As longe as by the cōmaundement of the celestial god, we are included in this mortall bodye, we muste prouide that the spirite may lyue, and yt the body maye labor & serue yt spirite, as we do

perceyue & see in a horse, for if he be scarcelye fed, he cannot beare the burden, & if he be de licatly fed, he wil be stuburne, But as oyle must at certayne times be powred into yt lāpe that it maye burne, so are the times, in the which we do infūde & powre oyle both into yt body & soule, These two haue their time to be restored, although at no time, for our tyme being, we shuld fuffer thē to perishe, taking good heede that by the restoring of yt one, the other be not extinguished, nor that by seruyng of yt one, the other waxe slacke & feeble.

And they which are marryed, muste so honestlye geue them selues to the generation of chyldren, that the faythfull manne preparynge and geuynge hym selfe to that acte, may by the helpe of GOD in that be modestious. And in another place he sayeth: Lette those which are married principallye remembre, that they geue them selues to almose dedes, and

a wise man, more then althe cought of artificers, or of those that haue no experience. Hadste thou not rather stand with god and wysdom; then with the contrary part? Nor yet I saye not this, because thou shuldest so auoyde the common custome, yt thou shuldest fall wholy to the contrarye, as yf one shuld clothe him selfe with silke or golde, that thou, because thou woul dest not be like him, shouldest cloth thy self with white canuas or yf he weare a ringe of gold with a pretious iewel, yt thou shuldest weare a ring of yron, or of tinne with a flinte stone, or yf he were fedde wt capons & partritches, yt thou shouldest eate breade made of

branne, or any other vnhelth full or euill meate. There are in al the actions and workes of our life certayn lunittes & measures, among the whiche vertue doth consiste, and the man that is wise doth knowe them. Horace doth saye, yt the foolish, exchuing of vice, do fal into the contrary vices. My meaning is not, yt ciuility, and good maners shulde be taken frō eities, but yt all suche thinges, as be fallen in rume & de mye, might as much as were possible, be erected & restored agayn. And asin acitie there is nothing more vnequal, yt euery man shuld be like equal, so it is not conuenient that in one house euerye man shulde be like and equall together.
               
                  There is no equalitie in that citie. wher the prtuate man is equall with the magestrate, the people with the Senate, but rather a confusion of all offices. The husbande and the wyfe are lordes of the house, vnto whome the lordeGene. i. sayde, be ye lordes ouer the fyshe of the sea; the foules of the ayre, and ouer the beastes that moue vppon the earthe. And the selfe sameGen. ii creatour sayde vnto the woman, that she shuld be a helpe vnto the man. Therefore the husbande withoute anye exception is maister ouer al theThe authoritie of the man and wife. house, and hathe as touching his familie, moore authoritie then a kynge in hys kyngdome. The wyfe is ruler of al

other thinges, but yet vnder her husbande. There are cer tayne thynges in the house that onely do pertaine to the authoritie of the husbande, wherewith it were a reprofe for the wife without the consent of her husbande to medle withal: as to receyue straungers, or to marry her doughter. There are other thinges in the which the husband geueth ouer his ryght vnto the woman, as to rule & gouerne her maydens, to see to those thinges yt belong vnto ye kitchen, & to ye most part of ye hou shold stuffe: other meane thin ges, as to bye and sel certayn necessary thinges, may be ordered after the wit & fidelitie of the woman. There be women,

of whom I woulde take counsell, & suffer them to doe great maters, euē after their owne industry & iudgement. Unto other because of theyr improbitie and folishenes, I would scarcely commit thinges of smal importance, and valuere. Agayne dyuers countreyes haue diuers fashionsDiuers countrics diuers maners. & maners: for Mela the cosmographer doth say: that the women of Egipt do al out ward businesses, and that the men do spinne & gouerne the house at home: & that the women beare their burdens vpon theyr shulders, & men vpō theyr heades. In Hollande women do exercise marchandise, & the men do geue them selues to quafting, the which

customes & maners I alowe not, for thei agre not with naThe thin ges geuen by nature to man & woman. ture, ye which hath geuen vnto man a noble, a high, & a diligent minde to be busye and occupied abroade, to gayne & to bring home to their wiues & familie, to rule them & their children, & also all their houshold. And to ye womā nature hath geuen a feareful, a couetous, & an humble mind to be subiect vnto man, & to kepe yt he doeth gayne. Husbandes must remembre that they are men, and therfore thei ought to be stronglye mynded, and farre aboue all thoughtes and cares. Nature doeth inuite and call manne to suche offices, & maketh hym ready and fre from bearing & bringing

vp of children, the which thynges women do at home, but yet with so great heauynes and waight both of body and minde, that scantly they can moue theymselues. And what payne is it for a lustye man to gette & prepare those thynges abroade, that shalbe necessary & meete for his wife and familie? let him therfore be waking, & exercise al good and honest wayes both of wit and of bodye, that there lacke nothyng nother for wyfe nor familie, for so shall euerye one do their duety. Who is so cru el or so vngentle, that wil not see and prouide that his wife lacke nothyng? nor he doeth not his duetye, that wyll not prouide for his wife euē with

               ¶ Of the exterior and outward thinges.
               FOr why? in the societie & cōpany of men, one doth infecte the other, as in frute & beastes. And this contagious infection & corruption doth penetrate al our senses, the wor des by the eares, & the dedes by ye eyes. And therfore DauidPsalm. xvij. doth saye, yt we shulde vse the cōpany of good and innocent men, & auoyd those, that

be wicked & euil. He in the fable doth marueyle, & wonder at the nature of the yong mā, yt being so long in cōpani with the euil, he was not infected: but yet incōtinently after the thing it selfe did manifestly de clare, yt he was not vntouched nor vnbespotted. Therfore if it may be, thou must choose to dwel in a wel instituted & ordred citie, in the which be few corrupt, fewe euill maners, & fewe corruptors of the same. But yf thou canste fynde no suche citie, choose thou suche places, as are about thee.
               The straungers and gestes, the which that thou doste receaue into thy house, do oftentymes become thy enemies, & throughe a certayne

beneuolence do cause muche wickednes. Thou must therfore consider the cōpany, andAuoyde euill com pany. searche what maner of men they be, lest they cōueye anye flagitious personne into thy house, they which may bringe it into an euil name and fame. Such a one was Sergius Catilina, as sayeth Cicero, ye which left the house yt he entered in at, defamed, although he com mitted there no faulte at all. Nor this saying of Pitagoras, yt amonge frendes al thinges shulde be common, taketh no place in this thinge. I do speake of this vulgare & com mon amitie, for yt perfect loue & amitie is sildome seene: for yf it might be found, we wold no more holily regarde oure

owne mother, then we wold regard our frendes wife, and such correspōdent loue, shuld be able to saue chastitie & all other vertues: for what amitie is that, when one man calleth another his frend? The customes also & maners of thi wiues parētes must be wayd & considered. Also her eares muste be kept pure & cleane. For Hiero the Siracusane cō
                  Note. demned a certayne poete in a greate somme of moneye, because he hadde rehearsed vncleane & vnchaste verses, hys wife being present. There be yt do talke filthie & vnclenlye cōmunication for ciuilitie, & him to be rude & rustical, that taketh not a pleasure in the same. And to this they do all

this cōmon prouerbe. Al thin ges are helthye to those, that be whole.
               But Paule alledgynge Menanders verse vnto thei. co, xv Corinthians to let and withstande the sinister opinion of some, dothe saye, Let no man deceaue you, for euill cōmunication doth corrupt good ma ners. We are infected with filthie wordes, the whiche by the eares do descende vnto ye soule, & with filthie pictures, the which by ye eyes do so prouoke the mind, yt of ryght Aristotle did ordeyne & appoynteNote. a publike paine for those, that did set forth any suche pictures, wherby lechery kindled ynough of it selfe, might be in flamed. What a madnes is it

then to bye such pictures, and to set them vp in chambers? They are also worthye to be blamed, that before their wiues and their doughters do speake dishonestly, disclosing their lightnes & madnes, and that they in steade and place of the hearte, haue an imposteme, wherout floweth such corrupt matter. Thou shalte not admitte nor cal no yonge men vnto thy house, for of yt come these daunces, playes, banckettes, & other thinges,yongmen. that hurt & waste mens substance, nothing profitable for theyr honour and worshippe, the enemyes of quietnes, the verye pestilence of chastitye, and vnto GOD, the which is principally to be regarded

most odious. Thou shalt not bring these thinges into thy house, nor commende them in none other mans, nor leade thy wyfe nor thy doughter thither, for ye were to put fire & towe together. And therefore we do saye, as we haue sayd, that shamefastnes of the whiche procedeth chastitye, must specially be nourished & mayntayned in women, and chiefly to be had and shewed there, wher we feare of those to be reprcheded, vnto whom we beare moste reuerence, as of our fathers, our frendes, & familiars, & of those, whose cō pany we haue vsed of childrē, yf they be good and honeste. Learn her to set by her goodFame. name & fame, and to feare the

contrary. There is none suffi ciently chaste ynough, sayeth the declamator, whose honesty is searched and asked for. And another of the selfe same scole doth saye, he that doeth not feare the opinion & infamy of adultery, doth not feare to be an adulterer. The most valiaunt way for a man to be noble of minde, is to kepe him selfe in good estimatiō, for he that is vile & abiect, estemeth hys fame but lytle, nor yet what men say by him. For he dareth not once breathe vnto that, yt he despereth to come vnto, nor with laud goth not about any noble feates, and if perchaunce he finde them, he as with a rewarde doth content him selfe with them. But

he that is of a noble nature & courage doeth take & drawe strength vnto him, as fier in ye ayre, & howe much ye more he thinketh to be better, so much the more he doth study other by ye desire of laud & praise or by ye absolute mynde & exāple of vertue to be so. Thou must therfore now & thē blow this fier, other with thyne owne breath, or wt some other mās, to thende it maye kyndle and burne as it ought to doe. It shalbe profitable to know the maner and fashion of Eubolus,
                  Eubolus. the mayster of exercise and de fence, the whyche goynge into the scole of the yonge man Accetes, dyd by and by frame hym selfe to folow the gesture of Asbites the Crotoniate,

the which exercised him selfe in the fiue artes of plaies, and had wonne the game of ye circle. Those in whom he saw a faulte other in runninge or in wrastlyng, or that had wonne the price by any fraude or disteyte, he blamed, and that to feare ye yonge man from folowing & ensuyng thē, and to ye intent he shuld perceyue and know, that such deades were not cōmended ther, nor shuld not be cloked, but that they which brake the order and ru les of the scole, should be rebu lied. Eubolus commended all those, that frequented the same scole, and yt to incourage the yonge man to haue a desyre to be in like maner cōmē
                  ded, and to be ashamed in the

presēce of so many noble & valiaunt menne, to be rebuked. Hercules doeth speake wel and naturally in Neuio, saying: O my father, I do reioyce to be lauded and praysed of thee, whiche arte prayse worthye. Nor Themistocles the Atheniane coulde not stepe, when he mused vpon the tryumphes of My Isiades, Nor Achilles shuld not so greatlye haue estemed the glorye of the warre, yf Thersites had only beheld & loked vpō his noble actes, but ye 
                  Aiaces, the Diomedi, the Vlissi, the Nestori, the Chyldren of Atreus, and Hector his enemye dyd pricke them forwardes, the whiche woulde not haue bene slacke to haue woūded him, yf his corage or force had

fayled him. Nor this was no dull spurre, nor no smale prouocation. O my companions and felowes with how greatDisclose not the secretes of matrimonye. sorow shall Grece mourne to depart frō hēce, & how ioyful shall Priamus & his people be? Thou must circumspectlye & wisely speake to other men of thy wife, for ye secretes of matrimony are as wer it misteries, wher vnto thou shuldest admit no man: for yf thou do, thou shalt be taken as vnwise and folishe, the whiche thyng Candales ye kynge of Lidia hath taught vs. Holy scripture in the cōmendation of women sayth thus: And her husband shall commende her, that is,pro. xiij she shall be praysed with the affections of her husbande.
               
                  What greater laud or praise can chaunce or be geuen vnto the woman? the which thing is vnto her as a Theater full of her commendation. It is a very daungerous thing for a man to prayse his wyfe, forPrayse not thy wyfe to muche. men shall saye, that he intendeth to sell her, and suspecte hym of lightnes seing that he so highlye cōmendeth her: or elles the giftes & vertues (amonge the whyche gelosye hathe no place) that shoulde rather extinguishe euyl cupidities then prouoke thē, shuld very often through peruerse myndes be kynled to corruption, as Lucrece vertues plaied we 
                  Tarquinius: for there are some so importune in letchery, that thei loue & desyre

the thyng yt they shoulde abstayne frō, and the more they are remoued by reasō & equitie, the more ye flame of theyr desyre and loue encreaseth. And therefore they consydered the thynge moste wysely whyche sayde, that the moste surest waye was not to know a womanne, and that all occasions of synne and wyckednesse oughte to be remoued. For the LORDE doeth exhorte bothe manne and woman to desyre the celestiall and heauenlye father wyth diligente prayer, notMat. vi to be ledde into temptation.
            
            
               ¶ Of apparell and rayment.
               
                  GOd at the beginnyngGen. iij did cloth Adam and Eue to hide and to couer their secret parts withall. The other partes of the bodye were couered for dyuers necessities, after the qualitie and disposition of the ayre, some where to with stand colde, and other where to repell and wythstande hete, And therfore in al cities certen apparel for very neces sitie to satisfie the eye of man wythall was inuented and appoynted. But the euyll and corrupte nature of man hathe desyred and searched for honoure & ornamentes in all thynges, in good, in euyll, in sorowe, in shame, tourning

and wining that to honour & glory, the which at the begin ning was geuē & appoynted to shame and necessitie. And thus there is no ende of superfluous rayment, & special ly among those yt study to honoure their garmentes more then thē selues, as for ye moste part al women do, and many men also. That Philosopher (whosoeuer he were) sayde grauely vnto him, that tooke a pride in his apparell, go to qd he, & leaue not of to glorifie in the goodnes & vertue of a shepe. Aristotle maketh a magistrate named Gineconomon, whose office was to take hede,O how necessary were he in these our dayes that women shuld vse no inconuenient excesse in theyr apparell, & that it were mere

and agreable for their age & condition.
               And the Romaines hadde their lawes, bothe for the excesse of meat, and of rayment, wherewith they withstoode this euill. But nowe there is nother lawe nor magistrate, for now so much as is lawful to euery man, how muche as dothe please him: or to saye more truely, so muche dothe please him, how much is lawful, not by the lawe, but by his substance & riches. And therfore euery man may be in his owne house, both a law and a magistrate, as wel for the cō
                  mon vtilitie. as for the cōmon example. The husband muste consider, yt the woman ought to adourne and decke her self

for his eyes and pleasure onlye.Note ye women. And the prouerbe doeth saye, for whose sake and pleasure doeth the blinde mans wife trymme and decke her selfe? And the maker of the Lace demonians lawes commaunded full well, that maydens and virgins shoulde go forth vncouered, because thei sought to haue husbandes, & married women couered, because they had founde them already. He is verye simple & folish, whome his wife cannot please, excepte she be pricked vp and trimmed. Man shuld be in loue with vertue, and not wyth the apparell, wyth iewelles, nor wyth the fayre natyue skynne, howe muche lesse then wyth that,

that is paynted & filthy? And yf thou delite in these thinges, thou shalt when yu doste behold her naturall face & visage bothe lothe it & abhorre it. Be thou so affectioned to thy concubine, but not to thy wife: for thou sekest to be prouoked to luste & carnall pleasure by the senses, and not by any interior or inward loue. If thy wife howsoeuer she be apparelled, do content thee & please the (for she is one mind & body with the) to what pur pose are these anxious, molestious, perillous, & hurtful or namentes sought for & desired? Such gorgious & trimlyThe daū gers that come of gaye appa rel. decked wiues are gredy & desirous to wander abroade, & to be seene, and that is the

frute of al yt cost and charge, & they that behold thē so gorgi ously apparelled, are therby the more inticed & prouoked: for suche araye & ornaments do set thē forth, & much commend thē. Take diligēt hede that thou suffer not thy wife to be an inuenter of newe or of vnwontful thinges, leste yt therby shē be knowen, and be come acquaynted in the city, for vsuall & customable thinges are lesse noted & regarded. At home they will laye their handes to nothing, that is nedefull to be done, they kepe thē selues a loofe frō the kitchen, & other such vnclean places, & kepe thē in one place for filing of their apparell, or troubling of any of those thin

ges so artificiously cōpoūded & made. Her maydens forget ting & leauing all other thinges vndone, are all the daye longe occupied aboute trymming & decking of her. What shall I say, how great is their arrogancye and pride? For inasmuch as they are better and more preciously be seene then other, they despise and disdayne all other. Whereof springeth the enuye & hatred of the poorer sort, & kindleth the citie with hatred, whereout doth spring & arise verye often great factions, as in the time of our elders in Barcinni de Lelitanes in Spayne, when that the marchauntes wyues (the course of marchaundise from Alexandria

florisshing there) farre exceadeth the pompose and costlye rayment of the noble womē, prouokinge and increasynge therewyth fonde cupiditie, or gnawinge enuye, & so one thing doth grow of another. Pretious garments require conuenient hemmes and borders, girdelles, iewels, chaynes, and bracelettes: ye which places beynge so apparelled and adourned, wyll not suffer the handes to be bare, nor to be couered with all sortes of gloues, but with perfumed gloues, and wroughte wyth buttons of golde, here vnto come earynges, and other iewelles of pure golde, and then the worckemanshyppe that excelleth the matter,

and thus mens riches & substaunce, which they set forthe & shew in this wise & maner, decaye & come to ruine. It fa reth by ye apparel, as it dothe by writinges & instruments made of cōtractes & bargaynes: in yt which, because they made thē simple, hauing only a respect to equitie and good fayth, fewe wordes suffised:And is it not so nowe? but after yt cauillations were found oute, there appeared a thousand creuesses, the whiche☞ no witte nor wordes was sufficient or able to stop. So the simple & meane garment doth cōsist, & is of it selfe, but the curious hath nother end nor measure. The riche citezins yt suffer their wyues to haue, whatsoeuer they wyll

do much harme, for thei bringExample and emulation. in that custome and fashion, ye which euen she that hath litle or nothyng, wyl not doubt to folow, & doth esteme it as fylthy and a thing most inconue nient, to be ouer gone in luxurious excesse & rayment, but not in fayth, diligence, & chaste, for thei consider not, what they are able to do, but what other haue done. And therfore in certayne townes and cities euyl instituted and ordred, many womē through a desyre to be wantoulye and gaylye apparelled & besene, are content to be other mens concubines. But when the ryche perceyue, that the poore goe aboute to be equall wyth theym, they to exceade

theym, decke and apparell theym selues moore costelye and rychelye, and thus contendynge they comme bothe to ruyne, and that strengthe at the laste (as it is in the comedye) falleth downe headlonge. There are certayne woordes in Liui where he perswadynge for the lawe Oppia, that make for thys purpose, and are attributed and ascribed vnto the authorytye and Personne of Cato, the whyche for the grauitye of the sentence are worthye heare to be recyted. I (sayeth he) canne not fynde the cause nor the reasone of certayne appetites. For why? to be lawefull

full for some menne to doe certayne thynges. and not for thee, maye come of shame, or elles of dysdayne.
               So is the apparell and raymente of all menne yf it be lyke, for euerye manne wyll haue and coueteth that he seeth in another.
               That shame to be counted or taken for coueteous or for poore, is the worste and moste haynoust of all other. But the lawe taketh bothe frome you, seynge ye haue not the thynge that is lawefull for you to haue.
               But she that is ryche, doeth saye, equalitye doeth not please me, for why shoulde I not be sene in gold

and purple? And why is the pouertye of other cloked vnder the coloure of thys lawe? Wherby it apeareth that they regarde the lawe and not pouertie. O ye Quirites wyll ye geue your wiues suche a battel, that they being contented to be taken & estemed for ryche, should do that other cannot do, and that the poore shuld extend thē selues aboue their habilitie, because thei woulde not be despised? For so where no nede is, they shoulde be ashamed, & where nede is, they woulde not, and what she mighte prepare of her owne, she woulde, and that she coulde not, she should desyre and pray her husband to doe. Wretched is that husband,

the whiche whether he consent or no, shal see his wife haue that thynge of another, the whiche he gaue her not. This doth Cato say. And in what a miserable necessitie are they in that to vpholde suche charges doe searche diuers & payneful wayes ful of enuy, daungerous, scelerate, and vniuste? These men doe abuse theyr wiues, the which thynge Paule doeth forbyd, yet that not withstandynge they loue theyr husbandes euen as a mayster loueth hys diligent & faythful stewarde, of whome he perceyueth hys goodes to be truly and fayth fully vsed & augmented. And so doth ye costly & sumptuous wife loue her husband, not for

his owne sake, but for her owne vtilitie and profite: by whose industrious labour she liueth ydlye and arrogantly, hauynge greate abundaunce of al thynges. But yf fortune do turne, and the knot of loue be remoued and taken away, that loue wyl soone be loused and diminished, or els waxe verye faynte & feble. But beinge wise, thou shalt take ano ther way with thee, for thou shalt cal to thy remembraūce, that thou waste not borne for the woman, but the womā for the: & therfore thou must accustome her to serue the, & so to applie her mind, yt she may vnderstande and knowe that she is a helper and a partaker of thy trauel & labor. and

not an ydle mistres. Thou shalte take and refer all authoritie to thy selfe, & not to her, takynge diligent heede to her honoure and chastitie, as thou wouldest to thyne owne proper lyfe, for in this ye are but one. As for those delites, pleasures and ornamentes, thou shalte deride and laughe to scorne, nor no more esteme them, thē the ridiculous and folish desyres of children. And so thou shalt obeye the cousell of the Apostle, commaundynge vs so to haue oure wyues, althoughei. co.

                   we had theym not, and so to vse theym, that we abuse theym not. Thou shalt so apparel and araye thy selfe and thy wyfe, that Nature

may sufficiently be satisfied & thy dignitie kept and conserued. And yet in thys thynge ye must differ, for thou oughtest to be clothed more lyke a man, that is, more simplye and soberlye, and the woman more exactlye and cleanlye. And as greate costlye araye doth nother become man nor woman, so doeth cleane and honeste apparell become the woman. This is the force and strengthe of nature that can not be altered. Thys femine sexe doeth sette muche stoore by goodlye and precyous raymente, the immoderate and vnsaciable desyre thereof maye be brydeled and refrayned, but not cleane taken awaye and disanulled.

It shal be sufficiente, yf she be thus wel instructed & taught that in adourning & decking of her selfe, she do not so much regard the price and newnes of the thing, as to auoyde the vncleannes thereof, and so to behaue her self, that she be not lothed and reproued. The meane & moderate vse of ornamentes & garments with grauitie and cleanlines is of al men much more cōmended, then is that delicate & sumptuous raymente & apparell. He that doth araye him selfe very sumptuously & gorgiou slye, of some shalbe counted & taken for riche, & of other for a vayne waster. But he doth shewe hym selfe wise, that meanlye dothe apparell hym

selfe, and as necessitie shal require. That curious & exqui site decking of the womanne doth declare her to be vayne and light, nor the existimation or fame of her beautye, whose vniuersal grace is assined vnto her apparell & orna mēts, doth therfore increase or augment the more. Nor a married woman should not care nowe to be counted and retkened fayre vnto other mens eyes. O how greate a signe & token of chastitie & ofA womās true ornamentes and apparell a pure and a cleane heart is yt simple and meane apparell, the whiche doe then appeare most manifestly, whē all men do know, that she had rather adourne her selfe with wisdō grauitie and fayth, with gouerning

of her familie & housholde, & instructing and teaching of her children, then wt gold, silck. or pretious stones. Nor there is no man, yt doeth not much more honoure one such matrone, then a nūber of those, that glister in their pre tious & sumptuous ornamen tes & apparell. Who did not more honor Cornelia the mother of the Graccis being pore & without golde or pretious stones, then her hostes of Cā

Euery manne doth blame the poore woman, if she be sumptuously arayde, for they know ful wel in cities, what euerye mans substance is, & what he maye do. And therfore such a pore woman is reckened & taken as proude & insolent, and her husbande as fonde, that doth consent to her foolishnes and madnes. The riche are commended, yf they be modeste & tēperate in the vsage & vse of their riches, as thei be, which through their riches & great substance are not arrogante

nor statelye. Thus doth vertue adourne the raymente, & man is adourned of him self, & not of his vayne clothing & apparell. Marchaūts, whose riches is in the handes of fortune, are in more creditie, and the nobilitie within more fauour with the people, when they abase & somewhat apply thē selues to their qualities & customes.

               ¶ Of the husbandes absence.
               WHOsoeuer dothe intend to marry, muste so dispose & orders hys matters, that he departe & be absente from home as lytle as

may be, for it is an old saying that the eye of the mayster doth make the horse fatte, & the grounde fertile. In lyke maner all thinges, the mayster being present, are well & truelye done. For why? the forehead (as Cato sayth) is before the hinder parte of the heade. But inasmuch as we can not foresee the thinges, that be to come, when thou art absente do thy diligence, that thou be not long absent. It shalbe a helpe and for thy profite, to haue some saythful & trusty man, that may sende the word of all such thynges as be done at home. And yf thou haue no such man, remē ber to prepare ye one.

Committe thy house to some nyghe kynsmanne or acquayntaunce of thyne, whether he be manne or womanne, whose fidelytye is not vnknowen vnto thee.

               ¶ Of reprehention and castigation.
               
                  THe vice and fautle of a mās wife must (as sayeth Varro) other be suffered and borne wyth all, or elles cleane taken away, the whiche thynge chaunseth but syldome, but yfit canne not, it muste then nedes be borne wyth all. Yet lette hym not mistruste, but wyth all meanes and wayes studye howe to amende it, leaste that thynge doe chaunce, that the Poete doeth saye: By bearynge and sufferynge of thy Frendes faultes, thou shalte make theym thyne owne.
               For the mayster and ruler of the house muste knowe and vnderstand that he is set

as it wer in an high towre, to behold and see who commeth into the house, & to withstand all such thynges as may hurt the emolumentes and commodities of the same, or the good name and report of hys wyfe. Y et I woulde not that he should fayne any falfe drea mes of the goodnes & honestye of her, mouynge vayne tragides and noyses, as certayne bandogges do that be kept to watche, the which beynge troubled and feared in theyr slepe, do barke in suche wise & maner that they cause the house to be searched, and afterwardes are soore beaten for theyr vaine warning. And therefore, thou shalte not trouble nor vexe thy selfe

wyth anye suche bytter cares and thoughtes, of thyne owne inuention, least thou be scorned of other, and taken for lyght & cruel. A husbande asmuche as shall lye in hym to doe, muste beware that hys wyfe trespasse not, and be diligent to knowe suche thinges as he yet perfectlye knoweth not. But gelosye doethGelosye. onely trouble the mynde, and causeth it to be subiecte to moste bytter tormentes.
               Doest thou not take diligent hede to a peace or a cup made of glasse? and doest thou not nouryshe and brynge vp thy chylde without any gelousy? Why doest thou not the same vnto thy wife? Beleue not lightly ye euyl wylled, nor the

suspitious in great and waightye matters, nor the maligne interpreter of thynges, although they be thy parentes or frēdes, but yet to curious & to lyghte of credence.
               There was a noble man in Ualence called Carrosus, the whiche hadde a verye chasteA notable historye. womā vnto his wife, but yet of no good name nor fame, and of thys her frendes dyd often tymes accuse her vnto her husbande. Thys manne at the fyr

                  te neglected not the thynge, but gaue good eare vnto it.
               But after that he had found these suspitions to be vayne and false, and that they for all that ceased not calumniouslye to accuse her, enforsynge

hym as it were to punyshe her, he defendynge the Chastitie of hys wyfe, tolde them, what he hadde sought for, and what he hadde founde. But perceyuynge that they were not contented wyth hys wordes, he bought him a horse of a good kynde, and prayed theym to goe wyth hym, and to see hys horse runne, in the place betwene the palace and the Trinitie churche there vnto appoynted. And when he hadde made three or foure curses, he asked theym that saw hym, what they thought by hys horse, some of theym praysed hym hyghlye, and some in certayne poyntes dis praysed hym.
               
                  Then he drewe oute hys swerde, sayinge: I swere vnto you by Christe, that I wyll kyll hym, who soeuer he be, that shall speake euyll other of my horse, or of my wyfe.
               And thus at that time he put thē to silence. And after that the thyng was manifest, and her innocencye proued and knowen to all menne, he was counted and taken for a wise man, and a man of great courage. Reprehention, and correction muste bee done for amendemente, or for the example of other.
               For other wyse it is vengeaunce, or elles a spyce of Crudelytye, the whyche some doo vse agaynste those that they doo hate: yea, and

do kill them, and yet do saye that they do but chasten thē. A goodly maner of correctiō in dede to kil one. Seneca doth saye, that no wise man doeth punishe for the faultes cōmitted, but to thende, that hereafter they shulde trespasse no more, for the thing once done can not be reuoked, but yet it maye be so reprehended & auoyded, yt it shall be done no more. There be thre kindes of sinnes & trespasses in wedlocke,The tres passes of matrimo nye. & thre wayes to amend them. The first and most greuous is adultery, the whiche doth separate the man and ye woman, & doth so breake themat. xix. bande of matrimoniall loue & charitie, that euen by the lordes owne wordes & sentence

he may refuse her, although his will be, that she infected or infamed with anye other vice, be kept & retayned. In this thing men do vse the castigation by the lawe permitted. A wise surgen dothe not burne nor cut any manne, except very necessitie cōstrayne him, or yt there be none other remedye. And yet or euer he beginne, he considereth hys instrumētes, his audacitie, & hys knowledge, & then yf he perceaue, yt he be not able to do it, he will not medle withal. There are other like faultes, & likewise other that are meane betwene thē both, the which by reprehention & correction may sone be amēded. And after yt thou hast chosen

thy wife, thinke with thy self that it can not be comprised with fewe wordes, that with longe experience can not be opened nor knowen. Nor thou must not beleue, that she is perfecte, for afterwardes knowing the contrary, thou shalt pecceaue, that thouwast begiled. Thinke therefore to finde a greate deale lesse of those thinges in her, then appeared at the begynnynge, that thou, yf thou fynde any mo, mayste be a gayner. FurthermoreThe miserable estate of women. thou muste consider, that womenne be sickly, and feble of bodye, troubled with many diseases, and in mind fore vexed with diuers tempestes & motions. And what grefe dothe she suffer

monethly in purginge of her selfe? what fastidiousnes beinge with childe, & after that she is deliuered? And how is she rent & broken at her vprising? & to how many perilles and daungers is she subiect? wonder it is, that any of them do escape deathe. And what other thinge do they all their life time but serue vs? the doughter serueth her father, the wife her husband, the mother her children. Of mynde they are not so strong as mā, their iudgement, their eruditiō, & their experiēce is farre vnder mans. Who is so cruel then, ytwil not pitie this their miserable estate & condition? And therefore we oughte to wincke at many of their faultes

and as the strōger, suffer and beare with the weaker. Paul sayth, ye that are strōg oughte to beare with ye feble.Ro. xv And yf that wise greke, because he wold not be greuously offended with his frendes misdoinges, was wont to say thus with him self. And this is a man also, a mutable creature, apte to fall, & to be deceaued: how much more reasonably should the selfe same be thought of a woman? And nature doth teache vs, that youth shuld geue place to age the stronge to the feble, & the right to the lame. And yf the wiseshuld not beare with the foolish, he shoulde not sufficiently aunswere, & satisfie the excellencie of his name. And

besides al this, ciuill education and maners, reason, and the sentences of the wise, do perswade this, and likewise peace and domesticall quietnes do moue vs vnto ye same. What payne and labour wol dest thou take, both by water and by land to gather a lytle moneye, wherewyth thou mightest liue quietly and ioy fully at home? Why shuldest thou not then suffer a litle in commoditie at home to haue qnietnes, without the which riches are nothinge profitable, nor life it selfe swete nor pleasaunte. What amitie or frendshippe canst thou finde, wherin thou must not suffer and dissēble manye thinges? Thou shulde ste in like maner

waye and consider, whether the thing yt displeaseth thee, was done of weakenes, or of malice, for so doing, yu mayste moderatly correct it. But inasmuch as correctiō is one of those bitter medicines which heale not yt body without lothing & ahhorring ye thing: it shuld not be ministred, except necessitie required it. Nor there is nothing ye causeth re prehention to be so well estemed & accepted, as when he yt is wise & beneuolent dothe

                  If thou secretly do shew thē way of vice, & vitious liuing, why shuld est thou cōplayne, yf they of thy owne house do as thou doest learne thē? he would aunswere him, yt shuld rebuke him, as the child Asotus aunswered, and sayde vnto his luxurious father, that reproued him, as it is redde in Cestius Pius declamations. And we must know and perceaue, that often reprehention

that is moore greuous, the whyche thynge we doe see that these craftye marchaun tes, and subtyl courtiers doe vse, the whyche doe proue theyr credence, and howe theyr prynce doeth fauoure theym in greate and ieoperdious matters only, leauing all other smale and lyght busynesses vntouched. There are other faultes, the whych muste be pretermitted & not medled wythall, when there is anye hope of amendment, other for honoure sake, or yf anye other vyce or faulte, yf they were detected shoulde spryng and aryse of the same. Some ther be, that willyng lye do amende, yf they thinke not them selues to be taken

as euyll and reproued personnes. Gneus Pompeius in the the warre agaynste Sertorius dyd burne the whole hooste lookynge vpon hym, the letters whyche were founde in Sertorius cheste, to the entente that the Citizyns, perceyuynge theyr secretes to be disclosed, shoulde not be taken for enemyes. Cesar dyd euen the same after that he had ouerthrowen Pompey at Pharsalia, and lykewyse in Affricke, when Metellus Scipio was ouercommed. There be certayne smal faultes, the whiche are natural bothe to man & woman, & ought to be suffered & borne withall in the woman, in asmuche as she doeth kepe her

chastitie, & specially when she with ofte reprehention wyll not amend, for then by thy pa cient suffering of her, yu shalte haue great profile & find her veri benigne & gentle & vsing thy self to suffer & to forbeare her, she wil be vnto thee most pleasaūt, for familier cōuersation causeth al bitter thinges to be swete & sauoury. Thou must not reprehend her furiouslye, but wt iudgement, nor feruētly, but coldly & discretly, for yt reprehētion which is annexed wt grauitie & tēperā
                  Approued repre hention. cie of mind, is most aproued & most effectuous as whē thou she west thy selse to be moued wyth the greatnesse of the faulte, & not for any disdaine, nor to satisfye and contente

thine affections, but to amēd her whome thou rebukest. Thou muste obserue bothe tyme and place, leaste that throughe feruentnes of reprehention thou bespot thy wyfe, and cause thy chaunces to be openlye knowen to straungers, and other thy familiars, whereby in tyme to come thy wyfe shall continuallye hate thee. Be not longe angry, leaste yt thy desperate wyfe fall headlonge into vice and noughtynes. The apostleCol. iij. sayth, ye husbandes loue your wyues, and be not bitter vnto theym. And yf the lorde forbyd vs to be angrye wyth oure brother, howeMat. v. muche ye lesse ought we to be angrye with our wyues, the

which exceade all brotherlye loue and beneuolence, as we haue tolde you before, and it is meate it be often times repeted. And yf manne be the head of the woman, & ChristeEph. v. the head of the man, he must vse hym selfe vnto the womanne, as Christe doeth vse him selfe vnto us, that is, beniglye and frendelye. And the selfe same Apostle doeth call the womanne the bodyeEph. v. of the manne, as the churche is the bodye of Christe. And not wythstandynge we sustayne and suffer manye incommodities of the bodye, yet we hate it not, but suffereth it, nourysheth it, and gouerneth it. The husbandes reprehention muste be short,

for yf it shoulde continue, hatred would ensue, the whiche woulde coule matrimoniall loue, kyndle disdayne, and chaunge the swetenesse of theyr conuersation into bytternes. Furthermore, thou muste alledge the reason and cause that moueth thee to rebuke her, that bothe nowe and in tyme to come, she may be admonished. The force and strengthe of reason hath great power in the mynde ofReason. man, nor there is nothynge that so cleaueth vnto it, nor lesse penetreth the same, as thys sentence: Thus I wyll, and thus I commaunde.
               Thou muste so rebuke her, that she maye perceyue it to procede & come of good loue,

to make her better, and to be without vice or faulte, yt the loue whiche is betwene you maye be the more feruēt, and without anye quarel or complaynt at al. Therfore assone as thou hast chastened & corrected her, and that she, other by worde, honeste shamefastnes, or silence doeth declare that she wyll obey thee, geue her then fayre wordes again, and a gentle countenaunce as thou waste wonte to doe. Ther are in noble women as ther is among men, certayne excellente motions of the mynde: the whyche to those that be not wyse, and doe marcke the thynge but slenderlye, seme to come of arrogancye and pryde. Nor these

ought not vtterly to be kept vnder, and cleane extinguished, for without theym they canne not approche nor come to that hyghe and memorable ornament, that exciteth and moueth man to maruaile and to prayse & extolle them. Such affections of the mind are apte & meete to conserue and kepe the honestye & chastitie of women. Such noble women shuld not be greuously or sharpely reprehēded or rebuked, but drawen frō vice, other by ye example or vertue of such women as be gone alreadye, or of those that they were aquaynted wyth all, or elles by puttynge theym in remembraunce of theyr olde vertue and godlye lyuynge.

To some woman a becke of her husbande is sufficient to declare, yt there is somewhat amisse, yt displeaseth him, and specially yf she beare her hus bād any reuerēce. An honest matrone hath no nede of any greter staffe, but of one worde or one sowre coūtenaunce of her husband. But where yt this can not helpe, but thatNote ye husbandes. brawling & staues acre must nedes be vsed, I geue no pre ceptes nor rules, for there they vse violence, but yet by mine aduice the husband shal neuer come to yt extremitye, for yf thy wife be often rebuked & will not bowe, but waxeth more stiffe & croked: yet inasmuche as she kepeth her selfe pure & chaste, she must be

supported and borne withal. Nor the bow must not be bro ken with to muche bendynge therof. Thus dyd Socrates forbeare his wife Xantippa, whom we should folow, yf we wer so wvse as to thinke that our pacience by reason of the womā is exercised & proued, to ye augmentation & increase of vertue, as Iob & Toby did to theyr great profite, and toIob.

with him selfe, that the omnipotente and euerlasting God doeth dispence and order al thynge moste wyselye, and moste iustelye. Finallye, it is meete and conueniente that the authoritye of God, whyche coupled theym together, shoulde sette them at one yf they were out, & agre thē. And what man durste be so bolde to breake the peace that the king hath made? Or who wolde reiect him that by some noble man was cōmaun ded & deliuered vnto him? yf in thys thyng the reuerence that we haue and beare vnto those whyche are of greate power be of suche force and strengthe., or elles loue it selfe, howe muche shoulde it

be towardes god? for who is so mighty, or so louinge vnto, vs as he? him we shuld reue rence & loue aboue all other thinges. Also he ought to remēber what Paule sayeth, ye the wife & the husband are alEphe. v one flesh. Of ye body do come continually many incōmodities, but yet no manne dothe hate it, but to his power doth nourish it, & yf at any time he be miscontent there with by and by he pleaseth it agayne. Such like loue shuld euerye man beare his wise, and this after the minde of ye Apostle.
            
            
               ¶ Of the proceding and going forwardes in matrimony.
               
                  AFter ye thou haste had experience of thy wife, yu oughteste to loue her more tenderlye. And nature doth induce a man to that, yt which doth make swete, familiar, and customable thinges, be thei neuer so sharpe or greuous, for the vse & continuall cōpany doth so establishe and cōfirme loue & beneuolence, yt we vpon that occasion, doe loue dogges, cattes, horses, & other brute beastes, and do mourne & sorow their death and absence. And what thing is lesse conueniente for a wise & a well nourtred man, then not to loue his wife, whose cō pany he hath so longe & so familiarly vsed? Meleager Oeneus
                  
sōne being both angry wt him selfe & all hys sat him downe in his chamber: The Curetes, whiche made warre agaynst the Calidonians assayled the citie, & molested them so sort, that ther was no hope nother in man nor woman. The eldersMeleagers loue towardes hys wyfe of yt citie came vnto Me leager the only saue garde of al the countrey, desiryng him to put on his harnes, and to defend thē. yea, the priestes with their ceremonies were present, & promised a greate rewarde, but he dispised all this. Then came Oneus his fa ther, a man worthy of great veneration, & kneled downe before hys obstinate sonne, Hys mother also, whose angre was nowe chaunged into

humble prayer and piticion came vnto hym, hys systers and hys moste pleasaūt companions, wyth whom he hadde lyued moste iocundly the best part of all hys tyme, prayed him not to forsake thē now in this their extreme pe ryi, & ieoperdie. But yt fearce mynde of hys was nothynge moued, but denied the helpe that all they with exhortacion, prayer, and promis desyred. In the meane whyle the enemyes entred the cytye, and sertynge it a fier in dyuers and manye places, murdered and loore vexed the people. Hys wyfe Cloopatra beynge soore afrayed, came vnto hym, sayinge:

Helpe vs O my husbande, for yf thou helpe vs not, we are all but deade, for oure enemyes haue and posesse all. That implacable and fearse heart, moued with the only voyce and peryll of hys wyfe, armed hym selfe, and driuynge hys enemyes out, delyuered the citye from extreme daunger and peryll. That noble man had wrytten in his heart, that precept of nature, the whyche he neuer read nor hearde, by the whyche he knewe that hys wyfe and he were all one, and that all other (notwithstandyng they were knytte vnto hym by greate loue and amitie) were without hym, and that a mans wyfe is so vnited

& with such a coniunction and knotte bounde vnto her husbande, that he doth many thynges for her the whyche he woulde not doe for hym selfe. Doeth that noble and moste worthye boron in Homer cry this alone, doth Agamemnon & Menelaus onlye loue theyr wyues? For so doeth euerye honeste man that hathe anye poynte of iudgement: as I loued moste heartelye Loryseis, althoughe I toke her in warre. That kingMasuissa kinge of Numidi
                        •
                     
                   (as Salust writeth) lyinge nowe a diynge, exhorted his chyldren to concorde after thys sorte and maner. Who is moore frendlye then one brother to another? Or who shalte thou fynde to be thy

frende, yf thou be enemye to thyne owne? Who canne thynke that thou louest hym, that perceyueth thou louest not thy wyfe, beynge good and honeste? And yf thou offended wt certayne her vices doest hate her, it shall cause thy frendes to forsake thee, to ye whyche it is not vnknowen, that no manne lyueth withoute faulte, and do trust that throughe vse and tyme they shall waxe tollerable: but seynge thou (the whiche haste bene so longe acquaynted & conuersaunte with thy wyfe) canste not beare her, what other thynge canne he hope or truste, but yt the more strayghtlye and familiarlye thou arte conuersaunt wyth

him, and the better that thou knowest hym, the lesse frendlye thou shalte be vnto hym? Canne there be anye vyce (I speake of these common vyces) so farre frome the nature of any man, as the nature and maners of beastes be? And yet conuersation doeth so worke, that they lyue pleasauntly vnder one roofe, and that manne doeth playe and sporte hym selfe with the Lion, and the nature and dedes of eche of them doeth so please & contente the other, yt beinge absent they seeke eche other: for familiaritie is of suche vehemencye and force, that it coupleth those thynges, whyche are of contrarye natures, and that because

malice is farre of for yf it were mixed the rewith, it coulde not clapse nor fasten those thynges, whyche are most lyke eche other, so greatMalice. a poyson is malice vnto concorde & good agrement. Nor thys herbe called mynt, doth not (as the naturall PhilosophersThe propertie of the mynt. doe saye) so muche let mylke to be tourned into chese, as the malyce of the hearte, doeth lette veneuolence to encrease and growe. And in matrimoniall debate and discord, the man is more blamed then is the woman, because that he beynge the chiefe ruler and heade, doeth not (as sayeth Uarro) purge her of that vice, the whyche ingendered that discorde, or

els pacientlye beare and suffer the same, for the blame of al discorde is moste commonlye layed vnto hym that is best: because he would not moderate nor let the thynge to come to suche a stryfe and discorde, or els because he was not able to doe it: In the first there appeareth manifest ma lice, in the seconde impacience and weakenes, the whyche oughte to be far from him, yt is estemed to be moste worthyest, & appoynted to rule & gouerne other. And thus he commeth into hatred, for asmuch as he hath begiled vs & lefte of to do hys duetye and office when it neded not.
               That loue vnto thy wife, after thou haste enioyed her,

for a season doeth waxe feble and colde, is a thynge moste mete and cōuenient for those that are kindled with bodely luste and letchery, the which are verye beastes and no men, hauinge no reason, but are drawen to those deades through the motions of their senses, the whiche after that the heate be a lytle paste, shall cleane chaunge their opinion. Also there are other occasions that should cause thys beneuolence and loue, in case he be not duller then a stone:The causes why the husbād shuld loue hys wyfe. As that hys wyfe hathe suffered so greate trauell and labour, that she hath brought hym for the chyldren the heyres of hys name and substaunce, and the vpholders

of hys familye: and that she hathe forsaken her fathers goodes and ryches to folow hym, and to suffer wyth hym bothe good & euyll, and that she settynge her whole mind nowe vpon hym, knoweth nother father, nor yet anye of all her kynne. What one thynge then shall suffyce to knytte theym in loue, yf manye thinges canne not do it? who so wil then obey nature, humanitie, and wisdom, shall euery day loue his wife more and moore: And the better he knoweth her, the more he wyll truste her, and to open & disclose hys loue, shal shew her greater signes & tokens of beneuolēce, manifestinge yt to be borne and nouryshed

throughe the expience of her vertue, & through hope to be cōtinued & kepte, that in time to come she maye be like her selfe, and (as Plato writeth) stryue to ouercome her selfe with vertue. Thou shalt only loue thy wyfe thus tender ly, but frō her, as srom a foun tayne, yu must extende it vntoThe husbād must loue hys wyues kinsfolk. her parentes & kinsfolke, to thende that they maye well know & perceiue, how greatly their cosyn doeth ayde and helpe them, & that she in lyke maner maye vnderstande that thy beneuolence & loue to her is suche, that it red undeth amonge her frendes and parentes, and of thys thou shalte receyue no lytle profite at home. And yf we

wil that her kinsmen be loued for her sake, how muche more ought we thē to loue her chil dren, the whiche yf thou loue their mother, can not be but most dearly beloued, & moste acceptable vnto thee: & she in like case shall loue thine, yl yu haue anye: & they seinge this mutual loue betwene vs, shal knitte & couple thē selues in good loue & charitie. In matrimonyChaūces there chaunce many casualties, as pouertie, infamie, enprisonmente, banishement, & sicknesses, the whiche are rōinon to all men, and yet may touche onelye the one of thē, which are married, & not offende the other: as yl thy fa ther in law (of whom thou lokedst to haue had a great inhe

ritaūce) had lost all his goods and wer defamed, wherwith his daughter also were somwhat bespotted, & falsely conuicted of some crime, & imprisoned, or banished the citie, or fallen into some disease or sickenes. But as concernynge thys thing, I wil only say, as nature doeth prescribe & determine it: for god doth commaūde vs, to beare such goodLuc. vi wyll and mind vnto other, as we wuld & desire they should beare vnto vs, nor that only in thys greate coniunction of soule and bodye, but also vniuersallye vnto all menne. Supporte and suffer thou thy wyues mischaunces, as she oughte to suffer thyne, for matrimoniall loue should

haue euerye thynge so mixte and myngled, that they shoulde not saye, thys is myne and thys thyne, but that all thynge, as profyte and disprofyte, good and badde shoulde be common.
               And yf ye be one and not two, then canne not she be sycke and diseased, but that thou muste nedes be sycke with her, nor she poore, and thou ryche: The whyche thynge canne not chaunce amonge frendes, howe shall it happen then where is so greate and so faste a knotte and coniunction both of mynde and of loue?
               A sure and a true frende sayeth Ennius, is in a thinge vncertayne.
               
                  Her syckenes and afflictions shall declare howe well thou dydst loue her when she was in healthe. And folowyng the instincte of Nature, and the commaundemente of God, thou shouldest iudge her to be euen one thynge with thy

And as charitie through mer cy should grow & increace towardes thy selfe & thy chyldren, so should loue teach thee to do towardes thy wyfe, tru ly louing her as thy selfe, and as thyne owne proper chyldren:

wherby she being diseased or troubled by fortune, shalbe vnto thee more derely beloued, then euer she was in her moste floryshyng estate and condicion, women haue their certaine smal debates & enuye, and theyr diuers disdaynefulnesses and hatredes the whiche of verye lyght occasions and causes do spryng and ryse sodenlye, as of suche whose iudgemētes are weake and feble, but with suche matters men of grauitie oughte not to medle. They haue like wyse theyr proper ambition and pride bothe in worde and place, and whether they sit or goe. But yet the husbande shal not encrease these thynges, nor shewe hymselfe a minister

nor a reuenger of her complaintes and sorowes, be cause she was not honoured nor taken after her wyll and pleasure, but rather to laugh at them and contempne thē: callynge moste diligently vpon her to see to other thinges of moore importaunce & profite. For suche as doe medle or trouble them selues with suche lyght & folishe matters are more mete to weare womēs apparell & garmentes, & to spynne, then to weare a berde, or to be estemed or taken for a man. Make such mē rulers of cities, seing thei are so vnapte to rule & gouerne their owne familie, and housholde. What thinge is there moore vnmete for a manne

then to moue or to trouble hym selfe wt the lyght appitites & fonde lustes of women.
            
            
               ¶ What vtilities and profites the mutuall loue of those whyche are marryed doeth brynge.
               IT can not be wel rehearsed nor told, how manye vtilites and profites this concorde doeth brynge to great thynges bothe at home & abrode, nor how many losses & incōmodities do growe of the dissentiō and discorde yt is betwene the good manne and hys wyfe.

The housholde when theyr maister and theyr mistres are at debate can no otherwyse be in quiet and at reste, then a citye whose rulers agre not, but when it seeth them in con corde and quietnes, then it re ioyseth, trustynge that they wyll be euen so vnto them as it perceyueth theym to be amonge thē selues, wherin surely thei are not deceyned, for yf yt man & his wife do benigly & gently support & intreate one another, they learne not to disdayne, or for euery light fault to be angrye with theyr seruaūtes, or yet for any hous hold words to be vexed or an gry with eche other, but to set a syde al hasty and cruel wordes & correctiō with all other

thinges that procede of a disdaynefull & a furious minde. And the seruauntes are not onely mery therfore, but also they do theyr seruyce ye more obediently & gladly, shewing reuerence vnto the maiestye that procedeth & increaseth of quietnes and concorde. For the husband doth defend hys wyues maiesty with loue and beneuolence, and the wife her husbandes with honor & obedience. What shal I neede to saye yt cōcord causeth thē to be estemed wise and honest. And they muste nedes be good, seynge they haue loued so long together. Nor ther can be noNote. longe amitie or frendshyp but betwene those, that are good, the whiche doe suffer and deuour

vp those thynges, for the whiche other men leaue & forsake amitie, and breake of charitie. Nor there groweth of none other thyng so great reuerēce & maiestie, as of the opinion and estimation of ano ther mās goodnes & wisdom, the which reuerēce is not onlye honoured within the dores, but also shyneth and extendeth it selfe into the citie, so that he is taken for an honest man, and borne to be louing and gentle, seing that he loueth so constantly, and for a wise man, considerynge ye he fo moderatly can handle so di ficulte and hard matters, and worthye to rule a common wealth, that with such wisdō and iudgement doth rule his

owne house, and that he may easely conserue and kepe his citezyns in peace and concorde, that hathe so well stablyshed the same in hys owne house and familie. And on the other syde, who thynkest thou wyll beleue, that thou arte able to be ruler or to kepe peace and quietnesse in the citye, seynge thou canst not lyue peacesably in thyne owne house, where thou arte not onelye a Ruler, but a Kynge and Lorde of all?
               Leontinus Gorgias (theLeon-tinus. whyche was the syrste that amonge the Greekes was commended for hys eloquence) exhortinge the Grekes wyth manye wordes at the playes of Olympe vnto

peace and concorde, certayne men (as it is sayd) cryed out, saying. Let him first be at con corde with his wyfe and hys mayde, and then come to persuade & counsell vs to peace. Ther is no man, but wil trust to obtayne (& that easly) the amitie and frendship of so noble & so gētle a person, whose benelouence & gentlenes can not be equinalled wyth all worldlye ryches. How magnificente a thynge is it, to be taken for good and faythfull in another mans house? as it is written of Crates Thebanus,
                  Crates. vnto whome for his singuler goodnesse, and loue that he bare vnto his wife Hypparchia, was graunted, to entre not onely into the gate, but into

the chambers and most secret places of all the citie, and ther fore the Grekes called hym Thirepanictes, that is a manne that might entre and go into other mennes houses. For no man doeth mistruste or feare that he wyll defyle any other mās bed, that agreeth so well with hys owne wyfe, & with so swete and so sure a knot is fastened vnto her. All the whole familie do theyr dueties, when the wife doth gladlye and wyllynglye helpe her husbande, and the husbande his wyfe moued by the onely loue and concorde that is betwene them: for he that is not moued nor styrde with ye furiousnes and commotions of the mynd, may easely retayne

and cause theym to doe theyr dueties, so that he leaue not of, nor fayleth not to doe hys owne duetye. Thus they maye with diligence gouerne their goodes and substaunce, so that neyther of them be alienate & farre from their domesticall & familier cares and busynesses, and in their familie do rule & tēperal thinges with loue. He is far deceyued that doeth thinke, that feare, rewarde, or anye other lyke thinge shal so quicken or prouoke a man to do his duetye, as charitie and loue shal doe. Menne perchaunce wyll not greatly meruel if theyr owne children be swete & moste acceptable vnto thē, the whiche yf they wer but ye chyldren of

one of them, yet loue myghte so worke, that they shoulde be vnto eche other most accep table & pleasaunt: how much more then must the flame nedes burne, vnto the whiche they bothe, as it were putte torches vnder? But this peraduenture shall seeme moore merueylous (the which vnto those yt haue the knowledge of naturall thynges is moste playne & sure) that ye children of those whiche be married & loue one another, shalbe meke peaceable, modeste, amiable, and apte to all kynde of benignitie and gentlenesse. For why? the qualities and affectiōs of ye father & the motherNote. (the which do occupie the inwarde partes of manne) are

most commonlye transfuded into the bodies and soules of their children, and of their pa rentes they learne placabilitie & mekenes. To lyue thus at home in tranquilitie & concorde, is muche lyke the celestial and heauenly lyfe: wherof (as sayeth that wise man in Homer) greate ioye and cherefulnesse redoundeth vnto their frendes, and to their enemies greate sorowe & heauines: and as the other reioyce, these doe lament when they see or heare that we be other in hatred or in any discorde: for the euyll and wycked man doeth desyre that is euyll, & exchueth vertue, as a most pernitious poyson. But all that I haue sayd hitherto

(although as ye doe see, they are of great importaunce) yet they can not be compared to thys one thynge, that I wyll now saye. At home we learne charitie, the whiche we maye vse and shew towardes other that beinge in tranquillitie, & pleased with the suauitie and swetnes of mutual and correspondent loue, we may ye ease lyer geue our selues to religion, to contēplation, to loue, & to geue reuerence to that om nipotēt & diuine nature. And our heartes being thus touched wyth matrimonial loue, and with ye holy & celestial fier we shal by litle and lytle, be so kindled therwith, that it shall conceyue & bring forth great flames. And what greater or

more excellent gift may be desired or graunted of god vnto mākind, then that we may be made true and faythful louers of that his diuine beauti fulnes.
            
            
               ¶ Of those that haue no children.
               VNto some the lord now and then geueth no childrē, or els he taketh them agayne, when he hath geuen them, & that by his secrete & incomprehensible iudgement yea with a fatherly indulgēce and pitie: For he seeth it to be for our profite, yt it shuld be so, lest yt we shoulde referre all thinges to fortune & naturall causes, the whiche thinge no wise man, nor no christen man

shuld do. And let vs take it for no smal benefit yt we haue not proued of yt swete gal, for after that we haue swalowed it, we shall saye, yt there is put vnto one drop of hony, sixe hūdred droppes of gall: And he did euē reasonably rekē it amongye felicities of man, to liue wtout childrē. And August through his doughter & his nyce was cōstrayned co rehearce euē wt alowd voyce these wordes of Homere. Wold god I had ne uer bene married, for then I shuld haue had no children. I willet passe Cicero cōplaynts to Atticus. Nor I wil not dis pute here of ye priuatiō of childrē, but only monish & exhort those yt be married, yt they (because the frute of chyldren

is so vncertayn, & that oftenti mes they do bring vnto their parentes more calamitie then profite or pleasure) seke not to haue children by anye flagitiousnes, yt is, with one certayn euil, one vncertayn calamity. Be not sharpe nor bitter to your baren wiues, for yt chaun seth very often without anye faulte other of ye one or of the other, or of thē bothe. And ye shal vnderstand & know yt the wyfe desyreth moore to haue childrē, then ye husband, as the wal that is falling, desireth to haue shores to vphold it wt al. Anne yt wife of Helcana yt

               ¶ Of her that is in age.
               AFter yt an honest & a wel nourtured wo mā waxeth old, we must do as men vse to do to al faithfull & diligent seruaūtes, we loose & vnbind our old horse and oxe, & suffer them to wander and to feede wher they wil thē selues, and

put them to lesse laboure: we make our bondemen free, and we assigne to olde souldiers certain possessions and feldes to lyue vpon, we make oure free minister and seruaunt, af ter that he hath well & faythfullye serued vs, equall as it were vnto vs, and call him to our affinity. Now much more oughtest thou then honorificently to intreate thy wyfe be ing aged and olde, the whiche is no brute beast, no bōdmayd nor of no worse cōdition then thou thy selfe, nor thy hyred seruant, but equall with thee, and assygned by GOD to be thy fellowe, and wyth suche loue coupled vnto thee, as far passeth and exceadeth all other. And reason it is, that she

which hath bene so long obedient and subiecte to her husband, be now euen like and equal with him, for now those agitations & troubles of the mynd (the whiche by the maiestie, and as it were by the kingedome of the husbande should be refrayned) are now through vse and time pacified and cooled, so that now it shal not nede that he rule his wife or studye to obserue and retayne hys maiestye any more: for it canne not nowe dimynyshe, seynge that all suche thynges, as required a iuste and a moderate impyre and rule, are dyspached and taken awaye.
               And therfore GOD commaundedGc. xxi Abraam to obeye

his olde Sara, not as to hys wife & flesh, but as some what eleuated vnto ye nature of mā and condition and qualitie of the spirite. Nor from hence forth she must not be handled nor intreated like a yong woman, in asmuch as she is feble & her bodely heate swaged & couled. And her trauayle and paynes by the ayde & helpe of seruauntes must now be ligh tened, for ye infirmities of her minde yt blinded so her iudgemēt, yt she could not perceyue the trueth, are now healed & her self made better, more cir cūspect, & wiser then she was before. Begynne nowe therfore to make her equal wt thy selfe, & coūsel wt her about thy matters whether they bee

great or smal, for so shal she re ceyue ye frute & reward of her obedience, to be a mistres, the whiche was so longe thy seruaūt. Nor she shal not be now intollerable or insolente or a stately mistres, that so long a tyme before hathe learned to be obedient. Thus by lytle & litle ye shal learne to discerne the sexes, & begynne to prepare you vnto yt celestial life, in the whiche there is no sexe as touchinge carnall vse.

If thou dye before her, leaue suche a testimonye vnto her and all other, not onelye of thy beneuolence but also of thy iudgement to herwardes, ge
