            TO THE RIGHT HONOrable the Lord Henry Hastinges, sonne and heire apparant to the noble Erle of Huntyngton.
            
               THEMISTOCLES THE NOBLE ATHENIEN IN HIS BANISHEMENT ENtertayned moste honourablie with the king of Persia, willed vpon a time to tell his cause by a spokesman, compared it to a piece of tapistrie, that beyng spred abrode, discloseth the beautie of the woorkemanship, but foulded together, hideth it, and therfore demaunded respite to learne the Persian tunge to tell his owne cause: Right so [honorable Lorde] this Courtier hath long straid about this realme, & the fruite of him either little, or vnperfectly receiued to the commune benefite: for either men skilful in his tunge haue delited in him for their owne priuate commoditie, or elles he hath eftsones spoken in peecemeale by an interpreter to suche as desired to knowe his mynde, and to practise his principles: the which how vnperfect a thing it is, The▪ mystocles and experience teache. But nowe, though late in deede, yet for al that at length, beside his three principal languages, in the which he hath a long time haunted all the Courtes of Christendome, hee is beecome an Englishman [whiche many a longe tyme haue wyshed, but fewe attempted and none atchieued] and welwilling to dwell in the Court of Englande, and in plight to tel his own cause. In whose commendation I shall not neede to vse any long processe of woordes, for he can so well speak for himself, and answere to the opinion men haue a long time conceiued of him, that whatsoeuer I shoulde write therein, were but labour in waste, and rather a diminishing, then a setting foorth of his woorthinesse, and a great deale better it were to passe it ouer with silence, then to vse briefenesse. Onely for the litle acquaintaunce I haue with him, and for the general profit is in him, my desier is he should nowe at his firste arriuall, a newe man in this kinde of trade, be well entertained and muche honoured. And forsomuche




as none, but a noble yonge Gentleman, and trayned vp all his life time in Court, and of worthie qualities, is meete to receiue and enterteine so worthy a Courtier, that like maye felowship and gete estimation with his like, I do dedicate him vnto your good lordeship, that through your meanes, and vnder your patronage he maye be commune to a greate meany. And this do I not, for that I suppose you stande in neede of any of his instructions, but partly because you may see him confirme with reason the Courtly facions, comely exercises, and noble vertues, that vnawares haue from time to time crept in to you, and already with practise and learning taken custome in you: And partly to gete him the more aucthoritie and credite throughe so honorable a Patrone. For no doubt, if you beseene willingly to embrace him, other yonge and Courtly Gentlemen will not shonn hys company: And so both he shall gete him the reputation now here in Englande which he hath had a good while since beyonde the sea, in Italy, Spaine and Fraunce, and I shal thinke my smal trauayle wel imployed and sufficiently recompensed. The honour and entertainment that your noble Auncestours shewed Castilio the maker, whan he was in this realme to be installed knight of the Order for the Duke his Maister, was not so muche as presently both he, and this his handywoorke shall receiue of you. Generally ought this to be in estimation with all degrees of men: For to Princes and Greate men, it is a rule to rule themselues that rule others, and one of the bookes that a noble Philosopher exhorted a certaine kyng to prouide him, and diligently to searche, for in them he shoulde finde written suche matters, that friendes durst not vtter vnto kinges: To men growen in yeres, a pathway to the behoulding and musing of the minde, and to whatsoeuer elles is meete for that age: To yonge Gentlemen, an encouraging to garnishe their minde with morall vertues, and their bodye with comely exercises, and both the one and the other with honest qualities to attaine vnto their noble ende: To Ladyes and Gentlewomen, a mirrour to decke and trimme themselues with vertuous condicions, comely behauiours and honest enterteinment toward al men: And to them all in general, a storehouse of most necessary implements for the conuersacion, vse, and training vp of mans life with Courtly demeaners.

GASPAR PALLAVICIN, BEMBO, BIBIENA, and other most excellent Courtiers, and of the noblest families in these dayes in Italy, whiche all afterwarde became Princes, Cardinalles, Bishoppes and greate Lordes, and some yet in lyfe. Both Cicero and Castilio professe, they folowe not any certayne appointed order of preceptes or rules, as is vsed in the instruction of youth, but call to rehearsall, matters debated in their times too and fro in the disputacion of most eloquent men and excellent wittes in euery woorthy qualitie, the one company in the olde tyme assembled in Tusculane, and the other of late yeeres in the newe Palaice of Vrbin. VVhere many most excellent wittes in this realme haue made no lesse of this boke then the Great Alexander did of Homer, I cannot sufficiently wonder that they haue not all this while from tyme to tyme done a commune benefite to profite others as well as themselues. In this pointe [I knowe not by what destinye] Englishemen are muche inferiour to well most all other Nations: For where they set their delite and bende themselues with an honest strife of matching others, to tourne into their mother tunge, not onely the wittie writinges of other languages, but also




of all the Philosophers, and all Sciences bothe Greeke and Latin, our men weene it sufficient to haue a perfecte knowledge, to no other ende, but to profite themselues, and [as it were] after muche paynes in breaking vp a gap, bestow no lesse to close it vp againe, that others maye with like trauaile folowe after. And where our learned menne for the moste part holde opinion, to haue the sciences in the mother tunge, hurteth memorie and hindreth lerning, in my opinion, they do full yll consider from whence the Grecians first, and afterwarde the Latins

               et their knowledge. And without wading to any farther reasons that might be alleaged, yf they will marke well the trueth, they shall see at this daye, where the Sciences are most tourned into the vulgar tunge, there are best learned men, and comparing it wyth the contrarie, they shall also finde the effectes contrarie.

So that to be skilfull and exercised in authours translated, is no lesse to be called learning, then in the very same in the Latin or Greeke tunge. Therefore the translation of Latin or Greeke authours, doeth not onely not hinder learning, but it furthereth it, yea it is learning it self, and a great staye to youth, and the noble ende to the whiche they oughte to applie their wittes, that with diligence and studye haue attained a perfect vnderstanding, to open a gap for others to folow their steppes,

               How much the learned differed frō the vnlearned, So much (quoth he) as the wel broken & ready horses▪ from the vnbroken. Wherfore I wote not how our learned men in this case can auoide the sa

As I therefore haue to my smal skil bestowed some labour about this piece of woorke, euen so coulde I wishe with al my hart, profounde learned men in the Greeke and Latin shoulde make the lyke proofe, and euerye manne store the tunge accordinge to hys knowledge and delite aboue other men, in some piece of learnynge, that we alone of the worlde maye not bee styll counted barbarous in oure tunge, as in time out of minde we haue bene in our maners. And so shall we perchaunce in time become as famous in Englande▪ as the learned men of other nations haue ben and presently are. And though the hardnesse of this present matter be suche, and myne vnskylfulnesse to vndertake this enterprise so greate, that I myghte with good cause haue despaired to bringe to an ende it, that manye excellente wittes haue attempted, yet coulde I not chouse but yelde to the continual

Notwithstanding a great while I forbare and lingered the time to see if anye of a more perfect vnderstanding in the tunge, and better practised in the matter of the booke [of whom we want not a number in this realm] woulde take the matter in hande, to do his countrey so great a benefite: and this imagination preuailed in me a long space after my duetie done in translating the thirde booke [that entreateth of a Gentl

it was as then in some forwardness by an other, whose wit and stile was greatly to be allowed, but sins preuented by death he could not finish it. But of late beeyng instantly craued vpon a fresh, I whetted my stile and settled my self to take in hand the other three bookes (that entreat of the perfection of a Gentilman of the Court) to fulfill their peticion in what I am able, hauing time and leyser therto, the which I haue done, though not in effect▪ yet in apparance and that in a great deale shorter time, then the hardness of the matter required. And where it shall not perhappes throughly please by reason my smalle vnderstandyng in the tung, and less practise in the matters herin conteined, is not of force to giue it the brightness and full perfection in this our tung that it hath in the Italian, it shal suffice yet that I haue showed my self obedient in the respect a manne ought to haue toward his betters: And no more can they auoid the blame to charge me withall, then I to vndertake it. Beside that, I haue declared my good will and well meaning no less then if my counning were greater, and could extend much farther. But parauenture the rudeness of this shall be an encouragyng of some other to giue the onsett vpon other matters with a better ripeness of style & much more aptness, and so shall this yet somewhat profite both wayes. But the estimation it must gete by your honour, is the principall cause that setteth it out, and maketh it worne with the handes of heedfull readers: For in case you cheerfullye receiue it, men will recken it good: Yf you alow it, worthy to be practised: Yf you commend it, woorthie to pass from hand to hand. Therfore emong the other good opinions men generally houlde of you, let it not be the least, that they may houlde also no less of this that you alowe and commende. And so shall you show vndeserued kindness, I, bounden dutie, and all others good will to imbrace & to welcome it out of Italy into Englande And thus shall Cast

But in case iudgementes now feint, or mine interpretation seeme not pithie but rude, not proper, but colde, there is no more imperfection in this Courtier, then in Cirus himself in




the translation of Xenophon into the Italian or anie other tung, the one as necessarie and proper for a Gentilman of the Court, as the other for a king.

               AFter the Lorde Guidubaldo of Montefeltro Duke of Urbin was departed out of this life, certein other Gentilmen and I that had bine seruauntes to him, continued in seruyce wyth Duke Francescomaria Della Rouere hys heire & successor in the state:

                     .
                And whyle the sauour of the vertues of Duke Guidubaldo was fresh in my mynde, and the great delite I took in those yeeres in the louing companie of so excellent Personages as then were in the Court of Urbin: I was prouoked by the memorie therof to write these bookes of the Courtier. The which I accomplished in a fewe dayes, myndinge in time to amende those faultes that spronge of the desire that I had speedilie to paye this debt. But fortune now manie yeeres hath alwayes kept me vnder in suche continuall trauayles, that I coulde neuer gete leyser to bringe it to the passe that my feeble iudgement might be throughlie satisfied with all. At such time therfore as I was in Spayne, being aduertised out of Italy how




the Lady Uittoria Colonna Marquesse of Pescara,
                  L. vittoria Colonna.
                vnto whom in foretime I had graunted a Copie of this booke, contrarie to her promise, had made a great part of it to be copied out: it greeued me somwhat whether I would or no, standinge in doubt of the sundrie inconueniences that in the like cases may happen. Yet had I a hope that the witt & wisdome of that Lady (whose troth I haue alwaies had in reuerence, as a matter from aboue) was sufficient to prouide, not to be harmfull vnto me my beeinge obedient to her commaundement. At last I hard an yncklinge that part of the booke was rief in Naples in many mens handes: and as men are alwayes desirous of noueltie, it was thought that they attempted to imprint it. Wherfore I, amased at this mischaunce, determined wyth my self to ouerlooke by and by that litle in the booke that time serued me therto, with entent to set it abrode, thinking it lesse hurtful to haue it somwhat corrected with mine owne hande, then much mangled with an other mannes. Therfore to haue this my pourpose take effect, I tooke in hande to reade it ouer afresh, and sodeinlie at the first blush by reason of the title, I tooke no title grief, which in proceadinge forward encreased much more, remembringe that the greater part of them that are brought in to reason, are now dead. For beside those that are mentioned in the Proheme of the last booke,

Alphonsus Ariosto him self is dead, vnto whom the booke was dedicated,

                  Cardinal of S. Maria in Portico.
                Also M. Bernard, Cardinall of S. Maria in Portico, who for his liuelie and pleasant promptness of witt, was most acceptable vnto as manie as knew him,
                  Duke of Genua.
                and dead he is. The Lord Octauian Fregoso is also dead, a man in oure tymes verie rare, of a most noble courage, of a pure lief, full of goodnesse, witt, wisdome and Courtesie, and a verie frende vnto honour and vertue, and so worthy prayse, that his verie ennemies could say none other of hym, then what sounded to his renoume: And the mishappes he hath borne out with great steadinesse, were sufficient inoughe to geue euidence, that Fortune, as she hath alwayes bene, so is she in these dayes also an enemie to vertue. There are dead in like maner manie other that are named in this boke, vnto whō a man wold haue thought that nature had promised a verie longe lief. But the thinge that should not be rehersed wythout teares is,
                  Dutchesse of Vrbin.
                that the Dutchesse she is also dead. And if my minde be troubled with the losse of so manye frindes and good Lordes of myne, that haue left me in this lief, as it were in a




wildernes full of sorow, reason would it should with much more grief beare the heauinesse of the Dutchesse death, then of al the rest, bicause she was more woorth then all the rest, and I was much more bounde vnto her then vnto all the rest. Therfore for leesinge time to bestowe that of dutye I ought vpon the memorye of so excellent a Ladye, and of the rest that are no more in lief, prouoked also by the ieopardye of the booke, I haue made him to be imprinted, and setforth in such sort, as the shortnes of time hath serued me. And bicause you had no acqueintance, neither with the Dutches, nor with any of the rest that are dead, sauing only with Duke Iulian, and with the Cardinal of S. Maria in Portico. while they liued, therfore to the entent, in what I can do, you may haue acqueintance with them after their death, I send vnto you this booke, as a purtraict in peinctinge of the Court of Urbin: Not of the handiwoorke of Raphael, or Michael Angelo, but of an vnknowen peincter, and that can do no more but draw the principall lines, without settingfurth the truth with beawtifull coulours, or makinge it appeere by the art of Prospectiue that it is not. And wher I haue enforced my self to setfurth together with the comunication the propreties & condicions of such as are named in it, I confess I haue not only not fully expressed, but not somuch as touched the vertues of the




Dutchesse Bicause not onlye my stile is vnsufficient to express them, but also mine vnderstanding to conceiue them. And if in this behalf, or in anie other matter woorthy reprehention (as I know well there want not manie in the booke) fault be found in me, I will not speake against the truth. But bicause men somtime take such delite in finding fault, that they find fault also in that deserueth not reproof, vnto some yt blame me bicause I haue not folowed Boccaccio,
                  Boccaccio.
                nor bound my self to the maner of the Tuscane speach vsed nowadayes,
                  Tuscane tung.
                I will not let to say, for all Boccaccio was of a fine witt, according to those times, and in some part writt with great aduisement and diligence: yet did he write much better whan he lett him self be guided with witt and his owne naturall inclination, without anie other maner studie or regarde to polish his writinges, then whan with al trauaile and bent studye he enforced him self to be most fine and eloquent. For his verie fauourers affirme that in his own matters he was far deceiued in iudgement, litle regarding such thinges as haue gotten him a name, and greatlye esteaminge that is nothing woorth. Had I then folowed that trade of writing which is blamed in him by such as praise him in the rest, I could not haue eschewed the verye same reprooffes that are laied to Boccaccio himself as touching this. And I had deserued somuch the more, for




that his errour was then, in beleauyng he did well, and mine should be nowe, in knowinge I do amisse. Again if I had folowed that trade which is reckened of many to be good, and was litle regarded of him, I should appeere in folowing it to disagree from the iudgement of him whom I folowed: the which thing (in mine opinion) were an inconuenience. And beeside yf this respect had not moued me, I could not folowe him in the matter, forsomuch as he neuer wrott any thing in treatise like vnto these bookes of the Courtier: And in the tunge, I ought not in mine aduise, bicause the force or rule of speach doeth consist more in vse, then in anye thinge els: and it is alwayes a vice to vse woordes that are not in commune speach. Therfore it was not meete I should haue vsed many that are in Boccaccio, which in his time were vsed, and now are out of vse emonge the Tuscanes them selues. Neyther would I binde my self to the maner of the Tuscane tunge in vse nowe a dayes, bicause the practising emonge sundrye Nations, hath alwayes bene of force to transport from one to an other (in a maner) as merchaundise, so also new woordes,
                  New Woordes.
                which afterward remaine or decaye, according as they are admitted by custome or refused. And this beside the record of auntient writers, is to be euidently seene in Boccaccio, in whom there are so manie woordes French, Spanish, and prouincial,




and some perhappes not well vnderstood of the Tuscanes in these dayes, that whoso woulde pick them out, should make the booke much the lesser. And bicause (in mine opinion) the kinde of speach of the other noble Cities of Italy, where there resorte men of wisdome, vnderstandinge and eloquence, which practise great matters of gouernment of states, of letters, armes, and diuerse affayres, ought not altogether to be neglected for the woordes whiche in these places are vsed in cōmune speach: I suppose that they maye be vsed welinough, writing such as haue a grace and comlynesse in the pronuntiation, and communly counted good and of propre signification, though they be not Tuscane, and haue also their origion out of Italy. Beeside this in Tuscane they vse many woordes cleane corrupte from the Latin,
                  Deriued wordes from the Latin.
                the which in Lumbardye and in the other partes of Italy remaine wholl and without anye chaunge at al, and they are so vniuersallye vsed of euerye man, that of the best sorte they are allowed for good, & of the commune people vnderstood with out difficulty. Therfore I thinke I haue committed no errour at all. Yf in writing I haue vsed any of these, and rather taken the wholl and pure woord of mine owne Countrey, then the corrupt & mangled of an other. Neyther doeth that rule seeme good vnto me, where many say ye vulgar tung, the lesse it is like vnto the Latin,




the more beawtiful it is: And I can not perceiue why more authoritie should consist in one custome of speach, then in an other. For if Tuscane be sufficient to authorise corrupt & mangled▪ Latin woordes, and to geue them so greate a grace, that mangled in such sort euerye man may vse them for good (the which no man denieth) should not Lumbardy or any other countrey haue the authoritye to allow the very Latin woordes that be pure, sounde, propre and not broken in any part so, but they may be well borne? And assuredly as it may be called a rash presumption to take in hand to forge new wordes, or to set vp ye olde in spite of custome: So is it no lesse, to take in hande against the force of the same custome to bring to naught, and (as it were) to burye aliue such as haue lasted nowe many yeeres, & haue ben defended from the malice of the time with the shield of vse, & haue preserued their estimation and dignitye, whan in the warres and turmoiles of Italy, alterations were brought vp both of the tunge, buildinges, garmentes and maners. And beeside the hardnesse of the matter, it seemeth to be (as it were) a certein wickednesse. Therfore where I haue not thought good in my writing to vse the wordes of Boccaccio which are vsed no more in Tuscane, nor to binde my self to their law that think it not lawful to vse them that ye Tuscan
                  •
               s




vse not nowadayes, me thynke I ought to be held excused. But I suppose both in the matter of the booke and in the tunge, forsomuch as one tung may help an other, I haue folowed Authores asmuch woorthie praise, as Boccaccio. And I beleaue it ought not to be imputed vnto me for an errour, that I haue chosen to make my self rather knowen for a Lumbard, in speaking of Lumbard, then for no Tuscan, in speaking of tomuch Tuscan. Bicause I wil not do as Theophrastus did,
                  Cicero in Biuto.
                which for speaking tomuch the meere Athenian tunge, was of a simple olde woman knowen not to be of Athens. But bycause in thys point there is sufficyent talke in the first booke, I will make no more a do. And to auoid al contention I confesse to my faultfinders, that I haue no knowleage in this their Tuscan tunge so hard and secrete: and I say that I haue written it in mine owne, and as I speak, & vnto such as speake as I speake: and so I trust I haue offended no man. For I beleaue it is forbed no man that is, to wryte & speake in his owne tunge, neyther is anye man bound to reade or heare that contenteth hym not. Therfore if they will not reade my Courtier, they shall offende me nothing at all. Other say, bicause it is so hard a matter and (in a maner) vnpossible to finde out a man of such perfection, as I would haue the Courtier to be,
                  Courtier.
                it is but superfluous to write it: For it is a vaine




thing to teach that can not be learned. To these men I answere, I am content, to err with Plato, Xenophon, and M. Tullius, leauing apart the disputing of the intelligible world and of the Ideas or imagined fourmes: in which nū
               ber, as (according to that opinion) the Idea or figure conceyued in imagination of a perfect commune weale, and of a perfect king, and of a perfect Oratour are conteined: So is it also of a perfect Courtier. To the image wherof if my power could not draw nigh in stile, so much the lesse peynes shall Courtiers haue to drawe nigh in effect to the ende and marke that I in writing haue set beefore them. And if with all this they can not compasse that perfection, such as it is, which I haue endeuoured to expresse, he that cummeth nighest shall be the most perfect: As emong many Archers that shute at one marke, where none of them hitteth the pinn, he that is nighest is out of doubt better then ye rest. Some again say that my meaning was to facion my self, perswading my self that all suche qualities as I appoint to the Courtier are in me. Unto these men I will not cleane deny that I haue attempted all that my mynde is the Courtier shoulde haue knowleage in. And I thinke who so hath not the knowleage of the thinges intreated vpon in this booke, how learned so euer he be, he can full il write them. But I am not of so sclender a iudgment in knowing




my self, that I wil take vpon me to know what soeuer I can wish. The defēce therfore of these accusations & perauēture of many mo, I leaue for this once▪ to the iudgement of the commune opinion: bicause for the most part the multytude, though they haue no perfect knowleage, yet do they feele by the instinct of nature a certein sauour of good and ill, and can geue none other reason for it: One tasteth and taketh delite, an other refuseth & is against his stomake.
            Therfore if the booke shall generally please, I wil count him good, and think that he ought to liue: But if he shall displease, I will count him naught, and beleaue that the memorye of him shall soone perish. And if for all this mine accusers will not be satisfied with this commune iudgemente, let them content them selues with the iudgement of time, which at length discouereth the priuie faultes of euery thing: And bicause it is father to truth and a iudge without passion, it accustometh euermore to pronounce true sentence of the life or death of writynges.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            ¶ THE FIRST BOOKE OF THE Courtier of Count Baldessar Castilio, vnto Maister Alphonsus Ariosto.
            
               
                  I Haue a longe time doubted with my self [most louing M. Alphonsus] which of the two were harder for me, either to denye you the thinge that you haue with suche instance manye tymes required of me, or to take it in hande: Bicause on the one side me thoughte it a verye harde matter to denye anye thynge, especiallye the request beinge honest, to the personne whom I loue deerlye, and of whom I perceyue my selfe deerlye beloued. Againe on the other syde, to vndertake an enterpryse whiche I do not knowe my selfe able to brynge to an end, I iudged it vncomely for him that wayeth due reproofes so much as they oughte to be wayed. At length after muche debatynge, I haue determined to proue in this behalfe what ayde that affection and great desyre to please, can brynge vnto my dilygence, whyche in other thynges is wonte to encrease the laboure of menne. You then require me to wryte, what is (to my thynkynge) the trade and maner of Courtyers, whyche is most syttynge for a Gentilman that lyueth in the Court of Princes, by the whiche he maye haue the knoweleage howe to serue them perfectlye in euerye reasonable matter, and obtaine thereby fauour of them and prayse of other men. Fynallye, of what sort he ought to be that deserueth to be called so perfect a Courtyer, that there be no wante in him? wherefore I, considering this kinde of request, say, that in case it sh
                  •
               ulde not appeare to my selfe a greater blame to haue you esteame me to be of smal frendeshippe, then all other men of litle wysdome, I woulde haue ryd my handes of this laboure▪ for feare leas

counted rashe of all such as knowe, what a harde matter it is, emonge suche diuersitye of maners, that are vsed in the Courtes of Christendome, to picke out the perfectest trade and way, and (as it were) the floure of this Courtiership. Because vse maketh vs manye times to delite in, and to set litle by the self same thinges: wherby somtime it preceadeth that maners, garmentes, customes, and facions whiche at sometyme haue beene in price, becūme not regarded, and contrarywyse the not regarded, becūme of price. Therfore it is manifestlye to be descerned, that vse hath greater force then reason, to brynge vp neweinuentions emonge vs, and to abolishe the olde, of the whiche who so goeth about to iudge the perfection, is often tymes deceyued. For which consideration, perceyuinge this and manye other lettes in the matter propounded for me to write vpon, I am constreyned to make a peece of an excuse, and to open playnelye that this errour (yf it may be termed an errour) is commune to vs both, that if anye blame happen to me about it, it may be also partned with you. For it ought to be reckned a no lesse offence in you to laye vppon me a burden that passeth my strengthe, then in me to take it vpon me. Let vs therfore at length settle oure selues to begin that is oure purpose and drifte, and (if it be possible) let vs facion suche a Courtier, as the Prince that shalbe worthye to haue him in his seruyce, although hys state be but small, maye notwythstandynge be called a myghtye Lorde. We will not in these bookes folow any certaine order or rule of appointed preceptes, the whiche for the moste part is wont to be obserued in the teaching of anye thinge whatsoeuer it be: but after the maner of men of olde time, renuinge a gratefull memorye, we will repeat certaine reasoninges that were debated in times past betwene men verye excellent for that purpose. And althoughe I was not there present, but at the time when they were debated, it was my chaunce to




be in Englande, yet soone after my retourne, I hearde them of a person that faythfullye reported them vnto me. And I will endeuoure my selfe, for so muche as my memorye wyll serue me, to call them perticularly to remembraunce, that you maye see what, men worthy greate commendacion, and vnto whose iudgement a man maye in euerye poynt geue an vndoubted credyt, haue iudged and beleued in this matter.

            As euerye man knoweth the lytle Citye of Vrbin is sytuated vpon the side of the Appennine (in a maner) in the middes of Italy towardes the Golf of Venice.
               Situation of Urbin. The which for all it is placed emonge hylles, and those not so pleasaunt as perhappes some other that we behoulde in manye places,
                  Mare adriaticum.
                yet in this point the element hathe bene fauourable vnto it, that all aboute, the countrye is verye plentyfull and full of fruites: so that beside the holsomenesse of aer, it is verye aboundant and stored wyth all thinges necessarye for the lief of man. But amonge the greatest felycityes that men can recken it to haue, I counte thys the chief, that now a longe tyme it hath alwayes bene gouerned with very good Princes, although in the commune calamyties of the warres of Italy it remayned also a season with out anye at all. But without searching further of this we maye make a good proofe wyth the famous memorye of Duke Fridericke, who in his dayes was the light of Italy. Neyther do we want true and verye large testimonies yet remayninge of his wisdome, courtesye,Duke Frydericke. iustice, liberalitye, of his inuincible courage and pollycy of warr. And of this do his so many vyctoryes make proofe, chyeflye his conquerynge of places impregnable, his sodeyne redynesse in settynge forwarde to geue battaile,




his putting to flyght sundrye tymes wyth a small numbre, verie greate and puissaunte armyes, and neuer susteined losse in any conflict: So that we may, not without cause, compare hym to manye famous men of olde time. This man emong his other deedes praisworthy, in the hard & sharpe situation of Vrbin buylt a Palaice, to the opinion of many men,The palaice of Urbin. the fayrest that was to be founde in all Italy, and so fornished it with euerye necessary implement belonging therto, that it appeared not a palaice, but a Citye in fourme of a palaice, and that not onelye with ordinarie matters, as Siluer plate, hanginges for chambers of verye riche cloth of golde, of silke and other like, but also for sightlynesse: and to decke it out withall, placed there a wonderous number of auncyent ymages of marble and mettall, verye excellente peinctinges and instrumentes of musycke of all sortes, and nothinge would he haue there but what was moste rare and excellent. To this with verye great charges he gathered together a great number of most excellent and rare bookes, in Greke, Latin and Hebrue, the which all he garnished wyth golde and syluer, esteaming this to be the chieffest ornament of his great palaice. This duke then folowing the course of nature when he was .lxv. yeares of age, as he had liued, so did he end his lief with glorye. And left Duke after him a childe of .x. yeares,Guidubaldo duke of Urbin. hauynge no more male, and wythout mother, who hight Guidubaldo. Thys chylde as of the state, so did it appeare also that he was heyre of all his fathers vertues: and sodenly wyth a marueylous towardnes beeganne to promise so much of himselfe, as a manne woulde not haue thought possyble to be hoped of a man mortall. So that the opinyon of men was, that of all duke Friderickes notable dedes there was none greater then that he begat suche a son. But fortune enuyinge this so great vertue, wythall her myght gainstoode this so gloryous a beginnynge, in suche wyse




that before duke Guidubaldo was .xx. yeares of age, he fell sicke of the gout, the which encreasinge vppon him wyth most bitter paynes, in a short tyme so nummed hym of all hys members,Troubled with the goute. that he coulde neyther stande on foote nor moue hymselfe. And in this maner was one of the beste fauoured and towardlyest personages in the world deformed and marred in his greene age. And beside, not satisfyed with thys, fortune was so contrarye to him in all his pourposes, that verye sildome he brought to passe any thynge to hys minde. And for all he had in him moste wise counsayle, and an inuincible courage, yet it seemed that whatsoeuer he tooke in hande bothe in feates of armes and in euerye other thynge small or greate,His ill lucke. it came alwayes to yll successe. And of thys make proofe his manye and dyuers calamityes, which he alwayes bore out with suche stou

               enesse of courage, that vertue neuer yelded to fortune. But wyth a boulde stomake despising her stormes, lyued wyth great dignytye and estimation emonge all men: in sickenesse, as one that was sounde, and in aduersitye, as one that was most fortunate. So that for all he was thus diseased in his bodye, he serued in time of warre wyth moste honourable enterteinmente vnder the most famous kinges of Naples,
               Hys seruice with princes and commune weales. 
               Alphonsus and Ferdinande the yonger. Afterward with Pope Alexander the .vi. with the lordes of Venice and Florence. And when Iulius the ii. was created Pope, he was then made generall Captayne of the Churche: at whych tyme proceadynge in hys accustomed vsage, he sett hys delyte aboue all thynges to haue hys house furnished with most noble and valyaunte Gentylmen, wyth whom he lyued very famylyarly, enioying theyr conuersation, wherein the pleasure whyche he gaue vnto other menne was no lesse,His propreties and qualityes. then that he receyued of other, because he was verye wel seene in both tunges, and together wyth a louynge behauyour and plesauntnesse he had also accompanied the knowleage of infinite




thinges. And beside this, the greatnesse of his courage so quickened hym, that where he was not in case with hys personne to practise the feates of Chiualrye, as he had done longe before, yet dyd he take verye great delyte to behoulde them in other men, and with his wordes sometyme correctinge, and otherwhyle praysinge euerye man accordynge to hys desertes, he declared euydentlye howe greate a iudgement he hadde in those matters. And vpon this at Tylt, at Tourneye, in rydynge, in playinge at all sortes of weapon, also in inuenting deuyces, in pastymes, in musicke, fynallye in all exercises meete for noble Gentilmen, euerye manne stryued to showe hymselfe suche a one, as myght deserue to bee iudged woorthye of so noble an assemblye. Therfore were all the houres of the daye deuyded into honourable and pleasaunt exercyses, aswell of the bodye as of the mynde. But because the Duke vsed continuallye, by reason of his infirmytye, soone after supper to go to his rest, euerye man ordinarelye,Elizabeth gonzaga dutchesse of Urbin. at that houre drewe where the Dutchesse was, the Lady Elizabeth Gonzaga. Where also continuallye was the Lady Emilia Pia, who for that she was endowed with so liuelye a wytt and iudgement as you knowe, seemed the maistresse and ringe leader of all the companye,L. Emilia Pia. and that euerye manne at her receyued vnderstandinge and courage. There was then to be hearde pleasaunte communication and merye conceytes, and in euery mannes countenaunce a manne myght perceyue peyncted a louynge iocoundenesse. So that thys house truelye myght well be called the verye mansion place of Myrth and Ioye. And I beleaue it was neuer so tasted in other place, what maner a thynge the sweete conuersatyon that is occasyoned of an amyable and louynge companye, as it was once there.

But such was the respect which we bore to the Dutchesse wyll, that the selfe same libertye was a verye great bridle. Neither was there anye that thought it not the greatest pleasure he coulde haue in the worlde, to please her, and the greatest griefe to offende her. For this respecte were there most honest condicions coupled with wonderous greate libertye, and deuises of pastimes and laughinge matters tempred in her sight, besyde most wyttye iestes, with so comelye and graue a maiesty, that the verye sober moode and greatnesse that dyd knyt together all the actes, woordes and gestures of the Dutchesse in iesting and laughynge, made them also that had neuer seene her in their lief before, to count her a verye greate Ladye. And all that came in her presence hauyng this respect fyred in their breast, it seemed she had made them to her becke▪ so that euery man enforced himself to folowe this trade, takynge (as it were) a rule and enample of faire condicions at the presence of so greate and so vertuous a Lady. Whose most excellent qualities I entend, not nowe to expresse, for it is neyther my pourpose, and againe they are well inoughe knowen to the worlde, and muche better then I am able either with tunge or with pen to endite. And such as would perhaps haue lien hid a space, fortune, as she that wondreth at so rare vertues, hath thought good with many aduersities and temptatyons of miseries to disclose them, to make trial therby that




in the tender breast of a woman, in companye wyth synguler beawtye, there can dwell wysdome, and stoutenes of courage, and all other vertues that in graue men them selues are most seldome. But leauynge this apart, I say that the maner of all the Gentilmen in the house was immedyatelye after supper to assemble together where the dutchesse was. Where emonge other recreations, musicke and dauncynge, whiche they vsed contynuallye, sometyme they propounded feate questions, otherwhyle they inuented certayne wytty sportes and pastimes, at the deuyse sometyme of one sometyme of an other, in the whych vnder sundrye couertes, often tymes the standers bye opened subtylly theyr imaginations vnto whom they thought beste. At other tymes there arrose other disputations of diuers matters, or els iestinges with prompt inuentions. Manye tymes they fell into pourposes, as we nowe a dayes terme them, where in thys kynde of talke & debating of matters,Noble personages in the Court of Urbin. there was wonderous great pleasure on all sydes: Because (as I haue sayde) the house was replenyshed wyth most noble wyttes. Emonge whych (as you knowe) were moste famous the Lord Octauian, Fregoso, Sir Friderick his brother the L. Iulian de Medicis, M. Peter Bembo, the L. Cesar Gonzaga, Count Lewis of Canossa, the L. Gaspar Pallauicin, the L. Lodouicus pius, M. Morello of Ortona, Peter of Naples, M. Robert of Bari, and infynyte other moste woorthye knyghtes and Gentylmen. Beesyde these there were manye that for all ordinarilye they dwelled not there, yet spent they most of their tyme there, as, M. Bernard Bibiena, Vnico Aretino, Iohnchristopher Romano, Peter Mount, Therpander, M. Nicholas Phrisio, so that thither ran continually poetes, musitiens, & al kinde of men of skyll, and the excellentest in euery faculty that were in al Italy. After pope Iulius the ii. had with his owne presence by the ayde of the Frenchmen brought Bolonia to the obedyence of the Apostolyke Sea again, in the yeare MDvi. in hys retourn




toward Roome he tooke Vrbin in his way, where he was receaued as honorably as was possible, and with as sumptuous and costlye preparation, as coulde haue bine in any other Citie of Italy whatsoeuer it be. So that beeside the Pope, all the Cardinalles and other Courtyers thought themselues throughly satisfied. And some there were that prouoked wyth the sweetenesse of this companye, after the Pope and the Court was departed, contynued manye dayes together in Vrbin. At which time they did not onely proceade in their accustomed trade of disportinge and ordinary recreations, but also euery man sett to his helpinge hande to augment them somewhat, and especially in pastymes, which they had vp almost euerye nyght. And the order therof was such, that assoone as they were assembled where the Dutches was, euery man satt him downe at his will, or as it fell to his lot, in a circle together, and in s
                  •
               ttinge were deuyded a man and a woman, as longe as there were women, for alwayes (lightlye) the number of men was farr the greater. Then were they gouerned as the Dutchesse thought best, whiche manye times gaue this charge vnto the L. Emilia. So the daye after the Pope was departed, the companye beeinge gathered to the accustomed place, after muche pleasaunt talke, the Dutchesse pleasure was that the L. Emilia should beginne these pastimes:Diuises of pastimes. and she after a litle refusing of that charge, sayd in this maner: Syth it is your pleasure (Madam) I shall be she that must giue the onsett in oure pastimes this night, bicause I ought not of reason disobey you, I thinke meete to propounde a pastyme, whereof I suppose shall ensue litle blame, and lesse trauayle. And that shall be to haue euery man, as nigh as he can, propounde a deuyse not yet hearde of, then shall we chuse out such a one as shall be thought meete to be taken in hande in this companye. And after she had thus spoken, she tourned her vnto the L. Gaspar Pallauicin, willynge him to propounde his: who immediatlye made answere:




But first (madam) you must beeginne to propound yours. Then saide the L. Emilia: I haue alreadye done. But your grace must commaunde hym (Madam) to be obedient. Then the Dutchesse laughynge to thintent (quoth she) euery man shal obey you, I make you my deputy, and giue vnto you all mine aucthority. It is surely a great matter, aunswered the L. Gaspar, that it is alwaies lawfull for women to haue this priuilege, to be exempt and free from paines takyng, and truelye reason woulde we should in any wise knowe why. But bicause I will not be he that shall geue example to disobey, I shal leaue thys vntill an other time,The L. Gaspars deuise. and will speake of that I am nowe charged withall, and thus I beginne. Mine oppinion is, that oure mindes, as in other thinges, so also in louynge are diuerse in iudgemente, and therefore it chaunceth often tymes, that the thynge whyche is most acceptable vnto one, is most abhorred of an other. Yet for all that they alwayes agree in that euerye man counteth most deere the wight beloued. So that many times the ouermuch affection in louers doth so deceiue their iudgemente, that they weene the person whom they loue, to be so garnished wyth all excellent vertues and wythout faulte, that he hath no peere in the worlde But bycause the nature of man doth not admytte suche full perfectyons, and there is no mann that hath not some defaulte or want in hym, it can not be sayde that suche as these be are not deceyued, and that the louer doeth not become blynde as touchynge the beloued. I would therefore oure pastyme should be thys nyghte to haue euerye manne open what vertues he would principally the persone he loueth should be indowed with all. And seeyng it is so necessarilye that we all haue some spotte, what vyce he woulde also haue in hym: to see who can fynde out most prayse woorthye and manlye vertues, and most tollerable vyces, that shoulde be least hurtefull bothe to hym that loueth, and to the wyghte beloued.

Emilia will not take the paine to fynde out some pastime, reason willeth that the other Ladyes should be partakers of the same priuilege, and be also fre from this burden for this night: especially seing there are so manye men in place, for assure your self we shall want no pastimes. So shall we do, aunswered the L. Emilia, and puttinge the L. Constance to silence tourned her to the L. Cesar Gonzaga, that sat next her, commaunding him to speak,The L. Cesar Gonzagas deuise. and thus he began: Whoso wyll diligentlye consider all our doynges, he shall fynde alwayes in them sundrye imperfections. And that happeneth, bicause nature doth varye, as well in this, as in all other thinges. Unto one she hath geuen the lyght of reason in one thyng, and vnto an other, in an other thyng.

Emilia commaunded him to silence, and ouerscipping the Lady that satt there,Unico Arettinos deuise made a signe to Vnico aretino that was next in order, and he without looking for anye more biddyng, I (quoth he) would gladlye be a iudge of aucthoritye that I might with all kinde of tourment bolte out the truth of offenders: and that, to discouer the deceytes of an vngrate woman, who with the eies of an angel, and hearte of a Serpent, neuer agreeth her tounge with her mynde, and with a feygned deceyuable compassion, purposeth nothyng els but to make Anatomie of hartes. Neither is there in all the sandie countrey of Libia to be found so venomous a serpent that is so desirous of mans bloud, as is this false creature. Which not onely for the sweetenesse of voice and pleasant soune of woordes, but also for her eyes, for her laughing, for her countenaunce, and for all her gestures is a most perfect meremayden. Therfore seyng it is not lawfull for me, as I would, to vse chaines, ropes, or fier, to vnderstand a matter of trouth, my desire is to compasse the knowledge of it with a mirye pastyme, whiche is this: That euery man shoulde expresse his fansye what the S dothe signify that the dutchesse carieth in her foreheade. For although this be also an artificial couert, the better to beguile, perhappes there may be an interpretacion whiche she neuer thought vpon. And who knoweth whether fortune, with pity behoulding the tormentes of men, hath stirrid her with this small token to discouer against her wyll the inwarde desire she hathe to slea and bury alyue in calamitie hym that honoureth and serueth her. The dutchesse laughed▪ and Vnico, perceiuing she would haue excused her self of thys interpretacion, no (quoth he) speake you not (madam) for it is not your turne to speake nowe. The L. Emilia then tourned her and sayd. M▪ Vnico, there is none of vs all here that geueth not place to you in eueryethyng, and especiallye in knowynge the




disposicion of the Dutchesse. And as you by your dyuyne wit knowe her better then all the rest, so do you loue her better then al the rest, whych lyke byrdes of a feble sight, that cannot looke stedfastlye into the circle of the Sunne, cannot so well perceyue the perfection of it. Therfore all laboure were in vaine in cleeryng of thys doubt, sauyng your iudgement alone. Thys interprise then is reserued onely to you, as vnto him that alone can brynge it to an ende, and none other. Vnico, after he had pawsed a while being stil called vpon to say his fansy, at length rehersed a rime vpon the aforesaide matter, expoundynge what signified the letter S. the which many iudged to be made at the first sight. But bicause it was more witty & better knitt then a man would haue beleued the shortnes of time required, it was thought he had prepared it before. So after mens fauourable voyce geuen in the praise of this rime, and after sufficient talke, the L. Octauian Fregoso whose tourne was then next, began in this sorte smilyng:The L. Octauian Fregosos deuise. My lordes, if I should say vnto you that I neuer felt passion of loue in my daies, I am sure the Dutchesse and the L. Emilia, althoughe they beleued it not in deede, yet would they make semblant to beleue it, and would saye that it proceded bicause I mistrusted I should neuer frame any woman to loue me. The which trulye I haue not hytherto proued with such instance, that of reason I should dispare to obtain it once. Neither haue I forborne the doynge of it, bicause I set so much by my self and so litle by women, that I thinke none worthye to bestowe my loue and seruice vpon. But rathe

And if they speake, accompanyinge euerye woorde wyth certeyne treblefolde syghes, they reason of nothing elles, but of teares, of tourmentes, of desperacions, and of longyng for death. So that whansoeuer any sparckle of loue hath beegonne




to kyndle in my breast, I haue by and by enforced my self with all dyligence to quenche it, not for anye hatred that I haue conceyued agaynst women (as these Ladyes suppose) but for myne owne health. On the other side, I haue knowen some other cleane contrarye to these sorowfull, whiche do not onelye auaunce and content theymselues with the cherefull lookes, louinge woordes, and sweete countenances of their ladies, but also sauce their sorowes with sweetenesse, so that they count the debates, the angers and the disdeignes of them, most sweete. Therefore these men seme vnto me to be much more then happy, for whereas they fynde so muche sweetenesse in the amorous disdeignes, whiche some men recken much more bytter then death, I beleue in louyng gestures they should feele that wonderfull blisse, whyche we seeke for in vayne in thys worlde. Therefore would I oure pastyme were this nyght to haue euerye manne shew, where there muste be a dysdeygne againste hym in the person beloued, what the cause should be that should make the persone conceiue thys disdeygne. For if there be anye here that haue proued those sweete disdeignes, I am sure they wil desire for courtesy one of these causes that make them so sweet. And perhappes I shall with a better will proceade somewhat farther in loue, in hope that I shall also fynde thys sweetenesse, where as some finde bitternesse, and so shall not these Ladies geue me anye more this slaunderous reporte, that I am not in loue.M. Peter Bembos deuyse. This pastime was muche praysed, and therefore dyd euerye man setle himselfe to reason vppon this matter. But the Lady Emilia holdyng her peace M.

they are the more & the lesse bitter according to the cause wherof they arrise. For I haue in my daies (I remember) seene the woman whom I serued, stirred against me, eyther vpon a vaine suspicyon that she conceyued her self of my trustinesse, or elles vpon some other false opinyon that had bine put into her head by some mennes report to my hindraunce, so that I beleaued no grief might be compared to myne. And me thought that the greatest sorowe I felt was to suffer wythout deseruyng, and to sustayne this affliction, not for any offence of mine, but for the small loue that was in her. At other times I saw her disdeignefull for some ouersight of mine, and knew that her anger proceaded of myne offence, and at that instante I iudged the former ve

And me thought to be in displeasure, and that for myne owne trespas, wyth the persone whom onelye I coueted and with suche diligence sought to please, was the greatest torment of all other. Therefore woulde I oure pastyme were to haue euerye man declare his opinion, where there must be a disdeigne agaynst hym in the person beloued, of whom he woulde the cause of this disdeigne shoulde haue his beeginning, whether of her or of him selfe: to know which is the greater grief, eyther to dysplease the wight beloued, or to receyue dyspleasure of the wyght beloued.

And in suche thinges as shall not appere necessarie, that it may be lawfull for euery man to replye against them, as the maner of Philosophers schooles is against him that kepeth disputacions. Syr Friderick proceaded styll forwarde, in his talke, whan the L. Emilia: interruptyng hym, sayde: If it bee my L. the dutchesse pleaser, this shall be our pastime for this once.

Who tournynge her towarde the dutchesse, sayde: Commaunde you (madam) whom shall please you to take this enterprise in hande, for I wyll not by chousing more one then an other, declare my selfe to iudge in this behalf, whom I thinke to be better skilled then the rest, and so do wrong to some.

Not for that we knowe ye are so good a Courtyer that you haue at your fingers endes that belongeth thereto: but because in repeatinge euerye thing arsiuersy, as we hope ye wyll, we shall haue somuch the more pastyme, and euerye one shall be able to answere you, where if an other more skilfull then you should take it in hande, there should bee nothing sayde againste hym for tellyng the trueth, and so shoulde we haue but a colde pastime. The Count aunswered by and by: we neede not feare (madam) that we shal wante contrarying in wordes againste hym that telleth the trueth, as longe as you bee here. And after they had laughed a whyle at this answer, he proceded on: but truely I would with all my hearte bee ridde of this burthen, for it is to hard for me. And I know that to be most true in me which you haue spoken in iest: namelye, that I haue no vnderstandynge in that belongeth to a good Courtyer.

And me thynke my lucke is good that it is late, because the shortenesse of tyme shall make me vse fewe woordes, and the sodeinnesse of the matter shall so excuse me, that it shall be lawfull for me to speak withoute blame whatsoeuer commeth firste to mynde. Because I wyll not therefore carye this burthen of duetye anye longer vppon my shoulders, this I saye:The true perfeccion in thinges. in euerye thynge it is so harde a matter to knowe the true perfeccion, that it is almoste vnpossible, and that by reason of the varietie of iudgementes.

The which you shal folowe if ye thinke it good, or els sticke to youre owne, yf it shal vary from mine.

I wyll haue this our Courtyer therfore to be a Gentlemā borne & of a good house.The facionīg of a Courtyer For it is a great deale lesse dyspraise for him that is not born a gentleman to faile in the actes of vertue then for a gentleman.A Gentleman borne. If he swarne from the steppes of his auncestours, he stayneth the name of his familie, and doeth not onely not get, but loseth that is already gotten. For noblenesse of birth (is as it were) a clere lampe that sheweth forth and bringeth into light, workes bothe good and badde, and enflameth and prouoketh vnto vertue, as wel with the feare of slaunder, as also with the hope of praise. And wheras this brightnesse of noblenesse dothe not discouer the workes of the vnnoble, they haue a wante of prouocation and of feare of slaunder, and they recken not themselues bounde to wade anye further then their auncetours did before theym, whereas the noble of birthe counte it a shame not to arriue at the leaste at the boundes of their predecessours set foorth vnto thē. Therefore it chaunceth alwaies (in a maner) bothe in armes and in all other vertuous actes, that the moste famous menne are gentlemen. Because nature in euery thing hath depely sowed that priuie sede, which geueth a certain force and propertie of her beginning,Gentlemen of most prowesse vnto whatsoeuer springeth of it, and maketh it lyke vnto her selfe. As we see by exaumple not onely in the race of horses and other beastes, but also in trees, whose slippes and graftes alwayes for the moste parte are lyke vnto the stocke of the tree they came from: and yf at any time they growe out of kind, the fault is in the husbandman. And the lyke is in men, yf they bee trayned vp in good nourtour,Good bringīg vp in youthe. moste commonlye they resē

Truth it is, whether it be through the fauour of the starres or of nature,Some borne full of graces & comelines. some there are borne endowed wyth suche graces, that they seeme not to haue bene borne, but rather facioned with the verye hande of some God, and

                  eds that a man wyl not beleue, but nature hath brought them into the worlde for a spite and mockerie. And lyke as these with continual diligence and good bringyng vp for the most parte can bring small fruite: euen so the other with litle attendance clime to the full perfeccion of all excellency. Marke me the Lorde Hyppolitus da Este Cardinall of Ferrara, he hath hadde so happye a birthe, that his person, his countenaunce, his woordes, & all his gestures are so facioned & compact with this grace,Hypolitus da Este brother to the Duke of Ferrarra. that among the moste aunciente prelates (for all he is but yonge) he dothe represente so graue an aucthoritie, that a man woulde weene he were more meete to teache, then nedefull to learne. Likewise in company with menne and women of all degrees, in sportynge, in laughynge, and in iestynge he hath in hym a certayne sweetenesse, & so comely demeanours, that whoso speaketh with hym or yet beholdeth hym, muste nedes beare him an affeccion for euer. But returnyng to our purpose I saye, that betwene thys excellent grace, and that fonde foolyshnesse there is yet a meane, and they that are not by nature so perfectly furnished, with studye and diligence maye polishe and correct a great part of the defaultes of nature. The Courtyer therfore, besyde noblenesse of birthe, I wyll haue hym to be fortunate in this behalfe, & by nature to haue not only a wytte, and a comely shape of persone and countenance, but also a certain grace, and (as they saie) a hewe, that shal make him at the first sight acceptable & louyng vnto who so beholdeth him. And let this be an ornament to frame & accompanye all his actes, and to assure men in his looke, suche a one to bee woorthy the companye and fauour of euery great man.

And if I wiste that anye of you thought it a straunge or a newe matter, I woulde alledge vnto you sondrye, who for all they were borne of moste noble bloude, yet haue they bene heaped full of vyces: And contrarywise, many vnnoble that haue made famous their posteritie. And yf it be true that you sayde before, that the priuie force of the firste seede is in euerye thynge, we shoulde al bee in one maner condicion, for that we had all one selfe begynnynge, and one shoulde not bee more noble then an other. But besyde the diuersityes and degrees in vs of highe and lowe, I beleue there bee manye other matters, wherein I iudge fortune to be the chief, because we see her beare a stroke in al worldlye thinges, and (as it were) take a pastime to exalt many times whō pleaseth her without any desert at all, & burie in the botomles depth the most worthy to be exalted. I confirme your saying as touching the happines of thē that are borne abounding in all goodnes both of minde & bodie: but this is seen aswel in the vnnoble, as in the noble of birthe, for nature hath not these so subtile distinctions: yea (as I haue sayde) we se many times in persōs of most base degree, most high giftes of nature.

Thē aunswered Count Lewis: I denie not, but in mē of base degree may reigne the very same vertues yt are in gentlemē. But to auoyd rehersal of that we haue already said, with many other reasons that might be alleged in commendacion of noblenesse, the which is euermore honored of al mē because it stādeth with reasō yt good should spring of good, forsomuch as our entē

is to facion a Courtyer without ani maner default or lack in hym, & heaped with all praise, me thinke it a necessarye matter to make him a gentleman, as well for many other respects, as also for the common opinion, which by and by doeth leane to noblenesse. For where there are two in a noble mans house which at the first haue geuen no proofe of themselues with woorkes good or bad,Noblenes of birthe in estimacion with all men. assoone as it is knowen that the one is a gentleman borne, and the other not, the vnnoble shall be muche lesse estemed with euerye manne, then the gentleman,The imprintinges or conceiuinges of ye minde with expectacion. and he muste with much trauaile and long time imprint in mennes heades a good opnion of himselfe, whiche the other shal geat in a moment, and onely for that he is a gentleman: and howe waightye these imprintinges are euery man may easily iudge. For, to speake of our selues: we haue seen menne come to thys house, whiche for all they were fooles and dulwitted, yet had they a report through all Italye of great Courtyers, & though at length they were discouered and knowen, yet manye daies did thei beguyle vs, and mainteyned in oure myndes that oppinion of themselues, whiche at the fyrste they found there imprinted, although they wrought accordyng to their small skil. We haue seen other at the fyrste in very smal estimation,The yl inclynacion of princes in

                  uouring thē that deserue it not and afterwarde in the ende haue acquited themselues marueilous well. And of these errors there are diuers causes and among other the obstinatenes of princes, whiche to proue mastries oftentimes bend thē
               selues to fauor him, that to their seeming, deserueth no fauour at all, & manye tymes in deede they are deceyued. But because thei haue alwaies many yt counterfait thē, a very great report depēdeth vpō their fauor, yt which moste cōmōly iudgemēts folow. And if thei fīd any thīg yt semeth cōtrary to ye common opiniō, thei ar in doubt for deceiuing thēselues,We be moued to passions without anye manifest cause why. & alwaies loke for some matter secretly because it semeth, yt these general opiniōs ought to be foūded vpō a trothe, & arise of reasonable causes. And forsomuch as our mindes are very apte to loue and to hate: as in the sightes




of combates and games and in all other kinde of contencion one with an other, it is seene that the lookers on many times beare affecciō without any manifest cause why, vnto one of the two parties, with a gredy desire to haue him get the victorie, and the other to haue the ouerthrow. Also as touching the opinion of mens qualities, the good or yll reporte at the first brunt moueth oure mynde to one of these two passions: therefore it commeth to passe, that for the moste part we iudge with loue or els with hatred. You see then of what importance this first imprinting is, and howe he ought to endeuoure himself to get it good in princes, if he entende to be set by, and to purchase him the name of a good Courtyer. But to come to some particularitie, I iudge the principall and true profession of a Courtyer ought to be in feates of armes,Armes the Courtyers chiefe profession. the which aboue all I will haue hym to practise liuely, and to bee knowen among other for his hardinesse, for his acheuing of enterprises, and for his fidelitie toward him whom he serueth. And he shall purchase himselfe a name with these good cō
               dicions, in doing the dedes in euerie time and place: for it is not for him to feint at any time in this behalfe without a wonderous reproche.That he take no foile. And euen as in women honestye once stained dothe neuer retourne againe to the former astate: So the fame of a gentleman that carieth weapon, yf it once take a foile in any litle point through dastardlines or any other reproche, doeth euermore continue shameful in the worlde and full of ignoraunce. Therefore the more excellent our Courtyer shalbe in this arte, the more shall he bee worthy praise: albeit I iudge not necessarye in hym so perfect a knowledge of thynges and other qualities yt is requisite in a capitaine. But because this is ouerlarge a scope of matters, wee wyll holde oure selues contented (as wee haue sayde) with the vprightnesse of a well meaning minde, & with an inuincible courage, and that he alwaies shew himself such a one: for many times mē of courage are sooner knowen in small matters then in greate.




Often times in daungers that stande them vpon,Cowardes sometime hardie. & where many eyes be, ye shall see some that for all their hearte is dead in their bodie, yet pricked with shame or with the cō
               pany, go forwarde (as it were) blindfield and do their duetie. And god knoweth bothe in matters that little touche them, and also where they suppose that without missynge they may conuey themselues from daunger, how they are willingynough to slepe in a whole skinne.Who haue ye stoutenesse of courage. But suche as think themselues neither marked, seen, nor knowen, and yet declare a stout courage, and suffer not the leaste thyng in the worlde to passe that maie burthen them, they haue ye courage of spirite whiche we seke to haue in our Courtyer. Yet will we not haue him for al that so lustie to make brauerie in woordes, and to bragge that he hathe wedded his harneys for his wife, and to threaten with suche grim lookes, as we haue seene Berto do oftentimes. For vnto suche maie well be saide that a worthie Gentlewoman in a noble assembly spake pleasauntly vnto one, that shall be namelesse for this tyme, whome she to shewe hym a good countenance, desired to daunce with her, and he refusing both that, and to heare musick and many other entertainmentes offred him, alwaies affirmyng suche trifles not to be his profession, at last the Gentlewoman demaundyng him, what is then your profession? He aunswered with a frowning looke, to fight. Then saide the Gentlewoman: seing you are not nowe at the warre nor in place to fight, I woulde thinke it beste for you to bee well besmered and set vp in an armorie with other implementes of warre till time wer that you should be occupied, least you wa

purchaseth himself the hatred and yll will of the hearers. And I, aunswered the L. Gaspar, haue knowen few men excellent in any thing whatsoeuer it bee, but they praise thē selues. And me thinke it may wel be borne in them: for he that is of skill, whan he seeth that he is not knowē for his woorkes of the ignoraunte, hath a disdeigne that his connynge should lye buried,Estimation the reward of vertious actes. and needes muste he open it one waie, least he should bee defrauded of the estimation that belongeth to it, whiche is the true rewarde of vertuous trauailes. Therefore among the auncient writers he that muche excelleth doeth sildome forbeare praisyng hymself. They in deede are not to be borne withall that hauyng no skill in theym, wyll prayse themselues: but we wyll not take our Courtyer to be suche a one. Then the Count, yf you haue well vnderstoode (quoth he) I blamed the praysynge of a mans selfe impudently and withoute respecte. And surelye (as you saye) a man ought not to conceyue an yll oppinion of a skilfull man that praiseth hymselfe, dyscretely, but rather take it for a more certaine witnes, then yf it came out of an other mans mouth. I agree well that he, whiche in praising himselfe falleth not into errour, nor purchaseth himself lothsomenes or hatred of the hearers, is moste discrete: and beside the praises whiche he geueth himselfe, deserueth the same of other men also, because it is a very harde matter. Then the L. Gaspar, this (quoth he) muste you teache vs. The Count aunswered: Emong the auntient writers there hathe not also wanted that hathe taught it.In what sort a man maye praise himself But in mine opiniō, all doth consist in speaking such thynges after a sort, yt it maye appeare that they are not rehearsed to that ende: but that they come so to purpose, that he can not refrayne tellyng them, and alwaies seemynge to flee his owne prayse tell the trueth. But not as those lustie laddes dooe, that open their mouthe and thruste oute woordes at auenture they care not how. As within these few dayes one of oure cōpany beyng pusshed throughe the thygh with a pyke at Pysa,

it was the bytynge of a flie. And an other sayde that he occupied no lookynge glasse in his chamber, because in hys rage he was so terrible to beholde, that in lookynge vpon his owne countenaunce he shoulde put himself into much feare. At this euery one laughed. But the L. Cesar Gonzaga saide vnto them: At what laugh you? Knowe ye not that the great Alexander,Anaxagoras. hearing a certayne Philosophers oppinion to be that there were infinite worldes, fell in weping: And when he was asked the question why he wept, he aunswered: Because I haue not yet one in hande, as thoughe his mynde was to haue them all. Dooe you not thynke that this was a greater brauerie, then to speak of the fly biting: So was Alexander a greater person then he that so sayde, aunswered the Count. But excellent mē in very deede are to be helde excused, whan they take muche vpon them: because he that vndertaketh great enterprises muste haue a boldnesse to dooe it, and a confidence of hym selfe, and not of a bashfull or cowardly mynde, but yet sober in woordes: shewing as though he tooke lesse vpō hym then he dothe in deede, so that his taking vpon him do not extend vnto rashnesse. Here the Count respetyng a while M. Bernard Bibiena saide merelye: I remember you saide before, that this oure Courtyer oughte of nature to haue a faire comelynesse of fisnamye and person, with the grace that oughte to make hym so amyable. As for the grace and beautie of fisnamie, I thynke not the contrary but they are in me, and therefore doe so many women burne for the loue of me, as you knowe. But for the comelynesse of persone, I stande somewhat in doubte, and especiallye by reason of my legges here, for me thinke in deede thei are not so wel made as I could wishe thei wer: the body and the rest is meetely wel. Therfore declare som what more particularly this comelines of person, what it should be, that I may be out of this doubt & set my heart at reste. Whan thei had a while ughed at this, the Count sayde: Certes, ye grace of ye fisnamy, may wel be said to be in you




without any lye. And no other exaumple doe I alledge but this, to declare what maner thing it shoulde bee: for vndoubtedly we see your countenaunce is most acceptable & pleasant to beholde vnto euery man, although the proporciō and draughtes of it be not very delicate, but it is manly and hath a good grace withall. And this qualitie haue many and sundrye shapes of visages.The countenaunce of the Courtyer. And suche a countenaunce as this is, will I haue our Courtyer to haue, and not so softe and womanishe as manye procure to haue, ye do not onely courle the hear, and picke the browes, but also paumpre themselues in euery point like the most wanton and dishonest women in the worlde: and a man would thinke thē in goyng,Menne that woulde appere womē. in standing, and in all their gestures so tender and feint, that their members were ready to flee one from an other, and their woordes they pronounce so drawningly, that a man would weene they were at that instant yelding vp the ghost: and the higher in degree the men are they talke withall, the more they vse suche facyons. These men, seing nature (as they seeme to haue a desire to appeare and to bee) hath not made them women, ought not to be esteamed in place of good women, but like common Harlottes to be banished, not onely out of prynces courtes, but also oute of the companye of Gentlemen. To come therefore to the qualitie of the person, I say he is wel,Good to bee of a meane stature. if he bee neither of y• least, nor of the greatest sise. For bothe the one and the other hath with it a certayne spytefull wonder, and suche men are marueyled at, almoste, as muche as men marueile to behoulde monstrous thynges. Yet if there must nedes be a defaulte in one of the two extremities, it shall be lesse hurtfull to bee somewhat of the least,Rather with the lowest then to high. then to excede the common stature in height. For mē so shut vp of bodie, beside that manye tymes they are of a dull wit, they are also vnapte for all exercyses of nimeblenesse, whiche I much desire to haue in the Courtyer. And therefore will I haue him to bee of a good shape, and well proporcioned in his lymmes, and to shewe strength, lightnes,




and quickenesse,To be a man of warre. and to haue vnderstandyng in all exercises of the bodie, that belonge to a man of warre. And herein I thinke the chief point is to handle well all kynde of weapon both for footeman and horseman,To handle al kind of weapon. and to know the vaun

               ages in it. And especially to be skilfull on those weapons that are vsed ordinarily emong gentlemen, for beside the vse that he shall haue of them in warre, where peraduenture nedeth no great connyng, there happen often times variaunces betwene one gentleman and an other, whereupon ensueth a combat. And manye tymes it shall stande him in stede to vse the weapon whiche he hath at that instant by his side, therefore it is a very sure thing to be skilfull. And I am none of them whiche saye,Fightinge maketh not a mā to forget his fence. that he forgetteth his conning whan he commeth to the poynte: for to abide by, whoso loseth his conning at that time, sheweth that he hath firste loste his heart and his spirites for feare. I think also it will serue his turne greatly, to know ye feate of wrastling,Wrastlynge. because it goeth much together with all weapon on foote. Againe it is behouffull bothe for him selfe and for his frendes,To knowe what is to be done in quarrels whan they happen. that he haue a foresight in the quarelles and controuersies that may happē, and let him beware of the vauntages, declarynge alwaies in euerye pointe bothe courage and wisedome. Neither let him rūne rashely to these combattes, but whan he muste needes to saue his estimation withall:Not rashe to fight combattes. for beside the greate daunger that is in the doubtfull lotte, hee that goeth headlonge to these thynges and without vrgent cause, deserueth verye great blame, although his chaunce bee good. But whan a man perceiueth that he is entred so farre that hee can not drawe backe withoute burdeyn, hee muste,Howe a man ought to behaue himself in fightyng a combatte. bothe in suche thinges he hath to doe before the combat and also in the combat be vtterlye resolued with hymselfe, and alwayes shewe a readinesse and a stomake. And not as some dooe, passe the matter in arguing and pointes, and hauing the choise of weapon, take suche as haue neyther poynte nor edge. And arme themselues as thoughe they shoulde goe




against the shotte of a Cannon. And weening it sufficyēt not to be vanquished, stande alwaies at their defence and geue grounde, in so muche that they declare an extreme faint hert, and are a mocking stocke to the verye chyldren. As those two of Ancona: that a while a goe fought a combat beside Perugia, and made them to laughe that looked on. And what were they, quoth the L. Gaspar Palla

Also men occupie their weapon oftentimes in tyme of peace aboute sondrie exercises, and gentlemen are seen in open showes in the presence of people, women and Princes. Therefore will I haue our Courtyer a perfecte horseman for euerye saddle.A perfecte horseman. And beside the skyll in horses and in whatsoeuer belongeth to a horseman, let him set all his delite and dylygence to wade in euerye thyng a litle farther then other menne, so that he maye bee knowen among al menne for one that is excellente.Alcibiades excelled other nations in theyr owne

And it is founde that it hath also bene muche vsed amonge them of olde tyme. It is meete for hym also to haue the arte of swimming, to leape, to runne,Swimming Leapyng. Runnyng.

Also it is a noble exercyse and meete for one lyuyng in court to play at tenyse, where the disposition of the bodye,Playe at tenyse. the quickenesse and nimeblenesse of euerye member is much perceyued, and almoste whatsoeuer a manne can see in all other exercises. And I recken vautyng of no lesse prayse, which for all it is peynefull and harde,Uawting. maketh a man more light and quicker then any of the rest: and beside the profite, yf that lightnesse be accompanyed with a good grace, it maketh (in my iudgemente) a better showe then anye of the reste.

And not do, as a frende of ours, whom you al know, that thought he resembled much kyng Ferdinande the yonger of Aragon, and regarded not to resemble hym in anye other poynt but in the often lyftyng vp hys head, wrying therewythall a part of hys mouth, the whych custome the king had gotten by infyrmitye.

How much more do we take pleaser in a gentilman that is a man at armes, and how much more worthy praise is he if he be modest, of few wordes, and no bragger, then an other that alwayes craketh of him self, & blaspheming with a brauery s

But he that shoulde write, I would thinke he committed an errour in not vsing them: bicause they gaue a great grace and aucthoritie vnto writinges, and of them is compact a tonge more graue and more full of maiestie, then of the newe.

               red he would flee the vsing of those auntient Tuscane wordes. And in vsyng them, beside that he should be a laughing stock, he should bringe no small lothesomenesse to hym that heard them. Therfore me thinke it a straunge matter to vse those wordes for good in writing, that are to be eschewed for naughtie in euerie maner of speache: and to haue that whiche is neuer proper in speache,What 
                     〈…〉

And therfore in speache, whiche as soone as the sonne is pronounced vanisheth a way, peraduenture somthinges are more to be borne withall, then in writinge. Because writinge keepeth the woordes in store, and referreth them to the iudgemente of the reader, and geueth tyme to examyne




them depely. And therefore reason willeth that greater diligence should be had therein to make it more trimme and better corrected: yet not so, that the written wordes should be vnlike the spoken, but in writing to chuse oute the fayrest and proprest of significacion that be vsed in s
                  •
               eaking. And if that should be lawful in writing, which is not lawfull in speaking, there should arise an inconuenience of it (in my iudgement) very great: namely, that a man myght vse a greater libertie in the thinge, where he ought to vse most diligence, and the labour he bestoweth in writing, in stede of furtherance should hinder him.What is alowed in w yting, is allowed in speaking. Therfore it is certain, whatsoeuer is allowed in writing, is also allowed in speaking: and that speache is moste beautifull that is like vnto beautifull writinges. And I iudge it much more behoufful to be vnderstoode in writing then in speaking, because they that write are not alwaies presente with them that rede, as they that speake with thē that speake.Why writīg oughte to bee more vnderstood, then speaking. Therfore would I commende him, that beside the eschewing of many auncient Tuskane woordes, would applye himself also to vse bothe in writing and speakyng, suche as now a daies are in vse in Tuscane and in other partes of Italy, and that haue some grace in the pronunciation. And (in my minde) whoso foloweth any other trade is not assured not to runne into that curiositie so muche blamed, whiche we haue spoken of before. Thē spake Sir Frederick: I cannot denye you, Count Lewi
                     •
                  , that writinge is not a maner of speaking. But this I saie, if the wordes that are spoken haue any darkenesse in them, that communicacion perceth not the minde of him that heareth: and passing without being vnderstoode, wexeth vaine and to no purpose: the whiche dothe not happen in writyng, for if the woordes that the writer vseth bring with them a litle (I will not saie diffycultie) but couered subtilty, and not so open, as suche as be ordinarily spoken, they geue a certain greater aucthoritye to writing, and make the reader more hedefull to pause at it, and to ponder it better, and he taketh a delyte in the




wittinesse and learning of him that writeth, and with a good iudgement, after some paines takyng, he tasteth the pleaser that consisteth in harde thinges. And if the ygnoraunce of him that readeth bee suche, that he cannot compasse that difficultie, there is no blame in the writer, neither ought a man for all yt to thinke that tunge not to bee faire. Therefore in writing, I houlde opinion it is necessarie for a man to vse the Tuscane wordes, and only such as haue bene vsed among the auncient Tuskans: for it is a great testimoniall and approued by tyme, that they bee good and of pithie signification in that thei be applyed to. And beside this they haue t

               tinges, and to euerye thyng that is of force to preserue it. And many times with this onely brightnes and dignitie they make the fourme of sentences very fair, and through the vertue and eleganciethereof, euery matter howe base so euer it be, maie be so decked oute, that it maie deserue verye great commendacion. But this youre custome, that you make so muche a doe of, appeareth vnto me very daungerous, and many times it maie be naught. And if anye vice of speache be taken vp of many ignorant persones, me thinke for all that it oughte not to be receyued for a rule, nor folowed of other. Besides this, customs be manye and diuers,So manye Cities so many diuerse maner of speaches in Italy. and ye haue not a notable Citye in Italy that hath not a diuers maner of speache from all the rest. Therefore if ye take not the paines to declare whiche is the best, a manne maye as well geue hym selfe to the Bergamask tunge, as to the Florentine, and to folowe youre aduyse it were no erroure at all.The bargamask tunge ye moste barbarous in Italy.

The L.

And albeit the Athenian tongue was more fine, purer, & eloquenter then the rest, yet did not the good writers that were not of Athens borne, so affect it, but in the stile of writing, and (as it were) in the smack and propretie of their naturall speache they were welinough knowen: neither were they anye whit the lesse regarded for all that, but rather such as would appeere ouer mere Athenians wer blamed for it. Amonge the Latin writers in like case manye there were in their dayes much set bye that were no Romanes althoughe there appeared not in them that propre and peculiar purenesse of the Romane tongue, whiche menne of an other nation can verie seldome attaine. In times past T. Liuius was not neglected,T. Liuius. Uirgill. althoughe some one sayde he founde in him mere Padowan: Nor Virgil, for that he was reprehended that he spake not Romane.

Consider with your selues that we haue no more any knoweleage of the Osca tunge. The prouinciall tung, that (a man may say) the last day was renowmed of noble writers, now is it not vnderstoode of the inhabitantes of the countrey. I beleaue therefore (as the L. Iulian hath said) that wer Petrarca, and Boccaccio, at this present in lief, they would not vse many woordes that we see in their writinges. Therfore (in mine opiniō) it is not well done to folow them therin. Yet do I muche commende them that can folowe that ought to be folowed: but notwithstanding I beleue it be possible ynough to write well without folowyng, and especiallye in this our tunge, wherin we may be helped by custome, the which I wyll not take vpon me in the Latin. Then Sir Friderick, why, wil you (quoth he) custom should be more appriced in the vulgar tunge, then in the Latin? Nay, bothe in the one and the other (answered the Count) I iudge custome ought to be ye maistresse. But forsomuche as those menne, vnto whom the Latin tunge was as proper, as is the vulgar tunge nowe to vs, are no more in the world, we must learne of their writinges that they learned by vse and custome: neyther doeth auncyent speach signifye any thing els but an auncyent custome of speach:Aun

                  ient speach auntient custome of speache. & it wer a fond matter to loue the auncient speach for nothing elles but to speake rather as men did speake, then as menne doe speake. Did not they then of olde time folowe, aunswered Sir Fridericke? I beleaue,Olde writers did not imitate in all pointes. quoth the Counte, many did folowe, but not in euery point. An if




               Virgill had altogether folowed Hesiodus, he should not haue passed him nor Cicero Crassus, nor Ennius his predecessors. Behould Homer, who is so auntient that he is thought of many to be the first heroical Poet aswell of time, as also of excellencie of phrase: and whom wyll you haue him to haue folowed? Some other, aunswered Sir Friderick, more auntient then he was, whiche we heare not of, by reason of tomuch antiquitie. Whom will you say then Petrarca and Boccaccio folowed, said the Count, whiche (a man may say) were but thre dayes agoo in the world▪ I knowe not, answered Sir Fridericke, but it is to be thoughte they in lyke wise bent their minde to folowinge, thoughe wee knowe not of whom. The Count aunswered: a man maye beleaue that they that were folowed, were better then they that did folowe: and it were to great a wonder that their name and renowme (if they were good) should so soone be cleane lost. But I beleaue their verye maister was witt, and their owne naturall inclination and iudgement.A man may write well without imitation. And therat no man ought to wonder, for (in a maner) alwayes a manne by sundrye wayes may clime to the toppe of all perfection. And their is no matter, that hath not in it many thinges of like sorte vnlike the one to the other, which for al that among them selues deserue a like praise. Mark me musick,Musick. wherin are harmonies somtime of base soune and slowe, and otherwhile very quicke and of newe diuises, yet do they all recreat a man: but for sundrye causes, as a manne may perceiue in the maner of singinge that Bidon vseth,Sundry sortes of musike and all delite which is so artificiall, counninge, vehement, stirred, and suche sundrye melodies, that the spirites of ye hearers moue al and are enflamed, and so listening a man would wene they were lifte vp in to heauen. And no lesse doeth our Marchetto Cara moue in his singinge, but with a more softe harmonye, that by a delectable waye and full of mourninge sweetnesse maketh tender and perceth the mind, and sweetly imprinteth in it a passion full of great delite. Sundrye thinges in lyke maner do equally please




oure eyes somuche, that a man shall haue muche a do to iudge in whiche they most delite.Sūdry peincters perfit in sundrie kinde of trades. Behould in peincting Leonard Vncio, Mantegna, Raphael, Michelangelo, George of Castelfranco: they are all most excellent dooers, yet are they in working vnlike, but in any of them a man wold not iudge yt there wanted ought in his kind of trade: for euery one is knowen to be of most perfection after his maner. The like is of many Poets both Greeke and Latin, which being diuerse in writing are alike in praise.

So that whoso could consider all the Oratours that haue bene in the worlde,So manye oratours so many kindes of speach. he should finde so manye Oratours, so many kindes of speach.

But in this point (me think) we haue spoken tomuch. Therfore let vs now procead in our communication of the Courtier. Then answered Sir Friderick: but first I will saye this lytle, whiche is that I denye not but the opinions and wittes of men are diuers emong themselues: neither doe I iudge it comelye for one that is vehement and quicke of nature to take in hand to write of soft and quiet matters. Nor yet for an other that is seuere and graue to write of mery conceits. For in this point (me think) it is reason euery man should apply him self to his own proper inclinatiō, & of this I beleue spake Cicero, when he said that maisters should haue a consideration to the nature of their scholers, least they should doe like the yll husbandmanne, that sometime in a soyle that is good onely for vynes will sowe graine. But it wyll

And thus shall the difference whiche you saye is betwene the good Oratours, be found to consist in the senses and not in the tunge. Then the Count, I feare me (quoth he) we shall enter into a large sea, and leaue oure first purpose of the Courtyer. But I would knowe of you, wherin consisteth the goodnes of this tunge? Sir Fridericke, aunswered: In keping well the propertie of it: & in taking i

                in ye significacion (vsing ye same stile & measur) that al such haue done as haue written wel. I would know then, quoth ye Count, whether this stile and measure which you speake of,Wherin consisteth the goodnesse of the tung. arise of the sentences or of the wordes? Of the wordes, answered Sir Friderick. Do you not thinke then, quoth the Count, that ye wordes of Silius and Cornelius Tacitus, are ye very same that Virgil and Cicero vse? and taken in the same signification? Sir Fridericke aunswered: they are the very same in dede, but some yll applyed and dyuerslye taken. The Count aunswered: in case a manne shoulde pyke out of a booke of Cornelius and of Silius, al the woordes placed in other signification then is in Virgil and Cicero, (whiche shoulde bee verye fewe) woulde you not then saye that Cornelius in the tounge were equall with Cicero, and Silius with Virgil? Then the L. Emilia, me thinke (quoth shee) thys youre dysputation hathe lasted to longe, and hathe been verye tedyouse, therefore it shall bee best




to deferre it vntill an other tyme. Sir Fridericke, began still to make aunswere,Many talkers of imitat

                but the L. Emilia alwayes interrupted hym. At laste the Count saide: manye will iudge of styles and talke of numbers and measures, & of folowing, but they cannot doe me to vnderstande what maner a thinge stile and measure is, and wherin folowing consisteth: Nor why, thinges taken out of Homer or any other, are so well couched in Virgil, that they appeare rather amplyfied then folowed, and peraduenture the occation thereof is that I am not able to conceiue it. But because a great argument that a man vnderstandeth a thinge, is the vnderstanding that 
                  •
               e hath to teach it, I feare me they themselues haue small vnderstanding in it, and praise Virgil and Cicero, because they heare them praised of many, not for that they knowe the difference betwene them and others, whiche out of peraduenture consisteth not in the obseruation of two, or three, or of tenne woordes vsed after a diuers maner from other. In Salust, in Cesar, in Varro, & in other good writers, there are founde some termes applyed otherwise then Cicero applyeth them, and both the one and the other doeth welinough. Bicause in so triflynge a matter the goodnesse and perfection of a tunge doeth not consiste as Demosthenes answered Eschines well that had taken him vp, demaundinge him of certaine woordes whiche he hadde vsed and yet were not auntient,Demosthenes aunswer to Eschines. what monsters or wonderous matters they were? Wherat Demosthenes laughed, & answered him, that the fortunes of Grece depended not vpon them. Euen so would I passe full litle if a Tuscane should reprehende me for speaking rather Satisfatto, then Sodisfatto: and Honoreuole,
               Diuersitie of certain Tuscane wordes with the rest of Italy 
               then Horreuole: and Causa, then Cagione & Populo, then Popolo, & such other matters. Then arose Sir Friderick vpon his feete and saide: I besech ye giue the hearing of these few woordes. The L. Emilia answered laughing: vppon my displeasure I forbid anye of you to talke any more in this matter, for I will haue you to breake it of vntill an other night. But you Count, proceade you in




your communication of the Courtyer, and let vs see how good a memory you haue: for I beleue, if ye can knitt it agayne where you brake of, ye shall not do a litle. Madam, answered the Count, me think the thrid is broken in sunder, but if I be not deceyued, I trowe we saide that pestylent curiositie doth alwayes geue an il grace vnto al thinges: and contrarywise simplicity and Reckelesness a maruailous good grace. In commendation wherof and in dispraise of curiosity, many other thinges might be said, yet wil I alleage but one mo, and then haue done. All women generally haue a great desire to be,Women that peincte them selues to seme faire to men. and when they canne not be, at the least to appear beawtyfull. Therfore where nature in some part hath not done her deuoyr therin, they endeuour them selues to supply it with art. Of this ariseth the trymming of the face, with such studye and many times peines, the pilling of the browes and forehead, and the vsynge of all those maner wayes, and the abydyng of such lothsomenesse, as you women beleaue are kept
                  •
                very secret from men, and yet do all men know them. The La. Constance Fregosa laughed at this, and said: you shoulde do much better to go forward in your cōmunication, and declare how a man may attein a good grace, & speak of courtynge, then to discouer the faultes of women wythout purpose. Nay it is much to purpose, answered the Count, bicause these defaultes that I talke of take this grace from you: for they proceade of nothing els but of curiousnesse, wherby ye discouer openlye vnto euerye man the ouer great desire that ye haue to be beawtiful. Do you not marke howe much more grace is in a woman, that if she doth trim her self, doeth it so scacely & so litle, that whoso behouldeth her, standeth in doubt whether she be trimmed or no: then in an other so bedawbed, that a man woulde wene she had a viser on her face and dareth not laugh for making it chappe: nor at any tyme chaungeth her colour, but whan she apparayleth her self in the morninge, and all the rest of the daye standeth lyke an image of woodde

Whyte teeth is a good sight in a woman, for sence they are not in so open sight as is the face, but most communly are hid, a man may think she bestoweth not so much laboure about them, to make them white, as she doeth in the face: yet who so shoulde laughe without cause purposly to show them, should discouer the art, & for all their faire whitenesse should appeare vnto all men to haue a very yll grace,Faire hādes. as Egnatius in Catullius. The like is in the handes, which being delicate, smooth & faire, yf they be shewed bare at a tyme whan occasyon is to occupye them, and not of purpose to showe the beawtye of them, they leaue a verye great desire of themselues, and especiallye after they are couered wyth gloues agayne, for a manne would iudge that in puttynge them on againe she passeth not and lytle regardeth whether they be in sighte or no,Clenlye and precise in places sildome seene. and that they are so fayre rather by nature, then by anye studye or dilygence. Haue ye not hadde an eye otherwhyle, whan eyther in the stretes goynge to Churche, or in anye other place, or in sportyng, or by any other chaunce it happeneth that a woman lyfteth vp her clothes so high, that she sheweth her foote, and sometime a litle of her pretye legge vnwittinglye? And seemeth shee not to you to haue a verye good grace, yf ye beholde her then with a certayne womanlye dysposition,




cleanlye and precise, with her shooes of vellute, and her hose sittynge cleane to her legge? Truely it deliteth me much, and I beleue all of you, for euerye manne supposeth that Preciseness in so secret a place and so sildom seen, to be vnto that woman rather natural & propre then forced, and that thereby she thinketh to gett her no commendation at all. In such sort is curiousenesse auoyded and couered, the which you maye nowe conceyue howe contrarye it is, and taketh awaye the grace of euerye operation and deede, aswell of the bodye as of the minde,The minde. whereof hitherto we haue spoken but litle, and yet ought it not to be omitted, for as the minde is muche more worthye then the bodye, so deserueth it also to bee better decked and polished. And howe that ought to be in oure Courtyer (leauynge a parte the preceptes of so manye wyse Phylosophers that wryte in this matter and define the vertues of the minde, and so subtillye dyspute of the dignitye of them) wee will expresse in fewe wordes, applyinge to our pourpose, that it is sufficient he be (as they terme it commonlye) an honest manne and welmeaning: for in this is comprehended the goodnesse, the wisdome, the manlynesse and the temperaunce of the mynde, and all other qualityes that belonge to so worthye a name.To applye a mans good will is profeting. And I recken hym onelye a true morall Phylosopher that wyll be good, and to that, he needeth fewe other preceptes then that will of his. And therefore saide Socrates well, that he thought his instructions hadde broughte foorth good fruite whan by them he hadde prouoked anye one to applye hys wyll to the knoweleage and learnynge of vertue. For they that are come to the pointe that they couette nothynge more then to be good, do easyly attayne the vnderstandynge of all that beelongeth thereto: therefore herein we wyll make no more a do. But besyde goodnesse, the true and principall ornament of the mynde in euerye manne (I beeleaue) are letters,




although the Frenchmen know onelye the noblenesse of armes,The French menne make none accōpte of learning. & passe for nothing beside: so that they do not onelye not sett by letters, but they rather abhorre them, and all learned men they count verie rascalles, and they think it a great vilany whan any one of them is called a clarke. Then aunswered the L. Iulian, you say very true, this errour in deede hath longe reigned among the frenchemen. But if Monseigneur de Angoulism haue so good luck that he may (as men hope) succede in the Croun,Francis .i. French king ye glory of armes in Fraunce doeth not so florishe nor is had in suche estimatiō, as letters wilbe, I beleaue. For it is not long sins I was in Fraunce, & saw this Prince in the Court there, who semed vnto me beside the handsomenesse of personne and beawty of visage, to haue in his countenance so great a maiestie, accompanyed neuerthelesse with a certayne louelye courteisy, that the realme of Fraunce should euer seeme vnto him a small matter. I vnderstoode afterward by many gentilmen both French and Italian, very much of the most noble condicions, of the greatnesse of courage, prowesse and liberalitie that was in him: and emonge other thinges, it was tolde me that he highly loued & esteamed letters, and had in verie great reputation all learned men, and blamed the Frenchemen themselues that their mindes were so farr wide from this profession,Uniuersitye of Paris. especially hauing at their doores so noble an vniuersitye as Paris is, where all the world resorteth. Then spake the Count: It is great wonder that in these tender yeres only by the prouocation of nature, contrary to the maner of the countrey he hath geuen himself to so good a way. And because subiectes folow alwaies the cōdicions of the higher powers, it is possible that it may come to passe (as you say) that the Frenchmen will yet esteeme letters to be of that dignity that they are in deed. The which (if they wil geue ear ther to) they may soone be perswaded, forsomuch as men ought to couet of nature nothing so much and that is more proper for them,Knowleage. then knowleage: which thing it wer a great




folly to say or to holde opinion that it is not alwaies good. And in case I might commune with them, or with other that were of a contrarie opinion to me, I would do my diligence to show them, how much letters (which vndoubtedlye haue bene graunted of God vnto men for a soueraigne gift) are profytable and necessarye for our lief and estimation. Neyther should I want thexamples of so many excellent capitaines of old time, which all ioyned the Ornament of letters, with the prowesse of armes.Howe the great Alexander esteamed Homer, Plutarck, in the life of Alexander. For (as you know) Alexander had Homer in such reuerence, that he laide his Ilias alwayes vnder his beddes head: and he applied diligentlye not these studies onely, but also the speculations of Philosophye vnder the discipline of Aristotle. Alcibiades encreased his good condicions and made them greater with letters, and with the instructions of Socrates.

And if I be not deceiued (I trowe) I haue read in my time that he left a booke behind him of his owne makynge in the Greeke tunge. But this kynd of talke is more then nedeth, for I knowe all you vnderstand howe much the Frenchemen be deceiued in houlding opinion letters to do anye hurt to armes.G

And therfore manye tymes, lyke the voices of Meremaydens, they are the cause of drownyng him that doeth not well stoppe his eares at such deceitfull harmonie. This daunger being perceiued, there hath bene among the auncient wise men that hath written bookes,Men take no hede to flatterers. howe a manne should know a true friend from a flatterer. But what aauaileth it? If there be many of them (or rather infinit) that manifestly perceiue there are flatterers, and yet loue hym that flattereth them, & hate him that telleth them the trothe, and often times (standinge in opinion that he that praiseth them is to scace in his woordes) they themselues helpe him forward, and vtter such matters of themselues, that the most impudent flatterer of all is ashamed of.

In this wise for the reasons we haue said he shal auoyde curyousnesse, and the meane thinges which he taketh in hand, shal appeare very great. Here M.

And if Alexander enuied Achilles bicause he was praised of him that did it, yet doth it not consequently folowe that he esteamed letters more then armes. Wherin if he had knowen himself so farr wide from Achilles, as in writing he thought al they would be from Homer yt should go about to write of him, I am sure he would muche sooner haue desired wel doing in himself then wel speaking in an other. Therfore think I that this was a close praise of himself, and a wishing for that he thought he had not, namelye the high excellency of a writer, and not for that he thought with himself he had already obtayned, that is to say, the prowess of armes, wherin he counted not Achilles any whit his superiour,What Alexander ment by calling Achilles happy wherefore he called him happye, as it were signifiyng, where his fame in foretime was not so renowmed in the worlde, as was the fame that by so diuyne a Poeme was cleere and excellent, it proceaded not for that his prowes and desertes were not such & worthy so much praise: but it arose of fortune that had before hād prepared for Achilles that miracle of nature for a glorious renowme & trompet of his actes.

This can not now the grauer in marble do, ne yet express the grace of the sight that is in the black eyes or in azurre with the shininge of those amorous beames. He can not show the coulour of yelow hear, nor ye glistring of armour, nor a darke nyght, nor a Sea tempest, nor those twincklinges and sperkeles, nor the burninge of a Citye, nor the rising of the mornyng in the coulour of roses with those beames of purple and gold. Finallye he can not show the skye, the sea, the earth, hilles, woddes, medowes, gardeines, riuers, Cityes, nor houses, which the peincter doeth all. For this respect (me thinke) peincting is more noble, & conteyneth in it a greater workeman shippe then grauing in marble.

Therfore sticke not (Count) to pay this debt, being alreadye discharged of one part therof. I should not haue so greate a debt to discharg, answered the Count, if the peynes were equallye deuided, but the faulte hath bene, in geuinge a Ladye authoritye to commaunde, that is to partial: and so smiling he beheld the Lady Emilia, which said immediatly: you ought not to complain of my partiality, yet sins ye do it against reasō, we wil giue one part of this honor, which you call peynes, vnto an other: & tourninge her vnto Sir

            ¶ THE SECOND BOOKE OF the Courtier of Count Baldessar Castilio vnto. M. Alphonsus Ariosto.
            
               NOt without marueile many a time and often haue I considered wyth my self howe one errour should arise, the which bicause it is generallye seene in olde men, a man may beleaue it is proper and naturall vnto them: and that is,In erro

And in good sooth it seemeth a matter very wide from reason & worthye to be noted, that rype age whiche with long practise is wont to make mennes iudgementes more perfecte in other thynges, should in this behalf so corrupt them, that they should not discerne, yf the worlde wexed worse and worse, & the fathers were generally better then the children, we should long ere this tyme haue ben come to that vtmost degree of yll that can not wexe worse. And yet doe we see not onely in our dayes, but also in tymes past that this hath alwaies ben the peculier vyce of that age. The which is to be manifestlye gathered by the writynges of manye most auntient aucthours, and especyally comedy writers, whiche expresse better then the rest, the trade of mannes lyfe. The cause therefore of this false opinion in old menne, I beleue (in mine opinion) is, for that, yeares wearing away, cary also with them many commodities,The cause of the errour. and emonge other take awaye from the bloud a greate part of the lyuely spirites that altereth the complection, & the instrumentes wexe feeble, wherby the soule worketh her effectes.

               her of the former pleasures receyueth it anye thynge elles but a fast memorye and the print of the beloued time of tender age,Tyme of youth. which whan we haue vpon vs, the heauen, the earth, and ech thing to our seeming reioiceth and laugheth alwayes about our eyes, and in thought (as in a sauoury and pleasaunt gardein) florisheth the sweete spring time of mirth, so that peraduēture it were not vnprofitable, when now in the colde season, the Son of our lief (taking away from vs oure delites) beginneth to draw towarde the Weste, to lose in like case therwithal the mindefulnesse of them, and to find out (as Themistocles sayth) an art to teach vs to forget: for the sences of oure bodye are so deceyuable, that they beguile many times also the iudgment of the mind.Senses of the body Therefore (me thinke) olde men be like vnto them, that saylinge in a vessell out of an hauen, behoulde the ground with their eyes, and the vessell to ther seeminge standeth styll and the shore goeth: and yet is it cleane contrary, for the hauen, and likewise the time and pleasures continue still in their astate, & we with the vessell of mortalitye flying away, go one after an other through the tempestuous sea that swaloweth vp & deuoureth al thinges, neither is it graunted vs at any time to come on shore again, but alwaies beaten with contrary windes, at the end we break our vessell at some rocke.The mind of olde age. Because therefore the minde of old age is without order subiect to many pleasures, it can not taste them: and euen as to them that be sycke of a feauer whan by corrupt vapours they haue lost theyr taste, all wines appeare mo

those they remember they haue proued in foretyme, althoughe the pleasures in themselues be the selfe same. Therfore when they feele themselues voide of them, it is a griefe, and they blame the time present for yll, not perceyuinge that this chaunge proceadeth of themselues and not of the tyme. And contrarywyse whan they call to minde the pleasures past, they remember therwithall the time they had them in, and therfore commend it for good,Thinges beloued that accumpanye pleasures. because to their weening it carieth with it a sauour of it, which they felt in them whan it was presente, by reason that in effecte our mindes conceyue an hatred against all thynges that haue accompanyed oure sorowes, and loue suche as haue accompanied oure pleasures. Upon this it commeth that vnto a louer it is most acceptable sometime to behoulde a window though it be shutte, because otherwhiles it may be hys chaunce to see his maistresse there: in like maner to see a rynge, a letter, a gardein or anye other place or what euer other thynge he supposeth hathe bene a wittinge testimoniall of his pleasures. And contrariwise, often times a faire trymmed and well decked chamber is abhorred of him that hath bene kept prysoner in it, or abidde therin any other sorow. And in my dayes I haue knowen some that will neuer drinke of a cup like vnto that wherin in their sickenesse they had taken a medicin. For euen as that windowe, ringe or letter, doeth bring to the minde a sweete remembraunce vnto the one that somuch pleaseth him, for that he imagineth it was a percell of his pleasures, so vnto the other the chamber or cuppe seemet h to bringe with the memory, his sicknes or imprisoninge againe. The verye same cause (I beleaue) moueth old men to praise the times past and discommend the present. Therfore as they talke of other thynges, so do they also of Courtes, affirminge suche as haue bene in their memory to be much more excellent and farre better furnished with notable men, then we see them to be that are now a dayes. And immediatly whan they entre into




this kinde of talke, they beginne to extoll with in finyte praises the Courtes of Duke Philip, or of Duke Borso, and declare the sayinges of Nicholas Piccininus and reherse that in those tymes a man should very

And in Courtes at that time there reigned suche good condicions and such honestie that the Courtyers were (in a maner) religious folke: and woe vnto him that shoulde haue spoken an yll word of an other, or made but a signe otherwyse then honestly to a woman. And on the other side, they say in these dayes euery thing is cleane contrary, and not onelye that brotherlye loue and manerlye conuersation loste emonge Courtyers, but also in Courtes there reigneth nothynge elles but enuye and malyce, yll maners, and a m

               st wanton lyfe in euery kinde of vice:Enuie. Women wanton. Men womanish. A paraile. the women enticefull past shame, and the men womanishe. They disprayse also the apparalle to be dishonest and to softe. To be shorte, they speake against infinite thinges, emonge the whiche many in very dede deserue to be discommended, for it cannot be excused, but there are many yll and naughtie menne emonge vs, and this oure age is muche more full of vices, then was that whiche they commende. But (me thinke) they doe full yll skanne the cause of this difference, and they bee fonde persones, because they woulde haue all goodnesse in the worlde withoute anye yll, whiche is vnpossible.Contraries For fynce yll is contrarie to good, and good to yll, it is (in a maner) necessarie by contrarietye and a certayne counterpese the one shoulde vnderprompe and strengthen the other, and where the one wanteth or encreaseth, the other to wante or encrease also: beecause no contrarye is wythoute hys other contrarye. Who knoweth not that there shoulde bee no Iustyce in the worlde, were it not for wronges? no stoutenesse of courage, were there not feynthearted? nor continency, were




there not incontinencie? nor health, were there not sickenes? nor trueth, were there not lyes?Socrates. Esopus. nor happynesse were there not mischaunces? Therefore Socrates saieth well in Plato that he marueyleth that Esope made not an Apologus or fable, wherein he mighte haue feigned that God, since he coulde neuer coople pleasure and sorowe together, might haue knit them with an extremitie, so that the beginninge of the one shoulde haue beene the ende of the other. For we see no pleasure can delite vs at anye time if sorow goeth not beefore.One contrarie foloweth an other. Who can loue rest well onlesse he haue firste felte the griefe of weerinesse? Who sauereth meate, drinke, and sleepe, if he haue not firste felt hunger, thirste, and watchinge? I beleaue therfore passions and dyseases are geuen to menne of nature, not principallye to make them subiect to them, for it wer not mete that she, whiche is the mother of all goodnesse, shoulde by her owne purposed aduise giue vs so manye euilles, but since nature doth make healthe, pleasure and other goodnesse, consequentlye after these, were ioyned diseases, sorowes and other euilles. Therfore since vertues were graunted to the worlde for a fauoure and gifte of nature, by and by were vices by that lincked contrariety necessarily accompanied with them: so that the one encreasing or wanting, ye other must in like maner encrease or want. Therfore when our olde men praise the Courtes of times past because there were not in them so vitious men, as some that are in oures, they doe not knowe that there were not also in them so vertuous men,Better wittes now then in fore
                     •
                  ime. as some that are in oures: the which is no wonder, for no yll is so euill, as that which arriseth of the corrupte seede of goodnesse. And therfore where nature now bringeth forth muche better wyttes then she didde tho, euen as they that bee geuen to goodnesse doe muche better then didde those of theyr tyme, so also they that be geuen to yll doe muche woorse. Therefore it is not to bee saide, that suche as




absteyned frome doinge ill because they knewe not howe to doe it, deserued in that case anye praise: for althoughe they dyd but a lyttle yll, yet dydde they the woorste they knewe. And that the wittes of those tymes were generally much inferiour to these now a dayes, a man may iudge by all that hath proceaded from thē, letters, peynctynges, statures, buildinges and al other thinges. Again these olde men discommende many thynges in vs, which of themselues are neyther good nor badde, onelye because they did them not: and say it is no good sight to see yonge men on horsebacke aboute the stretes and especially vpon Mules, nor to weare furres, nor syde garmentes in winter,Thinges neither good nor badd. norto weare a cappe before a man be at the least xviii. yeares of age, and such other matters, wherin truly they be much deceyued. For these facions (beside that they be commodious and profitable) are brought vp by custome, and generallye men delite in them, as at that time they were contented to goe in their iacket,Facions set-by in the olde tyme. in their breechelesse hose and in their lowe shoes with lachettes, & (to appeere fine) carye all day longe a hauke vpon their fiste, without pourpose, and daunce without touching a womans hand, and vsed many other facions, the which as they are nowe stale, so were they at that time muche set by. Therefore may it be lawefull for vs also to followe the custome of our times, without controulment of these olde men, whiche going about to praise themselues, say: Whan I was xx. yeares olde I laye wyth my mother and sisters,The sayinge of olde men. nor a great while after wiste I what women ment: and nowe children are not so soone crepte

Let them leaue therfore speakinge against our times, as full of vyces: for in takinge awaye them, they take also a way the vertues. And let them remēber




that among the good men of auncient time, when as the glorious wittes florished in the world, which in very dede were of most perfection in euery vertue, and more then manlye, there were also manye moste mischeuous, which if they had still liued, shoulde haue excelled oure yll men somuch in ill, as those good men in goodnes, & of this do all Histories make full mention. But vnto these olde men I weene I haue made a sufficient aunswer. Therfore we will leaue aparte, this discourse, perhappes to tedious, but not altogether out

Whan the day folowinge therefore was come, there was great and sundrye talke betweene the Gentlemen and Ladies of the courte vpon the disputacion of the night beefore: which arrose a greate parte of it, vpon the L. Generalles greedy desire, to vnderstande asmuch as had bene said in the matter, who had enquired it almoste of euerye manne: and (as it is alwaies wont to come to passe) it was reported vnto him sundrye wayes, for some praised one thing, some an other, and also

a great weight, Sir Friderick that is layd vpon your shoulders, and a greate expectacion that you must satisfy. Here not tariynge for Sir Friderickes answere, and what greate weight (I beseche ye) is it, said then Vnico Aretino? Who is so foolishe that whan he can do a thinge, will not do it in a fit and due time? reasoning in this wise about the matter, euery man satte him downe in his wonted place and maner with very heedfull expectacion of the propounded talke. Then Sir Friderick tourninge him to Vnico, doe you not think then, M. Vnico (quoth he) yt I am laden this night with a great & peinful burdē, since I must declare in what sorte, maner and time, the Courtier hath to practise hys good cōdicions and qualities, and to vse those other thinges that are alreadie saide to be mete for him? Me thynke it is no great matter, answered Vnico: and I beleue a good iudgement in the Courtyer is sufficient for al this, which the Count saide well yesterday nighte that he oughte to haue: and in case it be so, without any other preceptes, I suppose he may practyse welynough the thynge that hee knoweth in due time and after a good sorte. The whiche to bring more particularly into rule were to harde a matter, and perhappes more then nedeth, for I know not who is so fonde to go about his fence, whan the rest be in their musicke: or to goe about the streetes daunsing the Morisco, though he could doe it neuer so well: or goinge aboute to comfort a mother that had buried her childe, to beginne to talke with her of pleasant matters and mery conceites. I beleue surely no gentleman will do this, onlesse he wer cleane out of his wittes. Me think (M. Vnico) quoth Sir Friderick then, ye harpe to muche vppon youre extremities. For it happeneth otherwhile a man is so fonde that he remembreth not himself so easilye, and ouersightes are not all alike. And it may be, that a man shall abstaine from a common foly which is to manifest, as that is you speake of,To obserue time. to go daunce the Morisco in the market place, and yet shal he not refraine from praising himself out of purpose,




from vsing a noysome sawcinesse, from casting out otherwhile a worde thinking to make men laughe, whiche for that it is spoken out of time will appeare colde and without any grace, and these ouersightes often times are couered with a certaine veile that suffereth a manne not to forget who dothe them, onlesse he take no heede to them: and although for many causes our sight descerneth but litle, yet for ambicions sake it is darkened in especyall, for euery man willingly setteth forth himselfe in that he perswadeth himself he knoweth▪ whether this perswasion of his bee

with al men without purchasing himself enuy. The whiche howe harde a matter it is of it selfe, a man maye consider by the sildomenesse of suche as are seen to attain to that point: because we are al the sort of vs in very dede more enclined of nature to dispraise faultes, then to commende thinges well done. And a man would thinke that many by a certain rooted malice,Many

                the likenes of a fault. Therefore it behoueth oure Courtyer in all his doinges to be charie and heedfull, and what so he saith or doeth to accompany it with wisedome, and not onely to set his delite to haue in himself partes and excellent qualities, but also to order the tenour of his life after suche a trade, that the whole may be answerable vnto these partes, and see the selfe same to bee alwayes and in euery thing suche, that it disagree not from it selfe, but make one body of all these good qualities, so that euerye deede of his may be compact and framed of al the vertues, as the Stoikes say the duetie of a wiseman is: although not withstanding alwaies one vertue is the principall,Stoic

it is accompanied with sobermoode, euen so dooeth sobermood encrease and shewe it selfe the more through fiercenesse. Therefore little speaking, muche dooing, and not praising a mannes owne selfe in commendable deedes, dissemblyng them after an honeste sorte, dooeth encrease both the one vertue and the other in a person that can discreatly vse this trade: and the like is to be said in all the other good qualities. Therefore will I haue our Courtyer in that he doeth or saieth to vse certaine general rules,Generall rules. the whiche (in my minde) containe briefly asmuch as belongeth to me to speake. And for the first and chief lette him auoide (as the Count saide wel in that behalf yester night) aboue all thinges curiositie.Auoid curiosity
                     •
                  . Afterwarde let him consider wel what the thing is he doth or speaketh, the place wher it is done, in presence of whom, in what time, the cause why he doeth it, his age, his profession,Circumstances. the ende whereto it tendeth, and the meanes that may bring him to it: and so let him apply himselfe discreatly with these aduertisementes to whatsoeuer he mindeth to doe or speake. After Syr Fridericke had thus saide, he seemed to staye a whyle Then said M. Morello of Ortona: Me thinke these your rules teache but litle. And I for my parte am as skilfull now as I was before you spake them, althoughe I remember I haue harde them at other times also of friers with whom I haue bene in confession, and I weene they terme them circumstances. Then laughed Syr Fridericke and said: if you doe well beare in mynde, the Counte willed yesternighte that the chief profession of the Courtyer should bee in armes, and spake very largely in what sorte he shoulde do it, therefore will we make no more rehearsall thereof:An example of the circumstances. yet by our rule it may be also vnderstoode, that where the Courtyer is at a skirmishe, or assault, or battaile vpon the land, or in such other places of enterprise, he ought to worke the matter wisely in seperating himself from the multitude, and vndertake his notable and bould feates which he hath to do with as litle company as he can, and in the sighte of




noble men that be of most estimation in the campe, and especially in the presence and (if it wer possible) beefore the very eyes of his king or greate parsonage he is in seruice withal: for in dede it is mete to set forth to the shew thinges well done.

               th no praise at all, so is it also an yll matter to defraude a mans self of his due estimation,Praise to be sought for. & not to seke that praise, which alone is the true reward of vertuous enterprises. And I remember I haue knowen of them in my time that for all they wer of prowesse,Grosheaded persons. yet in this point they haue shewed themselues but grossheaded, and put their life in as great hasard to go take a flock of shiepe, as in being the formost to scale the walles of a batred towne, ye which our Courtyer wil not doe if he beare in minde the cause that bryngeth him to the warre,The cause to venture life is estimacion. which ought to be onely his estimation. And if he happen moreouer to be one to shewe feates of Chiualrie in open sightes at tilt, turney, or Ioco di canne or in any other exercise of the person,Open showes. remembryng ye place where he is, and in presence of whom, he shall prouide before hand to be in his armour no lesse handsome and sightly then sure,Readie in his armour. and feede the eyes of the lookers on wyth all thinges that he shall thinke may geue him a good grace, & shall do his best to gete him a horse sett out with fair harneis and sightly trappinges,A horse well trimmed. and to haue proper deuyses, apt poesies, and wittie inuentions that may drawe vnto him the eyes of the lookers on,Wittye inuentions. as the Adamant stone doth yron. He shall neuer be among the last that come furth into the listes to shewe themselues, considering the people, and especially women take muche more hede to the fyrste then to the last:Not of the laste to come furthe. because the eyes and mindes that at the begynning are greedy of that noueltye, note euerye lyttle matter and printe it, afterward by continuaunce they are not onely full, but weery of it.

Do you not nowe thinke (M. Morello) that our rules can teache somewhat? Trowe you not that friende of ours I tould you of a fewe dayes a goe had cleane forgotten with whom he spake, & why? Whan to entertein a gentilwoman whom he neuer saw before, at his first entring in talke with her, he began to tell how many men he had slain and what a hardie felow he was, and how he could play at twohandsworde and had neuer done vntill he hadde taught her howe to defende certeine strokes with a Pollaxe being armed and how vnarmed, & to shewe howe (in a mannes defence) to lay hande vppon a dagger, so that ye poore gentilwoman stood vpō thornes, and thought an houre a thousande yeare till she were got from him, for feare least he would go nigh to kil her as he had done those other. Into these errours runne they that haue not an eye to the circumstances whiche you saye ye haue heard of Friers. Therfore I say of ye exercises of the body, some there are that (in maner) are neuer practised but in open shewe, as runninge at Tilt, Barriers, Ioco di Canne, and all the reste that depende vppon Armes. Therefore whan oure Courtyer taketh any
                  •
                of these in hande, firste hee muste prouide to bee so well in order for Horse, Harneys,Well prouided for open showes. and other fournitures beelongynge thereto, that he wante nothinge. And if he see not hym selfe throughelye fournyshed in all poyntes, lette him not meddle at all. For if he dooe not well, it can not bee scused that it is not his profession. After thys, he oughte to haue a great consideration in presence




of whom he sheweth himselfe, and who be his matches. For it were not meete that a Gentilman shoulde be present in person and a doer in such a matter in the countrey, where the lookers on & the doers were of a base sort. Then saide the L. Gaspar Pallauicin. In our countrey of Lumbardy these matters are not passed vppon, for you shall see there yonge Gentilmen vpon the holy dayes come daunce al the day long in the Sunne with them of the countrey, & passe the time with them in casting the barre, in wrastling, running and leaping. And I beleue it is not ill done. For no comparason is there made of noblenesse of birth, but of force and slight, in which thinges many times the men of the countrey are not a whit inferiour to Gentilmen, & it seemeth this familiar conuersation conteineth in it a certein louely freenesse. This daūsing in the son, answered Syr Fridericke, can

                in no case away withall: & I can not see what a man shal gain by it.How to practise feates with men of the countrey. But whoso wyll wrastle▪ runne and leape with men of the countrey, ought (in my iudgement) to do it after a sorte: to proue himselfe and (as they are wonte to saye) for courtesie, not to trye maistry with them: and a man ought (in a maner) to be assured to get the vpper hand, elles let him not meddle with al, for it is to ill a sight and to foule a matter and without estimation to see a Gentilman ouercome by a Cartar and especially in wrastling. Therfore I beleue it is wel done to abstaine from it, at the leastwise in the presence of many, because if he ouercome, his gaine is small, and his losse in being ouercome very great. Also they play at tenise (in maner) alwaies in open sight, & this is one of the commune games which the multitude with their presence muche set furth.Play at tenise. I will haue oure Courtier therfore to do this and all the rest beside handlyng his weapon, as a matter that is not his profession: and not seeme to seeke or loke for any praise for it, nor be acknowen y• he bestoweth much study or time about it,The fond toyes of some. although he do it excellētly well. Neither shall he be like vnto some yt haue a delite




in musicke, and in speaking with whom soeuer alwaies whan he maketh a pause in their talke, begine in a voice as though they would sing. Other walking in the stretes or in the churches, go alwayes daunsing. Other meetyng in the market place or whersoeuer anye friende, make a gesture as though they would play at sence, or wrastle, according as their delite is. Here said the L. Cesar Gonzaga, we haue in Roomé a yong Cardinal that doeth better then so, whiche feeling him selfe lusty of person leadeth as manye as come to visit him (though he neuer sawe them before) into a gardein, and is very instant vppon them to strippe themselues into their dublet to leape with him. Syr Fridericke laughed, afterwarde he proceaded on. There be some other exersices that may be done both openly and priuately, as dauncyng: and in this I beleue the Courtier ought to haue a respecte, for yf he daunseth in the presence of many and in a place ful of people, he must (in my mind) keepe a certain dignitie,Daunsing. tempred notwithstanding with a handsome and sightly sweetnesse of gestures, and for all he feeleth himself very nimble and to haue time and measure at will, yet let him not enter into that swiftnesse of feete and doubled footinges,Daunsing

                yonge man in an olde mannes attire,Maner of disguising, but so that his garmentes be not a hindraūce to him to shew his nimblenes of person. And a man at armes in fourm of a wield shepehearde, or some other suche kinde of disguisinge, but with an excellent horse and wel trimmed for the purpose. Because the minde of the lookers on runneth furthwith to imagine the thing that is offered vnto the eyes at the first shew, and whan they behold afterward a farre greater matter to come of it then they looked for vnder that attire, it deliteth them and they take pleasure at it. Therefore it were not meete in such pastimes and open shewes, where they take vp counterfaiting of false visages,The prince in maske not to take the shap of a prince. a prince should take vpon him to be like a prince in dede, because in so doing, the pleasure that the lookers on receyue at the noueltye of the matter should want a great deale, for it is no noueltie at all to any man for a prince to bee a prince. And whan it is perceyued that beside his beinge a prince, he wil also beare the shape of a prince, he loseth the libertie to do all those thinges that are out of the dignity of a prince. And in case there should any contencion happen especially with weapon in these pastimes, he mighte easily make men beleaue that he keepeth the persone of a prince because he will not be beaten but spared of the rest: beside that, doing in sport the very same he should do in good earnest whan neede required, it woulde take away his authoritye in deede and would appeere in lyke case to be play also. But in this point the prince stripping himself of the person of a prince, and minglinge himselfe equallye with his vnderlinges (yet in suche wise that he maye bee knowen) with refusynge superioritye, lette hym caleng

Therefore I saye yt the Courtier ought in these open sightes of armes to haue the self same respect according to his degree. But in vauting,




wrastling, running & leaping, I am well pleased he flee the multitude of people, or at the least be sene very sildome times. For there is nothing so excellent in ye world,In some exercises flee the multitude. that the ignorant people haue not their fil of, and smallye regard in often beholding it.P

The like iudgement I haue in musike: but I would not our Courtier should do as many do, that assone as they come to any place, & also in the presence of great men with whom they haue no acquaintance at al,Some set out them selues vnaduisedly. without much entreating sett out themselues to shew asmuch as they know, yea & many times that thei know not, so that a man would weene they cam purposely to shew themselues for that, & that it is their principall profession.How to shew musike. Therfore let oure Courtier come to shewe his musike as a thing to passe the time withall, and as he wer enforced to doe it, and not in the presence of noble menne, nor of any great multitude. And for all he be skilfull & doeth wel vnderstand it, yet wil I haue him to dissemble the study and peines that a man must needes take in all thinges that are well done. And let him make semblante that he estemeth but litle in himself that qualitie, but in doing it excellently wel make it muche estemed of other menne. Then saide the L. Gaspar Pallauicin. There are manye sortes of musike aswell in the brest, as vpon instrumentes, therfore would I gladly learne whiche is the best, and at what time the Courtyer ought to practise it. Me thinke answered Sir Friderick, prick song is a faire musicke, so it bee done vpon the booke surely and after a good sorte.Pricke song.

Also all instrumentes with freates are ful of harmony, because ye tunes of them are very perfect, and with ease a manne may do many thinges vpon them that fil the minde with the sweetnesse of musike. And the musike of a sette of Uioles doth no lesse delite a man,
                  A sette of violes.
                  A mannes brest.
                for it is verie sweete and artificiall. A mannes breste geueth a great ornament and grace to all these instrumentes, in the which I wil haue it sufficient that our Courtyer haue an vnderstanding. Yet the more counninger he is vppon them, the better it is for him, withoute medlynge muche with the instrumentes that Minerua and Alcibiades refused,Shalmes. Dulcimers. Harpe. because it seemeth they are noisome. Nowe as touchyng the time and season whan these sortes of musike are to be practised: I beleue at all times whan a man is in familiar and louing company,Time to practise musike. hauing nothing elles a doe. But especiallye they are meete to bee practised in the presence of women, because those sightes sweeten the mindes of the hearers, & make them the more apte to bee perced with the pleasantnesse of musike, & also they quicken the spirites of the verye doers. I am well pleased (as I haue saide) they flee the multitude, and especially of the vnnoble. But the seasoning of the whole muste bee discreation,Discreation. because in effect it wer a matter vnpossible to imagine all cases that fall. And if the Courtyer be a righteous iudge of himselfe, he shall apply himselfe well inough to the tyme, and shall discerne whan the hearers mindes are disposed to geue eare and whan they are not. He shall knowe his age, for (to saie the trueth) it were no meete matter, but an yll sight to see a man of eny estimation being olde,Olde men. horeheaded and toothlesse, full of wrinckles with a lute in his armes playing vpon it & singing in the middes of a company of women, although he coulde doe it reasonablye well. And that, because suche songes conteine in them woordes of loue, and in olde men loue is a thing to bee iested at: although otherwhile he seemeth emonge other miracles of




his to take delite in spite of yeres to set a fier frosen herts. Then answered the L. Iulian: doe you not barr poore olde men from this pleasure [Syr Fridericke] for in my time I haue knowen men of yeeres haue very perfect brestes and most nimble fingers for instrumentes, muche more then some yong men. I go not about quoth Syr Fridericke, to barr olde men from this pleasure, but I wil barr you these Ladies from laughing at that folie. And in case olde men wil sing to the lute, let them doe it secretly,How olde mē should practise musike. and onely to ridde their mindes of those troublesome cares and greuous disquietinges that oure life is full of: and to taste of that excellency which I beleue Pythagoras and Socrates sauoured in musike. And set case they exercise it not at all: for that thei haue gotten a certain habit and custome of it, they shal sauour it muche better in hearing, then he y• hath no knowledge in it: For like as the armes of a smith that is weake in other thinges, because they are more exercised, be stronger then an other bodyes that is sturdy, but not exercysed to worke with his armes: euen so the eares that be exercised in musike do muche better and sooner descerne it, and with much more pleasure iudge of it, then other, how good & quicke soeuer they be that haue not bene practised in the varietie of pleasant musike: because those musical tunes perce not, but withoute leauing anye taste of themselues passe by the eares not accustomed to heare them although the very wilde beastes feele some delite in melodye. This is therfore the pleasure meete for olde men to take in musike. The self same I say of daunsing, for in dede these exercises oughte to bee lefte of before age constraineth vs to leaue them whether we will or no. It is better then, aunswered here M. Morello halfe chafed, to excepte all olde men and to saie that only yong men are to be called Courtiers. Then laughed Syr Fridericke and saide: Note [M. Morello] whether suche as delite in these matters, yf they bee not yonge men, do not study to appere yonge, and therfore dye

All ye Ladies laughed, because thei knew these wordes touched M. Morello, and he seemed somwhat out of pacience at the matter. Yet are there other enterteinmentes with women, saide immediatly Syr Fridericke, meete for olde men. And what be these, quoth M. Morillo
               ▪ to tell fables? And yt to, answered Syr Fridericke. But euery age (as you know) carieth with him his thoughtes, & hath some peculiar vertue & some peculier vice.

These then that be placed (as it were) in the extremities, it is behouffull for them to knowe howe to correct the vices with reason, that nature hath bredde in them. Therefore oughte olde men to take heede of muche praising themselues,The behauiour of olde men. and of the other vices, that we haue said are proper to them, & suffre the wisdome and knowledge to beare stroke in them that they haue gotten by lōg experience, and be (as it were) Oracles, to the whiche euerye man should haunt for counsaile, and haue a grace in vtteringe that they knowe, applying it aptlye to the purpose, accompanying with the grace of yeeres a certaine temperate and meery pleasauntnesse. In this wyse shall they be good Courtiers, and be well entertayned wyth menne and women, and euerye man will at all tymes be glad of




their companye, wythout syngynge or daunsynge: and whan neede requireth they shall showe their prowesse in matters of weighte.The behauiour of yonge menne. The verye same respecte and iudgemente sh

               ll yonge menne haue, not in keepynge the facion of olde menne (for what is meete for the one, were not in all poynctes so fitte for the other, and it is a commune sayinge, to muche grauytee in yonge menne is an yll 
                     •
                  igne) but in correctynge the natural vices in them. Therfore delite I in a yonge manne, and especiallye a man at armes, if he haue a certayne sagenesse in him and fewe woordes, and somewhat demure,Sagenesse. wythoute those busye gestures and vnquyete manners whyche we see so manye tymes in that age: for they seeme to haue a certayne gyfte aboue other yonge menne. Beesyde that, thys mylde beehauyour conteyneth in it a kynde of syghtelye fiersenesse, because it appeereth to bee sturred, not of wrathe but of iudgemente, and rather gouerned by reason then appetyte: and thys (in manner) alwayes is knowen in al menne of stomacke, and we see it lykewyse in brute beastes, that haue a certayne noble courage and stoutenesse aboue the reste: as th
                  •
                Lion and the Egle,Noble corrage in brute beastes. neither is it voide of reason, forsomuche as that violente and sodeyne mocyon withoute woordes or other token of coler whyche wyth all force bursteth oute together at once (as it were the shott of a gunn) from quietnesse, whyche is contrarye to it, is muche more vyolente and furious, then that whiche encreaseth by degrees and wexeth hott by little and little. Therefore suche as goynge aboute some enterpryse, are so full of woordes, that they leape and skip and can not stande styll, it appeereth they be rauyshed in those matters, and (as o
                  •
               re M. Peter▪ Mount sayeth well) they doe like children, that goinge in the nighte singe for feare, as though that synginge of theirs shoulde make them plucke vp their spirites to be ye boulder. Euen as therfore in a yonge man a quiet & ripe youthe is to be




commended, because it appeareth that lightnesse (whiche is the peculiar vice of that age) is tempred and corrected:Lightnesse. euen so in an olde man a grene and liuely olde age is much to be esteamed, because it appeareth that the force of the minde is so much, yt it heateth & geueth a certein strength to that feeble and colde age, & mainteineth it in that middle state, which is the better part of our life. But in conclusion al these good qualities shal not suffise oure Courtyer to purchase him the general fauour of great men, Gentlemen and Ladies, yf he haue not also a gentle and louynge behauiour in his daily conuersation. And of this I beleue verely it is a hard matter to geue anye maner rule,Behauiour in dailye conuersation. for the infinit and sundry matters that happen in practising one with an other: forsomuch as emong al the men in ye world, there are not two to be found that in euery point agree in mind together. Therfore he that must be pliable to be conuersant with so many,So many mē so many mindes.

And knowing the difference of one man & an other, euery day alter facion and maner accordyng to the disposition of them he is conuersant withall. And for my part I am not able in this behalf to geue him other rules then the aforesaid, whiche oure M. Morello learned of a child in confessing him self. Here the L. Emilia laughed and said: you would rid your handes of peines taking [Syr Fridericke] but you shall not escape so, for it is youre parte to minister talke vntill it be bed time. And what if I haue nothing to saye (madam.) Howe then? aunswered Syr Fridericke. The L. Emilia said: we shal nowe trie your wit. And if al be true I haue heard, there haue bene men so wittie & eloquent, yt thei haue not wanted matter to make a booke in the praise of a flie, other in the praise of a quartaine feuer, an other in the praise of bauldnes, doth not your hert serue you to finde oute somwhat to saie for one nyghte of Courting? We haue already, answered Syr Fridericke, spoken asmuch as wil go nigh to make two bokes. But since no excuse shal serue me, I wil speak vntil you shal think I




haue fulfilled though not my duety, yet my poure. I suppose the conuersation which the Courtier ought chiefly to be pliable vnto with al diligence to get him fauour,Conu

                   with his prince. is the very same that he shal haue with his prince. And although this name of conuersation bringeth with it a certain equalitie that a man would not iudge can reigne betweene the maister and the seruaunt, yet will we so terme it for thys once. I will haue our Courtyer therfore (beside yt he hath and doeth daily geue men to vnderstande that he is of the prowesse which we haue said ought to be in him) to turne al his thoughtes & force of minde to loue, and (as it were) to reuerence the Prince he serueth aboue al other thinges, and in his wil, maners and facions, to be altogether pliable to please him. Here without anye longer staye, Peter of Naples saide: of these▪
               To please his prince. Courtyers noweadayes ye shall finde ynow, for (me thinke) in fewe wordes ye haue peincted vs out a ioly flatterer. You are farre deceiued, answered Syr Fridericke,
               Flatterers. for flatterers loue not their Lordes nor their friendes, the which I saie vnto you I will haue principally in our Courtyer: and to please him and to obey hys commaundementes whom he serueth, may be done without flattery, for I meane the commaundementes that are reasonable and honest, or suche as of themselues are neyther good nor bad, as is gaming and pastime, and geuing himself more to some one exercise then to an other. And to this will I haue the Courtyer to frame himselfe, though by nature he were not enclined to it: so that whansoeuer his lorde looketh vpon him,His behauiour in his princis presence. he may thinke in his minde yt he hath to talke with him of a matter that he will be glad to heare. The which shal come to passe if there bee a good iudgement in him to vnderstand what pleaseth his prince and a wit and wisedom to know how to applie it, & a bent wil to make him pleased with the thing which perhappes by nature should displease him. And hauinge these principles, he shal neuer be sad before his prince nor melancholy, nor so solein as many, that a man would weene wer at




debate with their Lordes, whiche is truly an hateful matter. He shall not be yll tunged, and especiallye againste his superiours,Not yl tunged. whiche happeneth often times: for it appeereth that there is a storme in courtes that carieth this condicion with it, that alwaies looke who receyueth most benifittes at his Lordes handes, and promoted from very base degree to high astate,The most made of worst reporters. he is euermore complaynynge and reporteth woorst of hym: which is an vncomly thing, not onely for suche as these be, but euen for such as be yll handled in deede. Oure Courtier shall vse no fonde sausinesse.Not saucye. No pratler of newes. He shall be no carier about of trifling newes. He shall not be ouerseene in speakinge otherwhile woordes that may offende, where his entent was to please. He shall not be stubborne and full of contencion,Not stubborne. as some busy bodyes that a man would weene had none other delite but to vere and stirr men like flyes, and take vppon them to contrarie euery man spitefullye without respect. He shall be no babbler, not geuen to lyghtenesse, no lyar, no boaster,N

And shall not do, as many that meetinge a Prince how great soeuer he be,The behauiour of some fonde persons toward great men. yf they haue once spoken with him beefore, come towarde him with a certaine smilynge and frindly countenaunce, as though they would make of one their equall, or showe fauour to an inferiour of theirs. Uery sildome or (in maner) neuer shall he craue any thinge of his Lorde for himselfe,Why he shall not sue for him selfe. least the lorde hauing respect to denie it him for him selfe, should happen to graunte it him with dyspleasure, which is farr worse. Againe in suinge for others, he shall discreatly obserue the times, and his suite shall be for honest and reasonable matters,His sute for others. and he shall so frame hys suite, in leauinge out those poinctes that he shall knowe wil trouble him, and in making easie after a comely sort the lettes, that his Lord wil euermore graunt it him: and




though he denie it, he shall not think to haue offended him whom he ment not to doe▪ for, because greate menne often times after thei haue denied request to one that hath suid to them with great instance,The imaginacyon of princes. thinke the person that laboured to them so earnestly for it, was very greedy of it, and therefore in not obtaining it, hath cause to beare him yll will that denied him it, and vpon this suspicion thei conceiue an hatred against ye person, & can neuer afterwarde brooke him nor aforde him good countenance.He shall not presse into secret places He shall not couet to presse into the chamber or other secrete places where his Lord is withdrawen, onlesse he be bed, for all he be of great authoritie with him: because great men often times whan thei are priuatly gotten alone, loue a certain libertie to speake and do what thei please, & therefore will not be seene or herd of any person that may lightly deeme of them, and reason willeth no lesse. Therfore suche as speake against great menne for making of their chamber persons of no great qualitie in other thinges but in knowing how to attende about their person (me thinke) commit an errour:Greate men should make of their chamber men of no greate estimation. because I can not see why they should not haue the libertie to refresh their mindes, whiche we oure selues would haue to refreshe ours. But in case ye Courtyer that is inured with weightie affaires, happen to bee afterwarde secretely in chamber with him, he oughte to chaunge his coate & to differr graue matters till an other time and place, & frame himself to pleasante communicacion, and suche as his lorde will bee willing to geue eare vnto, least he hinder that good moode of his. But herein & in al other thinges, let him haue an especial regard, that he be not combrous to him. And let him rather looke to haue fauour and promotion offred him,Not to sue for p romotions. then craue it so openly in the face of the worlde, as manye dooe, that are so greedy of it, that a man would weene the not obtaynynge it, greeueth them as muche as the losse of lyfe:The griefe of some for anger. and yf they chaunce to enter into anye displeasure, or elles see other in fauoure, they are in suche anguishe of mynde,




that thei can by no meanes dissemble ye malice, & so make al men laugh them to scorne: and many times thei are the cause that great men fauour some one,Th
                     •
                   ioye of some in a meane authoritye. only to spite them withal. And afterward if thei happen to enter in fauour yt passeth a meane, they are so dronken in it, that thei know not what to do for ioy: & a man would wene that thei wist not what wer become of their feete and handes, and (in a maner) are ready to cal company to behoulde them and to reioice with them, as a matter they haue not bene accustomed withal. Of this sort I wil not haue our Courtyer to be.Behauiour in receiuynge promotion. I would haue him esteame fauour and promotion, but for al that, not to loue it so much, that a man should thinke he could not liue without it. And whan he hath it, let him not shew himself new or straunge in it: nor wonder at it whan it is offred him: nor refuse it in such sort as some, yt for very ignorance receiue it not, and so make men beleue that thei acknowledge themselues vnworthy of it. Yet ought a man alwaies to humble himself somewhat vnder his degree, and not receiue fauour & promocions so easilye as thei be offred him, but refuse them modestlye, shewing he much estemeth them, and after such a sort, that he may geue him an occasion that offreth them, to offer them with a great deale more instance: because the more resistance a man maketh in such maner to receiue them, the more doeth he seeme to the prince that geueth them to be estemed, and that the benefite whiche he bestoweth is so muche the more, as he yt receiueth it seemeth to make of it, thinking himself much honoured therby. And these are the true and perfect promotions that make men esteamed of such as se them abrode:Promotions not begged. because whan they are not craued, euerye man coniectureth they arrise of true vertue, and so muche the more, as they are accompanied with modestie. Then said the L. Cesar Gonzaga: me thinke ye haue this clause oute of the Gosspell where it is written: VVhan thou art bed to a mariage, go and sit thee downe in the lowest rowme, that whan he commeth that bed thee, he may saie, Friende come higher, and so sha

it be an honour for thee in the sight of the gestes. Syr Fridericke laughed and said: It were to great a sacrilege to steale out of the Gospell But you are better learned in scripture then I was aware of: then he proceaded. See into what daunger they fal sometime, yt rashly before a great manne entre into talke vnrequired:The rashnes of some. and manye times that Lord to skorne them withall, maketh no aunswere and tourneth his head to the other hand: and in case he doeth make aunswere, euery man perceyueth it is done full skornfullye. Therfore to purchase fauour at great mens handes, there is no better waye then to deserue it. Neyther must a manne hope when he seeth an other in fauour with a Prince, for what
                  •
               oeuer matter,To deserue fauour. in folowinge his steppes to come to the same,Not to counterfait other mens doings Some ready in their iestes because euery thing is not fitt for euery man. And ye shal finde otherwhile some one that by nature is so readie in his meerye iestes, that what euer he speaketh bringeth laughter with it, & a man would weene that he were borne onlye for that: and if another that hath a graue facion in him, of howe good a witt so euer he be, attempt the like, it will be very colde & without any grace, so that he will make a man abhorre to heare him, and in effect will be like the asse, that to counterfeyt the dogg would play with his maister. Therefore it is meete eche man knowe himselfe and his own disposicion, and applye himselfe thereto, and consider what thynges are mete for him to folow, and what are not. Before ye go anye farther, saide here M. Vincent Calmeta, if I haue well marked, me thaught ye said right now, that the best way to purchase fauour, is to deserue it: & the Courtier oughte rather to tarie till promotions bee offered him, then presumptiously to craue them. I feare me least this rule bee litle to purpose, and me thinke experience doeth vs very manifestly to vnderstande the contrarye: because noweadayes very fewe are in fauoure with Princes but such as be malapert. And I wote well you can be a good witnesse of some, that perceiuyng themselues in smal credite with




their Princis, are come vp only with presumption. As for such as come to promotion with modestie, I for my parte know none, and if I geue you respite to bethink your self, I beleue ye wil finde out but fewe. And if you marke the French Court, which at this day is one of the nobleste in all Christendom, ye shal find yt all such as are generally in fauour there, haue in them a certein malapertn
                  •
               sse, and yt not onely one with an other, but with the king himselfe. Do you not so say, answered Syr Fridericke, for in Fraunce there are very modest and courtious gentlemen.The frenche gentlemen without ceemonies. Truth it is, that they vse a certein libertie and familiaritie without ceremonies, which is proper and natural vnto them, & therefore it ought not to be termed malapertnesse. For in that maner of theirs, although they laugh and ieste at suche as be malapert, yet do they sett muche by them that seeme to them to haue any prowesse or modesty in them. Calmeta answered:Spaniardes marke ye 
               Spaniardes ye seme the very maisters of Courtly facions, and consider how many ye find yt with women and great men are not moste malapert, & so muche woorse then the Frenchemen, in that at the fyrste showe they declare a certein modesty. And no doubt but they be wise in so doing, because (as I haue said) the great men of our time do al fauour suche as are of these condicions. Then answered Syr Friderick: I can not abide (M. Vincent) yt ye should defame in this wise the great men of our time, because there be many notwithstanding ye loue modesty: the which I do not say of it self is sufficient to make a man esteamed, but I saie vnto you, whan it is accompanied with great prowesse it maketh him muche esteamed that hath it. And though of it self it lye styll, the woorthye deedes speake at large, and are much more to be wondred at, then if they were accompanied with presumption or rashnes.Many spaniardes be sawcye. I will not nowe denie but many Spaniardes there be full of malapertnesse: but I saie vnto you, they that are best esteamed, for the moste part are very modest. Agayne some other there be also so cold, that they flee the company




of menne to out of measure, and passe a certein degree of meane: so yt they make men deeme them either to fearfull or to high minded. And this doe I in no case allowe,What modestie ought to be. neyther would I haue modestie so drye and withered, that it shoulde become rudenesse. But let the Courtier, whan it commeth to pourpose, be well spoken, and in discourses vppon states, wise and expert: and haue such a iudgement that he maye frame himselfe to the manners of the countrey where euer he commeth. Then in lower matters, let him bee pleasauntly disposed, and reason well vppon euerye matter, but in especiall tende alwayes to goodnesse. No enuious person, no caryar of an yll tunge in his head: nor at anye tyme geuen to seeke prefarmente or promotion anye naughtie waye, nor by the meane of anye subtyll practise. Then saide Calmeta: I wyll assure you all the other waies are muche more doubtfull and harder to compasse, then is that you discommende: because now a dayes (to rehearse it againe) great menne loue none but such as be of that condicion. Do you not so say; answered then Syr Fridericke, for yt were to plaine an argumente that ye great menne of our tyme were all vitious and naughte, whiche is vntrue, for some there be that bee good. But if it fell to oure Courtyers lott to serue one that wer vitious and wycked, assoone as he knoweth it, let him forsake hym,What he must do in seruice with the wicked. least he taste of the bytter peine that all good menne feele that serue the wicked. We muste praie vnto god, answered Calmeta, to helpe vs to good, for whan wee are once with them, wee muste take them with all theyr faultes, for infinite respectes constraine a Gentleman after he is once entred into seruice with a Lorde, not to forsake him. But the yll lucke is in the begynnyng: and Courtyers in this case are not vnlyke vnluckye foules bread vp in an yl vale. Me thinke, quoth Syr Fridericke, duetye oughte to preuayle beefore all other respectes,Whan a man may forsake his maister▪
                but yet so a gentleman forsake not his Lorde at the warre or in anye other aduersitie, and bee thought to doe it to followe Fortune,




or because he wanted a meane to profitte by, at al other times I beleue he maye with good reason, and oughte to forsake that seruice, that among good men shall put hym to shame, for all men will imagine that he that serueth ye good, is good, and he that serueth the yll, is yll. I woulde haue you to clere me of one doubt that I haue in my head, quoth then the L. Lodouicus Pius, namely, whether a gentleman be bound or no,Howe and in what princis are to be obeied. while he is in his Princis seruice, to obey him in all thinges which he shal commaund, though they were dishonest and shamefull matters. In dishoneste matters we are not bounde to obey any body, aunswered Syr Fridericke. And what (replyed the L. Lodouicus Pius) if I be in seruice with a Prince who handleth me well, and hopeth that I will do any thing for him that may be done, and he happen to commaunde me to kyll a man, or any other like matter, ought I to refuse to do it? You ought, answered Syr Fridericke, to obey your Lorde in all thinges that tende to his profitt and honour, not in suche matters that tende to his losse and shame. Therefore yf he shoulde commaunde you to conspire treason, ye are not onely not bounde to doe it, but ye are bounde not to doe it, bothe for your owne sake and for being a minister of the shame of your Lorde.Thinges oth
                     •
                  rwhile seeme good that be yll. Truth it is, many thinges seeme at the first sight good, which are il: and many ill, yt notwithstanding are good. Therefore it is lawfull for a man sometyme in his Lordes seruice to kill not one manne alone, but tenne thousande, and to do many other thinges, which if a man waye them not as he ought, will appeare yll, and yet are not so in deede. Then aunswered the L. Gaspar Pallauici
                     •
                  . I beseche you let vs heare you speake somwhat in this case, and teach vs how we maie descerne thinges good in deede, from suche as appeare good. I pray you pardon me, quoth Syr Fridericke, I will not at this time enter into that, for there were to muche to be saide in it: but all is to be referred to your discretion. Clere ye me at the least of another doubt, replied the L. Gaspar. And what doubt is that, quoth Syr Fridericke? This aunswered the L. Gaspar: I would know




where I am charged by my maister in expresse wordes in an interprise or businesse what euer it be,Whether a man maie folow a part of his owne mind in a commission. what I haue to do therein: if I, at the deede doynge thinkynge wyth my selfe in doynge it more or lesse, or otherwise then my commission, to bringe it more prosperouslye to passe and more for his profit that gaue me that cōmission, whether ought I to gouern my selfe accordinge to the first charge withoute passinge the boundes of the commission, or elles do the thinge that I iudge to be best? Then answered Sir Friderick: In this pointe I woulde geue you the iudgemente with the example of Manlius Torquatus,
               
                  T. Manlius Torq. caused his 
                     •
                  onne to be slaine for fighting contrary to commaundement whiche in that case for ouermuch affeccion slue his sonne, if I thoughte hym woorthy great praise, which (to saie the troth) I doe not: although againe I dare not discommende him, contrarye to the opinion of so manye hundreth yeeres. For oute of doubte, it is a daungerous matter to swarue from ye commaūdementes of a mannes superiours, trusting more in his owne iudgement then in theirs, whom of reason he ought to obey: Because if his imagination faile him and the matter take yll successe, he renneth into the errour of disobedience, and marreth that he hath to doe, without any maner excuse or hope of pardon. Againe in case ye matter come well to passe accordinge to his desier,Commaundementes of the superioure poures are to be obeyed. he muste thanke his fortune, and no more a doe. Yet in this sorte a custome is brought vp to set litle by the commaundementes of the superiour poures. And by his example yt bryngeth the matter to good passe, which parauenture is a wise man and hath discoursed with reason and also ayded by fortune, afterwarde a thousand other ignoraunt persons and light headed will take a stomake to auenture in matters of moste importaunce to doe after their owne waye, and to appere wise and of authoritie, wil swarue f

               om the commission of their heades, whiche is a very yll matter, and often times the cause of infinite errours.what he that receiueth a charge ought to doe. But I beleaue in this point, the person whom the matter toucheth ought to skanne it depely, and (as it were) put in a balaunce




the goodnesse and commoditie that is like to ensue vnto him in doing contrarie to that he is charged, admytting his purpose, succede according to his hope: and counterpose on the other side the hurt and discommoditie that arriseth, if in doing otherwise then he is commaunded, ye matter chaunce to haue yll successe: and knowing that the hurt may be greater and of more importance, if it succeede yll, then the profitt, if it happen well, he ought to refrain, and in euery point to obserue his commission. And contrarywise, if the profitt be like to bee of more importaunce, if it succeede well, then the hurte, if it happen amisse, I beleue he may with good reason take in hand to do the thing that reason and iudgement shall sette before him, & leaue somewhat a side the very fourme of the commission, after the example of good marchaunt men, that to gaine much, aduenture a litle, and not much, to gaine a litle.

After he had vnderstoode how the matter passed, he sente for the poore Inginner and asked hym why he obeyed hym not, and not admyttynge anye reason he coulde alleage for hymselfe, made hym to bee strypped naked, beaten and whipped with roddes, so that he died,

But because these kynde of menne vouchesafe not to speake but with great menne I wyll not we should vouchsafe to speake of them. Then the L. Iulian, Since ye haue (quoth he) made mention of these that are so ready to felowshippe themselues with the wel apparailed, I would haue you to shew vs in what sorte the Courtier shoulde apparayle hymself, what kind of garment doeth beste become hym, and howe he shoulde fitte himselfe in all his garmentes aboute his bodye: beecause we see infinite varietie in it, and some are arayed after the Frenche facion, some after the Spanyshe attier, an other wyll seeme a Dutcheman.

then any other, and though not throughly blacke, yet somwhat darke, and this I meane for his ordinary apparaile. For there is no doubt, but vpon armour it is more meete to haue sightly and meery coulours,Coulours vpon armour. and also garmentes for pleasure, cut, pompous and riche. Likewise in open showes about triumphes, games, maskeries, and suche other matters, because so appointed there is in them a certein liuelinesse and mirth, which in deede doeth well sette furth feates of armes & pastimes. But in the rest I coulde wishe they should declare the solemnitie yt the Spanyshe nation muche obserueth,Solemnitie of spaniardes for outwarde matters manye tim

               s, are a token of the inwarde. Then saide the L. Cesar Gonzaga: I woulde not sticke muche at this, for so a gentleman be of woorthinesse in other matters, his garmentes neyther encrease nor minishe reputation. Syr Friderick answered: ye saie true. Yet whiche of vs is there, that seeing a gentleman go with a garment vpon his backe quartred with sundry coulours, or with so many points tyed together, and al about with lases and fringes set ouerthwart, will not coūt him a very disard or a commune iestar? Neither disard, quoth M. Peter Bembo, nor iestar woulde a man count him, that had liued any while in Lumbardy, for there they go all so. Why then, aunswered the Dutchesse smylyng, if they go all so, it ought not to bee obiected to them for a vice, this kinde of attier being as comely and proper to them, as it is to the Venetians to weare their longe wyde sleeues, and to the Florentines, their hoodes. I speake no more of Lumbardy, quoth Syr Fridericke, then of other places, for in euery nation ye shall finde bothe foolishe and wyse. But to speake that I thinke is most requisite as touching apparaile, I will haue the Courtier in all his garmentes handsome and clenlye, and take a certain delite in modest Precisenesse, but not for all that after a womanish or lyghte maner, neither more in one point, then in an other, as we see many so curious about their hear,Delites of men. that they forget all the rest. Other delite to haue their teeth faire. Other in




their beard. Other in buskines. Other in cappes. Other in coyffes. And so it commeth to passe, that those fewe thinges whiche they haue clenly in them, appeere borowed ware, and all the rest, whiche is most fonde, is knowne to be their owne. But this trade wil I haue our Courtier to flee by my counsel, with an addition also, that he ought to determine with himselfe what he will appeere to be, and in suche sorte as he desireth to bee esteamed so to apparaile himselfe, and make his garmentes helpe him to be counted suche a one, euen of them that heare hym not speake, nor see him doe anye maner thyng. I thinke it not meete, quoth then the L. Pallauicin, neyther is it vsed emong honest menne to iudge mennes conditions by their garmentes, and not by their woordes and deedes, for many a manne might be deceiued: and this prouerb arriseth not without cause: the habit maketh not the Monke. I say not▪ answered Syr Friderick, that menne shoulde geue a resolute iudgement by this alone, of mennes conditions, and that they are not knowen by wordes and deedes, more then by ye garmentes. But I saie that the garment is withall no small argument of the fansie of him that weareth it,The 
                     •
                  armēt iudgeth the mynde. although otherwhile it appeere not true. And not this alone, but all the beehauiours, gestures and maners, beeside wordes and deedes, are a iudgement of the inclination of him in whom they are seene. And what thynges be those, aunswered the L. Gaspar, that you fynde we maye geue iudgement vpon, yt are neyther woordes nor deedes. Then said Syr Fridericke: You are to subtill a Logicien, but to tell you as I meane,Operations. some Operations there are that remayne after they are done, as buylding, writynge, and suche other: Some remayn not, as these yt I meane now. Therefore doe I not counte in this pourpose, goynge, laughyng, lookyng, and suche matters to bee Operations, and notwithstandyng outwardly doe geue many times a knowledge of that is within. Tell me, dyd you not geue your iudgemente vpon that friende of oures we communed

So in like maner whan you see one gase earnestely with his eyes abashed, lyke one that had lytle witt: or that laugheth so fondly as doe those dombe menne,

Ye may see them that these beehauiours; maners and gestures, whiche I mynde not for this tyme to terme Operations, are a great matter to make menne knowne. But me thynke there is an other thyng that geueth and dimynisheth muche reputation: nam
                  •
               ly, the choyse of friendes, with whom a manne must haue inwarde conuersation. For vndoubtedly reason wylleth that suche as are coopled in streicte amitie and vnseperable companye, should be also alike in wyll, in mynde,Chois

                  s. in iudgemente and inclination. So that who so is conuersaunt wyth the ignoraunt or wycked, he is also counted ignoraunt and wycked. And contrariwise he that is conuersaunt with the good, wyse, and dyscreete, he is reckened suche a one. For it seemeth by nature, that euerye thing doeth willingly felowshippe with his lyke. Therefore I beleaue that a man oughte to haue a respect in the first beeginning of these frendshippes, for of two neere friendes, who euer knoweth the one, by and by he ymagineth the other to bee of the same condition. Then aunswered M. Peter Bembo: To bee bounde in frendshyppe with suche agreemente of mynde as you speake of, me thynke in deede a manne ought to haue great respect, not onely for getting or leesing reputation, but because nowe adaies ye finde very fewe true friendes. Neyther doe I beleaue yt there are any more in the world, those Pylades & Orestes, Theseus and Perithous, nor Scipio and Laelius▪
                but rather it happeneth dailye, I wote not by what destinye,




that two friendes whiche manye yeeres haue lyued together with most hartie loue, yet at the ende beguile one an other, in one maner or other, either for malice, or enuye, or for lightnesse, or some other yll cause: and eche one imputeth the faulte to his felow, of that which perhappes both the one and the other deserueth. Therfore because it hath happened to me more then once to bee deceiued of hym whom I loued beste, and of whom I hoped I was beloued aboue anye other person, I haue thought with my selfe alone otherwhile to bee well done, neuer to put a mannes trust in any person in the worlde, nor to geue himselfe so for a prey to friend how deere and louing so euer he wer, that without stoppe a manne shoulde make him partaker of all his thoughtes, as he woulde his owne selfe: because there are in our mindes so many dennes and corners, that it is vnpossible for the witt of manne to knowe the dissymulations that lye lurking in them. I beleaue therefore that it is well done to loue and awaie with one more then another, according to the desertes and honesty: but not for all that so to assure a mannes selfe, with this sweete bait of frendship, that afterwarde it shoulde be to late for vs to repente. Then Syr Fridericke, Truely (quoth he) 
                  •
               he losse shoulde bee much more then the gain, if that high degree of friendshippe shoulde bee taken from the felowshippe of manne,Frendshippe necessarye for the lyfe of mā
                whiche (in mine opinion) ministreth vnto vs all the goodnes conteined in our life: and therefore wyll I in no case consente to you, that it is reasonable; but rather I can finde in my heart to conclude, and that with moste euident reasons, that without this perfect friendship, men wer much more vnluckie, then all other liuyng creatures. And albeit some wicked and prophane taste of this holye name of friendship, yet is it not for all that to be so rooted oute of mennes mindes; and for the trespasse of the yll, to depriue the good of so great a felicitie. And I beleaue verely for my parte, there is here emong vs moe then one couple of friends, whose loue is indissoluble and without




any guile at all, & to endure vntill death, with agreement of will, no lesse then those menne of olde time, whom you mentioned right nowe. And so is it alwaies, whan beside the inclination that commeth from aboue, a man chouseth him a friende lyke vnto himselfe in conditions. And I meane the whole to consist emong the good and vertuous menne, because the friendship of the wicked,Frend shippe of two together. is no friendshippe. I allowe well that this knott, which is so streicte, knitt or binde no mo then two, elles were it in a hasarde: for (as you know) three instrumentes of musike are hardlier brought to agree together then two. I woulde haue our Courtier therefore to finde him oute an especiall and hartie friende, if it were possible, of that sort we haue spoken of. Then according to their desertes and honesty, loue▪ honour, and obserue all other menne, and alwaies do hys beste to felowshippe himselfe with menne of estimation that are noble and knowen to bee good, more then with the vnnoble and of small reputation, so he be also beloued and honoured of them. And this shall come to passe if he be gentle, lowely, freeherted, easie to be spoken to,A mans duetie towarde his friend. & sweete in company, humble and diligent to serue, and to haue an eye to his friendes profitt and estimation, as wel absente as present, bearing with their naturall defaultes that are to be borne withall, without breaking with them vpon a small grounde, and correcting in himselfe such as lou

               es, & alwaies seeke cause to complaine of their friendes, which is a most hatefull thing. Here whan Sir Friderick had made a stay, the L. Gaspar Pallauicin saide: I would haue you to expresse somewhat more particularlye this conuersation




with friendes, then you doe, for in deede ye keepe your self to muche in the generall, and touch vnto vs thinges (as it were) by the waie. Howe by the waye aunswered Syr Fridericke? Woulde you haue me to tell you also the verye woordes that a manne muste vse? Suppose you not then we haue sufficientlye communed of this? I thynke yea, aunswered the L. Gaspar. Yet doe I desier to vnderstand also some particular point of the maner of enterteinment emong menne and women, whiche (me thynke) is a verye necessary matter, consideryng the moste parte of a mans tyme is spent therein in Courtes, and if it were alwayes after one maner wyse, a manne would soone wexe weerye of it. Me thynke, aun
                  •
               wered Syr Fridericke, we haue geuen the Courtier a knowledge in so many thynges, that he maye well varye his conuersation and frame hymselfe accordynge to the inclination of them he accompanyeth hymself withall, presupposyng him to be of a good iudgemente, and therewithall to guyde hymself. And according to the time otherwhile, haue an eye to graue matters and sometyme to pastimes & games. And what games, quoth the L. Caspar? Syr Friderick aunswered: Lette vs aske counsel of Frier Seraphin that daily inuenteth newe. But in good earneste, replied the L. Gaspar, doe you not thynke it a vice in the Courtier to plaie at Dice and Cardes?Dice and Cardes. I thynke it none, quoth Syr Fridericke, onlesse a man apply it tomuch, & by reason of that, setteth aside other thynges more necessary, or elles for none other entent but to get money, and to beguile his felow, and in his losse, fume and take on so, that it might be thought a token of couetousnesse. The L, Gaspar answered:The play at Chestes. and what say you to the game at chestes? It is truely an honest kynde of of enterteynmente & wittie, quoth Syr Friderick. But me think it hath a fault, whiche is, yt a man may be to couning at it, for who euer will be excellent in the playe of chestes, I beleaue he must beestowe much tyme about it, and applie it with so much study, that a man may assoone learne some noble scyence, or

Therfore in this I beleaue there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency. The L. Gaspar answered: There be many Spaniardes excellent at it, & in many other games, whiche for all that bestowe not muche studye vpon it, nor yet lay aside ye compassing of other matters. Beleaue not the contrarye aunswered Syr Fridericke,
               Spaniardes dissemble their study in the play at Chestes. but they beestowe muche studye vpon it, although feiningly. As for those other games ye speake of beeside chestes, parauenture they are like many which I haue seen that serue to small pourpose, but onely to make the cōmune people wonder. Therfore (in mine opinion) thei deserue none other praise or reward, then the great Alexander gaue vnto him, ye standyng a farr of, did so well broch Chiche peason vpon a nedle. But because fortune, as in manye other thinges, so in the opinion of men seemeth to beare a great stroke, it is

Therefore whan he commeth into his presence without any acquaintance before hande, with the reste about him, though he be wittie & ready in his answeres, & showeth himself handsomly wel in his beehauiours, in his conditions & wordes, & in what euer belongeth vnto him, yet wil that Lord sett light by him, & rather geue hym an yll countenance, then esteame him: and of this wil arrise that the rest immediatly will frame themselues to their lordes mind, & it shall seeme vnto euery man yt he is litle worth, neyther will any manne regarde hym, or make of him, or laugh at his pleasante sayinges, or set any thing by hym, but will beeginne all to serue him sluttish pranckes, and make him a Cousin, neyther shall good aunsweres suffyce the poore soule, nor yet the takynge of thynges as spoken in ieste, for euen the verye Pages wyll bee at hym,

Therefore wil I haue our Courtier the best he can (beside his worthinesse) to help himself with witt and art, and whan euer he hath to goe where he is straunge and not knowen, let him procure there goe first a good opinion of him, beefore he come in person, and so woork, that they maie vnderstand there, howe he is in other places with Lordes, Ladyes and gentlemen in good estimation:Good opinion. because that fame, which seemeth to arrise of the iudgementes of many, engendreth a certeine assured confidence of a mans worthinesse, which afterwarde finding mennes mindes so settled and prepared, is easily with deedes mainteined and encreased, beeside that a man is eased of the trouble that I feele, whan I am asked the question who I am, and what is my name. I can not see what this can helpe, aunswered M. Bernard Bibiena, for it hath sundry tymes happened vnto me, and I beleue to many moe, after I had grounded in my mynde by reporte of manye menne of iudgemente a matter to bee of great perfection beefore I had seene it, whan I had once seen it, it feinted muche, and I was muche deceiued in mine imagination, and this proceaded of nothyng elles, but of geuing to muche credit to fame and reporte,Report deceiueth. and of conceiuinge in my minde so greate an opinion, that mea

               uring it afterwarde with the trueth, the effecte, thoughe it were greate and excellente, yet in comparison of that I




had imagined of it, seemed very sclender vnto me. Euen so (I feare me) maye also come to passe of the Courtyer. Therefore I can not see howe it were well done to geue these expectations, and to sende that fame of a man beefore: because oure mindes manye times facion and shape thinges, whiche is vnpossible afterwarde to aunswere to and fulfill,The report of thinges that the eye is iudge of▪ may deceyue. and so doeth a man lose more then he gayneth by it. Here Sir Friderick saide: Thinges that vnto you and many moe are lesse in effect then the fame is of them, are for the most part of that sort, that the eye at the first sight maie geue a iudgemente of them. As if you haue neuer been at Naples or at Roome, whan you here men cōmune of it, you imagine muche more of it, then perhappes you find afterwarde in sight. But in the conditions of menne it is not alike, because that you see outwardly is the least part. Therefore in case the first daie you heare a gentlemanne talke, ye perceiue not the worthinesse in him that you had beefore imagined, you doe not so soone lose the good opinion of him, as you doe in the thinges wherein your eye is by and by a iudge.

Now heare a pretye chaunce. It happened no longe time after, that a letter which this last gentlewoman writt vnto her louer came to the handes of another, that was a noble woman of excellent qualities and singular beawtye, who beeinge (as the most part of women are) inquisitiue and greedie to vnderstande secretes and especyallye of other women, opened the letter, and in readinge it perceyued it was written with an extreeme affection of loue. And the sweete woordes full of fire that she reade, firste moued her to take compassyon on that Gentlewoman (for she knew verie well from whom the letter came and to whom it went) afterward they had suche force, that skanning them in her minde, and consideringe what maner a man this was like to be, that could bring ye woman

And in case you would tell all, this good felowe thus fauoured of so manie women was some doult, and a man in deede not to be regarded, because the maner of them is alwayes to cleaue to the woorst, and like sheepe to do that they see the first do, bee it well or yll: beeside that they be so spitefull emong themselues▪ that if he had bene a monstrous creature they would surelye haue stolen him one from an other.

Afterward she said smilinge: If the yll which you speake of women were not so farr wide from the truth, that in speakinge it, it hurteth and shameth rather the speaker then them, I would suffer you to be answered. But I will not haue you, in speaking agaynste you wyth a number of reasons, forsake thys youre yll custome, because you may be sharplie punished for this offence of yours: which shall be with the ill opinion that all thei wil conceiue of you that heare you talke in this wise. Then aunswered Syr Fridericke: Saye not, my L· Gaspar,



               
that women are so voide of reason, though somtime they applie themselues to loue more, through the iudgemente of others then their owne, for great men and many wyse men, doe often times the like. And if it be lawfull to tell ye troth, you your selfe and all we here haue many tymes, & doe at this presente credit the opinion of others, more then our owne. And that it is true, not long agoe there were certein verses showed here, that bore the name of Sanazarus, and were thought of euery bodie very excellent, and praised out of reason,What opinion doeth. afterwarde whan they wer certeinly knowen to bee an other mannes doyng, they loste by and by their reputation, & seemed worse then meane. And where there was song in the Dutchesse presence, here a certein Antheme, it neuer delited nor was reckened good, vntil it was knowen to be the doing of Iosquin de Pris. But what token will you haue more plainer of opinion? Doe you not remember where you your selfe dranke of one self wine, sometime ye said it was most perfect, and an other time, without al taste? and that because you had been perswaded they were two sortes, the one of the Coost of Genua, and the other of this soile: and whan the errour was opened, by no meanes you woulde beleaue it: that false opinion was grounded so stifly in your head, whiche arrose notwithstanding of other mennes woordes. Therefore ought the Courtier diligently to applie in the beeginning to geue a good imprinting of himself, and consider what a harmefull and deadly thing it is, to runne in the contrarie.Men that conter

For suche men many times enter into certein matters, which whan thei can not gete out again, will afterwarde helpe them selues with raising laughter, and it is done with so yll a grace yt it will in no wise frame, whereby they bring a very great




lothsomenesse vpon as manie as see or heare them, & they remain very colde and without any grace or countenance. Sometime thinking thereby to bee subtill witted and ful of iestes, in the presence of honourable women, yea, and often times to them themselues,Filthy talke. they thrust out filthie & most dishonest woordes: and the more they see them blush at it, the better Courtiers they recken themselues, & styll they laugh at it, and reioyce emong themselues at thys goodlie vertue they thinke thei haue gotten them. But they practise this beastlinesse for none other cause, but to bee counted Good felowes.
               Good felowes. This is the name alone whiche they deeme woorthie praise, and whiche they bragg more of, then of anye thing elles, and to gete it them, thei speak the foulest and shamefullest villanies in the world. Many times they shoulder one an other downe the stayers,Ruffianlye pranckes. and hurle billettes and brickes, one at an others head. They hurle handfulles of dust in mens eyes. Thei cast horse and man into ditches, or downe on the side of some hill. Then at table, potage, sauce, gelies, and what euer commeth to hande, into the face it goith. And afterwarde laughe: and whoso can doe most of these trickes, he counteth himselfe the best and galantest Courtyer, and supposeth that he hath wonne great glorye. And in case otherwhile they gete a gentleman in these their pleasaunt pastimes, that will not geue himselfe to suche horseplay, they say by and by: He is to wise, we shall haue him a Counseller, he is no good felowe. But I will tell you a worse matter. Some there bee that contende and laye wager, who can eate and drinke more vnsauerye and stincking thinges, and so abhorryng & contrary to mans senses, that it is not possible to name them, without very great lothsomenesse. And what thinges be those, quoth the L. Lodouicus Pius? Syr Friderick aunswered: Let the Marquesse Phebus tell you, for he hathe often seen it in Fraunce, and perauenture felte it. The Marquesse Phebus aunswered: I haue seen none of these thinges done in Fraunce more then in Italy. But looke what

I wil not now proceade to speake any more particularly of matters to well knowen, as that oure Courtier ought not to professe to be a glutton nor a




dronkard, nor riotous and vnordinate in any il condicion▪ nor filthy and vnclenly in his liuing, with certaine rude & boysterous beehauiours that smell of the plough and cart a thousand mile of, for he that is of that sort, it is not only not to be hoped that he will make a good Courtier, but he can be set to no better vse then to kepe sheepe. And to conclude, I saye that (to doe well) the Courtier oughte to haue a perfect vnderstandinge in that we haue sayde is meete for him, so that euery possible thinge may be easye to him, and all men wonder at him, and he at no manne: meaning notwithstanding in this poinct yt there be not a certaine loftye and vnmanerlye stubburnnesse,Some commende not thynges well done. as some men haue that showe themselues not to wonder at the thinges which other men do, because they take vpon them that they can do them much better: and with their silence discommend them as vnworthy to be spoken of, and wyll make a gesture (in a maner) as though none beeside were (I will not say their equall, but) able to conceyue the vnderstanding of ye profoundnes of their couning.

Such triflinge folyes I will not haue our Courtier to speake of. But me thinke whan occasion is offred to showe his skill in a matter he is altogether ignoraunte in, it is well done to auoide it. Yf necessitie compell him,How he should doe in a matter he hath no skil in. let him rather confesse plainly his lack of vnderstanding in it, then hasard himself, and so shall he auoide a blame that manye deserue nowadayes, which I woote not through what corrupte inward motion or iudgement out of reason, do alwayes take vpon them to practise the thinge they know not, and lay aside that they are skilfull in: and for a confirmation of this, I know a very excellent musitien,Men that take in hand thinges they haue no skill in. which leauing his musike a part hath whollye geuen himselfe to versifiynge, and thynketh hymselfe a great clearke therin, but in deede he maketh euerye man to laughe him to skorne, and now hath he also cleane lost his musike.

Some there be that knowing themselues to haue an excellency in one thing, make their principall profession in an other, in which not withstanding they are not ignorant, but whan time serueth to show themselues in that they are most skilfull in, they doe it alwayes verie perfectlye: and otherwhile it

This quoth Syr Fridericke, is rather an ornament that accompanyeth the thinge he doeth, then a deceite: and though it be a deceite, yet is it not to be disalowed. Will you not saye also, that he that beateth his felow, where there be two plaiyng at fence together, beeguyleth hym, and that is bicause he hath more art then the other.

I say therfore in the first kinde, whiche is a meerye maner of expressinge, there needeth no art, bicause verye nature her self createth and shapeth menne apt to expresse pleasantly and geueth them a countenaunce, gestures, a voice, and woordes for the pourpose to counterfeit what they luste.

And so tourning him to Count Lewis and to M. Bernarde Bibiena, he said vnto them. These be the maisters of this facultie, of whom in case I must speake of meerie saiynges, I must first learne what I haue to saye. Count Lewis answered: Me thynke you beegin nowe to practise that you saye ye are not skilfull in, whiche is, to make these Lordes laughe in mocking M.

Now although men be not of such worthinesse as they were in those daies, yet perhappes the gates that are made, a great sorte of them, especiallye here in Roome, of auntient Marble, haue the same vertue they had then. And for my parte I beleaue that these two will cleere vs of all our doubtes, in case we will aske counsell of them. Then those Gentilmen mused much at the matter and attended to see to what end it woulde come, whan Sir Anthony folowinge on still vp and downe lifte vp his eyes, as at a sodeine, to one of the two gates of the hall where they walked: and stayinge a while with his finger he showed his companye the inscriptyon ouer it, which was Pope Alexanders name, and at the ende of it was V and I, bicause it should signifie (as ye knowe) the sixt.

Now let vs see if we may of this other vnderstand anye thinge of the newe Bishoppe: and tournyng him as at auenture to the other gate, pointed to the inscription of one N. two PP. and ene V. whiche signifieth Nicholaus Papa Quintus,

He must also in this counterfeiting take heed of to much taunting in touching a man,Nippes that touch a man. especially in the ill fauourednesse of visage or yll shape of bodye. For as the mishappes and vices of the bodie minister manie times ample matter to laughe at, if a man can discreatly handle it, euen so ye vsinge of this maner to bytingly is a token not onlie of a commune iester, but of a plaine ennemy.

And so for all the Duke repeted sundrie times, the greater the pitt was, the more earth should be cast out of it, yet coulde he neuer make it sinke into his braine, but it might be made so large yt it mighte receiue both the one and the other: and he answered him nothinge elles but make it so much the larger. Now see what a good forecast this Abbot had. Then said M. Peter Bembo: And why tell you not that, of your great Capitain of Florence that was beeseaged of the Duke of Calabria within Castellina? Where there were found vpon a day in the towne certeine quarelles poysoned that had bine shott out of the campe, he wrott vnto the Duke, yf the warr should procead so cruellye, he would also put a medicin vpon his gunnstones, & then he that hath the woorst, hath his mendes in his handes. M. Bernarde laughed and saide: Yf you houlde not youre peace (M. Peter) I will tell whatsoeuer I haue seene my selfe and hearde of your Venetians, which is not a litle, and especially when they play the riders. Doe not I beesech ye, answered M. Peter, for I will keepe to my selfe two other verie pretye ones that I knowe of your Florentines.

               M. Bernarde saide: They are rather of the Seneses, for it often happeneth emonge them. As within these fewe dayes one of them hearing certein letters read in the Counsell chamber, in which for auoidinge to often repetition of his name that was spoken of, this terme was manie times put in, il Prelabato (wh

               L. Emilia and bash not for y• matter. M. Peter said, whan the Lordes of Florence were in warr against the Pisanes, they were otherwhile out of money by reason of theyr great charges, & laying their heades together vpon a daye in the counsell chambre what waye were beste to make prouision to serue their tourne withall, after many diuises propounded, one of the auntientest Citizins said: I haue founde two wayes,A florentines deuise. wherby without much trauaile we may in a small while come by a good portion of money. Wherof the one is (bicause we haue no redier rent then the custome at the gates of Florence) where we haue XI gates, let vs with speede make XI mo, and so shall we double oure reuenue. The other way is, to set vp a mint in Pistoia and an other in Prato no more nor lesse then is here within Florence: and there doe nothinge elles daye and night but coyne money, and all Ducates of golde, and this diuise (in mine opinion) is the speedier and lesse chargeable. They fell a laughing apace at the subtill diuise of this Citizin and whan laughinge was ceased the L. Emilia said: Will you (M. Bernarde) suffre M. Peter thus to ieste at Florentines without a reuenge? M. Bernarde answered smilinge: I pardon him this offence, for where he hath displeased me in iestinge at Florentines, he hath pleased me in obeyinge of you, the which I would alwaies do my selfe.

And whan one of his companions demaunded him what kynde of musike did please hym best of all




that he had heard there, he said: All were good, yet emong the rest I saw one blowe in a straunge trumpett, whiche at euerye pushe thrust it into his throte more then two handful, and then by and by drew it out again, and thrust it in a freshe, that you neuer sawe a greater wondre. Then they all laughed, vnderstandinge the fonde imagination of him that thoughte the blower thruste into his throte that part of the Sagbout that is hid in puttinge it backe againe. Then M. Bernarde went forward: Those Affectations and curiosities that are but meane, bringe a lothsomnesse with them, but whan they be done oute of measure they much prouoke laughter. As otherwhile whan some men are heard to speake of their auntientrye and noblenesse of birth: sometime women of their beawtie and handsomenesse: As not long ago a Gentilwoman did, which at a great feast beinge verie sad & musing with her s

Such Affectacions as these be bicause they passe the degree, doe rather prouoke laughter then lothsomnesse.

Tell it vs, quoth the Dutchesse. The L. Iulian said smilinge: This merchaunt man (as he saith) beeinge vpon a time in Polonia,

This merchaunt man of Luca trauailing then with his companie toward Moscouia, arriued at the riuer of Boristhenes,

                which he found hard frosen like a marble stone, and saw the Moscouites, which for suspicion of warr were in doubt of the Polakes, were on the other side, and neerer cam not than the breadth of ye riuer. So after they knewe the one the other, makinge certein signes, the Moscouites beegan to speake aloud & toulde the price how they would sell their Sables, but ye colde was so extreme, that they were not vnderstood, bicause the woordes beefore they cam on the other syde where thys merchaunt of Luca was and his interpreters, were congeled in the aere and there remayned frosen and stopped. So that the Polakes that knew the maner, made no more adoe but kindled a great fire in the middest of the riuer (for to their seeminge that was the point wherto the voice came hott beefore the frost tooke it) and the riuer was so thicke frosen yt it did well beare the fire. Whan they had thus done the wordes that for space of an houre had bine frosen, beegan to thawe and cam doune, making a noyse as doeth ye snow from the mounteignes in Maye, and so immediatlye they were well vnderstood, but the men on the other side were first departed, and bicause he thought that those woordes asked to great a price for the Sables, he woulde not bargaine, & so cam awaye without. Then they laughed all. And M. Bernarde, Truelye (quoth he) thys that I wyll tell you is not so subtill, yet is it a pretye matter. and this it is. Where talke was a fewe dayes ago of

               ers brought from thens, that friend I toulde you of, affirmed that he had seene an Ape, verie diuers in shape from such as we are accustomed to see, yt played excellently well at Chestes. And emong other times vpon a day beefore the king of Portugal ye Gentilman that brought herr played at Chestes with herr, where the Ape showed some draughtes very suttill▪ so that she put him to his shiftes, at length she gaue him Checkemate. Upon this the gentilman beeinge somwhat vexed (as communlie they are all that lose at that game) tooke the kinge in his hande whiche was good and bigg (as the facion is emonge the Portugalles) and reached the Ape a great knocke on the heade.To lose at chestes vexeth men. She furthwith leaped aside complayning greatly, and seemed to require iustice at the kinges handes for the wrong done her. The gentilman afterward called her to play with him again, the whiche with signes she refused a while, but at last was contented to play an other game, and as she had done the other time beefore, so did she now driue him to a narrow point. In conclusion: the Ape perceiuinge she could giue the gentilman the mate, thought with a newe diuise she would be sure to escape without any mo knockes, and priuilie conueyed her right hande without makinge semblant what her entent was, vnder the gentilmans left elbowe, leaning for pleaser vpon a litle taffata coushin, and snatchinge it slightlie awaye, at one instant gaue him with her left hande a mate with a paune, and with her right hande caste the coushin vpon her heade to saue her from strokes, then she made a gamboll beefore the king ioifully, in token (as it were) of her victory.

gete a name in a straunge countrey. At this euery manne laughed, both for the lye and for the addition made to it by the L. Cesar. So proceadinge on in his talke M. Bernarde
                said: You haue vnderstoode therfore what Iestes are that be of effect and communication without interruption asmuche as cummeth to mynde: therfore it shall be well nowe we speake of such as consist in one sayinge alone, and haue a quicke sharpenesse that lyeth breefly in a sentence or in a word.

                  phurnius was so named, bicause he was wont to heate fourneyses. And vpon a day whan I asked Phedra how it happeneth, where prayer is made in the Church vpon goodfridaye not onlie for Chrystyans, but also for Paganes and for Iewes, there was no mention made of the Cardinalles, as there was of Bishops and other prelates. He answered me, yt the Cardinalles were conteined in the Collet, Oremus pro haereticis et Schismaticis. And oure Count Lewis saide that I reprehended a ladie of loue for occupyinge a certein kinde of lye that shined muche, bicause whan she was trimmed therwithall, I might see my selfe in her face, and for that I was yll fauoured I coulde not abyde to looke vpon my selfe. In this maner was that M. Camillo Paleotto saide vnto M. Anthonio Porcaro, whiche reasoninge of a companion of his that vnder confessyon had sayde vnto the Priest that he fasted with all his harte, and went to Masse and to holye seruice and did all the good deedes in the worlde, said: This felowe in stead of accusynge prayseth hym self. Unto whom M. Camillo answered: nay, he rather confesseth himself of these matters, bicause he reckeneth the doinge of them great sinn. Do you not remember how well the L. Generall said the last daye, whan Iohnthomas Galeotto wondred at one that demaunded two hundreth Ducates for a horse? for whan Iohnthomas saide that he was not worth a farthinge, bicause emong other yll properties he had, he could not abide weapons, neyther was it possible to make him come nighe where he sawe anye, the L. Generall said (willing to reprehende him of cowardise)

               le he asketh not a thousand Ducates. Also sometime a man speaketh the verie same woord, but to another ende then the commune vse is. As, whan the Duke was passing ouer a very swift riuer, he said to the trompetter: goo on. The trumpetter tourned him backe with his cappe in his hande and after a reuerent maner, saide: It shalbe youres my lorde. It is also a pleasant maner of iestinge, whan a man seemeth to take the woordes and not the meaninge of him that speaketh. As this yeere a Dutch man in Roome meetinge in an Eueninge oure M. Phillipp Beroaldo whose Scholar he was, said vnto him:

As within these fewe dayes a Priest of the Countrey sayinge Masse to his parishioners, after he had toulde them what holye dayes they shoulde haue that weeke, he beegane the generall confession in the name of all the people, and sayde: I haue synned in yll dooynge, in yll speakynge, in yll thynkynge, and the rest that foloweth, makynge mentyon of all the deadlye sinnes. Then a Gossippe of his and one that was verye familyar wyth the Priest to sporte with hym, saide to the standers bye: Beare recorde, Sirs, what he confesseth with hys owne mouth he hath done, for I entende to present him to the Bishoppe for it. The verye same maner vsed Sallazza della Pedrata to honoure a Ladye of loue wythall. With whome en

               ringe in talke, after he had praysed herr beeside her vertuous qualities for her beawtie also, she answered him that she




deserueth not that praise, bicause she was now well striken in yeeres. And he then said to her: That is in you of age, is nothing elles but to liken you vnto the aungelles, whiche were the firste and are the auntientest creatures that euer God made. Also meerie sayinges are muche to the pourpose to nippe a man, aswell as graue sayinges to praise one, so the metaphors be well applyed, and especiallye yf they be answered, and he that maketh answere continue in the self same metaphor spoken by the other. And in this sorte was answered to M. Palla Strozzi,
               
                  Palla Strozzi.
                whiche banished out of Florence, and sendinge thither one of his about certein affaires,
                  Cosimo de Medici.
                said vnto him after a threatninge maner: Tell Cosmus de Medicis in my name that 
                  The henn sitteth abroode. The messenger did the errand to him, as he was wylled. And Cosmus without any more deliberacion, answered him immediatlye: Tell M. Palla in my name again, that Hennes can full yll sitt abroodé out of the nest. With a metaphor also M. Camillo Porcaro commended honorablye the Lorde Marcantonio Colonna,
               The Lorde Marcus Anthonius Columna.
                who vnderstandynge that M. Camillo in an Oration of hys had extolled certein noble men of Italy that were famous in marcial prowesse, and emonge the rest had made most honorable mention of him, after rendringe due thankes, he said to him: You (M. Camillo) haue done by your friendes as some merchaunt men play by their money, which findinge a counterfeit Ducat, to dispatch him away, cast him into a heape of good ones and▪ so vttre him: Euen so you, to honour me withall, where I am litle woorth, haue sett me in company with so excellent and vertuous personages, y• through their prowesse, I may perauenture passe for a good one. Then M. Camillo made answere: They that vse to counterfeit Ducates, gylte them so that they seeme to the eye much better then the good: therfore if there were to be founde counterfeiters of menne, as there be of Ducates, a man might haue a iuste cause to suspect you were false, beeinge (as you are) of much more faire and brighter mettall




then any of the rest. You may see that this place is commune both for the one and the other kinde of Iestes, & so are manie mo, of the which a man might geue infinite examples, and especially in graue sayinges. As the great Capitain saide, whiche (beeinge sett at table and euerye roume filled) sawe two Italian Gentilmen standinge bye that had done him verye good seruice in the warr, sodainly he start vp and made all the rest to arrise to giue place to those two, and said: Make roume Sirs for these gentilmen to sitt at their meat, for had not they bine we should not haue had now wherwithall to feade our selues. He saide also to Diego Garzia that perswaded hym to remoue out of a daungerous place that lay open vpon gunnshott: Sins god hath not put feare into your mynd, put not you it into myne. And kinge Lewis,
               
                  Lewis the xij
                which is nowe Frenche kinge, where it was saide vnto him soone after his creation, that then was the time to be euen with his enemies that had done him so much iniurye while he was Duke of Orleans. He made answere: That the French kinge hath nothing ado to reuenge the wronges done to the Duke of Orleans. A man toucheth also in Iest manye times with a certein grauitie without mouing a man to laughe. As Gein Ottomani 
               
                  ••
               other to the great Turke,
                  Gein Ottomani
                whan he was prisoner in Roome, he said: Iustinge (as we vsed it in Italy) seemed to him ouergreat a daliaunce, and a tryfle to yt should be in deede. And he said, whan it was tould him that kinge Ferdinande the yonger was nimble and quycke of person in renning, leapinge, vautynge and suche matters, in his country slaues vsed these exercises, but great men learned from their childhood liberalitie and were renowmed for that. And in a maner after the same sort, sauinge it had a litle more matter to laughe at, was that the archbishopp of 
                  Florence
                said vnto Cardinal Alexandrino, That men haue nothinge but 
                  Substance, a body and a soul: Their 
                  Substance
                is at Lawyars disposynge, their Bodye at Phisitiens, and their Soul at diuines. Then answered




the L. Iulian: A man might ad vnto this the saiynge of Nicholetto: wh
                  •
               ch is, that it is seldome seene a Lawyer to go to lawe, nor a Phisitien take medicin, nor a diuine a good Christian. M. Bernarde
                laughed, then he proceaded: Of this there be infinite examples spoken by great Princes and verie graue men.Comparasons▪
                But a man laugheth also manye times at comparasons. As oure Pistoia wrott vnto Seraphin: I sende thee backe again thy great male whiche is like thy selfe. If ye remember well Seraphin was muche like a male. Again, there be some that haue a pastime to liken menne and women to horses, to dogges, to birdes, and often times to coffers, to stooles, to cartes, to candelstickes, which somtime hath a good grace and otherwhile verye stale. Therfore in this point a man must consider the place, the time, the persones, and the other thinges we haue so manie times spoken of, Then spake the L. Gaspar Pallauicin: The comparason that the L. Iohn Gonzaga made of Alexander the great to M. Alexander his son, was verye pleasant. I wote not what it was, answered M. Bernarde. The L Gaspar said: the L. Ioh
                     •
                  
                was playinge at dice (as his vse is) and had lost a numbre of Ducates and was still on the losinge hande, and M. Alexander his sonn, which for all he is a childe delyteth no lesse in playe then his father, stoode verie still to beehould him and seemed verye sad. The Count of Pianella, that was there present with manye other Gentilmen, said: See (my Lorde) M. Alexander is verie heauie for your
                  •
                losse, and his hert panteth waytinge whan lucke will come to you that he may gete some of your winninges: therfore rid him of this griefe, and beefore ye lose the rest, gyue hym at the least one Ducat that he maye goe playe him too, emonge hys companyons. Then sayde the L. Iohn: You are deceyued, for Alexander thynketh not vpon suche a trifle, but as it is wrytten of Alexander the great, while he was a childe, vnderstandinge that Philipp his father had dyscomfited a great armie, and conquered




a certein kingdome, he fell in weepinge, and whan he was asked the question whye he wept, he answered, bicause he doubted that his father would conquerr so manye Countryes, that he should haue none left for him to conquerr: Euen so nowe Alexander my sonne is sorye and readye to weepe in seeinge me his father lose, bycause he doubteth that I shall lose so much, that I shall leaue him nothinge at all to lose. Whan they had a whyle laughed at this M. Bernarde
                wente forwarde. A man must take heede also hys ieslynge be not wicked, and that the matter extende not (to appeere quy

               witted) to blasphemye, and studye therin to inuent newe wayes:Blasphemye. Least herein, where a manne deserueth not onelye blame, but also sharpe punishment, he should appeere to seke a praise, which is an abhominable matter. And therfore suche as these be, that goe about to shew their pregnant witt wyth small reuerence to Godward, deserue to be excluded out of euerye Gentylmans companye. And no lesse,Filthy and baudie persons in talke. they that be filthye and bawdye in talke, and that in the presence of women haue no maner respect, and seeme to take none other delite but to make women blushe for shame, and vpon thys goe seekynge oute meerye and iestynge woordes. As thys yeere in Ferrara at a banckett in presence of manye Ladyes there was a Florentine and a 
                  Senese, whiche for the moste parte (as you knowe) are ennemies together. The 
                  Senese
                sayd to nipp the Florentine: We haue maryed Siena to the Emperour and giuen him Florence in dowerye. And this he spake bicause the talke was abrode in those dayes, that the Seneses had giuen a certein quantitie of money to the Emperour, and he tooke the protection of them vpon him. The Florentine answered immediatlye: But Siena shalbe first ridden (after the Frenche phrase, but he spake the Italian



               
worde) and then shall the do werye afterward be pleaded for at good leyser. You may see the taunt was wittie, but bicause it was in presence of women it appeered baw die and not to be spoken. Then spake the L. Gaspar Pallauicin: Women haue none other delite but to heare of such matters, and yet will you depriue them of it. And for my part I haue bine ready to blushe for shame at woordes which women haue spoken to me oftener then men. And I speake not of such women as these be, quoth M. Bernarde, but of the vertuous that deserue to be reuerenced and honoured of all gentilmen. The L. Gaspar saide: It were good we might finde out some pretie rule howe to knowe them, bicause moste communlie the best in apparance are cleane contrarye in effect. Then said M. Bernarde
                smylinge: Were not the L. Iulian here present that in euerye place is counted the protectour of women, I woulde take vpon me to answere you, but I will not take his offyce from him. Here the L. Emilia in like maner smilinge, said: Women neede no defendoure againste an accuser of so small authoritie. Therfore let ye 
               L. Gaspar alone in this his froward opinion, risen more bicause he could neuer finde woman that was willynge to loke vpon him, then for anye want that is in women, and proceade you in youre communication of Iestes. Then M. Bernarde, trulye madam (quoth he) me thinke I haue named vnto you manie places, out of the which a man may pike pleasant and wittie sayinges, which afterward haue so much the more grace, as they are set furth with a comelie protestacion. Yet may there be alleaged manie other also, as whan to encrease or diminish, thinges be spoken that vncrediblye passe the likelihoode of truth. And of this sort was that Marius da Volterra said by a prelate that thought himselfe so taule a person, that as he went into Saint Peters, he stowped for hittinge his heade againste the greate beame ouer the porche. Also the L. Iulian here saide that Golpino hys seruaunte was so leane and drie, that in a morning as he




was blowing the fire to kendle it, the smoke bore him v
                  •
                the chimney vnto the tonnell, and had gone awaye with him had he not stooke on crosse at one of the holes aboue▪ And M. Augustin Beuazzano toulde, that a couetous man ne whiche woulde not sell hys corne while it was at a hi g he price, whan he sawe afterwarde it had a great falle, for desperacion he hanged himself vpon a beame in his chamber, and a seruaunt of his hearing the noise, made speede, and seeing his maister hang, furthwith cut in sunder the rope and so saued him from death: afterwarde whan the couetous man came to himselfe, he woulde haue had hys seruaunt to haue paide him for his halter that he had cut. Of this sort appeareth to be also that 
                  Laurence 
                  de Medici
                     •
                  
                said vnto a colde iester: thou shouldest not make me laugh if thou ticklidest me. The like he answered vnto an other foolishe person, who in a morninge had found him in bed verie late and blamed him for sleepinge somuche, sayinge vnto him: I haue now bine in the new and olde markett place, afterward I went oute at the gate of San Gallo to walke about the walles, and haue done a thousande 
                  •
               
               ther matters, and you are yet in bed. Then said 
                  Laurence: that I haue dreamed in one houre is more woorth, then al that you haue done in foure. It is also pretie whan one reprehendeth a thinge which a man would not thinke he minded to reprehende. As the marquesse Friderick of Mantua oure Dutchesse father, beeinge at table wyth manye gentilmen, one of them after he had eaten vp his dishe of broth, said: By your leaue my L. marquesse. And whan he had so said, he beegane to suppe vp the rest that remayned in the dishe. Then said the marquesse by and by: Aske leaue of the swyne, for thou doest me no wronge at all. Also M. Nicholas Leonicus said, to touch a noble manne that was falselye reported to be liberall: Gesse you what liberalitye is in him, that doeth not onlye geue awaye hys owne good but other mens also. That is in like maner an honest and comelie kinde of iesting that consisteth in a




certein dissimulacion, whan a man speaketh one thinge and priuilie meaneth another.Dissimulacion. I speake not of the maner that is cleane contrarye, as if one shoulde call a dwarf a giaunt: and a blacke man, white: or one most ilfauoured, beawtifull, bicause they be to open contraries, although otherwhile also they stirr a man to laughe. But whan with a graue and drie speache in sportinge a man speaketh pleasantlie that he hath not in his minde. As whan a gentilman tould M. Augustin Folietta a loude lye and earnestlye did affirme it, bicause he thought he scase beleaued it. At laste M. Augustin said: Gentilman, if you will euer do me pleaser, be so good to me as to quiet your selfe in case I do not beleaue anye thinge you saye. Yet whan he replied again and bound it with an othe to be true, at lengthe he saide: Sins you wyll haue me, I am content to beleaue it for youre sake, for to saye the trueth I would do a greater thinge for you then this commeth to. In a maner after the same sorte Don Giouanni di Cardona said of one that woulde forsake Rome: In mine opinion thys felowe is yll aduysed, for he is so wicked that in abidinge in Rome it maye be his chaunce in time to be made a Cardinall. Of this sorte is also that Alphonsus Santacroce
                said, whiche a litle beefore hauinge certein iniuries done him by the Cardinall of Pauia, and walking without Bolonia with certein Gentilmen nighe vn to the place of execution, and seeinge one newlye hanged there, tourned him that waye with a certein heauie looke and said so loude that euery man might heare him: Thou art a happie man that hast nothinge adoo with the Cardinal of Pauia.
               Iesting groū
                  ded vpon scoffinge meete for great men. And the kinde of iestinge that is somewhat grounded vpon scoffinge seemeth verie meete for great men, bicause it is graue and wittie and may be vsed both in sportynge matters and also in graue. Therfore dyd manye of olde time and menne of best estimatyon vse it: As Cato, Scipio, Affricanus minor. But aboue all they saye Socrates t

               Alphonsus the first of Aragon: which vpon a time as he went to diner tooke manye ryche iewelles from his fingers, for wetting them in washinge hys handes, and so gaue them to him that stoode nexte him as thoughe he had not minded who it was. This seruaunt had thought sure the king marked not to whom he gaue them, and bicause his heade was busied with more waightie affaires, wold soone forgete them cleane, and therof he tooke the more assurance, whan he sawe the Kinge asked not for them again. And whan the matter was passed certein dayes, wekes and monthes without hearinge anye woord of it, he thought surelye he was safe. And so about the yeeres end after this matter had happened, an other time as the kinge was in like maner going to diner, he stepped furth and put out his hande to take the kinges ringes. Then the kinge rounding him in the eare, said: The first is well for thee, these shall be good for an other. See this taunt how pleasant, wittie and graue it is,To name an yll thing with honest woordes. and woorthie in verie deede for the noble courage of an Alexander. Like vnto this maner grounded vpon scoffinge there is also an other kinde, whan with honest woordes, a man nameth a vitious matter or a thinge that deserueth blame.Frumpe

As the great Capitain said vnto a Gentilman of hys, that after the iourney of Cirignola and whan all thinges were alreadye in safetye, mett him as richelye armed as might be, readye to fight. Then the greate Capitain tourninge to him Don Vgo di Cardona, saide: Feare ye not now any more Seatempest, for Saint Hermus hath appeered. And wyth thys honeste woorde he gaue him a nicke. Bicause you knowe Saint Hermus doeth alwayes appeere vnto Mariners after a tempeste and gyueth a token of caulme. And the meaning of the great capitain was, that whan this gentilman appeered it was a signe the daunger was alreadye cleane past. Again M. Octauian Vbaldi
                     •
                  o beeinge in Florence in companye wyth certein of the




best Citizins and reasoninge together of souldiers, one of them asked him whether he knewe Antonello da Forli whiche was then fled out of the state of Florence. M. Octauian answered: I haue no great knowledge of him, but I haue heard him alwaies reported to be a quicke souldier. Then said an other Florentin. It appeereth he is quicke, for he taried not so longe as to aske leaue to depart. They be also pretie tauntes whan a man of the verie communication of his felowe taketh that he would not, and my meaning is in that sort, as our Duke answered the Capitain that lost Saint Leo.
               Pope Alexander .vj. vsurped the dukedome of Vrbin and gaue it to hys sonne Cesar Borgia. communlye called Duca valentino.
                Whan this state was taken by Pope Alexander and giuen to Duke Valentin, the Duke beeing in Venice at that time I speake of, manie of his subiectes came continually to giue him secret information how the matters of state passed, and emonge the rest, thither came also this Capitain, whiche after he had excused himselfe the best he coulde, laiynge the fault in his vnluckinesse, he saide: My Lorde doubt ye not, my hart serueth me yet to woorke a meane that Saint Leo may be recouered again. Then answered the Duke: trouble not thy self any more about that, for in losinge it thou haste wrought a meane that it may be recouered again. Certein other sayinges there are, whan a man that is knowen to be wittie speaketh a matter that seemeth to proceede of folye. As the last day M. Camillo Paleotto said by one: that foole, as soone as he beegane to were riche, died. There is like vnto this maner a certein wittie & kinde dissimulacion, whan a man (as I haue said) that is wise maketh semblant not to vnderstande that he doth vnderstande.Dessimulacion. As the marquesse Friderick of Mantua, which beeing sued too by a prating felow yt complained vpon certein of his neighbours takinge the Pigions of his Douehouse with snares, and helde one continuallye in his hande hanging by the foote in a snare, which he had founde so dead, he answered him that there should be a remedye for it. This felow neuer satisfied, not once but manye a time repeted vnto him his




losse, showinge alwaies the Pigion so hanged, and saide still: But I besech you, howe thinke ye (my Lorde) what should a man do in this matter? The marquesse at length said: By mine aduise ye Pigion ought in no wise to be buried in ye Church, for sins he hath so hanged himself, it is to be thought that he was desperat. In a maner after the same sorte was that Scipio Nasica said vnto Ennius. For whan Scipio went vnto Ennius house to speake with him & called to him in the streete, a maiden of his made him answere that He was not at home, And Scipio heard plainlye Ennius himselfe saye vnto his mayden to tell hym that he was not at home, so he departed. Within a while after Ennius came vnto Scipioes house, and so likewise stoode beneethe and called him. Unto whom Scipio himselfe with a loude voice made answere that, He was not at home. Then said Ennius: What, do not I knowe thy voice? Scipio answered: Thou hast smalle Courteysie in thee, the last day I beleaued thy maiden that thou waste not at home, and now wilt not thou beleaue me my selfe? It is also pretie whan one is touched in the verie same matter that he hath first touched his felowe.To touche in the same matter a man is touched. As Alonso Carillo beeinge in the Spanishe Court and hauynge committed certein youthfull partes that were of no great importance, was by the kinges commaundement caried to prison, and there abode for one night. The next day he was taken out again, and whan he came to the Palaice in the morninge, he entred into ye chamber of presence that was full of gentilmen & Ladies, and iestynge together at this his imprisonment, maistresse Boadilla saide: M. Alonso, I tooke great thought for this mishap of yours, for al yt knew you were in feare least the kinge wold haue hanged you. Then said immediatlye Alonso: In deede maistresse, I was in doubte of the matter my selfe to, but yet I had a good hope that you would haue begged me for your husbande. See howe sharpe and wittie this is.The maner of Spaine.
                Bicause in 
                  Spaine
                (as in many other places also) the maner is, whan a manne is lead to




execution, if a commune harlot will aske him for her husbande, it saueth his life. In this maner also did Raphael the pein
                  •
               ter answere two Cardinalles (with whom he might be familiar) which to make him talke, found fault in his hearinge with a table he had made, where Saint Peter and Saint Paul were: saiynge, that those twoo pictures were to red in the face. Then said Raphael by and by: My lordes, wonder you not at it, for I haue made them so for the nones, bicause it is to be thought that Saint Peter and Saint Paul are euen as red in heauen as you see them here, for verie shame that their Churche is gouerned by such men as you be.A semblant of laughing. Also those Iestes are pleasant, that haue in them a certein priuie semblant of laughter. As whan a husband lamented much and bewayled his wief that had hanged her selfe vpon a figgtree, an other came to him and pluckynge him by the slieue, said: friend, may I receiue suche pleaser as to haue a graff of that figgtree to graff in some stocke of myne Orcharde? There be certein other Iestes that be pacient and spoken softlie with a kinde of grauitie. As a man of the Countrye caryinge a coffer vpon his shoulders, chaunced therwithall to gyue Cato a harde pushe, and afterward said: Giue roume. Cato answered:With a certe
                     •
                  n grauitie. Haste thou anye thinge vpon thy shoulders beeside that coffer? It is also a matter of laughter whan a man hath committed an errour and to amend it speaketh a matter pourposelye that appeereth foolishe, and yet is applyed to the ende that he hath appointed, and serueth hys tourne therwithall that he seeme not oute of countenaunce and dismayed.A matter that seemeth foolishe. As not longe sins two ennemies beeinge together in the Counsell chamber of Florence (as it happeneth often in those Commune weales) the one of them,
                  Altouiti.
                which was of the house of Altouiti, slept, and he that satt next vnto him for a sporte, where his aduersarye that was of the house of Alamanni,
               
                  Alamanni.
                had said nothinge neyther then nor beefore, stirringe him wyth his elbowe made him awake, and saide vnto him: Hearest




thou not what suche a one saith? Make answere, for the Lordes aske for thine aduise. Then did Altouiti all sleepie arrise vpon his feete and without anye more deliberation said: My Lordes, I say the cleane contrarye to that Alamanni hath spoken. Alamanni answered: what? I haue said nothinge. Altouiti saide inmediatlye: To that thou wilt speake. In this maner also did youre M. Seraphin the Phisitien here in Vrbin saye vnto a manne of the Country, which had receyued suche a stroke vpon the eye, that in verie deede it was oute, yet thought he beste to go seeke to M. Seraphin for remedie. Whan he saw it thoughe he knewe it was past cure, yet to plucke money out of his handes as that blowe had plucked the eye oute of his heade, he promised him largelye to heale it. And so he was in hande with him euerye day for money, puttinge him in comforte that within sixe or seuen dayes, he shoulde beegine to see wyth it agayn. The poore countrye manne gaue him the litle he had, but whan he sawe him so prolonge the matter, he beegane to finde himself agreeued wyth the Physitien, and sayde that he was nothinge the better, neyther coulde he see anye more wyth that eye, then if he had hadd none at all in hys heade. At length M. Seraphin perceyuynge there was no more to be gotten at hys handes, saide: Brother myne, thou muste haue pacience, thou haste cleane lost thine eye and no remedye is there for it, praye God thou lose not thyne other wythall. The Countrye manne seeynge thys, fell in weepynge, and lamented muche and saide: Mayster myne, you haue pylled me and robbed me of my money, I will complayne to the Duke, and made the greatest outcryes in the worlde. Then sayde M. Seraphin in a rage and to cleere hymselfe: Ah thou vyllein knaue: thou wouldest then haue two eyes as Cityzins and honest menne haue, wouldest thow? Get thee hence in the Dyuelles name. And these woordes were thruste oute wyth suche




furie that the poore selie manne was dismayed, and held his peace,To enterpret a matter meerely. and soft and faire departed in gods name, thinking that he himselfe had bine in the wronge. It is also pretie whan a man declareth or enterpreteth a matter meerilie. As in the Spanishe Court in a morning there came into ye Palaice a knight who was very ylfauoured: and his wief, that was verie beawtifull, both apparailed in white Damaske,
               
                  Dame aske.
                and the Queene said vnto Alonso Carillo: Howe thinke ye Alonso by these two? Madam, answered Alonso, me thinke the Ladye is the Dame, and he the aske, which signifieth a foule person and vglesome. Also whan Raphael de Pazzi sawe a letter that the Priour of Messina had written to a maistresse of his, the superscription whereof was:This letter be geuen to the cause of my griefe. 
               Esta carta s

                  ha da dar a qui en causa mi penar, me thinke (quoth he) this letter is directed to Paul Tholossa. Imagine you how the standers bye laughed at it, for they all knew that Paul Tholossa had lent tenn thousand Ducates to the Priour of Messina, and bicause he was verie lauishe in his expences, he could finde no waye to pay his dett. It is like vnto this,Familiar admonition in maner of counsell. whan a man geueth familiar admonition in maner of counsell, but dissemblinglie. As Cosmus de Medicis said vnto a friend of his that had more riches then wit, and by Gosmus meanes had compassed an office without Florence, and at his settinge furthe askinge Cosmus what way he thought best for him to take to execute this office well: Cosmus answered him: Apparaile thy selfe in scarlate, and speake litle. Of this sort was that Count Lewis said vnto one that woulde passe for an vnknowen person in a certein daungerous place, and wist not howe to disguise himself, and the Count beeinge demaunded of hys aduise therin, answered: Apparaile thy selfe like a Doctour, or in some other rayment that wise men vse to weare. Also Iannotto de Pazzi said vnto one that minded to make an armynge coat of as manye diuers colours as might be inuented: Take the woordes and deedes of the Cardinall of Pauia.
               matters disagreeinge: A man laugheth also at certein matters disagreeinge. As one said the




last daye vnto M. Antony Rizzo of a certein 
                  Forliuese
               : Gesse whether he be a foole or no, for his name is Bartholomew.
               That seeme to agree. And an other: Thou seekest a rider and hast no horses. And this man wanteth nothinge but good & a horse. And at certein other that seeme to agree. As within these few dayes where there was a suspicion that a friend of oures had caused a false aduoucion of a benifice to be drawen out, afterward whan an other Priest fell sicke. Antony Torello saide vnto him: What doest thou lingre the matter,That agree not: whie doest thou not sende for thy Clerke and see whether thou cannest hit vpon this other benefyce? Likewise at certein that doe not agree. As the last day whan the Pope had sent for M. Iohnluke of Pontremolo and M. Dominick dalla Porta, which (as you knowe) are both crookbacked, and made them Auditours,The Rota in Roome is suche an other matter as the Court of the Arches in England. sayinge that he entended to bringe the Rota into a right frame M. Latin Iuuenal saide: Oure holie father is deceiued yf he thinke that he can bringe the Rota into a right frame with two crooked persons. Also it prouoketh laughter, whan a man graunteth the thinge that is toulde him and more, but seemeth to vnderstande it otherwise. As Capitain Peralta beeing brought into the listes to fight the combatt wyth Aldana and Capitain Molart that was Aldanas patrine requiringe Peralta to sweare whether he had about him any Saint Iohns Gosspell or charme and inchauntmente, to preserue him from hurt. Peralta swore that he had about him neyther Gosspell, nor inchauntment, nor relike, nor any matter of deuocion wherein he had any faith. Then said Molart to touch him to be a

                It is pretie moreouer to vse metaphors at a time in such pourposes. As oure M. Marcantonio that said to Botton da Cesena, who had vexed him with woordes: Botton, Botton, thou shalt one day be the botton, and the halter shalbe the bottonhole. And also whan Marcanconio had made a comedye whiche was verie longe and of sundrye actes▪



               
man will vse. And althoughe all kinde of Iestes moue a man to laugh,Diuerse effectes in iestes. yet do they also in this laughter make diuerse effectes. For some haue in them a certein cleannesse and modest pleasantnesse. Other bite sometime priuily, otherwhile openlye. Other haue in them a certein wantonnesse. Other make one laughe assone as he heareth them. Other the more a man thinketh vpon them. Other in laughinge make a man blushe withall. Other stirr a man somewhat to angre. But in all kindes a man must consider the disposition of the mindes of the hearers bicause vnto persons in aduersitie oftentimes meery toyes augment their affliction: and some infirmities there be, that the more a man occupieth medicine aboute them, the woorse they were. In case therfore the Courtier in iestinge and speakinge meerie conceytes haue a respecte to the time, to the persons, to his degree, and not vse it to often (for parde it bringeth a lothsomnesse if a man stand euermore about it, all day in all kinde of talke and without pourpose) he maye be called pleasant and featconceyted. So he be heedefull also that he be not so bitter and bitinge, that a man mighte coniecture he were an enuious person in prickinge without a cause, or for plaine malice, or men of to great authoritie (whiche is lacke of discreation) or of to much miserie (which is crueltye) or to mischeuous (which is vanitie) or elles in speakinge matters that may offende them whom he would not offende (which is ignoraunce.) For some there be that thinke they are bound to speake and to nippe without regard, as often as they can, howe euer the matter goe afterwarde. And emonge these kinde of persons are they,The smalle respect some haue in iestinge. that to speake a woord which should seeme to come of a readinesse of witt▪ passe not for staynynge of a woorthie gentilwomans honesty, which is a very naughtie matter and woorthie sore punishment. Bicause in this point women are in the number of selie soules and persons in miserye, & therfore deserue not to be nipped in it, for they haue not weapon




to defende themselues. But beeside these respectes he that wilbe pleasant and full of iestinge, must be shaped of a certein nature apt to all kinde of pleasantnesse, and vnto that frame his facions, gestures and countenaunce, the which ye more graue, steadie & sett it is, somuch the more maketh it the matters spoken to seeme wittie and subtil. But you (Sir Fridericke) that thought to rest your selfe vnder this my tree without leaues & in my withered reasoninges, I beleaue you haue repented youre selfe, and you recken ye are entred into the baytinge place of Montefiore.

Nay, answered Sir Fridericke, I am come to so good an hosterie, that I minde to tarye in it lenger then I had thought at the firste. Therfore I will rest me yet a while. vntill you haue made an ende of all the talke ye haue beegone withall. Wherof ye haue left oute one percell that ye named at the beeginning: whiche is, Meerie Pranckes, and it were not well done to deceyue the companye of it. But as you haue taught vs manie pretie matters concerninge Iestes, and made vs hardie to vse them throughe example of so many singular wittes, great men, Princis, Kinges and Popes, I suppose ye will likewise in Meerie Pranckes so boulden vs, that we maye take a courage to practise some against you your selfe. Then said M. Bernarde smilinge: You shall not be the firste, but perhappes it will not be your chaunce, for I haue so manie times bin serued with them, yt it maketh me looke wel about me: As dogges, after they haue bine once scaulded with hott water, are aferd of the colde.

                I beleaue I may rid my handes of it in fewe woordes. And in mine opinion a Meerie Prancke is nothinge elles, but a friendlye deceit in matters that offende not at all or verie little. And euen as in Iestynge to speake contrary to expectacyon moueth




laughter, so doeth in Meerie Pranckes to doe contrarie to 
                  〈◊〉
               . And these doe so muche the more delite and are to be praised, as they be wittie and modest. For he that

                offende and then arrise debates and fore hatred. But the places that a man may diriue Merie Pranckes from are (in a maner) the verie same that be in Iestes. Therfore to auoide repetition of the
                  •
               , I will say no more but that there be two kyndes of Meerie Pranckes, euerye one of which may afterwarde be diuided into mo partes. The one is, whan any man whoeuer he be, is deceyued wittilie, and after a feat maner and with pleasantnesse. The other, whan a manne layeth (as it were) a nett, and showeth a piece of a bayte so, that a man renneth to be deceyued of himself. The first is suche, as the Meerie Prancke was, that within these fewe dayes was wrought vnto a coople of greate Ladyes (whom I will not name) by the meane of a Spaniarde called Castilio. Then the Dutchesse, and whie (ꝙ she) will you not name them? M. Bernarde answered: Bicause I would not haue them to take it in yll part. Then said the Dutchesse again, smilinge: It is not againste good maner sometime to vse Meerie Pranckes with great men also. And I haue heard of manie that haue bine played to Duke Fridericke, to kinge Alphonsus of Aragon, to Queene Isabel of Spaine, and to manie other great Princis, and not onlie they tooke it not in ill part, but rewarded very largely them that plaied them those partes. M. Bernarde answered: neyther vpon this hope do I entend to name them. Say as pleaseth you quoth the Dutchesse. Then proceaded M. Bernarde and said: Not manie dayes since in the Court that I meane, there arriued a manne of the Countrie about Bergamo, to be in seruice wyth a Gentilman of the Court: whyche was so well sett oute with garmentes and so finelye clad; that for all hys brynginge vp was alwayes in keapinge Oxen and could doe nothinge elles, yet a manne that had not hearde




him speake woulde haue iudged him a woorthie Gentilman. And so whan those two Ladies were enfourmed that there was arriued a Spaniarde, seruaunt to Cardinall Borgia whose name was Castilio, a verie wittie man, a musitien, a daunser and the best Courtier in all 
                  Spaine, they longed verie much to speake with him, and sent incontinentlye for him, and after they had receyued him honorablye, they caused him to sitt downe, and beegan to entertein him with a verie greate respect in the presence of all menne, and fewe there were present that knew him not to be a Bergamask Cowherd. Therfore seeinge those Ladies enterteine him with such respect, and honour him so muche, they fell all in a laughyng, the more bicause the seelie felowe spake still his natyue language the meere Bergamaske tunge.The woorst speach in all Italy. But the Gentilmen that diuised this Prancke, had first toulde those Ladyes that emonge other thinges he was a great dissembler and spake all tunges excellentlye well, and especiallye the Countrie speache of Lumbardye so that they thought he feigned, and manie tymes they beehelde the one the other with certein marueilinges, and saide: What a wonderfull matter is this, howe he counterfeyteth this tunge? In conclusion thys communication lasted so longe that euerye mans sydes aked for laughinge, and he could not chouse himselfe but vttre so manye tokens of hys noblenesse of birth, that at length those Ladies (but with muche ado) beleaued he was the man that he was in deede.

The other two after they had played a while, agreed to woorke a Meerie Pranke with him that was gone to bed. And whan they perceyued that he was fallen in sleepe, they blew out the candels and raked vp the fire and beegane to speake aloude, and to make the greatest hurly burlye in the worlde, makinge wise to contende together about their game.

The one of the two answered: I weene thou hast lost thy sight aswel as thy money. Seest thou not that we haue here two candels? He that was in bed lift vp himselfe vpon his elbowes and in a maner angred, said: Eyther I am dronken or blinde, or elles you make a lye. The two arrose and went to bed darkelong, laughinge and makinge wise to beleaue that he went about to mocke them. And he again saide to them: I tell you troth I see you not. At length the two beegane to seeme to wonder much, and the one saide to the other: By good Lord, I beleaue he speaketh in good earnest, reach me the candell, and lett vs see least perhappes he haue some impediment in his sight.

                  Aquapendente
                and the other townes here about to seeke for some Phisitien,
                  Aquapendente is a towne of the Popes xii. miles from Paglia
                and will helpe the in what we can. Then did the seelie soule kneele vpon his knees in the bed, and wyth aboundance of teares and verie bitter repentance for his blaspheminge, made a solemne vow to go naked to our ladye of Loreto and to offre vnto her a paire of eyes of siluer, and to eate no flesh vpon the wenesdaye nor egges vpon the Fridaye, and to faste bread and water euery Saturday in worship of our lady: Yf she giue him ye grace to receyue his sight again. The two companions entringe into an other chamber, lighted a candell, and came with the greatest laughter in the world beefore this poore soule, who for all he was rid of so great an anguish as you may thinke he had, yet was he so astonied with his former feare, that he could not onlye not laugh, but not once speake a woord, and the two companions did nothinge elles but sturr him, saiynge that he was bounde to perfourme all those vowes, for that he had receiued the grace he asked. Of the other kynde




of Meerie Pranckes whan a man deceyueth himselfe, I will giue you none other example,Whan a man deceiueth himselfe. but what happened vnto me my selfe not longe sins. For this shroftide that is past, my Lordes grace of Saint Peter ad vincula, which knoweth full wel what a delite I haue whan I am in maskerie to play Meerie Pranckes with friers, hauinge first giuen order as he had diuised the matter, cam vpon a daye with my L. of Aragon & certein other Cardinalles, to the windowes in the banckes, making wise to stande there to see maskers passe to and fro, as the maner of Roome is. I being in maskerie passed bye, and whan I behelde on the one side of the streete a frier standinge (as it were) in a studye with himselfe, I iudged I had found that I sought for, and furthwith rann to him, like a greedye hauke to her preye, and whan I had asked him and he toulde me who he was, I made semblant to knowe hym, and wyth manye woordes beegane to make him beleaue that the marshall went about to seeke him for certein complaintes against him, and persuaded him to go with me to the Chauncerye and there I would saue him. The frier dismayed and all tremblinge seemed as thoughe he wist not what to do, & said that he doubted taking in case he should go far from Saint Celso. Still I put him in good comfort, and saide somuche to him that he leaped vp beehinde me, and then me thought my diuise was fully accomplished. And I beegane to ride my horse by and by vp and downe the merchauntes streete, which went kicking & winsing. Imagine with your selues now what a faire sight it was to beehould a frier on horsebacke beehinde a masker, his garmentes fleeing abrode & his head shaking to and fro, that a man would haue thought he had bine alwaies falling. With this faire sight, the gentilmen beegane to hurle egges out at the windowes, and afterwarde all the bankers and as many as were there, so that the haile neuer fell with a more vyolence from the skye, then there fell egges out from the windowes▪ whiche for the moste




part came all vpon me. And I for that I was in masker
                  ••
                passed not vpon the matter, and thought verilie that all the laughinge had bine for the frier and not for me, and vpon this went sundrie times vp and downe the Bankes alwayes with that furye of hell beehinde me. And thoughe the frier (in maner) weepinge beesought me to lett him goe downe and not to showe suche shame to the weede, yet did the knaue afterward priuilie cause egges to be giuen him by certein Lackayes sett there for the nones, & makinge wise to greepe me harde for fallynge, squised them in my bosome, and many times on my head, and otherwhile in my forehead, so that I was foule arayed. Finally whan euerie man was weerye both of laughinge and throwing egges, he leaped downe from beehind me, and plucking his hoode backward showed me a great bushe of heare, and saide: M. Bernarde, I am a horse keaper in the stable at Saint Peter ad Vincula and am he that looketh to youre mulett. Then wiste I not whyche preuayled moste in me, grief, angre or shame. Yet for the lesse hurt I fled towarde my lodgynge, and the nexte mornynge I durste not showe my heade abrode. But the laughynge at that Meerie Prancke dyd not endure the daye folowynge onelye, but also lasteth (in a maner) vntill this daye. And so whan they had a whyle renewed the laughinge at rehersynge this agayn▪ 
               M. Bernarde proceaded.To feine the doinge of a matter. It is also a good and pleasant kinde of Meerie Pranckes, from whens in like maner Iestes are diriued, whan one beleaueth yt a man will do a matter which he will not in deede. As whan I was in an Eueninge after supper vppon the bridge of Leo, & goinge together with Cesar Boccadello sportinge one with an other, we beegan to take houldfast the one of the others armes, as though we wold haue wrastled, bicause then we perceyued no man about the bridge. & beeing in this maner together, there came two Frenchmen by, which seeing vs thus striuing, demaunded what the matter ment, and stayed to part vs, thinkinge we had




bine at debate in good ernest. Then said I incontinentlye: Helpe sirs, for this poore gentilman at certein times of the moone is frantike, and see now how he striueth to cast himselfe of the bridge into the riuer. Then did the two renn and layed hande vpon Cesar with me and helde him streict. And he (sayinge alwayes that I was out of my witt) struggled the more to winde himself out of their handes, and they greeped him somuch the harder. At this the people assembled to beehoulde our rufflinge together, and euerie manne rann, and the more poore Cesar layed about him with his handes and feete (for he beegane nowe to enter into coler) the more resorte of people there was, and for the greate strength he put, they beleaued verelie that he woulde haue leaped into the riuer, and therfore helde they him the streicter, so that a great thronge of people caried him to the ynn aboue grounde, all tourmoiled and without his cappe, pale for wrathe and shame that nothinge he spake coulde preuaile, partlye bicause those Frenchmen vnderstood him not, and partly bicause I also cariynge him to the ynn did alwaies bewaile the poore soules ill lucke, that was so wexed out of his witt. Now (as we haue saide) of Meerie Pranckes a man maye talke at large, but it sufficeth to repete that the places whens thei are diriued be the verie same which we haue said of Iestes.

                As for examples, we haue infinit whiche we see daylye: and emong the rest there are manye pleasant in the tales of Boccaccio, as those that Bruno and Buffalmacco played to their Calandrino, and to M. Symon: and manie other of women, which in verie deede are wittie and pretie. I remember also I haue knowen in my dayes manye that haue bine meerilie disposed in this maner, and emonge the reste a Scholar in Padoa borne in Sicilia called Pontius, which seeinge vpon a time a man of the countrey haue a coople of fatt capons, feininge himselfe to bye them, was at a point with him for the price, and bed him 
                  •
               ome wyth him to his lodginge, for beeside his price he woulde geue




him somwhat to breake his fast withall. And so brought him to a place where was a styple that stoode by himself, alone seuered from the Church, that a manne might goe rounde about him, and directlye ouer againste one of the foure sides of the styple was a lane. Here Pontius, whan he had first beethought himselfe what he had to doe, saide vnto the man of ye countrey: I haue layd these Capons on a wager with a felowe of mine, who saith that this toure compaseth xl. foote▪ and I say no, and euen as I met with thee I had bought this packthrid to measure it, therefore beefore we go to my lodging I will trie which of vs hath wonn the wager. And in so saiynge he drewe the packthrid out of his sleeue, and put the one ende of it into the man of the countreys hande, and saide: giue here, and so tooke the Capons: and with the other ende he beegane to go about the bell toure, as though he would haue measured it, making first the man of the countrey to stand still, and to houlde the packthrid directlye on the contrary side of the toure to that, that was at the head of ye lane, where assone as he came, he droue a naile into the walle, to the which he tyed the packthrid, and leauynge it so, went his wayes without anye more a do downe the lane with the Capons. The man of the Countrey stoode still a good while, alwayes lookinge whan he wolde haue done measuring. At length after he had said manie times, what do you so longe? he thought he woulde see, and founde that Pontius held not the line, but a naile that was driuen into the walle, which onlye remayned for payment of his Capons. Of this sort Pontius played manye Meerie Pranckes. And there haue bine also manie other pleasaunt men in this maner, as Gonella, Meliolo in those dayes, and now our frier Seraphin and frier Marian here and manye well knowen to you all. And in verie deede this kinde is to be praysed in men that make profession of nothinge elles. But the Meerie Pranckes that ye Courtier ought to vse, must (by myne aduyse) be somewhat wyde from immoderate




iesting. He ought also to take heed that his Meerie Prancke

And that they be not to bitter, & aboue all that he haue respect and reuerence,Reuerence to women. aswell in this, as in all other thinges, to women, and especially where the staininge of their honestie shall consist. Then the L. Gaspar, trulye, M. Bernarde (quoth he) you are to partiall to these women. And whie will you that men shoulde haue more respecte to women then women to men? Set not you asmuch by your honestie, as they do by theirs? Thinke you then that women ought to nippe men both with woordes and mockes in euery matter without any regarde, and men shoulde stande with a flea in their eare, and thanke them for it? M. Bernarde answered: I say not the contrarye, but women in their Iestes and Meerie Pranckes ought to haue the respectes to menne which we haue spoken of. Yet I say with more libertie ma
                  •
                
               
                  •
               hey touch men of smalle honestie, then men maye them. And that bicause we oure selues haue established for a lawe, that in vs wanton lief is no vice, nor default, nor anye sclaunder, and in women it is so great a reproch and shame, that the that hath once an yll name, whether the report that goith of her be true or false, hathe loste her credit for euer. Therfore sins the talkinge of womens honestie is so daungerous a matter to offende them sore, I say that we ought to touche them in other matters and refraine from this. For whan the Iest or Meerie Pranck 
               
                  •
               ippeth to sore, it goith out of ye boundes whiche we haue alreadye said is fitt for a gentilman. Here M. Bernarde makinge a litle stopp, the L. Octauian Fregoso saide smylinge: My L. Gaspar can make you an answere to this law which you alleage that we oure selues haue made,Women. that yt is not perchaunce so oute of reason, as you thynke. For sins women are moste vnperfect creatures and of litle or no woorthynesse in respect of menne, it beehoued for that




they were not apt to woorke any vertuous deede of them selues, that they should haue a bridle put vpon them with shame and feare of infamye, that shoulde (in maner) by force bring into them some good condicion. And continency was thought more necessary in them, then any other,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                to haue assuraunce of children. So that verie force hath driuen men withall inuentions, pollicies, and wayes possible to make women continent, and (in maner) graunted them in all thinges beeside to be of smalle woorthinesse, and to do the cleane contrarye alwaies to that they ought to do. Therfore sins it is lawfull for them to swarue out of the waye in all other thinges without blame, if we should touch them in those defaultes, wherin (as we haue said) they are to be borne withall, and therfore are not vnseemelye in them, and passe full litle vpon it, we shoulde neuer moue laughter. For you haue alreadye said, that Laughter is prouoked with certein thinges that are disagreeinge. Then spake the Dutchesse: Speake you (my L. Octauian) of women thus, and then complaine that they loue you not. The L. Octauian answered: I complaine not of it, but rather I thanke them for it, sins in not louinge of me, they bind not me to loue them. Neither to I speake after mine owne opinion, but I say yt ye 
               L. Gaspar might alleage these reasons. M. Bernarde said: truly women should make a good bargayne, if they coulde make attonementes with suche two greate ennemies as you and the L. Gaspar be. I am not their ennemye answered the L. Gaspar, but you are an ennemye to menne. For in case you will not haue women touched in this honesty of theirs, you ought aswell to appoynt them a lawe not to touche menne, in that whiche is asmuche shame to vs, as incontinencye to women. And why was it not as meete for Alonso Carillo to make ye answere which he gaue maistres Boadilla of ye

                sins you saye those Meerie Pranckes of women in Boccaccio are so wittie & pretie. Then said M. Bernarde smiling: My lordes, forsomuch as my part hath bin to entreat onlie of Iestes, I entende not to passe my boundes therin, & I suppose I haue already showed whie I iudge it not meete to touch women neyther in woorde nor deede about their honestie, and I haue also giuen them a rule not to nippe men where it greeueth them. But I saye that those Meerie pranckes and Iestes whiche you (my L. Gaspar) alleage, as that Alonso said vnto M. Boadilla, althoughe it somwhat touche honestie: yet doeth it not discontent me, bicause it is sett farr inoughe of, and is so priuie, that it may be simplye vnderstoode, so, that he might haue dissembled the matter, and affirmed that he spake it not to that ende. He spake an other (in mine opinion) verie vnseemlie, whiche was: Whan the Queene passed by M. Boadillas house, Alonso sawe peincted with coles all the gate ouer, suche kinde of dishonest beastes, as are peincted al out ynnes in such sundrie wise, and cumminge to the Countesse of Castagneto said vnto her: See (madam) the heades of the wielde beastes that M. Boadilla killeth euerie daye in huntinge. Marke you this, thoughe it were a wittie metaphor, and borowed of Hunters▪ that counte it a glorye to haue manie wielde beastes heades nayled at their gates, yet is it dishonest and shamefull iestinge. Beeside that, it was not in answeringe, for an answere hath muche more courtesie in it, bicause it is thought that a manne is prouoked to it, and it must needes be at a sodeine. But to retourn to our matter of the Meerie Pranckes of women,




I say not that they do well to beeguile their husbandes: but I say that some of the deceites whiche Boccaccio recyteth of women, are pretie and wittie inough, and especiallye those you haue spoken of your selfe. But in mine opinion the prancke that Richarde Minutoli wrought, doeth passe the boundes, and is muche more bitterer then ye 
               Beatrice wrought. For Richarde Minutoli tooke muche moore from Philippellos wief, then did Beatrice from Egano her husbande: bicause Richarde with that priuie pollicie enforced her, and made her to do of herself that she wolde not haue done: And Beatrice deceyued her husbande to do of herself that she lusted. Then saide the L. Gaspar: for no other cause can a manne excuse Beatrice but for loue, whiche ought to be alowed aswell in men as in women. Then answered M. Bernarde: Trulye the passions of loue bringe with them a great excuse of euerye fault, yet iudge I (for my part) that a Gentilman that is in loue, ought aswell in this point as in all other thynges, to be voide of dissimulation, and of an vpright meaninge.Loue without dissimulation. And if it be true that it is such an abhominable profit & trespace to vse tradiment against a mans verie ennemye: consider you how muche more haynous that offence is againste a person whom a man loueth.Tradiment against one beloued. And I beleaue ech honest louer susteyneth such peynes, such watchinges, hasardeth himselfe in suche daungers, droppeth so manie teares, vseth so manie meanes and wayes to please the woman whom he loueth, not cheeflye to come bye her body,The true end of louers desires. but to winn the fortresse of that minde, to breake in peeces those most harde Diamondes, to heate that colde yce, that lye manye times in the tender brestes of these women. And this do I beleaue is the true and sounde pleasure, and the ende wherto the entent of a noble courage is bent. And for my part trulye (were I in loue) I wold like it better to know assuridlye that she whom I loued and serued loued me again with hert, and had bent her minde towarde me, without receiuing any other contentation, then to enioye




her and to haue my fill of her againste her owne will, for in that case I shoulde thinke my selfe maister of a deade carcase. Therfore suche as compase their desires by the meane of these Meerie Pranckes, which maye perhappes rather be termed Tradimentes then Meerie Pranckes, do iniurye to other,Unhonest louers. and yet receyue they not for all that the contentacion which a man should wishe for in loue, possessynge the bodie without the will. The like I saye of certein other that in loue practise enchauntmentes. sorceries, and otherwhile plaine force, sometime meanes to cast them in sleepe and suche like matters.Giftes in 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                And knowe for a sooth, that gyftes also diminishe muche the pleasures of loue, bicause a man maie stand in doubt whether he be beloued or no, but that the woman maketh a countenance to loue him, to fare the better by him: therfore ye see that the loue of Ladies and great women is esteamed, bicause it appeereth that it can arrise of none other cause, but of perfect and true loue, neyther is it to be thoughte that a great Ladye wyll at anye tyme showe to beare good will to her inferiour, onlesse she loue him in verye deede. The answered the L Gaspar: I denie not that the entent, the peynes and daungers of louers ought not principally to haue their ende dyrected to the victorye rather of the minde then of the bodye of the woman beloued. But I saye that these deceytes whiche you in men terme Tradimentes, and in women Meerie prankes, are a verie good meane to come to this ende, bicause alwayes he that possesseth the bodie of women, is also maister of the mind. And if you beethinke you well, Philippellos wief after her great lamentatyon for the deceyt wrought her by Richard, knowinge howe muche more sauourye the kysses of a louer were then her husbandes, tournynge her rigour into tender affection towarde Richarde, from that daye forwarde loued hym moste deerlye. You maye perceiue nowe that his continuall hauntinge, hys presentes, and




hys so manye other tokens, whyche had bine so longe a proof of hys good will toward her, were not able to compasse that, that hys beeyinge with her a smalle while did. Nowe see this Meerie Prancke or Tradiment (howe euer you will terme it) was a good waye to wynn the fortresse of that minde. Then M. Bernarde, you (quoth he) make a surmise, which is most false, for in case women should alwayes giue their minde to him yt possesseth their body, there should be none found that wold not loue their husbandes more then anye person in the worlde beesyde, where it is seene not to be so. But Iohn Boccaccio was (as you be) with out cause an ennemye to women. The L. Gaspar answered: I am no ennemye of theirs, but (to confesse the troth) fewe menne of woorthynesse there be that generally set any store by women, although otherwhile, to serue their tourne withall, they make wise to the contrarye. Then answered M. Bernarde: You doe not onelye iniurye to women, but to all menne also that reuerence them: Notwithstandinge (as I haue saide) I will not swarue from my first pourpose of Meerie Pranckes, and vndertake suche an enterprise so harde, as is the defence of women against you, that are a valiant Champyon. Therfore I will ende this my communication, whyche perhappes hath byne lenger then needed, but oute of parauenture not so pleasaunt as you looked for. And syns I see the Ladyes so quyet and beare these iniuries at youre handes so pacyentlye as they doe, I wyll hensefurth beleaue that some parte of that which the L. Octauian hath spoken is true: Namely That they passe not to be yll reported of in euerye other matter, so theyr honesty be not touched. Then a greate parte of the women there, for that the Dutch
                  •
               sse had beckened to them so to doe: arrose vpon their feete,Orpheus was torne in peeces with women▪
                & ran all laughyng toward the L. Gaspar, as they wold haue buffeted him & done as the wood womē did to Orpheus saing cōtinually:




Now shall we see whether we passe to be yll spoken of or no. Thus partlye for laughinge, and partlye for the risinge of euerye one from his seate, yt seemed the sleepe that now beegane to enter into the eyes and heade of some of them departed, but the L. Gaspar said: See I pray you where thei haue not reason on their side, they will preuaile by plaine force, & so end the communication, geuinge vs leaue to depart wt stripes. Then answered yt 
               L. Emilia: No (ꝙ she) it shall not be so: for whan you perceyued M. Bernarde was weerie of his longe talke, you beegan to speake so muche yll of women, thinkinge you shoulde finde none to gainsaye you. But we will sett into ye field a fresher knight that shall fight with you, bicause your offence shall not be so long vnpunished. So tourninge her to the L. Iulian that hitherto had said little, she said vnto him: You are counted the protectour of the honour of women, therfore it is nowe hyghe time to showe that you come not by this name for nothinge, and in case ye haue not bine woorthelye recompensed at anye time for this profession hitherto, nowe muste you thinke that in puttinge to flight so bitter an ennemy, you shall binde all women to you muche more, and so muche, that where they shall do nothinge elles but rewarde you, yet shall the bondage still remaine freshe, and neuer cease to be recompensed. Then answered the L. Iulian: Me thinke (madam) you show great honour to your ennemy, and verie litle to youre defender: for vndoubtedlye the L. Gaspar hath said nothing against women, but it hath bine fullye answered by M. Bernarde. And I beleaue euerye one of vs knoweth, that it is meete the Courtier beare verie great reuerence to warde women, and a discreete and courtiouse person ought neuer to touch their honestie neither in boord, nor in good earnest. Therfore to dispute of this so open a trueth, were (in maner) to put a doubt in manifest matters. I thinke wel that the L. Octauian passed his boundes somwhat in sayinge that VVomen are most vnperfect creatures and not apt to woorke anye vertuous deede, and of




litle or no woorthinesse in respect of men. And bicause manie times credit is geuen to men of great authority, although they speake not the full truth, and also whan they speake in boorde, the L. Gaspar hath suffered himselfe to be lead by the L. Octauians woordes to saye that Men of wisdome sett no store by them, which is most false. For I haue knowen few men of woorthinesse at anye time that doe not loue and obserue women,Men of worthines obserue women. the vertue and consequentlye the woorthinesse of whom I deeme not a iott inferiour to mens. Yet if we should come to this contention, the cause of women were lyke to quaile greatlie, bicause these Lordes haue shaped a Courtier that is so excellent and of so manie diuine qualities, that whoso hath ye vnderstanding to consider him to be such a one as he is, will imagin that ye desertes of women can not attaine to yt point. But in case yt matter should be equally deuided, we haue first neede of so witty & eloquent a person as is Count Lewis & Sir Fridericke, to shape a gentilwoman of the Palaice with all perfections due to a woman, as they haue shaped the Courtier with the perfections beelonging to a man. And then if he that defended their cause were anie thinge wittie and eloquent, I beleaue (bicause the truth will be a helpe to him) he may plainlye showe that women are as full of vertues as men be. The Ladye Emilia answered: Nay, a great deale more, and that it is so you may see▪ vertue is the female, and vice is the male. The L. Gaspar then laughed, and tourning him to M. Nicholas Phrisio, what is your iudgement Phrisio (quoth he) Phrisio answered: I am sorie for the L. Iulian that he is so seduced with the promises and flatteringe woordes of the L. Emilia to renn into an errour to speake the thinge whiche for hys sake I am ashamed of. The L. Emilia answered smilinge: you will sure be ashamed for your owne sake, whan you shall see y• 
               L. Gaspar after he is conuicted, confesse his owne errour and yours to, and demaunde that pardon whiche we will not graunt him. Then spake the Dutchesse:




Bicause it is very late, I will we defar the wholl vntill to morow, the more for yt I thinke it well done we folow the L. Iulians counsell, that beefore we come to this disputacion we maye haue a gentilwoman of the Palaice so facioned in all perfections, as these Lordes haue facioned the perfect Courtier. Madam quoth the L. Emilia then, I pray God it fall not to oure lott to giue this enterprice to anye confederate with the L. Gaspar, least he facion vs for a gentilwoman of the Court, one that can do nought elles but looke to the kitchin and spinn. Then saide Phrisio: In deede that is an office fitt for herr. Then the Dutchesse, I haue a good hope in the L. Iulian (quoth she) who will (for the good witt and iudgement I knowe he is of) imagyn the greatest perfection that maye be wished in a woman, and in like maner expresse it well in woordes, and so shal we haue somewhat to confounde the L. Gaspars false accusations withall. Madam, answered the L. Iulian, I wote not whether youre diuise be good or no to committ into my handes an enterprise of so greate weight, for (to tell you the troth) I thinke not my selfe able inoughe. Neyther am I like the Count and Sir Fridericke, whiche with their eloquence haue shaped suche a Courtier as neuer was, nor I beleaue euer shalbe. Yet if your pleasure be so that I shall take this bourden vpon me, let it be at the least with those condicions that the other haue had before me: namely, that euerie man, where he shall thinke good, maye replye against me, and this shall I recken not ouerthuartinge but aide, and perhappes in correctynge mine erroures we shall finde the perfection of a gentilwoman of the Palaice which we seeke for. I trust, answered the Dutchesse, your talke shall be such, that litle may be saide against you. Therfore settle your minde to thynke vpon onlie this and facion vs suche a Gentilwoman that these our aduersaries maye be ashamed to say, that she is not equall with the Courtier in vertue: of whom it shall be well done Sir Friderick speake no more, for he hath but




so well sett him furth, especiallye sins we must compare a woman to him. I haue (madam) answered Sir Friderick, litle or nothinge now left to speake of ye Courtier, and ye I did thinke vpon, M. Bernardes Iestes haue made me forgete. If it be so quoth the Dutchesse, assembling together to morow beetimes, we shal haue leiser to accomplish both the one & the other. And whan she had so said, they arrose all vpon their feete, and takynge their leaue reuerentlye of the Dutchesse euerye man withdrue him to his lodging.
         
         
            
            ¶ THE THIRDE BOOKE OF the Courtier of Count Baldessar Castilio vnto. M. Alphonsus Ariosto. Englisshed at the request of the Ladye Marquesse of Northampton, in anno 1551.
            
               
                  IT is read that Pithagoras verie wittilye and after a suttill maner found out the measure of Hercules bodye, in that he knewe that the space where euerye fyue yeeres they kept the games or prices of Olympus in Achaia nigh vnto Elis beefore Iupiter Olympicus Temple,
                  Pisis ad Iouem Olimpicum.
                was measured by Hercules himselfe: and appointed a furlonge of grounde there of sixe hundreth and fiue and twentie of his owne feete: and the other furlonges whiche after his time were caste oute in diuerse partes of Greece by his successors,
                  Plin. lib. ii. cap. xxiii. de natur. histor.
                were also of sixe hundreth and fiue and twentie of their feete, but for all that somewhat shorter then his. Pythagoras knewe furthwith by that proportion how muche Hercules foote was bigger then al the other mens feete, and so the measure of his foote once knowen, he gathered ye all Hercules bodye proporcionally in greatnesse exceaded all other mens, so muche, as that furlonge, all other furlonges. You may then (gentle M. Alphonsus) by the verie same reason easlie gather by this least parte of all the rest of the bodye, how farr the Court of Vrbin excelled all the other in Italy.
               The Court of Vrbin.
                For if the sportes & pastymes (that are vsed to none other end but to refresh ye werisome mindes after earnest labours) far passed all such as are commonly vsed in ye other Courtes of Italy: What (gesse you) were all the vertuous practises, wherunto all menne had their mindes bent, & were fully & wholly addicted. And of this I may be boulde to make my vaunt, nothing mistrusting




but to be credited ther in, consideringe I goe not about to praise so auntient antiquities wherin I might, if I were disposed, feine what I lusted: but of this I speake, I am able to bringe furth manie men of woorthy credence, for sufficient triall, whiche as yet are in lief and haue themselues seene and marked well the liuinge & conuersation of such as in times past excelled in that Court. And I recken my selfe bounde (for that lyeth in me to do) to stretch furth my force with all diligence to defende this famous memorie from mortall obliuion, and with my penn to make it liue in the mindes of oure posteritie, wherby perhappes in time to come there shall not want that will enuie this our time. For there is no manne that readeth of the wonderfull families of times past, but in his mind he conceyueth a certein greater opinion of them that are written vpon, then it appeereth those bookes can expresse though they haue bine written with perfection: Euen so do we consider that all the readers of this our trauayle (if at the least wise it shall deserue so much fauour, yt it may come to ye sight of noble men & vertuous Ladies) will cast in their minde & thinke for a surety, that the Court of Vrbin hath bine muche more excellent and better fournished wt notable men, then we are able to expresse in writinge. And in case so much eloquence were in me, as there was prowesse in them, I should nede none other testimonie to make such giue full credence to my woordes, as haue not seene it.
            Whan therfore the companye was assembled in the accustomed place the day folowinge at the due hour, and set with silence, euerye man tourned his eyes to Sir Fridericke and to the L. Iulian, waytinge whan the one of them would beegine to speake his minde. Wherfore the Dutchesse, after she had bine still a while, 
                  〈◊〉
                
               L. Iulian (quoth she) euery mans desire is to see this your Gentilwoman well set furthe, and if you showe vs her not in such maner, that all her beawties maye be discerned, we will suspect that you




are ieolous ouer her▪ The L. Iulian answered: Madam, if I reckened her beawtifull, I woulde show you her without any other settingfurth,and in suche wise as Paris did beehoulde the three Goddesses.
                  Iuno.
                  Minerua.
                  Venus.
                But in case these Ladies be not a helpe to me to trim her (who can do it right well) I doubt me, that not onlye ye 
               L. Gaspar and Phrisio, but all ye other Lordes here shall haue a iust cause to speake yll of her. Therfore sins she is yet in some part deemed beawtifull, perhappes it shall be better to kepe her close and see what Sir Friderick hath yet beehind to speake of the Courtier, which (no doubt) is muche more beawtifull then my woman can be. That I had in minde, answered Sir Fridericke is not so necessary for the Courtier, but it may be left out, and no hurt done: yea, it is a contrarye matter almost to that hitherto hath bine reasoned of. And what matter is it then, quoth the Dutchesse? Sir Fridericke answered, I was pourposed, in what I coulde, to declare the causes of these companies and ordres of knightes brought vp by great Princis vnder diuerse standardes,
                  Order of S. Michael.
                  
                  Of the Garter.
                  
                  Of the Golden Flisé.
                  
                as is that of Saint Michael in the house of Fraunce, the order of the Garter vnder the title of Saint George in the house of 
                  Englande, the Golden Flice
                in the house of Burgony, & how these dignities be geuen, and in what sort thei that deserue are disgraded from them, how they first came vp, who were the founders of them, and to what ende they were ordeined, bicause we see that these knightes in great Courtes are alwayes highlye esteamed. I minded also, if time had suffised me, beside ye diuersitie of maners vsed in ye Courtes of christian Princes in feasting & appeeringe in open showes,
                  Great Turké The Sophy.
                to speake somewhat also of the great Turkes: but much more particularlye of the Sophyes kinge of Persia: for whan I vnderstood by merchaunt men a longe time trafficked in that countrey, the noble men there to be very ful of prowesse and well manered and vse in their conuersation one with an other, and in womens seruice, and in all their practisinges much courtesie and great sobrietie, and whan time serueth, in marciall feates, in sportinges,




and vndertaking enterprises much sumptuousnes, great liberality & brauerie, I delited to knowe what order they take in these thinges which they sett most store by, wherin their Pompes consist and braueries of garmentes & armour, wherin they differ from vs, and wherin we agree, what kinde of enterteinment their women vse, and with what sober mode they showe fauour to, who so is in their loue seruice: but to say the truth, it is no fitt time nowe to entre into this talke, especiallye sins there is other to be said, and much more to our pourpose then this. Yes, ꝙ the L. Gaspar, both this and many other thinges be more to the pourpose, then to facion this gentilwoman of the Palaice, forsomuche as the verie same rules that are giuen for the Courtier, serue also for the woman, for aswell ought she to haue respect to times & places and to obserue (asmuche as her weaknesse is able to beare) all the other properties that haue bin somuch reasoned vpon, as ye Courtier. And therfore in steade of this, it were not perhappes amisse to teach some particular pointes that beelong to ye seruice about a Princis person, for no doubt the Courtier ought to know them and to haue a grace in doing them. Or els to speake of the way that he ought to take in ye bodily exercises, how to ride, to handle weapon, & wrastle, and wherin consisteth the hardnes of these feates. Then spake ye Dutchesse, smiling: Princis are not serued about their persons with so excellent a Courtier as this is. As for the exercises of bodye & strength and slightnes of person, we will leaue them for M. Peter Mount here to take charge to teache them whan he shall thinke most meete, for presently the L. Iulian hath nothinge elles to speake of, but of this woman, whom (me thinke) you nowe beegine to haue a feare of, & therfore woulde brynge vs oute of oure pourpose. Phrisio answered: certein it is, that nowe it is needlesse and out of pourpose to talke of women, especially beeinge yet beehinde somwhat to be spoken of the Courtier, for ye one matter ought not to be mingled with the other. You are in a great errour, answered the L. Cesar Gonzaga, for




like as no Court, how great euer it be, can haue any sightlinesse, or brightnesse in it, or mirth without women, nor anie Courtier can be gratious, pleasant or hardye, nor at anye time vndertake any galant enterprise of Chiualrye onlesse he be stirred wyth the conuersacion and wyth the loue & contentacion of womē, euen so in like case ye Courtiers talke is most vnperfect euer more, if the entercourse of women giue them not a part of the grace wherwithall they make perfect and decke out their playing the Courtier. The L. Octauian laughed and saide: Beehoulde a peece of the bayte that bringeth men out of their wittes. Then the L. Iulian tourning him to the Dutchesse, Madam (quoth he) sins it is so youre pleasure, I will speake that commeth to minde, but with verie great doubt to satisfie. And i wisse a great deale lesse peine it were for me to facion a lady yt should deserue to be Queene of ye world, then a perfect gentilwoman of the Court, for of herr I wote not where to fett any pattern, but for a Queene I should not neede to seeke farr, and sufficient it were for me onlye to imagin the heauenly condicions of a lady whom I know, and through seeynge them, direct all my thoughtes to expresse plainlye with woordes the thynge that manye see with their eyes, and where I could do no more, yet should I fulfill my dutie in naminge her. Then said the Dutchesse: Passe not your boundes (my L. Iulian) but minde the order taken, and facion the gentilwoman of the Palaice, that this so woorthie a maistresse maye haue hym that shall woorthelie serue her. The L. Iulian proceaded: for a proof therfore (Madam) that your commaundement may driue me to assaye to do, yea the thinge I haue no skill in, I shall speake of this excellent woman, as I woulde haue her. And whan I haue facioned her after my minde, and can afterwarde gete none other,
                  Ouid. lib. xiii me

                     am:
                I will take her as mine owne, after the example of Pigmalion. And where as the L. Gaspar hath said, that the verye same rules that are giuen for the Courtier▪ serue also for the woman, I am of a contrarye




opinion. For albeit some qualities are commune and necessarye aswell for the woman as the man, yet are there some other more meeter for the woman then for the man, and some again meete for the man, that she ought in no wise to meddle withall.Wherin th
                     •
                   woman should differ from the 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                The verie same I saye of the exercises of the bodye. But principally in her facions, maners, woordes, gestures and conuersation (me thinke) the woman ought to be muche vnlike the man. For right as it is seemlye for him to showe a certein manlinesse full and steadye, so doeth it well in a woman to haue a tendernes, soft and milde, with a kinde of womanlie sweetnes in euerye gesture of herres, that in goyng, standinge and speakinge what euer she lusteth, may alwayes make her appeere a woman without anye likenes of man. Adding therfore this principle to the rules that these Lordes haue taught the Courtier, I thinke well, she maye serue her tourne with manye of them, and be endowed with verye good qualities, as the L. Gaspar saith.In what they agr
                     ••
                  . For many vertues of the minde I recken be as necessary for a woman, as for a man▪ Likewise noblenesse of birth, auoidinge Affectation or curiositie, to haue a good grace of nature in all her doinges, to be of good condicyons, wyttye, foreseeyng, not haughtie, not enuious, not yll tunged, not light, not contentious, not vntowardlye, to haue the knowleage to wynn and kepe the good wyll of her Ladye and of all others, to do well and with a good grace yt exercises comely for women.Beawtie. Me thinke well beawty is more necessarie in her then in the Courtier, for (to saye the truth) there is a great lacke in the woman that wanteth beawtie. She ought also to be more circumspect and to take better heed that she giue no occasion to be yll reported of, and so to beehaue her selfe, that she be not onlye not spotted wyth anye fault, but not so much as with suspicion. Bicause a woman hath not so manye wayes to defende her selfe from sclaunderous reportes, as hath a man. But for somuch as Count Lewis hath verye particularly expressed




the principall profession of the Courtier, and willeth it to be in Marsiall feates, me thinke also beehouffull to vttre (according to my iudgement) what the Gentilwoman
                  •
                of y• Palace ought to be: in which point whan I haue throughlye satisfied,Uertues of the minde. I shall thinke my self rid of the greatest part of my dutye. Leauing therfore a part the vertues of the minde that ought to be commune to her with the Courtier,Commune properties. as wisdome, noblenes of courage, staidenesse, and manie mo, and likewise the condicions that are meete for all women, as to be good and discreete, to haue the vnderstandinge to order her husbandes gooddes and her house and children whan she is maried, and all those partes that beelonge to a good huswief: I say that for her that liueth in Court, me thinke there beelongeth vnto her aboue all other thinges,Sweetenesse in language. a certein sweetnesse in language that may delite, wherby she may gentlie entertein all kinde of men with talke woorth the hearynge and honest, and applyed to the time and place, and to the degree of the person she communeth withall: Accompaniyng with sober and quiet maners and with the honestye that must alwayes be a stay to all her deedes,Liuelinesse of witt. a readie liuelines of wit, wherby she may declare herselfe far wide from all dulnesse: but with such a kinde of goodnes, that she may be esteamed no lesse chaste,A meane. wise and courteise, then pleasant, feat conceited & sobre: & therfore must she kepe a certein meane very hard, & (in a maner) diriued of contrarie matters, and come iust to certein limites, but not passe them. This woman ought not therfore (to make herself good and honest) be so skemish and make wise to abhorr both the companye and the talke (though somwhat of ye wantonnes

               ) if she be present,Wanton talke. to gete her thens by and by, for a man may lightlye gesse that she feined to be so coye to hide that in herselfe, whiche she doubted others might come to the knowleage of: & such nice facions are alwaies hateful. Neither ought she again (to showe herself free and pleasant) speake wordes of dishonesty,To much familiaritye. nor vse a certein familiaritye withoute




measure & bridle, and facions to make men beleaue that of her, that perhappes is not▪ but beeinge present at suche kinde of talke, she ought to geue the hearinge with a litle blushing & shamefastnes. Likewise to eschew one vice yt I haue seen reigne in many: namely,To speake and giue eare to ill report
                     •
                  s of other women. to speake & willingly to giue ear to such as report ill of other women: for suche as in hearinge the dishonest beehauiours of other women disclosed, are offended at the matter, and make wise not to credit and (in maner) to thinke it a wonder that a woman should lead an vncleane lief, they make proof y• sins this fault seemeth vnto them so foule a matter, they commit it not. But those yt go alwaies harking out ye loues of others & disclose them so point by point, and wt such ioye, it seemeth that they enuy the matter, & that their desire is to haue all men know it, that the like may not be imputed to them for a trespace, and so they tourne it to certein laughters with a kind of gesture, wherby they make men to suspect at the verie same instant that they take great contentacion at it. And of this arriseth, y• men although to their seeming they giue diligent ear to it, for ye most part conceiue an ill opinion of them and haue them in verye small reputation, and (to their weeninge) with these beehauiours are enticed to attempt them farther. And many times afterward they renn so farr at rouers, that it purchaseth them worthely an yll name, and in conclusion are so litle regarded, yt men passe not for their companie, but rather abhorr them. And contrariwise,Honest women esteamed with al men. there is no man so shameles and high minded, but beareth a great reuerence towarde them that be counted good & honest, bicause that grauitie tempered with knowleage and goodnes, is (as it were) a shield against the wanton pride and beastlines of saucy merchauntes. Wherfore it is seen that one woord, a laughter or a gesture of good will (how litle soeuer it be) of an honest woman, is more set by of euery man, then al ye toyes & wanton gestures of them that so lauishly show small shamefastnesse. And where they leade not in deede an vncleane lief, yet wyth those wanton countenaunces,

And forsomuch as wordes that are not grounded vpon some pithie foundacion, are vaine and childishe, the Gentilwoman of the Palaice, beeside her discreation to vnderstand the condicion of him she talketh withall, to entertein him honestlye, must needes haue a sight in manie thinges, and a iudgemente in her communication to pike out such as be to pourpose for the condicion of him

The L Iulian laughed and said: you can not chouse (my L. Gaspar) but still you must vttre youre yll stomake againste women. But certes me thought I had spoken sufficient, and especiallie beefore such audience, that I beleaue none here, but vnderstandeth concernynge the exercises of the body, that it is not comlye for a woman to practise feates of armes, ridinge, playinge at tenise, wrastling, and manye other thinges that beelonge to men. Then said Vnico Aretino: Emonge them of olde time the maner was that women wrastled naked with men, but we haue lost this good custome together with manye mo. The L. Cesar Gonzaga replied to this. And in my time I haue seene women playe at tenise, practise feates of armes, ride, hunt, and do (in a maner) all the exercises beeside, that a gentilman can do. The L. Iulian answered: Sins I may facion this woman after my minde, I will not onelye haue her not to practise these manlie exercises so sturdie and

And bicause the L. Gaspar doeth also aske what these manye thinges be she ought to haue a sight in, and howe to entertein, and whether the vertues ought to be applyed to this enterteinment, I saye that I will haue her to vnderstande that these Lordes haue wylled the Courtier to knowe:A iudgement in exercises not mee

that men can haue of the thinges which they practise not, and this to haue knowleage to praise and make of Gentilmen more and lesse accordinge to their desertes. And to make a breef rehersall in fewe woordes of that is alreadye saide,Qualities for a Gentilwoman. I will that this woman haue a sight in letters, in musike, in drawinge or peinctinge, and skilfull in daunsinge, and in diuising sportes and pastimes, accompaniynge with that discreete sobermode and with the giuinge a good opinion of herselfe, the other principles also that haue bine taught the Courtier. And thus in conuersation, in laughing, in sporting, in iesting, finally in euery thinge she shall be had in very great price, and shall entertein accordingly both with Iestes & feat conceites meete for her, euerie person that commeth in her company. And albeit staidnes, noblenes of courage, temperance, strēgth of the minde,Uertues. wisdome and the other vertues a man wold thinke beelonged not to entertein, yet will I haue her endowed with them all, not somuch to entertein (although notwithstanding they may serue therto also) as to be vertuous: and these vertues to make her suche a one, that she may deserue to be esteamed, and al her doinges framed by them. I wonder then, ꝙ the L▪ Gaspar smilinge, sins you giue women both letters, and staidnesse, & noblenesse of courage & temperance, ye will not haue them also to beare rule in Cities & to make lawes, & to leade armies, & men to stand spinning in ye kitchin. The L. Iulian answered in like maner smiling: Perhappes to, this were not amisse, thē he proceaded. Do you not know yt 
               Plato (which in deede was not very friendly to women) giueth them ye ouerseeing of Cities, & all other marciall offices he appointeth to men?

For to tell you the plaine trothe, I marueile you were not ashamed somuch to passe youre boundes, where it ought to haue suffised ye to make this gentilwoman of the Palaice beawtifull, sober, honest, welspoken, and to haue the vnderstandinge to entertein without renninge in sclaunder, with daunsinge, musike, sportes, laughing, Iestes, & the other matters that we see daily vsed in Court: But to go about to giue her the knowleage of all thinges in the worlde, and to appoint her the vertues that so syldome times are seene in men, yea and in them of old time, it is a matter that can neyther be held withall nor scantlye heard. Now that women are vnperfect creatures and consequently of less woorthiness then men, and not apt to conceiue those vertues that they are, I pourpose not to affirme it, bicause the prowesse of these Ladies were inough to make me a lyer. Yet this I saye vnto you, that most wise men haue left in writinge,A woman the default of nature. that nature, bicause she is alwaies set and bent to make thinges most perfect, if she coulde, woulde continuallye bring furth men, and whan a woman is borne, it is a slacknes or default of nature, and contrary to that she

But leauinge this a part, bicause you said that I should make my proof of the perfection of ech of them by the woorkes, I saye vnto you, if you consider the effectes of nature, you shall finde that she bringeth women furth as they be, not at a chaunce, but fittlye necessary for the ende. For albeit she shapeth them of bodye not stoute and of a milde minde, with manye other qualities

Therfore moothers nourish vp children & fathers instruct them, & with manlines prouide for it abrode, that they with carefull diligence store vp in the house, which is no lesse praise. In case you wil then consider the auntient Histories (albeit men at all times haue bine verie sparing in writinge the prayses of women) and them of latter dayes, ye shall finde that continually vertue hath raigned aswell emong women as men:Women haue acheued great

handicraftes, longe it were to reherse, neither is it needfull to make any rehersall therof. If then in the essentiall substance the man is no more perfect then the woman, nor yet in the Accidentes (and of this beeside reason, the experiences are seene) I wote not wherein this his perfection shoulde consist. And bicause you saide that Natures entent i
                     •
                   alwaies to bring furth thinges most perfect, & therfore if she could, would alwayes bringe furth a man, and that the bringing a woman furth is rather a default and slackenesse of nature, then her entent, I answere you that this is ful and wholly to be denied, neither can I see whie you maye saye that nature entendeth not to bringe furth women, without whom mankind can not be preserued, wherof nature herself is more desirous then of anye thinge elles, bicause through the meanes of this felowship of male & female she bringeth furth children, that restore the receiued benifites in their childhood to their fathers in their olde dayes, in that they nourishe them: afterwarde they renue them, in beegettinge th

               m selues also other children, of whom they looke in their old age to receiue it, that beeing yonge they beestowed vppon their fathers: wherby nature (as it were) tourning her about in a circle, fulfilleth an euerlastingnesse, and in this wise geueth an immortalitie to mortall men. Sins then to this, the woman is as needefull as the man, I can not discern for what cause the one is made by happ more then the other. Truth it is that Nature entendeth alwaies to bringe furth matters most perfect, & therfore meaneth to bring furth man in his kinde, but not more male then female. Yea were it so that she alwayes brought furth male, then shoulde it withoute perauenture be an vnperfectnesse: for like as of the bodye and of the soule there arriseth a compounde more nobler then his partes, whiche is, man: Euen so of the felowshippe of male and female there arriseth a compounde preseruinge mankinde, without which the partes were in decaye, & therfore male and female by nature are alwaies together, neither can the one be wtout the other: Right so he ought not to be called ye male, that

And for somuch as one kinde alone betokeneth an imperfection, the diuines of olde time referr both the one and the other to God: Wherfore Orpheus said that Iupiter was both male and female: And it is read in Scripture that God facioned male and female to his likenes
                     •
                  . And the Poetes manie times speaking of the Goddes, meddle the kindes together. Then the L. Gaspar, I woulde not (quoth he) we should entre into these subtill pointes, for these women will not vnderstande vs. And albeit I answere you with verie good reasons, yet will they beleaue, or at the leaste make wise to beleaue that I am in the wrong, and furthwt will geue sentence as they lust. Yet sins we are entred into them, only this will I saye, that (as you know, it is the opinion of most wise men) the man is likened to the Fourme,

                     •
                  ? And contrariwise the man hateth the woman that hath bine the first to coople in that wise with him? and addinge therto the cause, affirmeth it to be this: For that in this act the woman receyueth of the man perfection, and the man of the woman imperfection: and therfore euerie man naturallye loueth the thinge that maketh him perfect, and hateth that maketh him vnperfect. And beeside this a great argument of ye perfection of the man, and of the imperfection of the woman, is, that generallye euerye woman wisheth she were a man, by a certein prouocation of nature, that teacheth her to wishe for her perfection. The L. Iulian answered sodeinlye: The seelie poore creatures wish not to be a man to make them more perfect, but to haue libertye, and to be ridd of the rule that




men haue of their owne authoritie chalenged ouer them. And the similitude which you giue of the Mattier & Fourme, is not alike in euerye point: bicause the woman is not made so perfect by the man, as is the Mattier by the Fourme for the Mattier receiueth his beeinge of the Fourme, and can not stande without it: yea the more Mattier Fourmes haue, the more imperfection they haue withall, & seuered from it, are most perfect: but the woman receiueth not her beeinge of the man, yea as she is made perfect by the man, so doeth she also make him perfect: wherby both the one and the other come together to beegete children: the whyche thinge they can not do any of them by them selues. The cause then of the continuall loue of the woman towarde the first that she hath bine with, and of the hatred of the man towarde the first woman, I will not affirme to be that youre Philosopher alleageth in his Problemes, but I impute it to the surenesse and stablenesse of the woman, and waueringe of the man, and that not without naturall reason: for sins the male is naturallye hott, by that qualitie he taketh lightnesse, stirring and vnstedfastnes, and contrariwise the woman throughe colde, quietnesse, steadie waightinesse, and more earnest imprintinges. Then the L. Emilia tourninge her to the L▪ Iulian, for loue of god (quoth she) come once out of these your Mattiers and Fourmes and males and females, and speake so that you maye be vnderstoode: for we haue heard and very well vnderstoode the ill that the L.

Gaspar alleageth against you shoulde be seene vnanswered to. I wote not, my L. Iulian, quoth then the L.

Will you still, answered the L. Iulian, entre into subtill pointes? you shall perceiue your self at euerye time to come into a greater pecke of troubles: & that it is so, herken to. I graunt you, ye heat in it self is more perfect then colde,Heate. but this foloweth not in meddled matters & compounded, for in case it were so, the body that were most hot should be most perfect: whiche is false, bicause temperate bodies be most perfect. I do you to weete moreouer,Women cold of complexion. that ye woman is of complexion colde in cōparason of ye man: which for ouermuch heat is far wide from temper: but as touching herself, she is temperate, or at ye least neerer to temper then the man,why the woman is more temperat then the man. bicause she hath that moisture within her of equall portion wt the natural heat, which in ye man through ouermuch drouth doth sooner melt & consume away. She hath also suche a kinde of colde that it resisteth & comforteth the naturall heate, and maketh it neerer to temper, & in the man ouermuch heat doth soone bring ye natural warmth to the last degree, the which wanting nourishment,Men so

But I pourpose not now to tell you, how much in dignitie all creatures of mankinde be inferiour to the virgin our Lady, for meddlinge holye matters with these our fonde reasoninges: Nor reherse howe manye women with infinite stedfastnes haue suffred cruell death vnder Tirannes for the name of Christ: nor them yt with learninge in disputacion haue confuted so manye Idolatrers. And in case you will answere me, that this was a miracle and the grace of the holy ghost, I say vnto you that no vertue deserueth more praise, then that which is approued by the testimonie of god. Manye other also of whom there is no talke, you your self maye looke vpon, especially in readinge Saint Hierom, which setteth out certein of his time with such wonderfull prayses,

And what displeasure, quoth the L. Iulian, can women doe their husbandes, that is so without remedy, as those are which husbandes do their wiues? which though not for loue, yet




for feare are obedient to their husbandes. Sure it is in deede, quoth the L.

               and, who had to name Synattus. It happened that an other Gentilman of greater authoritie then Synattus, and (in a maner) heade ruler and Tirann of the Citie where they dwelled, fell in loue with this yonge woman: and after he had longe attempted by all wayes and meanes to compasse her, and all but loste labour, beethinkinge himselfe that the loue she bore her husbande, was the onlye cause that withstood his desires, he caused this Synattus to be slayne. Thus instant vpon her afterwarde continuallye, other frute coulde he neuer gete of her, then what he had beefore. Wherfore this loue daily encreasinge, he was fullye resolued to take her to wief, for all in degree she was muche inferiour to him. So suite beeinge made to her friendes by Sinoris (for so was the louer named) they tooke in hande to perswade her to be contented wyth it: Declaring that to agree therto, was verye profitable, and to refuse it, perilous for her and them all. She after she had a while gainsaied them, at length made answere that she




was contented. Her kinsfolke brought this tidinges to Sinoris, which passing measure glad, gaue order to haue this mariage made out of hande. After they were then both come for this pourpose solemnlye into the Temple of Diana, Camma had caused to be brought to her a certein sweet drinke whiche she had made, and so beefore the image of Diana in the presence of Sinoris she dranke the one moitie. Afterwarde, with her owne hand (for this was the vsage in mariages) she gaue the remaine to ye bridegrome, whiche dranke it cleane vp. Camma assone as she sawe her deuice take effect, kneeled her downe verye ioyfull before the image of Diana, and said: Oh Goddesse, thou that knowest the bottome of my hert, be a good witnesse to me, howe hardlye after my deere husbande deceased, I haue refreined from killinge my selfe, and what peines I haue susteined to endure the greef to liue in this bitter lief, in whiche I haue felt none other ioye or pleasure, but ye hope of the reuenge whiche I perceyue nowe is come to effect. Therfore wyth gladnesse and contentation I go to finde out the sweete companye of that soule, whiche in lyef and death I haue alwayes more loued then mine owne selfe. And thou Caytif, that weeneddest to haue bine my husbande, in steade of a mariage bed, giue ordre to prepare thee a graue, for of thee do I here make a sacrifice to the shadowe of Synattus. Synoris amased at these woordes, and alreadye feelynge the operation of the poyson within him that put him to great peine, proued many remedies, but all preuayled not. And Camma had fortune so fauourable on her side, or what euer els, that beefore she died, she had knowleage that Sinoris was deade. Whan she hearde of that, with verye great contentation she layed her vpon her bed, with her eyes to heauen, continuallye callynge vpon the name of Synattus, and saying. Oh most sweete mate, sins nowe I haue bestowed for the




last tokens vpon thy death, both teares and reuenge, and perceiue not that I haue anye thinge yet beehinde to doe for thee here, I flee the world and this without thee a cruell lief, which for thy sake onlye in times past was deere to me. Come therefore and meete me (oh my Lorde) and embrace as willinglie this soule, as she willinglye commeth to thee. And speakinge these woordes, and with her armes spred, as thoughe she woulde at that instant haue embraced him, died. Say nowe Phrisio, what thinke you by this?

And where the renoume of that Ladye in euerie place and with all Nations is verye great, they that liued with her and were present at all her doinges, do all affirme this renoume to be spronge of her vertue and desertes. And whoso will waye her actes, shall soone perceiue the truth to be so. For leauinge apart infinite thinges that make triall of this, and might be toulde, if it were our pourpose, euerye man knoweth yt in the first beginninge of her reigne, she founde the greatest part of Castilia possessed by great Astates: Yet recouered she the wholl again, so iustly and in such sort that they dispossessed themselues continued in a great good affection, and were willing to make surrender of that they had in possession. It is also a most knowen thinge with what courage and wisedome she alwaies defended her realmes from most puissant ennemies.

for great courtesy and honestie to couer some offence that by mishappe or ouermuch loue a woman is renn into. And thus you may see that I am more on womens side, where reason beareth me oute, then you be. I denie not that men haue taken a litle libertie, and that bicause they know by the commune opinion, that to them wanton liuing is not so sclaunderous as to women, which through the weakenes of their kinde, are muche more enclined to appetites, then men: and in case they absteine otherwhile from satisfiynge their lustes, they doe it for shame, not that will is not moste readye in them, and therfore haue men layed vppon them feare of sclaunder for a bridle, to keepe them (in a maner) whether they will or no in this vertue, without the whiche (to saye the trothe) they were litle to be set bye: for the world hath no profit by women, but for gettinge of children.

                the whiche (sins you will so haue it) I will not dispute, how women coulde do, yt sufficeth they do it not. And whan it was meete for men to make triall of their continencie, aswell howe they passed women in this vertue, as in the rest, althoughe you graunt it not. And about this, will not I reherse vnto you so many Histories or fables, as you haue done, I remit you to the continencie onlie of two most mightie personages, youthfull and vpon their victorye, whiche is wont to make haute men of lowest degree. And the one is, the great Alexander toward the most beawtiful women of Darius his ennemie and discomfited. The other, Scipio, vnto whom beeinge XXIIII yeeres of age, and hauinge wonn by force a Citie in Spaine, there was brought a most beawtiful and noble Damisell taken emonge manye other. And whan Scipio vnderstoode that she was affiansed to be a Lorde of the Countrey, he did not only absteine from all dishonest act towarde her, but vndefiled restored her to her husband and a large gift withall. I coulde tell you of Xenocrates,

                coulde (in which matters she was verie well practised) she had neuer the pour to make him once showe the least signe of wantonnesse, for all she bestowed a wholl night about it. And of Pericles that did no more but heare one prayse with ouermuche earnestnesse the well fauourednesse of a boye,
                  Pericles reprehended Sophocles for sayinge O puerum pulchrum.
                and he tooke him vp sharplye for it. And of manye other most continent of their owne free wil, and not for shame or feare of punishment, that compelleth the greatest part of women to kepe them selues vpright in this vertue, whiche notwithstandinge deserue much praise withall: and whoso falselye bringeth vp of them a sclaunderous report of vncleannesse of lyuinge, is worthie (as you haue said) very sore punishmēt. Then spake the L. Cesar whiche had helde his peace a good while: Iudge you in what sort the L. Gaspar speaketh in the dispraise of women, whan these are the matters that he speaketh in their praise. But if the L. Iulian will giue me leaue, that I maye in his steade answere him certein few matters, as touchinge where (in mine opinion) he hath falselye spoken against women, it shall be good for him & me bothe. For he shall rest him a while, & shall afterward the better go forwarde to speake of some other perfection of the Gentilwoman of the Palaice, and I shall haue a good tourne that I haue occasion to execute iointlye with him this dutie of a good knight, whiche is to defende the truth. Mary I beseche ye, answered the L. Iulian: for me thinke I haue alreadye fulfilled accordinge to my poure, that I ought, and this communication nowe is out of the pourpose that I went about. The L Cesar then beegane: I will not nowe speake of the profit that the worlde hath by women beeside the bearinge of children, for it is well inoughe declared howe necessarye they be, not onlye to oure beeinge, but also to oure well beeinge. But I saye (my L Gaspar) that in case they be as you affirme more inclined




to appetites, then men, and notwithstandinge absteine more then men (which you your selfe graunt) they are so much ye more woorthie praise, as their kinde is lesse able to withstande naturall appetites. And if you saye they do it for shame, I can not see but for one vertue you giue them two.Shame. For in case shame can doe more in them then appetite, and throughe it refraine from yll doynge, I esteame this shame (which in conclusion is nothinge els but feare of sclaunder) a moste sildome vertue and reigninge in verie fewe menne. And if I coulde without infinite reproche to menne, tell howe manye of them be drowned in vnshamefastnesse and impudencye (whiche is the vice contrarie to this vertue) I shoulde infect these deuoute eares that heare me. And for moste part these kinde of iniurious persons both to god and nature, are menne wel stricken in yeeres,Iniurious persons to God and nature. which professe some preesthoode, some Philosophye, some diuinitie, and rule Commune weales with suche Catoes grauitie in countenance, that it maketh an outwarde showe of all the honestye in the worlde, and alwaies alleage woman kinde to be most incontinent, where they at no time finde them selues more agreeued, then at the want of their naturall lustynesse, yt they may satisfie their abominable desires, whiche still abide in the minde after nature hath taken them from their bodye, and therfore manye times finde oute wayes, where force preueyleth not. But I will not tell farther. It fuffyceth for my pourpose ye graunt ye women absteine more from vncleane liuinge, then menne. And sure it is, that they are not kept short with any other bridle, then what they put vpon them selues. And that it is true, the moste part of them that be kept vnder with ouerstreict looking to, or beaten of their husbandes or fathers, are lesse chaste, then they that haue some libertye. But generallye a greate bridle to women, is the zeale of true vertue and the desire of good name, whyche manye that I haue knowen in my dayes more esteame,Zeale of true vertue and good report.



               
then their owne lief. And in case you wil tell the troth, euerie one of vs hath seene most noble yonge menne, discreete, wise, of prowes & welfauoured spend, many yeeres in louinge, sparinge for nothinge that might entice, tokens, suites, teares: to be short, whatsoeuer may be imagined, and all but lost labour. And if it might not be tould me that my condicions neuer deserued I shoulde be beloued, I woulde alleage my self for a witnesse, which more then once throughe the vnchaungeable and ouerstedfaste honestie of a woman was nighe deathes doore. The L. Gaspar answered: marueile you not therat for women that are suid to, alwayes refuse to fulfill his request that suith to them, but those that are not suid to, sue to others. The L. Cesar said: I neuer knewe them that haue bine suid to by women, but manye there be that perceiuinge they haue attempted in vaine and spent their time fondlye, renn to this noble reuenge, and saye that they had plentie of the thinge whiche they did but caste in their minde.Sclaunderous persons of womens honesties. And to their weeninge, to report yll and to studye for inuentions how to bringe vp sclaunderous tales of some woorthie gentilwoman, is a kinde of Courtiers. But these kinde of persons that knauishelye make their vaunt of anye woman of price, be it true or false, deserue very sore correction & punishment. And if it be otherwhile bestowed vpon them, it can not be saide howe muche they are to be commended that do this office. For in case they tell lyes, what mischiefe can be greater then to take from a woorthy woman with guile the thinge which she more esteameth then her lief? And no other cause, but ye ought to make her renowmed with infinite prayses. If again, it be true they say, what peine can suffice so trayterous a person, that rendreth suche ingratitude in recompence to a Gentilwoman, whiche wonne with his false flattringes, feigned teares, continuall suites, bewaylinges, craftes, deceites, and periuries hath suffred her selfe to be lead to loue ouermuche, afterward without respect,




hath giuen herselfe vnheedfullie for a praye to so wycked a spirit? But to answere you beeside to this wonderfull continencye of Alexander & Scipio which you haue alleaged, I saye, that I will not denie but eche of them did a deede woorthie much praise. Notwithstandinge least ye should saye that in rehersinge to you auntient matters, I toulde you fables, I will alleage a woman of oure time of base degree,An example of true continencye. who notwithstanding showed a farr greater continency then anye of these two great astates. I say vnto you therfore y•. I knewe once a welfauoured and tender yonge woman, whose name I tell you not, for giuynge matter to manye leude persons to report yll, whiche assone as they vnderstande a woman to be in loue, make an yll descantinge vpon it. She therfore beloued of a woorthie and faire condicioned yonge Gentilman, was bent with hert and minde to loue him. And of this not I alone, vnto whom of her owne accord she vttered trustfullye the wholl matter, no otherwise then if I had bine, I will not say a brother, but an inward sister of herres, but all that beehelde herr in companye of the beloued yonge m an, were well weettinge of her passion. She thus feruentlye louinge, as a most louing minde coulde loue, continued two yeeres in suche contynencie, that she neuer made anye token to this yonge man of the loue that she bore him, but suche as she coulde not hide from him. At no time she woulde speake with him, nor receiue any letters from him or tokens, where there neuer passed daye but she was tempted with both the one and the other. And howe she longed for it, that wote I well, for yf otherwhile she coulde priuilie gete anye thinge that had bine the yonge mans, she was so tender ouer it, that a manne woulde haue thought that of it had spronge her lief and all her ioye. Yet woulde she neuer in so long a time content him with other, then to beehoulde him and be seene of him again, & somtime happening to be at open feastes, daunce with him as she did with others. And bicause




there was no great difference in their degree, she and the yonge man coueted that so great a loue might haue a luckye ende, and be man and wief together. All the men and women in the Citie desired the same, sauinge her cruell father, which of a weywarde and straunge opinion minded to beestowe her vpon an other more welthie. And this was not by the vnluckye mayden otherwise gainstoode, then with most bitter teares. And after this vnfortunate mariage was cōcluded with great compassion of the people there, and despaire of the poore louers, yet did not this stroke of fortune serue to roote vp so grounded a loue in the hert of ech other, but lasted afterwarde the terme of three yeeres, albeit she full wiselye dissembled it, & sought euerye waye to cutt in sunder those desires, whiche now were past hope. And in this while she folowed on still in her set pourpose of continencye, and perceiuinge she could not honestly haue him, whom she worshipped in ye world, she chose not to haue him at all, and continued in her wont not to accept messages, tokens nor yet his lookes. And in this resolued determination the seelie soule vanquished with moste cruell affliction, and wexed through longe passion verie feint, at the three yeeres ende, died. Rather woulde she forgoo her contentacions and pleasures so much longed for, finally her lief, then her honestie. And yet wanted she no meanes nor wayes to fulfill her desire most secretlye, and without perill either of sclaunder or anye other losse. And for all that, refrained she from the thinge of herselfe that she so muche coueted, and for the whiche she was so continuallye attempted by the person whom alone in the world her desire was to please. And to this was she not driuen for feare or anye other respect, but onlye for the zeale of true vertue. What will you say of an other?An other example of a mayden. yt for sixe monthes almost nightlye laye with a moste deere louer of herres, yet in a gardein full of most sauoury fruites, tempted with her owne most feruent longinge and with the petitions and teares




of him that was moore deere to herr then her owne selfe, refrayned from tastinge of them. And for all she was wrapped and tyed in the streict chaine of those beloued armes, yet neuer yelded she herselfe as vanquished, but preserued vndefiled the floure of her honestie. Trowe you not (my L. Gaspar) that these be deedes of continency

                alike to Alexanders? Whiche most feruentlye inamored not with the women of Darius, but with this renowme and greatnesse, that pricked him forwarde with the spurres of glorye to abide peines and daungers to make himself immortall, set at nought not onelie other thinges, but hys owne lief, to gete a name aboue all men? and do we marueile with suche thoughtes in his hert that he refrayned from a thinge whiche he coueted not greatlye? for sins he neuer sawe those women beefore, it is not possible that he shoulde be in loue with them at a blushe, but rather perhappes abhorred them for Darius his ennemies sake. And in this case euerie wanton act of his towarde them, had bine an iniurye and not loue. And therfore no great matter if Alexander, whiche no lesse with noblenes of courage then marciall prowesse subdued the world, abstained from doing iniury to women. The continency in like case of Scipio is doubtlesse much to be commēded,
                  Scipio.
                yet if ye consider wel, not to be compared to these two womens: for he in like maner also refrayned from a thing that he coueted not, beeinge in his ennemies countrey, a fresh Capitain, in the beeginning of a most weightie enterprise, leauing beehind him in his Countrie such expecta

from a light & hurtfull appetite, in showing continency & a freeherted welmeaning, y• which (as it is written) gote him all the hartes of that people: and an other armie stood him in steade with fauour to vanquish mens hertes, whiche perhappes by force of armes had bine inuincible.

                So that this maye rather be termed a warlike pollicie, then pure continencie: Albeit beeside, ye report of this matter is not all of ye purest, for some writers of authoritie affirme that this Damsell was enioyed of Scipio in the pleasures of loue: and of this I tell you ye maye depose vpon. Phrisio said: Perhappes ye haue founde it in the Gospell. I haue seene it my self, answered the L. Cesar, and therfore I haue a much more certeintye of this,

Here then for all hard matters are founde out remedies, counterfeit kayes, laders of ropes, wayes to cast into sleepe, a trifling matter is peincted out, examples are alleaged of others that do much woorse: so that euery matter is made so easy, that she hath no more trouble, but to say, I am content. And in case the poore soule maketh resistaunce but a while, they plye her with suche prouocations, and finde suche meanes, that with continuall beatynge at, they breake in sunder that is a lett to her. And many there be that perceiuing they can not preuaile with faire woordes, fall to threatninges, & say that they wil tel their husbandes they are, that they be not.

Other seeke by inchauntmentes, and witchcraftes to take from them the liberty that god hath graunted to soules, wherin are seene wonderfull conclusions.

Therefore thys needed no disputacyon (my L, Gaspar) or at the least so manye woordes in the matter. But you in gainsaiynge the truth haue hindred the vnderstandinge of a thousande other




pretie matters and necessary for the perfection of the gentilwoman of the Palaice. The L. Gaspar answered: I beleaue there can no more be said. Yet if you suppose that the L. Iulian hath not garnished her throughlye with good condicions, the fault is not in him, but in him that hath so wrought that there are no

Iulian answered: In good sooth (Madam) me seemeth I haue sufficientlye spoken. And for my part I am well pleased wyth this my woman. And in case these Lordes will not haue her as she is, let them leaue her to me. Here whan all was whilt, Sir Fridericke saide: My L. Iulian, to giue you occasion to saye somewhat elles, I will but aske you a question,Enterteinment. as touchynge that you haue willed to be the principall profession of the Gentilwoman of the Palayce. And this it is, that I longe to knowe howe she shoulde beehaue herselfe in a point that (to my seemynge) is moste necessarye. For albeit the excellent qualityes whiche you haue geuen her conteine in them discretion, knowleage, iudgemente, sleight, sobermoode, and so manye other vertues, wherebye of reason she ought to haue the vnderstandynge to entertein euerye manne and in all kinde of pourpose, yet thinke I notwithstandynge aboue any other thing that it is requisite for her to knowe what beelongeth to communication of loue.To tal
                     •
                  e of loue. For euen as euerye honest Gentilmanne for an instrument to obteine the good will of women, practyseth those noble exercises, precise facions and good maners whyche we haue named, euen so to this pourpose applyeth he also hys woordes, and not onlye whan he is stirred thereto by some passion, but often times also to do honour to the woman he talketh withall, seemynge to him that to declare to loue her is a witnes that




she is woorthie of it, and that her beawtie and woorthynesse is suche, that it enforceth euerie manne to serue her. Therfore woulde I knowe, howe this woman in suche a case shoulde beehaue herselfe vprightlye, and howe to answere him that loueth her in deed, and how him that maketh false semblant: and whether she ought to dissemble the vnderstandinge of it, or be answerable, or shonn the matter, and howe to handle herselfe. Then said the L. Iulian: It were first needefull to teach her to knowe them that make semblant to loue, and them that loue in deede: Afterward for beeinge answerable in loue or no, I beeleaue she ought not to be guided by any other mans will, but by her owne self. Sir Fridericke saide: Teach you her then what are the moste certein and surest tokens to descerne false loue from true, and what triall she shal thinke sufficient to content herselfe withall, to be out of doubt of the loue shewed her. The L. Iulian answered smiling: That wote not I, bicause men be nowadayes so craftye, that they make infinite false semblantes, and sometime weepe, whan they haue in deede a greater lust to laughe. Therefore they shoulde be sent to the constant Ile vnder the Arch of faithfull louers. But least this woman of mine (which is my charge and no mans elles, bicause she is my creature) should renn into those erroures whiche I haue seene manye other renn into, I would saye that she should not be light of credence that she is beloued: nor be like vnto some, that not onlie make not wise they vnderstande him not that communeth with them of loue, be it neuer so farr of, but also at the first woorde accept all the prayses that be giuen them: or elles denie them after such a sort, that it is rather an alluringe for them to loue them they commune withall, then a withdrawinge of themselues. Therfore the maner of enterteinment in reasoninge of loue that I will haue my woman of the Palaice to vse, shall be alwaies to shonn beeleauinge that whoso talketh of loue, loueth her anye whitt the more. And in




case the Gentilman be (as manye suche there are abrode) malapert, and hath smalle respect to her in his talke, she shall shape him such an answere, that he shall plainly vnderstande she is not pleased withall. Again, if he be demure and vseth sober facions and woordes of loue couertlie, in suche honest maner, as I beeleaue the Courtier whom these Lordes haue facioned will doe, the woman shall make wise not to vnderstand him, and shal draw his woordes to another sense, seekinge alwaies sobrely with the discretion and wisdome that is alreadye said becommeth her, to stray from that pourpose. But in case the communication be such that she can not feigne not to vnderstande it, she shall take the wholl (as it were) for a meerie diuise, and make wise that she knoweth it is spoken to her rather to honour her withall, then that it is so in deede, debasinge her desertes and acknowleginge at the Gentilmans courtesie the prayses which he geueth her: & in this sort she shall be counted discreete, and shall be on the surer hande for beeinge deceiued. Thus me seemeth the Gentilwoman of the Palaice ought to behaue herself in communication of loue. Then Sir Friderick, You debate this matter, my L. Iulian (quoth he) as though it were requisite, that all suche as speake with women of loue, shoulde tell lyes, and seeke to deceiue them, the whiche in case it were so, I woulde say your lessons were good. But if this gentilman that enterteineth, loueth in very deede, and feeleth the passion that so tourmenteth mens hertes sometime, consider you not in what peine, in what calamitie and death ye put him in, whan at no time you will that the woman shall beeleaue him in any thinge he saith about this pourpose? Shall othes, teares, and so many other tokens then, haue no force at all? Take heede (my L. Iulian) least a manne may thinke that beeside the naturall crueltye whiche manie of these women haue in them, you teach them get more. The L. Iulian answered: I haue spoken, not of him that loueth, but of him that enterteineth




with communication of loue, wherein one of the necessariest pointes is, that woordes be neuer to seeke: and true louers as they haue a burninge hart, so haue they a colde tunge, with broken talke and sodeine silence. Therfore (may happ) it were no false principle to saye: He that loueth much, speaketh litle. Howbeit in this I beleaue there can be giuē no certein rule, by reason of ye diuersity of mens maners. And I wote not what I should say, but yt ye woman be good & heedfull, and alwaies beare in mynde, that men may with a great deale lesse daunger declare themselues to loue, then women. The L. Gaspar said laughinge: Why (my L. Iulian) wil not you that this your so excellent a woman shall loue again, at the least whan she knoweth cer

               heefly the homage and reuerence, wherwithal louers obey and (in a maner) woorship the vertue of the women beloued. In this, answered the L. Iulian, I will not counsel her. But I say pardee to loue, as you now vnderstand, I iudge it not meete, but for vnmaried women. For whā this loue can not ende in matrimonye, the woman muste needes haue alwaies the remorse and pricking that is had of vn

               asement for so harde a scourge? and giue vnto an other that which her husbande not onelye regardeth not, but rather cleane abhorreth? I houlde well, that suche as haue meete husbandes and be beloued of them, ought not to do them iniurie: but the other in not louinge him that loueth them do them selues iniurie. Nay, they do themselues iniurie in louinge other beeside their husbande, answered the L Iulian. Yet sins not louing is not many times in our will, if this mishap chaunce to the woman of the Palaice, that ye hatred of her husbande or ye loue of an other bendeth her to loue, I will haue her to graunt her louer nothing elles but ye minde: nor at any time to make him any certein token of loue, neither in woorde nor gesture, nor any other way that he may be fully assured of it. Then saide M. Robert of Bari smilinge, I appeale (my L. Iulian) from this iudgement of youres, and I beleaue I shall haue many felowes. But sins you will teach this currishnesse (that I maye terme it so) to maried women, will ye also haue the vnmaried to be so cruell and discourtious? and not please their louers at the least in somewhat? In case my woman of the Palaice, answered the L. Iulian, be not maryed, myndinge to loue,How maidēs shoulde loue▪
                I wyll haue her to loue one, whom she maye marye,




neyther will I thinke it an offence if she showe him some token of loue. In which matter I will teache her one generall rule in fewe woordes, and that is, That she showe him whom she loueth all tokens of loue,

               but such as may bring into the louers minde a hope to obtein of her any dishonest matter. And to this she must haue a great respect, bicause it is an errour that infinit women renn into, which ordinarilye couett nothinge somuch as to be beawtifull: and bicause to haue manye louers they suppose is a testimonye of their beawtie, they do their best to winn them as many as they can. Therfore often times they renn at rouers in beehauiours of small modestie, and leauinge the temperate sobermoode that is so sightlye in them, vse certein wanton countenaunces, with baudie woordes and gestures full of vnshamefastnesse, houldinge opinion that menne marke them and giue care to them willyngly for it, & with these facions make themselues beloued, which is false: bicause the signes and tokens that be made them, sprynge of an appetite moued by an opinion of easinesse, not of loue. Therfore will not I that my woman of the Palaice with dishonest beehauiours should appeere as though she wold offre herselfe vnto whoso wyll haue her, and allure what she can the eyes and affection of who so beehouldeth her: but with her desertes and vertuous condicions, with amiablenesse and grace driue into the mind of whoso seeth her the verye loue that is due vnto euery thinge woorthy to be beloued: and the respect that alwaies taketh awaye hope from whoso mindeth anye dishonest matter. He then that shall be beloued of such a woman,The loue of honest women. ought of reason to houlde himselfe contented with euerye litle token, and more to esteame a looke of herres with affection of loue, then to be altogether maister of an other. And to such a woman I wote not what to ad more, but that she be beloued of so excellent a Courtier, as these Lordes haue facioned, and she likewise to loue him, that both the one and the other may haue ful and wholy his perfection.




After the L. Iulian had thus spoken he helde his peace, whan the L. Gaspar laughinge, now (quoth he) you can not complaine that the L. Iulian hath not facioned this woman of the Palaice most excellent. And if perdee there be any suche to be found, I say yt she deserueth well to be esteamed equall with the Courtier. The L. Emilia answered: I will at all times be bounde to finde her, whan you finde the Courtier. M. Robert said then: Doubtlesse it can not be saide nay, but the L. Iulians woman whiche he hath facioned is most perfect. Yet in these her last properties as touching loue, me seemeth not withstanding that he hath made her somwhat ouer crabbed, & especially where he will haue her in woordes, gestures and countenance to take cleane away all hope from the louer, & settle him as nigh as she can in despaire. For (as all menne know) the desires of man stretch not to suche kinde of matters, whereof there is no hope to be had. And althoughe at times some women there haue bine, that perhappes bearing themselues loftie of their beawtie and woorthinesse: the first woorde they haue said to them that communed with them of loue hath bine, that they should neuer looke to come bye anye thinge of them that liked them: yet in countenance, and daliance together they haue afterward bine more fauourable to them, so that with their gentle deedes they haue tempred in part their proude woordes. But if this woman both in woordes, deedes and beehauiours take hope quite awaye, I beeleaue our Courtier, if he be wise, will neuer loue her, and so shall she haue this imperfection, yt she shall be without a louer. Then the L. Iulian, I wyll not (quoth he) haue my woman of the Palaice to take away the hope of euery thinge,Honest loue. but of dishonest matters, y• which, in case the Courtier be so courteious and discreete, as these Lordes haue facioned him, he will not onelye not hope for, but not once motion. For if beawtie, maners, witt, goodnesse, knowleage, sobermoode, and so manye




other vertuous condicions which we haue giuen the woman, be the cause of the Courtiers loue towarde her, the ende also of this loue must needes be vertuous: and if noblenesse of birth, skilfulnes in marciall feates, in letters, in musike, gentlenesse, beeing bath in speach & in beehauiour indowed with so many graces, be y• meanes wherwithall the Courtier compaseth the womans loue, ye end of that loue must needes be of the same condicion that the meanes are by the whiche he commeth to it. Beeside that,Sundrye kindeso

                   beawtye. as there be in the world sundrie kindes of beawtye, so are there also sundrie desires of men: and therfore it is seene that manie, perceiuinge a woman of so graue a beawtie that goinge, standinge, iestinge, dalyinge, and doinge what she lusteth, so tempreth al her gestures, that it driueth a certein reuerence into whoso behouldeth her, are agast and a ferde to serue her: and rather drawn with hope, loue those garishe and enticefull women, so del

               cate and tender, that in their woordes, gestures and countenance declare a certein passion somewhat feeble, that promiseth to be easely brought and tourned into loue. Some to be sure from deceytes, loue certein other so lauishe both of their eyes, woordes and gestures, that they do what euer first commeth to minde, with a certein plainesse that bideth not their thoughtes. There want not also manye other noble courages, that seeminge to them that vertue consisteth about hard matters (for it is ouer sweete a victorie to ouercome that seemeth to an other impringable) are soone bent to loue the beawties of those women, that in their eyes, woordes and gestures declare a more churlish grauitie then the rest for a triall yt their prowesse can enforce an obstinate minde, and bende also stubborne willes & rebelles against loue, to loue. Therfore suche as haue so great affiance in themselues, bicause they recken themselues sure from deceit, loue also willinglye certein women, that with a sharpenesse of wit, & with art it seemeth in their beawtie that they hide a thousande craftes.




Or elles some other, that haue accompanied with beawty a certein skornefull facion in few wordes, litle laughing, after a sort as though (in a maner) they smallye regarded whoso euer beehouldeth or serueth them. Again there are founde certein other, that vouchesafe not to loue but women that in their countenaunce, in their speach and in all their gestures haue about them all hansomnesse, all faire condicions, all knowleage, and all graces heaped together, like one floure made of all the excellencies in the worlde. Therfore in case my woman of the Palaice haue scarsitie of these loues proceadinge of an yll hope, she shal not for this be without a louer: bicause she shal not want them yt shalbe prouoked through her desertes and through the affiance of ye prowesse in themselues, wherby they shal knowe themselues worthy to be beloued of her.

               ill spake against him, but the Dutchesse to aide him that he was in the wronge, confirminge the L. Iulians opinion: after that she added: We haue no cause to complaine of the L. Iulian, for doubtlesse I thinke that the woman of the Palaice whom he hath facioned, maye be compared to the Courtier, and that with some auauntage: for he hath taught her to loue which these Lordes haue not done their Courtier. Then spake Vnico Aretino: It is meete to teache women to loue, bicause I neuer sawe anye that coulde doe it, for almoste continuallye all of them accompanye their beawtye with crueltye and vnkindnesse toward suche as serue them most faithfullye,Beawtifull women cruell. and whiche for noblenesse of birth, honestie and vertue deserued a rewarde for theyr good will: & yet manye times geue themselues for a prey to most blockish and cowardly men & verye assheades, and which not only loue them not, but abhor thē. Therfore to shon these so foule ouersightes, perhappes it had bin well done first to haue taught them to make a choise of him yt should deserue to be beloued, and afterward to loue him. The whiche is not necessarye in men, for they knowe it




to well of themselues: and I my selfe can be a good witnesse of it, bicause loue was neuer taught me, but by the diuine beawty and most diuine maners of a Lady, so that it was not in my will not to woorshippe her: and therfore needed I therin no art nor teacher at all. And I beleaue that the like happeneth to as manie as loue truly. Therfore the Courtier hath more neede to be taught to make him beloued then to loue. Then said the L Emilia: Do you now reason of this then, M. Vnico. Vnico answered: Me thinke reason woulde that the good will of women shoulde be gotten in seruinge and pleasinge them. But it, wherin they recken themselues serued and pleased, I beleaue muste be learned of women themselues, whiche oftentimes couett suche straunge matters, that there is no man yt would imagin them, & otherwhile they themselues wote not what they should longe for: therfore it were good you (Madam) that are a woman, & of right ought to know what pleaseth women, shoulde take thys peine, to do the worlde so great a profit. Then saide the L. Emilia: For somuch as you are generallye most acceptable to women, it is a good likelihoode that you knowe al the waies how their good will is to be gotten. Therfore is it pardee meete for you to teach it. Madam, answered Vnico, I can giue a louer no profitabler aduise then to procure that you beare no stroke with y• woman whose good will he seeketh. For the smalle qualities which yet seemed to the world sometime to be in me, with as faithfull a loue as euer was, were not of suche force to make me beloued, as you to make me be hated. Then answered the L. Emilia: God saue me (M. Vnico) for once thinking and much more for workinge anye thinge yt should make you be hated. For beeside that I should doe that I ought not, I shoulde be thought of a sclender iudgement to attempt a matter vnpossible. But sins ye prouoke me in this sort to speake of that pleaseth women, I will speake of it, and if it displease you, laye the fault in your selfe. I




iudge therfore, that whoso entendeth to be beloued, ought to loue and to be louely:Howe to obtein the good will of women and these two pointes are inough to obtein the good will of women. Nowe to answere to that which you lay to my charge, I say that euerie manne knoweth and seeth that you are moste louelie. Mary whether ye loue so faithfullye, as you saye ye do, I am verye doubtfull and perhappes others to. For, your beeing ouer louely, hath bine ye cause yt you haue bine beloued of many women: and great riuers diuided into manye armes beecome smalle brookes: so loue likewise scattered into mo then one bodye hath smalle force. But these your continuall complaintes and accusinge of the women whom you haue serued of vnkindenesse (which is not likely, consideringe so manye desertes of yours) is a certein kind of discretion, to cloke the fauours, contentations and pleasures whyche you haue receiued in loue, and an assurance for the women that loue you and that haue giuen themselues for a prey to you, that you will not disclose them. And therfore are they also wel pleased, yt you should thus openlye showe false loues to others, to cloke their true. Wherfore if haplye those women that you nowe make wise to loue, are not so light of beleaf, as you would they were, it happeneth bicause this your art in loue beeginneth to be discouered, and not bicause I make you to be hated. Then said M. Vnico: I entende not to attempt to confute your wordes, bicause me seemeth it is aswell my destiny not to be beleaued in truth, as it is yours to be beleaued in vntruth. Saye hardlye M. Vnico, answered the L. Emilia, that you loue not so, as you woulde haue beleaued ye did. For if you did loue,The lawe of loue. all your desires should be to please the woman beloued, and to will the selfe same thinge that she willeth, for this is the lawe of loue. But your complaininge somuche of her, beetokeneth some deceite (as I haue said) or els it is a signe that you will that, that she willeth not. Nay (quoth M. Vnico) there is no doubt but I will that, that she willeth, which is a signe I




loue her: but it greeueth me bicause she willeth not tha
                  •
               , that I will, which is a token she loueth not me, according to the verse same lawe that you haue alleaged. The L. Emilia answered: He that taketh in hande to loue, muste please and applye himself full and wholy to the appetites of the wight beloued, and accordinge to them frame hys owne: and make his owne desires, seruauntes: and hys verye soule, like an obedient handmaiden: nor at anye tyme to thynke vpon other, but to chaunge his, if it were possible, into the beloued wightes, & recken this his cheef ioy and happinesse, for so do they that loue trulye. My cheef happinesse were iumpe, answered M. Vnico, if one will alone ruled her soule and myne both. It lieth in you to do it, answered the L. Emilia. Then spake M. Bernarde interruptinge them: Doubtlesse, who so loueth trulye, directeth all his thaughtes, without other mens teachinge, to serue and please the woman beloued. But bicause these seruices of loue are not otherwhile well knowen, I beleaue that beeside louinge and seruinge, it is necessary also to make some other showe of this loue, so manifest, that the woman may not dissemble to know that she is beloued: yet with such modesty, yt it may not appeere that he beareth her litle reuerence. And therfore you (Madam) that haue beegone to declare howe the soule of the louer ought to be an obedient handmayden to the beloued, teach vs withall, I besech you, this secrete matter, which me thinke is most needefull. The L. Cesar laughed and said: If the louer be so bashfull, that he is ashamed to tell it her, let him write it her. To this the L. Emilia said: Nay, if he be so discreete, as is meete, beefore he maketh the woman to vnderstand it, he ought to be out of doubt to offende her. Then saide the L. Gaspar: All women haue a delite to be suide to in loue, althoughe they were mynded to denye the suite. The L. Iulian said, you are muche deceyued. For I woulde not counsell the Cour

to haue a repulse. What shoulde he then do? quoth the L. Gaspar. The L. Iulian answered:Howe a ma
                     •
                   should disclose his loue to a woman. In case you will needes write or speake to her, do it with such sobermoode, and so warilye, that the woordes maye firste attempt the minde, and so doubtfullye touch her entent and will, that they maye leaue her a way and a certein issue to feine the vnderstandinge that those woordes conteine loue: to the entent if he finde anye daunger, he maye draw backe and make wise to haue spoken or written it to an other ende, to enioye these familiar cherishinges and daliances with assuraunce, that oftentimes women showe to suche as shoulde take them for frendshippe, afterwarde denye them assone as they perceyue they are taken for tokens of loue. Wherefore suche as be to rashe and venture so sau
                  •
               ilie with certein furies and plunges, oftentimes lose them, and woorthilie: for it dispeaseth alwaies euery honest gentilwoman, to be litle regarded of whoso without respect seeketh for loue at her beefore he hath serued her. Therfore (in my minde) the way which ye Courtier ought to take, to make his loue knowen to ye woman me thinke should be to declare them in signes and tokens more then in woordes. For assuredlye there is otherwhile a greater affection of loue perceyued in a sigh, in a respect, in a feare, then in a thousande woordes. Afterwarde, to make the eyes the trustye messangers, that maye carye the ambassades of the hart: bicause they oftentimes declare with a more force what passion there is inwardlye, then can the tunge, or letters, or messages, so that they not onlye disclose the thaughtes, but also manye tymes kendle loue in the hert of the person beloued. For those liuely spirites that issue out at ye eyes, bicause they are engendred nigh the hart, entring in like case into the eyes that they are leueled at, like a shaft to the pricke, naturallye perce to the hart, as to their restynge place and there are at truste with those other spirites: and with the moste subtill and fine nature of bloode whyche they




carie with them, infect the bloode about the hart, where they are come to, and warme it: & make it like vnto themselues, and apt to receiue the imprintinge of the image which they haue caried away with them. Wherfore by litle and litle comminge and goinge the waye through the eyes to the hart, and bringinge backe with them the tunder and strikinge yron of beawtie & grace, these messangers kendle with the puffinge of desire the fire that so burneth,

                  he
                     •
                  pes. and neuer ceaseth consuminge, for alwayes they bringe some matter of hope to nourishe it. Therfore it may full well be said, that The eyes are a guide in loue, especiallye if they haue a good grace & sweetenesse in them, blacke, of a cleere and sightlye blackenesse, or elles gray, meery and laughinge, and so comely and percinge in beehouldinge, as some, in which a man thinketh verilie that the wayes that giue an issue to the spirites are so deepe, that by them he maye see as farr as the hart. The eyes therefore lye lurkinge like souldiers in warre lyinge in wayte in bushment, and if the fourme of all the bodye be welfauoured and of good proportion, it draweth vnto it and allureth whoso beehouldeth it a farr of, vntil he come nigh: and assoone as he is at hande, the eyes shoote, and like sorcerers, beewitch, and especiallie whan by a right line they sende their glisteringe beames into ye eies of the wight beloued at the time whan they do the like, bicause the spirites meete together, and in that sweete encounter the one taketh the others nature and qualitye: as it is seene in a sore eye, that beehoulding steadily a sound one, giueth him his disease. Therfore me thinke oure Courtier may in this wise open a great percel of the loue to his woman. Truth it is that in case the eyes be not gouerned with art, they discouer manie times the amorous desires more vnto whom a man woulde least: for through them (in a maner) visibly shinefurth those burninge passions, whiche the louer mindinge to disclose onlie to the wight beloued, openeth them manie times also




also vnto whom he woulde most soonest hide them from. Therfore he that hath not lost the bridle of reason, handleth himselfe heedefullye, and obserueth the times & places: and whan it needeth, refrayneth from so stedfast beehouldinge, for all it be a most sauourie foode,Open loue. bicause An open loue is to harde a matter. Count Lewis answered: Yet otherwhile to be open it hurteth not: bicause in this case manye times men suppose that those loues tende not to the ende which euerie louer coueteth, whan they see there is litle heede taken to hide them, and passe not whether they be knowen or no: and therfore with denial
                  •
                a man chalengeth him a certein libertye to talke openly and to stande without susspition with the wight beloued: Whiche is not so in them that seke to be secrete, bicause it appeereth that they stande in hope of, and are nighe some great rewarde, whiche they woulde not haue other men to knowe. I haue also seene a most feruent loue springe in the hart of a woman towarde one, that seemed at the firste not to beare him the least affection in the world, onlye for that she heard say, that the opinion of many was, that they loued together. And the cause of this (I beleaue) was, that so generall a iudgement seemed a sufficiente witnesse, that he was woorthie of her loue. And it seemed (in a maner) that report brought the ambassade on the louers beehalfe muche more truer and worthier to be beleauen, then he himselfe coulde haue done with letters, or woordes, or any other person for him: therfore sometime this commune voice not onlye hurteth not, but far

               hereth a mans purpose. The L. Iulian answered: Loues that haue report for their messanger, are verye perilous to make a man pointed to with a finger. And therfore who euer entendeth to walke this race warilye, needes must he make countenaunce to haue a great deale lesse fire in his stomake, then in deede he hath, and content himselfe with that, that he thinketh a trifle, and dissemble his desires,

with mouth whan the hart weepeth, and showe himself lauishe of that he is most couetous of▪ and these thinges are so harde to be done, that (in a maner) they are vnpossible. Therfore if oure Courtier would folowe my counsell, I would exhort him to kepe his loues secrete. Then said M. Bernarde: yo

                must then teach 
                  〈◊〉
                him, & me thinke it is muche to pourpose: for beeside priuie signes that some make otherwhile so closely, that (in a maner) without anye gesture, the person whom they couett, in their countenance and eyes reade what they haue in the hert, I haue sometime heard betweene two louers a long and a large discourse of loue, wherof yet ye standers by could not plainlye vnderstand any particuler point, nor be out of doubt that it was of loue, suche was the discreation & heedefulnesse of the talker: for without makinge anie maner showe that they were not willinge to be hearde, they rounded priuilye the wordes onlie that were most to pourpose, & al the rest they spake aloude, which might be applied to diuers meaninges. Then spake Sir Friderick: to reason thus in peecemeale of these rules of secretnesse, were a takinge of an infinit matter in hand: therfore would I yt we spake somwhat rather how the louer shoulde keepe and maintein his Ladies good wil, which me thinke is muche more necessary. The L. Iulian answered: I beleaue the meanes that serue him to compasse it, serue him also to kepe it, & all this consisteth in pleasinge the woman beloued,To maintein good will. without offending her at any time. Therfore it were a hard matter to giue any certein rule, bicause whoso is not discrete, infinit wayes committeth ouersightes, whiche otherwhile seeme matters of nothing, and yet offende they much the womans minde. And this happeneth more then to others, to suche as be mastred with passion: as some that whenso euer they haue opportunitie to speake with the woman they loue, lament and beewaile so bitterlye, and couett manye times thinges so vnpossible, that through this vnreasonablenesse




they are lothed of them. Other, if they be pricked with anye ieolosie, stomake the matter so greeuouslye, that without stopp they burst oute in raylinge vpon him they suspect, and otherwhile it is without trespace eyther of him or yet of the woman, and will not haue her speake with him, nor once tourne her eyes on that side where he is. And with these facions manye tymes, they do not onlye offende the woman, but also they are the cause that she bendeth herselfe to loue him. Bicause the feare that a louer declareth to haue otherwhile least his Ladye forsake him for the other, beetokeneth that he acknowleageth himself inferiour in desertes and prowesse to the other, and with this opinion the woman is moued to loue him. And perceyuinge that to put him out of fauour he reporteth all of him, although it be true, yet she beleaueth it not, and notwythstandinge loueth him the more. Then saide the L. Cesar: I confesse that I am not so wise that I coulde refrayne speakynge yll of my felow louer, except you coulde teache me some other better waye to dispatche him. The L. Iulian answered smilinge: It is saide in a Prouerbe,An Italian prouerbe. 
               VVhan a mans ennemye is in the vvater vppe to the middle, lette him reache him his hande, and helpe him from daunger: but whan he is vp to the chinn, set his foote on his head and drowne him out of hand.

For in times past I haue knowen some that in writings and speaking to women vsed euermore the woordes of Poliphilus, and ruffled so in their subtill pointes of Rhetoricke,Men that professe to be to louinge in woordes. that the women were oute of conceit with their owne selues, and reckened themselues most ignoraunt, and an houre seemed a thousand yeere to them, to ende that talke and to be rid of them. Other, bragg and boast to by yonde all measure. Other speake thinges manie times that redounde to the blame and damage of themselues, as some that I am wont to laughe at, which make profession to be louers, & otherwhile saye in the companye of women: I neuer founde woman that euer loued me,

Other, to purchase hatred to some felowe louer of theirs, are so fonde that in like maner in the companye of women they saye: Such a one is the luckiest man in the worlde, for once, he is neyther welfauoured, nor sober, nor of prowess, neyther can he do or say more then other menne, and yet all women loue him▪ and ren

Cesar Gonzaga answered: nor yet an other that a Gentilman of reputation vsed in my dayes, who shal be namelesse for the honour of men. The Dutchesse answered: tell vs at the least what he did. The L.

And after he had seene her and communed with her, as long as they thought meete and had time and leyser therto, at his leaue takinge with many bitter teares & sighes in witnesse of ye extreme greef he felt for this departinge, he required her to be alwaies mindfull of him. And afterward he added withall, That she woulde discharge his ynn, for sins he came thither at her request. he thought me

Then tourned the L. Gaspar to the L. Cesar and said: Better it had bine to haue omitted the rehersal of this matter for the honour of women, then the naming of him for the honour of men. For you may well imagin what a iudgement that great Ladie had in louinge so vnreasonable a creature. And perhappes to, of manye that serued her, she chose him for the most discreatest, leauinge beehinde, and showinge ill wil vnto them that he was not woorthie to wayte vpon. Count Lewi

And if you will tell the truth, perhappes it hath bine your chaunce to commit mo then one. The L. Cesar answered smilinge: Of good felowshippe let vs not discouer oure owne ouersightes. Yet




we must discouer them, answered the L. Gaspar, that we maye knowe how to amende them, then he proceaded. Now that the Courtier knoweth how to wynn and kepe the good will of his Lady, and take it from his felow louer, you (my L. Iulian) are dettour to teache her to kepe her loues secrete. The L. Iulian answered: Me thinke I haue sufficientlye spoken, therefore gete ye nowe an other to talke of this secreate matter. Then M. Bernarde and all the rest beegane a freshe to be in hande with him instantlye, and the L. Iulian said: you will tempt me. Ye are all the sort of you to great Clearkes in loue. Yet if ye desire to know farther, goe and reade Ouid. And howe, quoth M. Bernarde, shal I hope that his lessons are any thing worth in loue, whan he counselleth & saith that it is verye good for a man in the companye of his maistresse To feigne the dronkarde? See what a goodly way it is to gete good will withall. And he alleageth for a pretie diuise to make a woman vnderstande that he is in loue with her, beeinge at a banckett, To diepe his finger in wine and write it vpon the table. The L.

For the signes that the louer himselfe maketh, giue a farr greater susspition, then those that he maketh by them yt go in message betwene. And forsomuch as men naturallye are greedie to vnderstand, assone as a




straunger beeginneth to suspect the matter, he so applieth it, that he commeth to ye knowleage of the truth, & whan he once knoweth it, he passeth not for disclosinge it, yea sometime he hath a delite to do it. Which happeneth not of a friend, who beeside yt he is a helpe to him with fauour & counsell, doeth many times remedie yt ouersightes committed by the blinde louer, & alwaies procureth secretnes. & preueteth many matters which he himself can not foresee: beeside the great comfort yt he feeleth, whan he maye vttre his passions and greeffes, to a harty friende, & the partening of them likewise encreaseth his cōtentations. Then said the L Gaspar: there is an other cause that discouereth loues much more then this. What is that, answered the L. Iulian. The L. Gaspar said: Uaine greedinesse ioigned with the fondenesse and cruelty of women,What discloseth loue. which (as you your selfe haue saide) procure as muche as they can to gete them a great numbre of louers, and (if it were possible) they would haue them al to burne and make asshes, & after death to retourn to lief, to die again. And thoughe they loue withall, yet reioice they at the tourment of louers, bicause they suppose yt greef, afflictions and the calling euery hour for death, is a true witnesse that they are beloued, and that with their beawtie they can make men miserable & happy, and giue them life and death, as pleaseth them. Wherfore they feede vpon this only foode, and are so gredie ouer it; yt for wanting it they neuer throughly contet louers, nor yet put them out of hope, but to kepe them still in afflictions and in desire, they vse a certein lofty sowernesse of threatninges mingled with hope, and wold haue them to esteame a woorde, a countenance or a beck of theirs for a cheef blisse. And to make men count them chaste and honest aswel others as their louers, they finde meanes that these sharpe & discourtious maners of theirs may be in open sight, for euery mā to thinke yt they will much woorse handle ye vnwoorthy, sins they handle them so, that deserue to be beloued.

often times they lye nightlie with most vile men & whom they scase knowe. So that to reioice at the calamitie and continuall complaintes of some woorthie gentilman, and beloued of them, they barr themselues from those pleasures, whiche perhappes with some excuse they might come bye, and are the cause that the poore louer by verye debating of the matter is driuen to vse wayes, by the which ye thinge commeth to light, that with all diligence shoulde haue line kept most secrete. Certein other there are, whiche if with deceite they can bringe manye in beeleaf that they are beloued of them, nourish emonge them ieolosies with cherishinge and makinge of the one in the others presence. And whan they see that he also whom they loue best is now assured and oute of doubt that he is beloued through the signes and tokens that be made him, manie times with doubtfull woordes and feigned disdeignes they put him in an vncerteintie and nippe him at the verie hart, makinge wise not to passe for him and to giue themselues full and wholye to the other. Wherupon arrise malice, enimities, and infinite occasions of stryfe and vttre confusion. For needes must a man showe in that case ye extreme passion which he fealeth, althoughe it redounde to the blame and sclaunder of ye woman. Other, not satisfied with this onlye tourment of ieolosye, after ye louer hath declared all his tokens of loue & faithfull seruice, and they receyued the same with some signe to be answerable in good will, without pourpose & whan it is least looked for, they beegine to beethinke themselues, and make wise to beleaue that he is slacked, and feininge newe suspitions that they are not beloued, they make a countenaunce that they will in any wise put him out of their fauour. Wherfore throughe these inconueniences the poore soule is constrayned of verye force to beegine a freshe, and to make her signes, as thoughe he beegane his seruice but then, and all the daye longe passe by and downe through the streete, and whan the woman




goith furth of her doores to accompanye her to Churche & to euerie place where she goith, and neuer to tourne hys eyes to other place. And here he retourneth to weepinge, to sighes, to heauie countenance, and whan he can talke with her, to swearing, to blaspheminge, to desperation, & to all rages which vnhappie louers are lead to by these wielde beastes, that haue greater thirst of blood then the verie Tygres. Such sorowfull tokens as these be are to often sene and knowen, and manie times more of others then of the causer of them, & thus are they in fewe dayes so published, that a stepp can not be made, nor the leaste signe that is, but it is noted with a thousande eyes. It happeneth then, that longe before there be any pleasures of loue beetwext them, they are ghessed and iudged of all the world. For whan they see yet their louer nowe nighe deathes doore, cleane vanquished with the crueltye and tourmentes they put him to, determineth aduisedlye and in good ernest to draw backe, then beegine they to make signe that they loue him hartely, and do him al pleasures and giue themselues to him, leaste if that feruent desire should feint in him, the frute of loue shoulde withall be the lesse acceptable to him, & he ken them the lesse thanke for doinge all thinges contrarily. And in case this loue be already knowē abrode, at this same time are al ye effectes knowen in like maner abrode, that come of it, and so lose they their reputation, & the louer findeth that he hath lost time and labour and shortned his life in afflictions without any frute or pleasure, bicause he came by his desires, not whan they should haue bine so acceptable to him that they woulde haue made him a most happie creature, but whan he set litle or nothinge by them. For his hart was nowe so mortified with those bitter passions, that he had no more sense to taste ye delite or contentation offred him. Then said the L. Octtauian smilinge: you helde your peace a while and refrayned from speakinge yll of women, but now ye haue so wel hit them home, yt it appered ye waited




a time to plucke vppe your strength, like them that retire backeward to giue a greater pushe at the encounter. And to say the truth, it is ill done of you, for nowe me thinke ye may haue done and be pacified. The L. Emilia laughed, and tourninge her to the Dutchesse she said: See Madam, 
                  •
               ure ennemies begine to breake and to square one wyth an other. Giue me not this name answered the L. Octauian, for I am not your aduersarie, but this contention hath displeased me, not bicause I am sorye to see the victory vpon womens side, but bicause it hath lead the L. Gaspar to reuile them more then he ought, and the L. Iulian. & the L. Cesar to praise them perhappes somwhat more then due: beeside that through the length of the talke we haue lost the vnderstandinge of manye other pretye matters that are yet beehinde to be said of the Courtier. See, ꝙ the L. Emilia, whether you be not oure aduersarie, for the talke that is past greeueth you, and you would not that this so excellent a Gentilwoman of the Palaice had bine facioned: not for that you haue any more to say of the Courtier (for these lordes haue spoken already what they know and I beleaue neither you, ne any man elles can ad ought therto) but for the malice you beare to the honour of women. It is out of doubt, answered the L. Octauian, beeside that is alreadie spoken, of the Courtier, I coulde wishe muche more in him. But sins euery man is pleased that he shall be as he is, I am well pleased to, and woulde not haue him altered in anye point, sauinge in makinge him somwhat more frindlye to women, then the L. Gaspar is, yet not perhappes, so much as some of these other Lordes are. Then spake the Dutchesse: In any case we must see whether youre witt be suche that it can giue the Courtier a greater perfection, then these Lordes haue alreadye done: therefore dispose your selfe to vttre that you haue in your minde, els will we thinke that you also can not ad vnto him more then hath alreadie bine saide, but that you minded to diminish the praises and worthinesse




of the gentilwoman of the Palaice, seeing ye iudge she is equall with ye Courtier, whom by this meane you would haue beleaued might be muche more perfect, then these Lordes haue facioned him. The L. Octauian laughed and said: The prayses and disprayses giuen women more then due, haue so filled the eares and minde of the hearers, that they haue left no voide rowme for anye thinge elles to stande in: beeside that (in mine opinion) it is very late. Then said the Dutchesse: if we tarie till to morowe, we shall haue the more time, and the prayses and dispraises, whiche (you saye) are giuen women on both sides passinge measure, in ye meane season will be cleane out of these Lordes mindes, and so shall they be apte to conceyue the truth that you will tell vs. Whan the Dutchesse had thus spoken, she arrose vpon her feete, and courteisly dismissing them all, withdrew her to her bedchamber, and euerye manne gote him to his rest.

                  THINKINGE TO VVRITE OVTE the communication that was had the fourth night after the other mentioned in the former bookes, I feele emong sundry discourses a bitter thought that gripeth me in my minde, and maketh me to call to remembraunce worldlie miseries and our deceitfull hopes, and how fortune many times in the verie middes of our race, otherwhile nighe the ende disapointeth our fraile & vaine pourposes, sometime drowneth them beefore they can once come to haue a sight of the hauen a farr of. It causeth me therfore to remember that not long after these reasoninges were had, cruell death bereued our house of three moste rare gentilmen, whan in their prosperous age and forwardnesse of honour they most florished,

                and of them the first was the Lord Gaspar Pallauicin, who assaulted with a sharpe disease, and more then once brought to the last cast, although his minde was of suche courage yt for a time in spite of death he kept the soule and bodye together, yet did he ende hys naturall course longe beefore he came to his ripe age. A very great losse not in our house onlie and to his friendes and kinsfolke, but to his Countrie and to all Lumbardye. Not longe after died the L. Cesar Gonzaga,
               
                  L. Cesar Gonzaga.
                which to all that were acquainted with him left a bitter and sorowfull remembraunce of his death. For sins nature so sildome times bringeth furth such kinde of men, as she doeth, meete it seemed that she shoulde not so soone haue bereued vs of him. For vndoubtedlye a man maye saye that the L. Cesar was taken from vs euen at the very time whā



               
he beegane to show more then a hope of himself, and to be esteamed as his excellent qualities deserued. For with manye vertuous actes he alreadie gaue a good testimony of his worthinesse, and beeside his noblenesse of birth, he excelled also in the ornament of letters, of marciall prowesse, and of euerye woorthie qualitie. So that for his goodnesse, witt, nature, and knowleage, there was nothinge so highe, that might not haue bine hoped for at his handes. Within a short while after,
                  M. Robert of Bari.
                the death of M. Robert of Bari was also a great heauinesse to the wholl house: for reason seemed to perswade euerie man to take heuily the death of a yonge man of good beehauiour, pleasaunt and moste rare in the beawtie of fisnamye and in the makinge of his person, with as lucky and liuely towardnes, as a man coulde haue wished. These men therfore, had they liued, I beleaue would haue come to that passe, that vnto whoso had knowen them, they woulde haue showed a manifest proof, how much the Court of Vrbin was worthie to be commended, and howe fournished it was with noble knightes, the whiche (in a maner) all the rest haue done that were brought vp in it. For trulye there neuer issued out of the ho

For as you knowe Sir Fridericke Fregoso was made archebishop of Salerno, Count Lewis, Bishoppe of Baious. The L. Octauian Fregoso, Duke of Genua, M. Bernarde Bibiena, Cardinal of Santa Maria in Portico, M. Peter Bembo, Secretarye to Pope Leo. The L. Iulian was exalted to the Dukedome of Nemours & to the great astate he is presentlye in. The Lord Francescomaria della Rouere
                Generall of Roome, he was also made Duke of Vrbin: although a muche more praise may be giuen to the house where he was brought vp, that in it he hath proued so rare and excellent a Lorde in all vertuous qualities (as a man may beehoulde) then that he atteined vnto the Dukedome of Vrbin: and no smalle cause thereof




(I thinke) was the noble company wherin daily conuersation he alwaies hearde and sawe commendable nourtour. Therfore (me thinke) whether it be by happe, or throughe the fauour of the sterres, the same cause that so longe a time hath graunted vnto Vrbin verie good gouernours, doth still continue & bringeth furth ye like effectes. And therefore it is to be hoped y• prosperous fortune will still encrease these so vertuous doinges, that the happines of the house and of the State shall not only not diminish, but rather dailye encrease: And therof we see alreadye manye euident tokens, emonge whiche (I r
                  •
               cken) ye cheeffest to be, that the heauen hath graunted suche a Lady as is the Ladye Eleonor Gonzaga the newe Dutchesse. For if euer there were coopled in one bodye alone,

                knowleage, witt, grace, beawtie, sober conuersation, gentilnesse and euery other honest qualitie, in her they are so lincked together, that there is made therof a chaine, whiche frameth & setteth furth euerie gesture of herres with al these condicions together. Let vs therfore proceade in our reasoninges vpon ye Courtier, with hope that after vs there shall not want suche as shall take notable and woorthye examples of vertue at the presente Court of Vrbin, as we nowe do at the former. It was thought therefore (as the L, Gaspar Pallauicin was wont to reherse) that the next daye after the reasoninges conteined in the laste booke, the L. Octauian was not muche seene: for manye deemed that he had gotten himself out of comapnye to thinke well vpon that he had to saye withoute trouble. Therfore whan the companye was assembled at the accustomed houre where the Dutchesse was, they made the L, Octauian to be diligentlye sought for, whiche in a good while appered not, so that manye of the Gentilmen and Damselles of the Court fell to daunsynge and to minde other pastymes, supposynge for that night they shoulde haue no more talke of the Courtier. And nowe were they all settled about one thinge or an other, whan the L. Octauian came in (almost) no more looked for: and beehouldinge the L. Cesar Gonzaga and the L. Gaspar daunsinge, after he had made his reuerence to the Dutchesse, he saide smilinge: I had well hoped we shoulde haue hearde the L. Gaspar speake some ill of women this night to, but sins I see him daūce




with one, I imagin he is agreede with all. And I am glad that the controuersie, or (to terme it better) the reasoninge of the Courtier is thus ended. Not ended, I warrant you, answered the Dutchesse, for I am not suche an ennemye to men, as you be to women, and therfore I wil not haue the Courtier bereued from his due honour and the fournimentes whiche you youre selfe promised him yester night. And whan she had thus spoken, she commaunded them all after that daunse was ended to place themselues after the wonted maner, the which was done. And as they stoode all wyth heedfull expectation, the L. Octauian said: Madam, sins for that I wished manye other good qualities in the Courtier, it foloweth by promise that I muste entreate vppon them, I am well willinge to vttre my minde: not with opinion that I can speake all that may be said in the matter, but only so much as shall suffice to roote that oute of your mind, which yester night was obiected to me: namely, that I spake it more to withdrawe the prayses from ye Gentilwoman of the Palaice, in doinge you falselye to beleaue that other excellent qualities might be added to the Courtier, and with that pollicie prefarre him beefore her, then for that it is so in deede. Therfore to frame my selfe also to the houre, which is later then it was wont to be whan we beegane our reasoninges at other times, I will be breef. Thus continuinge in the talke that these Lordes haue ministred, whiche I full and wholye alowe and confirme, I say, that of thinges which we call good,Thinges good. some there be that simply and of themselues are alwaies good, as temperance, valiant courage, helth, & al vertues that bring quietnesse to mens mindes. Other be good for diuerse respectes & for the ende they be applied vnto, as ye lawes, liberality, riches & other like. I thinke therfore yt ye Courtier (if he be of ye perfectiō y• Count Lewis & Sir Friderick haue described him) maye in deede be a good thinge & woorthie praise, but for all that not simplye, nor of himself, but for respect of the ende wherto he may be applied.




For doubtlesse if ye Courtier with his noblenesse of birth, comlie beehauiour, pleasantnesse and practise in so many exercises, should bringe furth no other frute, but to be suche a one for himself, I woulde not thinke to come by this perfect trade of Courtiership, that a man shoulde of reason beestowe so much studye and peynes about it, as who so will compase it must do. But I woulde say rather that manie of the qualities appointed him, as daunsing, singinge and sportinge, were lightnesse and vanitie, and in a a man of estimation rather to be dispraised then commended: bicause those precise facions, the settinge furth ones selfe, meerie talke and such other matters belonginge to enterteinment of women and loue (althoughe perhappes manie other be of a contrary opinion) do many times nothinge elles but womannish the mindes, corrupt youth, and bring them to a most wanton trade of liuinge:Dastardlinesse. wherupon afterwarde ensue these effectes, that the name of Italy is brought into sclaunder, and few there be that haue the courage, I will not saye to

               eoparde their lief, but to entre once into a daunger. And without perauenture there be infinite other thinges, that if a man beestow his labour and studie about them, woulde bring furth muche more profit both in peace and warr, then this trade of Courtiershipp of it self alone. But in case the Courtiers doinges be directed to the good ende they ought to be and whiche I meane: me thinke then they should not onlye not be hurtfull or vaine,The ende of a Courtier. but most profitable & deserue infinit praise. The ende therfore of a perfect Courtier (wherof hitherto nothinge hath bine spoken) I beleaue is to purchase him, by the meane of ye qualities whiche these Lordes haue giuen him, in such wise the good will and fauour of the Prince he is in seruice withall, that he may breake his minde to him, and alwaies enfourme hym francklye of the trueth of euerie matter meete for him to vnderstande, without feare or perill to displease him.

As yt is written that Cimon was yll spoken of bicause he loued wine, Scipio, sleepe, Lucullus, bancketinges. But wolde God, the Princis of these oure times wolde coople their vices wyth so manie vertues as did they of olde time: which yf they were out of the way in any point, yet refused they not the exhortations and lessons of such as they deemed meete to correct those faultes: Yea they sought with great instance to frame their lief by the rule of notable personages: As Epaminondas by Lisias of Pythagoras sect: Agesilaus by Xenophon: Scipio by Panaetius, and infinit others.

Therfore doeth ech man seeke to couer the defaultes of nature, aswell

For although these imperfections may be layed to nature, yet doeth it greeue ech man to haue them in him self: bicause it seemeth by the testimonie of the self same nature that a man hath that default or blemishe (as it were) for a patent and token of his ill inclination. The fable that is reported of Epimetheus doeth also confirme myne opinion,Fable of Epimetheus.
                whiche was so vnskilfull in diuidinge the gyftes of nature vnto men, that he left them much more needie of euerye thinge, then all other liuinge creatures. Wherupon Prometheus stole the politike wysdome from Minerua and Vulcan that men haue to gete their liuinge withall. Yet had they not for all that, ciuill wisdome to gather them selues together into Cities, & the knowleage to liue with ciuility, bicause it was kept in the Castle of Iupiter by most circumspect ouerseears, whiche put Prometheus in suche feare, that he durst not approch nygh them. Wherupon Iupiter takinge pitye vpon the miserye of men, that could not felowshipp together for lacke of ciuill vertue, but were torne in peeces by wielde beastes, he sent Mercury to the earth to carie iustice and shame, that these two thinges might fournish Cities and gather Citizins together: and willed that they shoulde be giuen them, not as other artes were, wherin one counning man sufficeth for manie ignorant, as phisike, but y• they should be imprinted in euerie man. And ordeyned a lawe, that all such as were without iustice and shame, should be banished and put to death, as contagious to the Citie. Beehoulde then (my L. Octauian) God hath graunted these vertues to mē, & are not to be learned, but be naturall. Then y• 
               L. Octauian som what smiling, will you then, my L.

the wood and from his naturall libertye of his owne accord to snares and bondage, and with the same pollicy can not, or will not finde out artes whereby they maye profit themselues, and with studie & diligence make their mind more perfect?

I beleaue therfore that the morall vertues are not in vs all together by nature, bicause nothinge can at anye time be accustomed vnto it, that is naturallie his contrarie: as it is seene in a stone, the whiche though it be cast vpward ten thousand times, yet will he neuer accustome to go vp of him selfe·Uertues may be learned. Therfore in case vertues were as natural to vs, as heauinesse to the stone, we shoulde neuer accustome our selues to vice. Nor yet are vices naturall in this sort, for then shoulde we neuer be vertuous: and a great wickednesse and folie it were, to punishe men for the faultes that came of nature without oure offence: and this errour shoulde the lawes committ, whiche appoint not punishment to the offenders for the trespace that is past, bicause it can not be brought to passe that the thinge that is done, maye not be done, but they haue a respect to the time to come, that who so hath offended maye offende no more, or elles with yll president giue not a cause for others to offende. And thus yet they are in opinion that vertues maye be learned, whiche is most true, bicause we are borne apt to receiue them, and in like maner vices: and therfore there groweth a custome in vs of bothe the one and the other throughe longe vse, so that first we practise vertue or vice,A difference beetwene that a man hath by nature and by custome. after that, we are vertuous or vitious. The contrarie is knowen in the thinges that be geuen vs of nature, for firste we haue the pour to practise them, after that, we do practise: as it is in the senses, for first we can see, heere, feele, after that, we




do see, heere and feele: although notwithstandinge many of these doinges be also sett oute more sightlye with teachinge. Wherupon good Schoolmaist

Therfore euen as in the other artes, so also in the vertues it is behouffull to haue a teacher, that with lessons and good exhortations may stirr vp & quicken in vs those morall vertues, wherof we haue the seede inclosed and buried in the soule, & like the good husbande man, till them and open the waye for them, weedinge from about them the briers and darnell of appetites, which many times so shadow and choke our mindes, that they suffre them not to budd nor to bringe furth the happie frutes, which alone ought to be wished to grow in ye hartes of men. In this sort then is naturally in euerie one of vs iustice and shame, which (you saye) Iupiter sent to the earth for all men. But euen as a bodye without eyes, how sturdie euer he be, if he remoue to anie certein place, often times faileth: so the roote of these vertues that be potentiallie engendred in our mindes, yf it be not aided with teaching, doth often come to nought. Bicause if it shoulde be brought into doinge and to his perfect custome, it is not satisfied (as is said) with nature alone: but hath neede of a politike vsage & of reason, whiche maye clense and scoure that soule, takinge away the dymm veile of ignorance, wherof arrise (in a maner) all ye erroures in men. For in case good & ill were wel knowen and perceiued, euery man would alwaies chouse the good and shonn the yl. Therfore may vertue be said to be (as it were) a wisdome & an vnderstanding to chouse the good:Uertue. and vice, a lacke of foresight & an ignorance that leadeth to iudge falsely.Uice. Bicause men neuer chouse ye il with opinion that it is ill, but they are deceiued through a certein likenesse of good. Then answered ye

                then ye punishment that they doubt shall fall vpon them, as theeues, murtherers and such other. The L. Octauian said: true pleasure is alwaies good, and true sorow, euell: therfore these be deceiued in taking false pleasure for true, and true sorowe for false: wherupon manye times through false pleasures, they reun into true displeasures. The art therfore that teacheth to discerne this trueth from falshood, maye in like case be learned: and the vertue by the which we chouse this good in deede,True knowleage. and not that which falsely appeereth to be, may be called true knowleage, and more auailable for mans lief, then anye other, bicause it expelleth ignorance, of the which (as I haue said) springe all euelles. Then M. Peter Bembo, I wot not, my L. Octauian (quoth he) how the L. Gaspar should graunt you, that of ignoraunce should springe all euelles, and that there be not manye which in offendinge knowe for certeintie that they do offende, neyther are they anye deale deceiued in the true pleasure nor yet in the true sorow: bicause it is sure that such as be incontinent iudge with reason & vprightly, and know it, wher vnto they are prouoked by lust contrary to due, to be ill, & therefore they make resistance and sett reason to matche greedy desire, wherupon arriseth the battaile of pleasure and sorow against iudgement.Reason, Finally reason ouercome by greedie desire far the mightier, is cleane without succour, like a shippe, that for a time defendeth herself from the tempestuous Seastormes, at the end beaten with the to raginge violence of windes, her gables and tacklinges broken, yeldeth vp to be driuen at the will of fortune, wt
               out occupiyng helme or any maner help of Pilott for her safegard. Furthwith therefore commit they the offences with a certein doubtfull remorse of conscience & (in a maner) whether they will or no, ye which they would not do, onlesse they knew ye thing that they do to be ill, but without striuing of reason would ren wholy headlonge after




greedy desire, & then shoulde they not be incontinent, but vntemperate, which is much woorse. Therfore is incontinencie said to be a diminished vice,Incontinēcy. bicause it hath in it a part of reason,Continency. & likewise continency an vnperfect vertue, bicause it hath in it part of affection: therfore (me thinke) that it can not be said that the offences of the incontinent come of ignorance, or that they be deceiued and offende not, whan they know for a truth that they do offende. The L. Octauian answered: Certesse (M. Peter) youre argument is good, yet (in my minde) it is more apparant then true. For although the incontinent offend with that doubtfulnesse, & reason in their minde striueth againste greedye desire, & that that is yll, seemeth vnto them to be ill in deede, yet haue they no perfect knowleage of it, nor vnderstand it so throughly as nede requireth. Therfore of this, it is rather a feeble opinion in them, then certeine knowleage, wherby they agree to haue reason ouercome by affectiō: but if they had in them true knowleage, there is no doubt, but they would not offend: bicause euermore ye thinge wherby greedie desire ouercometh reason, is ignorance neyther can true knowleage be euer ouercome by affection,Ignorance. that proceadeth from ye body & not from the mind, & in case it be wel ruled & gouerned by reason it becommeth a vertue: yf not it beecommeth a vice.Reason. But such force reason hath, that she maketh the sense alwaies to obey and by wonderous meanes & wayes perceth least ignorance shoulde possesse that, which she ought to haue: so that althoughe ye spirites and the sinewes, and the bones haue no reason in them, yet whan there springeth in vs ye motion of minde, that ye imagination (as it were) pricketh forward and shaketh the bridle to the spirites, all ye members are in a readinesse, the feete to renn, ye hands to take or to d

it was, it doeth not only greeue them & loth them in their minde, but the bodie also agreeth with the iudgement of the minde, that of force they cast that meate vp again. The L.

Octauian (ꝙ he (yf I haue well vnderstoode, you haue said that cōtinencie is an vnperfect vertue, bicause it hath in it part of affection: and me seemeth that the vertue (where there is in oure minde a variance beetwene reason and greedie desyre) whiche fighteth and giueth the victorye to reason, ought to be reckened more perfect, then that which ouercommeth hauinge neyther greedie desire nor anie affection to withstand it: bicause (it seemeth) that that minde absteyneth not from yll for vertues sake, but refrayenth the doing it, bicause he hath no will to it.

He, quoth the L. Iulian, that ouercommeth with most suretie, is out of doubt most to be praised, so that this assured victorie of his proceade not through the slackenesse of the ennemies The L. Octauian answered: you haue iudged aright.

Octauian answered: I haue not said that tēperance shoulde throughlye ridd and roote oute of mens mindes, affections: neyther shoulde it be well so to do, bicause there be yet in affections some partes good: but that which in affections is corrupt and striuing against honestie, she bringeth to obey vnto reason. Therfore it is not meete, to ridd the troublesome disquietnesse of the mind, to roote vp affections cleane, for this were as if to a voide dronkennesse, there shoulde be an act established, that no man shoulde drinke wine: or bicause otherwhile in renninge a man taketh a fall, euerie man should be forbed renning. Marke them that breake horses, they breake them not




from their renninge and comminge on loft, but they will haue them to do it at the time and obedience of the rider. The affections therfore that be clensed and tried by temperance are assistant to vertue, as angre, that helpeth manlinesse: hatred against the wicked, helpeth iustice, and likewise the other vertues are aided by affections, which in case they were cleane taken away, they woulde leaue reason verie feeble and feint, so that it shoulde litle preuaile, like a shipp maister that is without winde in a great caulme. Maruaile ye not then (my L. Cesar) if I haue said, that of temperance arrise manie other vertues: for whan a minde is in tune with this harmonie, by the meane of reason he easely receiueth afterward true manlinesse, which maketh him boulde and safe from all daunger,True manlinesse. and (in a maner) aboue wordly passions. Likewise Iustice an vndefiled virgin, friend to sobermode and goodnesse,Iustice. queene of all other vertues, bicause she teacheth to do that, which a man ought to do, and to shon that a man ought to shonn, and therfore is she most perfect, bicause through her the woorkes of the other vertues are brought to passe, and she is a helpe to him that hath her both for him selfe and for others: without the which (as it is commanlye said) Iupiter him selfe coulde not well gouern hys kingdome.Stoutnesse of courage. Stoutnesse of courage doeth also folowe after these, and maketh them all the greater, but she can not stand alone, bicause whoso hath not other vertues can not be of a stoute courage. Of these then wisdome is guide, which consisteth in a certein iudgemēt to chouse well.Wisdome. And in this happie chayne are also lincked liberalitie, sumptuousnesse, the desire to saue a mans estymation, meekenesse, pleasantnesse, courtesie in talke, and manie other which is nowe no time to speake of. But in case oure Courtier wyll do as we haue saide, he shall finde them all in his Princis minde: and daylie he shall see springe suche beawtifull floures and frutes, as all the delicious gardeins in the world haue not the

Which alone were sufficient to make men happie, and to bring once again into the worlde the golden age, whiche is written to haue bine whan Saturnus reigned in the olde time.The reigne of a good Prince. Here whan the L. Octauian had paused a litle as though he woulde haue taken respite, the L. Gaspar said: Whiche recken you (my L. Octauian) the happiest gouernment and that were most to pourpose to bring into the world again that golden age whych you haue made mention of, eyther the reigne of so good a Prince, or the gouernance of a good Commune weale? The L. Octauian answered: I woulde alwayes prefarr the reigne of a good Prince, bicause it is a gouernment more agreeable to nature, and (if it be lawfull to compare small matters with infinit) more like vnto Goddes, whiche one, and alone gouerneth the vniuersall. But leauinge this, ye see that in whatsoeuer is broug

Beeside this it seemeth meete that people shoulde aswell be gouerned by one Prince, as manye other liuinge creatures be, whom nature teacheth this obedience, as a moste soueraign matter. Marke ye whether deere, cranes & manye other foules, whā thei take their

a Prince beefore, whom they folowe and obey. And bees (as it were) with discourse of reason and with such reuerence honour their kinge, as the most obedientest people in the world can do. And therfore all this is a verie great argument that the so
                  •
               eraigntie of a Prince is more accordinge to nature, then a Commune weales. Then M. Peter Bembo, and me thinke (quoth he) that sins God hath giuen vs libertie for a soueraigne gifte,Libertye. it is not reason that it should be taken from vs: nor that one man should be partner of it more then an other, which happeneth vnder the rule of princis, who for the most part keepe their people in most streict bondage. But in Commune weales well in order this libertie is well kept. Beeside that, both in iudgementes and in aduisementes it happeneth oftner that the opinion of one alone is false, then the opinion of many, bicause troublous affection either through anger, or throughe spite, or through lust, sooner entreth into the mind of one alone then into the multitudes, whi

               he (in a maner) like a greate quantitie of water, is lesse subiect to corruption, then a smalle deale. I saye again that the example of the beastes and foules doth not make to pourpose, for both Deere and Cranes and the rest doe not alwaies sett one and the selfe formost for them to folowe and obey, but they still chaunge and varie, giuinge this prefarment somtime to one, otherwhile to an other, and in this maner it beecommeth rather the fourme of a Commune weale, then of a kingdome, and this maye be called a true and equall libertie, whan they that somtime commaunde, obey again an other while. The example likewise of the bees (me thinke) is not alike, bicause that kinge of theirs is not of their owne kinde: And therefore he that will giue vnto men a w

               rthie head in deede, must be faine to finde him of an other kinde, and of a more noble nature then mans, if menne (of reason) shoulde obey him, as flockes and heardes of cattell that obey, not a beast their like, but a sheppharde and a hardman, which




is a man and of a more woorthie kinde, then theirs. For these respectes, I thynke (my L. Octauian) the gouernment of a Commune weale is more to be coueted, then of a kinge. Then the L. Octauian, against your opinion, M. Peter (quoth he) I will alleage but one reason: whiche is, that of wayes to rule people well, there be onlye three kindes. The one a kingdome: The other,Three kindes of wayes to rule. the rule of good men, whiche they of olde tyme called Optimates, The third, the gouernance of the people. And the transgressinge (to terme it so) and contrarie vice that euery one of these is chaunged into beeinge apayred and corrupted, is whan the kingdome beecommeth a Tyrannie: and whan the gouernance of good men is chaunged into the handes of a few great men and not good: and whan the rule of the people is at the disposition of the cōmunaltye, whiche making a meddlie of the ordres, suffreth the gouernance of the wholl at ye wil of the multitude. Of these three yll gouernmentes (it is sure) the Tyrannie is the woorst of al, as it may be proued by many reasons. It foloweth then, that of the three good, the kingdome is the best, bicause it is contrarye to the woorste, for (as you knowe) the effectes of contrarie causes, they be also contrarye emong them selues. Nowe as touchinge it, that you haue spoken of lybertye, I answere, that true liberty ought not to be saide to liue as a manne will, but to lyue accordynge to good lawes. And to obey, is no lesse naturall, profitable and necessarye, then to commaunde. And some thinges are borne and so appointed and ordeyned by nature to commaunde, as some other to obeysance. Truth it is, that there be two kyndes of bearinge rule, the one Lordlye and forsyble,Two kindes of wayes to beare swinge. as maisters ouer slaues, and in this doeth the soule commaunde the bodye. The other more milde and tractable, as good Princis by waye of the lawes ouer their Subiectes, and in this reason commaundeth greedie desire. And ech of these two wayes is proifitable: bicause the bodye is




created of nature apte to obey the soule, and so is desire, reason. There be also manye menne whose doinges be applied onlye about the vse of the body: and such as these be are so farr wide from the vertuous, as the soule from the bodye, and yet bicause they be reasonable creatures, they be so much partners of reason, as they doe no more but know it, for they possesse it not, ne yet haue they the vse of it. These therefore be naturallye bondemen, and better it is for them and more profitable to obeye, then to beare swey. Then saide the L. Gaspar: In what maner wise be they then to be commaunded that be discreete and vertuous and not by nature bonde?How good men be to be ruled. The L. Octauian answered: With that tractable commaundment kinglye and ciuill. And to such it is well done otherwhile to committe the bearinge of suche offices as be meete for them, that they maye likewise beare swey and rule ouer others of lesse witt then they be, yet so that the principal gouernement maye full and wholye depende vppon the cheef Prince. And bicause you haue said, that it is an easier matter to corrupt the minde of one, then of a great sort, I saye, that it is also an easier matter to finde one good and wise,A kinge. then a great sorte. Both good and wise ought a man to suppose a kinge maye be, of a noble pr

And though he be not of an other kinde then man, as you haue saide is emonge the bees, yet yf he be helped forwarde with the instructions, bringinge vp, and art of the Courtier, whom these Lordes haue facioned so wise and good, he shall be moste wise, moste continent, moste temperate, moste manlye, and moste iuste, full of liberalitie, maiestie, holynesse, and mercye: finallye he shall be moste glorious and moste deerlye beloued both to God and manne: throughe whose grace he shall atteine vnto that heroicall and noble vertue, that shall make him passe the b

of manne, and shall rather be called a Demy God,God the defendour of good Princis. then a manne mortall. For God deliteth in and is the defendour not of those Princis that will folowe and counterfeit him in showinge great poure, and make themselues to be woorshipped of menne, but of such as beeside poure, whereby they are mightye, endeuour themselues to resemble him also in goodnesse and wisdome, wherby they maye haue a will and a knowleage to doe well and to be his ministers, distributinge for the beehouf of manne the benifittes and giftes that they receiue of him. Therfore euen as in the firmamente the sonne and the moone and the other sterres show to the world (as it were) in a glasse a certeine likenesse of God:A good Prince an Image of God. So vppon the earth a muche more liker image of God are those good Princis that loue and woorshippe him, and showe vnto the people the cleere light of his iustice, accompanied with a shadowe of the heauenlye reason and vnderstandinge: And suche as these be doeth God make partners of his true dealing, rightuousnesse, iustice and goodnesse, and of those other happy benifittes which I can not name, that disclose vnto the worlde a much more euident proof of the Godhead, then doeth the light of the sonne, or the continuall tourninge of the firmamente with the sundrye course of the sterres. It is God therfore that hath appointed the people vnder ye custodie of Princis, which ought to haue a diligent care ouer them, that they may make him accompt of it, as good stewardes do their Lord, and loue them and thinke their owne, all the profit & losse that happeneth to them, & principally aboue all thing prouide for their good astate & welfare. Therfore ought the prince not only to be good, but also to make others good, like the Carpenters square, that is not only straight & iust it self, but also maketh straight & iust whatsoeuer it is occupied about. And the greatest proofe that the Prince is good,The li

of him must needes al others depende: neyther is it meete for one that is ignorant, to teach: nor for him that is out of order, to giue order: nor for him that falleth, to help vp an other.

Cleane contrarie to this therfore ought the lief of a good Prince to be, free and safe & as deere to his subiectes as their owne: & so framed, that he may haue a parte of both the doinge and beeholdinge lief, asmuche as shall be beehouffull for the benefit of hys people. Then the L Gaspar, And whiche of the two liues, my L. Octauian (quoth he) do you thinke most meete for a Prince? The L. Octauian answered smilinge: ye thinke perhappes that I stande in mine owne conceite to be the excellent Courtier that ought to knowe so manye matters, and to applye them to the good end I haue spoken of. But remembre your selfe, that these Lordes haue facioned him with manie qualityes that be not in me: therefore let vs firste doe our best to finde him out, for I remytt me to him both in this and in al other thinges that belong to a good Prince.




Then the L. Gaspar, I thinke (ꝙ he) that if anye of the qualities geuen the Courtier want in you, it is rather musike and daunsinge and the rest of smalle accompt, then such as beelong to the instructing of a Prince and to this ende of Courtlines. The L. Octauian answered: They are not of small accompt all of them that help to purchase a man the fauour of a Prince, which is necessarie (as we haue said) before the Courtier auenture to teach him vertue, the which (I trowe) I haue showed you may be learned, and profiteth asmuch as ignorance hurteth, whereof springe all vices, and speciallye that false leekinge a man hath of him selfe. Therefore (in mine opinion) I haue sufficientlye said, and perhappes more then my promise was.

Then the L Gaspar, My L. Octauian (quoth he) bicause you haue muche praysed good bringing vp, and seemed (in a maner) to beleaue that it is the cheef cause to make a man vertuous & good, I would knowe, whether the Courtiers instructing of hys Prince, ought to beegine firste of vse and (as it were) daylye facio

                whether into that minde of his, the vertues ought to be driuen & grounded with reason and vnderstanding first, or with custome. The L. Octauian said: you bringe me into ouerlonge a discourse. Yet bicause you shall not thinke that I will slacke for that I am not willing to make answere to your requestes, I saye, that like as the soule and the bodye in vs are two thinges, so is the soule diuided into two partes: whereof the one hath in it reason, and the other appetite.Reason. Euen as therefore in generation the bodye go

               th beefore the soule,Appetite. so doeth the vnreanable part of the soule go before the reasonable: the whiche is plainlye to be descerned in yonge babes, who (in a maner) immediatlye after their birthe vttre angre and feruent appetite, but afterwarde in processe of time reason appeereth. Therfore first must the bodye be cherished beefore the soule: after that, the appetite beefore reason: but the cherishinge of the bodye for a respect to the soule, and of the appetite for a respect to reason. For as the vertue of the minde is made perfecte with learninge, so is the ciuill wyth custome. Therefore ought there to be a grounde made firste wyth custome, whiche maye gouerne the appetites not yet apt to conceyue reason: and wyth that good vse leade them to goodnesse: afterwarde settle them wyth vnderstandynge, the whyche althoughe she be laste to showe her light, yet doeth she the more perfectlye make the vertues to be inioyed of whoso hathe his mynde well instructed wyth maners, wherein (in mine opinion) consisteth the wholl. The L. Gaspar saide: Beefore ye proceade anye farther, I woulde knowe howe the body should be cherished:Cherishing of the bo

                  ye. bicause you haue saide that we must cherishe it beefore the soule. The L. Octauian answered smiling: know of these mē that




make much of it and are faire and rounde, as for mine (as you see) it is not half well cherished. Yet may there also be much said in this beehalf: As, the time meete for mariage, that children be neither to nigh nor to farr of from the fathers age: Exercises, and bringinge vp soone after there birth, and in the rest of their lief to make them handsome, towardlie, and liuelie. The L. Gaspar answered: The thing that woulde best please women to make their children handsome and welfauoured (in my minde) were the felowship that Plato will haue of them in his Commune weale, and in that wise. Then the Lady Emilia smilinge, It is not in the couenaunt (ꝙ she) that ye shoulde a freshe fall to speake yll of women. I suppose, answered the L. Gaspar, that I giue them a great praise, in sainge that they shoulde desire to haue a custome brought vp, which is alowed of so woorthye a man. The L. Cesar Gonzaga said laughing: Let vs see whether amonge the L. Octauians lessons (yet I wott not whether he haue spoken al or no) this may take place: and whether it were well done the Prince should establish it for a lawe or no The few that I haue spoken, answered the L. Octauian, may perhappes be inough to make a good Prince, as Princes go nowadayes. Although if a man would go more narrowly to woorke in the matter, there were muche more for him yet to saye. Then said the Dutchesse: Sins it costeth vs nothinge but woordes, show vs of good felowshippe that, that woulde come in youre mind to teach your Prince. The L. Octauian answered: Manie other matters I woulde teache hym (madam) if I knew them my selfe: and amonge the rest, that he should pike out a certein numbre of Gentilmen emonge his subiectes, of the noblest and wisest,A counsell o

I would tell him how that of iustice also dependeth the zeale toward God, which beelongeth vnto all men and especiallye to Princis, who ought to loue him aboue all thinges, and to direct all their doinges vnto him, as vnto the true end: And (as Xenophon saith) to honoure and loue him alwayes, but much more in prosspiritie, bicause they maye afterwarde lefullye with a more confidence call to him for assistance whan they bee in anye aduersitye: for it is not possible to gouern either himself or others well, without the help of God, who vnto the good sendeth otherwhile good fortune for his minister, to helpe them out of great daungers, sometime aduersitye leaste they shoulde slumber so much in

With suche meanes I woulde counsell the Prince to do his best to preserue his subiectes in quiet astate, and to giue them the gooddes of the mynde,Goodes of the minde, of the bodye and of fortune. and of the bodye and of fortune: but them of the bodye and of fortune, that they maye exercise them of the minde, whiche the greater and plentier they be, so much the more profitable be they: that happeneth not in them of the bodye, nor of fortune: In case therefore the subiectes bee good and of woorthynesse and well bent to the ende of happynes, that Prince shall be a verye great Lorde: for that is a true and a greate gouernement, vnder the whyche the subiectes be good, well ruled and well commaunded. Then the L. Gaspar, I suppose (quoth he) that he shoulde be but a smalle Lorde, vnder whom the subiectes were all good. For in euerye place there be fewe good. The L Octauian answered: In case some certeine Circe shoulde iourne into wilde beastes all the Frenche Kinges subiectes,Not the multitude, but the woorthy. woulde not you thinke him a smalle Lorde for all he reigned ouer so manye thousande beastes? And contrarywyse yf onelye the Cattell that scattre abrode feadynge aboute oure Mountaignes here, might become wise menne, and valiaunt Gentilmen, woulde not you thinke that heardmenne that shoulde gouerne them and haue them obedient to them, of heardmen were become great Lordes? you maye see then, that not the multytude of Subiectes, but the woorthynesse of them maketh Princis greate.

For in case the Romanes, Alexander, Hanniball, and ye rest had had these respectes they should neuer




haue reached to the toppe of the glorye they did. The L. Octauian answered then smiliinge: Such as had not these recpectes shoulde haue done the better in case they had hadd them: althoughe if ye consider well, ye shall finde that manie had them, and especiallye those auntientest of olde time, as Theseus, and Hercules. And thinke not that Procustes, Scyron, Caccus, Diomedes, Antheus and Gerion were anye other then cruell and wicked Tirannes againste whom these noble couraged Demigoddes kept continual & mortal warr, and therfore, for ridding the world of such intollerable monstres (for Tyrannes ought not to be called by other name) vnto Hercules were made Temples,Tirānes monstres. and sacrifices, and godlye honours giuen him, bicause the benefit to roote vp Tirannes is so profitable to the worlde, that who so doeth it, deserueth a farre greater rewarde, then whatso euer is meete for a mortall man. And of them you haue named, Do you not thinke that Alexander did profit with his victories the vanquished? sins he so traded those barbarous nations whiche he ouercame, wt such good maners, that of wylde beastes he made them men?
                  Alexander profited the vanquished. He built manye beawtifull Cities in Countreis ill inhabited, plantinge therin ciuill kinde of liuing, and (as it were) coopled Asia and Europe together with the bonde of amitie & holye lawes, so that the vanquished by him were more happie then ye rest, bicause emong some he brought in matrimonie: emong other, husbandrie: emong other, religion: emonge other, not to sley, but to make muche of their parentes in their olde age: emong other, ye refraining from bedding with their mothers, and a thousand other matters, that might be said for a witnesse of ye profit which his victories brought to the world.

good pourpose: and in case anye maner enuye or strife of matching others arrise at any time emong them, it shall be, who shall be the first, and most inclined and most couragious in so glorious an enterprise. But let vs leaue this kinde of talke, and retourne vnto our owne. Unto you therfore (my L. Cesar) I say, that such thinges as you would haue the Prince to do, be very great and worthye muche praise. But you must vnderstand that if he be not skilfull in that I haue saide he ought to haue a knowleage in, and haue not framed his minde in that wise, and bent it to the waye of vertue, it shall bee harde for him to haue the knowleage to be noble couraged, liberall, iust, quicke-spirited, wise, or to haue any other of those qualities that beelong vnto him: neither would I haue him to be suche a one for anye other thinge, but to haue the vnderstanding to put in vre these condicions (for as they that build, be not all good woorkemen,Libera
                     •
                  itye. so they that giue, be not all liberall) for vertue neuer hurteth anye man: and manye there be, that laye hande on other mens gooddes to giue, and so are lauish of an other mens substance. Some giue to them they ought not, and leaue in wretchednesse and miserie such as they be bound to. Other giue with a certein yll will and (as it were) with a dispite, so that it is knowen they do it, bicause they can do none other. Other do not onlye not kepe it secrete, but they call witnesse of it, and (in a maner) cause their liberalities to be cried. Other foolishlye at a sodeine emptye the fountain of liberalitye,Knowleage. so that afterwarde they can vse it no more. Therfore in this point (as in all other matters) he must haue a knowleage, and gouern him self with the wisdome that is a companion vnto all the other vertues whiche for that they are in the milde,Uertue in the middle. be nygh vnto the two extremities, that be vices. Wherefore he that hath not knoweleage renneth soone into them. For as it is a harde matter in a circle to find out the pricke in the centre, whiche is the middle, so is it harde to find out the pricke of




vertue placed in the middle beetwene two extreme vyces, the one for the ouermuch, and the other for the ouerlitle, & vnto these we are inclined sometime to the one, sometime to the other, and this is knowen by the pleasure and greef that is felt within vs, for through the one we doe the thinge that we ought not, and through the other we leaue vndone that, which we ought to do: although pleasure be muche more daungerous, bicause oure iudgement is soone lead by it to be corrupted. But bicause the perseuerance how farr a man is wide from the centre of vertue, is a hard matter, we ought by litle and litle to draw
                  •
                backe of oure selues to the contrarie part of this extremytye, whiche we know we be inclined vnto, as they do, that make straight crooked staues, for by that meane we shall draw nighe vnto vertue, which is placed (as I haue said) in that pricke of the meane: wherby it cōmeth that by manye wayes we be wide, and by one alone we do oure office and dutye: like as Archers by one waye alone hitte the marke, and by manye mysse the pricke. Therefore oftentimes a Prince to be gentle and lowelye,Extremities, vices doeth manye thinges contrarie to comelinesse, and so humbleth him selfe that he is nought sett by. Some other to show a graue maiestye with authoritye according, beecommeth cruell and vntollerable. Some one, to be counted eloquente, entreth into a thowsande straunge matters and longe processes with curious woordes giuing ear to hym selfe, so that other men can not for lothsomenesse heare him. Therfore (my L Cesar) do you not call a smalle matter anye thing that maye better a Prince how small so euer it be. Nor thinke that I iudge it to be in the reproofe of my lessons where you say,A good Prince a good gouernour. that a good Gouernour were ther instructed therewithall, then a good Prince: for perhappes there can not be a greater praise nor more comlye for a Prince, then to call him a good Gouernour. Therfore if it shoulde fall to my lott to instruct him, he should haue a care not only to gouern ye matters alreadye




spoken of, but also farre lesser, and vnderstande in peecemeale whatsoeuer belongeth to his people, asmuch as were possible: and neuer credite nor trust any officer so muche, as to giue him the bridle wholy into his handes, and the disposinge of the wholl gou

Then said M. Bernarde Bibiena smilinge: You beegine (my L. Octauian) to take my L. Gaspars and Phrisios part. Then the L. Octauian answered in like maner smilyng: The




controuersye is ended, and I entende not nowe to renue it. Therfore wil I speake no more of women, but retourn to my prince: Phrisio answered: you may now leaue him hardely, and be contented to haue him suche a one as you haue instructed him.Good Princes verye scant. For doubtles it wer an easier matter to find out a woman of the qualities the L. Iulian hath spoken of, then a prince of the qualities that you would haue in him. Therfore (I feare me) he is like the Commune weale of Plato, and we shall neuer see suche a one, onlesse it bee perhappes in heauen. The L. Octauian answered: thinges possible, though they be hard, yet is it to be hoped that they maye be: therefore maye we yet parhappes see him vpon the earth in oure time. For althoughe the heauens be so scante in bringinge furth excellent Princis, that in so manye hundreth yeeres we do scantlye see one, yet may this good lucke happen to vs. Then said Count Lewes: I haue a good hope of it.

ended as much as he had to saye, You haue now heard, madam (quoth he) what I am able to say of the ende of the Courtier, wherin though I haue not satisfied in all pointes, it shall suffice me yet, that I haue showed, that some other perfection may be giuen him beside the matters whych these Lordes haue spoken of, who (I beleaue) haue lefte out both this and what so euer I am able to saye, not bycause they knew it not better then I, but bicause they were loth to take the peynes: therfore will I giue them leaue to go forward, if they haue anye thinge elles lefte beehinde to be saide. Then said the Dutchesse: Beeside that it is late (for within a while it will be time for vs to make an ende for this night) me thinke, we ought not to mingle anye other talke with this, wherin you haue gathered together suche sundrye and goodlye matters, that concerninge the ende of Courtlinesse, it may be said, that you are not onlie the perfect Courtier whom we seke for, and able to instruct your Prince well, but also (if fortune be so fauourable on your side) ye maye be the good Prince your self, whiche shoulde not be withoute great profit to your Countrey. Then laughed the L. Octauian and said: Perhappes (madam) were I in that astate, it woulde be with me as it is with manye others that can better saye well, then do well.

               d time, the L. Iulian saide smilinge: Madam, I am so verie an ennemye to crafte and guile, that needes must I speake against the L. Octauian: who for that he is (as I muche doubt him) a secrete conspiratour with the L. Gaspar againste women, hath ouershott himselfe in committing of two errours (in mine opinion) very great: wherof the one is, that meaninge to preferr this Courtier beefore the Gentilwoman of the Palaice, & to make him to passe those boundes that she is not able to reache to, he hath also preferred him beefore the Prince, whiche




is most vnseemlye. The other, that he hath giuen him suche an ende, that it is euermore harde and otherwhile vnpossible for him to comebye it: and yet whan he doeth come by it, he ought not to haue the name of a Courtier. I can not see: quoth the L. Emilia, howe it is harde or vnpossible for the Courtier to come bye this his ende, nor yet howe the L. Octauian hath prefarred him beefore the Prince. Graunt it him not, answered the L, Octauian
               ▪ for I haue not preferred the Courtier beefore the Prince. And as touchinge the ende of Courtlinesse. I dare vndertake that I am not ouerseene in any point. Then answered the L. Iulian: You can not say (my L. Octauian) that alwaies the cause, by the which the effect is such as it is, is no more suche as the effect is. Therfore needes must the Courtier, by whose instruction the prince must be of such an excellencye, be more excellente then the prince: and in this wise shall he be also of a more woorthinesse then the prince himselfe, which is most vnsittinge. Then concerninge the ende o

But in case the prince be olde and the Courtier yong: it is meete that the old prince knowe more then the yonge Courtier, and where this foloweth not alwaies, it foloweth somtime, and then is the ende which you haue appointed to the Courtier vnpossible.

Wherfore he that instructeth a Prince (I beleue) ought not to be called a Courtier, but deserueth a far greater and a more honorable name. Therfore (my L. Octauian) perdon me in case I haue opened this your craftye conue

               ance, which I thinke my self bounde to do for the honour of my woman, whom you would haue to be of lesse worthines then this Courtier of yours, & I wil none of that. The L. Octauian laughed and saide: A more praise it were for the Gentilwoman of the Palaice (my L. Iulian) to exalt her so muche that she maye be equall with the Courtier, then so much to debase the Courtier that he shoulde be equall with the Gentilwoman of the Palaice: for it were not vnfitt for the woman also to instruct her ladye,This ende of the Courtier serueth also for a Gentil woman with her Lady. and with her to drawe to the same ende of Courtlinesse, whiche I haue said is meete for the Courtier with his prince. But you seeke more to dispraise the Courtier, then to praise the Gentilwoman of the Palaice, therfore shall it become me also to take part with the Courtier. Now to make you answere to youre obiections, you shall vnderstande that I haue not saide, that the instruction of the Courtier ought to be the onelye cause why the Prynce shoulde be such a one, for in case he be not inclined of nature and apt to be suche a one, all diligence and exhortacion of the Courtier were in vaine. As in like maner euery good husband man should labour in vaine, yt would take in hande to tyll and sowe with good graine the barraine sande of the Sea, bicause this barrainnesse in that place is naturall.

For there can not be imagined a more noble Philosophy, then to bringe to a ciuill trade of liuing such wild people as were the inhabitauntes of Bactria and Gaucasus, India and Scithia, and to teache them matrimonie, husbandrye, to honour their fathers, to abstaine from robbinge and killinge and from other noughty condicions, & to builde so many most noble Cities in straunge Countries, so that infinit throughe those lawes were brought from a wilde lief to liue lyke men.He rebuked Alexander for beeinge woorshipped as a god, and therfore died vpon the rack.

                  •
               , the L. Gaspar sayde: I had not thought oure Courtier hadd ben
                  •
                so woorthy a personage. But sins Aristotel and Plato be his mates, I iudge no man ought to disdeigne this name anye more. Yet wett I not whether I may beleaue that Aristotel and Plato euer daunsed or were musitiens in all their lief time, or practised other feates of chiualrye. The L. Octauian answered: Almost it is not lawfull to thinke that these two diuine wittes were not skilfull in euerye thinge, and therfore it is to be presupposed that they practised what euer beelongeth to Courtlynesse. For where it commeth to pourpose they so penn the matter, that the very craftes maisters them selues know by theyr writinges that they vnderstoode the whol euen to the pith and innermost rootes. Wherefore to a Courtier or instructer of a Prince (howe euer ye lust to terme him) that tendeth to the good ende, which we haue spoken of, it is not to be said but that all the good qualities which these Lordes haue giuen him do beelonge, though he were neuer so graue a Philosopher or holie in his maners: bicause they striue not against goodnesse, discreation, knoweleage and will, in all age, and in all time and place. Then the L. Gaspar,
               The Courtier a louer. I remembre (quoth he) that these Lordes yesternight reasoninge of the Courtiers qualities, did alowe him to be a louer, and in makinge rehersall of asmuche as hitherto hath bene spoken, a manne maye pike out a conclusion, That the Courtier (whiche with his worthynesse and credit must incline his Prince to vertue) must in maner of necessitie be aged, for knoweleage commeth verye syldome times beefore yeeres, and speciallye in matters that bee learned wyth experyence: I can not see, whan hee is well drawen in yeeres, howe it wyll stande well wyth hym to be a louer, considerynge (as




it hath bine said the other night) Loue framet h not with olde men, and the trickes that in yonge men be galauntnesse, courtesie and precisenesse so acceptable to women, in them are meere folies and fondnesse to be laughed at, and purchase him that vseth them hatred of women and mockes of others. Therfore in case this your Aristotel an old Courtier were a louer, and practised the feates that yong louers do (as some that we haue sene in our daies) I feare me, he woulde forgete to teach his Prince: and parauenture boyes would mocke him behinde his backe, and womē would haue none other delite in him but to make him a iesting stocke. Then said the L. Octauian: Sins all the other qualities appointed to the Courtier are meete for him, althoughe he be olde, me thinke we shoulde not then barr him from this happinesse to loue. Nay rather, quoth the L. Gaspar, to take this loue from him, is a perfection ouer and aboue, and a makynge him to lyue happilie out of miserie and wretchednesse. M. Peter Bembo said: Remember you not (my L Gaspar) that the L. Octauian declared the other nighte in his diuise of pastymes, although he be not skilfull in loue, to knowe yet that there be some louers, which recken the disdeignes, the angres, the debates and tourmentes whiche they receiue of their Ladies, sweete? Wherupon he required to be taught the cause of this sweetenesse. Therfore in case oure Courtier (thoughe he be olde) were kendled with those loues that be

               weete without any bitter smacke, he should feele no miserie nor wretchednesse at all. And beeing wise, as we set case he is, he shoulde not be deceiued in thinkinge to be meete for him what so euer were meete for yong men, but in louinge shoulde perhappes loue after a sorte, that might not onlye not bringe him in sclaunder but to muche praise and great happinesse, without any lothsomnes at all, the which verie sildome or (in maner) neuer happeneth to yonge men: & so should he neyther lay aside the teachinge of his Prince, nor yet commit any thinge that




should deserue the mockinge of boyes. Then spake the Dutchesse: I am glad (M. Peter) that you haue not bine muche troubled, in oure reasoninges this night, for now we maye be the boulder to giue you in charge to speake, and to teache the Courtier this so happie a loue, which bringeth with it neither sclaunder, nor any inconuenience: for perhappes it shall be one of the necessariest and profitablest qualities that hitherto hath bine giuen him, therefore speake of good felowship asmuch as you know therin. M. Peter laughed and saide: I would be loth (Madam) where I say that it is lefull for olde men to loue, it should be an occasion for these Ladyes to thinke me olde: therefore hardely giue ye this enterprise to an other. The Dutchesse answered: You ought not to refuse to be counted olde in knowleage, thoughe ye be yonge in yeeres. Therfore saye on, and excuse your selfe no more. M. Peter said: Surelye (madam) if I must entreate vpon this matter, I must first go aske counsell of my Heremite Lauinello. The L. Emilia said then halfe in angre: There is neuer a one in al the company so disobedient as you be (M. Peter) therfore shoulde the Dutchesse doe well to chastice you somewhat for it. M. Peter said smilinge: for loue of God (madam) be not angrye with me, for I will say what euer you will haue me. God to, saye on then, answered the L. Emilia. Then M. Peter after a whiles silence, somewhat settlinge hymselfe as thoughe he shoulde entreat vppon a waightie matter,Olde men may loue without sclaunder. said thus: My Lordes, to showe that olde menne maye loue not onlie without sclaunder, but otherwhile more happilye then yonge menne, I must be enforced to make a litle discourse to declare what loue is, and wherein consisteth the happinesse that louers maye haue. Therefore I beseche ye giue the hearynge wyth heedefulnesse, for I hope to make you vnderstand, that it were not vnsitting for anye man here to be a louer, in case he were xv. or xx. yeeres elder then M. Morello. And here after they had laughed 
                  •
                while, M. Peter proceaded. I saye therefore that accordinge




as it is defined of the wise menn of olde time) Loue is nothinge elles but a certein couetinge to enioy beawtie:What loue is. and forsomuch as couetinge longeth for nothinge,Knowleage. but for thinges knowen, it is requisite that knowleage go euermore before coueting,
               Coueting which of his owne nature willeth the good, but of him self is blind, & knoweth it not. Therfore hath nature so ordeined, that to euery vertue of knowleag ther is annexed a vertue of longing. And bicause in oure soule there be three maner wayes to know, namelye, by sense, reason, and vnderstandinge: of sense, there arriseth appetite or longinge,Sense. which is commune to vs with brute beastes:Reason. of reason arriseth election or choise, which is proper to man: of vnderstanding, by the which man may be partner with Aungelles,Understandinge. arriseth will. Euen as therfore the sense knoweth not but sensible matters and that which may be felt, so the appetyte or couetinge onlye desireth the same: and euen as the vnderstanding is bent but to beehoulde thinges that may be vnderstoode, so is that wil only fead with spirituall gooddes. Man of nature indowed with reason, placed (as it were) in the middle beetwene these two extremities, may through his choise inclinynge to sense, or reachynge to vnderstandynge, come nigh to the couetinge sometime of the one somtime of the other part.Beawtie. In these sortes therfore may beawtie be coueted, the general name wherof may be applied to al thinges, eyther naturall or artificiall, that are framed in good proportion, and due tempre, as their nature beareth. But speakynge of the beawtie that we meane, which is onlie it, that appeereth in bodies, and especially in the face of mann, and moueth thys feruent couetinge which we call Loue, we will terme it an influence of the heauenlie bountifulness, the whiche for all it stretcheth ouer all thynges that be created (like the light of the Sonn) yet whan it findeth out a face well proportioned,The face. and framed with a certein liuelie agreement of seuerall colours, and setfurthwith lightes and shadowes, and with an orderly




distaunce and limites of lines, therinto it distilleth it self and appeereth most welfauoured, and decketh out and lyghtneth the subiect where it shyneth wyth a marueylous grace and glistringe (like the Sonne beames that strike against beawtifull plate of fine golde wrought and sett wyth precyous iewelles) so that it draweth vnto it mens eyes with pleasure, and percing through them imprinteth him selfe in the soule, and wyth an vnwonted sweetenesse all to stirreth her and delyteth, and settynge her on fire maketh her to couett him. Whan the soule then is taken wyth: couetynge to enioye thys beawtie as a good thynge, in case she suffre her selfe to be guyded with the iudgement of sense, she falleth into most deepe erroures, and iudgeth the bodie in whyche Beawtye is descerned, to be the principall cause thereof: wherupon to enioye it, she reckeneth it necessarye to

               oigne as inwardlye as she can wyth that bodye, whyche is false:In possessing the body beawtie is not enioied and therefore who so thynketh in possessynge the bodye to inioye beawtie, he is farr deceiued, and is moued to it, not wyth true knowleage by the choise of reason, but wyth false opinyon by the longinge of sense. Wherupon the pleasure that foloweth it, is also false and of necessytye full of erroures.They that loue sensuallye. And therefore into one of the two vyces renn all those louers that satisfye theyr vnhonest lustes with the women whom they loue: For eyther assone as they be come to the coueted ende, they not onely feels a fulnesse and lothesomnesse, but also conceyue a hatred against the wyght beloued, as thoughe longinge repented hym of hys offence and acknowleaged the deceite wrought hym by the false iudgement of sense, that made hym beleaue the yll to be good: or elles they contynue in the verye same couetynge and greedynesse, as thought they were not in deede come to the ende, whyche they sought for. And albeit throughe the blynde opynyon that




hath made them dronken (to their seeminge) in that instante they feele a contentation, as the deseased otherwhile, that dreame they drinke of some cleare spring, yet be they not satisfied, nor leaue of so. And bicause of possessing coueted goodnes there arriseth alwayes quietnesse and satisfaction in the possessors minde, in case this were the true and righte end of there couetinge, whan they possesse it they would be at quietnesse and throughlye satisfied, whiche they be not: but rather deceyued through that likenesse, they furthwith retourn again to vnbridled couetinge, and with the very same trouble which they felt at the first, they fall again into the raginge and most burninge thirst of the thinge, that they hope in vaine to possesse perfectlye. These kind of louers therfore loue most vnluckely, for eyther they neuer comebye their couetinges, whiche is a great vnluckinesse: or elles if they do comebye them, they finde they comebye their hurt, and ende their myseryes with other greater miseries, for both in the beginninge and middle of this loue, there is neuer other thing felt, but afflictions, tourmentes, greeffes,Properties of louers. pining, trauaile, so that to be wann, vexed with continuall teares, and sighes, to lyue with a discontented minde, to be alwaies dumbe, or to lament, to couet death, in conclusion to be most vnlucky are the propreties which (they saye) beelonge to louers. The cause therfore of this wretchednesse in mens mindes, is principally sense, whiche in youthfull age bereth moste swey, bicause the lustinesse of the fleshe and of the bloode, in that season addeth vnto him euē so much force, as it withdraweth from reason: therfore doeth it easelye traine the soule to folowe appetite or longinge, for when she seeth her selfe drowned in the earthly prison, bicause she is sett in the office to gouern the body, she can not of her self vnderstand plainly at the first the truth of spirituall behouldinge. Wherfore to cōpasse the vnderstāding of thinges, she must go begg the beginning at the senses, & therfore she beleaueth them, &




giueth ear to them, and is contented to be lead by them, especiallye whan they haue so much courage, that (in a ma
               
                  •
               er) they enforce her & bicause they be deceitfull they fyll her with errours and false opinions. Wherupon most cō
               munlye it happeneth, that yonge men be wrapped in this sensual loue, which is a very rebell against reason, & therfore thei make them selues vnwoorthy to enioy the fauoures and benifites, which loue bestoweth vpon his true subiectes, neither in loue feele they any other pleasures, then what beastes wtout reason do, but much more greuous afflictions. Setting case therfore this to be so, which is most true, I say, that the contrary chaunseth to them of a more ripe age. For in case they, whan the soule is not nowe so much wayed downe with the bodyly burdein, & whan the naturall burning asswageth & draweth to a warmeth, if thei be inflamed with beawty, & to it bend their coueting guided by reasonable choise, they be not deceiued, and possesse beawtye perfectly, and therefor through the possessing of it, alwaies goodnes ensueth to them:Beawtie bicause beauty is good & consequently the true loue of it is most good & holy, and euermore bringeth furth good frutes in the soules of them, that with the bridle of reason restraine the yll disposition of sense, the which old men can much sooner do then yong. Yt is not therfore out of reason to say, that olde men may also loue without sclaunder and more happily, then yong men: taking notwithstanding this name Olde, not for the age at the pittes brincke, nor when the canelles of the body be so feble, that ye soule can not through them worke her feates, but when knowleage in vs is in his right strength. And I wil not also hide this from you: namely, that I suppose, where sensuall loue in euery age is naught, yet in yonge men it deserueth excuse, & perhappes in some case lefull: for although it putteth them in afflictions, daūgeres, traua
                  •
               les, & ye vnfortunatenes that is said, yet are there many yt to winne them the good will of their Ladies practise vertuous thinges, which for all they




be not bent to a good end, yet are they good of them selues, and so of that much bitternesse they pike out a litle sweetnesse, and through the aduersities which they susteine, in the ende they acknowleage their errour. As I iudge therfore those yong men that bridle their appetites, and loue with reason, to be godlye: so do I houlde excused suche as yelde to sensuall loue, wherunto they be so inclined through the weakenesse and frailtie of man: so they showe therin meekenesse, courtesie: and prowesse, and the other worthie condicions that these Lordes haue spoken of, and whan those youthfull yeeres be gone and past, leaue it of cleane, keapinge alouf from this sensuall couetinge as from the lowermost steppe of the stayers, by the whiche a man may ascende to true loue. But in case after they drawe in yeeres once they reserue still in their colde hart the fire of appetites, and brynge stoute reason in subiection to feeble sense, it can not bee said how much they are to be blamed: for lyke men without sense they deserue with an euerlastinge shame to be put in the numbre of vnreasonable liuing creatures, bicause the thoughtes and wayes of sensuall loue be farr vnsittinge for ripe age. Here Bembo paused a while as though he woulde brethe him, and whan all thinges were whist M. Morello of Ortona saide: And in case there were some olde man more freshe and lustye and of a better complexion then manye yonge men, whie woulde you not haue it lefull for him to loue with the loue that yonge men loue? The Dutchesse laughed and said: yf the loue of yong men be so vnluckye, why would you (M. Morello) that old men should also loue with this vnluckinesse? But in case you were old (as these men say you be) you woulde not thus procure the hurt of olde men. M. Morello answered: The hurt of olde men (me seemeeh (M. Peter Bembo procureth, who will haue them to loue after a sort, that I for my part vnderstande not: and (me think) the possessing of this beawtye, whiche he prayseth so muche, without the body, is a dreame. Do you beeleaue




               M. Morello, ꝙ then Count Lewis, that beauty is alwaies so good a thing as M. Peter Bembo speaketh of? Not I in good sooth, answered M. Morello: But I remēbre rather that I haue seene manie beautifull women of a most yll inclination, cruell, and spitefull, and it seemeth that (in a maner (it happeneth alwaies so, for beawtie maketh them proude: and pride, cruell. Count Lewis said smilinge: To you perhappes they seeme cruell, bicause they cōtent you not with it, that you would haue. But cause M. Peter Bembo to teach you in what sort old men ought to couet beawtye and what to seeke at their Ladies handes, and what to content them selues withall: and in not passinge out of these boundes, ye shal se that they shal be neither proud nor cruell: and wil satisfy you with what you shal require M.

this hapinesse of loue, for I will not care to be counted olde, so it may profit me. M· Peter Bembo laughed and said: first will I take ye errour out of these gentilmens minde: and afterwarde will I satisfie you also. So beeginning a fresh, my Lordes (quoth he) I would not that with spea: kynge ill of beawtie, which is a holy thinge, any of vs as prophane and wicked shoulde purchase him the wrath of God.A notable Poet whiche lost his sight for writing against Helena and recanting, had his sight restored him again. Therfore to giue M. Morello and Sir Fridericke warninge, that they lose not their sight, as Stesichorus did, a peine most meete for who so dispraiseth beawtie, I saye, that beawtie commeth of God, and is like a circle, the goodnesse wherof is the Centre. And therefore, as there can be no circle without a centre, no more can beawty be without goodnesse. Wherupon doeth verie sildome an ill soule dwell in a beawtifull bodye. And therefore is the outwarde beawtie a true signe of the inwarde goodnes, and in bodies thys comelynesse is imprynted more and lesse (as it were) for a marke of the soule, whereby she is outwardlye knowen: as in trees, in whiche the beawtye of the buddes giueth a testimonie of the goodnesse of the frute.

Beeside other thinges therfore, it giueth a great praise to the world, in saiynge that it is beawtifull. It is praised, in saiynge, the beawtifull heauen, beawtifull earth, beawtifull sea, beawtifull riuers, beawtifull wooddes, trees, gardeines, beawtifull Cities, beawtifull Churches, houses, armies. In conclusion this comelye and holye beawtie is a wonderous settinge out of euerie thinge. And it may be said that Good and beawtifull be after a sort one selfe thinge, especiallie in the bodies of men: of the beawtie wherof the nighest cause (I suppose) is the beawtie of the soule: the which as a partner of the right and heauenlye beawtie, maketh sightlye and beawtifull what euer she toucheth, and most of all, if the bodye, where she dwelleth, be not of so vile a matter, that she can not imprint in it her propertye. Therfore Beawtie▪
                is the true monument & spoile of the victorye of the soule, whan she with heauenlye influence beareth rule ouer materiall and grosse nature, and with her light ouercommeth the darkeness of the bodye. It is not then to be spoken that Beawtie maketh women proude or cruel, although it seeme so to M. Morello. Neyther yet ought beawtifull women to beare the blame of that hatred, mortalytie, and destruction, which the vnbridled




appetites of men are the cause of. I will not nowe denye, but it is possible also to finde in the worlde beawtifull women vnchast, yet not bicause beawtie inclineth them to vnchast liuinge, for it rather plucketh them from it, and leadeth them into the way of vertuous condicions, throughe the affinitie that beawtie hath with goodnesse: But otherwhile yll bringinge vp, the continuall prouocations of louers, tokens, pouertie, hope, deceites, feare, and a thousande other matters ouercome the steadfastnesse, yea of beawtifull and good women: and for these and like causes may also beawtifull menn beecome wicked. Then said the L. Cesar: In case the L Gaspar

                sayinge be true of yesternight, there is no doubt but the faire women be more chast then the foule. And what was my sayinge, quoth the L. Gaspar? The L. Cesar answered: If I do well beare in minde, your saiynge was, that The women that are suide to, alwaies refuse to satisfie him that suith to them, but those that are not suide to, sue to others. There is no doubt but the beautiful women haue alwaies more suyters, and be more instantlye laide at in loue, then the foule. Therefore the beawtifull alwayes deny, and consequentlye be more chast, then the foule, whiche not beeinge suied to, sue vnto others. M. Peter Bembo laughed and said: This argument can not be answered to. Afterwarde he proceaded. It chaunseth also oftentimes, that as the other senses, so the sight is deceyued, and iudgeth a face beawtyfull, which in deede is not beawtifull.

more of this loue and of the waye to enioy beautye aright, and at the last, Me thinke (quoth he) I haue showed plainly inough, that Olde men may loue more happelye then yonge, whiche was my drift, therfore it belongeth not me to entre anye farther. Count Lewes answered: You haue better declared the vnluckinesse of yonge men, then the happynesse of olde menn, whom you haue not as yet taught, what waye they must folow in this loue of theirs: onelye you haue saide, that they must suffre them selues to bee guided by reason, and the opinion of many is, that it is vnpossible for loue to stand with reason. Bembo notwithstanding saught to make an ende of reasoning, but the Dutchesse desired him to say on, and he beegane thus afreshe: Too vnluckie were the nature of man, if oure soule (in the whiche this so feruent couetinge may lightlie arrise) should be driuen to nourish it with that onelye,Sense. whiche is commune to her with beastes, and coulde not tourn it to the other noble parte,Reason. whiche is propre to her. Therfore sins it is so your pleasure: I wil not refuse to reason vpon this noble matter. And bicause I know my self vnworthy to talke of the most holye misteries of loue, I beseche him to leade my thought and my tunge so, that I may show this excelent Courtier how to loue contrarye to the wonted maner of the commune ignorant sort. And euen as from my childhode I haue dedicated all my wholl lief vnto him, so also now that my wordes may be answerable to the same intent, and to the prayse of him: I say therfore, that sins the nature of man in youthfull age is so much inclined to sense, it may be graunted the Courtier, while he is yong, to loue sensuallye. But in case afterwarde also in hys riper yeres, he chaūse to be set on fire with this coueting of loue, he ought to be good & circumspect, & heedful that he beeguyle not him self, to be lead willfullye into the wretchednesse, that in yonge men deserueth more to be pitied then blamed: and contrarywise in olde men, more to be blamed then pitied. Therfore whan an amiable




countenance of a beautiful woman commeth in his sight, that is accompanied with noble condicions and honest behauiours, so that as one practised in loue, he wotteth well that his hewe hath an agreement with herres, assoone as he is a ware that his eyes snatch that image and carie it to the hart, and that the soule beeginneth to beehoulde it with pleasure, and feeleth within her self the influence that stirreth her and by litle and litle setteth her in heate, and that those liuelye spirites, that twinkle out throughe the eyes, put continually freshe nourishment to the fire: he ought in this beginninge to seeke a speedye remedye and to raise vp reason, and with her, to fense the fortresse of his hart, and to shutt in such wise the passages against sense and appetites, that they maye entre neyther with force nor subtill practise.

But in case it continue or encrease, then must the Courtier determine (when he perceiueth he is taken) to shonn throughlye all filthinesse of commune loue, and so entre into the holye way of loue with the guide of reason, and first consider that the body, where that beawtye shyneth, is not the fountaine frome whens beauty springeth, but rather bicause beautie is bodilesse and (as we haue said) an heauenlie shyning beame, she loseth much of her honoure whan she is coopled with that vile subiect and full of corruption,Beawtye seuered fro

And as a mann heareth not with his mouth, nor smelleth with hys eares: no more can he also in anye maner wise enioye beawtye, nor satisfye the desyre that shee stirrith vp in oure myndes, with feelynge, but wyth the sense, vnto whom beawtye is the verye butt to leuell at: namelye, the vertue of seeinge. Let him laye aside therefore the blinde iudgemente of the sense, and inioye wyth his eyes the bryghtnesse, the comelynesse, the louynge sparkles, laughters, gestures and all the other




pleasant fournitours of beawty: especially with hearinge the sweetenesse of her voice, the tunablenesse of her woordes, the melodie of her singinge and playinge on instrumētes (in case the woman beloued be a musitien) and so shall he with most d

Afterward let him obey, please, and honoure with all reuerence his woman, and recken her more deere to him then his owne lief, and prefarr all her commodites and pleasures beefore his owne, and loue no lesse in her the beauty of the mind, then of the bodye: Therfore let him haue a care not to suffer her to renn into any errour, but with lessons and good exhortations seeke alwaies to frame her to modestie, to temperance, to true honestye, and so to woorke that there maye neuer take place in her other then pure thoughtes and farr wide from all filthinesse of vices. And thus in sowinge of vertue in the gardein of that mind, he shall also gather the frutes of most beautifull condicions, and sauour them with a marueilous good relise. And this shall be the right engendringe and imprinting of beawtye in beawtie, the which

Peter Bembo laughed and said: You must not (M. Morello) passe your boundes. I may tell you, it is not a small token that a woman loueth, whan she giueth vnto her louer her beawtye, which is so precious a matter: and by the wayes that be a passage to the soule (that is to say, the sight and the hearinge) sendeth the lookes of her eyes, the image of her countenance, and the voice of her woordes, that perce into the louers hart, and giue a witnes of her loue. M. Morello said: Lookes and woordes may be, and oftentimes are, false witnesses. Therfore whoso hath not a better pledge of loue (in my iudgement) he is in an yll assurance. And surelye I looked still that you would haue made this woman of yours somewhat more courteyous and free towarde the Courtier, then my L. Iulian hath made his: but (me seemeth) ye be both of the propretie of those iudges, that (to appeere wise) giue sētence against their owne. Bembo said: I am well pleased to haue this woman muche more courteyous towarde my Courtier not yonge, then the L. Iulians is to the yong: and that with good reason, bicause mine coueteth but honest matters, and therfore may the woman graunt him them all without blame. But my L, Iulians woman that is not so assured of the modestye of the yonge man, ought to graūt him the honest matters onlye, and denye him the dishonest. Therefore more happye is mine, that hath graunted him whatsoeuer he requireth, then the other, that hath parte graunted and parte denyed. And bicause you may moreouer the better vnderstande, that reasonable loue is more happye then sensuall, I saye vnto you, that self same thinges in sensuall ought to be denyed otherwhile, and in reasonable, graunted: bicause in the one, they be honest, and in the other dishonest. Therfore ye woman to please her good louer, beside the graunting him merie coūtenances, familiar & secret talke, iesting, dalying, hand in hand, may also lawfullye




and without blame come to kissinge: whiche in sensuall loue, accordinge to the L. Iulians rules, is not lefull. For sins a kisse is a knitting together both of body and soule,

Wherupon a kisse may be said to be rather a cooplinge together of the soule, then of the bodye, bicause it hath suche force in her, that it draweth her vnto it, and (as it were) seperateth her from the bodye. For this do all chast louers couett a kisse, as a cooplinge of soules together. And therfore Plato the diuine louer saith, that in kissing, his soule came as farr as his lippes to depart out of the body. And bicause the separatinge of the soule from the matters of the sense and the through coopling her with matters of vnderstanding may be beetokened by a kisse, Salomon saith in his heauenlye boke of Balattes, Oh that he would kisse me with a kisse of his mouth, to expresse the desire he had, that hys soule might be rauished through heauenly loue to the behouldinge of heauenly beawtie in such maner, that cooplyng her self inwardly with it, she might forsake the body.

And where no other inconuenience insueth vpon it, ones absence from the wight beloued carieth a great passion with it: bicause the influence of that beawtie whan it is present, giueth a wonderous delite to the louer, and settinge his hart on fire, quickeneth and melteth certein vertues in a traunce and congeled in the soule, the which nourished with the heat of loue, floow about and go bubbling nigh the hart, and thrust out through the eyes those spirites, whiche be most fyne vapoures made of the purest and cleerest part of the bloode, which receiue the image of beawtie, and decke it with a thousande sundrye fournitures. Wherupon the soule taketh a delite, and with a certein wonder is agast, and yet enioyeth she it, and (as it were) astonied together with the pleasure, feeleth the feare and reuerence that men accustomably haue towarde holy matters, and thinketh her self to be in paradise. The louer therfore that considereth only the beawtie in the bodye, loseth this treasure and happinesse, assoone as the woman beloued with her departure leaueth the eyes without their brightnes, and consequently the soule, as a widowe without her ioye. For sins beawtie is farr of, that influence of loue setteth not the hart on fire, as it did in presence. Wherupon the pores be dryed vp and wythered, and yet doeth the remembraunce of beawty somwhat stirr those vertues of the soule in such wise, that they seeke to scattre abrode the spirites, and they fyndinge the wayes closed vp, haue no yssue, and still they seeke to gete out, and so with those shootinges inclosed

And thus in steade of goinge out of his witt with thought, as he must do that will consider the bodilye beawty, he may come into his witt, to behoulde the beawty that is seene with the eyes of the minde, which then beegin to be sharpe and thorough seeinge, whan the eyes of the body lose the floure of their sightlynesse. Therfore the soule rid of vices, purged with the studyes of true Philosophie, occupied in spirituall, and exercised in matters of vnderstandinge, tourninge her to the beehouldyng of her owne substance, as it were raysed out of a most deepe sleepe, openeth the eyes that all men haue, and fewe occupy, and seeth in her self a shining beame of that lyght, which is the true image of the aungelike beawtye partened with her, whereof she also partneth with the bodye a feeble shadowe: Therfore wered blinde about earthlye matters, is made most quicke of sight about heauenlye. And otherwhile whan the stirringe vertues of the body are withdrawen alone through earnest behouldinge, eyther fast bounde through sleepe, whan she is not hindred by them, she feeleth a certein preuie smell of the right aungelike beawtie, and rauished with the shining of that light, beeginneth to be inflamed, and so greedilye foloweth after, that (in a maner) she wereth dronken and beeside her self, for coueting to coople her self with it, hauinge founde (to her wening) the footesteppes of God, in the beehouldinge of whom (as in her happy end) she seeketh to settle her self. And therfore burninge in this most happye flame, she arryseth to the noblest part of her (which is the vnderstanding)

For like as throughe the perticular beawtye of one bodye he guydeth her to the vniuersall beawtye of all bodies: Euenso in the last degree of perfection throughe perticular vnderstandinge he guideth her to the vniuersall vnderstandinge. Thus the soule kindled in the most holye fire of true heauenlye loue, fleeth to coople her selfe with the nature of Aungelles, and not onlye cleane forsaketh sense, but hath no more neede of the discourse of reason, for being chaunged into an Aungell, she vnderstandeth all thinges that may be vnderstoode: and without any veile or cloude, she seeth the meine sea of the pure heauenlye beawtye and receiueth it into her, and enioyeth that soueraigne happinesse, that can not be comprehended of the senses. Sins therfore the beawties, which we dayly see with these our dimm eyes in bodies subiect to corruption, that neuerthelesse be nothinge elles but dreames and most thinne shadowes of beauty, seme vnto vs so wel fauoured and comely, that oftentimes they kendle in vs a most burning fire, and with such delite, that we recken no happinesse may be compared to it, that we feele otherwhile through the only looke which the beloued coūtenance of a woman casteth at vs: what happy wonder

So much therfore is this loue greater and happier then others, as the cause that stirreth it, is more excellent.

Peter) that these thoughtes make not your soule also to forsake the bodye. Madam, answered M. Peter, it shoulde not be the first miracle that loue hath wrought in me. Then the Dutchesse and all the rest beegan a fresh to be instant vpon M. Bembo that he woulde procc

one thought he felt in his minde (as it were) a certein sparkle of that godlye loue that pricked him, and they all coueted to heare farther: but M. Bembo, My Lordes (quoth he) I haue spoken what the holye furie of loue hath (vnsaught for) indited to me: now that (it seemeth) he inspireth me no more, I wot not what to say. And I thinke verelie that loue will not haue his secretes discouered any farther, nor that the Courtier shoulde passe the degree that his pleasure is I shoulde show him, and therfore it is not perhappes lefull to speak anye more in this matter. Surelye, quoth the Dutchesse, if the not yonge Courtier be such a one that he can folowe this way which you haue showed him, of right he ought to be satisfied with so great a happines, and not to enuie the yonger. Then the L. Cesar Gonzaga, the way (ꝙ he) that leadeth to this happines is so stiepe (in my mind) that (I beleaue) it will be much a do to gete to it. The L. Gaspar said: I beleaue it be harde to gete vp for men, but vnpossible for women. The L. Emilia laughed and said: If ye fall so often to offende vs, I promise you, ye shall be no more forgiuen. The L. Gaspar answered: It is no offence to you, in saiynge, that womens soules be not so pourged from passions as mens be, nor accustomed in behouldinges, as M. Peter hath said, is necessary for them to be, that will tast of the heauenly loue. Therefore it is not read that euer woman hath had this grace: but manie men haue had it, as Plato, Socrates, Plotinus, and manie other: and a numbre of our holye fathers, as Saint Francis, in whom a feruent spirite of loue imprinted the most holie seale of the fiue woundes. And nothinge but the vertue of loue coulde hale vp Saint Paul the Apostle to the sight of those secretes, which is not lawfull for man to speake of: nor show Saint Stephan the heauens open. Here answered the L. Iulian: In this point men shall nothinge passe women, for Socrates him selfe doeth confesse that all the misteries of loue which he knew, were oped vnto him by a woman, which was Diotima.




Diotima. And the Aungell that with the fire of loue imprinted the fiue woundes in Saint Francis, hath also made some women woorthy of the same print in our age. You must remembre moreouer that S. Mari Magdalen had manye faultes forgeuen her, bicause she loued muche: and perhappes with no lesse grace then Saint Paul, was she manye times through Aungelyke loue haled vp to the thirde heauen. And manye other (as I showed you yesterdaye more at large) that for loue of the name of Chryst
                  •
                haue not passed vpon lief, nor feared tourmentes, nor any other kinde of death how terrible and cruell euer it were. And they were not (as M. Peter wyll haue his Courtier to be) aged, but soft and tender maidens, and in the age, when he saith that sensuall loue ought to be borne withal in men. The L. Gaspar began to prepare himself to speake, but the Dutchesse, Of this (quoth shee) let M. Peter be iudge, and the matter shal stand to his verdite, whether women be not as meete for heauenlie loue▪ as men. But bicause the pleade beetweene you may happen be to longe, it shall not be amisse to deferr it vntill to morow. Nay, to nyght, quoth the L. Cesar Gonzaga. And how can it be to night, quoth the Dutchesse? The L. Cesar answered: Bicause it is daye alreadye, and showed her the light that beegane to entre in at the cliftes of the windowes, Then euerie man arrose vpon his feete with much wonder, bicause they had not thaught that the reasoninges had lasted l

And not one of them felt any heauinesse of slepe in his eyes, the which often happeneth whan a man is vp after his accustomed houre to go to bed. Whan the windowes then were opened on the side of the Palaice that hath his prospect toward the high to

of the hilles at hande. Wherupon they all, takinge their leaue with reuerence of the Dutchesse, departed toward their lodginges without torche, the light of the day sufficing. And as they were now passing out at the great chambre doore, the L. Generall tourned hym to the Dutches, and said: Madam, to take vp the variance beetweene the L. Gaspar and the L. Iulian, we will assemble this night with the iudge sooner then we did yesterdaye. The Lady Emilia answered, vpon condicion, that in case my L. Gaspar wyll accuse women, and geue them (as his wont is) some false reporte, he wil also put vs in suretye to stand to triall, for I recken him a waueringe starter.

            A letter that the Author vvritt to the Lady Victoria Columna Marquess of Pescara, vvhom he mentioneth in the Epistle before his booke.
            
               MOST HONORABLE AND MY VERIE good Lady. I am much behouldinge to M. Thomas Tuke, bicause he was the occasion that your Ladishipp hath vouchsafed to write vnto me: which is most acceptable to me, and not without cause, consideringe I haue written so manye letters and coulde neuer receiue anye answere from you again, albeit they conteined sundrye matters. Truth it is indeede, that vnmeete it were your L. shoulde write vnto me, onlesse therewithall you vsed my seruice and commaunded me in what I am able to do for you. As touchinge M, Tuke, I will do as much for him, as shall lie in me to doe, both for your L. sake that may commaunde me, and for the brotherlye loue that I beare him. Where M. Gutteriz hath wrytten vnto you that I complayned of you, I wonder nothinge at it, for (to saye the troth) I vttred my greef a good while sins in a letter that I wrott vnto you your self, as I passed the mountaignes of Fraunce to come into Spaine. And he that toulde me the matter that caused it, was my L. Marquesse of Vasto, who showed me a letter of yours, in the which you your self confessed the stelth of the Courtyer. The whyche thynge I as then tooke in great good part, doubtynge nothynge 
                  •
               ut that it shoulde remayne in youre handes, and be well kept vntyll I my self shoulde come to demaunde it of you.




At the last I was enfourmed by a Gentilman Neapolitan, who continueth still here in Spaine, that there were certein Fragmentes of the poore Courtier in Naples, and he sawe them in the handes of sundrye men, and he that scattered it thus abrode reported that he had it of you. It was some greef to me, as a father that seeth hys chylde so yll handled: yet afterward yeeldyng to reason, I knewe he deserued not to haue anye more store made of him, but (like an vntymelye birth) to be left in the hygh waye for the benifit of nature. And so vndoubtedly was I determined to do, consideringe yf there were any thinge in the Booke not yll, men woulde haue the woorse opinion of it, whan they shoulde see it so out of order. And no diligence shoulde preuaile any more to poolish it and to sett it furth, sins it had lost the thyng, which perhappes at the first was onlye it, that made it esteamed: that is to weete, the noueltye of the matter. And knowinge your saiynge to be true, that the cause of my complaint was verye triflynge, I resolued wyth my selfe, to leaue at the least my complaininge, though I coulde not my sorowynge. And that whyche I brake wyth M. Gutteriz (in case it be well wayed) was no complaint. In conclusion others, more bent of a zeale then I was, haue enforced me to write hym ouer again, as the shortnesse of tyme hath serued me, and to sende hym to Venice to be put in print, and so haue I done. But if your L. shoulde suspect that the good will whiche I beare you were any deale feinted for this, your iudgement shoulde deceyue you, whiche (I beleaue) it did neuer in all youre lief beefore: but rather I recken my selfe more bounde to you, bicause the necessity that droue me to make hast so spedilie to imprint it, hath saued me a great peece of labour, where I was once mynded to haue added manye other matters, which coulde be but of small moment as the rest are. And thus shall the reader haue the lesse labour and the Author lesse blame.




Therefore it is nowe past time eyther for you or me to repent or correct. And thus I take my leaue of you.
