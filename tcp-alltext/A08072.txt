               ❧A diſcourſe of the
preſent ſtate of the Wars
in the lowe Countryes.
            
               Wherein is contayned
the pittifull Spoyle of Askot:
And the Articles of Peace to
bee concluded betweene the
States, and Don Iohn de
Auſtrea.
            
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            ¶The pitifull Spoyle of
Aſkot, by Don Ioan
de Auſtria.
            
               
                  I Maye not ſeeme ſo
vngratefull vnto
you my louinge
freinde, in recompence
of your gret
benefites which I
haue ſūdry waies
receiued from you, as not to certifie
you of all ſuch occurantes as here
are reddy paſt. But from time to
time, God lending me life, I minde
ſtill as iuſt occaſion ſhall ſerue to
ſignifye vnto you how things here
ſhall paſſe. You vnderſtand that on
the ſyxt day of this moneth of Auguſt,

howe that the Vicount of
Gaunt (vnderſtanding that Don
Iohn his forces were retired towardes
Louin) beſeeged Askot
with three thouſande Souldiers
and 2. great peeces of Ordinance,
and put to the Sworde 200. Alboneys,
and 500. Almaynes and VVallons,
Souldiours, who were there
in gariſon, which when the Vicunt
of Gaunt (had by the valiancye of
Engliſh men and the Sckots ſlayne
ſo many before ſpecifyed) gaue commaundement
that neither Burger
nor Inhabitant ſhould be hurt, onlye
their goodes and munition for
warre, whoſe commaundemente
was accompliſhed, and as it is ſurely
notifyed that the ſpoyle of that
Towne is valued too bee better
worth to the Souldyers then fyue
thowſande pownde, although the
ſame Towne was but of very ſmal
countenaunce. When this exployte

by our Countrymen was fyniſhed
they returned too their Campe agayne:
Whiche when Don Ihoan
had intelligence heereof, hee went
in parſon to view the ſame,
and found as before is mencioned,
being all bent with furye for that
whiche had happened, gaue commaundement
to kyll men, women,
and Children, which was a great
number, and a ſorrowful ſight. Yet
notwithſtanding he was not ſo pacifyed,
but alſo cauſed the Towne
to be burnt & vtterly defaced to the
ground. Thus my beloued I haue
certifyed you of the vtter ruine of
this little Towne.
            And furthermore, to let you vnderſtande,
that on wedneſday laſt,
our Ambaſſadors departed from
Machelen towardes Don Iohn, accompanied
with certayne Lordes
of the Countrey, for the concluſion
of a Peace (if it maye be) according

to certayne Articles which I ſende
you herewith.
            We heare not yet what is effected,
a murmor of Peace here runneth.
But yet greatly doubted: and
that all is but practizes, and the
French thought to be all one with
Don Iohn.
            
            The French Ambaſſador is returned,
but not hearde what hee
hath brought with him for newes,
being thought his comming to bee
rather to get ſome concluſion of his
meſſage, for the which he came
fyrſt for his maiſter, to the ende he
might be diſpatched, then otherwyſe
to venter him ſelfe longer
here, fearing the ſmoother and
ſmooke is ſo ſore ſeene and ſmelte,
as the flame muſt needes ere long,
burſt out.
            The Duke Allonſon floryſheth
at Mons, where he hath feaſted all
the Nobles and Gentlemen. That

place is ſure inough for him: other
Townes in Henego, wyll not yet
accept of him.
            In Valencine (as men report) they
haue bene in Armes, and fought
together, but wherefore, or who
haue gotten the better, is not yet
here certainly knowen.
            
               Caſſimerus is now in the Campe
with his Forces, where the Archduke
Mathias hath bene: And hee
met Caſſimerus before Leyre, and
ſo returned to the Towne, and dyned
together.
            Nowe it is thought, that the
Campe ſhall preſentlie marche, eyther
to the ſyege of ſome Towne,
that Don Iohn holdeth, or elſe to
follow his ſorces, vntyll they meete
with him.
            There is money, Municion, and
all other kinde of Furniture, ſent to
the Campe of the States to maintaine

the Souldiors the better.
            
               Don Iohn for certayne, hath a
great number of Spaniardes, and Italians,
comming vnto him, which
by reporte hath bene ſeene Marching
in Piemont, and are about
ryght, or ten thouſande.

            ¶The Articles which are

            The States in generall, and
particular, ſhall holde and keepe

            Thoſe of Burgondy and Luxenbaurge
               
ſhall be bounde to mayntayne
the pacifycation of Gaunt.
            
            Touching the Religion, men
ſhall gouerne them ſelues after the
beſt manner as ſhall be poſſyble,
accordinge to the neceſſytie of the
Countreyes, and Prouinces ſhall
requyre.
            An Pryſoners to bee releaſed.

confederated, ſhall be comprehended
in the Peace.
