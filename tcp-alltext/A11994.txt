               Thou art a traitour and a miscreant,
               Too good to be so, and too bad to liue,

               Let not my cold wordes here accuse my zeale,

               The bloud is hote that must be coold for this,
               Yet can I not of such tame patience boast,
               As to be huisht, and naught at all to say.
               First the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbs me,
               From giuing reines and spurtes to my free speech,

               Setting aside his high blouds royaltie,
               
                  
And let him be no kinsman to my Liege,
               I do defie him, and I spit at him,
               Call him a slaunderous coward, and a villaine,
               Which to maintaine, I would allow him ods,
               And meete him were I tied to runne afoote,
               Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,
               Or any other ground inhabitable,
               Where ouer Englishman durst set his foote,
               Meane time, let this defend my loyaltie,
               By all my hopes most falsly doth he lie.

               For sleeping England long time haue I watcht,
               Watching breedes leanenesse, leanenesse is all gaunt:
               The pleasure that some fathers feede vpon
               Is my strict fast; I meane my childrens lookes,
               And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt:
               Gaunt am I for the graue, gaunt as a graue,
               Whose hollow wombe inherites naught but bones.

               No misery makes sport to mocke it selfe,
               Since thou dost seeke to kill my name in me.
               I mocke my name (great King) to flatter thee.
            
            
               King
               Should dying men flatter with those that liue?
            
            
               Gaunt
               No no, men liuing flatter those that die.

               Now he that made me knowes I see thee ill,
               Ill in my selfe to see, and in thee, seeing ill.
               Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,
               Wherein thou liest in reputation sicke,
               And thou too carelesse pacient as thou art
               Commitst thy annoynted body to the cure
               Of those Physitions that first wounded thee,
               A thousand flatterers sit within thy Crowne,
               Whose compasse is no bigger than thy head,
               And yet inraged in so small a verge,
               The waste is no whit lesser than thy land:

               Seene how his sonnes sonne should destroy his sonnes.
               From forth thy reach he would haue laid thy shame.
               Deposing thee before thou wert possest,
               Which art possest now to depose thy selfe:
               Why cousin wert thou regent of the world.
               It were a shame to let this land by lease:
               But for thy world enioying but this land,
               Is it not more than shame to shame it so?

               Making the hard way sweete and delectable,
               
                  But I bethinke me what a weary way
               From Rauenspurgh to Cotshall will be found,
               In Rosse and Wilsoughby wanting your company,

               The tediousnesse and processe of my trauell:
               But theirs is sweetned with the hope to haue
               The present benefit which I pessesse.
               And hope to ioy is little lesse in ioye,
               Then hope enioyed: by this the weary Lords
               Shall make their way seeme short as mine hath done,
               By sight of what I haue, your noble company.

               And sent me ouer by Barckly to discouer,
               What power the Duke of Yorke had leuied there,
               Then with directions to repaire to Rauenspurgh.

               I neuer in my life did looke on him.

               I thanke thee gentle Persy, and be sure.

               To execute the noble Duke at Callice.

               Why Yorke what wilt thou doe?
               Wilt thou not hide the trespasse of thine owne?
               Haue we more sons? or are we like to haue?
               Is not my teeming date drunke vp with time?
               And wilt thou plucke my faire sonne from mine age?
               And rob me of a happie mothers name,
               Is he not like the? is he not thine owne?

               Thou fond mad woman,
               Wilt thou conceale this darke conspiracie?
               A doozen of them here haue tane the sacrament:
               And interchaungeably set downe there hands,
               To kill the king at Oxford.
            
            
               Du.
               He shal be none, weele keepe him heere,
               Then what is that to him?

               Away fond woman, were he twentie times my sonne.
               I would appeach him.
            
            
               Du.
               Hadst thou groand for him as I haue done,
               Thou wouldst bee more pittifull.
               But nowe I knowe rhy minde, thou doest suspect
               That I haue been disloiall to thy bed,
               And that he is a bastard, not thy sonne:
               Sweete Yorke, sweete husband, be not of that mind,
               He is as like thee as a man may be,
               Not like to me, or any of my kinne,
               And yet I loue him.

               After Aumerle: mount thee vpon his horse,
               Spur, post, and get before him to the King,
               And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee,
               Ile not be long behind, though I be old,
               
                  
I doubt not but to ride as fast as Yorke.
               An neuer will I rise vp from the ground,
               Till Bullingbroke haue pardoned thee: away, be gone.

               His answer was, he would vnto the stews,

               And weare it as a fauour, and with that,

               Rich.
               I haue beene studying how I may compare
               This prison where I liue, vnto the world:
               And forbecause the world is populous,
               And here is not a creature but my selfe,
               I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer it out,
               My braine Ile prooue, the female to my soule,
               My soule the father, and these two beget
               A generation of still-breeding thoughts:
               And these same thoughts people this little world,
               In humors like the people of this world:
               For no thought is contented: the better sort,
               As thoughts of things diuine are intermixt
               With scruples, and do set the word it selfe
               Against the word, as thus: Come little ones, & then againe
               It is as hard to come, as for a Cammell
               To threed the posterne of a small needles eie:
               Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot,
               
                  
Vnlikely wonders: how these vaine weake nailes
               May teare a passage thorow the flinty ribs
               Of this hard world my ragged prison walles:
               And for they cannot die in their owne pride,
               Thoughts tending to content flatter themselues,
               That they are not the first of fortunes slaues,
               Nor shall not be the last like seely beggars,
               Who

               And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
               Bearing their owne misfortunes on the backe
               Of such as haue before indurde the like.

               Then treasons make me wish my selfe a beggar,
               And so I am: then crushing penurie
               Perswades me I was better when a king,
               Then am I kingd againe, and by and by,

               Had not an eare to heare my true time broke,
               I wasted time, and now doth time waste me:
               For now hath time made me his numbring clocke;
               My thoughts are minutes, and with sighes they iarre,
               Their watches on vnto mine eyes the outward watch

               I was a poore groome of thy stable King,
               When thou wert King: who trauailling towards Yorke,
               With much adoe (at length) haue gotten leaue,
               To looke vpon my sometimes roiall maisters face:
               Oh how it ernd my hart when I beheld,
               In London streetes, that Corronation day,
               When Bullingbroke rode on Roane Barbarie,
               That horse, that thou so often hast bestride.
               That horse, that I so carefully haue drest.

               Rode he on Barbarie, tell me gentle freind,

               So proud that Bullingbroke was on his backe:
               That Iade hath eate bread from my royall hand,
               This hand hath made him proud with clapping him:
               Would he not stumble, would he not fall downe
               Since pride must haue a fal; and breake the necke,
               Of that prond man, that did vsurpe his backe?

               Choose out some secret place, some reuerent roome
               More than thou bast, and with it ioy thy life:
               So as thou liu'st in peace, die free from strife,
               For though mine enemy thou hast euer beene,
               High sparkes of honour in thee haue I seene.
            
            Enter 
                  •
               xton with the coffin.
            
               Exton
               Great King, within this coffin I pr
                     •
                  sent
               Thy buried feare: herein all breathlesse lies
               The mightiest of thy greacest enemies,
               Richard of Burdeaux, by me hither brought.
            
            
               king
               Exton, I thanke thee not, for thou hast wrought
               
                  
A deed of slaunder with thy fatall hand,
               Vpon my head and all this famous Land.
            
            
               Exton.
               From your owne mouth my Lo. did I this deed.
            
            
               King.
               They loue not poison that do poison neede,
               Nor do I thee; though I did wish him dead,
               I hate the murtherer, loue him murthered:
               The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor,
               But neither my good word, nor Princely fauour;
               With Cayne go wander through shades of night,
               And neuer shew thy head by day nor light.
               Lordes, I protest my soule is full of wo,
               That bloud should sprincle me to make me grow:
               Come mourne with me, for what I do lament,
               And put on sulleyn blacke incontinent,
               Ile make a voiage to the holly lande,
               To wash this bloud off from my guiltie hand:
               March sadly after, grace my mournings heere,
               In weeping after this vntimely Beere.
            
            FINIS.
