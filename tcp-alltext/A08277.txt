IMITATION

His godly and constant
resolution in bearing all his
trialls, troubles and afflictions

Whose example of faith, patience,
hope, obedience and deliueries,
thankfulnesse and prayer,
is left euen for Princes, Potentates,
and all true Christians
to imitate.

            TO
THE HIGH
and most noble,
CHARLES, Prince
of Wales, Duke of Cornwall,
and of Yorke, and Earle
of Chester, bee here in this
life truest honour, highest happinesse,
and most perfect peace,
and after this life eternall
glory in the
Heauens.
            I Know not how to
excuse mee (most
gracious Prince) in
that I haue presumed

to attempt a matter of
so high and diuine a
subiect (considering
what I am) and to aduenture
it to your
Highnesse (knowing
who you are) but that
my heart was willing,
& ouercame a weake
vnderstanding, which
(first) it may please
your Highnesse of your
princely clemency to
accept, namely, the

will, and to pardon the
deed; for I may truly
protest that I intended
herein nothing lesse
than to be thought desirous
to seeme so impudent
as to giue your
Highnesse the least (or
to thinke that you needed
any other) aduice
or counsell in this behalfe,
than that which
you haue so plentifully
receiued from him

that gaue strength vnto
Dauid, and wisdome
vnto Salomon his son,
together with the
sweet fructifying seed
which hath beene so
diuinely sowne in your
Princely breasts by the
wisdome of our second
Salomon, your
most pious and most
truly religious Father.
            
            Humbly beseeching
your Highnes to conceiue

no other intention
in me, than an vnwillingnesse
to let slip
the Interim of my sequestred
imploiments
in your Highnesse seruice
(much against my
will) without some exercise
inwardly comfortable,
though outwardly
little profitable;
yet if any thing
vsefull (though but to
the vulgar) it may pray

your Princely fauour
being done, your
Highnesse seruice depending;
beseeching
the length of daies to
lengthen your daies to
his glory, your honor,
and comfort of such
as feare God.
            
               Your Highnesse most
humble seruant,

            A MOTIVE
to the Reader,
touching Meditation
and Prayer.
            
               First of Meditation.
               
                  
                     MEditation is an
inward action
of the
soule, wherin
the faithfull
exercise themselues, especially
vpon the Word
and promise of God, vpon
Heauen and heauenly

things, arising by the attentiue
hearing or serious
reading of the same Word,
deliberate consideration of
the truth and infallibility of
Gods promises contained
therein, and the assured
performance of them, touching
their future blessed
and glorious being after
this life, whereof the faithfull
heart being assured
through the testimony of
Gods holy Spirit, it delights
in nothing so much
as continually to thinke
and meditate of the same
according to the words of

Christ; Where our treasure
is, there are our hearts, and
thereof wee continually
thinke: DAVID had his
heart set vpon his treasure
hid with Christ aboue,
which made him to meditate
& cheerefully to sing,
O, how loue I the Law of the
Lord? It is my continuall
meditation; yea, I will meditate
in thy precepts, and
consider thy waies. So did
Salomon cry out, Blessed bee
the Lord God of Israel, who
spake with his mouth to Dauid
my father, and with
his hand hath performed it; 1
King. 8. 15, 16.
               
                  
All the promises of God
in Scripture doe administer
vnto the faithfull, matter of
continuall meditation and
serious consideration; and
among many of his promises,
his promse of defence
and deliuery of his in the
time of danger, trouble,
and affliction, is to be often
considered, for that it
concerneth especially the
children of God that are
most afflicted: who considering
the waies of God to
be mercy and truth, and that
what he promiseth he will
assuredly performe, cannot

but worke patience, and patience
hope; and how can
he bee without continuall
holy Meditation, whose
heart is with God, from
whom he hopeth his helpe
will come, but in Gods
owne time; and therefore
though wee hope, we may
not make haste; though he
promise to defend vs from
danger, & deliuer vs in trouble,
he will not so answer
our expectations, as if wee
knew the time when, or the
manner how to be releeued
or defended, better than he.
He will exercise his owne

children awhile to proue
their patience, faith and
obedience, to cause vs to
meditate and ponder his
word and promise, till hee
haue sufficiently tried our
constant assurance of his
timely deliuery, for it is his
property to come to helpe
his, when they thinke hee
hath most forgotten them.
               How suffered he Dauid,
a man chosen after his
owne heart, to bee enuironed
with infinite dangers,
in so much as he thought
God had forsaken him altogether,
and forgotten

him, and therefore cries
out, How long wilt thou forget
me Lord, for euer? and
againe hee confessed that
God had giuen him his
hearts desire, and that hee
had not denied the request
of his lips, whereby appeareth
that the sorce of liuely
faith, holy meditation, and
diuine prayer, are able to
make (God offended) God
appeased suddenly, to remoue
sorrow, and so bring
ioy.
               God hath promised to
be a defence to the faithfull
in whatsoeuer dangers, yet

if we wel weigh and consider
the course of Gods
dealing with his owne children,
and duly meditate of
his power, prouidence and
wisdome; wee shall finde
that hee doth not alwaies▪
come immediatly at the
call of his dearest children.
DAVID was banished
and persecuted
long, Ioseph was imprisoned
long, they both prayed
for deliuery, yet continued
in a hard estate, which
was an argument in humane
reason that God cared
not for them: and

aboue them both was innocent
Iob long and many
waies afflicted, God
saw his miseries and heard
his prayers, but he left him
yet to be an example to vs
of like expectation of Gods
timely releeuing vs, and in
his good time he made Dauid
a King, and Ioseph the
chiefe vnder Pharaoh in
Aegypt, and restored Iob to
his former, yea, to farre
greater glory.
               Thus doth God try his
dearest children, to occasion
them to know and
acknowledge, that howsoeuer

hee seeme to absent
himselfe from them in their
deepest dangers, and to
seeme deafe (as it were) vnto
their prayers, he yet hath
an eie both on them and
their enemies: hee was a
shelter vnto Dauid, and curbed
Saul; he saw Ioseph in
prison, but with his liberty
prepared his aduancement.
He saw Iobs afflictions,
but kept a hooke in
Satans nosthrills, that all
that he did against Iob serued
to his finall comfort.
               Though therefore it happen
the faithfull to be straited

and enuironed with so
many and mighty enemies
and troopes of troubles,
that there appeareth
no euasion, no deliuery, by
any visible meanes; yet
there remaineth holy Meditation,
patient deliberation,
and serious consideration
of Gods wonderfull
deliuerances of his, in all
like dangers: Consider Dauid
and all his troubles, and
you shall finde hee fainted
not, but depended onely
vpon the promises and
prouidence of God, with
a godly resolution, to wait

the issue of his hope, onely
meditating on Gods promises,
and considering his
waies, and how he had before
dealt with Abraham,
Izaak, Iaacob, Noah, Lot,
Moses, and other faithfull
fathers before him; the
meditation and consideration
of whose wonderfull
deliueries cannot but work
assurance in any beleeuing
heart in like manner,
though by vnlike and hidden
meanes, in good time
to be deliuered; and therefore
saith Dauid, by way of
meditation and confirmation

of his, and consequently
our faith in God, Our
Fathers trusted in thee, they
called vpon thee, and were
heard, they prayed vnto thee
and thou deliueredst them
out of all their troubles; as
if hee should say in himselfe
by way of Meditation,
I finde by the Word of
God, that he hath deliuered
many before my time,
that trusted in him & called
vpon him, in greater dangers
than I am in, why then
should I doubt or despaire
of like deliuery? I trust in
him as these fathers trusted:

I call vpon, and pray vnto
him as they did, therefore
surely hee will heare
me, and helpe me in time
conuenient; thus did Dauid
meditate in his troubles.
               God commanded Iaacob
to returne from Laban his
Vncle, into his countrie
and Kindred (from whom
and whence he fled) promising
to doe him good,
Gen. 32. 9. Could Iaacob
doe lesse than meditate and
t
                     •
                  inke seriously of this
command and promise of
God, considering hee was

to returne to his desperatly
malicious brother Esau,
who sought to murther
him? yet vpon due Meditation
and consideration of
Gods faithfull promise of
defending him and doing
him good, hee ouercame
feare by faithfull prayer,
and the Lord appeased his
brothers malice towards
him.
               Examples of like nature
are plentifull in holy Scriptures,
as of Mordecay and
the Iewes, Ester 7. of the
Bethulians, Iudith 7. and
many others.
               
                  
Holy meditation is most
necessary, and an especiall
Motiue to faithfull prayer,
and prayer can neuer be so
powerfull as vpon holy
premeditation, though
short, so it be serious, for
as rumination precedes digesture
in cleane beasts; so
holy Meditation goes before
effectuall prayer in
Christians.
               Seeing then that there is
no k
                     •
                  nde of trouble, danger,
misery or affliction
that can befall Gods children;
but there are examples
in the holy Booke of

God; wherein may bee
seene Gods outward deliuery
or inward comfort in
euery kinde, what need the
faithfull to faint in any?
               Search therfore the Scriptures,
meditate in them,
consider the ends and issues,
the patience and prayers,
of former godly men;
and let their faith, patience
and prayer, be paternes for
our imitation. Then if our
knowledge by reading and
hearing of the Word, our
continuall meditation in
the Word, doe worke in
vs through the same spirit

that guided them like assurance
and faith; we cannot
but adde preuailing prayer,
which being without
doubting or wauering, cannot
but in force (as it were)
at Gods hands (who is absolutely
powerfull) like deliueries
out of dangers and
timely releefe or release, in
troubles. And he that is a religious
obseruer of Gods
dealing for the defence of
his, and confounding his
& their enemies at this day,
cannot but see & approue
God to be the same God in
power, wil, prouidence, and

readinesse to helpe his, as
he was in any former age
to our fathfull fore-fathers;
Then search the Word,
meditate therein as Dauid
did day and night, pray
zealously and faithfully;
and this God, euen the
euerliuing and all-sufficient
God, shall effectually performe
in his good time,
whatsoeuer hee hath promised
and we pray for.
            
            
               
               Of Prayer.
               
                  THough faithfull
prayer be
powerfull to
preuaile with
God in and against
all dangers,
perills, & troubles, and an
armour of tried defence against
sin and Satan; yet few there be
that vse it, especially as they
ought; some not at all. Many
there are that either say in
their hearts there is no God,
as Psal. 53. 1. or that deny
the power of God, not acknowledging

him to be God,
and so cannot glorifie him as
God, Rom. 1. 21. Some also
are or haue beene so impious, as
they absolutely haue denied him,
as Pharaoh, Exod. 5. 2. Senacherib,
2 King. 18. 13. to 30.
Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 3. and
others, assuming as it were the
name of Gods vnto themselues.
They praid to none, but they as
Gods were praid vnto; whose
examples are to be detested as
abominable, blasphemous, and
deuilish; whose ends may onely
serue to terrifie such (though
neuer so mighty, preuailing in
their tyranny awhile) as either
forsake the liuing God, and trust
in or pray vnto them, or that
that are no gods: such are not

to be feared of them that truly
trust in and pray vnto the God
of hosts, as holy Dauid did,
whose example of faith, prayer,
and holy resolution in all dangers,
may encourage all faithfull
in all their troubles, to imitate
and practise the same.
               The onely and chiefe refuge
that this most godly King had,
and the principall weapons
wherewith he resisted and ouercame
his enemies, was feruent
prayer in a liuely faith.
               Faithfull prayer to God is
such a defence against whatsoeuer
danger as no enemy, be hee
neuer so mighty, malicious, or
carnally politike, can preuaile
against it; for howsoeuer a man
truly fearing God be beset with

(euen multitudes of) enemies,
so as no visible helpe can haue
accesse to rescue him or to deliuer
him; yet if hee send this
Messenger, faithfull prayer vnto
God, and wauer not in his assurance,
outward succour, or inward
comfort, will assuredly and
timely appeare. It was Dauids
refuge in euery danger, when
his perfidious Counseller Achitophel,
whose counsell was as
it were, the Oracle of God,
addressed his traiterous aduice
to rebellious Absolom, he only
praied to frustrate it, and
his depest wisdome turned into
folly, 2 Sam. 15. 31. Hezekiah
in danger of the King
of Ashur, vsed onely prayer to
God, and the Lord slew his

enemies one hundred fourescore
and fiue thousand in one night,
2 King. 19. Examples are infinite
of the force and effect of
prayer, in so much as there is
nothing that the faithfull want,
but Prayer, if it be faithfull and
feruent may obtaine, if God in
his wisdome thinke it fit for vs
to receiue.
               
                  Prayer is it whereby we speake
vnto God in a heauenly kinde
of familiarity, and whereby
God is, as it were, inforced to
cast away his rod, and to alter
his purpose of punishing.
               Great is the force and efficacy
of faithfull prayer, and greater
is the loue of God towards
vs, in admitting vs so freely
and boldly to come vnto him

with our petitions; nay, so louing
he is, that he allureth vs
saying, Call vpon mee in the
day of trouble, and I will
heare thee and deliuer thee,
and thou shalt glorifie me.
               
               Here is sufficient warrant
and encouragement for vs to
flie vnto God by prayer, in
whatsoeuer trouble, misery,
danger or affliction. And the
examples of deliuery and helpe
in euery kinde are so infinite, as
who so is conuersant in the old
and new Bookes of God, cannot
be ignorant of the force and effect
of faithfull Prayer, euen of
such as haue beene subiect to
like passions as we are: Ioshua
prayed, and the Sunne and
Moone stood still, Iosh. 10. 12.

                  Elisha prayed, and his enemies
were strucken with blindnesse,
2 Kings 6. 18. Eliah prayed,
and fire fell from Heauen and
destroyed them that came to
take him, 2 King. 1. 10.
               Faithfull Prayer doth as it
were ouercome God, in somuch as
when he hath a purpose to punish
a people, or a person, he wil forbid
the faithfull to pray for them,
lest he should be ouercome with
their prayer, and so be enforced
to spare them, Exod. 32. 10,
11. If the prayer of one faithfull
man may restraine God, as
it were, from executing his
iudgements vpon the wicked,
how much more may faithfull
prayer preuaile for the good
of a faithfull man?
               
                  
What should then hinder our
Prayer to God in our owne necessities
and dangers? Nothing
but impatience and vnbeliefe,
for if in a true and liuely
faith, and holy intention, wee
present our humble supplications
vnto God through Christ,
according to his will reuealed in
his Word, and wauer not,
Christ himselfe assureth vs to
obtaine what wee pray for;
Whatsoeuer yee aske (saith
he) the Father in my name,
hee will giue it you, Iohn
16. 23.
               Let vs not then be cast downe
in our spirits, but let vs lift vp
our hearts to him that seeth vs,
and taketh care for vs, and
hath both will and power to deliuer

vs. Hee hath a time in
his wisdome to humble vs, and a
time in his mercy to helpe vs;
a time to debase vs, and a time
to relieue vs in despight of Satan
and his most malicious instruments;
he had his time to
afflict Iob, and Ioseph, and
Dauid; and in his time againe
he deliuered them. Let vs therfore
in all our trialls, troubles
and afflictions call vpon God in
the Name of his Sonne, and we
shall finde that euen in our holy
Meditations he will thinke vpon
vs, but before we speake, he
will answer vs: and while wee
are yet praying, hee will heare
vs and helpe vs, and we shall
giue glory vnto his name.
               The faithfull onely haue the

promise to bee heard and releeued,
when they call faithfully,
and perseuere constantly, on the
true God. What true comfort
then or hope can they haue in
their prayers, that in stead of
calling on the liuing God in
Christ, cry vnto, and trust in,
false gods? They may cry and
knock their breasts, and cut
their flesh, and afflict their bodies
like Baals Priests, without
profit: though they may
prosper and preuaile a while to
the hardning of their hearts,
in the end they shall be confounded
and perish at the rebuke of
the God of hosts, as were Pharaoh,
that great King of Aegyt,
that contemned God, Exodus
14. 27, 28. Senacherib
                  
that blasphemed God, 2 Kings
9. 35. Antiochus that wicked
root, Mac. 1. 11. and all such
wicked Tyrants, that despising
the liuing God, trust in their
owne strength, and hunt after
the children of God to shed their
innocent bloud; let them alone,
their confusion sleepeth not.
               The strength of an army is
faithfull prayer to the God of
armies; an host of men, munition,
and militarie furniture,
are necessarie meanes; but
without deuout and feruent
prayer to God, best counsell is
vaine, aad strength feeble:
But where God is present in
both, affording a blessing to
both, there is certaine and true
victorie.
               
                  
We are not indeed to expect
miraculous deliueries, and to
neglect the meanes; but where
ordinary meanes faile (of necessity)
there may wee safely pray
and expect extraordinary. Our
owne experience doth approue
this to be true in two principall
late deliueries, wherein neither
the force nor wisdome of man
can bee said to haue the first
place; but God alone by his
owne wisdome found out the
preuention, and gaue such issue
to the inferiour execution, as is
maruellous in the eies of all men,
admired euen of our enemies, against
whom God himselfe shewed
himselfe an enemy: which
may teach and encourage vs
and all posterities to bee confident,

constant and conuersant in
feruent prayer to him that saued
vs, and discouered and discouraged
those that rose vp
both openly and secretly, to haue
as it were▪ swallowed vs vp
quite.
               And by these our deliueries,
we may well see and vnderstand
that if we call vpon him, he can
worke for our preseruation, as
well without meanes as by
meanes; yea where ordinary
meanes faile, he is able to raise
extraordinary, as hee did in
parting the waters for his owne
people to passe, and with the
same waters drowned their enemies;
for he is the same God he
was then, and he that saies that
God neither can nor will worke

extraordinarily at this day, denies
him to be God at this day;
but as faithfull prayers were
auaileable in our fore-fathers
daies, as when Moses prayed
feruently, the Israelites preuailed;
and when hee waxed cold,
the Amalekites had the better,
Exod. 17. 11. euen so are feruent
and faithfull prayers effectuall
at this day.
               We must yet beware, lest while
we pray with our tongues, that
our hearts and hope bee not set
vpon carnall meanes; for then
will God haue no respect vnto
our prayers, God will be either
the whole or no obiect of our assurance,
he will part his owne
glory with none.
               He may and doth afford his

most faithfull children visible
meanes; and if by them we preuaile,
we may not attribute our
good successe vnto the meanes,
but vnto the sword of the Lord,
not to Gideon: wee may not say
this man did, or without that
man wee had beene ouercome;
man may doe valiantly; but the
victory is onely of God who blesseth
the meanes; neither are we
to neglect outward meanes and
so presume vpon God; it is a
tempting of him, and argues no
true confidence in him, neither
may we contemne the meanes, be
they neuer so seeming weake, for
Gods power is seene in weaknes,
and his wisdome in our ignorance.
               Therefore whether our means

seeme likely or vnlikely of good
successe, let them neither lift
vs vp or cast vs downe, neither
make vs presume or despaire,
for God can saue as well by few
as by many, as appeareth by Gedeon,
who with three hundred
men ouercame a huge host of
the Medianites, Iudg. 7. 13
He can supply our occasions as
well by little as by much: Elijah
with little food trauelleth forty
daies and forty nights, 1 King.
19. 8. Many examples might
bee produced, but no man conuersant
in holy Scripture is ignorant;
and therefore our faith
should not bee the more assured
through the greatnesse, nor the
more dismaid at the weaknesse
of visible meanes, but to depend

onely on the prouidence of God
in prayer, wherein we are to vse
all reuerence, knowing that we
are in the presence of an infinite
Maiesty.
               
               Our prayers also must be sincere,
without hypocrisie, for hee
is a God that searcheth the
heart, he is iealous, he will not
be mocked, nor can he be deceiued
by outward conformity, for
he can finde out a counterfeit;
though Izaak could not discouer
Iaacob from Esau: Ahijah the
Prophet, by the Spirit of God
could discouer disguised Ieroboams
wife, 1 King. 14. 6.
Therefore must our prayers proceed
from a sincere, vpright, and
faithfull heart, beleeuing that
God is willing to beare and able

to performe what he promiseth:
otherwise we make him a God
without mercy, that can and
will not heare; a God without
truth that can and will not performe
his promise; or a God vnable
to doe it.
               Pray therefore in faith, reuerence,
humility, and true deuotion,
pray with the whole
heart without wauering or
doubting, without limiting the
holy one of Israel, either in the
time when, the thing what, or
the manner how hee should doe
the thing thou desirest; for hee
knoweth best what, when, and
how to doe all things for thee:
therefore as Moses said vnto
the Israelites, hold you your
peace, and see the saluation of

God. Then pray and be heard,
aske and receiue, seeke and thou
shalt finde fauour with God at
all times, in all places, and vpon
all occasions, euen thy God will
bee ready to helpe in greatest
time of need, which God for his
Christs sake grant, so be it.

            THE
IMITATION
OF DAVID his holy
resolution in all his
troubles.
            A Premeditation touching the
argument of the 27. Psalme.
            
               MANY worthy testimonies
the
holy Scriptures
doe afford vnto
vs of holy Dauids
godly and constant resolution,

in bearing his troubles
and afflictions; his admirable
deliuerances, and his
thankfulnesse to God for the
same; whose worthy example
may very fitly administer
vnto Gods faithfull children,
of what estate, calling or condition
soeuer, worthy matter
of imitation, of his most godly
resolution in like dangers,
troubles and afflictions, and
that without imputation of
presumption, though he were
a King, whose examples in
some cases is not fit for inferiours
to imitate. But in matters
concerning holy duties
to God, there ought to be no
difference betweene Princes
and people: for God is no accepter

of persons, but hee that
feareth him and worketh righteousnesse
(be he high or low,
rich or poore, King or vassall)
is accepted of him. And hee
that commeth neerest in the
imitation of the holy life of a
godly King, hee neerest resembleth
the King of Kings,
who is holy, and would haue
all men without exception to
become holy, as hee is holy;
and to beare all troubles, crosses
and afflictions with a godly
resolution, for his sake that
willingly suffered infinite miseries
and torments for ours:
and hee that endureth most
with most resolute and godly
patience, becommeth likest
vnto Christ our Redeemer.
            
               
This consideration comming
into my minde, and feeling
the heauy burthen of
this worlds miseries, crosses
and afflictions of diuers
kinds; I could not but for
mine owne satisfaction and
comfort search the Scriptures,
the Register of things of old,
written for our learning;
where finding, that all our
holy fathers, the dearest children
of God, in all ages from
the beginning, haue suffered
and patiently vndergone infinite
and grieuous troubles,
with most godly and constant
resolution, I tooke counsell
and courage, to imitate (as
farre as by the assistance of the
same grace of God, whereby

they suffered, I might) some
worthy preceding patterne
of faith and constancy: And
among many most worthy, I
finde none in generall troubles
and dangers, for constant
resolution, faithfull prayer
and patience, more fit for imitation
than godly Dauid;
whom although hee were a
King, and a man chosen after
Gods owne heart, yet was hee
not without his variety of afflictions,
especially enemies,
both before hee came to his
Kingdome, by Saul and his
vngodly instruments; and after
also, not onely by forraine
enemies, as the Philistines, the
Amonites, the Moabites, the
Amalakites, the Edomites,
               
and others; but by his owne
subiects, nay by them of his
own house, as by Ahitophel his
owne priuy Councellor, and
Absolon his owne son. He was
enforced to flie, and to hide
himselfe in the Wildernesse
in the time of Saul, who
sought his life; and was discouered
vnto Saul by faithlesse
Doeg. He suffered hunger,
and was denied to be refreshed
by sottish Nabal. His
wiues were taken prisoners,
and with great danger he recouered
them. He was like to
be stoned of his ow
                  •
               e people.
He was derided and mocked
by Mich
                     •
                  l his owne wife, for
praising God in a dance before
the Arke. His seruants

were shamefully intreated by
Haman, to whom hee sent
them, to congratulate him in
loue. Hee was forced to flie
bare footed from Absolon his
sonne. He was railed on, and
causlesse cursed by wicked
Shemey, with many other extremities
of all kinds; yet
fainted hee not, but through
faith hee tooke courage and
comfort, by his prayers vnto,
and dependance on GOD,
who neuer failed him, no
                  •
               
forsooke him, but alwaies and
in all his perills deliuered
him; and returneth the praise
and glory to God.
            The example of this most
worthy King, among many
other godly fore-fathers, doe

witnesse vnto vs, that it is no
new thing to see the dearest
children of God afflicted in
this life, yea most worthy
Kings, and that not without
the speciall prouidence and
loue of God, who will consecrate
his owne through many
troubles, which yet deserueth
not the glory which shall follow.
            
               Dauid in all his troubles
was neuer destitute of Gods
assistance & inward comfort;
for he depended vpon diuine
prouidence in faithfull praier,
the strongest armour against
enemies, the safest Castle against
dangers, and the best
assurance to obtaine whatsoeuer
we need. And therefore as

               Dauid beleeued in, and prayed
vnto this powerfull and
preuailing God, so may all
Gods afflicted childrē imitate
his faithfull and godly resolution
in all their dangers, with
like patience and hope, and
they shall be safe, as he plainly
and plentifully testifieth in
sundry most sweet and comfortable
Psalmes, especially in
this 27. Psalme, wherein being
in the middest of his
troubles, he sheweth the force
of his saith to bee such, as
though hee were in danger,
and forsaken of all his friends,
he was as fully assured to bee
deliuered in due time, as if he
had beene euen then out of
all danger.
            
               
This blessed example then
of a liuely faith, and the successe
thereof laid thus before
our eies, cannot but stirre vp
in vs, if we haue any faith, a
holy desire to imitate him according
to the measure of that
spirit which guided this godly
King, and made him as it
were the pen of a most diuine
Scribe, whose Scripture hath
left vs such heauenly learning,
as may teach vs all things,
both for this life and that
which is to come: and happy
is the man that truly followeth
his worthy example.
         
         
            
            MEDITATIONS
and Prayers vpon the
27. PSALME.
            
               
                  VERSE 1.
                  The Lord is my light and my
saluation, whom shall I feare?
The Lord is the strength of
my life, of whom shall I bee
afraid?
               
               
                  AS God hath giuen
vs outward and
corporall eyes to
see and behold the
workes of his hands here below,

so hath he giuen vs inward
and spirituall light to
sée himselfe, and spiritually
to behold the wonderfull
things hee hath done for our
soules saluation; therefore
when we looke vpon his creatures
with our corporall
eies, wee should lift vp the
eyes of our mindes to behold
him that hath made, framed,
and preserued these visible
things.
               The Sunne is a visible
creature, by whose beames
our bodily eies are enlightned,
for the eye it selfe giueth
not, but receiueth the light
which the Sunne giueth, for
if of it selfe it gaue the light,
wee should apprehend 
                     •
                  no

darknesse at all; but take away
outward light, and the
eye is darke: So the eye of
the minde, the eye of the
soule cannot of it selfe apprehend
that spirituall light,
which is Christ, that lighteth
euery man that commeth into
the world: And without
him the minde is darke, and
runneth and rusheth vpon
diuers stumbling blocks of
errors and dangers. But he
that is guided by that light
which was Dauids light,
séeth and walketh the way of
safety and saluation: in that
light (Christ) is the well of
life, he is the light in whom
all the Elect sóe the true light
and walke in it.
               
                  
The ordinary meanes to
apprehend Christ the light,
is the word, which he taught
and left vnto vs, yet not of
it selfe that light, but onely
sheweth it, for euery man
that heareth the word, séeth
not the light comprehended
in the same; but they onely
whose inward eies the Lord
openeth to behold Christ the
light, and they walke in the
light. Many saw Christ, but
not as hee was the light and
their saluation; for they delighted
in darknes more than
light, working wickednesse
euen against that light in
whom, and by whom, and
through whom, they onely
that truly séeke that light

haue assured saluation, neither
is there safety or saluation
in any other. Therefore
doth David ioyne light and
saluation together, because
that without that light there
is no saluation, for light goeth
with or before saluation;
for without the light of
knowledge there can bee no
faith, and without faith no
saluation. Dauid through
faith was bold to affirme
that the Lord was his light,
and consequently his saluation,
and hee that would defend
him from all his enemies,
and therefore resolueth
not to feare what man
could doe vnto him.
               Our owne naturall light,

the light of our eyes is an especiall
blessing of God: yet
for vnruiinesse it may bee
compared to the tongue; for
as the tongue is an vnruly
euill, in setting as it were
the whole world on fire, so
are the eyes extrauagant,
and set the heart on fire; and
therefore saith Dauid, Turne
away mine eies from regarding
vanity: for he found by
wofull experience, that the
light of the eye doth administer
vnto the minde diuers
dangerous obiects, as to himselfe
the nakednesse of Bershaba,
with the sight of whom
he was so enflamed with the
fire of lust, which first entred
by the eie, that he committed

grieuous sinnes in the accomplishment
thereof. Yet
was Dauid himselfe reputed
as it were the light of Israel,
which hee assumed not
vnto himselfe, but attributed
the true light that he had
vnto the light of lights; saying,
Surely thou art my light
O Lord, and the Lord will
lighten my darknesse: And againe,
the Lord is my light
and my saluation.
               
               By his owne naturall
light hee could not sée his
owne error of adultery and
marther, vntill hee was inwardly
enlightned, then hee
could confesse it: neither
could he see and consider how
the Lord had defended him,

but by that dim light which
gaue him courage & strength
against the 
                     •
                  eare and the
Lion, the ouercomming of
whom gaue him assurance
of the victory against Goliah:
his experience of Gods
fauour towards him grew
daily more and more, encouraging
others also to depend
on the power, prouidence
and loue of God by his example,
saying, and assuring
them that the Lord would be
a sure refuge vnto them in
their afflictions, for hee faileth
none that faithfully séeke
him; and how can we séeke
him but by Prayer? I will
call vpon the Lord, saith Dauid,
who is worthy to be praised,

so shall I bee safe from
mine enemies: though they
haue many meanes to hurt,
yet God that is our light and
our saluation, hath many
more meanes to helpe and to
defend vs: therefore saith
Dauid, whom should I feare,
the Lord is my rocke and my
fortresse, and hee that deliuereth
mee, my God and my
strength, in him will I trust,
my shield, the horne also of
my saluation and my refuge,
of whom shall I be afraid?
If I haue Iehouah on my
side, what can man doe vnto
me? If he be my light, I shall
liue in light and walke in
light, for in him is no darknesse
at all; he offereth light

by his liuely Word, and enlightneth
our inward parts
by the bright beames of his
heauenly Spirit. Being then
inwardly armed, howsoeuer
outwardly endangered, wée
néed not feare, but as Dauid
did, let vs cast our burthen
vpon the Lord and hee shall
defend vs; and let vs commend
our care vnto him, for
he careth for vs: of whom or
of what then need we to bee
afraid?
               Saluation commeth not
of flesh nor by fleshly meanes,
as the true light is not of the
world nor of worldly men.
Therefore séeke not thy light
nor safety through the policy
or strength of the flesh, neither

dreame of saluation by
worldly meanes, but breake
through the walls of flesh,
and mount vp in true contemplation
of that sauing
light that shineth from aboue;
from thence commeth
the strength against which
no carnall force shall preuaile:
and beware of such as
promise vnto themselues
safety and saluation without
this true light, as the wise by
their policies, the rich by
their wealth, the mighty by
their much strength and multitudes,
and as some by their
owne workes: All which are
broken réeds & vaine props,
and weake meanes to saue
the outward man, much lesse

the inward soule. How then
can they say, whom shall I
feare? of whom shall I bee
afraid? when indéed they
cannot but bee afraid euen
where no feare is.
               Could Achitophels counsell,
Nebuchadnezzars greatnesse,
Pharaohs stoutnesse,
Goliahs strength, Senacheribs
mighty army, Hasaels
swiftnesse, or the Pharisies
workes saue them? yet doth
foolish flesh and bloud account
this weake and feeble
meanes their glory, their
life, and their saluation: But
as Achitophel, whose counsell
was like the Oracle of
God, did hang himselfe; as
Nebuchadnezzar in his greatest

pompe became as a beast
of the field; as Pharaoh in his
hot pursuit was drowned
and his army; as Senacherib
was slaine by his owne sons;
as Goliah for all his great
strength was slaine with a
small stone; as Hazael for all
his Roe-like swiftnesse, was
slaine in his running; and as
the Pharisies, for all their
workes, were condemned by
Christ the light: So neither
the wisest of the world, the
greatest and most glorious
in the world, the strongest in
strength, nor he that iustifieth
himselfe most by his best
workes, worke not onely no
saluation vnto themselues
as of themselues, but their

owne destruction. But the
Lord of Hosts is my light,
my strength and my saluation,
therefore will I not bée
afraid.
               Consider well the benefit
of thy light in the Lord, embrace
the Lord thy light and
thy saluation, embrace him
in his Word, for God is the
Word, the Word that light,
that light thy life and thy saluation.
               Here then is the light that
guideth the blinde, and happy
is the soule that hath this
glorious light, he needs not
feare she secret practises of
the wicked, which this light
discouereth, nor the force
of the mighty, which this

strength withstandeth, for
God is his saluation.
               Feare not man then, who
killeth but the body, feare
not the fire that consumeth
but the body, feare not the
Sea that drowneth but the
body, feare not sicknesse that
toucheth but the body, feare
not the sword that pierceth
but the body; feare nothing
that can preuaile but against
the body, for the Lord is thy
light and thy saluation.
               O feare this Lord and reuerence
this light; he séeth in
darknesse, feare him that can
kill both body and soule, and
can cast both into vtter darknesse;
feare this great God,
feare none but him that can

saue and kill, that can cast
downe and exalt, that can
with his Word worke what
he will, when he will, and as
he will; feare him in loue,
and loue him in feare, call
vpon him, despaire not in
him, he is thy saluation.
               Feare not the world nor
worldly things, feare onely
firme in the world, and flie
from euill, which this true
light hateth; then feare not
man, for if a thousand assaile
thee, feare not, but pray and
beléeue, and trust in the Lord
thy saluation: he will open
the eyes of thy faith and thou
shalt sée with Elisha millions
of meanes to defend thée; if
pouerty or want oppresse

thée as it did sometimes Dauid,
feare not, he will reléeue
thée, for hée preserueth with
little as with much, hée fed
many thousands with little
meanes, and when they were
all well filled, there was taken
vp in the remainder
more then was before they
had eaten. He increased the
Oile and Meale of the poore
Widow, that she fed her selfe
and hers, and paid her debts
with the remainder. Hee
brought water out of the
stones, and out of the dry
Jaw-bone of an Asse. Hée
fed his children with Bread
from Heauen, and sent them
Quailes in the hungry Wildernesse.
He sent abundance

of wheat extraordinarily vnto
distressed Samaria This is
he, euen that great God, that
is the sustainer of my life, my
light and my saluation: and
not mine alone, but the God
of all that faithfully séek him
in their distresse.
               Should I then feare,
though I be enuironed with
enemies? though I were in
distresse? nay, should I feare
though I were in penury and
want? though I were imprisoned
for the constant profession
of Christs truth? did he
not breake the fetters, and
opened he not the very iron
gates, and cast the watchmen
in a slumber to fetch Peter
out of prison? did he not

giue Ioseph and Paul fauour
with their Jailors? of whom
or of what then may the
faithfull bee afraid? what
crosses, what troubles, what
afflictions, what threats of
tyrants can make Gods children
afraid? though the seas
rage and rose, though the
world be in confused combustion,
though the mountains
cleaue in sunder, though the
heauens melt, though he that
made all consume all, I will
not feare. The Lord high
& mighty, he is the strength
of my life; nay, he is to mee
life it selfe, who then or what
can without him force my
death? If he take away this
life, he hath prouided for me

a better and permanent:
whom or what shall I be afraid
of then? Shall I be afraid
of Hell or Satan? Hée
my Lord in Christ, my light
and my saluation, hath conquered
both Satan and Hell,
what néed I feare?
               
                  A Prayer that God will be our
light and our saluation in all
our troubles and dangers.
                  O Lord, who art the
light that neuer goeth
out, whereby
thou guidest and
gouernest those that acknowledge
their owne darknesse;

thou art the strength that neuer
groweth weake, whereby
thou sauest & defendest thine
from the hands of all that hate
them. Bee thou my light, O
Lord, and lighten my darknesse,
that I may walke in that
light and neuer goe astray, for
there is no agreement betweene
error and thy truth;
giue mee therefore heauenly
knowledge, and I shall not be
ignorant of that which I
ought to know; and assist me
with thy diuine grace, and I
shall practise that which thou
hast taught me to know: Be
thou my strength, then whom
need I to feare? stand thou on
my side, and then of whom
should I be afraid?
                  
                     
Stretch forth thy hand and
hold me vp, thou hast a mighty
arme, and strong is thy
right hand: in thee therefore
I trust, and will not feare what
man can doe vnto me.
                  Be not farre from mee, O
my God, for thou seest my
troubles and knowest my
dangers; neglect me not, but
hasten to helpe me, giue care
vnto me and saue me, and let
not mine enemies haue their
desires against mee, nor triumph
ouer me: though they
be many, and in shew far too
mighty for me, yet in comparison
of thy strength they are
weake and of no strength;
they trust in their Chariots,
munition and multitudes;

but I trust in thee and in thy
strength alone, only praying
thee to blesse vnto me the ordinary
and lawfull meanes
which it shall please thee to
raise vp in thy wisdome for
my defence. Though I doe
know and doe acknowledge,
that as a horse of it selfe is a
vaine helpe to deliuer his rider
by his great strength or
swiftnesse, so are all outward,
visible and carnall meanes vnable
to defend mee without
thee; and vnlesse thou blesse
the vse of them, and dispose
and manage them in thy wisdome
for my defence, they
are also vaine.
                  Therefore come I vnto thee
my God, my strength, my

light and my saluation, who
hast promised, and art able to
send euen from Heauen to
saue me.
                  Thou canst command an
host of Angels to campe about
mee; though enuironed
with many and mighty aduersaries,
yet hauing thee on
my side, I know there shall be
more with mee than with
them; while I am vnder thy
protecting wings I am safe, I
will not feare.
                  Giue thine Angels charge
of me therefore, O Lord, to
keepe & defend me: shew thy
power in my weaknesse, and
the weaknes of mine enemies
by thy strength: then though
an host pitch against me, my

heart shall not bee afraid;
though war be raised against
me, I will trust in thee, my
Lord, my light, my strength,
and my saluation.
               
            
            
               
                  VERSE 2. and 3.
                  2. When the wicked, euen
mine enemies and my foes,
came vpon mee to eat vp
my flesh, they stumbled and
fell. 3. If an host pitched
against me, my heart should
not be afraid; though warre
be raised against me, I will
trust in thee.
               
               IN all actions Experience
is as the mother of knowledge,
and knowledge the

ground of Assurance, which
made Dauid strong in his resolution
to encounter Goliah,
hauing formerly found
that God assisted him in two
seuerall dangers, the one in
killing a Beare, the other in
ouercomming a Lion; two
strong, fierce, and deuouring
beasts, and that when he was
but young and a Shepherd;
yet it seemeth he had learned
to feare God and to trust in
him, for that he acknowledged
that he ouercame them,
not by his owne proper
power, but by the power of
God, which two conquests
wrought in him-assurance,
that by the same aid hee
should vanquish that monster

of men Goliah: though
his vgly presence and furniture
of armes amazed the
whole host of Israel, Dauid
yet not daunted, hauing a
strong faith in God, vndertooke
the combat and preuailed,
though that monster
scorned him, and threatning
that hee would giue his flesh
to be deuoured of the Fowles
of the aire, and wilde beasts of
the field, which by the aid of
him in whom Dauid trusted,
came contrarily to passe, for
Dauid tooke off his head and
disarmed him, and left his
carkasse to the Fowles of the
aire, whereby he more and
more increased in faith,
strength and courage, and

bold to assure himselfe, that
as this monster stumbled
and fell at his flying stone
that would haue eaten vp his
flesh; so should all his wicked
enemies and foes when
they should come vpon him
to eat vp his flesh, namely, to
take away his life, they
should euen so stumble and
fall, as by experience he after
found that God still defended
him, so that to the praise of
God hee sung, When the
wicked, euen mine enemies
and my foes, came vpon me to
eat vp my flesh, they stumbled
and fell.
               
               When Saul a mighty King
sought Dauids life to destroy
it, first by his owne hand

with a speare, purposing to
haue nailed him to the wall
suddenly (which by Gods
prouidence he auoided) and
after commanded Ionathan
his sonne, and other his seruants
to murther him: but
God stirred vp the heart of
Ionathan to affect Dauid so
entirely, that he reuealed vnto
him his fathers malicious
intention against the life of
Dauid, shewing thereby the
wonderfull prouidence of
God in preseruing his from
most imminent dangers.
               
                  Dauid not yet secure, for
feare fled from Saul, as not
willing to tempt God by presuming
vpon Gods deliuery,
and not to vse lawfull

meanes to prouide for himselfe;
hid himselfe in the
Mountaines where Saul his
enemy with a great power
pursued him, suborning intelligencers
to discouer Dauids
abode wheresoeuer hee hid
himselfe: where may be noted
the heat of the malice of
an enemy, and how ready
some wicked wretches are to
shew themselues officious to
betray the innocent, to please
a Tyrant.
               But note further the prouidence
of God, in finding
secret & vnexpected meanes
to preserue the innocent, for
when Saul was in his most
furious pursuit to kill Dauid,
his abode being discouered,

God found a meanes to
put a Ring in Sauls nose (in
fauour of Dauid, and for his
owne glory) inforcing him
to retire from further following
that innocent man;
and to hasten th
                     •
                   rescue and
reléefe of his owne Territories
which the Philistines had
euen then by Gods prouidence
inuaded: and being
sore beset with his enemies,
he desperatly fell on his own
sword and died. So it came
to passe, that when the wicked,
euen Dauids enemies and
his foes, came vpon him to
eat vp his flesh, namely to
take away his lise, they stumbled
and fell.
               
               God was euer with Dauid;
                  
for Dauid alwaies depended
on God, which who
so doth, shall neuer stumble
nor fall. But euen his faith
and integritie shall make his
very enem
                     ••
                  s to feare him:
As Saul feared Dauid, because
God was with him,
whose chiefe armour and
weapons were his feare and
trust, in the name and assistance
of Iehouah, wherewith
he fought diuers battels,
and slew with great
slaughter many Philistines
his enemies; not onely before,
but after he was anointed
King, none preuailed against
him, but they that
came vpon him stumbled and
fell.
               
                  
Séeing then that Faith,
and the feare of God and
praier be approued of force,
so far to preuaile with God,
as to obtaine his helpe and
defence against wicked enemies
& foes, that when they
assaile vs, he causeth them to
stumble and fall; let vs
imitate the faith, and fight
with that assurance that Dauid
did: for he is the same
God still, of the same power,
of the same prouidence and
loue. And we are not without
like enemies as Dauid in his
time had, though without
cause.
               To relate all Dauids dangers,
troubles, and deliueries,
battels and victories,

though profitable for our
encouragement: yet might
séeme tedious, not altogether
impertinent, because by
them is the loue, the power,
and prouidence of God séene
in defending and reléeuing
the faithfull; and his iust
iudgements against wicked
enemies of their stumbling
and fals. Yet let his fa
                     •
                  th
and constancy moue all faithfull
men to imitate his vertues;
not in that he was a
King, but in that hée was a
godly King, of whom God
giues testimonie, that hee
was a man according to Gods
owne heart; not that he was
so conformable by nature,
but so framed by the grace

and good will of God: For,
by nature he was no better
in Gods acceptation than
Saul, who was also a King:
But God so seasoned Dauids
heart (of his owne frée mercy)
that he obeyed and conformed
his actions, according
as God had wrought in his
heart, and left Saul to the corruption
of his owne heart:
yet did not Dauid glory in any
merit of his owne, but
gaue the praise to God, saying,
Blessed is he whom thou
choosest and causest to come
vnto thee. And againe, The
wicked are strangers from the
wombe, euen from the belly
haue they erred: Yet Saul after
he was anointed King by

                  Samuel, was turned into another
man, and was numbred
among the Prophets;
but no otherwise than Iudas
among the Apostles.
               God is the God of all that
faithfully and constantly fly
vnto him for succour; For,
saluation belongeth vnto him
alone; not vnto the power of
Kings, bée they neuer so
strong in multitudes of armed
men, with shipping, or
whatsoeuer military and
warlike furniture; but
where Gods continuall blessing
doth accompany a few,
they preuaile against many;
though sometimes God may
suffer his owne dearest children
to bée encountred and

beaten by his owne and their
enemies: Especially when
they presume to stand too
much vpon their owne
strength, as vpon allies,
friends, and multitudes: preuailing
with these, God is
not so glorified, as when he
by few ouercommeth a multitude:
As when Dauid by a
few slew two and twentie
thousand Aramites: And
Ioshua fiue combined Kings,
wherein yet he would not
haue the whole victory to bée
ascribed to Ioshuahs forces,
but was himselfe the principall
in the ouerthrow, not
onely in aiding and directing
Ioshuah, but in powring
downe haile-stones from heauen

vpon his enemies, wherby
he slew more men than
Ioshuahs Army did by the
sword. And sometimes hée
taketh to himselfe the whole
praise of the victory; as when
Senacherib came against good
Hezekiah, with a most inuincible
supposed Army,
vnder the conduct of Tartan
Rabsaris, and Rabsakeh, railing
vpon, and threatning
Hezekiah, and blaspheming
God, stiling himselfe the
Great King of Ashur, whom
he thought God himselfe
was not able to withstand,
flattering himselfe as proud
Tyrants use to doe (as wée
haue seene) that hée in despight
of Hezekiahs God,

would depriue him of his
Kingdome▪ pretending that
he came in the name of the
Lord (as some of late haue
done) Are wee come (saith
he) or doe wee this without
the Lord? Whereat Hezekiah,
in déed, according to humane
frailtie was afraid: But asking
counsell of the Lord by
faithfull praier (the best refuge
and defence in danger)
he became assured of Gods
assistance and banisht feare.
And that night, that God
(which that Tyrant blasphemed,
as not of power to resist
him) sent his destroying
Angell and slew Senacheribs
army, one hundred foure▪
score and fiue thousand men.

We may not forget our like
deliueries fresh in our memories,
euen by the méere
hand of God.
               It is not superfluous to
recount other famous Histories,
recorded in the Booke
of God, which for further
confirmation of our Faith in
God, in like danger are plentifull.
Benadab, that mightie
King of Aram, threatned
Ahab King of Israel to depriue
him, not onely of his
Kingdome, but of all that
hée had, of his Siluer and
Gold, of his Women and
faire children: She wing hereby
the insolency, pride, and
securitie of Tyrants, who
by reason of their carnall

strength, force and multitudes,
will dispose of the
lands, and share the possessions
of them, whose Territories
they thirst after, and
that before their arriuall, as
though the victory were
theirs before the incounter.
As we with our eares haue
heard that our enemies haue
boasted, through the false
and forged benediction of
him that is a deceiuer, and
yet taketh the falsly conceiued
authority from heauen.
But our God laughed their
pride, insolency, and security
to scorne; taking our cause
into his owne hand, confounded
their deuices, daunted
their hearts, weakned their

armes, abandoned their Nauies
by his owne power;
euen as he gaue proud Benadab
into Ahabs power,
though a wicked King and an
Idolater, therefore not for
Ahabs sake, but for his owne
Names seke, and his owne
peoples safety. And to shew
his Omnipotent power in
defending his owne, and
confounding his and their
enemies. So that the truly
faithful in God being threatned,
beset and besieged by
wicked multitudes, néed not
to be afraid: for though war
be raised against them; that
God that defended Dauid,
Hezekias, and all that haue
truly called vpon him in like

danger, will as hée hath
euer hitherunto, defend vs.
               They that haue the God
of Hosts on their side, néed
not to feare though Kings
combine, and people rage, as
if they would eat vp their
flesh. Onely let them liue
godly, pray faithfully; and
vse ordinary meanes lawfully:
then if an Host pitch against
them, their hearts néed
not be afraid though warre
be raised against them, let
them trust in him, and they
shall sée the saluation of God.
               They that fight against
Gods people, fight euen against
God himselfe: as Paul
persecuting his children, persecuted
Christ. If therefore

a mighty Host inuade vs,
we may boldly, though in
seeming weaknesse, encounter
them; for there are more
with the children of God,
though not séene, than with
the wicked. God neuer faileth
nor forsaketh his, vnlesse
they forsake him: he leaueth
them not, vnlesse they leaue
him.
               Infinite are the examples
hereof in holy Scriptures,
which might be also produced,
further to confirme our
assurance: And were it néedfull,
there might be inserted
not a few examples of Gods
like deliueries, recorded in
our owne Chronicles, and in
our own remembrances. But

where Gods Spirit speaketh
by the pens of Gods owne
Secretaries, there néed no
humane testimonies, but
onely to shew that God is
still the same. He is Alpha
and Omega, the same, yesterday,
to day, and for euer;
therefore may the man that
is godly, assure himselfe with
holy Dauid: If an Host of
enemies pitch against him, his
heart need not bee afraid,
though war be raised against
him he may trust in this; That
when the wicked, euen his
enemies and his foes come
vpon him to eat vp his flesh,
they shall stumble and fall.
               
               
                  
                  A Praier to God; that he will
defend vs from our Enemies.
                  O Holy and most mightie
God of Hosts, who
dwellest in the heauens, and
yet art thou absolute also in
the earth, gouerning; guiding,
directing, and protecting,
those that feare thy
name, so that they need not
feare the power or malice of
whatsoeuer aduersaries; for
saluation belongeth vnto thee
alone, and thy blessing is
euermore vpon them that
faithfully depend vpon thee:
Therefore (Lord) though we
be weake in power, ignorant

in carnall policies, destitute
of humane aid, and beset
with enemies, who raise deadly
warre against vs, confirme
our faith in thee, and we shall
be strong; yea, stronger than
our enemies, and wiser than
our most politicke and subtill
aduersaries; and shall be either
able to withstand their violence,
or escape their mischiefes:
though we haue no
other defence but thy prouidence,
no other armour but
thy loue; no other weapons
but true faith, and a holy feare
of thy name; yet in this defence
will we trust, and in this
saluation will we reioyce.
                  In this confidence, Lord,
come we vnto thee, powring

out our hearts before thee; not
because thou knowest them
not, but because thou knowest
them; therefore come we vnto
thee, that thou maist bee
pleased to remoue our feare,
and ease our griefe; and to be
strengthned and confirmed
in a liuely, assurance of our
safetie and saluation in thee,
and of thy defence against
these our enemies, for there is
none besides thee that can
deliuer vs.
                  Remember Lord thy goodnesse,
which thou vouchsafedst
to our faithfull fore-fathers
of old, how thou deliueredst
them from their enemies
when they cried vnto
thee. Heare vs we pray thee,

O Lord, and helpe vs, for
vaine is the helpe of man.
                  Turne our feare into assurance
of thy fauour and helpe;
our mourning into reioycing
in thee. Loose our sorrowes,
and gird vs againe with gladnesse:
let not our sinnes hinder
thy mercies, wherein wee
pray thee to turne the counsell
of our wicked aduersaries into
foolishnesse, their strength
into weaknesse, and their hope
into despaire.
                  Thou art the Lord of hosts,
high and mightie, louing vnto
those that feare thee, helpfull
vnto those that trust in
thee, and a terrible God vnto
them that despise thee or
thine; What Tyrant can stand

before thee? What King can
encounter thee, or take thy
children out of thy hands?
Pharaoh could not detaine Israell,
when thou wouldest
transplant them: Saul could
not hurt Dauid, thou defending
him. Senacherib could
not haue his desire against
Hez
                           •
                        kias, thou fighting for
him; our enemies could not
hurt vs, thou curbing them. O
shew thy selfe now as thou
hast euer done, our defender.
                  With speed, O'Lord, reforme
all our imperfections,
couer the multitude of our
grosse and fearefull sins, which
call for enemies, and other
punishments in thy iustice to

be inflicted vpon vs: Turne
thou vnto vs, and we shall returne
vnto thee: Let our repentance
appeare by the mortification
of our sinfull desires:
Humble vs, and we shall
be humbled, then shalt thou
in compassion pardon vs, and
in thy fauour compasse vs about,
as with▪ a shield: Thou
shalt bee our refuge in our
greatest danger; for there is
no God besides thee, no help
but of thee: Thou alone art
able to command an Hoste of
Angels from heauen, to attend
and guard vs: Twentie
thousand thousand Angels
canst thou send from heauen
to defend vs, thy selfe the
chiefe Leader of that celestiall

army: whereof one of them
is sufficient to confound a
million of thine and our wicked
enemies when they assaile
vs to cat vp our flesh; thou in
a moment canst make them
to stumble and fall.
                  What then is man? Or what
is the force of Princes, when
thou takest part against them
in the behalfe of them whom
thou wilt defend? Therefore
cast we our burden and care
vpon thee, for thou hast promised
to care for vs.
                  O send therefore from heauen
and saue vs; haue mercy
vpon vs, O God, haue mercy
vpon vs, for we trust in thee:
And vnder the shadow of thy
wings will wee shelter our

selues, vntill our enemies bee
either conuerted or confounded.
Then shall we praise thy
name, O Lord, for that thou
hast not left vs as a prey vnto
the will of our enemies: and
though we walke in the midst
of troubles, yet we know and
are assured that thou wilt take
a conuenient time to finish
the worke of our absolute deliuery:
For thy mercy, and
thy truth, and thy power, endure
from generation to generation.
Preserue vs therefore,
O God, from these cruell men,
and the praise and glory shall
bee thine, the comfort ours.
And the example of thy so
fatherly protecting vs, shall
be a motiue to others in like

danger to call vpon thee. So
be it.
               
            
            
               
                  VERSE 4.
                  One thing haue I desired of
the Lord that I will require,
euen that I may
dwell in the house of the
Lord all the daies of my
life, to behold the beauty
of the Lord, and to visit
his temple.
               
               
                  GReat is the difference
betwéene
the worldling &
the true Christian;
betwéene a
carnall and a spirituall minded

man: The one coueteth
to dwell and to haue his continuall
abode here below, the
other soareth and aspireth
vpward: the one resembleth
the Swine, the other the Eagle:
the one is neuer satisfied
with earthly and carnall
things, for hee hath as many
desires as he hath senses, and
euery pleasing thing that offereth
it selfe to any of them
he coueteth, for euery sense
hath its particular delights:
as many senses so many fantasies
numberlesse, yet neither
of them can be satisfied,
for the heart of a carual man
ingrosseth them all, and the
more vanities it apprehendeth,
the more desire increaseth;

for, the eye is neuer satisfied
with seeing, nor the
care with hearing pleasing
things. But the spirituall
minded desireth onely one
thing, namely, to be assured
of his saluation and the glory
to come. And therefore holy
Dauid desired (as all true
Christians ought) this one
thing, for this only one thing
is necessary.
               
                  Bershaba the wife of Dauid,
and mother of Salomon,
desired but one thing of her
sonne, and hee promised her
faire, but performed it not
according to her desire. But
Dauid the father of Salomon,
desired one thing which hée
longed for, of a King greater

than Salomon, and a matter
of far greater moment than
was Bershabaes, and his Petition
was accepted: both
their Petitions séemed to
procéed of loue, but the difference
of their issues was
great; the one procured hatred
and death, the other a
most blessed successe. Shée
made her request to man, in
whom to put confidence is
vaine. He made his request
to God, the holy one of Israel,
in whom there is mercy and
truth. To whom also Salomon
made one especiall request,
only for wisdome, and
obtained it, and with it many
earthly blessings which
he asked not. So bountifull

is God, as if wée aske that
one thing necessary, namely
the Kingdome of God and
the righteousnesse thereof,
he will also adde blessing vpon
blessing, though we aske
them not.
               
                  Dauids only Petition was,
yt 
                  he might dwell in the house
of the Lord all the daies of his
life: A blessed (yet a strange)
request of a King in the opinion
of worldly men, who
might thinke Dauid not to be
so wise as some ambitious
and carnall polititians are
at this day, who had rather
be in Kings Courts to take
their pleasures, than to bee
restrained in a Temple for a
day. And Dauid being a

King, might haue retired
himselfe in his Palace, and
haue taken what pleasure
and delight hee would; hauing
a Kingdome to supply
whatsoeuer might haue pleased
any of his senses. But
these delights hée found not
answerable to his affection,
which was seasoned from
aboue, hauing tasted so
swéetly of the loue of Iehouah,
who of a Shepherd made
him a King, and who had so
often deliuered him from his
enemies; he had rather bée
conuersant with him in his
house one day, than a thousand
in the Court of Saul,
or in his owne Court among
his Gallants. Nay, he would

choose rather to be a doorekéeper
in the house of God, than
to command an earthly kingdome,
and to be depriued of
his heauenly exercises in the
house of God.
               It is a most glorious estate
indéed to be a King, but farre
more glorious to be a godly
King. He is Gods Uice-gerent
in that part of the earth
wherein God in his prouidence
hath set him; yet must
he looke to haue some discontents
mixt with his greatnesse,
and necessary too; otherwise
greatnesse might
cause forgetfulnes, that he is
a man, as former examples
haue discouered. And therefore
did God visit Dauid
                  
(chosen after his own heart)
with many troubles, to the
end he should not be vnmindfull
what he was, & whence,
and from what estate God
had raised him to that place
of eminence: and that hée
should serue the Lord, and
maintaine his lawes, and
defend his people, cherishing
the good, and chastising the
euill. And therefore was
Dauid to forward in calling
his people to serue the Lord,
and himselfe to be the leader
of them to the Temple of
God, to which he had so sincere
a desire, that hée requested
of the Lord that hee
might dwell therein all the
daies of his life, or at least

haue frée liberty often to visit
it, to the praise of God
and exercise of prayer.
               This desire is commonly
the last and least in great
men, for the most part though
no doubt they desire (as Balaam
did) to die (when necessity
requireth) the death of
the righteous, and greater
glory would it be vnto them
if they would practice (while
they haue time) the life of the
righteous as they seldome
doe; yet few or none, of
whatsoeuer quality are so
irreligious in shew, but they
will looke into the house of
God, peraduenture once, it
may be twice in a Sabbath.
And peraduenture thinke it

long, as loth to spare their
pleasures, delights or profits
to liue a whole day in the
Temple of God with fasting
and prayer. Some would
thinke it as hard a taske as
the bondage of Aegypt, or
the captiuity of Babylon.
But blessed bée God, some
there are that haue Dauids
desire, though not to dwell
really in the Temple, yet to
bee comfortably conuersant
among Gods people, in hearing
God speake vnto them,
and they to speake vnto
God.
               This is that that great
men should principally desire
for their example in well
doing much moueth inferiours

to imitation, for it is
commonly obserued, that example
doth draw more to
good or euill, than documents
or dehortations. The godly
life of a great man is as a
Towre séene a far, and many
especially his followers
will imitate his steps, at
least in shew, and euen that
shew of a godly life is a good
motiue to others to liue godly
indéed: and as a good life
giues comfort & encouragement
to others to be good, so
the president of euill makes
many euill. If greatnesse and
goodnes goe together, it is the
swéetest consort yt a mortall
man can make in this life, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
the contrary as harsh & hellish.
               
                  
This holy desire of Dauid
was not for a day, for hée
speakes of the time past. I
desired, which implies a continuall
inward Petition; and
argues his constancy in desiring,
though he were often
in such straits and distresses
as he could not visit the materiall
temple as he desired;
yet, wheresoeuer he was driuen
by the malice and rage of
his enemies, he euen there
found Bethel, the house of
God; in the Wildernesse of
Ziph, in the holds of Engedy,
in Maan and Gath, vncoth
and solitary places: hee
found the Lord his God euen
in his holy Temple, for
where God is present there

is his Temple. In the Lions
den Daniel found him; in the
Furnace the three children;
in the Dungeon Ieremy; in
the Prison Peter; vnder the
stones Stephen; in Sodom
Lot; in the floud Noah: God
is euery where, where hée is
called vpon faithfully.
               Euery faithfull childe of
God is alwaies in Gods
house, where Dauid desired
so earnestly to dwell: yet
though he found God euery
where where he called vpon
him, he had an earnest desire
to bée conuersant, euen in
that materiall temple where
the children of God did assemble,
to celebrate the praises
of God, and to heare his

Word: and though he were
their King, thought it no
disparagement, but the greatest
part of his duty to accompany
his subiects (according
to conueniencie) in the
holy exercises of Religion:
whereof being preuented by
meanes of his enemies, hée
complaineth that hée was as
a Pelican in the Wildernesse,
and as an Owle in the Desert:
And déemed the Sparrow
more happy than he, because
that silly Bird could at all
times resort vnto that holy
place to which he could not
come.
               
                  Lord (saith Dauid) who
shall dwell in thy Tabernacle?
and who shall rest in thy holy

Mountaine? that is, who
shall worthily enter into thy
holy Temple and behold thy
beauty? he answereth, Hee
that worketh righteousnesse,
&c. for God is holy and requireth
holinesse of life,
walking vprightly in a liuely
faith. And therefore though
it be the duty of all men to
frequent the materiall Temple
of God, to accompany
the congregation in prayer,
praising of God and hearing
his Word: yet all come
not with that holy desire that
Dauid did, nor qualified as
Dauid was: yet hée that is
vnprepared to day may bée
fit to morrow, for the Word
of God is as a Net, and often

times catcheth men ere
they bee aware: therefore
ought all men to desire as
Dauid did, to visit Gods
Temple, where this Net of
the Word is spread; for being
once taken, hee will then
with Dauid require that one
thing: namely, to dwell in
the house of the Lord all the
daies of his life, and often to
visit his Temple.
               
                  Dauid did not onely make
a bare request vnto God, but
did euen presse him, hée required
him as if he had béen
familiar with him, (as the
faithfull may vse a holy familiarity
with God in their
prayers) praying God to afford
him that blessing of blessings,

as to admit him into
his holy presence, wherein is
the fulnesse of ioy, and at his
right hand are pleasures for
euermore; not for a day a
moneth or a yéere, as worldlings
haue, and then perish,
but begun here and shall neuer
haue end.
               To dwell in the house of
Iehouah, is to dwell & abide
in his fauour, to be partaker
of his sanctifying grace, to
haue the true knowledge of
his diuine will, and to practice
it by faith, obedience,
zeale, prayer; and to beare
about vs the markes of the
Lord Jesus, in patient vndergoing
the burthen of the
Crosse, and in continuall exercise

of holinesse and righteousnesse:
whosoeuer is in
this case is safe in the holy
Temple of God as in a
safe Sanctuary, and is a
true member of the mysticall
body of our conquering
Christ, the head of that
Church which is the true
Temple, neither made with
hands, and which hands cannot
pull downe: Out of
which are barred all such as
trust in lying miracles, and
workes that cannot profit
such as steale, commit idolatry,
adultery; such as sweare
falsly, and such as fall downe
and worship false gods, or
the true God after a false
and idolatrous manner.
               
                  
Though these stand in the
materiall Temple, or seclude
themselues in Cloisters, in
séeming deuotion to sequester
themselues from the
world to God, and yet commit
many barbarous sinnes
and grosse impieties, thinking
themselues safe, and to
be reconciled to God by a
confessory penance, God will
not onely not heare them but
reiect them & their prayers,
for they seeme religious and
are not, obedient to God and
are not, faithfull and are
not: but are méere Hypocrites,
who resorting to the
Temple of God, commit rather
sacrilege than offer sacrifice
acceptable to God.

These visit not the Temple,
but rather defile if with their
counterfeit holinesse, who
would séeme in shew Saints,
but in heart enemies to
Christ and Christians; yet
cry they, the Church, the
Church; and yet farre from
being members of it. So
many séeming-good Christians
cry out, Preach, Preach,
and séeme neuer satisfied
with Sermons; this desire
is good, if their hearts desire
it to profit and practise the
word: but if it be but to séeme
religious, and inwardly retaine
their corrupt desires,
if they amend not their
waies and their workes,
séeme they neuer so holy they

are but Hypocrites: for this
is to bée in the Temple of
God by his Word preached,
to learne & to execute iudgement,
not to oppresse the
poore nor the stranger, the
fatherlesse nor the Widow,
not to deceiue nor to walke
after other gods, after riches
and pleasures. If this fruit of
hearing appeare in them,
they are no doubt of the family
and house of God, and
shall dwell in his Tabernacle
and rest securely vpon his
holy Mountaine, for they are
of the generation of the iust:
but there is a generation
(saith Salomon) that are
pure in their owne conceits,
and yet are not washed from

their filthinesse: they follow
the deuices of their owne
hearts, And assume vnto
themselues a peculiar manner
of seruing of God, not according
to the sincere truth:
but as God abhorreth all sacrifices
of vncleane things:
so doth hee all counterfeit
showes of sincerity.
               God admitteth not sinners;
namely, such as make
no conscience of sinne, to
come into his holy presence,
much lesse to dwell in his holy
Temple, though they may
séeme to honour him with
their lips: He detesteth their
forged sacrifices, and their
very praiers are abhominable,
though they pertake of

the holy Sacraments, and
performe outwardly other
diuine duties: Hee is not
pleased with them, neither
behold they the beauty of the
Lord; but his seuere and
fierce countenance is bent against
them.
               But such as desire with
the like affection as Dauid
did, to behold the beautie of
the Lord, and to visit his
Temple, are such as the
Lord enuiteth and willeth to
come, and louingly embraceth
them. They come not
for a spirt and away, but desire
to make their continuall
abode, where they may still
behold his beautie and his
glory; his louing kindnesse

and mercies towards them,
shewed in his word as in a
glasse, which appeareth more
swéet and amiable to the cies
of their sanctified soules, than
the most beautifull feature of
Angels. This most heauenly
beauty Dauid desired to sée, &
saw it; as Paul teacheth, saying;
That God cōmanded the
light to shine out of darknesse,
euen in our harts, that the light
of the knowledge of the glory
of God might shine in the
face of Iesus Christ, whose
glory we sée in the preaching
of his word; wherein he declareth
the riches of his glory
vpon the vessels of mercy,
which he hath prepared vnto
glory. This glory the more

the spirituall man beholdeth,
the more is he moued with
desire to sée more and more,
and can neuer be sufficiently
filled with that heauenly
Contemplation. Much were
the Disciples moued at the
sight of Christs transfigured
glory; in so much as they
desired to haue enioyed the
sight of it still, so glorious it
was, that their minds were
euen rauisht with the beauty
thereof. So Dauid desired to
dwell in the Temple of the
Lord; not for a day, but all
the daies of his life, to behold
the beauty, the goodnesse, and
mercies of God, reuealed in
his Word, and to exercise
himselfe in prayer.
               
                  
Where God is duly and
truly called vpon by a holy
Congregation, there appeareth
the glory and beauty of
Iehouah. There is the Arke
of the Lord, the presence of
the mighty God of Iacob:
whose glory filleth the Temple,
which the faithfull man
séeth with a spirituall eye;
but the carnall man, though
bodily present in the same
Temple, apprehendeth it
not. As when Paul was conuerted,
he saw the glory of
God shine vpon him; but they
that iournied with him,
though néere him, saw nothing.
So that God is onely
séene of them, to whom hée
pleaseth to reueale himselfe.
               
                  
This beauty of the Lord
shineth in the hearts of Gods
elect children, by the reuelation
of the holy Ghost, which
none séeth but themselues.
And they take such sweet delight
in the beholding of the
face of God in Christ, as
they doe receiue in their
soules the very Impression of
the Image of the glory of the
onely begotten Sonne of the
Father, full of grace and truth:
euen as Moses receiued thorow
the splendor of the glory
of God vpon Mount Sinai
in his countenance, such an
impression of that glory,
that the children of Israel
could not endure to behold
with their eies the glory

of his countenance.
               What remaineth then, but
that we neglect not the continuall
visitation of the temple
of God, to accompany
the Congregation in the hearing
of that heauenly Word,
to pray vnto God for his
blessings, and to giue him
praise for his benefits. And
the Lord open our spirituall
eies, that we may euen here
behold his beautie, and bee
hereafter pertakers of his
glory.
               
                  
                  A Praier for spirituall knowledge,
and increase of our
holy desires to visit the Temple
of God, to heare his
Word, to pray vnto him, and
to praise him.
                  O Gracious Lord God,
most louing, who reiectest
none that come vnto
thee with a perfect heart; and
none can come vnto thee vnlesse
thou call him, as well by
thy inward Grace as by thy
outward Word: Vouchsafe
according to the riches of thy
Grace to grant, that I may be
strengthned by thy Spirit in

the inner man, that Christ
may dwell in my heart by
faith, and that my whole spirit,
soule and body, may bee
kept blamelesse, to the comming
of the Lord Iesus. For
thou knowest, Lord, what I am
by nature, a man vnworthy
to enter vnder thy roofe, or to
presse into the place where
thine honour dwelleth.
                  For thou art a God that louest
righteousnesse, and acceptest
of such as are of cleane
hearts, and whose conuersations
are vpright before thee:
but I am a sinner and corrupt,
as all my fathers were; Cleanse
me therefore, O gracious Lord
God, in the bloud of Iesus
Christ, and make me fit to approach

thine holy Temple,
that I may see thy beautie,
and behold thy glory. Open
mine eares that I may heare;
prepare my heart that I may
vnderstand what thou teachest
in thy word: Enlighten
mine inward eies, the eies of
my soule, that I may see thee,
and take comfort in thy presence.
And open my lips, that
I may speake vnto thee in
faith, and answer mee againe
in loue. Teach mee that celestiall
language, that may moue
thee to heare me.
                  For what booteth it me to
come into thy house with
deafe eares, not to heare thee?
without attention, to vnderstand
thee? mute, and not be

able to speake vnto thee?
                  Yet I know, good Father,
that thou hearest them that
cannot speake, and thou
teachest them that vnderstand
not; and thou openest the eies
of them that see not: such is
thy loue towards vs, as thou
acceptest euen of the language
of heartie sighes, whither
they be for sinne, or for want
of spirituall graces: Thou
knowest the inward desires of
the heart, tending to good or
euill.
                  I am sorry, good Father,
that any corruption lurketh
in my defiled heart, to keepe
out that blessed guest thy Spirit.
I cannot of my selfe abandon
corruption: I cannot of

my selfe so mortifie my sinne,
but that the dregges therefore
will still remaine. But cast me
not out of thine holy Temple,
because I am a sinner; but
rather, because I am a sinner,
admit to visit thy Temple, to
heare thy Word, that I may
learne to liue more and more
obediently vnto thee.
                  Make thou my heart cleane
and I shall bee all cleane; so
shall I visit thine house to honour
thee, and comfort my
selfe by thy holy presence,
and shall take spirituall pleasure
in thy beautie, and be finally
pertaker of thy glory.
                  Thou louest righteousnesse,
O make me righteous: Thou
hatest iniquity, abandon my

sinnes: Knit my heart vnto
thee, that I may both feare
and loue thy name. Giue me a
holy desire to seeke thee, and
to serue thee, both in the materiall
Temple with thy people,
and in all places, at all
times; for thou art euery
where to be found. And where
thou art, there is thy house;
for thou dwellest not in Temples
made with hands, but in
the heauens, and in the hearts
of them whom thou hast sanctified.
                  Turne thy face vnto me, O
Lord, for thy face I seeke:
Shew me thy beauty and glory
of thy countenance, and
change mee into thine owne
Image by thy Spirit, and in

the same Spirit admit me continually
to visit thy holy Temple.
                  Make my heart stable and
vnblameable before thee in
holinesse, that I may serue
thee with a sincere and pure
heart, and conscience vndefiled:
That I come not into
thine house onely to seeme religious,
but in true faith and
due reuerence, and giue thou
a blessing vnto my godly desires,
Amen.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 5.
                  In the time of trouble he shall
hide me in his Tabernacle,
in the secret place of his
Pauilion shall he hide mee,
and set me vpon a Rocke.
               
               
                  THe very name of
Trouble is fearefull
to a worldly
man, for he loues
pleasure & ease,
and when trouble commeth,
he is cast downe, and is (as
it were) at deaths doore: but
the true childe of God being
fore-warned, that if he will
liue godly, he must looke for

and prepare himselfe to suffer
trouble and affliction in this
life: Trouble therefore doth
little or nothing moue him
when it commeth, because
when he first entred into the
schoole of christianity, he learned
that the loue of God, & the
loue of the world, could not
stand together with his profession,
and that there is a
kinde of enmity betwéene the
children of God and the loue
of the world, or at least no
agréement; And that is the
cause that the good are most
afflicted, and the worldlings
prosper most: The first are
innocent, in whom there is
neither gall nor bitternesse;
the other, as they are couetous,

so are they commonly
proud and enuious. The first
is commonly iniured, and
beares it with patience: the
other triumphs ouer them
that resist them not, but
haue onely in all their troubles
recourse vnto God,
whose they are, being assured
that he in the time of
trouble will be their defence,
and hide them in his Tabernacle,
which was onely godly
Dauids refuge, being often
and many waies afflicted, as
at large before appeareth.
               God sendeth affliction vpon
his owne dearest children,
when oftentimes he letteth
the wicked goe frée; yet is
not God vniust in this, nor

partiall, in sparing the euill,
and punishing the good. Hée
hath his ends in both, according
to his heauenly wisdome,
who knoweth how to
deale with both. And he that
séemeth most to be spared,
and thinkes himselfe in best
case, is in greatest danger;
and he that séemeth in most
danger, is néerest greatest
happinesse: Howsoeuer indiscréet
men measure their
felicity by this worlds fulnesse,
and fréedome from
troubles; and censure the
dearest children of God to be
surely out of his fauour, by
reason of their manifold afflictions.
And yet they sée
that the simple nurse, though

she loue her Infant neuer so
dearely, she will weane it
from the breast by some bitter
thing, when she thinkes
her milke not good for the
childe; And that a Father, if
he loue his childe, will with
the rod of correction restraine
him from things dangerous.
And thinke they, that our
heauenly Father thinkes it
not fit to weane his owne
children from this hurtfull
world, that they perish not
with worldlings? But when
he striketh the wicked, it is
in his anger, as the beginning
of their perpetuall sorrowes,
by whose seuere punishments
here, his owne
children may bee terrified

from committing like sins,
by example of their punishments.
               
                  Hee that will liue godly
must suffer affliction; yet not
aboue their strength, for God
putteth to his hand, to moderate
and mitigate the weight
of their burden. The troubles
and afflictions of the
faithfull séeme more intolerable
to the beholders, then
to themselues that seele them,
and haue a liuely faith and
constancy to beare them:
Great and many are the troubles,
euen of the righteous;
but God deliuereth them out
of all. In the time of trouble
he hides them in his Tabernacle,
in the secret place of his

Pauilion shall he hide them,
and set them vpon a Rocke.
He hid Dauid from Saul, and
Moses from Pharaohs murderers:
his Tabernacle is
alwaies open to entertaine
them, that in their troubles
fly for shelter to him: His
fauour is the Rocke that cannot
be mooued; his prouidence,
the mountaine of their
rest and refuge.
               Troubles are but for a
moment, and then commeth
comfort; therefore doe the
children of God with patience,
great alacritie and ioy
vndergoe them. But contrary,
the comfort of the wicked
is here short and momentany;
but the
                     •
                  r future miserie

shall haue no end.
               Séeing then that no man,
especially such as are Gods
dearest children, can liue here
in this earthly Pilgrimage,
but he must looke for and endure
troubles: Who will not
then prepare himselfe with
constancy and patience to
embrace them when they
came?
               The holy Ghost by the pen
of godly Dauid, hath assured
the poore oppressed & afflicted
children of God, neuer to be
forgotten: Their hope shall
not perish for euer, for God
is not an idle obseruer, or a
carelesse spectator of the afflictions
and miseries▪ of
those that are his: Though

he suffer thē to be oppressed
long; as some with enemies,
as Dauid; some by losse of
goods, as Iob; some by imprisonment,
as Ioseph; some
with sicknesse, as Hezekiah;
and withall to permit the
wicked to mocke and deride
them, for that they trusting
in God, are suffered thus to
be afflicted; and notwithstanding
their praiers not to be
deliuered or reléeued, which
is no small tentation. But
these men looke into the outward
prosperity of men, and
commend them, entertaine
them, embrace them; as if
all cause of loue were due to
them that were loaden with
lucre, As for the poore, they

are despised, contemned, and
had in continuall derision, of
such onely indeed as are
blinde, and sée not; ignorant,
and know not; dull, and obserue
not, That there is a
God that careth for such as
worldlings cast off: that hee
embraceth his poore that the
wealthy despise, and that he
loueth them that the worldlings
hate; And that in the
time of trouble hee hideth
them in his Tabernacle, within
the secret place of his Pauilion
shall hee hide them:
Nay, the very Angels of
God (whom man séeth not)
pitcheth round about them
that feare him and call vpon
him, and deliuereth them;

therefore though the godly be
poore, the Lord thinketh on
them.
               Many a meane contenmed
childe of God, (hauing little
m
                     •
                  anes) by the blessing of
God, doe eat with more contented,
and more salutary
saturity, than many times
doe the most wealthy of the
abundance of all their table
dainties: A little that the
righteous hath, is better than
the abundance of the vngodly
rich. Let no man therefore
faint nor feare, when trouble,
affliction, or persecution
commeth; but rather reioyce,
knowing that tribulation
bring
                     •
                  th forth patience; and
patience, experience; and experience,

Hope; and Hope
maketh not ashamed; but
assureth the faithfull of the
goodnesse and loue of God,
which is shed abroad in our
hearts by the holy Ghost: so
that howsoeuer we be scorned,
we néed not blush at our
troubles and afflictions, but
at our sinnes that procure
them: yet are they vnto the
children of God but wholesome
medicines to cure
them, and to preuent them:
onely vnsauory to the carnall
minde, which also doe accustome
to patience, which by
experience cherisheth and
confirmeth our hope, which
through faith is an assured
testimony vnto our conscience,

that we are beloued of
God, so much the more, by
how much he kéepeth vs vnder,
and in obedience through
afflictions. For, if he leaueth
vs vnto our owne corrupt
conuersations without correction,
so much the stronger
grow we in sinne: therefore
necessary it is, that we should
often féele his correcting rod,
lest at the last he should confound
vs with his deuouring
sword; for if we should bée
without trouble, which is
our correction, whereof all
Gods children are partakers,
we could not but account
our selues bastards,
and no sonnes: And if his
corrections kéepe vs in obedience,

then wée may assure
our selues, he will hide vs in
his Tabernacle, that no power
or policy of the wicked
shall finde vs out to hurt
vs.
               As men are in number
many, and their affections
diuers, & none liueth without
some trouble or affliction,
not all in one measure or
in like degrée: so is euery
man comforted or cast down
according to the measure of
his faintnesse or faith, for
many men may bée equall
partakers of one and the
same trouble, yet not of equall
resolution to beare it.
               Some men haue great afflictions,
and beare them

with great patience; some
small, and yet cry out vnder
the burthen of them; some
men haue many troubles
and yet account them few;
some few, and yet account
them many; some haue fearefull
afflictions, yet they repute
them fauourable; some
very fauourable crosses, yet
esteeme them very fierce and
cruell; some haue long and
tedious afflictions, yet supposed
short; some very short,
yet conceiued long and cumbersome.
               This ariseth onely of the
difference of mens faith and
frailty. The first is bold and
strong, able to beare and vndergoe
whatsoeuer it pleaseth

God to lay vpon them;
saying with faithfull Dauid,
God is my hope and strength
and my portion. The second
is weake and sinketh vnder
the burthen of most easie trialls,
because they cannot say
in their hearts as Dauid did,
the Lord is my rocke and my
saluation, nor assure themselues
yt 
                  God will hide them
in his Tabernacle, in the secret
place of his pauilion.
               
               And what is this hiding
of his Saints, but his continuall
watchfulnesse ouer
them, and his prouidence in
keeping and defending them?
hee sets them vpon a rocke,
namely, hée taketh them into
his owne protection, and

none is able to take them out
of his hands; therefore are
they constant in all their
troubles, let them lose their
children: let them be robbed
of their goods, afflicted in
their bodies, vpbraided of
their enemies, condemned
for Hypocrites, persecuted
as Heretikes, or brought to
extreme pouerty; let them
endure all these and more
troubles with holy Iob, yet
will they retaine their constancy
& confidence in God,
still knowing that hée in
whom they trust is faithfull
in his promises; and his power
is absolute, and that in
the time of their trouble hee
will hide them in his Tabernacle,

in the secret place of his
pauilion, hee will hide them
and set them vpon a rocke.
               
               There is no trouble, triall
or affliction of what kinde
soeuer, but the dearest and
most beloued of God haue
béene partakers of them. Abel
was murdered by Cain
his wicked brother for his
sincere worship of God.
Faithfull Abraham was not
free from troubles, from
doubting and feare; he was
commanded to offer his dearest
sonne Isaak in sacrifice,
in whose séede the generall
blessing was promised: being
afraid of his life, for his
wiues sake, was twice driuen
to faine vntruths, both

to Pharaoh in Aegypt, and
Abimelech King of Gerar:
Hée had trouble by Lot his
brother, he had griefe for the
destruction of Sodome, besides
many other troubles.
Isaak likewise for feare of his
life for Rebeccah his wife, by
his vntruth exposed her chastity
to the will of a heathen
King: he was afflicted by the
Philistines, he was crossed in
his desire of preferring Esau
before Iaakoh in the blessing.
Iaakob was forced to flie out
of his owne Country, and
from his friends, and to be a
seruant in a strange land, for
feare of his brother Esau, that
threatned to kill him: being
enuied by Labans his Uncles

sonnes, he fled with his
wiues and children, he was
pursued by Laban: hée was
encountred by an Angel that
wrestled with him all the
night, shooke him fearefully
and lamed him: he marched
in great feare and perplexity
with his wiues children and
droues, towards his offended
brother Esau, who came
against him with foure hundred
men: he was miserably
tormented for the supposed
death of his dearest sonne Ioseph,
and much perplexed for
his sonnes murthering his
neighbour Seehemites. Ioseph
was guiltlesly accused
and wrongfully imprisoned.
Moses was like to haue béene

slaine by the Angell in the
Inne, for not circumcising
his sonne, preuented by Zipporah
his wife, who after
circumcised him, and cast the
fore skinne of her sonne at
Moses féet, saying, Thou art
indeed a bloudy husband vnto
me: many other troubles
he had for the disobedience of
the people of Israel. Not one
of Gods children haue béene
frée from troubles, therefore
let none refuse to take vp the
Crosse of Christ, who in his
owne person suffered many
reproaches, ignominies, and
at last the death of the crosse
for vs: None of his Apostles
escaped most cruell torments,
some were stoned to

death, some slaine with the
sword, euery of them had
their troubles and torments,
and all the Fathers of the
Primitiue Church had their
seuerall miserable ends for
Christ, and yet tenderly be
loued of God. Shall wée
then that haue the like and
the same benefit by the death
of Christ, be ashamed of his
Crosse? Shall we thinke to
enioy his glory, and shall we
suffer none of his disgrace?
We are his members, and
he is our head, and shall our
head suffer and wée liue at
ease?
               Satan is malicious, hée
can endure none that liueth
vprightly, but hée will vse

his instruments to molest
them; if hée cannot induce
them to sinne against God
with a high hand, hée will
procure them troubles, and
such as wherewith if it were
possible, he would so weaken
their faith in God, that they
should vse any vngodly
meanes to frée themselues;
and will perswade them that
God punisheth none but
such as he hath no loue vnto:
but the truly faithfull know
that he is a lier from the beginning,
and therefore will
not giue eare vnto his false
suggestions; and therefore
when any afflictions doe befall
them, they will take them
as indéed they are, Gods louing

corrections and wholsome
preseruatiues, to kéepe
them from all things that
may offend God, and will
in their troubles séeke no
other refuge, but (as the little
Chiekens flye to the
wings of the Hen) so they
runne and hide-themselues
in Gods protecting Tabernacle,
who is ready to receiue
them into his sauing
pauilion, and to set them vpon
the rocke of his saluation.
               Experience hath found it
a dangerous thing to liue in
carnall security and without
trouble; as long as Dauid
was pursued by his enemies,
as long as he was visited

with troubles, he could
séeke the Lord, he was exercised
in continuall prayer,
and finding God ready to
helpe him, he could say, I will
goe forward in the strength
of the Lord, then he could declare
that God was his defence,
and that he should neuer
bée confounded: But
when he had no enemies, and
all his troubles were remoued,
he forgat that euer hée
was in danger, hée liued at
ease, tooke his pleasure and
delights, walking without
feare on the top of his house
securely, delighting himselfe
in his pleasant prospects,
and behold a woman bathing
her selfe; then his heart

which was before set vpon
God, was set on fire of lust,
& committed grieuous sins
without remorse, vntill God
sent Nathan to put him in
minde of that which hee had
forgotten a whole yeere together,
then was he stricken
with another kinde of feare,
not of humane enemies, but
of Gods iustice, and where
before hee continually besought
God to hide him from
his enemies, now he cryeth,
Haue mercy vpon me▪ O God,
according to thy louing kindnesse,
according to the multitude
of thy mercies, put away
mine iniquities. I know my
iniquities, and my sin is euer
before me. Sinne we see is

the fruit of security, and by
that godly mans example, it
appeareth that some troubles
are better than a quiet
and secure estate, as appeareth
also by Hezekiah, who
being magnified in the sight
of all Nations, and was free
from feare of trouble, he became
proud, his heart was
lifted vp; but when God had
sent him an enemy Senacherib,
to rouse him by threats, &
sicknes to afflict him, then he
became humble, then he fel to
his prayers to God, and God
then did hide him in his Tabernacle,
in the secret place of
his pauilion did he hide him,
& in his sicknes set him again
vpon the rocke of health.
               
                  
Gods owne children are
knowne by his fatherly correcting
them: and they that
come into no troubles in this
life, liue they neuer so carnally
contented, may suspect
themselues, and may be suspected
to be none of his: and
therefore faith Eliphaz to
Iob, Blessed is the man whom
God correcteth and afflicteth
here. If then affliction and
troubles be the way to become
blessed, or at least an
argument of Gods fauour;
with what patience should
we endure them; nay, with
what ioy should we embrace
them? Saint Paul accounted
the afflictions of this present
life, not to be worthy of the

glory which we shall enioy
hereafter.
               Why therefore should we
feare or repine against trouble,
séeing it is so necessary
for vs? It is not yet meant,
neither is it required of vs
voluntarily to runne into, or
to séeke troubles, as some
Vo
                        •
                     aries do wilful pouerty &
other néedlesse crosses, which
is not onely not required
of them of God, but offensiue
vnto him, being méere idlenesse,
one of the sinnes of Sodome.
It is required of vs,
onely when troubles of what
kinde soeuer befall vs, to
vndergoe them with patience,
faith and constancy;
and then shall God hide vs in

his Tabernacle, in the secret
place of his Pauilion shall hee
hide vs and set vs vpon a
Rocke. To him let vs commit
our soules in well doing
as vnto our faithfull Creator,
knowing that we are not
afflicted by chance, but by the
will of God our most louing
Father in Jesus Christ, the
Rocke of our saluation; him
let vs séeke in trouble, and to
him let vs pray.
               
                  A Prayer in whatsoeuer
trouble.
                  O Lord my God in Iesus
Christ, who art onely

wise in disposing all things
for all men, and to whose
will all creatures in Heauen,
Earth and Sea are subiect; and
none, be he neuer so mighty,
can withstand what thou wilt
haue done: Open thine eyes
and behold me, open thine
eares and heare mee, open
thine hands and releeue mee.
I am in trouble, not by
chance, but of thine owne wil;
not in thine anger to destroy
me, but in thy loue to reforme
me; my sinnes I doe confesse
haue offended thee, and yet
are they strong in mee, it is a
deadly disease which none can
cure▪ but thou through the
bloud of thy sonne; O wash
me throughly from mine iniquity,

& cleanse me from my
sinnes, vse not thy seuerity against
me, O Lord, for I were
neuer able to abide it: but as
thou hast begunne gently to
correct me, so proceed not as a
iust Iudge, but as a louing Father;
so shall not I wax worse
and worse, but shall grow
from vertue to vertue, from
faith to repentance, and consequently
to newnesse of life
by thy spirit.
                  Make therefore thy corrections
light vnto me by thy
supporting hand, that though
they be many, they exceed
not my power to beare them,
for I am of my selfe weake, but
assisted by thy spirit, I shall
become strong; and though I

be ignorant how to ease mee
of this burthen, he shall teach
mee that repentance, that
through faith in thy Sonne,
shal procure the mitigation of
mine afflictions: though they
be many and of diuers kinds,
they are all knowne of thee,
and all necessary for mee, because
thou hast sent them, and
that not in vaine, for all worke
and worke together for my
good through thy blessing.
                  I am cast downe, I am
brought low, I am scorned,
because of my basenesse and
troubles, but I beare it, and
keepe silence when I heare
the vpbraidings and contempt
of my late familiars,
who abandon my ancient-society,

because they wax aloft
and I become low: this yet
comes not to passe without
thee, thy hand is in euery action
for the good of thine: if
enemies assaile me, thou biddest
them; if pouerty and
want oppresse me, thou sendest
it; if sicknesse afflict me,
thou doest it; and therefore
good: and none of these shall
exceed my strength, through
thy strength. As for mine enemies
thou canst bridle
them, for pouerty and want
thou canst supply them, for
sicknesse and carnall infirmities
thou canst cure them: all
these haue their turnes to visit
me, onely to turne mee to
thee.
                  
                     
Lord I come vnto thee, reiect
me not, I pray vnto thee,
deny me not; but as thou hast
eares to heare; and eyes to see,
euen from Heauen, heare my
prayers and behold mine afflictions;
they are great, yet
they shew the greatnesse of
thy loue, that wouldst not
that I perish, therefore imbrace
I thy corrections as a
gentle yoke, not heauy but only
to my carnall part, to which
euery crosse seemeth a curse,
and euery medicine seemeth
mortall.
                  Beare with my weaknesse
Lord, and lay not much trouble
vpon mee, but according
to the measure of mine affliction,
let the measure of my

patience be, and the measure
of thy mercies aboue measure.
                  And as thou obseruest my
sinnes, so consider what correction
is fit for my reformation;
I know thou art iust,
but most sweetly tempered
with mercy, yet no equality
betweene thy mercy and thy
iustice, for all thy waies are
mercy and truth, and there is
no iniustice in thy feuerity,
for thou shewest mercy to
whom thou wile shew mercy,
and executest iustice iustly.
                  Who then can complaine
in whatsoeuer sharpe affliction?
when all mens sinnes are
the cords that draw them vpon
them, and no man deserueth

thy mercy to bee freed
from them, therefore disclaime
I any merit of mine,
Lord, to bee released, and
craue onely mercy, for thou in
thy mercy wilt blesse the righteous,
and with fauour wilt
compasse him about as with a
shield, so that no affliction,
crosse or trouble shall be too
heauy for him.
                  Thou Lord hast promised
to be a refuge for the poore,
yea a refuge in due time, euen
in greatest afflictions. O hide
me therefore in thy Tabernacle,
in the secret place of thy
pauilion hide me, and set me
vpon a sure rocke.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 6.
                  That he will now lift vp my
head aboue mine enemies
round about me: therefore
will I offer in his Tabernacle
sacrifices of ioy, I will
sing and praise the Lord.
               
               
                  
                     DAuid hauing
bin long beset
with enemies
(after
he was
cōstituted &
also anointed King by Samuel)
by the malice of
Saul, who sought his death,
and continued many yéeres

in continual troubles, wherin
being exercised, he betooke
himselfe to prayer to God,
liuing in hope that the time
would come wherein hee
should be fréed from Sauls
tyranny, and as hée was anointed,
so should he bée at
length eustalled King, hauing
in many yéeres little or no
breathing time, or freedome
from afflictions, yet was his
faith strong, and his confidence
in God firme, as appeareth
by the first, second
and third verses of this 27.
Psalme, wherein hée declareth
the fauour of God towards
him, that he was his
light and his saluation, and
his strength, so that he feared

not Saul, nor whatsoeuer
wicked enemies, being assured
that if they came vpon
him to take away his life,
God would make them to
stumble and fall, as by his
owne hands and Gods prouidence
Goliah fell, and after
Saul his enemy by his owne
sword: so that in the first
Uerse hée tooke courage
through faith in God, and
sang, In the time of trouble
God shall hide me in his Tabernacle,
in the secret place
of his Pauilion shall he hide
me and set me vpon a Rocke.
And in this verse, Now shall
hee lift vp mine head aboue
mine enemies round about
me.
               
               
                  
When Saul was dead his
mighty enemy, he tooke the
Gouernment of his Kingdome,
but was not yet frée
from enemies; whereby wée
may see, that the death of one
enemy is the life of another;
and to teach vs not to be secure
at any time, but when
one danger is past, to looke
for another: yet not without
Hope, though cast downe, in
the end to be lifted vp and
raised againe. For as the
Moone wareth full, and decreaseth
and the Sea ebbeth
and floweth, and as the sky
cleareth and cloudeth; so doe
the estates of men, high and
low, rise and fall, and fall
and rise. What a fall had

                  Ioseph, being the darling of
his Father, to be sold as a
slaue, to be falsely accused,
and to be strictly imprisoned,
and yet in the end to bée so
highly aduanced?
               
                  Now, saith Dauid, shall
he lift vp my head: as if hée
could limit God the time to
raise him. No doubt, it was
not his meaning to tie God
to a certaine time: but when
Saul his Predecessor was
dead, & the Crowne open sor
him, he might well say▪ 
                  Now,
that is, now hath God appointed
the time to bring
that to passe, which long before
he had promised.
               Indéed when he was made
King, he might well say, that

                  God had lifted vp his head aboue
his enemies round about
him; for he had many, as before
is shewed, and net a few,
euen of Sauls followers after;
who when they saw Dauid
exalted, might enuy his
aduancement, being lifted vp
so farre aboue them, and had
then power to recompence
their wickednesse against
him. But he had no reuengefull
spirit; if he had had, hée
would haue reuenged himselfe
vpon Shemey, that railed
on him, and cursed him;
and vpon Doeg, that discouered
his abode to Saul: Neither
of these did he touch, but
as touching Shemey, though
he swore vnto him that hée

would not slay him; yet hée
commanded Salomon, that
he should cause his hoare
head to goe to the graue with
bloud: which it séemeth hée
spake by the spirit of prophesie,
fore-séeing that he should
die by the sword.
               Thus Dauid deliuered
from his enemies, and lifted
vp aboue them, sheweth the
wonderfull power of God in
preseruing him, and his prouidence
and loue in aduancing
him, yet continued hée
not long without his troubles,
and enemies to exercise
him, though he were now
established in his Kingdome:
for he hauing peace & security
a while, we find into what

sinnes he fell, though he were
aduanced aboue his corporall
enemies, his spirituall foes
grew stronger than he; therefore
it is good that the children
of God, though neuer
so great in the world, haue
afflictions and troubles, lest
they forget God, as this godly
King for a time did, yet
vpon repentance God raised
him againe: Which example
of sinning we must auoid,
and imitate his repentance.
               By his assured confidence
in God he still withstood, and
preuailed against all that
rose vp against him: none
could make him afraid, but
rested still assured that God
would now, namely whensoeuer

he was beset with danger,
lift vp his head aboue all
his enemies round about
him: His enemies in their
policies, became fooles; in
their strength, weake; and
all their deuices brought to
nought. So that Dauid might
well sing this ioyfull Song,
The Lord hath lifted vp my
head aboue all mine enemies
round about me.
               
               Nothing preuaileth without
or against God: None
can be lifted vp to sit safely
without God: therefore the
man that is wise being aduanced,
will-imitate Dauid
in faith, and a holy resolution:
then shall he mount that
rocke that shall neuer bee

moued, God shall maintaine
his lot, so that troubles shall
not dismay him, enemies
shall not hurt him, neither
shall any thing make him afraid.
               None must yet stand in
conceit, that Dauids infirmities
and falls should bée a
priuilege for them to commit
sinne; but rather let his fall
be a-motiue to them, to bée
watchfull ouer their waies,
for the preuenting of like
danger, and to beware of security:
For easie it is for a
man to fall of himselfe, as
Dauid did, but without God
not to rise againe, and repent
as Dauid did. Though he fell
and was lifted vp, Saul fell

and neuer rose; Peter fell and
rose againe; but Iudas fell,
and that finally.
               
                  Dauid had an eie vnto his
waies, and respect vnto his
walkings, to preuent a second
fall, so as his enemies
could not preuaile: yet hée
confessed, that it was the
Lord that supported him,
and made him to abide in
safety. It was not his owne
power, or wit, or policy,
but the mercy of God that
preserued him, and that lifted
vp his head aboue his enemies.
He was constant, and
waited the Lords leisure▪ he
made not haste as hée might
haue done, hauing Saul twice
within his power: though he

were anointed King, yet
would he lay no violent
hands vpon him that was
pre-anointed and inuested,
but waited his time, as Ioseph
did, whose head was lifted
vp aboue his enuious
brethrer. Mordochay, and
the Jewes likewise with patience
waited the time, and
were lifted vp aboue H
                        •
                     man,
but otherwise, higher by the
gallowes than they.
               Many are lifted vp aboue
their enemies in conceit, and
yet themselues lifted vp as
enemies against themselues:
for the more man insulteth in
pride ouer other men, the
more the mighty triumph
ouer the weake, the rich ouer

the poore, the glorious ouer
the base: and the more that
they in authority abuse and
tyrannize ouer them they gouerne,
so much the further
off are they from the true lifting
vp, how high soeuer they
cary their heads: and so much
the more enemies they are
vnto themselues.
               There is no true lifting
vp without loue, for God is
loue, he lifteth vp the heart
and soule through faith aboue
the outward man, euen to
haue their conuersation in
heauen. This is the true and
swéetest aduancement, this
is the glorious lifting vp of
the head: And thus was Dauid
also lifted vp spiritually,

together with his outward
lifting vp, aboue his corporall
enemies.
               Many good men are aduanced
to honor and office; To
what end? Not onely not to
gaine earthly glory thereby,
or to enrich themselues by
sinister meanes thereby, and
to abuse their places, and
wrong their lifter and lifting
vp: but as Dauid being lifted
vp, did acknowledge it to
be the Lords doing: and as
he was aduanced by him, so
did he séeke by all meanes to
aduance his glory; and
though he were lifted vp aboue
his enemies, he insulted
not ouer them, but gaue God
the praise, that his enemies

triumphed not ouer him.
               Praise and thanksgiuing
are due vnto God, for euery
benefit and blessing hée bestoweth
vpon vs; and hée requireth
it, especially of them
whom he lifteth vp aboue
their enemies: and that they
be lowly in their owne eies,
and louing to all, euen to
their enemies. And to learne
also of Paul, in a low estate
to be patient, and being lifted
vp to be thankfull, neither
to be grieued at the one,
nor to glory too much in the
other: In the one, pray to be
constant; in the other, giue
glory to God.
               
                  Dauid, when he knew by
his anointing, that he should

be King after Sauls death,
continued yet humble, and
was yet contented to kéepe
his fathers shéepe (a meane
office, for a man anointed to
be a King) and thought it no
disparagement. And when
he was indéed exalted, hée set
not out his glory by outward
vanities: neither was hée
guarded with swaggering,
swearing Drunkards, and
with vile and vitious persons,
though with sufficient
noble attendants (his Worthies)
abandoning his house
of the knowne wicked, and
retained such into his seruice
as he found to feare God.
And in stead of worldly vain-glory,
he went into the Temple

of God, and there offered
the sacrifices of prayer and
praise: and not himselfe alone,
but called the people together,
and with them went,
not once, but many times into
the house of the Lord: He
was not ashamed, being a
King, to be the formost in
the seruice of God. And let
vs praise God for his like
mercy vouchsafed vnto vs,
and let vs imitate godly examples.
               Here is a liuely patterne of
a thankfull heart to God for
his aduancement, contrary
to the course of many, who
being lifted vp, not aboue
their enemies, but aboue
their equals; of whom many

giue rather thankes to their
owne wit and policy, and to
inferior meanes, friends, or
money. But such their aduancement
is but as the
building of Babel, & though
their language be not confounded
(but many times
changed) their manners often
altered: They rise without
God, and oftentimes we
sée them fall of themselues.
If therefore thou be exalted,
remember Dauid, by whom,
and by what meanes he was
lifted vp. He praied, and the
Lord heard him, and he gaue
the whole glory to God.
               Whatsoeuer thou art, bée
thou neuer so eminent, think
not praier and praising God

to be base exercises, or things
indifferent. They are the
works of Gods Saints, and
therein they exercise themselues
day and night. But
woe to them, that onely make
their praiers and suits vnto
men, forgetting God, and
that being lifted vp, offer the
sacrifice of praise vnto men
to their own deuices, to their
Siluer and Gold, &c. Forget
not God▪ that can winke at
ambitious mens lifting vp,
and laugh at their fals.
               But when God affordeth
lawfull means to lift vp any,
he giueth thē assurance of his
approbation, and if they pray
for good successe, they shall
prosper and profit the place

they execute, and the place
shall iustifie their integritie:
for, as without him, nothing
can come to good effect; So,
to whatsoeuer action he setteth
his helping hand, it cannot
but prosper: And he that
is by him lifted vp, let him
not forget to pray and to
praise God, lest he hurle him
downe againe, and his latter
end proue worse than the beginning.
               
                  
                  A Praier with thanksgiuing to
God, for defence from enemies,
in that they haue not
preuailed against vs.
                  O Eternall, most wise, most
louing, and most powerfull
Lord God, who guidest,
gouernest, and disposest all
things for all men, according
to thine owne will, and
knowest what is meet, necessarie,
and expedient for all those
that are thine; Grant that
whatsoeuer befalleth me here
in this mortall life, be it pouertie
or riches, prosperitie or
aduersitie, trouble or peace,
yea, if enemies rise vp against

me, all may be for my good,
for as much as nothing commeth
to passe but by thy prouidence
in loue.
                  Pouerty thou suppliest with
plentie, if thou seest it good
for me: troubles thou canst
remoue, if expedient, & canst
send me quietnesse and comfort;
enemies thou canst restraine,
and howsoeuer they
seeme to insult ouer me, thou
canst lift vp my head aboue
them: And though I bee
brought low, and for a time
endure disgrace, ignominy &
shame, euen among my familiars;
yet as long as it pleaseth
thee to accept and retaine
me in thy fauour, I shall not
be discouraged, being assured

that thou canst and wilt in
thy good time shew thy selfe
the God of my saluation: thou
wilt giue mee fauour againe,
euen of those that now scoffe
and deride mee for my miseries,
they shall againe receiue
mee in loue, seeing thy fatherly
respect vnto me: For
I know, that I seeking helpe
and comfort of thee, shall againe
reioyce and be glad in
thee: for though I be poore
and needy, though troubles
abou
                        •
                     d and enemies rage against
me, thou thinkest on
me, and according to thy promise
wilt neuer leaue me nor
forsake me: therefore if all the
world disdaine me, be thou
fauourable vnto me. O helpe

me and deliuer me from them
that afflict me, and saue me,
for I trust in thee; and none
that trusteth in thee shall bee
cast downe for euer. I powre
out my whole desire before
thee, my sorrowes and my
sighes are not hid from thee;
and though I seeme to faint,
and my heart to faile me, because
my louers and my
friends leaue me, by reason of
my miseries, yet I wait on
thee, for comming, I know
thy helpe will come: for thou
art an vpright Iudge, though
thou haue brought me low, I
know thou canst and wilt lift
me vp againe; and they that
thinke thou hast vtterly forsaken
me, shall see that there is

a God that hath a care of his
deiected people; though they
say now, Where is thy God
in whom thou seemest so
much to trust? Doth he helpe
thee or releeue thee? thou callest
vpon him, but he heareth
thee not; thou seemest to
seeke him, but findest no helpe
at his hands. O grieuous tentation
to a weake-minde: but
it daunteth me not, I am confident
in thy mercies; I faint
not at these reproaches, for
they vpbraid not me, but
thee, saying as it were in
their hearts, it is bootlesse for
the distressed to trust in thee.
                  O consider this, my God,
and permit mee not (though
sore oppressed) to giue ouer

calling continually and faithfully
vpon thee, for with thee
there is mercy, and with thee
is timely redemption: though
thou seeme to tarry long and
to giue no eare vnto my prayers
(which maketh those that
are ignorant of thy waies to
thinke thou hast vtterly forsaken
me) yet I know and am
assured that thou forgettest
me not; neither dost thou so
leaue mee but that thou wilt
returne vnto me again, and in
the multitude of thy mercies
lift me vp againe: and then
shall they that thus haue censured
me, finde and confesse,
that indeed I haue not trusted
in thee in vaine, and that
thou art a God indeed, powerfull,

able and louing, willing
and ready to helpe thine in the
time of most need: I am thine,
O Lord, for in all my troubles
I haue hitherunto found thee
my God, my helper, and my
refuge, though there be that
haue said there is no helpe for
me in thee, I haue found them
lyers, for thou hast neuer failed
me nor forsaken mee hitherunto,
neither wilt thou
faile me or forsake me for euer.
                  Thou hast euer beene my
rocke and fortresse, and hast
euer deliuered mee, therefore
art thou worthy to be praised,
yea I will praise thee, for I
was left vnto thee as soone as
I was borne, and thou hast
euer beene a louing father vnto

me: though as a father thou
hast gently corrected me, yet
thy louing kindnes thou hast
neuer withholden from me;
but when in my greatest troubles
and afflictions I haue
beene like to perish, thou hast
not left mee to the will of
mine enemies; and when they
they thought to reioyce most
at my miseries, thou hast lifted
vp my head aboue mine
aduersaries: in thee therefore
will I trust, and not be afraid
what man can doe vnto me.
Haste thee to help me, O God
of my saluation, and praised
bee thy holy name for euer,
Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 7.
                  Hearken vnto my voice, O
Lord, when I cry, haue mercy
also vpon me and heare
me.
               
               
                  THese words of Dauid
import a most
earnest praier vnto
God, though
séeming short, yet
cōtaineth matter of good consideration
euen of vs, yt in all
our necessities we should cry
vnto God, & teacheth vs that
when we are in distresse wée
may not lie still & thinke that
God will helpe vs, if we call
not vpon him; and againe we

may call and cry and not bée
heard. As Dauids enemies
when they were deseruedly
ouercome, cryed for helpe at
God, but he neglected them
and reiected them, because
they cried being a wicked
people in their distresse for
helpe at Gods hands whom
they before despised. But
contrarily, the children of Israel,
the people of God cried
vnto him in their distresse,
and the Lord heard them and
deliuered them, 1. Sam. 12.
10, 11. There are vocall
cries, and there are cries that
none heare but God, as the
guiltlesse bloud of Abel yet
cryeth vnto God for vengeance.
Likewise the sinnes

of Sodome and Gomorrah,
cryed vnto God for iudgement,
as sin and murther daily
doe: these are wofull cries,
silent, and yet God heareth
them in displeasure; whereby
wée may learne, that sinne,
and chiefely the murther of
Innocents, be it neuer so secret,
doe cry and shall be reuealed,
and though neuer so
séeming to be grounded vpon
pretended deuotion & zeale,
it crieth to God for vengeance.
               
                  Dauids cry was of another
kinde; for where the former
cries were the cries of the
sinnes of the wicked against
their wils, for reuenge against
their owne impieties;

                  Dauids tended to the glory of
God and his owne succour
and safetie: and therefore
said he, Hearken vnto my
voice, O Lord, when I cry;
Which teacheth vs not to bée
mute, when any occasion of
feare or affliction may moue
vs to séeke the helpe of God:
We must cry vnto God, not
vnto dumb stocks and stones,
nor to any dead creature or
Angell, whom they are fondly
framed to represent, but
vnto the liuing God; he onely
can heare, be our praiers
neuer so secret and silent. He
heard Moses and Anna, onely
mouing their lips without
sound. So that it is not the
loudnesse of the voice, but

the affection of the heart that
maketh the cry, where unto
God giues eare: many no
doubt can and doe cry Lord,
Lord, and that loud enough,
and yet they are not heard
because they cry not in faith.
And therefore Dauid did not
onely say, Lord hearken vnto
my cry, but withall craued
that God would haue mercy
vpon him, for men may cry
long enough and loud enough,
and not be heard vnlesse
GOD shew mercy.
Therefore saith Dauid, Hearken
vnto my voice when I
cry, haue mercy also vpon me
& heare me; for God heareth
no mans prayer but in his
mercy, and therfore is mercy
                  
in the first place so be sought,
but by faith, for he yt trusteth
in the Lord, mercy shall compasse
him about; though we
be in neuer so great misery
or danger, if wee cry faithfully
vnto God, he will heare
vs, and in his mercy helpe
vs: As Dauid complained
vnto God, saying, I am in a
wonderfull strait, let vs now
fall into the hands of the
Lord, (for his mercies are
great) and let vs not fall into
the hands of men. God sheweth
mercy vnto thousands
that loue him and kéepe his
Commandements, and heareth
them: but the wicked
and such as contemne his
Word he will not heare, for

they cry not in saith, they cry
onely for their owne necessities,
not referring the end
of their desires to Gods glory;
they cry of themselues
with the lips only, they come
in their owne names, and respect
onely themselues and
their owne outward wants,
and féele not nor acknowledge
their inward defects;
they are sinners and repent
them not, they aske therefore
and receiue not; They cry
vnto mee, saith God, but I
will not heare them, because
they pray without faith and
repentance. Therefore when
affliction & anguish shall fall
vpon them, they shall call vpon
me, but I will not answer;

they shall seeke me, but shall
not finde me. But the faithfull
afflicted he heareth, and
such as depart from their
sinnes and walke righteously
before him he considereth:
as Dauid himselfe confesseth,
I cried vnto the Lord,
saith he, and hee heard mee,
and deliuered mee out of all
my feare and trouble. They
that feare the Lord néed feare
no trouble, for mercy compasseth
them about, on euery
side Gods prouidence attendeth
them, & they no sooner cal
vpon God but hée heareth,
nay before they cry he is ready
to helpe them; for his eie
is euer vpon them, euen at
an instant to preuent whatsoeuer

danger; therefore may
the faithfull goe comfortably
forward in the strength of
the Lord trusting in him, and
they shall neuer be ashamed:
he is our strength and saluation
and our defence: let vs
powre out 
                     •
                  ur hearts before
him and say, Hearken vnto
my voice, O Lord, when I cry
haue mercy also vpon me and
heare me. Then will he assuredly
heare vs and helpe vs:
he will delay no further time
than may be for our good, hee
may séeme vnto vs long in
comming, but he will come
in a time conuenient, and his
delaies worke onely patience
and hope in vs, which if
these graces haue their perfect

working in vs, we shall
finde that he will neuer faile
vs nor forsake vs, howsoeuer
such as are ignorant of
Gods power and prouidence
may thinke, that vnlesse God
come at our first call he will
not come at all, which is an
argument they beléeue not
Gods promises, for if they
did they would make no such
haste, but wait the Lords leisure;
not that he is so busted
as he cannot intend either to
heare vs or helpe vs, for his
eare is alwaies open to
heare, and his hand alwaies
able to helpe euery man as
well as one, and that at an
instant; but we may not limit
the holy one of Israel, for

hee knowes the times and
seasons fit for euery of his
intentions; shall wee thinke
that Dauid in his extremest
dangers did not pray for deliuery,
yet though his saith
were great, he was not presently
set frée, though he cried
out, How long Lord, how
long, wilt thou absent thy
selfe for euer? Ioseph likewise
in his captiuity and
imprisonment, shall wee
thinke that hée cried not vnto
the Lord for deliuery,
and that instantly? and yet
he suffered him to endure the
very iron setters and stocks
vntill Gods appointed time
came, and then when the
counsell of the Lord had sufficiently

tried them, then he
deliuered them, and shewed
the abundance of his mercies
towards them in aduancing
them both: we may not therefore
murmure or repine at
Gods corrections, though
they continue in our opinions
long; it is not onely that
it is vnsauory to our carnall
mindes but for want of faith,
for where faith is strong it
produceth hope, and in hope
we wait with patience; and
we finde by experience that
hope and patience shall not
be in vaine. Then whosoeuer
is afflicted, let them cry
vnto God to haue mercy vpon
them, and that in a liuely
faith, and he will at least case

them, if hée doe not altogether
deliuer them: hee will
kéepe his owne vnder his
owne hand, and not suffer
them to haue the fréedome of
the raines at their owne
pleasure, knowing the vnrulinesse
of our owne na
                  
                     •
                  ure,
which if he curbe it not,
will runne into euery sinne,
and make no conscience of
any impiety: as we may sée
by holy Dauid himselfe, when
God permitted him but to
haue a little liberty, a small
breathing time from his
troubles; into what sinnes
did he runne, yet a man chosen
of God; if he so farre forgat
himselfe, how shall we
that haue not his spirituall

gifts refraine our selues
from offending God more
grosely in our security?
               Troubles and afflictions
fall not vpon vs without
Gods prouidence, though
Satan worketh what he can
to trouble vs, as appeareth
in his trying of Iob, to draw
vs from God, but howsoeruer
he aimeth to make vs distrust
God by his tentations
and afflicting vs, the
more doe the children of God
cleane vnto God for succour,
and cry vnto him for mercy:
and that which Satan intendeth
to be for our hurt, God
worketh it for our good, for
all things worke together for
the good of them that loue

God, and are called of his purpose,
namely, his owne elect,
who as they are truly Gods
owne, so they depend vpon
him alone, and know that
what crosse or affliction soeuer
befall them, it comes
from none but from their
owne louing father, for their
especial good to preuent greater
danger, as the holy Apostle
Paul himself confesseth, yt
                  lest he should be exalted out
of measure through the abundance
of reuelations, there
was giuen vnto him a pricke
in the flesh, the messenger of
Satan to buffet him, because
he should not be exalted out
of measure. God seeing our
corrupt nature, alwaies apt

to be puffed vp with a kinde
of pride and security, when
wee féele the abundance of
Gods graces and fauours
towards vs, in his wisdome
and mercy taketh downe our
ouer good conceits of our
selues by corrections: as Dauid
before he was afflicted
went awry; Manasses a great
Idolater, by troubles was
reclaimed, and then he praied
vnto God and humbled
himselfe; wée may sée it also
in the prodigall sonne, who
as long as hée had money to
bestow vpon his vanities
and lusts, he liued a rebellious
life against his father;
but when he was afflicted by
penury and want, he returned

home to his father, repenting
and crying vnto him
in effect as here Dauid doth;
O father hearken vnto my
voice, I cry vnto thee for pardon,
haue mercy also vpon me
and heare me, as much as if
hée had said, Father forgiue
mée.
               Gods corrections, though
grieuous and vnsauory for a
time, yet good and profitable
for vs, we are thereby the
more drawne from the delighting
in sinne, and made
more obedient vnto the will
of God, especially if they bée
seasoned with reuerence to
God that sends them with
faith, repentance, and feruent
praier: then shall wée

finde that they will bring vs
(being exercised with them)
the quiet fruit of righteousnesse:
Wherefore let vs not
onely not be discouraged at
the chastisements of God,
for they are in loue; but rather
make vse of them for
our humiliation, and vnfained
reformation. Adding
daily and continuall praiers
vnto God, who smiteth vs;
neither to kill vs orto maime
vs, but onely to kéepe vs in
awe, hauing a speciall eye
vnto his hand: for, when we
intend or are committing of
any sinne against God let vs
do as schollers do, who when
they are in their vnhappinesse,
haue one eie (as it

were) to sée whether the master
obserueth them or no,
and should giue them a clap
before they were aware: We
are to be as wary of the hand
of God, and as the maiden
of the hand of her mistrisse;
so shall God hearken vnto
our voice when we cry, hée
will haue mercy also vpon
vs, and heare vs.
               
                  A Praier, that God will haue
mercy vpon vs and heare vs.
                  HAue mercy vpon me, O
God, haue mercy vpon
me, for my soule trusteth in
thee, and in the shadow of

thy wings will I trust, vntill
mine afflictions come to an
end. I will call vpon thee, O
hearken vnto my voice when I
cry vnto thee, haue mercy also
vpon me, and heare me; But
how canst thou heare, vnlesse
I speake? Yes, Lord, I know
that thou hearest the very silent
sighes and groanes of the
faithfull heart. As for my vocall
voice, it is but the voice
of a sinfull man, but an outward
voice that soundeth but
in the aire, it only entreth into
the eares of man and beasts,
passing thorow the throat,
and soundeth by the lips, a
voice of no force, to pierce
the skies, to sound through
the clouds, to mount the heauens;

it is a low voice, a weake
voice; it ascendeth not where
thou, my louing God sittest,
in the heauen of heauens: and
therefore how can it procure
thine attention any thing at
all? Why then should I say vnto
thee, hearken? Why did
Dauid say vnto thee, hearken?
He was assured to bee heard:
Therefore I pray thee hearken,
O my God, Hearken
vnto the voice of my cry,
haue mercy also vpon me and
heare me. Heare the voice of
my renewed heart, the voice
of my soule that figheth for
my sinnes: haue mercy therefore
vpon me, O Lord, and
pardon me, that I may so cry,
and it may please thee so to

heare as I may heare thine answer
within, as I cry within.
Lord, let thy holy Spirit both
speake to thee, and answer
me: for I cannot preuailingly
cry vnto thee, vnlesse thou cry
in me by thine owne Spirit,
sanctifying my spirit, and answering
my spirit again by thy
spirit. Hearken, euen vnto thy
selfe, speaking in me; and let
my spirit heare thy spirit, speaking
to me, and in mee. So
shall my soule sound forth a
glorious voice, a sharpe and
piercing voice, a voice whose
sound shall ascend aboue the
clouds, where I haue a most
louing and preuailing Mediator
with thee, euen Iesus
Christ the righteous: in

whose name, and for whose
sake, thou wilt deny nothing
vnto those that come and cry
faithfully vnto thee. Then I,
euen I, shall heare a most sweet
and comfortable Eccho of
Grace resound in the eares of
my soule, that shall assure me
of answer of euery my petitions.
                  When I cry, Lord forgiue
me my sinnes, I shall heare, Thy
sinnes, O man, are forgiuen
thee: when I shall say, Open
thou my lips, I shall heare, Open
thy mouth, and I will fill
it: When I shall say, Lord I
beleeue, I shall heare, Thou beleeuedst,
therefore shalt thou be
saued: When I call for strength
in my tentations, I shall heare,

                     My grace is sufficient for thee:
When I shall call vnto thee in
my necessities for helpe, I shall
heare, I will neuer faile thee,
nor forsake thee. This is thy
goodnesse, O Lord, and thy
mercy, therefore will I euermore
pray vnto thee: O hearken
vnto my voice, when I
cry vnto thee, haue mercy also
vpon me, and heare me.
                  The ground of all my comforts
in all my troubles to bee
eased, is thy mercy; yea, thy
mercy onely. In mee there is
nothing worthy to bee regarded
of thee, it is thy mercy
only that maketh me to dwell
in safetie: And had it not
beene of thy free mercy, I had
bin confounded long agone;

therefore in thy mercy heare
me when I call vpon thee, and
in thy mercy releeue mee, in
thy mercy helpe mee. Then
shall neither enemies preuaile
against me, pouertie and want
shald not ouer-much oppresse
me, sicknesse shall not dismay
me, nor any outward or inward
trouble, sinne nor Satan
preuaile against me: For
thou, O God, art the God of
my saluation, my glory, the
God of my strength, in thee
will I euer trust. So be it.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 8.
                  When thou saidst, seeke yee
my face, mine heart answered
vnto thee, O Lord, I
will seeke thy face.
               
               
                  IN this verse, there
is (as it were) a
familiar conference
betwéene
the Lord and Dauid: God
saies vnto Dauid, and in the
plurall number, to all that
are his, Seeke yee my face;
And Dauid againe in the
name of the faithfull replies,
Thy face, O Lord, will I seeke.
It séemeth to be a strange

command, that we weake
Creatures that cannot looke
with stedfast eies vpon the
Sun, that is but one of his
inferior Creatures, but shall
be striken blinde with the radiant
beames thereof, should
séeke and behold his face,
which none could euer sée
and liue. And it séemeth likewise
to be as strange a promise
in Dauid, to say that hée
would séeke the face of God.
To séeke the Lord, is in many
places of Scripture enioyned
vs: but to séeke and
to sée his face, is not so frequently
commanded. But
these phrases of spéech differ
not, for both signifie the séeking
of his helpe, and are not

literally to be vnderstood, as
if God had a visible face to
be séene; or that he had a corporall
being to be felt. God
is a spirit, and spiritually to
be sought, and spiritually to
be discerned, and is not otherwise
to be séene, but in
the face of Iesus Christ, who
is also now glorified in the
heauens, not visibly to bee
apprehended by vs, vntill his
second comming.
               What is then meant by
the séeking of the face of
God? onely his fauour and
his protection in the time of
our danger: And to séeke
God, is to implore his power,
prouidence, and helpe in
our afflictions: As Ieremiah
                  
comforting the captiue Israelites
in Babylon: You shall
goe and pray vnto me, (saith
God) and I will heare you,
and if you seeke me, yee shall
finde me, if you seeke me with
all your hearts. And againe,
Azariah, said to Asa, Iuda and
Beniamin, The Lord is with
you while yee be with him:
And if yee seeke him, he will
be found of you; but if yee
forsake him, hee will forsake
you. God is present with
the faithfull by his continuall
helping power, as long as
they hold him fast by their
praiers, and wrastle with
him with their faithfull petitions,
as Iacob did with the
Angell, and cry vnto him till

he answer, and neuer leaue
seeking of him, till hee finde
him. If we séeke him in the
Word, wée shall finde him
there, as the spirit hath described
him, both a mercifull
God, and a consuming fire.
The faithfull finde him mercifull,
euen in this life: the
wicked shall finde him a seuere
Judge hereafter. The
first shall sée his face, and reioyce:
the second shall sée his
face, and tremble. The first
shall sée, and behold the beauty
of his countenance with
great gladnesse for euer: the
second shall sée his face for a
moment in his last sentence,
and that with horror.
               God saies vnto all, Seeke

yee my face, but few with
their hearts doe séeke him:
And that is the reason that
many call vpon him and are
not heard; they séeme to séeke
him, and finde him not: but
vnto the truly faithfull, hée
offereth himselfe as he did to
Moses; My presence shall goe
with thee, and I will giue thee
rest. This is the true beholding
of the face of God, to enioy
his presence; namely,
when he is ready in his power
and prouidence to helpe
vs in our afflictions, and to
deliuer vs in our dangers;
any other presence of his in
this life we néede not séeke,
his glory is aboue the Heauens:
What is man then

that he should séeke to sée his
all-glorious face here in
earth, which Moses saw but
in a bush obscurely, in respect
of his full and compleat glory;
and yet with that sight
his face did shine so, as the
people could not abide the
glory of his face? How much
lesse, the glory of the most vnspeakable
beauty of ye face of
ye most high? whose dwelling
is in the heauens, and whose
power is ouer all his works
in heauen and earth? And
therefore saith Dauid; O
Lord our God, how excellent
is thy name in all the world,
which hast set thy glory aboue
the heauens, where he sitteth
and séeth the troubles and afflictions

of his, and is néere
them when they call vpon
him, he turneth his face and
louing countenance towards
them, to cheare them and
comfort them; as for the
wicked, he beholdeth them a
farre off. I haue set the Lord
(saith Dauid) alwaies before
me, for he is at my right hand,
therefore I shall not slide: As
if he had said, I sée the face
of God continually: and hée
it is that preserueth me from
danger; so that mine heart
is glad, and my tongue reioyceth,
my flesh also doth rest
in hope. The tongue of men
or Angels cannot sufficiently
expresse what God is: onely
the heauens doe shew vnto

vs his glory, the Sunne,
the Moone, and Starres fixed
in the Firmament, the
Earth, the Sea, and all that
are therein, all being the
works of his hands. This
God did Dauid séeke, to this
God did Dauid pray, and hée
turned his face vnto him,
and deliuered him out of all
his feare: To him I will
pray.
               
                  A Praier that God will neuer
hide his face from vs.
                  THY fauour, O Lord,
which thou shewest vnto
vs, weake and vnworthy creatures,

is as an vnfathomable
Sea of loue, who becommest
(as it were) a suter vnto vs to
come to seeke and to see thy
face: Thou the most beloued
seemest to make loue vnto vs:
Thou the most mighty creator
callest vs vnto thee thy weake
creatures; And shall we, hatefull,
deformed, and vile wretches,
stand therefore in conceit,
that wee are louely and
beautifull, because thou, great
Iehouah, absolute in all perfection,
doest thus intreat vs?
Thou saiest, Seeke my face;
And what is it, but as if thou
saidst, Come and see me, come
and receiue me, come and dwell
with me. It seemeth to be rather
the voice of a familiar

friend, than of the Creator of
heauen and earth.
                  But when I consider thy
greatnesse, thy Maiesty, and
glory, thy power and omnipotency,
I cannot but feare,
considering what I am, and
rather desire to hide me from
thee as Adam did, than to intrude
my selfe into thy presence
in my deformities, and
to couer my nakednesse of all
goodnesse, with the fig leaues
of shamefull absence, than to
come into thy presence, being
naked of all spirituall vertues.
                  Should I come into thy
presence, O most powerfull
and holy Lord God, in the
bespotted garments of mine
owne corruptions? Then

maist thou well stand with the
burning sword of thy fury, to
keepe me from the sweet Paradice
of thy louing and amiable
presence: amiable in deed
to them whom thou makest
worthy, but most fearefull
vnto such as haue not on the
wedding garment of the
righteousnesse of IESVS
CHRIST. If thou obserue
the selfe-deseruings of the best
men, and deale with them
accordingly, who can see thy
face and liue? Who dare to
seeke thy face as of himselfe
worthy?
                  But sith it pleaseth thee to
call me, though vnworthy,
and to accept me as worthy;
how can I but giue all diligence

to attend thy call?
Should I stand consulting
with flesh and bloud, whether
I should seeke thy face
and liue; or remaine out of
thy fauour, and perish eternally?
                  Thou saist, Seeke my face:
O that my heart could truly
answer and faithfully performe
the seeking of thy face;
for I cannot say, of my owne
power, I will seeke thy face:
Though my spirituall part bee
willing, my carnall part is
weake. I desire yet to seeke
and to finde thee; for with
thee is the well of life: Thine
eies are vpon them that feare
thee, and thine eares open vnto
their cry. Shew me therefore

the light of thy countenance,
and turne thy face towards
me that I may see it, in
thy fauour and louing kindnesse.
                  Thy face is no way so liuely
to be seene, as in the Image
of thy Sonne, who although
he were here in the earth in
the forme of a seruant, he had
the inuisible forme of thine
owne Essence; and is now ascended
and glorified in the
heauens, endowed with that
absolute glory which hee had
from the beginning with
thee, whose visible forme
cannot bee seene with mortall
eyes, whose face yet shineth
more gloriously than it did
vpon the holy Mount, which

                     Peter, Iames and Iohn, to their
vnspeakable comfort, beheld
with their eies, that visible
glory of his cannot bee here
seene, it is hid from vs vntill
the time; but he vouchsafeth
vnto vs his Word,
wherein we see him through
faith.
                  O seeke his face euermore
my soule, seeke his Word, beleeue
his promises, obserue
his Will. Grant Lord that I
may flie sinne and embrace
righteousnesse; that I may
pray continually, loue all
men, beare with the weake,
bee patient in troubles, and
thankfull vnto thee for all thy
mercies, and grant Lord that I
may seeke thee while it is to

day, let mee omit no time
in seeking thy face: thou saist,
Seeke my face; let me cast off
all impediments and clogs
of worldly occasions, and cast
my care vpon thee, for thou
hast promised to care for
mee: what thou hast said
is true, what thou hast promised
is Yea and Amen; as
sure as if I were possessed of
what I aske.
                  I am in danger, I will
seeke thy face as Dauid did,
who found it in the Wildernesse
pursued by Saul. I haue
enemies, I will seeke thy face
as Eliah did, being threatned
by Iezabel. If I bee in prison,
I will seeke thy face as
Ioseph did, who was deliuered

and aduanced: what misery
or danger, trouble or affliction
soeuer it shall please thee
to inflict vpon mee, I will
seeke thy face, so shall I not
bee confounded in the perilous
time; and in whatsoeuer
calamity I am, be thou neere
vnto me and saue me.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 9.
                  Hide not thy face from mee,
nor cast thy seruant away
in displeasure; thou hast
beene my succour, leaue
me not, neither forsake me
O God of my saluation.
               
               
                  BY this prayer of Dauid
it may appeare
that God sometimes
hideth his
face from his dearest children,
and séemeth as if hée
had cast them away in his
anger, which yet though it
be fearefull, it is not small,
for he continueth not long in

his displeasure; though the
weaknesse of men (bée they
neuer so sanctified) will many
times shew it selfe, and
produce such corrupt fruits
as may incense God to displeasure,
and inforce him to
absent himselfe from them
for a time, in so much as he
may seeme to haue left them
quite to their owne corrupt
wills, as it séemeth holy
Dauid felt some alteration
as it were of Gods dealing
towards him, that he cried
out, hide▪ not thy face from
me, wherby it séemeth Dauid
had not that comfort of Gods
presence as in times past
he had, especially when hée
was afraid that God had cast

him away in displeasure. It
may be the weaknesse of Dauids
faith, (which is not at
all times alike strong) could
not so well apprehend Gods
mercies as before, or that he
felt his owne infirmities to
grow stronger, and his spirituall
powers weaker, so
that in the combat betwéene
the flesh and spirit, he found
his inward part the weaker,
and so suspecting as it were
the loue and presence of
God to aid the one and to
suppresse the other, hee
thought God had left him.
               But it séemeth his outward
enemies did more preuaile
against him than before,
and being so oppressed

by them or afraid of them, he
turned himselfe vnto God,
but he séemed to hide his face
from him, and therefore
praied so instantly that God
would not cast him away being
his seruant, in displeasure:
yet Dauid had the true
feare of God in his heart, although
hée were a little shaken
with doubting for the absence
of Gods presence; and
necessary it is, that wee
should sometimes feele the
want of Gods presence with
vs, that wee should not too
much presume vpon our
owne worthinesse, power
and strength, to stand firme
without him, for if he leaue
vs, be it neuer so little, such

is our frailty, that we begin
to faint, and our spirituall
strength saileth vs, which
if we can apprehend, it is an
argument that we are not altogether
destitute of the
grace of God, for if we be so
carried away with our owne
corruptions as we neuer féele
our owne wants of spirituall
graces, we haue no grace at
all. The wicked and such as
sinne without touch of conscience,
they neuer féele the
want of that they neuer had,
the spirit of God, & therefore
run on stil in their impieties,
following euery kinde of carnall
destres with greedinesse.
               It is not so with them that
God hath chosen and enlightened,

for they finde in themselues
the least of Gods absence
if but for a moment, for
they are seldome idle in one
kinde of holy duty or another;
they either meditate on
the word and works of God,
they pray or offer the sacrifice
of thankes to God, and
when they finde in them
selues a dulnesse to pray, or
ignorance how to pray, they
presently suspect that they
haue deserued by some
meanes that God hath left
them to themselues, who of
their owne power without
the helpe of the Spirit of
God cannot thinke a good
thought, much lesse faithfully
and seruently pray vnto

him, and then féeling the
griefe of their hearts that
they cannot be comforted by
the exercise of these holy duties,
finde the fault to bee in
themselues, and that God
for some sinne committed, or
some good dutie omitted, is
angrie with them. And therefore,
as Dauid doth here,
they crie out vnto God, O
hide not thy face from me, nor
cast thy seruant away in displeasure.
So fearefull are the
children of God, to lose the
benefit of his presence, as
they thinke nothing so irksome
vnto them as his absence;
and therefore haue alwaies
a kinde of holy iealousie,
that the least sinne they

doe cōmit, wil cause the Lord▪
to hide himselfe from them.
Therefore when Dauid considered
his infirmities, hée
could confesse and say, Wicked
deeds haue preuailed against
me, but thou wilt bee
mercifull vnto my sinne. God
is mercifull to them that are
sorry for their sinnes, which
sorrow and repentance is
the gift of God, and the children
of God instantly and
often call to God for it, as a
meane whereby they may redéeme
his loue and obtaine
his presence, and the beauty
of his face againe. And therefore
saith Dauid, being as it
were forsaken, and had lost
his chiefe comfort, the louing

countenan
                     ••
                   of the
Lord. Turne vs againe, O
Lord God of hosts (saith he)
cause thy face to shine, and we
shall be safe: Returne wee beseech
thee, O God of hosts,
looke downe from Heauen
and visit vs againe with
the brightnesse of thy louing
countenance, and hide
not thy face from vs, nor
cast vs away in displeasure.
There is nothing more causeth
the Spirit of God to
leaue vs than our sinnes, and
neglect of the true seruice of
God, and nothing retaineth
him more than the continuall
meditation of heauenly
things, seruent prayer with
a godly life; he that thus exerciseth

himselfe, hath God
alwaies with him, he hideth
not his face from such; but
in what misery, trouble,
feare or affliction they are,
they are sure either to receiue
outward deliuerance or
inward comfort, and to say
with Dauid, yet my soule keepeth
silence vnto God, of him
commeth my saluation; yet he
is my strength & my defence,
therefore shall I not much be
moued; not much, we may
haue some doubtings in our
heauy afflictions, and cry out
with Dauid, O God why hast
thou forsaken me; and though
we be moued, we shall neuer
be remoued from the louing
fauour of God; we shall neuer

fall finally into his displeasure,
though for a time
he séeme to hide his face from
vs, which he neuer doth vntill
we couet to hide our sins
from him, and to doe the
things which we thinke hée
séeth not; we may not thinke
that God hideth his all-séeing
cies from our transgressions,
though he turne not
his face towards vs to flatter
vs (as it were) in our
sinnes, for he loueth righteousnesse
and hateth iniquity;
righteousnesse and equity
are the establishment of his
throne, therefore dealeth he
iustly when he hideth his face
from them that deale vniustly,
from them that obey him

not, from them that neglect
to call vpon him in 
                     •
                  aith,
and omit those holy duties
which he requireth. How can
hee looke vpon them in loue
that leaue him? How can he
but hide his face, and as it
were, cast them away in his
displeasure that neuer séeke
him or serue him? Nay, that
séeke him not with a pure
heart, and that continually?
for it is not enough to sinne
and serue him by turnes, as
if he allowed vs a time for
our selues to take our carnall
pleasures & delights in,
and a time againe for him, to
haue our times wherein wée
cannot sinne, either being
glutted with sinne, or vnable

to sinne. How can hee but
hide his face from such?
How can it be, but he must
cast away such in his displeasure?
Dauid that thus
crieth out, that God had hid
his face from him, neuer
tooke such prophane liberty,
and yet through his humane
frailty, fell, and that grieuously:
but he lay not in it
as the reprobate doe; he examined
his heart, and found it
corrupt, and falted it with
the teares of repentance:
Thou hast fed mee with the
bread of teares (saith he) and
giuen mee teares to drinke.
This is the true medicine to
cure the soule that hath sinned,
Faith and Repentance.

And who so applieth it truly
to himselfe, as Dauid did,
shall finde ease; and although
God séeme sometimes to
hide his face, it is but to
cause vs the more to séeke
it, and though he séeme to cast
vs off in displeasure, it is but
as a louing father that dissembleth
extreme anger to
his childe that hath offended
him, and maketh a shew as
if he will vtterly cast him off,
determining yet nothing
lesse. So though God the
most louing father to his
children séeme often angry
with vs, as he séemed to bee
with Dauid, it was more in
shew than in déed (which we
may not slightly regard, for

so we may indéed turne his
fatherly displeasure into iust
reuenge) let vs obserue in
wisdome the Lords waies,
how indéed he neuer winketh
long at our least sinne, for
many little sinnes make a
great cry, and when God
heareth their clamour hée
turneth away his face as a
thing loathsome vnto him, as
he did from Dauid for a time,
who féeling it, ranne crying
againe vnto God: O hide
not thy face from me, O Lord
nor cast thy seruant away in
displeasure.
               
               
                  Thou hast beene my succour
(saith Dauid) leaue mee
not, neither forsake mee O
God of my saluation: though

                  Dauid found that God had
hid his face from him, and
séemed displeased with him,
yet he tooke a godly courage
through saith, to put God in
minde of his former fauours
towards him, saying, Thou
hast beene my succour, and
thou changest not, thou art
still the same, and whom
thou hast once chosen, thou
neuer forsakest. He may be
angry with his dearest children
for a time, but he endureth
not long in his displeasure:
but when he with rebukes
doth chastise a man
for his sinne, his beauty consumeth,
and all carnall delights
are as it were irkesome
vnto him in respect of

the losse of Gods fauour.
               Though Dauid séemed
much to bee troubled that
God did hide his face from
him, and to withhold his helping
hand against his enemies,
yet he had hope to redéeme
his fauour againe, because
he was before his succour,
which no doubt hee in
his heart acknowledged, not
to procéed of his owne deseruing,
but of the meere and
frée mercy of God. And therfore
as hee first fréely chose
him without his desert, he
would not cast him off in regard
of his humane frailties,
incident to all men, euen to
ye best men; but would rather
renew, maintaine and confirme

those diuine graces
which it had pleased God before
to plant in him, and so
would returne againe vnto
him in loue, and turne his
face towards him againe, and
not vtterly to leaue him nor
forsake him; and why? because
he was assured, that as
God had promised to be, so
he was, and would be, the
God of his saluation for euer:
for he neuer faileth the performance
of his promises to
a thousand generations. And
his gifts and callings are
without repentance. Therefore
if we be chosen of God,
we cleaue vnto God; if we
cleaue vnto God, God is
faithfull to succour vs, & will

neuer leaue vs nor forsake vs.
               Though he seeme to hide
his face from vs a little, as
he did from Dauid, and to be
displeased with vs as he seemed
to be with him; we may
with like boldnesse build our
assurance of his future helpe,
as Dauid did, by his former
succouring of vs: And as Dauid
held it as an argument
of Gods neuer failing help, in
that hee was ence his succour;
how much more may
such as haue often found him
their defence and succour assure
themselues, that though
he hide his face for a while, he
will neuer faile them nor forsake
them? But that he will
establish his according to his

promise, yt they may yet liue,
& not be disappointed of his
louing fauour again: howsoeuer
they seeme to be forsaken,
Hee that trusteth in the
Lord, mercy shall compasse
him about on euery side.
               
               
                  A Prayer that God will be alwaies
neere vnto vs in our
afflictions, and not to hide his
face and fauour from vs.
                  O Lord, hide not thy face
from me, and cast mee
not away in thy displeasure.
Thou diddest not in the beginning
choose mee for my
worthinesse, O cast me not off

for my weaknesse; thou knewest
before whereof I was
made, and that in me neither
was nor is any goodnesse at
all: and therefore if thou
shouldest hide thy face from
me, I could not iustly accuse
thee of leuity or lightnesse,
soone to loue, and as soone to
reiect; but condemne my
selfe, in that I haue cast away
thy feare, and haue forgotten
and neglected thy due praises
for thy former succour and
goodnesse towards me.
                  I haue runne too farre in the
way of sinne and vanity, by a
lewd law that is in my members,
rebelling against the law
of thy Spirit, incensing thee
to displeasure against mee,

wherein thou seemest to hide
thy face from me, as if thou
hadst neuer knowne me to be
one of thine; yet Lord I know
thee, and doe acknowledge
that thou hast beene my succour,
thou hast beene a gracious
God vnto mee; when I
haue called vpon thee, thou
hast heard mee; when I haue
sought thee, thou hast turned
thy louing countenance towards
me, thou hast not left
me nor forsaken me, therefore
Lord forsake me not for euer,
giue mee not ouer, leaue mee
not vnto my selfe, but keepe
mee vnder the shadow of
thine owne wings, shew me
the light of thy countenance
againe: and as thou hast beene

formerly my succour, leaue me
not now, nor forsake me, O
God of my saluation.
                  If thou turn from me altogether,
I shall altogether perish.
Remember that I am thine,
and the worke of thine owne
hands, destroy me not therefore
ô my God, that which thy
selfe hast made, for there is
none that can plead or maintaine
my cause against thee;
but as sinne hath cast mee
downe, thy grace can raise
mee vp: I haue falne through
frailty, I may rise againe by
faith in thee: I haue lost the
view of thine amiable countenance,
by turning my face
vnto vanity, I may finde it
againe if it please thee to

turne me to thee, and thy face
to me.
                  I haue beene too negligent,
when thou saidst, Seeke
my face, I gaue not such eare
vnto thy words, nor such eye
vnto the beauty of thy face as
I ought. But be thou pleased,
now to be found when I seek
thee; I pray thee heare mee,
now I intreat thee: And cast
mee not away in displeasure,
though I haue displeased
thee. As long as I see thy face
I am safe; but as soone as thou
turnest thy face from me, I am
troubled.
                  When thou leauest me, I
am left without spirituall hope
or helpe, and busie my selfe in
things that profit not: And

therefore I cannot but confesse
indeed, that thou maiest turne
away thy face from me a sinner,
but remember then I became
a sinner, when thou didst
hide thy face from mee: Yet
haue not I forsaken thee, O
God, neither can I goe from
thee wheresoeuer I should couet
to hide my selfe. No, I
will not onely not couer to
hide my selfe, but I come
euen as Dauid to Saul, to discouer
my selfe vnto thee. Alas,
to discouer my selfe, when I
cannot hide my selfe from
thee? Though thou mayst
hide thy face from me, I cannot
hide my waies from
thee. No, Lord, I seeke thee,
let mee finde thee: Leaue

me not, nor forsake mee, O
God of my saluation, nor cast
me thy poorest and meanest
seruant away in thy displeasure:
But as thou hast euer
beene my succour, sustaining
me, releeuing me, defending
me, and comforting me; So
gracious Lord God, in Iesus
Christ, continue my louing
and helping father still. And
then, whatsoeuer, or whosoeuer
shall rise vp against me, I
will neither faint nor feare:
for thou wilt be my succour,
thou wilt neither faile me nor
forsake me, O God of my saluation,
Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 10.
                  Though my Father and my
Mother forsake me, thou
Lord wilt take me vp.
               
               
                  IT is impossible
for man to comprehend
the depth
of Gods vnsearchable
wisdome, prouidence,
and loue towards his
children: his wisdome in disposing,
his prouidence in
finding out, and his loue in
bestowing things, both spirituall
and corporall vpon his
children necessary. In so
much, as wée may admire

with Saint Paul, and say; O
the déepnesse of the vnsearchable
riches, of the wisdome,
prouidence, and loue of God
towards vs, who when father,
mother, friends, and
meanes faile vs, hée taketh
charge of vs; we are all cast
vpon his prouidence and
care, euen as well before, as
when we are borne. And if
then father and mother faile
vs, or forsake vs, he will take
vs to himselfe, as he tooke vp
Moses out of the riuer, being
cast into it in a basket of réeds
in a most desperate danger to
be vtterly cast away. Did father
or mother preserue him?
Was it not the prouidence of
God that saued him? Was

not Ioseph cast into a pit by
his Brethren, intending hée
should haue there perished?
Was hee not after sould to
Merchants, and then as a
slaue, depriued of the aid or
comfort of father, mother, or
friends, falsly accused, vniustly
imprisoned? Who
tooke him into protection?
Who tooke care of him? was
not God alone he that preserued
him?
               The prouidence of God
ouer-ruleth all things that
fall out in the world, for hée
causeth them all to worke for
the best, not onely for them
that are of age to loue him,
and to pray vnto him, as
Dauid did, but euen vnto Infants;

as vnto Moses when
he was a childe, preseruing
him beyond the expectation
of his owne Parents. It
worketh also all troubles,
crosses, and afflictions, to the
good of his. There is none
so young, nor any so old, but
God disposeth of them; yea,
when they haue neither father
nor mother, or friend to
helpe them, hée then comes
and takes them into his own
guard and kéeping, bée they
neuer so base and vile in
mans corrupt indgement; he
can make them honorable, be
they neuer so abiect and despised,
either for birth, or
poore estate, he is all one to
all: he respecteth no degrée.

Though he dwell in the heauens,
farre aboue our apprehension,
yet he beholdeth all
his creatures, and knoweth
them; he can sée through the
Clouds, and behold all the
things on earth: He is good
to all, and his mercies are ouer
all his workes: He vpholdeth
all that fall, and lifteth vp all
that are ready to fall.
               
               When a man loseth father
and mother, being left naked
and destitute of helpe, is it
not a great tentation? When
he knowes not which way, or
to whom to turne for reléefe;
What a comfort is it then,
which the holy spirit hath
here recorded of the prouidence
and loue of God, who

hath promised, that when we
are depriued of all earthly
meanes, he will be a father
and mother vnto vs?
               Children commonly in
their young yeeres, care for
no prouision, for food or maintenance,
but relie onely vpon
their parents: So the Children
of God, howsoeuer old
they are, yet vnable of themselues
to prouide things necessary
without their heauenly
fathers helpe: And
therefore as the young birds

                     •
                  ang at the bill of the old for
food; so doe Gods children
depend vpon God for all that
they néed, and he doth nourish
them. He is in stead of
their naturall father and mother;

nay, fathers and mothers
may haue a good desire
to prouide for their children,
but want the meanes; but
our heauenly father wanteth
none. To come to preferment
(nay to bee supplied
with things necessary) is neither
from the East nor from
the West (saith Dauid) nor
from the South: But God is
the Iudge, he maketh low, and
he maketh high.
               
               What a strange kinde of
care then is it in many Parents,
that setting God (as
it were) aside, his prouidence
and care; and onely study
how they may aduance their
children to greatnesse after
their deaths? As, if when

they can sée them richly prouided
for, it is sufficient; riches,
lands, and reuenues,
are in stead of father and mother,
and of Gods prouidence
also: And yet if these men
were not wilfully blinde, or
rather besotted (whether
more with the fond loue of
their children, or foolish desire
of vaine-glory, I cannot tell)
they might obserue more
(poore) cast, and depending
vpon the prouidence of God,
by religious endeuors to liue
more contentedly with their
little, than many left rich
with their plentie: and more
from meane beginnings to
rise to greatnesse, than in hereditary
greatnesse, to gaine

glory and continuance.
               Let them then that are in
a meane estate, wanting father
and mother, which imply
all worldly meanes, take
comfort and courage in this;
That God to the faithfull is
in stead of al helps; and if our
naturall fathers that begat
vs, our naturall mothers
that bare vs, our friends
that professed friendship to
vs, and the meanes that wée
had to sustaine vs, faile all;
let vs not feare, for the
Lord of heauen and earth,
and the owner and disposer
of all things within the same,
hath giuen vs a promise to be
a father vnto vs; if a father,
he will loue vs; if he loue vs,

he will not see vs want any
thing that is fit and necessary
for vs.
               Though then our eies faile
vs, our féet falter vnder vs,
our hands be helplesse to vs,
though our limbs become
weake; though we hane neither
Gold, nor Siluer, nor
food, nor raiment, nor friend,
nor helper, but our ancient
friends and companions to
deride vs for our basenesse,
enemies to rage and raile against
vs for our poorenesse:
let vs not dismay nor fall
from our faith and assurance
in God; he is our father, let
vs returne vnto him though
as Prodigalls, he will entertaine
vs into his house, not

as seruants but as sonnes.
Hée will regard vs as his
sonnes, prouide for vs as his
sonnes, and defend vs as his
sonnes; and in stead of our
naturall father he will be our
heauenly father, hee will
bring vs vp, and wée shall
want nothing that is good,
though hee séeme here to expose
vs to be as Apprentises
for a time in the world, to
learne to beare the Crosse of
Christ; it is but seuen
yéeres, be it seuenty, hee in
the end will make vs frée
men of the City, new Ierusalem,
where we shall worke
no more in our former trade
of life, but in stead of all the
miseries and troubles wée

here endure, wee shall haue
peace, and rest, and glory for
euermore.
               Therefore in the meane
time, while we shall liue as
the worlds slaues here, let vs
vndergoe it with patience, it
is but a little while: If we
want any thing for soule or
body, hee willeth vs to tell
him and hee will supply it;
If any wrong vs or abuse
vs, to complaine to him and
he will redresse it. If we bée
sicke, he knoweth our diseases;
he is our Physician, and
knoweth whether life or
death be fittest for vs. If we
die, he will restore vs to life
eternall, therefore may wée
fréely cast our care vpon him,

for hee careth for vs.
               
                  Fathers (saith Salomon)
are the glory of their children.
How much more shall the
God of all glory, our heauenly
Father, be a glory to vs
his children? who hath prouided
for vs an inheritance,
which no man can depriue vs
of, yea a Kingdome whose
glory shall haue no end. The
remembrance of our futur
                     •
                  
enioying it, is as a most deepe
Sea of comfort in this inferiour
Kingdome of crosses.
It cannot bee fadomed with
the line of mans capacity;
what hee hath promised hee
will performe for his children,
therefore may we stand
assured and boldly affirme,

that though the fathers and
mothers of the faithfull doe
forsake them, that God will
take charge of them.
               
                  A Prayer that God will shew
himselfe our father in all our
troubles and afflictions when
all other helpe faileth.
                  O Gracious Lord God,
most mercifull and louing
Father, from whom proceedeth
euery good and perfect
gift, and who of thine
owne will hast begotten vs
with the Word of truth; shew
thy selfe a father vnto mee
who am depriued of father

and mother, from all helpe
and comfort in this life, beset
on all sides with troubles,
dangers and many afflictions,
relying only vpon thy prouidence;
shew thy selfe vnto me
a father, a powerfull and protecting
father, as thou diddest
vnto Ioseph, who being depriued
of father and mother, hated
of his brethren, sold as a
slaue, falsly accused, sharply
imprisoned, hauing none to
helpe him or to comfort him,
forsaken of all his friends; yet
when all helpe failed, thou
tookest him into thy protection,
and directedst him in thy
waies, he became louing vnto
thee as a sonne, obedient vnto
thee as a seruant, he waited on

thee as vpon a most faithfull
father, hee called vpon thee
and thou heardest him, and
gauest him the honour of a
sonne, euen in this life holinesse
and honour; testifying
vnto him that thou his father
hadst a respect vnto his faith,
constancy and wrongs, neuer
leauing him nor forsaking
him; to teach vs, O Lord, faithfully
to depend vpon thy mercy,
power and prouidence, in
whatsoeuer danger.
                  I was left vnto thee as soone
as I was borne, and thou like
a most louing father tookest
me vp & hast hitherunto kept
me: O forsake mee not, for
if thou my father leaue me and
forsake mee, who will or can

take charge of me? I am many
waies afflicted and full of
sorrow, not so much for my
troubles as for that I haue sinned
and offended thee so louing
a God as thou Hast beene
vnto me euer vnto this day:
but now louing Father, I
seeme destitute of thy fauour,
of thy releeuing hand, I am
he 
                        •
                     ily oppressed, and what I
endure is not hid from thee,
and thou onely knowest how
to releeue me; my father, my
mother, and all my friends
haue forsaken me. Dauid being
thus destitute, he resorted
vnto thee, confessing that
when his father and his mother
forsooke him, thou tookest
him vp; and is thyr fatherly

affection dead and discontinued
in Dauid? No, no, louing
art thou still, powerfull
art thou still, and helpfull art
thou still, for thy faithfulnesse,
and thy truth, and thy power,
and thy prouidence are for
euer: and happy, yea most
happy is he that hath thee his
releeuing and helping father;
for nothing is wanting to him
that is thus cast vpon thee:
He hath not only the promise
but the assurance of thy presence
and loue both in this
life and the life to come.
                  Yet gracious Father, among
all men it goeth hardest with
thine owne children, often
troubled, much abused, deeply
distressed, falsly accused,

scoffingly derided, and many
crosses, cruell calamities, and
great afflictions follow them;
& I am enforced to vndergoe
the burthen of infinite trialls,
as if thou hadst not onely not
taken mee vp, but vtterly
cast mee off: And were it not
that I truly know thee to bee
my father, in that thou so fatherly,
yet sharply correctest
me, I could not but faint: but
thy grace sustaineth mee, and
doth inwardly comfort mee,
else should I vtterly despaire.
                  O my father, take mee into
thy protection, leaue me not,
forsake mee not, for I am
brought very low, and there
is none that careth for mee,
there is none willing to adde

any comfort but sorrow vnto
my soule; there is neither father
nor mother, neither
friend nor helper to commiserate
mine estate, but thou
whom I only trust, for thy promises
tend to mine encouragement,
to cast my care vpon
thee, who hast willed all that
are oppressed to come to thee
and be eased: But Lord what
booteth it mee to seeke thee
when I cannot finde thee?
to pray vnto thee when thou
seemest to refuse to heare me?
Haue I so deepely offended
thee, that neither my repentance
can pacifie thee? the
mediation of thy Sonne reconcile
thee? nor my faithfull
prayers preuaile with

thee? Is thy mercy come to
an end? Hast thou no more
blessings for thy children?
                  O wretch that I am, Why
doe I thus reason with thee?
am I able to ouer-rule thee
with my words? Shall I teach
thee what thou shouldest doe?
No Lord, I only bewray mine
ignorance by my words;
which can no further preuaile
with thee, than thou in thy
wisdome and mercy thinkest
fit for mee. Therefore will I
close my lips, I will keepe silence,
and wait both thy pleasure
and leisure, for thou hast
a time to be angry, and a time
to hee pacified. I will rest
with patience, and commit
my selfe vnto thee in obedience,

and if thou lay a greater
burthen vpon mee then yet I
beare, if thou suffer mee to
sinke and to bee cleane ouerwhelmed
with more bitter
waters than yet I feele, I will
yet trust in thee though my
body perish, and all outward
helpe faile mee, preserue my
soule O Lord, for thou art the
father of it, and respectest it
farre aboue my carnall par
                        ••
                     ;
yet both make but one body,
yet may the one prosper when
the other may perish. But I
know that such is thy care of
both, that rather than thou
wilt permit me vtterly to bee
confounded, thou wilt euen
send from Heauen and saue
me. Be it vnto me euen as thou

wilt, O God, my strength and
my saluation.
               
            
            
               
                  VERSE 11.
                  Teach mee thy way, O Lord,
and lead me in a right path,
because of mine enemies.
               
               
                  IT is the property
of an enemy
to bée alwaies
prying into the
life of him hee
hates, and to obserue whatsoeuer
faults hée doth commit
(though he himselfe bée
quilty of more) and to publish
and proclaime them to
the world to his vttermost

disgrace. And therefore it behooueth
all men, especially a
man that hath enemies (as
Dauid had) to looke vnto his
waies, lest by the errors of
his life they take aduantage,
and so make his cause (otherwise
good) séeme the worst,
though his errors no way
concerne the matter in controuersie
betwéene them, but
méerely his frailty; falling as
a naturall man, whereof
Dauid being afraid, he prayeth
vnto God that he would
teach him his way which is
vncorrupt, and to leade him
in an vpright path; not onely
in his ordinary calling, but
in the sincerity of his religion
and profession, lest his

enemies that are alwaies
watchfull should haue cause
to accuse him of some grosse
sinne, and so draw him into
the censure and condemnation
of the world.
               
                  Dauid was a man chosen of
God, but by nature apt and
inclined to sinne like other
men, who all haue their peculiar
faults: No man liueth
so sincerely, but if his life
in all points, at all times,
be narrowly obserued and examined
by his owne conscience,
he may be taxed or tax
himselfe, either for committing
things which God hath
forbidden, or omitting things
which God hath commanded:
And therefore as Dauid
                  
here prayeth God to teach
him his way, and to lead him
in a right path, and as Moses
before him prayed vnto God
saying, If I haue found fauour
in thy sight, shew me now thy
way, that I may know thee,
and that I may finde grace in
thy sight; So ought euery
Christian to pray that God
would not onely teach him
but lead him also, not onely
because of his enemies whose
slanders hée feareth (which
yet is necessary) but because
God should not be dishonoured
by his corrupt conuersation
and sinne.
               There is no man, especially
Gods children, but haue
enemies, not onely corporall

but spirituall, among whom
the subtillest and strongest is
Satan, who looketh not so
much into what a man doth,
as into the inclination of his
heart by the things hee doth:
for by his workes he findeth
what is in man (for thoughts
are hid) and by his outward
actions he can collect whereunto
hée is inclined: and vpon
that he workes and laies
his plots accordingly, and
most commonly he obserueth
in euery man some sinne that
raigneth and ruleth aboue all
other sinnes, which he hugs
(as it were) in his bosome:
there doth Satan apply his
greatest battery, knowing
that if he vanquish him in it,

and sée him to continue in it,
it is as much as if he had inticed
him to a thousand sins,
and therefore hee laieth baits
(according to a cunning
Fowler or Fisherman, that
hath one especiall bait for
each kinde of Fowle or Fish)
according to the desire of that
peculiar sin wherein a man
most delighteth, entertaining
euery occasion or fit opportunity
to féed his desire,
which Satan finding, vseth
his instruments to féed him
with varieties.
               Euery raigning or rather
raging sinne in man, may be
compared to the disease in
mans body called the Wolfe,
which if it be not continually

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
fed with some kinde of satisfactory
matter, will soone deuoure
the very flesh of yt part
of the body wherupon it hath
seized; so that sinne that a
man holdeth so deare (to
which hee cannot but yeeld
vpon euery opportunity afforded)
must be fed with the
satisfying of those corrupt
desires which best agree
with the nature of that
woluish disease, otherwise
it will euen eat vp their senses,
and they will become
as mad men when they are
restrained from what that
sinne desireth: As for example,
take game from the couetous
man hee will become
euen cut of his wits; barre

the drunkard of his liquor,
and he will rage like a shéebeare
robbed of her whelps;
preuent the lasciuious man
of his Harlots, he will swagger,
sweare, and aduenture
his life to haue them: and
so of the rest.
               If therefore a man fall into
any of these dominant
sinnes, and liue in it, what
an aduantage is it vnto his
enemies? It is a double aduantage;
first, it makes him
scandalous in the world,
whose good opinion with the
vertuous and religious hée
loseth; It offends GOD,
whose hand is alwaies ouer
the righteous to defend them,
& against the wicked to confound
them.
               
                  
How sottish then are these
men that will giue entertainment
at the first to such seruants,
as at last shall become
their masters? Sinne in the
beginning is weake, and
with ease may be subdued,
but when it hath beene cherished
and nursed vp awhile in
our brests, as beloued, and
fed, as it will require, it beconuneth
predominant, facing
as it were a man, and as
if it should say, I haue thus
long ouerruled thée, I will
yet make thée my slaue. O
fearefull estate, yet not a few
liue in this miserable seruility;
and doth not that enemy
Satan triumph to obserue
his vassals thus subiected?

and doth he not stirre vp enemies
to vpbraid them? some
to mocke and scorne them?
some to reproach and reuile
them? and finally, doth hee
not laugh at their destruction?
               Had not holy Dauid thē good
cause to be afraid to be thus
carried away with the violence
of his owne corrupt nature,
which no doubt hée felt
something inclinable rather
to goe astray, than to goe on ye
way the Lord taught him? &
had he not good cause (as eueryman
hath) instantly to pray
vnto God, Teach me thy way
O Lord, and leade me in thy
right path, because of mine
enemies? Where it appeareth

that it is not enough to
know the way of God vnlesse
wee walke in it, and what
power haue we of our selues
to walke aright vnlesse the
spirit of God leade vs? we
may thinke wee are right
when wee are cleane out of
the way, as many deceiued
silly soules doe▪ that thinke
themselues right, and others
out of the way, when indéed
they walke in darknesse and
haue no light at all.
               Enemies are alwaies enuious
against the prosperity
& good that the godly receiue,
and reioyce when any disgrace,
misery, or misfortune
befalls them: When my foot
slipt (saith Dauid) mine enemies

reioyced. So doth Satan
and his instruments,
who neuer rest day nor night,
seeking to draw (if it were
possible) Gods owne children
into the waies of the
wicked, and then againe to
moue and instigate the wicked
to reproach vs for our
sinnes, so that wée must not
looke to liue here securely,
euen in our séeming most
quiet estate; for when wée
thinke of none, and deserue
least disgrace, Satan will
raise vp one railing and reuiling
Shemei, some one traiterous
Iudas, or one trecherous
Achithophel or another to
trouble vs. And if wee haue
committed any knowne sin,

be it neuer so small, whether
in our place, conuersation or
profession, wee shall be sure
to heare it. Let vs liue neuer
so warily, neuer so ciuily, neuer
so sincerely, we haue enemies
enow to espy out our
secretest actions, to heare our
most priuate speech: for in
the most godly little sinnes
seeme great, and are soone discouered;
and great sinnes in
the wicked séeme no sinnes,
therefore haue the wicked
few enemies whom they
feare to sée their waies, but
the godly many. It is no disgrace
to a wicked man to bée
wicked, it is his profession:
as it is no blemish to the
beauty of an Aethiopian to be

blacke, it is his naturall colour;
and therefore as long
as none but wicked men
scandalize vs and condemne
vs, we néed not be ashamed;
no, though they raile, reuile
and curse vs, wee néed not
feare it, for in stead of their
curses God will blesse vs:
yet let vs pray, Teach me, O
Lord, thy way, and leade me
in thy path aright because of
mine enemies.
               
               None but enuious and
wicked men are malicous enemies
vnto such as feare
God, and they indéed cannot
sléepe vntill they haue contriued
some mischiefe against
the innocent whom they
would disgrace, taking all

occasions and aduantages to
worke them any violence;
though they be already afflicted,
they will afflict them
more; if they bee already fallen,
they will euen tread vpon
them to kéepe them downe
that they may not rise. It is
their glory if they can adde
more sorrow to the sorrowfull,
and more griefe to the
grieued; they are continually
trauelling with wickednes,
conceiuing mischiefe, but
they commonly bring forth a
lie; for the mischiefe yt they
intend to others fals in the
end vpon their owne heads,
and their cruelty vpon their
owne pates: they are snared
euen with the works of their

owne hands, for God hath
euer, he doth, and euer will
preserue his owne from these
wicked men; though he suffer
them somtimes bodily to
perish vnder their tyranny, it
is but to aggrauate the sins
of their persecutors, and the
sooner to bring his vnto their
finall glory. Therefore behoueth
the most godly to bée
wary of their waies; for how
much the more godly, religious
and zealous they are in
walking with God, so much
the more malicious is Satan
to raise vp troubles, slanders
and reproaches against
them, by such as he can stir
vp against vs; who howsoeuer
inwardly enuious they

are, yet haue they learned of
their master to speake plausibly,
though deceitfully, flattering
with their lips, hauing
a venomous heart within,
whereby they oftentimes
allure the innocent without
suspicion to bewray vnto
them their secret thoughts
and intentions: and in simplicity
(by their inchanted
subtilties) discouer that
which these wicked serpentine
wretches worke vpon,
and wrest to bring, not only
their names, reputation and
credit, but their estates and
liues in question. By their
wicked counsell they compasse
our steps, they set their
enuious eyes vpon our

waies: If they finde wée
walke vnblameable, they wil
plot to haue some blockes to
be laid in our waies, that if
it be possible we might stumble,
though they could not
make vs fall altogether: If
we erre (on the other side)
neuer so little, they will insult
ouer vs, they will blow
the trumpet of our defamation
and cry, There, there, so
would we haut it. But these
deuices of theirs God séeth,
and what they practise against
such as feare him: therfore
let vs only say, Teach vs,
O Lord, thy way, and leade vs
in the right path because of
our enemies.
               
               As long as wee walke in

the way of God truly, and be
lead that path that is right,
let vs not feare. Heare what
Dauid said vnto Salomon his
sonne, whom he exhorted to
walke in the waies of the
Lord, to keepe his Statutes
and his Commandementes, his
Iudgements and his Testimonies.
We must endeuour to
haue Gods lawes euer before
our eies, and neuer depart
from his precepts: This
is the way, walke in it.
Though it bee a strict way
and vnpleasant to a carnall
minde; it is a most swéet and
comfortable way, a way that
leadeth here to happinesse,
and after to Heauen.
               There is another way, a

common high way, much
beaten by diuers passengers,
all carnall men traffike this
way, a very pleasant way,
wherein yet many haue walked
for a time, but they haue
found that as a man that eateth
too much hony, may surfet
through the swéetnesse of
it, so they were euen glutted
with the vanities that are
strewed in the way. It is a
way full of carnall content
indeed, but it is but short;
men are at their waies end
many times when they think
themselues not halfe way
there, and are grieued their
iourney is so soone done. But
when they come to the end of
the race, they suddenly finde

a most fearefull gulph which
they cannot auoid; turne
backe againe they cannot as
ordinary trauellers often doe
when they haue mistaken
their way and take another;
but they that walke this high
and pleasant way must bée
enforced to stay, and to take
vp their hideous Inne, not
for a night as waifaring men
doe, but remaine there for
euer with the Deuill and his
Angels.
               
                  
                  A Prayer that God will be pleased
to direct vs in his waies,
and leade vs vprightly because
of our enemies.
                  O Gracious Lord God,
most mercifull and louing
father in Iesus Christ,
vouchsafe to looke in mercy
vpon me, teach mee thy way
O Lord, and lead me in a right
path because of mine enemies.
Giue mee grace that I may
walke aright, and pray aright,
and beleeue aright, and in all
mine actiōs be guided by thee
aright. Reframe me from the
way of the wicked, and guide

me in the paths of righteousnesse,
make thy way plaine
before my face: for of my selfe
I am blinde, I cannot see the
right way, direct and guide
me that I stumble not, to cause
mine enemies to laugh and reioyce
at my fall. Send out thy
light and thy truth, let them
leade me and bring mee to
thine holy mountaine, where
I shall be safe from mine enemies;
order and direct my
goings, O Lord, aright according
to thy word; reclaime
me from euery euill way, and
direct my feet in the way of
truth, in that way that leadeth
to life; preuent mee of that
forbidden way which is pleasant
yet perillous; seeming

plaine and delectable, but the
end thereof is death: Lord let
my walkings bee vpright because
of mine enemies, who
watch euen the course of my
life, they pry into all mine
actions, they obserue my conuersation,
and if they see mee
but slide or slip neuer so little
awry, they sound the trumpets
of my disgrace: If they
see mee to fall into any sinne
through my frailty, they cry
out and say, That there is no
feare of thee before mine eies.
                  O my God, consider this,
and in mercy remember I am
but dust, by nature subiect to
great infirmities, which I doe
acknowledge, O Lord; reclaime
mee from my euill inclination

by thy grace, set me
in the way of truth and obedience,
and leade me therein for
euer, and learne mee to liue
after thy Commandements,
and yeeld mee thy feare and
thy direction that I may walk
in them, for mine owne waies
are (as my will is) by nature
euill euermore: but thy waies
are mercy and truth, and such
as truly feare thy name thou
teachest the waies of perfect
obedience, and reducest euen
sinners to walke aright, reclaiming
them by thy grace from
their euill waies.
                  Guide me that I may know
thee and thy waies, and leade
me aright in them: let me neuer
goe astray from them, lest

mine enemies take occasion
by my transgressions, to say
that I haue no feare of thee before
mine eies: deliuer me out
of their hands O Lord, out of
the hands of euill and cruell
men, and from their slanderous
and false tongues that are
set on fire against the innocent.
They hate them that
offend them not, they persecute
them that resist them
not; let them haue no iust
cause to condemne my waies.
                  Thou hast set before vs a
blessing and a curse; a blessing
for them that walke vprightly
in thy waies; and a curse to
them that wilfully fotsake the
way which thou hast appointed
thy children to walke in.

O shew mee the good and
right way, and euermore leade
me therein: Giue me grace to
take heed of that way which
seemeth right, the end whereof
is death: Draw me, O Lord,
out of this way, and leade me
by thy right hand, so shall I abandon
this way, full of carnall
pleasures and sinfull delights:
Teach me thy waies,
the waies of obedience and repentance,
the waies of righteousnesse
and peace, which
tend to eternall life. It is not
in my power or wisdome to
finde out, or walke in this
way: It is hid from humane
vnderstanding; and therefore
euen Moses, though otherwise
of deepe knowledge, being

by nature ignorant of this
way, sought to be and was instructed
by thee therein. How
much more, good Father, need
I to intreat thee to learne me
this way; for I haue beene
long lead awry be mine owne
corrupt affections, not knowing
the way of truth and
righteousnesse: wherein I beseech
thee to guide and leade
mee now at the last and for
euer, because of mine enemies,
O Lord, my God, my guide,
and my Redeemer, Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 12.
                  Giue me not ouer to the lust
of mine enemies, for there
are false witnesses risen vp
against mee, and such as
speake cruelly.
               
               
                  WHat man is he
that liueth, &
is frée from
enemies? Of
what estate,
condition, or
quality soeuer? If he be good,
the wicked will hate him, the
world will disfauour him,
and the Deuill will maligne
him. If he be euill, the vertuous

will dislike him, the
godly cannot affect him, God
cannot blesse him: yet ought
euery man to endeuour to be
godly, howsoeuer Satan will
doe what he can to raise enemies
against him, as he did
against godly Dauid, and against
all the holy men of
God from the beginning; as
first against Abel, against
Iob, and aboue all, against
Christ himselfe; whose enemies
séemed to haue their
full lust fulfilled against him,
neuer leauing him vntill they
had crucified him: And yet
then were they néerest to
their owne confusion when
they had their wils of him.
               
                  Dauid in this Psalme séemeth

to haue béene much
troubled with enemies, and
yet sheweth in the second
verse of the same, that when
his enemies and his foes came
vpon him to eat vp his flesh,
they stumbled and fell. In
the third verse, hee sheweth
such faith and confidence
in God, that though an Host
pitched against him, his heart
should not be afraid: Yet in
this twelfth verse, he séemeth
to feare againe, lest his enemies
might yet preuaile against
him; and therefore
praieth, that God would not
giue him ouer to the lust of
his enemies; which may teach▪
vs, that when we thinke our
selues most frée from, and

(as it were) out of the reach
of all enemies, not to be secure:
for a reconciled enemy
may harbour secret mischiefe,
which although hée
will not for his counterfeit
promise sake, execute by his
owne publike violence; yet
he may suborne such secretly,
as may renew either the
open quarrell againe, or falsly
accuse the innocent party.
And this as it séemeth did
Dauid finde: for when hée
thought all his enemies were
at peace with him, he obserued
some secret practises
against him, By false witnesses
which were risen against
him, who accused him afresh,
and procured him new,

or moued his old Aduersaries
against him, which séemeth
to afright him more,
than before an Host of enemies
could doe. For now hée
praieth, that God would not
giue him ouer to the lust of
them that before he feared
not; which sheweth, that a
second danger is more fearefull
than a former: And
which also sheweth our too
much securitie, after our deliuery
from a danger, as
though we néed no more to
feare another to follow: But
if we obserue well the course
of the waies of wicked men,
we shal see, that they seldome
giue ouer to prosecute them
they once desired to persecute.

And God hath likewise
such an eie vnto his owne
children, that he will not haue
them idle; hee will exercise
them as long as they liue
heere; they must bee partakers
of his crosses; they
must haue enemies as hee
had, they must suffer pouertie,
ignominy and disgrace
in the world as hee did:
Though he being Lord of all,
and could command all; hée
was poore, yet all the world,
and the things in the world
were his; when he was hungry,
he could haue plentifully
supplied his hunger; being
disgraced by the reproba
                     •
                  e
Jewes, he could haue done as
Peter did with Annanias and

                  Saphira, haue spoken but the
word, and his enemies
should haue fallen dead at his
foot. But he patiently suffered
all, to teach vs that are
but seruants, to imitate him
that is our master and Lord.
If they called him. Belsabub,
and he suffered them, why
should we take scorne to bée
despised, reproached, and ill
intreated, and our enemies
to insult ouer vs, and to haue
their lust fulfilled against vs,
euen to take away our liues?
We are but seruants, hée
was our Lord, yet he endured;
and shall we thinke our
selues better, or deserue to
be more frée than he, that
was guiltie of no offence against

them that thus abused
him? We being culpable of a
thousand sinnes against him,
and yet hath fréed vs from
the guilt and punishment of
all? Yet it behooueth vs to
pray as Dauid did: Giue mee
not ouer vnto the lust of mine
Aduersaries; For as there
were against Christ, so there
are false Witnesses risen vp
against vs, and such also as
speake cruelly: Cruell and
wicked men haue commonly
attending them, such as will
speake and practise what they
will haue them for gaine: if
they will haue them to accuse
any man falsly, they can coine
matter; This man said, If
they did destroy the Temple

of Ierusalem which was made
with hands, he would build
it in three daies without
hands. Whereas indéed hée
said, that if they did destroy
the Temple of his body, hee
would raise it againe in three
daies, as he did. But by this
may be obserued the cunning
and subtilty of the Deuill,
that can and doth prompt his
wicked Instruments, how
they may peruert the words
and actions of the innocent,
to a sense cleane contrary to
their meaning, and make so
false a Glosse vpon it, as if it
were truth it selfe; and will
set such an audacious face
vpon it, as (if God deale not
with the falsly accused, as hée

did for the defence of innocent
Susanna) they will haue
their lust of them. Such a
false witnesse was perfidious
Ziba against Mephibosheth,
the sonne of Ionathan,
Sauls sonne, who accused him
most falsly to Dauid, perswading
him that Mephibosheth
went about to take from Dauid
the kingdome, onely to
get Mephibosheths patrimony:
as it is commonly the
end of all the testimonies
false witnesses giue, to gaine
outward reward thereby.
As the Iewes hired and suborned
false witnesses against
that most sanctified man Stephen,
to put him to death.
The like against innocent

                  Naboth by wicked Iezabel,
who was likewise stoned, to
fulfill the lust of enemies.
               It is a dangerous thing,
for the most innocent man in
the world, to fall vnder the
testimony of false witnesses.
The accused seldome escapes,
vnlesse there be a Daniel
to examine circumstances
to finde out the truth. A
false witnesse is one of the six
things that God himselfe abhorreth:
for of all men he is
the most dangerous; and
therefore no maruell, that
Dauid hauing such enemies
as made no conscience of
whatsoeuer deuillish inuention
to betray him, and to
haue their lust of him, did

pray, Giue me not ouer to the
lust of mine enemies; for
there are false witnesses risen
vp against mee, and such as
speake cruelly.
               
               
                  Dauid feared more false
witnesses than the open force
of his enemies; who when
they came vpon him they
stumbled and fell; and therefore
was not dismaied if an
Host pitched against him. Secret
false combinations of
enemies accompanied with
false witnesses, who can
withstand, or auoid?
               The tongue which God
made in the beginning good,
and to be a faithfull witnesse
of the heart, the Deuill hath
made the instrument of falshood

and lies: For now in
many, the heart & the tongue
are so estranged, as the one
vttereth what ye other thinks
not, & the other thinks what ye
other vtters not. The tongue
becomes an instrument to deceiue,
which was made to explaine
the true meaning of
the heart: But where the
tongue speakes falsly, the
heart cannot be right; and
where the heart is corrupt,
the tongue cannot be sound.
               There was once a confusion
of tongues; not of that
part which moueth to frame
the voice, for the tongue
it selfe remained as before it
was; but inforced to alter
the language: but now there

séemeth to be a confusion betwéene
the tongue and the
heart, which should be as
one: Both which being so
farre disioyned in consent
now, as it séemeth to be another
confusion of our language.
One knew not what
another said, when that one
language became so changed;
and who vnderstands now
what another speakes, when
he speakes what he meanes
not? How then can hee bee
truly vnderstood what hée
speakes? Men indéed are become
(as it were) false witnesses
against themselues,
when the tongue beares witnesse
against the heart, and
the heart against the tongue.

If then we become so confounded
in our language,
when we call for one thing,
we bee offered another; all
good men had néed to craue a
diuine Interpreter, who
knoweth the heart; for by the
tongue we cannot truly vnderstand
what some men
meane. And that is the reason
so many are at this day
deceiued, and vniustly many
times condemned; and therefore
not vnfit for euery man,
though he obserue to haue no
professed enemy, as Dauid
seemed to haue, to pray, as
Dauid did vnto God, the
searcher and disposer of all
hearts, and she restrainer of
all false tongues, O giue me

not ouer to the lust of mine
enemies, for there are false witnesses
risen vp against mee,
and such as speake cruelly.
               
               
                  A Prayer, that God will preserue
vs from our enemies,
that they preuaile not against
vs, and to preuent vs of false
witnesses.
                  O Most mighty God, Defender
of the faithfull,
the Protector of them that
betake themselues vnder thy
protecting hand; the mightiest
among men cannot hurt
the least whom thou protectest;
the subtillest cannot
circumuent them, whom thou

guidest in thine owne waies.
Saul could not hurt Dauid,
though he pursued him with
deadly hatred, pursuing him
to take away his life: Thou
neuer leftest him to the lust of
his enemies: Thou art powerfull,
and in respect of thee, my
most powerfull and politickest
Aduersaries are weake and
foolish. O let them not haue
their wished desires against
me; though they suborne false
witnesses against me, let their
false tongues falter in their
mouthes: Let their lying lips
be shut vp with shame; and let
all those that take malicious
counsell against me, and combine
together to hurt or to destroy
me, be turned enemies

one to the other, and let them
doe each to other as they intend
to doe vnto me. Let their
tongues wherewith they
thinke to speake falsly against
me, cleaue to the roofes of
their mouthes.
                  For thou hearest how
proudly, hatefully, and disdainfully
they speake against
me falsly, as if I were their enemy:
But thou art a righteous
Iudge, and markest theirs
and my waies, their thoughts,
and their practises and policies,
and my simplicitie: None
of their inward inuentions,
none of their wicked proiects,
policies, and secret practises
are hid from thee; and
therefore (Lord) leaue me not

vnto their lust. Confirme my
faith in thee; powre thy grace
and holy spirit into the inward
parts of my soule, that I
sincerely seruing thee, may
either win their vnfained
friendship, or that thou wilt
preuent their malicious deuices
against me, and that I may
possesse mine owne in peace.
Although they now stand vpon
the open stage of the world,
and sound out the Trumpets
of their enuious and slanderous
tongues of reproach against
me; And although they
suborne false witnesses against
me; let my vprightnesse approue
them lyers: Let my
course of life so contrary to
their false reports, try and approue

proue them false witnesses
risen vp against me. Though
I cannot but confesse against
my selfe, not onely vnto thee
in secret, but vnto them openly,
that I come short of some
duties that I ought to performe,
yet consider my willing
minde to performe them
without reproofe.
                  Lord, I am weake in
strength, I am not wise enough
to deale with the Politicians
of this world, I cannot
withstand nor finde out the
practises that mine enemies
contriue against mee, who
haue a strong desire to haue
their wills & to execute their
lust, especially false witnesses
being suborned against mee:

but giue me not ouer to the lust
of mine aduersaries that speake
so cruelly against me, falsifying
the cause of their hatred as
if I had done them iniury,
extenuating their owne malice
and mischiefe, as if their
wicked deuices were lawfull
and grounded vpon Iustice,
and their violence rather
charitable than malicious:
what they haue done, and
what they intend thou knowest,
and how vniustly they afflict
me thou seest, who art a
God that iudgest right.
                  Rise vp therefore, O Lord,
and take my cause into thine
owne hand, make their wicked
counsells as Achithophels;
for haue they not said in

their hearts, Come let vs cut
them off from being a people,
and let their name bee no more
had in remembrance? In so
much as many of them say,
There is no helpe for me in thee:
Yet Lord I dismay not, for
thou art my defence, and in
thine appointed time wilt lift
vp my head againe; for saluation
belongeth vnto thee, O
God, and thou wilt destroy
the bloudy and deceitful men.
But blessed and preserued shall
they bee that truly feare and
trust in thee, thy power is
seene in weaknesse, and thy
helpe in affliction: therefore
O Lord, let not mine enemies
haue their lust of me.
                  I know thou wilt performe

thy promise of my defence in
thy good time, therefore will
I rest in hope, I will patiently
wait for yet a little while, and
these wicked men shall not appeare.
In the meane time I
will commit my cause vnto
thee my Lord, my God,
my strength and my Redeemer.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 13.
                  I should haue fainted except I
had beleeued to see the
goodnesse of thee in the
land of the liuing.
               
               
                  ENemies troubles
and afflictions
are heauy to bee
borne of such as
are weake in
faith, and haue not perfect
patience to beare them, as
may appeare by godly Dauid
himselfe; who acknowledgeth
that himselfe, though he
were a man chosen after
Gods owne heart, should

haue fainted vnder the malice
and fury of his enemies
and other afflictions, but yt
he beléeued to sée the goodnes
of God, namely his timely
deliuery in the land of the liuing,
euen here before the
sonnes of men, where if hée
had not found the goodnesse of
God towards him, all men
would haue thought as his
enemies did, that God had
vtterly forsaken him for euer:
and therfore prayed God
in a liuely faith that his defence
might here appeare before
he were taken hence, no
more to be séene, although he
knew that after this life hée
should bee in a farre more
happy and blessed estate than

his enemies, but that hee
might finde Gods fauour
here, to the end that other
godly afflicted men, séeing
the mercies of God towards
him in deliuering him out of
his troubles, might by his
faith and patience take like
godly resolution to depend
vpon the power and prouidence
of God for their like
deliuery.
               
                  Why art thou cast downe
O my soule (saith Dauid in
his troubles) and so vnquiet
within mee? which argueth,
that troubles and afflictions
euen to a faithfull man doe
at the first much disquiet his
heart, like as they that first
are committed to prison,

they are much disquieted,
their hearts faint and are
much cast downe, vntill they
haue béene for a time enured
to their restraint, and then
come by little and little to
themselues againe; so doe
they that vpon a sudden fall
into any affliction as Dauid
did, but hauing a little considered
that it is the Lords doing,
hee could then say vnto
his sad soule, Wait on God,
for I will yet giue him thanks
for the helpe of his presence.
This sheweth the strong
faith and confidence of Dauid,
who although his troubles
were so many and heauy,
euen at the present, that
he was ready to faint vnder

them, yet hee waited with a
firme assurance, that the time
would come wherein hee
should reioyce againe and
praise God againe for his
helpe and certaine deliuery
which hee knew was not
farre off.
               This teacheth euery faithfull
man in his afflictions
and troubles to repaire vnto
God in prayer, not to bée
daunted or dismaid, nor to
disquiet himselfe, but in patience
to possesse his soule,
waiting the time wherein
God hath appointed to deliuer
him, for it is a vaine
thing and vnprofitable for a
man in affliction to goe before
the Lords prouidence;

strugling and striuing by sinister
and vncommanded
meanes to frée himselfe: he
doth by that meanes the
more intangle himselfe as the
Bird in the Net: warranted
meanes hee may vse, and
those with faithfull prayer
vnto GOD to blesse the
meanes, for lawfull meanes
profit not, vnlesse they be also
lawfully done, and that is
when and where God is
made, not onely a party, but
the principall in the meanes.
It was a very weake weapon
that Dauid vsed against
Goliah, who was compleatly
armed from the foot to the
head, there was but one
small part of his whole body

vnarmed, and that was the
fore part of his head, but
God so directed the stone that
came out of his sling, that it
found that open way to cast
that monster of men to the
earth. If God had not added
strength to Dauids armes,
and by his prouidence carried
the stone aright, Dauids
aime might haue failed the
marke; so whatsoeuer means
we vse, either in preuenting
or easing our selues in
any kinde of affliction, if our
hearts be not seasoned with
faith in God, ioined with praier,
we may misse of our hope,
and so faint in the expectation
of our deliuery; and therefore
saith Dauid, I should haue

fainted except I had beleeued
to see the goodnesse of the
Lord. Except I had depended
on his prouidence for my
deliuery from mine enemies,
and had taken hold and beene
assured of the true performance
of his promises to
ease me of mine afflictions,
I should haue sunke vnder
the burthen of my troubles.
God who is our Father is
goodnesse it selfe, of whom
and from whom wee obtaine
all things through faith in
his Sonne: by him we liue,
moue and haue our being;
and therefore there is none,
in whom or by whom wée
should séeke helpe in troubles,
but in God alone. He is

our hope and strength, and
helpe in troubles ready to bee
found: Therefore (saith Dauid)
I will neither faint nor
feare: and againe, my defence
is in God, who preserueth the
vpright in heart. He is God,
and none besides; he is mighty,
and none else; Why then
should we faint in any troubles?
Why should wee bee
daunted, though enemies rise
vp against vs? Séeing this
God is our God, whose goodnesse,
helpe and deliuery (if
we beléeue) we shall sée, and
our very enemies shall sée it
euen here, here in this vale of
misery amongst the sons of
men, he shall be our guide and
defence vnto death.
               
                  
Unbeléefe is a most dangerous
disease in the heart of
man, nothing succeedeth comfortably
vnto them that beléeue
not in God: good things
vnto vnbeléeuers turne to
euill. As vnto a raw, crude, &
a stomack ouercome with superfluous
humors, the best
meat turnes to increase their
disease; so to an vnfaithfull
man all things worke together
to the increase of Gods
iudgements against him. As
to the sonnes in law of Lot in
Sodome, who would not beléeue
the Word of God declared
by Lot, for the confusion
of the City perished.
So the children of Israel, to
whom God had promised to

giue the Land of Canaan,
in their iourney towards it,
did not onely not beléeue the
Lord, but murmured against
him saying, Who shall giue
vs flesh to eat? would God we
had died in the land of Aegyt,
or in this Wildernesse:
would God wee were dead,
were it not better for vs to
turne into Aegypt? With
many such reproachful, murmurous
& faithlesse obiurgations,
as well against God
himselfe as against Moses
and Aaron: but for their infidelity,
faintings & murmurings,
God answered their
impious desires to die, he destroyed
them in the Wildernes
in his heauy displeasure.
               
                  
The frailty of a faithlesse
man is great, he can beare
no troubles, hee can endure
no afflictions with any kinde
of patience, because hée hath
no true and sound vnderstanding
of God and his prouidence.
He thinkes if he prosper,
and by his naturall policy
and meanes, can preuent
dangers and troubles, or hauing
them can vse sinister
meanes to ease them, hée ascribes
it to his owne carnall
wisdome; but when that preuaileth
not, but that hée is
pinched and déeply plunged
in distresses and miseries
which he cannot ease; then
hee begins to faint and to
murmur and cry, Who shall

giue mee flesh to eat? How
shall I get mony to supply my
wants? Would God I had died
when I was young; would
God I were dead, and the like.
               The troubles and afflictions
of the wicked and the
godly differ not in the outward
shew: the wicked may
bee poore, so may the most
godly: they may haue like
outward crosses and afflictions,
but their bearing of
them is vnequall; the wicked,
as before is said, faint
and fume, and murmur, and
grudge at euery small crosse
or affliction: and although
they heare the promises of
God, who is ready to helpe,
yet they beléeue them not.

They can bee assured of nothing
that hangs vpon Gods
promises: they would think,
and speake, and obiect against
God, as that Prince
in Samaria did, when Elisha
foretold from the mouth of
God plenty to that distressed
and besieged City: Though
the Lord (said hee) would
make windowes in the Heauen,
could this come to passe?
So incredulous are men
without sound faith, that
once downe, they thinke they
shall neuer rise; once in trouble,
they shall neuer haue
ease: and this is the cause
that men séeming faithfull,
faint vnder their crosses, and
despaire in their afflictions:

but it is otherwise with the
truly faithfull indéed, who
know by the foretelling of
the Spirit of God in his
Word, that troubles attend
the godly as the shadow the
body; and therefore prepare
themselues before hand for
them, and reioyce in them, in
as much as they are partakers
here of Christs sufferings:
So they are likewise
assured, that when his glory
shall appeare, they also shall
appeare with him in glory;
yet the most faithfull may
haue a kinde of fearefulnesse
and fainting for a time, but
not such as shall preuaile,
but they will soone ouercome
all such faithlesse qualmes by

a liuely apprehension of
Gods ready helpe through
faith; and then they may indéed
say as Dauid did, I
should haue fainted except I
had beleeued to see the goodnesse
of the Lord in the land
of the liuing. There is none
of himselfe so strong, but
when troubles and afflictions
come will faint if faith in
God faile them.
               
                  A Prayer that God will not forsake
vs in our troubles, and
that our faith faile not.
                  HAd I not taken hold (O
God) of thy louing promises,

and beleeued thy
Word, I should haue fainted,
and yet should faint vnder my
troubles, if I did not beleeue
that thou, O Lord, knowest
my troubles, and that mine
afflictions are not hid from
thee; thou hast promised to
be a refuge for the poore, a refuge
in due time euen in affliction:
keepe me, O Lord,
as the apple of thine eye according
to thy promise, hide
me vnder the shadow of thy
wings from the wicked that
oppresse me.
                  I haue called vpon thee in
my troubles, O Lord, and cried
vnto thee, my God, and
thou hast heard me and holpen
mee, yea when I haue

beene ready vtterly to haue
fainted, I haue cried vnto thee
and thou hast redeemed mee
and deliuered me. Those mercies
of thine, O Lord, remember
still, renue them euermore
towards mee, for I stand in
continuall need of thy continuall
presence.
                  Thy goodnesse is great, O
Lord, which thou hast laid vp
for them that feare thee, and
done to them that trust in
thee, euen before the sonnes
of men. I haue felt thy fauour,
and formerly tasted of
thy loue. How could I but haue
fainted, but that I still beleeued
to bee partaker of thy
goodnesse and mercy in my
troubles? Thou, O Lord, art

my secret place, thou preseruest
me in trouble, and compassest
me about with ioyfull
deliuerance, therefore will I
not faint, knowing that thine
eies are vpon mee, and thine
eare open vnto my prayers. I
trust in thee, I will not bee afraid
what man can doe vnto
me.
                  Thou Lord hast said concerning
the faithfull; hee shall
call vpon mee and I will heare
him, so that both my prayers
and thy hearing are both
thine owne gifts. Nay, thou
addest further, Lord, I will bee
with him in trouble, I will deliuer
him and glorifie him. O
why should I feare then or
faint, seeing thou art pleased

to be with me in my troubles,
as to take part as it were with
me of mine afflictiōs: wonderfull
and vnspeakable, O Lord,
is the extent of thy power, and
wonderfull the limits of thy
loue; impossible it is to finde
out the depth of thy compassions
towards thy children;
thou hearest vs before we call,
thou giuest before wee aske,
thou helpest vs before wee
cry, thou giuest vs power to
call, thou teachest vs what to
aske, and thou euen meetest
vs when we are but euen comming
vnto thee.
                  Thus gracious hast thou
euer beene, O Lord, thus gracious
thou art, and thus gracious
wilt thou shew thy

selfe vnto them that beleeue
to see and taste of thy goodnesse,
euen vnto the end of
the world; and as thou art
gracious, so art thou absolute
in wisdome; thou knowest
how to releeue the distressed,
and how to comfort the afflicted,
yea when they are ready
to faint, and to giue ouer any
more to call for helpe, being as
it were hoarse with crying as
Dauid was, thou giuest them
of thy water of life, and it reuiueth
the fainting soules, and
strengthneth the weake spirits
that g
                        •
                     oane vnder the
burthen of any calamity or
trouble.
                  Strengthen mee therefore
with thy grace, O Lord, I shall

not then faint nor feare, for
my sure defence is in thee,
who wilt in time bring the
malice of mine enemies to an
end; and as I beleeue, so shall
I see thy goodnesse in the
land of the liuing: for thou
that hast promised it art iust
of thy promises, and powerfull
to performe what thou
hast said. Therefore euen here
I doe meerely beleeue to receiue
at thy hands free release
and pardon of all that hath
beene the ground of my troubles
and cause of my miseries.
Grant mee Lord freedome
from mine enemies, and restitution
of what I haue
beene depriued of by any of
them: then shall they finde

that I haue not onely not
fainted, but beleeued to see
and haue seene thy goodnesse,
O Lord, euen here in
the Land of the liuing, where
euen mine enemies and my
soes shall witnesse that I haue
not beleeued in thee my God
in vaine.
               
            
            
               
               
                  VERSE 14.
                  Hope in the Lord, be strong,
and he shall comfort thine
heart, and trust in the
Lord.
               
               
                  THis verse is a fit
and comfortable
conclusion of this
Psalme; shewing
herein that Dauid
in all his troubles depended
onely on God; and by his
owne experience encourageth
himselfe and all other
men in all kindes of troubles
and afflictions to doe the like;
and then, as he found they

shall finde, that God will neuer
faile nor forsake them
that truly trust in him.
Though Dauid say héere,
Hope in the Lord; he speaks
not to the encouragement of
other men, excluding himselfe:
but rather stirreth 
                     〈◊〉
                  
his owne soule, his faith and
affections; as if hee should
haue said, O my soule, hope
in the Lord: Thou hast proued
the goodnesse of the Lord
sufficiently in all thy troubles:
Thine enemies haue
not preuailed against thée:
Thy foes haue not had their
lust of thee; therefore as thou
hast heretofore hoped; so still
hope in the Lord, faint not,
but be strong; be not afraid

whatsoeuer befalleth thée, or
whosoeuer assaileth thée, be
not dismaied; for he that hath
hitherunto béene thy helper
and refuge, will neuer leaue
thée nor forsake thée, if thou
hope in him and be strong in

                     ••
                  ith. And though thou be in
danger, in trouble, and in
whatsoeuer affliction, and
séest no deliuery present;
trust in the Lord, and hée
will deliuer thée and comfort
thine heart: For if in trouble
and danger there were instant
deliuery, there were no
place for Hope; for Hope is
of things not séene, not of
things presently enioyed.
Wherefore Dauid exhorts
himselfe (as it were) and

others to wait on God for
their deliuery out of their
miseries & troubles, through
faith. Hope in the Lord, wait
on God with faithfull patience:
Grudge not though
troubles arise, though crosses
come, and afflictions befall
thée; be strong, be constant,
take courage, murmur not,
fret not, disquiet not thy
selfe, but be strong, and trust
in the Lord.
               There are some, no doubt,
that can beare troubles,
nay fortures, with a séeming
inuincible patience in an ill
cause; carying themselues
with such a valorous force of
spirit, as if they had the very
Quintessence of faith, and

an vndaunted hope; as wée
may reade of Reualiack, Balthasar,
and other murtherers
of Kings. It is but a patience
without true patience;
for without obedience to
Gods precepts, there is no
true religion; without true
religion, there can bee no
true faith; without true
faith, no true patience; and
therefore that patience that
is shewed in such, and like
capitall murtherers, howsoeuer
constantly they may
séeme to endure their torments,
it is but the delusion
Satan, that while they are
yet breathing, doth stand to
animate them to that séeming
patience, and resolution outward,

which (the parties being
dead) their consciences
shall neuer approue, but their
last gaspe shall carrie that
horror with it, that if it might
after outwardly appeare,
would manifestly testifie,
that as the cause for which
they suffered, was in it selfe
wicked, their punishments
legally and iustly deserued
and inflicted; their patience
would shew it selfe a kinde of
desperate running head-long
into their owne perdition:
Leauing then these men to
their owne Diabolicall
strength, let vs hope in the
Lord, let vs pray to become
strong in him, faithfull in
him, and truly patient in

him in all our sufferings, for
there is no commendable suffering
for euill doing; and
therefore saith S. Paul, speaking
to the faithfull: Let
none of you suffer as a murderer
or a theefe, &c. But if any
man suffer as a Christian,
namely for Christs Gospels
sake, and for well doing, let
him not be ashamed, but let
him glorifie God in this behalfe,
namely, that he is accounted
worthy to suffer for
the truth of Christ.
               
                  Hope in the Lord; Here is
our confidence: Bee strong;
here is our constancy: And
he shall comfort thine heart;
Here is the end of Hope and
strength, comfort of the heart.

Whosoeuer then hopeth of
helpe from any inferior creature,
nay, from an Angell in
heauen, and excludes God;
or standeth vpon his owne
strength, wealth, wisdome,
friends, or worldly policy,
and thinketh by these, or any
of these to be freed from danger,
eased in troubles, or reléeued
in want, exempting
God; nay, if hée take not the
counsell of God, by the direction
of his word and prayer;
his hope will proue but a shadow,
and his strength as the
strength of a Bull-rush.
               
                  Dauid bendeth his eies
from all these, to the loue,
power, and prouidence of
God, in whom and whose

aid he onely taketh for his
strength: assuring himselfe,
that he will not onely send
him outward reléefe according
to his hope; but with
inward ioy and consolation
comfort his heart: Therefore
doth he encourage himselfe
and others, to hope in
the Lord, and not in carnall
meanes: To bee strong in
faith in God, not in ye strength
of humane aid. God must be
totally our hope & strength,
or else he will be no part: for
a hope that is partly in God,
and partly in other meanes,
is not the hope that tieth the
promise of the true comfort,
but that hope that is confirmed
and made strong by

faith. To this hope is a promise
annexed, that when
dangers, enemies and troubles,
beset a man round about,
though he want things
necessary, though sicknesse
afflict him, though crosses
without and griefes within
doe oppresse him, though
friends saile him, and euery
thing séeme to goe against
him, and he be depriued of all
visible meanes to escape;
there remaineth yet hope
in the Lord to be patient, and
not to faint.
               This hope is the gift of
God: But there is a hope
that is common to carnall
men. They hope vpon some
probabilities séene, or conceiued:

As the hope of a son
for the inheritance of a father
or a friend, for something
vpon death to be giuen
them, and the like. This
is not that hope that Dauid
meanes, when he saies hope;
but a certaine kinde of vncertaine
expectation of things
desired. But Dauids hope is
a sauing hope, necessarily
ioyned with saith and a patient
waiting: For that which
we stedfastly beléeue shall
come to passe; and in nothing
is the force of faith and hope
more séene or felt, than in affliction
and trials: For these
bring forth patience, and patience
experience, and experience
hope; which maketh the

godly to reioyce in tribulation,
wherein is glory and no
shame: whereas in carnall
hope there is often shame
and seldome glory.
               Saint Paul was so farre
from being ashamed of his
afflictions, as he gloried in
them, for the hopes sake
that is set before vs all, of a
most excellent issue, and end
of our hope; and as through
the holy Ghost, the God of
hope plentifully filled Paul
with ioy and strength, euen
in his afflictions, and with
peace in beleeuing the promises,
whereby he abounded in
hope, that all his troubles,
trialls, and afflictions should
end with comfort; So let vs

pray vnto the same God of
hope to be filled with like
hope, that our afflictions may
likewise end in comfort;
which though we presently
possesse not, yet let vs with
that blessed Apostle, with patience
wait for it.
               But Pauls hope and patience
aimed to heauenly, not
to earthly accomplishments;
not looking for the euent of
his hope in this life: How
then may his hope of heauenly
glory, and Dauids hope to
be defended and reléeued here
in the land of the liuing concurre?
They may well stand
together: Euen as Christ by
healing of corporall diseases,
made men heauenly minded,

and cleane by forgiuing their
sinnes; so Dauid praied not
so simply for corporall deliuerie,
but he praied also for
the light of the truth, that he
might dwell in the Temple
of God, for mercy, and the
like. And although Paul séemed
by his words to hope
onely for heauenly glory, necessaries
for this life were
necessarily included. He that
duly and truly praies for
heauenly, cannot be frustrate
of earthly: and he that praies
faithfully for earthly, cannot
but therewith ioyne heauenly
blessings; for true and sincere
hope includes both. He
therefore that through faith
in Christ doth hope in the

Lord, and becommeth strong
in him: Hee will comfort
his heart with the supply
both of heauenly and earthly
blessings. As it is lawfull for
vs to pray vnto God for corporall
necessaries; so are wée
bound to hope and wait for
them. Without hope of victory
Dauid would neuer
haue entred the combat with
Goliah.
               
               Wée must therefore hope
in the Lord and bee strong,
trusting in God, and our
hearts shall bee comforted.
We may not looke backe or
about vs for helpe, our helpe
commeth from heauen; therefore
must we not hope, and
hope a hope partly from aboue,

and partly from beneath;
but our hope must bée
in God alone: yet not to contemne
or despise the inferior
meanes that God vseth here
below, as his Instruments
for our good; in whom wée
may haue a kinde of hope, as
Dauid had in Ionathan, that
he would deale faithfully
with him in the matter of
Saul his father: so may wée
hope in man: but our confidence
must be in God alone.
               What God hath promised
in his Word, he will assuredly
performe to them
that truly beléeue. And that
did Dauid finde, euen when
the Crowne was like to bée
taken from his head: Hee

fainted not, but held fast by
the accustomed loue and help
of God, and became strong in
faith, euen when his enemies
were in their fiercest fury against
him. He waited still,
vsing little or no other resistance
against his enemies,
than feruent praier to God,
and his counsell: and his expectation
in patience was not
in vaine; for the Lord subdued
his enemies without
the great force of Dauid; and
thereupon he tooke courage,
he hoped in the Lord, he was
strong in faith, and the Lord
did comfort his heart.
               He sought not as the wicked
doe, sinister and forbidden
meanes to be deliuered:

For when Saul his mortall
enemy pursued him with
deadly malice to take away
his life; yet when Saul fell
into his hands, and had him
twice in his power, and
might haue ended the quarrell,
and fréed himselfe of
danger, he would not doe it,
no, though he might haue
made present way for himselfe
to the kingdome, whose
it was after Saul: yet neither
his owne perill wherein hée
daily stood, through the malice
and fury of Saul, nor his
owne future right to the
Crowne could moue him to
touch the Lords anointed;
contrary to the minds of many
ambitious men, both of

former and latter ages, who
are loth to let slip any opportunitie
offered, be it neuer so
vniust, to aduance their
greatnesse. But Dauid staid
himselfe vpon hope, that God
who had so often deliuered
him, would still doe it without
any vnlawfull meanes of
his owne, and in his time
appointed would aduance
him as he had promised, and
therefore waited the time
with patience, comforting
his heart in the middest of his
dangers. And long it was
not before he came lawfully
to that which before he might
and would not, because hée
hoped in God whom he knew
he should haue offended, if he

had taken the counsel of some
that aduised him.
               There is no hope to that
hope whereunto Dauid encourageth
himselfe & others,
no strength to that strength:
and no mans heart can bée
truly comforted, but by the
comfort wherewith he affirmeth
his heart was comforted:
therefore chéereth he vp
his owne soule with this holy
resolution, to hope in the
Lord, with this heauenly
strength, to be strong in the
Lord, and with that comfort
wherewith he was comforted
of the Lord. There is
a hope that is vaine, a
strength that is weake, and
a comfort that is but counterfeit.

Let vs then take hold
of that hope, & that strength,
and that comfort that is of
God, and trust in him: So
shall we not néed to be afraid
of enemies, to faint in afflictions,
but shall be sure to
finde comfort in all our troubles.
               
                  Salomon saith, that hope
that is deferred, is the fainting
of the heart; but that
is but to the faint-hearted:
For if we wait not, it is no
hope; but if we abide with
patience Gods appointed
time, we shall enioy what we
hope for: And when the desire
commeth it is a tree of
life. And Dauid hauing often
gathered the fruit of this

trée, and fed thereon when he
fainted, he giues here of the
same fruit to others; Hope
(saith he) in the Lord, bee
strong, be not faint-hearted,
though hope be deferred: for
comming the thing we hope
for will tarry no longer than
a conuenient time, and then
it will comfort the heart.
Hope groweth strong, by the
effects of Gods goodnesse formerly
hoped for, and had:
which Saint Paul affirmeth,
encouraging the Corinthians
as Dauid did himselfe and
others, To hope, to be strong,
to trust in the Lord, and to
lay hold vpon the hope that is
set before vs, which hope we
haue as an anker of the soule,

sure and stedfast. And this is
the comfort of the heart that
Dauid meaneth, euen our
faith in God, whereby wée
take hold of the assured performance
of his promises, not
onely of temporall and corporall,
but of spirituall and celestiall
blessings: And the patient
waiting for them is our
Hope.
               
               How then can it bee, that
God who hath promised vnto
the faithfull the life to
come, that with patience in
hope wait for it vnder the
crosse, should not consider &
regard their dangers, troubles,
afflictions, euen in this
life? For if he haue giuen his
Sonne to die for our sinnes,

how should he not with him
giue vs all things to enioy?
Though wée must wait his
time▪ he is not slacke as some
men count slacknesse, but is
alwaies ready and at hand;
he that hath promised, hee is
faithfull and true. Though
the vnfaithfull will not take
his word, not his hand, not
his oath; the faithfull know
and are assured, that he will
neuer faile them, nor forsake
them; Therefore hope in the
Lord, be strong, and he will
comfort thine heart: And
trust in the Lord.
               
               
                  
                  A Prayer for strength, patience,
and hope in troubles.
                  O Father, possessor of Heauen
and Earth, and the
disposer and preseruer of
them and of all things within
the same, the fountaine of
all perfect hope, the giuer of
patience, and maintainer of
our strength; thou knowest
my troubles, and beholdest
mine afflictions, and what and
how many they are, and how
burthensome vnto mee thy
weake creature: in stead therefore
of my weake ability, giue
mee thy preuailing strength,

giue me hope in thee, let mee
be strong in thee, let my comfort
be of thee, and let me truly
trust in thee, then shall I
with patience beare these and
whatsoeuer troubles it shall
please thee to lay vpon me.
                  Arme mee with faith, O
Lord, that I trusting in thy
defence may not sinke vnder
the weight of my troubles
importable to flesh and bloud;
thou hast promised to bee the
God of my saluation, so shall
nothing hurt mee; my glory,
so nothing shall disgrace me;
my rocke and my strength, so
nothing shall moue mee nor
remoue mee from my trust in
thee.
                  I am thine, saue mee, keepe

me as the apple of thine eye,
hide me vnder the shadow of
thy protecting wings, then
shall no enemy annoy mee, no
trouble dismay mee, nor affliction
or feare shall cast mee
downe: by thee I shall withstand
or escape the fury, force,
& fraud of all my foes; by thee
I shall bee timely releeued in
all my necessities, and in thee
shall I bee comforted in all
mine afflictions: I will not
feare, thou art my God; I will
not faint, thou art the comfort
of my heart: Let mee still
taste of thy goodnesse, and behold
thy saluation; in hope
let mee hold fast by thee, in
faith let me be strong in thee,
with comfort let mee reioyce

and be glad in thee.
                  Continue thy mercies towards
mee, O Lord, for my
soule trusteth in thee, knowing
and confessing that I haue
no other Comforter but thee,
no Defender but thee, nor any
Helper but thee: Forsake me
not therefore, O my God, in
my greatest need; send from
Heauen and saue me, for all
power belongeth vnto thee,
therefore doth my soule cleaue
vnto thee, it longeth and thirsteth
for thy saluation.
                  O let mee plentifully taste
how sweet thy goodnesse is;
thy goodnesse appeared in my
creation, more in my redemption,
but most in mine election;
thou formedst me in the

wombe, thou broughtest me
thence, giuing me hope euen
from my Mothers brest, and
I was euen then cast vpon thy
prouidence, therefore leaue
me not nor be farre from mee
now trouble is befalne mee;
but as thou hast taken charge
of me from the beginning, so
continue still to defend me,
for I haue none besides thee
to helpe me, therefore cast I
my burthen vpon thee, for
thou hast taken vpon thee to
nourish me. In thee, O Lord,
I trust, let mee neuer be ashamed
nor confounded, deliuer
me according to thy promise,
for thou art my hope, O Lord,
in thee haue I trusted from my
youth.
                  
                     
Let my prayers, O Lord,
enter into thy presence, heare
me and helpe me, let nothing
hinder the worke of thy mercies
towards me▪ not mine vnworthinesse,
O Lord, but accept
me worthy in thy most
worthy; then shall not the
weaknesse of my faith diminish
my hope, nor extenuate
my strength, nor depriue me
of my comfort in thee; but
my faith, hope, strength and
comfort shall increase more
and more, and patience shal
                        •
                     
haue it perfect working in
me, to wait vntill thine appointed
time come for my deliuery
out of some of my troubles,
for I endure many, O
Lord, and the least of them of

weight more than sufficient
to presse mee downe vnlesse
thou support mee, yet I acknowledge
them easie in
comparison of my euill deseruings.
                  O pardon mine offences,
cleanse me of my sinnes, and
make mee vpright in thy
waies; then shall I with perfect
patience beare my troubles
and rest in hope vntill it
shall please thee to ease me of
my troubles, or to bring them
to an end, which grant gracious
Lord God in Iesus Christ,
to whom with thee and the
holy Ghost, be honour, power▪
and praise for euermore.
Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A Prayer for forgiuenesse of
sinnes, reformation of life,
and comfort in affliction.
                  O My God my God, hide
not thy face from mee,
stop not thine eares at my
prayers, and refuse not to
heare the words of my complaint;
though I cannot but
confesse, O Lord, against my
selfe, that by reason of my sins
I haue deserued thy displeasure,
and that in so high a
measure, as if thou shouldest
vtterly confound me, yet
were there no iniustice in
thee, for the euills that I haue

committed, and the good duties
I haue omitted, in thy
seuere iustice deserue the
same; but Lord looke not so
narrowly into my waies as to
obserue and register against
me euery sinne committed
and euery duty omitted by
me, knowing that I am by
nature corrupt and sinfull, as
all my fathers were.
                  Lord, what were Abraham,
Izaak, Iaacob, Iob, Noah,
Lot, Moses, Eliah, or Dauid,
though a man chosen
after thine owne heart? Paul
that elect vessell, but men by
nature carnall, and euen sold
vnder sinne, vntill thou of
thine owne free mercy vouchsafedst
to infuse heauenly wisdome

into their hearts, and diuine
graces into their soules?
vntill thou diddest fully season
them aboue others by thy holy
Spirit, yet Lord thou knowest,
that euen these select vessels
of thine were not without
their owne naturall infirmities.
They stood not vprightly
by their owne strength, but
by thee; if they had had will
and power of and in themselues
to worke righteousnes,
they might haue had whereof
to boast, but not with
thee; but being only supported
by thee, they gaue the sole
glory to thee.
                  Seeing then, gracious Father,
that all our most godly
fore-fathers had their defects

by nature, and their perfection
through thy grace; I being
corrupt, as they were by nature
borne corrupt, and
brought forth the fruits of
corruption vntill thou begattest
them anew by thy Spirit,
what differ I from them
by nature? And therefore,
Lord, as they became holy,
not of themselues but by thee;
so canst thou make me holy,
as they were holy, by the same
grace.
                  There is none, O Lord,
that by his owne wisdome is
capable of that wisdome
whereby to know thee aright,
how much lesse able by his
owne power to performe that
obedience which may make

him accepted of thee?
                  If then it be, as indeed it is,
of thine owne free mercy and
grace, that any man becomes
wise in thee and righteous before
thee, who hath cause to
boast of his owne merit? Or
who needs despaire of his
owne vnworthinesse, seeing
thou art equally mercifull to
all whom thou hast called and
accepted into the number of
them that shall be saued?
                  O send downe, send downe
from Heauen, that thy sanctifying
Spirit into my heart,
that that liuely faith whereby
our most godly fore-fathers
were accepted of thee, may be
more and more inkindled,
and breake forth into a holy

flame of godlinesse and zeale,
and my whole man be changed
into the same image of
sanctity, which appeared in
them in whom thou most delightest;
then thou my God,
now deseruedly offended with
me for my sinnes past, shalt
bee so fully reconciled vnto
me againe, though not by my
best renued workes, which are
and will be for euer here imperfect;
but through the merits
and mediation of thine
owne and onely Sonne, whose
death is my life, and thy mercies
in him my saluation.
                  This is my hope, O Lord,
though I bee yet in the estate
of corruption, and enforced
to vndergoe infinite infirmities

of body and minde by nature.
Thou who art the God
of Abraham, and of all our
godly fore-fathers dead to the
world, art no lesse the same
God vnto those that are thine
yet liuing in the world. And
as they already dissolued, are
now in glory with thee in
the Heauens, so confirme my
faith in thee and order my
waies, that I being likewise
dissolued through Christ my
Redeemer, may be also glorified
with them, and with them
giue glory to thee.
                  Make me therefore, gracious
Father, to abound here, as
they here abounded in all spirituall
graces and heauenly
vertues, that I may finde thee

a like louing father vnto me, as
thou wert a father vnto Abraham,
and a helping God, as
thou wert vnto Iaacob, and
then shall I offer, euen here,
the sacrifice of vnfained praise
vnto thy name, and make
mine humble prayers vnto
thee, in his name whose death
and mediation thou acceptest
aboue all other whatsoeuer sacrifices.
                  O accept that his sacrifice,
made once for all, for all beleeuers;
it is sufficient, Lord,
to purge me from all my sins
that formerly haue offended
thee, and to keepe mee from
future wilfully displeasing
thee.
                  My sinnes, O Lord, I doe

confesse haue worthily moued
thee to correct me: I feele
thy rod, but the rod of a louing
father, not to confound
me, but to confirme me, not to
destroy me, but to saue me.
                  O let me not faint vnder thy
correcting hand, which thou
hast promised shall be no more
heauily laid vpon mee than I
shall be able to beare.
                  Let not therefore, Lord, my
faith faile me, but let perfect
patience haue it effectuall
working in me; then whatsoeuer
it shall please thee to appoint
mee to beare, I shall
beare it, for my heart through
thy grace is prepared to obey
thee.
                  Thou hast beene euer my

helper since I was borne, thou
hast vpholden me, sustained
and relieued mee, O forsake
me not now when all carnall
helpe faileth me.
                  There is no certaine hope
in the helpe of man; though
he promise, he may be vnable
or vnwilling to performe; if
he yeeld me helpe it is of thee,
and among thy promised
meanes of helpe; and nothing
hindreth the performance of
thy promise of helping mee,
but the weaknesse of my faith
in not stedfastly beleeuing,
mine impatience in not willingly
bearing, and my want
of liuely hope in not contentedly
waiting thine owne
good time in effecting what

thou hast promised.
                  Yet I haue hope, louing Father,
that comming, thy helpe
will come, and that in a time
most cōuenient in thine owne
wisdome, although through
mine infirmity I thinke it
long, but when it commeth,
it shall be as a Well, not only
of releeuing but of liuing water,
springing vp not onely to
my corporall comfort, but to
my spirituall & eternall glory.
                  In the meane time, O Lord,
let mee euermore taste of thy
goodnesse, that I faint not
vnder the burthen of my troubles,
but as thou hast worthily
corrected me, so vouchsafe
mercifully to relieue me.
                  In hope and assurance of

this thy mercy, O Lord, I
commend and commit my
selfe, my soule and body, vnto
thy fatherly disposing, for
thou hast promised to take
care of me, therefore cast I my
care vpon thee, not as carelesse
of mine owne duty, but in a
liuely faith going forward,
waiting thy leisure and thy
good pleasure, when thou
wilt come and how thou wilt
deliuer me, O Lord, make no
long tarrying, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  An effectuall Prayer for forgiuenesse
of sinnes.
                  O Lord, when I doe consider
the account that I
am to make for the time which

I haue so sinfully spent in this
life, and how I haue walked
here as in a Wildernesse of all
impieties: I feele my conscience
burthened with so heauy
a weight of feare and trembling,
that I am cast downe
as into a gulph of ineuitable
danger, and know not which
way to turne mee with any
hope of comfort: if I turne
me to the consideration of my
best workes, I finde them rather
to aggrauate than to extenuate
my feare: if I appeale
vnto thee as thou art a seuere
Iudge, I shall be condemned
in thy iust iudgement; I therfore
as the prodigall son, doe
vpon the knees of mine vnfained
heart fall downe before

thee, imploring mercy though
I deserue it not; but Lord, I
know that in thy seuerest iustice
thou art accustomed to remember
mercy, and in thy
hottest displeasure thou shewest
compassion euen to greatest
sinners, euen vpon their
vnfained desire to repent:
how much more vpon their
actuall and sincere repentance,
especially of such as
through a liuely faith take
hold of Christ, who hath taken
vpon him to stand betweene
thy iustice and a sinner.
O accept his death and
merits for the forgiuenesse of
my sinnes, who by reason of
them am become deepely indangered
and indebted vnto

thee. And if thou shouldest
exact the vttermost farthing
at my hands, I were neuer able
to make the least satisfaction;
and the more hardly can
I answer the committing of
so many sinnes, and the omitting
of so many good duties,
by how much I haue receiued
a great measure, yea many talents
of grace, and a great
portion of heauenly knowledge
at thy hands, which I
should haue vsed, not onely to
the good of mine owne soule,
and comfort of mine owne
conscience, but to the increase
of spirituall knowledge in others,
whom I should haue endeuoured
to haue drawne to
the obedience of thy will by

the example of mine obedience.
                  Alas, good Father, such hath
beene the neglect of my duty
in this behalfe, that I haue
not onely laid these heauenly
treasures vnder the earthly
corruption of mine owne
heart, but haue laid out the
wicked dregs of originall sin,
and haue therewith gained
vnto my selfe infinite iniquities
and innumerable actuall
sinnes, in so much as iniustice
thou maist condemne me as a
most vnprofitable disposer of
thy manifold graces: and the
more, good Father, by how
much I haue not onely sinned
my selfe, and that oftentimes,
as it were, with a high

hand, but in alluring and stirring
vp others to sinne by
mine example; nay Lord, many
times by mine owne instigation,
and thereby the more
dangerously drawne downe
thy displeasure vpon my selfe,
and them that haue sinned by
the example of my sinne.
                  Lord, what shall I say to
excuse me? What shall I bring
vnto thee to appease thee? If
I say the corruption of mine
owne nature prouoked mee,
and I did sinne; thou hast
commanded mee to mortifie
the deeds of my corrupt flesh
by thy Spirit. If I pleade that
the world allured mee and I
did sinne, thou hast forbidden
mee to loue the world or

the things in the world: if I
say Satan inticed me, and I
did sinne, thou hast commanded
me to resist Satan and his
tentations, so that though I
plead with Adam, that my
Heuah, my carnall part that
thou gauest me, did moue me
and I did sinne, it will be no
excuse for mee; if I say the
world allured, or Satan tempted
me, it booteth me not: and
therefore, Father, I cannot
but freely confesse against my
selfe, that I, euen I haue sinned,
and done all these euills
against thee, against thee, O
Lord, I haue sinned, & against
my selfe, and haue deseruedly
stirred vp thy displeasure against
me, and in thy displeasure
is death.
                  
                     
This, this, O Lord, is the
gaine that my sinnes haue
gotten, not onely a dissolution
of the soule and body due to
all flesh: but the death of body
and soule due onely to
impenitent sinners, among
whom I, euen I, acknowledge
my selfe worthy to bee numbred
without thy mercy. For
who hath power, Lord, by
his owne corrupt nature to
repent? By nature, Lord, I
sinne: How can I by the same
sinfull part, repent of that
wherein nature it selfe delighteth?
A fountaine bringeth
not forth bitter water and
sweet: How then Lord can I
bring forth true repentance
out of a corrupt heart, as it is

corrupt? Yet Lord, though
my heart bee corrupt by nature,
being made in part sincere
and holy by thy grace, it
shall so farre forth worke repentance,
as is thy grace powerfull
and effectuall in me. So
that though sinne by nature
dwell in me, by thy grace may
sanctity also; as Esau and Iaakob
in Rebeccahs wombe, striuing
for superiority.
                  Therefore, good Father, as
Esau the elder, gaue place and
became seruant to Iaakob: So
let sinne, which is in me the
first borne, giue place in mee
vnto sanctity: And let sanctity
haue the sole dominion in
my heart, then shall my heart
bring forth the good fruits of

a godly life: though while I
liue here, the weeds of corruption
will also grow; but
Lord, let them not ouergrow
the good seed of thy spirit: but
let them wither and die before
they grow vp to beare any
fruit vnto death. But feed me
now at the last with the most
wholesome fruits of thy spirit,
and giue me grace to expresse
my sorrow for my sins that I
haue done with an inward relenting
heart, grieued that euer
I contriued sin in my inward
thoughts, that euer I
acted it, or consented vnto it.
                  Lord see and behold my sorrow
for my sins, if it bring not
forth sincere repentance, water
it so with thy mollifying spirit,

that it may worke in mee
that which may testifie that I
repent indeed: so that sinne
may become loathsome vnto
me, and sanctitie sweet. And
although while I carrie about
me this vnholy lump of earth,
my best exercises cannot but
sauour of the fountaine from
whence they flow; if of corruption,
corruptly; if of thy
spirit, heauenly.
                  O season therefore my
heart, O Lord, my soule and
whole man with thy spirit,
that whatsoeuer I thinke,
speake, or doe, may sauour
from aboue, that I may feele in
my heart and soule a true and
liuely detestation of whatsoeuer
sauoureth of the loue of

this world; as the lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eies, and
the pride of life.
                  Giue me strength to performe
all perfect obedience in
all righteousnesse, euen to the
forgetting of sinne. And yet
to remember my sinnes past,
and to repent them, that thou
my louing Father, before
whose presence I presently
stand, maiest bee pleased to
turne thy louing and fatherly
countenance in mercy towards
me, in the merits and
mediation of Christ my Reedeemer.
                  Let these mine humble petitions,
O Lord, ascend vp vnto
thee; and let the infallible
tokens of thy mercies appeare

towards mee: that my heart
now cast downe for feare of
thy iudgements, may bee againe
lifted vp, feeling the inward
testimonies of thy mercies
in Christ. To whom with
thee and the holy Ghost, be
all honour, praise, and glory.
               
               
                  A Praier for the morning,
with thankes for rest and
safetie.
                  O Father, mercifull and euermore
louing in Iesus
Christ, who this night past
hast beene a powerfull and
prouident Watch-man ouer
me, euen when by the deadnesse
of sleepe I was depriued,

euen of sense, care or feare of
any danger, which yet without
thy preseruation and prouidence,
might suddenly haue
seized vpon me, and that by
infinite meanes: For, Lord,
thou knowest what a malicious
and watchfull Aduersary
we haue, who is attended on
by a troupe of infernall Ministers
that hourely seeke by
some meanes to surprize vs:
Besides the corruption of our
owne nature, that is alwaies
working in vs sinfull
thoughts, vncleane desires,
and most vngodly affections:
mouing vs in our night-wakings
(in stead of holy meditation
and godly praier) to
purpose the committing of

infinite sorts of sinnes, when
we enter into the day, hauing
no meanes to preuent the execution
of most sinfull actions,
but by thine owne most gracious
working holy feare
and godly obedience in our
hearts: Wherefore, louing
Father, I come this morning
into thy holy presence, from
which I cannot hide mee,
and vpon the knees of my
heart I vnfainedly intreat
thee, that as it hath pleased
thee this night to preserue
me, and giuing me comfortable
rest and sleepe in safetie; so
thou wilt be pleased to watch
ouer mee this day that no
danger befall me, either in
body, soule, or any thing belonging

vnto me; But that I
may be so led vnder the pauilion
of thy protection, guided
by thy spirit, that neither in
thought, word or deed I may
offend thee; endeuouring to
performe all holy and heauenly
duties vnto thee my
God, who for all thy mercies
requirest onely pure and sincere
obedience, which is also
thy gift: for none by his owne
power can thinke a good
thought, much lesse Lord,
worke any thing pleasing vnto
thee, but the contrary:
therefore disclaime I all mine
owne merit, and cleaue onely
vnto thy mercy in Iesus
Christ; Humbly beseeching
thee for his sake to take

charge of me this day: preuent
the malicious intentions
of Satan and his ministers:
mortifie mine owne sinfull
affections, and infuse into my
heart all diuine graces, that my
waies this day may nothing
sauour of sinne, but of sanctitie.
And as I haue by thee safely
passed this night; so I may
begin, continue and end this
day, and all the daies of my
life, in thy faith, feare, and obedience.
And that in all
mine actions whereunto I am
bound by my place and calling,
I may so walke and so
performe them, as that thy
blessing
                        •
                      may accompany
whatsoeuer I endeuour. Giue
me Lord an vpright heart, asking;

and let me euer receiue
counsell from thee, to be guided
in whatsoeuer I purpose:
that so prospering, the glory
may bee thine, to whom all
power, wisdome, strength,
and glory belongeth, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  A Praier to be vsed before a
man goes to his rest.
                  LOrd, as it hath now pleased
thee to bring mee in
safetie to the end of this day,
and hast therein by many
blessings testified thy fatherly
care ouer me: so let my heart
within me through faith, and
faithfull obedience, testifie
mine vnfained thankfulnesse

to thee. The light of this day
hath afforded vnto mee that
benefit which the darknesse
of the night could not,
though to thee the day and
night are of equall light; for
with thee is no darknesse at
all. But to me, as I am blinde
by nature, the day and night
are of like darknesse and obscuritie:
though the light of
the day discouer visible creatures,
yet as long as the darkenesse
of the ignorance of heauenly
things possesseth my inward
parts, I see not at all as I
ought to see: the light of the
day doth administer vnto my
corporall eies many outward
obiects, which often causeth
me inwardly to erre, and outwardly

to goe astray, as the
sinnes which I haue this day
committed, by the miscarriage
of mine eye may witnesse
against me. Forgiue it Lord
vnto me, and grant that the
light which thou hast created
good, turne not through my
corruption to thy dishonour
and my shame, but as the light
of the day is a most especiall
blessing to the good, to doe
good offices in this life; so let
me vse it to the doing of the
works of diuine light, not of
darknesse. Let it hence-forth
serue vnto mee as a Motiue to
the Contemplation of that
celestiall-light, that is neuer
ouershadowed with darknesse;
and to the obseruation of

thine immensurable greatnesse
and power in creating
and preseruing of thy Creatures,
(visible) numberlesse.
Giue me grace, that I beholding
the infinite works of thy
hands, may with diuine modesty
consider thy wisdome in
framing and disposing them;
thy deepe and vnfathomable
prouidence, in oftentimes
turning those things to the
comfort of those that are
thine, which their enemies
suppose and hope will tend to
their confusion. This also is
thy doing, maruellous in the
eies of such as either know
thee not, or that thinke all
things to come to passe without
thy direction and limitation.
                  
                     
Lord I haue this day found,
that thy wisdome hath directed
me, thy power hath preserued
mee, and thy prouidence
guided me. And in thy
great mercy I haue finished
this day in safetie, and receiued
many blessings at thy
hands; acknowledging yet
my selfe vnworthy of the
least of them, by reason that I
haue many waies offended
thee. Though I haue not noted
in my thoughts all my
sinnes, yet thou knowest
them: And if the righteous
man fall seuen times a day,
how often haue I that am all
corrupt, sinned this day?
None is so iust as sinneth
not, but he is blessed to whom

thou (O Lord) imputest it
not.
                  Sinners couet secrecy, they
hate to be seene, but loue the
sinne: darknesse is their desire,
and the night is as a Closet
to hide them in conceit,
when thou, O God, seest their
actions in the darke as at
noone day. O preserue mee
in thy light, Lord, and grant
I neuer couet to doe that in secret,
whereof I should be ashamed
to commit it openly:
and euen this night now
come vpon mee, vouchsafe
Lord to ouerspread the bright
beames of thine all shining
light ouer me that sinne enter
not into my heart in the
darknesse of the same. And

let me make my night wakings
as interims gained for
Meditation and Praier; And
that I may spend the intermissions
of my sleepe in preparing
my selfe to my finall rest:
That through thy power and
prouidence, I may rest safely
this night, free from all danger
of soule and body: And
that rising againe in the morning,
I may not bee forgetfull
to giue thee the glory. And as
the night succeedeth the day,
and the day the night; so let
my faithfull praiers succeed
holy Meditation, and a holy
endeuour to worke righteousnesse,
succeed my faithfull petitions.
                  Let thine eares be open vnto

my praiers: Let thine eies
(by way of blessing) be vpon
all mine actions: Let thy prouidence
preuent whatsoeuer
mischiefe, Satan, or any mine
enemies his complices shall
plot, practise, or endeuour to
execute against me: In hope
whereof, I doe commit and
commend my selfe, my soule
and body, and whatsoeuer
concerneth me, into thy most
powerfull protection this
night, in the name of Christ,
thine alone beloued. To
whom with thee and the holy
Ghost be ascribed, as most
due, all honour, praise and
glory for euer, Amen.
                  
                  Lord euermore increase
my faith.
