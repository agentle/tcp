            ¶The prologue of the auctour.
            
               Upon a certayne tyme as it befell
               I was all pensyfe and thoughtfull in my herte
               For sondry thynges whiche I knewe full well
               Coude not be remedyed as touchynge my parte
               Wherfore I ymagynynge from me to astarte
               Suche thoughtes & fātasies comynge thrugh ydeues
               And euen so I began this lytell mater or prosses
            
            
               For as I haue redde in bokes and in storyes olde
               Of all vyces the chefe rote of Idelnes
               And yf it be as wyse men haue tolde
               Whiche veryfyenge of the same playnly dyde expres
               That of all synnes Slouthe is chefe maystres
               Into the whiche lest I sholde fall I made for fere
               This treatyse callyd ye chaunce of the dolorous louer
            
            
               Not for no prasynge but my spyrytes to wake
               Whiche at that tyme were full rude and dull
               And so I you requyer that you wyll it take
               Whiche that dothe entende for to rede it full
               Or it to here and so I trust that you wyll
               That slouthe to auoyde whiche enemy is to vertue
               Thys werke I toke in honde that after dothe ensewe
            
            ¶Thus endeth the prologue.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶Here foweth a lytell treatyse called The chaunce of the dolorous louer.
            
               AS it fortuned me for passe
               Thrughe straunge countres my solace to take.
               Whan the feldes were resplendent and couered with grasse
               And with swete herbes and floures delycate
               And byrdes melodyously syngynge on euery busshe or stake
               I mene in the pleasaunt tyme of Autom
               Whiche nexte vnto vere may haue the chefe rome
            
            
               And thus as I rode my selfe all alone
               Musynge of thynges that were in tymes past
               By the space of thre dayes and than aboute none
               My waye I dyde lose by rydynge ouer fast
               Than I was full sory yet at the last
               A pleasaunt way I founde I thanke god of his grace
               In whiche I entred and rode in an esye pace
            
            
               For my Journayes whiche I had the dayes afore
               And also the wayes that I had reden wronge
               Had made me full wery and also faynte and sore
               That ferther on my hors I coude not endure longe
               Wherfore I thought me to rest & wt yt I herde asonge
               Nere by whiche was so melodyous and swete
               That all my werynes I dyde all forgete
            
            
               
               ¶To knowe what it myght be I had grete purpose
               Wherfore thyderwarde full fast I dyde me hye
               And then before me I sawe a grene close
               Enuyronned with grete trees & hedges full strongly
               Yet not withstandynge I entred pryuely
               In at the gate wiche open then I founde
               And there I tyed my horse & lyghted on the grounde.
            
            
               ¶And whan I within this close entred was
               Beynge nothynge rounde but of compas quadrant
               I behelde it well in euery corner and place
               Sayenge to my selfe that suche another skant
               Coulde not be founde of floures so habundaunt
               As was this lytell close whiche before truely
               I herde the songe that was songe so swetely
            
            
               ¶And in beholdynge this felde rounde aboute
               Ryght agaynst me then dyde I espye
               A waye whiche as this close wente out
               Also in another place truely
               I sawe a byrde whiche sange full hye
               Upon foure floures castynge so swete a sauour
               yt they quyckened my spyrytes wt theyr doulcet odour
            
            
               ¶And euer this byrde full plesauntly dyde synge
               With her sugered notes very lowde and shyll
               That all aboute ye place her Iocoūde voyce dyd rynge
               Whom dylygently to here I stode full softe and styll
               And to vnderstonde I fyxed my mynde and wyll
               The dytte of her songe whyche was so certayne
               God sende euery true louer his lady to optayne
            
            
               
               ¶Than to this swete byrde or auys I 
                     〈◊◊◊〉
                   nere
               And as I wente I stombled on a busshe
               And almost had a fall and with a ragged bryere
               I was constrayned to make a grete russhe
               Wher with she was a ferde and sodaynly dyde flusshe
               And wolde no longer tary but with all her myght
               Frō thens I wyst not whyther fast she toke her flyght
            
            
               ¶Than I was full sory whan I sawe her gone
               Not withstondynge I knewe there was no remedy
               And streyght vnto the place I walked all alone
               From whiche a lytell before I dyde se her flye
               And whan I was this foresayd place by
               I wyst not well wheder I dyde wake or slepe
               So grete a swetnes in to my stomake dyde bete
            
            
               ¶And whā I was reuyued & come to my selfe agayne
               I behelde ye meruaylous facyon of this foresayd place
               Whiche was square and also lowe and playne
               Compassed rounde about with hye herbes and gras
               So that no man myght se in but at one space
               Whiche was opyn wherin to entre I dyde purpose
               Thynkynge there my selfe for to repose
            
            
               ¶And whan I had entred in this lytell gardyn grene
               Whiche full smothe and lowe was with herbes
               In all my lyfe I had neuer sene
               An arbour that was so pleasant I wys
               Wherin stode in the myddes
               Of this sayd place foure delycyous floures
               Castynge meruaylous swete & delycyous sauoures
            
            
               
               ¶

                   whiche I wente & downe by them dyd lye
               And ouer this as I lay ryght well I dyde beholde
               What herbes and floures they were yf I coude dyscry
               Then of all theyr names I might rede as I wolde
               The fyrst letters whiche were of beten golde
               Syngulerly set on euery floure aboue
               Growyng after the maner of a goodly trewe loue
            
            
               The fyrste floure to my thynkynge was of a crymsyn pure
               Hauynge an A wryten hym vpon
               Whiche stode for ȳe fyrst letter of his name I was right sure
               Yet what floure it was I lay musynge longe
               And whan I had all studyed yet knewe I none
               Name that it had wherfore I was right sore
               For it passed all other in swetenes and beaute
            
            
               ¶The seconde floure was a vyolet full swete
               That had on hym wryten of hys name the fyrst lettre
               Whiche was an. U. bothe fayre and grete

               Was Isope of sauour bothe good and holsome
               Whiche had for his name an I vpon hym wryten

               Sodaynly was chaunged all my mery chere

               With greuous grones and syghes more and wore
               So that in fayth it was no grete wondre
               Though in a hundrede peaces it had brast a sondre
