            TO
THE READER.
            
               AS Contemplation
in generall, is a
pure act of the
soule; so contemplation
of diuine
things, is most proper vnto it.
This is the heauenly Manna,
whereon it feedeth; heereby it
groweth, heereby it is loosened
from the knots of flesh & blood;
heereby it mounteth aboue the
narrow confines and limits, aboue
the sordide things of this

world, aboue either the threats
or promises thereof; and both returneth
to the originall from
whence it came, and applieth it
selfe to the end whither with
swift celerity it paceth. And
this is an inuincible argument
of the diuine nature of the soule,
if it takes delight in matters diuine;
if it be busied therein, not as
in other mens affaires, but as in
the owne. Assuredly, in nothing
else man is so much man, as
in contemplation of heauenly
things. Oh! how contemptible
a thing is man, if hee aduanceth
not aboue humane cogitations?
            
               
But conceiue heere with (gentle
Reader) that contemplation
is but a fruitlesse action of the
soule, vnlesse it be thereby enflamed
to loue. Contemplation
is a worke of the vnderstanding,
& hath no perfection in it selfe▪
but is a way and meanes to some
degree of perfection, by eleuating
the will to a diuine loue and vnion
with GOD. The vnderstanding
giueth not foode to
the soule, but prepareth it onely
for the taste of the will. Good
is the proper obiect of the will.
And therefore when the will findeth
an infinite depth of goodnesse
in GOD, it shalbe exceeding

icie, if it burne not like a
Phoenix, in the fire of diuine loue,
which by contemplation is therein
kindled. Wherefore, if thou
wilt contemplate sweetely and
profitably, erect the forces of thy
will, to loue that which thou doest
vnderstand: for otherwise, thou
shalt bee but a cold and curious
speculator; thou shalt neuer arriue
at the true end of contemplation.
For the end of contemplating
is not in speculation of
the vnderstanding, but in an ardent
loue of the will.
            Now because of all diuine
things none is more Noble then
the worke of our redemption;

none wherein GOD so much manifested
his goodnesse, and consequently,
none so fit to enflame
our loue: I haue addressed my
Sabbaoth exercises this present
yere, to this prayer of CHRIST
vpon the Crosse for his enemies.
Hoping notwithstanding, that
the residue of the penitentiall
Psalmes, not yet comprised in
my Dauids Teares, shall hereafter
bee in the like manner prosecuted;
either by my selfe (if
life continue) or by some other
more happie and industrious
hand.
            Assuredly, man is too mortall,
either to handle or to knowe

things immortall: As wee
know but in part, so wee can
expresse but a part of what wee
know; and must haue many partners
in our labours therein. A
man should so endeauour to liue,
as he may doe good to all: But
if that cannot bee, yet to many:
and if not that, yet to some: and
if not that, at least to himselfe.
My desire hereby is to doe good
to all; euen to him, whose prefrict
malice hath much wronged
both me and himselfe; in case he
hath either conscience or shame
to bee wounded by a lasting memory
of his dishonest dealings.
            But albeit, I esteeme both

these to bee almost impossible alike;
yet I make no doubt, but
hereby I shall doe good to many:
and the rather, because manie
haue acknowledged to mee great
good, which they haue receiued
by my former writings in this
kinde. But as in the same
meddow, the oxe seeketh grasse,
the hound a hare, and the storke
a lizard: so I expect that in this
worke some will hunt after conceits,
some after cauils; but many
wil find good pasture for their
soules. Of these I expect no other
recompence, but their prayers
for mee; of which I acknowledge
I stand much in need.

            THE
PRAYER
OF
CHRIST
VPON THE CROSSE
for his enemies.
            
               ¶Father forgiue them, for they
know not what they doe.
            
            
               WHen our Sauiour
CHRIST
had trauelled
vp the high
hill Golgotha,
               Christs trauailing vp the Mount.
loaden with his ponderous
Crosse; his body much enfeebled
with fasting & watching

all the night before, &
with the buffetting and
scourging which hee endured:
being much exhausted
thereby, both of spirit and
blood: heere the Iewes first
vnburthened him of his
Crosse, prepared the holes
for fastening him thereto;
brought the hammer and
the nailes before his face; his
enemies clustering the whilest
about him, and not sparing
to vexe him with many
opprobrious and blasphemous
speeches.
            Then they hastily pulled
off his apparell;His stripping which cleauing
fast to his body, by reason

of the congealed blood
that issued from him when
he was scourged; tore open
his wounds, and rent away
some part of his skinne and
flesh. So hee stood naked
and bloody a while; and
then they rudely threw him
vpon the Altar of the Crosse
lying vpon the ground.His nailing. And
applying the backeside of
one of his hands to a hole
which they had prepared in
the Crosse,Psal. 71. 
               They smote the
rocke and riuers gushed foorth:
they nayled his hand to the
Crosse, and blood streamed
Abundantly frō the wound.
            
               
One hand being thus fastened,
they violently streyned
the other, to a hole that
had beene prepared on the
other arme of the Crosse;
and there in like sort fastned
it with a nayle. Then with
great force they stretched
his body downeward, vntill
they had drawen his feet to
the lower hole: and there
in like maner they were fastned
with a naile.How he was strained. By which
strong strayning of his body,
that of the Prophet Dauid
was fulfilled:Psal. 21. 
               I am powred
foorth like water. That
is, I melt away and dissolue
with extremity of torments:

I haue no more strength to
subsist, then water that is
powred foorth. And againe,
All my bones are out of ioint▪
they pierced my hands and my
feet; they haue numbred all my
bones. For his calamity was
so great, partly by his owne
feeblenesse and ariditie, and
partly by the cruell stretching
of his members, that his
ioints were loosed, and pulled
from their firme fastnes
and seates; by reason whereof,
his bones might haue
beene numbred.
            Then they took the woodden
Altar charged with this
bloudy sacrifice,The Crosse erected. and set the

lower end to fall with the
full weight, into a pit which
they had prepared for erecting
thereof; by which fall,
and by fasting it afterward,
the body nayled thereto,
was grieuously shaken. And
so was the brasen serpent
lift vp in the wildernesse;Numb. 21. so
were the sacrifices offered to
GOD,
               Exod. 29. accustomed to be lift
on high.Leuit. 23. And so was it fit,
that hee should bee lift vp,
who was appointed to be a
mediator betweene GOD
and man; who was to reconcile
heauen and earth together;
who was to cast about
his eyes, in seeking his

lost sheep; and vpon whom
we all should set our eies.
            And they would not crucifie
him alone,With whom he was crucified. but between
two theeues, whereby their
intention was to obscure his
Name, to defile his credit;
to make him in stead of Messias,
to bee reputed a prince
of theeues: But our Sauiour
turned this to another end;
namely, that hee died for
sinners, and that he hath discharged
the price of their
sinnes. Doubtlesse he so loueth
sinners, that he did not
onely conuerse with them,
during his life, but died betweene
them, and will bee euer

present among them; to
heare them, to pray for them,
to pardon them when they
call vpon him: not onely during
the time of their liues,
but vntill the last minute of
their death. Yea after death
he will bee ready to receiue
them being penitent, into
his glory.
            THY SAVIOR being thus
mounted vpō the Crosse,Asoliloquie
and fastned hand & foot for
sacrificing of his life; consider
seriously (O my soule)
what he did, what he said, in
what thoughts he was busied.
First consider his vnspeakeable

torments, in that
he was depriued of all comforts;
both externall from
others, and internall within
himselfe. If he stirred any
part of his body, his wounds
were thereby made more
grieuous. If hee remained
quiet, besides that immobility
is a terrible torment,
one of the torments of helBind him hand and foote, and cast him into vtter darkenesse.;
the very weight of his body
did teare his wounds wider.
Then consider how
in those extremities, the first
time he opened his lips, the
first voyce which his tongue
did forme, was in making intercession
for his enemies:

               Father forgiue them, for they
know not what they doe. They
mocked, reuiled, blasphemed;
but hee prayed: the
more they burned in hate,
the more was hee enflamed
with loue. Out of the aboundance
of the heart the mouth
speaketh: and from the aboundance
of his loue did
this prayer proceed.
            But thinke not (O my
soule) that these were all the
words which IESVS spake,
that this was all his prayer
at large; but rather a summary
collection thereof.Heb. 5. 7. For
the Apostle saith that he di
                     •
                  
offer vp prayers & supplications

with strong crying and teares.
And therfore when he seemed
silent, when his voyce
was not heard, when happilie
his lippes did not moue;
whilest the Iewes were busied,
some in tormenting, and
some in deriding him: conceiue
(O my soule) that thy
sweet IESVS, either as senceles,
or as regardles heereof,
was wholy attentiue in praying
to his heauenly Father:
for them, for thee, and for all
sinners. And so, his members
being strongly streyned vpon
the Crosse, as the strings
were on Dauids harpe, hee
made such tunable harmony,

as neuer before had been
heard in the world; sounding
in this sort to the eare
of his Fathers mercy.
            
               HIS PRAYER
EXTENDED.
               O Most iust, most mercifull,His praying.
most holy Father! thou
seest what a weighty worke I
haue begun: and now I am entred
into two of my great offices.
The office of a Priest, as well in
offering my body for a sacrifice,
as in making supplications for
the people: and the office of an
Aduocate; in pleading the cause
of sinners before thee. In both

these heare me, I pray thee. Heauenly
Father, load this bruised
body of mine with thy stripes;
powre foorth the full measure of
thy wrath vpon it: I am ready
to indure whatsoeuer charge it
shall please thee to impose. But
forgiue them, I beseech thee, for
whom I thus suffer. Let mee
not in this cruell maner lose my
blood, and lose them also for
whom I expend it: the price being
paied, suffer me, I pray thee,
to enioy my purchase.
               O my eternall Father! In
recompence of my obedience to
thy will, in recompence of my
comming into the world to reconcile
it to thee, in recompence

of all my trauailes ouer-paced, in
recompence of my present torments
and death: I intreat nothing
of thee, but that thou wilt
pardon these mercilesse sinners.
I am well content that thou
wouldest not yeelde to my naturall
desire when I prayed for my
selfe, that this cup might passe
from me; but denie mee not (I
pray thee) in praying for these.
For I esteeme the benefit greater
that they be forgiuen, then
that this cup should haue passed
from me; I regard more the
good that they liue eternally,
then I regard the hurt that for
the present I die. O my good
Father! there is a time to pardon,

and a time to punish: but
if euer there be a time to pardon,
it is now. Euen now, when I aske
forgiuenes at the very end of
my life; now whilest my blood
freshly runneth for forgiuenes,
whilest the sacrifice is in offring,
for which thou shouldest forgiue.
For now thou doest publikly proclaime
thy pardō: mercy & truth,
iustice & peace, do now embrace,
and kisse kindly together. Thou
didst once forgiue the Israelites,
O my Father! when Moses and
Aaron offered a little incense
for them; and wilt thou not forgiue
these for whom I wholly offer
my selfe? Thou didst once
grant victory when Moses held

vp his hands vnto thee; and
wilt thou nothing regard the
stretching foorth of my bleeding
hands? Father! I am come into
the world, I now suffer death in
the world to appease thine anger:
but what profit will ensue of
my comming and of my death, if
men should be still charged with
thy hate? If my death cannot appease
thy wrath, what then can
doe it? What then can make atonement
betweene thee and sinners?
O my good Father! when
I came into the world by thy appointment,
when by thy appointment
I vndertooke to die: thou
diddest promise that thy wrath
should bee extinguished by my

death; that thy wrath and my
life should determine together.
Wherefore to discharge thy promise,
and because my life is more
precious to thee then thy wrath;
forgiue, I pray thee, and bee appeased.
Loe heere I set my selfe
in the breach;Ezek. 22. loe heere I enterpose
betweene sinners and thee.
               BVT, O great Mediator!
wherfore doest thou so
earnestly entreat for sinners?
What ease is this to thy torments?
what good to thy
selfe? In case thou wilt not
reuenge thy wrongs, yet
wherefore doest thou not
leaue them to thy fathers
pleasure? wherefore should

not Iustice run her course?
The Law sayth, Eie for eie,
hand for hand, life for life▪
                  
And what auayleth it thee,
that these offendours must
now be forgiuen?
               
                  O! YES: I am well content
O my Father! that thou load me
with thine anger, in what measure
thou thinkest fit: but so, as
nothing may remaine vnreconciled
to thee; so as my redemption
may not bee imperfect and
maimed: so as there may remaine
in man no fault to bee redeemed,
and in thee no anger to bee appeased.
O good Father! Charge
me freely (I say) with thy stripes,
set them so surely and seuerely as

thou wilt: but suffer not my sufferings
to bee vnfruitfull; doe
not double my griefe, by causing
me to lose the benefit of my grief.
For it would be a greater griefe
to mee that these sinners should
perish, then are all the torments
where with they teare mee: euen
as a louing mother sorroweth
more at the losse of her childe,
then she did at her trauailes for
his birth. By suffering and by
pardoning the redemption of the
world must bee wrought: and
therefore pardon them, O good
Father! For whom I suffer;
or else no redemption can follow.
And if the death which now I
suffer, if the life which now I

                  offer bee not sufficient, I will
suffer another death; I will offer
another life; I will doe anything,
O my good Father! wholly
to appease thee.
               BVt if thou wilt not bee absolutely
intreated, yet forgiue
them,His Pleading. I beseech thee, in regard
of their ignorance.And now brethren, I know that through ignorance yee did it, as did also your Rulers. For niether
this people, nor their Rulers
doe dir
                     •
                  ctly know, either who
I am, or what worke I haue in
hand. Whereby it followeth, that
they know not what they
doe.
                  Act. 3. 17. Blessed Father: thou
hast made mee wiser then
my enemies. For I know righ
                     •
                  
well what I am about to doe; b
                     ••
                  
thou hast not suffered the diue
                     •
                  
                  
perfectly to know it; much more
is this vnskilful multitude inuolued
in ignorance. And therefore
I am so farre from desiring reuenge,
that the more earnestly
they endeauour with many torments
to destroy mee; the more
earnest am I, both in praying and
pleading for their saluation. For
alas! they are ignorant; I pitie
them with my heart, and from
my heart desire thee to bee intreated
for them. Giue them
time and meanes to bee instructed;
open their vnderstanding
to know mee, and to know themselues:
but as the case now standeth,
forgiue them, I pray thee;
for they know not what
they doe.
               
               
                  
And further, seeing I am ioyfull
in receiuing these harmes,
wherefore art thou displeased
with those who doe them? Seeing
the party offended forgiue 
                     〈◊〉
                  
the wrong, at whose suit will thy
iustice prosecute? What hath
Iustice to doe when no man complaines?
Thou knowest right
well, that nothing can bee termed
an iniurie, which is not done
against our will. Seeing therefore
I willingly suffer, and that
in obedience to thy will and appointment,
to performe a most
necessary worke for the world:
remaine not thou displeased with
those, by whose hands my owne
will is performed, and this

great worke accomplished.
               BVT happily it may bee
said,Obiect. that as this action in it
selfe is the most heinous sin
that euer was committed;
so are these, in regard of
themselues, the most vnworthy
to be forgiuen.
               Be it so.Answ. But O holy Father! Do
I die only for small offenders? is
not my death sufficient for all?
Doe I die for any other end, but
that all offenders may bee forgiuen?
And wilt not thou regard
more my sufferings, then any
mans sinnes? more my charitie
in dying for my tormentors, then
their malice iu putting mee to
death? It is true indeed, that if

thou wilt punish them according
to their demerits, al the torments
of hell are nothing neere sufficient:
but therefore it is better
freely to forgiue them. For as
there was neuer sinne comparable
to this, so shalt thou neuer
haue the like occasion to manifest
thy mercy. O my Father! seeing
my blood is shed by thy will,
imploy the same to the best effect:
let not any man be depriud
of the benefit of that, which is
amply sufficient for all. And
fauour me also, O father! since I
needs must die, to make the best
aduantage of my death; to se
                     •
                  
my life so well as I can. And
therefore pardon those, I pray

thee, who torment me to death.
For the greater offenders thou
pardonest for my sake, the better
I shall thinke my life employed;
and it nothing auaileth that I
die for sinners, if thou deniest to
pardon sinners.
            
            
               MEDITATIONS
VPON THIS
Prayer.
               O PRECIOVS prayer!
fit onely to proceede
from our All-mercifull Redeemer:
who, as he taught
vs to loue our enemies, to
pray for them that curse vs;
so heere, by his example hee

confirmed the same. O
meeke SAVIOVR! what
inflamed charity did sparkle
in thy speeches? how
truely had the Iewes saide of
thee before: Neuer man spake,
as he speaketh? For let all the
prayers bee powred foorth
that euer were made, and
wee shall find none parallell
to this. Many haue prayed
for themselues, many for
their friends: but who euer
before in this sort prayed for
his enemies? Many haue
forgiuen offences after they
haue beene done; when the
paine is past, and the offender
happilie displeased at

what hee did: but whilest
the mischiefe is in action,
and before it bee accomplished;
in the very height of
madnesse and malice; to see
thee not onely forbeare to
hate thy enemies, but ardently
to loue them; to heare
prayers for them flowing
out of thy mouth, with
teares and groanes, whilest
thy blood was running out
of thy veines; to heare thee
plead for them, who wouldest
not open thy mouth to
speake for thy selfe. What
shall wee say? but that pity
and cruelty, iniury and mercy,
anger and patience, hate

and loue, did here meet and
contend together.
               O milde IESVS! O the
glory of my soule! what humane
iudgement? yea, what
vnderstanding of Angels is
able to apprehend, that thou
shouldest not only patiently
endure, but thus earnestly
pray for thy mortall enemies?
Thy smart, thy fainting,
the streames of blood
which freshly flowed from
thee, might haue put thee
in minde both of their malice
and of their iniustice:
and yet wert thou wholly
busied in procuring pardō,
both for that & for all their

other sinnes. O euerlasting
goodnesse! what a maruellous
example hast thou giuen,
both of patience and of
loue? Thou didst release
those who fastened thee;
plead for those who did accuse
thee; intreat for those
who did reuile thee; acquite
and discharge those, who are
in hand to kill thee: they
will not returne into the City,
before thou art dead; and
thou wilt not die vntill
thou hast obtayned their
pardon. O Redeemer of
soules! thou didst neuer either
doe iniury to any, or
blame any for doing iniurie

to thee: All thy actions and
words tended to teach vs
patience, pity, humility, gentlenesse,
and all other goodnesse.
Albeit thou haddest
many enemies in this world
yet didst thou neuer term:
any man enemy; all were esteemed
friendes, because
thou wert a true friend to
all.
               Thou hadst been formerly
presented before the high
Priest and Elders, before
Pilate, and before Herode;
in whose presence for the
most part thou wert silent:
but beeing presented
before thy Father on the

Crosse, thou didst first open
thy lippes to speake for thy
tormentors. O vnspeakable
charity! How inestimable
was thy loue towards
miserable man? When thou
wert accused before worldly
Iudges, thou wouldst not
spend one word for thy selfe;
but whē thou didst addresse
thy selfe to craue of thy Father,
wherefore doest thou
not intreat him, either to mitigate
or shorten thy paines?
Wherefore hast thou no pitie
vpon thy innocent flesh?
thy martyred members?
Wherefore seemest thou so
little to regard thy life? or

wherefore seemest thou to
neglect thy mournefull Mother?
thy dispersed Disciples
thy heauie followers and
friends? and disposest thy
selfe to pray for thy enemies.
Wherefore intreatest thou
without intreatie? Wherefore
crauest thou forgiuene
                     ••
                  
without either satisfaction
or submission for their offence?
               O sweete and onely Sauiour!
How fierie is the force
of thy Spirit? how hast thou
verified that which before
thou didst say; that thou
wert not sent but to the los
                     •
                  
sheepe of the house of Israel

what thou camest not to call
the righteous, but sinners to
repentance? All thy life
time thou diddest conuerse
with sinners, both by exhortation,
& by example to conuert
them to thee; & now at
thy death thou prayest for
them.The condition of Caluary changed. O Caluarie! how is
thy condition suddenly
changed? Before this time
thou wert a place where Iustice
was executed vpon infamous
offendors; but now
thou art consecrated for a
place of oblation and intercession
for them. It was not
meete that Oblation should
goe single without Intercession:
                  
and therefore, as our
great Priest made heere his
Oblation for sinne, so here also
did hee make Intercession
for sinners. And O you
stiffe necked Iewes! See how
our blessed Lord hath requited
your dealings. You turned
his house of prayer into
a denne of theeues; and hee
hath turned your denne of
theeues into a house of prayer.
Teaching you, as before
he had told,Iohn 4. that the houre
was then come, when neither at
your temple in Ierusalem, nor at
the mountaine in Samaria the
Father should bee worshipped;
but hee should bee worshipped

in spirit and trueth.
               
               O crucified IESVS!The great mercies of GOD. O
delight of my soule! What
shall wee say of thy exceeding
goodnesse? with greater
reason may wee now demand,
Where is thy ancient
wrath? then the Prophet
Dauid once demanded, Where
are thy ancient mercies? O my
soules safety! who can despaire
of thy goodnes? who
dares distrust it? Thou didst
pardō those who would not
be pardoned, & shall pardon
bee denied to those who ardently
desire it? Thou didst
pray for those who tormented
and blasphemed thee;

and wilt thou not pray for
those who pray vnto thee?
O blessed SAVIOVR!
when thou wert on the
Crosse all things forsooke
thee,The patience and loue of CHRIST. except onely thy patience
and thy loue. By thy
patience thou didst endure
all extremities of torments;
by thy loue thou didst offer
vp supplications with strong
cryings and teares. The
Iewes prouoked thy Father
to take vengeance vpon
them, in saying, His blood bee
vpon vs: but thou didst
pray him to remit that vengeance,
because thy blood
was shed for them. They

caried thee before the high
Priest, and before Pilate to
haue thee condemned; but
thou didst present them before
thy Father, that they
might bee pardoned. They
cried against thee, Let him be
crucified; but thou prayedst
for them, Father forgiue them.
Certainly, O my SAVIOVR!
It is so great a mysterie that
thou didst pray for those
who did blaspheme thee;
that thou didst pardon those
who tormented thee to
death, without sorow, without
intreatie; and that thy
prayer, Father forgiue them,
should preuaile against their

praier, His blood bee vpon vs;
that albeit wee must beleeue
it, yet we cānot cōprehend it.
               And thou,The true Mediator. O heauenlie
Father!Ezek. 22. seeke no more
for a man who should make vp
the breach, and stand in the gap
betweene thee and the Land.
Loe, this is he; this is the
true Mediatour betweene
thee and vs: raised between
heauen and earth, to reconcile
both together. And because
nothing can serue for
a fit meane to combine two
contraries, but that which
participates of the nature o
                     •
                  
both: Loe, this Mediatou
                     •
                  
participates of thy nature

being perfect GOD; and of
our nature, beeing perfect
man: and therefore is a fit
meane to ioyne, to fasten, to
vnite both together. A fit
meane, I say, vpon whom
man may discharge all his
sinnes, and GOD discharge
all his anger: who like a
strong and impregnable
wall, may keepe our sinnes
from approaching to GOD,
and GODS vengeance from
approaching to vs.
               BVT O my soule! do not
runne ouer this banquet
in haste; take a more exact
haste of euery dish; meditate

and ruminate vpon
these things as a cleane beast
cheweth the cud. Consider
first, the principall circumstances
of this prayer; then
exactly weigh euery worde
thereof.
            
            
               THE PRINCIPALL
CIRCVMSTANCES OF
This Prayer.
               WHo then was it that
thus did pray?Who prayed. The
sonne of GOD, who was
most worthy to bee heard.
To whom did he pray?To whom. To
GOD the Father, who was
most powerfull to grant.
For whom?For whom. not only for his

tormentors, not onely for
the people of the Iewes; but
for all sinners for whom hee
died; for all men whose sins
were the proper cause of his
death. Euē for those who little
regarded themselues; yea,
for many who thē were not,
he earnestly prayed: for vnlesse
CHRIST first prayeth
for sinners, they shall neuer
bee able to pray for themselues.
Where was it?Where. Vpon
the Altar of the Crosse.
When?When. In time of his extreame
torments, and of his
drawing neere to death.
How?How. His hands stretched
(like another Moses) to heauen;

and all his body imbrued
with blood.In what manner. In what
manner? O! in a most perfect
forme.Heb. 5. For the Apostle
saith, that he offred vp Prayers
& supplications with strong
cryings and teares. His Prayers
were many, formed in
manner of humble supplications;
with cryings, with valide
and strong cryings, and
with teares. And therfore the
matter of the prayer being
of great piety and merit, it is
no marueile that the Apostle
added, that he was heard.
               
               By this strong crying thou
must vnderstand,His strong crying. that with
a most forcible affection,

with deepe groanes, with a
violent intention of desire
and will, hee offered vp his
supplication to GOD. For
hee is saide to pray aloude,
whose soule is fired with feruent
deuotion and desire;
whose thoughts are neither
distracted nor remisse, but
both entirely and earnestlie
attentiue to the businesse in
hand. The cry of sins is exceeding
strōg, & yet the eare
perceiueth no noise; but the
feruent cry of deuotion is
much stronger, albeit no
voyce bee outwardly heard.
There is no strong crying to
GOD, but through aboundance

either of loue or of
griefe: both which were
most forcible in our SAVIOVR
vpon the Crosse.
Loue, for compasion towards
others; griefe, for the passion
which hee felt in himselfe.
He was enflamed to loue, by
his mysticall members; his
naturall members enforced
him to griefe. From this
loue and this griefe his crie
must needes bee exceeding
strong. And besides; it must
bee a violent voyce that was
heard for all men; that did
silence and drowne the clamour
of all sinnes. For it was
not for his tormentors only,

but it was for all men that
he then prayed: hee who died
for all, prayed for all.
               But O good IESV!His teares. O
the solace of my soule! who
could be worthy to stand so
neere thy Crosse, as to see
blood streame from thy
flesh, and teares from thy
eyes; to see thy blood mixed
with teares; to see, that, as
with sweat and blood thou
begannest thy passion; so
with teares and blood thou
diddest conclude it? What
adamant heart would not
breake? what leaden eyes
would not melt into teares?
what earthy spirit would

not be moued, as the whole
earth was? to see thy sacrifice
sprinkled, or rather imbrued
with blood, and thy prayers
watered with teares; to see
thy teares beautified with
blood, and thy blood washed
with teares? to see thee at
once to smite thy Fathers
cares with thy prayers, and
to mollifie his heart with thy
sighes and grones? O blessed
Redeemer! Albeit thou didst
pray to thy Father for the
greatest matter that euer was
demanded of him; yet if
thou hadst desired a greater,
thy blood was so abundant,
thy cries so strong, thy teares

so plentifull, and the loue
from whence they flowed
so ardent; that thy loue, thy
blood, thy teares and thy
cries must haue obtayned
it.
               O sinne!How offensiue sinne is. How offensiue
art thou to the heauenly Father?
how deepely dangerous
to the state of our
soules? seeing this expiation
was necessary to abolish
thee; seeing pardon for thee
could not be obtayned, but
by these cruell sufferings, by
these bloody teares of our
Reedemer. And thou (o my
soule) crie hideously when
thou praiest to the Lord, and

weepe abundantly for thy
sinnes: sigh, groane, teare
bloody teares from thy soule
when thou askest forgiuenesse;
seeing thy Sauior thus
cried and wept when hee
made intercession for thee.
For what reason or iustice is
it, that thy Sauiour crie and
weepe for thee, and not thou
for thy selfe?Attention in prayer. Or if thou canst
not weepe in thy prayers, yet
be earnest & attentiue, let not
thy thoughts be either scattered,
or heauy and dull: for if
thou be not attētiue to make
thy prayers, the Lord will
not bee attentiue to heare
them.Whose sinnes we must lament Learne also to lament,

not onely for thy
owne offences, but for the
sinnes and miseries of others;
euen as the Prophet
Hieremie lamented for the
calamity of his people when
he sayd:Oculi mei defecerunt prae lachrymis. 
                  My eyes faile and are
dimme with weeping. For albeit
true charity beginneth
alwayes at our selues, yet
must it extend vnto all: there
is no truer token of true charity,
then when it doeth extend
vnto all: not onely in
shewing compassion for
their miseries, but especially
in crauing pardon for their
sinnes. Ioy at the good
which happeneth to other

men, and greeue at their euill:
and so shalt thou make
profit of euery mans conuersation.
            
            
               OF THE SVBSTANCE
OF THIS
Prayer.
               BVT proceed, O my soule!
to the substance of this
praier, and obserue well euerie
word therof; for there
is not one word therein that
is not of weight.
            
            
               
               FATHER.
               FIRST he began with the
sweet word FATHER.
Hee did not terme him
LORD; for that was a name
of seuerity and iustice; but
FATHER, which is a name
of pity and mercy. If he had
sayd, LORD, forgiue them,
as Saint Stephen prayed afterward;
it might haue seemed
that hee had referred their
pardon to the curtesie and
iudgement of iustice. But
FATHER is a name of
compassion, a name of the
new Testament. A name
which by the blood and merits

of our IESVS, we may
challenge to vse towardes
hm. That, as he pleased
to bee our brother: so hee
would thereby make vs the
sonnes of his FATHER. And
therefore hee vsed the same
worde in praying for vs,
which hee did in praying
for himselfe: For as he prayed
for himselfe; Father into
thy hands I commit my spirit:
so he prayed for vs; Father
forgiue them. As if he should
haue said:
               O my Father! acknowledge
me now for thy Sonne, thy onely
Sonne, thy Sonne in whom thou
art well pleased, thy Sonne to

whom thou wilt denie nothing:
for as I am obedient to thee, as
to my Father; so I expect to bee
heard of thee, as thy Sonne.
Father, I am therefore come into
this world, that sinners also
should be receiued for thy sonnes;
and therefore heare mee now in
praying for them. If euer thou
wilt heare them praying to thee
in my Name, heare now my
owne prayer for them. So deare
a Sonne as I am to thee; so acceptable
let my prayer be to thee.
If thou hearest not the prayers of
thy Sonne, whose prayers then
wilt thou heare? If thou reiectest
my prayers, thou doest
more torment mee then doth the

Crosse. The Crosse I patiently
endure to abolish a greater euill:
that is, to appease thy wrath, and
to make sinners accepted for thy
sonnes. But fauour these torments
of thy Sonne, that they be
not endured in vaine. Fauour
thy Sonne, not to double his terments,
by denying him his charitable
request. Thou doest amply
reward the trauailes which any
man shall performe in thy seruice:
Now thy Sonne requireth
no recompense for himselfe: for
all my trauailes, for all my torments
in obedience to thy will,
I require no other recompense,
but that thou wilt grant my request
for miserable sinners.
            
            
               
               FORGIVE
               BY this word our Lord
discharged the office of
a Priest, in praying for the
sins of the people: for which
hee cryed, not onelie as a
Priest, but as a sacrifice;
which neuer demandeth
free forgiuenesse, but bringeth
satisfaction with it.
And not only he cried with
his mouth;With how many mouthes CHRIST craued forgiuenesse. but his wounds
cryed, his blood cryed, his
defilements cryed, his torments
cryed, al his members
cryed: Forgiue. So many
wounds as he receiued, so

many griefes as he endured;
so many mouthes hee opened,
with one voyce intreating.
               Accept these sufferings for
the sinnes of all men, for wee doe
pay thee whatsoeuer they owe.
Wee giue thee blood and smarte
for ransome, life for satisfaction,
body and soule for sacrifice:
Let there now bee mercy with
thee,
                  Psal. 130. for this is a plenteous
redemption. It is a hard
thing indeed which is demanded;
namely, that a most indulgent
Father should forgiue and
forget the cruell death of his only
Sonne, his entirely beloued
Sonne. But the sonne himselfe

demands it: he demands it with
his blood, with his wounds; with
all his sufferings he demands it.
               Not vnder any condition,Not conditionally but absolutely.
as hee prayed for himselfe in the
garden; If it be possible, If
thou wilt, If it may be: but
positiuely and absolutely he prayeth
thee to Forgiue. His owne
passion hee left to thy will; but
thy pardon hee doth absolutely
intreat. He put it to thy pleasure
whether hee should die or
no; but he leaueth no consultation,
no choice for thy granting of
forgiuenesse: his prayer for forgiuenesse
is so absolute, as it
may not be denied.
               Hereby thou mayest

learne (O my soule!) that
remission of sinnes, and all
diuine graces are to be desired
of GOD without condition;
because this prayer is
alwayes referred to the honour
of GOD. Also, that
whensoeuer thou forgiuest
thy enemies, thou doe it absolutely,
without reseruation.
Neuer accompt it a
Christian forgiuenes, when
it is with exception; that
thou wilt not speake to him,
that thou wilt not conuerse
& be familiar with him. For
thy SAVIOVR did not pray
for his enemies vpon condition,
or in part: hee prayed

absolutely for all, and for all
offences of euery one. GOD
also is so noble in pardoning,
that hee cannot forgiue one
sinne, either alone, or in part:
hee neuer pardoneth to
halfes; he cannot but either
wholly pardon, or wholly
punish: If any one sinne be
vnpardoned, the sinner must
be charged with all. O gentle
IESV! thou didst absolutely
pray for all sinners,
and therewith offer thy
blood, as a sufficient ransome
for all sinnes: For all
sinnes might bee numbred,
but thy precious blood
could not be valued.
               
                  
And it was not onely
absolutely,
                  Presently. that thou diddest
pray to thy Father, but also
that hee would presently forgiue:
thou wouldest not
giue day, it must bee foorthwith:
remission must bee
granted without intermission.
Thou wert then neere the
point of thy death: but thou
wouldest not die vntill pardon
was granted: thou
wouldest not make paiment
of all thy blood, vntill thou
hadst thy bargaine in hand;
vntill peace were composed
betweene GOD and Man.
Thou art not like many
worldly Parents, who leaue

small inheritances to their
children, intangled many
times with debts, suits, or other
incumbrances: but for
the heauenly inheritance
which thou hast giuen vs,
thou hast made ready payment,
cleared all reckonings,
remooued all difficulties and
charges, and concluded perfect
peace with thy Father
before thy death; saying vnto
him, FORGIVE! and
that presently, O my Father!
for euen now is the time arriued
to forgiue. This is the
houre of sacrifice, the day of satisfaction,
the day of remission,
I am euen now readie to lay

downe my life, and I make
now my last petition; my last suit
to thee shall bee this; FATHER
forgiue. O heauenly FATHER,
as thou louest thy Sonne, so
hold him no longer in torments;
for I must not die vntill thou
forgiue.
               Neither did hee pray to
the Father to forgiue the
sinnes only which then had
been committed,For all sinnes past, present, and to come. but simply
to forgiue; euen those sinnes
also which afterward should
be committed. For his persecuters
had not then satisfied
themselues with blasphemies
and scornes; they had
not then offered him a

spunge dipped in vineger;
they had not then opened
his side with a speare; they
had not then feasted their
eyes with sight of his dead
bodie: and yet he prayed as
well for these as for all the
cruelties which before they
had done: Yea, for all sinnes,
not onely past and present,
but to ensue, hee powred
foorth this prayer; Father
forgiue. Teaching vs thereby,
not onely readily to remit
all wrongs receiued, but
to stand resolued nothing
to regard whatsoeuer iniuries
shall afterwards bee offered;
and to make diligent

search, that no secret desire
of reuenge, doe secretly
rankle and fester in our
soules.
               But O meeke IESV!Wherefore he prayed to his Father to forgiue, and did not forgiue them himselfe, O
the hope of my soule! what
is the reason that thou doest
pray to thy Father to forgiue?
Hadst thou not power in
thy selfe to pardon sinnes?
Couldest not thou as easily
giue as aske? One word
from thy selfe might haue
serued the turne: wherefore
then didst thou intreate thy
Father to forgiue? O my
soules solace! was it to declare
thy selfe to bee a perfect
Priest, in furnishing thy

sacrifice with prayer? for a
Priest did offer, not onely
sacrifice, but prayer: hee
was not onely a sacrificer,
but an intercessour for the
people. Or was it to shew,
that thou madest greater
reckoning of the iniurie
done to thy Fathers glorie,
then of the violence vsed against
thine owne life? Or
lastly was it to manifest, that
thou wert so intentiue to the
redemption of the world,
that thou wert not offended
with any thing they did?
that thou tookest all in
good part? that thou didst
not esteeme them malefactors
                  
to thee, but benefactors to all
the world? regarding more
the good that the world was
redeemed, then the hurt that
thou didst die? As if in other
words thou hadst said.
FATHER, These men haue
broken thy Law, discredited thy
truth, violated thy Temple, blasphemed
thy Name; and therefore
thou art hee who must forgiue
them. I haue no cause to
forgiue, because I am nothing
grieued; I am well pleased with
my death; I esteeme my life well
bestowed; seeing by this meanes
the world is redeemed, and heauen
furnished with new glorious
guests.
               
               
                  
                  When losephs brethren feared
that hee would reuenge
their violence, hee sayd vnto
them: When ye thought euill against
me,Gen. vlt. GOD disposed it to
good; that hee might bring to
passe as it is this day, and saue
much people aliue. Feare not
therefore, I will nourish you and
your children. Much more
truely may our SAVIOVR
say to those who crucified
him▪
                   You entended much euill
against me; but loe, all is turned
to my glory, and to the good of
many. You thought by taking
away my life, to extinguish
my power: but loe, I
liue, and haue all power in heauen

and vpon earth. There
neuer was, nor can bee done a
more wicked act, then the taking
away of my life; and yet
neuer did so much good follow any
act; namely, the saluation
of much people aliue. And
now feare not my reuenge: I
haue prayed to the Father for
you, I haue obtained your pardon,
I haue obtained, not onelie
that you be not charged with the
euill, but that you may enioy the
benefit of my death.
               Which example if thou
wilt follow (O my soule)
If thou wilt regard more the
good then the euil which ensueth
euery action; if thou

wilt (which is a property of
GOD) draw good out of euill;
thou shalt neuer hate
any enemie, but rather loue
him for the good that hee
worketh. A great mans son
will wel endure to be taught
and reproued by his schoolmaster:
But there is no better
schoolemaster then an enemie;
who beareth an eie
ouer thy actions, and wilbe
nimble to reprooue thy
faults. If thou wouldest
liue warilie and in good order,
pray to GOD to send
thee an enemie, and thou
shalt need no schoolemaster;
hee will spare thee that stipend.

An enemie is the
bridle, a friend is the couer
of sinne. Friends puffe vs
vp; but enemies humble vs,
and make vs vigilant and
wise. Hee who hateth his
enemie, striketh one that is
sicke; killeth a dying man.
Triacle is made of poison.
Take the malice of thy enemie,
temper it with loue to
him, and with the works of
charitie towards him; and
thou makest an excellent
preseruatiue for thy soule.
            
            
               
               THEM.
               BVT O gracious Sauiour!
who were they for
whom thou diddest pray?
what them didst thou meane?
what them wouldest thou
haue forgiuen? were they
thy cruell crucifiers? wherefore
then diddest thou not
terme them bloodsuckers,
paricides, sacrilegious hangmen,
or whatsoeuer other
name either cruelty or impiety
could deserue? For two
especiall causes. One, to instruct
vs, that wee abstaine
from reprochfull speeches;

The other to declare, that he
esteemed no man to bee his
enemy. Vndoubtedly, the
Sonne of GOD did not accompt
his executioners for
his enemies, but for his
friends, for his brethren, for
his owne flesh and blood:
and therefore hee preached
vnto them during his life,
and at his death prayed for
them. They hated him indeed;
but in so doing, they
hated the most louing friend
they had in the world: one
who could not bee angrie
with thē, whose loue could
not be, either withdrawne,
or abated from working

their good. In case he disliked
any thing they did, it
was not in regard of himselfe,
but of his FATHER: and
therefore he prayed his FATHER
to forgiue them. He
who was nothing offended
with iniuries against himselfe,
as regardlesse both of
torment and scorne; was
most sensible of the iniuries
and despite which reached
to his FATHER: not to haue
them punished, but forgiuen.
               Also he vsed the generall
word them, not onely for
them, who were the present
actors of his death; but for

all them besides, who by their
sins gaue cause to his death.
And thou, O my soule, art
included in this prayer,
whose sinnes also are included
in the cause of his death.
Thou hast thy part in his
prayer, thy part in his remission:
especially if thou adioyne
thy prayer with his.
For if his prayer was profitable
to them, who neither
prayed with him, nor intreated
him to pray for them; it
will bee profitable for thee,
in case thou doest both. For
verily his prayer was profitable
to those who desired
no pardon, who did absolutely

refuse it. For how
could they desire to bee pardoned,
who would not acknowledge
that they did offend?
who cast all the blame
vpon IESVS? who held
him to haue deserued worse
then he suffered? Those excommunicate
Iewes were so
farre out of their wits, that
they did not onely forbeare
to aske pardon for their offence,
but repelled pardon
so much: as they could: being
not onely not sorrowfull
for the mischiefes they
did, but grieued because they
could doe no more. They
were not content to goe

without pardon, but they
demanded vengeance for
that which they did: His
blood be vpon vs, and vpon our
children.
               
               O sottish Synagogue!
wherefore doest thou desire
that the blood of CHRIST,
appointed to redeeme thee,
should bee turned to condemne
thee? O vnfortunate
Iewes! O cursed people! if
the Sonne of GOD had allowed
your demand. But
hee appealed from it, hee
would not consent to your
reprobate request: he would
in no case consent, that his
blood should be shed against

you, but for you. You called
vpon you the most cruell
curse that could bee; his
blood be vpon vs; but he encountred
it with his mercifull
prayer, Father forgiue
them. It hath beene often
seene that a man will not
hurt his enemy, that he will
pardon him if hee repent;
but who but IESVS did pardon
them, who would not
be pardoned, who despised
pardon? who would not
pardon him by whom they
were to be pardoned? who
would pardon Barrabbas, a
murtherer among them; but
not IESVS who came to saue
them?
               
                  
O infinite goodnesse▪
what wit is able either to
acknowledge, or apprehend
such exceeding loue?
Thou diddest cleanse those
who would be vnclean: thou
diddest set those at liberty,
who would be in restraint:
thou didst vnburthen those,
who would bee ouercharged:
thou didst saue those,
who would bee damned. O
my soules safetie! If thou
didst pardon those who desired
no pardon; wilt thou
not pardon him, who with
sorrow and teares entreateth
thy pardon? Thou didst
meet them who came to apprehend

thee; meet me then
O good IESV! who come
to intreat thee. Thou diddest
defend thy cruell tormentors,
who scorned thy
defence; who acknowledged
no fault: defend him, I
beesech thee, who flieth to
thy defence, who is much
displeased that euer hee did
offend. I am not yet amended,
I confesse: but it grieueth
me that I am not amended;
and with teares I entreat
thee that I may amend.
               
                  Create in mee a cleane heart,
and renew a right spirit within
me. O great GOD! the heart

which I brought from my
mothers wombe is so vncleane,
that I dare not offer
it to thee; it dares not appeare
in thy presence. It is
polluted with many foule
sins, it is loaden both with
delights and cares of this
world. But create in mee a
cleane heart, fit to receiue
thee; infuse into it a right spirit,
fit both to loue and to
praise thee. O gracious
GOD! giue mee a new spirit,
for mine is olde and vnpleasant:
giue mee a cleane heart,
for mine is impure: If thou
doest not this, if I bee not so
changed, no prayer of mine
shall euer be heard.
            
            
               
               FOR THEY KNOW
NOT WHAT THEY
doe.
               BVt O mighty Redeemer!
was it not sufficient, either
that thou didst pardon
their sinnes? or that thou
diddest both absolutely and
earnestly intreat thy Father
to pardon? but thou must
also plead their cause before
him? Oh! how great was
the worke of the Redemption
of the world? far greater
then was the worke of creation.
The reason is plaine:
Because there is not so great

a distance betweene nothing
and nature, as betweene sinne
and grace. For as grace is
exceedingly aboue nature, so
is sinne exceedingly beneath
nothing. Nothing giues no
offence: but sinne offendeth
infinitely. And therefore
GOD produced all things out
of nothing, only by his word:
but to reduce sinners to
grace, all these great actions
were required. To teach
vs thereby, no lesse to abhor
sinne, then we would abhor
thus cruelly to intreate our
SAVIOVR; thus carelesly
to put him to all these performances
againe.
               
                  
O fountaine of Loue! Albeit,Our Sauiour would not bee
                  all power is giuen thee
both in heauen and vpon earth;
ye twouldest not thou heere
susteine the office of a Iudge.
Albeit,A iudge. these intolerable
both iniuries and indignities
were heaped vpon thee, yet
wouldest not thou beare the
part of an accuser:An accuser. but thou
wouldest bee a Mediatour.But a Mediatour. Two offices of a Mediatour.
Now, to a Mediatour two
offices do properly pertaine:
either to present supplication,
or to make some defence.
The one our SAVIOVR did,
in saying; Father forgiue
them; the other, when he added;
for they know not what they

doe. By the first hee was
an Intercessour; by the second
a Patron or Aduocate;
by both a most perfect Mediatour.
The Iewes before
had sought after many accusations
against IESVS, but
could find none: and now
innocent IESVS seeketh how
to excuse them.Noe defence for the lewes but ignorance. And verily
this sinne was of so high
quality and nature, that besides
ignorance, nothing
could bee brought, either
for excuse or for extenuation
thereof.The grossenesse of their ignorance. And yet it seemed
that their ignorance
was not onely grosse and supine,
but voluntarily affected:

euen as if a man should
willingly couer his eyes, because
hee will not see who it
is, whom hee intendeth to
smite or kill. But assuredly
they knew not, either what
good they did to CHRIST,
or what euill to themselues.
They knew well enough
what euil they did; but they
knew not what euil they did
thereby deserue.
               But where art thou?Ignorance cannot be alleadged for vs. O
my soule! In what estate esteemest
thou thy selfe,
whensoeuer thou doest voluntarily
aduenture to sin?
what shall thy SAVIOVR
say for thy excuse? For it

seemeth that thou art in
worse case, then were the
Iewes who tormented him
to death. For ignorance
was alleaged for them; but
that cannot possibly be pleaded
for thee, because hee is
more clearly reuealed to thee
then he was to them. Thou
knowest right well, both
what thou doest, and what
is to ensue.Yet some defences may. But O saluation
of soules! If in the sharpest
sence of thy torments, thou
didst extenuate thy tormentors
sinnes, wilt thou not
now in thy seat of glory, alleadge
something to thy Father
for those, who with

faith and with griefe implore
thy defence? It is true
indeed, that ignorance cannot
bee pretended for mee.
But hast thou but one blessing,
                  Gen. 27.
                  O my SAVIOVR! hast
thou but one defence for all
sinners? Defend mee, euen
me also, O my SAVIOVR!
say I was weake, or inconsiderate,
or suddenly surprised.
Say what thou wilt,
O my SAVIOVR! so I be not
banished from thy defence.
And yet in very trueth it
may be said,All sinners are ignorant. that all sinners
are blind, that they know not
what they doe. For if they
knew, with what impietie

they violate the goodnesse,
and dis-esteeme the iudgements
of GOD; with what
defilements they deforme
the beauty of their soule;
what losse they incurre of eternall
glory; what penalty
of eternall torments awaiteth
for them: they would
rather aduenture vpon a
thousand deathes, then vpon
one sordide and slauish
sinne.
               O incomprehensible loue!The loue of CHRIST.
Thy members (O my SAVIOVR)
were racked on the
Crosse: thy ioynts opened,
thy nerues crackt, thy hands
and thy feet were painefully

nailed; on euery side thou
wert assailed with blasphemies
and scornes; all which
thou didst beare off with thy
loue. Thy loue did not
permit thee either to complaine,
or to be angry; thy
loue made thee sencelesse of
griefe; thy loue made thee
forgetfull of thy selfe, and
mindfull of nothing but of
mercy for thy enemies; and
to appease thy Fathers
wrath against them. O louing
IESV! what charitie
burned in thy diuine breast?
that almost at the instant of
thy death, thou wert more
regardfull of thy enemies,

then either of thy selfe, or of
any thy friendes. For thy
mother and some other thy
friends stood sorrowing and
weeping neere the Crosse;
thy enemies did most bitterly
blaspheme; and doubtfull
it is, whether the heauinesse
of the one, or the
malice of the other did most
exceed: and yet thou wert
not so intentiue to comfort
the first, as to prodcure pardon
for the last.
               Assuredly,It is not CHRISTS will that wee forbeare to weepe. O my soule!
it is not our Lords minde
to drie vp thy teares, to asswage
the sorrow which
thou shouldest expresse, in

regard of his sufferings. It
pleaseth him well, that his
friendes should freely spend
teares for his torments; but
he cannot endure, that sins
by his torments should not
be pardoned. As hee died
for pardon of sinnes, so was
hee most carefull to vse all
meanes, to obtaine the same.
He came not into the world
to drie mens eyes from weeping,
but to saue mens soules
from perishing: as this was
his principall worke, so his
principall words were directed
to this end.
               O bottomlesse depth of
charity and goodnesse! neuer

exceeded, neuer equalled.
Verily, O good IESV!
as thou saidest at thy last
Supper, I giue you a new commandement:
so mightest thou
haue said vpon the Crosse;
I giue you a new example;
                  A new example. not
onely to pardon, but to
pray for our enemies; and
in the best manner that you
can to excuse them. And that
at the very instant of offence,
before it be fully accomplished:
before either intreaty,
or time, hath either worne
out, or any deale abated
our griefe. For whilest
their malice was hottest in
action, whilest with many

cruelties they tormented thy
body, whilest with high
blasts of blasphemy they vexed
thy soule, thou, as if thou
hadst beene. depriued, both
of sence in thy selfe, and respect
towardes thy friendes,
didst wholly bend thy selfe
to obtaine their pardon. Thy
griefe was greater without
comparison, that thy enemies
should perish, then
that thy friends did lament;
or that thy selfe didst endure
a most sharpe and shamefull
death.
               Verily,Prophesies fulfilled. O meeke IESV!
now was that verified which
had beene prophesied of

thee long before:Isa. 53. 
                  He made
intercession for the transgressors.
And againe:Psal, 109. 
                  For the loue that
I had vnto them, loe, they take
against mee; but I giue my selfe
to prayer.
                  The charity of CHRIST For thy charitie
was so great, that it would
not suffer thee to complaine
of thy torments: Yea, it
enforced thee to pray for
thy tormentors; yea, to excuse
them. Euen as a man
will easily, not only pardon,
but excuse him; by whom
he is cut, lanced, seared, or
otherwise grieued; either
for preuenting or curing
some dangerous disease. As
before thou hadst taught vs

to loue our enemies; so here
thou diddest giue example,
how farre wee should loue
them:How far to loue our enemies. euen to pray earnestly
for them; to bee sorry for
their offences, and rather
to qualifie and couer, then
either to aggrauate or display
them. Hee that thus
loueth not his enemy, doth
not beare true loue towards
thee.
               For the loue of GOD is so
ioyned with the loue of our
neighbour,The loue of GOD ioyned with the loue of our neighbour. that they cannot
be separate. They both
spring from the same roote;
they both flow from the
same fountaine; they are, as

it were, twisted into one
threed: insomuch as with
the same habituall loue
where with wee loue GOD,
we loue also our neighbour.
As all the lines of a spheare
which touch the Centre,
touch also one another; so
whosoeuer loueth GOD, loueth
also his neighbour: &
thou canst not separate from
thy neighbour, vnlesse thou
also separate from GOD. The
Commaundement to loue,
                  Not so hard to loue, as to hate.
seemeth to be no hard Commandement
because it is to
doe that whereto we are inclineable
by nature. If GOD
had commanded vs to hate

our neighbour; it seemeth to
haue bin more hard; because
it is more agreeable to our
nature, to loue, then to hate.
Albeit thy neighbor be troublesome
and hard;A troublesome neighbour must be loued, yet loue
him not the lesse. If it bee
hard to loue thy neighbour,
it is more hard to bee hated
of GOD.
            
            
               THE FATHERS
ANSVVERE.
               NOW, albeit the FATHER
did not foorthwith answere
the Sonne in an audible
voyce; albeit a voice did
not sound from heauen, at

the death of IESVS, as it did
at his baptisme:Matth. 3. 
                  This is my
beloued Sonne, in whom I am
well pleased: yet, as the Apostle
said,Heb. 5. that his prayer
was well heard; so there is no
doubt, but it was effectually
answered. For as IESVS
prayed much more then hee
was heard to pray; so was
his prayer answered, when
no answere was heard. But
GOD doth not alwayes answere
prayers by words,How GOD often answereth. but
for the most part by effects.
When the Father denied his
Sonnes prayer in the garden,
he answered by an Angel
in words; but when he

granted his prayer vpon the
Crosse, hee answered not by
wordes, but by effectuall
workings; which is a most
powerfull answere.The effectuall answere of the Father. First,
therefore by vertue of this
prayer, one of the theeues
crucified with him, conuerted
to him; and desired to
be remembred by him. Then
the Centurion, who was appointed
to guard him, did openly
confesse him to be the
Sonne of GOD: and others
also, who stood by, smote
their breasts (their hearts being
smote before) and returned
into the city. Afterwards
at the Feast of Pentecost, three

thousand were conuerted at
one Sermon, and fiue thousand
at another. Also by
merit and power of this
prayer, Saint Stephen was
called; Saint Paul conuerred;
Saint Matthew elected; and
generally, all our prayers are
heard, all our sinnes remitted,
in case we repent. Wherfore
conceiue, O my soule!
that GOD the Father answered
his Sonne, not by externall
voyce, but by tacite and
internall consent; in maner
as followeth.
               O My Sonne! I see thy sufferings,
and I see the loue

wherewith thou sufferest. The
loue wherewith thou so imbracest
thy paines, that it will not
suffer thee to bee angry for thy
paines: the loue whereby thou
art, both ready and desirous, to
suffer more paines then thou doest.
Loe now, I accept thy sacrifice,
burning in the bright
flames of thy loue: loe, thy teares,
groanes, sighes and cryes, haue
preuailed with me, and obtained
thy desire. Loe, my Sonne, I
grant thy petition, I heere lay
downe my wrath; I shut the
floodgates of my fury, and open
the fountaines of mercy to all. I
offer grace, iustice, remission of
sinnes, adoption to bee children;

aswell to those who thus rage against
thee, as to all other sinners,
in all ages, and of all countreys;
whensoeuer they haue
beene, or shall be, or wheresoeuer
they are, or howsoeuer they
haue offended. All this, my son,
I freely grant by the merits of
thy passion; but so, as they reiect
not this mercy offered; so, as they
but open their armes to embrace
it:GOD doth not absolutely compell. But I will compell no man against
his will. For, as when
thou diddest open the eyes of the
blinde, it was their owne eyes
whereby they did see: so when
the will of sinners is both enlightned
and enabled by grace, their
proper will must then fall to

worke. And therefore let all
sinners but resort vnto me; let
them with humility in themselues,
and faith in thee, sue forth
their pardon; let them take out
this my grant vnder seale of the
Sacraments; and we will bee all
friends: they shall be my sonnes,
and thy fellow heires in my kingdome
of Heauen.
            
            
               MEDITATIONS
vpon the same.
               O HOLY FATHER!
how great are thy mercies
towards miserable sinners?
giue me thy grace both
by vnderstanding to know,

and by loue to admire them.
How much more forcible
was this prayer of thy sonne
vpon the Crosse for sinners,Christs prayer more powerfull for sinners, then for himselfe.
then was his prayer in the
garden for himselfe? When
hee prayed in the garden,
prostrate on the ground, bathed
in a bloody sweate,
thrice for himselfe, thou
wouldest not heare him: but
when hee prayed on the
Crosse for his mortall enemies,
thou diddest grant his
prayer at the very first word.
O infinite goodnesse! that
had more pity on the miseries
of sinners, then on the
flesh of thy only sonne And

because to thy diuine eie nothing
is past, nothing to
come,All things present to GOD. but all things are present;
because with thee there
is neither yesterday nor to
morrow; because thou neither
foreseest things to come,
nor remembrest things past,
but beholdest all things with
one act of thy diuine knowledge:
because things which
are not only far off in regard
of vs, but happily are not,
are present to thee: it followeth,
that thy sweet sonne
still hangeth crucified before
thee betweene heauen and
earth;Christ still crucified. still bleedeth and praieth
for sinners; Father forgiue

them. Forgiue thou, I pray
thee, by vertue of this prayer,
the sinnes of thy suppliant:
which alas! I haue almost
forgotten, but are all
present before thee, and cry
to thee for iustice. For if
this powerfull prayer was
heard for his professed and
malicious enemies, who neither
desired nor regarded
his prayer; shall it not bee
heard for those who ioyne
with him, both in prayer
for forgiuenes, and in teares,
to extinguish thy anger against
them? Heauenly Father!
I haue nothing of my
owne which thou canst accept:

but I heere present to
thee,An oblation. the merits and obedience
of thy only Sonne; all
the labors and griefes which
in this world hee endured
for sinners. For this is our
stocke, this is our treasure,
this is the inheritance which
he hath giuen vs, and wherof
he hath made vs heires by
his last will and testament:
and this is rightly ours. Because
it is no lesse ours which
is freely giuen vs, then that
which wee purchase by our
owne endeauours.
               And,No want if we haue Christ. O blessed SAVIOVR!
what can I want if I
haue thee? If I haue thee,

I haue my part in thy prayers,
in thy teares, in thy
blood, in thy death, in all
the merits of thy sufferings,
and shall haue my part in
thy glory. Thou didst not
only pray for sinners on the
Crosse, but continually praiest
to thy Father for them;
that hee will vouchsafe to
forgiue thē, to impute their
offences to thee, and to impute
thy righteousnesse to
them.A prayer. O bowels of mercy!
cease not, I beseech thee, often
to repeat this paryer to
thy Father for mee; Father
forgiue him. For because by
sinning I often become thy

enemie, I often crucifie thee:
what should become of me,
if thou shouldest not often
pray to thy Father to forgiue
me? And therefore, O
my sure Saluation! so often as
either by my owne infirmity,
or potency of my enemies,
I slippe into sinne, so
often say to thy Father for
me, Father forgiue this sinner:
Father, for my sake bee not displeased
with him.
                  The greater our offences are, the greater is GODS glory in pardoning. And wherefore. And the
greater my offences shall be,
the greater shall be thy glory
in procuring my pardon.
               For because of all attributes
to GOD, goodnesse,
after our manner of vnderstanding,

is the most excellent;
and that wherein hee
glorieth most, and that for
which hee is most praysed
both in heauen and vpon
earth; it followeth, that the
more goodnesse hee expresseth
in any action, the more
glory he acquireth thereby.
And therefore as generally
GOD hath not manifested
so great goodnesse in anie
worke, not in all, as in the
worke of our Redemption;
wherein he both did and suffred
so many things to make
vs good: as thereby in generall,
the passion of our
SAVIOVR, is so farre from

being ignominious, that all
the workes of GOD layd
together, doe not beget to
him so great glory: so in
particular, the greater the
sinnes are that thereby are
remitted; as they manifest
the greater goodnesse, so the
glory which they rayse must
be the greater.
            
            
               
               IN WHOSE
Presence this Prayer
was made.
               ALL this was done in the
presence of his blessed
Mother, and of diuers of his
dearest friends: As calling
them to be witnesses of this
Generall pardon; as calling
them to be witnesses, that as
all were redeemed, so all
might bee pardoned by his
death. Teaching them also,
first, to forgiue iniuries done
personallie to themselues;
secondly, that albeit they

were permitted to weepe
for his death, yet they were
not licenced either to seeke,
or to desire reuenge, Lastly,
to enioyne them to ioyne with
him in this charitable prayer;
Father forgiue them, for
they know not what they doe.
Our SAVIOVR would not
lay downe his life, vntill he
had made a most perfect
knot of amity and peace;A perfect peace-maker
vntill he had reconciled man
with GOD; vntill he had reconciled
his enemies with
his friends. For in that he intreated
his Father to forgiue,
he commanded his friendes
neuer to accuse. For what

iustice could bee required against
those who were pardoned?
How should man
be offended, when GOD is
appeased? As he left them a
passion to weepe, so did hee
enioyne them a compassion to
forgiue.
               O most happy and holyday!
                  A great holy day.
wherein the sonne praied,
the Father pardoned, and
men were reconciled. And
this was the peace, O great
Redeemer! which was sweetly
published by heauenly
voices (as by thy herehaults)
at the time of thy birth.Luk. 2. 14. 
                  On
earth peace, good will among
men. This was the gift

which in thy last Sermon,
thou didst leaue to thy Disciples:
Peace I giue vnto you.
                  Ioh. 12. 27.
And thus at thy death in
praying for thy enemies,
thou didst seeme in this sort
to speake to thy friends.
               LOe,The great peace of the world concluded. my friends, I am now
concluding the great peace of
the world. I haue reconciled
you to my Father; I haue vnited
you to my selfe; and doe
enioyne you to bee at amity with
all men. As I die in loue with
all men, so must all hate extinguish
by my death, among those
that are mine. Alasse! what
should beco0me of you and all

mankinde, If I should now die
in displeasure or discontent? Assuredly,
you should not then
be reconciled to my Father; you
should not then bee vnited with
me. And verily so often you fall
from this reconcilement, so often,
you breake this vnion, as you be
at enmity with you brother.
When you are at mutuall contention
your enemy the diuell in like
fashion looketh on,How the Diuell eyeth contentious persons. as an Eagle
eyeth a Cock fighting or a Wolf
the rude encountering of Rams:
intending to make you all his
prey. In case you fall into hatred
together, you thereby strike
into variance with me.
               O blessed Peace. Maker!

who shall dare to take reuenge
of light iniuries, seeing
thou didst pray for those
who tormented thee to
death? Seeing thou madest
no reckoning of the nailes
which pierced thy handes
and thy feete, shall I make
account of an angry or disgracefull
word? How shall
I desperately dare to esteeme
any man my enemy, seeing
thou wouldest bee a friend
and brother to all? Verily,
thus much may any man
borrow of his owne weakest
reason;By hating others, wee loose GODS loue. that by hating
others, I loose thy loue; because
I hate those whom

thou louest, and for whom
thou ceasest not to pray.A short Prayer. O
my soules health! Leaue me
not, I beseech thee, either
out of thy prayer, or out of
the reconcilement which
thou hast made: seeing I can
haue no benefit by the one,
but I must bee included in
the other. And seeing the
sinnes wherof I desire to bee
pardoned, are infinitelie
hatefull to thy Father; let
me not esteeme the iniuries
intolerable, which any man
shall doe vnto me; let me be
no lesse vnwilling to reuenge
the one, then I would be to
bee punished for the other.

Yea, let me be no lesse carefull
to pray for the offences
of others against my selfe,
then I would bee to intreate
pardon for my offences against
thee.

Thankesgiuing, Payer
and oblation.
               I Adore, laud, and glorifie

CHRIST! I blesse thee and
giue thee thankes, O Sonne
of the liuing GOD! for that
thou wouldest not onelie
permit, but submit thy sacred

members, to be thus cruelly
both tormented and deformed
for mee. And now I
lowly blesse and salute them
all, for the loue and honour
which I am bound, both to
beare and to expresse towardes
thee for this benefit.
I salute and kisse thy blessed
feete; which had trauailed
many iourneys, and at last
waded to death for mee in
thy blood: leauing markes
behinde them, in what footstepps
I should treade, I salute
thy knees, which were
often bowed to the earth in
prayer, and often wearied
with trauaile for mee. I salute

thy blessed breast; inwardly
inflamed with loue,
and outwardlie deformed
with knotty scourges. Haile
sacred side which was opened;
gentle and sweet heart
which was pierced for mee
with a speare. Haile battered
backe of my Redeemer,
plowed and furrowed
with grieuous lashes. Haile
holy armes, spread at the
largest length to embrace all
sinners; and most bountiful
hands in distributing the
treasure of thy blood among
them. I salute thy glorious
countenance defiled with
spittings; which thou hadst

neither lust nor leisure to
wipe away. I salute thy mellifluous
mouth, and all thy
instrumēts of speech; which
could not bee stopped by a
spunge filled with vineger,
or by any othermeanes from
praying for mee. And you
gentle eares, filled for my
sake with blasphemies and
reproaches; you amiable
eyes, which for mee haue
powred forth many showers
of teares, I reuerently salute
you. I salute thy royall
head, most cruelly goared
and gashed with thornes; to
adorne me with the crowne
of glory. Most meeke IESVS!

I salute thy whole body,
which was scorned,
scourged, crucified; which
died and was buried for my
saluation. Haile rosie woūds,
and most precious bloode,
which was offered to thy
Father for me. Haile most
noble soule of my SAVIOVR,
which was vilely vexed
and crucified to death, to
procure for mee eternall life.
I confesse, O louing LORD!
that since I was brought
forth into this sinful world, I
haue brought forth a world
of sin. Therefore I beseech
thee by the sufferings of thy
most sacred members, to

clense all my members from
the corruptions wherewith
I haue clogged them; and to
sanctifie them with the merits
of thy passion. I beseech
thee (O LORD) fauourably
to forgiue mee what I haue
done; and liberally to giue
mee what I could not deserue.
               AND O most mercifull
FATHER! most mighty
creator of heauen and of
earth! albeit I am of all sinners
the most vnworthy; yet
doe I offer to thee the most
precious death of thy onely
sonne, for all the sinnes that

I haue done, and for all the
benefits that I desire. Behold,
O most pitifull Father, what
impieties were dealt vpon
thy most pious sonne for my
sake. Behold the torne coat
of thy son Ioseph, dropping
with blood; and see if thou
knowlest it to bee his garment.
Verily he is fallen into
the power of some wicked
beast, which thus hath
torne it, and trampled it in
his blood; and altogether
deformed it with the filth of
our sinnes. O distributer of
grace! cast the eies of thy
maiestie vpon the vnspeakable
worke of thy mercy: behold,

I pray thee, who it is
that thus hath suffered; and
fauourably regard him for
whom he hath suffered.
               Behold, O glorious FATHER!
the members of thy
sweet childe, cruelly racked
vpon the crosse; and fauourably
regard what my substance
is. See his bleeding
hands nayled to the crosse,
and bee pleased to remit the
bloody sinnes which my
hands haue committed. See
his naked side pierced with
a speare, and renue me with
the blessed fountaine which
flowed out of that wound.
See his vnspotted feet struck

through with rough and rigid
nayles; and enable mee
by the fastning of them to
the Crosse, to run constantly
the way of thy commandements.
               Obserue, O eternal Father!
thy deare Sonne, in the fairest
flourish of his age; how
his necke bowed, his head
declined; how his whole
countenance was deformed.
Behold, how his starry eies
are sunke and set in his head;
how his nose growth sharp,
his lippes pale, his eiebrowes
hard, his cheekes shrunke
and wane: behold his breast
swolne, his side bloody, his

bowels drie, his armes and
legges stiffe: Beholde his
whole body resolued into
death. Behold my Priest,
who need not bee sprinkled
or sanctified with other
blood, but gloriously glistereth
in his owne. Behold,
my pleasing and perfect sacrifice;
odoriferous and acceptable
to thee. Behold my
Aduocate whome I haue directed
to plead my cause before
thee. Heare him, I
pray thee, and regard the defence
that hourely hee maketh
for me. Grant, O pitifull
FATHER! that I may
alwayes haue him for my

                  Aduocate, whom by no merit
of mine, but by thy pure
grace thou hast giuen for
my Redeemer.
               O omnipotent FATHER of
my LORD! what I could find
most precious, most highly
to bee esteemed, I haue deuoutly
presented to thee:
Compose thy selfe now, to dispose
thy grace and mercy towardes
mee. And albeit I
am vnworthy of thy rich fauours,
in regard of my merits;
yet remember thy mercies,
remember thy promises,
remember the inestimable
merits of my Redeemer:

remember what hee hath
done, and what he hath suffered,
euen from his Cratch
to his Crosse; not for himselfe,
but for me. All which
I heere offer to thee, most
gentle FATHER! as a sacrifice
for my sinnes, and
for all my necessities:
for whatsoeuer I require of
thee, it is in his name, and
for his sake; it is for the loue
thou bearest to him, and for
the loue that hee beareth to
thee.
               Thou hast promised to
honour fathers in their sons,
and sonnes for their fathers.

O fauourable LORD! honor
now thy onely Sonne, by
doing good to moe, for the
loue thou bearest to him.
For he is my FATHER, my
second Adam; and I am his
sonne, albeit vndutifull; yet
because, in trueth, I am his
sonne; for the loue thou bearest
to him, be fauourable to
mee. For assuredly, he hath
payd for mee much more
then I owe. No offence can
bee so grieuous, for which
his sorrowes, his sufferings,
his obedience, and aboue all
his profuse loue, hath not
amply satisfied: which his

large riuers of blood cannot
wash away; which may not
bee drowned and deuoured
in his death.
               O heauenly FATHER!
there is nothing in my selfe,
which I dare presume to
present vnto thee. For what
can proceed from this carion,
which is not noisome?
what fruit canst thou expect
from this earth, which thou
hast cursed from the beginning,
but thornes and briers?
And therfore I offer this my
SAVIOVR and Redeemer,
thy most blessed Son;
and the vnmeasurable loue

whereby thou didst send
him into the world, apparelled
with my flesh, to free
mee thereby from eternall
death. Beseeching thee, to
accept his humble and feruent
prayers, for my dry and
dull deuotions. Accept his
teares, for the torrent of
teares which I should powre
foorth; but by reason of the
hardnesse of my heart, I cannot.
Accept his incomprehensible
dolours and torments,
which thou onelie
perfectly knowest; for the
sorrow & contritiō which I
am bound to performe. Lastly,

accept his sharpe and penurious
life, with all his trauailes
and exercises of vertue;
accept his cruell death,
and all his passions, as a sacrifice
to thy glorious Maiesty;
for all the euill workes
which I haue done, and for
all the good workes which I
should haue done.
               Feede mee with his flesh,
inebriate me with his blood:
let his griefe enter into my
soule, that I may bee resolued
wholly into his loue.
Away all forraine loues; away
with the multitude of
worldly phantasies and

dreames: let me be crucified
with him to the world; let
me so die with him, that my
life may bee layde vp in thy
diuine treasury. Thy Apostle
compareth all worldlie
things to dung: and may bee
likened to the swallowes
dung,Phil. 3. which fell vpon the
eyes of Tobias, and made him
blinde. For we cannot see
spirituall things, so long as
our eyes are daubed with
this dung.
                  Diuites eguerunt, & 
                  The rich haue wanted,
and suffer hunger;
                  Psal. 34. 
                  but they
who feare the LORD want
no good thing. The things
of this world doe not fill▪
                  
but inflate; euen as the Prophet
sayd of Ephraim:
                  Hos. 12. 
                  Hee
feedeth on winde. They are
like sharpe liquors, which
doe not satisfie, but prouoke
hunger. They are like salt
water, to quench thirst; or
oyle to extinguish fire.
               O my life! O desire of
my soule! hide mee from
the world; obscure me from
the fawning fauours thereof,
and take me into the secret
retreits of thy bosome
to dwel. One thing is necessary;
and that doe I desire. My
beloued is one.
                  Cant. 6. My CHRIST
IESVS, my GOD, my spouse

is one, and my only loue. O
heauenly FATHER! let
nothing be sweet, nothing
sauourie vnto mee; let nothing
affect mee, but onely
IESVS CHRIST. Let
him bee wholly mine, and I
wholly his.
                  Cant. 6. Let mee neither
loue, nor know any thing
but him, and him crucified.
To whom with thee and the
holy Ghost be all honor
and prayse for euer.
Amen.
               
               
                  
Praise, and Glory, and
Wisedome, & Strength,
Dominion, Riches and
Power, bee vnto our
GOD, for euermore,
Amen.
               
            
            FINIS.
