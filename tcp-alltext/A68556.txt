                  AFTER THAT I HAD
(worſhipfull Sir) taken
ſome payne, in collectynge
certayne hydden
Secretes together, & reduced them
into one libel, or Pamphlet (for my

to publiſh the ſame, and conſidered
wich my ſelfe the ſaying of ye wiſe:
which is. That good is beſt, which to
all indifferētly, is of like goodnes, or effect:
or which without reſpect of perſon, is good
to all indifferently. The conſideration

of which, and her importunacie togethers
inſtiged me to cōmunicate
vnto the view & publique benefite
of all men, this lytell Booke: The
coments wherof, doth inſtruct and
teach all maner of perſones & Degrees
to know perfectly, the maner
to make diuers & ſundrie ſortes of

of ſweete and pleaſant Waters,

and Vertues: With diuers other
things that haue not hitherto ben
publiquely knowen: which fact of
myne (I know) wyll be, not onelye
deſſyked of ſome, but altogether cō
               dempned:
Not for that it is euyll,
but that their fine heades can not
diſgeſt, that any other beſide them
ſelues ſhuld enioy the benefit therof,
hauing for their MAXIME, that
ſuch thynges, are of ſmall price, as
are common to al men: much after

A VICENE, GALENE, or HIPOCRATES,
or any others ſuche lyke, hath
often tymes cured the Deſeuſes in
ſundrie and many Perſones, for
that the ſame hath ben commonly
vſed: but rather moſte wyllynglye
and courteouſlye to imbrace the
