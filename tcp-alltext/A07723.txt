               CHAP. I
               
                  WHen Spaine was nurſed with the milke of paganiſme, vertue not knowne; nor God honoured, there liued a people ſo ripe in ſin, that the kéene edge of ſhames ſickle, lay euen ready whetted to reape them downe for confuſions harueſt: yet the ſubiects then liuing where not ſo wicked as the King vitious: a King we name him, (if illuſtrious title of maieſtie, may grace ſo pernitious a foe to nature with ſo royall a ſtile) his birth was fatall, for when the midwife pulled him from the cradle of his conception, the earthquake, and heauen rained blood: his parents ominous, the one deuoured by wolues, the other burnt to death by thunder: his youth full vnlucky chances, his age tirannous and miſchieuous, and all his life ſubiect to blacke miſdéedes. When his parets by heauens wrath had ended thus their, dates, he raigned King, and wore the imperiall Diademe, but ſuch a King, good men thought neuer ſprong from womans wombe. Morindos for ſo we name him, being ſeated vpon the throane of maieſtie, ruled not in loue but by force, making his nobles flaues to his ſinne, and their

wiues, feeders of his luſt: for every day in the yeare hee had a ſeuerall concubine, all young, beawtifull, and louely: nature framed their bodies faire, though ſinne made their ſoules blacke: for both art and riches indeuored to delight his inſatiate deſires: earths chiefeſt pleaſures were at his command: and all the lullabies of content, rockt him in the cradle of ſecuritie: thus careles of heauens wrath, he more honoured the Deuill, then he loued God: and what was the vileſt to nature, he moſt doted vppon. But now after al theſe pleaſures of his wanton youth, the kind imbraces of his fayre concubines, which like earthly Angells made him happy in natures ſports, he wickedly fell inamored vppon one of the Deuills blacke ſaints, one Madam Miracola, a Witch of damnation, now burning in heli for her blacke deedes: this Madam Miracola borne of noble parentage, brought vp in the deepeſt artes, skilfull in Magick charmes, and incantations, who hauing ſpent ſeauen yeres in that déepe miſtery of coniuration, ſildome ſleeping without the ſoſciety of ſpirrits, fayries, goblins, or nigtly ſhapes: hir chiefeſt ſtudie and ayme was at principallitie, to rule ſole Queens and gouernour of the Kingdome, and no way was there to attaine to that imperial ſeat, but by marying with king Morindos, though not a match fit, he being diſcended royally, ſhe but nobly: yet by ſorceries, witchcrafts, and magicke deuiſes, ſhee obtained hir purpoſe, and in this manner obtained it.
               Vppon a time when King Morindos, in the height of his reuelles, whilſt ſome of his faireſt concubines, daunced before him naked in their cambrick ſmockes: the more to inkindle luſtes fire, ſhee entred the chamber of their licentious ſports, with a maske of wonder, the like neuer ſeene in Princes court: for all the Maskers (except hir ſelfe) were infernall ſpirrits, viſſible, but not tangable, all in the ſhape of young Ladis, attired in more changeable ſilkes then the collours of the Rainebowe: hir

ſelfe in a robe of ſuch richnes, as it ſémed to exceede the glorie of the ſunne for brightnes: hir owne bodie ſhee imbathed and ſupled with a water of ſuch inchantment, that what man ſoeuer firſt ſet eye vppon her, either preſent loue or preſent death, had deſtinie allotted him: for well knew ſhe that no man preſumed his preſence, during this time of pleaſure.
               This Madam Miracola, aſiſted by the blacke ſtates of hell, by deluſions won the kings loue: whoſe vnconſtant eyes, no ſooner firt their inflecting beames on this killing cokatrice: but all on a ſodaine fire his loue inflamed yt nothing could quench it, but hir loue ioyned to his, which were imediately ſealed togither: loue, deſire, and luſt, ſo conſpired againſt his bewitched heart, that he preſently avoided the chamber of his intifing damſels, and ſhee of hir deluding ſpirits: remaining then but two bodies, two hearts, and two tongues, he began to reueale loues ſecreſie in this manner: Madam quoth he (knowing hir to be a long attender in his court) good or euill fortune hath inchanted me, and now thy preſent loue or hate, muſt either glorifie me with earthly happineſſe, or ſend me wandring to the dark ſome walkes of death, where no ſoſcietie but crawling wormes and dead mens benes are reſident: deny me not therefore good Madam, I am this countries Potentate, I can commaund both wealths and power, cities, towers, and townes: Stateſmen ſtoope, and humly kneele vnto my ſoote: royalties, dignitles, and al other kingly promotions, are at my diſpoſing: vnto my pleaſurs all the land ſubmits: delights are my vaſſels, both land, & ſea as ſubiects ſtriue to make me happy: I am an earthly God, be thou my Goddeſſe, take all theſe honours, I will attend on thee, Ile bee thy ſubiect, thy ſeruant, I will kiſſe thy foote: deny not my loue for thou haſt bewitcht my heart, inchaunted me, fired mee with a quenchleſſe flame, all my boddie burnes and nothing but the ſweete Dewe of the graunt can

quallifie it: make mee either vnfortunate or happy ſweet Madame. This being breathed from his longing ſoule, ſhe farre more tractable to loues motions then he, made a full concluſion of a willing acceptance in this fort: I haue a minde imperious monarche (ſaid ſhe) ſoaring vp to the batlements of heauen, no bace deſires nor lowebred thought, ſhall any whit aſpire my princely will: I ayme at a kingly bed, where maisſtie ſleepes, whoſe chamber is imperious, garded with commanding ſtateſmen: ſeauen weary winters, and as many ſommers haue my hopes bene climing vp this kingly ladder, and now on the top of fortunes wheele am I fallen into a princes boſome: in louing me (great King) thou conquereſt fate, thou ſubiecteſt hell, thou maiſt (by my aſſiſtance) commaund legions of the black hoaſt to houer ouer thy Pallace, and in the twinkling of an eye, blaſt vp all thy wicked conſperators: if our mindes but once proue equall in the cheare of ſoueraingty, the earth ſhall be farre too little for thy gouernement: my magick charmes ſhall vnbowell the earth, rip vp her boſome, ranſack her rich treaſures for thy vſe: my magicke charmes for thee, and for thy pleaſure ſhall empty the vaſt Drean and cram thy kingdome with thoſe riches that mans eye hath not ſéene ſince the worlds creation: my charmes for thy content ſhall paue thy Court with pearles, emrodes and Diamonds: commaund great king, and the marble ſtones that now compaſe thy pallace ſhal daunce, and the ayer like ſinging Cherubins ſound vs heauenly hermony: contents delights, pleaſures, ioyes, and all the ſolaces of heauen and earth, ſhall be thy attendants by inueſting me thy equall in great maieſtie: thus, and in this manner did ſhe clime the ſupremacie, and tyed vpon her backe the title of a Quéeue. Being both inchanted thus, and intangled in the ſnares of deſire, they imediately tied Himens knot, aband that none ſunders but death: the mariage they ſolemnized the ſame night, not able to ſtay the mornings riſe,

but as blacke thoughts haue blacke euents, ſo in blacke manner was this mariage celibrated, it was even at the midle of night, when the Scritch-owle, Kockes, and Doremice, ſleepe in foggy miſtes: it was euen at that houre when the ghoaſtes of dead men walke, when murtherers dreame of villany, even when ye earth had her fable garments on, was this ſacred knot vnited, both being impatient of delay, he burning in luſt, ſhe aſpiring a kingdome, conuerted the holy temple to a mariage bed: be euer black this deede of hell, and neuer be it ſould but with a trembling tongue, for neuer was night more darke then this: the fable curtines of the ayer were all as pitch, and ſeemd ſo hide this poluted ſinne: the earth caſt vp ſuch a miſty vapour, that extingguiſhed both fire and creſſetlights: art could not make one candles flame, nor any meane of brightneſſe to beholde each other: ſo wicked was this enterpriſe of theirs, that both heauen & earth ſhewed fatall prodegies, and euerie thing (that diſmall night) grew different from nature: nothing was heard but bowling Dogges, croaking Loades, and hiſſing ſnakes, vnknowne voyces bellowed in the court, and the polluted Temple ſo vilely ſtained, was compaſſed about with gaſtly ſpirits, Fire-drakes and walking Goblins. But marke now the ſtrangeſt of al wonders, euen at the verie inſtant when the ſeede of procreation conioyned; euen as it were a crie of mandrakes ſtrooke the King into a madnes, blaſpheming heauen till his tongue grew dumbe, his eyes blinde, his eares deaſe, his ioyntes numbe, and all his bodye ſhapeleſſe. And as a Beare new whelpt like a lampe of fleſh without faſhion, lay claſped in the armes of this new made Queene. But now when the morning came, and that the light of heauen ſommond all creatures from ſleepe, the Nobles of his court came to his bed, five, thinking to giue them both a ioyfull good morrow, but euen as their lips gaue way to their tongues paſſage, their eies eſpied this fearefull accident: a iudgement that heauen hath

ſildome yet ſhowne, which was a king, deafe, dumb, blinde and ſenceles, by breathing life: which ſtraunge fight ſtroke the nobles into ſuch a maze, that without any further ſpeach they forſooke the court, confidently thinking it vnhappie, in harboring ſo vile a monſter as this king was. Now this new made Queene or damned inchantreſſe, hauing purchaſed a kingdome by hirblacke proceedings, was ſo blinded with the greatneſſe of maieſtie, and ſo rauiſhed with the brightneſſe of a crowne, being now ſole Queene and gouernour thereof, made a careleſſe ſport of gods indgment, and hauing in hir court none left but paraſites, and flatterers, ſuch as are commonly the right hands to principalities, made the greateſt ſinners the moſt honorable, and held the vitious in beſt regard: the deformed ſhape of the king hauing life but no ſences, ſhe cauſed to be put in a braſen coffen, and fed him dayly with humane blood, which ſhe poured into his mouth through quilles of filuer: the ſucceſſe hereof you ſhall heare in the next chapter, and what a ſtraunge conception ſhe had after this firſt night of hir mariage.
            
            
               
                  
                     Here the inchanted Queene made the Deuils a banquet with hir huſbands bodie: her three queſtions to the ſame Deuils, and their anſwers, and of her diſpairing lamentations in a darke dungeon.
                  
               
               Chap. 2.
               SDone blaſted were the hopes of this aſpiring Queene, and ſcowling miſchance with a bended brow, hemd in their mariadge bed: heauens wrath and hells fury, layd heauie burthens vppon them, and as it were, broke their heart-ſtrings aſunder: for Miracola, after ſhe had coffend her deformed huſband, yet breathing life, melancholly diſpaire

and pining griefe chiefely atended vppon her: diſcontent, ſuſpition, and feare were her gardiants by day, and by night: ſtraunge viſions, dolefull outcries & vnquiet dreames aſſayled her: wilde beaſts ſtraide from the woods and in ſame manner made them dennes within her court: vnlucky birds forſooke the ayre to ſit vippon her pallace, ſuch as nightowles and crooking rauens be, ſounding forth fatall and harſh harmony: the ſun ſeemd to ſhine vppon her with a ſcowling face, the moone as a ſhamd of her ſoulesdānation (in conferring thus wt deuills) as it were drew backe behinde the pitchy clowdes, and vnwillingly lent light vnto the meaner ſtarres: eache thing grew contrary to kinde, onely her ſelfe excepted, for ſhe hauing made an atonement with the princes of the fiery world, put her whole confidence in them, and onelye truſted through their aſiſtance, to lead Fortune in a ſtring and at her pleaſure commaund kingdomes. So vppon an euening, when the daies bright eye had left heauens ſater pallace, and night with her blacke canopie, had compaſt in the earth, ſhe betooke her to her priuate chamber, where Medea like, ſhe raiſed vp her ould ſeruants, the furies or rather the ſpirrits of darkenes, from their burning beds, ſuch as condemned ſoules lye flaming vppon, who no ſooner preſented themſelues before her, but ſhee queſtioned them in this manner: I charge you (quoth ſhe) you enemies to heauen and man, by the band and condition made betwixt you and me ſealed with my deareſt blood, and by the ſeauen ſucking babes that I once offred to you at midnight, and by the hope you haue of my ſoulos purchaſe at my deaths fatall hower, anſwere me truly to three ſeuerall queſtions which here I will preſently propound vnto you: firſt how long my life ſhall continue, ſecondly whether I ſhall die a Queene or not: laſtly the number of my children and their following fortunes: to which propoſttions, theſe inſtruments of miſchiefe imediately condiſcended to aunſwere, but vppon this ſtraunge condition following: that as a toe to theſe blacke barraſters, ſhee

ſhould deliuer vp her huſbands deformed body, and ſerue it to them in ſeauen ſeuerall banquets, that both his fleſh and blood, as a bribe to hell might be made foode for ſpirrits: which demaund to this woman monſter, ſeem'd but an eaſierequeſt, and therefore like to the viper, which feeds vppon her owne dam, gaue that life and body to the tyrany of hell, which ought to haue bene pretious in the eſe of heauen, and the deareſt iewell of her owne heart: Theſe diligent deceiuers hauing no ſooner promiſe of this purchaſed prize, but in a miſticali ſort, or riddle like, gaue anſweres to her three former queſtions, in this ſort: Firſt, for the continuance of her life, they ſaide ſhe ſhould liue til the ſeauen daies of the weeke were forgotten: the ſecond queſtion was, whether ſhe ſhould dye a queene or not, they anſwered that neither heauen nor earth, God nor man, ſhould take her kingdome from her: the third and laſt queſtion was, to know the number of her children and their following fortunes, to this they anſwered, that from her boodie ſhould ſpring ſeauen braunches, whoſe tops ſhould reach to heauen: Theſe anſwers to this accurſed womans eares, came more ioyfull, then the reports of pardon to a condemned man, and more pleaſing to her heart then for a mooriſh ſlaue from the cheaned gaily to be aduan'ſt vnto a kingdome: therefore with a ſetied truſt and aſſurauce of the ſpaniſh crowne and gouernment (litle miſtruſting the flie defeates of theſe miſticall anſweres) with all conuenient ſpeed prouided a chamber, wherein ſhe might performe her damned condition, and deliuer vp her huſbands body to the gluttony of hell: therefore aſcending to the top of her pallace, into a marble tower, ſhe cauſed her huſbands bodie to be bronght thether, and after commaunded the walles to be hung round about with blacke mourning cloth, to ſignifie her damned and fatall enterpriſe: this being done, ſhe purpoſed to deuide the ſeruice of her ſeauen bauquets into ſeauen ſeuerall daies, and in this manner were they accompliſhed: the firſt day vppon a table

of blacke Ebony, in two pron plates or platters, ſhe ſet the two legs of her vnhappy huſband, which ſo often (in his good daies of fortune) beſtride the warlike palfrey in the honour of his country: the ſecond day vppon the ſame Ebony table, ſhe placed his fine wd thighes (in two veſſels of lead) whoſe blew veignes, ſignified the force & ſtrength of manhood: the third day the likewiſe brought to the table his ſecret partes and bowels, in a veſſell of tin or pewter, wherein lay the ſeed of procreation: the fourth day ſhe furniſhed the ſame table, in a charger of braſſe, with the belly and inward partes of his body, which had ſo often bene cheriſht with delicious and princely banquets: the fift day in like manner in a veſſell of compounded mettle named alchemye, ſhe brought to the table his manly breaſt, which as a tower had many yeares cloſ'd vp his heart: the ſixt day in a platier of fine ſiluer, ſhe ſerued in ye two arms of her huſband, which whilſt vertue gouernd, held both theſcepter of peace and the ſword of warre: the ſeauenth and laſt, day in a veſſell of pure gould, being the deareſt and richeſt ſeruice, ſhe brought in his head, which had ſo often bene ornafied with an imperiall diadem, centaining a tongue that could in former times, haue giuen thée life or death: all theſe vnnaturall ſeruiſes by the hands of a woluiſh natured woman. Being no ſooner finiſhed, the fatall table auoſded, but both heauen and earth, land & ſea, as it were gaue echoes of terror: hell it ſelfe ſeemed to tremble, and ſpewed vp corrupted ſauors, & from her fiery furnaces, caſt abroad ſuch ſparckling flames, ye euen the imbrodered veſtures beſet with goldſmiths workmanſhip, ſo gorgeouſly beautifing her bodie, were fiered, and ſhe golden traniels of her haire, burnd from her head: notwithſtanding all this nothing amazed the ſhameles minde of Miracola, nor any way affrighted her wt the teror of heauens wrath, for ye thirſt of promotiō ſo bewitched her, ambitious pride ſo inchanted her, and the deſire of a diadem ſo imboldned her, that thinking both crown and kingdom her aſurance for euer, by ye falſe promiſes of hel: imediately

vpon this ſame tower or chāber wher ſhe had thus ſacrificed her husbands body, ſhe cauſed certaine characters or letters to be ingrauen vpon the marble walles, concerning her perpetuall happiness: The firſt ſuperſcription was to this effect following. Vpon this earth Miracola ſhalliue, till the ſeauen daies of the weeke be forgotten: which ſhe thought was foreuer.
               The ſecond ſuperſcription was: That neither heauen nor earth, God nor man ſhould take her kingdome from her.
               
               The third: That her children like ſeauen braunches ſhould reach to heauen.
               
               Theſe three promiſes ſhe regarded as Oracles, and beleeued that through them her earthly happines ſhould neuer end: but ſuddainely this violent ioy, turned into an extreame griefe, for as ſhe ſtood contemplating of theſe neuer-ceaſing delights, there entred inuiſiblie into the chamber, one of the blackepotentates of hell, and vnder euery one of theſe ſuperſcriptions, ingraued theſe ſignifications: Vnder the firſt this: The ſeauen daies of the weeke, be thy ſeauen daughters now breeding in thy wombe, who no ſooner ripe but rotten, no ſooner borne but forgoten.
               
               Vnder the ſecond: Though neither heauen nor earth, God nor man, will take the kingdome from thee, yet hel and the deuill ſhall.
               
               Vnder the third: The ſeauen braunches whoſe tops ſhould reach to heauen, be the ſeauen deadly ſinnes that ſhall ſpring from thy wombe, whoſe bloody enterpriſes and blacke deedes, ſhall clime heauen for an eternall Iudgement.
               
               Theſe diſmall and ominous reuelations, were no ſooner ceazed vppon, by the eyes of this accurſed Queene, but all the partes of her body trembled with feare: not a member but the terror thereof diſtempered: now feare of Gods vengeance by little and little entred into her heart, and the quiuering thought of hells damnation filld her boſome full of diſpaire: without all hope of ſaluation, ſhe incloſ'd

herſelfe in the centorie of the earth, in a caus where neither light of ſunne, nor the glimmering brightnes of the moone might diſcend, nor any voice of man or other creature could yeeld her comfort: thus excluding her ſelfe from all worldly ſolaces, committing the gouernment of hir kongdome to Scicophants and careleſſe guiders, ſhe waſted away the time of ten moneths, in this dark and ſolitarie dungeon, both day and night, making theſe or ſuch like wofell lamentations: Oh Nature (quoth ſhe) thou nurſe of euery liuing thing, why did it not thou end me in my firſt beginning? why did my mothers wombe, bring to light this my damned ſoule? why did my cradle rock this my body of perdition, to ſo many lullabies? I wiſh my nurſes pappe had peelded nought but venomed poyſon, and that my ſwathing clothes, had ben ſheetes of boyling lead, that both life and body at one inſtant had been both conſumed: but woe is me, I am reſecued for an eternal torment: my tongue bath conſented to my ſoules everlaſting damnation, and my hand ſeald to to a band that can neuer be cancel'd, till I becaſt into hels deuowring bowels: fall vpon me thou great frame of heauen & cover me: thunder-claps deſcend, whirle windes ariſe, and caſt me beyond the bounds of mans imaginations: thou ſpirit of red vengeance, tranſforme me to ſome venemous worme: make me without ſoule, or feeling, that my torments be not everlaſting: woe vppon woe purſues me, for the gayning of a crowne and kingdome, haue I sould and foreuer loſt my deare ſoule, whome all the treaſures both of earth and sea, nor the praſers of good men can euermore redeeme, curſt be mine eies that traind me to this damned ſtuddy: band be my tongue that pradiſd firſt these incantations: and woe to all my wits and ſenses, that so curſedly gaue over themselves, to theſe magick charmes now rane and rage, be you mad, diſtraught and lunaticke: dig vp the bowelles of the earth, and wander far beyond the Antipodes: but ob for euer weepe, weepe thou moſt miſerable ſoule, howle

and lament that griefe may ſplit aſunder thy ſad heart, for ſuch a woful heart neuer lin'd in womans breaſt: thus and in this maner ſpent ſhe in deepe lamentations, both minutes, howers, weekes and moneths, fill her wombe grew big, and the fruit therein ripe and ready to fall.
            
            
               
                  
                     How the inchanted Queene was deliuered of feawen daughters at one time: and how ſhe lay in child bed one and twentie yeares after.

                  NOw betwirt her prodegious and vnlucky mariage, ten times had the ſiluer moone renewd her brightneſſe, and the time of her deliuerie drew neare vnto the appointed hower: when in great torments both of ſoule and bodie, ſhe aſcended from her darke habitation, where, for fortie weekes, her rhiefeſt foode was ſorow, griefe and care: but now like vnto the owle aſhamed of the light, ſhe came abroad, and cauſed prouiſion to be made fitting for her deliuery: and although her Ladies inwardly hated her life and conuerſation, yet in charitie and chriſtian love, they attended her ſafetie, being conducted to her chamber, where the painefull hower of chlide bearing were to be inbured: the pinching throes ſo tortured her womb (bearing ſo ſtrange a burthen) that ſhe in verry griefe and agonie thereof, with her natles tore out her owne eies, and wonld haue rent the fruit aliue out of her wombe, had not the tender care of her Ladies preuented her: Thus ſightles and comfortleſſe fell ſhe in labor, wherein ſhe centinued in great extreamltle for the ſpace of ſeauen daies, making ſuch bitter mone, and breathing from her painefull heart ſuch dolefull groanes, as would haue forced euen merciles

Tigers to pittie: and ſo ſtraunge was her daliuerie, that the report thereof might fill large volumes with bitter lamentations: for in ſeauen daies ſhe brought forth ſeauen maiden children, euery one as hateful to the world, as the ſeauen deadly ſines: all at one birth, a thing ſildom ſeene, but that God in inſtice will ſhew his iuogement, vppon ſo inhumane a woman.
               The firſt was borne vpon the ſunday, which we compare vnto pride, as the courſe of verliſe hereafter ſhall because, which childe was called Sola, after the dates name.
               The ſecond vppon the munday, which we liken vnto enuy, according to her liues quallitie, and bore the name of Lucina.
               
               The third vppon tueſday, which we alude vnto wrath, and therefore named Martia.
               
               The fourth vppon wedneſday ſuppoſd to be couetouſnes, which we call Mercuria.
               
               The fiſt vppon thurſday, which we imagine to be dronhennes, and therefore we name her Iouina.
               
               The fixt vppon friday, which we place for letchery, and giue her the name of Venorina.
               
               The ſeauenth and laſt of this ominous brood, was borne vppon the ſaturday, which weterme to be ſloth, and ſo call her Saturnia.
               
               Thus was the ſeede of ſhame brought into the world, at whoſe birthes ſeauen black rauens, ſet croaking directly vppon the top of her chamber, and the howlets of miſchaunce, with fatall wings fluſtered againſt the chriſtall windows: eache one of them borne with teeth in their mouthes, whereat the midwife and other her aſiſtants (the Ladies there preſent) were much amazed, and with trembling hearts ſeared to behold ſo ſtrange a ſpectacle of nature: but as fate and deſtinye had alotted, they of their owne fres willes, prouived for theſe ſeauen monſters (thus borne) ſeauen ſeuerall nurſes, the wiues of ſeanen ſhepheares, which anely had their habitations, in woddig

die caues, where they were diligently brought vp and not once ſuffered till their full age to come within the Court gates, where we will leaue them to fortunes direction for a time: The wofull mother of theſe vnfortunate children, being now ſafely deliuered, (through her owne extreame violence, lying ſightleſſe in her childbed, the onely foe to worldly delights) in the hearing of many ſtanders by, breathed forth this pittifull complaint: oh how happy is the ſilly worme (ſaide ſhe) that hath neither ſoule nor vnderſtanding, whereby the threatning of euerlaſting torments may not affright it the miſeries of this worlde wherein I now deſeruedly lie, are but as delights & ſports in regard of them I ſhall feele! when the doomes daye of my life is paſt. I lye now as it were vppon a bed of pricking thornes, & ſtung with a thouſand ſerpentine ſtings: but woe is me, my guiltie conſcience doubts, that for my wilfull looſing of my ſoule. I ſhall lye boyling in the red hotte chaldron of damnation, more thouſands of yeares; then blades of graſſe growe vppon the earth, leaues vpon trees, or ſtarres in ye chriſtall firmament: and more, which terrifies my condemned ſoule, I ſhall ye there in conſuming paine, (but neuer conſumed) more millions of yeres then as if a heap of ſand ſhould lye on earth, whoſe toppe ſhould reach to heauen, and once in euery million of yeres an eagle ſhould fetch away but one ſand, yet would thoſe yeares of torments haue an end, but mine can neuer finiſh, for ſelling that ſweete ſoule that my deere ſauiours life was ſhed for: me thinkes I heare ſeauen ſucking babes knocking at heauen gates for vengeance againſt me, for giuing vp their tender bodies as a foode for ſpirrits: me thinks I heare ſeauen virgins (all the daughters of mightie Potentates) accuſing me for inchanting them, to a heape of ſenceles ſtones: me thinkes I heare ſeauen aged men, whoſe heads were beawtified with milke white pledges of wiſdome, all comming as witneſſes againſt me, for ſucking way their blood by ſpirrits, in the likenes

of aspes and adders, and after ſacrificing the marrow of their bones, to the chiefe Prince of darknes, for which my conſcience now tels me, ye heauens yron hand of vengeance in euen ready to ſtrike, and that hells wrath is inuenting now tortures for my ſoule: and now there is a horred voice thunders in mine eare, that this my euer ſtained crime ſhall be alſo ſcourged in my ſeede, and all my kinred waſht from the face of the earth, into the vnknowne vault of forgetfulnes: and now in ſpeaking theſe words, all her ioints grew lame and numbe, thereby to ioyne in equall miſery with her ſightles eyes: where we will leaue her now, as the picture of calanutie, lying in childbed, for the ſpace of one and twentie yeares, and ſpeake of her childrens miſfortunes, whoſe liues were as ovious to the world, as the ſeauen deadly ſinnes.

                  THeeldeſt and firſt childe of this viperous Queene, borne vppon a ſunday, hearing the name of Sola, and being the true picture of pride, in life and nature perſeuering in that deadly ſinne, for being no ſooner growne to the ripeneſſe of age, and that the yeares of diſcreation had grafted hir with vnderſtanding ſhe was by the nobles and ladies of the Land, brought to the court, in hope that after her mothers deceaſe (by the decree of frowning chaunce, lying then in marnelous calamities ſhee would proue a gratious and good

queene, but it happened farre otherwiſe, for being now on the way of preferment, and cluning vp the ſteps of imperiall dignitie, a kinde of commaunding pride ſo bewitched her, that ſhe eſteemd her ſelfe aboue womans kinde, and that nature had framd her of no earthly ſubſtance, but rather of the pure mould of celeſtiall angels: her crimſon coloured cheekes whereon the glory of beautie ſeemd to ſhine her iuory front or forehead where art and nature ſtroue for ſupremaſie: and her bright twinckling eyes, within whoſe pretty balls, the God of loue ſeemd to ſhew himſelfe, were al in her proved imaginations too pretious for the ſun to ſhine vppon, and her ſelfe, with al other partes of her bodie, the moſt pure workmanſhip of natures experience, ſhe held too angel like, to tread vpon the groſe earth: therefore ſhe, (the more to aduance her great pride) cauſed a chariot of chriſtal glaſſe to be made, cloſe framed on al ſides to keepe both winters blaſtes and ſommers heat from her delicate bodie: the which chariot by skilfull art was waſted vp and downe, by artificial meanes deuiſed mans inuention: her foode was the pureſt reſtoroties of the earth, both of beaſtes, birds, fowles and fiſhes, and the onely quintiſence of nouriſhments to maintaine life: her pleaſures were the muſique and ſinging voices of young virgins, the daughters of noble men and knights: her garments were of the fineſt Medean ſilkes, weau'd vpon ſiluer loomes by Arabian queenes: Thus pomp and pride eleuating her minde, as it were beyond the ambition of Lucifer, who ſought to pull God out of heauen and eſteemd no man of that royall birth, worthy to match with her in miriage: Emperors and kings ſhe accounted but as ſlaues to fortune, and the onely ſubie as to variable chaunce: many high perſonages enterprizd the conqueſt of her loue, but reaped the fruites of deniall and diſgrace, and were not ſuffered that aſuming ſauour, as once to kiſſe her prowd hand: yet al laſt three bould aduenturous gallants, hearing her thūdring fame rumord about the world,

attempted to purchace the cōqueſt of this prize, that neither Emperours nor kings could obtaine:
               The firſt was a Soldier, whoſe valor and matchles thinarie, vpon the wings of fame was carried by and down the earth, as far as euer the golden eie of heauen hath ſhewen his gliſtering brightneſſe.
               The ſecond was a Scholler, whoſe Academick skill in all the ſeauen liberall ſciences, might challenge in all princes courts, the honours of the golden tongue.
               The third and laſt was a marchant, whoſe trauelles by ſea, round about the earth, compaſſing ſeauen times the equinoctiall line, purchaſed ſuch wealth, as builded one of the greateſt citties in the world: Theſe three (times honored champions) comming before this prowd Ladie of the earth, who ſitting then like a goddeſſe, vpon the tribunall ſeat of majeſtie, began their loues embaſſage, in this manner.
               Deuine Sola (ſaide the Soldier) thou miracle of woman kinde, at whoſe birth good fortune daunced, this bodie of mine is become thy humble vaſſell, and now yeelds all his purchaſt honours at thy gracious feete: I that by warre haue foragd kingdomes, vnpeopled countries, and made whole fields flowing with blood, wil now at thy roial commaund, kiſſe the ſacred plot of ground, where thy celeſtiall foote but ſtangeth: I that haue dyed the flinty pauements of conquered cities with the purple goare of humaine carkaſſes: and fed my pampered ſteedes with the fleſh of man, am now ſubiected to thy thrice glorious perſon, and challendge to my ſelfe, no other happines, but one ſmiling glaunce from thy angellicall eyes: graunt then thy loue thou Iewell of nature, and let my ſoule feed vpon the 
                     〈◊〉
                   pines that proceedes from the cenſure of thy bleſſed tongue in condiſcending to my loue: legions of aduenturous knights ſhall fill thy pallace with renowne, and by their knightly proweſſe, fetch conquered kings from al the parts of the world, to one obeyſance to thy imperiall greatneſſe.

And in louing me great princeſſe (qd. the ſcholler) the vnſearched ſtudies of all ſciences, ſhall be at thy commaund: the pleaſures of muſique, the helpes of phiſicke, the eloquence of tongues, the ſecrets of ſtarres, the natures of nations, and moreouer the ſweet conſolation of deuine meditations, ſhal eleuate thy ſoule to the ſhining paradice of vnſpeakeable bleſſednes: then make a ſcholler happy in thy lone ſweet Sola, in whoſe deepe vnderſtanding, lye the ſecrets both of aire, earth and ſea.
               And in louing me thou paragon of beawtie, (quoth the marchant) the far fetcht treaſures of rich India, the gould of Arabia, and the vnualued carbuncles of goulen Ganges, aboundantly ſhall fall into thy lap: I haue meaſured the earth ſeauen times about, and vpon the ſea ſpread ſuch a fleete of ſhips, and rich Argoſes, which like to a topleſſe forreſt ſeemd to hide heauen, all theſe for thee and for thy loue ſhal ſayle to thoſe nations where no ſunne ſhines, nor moone giues light: to thoſe kingdomes where one night continues ſixe months, (and their purchaſe by long trauel) thoſe ineſtimable valued veſtures, which had wont to beawtifie the prowd queenes of Aſia: bamasks, goalden tiſſues, and robes of ſiluer, shall be as common to thy delights, as rich ſcarlets were to the princes of Iudea: in louing me thou ſhalt be atended with more roilties, then king Salomon was in all his pompe: theſe and ſuch like were the proffered curteſies of theſe three gallant gentlemen, euery one hoping thereby to obtaine the good will of this prowd Ladie: who was as far from kind acceptance of their ſeruices, as the starued Lioneſſe is from merry when the ceazeth vpon the innocent lambe: therefore rething no other councellors but pride and ambition, the onely nurses of confusion, without any further conſideration, made them this anſwere.
               That man (high ſpirited gentlemen) that in my bed ſhall ſet his foote, and crop the bud of my virginitie, the which I haue denied vnto kinges, ſhall win the ſame grace

with a ſeuere taske or knightly aduenture. First to you, thou vndaunted knight of war, if thou canſt either by policy or manhood, either wit or conqueſt of thy ſword, gaine and purchaſe me a bed, that ſhall be fild with a ſofter ſubſtance then the ſoft downe, that grows vppon the milke white ſwans backe, thou ſhalt inioy my loue, and I will onley be thy wife: Likewiſe to thee thou ſcholler like man of art, if by thy learning or any other deep miſtery, thou cāſt frame me a fountaine, that ſhall containe a purer water then that which raines from heauen, or that which ſprings from the cundets of the earth. thou ſhalt gaine my loue, and I will be onely thy wife. Lastly to thee thou noble adventurous marchāt, if thou by any trauaile either by land or ſea, canſt finde me a bread that ſhall be better then that of wheat, thou ſhalt haue my loue, and I will onely be thy wife. Vpon theſe ſtrict conditions, or rather Nerculian labours, theſe three gallants without any further reply, departed each one his ſeurall way, ſtriuing which of them ſhould accompliſh the taske propoſed vnto them: where we will leaue them for a while trauailing ſtraunge cuntries, dilligently ſeeking to bring theſe their ſtraunge labours to an end, and ſpeake of the woful miſeries that the heauen aflicted this prowd Ladie withall.
               Many months paſſed ouer the head of this hated woman after their departures: and as ſhe grew in age, ſo did her pride increaſe, in ſomuch that for the mainteinance of her vaine beautie, ſhe had atending vppon her a hundred of faire and yong wiues, that once euerie day with the milke of their breaſts, fild a ceſtern of fine gould, with the which euery morning ſhe bathed her bodie, onely to make her beawtiful faire and white skin more ſmooth and amiable: and that foode which nature gaue for the nouriſhment of young infants, according to Gods will, ſhe wickedly abulediu the mainteinance of pride and in the ſeruice of the deuill: This vile courſe of life ſhe long wandred in, looſing herſelfe in the wilderneſſe of blacke iniquitte, till the allſeeing

ſeeing eies of wrath deſcended heauen, and in a moment ſtrooke this prowd exeature, into ſuch on ovious leaproſie, that neither eye could indure her ſight, nor noſtrellavide her corrupting ſauours: now that bodie ſo finely framd of natures chiefeſt mould, that lately would not indure the whiſtling of the gentle windes, were now more lothſome then the ſpotted adder: and that cleare celeſtiall face, that diſdaind to entertaine the comfortable heate of the warme ſunne, was now more ovious (to mans ſight) then the ſwelling toad and all thoſe Ladies that had wont to atend vppon her, forſooke her company, and fled her chamber, as from adenne of ſnakes: they that kept neareſt to her, were diſtreſſed people and vile malefactors, ſuch as were lately deliuered from loathſome priſons and deepe dungeons: and theſe in contempt of heauens iudgement, cauſed ſhe with ſharpe raſers to flea off the vpper skinne, from her ſpotted face and leaprous bodie, in hope that a new, young, and freſh skinne would againe growe, and that her beawtte in a liuely manner would againe be repleniſhed, and not as now blemiſhed with one ſtained ſpot or ſoule vlcer: all this according to her will was imediately performed, but to ſmall purpoſe, for the enuy of heauen cloathed with red vengeauce had doomed her to a miſerable death, for neither art nor nature, by any practiſe could euer after couer her hated bodie with any kind of skin, but that all hir fleſh contine wed rawe and loathſome, and putrified vnto her bones: in this torment (as a iudgement of hir pride) remained ſhe, deſiring death, but could not dye, til the moone had twice twelue times renewd her brightnes, and that the earth had twice put on her ſpring (times liuery) and twice froſtie bearded winter diſrobd dame natures Gardens: then, oh then returnd the three wandring louers, with conqueſt of their ſtraunge adventures, earth one hoping to reape the deſerts of their true merrits.
               The Soldier whoſe taske was to finde a bedde fild

with a ſolter ſubſtance then the downe feathers of ſwans, in this daungerous manner brought he his labour to an end.
               First, after his departure from this prowd Lady Sola, he trauelled many ſtrange countries, meeting with many ſtraunge people, and in ſearching many ſtrange places, he happend into a caue, where liu'da Satyr of ſuch bignes, as mans eye had hardly ſeene: this Satyr liu'd vppon the ſpoile of traueliers, within whoſe Caue lay the ſignes of ſuch as he had murthered and deuowred: the number of the dead bones and ſculles which lay heaped there together, draue ſuch an admiration into the ſoldiers heart, that for a time his feare ſo abounded that hee ſtood as it were ſenceles: but at laſt being ornefied with the bould courage of manhood, hee drew foorth his ſhort ſemiter, and with one blow ſmote of the Satyrs head, whilſt he lay ſleeping vppon a bedde ſtuffed with nothing but winde, the which the ſoldier no ſooner perceiued, but he verily beleeued his taske to be ended, and that a bedde ſtuffed cloſe with winde, were farre more ſofter then the downe of ſignets, ſo taking vp the ſame bedde, and packing it vppon his Bennet behinde him, he arriued as you heard at the pallace of this prowd Ladie, whoſe miſfortunes with fatall newes no ſooner gaue him intertainement, but he fell into a melaucholly diſpaire, and now ſeeing his long and dangerous trauailes, reaping no better ſucceſſe, as one wearied both of life and good chaunce, conuaide the ſaide windie bedde into a field, vp to the toppe of a high mountaine, where vppon he laide his bruſed bodie, and was by the ſaide winde imediatiely carried away for euer.
               The Scholler whoſe long tranells and deepe ſtuddie, nothing inferiour to the Soldier, after he had ſpent two yeares practice in framing a Fountaine, that ſhould yeelde ſuch a Water, that neither rayned

from heauen, nor ſprung from the conduits of the earth: a taske as he thought impoſſible yet good chaunce ſo directed his ſteps, that he ariued in the Ile of Delphos, at the Dracle of Apollo, who after his deuine ſacrifice, had this pleaſing anſwere reuealed to him: The dew of heauen is neither water from the clowds, nor water ſpringing from the earth: replenith a fountaine therewith and ſo conquer fate, for inded he conquered fate: for at his returne to the prowd Ladies court, in hearing of heauens iudgement laid vppon her, and how that he had conſumed two yeres labor to no effect, he preſently fell lunaticke and dyed. Laſtly, the marchant taſted of deaths cup, as dearly as the others did, for after he had brought a bread far better then the bread of wheat, which is the bread of ſaluation, the ſacred bible of God which he fetcht from the temple in Ieruſalem: but when he ſaw the end of his hopes rewarded with a viſion of calamitie, he departed to a deſert wilderneſſe, onely inhabited with wilde beaſtes, where for want of foode, he famiſhed himſelfe to death.
               Then Sola after ſhe had inteligēce of the liues ruins, of thoſe 3. gallāt gentlemen, whom ſhe had ſo cruelly doomed to miſerable trauailes, and that for her ſake they all three loſt their liues, ſhe in great diſpaire of eternall happineſſe, breathed her ſoule into the aire, wiſhing her ſir ſiſters by her example to imbrace humilitie.

               LVcina being the ſecond daughter to the inchanted queene, bearing in her breaſt the burning fier of enuy,

neuer differed from that deadly ſinne, all the date of her wretched life: for after the diceaſe of her prowd ſiſter, no long time paſſed on, before Iulianus then king of France, tooke her in mariage, whoſe nuptiall rights theſe two countries ſolemnized, in moſt princely manner, and the chiefeſt delights and pleaſures belonging to a Queene daily attended vpon her: all things ſhe could either wiſh or deſire were at her commaundment: heauen and earth concluded to make her a happy princeſſe: onely this, content of minde wanted, for nature denied to fructifle her bodie, and grace her with the name of a mother: therefore in wanting children ſhe grew enuious to the world, and ſpighted thoſe women that heauen had ſo bleſſed: now in proceſſe of time, the king, queene and the nobilitie of the land road a progreſſe, into the countrie, more by their preſence to win their ſubiects loue, then for their owne contents and pleaſure: and as in great ſtate, and moſte princely manner, they paſſed by a foreſt ſide, where then was ſcituated the caſtle of an auncient knight, and an old ſeruit or to the kings father in the chriſtian warres, and therefore was intitled one of the knights of the Roads, in which caſtle as the queene paſſed by, a moſte pleaſant and delightfull melodie of muſique ſounded in her eare, at which not ſaeing any, ſhe greatly maruelled, and demaunded the cauſe of that extraordinarie reioyſing: the anſwere was, that vppon that day was borne to the knight and ladie of the caſtle, a man childe, who neuer before that time, for the ſpace of twelue yeres, was grac'd with any: is this the cauſe (ſaide the queene) now I ſée bace ſubiects in diſgrace of the queenes barrennes, will not ſticke but make therof a may-game, and to mine owne eares giue me a diſhonourable ſcandall, as I am now queene of frannce this their preſumption ſhall be quittanced with death, and ſhort ſhalbe the ioy they receiue in this childes birth: thus enuy like a conquerer, ſeazd vppon all the parts of her bodie: & with the vndeſerued hate ſhe bore vnto this knight

and his ladie, her verry heart plotted ſtraunge confuſion 
                     •
                   all the way as the road along not a word proceeded from her month, but ſanord of enuy and mallice, and not a flumber cloſed vp her eyelids, but it begot dreams of hate and furie: all her meditations were of the ouerthrow of theſe two guiltieſſe ſoules, who little miſtruſted what deadly plots ſhe deciſed againſt their deare liues: eury day to this enuious queene ſeemd a yeare till their progreſſe ended, which as ill fortune had allotted, was broke of in this manner.
               The commous of Normandie and Pikardie, made an inſurrection againſt the nobilitie, and none but the kings preſence could alay their tumulteous furies, who with al ſpeede, princely prouided with men, mony and munition, tooke his iorney towards them, whoſe abſence no ſooner gaue way to the queenes mallice, bat ſhe diſpatched a meſſenger (one of the groomes of the kings chamber) to the betraied knight and his ladie, not yet churched commanding them by the dewtie of aleadgeance, to repaire vnto the court, and giue attendance in her chamber, till the kings returne (onely as ſhe diſſembled) the deareſt friends to truſt vnto.
               This meſſage of the Queenes pleaſure, being no ſooner deliuered to the knight and his ladie, but as dutifull ſubiects, reioyced that their ſeruices in the kings abſence, could bring vnto the queene ſuch high pleaſure, therefore leauing their caſtle in quiet gouernment, with all conuenient ſpeede they repaired to the queenes pallace, bearing with them their little childe, who at the firſt were intertaind with a friendly regard, and their childe by the queenes commaundment taken from them, and as ſhee ſaide) put feorth to nurſe: but ſuch a bloodie nurſery I think neuer tender babe induced: little ſuſpected the good knight and his gentle ladie, what a balefull banquet was preparing for them, for the enuious and angry queene, in ſteed of tender paps to giue the infant nouriſhment, ſhee

commaunded it to be made foode for that wombe, that gaue it firſt life: is hauing blooddie miniſters readie prepared for that tirranicall enterprize according to her wicked meaning, the preſtie babe as a ſeruice (bakt in a pie) was brought to the table of the vnhappy parents, whome the queene had then placed in two chaires in her chamber, directly the one againſt the other, where after they had ſaitiſfied hanger (vnknowne to them) with the fruit of their owne howels, ſhe locking faſt the chamber doore, aſiſted by three or feure bloody murtherers, prouided for the ſame purpoſe, and bound them both faſt in their chaires with hempen coardes, bands vnſitting for ſuch noble minded perſonages, and being now ſeltered in the gins of confuſion with an enuious tongue ſhe vitered forth the rancour of her heart in this manner.
               Maruell not prowd knight (quoth the queene) nor thou thou painted minion of beawtie, at this your ſodaine miſuſage, for till I behould both your hearts liueleſſe, your eyes ſightles, and your tongues ſpeachles, the rauening fawes of fury feeds vppon my ſoule: what hath nature in you grafted more then in me? you being bacely borne, haue the gifts of children, I royally deſcended, am made barren, by deſteny: and becauſe the ſeede of procreation proſpers in your adulterous beds, you liue in all ſollitie, making reioycing melodie to my diſgrace, whilſt I pining in woe, vainely deſiting children cānot obtaine them: therefore know that I being a queene, hauing a boddie yong, faire, and likely to conceaue, croſt and ſpighted by the cruelties of nature, haue proteſted a ſecret reuenge againſt you, and all ſuch as ſo my diſhonour haue their bodies ſeeming with children: and now you two ſhall be the beginners of my intended maſſacars: therefore knowe, as the firſt act to this my blacke tragedie, you haue fed and ſatiſfied hunger, with the fruit of your owne bowels: ſo vppon thee (thou father of this deed infant, by thine owne ſelfe heere deuowred) I will extend ſuch a

torment, as neuer Lirant deuiſed, but as thou art a Soldier, ſo Soldier like ſhalt thou finiſh vp thy daies, whervppon ſhe cauſed an armour burning red hot from the fire to be brought, and without either mercy or pittie, buckeld it vnto his naked backe, where (like vnto Hercules putting on the ſhirt that cruell Neſſus ſent) he made ſuch pittifull moane as might haue inforced teares to fal from a Tigers eye, and the verry marble ſtones giue ſignes of laments, but poore knight as without cauſe he indurd this dying puniſhment, ſo with great patienes yeelded he vp his ghoaſt, in the ſight of his beloued Ladie, who being no leſſe perplered with the frights of pale death, awaited the fatall hower of the like dying torments, which according to her ſorrowfull expectation, ſhe was imediately preſented withall, for whilſt ſhe ſate faſt bound in her chaire, gazing vppon the dead broiled bodie of her huſband, this enuious queene cauſed her to be ſtript ſtarke naked, and to her two tender breaſts, placed two ſpeckled venomd ſnakes, almoſt ſtarued for want of foode, which with their poiſoned ſtings ſuckt her hearts life blood quight through her breaſts, during which time of her dying torments, continuing for the ſpace of an hower, theſe and ſuch like lamentations ſhee breathed foorth.
               Oh you dreadfull powers of heauen! why in a milde womans breaſt, haue you placed a Tigers heart? why haue you ſuffered kinde to worke againſt kinde, nature againſt nature, and reaſon againſt reaſon? one woman thus cruelly to betray another? oh where is gentlenes become? whether is mercy fled? one beaſt will not hurt each other, the vileſt worme the earth breedes, will by nature pittie one another: but here is a woman that hath ſhamd her ſex, diſtaind nature, poluted woman kinde, an enemie both to heauen and earth: ſhe hath made me huſbandleſſe, and childleſſe, and imediately will make me liueleſſe: oh thou celeſtiall tower, where iuſtice ſits enthroaned open thy glorious gates toe utertaine a widows curſe, ſtrike downe

with a heauy hand, let ſhame and diſtruction perſue her to death, let ſome miracle of her tirany be the worlds mark till doomes day: ſome ſtrange confuſion finiſh vp her life to appeaſe the ſoules of three vnfortunate wretches, onely made miſerable through the enuy of a malicious queene: and now thou earth farwell, thou nurſe and mother of my life adiew, let three liues in two bodies be in thy boſome intombd, for now I feele deaths wrath tearing my heart in ſunder and the verry minute of my life fading, and gentle death now art thou welcome: thus with a groane I cloſe thee in my boſome: and in ſpeaking theſe wordes the braunches of her life witheced: The enuious queene thus triumphing in the victorie of their deſtructions, not any whit relented at the pitteous moane of this good Ladie, but like an vntamed Panther, deuiſed new cruelties againſt their dead bodies, which ſhe performed in this vile maner: Contrary to good nature and all humanitie, ſhe cauſed a furnace to be heat red hot, and therein conſumed the ſubſtance of theſe dead bodies into pale aſhes, from whences flew ſparckling flames of fire, like flakes of bloud vp towards heauen, as it were chalendging vengeance at the throne of maieſtie.
               Theſe tirannicall deedes both againſt life and death were no ſooner effected, but news came vnto her, of her Princely huſbands returne from quieting the cōmons tumults, whom ſhe purpoſed with a diſembling countenance of ioy to entertaine: ſo atiring herſelfe in her richeſt ornaments, attended on with a troope of honourable Ladies, ſome mile diſtant, from her blood-ſtained pallace, ſhe gratulated the king with a princely welcome home: but (as the angry fates had iuſtly decreed) before the word of welcome could proceed from her mouth, the heauens caſt ſuch a darke clowd ouer yt earth, with ſuch a feareful tempeſt, and thunder, that the fruites of the earth flamed & the leaues of trées were ſcortched to ſatiſfie ye angry wrath of heauen, wherat the king afrighted in minde, challenged the queene of ſome

black miſdeed by her committed, beauy in the ſight of heauen, in being thus offended with the world, but ſhe whoſe heart, bluſhies ſinne had hardned, grew impatient at his ſpeaches, and wiſht that beauen might make her one of the worlds wonders, if euer ſhe wrought or conſented to any deede of ſhame, other then what vertue put her in minde to dee. this preſumptious wiſh of hers ſo diſpleaſed the al-ſeeing powers, that imediately the bowels of the earth cleaued, and ſwallowed her vp aliue into her gaping wombe: and directly in the ſame place where in ſinking ſhe gaue the world a farwell, sprung vp a blood red ſtatue of stone, ſeeming to haue weeping eies, and wringing hands, which to this day there ſtill ſtands, and is recorded in the french Annalls to be one of the ſeauen wonders of Fraunce: the king hauing a confetence touched with remorce and dreading leaſt the heauy wrath of Heauen, ſhould for her blood-ſtained ſinne light vppon the whole country: therefore after he had ſearched out the whole faction of this blacke miſdeed, and put them to execution: as a pilgrime bare legd, bare footed, clothd in bairecloth, be wandred to Ieruſalem, and at the Sepulcher of Iudaes God, craud remiſſion for this his dead queenes offence: by which meanes he waſht away this ſtayned ſpot, from his countries browe: and after ſpent his daies in tranquillitis and peace.

               THe third ſiſter of this fatall generation, might in the right of nature, challenge as great ſupremaſie of beautie

as the other her two former ſiſters: and not onely an amiable countenance and comely proportion, ornefied hir outward ſhape, but an excellent gift of art and nature beautified her inward parts, for her minde being repleniſhed with artificial miſreries, ſo indiciall in the tongues of learning, ſo perſit in eloquence, ſo curtons in needle-workes, the only excerciſe of prinees, that the world eſeemed her one of the muſes darlings, and the verry parragon of woman kinde: in her the whole lands happines conſiſted: the onely excellent artiſt of her time, hauing a ſupernaturall gift, in the noble ſcience of Limming. Wherein ſhe greatly delighted, and the more to make her fame glorious in the world, ſhe with a pencell portraied in a map or picture, the frame of the creation of the world: euery thing in his right ſhape, ſo liuely ſet foorth, as both beaſtes, fowles and ſiſhes ſeemed to retatine life: the ſunne, moone and ſtarres, as it were gaue a kinde of light, ſo artificially ſhaddowed ſhe their quallities: woods, fieldes, and foreſts appeared properly gréene and flouriſhing, and the watry ſea gliding thorough the earths boſome, gliſtereb like chriſtall, and her ſwelling billowes ſeemd to riſe and fall, that no earthly eye could make a diffrence betwirt them and the ſurges of the vaſtocean.
               This excellent peece of workmāſhip being to her hearts content finiſhed, was ſet to the open vew of all eies, challenged a ſuperioritie in that miſerie aboue all others of the time: but now amongſt many that came from al parts of the kingdome, to behold this race peece of workmanship, there came one, whoſe skill therein, the whole earth admired, the which in former times had bin tutor to this Princeſſe and firſt inſtructed her in the principles of this delightfull arte: this reuerent man (for his milkewhite head claimd reuerentneſſe) after he had in the preſence of many noble perſonages, circumſpecty vewed euery ſecret of this rare worke, and marking euery curyous ſhadow how it was laide, laſtly found a deformitie in

the portraiture of man, and to this Princeſſe diſgrace, as ſhe tooke it, found great fault therewith, at which Marſias wrath ſo inkindled, and with ſuch flames fiered her whole bodie, that in preſence of all the nobilitie, with a ſiluer bodkin ſtriking in the goulden trammuels of her haire, ſhe furiouſly ſtabbed the good old man vnto the heart, ſo greatly her wrath preuailed: this bloodie and inraged fact, by the whole aſſembly was generally lamented, and by her wrathfull hand no ſooner done but repented, for wrath being of nature ſodaine, a little ouerpaſſed, conuerts into remorſe, ſo happened it with this Ladie, for when her eye beheld the purple goare of his liueles heart, panting vpon the ground, ſhe ſtriued in reuenge thereof to teare out her own eies, and would haue committed that bloody crueltie vppon her ſelfe, had not the ſtanders by preuented her, wherevpon in great agonie, ſhe vttered foorth this inraged complaint.
               Oh why will not heauen (quoth ſhe) take my blood ſtained life, and breath into his breathles bodie new aire? or why may not my eyes forſake their hated cels, within his eies to giue a ſeeing power: oh ye this breaſt of mine were now vnbowelled, and this my wrathfull heart torne from my boſomes cloſſet, and ſacrifiſed vppon that carkaſſe, which my cruell hand hath vntimely ſlaine: be therefore of thou fatal hand, for euer lame, deny to giue ſuſtenance to this my vile bodie, harboring now nothing but cogitations of reuenge: graunt this oh heauen, that from hencefoorth I may neuer taſt one bit of foode in ioy, nor walke abroad but in diſcentent, nor ſteepe but in frightfull feares, nor dreame but of melancholly diſpaire, for my ſodain hand hath ſlaine, the miracle of humanitie, within whoſe head, (whilſt life laſted) dwelled true wiſedome, a tongue tipt with eloqnence, and a voice reſounding reports of celeſtial vnderſtanding: theſe and ſuch like paſſions vttered ſhee from the fury of her repentant ſoule, which imediately had broake her heart ſtrings, had not the care of her Ladies,

(then there atending) conducted her to her chamber, where they with the harmony of muſique and melodie of voices, rockt her grieued ſences into a ſilent flumber, in which quiet reſt (as they imagined) they left this diſtreſſed princes: but far otherwiſe happeneth ſtill to a troubled minde, for as ſhe lay ſighing and ſobbing vppon her bed, greeuing at the blood ſhe ſo wrathfully ſpilt, there appeared before her face, the gaſtly ſhape of the murthered old man, wan, & pale in viſage: breathing forth hollow groanes, to the déepe terror other ſonle, and ſeemd to her affrighted eies, to open the cloſſet of his bleeding breaſt, as it were thirſting for reuenge, and deſiring blood for blood: This fearefull and ſtrange ſight, ſo deepely moleſted her conſcience, that from that time forward, ſhe baniſhed away al thoughts of tereſtialliay, and delighted in nothing but her owne confuſion, ſo heauy lay the guilt of murther vppon her ſoule, for after that time not any foode would ſhe euer take into her bodie, nor euer after indure the fellowſhip of people, nor neuer ſuffer one ſmall flumber to cloſe vp her eye lids, but in great woe and miſerie, ouerwatched and pined her ſelfe to death, to the great diſcomfort and ſorrow of the whole land, who by a generall conſent, intombed both their bodies in one graue, and erected there vppon a ſumptuous ſepulcher, the which to this day ſtandeth in great glory in the citie of Paris.

alprincely deſires, accoūting thē the brāds of ambitiō, & the onely ſpurs of diſtruction: ſo making her three former ſiſters a memoriall example of princip allities downefall, ſhe purpoſed to ſpend her daies as a ſhepheardiſſe in the countrie, where in ſtead of a royall court, ſhe had the ſiluaine fieldes and mountaines to liue in, & in piace of her princely attendance, ſhe had her flocks of ſheeps to delight in, whoſe plentifull increaſe of wooll, wereas the treaſures both of land and ſea: her imperiall diadem, was her ſheepshooke: her pleaſurable muſique, the chirping melodie of birds: her guard, the pretty watchfull curre, that with his ſhirle barking gaue notice of inſuing daungers: and the treaſons complotted againſt her, were the tiranny of deuowring wolues: but ſnch was her ſiluaine care and countrie dilligence, that her flocks ſuſtained ſmall hurt by the bloody rage of this ſpoiler, by which means in ſhort time, her riches grew vnualuable, and her treaſures without number: but the greedy thirſt of her wealths further increaſe, ſo bewitched her inſatiate deſires, that her verry ſoule grew ſotted with vile couetouſnes, and the ſmalleſt loſſe thereof drew drops of blood from her heart: ſhe feared to truſt the aire with her mony, leaſt the winde ſhould conſume it away: nor the earth, leaſt the wormes ſhould conſume it: nor the ſea, leaſt fiſhes ſhould purloine it: but in a more ſecurermanner (as ſhe thought) the intended to hide it betwirt heauen and earth, that both months, weeks daies, and howers, ſhe might with the ſight thereof glutte the ſight of her thirſtie eies, ſo hauing a huge ſome of pure gould, cloſed in an Iorne truncke, the which in a darke gloomy night, (the ſecret concealer of all blacke deedes) ſhe conuaide and hid in the hollow trucnk of an old withered oake, ſtanding betwirt two ſteepy hills: where the tracking ſteps of man ſildome treadeth: in which hollow tree, almoſt rotten with age, ſhe ſecretly hid this rich iewell of her ſoule: intombing it therein with theſe ſpeeches: Lie thou there (qurth ſhee) my ſweet gould, thou great

commaunder of mankinde, my deſires content, my earths happines, my heart rauither: by ſeeing thee I am rauiſhed with joy, & in poſſeſſing thee I feede vppon the pleaſures of the world: what is it not but gould can bring to paſſe? gould can purchace kingdomes, and betray Princes: gould can buy preferment, and make men mightie: gould can make the ſmitſh wife, and curb authoritie: gould can win faire Ladies, and wrong the mariage bed: gould can tempt the chaſteſt, and ſack virginitie: nay goulde can change vice into vertue, falſhood into troth and vile villany into pure honeſtie: then be thou ſweet gould my ſecond ſoule, for in looſing thee the world ends with me: in this manner left ſhe this corrupting gould lying in the hollow tree, purpoſing euery day once to feed her eies with the bewitching ſight thereof: bnt now marke what happend to this couetous woman, the next morning by the opening of the daies windows, there came vnto the ſame place where this gould lay, a pooreman, a diſireſſed wretch with a rope in his hand, vppon the ſame tree to end his weariſome life: the reaſon was, that the pittiful cries of his wife and children, complayning for bread at his hands he not being able to ſatiſfie their wants, came thether to hang himſelfe, and ſo by that meanes rid himſelfe from the complayning cries of his poore wife and néedy children, but as the good chaunce of ſmiling heauen was, in tying the roap about an arme or braunch of the ſame tree, making a nooſe to put ouer his head, and in giuing the vnkinde world a dolefull adew, he eſpied this coffer of gould, at which he ſtaid from that ſelfe wild murther, and being ioyfull of ſo rich a purchaſe, left the rope there ſtill hanging, and rarried ried the coffer home, to the comfort of his wife & children: thus you ſee heauen by good meanes, ſand the deare ſoule of this deſperate man, and releeued the diſtreſſed eſtate of his almoſt ſtarued family: which we leaue now in groat ioy, and ſpeake of the wofull calamitte, tyed vppon the backe of this couetous ladie, who imediately after this poore means departure, came vnto the aforeſaide tree to

looke vppon her gould, whereby her heart might leape at the topfull ſight thereof: but no ſooner found ſhe her hopes fruſtrate, her gould gon, and an inſtrument of death left hanging vppon the tree in place thereof, ſhe grew into ſuch a violent diſpaire, that without either care of her liues ſafetie, orpreuention of her ſoules damnation, in the ſame corde ſhe ſtrangleb herſelf: her bodie being thus made breathleſſe, exempted from the ſight of people, had no other buriall but in the rauening mawes of hungerſtarued ſo wies: whoſe ſtraunge confuſion had neuer bin knowne, but through the voice of her troubled ghoaſt, which walked many yeares after betwirt thoſe two hils, and reuealed it to the country inhabitants: thus was her couetouſnes ſcourged for a grieuous ſin, both by heauen and hell.

                  IOuina now the ſubiect of our tragick ſtorie, and fiſt daughter to this inchanted Queene, as fate and chaunce ordained, was matcht in marriage to the rich Cardinall of Lorraine, whoſe court for magnificéce, equallizd and any prelates before his time: for euery day vpriſing and downe lying, he had a thowſand officers in his pallace, and prouiſion for the mainteinance thereof, were the cuſtomes of three riche dukedomes: this haughtie and prowd Cardinall, was in his life ſo vitious, that he accounted drunkennes a deed of manhood: and he that could beſt deuiſe new feruiſes to

pamper vp gluttonie, he aduanced to great authoritie: and his riotous table was accounted the treaſurie of earth, aire and ſea of beaſtes, ſoules and fiſhes: but God owing him a grieueus ſhame, in the middle of his magnificence, when he feaſted at one time in the honour of his greatnes, three chriſtian kings: to the wonder of them all, he was choakt with a grape huske, hapning in a cup of Arabian wine: this his ſodaine death not onely amazed the whole company, but draue ſuch a diſcontent into the minde of Iouina, that ſhe purpoſed a preſent reuenge vpon the whole countrie: and as the cuſtomes of ye natiōns are, that by the death of ſuch an imperious prelate, all the land & reuenews fals from the wife: ſo ſhe to make aſpoile thereof made ſuch a funerall banquet, as Spaines chronicles to this day ſpeaks of for no ſooner had the earth cloſed vp the Cardinalls perfumed bodie, and deliuered the ſame to the fary of conſuming wormes, but this gluttonous woman by ſound of drum and trumpets, cauſed a proclamation to be made throughout all the country, of a free banquet for the ſpace of ſeauen daies, awarding to him or her that could rate or drinke the moſte, a hoepe of pure gould to compaſſe in their bellies: ſhe report of this deadly prize of ſin, being no ſoouer bruted abroad, but of rioters, ſpendthriſts, gluttons, and drunkards, from al parts arriued ſuch numbers, that the walles of Lorraine could hardly conteine them, the tables whereat they ſat were as natures ſtorehouſe, variably yeelding all kinde of delicacies, and their pampred wombes as the inſatiate gulfe of hell neuer ſuffized: ſome there were that had their bellies ſplit in ſunder by ouerfilling them: ſome in the midle of their gluttony choakt with ſuperfluities, ſome by ouercharging themſelues with wine, vomited out their inward partes, and ſome fell into ſuch deadly ſleepes, as they neuer wakened againe and of all theſe multitudes of people, the tenth man departed not away with life, ſo conſuming a tragedie brought this vile déed of gluttonie, and drunkennes vpon that country.

Now Iouina her ſelfe ſeeing the earth almost ſtrewd ouer with ſtifeled carkaſſes began to enuy at the powers of heauen, and in contempt thereof, drew foorth a ſharpe knife, and threw it vp toward the aire, ſaying, I wil wound fate and diſmember the deſtinies, in croſſing thus the glory of my magnificent banquet: but the knife ſhe caſt vp neuer more deſcended, but inſtead thereof fell downe thrée drops of bloud, directly before her vppon the table where ſhe ſat, which ſtrange and diſmall ſight ſtroake terror and remorſe into her conſcience, and ſuch a diſpairing repentance into her cogitations, that from that time forward (as the angry heauens had appointed) ſhe conſumed the remnant of her life (which was but ſhort) in bitter lamentations: Nou blacke vengeance (quoth ſhe) hath doomd me with a thowſand calamities, and the ſcarlet canopie of deſtruction is euen readie to cloſe in my hated life: in moſte vile courſes haue my loathed ſteps wandred in, and now the reward thereof is ſhame & confuſion: me thinks I heare ſuccourles people calling for that food I ſo gluttonouſly haue ſpent: me thinks I heare the vnpittied widdow, and the hungry orphant, challendging my deſtruction: me thinks I hears the decrepit and aged wretches, ſoliciting heauen for reueuge: me thinks I heare the pining priſoners, in deepe dungeons, exclayming againe my riotous gluttony, and me thinks the troubled earth, bellowes vp reuenging ecchoes, againſt my ſinne drowned bodie: thus mourned her relenting tongue, till her vnſtanchable wombe grew as it were ſtarued with hunger, and then ſtriuing to ſuffize nature, could not, for the pipes of her lieus mainten̄ce, were clunged vp, and by the iuſt powers of mortallitie, had a heauier iudgement laide vppon her, for that foode which heauen and nature ordained for her liues ſuſtinance, were congerted into a cōtrary ſnbſtance, her bread heauen changed into ſtoues, her meat into venemous toads, and crawling wormes: and her drinke into a puddle of poyſo ne liquor, the ſtench & ſauour whereof no noſthril could induro:

thus exempted both from heauens grace and earths pittie, ſhe languiſhed many daies, hated of God and man: till the fatall ſiſters finiſhed her weariſome life: this was the heauens ſcourage for gluttonie and drunkennes, as black a ſin and as deadly as any of the ſeauen.

named) what high promotions are heaped vppon hty head: for nature in thy firſt creation, ordained thee to enioy the pleaſures of a princely bedde: though enuious time now burthens thee with flanery, yet fate and good fortune crownes thee with happines: then knowe thou iewell of mine eye, that my boſome containes a heart dauncing at thy preſence, and without the fruition of thy loue, it will quight conſume away: I being a Princeſſe am more hapies then the country milke-maide, for ſhe may challenge that ſame loue that fācy leads her to, but I dare not claime the leaſt intereſt of my pining paſſions: be not hard hearted then deere Antonio, be as gentle as the claſping vine, hem in my bodie with thy manly armes, take the pleaſures of my honours ſacke, feede on content, if content be in my yeelding bodie, for I am impatient of delay: my huſbands armes are like vnto ſhe twinding imbraces of ſerpents, his kiſſes as the crokadils, and his bed more loathſome then a den of ſnakes: oh that nature had made me humble as thy ſelfe, partner in thy fortunes, and thy ſecond ſelfe, either now yeeld to my deſires, or I vow by him that made both heauen and earth, I will purſue thee with a vengeance more terrible, then euer mans icefull heart imagined: and conclude on this, that either continuall happines, or euerlaſting miſery is put vnto thy hearts choyce: now this poore wretch, vnacuſtomed to theſe demaunds, ſtood for a time as one new dropt from the clowdes, not knowing what to reſolue vppon: but at laſt as it were rauiſhed with all celeſtiall bleſſednes, and ſeeing time as he thought fit for euer to make himſelfe happy, by inioying the delightſome ſauours of ſo great a princeſſe, condeſcended to ſatiſfie the deſires of her barning luſt: and according to her pleaſure, with blacke miſdeeds diſtaind the whight honours of her mariage bed: Veneria hauing thus wonne him to her wiſhes, cauſed his bace affires to be ſtripped off and his bodie to be clothed in rich veſtures, the more to feede luſtes gluttonie, and appointed him the next night

to ſet foote within her adulterous bedde, which in moſte wicked manner was accompliſhed: But now marke how ſhame cannot lye long hid, nor the concealer of ſinne (darke night) couer this polluted crime: but as confuſions watchbel ſeunded theſe her diſhonours abroad, through the faithfull beautie of the kings chamber-keepers, he had intelligence thereof: ſo chuſing to himſelfe a ſelected number to effect his reuenge, at the middle hower of night, when nothing diſquieſed the ſleepes of humaine creatures, but the gentle bluſtering of windes, and the muſicall murmurings of running waters: he entred the chamber of this his luſtfull and adulterous queene, who ſecurely lay them ſleeping in the boſome of this bace ſcullion, droue ſuch a rage into the heart of the vnquiet king, as fleſh and blood could hardly indure it: therefore drawing a ſhort ſemiter from his ſide, he ſheathed it in the breaſt of his wiues minion, whoſe blood with ſuch fury guſhed from his poluted boſome, as it wakened the ſinne-ſtained queene, who at the firſt ſight of her huſbands preſence, in her ſmock all to be ſprinckled with the ſcullions blood, fell downe vppon her knees, crauing remiſſion for that crime which ſhe ſo long had thirſted after: but the inraged king to her penitent contrition, was as remorſeles as the deaſe adder, and as far from graunting her life, as the ſoules in hell bee from ſaluation, yet being his ſecond ſelfe, a collop of his owne fleſh, and his ownely mariage choice, he would not desfils his cleare hands with her deteſted blood, therefore as a pining pennance for this luſtfull fact, for this mariage bed ſo diſtaind, for this nuptiall promiſe broken, for this worlds ſcandall, this mariedmans diſhonour, and for this euerlaſting ſpot of diſgrace, he inflicted vppon her a lingring puniſhment, which in this manner was imediately effected: Firſt he cauſed a large coffen to be brought, wherein he put the murthered bodie of the ſcullion: then to the ſame dead bodie, (beginning now to peutrifie and ſtinck) he tyed the liue bodie of his queene, and ſo in the coffen cloſed them vp

both together, that as ſhe inioyd his fellowſhip in life, ſo might ſhe conſume with him being dead, by which meanes the verry wormes that bred vppon the dead carkaſſe, in a manner deuowred vp her liue bodie: and thus were the ſinnes of luſt and adulterie, ſcourged with a plague but fildome heard of.

So vppon an euening, without copmpany ſhe ſtole from the court, guided by the pale light of the moone, and the twinckling ſtar-light of heauen, ſhe happened into a thicke groue of trees, as it were inhabited onely by fayeries, elues, and the ghoaſtes of dead men: day and night there ſeemd all one: the glorious ſunne as a ſtraunger there ſhewd his face, and the voices of humaine creatures were accounted fatall to be there heard: night-rauens, howlats, battes with leather wings, flying griffens and kokatriſes, couered quight ouer

theſe thickets: vpon the ground lay red bellied worms, ſpeckled ſnakes, hiſſing adders, venemous toads, lothſome ſpiders, and ſleeping doremice: ſo that neither heath nor graſſe was there to be ſeene, onely heaps of browne moſſe, vppon the which ſhe reſted her diſcontented bodie: twice twelve moneths without waking ſlept ſhe therevpon, onely fed by the gentle meanes of greene-capt fairies, in which long ſleepe her dreames were of the torments of hell, and the manner of her ſix ſiſters puniſhments in that damned region.
               Firſt in her ſleepe ſhe beheld her eldeſt ſiſter, bearing the name of Pride, attired in a garment boyled in molten lead, with a neckercher about her necke of flaming fire: and her dainty feete ſeemed to walke vppon red burning coals.
               Next, ſhe Beheld her ſecond ſiſter, called Enuy, graſping in her hands a paire of fiery ſtinging ſnakes, which as it were lay feeding vppon her fleſh, euen readie to burſt with the aboundance of blood ſuckt from her boſome.
               Then ſhe beheld her third ſiſter called Wrath wading into a boyling caldron of fire brimſtone, vp to the very chin, and in brazen ladels caſting the ſame vp and downe in great fury.
               Then fixt the her eye vpon her fourth ſiſter named Couetouſnes, feeding on melted gould, and euery part of her bodie behung with burning pearles, ſaphirés & diamonds, which ſeemed to ſeare the verry fleſh from her bones.
               After this ſhe beheld her fiſt ſiſter, which was Gluttony ſitting in a flaming chaire, at a table of red hotte yorne, ſerued by deuils, with broiled loads vppon grid-yorns, and drinking downe challices of boyling mettles.
               The next viſion was her ſixt ſiſter, named Letchery, lying in a bed of ſmoking ſulpher, deliuered of a brood of vipers, who with their fiery teeth fed vppon her bowels, and as it were had her bodie ſpread all ouer with vile leaproſie.
               
                  These were her ſcarefull dreames and continuall apparitions, in which vnquiet ſleepe ſhe remained without waking, till her bodie grew ſhapeles, hauing no proportion, as then made the ſhelter for toads, frogs, and venemous wormes, to breed in the excrements of the earth, and the deformities of nature: thus vanished her life away in ſleepe, being no way able to withſtand the ſcuaere indignation of heauen.
            
            
               
                  
                     Of the inchanted queenes diſpaire; and how ſhe was caried away aliue by deuils.

                  IFter the death of all theſe ſeauen deadly ſiſters, now brought to confuſion by the blacke doome of mortallitie: our tragick ſtory bids vs returne to the inchaunted queene, lying all this while in childbed, fightles and lame, hauing no feeling in any part of her members, which miracle of miſery, after ſhe had intelligence of her ſeauen daughters tragicall ends, aſuredly beleeued that then her life was at the laſt period, and the time of fearefull death drew néere, according to her conditions made to the deuil, who promiſed ſhe ſhould liue till the ſeauen daies of the weeke were forgotten, which ſhe aluded to her ſeauen daughters ſo named: now feare, terror, and pining diſpaire aſſailed her on all ſides: now dreaded ſhe euery minute, her ſoules departure to that burning furnace, whoſe fire is ten times more hotte then this earthly fire, and now euery ſmall noiſe ſhe heard, ſhe ſuppoſed, to be the hurring of deuils that came to take poſſeſſion both of ſoule and bodie: euery minute wiſhed ſhe now to be whole yeares, howers, millions and daies endles,

time to ſtand ſtill, or the world to end: now ſhe repented her ambition, her aſpiring dignities, and all thoſe deſires of a kingdome: now repented ſhe the ſelling of her ſoule: her bands ſealing with her owne blood, and all her agreements with blacke hell: euery time the clocke ſtruck put her in minde of eternall damnation, and how that hels gaping mouth ſtood readie to receiue her: curſing the begetters and cauſers of her creation: thus in deepe remorſe of conſcience, ſuent ſhe out the tireſome day, the laſt day of her worldly life, till the clowdy euening with her pitchy manlie aproached, the onely comparatiue of gloomy hell, the which had no ſooner ſhut vp the bright eye of heauen, but clowdes more darke then darknes itſelfe, checked the world with motions of pale death: ſuch tempeſts of lightning and thunder, broake from heauens chriſtall portalls, that it euen blaſted the beautie of the earth, and atired both trees, hearbes, and flowers, in a mournfull liuery: this night ſo al mankind was a night of feare, a night of relentles terror, a night of confuſed deſolation, in which extremitie of horror it continued till the mid-nights hower, at which inſtant time with a clamorous roaring, that ſeemd to ſhake both heauen and earth, the wrathfull powers of blacke hell, fetcht away both her bodie and ſoule: the which being done, the heaues cleared, the earth repleniſhed, and after followed a time of plentie, peace and proſperitie.
