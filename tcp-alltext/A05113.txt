            Mr HENRY BARROWES PLATFORM. Which may serve, as a Preparative to purge away Prelatisme: with some other parts of Poperie. Made ready to be sent from Miles Mickle-bound to Much-beloved-England. Togither with some other memorable things. And, A familiar Dialogue, in and with the which, all the severall matters conteyned in this booke, are set forth and interlaced. After the untimely death of the penman of the foresaid Platforme & his fellow prisoner; who being constant witnesses in points apperteyning to the true worship of God, and right government of his Church, sealed up their testimony with their bloud: And paciently suffred the stopping of their breath, for their love to the LORD.

            To such as are already true Christians, and all that desire so to be; health & salutation, in the Authour of salvation.
            THis Conference or Discourse between Desiderius and my self: Togither with other things of excellent argument, (worthily beloved,) vvas for your sakes (by our mutual consent) put to printing. Reape therefore the benefite thereof, and defend it from the unjust cavils of all that set against the same. And for the literall faults therein, amend with the pen I pray you, as they are espied in the reading. And if in the materials, all thinges hang not well togeither in your sense, consider them better by the word of God, and what agreeth therwith, cast not away; neither receive any thing that dissenteth therefrom. But try all things, and keepe that which is good.

            Which haue not seen what thou canst to them show,
            And what thou speakst is meete for all to know:
            Who would discern some things amiss that bee,
            Within the Land of our Nativitee:
            To such thou shalt be iudged wondrous kinde,
            Because thou canst right well informe their minde:
            In such a sort as they shall bettred bee,
            And well advantag'd by the things in thee.
            Yet foes enough thou shalt be sure to finde,
            'Mong Priests that have the soules of many pinde:
            And Prelates too, which very seldome preach,
            Or suffer those that carefully would teach
            Gods truth, and give Christs sheep their wholsome food,
            All such Restreyners make the sinfull brood.
            And of that Ranck not one of them is found,
            That feeds the flock in wholsome pasture ground.
            If such bring food, they poison give withall,
            Which proveth worse then wormwood mixt with gall.
            They suffer not the milk of Gods word pure,
            To work vpon the soules of men a cure:
            Though sincere milk therof, that some is it,
            Which makes for God the soule of each man fit.
            And thou directs them in no other wise,
            Nor wouldst haue any follow such mens guise;
            As will not to that wholsome Word bend care,
            And all his pathes unto Iehovahs seare.
         
      
      
         
            
            A Dialogue or Discourse, passing betweene Desiderius and Miles Micklebound, by occasion of their old love and new meeting.
            
               Miles Micklebound.
               RIght glad am I to see you Desiderius: but who ever would haue thought to haue met you here in these partes? Some great & weighty cause doubtlesse hath occasioned you to come hither. But I praye tell me, how doe all our friends in England, and what good newes bring you from thence?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               It may be thought a wonder to see your selfe here (my much beloved Miles
                  ▪) for it was reported that you were at Rome, that you were the Popes scholer, &c. But I am glad to see you so farre from his citie of seven hills, where his seat is. And that putts mee in better hope concerning you then others have.
            
            
               Miles
               For certayn Desiderius, I am and alwaies have been, furder off and more opposi
                     •
                  e to the Popes religion and learning, then now distant frō his citie and seate, where I never

yet came not purpose to come, vnlesse I should happen to long for fyre and fagot.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               That increaseth my hope, & to bring like joy unto your selfe, know this, that our friends in England are generally well, as I see you are, whereof I am not a litle joyeux.
            
            
               Miles.
               And how goes it with religion? Are there not good hopes for reformation?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               The hopes that way, are as fewe & small as ever they were; Howbeit that which you call reformation, others doe count deformation.
            
            
               Miles.
               But how then is it with the Prelats, Are they so proud; or doe they dominiere & beare like sway as heretofore?
            
            
               Desid.
               Yea doubtlesse. For there are none that are put down more then the Puritans (as they are called,) nor none that rise up faster then the Prelates, as you call them.
            
            
               Miles.
               Then in deed there can be no present hope, for Bishops and the abuses brought in by them, are a bane to the beawtie of true religion, and doe greatly hinder all sound and sincere walking therein.
            
            
               Desider.
               Multitudes are otherwise minded then you are, and many wiser then I doe think them to be the very pillars of the Church, and chiefe upholders of true religion. And what should I then think of the matter?
            
            
               Miles.
               Not as the multitude doe, for then

you think erroneously. And if these be the pillars or propps of any Church, it must needs be the church of Antichrist. For wee finde no warrant in all the scriptures, that their offices, callings or administrations, haue any place, power or right in the Church of Christ, as shal plainly appeare hereafter. But where you seem to let your judgment rely upō the multitude, and to approve of that which wiser then your self doe justify; you are taught not to follow a multitude to doe evill, Exod. 23. And the divine proverbe sheweth, that it is as great an evil to justify the wicked as to condemne the innocent. But, as woe is pronounced to him that calls good evil; so likewise to him that cal leth evil good. Esa. 5.29. For your judgeing of matters in case of religion, you ought to look to the lawe and word of God, and not to the wisdome of man. For the wisdome of the wise men of this world is foolishnes with God, and the wisdome of God is foolishnes with them. The Philosophers and other wise men, could never by their worldly wisdome atteyne to the right knowledge of God & heavenly things. This apperteyneth to the foolish things of the world, which God hath chosen to confound the wise. As sayth the Apostle, 1 Cor. 1. Read the whole chapter at your leasure, for your better information. But I pray you how sayd you that it was with the Puritans?
            
            
               
               Desiderius.
               I observe that there are none more detest

               Miles.
               It is then with the Bishops according to the old proverbe, evil weeds doe growe apace. And Mr. Tindall in the practise of Prelates, shewe

                  sseth the oake, and groweth up about it, till it is higher then he oake it self; so doth the Prelates with their Princes. Hereof wee haue seen lamentable experience in the papacie. For the Bishop of Rome hath gotten himself aloft, advauncing himself above the trees, as it is in Iothams parable, Iudg. 9.7. &c. that is, above Princes, even Kings and Emperors, whō he makes his vassals and kissers of his feete. We

God grant that such presidents may be a warning for all Kings and Princes to keep downe such climers, while power is in their hand to restraine their unnaturall growth. But is it not to now, that the Arch Bishops grace is come to the Title of a Prince, and President in the

Right honourable privie counsell? And are not also the inferiour Bishops invested with the stile of Barons and Peeres of the Realme? Which titles and authorities are in deed fit for Peeres and Magistrates in the common wealth, not for ministers of the Church, but is forbidden unto them in the sacred Scriptures. And yet such titles doe men give, and these Bishops presume to take notwithstāding. And that, not as they are imployed in civil affaires; but, as they are ministers and spiritual men; and are therefore called spiritual Lordes, even as the others (truely honourable) are called the Lords temporall, and are so distinguished one from another. The abuse ought to be much lam

                  nted and utterly abandoned. And these are of that broode which the learned linguist Mr. Hugh Broughton usually calleth the banned Bishops. But tell m
                     •
                   how doe they now behave themselves in their usurped authorities?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               It may be answered, That that is not usurped which is given. But Princes doe give them their authoritie. Therefore they usurp it not.
            
            
               Miles.
               If the Prince of princes hath not given it them but forbidden it, they are usurpers; & the donation of earthly princes cannot make them to be otherwise; seing it is unlawfull for the one to give, & for the other to receive

such authorities and titles. But you answer not my demand, how they behave themselves therein?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               They imprison, put to silence, & degrade at their owne pleasure, and (to speak the trueth, they) stand more upon the observation of their ovvne unholy ceremonies, then upon Gods most holy oracles. And all that refuse to bovv, they vvill bend; till they break the back of their conscience. So that I see no end of their evills, neither can I dive into their doings, for a suteable discoverie, vvithout much sorovve of heart.
            
            
               Miles
               When Iohn Baptist sent Disciples unto Iesus to ask him whether he vvas he that should come, or vvhether vve should look for another? Our Saviour ansvvered, Goe and tell Iohn, what thinges ye heare and see. The blinde receive sigh

                      and the halt walk: the leapers are cleansed, and the deafe heare. the dead are raysed up, and the poore receive the Gospell. Math 11.4 5.6 &c. Novv these being the vvorks that the true Christ should doe, & Iesus doeing them, Iohn knevv and taught his disciples to knovv, that that vvas in deed the very Christ promised. Even so those vvorks that you say the Bishops doe, being the vvorks of Antichrist; doe tell & reach that these Bishops are truely Antichristian. And the discoverie of their doings hath been sufficiently performed heretofore by

sundry persons & in divers manners: by some merily, by some modestly, by some gravely, all soundly. Therefore take you no care for that service, neyther let any be dismayed for their loftynes & tyrannicall cariages. A lofty sayle with great vvindes vvill soone break dovvne a rotten mast. And the higher the Bishops climbe, the nearer they are to their fall, & the greater shall it be. Yea vvho can tell hovv soon the vvindes of Gods vvrath shall blovv upon them, against vvhich they shall not stand. The Axe of Gods vvorde is ready hastily to hevv them dovvn, did not humane authoritie hinder the stroke of it to support the Lordlynes of these Prelates for a season. But vvhen the time is come vvhich the Highest hath set, humane authoritie shall no longer hinder, but help to further Gods vvork. As it vvas in the dayes of Cyrus King of Persia, vvhen the deliv

Thus might they bothe please God in doeing his will, and put away from themselves all danger and dread which continually do compasse them whiles they are ledd by such guides.

For touching the Ministerie of Arch and Lordbishops aforementioned, with other ministeries under them: That their offices were never appointed by Christ, but is a new ministerie devised by man, both in their office, entrance, administration and maintenance, and ought not

therefore to be continued; the scriptures haue shewed such light as haue filled our land full of proofe

Also the holy Martyrs and writers old and new haue condemned them. Mr Chadderton of Emmanuel Colledge in Cambridge hath truely taught and confidently affirmed, in his Sermon on Rom. 12. That the Church (speaking of the Church of England) abhorreth and loatheth the things which are abounding in her; as namely Ach Bishops, Lord Bishops, Deanes, Arch Deacons, Chancellors, Commissaries, Officials, and all such as are rather mē
                     bers and parts of the whore and strumpet of Rome, then of the pure virgine and spouse of the immaculate lambe. Therfore (saith hee) shee will have these (if they will needs bee of her body) to shewe that they be created of God, and united unto her by Christ her head. If they will needs be of the heavenly Ierusalem, let them shew that they came downe from heaven, and who gave them from thence. For the Apostles never knew them. Sion hath not heard of them. Ierusalem which is above will not acknowledge them. The watchmen (no doubt) being a sleepe, they haue crept into the citie of the Lord. But now they are espied, now the church complaineth of them, both because they haue no title nor interest in it as publike mēbers: As also because of the length of their unlawfull swords they keepe out the lawfull members of the body.

                  The foresayd Christians called Brownists, whom I finde very sound in these things, have in their Apologie pag. 50. prooved by 8. good Reasons, That the Hierarchy & Ministerie of Popes, Archbishops, Lordbishops, Suffragans, Deanes, Archdeacons are Antichristian. And then by 12. sufficient Reasons moe, doe proove that the Hierarchy and Ministerie aforesayd, may not be set over the Church of Christ; nor reteyned therein. For which I refer you to the said Apology, which you may procure amongst the people of that profession at London, or else where. It were tedious to tell the names of all the writers against the foresayd Hierarchy and Ministerie of Archbishops and the rest of that rable: but endlesse to set downe all that is written concerning them and their princelynes. I will here onely insert a few moe testimonies of the ministers themselves, who being of one church with the chiefe ministers their own masters, may better be credited against them, then mere opposites which are not of them, but separated from them. And first for Henoch Clapham who in ans. to the Bishops Arguments sayth, in the 2. section of the 2. part of his Survey of the Church.
               Their cock sure Argument (as they take it) is this; Christ promised to be with his Apostles vnto the end of the world at the giving of the commission, Mat. 28. 19.20. And Timothee is charged to keepe the commandement pure vnto the coming of Christ: But none of those persons should live unto the end. Therefore he spake to some other in

their persons, who must be as were the Apostles and E
                        •
                     angelists Lords over Pastors & Churches. And who should these be but such Lord Bishops as themselves who haue and occupy jurisdiction & power over all the Churches and ministers of England.
               If this be true that our Bishops be Apostles (for if the successors should have had an other name the scripture would haue registred it) If I say they be Apostles, then England hath not dignified them truely, in saying, The Lord Bishop of such a place, who rather should haue sayd, My Lord Apostle of London, My Lord Apostle of Lincolne: Even as it was sayd, Peter the Apostle of the circumcision, and Paul the Apostle of the gentiles. Then likewise England should for that great blessing haue been more bound to praise God, she having more Lord Apostles of her owne, then was in the whole world unto Christ, who sent forth so fewe as twelve, & Paul with Barnabas. They being for the most part men of occupations, but these being men of state and stately Lords. But before we admit them for Apostles let us compare them with Christs. The first were elected and ordeyned to their office, eyther by Christ the head, or togither by some particular Church: But these eyther by A Prince or by the Cannons of that sea confirmed by an Archbishop.
               Secondly, they were appointed to office to the end they might feede feede feed the Lords sheepe. But our English ones, are appointed to their roomes in their old age to the end they may nowe (togither

with the Levites of 50. yeres of age) rest their bones and feed their owne bellies.
               Thirdly, the first were tyed to no one sea, but were sent to teach all nations: These keepe themselves within a stinted compasse, teaching fewe or none once in a long time.
               Fourthly the Apostles of Christ could not discharge their work but by comming through many wants; These of our land may discharge their work by leaning on their elbowes in the middst of their Lordly platters.
               Fiftly, the first were appointed to gather churches and establish all holy order. As for these, not one of them ever gathered a church, but haue kept many in disorder.
               Sixtly the first had attending on them (for the furtherance of their Apostolical work) blessed Euangelists and preaching Disciples. These latter haue first a company of ruffling Chaplaines that can handle cardes and dice well, secondly a company of swash-rutting serviters that can teach all the parish to sweare and weare all foolish fashioned apparel.
               Seventhly, the first were plain simple harted Ministers. These are Lords in name, Lords in living, Lords in pompe, Lords checkmate with the nobleest Peere of our Realme.
               Eightly the first were brought before lordly ri

               Ninthly the first established wise godly Elders in every cōgregatiō: These establish dumb dogs & greedy hogges in their parishes & confused assemblies.
               Tenthly, the Apostle Paul upbraided the Church of Corinthe for not exercising the power of our Lord Iesus committed unto her in delivering up the incestuous to Satan. These Bishops are not so foolish, but haue got all the power into their own hāds, sending that latin burbolte our of their unholy court.
               Eleventhly, the first sought no kingdome here, because they lookt elswhere to sit on a throne with Iesus: But these so seek kingdome & establish their houses here, as if they were of minde with the governor of the feast in Cana of Galilee that sweet wine is best at the first.
               Twelvethly, the Apostles of Christ were the chosen penmen of the holy Ghost, and therefore their writings are of sufficient credite in themselves and canonicall: As for our English-ones, God never chose them for such purpose, and therefore their writings which are almost none, and their sermons which are almost as fewe, are to be suspected, and to come under examination.
               Lastly to give 13. to the dozen, the Apostle Paul did think, they were set forth the last Apostles, 1 Cor. 4.9. These men come more then XV. hundred

yeres after that they were Apostles. Likewi

And againe in the same book p. 123. speaking of their offices he saith, Our kinde of Bishops, the Commissaries, the Archdeacons and such like, we account them no naturall members of the body of Christs Church because they are of humane addition, not borne with

Yea that the Arch Bishops office, is the weck of the popish Hierarchy, come out of the bottomles pit of hell.

As for extraordinarie, the Prelates were not knowen, when they were in the world: besides that they are as unlike them as darknes is to light.

               Finally, all the seekers of Reformation, haue in the Admonition to the Parl. 2. treatise: sect. 14.18.20. professed, that the Names and offices of Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops &c. are togither with their government drawen out of the Popes shop, Antichristian, Divilish and contrary to the scriptures: That the Parsons, Vicars,

And now I would I were as wel able as willing to make sute to the higher powers that by their lawfull authoritie, the unlawfull offices & jurisdictions of the Prelates might be abolished.

And as for all such idolatrous livings, they ought in every Countrey, by the Magistrates of the same to be converted to civil uses: wherein how much the more that charitie is respected, so much the more shall God therein be honoured. All such livings are of the stollen goods which Antichrist hath purloigned from the common wealth & civil estates of people, to inriche his Clergie vvithall: and for supporting of his other abominations. So as such goods and livings cannot rightly be imployed till they be converted

you think to beg these idolatrous livings from the Prelates to the Preachers, your suite is not worth the suing for, neyther will God be pleased therewith. The preachers that will depend upon God & follow his word are to haue their wants supplied otherwise, as is abovesayd. But thus though you seeme to forsake the errour that you were in about the Bishops office, yet you are in an other errour about their livings, which you think ought to be for other Ministers. And herein I will put my selfe to new paines to informe you better.

               Wee haue lately heard a Bell sound, that it is a just judgement of God, upon K. Henry the 8. that there is not one of his posteritie left to sit upon his throne, for bereaving the Church of the Gleabes, Abby lands &c. and imploying them to other uses. And how then shall the taking away of the Bishops livings from the Clergy to the laitie, from the service of God in the Church, to the service of the common wealth; be esteemed lesse then a sinfull and sacrilegious act?
            
            
               Miles.
               Such Bells (as you speak of) that sound so badly, deserve well to loose their clappers, or to be hung out of all mens hearing. For the work of that worthy King, in suppressing those Abbyes, Frieries, Nunneries and the Vermine living in them, was all within the limits of his office and duetie, as was also the converting of those livings to his own or other civil uses. In which, the more he respected the glory of God and charitie, the more worthy

was his work, and deserved the higher praise even as those Kings and Princes shall doe whom God vvill imploy as his instruments, for rooting out the remnant of that race, the Arch and Lord Bishops, with a number of false functions, and anti christian offices under them, and converting o

                   their livings likewise to civil uses. For these livings and ecclesiasticall offices and Ministeries mainteyned by them, haue no better fundation then had the other. And these that yet remaine, are (of a trueth) brethren of the same broode, and byrdes of the same fether; had the same Syre, and were all hatched after the same fashiō with the former, that are driven avvay.

And the nearer that men come unto God, the greater in his sight are the sinnes that they commit. Therfore the Priests in Israel offered greater sacrifices for their sinnes, then ordinary Israelites

that fel into the same. Therfore also, judgement first beginneth at the house of God, &c. Now as all Churches in the vvorld are bound to receive such Ministeries onely as God hath appointed and none other; so vvhosoever doe institute, appointe,

Therefore your plea is nothing vvorth, save against your self & our church of England, if it be (as you hold it) a true Church.

               I pray you let me ask you, what difference you put between the Israelites sinne in worshipping the calves, or God by the calves, as they pretended: and the papists sin in worshipping their images, or (as they would haue it,) God by their images?
            
            
               Miles.
               I see in that small difference, for Israel was then a false church though it had been of the true. And the heape of papists are likewise a false church, though the Church of Rome before time was true. And whether men make the images of calves or of other creatures, for any worship to God

they are all inventions of men, the workes of their

               But you haue not alwayes been of this minde, that such livings ought not of right to apperteyne to the ministerie of the Gospell. Neverthelesse if you haue seene a further light by the opposers of Prelatisme abroade, then you had at home, it would be good to make your friends and countrey partakers therof.
            
            
               Miles.
               Very gladly shall I doe that. But first you are to observe this for your selfe, that the holy Martyrs and witnesses of Christ were of this minde long before me, as I haue shewed and could shewe yet further if need require. And for that I haue not alwayes been of this minde, it is sufficient that I came vnto it when God gaue me meanes to see that

it was the minde of his High Majestie, wherunto & all men ought to conforme our selves. The Apostle Paul was not alwayes of the minde that Iesus o

                   Nazaret was the Christ: But some while he persecuted such as professed him, til he saw otherwise. And then he became a preacher of the same trueth both abroade and in bands unto the death. And eve

                   so Lord Iesus just and righteous, give me constancy in witnessing this part of thy truth against the Prelates, their offices, entrance, administrations, manner of maintenance and large jurisdictions, all which are unlawfull and contrary to the scriptures. As for your desire or hope of help from abroade; I could wish you rather to turne your eyes another way, and look nearer home. For I am perswaded that there are not greater meanes of helpe to be found in the world for this service, then God hath raised up, in and unto our owne land, of the true borne subjects and naturall children thereof. And that both of the forwarder sort of Ministers, and learned men in our Church of England, as also, and more specially of the people called Brownists; who by their diligence in the scriptures and advantage of their cause, are most strongly furnished against the Prelates, against their Antichristian jurisdictions, and Lordly livings &c. At whose handes if helpe were sought, espetially of the learned among them, great helpe might be had.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               And may not the like helpes be had from the Anabaptists also? for they are likewise very

opposite to the Bishops.
            
            
               Miles.
               They are so. And to give them their due, many of them are very honest men with all; but yet they disadvantage themselves sundry wayes. First, by their hereticall opinions. 2. Because they haue, approve and allow, of generall Bishops, for baptising, &c. in all their assemblies; at least, in so many of them as hold one societie, and are of one cō
                  munion. And so what they condemne and cast downe in others, they (after a sort) doe justifie and hold up in thēselves, by their owne practise. But the practise & professiō of the other (mistermed ones) accordeth in one, and strengtheneth one another.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               I am glad you conceipt the wayes of the Anabaptists no better. For I had you in some jealousie concerning them. But it is sorow enough that you preferre the Brownists before our forward Ministers.
            
            
               Miles.
               I haue good reason in this case so to doe. For as they hold it unlawfull for our Ministers of Englād, to haue those idolarrous livings aforesaid, so they hold it unlawfull for their owne, and all other ministeries to haue them; but would that they were returned againe to the Common-wealth from whence they were taken. But our forward Ministers, that with the Prelates downe, and their livings to be taken from them, would gladly haue them for their owne use, as you likewise pleaded for them. And I feare they hold it no better then sacrilege if they be otherwise imployed. Whereof your owne

selfe also made question a litle before. But to speak the trueth without respect of persons and to flatter with none, these things in thern are meere trifling, if not also hypocrisie, arising of covetousnes. For if they be lawfull for themselves, they are lawfull for the superior Ministers also, by vvhom these inferior ones were made. If they say nay; For their inferior Ministerie is a true Ministerie; but the Lordly Ministerie is not so: therfore these livings belong unto them and not to their Lords. Herein they deceive themselves, but let them not deceive you nor others. For seing the inferiour Ministerie is derived from and made by the superiour; eyther then the superiour ministerie must be true, or these of their making cannot be true. But the other being false that maketh, these must needs bee false that are made by them. For every creature bringeth forth according to his owne kinde, whether it be man, or byrds or beasts, whether cleane or uncleane. And if the roote be holy, so are the branches: But if the roote be corrupt and impure, the branches must needs be so likewise. Adam and Eve corrupted, brought forth a man in their owne likenes, that is▪ one corrupted like themselves. But I can shewe you divers wayes whereby you may discerne, that the Brownists (a
                     •
                   you call them) are the best Champions to fight this battel, and are most likely to win the field.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               I cannot tell. I am sure they are counted a s

                  ct, and are every where evil spoken of.
            
            
               
               Miles.
               But the question is, whether it is for evil doing, or for weldoing? If for well doing, they are 
                     •
                  o beare it paciently as partakers of the crosse and suffrings of Christ, whose faithfull servants and witnesses of old, even in the Apostles dayes were counted a sect likewise, even the sect of the Nazarites, and were every where evill spoken of in like sorte. But did it therefore follow that they were according to the report & esteem that was amongst men concerning them? Or should men therefore haue rejected them, or any good thing among them? Let it be farre from you so to think, and further off in that sort to speake, eyther of those former, or yet of these later Christians. Christ himself was the chiefe corner stone, vvhom the builders refused, yet he became the head of the corner. And surely these me vvhich you and others are ready enough to refuse for helpe in this service, are the most sound & sufficient of any that I knowe for convicting of our common adversaries and terrible opposites the Prelates and loftie Clergy of the land. Wherfore I would advise you and all, never to shunne, but diligently to seeke, & thankfully to receive their helpe when it may be had. And if we see them to erre in any other thing (as all men are subject to errour)

               Therein you say well. But where you charge the Anabaptists with hereticall opinions, (& true it

is that such they hold) I praye you how much better is it with the Brownists? They condemn (as the report goes) not onely the best people of the land: but also condemne and forsake the faith professed and mainteyned there, counting it the faith of the Divils, and professing another faith for themselves. Now for my owne part, I am not onely perswaded, but fully assured through the mercie of God, that the faith professed in England is the true saving faith of Gods elect, and if ever they be saved themselves, it must be through the same faith in Christ. Therefore if they be guilty of that report, my soule shall haue no pleasure in them, till they returne by repentance. For, to erre in that pointe is a matter of no small importance.
            
            
               Miles.
               That report is eyther a mere slander, raised up by the Divil in his instruments for the disgrace of their cause, or if ever it was spoken by any of them, it must be some one very simple, that erreth therin through ignorance; or some that are strongly carried with zeale against the false & confused order of that Church; and not distinguishing b

                  tweene order and faith, may happen through hast or incōsideratenes to call the one by the name of the other. And so when they speake of the impure faith of the Church of England, may intend onely the impure and corrupt order that is therin.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               If you had not holpen with such a lift, they had lien under it for me. But sure such zeal is preposterous zeale, and such inconsideratenes, is

               Be it so. Yet can you not justly impute that to a whole company which is done by one or two, when the rest doe not approve it, but are against it. And there is no religion wherein there are not some that miscarie themselves, eyther through zeale, or ignorance, or else in headie, rash and inconsiderate speech. Yet such as so offend among these, are liable to the rebuke of their Presbyterie and Church it self, if the cafe so require. And the maine difference between them and England, is about outward orders and ordinances, and the faith professed by both, is one and the same. And concerning the matter of heresie, they never were not can be convicted therof. And when they sent their confession of faith to the Reverend learned man M. Francis Iunius, desiring him if he sawe them to erre in any thing, to shewe it unto them: He vouchsafed to write and send them a friendly and brotherly answer: But declared no errour nor heresie in all that they wrote unto him.

Apology & calling upon thē by many reasons for proofe of their accusations, they reply to Puritans & Papists, but doe let these alone unanswered: & for what cause, wise men may easily conjecture.
               And now Desiderius, that you may the better perceive that they hold the same faith with us in Engl. & what their difference from us in other things is, heare what themselves haue professed and printed. In the Preface of their Confessiō of Faith, thus they write. And further we testifie by these presents unto all men, and desire them to take knowledge hereof, that we have not forsaken any one point of the true Auncient Catholike & Apostolike faith professed in our land: but hold the same grounds of Christian religion with them still, agreeing likewise herein, with the Dutch, Scottish, Germane, Frēch, Helvetian, and all other Christian reformed Churches round about us, whose Confessions published, we call to witnes our agreement with them, in matters of greatest moment, being conferred with these Articles of our Faith following. The things then onely against which we contend, and which we mislike, in the English parish assemblies, are many reliques of the man of synne (whom they pretend to have abandoned) yet reteyned among them, and with a high hand mainteyned, upholden, and impos

               And Mr Henry Barrowe one of their writers, in a letter of his sent unto a Right honourable Lady, & published in their Apology, concerning this pointe sayth, That he did gadly imbrace and beleeve the common faith received and professed in the land, as most holy and s

               Desiderius.
               If the rest of them be like him, then are they not so uncharitable in their judging of our people, as some men say they are.
            
            
               Miles.
               They generally put difference betweene all good mens Church estate, as they are under the ordinances of Antichrist, and their personall estate, indued with many heavenly and holy graces. Therefore open not your eares too wide in hearing reports, for many that are giuen out against them, are surely false. But heare a litle further vvhat themselves doe professe. Mr Barrow in his writing intituled a fewe observations to the reader of M. Giffords last reply, s. 4. saith thus. Haue we not commended, the faith of the English Martyrs, and deemed them saved, notwithstanding the false offices and great corruptions in the worship they exercised, not doubting but the mercy of God, through their sincere faith to Iesus Christ extended and superabounded all their sinnes seen and vnseene. And what now should let, that we should not haue the same hope, where the same precious faith in sinceritie and simplicity is found? So that they neyther neglect to search out the truth, nor despise the truth when they see it, &c. And this he further cleareth in the same section.
               Mr Iohn Penrie likevvise, in his Examinatiō hath these vvords, For I know the doctrine touching the holy

Trinitie; Nature, and Offices of the Lord Iesus; Free justification by him; both the sacraments &c. published by her Majesties authoritie and commanded by her lawes▪ to be the Lords blessed and undoubted truthes, without the knowledg and profession wherof no salvation is to be had. And sheweth the things that he disliketh, and for vvhat cause he durst not partake in the publik assemblies of our land, notwithstanding the former truthes there taught and professed.
               And againe in his Confession of faith he sayth, The trueth of doctrine touching the holy Trinitie, touching the natures and Offices of Christ▪ Iustifying faith, Sacraments and Eternall life, and the rest, established by her Majesties Lawes, and professed by her self, their Honours, and such as have knowledge in the assemblies of this land: I acknowledge from my heart to be such, as if I mainteyned not the unitie, and held not the communion of the same doctrine with them in these points, I could not possibly be saved: For out of the communion of the true profession, which her Majestie hath established in these and the like truthes, there is no hope of salvation left: But ioyne notwithstanding in the publike assembles of this Land, I dare not, for the former causes.
               
               
                  I doe moreover willingly confesse, that many, both of the Teachers, and also of the Professors within these Parish assemblies, haue so imbraced this trueth of doctrine, established and professed in this Land, as the Lord of his infinite goodnes, hath granted them the favour, to show outwardly many tokens, wherby (in regard of the Lords election) I professe before men and Angels, that I judge them to be mē

               And whereas Mr Iacob would father upon this people, that they hold every person in England which holdeth the publick faith, is no true Christian. Mr Iohnson in his answer, pag. 7. sayth thus; Touching this point, I minde the state of their people two wayes: the one concerning their severall persons considered a part from the constitution of your Church; the other concerning their estate and standing in that constitution. Concerning the former of these, (that is, considering them a part from the cō
                     stitution) I acknowledge that in divers of them there appeareth such knowledge and faith of the Gospell with the fruits thereof, as they may well be thought▪ in regard of Gods election in Christ, to be heires of salvation, and in that respect to be true Christians: God pardoning unto them their standing under Antichrist, which they doe not see or minde. But I seare least many more were heretofore partaker of this grace then be now since your Antichristian estate and the unlawfulnes to a

                      faith and multitude of Antichristian abhominations withall they cannot by the word of God be judged true Christians, as touching their outward estate in that Church of yours: but stand all subject to wrath, God imputing this their sinne unto them. And that all therfore whosoever willbe assured of Gods mercie

and salvation, ought with speed to goe out of your Church, it still remayning in Antichristian estate. &c.
               Thus Desiderius, I haue shewed you what divers of them haue written and professed in and about the point by you objected: & if it be not sufficient I will shew you more.
            
            
               Desiderius.

               Miles.
               And for that cause I was the more large: As also that (when these things are published) others at home & abroad may likevvise receive satisfaction. And if any of the people themselves have been so overseen, as to speak according to the report that you heard, they may (by this meanes) be againe brought to their owne grounds, which some through simplenes, rashnes, or incōsideratenes may forget, & offend against the same: But the more circumspect and wise, are more considerate and wary. Thus being somewhat weary, I will rest from discoursing a while; and in the meane time, you may read these three writings which will be worth your paines and the printing. And they also will cleare that people and the truth, from such clamours as you haue heard concerning thē.

                        Delivered to Mr Wood a Scottish preacher in Ireland, anno 1594.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              The humble, most earnest, and lamentable Complaint & Supplication of the persecuted & proscribed Church and servants of CHRIST, falsely called Brownists, Vnto the high Court of Parliament.
                              THe most high GOD, possessor of heaven and earth, bringeth at this present before your Lordships and Wisdomes (Right Honourable) his owne Cause, his owne People, his owne sworne and most trecherous Enemies, togither with the most shamefull usage of his truth and servants, that ever hath been heard of in the dayes of Sions professed peace and tranquility.
                              His Cause and People he offereth unto your confideration and defence, in our Profession and Persons: His Enimies and their outrage against his truth and servants, in the persons & bloody proceedings of the Prelates of this Land and their Complices.
                              Wee profosse the same faith and truth of the Gospell, which her Majestie, which your Honours, this whole Land, and all the reformed Churches under Heaven this day doe holde and mainteyne. Wee goe beyond them (being our onely fault, even in the judgement of our tyrannicall and most savage Enimies) in the detestation of all Popery, that most fearfull Antichristian Religion▪ and draw nearer in some pointsby our practise unto CHRISTS holy order and institution. This is our Faith, this is our Cause (right Honourable) yea the Lords Cause in our

sinfull hands.
                              For the profession & maintenance of which Faith, the forenamed Enemies of GOD deteyne in their hands within the Prisons about London (not to speak of other Gaoles throughout the Land) about three score & twelve persons, Men, woemen, yong and old, lying in cold, in hunger, in dungeons and in yrons. Of which number they haue taken the Lords day last, being the 3. of this 4. Moneth, 1592. about some 56. persons, hearing the word of God truly taught, praying & praysing God for his favors shewed unto us, unto her Majestie, your Honours, and this whole Land; and desiring our God to be mercyfull to us, unto our gracious Prince, & countrey. Being imployed in these holy actions, and no other (as the parties who disturbed them can testifie) they were taken in the very place where the persecuted Church and Martyrs were enforced to use the like exercises in Queene Maries dayes.
                              The former number are now unbaleably cōmitted by the Prelate or Bishop of London unto close (for the most part) severall prysons; As Bryde-well, the Lymboe or Dungeon in Newgate; the Feete, the Marshalsee; the Counters; the Clyncke; the Gatehouse; the Wotte-Lyon &c. Wherein wee willingly acknowledge the lott and inheritance in this life of our Fore-Fathers and Brethren, the holy Martyres of the former age, and the entayled A

Well heere our brethren lye (how long Lord holy and true thou knowest) in Dungeons, in hunger, in colde, in nakednes, and all outward distresse; For these bloody men will allow them neyther meat, drink, fyre, lodging, nor suffer any whose harts the Lord would stirre up for their releife to haue any accesse unto them: purposing belike to imprison them unto death, as they haue done 17. or 18. others in the same poisome Gaoles within these 6. yeeres.

Some of this company had not one penye about them when they were sent into close prison, nor any thing being abroad (which is the case of the most of them, if not all) to procure themselves and their poore families any maintenance, save onely their handly labours and trades. Whereby it is come to passe that these Enimies of God doe not onely starve and undooe a number of men in the prisons, but even a lamen

But their dealing this way towards us is so woefull right Honourable as we may truely demand with grief of heart, whether the forreigne Enemie, or our native Countrey men doe possesse and beare rule over us in our deare and native countrey.
                              Their whole dealing herein is most barbarous, most inhumane, but specially most unchristian; and such as exceedeth the crueltie of the heathen and popish professed Tyrants and Persecutors. The records of the heathen persecution under Nero, T

                                  with Iesus Christ and his servants▪ Bishop Bonner, Story, Weston dealt not after this sort: For those whom they cōmitted close, they would also eyther feed, or permit to be fed by others, and they brought them in short space openly unto Smithfield, to end their miserie & to begin their never ending joye. Whereas Bishop Elmar, Do, Stanhope, and Mr Iustice Younge, with the rest of that persecuting & blood thirstie facultie will doe neyther of these. No Felons, no Murtherers, no Traytors in this Land are thus dealt with.
                              There are many of us by the mercies of God still out of their hands. The former holy exercise and profession we purpose not to leave by the assistance of God. Wee haue as good warrant to reject the ordinances of Antichrist, and labour for the recoverie of Christs holy institutions, as our Fathers and brethren in Queene Maries dayes had to doe the like.

The groundes of Christian religion professed and mainteyned in this Land and other Churches round about, we also with one hart and spirit assent unto and professe. Enemies we are to all Poperie, Anabaptistrie, or other heresie, schisme, rebellion, treason or faction; and whatsoever else is contrary to the wholsome doctrine of the Gospell or the prosperity and good estate of this Realme. Our onely desire is so to serve God as that we may please him with reverence & feare: absteyning and keeping our soules and bodies, frō all remnants of the Romane Religion, Idolatrie, superstition and vaine will worship of what sort soever. Wee witnes against the unlawful pompous Hierarchy, & priest hood of this nation, as utterly disagreeing from the Testament of Christ and Ministerie there appointed, in their Offices, callings, administrations and Lordlike livings & maintenance. Against the confuse, prophane and it religious multitude of all sorts of vicious livers baptised into and reteyned in the body of this Church of England

without voluntary profession of, and holy walking in the faith of the Gospell: against their manner of worship & service, by reading prayers out of a book, in stead of true spiritual invocation on the name of the Lord: and briefly, against all other popish aboses & reliques of the man of Syn whatsoever. And because this our testimony maketh against the irregular authoritie of the Prelates, reproveth their evil actions, and disproveth their Pompe, statelynes, rich revenues, stipends, &c. therefore haue they in all hostile manner set themselves against us, persecuting us unto bands, exile and death it self; reproching us as Schismatiques, Donatists, Brownists, seditious persons &c. though they could never cōvince us of these, or any the like crimes: and though we haue not ceased, neyther by Gods grace will cease, to wish and procure good to their soules & bodies in the Lord. Now therefore our humble request is unto your Majestie, Honours; and worships, that notwithstanding these differences we may be suffered to returne into our native countrey here to live in peace practising the faith of Christ which wee profess, and haue long since set forth to the view of the world in our publick Confession wherein none hitherto haue shevved us any errour: and seeing that peoples of other nations are by your Majestie, and Honours, suffered in this Realme, though differing from the ecclesiasticall state of the same; we hope that your Highnes naturall & loyall subjects, may finde like favour at your hands.

To them it will be as the Prophet Ioel saith, A day of darknes and of blacknes, a day of clowdes and obscuritie. Ioel 2.2. Then shall they crye hilles and mountaines cover us from the presence of him▪ that suteth on the throne. (Then shall a good conscience be more worth then a world. And whosoever would haue it at that day must labour to haue and to hold, to nourish & enterteine it, all the daies of his life; lest when he seeks for it he finde it not. And they that once haue it, let thē take heed they make not shipwrack therof.) But for the comfort of all such as are persecuted for conscience sake, and to the terrifyng of their persecutors, the Apostle useth this worthy speech, And in nothing feare your adversaries which is to them a token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. Phil. 1.28.

               You began to speak of the unlawfulnes of appropriating such livings to the maintenance of the true Ministerie & worship, which the idolaters consecrated unto false ministeries & false worship: I desire you cleare that point further if you can. For one would think there can be no use made of them tending more to the honour of God, then the imploying of them to his service and worship.

               The same colour might haue be set upon

the offring up of divers strange beas
                     •
                  es in sacrifice to the Lord, which yet might not be done by any man, at any time, for any cause. And this which you object, carries no fairer a show with it, then did Saul his sparing the fat cattel of Ameleck under the same pretence of offering them in sacrifice to the Lord: but not being according to the minde of God manifested by his word, but contrary to the same▪ it was imputed unto him for rebellion and transgression, which are matched by the Prophet with witchcraft, wickednes, and idolatrie. 1 Sam. 15. For the Lord hath no such pleasure in sacrifice, as when his voice is obeyed. (ibidem.) And thus may you see that Sauls good intent had as faire a colour as can be set upon the imployments of popish livings to true Church uses; yet was this a special cause of his ruyne, and cutting off from his kingdome. God requires not that to be done, which is right in the eyes of man, but all that hee commandeth, and is according to his will revealed, that is to be observed with all strictnes, care, love, readynes and good conscience. Wee must not be wiser, nor holyer then God, neyther doe more in his worship and service then he commandeth. And seing he hath no where cōmanded nor given such livings for his Church and Ministerie, how may any man appoint or appropriate them thereunto? If God had commanded all such livings to have been destroyed utterly, and made voide from all use of man, (as he commanded Adam and Eve not to eat

                  
                     〈◊〉
                   all of the tree of knowledge of good and evill,) should he not therein be obeyed? How much more readily then should men submit unto him therin, seing he alloweth them for charitable uses in the cō
                  mon wealth, & hath appointed another manner of maintenance for the ministerie of his Church, as hath been shewed before.
               And as it is plaine that men haue no commandement from God to bring in such livings for church uses; so neyther may they doe it voluntarilie, without commmandement. For all voluntarie religion and will worship is vaine, and all worship to God, by the inventions, traditions and precepts of men, is also vaine. Esa. 29.13. Mat. 15.8.9. Cull. 2.21.22.23. and against the 2d. Commandement. Exo. 20.4.5.6.
               
               Moreover by the law of God in Deut. 33, it is unlawfull for any man to bring the hyre of a whore, into the house of the Lord our God, for any vowe, (Which vowes vvere voluntarie.) And the reason why such might not be so brought, is there expressed to be, because it is an abomination to the Lord our God. Then whosoever bringeth into his house, for maintenance of his Ministerie, Worship or the like; the livings cōsecrated to the idolatrous worship & ministerie of that Popish heape of Antichristians the false Church, such (I say) doe bring in the hyre of a whore, which by this lawe is unlawful for men, and abomination unto the Lord. For no man can justly deny that spiritual whoredome is as great a sin as carnal, neyther can any truely affirm,

that ever there was a more abominable

For it stands not with the honour of God, that Beth-el, Gods house, should be garnished and supported with the things belonging to or taken from Beth-aven the house of idols. As if the Almightie wanted other meanes for support of his owne house, and must needes be beholden to the house of idols to help him and his. This sin is in nature somwhat differing from the sin of the Babylonians in stealing away the vessels out of the Lords house to busie in the belching banquets of Belshazzar; but it differeth not in substance frō it.

But doutful it is, that after the Bishops heard of the first part & of an intendement of a second, that they hastned the authours death, to stop the current that began to run so strongly against them. Wherfore I exhort you to use this well, read it advisedly, and the Lord direct thy spirit to the right understanding & good use making of all things. And so fare ye well till to morow and the day after.

Queene Elizabeth, and unto this whole State, by discovering these deceivers, and manifesting these heinous abuses and intollerable inormities which remaine in the Land by their meanes to the high displeasure of God, though it be with the present perill and danger of our lives, which those Antichristian Bishops armed with such power and hostilitie will soone upon the knowledge that we haue revealed these matters dispatch one way or another: But we make no reckning nor speach of these things, neyther are our lives deare unto our selves so wee may finish up our testimony and course with joy, and by giving warning (if Gods will be) to prevent the heavie wrath and judgements of God that hangs over this whole land, for the hainous prophanation of Gods name, contempt of his word, and generall impietie even of all degrees: All which enormities here to discuss in particular as they flow from them

into all estates of the land would require a larger discourse then this present time or purpose will permit: Onely in this place it may suffice that we engage our mortall lives & undertake upon the losse of the same to make manifest proof unto all men by the undoubted word of God in any free and christian conference either publike or private: or to make evident demonstratiō in writing by the scriptures (if wee may be permitted) That this whole ministery & publike ministration, which is by them exercised in the Church of England is false & antichristiā, such as cannot be joyned to the gospell of Christ; nor used in the Church of Christ which being proved such, then is it the Princes duetie as she tendereth the salvation of her owne soule, and the safety of all this people which the Lord hath committed unto her charge to abolish and depose the same.
                  Neyther is there cause why her

Majesty should make more scruple or delay herein, then her most royal Auncestor of famous memorie King Henry the eight did in much lesse light and assurance, when he expelled the Pope and suppressed the Abbies &c. Especially when it shall be proved that the whole ministerie which now remayneth even from the Primate Archbishop to the lowest Sommoner, togither with their Courtes, Canons Offices, Officers, &c. are of the same birth, belonged to the same apostaticall throne, have as litle mention, place or use in the testament and Church of Christ as they, and therfore ought in like maner togither with their foresayd father and brethren be cast out, & not to be suffered in the Church or cō
                     mon wealth: Neyther can this matter and motion now seeme strange, seeing all forreign Churches in all other places haue cast out and changed this ministerie, howsoever eyther of ignorance or fleshly policie

they might for a tyme give handes thereunto, yet except they can shew that Christ hath instituted divers & sundry kindes of ministeries and governments unto his Church, one in one age and place, another in an other,
                        Ephes. 4.4.5.6.10.11.12.13. Heb 3.6. & 12.27.28. & 13.8.
                      or that the Ministerie of the new testament is not certaine, permanent and unchangeable, the same in all Churches, then doubtlesse these so divers ministeries, in name, office, entrance, administration, as theirs and this are, cannot both of them be of God. Againe, even at home the forward preachers of these present times (not to speak of such motions unto the Kings of this land at sundry other times) haue a long time sought and sued unto her Majestie and to the Parliaments for a Reformation, viz. That these Arch bishops, Bishops, Arch deacons, Deanes, &c. with all their Courts, colleages, government and administration might be removed and taken away▪ their ample and great livings

converted to the maintenance of sundry poore preachers, and that the Church might be restored to that auncient order and governemēt which Christ hath instituted (by them called discipline): which matter they neither could nor durst have moved or attempted if the office, ministerie, goverment of these Lord Bishops &c. had not beene wholly antichristian,
                        2 Chrō. 29. & 35. ch.
                      and directly contrary to the testament of Christ: For if the office, ministery, and governement of these Lord Bishops and their accomplices had been of God, they ought still of necessitie with all reverence to haue been reserved, the corruptions and abuses that had grown therin to be corrected and purged▪ But if their offices, ministery & governement were the institution and ordinance of Christ, what a dangerous & execrable motion had it been to perswade the Prince and Parliament to reject and cast out the true Offices, Ministery and Government

of Christ out of the Church? They that should thus reject Christs Ministerie,
                        Iob. 13.20. Luke 10.16
                      ordinances, or any part therof, reject Christ himselfe, doe violence to his members, spoile and ruinate the Church, and cannot be of God: But these men sought not the reformation or correction of the persons, or abuses of these Lordly Bishops, their Courts, &c. but the utter remooving and abolishing of their offices, ministery and government for ever out of the land: wherby it is manifest these men (howsoever they haue since changed their copie,) tooke them to be Antichristian and such as ought not to be used or suffered in the Church of Christ.
                  And now that these Bishops and their traine, their offices, ministery, government are thus found, even by the preachers themselves not to be of God, (as to any that will further examine thē by the rules of Christs testament cannot be hid or doubtfull)

we see not how even these Reformists themselves this choice reserved remnāt, or this rable of Parsons, Vicars, Vagrant hireling preachers, without certaine place, office, or charge (which are but the very taile of the dragon) should be exempt from the same judgment,
                        Ioh. 10.1.
                      seing they all are derived and proceeded from the same apostaticall throne that the Bishops, yea even from the throne of the Bishops. So that if the Bishops be not the true ministery of Christ,

But all these most forward Preachers themselves with all the rest of these Parsons, Vicars, Curates, were all ordeyned & made ministers by these Bishops, and execute their Ministerie under them, according to their decrees, receiving their licence, swearing their canonicall obedience, &c.

And loe how the Lord inviteth and inciteth her highnes herevnto preferring her & giving her the preeminence of this glorious work before all the Kings of the world as also how richly he rewardeth all that furder this high service both by putting into their handes the riche spoile of this confused Babylon, & by bringing them to Sion the Citie of his solemne feasts. O what a joy, what a Iubile, what a happie day were this to the whole Land, far surpassing that at Machanajjm to see our heavenly King Christ Iesus thus with one accord received and welcomed into his kingdom, his Church? How should Gods name & our Queenes praise be celebrate for this by every

mouth even with a generall applausion and Celeusme? The sound whereof should not onely fill this Land, but be heard into all others to the giving them example & stirring them up unto the like extirpation of all Idolatrie, and unto the true practise of the Gospel: what Christian, yea what stony heart would hinder God from this glorie, the Prince from this fame, the people from this comfort, themselves and all others from this salvation?
                  How hainous then is the sinne & impietie of the Divines & Prophets of these tymes, against God, their Prince, and the whole land, that by their uttermost power & endevours seeke to stoppe and turne back her Majestie, her most honourable Councellors and Nobles from this holy streight course, by speaking evill of the Gospell & ordinances of Christ, and perverting the streight wayes of God,

their false worship and antichristian ministery to the seducing and destruction of all their soules,

                      or by the light thereof discover and eschew the popish corruptions and abominations which they impose and mainteyne contrary to the truth of the Gospel. These are the onely meanes wherby these Prelates defend themselves or convince their adversaries, which if they were but even a little while plucked out of their hands by her Majestie, and the honourable Governours, and called to the spiritual sword to defēd their doings by the direct rule of Gods word, then were they disarmed, discovered, and confounded at once, then should it soon be seen how wel these timber,

Yet because they bring certaine delusions, calumniations and impediments, in humane wisdome, worldly policie, and divillish deceit, which may deter, trouble, and keep back the weak and simple from this holy reformation and sincere conversion to the gospell of Christ, wee will in the meane time addresse our selves in all brevitie to remove some of their chiefest stumbling blocks out of the way,

                  They object and publish,
                  
                     That to abolish this present Ministerie, worship, traditions, government of their Church, would be an intollerable innovation and most dangerous alteration, to the subvertion of the State, both in regard that these Bishops are

Peares of the same, and their power, Courts and ordinances, have been a long time established and confirmed by sundry Parliaments and so all that speak against them and their proceedings, are enemies unto, and speake against the peaceable estate of this Land.
                  
                  To these politick objections and carnal reasons, we answer with the Apostle,
                        Rom. 8.6.7
                      That the wisdome of the flesh is death, but the wisedome of the spirite life and peace, for that the wisdom of the flesh is an enemie against God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neyther indeed can be.

                      doe not innovate: but they that depart in any jote and swerve from the same, they innovate: The word of God is the Archtype and ground work of all States, degrees, actions,

If then the estate of these Prelates, Clergymen, ministery and their proceedings, can not be approved by, but shalbe foūd repugnant unto the Testament of Christ, then are they pernicious & contrary to the State, drawing into the heavie wrath of God unto utter subversion and destruction: Then are they for the safety of the State, to be abolished, and they whosoever they be enemies to God, to their Prince & unto the whole State that perswade the contrary upon any earthly respect or worldly policy, upon any pretext of expediencie, profite, peace &c. Alas there is no peace

This Kingdom stoode and florished before any Lord Bishops were, and shall much more whē they are gone. What misse hath this State or commune wealth of their elder bretheren the Lord Abbats and the Munks, Friers and those vermine? yet were they rooted to seeming as deepely in this State both in the Church and commune wealth as they, their Cleargie and Ministry now are, & carried as great a semblance of holines, religion, antiquitie, vtility as these doo, & might as well have bene reserved and reformed as any of these. They are all Brethren, of a birth they sprang all

liberal Artes, and so would draw the people and whole Land into ignorance, atheisme, barbaritie, dissolutenes, and in the end change the government from a Monarchie to Democratie or Anarchie.

All power here is yeelded and rendred to the civill Magistrate, every soule being subject, & no part thereof taken away, or takē togither with the civil Magistrate as these Princely Prelates with their Palatine royall

privileges and these Lordly Bishops with their Courtes and civill jurisdiction. Neyther can Satan himself without impudent slaunder accuse the servants of Christ of sedition or disobedience,

And

this wee say that if Gods ordinance, even the Princes lawes and sword, (which yet punisheth some offences) kept not out barbaritie, & dissolutenes, more then their ministery, there should be no peace nor order, neyther might one live by an other in their Church: So that, this their Pseudohierarchie is the most pestilent Anarchie that Satan and all his instruments shall ever be able to raise up,

                  There now remaine certain difficulties & impediments which are propounded by way of question, and being of no great moment are as soon answered as propounded.
                  They demaund; If these spirituall Courts of theirs were taken away, what order then should be taken for Matrimonies, adulteries, testaments, with which

the common lawes of this land meddle not? and also how the civilians should then live? Wee answer, That the triall, judgements, punishments of these causes and offences belong unto the civil Magistrates office,

                      to provide for the reformation of these and many other abuses. And as to the officers of these Courts, they are to be compelled to walk orderly in some lawfull calling:2 Thes. 3.10.12. Ephes. 4.28 Prov. 20.17.
                      There are many godly meanes for them to live by their diligent indeavours in this common wealth: but howsoever they may not be suffered to live or to continue in their ungodly trade: Neither ought the Prince to stay upon their worldly provision frō executing the wil of God which so nearly concerneth her own salvation,
                        Mat. 10.33.
                      and the salvation of all her people.
                  They furder demaund; If these

livings, and revenewes of this present Ministery should be quite taken away, how then the true Ministery should be mainteyned, or these Bishops and Priests hereafter live? To the first we haue alreadie answered; That the true Ministerie should be mainteyned of the free, yet dutifull benevolence of the faithful, especially of that flock unto which they attend and administer, according to the present abilitie of the one and needes of the other. If they here object that if the ministery should haue no more certaine or other maintenance, they should then famish, the people now generally being so worldly, covetous, and uncharitable, as they will hardly pay that which is by law injoyned, much lesse give of their own accord. Wee answer, that this no way hindereth the maintenance of the true Ministery,
                        1 Thes. 5.12.13. 1 Tim. 5.17. Heb. 13.7.
                      but bewrayeth rather the unfaithfulnes and impietie both of the people and present Ministerie: Of the people, in that they no more regard,

love & reverence to their Ministery, if so be it were of God:
                        Mat. 7.6. Ier. 4.4. Amos 6.12. Hos. 4.8.9. Eze. 13.4, 8.9. Mal. 1. Zech. 11.4.5.
                      Of the Ministery in that they so evill instruct this people, standing Ministers and Hierders unto the prophane, worldly, irreligious multitudes, administring or rather sacrilegiously prostituting and selling the most holy things of God, as the sacraments &c. unto them all in this estate for their tithes and wages,
                        2 Cor. 6.14 15.
                      which no true Minister of Christ may doe. The Ministery of Christ belongeth not unto neyther will take charge over such prophane worldlings,
                        Gal. 6.6. & 4.14, 15
                      there can be no spiritual band or communion betwixt them. The true sheep & faithfull people of Christ will not onely bestow their earthly goods, but even their lives for those that bring unto them these heavenly treasures, that tred out the corne and divide the portion unto them,
                        1 Cor. 4.11 Rom. 15.27.
                      that labour for, and watch over their soules &c. Unpossible then it is that the true Ministers of Christ should want meanes

to live whilest they execute their office faithfully (especially where the State receiveth & favoureth the gospel:
                        2 Thes. 3.6 10.14. Rom. 16.17.18.
                     ) Neyther are they any longer to be mainteyned then they execute their office faithfully, or they any longer bound to the flock or any mē
                     ber thereof then they remaine in the faith and obedience of the word of God. Thus still breaketh out the corrupt minde & coloured covetousnes of these tithing & hireling Priests that thus let out their tōgues to hire, make merchandise of the word and port sale of their sacraments, making their bargain sure beforehand, which bindeth them togither howsoever they doe the worke, or the people bring fruites of faith; These things are not regarded or looked to amōgst them either of the Priest or people: Yet these things prove that there can nor may be no such set permanent livings allotted to the Ministerie of the Gospell. And now to the other part of their question, How these Bishops &

Priests should live, if their livings bee taken from them? We answer as above. They may for no worldly cause bee suffered to continue in so unlawfull & ungodly, yea so pernicious a course to themselves and to the whole land, but must be compelled to walk orderly in some lawfull calling or other.
                        Prov. 13.4, & 14.23.
                      God giveth much to the diligent, when the sluggard suffereth want worthily.
                        Mat. 20.
                      Such as haue faith & gifts unto edification never had greater cause to use them,
                        1 Cor. 9.10.
                      to call the people to faith and to instruct them in the wayes of the Lord. The more they thus labour the more they shal deserve to be cherished and esteemed:
                        Psal. 37.25
                      The labourer is worthy of & shal not want his hire both with God & man: The others of them that haue not these gifts may apply themselves in civill things, as to teach the tongues, to instruct children &c.
                  They haue yet an other question; how the people should be taught if al this ministery should be deposed? To which

we answer: The people ought at no hand to be taught by a false Ministery. And further, though they be deposed from their Antichristian ministery, which they exercised to the destruction of their owne soules, and of as many as heard and followed them; yet such of them to whom God hath given fit gifts and graces to teach, ought from henceforth to imploy the same to the glory of God,

            RIght Honourable, we haue as our fraile memories and small measure of knowledge would suffer in the middst of many encombrances in this our miserable imprisonment, drawne an unperfect discourse of such weighty causes, as we were desirous when God should call us thereunto, to make knowne unto her Majestie or some of her Honourable

Councell. And now by your Honours desert and gratious allowance occasioned, we most gladly relate & present the same to your good Lordship onely, as to one whose rare wisdome we know most able to discerne, and whose care to preserve and defend the innocent according to right: Wherefore we most willingly put both this waighty cause & our wofull lives in your hand, to be preserved to some equal triall from our enemies rage like to be increased here upon, in that it so nearely toucheth their estimation and worldly prosperitie. And howsoever these high causes of God (which haue not been hitherto looked into since the first defection from the sincere practise of the gospell in the primitive Church) may seem strange unto your Honour at the first view, especially if they be weighed with humane reason; yet being examined by that Archtype and true patterne of Christs testamēt, we doubt not but your Honour shall see

with us how far the present State is swerved from the inviolable order prescribed; Espetially, if your honour vouchsafe but to look into the office, entrance, and administration of this ministery, you shal soon see it (as some of their own writers confesse & none can deny) to be received by succession from the Pope: who, though he were expelled with many of his enormities out of this Land by her Majesties roiall progenitour, yet remained these offices and lawes, courtes, worship &c. untaken away or suppressed, notwithstanding that the Lord of Hosts had sayd, they shall not take a stone of Babel for a corner,
                  Ier. 31.26.
                nor a stone for foundations, for it shal be desolate for ever: So that it is impossible antichrists ministry should build up or serve in the true Church of Christ, himself having instituted and ordeyned an other Ministerie in his testament, and forbidden and accursed all such as haue not their warrant from thence. It is then our purpose

Right honourable to make plain in our Treatise that when the Pope was expelled, his ministery and orders which came out of the bottomlesse pit, were still reserved and set up in sted of the Ministery and Testamēt of Christ, and so still remaine. Which their Ministery being thus found antichristian must by the Prince be abolished and suppressed, that Gods wrath be not kindled against this whole Land, for the wilfull violating & defacing of Gods ordinances, bowing down unto, endowing and mainteyning of such bitter plants of Antichrists grafting: Neyther will it suffice to say, The Martyrs in Queene Maries dayes stood in these offices in King Edwards dayes; seeing it were great impiety to justify any iniquity by the example of fraile man (no man living without errour.) For that were to set the Martyrs of Christ against Christ, & either to build our faith wholy upon men, and cast aside the Testament; or else to rip up the

haue written and cried out for the utter abolishing of these offices: So that it is of al cōfessed that the Prince ought to suppress & abolish all such offices and orders as cannot be approved by the word of God. Shall then this famous Land Right honorable lie still in the knowne dreggs of Popery under Gods wrath for the same? Shall a few pompous Prelats for their own private lucre, pride and idlenes, with hold the practise of Christs testament, and misleade the whole land to judgement? Shall her Majesties most loyall subjects be persecuted and miserably made away in Prisons, for not bowing downe to these confessed abominations? Shall her Majestic and her most Honourable Councell be thus guiltie of innocent bloud through the Bishops evill dealings? God forbid. Especially the the Lord alluring her Majesty & the Councell both with spiritual promises & heapes of earthly treasures (with much peace and happinesse to the

whole Land) without injurie too, or just complaint of any her subjects, so highly shall they be contented: So that if this be not now received (being thus by Gods providence put into your hands) it will be received in the age to come; whatsoever come of our miserable bodies, it will be looked upon. It is Gods word wh

We haue then further in our discourse right Honourable, taken briefly away some of these silver smithes deceitfull objections, being ready upon the dispence of our lives, through the assistance of Gods spirit, to make all appeare mist, chaffe, and dounge that they can allege for thē

               He was a coepartener with Mr Barrow in his testimony, imprisonment, and death it self. A learned man he was, as appeareth by an answer of his to Mr G. Gyfford touching read prayer. He had formerly been a Minister according to the order of the Church of England, but degraded himself by repentance, as he saith of himself in his Examination. And afterwards he was Teacher in a particular church separated frō the publike assemblies of the land. A Gentleman of a good house tolde me that Queen Elizabeth asked the learned Doct. Raynolds what he thought of those two men? And he answered her Majestie, that it could not availe any thing to shew his judgement concerning them, seeing they were put to death: and being loath to speake his mind further, her Highnes charged him

upon his allegiance to speake. Whereupon he answered, that he vvas perswaded, if they had lived, they would haue been two as worthy instruments for the Church of God, as hath been raised up in this age &c: Her Maiestie sighed and sayd no more. But after that, riding to a Parke by the place where they were executed, called to mind their suffring of death, (and being willing to take further information concerning them,) demanded of the Right Honourable E. of Cumb. (that was present when they suffred) what end they made? He answered, A very godly end, and prayed for your Maiesti

               You have saved me a labour, for I had thought to haue asked some questions hereabouts: but I am satisfied aforehand. Yet I pray you tel me the reasō why they printed not this platform heretofore, and that espetially against the Kings Maiesties first Parliament in England; For that was the time, then was the hope.

               Had his Majestie any Arch or Lord Bishop in all his kingdome of Scotland? were not all pu

                   downe? And who would not then haue thought, but the like worthy work should haue been done in England, after his Highnes coming thither, to haue brought those kingdomes and countries into

Christian uniformitie? This was their hope; who sought no praise to themselves; but desired that his Majestie should (as the instrumentall meanes) haue done it of himselfe, without any mans soliciting; that the whole praise should be primarily unto God the cause of all causes, and secundarily unto his Highnes, for preferring the will of the HIGHEST, in so weightie a point, as the abolishing of Bishops, & converting of their livings unto charitable vses in the common wealth: But seeing things fall out contrary to expectation; It is (in my opinion) great pittie, that such a work should any longer lye unprinted. Wherefore through their neglect, I wil cause it to come forth; being perswaded it shall tend much to the honour of God and relief of many, which is both pietie and pittie. And if it prove any losse to proud Prelates the possessors of those overlarge-livings, it is but their due demerite, and they may all learn therby (God giving them such grace) to make much spirituall profite for their soules health and comfort: wherof they haue farre more need, then of that abundance of bodily benefites. And in hope to effect the ends premised, I intreate all men who shall happen to have any of these coppies, to make good use of them both for their own instruction and benefite, as also for the common good; and that especially against all succeeding Parliaments, till the mark aymed at be rightly hit, and the goale fully wonne.

               But how know you they stayed the printing

of the Plot against the Prelates, upon any such desire, hope, or consideration as you mentioned?
            
            
               Miles.
               I had speech with Mr. Francis Iohnson one of the Pastors of that people, who came with other his assistants to make thei
                     •
                   humble sute to the King, & were readie to enterteyne conference with the Prelates, that his Majestie might the more perfectly haue understood the innocēcy of their cause, and the evilnes of their adversaries: And that same party told me, if they should print the foresaid Platforme, he thought it would give offence, and bee very ill taken, inasmuch as it was thought that the King and Councell would doe something of themselves for the abolishing of Bishops &c. And so they patiently wayted to see what would be done. And wheras God so disposed that Arch Bishop Whitgift at the beginning of the first Parliament after his Majesties coming suddenly died, the sayd Mr Iohnson thus spake unto me and others; That God had shewed unto the King what he would haue him to doe with the rest of the Bishops, in taking away the chiefest of them at such a tyme. And as it was wel observed of him; so I doe most earnestly desire that all whom it concerneth will well call it unto minde, and duely consider of it, for such good use as the GOD of heaven would have to be made by men on earth. For seing that he who is the God above all Gods, Angels, and men, did in his wisdome and providence, put downe at such a tyme, him that was Bishop above al Bishops in the Land: and at once turned him out

of the Councell, Court and Parliament; as also frō the Church, Ministerie, and world it selfe, happily it may insinuate that Bishops are unfit for, and unworthy of, all and every of those places, till they be cast in an other moulde and made all new. And if there be no use of the highest and chiefest of them, and at the chiefest time, as God did seem to shewe unto his Majestie, and to the body of the land then assembled: Then may we think there is as little or lesse use of the inferiour Bishops at any time.

               I grant it worthy to be wel considered and seriously thought upon. But whiles it is in minde I pray you tell me, who penned the second Petition that you shewed me? For you named the authour of the first, but not of the latter.

               I would if I could; but I think rather that they were not: And otherwise the sinne of the Land was the greater that did them no good upon so weighty, so earnest, and so christian a suite; but left them under the tyranny of such bitter Bishops, of whom they are caused so much to complaine. If they were not delivered, there is the more need to

have them published, that such whose hearts God shall any way touch thereby, may make a holy use thereof, to his glory, the good of their own soules, the staying of Gods wrathful judgments from their nation, and for benefite to Gods people for tyme to come: So shall it fare better with the latter wltnesses of Christ, then it did with the former, that stood forth in the forefront of the battel against the Beast: Which warre they waged with the losse of their lives: but happy they in the life to come. For blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, even so saith the Spirite. For they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.

               Yea, and that I caused to appeare before in part. Their Petitions also which I shewed you, do manifest their hard intreaty sundry wayes, and how that many of them through the envie of the Prelates, haue been made to end their dayes in loathsome prisons. And besides that, six of them were executed unto the death, who sealed up their testimony with their bloud; and most chearefully left this world, to goe unto Christ their Redeemer.

whose death is precious in his eyes, Ps. 116.15. King Saul, who slew the Gibeonites, had a better colour for that his fact; then can be set upon the killing of these Christians. For they were of the remnant of the Amorites, whom he might lawfully haue destroyed, yet when peace was made with them wherby the Lord gave them life; Saul greatly sinned in putting them to death. And for this, the Lord brought famine upon the land in the dayes of David. Wherupon that righteous King sayd unto them that remayned, What shall I doe for you, and wherwith shall I make the atonement, that ye may blesse the inheritance of the Lord? To whom they answered; We will have no silver nor golde of Saul nor of his house, neyther for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he sayd, what ye shall say that will I doe for you. Then they answered the King, The man that consumed us, and that imagined evill against us, so that we are destroyed from remayning in any coast of Israel, let seven men of his sonns be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the Lord, in Gibeah of Saul, the Lords chosen. And the King sayd, I will give them, &c. 2 Sam. 21. The dayes may come that God may also stirre up this or some other Prince like David, to call into question the murdering (not of the remnant of the Amorites, but) of the homeborne subjects of our own land, who deserved to live, rather then the prelates themseves that caused them to die. But when justice by man, or judgment from God doe take place, these bloudy men will feele the reward of their iniquitie. For

Haman was not more enviously bent against the Iewes, for the rooting out of them, then our Haman-like Bishops have ben for the destoying of these whom they raile against as Puritans, Brownists, Sectaries, schismatiques, and what not? Thus abusing not onely those who separate from their Antichristian jurisdiction, adulterate ministerie, & false worship, with their government ecclesiasticall; but some such also as stand unseparated from the same, who onely agree in judgement with the former. But as I have put you in mind of the famine which God brought upon Israel in the dayes of David for that bloudy sin done against the Gibeonites in the dayes of Saul; so you may remember and should not forget, that in our land, God brought a great pestilence in the daies of King Iames, so as there died in one citie London, above 3300. in one week: besides those that died in other cities and townes of the same plague. And who knoweth not but that it might be for that bloudy sin against the foresayd Christians, thorow the instigation of the Prelates, who by their murders made these to be martyrs, in the dayes of Q. Eliz. who was of her selfe a most worthy Princesse. God give men wisedome and grace to consider rightly of all thinges, and so of these two thus compared togither.

               But would you wish the like reward to our Bishops, that came upon Sauls bloudy house?
            
            
               Miles.
               No verily. But if I knew it to be the will of God I would. For we are taught to pray that his

will may be done. Mat. 6. And if some of the
                     •
                   might be so served by the command of their Kings and Princes, it would make the rest prove mor
                     •
                   righteous, and lesse hurtfull, then they have beene, or yet are. But I wish with my heart their true repentance that they may escape the judgement of God, & finde mercie with men; learning by this and other examples in the scriptures, to be weaned frō their wickednes. But if ever any King or Queene doe follow the footing of David, for the executing of wrath upon them; or if ever they do fall into the hands of such Lord Tyrants as themselves, then let them acknowledge Gods justice, as did their fore-runner, who sayd, as I haue done, so God hath rewarded me. Iudg. 1.5. But to passe from this, & returne to our former speech about idolatrous livings, wherein (while I think on it) let me knowe your minde, whether you haue not by our conference, or by the Platforme, or both, perceived that the English Bell had but a bad sound which would call men from honouring God, & that noble King Henry, for his heroicall acts against Babell, in the overthrow of her buildings, and inriching the cō
                  mon wealth with the spoiles.

               I am very well satisfied, and I thank you for your paines and love, in applying your selfe to my capacity, making me to know so many needfull things in such ample measure; that though our sinful estate is discovered to be such in England, as giveth just cause of sorrow: yet my heart againe rejoyceth

that I see the way how to shun the danger of it.
            
            
               Miles.
               That is wel for you, and I wish the like good unto the whole nation of the English. But what say you to those exploits of King Henry the 8? For me thinks they made greatly against the beast, false prophet, and his marked souldiers, the marchants of his Babylonist wares, who were by this meanes put in doubt that their trade would decay and come to an overthrow. And if Princes in all dominions would now doe the like against the remainders of those places & offices, the utter downfall of that kingdome of Antichrist would suddenly follow, to the high honour of God, and gladnes of heart to all his people, which should with due regard behold the fulfilling of the prophesies foretelling such a work.

               As one trueth leades unto an other; so by degrees you haue brought me to be of your mind in this point, like as in others. But wherefore are the chiefe defēders of this cause called Brownists?
               
            
            
               Miles.
               Because one Mr Brown minister at Achurch heretofore professed their cause, pubished it in printe, and for a tyme continued the practise of it, till the feare of persecutiō, & love of this world like Demas, or of ease like Isacar, made him to turne his back upon it. And yet (I think if he were asked) his conscience wil not suffer his tongue to say, that it is not the trueth: although he hath left the reliefe of Sion, to live upon the spoiles of Babylon.

               Yes verily. The Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists haue in their authentick writings layd downe the ground 
                     •
                  herof, and upon that ground is all their buiding reared up, and surely setled. Moreover, many of the Martyrs both former and latter haue mainteyned it, as is to be seen in the Acts and Monuments of the Church. Also, in the dayes of Queen Elizabeth, there was a separated Church, wherof Mr Fitz. was Pastor that professed and practised that cause before Mr Browne wrote for it. But he being one of the first writers in her Majesties reigne, therfore those that followed him, (or Christ rather, thorow his means, directing them by Gods word,) were called Brownists, as if they had been baptised into his name: Which were falshood to think, & blasphemie to speake.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               The name makes them very odious to others, and to say the trueth, it caused me to carry some prejudice against them, to the forestalling of my judgement in the things they holde.
            
            
               Miles.
               There are too many that doe so: But let not the name offend you or any; for ther was never any trueth brought to light, but Satan through his notable craft and cunning, hath caused some to paint it out after the names of men, that it might seem base and contemptible in the eyes of all, and to be 
                     •
                  eceived of none. Hereupon haue Christians been called Hussites, Hugonotes, Lutherans, Zuingliaus, Calvinists, Puritans, Brownists, and the like. But

there could be no name more odious then was given to our Maister Christ himself, vvhom the vvicked called Belzebub, and his people must (in their measure) be partaker of his reproch. Let none therfore seeke to haue a good name by doing any evill thing; nor yet for avoiding a bad name, neglect any good that God requires at our hands; neither let any man mesure any truth by the face that foes doe set upon it.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               I perceive by your plea, that if these men had their right, they should be acknovvledged for true Christians, and not to be calumniated by the name of Brovvnists.
            
            
               Miles.
               Your perceiving then is good, & your vvords are just and right; for so they ought to be esteemed.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               But vvhy then doe you so often call them so your selfe?
            
            
               Miles.
               For distinction sake onely, but not at all in reproch: And if you could alvvayes understand me vvhom I meane, vvhen I call them Christians, then vvould I give them no other name.

               Ye sundry tymes. And once in my ovvne sight and hearing at the Sessions in London, foure of them vvere enforced to abjure the land, and in what sort and manner, it may appeare by a vvriting

that seemes then to be taken by some that were beholders thereof, and affected therewith. Which writing was this.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              A Memorandum Anno Domini 1604.
                              IN the Raigne of our now Soveraigne Lord King Iames, who is a defender of the Gospel, foure persons were inforced to abjure the Land for the Gospels sake, (who practised the Ordināces therof, in obedience to the King Christ, whom God set to Raigne in his Church, by the scepter of his word:) separating themselves frō our Church of England, refusing to communicate, joyne, or partake with the same, in the publike Ministerie, worship, and government ecclesiasticall, with many other corruptions derived from Poperie, and are still reteyned in the body & bosome of the English Church. This abjuration was urged upon the Statute of the 35. of Q. Eliz. after they had suffered 3. moneths imprisonment: And (at the publike Sessions in Lō
                                 don,) it was thus carried; That they should take their oathes to depart the Realme within one moneth, and not to returne againe into any of the dominions of the late Queene, without leave from his Majestie, or his Highnes Successors. Their chiefe speaker pleaded, that they were true and faithfull subjects to his Majestie, and had not deserved so to be dealt with; and desired to be discharged without an oath, and they would both promise and be

bound to depart. But that not being granted; he desired that their oath might be with conditions and not so strictly against returning. For sayd hee, we may be occasioned to travel by sea to other coū
                                 tries, & by crosse winds be driven again into those dominions contrary to our purpose. Or, we may be taken at sea, and brought hither by force, and divers the like; and so be forsworne though against our wills. Then it was tolde him that all such things was to be borne with. But he replyed, it could not save their oath from being broken, without such things were expected. Moreover he told the bench that they held themselves so bound to Parents, Prince and Country, that if in an other land, they heard of any treason, it was their duetie to come & disclose the same. And therefore sayd he, I wil never take my oath without conditions: Which he affirmed sundry times. And when he saw notwithstanding, that the oath was strictly administred unto them according to the Statute, he adjoyned this speach himselfe, But if the performance of any dutie to Prince, Countrey, Parents, or the like, doe move me to returne, I will then be free of the oath. And thus he would haue the Bench to understand he swore; but not otherwise. And they all keping silence, the Towne-Clark answered; that in such case they should seeke for leave. And the party replyed, that, the case might require such hast as they could not stay for leave. Then were they commanded to pay their fees, and to be gone within a moneth.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  ANd was not this a lamentable case Desiderius, that in the daies of the gospell, men should be thus entreated for the gospels sake, and for resistance of the ordinances of Antichrist?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               Yes doubtlesse, if it were so.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               Were so! Yes upon the adventure of my best limme, or life it selfe, it was so. And for those things wherein they differ from the opinions and practises in our Church of England, I never savve any trueth more cleare in all my life. As you also may easily perceive, if you scan the difference from point to point by the scriptures. And there is no trueth in England but they hold the same: dissenting onely from them wherein they dissent from the word of GOD ALMIGHTY, which ought to be followed in every jote & tittle thereof.
               Now by the Memorandum that I shewed you, I remember a saying in the Preface of their Confession of faith at their first publishing of it, which sayd, They hoped God would raise up another Iohn Fox to compile togither the latter Martyrs and Witnesses of our Lo: Iesus in these our dayes. And it seemes that the work goes foreward, in that God stirreth up some to keep records of such thinges, for further use in tyme to come.
               Now for the Statute above mentioned, I knowe it was intended against popish Recusants, and not against these. And (without all question) their injuries haue been more then ynough, though Lawes were not wrested against them. And this wrong

was the greater, considering their love and loyalty to Prince & Country: But their judges must come before the Iudge of all the world that wil doe right. In respect wherof I pray for them that their case may be found cleare, through repentance, which is the right way thereunto, if it be done in time. And for all the Saintes here combating under the banner of the great Captaine of the Lords Host, that is, Iesus Christ, it behoveth them in patience to possesse their soules, & looke for their rest when the Lord commeth, who will wipe all teares from their eyes, & give them an inheritance everlasting, immortal, which fadeth not away, reserved in the heavens for them. Which shalbe enjoyed, when others on the left hand, shall both heare a contrary sentence, and receive a worse reward. But as Abigail the wife of Nabal is praised, in that she used such wise and good meanes to prevent and stay David from bringing that evill which he intended against Nabal and all his house, for his churlish, reprochful, and evill answer; so much more shal it be a praise-worthy work, & special part of good seruice & durie, in any that shall perswade & withdraw the Magistrates and people, from bringing any evill upon the servants of God, without a cause. For as the Psalmist sayth, what hath the righteous done? To which every good Christian may answer, They haue surely done that which deserves praise, and not punishment; not imprisonment, reproches, confiscatiō of goods, banishment, untimely death, or any the like evill intreaty.
               
            
            
               
               Desiderius.
               They may so answer, and that truely: but the world vvill not receive it. And now I pray you tell me, What difference doe you put between those people called Brownists, and our sincerest and best professors of the Gospel called Puritans?
               
            
            
               M. Mickelbound.
               The difference is layd downe in few words, The former doe both hold and practise the truth, and separate themselves from the contrarie. The latter haue the trueth in speculation onely, and either dare not or at least doe not practise it. Neither dare or doe they leave off all the unrighteous ordinances of Antichrist, but daily do bend and stoupe unto many of them. And for what cause, others may well conjencture: but their owne hearts can best tell it to themselves.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               But those Christians called Brownists, are at great difference among themselves. For some holdes private communion, others of them will at no hand allow it. And so there ariseth ill will, with decrease of love in one towards another. But I pray you which of those persons or opinions doe you like best?
            
            
               M. Mickelb.
               For their opinion, I would haue my judgement spared at this time: Onely this I say, that their difference is not such as ought to make any division between them: or to breake off the cō
                  munion and fellowship which they had before. And if any doe, it is (doubtlesse) the fault of those that doe it. They haue need therefore to take heed of prejudice and preposterous zeale, which else will be

as a mother & nourse to breed and bring up that wicked weed Envie, a capitall vice, in sted of Christian Love, a holy vertue. Be they then exhorted to shew forth the fruites of Christian moderation, bearing with, and supporting one another; praying with and for one another; enterteyning holy peace between themselves, and with the Lord; setting against the sinnes in themselves, rather then that difference in their brethren; so shall they the better carry forth their good cause against their envious Opposites. For while they combine togither among themselves, they shall be able to push, and at last to overthrowe the Antichristian Kingdome and Hierarchy, against which they joyntly beare witnes. And thus shall they be truely zealous. As for their persons, there is neither of them doe lose one jote of my love, if they continue their love to the Lord, and his commandements, walking faithfully according to that which he giveth them to see and knowe by his word, both in holynes to himselfe, righteousnes towards men, and sobriety in themselves, with abstinence from worldly lusts. And if they alike thus walk, my love is alike unto them.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               Some doe object against them their manner of receiving the Lords supper, as being rude, unreverent, malepert, and too too presumptuous; sitting upon their seates, as if they were Christs Camerades: whereas for more reverence they ought to take it kneeling.
            
            
               
               Miles.
               This is no more against the former called Brownists, then it is against the latter called Puritans, even the best and sincerest of them: For they likewise so hold, that it ought not to be takē kneeling▪ but sitting: and eyther doe or faine would so practise, if they could in safetie, or durst indure the trouble following after it. But for the point it selfe, How doe those objecters prove, that such manner of receiving, is presumptuous &c? But are not they presumptuous rather that shal make them selves wiser then Christ, and give lawes in his kingdome or Church, which himself (the onely Law giver) hath not given? Do they think that their good intents will carry out any thing in Gods worship, which hath not warrant in his word? If that were so, then had not Vzzah been slaine, for staying the Ark of God from shaking; 2 Sam. 6.6.7. Neyther should King Saul haue been rejected for saving alive the fat cattel of Amalek, to offer in sacrifice to God. 1. Sam. 15. But the point being sufficiently cleared by sundry writers, I referre you to them. And I, what should I need to say more but this, that 
                     •
                  ee must in all thinges looke unto the first institution, as our Lord Iesus himself also did, when men spake unto him of putting away their wives, who told thē that Moses for the hardnes of their heartes suffered it; but from the beginning it was not so. And in like manner, to such as plead for kneeling at the receiving of the Lords supper, we may answer, that for want of love to the Lord and his trueth, it hath

pleased him to give them over to hardnes of heart & strong delusions. And as the Papists those grosse idolaters, receiving the signes of Christs body and bloud, to wit, bread and wine, thinking it to be the very body and bloud it selfe, contrary to their own senses; they doe for more reverence to it, kneel before it, and worship it as their God and Maker: even so our formal Protestants at the celebration of the Lords supper do likewise kneele; imitating therin those idolaters, and so nourishing that popish errour of errours. But from the beginning it was not so. For at the first institutiō, it was received as they sate at the Table; But we can no where finde in all the scriptures, that ever they received it kneeling; or that ever true Christians beleeved those holy signes were transubstantiated into the body and bloud of Christ as the Papists falsely teach▪ Therefore as well that opinion, as their and the Protestants practise, is highly sinfull, and for ever ought to be shunned. Both because God never required such a beleefe, nor appointed such a gesture in the act of communion, as they haue taken up to themselves, from the brain of mans mere invention. Wee are therfore to take heed what examples we follow. Dinah the daughter of Iakob, going forth to see the daughters of the countrey where they came, was defiled bodily: but some of our Protestants looking forth to see after what fashion the Papists served God before them, haue been defiled spiritually. Wheras they should haue remembred and observed, that which is written

for our learning, (in Levit. 18.3.4.) and commanded Israel of old, saying; After the doings of the Land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not doe: And after the manner of the land of Canaan whither I will bring you, shall ye not doe, neyther walk in their ordinances, But doe after my iudgementes, and keep mine ordinances to walk therein: &c.
               
            
            
               Desiderius.
               It is a good instruction: And being well followed, it will prevent infinite errours and other abominations. But how doe you manifest that the Papists doe worship the signes of Christs body and bloud, as the very body and bloud it self, and that contrarie to their own senses, as you sayd. For if that be true, they are most vile idolaters indeed.
            
            
               Miles.
               So they are. For when they receive the bread, they see it, feele it, smell it and tast it to be bread, yet they beleeve in the heart & say with the mouth, that it is body, even the same that was crucified on the crosse; quite contrary to their owne senses of seeing, feeling, smelling and tasting, as I sayd before. And that bread, which their own sense tells them, is no other creature but bread, doe they adore and worship as the Creator, as God, & as Christ. And so in like maner beleive they the wine to be the very bloud of God Christ, which was shed for the redemption of the Church. Which horrible idolatrie of theirs is as grosse, as to worship & beleeve in a molten or carved image, in sted of the true God. And both these sorts of idolatrie, are not

onely against the second commandement, but also against the first. Thus may you perceive that the Papists are deluded with a lye extraordinary; beleving the lying miracle of transubstantiation. Wheras in all true miracles wrought by Christ and his Apostles, never any were taught to beleeve any thing contrary to their owne sight, and their other senses; but these seduced soules are miserably misled that way. And why? even because their lying prophets doe so beleeve and teach. But is it not as strange that they will haue so many Christs at one and the same time? For after the words of consecration are used, those signes are transubstantiated into the very body and bloud of Christ (by their opinion) & becommeth the whole Christ: so that if they doe the like in an hundred thousand places at once, they haue then (if you will beleeve them) so many CHRISTS. And they being all eaten up in one day, yet they can make as many moe in another: and that as often as they consecrate their bread to such an end or use. And is not this a wonderfull miracle, and these marvelous men, thas can by the words of their mouthes effect such strange things? Or rather are not these monsters among men, to beleeve such strange and strong delusions? But so shall it fare with those that haue not the love of the trueth. 2. Thes 
                  
                     •
                  . And now let us leave them to their wandrings, seing they are so bewitched, that nothing which man can doe, is able to drawe them from their delusions into the right way and trueth of the gospel 
                     •

               The more is the pitie. For as we ar debters unto all; so I would we could doe them good.
            
            
               M. Mickelbound.
               They haue the letter of the scripture in that point before spoken of. For Christ saith in Ioh. 6. This is my body: But they haue not the meaning at all. Neyther doe they consider that all sacramentall signes haue the name of the thing signified. As for example: The tree of life, and the eating therof, was a sacramentall signe to them that should live in obedience to God, that they should haue life. The tree of knowledge of good and evil, had the name of that which they should (by lamentable experience) finde, if they (contrarie to Gods cōmandement) should eat thereof. The Altar, which Iakob builded unto God, he called by the name of the Mighty God of Israel. Not that it was so indeed: But that it was a signe & remembrance, of that God who had appeared unto him, for his helpe; and had mightilie delivered him from the furious hands of his brother Esau. And other the like examples are in the scriptures. Even so Christ sayth of the elemental signes of bread and wine, in the Lords supper: Take eate, &c. This is my body▪ this is my bloud, &c. Not that they are so in deed, for when he spake those words his blessed body was at the table among his disciples, and not in the bread; as they plainely sawe with their eyes, and did know with understanding: But they were true signes of his body and bloud, and as verily as they received them; so certainly should every true beleever receive

Christ and all his merites, to be fully theirs by faith. And the papists that worship these signes as the very body and blould of Christ, (because they were in mysterie so called;) If they had lived in the dayes of Iakob, they might as wel, and it is like they would, haue worshiped that Altar, as the Mighty God, because it was in mysterie (that is, in signe and signification) so called. But as therein they should haue been notable idolaters, so are they in worshiping a peece of bread which they eat, as God the Creator both of it & them. And seing they think that to be their God, if now they would see their foolishnes by a fewe wordes. I wish them to consider what becomes of it in short space after they haue eaten it, & so they shal see that if ever it was a God, it soon vanisheth away and becommeth none, which is contrary to the nature of the true God, who is eternal, immortal, unchangeable, &c. but the bread eaten, goeth into the belly, and is caried out into the draught, as Christ speaketh. So that this their God Bread, is more base then the God Bell, or any of the the Gods of the heathens. And are not these grosse idolaters? Yea, this their absurd foolishnes, was a stumbling block unto Averois, of whō I haue read, that he sayd; Because the Christians eat that God which they worship, my soule shall be with the Philosophers.
               
               Wherfore, I would they might learne, that as the outward signes of bread and wine, being received into the belly, turneth unto the nourishment of the body, so Christ being received into the soule by

faith, is the true nourishment therof, and salvation of the whole man. For he hath redeemed us from death & destructiō, iustified us in the sight of God, and procured us life with him. All which we apprehend thorow faith. But in this trueth I know you are already grounded, so as I need not speak further for your instruction; and as for them, should I speak, should I write, should I doe all I can, it will not profite them. For (without the extraordinary work of God,) they must still beleeve as their church beleeves. For that cannot erre, as they fondly suppose. So that it may hold what it vvill and they must hold the same, vvithout all triall or mistrust. Thus by one error, they are fast fettered in many; & must be left to their blind guides, till they fall togither into the ditch. For other guides they will not haue. Therfore I shall now spare a labour, and speake no further of this point.

               Thus brought I you out of the way wherin you were shewing the unlawfulnes of kneeling in the sacramēt. Yet vvas it not vvithout fruit, for even by that vvhich you haue sayd, men may playnely see, that vvee ought not to conceite or imitate those supersticious, idolatrous, and absurd Papists, vvho are so addicted to their ovvne vvayes, and are like those that cried, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. Act. 19.28. And great vvith these, is their goddesse the false church.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               But vvhat say you of the Christians whose cause I pleaded for, that addict themselves to

the wayes and word of God.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               I freely acknowledge that such ought to be lovingly respected. And you haue brought me to like better of them then ever I did; but espetially that you so well cleared their doctrine of faith to be sound, and their separation to be but from sin, and such outward orders and ordinances, that are unsound and sinfull: which they therefore forsake, that they might doe the will of God according to his written word; the light of our feet and lanterne to all our pathes.
            
            
               M. Mick
               You haue sayd ynough to cleare them both from heresie and schisme; for he is no heretique that is sound in the faith. And he is no schismatique that separates onely from disorder & sin. For we ought not to communicate in sin either with men or Angels.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               And that is the ground whereupon I my selfe neyther doe nor dare communicate in the Church of England with that sinful ordinance of man the service book, or book of cōmon prayer.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               If you professe so much in England by your practise, as you haue here confessed with your mouth, you may happen to be called a Brownist, if not to tast of other hard intreaty.
            
            
               Des.
               Yet the truth is the truth. Which as it appeareth unto me, so stand I bound to obey unto it. But I pray you why doe the foresayd people solemnize mariage in civil Assemblies or dwellings?
            
            
               M. Mick.
               Because it is a civil action, and ought

civilly to be performed, according to the true nature of it.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               Why, it is the judgment almost of all men to haue it done in the Church by a Minister. And (in England) it is a common received custome to haue it so performed.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               I wish rather that for the proofe of it you could haue sayd, Thus saith the Lord. And then to haue shewed the chapter and verse where it is so sayd. But you haue done nothing lesse, neither in deed it is impossible to be done: there being no such thing once named or implied in all the scripture. And consequently, the ground whereon you stand is not rocky and firme, but unsure and sandy, which shall wash away with the raine, & every house built upon such a foundation, when the flouds come and the windes blowe, shall certainly fall, as we may learne both by Christs own doctrine in the Gospell, and reason it selfe doth shewe the same. And if an Argument drawen from a common custome be good, then if it be a common custome to haue the Lords holy Sabbaths profaned with Beare and Bull baiting, with dicing and carding, with May games and morrice dance, with laciviousnes and luxurie, with rifling or revelling, &c. then all is good, and all may be done, sane conscientia: But I hope that both you and every childe of God truely sanctified, doe defie and abhorre all such things, not onely on the Sabbath dayes, but every day of the week, and of their whole life.
               
                  And is it not a common received custome in England, to worship God by their book of cōmon prayer in English, as the Papists by their Massebook in Latin, and by their Images, beades, crucifixes, and other the like; in stead of true invocation upon the Name of God by the work of his Spirite: But being all vvithout and against the vvarrant of the vvord of God, your self dare neyther practise nor approve them. And vvhy then doe you not minde the like in other things no less unvvarrantable. As is the solemnization of mariage ecclesiastically, and other such like. Many abominations might be pleaded for by common custome, and multitude of men in that minde. But lay aside these sandy grounds, and heare the vvords of the Lavve, Thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe evill, neyther agree in a controversie to decline after many and overthrow the truth. Exod. 23.2.
               
               Beleeve it for truth, That
               All Church actions, are layd dovvne in the scriptures, vvhich is the rule of truth: But in them vve finde no mention of mariage to be a Church action: Therefore it ought not to be so made or used.
               And againe, All the dueties of the Ministerie are expressed in the scriptures: But in them there is no more mention or vvarrant for the ministers solemnizing of mariages, to the living, then is for their burying of the dead, vvhich is just none at all. Ergo, they are both unlavvfull, and ought not to be done.
               
                  And where you affirme the contrary, saying, it ought to be done by a Minister; doe you meane a minister indefinitely, without any respect, whether he be true or false?
            
            
               Desiderius.
               No, But I meane a true Minister onely. For no true Christian ought to goe to false minister for any such end.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               Your reason is right and good: But then the Ministers of England haue no right in that work, they being in respect of their offices, not true but false Ministers, and so proved.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               But in respect of their guiftes they may be sayd to be the Ministers of Christ. For many of them haue excellent giftes.
            
            
               M. M.
               So had Balaam likewise, who yet was but a false Minister and a Southsayer. And so haue many Lawyers & others in our Land, if they would and might be suffred to exercise their gifts, who yet are no Ministers at all. Gifts then doe help to make men fit for a Ministerie, but doe not make them ministers, much lesse true Ministers. For every true Minister must not onely be qualified with gifts fitting for the same: But must also be lawfully called thereunto. Even as, every civil Magistrate & Iudge, must not onely be qualified with guifts fitt for the Magistracie and Iudgeship which he exerciseth, but must also be lawfully called thereunto, and rightly put into the possession thereof. But where you say, many of the Ministers of England haue great gifts, and therupon conclude them to be true Ministers,

you therein condemne the dumbe ministerie that doe but read their stervice onely, and haue no gifts for praying nor preaching.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               It is no matter. Let them goe undefended. For I hold them false Ministers, and meddle not with them.
            
            
               M. Mick.
               Yet they haue the same Ministerie with those that haue the greatest guiftes. So that if the one be false, the other is so likewise. Again, if men haue neuer so good gifts, and be called unto a false ministerie, they are (notwithstanding their giftes) false ministers. But now to returne to our former point, and apply this to the purpose. Mariage is the ordinance of God; but a false ministery is the ordinance of the Divil. And (sayth the Apostle) I would not that ye should haue fellowship with the Divils. 1. Cor. 10.20. These can haue no more communion togither then Light with Darknes, Christ with Beleal, or the Beleever with the Infidel. All which is condemned, 2 Cor. 6.
               
               Moreover, If you would haue no mariages right and lawfull, unlesse they be solemnized by a true Minister; then you must eyther make the popish min
                     •
                  sterie in Q. Maries dayes to be true Ministers, or else all that were then so maried, to be unlawfull mariages, and the children that were begotten of such parents to be illigitimate, that is to say bastards. But were it not a fowle extremitie to affirme eyther of these? Doubtlesse a Mariner that should he so absurd in sayling, would soon run his ship upon

the sands, or break it asunder against the rocks.
               Againe, If mariages be onely lawful that are made up in a Church by a Minister; then wheresoever there is not a Church and Ministerie, there can be no lawful mariage. But the Apostle teacheth otherwise and saith, that mariage is honourable among all, Heb. 13. And therfore not onely where there is a Church and Ministerie, but also where there is none. So that mariage is Gods ordinance, & lawful to be performed even among the Pagans.
               Furthermore, If mariage be onely right & lawful, when and where it is done in a Church by the Minister▪ then are all mariages to be condemned that haue been made up in Christian Countreyes civilly before the Magistrates. But that they may not be. For the word of God gives approbation to such mariages, in the mariage of Boaz & Ruth, wherof we read, Ruth 4.9.10.11.12. And on the contrary, shew you if you can, any one place in all the holy scripture, that approveth of mariage to be eyther a sacrament, as the blinde Papists would haue it; or a Church action, for the minister to performe; as you and our Protestants doe plead. By which plea & practise you notably nourish the old popish errour, that Mariage is a Sacrament.
            
            
               Desiderius.
               I will reason no further in this matter. For I perceive that both scripture and reason is against me. And when I finde it so, down goes the bucklers. For I love not to be a proctor in a bad cause.
            
            
               
               M. Mickelh.
               It goes wel where there is so good a conscence. (But it is not so in the Spirituall Courts, which are as worthy to goe downe as your bucklers.) And had you held out longer, you had heard more. But here is this briefe writing concerning the point, which in likelihood was written by some of that people of the right Christian prosession; though I neither know how, where, nor when I came by it. But a special end of it might be in the providence of God for your good.
               
                  Let him that readeth consider.
               
               THat which the word of God doth approve & incō
                  mend unto us to be good and lawfull, that ought all to reverence and obey: Yea though the lawes decrees & customes of men were to the contrary: Much more where any thing is done which both the law of God, & law of man doth allow to be lawfull, none can disallow or speak evill of it, except they be such as eyther in bad conscience or great ignorance doe open their mouthes both against heaven and earth. Which fearefull sin, the Lord keepe all his servants from.
               Now to apply this to a question objected concerning mariage, I holde and affirme as followeth.
               
                  Viz. That where a man and a woman (that may mary together by the word of God) doe take one an other for husband and wife, by words of the present tyme, before lawfull witnesses, using prayer to God to blesse them therein, that (I say) is lawful mariage, and allowed both by the word of God and law of man.
               1. The Word of God. By the word of God, as may be seene in these scriptures, Gen. 2.22.23.24. Ruth 2.9.10.11.12. Math. Prov. 2.17. Rom. 7.3. Gen. 29.21.22.23. compared with 1 Tim. 4.5.
               
                  Then also by the law of man, and that both by the cō
                  mon law of this land, and by the civil law also, and even the canon law it selfe.
               (2. The law of this land.) For the common law of this land, see the Statute of 32. Henr. 8. chap. 38. revived in the 1. of Q. Eliz. directly and of purpose alloweth and ratifieth all mariages done according to the word of God. The words of the Statute are these,
               Wheras heretofore the Bishop of Rome hath alwayes intangled and troubled the mindes of people against the regal power of this Realm of England, and also much unquieted the subjects of the same, by his usurped power in them, as by making that unlawfull, which by Gods word is lawfull, both in mariages and other things, &c. And wheras also other prohibitiōs then Gods law admitteth, much more debate and suite of law, with wrongfull vexation of the innocent party hath bene procured, and many just mariages brought in doubt, and danger of undooing, and also many times undone, and lawfull heires disinherited, wherof there had never else (but for that usurpation) been moved any question, since freedome in thē was given us by the law, which ought to be most sure & certaine, &c. Be it therefore enacted that no re
                     •
                  ervation or prohibition Gods law excepted, shall trouble or impeach any mariages without the Leviticall degrees, & that no person of what estate degree or condition soever hee or shee be, shalbe admitted within any of the spirituall Courts, within this Realme, to any proces plea or allegation contrary to this foresayd Act.
               Againe in Anno 25. Henr. 8. ch. 22. the Satute hath these words as followeth,
               The Parliaments, Convocations, and Vniversities agreed, that even in matters of mariage, no man of what estate degree or condition soever, hath any power to dispence with Gods lawes.
               
                  (3. Book of cōmon prayer.) Whereto also the Book of Common prayer agreeth, which in expresse termes avoweth their matrimony to be lawful who are coupled togither so as Gods word doth allowe, and declareth moreover, that the very thing which maketh mariage, is the covenant betwixt the parties themselves, when they take one another for man and wife, by words of the present time: as may be seen in the Booke of Common prayer, in the charge given to the parties, & the parties speeches one to an other.
               (4. Civil law.) Next as touching the Civil Lavv, it defineth that to be lavvful mariage, vvhen the parties that may mary togither and are of yeares doe both of them consent in taking each other for man and vvife, if they be at their ovvne government, or if they haue parents, vvith their consent. For this see Vspian. tit. 5.1. Iustinian institut. lib. 1. tit. 9.1. et tit. 10. Gaij institut. lib. 1. tit. 4.
               (5. Canon law.) Lastly touching the Canon lavve, it also defineth and declareth, that the onely thing vvhich maketh the mariage is the mutuall vvilling consent of the parties, declared by vvordes or signes of the present tyme. See for this Can. Sufficiat 27.
                     •
                  .2. et Titus de spous.
               
               But thus as aforesaid vvere he and his vvife maried togither: that is, being such as might marie by the vvord of God, they took one an other for husband & vvife, by vvords of the present time before lavvfull vvitnesses, having prayer also made unto God to blesse them therein.

Yet I am assured that the time shall come wherein God will honour some with the work of that good King Iosias, in a larger measure for reformation then ever yet was seen in England. And as any of these copies shall come into the hands of gratious persons, be they humbly intreated conscionably to consider of the matter, and accordingly labour to advance the glory of God, and to procure the good both of the King and Countrey, by effecting (through diligent suite, & holy endeavors) reformation in the things before treated on.
