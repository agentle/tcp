            The Epistle Dedicatorie. To the giddie multitude.
            CVstome (that imperious King, or rather cruell Tyrant) hath so farre preuayled in these our dayes, that euery Pamphlet must haue his Patron, or els all the fatte is in the fire: Now I not knowing anye one whose name I might be so 
                  •
               olde with, as to make a shelter for this substance-wāting shadow, dedicate it to you al, so shal I be sure to offend none. And as he that speaketh in the defence of womē, hauing a flock of femals for his Auditors (how-soeuer his cause be) is sure to want no wordes on his side: So let him that shall speake against this Toy, looke for more fists then his owne about his eares, & take heed of Club lawe, since the brainlesse multitude hath vouchsafed to take it into their protection. Now therefore, thou many headed beast, censure me at thy pleasure: like or dislike what thou

listest; but haue an especial care of this, that thou beest not ouer constant in thine opinions: But what euen now thou praysest to the heauens, by and by dispraise againe, as the vildest stuffe thou euer heardest of. Extoll that with admiration, which but a little before thou didst rayle at, as most carterly: And when thou sittest to consult about any weighty matter, let either iustice Shallowe, or his Cousen Mr. VVeathercocke be foreman of the Iurie. Thus relying on thy Moon-like constancie, I will shrowde this shadowe vnder thy alwaies-vnstedfast fauour.

                      neither will I terme thee learned nor vnlearned, for I was not acquainted with thy education: Nor yet will I praise this Pamphlet (as contayning pleasure or profit) for if thou beest wise, thou canst perceiue it better then I; if otherwise, it will be in vaine, for I shall neuer be able to make thee conceiue it. If thou like it, thou hast wherefore to thanke me, for procuring thy delight; if thou dislike it, lay it out of thy hands, for it were great follie wilfully to procure thine owne discontent. If thou doost reap any profit by it, the more is thy discretion
                        •
                      if none at all, the worsse is thy fortune. Thus not looking to be enriched through thy fauour, I shall still remaine:
                  
                     Thy poore friend,

               To heare of these disorders makes me weep
               (Quoth he) let's heare what mirth comes frō your sleep
               
                  List then: Me thought a christall streame did glide
               Alongst a valley, by a Forrest side:
               Through which an heard of Elephants did swimme,
               From forth the desart, to the hither brimme:
               Me thought it did me good (euen as I slept)
               To see the goodly order that they kept.
               The elder had a care, till all were o're
               To keep the weake and yongest still before;
               For so with lesser perill might they passe,
               whilst yet the quiet streame vntroubled was.
               And if that any danger hapt beside,
               For their defence they better might prouide.
               No sooner had the last set foot on land,
               But all the rest about him make a stand:
               When thus the big bone'd beast the rest bespake:
               Perceiue you not how all the Forrests shake
               When I doe passe along? how eu'ry tree
               Doe bend their tops (in dutie) vnto me?
               What beast in desart can with me compare:

               My Lords (who set to arbitrate our cause)
               I hope you shall not need long time to pause,
               To passe your censure, when both partes you heare,
               For I shall make it very plaine appeare,
               This little Skip-iack beast, his worth is small.
               Why grace I him so much? no beast at all.
               For eu'ry beast produceth his owne kinde:
               But Fleas to breed of sweat and dust we finde.
               As his beginning is obscure, and bace,
               So of his life is the whole course and race.
               Yet graunt he were a beast, graunt him so much:
               What judgement is so blinde to thinke him such,
               As that he may be likened vnto me?
               Whose breath oreturnes ten thousand such as he

                  Looke on our statures, see what oddes there is,
               Such difference is there 'twixt my worth and his.
               His person's little, little is his worth:
               What acte praise-worthy can such dwarffs bring forth
               You see my limbes are large, my ioynts are strong,
               Able to further right, or right my wrong:
               Let me speake boldely, ther's no beast in field
               But that (for strength) to me will easely yeild.
               Beholde (my Lords) this Castle-bearing backe,
               And thinke what strength is in this dwarfish iack.
               Yet durst the elfe prouoke me to the fight;
               Well might the world henceforth contemne my might
               If with this atomye I should contend.
               But too much time in that's well knowne I spend.
               Leauing the bodye, let's come to the minde:
               How many vertues therein shall you finde?
               My fortitude in this most plaine appeares,
               That man (who rule ouer all creatures beares)

               And then doth charge me with ingratitude,
               O see how well his speeches doe agree:
               Obserue them well, you'l finde them contrary.
               Either their entertaine must willing be,
               Or from ingratitude acquit me free.
               Am I in debt to him who did me good?

               Ile thanke my fortune, and not his intent.
               But was he willing? then I may conclude,
               He wrongs me much, who saith I did intrude.
               Fauour and force, neuer so well agree,
               That both at once can in one subject bee.
               But when he sawe his speech truth's colour lacke,
               He wrangles at my colour, cause tis blacke.

               Well, be it so: although I laugh not now,
               I could (if I see cause) as well as thou.
               But heere were rather greater cause to weepe,
               If cause of either can proceed from sleepe.

                  oggie fumes are spent,
               Which to the braine, were from the stomacke sent.
               Our restlesse phantasies repeat things ore,
               Which we imagined the day defore.
               For nothing comes in our intellgence,
               Which was not let in by the doore of sence.
               The seu'rall thinges which we awake recite,
               In dreames our 
                     •
                  ancies oftentimes vnite.
               As when of golde and mountaines hath bene tolde,
               Our dreames present vs mountaines all of golde.
               We talke of horses, and of flying things,
               And then we dreame of horses that haue wings.
               
                  Tis like of beasts, and strife, hath beene thy theame,
               And that from thence proceedes this idle dreame.
               Idle doost call it? quoth Democritus)
               Yet rather had I thou shouldst terme it thus,
               Then to interpret, or to wrest it, so
               As curious and busie heads would doe.
               What by the Flea? what by the Dog was ment?
               What by the Elephant, was his intent?
               They'l ayme at this, and that perticuler,
               And each thing as it pleaseth them transfer.
               Such fooles as these would descant on my dreame,
               And it interpret, as it best shall seeme
               To their weake wit, and blunt capacitye,
               Censure each worde, each sentence misapplye.
               If I should light on such a giddie asse,
               I'd scorne to answer him, but let him passe.
               But vnto thee an answer must be sought,
               You say dreames doe repeat but things forethought,
               In such 't is true, as sleepe free scope affoord,
               But such as I vse sleepe, not as a Lord,
               Not suffring it to rule, but serue our need,
               And thus from this same sorte of dreames are freed.
