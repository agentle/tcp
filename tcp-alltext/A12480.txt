               MAny good Captains (Right Reverende and my very good Lord) thinke it, not their duety, to fight thēselues, but only to giue cōmand to others: and Physicians without blame prescribe to others that which they apply not to themselues: but of the preacher of the worde of God it is justly required, no lesse in life & practise, thē in speech or writing, to expresse the soundnes of doctrine, or, to speake it in Homers words,

as by his doctrine hee must preach to our cares, so by his example hee must preach to our eies: that so by both he might lay hole of our hartes, as by the light of the one hee must direct vs that we stray not, so by the footsteps of the other he must lead vs that

we stumble not, & by the harmony of both affect vs that we slacke not. Thus if he doe, not only teaching, as Christ taught, but also

               ā common wealth. By hid doctrine hee shall win assent and obedience: by his example, imitation and loue: and by both admiration and reverence. That the author of this learned and godly sermon is one of these, there is no need to prooue: nor how his life and practise, as if it had beene the other twin of the same mother, or the other hand of the same body, hath alway been answerable to the doctrine of humility, which in this sermon is handled at large, although I envy not that there are very many arguments to make this point plaine: yet I could wish there were not so many by one: and that, seeing his humble and modest minde may & doth otherwise so easily appear, he would spare to shew it, by his vnwillingnes to publish his learned labours: by which at this time others are forced to publish some parte of them for him without making him acquainted therwith. As for the rest seeing it must be so, we are content

               1. The words of the text▪ though spoken vpon speciall occasion to the Iewes, haue their vse at all times, and among all nations.
               2 Boasting is a very common fault.
               3. The basenes of man, and liberality of God is a chiefe reason against all pride and boasting.
               4. Pride hinders our knowledge & practise in Christian religion
               5. Pride is a confluence of many sinnes.
               6. As pride, so boasting as her daughter, is to bee avoided.
               7 Mans wisdome is not his own nor of himselfe, and therefore not to be gloried in.
               8. In matters of learning it is very vnperfect (God only being truely wise) and therefore also not to be boasted of.
               9. In matters of state it is very vncertaine.
               10. Policie falsly so called, is not to be gloried in, but to be hated: as the cause of the corrupt execution of the busines of the common wealth & of neutrality in religion.

               12. Riches draw on enemies to spoile vs.

               THE Prophet ZACHARIH in his first Chap: hath thus. Your fathers.
               Zach. 1. 5. 6. 
               VVhere are they? and doe the Prophets liue for ever? But did not my words, and my statutes, which I commanded by my servāts the Prophets, take hold of your fathers? Meaning that they did take hold of their fathers, & would take hold of them also: except they repented.

So 1. Cor. 10. the Apostle saith,1. Cor. 10. 11 
               These thinges came to them for ensamples, but are written to admonish vs, vpon whom the ends of the world are come: Signifying that the iudgments of God recorded in the worde, and the vvhole word it selfe, was not ordained for the instructiō only of them, in whose daies it was written, but to bee for the vse of the Church in al succeeding ages.

The whole devise being laide togither importing thus much, and preaching thus much:

               of the world (O all togither.) to you all be it knowne, that God doth hate impudencie. This hath Clemens Alexandrinus in the 5. of his stromats. The like may bee saide of the present text, which I haue in hand, that, albeit it be a part of a sermon, that the Prophet Ieremie made vnto the children of Israel a little before their captivity into Babylon (wherein he assureth them, that pietie only, & no carnal sleights, or abilities, should be able to do them good in that feareful day) and so might seeme to be proper to that nation, & to that occasion: yet for al that, if we wil not mistake it, wee are to take it for an everlasting sermon (there is mention in the Revelation of an everlasting gospell) & evenRev. 14. 6. for a general proclamation against all haughtines & vaine confidence of mē, whether they bee Iewes or Gentiles, young or old: evē against all those, that doe not set God before their eies: making him their stay▪ but do boast themselues of the sharpnes of their wit, or of

the strength of their arme, or of the greatnesse of their wealth, which the Lord doth not accompt of. And that this generall vse is to bee made of this parcell of Scripture▪ the holie Ghost himselfe, the best interpretour of his own meaning. doth plainly declare. 1.1. Cor. 1. 31. 
               Cor. 1. 31. & 2 Cor. 10. 17. to the which2. Cor. 10. 17 places for brevity sake I do referre you. And here that observation of Tertullian

            And what doth he speake vnto vs in the words of my text? In summe, and in grosse thus much: to purge out the old leaven of arrogancie; and insolenci

               , that we may be a sweete lumpe of modestie and thankfulnes vnto the Lord. In particular these two pointes. First that wee would weane ourselues from all carnall boasting, whether of our wit and cunning, or of our power and authority, or of our wealth and other abilities: this in the former verse. Secondly that we would entertaine, & embrace a spirituall kinde of reioicing for Gods great mercies, and favor toward vs, &

            Touching the former: many are deceiued (beloved) concerning this matter of boasting. for neither is it proper to a few fooles only, as some haue imagined, (for these fooles are found every where) nether is it a fault of vanity only or indiscretion, but even of iniquity, and sinnefulnes.

               Proverbs Salomon saith, Many men will boast, every one of his owne goodnes; but who can finde a faithful man? where he sheweth the fault to be generall, or as good as generall. So Seneca epist. 47. speaketh indefinitely, Regum nobis induimus animos: every one of vs heareth the minde of an Emperour: then we wil not be farre behinde for boasting: this for sentences. As for examples: let me produce vnto you but two out of hundreds,

namely of Cato the elder, and of Tullie. What a notable man was Cat

                the elder? He had that commendation given vnto him by cōsent, which none in his time was thought to deserue, to be optimus orator, optimus senator, & optimus imperator (as Plinie reporteth)
               Plinius.

               parable a man was so much given to boast himselfe, that his veriest friendes were ashamed of him. As for Tullie he was so excellently qualisied, that none but a Tullie, that is, one admirably eloquent, is sufficient to speake of his worthines. And yet this is not left vnremē
               bred by them, that were willing to cō

            That such doe offend God (not only are displeasing to men) may appeare heereby. First for that God doth expressely forbidde it, as in my texte, and in diverse other places of the scripture. Secondly for that hee hath sharpely punished this sin, not only in his enemies, as in olde-Babel, for boasting, and saying: I am, and none else, I shall be a Lady
               Esaie 47. 
               for ever: & in new Babel, for her proud names of blasphemie, whereof this was one, as Hierō saith, Roma aterna, Rome

               Thirdly for that the saints of God haue greatly abhorred this vice, & refrained it, as much as might bee: as S. Paule to the Galath. God forbidde, that I shoulde
               Galat▪ 6.

               If I must needes glory, I will glory of mine infirmities: that is, I wil bee farre from carnail boasting. Lastlie for that God hath wrought this instinct, or law of nature in the very heathen to cō demne it. As namely Tullie, vvhome I toulde you of even now, howsoever he fell in practise, yet when he spake from his booke, he colde say: Deforme est de

him, and so farre out of his bookes, we have not seene. You shal vnderstande therfore, that God hateth pride and all that pertaieneth to it, not of any emulation, for who can come neere vnto God, within any degree of comparisō, that he should be afraid of him? (emulation is a kinde of feare of the worth or rising of another, least he should toppe vs) but of pure justice, and for the due demerite of the sinne. For shall the ax

               . Hee that killeth the wicked parent, & spareth his vngracious brattes is a very foole. This iustice appeareth to be in God toward pride & her daughters▪ he hateth both the one, & the other: yea he hateth al them, that be in loue with either. I shal not neede to proue that vaine glory is prides own daughter, for that were to proue a crab to come of a crab tree, or a blacke berie of a brier, or drosse of the corruption of metal, or skumme of the vncleanes of the meat. What is choler else, say they, thē the froath of blood, spuma sanguinis? & so what is glorying else, but a very froath of pride? they froath out their owne shame, while they boile vp with their owne praises: & if vaunting bee in the branch, vanity is in the roote, that is certaine. Al boasting therfore is to be avoided, and abhorred as bad, fruit of a bad tree: & if al boasting, then boasting of wisedome, or strength, or riches, as it followeth in my text. Let not the vvise glory in his wisedome &c.
            
               Of boasting in general we haue spokē inough already, now let vs see more particularely, what bee the things that he forbiddeth vs to boast of▪ The prophet setteth downe. 3. the first wisdome: the second strength, the third riches. Of these I am to speake in order. Quod gene ri attributum est etiam in species redū
                  dat, saith Tertullian. That which is true in the generall, will bee found true in the speciall, or particular vvith advantage. For as much therfore as I haue proved already that boasting in general is vnlawful, I shal not need to proue seriously or amply, that it is vnlawful to boast of these particulars, wisdome, strength, or riches: only a fleight skimming over the points may serue the turne.
            Of wisedome first this I haue to say: that of al the gifts, wherewith the Lord doth beautifie the soule of man, none seemeth to be cōparable to it: sure I am none ought to bee preferred before it. For it is the very sterne of our vessel, the very sunne of our firmament, the verie

eie of our head, the very hart of our bo dy. Where wisedome sittteth at the sterne there matters are ordered in a probable course to a laudable end. But where wisedome is wanting, there the sunne goeth downe at noone day (to vse the Prophets wordes) there the light, that is in vs is turned into darkenes, as Christ speaketh, & then how great is the darkenes? So thought Lactantius. Vt sol

                   lumē est cordis humani. As the sunne is the light of our eies, so the light of our hart is wisedome: So thought the Poet.

               .Phocylid 
               Fieldes, townes, ships are all managed & governed by vvisedome. Wisedome therfore is a most precious thing: that is certaine: & the merchādise
               Pro. 3. 
               therof is better then silver, & the gaine therof is better then golde, as Salomon saith: but not to bee boasted of for all that.
            And why? First because it is not our owne, or of our selues: as Cyprian saith:Cypriam. 
               De nullo gloriandum, quia nostrum nihil
               
               est. VVee are to boast of nothing because nothing is our owne, or of our selues. And Augustine vpon Iohn saith: Christ saide not, without me yee can do little, but with out me yee can doe nothing. Where then is glorying? is it not excluded? For if it were lawful to boast of that, which is not our owne, then the crowe might haue beene iustified for brauing it with her borowed or stollen feathers (furtivis coloribus) & the asse for ietting with the Lions skinne about him, & the ape for skipping vp & downe in his masters iacket. But now these were ridiculous in so doing, therfore we cānot reasonablie boast of that which is not our own: except we wil be like to these vnreasonable beastes. Let this be the first reason against glorying in wisedome.
            The second this: Our wisedome is many waies vnperfect, therfore, if wee be wise, we will not bragge of it. For wil any bragge of his lame legge, or his one cie? Indeede now I remember Agesilaus
               Plutarch. in Ages. et Sert. bragged of his club-foote, & had never

done bragging of it. Also Sertorius brag ged of his one eie, and had never done bragging of it but by their leaue I think this their bragging was but from the teeth outward, and rather to prevent, and forestall others from gibing, then of any delighte they tooke there in themselues (bragging lightly breaketh not fourth, but some inward ioy, or tickling helpeth it forwarde) and therefore it was like to the same Sardonius risus. And notwithstanding that exception, the proposition remaineth firme, that wee boast not naturally or vsually of our infirmities, or imperfections. But now our wisdome is vnperfect, & very vnperfect, why thē should any boast of it? That it is vnperfect S. Paule sheweth. 1. Cor 13 VVe know in

of the Aegyptians themselues, & of the English and al; for vnderstanding wee are but children. I grant that in al ages, and in al nations some haue gone away with the name of wisdome, as that Romane that was called Corculum (Nosica was so called) that Greciā that was called

                  c. young men of Ionia standing vpon the sea shoare and beholding fishermē making of a draught▪ agreed with thē a great for their draught, that what they should hale vp to land in their net should bee theirs. Nowe it was so by Gods providence, that togither with certaine fish, they encloased a certaine peece of plate (which no mā knew whē it was suncke there) and dragged tho same to land in their net. The same being claimed & seased vpon by the yoūg men, by vertue of their bargaine, they cast betweene them how to dispose of it. But whē they could not agree about the sharing of it, they sent to the Oracle for resolution from thence. They were returned answere frō the Oracle to sende it to the wisest. They sende it therefore to Thales their cuntryman: a mā of great note in those daies for wisdome.

But whē it was brought to him, he disabled himselfe, and disclamed the name of wise: and sent it to an other as being more wise then he was. The second also he would none of it, but sent it to a third, & the third to a fourth, &c and so they posted it of from one to an other, vntil sevē had it. The seventh & last Solon, hee made no more a doe but sent it to the tēple at Delphi for a present to God, as acknowledging him only to be wise. A mervailous confession for heathen men to make touching the alone wisdome of God. And thus God, that ordaineth his praise out of the

               mouthes of babes and sucklings as it is in the Psalme, & made the domb beast speaking

therfore touching matters of learning is vnperfect, you heare by the cōfessiō of the wisest, and therefore not to bee boasted of.
            So is it vncertaine concerning matters of policie, & therefore this a third reason why it ought not to bee gloried in. Prudens futuri tempo

also of the whole house of God. But the way of man is not in him selfe as Ieremie

by Plinie, who slewe 300.

These were famous men in their generations, for strength & no doubt they were mervailously admired at by thē, that liued in their times: Yet for al that nether wereothers to haue gloried in thē, nor they in thēselues. Not others to glory in thē: because Paule saith Let

                (

               ) And againe Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord. 1 Cor. 10. Not thēselus to glory in thēselus, because strēgth is not to be cōpared to wisdōe, & therfore wisedome being debarred frō boasting (as you heard already) strēgth ought much more. That strēgth cōmeth short of wis dome Salomon sheweth both by plaine wordes and by an example. By plaineEccles. 9. 14. 16. words as when hee saith Eccles. 9. 16.

               Thē said I, better is wisdom thē strēgth. By an example: as in the same chapter, ver. 14. A little cittie, and few men in it, and a great king came against it, and compassed it about, and builded fortes against it. And there was found therein a poore & wise man, and hee delivered the cittie by his wisedome. Thus Salomon. Nature also hath taught as much, both in plaine words: and by examples. In plaine wordes, as Musaeus:

                  . 
               VVisdom or sleight is alwaies better then strength. By an example as Sertorius for example. Hee caused a couple of horses to be brought before him, the one fat and fleshy, the other a leane carion iade: also a couple of souldiers the one strong, & lustie the other a silly sickely fellow: to the leane horse he put the strong man, & he going roughly to worke, and thinking to do the deed with dead strength, haled, and pulled, and tired himselfe, and was a laughing stocke to the beholders: but the weake fellow vsing some cunning,

for al his weaknes did the feat, & went his way with the applause. Wisedome therefore is better then strength: and therefore this is one strong reason why strength should not be boasted of since wisdom is denied. An other reasō may be this: strength or force, be it equal to the strength of a Lion or Elephant, yet it is but the strength of flesh, never the lesse: and al flesh is fraile, and subiect to foile. When one cānot overcome, many may. Whom sword cannot pearce, shot wil: whom shot doth not hit, sicknes may arrest, time surely, and death wi be sure to make an ende of. Nowe should a man bee prowde of grasse, of vapor, of smoake, of a shadow, of a tale that is told, &c. whereto the whole life of man, and his glory, and consequently his strength & vigor, are compared? An horse is but a race, they say, and so the strongest man vpō earth is but the push of a pike, or the clappe of a pistol. Were not Abimelech and Pyrrhus, twoIudg. 9. most valiant princes, either of them killed

by the hand of a woman? was not Totilas that noble conquerour, that had vanquished Rome, which had vanquished the whole world, vvas not hee I say overcome, and slaine by Narses an eununch, a semivir? vvhat should I stand any longer vpon this? God hath1▪ Cor▪ 1. chosē, as the foolish things of the world to cōfound the wise, so the weak things of the world many times to confounde the strong. And this may be a third rea son against glorying in strength, because God himself doth many times set himselfe against the mighty.

This mighte bee easilie vouched by sundrie examples, but that the time

being so farre spent, it is time to come to the third special thing, that wee are forbidden, to glory in, to witte riches. Nor the rich man glory in his riches.
            
            As I gaue this for one reason, whie strength shoulde not be gloried in, because it is not to be compared to wisedōe, which I had proved before might not bee allowed to boaste: so I may assigne this for one cause why riches should not be boasted of, because they are not comparable to strength, which even now I excluded from glorying.

                to pray againstPro. 30. fulnes? but to shewe, that as they must haue good brains, that wil carry much drinke, so they must haue extraordinarie soules, that wil not be overcome of the world. Did not David in his prosperityPsal. 30. say that he should never be removed? did he not saie or speak vnadvisedly? nay did he not doe lewdly and wickedly, defiling himselfe with his neighbours wife: and embrewing his hands in his servitors blood, thus adding mur ther to adultrie? Did he attempt anie such thing in the daies of wāt, & adversity? No no, in his necessitie he sought the Lord, & got himselfe vnto his God right earely: & offred to him the sacrifice of righteousnes. And yet we grudge and repine, when we doe not swim in wealth, when wealth through the corruption of our nature doth dul vs, and

tainte vs, and make vs vnapt to every good work. Again we shun poverty, as we would do a serpent, nay as the gates of hel, when yet povertie through the blessing of God doth kindle devotion, and kil sin in vs, even as wormewood, or the like bitter thinges kill moathes, or wormes. This the time wil not permit me to stād any lōger vpon: & therfore I come at once to the secōd verse, and wil end the same in a word or two.
            
               Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he vnderstandeth, & knoweth me. Mans wisdome, strength, & riches are vaine, and not to be boasted of, thus much Ieremie hath told vs already, and I haue proved to you by many reasons: but now if you wold know; what is the thing, wherein we may take true comfort, & wherof we may safely glory, the same is no other thing but pietie, and godlines, the true knowledge of God,1. Tim. 4. the true service of God: this hath the promise of this life & of the lif to come. this we ought to labor for, day, & night

that vve maie attaine it, and having attained it, we maie reioice vvith ioy vnspeakable, & glorious. This our Savior Christ doth warrāt vs to do by his ownLuk. 10. 21. example, Luk. 10. Who there is said to haue reioiced in the spirite on our behalfe, because we had our mindes illuminate to vnderstād those things, that belong to the kingdome of God, & our salvatiō. Even as elsewhere he defineth the happines of man to consist herein, namelie to knowe God the only true God,

Vnhappy is the mā, that knoweth all those things (al secular learning) if he knowe not thee, but happy is he that knoweth thee, although he be ignorant of the rest. But hee that knoweth thee, and the rest to, is never a whit the more blessed for the other thinges sake, but for thee only, if knowing thee he glorifie thee as God: so Augustine. The

knowledge of God therefore, that is the one thing, that is necessarie, that maketh a man a Christian, that lifteth vs vp vnto God, that coupleth vs vnto him, that iustifieth, that saveth, that worketh al in all. Now by knowledge I vnderstand, & the prophet in my texte vnderstandeth, not a bare apprehensiō or sense of the minde, that there is a divine power greater, and mightier then al, for so much the most barbarous hea then were not with out. they coulde saie Deus videt omnia.

that craue it for his Sons sake, & lastlie touching his bountie, that he wil everlastinglie rewarde as manie, as are his, even as manie, as beleeue in his name. This is that saving knowledge, which the world knoweth not, neither is it revealed by flesh, and bloode, but by the spirit of the father, which is in heauen. This is that knowledge vvhereof the Prophet Esaie speaketh: By his knoweledge shall my righteous servant iustifie

This is that knowledge, that preciousMat. 13. treasure which so soone as a wise man findeth, for ioy thereof he departeth, & selleth all, that hee hath, and buyeth the field. Brieflie this is that knowledge, inPhil. 3. comparison wherof S. Paul counted all things lost, even dunge, that hee might know Christ, and the vertue of his resurrection, and the vertue of his afflictions, and bee made conformable to his death. To conclude this is that knowledge, which whosoever seeketh is wise, whosoever getteth is rich, whosoever

keepeth is strong, nay vertuous, nay happy, nay twise happie: happy he is in this world by faith, and happie in the world to come he shalbe by fruition. This knowledge the Lorde vouchsafe to engraffe in them, that want it, & increase it in thē, that haue it, & make it fruitful in al: to the purging of our cō sciences in this life, & the saving of our soules in the daie of our Lord Iesus: to whom with the Father, and the blessed Spirit be al honor, and glory. Amen.
