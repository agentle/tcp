                  By breath of life that God did breath,
                  in nostrils of the man.
                  And from the first god planted had,
                  a garden faire to see:
                  Wherein he set this man he made,
                  the keeper for to be.
                  And frō ye earth god made to spring

                  and please the mouth in tast.
                  Two trees amid this garden grew,
                  by power of sacred skill:
                  The one of life, the other was
                  of knowledge good & ill.
                  From Eden went a riuer forth,
                  to moist this garden than:
                  Which afterward deuided was,
                  and in foure heads became.
                  And Pishon is the first of foure,
                  which round about doth go,
                  The golden land of Hauilah,

                  with water round about.
                  
                     
The third is named Hidekell,
                  that passeth downe along
                  The east side of Assyria,
                  with mightie streame and strong.
                  And Euphrates the fourth is cald,
                  which fruitfulnesse doth shew,
                  And in the same doth many gems,
                  and pretious stones forth grow.
                  Almighty God this Adam tooke
                  and in this garden set:
                  The same to dresse, the same to keep
                  and of the fruit to eate.
                  Of euery tree that therein was,
                  God bade him eate his fill,
                  Except the tree that's in the midst,
                  of knowledge good and ill.
                  God said, ye day thou eat'st thereof
                  thou for the same shalt die:
                  Therefore see that thou touch it not

               In which was borne the sonne of God,
               as was his will to doe.
               So must that glorious court,
               of that high potentat,
               King Cresus he of Lydia,
               stand backe to this estate.

               Which though they garnisht were
               most magnificentlie:
               With fine and curious workmanship,
               of marble imag'rie:

               as subiects bond and thrall,
               
                  
As no whit to compared be,
               to this in ought at all.
               Let Lady Rome strike saile,
               and vnder hatches go,
               With stately turrets of defense,

               Of such an holy birth,

               be thought a whit the lesse,
               Meet to receiue the Sauiour
               of all our trespasses.
               For that the walles thereof,
               were broken or berent:
               Subiect to wind and weather such,
               as stormes and tempest sent.
               Neither for that it was
               without all furniture:
               As sheetes and other-needfull things,
               as dayly be in vre.
               Hauing but only this,
               which there by chance they found,
               Offtebble rough, and thistle hay,
               that lay vpon the ground.
               And notwithstanding this,
               as you haue heard beforne:
               
                  
Did yet receiue this little babe,

               For such an homely crib,
               and stable poore and thin,
               Did well become our sauiour Christ,
               for to be borne therein.
               As he that to the world,
               came hyther purposely:
               To giue example vnto vs,

Of delicates and iunkets fine,

               yee shall not here behold,

               in siluer, silke, ne gold.
               Nor yet the childwife lie,
               in soft and stately bed:
               With quilts of silke to keepe hir warme,
               nor pillow for hir hed.
               No, no, but here doth lie,
               in manger hard and cold:

               more sweet than may be told.
               Bewrapt and lapt in clouts,

               And swathed in such swathing clothes,

               Nor at aduenture, and by chance,
               as names are commonly.
               Nor was it giuen by man,
               but by an angel sent
               To tell of my Natiuitie,
               the purpose and intent.
               And vnder heauen there is

               he able is to stand.
               
                  
And euery man besides,
               that liues in common wealth,
               As some by skil, and some by strength,
               through power of noble health,
               The same likewise supports,
               in order as they ought:
               And but for health all gouernments
               to ruine come and naught.
               If health be done away,
               then life is worse than death,
               For death makes end of sorrowes all,
               by stopping of the breath.
               Of earthly treasures all,
               health is to be preferd
               Before all thinges that eie hath seene,
               or eare hath euer heard.
            
            
               A Question would I aske,
               thereby not to offend:
               What is the cause that physicks art,
               cannot old age defend?
               By cunning and by skill,
               great cures ye doo each day:
               But age will not remoued be,
               nor yet kept at a stay.
               No physicks art ne drug,
               nor potion can ye make:
               Can force old age for to exchange,
               the place that he doth take.
               
                  
Age stealeth on vs so,
               yer ye can doo vs good:
               That suddenly it quailes the strength,
               and dooth forestall the blood.
               Whereby the humour fresh
               is brought vnto decay:
               And gallant vigor of the mind,
               is forst to flie awaie.
               And looke what lustie age,
               in yoonger yeares brought forth,
               The same old age hath cleane defac't,
               and made it nothing worth.
               A thousand maladies
               vpon old age depend:
               Which peecemeale wise away do pluck

And sooner than we knew
               or felt the life we craue:
               We are forbidden by and by,
               a longer life to haue.
               Yet beasts of sundry kindes,
               and fowles aloft that flie,
               Aboue two hundred yeares doe liue,
               before that they doo die.
               The stag, the bucke, the Rauen,
               the Elephant also,
               So long doe liue in lustie plight,
               and healthfullie doe shew.
               But man, alas poore man,
               before that he may clime
               To fifty yeares, his bodily strength,
               doth very much decline.
               And if that he may reach
               to threescore yeares or more:
               His waining wit and memorie
               is weaker than before.
               The Thebans held a law,
               who threescore yeares did liue:
               If after that he then fell sicke,
               none might him physicke giue.
               That age obtainde, say they,
               himselfe ought not to bend,
               Longer to liue, but hasten forth,
               vnto his iournies end.
               Experience dooth confirme,
               
                  
and proueth this too true:
               That lately such as lustie were,
               in valor, strength, and hue,
               Are now through age become,
               all crooked to behold:
               Their heads with white bespeckled are,
               their heat is turnde to cold.
               The frost their beards hath caught,
               which maketh them to thinke,
               How that the spring of their greene age,
               is past and still doth shrinke.
            
            
               OFlitting youth adieu,
               age makes all things decline:
               O too too short a fading floure,
               of transitorie time:
               Which by no waie nor art,
               can be repair'd againe:
               The winter cold the heat hath nipt,
               and ransackt euerie vaine.
               O greene and sprouting yeares,
               ô gallant youth that's past:
               What sweet and pleasant merry daies,
               were spent while you did last?
               O happy time of life,
               how slily doth it passe:
               And steales away making exchange
               for purest gold but brasse.
               How closely is it gone,
               
                  
and not perceiu'd at all:
               And glides away as doe the streames,
               which downe a riuer fall?
               More swift it may be said,
               than emptie clouds that flie
               By force of winds that tosse them roun

               of that we dreamt to bee.

               now delicate in sight:
               Within short time all withered is,
               and turnd as daie to night.
               And so likewise of man,
               from child to man doth grow:
               From man againe a childe becoms,

               of rough and raging seas.
               Death is vnto the euill,
               a whip of smarting paine:
               And to the good a sweet reward,
               of euerlasting gaine.
            
            
               THe common custome is,
               to flatter them that liue:
               And of the dead reprochfull words,
               and ill reports to giue.
               But sure the fault is great,
               to speake ill of the dead,
               Who harme them not but quietlie,
               doe rest within their bed.
               As no man is so good,
               but better might haue beene:
               So no man liues that is so bad,
               but worsser name might win.
               For as there is some cause,
               a man for to dispraise:
               So in the same some vertue dwels
               that his renowme might raise.
               And therefore of the dead,
               I wish to speake the best:
               And praise the vertues which they
