Thanne as to the firſte cauſe he was borne to geue men peeſe of good wyll I may well preue this for whan he was borne angellys ſonghe thus Gloria in excelſia deo &c. Ioye be to god in heuen & peſe in erth to man kynd of good wyll

At midnighte oure lord was borne for be kynde all thyng was in pees & reſte inſhewyng that he was and is Princepa pacia Prince of peeſe & come to make pees be twyxe god and man and be twyxe the angell and man and be twyx man and man And for to be trew mediatour be twyx god and man he toke natur and kynde of bothe and was bothe verray god 
                  and man and by his mediacion he knette the loue of god to man ſo ſaddely that the fadyr of heuyn ſparyd not hym that is his owne but ſente hym in to this worlde to bye man kynde with his precious blode thourghe his grete mekeneſſe to ioye of paradyſe that man hadde loſte be couetyſe of vnbuxſumnes.
               Thus he made pees be twyx god 
                  and man and man and man. for whanne angeles ſay her lord wrothe with man for his vnburſumnes for it is a ſynne that angeles hatyn gretly. Ther fore they kepte the gatys of paradyſe and wolde lette no ſoule come ynne tyll they ſay her lord borne of man kynde Thanne a none for loue of our lord the angels did mankynde worſhippe & ſpake goodly to mankynde as to the ſheperdys that keptyn her ſhepe in the countre by They bad hem go to the cite of Bethlem and ther they ſhuld fynde a childe borne and leyde in a crache and bad hem do hym worſhippe and ſo they dedyn And euer ſyn angelys haue ben frendely to man and lowly end haue done reuerence to mankynde for the incarnacion of oure lord iheſu criſte.

                  ſhewid this to the Emperour ſhe ſeyd to hym this childe ſhall be gretter than thos arte or euer were or euer ſhall be and ther fore do hym worſhippe and reuerence Than a none the emperour toke enſence and dede worſhippe to hym and charged all the people to do the ſame and to calle the childe her god & hym but a man as othir were. Thus all criſten people may lerne to do worſhippe and ſeruice to this childe this day And ther fore the thyrde maſſe this day is ſeyd at myd day in tokenyng that criſten people ſhulde come and offer in the worſhippe of this childe and his modyr and ſhewen hym ſeruaunt and ſuget to hym and knoleche this childe for his lord
