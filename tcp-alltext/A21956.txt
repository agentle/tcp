Depredations vpon the Sea.
            
               THE Queenes Maiestie being certainely informed, through the manifold
and dayly complaints made to her Highnesse, aswell by her owne Subiects, as others, of
the continuall Depredations and Piracies committed on the Seas, by certaine lewde
and ill disposed persons, pretending to make warre against the enemies of her Maiestie,
and of this Estate; And finding that the ordinary Proceedings helde of late times for the
suppressing of these enormities, and offences, haue wrought lesse reformation then was
expected; In her princely care to preserue Iustice, as one of the maine pillars of her estate,
and for the speedier repressing of al such Piracies and Depredations, crimes most hateful
to her minde, & scandalous to her peaceable gouernment, And for the better continuance
of amitie with al other Princes and States, not enemies to her Maiestie: Hath with the aduise of her Priuie Counsel not
only bene at charges some few moneths since, to send out a Pinnace of her owne now in the Straits to search those seas
for such offenders, and to vse all good meanes by force, or otherwise to take and bring home all such of her Subiects, as being
Pirates doe robbe and spoile the Subiects of her friendes, not any way caring to obey any Lawes, or other Orders
lately published vpon the growing on of these fowle crimes, and Piracies, coloured by other Uoyages; But also for preuention
of any more such lewde purposes in any that are to goe foorth, Hath set downe certaine Articles hereafter following,
Which her Highnesse commandeth all her Officers whom it may concerne, of what degree soeuer, to see duely
executed: Wherein if any maner of person shalbe found culpable, or wilfully negligent, Her Maiestie declareth hereby,
