               Mary that you shall not speake the Prologue Sir.
            
            
               3.
               Why? do you hope to speake it?
            
            
               2.
               I, & I thinke I haue most right to it; I am sure I studied it first.
            
            
               3.
               Thats all one, if the Author thinke I can speake it better.
            
            
               1.
               I plead possession of the Cloake: Gentles, your suffrages for
Gods sake.
               Why Children, are you not ashamd? come in there.

               1.
               Why? will you stand to most voyces of the Gentlemen? let that
decide it.
            
            
               3.
               O no Sir Gallant; you presume to haue the start of vs there, and
that makes you offer so bountifully.
            
            
               1.
               No, would I were whipt, if I had any such thought; trye it by
Lots eyther.

               Faith, I dare tempt my Fortune in a greater venter then this.

               1.
               But will you not snatch my Cloake while I am stooping?

               Which Cut shall speake it?
            
            
               3.
               The shortest.

Scene, GARGAPHIA: which I do vehemently suspect for some

               Good Sir. But what will you say now, if a Poet (vntoucht with
any breath of this disease) finde Gods Tokens vpon you, that are of
the Auditory? As some one Ciuet-Wit among you, that knowes no other
Learning, then the price of Satten and Veluets; nor other Perfection,
then the wearing of a Neate Sute; & yet will censure as desperately
as the most profest Critique in the house: presuming, his Cloathes
should beare him out in't. Another (whome it hath pleas'd Nature
to furnish with more Beard, then Brayne) prunes his Mustaccio;
lispes; and (with some score of affected Oathes) sweares downe all that sit
about him; That the olde Hieronimo, (as it was first acted) was
the onely best, and Iudiciously-pend Play, of Europe. A thirde
great-bellied Iugler talkes of twenty yeares since, and when Monsieur
was here; and would enforce all Witte to be of that fashion, because
his Doublet is still so. A fourth mis-calles all by the name of Fustian,
that his grounded Capacity cannot aspire too. A fifth only
shakes his Bottle Head, and out of his Corky Braine, squeezeth out
a pittifull-learned Face, and is silent.

whisper a light message to a loose wenche with some round
volubility, waite at a table with a Trencher, and warble vpon a
Crowde a little; One that sweepes the Gods drinking roome
euery morning, and sets the Cushions in order againe which
they threw one at anothers head ouernight? Heere's the Catalogue
of all your Imploiments now. O no, I erre: you haue the
Marshalling of all the Ghostes too, that passe the Stigian ferry;
and I suspect you for a share with the olde Sculler there, if the
truth were knowne; but let that scape: one other peculiar vertue
you possesse▪ in lifting or Lieger-du-maine (which few of the

house of Heauen haue else besides) I must confesse; But (me
thinks) that should not make you set such an extream distance
twixt your selfe and others, that we should be said too ouerdare

challenge a priority of vs both, because he can throw the Barre
farther▪ or lift more Ioyndstooles at the armes end then we. If

imbrace you, and (to speake by Metaphore) you borrowed a
Girdle of hers, as you did Ioues Scepter (while he was laughing)

your hook'd tallons in practise with any thing. Slight, now

                  O Hermes, your craft cannot make me confident, I know
my owne steele to be almost spent, and therefore intreate my
peace with you in time: you are too cunning for me to incounter
at length, and I thinke it my safest warde to close.

where (if my bowe holde, and my shafts flye but with halfe

I shall really redeeme the minutes I haue lost by their so long
and ouer-nice proscription of my Deity, from their court.

so violent a dispatch?

                  Why this was most vnexpectedly followed (my deuine
delicate Mercury) by the Beard of Ioue, thou art a pretious
Deity.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Nay Cupid leaue to speake improperly; since we are
turn'd cracks, lets study to be like cracks: practise their language,
and behauiours, and not with a dead Imitation. Acte
freely, carelesly, and capricciously, as if our veines ranne with
Quick-siluer, and not vtter a phrase, but what shall come foorth
steept in the very brine of conceipt, and sparkle like salt in fire.

                  That's not euery ones happinesse (Hermes) though you
can presume vpon the

                     asinesse and dexterity of your wit, you
shall giue me leaue to be a little Iealous of mine; and not desperately
to hazard it after your capring humor.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Nay then Cupid, I thinke we must haue you hoodwinckt
againe, for you are growne too prouident, since your
eyes were at liberty.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Not so (Mercury) I am still blinde Cupid to thee:
               
               
                  Mer.
                  And what to the Lady Nimph you serue?

                  Troath Page, Boy, and Sirha: these are all my titles.

                  O No, that had bin Supererogation, you shall neuer heare
your Courtier call but by one of these three.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Faith then both our Fortunes are the same.
               
               
                  
                  Cup.
                  Why? what parcell of man hast thou lighted on for
a Maister?
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Such a one (as before I begin to decipher him) I dare
not affirme him to be any thing else then a Courtier. So much
he is, during this open time of Reuels, & would be longer, but
that his meanes are to leaue him shortly after: his name is Hedon,
a gallant wholy consecrated to his pleasures.—

                  Mer.
                  How is she cal'd, and then I can shew thee?

That will make her proud. And a fifth shall conclude: Then do I

Whoring, and such like; neuer kneeles, but to pledge Health's

                  Come Sir. You are now within reguarde of the Presence,
And see, the priuacie of this roome, how sweetly it offers

it offers it selfe to our retir'd intendments, Page, cast a vigilant,
and enquiring eye about, that we be not rudely surpris'd, by
the aproch of some ruder-stranger.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  I warrant you Sir. Ile tell you when the Woolfe enters feare nothing.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  O what a masse of benefit shall we possesse, in being
the inuisible Spectators of this strange shew now to be acted?
               
               
                  Amor
                  Plant your selfe there Sir: And obserue me. You shall
now, as well be the Ocular as the Eare-witnesse, how clearely
I can refell that Paradox, or rather Pseudodoxe of those, which
holde the face to be the Index of the minde, which (I assure
you) is not so, in any Politique creature; for Instance, I wil now
giue you the particuler, and distinct face of euery your most
noted Species of persons; As your Marchant, your Schol
                           •
                        er, your
Soldier, your Lawyer, Courtier, &c. And each of these so truly, as
you would sweare (but that your eye sees the variation of the
lineament) it were my most proper, and Genuine aspect: 
                        〈…〉
                     
for your Marchants, or Citty face; Tis thus: a dull 
                        〈…〉
                     
face; still looking in a direct line, forward: There is no 
                        〈…〉
                     
matter in this face. Then haue you your Students, or Ac
                           •
                        demique
face, which is here, an honest, simple, and Methodicall
face; But somewhat more spread then the former. The third
is your Soldiers face: A menacing, and astounding face, that
lookes broade, and bigge: the grace of this face consists much
in a Beard. The Anti face to this, is your Lawyers face; a contracted,
subtile, and Intricate face: full of quirkes, and turnings;
A Labyrinthaean face, now angularly, now circularly, euery way
aspected. Next is your Statists face, a serious, solempne, and
supercilious face, ful of formall, and square grauity▪ the eye (for
the most part) arteficially and deeply shadow'd, there is great
iudgment requir'd in the making of this face. But now to come
to your face of faces; or Courtiers face: tis of three sorts: (according
to our subdiuision of a Courtier; Elementary, Practique,
and Theorique: your Courtier Theorique, is he that hath arriu'd
to his fardest, and doth now know the Court rather by speculation,
then practise; & this is his face: A fastidious, and oblique
face; that lookes, as it went with a Vice, and were screw'd thus.
Your Courtier Practique is he that is yet in his Path, his Course,
his Way, & hath not toucht the Puntillio or point of hopes; this

face is here: A most promising, open, smooth, and ouerflowing
face, that seemes as it would runne, and powre it selfe into you;
your Courtier Elementary is one but newly entered, or as it were
in the Alphabet Vt-re-mi-fa-sol-la, of Courtship: Note well this
face, for it is this you must practise.
               
               
                  Asot.
                  Ile practise 'hem all, if you please Sir.
               
               
                  Amor.
                  I; here after you may: and it will not be altogether an
vngratfull study. For let your soule be assur'd of this (in any
Ranke or profession whatsoeuer) the most generall, or Maior
part of Opiniō, goes with the face, & (simply) respects nothing
else. Therefore: if that can be made, exactly, curiously, exquisitely,
thoroughly, It is enough: But (for the present) you shall
only apply your selfe to this face of the Elementary Courtier, A
light, reuelling, & protesting face, now blushing, now smiling
which you may helpe much with a wanton wagging of your
head, thus; (a feather will teach you) or with kissing your finger
that hath the Ruby, or playing with some string of your band▪
which is a most quaint kinde of Melancholy besides. Where is
your Page? call for your Casting Bottle, and place your Mirror
in your Hat, as I tolde you; so. Come, looke not pale, obserue
me: set your face, and enter,

                  What's he Mercury?
                  
               
               
                  Mer.
                  A notable Finch. One that hath newly entertain'd the
Beggar to follow him, but cannot get him to wait neer inough.
Tis Asotus the heire of Philargirus: but first Ile giue you the
others Caracter, which may make his the clearer? He that is
with him is Amorphus, A Traueller, One so made out of the
mixture and shreds of formes, that himselfe is truely deformed:
Hee walkes most commonlye with a Cloue or Picktoothe
in his mouth, Hee's the very Minte of Compl
                           •
                        ment;
                     
All his behauiours are printed, his face is another volume of
Essayes; and his beard an Aristarchus. He speakes all creame,
skimd, & more affected then a dozen of waiting women; Hee's
his owne promooter in euery place: The wife of the Ordinary
giues him his diet to maintaine her table in discourse, which
(indeed) is a meere Tiranny ouer her other guests: for he will
vsurp all the talke: Ten Cunstables are not so tedious. He is no
great shifter; once a yeare his Apparell is ready to reuolt; He
doth vse much to arbitrate quarrells, and fights himselfe exceeding
well (out at a window.) He will lie cheaper then any
Begger, and lowder then most Clockes; for which he is right
properly accommodated to the W
                           •
                        etstone his page. The other
gallant is his Zani, & doth most of these tricks after him; sweats
to imitate him in euery thing (to a haire) except a Beard, which
is not yet extant: he doth learne to eat Anchoues, & Caueare because
he loues 'hem, speakes as he speakes; lookes, walkes, goes
so in Cloathes and fashion, is in al, as he were moulded of him.
Marry (before they met) he had other very pretty sufficiencies,
which yet he retaines some light Impression of: As frequenting
a dauncing schoole, and grieuously torturing strangers,
with inquisitiō after his grace in his Galliard; He buyes a fresh
acquaintance at any rate; his Eye, and his Raiment confer much
together as he goes in the street; He treads nicely, like a fellow
that walkes vpon ropes, especially the first Sunday of his Silkstockings,
and when he is most neate and new, you shal stripp
him with commendations.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Here comes another.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  I, but one of another straine Cupid: This fellow
weighs somewhat.
               
               
                  Criticus passeth by.
               
                  Cup.
                  His name Hermes?
                  
               
               
                  Mer.
                  
                     Criticus. A creature of a most perfect and diuine temper;
One, in whom the Humors & Elements are peaceably met,
without aemulation of Precedencie: he is neither too fantastickly
Melancholy; too slowly Plegmatick, too lightly Sanguine,
or too rashly Cholerick, but m al, so composd and order'd; as it is
cleare, Nature was about some full worke, she did more then

make a man when she made him; His discourse is like his behauiour,
vncommon, but not vnpleasing; he is prodigall of neither:
He striues rather to be (that which men call) Iudicious,
then to be thought so; and is so truely learned that he affects
not to shew it: He wil thinke, & speak his thought, both freely;
but as distant frō deprauing any other mans Merrit, as proclaming
his owne: For his valor, tis such, that he dares as little to
offer an Iniury, as receiue one. In sum, he hath a most Ingenious
and sweet spirit, a sharp and season'd wit, a streight iudgement.
and a strong minde; constant and vnshaken: Fortune
could neuer breake him, or make him lesse, he counts it his
pleasure to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good
deedes then Goods, It is a competencie to him that he can be
vertuous. He doth neither couet, nor feare; he hath too much
reason to do either: and that commends all things to him.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Not better then Mercury commends him.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  O Cupid, 'tis beyond my deity to giue him his due
praises; I could leaue my Place in heauen, to liue among Mortals,
so I were sure to bee no other then he.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Slight, I beleeue he is your Minion; you seeme to be so
rauisht with him.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Hee's one, I would not haue awry thought darted against
willingly.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  No, but a straight shaft in his bosome, Ile promise him,
if I am Cithereas sonne.

                  Cup.
                  Stay and see the Ladies now; theile come presently. Ile
helpe to paint them.

                  The same: A Nimph of a most wandering and giddy
disposition, humourous as the Ayre, she'le run from Gallant to
Gallant (as they sit at Primero in the Presence) most strangely,
and seldome stayes with any; She spreades as she goes: To day

you shall haue her looke as cleare and fresh as the morning
and to morrow as Melancholy as midnight. She takes speciall
pleasure in a close, obscure lodging, and for that cause visits
the Cittie so often, where shee has many secret and true-concealing
fauorites. When she comes abroad shee's more loose
and scattering then dust, and will fly from place to place, as she
were rapt with a whirle-winde. Your young Student (for the
most part) she affects not, onely salutes him▪ and away: A Poet
or a Philosopher she is hardly brought to take any notice of, no,
though he be some part of an Alchimist. She loues a Player,
well; and a Lawyer infinitly: but your Foole aboue all. She can
do much in the Court for the obtaining of any sute whatsoeuer,
no doore but flies open to her; her presence is aboue a
Charme: The woorst in her is want of keeping s

                     She will tell you Philosophy was a fine Reueller, when she
was young and a Gallant, and that then (though she say it) she was
thought to be the Dame-Dido, and Hallen of the Court; As also,
what a sweete Dogge she had this time foure yeere, and how it was
call'd Fortune, and that (if the fates had not cut his thred) he had
beene a Dogge to haue giuen entertainement to any Gallant in this

                  O, that's my Lady and Mistris Madam Philautia: She
admires not herselfe for any one particularity, but for all; She
is faire, and she knowes it; She has a pretty light wit too, and she
knowes it; Shee can daunce, and she knowes that too; play at
Shittle-cock, and that too: No quality she has, but she shall
take a very particuler knowledge of, and most Lady-like
commend it to you; you shall haue her at any time read you
the History of her selfe, and very subtilly runne ouer another
Ladies sufficiences to come to her owne.
                  
                     She has a good superficiall iudgement in Painting; and would

of some three beside herselfe.

                  Yes faith; th'other was so neare the common, it had

                  Tis so: by this fanne, I cannot abide any thing that
sauors the poore ouer-worne cut, that has any kindred with it;

                  In good certaine, Madame, it makes you looke most

(Ile assure you) hee's the most dainty, sweet, absolute rare man,

                  There is a Nymph too of a most curious and elaborate

Phantaste—

                  Her very name speakes her; let her passe. But are these
(Cupid) the starres of Cynthias Court? doe these Nymphs attend

                  They are in her Court (Mercury) but not as Starres;
these neuer come in the presence of Cynthia: the Nimphes
that make her traine, are the diuine Arete, Timae, Phronesis,
Thauma, and others of that high sort. These are priuately
brought in by Moria in this licencious time, against her knowledge;
and (like so many Meteors) will vanish when shee
appeares.

whit, you must not sinke vnder the first disaster; It is with your
young Grammattical Courtier, as with your Neophyte-Player,
a thing vsuall to be daunted at the first presence, or enter-view:
you saw, there was Hedon & Anaides, (far more practisd gallants
then your selfe) who were both out, to comfort you: It is no
disgrace, no more, then for your aduenturous Reueller to fall
by some in-auspicious chance in his Galliard, or 
                        •
                     or some subtill

                  Away, thou hast such vnseasonable Iests. By this heauen
I wonder at nothing more then our Gentlemen Vshers;
that will suffer a piece of Serge, or Perpetuana, to come into
the Presence: me thinkes, they, should (out of their Expe

better distinguish the silken disposition of a Courtier,
then to let such terrible course Rags mixe with 'hem, able to
fret any smooth or gentile Society to the threds, with their
rubbing Deuises.

                  Damne me, if I should aduenture on his company
once more, without a sute of Buffe, to defend my wit: he do's
nothing but stabbe the slaue: how mischeiuously he crost thy
deuise of the Prophesie there? And Moria she comes without
her Muffe too; and there my inuention was lost.

                  Well, I am resolu'd, what Ile do.

                  Marry, speake all the venome I can of him; and poyson
his reputation in euery place where I come.

                  At any hand beware of that, so you may draw your

                  Poore pitteous Gallants, what leane idle sleights

                  In credulous eares? it is a Crowne to me,
                  That the best iudgements can report me wrong'd;
                  Them Liars; and their slanders impudent.
                  Perhaps (vpon the rumor of their speeches)
                  Some grieued friend will whisper, Criticus,
                  
                  Men speake ill of thee: So they be ill men,
                  If they spake worse, twere better: For of such
                  To be disprais'd, is the most perfect praise.

                  Both impudent, and ignorant enough;
                  That talke (as they are wont) not as I merit;
                  Traduce by Custome, as most Dogs do barke,
                  Do nothing out of iudgment, but disease;
                  Speake ill, because they neuer could speake well:
                  And who'ld be angry with this race of Creatures?
                  What wise Phisitian haue we euer seene

                  And I do count it a most rare Reuenge,
                  That I can thus (with such a sweet neglect)
                  Pluck from them all the pleasure of their Mallice.

Tis wel enter'd Sir. Stay you come on too fast; your Pace is too

Place where your Lady is pleas'd to be seene: First you present
your selfe thus; and spying her you fall off, and walke some

                     Anaides? you talk't of a tune Philautia, theres one
speakes in a Key: like the opening of some Iustices gate, or a
Post-Boyes horne, as if his voyce fear'd an Arrest for some ill
words it should giue, and were loath to come forth.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  I, and he has a very imperfect face.
               
               
                  Pha.
                  Like a squeez'd Orenge, sower, sower.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  His Hand's too great to; by at least a strawes breadth.
               
               
                  
                  Pha.
                  Nay he has a woorse fault then that too.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  A long heele?
               
               
                  Pha▪
                  
                  That were a fault in a Lady rather then him: No, they
say he puts of the Calues of his legges with his Stockings euery
night.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Out vpon him: turne to another of the Pictures for
Gods sake. What saies Argurion? whom do's she commend afore
the rest?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I hope I haue instructed her sufficiently for an answere.
               
               
                  Mor.
                  Troth I made the motion to her Lady-ship for one to
day i'the Presence, but it appear'd shee was other wayes furnisht
before; She would none.

                  Who was that Argurion?
                  
               
               
                  Mor.
                  Mary the little, poore, plaine Gentlemā i'the black there.
               
               
                  Pha.
                  Who? Criticus?
                  
               
               
                  Arg.
                  I, I, he; A fellow that no body so much as lookt vpon,
or regarded, and she would haue had me done him particuler
grace.
               
               
                  Pha.
                  That was a true trick of your selfe Moria, to perswade
Argurion affect the scholler.
               
               
                  Arg.
                  Tut; but she shalbe no chooser for me. In good faith I
like the Citizens sonne there Asotus, mee thinkes, none of
them all come neare him.
               
               
                  Pha.
                  Not Hedon?
                  
               
               
                  Arg.
                  
                     Hedon, in troth no. Hedon's a pretty slight Courtier▪
and he weares his clothes well, and sometimes in fashion; marry
his face is but indifferent, and he has no such excellent body.
No; th'other is a most delicate youth, a sweete face, a streight
body, a well proportion'd legge, and foote, a white hand, a tender
voyce.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  How now Argurion?
                  
               
               
                  Pha.
                  O you should haue let her alone, she was bestowing a
Coppy of him vpon vs.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Why she doates more palpably vpon him, then ere his
Father did vpon her.
               
               
                  
                  Pha.
                  Beleeue me, the young gentleman deserues it; if she
could doate more t'were not amisse: He is an exceeding proper
youth, and would haue made a most neate Barber-surgeon,
if he had beene put to it in time.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  Say you so? me thinkes▪ he lookes like a Taylor already.

                  I, that had said on one of his Customers suites.

                  Wel Ladyes, Iest on: the best of you both would be glad
of such a seruant.

                  I, Ile be sworne would they: Go to Beauties, make much
of Time, and Place, and Occasion, and Opportunity, and Fauorites,
and things that belong to them; for Ile ensure you, they will all
relinquish; they cannot endure aboue another yeere; I know it
out of future experience, and therefore take exhibition, and
warning: I was once a Reueller my selfe, and though I speake
it (as mine owne Trumpet) I was then esteemd—
               
               
                  Phi.
                  The very Marchpane of the Court I warrant?

                  Saue you sweete and cleare beauties: By the spirit that
mooues in me, you are almost pleasingly bestow'd Ladies.
Only, I can take it for no good Omen, to finde mine Honor so
deiected.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  You need not feare Sir, I did of purpose humble my
selfe against your comming, to decline the pride of my Ambition.
                  
               
               
                  Hed.
                  Fayre Honor, Ambition dares not stoope; but if it be
your sweet pleasure, I shall loose that Title; I will (as I am

                     Hedon) apply my selfe to your bounties.
               
               
                  Phi.
                  That were the next way to distitle my selfe of Honor:
O no, rather be still Ambitious I pray you.
               
               
                  Hed.
                  I will be any thing that you please, whilst it pleaseth

                  Will you haue the Kisse Honor.

                  Ode.
                  
                     O That Ioy so soone should wast!
                  or so sweet a blisse
                  as a Kisse,
                  
                  Might not for euer last!
                  So sugred, so melting, so soft, so delicious,
                  The dew that lyes on Roses,
                  When the Morne her selfe discloses,
                  is not so pretious:
                  O, rather then I would it smother,
                  Were I to taste such another;
                  It should be my wishing
                  That I might dye kissing.
               
               
                  
                  Hedon.
                  I made this Ditty and the Note to it vpon a kisse that
my Honor gaue me; how like you it Sir.
               
               
                  Amor.
                  A pretty Ayre; in generall I like it well. But in particuler,
your long die-Note did arride me most, but it was somwhat
too long: I can shew one, almost of the same nature, but
much before it, and not so long; in a Composition of mine
owne: I thinke I haue both the Note, and Ditty about me.
               
               
                  Hed.
                  Pray you Sir see.
               
               
                  Amor.
                  Yes there is the Note; and all the parts if I mis-thinke
not. I will reade the Ditty to your Beauties here, but first I am
to make you familiar with the occasion, which presents it
selfe thus. Vpon a time, going to take my leaue of the Emperour,
and kisse his great handes; there being then present, the
Kings of Fraunce, and Arragon, the Dukes of Sauoy, Florence,
Orleance, Bourbon, Brunswick, the Lantgrau
                           •
                        , Count Palatine, all
which had seuerally feasted me; besides infinite more of inferiour
persons, as Earles, and others: it was my chance (the Emperour
detain'd by some other affayre) to waite him the fifth
part of an houre, or much nere it▪ In which time (retiring my
selfe into a Bay-window) I encountred the Lady Annabel neice
to the Empresse, and 
                        •
                     ister to the king of Arragon; who (hauing
neuer before ey de me, but onely heard the common report of
my Vertue, Learning, and Trauaile) fell into that extremity of
passion, for my loue, that she there immediatly sounded: Phisitians
were sent for; she had to her chamber; so to her bed; where
(languishing some few daies) after many times calling vpon
me, with my name in her mouth, she expirde. As that (I must
needes say) is the onely fault of my Fortune, that as it hath euer
bin my hap to be sew'd to by all Ladies, and Beauties where
I haue come; so, I neuer yet soiourn'd, or rested in that place,
or part of the world, where some great and admirable faire
Creature died not for my loue.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  O the sweete power of trauaile, are you guilty of this
Cupid?

here present to be sworne.

yet.

                        ; which the Emperour himselfe tooke
care to send after me, in sixe Coaches, couer'd all with black-veluet,
attended by the state of his Empire; all which he freely
gaue me, and I reciprocally (out of the same bounty) gaue it to
the Lords that brought it: onely reseruing, and respecting, the
gift of the deceasde Lady, vpon which I compos'd this Ode,
and set it to my most affected Instrument the Lyra.

the Ditty is affected in euery place? that I do not marry a word
of short quantity, to a long Note▪

Ladiships want embroydered Gownes, Tyres of any Fashion,
Rebatus, Iewels, or Carkanets, any thing what soeuer; if you
vouchsafe to accept.

not construe a peece of Horace at first sighte, he went awaye

hath also drawne these foure faire Virgins from the Pallace of their
Queene Perfection (a word, which makes no sufficient difference,
twixt hers, and thine) to visit thy Imperiall Court: for she their Soueraigne
Lady, not finding where to dwel among men, before her teturne
to heauen: aduised them wholy to consecrate themselues to thy Coelestiall
seruice, as in whose cleare Spirit (the proper Element, and Sphare
of vertues) they should behould not her alone, (their euer honor'd
Mistresse) but themselues) more truely themselues) to liue enthronised.

                      thy fauour
more particularly, but that she knowes no commendation is more auailable
with thee then that of proper vertue: Neuerthelesse, she wilde
them to present this Christall Mound, a note of Monarchy, and
Symbole of Perfection, to thy more worthy Deity; which as heere by
me they most humbly do, so amongst the Rarities thereof, that is the
chiefe, to shew whatsoeuer the world hath excellent, howsoeuer remote
and various. But your irradiate iudgement will soone discouer
the secrets of this little Christall world. Themselues (to appeare
the more plainly) because they know nothing more odious then false
pretexts: haue chosen to expresse their seuerall qualities thus in seuerall
coulors.
                  1 The first in Citron coullour is naturall Affection, which giuen
vs to procure our good, is sometime called Storge, and as euery one is
neerest to himselfe, so this Hand-maid of Reason, allowable Selfe-loue,
as it is without harme, so are none without it: Her place in the Court
of Perfection was to quicken mindes in the pursute of Honor. Her
deuice is a Perpendicular Leuell vpon a▪

word, SE SVO MODVLO: alluding to that true measure
of ones selfe, which as euery one ought to make, so is it most conspicuous
in thy diuine example.
                  2 The second in Greene is Aglaia, delectable and pleasant Conuersation,
whose property it is to mooue a kindly delight, and sometime
not without laughter: Her office to entertaine assemblies, and keepe
societies together with fayre familliarity. Her deuice within a Ring
of clouds, a Heart with shine about it, the worde, CVRARVM

without foulds, without pleights, without coullour, without counterfeit:
and (to speake plainely) Plainenesse it selfe. Her deuice is no Deuice.
The word vnder her siluer Shield: OMNIS ABEST
FVCVS, alluding to thy spotlesse selfe, who art as farre from Impurity,
as from Mortality.
                  My selfe (Coelestiall Goddesse) more fit for the Court of Cynthia,

the more welcome therefore to thy Court, and the fitter to conduct
this Quaternio, who as they are thy professed Votaries, and for that
cause aduersaries to Loue, yet thee (Perpetuall Virgin) they both
loue, and vow to loue eternally.

                  Mer.
                  Sister of Phoebus to whose bright Orbe we owe, that we not
complaine of his Absence; These foure Brethren (for they are Brethrē
and sonnes of Eutaxia, a Lady knowne, and highly belou'd of your
resplendent Deity) not able to be absent, when Cynthia held a solempnity,
officiously insinuate themselues into thy presence: For as there are
foure Cardinall vertues, vpon which the whole Frame of the Cour
                        •
                     
dooth mooue, so are these the foure Cardinall properties without which
the Body of Complement mooueth not. With those foure siluer Iauelins
(which they beare in their hands) they support in Princes Courts the
state of the Presence, as by office they are obliged; which though heere
they may seeme superfluous, yet for Honors sake they thus presume to
visite thee, hauing also bin imployde in the Pallace of Queene Perfection.
And though to them, that would make themselues gratious
to a Goddesse, Sacrifices were fitter then Presents or Impresses, yet
they both hope thy fauor, and (in place of eyther) vse seuerall Symboles
containing the titles of thy imperiall Dignity.
                  1 The hit hermost in the changeable blew, and greene Roabe, is

is the grace of the Presence, and delight of the surueying eye: whom
Ladies vnderstand by the names of Neate, & Elegant. His Symbol
is DIVAE VIRGINI, in which he would expresse thy Deities
principall glory, which hath euer bin Virginity.
                  
                  2 The second in the ritch Acoutrement, and Roabe of Purple
empaled with Gold, is Eupathes; who intertaines his minde with an
harmlesse, but not incurious variety: All the Obiects of his sences are
Sumptuous, himselfe a Gallant, that without excesse can make vse of
superfluities: goe ritchly in Imbroyders, Iewels, (and what not?) without
Vanity; and fare delicately without Gluttony: and therefore (not
without cause) is vniuersally thought to be of fine humor. His Symbole
                     
is DIVAE OPTIMAE. An attribute to expresse thy
Goodnesse in which thou so resemblest loue thy father.
                  3. The third in the blush-collourd Sute is Eutolmos, as duly
respecting others, as neuer neglecting himselfe; commonly knowne by
the title of Good Audacitie, to Courts and courtly assemblies, a guest
most acceptable. His Simbole is DIVAE VIRAGINI, To
expresse thy hardy Courage, in chase of Sauage beasts which harbor
in Woods, and Wildernesse.
                  4. The fourth in Watchet-Tinsell, is the kinde, and truly Benefique
Eucolos. Who imparteth not without respect, but yet without
difficulty: and hath the happinesse to make euery kindnesse seeme double,
by the timely, and freely bestowing thereof, he is the chiefe of them

               SCENA. 5. THE MASQVES Ioyne.
               Cupid, Mercury.
               
                  Cup.
                  Is not that Amorphus the Traueller?
               
               
                  Mer.
                  As though it were not? do you not see how his legges
are in trauaile with a Measure?
               
               
                  Cup.
                  
                     Hedon, thy maister is next.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  What will Cupid turne Nomenclator, and cry them?
               
               
                  Cup.
                  No faith, but I haue a Comedy toward, that would not
be lost for a kingdome.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  In good time, for Cupid will prooue the Comedy.
                  
               
               
                  Cup.
                  
                     Mercury, I am studying how to match them.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  How too mismatch them, were harder.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  It is the Nymphes must do it, I shall sport my selfe with
their passions aboue measure.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Those Nymphes would be tam'd a little indeed, but I
feare thou hast not Arrowes for the purpose.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  O yes, here be of all sorts, Flightes, Rouers, and Butshafts.
But I can wound with a Brandish, and neuer draw Bow
for the matter.
               
               
                  
                  Mer.
                  I cannot but beleeue it my inuisible Archer, and yet
me thinkes you are tedious.
               
               
                  Cup:
                  It behoues me to be somewhat circumspect Mercury,
for if Cynthia here the twange of my Bow, sneele go neare to
whip me with the string; therefore to preuent that, I thus discharge
a Brandish vpon—it makes no matter which of the
couples: Phantaste, and Amorphus at you.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Will the shaking of a shaft, strike'hem into such a Feuer
of Affection?
               
               
                  Cup.
                  As well as the winke of an Eye: but I pray thee hinder
me not with thy prattle.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  
                     Ioue forbid I hinder thee. Marry all that I feare is Cynthias
presence, which with the could of her Chaste

will tarry with the Patient.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  It wiltarry the rather, for the Antiperistasis wil keep it in.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  I long to see the experiment.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Why their marrow boyles already, or they are all turnd
Eunuchs.
                  
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Nay and't be so, Ile giue ouerspeaking, & be a Spectator
onely.
               
               They daunce the 1. Strains.
               
                  Amor.
                  
                     Cynthia (by my bright soule) is a right exquisite, and
spendidious Lady; yet Amorphus I thinke hath seene more fashions,
I am sure more Countries; but whether I haue or no:
what need we gaze on Cynthia, that haue our selfe to admire?
               
               
                  Phan.
                  O excellent Cynthia; yet if Phantaste sat where shee
do's, and had such a tyre on her head (for attire can do much) I
say no more; but Goddesses are Goddesses, and Phantaste is as she
is. I would the R

all this Ruffling.
               
               
                  Mer.
                  How now Cupid? heer's a wonderfull change with
your Brandish? do you not heare, how they doate?
               
               
                  Cup.
                  What Prodigie is this? no Word of Loue? no Mention?
no Motion?
               
               
                  Mer.

                  Are my Darts enchanted? is their vigor gone? is their
vertue—
               
               
                  Mer.
                  What? Cupid turn'd iealous of himselfe? ha, ha, ha.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Laughes Mercury?
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Is Cupid angry?
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Hath he not cause, when his purpose is so deluded?
               
               
                  Mer.
                  A rare Comedy, it shall be intitled; Cupids.
                  
               
               
                  Cup.
                  Doe not scorne vs Hermes.
                  
               
               
                  Mer.
                  Chollar and Cupid are two fiery things; I scorne 'hem
not. But I see that come to passe which I presag'd in the beginning.
               
               
                  Cup.
                  You cannot tell: perhaps the Phisicke will not worke
so soone vpon some, as vpon others. It may be the Rest are not
so resty.
               
               
                  Mer.

remainder.

                  Ile trye: this is the same Shafte with which I wounded
Argurion.
                  
               
               
                  Mer.
                  I, but let me saue you a labour Cupid: there were certaine
Bottles of Water fetcht, and drunke off, (since that time,)
by these Gallants.
               
               
                  Cup.

for him?

Phronesis Tim E, and others there?

                              From Belying Ladyes fauors, Noble-mens countenance,
coyning counterfet Imployments, vain-glorious taking
to them other mens Seruices, and all selfe-louing Humors.

                  NOw each one dry his weeping Eyes,
                  and to the Well of Knowledge hast;
                  Where purged of your Maladies,
                  we may of sweeter waters taste:
                  And with refined voice report,
                  The Grace of Cynthia, and her Court.

            Epilogus▪
            
            GEntles, be't knowne to you, since I went in
            I am turn'd Rimer; and do thus beginne:
            The Author (iealous, how your sence doth take
            His trauayles) hath enioyned me to make
            Some short, and Ceremonious Epilogue;
            
            But if I yet know what, I am a Rogue:
            He ties me to such Lawes, as quite distract
            My thoughts; and would a Yeare of time exact.
            I neither must be Faint, Remisse, nor Sory,
            Sower, Serious, Confident, nor Peremptory:
            But betwixt these. Lets see? to lay the blame
            Vpon the Childrens Action, that were lame.
            To craue your Fauours with a begging knee,
            Were to distrust the Writers faculty;
            To promise better at the next we bring,
            Prorogues disgrace, commends not any thing.
            Stifly to stand on this, and proudly approoue
            The Play, might taxe the Maker of Selfe-loue.
            Ile onely speake, what I haue heard him say;
            By God 'tis good, and if you lik't, you may,
            FINIS.
            
               
                  Ecce rubet quidam, pallet, stupet, oscitat, odit.
                  Hoc volo: nunc nobis carmina nostra placent.
