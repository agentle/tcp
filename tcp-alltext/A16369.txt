            SAthanas king of sorow / prince of darckenes and lord of Hel / Abbot of apostasie, of the order of ypocresie / prouost of pride / & prouincial generall of all mischiefe. Unto oure true subiectes of the order of al couentes of liars, we doo sende our greting with as good welfare as we haue our selues: desiring & charging you vpon your allegāce that ye at al times be readie & obedient vnto this our will and commaundemēt. Iesu Christ that miserable person, the sonne of Mari hath deceiued vs. For in time of his liuing vpon the earthe, he fained in al thinges, vsing himself so sottellie & craftelie, that we might not know surelie what he was, he liued in great pouertye and wretchednesse withoute anie worldlie lordeshippes. Yf anye were

ryche and wise, he made them wret ches, beggers, and starke fooles to al mens iudgement, 
                  〈◊〉
                them to liue onely in charitye and 
                  〈◊〉
               , to despise the world, and to refuse the vanities therof. So that he & his simple fooles taught the priestes and clerkes that 
                  〈◊〉
                be theyr successours and Christes disciples / 
                  〈◊〉
                so to liue. And vnto them he left certeyn foolyshe writinges called the Pistels and Gospels, wherein they shoulde alwaies know their maisters simple liuing, and how to lyue thereafter them selues. Thys wretched and simple Christ was not onely contēt to lyue thus peuishly himselfe, but he reproued the lordes, Byshops, high princes & priestes our chaplains of honour, and al the scribes and phareses, the executors of our daylye seruice (because they were

contrarye to hys lyuynge and teachynge) and the true fulfyllers of our high commaundements: they that wer altogether giuen (as our eternall wyll was) to couetousnes and lordshippes. They had religious Abbotes, holy orders, perfect commaundemēts of the law, with all other thinges that becommeth our seruauntes to haue. Whyche thinges semed very holy and without deceit vnto the eyes of the vnlearned people. Therfore this cursed Christ, reproued opēly our hie Lordes and great clarkes. In so much that bothe we aud they were in daunger and feare of losing the mighty kyngdome of thys worlde whiche we haue in peaceable possession. And doutlesse yf we hadde not (by our excellent learnyng) inuented and found a short remedie: we had clearly bene vndone. But

wee and oure faythfull Lordes, Preestes, Clerkes, Scribes and Pharases withall oure myghtye parsons of our kingdome, founde a meanes by our wisedom, might and power, to put him to 
                  〈◊〉
                after such a fassion and by the auctoritie of the law: that no man could finde faute in his condempnacion, but euerie man iudged him warthie of death, sauing a 
                  〈◊〉
                foolish vagaboundes that had no dwelling place / whō also he had deceiued with his false doctrine. So that we thought our selfe / and all ours to be out of daūger for euer. But now that we knew not him to be God / he hath deceiued vs, and set vs in woorse case then euer we were before, through the might of his Godhead. For he arose from death to life the thirde daye / and shewed him self to his Disciples.

Of this our soldiours which kept the sepulchre were witnes, he dyd also teach & preache the kingdome of heauen to his frendes which is contrary to our eternal lordships. And after. 
                  〈◊〉
               . daies he ascēded vp into heauen / commaunding his apostles to preache his gospel to euery creature thorow oute all the world. And ten daies after he sent them his holy spirite whiche both taught them all veritie / and also strengthned and boldned them, so that they nether feared vs nor our mighty power (though we put thē to death) but went forth boldlie & preached his gospell vnto al men. So that they withdrewe from our mighti lordships more people thē euer their wretched maister christ did. In so much that the hie wai & clergie of our mightie kingdome was ouergrowen and worē cleare

out of knnwledge, where thorowe we & our most eternall Lordshyps were almost destroyed. Wherfore we perceauinge thys (by our eternal wysdome) and many other ieopardies that might haue fallen to our excellent parsone / ordeyned a general counsel of al Dukes, princes / barons, cōmens, wyth the cursed company of our religions and lordships of hel, to set a redresse in al thinges. And so by our sage and wyse counsell it was deuised that euery mischiefe must be destroyed by his contrary. And where as the mischiefe and destruccion of oure kyngdome came by pouerty, mekenes, and despising of Lordshippes (whiche al priestes had learned of Christ and his disciples) therefore oure highnes thoughte wyth oure wyse counsaile that oure religion and true seruice muste be recouered

againe with riches of priestes, by mightye power, by sottell learnyng / and by al worldlye honour For this our highnes hath deuised and 
                  〈◊〉
                that priestes of al de grees mighte be of a great multitude to haue 
                  〈◊〉
                without nomber, to haue also all maner of rule and worldly 
                  〈◊〉
               , and so great power ouer euery man, that no mā might ouerface them. But to rule Lordes and Kynges and all the world at their pleasure. And thus to come with more diligence to our seruice and Lordships: & to bring this our high counsel the better to passe: we moued the Emperour in Pope 
                  〈◊〉
                hys daies by our 
                  〈◊〉
                and prinye meanes to geue and 
                  〈◊〉
                Priests & clarkes with al worldly lordships which was cō trary to ye doctrine of our wretched 
                  〈◊〉
                Christ. And for because we

would not that it should be perceiued: we deuised this to bee geuen vnder ye colour of an almes. For Siluester was a litle scrupulous and if we had not diligentlie entised him vnder this colour of almes, hee woulde haue forsaken it. We also perswaded him to bestow it on holie Churche, and so thorowe our hie wisdome we brought to passe that he tooke these worldlye Lordshippes: and all his successours haue folowed hys steps and in that thinge succeded him most fastest, so that now they haue gathered so plenteously that they are lordes and kinges of the arth, and are become our true and faithful chaplaines of honour. And thē not long after we deuised for them certaine priuilegies that they and al theirs shuld be exempte from al due obedience and from vnder the

correction of anie good lawe. But that al other men shuld be rather vnto them. Also because we could not be serued in poore & litle churches, we deuysed large monastaries, proude saying & piping with out hart. So that we made thē honour our enemy christe with their lyps, and honoured vs with their harts, we also haue ordained that nothing shuld be mynistred in our temples without mony wherwith they might haue welfare of bodye with delicate meates and drinkes & gorgious apparel in the sight of the world, & great places to maintaine their lordships in: & because we wold not be proued cōtrarie to Christ, we deuised yt no man shuld cal ani of his goods seueral or pro per to his own vse, saiīg it is mine but rather to saye in general / it is ours / or the patrimoni of s. Augustine,

Dominike / Fran̄ces / or some other such saint. And because that men would thinke that we had deuised these thinges of our own power, we by our eternall wisdō haue ordeyned also that you our trustye 
                  〈◊〉
                of al the orders of lyers shuld come in to beare witnes that 
                  〈◊〉
                these things are lawful & good, and that ye mighte be more in estimatiō in the eyes of the simple peo ple, we deuised that ye shuld come withal ypocresy and dissimulacion of liuing, simple of raiment, loking rufully, speaking holyly, croking & ducking lowly vnto euery man: no thing sayinge that ye haue, but all thing willing to haue / making lōg prayers for money. We haue gyuen you a title of beggyng of euerye man / and you to giue no man whereby you maye encrease in ryches and Iyue easely. And to hyde

all thynges from the syghte of the people 
                  〈◊〉
                haue geuen you large Monastaries to take your pleasure in. In the whych solitary places / vnder the colour of chastitye, ye may 
                  〈◊〉

                  〈◊〉
                zodomitre. We haue also deuised that you should go to scoole vnder the pretence of godlye preachyng / whereby you may come into more fauour and power to encrease our seruice. 
                  〈◊〉
                to bring you to world ly honoure we haue ordeyned that you shall take all the degrees of scole, that men maye geue you the more: and by this meanes you may com to worldly lordships and wel fare, which at your beginning you 
                  〈◊〉
                vtterly to refuse. Wherfore we perceauing your faythfull and 
                  〈◊〉
                seruice that you beare toward vs (in fulfyllyng of oure hye ordynaunce,

and mainteining of our noble kingdome) haue written vnto you a letter of the ordinaunce and statutes of our most increable 
                  〈◊〉
                cel, confirming you how thei shalbe continued & how our lordships shall be best encreased. Firste wee wyl you to keepe no pouertye nor meekenes in harte, but in countenaunce onely consider how we except you aboue al mē, you must al so haue meeke wordes, and proud dedes, charitable outwardes, and enuious inwards, and se that you encrease in riches & hate beggers, professe it in wordes, but 
                  〈◊〉
                in deedes. And that you maye bring al these thinges to passe and allother the better about: we haue deuised you to be confessours to lordes and ladies to the intent that ye mai the more depely inspire thē with the doctrine of your God our

Pope whō in aniwise forget not to affirme to be Gods holye Uikar: which as you know well is ye head Antechrist our faithful successour We haue geuen you al fained and worldly power to preach for mony alledging alwaies great necessiti: therfore doo thus muche for vs againe, that ye preach nothing that shal displease ani great mē, but ra ther yt which shall most delite thē & their appetites: for those be they which may soone depose both you and vs if ye once displease them: & that our mortal enemies those beg gerly wretches of our aduersarye Christ do once with his peuish gos pel vtter vnto thē your falshed & ypocrisy, & so preuaile among thē. Se that you learne your yong noueses your precepts diligētly.

                rich mē, for so shal you mayntaine

our true seruice. If ani folish wret ches wil teach the gospel of our enemy Christ. See that you stande stifly in our name against thē, crying and saying: theyr maner of tea ching is 
                  〈◊〉
                doctrine, and heresy, and cōtrarie to al that the fathers of our holy Churche taught. And see that ye be diligent to accuse thē to the heade Lordes and gouernoues, for the destruction of the worldly honour and riches of our carnal 
                  〈◊〉
                / and that vnder the colour of the 
                  〈◊〉
                of the holy Churche. 
                  〈◊〉
                if anye mightye Prince doo manfullye mayntayne our worldly regiment. Se that ye crowne him with 
                  〈◊〉
                vayne glorye of our famous title or other, and make hym beleue that it is more woorth to him, and that he hathe a greater treasure of it, then of many thousand poundes. But if they

once smell to warde the gospel of our mortall enemy christe, whether it be by the reading of some of his eluishe bokes, or els moued to pytye thorow the pacyent sufferinge of death of his disciples whereby they then begin to suspecte youre falsehed. Then run vnto the great bishops our true messengers, and cause them to turne the rulers mindes some other way by geuyng thē money or corruptinge them wyth some gay promises or great giftes And we on our part wil do such diligence that againste you come to the bishops our ministers, we will moue the matter afore hande telling them that if your ypocresye be once open, their pride and pompe cannot long be hid. Se that amōg you with the helpe of our byshops without faile against al tempestes and stormes that may happen vnto

out kingdom: ye set vp or cause to be set vp of the temporal sorte, of suche as haue the moste subtyl and practised wittes and wyll bee corrupted with money at the least 
                  〈◊〉
               . or. iii. proctours, for two causes The one because the blynde laye people shal think that mē of smal learning are 
                  〈◊〉
                inough to cō founde such 
                  〈◊〉
                opinions: and as thoughe ye your selues coulde do greater things. Another cause is thys that yf oure kyngedome chaunce to catch a fal in any region, you may yet say that you prea ched not so, but the temporal men write so, and so leaue your proctours in the dich and escape quite your selues. Also if any crafty per swasion of worldlye wysedome or subtil sophistry by our secret insti gacion do come vnto any of your

mindes, that looke you wryte alwayes and sende it, to youre proctoures. Be it prouided alwayes amonge you that if you chose but two proctoures, let the one in any wise be muche younger then the other, that he maye whan the olde is blind and wery, helpe forth with those thynges that the other for age or blyndes coulde not finyshe and so maye oure churche be well defended. And then go to and be of good comforte, and take to you a lustye courage, make a good face, bable, lye, and crye out apase: sayinge that al maketh on youre syde Chryste, his holye apostles and al the olde holye doctoures wyth the vse of the holye churche this fyftene hundred yeares. Yf the people wold haue

But let your temporal proctour do it, to bleare the eyes of the commons withal, & make them beleue that he wyl be indifferent: yea or rather if it com so best to passe, you may do it your selues in the name of some proud boye, and for his labour cal him a yong gentilman, whom you maye fayne to haue alledged againste those heretikes as manye stronge reasons as you your selues could ymagine: and lette those youre Proctoures neuer goo playnelye foorthe / too the proofe of anye thynge / nor dyspute the matter /
