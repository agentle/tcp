                  •…
               ys priuye Counsell, Thomas Leauer wysheth increase of Grace and godly honoure.
            
               MErcy, grace, and peace from God the father almyghty, vnto your honours, wyth my moste humble and reuerente comendacions.
            The enemye of God and man alwayes se kyng lyke a rorynge lion whome he may deuoure, is much at al tymes, but then especially to betaken hede vnto, when as he hym self beyng transformed into the aungell of lyght, doth cloke the ministers of hys myschiefe in a pretensed shew of godlines and vertue, so that ther by they be suffered of al men, and maynteined of many men, to worcke and brynge vnto passe a deuilli she dysorder, and shamefull dyshonestye in a Christen commen wealth.
            Wherefore, seynge that in thys realme

preachers, officers, marchauntes, crafts mē, labourers, and such lyke, be displaced of their roumes, and dysapoynted of theyr lyuinges by those whych through a pretensed name, & outward apperance, seme to be necessary and profytable ministers in a common wealthe, (how beit in theyr owne doynges may be euidently tryed and knowen for to be sp
                  •…
               ylers and disturbers of any common welth) suredly you of the kynges most honourable counsell, beyng the chefe maiestrats and rulers in this realme, had nede to be ware, circumspect and diligent, lest that Sathan banyshyng al faithful Christians, whych should and wold prouyde to helpe one an other, do fyl this realme ful of crafty flatterers, whych can and wyll deceyue, begyle, and spoyle one another.
            Truly ther be no men more against Christ then those which by profession of Christen relygyon, and bearyng of a Christen name, doo rob Christ of hys honor, & Christes ministers of theyr liuyngs: nor none more parilous ennemies vnto the kings maiesty, and vnto this realme, thē those whyche haue the names of Englishmen, and the kyngs subiects wyth y• condicions & maners of enemies, & traitors.
            Most gracious good lordes and maisters, for your reuerent loue towardes God, and

the kyng, for your charitable pytye of myserable spoiled people, and for the necessary regarde of your owne honours, and the state of thys realme, se and consyder how that ambicious couetous men, do bye and sel, take and abuse personages, prebendes, offyces, fees, marchaundyse, fermes, landes, and goodes, so that prowlyng for them selues, they be neither afrayde, nor ashamed to spoile thys realme of preachyng of Gods gospel, of iustyce and equitie, of cheape and plenty, and of euery thynge that should saue, kepe, or profytte a commune wealthe.
            Wherfore most gracious good lordes, and maysters, for the tender mercies of God in our Sauiour Iesus Christ, take hede that neyther seruaunte, nor frende, reteyner, nor youreselues do deceyue you wyth flatterye.
            For seynge that ambicious couetous men do take, kepe, and enioye the roumes and lyuynges of euerye mannes vocacion, bothe you and we be in farre more daunger, then yf blockehouses and bulwarkes made and kepte of the kynges faythful subiectes for the sauegarde of thys realme, were taken and abused of suche Scottes or Frenchemen, as makyng spoyle for theyr owne profit, would not spare to dystroye thys realme.
            
               
There is very manye rowmes and lyuynges, belongynge both vnto the ecclesia stical mynisterye, and also vnto cyuyll policye, in the whyche be no fayethful subiectes, godlye diligente ministers and offycers, whi che by doynge of theyr duties, doo saue, kepe and comforte the people: but couetous Idolatours, whych neglectyng theyr dutye

                if there be any men that goo aboute to perswade the Kynges Magestye, or you of hys honourable Councell, that thinges in thys realme for the mostparte be honourablye, godlye, or charytably reformed, they be but flaterers.
            For papistry is not banyshed out of Englande by pure religion, but ouerrunne, suppressed and kepte vnder within thys realme by couetous ambicion. Papistrye abused ma ny thyngs, couetousnes hath distroyed more: papistry is supersticion, couetousnes is Idolatry. Papistrye afore tyme dyd obscure the Kinges honour, and abuse the wealth of this realme, couetousnes at thys tyme doth more abuse and decaye theym bothe, makynge the kynge bare, the people poore, and the realme miserable.

was deuyded amongest wycked soldyers, which dyd cruelly torment a righteous persō.
            Alas most gracious reuerente Lordes and maysters, if ye vse the seruyse, or hear the aduyse of false crafty flatterers, ye shall therewyth be so blynded that ye can neyther perceyue by your selues, nor beleue when as ye be playnely and faythfully tolde, that manye of your owne doynges, commyng of mans freyltye, do tend muche vnto the displeasure of God, dyshonour of the kynge, and dyscredyt of your selues, beyng moste contrarye to that reuerent zele and faythful loue towards God, the kyng, and the cōmen wealth, which zeleand loue god of hys goodnes hath graffed in your hartes, and the deuyll by mannes freyl dedes couered in sylence or colored with prayse of flatterers, laboreth to deface, peruert and destroye.
            As God whyche searcheth the secretes of mans hart, doth beare me recorde, I do suppose, and thynke that you dooe so louyng lye drede God, reuerence the kyng, and regarde this realme, & your owne honors, that beyng charged wyth the ouersight and prouision of castels, holdes, and fortes, made and kept for the safegarde of thys realme, ye coulde not wyttyngly be hyred to sell one of them vnto

the kynges ennemyes, for al the treasures in the world. And yet beyng craftelye deceyued wyth 
                  •…
               attery, ye vse a daungerous practyse in very many of them.
            Forther be some of them sclenderly assauted at certayne tymes of feble enemyes: and other continuallye beseged eyther wyth open forse or craftye conueyaunce of fearce, cruel, and perylous enemies. And now crafty flatterers whych haue once serued for theyr wages in tyme and place of the sclender assalte, doo afterwardes requyre and perswade you for that seruyse to geue them the spoyle of other holdes remayning continuallye in more daunger Truly Frenchmen and Scottes be but feble ennemyes, and at certayne tymes do sclenderly assalt castels, towers, and such maner of holdes: The deuyl seking lyke a ro ryng Lyon, whom he may deuoure, nyghte & day, wynter and sommer, wyth a wonderful forse of wycked spirites, doth euer besyege by shopryckes, shyres, townes, and parishes.
            Yf these places be not wel furnished with stout and true soldiers of bothe the sortes (I meane both officers in ciuyle polycy, and also Prelates in Ecclesiasticall ministery) or if those souldyers be vnprouided of necessary liuyngs and dewe wages, then must the people

nedes peryshe and be destroyed for theyr owne synnes, and the bloud of theyr bodyes and soules requyred at your handes, whyche be charged and trusted of both God, and the king to prouide souldiers to those places, and also wages and liuinges to mayntayne those soldyers continually.
            How be it now manye personages, benefyces, offyces, and fees be sold vnto couetous brybers for money, whych seke nothyng but the vantage of extorcion, robbry and spoyle, and fewe of them be freely giuen vnto faithful ministers & officers for their woorthynes, whych could and would by diligent doynge of their dutie, gouerne, instruct and cheryshe goddes people, the kynges subiectes.
            And therefore nowe the most part of men lackyng teachers & rulers, do without griefe of conscience, or feare of punishment, abuse euery thynge vnto the ruine and destruccion, whyche God hath ordayned vnto the vpholdyng & increase of a christiā commune welth.
            As for example, now bying and sellyng is not vsed as a prouision for good cheape and great plenty, but made the most occasyon of dearth and scarsitie. Wealth and wyt be not ryghtly vsed vnto a common confortable pro fyt, but shamefully abused vnto a wycked pri

uate gayne. Many offyces with authoritie be not duely disposed vnto faithful worthy men nor to dooe good vnto other, but vnlawfullye bought and solde amongest couetous, ambicious men, to get gaynes vnto theim selues. So this realme is spoyled, the kynge is made bare, & his faithful true subiectes be many of thē very poore: but crafti deceiuers, couetous Extorcioners, brybynge offycers, and suche false flatterers be wonderous rich & welthy.
            These Flatterers be wonders perilous felowes, hauynge two faces vnder one hoode. For they beare a face and shew towardes the people, as though by Commyssion and commaundement from you, there must bee more required and taken of the people th

The father draweth not by force violētlye them that be stuborne and frowarde, but by loue thē that be gē tyll, & come wyllyngly▪ For when the father sheweth in Chryste forgeuenes of synnes, grace of amendement▪ iustificacion, and euerlastyng lyfe, thē those that make fast theim selues wyth the bande of loue by desyre of the same be drawen vnto Chryst.
            As contrary wyse when the deuyll sheweth in fleshlye lustes and worldly vanytyes, manye voluptuous pleasures, then they that there wyth be entangled and delyted be drawen of the temptour away from Chryst. Take hede therfore how ye haue entred into religion, professed chryste▪ and receyued the gospell. For if ye be

drawen by loue of mercy, grace and 
                  •…
               yghteousnes, ye come vnto Chryst: But by the desyre of ryches, welth, & voluptuousnes, men be drawen and 
                  •…
               ysed away from Christe.
            He therfore that by the profession of Christ, the zele of hys worde, the fauoure of the gospell, seeketh couetous gayne, or a carnal liberty, surely he is a seruaunt of Mammon, ennemy vnto Christe, and a sclaunde
               
                  •…
               er of the gospel. For he that wyll be the seruaunt of Christe, must folow the example of Christ. He that wyll folowe Christ in example of lyuyng, he muste forsake hymselfe, take hys crosse vpō hys backe dayly & folow Christ. So Christes seruaūt shalbe deliuered frō the bondage of synne, y• he maye frely & wyllyngly contemnyng y• vanities of the world, & mortifying y• lusts of y• flesh, serue chryst in bearyng the crosse of paynful diligēce, to do the duty of his vocacion.
            
               
But all those that delyte in a carnall libertye, or seeke vnlawfull geynes, althoughe they be named Chrystians and fauourers of the gospell, yet be they in dede not mynisters of Christ, but ennemyes vnto Christe: not louers of the Gospell b

                sclaunderers of the Gospell, not iustyfied by liuelye faythe to be of that ryghteouse sorte for whose sakes GOD spareth and fauoureth a common wealthe, but deceyued wyth a dead fayth to be of that vngodlye sorte, for whose cause God plageth and destroyeth many a common welth. And nowe vndoutedly be we in greate miseries and daunger of destruccion, for that we haue many that be hearers, readers, and talkers of Gods worde, and fewe or none that do walke and lyue accordyng to gods worde: we ought truly to esteme and take theym onlye to be mynysters of Christe whyche for

the loue of mercy, grace, and ryghtuousnes shewed of the father vnto theim in Christ, do kyll the lustes of theyr owne fleshe, dyspyse the vanytyes of the whole worlde, and forsakyng theyr own pleasures and commodities do take the crosse of paynfull diligence and walke after Christ in doynge of theyr dutyes.

Nowe let vs after thys takynge of the mynisterye of Chryste, wyich perteineth generally vnto all christians, speake of the dysposers of Gods mysteryes, wherin we maye cōsider seuerally euery mās vocaciō.
            Paule dyd dyspose the secretes of God by the preachynge of the Gospell, whych was euer secretly hydde from the wyttye, wyse, and learned in the worlde. Other men in other vocacions must dyspose other treasures of God by other meanes. As the magistrate by authorytye muste dyspose the punyshmente of vyce, & the mayntenaunce of vertue.
            The rych man by liberalytye, must dyspose reliefe and comforte vnto the poore and nedye. The Marchaunt

The landelorde by lettyng of fermes must dyspose vnto the tenants necessary lands, and houses of an indifferent rente. The houshandmē by tyllyng of the groūd and kepyng of cattel, must dyspose vnto theyr landlordes, dew rentes, and vnto them selues & other, both corne, and other vytals. So euerye man by doynge of hys dutye muste dyspose vnto other that commodytye and benefyte, whiche is cōmitted of god vnto theym to be dysposed vn to other, by the faythful and diligent doyng of theyr du

               yes.
            The treasures of the Lord be vnmesurable, his hart is lyberall, ther can be therefore no lacke amonges hys people, yf hys stewards vnto whom the dysposing of hys gyftes be committed,

be true and faythfull. Thys therfore saythe Paule, is requyred in a steward, y• he be faythfull. Who thynk▪ ye, sayth Christ, is a faythefull and a wyse stewa

Beholde the faythfulnes of the Lordes steward consysteth in dylygente prouydynge and mynistrynge vnto the Lordes famylye anye suche thynges as bee necessary. The reward of such faythfulnes is to be put in trust wyth all that his Lord & master hath. Then who can delyre a better master then the Lorde God or a hygher roume then a stewardshyppe in the house of Christ, or a greater reward then to

But these haue euerye mannes lyuyng, & doo no mans duytye. For they haue that whyche is in dede the lyuynge of craftes men, Marchauntmenne, husbandmen, landelordes and tennauntes, and do neuer a one of these mens dutyes. These be ydle vacaboundes,

lyuyng vpon other mens labours: these be named honest barginers, and be in dede craftye couetouse extorcioners. For they that be true marchauntemen to by and sell in dede, shoulde and doo prouyde great plentye and good chepe by honest byenge and sellynge of theyr wares. But these hauynge the names of true marchauntes, and beyng in dede crafty theues, do make a scarsitye and dearth of all thynges that cōmeth through theyr handes.
            Take awaye all marchauntmen from anye towne or cytye, and ye shall leaue almost no prouysyon of thinges that be necessarye. Take awaye leasmongers, régrators and all suche as by byinge and sellynge make thyngs more dere, & when they be gone, all thyngs wylbe more plen tye and better chepe. Now maye ye se who they be that make a greate

dearth in a great plentye. For who is it, that heygtheneth the pryce of Corne, the housbandman that getteth plentye of corne by tyllynge of the grounde? No: the regrator that byeth corne to make it dere, growynge vpon the grownde. Who reyseth rentes, ioyneth house to house, and heapeth fermes together?

reason, consyder the decaye of thys Realme, and the towardnes of the kynges magestye. Note the decaye of thys realme, and thereby ye shall learne to knowe that nothynge can make a realme wealthye, yf the inhabitauntes thereof be couetouse: for yf landes and goodes coulde haue made a realme happy notwyth standynge mennes couetousnes, then shoulde not thys realme soo vnhappylye haue decayed, when as by the suppressiō of Abbeies, Colleges and Chaunteries, innumerable lāds and goodes were gotten.
            If goddes worde were ordeyned by anye other meane then by the conuertynge of couetous men, to make that realme happy where couetous men be, then suerlye shoulde England now be most happy, wher gods word is frely set forth in the mother toung, playnly preached in solēpne

congregacions, and cōmonly vsed in daily cōmunicacion. But vndoubtedlye whereas couetouse men be, there neyther landes or goodes, no not goddes holye Gospell canne doo so muche good as couetousnes doeth harme. Wherefore seyng thys realm by couetousnesse is soore decayed, least it shoulde also by the same be destroyed, awaye wyth youre couetousnes, all you y• loue thys realme. Or yf ye wyll not do it for loue of the realme, yet for the reuerente obedience whyche ye owe vnto God and the kynges maiestie, away wyth couetousnes whyche maketh men seruauntes of Mammon, and enemyes vnto god and the kynge. Be ye well assured that the kynges Maiestye whyche nowe is, God saue his noble grace, dreadeth god, loueth his people, & abhorreth couetousnes, whiche in this realme offendeth God, dishonoureth

y• kyng, anoyeth the people.
            Therefore he doeth partly nowe perceyue and consider, and wyll do better hereafter, that prelates wyth pluralities, and magystrates wyth manie offices, do burden him and his people wyth paying tithes, fees, and manye greate charges, and yet kepe so many roumes vacant of prechers and officers, that his magesty cannot be duly serued, nor his people well instructed by the preachyng of gods word, nor yet well ordred by the mynistracion of iustice and equitye.
            He knoweth that regratours of corne vyttals and of all manner of wares, make suche dearthe and scarcitie, that no diligence of good marchauntes by honest byinge and sellynge canne prouyde anye thynges to be eyther good cheap or plentiful. It is well knowen to his gracious maiesty, or at the least vnto hys honourable

councell that leasemūgers takynge muche of tenauntes and paying lyttell vnto the landlordes, haue both theyr lyuynges, and doth the dutyes of neyther. For to theyr owne pryuate luker they take rentes of tenauntes, and fermes of land lordes: but when by occasyon they shall be requyred to serue the Kynge for a common wealth, then they wyll haue neyther landes nor

Do not therfore imagyn you that be eyther of the cler gye or of the laytye in hyghe or lowe degree, that the Kynges Gracious Magestie and his honourable councell be so negligent that they do not espye, or so parcyall that they wyll not punyshe those whyche in thys realme hynder the prechyng of gods word, stoppe the adminystracion of iustice and equitye, cause of all thynges a dearthe and scarsytye, and

brynge Gentlemenne too poouertye, and husbandmen vnto beggerye. It is spyed and muste be punyshed, although it be delayed for a tyme, to se yf you of your selues wyllynglye wyll amende it.
            Beware therefore that ye staye not your selfe vnto a bryttell staffe, for it wyll brast in spylles and perce thorowe your▪ handes. Do not stay your selfe vpon thys ymaginacion to thynke that althoughe craftelye contrary to lawe and conscience ye do inuade other mennes roumes, liuynges and goodes, yet for because ye be so many in number that do it, therefore the kynge and hys councell eyther cannot or wyll not bee agaynste you in it: For trulye euen therefore muste they nowe neades wythout delaye reforme and amend it.

And then prayse shall be vnto euery one of God, that geueth prayse to the prayse worthy. If Paule, beynge a mynyster of Christe, and a disposer of Goddes mysteryes, was so faythefull in hys doynge that neyther all the worlde nor hys owne conscience coulde in any thyng reproue hym, and yet to contynue hys carefull dylygence had euermore a great respecte vnto the commyng and iudgement of the Lorde: Howe shall we thynke that they rede and take thys place, whiche beyng knowen both to theym selues and vnto the whole worlde to do very euyl in many thyngs, yet wythout care of amendement, do forget theym selues, the Lord, and his iudgemēte?

Surely they vnderstand it as Peter sayth: that many places of Paul be vnderstand of them whych beyng indocti 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                vnlearned and vnsetled in iudgement, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                wrast or wryng vntyll a wrong pin in suam ipsorum perniciem, vnto theyr owne destruccyon, manye places of Paule, et reliquas scripturas, and the other scriptures. For whereas thys place of Paul should be applyed to make men carefull and diligent, they wrast and wryng it to make for them that be careles and negligent. For Paul sayth that he doth very lytle regarde what any man doth iudge of hym, menyng therby that though all the world wolde commende hym, yet wold he not be vayne glorious, of hys well doynge. They saye, they passe lytle what any man saythe by them, meanyng therby that though all men fynde fautes wyth theim, yet

wyll they neuer be ashamed of their euyll doynge. Paule sayeth that no man shoulde iudge, meanynge that no man as concernynge secretes of the mynde, should iudge other to be yuell, and theim selfes to be iust: and so take occasion to speake shamefully of other, and to glory in theim selues: they saye that no man shoulde iudge, meanynge that neyther preacher nor friende▪ shoulde so rebuke theyr manifest euyll dedes, as myght geue theym occasion to be ashamed of theym selues, and leue iudgynge of other. Lette vs not wrest the places of Paule and of other scripturs vnto a wrong purpose. They wrest the saying of Paule vnto a wrong meanynge, when as the mercye of God, whyche passeth all hys works is denyed of theym vnto anye penytente synnet, by theyr allegynge of the tenth of Paull vnto the Ebrues.

Then is that place not well applied but wronge wrested. For when it is sayde that yf we synne wylfullye after that we haue receiued the knowe ledge of the trueth, there remayneth no more sacrifice for synne, but a fearefull lookynge for iudgemente and violente fyer, it is a meante that there is remaynynge and leafte in the scriptures no mencyon of sacrifyce for the forgeuenesse of synnes, but terrible threatnynges of vengeaunce to punyshe synners, too bee preached vnto wylfull synners.
            Howbeit there is no condemnacion but alwayes mercye to be preached vnto theym that grafted in Christe Iesu, be penitent synners, how sore & ofte soeuer they fall▪ For his mercy is aboue all hys workes. Therefore whensoeuer he suff
