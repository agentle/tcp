            THE PRINTER TO THE READER.
            
               DOest-thou seeke after the Author? It is in vaine; for hee is harder to be found then the parents of Popes were in the old times: yet if thou haue an itch of gessing, receiue from me so much, as a friend of his, to whom he sent his booke to bee read, writ to me. The Author was vnwilling to haue this booke published, thinking it vnfit both for the matter,

which in it selfe is weighty and serious, and for that grauity which himselfe had proposed and obser ued in an other booke formerly published, to descend to this kinde of writing. But I on the other side, mustred my forces against him, and produced reasons and examples. I proposed to him the great Erasmus (whom though In Con

our Church is as much beholden, as to Luther himselfe, who fought so valiantly in the maine battell. I remembred him also how familiar a fashion this was amongst the Papists themselues; and how much Rebullus that Run-away, had done in this kinde, as well in those bookes, which he cals Salmonees, as in his other, which he entitles, The Cabal of the Reformed Churches, of which booke, if he were not the Author, hee was certainly the Apologist, and defender. Neither was that man, whosoeuer hee bee, which cals himselfe Macer, inferiour

to Reboul in this kinde, when hee dedicated to Laughter, & to Pleasure, his disputation of that horrible Excommunication of Paulus 5. against the Venetians, and of other matters concerning the saluation of soules. Both which, not contenting themselues, as this Author doth, to sport and obey their naturall disposition in a businesse (if you consider the persons) light inough (for what can bee vainer then a Iesuit?) haue saucily risen vp against Princes, & the Lords Anointed I added moreouer, that the things deliuered in this booke, were by

many degrees more modest, then those which themselues, in their owne ciuill warres, do daily vomit forth, when they butcher and mangle the fame and reputation of their Popes & Cardinals by their reuiued Lucian, Pasquil. At last he yeelded, & made mee owner of his booke, which I send to you to be deliuered ouer to forraine nations, Proculum & farre from the father: and (as his desire is) posthum

of all parts. This Booke must teach what humane infirmity is, and how hard a matter it is for a man much conuersant in the bookes and Acts of Iesuites, so throughly to cast off the Iesuits, as that he contract nothing of their naturall drosles, which are Petulaucy, and Lightnesse.

Of which, I thinke it an honester part as yet to be silent, then to do Galilaeo wrong by speaking Nuncius syd

Yet this they may vouchsafe to take from me, that they shall hardly find Enoch, or Elias any where in their circuit. When I had surueid al the Heauens, then as

As for the Suburbs of Hel (I meane both Limbo and Purgatory) I must confesse I passed them ouer so negligently, that I saw them not: and I was hungerly caried, to find new places, neuer discouered before. For Purgatory did not seeme worthy to me of much diligence, because it may seeme already to haue beene belecued by some persons, in some corners of the Romane Church, for

about 50 yeares; that is, euer since the Councell of Trent had a minde to fulfill the prophecies of Homer, Virgil, and the other Patriarkes of the Papists; and beeing not satisfied with making one Transubstantiation, purposed to bring in another: which is, to change fables into Articles of faith. Proceeding therefore to more inward places, I saw a secret place, where there were not many, beside Lucifer himselfe; to which, onely they had title, which had so attempted any innouation in this life, that they gaue an affront to all antiquitie, and induced doubts, and anxieties, and scruples, and after, a libertie of beleeuing what they would; at length established opinions, directly contrary to all established before.

Sexti, hee promised him a roome in his palace, in the remotest part of his eternall Chaos, which I take to bee this place. And here Pope Boniface 3, and Mahomet, seemed to contend about the highest roome. Hee gloried of hauing expelled an old Religion, and Mahomet of hauing brought in a new: each of them a great deluge to the world. But it is to be feared, that Mahomet will faile therein, both because hee attributed something to the old Testament, and because he vsed Sergius as his fellow-bishop, in making the Alcoran; whereas it was cuident to the supreme

                  fer, (for how could

he be ignorant of that, which himselfe had put into the Popes mind?) that Boniface had not onely neglected, but destroyed the policy of the State of Israel, established in the old Testament, when he prepared Popes a way, to tread vpon the neckes of Princes, but that he also abstained from all Example and Coadiutor, when he took vpon him that newe Name, which Gregorie himselfe (a Pope neither very foolish, nor ouermodest) euer abhord.

               new Orders, which in later times haue broken out, are but little springs, or drops, and that Order the Ocean, which hath sent out 52 Popes, 200 Cardinals, 1600 Archbishops, 4000 Bishops, and 50000 Saints approued by the Church, and therefore it cannot be denied, but that Beniface his part is much releeued by that Order; yet if they be compared to the Iesuits, or to the weake and vnperfect Types of them, the Franciscans, it is no great matter that they haue done. Though therefore they esteeme Mahomet
               
worthy of the name of an Innouator, & therein, perchance not much inferiour to Boniface, yet since his time, to ours, almost all which haue followed his sect, haue liued barren in an vnanimity, and idle concord, and cannot boast that they haue produced any new matter: whereas Boniface his successors, awakened by him, haue euer beene fruitfull in bringing forth new sinnes, and new pardons, and idolatries, and Kingkillings. Though therefore it may religiously, and piously be beleeued, that Turkes, as well as Papists, come daily in troupes to the ordinary and common places of Hell; yet certainly to this more honourable roome, reserued for especiall Innouators, the Papists haue more frequent accesse; and therefore

               Mahomet is out of hope to preuaile, and must imitate the Christian Emperours, and be content to sit (as yet hee doth) at the Popes feet. Now to this place, not onely such endeauour to come, as haue innouated in matters, directly concerning the soule, but they also which haue done so, either in the Arts, or in conuersation, or in any thing which exerciseth the faculties of the soule, and may so prouoke to quarrrelsome and brawling controuersies: For so the truth be lost, it is no matter how. But the gates are seldome opened, nor scarce oftner then once in an Age. But my destiny fauored mce so much, that I was present then, and saw all the pretenders, and all that affected an entrance, and Lucifer himselfe, who then came out

into the outward chamber, to heare them pleade their owne Causes. As soone as the doore creekt, I spied a certaine Mathematician, which till then had bene busied to finde, to deride, to detrude Ptolomey; and now with an erect countenance, and setled pace, came to the gates, and with hands and feet (scarce respecting Lucifer himselfe) beat the dores, and cried; Are these shut against me, to whom all the Heauens were euer open, who was a Soule to the Earth, and gaue it motion?
            
            By this I knew it was Copernicus: For though I had neuer heard ill of his life, and therefore might wonder to find him there; yet when I remembred, that the Papists haue extended the name, & the punishment of

Heresie, almost to euery thing, and that as yet I vsed Gregortes

To whome Lucifer sayd; Who are you? For though euen by this boldnesse you seeme worthy to enter, and haue attempted a new faction euen in Hell, yet you must first satisfie those which stand about you, and which expect the same fortune as you do. Except, O Lucifer, answered Copernicus, I thought thee of the race of the starre Lucifer, with which I am so well acquainted, I should not vouchsafe thee this discourse. I am he, which pitying

thee who wert thrust into the Center of the world, raysed both thee, and thy prison, the Earth, vp into the Heauens; so as by my meanes God doth not enioy his reuenge vpon thee. The Sunne, which was an officious spy, and a betrayer of faults, and so thine enemy, I haue appointed to go into the lowest part of the world. Shall these gates be open to such as haue innouated in small matters? and shall they be shut against me, who haue turned the whole frame of the world, and am thereby almost a new Creator? More then this he spoke not. Lucifer stuck 
                  〈◊〉
                meditation. For what should he do? It seemed vniust to deny entry to him which had deserued so well, and dangerous to

graunt it, to one of so great ambitions, and vndertakings: nor did he thinke that himselfe had attempted greater matters before his fall. Something he had which he might haue conueniently opposed, but he was loath to vtter it, least he should confesse his feare. But Ignatius Layola which was got neere his chaire, a subtile fellow, and so indued with the Diuell, that he was able to tempt, and not onely that, but (as they say) euen to possesse the Diuell, apprehended this perplexity in Lucifer. And making himselfe sure of his owne entrance, and knowing well, that many thous
                  •
               nds of his family aspired to that place, he opposed himselfe against all others. He was content they should bee damned, but not that they should gouerne.

And though when hee died he was vtterly ignorant in all great learning, and knew not so much as Ptolomeys, or Copernicus name, but might haue beene perswaded, that the words Almagest, Zenith, and Nadir, were Saints names, and fit to bee put into the Litanie, and Orapro nobis ioyned to them; yet after hee had spent some time in hell, he had learnt somewhat of his Iesuites, which daily came thither. And whilst he staied at the threshold of Hell; that is, from the time when he deliuered himselfe ouer to the Popes will, hee tooke a little taste of learning. Thus furnished, thus hee vndertakes Copernious.

                   the propagation of the soule; but especially for this,

that he was the first that opposed the dignity of Princes, and imprinted the names of Antichrist, ludas, and other stigmatique markes vpon the Emperour; But for you, what new thing hane you inuented, by which our Lucifer gets any thing? What cares hee whether the earth traueil, or stand still? Hath your raising vp of the earth into heauen, brought men to that confidence, that they build new towers or threaten God againe? Or do they out of thismotion of the earth cō
                  clude, that there is no hell, or deny the punishment of sin? Do not men beleeue? do they not liue iust, as they did before? Besides, this detracts frō the dignity of your learning, and derogates frō your right

and title of comming to this place, that those opinions of yours may very well be true. If therfore any man haue honour or title to this place in this matter, it belongs wholly to our Clauius, who opposed himselfe opportunely against you, and the truth, which at that time was creeping into euery mans minde. Hee onely can be called the Author of all contentions, and schoole-combats in this cause; and no greater profit can bee hoped for heerein, but that for such brabbles, more necessarie matters bee neglected. And yet not onely for this is our Clauius to bee honoured, but for the great paines also which hee tooke in the Gregorian Calender, by which both the peace of the

Church, & Ciuill businesses haue beene egregiously troubled: nor hath heauen it selfe escaped his violēce, but hath euer since obeied his apointments: Harlay defence des lesuites mesdi. 6.

Stephen, Iohn Baptist, & all the rest, which haue bin cōmanded to worke miracles at certain appointed daies, where their Reliques are preserued, do not now attend till the day come, as they were accustomed, but are awaked ten daies sooner, and constrained by him to come downe frō heauen to do that businesse; But your inuentiōs can scarce bee called yours, since long before you, Heraclides, Ecphantus, & Aristarchus thrust them into the world: who notwithstanding content themselues with lower roomes amongst the other

Philosophers, & aspire not to this place, reserued onely for Antichristian Heroes: neither do you agree so wel amongst yourselues, as that you can be said to haue made a Sect, since, as you haue peruerted and changed the order and Scheme of others: so Tycho Brachy hath done by yours, and others by his. Let therefore this little Mathematitian (dread Emperour) withdraw himselfe to his owne company. And if heereafter the fathers of our Order can draw a Cathedrall Decree from the Pope, by which it may be defined as a matter of faith: That the earth doth not moue; & an Antahema inflicted vpon all which hold the contrary: thē perchance both the Pope which shall decree that, and

                  Copernicus his followers, (if they be Papists) may haue the dignity of this place. 
               Lucifer signified his assent; and Copernicus, without muttering a word, was as quiet, as he thinks the sunne, when he which stood next him, entred into his place. To whom Lucifer said: And who are you? Hee answered, 
                  Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast of Hohenheim.
                At this Lucifer trēbled, as if it were a new Exorcisme, & he thought it might well be the first verse of Saint Iohn, which is alwaics imployed in Exorcismes, and might now bee taken out of the Welsh, or Irish Bibles. But when hee vnderstood that it was but the webbe of his name, hee recollected himselfe, and raising himselfe vprig 
                  〈◊〉
               , asked what he had

to say to the great Emperour Sathan, Lucifer, Belzebub, Leuiathan, Abaddon. Paracelsus replyed, It were an iniurie to thee, ô glorious Emperour, if I should deliuer before thee, what I haue done, as though al those things had not proceeded from thee, which seemed to haue bin done by me, thy organe and conduit: yet since I shal rather be thy trumpet herein,' then mine own, some things may be vttered by me. Besides therfore that I broght all Methodicall Phisitians, and the art it selfe into so much contēpt, that that kind of phisick is almost lost; This also was euer my prīcipal purpose, that no certaine new Art, nor fixed rules might be established, but that al remedies might be dangerously drawne from

my vncertaine, ragged, and vnperfect experiments, in triall whereof, how many men haue beene made carkases? And falling vpon those times which did abound with paradoxicall, & vnusuall diseases, of all which, the pox, which then began to rage, was almost the center and sinke; I euer professed an assured and an easy cure thereof, least I should deterre any from their licentiousnesse. And whereas almost all poysons are so disposed and conditioned by nature, that they offend some of the senses, and so are easily discerned and auoided, I brought it to passe, that that trecherous quality of theirs might bee remoued, and so they might safely bee giuen without suspicion, and

yet performe their office as strongly. All this I must confesse, I wrought by thy minerals and by thy fires, but yet I cannot dispaire of my reward, because I was thy first Minister and instrument, in these innouatiōs. By this time Ignatius had obserued a tempest risen in Lucifers countenance: for he was iust of the same temper as Lucifer, and therefore suffered with him in euery thing, and felt al his alterations. That therefore he might deliuer him from `Paracelsus, hee said; You must not thinke sir, that you may heere draw out an oration to the proportion of your name; It must be confessed, that you attempted great matters, and well becomming a great officer of Lucifer, when you vndertook

not onely to make a man, in your Alimbicks, but also to preserue him immortall. And it cannot be doubted, but that out of your Commentaries vpon the Scriptures, in which you were vtterly ignorant, many men haue taken occasion of erring, and thereby this kingdome much indebted to you.

Let me (dread Emperour,) haue leaue to speake truth before thee; These men abuse & prophane too much thy mettals, which are the bowels, and treasure of thy kingdome: For what doth Physicke profit thee?

                   is a sost, & womanish thing. For since no medicine doth naturally
                  
                  draw bloud, that science is not fit nor worthy of our study, Besides why should those things, which belong to you, bee employed to preserue frō deiseases, or to procure long life? were it not fitter, that your brother, and colleague, the Bishop of Rome, which gouernes vpon the face of your earth, and giues dayly increase to your kingdome, should receiue from these helps and subsidies? To him belonges all the Gold, to him all the pretious stones, conceal'd in your entrailes, wherby hee might baite and ensnare the Prince; of the earth through their Lord, and counsellours meanes to his obedience, and to receiue his cōmandements, especially in these times, whē almost euery

where his auncient rights & tributes are denied vnto him. To him belongs your Iron, and the ignobler mettals, to make engines; To him belong your Minerals apt for poyson; To him, the Saltpeter, and all the Elements of Gun-powder, by which he may demolish and ouerthrow Kings and Kingdomes, and Courts, and seates of Iustice. Neither doth Paracelsus truly deserue the name of an Innouator, whose doctrine, Seuerïnus and his other followers do referre to the most ancient times. Thinke therefore your selfe well satisfied, if you be admitted to gouerne in chiefe that Legion of homicide-Phisitians, and of Princes which shall be made away by poyson in the midst

of their sins, and of woemen tempting by paintings and face-phisicke. Of all which sorts great numbers will daily come hither out of your Academy.
               
            
            Content with this sentence, Paracelsus departed; and Machiauel succeeded, who hauing obserued Ignatius his forwardnesse, and saucinesse, and how, vncal'd, he had thrust himselfe into the office of kings Atturney, thought this stupid patience of Copernicus, and Paracelsus (men which tasted too much of their Germany) vnfit for a Florentine: and therefore had prouided some venemous darts, out of his Italian Arsenal, to cast against this worne souldier of Pampel
                     •
                  , this French-spanish mungrell, Ignatius. But when he thought better vpon it, and

obserued that Lucifer euer approued whatsoeuer Ignatius sayd, he suddenly changed his purpose; and putting on another resolution, he determined to direct his speech to Ignatius, as to the principall person next to Lucifer, as well by this meanes to sweeten and mollifie him, as to make Lucifer suspect, that by these honors, & specious titles offered to Ignatius, and entertained by him, his owne dignity might bee eclipsed, or clouded; and that Ignatius by winning to his side, politique men, exercised in ciuill businesses, might attempt some innouation in that kingdome. Thus therefore he began to speake. Dtead Emperour, and you, his watchfull and diligent Genius, father Ignatius, Arch-chancellor of this Court, and highest Priest of

this highest Synagogue (except the primacy of the Romane Church reach also vnto this place) let me before I descend to my selfe, a little consider, speake, and admire your stupendious wisedome, and the gouernment of this state. You may vouchsafe to remember (great Emperour) how long after the Nazarens death, you were forced to liue a solitarie, a barren, and an Eremiticall life: till at last (as it was euer your fashion to imitate heauen) out of your aboundant loue, you begot this deerely beloued sonne of yours, Ignatius, which stands at your right hand. And from both of you proceedes a spirit, whom you haue sent into the world, who triumphing both with

                  Mitre and Crowne, gouernes your Militant Church there. As for those sonnes of Ignatius, whō either he left aliue, or were borne after his death, and your spirit, the Bishop of Rome; how iustly & properly may they be called Equi

                     ocal men? And not only Equiuocall in that sence, in which the Popes Legates, at your Nicene Coūcel were called Equiuocal, because they did agree in all their opinions, and in all their words: but especially because they haue brought into the world a new art of Equiuocation. O wonderfull, and incredible Hypercritiques, who, not out of marble fragments, but out of the secretest Records of Hell it selfe: that is, out of the minds of Lucifer, the `Pope, and Ignatius, (persons

truly equiuocall) haue raised to life againe the language of the Tower of Babel,

                   noble paire of Emperours) that I may freely cōfesse the truth all which I haue done, where soeuer there shall be mention made of the Iesuites, can be reputed but childish;

that those gates, into which such men could conceiue any hope of entrance, should not voluntarily flie open to mee: yet I can better endure the rashnesse and fellowship of Paracelsus, then the other: because hee hauing beene conueniently practised in the butcheries, and mangling of men, hee had the reason to hope for fauour of the Iesuites: For I my selfe went alwaies that way of bloud, and therefore I did euer preferre the sacrifices of the Gentiles, and of the Iewes, which were performed with effusion of bloud (whereby not only the people, but the Priests also were animated to bold enterprises) befote the soft and wanto sacrifices of Christians.
                  
If I might haue had my choyce, I should rather haue wished, that the Romane Church had taken the Bread, then the Wine, from the people, since in the wine there is some colour, to imagine and represent blood. Neither did you, (most Reuerend Bishop of this Dioces, Ignatius) abhorre from this way of blood. For hauing consecrated your first age to the wars, and growne somewhat vnable to follow that course, by reason of a wound; you did presently begin to thinke seriously of a spirituall warre, against the Church, and found meanes to open waies, euer into Kings chambers, for your executioners. Which dignitie, you did not reserue onely to your own Order, but

(though I must confesse, that the foundation, and the nourishment of this Doctrine remaines with you, and is peculiar to you, out of your infinite liberalitie,) you haue vouchsafed sometime, to vse the hands of other men in these imploiments. And therefore as well they, who haue so often in

But yet although the entrance into this place may be decreed to none, but to Innouators, and to onely such of them as haue dealt in Christian businesse; and of thē also, to those only which haue had the fortune to doe

much harme, I cannot see but that next to the Iesuites, I must bee inuited to enter, since I did not onely teach those wayes, by which, thorough perfidiousnesse and dissembling of Religion, a

and turbulencies Lucifer vnderstood very wel, he thought Machiauel a fit and necessarie instrument to oppose against him; that so the skales beeing kept euen by their factions, hee might gouerne in peace, and two poysons mingled might doe no harme. But hee could not hide this intention from Ignatius, more subtil then the De

It had beene reason, that they should first haue exercised their force vpon those verses, and so haue purged and deliuered them, if not from Heresie, yet from Barbarousnesse, and solecismes; that Heretiques might not iustly say, there was no truth in any of them, but onely the last; which is,

To these men certainly the Pope doth no more grudge the plurality of sins, then he doth of Bonafices. And he hath beene content, that euen Borgia shoud enioy this dignity, if hee hath heaped vp, by his ingenious wickednesse, more sorts of sins in one Act, then (as far as I know) as any the Popes thē selues haue attempted: For he did not only giue the full reine to his licentiousnesse, but raging with a second ambition, hee would also change the Sex. Therein also his stomacke was not towardes young beardlesse boyes, nor such greene fruit: for hee did not thinke, that hee went farre inough from the right Sex, except hee had a manly, a reuerend, and a bearded Venus. Neither

staied he there; but his witty lust proceeded further: yet he sollicited not the Minions of the Popes; but striuing to equall the licentiousnesse of Sodomits, which would haue had the Angels; to come as neare them as hee could, hee tooke a Cleargy-man, one of the portion and lot of the Lord: and so made the maker of God, a Priest subiect to his lust; nor did hee seeke him out in a Cloyster, or Quire; but that his Venus might bee the more monstrous, hee would haue her in a Mitre. And yet his prodigious lust was not at the height; as much as hee could he added: and hauing found a

him by force. Since then the Popes doe, out of the fulnesse of their power, come to those kindes of sinne, which haue neither Example nor Name, in somuch that Pope Paulus

dignity of the Popes, when he hath affoorded to them sins common to all the world. The transferring of Empires, rhe ruine of Kingdomes, the Excommunications, and depositions of Kings, & deuastations by fire and sword, should haue bene produced as their marks & characters: for though the examples of the Popes trāsferring the Empire, which our men so much stand vpon, bee not indeede true, nor that the anciēt Popes practised any such thing; yet since the states-men of our Order, wiser thē the rest, haue found how much this Temporal iurisdictio ouer Princes, cō

This then is the point of which wee accuse Machiuell, that he carried not his Mine so safely, but that the enemy perceiued it still. But wee, who haue receiued the Church to be as a ship, do freely saile in the deep sea; we haue an anchor, but wee ha

that as to sailing shippes, so to our sailing Church, all rocks, all promontories, all firme and fast places are dangerous, and threaten shipwracke, and therefore to bee auoyded, and liberty and searoome to bee affected; yet I doe not obstinatly say, that there is nothing in Machiuels commentary, which may bee of vse to this Church. Certainely there is very much; but wee are not men of that pouerty, that wee neede begge from others, nor dignify those things with our prayers, which proceede not from our selues. The Senate of Rome gaue vs heeretofore a noble example of this temperance and abstinence, which therefore refused

to place Christ amongst their gods, because the matter was proposed by the Emperour, and begunne not in themselues. As for that particular, wherein Machiauel vseth especially to glory; which is, that he brought in the liberty of dissembling, and lying, it hath neither foundation nor colour: For not onely Plato, and other fashioners of Common-

                  definition of the Church had established the contrarie. Which certainely, (though this should not be so openly spoken of) as yet was neuer done. But yet wee haue departed from this doctrine of free lying, though it were receiued in practise, excused by the Fathers, strengthened by examples of

Neither hath our Bellarmine almost any other cause of aduauncing Monarchicall gouernmēt so much as he doth, then thereby to remoue all secular men from so great a dignitie, and to reserue it only to the Church. It was therfore well done of that Rebullus (who now begins to bee knowne in this state) when hauing surfeited with Calumnies against the French Church, and her Ministers, he hath dared of late to draw his pen, and to ioyne battell against a most puissant forraine Prince: hee did well (I say) and fitly, when hee called

fire and sword, so we stand watchfull vpon the borders of our Church, not onely prouided, as that Cherubin was with sire and sword, but with the later inuention of Gunpowder; about the first inuentour whereof I wonder, why Antiquaries should contend, whether it were the Diuell or a Frier, since that may be all one. But as (O vnspeakable Emperour) you haue almost in all things endeuoured to imitate God: so haue you most throughly performed it in vs; For when God attempted the Reformation of his Church, it became you also to reforme yours. And accordingly by your Capuchins, you did reforme your Franciscans; which, before we arose, were your chiefest labourers, and

workemen: and after, you Reformed your Capuchins, by your Recolets. And when you perceiued that in the Church of God, some men proceeded so farre in that Reformation, that they endeuoured to draw out, not onely all the peccant and dangerous humours, but all her beautie, and exteriour grace and Ornament, and cuen her vitall spirits, with her corrupt bloud, & so induce a leannesse, and il-fauourednes vpon her, and thought to

                Truely I thought this Oration of Ignatius very long: and I began to thinke of my body which I had so long abandoned, least it should putrifie, or grow mouldy, or bee buried; yet I was loath to leaue the stage, till I saw the play ended: And I was in hope, that if any such thing should befall my body, the Iesuits, who work Miracles so familiarly, & whose

reputation I was so careful of in this matter, would take compassion vpon me, and restore me againe. But as I had sometimes obserued

               , I perceiued him to bee affected towardes Ignatius, as Princes, who though they enuy and grudge, that their great Officers should haue such immoderate meanes to get wealth; yet they dare not complaine of it, least thereby they should make them odious and contemptible to the people: so that Lucifer now suffered a new Hell: that is, the danger of a Popular Diuell, vaine-glorious, and inclined to innouations there. Therefore he determined to withdraw himselfe into his inward chamber, and to admit none but Ignatius: for he could not exclude him, who had deserued so well; neither did hee thinke it safe to stay without, & giue him more occasiōs to amplifie his owne worth, & vndervalue

all thē there in publique, and before so many vulgar Diuels. But as hee rose, a whole army of soules besieged him. And all which had inuented any new thing, euen in the smallest matters, thronged about him, and importuned an admission. Euen those which had but inuented new attire for woemen, & those whom Pancirollo hath recorded in his Commentaries for inuention De rebus nuper

And of those, which pretended that they had squared the circle, the nūber was infinite. But Ignatius scattered all this cloud quickly, by commaunding, by chiding, by deriding, and by force & violence. Amongst the rest, I was sory to see him vse Peter Aretine so ill

as he did: For though Ignatius told him true when he boasted of his licentious pictures, that because he was not much learned, hee had left out many things of that kind, with which the ancient histories & poëmes abound; and that therefore Aretine had not onely not added any new inuention, but had also taken away all courage and spurres frō youth, which would rashly trust, and relie vpon his diligence, and seeke no further, & 
                  〈◊〉
                loose that infinite & precious treasure of Antiquitie. He added moreouer, that though Raderus, and others of his Order, did vse to gelde Poets, and other Authors: (and heere I could not choose but wonder, why they haue not gelded their Vulgar Edition, which in some places hath such obscene words

In which, as in the diuine, it bindes the Layety to one species; but they reserue to themselues the diuers formes, and the secrets and mysteries in this matter, which they finde in the Authors whom they geld. Of which kind I thinke they giue a little glimmering and intimation, when in the life of their last made Goddesse, Francisca Romana, 
               Valladerius fol. 24.
                they say: that the bed where shee lay with her husband, was a perpetuall Martyrdome to her, and a shop of miracles. But for all this, since Aretine was one, who

by a long
                  •
                custome of libellous & contumelious speaking against Princes, had got such a habit, that at last he came to diminish and dis-esteeme God himselfe. I wonder truly, that this Arch-Iesuite, though hee would not admit him to any eminent place in his Triumphant Church, should deny him an office of lower estimation: For truly to my thinking, he might haue beene fit, either to serue Ignatius, as maister of his pleasures, or Lucifer as his Crier: for whatsoeuer Lucifer durst think, this man durst speake. But Ignatius, who thought himselfe sufficient for all vses, thrust him away, and when he offered vpward, offered his staffe at him: Nor did he vse Christopher Columbus with any better respect; who hauing found all waies in

the earth, & sea open to him, did not feare any difficulty in Hell, but when hee offered to enter, Ignatius staid him, & said: You must remember, sir, that if this kingdome haue got any thing by the discouery of the West Indies, al that must be attributed to our Order: for if the opinion of the Dominicans had Matalius Metellus, Praefat. in

But although Lucifer being put into a heate, and almost smothered with this troupe and deluge of pretenders, seemed to haue admitted Ignatius, as his Lieutenant, or Legat a latere, and trusted him with an absolute power of doing what hee would, yet he quickly spied his owne errour, and danger thereby. He began to remember how forcibly they

Therefore Lucifer thought it time for him to enter into the businesse, least at last Ignatius should prescribe therein; by which title of prescription he well knew, how much the Church of Rome doth aduaunce and defend it selfe against other Princes. And though he seemed very thankfull to Ignatius, for his deliuery from this importunate company, yet when he perceiued, that his scope and purpose was, to keepe all others out, he thought the case needed greater consideration; For though he had a confidence in his owne Patriarkes, which had long before possest that place, and in whose company (as an

               Abbot said to the Diuell, 
               Sophronius ca. 45. Consenuerat. who after long intermission, now tempted him) hee was growne old, and do

               bted not but that they would defend their right, and oppose themselues against any innouation, which Ignatius should practise, yet if none but hee in a whole age should bee brought in, hee was afraid, that this singularity would both increase his courage and spirit, and their reuerence, and respect towards him. Casting therefore his eyes into euery corner, at last a great way off, hee spied `Phillip Nerius: who acknowledging in his owne particular no especiall merit towardes this kingdome, forbore to presse neere the gate; But Lucifer called to his remembrance, that Nerius and all

that Order, of which hee was the Author, which is called congregatio Oratorij, were erected, aduaunced, and dignisyed by the Pope, principally to this end, that, by their incessant Sermons to the people, of the liues of Saints and other Ecclesiastique Antiquities, they might get a new reputation, and so the torrent, and generall superstition towards the Iesuits, might grow a little remisser, and luke-warme: for at that time the Pope himselfe beganne to bee afraid of the Iesuites, for they begunne to publish their Paradox of Confession and absolution to bee giuen by letters, and Messengers, and by that meanes to draw the secrets of all Princes onely to themselues; And they

had tried and sollicited a great Monarch, who hath manie designes vpon Italy, against the Pope, & deliuered to that prince diuerse articles, for the reforming of him. Now the Pope and Lucifer loue euer to follow one anothers example: And therefore that which the one had done in the middle world, the other attempted in the lower. Hereupō he called for Philip Nerius, and gaue him many euidences of a good inclination towards him. But Nerius was too stupid, to interprete them aright. Yet Ignatius spied them, and before Lucifer should declare himselfe any further, or proceed too farre herein, least after he were farre engaged, there should be no way, to auert or withdraw him from his owne propositions (for he saw

there must be respect had of his honour and constancy) hee thought it fittest to oppose now at the beginning. He sayd therfore, that he now perceiued, that Lucifer had not bene altogether so much conuersant with Philip as with the Iesuits, since he knew not, how much Philip had euer professed himselfe an enemy to him.

            To all this Nerius sayde nothing,

as though it had beene spoken of some body else. Without doubt, either he neuer knew, or had forgot that he had done those things which rhey write of him. But Lucifer himselfe tooke the boldnesse (hauing with some difficultio got Ignatius leaue) to take Nerius his part: and proceeded so farre, that he aduentured to say, that 
                  Baronius, Bozius, and others, which proceeded out of the Hyue of Nerius, had vsed a more free, open, and hard fashion against Princes, and better prouided for the Popes Direct Iurisdiction vpon all Kingdomes, and more stoutly defēded it, then they; which vndertaking the cause more tremblingly, then becomes the Maiestie of so

great a businesse, adhered to `Bellarmines sect, and deuised such crooked wayes, and such perplexed intanglings, as by reason of the various, and vncertaine circumstances, were of no vse: And that whatsoeuer Nerius his schollers had performed, must be attributed to him, as the fruit to the roote. 
               Ignatius perceiuing that Lucifer vndertooke all offices for Nerius, and became Iudge, Aduocate, and witnesse, pursuing his former resolution, determined to interrupt him, least when hee had enlarged himselfe in Nerius commendation, hee should thereby bee bound to a reward. He therefore cried out, What hath Nerius done? what hath he, or his followers put in execution? haue they not euer

bene onely exercised in speculations, and in preparatory doctrines? Are these bookes which are written of the Iurisdiction of the Pope, to any better vse then Phisitians Lectures of diseases, and of Medicines? whilest these Receits lie hid in Phisitians bookes, and no body goes to the Patient; no body applies the medicine to the disease, what good, what profit comes by all this? what part; what member of this languishing body haue they vndertaken? In what Kingdome haue they corrected these humours, which offend the Pope, either by their Incision or cauterising? what state haue they cut vp into an

Do they hope to cure their diseases, by talking and preaching, as it were with charmes and enchantments? If Nerius shall bee thought worthy of this Honour, and this place, because out of his schollers writings something may be gleaned, which may be applied to this purpose, why should we not haue Beza and Caluin, and the rest of that sort here in Hell, since in their bookes there may be some things found, which may be wrefted to this purpose? But, since their scope was not to extirpate Monarchies, since they publis

which seldome fall out, since they deliuered nothing dangerous to Princes, but where, in their opinion, the Souereignty resided in the People, or in certaine Ephori, since they neuer said, that this power to violate the perso of a prince, might either be takē by any priuate man, or committed to him, & that therefore none of their disciples hath euer boasted of hauing done any thing vpon the person of his soueraigne: we see that this place hath euer bene shut against them: there haue bene some few of thē (though I can scarce affoord those mē the honour to number them with Knox, and Goodman, and Buchanan) which following our examples haue troubled the peace of some states, and

beene iniurious to some princes, and haue beene admitted to some place in this Kingdome; but since they haue performed nothing with their hands, nor can excuse themselues by saying, they were not able: (for wherein was Clement, or Rauillac more able then they; or what is not he able to doe in the middest of an Army, who despiseth his owne life?) they scarce euer aspire, or offer at this secret and sacred Chamber. Lucifer had a purpose to haue replied to this: that perchaunce all their hands which had bin imbrued in the bowels of Princes, were not so immediatly armed by the Iesuits, as that they were euer present at all consultations and resolutions: (and yet he meant to

say this, not as sworne witnesse, but as Lucifer himselfe, & the father of lies, in which capacitie he might say any thing) But that it was inough that Confessours do so possesse them with that doctrine, that it is not now proposed to them as Phisicke, but as naturall food, and ordinarie diet; and that therfore for the performance of these things, a Iesuits person is no more requisite, then that the heart of a man, because it sends forth spirits into euery limbe, should therefore bee present in euery limbe: that when it

This Lucifer would haue spoken; but hee thought it better and easier to forbeare: for hee obserued, that Ignatius had giuē a signe, & that all his troupes which were many,

subtile, & busie, set vp their bristles, grumbled, and compacted themselues into one body, gathered, produced, and vrged all their euidence, whatsoeuer they had done, or suffered. There the English Legion, which was called Capistrata, which Hal

                  rius a secret warning to withdraw himselfe, & spoke no more of him; and despairing of bringing in an other, began earnestly to thinke, how hee might leaue Ignatius out. This therefore he said to him:

               I am sorry my Ignatius, that I can neither find in others, deserts worthy of this place, nor any roome in this place worthy of your deserts. If I might die, I see there would be no longe strife for a successour: For if you haue not yet done that act which I did at first in Heauen, and thereby got this Empire, this may excuse you, that no man hath beene able to tell you what it was: For if any of the Auncients say true, when they call it Pride, or Licentiousnesse, or Lying: or if it be in any of the Casuistis, which professe the Art of sinning, you cānot be accused of hauing omitted it. But since I may neithor forsake this kingdome, nor diuide it, this onely remedy is left: I will write to the Bishop of Rome: he shall

call Galilaeo the Florentine to him; who by this time hath throughly instructed himselfe of all the hills, woods, and Cities in the new world, the Moone. And since he effected so much with his first Glasses, that he faw the Moone,

And thither (because they euer claime that those imployments of discouery belong to them) shall all the Iesuites bee transferred,

and easily vnite and reconcile the Lunatique Church to the Romane Church, without doubt, after the Iesuites haue been there a litle while, there will soone grow naturally a Hell in that world also: ouer which, you Ignatius shall haue dominion, and establish your kingdome & dwelling there. And with the same ease as you passe from the earth to the Moone, you may passe frō the Moone to the other starrs, which are also thought to be worlds, & so you may beget and propagate many Hells, & enlarge your Empire, & come neerer vnto that high seate, which I left at

               Ignatius had not the patience to stay till Lucefer had made an end; but as soone as hee saw him pause, and take breath, and

looke, first vpon his face, to obserue what changes were there, and after to cast his eye to an other place in Hell where a great noyse was suddenly raysed: hee apprehended this intermission, and as though Lucifer had ended, he said: That of Lucifers affection to the Romane Church, and to their Order euery day produced new Testimonies: and that this last was to bee accounted as one of the greatest. That he knew well with how great deuotion the Bishop of Rome did euer embrace and execute all counsels proceeding from him: And that therefore he hoped, that hee would reserue that imployment for the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and that Empire for him their founder: and that he beleeued the Pope
                  
had thought of this before; and at that time when he put Parsons the English Iesuite in hope of a Cardinalship, hee had certainly a reference to this place, and to this Church: That it would fall out shortly, that all the damages, which the Romane Church hathlately suffered vpon the earth, shall bee recompenced onely there. And that, now this refuge was opened, if she should be reduced into greater streights, or if she should be vtterly exterminated, the world would not much lament and mourne for it. And for the entertainment of the Iesuites there, there can be no doubt made at this time, when, (although their profession bee to enter whether Princes will or no) all the

Princes of the world will not onely graciously affoord them leaue to goe, but willingly and cheerfully accompany them with Certificates, and Dimissory letters. Nor would they much resist it, if the Pope himselfe would vouchsafe to go with them, and so fulfill in some small measure, that prophecy of his Gerson, De Auferibilitate Papae. Besides this a woman gouernes there; of which Sex they haue euer made their profite, which haue attempted any Innouation in religion; with how much diligence were the two Empresses Pulcheria & Eudoxia sollicited by the Pope for the establishing of Easter? how earnestly did both Pelagius and the Pope striue by their letters to

In these aduantages we must play our parts, & put our deuises in practise: for

at these times any thing may be drawne from her. Nor must we forbeare to try, what verses, and incantations may worke vpon her: For in those things which the Poets writ, though they themselues did not beleeue them, we haue since found many truths, and many deep mysteries: nor can I call to minde any woman, which either deceiued our hope, or scaped our cunning, but Elizabeth of England; who might the rather be pardoned that, because she had put off all affections of woemen. The principall Dignity of which sex, (which is, to be a Mother) what reason had she to wish, or affect, since without those womanish titles, vnworthy of her, of wife, & mother, such an heire was otherwise

prouided for her, as was not fit to be kept any longer from the inheritance. But when I, who hate them, speake thus much in the honour of these two Princes, I finde my selfe caried with the same fury, as those Beasts were, which our men say, did sometime adore the Host in the Masse.

ancient Relioion was so much worne out, that to reduce that to the former dignity, and so to renew it, was a kinde of lanouation: and by this way of innouating shee satisfied the infirmity of her Sex, if shee suffered any: for a little Innouation might serue her, who was but a little a woman. Neither dare I say, that this was properly an Innovation, lest there by I should confesse that Luther and many others which liue in banishment in Heaven farre from vs, might haue a title to this place, as such Innouators.

                  Lucifer asked the cause, it was told him, that there was a soule newly arriued in Hell, which said that the Pope was at last entreated to make Ignatius a Saint, and that hee hastened his Canonization, as thinking it

an vniust'thing, that when all artificers, and prophane Butchers had particular Saints to inuocate, only these spirituall Butchers, and King-killers, should haue none: for when the Iesuite Cotton in those questions which by vertue of his inuisible priuiledge he had prouided for a possest person, amongst others, dangerous both to England and France, had inserted this question: What shall I do for Ignatius his Canonizing? and found out at last, that Philip, King of Spaine, and Henry, King of Fraunce, contended by their Ambassadors at Rome, which of them should haue the honour of obtaining his Canonizing (for both pretending to be King of Nauarre, both pretended that this right and honour belonged to him: and so

both deluded the Iesuits:) For Pi

At last hee despaired of hauing any assistance from these Princes; nor did he thinke it conuenient, that a Iesuite should be so much beholden to a King, since Baronius was already come to that Litera eius ad Philip 3.
                heighth and constancy, that being accused of some wronges done to his King, hee did not vouchsafe to write in his owne excuse to the King, till the Conclaue which was then held, was fully ended, least (as himselfe giues the reason) if hee had then beene chosen Pope, it should bee thought hee had beene beholden to the King therein. For these reasons therefore they labour the Pope
               
themselues. They confesse, that if they might choose, they had rather hee should restore them into all which they had lost in Fraunce, and Venice, then that Ignatius should be sent vp into Heauen; and that the Pope was rather bound to do so, by the Order which God himselfe seemes to haue obserued in the Creation, where he first furnished 
                  Gen. 2.4. the Earth, and then the Heauens, and confi

                He would also haue giuen this title of Saint rather to Xauerius, who had the reputation of hauing done Miracles. Indeed he would haue done any thing, so hee might haue slipped ouer Ignatius. But at last hee is ouercome; and so against the will of Heauen, and of the Pope, Lucifer himselfe being not very forward in it, Ignatius must bee thrust in amongst the Saints. All this discourse, I, beeing growne cunninger then that Doctor, Gabriell Nele (of whom Bartolus speaketh) L. 1. de veroblig. that by the onely motion of his lippes, without any vtterance, vnderstood all men, perceiued and read in

euery mans countenance there. These thinges, as soone as Lucifer apprehended them, gaue an end to the contention; for now hee thought he might no longer doubt nor dispute of Ignatius his admission, who, besides his former pretences, had now gotten a new right and title to the place, by his Canonization; and he feared that the Pope would take all delay ill at his handes, because Canonization is now growne a kinde of Declaration, by which all men may take knowledge, that such a one, to whom the Church of Rome is much beholden, is now made partaker of the principall dignities, and places in Hell: For these men euer make as though they would follow Augustine in all things, and therefore they

prouide that that also shall bee true which he said in this point: That the Reliques of many are honoured vpon earth whose soules are tormented in Hell. Therefore he tooke Ignatius by the hand, and led him to the gate. In the meane time, I, which doubted of the truth of this report of his Canonizing, went a little out for further instruction: for I thought it scarce credible, that Paulus 5. who had but lately burdened both the Citie of Rome, and the Church, with so great expences, when he canonized Francisca Romana, would so easily proceed to canonize Ignatius now, when neither any prince offered to beare the charge, nor so much as sollicited it: for so he must bee forced to waste both the Treasures of the Church at once. And

from Leo 3. who 800 yeares after Christ, is the first Pope which Canonized any, I had not obserued that this had euer beene done: Neither do I think that Paulus 5. was drawne to the Can onizing of this woman by any other respect, then because that Rule which shee appointed Valladerius fol. 57.
                to her Order, was Dictated and written by Saint Paul: For though Peter, and Magdalene, and others, were present at the writing thereof, as witnesses, yet Paul was the Author thereof. And since Saint Pauls old Epistles trouble and dis-aduantage this Church, they were glad to apprehend any thing of his new writing, which might be for them, that so this new worke of his might beare witnesse of his second conuersion to Papistry, since by

his first conuersion to Christianity, they got nothing: for to say, that in this businesse Paulus 5. could not choose but be God, God himselfe, to say, that hee must needes haue liued familiarly with the God-head: and must haue heard Predestination it selfe whispering to him: And must haue had a place to sit in Councell with the most Diuine Trinitie, (all which Valladerius sayes of him) is 
                  Fol. 5. not necessary in this matter, wherein the Popes, for the most part, proceed, as humane affections leade them. But at last, after some enquiry, I found that a certaine idle Gazettier, which vsed to scrape vp Newes, and Rumours at Rome, and so to make vp sale letters, vainer, and falser, then the Iesuites Letters of Iapan, and the Indies, had brought

this newes to Hell, and a little Iesuiticall Nouice, a credulous soule, receiued it by his implicit faith, and published it. I laughed at Lucifers easinesse to beleeue, and I saw no reason euer after, to accuse him of infidelity. Vpon this I came backe againe, to spie (if the gates were stil open) with what affection Ignatius, and they who were in auncient possession of that place, behaued themselues towardes one an other. And I found him yet in the porch, and there beginning a new contention: for hauing presently cast his eyes to the principall place, next to Lucifers owne Throne, and finding it possest, he stopt Lucifer, and asked him, who it was that sate there. It was answered, that it was Pope Boniface;
               
to whom, as to a principall Innouator, for hauing first chalenged the name of Vniuersall Bishop, that honour was affoorded. Is he an Innouator thundred Ignatius? shall I suffer this, when all my Disciples haue laboured all this while to proue to the world, that all the Popes before his time did vse that name? And that Gregory did not reprehend the Patriarch Iohn for taking to himselfe an Antichristian name, but for vsurping a name which was due to none but the Pope. And could it be fit for you, Lucifer, (who in this were either vnmindfull of the Romane Church, or else too weake and incapable of her secrets and mysteries) to giue way to any sentence in Hell, which (though it were

according to truth,) yet differed from the Iesuites Oracles? With this Ignatius flyes vpwardes, and rushes vpon Boniface, and throwes him out of his Seate: And Lucifer went vp with him as fast, and gaue him assistance, least, if hee should forsake him, his owne seate might bee endangered. And I returned to my body; which

                  As a flower wet with last nights dew, and then
                  Warm'd with the new Sunne, doth shake of agen

                  Those beames return'd, which had not long time shin'd,
               
               
was with this returne of my soule sufficiently resreshed. And when I had seene all this, and considered how fitly and pronortionally Rome & Hell an wered one another, after I had seene a Iesuit turne the Pope out of his Chaire in Hell, I suspected that that Order would attempt as much at Rome.
            
         
         
            
            
            An Apology for Iesuites.
            
            
               NOW is it time to come to the Apology for Iesuites: that is, it is time to leaue speaking of them, for hee fauours them most, which saies least of them; Nor can any man, though hee had declaimed against them till all the sand of the sea were run through his houre-glasse, lacke matter to adde of their practises.

If any man haue a minde to adde any thing to this Apology, hee hath my leaue; and I haue therefore left roome for three or foure lines. which is enough for such a paradox: and more then Iungius, Scribanius, Gretzerus, Richeomus, Cydonius, and all the rest which are vsed to Apologies, and almost tyred with a defensiue warre, are able to employ, if they will write onely good things, and true, of the Iesuites. Neither Bo

               Parliaments of England, and France deny of the Iesuites. But if any man thinke this Apology too short, he may thinke the whole booke an Apology, by this rule of their owne- That it is their greatest

               argument of innocency to be accused by vs. At this time, whilst they are yet somewhat able to do some harme, in some places, let them make much of this Apology. It will come to passe shortly, when as they haue bene disspoyled and expelled at Venice, and shaked and fanned in France, so they will bee forsaken of other Princes, and then their owne weakenesse will bee their Apology,
               
and they will grow harmelesse out of necessity, and that which Vegetius sayd of Li. 1. ca. 14.
                chariots armed with sithes and hookes, will be applied to the Iesuites, at first they were a terror, and after a scorne.
