In which number your ſelfe (eſpecially of your place and quality) are one of the chiefe, that euer I knew, both for skill, and loue of this poore, though diuine Science, whereof I am a Profeſſour. Indeede this, and all other Arts haue no enemies, but ſuch as know them not; ſuch as know them, can no more chooſe but loue them, then their owne eyes, or the light. But for your ſelfe, it is hard for me to ſay, whether your skill in this Art, among many other, hath made you loue it ſo much, or your loue of it made you ſo skilfull in it: Onely this I am ſure of, that when I began to bethinke with my ſelfe to whom to Dedicate theſe Songs, I could finde none, to whom they might come more welcome then your ſelfe; none who was like to entertaine them more willingly, could vnderſtand them better, or make more true vſe of them. Yours therefore they ſhall be hereafter, they ſhall call you Patron, and vnder your protection come abroad, if you will be pleaſ'd (whereof I aſſure my ſelfe) to doe him ſo much honour to accept of them, which ſo much honours you, and will alwayes reſt at your command

                     SIR:
                  
                  
                     ALL the Arts and Sciences which we know, and vſe at this day, are come to the ripeneſſe and flouriſhing in which they are, by the encouragement that Noble Spirits haue from time to time afforded vnto ſuch, as haue by nature or education been inclined to the ſpeciall ſtudy and profeſsion of them; It cannot be denied, but there be too few (of rancke and qualitie) which are pleaſed to caſt a louing, and a gracious eye vpon Arts, and Artiſts, and loue Arts for the Arts themſelues; yet the world, neither in this Kingdome, nor abroad, is as yet ſo farre degenerated, but it daily yeeldes ſome ſupply of ſuch worthy perſons as are delighted in ſome liberall Science, or other; And whilſt they pleaſe themſelues, grace, and confirme the good endeauours of others. In which number your ſelfe (eſpecially of your place and quality) are one of the thiefe, that euer I knew, both for skill, and loue of this poore, though diuine Science, whereof I am a Profeſſour. Indeede this, and all other Arts haue no enemies, but ſuch as know them not; ſuch as know them, can no more chooſe but loue them, then their owne eyes, or the light. But for your ſelfe, it is hard for me to ſay, whether your skill in this Art, among many other, hath made you loue it ſo much, or your loue of it made you ſo skilfull in it: Onely this I am ſure of, that when I began to bethinke with my ſelfe to whom to Dedicate theſe Songs, I could finde none, to whom they might come more welcome then your ſelfe; none who was like to entertaine them more willingly, could vnderſtand them better, or make more true vſe of them. Yours therefore they ſhall be hereafter, they ſhall call you Patron, and vnder your protection come abroad, if you will be pleaſ'd (whereof I aſſure my ſelfe) to doe him ſo much honour to accept of them, which ſo much honours you, and will alwayes reſt at your command
                  
                     Your deuoted poore friend, MICHAEL EAST.
