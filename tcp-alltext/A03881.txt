OF THE
VVRITTEN VVORD
OF GOD.

In Latin, by the Reuerend Father Iames Gordon
Huntley of Scotland, Doctour of
Diuinity, of the Society of

of the same Society.

            Permissu Superiorum, M. DC. X IV.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            THE
FIRST CHAPTER.
            Of the Scope and Methode of this
Treatise.
            
               ALL the Controuersies of this
time may be reduced to two
heades, for eyther they are
certayne generall principles
& foundations of our faith and religion,
or they are particuler questions appertayning
to the same. Amongst other generall
principles there are two, about
which there is greatest contention at this
day: the one is the Word of God, the other
the Church: we will first speake of
the word of God, and afterwardes of the
Church, and lastly we will examine euery
particuler Controuersy, if God shall

                  •
               raunt vs life and health. Two thinges

there are which now adayes hold many
in error. The one is a 
                  〈◊〉
                opinion that
many haue, who thinke it a matter of
little importance, whether they giue
credit or no to many things taught by the
Roman Church, which daungerous perswasion
may be taken out of the mind
                  •
               s
of all faithfull people, by that which we
shall deliuer cōcerning the Word of God,
and the Church, for thereby it shall euidently
appeare, that al thinges are firmely
to be belieued, which the Roman
Church belieueth, and that without
this faith no man can hope to be saued.
The other is, that such as de
                  •
               ire to find
out the true faith in euery particuler Cō
               trouersy,
are oftentimes so hindred by the
sleights and falshoods of our aduersaryes,
as it willbe very hard for them to
discerne that which is true from that
which is false. Wherfore we will endeauour
in euery particuler Controuersy, to
set downe the true state of the question.
Afterward we will lay open the foundation
of the Catholike doctrine. And lastly
we will plainly and briefly answere
the chiefe obiections of our Aduersaries
whether they be drawne out of the Scriptures,
or taken from the Fathers.
            2. And because our Aduersaries euermore

boast and brag of the written
Word of God, pretending out of it only
to proue their doctrine & impugne ours:
our chiefe care shalbe to shew, that the
Catholike and Roman faith is both euidently
and strongly to be confirmed out
of the written Word of God, and the doctrine
of our Aduersaries hath no foundation
at all in the holy Scriptures, but
is manifestly opposite & repugnant therunto,
yet so, as we will set downe the
vniforme consēt of the auncient Church
to be agreeing with vs in euery Controuersy,
leauing the more ample search of
antiquity, vnto others, to whome we
will referre the Reader, setting downe
their particuler names; so loath we are
that this booke of ours should grow too
great: and for the same reason we haue
thought good to omit many arguments
which might be drawne out of the holy
Scriptures for confirmation of the Catholike
faith, contenting our selues to
set downe only the more solide and euident
proofes, because we are resolued to be
as briefe as we may.
         
         
            
            CHAP. II.
            Of the Word of God in generall.
            THE word of God, if we speake
of it in generall, may be considered
two wayes, either for that
One, Eternall and Infinite Word
which contayneth perfectly in it selfe
whatsoeuer is in the mind of Almighty
God, which is the same with the Sonne
of God, and Word of the Father, of
whome S. Iohn speaketh in his Ghospell
saying: In the beginning was the VVord, but of
this Word we are to say nothing heere▪
but the Word of God may be other wise cō
               sidered
and taken for that Word which
was not alwayes, nor contayneth all
thinges which are in the mind of God
but a small part only of them, to wit, such
thinges as God would haue vs know and
belieue: and of the Word of God in this
sense we speake now. For this Word is
the proper and complete obiect of our
faith.
            2. Moreouer this Word hath two
conditions or properties, the one is, that
the same be reuealed vnto vs, for there are

innumerable verities in the mind of God
the which because they are not reuealed
to vs, do not appertayne to this Word.
The other is, that it be immediatly reuealed
by God, for such thinges as God manifesteth
vnto vs by naturall reason appertayne
not to this word of God,Rom. 
                     •
                  . v. 19. & 20. called
therfore by the Deuines the reuealed
Word of God.Hebr. 11. vers. 1.
            
            3. Of this Word of God so vnderstood
there is no Controuersy betwene
vs and our Aduersaries, but only in
wordes: for wheras our Aduersaries say
that Catholikes affirme, that we must
with diuine fayth belieue the words of
men, or which is worse, rather belieue the
words of men then the Word of God, it
is a meere slaunder, for there is no Catholike
so ignorant but he knoweth that
the Theologicall vertue Faith relieth astogeather
vpon the pure, sincere, and certayne
Word of God alone, according to
that of S. Paul,
               1. Thessal. 
                     •
                  . vers. 13. 
               when you had receiued of vs the
word of the heating of God you receaued it not as
the word of men, but as the VVord of God, as indeed
it is. Neyther can any man doubt but
that the reuealed word of God is partly
the written Word contayned in the Canonicall
bookes of the old and new Testament,
partly vnwritten and deliuered

by tradition and preaching, of which vnwritten
word the Scripture maketh mention
in many places,Thes. c. 2. 
                     •
                  . 14 & 1. ad Cor. 15. v. 
                     •
                  . ad Gal. 1. v. 8. 1. Petr. 1. v. vltimo. but we will first
treat of the written Word.
         
         
            CHAP. III.
            Of the written Word of God.
            THE written Word of God consisteth
of two parts, of the Letter
which euery▪ man may read in
the books themselues, and in the
true sēse of the Letter, which is as it were
the very soule and life thereof, without
which the Letter alone rather killeth thē
quickneth or giueth life: as we see euidently
by experience in the Iewes, Arians,
&c all other heretikes, as well new as old:
for the Iewes hold thēselues stiffely to the
Letter of the old Testamēt, & the Arians, as
also in a manner all other heretikes, receiue
eyther altogeather, or for the greatest
part the Letter of the new; but because
they will not acknowledge the true
sense of the Letter, Iewes they are Heretikes
they are, Catholikes they are not.
And surely the Letter alone without the
true sense cannot truly and properly be

called the Word of God, no more then
a body without a soule can truly and properly
be called a man: wherefore they
which spoile the Letter of the true sense
may be compared to them who bereaue a
man of his soule and life.
            2. But whosoeuer do substitute another
contrary sense and meaning in
place of the true, do no otherwise, then
they, who not only kill a man, but by
Art Magick bring into the body of the
man killed, some other diabolicall spirit,
by which the dead body is so moued,
and stirred, as it seemeth to many to bealiue:
all this is so manifest a truth, as our
Aduersaries themselues are not able to
deny it.
            3. This to haue byn the doctrine
of the auncient Church sufficiently appeareth
by the words of S. Augustine.August. serm. 78. de temp. 
               The
vnhappy Iewes, sayth he, & more vnhappy Heretikes,
whilst they attend only to the sound of the 
                  •
               etter,
as a body without a soule, so they remay
                  ••
               
dead, and voyd of the spirit which quickneth.
And els where:
               August'
                     •
                   Epist. 222
                     •
                  
                
               All
Heretickes which receiue
the Scriptures and their authority will seeme to follow
them▪ whereas indeed they follow rather their
owne errors, and are therefore Heretikes, not
because they co
                  •
               ntem
                  •
               e them, but because they do not
vnderstand them. And before him S. Hilary

               that honour of the French Nation. Remēber
(saith he) that there is not one of the heretikes
which doth not say that he preacheth now according
to the Scriptures,

                     〈◊〉
                  . euen those things in
which he blasphemeth, albeit he lieth in so saying▪
               And a little after: All of them speake Scriptures,
without the true sēce & meaning, they pretēd
sayth without fayth indeed, for the Scriptures
consist not so much in the reading as in the vnderstāding,
neyther are they vnderstood of such as go into
preuarication, but continue and abide in charity.

                     〈◊〉
                   Gal. Let vs not thinke (sayth
he) the Ghospell to be in the words of the Scripture
but in the sense, not in the out side, but in the inside, or
marrow, not in the leaues of the words, but in the
sappe,Matth. 4. v. 6. pith, or roote of reason. And a little after: otherwise
euen the Diuell himselfe speaketh. Scriptures,
and all heresies according to Ezechiel make
vnto themselues pillowes which they may lay vnder
the elbow of euery age.Ezech. 13. v. 
                     •
                  8.
            
            2. By that which hath byn sayd
answere may be made to our Aduersaries
when they obiect against vs, that we affirme
the Scripture to be imperfect, obseure,
like a nose of wax which a man
may writh which way he will, and lastly
the origen and spring in a manner of
all heresies: for we affirme this of the naked
and dead letter alone, destitute of the
true sense; or rather of the letter, to which

the Heretikes adde their owne peruerse
sense and meaning: neyther haue our Aduersaries
any cause to wonder at this, seeing
S. Paul himselfe saith of the bare letter
alone,1 Cor. 3. v. 6. 7. & 9. 
               that is killeth, and bringeth eternall
                     •
                   death
and damnation. But neuer any Catholike
did euer attribute any such thing to the
liuing letter, which hath conioyned
with it the true and natiue sense, and
which alone is truly and properly the
word of God.
         
         
            CHAP. IIII.
            How we are to seeke out the true sense
and meaning of the holy
Scripture.
            THERE is a great contentiō betweene
vs and our Aduersaries,
about the meanes how to finde
out the true and naturall interpretation
of the lett
                  •
               er,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                a thing to necessary
to eternall saluation. They teach, diuers
thinges concerning this matter, but
deliuer nothing that is certayne. One
assigneth more rules to this purpose, another

fewer, but when they haue sayd all,
they confesse at last that there was neuer
any which hath not at sometyme erred
in seeking out the true interpretation of
holy Scripture. For they giue not their
assent either to the ancient Fathers, or
to their owne Maisters in all thinges
they teach or write: nay they cannot assigne
any one whom they acknowledge
not to haue erred sometyme,Rom. 3. v. 4. nor dare affirme
to be free from error, seeing as they
say, euery man is a lyar: and so at last all
thinges are left by them doubtfull and
vncertayne.
            2. But the Catholikes proceed
after another manner, who teach, that the
certayne & vndoubted sense of the Letter
is not to be taken from the iudgment of
any particuler man, but from the vniforme
consent of the ancient Fathers,
and especially from the iudgment and interpretation
of the Catholike Church, to
whome it appertayneth to iudge of the
sense and meaning of the holy Scriptures,
as the holy and O
                     •
                  cumenicall Councell of Trēt
teacheth very well:Concil. Trent. s
                     •
                  ss. 4. for there is no doubt
but that it is nore safe to follow such an
interpreter as cannot erre, then such a
oners erreth sometymes, or at leastwise
may erre, but the Church cannot erre in

her iudgment,Matt. 28
                     •
                   c. vlc. seeing that Christ and the
holy Ghost remayne with her to teach
her all truth;Ioan. 14. 
                     •
                  . 
                     〈◊〉
                  . wherof more herafter when
we shall come to treat of the Church.
            3. It shall suffice to obserue and
note here,Ioan. 
                     •
                  6. v. 13. that according to the doctrine
of our Aduersaries nothing either solide
or certayne is contayned in the holy Scripture:
for wheras all dependeth of the
true sense of the Letter, and with them
there is no certayne or sure meanes by
which to finde out this sense, it followeth
that they call all into doubt, which is in
the Scripture, wherby who seeth not how
much they iniure them? But contrariwyse
according to the Catholike doctrine,
all thinges are euident and certayne
which are contayned in the holy
Scriptures, appertayning eyther to faith,
or good manners: the Catholikes hauing
euer a certayne and faithful Interpreter,
to wit, the Catholike Church.
And surely whosoeuer reiecteth the sense
which the Church giueth, and in place
therof substituteth another altogeather
repugnant to it, doth all one with him,
who reiecting the holy Scripture should
in place therof bring in a new Scripture
of his owne forging, the sense of the
Scripture being no lesse a part of the word

of God then the letter, which in these
few wordes Tertullian confirmeth out of
the tradition of the auncient Church:
The sense adultered,
               Tertul. de praesc. c. 17 
               or falsified, is no lesse repugnant
to the truth, then the letter, or stile corrupted.
            
            4. And to conclude, it may be inferred,
that saluation is to be found in the
Roman Church only,Mare. vlt. Vers. 16. and none at all out
of it,Ioan. 3. v. 18. which I proue thus. Both the Scripture
testifyeth & all mē confesse that diuine
fayth is necessary to saluation,Heb. 11. v. 
                     •
                  
                but
such as forsake the Romā Church, cannot
haue diuine 
                  •
               aith which wholy relieth
vpon the word of God only, but meerly
humane, seeing their fayth is founded
not in the word of God, interpreted by
the Church which cannot erre, but in
the word and interpretation of Luther, &
Caluin▪
                or some other priuate man, who as
they themselues graunt may erre, and be
deceiued; such an humane fayth then,
so doubtfull and vncertayne, and only
warranted by mans authority, cannot
iustify, or bring a man to eternall saluation.
         
         
            
            CHAP. V.
            How we may know which is the true
letter of the holy Scripture.
            ALL such as forsake the Roman
Church, and make little account
of her authority are not
only doubtfull & vndertayne,
which is the true sense of the Scripture,
but they can haue no assurance at all eyther
of the whole, or of any part of the
letter therof. For whilst they goe about
to call in question, and make doubtfull
certayne bookes only of the old Testament,
before they are aware they take
away all authority from all other bookes
both of the old and new Testament. For
whereas there is but one certaine and vndoubted
Canon of these bookes, to wit, that
which is receaued and appre
                  •
               ued by the
iudgment of the Catholike Church,
which cannot erre; our Aduersaries reiecting
this Canon, make all the bookes
doubtfull conteined therin▪ for no certayne
testimony can be had of these
bookes, but eyther by this Canon only,
or by the aunciēt tradition of the Church,

but they neyther admit this Canon, nor wil
stand to this vnwritten Traditiō, or acknowledge
it for the true Word of God.
            2. Now as for the Canons lately set
out by themselues, no man can safely belieue
them, seeing they neyther agree one
with another, nor with the auncient Canons
of the Church, nor are any where
found in the writtē Word of God, which
(as they teach) is only to be belieued:
neyther can they bring any thing, eyther
concerning the Canon of the Hebrewes, or
any other auncient Canon which they
haue not taken from the writings of the
auncient Fathers, whose authority without
the expresse written Word of God,
they will haue to be in no wise sufficient
to ingender fayth: so as euen by the iudgment
of our Aduersaries, none of all these
can establish fayth concerning this
matter.
            3. Iohn Caluin indeed sayth,Lib. 1. Inst. c. 7. sect 2. in fine. that it
is as easy for a faithfull man to discerne
Canonicall Scripture from that which
is not Canonicall, as to one that seeth
it is easy to discerne light from darknes,
and white from Black.See Bell. l. 1. de verb. Det c. 17. 18. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . But in so saying
he contradicteth both reason and experience,
for it is euident that in old tyme
there was no small controuersy amongst

the raythfull, yea and amongst learned
and godly men concerning many bookes
of the old and new Testament, yea and
also euen now amōgst such as our Aduersaries
esteeme faithfull men,Calu. pra
                  
                     •
                  at. in Epist. lacobi & āte Epist. ad Heb. & ante 2. S. Pe
                     •
                  ri. which Caluin
himselfe in many places confesseth▪
            
            4. Moreouer Caluins owne followers
well perceauing this, fly vnto their owne
peculiar spirit, by which they say they are
chiefly perswaded and moued, and not by
the only consent of the Church. But
these speake nothing to the purpose, for
in faith two thinges concurre,Rupell. cō
                  fess. art. 4. one is the
cause or origen of fayth, to wit God
himselfe, and the holy Ghost, whereof
there is no controuersy betweene vs and
them, for we all acknowledge the holy
Ghost to be the principall cause of the assent
we giue by fayth, that is to say, that
it is the holy Ghost who chiefly perswadeth
vs to belieue. The other is the obiect
of fayth, or that which is to be belieued,
whereof we now dispute, for the holy
Ghost doth not induce vs to belieue the
false & vncertaine deuises of men, but the
pure and sincere Word of God only: we
aske therfore of our Aduersaries, by what
expresse Word of God he reuealeth vnto
them, that there are so many Canonicall
bookes, and neyther fewer nor more; for

we read not this any where in the Scripture,
and they admit only the written
Word of God, how can the holy Ghost
then perswade thē 
               
                  •
               o belieue that which
is not the Word of God?Calu. l. 1. Instit. c. 9. sect. 1. for we are not
now to expect new 
                  ••
               uelations from
God, as do the 
                  
                     •
                  nabaptists and Libertines,
whom for this cause our Aduersaries condemne.
It is necessary therefore that if
they will haue vs belieue, that they are
perswaded by the holy Ghost to belieue
such books only to be authenticall as they
doe say are such; that they first shew this
to be a truth expressely contayned in holy
Scripture, which they will neuer be able
to do: wherfore there is no certainty
with them eyther of the sense of the holy
Scripture,Innocēt. 1. ep. 3. c. vlt. Cōcil. 3. or of the Letter, nor euer wilbe
vntill they returne vnto the Church agayne.Carthag. can. 47. S. Aug. Epist. 235. Cōcil.
But we Catholikes are certaine of
both, for we haue a most faythfull Canon
receaued in the Church more thē a thousand
and two hundred yeares agoe, confirmed
by a generall,Tridents. sess. 4. and Oecumenicall
Councell.
            5. And this to haue beene the faith
and doctrine of the auncient Church for
the discerning of true and authenticall
Scriptures,Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14. sect. vlt. that short but pithy sentence
of S. Augustins (whome Caluin acknowledgeth

the Church. And else-where he saith:

            6. I know our Aduersaries obiect
many thinges against many bookes contayned
in our Ecclesiasticall Canon, but
their chiefe arguments do not only derogate
authority from those bookes, but also
from many others, which they receaue
as Canonicall. For they obiect that
some Fathers did sometymes doubt of
those bookes which they will not admit,
but they are not ignorant that some Fathers
of old haue doubted of the Epistles
of S. Iames, and S. Iude of the second Epistle
of S. Peter, of the 2. and 3. of S. Iohn,
of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, and of the
Apocalyps, of which bookes they dare
not now doubt,Rup

as is manifest by their confession
of faith.
            7. They say further, that in those
bookes which they reiect, there are many

thinges obscure, difficult, and full of
contradiction, but what booke of Scripture
in a manner is there in the which
there do not occurre sometymes thinges
obscure and hard to be vnderstood?2. Petr. 3. v. 26. did
not S. Peter acknowledge as much? But
as for true contradictions there are none
at al howsoeuer there may be some things
which at the first fight may seeme to imply
contradiction, yet indeed all thinges
agree very well togeather: such a contradiction
is oftentymes found in those
bookes, which euen our Aduersaries receaue,
yea euen in the Ghospells themselues,Aug. de Doct.
which for all that are not to be reiected,Christian. l. 2. c. 41. & deserm. Domini in monte l. 1. c. 3.

                  nterpreted, as S. Augustine many tymes
admonisheth.
            8. To conclude, all the arguments
that our Aduersaries make against these
bookes are fully answered by Catholike
writers, which haue set out Commentaries

Iansenius vpon Ecclesiasticus,

to omit the most Reuerend and famous Cardinall
Bellarmine, and his Champion Iacobus Gretserus▪
                  
as also Iames Gordon Lesmoreus. For it is sufficient
only to haue cited them, seeing
that I write only an abridgment of Controuersies,
& not any long commentaries
vpon the Scripture. And therfore contēt
my selfe to haue shewed in this place that
our Aduersaries must either receaue the
Canon of Scriptures approued by the
Councell of Trent, or be vtterly destitute
of any certayne and assured Canon.
         
         
            CHAP. VI.
            Of the Hebrew Text.
            OVR Aduersaries when they are
vrged with Catholike argumēts
taken from the Scriptures, are
wont to fly to the Hebrew text
of the old Testament, and to the Greeke
text of the new, perswading themselues
by this meanes to attayne to the true and
proper sense of the letter: wherefore somthing
is to be sayd in this place of the
Hebrew & Greeke text, both which appertayne
to the Letter of the holy Scripture.
            2. VVe grant indeed, that when the

Latin translation is either ambiguous o
                  •
               
lesse playne, the Hebrew text is well and
profitably looked into, as also that diuers
myst
                  •
               ries which lye hidden in the Hebrew
text and cannot sufficiently be explicated
in Latin wordes, may be the better vnderstood.
And lastly that we may the
more fully attayne vnto the force and
Emphasis of that holy tongue.
            3. But as for the Hebrew text now extant,
we do not acknowledge it to be of
so great either authority, or perspicuity
as our Aduersaries pretend, and we further
deny that the vulgar Editiō wherinsoeuer
it differeth from it, is to be corrected
by it, and that for two reasons.
The first is, for that the Hebrew text
though neuer so incorrupt, further then
it is approued by the authority of the
Church, is much more doubtfull, and
vncertayne then the Latin. The other
reason is, for that the Hebrew text which
is now in vse is in many places corrupted
and depraued, in which the vulgar Edition
is entire and vncorrupted. Both
these reasons shalbe confirmed in the ensuing

                  •
               hapters, which the learned Reader
may see in the Latin edition, from
the seauenth Chapter to the 14. all which
I haue omitted to put into English, because

I intend to help the lesse learned,
who are not so capable of that so profoūd
and learned a discourse.
         
         
            CHAP. VII.
            Of our Aduersaries new Translations of
the Bible.
            THE Catholike Church of Christ
not without good cause doth reiect
and condemne our Aduersaries
new Translations of the
Bible, and that for many reasons. The
first and most iust reason is, because such
their translations are replenished with
errors, which haue byn inuented eyther
by Iewes, or Heretikes, of which see many examples
in the precedent Chapters of the
Latin edition; but we in this Chapter
will set downe three other causes or origens
from whence these errors spring,
wherby it shall further appeare, that our
Aduersaries can set out no trans
                  •
               ation
which shall not be found full of many &
great errors.
            2. The first cause is, for that our Ad
               
                  •
               ersaries
eyther contemne, or make little

account of the translations and interpretations
of the Fathers, and imploy all
their labour in finding out all the versions,
and interpretations, and expositions
of the Iewes, which they highly extoll &
commend: so as in their Commentaries
vpon the old Testament, you shall see
them cite Thargus Rabins, and such other
Thalmudicall fictions, but especially Rabbi
Dauid Kim
                     •
                  i, whom sometimes they call
learned, sometymes the most learned among
the Hebrewes. But of the auncient Fathers
no mention at all, for if there be, it is for
the most part, eyther to taxe, or manifestly
to oppugne, or euen to corrupt their
writings.
            3. Now what can be more vnreasonable
or absurd, then to begge the true
sense of the Scripture of the Iewes,
               2. Cor. 3. v. 1
                     •
                  . & 1. Thessal. c. 2. v. 15. 1
                     •
                  . who
lacke faith, and who haue a veyle ouer their
hartes, when they read the old Testament,
with whome God is not pleased, and
who are Aduersaries to all men, vpon
whom the Angel of God is come to the
end, who peruert all the oracles of the
Prophets that appertayne to Christ; and
lastly, who are the most malicious enemies
of Christians. And on the other side to
despise the excellent Doctors of Christs
Church, who euen in the iudgment of

our Aduersaries were indued with the
true faith,Rom. 8. v. 9. Ephes. 4. v. 14. full of the holy Ghost, raysed
by God, and placed in the Church, to the
end we should not be carried about with
euery wind of doctrine, who haue defended
the faith against all heresies, who
haue sincerely instructed the faithfull
people in the mysteries of the Christian
faith, who haue faithfully sent downe
to posterity the sense and interpretation
of the Scriptures which they receaued frō
the Apostles.
            4. Moreouer, wheras no man can
rightly interprete the Scriptures who
hath not receaued from God the gift of
the interpretation,2. Cor. 121 v. 10. 28. 2. Petri 1. v. 20. 21. which is not giuen
but to the members of Christ, and his
Church only, it is apparent inough how
much more safe it is to follow such holy
Doctors, then the impiou
                  •
                
               Iewes which
are wrapt in the snares of the Diuell,
               2. Timoth. 2. v. vlt. 
               and held
captiue at his will. And seeing that saying
of Christ is most true,Matth. 15. v. 14. 
               if the blind lead the
blind, they both fall into the ditch; it cannot be
but our Aduersaries, blind and destitute of
the light of faith, and led by the blind
Iewes, must needes fall downe headlong,
and breake their neckes.
            5. Here
                  •
               hence it is, that our Aduersaries
do insert into the new translations

almost all the places of Scripture
corrupted by the Iewes, and that they deny
togeather with the Iewes many oracles of
the Prophets, to be vnderstood of Christ,
and many wayes wrest euen those oracles
which they cānot deny to be vnderstood
of Christ, from that true sense in which
they are cited in the new Testament, by
the Apostles, Euangelists, and Christ
himselfe, to prophane & impious senses
lately inuented by the Iewes out of their
hatred to Christ.
            6. The second cause is, that they desire
nothing more then in their translations
to depart from the vulgar edition,
the which seeing it is most sincere and
correct, they which almost in all thinges
leaue it, must needes fall into many
errors.
            7. The third cause is, the malicious
intention of our Aduersaries, who set
forth new translations of the Scripture
for no other end, then by them to oppugne
the Catholike doctrine, and to establish
and confirme their owne errors
and heresies: and therefore when any
plain text occurreth, which maketh manifestly
against their erroneous doctrine,
they seeke to make obscure the true and
proper sense by their peruerse translation;

but if they light vpon any place somewhat
obscure, which may seeme to fauour
their doctrine, they so depraue it by
their new translation, that the Scripture
it selfe may seeme to confirme what they
falsely teach, and so by this meanes they
must needes stuffe their translations with
infinite corruptions, for these three reasons:Grets. tractat. denouis trā
                  slation. in defen. Bellarm.
therfore not without great reason
do we reiect our Aduersaries transla
                  •
               ions
which so swarme with corruptions. Many
other reasons are both learnedly and
largely set downe by Iames Gretser, which
we for breuity sake omit.
         
         
            CHAP. VIII.
            Of the Latin vulgar Edition.
            OVR Aduersaries conuinced by
the truth it selfe, confesse sometymes,
that the vulgar Edition
not only is to be preferred before
all other latin Editions, but euen before
the Greeke text of the new Testament, and
the Hebrew text of the old, for in many
places reiecting them, they follow our
vulgar translation, as may be seene in the
Latin edition in the Chapters 8. 9. 10. 13.

notwithstanding that in many other
places they exceedingly inueigh against
it, and with great hostility oppugne it,
partly for that they see the same to contradict
in many places their errors, and
partly also, for that they labour by all
meanes to perruert the text of the Scripture
by their new versions, to make
thē speake in fauour of their errors, which
they cannot do if the authority of the old
interpreter continue in all thinges entire
and vndiminished.Caluin in Antidoto contra 4
                     •
                   sess Concil. Tridentini As for Caluin, he is so
deadly an enemy to the vulgar edition,
that with great excesse he declameth against
it in this manner: So farre off is it,
saith he, that there is one entire leafe, as there are
scarse three verses togeather not defiled with some
notable error. But to proue this his impudent
assertion, he bringeth only one place
out of the new Testament, which a little
after we will shew to haue byn exceedingly
well translated out of the Greeke.
He bringeth no other places out of the
old Testament then such as he taketh out
of the Psalmes, which (as it is euident)
are translated word for word out of the
Greeke version of the Septuagint interpreters.
Nay in the same place, Caluin acknowledgeth
that the Latin interpreter hath,
with all possible diligence, expressed

the Greeke translatiō. And as for the Greeke
interpretation of the Septuaginta, it is most
learnedly defended by Genebrard,
               Geneb. i
                     •
                   Psal 
                     •
                  
                so as it
were superfluous to say any more. Indeed
Caluins & Luthers disciples find fault with
many other places in the vulgar edition,
both of the old and new Testament, but
we will lay foure generall grounds, out
of which all their arguments may be easily
answered.
            2. The first is: If our Aduersaries
will needes haue the present Roma
                     •
                  
               
Church condemned for following and
authorizing the vulgar Latin interpretation,
they must needes also condemne
the whole auncient Church, and all the
Fathers who liued in the first foure hundred
yeares after Christ, for they acknowledged
no other interpretation of the old
Testament as authenticall, then that
of the Septuaginta Interpreters, which
much more departeth from the Hebrew
text, now extant, then our vulgar Latin,
as our Aduersaries themselues confesse.
Wherfore if the Roman Church be to be condemned
for the vulgar Edition, much
more the Primitiue Church for the version
of the Septuaginta: and heereof it followeth
further, that the Church is not to be
condemned which followeth a translation

of the Scripture which in some
thinges may be amended, so long as nothing
is to be found in it which is repugnant
eyther to fayth or good manners:
For otherwise the auncient Church had
erred in retayning the version of the
Septuaginta, which was corrupted in some
places, but those corruptions were not in
any thing necessary to be knowne.Calu. l. 4, Instit c. 1. sect▪ 12. Moreouer
Caluin himselfe con
                  •
               esteth, that we must
not depart from the Church, for errors of little importance,
the ignorance whereof neyther doth violate
Religion, nor preiudice our saluation. Wherfore
albeit there should be some such errors
in the vulgar Edition, yet were not
the Roman Church,
               Rom. 
                     •
                  . v. 8. Hiero
                     ••
                  . Epist. 57. 
                     •
                  d Dam. which is so auncient &
so hightly commended by the mouth of
the Apostle (as speaketh S. Hierome) to be condemned
or forsaken. And this may serue
for answere to our Aduersaries arguments,
when they obiect certayne light
faults of the vulgar Edition which haue
crept into it, eyther by the negligence of
the printers, or by any other accident.
As also what our Aduersaries obiect against
the Psalter may heerby be conuinced
to be very weake, for seeing that no
other version is followed in it, then that
auncient version of the Septuaginta, they
cannot condemne vs, vnlesse they will

condemne the whole primitiue Church,
togeather with vs, yea the Apostles and Euangelists
thēselues, who followed the same
version, is as shewed in the 11. Chapter
of the Latin Edition of this Controuersy.
            3. The second ground. A good interpreter
doth not ty himselfe to transtate
word for word, seeing that euery tongue
hath his proper phrases, and manner of
speach, but contenteth himselfe to expresse
the true sense and meaning of that
which he translateth. Wherefore all our
Aduersaries argumēts are nothing worth
by which they proue that certayne places
of the vulgar edition are somewhat otherwise
in the Hebrew and Greeke, so that
the sense of the whole period be one and
the same, as most of the places are which
they carpe at in the vulgar Edition.
            4. The third ground. The places of
holy Scripture are of two sortes, some are
cleare & manifest, as almost all are, which
set downe the history of the old and new
Testament. Others are obscure, and full
of difficulty, as are many places in the
Psalmes and Prophets. Now if the interpreter
in such places as are euident and manifest,
do interprete rightly all of them,

                  •
               nd in such places of Scripture as are obscure,

expresse a sense and meaning agreab
                  •
               e
to the Letter, though he come short
of the best sense, and that there might be
a better gi
                  •
               en, he is not therefore to be
thought to haue erred, or not to haue fulfilled
the office of a good interpreter. For
so plentifull and profound is the sense
of holy Scripture, especially in such places
as are ob
                  •
               cure, as it is not easy for any
man to 
                  •
               udge, which is the best sense.
Nay if we must interprete a new, vntill
wee haue found out the best sense, there
will neuer be a
                  •
                end of interpreting, but
we must euery yeare set forth a new inter

               tation,
or at least correct and amend
the 
                  •
               ormer, as our Aduersaries haue done,
and Bezw by name, who hauing set out
fiue diuers editions of the new Testament
euery one much differing from the other,
                  
                     〈…〉
                   1598.
as himselfe freely confesteth, yet he plainly
acknowledgeth that in his first edition
he hath neyther satisfyed eyther the greatnes
of the worke, or his owne desire. Out
of which ground we answere to that
which our Aduersaries obiect: to wit,
that there are many places of the vulgar
Edition which might much better and
much more cleerly haue been translate
                  •
               :
for it is sufficient that they are well and
rightly translated.
            
               
5. The fourth ground. We are not
to reprehend the translations of holy Scripture,
only because they differ one from
another, so long as they are not contrary
the one to the other: and in this the holy
Scripture differeth from other prophane
writings. For euen as the holy Ghost in
diuers places of holy Scripture teacheth
thinges different, but not repugnant: so
the same holy Ghost can in one place
& in the same words teach diuers things.
And heerehence it is,1. p. q. 1
                     •
                   art. vlt. that S. Thomas teacheth
well, as did S. Augustine before him,
that of one & the same p
                  •
               ace of Scripture,
there may be many litterall senses. For
whereas the litterall sense is that which
the author intendeth, and the proper and
chiefe author of the holy Scripture is God
himselfe whose intention and meaning is
not tied to one verity only, as is mans vnderstanding,
but he in one and the same
moment comprehendeth all things; there
is no doubt, but that he in the same words
and at the same tyme, can intimate vnto
vs diuers things.
            6. The which thing is excellently
declared by S. Augustin,
               Aug. l. 12. confess. cap. vltimo. for hauing said that
he thought Moyses intended diuers senses
in his words, he correcteth himselfe saying,
that without all doubt God who is

the principall author of the Scriptures
did so. O

seeing there

may follow one sense, and another

                another, so long as neyther
of them do say any thing not agreeable
to the word of God, but both the
one sense and the other is godly, and
conformable to other places of Scripture:
and this maketh much for the dignity of
the Scriptures, and profit of the Church,
according to that which S. Augustin writeth
elsewhere:Lib. 3. de Doct. Christ. c. 27.

Scripture it selfe to shew very manifestly,
that there are diuers senses of the same
wordes. For there is no doubt, but that

               ignifications,
as hath beene shewed in the seauēth
Chapter in the Latin Edition.
            8. Out of this ground we affirme,
that there is no repugnance betweene the
Septuagint Interprters, and the Hebrew
text, and betweene the Hebrew text and
the vulgar Edition, or lastly betweene the
interpretation of the vulgar Edition of the
old Testament, and that of the new, how
much soeuer the same wordes are diuersly
translated, to wit, otherwise of the S
                     •
                  ptuagint,
and otherwise of the vulgar Latine
interpreter, or otherwise of the vulgar Edition
of the old Testament, and otherwise
of the vulgar Edition of the new, where in
both places the same wordes are cited, for
the same places of Scripture are oftentymes
otherwise cited by the Apostles in the

               new Testament, then hath the Hebrew text of
of the old. But here is diuersity without
any repugnance, or contrariety. And this
hath place especially in the Hebrew text,
because in the Hebrew tongue there is so
different reading of one and the same
word. See examples hereof in the Latine
Edition of this Controuersy, in this
Chapter.
            9. It wilbe easy out of that which
hath byn said to answere that which our
Aduersaries obiect against diuers places
of the vulgar edition. For albeit there
be diuersity betweene it, and the Hebrew
text, there is no repugnance or
contrari
                  •
               ty: and if our Aduersaries think
otherwise it proceedeth from their ignorance
of the Hebrew tongue, which hath
many wordes subiect to ambiguity, and
very many phrases much different from
the Latin and Greeke phrase, as in the
Chapters that follow may be seene in the
Latin Edition from the 16. to the 20.
         
         
            
            CHAP. IX.
            The place of Genesis (she shall breake thy
head) is shewed to be well translated.
            IT wilbe too long, and little to my
purpose to examine all the places of
the vulgar Edition to which our
Aduersaries take exception, for
many of them differ little or nothing
from the Hebrew text of the old Testament,
or from the Greeke of new: we
will handle some few of greatest difficulty,
and which our Aduersaries do
most often and with great bitternes vrge
against vs, that by them, iudgment may
be giuen of the rest which are of lesse importance.
            2. The first place which they say
is depraued, and or which they often and
eagerly complaine,Lutherus & Lutherani in Genes. ib. is that of the third of
Genesis v. 15. Ipsa conteret caput tuum: for
it is not ipsa in the Hebrew, but ipsum. as
if it were spoken of the seed of the womā
and not of the woman her selfe. The Lutherans
crie out of great iniury done
thereby to Christ, as to whome alone it
appertayneth to bruze the head of the

Diuel which we attribute to another, to
wit, to the Blessed Virgin.
            
            3. Caluin also affirmeth, that we
haue found out a sacrilegious exposition,
whilst we accommodate that to the holy
Mother of Christ which was spoken of
the seed,Calu. in c. 
                     •
                  . Gen. v. 1
                     •
                  . Christ himselfe. And as for the
Lutherans we haue lesse cause to blame thē
for reprehending our version, seeing they
stoutly mantayne, that by the seed of
the woman Christ only is meant.
            4. But as for Caluin, he sheweth
the greedy appetite he hath to calumniate
whē he calleth our version a sacrilegious exposition,
for he conuinced by the truth, cō
               fesseth
that by the seed of the woman not
only Christ is meant, but all his member
                  •
               
yea euen all mankind. It is therefore wō
               derfull
that he saith, it is a sacrilegious exposition,
to apply to the Blessed Virgin Mary
that which was spoken of the seed, vnlesse
he will not that the Blessed Virgin
be any mēber of Christ, or to appertayn
                  •
               
any thing to mankind. For seeing that
the promise of bruzing Sathās head appertayneth
to Chris
                  •
               , and euery member of
his (as Caluin writeth in expresse wordes)
it must doubtlesse principally appertayne
to the Blessed Virgin,Calu. l. 1. Inst. c. 14▪ sect. 18. as who next after
Christ, hath most strongly crushed Satans

head.Hunnius in Caluino Iudaizāte, & in 
                     ••
                  nti-pareo. VVherfore euen the Lutherans
themselues obserue, that Caluin ha
                  •
               h no
reason to obiect this vnto the Catholikes.
            5. But to the end we may the better
vnderstand whether it be any fault at all,
that we retayne in the vulgar version the
particle (ipsa) we are first to declare the
literall sense of this place, and to examine
after, whether it be any error that we retayne
the particle (ipsa) in our version.
For it was not out of any ignorance or
drowsy carelesnes, that the feminine gender
crept in heere, insteed of the masculine, or
neuter,
               In Genes. loco citato as Caluin calumniateth, but it was
done of purpose, and for iust cause, as shalbe
shewed.
         
         
            CHAP. X.
            Of the true sense of these wordes: Ipsa
conteret &c.
            THAT we may find out the true
sense of these wordes, we must
first re
                  •
               ute the f
                  •
               lse expositions
of our Aduersaries. The Lutherās
by the seed of the womā will needes haue
Christ only to be mean
                  •
               : we confesse indeed

that he is principally meant therby,
and that therefore the place may be well
vnderstood of Christ, as many auncient
Fathers haue expounded it, but that
Christ alone is meant hereby, and not his
members we deny to be the literall sense
for the reasons following.
            2. First it is euident that the seed
of the Serpent which is opposed against
the seed of the woman, doth not signify
any one Serpent, but a multitude: it is
therefore very probable, that by the seed
of the woman a multitude also is signified,
vnlesse we will haue the Scripture
in so few wordes speak ambiguously.
Moreouer semen is a Nowne collectiue
properly signifying a multitude, neyther
is there any thing in this sentence that
forceth vs to departe from the proper signification
of the Word. This reason is
of so great a force, that C
                     •
                  luin was moued
therby to forsake the exposition of
the Lutherans, which he would otherwise
willingly haue imbraced the more
strongly to assault vs, for thus he writeth:
Some make no doubt but Christ alone is
meant by the seed of the woman, whose exposition
I could willingly approue,
               Calu. in Gen. loco citato. 
               but that I see they offer
too great violence to the word (seed) for who will
graunt, that a Nowne collectiue is to be taken for

one man only? Thus Caluin. So strong is the
truth, that it extorteth a true confession
from her greatest enemy.
            3. Secondly it is said of the seed of
the woman, that it shall crush, and bruze
the head of the Serpent, but this crushing
and bruzing the Scripture doth not attribute
to Christ alone, but to all that lead
a godly life in him, for to euery iust man
the holy Ghost speaketh, saying: thou
shalt walke ouer the Addar and Basiliske,
               Psal. 90▪ v 13. 
               and thou
shalt tread vnder thy seete the Lyon and the Dragon.
And Christ saith vnto his Disciples:
Behold I haue giuen you power to tread vpon the
Serpents and Scorpions,
               Luc. 10. v. 19. 
               and vpon all the power of
the enemy. And the Apostle to the Romans
prayeth saying. The God of peace crush
Satan vnder your feete quickly. And lastly in
very many places of Scripture the faithfull
are said to ouer come the Diuell,Rom. 16. v. 20. and to
get victories against him, which is all
one as to crush him. Seing therefore the
proper worke of this seed agreeth also
to the members of Christ,1. Ioan. 2. v 13. the Word
seed is not to be limited to Christ alone.Apoc. 12. v. 11.
Ad hereunto that God in these wordes
intended to comfort not only Eue deceaued
by the craft of the Diuell,1. Cor. 15. v. 57. but all her
posterity. Now the comfort is more generall,
if all the faithfull should be able

by Christ to ouercome the Diuell, then if
that Christ alone should ouercome him,
euen as our comfort is greater that we togeather
with Christ shall rise againe, then
if Christ only should rise, and he alone
attayne to eternall life.
            4. Thirdly. Albeit we should graunt
our Aduersaries, that Christ alone doth
crush the head of the Diuell, which is
the former part of the sentence: yet the
latter part can by no meanes be applyed
to Christ alone, where it is sayd, that the
Diuell shall crush this seed, for Christ in
his owne person cannot be crushed by
the Diuell: we must therefore needes by
this seed vnderstand also the members of
Christ, for in the Hebrew text it is thus
word for word, ipsa, velipsum, cōteret te in capite,
& tu contere
                     •
                   cum, vel eam, in calcaneo, for
the Hebrew word is the same in both places
both in the first and in the later part of
the sentence, and signifyeth c
                     •
                  nterere.
            
            5. As for Caluins exposition interpreting
by the seed of the woman all man
kind;In Gen. Ioco citato & l. 2. it is not to be receaued, for God in
this place denounceth emnity betweene
the seed of the Serpent,
               Instit. c. 
                     •
                  3. sect. 2. and the seed of the
woman, but infidells and vngoodly persons
haue no emnity with the Diuell, and
his seed, but are rather the seed and sonnes

of the Diuell, according to those words
of Christ:Ioan. 8. v. 44. 
               You are of your father the Diuell; they
therefore cannot appertayne to this seed
of the woman.
            6. But whereas Caluin in another
place sayth,Caluin l. 1. Instit. c. 14. sect. 18. that Christ and his members
are signifyed by the seed of the woman, wee
like well of that his saying, for it is the
exposition of the Catholike and auncient
Fathers, and indeed the true litterall
sense.
            7. For in that sentence God sayth,
first that he will put emnity, wherefore
he speaketh not of any naturall emnity, as
Caluin insinuateth, but of a supernaturall proceeding
from God. Moreouer God signifyeth
betweene whome this emnity shalbe,
to wit, betweene the Serpent and woman.
Now as by the Serpent the Diuell is meant,
whome that naturall Serpent represented,
and in whome God layed his curse vpon
the Diuell: so by the woman Eue, is meant
the spouse of Christ, or his true Church represented
by Eue, whose force and victory
against the Diuell was therefore foretold
by God:Ephes. 5. v. 32. 2. Cor. 11. v. 2. & 3. for that Eue represented the
Church, as Adam did Christ, the Apostle
plainely teacheth in his Epistle to the Ephes.
and the same Apostle doth therfore elsewhere
expound this place of Satan, and

the Church,
               Apoc. 
                     •
                  . v. 13. 17. as doth S. Iohn in his Apocalyps
where he declareth this emnity betwene
the woman and the Serpent, to be indeed
the emnity betweene the Church of Christ
and the Diuell: wherfore here by the Serpent
is signifyed the Diuell by the woman the
Church, by the seed of the Serpent the Children
of the Diuell, and all the wicked who
are aliens from Christ and his Church,
but especially such as seduce others and
oppugne the Church.Matt. 13. v. 38. The seede of the
woman are the Children of the Church,Apocal. 12. v. 17.
especially such as keep Gods commaundments,
and haue the testimony of Iesus Christ,
as S. Iohn speaketh.
            8. Furthermore, this woman, to wit
the Church shall crush the head of the Serpent,
               Psal. 90. v. 13. Luc. 10. v. 19. Rom. 16. v. 20.
as we haue proued by many places of
Scripture. But on the other side the womans
heele shalbe crushed by Satan, for the
Church ouercōmeth the Diuell by her
chiefe and more excellent members, but
she is ouercome in such her members as
are base and worldly giuen, which set
vp their rest heere vpon earth, and tast
no other things but such as are terrene &
earthly,Defuga. saeculi c. 7. worthily therefore signified by
the heele of the Church; let vs not therefore,
sayth S. Ambrose, walke by loue and affection vpont he
earth, and the Serpent cannot hurt vs.
               
In the first combat is that the Church ouer
cometh by open warre, and therefore
it is expressed by crushing of the head. In
the later combat in which a part of the
Church is ouercome, the enemy proceedeth
by guiles and deceites, and therefore
that combat is signifyed by crushing the
heele, for the Hebrew word signifying calcaneum,
               Oleoster in c. 3. Gen.
doth signify also properly insiaiari,
& ex insidijs aggredi, as appeareth by many
places of Scripture. And out of ignorance
heerof Caluin without cause reprehendeth
the vulgar interpreter, for otherwise explicating
this combat in the later part of
the sētence then he had in the former, for
the Emphasis, or force of the Hebrew word
required that he should interprete the later
part as he did by these wordes, tu insidiaberis
calcaneo eius, which is as much to
say, as thou shalt crush her heele, not by
open warre, but by taking her at vnawares.
See further of this matter in this
Chapter in the Latin Edition the 8. §.
And you shall see that our Aduersaries
make a great adoe about a matter of small
moment, if the wordes be rightly vnderstood.
For whether we reade ipsa, and so
referre it to the Church, or ipsum, that it
may be referred to the children of the
Church, the sēse is all one, for it is all on to

say, the seed of the woman shall crush the head
of the Serpent, or the Children of the Church
shall doe it. And heerehence it i
                  •
               , that the
auncient Fathers, whether they read ipse,
as S. Hierome,
               Hier. in tradit. and S. Chrysostome do, or ipsa,
as read S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Gregory,
               Hebraicis. Homil. 17. in Gen.
and other Latin Fathers, all of them expound
this place of the Church.
            9. Howsoeuer it be,Amb. de fuga saeculi c. 7. the reading of
the vulgar Edition is to be preferred before
the other, for this victory is rather
to be attributed to the Church,Greg. in Iob. c. 38. as to the
Mother of all the faithfull, and to her
who continueth for euer, according to
that promise of Christ, the gates of hell shall
not preuaile against her, then to her children
or mēbers, which are euery day changed,
for this promise is an explication of the
promise made by God in Genesis, for the
head of the Serpent, and the gates of hell signify
one and the same thing.Matt. 1
                     •
                  . v. 18. And if the victory
be attributed to the woman, that is, to
the Church, all thinges are better explicated,
for God first did foretell the emnity
that was to be betweene the woman & the
Serpent, and afterward he maketh mention
of the seede of the woman, and the Serpents
seede, so as the woman is opposed to the Serpent,
and the seede of the one to the seede of
the other; but the victory pro
                  ••
               sed, is

sayd to be gotten against the Serpent himselfe,
and not against the seed: wherefore
the same appertaineth rather to the woman
her selfe then to her seed, for the words following
(betweene thy seed and her seed) do
not properly signify any new combat,
but a continuance of that combat which
was betweene the woman and the Serpent,
and are put in by way of parēthesis, for the
combat of the Church and of her childrē
is all one combat.
            10. But the chiefe cause that moued
the Church to retayne at this tyme rather
the word ipsa, then ipsum, or ipse, was to
controle the error of the Lutherans, for if
the reading had byn ipsum, or ipse, one
might haue thought this promise to haue
appertayned only to Christ, as they
(though erroneously) would haue it,
but by reading ipsa, this promise must
needes be vnderstood to haue byn made
to the whole Church. For such is the
custome of the holy Church, whether she
interprete the Scripturs or administer the
Sacraments to do all as is most profitable
and most for the edification of the faithfull.
Neyther is Christ hereby excluded
but he is rather included in the name of
the Church, as is also the holy Ghost, for
the true Church of Christ cannot consist

or do anything that is good without the
help of her supreme head Christ and the
assistance of his holy spirit. That the reading
according to the Hebrew text i
                  •
               
               ipsa, or ipsissima, and not ipsum, or ipse is learnedly
proued in the next Chapter of the
Latin Edition of this Controuersy, to
which I referre the Reader, and to the
Chapters following, in which other
places of the vulgar Edition are defended.

Controuersies, concerning matters

            OVR Aduersaries in the beginning
did stifly mayntaine that
the holy Scripture was to be the
only iudge of all Controuersies
which arise in matters of fayth, but
when they were told, that to make the
Scripture a iudge was as much as to say,
the Scripture did heare, speake, & liue, for
all these appertayne to a iudge, & that nothing
is more vnreasonable thē to assigne
such a iudge of Controuersies, as can neyther
heare, nor speake, but is vtterly voyd

now to 
                  •
               ay that the Scripture is improperly
called a iudge,Cont. 1. l. 3. c. 3. nota 9. &c. 9. nota 8. & 10. and that to speake
properly, the holy Ghost only is the
iudge. And thus hauing for many
yeares togeather spoken vnproperly, now
a
                  •
                last they fly to the holy Ghost, of
whome there is no doubt,Robertus Rolocc. de vocation

                   effic. c. 15. but that he is
the supreme iudge of all.
            2. But they should haue added further
that the holy Ghost at this tyme
doth not immediatly propose any new
reuelations to any particuler man concerning
points of fayth, but only proposeth

the mouth of the Church, as shalbe shewed

we shall haue occasion to say more of this
matter. Whosoeuer therefore contemneth
the iudgment of the Church, in so doing,
he despiseth the iudgment of Christ, and of
the holy Ghost, for Christ himselfe saith,
he that despyseth you, despyseth me. Neyther
doth the holy Ghost speake by the Scripture
but when it is rightly vnderstood,Luc. 10. v. 16.
which is neuer but when we imbrace the
interpretation of the Catholike Church,
as we haue already shewed in the fourth
Chapter.

            THE Word of God is eyther

Now certaine it is, that
the Word preached is not obscure,
for it is not hidden from such as perish: the
question thefore is of the written Word.

                  . Cor. 4. v. 3.
Our Aduersaries in the beginning did
teach that the whole Scripture was easy,
and no part therof hard to be vnderstood,
but after that not only many obscure
places, but euen whole Chapters out of the
Canticle of Canticles, out of Izechiel, and
other Prophets were obiected by the Catholikes,Beza de notis Eccl. Volu. 3. p. 137. edit. ann. 1582.
they changing their mind confesse
that very many places of Scripture
are obscure, but that all points of doctrine
necessary to saluation, are be 
                  •
               ound in
places plains and easy,
            2. For resolution of this question,
we must answere with a distinction, and
say, that if the word Scripture be taken for
the bare Letter only, then doubtlesse the
Scripture is obscure,
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. 3. v. 6. 7. 9. or els S. Paul would
not have sayd, that it killeth and causeth death
and damnation; but if it be taken properly,

that is to say, togeather with the true sense
and meaning thereof, then it is not obscure
but plaine inough in al things necessary
to saluation, and in this sense speaketh
S. Augustine,
               l. 3. de doct. Christiana c. 7. & 9▪
                as do also other Fathers
whom our Aduersaries cite whē they say,
that al things necessary to saluatiō are manifestly
conteyned in the holy Scripture.
            3. Moreouer the holy Scripture is
both manifest, and obscure, but not in regard
of the same persons. It is passing obscure
and not to be vnderstood of the proud, such
I meane, as despise the sense and consent
of the holy Fathers, yea and of the whole
Catholike Church, but to little ones and
such as are humble who follow in al things
the foresayd sense & cōsent,Psal. 18. v. 8. it is manifest
and perspicuous. The testimony of our Lord
is faythfull (sayth the Psalmist) giuing wisedome
to the little ones, that is, to such as are
humble and not proud: and Christ our
Lord sayth,Matth. 11. v. 25. 
               thou hast hidden these thinges from
the wise, and reuealed them to little ones, that is
to the humble. The Scripture indeed is
obscure to such as want fayth, & are destitute
of the holy Ghost, but easy & playne
to those which abide & perseuere in the
faith of the Church, & by that meanes are
guided & gouerned by the holy Ghost.
4. The Word of God shineth brightly,
the Word of God, I say, not the word of

men, not the word of the Diuell, for that
only is the true Word of God which is in
the true sense & not in the bare letter; for
the letter depraued by a false sēse is not the
Word of God, but the word of men or rather
the word of the Diuell: the word of
God doth illuminate the eyes, but the
eyes of such as haue eyes to see, and not
their eyes,2. Cor. 4. v. 4. 
               whose mindes Satan hath blinded, so as
the light of the Ghospell cannot shine to them.
            
            5. In vaine therefore do our Aduersaries
heape togeather so many places of
Scripture, in which it is said, that the
Word of God is said to be cleare, ful of light, &
perspicuous, for this is not attributed by the
Scripture to the bare letter, but to the letter
ioyned with the true sense, which true sēse cannot
be had out of the Catholike Church.
            6. Neyther doth the Scripture say,
that the Word of God is manifest to all indifferently,
but to such only, as being indued
with the true fayth, are humble o
                  •
                hart,
and therefore inspired by the holy
Ghost; if therefore our Aduersaries will
haue the Scripture to be full of light, and
easy to be vnderstood of them, it is necessary
that they returne againe to the true
Church, in which only is true faith, 
                  〈◊〉

& the true spirit of God, without whi
                  ••
               
the holy Scripture will neuer be plaine,

cleare and manifest: for it is great imprudency,
I will not say impudency, to contend
so eagerly and with such hostility
about the plainenes and perspicuity of the
holy Scripture, and to haue no will to returne
into that way, the which only
leadeth to that plainenes and perspicuity.
         
         
            CHAP. XIII.
            Whether the holy Scripture be to be translated
into the vulgar tongue.
            THAT we may briefly dispatch
that which hath beene so largely
treated of by many concerning
this matter, we will reduce all
vnto foure generall assertions. The first
is; There is not doubt but the Word of
God is to be preached to the people in the
vulgar tongue, so as the question is only of
the bare written letter.
            2. The second assertion is; Neyther
the example of Christ, nor of the Primitiue
Church do cōuince that the Scripture is to
be translated into the vulgar tongue, but
rather the contrary, for Christ neuer commaunded
the Iewes to translate the Scriptures
out of the Hebrew tongue into the Syriac,
and yet in Christs tyme the auncient
Hebrew tongue was to the Iewes as the Latin

is to the French, Italians, and Spanyards, and
only the Syriac tongue was in vse amongst
the common people, which euen our Aduersaris
confesse, such I meane as are the
more skillfull in the Syriac, and Hebrew tongue,
as namely these, Sebastian Munster in his
preface before his Siriacal & Chalda
                     •
                  cal Grammer,
Francis Iunius in his preface before the new Testament

                  , Peter Martin
Morentine of Nauarre in the preface of his Caldaicall
Grammer printed at Rochell the yeare 1590.
            3. Neyther did S. Paul write in
Latin to the Romanes but in Greeke, though
not the Greeke tongue but the Latin was
their vulgar tongue.Hier. de Script. So S. Luke did write
the actes of the Apostles at Rome in Greeke
and not in Latin.
               Eccles. in Luca. See S. Aug. l. 2. de doct. Christ. c. 11. & seq 
                     •
                  
                And euen to S. Augustines
tyme foure hundred yeares after Christ, the
Byble was not extant but in the three learned
tongues, Hebrew, Greeke and Latin, no not
in the tyme of Rabbanus Maurus, who liued
eight hundred yeares after Christ, as
himselfe testifyeth in expresse words.
            4. Neyther can our Aduersaries alleadge
any authenticall example of the
auncient Church for the translation of
the Scripture into the vulgar tongue:Rabb. l. 5. de inst. Cler. c. 8.
they tell vs indeed of one Vulphilas a Bishop
of the Gothes who is said to haue
translated the Scripture into the Gothish
tongue, but he was not a Catholike,

but an Arian Heretike,Theod. lib. 4. hist. Ecc. c. vlt. Socrat. lib. 4. c. 27. Sozom l. 6. c. 37. Cass. in hist. 
                     •
                  ripart. l. 8. c. 13. as witnesse Theodoret,
Socrates, Sozomenus, and Cassiodorus.
            
            5. For as for that which certayne
late writers alleadge of S. Chrysostome his
translating of the Scripture into the Armenian
tongue, as also of S. Hierome his translating
of the same into the Dalmatical tōgue,
there can no certayne proofe be brought
thereof. And they who write this, do
not affirme, that all the Scripture was
translated by them, but certayne partes
only vsed of old to be read in the prayers
of the Church, as the Psalmes, Epistles,
Ghospels, and Lessons which were song publickely
at Masse, & in the Canonicall houres.
which we read to haue byn graunted by
Pope Iohn the eight of that name, to the
Morauian
                     •
                  
                at their first conuersion to the
faith of Christ, but this was 880. yeares
after Christ, and this custome was of no
long continuance amongst them, as appeareth
by that which Pope Gregory the
seauenth writeth to the Duke of Bohemia,
               Baron. Tom. 10. ann. 880. n. 19. & Tom. 11. ann. 1080. n. 1. &
is to be seene in Cesar Baronius.
            
            6. The third assertion; To translate
the Scripture into the vulgar tongue is
neyther in it selfe vnlawfull, nor forbidden
by any Ecclesiasticall law, so it be
truly translated. Nay such a translation
serueth Preachers to great vse, who are
to cite and expound the Scriptures to the

people in the vulgar tongue. Hereticall
translations are indeed forbidden, especially
of the new Testament, because in
them many places of holy Scripture are
by false translating corrupted.
            7. The fourth assertion; It is not a
thing profitable to all to read the Scriptures
in the vulgar tongue, yea to many it
is rather pernicious, for we are taught by
the Apostle S. Peter,
               2. Pet. vlt. v. 26. that in the Scriptures
are many thinges hard to be vnderstood,
which vnlearned, and vnstayed persōs
depraue to their owne destruction. Many
also there are vncapable of meate and
solid sustenance, who are therefore to be
fed with milke,1. Cor. 3. v. 2. Heb. 5. v. 12. as the Apostle speaketh,
and for such it is more wholesome to be
fed by the sermons and instructions of
their Pastors, then to feede themselues
with reading the Bible. It was therefore
great prudence of the Church to forbid
that the Bible, though translated and set
forth by Catholikes, should be read of
all indifferently,Index. lib. prohibit. Reg. 4. and without the approbation
and leaue of the Bishop, Pastor, or
Ghostly Father.
            8. Our Aduersaries obiect certayn
places of S. Chrysostome, and S. Hierome,
in which they exhort to the reading of
the Scripture, but they should haue obserued
that those Fathers speake of reading

the Scripture in the Greeke tongue then
extant, or in the Latin according to the
old edition, which was neuer forbidden
to any by the Church: whereas our Controuersy
is about the translations of the
holy Scripture out of the Hebrew, Greek
and Latin into the vulgar tongue, which
are all for the most part corrupted.
            9. And it is worth the nothing,
that our Aduersaries spend their tyme in
vayne, in gathering togeather arguments
by which to perswade men that it is necessary
for them to read the Scriptures in
the vulgar tongue, to the end they may
learne out of them what they must necessarily
know if they wilbe saued, for how
truly or plainly soeuer they be translated
no man shall euer recevue any fruite by
them, vnlesse he first belieue aright, and
be guided by the holy Ghost, to whome
it appertayneth to guide vs into the right
land,Psal. 142. v. 8. & 10. to make knowne vnto vs the way
in which we are to walke, to teach vs
the will of God which we are to fulfill.
VVhich is manifestly to be seene in the
Iewes who vnderstād the Hebrew text much
better then Christians, in which there is
so ample and cleare mention of Christ,
and yet for all that they do not belieue in
Christ-Our Aduersaries therefore haue
little reason to keepe such a do about the

wordes of Scripture, or the translation of
them, let them first imbrace the true Faith
which is in the Church only, let them
seeke after the holy Ghost who is not to
be found out of the Church, let them
seeke out the true sense of the Letter,
which the Church only conserueth vncorrupted,
and it will easily be graunted
vnto them to haue the Scriptures in what
tongue soeuer they will, so they be truly
and vncorruptedly translated, and that
they vse them to their owne saluation,
and not to their destruction, as many do,
wherof we haue for witnesses not only
the Scripture but dayly experience, and
this shall suffice concerning the translatiō
of the Scripture into the vulgar tōgue.
            10. For of the prayers in Latin eyther
priuately made by the people, or publikely
offered by the Priest at masse, and
in the administratiō of the Sacramēts, we
wil treat hereafter in their proper places.
         
         
            CHAP. XIIII.
            That our Aduersaries vse many sleightes
in corrupting the Word of God.
            OVR Aduersaries often require vs
to proue all that which we say
out of the written Word of
God, but when we cite the same in

expresse tearmes they haue many wayes
by which they depraue it. Wherfore before
I make an end of this Controuersy
concerning the written Word, it shall
not be from the purpose briefly to detect
such their corruptions; partly to the end
that no man be deceaued by them, and
partly that euery man may vnderstand
nothing to be so plainely and clearely set
downe in the written VVord, which by
the Commentaries of crafty and subtile
wittes may not be weakned and made
of little force, if no regard be had to the
authority and iudgment of the Church.
And that no man may thinke that I herin
calumniate them or deale lesse sincerely
with them, I will set downe out of their
owne writings some one or two exāpls of
each manner of corrupting, wherof many
exāples will occure in each Controuersy.
            2. The first manner of shifting of
places alleadged out of the written Word
is, to say, that the originall text is corrupted,
and what is alleadged crept out of
the margent into the text, whereof see
many examples in the 12. and 18. Chapter
of the Latin Edition of this Cōtrouersy.
            3. Their second shift is to reiect the
vulgar translation and instead thereof to
cite some new and corrupt translation
of their owne. It is euident inough,

that Luther in his first version of the new
Testament into the Germane tongue,Ioannes Coclaus de actis Luther. ann. 1522. set forth
in the yeare 1522. hath more then a thousād
errors, as many haue obserued, amōgst
which, neyther the last, nor the least is
his presuming to ad to the text of S. Paul
the 3. Chapter and 28. verse, the particle
alone, thereby the stronglier to establish his
doctrine, that Fayth alone iustifieth, for
this place of the Apostle, VVe thinke a man is
iustifyed by fayth, he trāslateth by fayth alone: &
when a certaine friend of his to whome
the same was obiected by a Catholike
asked the cause why he so translated it,Rom. 3 v. 28. he
no lesse ridiculously then proudly answereth,
in a certayne little booke set
forth by him in the yeare 1530. vnder
this title: A certaine information or answere
made to two questions proposed by
a certayne good friend concerning the
translation of Scripture, and the inuocation
of Saints.Luth. To. 4. Germ. excuso VVi
                     •
                  emb. anno 1551. fol. 475. pag. 2. In which he aduiseth his
friend to answere the Catholikes obiection
after this manner. D. Martin Luther
will haue it so, and sa
                     ••
                  h, that a Papist and an Asse
is all one thing: so I will, so I command, let my will
stand for a reason, for we will not be the Papists
schollers, but their Iudges. Luther will haue it so, &
he saith, that he is a Doctor aboue all the Popes Doctors.
So Luther, concluding at last that the
word (alone) shal remayne in his new Testament,
               
though it should make all his Aduersaries
mad: and he addeth further, that he
is only sory, that he had not added two
wordes more to the text, and translated it
after this manner▪ 
               we are ius
                     •
                  ifyed by only faith
without any workes of any law.
            
            4. Zwinglius also who first in our age
endeauored to perswade many, that the
body of Christ is not really contayned in
the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the better
to establish this his error, goeth about to
proue that those words of Christ, this is my
body, are very well translated thus, this signifieth
my body,Zuingl. de vera & falsa relig. c. de Eu
                     •
                  b. par. 262. in lib. excuso Tuguri. 1555. 
               & with this his new translation
he is so rauished, as if he had receaued
the same from heauen, for these are his
word
                     •
                  : So therefore hath Luke, with whome we
content our selues, without citing any other Euangelist.
And hauing taken bread he gaue thankes,
brake it, and gaue it them, saying, this signifyeth
my body which is giuen for you, do this in remembrance
of me. Thou seest O faithfull soule, but yet
wrapped in absurd opinions, how all thinges heere
agree, and nothing inviolently eyther taken away or
added, so as thou hast cause to wonder, that thou hast
not byn alwayes of this opinion, and much more
that any dare so boldly teare and rent the body of
this speach so well ioyned togeather. So Zwinglius in
the praise of his new translation, wherein
he arrogates more authority to himselfe,
thē is due, so as that of Cicero in his booke
               
de diuinatione may well be applyed to him,
I neuer saw any man arrogate greater authority to
himselfe, and in the end say iust nothing.
            5. Moreouer concerning Caluins and
Bezas errors in translating or rather peruerting
the holy Scriptures,Calu. l.

                  ine. 
               Bezas, and all the
Geneua Bybles. And this corruption is forged
a purpose by them to confirme a new
and notable blasphemy against Christ and
himselfe, by some apparent testimony of
Scripture, for they reach in many places
that Christ when he praied in the Garden
was seized with an extreme feare,Beza in maiori Catechis. Vol.

                  . tract. Theol. least

                  tathium Vignon. for they say he suffered vpon the
Crosse the paynes of a damned person, & the torments
of hell; for these are the impions
words of Caluin: Christ suffered in his soule the
torments of a forlorne, and damned man: and
Beza sayth, at what tyme Christ hang vpon
the Crosse, he was in the middest euen of the torments

of hell, which is as much, as to say,
that God himselfe was not only afraid of
the torments of hell, but that he suffered
and endured them, for it is euident that
Christ was true God. But against these absurd
paradoxes we are to dispute heerafter.
It shall suffice heere to shew, that
they haue depraued the holy Scripture,
to 
                  〈◊〉
                this their impious assertion, for
wheras it is written in the fifth to the Hebrewes,Heb. 5. v. 7.
and 7. v. that Christ was heard of
God for his reuerence, Caluin first, and after
Beza, and all the Geneua Bybles, make the
text to say, Christ was heard by reason of his
feare, or because he was afraid, but that in
the last Edition Beza hath added more
words to the text,Beza annot. ann
                     •
                   1598. making it sound
thus: His prayers being heard he was deliuered frō
this feare. Moreouer Caluin in his commentaris
and Beza in his annotations seeke
to proue out of this text, that Christ feared
eternall damnation, & that he was deliuered
out of this feare by his prayers which
he offered with teares: true it is that in the
French Bybles lately printed at Geneua, the
yeare 1
                  •
               05. they haue put in the margent,
vel pro sua reuerentia, where inforced
by truth they manifestly contradict Caluin
and Beza, who plainly deny that this
place is so to be trāslated, yet least their inconstancy
should be noted, they leaue

the former words in the text (ayant esté
exaucé 
                     〈◊〉
                   qu'il craignoit) that is in latin,
exauditus est eo, vel in eo, quod timuit.
            
            6. But all others as well Catholikes
as their Aduersaries who haue written
before Caluin, translate prosua reuerentia, vel
propietate sua, as Erasmus, Bucer, the Tiguriues
in their bibles of the yeare 1542. Nay Sebastian
Castalio for this cause sharply reprehendeth
Beza,

was the first that found out this new explication,
in a note of his vpon this 7. v.
se his editions of the yeare 1560. & 1565.
            7. The third shift is, their false exposition
of the text though neuer so truly
translated, for by diuers commentaries
and little notes in the margent, they goe
about to perswade the Readers the cleane
contrary to that which is expressely in
the text: see examples hereof in this
Chapter in the latin edition.
         
         
            CHAP. XV.
            The fourth, fift, and sixt shift that our
Aduersaries vse in deprauing the
Word of God.
            THE fourth shift of our Aduersaries is
to fly to figuratiue and metaphoricall
speaches, for it is most true that was

               Aug. l. 3 de doctrin. a Christ. cap. 10. 
               If (sayth
he) the mind be preoccupated with any erroneous
opinion, whatsoeuer the Scripture saith to the
contrary, men take to be a figuratiue speach.
And surely there is no kind of figuratiue
speaking to which our Aduersaries at one
tyme or another haue not recouse: but
there are three figures of which our Aduersaries
doe o
                  •
               tenest serue themselues
in deprauing the holy Scriptures, which
are these, Me
                     •
                  onymia, Hyperbole, and Ironia,
Metonymia is a figure very familiar with
Caluin,
               Matt. 26. v. 26. Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 17. sect. 21. for by it he peruerteth many places
of Scripture, yea euen those playne words
of Christ, this is my body: for hauing disputed
long about the sense of those words
at last he concludeth thus: I omit (sayth
he) Allegories and Parables, least any man should
thinke that, I seeke euasions, a
                     •
                  d to go from the
matter in hand, I say it is a Metonymicall speach.
So Caluin.
            
            2. By the figure Hyperbole our Aduersaries
shift of all those so euident testimonies,
by which wee proue that remisof
sinnes is obtayned of God by good
works,Tob. 4. v. 11. as are these: Almes deliuereth from
all sinne,
               Tob. 12. v. 9. 
               and death, and suffereth not the soule to go
into darknes. And againe, Almes deliuereth
frō death,
               Eccl. 3. v. 33. 
               & it is that that purgeth sinne & maketh
vs find mercy & life euerlasting. Moreouer water
putteth out a burning fier, and Almes resisteth sinne:
               
for the Lutherans say, that all these are Hyperbolicall
speaches.
               Apol. confess. Augustanae tit. de iustif. 
               Beza also seeketh to extenuat
by the figure Hyperbole that which the Apostle
writeth in the praise of the Roman
Church,
               Rom. 1. v. 8. Beza ibid. when he sayth, your haith is preached
all ouer tse world. Caluin in like manner by
the same figure not only depraueth many
places of the auncient Fathers,Lib. 4. Instit. c. 14. sect. vlt. but will
needes force Christ himselfe without any
need at all, to speake Hyperbolically. And finally
Philip Melancthon goeth about by the
figure Ironia to delude those manifest
wordes of Christ,Calu. in c. 6. Matt. v. 16. & in c. 24. v. 82. 
               that which remayneth, giue
Almes,
               Luc. 11. v. 41. Phil. in apol. Confess. Aug. tit. de iustif. 
               and behold all thinges are cleane vnto
you. For Philip contendeth that Christ
spake not those words in earnest, but in
iest, which he tooke from Erasmus, as he
did many other things, but Caluin and
Beza confesse,Erasmus in ānot. Luc. Calu. & Beza in illa verba S. Luc. that this is a foolish Ironia.
Albeit they also peruert the same wordes
another way, for they restrayne the word
omnia, only to meate.
            
            3. The fift shift is, when Catholiks
alledge plaine places of Scripture which
admit no figure, to say that the Scripture,
yea euen Christ himselfe did speake exactly,
but after a grosse and popular manner,
the meaning is, that he speaketh
only probably, and not solidly. For example
sake when wee proue that the Sacrament
of the Eucharist excelleth the Manna of the

               Iewes by these wordes of Christ,Ioan. 6. v. 48. & 49. your Fathers
indeed haue eaten Manna and are dead, this
is the bread descending from heauen, that if any man
eate of it he dye not, Caluins answere is, that
Christ accommodated his speach to the
grosse conceipt or opinion of the Iewes.
               l. 4. Instit c. 14. sect. 25.
When we proue the Exorzismes of the
Church, by which she casteth out diuells,
to be holy, because Christ sayth, one Diuell
will not cast out another, Caluin answereth, we
must remember (sayth he) that when Christ vseth
such prouerbes,
               Calu. in illum v. 25 Matth. 12. 
               as are in vse among the people,
he vseth them only, as probable coniectures, and
not as solid proofes. So he. No meruaile therfore,
if our Aduersaries say our arguments
are not solid, seeing they write so
much of Christs owne arguments.
            4. Their sixt shift is, to answere to
such plaine testimonies as are alledged
out of Scripture against their errors, that
the Scripture speaketh not simply, that is to
say, not truly, but according to the false
opinion of them, ag
                  •
               inst whom it hath
to do, which indeed is nothing els, but
to deny the Scripture. This is an vsuall
shift of Caluin who interpreteth to dispute by
contention,
               Cal. l. 2. instit. c. 1
                     •
                  . sect. 7. to be all one, as to disput not according
to our owne mind, but according to
their error, and foolish affection who
obscure the light of the Ghospell. So as
when we proue that our Sacraments excell

the Sacraments of the old law,Coloss. 2. v. 17. because
S. Paul sayth, that the ceremonies of the
Iewes were shaddows of things to come, but Christ
the body it selfe. And againe, that the Sacrifices
of the law could not make perfect according to conscience▪
               
               Heb. 9 v. 9 & 13.
               but serued only to sanctification & cleansing
of the flesh: and 
                  〈◊〉
                that they could not take
away sinne.
               Heb. 10. v. 11. To all these places Caluin answereth,Cal. l. 4. Instit. c 14. sect 25.
               we are, sayth he, to obserue diligently
that the Apostle S. Paul in all these places speaketh,
not simpliciter, sed per contentionem, which
what it is to say, we haue interpreted out
of Caluin before.
         
         
            CHAP. XVI.
            Of the seauenth and eight shift.
            THEIR seauenth shift is when
they are vrged with expresse
words of Scripture to say that
they are to be vnderstood before
men, and not before God, or in truth. This
shift Caluin and Beza vse often, for thus
they rid themselues of these places, Euery
branch that bringeth not forth fruite, in me, he will
cut off▪

               re cōtendeth that the euill
which belieue in God are in Christ only
in the estimation of men▪ and not indeed:
whereof it followeth, that the words of
Christ are thus to be vnderstood, to wit,
that the euill

Christ, but are not so in truth.

               Man is
iustified by workes, and not by fayth alone, is interpreted
by Caluin and Beza, and almost all
other our Aduersaries of iustification only before
men, & not before God. See more exāples
in this Chapter in the latin edition.
            3. The eight shift is, when they know
not what to answere, to say it is an improper
speach, and by this occasion to change
the words of the Scripture into other
words of their owne forging. For when
we c
                  •
               te the words of Christ in which a reward
is promised to fasting and prayer,
Caluin turneth them of,Calu▪ in c. 6. Matt. v. 4. with this answere,
when Christ, sayth he, promiseth a reward from
God 
                     〈◊〉
                   fasting, he speakes improperly, as is sayd
a litte before. Cōcerning prayer, likewise

                  •

            CHAP. XVII.
            Of the ninth and tenth shift.
            THEIR ninth shift is, when the
words of Scripture are so playne
and manyfest, that they cannot otherwise
escape, they say at last,
that 
                  •
               e Scripture commendeth vnto vs a thing
impossi
                     •
                  e: and to make this shift more probable

                  •
               hey corrupt the text by adding the
parti
                  ••
                
               (si) as if the Scripture spake conditionally,

and not absolutely, for when
we cite the places of Scripture in which
life euerlasting is promised to such as
keepe Gods commandments,Matt. 19. v. 17. as when
Christ saith, if thou wilt enter into life, keepe
the commandments;
               Luc. 10. v. 28. And againe, do this and thou
shalt liue. The answere of Caluin and Beza
is,Calu. in 19. Matt. v. 17. that Christ in these words speaketh of a
thing impossible. Caluin vpō the former place
writeth thus: Some of the aunciēt Father
                     •
                  , saith
he, haue interpreted this place amisse, as do the Papists
after them, as if Christ should teach 
                     •
                  hat we
cold deserue life euerlasting by keeping the law. And
a little after he concludeth saying: This answere
of Christ is according to the old law, to wit
that no man can be accounted iust before God, but he
who 
                     •
                  hall satify the law, which is impossible. And
vpon the later place he writeth this,Calu in c. 16. Luc. v. 28. 
               it is
impossible, sayth he, to fulfill what the law commaundeth,
               Lib. 3. Instit. c. 17. sect. 7.
yea it is a principall axione with
Caluin. & a cōmō āswere to al such 
                  •
               laces.
A legal promise, saith he, ānexed to a condtion impossible
proueth nothing, & thus with s
                  •
               ch impossibilities
he dallieth with vs, & wth the
holy Scripture it selfe: so far forth, 
                  •
               s they
dare affirme, that the Apostle in one Chapter
auoucheth vnto vs seauen times thinges
impossible:
               Calu. & Beza. in c. 
                     •
                  . ad Rom. for wheras the Apostle in the
2. cap. of the Ep. to the Rom. and 6. affirmeth
first, that God will render t
                  •
                euery
one according to his workes, the interprete

the place thus, that God will indeed
giue to mē according to their good works
it there were any such, but that no man
can do any good worke before God.Beza in c. ad Rom. v. 6. annot.

                  edit. annis 1550. 1564. 1565.
               Is there any man, saith Beza, that shalbe able to
bring these workes which the Apostle saith shalbe
rewarde
                     •
                   with eternall life? And wheras in the
seauēth v. the Apostle saith, that God doth render
life euerlasting to such as seeke the same by the patience
of good works, their answere is, that he
insinuateth a thing impossible, and that no man
can do any good worke before God, no not the iustest
man, which is not worthy of eternall damnatiō.

progresse before all others in the way of the Lord, if
they cast their

                  yes vpon the Lord God, what worke
soeuer they attempt or go about, they see into be
accursed. And surely 
                  •
                for my part, could
easily belieue that such is the progresse of
our aduersaries in the way of our Lord▪

edition.
            2. The tenth & last shift is the wresting of
diuers wordes to a wrong sense, and to inuent
sundrie different vnderstandings of the
wordes, to build vpon it many interpretations
neuer heard of before, and for a
finall Conclusion to say,Luc. 22. v. 19. the place is obscure,
and therfore proueth nothing. For
