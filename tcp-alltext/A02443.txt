Seas harme them, let not Papiſtes amaze them, nor forraine enemies feare them: but thou Lord of hoſtes encourage
their harts, enable their handes, endue them with valure, graunt them ſafely to returne with glorious victorye.
Be thou their Captaine, their leader and their guide: pleade thou their cauſe with thē that ſtriue with them, and fight

England: ſo ſhall we ſing foorth the ſonges of glory in our great congregations vnto thee, and declare to our poſteritie
theſe thinges among the wonders that thou haſt doon of olde, namely how thou haſt girded vs about with might to battaile,
and how thou haſt ſubdued vnder vs, them that roſe againſt vs, and how thou haſt giuen vs the necks of our enemies
to their deſtruction, and to our great comfort and conſolation, we ſaying euermore, he that is mightye hath magnified

might and Maieſtie, be all lawd, praiſe, honor, and glory, now and euermore, Amen.
