            ¶The Prologue.
            MAny men speke / as they in the boke rede
            Of the paynes of purgatorye / but fewe it drede
            For many a man wotteth not / what thynge it is
            Therfore they drede it / the lesse ywys
            And for some men / haue therof no knowynge
            Of the place of purgatorye / not vnderstandynge
            Therfore I wyll tell / what it is in lykenes
            And in what place / as the boke is wytnes
            And whiche soules goth thyther / and for what syn
            And what maner of paynes / ben therin
            And also what thynge / is most in certayne
            That myght a mannes soule / brynge out of payne.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶Fyrste here it telleth
what is Purgatorye.
            
               PUrgatorye is / nothynge elles to tell
            But a clensynge place / soules in to dwell
            That haue done syn̄e / and haue cōtrycyon
            And ben in the waye / of saluacyon
            And there they shulde suffre / both sorowe and wo
            Tyll all theyr synnes / ben awaye ydo
            And clensed of all synnes / that euer they wrought
            Both in worde and wyll / in dede and eke in thought
            For so pured golde / neuer none there was
            As the soules shall ben / or they thens passe
            wherfore the payne / that the soule there shall hent
            Is more bytter / than all the tourment
            That all martyres suffred / both yonge and olde
            Syth that god was borne / and to the Iewes solde
            For the leste payne / of the paynes there
            Is more bytter / than the most payne that is here
            As wytnesseth a great clerke / and sayth shortly
            In a boke / that speketh of Purgatorye.
            Minima pena Purgatorii maior est maxima pena mundi.
            ¶He sayth the leste payne / is well more
            In Purgatorye / that greueth sore
            Than the most payne / that maye be
            In all this worlde / to fele or se
            For the payne there / is more ferse and fell
            Than herte maye thynke / or tonge maye tell
            Betwene the payne of hell / certaynly
            And betwene the payne / of Purgatorye
            Is no dyfference / but certes that one
            
               
Shall haue an ende / and that other none
            For the paynes of hell / shulde neuer cease
            Ne the soules therin / haue neuer release
            But in purgatorye / the soules dwelleth styll
            Tyll they ben clensyd / of all maner yll
            And as moche ben there .xl. dayes tolde
            As here .xl. yere / be a man neuer so olde
            So that a payne there / one daye to se
            Is as moche / as a yere tolde here maye be
            But euery daye of penaunce / that is done here
            Shall stande there in stede / of an hole yere
            As Chryste sayth openly / and wytnesseth well
            By his holy prophete / Ezechiell.
            Diem pro anno deditibi.
            ¶That is so moche / to vnderstande nowe
            For an hole yere / I gaue one daye to you
            Than serueth that payne / as the boke telleth
            To clense the soules / that therin dwelleth
            But penaunce here done / with good wyll
            Serueth for two thynges / goddes lawe to fulfyll
            One cause is / to clense the soules well
            Of all deedly synnes / and eke venyell
            Another is to haue / in heuen more mede
            To these two thynges / penaunce maye vs lede
            For euery penaunce that a man doth here
            Shall haue a specyall ioye / in heuen clere
            That euer without ende / shall than last
            Yf they done penaunce / with herte stedfast.
         
         
            ¶In what place Purgatorye is.
            THe place there / that purgatorye is holde
            Is vnder erth / as clerkes men tolde
            
               
Aboue the same place / as clerkes men telleth
            There that deed chyldren / vnchrystened dwelleth
            That from the fayre syght / of goddes face
            Ben put for euer / without any grace
            And that place / is euen aboue hell pyt
            Betwene purgatorye / and hell is it
            And so is the place / of purgatorye sette
            Aboue them both / thyther soules be fette
            That must nedes / theyr payne there haue
            And after that payne / Ihesus wyll them saue
            Yet aboue that stede / is that fayre place
            That god after his deth / vysyted through his grace
            And all that were there / with hym he toke
            And lefte none therin / as telleth the boke
            Nor from that tyme / as clerkes can tell
            Come neuer no soule / there for to dwell
            Ne neuer none hereafter / therin shall fall
            For that place is Lymbo / as clerkes it call
            That is a fayre pryson / as telleth the boke
            where oure forne fathers / were in yloke
            And of all these foure / men maye one hell make
            And eueryche of them / for hell maye be take
            And therfore holy churche / that for soules prayth
            Calleth purgatorye hell / and thus therof sayth.
            Domine Ihesu christe / libera animas omnium fidelium
defunctorum de manu inferni / et de profundis
aquaram. &c.
            ¶Lorde Ihesu chryste / delyuer out of hell honde
            All chrysten soules / that ben there vnder bonde
            That is from that place / in to heuen blysse
            For moche pyne / haue soules there ywysse
            But from the lowest hell / without any doute
            
               
Maye no soule thens / be delyuered oute
            Of mercy to haue / is no hope ne truste
            As holy Iob telleth / that the soth wyste.
            Quia in inferno / nulla est redemptio.
            ¶He sayth that in hell / that is so farre adowne
            Is neuer delyueraunce / for no raunsowne
            And therfore masses & prayers / helpeth them nought
            To the same soules / that thyther be brought
            For masse ne prayer / abateth not theyr pyne
            As wytnesseth the holy man / saynt Austyne.
            Si sarem patrem aut matrem in inferno / non pro eis orarem.
            ¶He sayth / yf my father and my mother were
            In the pytte of hell / and I wyst them there
            I wolde neuer / by daye ne by nyght
            Praye for them to god / that is full of myght
            But purgatorye so longe / last not maye
            For it lasteth no lenger / than tyll domes daye
            For after domes daye / as clerkes can se
            The place of purgatorye / shall no where be
            Than shall hell be full of fendes within
            That euermore shall last / to auenge synne
            But some men haue wonder / and asketh why
            That purgatorye is ordeyned / with mercy
            And hell without mercy / that is so lowe
            The cause why / men must well knowe
            For the same synne / that in erth is wrought
            From the erth vpwarde / ne passeth nought
            Than nedes punysshed / must be that synne
            Here vpon erth / or elles within
            That is here in erth / there that we dwell
            Other elles in purgatorye / or elles in hell
            For the soule synne / is so heuy and harde
            
               
That it draweth the soule / euer downewarde
            And tyll the synne / with penaunce be awaye nome
            Erst maye the soule / neuer to heuen come.
         
         
            ¶Of two Purgatoryes / that
god hath ordeyned.
            
               YEt telleth these clerkes / more openly
            That two purgatoryes / there be namely
            One is cōmon / for to tell
            That is within erth / aboue hell
            And the other / is specyally through grace
            That is here in erth / in dyuerse place
            For some ben not / in cōmon stede pyght
            But they ben punysshed here / by daye or nyght
            In many dyuerse stedes / within in theyr ghost
            There that they / haue synne done most
            But that pyne / maye be brought out of drede
            Through prayer of frendes / and almes dede
            To the whiche / they maye ghostly appere
            Through great grace / in dyuerse stede here
            That payne as I erst tolde / wonder sore greueth
            But it is a warnynge / to them that here lyueth
            And thus maye men here / truely se
            where that purgatorye / nedes must be.
         
         
            ¶Of the paynes that ben in
Purgatorye.
            IN purgatorye / as the boke wytnesse beryth
            Ben dyuerse paynes / that the soule deryth
            Many mo certes / than I can neuen
            But I fynde therof / wryten seuen
            That maye be called / paynes full well
            
               
And to you of them / I wyll tell somedell.
            ¶The fyrste payne / of the seuen ywys
            As men maye knowe / that redeth this
            Is the great drede / that the soule is in
            whan the body and it / departeth atwyn
            For the soule seyth / than aboute it stonde
            Many foule deuylles / to do it shonde
            And that syght is a payne / wonder greuous
            For the deuylles ben / so foule and hydeous
            So that so hardy man / was neuer none
            Here in erth lyuynge / in flesshe and in bone
            But yf a man sawe / that syght that he shall se
            Anone for drede / woode shulde he be
            A great payne it is than / to se suche a syght
            But more is to the soule / that therwith shall fyght.
            ¶The seconde payne / is next than afterwarde
            Is great drede of deth / that is wonder harde
            That the soule shall haue / with moche care
            Tyll the dome be gyuen / howe it shall fare
            For many aungelles / shulde all redy be there
            And many deuylles / with horryble chere
            Than shall the soule / betwene them stande
            And aungelles shall be / in her ryght hande
            And the deuylles shall be / in her lefte syde
            So that the soule / nedes must there abyde
            Tyll that her contakes / ben brought to ende
            For erst he wot not / whyther to wende
            whyther that god / wyll dampne it or saue
            Than shall the soule / so great drede haue
            Ryght as a man / that is amyddes the se
            In great peryll / and wot not whyther to fle
            whan tempestes falleth / and storme smarte
            
               
Than may he thens / neuer starte
            And as a man hath here / bodely drede
            whan he is enpeched / of any peryllous dede
            Before the kynges iustyce / and of the countre
            That ben charged / yf he gylty be
            Than wot he not / yf he shall be spylte
            Other ben delyuered / and the lawe fulfylte
            In great peryll of lyfe / maye that man be
            Yet hath the soule mor drede / than hath suche thre
            For yf it haue the dome / of dampnacyon here
            Than goth it to hell / and the deuylles fere
            And yf the soule be dampned / in to that place
            Than is no maner hope / of mercy and grace
            what wonder is than / though the soule haue drede
            That to god after / mercy dare not ones grede.
            ¶The thyrde payne / is an exyle
            whan that the soules / here some whyle
            Ben exyled from lyfe / and to deth brought
            For the cōmynge agayne / they knowe nought
            Therfore they shulde haue / moche mournynge
            whan they be dampned / from theyr lykynge
            And the mournynge that they haue / without lysse
            Shall than be to them / great anguysshe.
            ¶And the fourth payne / is dyuerse syckenes
            That soules haue / in moche dystres
            For dyuerse euylles / they shall haue therin
            For dyuerse dedes / that they dyd in synne
            And some for pryde / that they vsed ofte
            Shall haue the colde feuer / that is not softe
            For that shall greue the soule / more bytterly
            Than euer any feuer / dyde the body
            And some shall haue there / for couetyse
            
               
Stronge dropsye / that they shall not aryse
            And some shall haue / in all theyr ly
                  •
               es aboute
            For slouth in theyr lyfe / the podagre and goute
            And byles and felones / and postumes also
            That in mannes body / doth moche wo
            And some for wrath / shall haue the palsye
            That to the soule / shall sore derye
            And some for glotony / shall haue euermore
            The harde quynsy / that shall greue them sore
            And some for lechery / shall haue also
            A foule mesylry / go whyther they go
            Thus shall the soule / that god wyll saue
            For dyuerse synnes / dyuerse paynes shall haue
            That in erth here / had veray repentaunce
            And had not in erth / done theyr penaunce
            Nowe thynke we / what payne the body suffreth here
            Through dyuerse euylles / that greuyth euery where
            Though that it last / but a lytell stounde
            Yet it bryngeth a man / full soone to the grounde
            And as the maladye / greuyth the body sore
            Yet it greuyth for the tyme / the soule well more
            So that the soule / hath there more penaunce
            Than hath the body / for any maner greuaunce
            But nowe a man / maye speke there agayne
            And axe howe the soule / maye fele payne
            That after deth is so sottel / as in boke we rede
            That it maye occupye / no maner stede
            And to this questyon / I maye answere well
            As I haue clerkes / herde therof tell
            The soule of the body / the lyfe is
            Of euery man / both more and lesse
            And without lyfe / is nothynge lyuynge
            
               
For in no deed thynge / maye be any felynge
            Than is all the felynge / of the lyfe hooly
            All in the soule / and nought in the body
            For whan a mannes soule / is passed awaye
            Than is the body / but 
                  •
               oule erth and claye
            And that is than / as deed as any stone
            That no thynge feleth / but hym selfe one
            Yet maye some men aske / more therto
            Nowe maye the soule / that is in wo
            Be pyned / with suche maladye withoute
            That is in dyuerse lymmes / of the body aboute
            Syth it hath / neyther body ne hed
            Ne none other lymme / theron byleued
            To this / I maye answere shortly
            That the soule / though it haue no body
            It shall haue payne / as in lymmes there
            with whiche it dyd / most synne here
            For eche to other than / shall seme ywys
            As though it had the shape / as a man is
            And in this maner / shall a soule another se
            But certes none of them / maye feled be
            Nomore than maye / a mannes breth here
            whan it passeth from hym / in no manere
            Ensample of Lazar / and a ryche man
            That cordeth to this mater / as I proude can
            The ryche man warned / the lazar mete
            That in Abrahams bosome / had his sete
            But the ryche man / was buryed in hell
            And sawe lazar / in heuen dwell
            He cryed to Abraham / and bad fayre withall
            That a drope of water / myght downe fall
            Upon his tonge / from lazarus fyngers ende
            
               
For he myght not / out of that payne wende
            By the ryche man / that spake so to that other
            Had no lymme / ne tonge nother
            Ne lazar / as ye maye well vnderstande
            Had nother fynger / ne hande
            For they were / spyrytes both onely
            That had nother lymme / ne body
            But the ryche mannes soule / feled pyne in hell
            As though it had ben a body / in flesshe and fell
            And lazarus soule / semed to hym than
            As though he had ben / a lyues man
            But I haue herde / some clerkes mayntayne
            Suche maner opynyons / as I wene
            That a soule / that is in purgatorye
            Other in hell / hath of the ayre a body
            To suffre payne / in his lymmes there
            After that he hath / in erth synned here
            But whyther a soule haue / a body or none
            It shall haue payne / as the body hath done.
            ¶And the fyfth payne / though it be somwhat late
            Is hote brennynge fyre / that northynge maye bate
            But almes dede / masses and prayere
            That of frendes / for them ben done here
            To abate that fyre / tho thre ben best
            For they brynge soone / mannes soule to rest
            But that fyre / is hotter and more kene
            Than any fyre of this worlde / that maye be sene
            For all the water / that a man maye on thenche
            One sparcle of that fyre / myght not quenche
            For one sparcle of that fyre / is more brennynge
            Than all the fyre / in this worlde lyghtnynge
            And the soule is also / more tendre and nesshe
            
               
Than a mannes body / with blode and flesshe
            Than the soule / that is so tender of kynde
            Must nedes theyr penaunce / more harder fynde
            Than any maner body / that euer alyue was
            Though it shulde there through / make his pas
            But no soule maye / from thens wende
            Tyll all theyr penaunce / be brought to ende
            And that fyre / werketh not through kynde a ryght
            In the same soule / that to penaunce is dyght
            As doth the fyre / that in erth brenneth here
            But euermore it werketh / in another manere
            As god hath ordeyned / for why it is so
            As it were an instrument / that longeth therto
            Through the whiche / the soule clensed maye be
            In the payne of purgatorye / or that it god se
            For why all maner fyre / that is therin
            It is a maner fyre / for to waste synne
            For as the fyre in the worlde / maye all thynge brenne
            And make metall melt / and abrode renne
            And ryght so the fyre / there through longe heat
            wasteth there / both small synnes and great
            There be nowe fyres / some more some lesse
            But all one maner fyre / that neuer shall cesse
            For as the sonne / maye ouer all thynge passe
            That men greuyth / some more and some lesse
            Ryght so ye same fyre / that in purgatorye is brought
            Some soules it pyneth sore / and some nought
            For all soules / must nedes dwell therin
            After that theyr charge / is there of synne
            But some soules / shulde delyuered be thens soone
            That here in erth / haue theyr penaunce doone
            But some soule shall abyde there / many a yere
            
               
That lytell penaunce hath done / with his body here
            And hath lyued longe / in his synne also
            And therfore / saynt Austyn sayth thus therto.
            Necesse est vt tantus sit dolor: pro peccatis quantus fuerit
amor / tanto divtius anima torquetur in penis: quāto affec
                  •
               
tus mundanis inherebat desiderus. &c.
            ¶Saynt Austyn sayth / that nedefull it is
            That as moche sorowe / he haue here and no les
            For euery synne / and eke trespas
            As lust and lykynge / in the synne was
            And he sayth also / as before as rad
            That the more lykynge / that a man in synne had
            And euer gyueth therto / his lust and wyll
            His flesshely lykynge / all to fulfyll
            The longer must nedes / the soule in payne be
            In purgatorye / that he maye not fle
            And or the soule maye se god / in his face
            As thre thynges / they must brenne in that place
            That is to saye / as woode and haye also
            And stoble / that wyll awaye with the fyre go
            For the most venyall synnes / shulde brenne longe
            As a tre that is great / and hath rotes stronge
            But the small synnes / soone shall brenne awaye
            As doth stoble in erth / whan fyre cōmeth there nye
            But the meane synnes / brenneth not so soone
            For they brenne slowly / and haue more to doone
            Ryght as doth the haye / that with fyre is tende
            That longe lyeth & smoketh / or it be through brende
            Thus shulde they ben brende / and wasten sore
            For theyr venyall synnes / both lesse and more
            And for deedly synne / that they ben of shryue
            And the trespasse therof / god hath forgyue
            
               
And penaunce therfore / nought haue done here
            They shall there be brende / in the same manere
            And whan they be fyned / and made bryght
            Than shall they come / before goddes syght
            In to mery Paradyse / that is a ioyfull place
            That is euermore full / of mercy and grace.
            ¶And the fyxte payne / is for to tell
            For the soules vnclensed / shulde there dwell
            Styll in purgatorye / and be bounde fast
            with bondes of synne / to make them agast
            And as many soules / as be in that prysone
            For no gyfte they maye / ne for no raunsome
            From that harde payne / them selfe wynne
            Tyll that fyre haue brent / theyr bondes of synne
            And thus they ben bounde / both handes and fete
            In hote brennynge fyre / that is wonder greate
            Certes than me thynketh / no payne maye be more
            Than the soules suffreth / that greuyth them sore
            For nothynge thens / maye them borowe
            Nother abrydge any thynge / of theyr moche sorowe
            Nother to helpe them / thens to be brought
            For theyr owne prayer / ne helpeth them nought
            But yf in erth / they any good dyde
            As masses done / songe and almes dede
            Of theyr frendes in erth / ye to god for them besought
            That made this worlde / and all thynge of nought
            Full harde ben the paynes / ye the soules suffre there
            Yf hope of mercy / soone after ne were
            But some tyme they shulde / so moche payne haue
            That they take no kepe / that god wyll them saue
            Therfore we shulde thynke / that in erth ben here
            what payne the soule suffreth / that is there
            
               
Amonge soule fendes / that there haue leue
            Some tyme the soules / to tourment and greue
            As longe as they haue / any spotte of synne
            For erst from that place / maye no man them wynne
            Tyll they ben clensed / and made all clene
            Of all maner synnes / that none be sene
            And whan they ben deyuered / of all maner synne
            No more payne / shall they fele therin
            But soone than after / they shall euen wende
            To the blysse of heuen / that hath none ende.
            ¶And the seuenth payne / is in lykenesse
            There that the soules ben / as in wyldernesse
            There that defaulte is / of all good thynge
            That a man myght haue / of his lykynge
            For theyr payne to them / is many foide
            For nowe they ben in great hete / and nowe in colde
            And that payne to them / is full longe
            As nowe in great hete / and after colde stronge
            And there shulde suffre / both hungre and threst
            And many great that paynes / without any rest
            And sore ben bette / to make more theyr payne
            with great stormes of hayle / and of rayne
            And that betynge / is both sharpe and kene
            But suche stormes / neuer erst were sene
            As the soules there / shulde fele and se
            And with dyuerse tourmentes / tourmented be
            For some many a yere / shall abyde there for synne
            Tyll they the syght of god / cleanly maye wynne
            And suche maner paynes / they shall haue euermore
            with many other tourmentes / ye shall greue them sore
            But amonge all other / a great payne that shall be
            The moche coueytyse / that they haue to se
            
               
The swete face of god / that is euer so bryght
            And the longe taryenge / of tht fayre syght
            But to that same syght / maye they neuer come
            Tyll all theyr synnes / from them be nome
            And here I haue tolde / somedell to you
            Of the paynes of purgatorye / that be harde ynowe.
         
         
            ¶Of the soules that wendeth in to purgatorye / and

               THe soules that / to purgatorye shulde wende

            And suffre paynes / that ben smart and fell
            For eueryche syn̄e: there shalbe punysshed after kynde
            Through bytter paynes / that there they shulde fynde
            After that theyr dedes / ben more or lasse
            And theyr penaunce haue done / or they hens passe
            But all soules / abydeth not in that place
            For some after theyr deth / anone haue grace
            And sykerly / shulde wende to blysse
            As holy Innocentes / that neuer dyd mysse
            And other soules / of good men and parfyte
            That neuer in erthly thynge / had any delyte
            But onely on god / that them dere bought

And that is no wonder / me thynketh in my mynde

            And also the penaunce / that is hym enioyned
            Ben not done here / at dayes apoynted
            wherfore the soule / is not clensed clene
            Of other small synnes / that ofte cōmeth betwene

            And the holy baptysme / at the font stone
            Yet telleth these clerkes also / in this manere

For that fyre / wyll fonde hym to brenne

            Both yonge and olde / more and lasse
            For that same fyre / that is there within

            These ben thynges / as saynt Austyn telleth
            That maketh in purgatorye / ye many soule dwelleth
            That haueth there / moche sorowe and wo
            And there ben yet / of other wyckednesse many mo
            And of venyall synnes / full many a score
            without them that I / haue tolde before
            But so wytty / is none erthely man
            That all venyall synnes / tell can
            For oft tymes / in the daye men falleth
            In to synnes / that men venyall calleth
            And euery he synne / is worthy a payne
            That is done in dede / or in worde in vayne
            That must clenely / be fordone
            Here or in purgatorye / euerychone
            Therfore I counceyll / eche man that be wyse
            To haunt this lore / that is of pryse
            That fordoth / through holy mannes lore
            All venyall synnes / both lesse and more
            And yf any man fall / in deedly synne
            Lette hym aryse / and lye not therin
            And take a preest / and do hym to shryue
            And do his penaunce / by his lyfe
            And euermore / haue in his thought
            Sorowe for synnes / that he hath wrought
            And do his penaunce / with all his myght
            And praye to god / both daye and nyght
            And go woolwarde / and fast and wake
            And suffre dysease / for our lordes sake
            
               
For no man maye / in to heuen go
            But yf he suffre here / both sorowe and wo
            And whan god greuyth a man / in any wyse
            Than shulde he suffre it / without fayntyse
            what syckenes that maye / any man greue
            Or losse of catell / that god wyll hym reue
            Or vnkyndenes / falshed other treason
            Or any dysease / that myght be agaynst reason
            Than suffre it mekely / and thynke in thy thought
            That without encheson / ne cōmeth it nought
            But god wottes all / and why it is
            Perchaunce for thynges / that he hath done amys
            To chastyce hym / in suche manere
            For synnes that he / hath done here
            Or it maye be / hym to preue
            To the loue of god / the more hym to meue
            For oft tyme that thynge / that god wyll saue
            Angre and dysease / he must haue
            Other for his synnes / is that sonde
            Than shulde he thanke / goddes honde
            And take mekely / that god hym sendeth
            And fle all euyll thynge / that he defendeth
            For through dyseases / and angres here
            He maketh a man / as a prysonere
            Penaunce to suffre / for his folye
            That he hath done / through the deuylles trecherye
            For yf he suffre it / without grutchynge
            It standeth hym in stede / of penaunce alowynge
            And afterwarde / god wyll more to hym do
            Gyue hym great mede / and grace also
            And full blysse in heuen / haue therfore
            Yf he take it mekely / though it greue hym sore
            
               
As a good chylde / suffreth mekely and styll
            whan his father chastyseth hym / after his wyll
            And done all goodnesse / and lette all quede
            And so shulde eche man / suffre god and drede
            And namely / almes dede ofte to make
            Cloth the naked / and to the hungrye mete take
            And other werkes of mercy / ofte to werche
            As techeth vs / good men of holy churche
            And lede clene lyfe / in to his lyues ende
            And after his deth / his soule shall wende

            ¶Of the helpe that soules hath that ben in
purgatorye, of good frendes that ben left
behynde them lyuynge in erthe.
            THe soules that / to purgatorye wendes
            Be brought thens / through helpe of frēdes
            That done almes dede / for them well afyne
            And so sayth the holy man / saynt Austyne.
            Non est negandum ꝙ spiritus defunctorum pietate amicorum
suorum viuentium possint refeuari ab omnibus penis. &c.
            ¶He sayth it is not to gayne saye / in no manere
            That the soules of them / that deed ben here
            From payne myght soone / vnbounde be
            Through frendes in erth / that had of them pyte
            Foure maner of helpes generall / me maye call
            
               
That in purgatorye auayleth to the soules all
            That is byddynge of Pater noster / and eke fastynge
            And almes dedes / and masses syngynge
            And in two maners / as clerkes can se
            The soule from purgatorye / delyuered maye be
            One is / through grace and mekenesse
            And another / through waye of ryghtfulnesse
            By waye of grace / in two manere
            As it is wryten / in this boke here
            Fyrst prayer to chryste / that is our heed
            whan he is offred / in fourme of breed
            In the preestes handes / with good entent
            whan the breade is tourned / in to the sacrament
            As through prayer / of goddes seruauntes here
            That euer ben busye / in theyr prayere
            Than maye the soule / that in purgatorye is
            Through waye of grace / specyally haue this
            Delyueraunce of payne / that there sore greuyth
            Through masses and prayers / that there releuyth
            And by waye of ryghtfulnesse / it is helpe also
            By two wayes / that I can shewe therto
            Fyrste through almes dede / that me gyueth the poore
            It is brought of payne / that greuyth it sore
            Another is / of theyr penaunce abrydgynge
            Through penaunce of frendes / and of fastynge
            Thus maye the soule / as the boke is wytnesse
            Be helpe / through waye of ryghtfulnesse
            That is to saye / that they maye in that nede
            Be brought from payne / through almes dede
            And through penaunce / and through pardon
            Tyll there ben payed / a certayne raunsom
            Than maye the soule / be delyuered awaye
            
               
Through frendes that wyll / theyr raunsome paye
            And thus maye the soules / that hens wendes
            To purgatorye be helpe / through theyr frendes
            But some maye helpe / and some maye nought
            The soules / that in to purgatorye be brought
            But through suche frendes / they maye helpe be
            That lyueth here in erth / in parfyte charyte
            For the helpe of them / that charyte fayleth
            To the soules in purgatorye / no thynge auayleth
            For they ben all / as lymmes of one bodye
            That ben in erth here / and tho in purgatorye
            And as we maye se / proprely here
            One body haue / many lymmes sere
            And eche of them / both lesse and more
            Maye another helpe / yf it greue them sore
            But yf one of the lymmes / begynneth to fayle
            That lymme maye to the other / lytell auayle
            Ryght so it fareth / in the same wyse
            By hym that lyeth in payne / and may not aryse
            As they that be in purgatorye / in theyr penaunce
            without helpe of frendes / haue none alegaunce
            But who that in deedly synne / is brought
            And charyte / in his herte hath nought
            He ne is / but as deed in soule within
            As longe as he is / in that deedly syn
            And his helpe ne is / but as in vayne
            To soules that dwelleth / in that payne
            For that helpe standeth / in no maner stede
            Nor nought auayleth / that they haue bede
            And neuerthelesse / all though that he so be
            In deedly synne / and out of charyte
            Yet maye the soule / be helpe thus
            
               
Yf he to the poore man / gyue almes
            That they for the soule / specyally praye
            That lyeth in purgatorye / as I you saye
            Yet maye the helpe / and the trauayle
            Of a synfull man / to the soule auayle
            Yf it in byddynge / done here be
            Of a frende / that is in charyte
            That helpe maye auayle / the soule soone
            For his sake / that byddeth it to be done
            That in his herte / hath charyte knyt
            And for his sake / wolde do it
            For god wyll nothynge do / for his sake
            That wyll not charyte / in his herte take
            This case falleth ofte / as I vnderstande
            Betwene a lorde / and his seruaunt bonde
            There that the lorde / good and ryghtfull is
            And his seruaunt / is wycked ywys
            And yf his seruaunt do / any maner thynge
            That is good / to the lordes byddynge
            Yet it maye auayle / to some profyte
            Though he in goodnes / haue no delyte
            And that is through reason / and goodnes ywys
            Of hym through whom / that prayer is
            For though it be / agaynst the doers wyll
            Yet as agaynst the bydder / it standeth styll
            But yf in charyte / they were bothe
            The more were the helpe / to the deth for sothe
            And also though a preest / in any maner tyme be
            Synfull / and out of charyte
            Yet he is goddes mynyster / and holy churches
            That the sacrament / vpon the aulter werches
            That is nought / the lesse of myght
            
               
All thoughe / the preest lyue not aryght
            For though a preest / that syngeth the masse
            Be neuer so full / of wyckednesse
            Yet that sacrament / that is so holy
            Maye not be enpayred / through his foly
            Than maye a masse / from payne soules brynge
            Though a synfull preest / doth it synge
            For he syngeth the masse / in goddes name
            Under whiche ordre / he maye do no shame
            But preuy prayers made with good entent
            That be sayde / besydes the sacrament
            Of a good preest / doth more god paye
            Than of a synfull preest / vsed eche daye
            But the offrynge / of goddes body so swete
            Bryngeth many soules / from paynes greate
            wherfore me thynketh / that masses syngynge
            Maye rathest a soule / from payne brynge
            That goth out of this worlde / in charyte
            And in purgatorye / clensed shall be
            But to them / that be dampned for aye
            No good dede / to them auayle maye
            Nother almes dede / prayer ne masse
            For they ben / as the boke bereth wytnesse
            Departed fro chryste / that of Mary was borne
            And the soules of them / euer be forlorne
            And as lymmes ben deed / and layde in claye
            And all ben / from the body awaye
            Than maye nothynge helpe / in no maner kynde
            The lymmes that ben dryed / as it were a rynde
            Ryght so all the helpe / that a man can tell
            Nothynge auayleth / to them that be in hell

For pardon that is / ryght full and certayne
            Maye a man release / both of dette and payne
            As farre as the pardon / maye it areche
            For thus haue I lerned / through clerke speche
            Pardon is nothynge elles / to vs in lykenesse
            But of payne that is dette / forgyuenesse
            Pardon maye no man haue / but he well werche
            For it is a treasoure / of holy churche
            That gadred is / for mede of pardon
            Through vertue / of Chrystes holy passyon
            And of the worthynesse / and of the dedes
            Of holy sayntes / and of theyr medes
            And it is gadred / of mykell goode
            Fyrste through martyrdome / and shedynge of blode
            Of holy Martyres / that moche loued Chrystes laye
            For whose loue they were brought / in to great afraye
            And in penaunce / and trauayle of confessours
            And through good techynge / of wyse doctours
            And of chastyte / of good vyrgynes and clene
            That to god euer / wolde theyr mone mene
            And also / of all holy churche werkes
            And of prayers / of holy preestes and clerkes
            And of all this / that I haue nowe before tolde
            Is gadred this treasoure / both newe and olde
            And of that treasoure / the Pope bereth the kaye
            That openeth and closeth / and synnes doth awaye
            For that falleth to hym / of offyce to holde
            For he is vycar in erth / god hym make wolde
            The kayes be nothynge elles / to vnderstonde
            But ful power / gyuen to hym through goddes sonde
            Through whiche power / he maye the lawe fulfyll
            Bynde and vnbynde / after his wyll
            
               
For the same power / hym falleth to haue
            That god gaue to Peter / soules to saue
            For god gaue to Peter / in erth full power
            And sayde to hym / in this maner.

            Shall be vnbounde / in heuen bryght
            This power to all popes / gaue our lorde
            After saynt Peter / to holde that worde
            As telleth therof / in an exposycyon
            Of the Gospell / in a lesson
            Than semeth it well / by this reason
            That eche pope hath / a great iurysdyccyon
            To assoyle a man / and hym forgyue
            All dettes of payne / that he shulde be to dryue
            But yet must a man yelde / forsothe also
            All that he hath wrongefully / take or do
            For the pope / whan he graunteth that grace
            He byndeth holy churche / in that same place
            For hym / to whom that grace auayleth
            To fulfyll all thynges / that hym fayleth
            But the bysshoppes / that ben of lesse state
            Haue lesse power / as clerkes knoweth that
            For theyr dygnyte / is moche lasse
            Therfore they / maye not theyr power passe
            And though it be / not so suffysaunt
            As is the popes / yet they maye make a graunt
            Of theyr power of pardon / a great partye
            To theyr vnderlynges / both lowe and hye
            
               
But yet it must / as I before haue sayde
            Be gyuē through holy churches treasour: by god rede
            And neuerthelesse / there maye no man pardon wynne
            But he ben out / of deedly synne
            For he that hath / the kepynge of that treasoure
            That to mannes soule / is so precyous a floure
            Maye not gyue it / to holy churches foose
            Lest he gette hym therby / an euyll loose
            For suche men they ben / and none other ywys
            That dwell in deedly synne / and euer doth amys
            For they ben out / of holy churche lawe
            Therfore they maye / no pardon to them drawe
            But frendes of holy churche / maye well craue
            After pardon / for they shulde it haue
            For they be suche / that euer be fre
            Of deedly synne / and in parfyte charyte
            To them suche pardon / shall neuermore fayle
            But in purgatorye / to them shall auayle
            To brynge out of payne / theyr soules clene
            As ferforth / as the pardon maye mene
            As clerkes telleth / that god wyll sette
            For the remenaunt of paynes / that ben of dette
            That perchaunce is lefte / and not done here
            As it maye fall / in dyuerse manere
            A partye of penaunce / that is enioynt
            And is not done here / before dethes poynt
            And in partye / of venyall synnes wrought
            And in partye of synnes / that ben out of thought
            And in partye / for lytell repentaunce
            And in partye / for ouer lytell penaunce
            And in partye / of penaunce enioynt and not do
            And perchaunce / with lytell deuocyon also
            
               
And all these maye be called / the remenaunt
            Of dette of payne / that is not suffysaunt
            That shulde be fulfylled / in erth here
            Other in purgatorye / to make the soules more clere
            But suche dette / maye soone there be quyte
            who that to suche pardon / hath any delyte
            In forgyuenesse of all penaunce / ye maye be thought
            whether it be enioyned here / or be nought
            For so moche pardon / maye a man pourchace
            Here in his lyfe / that he maye haue grace
            In purgatorye to be quyte / of all maner dette
            That from the blysse / myght hym lette
            For so large / is holy churches treasoure
            That it maye brynge soules / from all doloure
            And from all paynes of dette / that maye be
            Of all men that ben / in chrystente
            And thus pardon / i purgatorye to soules may auayle
            But some clerkes / gyueth vs counceyle
            That we shulde kepe it / and hooly spare
            Tyll we to purgatorye / come all yare
            And in erth do penaunce / whyle we maye
            For a man in purgatorye / shall thynke one daye
            Longer than hym thought / euer in erth here
            The space and tyme / of an hole yere
            Than is one daye of pardon / in forgyuenesse
            More worth / than all this worldes rychesse
            For the soule had leuer / that suche payne shall dryue
            One daye of pardon / than any thynge on lyue
            For all this wyde worlde / and it were his
            He wolde gyue to haue rest there / one daye ywys
            Of this mater / that I make of mencyon
            Is good helpe of frendes / and eke of pardon
            
               
That auayleth to them / that in pryson be sette
            wherfore I haue / myne auctours for me fette
            And so sayth Innocent / and saynt Austyne
            That speketh in theyr bokes / of this well afyne
            And mayster Raymonde also / speketh of the same
            In a boke / that is called after his name
            And Thomas Alquin / speketh also
            Of this mater / and other mo
            In a boke that is / of great phylosophye
