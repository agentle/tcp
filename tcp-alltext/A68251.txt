               And to her ioy, ſhe now is gone,
               to heauen for an Angels throne
               Leauing her Honoure and her Crowne,
               to princely IAMES, of great renowne.
               
                  O Hone, honinonero. &c.

               And ſought to ſtop her princely breath:
               but yet ſhee dide a naturall death.
               And to our comfort God did ſend
               King IAMES, his Goſpell to defend.
               
                  O hone, honinonero. &c.
               
            
            
               The Romiſh Pope, who many a day,
               hath looked for a violent pray,
               Fruſtrate by Wiſedomes power and care,
               Is readie now for to diſpaire:
               And in a ſound he ſinketh downe,
               now noble Iames hath got the Crowne
               
                  O hone, honinonero. &c.
               
            
            
               With his raigne doth the Spring begin,
               as Vſher for to bring him in:
               Which in conſent doth well agree
               withe'yeere, the incarnate word to bee:
               And in that month greeing by fate,
               by th'old world to wiſedome dedicate.

               And I deuine thus by the yeere:
               England ſhall haue no other peere:
               But in his line it ſhall remaine,
               In ſpight of Pope and cruell Spaine,
