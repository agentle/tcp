Chriſts Deſcenſion
into Hell:
By
JOHN HIGINS.
            AT OXFORD,
By IOSEPH BARNES, Printer to
the Vniverſitie. 1602.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE CHRISTIAN
Reader Iohn Higins wiſheth
perfect knowledge of the Creed
in Chriſt Ieſu▪
            
            
               AT first (Chriſtian
Reader) I vvrote
theſe things more
at large, interpoſed
with the other
which I tooke vpō
mee to aunſwere.
But now I thought
it farre better thus to ſet them at view
after this maner, which I could not with
out the much abridging of that my firſt
copie. And this I did for two cauſes;
the one to ſaue my labor in writing them
out: the other to eaſe thee in reading thē
over. I haue prefixed each of our names,
and by the letters, A. B. C. D. E. &c. applied
the reaſons and anſwers of the one

to the other, that ſo thou maieſt the eaſier
compare the places of both togither, and
better conſider & ſentence of both. This
I doe becauſe I thinke plaine dealing a
Iewell, and this order is better. Now (if
it pleaſe thee) I pray thee on kindeneſſe,
with conſcience and charity to read thē:
read, regard, and then iudge; but beware
thou iudge not amiſſe, leaſt thy iudgment
endamage thy ſelfe. And ſo wiſhing thee
to beleeue all the Articles of the Creede,
and withall wiſhing thy health in Chriſt
Ieſu, Iende.

               It ſeems very likely that theſe words 
                  (hee deſcended into hell) were not placed
in the Creed at the firſt,Pet. Vire

                   or as ſome
thinke they crept in by negligence.
               Becauſe aboue threeſcore Creedes 
of the moſt Ancient Councels, and Fathers
want this clauſe, and amongſt the
reſt the Nicen Creede.
               But if the Ancient learned Fathers 
aſſembled in thoſe Counſels had beene
perſwaded, or at leaſt had imagined
that theſe wordes had bin ſet downe at
the firſt by the Apoſtles, no doubt they
would not in any wiſe haue left thē out.
               And an Ancient father ſaith directly,
that theſe wordes (He deſcended into
                  Ruffinus i
                        •
                      expoſit. Symbol.
                  hell) are not found in the Creede of
the Romane Church, nor vſed in the
churches of the Eaſt, & if they be, that
then they ſignifie the Buriall of Chriſt.
            
            
               
               IOHN HIGINS.
               
                  
                  It ſeemed to ſome men that certaine
bookes of the Newe Teſtament were
not Canonical, but in that ſeming their
thoughts were not worthy to be made
accoumpt of. Wherefore theſe words:
ſome mē
                   (of yeſterday) thinke they crept
in:
                  
                     
                        •

                     tles. ca. 2. are no ſufficiēt groūd to build on in
matters of ſuch antiquity, weight & authority
as theſe are. I reckon not of Eraſmus
in the imitatiō of Luciās Dialogues,
but I know he writeth on the Acts of the
Apoſtles, that Chriſt deſcēded into hel.
               
                   If we deny al the clauſes which thoſe
60. Creedes want, the Creed wil be very
ſhort. For example, your Nicen
Creed hath not theſe, borne of the Virgin
Mary, he was buried, he ſitteth on the
right hand of God, the Catholike church;
the Cōmunion of Saints; the reſurrectiō
of the body; and the life everlaſting: did al
theſe therefore creepe in by negligēce?
I thinke not.
               
                  
                  
The Ancient Fathers were perſwaded
of the deſcenſion, as they were of
the other Articles which they left out.
But in that Counſell they chiefely hādled
the heriſie of Arrius cōcerning the
two natures of Chriſt, applying al their
ſaying in that Creed vnto the plague of
that time.
               
               The ſame Ancient father ſaith there:Ruffinus i
                        •
                      expoſit. Symbol.
                  but that hee deſcended into hell is evidently
foretolde in the Pſalmes, alleadging
certaine places, and a little after he
ſaith:1. Pet. 3. 1▪
                   
                  Peter alſo hath ſaid: for Chriſt
vvas mortified in the fleſh, but quickened
in the ſpirite, in which he went and
preached to the ſpirits alſo which vvere
ſhut vp in priſon in the daies of Noah,
in which text is declared what work he
did in hel. But the Lord himſelfe ſaith
by the Prophet,Pſal. 16. 1
                        •
                     
                   as of the time to come:
becauſe thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in
hell, neither vvilt thou ſuffer thine holy
one to ſee corruption. Which againe he
ſheweth prophetically to bee fulfilledPſal. 30. 
                        •
                     
                  
                  
when he ſaith: Lorde thou haſt led forth
my ſoule out of hell,
                  Pſal. 30. 4. 
                  thou haſt ſaved mee
from them which go downe into the lake.
Thus your Ruffinus expoundeth this
clauſe (he de ſcended into hell)
               
            
            
               WILLIAM PERKINS.
               
                   And it muſt not ſeeme ſtrange to any
that a worde or two in proceſſe of
time, ſhould creepe into the Creede.
               
                   Conſidering that the Originall Copies

in them ſundry varieties of readings &
words otherwhiles, which frō the margin
crept into the texte.
               
                   Nevertheleſſe conſidering that this
clauſe hath long cōtinued in the Creed
& that by the common conſent of the
Catholike Church of God, and that it
may carry a fit ſenſe▪ and expoſition, it
is not (as ſome would haue it) to be put
forth of the Creede.
               
                  
Therefore that we may come to the
meaning thereof; we muſt know that it 
hath foure vſual expoſitions, which we
will rehearſe in order, and then make
choiſe of that, which ſhall be thoughte
to be fitteſt.
               The firſt expoſition, is that Chriſtes 
ſoule after his paſſion vpon the croſſe
did really and locally deſcende into the
place of the damned. But this ſeemes
not to be true.
            
            
               IOHN HIGINS.
               It ſeemes both ſtrange and vnture.
For Irenaeus beleeued the ſame clauſe
1400. yeares ſince: Athanaſius Creede
had the ſame clauſe 1200 yeares ſince.
Chryſoſtome and Ruffinus expounded
the ſame 1100. yeares ſince: Fulgētius
beleeved the ſame aboue 1000. yeares
ſince, & it was in the prophetical Scriptures
aboue 1000. yeares before
Chriſt, and hath continued in the newe

Teſtament, And in the Creede 1550▪
yeares ſince Chriſt; & in this proceſſe
of aboue 1550 years theſe words crept
out of the Scriptures into the Creede▪
                   and yet they remaine in both ſtill.
               The olde and new Teſtaments in a
1000. pages, haue a fewe diverſe readings;
but the old and new ſcarſe 60 pages
of Creeds haue no ſuch ſundry readings
at all.Mat. 27. 9. But you note in your Margin
Ieremy put for Zacharie. Mat. 27.
9. Loe, thus is the text. Then was fulfilled,
that vvhich vvas ſaid by the Prophet
Ieremy,
                  Ierem. 36. 
                  ſaying,, &c. The holy
Ghoſt in S. Matthew knew who ſaid it,
ſaying, and who wrote it, writing. For
Zachary livedafter Ieremy and might
as Baruch &c. write that which Ieremy
ſpake or propheſied before him.
               It is neither to bee put foorth of our
Creede, not to be expounded by ſenſe,
becauſe it is a matter of faith.
               
                  
Theſe fowre expoſitions as in order
you place them, ſhall in order bee examined,
and refuted, or aunſwered: becauſe
as I take it they are handled amiſſe.
            
            
               The firſt expoſition.
               Chriſt deſcended into hell, that is,
Chriſt in his humane Soule after his
death, did really and locally, actuallie,
and effectually deſcend into hell where
the wicked are tormēted. This is a true
expoſition.
               
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  The reaſons why this firſt expoſition 
ſeemes not to be true are theſe.
                  All the Evangeliſtes and among the 
reſt S. Luke intending to make an exact
Narration of the life and death of
Chriſt,Iuke. 1. 3. haue ſet downe at large his Paſſion,
death, buriall, reſurrection, and aſcenſion,
and withall they make rehearſal

of ſmall circumſtances; therefore no
doubte they woulde not haue omitted
Chriſts Locall deſcenſion to the place
of the damned, if there had bin any ſuch
thing. And the ende why they penned
this hiſtorie,Iam. 20. 31. 
                     was that we might beleeue
that Ieſus is Chriſt the Sonne of God, and
that in beleeuing wee might haue life everlaſting.
                  
                  
                      Now there could not haue bin a greater
matter for the confirmation of our
faith then this, that Ieſus Chriſt the
ſon of Mary, who went downe to the
place of the damned, returned thence
to liue in happines for ever.
               
               
                  IOHN HIGINS
                  
                      The Reaſons why this firſt expoſitiō
is true are theſe.
                  
                      The Evangeliſts and eſpecially St.
Matthew,Mat. 12, 40. report that CHRIST who
is the truth it ſelfe,Math. 16. 4. prophetically ſpake

twice therof in the ſigne of Ionas. And
St. Luke ſaith, that the ſame truth told
after his Reſurrection,Luk. 23. 43. 
                     howe all muſt bee
fulfilled which were propheſied of him.
                     Acts. 2. 31.
St. Luke alſo reportes howe the holie
Ghoſt expoūdeth the prophecy of David,Epheſ. 4. 9. 10.
and againe St. Paule and St. Peter
ſpake thereof in their Epiſtles.1. Pet. 3. 18. 19. Aſſure
your ſelfe then there was ſuch a thing,
as in places fitte (God willing) ſhall
plainely appeare ere we end with this
our worke.
                  We muſt not then confute, but beleeue 
this great matter for the confirmatiō
of our faith, as the ſcriptures do
teach vs, Cōſidering that if he had not
in Soule deſcended, the Devil and the
damned might haue bragged of the
force of that their kingdome. But as
the 3.Dan. 3. 21. young men in the hoate Oven,
Daniel in the den of the Lions,Dan. 14. 30. and Ionas
in the belly of the Whale,Ioh. 2. 1. 2. 3. beeing
the ſignes and figures of CHRISTS
Deſcenſion, came forth without hurte:

ſo Chriſt from that furnace, from that
denne of the Lyon, from that belly of
hel, victoriouſly, as he deſcended, came
forth with valour, with freedome, with
triumph.
               
               
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  
                      The ſecond reaſon why this firſt expoſition
ſeemeth not to be true is this.
If Chriſt did goe to the place of the dā
                     ned,
then either in ſoule, or in body, or
in his godhead: but the godhead could
not deſcēd becauſe it was every where,
and his body was in the graue; And as
for his ſoule, it went not to hel, but preſently
after his death it went to Paradiſe,
that is, the third heaven, a place
of ioie and happineſſe.Luk. 23. 43. 
                     Luk. 23▪ 43. This
day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.
                  
                  
                      Which words of Chriſt muſt be vnderſtood
of his manhoode or ſoule, and
not of his godhead: for they are an anſwere
to a demande, and therefore vnto

it they muſt be ſutable.
                  Nowe the theefe ſeeing that Chriſt 
was firſt of al crucified, and therefore in
all likelyhoode ſhoulde firſt of all die;
maketh his requeſt to this effect: Lord
thou ſhalt ſhortly enter into thy kingdome,
remember me then.Luk. 23. 42. 43. To which
Chriſts anſwere (as the very words importe)
is thus much: I ſhall enter into
Paradiſe this day, and there ſhalt thou
bee with mee.
                  Now there is no entrance but in regard 
of his ſoule, or manhood. For the
godhead, which is at all times in al places,
cannot be ſaid properly to enter into
a place.
               
               
                  IOHN HIGINS.
                  Your ſecond reaſon ſtandes on this 
place: to day thou ſhalt bee with mee in
Paradiſe.
                     Luk. 23. 43. Chriſt ſpake this as God, who
only hath power to giue Paradiſe,Aug. lib. 11. confeſſ. ca. 13. in fine. and
whoſe to daie as Auguſtine ſaith is eternity:

and hee ſpeaketh it as man to
that happy mā, who after that evening
never ſince ſaw night nor darknes. For
they bleſſed departing hēce, haue their
evening at their death, and being dead
preſently ſee in ſoule the day ſpring viſiring
them from an high,Luk▪ 1. 78. of that to day
which after is nightleſſe. Then hee that
lookes for a ſublimary day of light and
darckneſſe, amongſt the bleſſed ſoules
in Paradiſe, is darkely deceived. For if
the theefes ſoule went that ſame night
to Paradiſe, as wee beleeue it did, yet
went it the ſame to day of Chriſtes eterne
nature, and was in Paradiſe the
ſame to day of Chriſts glorious humane
natures aſcēſiō, which with the theefe
was yet the ſame to day & laſteth nightleſſe
till now and for ever.
                  
                      Chriſt was not bounde by neceſſitie
of must, nor did in cuſtome ſuite everie
demaunde or petition with aunſwere.
For ſometimes hee queſtioned againe,
and ſometimes hee did not anſwere at

all. But to this petition he anſwered as
God and Man, and therefore your tvvo
muſts, aſſigning the ſame to the manhoode,
and cutting it of from the godheade,
are more then the ſcriptures allowe.
                  This ſuppoſition with the fiction of 
two Enters, interferres it ſelfe. For the
text is not ſo, but thus:Luk. 23. 42▪ 43. 
                     Lorde remember
me when thou commeſt into they kingdom.
And Ieſus ſaide vnto him: to day thou
ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. He ſpake
(ſaith Euthymius) as God which filleth
al,Euthymius ſuper hunc locum. and was togither every where; in the
Sepulcher, in hell, in Paradiſe, and in
heauen. Alſo if the ſoule of Chriſt was
in Paradiſe before his reſurrection, thē
it was not in the graue; if not in the
graue, then that tranſlation is falſe,
thou vvilte not leaue my ſoule in
graue.
                  
                  Now your concluding no entrance 
                     
with the fiction of two enters, interres
nothing. The texte of S. Luke is true,
yours is not ſo.
               
               
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  
                      Againe when Chriſt ſaith, thou ſhalt
bee with mee to day in Paradiſe,
                     Gen. 3. 7. hee doeth
intimate a reſemblaunce, vvhich
is betweene the firſt Adam, and the
ſecond Adam. The firſt Adam ſinned
and was preſently caſt out of Paradiſe.
                  
                      Chriſt the ſeconde Adam, having
made the ſatiſfaction for ſin, muſt immediatly
enter into Paradiſe.
                  
                      Now to ſay that Chriſt in ſoule deſcended
locally into hell, is to aboliſh
this Analogie, betweene the firſt, and
the ſecond Adam.
                  The ende of the ſecond reaſon.
               
               
                  
                  JOHN HIGINS.
                  In this matter there can be no reſemblaunce 
betweene them; for the firſt
Adam vvas not preſently caſt out of
paradiſe after his death, but nine hundred
yeares before he died, or was buried.
The ſecond Adam aſcended into
the heauenlye Paradiſe after his
death, buriall, deſcenſion and reſurrection.
The firſt Adam vvente out of
the earthly Paradiſe with a mortall body;
the ſeconde Adam went into the
heauenly with a glorified body. And
whoſoever will read Gen. 3.Gen. 3. 7. the 7. verſe,
and the verſes after (conſidering vvell
the particulars there) ſhal plainly perceiue,
that Adam was not preſently
caſt out (as you ſay) for that preſently is
not in the third of Geneſis.
                  Neither muſt Chriſt immediatly after 
ſatisfaction, &c. (as you ſay) enter
into Paradiſe; this immediately is not in

all the new Teſtament.
                  
                      Now to ſay that Chriſtes Soule deſcended
not into Hell, is to aboliſh the

And heereunto Chriſt anſwered,
that hee woulde giue them the ſigne of

takes it for graunted that hell is ſeated
in the middle of the earth; Wheras the
Scriptures reveale no ſuch thing, but
this, that hell is in the lower partes; but
where thoſe lower parts be, no man is
able to define.

                      Theſe words cannot proue any local
deſcent of Chriſts Soule.
                  
                      For Peters drift in all eadging this, is
to proue the reſurrection, and hee ſaith
expreſſely, that the words muſt be vnderſtoode
of the reſurrection of Chriſt.
What? namely theſe wordes, that his
ſoule was not left in hell.
                  
                     
Nowe there is no reſurrection of the
ſoule, but of the body only, as the ſoule 
cannot be ſaide to fall, but the body.

                  For Tyrus being an Iland foure furlongs,
or ſeavē hundred paſes from the
land,Ezec 27. 4. was therfore ſaide of God to haue

                     I am God, I ſit in the throne of God, in the
hart or middle of the ſeas.
                  
                  Theſe words of Chriſt: for as Ionas 
was 3. daies &c.Mat. 12. 40. 
                     ſo ſhall the Son of man
be 3. daies & 3. nights in the hart of the

                     neither ſuffer thine holy

things of which Chriſt ſaid,Luk. 24. 44. 
                     it behooved
all things to be fulfilled which are written
of me in the Lawe of Moſes, and in
the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes.
                  
                  
                      And if this Propheſie proue not the

ſaide: it behooved all things to bee fulfilled

                      Peter is plaine, he ſaith, David foreſeing

                     Act. 2. 31.
                     for why, his ſoule was not left in hel, neither
ſaw his fleſh corruption.
                  
                  
                      If your tranſlation or expoſition bee
true,Act. 2. 27.

then the perſon or the ſoule of Chriſt is
riſen, or els Chriſt is not riſen. And for
your fall, I aske firſt, whether it may be
ſaid, that chriſts body fel into the graue
ſecondly whether if it fel not, but was
buried therein, it may not yet be ſaid to
haue riſen; thirdly, whether Chriſt roſe
without a ſoule, becauſe it fell not into
the graue.Mat. 27. 52. For many bodies of Saintes
aroſe which fell not; neither did they ariſe
without ſoules, which ſoules yet fell
not into the granes▪ So I ſay, if nōe ariſe
at the laſt day, but the bodies of them
which fell, there wil be a very ſmall reſurrectiō
in reſpect of the whole number
of the departed.

                  It will be replied that the word

                      The firſt word, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſignifies not only
the ſpiritual parte of man,Rom. 13. 1. 1. Cor. 15. 45. i, the ſoule:
but alſo the whole perſon, or the man
himſelfe. Rom. 13. 1. 1. Cor. 15. 45.

his ſoule or perſon was not left in graue

And the word (

is not found in al the ſcriptures.
                  The word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      i. ſoule, ſometimes 
ſignifies the whole perſon,Act. 2. 41. the man a

                     and there vvere

ſoules:
                     1. Cor. 15. 45. 
                     let every ſoule ſubmitte it ſelfe to
the authority of the higher povvers: the
firſt man Adam vvas made a living
ſoule,
                     Geneſ. 27. theſe were not whole perſons of
dead men buried, but Chriſtians newly
converted, and Romane ſubiects aliue.
So Adam was made a living ſoule, but
he was not ſo buried; the whole perſon
ſo ſignified by 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , was not buried in
hell.Luk. 23. 43. If it were, then by theſe texts, (to
day ſhalt thou be vvith mee in Paradiſe;
thou wilt not leaue my perſon in hell;
                     Act. 2. 27. 31. and
his ſoule was not left in graue) the whole
perſon was in Paradiſe, in hell, & in the
graue the ſame day that hee was buried.
                  
                     
The ſecond word, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , hel, is not taken
 for the graue or toomb of the dead;
the text truely tranſlated is thus: death
and hell vvere ſent into the lake of fire,
                     Apoc. 20. 14
                     this is the ſecond death▪ And whoſoever
was not founde vvritten in the booke of

there be two diſtinct partes; the firſt of
the ſoules comming foorth of hell in
theſe words: thou wilt not leaue my ſoule
in hell. And the ſecond of the body riſing
out of the graue, in the next words
following: Neither wilt thou ſuffer my
fleſh to ſee corruption. It is not ſo.
                  For the fleſh in this place ſignifieth 
not the body alone, but the humane
nature of Chriſt:Act. 2. 30. 31 as appeareth Act. 2.

And the words rather cary this ſenſe;
thou wilt not ſuffer me to cōtinue long
in the grane; nay which is more, in the
time of my cōtinuance there, thou wilt
not ſuffer me ſo much as to ſee corruption,
becauſe I am thy holy one.

the two parts & places of Chriſts humanity

So alſo Peter interpreteth,Fulgen. lib. 3. ad Thraſimund. 
                     Act. 2. 31.

                      In the firſt, 30. verſe, Peter explaines
a Prophecy of the regall humane generation
of Chriſt thus:Act. 2. 30. 
                     he then, that is,
David, ſith he was a Prophet, and knewe
that God had ſworn vnto him by an othe,
of the fruit of his loines, according to the

fleſh, to raiſe vp the Chriſt, that he might
place him on his ſeate.
                     Pſal. 3. 32. 11. Here the Apoſtle
addeth (according to the fleſh,) to diſtinguiſh
and to tell vs, that the ſoule is not
ex traduce; but that the fleſh & it be of
different natures, which immediatly after
(expounding the other prophecy)
he clearely explaines thus. 31. verſ. David
foreſeeing ſpake of the reſurrection
of Chriſt,
                     Act. 2. 31. 
                     that his ſoule was not le
                           •
                        t in
hell, neither did his fleſh ſee corruption.
                     Pſal. 16. 10.
There in the 30. verſ. Peter ſpake of the
fleſh (not of the ſoule) generated: and
here in the 31. of the fleſh & of the ſoul
ſeperated by death. In both yet by fleſh,
meaning one & the ſame fleſh of chriſt.
                  S. Peters words are of credit enough:
                     a rather carriage of ſēſe, comes to late.

                     1. Pet. 3. 18. 19. Gen. 6. 3.Obiect. 3. Chriſt was quickned in the
                     
                     ſpirit,
                     1. Pet. 3. 18. 19. 
                     by the which ſpirit he went & preached
vnto the ſpirits which are in priſō.
                  
                  
                     
                      Anſwere. This place is not for this
purpoſe, for by the ſpirit is not meant
the ſoule of Chriſt, but his godhead
which in the miniſtery of Noe preached
repentance to the old world.
                  
                      And I thinke that Peter in this place
alludes to another in Geneſis 6. 3.
where the Lord ſaith, my ſpirit ſhall not
alwaies striue vvith man, becauſe hee is
but fleſh.
                  
                  
                      And if the ſpirit do ſignifie the ſoule,
then Chriſt was quickened in his ſoule,
or by his ſoule, but neither is true.

                     1. Pet. 3. 18. Geneſ. 6. 3.We muſt not alledge, nor take the
text lamely. It is thus: for Chriſt once
ſuffered for ſins, the iuſt for the vniuſt,
that he might bring vs to God,
                     1. Pet. 3. 18. 19. 
                     hee vvas
mortified in the fleſh, but was quickened
in the ſpirite, in which ſpirite hee vvent
and preached vnto the ſpirites vvhich
are in priſon. Heere is the ſuffering of

Chriſt, his death, immortality of ſoule,
with the deſcenſion therof, and (as Ruffinus
ſaith) what worke it did in hell.Ruffinus in Symbol.
                  
                  And therfore this place is pregnant 
for the deſcenſion. For by the ſpirite is
mēt the ſoule of Chriſt, & not his godhead
(as you ſay.) For then your texte
ſhould be thus: Chriſt was quickened in
the godhead, by which godhead hee went
and preached to the ſpirites which are in
priſon, which you ſaid in Noe preached
to the old world. But this cannot be; it
was after Chriſtes mortification in the
fleſh, not in the olde world but in that
which is nowe.
                  That which is ſaide in Geneſis 6. 3.Geneſ. 6. 3.
                     
                     my ſpirit ſhall not alwaies contend vvith
man, becauſe he is but fleſh, and his daies
ſhall be an hundred & twenty yeares was
fiftie generations before Chriſt, this in
Peter was after Chriſts death; that was
in ſpirit divine, this was in the ſoule humane;
that was on earth with men in

the fleſh; this was in hel with the ſpirits
of the dead; Peter therfore in this place
alludes not to that in Geneſis.

                     1 Pet. 3. 19. 1. Pet. 4. 6.For the firſt, it cannot be ſaide, that
Chriſt was quickened by his ſoule, becauſe
it did not ioyne it ſelfe vnto the
body; but the Godhead ioyned thē both.
                  
                      Neither was he quickened in ſoule.
For the ſoule died not. It could not die
the firſt death, which belongeth to the
body; & it did not die the ſecond death,
which is a total ſeperation from God.
Onely it ſuffered the ſorrowes of the ſecond
death, which is the apprehenſion
of the wrath of God, as a man may feele
the panges of the firſt death, & yet not
die the firſt death, but liue.
                  
                     
Againe, it is to no end that Chriſtes 
Soule, ſhould goe to hel to preach.
                  Conſidering it was never heard of,
that one ſoul ſhould preach to another,
eſpecially in hel, where al are condemned,
& in conſcience cōvicted to their
iuſt damnation; and where there is no
hope of repentance, or redemption.

                     1. Pet. 3, 19. 1. Pet. 4. 6.To ſay that Chriſt was quickened by 
his ſoule, is to reaſon vpon no text, and
ſo we leaue it. So was the deſcenſion of
Chriſt alſo.
                  Chriſt was mortified in the fleſh, but 
he was quickened in the ſpirite, that is,
in ſoule; not that it died, but that in anguiſh
it ſuffered the ſorrowes of death
which cōpaſt his body.Pſal. 18. 5. And therfore he
ſaid:Mat. 26. 38. 
                     my ſoule is very ſad evē to the death.
But when that death was paſt, the ſorrow,
anguiſh, & ſadnes were ended; and

the ioy, the comforte and ſolace which
his ſoule immediately after receiued,
may very fitlie be named, a reviving or
quickening. And of this reviving or
quickning al the bleſſed ſouls departed
haue preſently after this life, a ioyful &
moſt happy feeling.
                  
                      There is an end why Chriſt went &
preached in hell, and why Peter wrote
that he preached there. We muſt beleeue
the word, though wee knowe not
the ende.
                  
                      Conſidering it was ever hearde of,
ſince Chriſts time, that the ſoule of Abraham
had a ſpeech with the ſoule of
the rich man in hell,Luk. 16. 25. and tolde him his
owne, and beſides how that his brethrē
had Moſes and the Prophets, &c. And
the borne blind ſaid: It was neuer heard
of,
                     Io. 9. 32. 
                     that any man opened the eies of one
that was borne blinde. But yet the cure
was to ſome end, & ſo was the deſcenſion
of Chriſt alſo.
               
               
                  
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  It wil bee anſwered that this preaching 
(whereof Peter ſpeaketh. 1. Pet. 3.
19.) is only reall or experimentall, becauſe
Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe there to
convince the vnbeliefe of his enemies.
                  But this is flat againſt reaſon. For 
when a man is iuſtly condemned by
God, and therefore ſufficiently convicted;
what neede the Iudge himſelfe
come to the place of execution to convict
him?
                  And it is flat againſt the text. For the 
preaching ſpokē of here (1. Pet. 3. 19.) is
that which is performed by men in the
miniſtery of the word, as Peter expoū
                     deth
himſelfe elſewhere (1. Pet. 4. 6.) to
this purpoſe alſo was the Goſpell preached
to the dead, that they might bee condemned
according to men in the fleſh; but
that they might line according to God in
the ſpirite.
                  
               
               
                  
                  JOHN HIGINS.
                  
                     
                     1. Pet. 3. 19.The preaching of Chriſt in hell, was
real; that is, in re, indeed: not experimē
                     tal,
as to proue an experiment, or concluſiō.
For al the propheſies muſt needs
be fulfilled, ſo as the Councel of God
decreed, and as the Scriptures reporte.
It was then a powerful paſſage, in his
ſin-leſſe ſoules, freedome and valour; for
ſo he went to conquer the devil, and to
confound the damned in hel, from
whence he returned with triumphant
victory.
                  
                      But theſe matters of faith are not to
bee meaſured by the ſhallow flattes of
reaſon?
                     
                        
                           •
                        ſal. 135. 6. for al thinges vvhatſoever the
Lord would, that did be in heaven, and in
earth, and in the ſea, & in all deepe places.
This prerogatiude Iudge might go
where he would, and convict whom he
liſt, hee could bee no more exempted
from hel, then hee could bee payned

thereby, or detained therein.
                  Theſe two texts are not flat of one nature▪ 
                     
For there in 1. Pet. 3▪ 19. the ſpirit
of Chriſt went and preached to the ſpirites
in hel: here in 1. Pet. 4. 6. the Goſpel
is ſaide to be preached to the deade
&c. that is to the Gentiles or 
                        •
                     entilized

hee ſaide, let the deade bury their dead▪

                     Hee deſcended into the graue.Laſtly there is no reaſon why Chriſt 
ſhould rather preach & ſhew himſelfe
in hel to them that were diſobedient in
the daies of Noe; then to the reſt of the
damned.
                  And this is the firſt expoſition
The ſecond followeth.
               
               
                  
                  IOHN HIGINS.
                  
                     He deſcended into hell.If we ſhal runne from faith to no reaſon,
I wil conferre like reaſon with your
reaſon thus:Luk. 16. 25. there is no reaſon why Abraham
ſhould rather ſhew himſelfe to
the rich glutton in hell, then to the reſt
of the damned; this is as wiſe a reaſō as
that. But all thinges are poſſible to him
that beleeveth. The text is, hee went in
ſpirite,
                     Math. 9. 23. 
                     and preached to the ſpirits which
are in priſon. And this the faithfull beleeue,
becauſe it is Scripture; and they
beleeue the deſcēſion, becauſe they are
Chriſtians.
               
               And thus much touching the
firſt expoſition. The ſecond
followeth.
            
            
               
                  
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  The ſecond vſuall expoſition of this 
clauſe (he deſcended into hell) is, that
Chriſt deſcēded into the graue, or was
buried.
                  This expoſition is agreeable to the 
truth, yet it is not meete or convenient.
For the clauſe next before (he was buried)
contained this point, and therfore
if the next words following yeelde the
ſame ſenſe, there muſt bee a vaine and
needleſſe repetition of one & the ſame
thing twice; which is not to be allowed
in ſo ſhort a Creede as this.
                  If it be ſaide, that, theſe words are an 
expoſition of the former; the aunſwere
is, that then they ſhould be more plaine
then the former. For when one ſentēce
expoūdeth another, the latter muſt alwaies
be the plainer. But of theſe two
ſentēces: he was buried; he deſcended into
hel: the firſt is very plaine & eaſy, but

the latter very obſcure and hard.
                  
                      And therefore it can be no expoſition
thereof, and for this cauſe this expoſition
neither is to be receiued.
                  And thus endeth the 2. expoſitiō
                  
               
               
                  IOHN HIGINS.
                  
                      If Chriſt deſcended into the graue,
it was in his body aliue: for to deſcend is
a liuely action. This cannot ſtand with
the Scriptures, for all the Evangeliſtes
ſay,Mat. 27. 50. 
                     he yeelded vp the Ghoſt, & alſo they
ſay,Mar. 15. 37. he was taken downe & was ſhrowded
& buried in a new ſepulcher by Joſeph
of Arimathea,Luk. 23. 46. &c. his body could
not deſcende except it were aliue, and
they would not haue buried it,
                        
                           •
                        o. 19▪ 30. if he had
not beene dead.
                  
                      That ſeconde expoſition then is not
agreeable to the word: and as you ſay
it is not meete nor convenient, ſo ſay I,

becauſe it is falſe. For it makes a vaine
and needleſſe repetition of one thing
twice, &c. Wherefore it is not to be allowed
nor liked of.
                  His buriall was ſenſible, it was done 
and ſeene here on earth, his deſcenſion
was an inviſible action of the immortal
ſoule perfourmed in hel, only comprehended
by faith, not by ſenſe, nor by
reaſon, and therefore (as you ſay) this
ſeconde expoſition is not to bee receiued,
as expounding the burial, and in
this we ſomewhat agree.
               
               And thus much touching the
ſecond expoſition, now followeth
the third.
            
            
               
               
                  WILL. PERKINS.
                  
                     
                     vpō the croſſe Chriſt dyinge felt & ſuffered the pangs of hell & the full wrath of God.Thirdly others there bee who expounde
it thus, hee deſcended into hel,
that is, Chriſt Ieſus when he was dying
vpon the Croſſe felte and ſuffered the
pangs of hel, and the full wrath of God
ſeazing vpon his Ioule.
                  
                      This expoſition hath his warrant in
Gods word, where hell oftentimes ſignifieth
the ſorrowes and paines of hel.
                  
                      As Hanna in her ſong to the Lorde
ſaith:1. Sam. 2. 6. 
                     the Lord killeth and maketh aliue,
and he bringeth downe to hell & raiſeth
vp againe. That is, he maketh men feele
woe and miſery in their ſoules even the
pangs of hell, and after reſtoreth them.
And David ſaith:Pſal. 88. 5. 
                     the ſorrowes of death
compaſſed me, and the terrours of hel laid
hold on me. This is an vſuall expoſition

received in the Church, & they which
expounde this Article thus, giue this
reaſon thereof. The former words, was
crucified, dead, and buried, doe containe
(ſay they) the outwarde ſuffrings of
Chriſt. Now becauſe hee ſuffered not
only outwardly in body, but alſo inwardly
in ſoule; therefore theſe words,
he deſcended into hell, doe ſet forth vnto
vs his inward ſufferings in ſoule, whē
he felt vpon the croſſe the pangs of hel
and the ful wrath of God ſeazing vpon
him.
                  This expoſition is good and true, & 
whoſoeuer wil, may receiue it; yet nevertheleſſe
it ſeemeth not ſo fitly to agree
with the order of the former Articles.
For theſe wordes: was crucified,
dead, & buried, muſt not be vnderſtood
of any ordinary death, but of a curſed
death, in which Chriſt ſuffered the full
wrath of God, even the pangs of hell,
both in ſoule and body.
                  Seeing then this expoſition is contained

in the former wordes; it cannot
fitly ſtande with the order of the ſhorte
Creede, vnleſſe there ſhoulde bee a diſtinct

                  And thus endeth the 3. expoſition.
               
               
                  IOHN HIGINS.
                  
                      We muſt hold that Ieſus Chriſt the
ſonne of God, dying vpon the croſſe,
could neither feele not ſuffer the pangs
of hel, nor the ful wrath of God ſeazing
vpon his ſoule; becauſe it was neither
ſeperated from the godhead; nor ſubiect
vnto ſin; and alſo becauſe that laying
downe his life, he vſed theſe wordes
of deliuery:Luk. 23. 46. 
                     Father into thy handes I cō
                        mende
my ſpirite. By which wee vnderſtand,
that hee was then ſeazed and did
poſſeſſe his owne ſoule, and yeelded the
poſſeſſion and ſeazen thereof vnto his
father, and neither the devill, nor the
pangs of hel had any ſeazen, holde, intereſt,

or poſſeſſion therein.
                  This expoſition, that Chriſt after his 
death deſcended into hell in ſoule, hath
many warrants in the old teſtament, of
which one is in theſe words of Hanna:
the Lorde mortifieth and quickeneth; hee 
cauſeth to deſcende into hell and cauſeth
to aſcend.
                     1. Sam. 2. 6. And this was a prophecie of
the death, deſcenſion, reſurrection, and
aſcenſion of Chriſt. So the ſaide Hanna
in the 10. verſe after prophecied of the
kingdome of Chriſt alſo thus:verſ. 10. 
                     Iehovah
will iudge the endes of the earth; and hee
will giue fortitude to his king, & he will
exalt the horne of his Chriſt. And David
ſaith:Pſal. 18. 5. 
                     the ſorrows of death compaſſed me,
and the land flowdes of vngodlines made
me afraide. Theſe were the ſorrowes of
the firſt death in the fleſh, and not the
pangs of hel, which ſeaze only vpon the
wicked, but not on the iuſt.
                  
                     He was crucified, deade, and buried▪
                     
                     
theſe were of his paſſion, cōcerning the

body mortal, and did not (but in his
death) concerne the ſoule. For neither
could the Iewes hurt it, neither coulde
Ioſeph bury it: but theſe, hee deſcended
into hell; he roſe againe from the dead, he
aſcended into heaven, are actions perfourmed
by Chriſt, the firſt in his ſoule,
and the other two in his whole humane
triumphing nature.
                  
                     
                     The death of his holy ones, or of his mercifull
mē,
                     Pſal. 116. 13 
                     is precious in the ſight of God:
God then is not wroth with them, neither
doth he inflict the pangs of hel vpon
them, much leſſe vpon his moſt holy,
vpō his moſt iuſt one. In theſe words
of S. Peter. Act. 2. 23. 24. hunc interemistis,
there is the death,Act. 2. 23. 24. 
                     quem Deus ſuſcitavit
ſolutis doloribus Inferni, there is
the reſurrection from hel and from the
ſepulcher. Theſe places plainly demonſtrate
that the Apoſtle ſpake of that
which Chriſt ſuffered and did in his
death, buriall, deſcenſion, &c. and that
his deſcenſion was not before his death

but after, Ergo Christus non reſurrexit
ab inferno ante mortem ſuam: and alſo
Peeter expoundeth it even ſo in theſe
words: Providens (David) locutus eſt de
reſurrectione Chriſti; quia ne
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         derelicta
eſt anima eius in inferno, &c.
                  
               
               Thus much touching the 3. expoſition.
Now followeth the 4. and laſt.
            
            
               
                  WILLIAM PERKINS.
                  But let vs come to the fourth expoſition.
                     Hee deſcended into hell, that is,
when he was dead and buried, hee was
held captiue in the graue, and lay in bō
                     dage
vnder death for the ſpace of three
daies. This expoſition alſo may bee gathered
forth of the ſcriptures.Act. 24. So Peter
ſaith, God hath raiſed him vp (ſpeaking
of Chriſt) and looſed the ſorrowes of
death, becauſe it was impoſsible that hee
ſhould be holden of it.
                  
                  Where we may ſee, that betweene 
                     
the death & the reſurrection of Chriſt,
there is placed a third matter, which is
not mentioned in any clauſe of the Apoſtles
Creede ſaue in this; and that is
his bondage vnder death, which commeth
in betweene his death and his riſing
againe, and the words themſelues
doe moſt fitly beare this ſenſe.
                  
                      As the ſpeech of Iacob ſheweth.Gen. 37. 53. death or the graue. 
                     I
wil go down into hel to my ſon mourning.
                  
                  
                      And this expoſition doth alſo beſt agree
with the order of the Creede. Firſt
he was crucified and died; ſecondly hee
was buried; thirdly laid in the graue and
was therein holden in captivity & bondage
vnder death. And theſe three degrees
of Chriſtes humiliation are moſt
fitly correſpondent to the 3. degrees of
his exaltation. The firſt degree of his
exaltation; [he roſe again the third day]
anſwering to the firſt degree of his humiliation
[he died] the 2. degree of his
exaltation; [hee aſcended into heaven,]
                     
anſwering to his going into the graue,
or he was buried. And thirdly his ſitting
at the right hand of God (which is the
higheſt degree of his exaltation) anſwering
to the loweſt degree of his humiliation,
he deſcended into hell.
                  
                  Theſe two laſt expoſitions are commonly 
receiued, & we may indifferently
make choiſe of either. But the laſt (as
I take it) is moſt agreeable to the order
and words of the Creede.
                  Thus endeth the 4. expoſition.
               
               
                  IOHN HIGINS
                  Chriſt was buried and deſcended into 
hel: but in the graue his body was
free from paine, free from bondage, and
free from corruption: and his ſoule in
hel was free from torments; free from
bondage, and free from detention. He
was captiue to neither of both, though
hee would for a time bee contained of
both, who in his divine nature cōtaines

all, and cannot at all be contained. So
we find that Chriſt was free among the
dead▪
                     
                     Aſal. 88. 6. 
                     whom God hath raiſed vp, looſing
the ſorrowes of hell,
                     Act. 2. 24. 
                     becauſe it vvas impoſſible
he ſhould bee holden of it.

was it impoſſible? becauſe he is free, &
becauſe the gates of hel cānot prevaile
againſt his church, much-leſſe againſt
himſelfe which is the head thereof.
                  
                      In the graue then & in hel, he would
be for 3. daies & 3. nights without corruption
and torments; to declare his
mortality, his immortality & his innocē
                     cy.
But the body did not deſcend, it was
buried in the ſepulcher: the ſoul deſcended
into hell, it was not buried in the
graue. And this deſcenſion was after
his death and before his reſurrection.
And this was an Acte of his freedome,
the other of freedome in patience, and
both were in prophecy and in promiſe.
                  
                      That which Iacob propheticallie
ſpake of his own deſcēſion into Aegypt,Gen. 37. 53
and of Chriſts deſcenſion into hell well

weighed by the ſtate of the Church in
Aegypte,Luk. 16. 25. and by the ſpeech of his granſire
Abraham in bliſſe, & by the nature
of the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is not ſo full of queſtion
as men doe make it.
                  Wherfore the beſt expoſitiō agrees
beſt with the order of the Creede thus:
firſt he was crucified by the Iews: ſecōdly
he died when he gaue vp the ghoſt;
thirdly he was buried by Ioſeph of Arymathea
&c. fourthly he deſcēded into
hel, that was in ſpirit, or ſoule: fiftly the
third day he roſe againe frō the dead, &
ſixtly he aſcended into heaven &c. but
your ſecondly he was buried, and thirdly
laide in the graue, make two burials.
                  Thus haue I briefely delivered, what
I thought meete to be ſaid, concerning
the deſcenſion of Chriſt into hel. In all
which I referre my ſelfe to the iudgmēt
of thoſe who may & can beſt deſcerne
of theſe matters, as by the word of God,
and her Maieſties Lawes I am bound.
