            THE THREE FRIERS OF BERWICKE.
            
               AS it befell, and happened in déede,
            Upon a River, which is called Twéede:
            At Twéedes faire Mouth, there standes a Noble Towne,
            Where manie Lordes have béene, of great Renowne:
            And manie a worthie Ladie, fayre of Face:
            And manie a fresh lustie Gallant was:
            Into this Towne, which called is Berwicke,
            Upon the Sea there standeth none it like.

            The foure Orders of Friers were not to séeke,
            ¶ These Friers were in Berwicks Town once dwelling,
            Where as it hapned in a fayre May Morning,
            That two of the Iacobine Milke-whyte Friers,
            As they were wont, and used manie yeares,
            To walke amongst their Brethren up on Land.
            Those sillie Friers passed foorth from hand.
            Fri

                Allane was one: Frier Robert the other:
            As Friers fashion is, with Wyves could well gloother.
            Right wonderous well they pleased the Wyves:
            And tolde them fayre Tales, of Holie Sainctes lyves:
            Till Night was at hand, and they should goe home.
            But right tyred, and wet, was Frier Allane.
            For hée was olde, and might not well travell,
            Because hee had some spyce of the Gravell.
            Frier Robert was young, could byde Raine and Winde:
            H
                  •
               e bare both their Gownes, yet bode not behinde.
            Yea, bore all their Geare: 
                  •
               or hee was full wight.
            By that it drew neare towardes the Night:
            And they were comming to the Towne full neare.
            Frier Allane sayde, Robert, good Brother deare,
            It is so late, I feare the Yate bee closed:
            And wee are tyrde, and wondrous ill disposed
            To

               ¶ So there did dwell a wondrous good Hostl
                  •

                  ••
               
            
            Without Berwicke, in-to a fayre Manniere:
            Simon Lawrell hee called was by name:
            A fayre blythe Wyfe hee had, and comelie Dame:
            But shee was something duike, and dangerous.
            These sillie Friers came then to that Mans House;
            Saluting her: and becked courteouslie:
            And shee to them did answere perfectlie.
            Frier Robert then inquirde for the Good-man?
            And in this wyse shee quicklie answered than:
            Hee went from Home, GOD wots, on Wedn
                  •
               sday,
            In the Countrey, to seeke for Corne and Hay,
            And other thinges, where-of wee stand in neede.
            Frier Allane 
                  •
               ayde, I pray Great GOD him speede,
            And keepe him safe and sound in his travaile.
            Frier Robert sayde, Dame fill a Stoupe with Aile,
            That wée may drinke: for I am wondrous drye.
            With that the Good-wyfe went full spéedilye,
            And filde the Stoupe, and brought them Bread and Chiese
                  •
               
            
            They ate, and dranke, and sate at their owne ease.
            Frier Allane sayde to the Good-wyfe in hye,
            Come hither, Dame, and set you downe mee by,
            And fill once againe the Stoupe, I you pray,
            Before wee goe full well wee will you pay.
            The Friers were blythe, and merrie Tales 
                  •
               ould tell.
            But even with that they heard their owne Prayer Bell,
            Within the Abbie, and were sore agast,
            For then they knew the Yates were closed fast,
            That they might not from thence-foorth get entrie.
            The Good-wyfe then they prayde for Charitie,
            To graunt them Lodging, on
                  •
               lie for one night.
            But shee to them did aunswere high on hight,
            Mine Husband is from Home, as I you tolde:
            And I, GOD knowes, dare no wayes bee so bolde,
            To harber Friers within the House with mee.

            ¶ The Good-wyfe looked on those Friers tway,
            And at the last unto them did shee say:
            Yee byde not heere, by Him that hath us coft,
            Except yee list to lye up in yonde Loft,
            Which is well wrought even in-to the Halles ende:
            Yee shall finde Straw, and Cloathes I shall you sende.
            If yee list not, then passe your wayes in feire:
            None other wayes will I repaire you hee

               ade them follow both, and stay no more.
            ¶ They were full blythe, and did as shee them kende,
            And up they went, to lodge at the Halles ende.
            Intill a Loft, the Mayde with Corne and Hay,
            Did make their Bedde: and then shee went her way,
            Closing the Trappe: and they remayned still.
            In to that Lo
                  •
               t they had not all their will.
            Frier Allane lay downe, as hee best might.
            Frier Robert sayde, I vowde to walke this Night:
            Who wots? perchance some Sportes I may espye.
            Thus in the Loft I let the Friers lye,
            ¶ And of the Good-wyfe nowe will I spea

            For shee had made a Tryst that selfe-same Night,
            Frier Iohn her Love his Supper for to dight.
            
               And shee would have none other Companye,
            Because Frier Iohn that Night with her should lye:
            Who dwelling was in-to that selfe-same Towne:
            And a Blacke Frier hee was, of great Renowne.
            ¶ Hee governed all whole the Abbacie:
            Silver and Golde hee had aboundantlie.
            Hee had a privie Posterne of his owne,
            That hee might ishe, and passe away unknowne
            But thus in Berwickes Towne I leave him still,
            Byding his tyme: and turne againe I will,

            And éeke fatte Conies to the Fyre shee say:
            And bade her Mayden, in all haste shee may,
            To flame, and turne, and roast them tenderlye:
            Then to her Chamber is shee gone in hye.
            ¶ Shee pulde her Makin, gave it buffets tway
            Upon the Cheeke: and till it can shee say,
            Thou shouldst bee blythe, and gladde at my Request:
            These Mulles of thine are called to a Feast.
            Shee putteth on a Kirtle fyne of Redde:
            A fayre whyte Courtch shee bindes about her Head.
            Her Belt was wrought of Silke, and Silver fyne:
            Embrodred Purse: her Keyes hung clincking syne.
            On everie Finger shee put on Ringes two:
            And was as proude as anie Papingo.
            Shee layde on a Board-cloath of costlie Greene:
            Of Silver-Worke shee was full well fore-séene.
            Then foorth shee came, in-to the Hall, anone,
            And askt her Mayde, if shee heard anie one?
            ¶ With that Frier Iohn was knocking at the Yate:
            Whose knocke shée knew, and quicklie him in let.
            Shée well-comde him upon a good manniere.

            Foure Partriches, I know there is no lesse:
            Of Ploovers, Dame, see that yee bring a messe.
            The Good-wyfe saw Rob made no variance:
            She knew that hee had seene her governance.
            And thought it was no boote for to denye,
            But quicklie went un-to the Panterye:
            Then shee brought foorth, together with her Mayde,
            All that the Frier before un-to her sayde:
            Starting abacke, as shee were in effray:
            Then crost her-selfe, and smyling can shee say,
            Ha, Benedicitie, who hath heere beene?
            Or who hath ever such lyke Marvels seene?
            So great a wonder is now hapned heere:
            UUhat shall I say? hee is an holie Frier.
            I finde it sooth 
                  〈◊〉
                all that hee did say:
            Mayde, take all foorth, and on the Boarde it lay.

            Partriches, Ploovers, to the Board shee brought.
            Frier Rob knew all, and saw there wanted nought:
            But all was sooth, shee brought at his devyse.
            When Simon saw it happened on this wyse,
            Hee had much wonder, and sware by the Moone,
            That Frier Robert full well his déede had doone.
            Thou art, quod hee, a Man of great Science,
            That hast so soone made thus great Purveyance.
            Thou bringest heere, through thy great Subtiltie,

            In full good time it was, that thou came hither.
