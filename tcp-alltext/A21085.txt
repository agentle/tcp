            To the Reader.
            TO thy frendly acceptance,
(gētle Reader) more boldly
then aduisedly, I haue
offred here y• vnripe fruits
of my barren orchard, the
bitter taste wherof, is more liker to annoy
thy sugred lippes, then please thy
longing minde. But see as by diligent
searche, the labouring Bee fyndes the
wholsome honie amydst the infectiue
hearbe: So maiest thou (if thou list indifferently
to reade, and carefullye to
marke) happe the sage aduise of good
counsell, and learne by others mischiefs
to shunne thine owne decay. Thou knowest
within the harde shell shrowdeth
the sweet curnell, and amongst pricking
thornes the fragrant Rose is fostred,
within the hard flint (they say) the precious
Diamound is found, & amongst

               perfectnes of my rude vers, the
force of treason is showed and his iuste
desert. If thou canst by falshood learne

to shunne disceite, I haue my wish, and
thou happy. If iuste reuenge for foule
oaence can admonish thee to serue God,
obey thy Prince, no doubt, but thou shalt
liue an honest life, and die thrise blessed.
            Through twoo fieldes thy waye is
directed, the one full of briars, hath the
perfect path to felicitie: the other (more
pleasant to the vicious minde) leades
to endles miserie: choose with aduise,
and shunne with discretion. And to me
thy vnknowen friend, lende (I praye
thee, as fr

            Ariodanto, and Ieneura.
            AMongst the vanquisht Regions,
            that worthy brute did winne:
            There is a soyle in these our dayes,
            with Occean Seas cloasde in.
            That fertile is, and peopled well,
            and stord with pleasant fieldes:
            And hath for tillage lucky land,
            that yeerly profit yeeldes.
            Within y• land sometime ther dwelt
            a King of noble fame:
            whose actes wer such, as gaind to him
            an euerlasting name.
            Who, when he Cepter long had held
            and ruled his realme with right:
            In quiet rest, in spight of foe,
            and force of friendles might.
            Did take to wife a noble Dame,
            of egall Parentage:
            Of bewty great, of vertues more,
            and of a youthfull age.
            By whom he had a Daughter fayre,
            that 
                  •
               oyed his aged yeares:
            And plesure great at length did bring
            vnto his hoary heares.
            This child as tune gan passe frō her,
            so bewty doth increase:
            And as in yeeres she gan to grow
            so vertues to her prease.

            full fraught with courtly grace:

            or pleasde more eche sight.
            For proufe behould how swift report

            of eche estate is scand.
            The Kings that ioyne vnto her syre,

                séeke her grace to winne:
            The Ladies eke that vertues loue,
            to serue her grace beginne.
            But see farre of in Italie
            this Ladies name is blown:
            And ther her gifts of n
                  •
               turs art,
            to all are liuely known.
            Where at that time two gentlemen
            of honest family:
            Italians both by birth and bloud
            and brothers there did lie.
            The eldest namd Lurcanio,
            that speare and sheld desird:
            The other eke Ariodant,
            that more to loue aspierd.
            These two y• long had liued at home,
            and loth
                  •
                with Idle life:
            And moued eke with this report,
            that euery where is rife.
            
               Are now agréed to leaue this ease,
            theyr frendes and natiue soyle:
            And minde to seke aduentures farre
            with wery trauels toyle.
            And therfore first their land they sel,
            for present paiment tould:
            And other goods they do conuert,
            (for cariage light) to gould.
            This don, their busines eke dispatcht
            and heuy parting past:
            From wailing friends that wo their wil,
            they leaue the towne at last.
            And passe y• mountainshie vnknown
            and seke the desert dales:
            And scape by guyde the raggy rocks
            and tread the trodden vales.
            Thus when theyr werie steps had scapte,
            a thousand daungers past:
            And that they néedes must leaue the land,
            and yeld to sayle and mast.
            To Neptunes wil they doo commit
            them selues, and then do pray:
            The maister for to guide his shippe,
            to Scottish Realme the way.
            So said, he kéepes his bidden course,
            and hath a gale at will:
            The mariner at case also,
            his part doth well fulfill.
            So long these werie trauelers,
            are tost with sea and winde:
            That now the long desired port,
            and wyshed soyle they finde.
            
               Then nought there is but hale and pull,
            the Ancars are out cast:
            The maister hath his earned hyre,
            and prayes their life longe last.
            This don, the brothers aske the way
            that leadeth to the Court:
            wheras the noble king of Scottes,
            doth kéepe his Royall port.
            Which known, with speede they séeke to sée,
            and in theyr

            The fight wherof had forst them run
            a wery wandring race.
            Thus are these straungers happely,
            arriued at the Court,
            Wheras this péerles Dame abides,
            of whome ringes this report.
            There walke they forth with comly grace
            and enter in the hall,
            Where after greating, they declare,
            what chaunce had them befall.

            What harme mought lightly him ensue,
            if such he should retaine,
            As vnder cloke of frendship, mought

            doth ponder in his braine
            Long tyme, and in these doughtfull fitts,
            he silent doth remaine.
            Yet mindes he not to let them part,
            till what they would were knowen:
            And till the cause of their ariue,
            were plainely to him showen.
            
               Wherfore he doth bid call to him,

            Which message done, these brothers two,
            as men nothing dismaied:
            To speake before the Emperour,
            whom earst they had obeied.

            Wher we abode consuming time
            in drousie idelnes:
            And spending aye our youthful yeres
            in irksum quietnes.

            To serue your highnes faithfully,
            and loyall to remaine:
            Til death we minde. This forst hath vs
            (O king) to leaue our port:

            to whom we were comfort.
            In hope to be retaind of you,
            which is our whole request:
            Wherin we trust for to performe,
            that seemes a courtier best.
            The king that wel had markt his tale

            And praysing long within him selfe,
            the yongest brothers chere:
            That sober was presaging truth,
            forthwith doth banish feare.
            And biddes these wery trauelers,
            welcome vnto the place
            Desired long. And intertaines,
            them both with friendly grace.
            Into his court, commaunding them,
            all falshood to expell:
            And geues them pencions yerely,
            wherwith they may liue well.
            
               Thus are these glad Italians,
            new courtiers both become:
            That seeke eche way to purchase loue
            as well of all as some.
            THe king that for disport doth vse,

            The king in case hath lost his mates,
            and in his wandring, hée
            Findes, out a lothsome Lion coucht
            that monstrous was to sée.
            wherto he makes a thundring course
            with speare well set in rest:
            the Lyon rampant méetes the staffe,
            that it to sheuers brest.
            Then glaiue he drawes like noble knight,
            and strikes with courage stout:
            And prickes, and breathes, and strikes again,
            as one deuoide of double,
            
               But all in vayne those strokes are spent
            his traunchfer, nought doth carue,

            least he were put to shame:
            And least his former worthines,
            should ende with vanquisht name.
            Wherfore he mightely defends
            him selfe from Lions clawes,
            That rasethall attayned to
            with those his persing pawes.

            nothing preuaile in strength,
            But ward, & stroke, are bootles spent
            when down he must at length.
            Thus as the Lion had the best,
            and almost won the féelde:

            and stoppe his vitall breath.

            that would whole volumes spend.
            
               For after she had knowen his name,
            and how an aliant borne
            He was, her hart began to coole,
            as one welny forlorne.

            that fansies be of mynde:
            And eke vnconstant groundes of troth,
            as writers haue definde.

            It is, that lothsome loues dispayre
            my griping griefes doth feede.
            Yet Poets say that dreames be true
            and things to come foreshowes,
            For profe, they tel a doleful dreame,
            that Creasides ghost well knows.

            And Ioseph saw in slumbring sleape,
            what honour should befall

            before his shefe did fall.

            Therfore in hope of happie hap,

               And if such lotte belotted me,

            in temple for to looke.
            The Lady doth present her selfe,
            before his mistres eyes:
            With booke in hand Ieneuore,
            in hast to chappell hyes.
            They passe wheras

               She was as mindefull of her graunt
            as he of his request:
            And therwith gaue to him the booke,
            whic
                  •
                she in hand hath prest.
            He folowes our Ieneuora,
            she backward doth retire:
            His letter in the booke is cold,
            as he would best desire.
            The Princes is come to the pew,
            wher wonted she doth pray,
            He humbly yeld to her the booke,
            and so departes away.
            But when she saw Ariodant,
            whom more then life she loud,
            (As one amazd) the blushing bloud,
            from wonted course is moud:
            Which driues away the colour pale,
            which earst was in her face:
            (A signe they say of tried truth,
            and store of giltles grace)
            In doughtful plight the Lady kneels
            if vision she had seene:
            Or if conceit of idle brayne,
            the cause therof had bene.
            The truth it selfe doth hardly lodge,
            within her doutfull head:
            Besides the nouelties therof,
            haue 
                  •
               ouell fansies bread.
            In these conceites, she opes the booke
            the letter is deseride:
            She languisheth till that theffect
            therof she hath espide.
            
               With rauish brayn she hath purusd.
            her louers dolefull plaint:
            And twenty times she doth vnread,
            how loue did him attaint.
            She reades (with ruth) is termes of grac

            His vowed troth, for ay she reades,
            which in her hart is graud.
            What shuld I say, the happie newes
            with auncient woes contend:
            So diuersly, within her corps,
            that backward she doth bend.

            of paper, which doth serue:
            To answere to his letter sent,
            for which he nie doth sterue.
            Therin she blisseth thryse the tyme
            when he did tread on ground:
            Of Scottish Realme, whose like (quoth she)
            in earth can not be found.
            Therin she blisseth eke him selfe,
            that would take such great payne:
            To sée so meane a wight as she,
            in whom doth not remayne.
            Halfe that great prayse, which he bestowes,
            on her vnworthy shape:
            Which is the worst that euer did,
            from natures handes escape.
            Then dolefully she doth lament,
            his long sustained woe:
            His pining fittes, vnquiet rest,
            his cares she rues also.
            Now is the time, when Uenus first
            did thrall her to her lore:
            Declared eke, and care, for care,
            she doth requi

               e, and more.
            Now doth she, (like an Oratres)
            perswade him to be true:
            She vows by Ioue to shun the paths,
            that she wils him eschue.
            What should I say, she tels y• time,
            she tels the secret place:
            When either, other person, may
            without suspect imbrace.
            
               Untill which time, she wished him,
            amendment of his fittes:
            With thousand ioyes, which to declare,
            would trouble sore my wittes.
            Well wery hand and watched eye,
            seeke now longe shunned rest:
            As sleape to work thy drousie charme,
            at hand is ready prest.
            This night, the glad Ieneuora,
            of sleape receiueth more:
            Then in six months and odde (I think)
            she did receiue before.
            Ariodant (as Marchant tost
            with stormes from kenned land:
            That feares by rock, or swallowing goulfe,
            his deaths day is at hand)
            Dispayring lies, and dreadfull thoughtes
            oppresse his crased minde:
            And doughting most that battred barke,
            so soone good port should finde,
            Yet as he had concluded, he
            by breake of day doth ryse:
            And in dispite of fortune, mindes
            tachtefe his interpryse.
            Ieneuora, (though heauy head,
            did craue more golden sleape,)
            Is not vnmindfull of her charge:
            ne lenger bedde doth keape.
            But long before Ariodant,
            she doth vnknown arise:
            And with her letter hastely,
            to priuie garden hies.
            
               And as she had deuised earst,
            within her little scrowle:
            She hides it by the Oliue trée,
            vnknown to any soule.
            That done, to warme an easie bed
            (not waking any wight,)
            She plies againe, and lieth till
            Aurora geueth light.
            Then vp she startes, & decks her self,
            with costlie robes of gould:

               ould.
            Then close in closet she doth put
            the scrowle into the booke:
            Which first she made, of purpose, y•
            
            her friend theron should looke.
            That done, she thus commaundes her mayd

            That last did beare the booke, when I,
            to chappell went to pray.
            And craue the booke agayne of you,

            where lurking he did stay:
            She is scarce gone, when secretly,

            Then secretly the fearfull man,
            doth prie within the booke:
            The scrowle he finds, & takes it out,
            he cannot therin looke.
            For feruent ioye: he puts it vp,

            These frendly looks, which after that
            for euer lodge in hart.

            His clothes he bathes with gushing teares,
            that run from swelling eyes.
            His ioye is in her secretnes,
            that myndes not to disclose:
            His preferd loue, as by thappointted

            And though she now doth light estéeme,
            and will not heare my plaint:
            In tract of time my fittes I trust,

               He thinkes now of the courteous lines,
            whiche she to him did sende:
            He reades them till by hart eche worde
            he knowes, and then doth rende
            The paper, least by some mishappe,
            the letter lost and founde:
            Mought turne to his decaye, and hers,
            to whome he chiefe is bounde.

            whiche she did late inuent:
            Where he with sight of her his ioye,
            his minde he mought content.
            Against which time he deckes himselfe
            with sutes of ioyfull hewe,
            And throwes away his mournyng wéedes,
            he lothes on them to vewe.
            He now doth vaunt him self, amongst

            His gladnes, hath brought hunger to,

            He is not now on tomblyng bed,
            nor wandryng nowe alone:
            He doth not nightly now lament,
            nor filles the skies with mone:
            But like a careles youth the daye,
            in sundrie sportes he spendes,
            And so the nightes in maskes, and showes,
            he bringeth to their endes
            In fine, eche care, that whylom was,
            to him griefe and annoie:
            Is nowe become a treble blisse,
            and twentie fould more ioye.

            As how with sighes the day he spent

               With such like talke, the tyme is spent,
            and now is come the howre:
            When sugrie presence, they must change
            for pensife parting sowre.
            They rue their want, and hate the tyme,
            that byds them to depart:

            vnto the Princes grace,
            A Diamond of passing prise,
            a ringe that did abace:
            All Iuels that before that tyme,
            were seene in Scottish land:
            Whose gleming stone causd gasing eyes

            She takes the ring with ioyful hart,
            she geues to him againe
            A token, which doth signifie,
            she faithfull will remaine.
            With ioyned lips, they say farewell,
            with pressed hand in hand
            They vow: that to that place ech day
            to come no let shall stand.
            Againe they kisse, and faintly then,

            Of chast Dianas nimphes, and he

            Sometime with racket he doth tosse

            He cannot that forget, where he
            his Lady shall imbrace.
            
               There (as it lighted in his head)

            And sith he séekes to haue his fall.
            a myrrour to the rest:
            That line, I will begin with him,
            and let the other rest.
            THere was amongst the Scottish Lordes,
            (whom honour did aduaunce
            To noble style,) a mightie Duke,
            of bloud, although hard chaunce,
            Oh filthie facte, dispoyld him quite
            of former dignitie:
            And forst him leaue his tipe of might,
            to peruerse miserie.
            
               This Prince was Duke of Albany,
            and Pollinesso hight:
            And vassall to the Scottish king,
            a subtill craftie knight.
            Who well increast in aged yéeres,
            (and yet to chuse a feare)
            Gan greatly loue Ieneuora,
            whom he as liue helde deare.
            And sith he was of noblest birth,
            of subiectes in the land:
            He thought thee rather to obtayne,
            that he did take in hand.
            Wherfore he is in mynd oft tymes,
            to moue the King herein:
            Whose grace once got, he soner thiks
            the Princes for to win.
            Againe thinks he, if she should know
            my mynd is for to craue:
            Her fathers graunt, before I doo
            her fauour seeke to haue:
            The stately dame perhaps wold dain
            my sute and profred loue:
            Therfore he minds this way to deale

            with her in stately court:
            To play with her at chesse, or cardes,
            or other chamber sport.
            And when he sées she pleasant is,
            and in her mery vayne:
            To breake to her such amours, as
            within his hart remaine.
            
               So thought, so don, he wears the day
            as earst he did deuise:
            He hath his fill of Ladies lookes,

            to his reioysing place:
            He sees his Ladie showes to him
            a pleasant smiling face.
            But most of all, and that that most
            augmentes his ielousie:
            Is straungers ring, which she doth weare,
            still gleaming in his eye.
            Wherwith, dispayring in his mynde
            of his late hoped gayne:
            He thinks to spend more time therin
            is booteles and in vayne.

            The Straunger cometh to the court
            (saith he) of curtesie.
            And she requireth, like, for like,
            what if she weare his King?
            The stone is rich, and happely,
            she hath therin liking.
            Besides, will she bestowe her loue
            of one a straunger borne:
            Of mean estate? when Princes loues
            she oft hath had in scorne?

            He countes it vilanie to tell,
            that he could well declare:
            And taught he was from infancie,
            a walking tongue to spare.
            Therfore vnto him selfe he kéepes,
            that lodgeth in his mynde:
            And stayes his mouth from breathing out

            but moued much with ire.

            Such iestes as hidden lye in brest,
            which may content my mynd:

            The Duke agrees to her deuise,
            and (with a ioyfull hart:)
            Doth yelde to hir a thousand thanks:

            and reuell routes weare done)
            Repayres vnto her quiet bedde,

            of purpose to obtaine

            on chamber boorde remayne.
            Ieneuora no sooner had
            on pillow coucht her head:
            But King Dalinda fingerd hath,
            of Diamond she is spead:
            And (duty done) the slately couch,
            she leaueth for that night:
            And to Duke Polinesse then,
            she guydes her feete aright.
            Who found in place appointed, she
            presentes before his eyes.

            And as in you my honour staies,
            which carst my self inioyde.
            So let me finde (my Lord) agayne,
            in gage of willing hart:
            Like deeds vnto those vowed words,
            which late from you did part.
            She sayd, and then, the Duke replies
            thus to her iust request.
            Or els (qd. he) thou God graunt that
            no life lodge in my brest.

            and so they ioyned handes:
            Let this conclude till fitter time
            the yoke of wedded bandes.
            Thus he departs, with promise made
            before the breake of day:
            To yeld againe the Dyamond,
            no let at all should staye.
            Now is the Duke returned safe,
            vnto his heauy gest:
            Who long hath lurkt on weary bed,
            bereud of former rest.
            So much this late vnlookt for tale,
            dismayes his quiet hart:
            That now well nye he féeles againe,

            The Duke no sooner leaues his stéed
            but to Ariodant
            He hies: that seemes to be a sleape,
            though ease in head is scant.
            And with a pleasant voyce he sayes,

            but then Duke Polinesse

               The Duke, (that heares with grief the ende
            of this late coyned tale

               ,
            no better did preuaile.
            Yet minds he, sith the straunger was
            to him but as a gest:
            Not ferder to eramine him,
            but for to let it rest.
            Till that at fitter time, he may
            a better way inuent:
            For to annoy Ariodant,
            and eke him selfe content.
            And, therwithall, would God (qd he)
            I wish for thy behoue:
            That as thou saist, so tract of time,
            the truth herein may proue.
            And parting thēce, good night (qd he)
            take now thy quiet rest:
            And to your grace, god graunt (qd he)
            such ease as likes you best.
            Thus is Duke Polinesso come,
            vnto his chamber, where
            Unto a secrete friend of his
            he geues the ring, to beare.
            Unto his friend Dalinda, least,
            the Diamond shuld be wanting:
            And so preuent his purpose, and
            turne to her great vndoing.
            Post hast, therfore this messenger,
            is prekt with Diamond
            To court, who at the last, by happe
            Dalinda hath out found.
            
               To whom, (with thou
                  •
               and thankes) he geues
            the gleaming gem
                  •
                agayne:
            From Polinesso (mighty Duke)
            that doth her friend remayne.
            Thus leaue I him that ended hath
            his message in his best wise:
            And now vnto Ariodant,
            I will my stile deuise.
            When Polinesso vttred had,
            that lurked in his brest:
            And showed had the Diamond,
            vnto his heauy gest.
            When gon he was out of the sight,
            of poore Ariodant:
            Who in his new disquiet mynde
            ould corsies did not want.
            Then, gins the straunger to record,
            the ring which he did sée:
            And fear doth m

            Which he did geue Ieneuora,
            wherfore through euery part:
            Of his distemperd limmes, procéede
            an ake, and deadly smart.
            From head, and hart, doth passe also
            a could, and lothsome sweat:
            And temples both, and pulses two,
            refuse their liuely heate.

               Sometimes, (for lacke of breath) he lies

            And in his rage, lyke frantike man,
            his careful head he smyghtes.
            And when his fittes be of least force,
            then with a

            Unto himselfe in secret wyse,
            these woords he doth impart.
            Oh deepe discent, oh hidden guile,
            oh falshood furie fell,
            Oh cruell spight, condemned be
            thy ghost to lothsome hell:
            That so canst fawn on simple wight
            with pleasant smilyng chere,
            And with a hart inuenemed,
            to kyll that houlds the deare.
            Oh wretch, I skorne the present ioy
            and eke thy Princely state:
            And happy thrise wer these my eyes.
            to see thy latest fate.
            Consumed be thy cherefull health,
            and sicknes scale thy corse:
            Let sadnes, from eche part of thée,
            all pleasure quite deuorse.
            Conuerted he the cristall hewe,
            to foulest colour vyle:
            And all diseases rule in thée,
            when health is in erile.
            for thou (oh careles wretch) hast forst
            my limmes that lyude in ioy)
            To taste the most vnquiet rest,
            that any can anoye.
            
               And as he would haue furder said,
            from stringes of swelled hart:
            A deadly grone proceedes, and eke
            most scorning sobbes depart.
            And therwithall, oh death (quoth he)
            wreake on my corse thy will,
            Asunder sheare my vitall thréed:
            oh Atrapos doo kill.
            The most vnhappiest creature,
            that treades on sinfull soyle:
            And you oh sisters cut the thread,
            and ease me of this toyle.
            Thus whilst he waies y• brightnes of
            this goodly Diamond:

            doth nye his wittes confound.
            But when he doth call vnto mynde,
            what friendly actes haue past,
            Twixt him and his Ieneuora,
            he calles his wittes at last.
            To him, and then, his lauish tounge

            And saies, y• nought but tride disceit,
            should faithfull friendes so moue.
            And then he gan to dought beside,
            if that same weare the ring:
            That earst was his, which Poliness
                  •
               
            
            from court with him did bring.
            For though report, did blase (qd he)
            my gem to be the best:
            yet may an other be as good,
            though secretly it rest.
            
               And dayly proufe, doth teach vs eke,
            where Princes fansie frame:
            There goes away the victory,
            and gayne of greatest name.
            And though it were the ring it self,
            that I did late enioye:
            yet till I know more perfect proufe,
            it shall me not annoy.
            For how can such assured signes
            of lasting amitie:
            Be ioynd with crabbed craftines
            and with such subtiltie.
            Did not her letter show to me,
            a louers true intent?
            Did not the passion of her mynde
            to faithfull lynes consent?
            Did she not vow (with drowned eies)

            Could this proceed frō double mynd
            could heauenly shape inuent:
            Such termes of truth, & after wards
            to such disceit consent?
            Can she, that since her infancie,
            was traind in Princely court,
            (Wher wisdoms lore,

            Beare in her hart such fayned truth,
            and vse such subtill witte?
            Or els vpon well meaning wight,
            such spightfull hatred spitte?
            
               Can craftines finde harborow,
            within so goodly shape?
            when nature serude so worthy corpse
            could truth from her escape?
            Can double dealing lodge within
            so worthy creature?
            Who for her passing comelynes
            gaines lasting lyfe tindure?
            No, no, I doo abandon now
            my former fonde conceit,
            And eke the sparkes of black dispaire
            I will extinguishe strayt:
            For tyll those eyes doo plainely sée,
            or els those eares doo heare,
            Disdainful lookes, or scornful woords
            such fittes shall not me deare.
            Tyll then, (though some presuming
            there be of fained loue)

            The Princes court, wher no man is
            more welcomer then he:
            As well vnto Ieneuora
            as to the Ladies frée.
            And ther, (like to his wonted guile)
            he dayly doth discourse:
            Of histories: or riddels els
            he learnes to tel by course.
            Thus leaue I him that showes a face
            of perfect blisse and ioye:
            Though now & then amidst disportes
            dispayre doth him annoy.
            And to the Duke I must agayne
            my solom verse returne:
            That seeks (vnhappy man) eche way,
            to cause the straunger mourne.
            THough Polinesso wel had wayde,
            vnto what small effect:
            His former fond, and lewd denise,
            by yll luck was direct.
            Though he perceiud how contrary
            eche point therof did proue:
            And that no sight of gem, ne talke,
            could ough
                  •
                the straunger moue.
            
               Yet could he not slack lenger time,
            (inforst by ielousie)
            But néeds he must deuise of newe,
            some other policie.
            Wherfore, when that Ariodant
            was gone vnto the court:
            He leaues his home, and thether to,
            in hast be doth, resort:
            Wher like vnto his former wont,
            he feedes his doting eye
            With Princes lookes, & takes therat
            a great felicitie.
            And she agayn, (that knew right wel
            the skill of curtesie.)
            Doth friendly intertaine the Duke
            into her company.
            But furdest from her honest hart,
            (I dare avowe) was loue:
            To him whose grauer yéeres, should shunne
            such youthfull toyes to moue.

            to moue thee to beleue:

            There all the morning she doth spend
            as temples hestes require,
            And prayers sayde, to court againe
            the Princes doth retire.

            Wherfore as one not well assurd
            of Scottish faithfulnes:
            Ne certain that the Duke did meane
            as late he did expresse.
            Least that (I say) in some dark place
            he had imbusht a crewe:
            Of traytors to inuyron him,
            when he this sight should vewe.
            He comes vnto his brother then,

            with minde complet with dread.
            
               Ariodant, (though noble hart,
            did scorne for to remayne
            In such distres, and rather chusd
            by death to ease his payne,)
            Yet feeling pangs of lothsome death,
            which kinde could not indure:
            He striues againe to get that life,
            which care did earst procure
            To banish from his vexed limmes,
            and vsing lothed might:
            by force of armes & stretched legges

            that foule and dreadfull thought:
            Which carefull wretch Ariodant
            to deare well me had bought.
            Thus quite from death, the straunger now
            doth sommon wits againe,
            To counsell what is best to doo
            amidst these stormes of raine.

            to shunne false Uenus bayte:
            Perswade thy selfe, the blynded boy
            no more for thée will wayte.
            With that conceit affection,
            doth seeme for to agree,
            Although in reasons they be all,
            and therfore thus saith hée.
            
               How knowest thou Lurcanio

            to ryd his lothed life?
            The best is thinke by pining dayes,

            And I (qd vertue) can not yeld,
            vnto your ioynt consents:
            I sée small reason to induse
            me, to so straunge intents.

            The court was causer of thy care,
            by court did spryng thy paine:
            Then let these daungers of the court
            from court straunge the againe.
            The wyly byrd can shunne the net
            which earst enthrald her so:
            The sely mouse once caught in trap,
            can shunne the guyle also.

            So hard it is to maister loue
            which rooted is in hart:
            But rather by continual sight
            is growen a greater smart.
            
               And as vnto Lurcanio,
            how he these newes will take:
            I dought it not but for thy death
            he great complaint wil make.
            But for to say, in desperat wise,
            he will him selfe confound,
            Thats very straunge,

               ted with
            a deede of such outrage.
            Wherfore sith doughtfull yet it lies,
            within our princely minde
            And sith none but Lurcanio.
            this foule abuse doth finde
            
               We will before our sentence geuen
            examine this accusd:
            That hath by whordom (as thou saist)
            our state so much abusd.
            And least thou deeme mée partiall,
            I do accept thy gage
            Condicionly, that thou thy self,
            this proferd fight shalt wage
            Against who listeth to mainteine
            her truth against thy might
            (Like to our auncient laws ordeind)
            by force of combat fight.
            And it thou gaine the victory.
            then she to flames of fire:
            If vanquist thou, she frée shall liue,
            thou death shalt haue for hire.
            Which fight we wil shalbe performd
            vpon the fiftéenth day:
            Ensuing next, when God (I trust)
            the right with right will pay.
            So sayd, Lurcanio leaues the King,
            and to his chamber hies:
            Wher for his brothers death he doth
            renewe his wonted cries.
            But careful king, (whē straūger was
            departed from his sight:)
            (In minde to trie his truth herein)

            To whome, she is no sooner come,
            but voydance then is made
            Of eche estate, and then the king
            with trickling teares thus sayde.

            Tis so (qd he) Ieneuora
            whylst in our Princely court
            We weard away our crooked age,

            Before our presence doth appeare,

            that hath deserued fyre,

            for such offence most fitte.
            which iudgement I haue stayed yet,
            to heare what thou canst saye:
            why dreadful doome of present death,

            no gift at all did want.

            of him the summe and all.
            Of that he sought within the listes,

            and with a cherefull voyce:
            She prayes to God, with whom she hopes
            shortly for to reioyce.

            yet as he can he lendes a blowe,
            and then he shiftes againe:
            From dint of brothers stroke, whose forse
            would well requite his payne.
            Thus he doth strike, and he the blow

            and way her penitence.

            doth choke welny her breath.

            which she did neuer know:
            (To length y• time) she praies to God

            whilst thus she prays aduēture droue
            through search of nearest way:
            To Scottish court, vpon the place
            wher she deuout doth pray.
            The famous knight Raynaldo, who
            beholding with his eye:
            betwixt two Ruffians naked swords
            a Lady prest to die.
            He spurs his Stéed, & draws his blade
            and driues vnto them twoo:
            In mynde to reseue if he could
            that carefull wight from woo.
            The tormenters that saw him come
            dispayring of their might:
            Forsake y• mayd & mount on Steeds
            and saue them selues by fight.
            which when Dalinda vews, she thus
            vnto Raynald gan say:
            Yet let me craue this curtes
                  •
               e
            or thou depart away.
            
               (Oh worthy Knight,) that is, y• thou
            wilt be my guyde vnto
            The most vnhapiest Scottish court
            and most complete with woe.
            Wher I shal bring the ioyfulst news
            that euer came to kyng:
            And tell the gladdest tale that earst,
            a messenger did bring.
            Raynaldo grauntes to her desire
            she is now horst againe:
            They forward poste, and as they ride
            she greatly doth complaine.
            Of false Duke Polinessos guyle
            she blames his subtill wilte:
            And for reuenge to god she cries
            for such offence most fitte.
            Thus weary time is spent, and now
            they are within the vewe:
            of flaming bronds of glistring swords
            and of the Scottish crewe.

            that ringes so in their eares:
            And therwithall Raynaldo and
            Dalinda, do appeare.
            who passing throgh y• mightie prease,
            at last approche the seate:
            Of Scottish King, wheras Dalind
            beginnes for to intreate.
            
               Of all the treason which the Duke
            and she did late deuise,
            But crying first, staye Polinesse,
            thus to her tale she plies.
            Why shuld I lenger stay (oh wretch)
            why should my lippes refrayn
            From sounding out the perfect troth
            which hidden, séekes to stayne
            The giltles Imphe of vertues schoole
            whose spotlesse troth doth crie
            For iust reuenge for such offence,
            to him that rules skie.
            Oh king let dought of daughters crime,
            no more dismaye thy mynde.
            Ne let thy hart to feareful thoughts,
            for princes be inclinde:
            For this thryse cursed tongue of myne,
            shall plainly show to thee:
            Who did offende, who gaind this fire,
            from which the prince is frée.
            And though mine own reproch, I must
            blase here amidst this presse,
            Yet gnawing thoughts of gilty minde,
            inforce me troth confesse.
            This Duke (oh king) this Polinesse
            this false disceitful Knight
            And I vnhappiest wretch it was,
            that gaynd these flames of right.
            For sée disceit: whilst in the court,
            I led a rechles race,
            And whylst amongst the courtly trayne,
            I servde the princes grace.
            
               There came to me this Polinesse,
            who with a smyling chere,
            And glosing woords gan long discours
                  •
               
            
            what friendship he did beare
            To me, and how his whole desire
            was to obteyne my loue
            Which for to get with tedious sute,
            he séekes me long to proue.
            But see, as forced watch doth make,
            the sauage Hauke to fist:
            As strained bitte the Coult vntamd,
            doth make apt to the lift:
            So did this Dukes continuall sute
            enforce me to consent:
            In hope of lawfull mariage,
            vnto his false intent.
            The conquest gaind, he showes him pleas'd,
            and I, in hope of blisse,
            Doo finde my selfe not discontent,

            Upon a day Duke Polinesse
            thus to me gan report.
            If that I thought my former woords

            I would refraine that now I mynde
            in presence here declare,
            And closly in my secrete mynde,
            such passions I would spare.
            
               But déede shal showe the summe (qd he,)
            of my well meaning hart,
            And eke in woordes my iust intent,
            to thee I shall impart.
            Thou knowst (qd he) what goulden tyme
            in seruice I haue spent:
            In hope to gayne at last for hyre
            the princesse like assent.
            Thou partli knowst, my faithful hart
            and loyall loue to hir:

                  •
                vs'd
            hir friendship for to styre.
            But only I to wel haue known
            how euel she did requite
            My vowed troth, and how my loue,
            she had in great despite.
            Which when with griefe I vewd (qd he)
            I sought by reasons skill
            To maister loue, and by aduise
            to tame affections will.
            And thinking that the second nayle,
            could soone expell the first,
            I hardly finde this moysture can
            asswage my former thrust.
            Thus tost am I with bylowes great
            of great vnrest (qd he)
            And onely finde by sage aduise,

            I thinke (qd he) the heauens it will,
            that that selfe same attyre
            Which she did weare, when first I did
            so much her loue desire.
            
               Should quite my former thraled hart,
            of euell requsted loue:
            And from thy breast it doughts remayn

            Wherfore I will, that with those robes,
            that prince in feast doth wear
                  •
               
            
            Hard by the outwast houses thou
            Dalinda shalt appeare
            To me where I in scorne of prince
            will tosse her princely trayne:
            And ther refigne the latest fittes,
            of my long proued payne.
            With smal request I graunted haue
            to his so sugred tale:
            And to thappointed place also,
            to come I did not fayle.
            Wher I in robes of princes grace,
            when sleape the prince possest:
            With Iu
                  •
               ls, tablets, cheins, & ringes,
            did yelde to his request.
            This same was it, and that was I
            whome straunger so didisée:
            The night when feast in court was held
                  •
               
            
            wherof princesse is free.
            But heare oh king the ende of all,
            iudge of this traitrous part,
            Sée how the filed woords agreed,
            with false disceitfull hart.
            When giltles thus Lurcanio had
            accus'd the princesse grace
            And when for trial of her truth
            the tyme and setted place.

            mought any wayes appeare:
            And doughting still my secret mynde

            He mindes to put in practise now,
            his long pretensed hate.
            And sending me with Ruffians two,
            vnto a desert woode:
            (In steede of present mariage,)
            he seekes to shead my bloud.
