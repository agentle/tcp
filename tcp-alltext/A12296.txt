GHOST.
            TO all Tapſters and Tiplers,
            And all Ale-houſe Vitlers,
            Inne-keepers, and Cookes,
            That for pot-ſale lookes,
            And will not giue meaſure,
            But at your owne pleaſure,
            Contrary to Law,
            Scant meaſure will draw,
            In Pot, and in Canne,
            To cozen a Man
            Of his full Quart a penny,
            Of you there's to many:
            For in King Harry's time,
            When I made this Rime
            Of Elynor Rumming,
            
            With her good Ale tunning;
            Our Pots were full quarted,
            We were not thus thwarted,
            With froth-Canne and nick-pot,
            And ſuch nimble quick-ſhot,
            
               
That a dowzen will ſcore,
            For twelue pints, and no more.
            Full Wincheſter gage,
            We had in that age,
            The Dutchmans ſtrong Beere,
            Was not hopt ouer heere;
            To vs 'twas vnknowne.
            Bare Ale of our owne,
            In a Bowle we might bring,
            To welcome the King,
            And his grace to beſeech,
            With Waſſall my Leigh.
            
            Nor did that time know
            To puffe and to blow
            In a peece of white clay,
            As you doe at this day,
            With fier and coale,
            And a leafe in a hole,
            As my Ghoſt hath late ſeene,
            As I walked betweene
            Weſtminſter Hall
            And the Church of Saint Paul,
            
            And ſo thorow the Citie,
            Where I ſaw and did pitty,
            My Countrymens caſes,
            With fiery-ſmoke faces,
            
               
Sucking and drinking
            A fylthie Weede ſtinking
            Was ne're knowne before
            Till the Deuill, and the More,
            In th'Indies did meete,
            And each other there greete,
            With a health they deſire
            Of ſtinke, ſmoake and fier:
            But who e're doth abhorre it,
            The Citie ſmoakes for it;
            Now full of fier ſhops,
            And fowle ſpitting chops,
            So neeſing and coughing,
            That my Ghoſt fell to ſcoffing,
            And to my ſelfe ſaid,
            Here's filthy fumes made:
            Good Phyſicke of force
            To cure a ſicke horſe.
            Nor had we ſuch ſlops,
            And ſhagge-haire on our tops:
            At wearing long haire,
            King Harry would ſweare,
            And gaue a command
            With ſpeede out of hand,
            All heads ſhould be powl'd,
            Aſwell young as old,
            
               
And his owne was firſt ſo,
            Good enſample to ſhow.
            Y'are ſo out of faſhion,
            I know not our Nation,
            Your Ruffes and your Bands,
            And your Cuffes at your hands,
            Your Pipes and your ſmokes,
            And your ſhort curtall Clokes,
            Scarfes, Feathers, and Swerds,
            And thin bodkin Beards;
            Your Waſtes a ſpan long,
            Your knees with points hung,
            Like Morris-daunce Bels,
            And many toyes els,
            Which much I diſtaſte,
            But Skelton's in haſte
            My Maſters, Farewell,
            Reade ouer my Nell,
            
            And tell what you thinke
            Of her and her drinke;
            If ſhee had brew'd amiſſe,
            I had neuer wrote this.

TVNNING OF
ELYNOVR OF RVMMING.
            
               TEll you I chill, if that you will,
            A While be ſtill, of a merry Gyll,
            That dwelt on a Hill, but ſhe is not grill:
            For ſhe is ſomwhat ſage, & well worne in age,
            For her viſage it would aſſwage
            A mans courage.
            Her lothly leere, is nothing cleere,
            But vgly of cheere, droupy and drowſie,
            Scuruy and lowſie, her face all bowſie;
            Comely cryncled, wondrouſly wrinckled,
            Like a roaſt Pigges eare, briſtled with haire,
            Her lewd lips twaine, they ſlauer men ſayne
            Like a ropie rayne.
            A gummy glaire, ſhe is vgly faire,
            Her Noſe ſomedeale hooked, and camouſly crooked,
            Neuer ſtopping, but euer dropping,
            Her Skin looſe and ſlacke, grain'd like a ſacke,
            With a crooked backe.
            Her Eyne gowndy, are full vnſoundy,
            For they are bleared, and ſhe gray-haired,
            Iawed like a Ietty, a man would haue pitty,
            To ſee how ſhee's gumd, fingerd and thumbd,
            
               
Gently ioynted, greas'd and annointed▪

            Witherd like hay, the wooll worne away,
            And yet I dare ſay, ſhe thinkes her ſelfe gay,
            Vpon the holyday, when ſhe doth her aray,

            With a paire of heeles, at broad as two wheeles;
            Shee hobbles like a Gooſe, with her blauked hoſe,

               And this comely dame, I vnderſtand her name
               Is Elynour Rumming at home in her wonning,
               And as men ſay, ſhe dwelt in Sothray,

Shee is a Tonniſh gib, the deuill and ſhe be ſib,
               But to make vp my tale, ſhee brueth nappy ale,
               And makes thereof pot-ſale.
               To Trauellers and Tinkers, to ſweaters and ſwinkers
               And all good-Ale drinkers, that will nothing ſpare,
               But drinke till they ſtare, and bring themſelues bare,
               With now away the Mare, and let vs ſley care,
               As wiſe as an hare.
               Come who ſo will, to Elinour on the hill,
               With fill the cup fill and ſit thereby ſtill
               Early and late, thither comes Kate,
               
               
                  Ciſly and Sare, with their legs bare,
               And alſo their feete, hardly vnſweet.
               With their heeles dagged, their kirtles all to iagged,
               Their ſmockes all to ragged.
               With titters and tarters, bring diſhes and platters,
               Withall their might running, to Elinour Rumming,
               
               To haue of her Tunning.
               Shee giues them of the ſame, and thus begins the game,
               Some wenches vnbraced, and ſome all vnlaced,
               With their naked paps, their flips and flaps,
               It wigs and it wags, like tawny ſaff'ron bags;
               A ſort of foule drabs, all ſcuruie with ſcabss,
               Some be flye-bitten, ſome skew'd like a kytten.
               Some with a ſhoe-clout, binde their heads about;
               Some haue no haire-lace, their lockes about their face,
               Their treſſes vntruſt, all full of vnluſt,
               Some looke ſtrawry, ſome cawry mawry;
               Some vntydie tegges, like rotten egges,
               Such a lewd ſort to Elinour reſort,
               From tide to tide, abide, abide,
               And to you ſhall betold, how her Ale is ſold
               To Mawte and to Mold.
            
            
               
               Secundus Paſſus.
               Some haue no money, that thither commy
               For their Ale to pay, that is a ſhrewd aray:
               
                  Elinour ſweares nay, ye beare not away
               My Ale for nought, by him that me bought,
               With hey dogge hey, haue theſe dogges away,
               With get me a ſtaffe, the ſwine eat all my draffe,
               Strike the Hogs with a club, they haue drunke vp my tub;
               For be there neuer ſo much preſe, the ſwine go to the hy deſe,
               The ſow with her pigges, the bore his taile wrigges,
               Againſt the high bench, with fough heres a ſtench,
               Gather vp then wench, ſeeſt thou not what's fall,
               Take vp dirt and all, and beare out of the hall,
               God giue it ill preeuing, clenly as euill chieuing,
               But let vs turne plaine, where we left againe,
               For as ill a patch as that, the hens run in the maſh-fat;
               For they goe to rouſt, ſtraight ouer the ale iuſt,
               And dong when it comes, in the ale tonnes:
               Then Eliinour taketh the maſh-boule, and ſhaketh
               The hens dong away, and ſcomes it in a tray
               Where the yeaſt is, with her mangie fiſtis,
               And ſometime ſhe blens the dong of her hens
               And the ale together, and ſaies Goſſip come hither,
               This ale ſhall be thicker, and flower the more quicker,
               For I may tell you, I learn'd it of a Iew,
               
               When I began to brew, and I haue found it trew,
               Drinke now while it is new,
               And ye may it brooke, it ſhall make you looke
               Yonger then you be, yeares two or three,
               For ye may proue it by me, behold I ſay and ſee
               
                  
How bright I am of blee,
               Ich am not caſt away, that can my husband ſay,
               When we kiſſe and play in luſt and in liking,
               He cals me his whiting, his mulling and his mittine,
               His nobes and his conny, his ſweeting and honny,
               With Baſſe my pretty bonny, thou art worth good & mony,
               This make I my falyre fanny, till he dreame and dronny,
               For after all our ſport, then will he rout and ſnort,
               Then ſweetly together we lye, as two pigges in a ſtye,
               To ceaſe me ſeemeth beſt of this tale to reſt,
               And leaue this letter, becauſe it is no better,
               Becauſe 'tis no ſweeter, we will no farther rime
               Of it at this time, but we will turne plaine,
               Where we left againe.
            
            
               Tertius Paſſus.
               In ſteede of quoine and mony, ſome bring her a conny,
               And ſome a pot with honny, ſome a ſalt, ſome a ſpone,
               Some their hoſe, ſome their ſhoone, ſome ran a good trot,
               With skillet or pot, ſome fill a bagge full
               Of good Lemſter wooll, an huſwife of truſt,
               When ſhe is a thirſt, ſuch a web can ſpin,
               Her thrift is full thin.
               Some goe ſtraight thither, be it ſlaty or ſlidder,
               They hold the high-way, they care not what men ſay,
               Be they as be may. Some loth to be eſpide,
               Start in at the backſide, Ouer hedge and pale,
               And all for good ale, ſome ran till they ſweat,
               And bring Malt or Wheat, and Ellinour entteate,
               To byrle them of the beſt; then comes another gueſt,
               Shee ſwear'd by the roode of reſt, her lips are ſo dry,
               
                  
Withont drinke ſhe muſt die, therefore fill by and by,
               And haue her pecke of Rye.
               Anon comes another, as dry as the to ther,
               And with her doth bring meale, ſalt, or other thing,
               Girdle or wedding ring, to pay for her ſcot,
               As comes to her lot: Some brings their husbands hood,
               Becauſe the Ale is good; another brought his cap
               To offer at the Ale-tap, with flaxe and with toe,
               And ſome brought ſower dowe, with hey and with hoe,
               Sit we downe arow, and drinke till we blow,
               And pipe tirly, tirly lowe.
               Some lai'd to pledge, their hatchet and their wedge,
               Their hickell and their reele, their rocke & ſpinning wheele,
               And ſom went ſo narrow, they laid to pledge their wharrow,
               Their ribskin and ſpindle, their needle and thimble;
               Heere was ſcant thirft, when they made ſuch ſhift,
               Their thirſt was ſo great, they neuer asked for meat,
               But drinke ſtill drinke, and let the cat winke,
               Let vs waſh our gummes from the dry crummes.
            
            
               Quartus Paſſus
               Some for very neede lay downe a skaine of threed,
               Some beanes and peaſe, ſome chaffer dothe aſe;
               Sometime now and than, another there ran
               With a good braſſe pan, her cullourfull wan;
               Shee ran in all haſte, vnbrac'd and

               The Deuill in a brake.
               Then came balting Ioue, and brought a

               Of Bacon that was 
                     〈◊〉
                  , but Lord how 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
               
                  
Angry and waſpie, ſhe began to yawne and gaſpie,
               And bad Elinour goe bet, and fill in good met,
               It was deere that was farre fet.
               Another brought a ſpicke, of a Bacon ſticke,
               Her tongue was very quicke, but ſhe ſpake ſomewhat thicke.
               Her fellow did ſammer and ſtut, but ſhe was a foule ſlut;
               For her mouth foamed, and her belly groaned.
               
                  Ioue ſaine ſhe had eaten a fyeſt, quene (quoth ſt;he) thou lyeſt,
               I haue as ſweete a breath, as thou with ſhamefull death,
               Then Elinour ſaid, ye Callets, I ſhall breake your pallets,
               Without you now ceaſe, and ſo was made a drunken peace.
               Then came drunken Ales, and ſhe was full of tales
               Of tidings in Walles, and St. Iames in Gales,
               And of the Portingales, with loe Goſſip I wis,
               Thus and thus it is, there hath beene great warre
               Betweene Temple Barre and the Croſſe in Cheape,
               And there came a heape of Mill-ſtones in a rout,
               Shee ſpeaketh thus in her ſnout, ſniueling in her noſe,
               As though ſhe had the poſe, loe here is an old tippet,
               You ſhall giue me a ſippet of your ſtrong Ale,
               And God ſend good ſale, and as ſhe was drinking,
               Shee fell in a winking with a barly hood,
               Shee piſt where ſhe ſtood, then began ſhe to weepe,
               And forthwith fell a ſleepe: Elinour tooke her vp,
               And bleſt her with a Cup of new Ale in cornes,
               
                  Ales found therein no thornes, but ſupt it vp at once,
               Shee found therein no bones.

               Now in commeth another rable, firſt one with a ladle
               Another with a cradle, and with a ſide ſadle
               And 
                     〈◊〉
                   began a fable, 
                     〈◊◊〉
                   and a bable,

Vp ſhe ſtart halfe lame, and ſcantly could goe,
               For paine and for woe.
               In came another dant, with a Gooſe and a Gant,
               Shee had a

                   weſant, ſhe was nothing pleaſant,
               Necked like an Elephant, it was a Bullifant,

               Another brought Garlike-heads, another brought her bends
               Of let or of Cole, to offer to the Ale pole.
               Some brought a wimble, and ſome brought a thymble:
               Some brought a ſilke lace, and ſome a pin-caſe:
               Some her husbands Gowne, ſome a Pillow of downe;
               And all this ſhift they make for the good Ale ſake.
               Then ſtart forth a Phiſgigge, and ſhe brought a Bore-pigge,
               The fleſh thereof was ranke, and her breath ſtrongly ſtanlke,
               Yet ere ſhe went ſhe dranke, and gate her great thanke
               Of Elinour for her ware, that ſhe thither bare,
               To pay for her ſhare. Now truly to my thinking,
               This was a ſolemne drinking.
