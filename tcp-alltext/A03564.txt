            MAſter tel me
what thynge
is god. My chylde
he is a thyng ſpyrytuall
in ye whiche
is all dygnyte / and
all perfeccyon / the
whiche is knowynge
all thynges / all
myghtye / and euermore
durynge without
ende / and without
begynnynge of
another. and alſo he
ne may be meſured
ne comprehendid of
man Inough for to
ſe hym ne his beautes / 
ne may be noumbred / nor his dygne puyſſaūce / 
nor maye be taken of any maner entendement ſo moche
is he puyſſaunt and grete. And alſo he is full of all
bounte mercye and grace. ¶ Mayſter may he be no
moo but one onely god. My chylde / nay / For yf there
were many goddes euery of them ſholde be all puyſſaunt
& than myght they make thynges contrary cō
               uenable
yt one to ye other the whiche is ayenſt nature
dyuyne ſo yt he ne may be but one ſubſtantyue / & one
eſſence dyuyne the whiche is pryncypall cauſe effycyent

of all thynges and he is ye ſoueraygne god vnto
the whiche euery herte deſyreth to come the which
entendement humayne ne maye comprehende ne Imagen.
¶ Mayſter wherfore is god called father.
My chylde for the engendrement apperteyneth pryncypally
vnto the father more than vnto the mother / 
wherefore man ſholde graunte vnto god the mooſt
pryncypall partye. ¶ Mayſter wherfore call we not
the ſeconde parſone of the trynyte as well doughter
as ſone. My chylde for as moche as the ſone is of more
ſtronge nature / for he toke nature humayne in the
fourme of man and not of woman. ¶ Mayſter wherfore
is not the holye gooſt called of the ſone and the ſone
were called mother. My chylde it is for that / that
he procedeth and dyſcendeth alſo pryncypally of the
one as of the other. ¶ Mayſter where was god before
that he made the worlde. My chylde he was not
in noo place corporell. For nothynge was but he all
onely / but he was in hym ſelfe father and ſone / & holy
gooſt in one ſelfe eſſence. ¶ Mayſter where is he
now. My chylde god occupyeth no place. But his puyſſaunce
infynyte is ouerall / for he gouerneth ye thynges
the whiche ben in the oryent / and thoſe ye whiche
ben in the occydent / and generallye all the worlde / 
and therefore a man ſayth that he is all tyme and all
thynges. ¶ Mayſter knoweth god all thynges. my
chylde / ye: for in lykewyſe as he is all puyſſaunt alſo
he is all knowynge and all ſeynge. ¶ Mayſter in
what maner made god the aungelles. my chylde he
them made fayre & ſhynynge and without body and
full of meruayelous bounte and ſaiges for to be his
ſpecyall mynyſtres. ¶ Mayſter how ſynned the aungels

that god had made to his ſemblaunce. My chylde
they yelded not graces vnto god of the grete grace
and ſouerayne beaute that he had gyuē them / but enpryded
thē ī myſknowynge of theyr creature. ¶ Maſter
what came of them. My chylde the mooſt greate
mayſters of them fell in to hell & ye other about vs / &
the other in the ayre. ¶ Mayſter wherfore dyſcended
they not all togethers in to hell. My chylde for that / 
that the one ſynned more greuouſly than the other ſo
abyde they all aboute vs / and in the ayre for to proue
the holy perſones. ¶ Mayſter wherfore ne redemed
them Iheſu cryſte as theſe men. My chylde for that
that aungelles ben of more ſtronge mater & without
body & lynned of theyr owne malyce and wyll wtout
ony tēptacyon of other / & alſo for ye nature angelyke
ſholde conuerte theym one tyme alonely vnto good or
vnto euyll / ſo that whan it is conuerted in to the one
it may be conuertyd into the other by the which they
neuer had done well. ¶ Mayſter wherfore ne made
he them that they myght not ſynne. My chylde to ye
ende that by their meryte they ſholde haue grace and
glory in paradyſe. ¶ Mayſter whan god wyſte that
they ſholde ſynne wherfore made he them. My chyld
for to deſteny the good frome the euyll / and to thende
that the good be the moore confermed in bounte / as
the paynter ye whiche ſoweth the blacke and of other
euyll coloures amōge them that be fayre for to make
them ſhewe the more fayre / and in this ſuffreth god
the euyll amonge the good / & alſo god maketh the deuylles
& hell for to execute and to punyſſhe the curſed
and myſerable ſynners of this worlde and he made
paradyſe and the aungelles for to gloryfye the good.

¶ Mayſter knoweth the deuylles all thynges. My
chylde of as moche as theyr nature is more ſpyrytuall
than the nature of man / of as moche ben they the
more ſubtyles and more ſages / and knowen all thynges
paſte & p̄ſent / but of thynges to come they know
nothynge without it be by ſome cōiectures as in defaulte
of the moone / and of ſuche ſemblables / but of
thoughtes of the man they know nothynge / but god
all onely. ¶ Mayſter may they do what they wyll / 
My chylde they wyll not do no good / but they maye
do moche yll / & not ſo moche as they wolde / but that
that god theym ſuffreth lycenceth to do. ¶ Mayſter
the good aūgelles may they ſynne. My chylde whan
the yll aūgelles fell from paradyſe by theyr ſynne the
good were in ſuche wyſe confermed in good / that ſethen
they haue wylled to doo none euyll. ¶ Mayſter
knowe they all thynges / & mayen they all. My chylde
they knowe as I tolde the ryght nowe of the curſyd
aungelles & do that / that they wyll / at the wyll &
commaūdemēt of god / 
for ayēſt ye wyll of god

MAyſter wherfore
dydde god make
men and women. My
chylde for to knowe hȳ
and to loue hym / & for
to fulfyll paradys and
for to put theym in the
places of theym in the
places of the curſed aū
               gelles
in paradyſe / the
whiche they haue loſt

by theyr pryde & myſknowlege. ¶ Mayſter wherof
made god the man & the womā. My chylde he made
them of the ſlyme of the erthe / and knowe thou that
the body humayne is of the foure elementes ye which
ben the erthe / the water / the ayre / and the fyre / ſo yt
the fleſſhe anſwereth vnto erthe / the blode vnto the
water / the wynde the ayre / and ye heete naturall vnto
the fyre. And knowe thou alſo my chylde that the
man is made vnto the ſemblaunce of the worlde / for
as the ſkye hath two gretelyghtes the whiche ben ye
ſonne and the moone. Alſo the man hath two lyght is
in his heed / the whiche ben the two eyen. And as the
ſkaye hath .vij. planettes / In lykewyſe hath ye man
vij. partycyons in his heed. And as the ſee receyueth
in it all thynges / In lykewyſe the wombe of ye man
receyueth in hit all thynges neceſſary vnto the lyfe of
man. And the hardeneſſe of the ſtones anſwereth vnto
the bones and vnto the nayles. And vnto the trees
anſwereth the membres of his bodye. And vnto the
graſſe the heres. Knowe thou my chylde that the bodye
of the man is none other thynge but a tree ouerthrowen
hauynge ye rotes vpwarde / ſo that ye heeres
ben the rotes / & the body is the ſtocke / and the armes
& the legges ben the braūches. The whiche thynge
ſygnyfyeth that we ſholde be enroted vpwarde in to
heuen in ye loue of our creature. ¶ Mayſter wherfore
was the woman made of the ſyde of Adam more ſoner
than of ony other partye. My chylde yf the woman
had be made of the hygheſt party of the mā ſhe
had ben to proude & ſholde haue myſtaken the man / 
And yf ſhe had ben made of the mooſt loweſt partye
of the man / the man ſholde haue to moche dyſprayſed

her. wherfore ſhe was fourmed of the myddle to
thende that ye man her helde for his cōpany. ¶ Mayſter
wherof made god the ſoule of the man & of ye woman.
My chylde he it create vnto his ſemblaunce / for
the ſoule is alſo a ſubſtaunce ſpyrytuall hauynge entendement / 
wyll / and remembraunce. ¶ Mayſter
made god the man and the woman with his owne
hādes. My chylde he thē made all onely at his worde
and commaundement. ¶ Mayſter wherfore made
god the man of ſo vyle mater. My chylde to the ende
y• he were the more humble and to thende that the deuyll
be the more confuſyd ſeynge the man made of ſo
vyſe mater to be in paradyſe from whens he is fallē
by his pryde. ¶ Mayſter wherfore made god the beſtes.
My chylde god hathe made the good beeſtes to
thende that man be helped at his nede / and hath made
the curſed and myſcheuous for to abate the pryde
of the man / for whan they noyen hym / he maye well
thynke that he is a lytell thynge as of hymſelfe whā
he may not reſyſt them. Alſo there be made many beſtes
for to gyue vs exaumple to lyue as theſe antes / 
or pyſmares / and ſpyders the whiche contynuallye

the man vnto his prouffyte and vtylyte / and yet he

the whiche ye leeſt glorye ſurmounteth all the Ioyes

wele to blame the whyche myſknoweth his creature
ye whiche ſomoche of grace to hym hath done ſeynge
that the beeſtes the whiche ne haue wytte / ne vnderſtandynge / 
hym loue and thanke in demaundynge

was Adam create. My chylde he was create in ebrō
& after was put in to paradyſe terreſter. ¶ Mayſter
what thȳge is in paradyſe terreſter / and where is it
My chylde it is a place delectable in the oryont ouer
ye mountaynes of egypt wherin ben trees of dyuerſe
vertues / and of ſuche there are that who ſo eteth of
them he ſhall neuer haue hunger / and of other by nature
ſhall neuer dye. ¶ Mayſter where was the woman
created. My chylde ſhe was created in paradyſe
terreſtre / but the man was create wtout for be put
wtin in poſſeſſyon. ¶ Mayſter wherfore ſynned the
man and the woman. My chylde by the decepcyon of
the deuyl and by theyr folyſſhe thynkynge treſpaſſed

his place in paradyſe ye whiche he had loſt by his pryde.
¶ Mayſter in what fourme tempted the ennemy
theym. My chylde / the deuyll appered vnto them in
the fourme of ſerpent tellynge them that yf they ete
of that fruyte they ſholde knowe as moche as god.
¶ Mayſter wherfore ne created god the men confermed
in grace as the aungelles. My chylde god wolde
that the men were ſemblable vnto hym as all thynges
to take of hym / god wolde that all were borne of
Adam. ¶ Mayſter why had he not made them that
they myght not haue ſynned. My chylde to the ende
that they had the more of meryte. ¶ Mayſter howe
had they engendred in paradyſe terreſtre. My chyld
as thou ſholdeſt put thyne one hande wtin thyn other

My chylde it is in the tenth heuen the whiche is aboue

for as moche as it is more clere and more ſubtyll

how longe abode Adam & Eue in paradys terreſtre.
My chylde frome the mornynge tyll vnto ye houre of
noone / for at the .iij. houre Adam put the names in ye
thynges / & about mydday they ſyn̄ed / & at none they
were banyſſhed / & at ſuche houre dyed Iheſu cryſte.
¶ Maiſter in to what place yede Adam whā he was

               . ¶ Mayſter ſyth yt the deuyl tēpted Adā & Eue
why were they ſo greuoſly puniſſhed. My chylde for
that / yt they myſtoke the cōmaundement of god for to
obey to the ꝑſuacyons of ye deuyll / & that they ne helde
theym contente wt god that ſomoche of grace vnto
them had gyuen. By the whiche they ſynned in .iij.
maners. That is to vnderſtande in pryde whan they
myſtoke the cōmaundement of god. And in couetyſe
whan they were not contente of y• / that god vnto thē
had gyuen / and in the ſynne of the mouthe in etynge
the fruyte that god them had defended. ¶ Mayſter
whan yt he repented hym: & alſo dyd grete penaunce / 
wherfore was he not reſtablyſſhed after his dethe in
his fyrſt eſtate. My chylde for as moche as y• penaū
               te
was not ſuffycyent to the reparacyon of all thoſe yt
               
he had put from paradyſe by his ſynne wherefoore
was neceſſarye that the ſeconde perſone in trynytee
whiche is the bleſſyd ſone of god made the reparacyon
for hym / and how be it that the bleſſyd god is euer
more mercyfull / he is ryghtwyſe and reaſonable.
¶ Mayſter wherfore ſente not god an aungell for to
bye humayne lynage. My chylde for as moche that
yf the aungell had redemyd the man / he had ben ſubiecte
vnto the aungell and god hath made the man to
be in the ſtate of aungells. And alſo it was conuenable
ſythe the man hadde done the ſynne that the man
hym repayred / and alſo my chylde thou ſholdeſt knowe
& vnderſtande that the bleſſyd ſone of god in propre
perſone wolde repayre the helth and ſynne of man
and to bere the penaunce and to ſuffre dethe and paſſyon
ryght dolorous for hym and to humble hym to take
our fragylyte and nature in the wombe vyrgynall
for to ſhewe the grete affeccyon and the greate loue y•
he hath towarde vs the whiche he made vnto his ſemblaunce.
¶ Mayſter wherfore ne made god that an
aungell toke nature humayne. My chylde for theyſe
cauſes that I haue now telled the / and alſo for none
aungell ne other creature ne had puyſſaunce to open
paradyſe but god all onely / & it was cloſe vnto ye man
by his treſpace / wherfore it was of neceſſyte that the
ſonne of god were ſente downe here alowe for to redeme
nature humayne / and for to open hym paradyſe / 
And knowe thou that he hadde in hym two natures.
That is to vnderſtande nature dyuyne / for he was
and is very god / and nature humayne / for he was &
is very man / and for as moche vaynquyſſhed he the
deuyll the whiche had vaynquyſſhed the man & opened

paradys and was of the lygne of Adam and dyd
for hym penaunce. ¶ Mayſter wherfore ne toke the
fader & the holy gooſt nature humayne as well as ye
ſone. My chylde for that / yt the ſone is the ſemblaunce
of the fader and graunteth vnto hym all thynges
by the whiche it was a thynge conuenable yt the ſone
all onely drewe vnto hym the man for to drawe hym
vnto his fader aboue in paradyſe.

            MAyſter wherefore
wolde god be
borne of ye vyrgyn Mary.
My chylde god made
the man in foure maners.
The fyrſte was
wtout man & wtout woman
as Adam. The .ij.
was of a man without
woman as Eue. The
.iij. was of the man and
of ye woman as we ben
Now was to make the
iiij. maner the which is
of the woman which is
man as is Iheſu cryſt. And the other reaſon is ſuche
for lykewyſe as the dethe come in erthe by ye woman
the whiche was Eue. Alſo ye lyfe came in to the erthe
by the woman. That is to knowe the bleſſyd Vyrgyn
Mary the whiche vs hath borne the frute of lyfe
eternall. ¶ Mayſter how chylded ſhe. My chylde
ſhe chylded wtout payne and wtout dolour and abode
entyer vyrgyn / & pure / & clene from all ſpotte before
the chyldynge / at the chyldynge / & alter the chyldynge

as the glaſſe thorowe the whiche ye ſonne paſſeth
without makynge therin any openynge. But for as
moche as god wolde holde the ordre of nature he abode
nyne monethes in the wombe vyrgynal / & he walked
not incontynent that he was borne. ¶ Mayſter
at what houre was he borne. My chylde he was borne
at mydnyghte / and at that houre appered in the
ſkye a ſtarre moche fayre and clere that it was marueylous
to be holde / the ſonne was fayre as ye golde / 
and peace and vnyte was thorowe oute the worlde / 
and obeyed vnto one onely prynce the which was named
Ceſar / & at that houre the dombe beeſtes ſpake / 
& Idolles of the ſarazyns & paynyms fell to the erthe
¶ Mayſter wherefore toke he the gyftes of the thre
kynges. My chylde for in takynge the golde he ſhewed
yt he was kȳge almyghtly / and by the enſence yt
he was wery god: & by the myrre very man / and the
kynge the whiche bare the golde was called Balthaſar / 
and Iaſper bare the myrre / & Melchyor bare the
enſence. ¶ Mayſter in howe many maners ben our
ſynnes pardoned. My chylde they ben pardoned vs
in .v. maners. Firſt by the ſacramētes of holy chyrch
y• whiche ben .vij. that is to knowe baptym / confyrmacyon / 
confeſſyon / the order of preeſthode / the ſacrament
of the auter / the ſacrament of mariage / and the
vnccyon / but baptym is the fyrſt / & that the whiche
mooſt clenly putteth oute the ſynnes / and after baptym / 
confyrmacyon and confeſſyon ben the mooſt neceſſaryes.
Secondly our ſynnes vnto vs ben pardoned
by almeſdede. Thyrdely by oryſon
                  •
                / and by faſtynges.
Fourthlye by pardonynge vnto oure enmyes / 
& fyfthely by charyte. ¶ Mayſter ben all our ſynnes

pardoned by baptym. My chylde ye / for by baptym
we ben as men vnto Ieſu cryſte in doynge hym
this homade / & we ben delyuered from ye ſeruytude
of ſynne. ¶ Mayſter wherfore ben they baptyſed the
whiche ben borne of thē yt ben baptyſed / & alſo ye chyldren
the whiche haue nothynge offended. My chylde
if any paaſt were corrupte with venym all the breed
y• whiche of it ſholde be made ſhold be venymous and
corrupte. And for as moche as our fore fathers were
corrupte by ſynne they and all theyr 
                  •
               ygnee were banyſſhed
out of paradys terreſtre / & vnto theym were
ſhytte the gate of paradyſe celeſtyall / the whiche ne
may be opened vnto the man / yf he be not firſt baptyſed
as wytneſſyth the holy ſcrypture / and how be it
yt the father and the mother ben baptyſed yt ſuffyſeth
not vnto the chylde for to be baptyſed / for whā a mā
him baptyſeth / nature comune ne baptyſed hym but
all onely the perſone pertyculer / wherfore it is of neceſſyte
that we ben all baptyſed in pertyculer. ¶ Maſter
wherefore ne named god that all were baptyſed
to be ſaued. My chylde hit is not the deuaute of god
that all ne byn baptyſed / for he hath gyuen vnto euery
man and woman lyberall arbytre and fre wyll y•
to do. Alſo baptyme ſholde be made of free wyll and
without conſtraynt for yf god conſtrayned the man
to be baptyſed he had not his lyberall arbytre / and
ſo all his baptyme had no meryte. ¶ Mayſter wherefore
eſpouſeth not man now his coſynes as in the aū
               cyent
lawe. My chylde hit is for to encreace amyte &
loue betwene ſtraungers / For thoſe the whiche ben
of blode loueth eche other Inoughe more than theſe
other / wherfore it behoueth for to put loue & charyte

where it is not / and the other reaſon is ſuche. For the
chyldren had two proximitis togyders as to be ſone
and neuew wherfore for honeſte it was ordeyned to
make maryage betwene eſtraungers / but in the olde
lawe men eſpouſed the women of lygnage / & it was
for to multyplye & to encreaſe ye worlde. ¶ Mayſter
wherfore was Iheſu cryſte baptyſed. my chylde he
was circumſyzed for to accomplyſſhe the olde lawe.
and baptyzed for to begyn the new lawe & for to ſhewe
his grete humylyte in gyuynge vs example that
we all ſholde be regenerate by baptym. ¶ Mayſter
wherfore is baptym in water. my chylde for that water
is contrary vnto fyre / wherfore for to quenche the
ſayd fyre of ſynne we ben baptyſed in water. And in
lykewyſe as the water waſſheth all ordures and fylthes.
Alſo the baptym waſſheth all ſynnes / and god
theym eſtablyſſhed in water for as moche as the water
is comune ouer all the worlde to the ende yt a man
fynde the ſoner water of ye ſayd ſacrament to ye ende yt
none ne may excuſe hym that he ne coude fynde wherof
that he myght make hym to be baptyſed or that he
myght haue. ¶ Mayſter what worde ought a man
to ſpeke in baptym. My chylde a man oughte to ſaye
thus. I baptyſe the in the name of the father / & of the
ſone / and of the holy gooſt amen. In puttynge thre
tymes of water vpon ye heed of hym that a man baptyſeth / 
and ſo may they ſay in all languages / ſo that
it be in good beleue & in good intencyon & other wordes
the whiche ne ben of the neceſſyte of the ſayd ſacrament
of baptym. ¶ Mayſter was it a thynge reſonable
that god the fader gaue ſo noble thynge as is
the ſone for to by agayne ſo caytyf a thynge as is the

man. My chylde in that vs ſheweth god the father ye
grete and abūdaunt loue that he hath vnto creature
humayne. ¶ Mayſter ſyth yt god hath ſent downe here
alowe his ſonne by ſo grete charyte and for to redeme
ye humaynes wherfore dyd men to hym ſo moche
of payne. My chylde Iudas hym betrayed by couetyſe.
Pylate him cōdēpnyd for drede to leſe his offyce / 
& the Iewes him put to deth by enuy. ¶ Maiſter
wherfore dyed Iheſu cryſte on the tree of the croſſe / 
My chylde for as Adam ſynned by the tree of lyfe. Alſo
god hym wolde bye agayne by the tree of the croſſe
& thou ſholdeſt knowe that by the foure partyes of ye
croſſe the which ſheweth all the worlde / it is agayne
ſhewed vnto vs that the dethe of Ieſu cryſt was ſuffycyent
for to bye not onely nature humayne / but alſo
all the vnyuerſall worlde if it had be loſte. ¶ Mayſter
how longe abode Iheſu cryſte in the erthe deed / 
My chylde he there abode .xl. houres. And whan we
ſay that he aroſe the thyrde day / & that in thre dayes
is nor .xl. houres thou ſholdeſt vnderſtande that he
dyed the fryday at the houre of noone / and all the ſaterdaye
he was deed in the holy ſepulcre ye whiche is
the ſeconde day / and the ſonday after he aroſe ryght
erly / and for as moche as the courſe of nature is renewed
at mydnyght and the daye / in takynge one partye
of the day for all the day entyer. ¶ Mayſter whyther
yede the ſoule of Iheſu cryſt whan he was deed
My chylde he yede in to glory towarde god the fader
in yeldynge vnto hym thankes and prayſynges in demaundynge
hym the holy ſoules the whiche he had
redemed by the meryte of his holy paſſyon / the whiche
thynge god hym graunted. Than opened the ſoule

of Iheſu cryſt the whiche was coniuncte with the
deite the gates of paradys the whiche had ben ſhyt
by longetyme vnto all humayne lygnage / and ye ſaterday
about the houre of mydnyght he deſcended in
to hell and brake the gates & yede to vyſyte his good
frendes. That is to vnderſtande the ſoules of the holy
auncyent fathers the whiche greatly hym deſyred
and theym delyuered frome the pryſon of the lymbe
with all the holy ſoules the which haue meryted paradys
by their holy werkes / and this fayre company
mounted in to heuen and theym preſentyd vnto god
the father the whiche them receyued benygnely and
them putteth in to the realme of paradiſe in ye places
and ſyeges that the curſed Aungelles loſte by theyr
pryde. And he delyuered not the ſoules of the damned
as Iudas / and of the curſyd ryche man dyues and of
many other / but theym he lefte in hell in payne and
in turment with all the deuylles without gyuynge
them ony comforte where they ben yet and ſhalbe for
euer. And on ye ſōday before the ſonne ryſynge returnyd
the ſoule vnto the body of Iheſus that lay in the
Sepulcre / and roſe from dethe vnto lyfe. ¶ Mayſter
wherfore aroſe not he as ſoone as he was deed. My
chylde for a man had lytell preſumed that he had ben
deed / and he wolde begyn for to renewe the worlde
on the Sonday by his reſurreccyon. For at ſuche an
houre all the worlde began to be. ¶ Mayſter where
was he after his 
                  •
               eſurreccyon / forty dayes before
his aſcencyon. My chylde he was in Paradys terreſter.
with Helyas and Enoch in enſtructynge theym
y• which was done as whan he appered. ¶ Mayſter
how many tymes apered he. My chylde / he appered

fyrſt vnto Ioſeph of barmathye y• had buryed hym / 
ye whiche for ſo doynge was put in pryſon. After vnto
his mother: after to the bleſſyd Mawdeleyne: after
vnto the .ij. pylgrymes comynge from the holy ſepulcre:
after to ſaynt Iames the whiche wolde not
ete tyll that he had ſeen hym. After vnto ſaynt Peter
after to the two pylgrymes ye whiche went to the caſtell
of malux after he appered vnto his dyſcyples ye
gates ſhytte: after vnto ſaynt Thomas whan he put
his hande in the ſyde of our lorde Iheſu cryſte: after
vnto his dyſcyples in the ſee of Tyberyon / and ſo my
chylde thou ſhold vnderſtāde yt our lorde Iheſu cryſt
appered .xij. tymes before that he aſcendid in to heuē
¶ Mayſter who aſcēdyd in to heuen with hym. My
chylde the Soules of the bleſſyd the whiche than by
theyr merytes were ſaued / and alſo grete multytude
of aungelles of heuen ye which hym accompanyed in
ſyngynge melodyouſly & yeldynge thankes vnto god
¶ Mayſter wherefore abode he .xl. dayes to mounte
in to heuen after that he was ryſen. My chylde for y•
that he gaue grete payne .xl. houres whan he abode
in the erth vnto his frendes & dyſcyples wherfore he
wolde cōforte them .xl. dayes / that is one day for euery
houre in tokenynge yt for payne he gyueth greate
Ioye / & alſo he dyd it for to conferme them in the holy
faythe / as ſaynt Thomas & other / vnto whom he
apperyd vyſybly. ¶ Mayſter what is that to ſay / yt
the ſone is ſette on the right hande of his father. My
chylde it is to ſaye that ye humanyte is in glory with
the dyuynyte. ¶ Mayſter in what maner and forme
aſcendyd Iheſu cryſte in to heuen. My chylde he ſtyed
in to heuen in ſuche fourme and maner as whan

he hym tranſfygured before ſome of his dyſcyples in
the mountayne of Tabor that is to vnderſtande that
he had the armes ſtretched & lyfte vp in heyght / and
his face ſhynynge as the ſonne. And his veſtemētes
were whyte as ſnowe / and a fayre and clere clowde
deſcendynge from heuen / & it cloſed roūde about hym
and ſo mountyd in to heuen in ſuche wyſe yt they loſt
the ſyght corporall of hym. ¶ Mayſter wherfore is ye
ſacrament of the awter made of breed / and of wyne
My chylde for as the grayne of the corne hath ben beten
and flayled and had the ſede clouen In lykewyſe
the precyous body of Iheſus was beten & ſcourged / 
and had the ſyde opened / out of ye whiche Iſſued blode
and water / wherfore men put water vnto the ſayd
ſacrament. And as the wyne lepeth from ye grape by
force of the wryngyuge in the preſſour. In lykewyſe
the precyous blode of Ieſus lepte from his precyous
body on the preſſour of ye croſſe / and it was not eſtablyſſhed
of the fleſſhe nor of the bloode for a man may
horrour to drynke blode and to ete fleſſhe / but it was
eſtablyſſhed of breed and wyne / that is the mooſt comune
refeccyon that is / and alſo the breed / and the
wyne ben the mooſt comune and the mooſt profytable
for to nouryſſhe the body. In lykewyſe the ſacramente
of the awter is the mooſte commune / and the
mooſt profytable refeccyon for to nouryſſhe the ſoule.
¶ Mayſter howe ſhall we vnderſtande that hit
is the holy bodye of Iheſu cryſte and his precyouſe
bloode vnder the kynde of breed and of wyne. My
chylde as the breed and the wyne that thou eatys &
drynkeſt conuerte theym in to thyne owne bodye and
in to thyn owne bloode. In lykewyſe the ſacrament

of the awter the breed and the wyne ſayenge the holy
wordes by the wyll of god / alſo chaungeth them vnto
the precyous body and blode of Iheſu cryſte. And
alſo he wolde do it for the grete loue that he hathe in
vs he wolde euermore be with vs. And it is in his power
that to do / as of nothynge he hath made all the
worlde ye whiche is a more grete thynge. Than my
chylde thou ſholdeſt beleue ſtedfaſtly and withoute
doubte for his pleaſure was hit to inſtytute in ſuche
wyſe. And how be it that thou ſeeſt it not corporally / 
for a body gloryfyed is inuyſyble thou haſt the more
of meryte. For fayth is none other thynge but to beleue
that thynge that he ſeeth not.

thynges and ſtynkynge leſyth not his clerete / but ye
preeſt it doth vnto his dampnacyō / and yf he be with
out ſynne it is vnto his ſaluacyon. ¶ Mayſter howe
longe abydeth the body of Iheſu cryſte in the wombe
of hym the whiche hym receyueth. My chylde he
there abydeth as longe as the ſubſtaūce of the breed
there may amyde vndegeſted and no more / but thou
ſhalt vnderſtande that god there is and alſo abydeth
euermore with theym the whiche ben in the ſtate of
grace. ¶ Mayſter / whā many preſtes ſyngeth maſſe
the bodye of cryſte is it ouer all / My chylde / ye / For
god is and maye be ouer all as thy ſoule the whiche
is hoole in euerye partye of the bodye. ¶ Mayſter
ſhold a man hate the yll. My chylde a man ſholde hate
theyr curſydnes and folyes and not to do euyll as
they done / but we ſholde loue oure nature / for we be
all ye ſones of one father and of one mother & bought
and redemed with one ſelfe blode / and if they doo the
ony wronge thou ſholdeſt pardon them and praye for
theym vnto the example of Iheſu cryſt / the whiche
prayed for them that him crucyfyed and put vnto the
dethe. For it is the werke mooſte merytoryous that
we maye do. ¶ Mayſter wherfore haue the euyll ſo
many of goodes and of proſperytees in this worlde.
My chylde there is not ſo yll in this worlde but that
ſomtyme dothe ſome good dede. And for as moche as
man dyde neuer any good dede but that it were recō
               penſed / 
nor neuer dyd euyll but that hit be punyſſhed
And for this cauſe god them ſendeth of grete goodes
& proſperytees in retrybucyon of theyr good dede / &
ſo vnto them gyueth puyſſaunce & auctoryte vpon ye
               
good to the ende y• the good ben proued by them / and
ſometyme god ſendeth trybulacyon vnto the yll / to
thende that they amende them / and yf they do it not
neuertheleſſe that ſhall be in dymynucyō of theyr ſynnes
that they ſhold ſuffer & haue in hell. Or they ſhal
haue encreaſynge of other grete goodes temporals / 
but god gyueth of trybulacyons & aduerſytees vnto
the good for to proue them as vnto Iob / & vnto Thobye
to the ende y• they dyſprayſed the vanytes of this
worlde / & that they ſholde not forgete theyr creature
and that by theyr merytes in takynge all in pacyence
they may haue the glorye of paradyſe / and ſomtyme
god theym gyueth of goodes to thende yt they be the
more charytable and that they augment in glorye in
paradys. The good dyeth ſomtyme anone to the ende
that they empeyre not for to auoyde the perylles &
temptacyons the which ben in this worlde / and alſo
ye good lyueth ſomtyme longely for to encreace theym
in bounte / & to thende that by theyr good example &
doctryne the ylle may amende them / and alſo the ylle
dyeth anone ſometyme for to make theſe other ylle a
ferde to ye ende that they amende them / and ſomtyme
the ylle lyueth longely for to proue the good / and alſo
for god taryeth that they ſholde amende them / and ſo
thou ſholde vnderſtande my chylde yt the opynyon of
ſome doctours is yt ye mercy of god is ſo grete yt he ſuffreth
euermore ye man to dye in ye beſt eſtate & purpoſe
that he may fynde hym. For god wyll not ne alſo ſuffreth
not the dethe & dāpnacion of a man / but wylleth
that conuerte hym & lyue eternally in paradys / and
how be it that many dyeth ſodeynly & wtout hauyng
ſpace to confeſſe them & to do penaunce & ſatyſfaccyō
               
How be it vnto ſuche purpoſe may they dye and in ſo
grete contrycyon of herte that god them taketh vnto
mercy. ¶ Maſtier ſhall the ryche & the poore be egallye
guerdoned & rewarded. My chylde of as moche
as they be the more ſage and ye more dygne of as moche
ſhall they be the better rewarded whā they ſhall
be good / and whan they ſhall mowe be euyll of vs
moche ſhall they be the more greuouſlye punyſſhed.
¶ Mayſter maye god do euyll. my chylde / nay: for
how be it that he be all puyſſaunt / neuertheleſſe it is
not entendyd that he may do thynges contrarye vnto
reaſon / and that they ben Impoſſyble for to be.
¶ Mayſter wherfore ſuffreth god yt the beeſtes haue
ſo moche of payne / and alſo they haue not deſerued it
my chylde it is ſomtyme that by ye ſynne of the man
the vengeaūce of god falleth vpon the beeſtes & vpon
theyſe other goodes to the ende that he amende hym
or for to proue hym as Iob. And alſo than beeſtes bē
made to ſuſteyne & to nouriſſhe the man by ye whiche
they ben vnder his ſubieccyon. And alſo for all thynges
ſholde ſerue vs to that wherunto they ben ordeyned / 
as the brydge the whiche is made to paſſe / or to
go ouer. In lykewyſe my chylde god it ſuffreth to
thende that therby we take example / for ſyth that ye
beeſtes ſuffreth ſo moche of payne for theyr poore lyfe
corporall / we ſhold well more trauayle and take payne
to gete the lyfe eternall of paradys in the whiche
a man ſhall lyue eternallye. ¶ Mayſter knoweth
god whether that a man ſhall be ſaued or dampned
before that he be borne. My chylde yes / not that god
it dothe in entencyon for to dampne hym / for god ne
dampnyth hym but ye man dampnith hymſelfe with

out ony conſtraynt but of his owne wyll the whiche
is at his owne lyberall arbytre or fre wyll. As we ſe
the boterflye ye whiche of hym ſelfe and of his propre
wyll hym brēneth in the candell. And how be it that
the ſayde boterflye is ſometyme ſcalded wt the fyre of
the candell in ſuche wyſe that often he falleth vnto ye
erthe / alſo he ryſeth agayn the beſt wyſe he can / and
with all his power he putteth hymſelfe agayne in ye
fyre of the candell all holly that he there abydeth / not
withſtandynge that he ſeeth well the daungere. Alſo
done thoſe the whiche dampneth themſelfe / for how
be it that they ſe and knowe the daunger that therin
is / and alſo that they ben often ſcalded by trybulacyous / 
and aduerſytees to thende that they conuert thē
and that by inſpyracyon dyuyne they haue ſome remors / 
how be it for that they ceaſe not tyll vnto that / 
that of theyr owne wyll & wtout ony conſtraynt they
put them ſo depe in ye fyre that they there abyde and
ſhall neuer go forthe. And how be it that good wyll of
ſymple wyll yt all men be ſaued and hath one ſo grete
a gyfte as the realme of paradys without ony meryte / 
and by ſuche wyſe my chylde knowe thou yt god
hath made ye man not to thende that he be dampned
but to thende that by his holy operacyōs in ſuffryng
pacyentlye trybulacyons and aduerſytees / and in reſyſtynge
and fyghtynge valyauntlye ayenſt the deuyll / 
the worlde and the fleſſhe / he may meryte to be
ſaued. ¶ Mayſter thoſe ye whiche ben predeſtynate
to be ſaued may they be ſaued without deſeruynge it
& to trauayle therefore. My chylde nay / for god knowith
well that by theyr merytes and trauayles they
ſhall be ſaued. And in lykewyſe may a man ſay of the

dampnyd. ¶ Mayſter ſyth that thoſe the whiche bē
predeſtynate to be ſaued may they not be dāpned and
thoſe ye whiche ſhold be dampned may they be ſauyd
what auayleth it elles ſo moche to trauayle for to haue
paradys or hell. My chylde if thou be predeſtynate
to be ſaued in the glorye eternall thou ſholdeſt not
encreaſe thy paynes in purgatory / & to leſſe thy glory
in paradys by faute to do well / & yf thou be predeſtynate
to be dāpned thou ſholdeſt not therfore euermore
lyue in ſynne / but thou ſholdeſt euermore enforce ye
to do well / & to do penaunce for to leſſe thy paynes in
hell & for as moche as thou knoweſt not whereunto
thou art deſtynate / thou ſholde alwayes thynke on ye
better ꝑty yt is to vnderſtāde yt god the hath made vnto
his ſēblaunce / & hath bought ye with his precyous
blode for to ſaue ye & not to dampne the. wherfore my
chylde thou ſhold euermore do good dedes & to fle the
yll & knowe thou my chylde yt god ye hath gyuē wytte
& vnderſtādynge reaſon & fre wyll & lyberall arbytre
to choſe the good or ye yll to thende that thau haue not
ony cauſe of Ignoraunce or of Impuyſſaūce. ¶ Maſter
what ſay ye of them ye which neuer hereth the cō
               maundementes
of god ne none they done. My chylde
the men ben made vnto the Image & vnto ye ſemblaūce
of god to thende yt they hym loue ſerue & drede
and therfore if they knowe not theyr creature in this
worlde we ſhall not knowe them in ye other / ne yet by
theyr Ignoraunce they ſhall not be excuſed but more
ſoner accuſyd / for ye Ignoraūce excuſyth not ye ſynne.
¶ Mayſter yf a chylde were nouryſſhed in a wood &
he had neuer harde ſpeke of the fayth of Ieſu cryſte
ſhal he be dāpned yf y• he dye in ſuche wyſe. My chylde

it is a thynge to beleue yt god maketh reuelacyō vnto
euery perſone of ye fayth of Ieſu cryſt by techynge
of man or by reuelacyon dyuyne or otherwyſe / & if he
go ayenſt the ſayd reuelacyon knowe thou yt he ſhall
be dampned. ¶ Mayſter ben the ſoules made from ye
begynnynge of the worlde. My chylde nay / but god
them createth all the dayes & thē putteth in ye bodyes
of ye chyldren wtin the wombe of theyr moder that is
to vnderſtāde vnto men at .xl. dayes after theyr cōcepcyon.
Mayſter what auayleth vs cōfeſſyō. My chylde
it is the ſecōde baptym. For in lykewyſe as by baptym
all ſynnes be pardoned. In lykewyſe by ye vertu
of the ſacrament of cōfeſſyon all our ſynnes be pardoned / 
for as moche as a man knowlegeth his defaute
before god or before his lyeutenaunt for God loueth
more obedyēce thā ſacryfyce / for obedyēce is mother
of all v

by enioynynge of the cōfeſſoure than penaūce don by
wyll. My chylde if thy cōfeſſoure ye hath enioyned in
penaūce one pater n

penaūce / but yf thou ſaydeſt the Pēnr̄ y• which to the
was enioynyd / and yu leueſt to ſay the ſauter or other
many fayre oryſons / yt yu ſayſt by ſymple wyll yu ſhalt
not ſyn̄e / but yu ſhalt acquyte ye of thy penaūce / for as
I haue tolde the more better is obedyēce done to our
lorde than doth the ſacryfyce. ¶ Mayſter what auayleth
contrycion at the poynt of deth. My chylde thoſe
the which abydeth thē to repent tyll vnto ye houre of
deth ben trechoures vnto our lord as the trechoure &
yll payer yt promyſeth for to paye at a certayne terme
but he wolde that the terme ſholde neuer come / and

for this mater & cauſe he maketh a .M. trecheryes vnto
his creature to thende that he ne paye hym ſo ſone
or neuer / and of ye other parte ſaynt Luke ſayth that
god is not well payed of hym the which hym payeth
of that thynge yt he ne may no lenger holde. Howe be
it / it is wryten that at what houre yt the ſynner ſhall
declare his ſynne in grete repentaunce and cōtrycyō
that it vnto hym ſhall be pardoned. But my childe it
is a ryght grete parell to abyde hym to repēt / for thā
a man is ſo troubled that a man knoweth not hymſelfe
nor none other / for as ſayth the pſalmys (Om̄
               nō
eſt in morte q memor ſit tui: in iferno aūt quis confitebitur
tibi) That is to ſay yt as the deed man hath
no remembraunce of god / and that is no tyme hym to
repent and to confeſſe his ſynne whan that a man is
in hell for the ſentēce of god is gyuen. Than my chylde
thou ſhold repent & cōfeſſe ye whā thou haſt tyme &
ſpace / & thou ſholdeſt not tarye tyll to morowe / for yu
knoweſt not whether
thou ſhalte deye to morowe
or ſooner.

which is a chambre of hell where they haue no Ioye
nor heuynes / for they haue nothynge meryted / but
for as moche as they be not purged frome orygynall
ſyn̄e by baptym they be put from paradys / & from ye
vyſyon of god / and the ſoules of them the whiche ben

gooth in to paradys all ryght / and the ſoules of them
the whiche dyeth in the ſtate of grace & without ſyn̄e
where if they haue ſynned and if they haue done penaunce
ſuffycyent in this worlde gooth all ryghte in

purgatory & there they accomplyſſhe theyr penaunces

go in to the glory of paradys. And the ſoules of them
the whiche dyeth in one mortall ſynne or many goth

¶ Mayſter in how lytell tyme ben the ſoules delyuered
from purgatory. My chylde ſome there abydeth
more longely than other after as they haue deſerued
for ſome ben delyuered at ye ende of .vii. dayes / & therfore
maketh a man the ſemell otherwyſe called the returne
in makynge prayers & almeſdedes for their delyueraunce / 

for greatlye vnto them may profyte the
prayers & almeſdedes that is done for them. Theſe
other ben delyuered at the ende of .xxx. dayes / & therfore
is made the trentall. Theſe other ben delyuered
at the ende of one yere / & therfore is made the yeres
mynde / & theſe other abydeth there by many yeees / 
& by longe tyme after yt they haue deſeruyd / & therfore
make men remembraunce euery yere of them / and
whan they ben all purged & that they ben delyueryd
as by theyr penaūces accomplyſſhed / as by our prayers
and orayſons / they go all ryght vnto the glory of
paradys. ¶ Mayſter in what place is paradys. My
chylde there ar .iij. maner of paradys / that is to wyte
paradys celeſtyall / paradyſe terreſtre / and paradys
ſpirituall. Paradyſe celeſtyal is aboue all the heuens
in the whiche is god and all ye ſayntes holy men and
women as I haue ſayd before / paradyſe terreſtre is
in the erth towarde the oryent / & paradys ſpyrytuall
is ayenſt god / & to loue hym perfytely & yt is ouer all
In that paradys ben our good aūgelles ye whiche ſeeth
& loueth god. ¶ Mayſter where is hell. My chylde
there are .ij. maner of helles / yt is to wyte hel ſpirituall
& hell corporall / hell ſpūall is ouer all where the
ſoules & ye curſed aungels bē in payne & tourment be
it in erth or in ye ſee / & this may be in many places / as
we rede of a ſoule that was turmēted wt a flage of yſe
ye a byſſhop delyuered by .xxx. maſſes / who was boū
               de

place wherin were the holy ſoules of ye holy fathers
aūcyētes & of them yt by theyr holy lyfe & cōuerſacion

haue meryced the realme of paradys the whiche our
lorde Iheſu cryſt delyuered whan he dyed on the tre
of the croſſe and now there is none / For at that tyme
were all delyuered. At the ſeconde ſtage is purgatory
wherin the ſoules the whiche ſholde be ſaued goth to
accomplyſſhe theyr penaūce the which they haue not
accomplyſſhed in this worlde in theyr lyfe. In ye .iij.
ſtage ben the ſoules of the Innocentes the whiche
dyeth without baptym. And ī the .iiij. ſtage ye which
is the mooſt lowe in depnes ben the deuylles and the
ſoules of the poore & myſerable dampned.

            MAiſter what
paynes haue
they ye which bē
in purgatorye. My
chylde they ben turmented
with the fyre
of hell moche more
hotter than ye fyre
matery all of this
preſent worlde in cōparyſon
ayenſt a fyre
paynted vpon a
wall / and they ben
there bounde with
chaynes of fyre all
brennyng ſo ſperke
lynge that a man ne
can ſpeke it. In the
whiche place ſome ben there more punyſſhed than

theſe other / and there abyde more longely than the other
after as they haue deſerued. ¶ Mayſter what
payne is there in hell. My chylde there are ſoo many
dyuers paynes & tourmentes yt there is none entendement
humayne ye which can comprehēde ne Imagen
as of fyre ſtynkynge and ryght brennynge / of todes / 
ſerpentes / dragons / and of al foule and cruell beſtes / 
& of deuylles enraged & wode the whiche neuer
ben wery for to bete & tourment the poore & myſerable
dāpned / but euermore ben for to begynne in ſuche
wyſe that the leeſt payne of hell ſurmounteth all the
paynes of this world / but the one is more punyſſhed
than the other after their deſert / and at the day of Iugement
theyr payne ſhall doubte / for than they ſhall
aryſe & ſhall be dampned in body & in ſouſe. ¶ Mayſter
what payne haue the ſoules of the Innocentes y•
which dyeth wtout baptym. My chylde they ne haue
payne / ne doloure / ne Ioye / ne gladnes. For they neuer
dyd good nor euyll / by ye which they haue not meryted
to haue ony good / ne to haue ony euyll & howe
be it yt the place wherin they ben be dym & derke. All
be it there is nothynge the which them greueth / and
whan the day of Iugement ſhall come that they ſhal
ryſe they ſhall be of the aege that oure lorde Iheſu
cryſte was whan he dyed on the tre and all the other.
Alſo the ſayd chyldren not baptyſed ſhall be contente
with the ordenaūce of god / & thā ſhall returne agayn
in to theyr ſayd place without euer to haue Ioy ne heuynes
no more than thou haſt of that / ye thou haſt no
wynges for yt apertayneth vnto ye byrdes & not vnto
men / or as thou haſt whā a kynge or ony grete prynce
dyeth & thou ſhalte not ſuccede his realme & ſyng
               
                  •
               ourye

for thou knoweſt well thou arte not he the
which ſholde enheryte. Alſo they ſholde not enheryte
the gloryous realme of Paradyſe for they ben exyled
by ye ſynne of Adā & of Eue / of the whiche ſynne they
haue not ben purged by baptyme. ¶ Mayſter thoſe
of paradys ſe they thoſe of hell. My chylde ye / and y•
vnto them is a grete encreaſynge of glory whan they
ſe the paynes yt they haue eſcaped wherof they thanke
god without ceaſyng / and alſo the dampned ſeeth
the ſaued in paradys as we haue in the goſpell of the
curſed ryche man Dyues the whiche ſawe the ſoule
of the poore Lazare in the boſome of Abraham in paradys / 
the whiche thynge is to them a grete encreaſynge
of theyr doloure & anguyſſhe whan they ſe the
grete goodes ſpyrytuall that they haue loſt by theyr
ſynnes & by theyr neclygēce / & after the day of Iugemente
as the bodyes of the ſaued ſhall be gloryfyed / 
they ſhall ſe the dāpned corporally / but the dampnyd
may not ſe them corporally. ¶ Maiſter ben the ſaued
wroth of the payne of the dampned. My chylde they
that ben in paradys wolde well that thoſe the which
ben in hell hadde ſoo well lyued whan they were in
this worlde / that by theyr holy werkes they had ben
ſaued with them. For without ceaſynge they praye
for the humaynes lyuynges within this p̄ſent world
but ſythen that they by their curſyd lyfe and by theyr
Synnes they ben dampned for euer / theyſe of paradyſe
neyther ben heuy nor dyſpleſaunt. For in Paradyſe
there is not of heuynes / nor of dyſpleaſaunce of
ony manes thynge. But all Ioye / myrthe / and gladneſſe
without ende. ¶ Mayſter the auncient fathers
ſuffred they ony maner of payne in the lymbe of hell

My chylde nay / but all onely that they were holden
in derkenes and in captyuyte. And were put from the
vyſyon of god and aboue euermore theyr delyueraū
               ce.
¶ Mayſter what knowlege haue the Iuſte the
whiche ben in paradys. My chylde they knowe the
good & theyr merytes & of the curſyd alſo / and ye curknoweth
wherfore they ben dampned / & knoweth
as we that thynge that they ſe and feele. And thoſe of
purgatory ne knoweth nothynge of this worlde / yf
it be not by reuelacyon of aūgels ye whiche them cō
               forteth
or of ye ſayntes of paradys. Theſe of paradys
ſheweth theym whan they wyll / and vnto whome
they wyll / but the dampned ſhall neuer come forthe
of hell tyll vnto the daye of Iugement that they ſhal
come to take agayne theyr bodyes and to here the ſentence
of the ſoueraygne Iuge / & after they ſhall returne
in to hell from whens they ſhall neuermore returne.
And if that it happen ſomtyme that it ſemeth vnto
vs yt they ſhewe them it is but ye deuyll ye whiche
ſheweth them vnto theyr ſemblaunce / yf it be not by
the ſuffraunce of god that they ſhewe them ſomtyme
vnto ſome holy perſones as god it wyll by his myracle
as mē ſayth on many / but it is not at ther wyll
ne they be not eaſed of theyr paynes. For they bere euermore
theyr hell with them / and ſo they ben euer
more in hell. ¶ Mayſter how ſay ye of theſe women
the which ſayth that they them ſe in the ayre of theſe
feyryes / and of theſe gobelyns the whiche them calleth
elues / and many other thynges. My chylde the
women ben mooſt varyables and more lyght of beleue
than men / and therfore was Eue tempted before
Adam. For the ennemy thought well yt whan he had

wonne her that ſhe ſhold helpe hym to wynne Adam
and therfore the deuyll ſhewed more ſoner his vyſyons
vnto women than he dyd vnto men / how be hit
that ſome men of lytell feyth there bē often deceyued
& for as moche that ſome women ben of more lyghte
beleue of as moche the more the deuyll ſheweth of vyſyons
vnto them in theyr mynde for to drawe theym
from the fayth of Iheſu cryſte / And thou ſholdeſt vnderſtande
that theſe olde wytches the whiche ſayth
that they go on the ſatyrday farre from theyr houſes
or that they do or ſe thynges maruaylous that they
ne do nothynge / but by the grete faute of fayth that
they haue and by theyr foly
                  •
               ſhe beleue & for as moch
as they ben in ſynne / for they be Idolatres and with
out fayth the deuyl vnto them ſheweth thoſe folyſſhe
vyſyons in theyr entēdement for the better to brynge
them vnto his lyne / for in trouthe elles they remeue
not from theyr place noo more than doth a ſtone / and
theyr vyſyons ben ſemblables vnto theym of a man
the whiche is dronke / vnto whom it ſemeth that the
houſe turneth vnder his fete / by ye whiche he falleth
and all the houſe ne the erthe remeueth not. In lyke
wyſe the deuyl them ſheweth theſe vyſyons in theyr
entendement / and alſo the deuyll hym ſheweth in the
fourme & ſemblaunce of ſome perſonage / the whiche
they knowe that ſholde be dede .xx. or .xxx. yeres paſt
or in fourme and ſemblaunce of ſome of theyr neyghboures / 
and ſhall ſpeke to them famylyerly as it were
themſelfe to thende that they beleue hym the better / 
& that he deceyue them the more lyghtly / but it is
nothynge ellys but ye deuyll hymſelfe ye whiche hym
ſheweth vnto them in body fantaſtycall as for to deceyue

them / & alſo maketh he y• it vnto theym ſemeth
yt they goo in to a medowe grene full of fayre ſloures
vnto whom they make grete there. But it is nothynge / 
for they ne be put Illuſyons made by the ennemy
of mature that he putteth in theyr entendement / and
it ſemeth them ſomtymes y• they entre in to an houſe
the gates ſhytte / and that they take the gaders of a
chylde & eteth them & goth in to the celler / & drynketh
as moche of the beſt / & of that dede they go awaye wt
out that / yt the chylde hath ony ylle / & that ye wyne is
nothynge ye leſſe in the tonne the whiche is a thynge
Impoſſyble / for all ye ſorcyers of the worlde ne all the
deuylles ne can make paſſe a ryght grete bodye humayne
by a lytell clyfte / ne entre wtin a houſe / but y•
he haue open paſſage for to entre / ne to drawe the entrayles
fro ye body of a chylde wtout kyllynge or hurtynge
it / & whan it ſhall be deed they can not areyſe
it / ne they can not drawe ye wyne of a ton̄e without yt
there be leſſe of one droppe / for they ben werkers yt all
onely ben vnto the puyſſaunce of the ſouerayne creature / 
wherfore my chylde thou ſhold put no fayth vnto
theyr ſorceries & deuynemētes / for they ne ben but
falſe Illuſyōs made by the enemy of nature yt he ſō
               tymes
ſheweth ſomethynges for to come ye which he
knoweth by ſome cōiectures as I haue tolde ye before
in ſpekynge of ye ſcyence of ye deuyll / and ſomtyme the
deuyll vnto them ſhall ſhewe a thefte in ſayenge the
trouthe to thende yt they beleue the better in hym / & y•
the malfactoure be ye more defamed / & alſo ſhall ſaye
often trouthe to thende y• he be ye ſoner beleued whan
by his falſe reuelacyon he ſhall accuſe ſome holy and

                  •
               e not beleue
them / for they ne be but Illyſyons and falſe vyſyons
of the ennemy the which ne doth but lye for to deceyue
the man / & alſo a man ſholde not beleue ſuche people / 
for ye deuyl hath not ony puyſſaūce vpon the man
wt out ſo be yt god hym ſuffre / & vnto the regarde of ye
feyryes the which man ſayth were wonte to be in tymes
paſt / they were not men nor women naturalles
but were deuylles ye which ſhewed themſelfe vnto ye
people of yt tyme for they were paynyms / Idolatres
& wt out fayth / & the ſayd feyryes chaunged theym in
to many fourmes / as of an hors / or of a dogge / or otherwyſe
the which is Impoſſyble vnto nature but
ye deuyll may well ſhewe hym ī many maners & chaū

habyte in takynge the habyte of a relygyous man / or
of a woman / but vnto the trouthe all the wytches of
the worlde ne all ye deuyls of hell can not chaunge one
kynde in to an other / as a man in to a dogge / or a dog
in to an aſſe / for it is Impoſſyble vnto theym yt to do / 
wherfore thou mayſt well thynke yt theyſe feyryes y•
in ſuche wyſe ſhewid them in dyuers fourmes & kyndes
ne were men ne womē / ne other thynge naturall
but were deuylles yt in ſuche wyſe ſhewed them / & ye
whiche put thē in theyr Idolles & ſpake & ſayd ſome
thynges for to come by ſome coniectures / as by the
Influences of the bodyes celeſtyalles / for otherwyſe
ye deuyll hathe no knowlege of thynges for to come &
by this meane ye ſayd feyryes ſayd yt ye people were deſtenyed
ye one vnto good ye other to yll after the courſe
of heuen and of nature / as a chylde borne in ſuche

an houre & at ſuche a courſe / he was deſtenyed to be
hanged or drowned / or yt he ſholde be ryche or poore
or yt he ſholde wedde ſuche a woman / ye whiche thynges
ben falſe / for the man hath in hymſelfe lyberal arbytre
& fre wyll to do good or ylle in ſuche wyſe that
if he wyll he ſhall do nothynge wherfore he ſholde be
hanged / nor yet put hym in the daunger to be drownyd / 
nor alſo he ſhall not marye a woman but yf he
wyll / & ſo hir deſtynacyons ſhall be ſelfe. By theyſe
reaſons a man ſholde put to no faythe / for as ſayth ye
pſalmyſte (Vir ſapiens dominabitur aſtris) That is
to ſay / that the wyſe man ſholde haue lordeſhyp aboue
the ſterres and planettes / For he ſhall not gouerne
hym after his ſenſualyte and inclynacyon naturall / 
but he ſholde gouerne hym wyſely by reſon folowynge

is ſo free yt nothynge may not make hit vnfree / & yf yt
man ſholde do good or euyll by force ageynſt his wyll
he ſholde not haue lyperall arbytre / & ſo his lyfe ſhold
haue no meryte / the which thynge is falſe & agaynſt

hit. It is alſo defendyd vpon the payne of dethe / 
and of dampnacyon eternall / and in regarde of theſe
wordys / and of theſe ſpyrytes and elues / and alſo of
many other vyſyōs that men ſay yt they ſe by nyght
they ben often deuylles that put theym in fourme of
ſome deed body in faynyng his voyce to tempte ye perſone
