               THat which heretofore I haue propounded to you (right Worſhipfull & beloued) in teaching, I doe now publiſh to all men by printing, to wit, mine opinion of the vnlawfulnes of Games conſisting in chance. My deſire is either information, if I erre in judgment, or reformation, of ſo leud a practiſe. But whether I erre or no (which yet I would gladly vnderstand,Rom. 3. 7. for I ought not to teach an vntruth, though to Gods glorie) yet there is none, zealous indeede against ſin, deſirous from the heart

to reclaime ſinners, and who deeply conſidereth the greiuous abuſes, which accompanie dicing and carding, (as horrible ſwearing, dangerous quarelling, loſſe (I ſay not of good houres, but) of nights and daies, & the pitifull vndoeing of too too manny) but will remember that all things are not1. Cor. 6. 12. expedient, which are lawfull, and therefore abſtaine from ſuch Heathenish paſtimes, that ifby their example they cannot reforme,1. Cor. 8. 9. they may be ſure they doe not confirme gamesters in their inordinate walking. Which reſpect▪ the 7. Iniunction forbidding Miniſters to vſe theſe vnlawfull games, may beſuppoſed to haue. Now that which authoritie exacteth of Miniſters, doth Religion require of all true Profeſſors. For as the one are to be enſamples to the flocke,1. Tit. 5. 3. Phil. 1. 5. 1. Cor. 8 10. 13. ſo the other are to be lights in the world. And therefore as Paul ſaith, If meate offend my brother, I will eate no fleſh while the world ſtandeth: ſo euery true Chriſtian ſhould ſay, and that with more reſolution (for Play is not ſo neceſſarie as meate) If

play offend my brother, who ſeeing me▪ hauing knowledge, play, is boldned to follow gaming, I will not play while the world ſtandeth.

            A ſhort and plaine Dialogue concerning the vnlawfulnes of playing at Cards or Tables, or any other game conſiſting of chance.
            
               Profeſſor.
               
                  SIR, howſoeuer I am perſwaded by that which I reade in the common places of Peter Martyr, par. 2. pag. 525. b. that Dice (condemned both by the Civill lawes, and by the Fathers) are therefore vnlawfull, becauſe they depend vpon chance: yet not ſatisfied with that which he writeth of Table-playing, pag. 526. b. I would crauē your opinion concerning playing at Tables and Cards.
            
            
               Preacher.
               Sauing the iudgement of ſo excellent a Diuine, ſo farre as I can learne out of Gods word,

Cardes and Tables ſeeme to me
                     •
                   no more lawfull (though leſſe offenſiue) than Dice. For Tableplaying is no whit the more lawfull becauſe Plato compares the life of man thereunto, than a theefe is the more iuſtifiable, becauſe Chriſt compareth his ſecond comming,

Cor. 11. 15. not to be vſed in ſport.
            
            
               Prof.
               For my better inſtruction, proue that Lots are not to be vſed in ſport.
            
            
               Preach.
               Conſider with regard

theſe three things: First, that we
                     •
                  
                  1. reade not in the Scripture that Lots were vſed but only in ſerious matters both by the Iewes, Ioſ. 18. 10. and Gentiles, Ion. 1. 9. Secondly,
                  2. that a Lot in the nature therof doth as neceſſarily ſuppoſe the ſpecial prouidence & determining preſence of God, as an oath in the nature therof doth ſuppoſe the teſtifying preſence of God. Yea ſo, that (as in an oath, ſo) in a lot prayer is expreſſed, or to bee vnderſtood, 1. Sam. 14. 41. Thirdly,
                  3. that the proper end of a Lot (as of an oath, Heb. 6. 16.) is to end a controverſie: and therefore for your bettet inſtruction examine theſe reaſons. Whatſoeuer directly, or1. of it ſefe, or in a ſpeciall manner, tendeth to the advancing of the name of God, is to be vſed religiouſly, Mal. 1. 6. 7. and not to be vſed in ſport: as wee are not to pray

or ſweare in ſport, Exod. 20. 7. Eſa▪ 29. 13. Ier. 4. 2. but the vſe of Lots, directly of it ſelfe and in a ſpeciall manner tendeth to the aduancing of the name of God, in attributing to his ſpeciall prouidence in the whole and immediate diſpoſing of the Lot, and expecting the euent, Pro. 16. 33. Act. 1. 24. 26. Therefore the vſe of Lots is not to be in2. ſport. Againe we are not to tempt the Almightie by a vaine deſire of manifeſtation of his power and ſpeciall prouidence, Pſal. 78. 18. 19. Eſa▪ 7. 12. Matth. 4. 6. 7. But by vſing Lots in ſport we tempt the almightie, vainly deſiring the manifeſta
                     •
                   of his ſpeciall prouidence in his immediate3. diſpoſing, Therfore, &c. Laſtly, whatſoeuer God hath ſanctified to a proper end is not to bee peruerted to a worſe, Matth. 21. 12. 13. But God hath ſanctified Lots to a proper end, namely to end

troverſies, Num. 26. 55. Pro. 18. 18. therefore man is not to peruert them to a worſe: namely to play, & by playing to get away another mans money, which without controuerſie is his owne. For the common ſaying is, Sine lucro friget luſus, No gaining, cold gaming.
            
            
               Profeſ.
               God hath ſanctified Pſalmes to the praiſe of his name, & bread & wine to repreſent the bodie & bloud of our crucified Sauiour, which be holie ends: and the children of God may ſing Pſalmes to make themſelues merrie in the Lord, and feede vpon bread & wine not only for neceſsitie but to cheere themſelues; why then may not Gods children recreate themſelues by lotterie notwithſtanding God hath ſanctified the ſame to end a controuerſie?
            
            
               Preach.
               Becauſe we finde not in the Scriptures any diſpenſation for recreation by lotterie, as wee doe for godlie mirth by ſinging, Iam. 5. 13. and for religious and ſober

cheering our ſelues by eating and drinking, Deut. 8. 9. 10. And therefore (it being withall conſidered that the ends you ſpeake of, be not proper, though holy) it followeth, that God who only diſpoſeth the Lot touching the euent, and is therefore a principall actor, is not to bee ſet on worke by lotterie in any caſe, but when hee diſpenſeth with vs, or giueth vs leaue fo to doe: But diſpenſation for recreation by lotterie cannot be shewed, Therefore, &c.
            
            
               Profeſ.
               Lots may be vſed for profit in a matter of right, Num. 26. 55. why not for pleaſure?
               
            
            
               Preach.
               Then oathes may be vſed for pleaſure, for they may fot profit, in a matter of truth, Exod. 22. 8. 11. But indeede lots (as oathes) are not to bee vſed either for profit or pleaſure, but onely to end a coutrouerſie.
            
            
               
               Profeſ.
               The wit is exerciſed by Tables and Cards, therefore they be no lots.
            
            
               Preach.
               Yet lotterie is vſed by caſting Dice, and by shuffling and cutting the Cards before the wit is exerciſed. But how doth this follow? Becauſe Cards and Tables bee not naked Lots, conſiſting only in chance (as Dice doe) they are therefore no lots at all. Although (being vſed without cogging, or packing) they conſiſt principally in chance, and thefore from thence they are to receiue their denomination. In which reſpect a Lot is called in Latin Sors, that is, chance or hazard, and Lyra vpon Prou. 16. ſaith, To vſe Lots, is, by a variable euent of fome ſenſible thing, to determine ſome doubtfull or vncertaine matter, as to draw cutts, or to caſt Dice.
            
            But whether you will call Cards

and Tables Lots, or no, you play with chance or vſe Lotterie. Then conſider whether exerciſe of wit doth ſanctifie playing with lotterie, or playing with lotterie make ſuch excerciſing of wit, a ſinne, Hag. 2. 13. 14. For as a calling God to witnes by vaine ſwearing is a ſinne, 2. Cor. 1. 13. ſo making God an vmpire, by playing with lotterie, muſt needs be a ſinne: yea, ſuch a ſin as maketh the offender (in ſome reſpects) more blame-worthy. For there be more occaſions of ſwearing than of lotterie. Secondly, vaine oathes moſt commonly ſlip out at vnawares, whereas lots cannot be vſed but with deliberation. Thirdly, ſwearing is to ſatiſfie other, wheras this kind of lotterie is altogether to fulfill our own luſt. Therefore take heede, that you bee not guiltie of peruerting the ordinance of the Lord, of taking

the name of God in vaine, and f tempting the Almightie, by a 
                  •
               ameſome putting of things to haard, and making play of lotterie, xcept you thinke that God hath o gouvernment in vaine actions, r hath diſpenſed with ſuch lewd 
                  •
               ames.
            
               Profeſ.
               In ſhooting there is a chance, 
                     •
                   a ſudden blast, yet ſhooting is no loterie.
            
            
               Preach.
               It is true, for that chance 
                     •
                  ommeth by accident, and not of 
                     •
                  he nature of the game, to be 
                     •
                  ſed.
            
            
               Profeſ.
               Lots are ſecret, and the whole diſpoſing of them is of God, Pro 16. 33. 
                  
                     •
                  ut it is otherwiſe in Tables and Cards.
            
            
               Preach.
               Lots are caſt into the 
                     •
                  ap by man, and that openly, leſt conveiance ſhould be ſuſpected: 
                     •
                  ut the diſpoſing of the chance is ſecret, that it may be chance indeede, and wholly of God, who directeth

all things, Prou. 16. 13. 9. 33 So in Tables, man by faire caſting Dice truly made, and in Cardes by shuffling and cutting, doth openly diſpoſe the Dice and Card ſo, as whereby a variable euen may follow: but it is onely and immediatly of God, that the Dice be ſo caſt, and the Cards ſo shuffled and cut, as that this or that gam followeth, except there be cogging and packing. So that in faire play mans wit is not exerciſed in diſpoſing the chance, but in making the beſt of it being paſt.
            
            
               Profeſ.
               The end of our play is recreation, and not to make God an vmpire: but recreation (no doubt) is lawfull.
            
            
               Preach.
               It may be the ſouldiers had no ſuch end when they caſt lots for Chriſt his coate, Matth▪ 27▪ 25. but this should be your end when you vſe lotterie, as the end of an oath should be, to call God

to witneſſe. Therefore as ſwearing, ſo Lotterie, without due reſpect is ſinne. Againe, howſoever recreation be your pretended end, yet remember that wee muſt not doe euill that good may come of it, Rom. 3. 8. And that therefore wee are to recreate our ſelues by lawfull recreations. Then ſee how Cardes and Tables be lawfull▪

               Preach.
               Though I am perſwaded that it is not lawfull to play for any money, conſidering thankes cannot be giuen in faith for that which is ſo gotten, De

               Wee muſt liue by precepts, not by examples, except they be vndoubtedly good. Therefore examine whether they be good, and well learned in ſo doing or no. For euery man may erre, Rom. 3. 4.

               It is not good to be too juſt, or too wiſe, Eccl. 7. 18.
               
            
            
               Preach.
               It is not good to be too wicked or too foolish, Eccl. 7. 19. in deſpiſing the word of God, Prou. 1. 22. and not regarding the weakneſſe of others, Rom. 14. 21. Let vs therefore beware

vnpartialleye, and conſider it ſeriouſly, and fin ding that good by it, which is intended, bleſſe God for it, who guideth, and bleſſeth all things to his owne glory, and to the good of his owne.

               Ionah. 1. 7. 
               SOme yeares are paſt ſince Mr. Gataker tooke occaſion, from caſting of Lotts to finde out for whoſe ſake a daungerous ſtorme was, to juſtiſie playing with Dice, Cards, &c. and to confute me by name in open pulpit. I hearing thereof by many, ſent him this meſſage. If it would pleaſe him to ſend the ſubſtance of the Confutation (for I dare not rely vpon report) I would either reply, or chaunge mine opinion

with thankes to God for him; though for the preſent, I thought he failed in Indgment, Diſcretion, and Charity. In Iudgment. Becauſe that Doctrine was not drawne from his Text; Except this be a judicious deduction. Gentiles caſt Lotts in a moſt ſerious matter, therefore Chriſtians may vſe Lottery in dicing, carding, &c. In Diſcretion. Becauſe that Doctrine (though occaſioned by his text, yet) ſo inſiſted vpon, incourageth gameſters in their ſinfull courſe and buildeth vp thoſe abuſes, which the Lawes of our Land, would pull downe. In Charity; Becauſe he confuteth me by name, (as I was certified) not having had any conference with me either by ſpeech, or by writing, though I be his neighbour Miniſter. Well; Mr. Gataker, ſent me his anſwere to my dialogue. I acknowledge it with hearty thankes.

But why have I not replyed in ſo many yeares? I anſwere, Sa

                  itò, ſi ſat benè. To ſpeake freely I thinke, I should never have replied, in hope that the queſtion would have died, had not Mr. Gataker confuted my Dialogue in print▪ But now, the rather, being provoked▪ by many learned Miniſters & other, who tell me, that, ſeeing of all thoſe whom Mr. Gataker confuteth, viz: Peter Martyr, Zuinglius, Cartwright,
               10 1. 
               Danoeus, Perkins, Fenner, &c. I onely live, I ought to reply, leaſt my ſilence should give way to impiousiniquity, I am ready to performe my promiſe in replying. Which (indeed) I could not have done ſo conveniently before, becauſe the anſwer, which Mr. Gataker ſent me, had not the poſitiue groundes of his opinion, which the printed booke hath.
            Before I proceed▪ I proteſt before

God, that I eſteeme Mr. Ga
                  
                     •
                  aker as a learned, painfull, and faithfull Miniſter, and a right honeſt man, and therefore pray thee (Christian Reader) that whatſoever I write may be conſidered as concerning the queſtion betweene vs, and not in any wiſe applied to the leaſt praejudice of ſo reverend a brother, or to any of his excellent parts; So excellent, that I wonder what mooved him to publish his opinion in print, and the more, becauſe of many paſſages in his booke. First, He taketh knowledge1▪
                of many enormous crimes, which accompany Dice, Cardes, &c. pa. 193. & in the quotations. Secondly;
               2. He giveth this rule, That, that, which is no neceſſary duety, but a thing indifferēt onely, otherwiſe, may not be done, where is ſtrōg preſumptiō vpō good ground

yet it shall ſpiritually endanger a mans ſelfe, or others, by giving occaſion of ſinne vnto the one, or the other. pag. 107. 108. 109.
            
            If many and greivous ſinnes attend dice, cardes, &c. If thoſe games be too too commonly abuſed, as he confeſſeth. pa: 194. and if an indifferent thing may not be done which giveth occaſion of ſinne, I wonder why Mr. Gataker writeth in defence of dice, &c. and the more, becauſe he graunteth, that, where the vſe, and abuſe of a thing are ſo inwrapped, and intangled togither, that they cannot eaſily be ſevered the one from the other, then the vſe of the thing it ſelfe, (if it be vnneceſſary otherwiſe) would be wholely abandoned, pag. 262. 263. Thirdly; He sheweth in many pages▪ how ſeverely tables, but eſpecially dice, be condemned by Lawes, Civill, Canonicall, and Municipall,

                Lott is vſed, the lawfuller the Lott

               is, pag. 111. The reaſon, why I wonder at this paſſage, shall be given in my Reply. The laſt paſſage now to be obſerved as matter of my wondering, is this; Notwithſtanding, he confidently affirmeth that we may not doe ought without warrant, pag. 301. Sufficiently confirmeth the ſame, becauſe ſuch an Act is not done of Faith, and therefore not free from ſinne, Rom. 14. 23. but is a mere preſumption, and tempting of God, pag. 313. and quot. A▪
                and B. and Earneſtly reprooveth one kinde of Lottery (why not all, againſt which the ſame reaſon is of like validity?) becauſe not found revealed in any word of God, but brought in either by Sathan, or by ſome of his inſtruments who are addicted to Vanity, pag. 315. and 316. and, yet he avoucheth, That it is a ſufficient warrant for the vſe of Lottes,

In that the oppugners, being learned, can ſay nothing againſt them▪ but what hath beene, or may be ſufficiently anſwered, pag. 235.
            
            May I not wonder that ſo judicious a ſcholler doth not obſerve this diſcrepance? Lottery is vnlawfull, if not warranted by the word which poſitiō ſuppoſeth the Wor
                  •
                to be perfect, as is the Authou

                thereof, and 2. Lottery is lawful
                  •
                if Learned men can ſay nothing ou of the Word againſt it. Which poſition ſuppoſeth two things, viz That the Word is like the Lawes o men, that is, Imperfect, as be the Authours therof; and, That Learne
                  •
                men cannot ſo faile in Diligence o reading, Cleareneſſe of vnderſtanding, and Firmeneſſe of Memory but that▪ if there were in the Wor
                  •
                anything againſt Lottery, the
                  •
                could nor but ſee it. Well; It ma
                  •
                be ſeene shortly, how Mr. Gataker Diligence,

Vnderſtanding, and Memory have ſerved him in defenoing Luſorious Lotts. In the meane while, Sufficiency of his anſwering is but vpon the Triall, and not yet adjudged.
            All theis paſſages well reveiwed by Mr. Gataker I should thinke he cannot wonder that a man of 64. yeares compleate, (and therefore his wittes may faile) doth wonder that ſo godly, wiſe, and learned a man, the faculties of whoſe minde are at the beſt, did not ſay to himſelfe, before he preached, much more before he penned this luſorious doctrine, Let Baal plead forIudg. 6▪ 31.

               ith theis cordes of vanity; and the rather, becauſe he acknowledgeth that accoumpt is to be given vnto God of gaming pa. 261. If of the act

much more of juſtifying it. Fro m which account good Lord deliver me. For I feare, that in iuſtifying luſorious Lottes, I should put falſe ſpectacles on a gameſter's noſe, whereby the bridge ſeemeth broader, than it is, and ſo he falleth in without feare, to vſe Mr. Gataker ſimilitude, pag. 264. But Mr. Gataker beleveth, that he hath written the truth, (Preface to the Reader) and is confident that truth is to be knowne, eſpecially concerning matters of common practiſe, pag. 263. and giveth foure reaſons, by which he was mooved to defend1. luſorious Lottes, pag. 264. The first is, To draw men from Superſtition in reſtraining themſelves, when God doth not reſtraine them. This beggeth the queſtion, (as I hope) will appeare in the Reply.
                  
                     •
                  . A 2. motive is, Becauſe arguments againſt luſorious Lottes have made

many ſtagger in the neceſſary vſe of ſerious civill Lottes. It may be ſo ſome failing in their judgment: But it may be alſo, that many moe will be made to ſtagger by reading Mr. Gatakers exceptions againſt arguments for, and cautions, in thoſe ſerious Civill Lottes, Cap. 5. and by his Maxime, [The leſſe weighty the matter is, wherein a Lott is vſed, the lawfuller the Lott is, pag. 111.] A 3. motive is, To take away3▪
                much heart-burning; Nay, rather this juſtifying Luſorious Lottes will not onely cauſe more heart-burning; but incourage alſo gameſters to overcrow ſuch, as are ſcrupulous. For, if many well affected have beene conſtrained, in regard of ſcruple, in this kinde, to ſtraine themſelves to ſome inconveniences by refuſall of thoſe games, when by thoſe, whom they had dependance vpon,

vpon or familiarity withall, they have beene vrged occaſionally therevnto (which to prevent hereafter, is a 4. cauſe of his writing) How will thoſe ſupporters, and familiars inſult vpon the ſcrupulous▪ now they have ſo learned a Patrone of their gaming? Some have ſtrained themſelves, to ſome inconveniences for not pledging drunken Healths, being drinke offerings to Bacchus. To prevent which hereafter, should Mr. Gataker doe well, vnto aedification, to preach, and write in Iuſtification of theſe Healths? The ſumme of his cauſes (as he expreſſeth himſelfe in his preface to the Reader) is, To ſett at Liberty the intangled conſciences of Godly diſpoſed perſons. Indeed; If any conſcience, ſimply for playing with Lottes, should ſeeke his his ſatisfaction in private, then if Mr. Gataker quieted

him by his grounds (ſuppoſed true) it were not amiſſe. But is every doctrine, though true, to be inſiſted vpon both by preaching, and printing, and that affirming matter in queſtion, and of no neceſſary vſe? I ſay, Affirming, remembring the holy wiſedome of the Apoſtles, and Elders, who decreed touching offenſive things (yet ſome of them lawfull, if conveniently vſed) onely negatively, and deemeth it not neceſſaryAct. 15. 28. 29. to decree affirmatively things that were then, and might be in vſe for a time. Many (I feare too many) learned Divines approove Vſury in their Iudgment, thouh condemned by Law. Yet none, that I know, ever inſiſted vpon the Iuſtification thereof by preaching and printing. Againe; Was there ever any ſo troubled with playing with Lotts? I doubt it; But without doubt thouſandes will now more

boldly vſe luſorious Lotts without regard of the cautions, in theis licentious times. As Vſurers regard not the cautions which Divines ſett downe. For it is enough to them, that ſome godly Divines affirme Vſury to be lawfull. O that Mr. Gataker had conſidered what he writeth, pag. 107. before cited, and what he writeth, pag. 103. and 104. viz: Where inconveniences, that shall neceſſarily, or in good probability, appeare to accompany the thing queſtioned, or enſu
                  •
                vpon the doing thereof, shall be ſuch, and ſo great as the Conveniences, which ſtand on the other ſide, shall not be able to countervaile, there that action is worthily diſallowed as Inconvenient, and 
                  •
                Lott conſequently vnlawfull, wha
                  •
                he writeth in his ſpirituall Watch pag. 27. viz: The rifer any evill i
                  •

                  •
               
               
the more carefull should we be to shunne, and avoide ſuch a ſinne. No doubt he would have taken heede how by writing he make way to the ſinne of, or by, Luſorious Lotts. Many Divines and intelligent men, though of opinion that Luſorious mixed Lotts may be vſed lawfully, yet wish that Mr. Gataker had never published his booke. For a running horſe (ſay they) needeth no ſpurring. For my part I wish, that Mr. Gataker had beene affected in writing, as he profeſſeth himſelfe to be in the vſe of luſorious Lottes, pag. 266. Wel; Whatſoever he writeth dogmatically, he wisheth thee (good Reader) to imitate him in▪ his practiſe, to witt, That, albeit in judgment thou art rightly informed of the truth concerning the lawfulneſſe of theis games in themſelves; yet in godly diſcretion,

thou wouldſt rather abandō them, conſidering the too too common, and ordinary abuſe of them, and that many (it may be) among whom thou liveſt may remaine vnreſolved, and vnſatisfied, touching the lawfulnes of them, pag. 267. I deſire the ſame, and therewith a ſuſpending thy judgment vntill thou haſt well conſidered my Dialogue, Mr. Gatakers anſweres, and my Reply, together with mine anſwere to his poſitive groundes. Here I promiſe (with Mr. Gataker, pag. 128.) to raze what I have reared, if my Reply and aunſweres be prooved inſufficient, and ſo commend thee to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build further. Onely, conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give thee vnderſtanding inAct. 20. 32. 2. Tim▪ 2. 7. all things.

            To the Reader.
            THat I may doe Mr. Gataker no wrong I am to lett thee know that the 14. of March. 1622. Stil: Ang. Mr. Gataker denied naming me when he confuted mine arguments in Pulpit, yet confeſsing that he named me in Pulpit, with others, diverſely diſsenting from him in judgment touching Luſorious Lotts when he entred into the queſtion of playing with Lotts.
         
         
            
            An Anſwere to Reaſons inducing M. Gataker to allow luſorious Lottes, as not evill in themſelves, Lib. 6. § 4.
            
               THIS Tenent ſeemeth to me more fearefull▪ then beſeemeth a learned man, who, after the turning over a wō
               derfull n umber of bookes to compile his Hiſtoricall, and Theologicall Treatiſe of the Nature, and Vſe of Lotres, ſetteth downe his judgment. Allowing luſorious Lottes onely as not evill in themſelves, whereas he affirmeth them to be lawfull in themſelves, pag. 266. So that if theis games be vſed with

due obſervation of all his cautions, why is he fearefull to allow them as good in themſelves? How then may a ſcrupulous man, who remembrethEzek. 36 31. not onely his wicked wicked wayes, but his deedes alſo that are not good, build vpon ſuch quagmiry grounds? Againe; Allowing theis games onely as not evill in themſelves doth not manifeſt that Love of God, which (I doubt not) is in Mr. Gatakers heart. For whereas God is glorified by good workes,Math. 
                     
                        •
                     . 16. and theis games be too too common, and accompanied with many crying ſinnes, whereby God is every where, and dayly much diſhonoured, the Love of God would have conſtrained him, if doingIohn. 5. 21. truth, to haue brought theis games to the light, that thereby it might be made manifeſt, that they are wrought according to God. Lastly; By this Tenent he sheweth

not due Charity to his neighbour. For now it is enoug for Gameſters to pleade; A very learned man holdeth our Gaming to be not evill in it ſelfe. Therefore they will not ſeeke, further to know, whither it be good in it ſelfe, forgetting that it is writen▪
               Math. 3. 10. [The axe is putt to the roote of the trees, therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruite▪
                is hewen downe, and caſt into the fire.] Is not then hereby his neighbour's ſpirituall daunger occaſioned? But here (perhappes) it may be ſaid, The firſt Reaſon, prooving that a Lott may be matter of Recreation, doth give me a checke: It is a checke? Then I will try if I cannot avoide the Mate. The Argument, collected with all faithfulnes, (as the reſt, and his aunſweres be,) is this.
            
               M. G. 1. That which may be ordinarily vſed in other Civill affaires, be they

more or leſſe weighty, may alſo be vſed for matter of recreation, and delight: But a Lott may be ordinarily vſed in other Civill affaires. Therefore I ſee not what should banish it out of our diſportes, more than out of other (though ſerious yet) Civill affaires.
            
               I. B. 1. Is not this a fearefull concluſion like the Tenent? Why doth not Mr. Gataker conclude poſitively thus. Therefore a Lott may be vſed for matter of recreation, and delighte. He (forſooth) ſee's not. Can a blinde man goe ſtoutly on his way? But (bleſſed be God) Mr. Gataker ſeeth well, though not in this point. Bernardus non vidit omnia. For, if God had opened his eyes in this point, he might have ſeene plainely what should banish a Lott out of diſportes, more than out of other Civill affaires. To witt, Becauſe God alloweth a Lott to be vſed

in them, but not in theis; and It is praeſumption, of ſett purpoſe, to imploy God but as it may ſtand with his pleaſure. Hereof more hereafter. In meane while, in further aunſwer to this argument I deny the Propoſition thereof. For an Oath may be ordinarily vſed in other Civill matters, yet not for matter of Recreation: Whereof alſo more hereafter. Now I proceed to the 2. reaſon, which is ſett downe in twoo shapes; The former is this.
            
               M. G. 2. That which beſt ſorteth with the nature of a Lott, may a Lott moſt lawfully be vſed vnto: But the lighteſt matters beſt ſort with the nature of a Lott: Therefore about things of that nature may a Lott moſt lawfully be vſed. The Propoſition he prooveth thus. Great is the vncertainty of a Lott. Therefore not fitt to be vſed in any

weighty affaire.
            
               I. B. 2▪
                A Lott is ſometimes taken for the inſtrument of purpoſe diſpoſed vnto caſualty, as [The Lott is cast

               into the lappe:] and ſometime for the event, as, [Give a perfect Lott] Which, howſoever it be caſuall in relation to the former, yet, falleth out certainely this, or that, by God's whole diſpoſing the former, Prov. 16. 33. I therefore deny both the Propoſition, and Aſſumption perſwaded that Mr. Gataker would never have ſett downe this ſuppoſed reaſon, if a Lott, in the former acception, had not drawne his religious eye from God as the onely diſpoſer thereof to be a Lott in the latter acception. So that I mervaile much, that he findeth a Lott to be not fitt to be vſed in any weighty affaire. For why? Dividing the Land of promiſe, Numb. 26. 55. by Lott.

               Diſcovering Achan. Iohſ. 14. Chuſing of a king. 1. Sam. 10. 20. 81. and of an Apoſtle Acts: 1. 26. were they not weighty affaires? Nay rather the premiſes conſidered, a Lott may more lawfully be vſed about weighty affaires. But indeed▪ whether the ſubiect matter be more or leſſe weighty, a Lott may be vſed about it, provided it be with Gods allowance. For want whereof both Divinatory, and Luſorious Lotts be equally vnlawfull. The other shape of his reaſon, more particularly (as he ſaith) for the preſent buiſineſſe is this.
            
               M. G. A matter of mere indifferency, that is, ſuch as a man may lawfully doe, or not doe, and it is not materiall whether he doe, or omitt, ſuch may a man lawfully putt to the hazard of the vncertaine motion of the Creature, whether he shall doe it, or not doe it▪ But the vſing of

a Lott in game is but the putting of a matter of mere indifferency to the hazard of an vncertaine event. Therefore the putting of ſuch matters to the hazard of a Lott, is not evill ſimply in it ſelfe.
            
               I. B▪
                What a trembling argument is this? In the Propoſition he ſpeaketh of a Lott in the former acception. In the Aſſumption, of a Lott in the latter acception. Indeed a man may be bolder with the Creature, ſo it be without relation to God, than with the Creatour himſelfe. In the Propoſition he affirmeth lawfullnes but concludeth onely, as not evill ſimply in themſelves. Indeed, the concluſion is to follow the worſe part: But in this Argument the Aſſumption is particular, and the Concluſion is generall▪ What? Is Mr. Gataker affraid to put (The vſing of a Lott in game) into the concluſion? is not

the Minor to be the Subiect, and the Maior to be the Praedicate of the Concluſion? I will not quaeſtion the Figure of this praetended argument if Sub: prae: prima: will ſerve the turne; and though I finde it in no Moode, yet will I anſwer the two fore-pieces thereof. The former is not true, except Mr. Gataker vnderſtand a matter of mere indifferency controverted. For though ſuch a matter may be the ſubiect matter of a Controverſy, yet a matter controverted is the onely ſubiect matter of a Lott, otherwiſe it is no Lott, as Mr. Gataker truely writeth even in this caſe, pag. 167. If Mr. Gataker ſo vnderſtand, then there is ſome neceſſity of ending the controyerſy putt to the determination of a Lott, and conſequently it is not then merely in the wiil of a man whether he shall doe it, or no doe it. In the other piece I obſerve,

that Mr. Gataker ſpeaking of a Lot in the ſecond acception, ſuppoſeth it to be vncertaine. Which is begging the queſtion, for the reaſon given in mine aunſwere to his former shaped argument. Neither it is true that if in game, a controverſy (truly ſo termed) be decided by a Lot, a matter then of mere indifferency is put to hazard. But more hereof in my 3. reply. In meane while, conſider whether this 2. shape be more particularly for the preſent buſineſſe, ſo as to conclude the queſtion, than the former; and Note, that in both theis shapes, onely Lightnes, and indifferency of matters putt to Lottery are preſſed as cauſes moſt iuſtifying a Lot, yea ſo, as that in the confirmation of his former shaped arguments propoſition, he poſitively affirmeth that we shall finde a Lott not fitt to be vſed in a weighty affaire▪
               
If ſo, then Weightneſſe, and Neceſſity of matters controverted make Lottery leſſe lawfull, if not altogether vnlawfull. But thereof alſo more in that reply. I therefore proceed to his 3. reaſon pag. 131. Which is this.
            
               M. G. 3. If the vſe of Lotts in game be of it ſelfe evill, then muſt it needs be a ſinne either againſt Piety in the firſt table, or ag: Charity in the 2. But the vſe of Lottes in game, is not of it ſelfe, a ſinne againſt either Piety, or Charity. Therefore it muſt be iuſtified as agreeable to Gods Word. The Aſſumption is prooved thus▪ No man avoweth the vſe of a Lot in game, (as it is a Lott) to be againſt Charity: and A Luſorious Lot is not the prophaning of any thing hallowed, by any divine inſtitution from the Word, to an holy Vſe. Therefore not againſt Piety. Indeed, if Lottes be holy, they may

in no caſe be made matter of ſport.
            
               I. B. 3. Here I obſerve one of the faults which I found in the latter shape of the 2. reaſon to witt▪
                The concluſion conteineth more than the premiſſes. For the Concluſion ſaith A Lot in game is agreeable to Gods Word, and then it muſt be [Good of it ſelfe,] which is more, than [Not evill of it ſelfe.] For that is good of it ſelfe, for doing whereof there is either praecept, or permiſſion in Gods word, pag. 137. But to the Aſſumption, an d proofe thereof I anſwere, That the vſe of a Lott in game is, (of it ſelfe), a ſinne againſt Piety. For it profaneth a Lot hallowed by divine inſtitution from the Word, as shall be manifeſted hereafter. Yet here I thinke fitt breifely to shew 2. things. One is,
               1. That an Oath is hallowed to mak
                  •
                an holy vſe of the teſtifying preſence

of God, So a Lot is hallowed to make an holy vſe of the determining preſence of God. If Mr. Gataker deny a Lott to be holy, except it have a more remote holy vſe, I ſay He may as well deny an Oath to be holy for that cauſe. More of2. this point in my 2. reply. The other is, That vſe of a Lott is againſt Piety, which is (I ſay not, [Not forbidden] but) [Not warranted] by the Word. For it is without faith, therefore aRom. 14 23. ſinne, yea Impiety. So diſputeth Mr. Gataker againſt a Divinatory Lott, pag. 313. and ſo doe I againſt a Luſorions Lot. If then a lawfull Lott be holy, it is (ſaith Mr. Gataker) in no caſe to be made matter of ſport. Nay, I may make yet more advantage. For I may ſay; That maintaining the vſe thereof in gaming, as it is a Lott, by practiſe, much more by writing, is againſt Charity, as well as againſt Piety. For

ſo [a weake brother is offended, and con

                  equently Christ ſinned againſt] that brother being occaſioned, by errour of iudgment, to ſtumble. I have this reaſoning from Mr. Gataker himſelfe, pag. 255. Now then with ſome comfort I proceed to the 4. argument, as Mr. Gataker calleth it, pag. 134.
            
            
               M. G. 4. By vertue of Chriſtian liberty, every Chriſtian man hath a free vſe of all Gods good creatures, to imploy them vnto ſuch purpoſes, as by any naturall power, they are inabled vnto: But in luſorious Lottes the Creature is vſed to no other ende or vſe, but what it hath a naturall power vnto, and ſuch as by the mutuall conſent, and agreement of thoſe that vſe it, it may be enabled to effect. Therefore it's no more to be exiled from a Chriſtian man's recratiō, than any other creature whatſoever, that hath any

power to delight.
            
               I. B. 4. So generall & eager is the purſuite after Liberty in this licentious age, that a godly, and charitable Chriſtian, (much more being a miniſter), ought to take great heede, that he occaſion not any1. Pet. 2. 16. much leſſe too too many, to make Liberty a cloake of Naughtineſſe▪
                But Mr. Gataker ſpeaketh of Chriſtian liberty, not of Licentiouſneſſe▪
                Then let vs conſider what he ſaith▪ For both the premiſſes of this argument are flatly to be denied▪ For ſundry good Creatures have a naturall power to impoiſon; But Chriſtian Liberty giveth vs not free vſe thereof to impoiſon a
                  •
                pleaſure. Neither is it true that any creature hath a naturall power to be a Lott, no more than a ſtone hath a naturall power to be carried vpward. For as a ſtone is carried vpward by a power; that is without

it: ſo all creatures are mooved, & applied to be Lotts by a power without them. God keepe me from teaching that Chriſtian Liberty warranteth the vnlawfull vſe of any Creature, what naturall power ſoever it hath to that vſe. If any creature have any power to be a Lot, yet that power is not to be vſed vnto Lottery, but in caſes (whereof gameing is none) wherein God alloweth ſuch vſe thereof. To the inforcing of the concluſion by a ſuppoſed confirmation of the Aſſumption, I ſay, It is a begging of the queſtion. For though a dog having a naturall power to hunt, be not exiled from recreatiō yet ought a Lot-creature to be, for reaſons given, and to be given, or rather defended hereafter. Now then to a 5. argument A conceſsis, (as Mr. Gataker tearmeth it,) pag. 135.
            
            
               
               M. G. S. Any thing in different is lawfull matter of recreation: But Lottery is a thing indiffertnt; Lottery therefore may be made lawfull matter of diſport. The Propoſition is confirmed by the wordes of M. Fennor. Chriſtian (ſaith he) recreation is the exerciſe of ſome thing indifferent for the neceſſary refreſhing of body, or minde. The Aſſumption is alſo proved by Mr. Fennor. Indifferent in nature is that, which is left free, ſo as we are not ſimply commaunded, or forbidden to vſe it: But ſuch is Lottery (ſaith Mr. Gataker) Not ſimply commaunded. For Prov. 18. 18. is rather a permiſsion than a praecept, or, Not ſo much a Commaundement as an adviſe commending that as a prudent courſe; Nor any where forbidden as evill in it ſelfe.
            
               I. B. S. 
               Mr. Fennor's booke, from whence theis allegations be drawne, and from whence I learned that

Lottes may not be vſed in ſport, doth proove that luſorious Lottes are forbidden, and therefore not indifferent. What helpe then hath Mr. Gataker from Mr. Fenners grauntes? and his owne proofes helpe him as little. For it is graunted, that if Lottery be either commaunded, or forbidden, it is not indifferent, to paſſe by the former, onely obſerving that Mr, Gataker doth not abſolutely deny it to be commaunded, Prov. 18. 18. I come to the other. I might here referre the Reader to my Dialogue, and to my Reply, by which it will appeare evidently, that a Luſorious Lott is forbidden, and therefore not indifferent. But to ſpeake a little more (generally) of things not indifferent, becauſe forbidden, I ſay, That is forbidden as well which is forbidd
                  •
               
               ̄ by iuſt cōſequence, as that

which is expreſly forbidden: As that is permitted as well which is permitted by iuſt conſequence as that which is expreſſely permitted. Mr. Gataker affirmeth, the latter, pa▪ 137. and will not (I dare fay) deny the former. Againe, The Word of God is ſo perfect, that whatſoever it neither commaundeth, nor permitteth expreſſely, or by iuſt conſequence, that is verily forbidden. For all things eſpecially ſuch as have relation to God, ought to have ſome warrant from the word. If Mr. Gataker putt me to proove this, I dare vndertake to proove it demonſtratively. But I preſume he will not. For, in the laſt mentioned page, he deſcribeth that to be indifferent, which is (at leaſt) permitted by the Word. If a thing be not ſo much as permitted, it cannot be lawfull, and therefore not in̄different. Here I wish he would

remember what he writeth pag. 95. Speaking of this word [Indifferent,]

                Gods worde, but hath ſufficient warrant from it, as he pretendeth in his introduction, pag. 136. It is this.
            
               M. G. 6. Where the Wiſdome of God, hath not determined the ſubiect matter, the manner, and other Circumſtances of a thing lawfull in it ſelfe, there all ſuch are lawfull, a
                  •
                the Word doth not forbid, and a
                  •
                no Circumſtance that a man shall

make choice of, shall be againſt the generall rules of the word concerning the ſame: But a Lott is a thing lawfull in it ſelfe, and the ſubiectmatter, manner, & other Circumſtances thereof are not determined by Gods Word, nor againſt the generall rules. Therefore a Lott in game is not prohibited, nor is againſt the generall rules of Gods Word otherwiſe. The Propoſition he confirmeth. First, touching a thing lawfull in it ſelfe, by shewing1. that act to be lawfull in it ſelfe, which in Gods word, is either commaunded, or permitted expreſſely, or by iuſt conſequence. Secondly, touching the manner &c. by prooving2. the reſt of the Propoſition; which he indeavoureth to performe. (1.) By the Authority of Calvin. (2.) By Luke: 9. 50. (3.) By a gloſſe (4.)

But for better ſatisfaction, I will anſwere more particularly, not doubting, but that the Proverbe may (now) proove true, viz: In many wordes there cannot want iniquity.
               Pro. 10. 19. 
               First, I obſerve fearefull shifting,1. and then vnſound arguing. The former thus appeareth, He ſuppoſeth

the thing muſt be lawfull in it ſelfe, and diſputeth onely about the ſubiect-matter, &c. Againe, In the introduction he ſaith. Th'vſe of Lottes in game is not againſt God's Word, but hath ſufficient warrant from it, which may imply this poſition. [That is againſt the Word, which hath not ſufficient warrant from it.] But in the Propoſition of the maine argument his ground is; [Such things are lawfull, which the Word doth not forbid.] Fower of his confirmations, and his Aſſumption are to that effect, or rather defect, and his concluſion is anſwereable: Is not this a fearefull shifting courſe of reaſoning? Now let vs conſider his vnſound arguing. Touching the Propoſition of his maine argument, I mervaile why Mr. Gataker avouching ſuch ſubiect-matter &c. to be lawfull as are not forbidden, limiteth this

aſſertion with theis wordes (Of a thing lawfull in it ſelfe) As if ſuch a thing may warrant our retchleſneſſe in, and about the ſubiect-matter &c. As if God doth not, according to the olde ſaying, [Loue Adverbes] An Oath is a thing lawfull in it ſelfe; Are not we therefore to make conſcience, that the ſubiect-matter, &c. be agreable to the Word of God? But I mervaile much more at this gronnd. [Such things are lawfull, as the Word doth not forbid.] I ſet it downe thus, becauſe the confirmations tend to make this good, and ſo conclude. All things not prohibited are permitted, and therefore the ſubiect-matter, &c. of a thing lawfull in it ſelfe. I mervaile (I ſay) the more becauſe Mr. Gataker confirmeth a thing or act it ſelfe to be lawfull in it ſelfe, if it be in the Word, either commaunded, or permitted expreſſely,

or by iuſt conſequence. Which I acknowledge to be ſo cleare a truth, that (me think's) Mr. Gataker cannot, but, in proportion of reaſon, if he beleive the Word to be perfect vnto everyPſal. 19.

               1. teſtimony in English is this. [When the Scripture delivereth generall rules of a lawfull vſe, the vſe is to be limited according to them.] From hence Mr. Gataker concludeth that a man hath a ſufficient warrant for any circumſtance he shall make choiſe of, that is not againſt thoſe rules. Mr. Calvin ſpeaketh of an Vſe, and of an Vſe doe we diſpute, Mr. Gataker concludeth a Circumſtance: Mr. Calvin ſaith, According, Mr. Gataker
               
concludeth, Not againſt. Is

                  . this ſound arguing? Is the 2. confirmation from Luke: 9. 50. much better? The wordes ſet downe by Mr. Gataker be theis. [He that is not against me, is with me.] This place (forſooth) is a rule holding in the ſubiect-matter, &c. neither determined, nor forbidden. As theis wordes, [He that is not with me, is against me, Math. 12. 30.] is a rule in the ſubiect-matter, &c. determined. Both a like in conceipt. And why may not M. Gatakers? conceipt be the ſame touching thinges, or actions? But let vs ſee, whether the conceipt be not a be-miſted Phantaſy. In the former place Chriſt his wordes are occaſioned 
                  •
               y his Diſciples their forbidding one who caſt out Divels in Chriſt his name. Forbid him not (ſaid Chriſt) for, He, that is not againſt me, is with me. In the latter place

Chriſt ſpake thoſe wordes vpon occaſion of the Phariſes their oppoſition. So that conſider the two ſentences with their occaſions togither, this, indeed, is the ſumme. All men are either with, or againſt Chriſt. For there be no Neutralles. So that thoſe two ſentences are like theis. He that is not a goate, is a sheepe, and He that is not a sheepe is a goate. But Mr. Gataker's argument is this. All men who are not againſt Chriſt, are with him. Therefore Circumſtances not determined, nor forbidden, are lawfull. Is this ſound arguing? The third confirmation is from a Gloſſe.3. Here I remember an olde ſaying [A curſed gloſſe corrupt's the Text.] Now lett vs ſee whether Mr. Gataker have any bleſſing by this gloſſe, the wordes whereof in English, be theis. [All things are permitted by Law, which are not found prohibited.] Note,

that it ſpeake's of things. Therefore it make's as well for actions, as for circumſtances▪ Is this Divinity? But what Law? If the Civill Law, what is that to the point? Except Mr. Gataker can proove, the Civill Law to be a perfect rule to vs; and whatſoever it permitteth is allowed of God. Howſoever, (I ſay) this courſe of fetching proofes from any other Law, than God's Law, is fitter for a Papiſt, who holdeth Vnwritten verities (ſo called) to be a ſupplement to the Scriptures, thereby to authorize traditions of men, than for one, that fearethDeut. 10 12. God to walke in his wayes. Is then this gloſſing ſound arguing? Hath4. the fourth confirmation more validity in it than the reſt? The former 3. proofes ſpeake not directly of Circmmſtances according to the propoſition, (ſo doth Mr. Gataker diſpute Adidem) here he doth▪

               Good Lord!
               
What fearefull shifting from the Word is here? But why doth he ioyne the doing it ſelfe of an Act. with the manner thereof? I'le tell you, even to make a way to his Aſſumption. For, if he ſticke cloſe to that which he teacheth in imediate wordes, to witt, that an act it ſelſe is lawfull in it ſelfe, if, in the Word, it be, either commaunded; or permitted expreſſely, or by iuſt conſequence, he foreſeeth, that it will be anſwered to the fore-part of his aſſumption, that every Lott is not lawfull in it ſelfe. Therefore he would trouble the Reader's head with a ſuppoſed direction therein of naturall reaſon, and that ſufficient, (I ſay) Suppoſed; For he sheweth no direction therein of naturall reaſon either ſufficient, or inſufficient. But let vs with feare, and trembling, conſider Mr. Gataker his moſt ſtraunge poſition

to witt, [Neither the doing of any act, nor the manner of doing needeth warrant from the Word, if naturall Reaſon of it ſelfe, affoard ſufficient direction.] Let vs conſider it (I ſay) together with his reaſon. For (ſaith he) the Word is given vs in morall matters, to ſupply the defect of naturall reaſon cauſed by our firſt parents their fall. Is it our beſt way then to ſeeke ſufficient direction, in morall matters, from naturall reaſon, before wc conſult with God in his Word? For the ſaid direction is the 2. time vrged thus. I ſay where natnrall reaſon doth not, of it ſelfe, afford ſufficient direction, and neede not a man know, that he hath warrant ſrom God's Word if, in his perſwaſion, he have ſufficient direction from naturall Reaſon? Doth the Max

intimate. That whatſoever is done by ſufficient direction from naturall reaſon, is of Faith? Became naturall reaſon onely defective, and not corrupted alſo by ourRom. 8. 7. firſt Parents their fall? O God have mercy vpon vs! For I ſee that the Wiſedome of the Flesh is Enmity againſt thee; For it is not fubiect to thy Law, neither, indeed, can be. But why doe I vexe my ſoule with this fearefull doctrine, ſeeing Mr. Gatakers heart fainteth in the proſecution thereof? For, at laſt, he cometh to ſay. Neither doth the Word abridge vs of the helpe, and vſe of naturall reaſon for direction in ſuch actions. Here is ſome more authority (to witt, Of not abridging vs of the helpe, &c.) given to the Word. For it doth imply, that the Word might abridge vs, &c. Therefore ou
                  •
                moſt warrantable way is to be well

informed, when, and how farre, the Word doth give vs leave to vſe the direction of naturall reaſon in morall matters. If this be ſo, then the former ſtrange doctrine is contradicted, and I neede not make any anſwer to the ſcriptures quoted in the margent. So then I proceed to the Aſſumption of the maine argument. In the former part whereof, it is to be denied (as was ſaide before) that every Lot is a thing lawfull in it ſelfe. For as a Divinatory, by him, cap. 11. ſo a Luſorious Lott by me, and others, is denied to be a thing lawfull in it ſelfe. More clearily to anſwer the other part. It is to be obſerved, that, in this large, argument it cannot be gathered w
                  •
               ath M. G. meaneth by Subiect-matter. So the minde of the Reader may be troubled with wordes, which ought not to be. ButActs. 15 24. by that which he writeth, pag. 230. I

vnderſtand he meaneth the Matter whereabout the Lottery is imployed. If ſo, I affirme that the fubiect matter of a Lott is determined by God, namely, A Controverſy to be ended thereby; and therefore I alſo affirme luſorius buiſineſſe (to vſe Mr. Gataker owne word pag. 130.) to be a ſubiect-matter of a Lott, no leſſe againſt the generall rules of the Word, than was the finding out of Ionas, in Mr. Gatakers iudgment, pag. 278. If then a Luſorious Lott be not a thing lawfull in it ſelfe, & If Luſorious buiſineſſe be a ſubiect-matter of a Lott, that is againſt the generall rules, then how can the manner, and other circumſtances, though neither determined, nor forbidden, be ſufficient warrant for the vſe of a Luſorious Lott? Now then, Let vs try the force of the Aſſumption's confirmation. It

is true that Recreation in generall, indefinitely vnderſtood, is warranted by God's Word. But I beleive Mr. Gataker will not affirme all recreations taken vp by men, to be ſo warranted. Yes (ſaith Mr. Gataker) we may recreate our ſelves with any thing, that is not againſt the generales rules, becauſe, touching things, wherewith we may recreate, there is nothing determined.
            Of this evaſion [Not againſt] I neede not ſpeake at this inſtant. But touching things not determined, ſo much inculcated, I aske whether things muſt be determined particularly, or by name; or elſe, if not ſo forbidden, they are lawfull. If ſo, why doth Mr. Gataker (ſpeaking of divers particulars,) as of a key, and a booke, of a paire of sheares, and a 
                  •
               ive, and ſuch like

ſo earneſtly aske, Are they any where found revealed in the Word of God? Where he is of another minde, than here, arguing thus. Not found there commaunded, or permitted; therefore vnlawfull. If it be ſaid, Not ſo found there, to finde out a theife. I then ſay; Neither are Lottes ſo found there for Recreation. But if by Not determined be meant, Thinges wherewith we recreare are not determined in the Word either expreſſly, or by iuſt conſequence, then, whoſoever ſaith ſo, if he be wiſe, will adde [So farre as I doe remember, and know.] For who can remember all the ſentences of holy Scriptures, and know all iuſt conſequences, that may be made from them? If he thus adde then his Negation is of no validity, but he himſelfe is too bolde in denying, vpon preſumption, that another remembreth, and knoweth no

more than he. At laſt let vs religiouſly conſider the generall rules ſo often ſpoken of, and we shall finde, that Mr. Gataker should have done well not to have pleaſed Libertines by pleading Not against, but to have given the Word due honour by ſaying with Mr. Calvin. [The vſe of things is to be limited according to the generall rules.] For theis rules require Decency, Expediency, and Piety, and therefore they are not obeyed by the vſe of things not vndecent, not inexpedient, and not impious. For it is to be noted that in 1. Cor. 6. 12. and 12. 23. Paul ſaith not, all things are lawfull, but ſome things are inexpedient, but in both places thus. [All things are lawfull, but all are not expedient.] Let vs conſider theis rules yet ſomewhat more nearely to the point. Touching the first. The wordes of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 14. 40. be theis.

               [Let all things be done honestly, and by order] In which is no intimation, that all things are in themſelves lawfull to be done, which are done honestly, & by order, but a charge that all things, be they in themſelves never ſo lawfull, be done honeſtly, & by order. Thoſe drinke offerings to Bacchus, commonly called Healthes (per Antiphraſin,) are ſolemnized ſometimes with ſtanding, ſometimes with kneeling, alwayes with putting of hatts, and ſome ſpeech more or leſſe, are they acceptable to God, becauſe they are thus orderly carried? If not, Then be Lotts, and the vſers of them in gaming never ſo orderly diſpoſed, yet are they not therefore iuſtified.2. Touching the ſecond rule. It is true, That all things muſt be expedient, that is, edify, 1. Cor. 10. 23. Therefore they ſinne who ſtumble, or offend a brother, that is, occaſion

him to fall or be made weake, Rom. 14. 13. 21. But Lu

               orious Lotts occaſion thouſands to fall into ſinne, & to be weake in goodneſſe. Therefore they doe not edifie, and therefore are not expedient. Concerning the 3. rule. Let all things to be
               3▪
                
               done to Gods glory, 1. Cor. 10. 31. Is this to Gods glory, to vſe his name in any other caſe than wherein God is well pleaſed his name should be vſed, & thē to take that name in vaine? Is tempting of God any glory to God? But playing with a Lottis to vſe God's name in an other caſe, than wherein God is well pleaſed his Name should be vſed, and then alſo to take that Name in vaine, & it is a greivous tempting of God as shall be prooved. Therefore playing with a Lots is not to God's glory, & by conſequence not agreable to Religion, and Piety. Though it be ſufficiently prooved that Luſorious

Lotts are directly aga in

                of the generall Rules, and not warranted by the third, ſo that Mr. Gataker hath not bete red his cauſe by appealing to them, yet it is to be obſerved, that all the rules require, Things, and Actions to be according to them, But Mr. Gataker by onely ſpeaking of them, would iuſtify circumſtances, and meanes of playing with Lotts if (forſooth) they be not againſt them. Thus having evidently shewed Reaſons inducing (not drawing) Mr. Gataker to allow Luſorious Lotts to be both fearefull, as theis evaſive ſpeeches. [Not evill in themſelves.] [Not prohibited.] [Not determined.] &, [Not againſt the generall rules,] doe import, & otherwiſe vnſound, I wil now (with God's helpe I hope) reply vpon M.

               Aunſw. pa. 149. The Aſſumption is not true, if it be underſtood vniverſally. The proofe annexed I deny; Neither doe the places produced proove it. The former of them, concerning ordinary Lotts, or Lotts in generall, was anſwered ſufficiently before. The latter is an example of an extraordinary Lott, wherein was (indeed) an immediate, and ſpeciall Providence. But extraordinary examples make no generall rules Neither is it a good courſe of arguing to reaſon from the ſpeciall, or a ſingular, to the generall, and vniverſall: Much leſſe from one extraordinary act or event, to all ordinary courſes of the ſame kinde. Herein is the difference betweene the one, and the other

That the one could not but fall certainly, were it never ſo often caſt, whereas the other, caſt often in the ſame caſe, would not certainely fall out ſtill the ſame.
            The aſſumption vnderſtood vniverſallyReply 1. is true, and the places quoted make good the proofe thereof, as shall be made manifeſt. Firſt therefore let vs conſider the1. ſuppoſed diſtinction betweene ordinary, and extraordinary Lottes Mr. Gataker ſpeaketh of a diſtinction, but sheweth not wherein, (touching the Lottes themſelves,) it doth conſiſt. Indeed, touching themſelves, (as they be Lottes,) there is no difference; For in an ordinary, as well as in an extraordinary Lott, the things are by man, of purpoſe intentionally diſpoſed vnto a variable event, & they are wholy diſpoſed by God vnto this, or vnto that event,

which the vſer of a Lott expecteth. If ſo, then it followeth, That the vſe of all Lottes, (as they be Lottes) whether ordinary, or extraordinary, directly, or of it ſelfe, & in ſpeciall ma
                  •
               ner, tendeth to the advauncing of the Name of God. How? The vſe of Lottes attributeth to Gods ſpeciall Providence In the whole, and immediate diſpoſing of the Lott, & In expecting the event- Doth this ſcarce carry good ſence? Is there then no difference betweene an ordinary, and extraordinary Lott? The onely difference is the ſubiect-matter whereabout the Lott is imployed. The ſubiect-matter of an ordinary Lott, is, by God's allowance, A Controverſy to be ended: The ſubiect-matter of an extraordinary Lott is any other matter, whereabout a Lott is imployed by God's ſpeciall direction; otherwiſe it is

vnlawfull, as be luſorious, and Divinatory Lotts. In regard of which difference onely, Mr. Gatakers Logique holdeth good, as thus. From the vſe of a Lott about an other matter than ending a Controverſy and that by God's ſpeciall direction, it followeth not, that it is lawfull to vſe a Lott about any other matter, than ending a Controverſy, as gaming, without God's ſpeciall direction. But Mr. Gataker maketh an other difference to witt, An immediate, and ſpeciall Providence in an extraordinary Lott, which is not in an ordinary Lott. He doth ſo; and therefore in his Logique, he cunningly ioyneth a ſuppoſed extraordinary Event to a ſuppoſed extraordinary Act, & declineth the proofe of an extraordinary act, which rather he should have done, becauſe mine argument ſtandeth vpon the Vſe

of Lottes. Neither doth he foundly proove an immediate, and ſpeciall Providence, or extraordinary event, to be in an extraordinary, and not in an ordinary Lott. For, as it is a tempting of God to caſt an extraordinary Lott the firſt time without God's ſpeciall direction, pag. 313. ſo it is a tempting, yea, a greater tempting of God, when he hath given his iudgmentalready by the event of the Lott, to caſt the Lott againe without his ſpeciall direction. How then can Mr. Gataker ſo confidently affirme, that an extraordinary Lot could not but fall certainly, were it never ſo oft caſt? Indeed, The certaine event of an extraordinary Lot may, in faith, be expected, becauſe of Gods ſpeciall direction. And why not ſo in an ordinary Lott? Seeing God adviſeth vs, pag. 
                     •
                  35. to vſe Lottes for the ending

of controverſies. Prov. 18. 18. and aſſureth vs that the whole diſpoſing of them is of him, Prov. 16. 33. But Mr. Gataker hath anſwered this place before. Let vs then conſider what he hath anſwered. Before he ſaith, pag. 144. Good Authours expound this place of ſingular, extraordinary, and miraculous Lottes onely. But (ſaith he) the wordes ſeeme to be more generall, and are, word for word, thus in the Originall, [The Lord is cast into the Lappe, but every iudgment, or diſpoſing of it, is of God.] Doth not confuting them, who holde onely extraordinary Lottes to be meant in this place, and tranſlating the Text [Every iudgment] and expounding it, [Or diſpoſing of it,] shew plainely that this place prooveth mine Aſſumption to be vniverſally true? So that I much mervaile that he denieth

this place to prooue mine Aſſumption, becauſe it concerneth Lottes in generall. For if it doe ſo, then it prooveth that ordinary, as well as extraordinary Lottes tend to the advauncing of the Name of God. Againe pag. 145. Mr. Gataker taking the wordes, as they are vſually read in the Genevatranſlation, and the King's edition, to witt, [The Lott is cast into the lappe, but the whole diſpoſition, or diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord,] graunteth that the whole event is of God. A graunt though true, yet turning the reader aſide from ſeeing the whole truth. For the Text is, [The whole diſpoſing of the Lott caſt into the lappe.] If then the Lot caſt into the lap, that is, of purpoſ
                     •
                  
                diſpoſed by man vnto a variable event, be wholy diſpoſed by God, ſo, as the event be that, which pleaſeth him, then God doth not mediately diſpoſe the Lot to this, or that

event, if not mediately, then immemediately, becauſe the whole diſpoſing is of him. Doth not then this place make good mine Aſſumption? But for all this Mr. Gataker will not have it ſo; For as he tranſlateth this place, he ſaith It importeth thus much, [That there is a Providence in all things, even the leaſt, and moſt caſuall] and this he would confirme by theis my wordes, viz: [The diſpoſingꝭ of the chaunce is ſecret, that it might be chaunce indeed, & wholy of God, who directed all things.] Doe theis wordes iuſtifie Mr. Gatakers interpretation of this place? Yes; For they ſay plainely, God directed all things, and, they ſay withall; The diſpoſing of the chaunce (that is of the things purpoſedly diſpoſed by a man vnto a variable event) vnto a certaine event, is ſecret, that it may be chaunce indeed, that

is, an event not by the will of man, but wholy of God. So that my wordes imply this argument. God directeth all things, Therefore much more, in our diſcerning, a Lot, the whole diſpoſing whereof is of him. This is farre from ſaying that this place importeth onely, That there is a Providence in all things. Neither doth Mr. Gatakers tranſlation inferre this imported interpretation. For this diſcretion. [But] doth ſo oppoſe every iudgment, or diſpoſing of it (as he expoundeth Iudgment) to a Lot caſt into the lappe, as that Every diſpoſing, is all one with The whole diſpoſing. This place ſo troubleth Mr. Gataker that from it he would have no more gathered, than that the whole event (as of all things, ſo) of a Lot, is of the Lord. Yet ſo, as working by meanes in the moſt of them, and not implying and immediate

Providence vniverſally in them. I neede not examine the meanes, or immediate Providence of all the inſtances quoted in the margent For here it is impliedly graunted (for he faith not All, but the most of them) that in ſome things God worketh not by meanes, and that there is an immediate Providence Particularly, for he denieth ſuch a Providence onely, as being univerſally. Howſoever it be in other things, I thinke it is manifeſt to all, that will ſee, that God, without meanes, and therefore immediately, doth wholy diſpoſe the Lot caſt into the lappe vnto this, or that event, what pleaſeth him, whereas man diſpoſeth the things onely vnto a variable event. As at cardes, man shuffleth them of purpoſe to diſpoſe them vnto a variable event: But, by the immediate Providence of God, they are

ſo shuffled, as that this, or that event followeth. Therefore (with Mr. Gataker favour) any reaſonable man may iudge it not ſenſeleſſe to ſay (which he doubteth of pa. 147.) that in childrens playes, at Even, and Odde, or at Heades, & Points, there is an immediate Providence, In inclining the will of the childe, and guiding his coniecture. Thus we ſee this place doth confirme mine aſſumption, and the proofe annexed, Mr. Gatakers interpretation notwithſtanding. But he giveth 2. reaſons againſt an immediate providence in ordinary Lottes, which1. are alſo to be conſidered. The former is this. That which agreeth to a thing, as it is ſuch, agreeth neceſſarily to ȧll things, that are ſuch. Therefore if there be an immediate Providence in a Lot, as it is caſuall, then there is an immediate providence in all thinges, that are

caſuall: But the latter is not true; ergo not the former, pag. 143. Why not the latter? if the is Poſitions be true. That which ſeemes Chaunce to us, is a certaine Word of God (ſaith Bernard, But Mr. Gatak. tranſlatethSermo quidam it, Is as a word of God) acquainting vs with his Will, pag. 17. and In caſuall events there is nothing guiding them, but God's Providence, pag. 22. But ſuppoſe that there is not an immediate Providence in all things, that be caſuall, what is that to the purpoſe? For all things caſuall are not ſuch, with a Lott, wherein things are of purpoſe diſpoſed by man vnto an vncertaine event, which things, ſo diſpoſed by man, are wholy diſpoſed by God vnto a certaine event, this or that; ſo it is not in all other things, that be caſuall. Therefore all other caſuall things, and Lotts are not ſuch▪
                Neither is it ſaid an

immediate Providence is in a Lot, as it is caſuall, but as the Lot being made caſuall is wholy diſpoſed by God to this, or that event. So that from Mr▪ Gatakers axiome this argument may be framed. An immediate Providence, in an extraordinary Lot, is acknowledged by Mr. Gataker as it is a Lot (ſay I) wholy diſpoſed by God; Therefore an immediate Providence is in an ordinary Lot (as it is a Lot) wholy diſpoſed by God. For there is no difference betweene theis ſorts of Lotts, (as they be Lotts) and ſo diſpoſed. For Mr. Gataker hath shewed that Prov. 16. 33. ſpeaketh as well of one ſort of Lotts, as of another. The other argument is this▪ which is the kill-kow. If in every Lott there be neceſſarily an immediate worke, and Providence of God, then is it in the naturall of man to make God worke immediately

at his pleaſure: But to ſay, that it is in man's power naturally to ſett God on working, immediately, at his pleaſure, is abſurd. There is not therefore an immediate worke, and Providence of God neceſſarily in every Lott. Mr. Gataker like an Oratour, ſeemeth deſirous to draw his adverſary into hatred by thei wordes [Neceſſarily, Naturall power, Sett God on working, At pleaſure, To ſay, and Abſurd] Verba dum ſint, ſurdo canit. But hoping better, I aunſwering his Logique, deny the Aſſumption. For it is as much in man's naturall power to ſet God on worke immediately, in an ordinary, as in an extraordinary Lot. For both God, and man doe reſpectively as much in the one Lott, as in the other. But an extraordinary Lot is by the ſpeciall direction of God: True; So is an ordinary Lott by God's

ſpeciall adviſe to ende a controverſy. If then every Lot be a ſetting of our glorious God on worke, there ought to be prayer, if not by wordes; yet in heart in the vſe as well of ordinary, as extraordinary Lotts. If ſo, then Lotts are not to be vſed in ſport. Here then will I proceed to the defence of my ſecond argument, which is this, pag. 150.

To call God to ſitt in iudgment, where there is no

neceſſity ſo to doe, for the determining of trifles, is to tempt, nay to mocke God: But by the vſe of Lotts in ſport, God is called to ſitt in iudgment, where is no neceſſity, for the determining of trifles. By the vſe of Lotts in ſport therefore, we doe tempt, and dishonour God. This argument Mr. Gataker hath from Dan
                     •
                  eus that learned man of reverend memory. To proove the Aſſumption whereof, he alleadgeth theis wordes out of my Dialogue. A Lot in the nature thereof doth as neceſſarily ſuppoſe the Providence, and determining preſence of God, as an Oath, in the nature thereof, doth ſuppoſe the teſtifying preſence of God, yea ſo, that, as in an Oath, ſo in a Lot, prayer is expreſſed, or to be vnderſtood.
            
               
               Aunſw. The Aſſumption of the maine Argument is not true, but onely in extraordinary Lottes, vſed not with out ſpeciall direction. Yea rather, if a Lot be ſuch as is here ſaid, it is not lawful to vſe Lottes in any caſe whatſoever. Becauſe thereby we require a worke of God's immediate Power, and Providence, and ſo tempt God. And to ſpeake as the truth is. By this courſe, and force of this diſcourſe, the onely lawfull vſe of a Lot is condemned, & an vnlawfull vſe of it is allowed in the roome of it. Againe: An Oath, and a Lot are not alike. The compariſon therefore laide betweene them will not holde. For neither is the right of ought in an ordinary Lot, put to the ſpeciall providence, and imediate worke of God, as the truth of the thing teſtified is in an Oath, put to his Teſtimony: Neither is there in

every Lot any ſuch ſolemne invocation of God, as there is in an Oath ever, either expreſſed, or implied. For the definition of each thing conteineth the whole nature of the thing defined. Now a Lot may be defined without mention of Prayer, as appeareth in the definition thereof in the Dialogue: But ſo cannot an Oath. Therefore Prayer is not of the eſſence of a Lot. Neither doe the places, 1. Sam. 14. 41. Acts 1. 24. (whereof the former was a faithleſſe prayer) proove it. They proove onely, that prayer was ſometimes vſed before an extraordinary Lot, for an immediate Providence to direct the event of it. Which is not lawfull in ordinary Lotts. For in ſetting forth tithes, Levit. 27. 32. it was not lawfull to pray God to give a right Lot. In election of offices ſacred, or civill prayer

ought to be vſed, yet it followeth not therefore, that Prayer is part of the choiſe, or that therefore the Election, in the nature thereof, doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe a ſpeciall providence, and determining preſence of God. Laſtly, A Lott is not in it ſelfe an holy thing alwayes, and neceſſarily, as hath beene shewed, nor indeed was ever any ſo ſave extraordinarily. Therefore there is difference betweene Lotts and Oathes. Indeed, Whoſoever shall contemne an extraordinary Lot, he shall abuſe an holy thing, and Gods Name.
            
               Reply 2. To this long anſwer I might make a short reply. For whereas Mr. Gatakers maine ground is this. There is no immediate providence of God in an ordinary, as is in an extraordinrry Lot, and therevpon he buildeth theis anſweres, Therefore there is no tempting of God

by vſing Lotts in ſport: Therefore no prayer expreſſed, or to be vnderſtood is required in ordinary Lotts: and Therefore an ordinary Lot is not an holy thing in it ſelfe; I might, (referring my ſelfe to the defence of my former argument,) breifely reply, and ſay. There is an immediate providence in an ordinary Lot. Therefore God is tempted by vſing Lotts in ſporte: Therefore Prayer expreſſed, or to be vnderſtood, is required of them who vſe an ordinary Lot: and Therefore an ordinary Lot is an holy thing: But ſomething more in replying, will have more ſavour in reading. Therefore I firſt mervaile that M. G. forgetteth himſelfe in concluding. That all Lotts be vnlawfull, if there be an immediate providence in all Lotts. What? Were extraordinary Lotts vnlawfull too? Nay; He

vnderſtandeth an exception of them becauſe they were commaunded by God. So I ſay, ordinary Lotts were adviſed by God to end controverſies. Therefore vſing them, in that caſe, is no tempting of God. I mervaile alſo, why Mr. Gataker should ſo confidently affirme, that, by this courſe, that is, by maintaining an immediate Providence in all Lotts, an vnlawfull vſe of a Lott is allowed in the roome of the onely lawfull vſe. But I referre the diſcuſſing thereof to the defence of my 3. argument▪ Againe, It is to be obſerved, that he ſett's downe a compariſon betweene an Oath, and a Lott, which I ſett not downe, whereby the minde of the reader may be troubled▪ For I ſay not, As the Truth of a thing is, by an Oath, put to Gods Teſtimony: ſo in an ordinary Lot the R
                     •
                  ght of a thing is put

to Gods immediate Providence. This is that I ſay, As an Oath, in the nature thereof, ſuppo
                  •
               eth the testifying preſence of God: ſo a Lot, in the nature thereof, ſuppoſeth the determining preſence of God. My reaſon is, Ending a controverſy (I ſay not, Deciding a Right, for, before dividing the land of Promiſe by Lot, no tribe, or family could chalenge more Right to one portion, than to another) Ending (I ſay) a Controverſy is, by a Lot referred to God's determining the ſame by his whole, or immediate diſpoſing the vncertaine Lot) to a certaine event. It is alſo to be obſerved that in the 2. compariſon betweene an Oath, and a Lot, touching Prayer, he ſaith, Neither is there in every Lot any ſuch ſolemne invocation. Therefore in ſome Lot, that is, an extraordinary Lot, becauſe of an immediate Providence

to direct the event of it. For the ſame cauſe (ſay I) is prayer to be expreſſed, or vnderſtood in the vſe of an ordinary Lot too. But (ſaith Mr. Gataker) Prayer is of the eſſence of an Oath, and not of a Lott. I have ſaid nothing to the contrary; So that he might have ſpared his definition of a Lot: But becauſe he taketh a definition (ſuch as it is) out of my Dialogue, I will ſay ſomewhat thereto. The Definition (ſo called) is from Lyrd, viz. To vſe Lotts is by a variable event of ſome ſenſible thing to determine ſome doubtfull, or vncertaine matter. How is this matter to be determined indeed? Even by God's whole, or immediate diſpoſing the Lot. Hath God the principall hand in the determination? and Is not then Prayer to be expreſſed, or vnderſtood in a Lot, that is, in the managing by the vſers thereof?

Now then let vs conſider the places produced to proove it. The former (ſaith Mr. Gataker) was faithleſſe, I ſay ſo too, Becauſe that Lot was without any warrant. This (notwithſtanding Prayer in this, and the other place) doth shew that God's people beleiving that God doth ſignifie his iudgment by the whole, or immediate diſpoſing of that Lot, did therefore thinke themſelves bound to pray. But both theis Lotts were extraordinary, wherein was an immediate providence of God. Therefore they might well beleive they should pray. True; So all Chriſtians may, yea and muſt beleive they ought to pray in the vſing ordinary Lotts, becauſe of God's immediate Providence exerciſed therein. Nay▪ It was vnlawfull in ſetting out Tithe. If ſo▪ Not becauſe

it was an ordinary Lot (If a Lot) but becauſe the Lord expreſly ſaid Of all that goeth vnder the rodde the tenth shall be holy. The inſtance of election of offices is beſides the purpoſe- For it is not argued thus. Becauſe Gods people prayed when they vſed a Lot, therefore there is an immediate Providence of God in a Lot: But thus. There is an immediate Providence of God in a Lot, therefore Gods people prayed when they vſed a Lot. If then there be an immediate Providence of God in a Lot, and in regard thereof, Prayer is to be expreſſed, or vnderſtood in lawfull vſe of a Lot, then Praying and Playing, (though they rime well together, yet) runne not well together in the lawfull vſe of a Lot. Nay rather it followeth from both That a Lot is not to be vſed but in a caſe of neceſſity more, or leſſe; and Therefore

ſtra
                  •
               nge (I will not ſay abſurd) is Mr. Gataker his Poſition, pag. 111. to witt, The leſſe weighty the matter is wherein a Lot vſed, the lawfuller the Lot is. Except it be prooved, That the leſſe weighty the m
                  •
               tter is, the greater is the neceſſity of ending the controverſy by a Lot. The ſaid Poſition is more ſtrange becauſe he graunteth, pag. 95. That Prayer ſpecially applyed to the Lot may, (in ſome caſe,) be conceived, where the matter is more weighty, and the event of ſome conſequence, as in the choiſe of a Magiſtrate. But concerning this alſo more shall be ſaid in my next Reply. Lastly; It ſerves my turne that Mr. Gataker acknowledgeth that God's Name, and an Holy thing is abuſod whenſoever an extraordinary

Lot it contemned, becauſe an immediate Providence of God is therein. For the ſame cauſe an ordinary Lot is the Name of God and an Holy thing, and the
                  •
               efore not to be abufed in ſport. But Mr. Gataker hath shewen before that a Lot is not, in it ſelfe, an holy thing. Indeed; He would have shewen in his 3▪
                reaſon inducing him to allow luſorious Lotts▪ as not evill in themſelves, that a Lot is not holy either in it ſelfe, or by divine inſtitution. Wherevnto I have already anſwered ſomewhat. But having learned more (occaſionally) by his further diſpute, I will now, for ſome more ſatisfaction, anſwere ſomewhat more. A Lot (ſaith Mr▪ Gataker, pag. 132. and 133.) is not holy, either in it ſelfe, becauſe a Caſualty hath no holineſſe in it ſelfe; For then all Caſualties should be holy: or By divine inſtitution i

the Word, ſanctifying it to ſom
                  •
                holy vſe. I anſwere breifely. Is an extraordinary Lot the Name of God, an Holy thing in it ſelfe, becauſe of God's immediate Providence therein, and not an ordinary Lot in reſpect of the ſame Providence? If it be, Then, though all caſualties be not holy in themſelves, yet all lawfull Lotts be holy in themſelves. So that as

               he Bush that burnt, and waſted not, was holy, when God manifeſted himſelfe to Moſes in it, pag. 156, ſo a Lot is holy, becauſe of God's ſpeciall Preſence therein. Herein they differ. The Bush was holy but for a time, becauſe God was preſent in it but for a time: Whereas a Lot is holy from time to time, ſo oft as it is lawfully vſed, becauſe of God's ſpeciall preſence therein from

with a Lot, becauſe God's ſpeciall preſence is ever therein. Againe; I neede not proove that an ordinary Lot to ende controverſies is by divine inſtitution in the word, ſeeing Mr. Gataker graunteth that God in Prov. 18. 18. adviſeth vs to vſe it to that ende. But it is not ſanctified to an holy vſe. I have shewed otherwiſe. But what then? Is not a Lot therefore alwayes holy in it ſelfe, as Mr. Gataker ſaith in this paſſage? Were all extraordinary Lotts ſanctified to holy vſes? Yet Mr. Gataker deemeth them all holy in themſelves, becauſe of God's immediate Providence in them. Why may not I, for the ſame cauſe, thinke the ſame of all ordinary Lotts? And the rather, becauſe Mr. Gataker ſaith, pag.

                Marriage, being Gods Ordinaunce, is holy in it ſelfe: But (as he acknowledgeth, pag. 1.) a Lot is

Gods Ordinaunce; Therefore, from his graunt, a Lot is holy in it ſelfe. If then a Lot be holy in it ſelfe I conclude with Mr. Gataker, pag. 133. It may in no caſe, with no caution, be made matter of ſport. Now then I proceed to my 3. argument, which is this, pag. 166.

The Aſſumption is amplified by the like vſe of an Oath.
            
               Aunſ
                     •
                  . This Argumēt is faulty. But may be mended thus. That which God hath ſanctified to ſome proper vſe is not to be applied to any other, eſpeciala worſe. But God hath ſauctifyed

Lotts to this propre vſe, to witt, the deciding of Controverſies in matters of weight; A Lott therefore may not be applied to any other vſe, much leſſe to a worſe. But to aunſwere the argument. The Propoſition is graunted, if, [To Sanctiſie] be vnderſtood in a larger ſenſe, as meates are ſaid to be ſanctiſied, by God's word, for man's food, and The vnbeleiving mate ſanctified to the maried beleever, and if thereby be alſo vnderſtood the ſanctification, and approbation of the whole kinde. To the Aſſumption, and amplification thereof, it is anſwered. That place, Prov. 18. 18. doth not inioyne tho vſe of a Lot; Nor reſtraineth it to the ending of ſtrife, Much leſſe to the ending of great quarrells onely, For, ending ſtrife is but one vſe amongſt many, Ioshua, 7. 14.

               Reply 
                     •
                  . I would thanke Mr. Gataker for mending mine argument, though there be not any great neede, if he had not put into his Aſſumption theis wordes [In matters of weight] for his owne purpoſe, as shall appeare, But to the matter. In mine vnderſtanding, and meaning, the Propoſition doth ſufficiently expreſſe all that which mooveth Mr. Gataker to graunt it. Well, Then let vs conſider his oppoſition made to the Aſſumption, and the amplification thereof. Doth Mr. Gataker
               
imply a Lot not be ſanctified, becauſe (as he ſaith now peremptorily) it is not inioyned? What! Is Recreation (in generall) inioyned by precpt, if not directly, yet (at leaſt) by iuſt conſequence, as Mr. Gataker in his allowance of luſorious Lotts, ſaith is graunteth by all, pag. 138? and is not ſo vſefull an Ordinance, as is a Lot, to end Controverſies, inioyned by precept either directly, or by iuſt conſequence? Doth God more carefully provide for recreation, than for peace amongſt his people? But Mr. Gataker is not ſo peremptory in an other place, pag. 135. where he ſaith. The vſe of Lotts is not ſimply commaunded, For. Prov. 18. 18. is Rather a permiſſion than a precept, & Not ſo much a commaundement as an adviſe, & counſaile. I will come to an iſſue. If it will pleaſe M. G. to ſet downe his iuſt conſequence

to proove Recreation inioyned by precept, I will vndertake to ſett downe as iuſt a conſequence to proove, that a Lot to end a Controverſy is likewiſe inioyned by precept. In meane while I cannot be perſwaded that our God of peace,Pſal. 34▪ 14. who commaundeth vs to ſeeke peace, and follow after it, and hath ordeined a Lot, wherein he is ſpecially preſent by his immediate providence, to end controverſies, which otherwiſe cannot be ended conveniently, doth leave vs at liberty in that caſe, to vſe, or not to vſe a Lot. But ſuppoſe the vſe of a Lot be not (thus) inioyned, yet doth not Gods counſel (which me thinkes is a cōmandemēt though it be ſaid of mans conſell that it is no commaundement) ſanctify it to be vſed to end controverſies. This (I thinke) will not be denied: But it is denied That the vſe of a Lot is reſtrained to end

controverſies, much leſſe great quarrelles onely, and ſundry inſtances are given of vſing Lotts to other endes than to end controverſies. But all thoſe Lotts were extraordinary. Therefore, whereas in the beginning of this anſwere where he would finde fault with mine argvment, he ſaith, That the vſe of Lotts in play is ever to decide ſome queſtion, or controverſy, though a light one (it is like) yet a queſtion, or controverſy truely ſo tearmed, otherwiſe it were no Lot. If he meane a Lot in generall, then (with his favour) he forgetteth himſelfe in ſaying Lotts, by him quoted were not to end controverſies: If he ſpeake of a Lot in play, as being an ordinary Lot, then he faileth in iudgment, In denying that the vſe of ordinary Lotts (whereof is the queſtion) is reſtrained to end controverſies, and The

inſtances which he giveth being extraordinary Lotts, are not to the point. Beſides: The ſubiect-matter of an extraordinary Lot being by God's ſpeciall direction, if it be lawfull, there may (happily) be no preſent controverſy. Whereas, the ſubiect-matter of an ordinary Lot, being ſomething queſtioned betweene man, & man, there may be a great controverſy. I ſay, May be, For if it be well obſerved, in an ordinary Lot there is not alwayes a preſent controverſy to be determined: But alwayes ſome queſtion to be decided to prevent a controverſy. As may appeare by Mr. Gatakers owne wordes, partly here, where he ſaith [That there muſt be ſome queſtion, or controverſy, or elſe it is no Lot,] but more evidently, where he ſaith: That the Lot vſed by the ſouldiers about Chriſt his garments, which he truly calleth

a ſerious diviſory Lot, was to prevent all contention, and ſtrife, pag. 176. & 177. Such was the Lot alſo which was vſed about dividing, the Land of Promiſe, about which was no preſent controverſy. For God, who would have no controverſies, whould have alſo ſuch things remooved which may cauſe, or iuſtly occaſion controverſies. Therefore Chriſt expounding the commaundement.Math. 5. 21. 22. Thou shallt not kill, forbiddeth wordes of provocation. About which ordinary Lot, God, who knoweth how ordinary or common, controverſies, and the occaſions thereof be, giveth direction in Prov. 18. 18. That which is ſaid of an ordinary Lot may iuſtly be alſo ſaid of an Oath, that the vſe of it is ſanctified to end controverſies by preſent determination, or prevention. For, as it is true, that Heb. 6. 16. implieth, that Gods Oath

to man is more inviolable, than an Oath from man to man, whereof onely, M. G. taketh knowledge, ſo itpa, 17
                     •
                  . is true, that Heb. 6. 16. intimateth, That, as an Oath, for confirmation, is amongſt men an end of all ſtrife▪ ſo Gods Oath for confirmation of his promiſe to Abraham, was to put the matter out of doubt, queſtion▪ or controverſy▪ Elſe, theis wordes 
                  ▪An end of all ſtrife] were to no purpoſe. But that they were to the purpoſe by me vnderſtood, appeareth in the 2▪ 
               uext verſ. where it is written. That God bound himſelfe by Oath as to shew the stableneſſe of his Counſell, ſo that the heires of promiſe might have ſtrong couſolation. So that Gods Oath to Abraham tooke away doubting, queſtioning, & all ſtrife that might be, not onely in Abrahās minde, but alſo in the mindes of the heires of promiſe. Therefore an Oath doth not onely end preſēt cōtroverſies, according to

               M. G. vnderſtanding, but confirming a promiſe▪ or covenant doth alſo ende a ſtrife, though there be none preſent, when the Oath is given, to wit, by Prevention. Now let vs ſomewhat conſider Mr. Gatakers purpoſe in putting into the Aſſumption, theis wordes▪ 
               [In matters of weight.▪
                Forſooth, By denying the the ſame, to make way for light matters, and conſequently for playing with Lottes. Becauſe (as he ſaith, pag. 130.) they beſt agree with the nature of Lotts, that is, with vncertaine hazard. Surely, If Mr. Gataker had acknowledged God's ſpeciall preſence by his immediate Providence in a Lot, as being a Lot ordained by God, to end controverſies, he would not have ſo written, but deemed weighty matters beſt agreeing with the nature of a Lot. It is true that a matter of leſſe weight in it

ſelfe may be the ſubiect-matter of a controverſy, as a controverſy may be among men, as well meane, as might, yin their ſtate, as Mr. Gataker here ſaith pa. 137. For by mighty men (as in Gen. 6. 4. ſo) in Prov. 18. 18. are meant Men ſtrong in their affections, ſo as the controverfy cannot be well ended without a Lot, whether the ſubiect-matter of the Controverſy be of more, or leſſe weight in it ſelfe; ſo as there is a neceſſity that one or both parties be ſatisfied. For otherwiſe there may be a great quarrell about a matter of leſſe weight. Neither doe I ſay, that onely great quarrells are to be ended, or prevented by a Lot, as Mr. Gataker denieth not, but ſome may. For (as he ſaith truly, pag. 173.) God ſpeaketh in Prov. 18. 18. of contentions in generall. Here then we may enter into further conſideration

of that which Mr. Gataker writeth, pag. 135. to wit. That, by the force of our diſcourſe againſt playing with a Lot, the onely lawfull vſe is condemned
                  •
               , and an vnlawfull vſe is allowed in the roome thereof. What is that Onely lawfull vſe of a Lot? I can finde none other than The putting of that to a Lot which he calleth (pag. 130.) A matter of mere indifferency, that is, Such as is not materiall, whether a man doe, or omitt: Howſoever there may be a lawfull vſe of a Lot about ſuch a matter queſtioned to determine, or prevent a Controverſy, yet I wonder that Mr. Gataker deemeth it that onely lawfull. Doth not he graunt, pag. 91. That Prayer ſpecially applyed to a Lot may be conceived in weighty matters, as in the choiſe of a Magiſtrate, which is not a matter of mere indifferency, that is, ſuch

as is not materiall whether it be done or omitted. Did God ſpecially appoint Lotts to be vſed about onely matters of weight? and muſt man ſo farre ſwerve from Gods example as to ſtrive onely about matters of ſuch indifferency, and then to putt onely ſuch, controverted, to the determination of a Lot? So that I doubt not but that with found iudgment, and a cleare conſcience not accuſing me of not duely reſpecting the ſpeciall Providence, of God by his immediate diſpoſing of a Lot, I may affirme. That the more weighty the ſubiect-matter of a controverſy is, the more iuſtifiable is the Controverſy: and Be that matter of more or leſſe weight, the greater the neceſſity of ending a Controverſy is, the more iuſtifiable is the vſe of a Lot. Is not then playing with a Lot an irreligious abuſing

of Gods Ordinance? But (faith Mr. Gataker glad of any thing to pleade for playing with a Lot.) The vſe of a Lot in play is ever to decide ſome queſtion, or controverſy truely ſo tearmed. If ſo, Then he might have called it a ſerious Lot, according to his doctrine, the lightneſſe of the ſubiect-matter controverted, notwithſtanding. But whereabout is that ſuppoſed Controverſy? Mr. Gataker in his written anſwere to my Dialogue, before mentioned, ſayth. The Controverſy tendeth to Victory, which till it be decided, there is a Controverſy though a light one, yet a Controverſy, truely ſo tearmed. But is that truely or worthily to be called A Victory, which falleth out by hap-hazard (according to M. Gatakers eſteeming a Lot) without any deſert? But (ſay I) Is it not a tempting of God to put

him, by his immediate Providence in diſpoſing the Lot, to humour (I ſay not, honour) ſome of the vaine glorious fooles with ſuppoſed Victory, who make a pretended controverſy there-about, whereas (before they intended to play with a Lot) there was none indeed? Is this a Controverſy truly ſo tearmed? I need ſay no more, and therefore proceed to the laſt argumēt (whereof, but part is mine) It is this, pag. 173.
            
            That, which there is neither precept for, nor practiſe of, in GodsDial. 4▪
                word, generall, or ſpeciall, expreſſed or implied, that there is no warrant for in the word: But ſuch is the vſe of Lotts in game. For we reade in Scripture that Lotts were vſed, but in ſerious matters onely, both by Iewes, and Gentiles; Neither is there any warrant in the Word for the ludicrous vſe of

them, by precept, or practiſe, generall, or ſpeciall, expreſſed, or implied, There is no warrant therefore for luſorious Lotts in Gods word.
            
               Aunſw. The Propoſition is vnſound. For an argument holdeth (indeed) from the Negative in matters of Faith, but not in matters of Fact. Mnch leſſe may a man reaſon from a matter of Fact, to a matter of Right negatively. For many things are of ordinary vſe, whereof there is no mention at all in Gods Word, which yet all generally allow, as2. ſugar for ſweetning, &c. Secondly; An action may have warrant ſufficiently by permiſſion, without precept, or practiſe. For where God hath not limited the vſe of any creature, or Ordinance, there he hath left the vſe of it free: Where he hath not determined the Circumſtances of any action, there,

what he hath not prohibited, that he hath permitted. For this cauſe,Ier. 7. 31 & 19. 5. Col. 2. 22 23. Deu. 12 30. 31. 32 in the point of Gods worship, the argument holdeth from the Negative, for the ſubſtance of it. Becauſe God hath determined it: But in civil affaires, it will not holde from the Negative to diſallow ought, becauſe God hath not determined them.
            
               Reply 4. 
               Mr. Gataker in his booke sheweth many inſtances of Lotts vſed both by Iewes, and Gentiles, and all in ſerious matters. Which intimateth to me, that they, by the light not onely of the Word, but of nature too, diſcerned, that Lotts are to be vſed onely in ſerious matters. O let vs take heed how we put out ſo great light. But let vs conſider his anſwere, which is onely to the Propoſition, though I have already confuted many principall parts thereof. In my Dialogue to shew

that the Spirit ſometime reaſoneth from a matter of Fact to a matter of right, negatively, I quote theis Scriptures, Iohn 8. 39. 40. 1. Cor. 11. 16. The wordes of the former be theis, Yee goe about to kill me, a man that hath tolde you the truth; This did not Abraham. The argument is this Abraham did not kill any that tolde him the truth, Therefore yee ought not goe about to kill me, if yee would be ſonnes of Abraham. This is Christ his Logicke, wherewith I dare finde no fault: Neither doth Mr. Gataker. For he ſaith nothing to it, becauſe the Printer putteth for verſ. 40. the 48. verſ. wherewith Mr. Gataker maketh paſtime, but I will let paſſe time now to take further knowledge of it. Of the other quotation the wordes be theis. We have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of God. The conſequent implied is. Therefore nomen ought
               
               not to pray vncovered. Herevnto Mr. Gataker anſwereth indeed, but ſo, that he doth not deny that Paul argueth negatively from a matter of Fact to a matter of Right. Which is all that I intended by the quotation, and not, to imagine this argument. The Churches of God, and faithfull men doe not vſe Lotts in gaming▪ Therefore ſuch gaming is vnlawfull. So that I neede not herein reply vpon Mr. Gataker, I onely wonder that he ſaith. The vſe of Lotts in games hath beene common in the Churches of God. What! In the publicke Aſſemblies? as was the fault of women their heads vncovered in the Church at Corinth? But Mr. Gataker in this anſwer ſpeaketh of things merely naturall, or civill, as ſweetning with ſugar, &c. I will not now indeavour to proove that in the Word there is matter of iuſt conſequence

either generall, or implied (which is a part of the propoſition) to allow as well ſweetning with ſugar, &c. as Recreation in generall, and therefore they may be lawfull though they be not mentioned in the Word. But ſuppoſe M. Gatakers axiome holdeth in them, what is that to Lotts, wherein is the Name of God by his immediate providence, and the vſe whereof is limited to ende ſerious controverſies? In regard whereof doubt I not but an argument concerning the vſe of them, may holde from the Negative in matter of Fact, as well as in matter of Faith, or of the point of Gods worship for the ſubſtance of it. For I preſume that as Abraham would not, if he had had occaſion, as he did not, kill a man that tolde him the truth: ſo that all who feared God, and knew the nature, and vſe of a Lot, would not,

as they did not, vſe a Lot in game. Secondly. Why may not there be for2. a thing permitted, ſome precept in the Word, generall, or implied? The permiſſion of any thing muſt be in the Word, either expreſſe or by iuſt conſequence, and then the thing ſo permitted is indifferent. But Mr. Gataker reconſileth theis two axiomes [Every action is indifferent,] & [No action is indifferent,] thus, Every naked and bare action ſimply conceived, is indifferent: But, No action cladde with his particular circumſtances, is indifferent, pag. 94. So that, he concludeth it to be moſt true, That no particular morall action, or No action of the reaſonable creature, proceeding from reaſon, can poſſibly be ſo indifferent, but it muſt of neceſſity, be either conformable to the rules of Gods holy word, or diſconformable therevnto, pag. 95.
               
Theis things, eſpecially theis wordes (Rules of Gods Word, conſidered,) I may ſay, that howſoever a naked indifferent thing be by permiſſion, yet a clothed indifferent thing, if lawfull, is by precept, or rule, as well as Mr. Gataker ſaith, Recreation in generall, is both by permiſſion, and by precept, if not expreſly, yet by iuſt conſequence pag. 138. Doth then Mr. Gataker make permiſſion a iuſt exception againſt the Propoſition? Touching his proofe that Permiſſion is a ſufficient1. warrant: I first would know what ordinance of God that is, which hath not ſome limited, or appointed vſe thereof. I am ſure, and have shewed, that Gods ordinance
                  
                     •
                  . touching a Lot, hath. Secondly, I greive to obſerve what a gappe Mr. Gataker hath, by this doctrine, opened to Licentiouſneſſe. What! may man diſpoſed to finne, imploy

any creature, whoſe vfe God hath not limited, to what vſe he will? No; For here is to be vnderſtood that exception which is expreſſed in the next part of the reaſon touching circumſtances, viz [Any vſe, but that which is prohibited] Howſoever I could demurre the revpon, eſpecially if an expreſſe prohibition be vnderſtood, yet herein I will be ſilent having enough graunted me. For the vſe of Lotts in game is prohibited by iuſt conſequences, as I have demonſtrated. For the better vnderſtanding of the 2. part of the reaſon, (haſting to an end) I onely deſire an anſwere to this queſtion. Is any vſe of a Lot lawfull where the circumſtances of Time, Place, and Perſons be not determined? If Mr. Gataker except an extraordinary vſe, I may as well except the luſorious vſe of Lotts, In anſwere to the exemplification

of this reaſon, graunting that an argument holdeth from the Negative for the ſubſtance of Gods Worshippe, I yet make this Quaere. Whether, onely becauſe God hath determined it? For in thoſe places of Ieremy, God doth blame his people onely for vſing a worship [which he commaunded not], without any intimation that he preſcribed his owne worship. To the ſame purpoſe writeth Paul to the Coloſsians againſt traditions of men, and will-worship, not for Mr. Gatakers cauſe, but becauſe in ſo worshipping they held not the Head, ver. 19. which is Christ, King of his Church teaching, and governing the ſame in all things. But in Deut. Mr. Gatakers cauſe is implied. It is true, that there God forbiddeth his people to inquire how other nations ſerved their Gods, and ſendeth them to his word to obſerve

the ſame, without putting anything to, or taking out from the ſame. Surely, I should not gather from hence Mr. Gatakers cauſe, as being the onely cauſe; Becauſe I feare it would incourage Papists in their ſuperſtitious rites, and ceremonies called Circumstances, though, indeed, parts of the ſubſtance of Gods outward worship. For they are to ready to take holde thereof and ſay God hath determined nothing touching theis ſuppoſed Circumſtances, & they are not againſt the word of God, therefore they are permitted, and ſo warranted. But I should gather from that, and the other places (I thinke directly, and not auckwardly) this concluſion. Becauſe all things in, & vnto the ſervice of God ought to be preciſely according to Gods Will revealed in his word, therefore whatſoever is not commaunded

ought not to be. And the rather (God being jealous) becauſe of th

                   whoring. To the laſt I anſwere. That a Lot is no more a Civill affaire, than is an Oath, though it, (as is an Oath,) be vſed in Civill affaires. And lastly, I affirme againe, that God hath determined the vſe of a Lot to determine controverſies, ſo as, without Gods ſpeciall appointment, (which is not now to be expected,) it cannot be lawfully vſed to any other purpoſe; Therefore an argument from the Negative will holde by Mr. Gatakers rule, to diſallow the vſe of any other Lot, as well luſorious, as divinatory. Thus having anſwered Mr. Gatakers
               
reaſons inducing him to allow Luſorious Lotts as not evill in themſelves, and remooved Mr. Gatakers anſweres to mine arguments, I may more confidently holde mine opinion, which Mr. Dudley Fennor (of reverend memory) his godly treatiſe of Recreations hath taught me▪ to witt, That Tables, and Cardes, as well as Dice, and all other games conſisting in cha
