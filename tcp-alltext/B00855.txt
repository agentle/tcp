                     A moſt rare, ſtrange, and wonderfull accident, which by Gods juſt judgement was brought to paſſe, not farre from Rithin in Wales, and ſhowne upon three moſt wicked perſons, who had ſecretly and cunningly murdered a young Gentleman named David Williams, that by no meanes it could be knowne, and how in the end it was revenged by a childe of five yeeres old, which was in his Mothers wombe, and unborne when the deed was done.
                  
                  To the tune of, Wigmores Galliard.
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     GIve eare unto my ſtory true,
                     you graceleſſe men on earth:
                     Which any way in ſecret ſéeke
                     your neighbours timeleſſe death.
                     Not many pleaſant Summers paſt
                     this wicked worke was done,
                     Which thrée accurſed kinſmen wrought
                     againſt their Vnckles ſonne.
                  
                  
                     A kind and courteous Gentleman,
                     his aged Fathers joy,
                     The onely heire into his Lands
                     that ſhould his place enjoy.
                     His envious Nephewes gaping ſtill,
                     his day of death to ſée,
                     Thought every yéere that he did live,
                     ſeven yéer
                           •
                        s and more to bée.
                  
                  
                     Becauſe this gentle Gentleman,
                     once being laid in grave,
                     Their aged Vnckle being dead,
                     they ſhould the living have:
                     The thought whereof did often make
                     their hearts with joy abound,
                     For that they knew the living worth
                     each yéere an hundred pound.
                  
                  
                     But when they ſaw this toward Youth
                     live up to mans eſtate,
                     And to himſelfe hath likewiſe choſe
                     a faithfull loving mate,
                     Then were they out of hope and heart,
                     but moſt, when they did ſée
                     His beautious wife in little ſpace,
                     moſt big with child to bée.
                  
                  
                     Then did the Divell intice them ſtraight
                     to murther, death, and blood,
                     Thereby to purchaſe to themſelves
                     their long deſired good.
                     A hundred waies they did deviſe
                     this Gentleman to kill:
                     But yet his wife being big with child,
                     ſtuck in their ſtomack ſtill.
                  
                  
                     If we ſhould ſlay the one, they ſaid,
                     and let the other live,
                     No comfort to our hearts deſire
                     that déed at all would give:
                     The brat new bred within her wombe,
                     none can for heire deny:
                     Therefore 'tis méet and requiſite,
                     that both of them ſhould die.
                  
                  
                     And for to blind the eyes of men,
                     ſtrange garments had they got,
                     VVhich to performe that wicked déed
                     they onely did allot.
                     And after this moſt bad pretence,
                     the Gentleman each day,
                     Still felt his heart to throb and faint,
                     and ſad he was alway.
                  
                  
                     His ſléepe was full of dreadfull dreames,
                     in bed where he did lie,
                     His heart was heavie in the day,
                     yet knew no reaſon why,
                     And oft as he did ſit at meate,
                     his noſe moſt ſuddenly,
                     Would ſpring and guſh out crimſon blood,
                     and ſtraight it would be dry.
                  
                  
                     It chanced ſo upon a time,
                     as he his ſupper ate,
                     His eyes and heart ſo heavie were,
                     that he ſlept at his meate,
                     Now fie, then quoth his loving wife,
                     and woke him preſently,
                     Why is my Deare ſo drowſie now?
                     quoth he, I know not, I.
                  
                  
                     Good wife, he ſaid, let us goe walke
                     about our Land a while,
                     I ſhall be wakened thorowly,
                     when I have walkt a mile.
                     His wife agréed, and forth they went,
                     moſt kindly arme in arme:
                     But ſuddenly were they eſpied,
                     that thought on little harme.
                  
                  
                     At length thrée ſturdy men they met,
                     in Souldiers tattered ragges,
                     With ſwords faſt girt unto their ſides,
                     which tangled in their jagges:
                     Their faces ſmear'd with durt and ſoote,
                     in lothſome beaſtly wiſe,
                     With black thrumb'd hats upon their heads
                     as is the Germanes guiſe.
                  
                  
                     And when they ſaw no perſons nie,
                     thoſe helpeleſſe couple then,
                     They wounded ſore in cruell ſort,
                     like moſt accurſed men,
                     And in the thickeſt of the corne,
                     which in that place was hie,
                     They drag'd the murdred bodies then,
                     and ſo away did hie.
                  
                  
                     And ſoone they ſhifted off their rags,
                     and hid them by the way,
                     And weaponleſſe they homeward went,
                     clad in their owne array.
                     Long did the ſilly ſervants waite
                     their Maſters comming home,
                     Which dead within the field did lie,
                     all bath'd in bloody fome.
                  
                  FINIS.

                  The ſecond part of the Murder of David Williams, and his Wife being great with childe, which was revenged by a childe of five yeeres old, which was in his Mothers wombe, and unborne when the deed was done.
                  To the tune of, Wigmores Galliard.
                  
                  
                     AT length, when dark and gloomy clouds
                     had ſhadowed all the skie,
                     The ſervants wandred up and downe,
                     their Maſter to eſpie:
                     And as they paſt along the place
                     where theſe were lately ſlaine,
                     Within the corne they heard one grone,
                     as heart would breake in twaine.
                  
                  
                     And running ſtraight to ſearch and ſée,
                     who gave this gaſtly ſound:
                     Their Maſter dead their Miſtris ſtab'd,
                     yet living there they found,
                     In bitter pangs in travell then
                     this woefull woman lay,
                     And was delivered of a Sonne,
                     before the breake of day.
                  
                  
                     Then died ſhe incontinent,
                     no memory had ſhe
                     For to deſcry the murtherers,
                     nor found they could not be.
                     They both together buried were,
                     the child to Nurſe was ſet,
                     Which thriv'd and proſper'd paſſing well,
                     no ſickneſſe did him let.
                  
                  
                     But now behold Gods judgement juſt:
                     the truth I ſhall you tell,
                     Ere this child was ſeven quarters old,
                     this ſtrange event befell:
                     One of the murtherers being ſet
                     at Tables on a day,
                     The Nurſe did chance to bring this child
                     within that place to play.
                  
                  
                     The child under the Table got,
                     unthought of any one,
                     And bit his Couſin by the legge,
                     hard at the ankle bone,
                     Which by no helpe nor Art of man
                     could èver healed be,
                     But ſweld and rotted in ſuch ſort,
                     that thereof dyed he.
                  
                  
                     Not full a twelve-month after this,
                     this child did chance to be,
                     Whereas the ſecond murderer
                     was drinking merrily:
                     He tooke one of the biggeſt pinnes
                     that ſtuck about his breſt,
                     And thruſt it in his Kinſmans thigh,
                     where then the ſigne did reſt.
                  
                  
                     Which done, he laughing ran his way,
                     the wound did bléed amaine:
                     By no meanes could they ſtanch the blood,
                     nor eaſe his extreme paine.
                     The griefe and anguiſh was ſo great,
                     which thereof did procéed,
                     That ere thrée dayes were fully paſt,
                     the man to death did bléed.
                  
                  
                     The child with rods was ſwing'd full ſore,
                     for this unhappy act,
                     Yet never would forgiveneſſe aſke
                     for his committed fact.
                     Thus paſt it on, untill the time
                     this child was five yéeres old:
                     The other murderer living ſtill
                     with conſcience bad, behold,
                  
                  
                     He never after ſaw the child,
                     but he would ſhun the place,
                     The child did never looke on him,
                     but with a frowning face:
                     And ſtones at him ſtill would he fling,
                     where ere he did him méete:
                     Which made the neighbours wonder much
                     that oftentimes did ſée't.
                  
                  
                     In Harveſt next this little child,
                     with other boyes beſide,
                     Went to the Fields, and open mouth'd,
                     this man aſléepe they ſpide:
                     The child having a bramble ſticke,
                     within his hand to play,
                     Did thruſt it downe his Couſins throat,
                     a ſleeping as he lay.
                  
                  
                     The man therewith being ſoone awak't,
                     did ſtrive to pull it out:
                     And he thereby did rent and teare
                     his wind-pipe round about:
                     Which being found incurable,
                     as he lay in his bed,
                     His murderous déed he did confeſſe,
                     as you before have read.
