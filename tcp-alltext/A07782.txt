A plaine and succinct resolution, of sundry very intricate and important points of religion, which doe mightily assaile the weake consciences of the vulgar sort of people; penned for the solace of all true hearted English subiects, and for the vtter confusion of all seditious Iesuites and Iesuited Popelings in England or else where, so long as they shall persist inordinately in their nouelties, heresies, errours, and most grosse and palpable superstions.

               HAuing published many bookes in defence of the truth, against the aduersaries of the truth, (the Pope, his Cardinals, Iesuites, and Iesuited Popelings I meane) and perceiuing by many arguments, that sundry of my deare Country men are not yet fully resolued in certain maine points of religion, vpon which all the rest, in some sort, do depend; I haue deemed it a labour very necessary for the common good, to dispute those most intricate points pro & contra Dialogue-wise; that so all difficulties therein may bee cleered, all obscurity taken away, and the truth plainly laid open, before the eyes of euery indifferent reader.
            The Papists most impudently bragge and boast, that they maintaine, keepe and defend that faith and doctrine which S. Peter and S. Paul, deliuered to the

Romans, that neither their Pope, nor their Church can erre, that their Church, and none but their Church, is able to shew and truly to proue a perpetuall vninterrupted succession of their Bishops and Priests: that the written word of God containeth not all things necessary to be beleeued vnto saluation, for that it sheweth not the holy Bible to be canonical and that originall sinne remaineth only materially in the bodies of the regenerate, and not formally in their mindes, wils, and hearts. All these points, and euery of them (though most difficult and intricate) I haue taken in hand to confute, relying vpon Gods holy assistance, who neuer forsaketh the truth. What I haue performed, let your wisedomes and others iudge. The work such as it is, I dedicate to your worships, not only to giue as a signe of a gratefull minde for your kinde fauours to me-ward; but much more to intimate to the world, that inward ioy of mine heart, which issueth out of your rare zeale to Gods eternall truth, constant loyalty to your most gracious Soueraigne, and painefull labours for the good of our Church and Common-weale. The almighty giue you many happy yeares vpon earth, and vouchsafe to increase his manifold graces in you, that you may dayly more and more (and others by your Christian example) imploy your painefull labours for the aduancement of his glorious Gospell, the cutting downe of sinne, the extirpation of late start-vp▪ Popery, and the rooting out of all traiterous Iesuites, and Iesuited Popelings, which

haue beene, and still are, too much fauoured and winked at, by sundry in authority, especially in these North-parts of noble England. Dixi. March. 21. 1609.

               This is a wonderment to me, that our Popes, Monkes, and Iesuites, haue beene so licentious and wicked liuers: but seeing so many famous Popish writers and the

late secular. Romish Priests, haue in printed bookes published to the whole world, testified so much of and against them, it maketh me to stagger, and to doubt of the Romith religion, although informer times, I haue high reuerenced the same: for if the Bishop of Rome had beene priuiledged not to erre, not onely the Bishop of Rome, but the holy fathers also of that age, would haue obiected the same against S. Cyprian, vndoubtedly it cannot be denied.

               The Catholikes hold constantly, that the true faith and religion which S. Peter and S.

               You know there is a sort of Fryers at Rome, commonly called the Franciscans, (which sect was hatchedThe sect of Franciscans. and borne in the yéere 1206.) who haue by little and little swarued from their first institution, and become so licentious and dissolute, that another sect of Fryers commonlyTheophilus a Citisen of Rome. called Capuchéenes, (which thing, you béeing a Citizen of Rome, knowe aswell as my selfe.) haue accused them to haue depraued and fowly peruerted the rules of their auncient order, sect, and profession, in so much, as they cannot this day with safe consciences embrace the same, and therefore haue they reformed their said sect, and doe terme themselues the reformed true Franciscans indéede: this (if it be duely considered,) is doubtlesse this day our case, in our Church of noble England, as also of many other reformed Churches, within

               Remig.
               How the late Bishops of Rome are S. Peters successors, it shall be shewed (God willing) in the chapter of succession. Let vs now vnfold, and sincerely examine, the faith and doctrine of some speciall Popes in particular, for the view and consideration of a few will be a sufficient tryall for all the rest.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I must needes yeeld thereunto, for we hold it a part of the Catholike faith, that Christs prayer was effectuall for all S. Peters successors alike, so as if any one of them can be conuinced to haue erred, we cannot safely relie and ground our faith vpon the rest.

               That the Bishops or Popes of Rome (as ye call them,) may become heretikes, yea, that they haue béene heretikes de facto, it is a thing so cleare, as I shall not neede to stand long vpon the same: for, many popish decrées and Papall constitutions tell vs, that Popes may be deposed, when and so often as they swarue from the true faith, and become heretikes indéede: which decrées and constitutions must perforce presuppose, that the Popes may be heretikes indéede: for otherwise, theyGrat dist. 4

                   or heresie. For, if the Pope when he spake or wrote sate in S. Peters chaire at Rome, (an old rotten and worme-eaten thing, which the silly people adore, reuerence, and kisse,

as my selfe sometimes haue done, and Saint Peter perhaps neuer saw or knew the same) then the case is cléere, the Popes decrée is as sound as the holy Gospel, and procéedeth from the holy Ghost.
            
            
               Theoph.
               All this is very true, and we are taught to beleeue, that Saint Peter sate in that chaire indeede, and that it hath beene reuerently kept from Saint Peters death to this day, insomuch that they are likewise taught to bring girdles to touch the said chaire, which therefore are called Saint Peters girdles for the safe deliuerance of women which are with child, and doe vse them: neither did I euer heare to this day, that any Pope taught false Doctrine, or decreed any vntruth out of Saint Peters chaire.
            
            
               Remig.
               Whether Saint Peter euer sate in that chaire or not, it is not much materiall; this one thing is certaine, that it is this day most superstitiously abused and that the real sitting in the material chaire, cannot preserue him that sitteth in it, from false doctrine or erroneous faith, whereof more at large hereafter, as your demandes or difficulties shal minister fit occasion; that many Popes haue béene Heretiques and flat Apostataes, is already proued out of your owne best approued Doctors. Now will I likewise proue vnto you (God willing) euen by the expresse testimonies of most renowned Popish writers; that sundry Popes haue taught and decréed false doctrine, and that as publique persons sitting in Saint Peters chaire, as they call it, and that done.

What say you to this testimony, M.

               Your reasons are so strong, so pithy, and so plaine indeed, that I know not in the world how in truth to answere them, they make me to stagger in my old Romish faith, and to doubt of that, whereof I neuer doubted all my life before: for, we Catholiques haue euer holden it for an article of our Catholique faith, that the Pope as Pope and publique person cannot erre: and therefore that they are to bee censured for Heretiques, whosoeuer will not receiue and beleeue, as articles of the Christian faith, whatsoeuer the Pope defineth iudicially and publiquely, as sitting in Peters chaire.
            
            
               Remig.
               This lately coyned diabolicall distinction of the Popes double person, with the circumstances wherewith it is adorned, may fitly be tearmed a trick of Legierdemaine,A tricke of Legierdemaine. wherewith many haue béene seduced a long time. For, when the Pope is charged and plainely conuicted to haue decréed false and erroneous doctrine to bée holden for articles of the faith; then the Pope and his Iesuites, with their Iesuited broode, tell vs peremptorily,

and as it were violently enforce vs to beléeue it, that such decrées procéede from the Popes Holinesse, as a priuate man, but not as a publique person. What a thing is this? if the Pope decrée any thing, how absurd soeuer it be, andA most blasphemous doctrine. affirme the same to be his iudiciall sentence out of Peters chaire, then the same must be holden and be beléeued for an article of faith, and to be as true as the Gospell of Iesus Christ; and he that will not so hold, and so beléeue, must be burnt for an Heretique: & for all this, no Scripture, no generall Councell, no holy Father, no learned Popish Writer, for y• space of 1400. yeares after Christs sacred incarnation, (my life and saluation I gage for theMarke this well. tryall) can be truely produced or alleaged for the confirmation and clearing of such Popish dotage, or rather of such diabolical heresie, and neuer-inough detested villany.

               Your words doe penetrate, and touch the very bottome of my heart: but is it possible, that you can prooue and iustifie this your assertion? if you can this performe, popery is confounded and striken dead.

Gregory the 12., and Benedict the 13.) deposed by

the same councell, and the constant resolution of the councell against the Popes fasly challenged priuiledges: as namely, that the Pope as Pope and as he is a publike person, neither is nor can be an infallible iudge in matters of faith.

First that Pope Celestine erred, and that, not as a priuate man, but euen as Pope and publike person. Secondly, that he erred in a very serious matter, euen in a matter of faith, to wit, that matrimony was so dissolued, by reason of heresie, that the faithfull man or woman might marry again, the hereticall party liuing: which thing saith Alphonsus, (a great learned man, and a zealous papist,) was manifest to euery man to be an heresie: and the popish late councell of Trent, hath defined so to be. Thirdly, that this decrée and definition of Pope Celestine, was in those daies enrolled in the Popes decretalls. Fourthly, that Alphonsus both saw and read the same decrée. Fiftly, that the said decrée cannot this day be found among the Popes decretall epistles: so then, the Popes vse to change, not onely their faith, but also their decrées.

               I see well, that simple people are shamfully abused, and that the late Popes haue egregiously seduced them: for this is a case so cleare, as euery child may perceiue the same: that which the Pope and his Iesuits tell vs of his double person, is but atrick of Legerdemarie. For Alphonsus saith plainely and resolutely (I see it cannot bee denied) that Pope Celestine erred as Pope and publique person, and not as a priuate man.

               Let this testimony neuer bee forgotten: for, it ouerthroweth and beateth flat to the ground, the chiefest bulwarke, and strongest sort of all popish faith. It condenmeth the Pope and his doctrine, both affirmatiuely & negatiuely. Affirmatiuely, because it a
                     •
                  outheth the Pope to haue erred as Pope and publique person. Negatiuely, because it flatly denieth him to haue erred as a priuate person. But there is another point in this testimony, and that of great importance, which may not bée forgotten: I know not if you haue marked the same.

               It is a kind of Iugling and Legierdemaine, where with the Popes and their denoted vassals, haue seduced the world a long time: they alter and change their Romish faith and doctrine at their owne good will and pleasure, and to hide and couer the nakednesse of their Popes publike errors, & hereticall decrées; they cashéere and make away such former decrées of former Popes, as they cannot for shame approue, or by any honest meanes defend the same. For (as Alphonsus here telleth vs) this hereticall decrée and definition, which Celestine made, as Pope, and not as a priuate person, was in y• old decretall epistles, but this day cannot be found.
            
            
               Theoph.
               This point indeed I did not obserue, because Alphonsus saith he saw and read the same, but not that it is not this day to be found.

For first, though Cornelius, then Bishop of Rome, together with the whole national Synode of all the Bishopps of Italy had made a slat decrée touching rebaptization; and  secondly, though Pope Stephanus had confirmed the same decrée, and stricktly commanded it to be obserued: and  thirdly, though our Papists too much Iesuited and Italianized, doe of late daies obstinately affirme, (as appeareth by the notes of the Rhemists vpon the new Testament) that their Pope cannot erre, when hee defineth iudicially: yet this notwithstanding, S. Cyprian, both practically and iudicially giueth vs to vnderstand, that in his time the Bishop of Rome had no such priuiledge, as he this day arrogantly & Antichristianly taketh vpon him: for we▪ 
                  Cyprian stoutly and resolutely withstood the decrée of▪ Pope tephanus, who at that time was the Bishop of Rome: yea, he both sharply reproued him, and scornefully condemned his definitiue sentence and decrée.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I see not, how this proceeding of Saint Cyprian, can proue that the Pope may erre Iudicially in matters of faith: I beseech you take the paines to explicate the

same more at large.
            
            
               Remig.
               Saint Cyprian was euer reputed a learned man, and an holy Bishop in his life time, as also, a most glorious Martyr being dead. Now, in regard of his great learning, he could not haue béene ignorant of the Popes rare priuiledge in noterring in matters of faith; if either the holy Scriptures had taught it, or the learned Fathers of that age had beléeved or receiued it: and in regard ofThis fact of S. Cypriā, confoundeth the Pope. his piety and rare vertue, he would reuerently haue yéelded to such a singular prerogatiue, and haue giuen the glory to the sonne of God, the author thereof, if any such thing had béene done vnto him. Yea, if the Bishop of Rome had beene Christs Uicar generall, and so priuiledged, as our Iesuites and Iesuited crew beare the world in hand he is, that is to say that hée could not erre, in his iudiciall definitions of faith: then doubtlesse, S. Cyprian must needes haue béen a flat heretique, and so reputed and estéemed in the Church of God: For, if any Christian shall this day do, or affirme as S. Cyprian did, or publickly deny y• Popes sayd falsly pretéded prerogatiue of faith in any place, Country, territories or dominions, where Popery beareth the sway: then without all peraduenture, he must be burnt at a stake with fire and faggot for his paines.
            
            
               Theoph.
               God reward you for your trauaile: I see it nowOther Bishops were of Cyprians opinion. as cleerely as the noone day: For, S. Cyprian both knew the Scripture right well, and also what was the publike faith of the Church in his time: & so, if either the Scripture had taught it, or the Church had beleeued it; hee would neuer haue withstood it, but reuerently haue yeelded thereunto. But sir, our Doctors haue much to say for themselues, would God it might please you to heare, and answere the same at large.

               Obiection first.
               
                  Theophilus.
                  CHrist prayed for Peter, that his faith should neuer faile; ergo, the Bishop of Romes faith cannot faile nor the Pope erre in his iudiciall decrees: for, seeing Christ constituted a Church, which should continue to the worlds end; he prayed not onely for S. Peters person, butLuk. 22. v. 32. also for all that should succeede him in his Chaire at Rome.
               
               
                  Remig.
                  I answere;  first, that many learned Writers doubt greatly, not onely of his supposed Chaire, but euen of his being there. Howbeit, because all the holy Fathers,S. Peter suffred at Rome. and learned Writers of the auncient Church, doe with vniforme assent, affirme Saint Peter to haue béene Bishop of Rome, I willingly admit the same as a receiued truth.  Secondly, that albeit Christ prayed for S. Peters faith, as also appointed his Church to continue to the worlds end: yet doth it not follow thereupon, that what priuiledge soeuer he obtained by prayer for S. Peter, the same must redound to all those that lineally succéed in his place or chaire: for, no Scripture, no Councell, no Father doth so write, or so expound Christs prayer.  Thirdly, that Christ prayed for the faith of the whole Church, or for Peters faith, as he did represent the whole church, which is all one in effect: This I proue by sundry meanes. First,

because Christ himselfe doth so expound himselfe in theseIoh. 17. v. 9. 20. words; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast giuen mee, for they are thine. I pray not for these alone, but for them also, which shall beléeue in me through their word. Christ prayed aswell for the rest of his Apostles as hée did for Peter; and a well for all the elect, as for his Apostles: and consequently, séeing Christ directed not his words to Peter as to one priuate man, but as to one representing y• whole Church; it followeth of necessity, y• whatsoeuer Christ did, or said, concerning Peters faith, the same, perforce, must be vnderstood of the faith of y• whole Church, which faith shall neuer faile indeede Secondly, because Iohannes Gersonus, a famous PopishGers. vbi. sup. cap. 2. writer affirmeth constantly, as we haue seene already, that there is no infallible Iudge vpon earth in matters of faith, sauing the vniuersall Church, or a generall Councell lawfully assembled, and sufficiently representing the same, which doctrine, though procéeding from a Popish penne, I willingly embrace and reuerence as an vndoubted truth.  Thirdly, because S. Austen applieth Christs prayer generally & indifferently to all the whole Church.

or illation of Origen, is euident, euen by naturall reason: for, as that learned father profoundly disputeth, if Christ prayed not aswell for the rest as he did for Peter, of small credite were a great part of the holy scriptures: a reason doubtlesse, insoluble for all Iesuites and Iesuited popelings

Here I would haue you; M. Theophilus, to obserue seriously these points with mée, which if you shall doe, all partiality set a part, you cannot but abhorre and detest late start-vp popery: these are the obseruations.  First, that all which the Pope and his Iesuites can possible say on the Popes behalfe, why he cannot erre iudicially in matters of faith, is euen this and nothing else, that Christ prayed for S. Peters faith and his successors. Secondly, that not one doctor, two▪ or thrée, but Austen, Origen, Panormitane, together with all the great learned diuines of the vniuersity of Paris, doe with▪ vniforme consent and swéete harmony, expound Christs prayer to be made for the whole congregation of the faithfull.  Thirdly, that all the learned doctors of the said vniuersity are papists, and consequently, that they say or write nothing against the Pope, but what the zeale of truth vrgeth them vnto.  Fourthly, that all the learned diuines of Paris, (an vniuersity for learning and knowledge renowned throughout the Christian world,) doe this day as euer in former times, hold constantly, and both Christianly and zealously desend the same, viz: That the Bishops of Rome both may erre, and, de facto, haue erred in matters of faith, and that Christs prayer was onely for the whole Congregation of the faithfull.  Fiftly, that the said vniuersity was euer so farre from beléeuing this heresie that the Bishop of Rome cannot erre iudicially in matters of faith, as also from interpreting Christs prayer for any prerogatiue of his faith, or of his successors, that it publikely condemned Pope Iohns publike error in faith, and that with the

sound of the Trumpets, yea with the Kinges royall assent, and in his presence: their expresse words, and theCoram Philip.

They hold, that Saint Cyprian affirmeth resolutely, that false faith can haue no accesse to Saint Peters chaire, which if it be so, then cannot I perceiue how the Popes can erre in matters of faith: for you freely admit, that the Bishops of RomeCyprian. lib. 1. epist. 3. are Saint Peters successors there, & sit in his seate or chaire: and I like your dispute a great deale the better, because I see and finde you willing to discouer euery thing truly, & to conceale nothing that seemeth to make for their profession and religion.

Cyprian (as we haue heard) doth vtterly renounce that hereticall and damnable position; viz. that the Popes faith cannot faile: For, if S. Cyprian had beléeued that position, and withall had gainesaid and withstood the Popes definitiue and iudiciall sentence, hee should both in the iudgement of other holy Fathers, and in his owne conscience haue bin a flat Hereticke. But neuer did any holy Father, or y• Church of God so repute him. Pope Stephanus. with a Councel of al the Bishops and Priests of Italy, defined flatly against rebaptization: which decrée of Councel with the Popes assent thereto, Saint Cyprian scorned and contemned, stil defending his former opinion constantly. Yea, he was so farre from acknewledging y• prerogatiue in Popes, which they of latter dayes challenge to themselues, that he would not take Pope Stephanus for his superior, or to haue any iurisdiction ouer him, but termed him proud, ignorant, blinde, and naughty, as is euident to such as read his Epistle to Pompeius. Out of which procéedings, I note these memorable points

                         First, that he knew what the Pope and his Councel had decreed.  Secondly, that he iudged a Romish Councell to be of no greater force then a Councell African. Thirdly, that he iudged the councell of Italy to bee of no greater force for the Popes consent, then was the councell of Astricke, for his owne consent.  Fourthly, that prouinciall Councels are of no greater authority for the Popes confirmation, then for the confirmation of another Bishop.

                     Cardinall Bellarmine telleth vs that the Pope defined the controuersie indeede: but not as a matter of faith: and consequently, Saint Cyprian could not bee an Heretique, albeit hee withstood the decree of the Pope.

                           Bell knoweth Bellarmine right well. Cardinall Bellarmine? shall we make him another Pope? shall we admit euery thing hee saith, for and as, Christs holy Gospell? I knew the man right well before he was Cardinall, and I thinke no Angell hath spoken to him since. I fit so be, let him worke myracles for confirmation thereof. The Pope vtterly disliking Saint Cyprians opinion, and déeming it repugnant to Christs Gospell, did for that end conuocate all the cleargie men of Italy, that the controuersie might be derided, and the truth thereof made manifest to the world. And yet, saith Bellarmine, he defined it not as a matter of faith. The controuersie was about rebaptization, and consequently, either flatly with the Gospell, or flatly against the same. If it were flatly with the Gospell, then erred the Pope and his Councell egregiously: if it were flatly against y• Gospell, and the Pope so decréed it, then decréed he against it, as against a matter of faith, or else opinions and doctrinesMarke this point well. against the Gospell, are not against the Catholike faith: but the truth of the matter is this, viz. that if the Papists

graunt, (as of necessity they must graunt) S. Cyprian to haue withstood and contemned the Popes iudicial and definitiue sentence, & for all that, euer to haue béene reputed an holy▪ man and learned Father: it will fallow of necessity, that the Pope hath no such authority and prerogatiue as he a long time falsly hath vsurped, and still tyrannically pretendeth to haue. And therefore the Iesuited Cardinall▪ déemed it the best course for the continuance of his Popes falsly pretended prerogatines, to tell vs, that though the Pope defined the controuersie, yet did he not define it as a matter of faith, and so Saint Cyprian could he no hereticke, because hee withstood no decrée of faith, as if forsooth it rested in the Popes power to make matters of faith and herefie at his good will and pleasure.

                     This your answer doth yeeld great solace to to my heart: for our great masters beare vs in hand, that whatsoeuer the Pope decreeth, the same must we receiue and beleeue as an vndoubted truth, and their dayly practise is correspondent thereto: for whosoeuer shall denie or gainesay the Popes decree, (who is with vs as another God) shall vndoubtedly be burnt as a conuicted Heretike. Bellarmines answere, seemeth indeed to bee nothing else but a plaine tricke of Legerdemaine: as is his like conceite and doctrine, concerning his Popes double person. But good sir, doth not the Euangelist tell vs, that Christ built his church vpon Saint Peter? and that hell gates shall neuer preuaile against it: the words seeme very plaine. Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will IMat 16. ver. 18. build my church, and Hell gates shall not preuaile against it.

                  I answere, that Christ did not build his Church vpon Peter, I proue it. First because the words are changed, both in the Greeke, which is the fountaine ana originallAs in all assemblies of gouernment, one for order sake and peace must bed ssigned to end, and to moderate the actions, so was a preminence giuen to Peter among the Apostles that all things might be done in peace & order, a primacy, not of powers as ouer inferio

If Christ had meant to build his Church vpon Peter, he would haue said, (vpon this Peter) and not (vpon this Rocke:) And it is not to the purpose to say, that Christ spake in the Hebrew of Sy

Iohn, who being full of the holy Ghost would neuer, haue changed the words, but to insinuate & expresse a different sense and meaning if as: Christ had said▪ thou art a Rocke by name, and my selfe a Rocke by nature and indéede so strong, so permanent, & so inuincible, that hell gates cannot preuaile against it: Upon this Rocke therefore of thy consession, will I build my Church: against the faith of which Church, neither hell nor the Diuell shall euer preuaile. Secondly, because the Apostle affrmeth constantly, that no man can lay any other foundation then that which is laid, which is Iesus Christ: Christ therefore speaking in S Mathew of the Rock of the Church, doth by the word (Rocke) annotate himselfe, not S Peter: for we see that S Paul doth so expound Christs words, whose interpretation may fitly be gathered out of the circumstances of the text in S Mathew, either is it to the purpose, to cite out of the Re

Peter and of the others Apostles, to the gouernment of all the faithfull, other Apostles haue euen asmuch power as S Peter had; so that they could then excommunicate euery Christian in the whole world, and in euery Church make Bishops and Priests: the reason is, because all power promised and giuen to S.

                      First, that all the Apostles had as great authority, and as full and large euery way, as Saint Peter had.  Secondly, that euery Apostle, aswell as Peter, could make and constitute Bishops and Priests euery where, throughout the Christian world.  Thirdly, that what act soeuer S. Peter could doe, euery Apostle had power and authority to do the same.  Fourthly, that the iurisdiction of euery Apostle, was as great and as large euery way, as SaintMarke wel that all Writers teach this doctrine. 
                     Peters was. And this, (saith Couarruvias) is the common receiued doctrine of all Catholike writers: this is a poynt of Catholike doctrine so important and so memorable, as it well deserueth to be written in golden letters.  Fiftly, that Christs spéeches vnto Peter in the singular number, did not argue any superiority of iurisdiction, but only signifie the vnity of the Church.  Sixtly, that the authority and iurisdiction of euery Apostle was equal to Peters, and that without all difference of persons, place or consistory. This is another point of great consequence: for séeing, first, all and euery of the Apostles, had equal iurisdiction:Marke this well, for it striketh dead. séeing secondly, that their iurisdiction was not limited, but ouer the whole world: seeing thirdly, that the whole iurisdiction of euery Apostle, ended and expired with his death: and séeing fourthly, that S. Iohn liued after all the

So then, if the Bishop of Rome, will haue indéede any such prerogatiue, as he falsly pretendeth to haue, he must bring and shew vs his comission from S. Iohn, and not from S. Peter: for S Iohn being the suruiuer, had all iurisdictionLet this be well marked. in himselfe. And if the late Bishops of Rome, can shew vs such a commission from Saint Iohn, viz that Saint Iohn translated and committed his whole power, authority and iurisdiction to the Bishop of Rome, and his successors, I for my part, will willingly yeeld obedience

to the same, not otherwise. For I require the Popes charter from S. Iohn.

                  I told you that you are but bastards and deformed Catholikes, as your owne Capuchéenes do tell your deformed Franciscans: and withall I tell you that the Pope or Church of Rome (which is with Papists, all one) hath, de facto, erred egregiously as is already proued: Nay, it is vnpossible that ye Apostle should meane of your Pope or Church of Rome. I proue it many wayes. First because the famous Popish Doctor, Iohannes Gersonus, hath fréely told vs, (as we haue heard already related) ye
                     
the Bishop of Rome hath, de facto, erred, not onely in his priuate opinion but also in his publike and iudiciall definitions: & that therefore we haue no infallible Iudge vpon earth sauing these two. viz. the whole Congregation of the faithfull, and a generall Councell sufficiently representing the same: where I wish you to marke attentiuely, the word (Sufficiently) because it is very emphatical, 
                        •
                      of great moment.  Secondly, because the Popish Doctor Syluester Pryeras, a diuine so learned, that he is by them so named (Absolutus Theologus) confirmeth the opinion and doctrine of M. Gerson, the famous Chauncelor of Paris, in these expresse words; Et sic intellige glossam

Thirdly, because Panormitanus, that famous Popish Canonist, Abbot, Arch-bishop, & Cardinall, for he was all foure, and therefore of high estéeme with the Pope and Church of Rome, iumpeth with the other learned Papists, Gerson

And it skilleth not, if one say, that a Councell cannot erre, because Christ prayed for his Church, that it should not faile: for I say, that although a generall Councell represent the whole vniuersall Church: yet in truth, there is not truly the vniuersall Church, but representatiuely: For the vniuersall Church (which is it that

cannot erre) consisteth of the collection of all the faithful:Oh that this learned man durst haue spoken out. Whereupon all the faithful in the world, make this Church vniuersal, whereof Christ is the head. The Pope is the Uicar of Christ, but not truly the head of y• Church, as noteth the glosse vpon the Clementines, which glosse saith notably, that when the Pope is dead, the Church wanteth not an head, and this is that Church which cannot erre: whereupon it is possible, that the true faith of Christ might remaine in one alone, and so it may be truely said, that the faith faileth not in the Church. Christ before his passion prayed for Peter, that his faith should not faile: therefore the Church is not said to faile, neither to erre so long as the true faith abideth in one onely: thus writeth this famous and learned papist.

Secondly, that a generall councell may erre, because it is not the Catholike or vniuersall Church indéede. And here I thinke it very fit to reduce to your remembrance, what I told you afore out of M. Gerson, viz. that we haue only two Iudges vpon earth, which are infallible, that is, not the Pope forsooth, or the Church of Rome, but the whole congregation of the faithfull, and a generall councell: but what general councel? of Trent? of Lateran? of Florence? of Rauenna? of Ferrara? of Rome?

Gersons doctrine, is very emphatical, and giueth light both to the truth, and to Panormitans doctrine, which word, if it bee not well marked, there will séeme a variance betwéene the two learned Papists, Panormitan and Gerson: for the one of them saith, that a general councel may erre, and it is true: the other sayth that a generall councell cannot erre, but is the second infallible iudge vpon earth, and this is also true, but in a different respect: both the learned men agréeSee the antepast. 172. in this, and my selfe with them, that the whole congregation of the faithfull is that Church, which cannot erre in faith: for, though the elect may erre in part, and at some time, yet shall they neuer erre, either all generally,

or any one finally: for whom, and in respect of whom, the Church is rightly called the piller of truth: this is onely it, in which they vary; which is no true variance indéede, but séemeth so in shew of words: for that Councell whichMarke wel this point. sufficiently (marke the word) doth represent the whole congregation of the faithfull, (when and where such a one can be had,) may truely be called the Catholike Church militant here on earth.  Thirdly, that that ChurchThe body of Christ, which the wicked are not. Ephe. 2. v. 22 23. which cannot erre, is not the visible company of Bishops and Priests, Pastors, and Doctors; but the society of the predestinate, which are effectually called to the knowledge of the truth.  Fourtly, that it is the society and congregation of the faithfull, which the Apostle calleth the piller of truth: and neither the Pope, nor his Cardinals, nor yet the Church of Rome, albeit (M. Theophilus)1. Tim 3. 15 yée know it right well, that when the papists speake of the Church, and tell vs it cannot erre, then doe ye meane either your Pope alone, or the Pope with his Cardinals and others of that crew.  Fifthly, that the Popes owne deare Doctors haue told his holinesse roundly, that it is not the Pope that cannot erre, but the congregation of the faithfull: If any man should this day tell the Pope this tale, burning with fire and faggot would soone be his reward: howbeit, such their bookes are yet extant in many mens hands: for which benefit, Gods name be blessed,

                     I answere: first, by the Popes owne decrées indist. 42. cap. multi Sacerdotes. these expresse words: Multi Sacerdotes, & pauci Sacerdotes, multi in nomine, & pauci in opere. Videte ergo fratres, quomodo sedetis super cathedram, quia non cathedra facit Sacerdotem, sed Sacerdos cathedram. Non locus sanctificat hominem, sed homo sanctificat locum. Non omnis Sacerdos sanctus, sed omnis sanctus est Sacerdos, qui bene sederit super cathedrā, honorē accipit cathedrae, qui malè sederit, iniuriam facit cathedrae. Many Priests and few Priests, many in name, & few in worke: therfore my brethren, beware how you sit vpon the chaire: for not the chaire makes the Priest, but the Priest makes the

chaire: the place doth not sanctifie the man, but the man sanctifies the place: euery Priest is not a holy man, but euery holy man is a Priest: hee that shall sit well in the chaire, receiues the honor of the chaire: but he that sits euill doth iniury to the chaire. Thus saith the Popes own decrée. I ad nothing, I change nothing: I wil deale sincerely, vpon my saluation. Would to God the Pope and his Iesuited Popelings, did this day put this decréeThe faithful dealing of the Author. in practise Christianly. Let not the Popes henceforth, boast of sitting in Peters chaire. Let them remember that they be many in name, but few in worke: they haue not this hundred yeares, preached an hundred Sermons. What say I? an hundred Sermons? for so farre as I can learne not one at all: therefore as the Popes owne Canons tell vs, the Popes did honour Saint Peters chaire.  Secondly with Saint Austen, in these expresse words: sedendo Cathedram Moysi, legem Dei docent; ergo perAug. tract. 46. in Ioh, an▪ in medi

Thus write these two auncient and most learned fathers: by whose iudgements it is very cléere and euident, that the chaire of Moyses, and the doctrine of Moyses, is all one: and consequently,Marke this doctrine, and forget it not. that not they who occupy the roome of Moyses, or Peter, are to be followed, but they that teach the doctrine of Moyses and Peter are to be heard, and their commaundements

Fourthly, I answere with popish Fryer Lyra, (whom Sir ThomasLyr. in cap. 23. Mat. Moore called a great Clearke, & the Pope so estéemeth his writings,) in these expresse words: omnia quaecunque dix

Fifthly, with Dionysius Carthusianus, 
                        Carth in cap 23. Mat. in these very words: hoc est absolutê & vniuersaliter intelligendum, quia Scribae & Pharisaei multa superstitiosa & falsa docuerunt, corrumpentes scripturam, & irritum facientes verbum Dei per suas traditiones: intelligendum est ergo de Predicatoribus eorum, non contrarijs legi Moysimalis: enim Praesidētibus obediendū est, quādi

Thus write Lyranus and Carthusianus, two famous Popish Fryers, teaching the selfe saine doctrine, with the holy Fathers, Saint Austen and Saint Hylary: viz, y• we must beléeue those Preachers and teachers, that teach the same doctrine which Moyses thaught, & that y• is to fit in the chaire of Moyses, but not barely to occupy the place.

And because nothing is or can be of greater force against the papists then to confute their doctrine by the testimony of their owne approued Doctors, I will after my wonted manner, alledge the expresse words of approued papists, who were very deare vnto your Pope: Nicolaus Lyranus,
                        Lyr. in cap. 17 deuter. (who hath written very learned commentaries vpon the whole Bible, the old and new Testament,) a zealous popish Fryer, hath these words; hic dicit glos
                              •
                           a Hebraica, si dixerint tibi, quod dextra sit sinistra, vel sinistra dextra, talis sententia est tenenda; quod patet manifestè falsum, quia sententia nullius hominis cuiuscunque sit authoritatis, est tenenda, si contineat manifestatè falsitatem, vel errorem.Lo, papistry is confuted by Papists even of the best sort. Et hoc patet, period quod permittitur in textu Postea subditur, et docuerint te iuxta legem eius, ex quo patet, quod si dicant falsum, et declinent a lege Dei manifestè, non sunt audiendi. Here saith the Hebrew glosse, if they shall say to thée, that the right hand is the left, or the left hand the right, such sentence is to be holden, which thing appeareth manifestly false: for, no mans sentence, of how great authority soeuer he be, must be holden or obeied

It followeth in the Author; and they shall teach thée according to his law. Hereupon it is cléere; that if they teach falsly, and swarue from the law of God manifestly, then are they not to bée heard or followed. Thus writeth this learned Popish Doctor: out of whose words, well worthy to be engrauen in golden letters, I note these memorable obseruations.

Secondly, that Nicholaus de Lyra, a great learned Papist, (whose authority is a mighty argument against the Papists) doth here expresly condemne the grosse errour of the Hebrew Doctors, and in them the impudent errour of all Iesuites and Romish Paras

                        tes, who to satisūe the humour of their Pope, and to vphold his Antichristian tyranny, doe wrest the holy scripture from the manifest truth thereof. Thirdly, that we must neither beléeue Bishop nor the Pope of Rome, nor any mortall man of what authority soeuer, if he teach vs contrary to ye manifest truth of Gods word. Fourthly, that this learned Popish Doctor, doth gather out of the text it selfe, that the high Priest might erre, preach false doctrine, and consequently, that the Iesuite Bellarmine doth but flatter the Popes holinesse, when he bestirreth himselfe to proue out of this place, that the Bishops

                     I answere:  first, that the words in Deuteronomie doe plainely insinuate, or rather emphatically expresse a conditionall precept: for, in the ninth verse, the people are charged to aske councell of the Priests and Iudges, and in the tenth verse, the Priests are charged to teach according to Gods law: as if God had said, in allDeut. 17. v. 9. v. 10. thy difficult and distressed cases, thou shalt haue re

Secondly, that the Prophet Malachie is not repugnant to holy Moyses, but giueth his readers to vnderstand, that the Priests office is to knowe the lawe, and truely to teach the people the same: so as we may cléerely note a condition required at the Priests hand, but can finde no promise made vnto him, that he shall accomplishDeut. 17. v. 8. 9. 10. and performe the same: nay, it is euident many wayes, that the Priests had no promise made, that they should euer teach the lawe truely.  First, because the scripture telleth vs euery where, how grossely and shamefully the Priests haue erred: that which we haue heard already of the Scribes and Pharises, may be a sufficient testimomony and triall therof. Secondly, because the next words

following in the text, will make mine exposition good: these are the expresse words of the Prophet, but ye are gone out of the way, ye haue caused many to fall by theMal. 2. v. 8. Note this well. law, yée haue broken the couenant of Leui, saith the Lord of hostes. Marke these words well: so soone as the Prophet hath tolo vs, that the Priests lips shall kéepe knowledge, by and by he addeth but the Priests are gone out of the way, they haue scandalized many by the lawe, they haue broken the couenant of Leui: as if he had said, the Priests indéede should know the lawe, and teach the people the truth thereof, but they doe nothing lesse, they haue scandalized Gods people, they are gone out of theMal. 2. v. 8. way, they haue broken the couenant of Leui. Where we must note seriously, these words of the Prophet (but ye haue broken the couenant of Leui) for, in that he saith, ye haue broken the couenant, he plainely giueth vs to vnderstand, that the Priests had not performed the condition required at their hands, and implyed in the couenant of Leui. 
                         Thirdly, because the text in Deuteronomie, speaketh aswell of the politicall and ciuillDeut. 17. v. 9. 10. Deut. 10. 12. Exod. 28. 4 Iudge, as of the Priest, which Bellarmine your popish Cardinall cannot deny: and yet, that the ciuill Iudge may erre, all, both Iesuits and other Priests will confesse.  Fourtly, because in an other place of the law, the same promise that is here made to the Priests (which I calLeu. 26. 3. 25. Deut. 28. 1.

Where I note by the way, the falshood of the Latin vulgata editio: which the late popish Councell of Trent extolleth aboue the Gréeke and Hebrew:Deut. 17. v, 10, 11. Mal. 2. v, 7. for, in the Chapter next afore, the text saith thus: Vt iudicent populum, that they may iudge the people: but in the Chapter, which the papists cite for them, it is thus:

and they shall teach the people: and in the Prophet Malachie, thus: and the Priests lips shall kéepe knowledge: and yet in the Hebrew text (which is the fountaine and originall) the word (and) is in euery place: which the Papists guilefully change into the word (that) in the 16.Deut. 16. 18 Chapter: so to make their matter good, if it would or could be: but let (v

For, as it is sayd of the Priests y• they shall teach the truth, so is it sayd of y• ciuill Iudges & officers, that they shall iudge the people righteously: andThis point must be remembred. yet do their aduersaries grant that it is a condition in the ciuill Iudges, and no promise at all: and that therefore they may fayle in doing iustice, and swar

Though the papists conceiue no such thing, these are the expresse words: Iudices & Magistratus constitues, &c. vt iudicent populum iusto iudicio, nec in alteram partem declinent: Thou shalt make Iudges and Magistrates in all thy Cities which the Lord thy God giueth thée, throughout thy Tribes, and they shall Iudge the people with righteous iudgement, saith the Hebrew text: that they may iudge the people with righteous iudgement, and not decline into the other part, saith the popish Latin text: where euery child may discerne a condition implied, but no promise ofDeut, 17, 9 Mal. 2. 8. performing the same.  Fiftly, because as the Priests are said to teach the law, so are the people said to require the law of them: and consequently if it be a condition in the one, it is so in the other, and semblably if a promise in the one, a promise also in the other.

But if all persons haue erred, as you affirme,Ephes. 4. v. 14. then in vaine did God giue Pastors to his Church, to preserue his ▪people in the truth. For they that should haue taught the truth, did euen themselues swarue from the truth; and so they became vnfit instruments to do the will of God.

                     I answere:  first, that albeit Gods will be one, as himselfe is one, willing, by his owne essence, and byGods will is his essence. one eternall and immutable act whatsoeuer hee willeth; yet is his will said to be manifold, aswell of the holy Fathers, as of the Schoole-doctors: and this is done for two speciall considerations. The former is, by reason of the variety of the things which God willeth. The latter, for the variety of the manner by which God séemeth to will things. Here vpon arise many divisions of Gods will, assigned by the learned for explication sake. Some deuide Gods will into antecedent and consequent. Some others deuide it into the will of signe, and will of good pleasure. Others, into the will reuealed, and will secret or not reuealed. Others into the will absolute and will conditionate, and the like. Secondly, that though Gods will consequent, and will of good pleasure, be euer accomplished

vndoubtedly; yet is his will antecedent, and will of signe, oftentimes neglected and left vndone. Of the former will, ye Prophet speaketh thus: Whatsoeuer pleased the Lord, that did he in heauen, and in earth, in the SeaPsa. 46 80. Ps. 155. 6. Rom. 9. 19. and in all the depths. And the Apostle sayth: For who hath resisted his will? Of the latter we haue many examples in the holy Scriptures: God commanded Pharao to let his people go, but Pharao would not obey. God wouldExo. 4. 22. 23 Mat. 23 v. 37. haue gathered the Iewes together, euen as the Hen gathereth her Chickens vnder her wings, but they would not haue it so. God would haue all men saued, as the holy Apostle witnesseth; and yet we know by the holy Gospell, that the greater part shall be damned. Thirdly, that Gods will now obiected, is onely Voluntas signi (his1 Tim. 2. v. 4. Mat. 20. v. 16. will of signe) and not voluntas beneplaciti (his will of good pleasure) and therefore it can neuer bee effectually concluded out of this Scripture, that the Pastors of the visible Church doe alwaies teach the truth, and neuer swarue from the same: for the Apostle speaketh indefinitely, and indifferently of all Teachers, and of all hearers, of all shepheards and of all shéepe, neither excepting one nor other; and yet both you know, and I know, that many Preachers preach false doctrine, and that many hearers embrace the same: whereupon it followeth of necessity, that if the Apostle should meane as you would haue him to meane; then should Christs intent and purpose bée frustrate in very déed, which for all that, is it that your selues impugne.

                         from being impossible, that I am able to effect it with all facility. Aaron was the high Priest in the law, and yet erred he most grosly and egregiously, while he taught the people flat Idolatry, telling them that the molten Calues brought them out of the Land of Egypt.

                        Aaron indeed consented to Idolatry, and made the molten Calfe, but the text saith not, that hee taught Idolatry.

                     This is Cosen-german to y• of the Popes double person. Yée haue heard of a Bishop of Rome, that sayd right learnedly; that he that can hinder sinne and doth it not, is as much in fault as he that doth it. Tullie that heathen Orator, knew the same euen by the sole light of nature. This being so, which the Apostle confirmeth to béeRom. 132 Vertually, though not vocally, true; it followeth by a necessary consequence, that Aaron was guilty of the Idolatry committed: and albeit the text say not that he taught Idolatry vocally: yet doth it plainly insinuate, or rather fully expresse that he did it vertually and effectually. For,  first, when the people required him to make them Gods, he did not reproue them, butExod. 32, v 1, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6,

Againe, the people sayd openly, these be thy Gods, O Israel, which brought thée out of the land of Egypt: and yet Aaron was so farre from preaching against that hereticall assertion, that thereupon he built an Altar before the Calfe, and proclaimed, saying, to morrow shall be the holy day of the Lord: as if he had sayd, your doctrine is my doctrine, your faith, my faith, your opinion mine opinion: I practically shew it in building this Altar before the Calfe, and in proclaiming to morrow to bée

holyday.  Thirdly, the text saith plainely that Aaron made the people naked, and consequently, that he erred in his doctrine.  Fourthly, because not the high Priest onely, but all the Priests of the Consistory at Hierusalem,Deut. 17.

Lastly, (and this reason striketh dead) because Caiphas the high Priest erred perniciously and taught most execrable blasphemy, when heMat. 26. v▪ 64. 65. denied Christ to be the sonne of God. A true Messias of the world: for as soone as Christ had sayd (hereafter shall yée sée the sonne of man sitting on the right hand of theThe high Priest, erred most grosly. power of God, and come in the cloudes of heauen) The high Priest rent his cloathes, saying hée hath blasphemed, what haue we any more néed of witnesses? behold, now yée haue heard his blasphemy.

                     I am fully satisfied in this point. God, (for whose sake ye haue taken this great labour) giue you reward for the same.

                     My first question is, of the succession of the Popes of Rome: for no Church is able truly to shewe their succession, (as the Pope, his Cardinals, and Iesuites tell vs) saue onely the Church of Rome.

                     I hope in God (though indéed it be not a thing easily done) to make it as plaine to you, as I haue done the other question, or rather God in me, that our English Church can shew a better succession, then can the Church of Rome.

               Theophilus.
               NO Church in the vniuersall world is able to shew a perpetuall succession of her Bishops, without interruption, saue onely the Church of Rome: and therefore, seeing God hath appointed & placed in his visible ChurchEphes. 4. v.

               Remig.
               This indéed is a reason so strong in the iudgement of Papists, that none liuing can truly answere the same. Howbeit when the difficulty thereof shall bée truly examined to the bottome, it will be found of no force at all, but as light as a feather.

               I am very willing to grant euery truth: neither will I deny that there haue béene, are, and shall bée Bishops and Priests, or Pastors and teachers, in this visible Church militant on earth, vntill Christs second aduent, and generall doome of the world.
            
            
               Theoph.
               Well, there must be Bishops and Priests, or Pastors and Teachers, (as the Apostle termeth them) euen to the consummation of Saints, and end of the world. Now sir, you are not able (say our Doctors, our Iesuits, our Cardinals, our Popes) to shew or name any Church in the world, but the Church of Rome, which hath alwaies had in it these Pastors and Doctors from Christs visible departure to this day.
            
            
               
               Remig.
               I answere, that succession is of two sorts, to wit, materiall and formall. Materiall is of the persons and the places: formal of the faith and doctrine. Touching the succession formal (which is the principall, and from whence the denomination must bée deriued) the Church of Rome cannot chalenge it, as it is already proued: for,The Church of Rome wan▪ teth formal succession. (if yée remember) I haue proued both soundly and plainly, that many Bishops of Rome, haue taught false doctrine, and that not onely as priuate men, but euen as publike persons in their iudiciall definitions and decrées: and consequently that the true, proper, and formall succession, can no way bée truly verified of the Church of Rome.
            
            
               Theoph.
               That is very true, which yee now say: it cannot bee denyed, but still it seemeth true that the materiall succession perteineth onely to the Church of Rome.

               This variety among Catholicke Writers is strange; and it is more strange, that Clement should alter and change S. Peters constitution. But it surpasses all the rest, that any thing which S. Peter ordeined, could bee pernicious to the Church.

Out of which discourse▪ two things of great moment are to bée obserued. First, that it is a méere foolery to chalenge any singular prerogatiue, by Saint Peters death at Rome. Againe, that that succession cannot but bée vncertaine; which is deriued from thrée Bishops, striuing and grinning for the Popedome, as dogges do for a bone.

               Two no small absurdities doe perforce arise from hence. The one, that the succession of the Popes of Rome (whereof they glory somuch) is very doubtfull and vncertaine.

               If it were possible for a woman, to bee inthronized into Peters chaire at Rome: then as you say, popish succession were ouerthrowne indeede, it cannot be gainsaid. But such a thing neither hath beene, neither is, neither euer can be till the worlds end.

               I answere:  first, that these eight Historiographers, liued longer one after another, then Sigebertus Geniblasensis and Marianus Scotus liued after Pope Iohn. 
                   Secondly, that all Historiographers, write for the most part, by the report of others.  Thirdly, that so many writers, Pope Iohn was a woman. otherwise of good credit with your Pope, may well be credited of vs in a matter against your Pope; especially since sundry of them be your owne holy popish Fryers. Fourthly, that this story of Pope Iohn, is publikely painted, and is this day to bée séene in your Cathedrall Church of Syenna: which painting, our politike newly hatched Iesuites, sought earnestly to haue had it defaced, in the late repairing of that Church; but the Bishop of ye place,Exod 8, 19. (digitus Dei est hic) would not suffer them to preuaile. 
                     Digitus Dei est hic. The truth must preuaile in time. 
                   Fifthly, that these eight writers, who were all the Popes owne vassals, and liued long one after another, would neuer for shame haue published one and the selfe same story to the world if any one of them could in his life time haue learned the centrary to be the truth.
            
            
               Theoph.
               They say onely and barely (vt ferunt) as the report and fame goes: and other graue writers that liued before them all, and neerer the time of Pope Iohn, make no mention thereof at all.
            
            
               Remig.
               I answere:  first, that an argument, ab authoritate, negatiué, is not holden good in your Schooles; and yourselues do roundly condemne in others that manner of dispute.  Secondly, that if these famous writers had not béene fully perswaded of the truth of the story, they

would neuer haue published it to the world: and hereof this double reason may be yéelded. First, for that the Popes déere friends, were, no doubt, very loathto reueale the shame and turpitude of their holy fathers, saue onely then and so much, when and how much the very force of truth compelled them to do. Againe, because they being very learned, could not be ignorant, that it was a great damnable sinne to defame so great a man.  Thirdly, that the sayd Authors write of this matter, euen as they do of other things. Palmerius and Sigibertus, both haue thesePalmer. & Sigeber. in Chron. expresse words: Fama est, hunc Iohannem faeminam fuis
                        •
                     e, & vnisoli familiari tantum cognitam, qui eam complexus est, & grauis facta, peperit Papa, existens: quare, eam inter Pontifices non numerant quidam: The fame goes, that this Iohn was a woman, and not knowne but to her familiar friend; by whose familiarity she became with child,Obraue succession of women Popes. and was deliuered euen whiles she was Pope: for which respect, some do not reckon her among the Popes. Marianus, Polonus, Bergomensis, Platina, and Carranza, (whom I haue already named) teach flatly and plainely the selfe same doctrine, writing vpon the same woman Pope: and here must I put you in minde of this mackeable poynt, viz. that Marianus Scotus, affirmeth the story constantly, flatly, and simply, without all ands or iffs.The Popes of Rome 4. can beare children but not preach. Yea, Martinus Polonus, the Popes owne Penitentiary, singeth the selfe same song. Fourthly, that some Historiographers, fauouring the Pope more then the truth, haue of purpose (so to couer the Popes shame) concealed the truth of the story. To these I may fitly adde that which their famous Abbot saith; the beast (saith my L. Abbot Bernardus,

               This is wonderfull which you say, and I hope

I may giue credit to your reports, your protestation hath assured me thereof: howbeit for my further satisfaction, let me tel you that one of your authors Nauclerus, by name, vtterly denieth the story, as I haue heard.

               I make a conscience, (I thanke my Lord God humbly for it) to deale sincerely in all my writings, andThe Authors protestation for his sincere dealing. with you in this our Christian conference, wishing heartly, that the papists would doe the like: I haue euer dealt so truely and vprightly against the papists in all my writings, as I now in my old and decrepite age, I am ready to take it vpon my saluation, and to seale the truth thereof with my blood. Concerning your report of Nauclerus, you shall truely heare his owne words and that done, yéeld your censure according to the truth: after that this Nauclerus had told a long tale in the fauour of our Woman-Pope, (so to couer and hide the nakednesse of his holinesse) at the length he resolueth with himselfe, and concludeth the controuersie in these expresse words: Sed etsi fuit verum, nulli tamen, ex hoc, salutis eme

               Theoph.
               I will confesse the truth: I obserue out of this testimony of our reuerend and learned histriographer, these memorable points of doctrine. First that Nauclerus hath emploied his whole industry, and all his wits, to defend the Pope from shame and dishonour, if it possibly could be done.  Secondly, that Antoninus their reuerend Archbishop and canonized Saint, is of his opinion.  Thirdly, that Christ is the head of the Church, and that therefore the Church wanted not a head in time of the woman Pope, if euer there were such a monster in the world.  Fourthly, that popish succession is as vncertaine as the weather-cocke, howsoeuer my selfe and others, haue hitherto beene seduced therewith: and I humbly thank my Lord God, that by your most Christian instruction, (as by an instrument appointed by him for that end) I nowe at the last behold the same.

Two further points of great consequence, are implied in the doctrine of Nauclerus: 
                   the one that it is this day doubtfull, which of their romish Cardinals and Bishops be rightly ordered, and whether they be meere Lay-men, or Priests:  the other, that the Cardinals, popish Priests, and lay people of

Rome, did for many yéeres commit flat idolatry.
            
            
               Theoph.
               These points could I neuer haue considered in his doctrine, God reward your paines emploied for his sake▪ but what? are not the Cardinals and Priests in the Church of Rome, truely and lawfully consecrated in their functions?
            
            
               Remig.
               I speake not generally and absolutely, of the consecration of the Cardinals, Bishops, and Priests in the Church of Rome, fit occasion will be offered hereafter, to speake more precisely of that point of doctrine: the question is now, of those particular Cardinals, Bishops and Priests, who were consecrated for such, in the time of the Woman-pope Iohn, for as the Popes owne deare Doctor Nauclerus telleth vs, all such as were ordered by the Woman-pope, were to be ordered again, as being but méere Lay-men.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I am at my wits end, what to say or thinke of the Church or Pope of Rome.
            
            
               Remig.
               What? I am sure you remember the old receiued Maxime; (Vbi Papa, ibi Roma; vbi Roma, ibi Ecclesia Catholica) where the Pope is, there is Rome; and where Rome is, there is the Catholike Church. So, as, the Pope is Rome, the Catholike Church, Christ himselfe and all.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I cannot indeed but remember the same, it is so frequent and vsual in euery learned Papists mouth. But alas alas, the remembrāce thereof, doth this day wound me at the very heart: for hitherto I haue beene taught to hold it for a constant truth, that the Catholike Church, the Church of Rome, and the Popes holinesse, were all as one, that is to say, that the Popes faith, was the faith of the Church of Rome, and the faith of the Church of Rome, the faith of the Catholike Church militant heere on earth.
            
            
               Remig.
               It is very true which you say, and this approued

Romish Maxime confirmeth the same: for when the Pope and his Popelings tell vs, that the Church cannot erre, then do they meane that the Pope cannot erre: and when they speake of the Catholike Church, then they euerMark this. The Church cannot erre, that is the Pope cannot erre. 1489. meane of y• Church of Rome & of such Churches as iump in faith with the Pope. So then we must iump with the Collier, and say we beléeue as the Church beléeueth, and the Church beléeueth as we beléeue: for, by this learned answere, (if Cardinall Hosius writ truly) we may ouercome the diuell; but when all is said & done, we must beléeue, we cannot indéed tell what: for when y• Pope saith thus and thus you must beléeue, if then he speake as a priuate man, my faith is wan, and no faith indéed: for as a priuate man he may erre, and so both deceiue himselfe and me, as we haue séene already: and yet (alas for pitty) these two articles I must hold for an vndoubted truth, which agrée together as Yorke and soule Sutton. First, that the Pope may erre, and become an heretike. Secondly, that I am an Hereticke, vnlesse I beléeue as he teacheth me, if he speake as a publike person. This notwithstanding, I may not, to dye for it, examine the Popes decrées, whether they procéed from him, as hée isVictor. de potest Pap

               It is cléere out of Nauclerus that the Cardinals, popish Bishops, Priests, and Lay-people of Rome, committed

Thus you shall vnderstand the same Nauclerus telleth vs plainely, that their woman-pope could neither make Priests, nor yet consecrate their Eucharist. To this doctrine, let vs adde these points.  First, that all Papists must adore their Bread-god in euery popish Masse.  Secondly that by popish faith, none but popish Priests can turne bread into Christs body.  Thirdly, y• all Priests made by their woman-pope were méere Lay-men. This foundation thus firmely layd▪ we may erect without dangerThis woman-pope, liued A. D. 18. of falling, this high and lofty building, viz that all y• Cardinals, Bishops, Prists, and Lay-people, who euer heard the Masses of their women-pope, or of the Bishops and Priests made by her, did commit flat Idolatry at every one of the sayd Masses: the reason is euident, because such Priests were indéed méere Lay-men, and so could not change the bread and make it God almighty: and consequently the spectators and adorers that were present, adored bakers bread for the euer-liuing God. All this is sound Popish faith and doctrine.

I returne this answere to them both, viz. that this distinction of ignorance, inuented in Popish

Schooles, hath no foundation in Gods word, neither yet, in the pure Cannens of the Popes law. For the former, the Prophet Ezechiel, (or rather God by the meuth of Ezechiel) telleth vs plainely and in flat termes, that though the watch-man giue not y• people warning, but suffer them to liue in ignorance, yet shall they be guilty, and perish in their sinues. Yea, Christ himselfe telleth vs, that who knoweth the law and doth it not, shallEzec. 3. 18. & cap. 33. v. 8. Psal. 79. v. 6 Luk. 12. 48. Caus. 17. q. 4 cap. siquis.

There yet remaineth a mortall and vncureable wound in Popish Succession at Rome; which I hold very necessary for you to know, for your better confirmation in the truth.

               The incurable wound, may be reputed the second wonderment of the world: this is it, marke it well. The general Councell of Basil, deposed Pope Eugenius for his contumacie, and chose Amadaeus (who was named Foelix the first) and put him in his roome: this, notwithstanding, Eugenius crept againe into the Popedome

without any Canonicall election, and continued in the place as Pope.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I do not well conceiue or vnderstand, what you would inferre hereupon. I therefore humbly craue your larger explication thereof.
            
            
               Remig.
               The Councell of Basil was holden in Anno, 1439. and summoned Eugenius to appeare before it, thenA. D. 1439. and there to yéeld an account of such matters as the Councell had to obiect against him, but he would not appeare:Loe, the Councell deposed the Pope for his disobedience. and therefore for his contuinacie, disobedience, & contempt of the Councels summons, he was by the authority of the sayd Councell deposed, and Amadaeus was made the Pope or Bishop of Rome. The Schisme betwéene Amadaeus and Eugenius continued about nine yeares, vntill Foelix was content to resigne to Nicholas, and then it ended. Now sir, all y• Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, & Deacons, who afterward sprong of Eugenius (possessing Peters chaire without Canonicall election) that is, of the Church of Rome, are illegitimate, irregular, schismatikes, vsurpers and not lawfull gouerners of the Church by popish faith and doctrine.

               One refuge the Papists would seeme to haue herein, viz. that the counsell could not depose the Pope: which if it once be proued against them, their backs are at the wall, and their Popish Romish succession.

               It is without all question, that a general Councell was and is aboue the Pope: no learned papist euer did, or this day doth deny the same, the Popes themselues, the Iesuits, and Iesuited crew onely excepted.

                   the Deuines of Paris and all others, (except euer before excepted,) doe resolutely and constantly defend as an vndoubted truth grounded vpon the holy scriptures, that

a generall Councell is aboue the Pope: the practicall procéedings of papists euery where, haue yéelded vs an assured argument thereof: for first, the Councell of Basil (as we haue séene) deposed Pope Eugemus, and chose Amadaeus in his roome. Secondly, the generall Councell of Constance, (which was celebrated about 15. yéeres before the Councell of Basill) did publikely depose thrée Popes (Iohn, 22. Gregory, 12. and Benedict, 13.) and those Martin the fifth, and made him Pope: which things doubtlesse, these Councels hauing many very learned men in them, would neuer haue attempted so publikely and so resolutely as they did, if it had not béene a resolued and knowen case and truth, throughout the Christian world.
            
            
               Theoph.
               The case is cleere and euident to euery indifferent reader: but giue me leaue I pray you, to tell what the papists say to this, the Councell of Basil (say they) was not a lawfull Synode, because it had neither the presence of the Pope, nor of his Legats.

For first, the Councel was called by Pope Martin the fifth to be holden at Papias, from whence by reason of the pest it was remoued to Senas, afterward it was translated by Alphonsus the King of Aragon, and continued at Basill, where were present both Sigismundus the Emperour, and Iulianus the Popes owne Legat, and after him Ludouicus the Cardinall of Arles supplied his place. Again, not onely the Councell of Basil, but the Councels also of Constance, of Florence, and of Lateran, did all constantly

and vniformely define for an vndoubted truth, that aA generall Councell is aboue the Pope, by the verdict of best learned papists. generall Councell is aboue the Pope, and hath authority to cite him, to controll him, and to depose him: for due proofe and triall whereof, the Councell of Constance deposed, de facto, thrée Popes, viz. Iohn 23. Gregory 12. and Benedict 13. and chose Martin the first, and made him Pope in his place.

               Amongst the Popes excommunications the 29. is against the Colledge of Cardinals in the Romish Church, who by Symonie or Symoniacall pacts, procure themselues to bee aduanced to the Popedome. By verture of which excommunication, all such as are made Popes by Symony & Symoniacall pacts, doe, ipso facto, incurre the sentence of excommunication, from which they can neuer be absolued, but by one that is Pope indéed,Barth fumus A. D 1503. and Canonically elected thereunto. Upon which excommunication, one of the Popes inquisitors, Bartholomaeus Fumus, a very learned Dominican Fryer, hath published this commentary, for the true sense & meaning

of that extrauagant, which Pope Iulius the second diuulged in that behalfe: these are his expresse words: Nota hic & bene, Papa Simoniacé electus non est ve

               I see euidently by the Popes own constitution, and flat decree, (as by the law of the Medes and Persians) which no papist may withstand or gainsay, that whosoeuer is chosen Pope by Simony, is no Pope indeede.

               The 18. excommunication falleth vpon all those which deny the Church of Rome to be the head of all other Churches, and the Pope to be the commaunder of all people: this excommunication was thundred out, for the establishing of the Popes tyranny throughout the

Christian world: ye 21. excōmunication is against all such as shall boldly affirme either that the blessed Virgin Mary was conceiued in originall sinne, or not so conceiued: and shall thereupon condemne them of heresie, or of mortall sinne, that hold, preach, or defend the contrary: this excommunication Pope Sixtus the fourth thundred out in his Extrauagant, in the yéere 1474. by which practicallA. D. 1474. procéedings and doctrine, we may easily espie the vncertainety of the Popes faith and religion, as also his ignorance, in the high mysteries of popish doctrine: for, though he cannot erre iudicially in matters of doctrine, as the papists must beléeue, yet can he not decide this easie question, whether the Virgin Mary was conceiued in originall sinne, or not: but Aquinas the Popes angelicall doctor and canonized Saint, (whose doctrine two Popes, Vrbanus the fourth, and Innocentius the fifth, haue confirmeth to be sound and true▪) affirmeth resolutely, that she was conceiued in originall sinne: tell me now, what ye thinke of the Popes succession at Rome?
            
            
               Theoph.
               I see flatly and euidently, that by popish doctrine, faith, and religion, we cannot this day tell, who are true Bishops of Rome indeed: and consequently, that the succession deriued from them, is of no credit or force at all: but yet by your fauour, I desire your further resolution to such shewes and colours of succession, as they pretend for the Church of Rome. Saint Austen saith, (say they)Aug. contr. ep. fund. that the succession of Priests euen from Saint Peter to these daies, kept him in the bosome of the Church: so Optatus, Tertullianus, & others, do often alledge, & stand vpon the succession of Bishops, as an argument of the truth.
            
            
               Remig.
               It is true, that Saint Austen made a great account of the succession of Bishops in the Church of Rome, and my selfe (also all learned men I thinke,) doe iumpe with Saint Austen in that his opinion: for the resolution of which obiection, sundry obseruations already

Proued are to be well remembred.  First, that the Bishops of Rome were in the beginning, many of them holy Martyre, who gaue their liues for the testimony of our Lord Iesus.  Secondly, that they ioyned formall succession with materiall, vntill Saint Austens dayes and long after.  Thirdly, that the Church of Rome by little and little swarued from the truth, and declined in many points of doctrine from the auncient receiued faith.  Fourthly, Mark

Fifthly, that faith and honest dealing was now decaied in the Church of Rome, and long before the daies of Carranza and Platina brought to that miserable estate, that euery ambitious fellow might inuade Peters seate.  Sixthly, that by popish doctrine and vniforme assertions of best approued popish writers, succession in the Church of Rome is so doubtfull, that they cannot proue themselues this day to be true Bishops indeed: I say (by popish doctrine) because my selfe doe hold them true Bishops, though very wicked and vngodlyThe old Bishops of Rome, ioined formal succession with materiall. men: of which point I shall haue occasion, to speake of more at large by and by: my answere therefore in briefe is this: viz, that the Bishops of Rome in Saint Austens time, ioyned formall succession with materiall, which if the Bishops of Rome would this day performe, all godly Christians would now ioyne with them, as Saint Austen did in his time: for as Saint frene say, we ought to obeyIrenaeus. lib.

               Saint Paul saith plainely, that there must bee

Bishops and Pastors in the church vntill the worlds end: whereupon it followeth (say the Papists, whom now I haue vpon good grounds renounced) that you Protestants haue no Church at all: for before Luther departed from them, all Bishops and Priests for many yeares together, embraced their Romish religion. This obiection (say our Iesuites and Iesuited Popelings) doth so gall the Protestants, as they cannot tell in the world, what answere to frame thereunto.

               The Iesuites say that howsoeuer you wrangle about your formal succession, yet it is cleere that you haue

no material succession at all, vnlesse you tearme it material succession, when meere Lay-men occupy the roomes of lawful Bishops: for none may take vpon them, or intrude thēselues into the holy ministery, but such as are lawfully called thereunto, as Aaron was: & yet all the world can tellHebr. 5. 4. you, that all your Ministers, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, in the time of King Edward, and Queene Elizabeth, and now of King IAMES, haue no other orders & consecration at all, but such as they receiued of our Romish Bishops indeede.

               Our succession is both materiall and formall, Christian and Apostolicall: as which is consonant to the holy Scriptures, and to the vsuall practise of the primitiue Church.  For first, our Bishops can proue their Doctrine by the scriptures, and by the testimonies of best approued popish writers, as we haue séene already.  Secondly, our Bishops haue mission and imposition of hands, according to the practise Apostolical▪ and of all approued antiquity.  Thirdly, our Bishops are made in such forme and order, as they haue euer béene accustomed, a few popish, superstious, and beggerly ceremonies omitted, which by little & little▪ had of late yeares crept into the Church, that is to say, by frée election of the Chapiter, by consecration of the Arch-bishop, and other his associates, and by the admission of the Prince.

               Theoph.
               Out of this doctrine of this famous papists, I gather to the confusion of the late Bishops of Rome, their Iesuits, and all Iesuited papists, these three euidents, golden,

and most necessary corollaries. First, that the vulgar and common sort of people are grosly deceiued, when they terme popery the old religion, and repute them for the auncient Catholikes: for, we are indeede the true andCorollari

I adde as consectary hereunto, that as in ciuill causes many are debarred from their lawfull inheritance, through the violent dealing of mighty men, euen so we, the true reformed Catholikes, haue beene many yeeres excluded from the free vse of our owne Church and Sacraments, by the force, violence, and tyrannie, of the blood-thirsty Romish Bishops, and partly by remissenes of sundry Emperours, who vpon a blind zeale not grounded vpon Gods word, yeelded vp their soueraigne rights vnto them: and as temporal men are in time restored to their auncient right, by zealous and godly Magistrates: euen so were we and are we (God make vs thankefull for it) by the goodnesse of God and most Christian Princes, (King Henry the eight, King Edward the sixt, Queene Elizabeth, and King IAMES our most gratious soueraigne now happily regnant ouer vs) restored to the old Christian, Catholike, and Apostolike religion, and with all Christian freedome placed again in our owne Churches, the spirituall birth-right of our selues and our ancestors.

Secondly, thath our Bishops in England are made andCorollary. 2. consecrated, according to the auncient, Christian, Catholike, Apostolike, and old Roman maner, that is to say,Corollary. 3 by the letters Patents of the Prince. Thirdly, that the Emperours of Constantinople, for the space of 200. yeares and odde after the dissolution of the Empire in the west, had still the soueraignty ouer the Bishop of Rome: for the west Empire was dissolued in Anno 471, and Benedict the second obteined of the Emperour Constantine in Anno 684, that the Bishops of Rome might from thenceforth be chosen, confirmed, and enioy their iurisdiction, without the commandement and letters Patents of the Emperour.

               You haue marked well the discourse, and for all that, haue not obserued one point of great consequence.
            
            
               Theophilus.
               What is that I beseech you heartily?

               The late Popes or Bishops of Rome, tel vs, that Constantine the great, at his departure from Rome to Constantinople, gaue the Bishop of Rome and his successors his crowne and all his royall dignitie, both in the Citie of Rome, and in Italie, and in all the west parts:Dist. 96.

               Remig.
               This is a point of great consequence, which I should neuer haue espied, but by your relation.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I would wish you likewise to obserue, that the Emperours, Constantinus, Iustinianus, and others, yéelding vp their soueraigne rights to the Bishops of

Rome vpon a fond zeale without knowledge, opened the window to all antichristian tyrannie: for in short time after, the Romish Bishops became so arrogant and Lordly, that they tooke vpon them to dispose Royall scepters, and to translate them to their pleasures.
            
            
               Theoph.
               It is a memorable obseruation, I shall keep it in remembrance: but let me still reason for the Papists, as if I were one of them; for when all difficulties are answered, I shall be the stronger in the truth. The Church of God cannot be without Bishops and Priests, as the ApostleEphe. 4. 11. recordeth, and your selfe graunteth: but so it is, that when he first reformed the Church, as you terme it, yee neither had any Bishops, nor any Priests of your owne, neither could ye finde any in any other place, but onely with vs and in our Church, when Martin Luther went out from vs: our Church therefore and none but ours, is the true Church of God; as which onely hath the true succession Apostolicall.
            
            
               Remig.
               I answere first, that our succession in the Church of England, is farre better then theirs of Rome: for theirs of Rome, (as we haue heard and séene) is most doubtfull and vncertain: but ours of England so constant and so assured, as no deniall can be made thereof: I proue it, because in Anno, 596. Gregory the greatA. D. 596. sent Augustine the Monke, with Iustus, Melitus, and others (as our approued Cronicles do relate) to preach the Gospell to the Saxons, who were kindly receiued of King Ethelbert: and he conuerted to the Christian faith, gaue to the same Austen the City of Canterbury: since which time our Church of England is able to proue her perpetuall succession of Bishops, without schisme or interruption at all, albeit ye Church of Rome (as is already proued) is not able to performe hal

Christian reformation: yet for all that, the Bishops and Priests of the popish Churches were still true Bishops for their calling, albeit otherwise very wicked men, and consequently, that our Bishops and Priests though descended, created, and made of such deformed popish Prelats, are true Bishops and Prists indéede.
            
            
               Theoph.
               If our Bishops and Priests were made of theirs, then must either theirs bee good, or ours as bad as theirs: and so we shall haue no true Bishops at all.

                  stantly, there remained in them some life of Christianity. They wanted legges, and armes, and had their bodies and soules corrupted with many pestilent diseases; but they did still draw breath, and were not wholy dead. We read in the Apostolicall history, that there were some that beléeued, who being of the heresie of the Pharisées, did still hold the ceremonies of the law, and vrged others to be circumcised. The Prophet Dauid was sore wounded with adultery and murther; but yet he still continued

               How can they be both good and bad Bishops at once? it seemeth to me a thing impossible.
            
            
               Remig.
               I answere: first, that the same persons may aswell be both good and bad at once, as the same man may be both a father and a sonne at once: and yet do all Logicians grant, that this latter may be effected with all facility. For, one and the same man, may at one and the same time, be both a father in respect of his own child, & a sonne in respect of his father, who is Grandfather to the saydRelatiua a

               Theoph.
               Those Popish Bishops that made and created our Bishops and Priests, in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths reigne, ordeyned and consecrated them after another manner, then they are this day, and euer haue beene since that time, ergo, either must their Bishops, or else all our Bishops, the first onely excepted (who were created after the popish manner) be false, counterfeit, and no true Bishops indeed.
            
            
               Remig.
               Neither their Bishops, nor ours, are false and conterfeit, but both true and perfect Bishops, in euery essentiall and necessary poynt pertaining to a Bishop.

Secondly, that the famous generall Councell of Constantinople (which was celebrated in Anno 681.) granted the Bishope of Constantinople equall priuiledges with the Bishop of Rome, and to excell in all Ecclesiasticall affaires as the Bishop of Rome; saue onely that the chief Patriarchall seat was reserued to him for order-sake and peaceable gouernement of the Church. For as Rome was the chiefe seate of the Emperour, and therefore called Caput mundi; so was ye Bishop there for ye honor & dignity of the Empire, (to which all the world paid tribute in ye daies of Augustus Caesar) reputed the chéefest Bishop of the visibleLuke. 2. 1. Church.  Thirdly, that the Bishop of Romes authority, was so farre from being superiour to the Emperours (who was euer called the Emperour of Rome) that no Bishop there for the space of 684. yeares, could haue and enioy any iurisdiction, vnlesse the same Bishop were confirmed by the letters pattents of the Emperour. ThisA. D. 684. point of doctrine (which is of great consequence) is already proued; and that, euen by the testimony of many learned and famous Papists.  Fourthly, that neither the Popes authority, neither Oyle nor Crisme, nor any other Popish ceremony, either is or can be any essentiall part of the Ecclesiastical ministery, and consequently, that the Papist must néedes be condemned, either of too too grosse ignorance, or else of extreame malice, whilest they reiect our Ministers, and repute them méere Lay-men: and that for the want of a few curious and vnprofitable ceremonies, which are not onely meere extrinsecal to the function,

but withall superstitiously abused euery where.  Fifthly, that the Papists condemne themselues in their owne practicall proceedings, whiles they admit our Sacrament of Baptisme by our Ministers administred, andMarke this well. withall reiect as méere Lay-men our Ministers of ye same. For as they supply the accedentall ceremonies in the one, so may they do also wt as great reason in ye other. Wherefore I conclude, that as our Church sheweth both charity and wisedome, in admitting their Bishops and Priests, so doth their Church shew both malice and ignorance, in refusing ours. And that is all indéed, that truly can be inferred of their senslles and péeuish refusall; albeit many silly simply seduced papists, neither doe nor can so conceiue the matter. This my answere is yet confirmed by another Popish practicall vsage. They reiect our Ministers,Silly ignorāt papists are grosly deceiued. because they want their popish beggerly ceremonies: and for all that▪ they grant their owne Ministers to be true Priests still, euen after they haue degraded them, and taken all their ceremonies from them. Marke well, what I shall relate, for it is a wonderment of the new world. The Papists tell vs (and it is a speciall article of late popish faith) that if a popish Priest come into a great market place, where there is great store of wheate-bread, though a thousand or moe loaues in number, and then, and there looking on the same bread, shall pronounce theseThis cannot be denied by popish doctrine. words (hoc est corpus meum, this is my body) with intention to consecrate the same: then forthwith euery loafe of the sayd wheat-bread, is made Christs body, and per concomitantiam as their Schooles terme it) God almighty; so as the people are bound by popish faith and lawes to adore the same loaues, euery loafe as the sonne of the euerliuing God: trial here of was once made a Rome as my self being in Rome, heard from the mouth of a Iesuite. For, as the Iesuite reported to me (and I haue reason to credite him in such a case and cause) a Priest being degraded, and

designed to dye for his homely qualities, as he passed in the stréete by a bakers shop, beheld a great quantity of wheatbread, and recited these words (hoc est corpus meum) and then told the people that he had cōsecrated the same bread;Behold here a great Mystery of popish foolery. so desiring once to be auenged of the Pope, and his godlesse Popelings: Wherupon consultation was had out of hand among the learned there, and sentence resolutely

After which sentence so clearkely pronounced, the bread was carryed away with great solemnity, and such reuerence and adoration exhibited to the same, as was due to the sonne of the euerliuing God. Now, if Popish Priests can this doe, euen after their annointing and greasing taken from them: yea, after their deare Pope hath degraded, and after his best maner vnpriested them, they haue no reason, doubtlesse to say, that our Bishops cannot performe the function of true Bishops, séeing our BishoppesMarke well gentle reader. are consecrated of popish truly made Bishoppes, though without Popish vnprofitable and superstitiously abused ceremonies. This resolution is soundly deduced out of the very bowels of Popish faith and religion.

Secondly, (and this is a thing to be admired,Marke well for Christs sake. comming from a papists mouth) that euery point necessary for saluation, is plainely and cléerely set downe in holy writ.

               I answere:  first, that the Iesuite granteth as much as I desire, when he graunteth the holy scripture to containe all things necessary for our saluation: for doubtlesse, if all things necessary for saluation, be writtenThis is all I desire, in the scripture, it followeth of necessity, that no vnwritten tradition is necessary for the same.  Secondly, thatLo, no vnwritten tradition is necessary for saluation, noting is or can be necessary for the Christian faith, but the same is also necessary for saluation: for otherwise it would follow, (which no Christian may anouch) that a man may be saued without the Christian faith: but S. Athanasius in that créede or summary of faith, (which the Church of Rome receiueth and highly reuerenceth,) affirmethAthanasius in symbol, resolutely, that whosoeuer beleeueth not stédfastly euery iote of the Christian faith, shall perish euerlastingly.  Thirdly, that whosoeuer hath the holy scripture, hath all things necessary for his saluation.  Fourthly, that séeing the Christian faith by popish doctrine, contaïneth many points not necessary for saluation, it followeth of necessity, that many points of popish, so supposed Christian faith, are néedlesse in very déede, and for that respect with some other, our Church of noble England hath abolished the same with spéede: for we are the true reformed Catholikes, who hold constantly the old Roman religion in euery point: but the late start-vp Romish faith is fully

               I answere:  first, that by our Iesuits doctrine (as we haue head) if may be a point of Christian faith, and yet not necessary to saluation, and consequently, ifMarke this point well this point were not knowne by the scriptures, yet might the scripture containe all things néedefull to saluation.  Secōdly that y• holy scripture sheweth itself to be Canical, and the pure word of God: for, as holy Dauid saith, it isPs. 11. v. 105. 2. Pet. 1. 19. Hebr. 4. ver 12.

and so in sundry other things: All which, though foretoldMans pure word must not needes come to passe. by man, cannot but be true and come to passe.

I see it as cleerly as the noone day, that all creatures are subiect to God their maker, that euery word of man is fallible, and that onely Gods will is Canonicall, and cannot but be true. But Christ addeth a limitation and restrictiō to his words, which troubleth me moreLuk. 24: v. 44. then a little. He saith not simply and absolutely, that all things written in the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalmes, must be fulfilled, but that all things which are there written of him, must of necessity come to passe.

               Though Christ vse a restriction, by reason of his occasioned particular application, yet is his argument generall, as which is drawne from the excellencie & infallibility of holy writ: as if he had said, whatsoeuer is written in the law of Moses, in the Prophets and in the Psalmes, yt same must néedes come to passe, and cannot but be true, and consequently, whatsoeuer is there spoken of me, that must néeds come to passe: neither is this mine, but Christs owne exposition, I assure you.

               It is not onely possible, but a thing very easie. Marke well, and vnderstand my discourse aright. Our Sauiour in the same chapter, reproueth his Disciples asLuk. 24. v. 25. they went to Emmaus, condemning them of folly and infidelity, for that they did not simply and generally beléeue all that the Prophets had spoken. Oh fooles (saith Christ) and slow of heart, to beléeue all that the Prophets haue spoken. Againe, another text saith that he began at Moses, and at all the Prophets, & interpreted vnto them in allLuk. 24. v. 27. the Scriptures, the things which were written of him. This is that interpretation which the holy Ghost affoordeth vs. Out of which, I obserue these memorable docoments.  First, that Christ spake absolutely and simply without any restriction at all, of all things written in the Law, the Prophets and the Psalmes.  Secondly, that Christ interpreted in all the Scriptures the things that were written of him.  Thirdly, that all the Scriptures of the Prophets, of Moses, and of the Psalmes, are true, and the Canonicall rule of our faith.
            
            
               Theoph.
               Christ indeed speaketh simply and generally of the Prophets; but he neither nameth Moses, nor the booke of Psalmes.

                   very usual and frequent in the holy Scriptures, it compriseth the whole in the part thereof.  Secondly, that Christ nameth both Moses and all the rest of the old Testament: For after he had reproued his Apostles forLuk. 24. v. 27. not beléeuing all things in the Prophets, the text saith plainely in the words following, that Christ began at Moses, and interpreted in all the Scriptures: and a little after, in the selfe same chapter, he maketh mention both ofv. 44. v. 45. 
                  Moses, of the Prophets, and of the Psalmes: and in the verse then immediately following it is sayd, that Christ opened their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures: so that Christ vndoubtedly meaneth all the scriptures of the old Testament, when synecdochically he meaneth onely the Prophets: which thing I shall yetIoh. 5. v. 45 46. 47.

For had yée beléeued Moses, yée would haue beléeued me, for he wrot of me: but if yée beleeue not his writings, how shall yee beléeue my words? These are the very words of our Lord and Maister Christ: out of which I gather these comfortable lessons.  First, that the writings of Moses accuse the reprobate, and consequently, that they are Canonicall Scripture: for otherwise, neither their condemnation, nor their accusation should be of force.  Secondly, that to beléeue Moses (marke these words) is to beléeue Christ himselfe.  Thirdly, that not to beleeue the writings of Moses, is not to beléeue Christs words, and consequently, that the writings of Moses are Canonicall Scripture, and the pure word of God.

               Theoph.
               What will I say? Is that your question? I will tell you both what I will say and doe: I will say you haue done that, which to this day was euer thought impossible: and this I promise to cause the same to be written in Marble with golden Letters, and to put the stone in Saint Peters Church at Rome, In Perpetuam rei memoriam.

I hold it a damnable sinne to bely the Diuel. Out of these testimonies, I gather very plainely, that all things which euery one is bound to beléeue, are actually conteined in the holy scripture: and consequently y• all the bookes, chapters, verses & sentences which are admitted for Canonical, are truly Canonicall & Gods pure word without y• mixture of mans word: which conclusion, for all that, is it that both our Iesuites and all their cursed Iesuited broode doe violently impugne.
            
            
               Theoph.
               The Papists would seeme to frustrate your conclusion, because they onely beleeue it for the testimony of the Pope, and Church of Rome.

               They would gladly séeme indéed to doe many things which they are not able to performe. But the truth is as I haue said: & thus both briefly & pithily I proue the same. Whatsoeuer is necessary for euery Christian, the same is contained in the scriptures of the Apostles: but the knowledge of all the Bookes, Chapters, Uerses, andMarke well this my probation. Sentences, admitted for Canonical to be truly Canonicall, and the pure word of God, is necessary for euery

Christian, ergo, the same is conteined in the ScripturesGlogismus in prima figura & modo Daril. of the Apostles. The conclusion of this argument cannot be denyed, because it is a perfect Syllogisme, in the first figure, and in the third made called Darij. The proposition is confessed both by Cardinall Bellarmine, and by the Iesuite Parsons. You haue heard their expresse words truly alledged, as themselues in printed bookes haue set them downe so then the difficulty (if there be any at all) resteth in the assumption, viz. if to know the holy Bible toLoe, late Popery is flat heresie be Canonicall and the pure word of God, be necessary for euery Christian, which being a fundamentall point of religion, is so cleere and so apparant to euery one, as methinkes it is a néedlesse labour to take in hand to proue the same. But I proue it:  first, because the knowledge of the holy Gospel & euery part thereof▪ is necessary to euery onsIoh. 10. 22. Rom. 16. Rom 14. 23 Hebr

Secondly, because the Papists themselues doe euer vrge the same, as a necessary point of faith and saluation, so often as it séemeth any way to make for their vnwritten traditions. Thirdly, because all the articles of faith deduced out of the sciptures, depend thereupon: for these are the Iesuite S. R. his owne words, yet this is a point of the Christian faith, yea, thereupon depend all the articles we gather out of Scripture. Thus disputeth our Iesuite in his pretensed answere to the Downe-fall of Popery, after he hath bitterly many times denyed▪ thatNote this point well▪ S. R. pag▪

                   the holy Scripture doth shew it selfe to be Gods word: but the force of truth is so mighty in operation, ye while of malice he striueth against it, he vnawares confoundeth himselfe, and pleadeth for the truth in very déed. Fourthly, because the Iesuite S. R. vrged, and as it were deadly wounded with the sharp pikes of his aduersaries arguments, plainely & resolutly confesseth the doctrine which I defend. In one place hee hath these expresse words: me thinkes he plainely auoucheth (he speaketh of Saint Austen) yt God hath procured euery thing to be cléerely written,

which to know, is necessary for euery mans saluation.Pag. 287. In another place hee hath these words: whatThe Iesuite vnawares▪ killeth the Pope & his religion. things soeuer are necessary, are manifest out of scripture. Now sir, what man can thinke our Iesuite to bee in his right wits, that thus woundeth himselfe with his owne weapons? for he doth not onely grant, that euery thing necessary for euery mans saluation, is manifest in ye scripture, but withall, that euery necessary thing is cléerely written in the same: and consequently, he granteth vnaware & against himselfe, either that to beléeue the holy Bible to be the pure word of God, is a trifle, a thing of small moment, and not at all necessary to saluation, which if the Papists doe, they must perforce condemne themselues, and vtterly ouerthrow their Romish faith; or else, that the same is plainely and cleerely set downe in the holy Scripture; the cause is cléere, I hope I haue said enough.
            
            
               Theoph.
               All the world knoweth, old and yong, rich and poore, learned and vnlearned, that to know and beleeue the holy Bible to be Gods word, is so necessary to saluation, as none without it can be saued.
               It now remaineth for my full satisfaction and resolution in all points of Catholike doctrine in controuersie, that if I know how to answere the Papists concerning one point of doctrine, wherwith they neuer cease to charge you & your profession, I would think my selfe able to answere and confound all Papists in the world, and to perswade all indifferently affected persons, to abhorre and detest late start-vp popery world without end.

               They charge you to hold & teach, that the best liuer among you sinneth in the best act he doth, which seemeth a doctrine so strange & irksome to all godly eares, as my selfe cānot but detest the same: for if we can do nothing but sinne, we must perforce condemne all good workes, all preaching, all teaching, and all holy conuersation.

               THis proposition, which séemeth to trouble you more then a litle (the iust man sinneth in euery good work) may admit a double sense and meaning, viz, a rigorous and a fauourable interpretation. I

Thirdly, his state after regeneration vntill his glorification.  Fourthly, his state after glorification world without end. In the first state, albeit man sinned indéede, and thereby made both himselfe and his posterity subiect to eternal torment: yet was he so created of God his maker, that he might haue liued without sinne for euer and aye. In the second state, man can doe nothing that good is, but sinne continually. In the third state, man by Gods grace and great mercy is enabled to do good, though not wholly to

                  schew sinne, saue onely according to the measure of his regeneration. In the fourth state, man is so confirmed in grace, that he cannot sinne world without end. Which distinction being well marked and remembred, we shall easily vnderstand, that albeit man can neuer be without sinne in this life but adde sinne to sinne continually, yet may he by the grace of regeneration, do good workes, euen while he sinneth mortally.

                   things denied, and ambiguous things distingushed: which being true, as it is most true indéede, if we shall distinguish regeneration aright, the truth of this intricate question will soone appeare: viz. that one may aswell both sinne and do good at one and the same time, as he may at the same time be both a father and a sonne.

abuse and wrest the holy scriptute to a contrary sense and meaning, fraudulently perswading their silly deuoted vassals, that originall concupiscence remaineth onely in the body, and not at all in the soule, where as the truth is farre otherwise, as holy wridtoth euidently co

               Marke well my discourse, that ye may vnderstand the same. Saint Iohn hath these expresse words: which are borne hot of blood nor of the will of the flesh, norIoh. 13 of the will of man, but of God: in which asseueration, the holy Euangelist vnderstandeth by the word (flesh) the whole man as he is corrupt and vnregenerate.
            
            
               Theoph.
               How can it be proued, that Saint Iohn: vnderstandeth the corrupt man by the word (flesh.)?
            
            
               Remig.
               These foure are distinguished in the Euangelist, blood, the will of the flesh, the wil of the man, and God: by which distinction he giueth vs to vnderstand, that the will of the flesh doth connotate the whole man corrupt: I proue it, because the Euangelist distinguisheth blood, flesh, and man, one from another by a particular dissunctiue, and God from them all, by a particular aduersatiue.
            
            
               
               Theoph.
               Your affirmance of the quadruple distinction, is euident, but how should flesh connotate the corrup man, it doth not so well appeare.
            
            
               Remig.

                  nate so much vnto his reader  Secondly, because the Euangelist addeth an adiunct to the word (flesh) which can no way agrée to the body.
            
            
               Theoph.

               The will of the flesh: for will is added vnto flesh, not vnto blood, and it is a proper faculty of the soule, but not of the body: for the flesh or body hath no will at all.The body doth not cou

In these words the holy Prophet sheweth plainely, that he was regenerate, and yet not frée from sinne: for in that he desireth his heart to be purified, and his spirit to be renued, he giueth vs to vnderstand, that his soule is not frée from sinne, nor himselfe perfectly regenerate. On the other side, in that he prayeth God not to take away his holy spirit from him, nor to cast him away from his presence; he sheweth euidently to the indifferent reader, that he is regenerate, though not wholly, yet in part. The second text confirmeth the same, in these words: though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed daily. The third2 Cor. 4. v. 16. Ephes. 4. 23 Col. 3. 9. text is yet plainer, in these words: be renewed in the spirit of your minde, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holines. The fourth text is as plaine, in these words: séeing yée haue put off the old man with his works, and haue put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. The fifth text doth further confirme the same, in these words: night and day praying excéedingly that we might sée your face, and might accomplish1 Thes. 3. v. 10. 1 Cor. 13 v 12. that which is lacking in your faith. By al which texts it is very cléere and euident, that the regenerate man is

Paul throughout a whole chapter, doth in effect intend no other thing, but onely to demonstrate by many arguments, that mans regeneration is vnperfect aswell in the soule as in the body: two verses onely will suffice, for the cléering of our question. The former verse is conteined in those words:v. 14. v. 18. for we know that the law is spirituall, but I am carnall, fold vnder sinne. The latter verse, in these words: for I know, that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing, for to will is present with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good. Out of which verses, I obserue these memorable doctrines.  First, that by the word (flesh) must néedes be vnderstoode the whole man, as he is corrupt and not regenerate: I proue it, because the Apostle saith, (in me) and expoundeth it by his flesh.  Secondly, that the word (flesh) cannot determine the word (me) vnlesse it signifie the corrupt parts both of body and soule: for the words (I and (me) do connotate his person, not barely any one part of his soule or body.  Thirdly, that he saith, no good dwelled in him: albeit he confesseth both in this chapter, & in sundry other places, that the grace of God and the holy Ghost dwelleth in him,1 Cor. 15. 10. 1 Cor. 6 v. 19. Rom. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 13. 12 and consequently, that when he saith, no good dwelleth in him, he meaneth of the parts vnregenerate, which he nameth his flesh, saying, in me, that is, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. Fourthly, that the holy vessell of our Lord Iesus, affirmeth himselfe to be sold vnder sinne, and to be carnall, and consequently, that sinne is in him formally throughout all his vnregenerate parts, and not onely in his body materially, as our Pope and Iesuits would enforce vs to beéeue: for though the regenerate be spirituall in the greater part, yet are they in part carnal; as the holy Apostle here auoucheth of himselfe,

and S. Iames of himselfe and all the rest: howbeit, Saint Paul & S. Iames were as spirituall as any this day liuing, if not more: yet the best liuers of all haue not so put on the new man, but the reliques of the old man still remaine

               Secondly, the same truth of mans vnperfect regeneration,Secundè princip. ter. may be proued by euident reason. For the soule which giueth life, sense, and mouing to the body, and doth informe the same, cannot possibly be an enemy to the body,anima est forma corporis. and haue continuall warres wich it. For (as the Apostle teacheth vs) no man euer yet hated his owne fleshe, but nourisheth and cherisheth the same, euen as Christ doth his Church: and it is confirmed, because the flesh couetethEphes. 5. v. 29. nothing without the soule.

               Theoph.
               You haue so soundly proued that mans regeneration is vnperfect, and that originall concupiscence still remaineth euen formally in the vnregenerate, not onely in

his body but also in his soule, as it is able fully to perswade any indifferent reader, and all such as are carefull of their saluation. Howbeit I still stand doubtful, & am at my wits end what to thinke of this your receiued Maxime; Iustus in omni opere bono peccat; the iust man sinneth in euery good acte.
            
            
               Remig.
               I told you afore, that it is one thing to sinne in doing a good act, another thing, to sinne while the good act is a doing. The former way no man sinneth at any time; but the latter way, the best liuer on earth, sinneth continually. For of originall vncleannesse there is that yet sticking in the best, for the which God may iustly condemne them to hell fire.
            
            
               Theoph.
               I remember the distinction very well, but there are many texts of holy Scripture, which seeme to make against the same.
            
            
               Remig.
               Propound them all one by one, and omit not any that troubleth you: for I hope in God so to answere them, as you shall neuer henceforth stand in doubt thereof.
            
            
               Theoph.
               God himselfe saith, that the wickednesse of man was great on earth, and that all the imaginations ofGen. 6. 50 the thoughts of his heart were only euill continually. Out of which words proceeding from the spirit of God, I obserue these memorable points of doctrine.  First, that man is very wicked.  Secondly, that not onely some, but euen  all the imaginations of his heart, are euill.  Thirdly, that they are not only euill for a day, weeke, moneth or a yeere, but euen continually.  Fourthly, that they are onely euill, and haue no good at all in them, and consequently, that man can do no good at all, but sinneth in his best acts continually.
            
            
               Remig.
               I answere: that the text by you alleaged, is vnderstood in the corrupt man before his regeneration, in whom there is no good at any time; not of the regenerate

man, in whom there is much good continually. I proue it many wayes:  First, because in the very next chapter, theGen. 7. 1. spirit of God pronounceth Noah righteous in his sight. Secondly, because holy writ affirmeth constantly that Zacharias
                  Luk. 1. 5. 6. and Elizabeth, were both iust before God, and walked in all his commandements.  Thirdly, because the 1 Ioh. 3. 9. holy Apostle of our Lord Iesus, telleth vs very plainely, that he which is borne of God sinneth not: yea, S. Iohn procéedeth further, and auoucheth resolutely, that he cannot sinne, because he is borne of God.  Fourthly, because 1 Ioh. 3. 10. by doing of righteousnesse, the children of God are knowne and discerned from the children of the Diuel.  Fifthly, because y• Apostle comparing the works of Caine 
                  1 Ioh. 3. 12. and of Abel together, affirmeth the workes of the one to be euill, and the others to be good.  Sixthly, because S. Iohn telleth vs of Uirgins which are not defiled with women,Apo

                     . 14. 4. but follow the Lambe whithersoeuer he goeth.  Seuenthly, because the holy scripture commendeth Cornelius for a deuout man, and one that feared God, and affirmeth his prayers and almes to haue come vp into remembrance before God.  Eighthly, because Peter did a good act when he Mat. 16. v. 16. 17. confessed Christ to be the sonne of the liuing GOD: for Christ answering, pronounced him blessed, affirming, not flesh and bloud, but God aboue to haue reuealed it to him.  Ninthly, because they are happy that suffer persecution Mat. 5. v. 10 for righteousnesse.  Tenthly, because the whole Scripture (especially the Epistle to the Hebrewes) maketh frequentHebr. 11. mention of the good workes which the children of God haue done.
            
            
               Theoph.
               The Scripture saith plainely, that wee all arePsal. 51. 5. Ps. 1 43. v. 2. Psa 1 30. 3. Iac. 3. 2. Prou. 20. 9. conceiued and borne in sinne, that no flesh can be iustified in Gods fight, that if he straitly marke our iniquities, none is able to abide it, that the holy Apostles offend in many things, that all haue sinned and are depriued of the glory of God: ergo, it seemeth that the best liuer sinneth, in the

best worke he doth.
            
            
               Remig.
               True it is, that the best liuers on earth are great sinners, and that they may iustly be damned to hellAug. lib. 9. confes. c, 13. for the same. For as S. Austen saith grauely: Woe to the best liuer on earth, if God iudge him, his mercy set apart. But hereupon can it neuer be concluded that the iust man sinneth in euery worke he doth.
            
            
               Theoph.
               The best workes of the regenerate are vnperfect, and consequently the regenerate man sinneth in the best worke he doth?
            
            
               Remig.
               Your consequence doth not hold, the reason is at hand, viz. because euery imperfection, neither doth nor can make a good act euill: for although imperfection be so linked and chained with sinne in y• regenerate, that whersoeuer it be found, there is sinne also in the same subiect; yet is not that sin in the act well done, but either in some other act euill done, or else in the omission of that which ought to be done. Let vs take an example for the illustration of the truth and question now in hand; and let vs suppose, that S. R hath lent 40. pounds vnto T. B. to be repaid vpon May-day next, at which day y• said T. B. bringeth onely 30. pounds, being all y• he possibly can prouide. In this ease, the debtour tendereth an vnperfect paiment to the Creditour. Howbeit, he doth not wrong the creditour in bringing him 30. pounds, but the iniury is done in not bringing more.
            
            
               Theoph.
               He wrongeth his creditor by his vnthankefulnesse, in that he doth not bring him the iust summe which he borrowed.
            
            
               Remig.
               The Creditor is wronged indéed, yet not in y• paiment of the 30. pounds, but in the non paiment of other ten pounds. Imperfection is euer cheyned with sin, as is already sayd, yet the sinne or wrong done in this case to the Creditor, is not in the 30. pounds truly paid, but in the ten pounds remaining vnpaid. For example

sake. A seruant receiuing of his maister ten shillings to be distributed to the poore, giueth onely eight shillings thereof to them, and reserueth two shillings to himselfe. In this case the seruant trespasseth generally: yet not in distributing eight shillings, a part of his charge, but in kéeping back two shillings which he should haue giuen: For when a seruant is commanded to do althing, which hée doth onely in part, but not wholly, the offence is not in that which he doth, but in that which he leaueth vndone.Luk. 18. v. 13. 14. Exod. 1. 17. Exod. 32. v. 27. 1 Sam. 1. 15. Heb. 11. 31, 2 Sam. 12. v 7. 13. Mat. 26. 75. Act. 10. 2. 1 Reg. 15. 11. 2 Reg. 18. 6 2 Reg. 23. 25. Act. 13. 9. Rom. 7. v. 15. 25. Hebr. 11. Euen so is it in the question now in hand. For the lowly Publican sinned not in smiting his breast, and in asking mercy for his sinnes. The Mid-wiues, Shiphrah & Puah sinned not in that they feared God, and disobeyed y• kings wicked commandement. Moses sinned not, in s

King Asa sinned not in doing right in the eyes of the Lord. King Ezechias sinned not in cleaning to the Lord, and in not departing from him. Iosias sinned not in turning to y• Lord with al his heart, wt all his soule, and with all his might. Paul full of the holy Ghost, sinned not in reprouing Elimas the sorcerer, for peruerting the right waies of the Lord: neither yet in hating the sinne which he could not auoide. Abel sinned not in offering a greater sacrifice then Caine, by which he obtained Gods owne testimony that he was righteous. Abraham sinnedHebr. 11. v. 8. 17. Gen. 22. v. 2. 3. 9. 10. Iob. 1. v. 1. 22. Luk. 1. 5, 6. not in obeying God when he was called, neither in offering vp his onely sonne when God commanded him so to do. Iob sinned not in being vpright and iust, in fearing God, and eschewing euill. Zacharias and Elizabeth sinned not in walking in all the commandements of the Lord,

without reproch. S. Stephen full of the holy Ghost, andAct. 7. 59. ready to giue his life for the truths sake, sinned not in calling on God and saying, Lord Iesus receiue my spirit.
                  1 Tim. 2. 7. 2. 3. The regenerate sin not in walking after the spirit. Rom. 8, 4. Dutifull subiects sinne not in praying dayly for their Soueraignes: for holy writ pronounceth it to be good and acceptable in the sight of God. All which, and many other like testimonies (which in regard of breuity, I now omit) do proue and euidently conuince, that though the regenerate sinne while they do their good workes, yet do they not sinne in doing the same: for it is one thing to sin in doing the worke, another thing to sin while the worke is a doing.
            
            
               Theoph.
               Your discourse hath fully satisfied me in this intricate and difficult question: I perceiue your distinction to be as true, as it is subtile: the ignorance whereof, hath brought no small ruine to the Church of God: howbeit, sundry mighty obiections, may be made against the same: which by your fauour I shall propound as they come to my mind.
            
            
               Obiection first.
               
                  Theoph.
                  It seemeth to many a thing impossible, that a man while he sinneth, should do good.
               
               
                  Remig.
                  It is no more impossible, then it is for the same man to be a father while he is a sonne.
               
               
                  Theoph.
                  The same man cannot be both a father and a sonne, at one and the same time in one and the same respect, but in diuerse respects, though at the same time.
               
               
                  Remig.
                  True that is, and I desire no more: the holyRom. 7. 25. Apostle decideth the controuersie, in these golden words: I my selfe in my mind serue the law of God, but in my flesh the law of sinne: here the chosen vessell of God doth plainely expresse, and liuely lay open before our eyes, that himselfe both did good workes, and also sinned while he did the same, though not in the same respect: for, to serue

the law of God, is a right good worke, but to serue the law of sinne, is a great offence: yet both these the Apostle did at the same time, though not in the same respect: for, as he was regenerate, he serued God truly; but in the vnregenerate parts both of body & soule, or flesh and mind, (which with the Apostle are all one) he sinned damnably.
               
               
                  Theoph.
                  How can the Apostles act be vnperfect, and yet without sinne?
               
               
                  Remig.
                  I haue so plainely vnfolded this difficulty already, that I greatly admire, how you can bee ignorant thereof: imperfection, though it bee euer chained with sinne in the regenerate, doth not for all that connotate hisRom. 7, 25. act well donebu; teither some other act euill done, or else the 
                        •
                     mission of the act that should be done: For example, Saint Paul, when he serued the law of God in his mind, did a good act, though vnperfectly, and sinned not in doing the same: howbeit at the same time he sinned perfectly, in seruing the law of sin neuerthelesse his imperfection consistedPsal. 5. 4. Psal. 6. 8. not in seruing y• law of God, which was an act pleasing God, who neuer is or can be pleased with sinne: but it consisted in seruing the law of sinne, which was perfectly an act, no way pleasing God: The imperfection ariseth not of that which is well done, but of that which is either ill done, or left vndone.Are

                  The holy and auncient father Dionysius Ariopagita, vnfoldeth this difficulty, whiles he affirmeth more to be required to good, then to euill: for perfect good, requireth a perfect and intire cause, but perfect euill, issueth out of euery defect: Bonum exintegra causa, malum exquolibet defectu?

                  You must either marke the distinction well, or else you can neuer vnderstand the same a right. I will giue you a very plain example by which you may easily sée the truth thereof. Take one penne full of blacke incke in your right hand, an other full of red incke in your left hand; this done, draw with the said pennes two long lines at one and the same time: in this case▪ it is very

cléere and euident, that in making a blacke line you doe not make a red, neither yet in making a red line, doe you make a blacke: howbeit, while you make the blacke line, you make also the red, and semblably, while yée make the red, you make also the blacke: but doublesse, in making blacke you do not make red, neither yet in making red do you make blacke: euen so may you sinne (it cannot with reason be denied) while you doe a good worke, and yet not sinne in doing the same.

                  Your example doth giue me a perfect insightMat. 6. ver. 24 Luk. 3. 16 into the question now in hand: but our sauiour telleth vs, that no man can serue two maisters: how then can a man1. Ioh. 3. v. 8. 9. Ioh. 8 v. 34. Rom 6. v. 20 2. both doe well and sinne at once? for to doe well▪ is to serue the best maister, and to sinne, is to serue the worst of all: that is, euen God and the diuell.

                        5. ver. 8. 21 Dan. 2. v. 48. 49. and subiect to the other: for so doth Saint Paul teach vs in these expresse words, seruants, obey your maisters according to the flesh, with feare and trembling, in singlenesse of your hearts, as vnto Christ: loe, a seruant may obey his carnall master, and in so doing Christ himselfe: so did holy Ioseph serue God, and the King of Egypt: so did Daniel serue God, and the King of Babel.  Secondly, Gal. 5. 17. that though the regenerate sinne daily, and be continually assaulted with the cumbat of the flesh against the spirit, yet doe they not suffer sinne to reigne in them, neither doe they consent to the vnlawfull desires thereof, but vtterly hate and detest the same: and consequently, they serue not two maisters, but one onely, euen our Lord IesusCor. 6. v. 11. 1. Ioh 5 v. 4. 1. Ioh. 3▪ v. 6 ver. 6. 7. 9. Christ: for, to hate sinne, to fight courageously against sinne, and to be at continuall destance with it, as the Iewes were with the Cananites, is not to serue sinne, but to be a mortall enemy to sinne, and rather the master then the seruant thereof: which sense our Sauiour himselfe

doth plainely insinuate, in these words immediatlyMat. 6. v. 24 following: for either he shall hata the one, and loue the other, or else he shall leane to the one, and despise the other: as if he had said, no man can truly and dutifully serue two masters, as a seruant ought to doe: for it is not the part of a seruant to hate his master, to withstand his commaundes, and euery houre to fight with him, as the regenerate children of God do continually with sin: yea, the Apostle confirmeth the same sense, when he plainely confessethRom. 7. v. 19. 20. of himselfe, that he did not that good which he would, but that euill which he would not: and thereupon concludeth, that he himselfe did it not, but the sinne that dwelled in him: for albeit sinne, against his will remained still in him, and had daily conflicts and continuall cumbats with him, yet had he the victory and vpper hand1 Ioh. 5. v. 4 ouer sinne, in that he stood constantly at defiance with it, and would neuer yéelde consent vnto it. Thirdly, that one may serue two contrary maisters secundum quid, though not simpliciter; in part, but not simply, wholly, or totally: and this sense doth the holy Apostle affoord vs,Rom. 7. 25. while he confesseth resolutely, that he himselfe serued the law of God in his mind, but in his flesh the law of sinne: for, by reason of the reliques of the flesh, and grace of the spirit, he was deuided in himselfe.

                  This seemeth to smell of Popery: for they teach, that the regenerate sinne onely in the body materially, and not at all in the soule.

Popish sense by any meanes be true, séeing by it none liuing, no Pope, no Cardinall, no Iesuite, can possibly please God: The reason is euident, because none can liue on earth, but which haue their soules in their bodyes. This sense the Apostle doth plainly deliuer in these words immediatly following: now ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, because the spirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any man haue not the spirit of Christ, the same is not his: here it is cléere, that the word (flesh) doth connotateRom. 8. v. 9 whatsoeuer is in man vnregenerate, but not the body which the soule informeth. This sense is more plainely confirmed in another place, where it is written; for we know, that the law is spirituall, but I am carnall sould vnder sinne: where we sée euidently, that the Apostle byRom. 7. 14. (flesh) meaneth neither the body onely, nor the soule onely, but both body and soule, so farre forth as they are vngenerate: for the word (carnall) doth not barely connotate any one part, either of body or of soule, but the whole person of man, not yet purified with the grace of regeneration. The words are very emphaticall, (for IGods precepts are kept in some degrees, but not perfectly. am carnall) S. Paul speaketh of himselfe, being the regenerate child of God, and for all that fréely acknowledgeth himselfe to be carnall, and sold vnder sinne.
