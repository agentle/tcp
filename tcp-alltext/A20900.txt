                     MInding to anſweare the little booke of Aubertus, concerning the originall of mettals, and their cauſes, although it be not greatly worthie of anſwere, yet I neither can, or may paſſe ouer this: greatlie maruelling at the raſhnes of thoſe mē which dare curſe and condemne this arte, approued by the authoritie of ſo many ancient and great men, eſpeciallie Hermes▪Triſmegiſtus, Geber, Lullus, Arnoldus, Villanouanus, and our Auicen himſelfe, Whoſe teſtimonies, confirmed with authoritie and arguments, yea and with practiſe it ſelfe, are of more waight, then that they ſhould ſo eaſily be ſhakē of, with the ſlender reaſons, & t

wicked men, that the Chymiſtes are euill ſpoken of: but to condemne thinges for their abuſe, ſpecially of ſo great weight (as I know and defend this to be) truely it neither can, or ought to be ſo. For it openeth vnto vs ſo many works of the almightie God, it laie
                        •

                        •
                      of Nature, that they ſhew themſelues vnkinde toward man that would haue this art buried.
                  As touching Paracelſus, I haue not taken vpon mee the defence of his diuinitie, neither did I euer thinke to agree with him in all points, as though I were ſworne to his doctrine: but beſides the teſtimonie wherewith Eraſmus adorneth him in certaine Epiſtles, I dare be bolde to ſay and defend, that he teacheth many things almoſt diuinely, in Phiſicke, which the thankfull poſteritie can neuer commend and praiſe ſufficientle: whereof I truſt occaſion ſhall be geuen to ſpeake in another place. But that all men may know with what diſcretion (thou Aubertus) haſt taken in hand to oppugne theſe things: goe to, we will reaſon of thoſe two points, which in the Preface of thy little book thou haſt taken vpon thee to handle. But thou art a man truelie (as I perceuie) of a verie ſharpe witte. The one of thy points which thou handleſt, is concerning Laudanum, accounted verie perilous: the other of the burnt eyes of a crabbe, which you alſo think to be ridiculous.
                  And firſt, becauſe you thinke it not to be the Laudanum of Dioſcorides, you demaund what it ſhould be. Learn then this of ine, that this laudable medicine is ſo called of the Chymical Phyſicians, and that it doeth plainlie anſweare vnto his name, if you call it Lawdanum. But you ſay it is made of Opium, Is that it that bringeth ſuch a maze into your minde? Indeede Opium is put into it, but of a farre better preparation then is commonlie in vſe: not without the ſpirite of wine, or the infuſion of Diambrae, by certaine

monethes, not without the eſſence of Safferon, Caſtoreum, Coralles, Perles, Mumia, and the oiles of C
                        •
                     namon, Cloues, Mace, and Anniſeedes: of all which, being rightly mingled (as it is the manner of arte) is made that moſt excellent medicine, to put away all vnkinde heates, to ſtay all fluxes, and to aſſwage in marueilous ſort all manner of greefes: yet ſo, that it doeth not extinguiſh the naturall heate, but rather preſerue and defende it by ſtrenthening the ſpirites, much leſſe that it doeth benumme them, or take away the motions from the parts (which is ridicular to be ſpoken) but with a certeine marueilous qualitie wherewith it excelleth, it helpeth the powers, as by the deſcription of the foreſaid things, and their due and not common preparation and mixture may eaſilie be gathered.
                  What will you ſay if I adde more, that there is put into it the true eſſence of golde, which is ſo commended in olde time, by the writings of learned Philoſophers and Phyſicians? I beleeue you would laugh at this eſſence, which is vnknowen vnto you, yet familiar vnto many philoſophers. But I affirme that golde to be a moſt temperate and effectuall remedie to helpe the ſtrength of nature, againſt melancholike affections, weake ſtomackes, paſſions of the heart, and ſuch as be extreamly ſadde.
                  Truelie you may worthe lie beleue, that there is much more force in his eſſence, then in your leafe golde. And this you will graunt (my friend Aubertus) that there is greater force of ſecrete qualities in that moſt fine golde, then in your brothes ſodden with golde. Neither yet doe I thinke you doe beleeue (for that were too abſurde) that golde which cannot be waſted or burned with the heate of the fire, can be ſo digeſted or ouercome by naturall heare, but that it may by ſome meane ſtreng hen the hart the ſubſtance remaining whole, when as the opinion of the Philoſophers is this, that all earth is dead, and that it is only the ſpirites of things that can worke in bodies. But Laudanum it ſelfe, although it be opiat, yet is it not ſo

to be reprehended. For if it were not ſo corrected afore, it were very dangerous, & for his extreame coldnes deadlie, as the Paracelſians which are the folowers of the true and auncient phiſicke, doe well vnderſtand. For neither doeth any of them doubt, but that Opinm, to take away his venemous force, is corrected of many, only with ſafferon, caſtoreum and mirre, which correction doeth nothing hinder, but that it may be done with a better preparation: for Aloes alſo is waſhed, that it frette not the veines with his ſharpnes: and blacke Elebore is made ſo commodious for vſe, with the ſpirite of wine, and oile of Anieſeedes, (that you may learne alſo of the Chymicke Phiſicians) that it may be ſafelie geuen to children againſt the dropſey, and all melancholie affections. Therefore opiat medicines are not ſo raſhlie and vnaduiſedlie to be condemned, of which are made ſundrie medicines to aſſwage the vehement paines of the collicke, reines, pluriſies, and goutes: to prouoke ſleepe, to eaſe the cough, to ſtoppe ſpitting of bloud, and to ſtay all reumes, ſuch as is that Philonium which is allowed of all auncient Phyſicions.
                  Alſo opiat things are neceſſarie in medicines that expell poiſon, Antidotes▪
                      to ſtrengthen the principall partes, to withſtande the malignitie of any poiſon, and infinite other affects, as may be ſeene in that excellent triacle, deſcribed by Andromachus the elder, into which 3. ounces of Opium is put▪ Likewiſe in the fourth and laſt preparation of Mitridate, which Galen, Aetius, and other Greekes, haue drawen from the ancient Phiſicians, Antipater and Cleophantus, whoſe qualities they haue deſcribed to be moſt like vnto the triacle. Peraduenture you will except, that the compoſition of this our Laudanum, is not ſo temperate, as this compoſition of triacle. Therefore you ſhould know it firſt before you reprehende it, which notwithſtanding, both reaſon doeth commend, and experience ſhewe

                     h to be very profitable. Which onely medicine it were much better for you and ſuch like to haue,

for the curing of many diſeaſes, then thoſe ſundrie decoctions of herbes, wherwith many are moſt miſerably tormented. Plin. lib. 20 nat hiſt. cap. 18.
                     
                     Plinius writeth, that Licinius the father of Cecinna, killed himſelfe with Opium, being wearie of his life. But I am aſſured, that there can none be found that hath been hurt by the vſe of our Laudanum, which you notwithſtanding falſly and ſhameleſlie doe write: yea many learned and godlie men will auouch, that it is not without reaſon geuen, but with moſt happie ſucceſſe, and profite to the ſicke, in all manner of rewmes, and to ſwage inflammations, and all other griefes aforeſaid. The compoſition of which moſt excellent medicine, and the preparation deſcribed, which is vnknowen to you, and ſuch as you are: I had put in print if your writings had not forced me to conſider, whether it were expedient to caſte pearles before euery one to treade vpon.
                  Now I come to the other medicine, which you call a ieſt, and laugh becauſe we miniſter the eies of Crabs calcined, to thoſe that are ſicke of a quartane: and ſpecially becauſe we preſcribe for one doſe. ʒ. i. ſs. of this powder, and his mixture, for the cure of the quartane: and you conclude, that the whole Lacus Lemanus will ſcarce yeld ſo many eies of Crabbes, which certeinly is moſt true: for there be no crabbes in that lake, but many Creuiſes, which you (my Aubert) haue not well noted. For there be foure kindes of thoſe ſhell fiſhes, which the Greekes call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . The one is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, a Locuſt. Another they call Gamarum, which Galen calleth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . The thirde 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which they call Squilla. The fourth is the Crabbe, which the Greekes call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     ▪ All theſe the learned know to be ſundrie kindes.
                  The Aſtachi which you ſuppoſed to be Crabbes, and of the Frenchmen are called Eſcreuiſes, are like vnto Locuſtes, and doe little or nothing differ, but onely by a varietie of certaine forepartes and armes: for they haue a long bodie, and a long taile, whereupon there are founde fiue ſinnes. Only the Crabbes haue a round bodie, and

no taile, for they haue little vſe of it, becauſe they liue neere the earth, and creepe into hollowe places, & ſwim not much. But for your better vnderſtanding, you maie conſult with Ariſtotle, Pl

But you will ſay, there is no great regard to be geuen vnto words, and that theſe kindes of ſhell fiſh, for the moſt parte, are confounded among them ſelues. Let it be ſo, this I would alſo ſpeake by the way, becauſe I ſee you doe lacke them, and that our diſputation might be both more euident, you thinke it two waies abſurd, that the eies of crabbes calcined, ſhould be preſcribed in a quartane, becauſe that by their drith and ſharpenes they increaſe the diſcaſe. O ſubtile argument, and worthie of ſuch a Phiſicion. We are not ignorant (my Aubertus) that the continent cauſe or matter of the quartane ague, is the very iuice of melancholie, which by his proper cauſes being gathered much together, that it cannot be ruled by the naturall heate, at length putrifieng, it inflameth this feuer. This melancholie humor the Phiſicians make double: the one naturall, which is as the fex and ſlime of bloud: the other aduſt, which is as it were, the congeled tartar or aſhes of certaine burnt h

The timelie vſe of which medicines, chieflie is both requiſite and greatlie commended in quartanes.

                        Cap. 11.more ſtronglie then vnburned, by how much the bodie is made more ſubtile, rcceiuing his qualities of the fire. Alſo he writeth in the ſame book thoſe medicines which conſiſt of thinne partes, haue more force then they of

groſſe partes, although they had like qualitie, becauſe they pearce better: for which cauſe onely wee vſe calcined Crabbes, to looſe thoſe feces, and tartarous humors. For by calcination, the ſalt of things is drawen out, and ſalt muſt be diſſolued with ſalt onely, if you doe well vnderſtand it, and ſo you ſhall learne that diſeaſes are not to be cured with cōtraries, but like with like, although as yet you perceiue not the reaſon. Otherwiſe, how could you ſay that the ſtones of ſpunges, burnt glaſſe, Goates bloud dried, the aſhes of Cocles, Lapis Iudaicus calcined, or the bone of a cuttle, with ſo great force coulde helpe the ſtone, or grauell of the reines. I know you will flie to the Aſſes ſacred anchore, namelie, of ſecrete qualities, which notwithſtanding, reaſon it ſelfe teacheth to be done with the ſalt which doeth diſſolue them, and expel them by vrine, what will you then ſay of the hedge ſparrow, that laudable medicine of auncient Phyſicians, for the ſame diſeaſe, whereof Paul Aeginet. lib. 3. cap. 45. where he leaueth it thus written: This (ſaith hee) pouthered whole with ſalt, and often eaten rawe, driueth out the ſtones that are alreadie growen by vrine, and letteth thē not to growe againe afterward: but if it be burned whole with his feathers, & all his aſhes, by it ſelfe, or with a little pepper dronk with old wine & hony, it worketh the ſame effect. Thus you ſee how the ancient Phyſiciās did vſe the aſhes, which you call abſurd, and in what diſeaſes: euen in curing the ſtone of the reines, whoſe matter is alſo ſuch a groſſe humor, that with heat it groweth to a ſtone. How much more Crabbes calcined preuaile againſt that diſeaſe, is noted of Hollerius & Mathiolus, and a thouſand times hath beene proued by certain experience. Neither will I paſſe ouer (among other medicines which are vſed for this diſeaſe) Chriſtall, which is the chiefe: Chriſtall (I ſay) calcined, in a reuerberatorie, out of which after is drawen his ſalt, of whoſe diſſolution, in a moiſt place, is made a moſt excellent oile, very profitable to put away all obſtructions of the bowels. Wherefore you may not

thinke it ſo ridiculous, that a medicine ſhould be taken out of the calcined eyes of Crabbes, neither ſo to ſpue out your bitter poiſon againſt it. This will I alſo adde out of Galene, and the opinion of all the auncienteſt, that the Crabs them ſelues calcined, euen by the propertie of their whole ſubſtance, are marueilous effectuall againſt the biting of mad De ſimpl. med facult. cap. 30. lib. 7.
                     dogges. And Galens wordes which he reporteth of his maſter Pelope, doe ſhewe that madnes to be a moſt drie infection▪ It is not without cauſe (ſaith hee) that the Crabbe (being a waterie creature) ſhould helpe them that are bitten of a mad dog, in whom it is to be feared, leaſt they ſhould fall into a moſt drie diſeaſe, that is, madneſſe. Nowe there remaineth that I ſhould ſpeak of the ſharpnes which you finde in the calcination of Crabbes: which (as you ſay) doeth increaſe the quartane. But I feare leaſt by thoſe wordes the learned may thinke you vtterly ignorant what a ſharpe taſt is. For it is eaſie for vs to ſhewe, that the aſhes of Crabs are not ſharpe: for al ſharpe thinges (as it is knowen to Phyſicians) are verie hote, of which Phiſicians make two ſortes. The one ſorte may be eaten, the other vnapt to be eaten. Theſe haue a certaine ſweete, although obſcure qualitie De ſimpl. med. facul. lib. 2. cap. 17.

And thoſe truelie are to be called ſharpe when they are not mingled with ſtrange qualities, whoſe proper terme and ende is to burne, as it is the qualitie of ſower things to cleanſe, of ſweete, to nouriſh. And that the aſhes of Crabbes worke not that effect, Galens wordes doe ſhewe, where hee diſputeth of De ſimpl. med. facul. cap. 18.
                     the differences of bitter and ſharpe taſte: for the ſharpe (ſaith he) hath certaine moiſture mingled with it, but the bitter he confeſſeth to haue a hotte and drie qualitie, and ſaith they are like (as a man may well compare them) vnto aſhes. By which reaſon you ſhould better haue ſaide, that the aſhes of the eies of crabbes are rather bitter then ſharp, whoſe moiſture being conſumed and vapored away by hear, they are made drith and aſhes: whereby they get not 
                        •
                      ſharpe, but a bitter qualitie: and although an earthlie ſubſtance, yet thinne, by how much the bodie is made more

                        Simpl. 4. cap. 18.
                     Galen teacheth) whom at an other time you may better cō
                     ſult withall, leaſt you appeare plainly ignorant of your firſt principles. But becauſe I ſee ſome thinges muſt be pardoned you, go to, I willingly grant you that the calce of crabbes is ſharpe: but that with his ſharpnes, it doth increaſe the quartane, I vtterly deny. For I pray you (good Sir) is not Muſtard, Peper, and Garlike, ſo far forth granted vnto him that is ſicke of the quartane, by all the learned Greekes, Arabians and of Paul Aegineta himſelfe, that they are alſo preſcribed them for a diet. And the Diatrion Pipereon, or that they call Dioſpoliticon, are they not reckoned amongeſt the remedies for the quartane? neither is it beſides the purpoſe Lib. de febribus.to ſhew the words of the famous Phiſition Hollerius vppon this point, where he writeth of the diet of the ſicke of the quartane. As touching the diet (ſaith he) at the beginning of a mean matter, & by ſpaces frō the beginning to the force of the diſeaſe, you may vſe ſharpe thinges as muſtard, and ſalt meates, and after the force of the fitte the vſe of them is neceſſarie, towards the end he addeth. Therefore are ſalt meates commended, becauſe ſalt doth extenuat and driue away the excrementes, dryeth them vp, gathereth ſtrength and comforteth.
                  By this I thinke you and all other do ſufficiently perceiue how greatly you are deceaued in contemning our remedy taken out of the true doctrine of the learned. But becauſe you know not the other ſimples which are put into this medecine, or at the leaſt paſſe them ouer with ſilence, beholde I will gratify you and ſhew you the compoſition. It taketh the roote of Aron, or Cockow-pintell prepared, alſo the rootes of common Acorus, and Pimpinella, prepared and dried, the eies of the Crabbe calcyned (of which for one doſe, there is vſed not halfe a ſcruple) with ſemē naſtortij & ſuger a mixture is made of all. The doſe is one ſpoonful in the morning for to comfort the weake ſtomacke, to put away all

obſtructions of the bowels, and hardnes of the ſplene, an excellent medicine often proued, and at this day in vſe, with moſt learned Phiſitions. I thinke there is no Doctor wil ſay this to be ſo abſurd & hurtfull for the quartane. You ſhould therefore if you reproue Paracelſus medicines, haue choſen ſome other more ſpeciall thinges, wherein you might haue exerciſed the greatnes of your witte and proued your cunning. For theſe thinges (although you enuiouſly call them Theophraſticall) are both agreeable to reaſon, and to bee allowed of euery learned Phiſition. But peraduenture you will ſay theſe thinges haue not beene knowen to the diuine Hippocrates, nor vnto Galen, and therefore you will cōclude that they are to be reiected: but that is onely by your owne iudgement, and not by any reaſon, wee do not deſpiſe their excellent knowledge and diuine learning, neither violate their lawdable memory, when as we ſay they were the firſt that floriſhed in Phiſicke: yet therewithall we affirme that they had not tried all kinde of medecines, or knew the properties of them all. Life is ſhort ſaith Hippocrates, & this 
                        Aphor. 1.art which is occupied about this perillous practiſe is ouer long: Neither was Galen aſhamed to confeſſe where he writeth of Hydrargyrū, or quickeſiluer 9. of ſimp. cap. 19. that he had neuer made any tryall, neither that it would kill if it were eaten, neither if it were applyed outwardly: nor is it to bee thought that Theophraſtus was the firſt and onely inuenter of ſo many remedies, the knowledge whereof (he himſelfe confeſſeth in his bookes) he attained by the conference of diuerſe learned Philoſophers and Phiſitions, both Egyptians and Arabians, amongeſt whom for learning ſake, he remayned certaine yeares captiue, from whom at the length he brought away ſo many faire priſes of remedies, all which are takē partly out of the true oiles drawne of ſpices, herbes, fruites, flowers, and ſeedes, and theſſence of all laxatiues, whereof one drop will profit more, then ſo many drammes and ounces: which alſo (that they may worke by their whole ſubſtance) may bee ſowed and caſt vpon their proper ſalt, which in many may be done, as in other the earth is to bee caſt away as vtterly dead and contrary to purgation. Alſo

of diuers roſins, gummes, and other kindes of vegetables are drawen many faire and very profitable preparations: as alſo of diuers partes of ſundrie beaſtes, of which rightly prepared are made many verie holſome medicines, as by the true preparations of Mumia onely knowen vnto the Paracelſians is made a moſt laudable medecine in all peſtilent infections. Of the oile and ſalt of a mans ſcull not buried for the epilepſye: of the oile of honie and wax for the tophy: of greaſes and other preparations the better to mollify and diſſolue. So alſo of Muſke, Ciuet, Caſtoreum, the Vnicornes horne, Iuorie, the horne and bone of the Hart, of a Stagge, and infinite other thinges are made many extractions for the paines of the hart and ſuch like. Of all which the Chimicall art hath taught the true preparations which you do condemne. For the Paracelſian remedies are not onely taken out of the metalliyne bodies, perles, and pretious ſtones, as many fooliſhly thinke and perſwade the whole world: neither are they ſharpe and violent (as the ignorant and vnſkilfull prattle) but moſt ſweete and familier to our nature, which through the excellencie of the ſpirites they often preſerue, quicken and clenſe from all impurities onlie by ſweates: and finallie are not a little profitable by their whole ſubſtance, as many learned men daily (with great ſucceſſe) doe practice: but of theſe thinges more then enough. Therefore now we will goe forward to thoſe thinges which you write touching mettalles.
               
               
                  
                  A briefe anſweare of Ioſephus Quercitanus Armeniacus doctor of Phiſicke, to the expoſition of Iacobus Aubertus Vyndon. concerning the originall and cauſes of mettalles againſt the Chimiſtes.
                  
                     MANY write that mettell is a bodie to be digged vp by nature, either liquid, Agric. lib. 8. de natura foſſil.as quick-ſiluer, or hard, which may be molté with the heate of the fier, as gold, ſiluer copper, leade and tinne, or ſoftened as Iron. Other call all things that are digged out of the bowels of the earth by the proper name of mettalles. So Oneſicritus writeth that in Carmania there is a mettall of a red chalke. Herodotus affirmeth▪ that in Lybia about Atlantus, is a mettall of ſalt, and this doth Plinie teſtify in his 33. booke of his naturall hiſtorie. Others ſay that is proper mettall, which being molten is brought againe to his former forme, and that may be beaten out with hammer, is hard and apt to take impreſſion & for that cauſe they deuide it into ſix, that is, golde, ſiluer, copper tinne, leade, and Iron: whereunto ſome haue added mercurie, not that it is a mettall indeede, but it may be. The Chimiſtes vſe to call them by the names of the planets, not to referre their ſubſtance to the planets, as Aubertus fooliſhly thinketh: but partly moued with a certaine likenes of the greateſt and principall ſtarres (for which cauſe they named the two moſt perfect mettalles, the Sunne and Moone) and Iron for his hardnes, Mars, whom the Poets faine to be the God of armes and battell, and quickſiluer for the great and vncertaine motion they called Mercurie, and partly after the Pythagoreans, that they might hide their ſecrets vnder darke ſpeeches. But I ſee no reaſon why Antimony ſhould be properly receiued among mettalles (wherefore by Agricola his leaue, whoſe aucthoritie Aubertus leaneth

vnto) it is to be excepted out of their kinde, for that it is alltogether repugnāt to their definition: for all mettalles molten doe returne to their, proper forme, and ſuch as are eaſie to be driuen, be hard, and apt to receiue impreſſion: by which reaſon they differ from many liquable ſtones, in which the humiditie is not ſtrongly mixed with the dry earthines, as alſo from infinite kindes of marcaſites and halfe metalles. But Antymony molten doth vtterly looſe his firſt forme, as practiſioners doe daily trie, neither is it eaſye to be driuen, and practiſe ſheweth it will take no print, and therefore properly it cannot be called mettall. But it pleaſed Aubertus which is ſo learned in mettalles to affirme this, that yet he dreameth that tynne glaſſe (which is that Biſemutum, and that ſinder or aſhie kinde of leade whereof Agricola ſpeaketh much in the 8. booke de natura foſſil.) to be Stibium molten, and the Chimiſts, baſiliſke, which is moſt abſurd. For that tinne-glaſſe which is commonly called biſemutum, is not ſtibium any way prepared, neither the Chimiſtes baſiliſke, extract with tartar & niter, may be called biſemutum, which I leaue to the iudgement of al that be of vpright mindes: but this is ſmall to the purpoſe, when many thinges are called by the name of mettall, and yet not properly. But let vs pardon Aubertus in this which neuer ſaw any mines that he might iudge rightly of thē, neither vnderſtandeth the minde of Agricola. In the meane time hee complaineth that Chimiſtes deuide the metalles into perfect and vnperfect, and that he thinketh ridiculous for many cauſes. Firſt becauſe of a certaine diffinition giuen by Geber, which agreeth no leſſe to one mettall then an other: whereas the perfecte might be diſcried from the imperfect, one diffinition were to be giuen to the one an other to the other. As though the diffinition of a man were not agreeable to a child, although he be not yet come to a mans age: or in other accidentes ſeeme to differ from him, as mettals do differ among themſelues. So the diffinitions of white and red coralles ſhould be ſundrie and diuers, that by reaſon of abſolute and perfect concoctiō the white haue not attained the vttermoſt degree, whoſe definition notwithſtanding is all one. But Aubertus to

proue his opinion the better, writeth that all thinges, which haue eſſentiall forme (as it is certaine mettalles haue) muſt of neceſſitie be perfect. And that nature the godly parent of all thinges in doing of her office doth not ceaſe or reſt (except it be letted) vntill ſhe hath attained her purpoſed end and ſcope. He addeth that the matter whereof any naturall thing is made, and whereabout nature is occupied, doth moue ſo long vntill it hath attained the eſſentiall forme. He concludeth that mettall cannot rightly be deuided into perfect and vnperfect, neither that gold ought by any meanes to be called more excellent and perfect, although it be more bewtifull and temperat then other mettalles, all which wee muſt confute, as ſriuolous and vaine. And to proſecute all thinges in due order, we muſt ſhew that golde it ſelfe of the true Philoſophers is worthily called more perfect, excellent, and pure then other mettals: that hereuppon wee may conclude, mettalles not without reaſon to be deuided of the Chimiſtes into perfect and vnperfect. Therefore that I may alſo ſtay vpon the aucthoritie of Agricola (out of whom Aubertus hath ſpecially taken thoſe his wordes) he writeth in lib. 5. de ortu & cauſis ſubterraneorum, that mettalles do differ among themſelues, not onely in ſhining, but alſo in colour, ſauour, ſent, weight and power. And ſpecially ſpeaking of ſhining (which you Aubertus confeſſe to be in golde and ſiluer) he ſaith. But by how much the humor is more ſubtile, thicke and pure, by ſo much the mettall is more cleere and ſhining: for which cauſe in this behalfe gold excelleth the other. The excellencie of which gold Agricola himſelfe ſeeketh in the difference of ſent, ſauour, and waight. For the vnperfect mettalles, when they come in any liquor are perceiued to be ſower of taſte, as copper and Iron: for the aduſt earth is cauſe of their ſowernes, whereof thoſe mettalles do participat, as Agricola himſelfe witneſſeth. But the other becauſe of their pure earth, and more abundant water do not giue the liquors ſo ſenſible a ſauor, bur rather a ſweetiſh taſt, as gold and ſiluer. Alſo for as much as in gold the earth is moſt pure and verie wel tempered with his water, it giueth verie litle or ſcarſe ſenſible ſmoke when it is

burned, and rather ſweete then ſtinking. And Agricola addeth more that gold when it is purged in the fier hath in a maner no excremente▪ becauſe of his puritie, in others there is more, but ſo much more in one, then an other, as it is more vnpure. Alſo the excellency of golde is to bee ſought for in his force and ſtrength, becauſe that beſides it and ſiluer all other mettalles do vaniſh away in ſmoke, and periſh with the violence of fier vppon the teſt or cople: which happeneth vnto them, as the earth in them is found to be leſſe pure and their temperature not ſo good. As it hapneth vnto Iron through the impure earth, whereof there is great ſtore in it. But when as gold alone cannot bee conſumed 3. Meteor. cap. 6.with anie fierie heate, as Ariſtotle ſaith, and looſeth nothing of his waight though it bee burned or tried, of neceſſity it muſt haue a moſt pure earth, and well compact with his water, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that his earth doth hold and let his humor, that it vapour not away, and contrariwiſe the humour defendeth the earth, that it butne not (as ſaith Agricola) which commeth to paſſe, as others do affirme, becauſe of a moſt ſubtill, moiſt, and drye, that hath not any impuritie mixed. By this reaſon gold according to the nature of thinge▪ is purer then other mettalles, and ſurmounteth them in price, becauſe it is the moſt ſimple and pureſt mettall, and furtheſt from imperfection of elementes by reaſon of his forme. So Pliny ſaith, vnto one thing, which Lib. natu. hiſt. 33. cap. 3.
                     is golde, nothing decayeth by fier (as the Poet alſo ſaith) and as appeareth by that aforeſaid. By this we may gather, that amongeſt all mettalles, gold is not onely the brighteſt, but moſt temperat and perfect, in reſpect of which all other mettalles may worthely be called vnperfect. For nature alwaies tendeth to perfection, that is, to the making of golde, which alone amongeſt mettals is called perfect: for no agent naturall (as the Philoſophers ſay) ceaſeth from worke in his owne matter, neither is ſeperat, but with putting on ſome forme in that matter. Therefore ſo long as the agent is ioyned to the matter, or worketh vpon the matter, that is ſaid to be vnperfect: for the perfection of any thing is not but by putting on of forme. For ſo much then as in all

mettalles there is a certaine viſcous water, which the Chimiſtes Philoſophers call quickeſiluer, becauſe of the likenes which is put in place of the matter, and that which they call ſulphur by like ſimilitude of the agent or inducer of form in that matter: no mettall can bee called perfect, but that frō which the ſulphur is ſeparated, But becauſe other mettalles haue their ſulphur mixed in the matter, whereby they are killed, made blacke, calcined and burned (which happeneth vnto them onely by that dry exhalation, that is, the ſulphur becauſe it is a matter apt to be ſet on fire) for that cauſe they be altogether called vnperfect. But on the contrary part becauſe onely golde is altogether without this ſulphur, which the affinitie of gold and quickſiluer by it ſelfe doth ſufficiētly declare. (For as Pliny writeth, all things ſwimme vppon it but gold, which alone it draweth vnto it) Lib nat. hiſt. 33. cap. 6.
                     By this meanes it is free from corruption both in the fier & out of the fier, Of right therefore, it alone is called perfect, and formed according to the firſt and true intention of nature, and complete, becauſe it is come to the vttermoſt end wherein it is complete, and pure becauſe the agent is not mingled with the matter, but is ſeperat from it. To this purpoſe writeth Ariſtotle Met. 3. cap. vltimo ſpeaking of mettalles: wherefore ſaith he they conteine earth in them, and are all burned becauſe they haue a drye exhalation, But gold alone of all the reſt vſeth not to be burned. But Aubertus not content with theſe reaſons will anſweare: what ſo euer hath attained an eſſentiall forme, of neceſſity muſt bee perfect. But all mettalles haue their ſubſtantial forme. No man will deny (ſaith he) except it be ſome blockhead aſhes blower: and by that meanes hereupon concludeth, that all are perfect. But it is eaſy enough for vs to anſwere this obiection. For thoſe thinges which perſeuer in their nature are called perfect in their kinde through their ſubſtantiall forme: but ſome continue by nature in their kinde, which notwithſtanding are made perfect by ſome meanes through their ſubſtantiall forme, to the which their is a certaine motion and end: but becauſe they are carried to another later eſſentiall forme, which altogether finiſheth the matter


it ſelfe, and maketh it complet: therfore they are called vnperfect▪ ſo long as they remaine vnder that firſt forme, in reſpect of the later, to the attaining whereof they do endeuor themſelues. But if no accompt be made of that later forme, but they be conſidered onely in themſelues: they are truely perfect in that their kinde (through their eſſentiall forme) as that kinde doth require. This all men ſee in the generation of egges, in which there is a certaine determined motion in the getting of his ſubſtantiall forme, which doth ſo remaine. But becauſe thoſe egges are by nature ordeined to this end, not to remaine vnder that forme, but to bring forth a byrde, and ſo is made the begetting of the latter ſubſtantiall forme: Therefore egges are called vnperfect vnder the forme of an egge: but it is a perfect thing after the bringing forth of a birde, for that is the laſt ende of egges. This is likewiſe to be iudged of mettalles, which albeit they haue in their kinde gotten an eſſentiall forme, yet can they not be called perfect, in reſpect of gold, which alone is ſaid to bee perfect, vntill they come to that laſt & perfect end, that is, to the perfection of golde, and become golde. And like as in the generation of the Embrio, there is compariſon of the vegetable ſoule to the ſenſible and of the ſenſible to the rationall, and not as formes ſo other imperfect mettalles are in reſpect of gold. Therefore the Chimiſticall Philoſophers haue worthily deuided the mettalles into perfect and vnperfect. For although the difference of mettalles be in the forme it ſelfe, yet ſhall it not be properly the difference of the kindes, as the difference of man and horſe, but ſhall be taken more properly of the matter, & his partes that is according as it is digeſted or vndigeſted, complete or incomplete, ſeeing thoſe are altogether of one proper matter. But indigeſt and incomplete is ſpoken in reſpect of gold. But whereas Aubertus judgeth Iron more noble then golde, becauſe it ſerueth more to the vſe man, I thinke he ſhall neuer perſwade any Phiſitions (be they neuer ſo vnlearned) which rather deſire to catch gold then Iton. But I ſuppoſe there is ſuff
                        •
                     ciently ſpoken touching the excellencie and perfection of gold: and becauſe we ſaid that

mettalles are of one proper matter, although not in all alike digeſted, herein conſiſteth the point of the queſtion, therefore we muſt now come to ſeeke out that matter of mettalles. The Philoſophers make two cauſes of mettals, as alſo of all other mixed bodies. The one generall and far of, which is taken of the elements, as of the firſt cauſes of all things, of which they cōſiſt, as of moſt ſimple, & are reſolued againe as into moſt ſimple. The Peripatecians contende againſt the Stoickes, that onely the qualities and vertues of the elementes doe paſſe one into another, and altogether mingled. The Stoickes contrarily doe affirme that whole ſubſtances are mingled with the whole: but leauing theſe waues of ſlipperie opinions we will goe to the ſafe and quiet port. And in this point we do allow the opinion of Aubertus, who thinketh the elementes not to be mixed bodies eſſentially, or in deede, but in power, which Galen witneſſeth in the firſt book, de methodo medendi, where he writeth that the elements are to be mingled wholly with the whole, onely by their qualities. Of the ſecond or proper matter of mettalles, the opinion of many Philoſophers is not agreeable, but very diuers. For ſome ſaid the neereſt matter of mettals is a moiſt breath, as Ariſtotle: & ſome hold it to be a water drawē from other elementes, which Agricola alloweth, whoſe opinion our Aubertus agreeth vnto. Other deeme it aſhes moiſtened with water. But the Chimiſt whoſe opinion Aubertus goeth about to ouerthrow, ſaith quickſiluer is the matter of them: ſome haue ioyned ſulphur: all which opinions are breefly and diligently to be examined by vs, that the matter may bee more euident, and that all men may vnderſtand how vnworthely Aubertus & others haue inue

                        3 met. cap. vltimo.philoſophers aſſineth a double matter of thoſe things which are made within and vppon the earth, by the ſupernaturall power and force, that is a breath and a vapour, by the mixture whereof, in the bowelles of the earth h

They are called foſſilia, becauſe they are digged out of the earth, and like vnto the earth that is digged, neither are they liquable, as all kind of ſtones which are made of a dry exhalation ſet on fier, and with the heate conſuming the moiſture, and in a manner burning it. The other ſort are metallyne, whereof ſome are fuſible and liquable, becauſe they draw neerer to the nature of moiſture, then of drith, as leade and tinne, and are ſo called becauſe they are eaſelier molten then beaten. On the contrary, thoſe that are to be beaten, which are molten with greater difficulty, as Iron, whoſe next matter is a vaperous breath congealed by cold, and groweth into mettall according to the opinion of Ariſtotle, whom our Aubertus thinketh worthy to be reprooued: For ſaith he, it cannot come to paſſe in the nature of things that there may be a paſſage from one extreame or contrary into an other without any meane: for it is euident that mettalles and breathes are of contrary qualities, for theſe are very ſubtill, and the other very groſe. Hereupon he concludeth in the originall of mettalles, breathes and vapoures Lib▪ 
                        5. de ortu & cauſis ſub

                        er.doe of neceſſitie firſt congeale into humors before they harden into mettalls. This did he take out of Agricola: but that excellent learned man, Iacobus Scheggius in his cō
                     mentaries vpon Ariſt. Meteors, doth ſufficiently defend Ariſtotle, being vnworthily reproued, where he teacheth, that the breath or vapor whereof water commeth is one. & that whereof mettalles concreteth is an other, as alſo that wherof a ſtorme groweth another: for it is ſometime more ponderouſe and groſſe then that whereof water groweth. By which reaſon they propoſe a further diſtant matter of mettalles which ſay it is water, thē they which ſay it is a breath, when as the greateſt part of meteors do growe vpon theſe breathes and vaperous matters raiſed vp out of the water and earth by the force of heate: for ſo much as there is no fertility of the water or earth without heat: for heate doth procre at theſe two as a firſt childe in whoſe nature the force of the parentes (that is of the foure elementes) is repreſented, and as it were an ingendring power of them doth conſent together, two qualities working by a maſculine force,

the other two ſuffering as feminine. But either of them obaying the celeſtiall temperature as their father, whereby theſe thinges without life are accuſtomed to be procreat, by the inſtrument of the firſt qualities. And this may be perceaued by the verie ſence, that ſo groſſe vapors do often breake out in places vnder the ground that the diggers can not take breath, and ſometimes through the groſenes therof as Galen witneſſeth, are choked. If they be ſo groſſe, who will iudge that mettalles and breathes, are of contrary qualities, but that they may grow into a ſound matter of mettalles, without any other meane, as the ponderous vapor doth into a ſtorme? Furthermore (as multitudes of people can teſtify) if it hath rained copper and Iron, and that ſtones and ſuch other bodies do grow and are made in the vppermoſt aire, how ſhould theſe be engendred of water, & earth, for whom there is no place to tarrie in the aire, rather then of vapour and breath, which both can pearce & ſtay there for their thinnes and heate. Wherefore it is certaine that mettalles rather haue their originall of breath then of water: which breath becauſe it is groſſe, doth alſo eaſely congeale. But what needeth more of this, when it is manifeſt to all Philoſophers that all thinge haue their originall of that whereunto they may at laſt be reduced, For all mettalles (except the two perfect) which by greater decoction haue their matter more compact and fixed, are they not reduced into a breath of vapor? & in the examinatiō of the teſt or cople do they not vaniſh away into ſmoke? Yes truly into ſmoke, which is not turned into water, or moiſteneth, but groſſe becauſe of the earthines mixed with it, being cōgeled & thickned with cold, which by certain experience may daily be ſeene & perceaued of thoſe which work in fier and more eaſily alſo of the Philoſophers in their ſublimations. The ſame doth Tutia, Cadmia and Pompholix with other ſuch like prooue, which comming of the vapoures of mettalles ſticke to the walles of the furnaces, and ſhew them to be groſſe in the mines, neither do repreſent water by any meanes.

opinion, neither let him iudge raſhly of things which he knoweth not, but credit thoſe which haue experience, & know thoſe vapors to bee moſt thicke, whereof mettals are firſt congealed, and without any other meane hardned. But hauing ouerthrowen Ariſtotle, let vs ſee what iudgement he will giue of other lerrned men and Philoſophers, as of Albertus magnus, Geber, and other Collars (for by that name this our noble cenſor adorneth thoſe excellent men) whoſe opinions Aubertus refelleth in this point, becauſe they ſay, that quickſiluer and ſulphur is the next matter of mettalles, and goeth about with certeine arguments to ſhew, how they are out of the way. Firſt touching quickſiluer, he ſaith, it is not likely to be the propper matter of mettalles, becauſe it can not congeale into hardnes: ſurely an excellent argument and worthy to bee often repeated of the author, whereunto notwithſtanding he is anſwered by vs before the ſaith it can not congeale▪ becauſe it is of an airy ſubſtance. But the vapor which we concluded out of Ariſtotle, to be the next matter of mettalles, who will not confeſſe to be airy in reſpect of water, and notwithſtanding who will denie but it may cō
                     geale? then I confeſſe that quickſiluer is airy: and therefore many Philoſophers iudge it not to be a mettall but onely in Power: but I do call it ſo to bee airy, that it ſendeth forth a moſt groſſe vapour, which by colde congealeth, as may bee ſeene in Mercurie

                      not put on the forme of mettalles: ther fore


their matter can not bee quickſiluer, for ſo much as it can not congeale to hardnes. But this argument is no more effectuall then the former: For he ſetteth downe as graunted that which he hath not by any means prou
                        •
                     d, and which we haue alreadie denyed: for we graunted vnto him that quickſiluer was of an a

                     rie ſubſtance, but that it cannot therfore congeale, wee deny, when contrary to his minde we haue ſhewed his vapors do congeale. And truly Aubertus doth not deny but by art it doth harden, but hee thinketh that neither by art or nature it may congeale into mettalle in hardnes or forme, as thoughe to thinke, were to demonſtrate a thing. Therefore he denyeth quickſiluer to be the matter of mettalles: the cauſe which he alledgeth, that it is of an airy ſubſtance, is of no force. For wee haue ſhowed out of Ariſtotle, that it is a vapour of an airy ſubſtance in reſpect of water, and neuertheleſſe the next matter of mettals. Therefore airy thinges are to bee diſtinguiſhed: for ſuch as are altogether and ſimply airy becauſe of the predominant matter cannot be coagulated neither by heat or by cold, becauſe their airie moiſture cannot bee dryed vp, the earth w

                     nting, by which reaſon alſo they ſwimme vpon the water, witneſſe Ariſtotle as oile, and are eaſily ſet on fire, becauſe it is matter of fire, as oile it ſelfe and wooddes which ſwimme vpon the water, except ebenum which is more earthly, as by his waight may be iudged: but quickſiluer is neither ſet on fire, neither matter of fire, but moſt contrary vnto it like water, neither is it light but ponderous, that in it the ſoū
                     deſt boddies of all mettalles will ſwimme vpon golde onely except for the great affinitie of them both, whereby it appeareth, that it is of an other ſubſtance, then ſimply aire like oile. Therefore to the ſimilitude of this quickſiluer, the next matter of mettalles: the Chimicall Philoſophers haue ſaid, that this quickſiluer is ingendred of a ſtrong commixtion of the firſt matter of all mettals, that is of a moiſt viſcous incombuſtible humour, incorporat with a ſubtill earth, equally and ſtrongly mixed by ſmall partes in the minerall caues of the earth. Vnto this wiſe nature (becauſe the matter bringeth not it ſelfe to effect) ioyneth his proper agent, that

is ſulphur, which is nothing elſe then a certaine fatneſſe of the earth engendred in the proper mines, and by temperat decoction thickned, that it may turne the quickſiluer by digeſtion, and concoction into forme of mettall. Therefore this ſulphur is to the quickſiluer as the man to the woman, and as the proper agent to the proper matter. Not that this quickſiluer and ſulpur (as ſome fooliſhly thinke) are found by themſelues in their nature in the mines, but that theſe are alreadie mingled by nature, and by longe concoction brought into the nature of earth. And this truly is the ne

                     reſt matter of mettalles, as in the generation of man meate is neerer matter then the elements, the blood neerer then meate, and the ſperme neerer then blood it ſelfe: and at laſt by apt digeſtion the matter receiueth the ſhape of a man. So when as it is ſaid, that mettals are firſt made of the foure elements, as of their generall and firſt matter: the ſame order kept, it is neceſſarie that of thoſe elements come vapours, of vapours a ſlimie water (which is yet a neerer matter thē the vapors, leſt by defending Ariſtotle, Aubertus may thinke mee to gainſay my ſelfe) and heauy, mingled with a ſubtile ſulphureous earth which is called quickſiluer: of which as of a neerer matter by meane of the mixture and working of the outward ſulphur is made gold or other mettall according to the great or leſſer digeſtion of nature. For as the Philoſopher writeth Metaph. 6. when any thing is ſaid to be made of another, either an extreme & perfect, is made of a meane and vnperfect, as of a childe, a man, or elſe an extreme▪ of extreme, as aire of water: but let vs returne to our Aubertus. He writeth that ſulphur alſo can not bee the matter of mettalles. But let vs heare by what reaſons he doth proue it. Sulphur, ſaith he, according to Ariſtotle, is ingendred of a hot, drie, and vnctuous breath, but mettals are ingendred of an other breath hot and moiſt, and a litle vnctuous. Truly a goodly, but ſophiſticall argument, by which he goeth about to proue his purpoſe, by the opinions which he hath already impugned, Let him therefore remember that he before hath affirmed againſt Ariſtotle, that breath was not the matter of mettalles: and now he doth confeſſe that

mettalles are ingendred of breaths. Therefore he ſpeaketh againſt himſelfe, that he ſhall not neede my refutation: hee addeth to proue his opinion, that ſulphur waxeth ſoft with moiſture like ſalt, and that mettalles are molten only with ſtrong fire: but of a falſe antecedent can not follow a good conſequent. For by no meanes is ſulphur diſſolued into water, but by heat is molten like leade: and this ſhould our ſearcher of thinges vnder ground firſt haue tryed, then to affirme ſo boldl

                     e that which is falſe. Therefore that dart may be bent againſt him wherewith hee ſuppoſed to haue wounded 
                        •
                     he Chimiſtes. Alſo he ſaith, that ſulphur is of an airy and fi

                     ie ſubſtance, and therefore can not bee increaſed or congealed. But I haue afore ſhewed the contrary, wherfore he is not to looke for any other anſweare of me, becauſe he hath neither reproued my argument, neither made any demonſtration of his opinion by firme reaſons. But this one thing ſufficeth, that all wiſe Chimiſtes do affirme, that this which they call ſulphur, is not the common ſulphur which burneth with combuſtion of blacknes and aduſtiō & is burned: whereas their proper ſulphur doth whiten, rubify, coagulat, and finally make perfect that Chimicall quickeſiluer which is commonly vnknowen into the ſubſtance of golde, according to nature, or of the philoſophers ſtone, and gold according to art. And this is the true ſecret ſulphur, and the onely tincture and ſhadow of the ſonne and the proper congeler of his quickſiluer which the Philoſophers haue ſhadowed with diuers names their dark ſpeeches and enigmaes▪ whereby it appeareth Aubertus to haue farre erred, and by all meanes to bee refuſed, becauſe he ſpeaketh of a ſulphur which he knoweth not: and that the Chimick Philoſophers are not to be blamed becauſe they ſay quickſiluer and ſulphur to be the matter of mettalls, which do not vnderſtand it of the common quickſiluer & ſulphur. For they know that theſe things whereof they ſpeake are not founde in the mettal mines in their verie nature: but o
                        •
                      thoſe two they ſay, there is made a third mixture, hauing the natures, properties & vertues of them, that of it may be engendred, any mettall according to the diuerſitie of the compoſition,

digeſtion and place. Theſe ſhall ſuffice touching the next matter of mettalles which Aubertus would haue to be water wrought vpon by the other elements, but he hath kept ſilēt the cauſe why he thinketh ſo being contented to ſay that it is ſet forth by others, or that he hath found it in other mens writings, which is the ſaying of a man that will proue his opinion by an other mans credit, and not by reaſon, as the true Philoſophers doe. But now the efficient cauſes call vs which the Philoſophers make double and ſo many paſſiōs. for heat and cold are called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , becauſe they haue power to moue: moiſt and drie 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for becauſe they rather ſuffer any thing then worke, and are ſaid to be wrought vpon of the firſt qualities, as of the moſt noble and higher in nature, by whoſe worke forme is ingendred in thinges: for the matter is not knowen by it ſelfe, but by the chaunge which cannot be without ſuffering, as neither that without touching, the which by coniunction, and cogelation, and by introduction of act and forme is aboliſhed. But it is to be obſerued that by the mixture of drie and moiſt the bodies are firſt called congealed, then harde or ſoft: of which congealed bodies there is a triple difference? for it is either a watrie humor that is congealed, or ſome dry earthly thing, or a mixture of them both. Alſo theſe, ſome of them are molten, ſome dried, ſome moiſtened, and ſome made ſoft. But thoſe thinges which are drye and fierie, as hony and muſt, will neuer be congealed, and they which are moiſt & airie predominant as all oily thinges. Wherefore theſe alſo are not elements, neither the matter of theſe ſufferinges. But of bodies which doe congeale and are hardened according to Ariſtotle, ſome are affected by heate and ſome by cold: by heate drying vp the humor, by cold driuing out the heate▪ Therefore thoſe thinges that are congealed by heat by want of moiſture are diſſolued of cold, which maketh the moiſture to enter in againe as ſalt. And thoſe thinges which for lacke of heate are congealed, are diſſolued againe by heate, entring in againe as mettals: for whatſoeuer is diſſolued melting, is molten either by fire or water. Whatſoeuer melteth by water muſt needes be congealed by hot &

drie, that is, fiery heate: and thoſe which fier melteth, or whoſe congelacion in any part it doth diſſolue (as horne) are congealed by colde, for of contrarie effectes the cauſes be contrarie: and becauſe that mettalles do melt by heat, it is of neceſſitie that firſt they were congealed by cold, as the efficient cauſe, whereof none of the Chimiſt philoſophers doth doubt, although, as Ariſtotle ſome time ſaith, experience ſheweth vs the contrary: for ſalt is congealed by heate, and may bee diſſolued and molten by fier as I haue often tried, and it is called fuſible ſalt. Neither Albertus Magnus that great Philoſopher ought to be reprehended of our Aubertus becauſe he referreth the power of making mettalles vnto heate, when as Albertus doth not meane it of only heat, as he thinketh. Therefore it is to be knowen, as Ariſtotle witneſſeth thinges by meanes of colde to ſuffer rather then to worke, becauſe that cold is proper to the patient elements, that is water and earth, which both by nature are cold. For they do not receiue cold from any other thing as they do heate, but by taking away the heat they coole of their owne nature, neither are they cooled by any externall cauſe, as the aier and fier. Wherfore albeit cold in mixed thinges hath an efficient force, yet it preuaileth rather to corruption then to generation, Therefore the Chimiſts are not to be reprooued, although they ſay that nature needeth a heat vnder the earth for the procreatiō of mettals, as a more effectuall efficient cauſe which may mingle, alter, diſpoſe, digeſt, and concoct their matter, & at laſt with long tract of time frame it into gold as into his laſt end. Neither are they to be reproued in this that they refer ſome force to the influēce of the heauenly bodies: for Ariſtotle 
                     
                        •
                     onfirmeth their opinion in his booke de coelo & mundo and his booke of the cauſes of the properties of elements in theſe wordes. For ſaith he the firſt beginnings mouing to generation, and inducing forme in euery thing are the ſtarrie and heauenlie bodies, by their mouing and light. For they are the firſt that moue, moued of the intelligences to performe the nature of generation or corruption for the preſeruation of kindes, and of them is giuen forme and perfection, and as hee ſaid


in an other place: the ſonne and man engendreth man▪ nether doth Aubertus rightly conclude vppon this reaſon, the art of Alchemy to be vaine, if mettalles bee ingendred by force of the ſtarres, when as the Chimiſte s can not haue the fruition of this heauenly power: for they beleeue with the Philoſopher, that if formes bee put on vppon inferiour thinges by the motion and light of the heauenly bodies, & by their ſite and aſpect, the ſame by conſequent to come to paſſe in mettalles, but that is done as it were by a generall cauſe and farre off: but they haue a neerer efficient cauſe, as we ſaid that is heate, by force whereof mettalles congealed in the bowels of the earth are diſpoſed, digeſted & made perfect. Theſe thinges thus declared, we muſt ſee to what end Aubertus tendeth and what is his vttermoſt ſcope, hee would haue the labour of the Chimiſtes, which they take vpon them in making perfect of mettalles to be vtterly vaine and loſt, and he denyeth that copper, tinne, Iron or leade, (which of them are called vnperfect mettalles) can by any art be made perfect, and be turned into gold and ſiluer. And firſt ſaith hee, it is euident thoſe foure mettalles to bee perfect: but we haue before ſhewed they are altogether vnperfect for many cauſes, neither can it be denied but that by art and right preparation they are made much more perfect and excellent in their kinde. Therefore Ariſtotle 4. met. cap. 6. Iron ſaith hee, wrought is molten that it becommeth moiſt and congealeth againe: and no otherwiſe are they accuſtomed to make ſteele, for the fex of the Iron ſetleth and is ſeperat into the bottom: and when it is after made pure and cleane from his forces it becommeth ſteele: but Iron is ſo much the better as it hath leaſt excrements. But let vs paſſe ouer authorities, when we haue ſufficiently approued this by philoſophicall reaſons, by which we haue more then ſufficiently ſhewed onely gold to be perfect, all other mettalles to be vnperfect. Moreouer Aubertus addeth, that he might make the art of tranſmutatiō vnpoſſible. Thoſe things which are ma
                        •
                     e perfect and formed by art are artificiall, but mettalles both by knowledge of the name and diffinition of the eſſence are naturall, for they are mineralles ſaith he and

haue their originall onely from a naturall beginning, therefore they are naturall, and that according to Ariſtotle. For naturall thinges haue the beginning of their making in thē
                     ſelues. but thoſe which are made by art, not: but haue it outwardly from ſome other▪ and brieflie to end, hee addeth that no naturall forme can bee put on by art, whereby hee concludeth that there can be no artificiall mettalles. Now therfore goe too, it is our part to ouerthrow theſe argumēts, and finally to proue the Chimick art to be true, which imitating nature it ſelfe doth tranſmute mettalles, we ſaid before they were called vnperfect, which were in motion to that forme whereunto they were laſt decreed, and thoſe perfect, which haue attained the end of their motion. And becauſe gold is come to the vttermoſt terme of his motion, & is formed according to the true intent of nature as we haue alreadie ſhewed: therefore we hane concluded that alone to be perfect, and all othe
                        •
                      that be in their motion to the forme of gold to be vnperfect, whoſe perfection notwithſtanding nature doth ſtill proſecute in her boſome that ſhe might conuert them, although in long time into golde. This can the diggers of mettalles teſtify which in one hundred waight of lead finde certaine ounces of fine ſiluer, which is their great gaine. So alſo in many copper mines there is found gold: and likewiſe in ſiluer mines, which when as ſuch as are ſkilfull of theſe thinges perceiued, or as often as they found any vnperfect ſiluer through indigeſtiō, they vſe to ſhut vp their mines, and prouide that they be ſo let alone for 30. yeares or more vntill there bee made a perfect concoction by the heate vnder the earth. So alſo writeth Plinius, that there Hiſt. lib. 33 cap. 4.
                     is ſiluer in golde by diuers waight, in ſome the tenth part, ſome nine, and ſome eight. In one onely mettall ſaith Galen, which they call Albi
                           •
                        rarenſe, the 26, part is found, and therfore it is more excellent then other, becauſe it is according to the greater or leſſe digeſtion of nature, as may be iudged▪ For when as digeſtion is complete, then is found moſt pure and perfect gold. Whereby it appeareth that albeit mettals be in a certaine terme of motion, yet not to bee in the laſt, and that they are in the way and paſſage to gold, as to that

                     Hiſt. lib. 33. cap. 6.
                      which is only perfect. For where any vaine of mettal is found neere therto is alſo foūd another: wherupon after Pliny they are called mettals of the Greeks 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      that one is ſounde after another. But Aubertus wil ſay to this. If vnperfect mettals by longer decoctiō may be reduced into gold by nature, why do not the diggers expect that time, ſpeciallie ſeeing, if that ſhould come to paſſe, they ſhould haue much greater gaine by the thing: we anſwere there are certaine things which make the generation of mettalles diuers not onely in kinde but in properties and accidents, according to the regions and places where they grow, as alſo beaſtes are made diuers, as writeth Ariſtotle 6. de animalibus. For in Egipt Scorpions are not venemouſe, in other places contrary: and wheat in time & in ſome places doth degenerate into rye, & rye into wheat: So is to be ſaid of mettalles which although they be appointed of nature vnto their end, that is that they ſhould be gold, notwithſtanding by the diuerſity of Regions and mines and their corruption ſome are brought to their degree of perfection that they become golde, and ſome remaine in the path of imperfection according to the diuerſitie of digeſtion or purifying: For by weaker heate nature doth congeale ſome vndigeſted thinges as lead and tinne, & ſome with a ſuperfluous and burning heate, as copper and Iron, and ſome contrariwiſe for want of heate and lacke of an agent doth not congeale as quickſiluer. But nature it ſelfe bringeth forth ſiluer with a reaſonable temporat heate, but gold with a moſt temperate which needeth no workemanſhip to be made perfect, as that hath attained the vttermoſt end and accompliſhment. For as Ariſtotle ſaith in his 2. booke de Coelo & mundo: that onely is good accompliſhment that needeth no labour to make it good, and all perfection of thinges conſiſteth in this point, that they receiue their laſt accompliſhment, For ſo much then as the vnperfect mettals haue not attained to that laſt ende of perfection for the cauſes aforeſaid: therefore they lacke the worke of art, by whoſe help following nature it ſelfe, they are at length made perfect, and attaine that laſt end whereunto they were ordeined of nature, that is they become golde. For as the

Philoſopher writeth 2. Ethicor. truely ſometime art maketh perfect ſome things which nature cannot worke, other ſome it doth follow. So nature being holpen by art, trees bring forth their flowers and fruites euen in the winter ſeaſon, and in cold countries, which nature of it ſelfe could not do, as is to be ſeene in the county palatines orchard at Hedelberge, and in many other places: but that which Aubertus ſaith, that in the whole work of Alchemy nature doth vtterly reſt, and onely art doth moue the ſubiect, it is moſt falſly ſpoken: for by reaſon of nature being agent Chymia is a naturall worke, for the matter in the ſelfe ſame ſtone which by decoction it deſireth, retaineth, digeſteth, expelleth, corrupteth, engendreth, and formeth in his time by the commandement of almightie God, wherewith nature doth forme mettalles by the mixture of it: but by reaſon of the miniſterie I confeſſe Chimia to be an artificiall worke, not that art doth corrupt engender and forme, but thus farre onely that it miniſtreth all this vnto natures working, which otherwiſe of it ſelfe it could not alone performe: for nature worketh two manner of waies to engender golde: one by it ſelfe: and firſt of all when it doth engender gold in his proper mines, and of his proper beginninges, in which it is vnpoſſible for art to imitate nature. Secondly it worketh by it ſelfe but not firſt, becauſe firſt it engendreth ſome vnperfect mettall of the ſame beginninges in his mine: and laſtly conuerteth it into gold, in which point art followeth nature it ſelfe, in that of vnperfect mettalles it maketh gold as nature it ſelfe doth. Hereby it is euident ſomething to be made of ſomething: two manner of waies mediatly and immediatly. For according to Ariſt. lib 9. Meta. There may be many matters of one thing, as mediat and immediat: albeit at the laſt the mediat matter muſt bee reduced into the immediat, for otherwiſe of diuerſe matters diuers thinges would riſe. Therfore becauſe art taketh both the mediat & immediat matter which nature doth, & reduceth the mediat at the laſt to the immediat as nature alſo doth, & hath one and the ſelfe ſame agent which ſhall ſpoile the quickſiluer, and at laſt tranſforme it, and the end of art and nature is all one, that is by the

vniting of this forme with his matter, at laſt to ingender gold: there is no doubt, but that art imitating nature it ſelfe in all pointes can make an vnperfect mettall a perfect, as nature it ſelfe doth make, as we haue aforeſaid. Wherefore the cauſes being all one, of neceſſitie they alſo muſt be one, and bring forth the like effectes. Neither do I thinke them to be excuſed which ſeeke the ſubiect of the Chymick Philoſophers in the vegitalles. Their lahour is in vaine, for there can be no generation but by the neereſt, conuenient and immediates, Others haue beſtowed their labors vpon animall thinges, ſpecially in an egge, becauſe the Chimick Philoſophers moued with a certaine ſimilitude of egges called their worke the egge, and ſaid that the egge euen as the Elixir doth conteine 4 elements, whoſe ſhell they called the earth, the thinne ſkinne the aire, the white water, and the yelke fier. So alſo the ſame Philoſophers by a darke ſpeech ſaid, their ſtone was one in three, and three in one, becauſe it conteineth in it a bodie that ſtandeth, a ſoule that g
                        •
                     ueth life, and a ſpirit that ſtaineth. They which vnderſtand not theſe darke ſpeeches, perſwaded themſelues that an egge was the Philoſophers ſtone, becauſe it conteined three in one, the ſhell, the yelke, and the water: and therefore at laſt concluded the egge to be the onely matter ſought for by the Chim

They alſo erre which think to take gold for the man and ſiluer for the woman: which two they amalgame (for we may vſe the words of the art) with common mercurie, & of three make one, which they decoct chyminically, ſublyme: and out of it at laſt drawe the ſpirit, which afterward they goe about to fix. For they depart from the philoſophers writinges which confeſſe all with one mouth, that the agent is ioyned and proportionat by nature in the mines with his owne matter, and they ſay, that it is but one thing wherein are the foure elementes well proportioned, that there is the

Notwithſtanding their diuiſion is neceſſarie, that they all might be the eaſilier changd amongeſt themſelues, and therewith part by paſſing into water wax blacke, and the water by paſſing into airie wax white, and the aire be

                        Coniunctio 4 The ſeparation of elements made, they make a coniunction of water & earth with aire and fire keeping a proportion that euery element may be diſperſed with other, & giue vnto the male 3. partes of his water, and vnto the women ix. parts then euery like reioyceth with his like, for the deſire of the ioyning ſpecially of the materiall & ſulphureouſe forme.

nothing borne or groweth, nor without life, but firſt things putrifaction is made.
                  
                     
                        Coagulatio 6 After putrefaction they come to coagulation, and with the ſame moſt temperat heate continually altering the matter, as well inwardly as outwardly, they do worke vntill all the matter be white like vnto pearles, then is there a true fixing and congealing of the ſhining ſpirites with the bodies The Chimick philoſophers call this the white thorne, and white ſulphur incombuſtible, which neuer departeth from the fier.
                  
                     
                        Cibatio. 7 Finally they proceede vnto Cibation, that is, to the making thicke of the thinne, and making ſubtile the groſſe mingling his water with the aſhes, and his milke with the foliat earth: but moderatly that ſo the whitenes and rednes, goodnes, quantitie and vertue of it may increaſe and grow, and by decocting and decocting againe, the matter might be nouriſhed.

                        Formeutatio. 9 Hauing finiſhed the ſublimation, they leuen the water by ioyning the ſpirit with his whitened earth or calce, as with his ferment, or incorporating the ſoule with the bodie. For the ſpirituall accidentes cannot ſhew their permanent qualities, except they be ioyned with fixed bodies, as with his leuen, which bringeth vnro him his aptnes to his nature, colour and ſauour by the mutuall and common impreſſion of the bodie, and ſpirit, without the which the worke can not bee finiſhed, as paſte cannot be leuened without leuen.
                  
                     
                        Exaltatio. 10 But for the greater nobilitie of the matter, they thinke it muſt be exalted by increaſing the ſpirit, and ſublyming & making ſubtil the earth by naturall, rectifying of all the elements, and the true circulation and graduation of them vntill they be brought to a perfect

ſo contrarie. Further more we haue ſhewed the Philoſophers ſtone to be naturall, by reaſon of his making, and that by meanes of the naturall agent, that is fier, with his naturall colour ſent, and forme, which are accidentall formes, following his determinat ſubſtantiall forme, art miniſtring matter vnto it. For art is ioyned with nature, for the beginning of art is nature it ſelfe, as the philoſopher writeth 2. phiſic.

Neither is it any new thing, that art in many points followeth nature, and that many naturall thinges are made by art, which Ariſt. affirmeth 4▪ 
                     Metaph. ſpheaking of colchota and calchant. For nature, ſaith hee) in the mines of Atraments engendreth Atraments, and he ſheweth the manner of the making. And a little after hee ſaith, the two atraments may be made and compounded by art: for art being the follower of nature, as he writeth 2. Metaph. by taking the ſubſtance of Iron or copper (whereof naturally they are made) miniſtring it vnto nature, with often diſſolutions, diſtillations and coagulations doth ſo perfectly and ingeniouſly make them, that they haue the ſame properties and operations actiue & paſſiue that the two mineral attraments haue. The like is ſeene in making of ſalt. There is ſome minerall ſalt founde, as in Polonia, other ſome is made, as in France, yet hauing the ſame properties and paſſions as the minerall, by which reaſon it may be called verie naturall, and his forme alſo naturall and verie perfect. The like is to be thought of mettals, for as the want of proper matter is the cauſe chiefly, why that of euery thing an other the like is not ingendred: ſo if fit matter be found out, it is the chiefe cauſe why that of one another the like is ingendred. Therefore for ſo much as it is poſſible for the art of tranſmutation to finde out the


ſame matter of gold and ſiluer which is altogether naturall, that is that third nature, the quickſiluer coagulat and mixed with his ſulphur, and that it is eaſie to follow and imi

It followeth both on the behalfe of the agent, and of the proper and naturall matter, the art may be called poſſible and truely naturall: but at the length Aubertus will flye to this argument. If this Philoſophers ſtone could iuduce the ſhape of ſiluer and golde, it would make it like vnto it ſelfe, and by that meanes frame another Philoſophers ſtone. I anſwere, this conuerſion of mettalles is the reducing of them vnto a certaine meane, that is, to a temperature, and that excellent equallitie (which is onely found in gold) in ſubſtance colour digeſtion, fuſion, ſound and other properties. Theſe hetherto diſputed ſhall ſuffice, not that I would take away any thing from Aubertus eſtimation in other pointes, but to ſhew him and ſuch as thinke his little booke to bee adorned with tauntes, that they haue vſed their ſharpe tauntes againſt ſuch as haue not deſerued.

Amongeſt the mineralls gold only is moſt temperate and perfect, the which being brought in to thin leaues, is miniſtred by all the Greeke and Arabian phiſitions, to ſtrengthen nature againſt the paſſions of the hart, vnto ſuch as are much addited to ſadnes, and againſt all melancholy diſeaſes, as we haue ſhewed in another place. Wherefore they preſcribe it in their electuaries of pearles, and in laeticia Galeni (although ſome thinke it falſly aſcribed vnto Galen) in their Antidote of Coccus baphicus, otherwiſe called alkermes, in Aurea Alexandrina of Nicolas Mirepſi, and in his Analeptike electuarie: In their diamargariton of Auicen his deſcription & many other medicines, All which according to their nature and qualitie do exhilerate the hart, ſubdue melancholy and frenſies, reſtore the ſpirites, and ſtrength decayed: and this they vſe to giue without any other preparation.

Firſt ye muſt purge your gold by Antimony according to art, than Amallgame it with mercury, and ſette it in a furnes of reuerberation vntill it become ſpongious & light, and of a purple colour, & ſo that it cannot be brought to gold againe, out of the which yee ſhall draw his tyncture with Acetum alcaliſatum, by digeſting it in Balneo 40. dayes, being cloſe luted with hermes ſeale: The which yee ſhall afterward vapour away, and circulat it with Alcoholl vini, alcaliſated, whereby his force ſhall be meruailouſly increaſed, for the curing of diuers and ſundrie diſeaſes, of the which tincture ʒ i. being mixed with ℥ i. of Aqua theriacalis, is taken euery morning ℈ i. faſting for the ſpace 10. dayes.

Who then will diſalow their due preparations, and extractions of their quinteſſences. Concerning Iron as it is not without byting, ſo by ſpagyricall preparation it looſeth his corroſiue qualities, becauſe there is a certaine ſub till ſubſtance drawne out of it, or els it is brought into oile which may be miniſtred inwardly with more ſafetee and with great profite againſt the ſame diſeaſes becauſe it may be ſuffered of the naturall heate, and it wil alſo worke kindly vpon the bodie. This Galen alſo doth teſtify in his 9. boke of the properties of ſimple medicines 42. chap. where he ſpeaketh of the ſcalles of braſſe, all ſcalles ſaith he doe drie verie ſore, but they differ among themſelues, for ſome drie more, ſome leſſe, becauſe ſome are of a more groſſe, and ſome of a more thinne eſſence, afterward he addeth: but all flakes or ſcalles are ſtrongly byting, wherby it is euident that the matter of their ſubſtance is not thin but rather groſſe, for amongeſt thoſe thinges which haue that quallitye, that which is the thinneſt is leaſt byting. The Spagyrikes therefore do draw out of Iron, but eſpecially of ſteele a moſt ſubtill ſubſtance, which alſo with the fier of reuerberation they make thinner, and thereof prepare crocus martis: out of the which afterward they draw their oile which is a moſt excellent and no byting medicine againſt the Diarrheam, lienteria, Diſenteria, & flux of the liuer, a notable medicine for the ſtomacke, and againſt all iſſues of bloud as well inward as outward, if it be mixed with conſerue of Roſes or Comferie, being prepared and confected after this manner.

then afterwarde with freſh water, then put thereon ſharpe vineger that it may be couered foure fingers high, let it ſtād certaine daies in the ſunne, powring on freſh viniger oftentimes that the filings may be made ſubtill. This ye ſhall reuerberate a whole day in an open veſſall vntil it be brought into a fine light red powder by the force of fire, the which you may vſe: Then with his ſharpe menſtrue or the ſpirit of wine well prepared, you may drawe eaſily forth his ſpirite, whereof ye may make his oile, whereof one drop is giuen in a conuenient decoction, or mingled with ſome aſtringēt conſerue, to the vſes afore ſaid: In this manner alſo is a lawdable medecine made out of Iron: Calcine the filinges of Iron in a violent fire with the flower of ſulphur vntill all the filings be come red, and till the ſtinking earth be vaniſhed away: reuerberat this the ſpace of a whole day, and it will come, to a very fine purple powder, the which as I ſay before may be kept for your vſe.

Take the ſaid powder after the oile is diſtilled from it, calcine it, and diſſolue it with freſh vineger, and vapour it away to the thicknes of honye, then let it coole and one part will turne to ſalt being very white in the bottome, & the oile will be yellow and ſwim on the top the which yee ſhall power of into another glaſſe, for it is the ſweete oile of ſaturne, the which if one drop be put into faire water it wil be turned like milke, the which is vſed to beautify the face, and is called lac virginis. Then if yee will vſe the ſalt that remained in the bottome to bewtify: take the quantity of a ſmall nut, and diſſolue it with the iuice of lemondes and there with annoint the face ſlightly.

Paulus Aegineta writeth this of Mercury in his 7 booke: Many haue giuen to drinke Mercury burned to aſhes, mingled with other ſpices to thoſe that haue had the chollike and paine in the bowels: latter Phiſitions doe vſe crude Mercury to kill the wormes in children as Mathiolus reporteth in the 5. of his commentaries vpon Dioſ

                           crides out of braſſauola. Many vſe crude Mercury to cure the poxe and make thereof pilles which they call De barberoſſa: the diſcription whereof Rondelecius a learned man (my maiſter) hath ſhewed in his boke de morbo gallico. In outward diſeaſes many do onely vſe precipitate prepared with Aqua fortis which is good to heal al maligne vlcers, eſpecially of the pox, and that without paine if it bee well prepared. With this remedie my father (A man of godly memorie, and one that deſerued well of all men for his phiſicke) did vſe to take away the fleſh of the necke of the blather, whereof when hee had ſhewed me the true preparation, I vſed it often with moſt happie ſucceſſe both to cure that diſeaſe, as alſo the vlcer of the blather: whereof Steph. caretonus, an Appoticary famous both for learning and experience was an eye witnes. For a certaine noble man frend to vs both, which had bin ſicke three yeares of a perilous vlcer in the necke of his bladder, by meanes of a fowle Gonorrhoea vnperfectly cured.

haue enforced Phiſitions (euen without the counſail of Galen) to ſearch out theſe properties, wherof at the length experience (the miſtris of all thinges) hath made them certaine. For the truth which conſiſteth in reaſon ought to be manifeſted vnto the ſence, and experience is not perceaued but by the ſence, as Galen teſtifyeth in his 6. book De ſanitate tuenda. It is neceſſarie (ſaith hee) that thoſe thinges which are to be thought vpon be conſidered by reaſon, and afterward certifyed by experience to the intent that reaſon by experience may be confirmed. And in the ſecond of the ſame booke hee writeth thus: the force of reaſon ſheweth the ſtrength of the experiment. Who could otherwiſe prooue that the Cyaneum and Armenie ſtones do helpe melancholy affections? Perſely to hurt women with childe, and to doe no good againſt the fallyng ſickneſſe? That Harmodactiles could purge flegme out of the ioyntes? that Lapis Iudaicus and Lyncis ſhoulde breake the ſtone? that pearles ſhould ſtrengthen the hart, or that Napellus is ſo deadly a poiſon, ſaue onely that by the practiſe and working of the foreſaid thinges it had bin proued by diuers experiences▪ In like maner by experience it is found out that Mercury is a fit remedie to cure many infirmities. As for example Doctor Ioubertus a learned man, lately tried it to be a moſt excellent remedie to cure the woundes made with ſhot, who thereof cō
                        poſeth his Triapharmacum. Neither is it to bee maruelled, when as with ſlender preparations it becommeth ſo forcible, if with far better it attaineth the higheſt degree of perfection amongeſt medicines to cure many, and thoſe otherwiſe vncurable diſeaſes, as well inward as outward. This excellent preparation of Mercury is hard and difficult and not onely vnknowen vnto manie Phiſitions and Poticarieso
                           •
                        f one ſort, but verie few of the ſpagerikes haue truely attained thereunto. For Mercurie is a flying ſpirit hauing a certaine arſenicall aire verie hurtfull to the bodie: whereof at length being clenſed and fixed, are made ſo excellent medicines▪ & thoſe ſo holſome: (for it is the propertie of euery perfect ſpirit to quicken the bodie) that it ſeemeth not credible except vnto ſuch as are cunning and experienced, I wiſh hartely

and deſire earneſtlye (leaſt my iudgement may ſeeme different from reaſon) that the learned would conſider the nature of theſe three Mercuries, the common Mercurye, the Mercury ſublimate, and Mercury precipitate: I knowe that there is not any man except he be altogether ignorant, but he will affirme that the ſublimate Mercurie is more venemous, then either the crude which ſome doe miniſter in pilles inwardly to kill wormes (as is aforeſaid) or the precipitate: whereof Paulus Aegineta, ſeemeth to ſpeake where he intrcateth of Mercurie brought into aſhes, which in time paſt was geuen for the collike, which is made thus, or at leaſt with ſulphur. And many men at this day without any other preparation than with bare and ſimple waſhinges do giue Mercurie precipitate to cure the pox. (as Matheolus witneſſeth) neither do we perceiue although it purge vpwarde and downeward, that it doth hurt like vnto the ſublimat, whereof halfe a ſcruple will kill a man. If this which is true be grā

                        ecipate, how commeth it to paſſe (I pray you) that ſublimation (the only purifying which al philoſophers do vſe) I meane this ſpirit exalted ſhould get ſuch malignitie & venemous force. Some will anſweare peraduenture our Auberius, that this doth not come by ſublimation (by which it is certaine all thinges are purifyed) but by carying with it a certaine ſubtil ſharpnes from the things that are mingled with it. Let vs then examine this, of one pound of crude mercury, another pound of crude vitrioll, and as much common ſalt, not armonicke (as Matheolus thinketh) mingled altogether, at a ſoft fire, and ground on a ſtone, or morter, that it might be well incorporated, and brought into a pouder, and put in to a ſubliming glaſſe, giuing fier thereto by degrees for the ſpace of 40. howers, is made your mercurie by ſublimate. If then he draw venemous quallity from the things it is mingled withall, of neceſſitie it muſt be from ſalt and vitrioll. But that common ſalt and vitrioll do not hurt as poiſon. Infinite numbers doe daily prooue the ſame which eate ſalt in their meates, and drincke vitrioll water in their baths: And many other throughout Germany and Italie do vſe the ſpirit

and oile of vitrioll for the curing of the falling ſickneſſe, the ſtone and aſthma, with great eaſe and meruellous profit. ſimp. ca. 60. lib. 5.
                        And Dioſcorides ſpeaking of vitrioll ſaith thus: it killeth the broad wormes in the bellie ʒ i. of it being taken inward. Being dronke with water, it helpeth againſt the poyſon of toadſtooles: and diſſolued in water, dropped into the noſe purgeth the head. By this it doth ſufficiently appeare that ſo great a venemous quallitie is not in Mercury ſublimat by meanes of vitrioll: much leſſe it is to be thought of commō ſalt. Finally if ſo great malignitie were in it by meanes of the ſalte or vitrioll, becauſe it carrieth vp the ſpirites with him this malignitie alſo would be in Mercurie precipitat, for the ſtrong water wherwith it is made is compounded of the ſpirites of vitrioll and ſalte: with the which alſo the phiſitions make their precipitate, which many of them doe miniſter without further preparation: which albeit through his great ſharpnes by meanes of the ſpirits incloſed in the ſtrōg water it purgeth the bodie violently, yet it is well knowen vnto many learned men at this day, that it doth not hurt as the ſublimat doth. This malignity therefore in the ſublimat commeth by how much the more it is made ſubtill and ſtronger by exaltation and flyeth with a ſmall heate: but in the precipitate it is not ſo, for it is mortifyed and ſo fixed with that philoſophilall fier the ſtrong water, that it will ſuffer great heat, neither can that maligne aire be ſent vnto the hart (if it containe any) which by nature is eaſily aſſaulted with all poyſons, becauſe that the naturall heat cannot cauſe the precipitate to fume, which no violence of fier can cauſe to vaniſh away, as by certaine experiences is approued: the fixing therefore of his ſpirit is the true preparation that either taken inward or applied outward cānot hurt: the which many go about to do ſundry wayes (I ſpeake of them which ſeeke his preparation onely for phiſicke) which think by powring on the water twiſe or thriſe vpō the feces (which they call caput mortuum) and ſo diſtill it againe that the true preparation of ſo great a medecine may be attayned, but they are not a little deceaued, ſpecially becauſe they are not carefull to take away his corroſiue, or elſe know not how to

do it: for truly Mercury precipitat can neuer be a ſufficient profitable medicine ſo long as the corroſiue quality taken of the ſtrong water is ioyned with it, which is not taken away as many ſuppoſe with common waſhings, but with farre other preparations and dulcifyinges, which beyng vnknowen no perfect thing can be wrought, therefore ye muſtworke after this order following, ſpecially for the making of turpetum that wonderfull medicine.

                        De arſenico. AMongeſt the corroſiue medicines which by the extreame ſharpnes of heat do diſtroy our naturall heate, or conuert it into fiery quallity, and by their malignant nature diſſolue the naturall moyſture, conſume all the ſubſtāce of the bodie, and cauſe putrifaction with ſtinche: the Phiſitions do accompt Arſenicke, ſandrake, and orpiment: and therefore do iudge the vſe of thoſe medicines very perilous in chirurgery nether by any meanes neceſſary becauſe they

are ſo venemous and contrary to our nature. This they may verie well ſay if they knew not their true preparatiōs, wherby they are made apt to cure many outward infirmities. Theſe medecines are ſaid to be venemous, for their maligne quallitie and ſharpnes. But that euil quallity conſiſteth in the ſpirit, ſtinking aire, or blacke ſmoake which it ſendeth out with a ſmall heate, but the ſharpnes is onely in the ſalt: This venemous and blacke ſmoke when it is raiſed by natural heate doth weake the matter of the part, corrupteth it, & oftentimes killeth, as if one had dronke poiſon, if it be not laide too farre from the principall partes, ſpecially the ſkin being wounded, which happened to a certaine woman: and Fernelius the chiefe of phiſitions of our time witneſſeth, that he ſaw it: ſeeing that maligne quality is in the blacke ſmoke, it muſt be altogether fixed: for by fixing as we ſaid before in the chapter of mercurie all the venom is taken away from the ſpirites, as from arſenicke, mercurie, orpiment, & others: The ſharpnes is taken away by extracting the ſalt, which may be done by their proper waſhinges, as wee haue before ſhewed, by which reaſon arſenike ſhall not hurt, but profit much in locall medicines for poiſoned woundes, the wolfe, fiſtula, canker and gangrena, if it be dulie prepared, fixed, and ſweetned. Of which true preparation Dioſcorides ſeemeth ſecretly to intreat of, when as hee ſpeaketh of that 
                           ſimpl. 5. cap. 71.metalline ſandaraca, which in the beginning of the chapter he writeth to ſmell of ſulfur. It is giuen with mulſum to thoſe that coughe out rotten matter, and to thoſe that are ſhort winded, it is verie well giuen in drinke with roſen. It is verie hurtful to geue ſandrake vnprepared: when as Galen doth witnes, it is of a burning quallitie, vnto whoſe opinion Dioſcorides alſo agreeth in the ſixt booke 29. chapter of ſimples. Lib. 9. ſimp. cap. 53.
                        Therefore it will not be amiſſe or hurtfull to vſe arſenicke, or any other coroſiue medicine being prepared in chirurgerie ſpecially, the preparation therof is thus: ſublime arſenicke 3. times with ſalt prepared and rubifyed vitrioll & the ſcalles of Iron that yee may purge it, which afterward yee ſhall fixe with ſalt peeter, giuing fyer by degrees the ſpace of 24. howres, and it will be a maſſe whiter then ſnow. Reſembling

                     Many alſo ſublime arſenicke 3. times cum calce fixa & colchothare, then diſſolue it in aqua ſtigia, fixatoria, ac conueniente, for that purpoſe diſtilling the water often from the feces, thā reuerberate the caput mortuum, which will come to a white powder fixed, from which the alkalie is drawen out with the alchoole of wine, and ſo is made ſweete, the vſe of this is to cure fiſtulaes and cankers.

The bathes or drinking of ſweet waters, is very hurtfull to the ſicke of the dropſie: But of ſalte ſulpherie and pitchie waters is very profitable. Dioſcorides, writeth that ſulfur eaten with a rere egge, helpeth thoſe that are ſhorte winded: But the Spagirickes haue attained to many things vnknowne to the auncient Phiſitions. Finally of ſulfur is alſo madeth ſower oyle by a bell, which is a very profitable remedie for the teeth, and cureth alſo cancered vlcers.

                        De antimonio. NOt onely for outward greefes but alſo for inwarde, are medicines made of Antimoni. The chymical Phiſitions drawe out of it a moſt excellent medicine, which they call the tincture of antimoni, for they minding to try the force of Antimoni in mans body, feared not to ſeeke out the ſecrets of it, eſpecially when they perceiued it to bee the greateſt purger of gold, and that it could driue away all impurities. By which meanes they labour to ſeeke out the qualities of Antimoni, that they might prooue whether it would worke the ſame effect in purging of mans body, as it was euident to worke in the purging of golde, at the length they obtained their deſired purpoſe, and found out the great excellencie of this medicine: both to reſtore & renue the body of man, ſpecially to cure the Mophew, the Dead euill, the Wolfe, and all maligne vlcers, for that tincture purgeth black bloud and all other viſcious humors without any manifeſt euacuationes, but onely by corrections of ill humors. Let no man thinke that I ſpeake of Vitrum Antimonij, which many vnskilfull doo vſe now a daies with great danger, it is a noy-ſome medicine which by his ſharpenes prouoketh the expulſiue

power, and purgeth both vpwarde and downe-warde with great vexation, the which I can by no meanes allowe. For all diſeaſes are not cured with violence, but with fitte and conuenient purgations, For as Hipocrates ſaith. 1. Aphori. if ſuch things be purged as ought to be purged it doth helpe, and they beare it eaſily: if not contrariwiſe. But all true Philoſophers therfore auoide theſe vitrifications, and not ſeeke their medicines or tinctures in them, vſe therfore this method following.

                        GAlen and other great phiſitions haue taught vs many thinges out of Andromacus touching the preparation of vipers and their vertue for the cure of the leproſie which they had proued, chiefly that it purgeth the whole body by the ſkinne, out of whoſe fleſh (the head and taile being firſt cut of, which are the moſt venemous partes, and haue litle fleſh in them) being boyled in a pot with faire water, dill & ſalt, and putting thereto ſtale wheaten bread, they made paſtillos, the which is alſo put into theriakle. Out of vipers alſo you ſhall make a moſt notable medecine againſt the leproſie, plague and all venemous woundes in this maner. In the moneth of Iune take 4 or 6. vipers, of the which yee ſhall caſt away the taile and the head, and pull away the ſkinne and the intralles, but cut the fleſh in ſmall peeces, and put it in acucurbit of glaſſe 3. or 4. daies in the vapor of Balneo or of moiſt dung to driue forth the ſweat. But take heede ye receaue not the air of that fume which is corrupted & venemous through the vapors of the vipers, which being done powre vpon it the ſpirit of wine Alcoliſati & terebinthinati ſolutiui ana. that it might bee couered 8. fingers high, digeſt them in a veſſel cloſed with Hermes ſeale in Balneo, or moiſt dung twelue daies, vntill all the fleſh of the vipers be diſſolued in the aforeſaid menſtrua: then powre of the ſaid menſtrua from his feeces, and vapor it away in Balneo, and it will be coagulated like a iellie, vpon the which powre againe ſpiritum vini cariophillatum & circulat them in a pellicane 10. daies: then ſeperat the menſtrua, and the fleſh of the vipers wil remaine excellently prepared & eſſentificated, with the which mingle vpō a gentle fire oleum anethi & cinamomi ana. 1 ſcrup. & a halfe, eſſentia croci & margaritarum ana. 1. ſcrup. then with the muſlege of gum tragagant make it in pilles, or if yee will make paſtillos after the olde manner with drye wheaten bread, 1. ſcrup. of this medicine is giuen againſt the leproſie, the plague and all other venemous diſeaſes.
                     Of the ſkin of vipers, and of other ſerpentes being dryed

and prepared according to art is made a powder that helpeth very much againſt the woundes made by beaſtes or ſerpentes, if it be laied thereon, alſo to cure all cankers & maligne vlcers.

The hartes horne is vſed in ſtead of that bone for the ſaid diſeaſes, whoſe eſſence is drawē forth with Hipericonis alcoole which is giuen vnto young children that be ſicke of the wormes.
                     The horne of the Vnicorne (which is the chiefeſt of al, you ſhall prepare in the ſame order: it defendeth the hart and driueth away all poiſons: it is good againſt peſtilent difeaſes, his proper menſtrua is Alcoole meliſſae. Ebur or Iuerie is alſo thus prepared, whoſe vertue is to defend the ſtrength of the hart, and to helpe conception. Out of Muſke is alſo drawen a certaine precious eſſence cum vini ſpiritu terebinthinato, as with his proper diſſolution, which doth ſtrengthen and confirme the languiſhing partes, and helpeth the weakned powers: in like ſort may you draw forh the eſſence of zibet.
                     In the like manner is the eſſence of Caſtoreum drawne forth: of the which one drop is giuen with great profit in the decoction of the flowers of roſemarie, ſage, and betony againſt tremblinges, conuulſions, or crampes, and all diſeaſes


of the ſinewes: it is alſo applyed outwardly in conuulcions, chieflie if it come of fulneſſe and not of emptines: and then that which is contained in the ſinues contrarie to nature muſt be purged, being dronke with water of penyryall, it prouoketh womens termes and caſteth forth the after burthen, and it doth correct opium which is otherwiſe deadly.

I thinke there is no man if he way theſe wordes of Galen which will not allow theſe extractions both of oiles and eſſences which we vſe, and commend the vſe of them in phiſicke. In this manner are oiles drawne out of the fat of men, of the brocke, of beares, of wolues, of hartes, cattes eeles, capons, geeſe, duckes, calues, hogges, and of all Marrowes, which do all reſolue and ſupple, and are good to cure many diſeaſes.

                     Out of waxe is made an oile to reſolue, & attenuate, and is profitable againſt all colde greefes of the ſine wes, and is made thus. Take one pound of yellow wax, and melt it, then powre it in ſweet wine & wring it out with your hands,

then melt it againe, & powre it into the ſame wine, and this doe 4. or fiue times, then put it into a retort with an halfe poūd of calcined allome, and a handfull of ſage, and diſtill it with a gentel fire, and there wil come forth a groſſe thick oile and white, the which if it bee rectifyed three times, it will be perfect cleere, and will congeale no more.
                     The vertues of oile of wax experimented by Monſure le counte de Shenaus, & his brother Monſure de Argenteaw in the warres in France. This oile is of a temperat nature to be vſed either into the bodie or outward, and may be vſed with out all danger: it taketh away the paines of the gout if yee annoint the partes therewith, it comforteth hard ſine wes, and ioynt aches, the ſciatica, choppes in the lippes, breaſt, handes or feete, and woundes, burninges either with fire or water, if ye annoint therewith and lay thereon a plaſter of the ſame, being put into the eare with black wool, it helpeth deafnes, it ſtaieth haire from falling. It is alſo good againſt the winde collicke, and prouoketh vrine, if ye vſe to drinke euery morning ʒ. 1. with malmeſie: it preuaileth againſt the ſtitch in the ſide, if yee drinke thereof and annoint the parts therewith. To be ſhort, it helpeth againſt all manner of infirmities, as hath bin diuers times prooued.

If any be troubled with a feuer, let them annoint all their bodie therewith, and lay them downe to ſweate, and they ſhall be cured: it taketh away the ſtinch of the armepittes if ye annoint the partes therewith in a bath or ſtoue, being mixed with wine, and the mouth waſhed therewith, it faſteneth the teeth and gummes: when ye will vſe this oile

                           Oleum ex Galbano. THis gumme muſt firſt be diſſolued in diſtilled vineger, and then diſtilled in a retort with a gentle fire: this oile is moſt profitable againſt inwarde bruſes, and crampes, and ſhtinking of ſinewes: being dronke with oile of mirrha, it is good againſt venome being either dronke or ſhotte into the body with venemous arrowes: alſo dronke in the ſame order it prouoketh womens termes, and deliuereth the dead fruit, the fume of this oile being receaued at the lower partes, worketh the ſame effect. Alſo the fume of this oile being taken at the mouth, helpeth the riſing of the mother, being layd to the nauell it cauſeth the matrix to ſtay in his naturall place: the fume of this oile is profitable againſt the falling ſicknes if ye annoint the noſtrelles therewith. In this maner ye may make oile of labdanū, opoponax, ſagapenum, Amoniacum, and ſuch like, which doe ſoften the knots of the gout, and doth mightily diſſolue the hardnes of the liuer, ſplene and other members if they be diſtilled all together, or taken euerie one by himſelfe, according to the method preſcribed.

The water of egges being diſtilled taketh away ſcarres and ſpottes in the face or other places. The oile comforteth againſt all paines, it helpeth woundes by gunſhot, it preuaileth much againſt burninges and ſcaldings, either with fire, or water, or powder: it maketh haire blacke, if ye annoint it therewith, it ſlaketh the paines of the hemeroides if yee annoint them therewith often times.

The yolkes of egges being diſtilled with as much white wax, is moſt precious to heale woundes and bruſes, for it reſolueth them with great ſpeede, the ſtomacke being annointed therwith cauſeth good digeſtion, and comforteth it meruellouſlie.

So is oile of Quinces, and myrtilles made, which refrigerat and aſtringe, and are applied to the ſtomacke, liuer, braine and weake bowelles, and alſo to the fundement. In like manner are oiles made of Camomill and Lilies which doth ſtrengthen the ſinewes, moderat, reſolue, and ſwage aches: but theſe are made with ripe ſweet oile prepared as afore.
                        Of mintes, wormewood, lentiſcus, and others after the

ſame order, are oiles made with oleum omphacinum, which being annointed doth moderatly warme the ſtomacke, and ſtrengthen the other partes, and helpe concoction, but firſt they are prepared with their proper water, and aſtringent wine, and muſt be clenſed from all feces in Balneo certaine daies as is afore ſaid: But if any man will warme, attenuat, and digeſt the more ſtrongly by theſe oiles, let him take like portions of oile purifyed in Balneo and the ſpirit of wine.

They are good for all colde greefes of the braine or ſinewes, and diſperſe winde: But all theſe oiles of hot quallities will be much better if they be drawne onely with the ſpirit of wine in Balneo, without any addition of other oile, as Galen 1. ſimp. cap. 15.

                     Of artificiall ſaltes, and their properties. Chap. 1.
                     
                     
                        Of artificiall ſaltes. THe vſe and profit of ſaltes that are drawen out of ſimples by calcination are in maner as great in phiſicke as the rocke or common ſalt is, which daily and in general ſerueth to mans releefe: for when from ſimples a groſſe fleme is taken awaye, which in troth hindereth their operation, how much more woulde they performe their operation if they were conuerted into a ſpirituall matter, which by long diſtillations and filtrings is cauſed that they may change by a certaine manner into a firye matter: therefore it is not to be doubted that when the ſimples be conuerted into a ſalte, and the element of fire hath in no ſuch wiſe dominion in them, but that they pierce ſooner, and may performe their proper action: that ſuch a heape or companie of diuers ſimples,

ſhall not neede beſides in the compoſition of remedies: for ſuch ſalts haue certaine properties the which other purgers being diſtilled want: for euerie ſalt ſaith Theophraſtus Paracelſus purgeth, but the diſtilled waters of the purgers lacke or haue not the ſame propertie, becauſe his ſalt is not ioyned in the ſame, ſo that I ſuppoſe a great tartnes or ſharpnes conſifteth in them all.
                     The manner and faſhion to prepare theſe ſaltes are diuers according to the opinion of the Authors. Some will the hearbes to be gathered in their due time, and diſtill away the water in Balneo, then calcine the feces, and with their proper water draw forth the ſalt, the which yee ſhall calcine in a fornace of calcination, and diſſolue it againe and congeale it: and this ye ſhall do vntill it be white as ſnowe: the which afterward by a workeman may be brought chriſtalline. Theſe ſaltes called alkalye, muſt be kept in a glaſſe cloſe ſtopped, becauſe the aire will ſoon reſolue them, which happeneth (eſpecially to thoſe that are made of hearbes, & thoſe ſubſtances) which poſſeſſe and haue more quantity of eile, and the ſubtiller.
                     
                        Obſeruations. Some calcine them ſlightly, ſome more, ſome leſſe, ſome make their ſalte with their owne water diſtilled from the hearbes: ſome with raine water diſtilled from thoſe kind of hearbes being drie or greene, ſome put on the water colde, ſome hot, and ſo let it ſtand certaine daies ſtirring it often, the which is not amiſſe, then diſtill it by a filter vntill it bee cleere, and vapor it away in Balneo, vntill it bee drie, then calcine it againe, and diſſolue it in ſome conuenient liquor, and then congeale it againe, and this yee ſhall doe vntill it be white as ſnow, the which by often calcining and diſſoluing may be brought chriſtalline, whereof one graine is of more force then fixe of the firſt.

which is a meane mineral called ſal gemmae, or ſtone ſalt, the which is found in mountaines in the prouince of Calabria, and in Spaine in the Ile of Iuiza, whereof there are diuers medicines prepared, the ſecond is artificiall, as is made in Cheſhire, and diuers other places by boiling it. The third kinde is made in the ſand by extreame heate of the ſunne: but the moſt pleaſanteſt and well reliſhed ſalt is that which is boiled on the fire, for it is pure and white, neuertheleſſe the ſalt of the mountaine is of more vertue in phiſicall cauſes: for if it be calcined 40. dayes and then diſſolued in the quinteſſence of honie, it is of ſuch vertue that it will in maner reuiue a man that lies ſpeechleſſe if yee giue him a ſpoonefull thereof to drinke: alſo this ſalt being made in a pultus with branne and oile, and applied warme, helpeth many griefes. Alſo a decoction of ſal gēmae with wine and oile being giuen in a cliſter is moſt profitable againſt pains of the head, the ſciatica, and paines of the raines, and likewiſe is profitable for thoſe that are troubled with a carnoſitie in the yard: for by nature it preſerueth all thinges from putrefaction: alſo this ſalt being often calcined, diſſolued & congealed, may be vſed in meates in ſtead of common ſalt, for it procureth an appetite, cauſeth digeſtion, killeth wormes with diuers other vertues. Alſo it may be made fuſible in this order.

To the cōtrary, if ye drink the waight of ʒ i. it will heate the bodie maruellouſlie. Alſo a water made of ſal nitri and roch allome according to art is of ſuch an extreme heat that it wil diſſolue ſiluer, copper, Iron, ſteele, and all other ſortes of mettalles preſently into water. Moreouer being mixed with cole and ſulfur, it maketh gunpowder. Alſo ſal nitri being calcined 30. daies with as much tartar, and circulated with the ſpirites of wine mixed with the ſpirites of cinamom, ginger, and cloues, it will bee a moſt rare medicine to cure the Etiſie, and dropſie, & ſuch like diſeaſes.

                        HYpocrates, in his booke de natura humana doth write, that purging medicines doe drawe vnto them the humors which are vnnaturall in the body, not by a common mingled quallitie, but by the ſimillytude or property of the whole ſubſtance, and an ingrafted famillyaritie. Whoſe ſentence Galen confirmeth againſt Aſclepiadem and Eraſsistratum, who thought that purging medicynes, could not drawe any one humor, Lib de purgans med facult,but whatſoeuer they touched, they could conuert & turne it into their owne nature, and ſo indifferently like leaches or boxes, to draw the ſharpe thinne humors as is moſt apt to purge, rather then groſſe and thicke: But whereas al alterations are done either by force of heate, or by driuing away the emptie, or by a ſimilitude of the whole ſubſtance, that onely (as Galen writeth) is done with the Sim
                           •
                        athiae of quallities, or els with the likenes of the whole eſſence: which things though I haue plainely ſhewed them, yet they cannot be expreſſed with wotdes, and the Greekes call it 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is a propertie, which cannot be declared. So the Amber doth draw ſtrawes, and the loadſtone Iron: by which reaſon it is ſaide that Rhabarbe expelleth coller, Agaricke fleame, and Senna blacke choller, although beſides this peculier power of purging, euery one of them haue a certaine generall facultie to drawe other humors, which is to be iudged by the compoſition of many medycines, with which we vſe to purge diuers humors, which alone would not ſuffice to purge by themſelues, if thoſe ſimples did not worke together, with naturall helpe to euacuate, & with a common force did prouoke the expulſiue power. It is ment (ſaith Galen) that the ſimples mingled together doe agree and not differ Lib quos purg conue quibus & quo nodos▪
                     in any thing. Amongſt theſe medicines ſome bee dygeſtiues of choller which cheifly euacuate yellow choller▪ ſome of fleagme, that euacuat fleame, ſome of mellancholly

which euacuate blacke choller, and ſo forth of the other humors. Therebe alſo other medicines which by the vaines of the inward partes and belly doe caſt out the bloud it ſelfe, which are called Jmpropriae ſeeing they bee poyſons; neither doe they alone purge, but alſo deſtroye and kill as Galen witneſſeth, who telleth a hiſtorie of a certaine man that had found an herbe, which firſte toke Libro de purg medicam fac Chap. 6.
                     awaye the blood of them that tooke it, and then afterwarde the life alſo; but thoſe are to be reiected of al other: for the true & only euacuating of blood is done by opening of a vaine, & not by thoſe medicines which by a certaine maligne and ſharpe quallitie and deadly propertie, doe eate the vaines, and by alteration caſt out the blood, the treaſure of life not without great violence of ſpirites and vexation of nature,
                  But of theſe purging medicines there are▪ 3. orders or ſortes.

                  The ſecond are more milder, or gentle, which are ſo called becauſe they purge gentlie without any greife, and they voide the hurtfull humors, not of the whole body, but of certain partes, and ſoften the belly, and do but litle decline from nouriſhing of nature, which among herbes are theiſe, Malua, Mercurialis, Violae, Roſae, Braſsica, Beta, ſerum lactis purnes, manna theribinthina & caſsia medulla, which neede no other preparation then the common, that they may be ſafly taken.

The cauſe of the purging quallitie of all theſe ſimples is this: that a certaine thinne portion of it ſtirred vp by naturall heate, creepeth in by the open conditts or paſſages, into the leſſer vaines, and from thence floweth into the greater, from the which by the liuer it is turned into the inteſtinalls, and into the reynes it ſelfe, and then followeth euacuation of humores, by the belly, which ſometimes are diſcerned by the vrine, in which, as well the coloure as the ſauor of the medicine receaued is manifeſtly ſeene, which any man may trie in Rhabarbe & ſenuae.
                  
                  Seing therfore the vapor of theſe medicines which we call the eſſence, being ſtirred vp by naturall heate from the earthy partes, doth attenuate the reſting humor and moueth the nature of the parte with a contrarie quallitie, and prouoketh it to caſt out their earthly ſubſtance, or feces remaining in the ſtomake and the inward partes, who then is ſo doltiſh, that wil not commend the ſpagiricall preparation of theſe medicines, wherewith wee doe drawe forth the eſſence which is the true purger, and take away the maligne quallitie: Or at the leaſt we ſuppreſſe it with his owne menſtrua, which agreeth with his properties, and haue an vnitie with them. We ſeperate the feces or yearth as deadly and hurtfull, which doth much offend for his thicknes, cleauing vnto the tunicle of the ſtomake which Galen affirmeth out of Hipocrates in theſe wordes: Lib quos purg conue & er

                     For ſaith he, the purging medicine how ſmal ſoeuer it be, it muſt needes goe to the bottom of the ſtomacke, and in going do wne the ſtomake, and what ſoeuer is found about it is infected, not onely by the quallitie of the medicine, but alſo by the cleauing of the ſubſtance: in the ſwallowing it is greatly hurte, and againe, thoſe that are of more thinner eſſences, more readily executed their proper

Our extractions of eſſēces is to be commēded in which al theſe things are performed the proper purgatiue quallitie of the humor notwithſtanding reſerued in the medicine as alſo it is made ſo much the ſtronger in that his vnprofitable earth and fex is ſeperated from it, and by his proper menſtrua ioined vnto it all the maligne quallitie is taken awaye, Lib quos purg, dec & caet cap 8.
                     which Galen writeth is to bee done, where he ſaith, thoſe ſeedes are to be mingled with medicines, which mittygate their mallignitie and hinder not their worke which haue force to extenuate & to cut, that they may cutt aſunder groſſe humors, and open the wayes by which they muſt be auoyded. All which thinges all learned men may iudge to be done in our preparations. But ſome will ſaye the extraction of eſſences is not ſo neceſſarie, when as 
                        Lib. 7.
                     Actuarius commaundeth (vnto whoſe opynion Paulus agreeth) that to ſuch as are of a weake ſtomacke. 15. or. 20. graines of Lathiris are to be ſwallowed whole, & he ſaith, that though they be not bruſed minime

                     force to Eſullae, and theſe medicines are ſo ſharpe and vehement, that they purge both vpward and doneward, with great vexation, and by that meanes the more violent they


be, the more they hurt the ſtomak: but the ſlender body, as 
                        Simp. 1. caq. 12.
                     Galen writeth, is eaſier altered and chaunged of that whereunto it is applyed: but that which is groſſer is not chaunged but in a great time, and ſcarce at length feeleth any ſenſible alteration, for we trye by experience that we are ſo much the ſoner heated with pepper, as by how much the ſmaller it is beaten, and euen ſo muſt we iudge of the purging medicines, therefore in ſteade of thoſe Infutions and decoctions after the cōmon ſorte we vſe their eſſences, and that healthfully & without hurting of the ſtomak, or any of the other partes. But thoſe vehement medicines otherwiſe to be feared, haue beene ſo rightly prepared of the true ſpagiricks, that their malitious quallities and ſharpnes haue bin altogether bridled with their proper corrections, and ſo haue ſerued in ſteade of gentler medicines for the cure of diuerſe diſeaſes. So our Eſſence of Elcborus Niger being well prepared is miniſtred at this day in many places, and is ſafly giuen to children to loſen the belly without any labor: In the meane ſeaſon there bee a great number which ignorantly condemne theſe eſſences, and ſpeake againſt the vſe of them, and ſpew out the poyſon of their gaule againſt them, at whoſe rayling I ceaſe to meruaile: becauſe the Poet ſaith, that to thoſe men that think nothing right but what them ſelues doe, nothing can be founde more vniuſt or wicked then that they doe not: But there bee other which being ouercome with reaſon, will at laſt commend theſe our extractions of eſſences out of all thinges, but yet they feare this one thing, that is their fierie nature in them by a certeine quallitie receaued of the outwarde fire, and therefore they refuſe the vſe of them, chiefly in agues, and for curing of hott effectes, by which they ſhew themſelues to be vnskillful in the Spagirick Arte, and to giue raſhly iudgment of thinges vnknowen: For almoſt all Eſsences are drawen forth with the, temperate heate of balneo, or horſdonge, with proper meanes belonging thereto, which we call Menſtrues, becauſe the skillfull ſpagirickes by it, with their art and labor do drawe forth al the ſtrength and vertue


of any thing, ſeperating that which is pure from the earth and ſtinking feces, reſeruing onely the quickning eſcence, whoſe power riſing vp, as it were, breaking his bondes, doth drawe it ſelfe higher and ſheweth much greater force then it did before, and more effectuall for helping of the bodie. And if they will ſaye that all the menſtrues be hot, they are verie much deceaued; for the iuce of Lemonds prepared after our order is the mēſtrue for pearles, becauſe it diſſolueth them and chaungeth thē into a thinner eſſence, and yet the iuce is not hot, nor the eſſence of the pearles hot which remayneth. When the menſtrua is ſeparated awaye: And as (Galen writeth) wee muſt not call whatſoeuer is ſubtill, hot alſo, for water it ſelfe is of a more ſubbil eſſence, which is manifeſt becauſe it runneth ſpedily throwe haire and garments, and yet being ſo thinne, it neuer heateth as by his nature, neither is it the proper noriſhment of fire, but it is contrarie to it. But they will aunſwere Vini alcool, his eſſence or ſpirite (which menſtrue we ofteneſt vſe) to drawe out the eſſence of all other thinges is moſt hot: let it be ſo: ſhall it therefore bee called daungerous by any meanes: Seeing the proper menſtrua is alwaies ſeperated out of euery eſſence of thinges and all his force is taken away, and euerie medicine remaineth ſimple with his proper quallities, being onely increaſed in vertue. Finally, to returne to purgings, who will deny that they haue a hidden power of heate to ſtirre vp? with which notwithſtanding, muſt bee mingled ſuch things as muſt take awaie their malignitie and make it more ſubtill and pearcing, and quicken his ſlow operation, and make it effectuall according to the opinion Lib quos purg & caet cap. 8.
                     of Galen. Therefore Paulus wileth to mingle with Eleborus, Peniroyall and ſauerie, or any of thoſe that ſoddenly paſſe through and are not hurtful to the ſtomack. Item all phiſitions doe will to mingle with Rhabarbe, Cinamond, and ſpikenard with hermodactilis Radiſh, & Cōmin, with Cnicos, Cardamomum, Aloes with Nutmegges, maſticke and cloues. with Agarick▪ turbith & ſennae, ginger: which although they bee hot, yet they are mingled in purgations: which


alſo are ſafly giuen to the ſicke of the Agew; not that a hot medicine is giuen for the Agews ſake, but that greater commoditie might followe in rooting out the humors, which cauſe the feauers: for the commoditie is greater, ſaith Galen, in taking awaie the moleſting humors, then the hurt which neceſſarily is done to the body by the purgations; which yet wil bee more commodiouſly donne, if whatſoeuer hurteth be taken away without payne by medicines prepared and corrected, which the cōmon phiſitions do, although they take not away the heat of the ſimple mixed in the corecting of their purgations, and notwithſtanding, they feare not to minniſter them to hott diſeaſes. But our Menſtrua of Alcoole Vini although they cal it hott, yet is it ſo ſpiritual (Yf we may vſe words of art) that with the leaſt, heate it vaporeth away, and is altogether ſeperated from that which it diſſolueth, which is ſo ſeparated from the feces that his power and ſubtil eſſence only remaineth, which alſo more aptly doth execute his proper action, whether it be to coole or heate, or to purge, and that with leſſe daunger for 2 cauſes. Firſt becauſe the eſſence of the medicine doth more ſwiftly paſſe thorow the bowells, and thereby the ſharpe and yearthy partes of them, cleauing to the inward partes, cannot vlcerate them, according to which opinion, Paulus ſpeaketh thus of Colocinthide, let it, ſaith he, be diligētly corrected, becauſe 
                        Lib. 7. cap. 4.his ſharpenes cleauing to the entrailes doe cauſe vlcers, and trouble the ſinnowes with like effects. Secondly becauſe all the noyſome qualities of thoſe Eſsences (yf they cannot be wholly taken awaye in the firſt preparation may yet be taken away or eaſily corrected with mixing of other conuenient eſſence: So the of Alloes, otherwiſe is ſlowe in purging, wil moſt ſwiftly purge, and leaſt it ſhould open the vaines by his to much ſubtilnes it may eaſſily be corrected with our oyle of Maſticke, and ſo ſafly miniſtred. But let vs heare Meſues Iudgement of all theſe preparations, who agreeing with Paulus and Auicen, that writeth Colocinthides is to be beaten ſmall for our reaſons aforeſaide in theſe wordes: It doeth require (ſaith he) long


decoction and it is (as it ſeemeth to me) with the ſonne of Serapion, contrarie to the minde of the ſonne of Zezaz, to be beaten to ſmall pouder, that his malicious power may be mixed with other exquiſite things to correct him, that it may the ſooner paſſe thorow the bowels, and not ſtay in them for the thicknes of ſome part not wel beaten, whereby it may peraduenture be longer ſtaied in the bowels, and exulcerate them, chieflie when by ſome little partes of it ſenſiblie felt. who cānot denie, but that al theſe are done more commodiouſlie with our eſſences, & with greater profit to the patient then the ſimple pouder. I thinke none, except ſome donghill raker, that is altogether vnskilfull in phiſicke. It remaineth that we ſet downe the extractions of purgers: and their preparations, and ſo to proſecute in order.

I know not why in our time wee haue left the vſe of it, and ſhunne it as it were ſome ſtrong poiſon: and yet in the ancient time it was ſo much commended (except it bee through the vnſkilfulnes of the Phiſitions) ſeeing the mallice of this medicine, and all other may eaſily be taken away with their true preparations, as we haue declared: and that this doth good, Hypocrates witneſſeth, where he maketh mē
                        tion of white Eleborus, ſaying thus. To ſome bodies (ſaith 
                           Aph. 16. lib 4.he) Eleborus is troubleſome: as in other places hee ſaith, that all byting medicines are naught for them, but it being corrected by art and induſtrie may rightly bee miniſtred to whom and when it ought, and worketh healthfully: but theſe men will ſay, that in the time of Hypocrates their bodies were more ſtronger, or elſe Heleborus in thoſe countries had no malitious qualities (for ſimples according to their ſeuerall regions and places haue ſeuerall qualities) neither ſtirreth vp ſuch fearfull paſſions as in our countrey: 
                           Lib. 2. cap. 20to which purpoſe Meſſue ſpeaketh this of Eleborus, the white becauſe it is troubleſome to the bodies of this our time, let it be ſhunned as it were a ſtrangling poiſon: and hee addeth, but the vertue of the black is tollerable euen vnto our time, although alſo verie hardlie. I thinke onely by this opinion many Phiſitions to be ſo feared, that being content with the reading of ſome writers alone, they condemne thinges they know not, and whereof they haue no experience, without

any reaſon diſalowing medicins, which is altogether an abſurditie, and vnfitly for a Phiſition at the length they will anſwere, that both the Greekes and Arabian Phiſitions did vſe thoſe violent medicines, becauſe they wanted the lighter as Rhabarb, Caſſia Manna, and ſuch like which may bee ſafely giuen and with more profit. But oh what great praiſe they get by theſe medecines in the curing of many diſeaſes. Do not theſe men know out of Hypocrates, that to extreame diſeaſes extreame medicines muſt bee applied, and that ſome times the excrements mingled with bloud in the vains muſt be drawen out, not from the onely concauitie of the partes, but from the whole bodie and from the partes fartheſt of, yea and the braine it ſelfe ſometimes, and the whole head & the inſtruments of the ſences▪ and the ſinewes, and the reſt of the intrailes muſt bee purged of many affectes: which when thoſe ſleight medicines can not doe, we muſt take the ſtronger, as Eleborus Niger chiefly. Although I knowe that at this day many notable Phiſitions both in Germany and Italie doe vſe the white with good ſucceſſe, out of the which if the eſſence be taken, as we haue taught, it may be giuen with meruellous profit of the ſicke and praiſe of the Phiſition to daily diſeaſes, and to ſuch as the ſuperfluities are broken out in the vttermoſt partes as the leproſie & Impetigo, for therein is a great and peculier power of eſſence, in that to bring foorth whatſoeuer is mingled with the bloud that doth corrupt it. It is alſo giuen to ſuch as haue the quartaine, dropſie, and are Melancholike, and to many other diſeaſes, as wee haue declared, becauſe it doth purge gently without any trouble or vomiting the excremēt of the whole bodie.

Further with his immoderate drawing it doth open the vaines, & with his ſharpnes doth excoriat the verie intrailes, and by that meanes bringeth great paines: for which cauſe Galen doth mixe him with Quinces, others do boile it with Galingale, Ginger, Aniſeed, Lib, 1. a lim.Daucus, or Smaledge ſeedes, or with the muſcledge of Pſyllium, or boile it in a ſower or tart apple to make it more milde: but by the Spagiricall preparation it may be made ſo commodious to be vſed that it may be mixed with any other medicines without any danger, and ſafly miniſtred to purge choller and fleame.
                     Diſſolue Scammonie in oile of Maſticke drawen out by the art ſpagirical with the ſpirit of wine, that being done digeſt it eight daies in Balneo cloſe ſtopped: that which is cleere and ſhining powre of, and powre on new menſtrua, vntill you haue drawen out all the eſſence, notwithſtanding put apart all the feces, then ſeperat all the menſtrua, and


put on new ſpirit of wine coroliſated, that it may be couered, four fingers, circulat them all in Balneo 10. dayes or more, then draw away the menſtrua, and for euerie ounce of eſſence that remaineth in the bottome, yee ſhall put thereto the true eſſence of corall and pearles, ana 1. ſcrup. the eſſence of ſafron halfe a ſcru. oile of Aniſeedes and cinamon ana 1. ſcrup. & a halfe, mixe them all together on a ſoft fire vntill a reaſonable thicknes. Mingle this eſſence ſo prepared with the eſſence of aloes and Mirabolanes, and it will be a compounded medicine verie profitable to purge choler, and to draw downe ſharpe excrements from the head, halfe a ſcruple may be giuen by it ſelfe with 2. oū. of oile of ſweet almondes without any trouble or heate of the hart or ſtomacke, or liuer and bringeth from thoſe places choler. To prepare Euforbium, Sagapenum, and Opoponax, you muſt diſſolue them firſt in white roſe vineger diſtilled in Balneo, then ſtraine them through a ſearce from all their terreſtriall matter, and thus thou ſhalt doe 3. times that it may bee the purer: then vapor away the vineger, that the ſharpenes may be taken away with often waſhing it with roſe water, for theſe medicines are ſharpe, and of a thinne and fierie ſubſtance: but Euphorbium of all gummes is the hotteſt, ſubtilleſt & ſwifteſt, and burneth moſt with a fierie force (as Galen witneſſeth) which it doth with ſuch violence, that Lib. 7. ſimp.we muſt greatly beware of the vſe of it except it bee rightly prepared: Serapio and Auicen haue written that ʒ iij. taken of it doth kil: and yet Aetius and Actuarius vſed it not only to purge fleame, but alſo mightily to expulſe all ſharpe excrements. 
                           Lib. 3. cap. 80.And Dioſcorides witneſſeth, that we muſt giue it to the ſicke of Iſchiadis onely mingled with honie. Paulus alſo ſaith ʒ i. of Euforbium being dronke with honie doth rather expell fleame then water. But by this preparatiō following all his maligne quall

                        tie may bee taken away, ſo that it will helpe verie much againſt the palſie, Arthritide, Crampe, dropſie, & purge fleame without any trouble whether it be thinne or thicke or lying among the ſinewes and Extractum Euforbij.ioyntes, and it is prepared in this order.
                     Take your Euforbium prepared and waſhed as is aforeſayd,

and couer it with the ſpirit of wine, ſo that you may draw forth his eſſence, ſeperating the feces, and all the impurity, then circulat al with new Alcoole ſacharino 10. daies, then ſeperat the menſtrua and coagulat it with a gentle fier putting therunto at the end the oile of maſticke 2. ſcru. olei Aniſi 1. ſcrup.

I will ſhortly if God giue mee leaue ſet forth a deſcription of our ſpagiricall practiſe, in which I will more fullie and at large declare the compoſitions and vſe of all theſe medicines.
                     
                        Extractum colocynthidis. The force of Colocynthida is ſo vehement in purging that ſometime with his onely touching, and yea, with his only ſmel he doth purge the belly of ſome. This medicine though it be otherwiſe moſt vehement, yet by the preparation following it may ſafely be miniſtred. Beate Colocynthida in moſt fine powder, and put thereon the Alcoole of wine well prepared, that it may be couered ſixe fingers, then digeſt it in Balneo 3. weekes being cloſe nipped, and in that time it will looſe all his ſharpnes: but if it be digeſted a longer time, the extraction will wax ſweet, and ſo it will be made a noble medicine againſt fleame and all other groſſe and clammy humors to draw them from the lower partes, and that without any harme, as wee haue declared, and therefore it is miniſtred with the Syrop of roſes or myrtels, againſt diſeaſes in the head, and megrim, and falling ſicknes, and apoplexia, and is alſo corrected with oile of Maſticke, Nutmegs, and cynamon.

                     The ſtone Cyaneus thus prepared may more cōmodiouſly bee giuen in the confection of Alkermes, being commended by all Phiſitions againſt the trembling of the hart, ſyncope, ſadnes, and to ſtrengthen all the ſpirites, and to driue away all poiſons.
                  
                  
                     Of the preparation of Rhabarb, Aloes, Sennae, Agaricke, Myrabolanes, Oxiphenicis, and of ſuch like of a meaner ſort.
                     THeſe medicines are compounded by Actuarius and the reſt of the Phiſitions among the true purgers, becauſe euerie of them do draw by his whole ſubſtance, their proper humor: for they purge not the whole bodie from the roote (as I may ſay) but not with ſo great trouble. Phiſitions vſe them chiefly to cure almoſt all diſeaſes, either becauſe they may bee vſed without any greater preparation then that which they themſelues know, or elſe becauſe they dare not trie any better, ſeeing they are ignorant of the preparations of their medecines. In the meane ſeaſon the purging power of theſe meane purgers may be greatly encreaſed with Spagyricall preparations by taking out of them that which is pure and ſeperating the feces which are contrarie to the


purging of mans bodie, & thereby will great profit follow. Firſt, for that the ſtomake will not be hurt with the medicine, when nothing ſhal hinder, but that it may performe his worke & ſpedily moue the bodie & be likewiſe moued of it againe. And ſecondly the ſick or diſeaſed perſon wil more eaſily a great deale take it, for that there is but a little quantity of the medicine, which are ſometimes found to be harde, that they had rather change life for death, then they would drinke vp whole cupfuls of thoſe troubled & thicke medicines, which the ſtomacke of many can not abide before they take them, or elſe is made ſo weake that it loathing them, do caſt them vp againe, and that with great trouble. True phiſitions therefore ſhould giue diligent heede to ſeeke out theſe preparations of medicines, both for their honour of the art of Phiſicke, & for the health of the diſeaſed. It is manifeſt that the eſſence of Rhabarb is of a purging Ex Rab

                        ill part, which is left in his decoction▪ ſo that thereby he looſeth his purging vertue, which by Phiſitions is taken out, if it be macerated in ſome thinne liquor by putting too white wine & Cinamom. They call this the infuſion of Rhabarbe, becauſe they do after a ſort draw out the force and eſſence of the Rhabarbe caſting away the ſeces. But by this methode following, that medicine will be made a great deale better and more profitable.
                     Beate thy Rhabarb to powder and put thereon the Alcool of wine that it may be couered foure fingers, then cloſe it faſt and ſet it to digeſt three or foure daies in Balneo, vntill the menſtrua be coloured, then powre it out & put on freſh, & do ſo vntil the menſtrua will be no more coloured, that the feces remaine white, all being well circulated according to art, ſeperat the menſtrua by Balneo, and the eſſence of the Rhabarbe will remaine in the bottom: then to euery ounce thereof ad oile of cinamon 2. ſcrup. of which if you giue 1. ſcrup. with a ſpoonfull of white wine, it doth purge more mightely then 1. oū. of the infuſion, & yet with leſſe trouble. This medicine may be miniſtred vnto children & to women with child & old men, and to thoſe that are weake through ſicknes. It purgeth and bringeth forth yellow choller. The feces or earth that doth remain is of a binding qualitie, and therfore it is preſcribed againſt Lienteria, Diſsenteria, & al
                              ••
                            fluoribus. But if any deſire to haue it purge more ſtronger, let him calcine the feces in a reuerberatorie, & then

with water draw forth his ſalt, & with reiterating his filteratiō

                         it wil bee purifyed like chriſtall: then caſt his eſſence that was drawen out vpon his alkaly, & digeſt him, & then diſtill him, for by this meanes the ſtrength of all medicines ſhall be increaſed.
                     So ſhal you prepare the extractiō of alloes, which doth purge

Agaricke being prepared after the ſame order doth purge chiefly fleame out of the ſtomack, meſenterion, liuer, ſpleen, and lungs from the braine and ſinewes, not ſo ſwiftly becauſe his power is weake. His doſe is 2. ſcrup. aſwell to the young as to the old, but becauſe it doth ſomwhat offend the ſtomake, it is corrected with the oile of ginger and ſpike. Thus may you haue out the extractiōs or eſſence of ſene, polypody, mechoacam, mirabolanes, and ſuch like, which you may miniſter to whom and when they be conuenient, by putting to them their proper corrections according to the qualitie of the ſicknes and the ſtrength of the diſeaſed.
                     Theſe are they which I purpoſed to ſet forth of the Spagiricall preparations, meaning ſhortly (God willing) to ſet forth greater thinges, that thereby thoſe that are ſtudious for true phiſicke, may enioy my labors, watchinges, and trauelles, and the profit that I haue gotten thereby through the talke of diuers learned men. Of which I thought good to ſhadow certaine thinges with certaine ſecret words of art, leſt I ſhould ſeeme raſhly to caſt forth thoſe pretious pearles heare ſet forth principally for the Spagyricall Phiſitions to the Sophiſters of all good diſcipline, and contemners of the ſecrets of nature, who when they haue gotten any commō or neuer ſo ſleight a thing out of the neaſt of Cadmi fillius, they contemne things vnknown, and are not afraide to raile at that art, and vnwiſelye to taunt with all kind of bitter words, at that which they neuer ſo much once did ſee.

                  IT preſerueth all things from putrifaction that is put therein or annointed therewith, as the naturall balme doth in all reſpectes.
                  If any bee touched with the peſtilence, ſo that the hart or braine be not infected, geue them ʒ 2. thereof to drinke, and annoint his ſtomacke with the ſame, & lay him downe to ſweat, and in once or twiſe vſing it, by the grace of God they ſhall be holpe, for it will ſuffer no venome to remaine within the body. Being taken in the aforeſaid order, it helpeth thoſe that haue ſurfeted by any meanes.
                  Being anointed on the ſtomacke morning & euening, it cauſeth an apetite, and conſumeth cold humors: alſo if you drinke thereof euery morning ʒ i. faſting, it will purge the head and ſtomacke of all ſuperfluous moiſture and ſharpeneth the ſight, if ye drop now and then one drop into the eie.
                  Being drunke as is aforeſaid, it helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the Rume, Catarre, cough and ſtitch in the ſide cauſed of winde.
                  Being put into the eare, it comforteth the ſight and hearing meruellouſly and all impediments in the head, and conſumeth all euill humors by his proper qualitie and nature, ſo that if ye vſe it, ye ſhall wonder at the operation. It helpeth all manner of woundes, in what place of the bodie ſoeuer they bee, if yee waſh them therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the ſame twiſe a day.
                  If yee waſh the Sciatica therewith, and lay thereon a cloth wet in the ſame, it taketh away the paine in very ſhort time.
                  It prouoketh vrine, and expelleth grauell in the raines, being drunk with parſlie water, or ſome conuenient licour: it is good againſt the Feuer Quartane, if ye drinke thereof 10 or 12. daies together euerie morning ʒ 1. or ʒ 2. after that the ſtomacke hath bene euacuated. It reſolueth all aches and ſwellinges, comming of cold, if ye bathe the place therwith. It helpeth the tooth ach, if ye hold it in your mouth ſo long as ye may ſuffer it. It helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the Cramp, or that haue their mouthes drawen awrie by that meanes▪ if they drinke a ſmal quantity and hold the ſame in their mouth, & annoint the partes therewith morning and euening.

It is moſt profitable for thoſe that are ſtrooke with the peſtilence, or that haue dronke poiſon, & for thoſe that are continually pained in the head, alſo it is very profitable againſt the dropſie, and water betweene the ſkinne and the fleſh, and thoſe that cannot fetch their breath, and againſt obſtruction of Menſtrua, maligne vlcers, the Pox, and ſuch like diſeaſes: it is either to bee eaten or drunke in wine, or a litle warme broth: itpurgeth both the ſtomacke and bodie of all noyſome humors.
