and true iudgement
of the moſte honorable
Sacrament
of Chriſtes body
& bloude
declared
both
by the auctorite of the
holy Scriptures
and the auncient
Doctores.
            Very neceſſary to be redde in this
tyme of all the faythfull.
         
         
            
               
COncernynge the dyſcorde
and varyaunce that is
ſpronge and daylye increaſeth of
the ſacrament of vnitie and vnderſtandynge of ye wordes of our ſauyour
chriſt ieſu, that no man ſhulde
be diſquieted or troubled in cōſcience,
me thought it neceſſarye to
wryte a ſhorte inſtruction wherin
by gods grace I ſhall ſo pacyfye
both the parties that without cō
               tencion
they ſhall admytte eche other
īto brotherly loue accordīg to
chriſtes exhortaciō, whiche wolde
haue vs to loue eche other as he
hath loued vs and wolde haue
loue to be the token of
his very diſciples and
faythfull folowers.

            The fyrſte Chapter proueth
that it is none article
of our fayth neceſſarye to
ſaluacion.
            
               Fyrſt we muſt all acknowleg
that it is none
article of our fayth whiche
can ſaue vs neyther
which we are boūd to beleue vnder
the payne of eternall dampnaciō,
for yf I ſhulde beleue yt his verye
naturall body both fleſhe & bloude
were materyally in the breade &
wyne, that ſhulde not ſaue me ſeynge
many beleue that, & receyue
it to theyr dampnacion. For it is
not his preſence in the bread that
can ſaue me, but his preſence ī my
harte thorowe fayth in his bloud,
which hath waſhed out my ſyn̄es
and pacefied the Fathers wrathe

towardes me. And agayne yf I do
not beleue yt his bodely preſence is
in the breade and wyne that ſhall
not dampne me. For it is not his
abſence out of the breade that can
dampne me, but the abſence out of
my hart thorowe vnbelefe now yf
they wolde here obiecte yt thoughe
it be truth that ye abſence out of the
bread of it ſelfe could not dampne
vs yet are we boūde to beleue it becauſe
of godes worde, which who
beleueth not as moche as in hym
is, he maketh god a lyar. And therfore
of an obſtinate mynde not to
beleue his wordes may be an occaſion
of dampnacion. To this we
maye anſwere yt we beleue goddes
worde and knowledge that it is
true, but in this we diſſente whether
it be true in the ſence that we
take it in, or in ye ſence that ye take

it in, And we ſay agayne yt though
ye haue as it appeareth vnto you
the euident wordes of Chriſt, and
therfore conſyſt in the barke of the
letter, yet are we compelled by cō
               ferryng
of the ſcriptures togither
to enter within the letter and to
ſearche out the mynde of our ſauiour
whiche ſpake the wordes, and
we ſaye thyrdly that we do it not
of an obſtinat mynde for he that defendeth
a thynge obſ
                  •
               inately whether
it be true or falſe, is euer to be
reprehended but we do it to ſatiſfis
oure conſciences whiche are cō
               pelled
by other places of Scripture
reaſons and doctors ſo to iudge
of it And euen ſo ought you to
iudge of your parte and to defende
your ſentences / not of an obſtinacy
for then ye offende) but for to ſatyſfie
your conſciēces as touching

the Scriptures whiche cauſe you
ſo to take it. And ſo ought nether
parte to diſpiſe the other, for eche
ſeketh the glory of God, & the true
vnderſtandynge of the ſcripture.
         
         
            The ſeconde Chapter ſheweth
the reaſon and ſcriptures whiche
cauſe vs otherwyſe to take it thē ye
cōmon multitud at this tyme do.
            
               REgarde we therfore
the precepte of our
mayſter chriſt euer noriſhyng
brotherly loue
in peace and vnitie, & yf ye can not
otherwyſe beare vs, yet admytte
vs as weake brethern. And as touchynge
the cauſes which compell
vs ſo to iudge, we knowe yt Chriſt
before his paſſion had a naturall
body, which he receyued of the vyrgyn

Mary thorow the power of ye
holy ghoſt. This body we ſay was
natural and not phantaſticall, but
had the qualyties of an other body
in all thyngꝭ ſaue ſynne, nether
was it more poſſible for that naturall
body ſo beyng mortal and not
gloryfied to be in dyuers places at
once, thē for myne. So that when
we heare theſe wordes ſpokē, this
is my body, and ſe that they were
ſpoken before his body was gloryfied,
knowyng alſo that a natural
body vngloryfied can not be in many
places at once, and that yf theſe
wordes were vnderſtandē as they
ſounde he ſhuld haue ben at ye leaſt
in .xij. or .xiij. places at once in his
Diſciples mouthes, and ſyttynge
at the table with them, It cauſeth
vs to loke better vpon it, and ſo to
ſearch out the pure vnderſtādyng

Nowe yf ye obiect that he myght
be in diuers places at once, Then
may we anſwere by the auctorytie
of ſaynt Auſten whiche ſayth. Corpus
in quo reſurrexit in vno loco
eſſe oporteth. His body wherin he
roſe muſt be in one place, and after
determyneth that it contynueth in
heauen, and ſhall ſo do vntyll the
tyme that he ſhall come to iudge
both quycke & deade. Nowe ſeyng
ſaynt Auſten ſayth that his body
(wherin he roſe muſt be ī one place
which was his glorified body (thē
may we wel ſay that his body not
gloryfied can not be ī many places
at once. And ſo muſt it nedes folowe
that he can not be there in fleſhe
& bloude. Beſydes that ye can
ſhewe no reaſon why he ſhulde be
in many places at once, and not in
all, but in all places at once he can

not be, wherfore we muſt cōclude
that he cannot be in many places
at once. If ye ſay that he maye be
in all places at once becauſe he is
alſo God. We anſwere that the
angel at the ſepulchre ſayd. Surrexit
nō eſt hic .i. He is ryſē, and is
not here. Wherfore yf ye ſay that
he is in all places, thē make ye the
Angell a lyar. Furthermore what
tyme he aſcēded the ſcripture teſtifieth
that a cloude toke hym out of
theyr ſyght, & that two men ſtode
by the Diſciples and ſayd ye men
of Galiley why ſtande ye gaſynge
vp into heauē? This ſame Ieſus
whiche is taken vp from you into
heauen ſhall ſo come euen as you
haue ſene hym go into heauē, here
we thynke verily that Chriſt ment
good earneſt. And yt in dede he was
taken vp from them into heauen

as the Angell teſtyfieth, & yt from
thenſe he ſhall come to iudge the
quicke and dead, as our Crede teacheth.
Nowe yf ye can perſwade
your owne conſciences and vnderſtande
the Scriptures yt he playde
boo pype with his Diſciples, and
dyd but make hym ſelfe inuiſible
onely. Thā may ye take your pleaſures,
for Chriſte teacheth vs not
to be contentious.
         
         
            The thyrde Chaptre declareth
why Chriſte vſeth ſuche maner of
ſpeache, and the pure vnderſtandynge
of Chriſtes wordes.
            
               IF ye wolde then
axe vs why chriſt ſhulde
ſo ſaye: & vſe theſe playne
wordes yf he wolde
that it ſhulde be ſpiritually vnderſtande.

To this we anſwere that
it is the maner both of chriſt and
his ſcriptures ſo to ſpeake for dyuers
conſyderacions: Chriſte calleth
hymſelfe a very vyne & his diſcyples
vyne braunches wherwith
he hath ſo ꝑfectly ſet out his power,
that a thouſande wordes coulde
not expreſſe hym ſo lyuely. For
where he ſayeth I am a very vyne
there declareth he ſenſyble that
as verely as the braūches of a naturall
vyne can brynge forth no
frute except they cōtynewe in the
vyne, euen ſo can his diſcyples do
nothyng except they abyde ī hym
Now where he ſayth that he is a
very vyne, he wolde not haue you
bounde to beleue for an artycle of
the fayth, that he were a naturall
vyne. But had leuer that ye vnderſtande
it miſtically that there is a

certein proꝑtie in this vine which
doth ſolyuely expreſſe hym that he
can put no difference (for yt poynte)
betwene a vine & hym ſelfe but calleth
hym ſelfe euen a very vyne we
vſe it alſo in cōmon ſpeache. If a
man ſe his neyghboures horſe hauynge
a certen properte which his
horſe hath, then wyll he ſay this is
my horſe vp and downe, not meanynge
that the ſubſtaunce of his
neyghbours is his own horſe, but
that there is a certaine propertie ī
his neyghbours, whiche is ſo lyke
his that they coulde not decerne
the one from the other. Lykewyſe
Chriſte calleth hym ſelfe a doore,
not that he hym ſelf is a material
doore, but bycauſe the dore hath a
certen propertie whiche doth well
deſcribe hym. For as no man can
come within a ſtronge holde but

by the doore, Euen ſo can no man
come vnto the father but thorow
Chriſt, and for this propertie doth
he call hym ſelfe a doore. And this
doth he to expreſſe euen to our outwarde
ſenſes what powre he hath
and what profite commeth to vs
thorowe hym and euen ſo in this
Sacrament he calleth the breade
his body and the wyne his bloude
not that the breade and wyne are
his naturall fleſhe and bloude, but
for certayne properties whiche are
in them.
            For he toke the bread and brake
it and cōmaunded them to eate it,
ſayng this is my body which ſhall
be gyuen for you. This do in remē
               braūce
of me. As thoughe he ſhuld
haue ſayd theſe wordes. Nowe is
the tyme come yt I muſte departe
from you. Neuertheleſſe I ſhall

gyue you ſuche a perfyct token before
I go, that ye ſhall not doubte
but that I am yours. Loo I ſhall
be put to death and my body broken
euē as ye ſe this bread brokē.
Neuertheles by ye not diſmayde.
Take this bread, and eate it, and
ſwalow it downe into your belyes
for this breade ſhall be vnto you
euen my very body which ſhall be
gyuen for you. For as verely as year
partakers of this bread which
by youre ſenſes ye knowe ye haue
within you, euen as ſurely ſhall ye
be partakers of my bodye whiche
ſhall be crucyfied for you, thoughe
it were done a thouſande myle frō
you, wherfor ye nede not to doubt
nor feare in myne abſence, ſeynge
that the frute of my death ſhall be
as verelye youres, as this breade
whiche ye haue within you, but yf

ye ſhuld fal into any myſtruſt, then
breke ye amonge youre ſelues this
bread, & eate it in the remēbraūce
of me, that it maye certyfie euen
your ſenſes yt you are partakers of
my body thorowe fayth, as verely
as ye are partakers of this bread
thorowe eatynge of it.
         
         
            The fourth Chapter noteth another
maner of ſpeache & proueth
our expoſytion by a proper ſimylytude
of the brydgrome & bryde.
            
               THis is the pure vnderſtandyng
of Chriſtes
wordes, whiche manye
auctoryties cauſe vs to
receyue, and alſo that it is the cō
               mon
phraſe of ye ſcripture no man
can deny, whiche is but meanelye
excercyſed in it. We rede yt Iacob

buylded an alter, & called it God,
the god of Iſraell, we rede alſo yt
Iacob wraſtled wt an angell & called
the place Pem
                  •
               ll .i. The face of
God, we reade yt the paſch lambe
was called the paſſynge by of the
Lorde with infynite other of ſuch
Phraſes. Howe be it I thynke no
man ſo innocent that he wolde cō
               tende
and affyrme yt the very alter
was the god of Iſraell, or ye place
where he wraſtled to be the verye
face of God, or the naturall lambe
to be the paſſynge by of the Lorde,
but ſuch names are gyuē that as
ſoone as we heare thē we myghte
knowe what was ment by them.
As by example he called alter the
god of Iſraell, that euen the very
name it ſelfe ſhulde teſtyfie that it
was made to put vs ī remēbraūce
of the very God of Iſraell. Lykewyſe

the place where he wraſtled
was called the face of God, that ye
very name it ſelfe myghte put vs
in remēbraunce that there Iacob
had wraſtled with God, & had ſene
hym face to face. Alſo the lambe
was called paſouer or the paſſyng
by of the lorde, that the very name
it ſelfe myght put vs in remēbraū
               ce
that the lorde paſſynge by had
ſlayne all the fyrſte begotten in Egept.
And euen ſo to oure purpoſe
the bread is called the bodye, that
the very name it ſelfe, myght put
vs in remembraūce that his very
body was broken for vs And is as
verely ours thorowe fayth as the
bread is ours by eatyng of it. And
therfore added he alſo theſe wordꝭ
This do in remembraunce of me,
whiche thynge expoundeth all togyther
yf we had wytte.
            
               
If a brydegrome whiche had promyſed
fayth & trouth to his bryde
ſhulde depart into a farre coūtree
for neceſſary buſynes that he hath
then to cōfort his brydes harte he
wolde ſaye on this maner. I muſt
departe into a farre coūtree for vrgēt
maters. Neuertheleſſe I ſhal
leaue you ſuch a tokē that ye ſhall
be as ſure of me, as though I were
here preſent with you. Take this
rynge & put it on youre fynger for
it is my fayth & my trouth whiche
I haue promiſed to kepe with you
And therfore kepe it ī remēbraūce
of me. And as ſurely as you haue
this rynge on youre fynger, ſo ſure
may you be of me that I ſhall not
dyceyue you. So that yf ye ſhulde
any thyng myſtruſt me. Then beholde
the ryng which is my fayth
and trouth, & it ſhall certyfye euen

your outwarde ſenſes that I am
youres. And moche more is this
trew in the Sacramēt, for a man
may repent hym of his promes, &
dyceyue his bryde, but Chriſte can
not repent hym of his gracious fauour,
wher wt he loueth vs, he can
be no lyar, nether can deceyue vs.
And therfore we nede not to doubt
of his promes.
         
         
            ¶The fyfth Chapter ſheweth the
maner how it ought to be receued.
            
               HEre alſo muſte
we touche ſome what
as concernyng the receyuyng
of it for therin
are many vexed ſome be ſo fearfull
to breake Chriſtes inſtitutiō,
whiche gaue it in both the kyndes
that they wholly abſtayne & dare

not come at it. Excepte the prieſt
wold gyue it cōſerrat in both kyndes,
and ſome there are that neuer
ſtycke at it, but receyue they wote
not what hauyng no reſpecte vnto
Chriſtes inſtitution And both are
deceyued, albeit the fyrſt are more
to be alowed, bycauſe they moſt ſorow
to breake Goddes ordinas;ice.
But I wyll ſhewe you a meanes
howe ye ſhall euer receyue it accordyng
to Gods inſtitutiō, although
the prieſt wold withdraw it from
you. Fyrſte ye nede to haue no reſpect
vnto ye prieſtes wordes which
myniſtreth it. For yf ye remembrs
for what entēt Chriſt dyd īſtitute
the ſacrament and knowe that it
was to put vs in remembraūce of
his body breakynge and bloudſhedyng
& that it was done for oure
wealthe, & we as ſure of it thorow

beleuynge it (accordyng to his promeſſe)
as we are ſure of the breade
by eatynge of it. If as I ſay ye remembre
this thing (for which entent
onely the prieſt ſpeaketh theſe
wordes thē yf ye Prieſt leaue out
theſe wordꝭ or parte therof he cannot
hurte you, for ye haue already
the effecte and fynall purpoſe for
which he ſhulde ſpeake them. And
agayne yf he ſhuld wholy alter thē
yet can he not deceyue you, For thē
are ye ſure that he is a lyar. And
therfore whē he bryngeth the Sacrament
vnto me, I wyll cōſyder
chriſtes mynde & inſtitutiō & nor ye
prieſtes wordes. And wyll thanks
my heuenly father, ſaying on this
maner. Blyſſed be thou moſt dere
and mercyfull father which of thy
tender fauour and benignitie (notwithſtandyng
our greuous enormyties

cōmytted agaīſt ye (vouchſauedeſt

pytie cōſyderynge oure myſerable
eſtate wyllyngly tokeſt vpon the to
haue thy moſte innocent body broken
and bloudſhede to purge and
waſhe me whiche am laden with
iniquite. And to certyfie vs therof
haſte lefte vs not onely thy worde,
whiche may inſtructe oure hartes
but alſo a viſible token to certyfie
euen our outwarde ſenſes of this
great beneficte that we ſhuld not
doubt but that thy body and frute
of thy paſſion are oures as ſurely
as the bread whiche by our ſenſes
we know that we haue withī vs.
Bleſſed be alſo that ſpirit of veritie.

whiche is ſent from God oure
father thorowe our ſauyour chriſt
Ieſu to lyghtē our darke ignoraū
               ces

            Thus ſhalte thou receyue it accordynge
to Chriſtes inſtitution &
though chouſe that the prieſt bringeth
wyne vnconſecrate, yet neuer
ſtycke at that, for as ſurely ſhall it
certyfie thy conſyence & outward

therby) as though he made a thouſande

bleſſynges ouer it, and loke

and euen the ſame mayſt thou verify
