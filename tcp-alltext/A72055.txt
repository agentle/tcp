                     That PEERE, that SPOUSE, that IEMM most excellent
                     Whom by a SACRED number, I prove can
                     A threefolde QVEENE, a threefolde CHRISTI-ANNE
                     And by vniting THREE againe to ONE
                     I maye affirme SHEE'S paraleld by none
                     But is the EMPRESSE of true MAIESTIE
                     Whom (GOD preſerue) nowe and Eternally.
