               Fathers and Mothers Halfe, by Princely Line,
            
            Wel-nigh vn-pattern'd Patterne of rare Parts,
            
            Whō, though Few equall, All Loue in their harts:
            These Princely Parts, whence had they this great growth
            From Fathers Loines or Mothers Paps? From Both.
            Be still, (as th' art) Parents Idea right;
            Let none thee equall in such Princely Light:
            That being Vertues Prince and Principall,
            Heauen may Thee Blesse with Blisse Angelicall,

            THE TRANSLATOR to the most Worthy and weldeseruing Author.
            
            
               TRue Imitation of mens worthy Deedes
            
            From Loue of them (as I suppose) proceedes:
            Yet many-times Ambitious Emulation
            
            May in such Actions staine True Imitation.
            
            But vnto me, Loue was the Golden-Spurre,
            
            If otherwise, I might iust shame incurre:
            For what I should I could not; what I could
            I heere haue done, though farre from what I would.
            Thy wit therefore braue Epigramatist,
            
            To prayse condignely, in me can't consist.
            Yet that I 
                  Epig. 2. Lib. Pri.
                may not Enuious bee deem'd,
            Not caring though I be a Foole esteem'd.
            Some thus I Prayse, and thus their praise doe write,
            I'le none Disprayse, most vndone passe my might.
            Excuse heerein (kind Sir) what's Mis-committed,
            
            And pardon mee, if ought be Ill-omitted.
            
            
               Thine in the vnlimited limits of Loue, IO. VICARS.

               ANtèus-like I long haue fought a fight:
            But, find in conflict a Superiour might.
            Oft haue I wrastled, but still foild and fell'd
            By▪ my Competitor am farre excell'd.
            Witnesse my weaknesse in this last assault,
            Forc'd heere and there to tyre, retyre and hault.
            And marueile not, (kind Readers) though I sweat,
            Hauing to doe with this Alcides great.
            Whose Policie and Power I haue found such,
            As ere to equallize is too-too-much:
            But heer's my comfort, though those Champions fought
            With Ire most dire to th'Death to fight it out,
            Yet our Contention is with sweet desire,
            My Authors Loue and Thine how to acquire:
            Which if I gaine, as tis my Hope I shall,
            I'le not thus flie, but trie another fall.
