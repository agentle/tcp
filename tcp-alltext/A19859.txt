But in this caſe may it pleaſe your Lo. likewiſe to conſider. That the Prelats (whom you haue heard againe and againe) do preſſe iudgment vpon their heaped informacions, and yet concerning them, M.

And therefore there is great reaſon, that before you certifie her Maieſtie: your Lo. ſhould ſatisfie your owne conſcience by reading theſe his collected defences: wherby the principall allegations (if not all of any force) vrged on Whitſoneue, are ſeuerally and (I am perſwaded) fully and truly anſwered.

If then not reſpect of perſons, is it for that this cauſe is proceded in ex officio, and not 
                  •
               udicially as a cauſe betwene party and party? Indeed it is to officiouſly proceeded in, but the truth is, The cauſe is betweene party and party: I ſay not betwene a faithfull ſervant of Ieſus and a periured Boy, but betwene Michaell and the old Serpent, Chriſt Ieſus and the envious man. For Ieſus pleadeth (by M. Dorrell) that his great name, which ought to bee glorious among all Chriſtians is highly diſhonored, by calling into queſtion his mighty power in caſting out Divells at the prayer and faſting of his holy people. On the contrary parte Satan, who long ſince moved the Phariſees (even againſt their own conſciences) to charge Chriſt with caſting out of Diuells by the power of Belzebub, doth eftſoons (by his inſtruments) traduce ſuch diſpoſſeſſion pretending it to bee but very counterfaiting. If then a loyall Iudge will diligently heare whatſoeuer can be ſaid in behalfe of her Maieſtie in a cauſe wherein ſhe is pretended to be a party, much more religiouſly will your Lo. (being a Chriſtian Iudge) heare whatſoeuer can bee ſaid in the behalfe of Ieſus, in a cauſe wherin he is pretended to be a party. And whether the name of Ieſus be more glorified (indeede) by vndoubted diſpoſſeſſion, or pretended counterfaiting, your faithfull hart cā quickly iudge. If by vndoubted diſpoſſeſſion, then as good policy as that, whereby M. Moore is not called into any queſtion about the diſpoſſeſſion of 7. in Lancaſhire, might direct Chriſtian Magiſtrates to bend their authority rather to manifeſt the Glory of Chriſte, then (altogeather) to obſcure the ſame by pretended counterfaiting.

For perceiving the people hereby occaſioned to take Ieſus for the Sonne of David, he moved the Phariſees to traduce the ſame as before is ſaid▪ and contrariwiſe Ieſus conceiving how highly this miracle concerned the glorie of his Name, did never take his owne part more earneſtly then in iuſtifying the ſame. From whence wee may learne▪ that Chriſt his people ſhould ſhew forth the vertue of him, by whoſe name they are called Chriſtians in mainteyning his cauſe ſo much the more reſoluſly, as Satan by his inſtruments ſhall oppoſe himſelfe malitiouſly. But ſo it is in this cauſe: For Satan perceiving thouſands of the beſt profeſſors (among whom not a few be honorable, worſhipfull, & learned) occaſioned by the diſpoſſeſſion of Sommers and 9. other to glorifie the name of Ieſus, yea ſo, that Nottingham (heretofore not ſo forward) became (for a time) very zealous (as I heare) in hearing the worde: Satan (I ſay) perceiving ſuch a conſequent of diſpoſſeſſion, moved ſundry adverſaries to traduce the ſame as Papiſts who deny any ſuch power to be in our Churrh, Atheiſts who ſcorne whatſoever tendeth to prove that there is a God or a Divel, But eſpecially certeine Prelates, who (being groſſer in their conceipt then the Phariſees) by diſcrediting 12. ſufficient Commiſſioners, 6. worſhipfull Gentlemen, and 6. learned Preachers, by ſuppreſſing 17. ſufficient depoſitions, by withhoulding M. Dorr. from anſwering at large for himſelfe, make it (forſooth) a matter of counterfaiting. And yet I muſt needes ſay that the L. B. of London (as I haue heard) was fumbling about ſome proofe▪ That M Dorrell did caſt out Divells by witchraft or coniuration But (belike) he remembreth, that ſo he might overthrow his firſt pretended counterfaiting. Theſe thinges well weighed, it followeth that all Chriſtians ought to take this cauſe to heart: and to further the manifeſtation of truth, no leſſe zealouſly thē the Prelats would obſcure it indirectly. If all Chriſtians, then eſpecially it behoveth your L. ſo to do, having authority even in that caſe. But the rather becauſe all the godly (whoſe deſire to bee ſatisfied is not to be deſpiſed) attribute moſt to your L. faithfulnes, yea the Prelates ſeeme to lay the burthen on your H. For Miſtris Dorrell and Miſtr Moore ſuing to the L.

            Secondly in Chriſt his apologeticall diſcourſe your Lo. may conſider ſundry forcible reaſons to perſwade due regard of the Lordes worke ſo wonderfull in our eyes, if we will not caſt a vaile before them. Which be theſe: Firſt Chriſt iuſtifieth diſpoſſeſſion with vnaunſwerable argumentes in the Mat. 1
                     •
                  
                25.26.27. verſes, and then hee reproveth the traducing thereof. Concerning the former I refer your Lo. to theſe Collections. The reproofe Chriſt proſecuteth by noting the offendours, and by cenſuring the ſinne. Hee noteth (as with a blacke cole) the offendours, in the 33.34 35. verſes, where he thus argneth, An evill tree cannot bringe foorth good fruite. Therefore no merveill though envious Phariſees traduce the Spirit or Finger of God. To apply: Lordly Biſhopes in the iudgment of moſt, if not of all learned Preachers of the Goſpell in England, France, Scotlande▪ and the low Countryes (except Soul-killing non-reſidents, and ambitious aſpirers to to the Prelacy) are plants which (in reſpect of their eccleſiaſticall dignitie) the heavenly Father hath not planted in his Church by the hande of his Sonne:Mat. 28.18 19. Eph. 4.8.1

                who onely (having all power committed to him) appointeth what callinges eccleſiaſticall hee thinketh beſt for the building of his Church. If this iudgement be found, then better proceedings then theſe againſt M Dorrell cannot be ordinarily expected from them, eſpecially againſt ſuch as deſire the Church to bee reformed of the Romiſh Hierarchy and Ceremonies enforced. As for your Lo. better fruits are expected from the ſame, as from a tree planted in the Courts of the Lord, and that by his owne right hand.
            The ſinne is cenſured by diſcouering either the corruption, or  danger thereof. The former is performed by proving wherein, and ſhewing againſt whom the offence is committed. Chriſt proveth wherein, after this manner in the 28. and 29. verſes. Only the Kingdome (that is the ſouveraigne power) of God can caſt the ſtrong & envious man out of his poſſeſſ

               ō: therefore in traducing diſpoſſeſſion, ye traduce ye kingdom of God. This argument applyeth it ſelf. I therfore only admoniſh you to think of it ſeriouſly: & the rather, Becauſe Atheiſts abound in theſe dayes and witchcraft is called into queſtion. Which error is confirmed by denying diſpoſſeſſion▪ & both theſe errors confirm Atheiſts mightily▪ For thus wil they gather if 11. poſſeſſed (at ſundry times & in ſundry places) were all counterfeits, why ſhould we thinke there is any poſſeſſ

Againſt himſelfe in reſpect of the matter to wit the very ſlandering of diſpoſſeſſion, arguing to this purpoſe in the 30. verſ. My Royall authoritie is ſo great, that whoſoever is not with me is againſt mee: much more ye, who traduce ſo glorious an effect of my Kingly power.

They therefore comming to my handes by occaſion, I thought it a great iniurie to ſuppreſſe them, and ſo the godly to bee depriued of that benefite which no doubt may come by them. Not that I would be more careles in offending then the Authour, but that I preſume the right Honorable L. chief Iustice will take no offence to be admoniſhed and rightly informed in a matter ſo highly touching not onely the good name of one man, but euen the credit of the Goſpell, and the glory of Christ him ſelfe: and wherein his L. hath had and is to haue an eſpeciall ſtroke, but as yet by the iniurious dealing of ſome of the Prelates (eſpecially the L. B. of Lond.) hath not fully nor ſufficiently heard the ſame. Hoping the rather of his L. patience heerein, for that his H. (ſince the laſt hearing of the matter at Lambeth on Whitſon eve laſt) namely in his circuit in Suff. did heare euidently proued vnto him, that a Maid there was handled and tormented very grieuouſly, in many things as Sommers and the rest were. Whether it may be called Poſſeſsion or Obſeſsion, or any other proper name, I for my part will not ſtrive, (neither is it materiall) but will leaue it to bee decided by the learned. Onely this may ſuffice, that they were fearfull and ſtraunge vexations of the Devill in Gods diſpleaſure against vs, whiche could not poſsibly be done by any humane

wayes or means whatſoeuer: which is the very maine point in controverſie. For the further and more manifest clearing whereof, and for the ſatisfying of all ſuch as are indifferently carried in this cauſe, I haue thought good to adde to the ende of this Treatiſe, a brief Narration of thoſe accidentes which befell the ſaid Maid in Suffo. Wherein neither M. Dorr. nor any of his friendes 
                  •
               ad dealing, and therefore the more materiall for their clearing in their cauſe.
            Preſuming therefore on the lawful fauour of that Honorable & worthy Iudge, I am withall the rather imboldned to publiſh theſe Collections. First, becauſe (being my ſelf an eare-witnes at Lambeth on Whitſon eve last, when the 
                  •
               llegations in this Treatiſe mentioned were obiected againſt M. Dorrell, & comming thither with an indifferent minde to be ſatisfyed in the truth (yea rather I protest mistrusting M
                  •
                Dorr. then otherwiſe) I heard and ſaw to my great grief, that he co

                  •
               ed (although very humbly & earnestly he intreated the ſame) to make his particular defences to the ſaid allegations as they were laid to his charge: but was ſtill fro time to time 
                  •
               ut off by the L. B. of London eſpecially, in the very materiall & maine pointes which 
                  •
               ended to his clearing yea alſo in th
                  •
               ſe which the L. chief Iustice (very honorably) ſeemed deſirous to be ſatisfyed in. Who would now & then giue him leaue to ſpeak yet could not heare him to any purpoſe, being ſtill interrupted by the L. B. of Lond who fed him with theſe wordes, Staye, heare another matter, you ſhalbe heard at large anon. &c. and yet not then neyther ſuffred him to make his apologie, ſaue only to an obiection or 2. Which was to ſo good purpoſe, & tended

ſo directly to his clearing in the waightiest matters against him, that I doubt not if he had bene permitted to proceede in the rest, he would haue ſatisfied or at least giuen cauſe of ſuſpenſe vnto the H. and Wor. there aſſembled. But being in the chief ma
                  •
               ter and that which touched the quicke, the L. B. of Cant. or Lond. interrupted him ſaying, My LL. I thinke i
                  •
                not fit he ſhould be ſuffered thus to goe on. For what cauſe, I doubt not but thoſe of diſcretion both did and can iudge well enough.
            Another reaſon and that (not the least) mooving me to publiſh this Treatiſe, is becauſe I heare that the L. of Lond. is writing a booke against Mr Dorell. Now I doubt not theſe Collections will in ſome meaſure (though briefly) anſwer all the obiections of any moment which he ſhall publiſh. Onely we doubt that he will, as he did at the ſaid last hearing, curt all the Depoſitions of ſuch perſons as by reexamining may ſeeme in ſome things to make against M
                  •
                Dorell, (which yet in ſome thinges being layde togeather doe make much for him) leaving out altogeather that which by the ſame Deponents might ſerue to cleare him any way. Which thing if he doe againe, it will proove but a trick of his In his booke of

                  •
                Dorell will (if he may be permitted) ſufficiently defend him ſelfe at large, if occaſion require. In the meane time this ſmal diſcourſe may ſerve I truſt, in ſome ſteed, ſith he being a Priſoner, can not do

            Allegations Againſt Mr DORRELL, Made at Lambeth
               the 26. of May. 1599.
With ſuch DEFENCES as are made in his behalfe.
            
               HE challengeth to him ſelfe a ſingular 
                     allegation 1 gift to cast out Divells for vaine glory ſake.
            
            1. Mr Dorrell his profeſſion is, that howſoever 
                  defense 1 it hath pleaſed the Lord to vſe his poore Miniſtery of prayer, &c. in the diſpoſſeſſion of ſundry: Yet he doth not challenge (neither ever did) anie ſpeciall gift therein aboue the leaſt of his brethren, or anie private Chriſtiā; and his practiſe (anſwerable to that profeſſion) doth manifeſt the contrary to that frivolous imputation. Which alſo may be witneſſed by his letters to Mr 
               Starkey in Lancaſhire, and to Mr 
               Aldridge of Nottingham, by thouſandes that have heard him in Pulpit diſclaime ſuch a gifte, by 16. Miniſters in Leycester ſhiere that vrged him to goe to the 7. in Mr 
               Starkeys houſe▪ by other Preachers, & by Darlings friends that could not entreat him to ioine with them in faſting, &c.
            2. But admit vainglory (whereof yet God 
                  defense 2
               
is only Iudge) it may reprove the perſon, but not overthrowe the cauſe.
            
               
                  allegation 2
               Mr Dorrell taught 4. to counterfeite, viz: Katherine Wright of Ridg way lane in the County of Darby, Tho. Darling of Burton in the County of Stafford, Mary Couper, & William Sommers of Nottingham. For the ſignes of poſſeſſiō & diſpoſſeſſiō were alike in all. Therefore theſe 4. and 7. in Lā
                  caſhire were counterfectes, and taught by Mr Dorrell.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. Beſides his Negatiue oath (which alſo Maiſter Browne. M. Porter. M. Evington. M Brinſley 4. grave, godly, and learned Divines offered to confirme as compurgators according to the lawe) Mr Dorrell ſolemly proteſteth, that he is moſt free from teaching any to counterfeit either poſſeſſion or diſpoſſeſſion. 
                  defense 2 2. In ordinary courſe of law the affirmatiue part proveth, but in this courſe the affirmatiue is ſuppreſſed, & the negative enforced. For in this cauſe cōcerning a matter of fact, Mr Dorrell ſhould proove that there was vndoubted poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſion. But that will not be admitted. 
                  defense 3 3. The 7. in Lancaſhire are ſpokē of to no other purpoſe but to imply; that for the reaſon of like handling, if the other 4. were counterfets, then theſe 7. were likewiſe. Which Mr 
               Dorrell graunteth & retorteth

thus: If thoſe 7. had the ſame ſignes of poſſeſſion & diſpoſſeſſion; if they were cured by the ſame meanes, to wit, by faſting and prayer, and if they did not counterfet, then is it likely that Mr Dorr. did not teach the other 4. to counterfeit. But the 2. former are graunted to haue ben at leaſt in ſhew. And M. Dorrell preſumeth no counterfeiting can bee imagined in them. Becauſe then the L. B. of London, who hath labored (night and day) to prove the other 4. to be counterfeits, ſent his purſivant for ſom to be examined, and addreſſed Harſenett his examiner, and Pigott his ſecretary to Cheſterfeild in Darbyſhire there to examine Katherine Wright her poſſeſſion, which was 12. years agoe, would not have loſt ſo great a pray, having had a large diſcourſe thereof, but would haue made ſom ſhew of proofe or at leaſt demaunded ſom anſwer from M. Dorr. touching the ſame, and charged M. Moore therewith (againſt whom hee wanted matter) or (in ſo long time of impriſonment) examined them partners in that diſpoſſeſſion) about the ſame. But (belike) the L. B. of London vnderſtanding 2. of the 7. were but 10. years old, & therefore could not poſſibly counterfeit ſo ſtrange thinges; knowing Jane

Aſhton (an other of the 7) is repoſſeſſed, & by Popiſh Prieſtes made a ſpectacle to Papiſtes; reading M
                  •
                
               Starkey (the gentleman in whoſe houſe the 7. were) his confident lettre to the L. B. of Cheſter, who by the direction (as he ſaid) of one in great place, (belike the L.B. of London) required true certificate; and hearing (it may be) the report of ſundry of credit in Lancaſhire, thought that caſe to be cleare, and therefore hurtfull to the reſt of his proceedings 
                  defense 4 if it were drawen into queſtion. 4. If many thinges were donne or ſuffered by theſe 4: which cannot poſſiblie be coūterfetted, then Mr. Dorrell could not teach them: if not them, why the reſt? But ſuch things he proved to be donne or ſuffered by Sommers: and may be proved (if commiſſion were graunted) by the reſt. Therefore M. 
                  defense 5 Dorrell did not teach them. 5. If Maiſter Dorrell did teach all 4. why is not time & place (neceſſary circumſtances) ſpoken of in the 3. firſte ſuppoſed counterfeits, but only in the laſt? For if he did teach them, there muſt needes bee a time when, and a 
                  defense 6 place where, he did teach them. 6. The reaſon doth not prove that Maiſter Dorrell taught any to conterfeit: for by the ſame reaſon Chriſt may be convinced of the

ſame ſinne, which were impiety to admit. Sith ſundry by him diſpoſſeſſed had the like ſignes as our ſuppoſed Counterfeites had, Mar. 1.24.26. & 9.18.20.26. Lu. 4.35.
            7 Indeed Mai. Dorr. graunteth that the 
                  defense 7 like handling may argue the ſame teacher or handler, as the like proper ſymptomes may argue the ſame cauſe. But any religious and reaſonable mā may argue the Divell to be that teacher or handler: conſidering the ſignes of poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſeſſion in theſe 4. were like to thoſe poſſeſſed in Chriſts time, and ſome of them not poſſible to be counterfeited.
            
               Catharin Wright depoſeth counterfeiting.
               
                  allegation 3
            
            Firſt her ſuppoſed feates were either impoſſibilies,
                  defense 1 or ſuch as any (not wilfully bent to ſpeak againſt his owne perſwaſiō) would ſay they were the effectes of an vncleane Spirit, and not counterfeitings: viz. 1. In her fits ſhe was ſo oft caſt into the fire and water, that ſhee was chained to a poſt. 2. She was caſt into ſundry wels, yet being ſought and found was without hurt. 3. otherwiſe (as by cutting her throate) ſhee would haue deſtroyed her ſelfe. 4. Trāces ſupernaturall. 5. Strength. 6. Knowledge. 7. Swelling ſo as her body and necke were ſwollen twiſe as big as they were wont to

be. 8. A thing (as if quick) felt ſtirring vp and down in her body: and drink brought in her thirſt (in moſt ſtrange ſort) ſprouted out of the cup vp to the roofe of the parlor. 
                  defense 2 2. Catherine Wright diſpoſſeſſed by Prayer, was repoſſeſſed and ſo continued from the 18. to the 30. yeare of her age, or thereabout. In all which time it is marvel that none could perceave her counterfeiting before Harſenet came, nor ſhee bee wearie thereof: ſith thereby ſhe is deprived of Mariage, and other cōforts of this life. 
                  defense 3 3. All this while ſhe hath dwelled with her Father and Mother in an obſcure place, where ſhe hath not, nether can reape profit 
                  defense 4 by her counterfeiting. 4. Since her cō
               feſſion, ſhee doeth, or ſuffered the ſame things ſtill. Therefore to bee puniſhed, or 
                  defense 5 to be reputed no counterfeit. 5. If ſhe had not confeſſed, Harſenet, &c. threatned to burne her feet. But preſently after ſhe cam from the Cōmiſſioners ſhe bewayled her 
                  defense 6 periurie. 6. Ma. Ed. Beersfoord examined vpon oath would have ſet downe ſome of the ſtrange thinges he ſawe, but Harſenet caſt away the paper, ſaying, If you will have a miracle you ſhall aunſwer it before 
                  defense 7 my L. of London. 7. But let it be admitted that ſhe confeſſing the counterfeiting of

impoſſibilities, ſaieth true. What is this to M. Dorrell, who had never ſeene her before ſhee was brought to Maunsfield, (where M. Dorr. dwelt) by one Ma. Beckingham (Parſon of Bilſtrop) his appointment, of whom helpe was expected, after it had ben ſought for of one Arthur a Cō
               iurer: who, after he had raiſed a Divell (in a likenes not remembred,) was inſtantly apprehended by the L. Darcies meanes.
            
               Katherine Wright hath depoſed that at 
                     allegation 4 Maunsfield Dorrell bad hir anſwer in a ſtraunge voice, and ſay Middlecub, when he ſhould aske the name of the Spirit.
            
            1. Mai. Dorrell denyeth that, or any other 
                  defense 1 ſuch inſtruction, as he ſhall anſwere at the dreadful day of iudgemēt: which he thinketh (all circumſtances conſidered) ſhall countervaile her inforced oath, & the rather ſith none other doth witnes the ſame. 2. But this is to ſmall purpoſe were it true:
                  defense 2 it only ſheweth that M▪ Dorrell taught her to vſe ſome wordes in her ſuppoſed counterfeiting renued, which he calleth repoſſeſſion, and not her former feates. Which wordes a boy can teach her, wheras it paſſeth Dorrells skill to teach thoſe ſtraunge things ſpoken of before. 3. Kather. Wright

                  •
               fter ſhe had forſworne her ſelfe, was touched

in conſcience, ſorrowfully confeſſed her periury, and was in moſt miſerable taking through trouble of minde becauſe of the ſame. Of her recovery I doe not heare.
            
               
                  allegation 5
               Dorrell lay on Katherine Wrights belly, and was ſo foūd by one Beckingham a Minister, who plucked him of by the heeles, & thruſt him out of the Chamber. Which lying M: Dorrell hath depoſed to haue bene, in imitation of Elias and Paule.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. In deed the L.B. of London examined M. Dorrell vpon his oath, wherfore he lay vpon or beſide Kathar. Wright, & though M. Dorrell anſwered that hee did not well remēber the reaſon of a matter of no moment donne 12. or 13. yeares agoe, yet the L.B. would needes haue preſent aunſwere one or other, M. Dorr. thus vrged did anſwer, that it might be in ſome childiſh imitation of the Prophet and the Apoſtle, becauſe (at that time) he was yong in age, & Divinitie. But whē he had better thought of the matter, he remembred him ſelfe, returned withal convenient ſpeed he could, and vpō his oath abſolutely denying ſuch 
                  defense 2 imitation, confidently affirmed, 2. That he lay not vpon her belly but on her ſide, and that was to helpe one Edward Loade
                     •
                  
               
               
(who by him ſelf tryed in vayne) to keepe her downe in her fitt; That Beckingham was not preſent when that lying was; and that many women (and amongſt the reſt M. Dorr. owne wife) were then preſent in the roome, which was no Chamber. All which M. Dorr. can prove ſufficiently.
            3. Harſenet was earneſt with Kath. Wright 
                  defense 3 as to accuſe her ſelfe to be a coūterfeit, ſo to charge helfe and M. Dorrell with this filthy ſhame: wherevnto ſhe could not be drawen by any meanes. 4. But the allegation 
                  defense 4 admitted (though it be not cōfirmed by the depoſition of any other then Beckingham) proveth not the matter of teaching to counterfeit, but onely depraveth the perſon which in deed can not be: and the rather becauſe this ſhameles lyer ſhortly after his periury, went vp & downe the Country bereft of his wittes, and died in lamentable ſorte. And yet Barlow, the L. B. of Cant. Chapleyne, could not ſpare ſo groſſe a lye when he commenſed Doctor,

               uch is his charitie, ſuch his divinitie.
            
               Thomas Darling confeſſeth that he coun

            1. That Cōfeſſion was inforced by Har
                  
                     •

               im, that he ſhould be hanged as the Burgunnian
               
was (to whom he was caried for his further terrifying when he was newly hanged in the ſtreat) & that he ſhould be burnt with a hoat iron in the forehead: & by cunning devices; as faire promiſes, and counterfeiting ſundry letters from Maiſter Dorrell to perſwade him to confeſſe. As the boy avouched by word and writing as ſoone as hee gott out of the L. B. of Londons houſe: and ſtoode to it, though afterward the L.B. kept him (being about 14. yeares old) in the counter in South warke 7. weeks togeather, and in baile til the day 
                  defense 2 of hearing. 2. The things which he did or ſuffered in his fits cānot be coūterfeited viz. 1. Such ſwelling that his dublet buttons would breake and the aglet holes of his dublet & breeches, though ſett on and made ſtrong for the purpoſe. 2. Supernaturall ſtrenght ſo as 2. ſtrong men could not hold him down lying on a bed, he being about 12. yeares old. 3. In traunces he vttered cōtinued ſpeaches wth his mouth wide open. 4. In many of his fits his armes & ſhoulder bones were thruſt out of ioynt: yet preſently after the fits he had the vſe of them againe. 5. He was lame, ſo as a ſtrong man was hired to carie him for 12. weeks of 17. vntill he was diſpoſſeſſed, and then

he roſe and walked. 3. Alice Goodridge 
                  defense 3 (a witche) confeſſed the time, cauſe, and manner of his bewitching. For which Iudge Anderſon (after a verdict) gave ſentence vpon her. 4. But ſuppoſe hee counterfeited,
                  defense 4 yet M. Dor. ſimplicitie rather thē impoſture is to be imagined of indifferent men. Sith Darling never did nor would confeſſe, but ever denied that Mr 
               Dorrell did teach him: his being in priſon, and ſo long vnder baile at London, and his often examination notwithſtanding. 5. If hee 
                  defense 5 had confeſſed teaching, it cannot be true: both becauſe the thinges done or ſuffered are not counterfeitable, as alſo becauſe M. Dorr
                  •
                had neuer ſeene him but once, & that with many Preachers at an exerciſe in Burton, vntill the day before hee was diſpoſſeſſed: when M. Dorr. only adviſed the childes friendes to faſt and pray, but was not preſent him ſelfe. 6. Darling was not 
                  defense 6 once placed beſide Sommers, no nor once called to accuſe Dorr. to his face (as Somm. did) or to acknowledge Counterfeitinge, though the ſaid L. B. had long kept him vnder baile and bound him to appeare for that purpoſe, & was alſo preſent there accordingly in the face of the Court. Belike the L.B. knew full well by former and oft

experience, that the boy would deny Mai-Dorrels teaching of him and all counterfeiting. It may bee alſo he feared leaſt the boy would haue diſcouered the foreſaide dealing with him, as alſo tolde that Sōmers was appointed his keeper, and that Harſenet added to his confeſſion that which hee neuer ſpake, whereof he before had accuſed Harſenet: offering either to ſweare him ſelfe, or to reſt with Harſenets oath, but he could not be heard.
            
               
                  allegation 7
               Mary Cooper confeſſeth Counterfeiting.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. The things which ſhe did or ſuffered in her fitts cannot bee counterfeited, viz. Supernaturall 1. ſtrength and 2. knowledge. For among other things ſhe told 2. or 3. dayes before it happened of her huſbands returne, who had long before rūne from her, & had bene but fewe dayes before at Linne, which is from Nottingham (at leaſt) an hundreth miles. 3. Shee was without feeling in her fittes. For her little finger was bēded inward with all the force of a man whereat ſhee then ſtirred not, though preſently after it ſwelled much & (many dayes after) ſhee had great paine. 4. When her fitts ended immediatly began her brother Sommers fitts, and when his ended hers began preſently in the twinckling

of an eye, notwithſtanding they were in ſeverall roomes.
            
               Mary Couper depoſeth that ſhe thinking 
                     allegation 8 her ſelfe with childe, Dorrell would aſſure her that ſhe was not: and ſaid moreouer, God bleſſe euery good woman from ſuch a child. Againe, that ſhee laughing and ſmyling, Dorrell would ſaye that that laughing was from the Diuell; whereas indeed ſhe laughed to heare him talke ſo fooliſhly.
            
            1. Heere is nothing to proove that Mr 
               
                  defense 1 Dorrell taught her to counterfeit. 2. If ſhe 
                  defense 2 had proved with childe the worſt that can be imputed to M. Dorrell, is ſimplicitie. But ſtrange events manifeſting the contrary, & ſufficiently diſcerned by M. Dor. he had reaſon (and the rather being Preacher of the town) to draw her from wilfull perſwaſion of being with childe, to the cō
               ſideration of the work of God by the miniſterie of the Devill, who either inwardly poſſeſſed her (which he rather beleeueth) or being without vexed her by ſome externall operation. As may appeare by theſe ſtrange effectes: firſt Her belly was in the middſt as it were divided, and raiſed vp of either ſide. 2. Out of her belly was heard ſenſibly a kinde of whoopping, and alſo a noyſe much like the whurring of a cat. 3.

Her belly ſuddenly ſwelled as if ſhee had bene halfe gone with childe, and ſo continued with little or no increaſe about a quarter of a yeare. 4. This ſwelling would be ſuddenly gone, & after a while be there againe. 5. Vpon and during this ſwelling ſhe felt ſomething (as it were quicke) ſtirr within her, which from the beginning ſhe ſaid was nothing like the ſtirring ſhee felt when before ſhee was with childe. 6. At laſt ſhee ſeemed to travell 2. or. 3. dayes, & midwife after midwife was ſent for, and many neighbour-women, whereof ſome were of good worſhippe who will teſtifie the rare accidents. 7. In the beginning her belly was of the bignes aforeſaid and ſoft, the next day very bigg and hard as if ſhe had bene with child indeed, and at the point of deliuerance. 8. Sometimes again very big and ſoft, ſometimes very gaunt, and leſſe then any womans ordinarily is. 9. A moving (as of ſome quicke thing (yet no ſubſtance) was ſeene and felt about her ſtomacke: aboue her breaſtes, and in her arme or ſhoulder. 10 She had the paines of a woman in travaile, & in danger of death, ſo as the bell was told for her. 11. There were all the ſignes and forerunners of a child: yea that iſſued from her which never

came from woman, but when a childe was borne 12. Beſides the things in commō with a woman, ſhe had lumps of fleſh came from her: which caried to the Phiſition, he ſaid, If they came from nature ſhe could not live. 13. Yet while theſe things were in doing, and preſently after, ſhe roſe out of her bedde and went vp and downe the houſe, & for all this travaill kept neytheir bed nor houſe. 14. In her breaſt was ſometimes water, ſometimes milke. 15. And after ſuch travaill M. Dorr. and others haue ſeene her belly ſomewhat bigger thē ordinarie, and within halfe a quarter of an hower ſo great, as if ſhee had ben ready to 
                  defense 3 bee delivered of a childe. 3. The reaſons moving M, Dorr. ſo to iudge (as is ſaide) of her laughing, be theſe. 1. Hee perceyved Satans work in and vpon her. 2. He remē
               bred the like countenance of Katharine Wright, and of 3. or 4. of the 7. in Lancaſhire. 3. He cōſidered that ſuch an effect may well come from Satan delighted in all vanitie. 4. Hee hearde that for 4. or 5. weekes of her ſuppoſed going with child, ſhe could not abſtayne (as ſhee then confeſſed) from flearing, when ſhe looked on any. 5. Hee indeavoured (beeing a Preacher vnder whoſe miniſterie ſhee was) to

               
                  defense 4 turn hir eye to God correcting her. 4. The allegation of her laughing at M. Dor. fooliſh talking, is but in vaine: conſidering he reſorted to her ſeldome, and her laughing was many weekes, and in that tyme ſhee laughed full often when he was abſent.
            
               
                  allegation 9
               William Sommers depoſeth Counterfeiting and that Dorrell taught him, which though of it ſelfe it be of ſmall validitie, yet ſith 3. other affirme the like, it is to ſome purpoſe.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. But the accuſation of theſe other three being palpably falſe, this 4. depoſition & the circūſtances to ſupport the ſame be (at leaſt) very much weakened, and accordingly to be regarded. 2. The thinges 
                  defense 2 which he did or ſuffered in his fits, cannot be counterfeited viz. 1. He being gathered round on a heape like a loafe was caſt vp about halfe a yarde high. 2. A ſtrange noiſe was ſenſibly hearde to come out of his belly. 3. Hee often with great force hath beaten his face & head to the groūd, and caſt himſelfe headlong againſt the walls, ſo as one would haue thought hee had ſpoiled or bruiſed himſelfe greatly, yet receaved he no hurt at all. 4. His face was turned directly backward. 5. For ſixe weekes (ofte in a day) his body ſeemed as

big againe as naturally it is, and (once) by ſwelling he brake a new leather girdle.
            6. In this ſwelling his entralles ſhott vp & downe like a weavers ſhittle. 7. Three or 4. men could ſcarſly lifte him. 8. His foming white and thicke roaped downe his breſt ſomtime an hower togyther, though often wiped away. 9. In his fits his temples and pulſes did not beat. 10. He lay for an hower and a halfe as dead, cold as Ice, face and handes blacke, and without breath perceived. 11. His tongue vſully retorted into his throate ſo as no parte of it was to bee ſeene in his mouth. 12. He ſpake diſtinctly in a cōtinued ſpeach for a quarter of an hower his mouth being ſhutt cloſe. 13. His tongue drawen into his throate & his mouth wide open hee ſaid, Ego ſum Deus, ego ſum Rex. 14. He neither tooke any ſuſtenance nor diſburthened nature for 3. dayes. 15, Pinnes were thruſt deepe into ſundry partes of his body. Somtimes vp to the head, yet he felt not, neither did blood iſſue. 16▪ Often caſt, ſometimes hand, ſometimes face in the fire: where he lay a while, yet not burned. 17. Three men did ſtriue with him about an hower till they ſweat and were breathleſſe, yet he did not pant nor drawe winde, perceived: yea

ſometimes 4.5.6. or mo were ſcarſe able to hould him though they had him at great advantage, as lying flatt vpon the ground, or vpon a bed, or tyed faſt to a chaire. 18. He ſaid Dal. Freeman & Higgetts wife were ſtripping & ſearching. Dal: hath a marke vpon ſuch a ſhoulder, and the other in her mouth though vnknowen. Againe they (to witt Iuſtice Perkins, &c:) haue her (to witt Miliſent Horſeley) and are examining her, and ſhe ſaith ſhe doth all by prayer, now they ſtrippe her and ſearch her, and after, nowe ſhe is brought to towne. Againe they (to witt a conſtable, &c.) are there now: She (to witt Milicent Horſleyes ſiſter) ſitteth lapping her ſore toe, ô ſore toe! ſhe cannot goe for her ſore to, now they hale her forth, looke how they pull her out, they call for ropes and a horſe. Looke where ſhe commes running through the meadows, now ſee ſhee is come to towne. Againe now M. Dorrell (then at Aſhby) hath conſented to come, and the next day, now he is come to towne. All theſe things were as he ſaid, at the ſame inſtāt, though far frō him. Again to a traveling ſtranger, O murtherer what doest thou heere? Who acknowledged flying the land for killing a man about 20. yeares before. An other ſtranger hee told

where hee had gone out of the way, that ſuch a thing befell him in ſuch a place, & of a ſecret of his body; the man acknowledged all. Againe 7. weekes before the Aſſizes in a traunce, I must go to S. Johns (a houſe of correction where he was afterwardes had by commaundement of the Maior and Aldermen of Nottingham, againſt the will of his parentes) and being there M. Dorrell must not come at me, (which proved true) and at the Aſſiſes I must be before the Judges, & they must ſee. It came ſo to paſſe indeede, for by commandemente of Iudge Anderſon beeing before him, they ſaw a trifling and deluding fitt, the boy beeing brought to ſay hee counterfeited. Laſtly he expounded the Creed an hower togeather divine-like, ſave that he intermixed an error or two, as of Chriſt his Soules deſcent into Hell, &c. 19. There were felt vnder the coverlet (where he lay) 4. or 5. (as kitlings, or whelpes &c.) ſtirring, & ſometimes round as a boull, which vaniſhed or gave place like aire or winde in a bladder, when ſome would haue held them; the hand removed the boull filled. The coverlett ſudainly caſt vp, they were gone: thrown downe, there againe: the boyes handes and feete

being held. And this cōtinued 10. dayes & nights, in which time he appeached 8. women (of whom they before named were ſome) and 2. men to be witches, one after an other: at the moſt two togeather, and as ſone as hee named one to haue a catt he was never quiet, but was often toſſed and thrown vpon his bed ſtrangly & grevouſly crying out vpon the partie or parties to fetch and bring them, often ſaying: their Cats were in bed with him, continuing ſo till they were had before the Magiſtrate, & brought vnto the boy. Neere whom as they came (but one after an other) while they were in the houſe (though in another roome) or offered to go from him, he was grievouſly and extraordinanrily handled: and yet while the ſuſpected perſon taryed by him, he lay as if he had bene a ſleepe. Beſides which obſervation, there was ſuch triall made, that ſuch as were about him knew as well when any of thē were neere, as if they had bene told. After thoſe tenne perſons had bene with the Magiſtrate and him, he cryed vpon them no more but was quiet. 20 There was in the roome where he lay a ſtrange rapping as vpon wainſcott with a finger, Sommers handes and feete being held immoveable. 21. He had a

ſwelling in ſome places as big as an egge, in ſome places bigger, in ſome leſſe, running ſwiftly betweene the fleſh and the skinne, from legg to legg, from arme to arme, from finger to finger, on the backe of his hande, forehead, eare-roots, and tongue, yea thereby his eyes were thruſt out extraordinarily big and blacke. When it made any ſtay in legg or arme, it made the leg or arme as heavy and inflexible as iron. Which ſwelling may ſeeme to be by the ſpeciall providence of God to ſtop the mouthes of Atheiſtes ſwarming in theſe dayes. For ſundry troubled wth the ſclaunder of counterfeiting ſecretly and earneſt-prayed to God (the knower of hearts) that they might ſee ſome thing that might ſatisfie them. They went to Sommers, & by this ſigne (by Gods providence rather preſented vnto them then other ſignes) were ſatisfied.
            
               Sommers offered to counterfeit this ſwelling 
                     allegation 10 before the high Commiſſioners at Lambeth.
            
            1. In deed hee putt his tongue into his 
                  defense 1 Cheekes. So (belike) he would haue coū
               terfeited the reſt, except hee had had the Divels helpe beyond the L. B. of Lond. his expectation. 2. Before he vtterly denied 
                  defense 2
               
the fact. And that not ſerving the L. B. of Lōdons turne, the L. B. ſaid it was the Cholique. But perceiuing that healing ſo ſtrāg a Cholique by faſting, &c. makes for Mr 
               Dorr: Coūterfeiting in all things ſeemeth to be reſolved vpon as the beſt policie and 
                  defense 3 colour. 3. Thyreus de Daemoniacis, ca. 32 telleth of ſome poſſeſt that had the like 
                  defense 4 ſwelling. 4. Some Popiſh perſons (for the ſame not called into queſtion as M. Dorr. is) chaſed the ſwelling (as they ſpeake) with the ſigne of the Croſſe from head to foote, and from foote to head. Satan therby feeding them in their ſuperſtitious eſtimation 
                  defense 5 of the ſigne. 5. By faſting & prayer it was ſo driven quite away, that it returned not, till Somm. was repoſſeſt, which was 12. weekes after. All theſe things cō
               ſidered, this (with the reſt) came from Satan.
            
               
                  allegation 11
               Sundry of Dorrells witneſſes haue corrected their oathes.
            
            
               
                  defense 
                1. No marvaile though ſome (among many) prove weake; ſpecially beeing drawen by ſuch meanes, viz. Firſt laying before them the confeſſion of Sommers himſelfe and of other: So dealt they with Mai. Beersford. But that not prevayling, then were they threatned with aunſwering before

the L. B. of London at their peril. One was commaunded to appeare the firſt day of the terme following, & another (namely Henry Butler) was commanded to priſon in the ſight of others, Ad terrorem. 2. They doe not denie the trueth of Sommers
               
                  defense 2 poſſeſſion, but extenuate ſome particulars. As for example, Rich. Mee denieth not all ſwelling of Sommers tongue, and eyes, but leſſeneth the bignes. 3. They goe not backe frō other particulars which 
                  defense 3 they haue ſworne, of no leſſe importance then thoſe they extenuate: Nay it may be, if their reexamination were ſeene, they do confirme them. 4 They are but few, and 
                  defense 4 cannot preiudice the reſt, eſpecially ſeeing many ſcores are ready (for all the L. B. of London his ſtorming) to depoſe all that, and more then is yet depoſed.
            
               Some doe depoſe, that indevouring to try 
                     allegation 12 the matter of Kitlings, & ſuddenly putting their handes into Sommers bed, one at one tyme caught his hande or foote, another his privie partes; Another ſweareth that he deſiring to haue throwen off the Couerlett to 
                     •
                  aue ſeene what it was, Mai. Dorrell for
                  
                     •
                  ad, ſaying, that Sommers ſweating, it was 
                     •
                  nough to cost him his life.
            
            
               
               
                  defense 1 1. The Affirmatiue is directly ſworne by ſundry witneſſes who are not to bee periured, becauſe theſe men failed; for there might bee ſuch thinges at other times, 
                  defense 2 though not then whē they tryed. 2. They ſweare not that they made ſuch tryall within thoſe tenne dayes, So that it might be afterward when Somm. pretended coū
               terfeiting: If they did, it were to no purpoſe except they ſweare that within that time, many ſuch tryalls were made, & yet that were to no great purpoſe for the former 
                  defense 3 reaſon. 3. It could not be his handes or feete, for his armes and feet were held, and there were 4. or 5. ſuppoſed Kitlinges: nor his privie partes (a ridiculous matter) for the Kitlings ſtirred a pretty ſpace from his body. 4. As for Mr 
               Dorrels forbidding 
                  defense 4 to vncover Somm. for the pretended daunger, it is both falſe, (for Sommers did never ſweat in any of his fittes) and abſurde, for Sommers lay in his clothes with a light coverlett onely vpon him. But he that often counterfeiteth laughing, muſt ſometimes ſtraine him ſelfe.
            
               
                  allegation 13
               Thomas Garland depoſeth that Sommers was ſometymes of an ordinarie ſtrength.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. This letteth not but that ſometimes he was of an extraordinarie ſtrength.
            
               2. It is not ſaid that he had alwayes ſupernaturall 
                  defense 2 ſtrength, no not in his fitts, wherin ſome ſupernaturall or ſtraunge workes were ſeene in one fit, ſome in another, ſeldome all in one.
            
               Sommers was cast with his ſhoulder towards 
                     allegation 14 the fyer, where was a grate, & ſo taken quickly away.
            
            1. This may be at one time, and yet he 
                  defense 1 might be ſo caſt (as is depoſed by ſundry, yea by the foreſaide Thomas Garland before the L. B. of Lōdon) that his bare hand lay in the fire. At another time hee was throwne ſo as his face did beare downe hoat coales; lying thus Mary Cowper ſnatcht at him; caught his lynnen cap; but left his bare face and head in the fyer, and yet neither face burned, nor heare ſinged.
            
               Sommers had blacke lead in his mouth,
                     allegation 15 and therefore he fomed, and betweene his teeth, wherewith he ſeemed to gnaſh.
            
            1. Blacke lead cannot cauſe foming, eſpecially 
                  defense 1 roping for an hower togeather,
                  defense 2 as is ſaid and proved. 2 The blacke lead was found but once, & that ſundry weeks after his diſpoſſeſſion, whē he was perſwaded to be a conterfeit. 3 Blacke lead may 
                  defense 3 cauſe craſhing when he was a counterfeit, but not that gnaſhing, which was ſundry

weekes before: at what time hee was no 
                  defense 4 counterfet. 4. They that depoſe gnaſhing were blind, if they could not ſee blacke lead betweene his white teeth.
            
               
                  allegation 16
               Sommers depoſeth that Dorrell taught him to counterfeit.
            
            
               
                  defense 1 1. It is proved that nothing was counterfeit, 
                  defense 2
               Ergo no teaching. 2. Sommers is but one witnes, therefore not ſufficient, eſpecially againſt a Miniſter, 1. Timot. 5.19. 
                  defense 3 3. The affirmatiue oath of a man of good birth, educatiō, yeares & lyfe, much more of a Miniſter, ſhould make light the oath of a lewd boy, eſpecially with ſuch as are accompted Guardians of the ſpiritualtie: as they are called 13. Elizabeth. cap. 12. 
                  defense 4 4. Sommers is an vnlawful witnes, beeing manifeſtlie guiltie of periurie (having by oath both denied and affirmed counterfeiting) as alſo of blaſphemy: (if hee were a 
                  defense 5 counterfeit) For hee ſaid, he was God and Chriſt. 5. Sommers coūterfeited (to ſpeak as the L. B. of London would have it) a moneth or 6▪ weekes, before M. Dorr. ever ſaw him.
            
               
                  allegation 17
               Sommers depoſeth that long before Dorrell came to Nottingham, they mett at Aſhby de la Zouche, where Dorrell then dwelled, and (vpō agreement) they mett at Aſhby

parke 4. yeares together, euery time Sommers comming 4. miles, to witt from Ma. Gray (with whom he then dwelled) his houſe at Gray Langley in Leicester-ſhire: Jn which Parke and time Dorrell taught and Sommers learned to counterfeit, and after by Dorrels direction, Sommers ſhewed him ſelf at Nottingham. Alſo before Sommers went to dwell with one Ma. Brackenbery, (where he began to coūterfeit) Dorr. taught him, but Sommers having not well learned his feates, gaue over till Dorrell had taught him better. Lastly, Dorr. comming to Nottingham (5o 
               No. 97.) acted before Sommers the ſignes of poſſeſſion and dispoſseſſion, giving him direction (and that two dayes together) immediatly before the ſuppoſed diſpoſſeſſion.
            
            1. Either there needes not ſo much teaching,
                  defense 1 or the like tale ſhould haue bene framed of the other 3. counterfeits ſo called, ſith they are all ſaide to haue played the ſame feates, and that therfore M. Dor. taught them, becauſe they were handled all alike. 2. To one Sommers ſaid, that the 
                  defense 2 ſommer before his diſpoſſeſſion, M. Dorr. perceyving a ſwelling in Sōm. body got by often going into the water, came to him at Nottingham, and bad him conceale it, &

ſo they firſt agreed vpon counterfeiting▪ To an other, that they came firſt acquainted when M. Dorrell dealt with Katherine Wright, which is aboue 13. yeares agoe, when Sommers was ſcarſe 9. yeares olde. And touching the manner of their firſt meeting at Aſhby depoſed: One tyme Sō
                  mers tels the L. B. of London that he came to M. Dorrell and two ſtrangers talking in the ſtreet, and demanded whereof they were talking: M. Dorrell anſwered of one Katharine Wright ſometimes poſſeſt, the ſtrāgers departed, they went into the fields &c. Another time he telles the L. B. that M. Dorr. firſt mett him in an alehouſe among other boyes; had ſpeach with him apart, and ſo they firſt agreed vpon counterfeiting. 
                  defense 3 3. About tenne yeares agoe, (which is 4. or 5. yeares before the ſaide pretended meeting) Sommers then about 10. yeares old (went from M. Gray to M. Brackenbury in Warwickshire: And it is not 7. yeres ſince Dorrel came frō 
               Manſfield to Aſhby. For moſt part of whiche time, Sommers being gone from M. Brackenbury, and never returning to M. Gray, dwelt in Nottingham and was ſervant (for 4. yeares before his diſpoſſeſſiō) with Tho. 
                     defense 4 Potter. 4. If Mai. Dorrell acted ſignes of

poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſion two mornings togeather, without doubt ſome may depoſe the ſame with Sommers, conſidering Somm. was never without companie night or day. 5. M. Dorr. can proue that thoſe whole mornings he was elſwhere far from Sommers.
            
               Though the boyes testimony alone be not 
                     allegation 18 good, yet it is fortified by ſundry circumſtances hereafter ſet downe.
            
            1. Circumſtances be but halfe a profe 
                  defense 1 in the civill lawe, and that in a caſe where one ſufficient witneſſe ſpeakes fully to the matter. Now Sōmers is no ſufficient witnes: therefore theſe circumſtances are no ſufficient proofe. 2. Beſides that which is 
                  defense 2 ſaid before of the commiſſioners their bad dealing with deponents, it may now be further excepted againſt them that they are Mr Dorrells mortall enemies, and were choſen by his adverſaries, without his conſent or knowledge, one of themſelues being their Clerke. 3. If notwithſtanding all 
                  defense 3 allegations to the contrary it bee evident, that nothing was counterfeit, but that many things were impoſſible to be counterfeited, then a thouſand ſuch preſumptions doe but dazle mens eyes, & conclude not M. Dor. to teach Sommers to counterfet,

But even probably to conclude the thing preſumed, theſe Circumſtances ſhould be (as divers, ſo) very ſtrong. Which (indeede) heere are very weake and in no probabilitie, doe conclude the thing preſumed, to witt, that M. Dorrell taught Sommers to counterfet. As for example, the 13. & 14. Circumſtances (two of the ſtrongeſt) doe

thus conclude. M. Dorrell bought out Sommers his yeares of apprentiſhip, and Sommers reſorted to M. Dorrels chamber where they had private talke. Therefore it is likely M. Dorrell taught Sommers to counterfet. Indeed if redemption and talke had bene before diſpoſſeſſion, theſe preſumptions had ben ſomwhat probable, it being graunted that all Sommers his ſuppoſed feates could be poſſibly counterfeited.

B. of London would needs be at charges in ſending downe his Commiſſioners. 2. Harſenet (his chaplaine) was by his appointment (as keeper and examiner of Darling, ſo) a principall Cōmiſſioner, whoſe partiallity in executing his commiſſion, may be preſumed by his impudency before the high Cōmiſſionerson whitſoneve. Both (touched heereafter) preſume concurrence with his maiſter. 3. When deponentes would ſpeake to the iuſtifying of M. Dorr: Harſenett threatned them, not with the high Commiſſion ſo much, as with the L. B. of London. 4. The L. B▪ of London not abiding any thing that makes for M. Dorrell (according to that of Chriſt He that evill doeth, hateth the light.) Hideth & hindreth all evidences, checketh or threatneth all witneſſes for M. Dorr: Namely M. Ireton (a famous learned miniſter) M. Gray, and Bambridge worſhipfull gentlemen. 5. By his ſole warrant the L. B. of London tooke from M. Dorrel certeine directions in law cōcerning this cauſe only, which M. Dorr.

(being denied councell to plead for him) was conſtreined to procure. 6. Often did the L. B. of Lond. examine (as Darling the boy of Burton) ſo M. Dorrell (at onetime with an other) vpon 180. interrogatories or thereabout. 7. The regiſter would haue graunted M. Dorr. wife copies of his anſwers, &c. but onely the L. B. of London would not. 8. On Whitſon eve the L. B. of Lond. had a booke of depoſitions, & pleaded as earneſtlie as Doct. Crūpton the appointed advocate, to whom ſtanding at his elbow the L.

Sommers (made for the purpoſe) was appointed Darlings keeper when he was cloſe priſoner in the L. B. houſe, and then dealt with Darling to doe as he had don. 5. Sōmers robbing of Harſenett was ſmothered. 6. Though Darling

Moſt of the afternoone (on Whitſoneve) was ſpent in pleading and pretended proving againſt Mai. Dorrell. 3. M. Dorr. beginning to ſpeak

at large to all matters obiected againſt him, was by the L. B. of Cant. forbidden, and for this reaſon, leaſt M. Dorrel ſhould perſwade his favourites there preſent. 4. M. Dorrell deſired a cōdition to examine witneſſes for his parte, or that depoſitions already taken, and by him then preſented, might be heard. But the L. B. of Cant. denied both. 5. M. Dorrell did charge Harſenet and his fellowe Commiſſioners with threatning of witneſſes, taking mony, &c. Harſenet openly anſwered that M. Dor. durſt aſwel eate a toades head as name particulars, M. Dorrell did name particulars; wherevpon was ſome ſilence. But excuſe was readily coyned, and as eaſily taken. 6. M. Dorrell perceyuing the L. Biſho. their courſe, appealed to the L. chief Iuſtice of England; earneſtly deſiring his Lordſh. to vouchſafe hearing ſome few particulars as poſſible for Sommers to counterfeit, as to fly. Audience was graunted. Among the reſt he tolde, that Sōmers ſpake his mouth gaping and tongue retorted. He deſcribed the running ſwelling, and ſhewed how he was dead an hower, &c. The Iudge acknowledged them very wonderful. It was aunſwered, That the retorting was by meanes of a ſtring, and that the boy could

counterfeit ſwelling, which the Iudge deſiring to ſee, Sommers rowled his tōgue in his mouth. To the third nothing was ſaid. 7. Yet for all this that iuſt Iudge (who in his owne Court admitteth no coppies of depoſitions without an oath that they are true copies, much leſſe boūd vp in books, & ſuffereth the accuſed to pleade & prove aſwell as the accuſer, (yea in a former hearing told Mr Dorrell that he was to prove) tooke now occaſion to ſignifie great diſliking of Mai. Dorrell, becauſe he ſaide hee thought Sommers to be yet poſſeſſed. The like occaſion or leſſe, tooke Doctor Caeſar to ſignifie ſemblant miſlike (though vpon reading M. Dorr. Apologie and the ſtorie of the 7. in Lancaſhire) he had pronoūced M. Dorrels cauſe to be Gods cauſe. 8. Notwithſtanding ſo great proofe pretended of ſo hainous a matter obiected: As of abuſing 1. the name of Ieſus: 2. the exerciſes of preaching, prayer and faſting, and hundreds of Gods people, by ſo many couſenages and counterfeitings as he was charged with: yet Mai. Dorrell (the pretended offendor) hath no more puniſhment, then M. Moore for only iuſtifying his cauſe. Amongſt the reſt perpetuall impriſonmēt was threatned. For the L. B. of Londō had

ſaid he ſhould not out of priſon while hee were B. of London. Theſe thinges well weighed, it is likely that the Cōmiſſionars being wiſe men and able to diſcerne colours, had ſuch regard (in pollicy) of the L. B. of Londons authority, that they hearkened to whatſoever tended to M. Dorr. blame, and neglected the contrary: leaſt (otherwiſe) the L. B. of Londō ſo indirectly and egerly following, yet altogeather fayling in ſo great a matter, ſhould reape no little ſhame. Though theſe generall anſwers bee ſufficient, yet more to ſatisfie all men, M. Dorrell anſwereth thus particularly.
            
               Dorrell ſaid vpon the bare receipt of a 
                     circumstance 1 lettre from a woman, that Somers was poſſeſſed hefore he ſaw him.
            
            The letter (indeed) was ſubſcribed only by M. Dorrels wifes ſiſter,Anſwere. but written in the name of manie of Nottingham, and conteyning ſome ſignes of poſſeſſion. The meſſinger (converſant with Sōmers) made the caſe more plaine: whervpon M. Dorr. (though he had then never ſeene Sōmers, yet) crediting Gods word which recordeth like ſignes, anſwered that if Sommers was handled as is reported, no doubt he was poſſeſſed.
            
               
               
                  circumstance 2
               Dorrell was told at his first comming to Nottingham, that Sommers did counterfett: he notwithstanding gaue out the contrarie.
            
            
               Anſwer.It is true that the next day after he came to Nottingham and had ſeene Sommers fitts, M. Dorrell ſaid to ſome ſuſpecting counterfetting, that it could not be poſſibly. This may preſume hundreths to haue taught Sommers, and others, to counterfeit: as well as M. Dorrell.

               Anſwer.
               M. Dorrell never ſawe the like before, neither was he the interpreter. Indeed no one man eſpecially, but many confuſedly did interpret the dumb ſhew. So that (once) in open Court, the L. B. of London charged Miſtris Gray therewith. But admit that M. Dorrell did interpret, it preſumeth forwardnes to ſpeak, not teaching to counterfeit, and the rather ſith by no arte the like can be counterfeited.

            M. Dorrell indeede was ſuerty,Anſwer. (and paid 13 ſ. 4 d.) for Sommers Father in law, who agreed (6 weekes after the diſpoſſeſſion) with Sommers maiſter (being a fidler)

for his yeers. Towards paymēt whereof M. Maior of Nottingham collected, &c. For the deed and cauſe was openly knowen, & approved. This preſumeth not teaching more in M. Dorrell then in the Maior, but that M. Dorr. had a godly care that Sommers ſhould not any longer prophane the Sabbath, but ſerve the Lorde IESVS in whoſe name he was delivered.
            
               
                  circumstance 14
               Sommers came oft to Dorrells chamber, and had private talke.
            
            
               Anſwer.About 8. weekes after the diſpoſſeſſion, there was once or twice ſuch talke. The cauſe was, Sommers Father and other perceiving ſome miſdemeanour, deſired M. Dorrell to talke with him hoping that Sommers would regard M. Dorrell then preacher of Nottingham, and the rather becauſe of his deliverance. This preſumeth teaching no more by M. Dorr: then by others, who had oftener private talke with him, who by croſſing (as is ſaid) had chaſed the ſwelling, had charged the ſpirit in the name of Ieſus to goe out, affirmed Sommers to be poſſeſſed, and interpreted the dumb ſhew: Indeed if it had ben depoſed either that this talke had ben before diſpoſſeſſiō it had ben ſome thing, or that M. Dorrell was heard commending

of Sommers for his acting or counterfeting, it had ben more then a preſumption.
            
               Dorrell ſent Sommers to ſee Darlings fits 
                     circumstance 15 in Burton, that ſo he might be more expert.
            
            Indeed Sommers avouched as much to Darlings face in the hearing of many in the L. B. of Londons houſe.Anſwer. But Darling asking him, whether the bridge into Burton were long or ſhort, or whether his vncles houſe were of wood or ſtone, and 3. in what end of the town builded? Somm. anſwered, 1. that the bridge was ſhort. 2. That Darli. vncles houſe was a ſorry one of wood: and 3. ſtāding at ſuch an ende of the towne. Looke (ſaid Darling) what a notable lyar he is. For the Bridge hath ſo many Arches, and is a quarter of a myle long: my Vncles houſe built of ſtone, is one of the faireſt, & ſtandeth in the midſt of the towne. Beſides, Sōmers was all the time of Darlings poſſeſſion with his Maiſter Potter at Nottingham, 20. myles from Burton. 4. Let this be proved, ſo as Dorrell having commiſſion can not diſproove it, and he will yeeld.

                     objection 1 If thoſe 4. were counterfeites, they can do the ſame things againe, & in ſuch ſort, as many depoſed that they haue done thē: If not, (the things being ſupernaturall) it muſt needs be, that they were done by the Divell.

                  Tumblers by diſcontinuance cannot act their trickes as before.
               
               
                  
                     reply 1 1. Tumbling trickes are performed by nimblenes. The ſignes or effectes of poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſion can not be ſo performed. 
                     reply 2 2. Sommers avouched before the high Cōmiſſioners (on Whitſon-eve) that he could doe them againe as ſtraungely as ever: whervpon roome was made. But the L. B. of London was vnwilling that more tryall ſhould bee made, then hee thought convenient. For if Sommers had gone on, he would either haue ſhamed all, by coū
                  terfeiting the reſt, as hee did the running ſwelling, by rolling his tongue. Or if hee had acted all the fearfull thinges, that are depoſed, the L.B. of Lond. him ſelf would thinke that Sommers ſaid true, when hee cōfeſſed; That the Devill perſwading him to ſay that hee counterfeited, promiſed to helpe him to doe the ſame.

                  Darling (ſcarſe 13. yeares olde) did counterfeit to that end, it is likely that other of the coūterfeits (being elder) had the ſame ende; ſith M. Dorrell (a Miniſter) is ſaid to

was poſſeſſed 17. weekes before Faſting & prayer, or M. Dorr. (a meere ſtranger dwelling in an other Country) was thought of, or his vexacion (knowne to bee by witchcrafte) was perceived to bee poſſeſſion. 6.
                     reply 6 Laſtlie, neither Mr Dorr. nor any Miniſter was preſent at his diſpoſſeſſion:
               Howſoever the L. B. of London hath 
                     objection 5 ſhewed him ſelfe in this caſe Domine fac totum amōg the high Commiſſioners, yet ſith other Commiſſioners muſt needes ioyne with him in many thinges, for warranting the ſame, Mai. Dorr. humbly craveth favour; that having ſufficient cauſes and reaſons, he may (without preiudice to the high commiſſion it ſelf, which he honoureth as a moſt lawfull authoritie) chalenge the equitie and lawfulnes of the L. B. of London, and ſome of the Commiſſioners (his partakers) their proceedings in this cauſe. For though this pretended coū
                  terfeiting  were thoroughly examined, and evidently proved by moſt ſufficient Commiſſioners to haue ben no counterfeiting, ſo as the L. Archbiſhop of Yorke was perſwaded of vndoubted poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſion, And yet moved by the letters of ſome great perſonages (it may be the Bb. of Cant. and London) he ſuſpended Mai.

Dorr. (whom he acknowledged to bee an honeſt man) from the executiō of his Miniſterie to the impoveriſhing of him, his wyfe, and 5. poore children, and to the diſcouraging of all thoſe, who by his miniſterie (affected becauſe of Somm. his diſpoſſeſſion) began to taſt of the Goſpell in Nottingham, where a ſetled Preacher had not bene ſince her Maieſties raigne. And that only becauſe hee holdeth faſting and prayer bee meanes left by Chriſte in his Church to caſt Devils out of the poſſeſſed: yet ſo, that therein he referreth his opiniō to the cenſure of his learned & godly brethren. Notwithſtanding (I ſay) the cleere manifeſtation of poſſeſſion and diſpoſſeſſion (againſt which no exception hath bene  or can be laid) yet further he cōplayneth, that by warrant from the high Commiſſion of Canterbury Province, he was ſent for, and preſently committed to the Gate-houſe for the ſuppoſed hereſie, where hee hath lyen a yeare and certen monethes, & ſtill lyeth without any iudiciall & lawfull tryall, (notwithſtandinge ſufficient bayle was often & humbly offered) yea ſo hardly vſed, that (by no entreatie) hee can obteyne liberty to goe abroade with his keeper, (as other priſoners doe) no not to goe

to Church vpō the Sabbath day. In which proceedings Dorrell ſuppoſeth ſmall regard to be had firſt of 28. H. 8. cap. 9. where an Archb: is reſtrayned from drawing a cauſe of haereſy to his own hearing, from any B. or ordinary within his province, except the ſaid B. or ordinarie conſent or do not his duty in puniſhment of the ſame. Much leſſe may M. Dorrell his cauſe bee drawne out of another Province from an Archb. and that after puniſhmēt inflicted, except high Commiſſioners of Cant. may execute a tranſcendent authority. Secondly as of this ground of lawe, Nemo bis pro eodem delicto puniendus est, ſo of 1. Eliza. cap. 2. where it is provided that a Miniſter depraving the booke of common prayer, &c. ſhall not be puniſhed both by the B. and Iudge. Much leſſe (thinketh M. Dor.) is ſuppoſed (not convicted) hereſie to bee puniſhed twice in Eccleſiaſticall Courtes. Thirdly, of 1. Eliz. ca. 1. where it is expreſlie provided, That nothing is to be iudged hereſy, which hath not bene ſo iudged by authoritie 1. of the Canonicall Scripturs. 2. of any of the 4. firſt generall Councills, or of the Parliament, &c. But affirming faſting & prayer to be meanes, &c. hath not bene ſo adiudged. Ergo. Fourthly, of magna

Charta, the violaters wherof are ſolemly accurſed An̄. 12. H. 3. where (cap. 29.) The Prince thus proteſteth, No Free-man may be taken or impriſoned, &c. we will not goe vpon him, &c. but by lawfull iudgement of his Peeres, or by the law of this land. To none will we denie or deferr Juſtice or right. If not the Prince, much leſſe may Cōmiſſioners violate this Charter. And of West. 1. cap. 15. where it is ſaid; If any with holde priſoners repleviſable after they offred ſufficient ſurety, he ſhall pay a grievous amerciament vnto the King. But baile is not denyed M. Dorr. by any lawe, for any thinge yet laid to his charge. Ergo.
               
                  
                     
                        •
                     tionFor all this ſuſpending, and impriſoning M. Dorr. for his ſuppoſed haereſie, yet whē Sommers was drawen to accuſe M. Dorrel of teaching him to counterfett, the L. Bb. followed that ſent with a full cry with examination vpon examination (M. Dorrell himſelfe being examined at ſeveral times, vpon (about) 180. articles) with commiſſion vpon commiſſion; M. Dorrell often deſired to ioyne in commiſſion, to haue copies of depoſitions, and to haue a new commiſſion to examine witneſſes on his parre, but was denyed all: witneſſes (grave Preachers, and worthy Gentlemen) ſpeaking

for M. Dorrel were reproved, and depoſitions materiall to his iuſtification (taken by other Commiſſioners) were twice ſnatched from him in open Court, ſome would not be receaved at all, yea ſome were blotted out beeing recorded by the Regiſter. Nay theſe hunters for matter againſt M. Dorr. could ſo hardly abide anie thing that ſounded towardes the ſignification of his innocency, that a poore pariſh-Clerke was fetched vp from Nottingham, onely becauſe he did ſing the 94. Pſalme before that the Nottingham Commiſſioners (forſooth) ſatt in Commiſſion. Which proceedings M. Dorrell hopeth all indifferent men will deeme, as very indirect, ſo of ſmall validitie. For theſe conſiderations: Firſt, M. Dorr. was cōmitted for one thing, and proſecuted for another. Secondly, the iudging of counterfeiting belongeth (as M. Dorr. ſuppoſeth) to the Starr chamber, or ſome other of her Maieſties Courts, and not to the high Commiſſion. Thirdly, in that lawe (whereby the high Commiſſion reigneth) it is a rule, Delegatus non potest delegare. And fourthlie, In the Stare chā
                  ber (where moſt criminall cauſes be heard & determined) the party accuſed (of what fault ſoever) hath leave to plead and prove

for him ſelfe, and to take out copies of depoſitions for him or againſt him.
               
                  
                     objection 7 If there had bene a ſincere purpoſe to finde out the trueth, it is ſtraunge that the ſame Commiſſioners ſhould bee ſtill imployed in diſcovering theſe 4. coūterfets: as Darling by Harſenett, Kather. Wright by Harſenett, Pigott, and Gregory. Indeed the Maior of Cheſterfielde (for countenāce ſake) was one with them, who (ſimpleman) was content to ſett his hand to what they had don, though hee was not at the doing him ſelfe. Mary Cowper by thoſe 3. and other of Nottingham for the purpoſe, as hereafter, &c. And Williā Somm. by the ſame. And it is more ſtraunge, that ſo many of all ſortes, wiſe, ſimple, godlie, prophane, learned, vnlearned, who viewed thoſe 4. manie times in their fitts (ſith they were long vexed, one 10. weekes, another 17. weekes, a third halfe a yeare, and the 4th. aboue 12. yeares) could not perceive counterfeiting, and theſe finde it out ſo quickly, and yet none of them ever ſaw any of the poſſeſſed in their fitts, nay the Nottingham men could not be drawen to come to that ſight fearing (belike) in their hearts that, which with their mouths they ſaid to haue ben counterfett. Were all other

eye witneſſes fooles and could not, or partiall and would not diſcover? Doubtles if theſe Commiſſioners had gon into Lancaſhire they had founde the 7. poſſeſſed there, to have bene counterfets too.
               
                  Theſe were enioyned by authority to bend their witts to find counterfeiting;
                  Anſwer. 
                  and there is no cauſe why theſe ſhould be partiall.
               
               Yes, two cauſes, Firſt partiall affection.Reply. For Harſenet and Pigott (ſervants of truſt to the L.B. of London ſet againſt M. Dorr. as is ſhewed) were to make good their Maſters word, that ſith he had taken M. Dorrells matter in hande, hee would have the credit of it. And the men of Nottingham muſt iuſtifie their accuſation of Sommers, and wreck their malice vpon M. Dorrell, ſith they had power in their handes by their commiſſion. Secondly Popery: for (not long ſince) Harſenet held about 12. groſſe errors of Popery never yet ſoundly recanted. For which Cambridge ſpewed him out, and now lately denyed him the grace of Doctorſhip. M. Morrey of Nottingham is generally reputed to be a Papiſt, and either for his owne or his wyves popery hath ben before the high Cōmiſſion at Yorke: and M. Gregory hath not receaved the Communion for 11. yeares

togeather. No merveile though the ſecret friends of Rome doe what they can that the true Church of Chriſt may not haue credit by caſting out Devills, which that Synagogue glorieth in as proper to it ſelf. So that ſom Papiſts not denying the poſſeſſiō of the 7. in Lanc. do ſay, That if it were plaine that they were diſpoſſeſſed by the faſting and prayer of M. Dorrell and M. Moore, &c. they will forſake the Church of Rome: wherein they ſhew more ſincerity (though leſſe pollicy) then the L. B. of London and his Commiſſioners. Againe others (Iohn Therold

They ſpent all, or moſt of the afternoone, in reading, conferring, and cavelling vpon peeces of depoſitions (read out of the ſaid bookes) againſt M. Dorrel. Whereas it had bene convenient to haue reade the depoſitions at large, conſidering M. Dorr. had no copies of them, that it might appeare whether the witneſſes (which are drawen to ſpeake ſomewhat in in ſhew againſt M. Dorrell) haue not ſpoken more in ſubſtance for him: as Thomas Garland did: as alſo M. Gray and his wife, M. George Smale, Thomas Porter, and M. Ireton, M. Browne, and M. Evington, 3. learned and godly Preachers: who ſpake materially in the behalfe of M. Dorrell, if it would haue pleaſed the L.B. of London to haue produced their depoſitions at large and vncorrupted. The L. B. of London ſtill promiſed, That when all was ſaid that could bee, M. Dorrell ſhould haue time enough to anſwere at large to every particular, as he oft deſired. But when it came to the point he was cut of from ſpeaking: So that he ſaid nothing to any of the Circumſtances

concerning confederacy with Sommers, or of teaching the other 3. and yet was condemned for teaching all 4. to counterfeit. Neither would they reade any worde of any of the 17. depoſitions that were taken by commiſſion from Yorke: a copie wherof he eftſoones preſented vnto thē. Notwithſtanding alſo they had twice before (in open Court) taken the like from him. Which proceedings M. Dorrell iudgeth to bee againſt theſe rules of Gods worde,

Dorrel a copie thereof, or of the act of that dayes determination, whereof (belike) hee is aſhamed. For they punniſhed M. Moore only for his opinion that heere was no counterfetting, and that

as grievouſly as M. Dorrel, for teaching (as they ſay (eleven to counterfeit, depriving both of their Miniſtery & cōmitting both to cloſe impriſonment, vntill further puniſhment were determined. And thats not yet perpetuall impriſonment, though this alſo hath bene often threatned. But not one of ſo many ſuppoſed counterfers is towards any puniſhment, no not Sommers who is guilty of blaſphemy, if he did coū

As for the Popiſh exorciſts in Lancaſhire (which play their pageant with Iane Aſhton) and thoſe in Nottingham who chaced (as they affirme) the Divell in Sommers with the ſigne of the Croſſe. None of theſe are once called into queſtion. In which proceedings M. Dorrell obſerveth. 1. Firſt matter of Iuſtifying him ſelfe, as thus: Cloſe impriſonment (a ſtrange puniſhment after a cauſe publikly & largely debated on the plaintifs ſide) argueth a feare, that Maiſter Dorrell would iuſtifie himſelfe to ſo many as would (if permitted) reſort to him, whiche preſumptiō is ſo much the more pregnant, becauſe Maiſter Moore was likewiſe committed to cloſe impriſonmēt only for holding a good opinion of M. Dorr.

dealing in diſpoſſeſſion, and becauſe the Archb. ſaid, If they were abroade they would infect the common wealth. Which feare they conceive not of Popiſh Prieſts, whoſe opinions be more dangerous then that of M. Moore: neither neede they to conceive feare of M. Dorrell, if he had ben manifeſtly detected, for then every one would be aſhamed of him. Againe, if M. Dorr. were manifeſtly convicted, of teaching eleaven to counterfet, without doubt, ſome ſhamefull and publike puniſhment would be ſone inflicted for an example to other, without taking ſo long time for determination, and not onely perpetuall impriſontment would bee threatned, leaſt thereby they ſhould ſeeme Murtherers of the perſons, and ſmootherers of the cauſe. Moreover, If the Commiſſioners did not ſecretly thinke counterfeiting to be but a pretended matter, ſome of thē would haue vrged that (as heretofore Miſtres Pinder, and Miſtres Brigges their daughters were compelled to confeſſe ſuch counterfeiting at Paules croſſe, ſo) ſome of ſo many coū

                     terfeiters had bene puniſhed, yet it followeth not that the Bb. had any grudge againſt M. Dorr. & M. Moore that might be probably ſuppoſed, to be the roote of their partialitie.

                     eply.If Darl. were puniſhed for coūterfeiting, then the verdit of 12. men and ſentence of Iudge Anderſon (whereby a witch was cō
                  demned for tormēting Darling by her familiar) are called into queſtiō to the preiudice of her Mats Court, & contrary to the ſtatu. of 27. Ed. 3. ca. 1.2. But indeed Darl. was not impriſoned for coūterfeiting, but for not cōfeſſing coūterfeiting, & denying it after ſuch confeſſion was drawne from him. As may appeare by that is aforeſhewed; by the not puniſhing of Sōm. & by not calling Darl. (at the laſt day of hearing)

to anſwer the diſclaiming his cōfeſſiō, but preſently after they releaſed him & his vncle of his band. 3 The L. Bb. rigorous dealing with M. Dorr. & M. Moore doth of neceſſitie argue either zeale againſt the horrible ſin of coūterfeiting poſſeſſiō, or grudg againſt the perſons. The former it is not, for thē (without dout) they would not only diligently ſeek out the ſin, but puniſh it alſo ſeverely whereſoever they finde it, at leaſt, in ſome of ſo many coūterfeits diſcovered about the ſame time. But ſo they do not; Therefore it followeth, there is ſome grudg againſt M. Dor. & M. Moore though the cauſe be not readily perceyved. 4. But indeed ſundry cauſes may be perceived of all not willingly blinde. 1. The hatred wch the L. Bb. (Cant. & London) haue againſt thoſe that deſire reform. of the church (among whō they accompt M. Dor. and M. Moore) whom they perſecute more egerly then Papiſts, as if they were more ielous of their own miter thē of the Queens crown. Which their Articles in viſitatiōs, & other their proceedings do more then manifeſt. Yea they ſo loth ſuch profeſſors, that they cannot brook faſting & prayer, as they vſe it, without ſome taſt of the leaven of the Phariſees. 2. They would gladly haue this

matter for a complement of that ſclaūderous and ſchiſmaticall booke of Scottizing Genevating Diſcipline, that (through M. Dorrell ſides) they might goare all reformed Churches about vs, and all deſirers of reformatiō amongſt vs. In this ſort, Theſe Diſciplinarians not prevayling by the conſpiracy of Hacket, nor by the libelling of Martin, nor threatning with Vdall, (yet fearing to attempt the rebellion of Scotland and Geneva for their reformation) would obteyne credit by working miracles in casting out Devills. To which purpoſe the L. B. of London and his Advocat, have confidentdently and openly (but moſt falſly) ſpokē. Laſtly, they muſt needes iuſtifie the L. B. of Londons wordes; who (as is ſaid) vaunted that ſith he had taken M. Dorr. cauſe in hand, he would haue the credit of it.
               But all the premiſſes wel conſidered, M. Dorr. appealeth to God, the church, & the Queene to iudge: whether he be iuſtly puniſhed for teaching to coūterfeit poſſeſſiō &c. or the L. Bb. of Cant. & Lond. (overrulers of this caſe) haue not heerein ſhewed themſelves the adverſaries of Ieſus. Sith to the glory of his Name at the faſting and prayer of his people, vncleane Spirits haue ben caſt out by the finger of God.
            
         
         
            
            To the Christian and indifferent Reader.
            THE Report before promiſed (for ſome cauſes not ſent with this treatiſe to the preſſe) was omitted ſo long, as that (in meane while) the booke against M. Dorrell begottē (as for ſom reaſons it may ſeeme) by one, to wit th'authour of Scottizing Genevating diſcipline, is come foorth in deede; but fathered (as a bastard) vpon another, viz. S. H. Whereof I thought good to take knowledge, and to referre ſome fewe things to thy Christian conſideration.
            First concerning the Publiſhing thereof, Jt is to be obſerved, that as copies of Depoſitions were denied before hearing, and M. Dorrell not ſuffred to anſwer (as he ſhould) at hearing, So he is traduced in print after hearing, though he be yet in ſure holde, and therefore without conuenient meanes to reply in ſuch ſort, as this caſe requireth. Is not this to binde a man, and then to fight with him? Hath not the publiſher of M. Dorrels apologie ſome reaſon to call ſuch courſes exorbitant?
            
            
               Secondly, concerning the Matter: It is to be conſidered, That howſoeuer the Diſcouerie of M. Dorrels practiſes in teaching ſundry to counterfeit poſſeſſion, be only pretended; yet D. Barlowes opinion That in theſe dayes there is no poſſeſſion must needes be heere and there maintayned, and yet not directly. J call it D. Barlowes opinion, Becauſe in proceſſe of disputatiō the laſt Commencemēt in Cambridge, he defended the ſame; yea ſo, that he would haue no poſſeſſiō (but obſeſſion) in Christes time. Notwithſtanding that worthy Vniverſity would not ſuffer him at firſt to profeſse ſo groſse an error, but (inſerting this word Ordinary) compelled him to ſet vp his question to this effect, In theſe dayes there is no Ordinary poſſeſſion, &c. Now to what purpoſe is Poſſeſſion ſo ſimply denied? Marry, to cut Mai. Dorrels combe. For, if there be no Poſſeſſion at all, then Sommers was not poſseſſed, and then M. Dorrels ſuppoſed crowne of glory may proue but a withered garland. Nay verily. If this were ſo, yet they gaine nothing thereby, neither is M. Dorrels cauſe the worſe. For what if there be Obſeſſiō
               ? & ſo if Sommers were thus affected and tormented indeede, as he appeared in ſhew, is M. Dorrell then to be condemned as an impostor?

Yea further, admit Sommers to haue counterfaited: why ſhould M. Dorrell deceiued by him, be puniſhed? Was that good man, of reverend memorie (M. Fox) deceyued by Anne Brigges & Rachel Pindar, called into question for the ſame? Hee was not.
            But how is this abſolut deniall of poſſeſſion proved? Firſt, forſooth, by an Induction not vrged as a reaſon, but inſinuated like a fallacy, thus to be collected: Wil. Sommers, Tho. Darling, Kath. Wright, the ſeauen in Lancaſhire, &c. Martha Broſſier (whoſe matter is diſcourſed by Abraham Hartwell & publiſhed in the very nick with S. H. his Diſcouery) were coūterfeits: Therfore (as it is concluded p. 77.) a Magiſtrate ſaide to Mengus, Of 50. exorciſtes 49. are counterfeits. To whom Mengus anſwered: If I were not preſent, you would ſo iudge of me. O worthy Induction from a most ſufficient enumeration of vndoubted particulars. But marke (good Reader) how like a ſquint-eyed man S. H. in his parting blow lookes one way, and ſtrikes another. For in the title he pretendeth to diſcouer Maister Dorrells bad practiſing but with 4: and yet, in ſundry places of the diſcouery, hee laboureth to proue the 7. in Lancaſhire to be alſo counterfeits, yea, though he confeſſe

pa. 4. that, touching thē 
               examinations haue not bene taken. If the L.B. of London had tryed at first, how his Chaplaine could (by verie witt) without farther examinations haue made th' other 4. Counterfeits in the opiniō of all that would beleeue him, his Lp. might haue ſaued great charges, and paines bestowed in hunting after their ſuppoſed counterfeiting. Here is yet another note vpō this Induction not to be forgottē, viz. That S.H. preſuming (belike) to be borne out, doth call into question the ſentences of death giuen by her Maiecties Justices of Oier and Determiner vpon the Witches, that bewitched the 7. in Lancaſhire, and the boy of Burton, to the publique and perpetuall preiudice of thoſe her Maiesties Courts of Aſſiſes.
            Secondly, Abſolute deniall of poſſeſſion is faced out by a ridiculous and ſlight (not anſwering, but) evading from arguments framed by S.H. him ſelf from the word for poſſeſſion, &c. the refutation whereof I referre to ſome treatiſe that may be heereafter: alſo from the volūtary confeſſions of witches thē
               ſelues; who, at their death haue confeſſed, That they ſent Divels into parties poſſeſſed. Indeed, if witches by deniall would excuſe themſelues, Such deniall for ſundry reaſons

might bee thought inſufficient. But ſeeing many witches, in ſūdry Kingdomes & ages, haue, by their voluntarie confeſſions, iustified evidences and ſentences giuen against them, and when? Euen at their death when they ſee no hope to ſaue them ſelues by perſisting in deniall, what reaſon is there, why they may not bee thought guilty of ſending euill ſpirits into the poſſeſſed, whereof they were conuicted? S. H. auoucheth none, but ſuggesteth (pag. 39.) that learned men haue ſufficiently confuted this already. But S. H. are you aſhamed of your learned men, or of their reaſons, that you neither quote th'one nor ſet downe th'other? Must J helpe at a pinch? If memory faile me not (as it may be it did S. H.In his Diſcovery of witchcraft) M. Scot imputeth ſuch confeſſions to a ſtronge imagination ariſing from Melancholy the predominant humor of old women and ſuch like. O ſuperstitious Catholique Melācholy, that no leſſe ſtranglie thē ſtrongly deludeth ſo many young, aſwell as old, men, aſwell as women, and that at their executions! Tell me S. H. what you thinke bona fide: was it Melancholy that cauſed Hartley (who bewitched the 7. in Lancaſhire) ſtifly to deny, both at the barre and gallowes, his diveliſh witchcraft: & yet when he ſaw that breaking an halter would

not deliuer him from hāging (as the Divell had promiſed) then penitently to confeſſe, that all wherewith M. Starky (in whoſe houſe the 7. poſſeſsed were) had charged him, was very true? Yet admit the reaſon. But know withal, that your learned men intend theroby to dispoue not only poſſeſſion, but all witchcraft whatſoever, otherwiſe then by poyſoning. Are you S. H. of that opinion too? Why ſhould I doubt it? For doe not you hold (pag. 36.) That Witches cannot ſend Divels into men and women? and, Is it not as eaſie for witches to ſent Divels Into, as Ʋnto men? Heere Doctors doubt. But D. Barlowes reaſon at Cambridge ſtrikes all dead. For (ſaith he) one ſubſtāce cannot enter into another. Heere is a dead blowe indeede. For, Jf neither ayre (which is a ſubstance) nor meate can enter into our bodyes, what will become of vs? Jf either enter, why cānot the Divel, ſith he is a ſpirite? But admit that it is an harder matter to ſende the Divell Into, then Ʋnto a man: I meane ſo Ʋnto, as to torment him, yet (me thinkes) S. H. doeth holde the deniall of one, aſwell as of th' other. For, by th'authoritie of the ſame authours, who deny witchcraft in ſending Divells both Ʋnto & Jnto men,Lib. 1.6. he likewiſe indefinitly concludeth that

his diſcourſe against the cōfeſsions of Witches Againe, Is it not likely, That D. Barl
                     •
                   & Abrah. Hartwell belong to the L. B. of Can. S.H. to the L. 
                     •
                   of Lond. birdes of a fether will fly togeather? Further, D. Barlowes reaſon at Cambridge Why in theſe dayes there is no poſſeſſion, was this: Chriſt came to diſſolue the works of darknes, & vpon the Croſſe he triumphed ouer powers and principalities: Ergo, There is nowe no poſſeſſion. He may conclude aſwel, Ergo, There is now no witchcraft: yea no murder, no pride, no Jdolatry, &c. Moreover, There is reaſon why it is expedient for S. H. indefinitly and implicatiuely to make witchraft doubtfull. For, If there be no witchcraft at all, then may he conclude, All M. Dorrels poſſeſſiōs (which ar ſaid to be by witchcraft) must needes be counterfeitings. Who would looſe ſuch an argument? But conſider (good Reader) whether ſuch a concluſion tend not to the cōfirmation of Atheists. If ſo: may we not feare, that Witches & Atheiſts may hope for more fauour with thē, then M. Dor. The rather, if we cōſider 2. actions of S.H. his L. & maſter on friday 8. dayes at the Seſſion in Lond. Firſt, howe vnwilling hee was to finde Concerning Anne Ke
                     •
                  ke, ſpoken of in the end.Witchcraft if his L. could haue overruled that court: for notwithſtāding he heard ſufficiēt witneſſes teſtifying grieuous things, & ſaw a yōg girle falling into a moſt terrible fit

yet he ſmiled (at no laughing matter, as ſom of the Bench tolde his L.) ſaying, That hee ſawe nothing that might not be counterfeited, and tolde, how many Counterfeits he had lately diſcouered. Wherevpon Iudge Anderſon, and other of the Bench thought it neceſſarie for the ſatisfying of the Iurie to vrge the Scriptures for proofe that there is witchcrafte, and (of their owne knowledge) to tell of ſundry bewitched, yea poſſeſsed out of whom Diuels ſpake: and of a childe bewitched to death whoſe eyes were fast cloſed, yet when the Witch came in preſence they opened, and (as it were) ſtared vpon the Witch. Second: How earnest his L. was to free an Atheiſt then and there arraigned for blasphemie against God. For notwithſtanding his L. acknowledged that the Atheist had bene before the high Commiſſion for ſuch blasphemie, yet he pleaded that the ſecular power had nothing to doe with him vntill the ſpiritual iuriſdiction had pronoū
               ced him obstinate in his blasphemie. Ʋpon whoſe wordes the Atheist tooke holde and heart, openly and impudently to ſay, My Lord, if any heere can proove there is a God, I will beleeue it. Would the L. B. haue done ſuch a part if Mai. Dorrell had bene then and there arraigned for teaching

to coūterfeit poſſeſſion? To drawe towards an ende. Whereas S. H. his Diſcoverie conſisteth partly of matter of Opinion, viz. a cloſe fight against poſſeſſion, at least in theſe dayes: and of matter of Fact, viz. a bearing downe of Mai. Dorrell with a tumultuous riot of wordes as a Teacher of ſundry to counterfeit poſſeſſion: This (I hope) I may preſume to ſaye touching the former, that if S. H. will take in hande directly and ſyllogistically to conclude his negatiue opinion from the Scriptures, ſonne (no doubt) of M. Dorrels friendes (ſo oft by him provoked) wil returne (to vſe his own wordes pag. 324) matter ſufficient to ſhewe his skill in. As for the matter of Fact, this I dare boldly ſay: That if M. Dorrell doe not refute all imputations & arguments materiall, which are not ſufficiently anſwerd in this Collection (provided hee may haue libertie) all his friendes will abandon him: yea the Narrator, Publiſher of his apologie, and this Collector, if they be alive & make cōſcience of their wayes. I ſay, If they be aliue, becauſe if they be all one (as ſome may ſuppoſe, and I haue heard preſumptions giuen ſo to thinke) then they, in one, be departed this life.
            Jn meane while, I deſire thee (good Reader) to conſider one thing with me, that is,

whether it may not be concluded, That a
                  •
                Raking of riches doeth manifest the vnſatisfyed pouertie of a couetous minde; ſo the Raking of matter, euen from papistes, and that to no good purpoſe: The examining of M. Dorrell (at ſeuerall tymes) vpon 8. or 9. ſkore interrogatories; and the depoſing of 52. witneſſes (as S. H. reckoneth pag. 13.) doeth not manifest an vnſatisfied minde, and (by conſequence) the pouertie of S.H. his cauſe. Which point, that is, of the Prelates their not beeing ſatisfied (in their ſecret perſwaſion) touching M. Dorrel his guiltines, may the rather be conceaved, For that, within theſe fewe dayes, notwithstanding Ma. Dorrell, and Ma. Moore were both depoſed from the Miniſterie, and committed to cloſe priſon, there to remayne vntil order were taken for their further puniſhment, (as S. H. reporteth pa. 9.) yet for all that, they haue offered (by M. Barker the Register, who went of purpoſe to M. Dorrell in the Gatehouſe) libertie vpon theſe conditions, That they ſhould not iustifie their cauſe, nor meddle any more with prayer, and fasting for parties poſſeſsed.
            Which good motion of graunting libertie (J ſay not vpon ſuch conditions) to Preachers, of whoſe Ministery the Church may

haue good vſe, in theſe tymes, when Priests and Papiſtes multiply and practiſe ſo faſt, I could wiſh the Reverende Prelates would follow, and doe that of loue towards Chriſt his Church and Goſpell,
               Act. 16.3

                   39.23.18. which the Gouernours of Philippi did for feare of the Romanes, to wit, They deliuered Paul out of priſon with credit, whom they had puniſhed more ſeverely then casting out a Diuell had deſerued. But how ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to mooue the heartes of our Reuerend Prelates, Let me intreat thee (Christian Reader) to ſuspende thy iudgement in M. Dorrels till M. Dorrell, or ſome of his friendes haue made further aunſwere then heere is, or can bee made: and then to iudge as thou ſhalt ſee cauſe. And ſo I paſſe to the promiſed Report, accompanied with another of like argument.
         
         
            
            A REPORT, Contayning a brief Narration of certain diuelliſh and wicked witcheries, practized by Oliffe Barthram alias Doll Barthram of Stradbrook in the County of Suffolke, vpon Ioane Iorden the Servant of Symon Fox of the ſame Towne: For which, ſhe was arraigned before the right Ho▪ the L chief Iuſtice of England condemned and executed at S. Edmondsbury in Suffolke
the 12. of Iulye. 1599.
            
            ABout midſomer laſt, the ſaid Doll Barthram, falling out with the ſaid Ioane Iorden for refuſing to giue her of her maiſters goods, practiſed and deviſed, to afflict the ſaid Joane by witcheries: as, through Gods permiſſion by the meanes of Satā it came to paſſe; which in briefe was thus.
            Firſt the ſaid Doll Barthrā ſent 3. Toads to trouble her in her bed, not ſuffering her to reſt. The firſt, being thrown out into the middeſt of the chamber, returned, and ſat croaking on her beds ſide: which being thrown out of the window; another within fewe dayes after came and vexed her againe; which was taken and burnt. After that within a while came the 3d. which

Ioane was counſelled to burne her ſelfe; and going downe ſtayres to doe ſo, ſhe was violently thrown to the ſtayers foot, there lying (a while) for dead. And when this Toade began to burne, (which Simon Fox had put into the fire,) a flame aroſe at the ſtayers foote where the toade lay when Ioane fell, & grew ſo great, that it ſeemed to them to indanger the houſe, yet no hurt was don.

                   others. many of good accoumpt and credit, A Spirit (which had ben there the night before, and ſaid then, beeing asked, that his name was Gyles, & that he came down the chimney in the likenes of a cat) came nowe againe about eleven a clock at night; firſt ſcraping on the wals, then knocking, after that ſhufling in the ruſhes: and then (as his vſuall maner was) he clapped the maide on the cheekes about halfe a skore times as to awake her; and, (as oft times els he did) he kiſſed her 3. or 4. times and ſlauered on her: and, (lying on her breſt) he preſſed her ſo ſore that ſhe could not ſpeake; at other times hee held her handes that ſhe could not ſtirre, and reſtrayned her voice that ſhe could not anſwer.
            
               The Shape which they ſawe the Spirite then to haue, was a thick darke ſubſtance about a foote high; like to a ſugar lofe, white on the top. And (being charged) he did ſhoote vp in all their ſightes as high againe as he ſhewed himſelfe before.
            As this ſpirit had a ſhape, ſo had he alſo an audible voyce: by which he ſpake and vttered many thinges. This voyce was not the maides, neither from her, nor yet of any other ſaue of the ſpirit it ſelfe. For; (beſides that the maide denyed it,) ſhe & the ſpirit were heard ſpeak both at once; alſo, her lips were ſeene not to moue, when the ſpirit ſpake; and, ſome ſtanding neerer to th'one then to th'other, did ſenſibly diſcerne and diſtinguiſh both their voyces. Neither was this the voyce of any counterfait confederate; for, (to put this out of doubt) the houſe was ſearched, the parties in the maides preſence (except Io. Sheereman, M. Randall, and Sy. Fox) were ſtrangers, the roomes vnder and adioyning to her, were full of people, and the houſe was beſett with divers who came to ſee and heare theſe ſtrang accidents, which indeed they did; for the voyce was eaſily heard to them all.
            This Spirit being demanded diverſe queſtions,

returned anſwers; ſaying, (among diverſe other things,) Joane, Ioane, I come for thy life; J will haue it, I am a Boy, a Boy; my name is Gyles; an old woman that dwells in the ſtreete gaue mee that name, to witt, Doll Barthram; She ſent me; I haue ſerued her 10. yeares, yea 20. yeares; She is now in priſon, (as indeede ſhe was); Nan Barthram ſent me now; I will kill Ioane tomorrow night; J will teare her in peeces; She hath giuen her life and ſoule to mee (which Ioane in parte acknowledging, viz. that ſhe had given him her life, hee laughed Ho, Ho, Ho.) To this whē 
               John Sheereman defying him) replyed, that he ſhould not haue her life, he ſaid, I wil haue thine then; I come to thee, J come; & with that, offered towards him, to the great aſtoniſhment & feare of him and the reſt preſent. And yet thus for that time he vaniſhed away.
            But, not long after, he returned againe; in maner as at the firſt (except ſcraping the wals.) When, vpō occaſion of talke touching one Cavers wife, in the preſence of many, he ſaid: Tom, (which was another of the Spirites of the ſaid Doll,) and J, at Doll Barthrams commandement, did hang her. But first I led her into a ditch vp to the chyn and could not drowne her, and therefore

I brought her out againe. Then Tom brought a rope and put it vnder her chaps, and I pulled her vp and hung her. Which ſeemeth to haue ben ſo, becauſe of the ſtrangnes of it. For, the rope werewithall Cauers wife was hanged, was but put vnder her chaps, not about her neck: and the nooſe was ſo bigge, that three mens heds might haue ſlipt through it at once.
            Moreover, this Spirite then declared, That he, (at Doll Barthams cōmandment) had killed a child, in the womb of the mother, by nipping out the braines; and that hee entred into another partie and killed him, by tearing his heart in peeces. Both which ſeeme to be true alſo: for, the woman was deliuered of a dead child, & the man did dye in a very ſtrange maner; and both at the ſame time that the Spirit declared. Then, after many ſpeaches vſed by the ſpirit, as, that hee would kill Ione, and teare Iohn Sheereman in pieces; that he was their God; and that he would not be content with the life of Ioane only, but would haue alſo the liues of Fox, his wife, children, and cattell, and that by the commaundement of Doll Bartharm, hee went away for that night.
            But Satan and the Witch, nothing contented

with that which as yet had ben don, 
                  •
               eturned againe in more grieuous ſort then before. For, in the preſence of Of whō 4. were Sir Nicolas B

                  poſe to bring true report. many credible perſons, there was ſeene a lump to ariſe in her body as big as a mans fiſt; which aſcended vpwardes in her body till it came to her throate, & there ſetled as big as a mans arme. With this the maide was ſomewhat vnruly, and therefore was bound in a chaire with a long to well, very faſt. But ſhe (or rather the Divell in her) ſtrugled and ſtrained ſo ſore, that it brake in pieces. Being againe bound in the chair, ſixe ſtronge men leaned with their whole ſtrength thereon, each alſo ſetting one foote on the rounde of the chaire to keepe it down. But ſhe, (though ſo bound) notwithſtāding all their ſtrength, remoued the chaire round about the houſe, a yard at a time, they hanging thereon.
            After this fit ended, the maide was had to bed: And about eleaven a clock the Spirit came; not after his vſuall 
                  •
               aner, but with a great ſtroke on the bordes, like the fall of a greate ſtone. Wherewith, the people awoke, and the maide cried, Helpe, Helpe: & then, a thicke ſhadow was ſeene to goe vp to the maides bed. Shortly after which, the maide was takē out, & throwne ſo violētly againſt the wall, as if it would haue driven out the

ſide of the chamber. Then ſearch being made for the maid, ſhe was found lying vnderneath the ſtanding bed: From whence, it was as much as fower men could doe to pluck her. Neither was this great throw, and heavy waight, the only ſtrange thinges in this her fit: For, her eyes were ſunck into her head an inch. Her head and body were bent backwards, almoſt to her hips. She lay as it were dead. Her teeth were ſo faſt cloſed, that a man could not opē them, though with all his ſtrength he aſſayed it with his dagger and a key. And, (that which ſtrang is,) a ſtiffe dry Ruſh being put into her noſtrels, ſo far, as it might touch her braines in the iudgment of them that were preſent, yet ſhe moved nothing thereat; neither at the violent bending of her fingers; nor yet at a great quantity of Aqua-vitae, which was powred into her mouth.
            In which caſe ſhe having lyen halfe an hower, at laſt ſhe opened one of her eyes gazing there with very ſtrangly; then th'other, crying, ô Barthram, thou hast killed mee. Then, being layed in her bed, ſhe ſo ſtriued to get out, that all there preſent (which were not a few for ſuch a purpoſe,) could ſcarſe hold her therein. And this is the ſumme of that wch happened to this maide bewitched.
         
         
            
            Another Report of like Argument.
            IN Caſtle Alley neere Broken wharfe in London, there dwelt a witch called Anne Kerke; who for her notorious miſchievous witcheries heereafter in brief deſcribed, was arraigned in London the 30. of November 1599. before the right honorable the Lorde Anderſon & other of her Maieſties Iuſtices, and then condemned, and executed at Tyburne the 4. of December following.
            To let paſſe the Evidence, that of long time ſhe had ben ſuſpected for a witch; I will ſet downe the ſumme of th'other evidences giuen in againſt her.
            Firſt, this witch falling out with a woman in the ſtreete, ſaid ſhe would bee meete with her, or hers. Wherevpon the woman going home and ſitting by the fire with her child in her lap, it gaue a great skreeke, and was ſuddenly changed; and after that continually pined away till it dyed.
            After whoſe death, her other child going vp Bredstreet Hill, met with this witch; who asked her how her ſiſter did. But before ſhe could make anſwer, ſhe was ſtricken downe in a very ſtrange maner; her mouth beeing drawne aſide like a purſe, her teeth gnaſhing togeather, her mouth foming, and her eyes

ſtaring the reſt of her body being ſtrangely diſfigured. When the witch was gon, ſhe recouered out of this traūce; howbeit ſhe was ſtill oftimes caſt into the like. This, the maide her ſelfe depoſed: who being willed by the Lorde Anderſon, to To trie like if

               Gillams; who tolde them, that the childe was foreſpoken, and that the witch had ben (as indeed ſhe was) twice with the mother of the child before they came home; and that, for the childes recouery they ſhould cut of a piece of the witches coate with a payre of ſheeres, & burne it togeather with the childs vnder cloth: which they did, and the childe accordingly was healed.
            Againe, at another time, this witch fell out with an Inkeeper; and in revengement, bewitched his only childe ſo ſtrangely, as that by no means of Phyſik which he could get, it could be recouered; but ſtill it was from time to time tormented, till it dyed. But before the death, the Father (finding no helpe

by Phyſicke) went to a cuning man (as they call them;) who told him, that the cauſer of his childes torments was one that was converſant in his houſe: and (after promiſe made of not revealing the partie) he ſhewed him in a glaſſe this witch, Anne Kerke. After this, this man the Father of the childe, met this witch comming out of his neighbours dore, and making ſtay till ſhe was gon, tolde his neighbour that ſhe was a witch, and that ſhe had bewitched his childe to death. Wherevpon he going home, fell ſick and dyed.

Nayler dwelling in Thames ſtreet neere Broken wharf, ſhe tormēted his ſonne George in ſuch grievous maner that he dyed. So alſo did ſhe torment his daughter Anne till ſhe dyed: who was oftimes vexed wth a frenzines: and with an evill ſpirit, to which this maide in her Fathers hearing did often talke. And being demaunded who was the cauſer of theſe her torments, the ſpirit which was within her ſaid, that one would come after who ſhould For yet th

Who the next night after her ſiſters buriall, was tormented with an evill ſpirit, which ſpake in her oftimes in the hearing of her Parents; ſaying, Giue me thy liuer, thy lights, thy heart, thy ſoule,  then thou ſhalt be releaſed, then I will depart frō thee: alſo; Goe, take thy lace & hang thy ſelfe: Go into the next roome and hang thy ſelf in the iack rope, and ſo thou ſhalt be releaſed. She was oftimes grievouſly tormented and in a traunce, during which her mouth was turned to th'one ſide, her ioyncts ſo ſhrunke vp that the ſoles of her feete did beate togither, her ſhoulder bones did ſtrike one againſt another, ſo, as that they were heard to rattle, to the terror of them preſent. And (according to the wordes of the ſpirit in her ſiſter Anne) ſhe oft ſaid, that mother Kerke had bewitched her. And when the maide (according as ſome had willed her to doe) did reach forth her hands to ſcratch this mother Kerke, they were ſo faſt cloſed tha

But ſo ſoone as the witch came to the dore, ſhe fel into her former traūce, her handes being againe ſo cloſed as they could not be opened, Sir Rich▪ Martin himſelfe aſſaying it. Into the like traunce the maide did alſo fal being in the houſes of Sir Iohn Hart, & Sir Steph. Slaney (or Some) ſo ſoone as the witch (being by thē ſent for,) was entred into their dores: And the like alſo did ſhe fal into, being in the fields, at the ſame inſtant when the witch was bayled forth of priſon: as alſo being in the Seſſions houſe, when the iury were departing to cōſider of the matter. But that of Sir R. Martin is not heere to be omitted: who having heard that a witches hayre could not be cut; ſent for the ſaid An. Kerke, & cōmanded a Seriant to pull from her head 10. or 12. of her haires, & try if he could cut them. The Seriant did ſo; and offering to cut thē with a paire of Barbers Siſſers, they turned round in his hand: and the edges were ſo battered, turned, & quite ſpoiled, as that they would not cut any thing. Then the Seriant tooke the haire, and did put it into the fire to burne it; but the fire flew from it, and the haire in the middeſt thereof vnburnt.
            
               Who is wiſe that he may obſerve theſe thinges? The righteous ſhall ſee and reioyce, and all iniquity ſhall ſtop her mouth.
