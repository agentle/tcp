               Iob. 14. 14.
               If a man die, shal he liue againe? then all the dayes of mine appointed time will I watch, vntill my changing shall come.
            
            
               WEe are heere assembled this day (as I trust in the feare of GOD and loue of our CHRIST) not to pray for the dead, or sorowe euē as1. Th. 4. 13 other that haue no hope, being taught by the Spirit, that who dyeReuel. 14. 13. in the Lord, rest from their labours and are fully blessed: But we are assembled rather to gaine by ye seueritie of death, that which

for the most parte, we loose in the securitie of our life, viz: A true touch and feeling of our owne frailtye, taken from the dailye doomes of this declining worlde, whose flower (as you heere see) is fading, & beautie but a blossome.
            For surely it is true in the steddie bole of all the worlde, which is heere falne out in a tender branch: There is an appointed timeEccles. 3. 1 for all thinges vnder the Sunne: a time to plante, and a time to plucke vp: a time to build, and a time to pull downe: a time to gather, and a time to scatter: a time to rent and a time to sowe: a time to speake, and a time to keep silence: a time to laugh, and a time to weepe: a time to liue, and a time to dye: yea to dye, there is no remedie: Uni Deo nunquam senectus atra, nec mors imminet:
               Sophocles. 
               sed alia miscet domitor aetas omnia. Onelye God, neither olde age nor blacke death can ouertake, but for al other things, deuouring time, hath and will turne them topsie turuye.
            In regard whereof, holy & pacient Iob after much debate & many pleadings with the sinnes of his soule and sorowes of his heart, doth at last (as you may heere see) demurre

vpon the plea with death & doome, thereby bringing vnto him selfe (in solace of his soule) a state of inheritance indefeazible, with a Crowne of glorye that withereth not.
            And this is done by a thrreefolde necessitie laid vpon all flesh: 1. The first of dying, and that's but once: 2. The second of liuing againe, and that's for euer: 3. The third and last of watchfulnes, and that's but for a time, euen till the day of our changing shall come.
            The necessitye of our dying is the doore of life, the necessitye of our liuing againe, is the doome of death: the necessitye of our watchfulnes is the Calender of our daies, to witte, how we haue liued, how we doe liue, and how we purpose to liue vntil our changing shall come.
            Or thus: that of death, we deeme it the day of miserye: That of life againe, we holde it the day of glorye: That of watchfulnes, we reckon it for the day of grace: And so, as one floud puts on an other, these three hale and help vs on to happy dwelling, whereof if you loose a linke, you break the Chayne and silken thrid should winde

you out of the laberinth of this worlde, to the porte and paradice of your God. For no blessed life without a blessed death, and no blessed death without a blessed life: and then are we blessed in both, when we stand vpon our guard and are found watchfull.
            1. Now for the first I say with the Psalmist,
                  The crie of death. Ps. 89. 48. Gen. 2. 17. Heb. 9. 27 Dan. 6. 8. What man liueth and shall not see death? shal he deliuer his soule frō the hand of the graue? no, no, the decree of death is an imperial lawe, acted in paradice vpon Gods fayrest Creature, where sinne no sooner seizd but death entred, and hath euer since (like the lawes of the Medes and Persians) bene irreuocable.
            And though happily from the first death there lye an appeale to a better life, in the prerogatiue Court and high consistorie of our Christ, dead for our sinnes, but risen againe for our iustification: yet is there no repeale of that first lawe, by any latter acte, I say, no parliment to disanull the doome of death: No place priuiledged, no person exempt, no time to interrupt the decree therof, but like an omnipotent Queene and regent of al the world, where sinne hath kist, she euer killeth.
            
               There is no safetie any where. If Angels in heauen sinne, downe they must: If Adam in Paradice transgresse, out he must: If Iudas faile at the side of Christ, away hee must: where is a practise of sinning, there is euer a necessitie of dying, without either priuiledge of place, person, or presence: for thorow enuie of the Deuill came death intoWisd. 2. 24 this world, & they that hold on his part shall prooue it.
            I say then & dare avouch, that the matterThe reward of sin is death. of our sinning, is the cause of our dying, and that needes must, needes shall. Must thou needes sinne? then surely shalt thou die: sinne and death are hereditarie, they dwel in one house, & like Hipocrates twins, they laugh togeather, they weepe togeather, they liue together, they die together. And so shall till time bee no more, for noReu. 10. 6▪
                time of sinning, no time of dying, In the interim, our Fathers haue eaten a sower grape and the Childrens teeth are set on edge, the Ceders are fallen, how can the shrubbe stand? the Patriarches before the Flood, the Patriarches since the Flood, the holy Priestes and honorable Kings of Iudah and Israel, haue all sinned and are

all dead. And why should we liue?
            
               Ieremiah cryed, and so may I: O earth,Ch. 22. 29 earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord: young earth, old earth, middle earth, faire earth, strong earth, rich earth, heare the cry, your moulde is earth, your flesh is sinfull, and your condition is mortall. Ye Kinges of the earth, ye are but kinglie earth, sinne is your shame, & death is your due: you honorable mē, you are but honorable earth: you Gentlemen, you are but gentle earth, you learned men, you are but learned earth, you meane men, you are but meane earth: I say of you all, sin is your shame, and death, is your doome, and when the graue hath it due, then treade out the ground, & giue me the difference who is Princely, who is honorable, who is poore, base, and beggerlie? It may be your Tombes, Hearses and Sepulchers, doe set out your state, and shine to your praise, but vnder & within what's your rottennes better then others, whats your dignitie aboue the meanest?

there, and loe they were blackish and fallen to rottennes: I looked vpon his belly burst, & swarmes of wormes issued out: In the hollowes of his head, where once stood his christal eyes, two hungry Toades were feeding: The locks of his head were fallē, his teeth appeared, but his lippes were wasted & ye gristle of his nose being consumed, the very ground thereof was discouered. This when I saw, I said, deare Mother, where is now the beautie of Caesar? where is the worlde of his wealth? where be the troupes of his Nobles, Knights & Barons? where are the armies of his fighting men? Where is the prouision of all his delights? his hunting dogges, his coursing Steeds, his chaunting Birds, his guilt Palace, his Iuorie bed, his Princely Throne, his royall Wardrobe? where, where, are his goulden Lockes, and his faire feature? long it is not, O Caesar since all men dred thee, all Princes feared thee, all Citties did honour thee, yea & all the world did thee homage. Ubi nūc quaeso sunthaec omnia? quo abijt tua magnificentia? Where I pray thee now are all these honors, & whither is thy puissance gone?
            
               To which my deere Mother answered with all pietye and reuerence, O my sonne, all thinges fayled him when life left him. And now his possession is heer in a Tomb of three Cubits long with corruption and rottennes in the kingdome of darknes.
            Such (my deer bretherē) & no better is the condicion of all flesh: The meanest & the mightiest (as you see) are al of one molde there is no difference in the graue: and as of men, so may I say of Cityes, Kingdomes and Monarchies of this worlde: They had their pride, and they haue their period: for goe ye (as saith the Prophet) to Calneh andAmos. 6. 2 see: and from thence goe you to Hamath the great: then goe downe to Gath of the Philistims: look vpon Ioppa, behold Tarsus, wonder at Niniuie the pride of Assur, gaze vpon Babilon the beautye of all theIsai. 13. 19

            But leaue we a little these dead carkases of elder times, with the cause of their ruines, which was their sinne: & come we neerer home, euen to that which wee feele in our bones, and finde in our flesh as harbengers of deathes approach, and deeper printes of our mortalitye.

                and say: their day shall euer dawne, but I say nay, for euen your flesh is but grasse, and the grace thereof, is but as the flower of grasse, yea oftentimes, for that your sins are the more, your danger is the greater (I say) take heede, your blade being greene, it is sooner blasted: your vessel being new, it is sooner tainted: and your plant being tender, it is sooner supplanted, by the violence of sinne which is the fier, and fuel of death. Seneca saith well: Iuuenes mortem habent atergo, et senes ante oculos. Young men haue death at their backes, and olde men before their face, like Israels hoste, who had the red Sea before, & Pharoes Armie behinde,Exod. 14. both ineuitable gulffes and readie to deuoure.

thou wel assuredly, that thouseest without and feelest within, both young men may die, and old men must die: And neuer deeme it a new thing, that is so ancient, or thinke it strange, that is so continuall: nor call it an euil (properly thine) which is so cōmon with al the world. The first age had it, it may pleade antiquitie: the second ageThe plea of death. felt it, it may pleade cōtinuāce: and this last age hath it, it may pleade a propertie in all flesh, till sinne and time shall be no more.
            The vse in respect of the doctrine is this, that though wee finde in our bones, and feele in our flesh, a necessitie of dying, yet we forget our selues, we forget our sins, yea ye molde & matter wherof we are made, & vn til it come (as now) the opening of graues, the imbalming of bodies, the wearing of blackes, and the losse of dearest friendes, there is no passion of our immortallitie, there is no impression of our eternity.

            I say then (& not I but the Spirit of God for me, speaking out of this text and truth) That it is Epicurisme, Atheisme, and the greatest Apostacie from faith that may be, to say, Let vs eate and drinke, tomorroweIsa. 22. 13 Old Atheisme.
                we shal die, & so an end: or to say with the wicked miscreants wisd. 2. 2.

and let not the flower of youth passe by vs: Let vs crowne our selues with rose buds before they be withered, let al be partakers of our wantonnes: let vs leaue some token of our pleasure in euerie greene field: & as for rigor, rage, & tiranny, whats that to vs when we are dead? come let vs oppresse the poore that is righteous, let vs not spare the widdow, nor reuerence the white haires of the aged, but say they haue liued too lōg, let our strength bee a law, and let the thing that is feeble bee reprooued as vnprofitable.
            Thus did the Atheist speake in the daies of old, out of the error of their soules, thus did they practise from a graceles resolution: the Lord deliuer the land from such a burden, his church from such pelfe, & our Prince from such a people, to whome I may say (if any there bee that so remaine yet vnreformed after so acceptable a time, and free offer of all grace and Godlinesse) I may say without repentāce, they are a damned crew and depriued of glorie, who for that they will not finde out the Lord in his mercies whilst they liue, shal be sure to be found out in iudgement, by him, when they are dead:

            Onely Paules plea for life againe, shallThe plea of life. stand as a ground for all the rest, whose seueral reasons to proue the resurrection, layed downe to the Church of Corinth, I referre you vnto, resting vppon the first, as a butteris or binding stone for all the rest, which is this: Christ is risen againe, the first1. Cor. 15. fruites of them that sleepe, wherupon I inferre, if he be first, wee must second him: if he be gone before, we must follow after: if he be risen, we may not rest: for where the head is, of congruence must all the members follow.
            And now that Christ is risen againe fromthat christ is risen the dead, it is apparant by these seuerall proofes. First it is promised in Paradice,

so to be when God said to Sathan, hee shallGen. 3. 15. breake thine head, and thou shalt bruse his heele, bruse he may by death, but breake he may not. Thine it is ô Christ to breake sathan, sinne and death, not in the heele, but in the head, neuer to rise vp in judgement against vs. 2 Secondly his resurection from the dead, was prophecied in Iudah, by old Iacob. Gen. 49. 9. by a Lyon couchant vnder a painefull passion, yet passant too, by a glorious resurection: so said Iacob, as a Lyons whelpe shalt thou come vp from the spoile, my Sonne Iudah (meaning in a misterie from the spoile of Hell, sinne, and death, to the glorie of Heauen, life and immortalitie) our english Iudah hath this honor in her armes and wee owe her homage, our heauenly Iudah hath this honour in his person & we owe him adoratiō: al ye faithfull of Iudah take this honour to your soules, & blesse your christ in the scutchin of your hearts, carrye him, ô carrie him foorth in your Christian marche, against all incounters: and say, terror hic est hominum, qui
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   hunc gerit est Agamemnon, which I may english thus.
            
               
               This Lyon heere of Iudah tribe a terror is, to men and Diuils desperat debar'd of blis:
               Who beares him as his Crest, more puisant he then Graecian guide, with all his chiualrie.
            
            3 Thirdly, his resurection was figured by Sampson Iudg. 16, who at midnight rose & Iudg. 16. 3 conueyed away the gates of Azzah and bare them vp to Hebron. The gates of Azzah are the bands of death, which our true Sampson did breake in the night, & silence of his resurrection, and in despite of death, bore vp his blessed body to Heauen, where now it abides a pledge of our inheritance. Haue I not power to lay downe my life, & Ioh. 10. 17 18 haue I not power to take it vp againe?
            4. Lastly it was signified in the heaue offering, shaken vp, shakend vne, andExo. 29. 24 shaken vp againe: so was our Christ in body, the substance of this shadow, tost to and fro in the hazard of this world, vp to the crosse downe to the graue, and yet vp againe to glorie.
            What should I say more? see the vaulteMar. 16. 6. 7. where they laide him, (saith the Angell) all hollow & emptie: ther's the graue, where

be the Corpes? ther's the Shrine, whereis the Sainct? Indeede hee is risen, hee is not heere: goe to Galilie there shall yee see him, (as he hath said) why seeke ye the liuing amongLuk, 24, 5 10, 20▪ 17 the dead? Quem mortuum queris, viuentem tangere non mereris: Marie thou deseruest not to feele him aliue, whom still thou seekest thus dead: nor was this Sermon preached by the Angell to her alone, but was afterward mightily confirmed by many seueral apparitions of our Sauiour Christ, ere he left this world: yt if in the mouth of two or three witnesses euerie truth should be established, this so acceptable a Doctrine of Christ his resurection from the dead, might want no testimonye: eyther of these women, of Cephas,

            And thus (my deere bretheren) beeing fully assured of the Lords resurrection, weThat we shall rise. 2. co, 4, 14 are well secured of our owne, knowing (as the Apostle saith) that he which hath raised vp the Lord Iesus, shall raise vs vp also by Iesus, and set vs with the Saints in euerlasting

tabernacles, whereof yet lest any the weakest reedin this assemblie might faile in iudgement, and so saint in hope, I haue thought good, without straine of Scripture, to secure your religious hearts of your owne resurrection, by these few grounds of Faith following.
            First for that it is in the will of the FatherIohn, 6, 3
                     •
                   40▪
                so to haue it: as also a worke of the Sonne so to effect it, for this (saith Christ) is the will of him that sent me, that euerie man which seeth the Sonne & beleeueth in him shold haue euerlasting life, & I will raise him vp at the last day: will the Father haue it, who shall resist his wil? will the Sonne worke it, who can resist his power? & if in any work,Rom, 1. 4. assuredly moste of all in this hath the Lord declared himselfe mightilie to be the Son of God, touching the Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead: his & ours. I say, his and ours: because hee that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified areHeb. 2, 1.

                builde vppon, is the Lords oathe, that by two immutable thinges, wherein it is vnpossible that God should lie, we might haue

strong consolation, he that hath former he said it is his wil, he hath likewise said it is his worke, and the Lord his Say, might be our assurāce: yet God, willing more aboūdantly to shew vnto the heires of promise the stablenes of his counsell, hath bound himselfe by an oathe; of old thus: as I liue, I willEz, 33, 11, not the death of sinner, &c. Of new thus: verily, verily, I say vnto you, the houre shalIoh, 5, 25, come, and now is, when the dead shal heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it shall liue, where God hauing no greater to sweare by, swore by himselfe as he is life, and by his Christ as he is truth: wheruppon Tertullian infers this blessing, O nos felices quorum causa deus iurauerit: sed ô nos infelices, si ne iuranti Deo credimus. O happie wee for whose good, God himselfe hath sworne: But ô wee most vnhappye if vppon his oathe wee doe not beleeue him. Tollit diuinitatem, qui tollit veritatem, wee greeue the deitie, if wee checke the veritie.
            3. A third assurance, is the instrument wee hold by, euen our letters pattents from the King of heauen: I meane the olde

            4. A foorth ground of our future resurrection, is taken from sufficient testee, and clowd of witnesses compassing vs round on euery side, Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, though in diuers ages of the worlde, yet all making good this one truth from one God, & Spirit of our Lord Iesus Christ, by which they spake: Enoch (as Iude saith) the seauenth from Adam

Daniel said, many of them thatDan, 12. 2 sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake▪ some to euerlasting life, some to shame and perpetuall contempt.

            What should I say more, the new Testament is rather in the practise, then proof of this Doctrine: and Paul is peremptory1, Cor▪ 15, 42, that it is sowne in corruptiō, but riseth in i

corruption: sowen in dishonour, but riseth againe in glorie: sowen in weakenes, riseth againe in power: sowen a natural bodie, riseth againe a spirituall body: for there is a naturall bodie, and that shall fall, but there is a spirituall bodie, and that shall rise, and all is but one in the substance of beeing: the difference is of well beeing, as now being made more honorable vppon the fall by Christ, who shall change our vile bodies,Phil. 3, 21 that they may be fashioned like vnto his glorious bodie, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things vnto himselfe.
            Yea and to make it a palpable and feeling Doctrine, as to the heart, so to the hand of each Christian: all the Apostles in one Iohn, and one Iohn for all the Apostles, brings in the verdict thus: That which we1, Ioh, 1. 1 haue heard, which wee haue seene with our eyes, which we haue looked vpon, & these handes of ours haue handled, declare wee vnto you. Hands haue handled, what meaneth that? Woe is mee to tell: doubtfull Thomas demur'd vpon the Doctrine, tillIohn, 20 24, &c. his itching fingers had fetched it out of the prints of the nailes, & his sinful hand out of

his sore side: How bee it vpon the touchNot sore but open his heart resolu'd into sighes, & his eyes into teares, when hee said with an holy resolution: my GOD, my Lord: my God, I am thy creature, my Lord, I am thy redeemed: I finde thee risen▪ and I feele I shal be raysed: Thy woundes are deepe enough to pleade thy death, & sufficiēt wide to purchase life for me, and all the worlde.
            For conclusion of all, let Christ his witnesse bee instar omnium and stand for all; who to take away the doubt, forbids the wonder of our new repaire, saying, maruellIohn. 5. 28 29 not at this, for the houre shall come, in the which all that are in graues shall heare his voice and come forth.
            5. Fiftly we are well assured▪ that we shal rise againe, by double pledge or hostage: 1. First of the soules of the Saints▪
               Reu. 6, 9, 10. 11. now lodgers in Heauen vnder the Altar, killed for the word of GOD, and testymonye which they maintained, whose loud crye is after a deliuerance of their owne bodyes, and of vs their long detayned bretheren, to whome silence was inioyned for a while, that they should rest vntill their fellowe-seruants and bretheren.

that should bee killed (euen as they were) were fulfilled. 2. Secondly of their bodyes, lodged in their graues, there to remaine as lodgers for vs, likewise vntill the time that all thinges bee restored, GodHeb. 11, 40. prouiding this good for vs that they without vs should not be made perfect.
            6, A sixt assurance is the pawne of the Spirit of God within vs: for, as the ApostleRo. 8. 11 saith, if the spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead dwel in you, he that raised vp Christ frō the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his spirit that dwelleth in you. And now my bretheren how this spirit hath entred & wimbled into your soules to make passage for this Doctrine, I know not, reade the caracters of your own hearts, you are spiritual: I feele no spirit but mine own, yet I hope well, that the cheareful spirit of God mooueth within you, & lifteth vp your sad & pēsiue spirits this day, from the dead graue to the blessed hope of immortalitie.
            7. Seauenthly we are secured per Arram: when the earnest is giuen it strikes the bargaine, & part of the debt is paied: so was it whē vpō the resurectiō of Christ, the grauesMath. 27▪ 52. 53. yeelded part of their dead as an earnest

of the generall resurrection, and full payment to come, then contracted betwixt Christ and the graue, binding both alike: the graue to deliuer the rest of her dead, and Christ to receaue all to life, and immortalitie.
            8. The eight and last, yet not the least Anchor of our sure hope and hold, is our possession of heauen already taken, whither our head is gon before, and there sits in potioribus
               Ioh. 14. 3. Ro. 8. 34 Hebr. 9. 24 
               Dei at the right hand of the Father in the best place of heauen, that the head and the members might be togeather: So then (I say) in the Man Christ we make our claime: in the Man Christ hath euerie one flesh, blood, bone and portion: I beleeue I shall liue where my flesh liueth, I hope I shall reigne where my head reigneth, and I knowe assuredly that I shall bee glorified where my portion is exalted.
            These groundes of faith (my bretheren) are so many nailes of the sanctuary, to fasten vs in hope to the hold where Christ our redeemer is: they are so many Chrysolits, Saphiers, and Emeralds, to support the wall of the holy Cittie, where wee shall dwel, and so many Pearls they are, to garnishRe. 21▪ 21
               
the gates of the holy Temple, for the Saints entrance: where the light of the Lambe is, the people which are saued shall walke in the light of it, and as Iohn saith, the glorie and honor of the Gentils (whereof you are) shall bee brought into it. Lord what is man that thou art so mindefull of him: or the Sonne of man that thou shouldest thus visite him in mercie, and prouide for him in glory.
            And yet my beloued, I know not howe, but notwithstanding all these proofes, and this my text, yet hath not the tempter ceased from the beginning of the world vnto this day, eyther like a roaring Lyon, feircely to assault, or like a Serpent by deceite craftily to impugne the same, yea it is a woeEph. 2, 2, 3 and a wonder to see how mightily the Diuell hath preuailed in the Children of disobedience, to worke their iust condemnation through mis-beleefe, euen in this point of the resurrection, & of our liuing againe: whereof I haue thought good to giue you a taste of their different errors, the rather to season you in the knowne truth.

The Marcionits say, wee shall bee turned into the nature of Angels: and the Ualentinian Heretickes into the nature of Deuils: the Appelleits thinke the flesh shal simbolize into the Spirit, & that the spirit shal vanish into the sostayre: the Chiliaste we are called the Millenarie Heretickes, doe dreame of a ciuil gouernmēt for a thousand yeares heere on earth, wherein they thinke the Godly shall liue with Christ in all delights & delicacie, & then goe to heauen in the eight thousand yeare of the world.
            But all these different errors and Heresies are mightily confounded by the alone spirit of God, in these words of my text: If a man die hee shall liue againe▪ as and if the truth should say, that graue that shutteth

shall open againe, that bodye which falleth shall rise againe, that man which dyeth shall liue againe, not in part, but in whole, not another from that it was, but the verie same that now it is: These my feete shall treade in his Courts: these my handes shall bee lift vp to his praise: these mine eyes shal behold his glory: these mine eares shall be filled with that heauenly melodye: yea and this my spirit shal reioyce in God my maker, my sauiour, my redeemer, my glorifier: I say this my bodye and this my soule once feuered on earth, with a wofull farewell, shall meete againe in heauen, neuer to part▪ but followe the LambeRe. 14. 4. whither euer he goeth.
            And thus hauing cleered in some measure the necessitie of our liuing againe, with an assured hope to all Gods Children of a ioy ful resurrection to come, it remaines we presse the Doctrine; yet further to your comfort, and tell you how wee shall bee changed, and when.
            For the first, rise we shall with these veryeIob, 19. bodies, of flesh, skin, blood & bone▪ nor shal the least ioynt sinew or Artery bee lost, but found and fashioned to the rest of the

members, to giue the body all feature, grace and beautie. There shall bee no transubstantiacion from one substance into another, but an alteration of quality tending to further perfection: and therefore wee say with one who said well, Gloria non tollit sed perficit naturam: our glorie shall not destroy our nature, but perfect it.
            And for distinction of ages, there shall beHowe wee shall bee changed Isaiah▪ 65. 20.
                no more there, (as saith the Prophet) a Childe of yeares, nor an olde man that hath not fild his daies, that is in this wonderfull worke of restauration, there shal be no weakenes of youth, not infirmities ofNo distinction of ages in heauen, no maime, no imperfection. age, but all shall bee fresh and flourishing: for as when GOD first created man and woman, hee made them not eyther▪ Infants, old, crooked, or deformed, but strong, ripe and beautifull: so in the resurrection (which is called a new creation:) It is not like, but shal be conformable to the first: if not much more excellēt: nor doe I doubt, but as the Apostle saith, wee shall all meete together vnto a perfect Man▪ and vnto theEphe. 4. 13 measure of the age of the fulnes of Christ, so fully blessed with daies, glory and immortalitie.
            
               This so wonderful change, and excellent state, is shadowed out vnto vs by Christ his transfiguration vppon the holy mounte, when the fashion of his countenance wasMath. 17. 1, 2, &c. changed, and his garments white and glistred, splendor infacie, splendor in vestimentis, sic gloria in capite, gloria in membris: brightnes in the face of Christ, with brightnes in his garments, is nothing else but glorie in the head, and glorie in the members.
            This sawe the disciple whome the Lord loued, when with a feeling soule and spirit,1, Ioh. 3▪ 2. he said, dearely belooued: now are wee the Sonnes of God, but it is not yet made manifest what we shall bee, for we knowe that when he shall bee made manifest (meaning Christ▪) wee shall be like him: for wee shall see him as hee is: like him, see him, and see him as hee is: ô excellent state of immortallitie, and soueraigne dignitie of Gods elect! to bee like him is much, to see him is more, but to see him as he is, moste of all.
            
               Paul saw the like when he longed afterPhil, 3. 20. 21 a deliuerance, and said, wee looke for the Sauiour euen the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may bee

fashioned like vnto his glorious bodye, according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all thinges vnto himselfe: whereuppon I may inferre to your further ioy, and greater wonder, thus: That wee shall bee changed, is much, that our vile bodies shall bee changed, is more, but that our vile bodye vppon the change shall bee fashioned like vnto the gloryous body of Iesus CHRIST, is moste of all: Manye fashions there are in this worlde, and all weare out of fashion. There's but one suite for the Saints of GOD, and for that it's cut after the best Patterne viz. after CHRISTS, it neuer weareth or waxeth olde, but is alwayes faire, fresh and glorious: had wee been apparelled like Aaron in his holye
                  •
               obes, or like Salomon in his Royall array, had wee put on the brightnesse of Angells vpon our change, wee might haue thought our selues sufficientlye graced, but▪ as and if all that were not sufficient: The Lord hath changed our vile bodie▪ that it might bee fashioned like vnto his glorious bodye.
            And this will hee doe when our case

is most desperate, euen finde vs out whenWhen ou4 neede is greatest Christ is nearest & his mercies are preuentions. Lu. 10. 34

            For it is an excellencie in our Christ, and a mercie infallible, found true in the practise of his pyetye, euen then to shewe mercye when wee are mosse miserable: then to feele him nearest, when wee deeme him furthest gone: his graces to abound when our sinnes doe superabound: I say, his mercies are preuentions euer meeting with our miseries, and then when wee are moste wofull and wanting.

               ming shal rise againe: whence I reason thus, in the first Adam we all fel by sinne to die once. In the second Adam we shall all rise, by his righteousnesse to liue euer, but in sorte different: he as the first fruite, we as an after crop at his comming shall rise againe, euen at his comming shall rise againe, so saith the text, and not before, so say I. The inferrence is good, else were the order inuerted, wherat principallie the Apostle aymeth,Col. 1. 18. which is, that Christ might haue the preheminēce, prime and pride of the resurrection, if I may so say.
            Againe it is said by the same Apostle, that1 Th. 4, 15 at the Lords comming such as remaine shall not preuent them that are asleepe, no

that are aliue: but the Lord shall preuent both and togeather, all shall be caught vp in the cloudes, to meete the Lord in the ayre, and so be euer where he is. The diuision is perfect & good, for at the comming of Christ to iudgement, all bodies shall eyther sleepe in their graues dead, or bee abiding vppon the earth aliue, and for their passage into heauen, none shall bee before or after other. The time was when that otherIohn, 20. 4 Disciple did out runne Peter to the Sepulchre, and euen now wee see, one hasteth to put another in the graue: but then when the Trumpet shall blowe, and the dead shall rise: all shall goe frō their Sepulchers at once vp together, meete together, and so for euer be with the Lord.
            Further for better proofe of this Doctrine, there is set downe by the Apostolicke Author,Heb. 11. 2. a choise register of Gods Saints, from Abel the iust, downe to the daies of the Machabees, by the honorable▪ Patriarches, worthy Iudges, renowned Kinges, inspiredHeb. 11, 39, 40, Prophets, who all through faith obtained good reporte, but receiued not the promise: God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they without vs should not be made perfect.
            
               I say, receiued not the promise at full▪ as inioying their desired Christ, not fullie come, in the day of grace by his death, to purge their soules from sinne, nor come in the day of glorie, by his life, to fine their bodies from corruption: God prouiding this good for vs, that they without vs, neyther in grace or glory, should bee fully perfected. How be it I deny not, but their soules were fullie saued, by the vertue of Christ his death and resurrection, which they foresawe and felt in their hearts, and thereforeIf in heauen, ergo neither in the limbee of popish purgatorie, or limbus pa trum.
                vpon their dissolution were taken vp in soule into the very heauens, where now they are, with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Mat. 8. 11. But their flesh doth rest in hope, so (as I may say of them, and of all the dead, as Peter did of the Patriarch Dauid) Dauid is not ascended into heauen: And ifAct, 2, 26 34 Psa. 110, 1 Heb. 1, 13.

possession til al thinges be restored, and then make good thy purpose, with thy promise, I goe to prepare a place for you, and if IIoh 14. 2, 3, goe, I will come againe and receaue you vnto my selfe: that where I am, there may yee bee also.
            But if all these Scriptures, like nailes ofHebr. 12, 22, 23, 24, the sanctuarie, will not fasten thee to this holde: then search the heauens, for thy better resolution: see into that secret, and who be there? Hebr. 12. 22. &c. Mencion is made of Mount Syon, which is the celestiall Ierusalem: and the Cittie of the liuing God: to which blessed assemblie the elect of God are incited to ioyne themselues as free Denisons, & to be Infranchised. Now who be there, tell if thou canst? let the Spirit speake and all flesh bee silent.
            There saith the text, are the companie of innumerable Angels, and the congregation of the first borne which are written in heauen: There is God the Iudge of all, and the Spirits of iust and perfect men: there is Iesus the meadiator of the new Testament and the blood of sprinckling, that speaketh better thinges then the blood of Habel.
            
            
               Whence I inferre, (to passe the rest and to come to that which more neerelie concerneth the matter in question,) that there are onely the spirits of iust and perfect men but neither bodie, blood or bone, other then that of Iesus Christ, the mediator of the new Testament, whose blood speaketh better thinges then that of Habels: For the blood of Habel cryed reuenge, but the blood of Christ euen there sprinckling, as it were inHe, 12, 24 his Fathers face, cryeth pardon, pardon.

                heauen but that of Christs, where then are the bodyes of Henocke and Elias, the one taken away before the Flood, and the other after in a fiery Chariot? I answere with the learned, whose iudgements I reuerēce, as to inquire where they became is meere curiositie, so to say they bee in heauen, is ouer bolde presumption: and if I should say with Dauid Kimhi, not the meanest interpreter of the Hebrues: that in the taking vp of Elyas, his garments were consum'd with fire, except his Mantell which fell from him, yea and that himselfe was extinguished: so as euerie one of the Elements of his body dissolued and return'd to the Element whereof it was, but that his Spirit passed to heauen, it were no singular opinion, for of the verie same minde, Oecolampadius seemeth to bee in his exposition vpon the last of Malachie.
            
            But for vs it is sufficient, that their translation shew there is a better life prepared: & if wee make it a Sacrament eyther of our resurrection frō the dead, or last taking vp into heauen, if we make it a testimonie of the immortallitie of soules & bodies, I holde it

may well stand with the Analogie of faith, and be as Tertulliā
                sayth, documents of our perfection to come, for the rule is good, multa tribuuntur Symbolis quae tantum sunt rerum significatarum: many things are said of figures which are onely true in the thing they signifie. Therefore if any man say, they are taken vp and glorified in body, as in soule: it is onely true in that they signifie, and not in Symbole.

            The Rhemistes vpon the same place,Heb, 11 5 charge vs Protestants to bee Sectaries,

for that wee holde this Doctrine, their words are these: heere it appeareth that Henocke yet liueth and is not dead, against the Caluinistes.
            
            Mr. Fulke answereth the charge, and layethIn his mar ginall note Heb, 11. 5
                downe his iudgement in these wordes: It appeareth not that Henocke yet liueth in bodye, more then Moses or Elyas, but that he was translated by God, out of the world, & died not after the cōmon maner of men, with this marginall note, more fully to expresse his minde in the point, Enocke not still liuing.
            
            But as for any passage into heauen, that Enocke or Elias had in bodie or locall being there, which is the maine point in controversie: he is so farre from that opinion, as in an other place, he is bolde to vouch the contrarie in these verie wordes: It is euidentIn his Annotat. Reu. 11. 3. Against the Rhemist. indeede that Elias was taken vp aliue, but not that hee contynueth aliue, yea, because it is said expreslye that he was taken vp into heauen, it is certaine that his bodye was not carryed into heauen▪ for Christ was the first, that in his whole humanity ascended into heauen: Ergo (say I) with Mr. Fulke whose learning, iudgement

and authoritie I much reuerence, and so may the Church of England, that yet there is no Bodye in Heauen but that of Iesus christs: for hee is the beginning, and the first begotten of the dead: (as the ApostleCol. 1. 18. saith) that in all thinges, he might haue the preheminence.
            Exiled Bale in his image of both Churches, and in his chaste Paraphras vpon the cited place, Reuelation 11. inferreth thus against the Popish schoole Doctors, who wold haue the two witnesses there mencioned to be Enocke and Elias: vnlike it is saith he, that God should call witnesses from the dead: And what Godlie wise man can giue more to the figure then to the veritie, more were they not priuiledged from death, then Christ was: though God wold not then haue it so to be knowne, to declare his wonderfull worke.
            Onely that which may deceaue is the Originall word, Lakac, which found in other places of Scripture else where, doth implye rather a taking away by death, then any trāslation from death: as in the 4. of Ionah where the prophet prayeth yt God wold take away his life: and Ezech. 44. 16. where

the Lord saith, beholde I will take from thee the pleasure of thine eyes, meaning his wife: the same original in both places is all one with that of Enocke Gen. 5. And therefore I see not yet why it may not inure to the same sense and signification, vnlesse we may deeme that Ionah prayed for any such translation, or that Ezechiels wife was so translated indeede, which may not be, for that the Prophet liued longer after, and Ezechiels wife was found dead at euen: and for the newe testament it is familiar with Christ and his Apostles, to call death a translation or taking away to blessednes, as Luke 9. 51. Iohn. 13. 1. and 17 1. In all which places the Greeke will beare it to be a translation, or taking away to a better life, yet euer by a true and certaine death.
            And therefore I answere to that of the Hebrues, where it is said: by faith Enocke
               Heb. 11. 5. was translated, that he shold not see death, that though happily his departure out of this life was extraordinary without passion, sickenes, or greenance: yet was it a dissolution, and such as left a bodye behinde, else why saith the Text, that these, whereof Enocke
               
was one, without vs should not bee made perfect: had hee been taken vp and glorified in bodye as in soule, hee had been perfect without vs: but because the Scripture plainely saith, that hee without vs should not bee perfected, I holde, as yet in bodie he is no more glorified then wee or the rest of that Calender.

               ght commit the sinne in adoring his dead bones, of whome whilst hee liued they had so great a reputation of all pietye and holines.
            So may I say of Henocke and Elias, inGen. 5. 24. Heb. 11, 5 that, as the text saith, they are gone, not seene or found, they are taken rom buriall, and from all vsage of this world: least succeeding ages might adore them dead, whom they so honored aliue: for not found, not seene, we say of mē rather lost on earth then gone to heauen.
            
               Againe when Christ was transfiguredLuk. 9, 31 vpon the Mount: it is said that Moses and Elyas talked with him, and tolde of his departure which hee should accomplish at Ierusalem: and shall wee say that the one was more translated then the other, more perfect or more glorified then the other, pardon mee, if I pleade a like perfection in both: If Elias, then Moses: if not Moses, then not Elias, but it is plaine in the ScriptureDeut. 34. 5 that Moses dyed: and so it is of Enocke and Elias in the generall, otherwise how should that sentence of Scripture bee veryfied? Hebrues. 9. 27. It is appointed to men that they shall once dye: if wee shall then conclude and say from the premisses: that by diuine dispensation and for the time, Moses & Elyas tooke vp their bodies to associat Christ in the glorification as did the Saintes, who ryse with him to accompany him in the resurrection: when hauing performed that which they were appointed to doe, they were dissolued againe, as before, I holde it may well stand with the Anolagie of faith: for that the Scripture saith concerning Christ. Act. 13. 34. God raised him vp from the dead, no more

to returne to corruption, as and if others might twise returne, where Christ should but once see the graue.
            As for the Fathers doubtfull iudgementOf Fathers there anenst, I say: as I haue euer said, I reuerence their gray haires, but I blesse eternitie: nor dare I subscribe to all the Fathers in the present point, for that they are variable, nor to any one of them further then hee hath good warrantie out of the word, which is euer like it selfe, and stable in al truth. The Rhemistes would prooue in their annotations vpon the 11. of the Apocalips two speciall pointes of Doctrine against vs, to make good their Antichriste yet to come. 1. First that Enocke and Elias yet liue, shall preach in the time of Antichrist, and suffer martirdome. the

                that they now liue in Paradice: and for denying of these two positions, they say we

                Protestants are too contentious, and incredulous, the matter being cleare (as they auer) in the opinion of all antiquitie: and to that ende they presse vs with the sway o

antiquitie there anenst, whence I resolue and conclude. To say with some of the fathers, concurring with our aduersaries, that Enocke and Elyas be yet in Paradice is idle: to say they shall fight against Antichrist, in the ende of the world, and suffer Martirdome is more idle, to say they be yet aliue is dangerous, but to say they be dead as all othersHeb. 9, 27 are, is without all danger, and whereupon neuer grew schisme in the Church of God, neuer greefe to conscience, or checke to the Royall dignitie of our Christ, whose sole and soueraigne preheminence of being in heauen bodily, I holde, as an excellencie in him, and a blessing to vs: yet so as to beleeue or not to beleeue, that Enocke & Elyas be there, may bee no barre to our saluation, for that I doubt not but milions of soules shall bee saued, who neuer heard or sought into that secret.
            And now that I haue said God will witnesse with mee before whome I stand in the sight of men and Angels, that I haue spoken nothing to the touch or preiudice of any contrarie iudgement, or out of the pride or singularitie of my owne heart, but in right and prerogatiue of my Christ, whose

peculiar yet I take it to bee alone, to pardone our sinnes, to pleade our cause, and purchase our place, whither first he is entred in body to make passage for all, and as the Apostle saith: Now to appeareHebr. 9. 24 in the sight of God for vs, and so to conclude with Origen, sicut ex mortuis primogenitus

               christus, it a primus carnem euexit in caelum: As Christ is the first borne of the dead, so hee first caried his flesh into heauen.
            2. A second doubt encountering this Doctrine, riseth from such as make question what became of the bodie of Lazarus after it was raised, as also ofIoh. 11. 44 the bodyes of those saints, which at christ his resurection came out of their graues, went into the holy citty and appeared vntoMath 27: 52 many?
            To which I answere that all was done by myracle, and diuine dispensation onely for that time, to confirme and ascertaine vnto vs the resurection from the dead, as in the head, so in the members. And well it might stand with faith and religion both: that as by like dispensation Christ himselfeMa. 17, 1. 2 being yet mortall, was transfigured vpon

the holy Mount, and glorified in body, and beeing risen againe and gloryfied,10, 20, 27▪

now it ryseth, concluding there upon of two new worldes in, ten thousand yeares: The beastely Epicures were more sottish in their imaginations▪ who dream'd off infinit worldes, one still slitting▪ and another slowing: doubly damned in their thoughts for that they deem'd soules mortall, and worldes immortall, I say of all these as formerlie I haue done with Augustine: Borne they were to beleeue destinye, that their foolish hearts might become beastely.
            But leaue wee these Pagans in their Atheisme, and come wee nearer Christian times, for euen Christians haue been, are, and I feare me, will bee ouer bolde and curious in the search of this secret: for what was it other then presumptiō in the christians of Augustines time, mencioned in his eightenth booke, de ciuit, Dei, who said the world should ende foure hundreth yeares, after the Ascention, others fiue hundreth, others a thousand, But as hee saith, omnes elusit ipsa temporis experientia: Experience played vppon their follies, and latter daies still mocked their former dotage.

               Ierome was not farre from that opinion, & whereof reade Augustine vpon the sixt Psalme, but Stipholius of Wittemberge and Hosiander did mightely defend it.
            I passe by, as too to curious, that vnnecessarye search of Seauens from Adam to Enocke in succession of persons, and from Adam to Elia in succession of ages, wherby they would prooue the seauenth thousand yeare to be the yeare of glorie, when God should come in the cloudes with his

fierie deludge, as Elias went vp in his fierie Charret.
            But of all others who are in the Calender of Christians: our aduersaries (I meane theOur aduersaries dreame of doomes-day by the comming of their Antichrist. Papists) are most foolish in this poynt, who determine of the day of Christ, by the comming of their Antichrist: In discouering of whome, least happily they might discouer their Pope to be the man, driuen they are to many grosse absurdities.
            1. First, that Antichrist should come of the Tribe of Dan: Rhemist 2. Thess. 2. sect. 8 and trowe you, will it bee possible to distinguish of tribes in this so great a confusion of Israel: for if in Ezra his time after the captiuitye, their generatiō was not perfectly knowen, how much more now after so mightye a dispertion in the world of full sixteene hūdred yeares, wil it be impossible to finde out the descent and search the petigree of Dan?
            
            2. Againe, Antichrist (say they) shall haue his Imperiall seate at Ierusalem, & reedifie againe the Temple there. Bell: lib. 3. de Pontific. cap. 13. and this is an absurdity likewise contradicting the truth of Scripture, for Haggai the Prophet calleth the

Temple builded by Zorobabel, the lastHag▪ 2. 10 house.
            3. Thirdly, they holde that he should reigne but three yeares and a halfe, and yet in that space he should fight with the three Kings of Libia, Aegipt, and Ethiopia, and persecute the Christians through the whole world▪ 
               Bell. cap. 16. but this is more grosse, for let any man imagine, how euer it is possible, that in so short a time, Antichrist being but a meere man, should so conquer & subdue the whole world, in which time and space hardly the flightest Ship can sayle it circuite.
            4. But the last, and whereat principally I aime for my purpose, is, that they determine of the verye day of Christ his comming to Judgement, and set it downe to be iust 45. dayes after the death of their Antichrist: Bell: de Rom: Pontifi: Lib: 3. cap. 9.
            Nay, nay my bretheren, had I time, and were it to my Text, easilye might I proue that this their deuice is but a drift to shift from themselues, what they haue, and what they are, I meane Antichrist and Antichristian, for Rome is the place, if Rome be Se
