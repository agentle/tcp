               ❧ To the right Honorable, Charles Howard, Earle of Nottingham, Baron of Effingham, Lord high Admirall of England, of her Maiesties most Honorable priuie Counsayle, and of the Noble Order of the Garter, &c.
            
               RIght Noble Lord, my resolue was aduised, to make immoration vpon the nicest circumstances of your present hauiour, in plentifull and honorable sorrow, whose animall motion might bee admou'd to the violence hereof: This gaue leaue to the greater obseruance which wee owe to the deceased, (that is) in protection and contestation: Besides that warrant of the antentique & Censoriall rites, whose example I haue here quoted for most Honorable Heraldrie, in disposing her funerall torch by due reference, into your suruiuing hand; neither infeebling the courtesie
of the liuing▪ nor promising mine owne aduantage vpon your Noble and innated goodnesse, neither to actuate, & ref

               And as she was, I write for president,
               More of succession, than griefs argument.
            
            
               Your Honours, in all the nerues of my ability, Thomas Powell.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               TO prepare ye to what is writ, I know, my smoothest composure would be too boy sterous, vpon the rigall nakednesse of your impatience. A long preface were a sicke fether vpon your winged Mercury. And yet, to expose me to vninstructed censure, whose proofe is too much in seuerity, I should release the bond of our recōciliation, & seeme to suspect approbation, to be more of fortunes almes, than our owne deseruing. I imply to your freer spirits, all customary requisites, and to my selfe reserue this onely obiter of opinion: That I write more of duty to the dead, than reputation of liuing Poesie. In both which, I am wilfully confident, to be confidently willing.

                  THe Sunne but now began to gather fire,
               And lay a sharper edge vpon his beames,
               Abated to the fulnesse of the yeere,
               As fretted with the salt of Neptunes steames,
               When blacke solemnity enuide anew,
               And soyld his face with a more precious dewe:
            
            
               Dew'd with the most religion of affection,
               Made soft in nature, and in Heraldry:
               The one accusing fate for his election:
               The other, weeping his seuerity.
               Both from their Cyprus altars offring teares,
               Ynowe to make him aged in yong yeares.
            
            
               
               It was not for the gods Arcadian theft,
               When he drew dry their vdders milch-excesse,
               Nor for his mother Pthias, when she wept
               His rage, that earth malign'd his murrinesse.
               But, loe, affections law of like for like:
               It is our natures freedome to requite.
            
            
               For he had lustre on his infant rayes,
               To blandish out the glory of his Spring,
               Reft from the falling Load-starre of our dayes,
               Whose motion was the musike which I sing;
               The measure of consent to all her sphere:
               Indeed she was the best in Cynthia's quiere.
            
            
               
               She was, (and so are loosers still in leesing,
               When they recount the worth of what is lost)
               And is not. Cold remembrance euer freezin

               When it shall reade the story of what's past.
               Yet as she was, repeate for president
               More of succession, then griefs argument.
            
            
               Was of her trayne. Eternities decreeing
               Did dedicate her in her parentage,
               Whose neere alliance askt as neere a beeing,
               And gently seal'd it on her virgin waxe:
               And so, for nature and election,
               Would Cynthia's self endeere her as her own.
            
            
               
               She gaue her ranke, respect, and full accesse,
               Agnizing her affinity and merit
               With fauours, graces after graciousnesse;
               Wherein she seem'd as if she did inherit
               The trust and dignities, which long before
               Her Honourable Ancestors did store.
            
            
               Her parents honours did she extraduce
               Into her very disposition;
               As if the generall Carcy were infusde
               And had no other formes of his diuision.
               Their ancient vnattainted loyalty
               Broad blow'ne, and flush vpon her infancy.
            
            
               
               Yet beauty was not onely of her blood:
               Her birth-day Solstice height vnto perfection.
               The Cantharis enuies a verdant bud,
               And birth does only counsaile to prosection.
               So learnd she with the chāge of euery spring,
               To saue her blood with heedfull dyeting.
            
            
               Her youth preseru'd it chaste with continence;
               A virgin diet for the hote intention,
               Which might vnglosse his colour: adde expēce,
               Both of the length & bredth of their dimēsion,
               But the example of her mariage bed,
               Were Oratory to perswade to wed.
            
            
               
               For after she had blest so many moones,
               As had Astrea, when she was transfixt;
               With more austerity, than that which crownes
               The Romane chastity, did she commixe
               Her birth, her blood, Nobility and name,
               To flowe more lofty in as rich veyne:
            
            
               In Howards ample veynes; a Family
               Of eminence, deryu'd without distent,
               From the first shield of all their Auncestry,
               To this of Charles, the latest Eminent:
               Whose fayth and fortunes may they ne're expire,
               But in a melting firmament of fire.
            
            
               
               She wedded, yet she was a Votary,
               To minister-in consecrated flame,
               And weare Dianaes bow vpon her thigh,
               Till on a day of sanctified name,
               To store eche Nymph with shafts, the goddesse bids,
               To fill her quiuers all with Poplar twigs,
            
            
               That grew vpon a leuin, which the sea
               Had season'd thriftily within the shore:
               There Neptune fell in loue with 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
               
               That till this day ne're sawe the Nymph before,
               Ne're had his brest improou'd or softened,
               But like the temper of his Corall bed:
            
            
               
               From which he lately risse to lay her in,
               And plac'd his Aggot wreath vpon her browes,
               Whose potent charmes Diana pardon'd him,
               And gaue her back the freedome of her vowes;
               So she might still be of her fayrie trayne,
               He war with Saturnes sonnes vpon the mayne.
            
            
               And now, Eliza, with her wedlocke fate,
               Did wed her to a higher dignity.
               She kept the chayre that did suborne her state,
               And grac'd it like the blue-eyde Cassiope:
               She ne're surcharg'd ability with grace,
               But still her owne dimensions fild the place:
            
            
               
               Wherein this noble Lady Katherine seemd
               T'anticipate her Mistris bounteous hand,
               As if her offices were but redeemd
               From vnder meriting, and she did stand
               Alone, and vnencountred in her worth;
               One whom inheritance had called forth;
            
            
               Or rather prouidence: for what she was,
               She was to others, through her selfe intended:
               Like to some interiected leafe of glasse,
               That breaks, yet heats, when neerer rayes offended.
               She was all Organs, euen to the mind,
               Whereby God did insinuate with mankind.
            
            
               
               Her whole mortality had this extent.
               She had affections of immortall sense:
               For she would pity much, and much relent:
               But the affect of greatest presidence
               Ouer her nature, held no sinne to this;
               To leaue apt good vndone, or doo't amisse.
            
            
               The more they misse of her that are imbayd,
               And fortune fixt for want of sea and scope,
               Their burden with their sayle being ouerlayd:
               Vnlesse they Anchor all their after-hope,
               They misse: alas, I write of that too soone,
               And lend her liuing-worth for griefe to come.
            
            
               
               Yet liu'd she to outliue that old report,
               Which now againe our new worlds formes approue:
               That, there is no retiremēt in the court,
               Where there is much variety to moue,
               And steale away. O, there's no life like hers,
               That liu'd to bury her executers.
            
            
               For softnesse neuer seyz'd her appetite.
               A bloodlesse lyuor liues not on his heat:
               Her resolution was Pr

               No change, no liberty, no ful-eyde pleasure
               Could bring deuotions musike out of measure.
            
            
               
               It was for her, the million of her sexe,
               And calling, doe beside approue their kind;
               Whose story often read, as oft begets
               Opinion, that the sexe is so inclin'd,
               And calling, so disposed vnto good,
               As well in Courtship, as in woman-hood.
            
            
               She was a woman; yet, not one of those
               Whose erogated heate conuerts to hate.
               It was her honour to forgiue her foes,
               Euen in their ebbe, and full distent of state.
               Alas, she would not take aduantage than,
               Lest she should trip the fraylty of his man.
            
            
               
               She would not glory his humility,
               Nor actuate her old aggreeuances
               O're weake distresse, and present misery:
               Such conquest! O, tis base and honourlesse.
               For when I doe but second Fortunes stroke,
               I wound a heart that is already broke.
            
            
               She was a Courtier too; but as a Starre

               Moou'd on no other line, but Cynthia's beame:
               Her freer spirit ne're was put in frame,
               Though she put on her self a Courtiers name.
            
            
               
               For she did hospitable bounty too,
               And euer kept her influence at home;
               Which euery Courtier vses not to doe,
               Why, she was nothing Courtier, nor her owne:
               Her light was made a Sea-marke to distresse,
               Where Fortunes wracks arryu'd their needines.
            
            
               In Court, no study that would apprehend,
               Or aske Religion of her duty more,
               Than, what Eliza gaue, might still commend
               Her most magnificence, and fountayne store:
               She was not like a Conduit-pipe fast by,
               To turne the streame, & leaue the channel dry.
            
            
               
               How many seruants of that Royall trayne
               Could the fresh image of her loue excite,
               To witnesse, she preferd Elizaes fame
               Aboue her priuate reputations height!
               She hated to be hyr'de to doe them good,
               Or begd to buy their merits, though she cou'd.
            
            
               And yet did her contentment stretch it selfe
               More amply: Greatnesse was aboue her feare;
               A faith beyond the curse that followes wealth,
               Who euermore suspects eruptions neere,
               Whose chāge does chāge the state of their subiectiō,
               And giues this duty to the next electiō.
            
            
               
               Great & secure! Me thinks, tis wōdrous strange:
               But gracious not enuyde! Impossible:
               For discontent makes worth his Fret of change,
               And not seruility it selfe speakes well
               Of Honourable birth or betterment:
               Respect, with him is feare; & feare, contempt.
            
            
               I know not how respect came ouer all;
               But the most humble did admire her most:
               A branch of ranke loue turnd to prodigall:
               Such loue is still exhaust, or ouerflowes.
               Ile learne ye how she did diuert their hate:
               She made her selfe as humble as their state.
            
            
               
               The lyst of all her vertues had a name
               Of greater reuerence, than had the rest.
               Religion. Tis a sessions to arraigne,
               Detect, and bring our actions to the test.
               And where that list was stack, remisse, & loose,
               Assure ye, it was frailty extraduc'de.
            
            
               She had no other principles (God wot)
               Whereby to leuell and conforme her life:
               All was not honest that was safely got:
               She would not by iniustice compasse right;

               Her life was but a modell imitation,

               In holy writ, which gaue it approbation;
               They were her essence (therfore could not fade)
               Like colour layd in wine: her Lenten blacke
               Did sit, like Nessus shirt vpon her backe.
            
            
               At this perfection and maturity,
               She stood in natures frayle adoption heere,
               When heauen would vouchsafe her first to be
               A mother, and her vertues to appeare
               In propagated noblesse of a sonne,
               That layd his roote as far as she begunne.
            
            
               
               That first, L. William was of Effingham,
               
               A Barony, that field and Knighthood earnd
               With sweating spurs, when heraldry deraignd
               His hardiment. O, 'twere a sight to learne,
               And put ambitious fire in any Swayne,
               To see Nobility so dearely gaynd.
            
            
               Heauen was delighted in his workmanship,
               And now became more boūtious of his breath,
               Which sweld her womb to be more fruitful yet,
               Deriu'd a second labors where she left,
               A second blessing, and a Charles beside;
               For Honours lofty bed did open wide.
            
            
               
               A third. Inuention, giue me backe, my selfe
               Deuided. All my numbers keepe consent,
               And with my soule my stiles ambition melt.
               Eche sinew of our duty be attent;
               Forget the funerall state and maiesty,
               And prostitution wholly summon me.
            
            
               Call her by any epithite exprest
               In vertues Inuentory; nay discourse
               Her mothers life: see with what liuelinesse
               She does insert it, freely, and vnforc'd.
               Be she the noble Countesse of Kildare,
               
               Or Cobhams Baronesse; shee's wondrous faire.

               Nature, and grace, and stars their rest had set,
