               With oathes confirm'd betweene each Prince,
               to be performed indeed.
               The which conditions of the peace,
               in order follow heere:
               Whereby the cause of all those broyles,
               to all men may appeare.
            
            
               First that the King of Sweden should,
               The City Calman yeald:
               Into the King of Denmarkes hands,
               (e're further blood be spil'd.)
               UUith all the profits of the same▪
               
               If he the same would hold
               Or else to his commodity,
               The Citty must be sold.
            
            
               That Elsbach, Otland, two great townes,
               and Mensborch, with the land:
               And Forces must be all deliuer'd,
               to mighty Denmarks hand.
               For twelue yeares space he must inioy,
               Those Castles Townes and Forts,
               And now in rest these Princes great,
               do florish in their Courts.

               That Layland euer shall be free,
               without all contribution:
               That Greeneland is the Danish Kings,
               and giue no restitution.
               That Denmarks King without all let,
               foure golden Crownes may beare,
               Which was the great and greatest cause,
               he first these warres did reare.
            
            
               Besides some things of smaller note,
               betwixt them is decreed:
               And so those mighty Christian Kings,
               like brothers are agreed.
               Thus after many bloody fights,
               and many people slaine:
               The deadly stroake of dangerous armes,
               brings blessed peace againe.
