                  QVINTVS
Curcius,
ye famous
wryter of
the greate
Battayles
that Kyng
Alexāder,
the ſōne of
Phillippe of Macedone, had againſt
the mooſt noble, and ritch
Kyng of the Medes and Perſians,
called Darius (ryght worſhipfull
ſir) declareth that when
one Philippe the Phiſicion vnto

the ſayde Kyng Alexander, and
his moſte truſty ſubiecte. By ſodayne
chaunce, the kyng fell ſore
ſicke, to the great heauines of all
his royall armie, at whiche tyme
with al ſpeade, this phiſicion did
prepare a medicine, moſte excellente
for his ſoueraine Lorde,
whome he ſo dearly loued, to this
ende, that the great vertue therof
might preuent his preſent ſickenes,
& imenint daūger: but malicious
ſpite, that wretched enemie
whiche neuer ſlepeth but watcheth
euer, to bringe vertue and
good fame to deſtructiō
               
                  •
                Immediatly
before this gentle Philip
did preſente him ſelfe vnto the
kyng with his medicine: Letters
were ſent to king Alexander cō
               teining,
that the ſaid Philip wa
                  •
               
corrupted ſo with money from
king Darius, that he hadde 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
moſte deadly poyſon and vncurable
venyme into Alexanders
medicine. The king peruſing the
letters, kept theim ſecrete vntyll
he had dronke his medicine, and
immediatly he toke his phiſicion
by the hande, and deliuered hym
the letters, that he might rede thē
hauing in him ſo great cōfidence,
that he did in no maner of caſe
miſtruſte him. The cauſe why I
haue alledged this moſt worthy
prince kyng Alexāder, & his excellent
phiſiciō Philip, is to declare
the great truſte in the one, & the
fidelitie in the other, not forgetting
the ſhameles condicions of
the flattryng Pariſites, whiche
euer wrlketh with two faces in
one hood, bearing fier in the one
hande, and water in the other: ſowers
of diſcorde, reapers of miſchief:
which be alwaies enemies

vnto the diſciples of Philippe,
whoſe venemous ſtynges can
not hurte them, which euer haue
in ſtore the precious Iewel of pacience,
and arme them ſelues to
do good to euerye good man, for
the preſeruation of their lyues,
by the trewe rules of the gouerment
of health, whiche here I
am ſo bold to preſent vnto your
worſhip. For where as there lacketh
gouernement in a common
wealth, the people dooe eftſones
fall into ruyne. The ſhippes that
lacketh good gouernaunce, oftē
               times
be caſt awaie vpon ſandes
and rockes. And therefore there
is nothinge vnder heauen, that
hath lyfe, but if it lacke good gouernemēt
it wil quickly fal into
vtter decaie. For like as the creature
of all thinges, haue formed
the bodies of al mē into the goodlieſt

ſhapes of euery liuing thing
that euer was, or euer ſhalbe:
Euē ſo he hath ordeined for mā:
herbes, frutes, rootes, ſeedes,
plantes, gūmes, oyles, precious
ſtones, beaſts, foules, fiſhes, for
the preſeruation of health, to be
moderatly vſed with diſcretion,
whiche preſerueth the bodye in
good eſtate, without whoſe vertues
the bodies can not lyue, for
they be the noryſhers of life. But
miſuſing or abuſing them, bringeth
to the body many diſeaſes,
as rumes, catores, dropſies, impoſtumes,
gowtes, flixes, opelations,
vertigos, blyndnes, ruptures,
franſies, with many moonoyſome
diſeaſes, which cometh
thorowe the corruptiō of meates
and ill aire. For what auaileth
ryches, honoures, coſtly buyldinges,
faire apparell, with all

the pompe of this worlde, and to
be honoured of the people, and in
the meane time to be eaten with
wormes in the breaſte or in the
belly, conſumed with agues, turmented
with gowtes, ſorenes,
boneache. &c. Well I thinke, an
hole Codrus is better than a ſicke
Mydas.
               Codrus. Midas. And ſeing that to poſſeſſe
health is better then to gouerne
golde, in ſo much that health maketh
men more happier, ſtronger
and quieter then all maner of riches,
lacking health: as exāple.
Great princes, noble mē, men of
great ſubſtaunce, when they bee
wrapped & encloſed with many &
ſundry ſickeneſſes, and in dailye
daungers of death, in their extreme
paynes and paſſions, they
do more greatly coueit one drope
of health then a whole tunne of
gold, criyng out for the helpe and

counſeile of the phiſicion. Whom
Ieſus Sirack,
               Cap. 38. in his godlie boke did
counſell allwyſe men to honour,
and whome the almghtie God,
did create and ordeine for the infirmitie
of mankinde, and alſo
medicine for his helpe, and that
no wyſe man ſhould deſpiſe thē.
Therfore yet againe (right worthie
Knight) I ſhall moſte humbly
deſire you, to except the good
will of him, whiche wyſſheth the
yeares of your proſperous lyfe &
health,Neſtor. Galen. Argantō. to be equall to Neſtor, Arganton,
and Galen. Whoſe lyues
were long, healthful and happy.
And thus wyſhing the daily encreaſe
of your worſhip, with continuall
health, to gods pleaſure:
who euer be your guide and gouernour,
Amen. Your worſhips
alwaies to commaunde.

               Though bākettes doth abounde, eyes for to pleaſe,
               Ouercharging the ſtomake, bringeth ſmall eaſe.
            
            
               THe aboundaunce of wine, and luſte of meate,
               Feaſting in the daie, and riot in the night,
               Inflameth the bodie with vnnaturall heate.
               Corrupteth the bloud, and abateth the ſight,

               O Happy is pouertie, with good gouernaunce,
               Whiche of fine fode hath no great plentie,
               Nature is ſuffiſed, with thinges ſuffiſaunce
               But poyſoned, with floodes of ſuperfluitie,

               Example to Diogmes, ſitting in his tonne,
               Was well pleaſed, with reflexcion of the ſunne.
            
            
               BEaſtes and foules, of nature rauenous,
               Infieldes and foreſtes, ſeke their aduenture,
               Vpon their praies deuouring moſte odious,
               Conſuming by glottonie, many a creature,
               Yet eche of theim, according to their nature.
               Can purge their Cruditie, with caſting venomous
               Man through replecion, is in daunger parelous.
            
            
               
               Mans nature doth wekē, as this world doth waſt
               As thinges ingendred, corrupting by time,
               Your lyfe is preſent, but death maketh haſte,
               Feſtinate by ſurfite, I tell you in ryme,
               Example to the epicures, rotten into ſlime,
               As gods worde and ſtoris, the treuth to tell,
               That vnſatiat glottons ſhall faſte in hell.
            
            
               TRuly to wyſe men, this is the chief medicine,
               Moderate diet, with temperat trauell,
               good ayr in ſwete fields, whē ye ſon doth ſhine,
               Fliyng ſtinging miſtes, that the life will expell,

to be noted in phiſicke,Gallen de elemen. de temp. de facul. as. v.
principall partes, as Gallen ſaith:
in lib. de Elementis. The firſt is to
conſider the nature of mans bodie.Phiſicke deuided into fyue partes.
The ſeconde is, to kepe the
bodie in health, and to defende it
from ſickenes and infirmities.
The thirde is, to knowe all the
cauſes, rules, and ſedes, wherof
the ſicknes doth growe. The .iiii
is Criſes or iudgemēt of the diſeaſe
of thinges preſent, paſt & to
come. The fifth is the beſte and
moſte excellēt, for it ſheweth the
maner of healing, dietinge, faſſhion,
order, & waye to helpe the

ſicke bodie, & preſerue the ſame,
as longe as man doth remayne

is, by thoſe things wherof ye bodie
is cōpact, cōſtituted or made,
as Gallen ſaith: in his .iii. boke of
his Tēpramentis. Cap. 4. The ſecōd
is called not natural, as meates
or thinges to preſerue the bodie
in health, they be not called vnnaturall,
becauſe they be againſte

               THere are alſo other diſcirptions
of the foure humors,
very neceſſary to be knowē, and
their places where as they dwel
within the body, & firſt of bloud,
as Galen ſaieth: in his firſt booke
of effected places, bloude (ſaieth
he) that is in the pulſis, doeth
greatly differ from the bloude of
the vaynes, for the bloude of the
pulſis is thinner, yeallower and
hotter, and this bloud, maye bee
called the gouernour of life. The
ſpring & fountayne of the bloud
generall is in the lyuer,

this bloud in culler is very read.

in the ſtomake, and at lēgth
by the vertue of naturall heate,

There be alſo watry, ſlimy glaſſy,
groſſe, ſalte, ſower, thicke,
harde, binding, and extreme cold
fleames, whiche in dede be vnnaturall,
that bee engendred thorowe
ſurphets, coldnes or idelnes,
bringing to the bodie many
noiſome diſeaſes. There is alſo
coller, whiche is yellowe, whoſe
place in the body is ye gall, which
commeth of the clenſing or puryfying
of bloud: and this coller is
cleare, hote and drie, and the cō
                  forter
of decoction. Grene coller,
or coller myngled with fleame,
be vnnaturall, melancoly naturall,
in the ſplene is nothing but
the ſex degrees, or heauie reſidentes
of the bloud, the naturall
melācoly is knowen by his blacknes,
the vnnatural cometh of the
burning of coller, and is lighter

& hoter, browne of couler, ſower
of taſte, and putteth the bodie in
great daūger: as madnes, blacke
gaunders, continual feuers, and
ſodaine deadly diſeaſes. Therefore

               THere is to bee conſidered in
eating and drinking,A conſideration to he had in eatinge & drinking the time
of hunger or cuſtome, the place
of eatynge and drinkinge, wheit
be colde or hoote, alſo the time
of the yeare, whether it be Wynter
or Sommer: Alſo the age or
complexion of the eater, and whether
he be hoole or ſicke: alſo the
thinges which be eaten, whether
they be fiſhe or fleſhe, frutes or
herbes. Note alſo the cōplexions
and tempramentes of the ſayde

meates, hoote or colde, drie or
moiſt, and moſte chiefly, marke
the quantitie & ſo furth. And like
as lampes doth cōſume the oyle,
whiche is put vnto them, for the
preſeruaciō of the light, although
it cannot continue for euer: ſo is
the naturall heate which is with
in vs preſerued by humiditie &
moiſtnes of bloude and fleame,
whoſe chiefe engenderer be good
meates and drinkes. As Auicen
ſaieth deethica. When naturall
heat is quēched in ye body, thē of
neceſſitie, the ſoule muſt departe
from the body. For the worckeman
can not worke when his inſtrumente
is gone.A cauſe why the ſoule departeth from the body. So the ſpirites
of life, can haue no exerciſe
in the body when there is no natural
heate to worke vpon. Without
meate ſaieth Galen: it is not
poſſible for any mā to liue, either

whole or ſicke, and thus to conclude,
no vital thing liueth with
out refection and ſuſtenaunce,
whether it be animall reaſonable,
or animale ſenſible, without
reaſon or any vital thing in ſenſible,
both man, beaſt fiſſhe, and
worme, tree, or herbe. All theſe
thinges be newtrified with the

foure Elementes or any of thē.

ſaythe in his boke De ethimia the

meates whyche be withoute all
blame, be thoſe whiche be betwene
ſubtyll and groſe. Good
bread of clene wheate, fleſhe of
capons or hēnes, pheſantes and
patriches, pigions, and turtill
doues, black birdes, and ſmall
fielde birdes, roſted veale, or
boyled motton:What kindes of meates dothe cauſe good bloud. Theſe dooe engender
good bloude ſayth Galen.
Note alſo that any other meate
that thou doeſt eate at ſupper, although
it ſeme repugnant to aflegmatike
ſtomack, if thou ſlepe
well after it, and fele no payne,
thou mayeſte vſe it as a meate
neceſſary. And when thou canſte
not ſlepe wel, if the defaute came
through meate, marke yt meate
or drinke, althoughe it appere
pleſāt, refuſe it as an enemi. And
wheras thou haſt vſed euil diete
as a cuſtome in abuſinge time,

quantitie & qualitie, be litle, and
litle, bring thy ſelf into good order
& to time, bothe for thy brekfaſtes,
dinner and ſupper. Prouided
alwaye to eate good thinges,
but not many thinges. For
like as repletiō or aboūdaūce of
meate is an enemy vnto the bodie,
and the ſoule, and bringeth
ſodayne death:What hurt commeth of an emty ſtomacke when ye go to bed euen ſo is emptines
a ſhorter of time, aweker of

Galen ſaythe in his diatory,Galen me trite.

the natures of men, of waters, of

generally, particulerly to thy ſelf,
being a natural Engliſh man of

counſail in his regimēt of helth,
ſaiyng: a good aire which is pure
and holſome is that, whiche is
not troubled in ſtanding waters,

and chaufer of the heate natural,
whiche chaſſeth away ſlepe,What profit cō

health, if we wil kepe ꝑfit health,

We muſte begin of laborrs and
moderat trauell and then to our
meate and drinke, and ſo for the

haukers, ſhooters, hunters, and
plowmen, and gardeners, &c.
haue ſo good dyſgeſtyon and

greate ſtones, not onely in

take meruelous traueles in age
which to Idle people ſemeth verye
paynefull,Vſe meketh labour eſy. but vnto them
ſelues that trauell no paine but

Theſe people can diſgeſte groſe

hetherto I am ſkant recouered of

was geuen me, that I ſhould not ſtaye
my ſelfe vpon the opinion of any one
phiſicion, but rather vpon three, then
ſayd I: to retayne thre at once, requiquireth
great charge, for thoſe men to
whome lyues be committed, ought liberall
rewardes to be geuen. Then
ſayd my frende, they are good gentlemen

and no great takers. What bee
their names ſaid I? he aunſwered ſaiyng:
The firſt was called doctor diet,Diet. Quiet. Meximā
                  
the ſeconde doctor quiet, the thirde doctor
mery mā. I did wryte their names,
but yet I could not ſpeake with them.
            
            
               ¶ Humfrey.
               HEtherunto I haue ſayd ſomthing
that ſhall well ſuffice
for the to knowe doctor diat, as
for quiet, and mery man, they lie
in no phiſicions handes, to giue,
but onlye in Goddes.It were better to lacke ryches, thē to wante quietnes & mirth. For ſmall
it helpeth to any man, to haue honour,
riches, fame, conning. &c.
And in the meane time, to wante
quietnes, and mirth, whiche bee
the chief frendes. Tendriſt nuryſhes,
holſomeſt phiſiciōs, moſte
pleſaunt muſicions, & friendlieſt
cōpanions, to nature, pleaſaunt
birdes ſinging in the branches,
be more happier then rauening

Cormerantes, and gready haukes,
whiche with paines inchaſeth
their prais. The quiet lābes
be euer happier in their kynde,
then ye gredy rauining foxes, wolues
and lions,Many apt ſimilitudes or mettophers. which neuer ceſe,
vexing them ſelues, to kil liuing
things for their fode. The poore
oyſter, lurking vnder the rock, or
ſande, whiche is neuer remoued
of ſtronge ebbes nor fluddes, is
farder from trauell & continuall
paynes, then the horrible whale,
moſt feareful to fiſhes. The low
ſhrubs, or buſhes growyng nere
to the ground, be euer in more ſauegarde
then the luſty highe floriſhyng
trees, ſpred with pleaſāt
braunches, whiche be ſubiect to
euery ſtrong wynde. The poore
bootes in harbor, be in leſſe peryl
then the fikle riche ſhips, toſſed
vp & downe on the cruel fluddes.

What ſhal I ſay: but this, that ye
miſerable ragged begger called
Irus, was more happier in his
pouertie with quietnes & mirth,
then was the glotonus beaſte, &
mōſterous man king Sardanapalꝰ,
with all his goldē glory court of
ruffians, & Curticens with Cam to
an end moſte ſhamefull. Diogenes,
I warrant you was not inferor

and haue left as great a fame
behind him, ſauing that Alexāder,
was a more cruel murderer then
Diogenes a chaſt liuer.The pleaſure of poore mē. In dede ye

no ſodaine miſhappe. The great

it is holeſome to be dronk before
meat, for it pearſeth quickely to
the bladder: but if it be dronke vpon
a full ſtomacke, it wil rather
make opilation and ſtoppynge of
the meſerates, becauſe it dothe
ſwiftlye driue fode doune, before
nature hath of hym ſelf diſgeſted
it. And ye nature of white Wyne
is of leaſt warmeneſſe. The ſeconde
Wyne is pure Claret, of
a clere Iacinct, or yelow colour.
This wine doth greatly nourryſhe
and warme the body, and is a
holſome wyne with meate, and
is good for flegmatike folke, but
very vnholſome for younge children,
or them whiche haue hoate
liuers, or paines in their heade,
occaſioned of hoate vapours, or
ſmokes, for it is like vnto fier, &
flaxe. The thirde is blacke, or

deepe read wyne, which is thick,
a ſtopper of the belly, a corrupter
of the bloud, a breader of ye ſtone,
hurtfull to olde men, and profitable
to fewe menne, except they
haue the flixe. And for the election
of wyne ſaieth Auicen: that
wine is beſt that is betwene new

note this, that in driyeres, wines

               ALe doth engendre groſe humors
in the body, but if it be
made of good barly malte, and of
holſome water, and verye well
ſodden, and ſtande fyue or ſyxe
daies, vntyll it bee cleare. It is
verye holſome, eſpeciallye for
hoate chollerycke folkes, hauing
hoate burning feuers. But if ale
be very ſwete and not well ſoddē
in the brewing, it bringe thin flamation
of wind and choller in to
the belly: If it bee very ſower, it
fretteth and nepeth the guttes, &
is euil for the eies. To them that
be very flegmaticke, ale is very
groſe, but to temperat bodies it

encreaſeth bloude: It is partely
laxatiue, and prouoketh vrine.
Cleane brewed Beare if it be not
very ſtrong, brewed with good
hoppes, doeth clenſe the body frō
corruption, & is very holſom for
the liuer, it is an vſual or cōmon
drinke in moſte places of Englande,
whiche in deade is hurt &
made worſe with many rotten
hoppes, or hoppes dried like duſt
whiche commeth from beyonde
the ſea. But although there commeth
manye good hoppes from
thence, yet it is knowen that the
goodly ſtilles, & fruteful groūds
of englād, do bring furth to mās

in any place of this worlde, as by
profe I know in many places of
the countrey of Suffolke: Where
as they brewe their beare with
the hoppes that groweth vppon

their owne groundes: And thus
to conclude of ale and beere, they
haue no ſuche vertue nor goodnes

whiche be taken of them,

becauſe I haue had no cōferrence with
