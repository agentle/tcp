               TO auoyde the faulte of Ingratitude, amōgst the olde Philosophers beeyng accompted one of the gretest: I thoght it good (ryght Honourable) to dedicate this Boke vnto you, as a token or argument

of my good will: rather remembring, thā requiting your boūtifull curtesie. The which Boke was written aboue three hūdred and threscore yeeres past, entituled The miserie of man. The contentes whereof, if with deep and due iudgement we doe consider, we shall easily finde greate cause to make a rechlesse accoūt of al worldly pomp & vanitie: & that for great cause: For our life in hir firste entrie into this

world, is encoūtred with thre capital enimies, paine, care, and sorow: Payne bids the body battayle, care continueth the skirmish, and sorowe giueth the victorie. It is a greeuous thing to behold our 
                  •
               irst entertainement so displeasantly entreated: wee lamente in the firste minute, and rewe to the laste moment. No sooner born but straight bounde hande and foote, and cast into the cradle as into a prison, wher we

lie long time fast fettered in the feeblenesse of our owne flesh. Then enter we into the warres that holy Iob speaketh of, where he sayth: The life of man is but warfare. For there is no part of mans age that he passeth ouer, in the whiche he hath not some combate to fight. The firste conflict which we are to endure, is infancy, in the which time wee labour with the lacke of reason, and fighte with our own folly, not knowing

where we are, ne what wee are, ne whence, nor for what we come. Thē after a time, we haue to striue with our hands and feete, vsing them to learne their duties. And in this conflicte wee doe continue vntil the age of seuen yeres, al the whiche time we are feble, weak, & without iudgemēt or reason, not able to help ourselues. These yeeres ouerpassed, we warre vnder the fear of the rod, in spending time to learne some

liberall science, or else some other machanical arte, wherby we may either aspire to some high estate, or else procure our necessary sustenāce In the third part of our age, we enter into a most perilous skirmishe, fighting againste the desires of the fleshe, againste fonde affections and vaine imaginations, whiche causeth the minde to be vnconstāt, and to be caryed away with sundry fancies. Fourthly, we haue to encoū
               ter

with manhoode. In this warfare, we beare some coū
               tenance in the cōmon welth, ambitiouslye seeking after honor and estimation, and couetously affecting wealthe and riches. To this age is incidēt the charge of wife and children, the maintenaunce of our family, & care of posteritie. After all these foloweth the mayne battayle which neuer taketh peace with vs, vntil our dying day. In this field we receiue many

wounds which neuer can bee cured: as bleared eyes, trēbling hands, gowty feete, deaf eares, wrinkled brows, leane cheeks, lothsom breth, baldnesse, corruption of stomacke, with many moe miseries infinite, whiche neuer rest to vāquish the body with furious assalts, ne to disquiet the minde with troublesome thoughts, & to wound the conscience with the remembrance of things past. And furthermore, suche is

the vnhappy lot of life, that all those things whiche wee most greedily desire, as honor, riches
                  •
                & plesures, wee leaue them again speedily, and in our greatest dangers they do vs no good. Therfore the wise Philosopher, being demāded what was the gretest thing in the world? aunswered, it was the valiaunte heart of a man, that coulde cōtemne and lightly esteme the high & mighty things of the world. For honor and

dignitie hath no assurance, and in Fortunes fauoure is no stabilitie. Philip king of Macedone obteined in one day three notable victories: After the which he is sayd to haue kneeled downe vpon the grounde, holding vp his handes vnto the Heauens, crying out in this wise: O Lady Fortune most vncertayne, O my happie destenies, I humbly beseech you, that after this greate honor and glory, whiche you nowe

haue giuen mee, you woulde moderate and temper the troubles & afflictiōs which in time to come you will lay vpon mee. For commonly, gret prosperitie is a messenger to greeuous calamitie, & nothing in this life is certayn or sure. As Socrates affirmed when he sayd, that the certaynest thing in this worlde was, that all things were vncertaine. It is written, that diuers Captaynes came vnto Agesilaus, and

requested hym to walke vp vnto the hill called Olympus, where (saide they) you shal see great wealthy merchantes vttering a world of riches and pretious Iewels. His aunswere was this, if I coulde buy or sell, yea or exchāge their sorow for mirth, sicknesse for helthe, deathe for life: I would thē goe thither and spende all that I haue: but I see (quoth he) that the biers & sellers, yea and the very things themselues

are condemned to die and to perishe. Wherefore neither the sight of any thīg, nor the obtayning of anye thing there, can better mine estate, or help me at the hour of death, whē I must creepe into my graue. For although honor, wealthe, and riches, beare great rule amōgst mē, yet they preuaile not against death. To verefie the same, I could wishe (right Honorable) other testimonie,
                  The Ladie Compton.
                thā the lamentable funerals of your

louing daughter lately deceassed: of whome I wil forbeare to speake much, least the greene memory may rufully renew your forepassed sorowes. In whome, whiles she was, what might be wished that she wanted? Shee was indued with all excellēt gifts, as beautie, vertue, and fortune: Hir vertues were passing, and made hir comparable with any of hir equals: Hir beautie was singular, and made hir most amiable.

What greater fortune, than to be nobly borne and to liue in honor? Shee feared God, shee loued hir Prince, she h
                  •
               ted vice, and followed vertue: sh
                  •
               e pitied the miserie of the afflicted, she releeued the necessitie of those that wanted: she was the daughter of true nobilitie, the mirror 
                  •
               f al curtesie, the mistresse of al modestie. To be short, she did well and dyed well. Yet neyther noblenesse of birth, nor yet the gifts of nature or Fortune,

could keepe hir with vs: whē death would haue hir. Thus you may see, howe lothsome our life is, and howe vncertayne the transitorie things of this world are. I hold him therefore most wisest, that so liueth as though he shoulde always die. There came one vnto Diogenes & sayd: O what a miserable thing it is to liue in this worlde: vnto whom he answered: my frēd you are deceiued, for it is no misery for a man to liue, but it is a miserable thing for a

mā to liue euill. Whose answer we shall find most true
                  •
                when wee shall bee called to make an account of our bayliwikes. For we haue heere no cōtinuall, mansion place: beeing made or created of two natures, wherof the one is mortall, and ruleth heere for a time, where fleshe and bloud bereth the sway: The other is celestial, which giueth feeling, vnderstāding, & iudgemēt vnto the erthly or mortall substāce: of the whiche if it be vndefiled in

this life, they both shal inhabite the place of perpetuall blisse, they shal receyue heauēly giftes and vertues, they shal accō

Truely I may well crye out, woe is mee: and with moste lamentable voyce may say, O mother why hast thou brought me forth the chylde of bitternesse and sorow? why did I not ende my dayes in my mothers wombe?
                        Iob. 3.
                      wherefore did I not perishe

as soone as I came into the worlde? whye was I receyued in my mothers lappe, fedde and nourished with hir pappes
                        •
                      being borne to destruction, and to bee the foode of fyre? would to God the place of my creation had bin my graue, and the house of my euerlasting conception: For thē I shuld haue bin as though I had not bin at all, transferred from byrth to buriall. Who wil therfore giue a fountain of teares vnto mine eyes, that I may bewayle the miserable entrie or comming of man into thys world? the faultie and guiltie proceeding of man in this his conuersation? and the damnable or dangerous departure of the soule of man from the bodye? I will therefore with teares consider and declare whereof man is made, what his doings are, and what perhappes shall become of him after this lyfe. Truelye man is made of earthe, conceyued in sinne, and borne to payne. Hee doeth commit in this lyfe, wicked and shrewde turnes which bee not lawfull: foule and vncleane actes which bee not decent: and vayne things which are not expedient. Through his wickednesse hee shall become food to ye fire, meat for worms,

and a lumpe of putrifaction lothsome to behold. I will expound it more plainly. Man is made of dust, of clay, of ashes: he is cōceiued in the wanton desire of fleshly luste, in the heate of carnall appetyte, in the foule delight of leacherye, and which is worse, in the spotte of sinne. Hee is borne a ser

                     or the most part daungerous,The doinges of man. whereby bee eyther offendeth God, hurteth his neighbours, or impayreth him selfe. Hee practiseth vnseemely and vnhonest things, whereby hee procureth infamye, defileth his conscience, and dishonesteth him selfe. Hee occupyeth him selfe in vayne thynges, whereby hee doth neglecte matters of importaunce: hee doeth despyse things which bee for his profitte, and nothyng regardeth things which be
                        •
                      necessarye. Hee shall become chaffe to the fyre which alwayes doeth burne vnquenchably:What shal become of man. Hee shall bee meate for the worme which alwayes doeth gnawe and deuour: and in fyne, he shall be an immortall masse of putrifaction, heaped full of horror and lothsomenesse.

                  GOD hath made man of the slyme of the earth, which is more base than bee the other Elements, as it doth appeare by the second Chapter of Genesis. For he made the Planettes and starres, of the fi

                        Gen. 2.
                      but man and beasts he did forme of the earth. Therefore if man doe consider those thinges which bee made of water, hee shall finde his substance vyle and base: if hee haue respecte to those liuing thinges which are created of the ayre, hee shall acknowledge him selfe to be much inferior: and if hee looke vppon those creatures which bee made of fyre, hee shall ius

                      For wee euidently see the death of men and beastes is all one, the condition of them both is equal, and man can doe no more than the beaste in

this respecte: they be made of earth, and they doe both returne agayne into earth. These be the wordes of the wyse King Salomon. Wherefore to conclude, what other thing is man, but clay and ashes? Here

                  The corruption of mans Conception. Chap. 3.
                  THou mayest perhappes refute these former reasons after this superficiall sort,

saying, that Adam was made of the slime of the ea

True it is thou sayest: but yet was Adam made of a pure and maydenlye earth, and thou art created of an vncleane and corrtupte seede.Man is made of vncleane seede. And who can make him cleane which is conceyued of an ad
                     
                        •
                     ltred and defiled seede?
                        Iob. 14.
                      or what is man that hee should seeme pure and vndefiled, and that beyng borne of a woman he shuld appeare iuste? For beholde (sayeth the Prophet Dauid) I am conceyued in wickednesse,
                        Psal. 50.
                      and my mother hath brought me forth in sinne: Not in one sinne onely, nor in one kynde of offence, but in a multitude of iniquities: That is to saye, in the iniquityes and sinnes of others. For Conception is of two sortes.Cenception of two sortes. The one is of 
                        •
                     eedes: and the other of natures. The former conception is to bee vnderstanded, in offences personally committed: the seconde is, in offences contracted or taken by others. The parentes doe commit offence in the former conception: and the children doe incurre offence in the seconde. For who knoweth not y• carnal knowledge (although it be in mariage) cā not he had wt out ye motion

of the flesh, without the heat of carnall desire, and without ye foule delight of wanton lust. Whereby the seedes conceiued are adulterate, defiled, & corrupte: Of the which the soule or lyfe at ye length poured into the body, doth gather the spot of sin, the blemish of offence
                        •
                      and the corruption of iniquitie, lyke as an euill seasoned vessell poysoneth good liquor, or as that which is vncleane defileth the contrary. For the soule of man hath three naturall operations or vertues.The vertues of the soule. The first is, the vse of reason, to the ende it may disceyrne good from euill. The seconde is an aptenesse or inclynation to di
                        •
                     
                     lyke, that thereby it may shunne or declyne from that which is euill. The thyrde is a disposition or pronenesse to affecte, that thereby it may desire and lyke that which is good. These three effectes or vertues are in man from his byrthe, greatly altered and obscured, by three contrary vices. For the vse of reasō is miscaried by ignorāce, yt it cānot discerne the good from the euill. The inclination to dislike or to be offended with that which is euil, is headlong hurled downe by the fury of anger, which causeth the refusal
                        •
                      oftentymes of that which is good: And the

affection to couet or desire yt which is good, is wholy ouerthrowne through the desire of euil. The first of these vertues or operations bringeth foorth offence, which consisteth in omittyng, & in Latyne is called Delictum.
                     
                        Delictum.
                      The last bringeth foorth sinne or trespasse, which doth consist in committing, and in Latine is called Peccatū.
                     
                        Peccatum.
                      The third (meane betwixte them both) bringeth forth bothe Delictum and Peccatum. For this worde Delictum signifieth nothing els but to omit that which ought to be done: and this word Peccatum doeth importe the doing of that which ought not to be done. These three vices doe spring through the corruption of our fleshe. For in the carnall acquaintance betwixt man and woman, the deepe consideration and force of reason is couered and 
                        •
                     upprest, and in steed therof ignorance taketh place: the flame of fleshly delight is kindled, whereby hir furie more increaseth: the great desire of pleasure is satiate, by the which concupiscence is ingendered. This is the Tyran of the fleshe, the lawe of the members, the nourishment and inflamation of sinne,The nourishment of sinne. the languishing and feblenesse of nature, and the foode of deathe. No man is borne without

it: which if at any tyme wee happilye passe ouer, not yelding thereunto, yet doeth hir force alwayes remayne actually graffed in our flesh:
                        1. Ioh. 1.
                      for if we shall say we haue no sinne, wee deceiue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs. O greeuous necessitie, and vnfortunate estate of man, before we can sinne we are fastened and straight linked to sinne, And before wee can offend, wee are bounde with offence.

neuer come in sight, bicause they are set forth to be beholden as monsters. For manye of them are borne dismembred, and corrupt in their senses, to the heauinesse and sorowe of their frendes, to the ignominie of their parentes, and to the rebuke of their kinsfolks. To what end should I speake this particularly of some, seeing that generally wee bee all borne impotent, without knowledge, without speech, and without strength?

For there is no payne lyke to the grief of a woman labouring with childe. Wherefore Rachel through ye exceeding great payne of trauail with hir childe departing out of this life,

                      as it were but yesterday, which is already past. For the things which God will haue come to passe, are alwayes springing: and things present doe dayly decaye and perish: and those things which are past, are cleane dead and consumed. We then are dying whiles we liue, and then doe we cease from dying, when we cease to liue. Therefore it is better to dye
                        •
                      alwayes to liue, than to liue to dye euer. For the mortall lyfe of man is but a liuing death. Whereuppon (sayth Salomon) I commend more the estate of those that be dead,Boke of the preacher. 4. than of those that liue: and I iudge him that is not yet borne happier than them both. The lyfe of man passeth swiftly away and can not be stayed, and death commeth vppon him instantlye and can not bee hindered. Man therefore is that wonderfull thing which doth decrease, and encrease, and al in a moment. For howe

much the more mans life encreaseth, so much the neerer he approcheth to his ende.
               
               
                  Of the terror of dreames. Chap. 22.
                  THe verye tyme whyche is graunted man in this lyfe for his rest, is not permitted to be quiet vnto hym: for in dreames, dreadfull things often times appeare, which cause a manne to feare, and visions in hys sleepes doe molest him. And although in very deede those things which men dreame of, be not sorowfull, terrible, or payneful: yet for certaynetie, those whyche are molested with such dreames, are caused to be pensiue, sorowfull, and fearefull. In so muche, that sometymes in their sleepes, they feruently weepe, and when they are waked out thereof, are often troubled in their minds. Marke well what Elephas Thematices sayeth of this matter.
                        Iob. 4.
                      In the terror of a vision (sayeth hee) in the night time when men are wonte to sleepe, a greate feare and trembling came vppon mee, and all my bones did shake for feare,
                        Iob. 7.
                      and when the spirit passed in my presence, the heare of my head stood vp. Consider the saying of Iob also in these wordes:

If I say vnto my selfe, my bedde shall comfort me, and I shall bee eased, talking with my selfe vpon my couch: thou wilte terrifie me with dreames and wilte make me shake for feare through visyons. Nabuchodonozer sawe in a dreame,
                        Daniel. 2.
                      that thing whiche made him throughly afrayde, and the vision being firmely imprest in his mynde, dyd much vexe & trouble him.

For the flesh foloweth pleasures, the eye regardeth riches, and the mynd respecteth honours.

Wherevpon (saith Salomon) When the rich man speaketh, euery one keepeth silence,Booke of Iesus. 12. and what he saith, they extoll it vp to the clowds: but when the poore man telleth his tale, they say, what felow is this? and if be offend in any word, they will ouerthrowe him.

If by chance you take in hād the cause of the poore, you folowe it slowly: but when you take in hande the riche mans cause, you folowe it most earnestlye. You despise the poore, you honor the riche: with reuerence you giue place to those that bee welthie, but contemptuously you reiecte those that bee needy.

                      If thou doest flow in wealthe, set not thy hart thereon. And on the contrary syde, the couetous men doe possesse all things, and yet are they as though they hadde nothing, as the same Prophete witnesseth in another place:
                        Psal. 33

                      The riche men saith he, were needy and hungrie: For it is more easie to finde one that loueth riches and hath them not, than to finde one that hath them, and doth not loue them
                        •
                      bycause it is harde to be amiddes the fire and not to burne, and more harder to possesse riches and not to loue them.

For where dronkennesse is the mysteresse, there secrecie beareth no maistrie. For commonly when the heade is full of wyne, the tongue is set at libertie. Besides this, wyne only doth not suffice a dronkard, neyther is he content with many sorts of wine, as Cysar, Bastard, Hypocras, and such like: but he drowneth his senses in al varietie of liquor, making him selfe the monster of excesse. This is the nurserie of al cōtention and strife. For as ye wise man saith,Booke of Iesus

               And then the reckning brought to quiet ende,
               A ioyful state of better life doth lende.
            
            
               Thou God therfore that rules the rolling skie,
               Thou Lorde that lendes the props wheron we stay,
               And turnes the spheares, and tempers all on hie,
               Come, come in haste, to take vs hence away:
               Thy goodnesse shal we then engraue for aye,
               And sing a song of endlesse thankes to thee,
               That deignest so from death to set vs free:
               Redeeming vs from depth of darke decay.
               With foure and twentie elders shal we say,
               To him be glorie, power
                     •
                   and praise alone,
               That with the Lambe, doth sit in loftie throne.
            
            FINIS.
