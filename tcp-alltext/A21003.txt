            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR Charles Blunt, Lord Mountioy, Knight of the moſt noble order of the Garter, Captaine of Portſmouth, and one of her Maieſties Lieutenants for the Countie of South.

               IF Chriſtians in theſe daies were as religious in dedicating of their books, as Heathen men in former time were ſuperſtitious in dedicating of their Churches, I doubt not but men would bee as farre

from writing of bookes, as they are from building of Churches. In dedication of their Temples they were (as it is reported) too curious; in dedicating of our bookes we are (as it appeareth) too negligent. They regarded time, place, circumſtance and perſon; we neither reſpect time, place, circumſtance nor perſon. Indeede the three former doe not much concerne vs at all, but as for the laſt it ſhould be the firſt thing which is to bee conſidered in euery booke: for it ſufficeth not that the booke be well written, vnleſſe the perſon to whom it is written bee fitting and agreeable with the booke. For as the Heathens neuer, or ſeldome 
                  •
               imes, dedicated their Temples to men touched with the ſame infirmities that they were, but either 
                  •
               nto the perſon of ſome great god

or goddeſſe, who might if neede were, be able to defend them: ſo ſhould not wee commit our labours and workes vnto their patronage and protection which are but ſimply men, ſcarce able for to helpe themſelues: but vnto ſuch as either for their vertues ſakes are better then men, as Ariſtotle ſaith, orels by reaſon of their places and offices in the Common-wealth, are farre aboue all other men in dignitie, and equall vnto GOD himſelfe (as the Scripture teſtifieth) in name. This reſpectiue care (Right Honorable) hath not ſomwhat, but altogether perſwaded me to offer vp this ſmall booke of Morall Philoſophie (which I tranſlated as well vpon iuſt commendations of the author, as alſo vpon intreatie of my kind friend a learned Doctor of Diuinitie) into your

Honors hands: not as if I meant to interprete the ſame vnto your Lordſhip, which better knoweth the French tongue and other languages then my ſelf, or moſt men doe: but for as much as this ſmall booke had great neede of ſome worthie Patron, and none more worthie then your Honor was to be found, whether your rare vertues bee to bee regarded, or the place which you hold with honor in this Common-w

is he that will regard a booke if it be little? ſo little doe men conſider the goodnes of things, when they meaſure all things by greatnes: as if Dauid were not little when he ſlew Goliah the giant; the clowde little which threatned all Iſrael with raine; the oyle little in the pitcher which filled all the emptie veſſels of the widow. And as that oyle was little vntill the time that it was powred foorth: ſo ſmall bookes when they come abroad into mens hands, if they be furniſhed with doctrine, are of great power to conuert men vnto p

The Stoicks are as odious vnto ſome men, as they themſelues are hated of others: they call the profeſſors hereof in their gibing manner ſtockes, and not Stoicks, becauſe of the affinitie of their names. And I pray why may not wee call them wiſards as well as wiſe men by the ſame reaſon? Philoſophie in generall is profitable vnto a Chriſtian man, if it be well and rightly vſed: but no kinde of philoſophie is more profitable and neerer approching vnto Chriſtianitie (as S. Hierome ſaith) then the philoſophie of the Stoicks. Let vs then that are Chriſtians follow them as farre

               phie of the Stoicks.
            
               THere is nothing in the worlde, which tendeth not to one end or other: yea, euen thinges inſenſible doe aduance themſelues (as it ſeemeth) and make themſelues fit for that vſe, vnto ye which they doe properlie belong: and being applied thereunto, doe ſhew forth a kind of ioy, and ſeeme to haue a feeling of the perfection and happines of their eſtates. Things that haue action in them, mooue of

themſelues in ſuch ſort as we ſee; all creatures in generall, and euery one ſeuerally in his kinde, with great vehemencie & contention, followeth and purſueth after that, for which they are borne & bred, and doe moſt certainlie reioyce and exult in the fruition of that which they ſeeke, when they haue found it out. What then ought man to doe, vpon whom nature, beſides this inclination and motion which dead things doe partake with him, hath endued with ſence, and ouer and beſides ſence, which is common to him and other creatures, hath giuen the benefit of diſcourſe and reaſon, to be able to diſcerne and chuſe the beſt things of all thinges which preſent themſelues vnto his conſideration, and that which is moſt

fit and proper to his vſe? May we not ſafely conclude, that man alſo hath his ende, as well as all other creatures; which is ſet before him as the furthermoſt marke and butte, whereto all his actiōs ſhuld be directed: and ſithence that the happines of all things is their perfection, and their perfection the fruition of their end, ſhall not the happines and felicitie of man conſiſt in the 
                  •
               ul obtaining and attaining vnto that which is propoſed vnto him, and whereunto all his actions are to bee referred? Now the ende of man and of all his thoughts & meditations is good. And truely, there is not one amongſt many, ſo diuers in nature and condition of life, which deſireth not that which is good, and eſchueth not that which is euill:

and being demanded wherefore hee doth this or that, anſwereth not, but that he doth it, or thinkes that he doth it for his good and welfare. And albeit in our actiōs, a man may finde a great manie more bad then good; yet the generall intention, whereby wee are directed and guided, is to come vnto that which is good. But as it fareth manie times with him which aymeth at a marke, if his ſight be hindered, either by ſome diſeaſe of the eye, or fault in the ayre, or if hee take one thing for another, although he deſire to hit the marke, ſo that he couet nothing more, yet it is impoſſible but he ſhould be wide from it: ſo likewiſe wee, becauſe we doe not knowe wherein conſiſteth our good, but oftentimes take that

which is about it, for it; do therefore in our particular actions take our ayme amiſſe, and ſhoot wide from our generall marke and intention.
            Good, in good trueth, is not ſo placed that all the world may ſee and perceiue it; nature hath ſowed and ſcattered heere beneath amongſt vs certaine weake and feeble ſparklinges of that heate, which notwithſtanding beeing rightly applied vnto our mindes, are able to kindle a pure light in them, and cauſe vs to ſee good, as it is, and not as it ſeemeth. So then, wee muſt ſeeke it, and wee ſhall finde it; hauing found it, we muſt acknowledge it; acknowledging it, wee cannot chooſe but loue it; and louing it, wee ſhall faſten all our deſires thereunto, and

enioy it with great happines. For euen as trueth preſenting it ſelfe vnto our vnderſtanding, is there entertained with great ioy and contentednes: euen ſo good offering it ſelfe vnto our will, is receiued by her with great pleaſure, as being her naturall obiect. And therefore, I thinke, that if a man would properly define good, hee muſt affirme it to bee nothing els, but the eſſence & vſage of a thing, according vnto his nature. For this ſame nature is ſo prudent and prouident a miſtreſſe, that ſhe alwaies diſpoſeth all things vnto their greateſt good, and therefore hath giuen them a firſt motion vnto that which is good, and vnto that ende which they ſhould ſeeke and ſearch after: in ſuch ſort, that he that will followe after it,

cannot chooſe but compaſſe and obtaine it. Now by the rules of nature, man ſhould be ſo compoſed and faſhioned, that that which is moſt excellent in him, ſhould beare rule and commaund, and that reaſon ſhould 
                  •
               ſe all that which is preſented vnto her, as beſt beſeemeth her, and ſhal moſt ſerue for her purpoſe.
            Well then, the good & happines of man, conſiſteth in the right vſe of reaſon
                  •
                and what is that but vertue, which is nothing els but a conſtant diſpoſition of will, to followe that which is honeſt and conuenient. There is no man, as I ſuppoſe, but wil auouch this to be good: but yet for all that, there wil bee a great many found out, which will affirme, yt herein onely conſiſteth not mans good & happines,

but that hee muſt haue a ſound and well diſpoſed bodie, and a hundred more commodities, without the which it is not poſſible for mans life to be, much leſſe to be happie and 
                  •
               ortunate. But if our poſition which we haue ſet downe vnto you at the firſt bee true, (as true it is) that the end of euery thing is his good, and his good is his end, and that theſe two are ſo reciprocable and conuertible the one with the other, that the one cannot bee without the other, then may we not iuſtly ſay, that health, or riches, are mans good, ſeeing that they are not his end which he regardeth. For hee cannot poſſeſſe or vſe them, but to ſome other end. And ſo too, that the greateſt part of his time, whileſt hee enioyeth them,

he cannot ioy in them, but is with them vnfortunate and vnhappie: vnleſſe peraduenture ſome man will ſaye, that they are happie, which make their riches & health ſerue them (as they doe full many in the world) to nouriſh their vices, and cheriſh them vp in their wicked paſſions and affections. But happily will ſome man ſay, they doe ſerue, as meanes and inſtruments diſpoſed vnto the attainment of this good, without the which it is not poſſible that a man ſhould get it, and therefore by a neceſſarie conſequent they are to be accounted neceſſarie, to the obtayning thereof, and therefore good. Truely it is a harſh and improper kinde of ſpeech, to call that good, which ſerues to the procurement and obtaining of

that which is good; or that which is the ſubiect and matter of good. For vertue, which we haue proued before to be the true good, is of ſuch a nature, that ſhe can make her benefit indifferently of things contrary in nature, ſhe profiteth and helpeth her ſelfe as wel by pouerti
                  •
                as by riches, by ſicknes as by health. For wee doe as much commend him that can patiently endure his pouertie, and conſtantly beare his griefes or diſeaſe, as we doe him that liberallie beſtoweth his goods, and being in health, honeſtly laboureth in his vocation. So that if you wil needs call riches good, becauſe they ſerue to the obtaining and getting of vertue, why may you not as well call pouertie by the ſame name, ſeeing that it ſerues to the

ſelfe ſame vſe, and that more profitablie alſo? Now to call things ſo contrary and repugnant, as riches & pouertie are, by the ſame name, hath not ſo much as any ſhew or apparance of any trueth. Wherefore, let all theſe things remaine indifferent, as being made good or euil, by the mind of man which knoweth how to vſe them rightly, which if he want, yet will he not want the meanes of attayning vnto his ende, which is to be faſhioned and framed rightly according vnto reaſon, and to make vſe and benefit of all things which ſhall happen whatſoeuer, & conſequently to purchaſe his chiefe good and felicitie.
            If wee will truly know wherein conſiſteth this good, let vs conſider within our ſelues what that is

which ſeekes it: for it muſt needs be the good of that part
                  •
                Nothing ſeeks after that which is anothers, vnles it bee coupled and ioyned with his owne. Now then there is no doubt but that the beginning and firſt motion of all our actions commeth from the vnderſtanding and will, and therefore the good which we ſeeke after, muſt needs be the perfection, reſt and contentment of the ſame. But if wee place riches and health in this account, and eſteeme them for things good, and by a conſequent repute all things contrary vnto them euil; what doe we els, but teſ
                  •
               ifie vnto all men, that there is no true felicitie in this world, and that our minds are here held in perpetuall torment? For a man muſt needes haue death and griefe

continuallie before his eyes, both which are eſteemed euils, and whereof one is oftentimes preſent with him, the other neuer 
                  •
               eaſeth to threaten and menace him. If then they be things euill, the feare of them is iuſt, & if he be alwaies in feare, how can hee bee at any time happie? Let vs therefore confeſſe, that either man hath no good ordained and prepared for him in this world, which he may compaſſe and attaine vnto, or els acknowledge, that this good doth wholly and entirely conſiſt in vertue. For it muſt needs be that the end of euery thing ſhould be proportionable vnto the ſtrength and nature of the thing it ſelfe: for other wiſe, if the end were vnpoſſible to be atchieued, in ſtead of being mans good, it would turne to

be mans further torment. And ſo he ſhould nothing but labour and trauaile in vaine, as the daughters of Danaus are ſayd to doe in hell, ſtriuing to fill certaine bottomles veſſels with water, which cā hold no water at all. Againe, if there bee no Science nor Arte in the world, which hath not one end or other limited her, which they may come vnto by keeping of certaine precepts and rules; what ſhall we thinke that nature, the mother of Arts and Sciences, hath propoſed vnto man (which is her chiefe worke) an end, which it is vnpoſſible for him to come vnto, becauſe it is out of his power?
            Will (as we ſay) is that which ſeeketh after our good: now a ruled and well gouerned will neuer coueteth (as indeede it ought not

to doe) but that which ſhe may, and which it is in her power to procure, ſhe buſieth not her ſelfe about hauing of that which it is not in her power to haue when ſhe will; as health, riches, and honors. For if our good did conſiſt and depend of them, wee ſhould not neede to imploy reaſon or will to the procurement of them, but we might as well compaſſe them by prayers & wiſhes: for it is a thing which is ſubiect vnto a thouſand caſualties, which cannot bee pr

creatures, that his good, which is his perfection, ſhould depend not onely vpon other matters, but vpon ſo many things, that a mā hath no hope to haue them all fauourable vnto him; but that he ſhuld here bene

Nay doubtles, Nature doth offer you ſo much to the getting of this good, as a minde well diſpoſed and fit to vſe any thing which ſhall be layd before it, and to paſſe ouer thoſe things which doe farre paſſe his reach and capacitie. Will you then rather chooſe to runne vnto Fortune, and waite at her deceitfull handes for that good, which you may giue vnto your ſelfe and if you will? For this is a diuine and inuiolable lawe, which hath been made ſince the

beginning of the world, that if we will haue any good, we muſt purchaſe and get it our ſelues, by our owne labour and induſtrie. For nature hath prouided a rich ſtorehouſe of all good things, and incloſed it in our minds: let vs then but ſtretch forth the hands of our will, and we ſhall take as much as we will. For if the will of man bee well guided and ordered, it will turne all things to her good, as M

                  das turned all things that he touched into golde. There is no accident ſo grieuous, which can befall a man either in bodie or riches, whence a man may not reap ſome reſt and comfort of minde: ſo that if we can here reſt & content our ſelues, wee haue alreadie found out our end. For though we ſhould remit ſo much of the ſeueritie

of this ſect, as to confeſſe that the bodie or goods, which are but inſtruments of mans life, were a part of mans ſubſtance, and might by their qualitie alter the qualitie of the ſoule; yet may wee not auouch this for good, that loſſe

               e, is able to hinder the felicitie and happines of man, if his minde enioy quiet reſt and content.
            In things which are compounded of many partes, the moſt noble part giueth both name and lawes vnto the reſt, and they take their denominatiō from her: what doubt then can there bee, but that man ſhould bee wholly happie, if his minde enioyeth his happines. And ſo wee ſay, that a Commonwealth is happie after a great victorie, although there bee many citizens

loſt, becauſe the happineſſe thereof is meaſured by the perſon of the Prince, or els of the ſtate, to the good and ſeruice of whom all the reſt muſt be obedient. Hence is it that particular men doe euen glorie in their wounds, doe euen bragge and boaſt of them, if they haue receiued them in the defence of either Prince or countrie. Shall we than aſſigne vnto the bodie any other motion or deſire then that, by the which it referreth all things that come vnto him, vnto the ioy and happines of the mind? ſhall we, I ſay bee ſo fooliſh as to linke and knit the ſoule ſo faſt vnto the bodie, that the good thereof ſhould remaine as a ſlaue within his members, and ſo farre foorth depend on them, that accordingly as the bodie ſhould be well or ill

diſpoſed, the mind ſhould be altered, and accounted either happie or vnhappie? Truly, if ſo bee that nature would haue had mans happines and perfection to haue depended on his bodie, or conſiſted in his goods, ſhe would haue giuē vnto all men like bodies, and like meaſure and quantitie of goods: for ſo ſhe ſhould not haue been partiall
                  •
                but equall vnto all, and ſo haue paſſed from the generall vnto euery particular of that kinde. But on the contrary ſide, ſhe hauing made all men of very diuers natures and conditions, both in reſpect of their bodies, as alſo in regarde of their goods, hath notwithſtanding graunted vnto all men like power and abilitie of wel vſing their bodies or riches of what ſort ſoeuer they bee, in ſuch ſort,

that the action of the minde may bee as honorable and glorious in one ſort as in another: yea, the excellencie thereof doth appeare & ſhine foorth more gloriouſly, and merit more praiſe then, when being deſtitute of meanes and inſtruments, he commeth of himſelf vnto his wiſhed end. For ſo in my opinion, wee are to iudge him to bee the skilfuller pilot in a ſhippe, which can in a great tempeſt, amidſt the raging flouds, guide an old ſea-beaten ſhip full of holes, whoſe ſayles are rent, and ropes broken; then hee which can tell how to gouerne a new ſhip well rigged and furniſhed with all neceſſaries, hauing winde at wil, and ſeas fauourable. Therefore we will heere conclude this poynt thus: Seeing that the happines of man

doth lye in procuring of his good, and that his good is to li
                  •
               e according vnto nature; and to liue according vnto nature, is not to bee troubled with any paſsions or perturbations of the minde, but ſo to behaue himſelf, happen what happen may, as that he do not exceed patience, or paſſe the bounds of reaſon; that if wee will bee truelie happie, we muſt purge our minds of all manner of paſsions, & learne how to be affected in minde towards all things which ſhall happen.
            Now there is nothing which can ſo ſoone ſet vs in this way, and learne vs how to obtaine the right courſe of ordering our affections, mindes and wils according vnto reaſon, as Wiſedome, which is (in my ſimple opinion) both the beginning

and end of all vertues. For cauſing vs to haue an exact and true knowledge of the condition and qualitie of things which come into our conſiderations & viewes, ſhe teacheth and telleth vs what is according vnto nature, and what not, and like wiſe what is to be deſired and followed, or ſhunned and auoyded. She remoues al falſe opinions out of our heads which trouble our braines, makes our affections kind and naturall, and finally vpon her waite all other vertues, as being their mother, nurſe, and keeper. O how happie would mans life bee, if it were alwayes led and guided by her direction? But alas, as this vertue is moſt faire and excellent, ſo ſhe is moſt rare and hard to be found: for ſhe is ſo hidden in the bottome of our

mindes, as the veynes of gold lye ſecret in the bowels of the earth, and are found but in few places. This is (as I bele
                  •
               ue) that great, ſtately, and impenetrable buckler which Vulcan forged for Achilles, wherein were ingrauen heauen & earth, the ſea, clowdes, ſtarres, lightnings, cities, weapons, aſſemblies of people, and combats: and in a word, there was nothing in the world which was not there to bee ſeene: ſignifying vnto vs by that deuice, that wiſedome & the true knowledge of things, doth better preſerue the minde of man from danger, then the buckler or helmet doth keep the bodie from wounds. But as Achilles went to ſchoole vnto Chiron to learne the vſe of that buckler: ſo we muſt go to ſchoole to Philoſophy, to know

the right vſe of wiſedoome. And if wee will hearken vnto her, ſhe will tell vs, that wiſedome hath two properties and vſes, the one to prick vs forward to that which is good, the other to pull vs backe from following that which is euil. Now becauſe when we come vnto Philoſophie, we doe not bring with vs a mind pure and neat, but alreadie diſtempered, euilly diſpoſed, and poſſeſſed with filthie humours, and ſuch as are incident vnto the common ſort of people; becauſe, I ſay, wee come vnto her as vnto a skilfull leach or cunning phiſition: therefore if we will bee cured, wee muſt doe as ſurgeons doe which haue to doe with ſores and wounds, who before they apply any medicine or ſalue to cure them, doe firſt draw out all the

bad humours and dead fleſh: and ſo muſt we alſo in like manner begin firſt of all to purge our minds of all ſuch paſsions as doe ariſe in them, and with the ſmoke of them darken and obſcure the eye of reaſon: for otherwiſe precepts of manners and wholeſome inſtructions would profite our ſoules as little, as plentie of meate doth a corrupted bodie, which the more you feede the more you offend.
            Now to know what theſe paſſions are, you muſt vnderſtande, that we doe terme them a viol
                  •
               nt or vehement motion of the ſoule in the ſenſitiue part, which is cauſed in the following or eſchuing of that which ſeemeth to be either good or euill. For albeit there be but one ſoule in euery one of vs, which is the cauſe of life, & fountaine

of all our actions, and is all in all, and all in 
                  •
               uery part: yet there bee many faculties in the ſoule, which it is ſtraunge to ſee, how diuers, yea how contrari
                  •
                they be many times one towards another, according vnto the diuerſitie of inſtruments and veſſels where it is kept, and varietie of obiects which are offered vnto her. In one place ſhe cauſeth vegetation, in another motion, in another ſence, in another deſire or appetite, in another imagination, in another remembrance, in another reaſon and diſcourſe: euen as the Sunne, which though he bee all in his owne eſſence, yet diuiding and parting his beames in diuers places, he bringeth heat to one place, and light to another, ſofteneth waxe and hardens clay, ſcattereth

the clowds, and drieth vp ſtanding pooles and lakes. And when the parts where the ſoule lieth incloſed, doc retaine and vſe her but in a proportion of their capacities, and as farr
                  •
                foorth as it is neceſſarie for their conuenient vſe, then ſhe bringeth foorth gentle, ſweet, and orderly effects: but contrariwiſe, if her parts doe take mor
                  •
                heate and motion then is requiſite and conuenient, you ſhall haue cleane cōtrary operations, & ſuch as will proue very hurtful and preiudiciall vnto the ſoule: and right ſo for all the world fareth it with the Sunne, who as long as his beames do wanderabroad, according vnto their naturall and wonted libertie, doe gently and moderatly heate the earth: but if they be gathered and knit together in

the hollow of a burning Chriſtall, they doe burne and 
                  ••
               nſume that, which they were wont before to cheriſh and quicken. Now it hath pleaſed nature to grant vnto ſence this power and ſtrength which commeth from the ſoule, to applie it ſelfe vnto things, and extract their formes, and afterwards either to chooſe or refuſe them, as they ſhall beſt pleaſe or diſpleaſe him, and agree or diſagree with his nature. And this is done for two reaſons: one, becauſe they ſhould be in ſtead of ſentinels vnto the bodie ſtill watching and warding for his good: the other, which is a principall cauſe indeede, becauſe they ſhould bee meſſengers and vantcouriers from the ſoueraigne and chiefeſt part of the ſoule, and alſo ſerue for miniſters and inſtruments

of bettering our diſcourſe and reaſon. But as ſhe hath alotted them this power and authoritie: ſo ſhe doth moſt ſtraitly will and command them to cōtent themſelues with their office, which is to call to mind things paſt, & thereupon to aduiſe themſelues what is beſt to be done: not preſuming or daring to diſquiet the higher and ſtronger faculties, or breede any further vprore or confuſion. For ſo it falleth out many times in an armie, that the watch becauſe they know not the purpoſe of the Generall, whoſe direction they ſhould follow, may be deceiued, and take the enemie comming vnto them diſguiſed, for friends, and their friends which come in good will to ſuccour and relieue them for enemies: and euen ſo

the ſences, becauſe they cannot throughly conceiue and comprehend thinges appertaining vnto reaſon, as being aboue their reach, are beguiled with ſhew and appearance of thinges, and doe oft times iudge that for a friend vnto vs, which is our greateſt aduerſarie. And ſo whileſt they preſently ruſh forward without ſtaying, or looking for any commandement from reaſon, they prouoke and ſtir vp that part of the ſoule where concupiſcence and anger dooth lodge, whereby ſpringeth ſuch a 
                  •
               umult & hurly burly in the mind, that reaſon during this furie can not bee heard, nor vnderſtanding o

               eied, no more thē lawes or Magiſtrates are regarded in a ſtate rent and torne with euill diſſention. But in this trouble, the paſſions

which doe waxe moſt mutinous and troubleſome vnto the quiet reſt of the ſpirit, doe firſt ariſe in the appetible or concupiſcible parte, that is to ſay, in that place where the ſoule doth exe

               ciſe this facultie of deſiring or reiecting things preſented vnto her, as being things proper or contrary vnto her welfare and preſeruation. So then, their firſt moouing and ſpringing is vpon a ſhew and apparance or imagination of ſome good or euill. Now if it be of ſome preſent good, which ſhe doth alreadie begin to poſſeſſe, wee call this motion by the name of ple
                  •
               
               ſure: but if it bee of ſome good 
                  •
               o come, which is as yet farre eſtranged from vs, we call it deſire: 
                  •

               uenience and griefe whereof we doe

alreadie feele, being moued and incenſed againſt another, we call it hatred or horror: and being moued within our ſelues, diſcontentednes, which if it happen vpon occaſion of any thing which concernes vs, we call it ſorrow: if by reaſon of another mans euill, pitie: if by occaſion of an apparant good where wee pretend a part, ielouſie: if otherwiſe, enuie. Againe, to fall backe vnto the ſecond part of our ſecond generall diuiſion: if it be of ſome after enſuing euill, it is rightly termed by the name of feare.
            See here the firſt band of theſe ſeditious paſsions, which ſo much trouble the quiet reſt of our ſoule, which are accōpanied with moſt daungerous effects, and yet nothing like ſo daungerous as are

thoſe which follow after. For why? theſe firſt motions being bred and formed in that part, by meanes of the obiect which preſents it ſelfe, doe paſſe foorth incontinentlie vnto the iraſcible part of ye mind, that is to ſay, to the place where the ſoule ſeekes al meanes poſsible of obtayning or auoyding that which ſeeme

               h vnto 
                  •

               ed with the firſt apprehenſion, hauing a ſecond ſtrength added vnto the former, is whirled about with greater violence then before, and ſtirres vp more ſtrong and vntameable paſſions, becauſe they are doubled and coupled with the

former, and ſo being ioyned together, doe ſtay and ſtrengthen one another with mutuall helpe and conſent. For the firſt paſſions, which are found of the obiect of ſome imagined or ſeeming good, conſidering with themſelues of the meanes how to obtaine and acquire it, do ſtirre vp in vs either hope or deſpayre: but thoſe affections which are made of the obiect of ſome ſeeming euill, doe bring forth feare and anger: which foure paſſions are wonderfullie ſtrong and violent, and doe wholly ouerturne the frame of reaſon which they finde alreadie tottering.
            Heere beholde and marke the foure winds (as I verely ſuppoſe) from whence ſpring the cruell tempeſts of our ſoules. Their den

from whence they come, is nothing els (as hath been alreadie ſhewed you) but a falſe imagination which wee haue, that thoſe things which are preſented vnto vs are either good or euill. For by this meanes attributing that qualitie vnto them, which indeede is not in them, wee flye or follow after them with vehemencie: and this is the very originall and ſpring of theſe paſſions. Well then to ſtoppe this den, aſſure the reſt of our ſoules, and prouide that they be not otherwiſe moued then it is meete for them to bee, let vs call to minde that which was proued vnto vs in the very beginning and entrance into this diſcourſe. To wit, that the good of a man, and the perfection of his nature, conſiſteth in the diſpoſing and

faſhioning of his will to the right vſe of things according vnto reaſon: and contrariwiſe, that his euill commeth from a diſordered or vnskilfull vſing, or rather abuſing of them. For by the firſt hee ſhall reape much profite, receiue much content and quietnes, and chance what chance, nay he may ſet vp his reſt, and remain as ſtable andimmoueable as a rocke in the middeſt of the ſea: by the ſecond, euery ſmall thing that chaunceth will trouble him and turne to his great griefe and diſaduantage. Now this diſpoſition of our will lieth whollie in our power, and conſequently our good and euill. Wherefore, if at anytime there be preſented vnto vs any obiect, to the endethat we may not be troubled at all as with ſome good or

euill which doth follow vs, let vs conſider whether the thing which happeneth be in our power or no. If it bee in our power well and good, it may bee good or ill vnto vs. And yet in this caſe too, wee muſt not be too paſſionaetly affected in any ſort: for if we can but moderate and guide our willes aright, we ſhall make it good, and ſo continue it ſtill. If it be out of our power, then it is neither good nor euill, and conſequently wee ought not to ſeeke or prouide it.
            Now the things which are in our power are theſe; to approue, vndertake, deſire, and eſchue a matter, and in a word, all our actions. For our will hath authoritie and power to rule and gouerne them according vnto reaſon, till they come vnto the place from

whence our good and happineſſe muſt come. As for example ſake, ſhe is able to diſpoſe our opinion, ſo that it yeeld not conſent but to that which it is meete it ſhould, and which ſhall bee examined either by ſence or reaſon, that ſhee ſhal cleaue faſt vnto things which are euidently true of themſelues, and keepe her ſelfe in ſuſpence in things doubtfull, and vtterly reiect thinges which are of themſelues plainly vntrue and falſe. Beſides, ſhee can ſo rule our deſire, that it ſhall follow after nothing but that which is agreeable with nature, and eſchue the contrarie. The things which are out of our power are theſe; our riches, reputation, and briefly, that which doth no way depend of our willes: and here, if any thing doe happen, wee

may not ſay that it is contrarie to our natures: becauſe it happeneth either by the vniuerſall and continuall order of things, and ordinary co
                  •
               tinuance of cauſes, and therefore ſhould not ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs: or els commeth to paſſe by ſome particular prouidence ſo ordering it, and then we muſt know that nature hath made vs ſubiect thereunto. Furthermore, ſhe hath giuen vs a power and abilitie in the ſoule of well vſing and applying our ſelues to all that which ſhall happen vnto vs from without; which ſheweth that ſhe hath not made vs fit and proper to one thing, but to euery thing which ſhall come vnto vs whatſoeuer: in ſuch ſort that we may not deſire or flie any ſuch externall thing which is not in our power, as well

for that is a very fooliſh and vaine affection to will that which it is not in our power to haue, as alſo becauſe that howſoeuer it happen, it may proue good vnto vs, and be the ſubiect of many worthie and laudable actions. Now then if we can ſo commaund our ſelues and our minds, as not to deſire or flye any thing which is out of our powers, but with a ſober & moderate affection receiue and entertaine it when it commeth, we ſhall bee altogether exempted from all troubles and perturbations of the minde, wee ſhall bee free and happie, and neuer fruſtrated of our expectations, or hindered in our affayres and enterpriſes: wee ſhall not neede to hate any man, to complaine of any man, to feare any man, or to be angry with

any man: for no man ſhall be able to do vs harme. On the other ſide, if we deſire and labour to auoyde that which is out of our powers, wee ſhall oftentimes fall from our hopes and wiſhed ends, and miſſe of our purpoſes, and light vpon that which wee ſo much abhorre, wee ſhall trouble our ſelues, vexe and torment our ſelues, and all to no purpoſe or end in the world.
            There is no man ſo fooliſh or vnaduiſed, but that hee confeſſeth that he had rather haue his deſires then be depriued of them, and rather be free from paſſions, then to be troubled with them, if hee may doe otherwiſe. Is there any man then that will denye this to bee a very good, profitable, and natural rule, by the which he may obtaine any thing which he deſires, if hee

deſire not any thing which he can not obtaine? and by the which we learne not to bee paſſionate, or ouermuch penſiue for any thing which ſhal happen, placing good and euill in ou
                  •
                power, giuing vs one, and taking away the other from vs when we will? Therefore when any thing doth chance vnto vs, that we may not trouble or vexe our ſelues, let vs conſider foorthwith whether it bee in our power or no: if it bee, let vs ſo order our will that wee may direct and guide all things vnto their true and naturall vſes: and if we do ſo, we ſhall bee ſure to receiue good thereby: but if vpon inquirie we find them not to be in our power, let vs not bee mooued a whit, but haue this worde alwaies in ou
                  •
                mouthes, as a very profitable and

wholeſome inſtruction. This thing toucheth not me at all, it cōcernes not me, that is to ſay, it is neither my good nor my euill, and conſequently neither ſeeke after nor auoyde it: but when it happeneth I wil make the beſt of it that I can, by applying it vnto the beſt vſe I can, and which it is poſſible for me to referre it vnto. And if wee finde our ſelues to be further moued, and y• any one of the aforenamed paſſions be ſtirred vp in vs, by apprehending the obiect of things which are out of our power, let vs ſtraight waies weigh and conſider the nature of it which offereth it ſelfe, and wherefore it is ſent vnto vs: thē let vs examine our ſelues, to know vnto what paſſion we are moſt inclined
                  •
                and what effects it bringeth with it: afterwards let vs

marke in our ſelues what vertue is oppoſed againſt it, & what power and abilitie nature hath granted to rule and gouerne it. For as the paſſion commeth from without, and entereth into vs together with the image of the ſubiect, which offereth it ſelfe vnto our view: ſo nature hath 
                  •
               enced vs within with a ſtrong bulwarke or rampire to backe vs againſt the force hereof, that is, hath graunted vs ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt it, and if that we bee willing thereunto. Therefore the better to fortifie and ſtrengthē this power, let vs furniſh our ſelues with certaine wiſe precepts and ſhort ſentences touching euerie paſſion, wherewith wee may the better bee able to maintaine reaſon, and as it were with the edge of the ſword cu
                  •
                off all ſuch firſt and

ſudden motions of the minde, as may any waies violence it. And to make theſe precepts ſtronger and harder to bee ouercome, let vs ſtuffe them out with braue and worthie examples of men in former time, which haue behaued themſelues right valiantly vpon ſuch or the like occaſions. For the example of vertue in others, engageth vs to bee likewiſe vertuous, and their commendation is a profitable inſtruction for vs to imitate and reſemble them.
            Therefore as ſoone as any ſubiect of pleaſure for the bodie, as delicate and daintie meates doe come into our mind, and that we doe finde our ſelues mooued; let vs think thus, that this is one of the things which is not in our power, neither good nor euill: but an indifferent

thing, a thing which na
               
                  •
               ure hath giuen vs for our ſuſte
               
                  •
               ance, and being taken moderatly, preſerues the bodie in health, and makes it a fit and able inſtrument for the minde: but contrariwiſe, the exceſſe and ſuperfluitie thereof greatly weakeneth the bodie, and engendreth many grieuous and daungerous diſeaſes, which are the puniſhment which nature vſeth to bridle our intemperance withall. But if once wee looſe the reines vnto our appetites to follow abundance or delicatenes of meate, we ſhall bee held in perpetuall torment and paine, things ſuperfluous will proue but neceſſarie vnto vs, and the minde e
                  •
               tſoones will become a ſlaue vnto the bodie, and wee ſhall finde that we liue but to eate & drink.

Therefore wee muſt temper thi
                  •
                pleaſure with a moderate vſe, and learne to know that it is ſobrietie that doth preſerue the bodie ſound and the mind pure. And therefor

                let vs frame vnto our ſelues this rule in our diet, to vſe meate for our neceſſitie of foode and maintenance, and let vs not accuſtom
                  •
                our ſelues to delicious fare an
                  •
                daintie meats, leaſt happily being depriued of them our bodies be
                  •
               ll diſpoſed, and our mindes diſcontented: but contrariwiſe, let vs ordinarily vſe our ſelues to groſſer meates, as well for that they make vs more ſtrong and ſound, as alſo for that they are more eaſily to be gotten. For it is an eſpecial fauour of nature, for the which ſhe deſerueth ſingular great thankes at our hands, that ſhe hath made things

neceſſarie for our life moſt eaſie to be found, & that the things which are not found but with great difficultie, are nothing neceſſarie at all. And truly I cannot chuſe but admire the words of Epicurus, but I would they had proceeded out of another mans mouth, becauſe I would not haue ſo worthie a ſentence marred with the effeminatenes of the reſt of his opiniōs: My bodie (quoth he) daunceth for ioy, and my heart within me is rauiſhed with pleaſure, to think that I being content with bread & water, ſhould bee able to contemne all the delicate fare of the world. And now if Epicurus gloried ſo much in the contempt of all dainties, what thinke you ſhould the Stoicks doe? ſhould not they reuerence and honour ſobrietie as

the very foundation of all other vertues, and ſuch a one as ſtifles all other vices in the cradle, & chokes them in the ſeede?
            We reade that the families of the Curij and Fabricij in Rome did get many ample victories ouer their enemies, yet were they not renowmed for any thing but for their frugalitie. Their feates of armes did for a certaine time aſſure the ſtate of the Romanes againſt their forraine enemies: but their ſobernes and frugalitie hath been a law to frame and faſhion the mindes and courages of them which did afterwards ouercome all the world: the figges and carrots which they preferred before the riches of the Samnites, were more pleaſant in taſte to them which ſucceeded them, then were

the delicate meates of Axicius in his time. Theſe reaſons may likewiſe ſerue vs to moderate thoſe exceeding great pleaſures which wee take in wearing coſtly apparell, and building ſtately houſes, & ſuch other things which are to be referred vnto the vſe of the bodie: for otherwiſe, if we doe not moderate and meaſure the pleaſures which wee conceiue in them by the neceſſitie of nature, the very opinion will draw vs into a perilous downfall, where we ſhal neither finde ſhore nor bottome. For example, firſt our ſhewes muſt be made of veluet, then of cloath of gold, and laſtly they muſt be finely embroydered with pearles and diamonds: and ſo likewiſe our houſes muſt bee firſt built with Marble, then with Iaſper, and finally

with Porphyre. It ſhall bee good therefore for vs to obſerue this courſe, that our apparell bee ſufficient to defend vs from the violence of heate and colde, and our houſes ſtrong enough to reſiſt winde and raine, and let vs not ſeeke any thing els: and if happily we finde any thing beſides, let vs not be moued therewith at all.
            But it ſeemeth that reaſon hath more adoe in reſiſting the pleaſures which come by ſight, and fruition of fayre and beautifull things, then it hath in conquering the pleaſures which wee haue but earſt entreated of. For wee imagine that the perſon which carrieth on his face the fauours of nature printed in a rare and beautifull ſort, hath a lawfull power ouer vs, and that drawing our eyes

vnto it, it draweth our affections likewiſe thither, and enthralles thē vnto it euen againſt our willes. But what then? let vs remember that it is a thing meerely without vs, and that it is a grace and fauour which nature hath beſtowed vpō the perſon which enioyeth it, and not vpon vs: and that it is a thing, the vſe and poſſeſſion wherof may be as preiudiciall as profitable vnto vs: and laſt of all, let vs conſider that it is but a floure which continually fadeth, and nothing els but as it were the colour of a bodie. If you ſuffer your ſelfe to bee carried away with this mad and frantike paſſion, where ſhall a man finde you? you cannot bee your owne man any longer; your bodie muſt needes endure a thouſand paynes to ſeeke your pleaſure, and your

mind a thouſand torments to ſatisfie your deſire. When this deſire ſhall grow to his full height, it wil become low, & loue neuer leaues encreaſing till in the end it proue ſtarke madnes.
            Let vs therefore prouide our ſelues of ſtrong rampires and bulwarkes to warde vs againſt this paſſion, and let vs take heede that we bee not coſoned or deceiued with her entiſing baits. The more ſhe dallieth with vs, the more let vs defie her, and let vs take this warning in good time, that ſhe neuer comes to embrace vs, but ſhe meanes to ſtrangle vs: that ſhe neuer giues vs liberty and licenſe, but to bring vs into thraldome and ſlauerie: ſhe baites vs with honie, to glut vs with gall: ſhe ſetteth before our eyes a vaine

ſhew of pleaſure, which paſſeth away in a moment, and leaues vs ſorrow and griefe which remaineth for euer. Let vs therefore order our mindes in ſuch ſort, that in conſidering the excellencie of beautie, we doe acknowledge the cunning workmanſhip of nature, and let vs ſo eſteeme it as wee doe the Sunne and Moone, for the excellency which is contained within them. And if the law doe grant vs any more particular fruition of it, let it bee taken to that end that nature deſires, and ſo that we doe not loſe the vſe of reaſon which ought ſtill to beare rule in vs; remembring alwaies how much harme commeth by the immoderate vſe of this pleaſure; how it waſteth the bodie, weakeneth the ſoule, and duls the ſpirit. Let vs

altogether abſtaine from it (if it be poſſible) before wee bee married: for beſides that, it wipes away all ſhame and modeſtie in youth, it makes them loſe the ſweetneſſe of marriage which they 
                  •
               lone doe taſte which haue not vſed it before, a ſweetnes which ſouldereth and knitteth together the friendſhip of marriage: and ouer and beſides all theſe inconueniences before mentioned, it nouriſheth vs in the libertie and licenſe of an vnruly and inconſtant loue. But aboue all things let vs take heede that wee doe not commit any diſhoneſtie the ſooner to accompliſh our filthie pleaſures. Let vs repreſent vnto our ſelues the manifolde dangers which haue befallen thē which haue bin too deeply plunged in them, how ſome haue loſt

their goods, others their liues, others their mindes and wits. Againe, let vs on the contrary ſide conſider how much more pleaſure it will bee to vs to reſiſt and conquer pleaſure, then to poſſeſſe it; and how much more praiſe and commendation of all poſterities hath Alexander deſerued by his continencie, then Darius wife and her daughters purchaſed by their exceeding pleaſant & beautifull faces. Cleopatras eyes triumphed ouer C
                     •
                  ſar and Anthonie, but Auguſtus eyes did triumph ouer Cleopatras.
            
            Laſt of all, this kind of pleaſure is accompanied with a kinde of delight which concernes the bodie, and in this regarde it ſeemeth that it is ſomewhat naturall: but the deſire of goods and honours,

and the pleaſure which men take in poſſeſſing of thē, is rooted altogether vpō a bare opiniō. I know not what he was that firſt beguiled vs in giuing of names, in calling that good which doth in no wiſe depend of vs: but this I am ſure that he hath faſtened our happines vnto a rotten cable, and anchored our felicitie vpō the brittle and vnſtable ſand. For what is there in the world ſo vncertaine and vnſure, as the poſſeſſion of ſuch goods as goe and come, ſlide and paſſe away as a torrent? And I may very well ſay as a torrent, for they make a noyſe at their comming vnto a man, are full of violence being poſſeſſed of him, and are indeede nothing els but troubles and griefes: it is long before they come, and when they are

come they ſtay not long with vs, but vaniſh away ſuddenly and in a moment, & when they are gone they leaue nothing behinde them in the bottome but dirt and filth.
            O riches, if men could bee ſo happie as to ſee the ruſt of cares and grie
                  •
               es which are ingendered in the hearts of men, by looking vpon the brightnes and glorie of your gold and ſiluer, doubtles they would then hate you as much as they doe now loue you. And truly thoſe which do loue you, I can ſay no more of them but this, that they haue one vertue in them, and that is this, to be very conſtant in concealing their griefes, for feare of diſcouering their ſhames: and were it lawfull for ſorro we freely to vtter her complaints againſt Fortune, think you that ſhe could

not anſwere the accuſation of ſo many men, as ſhe hath couſoned by giuing of them euils, vnder pretence and title of good things? Verely my opinion is, that ſhe
                  •
                would haue nothing els to ſay vnto them for her excuſe but this, that ſhe hath beſtowed them vpō none but ſuch as did heartely deſire them. Let vs then acknowledge riches to be as they are, that is, preſents of Fortune, which ſhe doth but lend vnto vs for a while: for goods that ordinarily happen vnto bad men, for goods which are not goods, but whē they haue gotten them good maſters: for good which oftentimes corrupt goods manners, but neuer amend the bad: for goods without the which ſo many wiſe men haue made their liues moſt fortunate:

for goods which ſo many wicked men hauing had, haue ſuffered moſt pitifull deaths. Let vs know what this vnruly deſire of hauing them doth profit vs. It is a gangrene in our ſoules, which conſumeth our naturall affections with her venemous heate, to fill vs with certaine poyſoned and virulent humours. As ſoone as it is lodged within our hearts, all honeſtie and natural affection which is due vnto parents, friends, & to our ſelues, vaniſheth away: all the reſt being compared with our profits, ſeeme nothing: we, euen we for our profits ſake neglect our ſelues, & deſpiſe our mindes and bodies, and as it is in the prouerbe, ſell the horſe to buy hay. It ſeemes that nature in the very growing of gold, hath in ſome ſort preſaged

their miſeries which ſhould bee earneſt louers of it. For ſhe hath made that in thoſe parts where it groweth nothing proſpereth, neither hearbes, nor plants, nor any thing els which is of any value; 
                  •
               s it were foretelling vs that in the ſpirits of thoſe men in whom the deſire of this mettall ſhould rule, there ſhould bee left no ſparkle of honour or vertue.
            Let vs therfore chaſe away this 
                  •
               urious deſire farre from vs, and leauing the fooliſh opinions of the vulgar ſort of people which poizeth goods in goldſmiths balances, let vs follow the will & counſell of Nature which meaſureth them with the ell of neceſsitie. We ſhall learne of her, that our good cōmeth not from riches, no more then the heate which we 
                  •
               eele may

bee ſayd to come from our garments; but iſſuing from vs is kept & preſerued in them. That which cannot reach ſo farre as them, may be ſayd to be within vs: and ſo our vertue, though Fortune clippe her wings, ſhall not be leſſened thereby: for though it haue leſſe motion, yet ſhal it haue more reſt and contentment. There bee ſome notwithſtanding, which would faine corrupt vs with their vaine and fooliſh opinions, going about to perſwade vs to think vpon nothing els but vpon getting of riches. For what ſay they? If I doe not take care in time to get riches, how ſhall I bee able hereafter to help my friends, or ſerue my countrie? But let vs ſhape them this wiſe anſwere: that it is meete that euery one ſhould ſerue the Commonwealth

in his ſeuerall trade and vocation. It is the Philoſophers dutie to make his fellow citizens modeſt and obedient: if he doe ſo, it may be truly ſayd that he hath diſcharged his dutie, and pro
               
                  •
               ited both his friends and country. Beſides all this, I would ſay thus vnto him: ſet me down any honeſt courſe of getting riches, and I wil not refuſe to take it: for my part as I doe not greatly deſire them, ſo I would not refuſe any honeſt meanes and paines to get them. Now if you cannot ſhew me this honeſt meanes, why are you ſo inſtant with me to ſeeke them by vnlawfull meanes? Let vs learne to ſeeke that without paſſiō which nature deſires, and we ſhall finde that Fortune cannot hinder vs from atchieuing our purpoſes. But

indeed the ſpeedieſt & trueſt way of attaining vnto riches, is by deſpiſing of riches. If we would faine be rich, we neede not encreaſe the meanes of getting them, but rather diminiſh the deſires of ſeeking them: hee that is a contented man, is a rich man, hee may haue riches when he will. Thus Bias made himſelfe rich by 
                  •
               orſaking his goods which hee might haue carried with him out o
                  •
                the citie as well as the reſt, (becauſe this was one of the conditions in yeelding vp the towne into the enemies hands for in ſaying that hee carried all his goods with him, doubtles hee meant his vertues. Thus Diogenes grew not onely to bee ri
                  •
               h and mightie, but richer and mightier then Alexander, when he refuſed his largeſſe, and

in recompence of former curteſies asked onely this boone at his hand, that it would pleaſe him to ſtand a little further from him: (for at that time hee ſtood betweene him and the Sunne) and truly as Alexander dealt with `Diogenes: ſo do
                  •
                they deale with vs which preſent vs with the goods of Fortune: for they doe cleane take from vs the gifts of Nature. And this appeareth moſt manifeſtly in them which ſuffered themſelues to bee allured with the pleaſant baites of honors (as we call them) and to bee toſſed about with the wind of ambition. For forthwith they finde, that in ſtead of light and brightnes they haue nothing left them but ſmoke.
            Indeede true honour is the glittering & beaming brightnes of a

good and vertuous action, which rebounds from our conſciences vnto the ſight of them with whom wee liue, and ſo by a reflexion in our ſelues, brings vs a teſtimonie from others of the good opinion which they haue of vs, which makes vs to enioy great comfort of minde. Now this good dooth wholly depend on vs. Nature procures vs this good, when, and as often as wee will haue it, wee may haue it. But if wee once forſake it, wee doe but embrace a ſhadowe in ſtead of a bodie, and faſten the reſt of our minds vpon the opiniō of the vulgar ſort of people, and ſo voluntarily renounce our liberties, to ſerue the humours and paſſions of other men, and are compelled to diſpleaſe our ſelues to pleaſe them which doe behold vs:

ſo that our affections are hanged vpon the eyes of other men: and wee loue not vertue, but as the common people doe loue and fauour it: if wee chance to attempt or doe any good thing, it is not done for the loue of good, but for deſire of honour. And ſo wee become like pearced hogges-heads which ſuffer no licour to come foorth, till there bee a vent made. But what bounds hath this paſſion? how is it limited and confined? Doth age waſte it? No
                  •
                Doe dignities and honours content it? No. It is a gulfe which hath neither ſhore nor bottome. No, no, it is that vacuum which the Philoſophers could neuer yet finde, it is a fire which daily increaſeth being daily fed and nouriſhed. They which would ſmooth and flatter

ambition, would faine make men beleeue that ſhee is in ſtead of a ſtaire for vertue to mount vp to the top of honour: for, ſay they, for ambition ſake men leaue all other vices, and in fine forſake ambition too for the loue of vertue. But ſtay, this is not true: if ambition couer and hide all other vices, yet ſhe doth not take them away for all that, but ſuffers them to lurke for a time vnder the craftie aſhes of a malicious and fained diſſimulation, hoping that they ſhall haue the opportunitie hereafter to break foorth into a flame, when they ſhal get credit enough to raigne & rage publikely where they will with impunitie.
            Serpents loſe not their venome being benummed with cold, neither doe ambitious men forſake

their vices, whileſt they couer thē with the cold of diſsimulation: for when it is come to the place whither ſhe deſires to goe, then ſhe diſplayeth her force & makes men feele her ſtrength. And were it ſo that ambition ſhould abandon all other vices, yet would ſhe neuer leaue her ſelfe, being onely in this one thing iuſt, that ſhe ſufficeth to her owne puniſhment, and willingly offer
                  •
               th vp her ſelfe vnto torment. The motion of her deſires is like vnto the wheele of Ixion, it is turned vp and downe continually, and neuer ſuffers a mans minde to reſt quietly. Let vs therefore fortifie and ſtabliſh our minds againſt theſe grieuous motions which ſo much diſeaſe our quiet reſt and repoſe. 
                  •
               et vs ſo gouerne our affectiōs, that the luſter

of honours doe not dazle or darken the eyes of reaſon, and let vs plant certaine noble reſolutions in our minds in ſtead of bars and barricadoes againſt the furious aſſaults of ambition. Firſt of all let vs perſwade our ſelues that there is no true honor in the world but that which commeth from vertue. Secondly, that vertue ſeeks no greater or ampler theater to ſhew her ſelfe in, then her owne conſcience. The higher the Sunne is the leſſe ſhadow it makes, and the greater a mans vertue is the leſſe glorie it ſeekes. And indeed a man may very well liken glorie vnto a ſhadowe, for it followes them which flye from it, and flyes them that ſeek after it. Let vs conſider that we come into the world as to a comedie, where wee may

not chuſe what part we will play, but onely looke that we play that parte well which is giuen vs in charge. If the Poet bid vs play a kings part, we muſt take care that we doe it well, and ſo if he charge vs with the porter or clowns part, we muſt do it likewiſe: for a man may get as much credit by playing the one wel, as by well acting the other: and like diſcredit redoundeth vnto him if neither bee done well.
            As for diſhonours, we muſt vſe them as wee doe meates at a banquet, where wee taſte of them which are ſet before vs, but account it an vnmannerly part to reach our hands after thoſe diſhes which are ſet at the further end of the table, or to take the platters out of the ſtewards hands. And ſo

we, if the teſtimonie of our vertue, profit of our countrie, and fauour of our friends commit any matter of weight and credit to vs for to be done, which we know wee are well able to bring to paſſe, let vs accept it modeſtly, and diſcharge it faithfully and truly, thinking it to be Gods will and pleaſure that we ſhould watch and ward, whileſt others take their quiet reſt and ſleepe. Let not vs ſeeke any other recompence of our labours, but the conſcience of well doing, and let vs rather couet to haue the teſtimony of our vertues in grauen in the minds and hearts of our fellow citizens, then on the top of pillers or publike ſtatues: for many times it is a greater honour for a man not to haue that which hee deſerueth, then to haue it. I account

it (ſaid Cat
                     •
                  ) more honour to me that men ſhould aske why there were no images erected in honor of me, in this or that place, then if they ſhould aske why theſe images were erected, to what ende, or for what cauſe. To bee ſhort, let vs hold this for a maxime, that the fruit of noble actions is to bee ſayd to haue performed them moſt nobly, and that vertue cannot finde out of her ſelfe any recompence ſufficient to guerdon her ſelfe withall. For without doubt, ambition is a moſt gentle paſsion, which diues moſt gently downe into the moſt gentle manlike and heroical ſpirits: but being there, is not to bee drawne out againe but with great paine. Wee thinke that euery man is bound to ſeeke and follow after good,

and amongſt thereſt wee reckon honour to bee one of the chiefeſt, nay more to be accounted of then all the reſt.
            See here the cauſe why men ſhould take ſuch pains to ride and runne, to labour and trauell ſo earneſtly and vehemently as they do, and yet for all this, I can aſſure you that the other paſſions which are within vs, which grow in vs by apprehēſion of the obiect of ſome apparant euill, which wee are to ſhunne and auoyd, doe ſinke deeper into our hearts, and are hardly to be taken out of them. As namely 
                  •
               eare, which is an apprehenſion of ſome euill to come, which keepeth vs continually in a bodilie feare, and preuenteth the euils which Fortune threatneth & menaceth vs withall. For certainly it

is one of the cruelleſt inſtruments which opinion hath to torment vs withall: for becauſe ſhe cannot worke vpon vs, but by coſoning and beguiling vs, and that euery man can better ſee things preſent, then foreſee things to come: therfore ſhe ſerues her ſelf with things to come, the ſooner to come to her purpoſes, ſhe lieth lurking in ſome darke or blinde corner, to 
                  •
               atch her time and opportunitie, as theeues obſerue the night for their robberies, becauſe ſhe would not be diſcouered in her actions. Afterwards ſhe feares & affrights vs with maskes of euils, which haue but a bare ſhew and apparance of euill, hauing nothing in her which may hurt vs, but the apprehenſion of a conceiued and imaginarie euil, which maketh the

thing ſeeme euill, though it be not ſo indeede, and euen from that which is good draweth a kinde of euill to vexe and trouble vs withall. And good God, how many men may we ſee continually, who for feare of beeing vnfortunate haue become miſerable, and ſo turned their vaine feares into certaine miſeries? How many men are there in the world which haue loſt their friends for feare of diſtruſting them? and how manie haue been ſicke for feare of being ſicke? ſo that it may be truly ſaid, that feare is a heauy weight, which maketh vs ſtoope downe to the ground, and ſtumble as we runne haſtily from that which we thinke is to be auoyded. Therefore let vs take awayfeare, and we ſhall remoue al danger of euill farre from

vs: at leaſt wee ſhall not feele it before it come, and when it comes it will neuer trouble vs ſo much, that we need greatly to feare it.
            If a man might haue his mind to chuſe from what euil he would bee exempted, in mine opinion hee ſhould chooſe to bee freeſt from feare: becauſe the paine of other euils dureth no longer then the cauſe, but feare is formed indifferently as well of that which is, as of that which is not, & which peraduenture is neuer likely to be; yea of 
                  〈◊〉
                which cannot be at all. O what a cra
                  •
               tie and ſubtill paſſion is this, which can out of an imagined euill draw 
                  •
               oorth ſuch a true and liuely griefe? Thus he inueigled the painter Parrhaſus, to torment ſome of his ſeruants, that he might the better bee able to imitate

and expreſſe the lamentable and ſorrowfull paſſions of the fabulous Prometheus. Now tell me why ſhould we be ſo ambitious in ſeeking our owne harmes, as once to runne to meete and preuent them with our thoughts and meditations? Nay rather on Gods name, let vs ſtay til they come, but neuer make any great looking after them, and it may bee they will not come ſo farre as to vs. There bee a thouſand lets and hinderances (which cannot bee foreſeene) to ward the blow from vs, which we feare is comming vpon vs. For euen our feares are as eaſily beguiled as are our hopes. But alas, what is there to bee feared? Feare we that which is in our power or no? No: for then perhaps wee might remedie it. What then? is

it a thing out of our power? If it be ſo, it is no euill, and what cauſe then haue wee to feare it? Wherefore ſerues this feare then? Mary it ſerues for a voluntarie puniſhment to vexe our ſelues withall. On the contrary ſide, if wee can but beare a braue minde and reſolute courage agaynſt this paſſion, we ſhall bee well able to remedie and redreſſe many things which happen vnto vs, which by feare and aſtoniſhment are made farre worſe then they are: but amongſt many other euill effects which feare bringeth with it, this is one moſt dangerous, that ordinarily it maketh a mā to hate that which he feares.
            Now hatred is a moſt deadlie paſſion, which troubleth vs very ſtrangely. For I pray, ſtay a while

and conſider with your ſelues how when wee meane to hate a thing indeed, this affection of hatred is nouriſhed and increaſed within vs, though it bee neither watered nor laboured, and finally how it cauſeth in vs an vtter loathing and deteſtation of that which is hated. And what is that which we doe ſo greatly hate and abhorre? Mary that you may bee ſure which wee ſhould not: for if there bee any thing in the world which deſerues to be hated, it is hatred it ſelfe, and ſuch like paſſions which are contrarie to the nature of that which ſhould commaund in vs. This is the onely griefe in the worlde to vexe vs withall. We hate the perſons themſelues, and we hate their actions, either becauſe wee feare ſome euill to come, or remember

ſome euill paſt which we haue receiued by them, or els becauſe the nature of our ſences hath a kinde of contrarietie, antipathie, or contrepaſsion with the thing hated. And is there any thing that can trouble vs more then this? By this paſſion we
                  •
                bring our ſelues into the power of that which we hate, to vexe and trouble vs as it liſteth. Firſt 
                  •
               ight moues ſence, then remembrance wakeneth the ſpirit, and ſo whether we be waking or ſleeping, wee repreſent the thing hated vnto our ſelues, with a kind of deſpite and gnaſhing of teeth, which brings vs cleane out of order, carrieth vs out of our ſelues, & rents our hearts in peeces moſt pitifully. Whereby it ſo commeth to paſſe, that the paine of that euil which we doe wiſh vnto another

man, doth 
                  •
               al vpō our own heads. Wherefore let vs ſhut the gate of our ſoule againſt this great & terrible paſſion: and to take away all pretence of entring in vpon vs, by a miſlike and lothing of thinges which may come into our imaginatiō, let vs propoūd to our ſelues this rule which is moſt true and infallible, to wit, that euery thing hath two handles, by the which a man may take and lift it vp: if we take it by one of the handles it wil ſeeme heauie and grieuous: if by the other, wee ſhall finde it light and 
                  •
               aſie to be borne. Now nature may ſpeake vnto vs, as the Philoſopher did vnto his ſchollers; that which I offer vnto you with the right hand, you take with the left, you alwaies chooſe the worſt; if there be any good thing

you leaue it, and if there bee any bad thing that you will bee ſure to take. For example, there is one of your neighbours which ſueth you in the law, and therefore you can not thinke on him, but you muſt dreame of his proceſſe, and conſequently curſe and blame him therfore. See here the bad handle, for take him by the other handle, and then ſtraight waies you will thinke that he is a man as well as you, & that God hath bound you to loue him by a likenes of nature, that he is your fellow citizen, and that you are ioyned together in a communitie of the ſame lawes, the ſame Churches, the ſame Altars, and the ſelfe ſame ſacrifices: againe, that you are fellow neighbours, bound by charitie to ſuccour and relieue one another, and

ſhall not ſo many ſubiects of good will bee able to quench one little ſparke of hatred? Peraduenture you haue a brother which hath offended you, and if you chaunce to meditate on him, you thinke and meditate on him that hath offended you, and not on him which was cōceiued in the ſame wombe, that ſucked the ſame breaſts, was brought vp in the ſame houſe, and laſtly that hee is the one halfe of you. Let vs learne then to handle things rightly, to take them by the good handle, and ſo we ſhall find that there is ſomewhat or other to be loued in that which is now hated of vs. For certainly there is nothing in the worlde which is not created for mans good. If there be any vicious thing in it which wee do hate, it is the euill of the vicious

perſon himſelfe, and not ours. If happily hee offend vs, wee haue more cauſe to pitie and lament his caſe, then to hate and abhorre him. For he himſelf is the firſt that is offended, and receiueth moſt harme therby: for by this meanes he commeth to loſe thevſe of reaſon, and what greater harme can there happen vnto a man in this world? Wherefore in ſuch & the like caſes, let vs turne our hatred into pitie, and ſtudie to make thē worthie of our loues which wee would ſo 
                  •
               aine hate. Thus dealt Licurgus when euery one forſook the companie of a certaine fellow which had thruſt out one of his eyes, hee abandoned not his companie, but carried him home with him, gently entreated him, and enioyned him no other puniſhment

but this, that he ſhould ſtudie more earneſtly to bee ſoberly and vertuouſly brought vp: which being done, hee returned him to his fellowe citizens, which found that whereas he before was a very quarrellous and iniurious fellow, now he was become a good, honeſt, and ſober citizen.
            And looke as we ought to ſhun hatred, ſo likewiſe muſt we auoyd enuie: for they are ſiſters germaine of the ſame colour, and the ſame port, and both of them haue effects equally daungerous. Enuie ſtirreth vp within vs a kind of ſorrow at the good which other men enioy, which ſtill lieth gnawing at our hearts, and tormenteth vs moſt cruelly. Indeede it is a cruel paſſion, and ſo cruell, that all the torments of the moſt cunning

and exquiſite and profeſſed tyrants in the worlde, could neuer haue found out a greater. For ſeeing it is of power to conuert and turne another mans good into her harme, what limits can there bee preſcribed vnto her torments, when both her owne euils and other mens goods ſhal ioyne together to torment and trouble her? Let vs therefore runne away from her as wee would doe from ſome wilde beaſt, which neuer ceaſeth to deuoure and gnaw our hearts, and ſeeke vtterly to depriue vs of any good that ſhall happen vnto vs. Whileſt the enuious man looketh wiſtly and ouerth wartly ouer another mans good, he letteth his owne be ſpoyled, and ſo loſeth the pleaſure thereof. Now the readie way to take away the feare of this

enuie, will be to ponder and conſider with our ſelues what is that which wee eſteeme good, and enuie another man the hauing: and we ſhal find, that all being put together, yet there is nothing which wee would willinglie haue our ſelues. For I finde that the things which commonly we enuie other men the hauing, are theſe: riches, honours, and fauours: but if a man ſhould ſpeake thus vnto vs, I am content that you ſhould haue as much as they at the ſame rate, I warrant you wee would ſtraight waies anſwer that we would haue none of them. For if wee would haue them as they haue them, wee muſt flatter and coſen as they do, ſuffer many iniuries, and needes loſe our libertie. For as the world goeth now, there is nothing to be

gotten for bare nothing. Perhaps you make profeſſion of honor and vertue: wel this cannot be bought but with the loſſe of other things which are gotten by a modeſt and ſhamefaſt kinde of patience. Riches, dignities and fauours are beſtowed on them onely which can tell how to ſooth men vp in their humours, and apply themſelues vnto their pleaſures and affectiōs. This is a law, or at leaſtwiſe the cuſtome of the world, and it was a cuſtome before euer you were borne, and therefore why doth it grieue you to ſee it obſerued? This man ſels his libertie and freedome to receiue the price of an office or dignitie: why do you enuie thereat, for I am ſure you would not ſel yours to gain as much: you would faine haue ſiluer and cloath and

ſuch like thinges which this man exchaungeth for his libertie, and yet you would keepe yours: but you may not doe ſo, the law of nations is againſt it, either you muſt be content with your ware, or els with the price. I goe to the market, and there I ſee one open his purſe and deliuer out a peny, and 
                  •
               ee carrieth away with him a lettiſe, or ſome ſuch thing: I which giue nothing carry nothing home with me, and yet I thinke my ſelfe as good a man as he euery day of the weeke. For loe here is all the difference, he hath his lettiſe, and I haue my mony. I eſpie my neighbour comming from a feaſt; when I conſider onely the good cheare which hath been made him, I ſhall be ſorrie that I was not there with him: but when I think how a man

muſt flatter the maſter of the houſe, if he will be welcome, I had rather neuer haue good cheare, then at any time to neglect the dutie of an honeſt man. Let vs therefore, as we tender our reſt and quietnes in this world, take heede that wee grow not too enuious of another mans good. For if it be a true good which hath happened vnto him, we ſhould rather reioyce and bee glad with him for it: for euery mā ſhould deſire the good one of an other; and to reioyce at the good of another is the way to encreaſe a mans owne.
            The very ſame rules are to bee obſerued concerning i
                  •
               louſie: for it is as like it in nature and effect as may bee; vnles this bee the difference, that in reſpect of enuie wee conſider not good, but when it is

come vnto another man which wee deſire to haue our ſelues: but iealouſie is of our owne proper good, when wee feare leaſt another man ſhould haue part with vs. But verely it is a ſottiſh and irkſome paſſiō, it is the gall which maketh bitter the honey-ſweet of our life: for it is ordinarily ſeene in our pleaſanteſt & ſweeteſt actions which it maketh ſo bitter and ſharp
                  •
               , as nothing can bee more: for it chaungeth loue into hatred, reſpect into diſdaine, and certaintie into diſtruſt. Make this account with your ſelfe, that whoſoeuer meanes to leade a ielous life, muſt leade a miſerable life. The onely meanes of ſhunning and auoyding it, is to make a man worthie of that which is deſired: for iealouſie is nothing els but a diſtruſt

of a mansſelfe, and a bearing witnes of himſelfe againſt himſel

               e of his ſmall deſeruings. In my opinion, it was a very worthie anſwer which the Emperour

            The preſumption and confidence of our owne worthines, is a great pledge to aſſure vs of another

mans goodwill: for hee that 
                  •
               eeketh a thing with a vertuous intent, is glad to haue a companion ioyned with him in the purſuite thereof: for he may ſerue to prouoke his dulnes, and ſuccour his weaknes and imbecillitie, in purſuing of that which is good, becauſe of the ſhining glorie & honour of the others eſtate. Onely weaknes feares to be encountred, becauſe ſhe is afraid, yt being compared with another, ſhe ſhall by and by ſhew foorth her imperfection. Who is he that would if hee might ſport himſelfe alone at the games of Olympus? Take away emulation, and take away glorie, and take away the very ſpurre of vertue. It is a ſtraunge thing, that accordingly as we are diſpoſed to vſe and receiue the things which

happen vnto other men, ſo they ſerue vs either to a good vſe or to a had vſe: for marke, if the good of another man doe not breed ielouſie within vs, and keep vs in a continuall feare and perplexitie. Againe on the other ſide, how another mans euill doth cauſe a kinde of remorſe and piti

                  ••
                euidently, in that the things which diſpleaſe vs moſt are made pleaſant and ſweete by cuſtome and continuance. The

gally ſlaues when they goe to ſea, weepe at firſt ſhipping, but after three or foure moneths they ſing as merrily as birds. So that you ſee cuſtome is al: for they which haue not been accuſtomed to the ſea, are afraid and looke pale when they ſee them weigh anchors and lanch foorth into the ſea, though it be in a calme: where contrarily the old and tried marriners laugh and are merrie in a tempeſt. And looke what good cuſtome bringeth vnto the common ſort of people, the ſame meditation bringeth vnto a Philoſopher: for by often thinking and meditating vpon things, hee maketh them ſeeme moſt familia

moleſt and trouble vs, and let vs caſt before hand the worſt that maye happen; as ſickneſſe, pouertie, baniſhment and iniuries, and let them ſift them narrowly to finde out the nature of them, or els that which is moſt contrarie vnto their natures.

A mans bodie is ſick and diſeaſed: no great maruel, for ſeeing it is a compound thing, therefore it is ſubiect vnto alteration. Yea ſir, it is true, as you ſay: but yet for all that the griefe of the diſeaſe is felt ſo violently, that it makes vs cry out in ſpight of our teeth. I grant indeed that it is felt, I muſt needes confeſſe that, but it is felt onely in bodie, and it makes vs crie too and if we wil be ſo fooliſh. Griefe is not intollerable, but

                  •
               r I ſhould ſay that you are euill: and ſo hee went forwarde with his diſcourſe, and made as if he had neuer felt it. Now I pray tell me and if you can, what new remedies had this Philoſopher found out againſt this griefe? what plaiſters and oyntments had hee

ſtored vp againſt the gowt? Truly theſe two, the knowledge of things, and courage of minde. For he was thorowly reſolued, that the body was made to ſerue the ſoule, and that if ſo be the ſoule ſhould be grieued for that which happened vnto the bodie, that then it muſt 
                  •
               f force bee ſubiect to the bodie. Now if it ought not to bee troubled for that which happeneth vnto the bodie, how much leſſe ought ſhe to bee grieued for the loſſe of goods? For the loſſe of a mans goods dooth not touch a man ſo neere as the want of his health. Indeed both of them are things meerely without vs, yet of the two the bodie is neerer vnto vs then goods.
            Man commeth naked into the world, and ſhall goe naked out of

of mind. If you employ them to ſome vſe, why then they are not loſt: if you doe not employ them, then you loſe both your goods and your mindes both together. Would you therefore faine know an eaſie way to cure you of theſe wounds? I will ſhew you it preſently; look vpon the skarres and wounds which other men of good account & great reſolution haue receiued: and conſider how they haue laught at ſuch loſſes, and taken occaſion to thanke God for them. Hearken what Z

                  no ſayd, that at that time when he ſuffered ſhip wracke, the windes blew very luckely: for they brought him vnto the hauen of Philoſophie, where he beſtowed the remainder of his life in a moſt quiet and peaceable Sun-ſhine, amidſt the tempeſts of

ciuill diſcorde, and had a ſafe couert to defend him from a thouſand ſcorching griefs, which trouble and torment men in the affayres of this world.
            Doe you know how to ſuffer loſſe of things ſo that it ſhall not trouble you? It is quickly learned, there is no more in it but this, not to accuſtome your ſelfe to loue any thing otherwiſe then it is, or better then it deſerueth. If a man haue an earthē veſſell, let him loue it as a veſſell of earth, which may beebroken, and ſo if it chance to be broken, the matter will neuer trouble him much. Let vs paſſe from ſmaller thinges to greater things, from vile and baſer things to things of greater value & more account, and let vs doe the like. If wee loue our children, let vs loue

the
                  •
                as men, that is to ſay, as men ſubiect vnto infinit caſualties of death, and then afterwards when they happen to dye, their deaths will be neither ſtraunge nor grieuous vnto vs.
            Indeed it is an imagination and opinion that vexeth and tormenteth vs more then the things themſelues, which is formed of thoſe words which a man vſeth when he is ſurpriſed with ſuch accidēts: for we call one thing by the name of another, and imagine it to bee like vnto that other, & the image and Idea thereof remaineth ſo in our mindes. And therefore let vs mollifie and ſweeten our words as well as we can: for if one of our children chaunce to dye, ſay not I haue loſt one of my children: but this, I haue reſtored one of my

children to God, of whom I borrowed them. And likewiſe if wee loſe any other of our goods, let vs vſe the like wordes. If a naughtie fellow take away our goods from vs, and it grieues vs at the verie heart, ſay no more but this: Was it not meet that God ſhould haue that againe which he had lent me for a time? For the reſt, remember your own opinion of the like miſhaps when they did happen vnto others
                  •
                and conſider with your ſelf how thē you were not much moued, but rather how you did blame them, and neglect their friuolous and vaine complaints. Suppoſe that the iudgement which you giue of them, is a preiudice againſt your ſelfe which cannot be auoyded. For our iudgements in another mans behalf are alwaies more

iuſt and fauourable, thē in a mans owne cauſe. If a ſeruant of your neighbours chaunce to breake a glaſſe, you ſay, there is no great harme done, it was but a glaſſe broken. If his ſonne dye, you ſay, he was of eſtate mortall, not borne to liue euer: and I pray why can you not ſay as much when your owne ſonne dyeth, without crying out, tormenting your ſelfe, or accuſing God and men for the loſſe of that which is ſo ordinarie? There happeneth nothing vnto you but that which you haue foreſeene and thought on a thouſand times: and wherfore then are you ſo much aſtoniſhed? For verely I am perſwaded, that if wee were as prouident and careful as we ought to be, and may be if we will, wee ſhall little neede to bee afraide or

troubled when any thing happeneth, and principally wee ſhould not greatly care for that which we call iniurie. For let vs but ſet before the eyes of our mindes the manners and humours of men, with whom we doe conuerſe, (as they are for the moſt part) and we ſhall bee quickly reſolued, I warrant you, to ſuffer many lewd parts at their hands, and to indure much of their indiſcretion: for the common nature of men is to reioyce in euil doing, and to meaſure their authorities by nothing but by the iniuries and contempts of other men. So few there be that take pleaſure in well doing.
            Let vs therefore determine with our ſelues, that on what ſide ſo euer wee turne our ſelues, wee ſhall finde ſome or other that will bee

readie to offend vs, ſo that a man may finde, as many men ſo many iniuries. But let vs take heed that we be not ſurpriſed by them, ſtanding alwaies vpon our garde, and hauing due regarde vnto them when they come. So that whither ſo euer wee goe, and what buſines ſo euer we vndertake, let vs conſider before hand what the euent is likely for to be, and how we ſhall be entreated. If we bee deſirous to goe to the baths, let vs wiſely caſt with our ſelues before hand what the actions of men are when wee ſhall come thither, how one gapples and cryes, another iuſtles and iumbles his fellow, here one daſhing them with water, and there another readie to ſteale their garments. If wee haue well premeditated and forethought vpon all

this, wee ſhall doe nothing but laugh at matters when they happen. If we haue occaſion to viſite ſome great man, let vs imagine that hee will make vs wa
                  •
               te at his gate, and when we ſeeke to get in at the doore, the porter will ſhut vs out, and clap the doore againſt vs; that we ſhall finde him buſie, or in ſuch a caſe that hee will not bee ſpoken withall, or when all is done that he wil not giue vs good countenance, and ſcarſe bid vs welcome. When we haue debated all this with our ſelues, little cauſe ſhall we haue to be moued or troubled.
            Beſides all this, there is another thing which ſerueth greatly to ſweeten our iniuries, and that is whē we excuſe them in our ſelues which haue offered vs any iniurie,

preſuming that they would nor haue done it without ſome occaſion. For example, if you ſhould call to your ſeruant, and he not anſwere you againe, thinke that hee did not heare you wh
                  •
               n you called him
                  •
                he hath not been there whither you ſent him, ſuppoſe that hee was not at leiſure 
                  •
               o goethither: and thus let vs doe in other matters, fr
                  •
               ming ſtill excuſes vnto our ſelues in the behalfe of other men: but eſpecially in matters of iniuries, let vs ſerue our ſelues with the commodity which they offer vs. For as there is no kinde of hearbe how venemous ſo euer it bee, which being well tempered and ordered to the purpoſe, hath not ſome profitable vſe in it ſelfe: ſo is it in caſe of iniuries. We may (to ſpeake with the

leaſt) reape two commodities by them: the on
                  •
               , that they make vs know them which offer vs iniuries, to learne to take heede of thē againſt another time: the other, in that they diſcouer our weakenes and infirmitie, and the place which lyeth ſo open to the batt
                  •
               
               ri
                  •
               , that we may be the better able to fortifie and ſtrengthen it. In ſuch ſort that if you chance to ſee a man which ſpeakes ill of you, conclude by a
                  •
               d by with your ſelf; doubtles this man is an euil man, I may not truſt him at any hand. Thē examine whether that which he ſaith be true, either in whole or in part, and correct that fault in your ſelfe, leaſt happily another man take occaſion to ſpeake as much, or more of you. For I pray you, what better reuenge can a

man take of his enemies, then to profit by their iniuries? But indeede the laſt fence and ſtrongeſt rampier that we can haue againſt theſe or the like accidents is this, to be reſolued that we cannot receiue any harme but of our ſelues: and that if ſo be our reaſon be ſo well gouerned as it ought to bee, we cannot be wounded at al. And therefore wee may crye out with Socrates; Anitus and Melitus may put me to death, but they can not doe me any harme.
            Now he that is prepared to ſurfer the iniuries & rebukes of men, will not bee to ſeeke to beare the paine of baniſhment. For commonly it is allotted vnto honeſt and good men, by the iniurious dealings of the wicked. But becauſe it is but a vaine ſhew of euill,

where with opinion terrifieth our minds, and vſeth to draw forth the bitternes of griefe and ſorrow; let vs therefore conſider it more particularly, and try whether it be as grieuous vnto a man when he ſtands by it and viewes it more exactly, as it ſeemeth vnto him when he is a farre of. Who hath taught vs that it is the nature of man to ſtay ſtill in the ſame place? What greater diſpleaſure 
                  •
               ā there come vnto a man then to bee confined & limitted within certaine boūds? Looke vpon all the cities of the world, and obſerue the inhabitāts there dwelling, to ſee how many you can find which were townesborne children bred and brought vp in the ſame place; & I beleeue you ſhall finde, that the greateſt part of the inhabitants are voluntarie

exiles frō their natiue countrie. Euery place in the world is a wiſe mans countrie, or rather no place at all is his countrie. For his habitation is in heauen, whither hee aſpireth after hee hath paſſed the time here beneath of his ſorrowfull pilgrimage; making his abode in cities and prouinces, as trauailers do in Innes and oſtelries. Againe, we cannot ſee paſt ten or twelue leagues of ground: but the face of this great heauen gliſtering with ſo many faire and beautifull ſtarres, doth ſhew her ſelfe once a day, becauſe we ſhuld ſee her turne round about when ſhe diſplaieth her beautie to the full. Wherefore then ſhould it grieue vs ſo much to loſe the ſight of the place where we were borne? It was in ye power of our mothers

(and if they liſted) to haue been brought a bed in other places, and ſo to haue made vs changed our countries.
            This is a barre againſt all that may be obiected concerning this matter, that we were borne either here or there, it matters not where, and therefore we need not ſorrow ſo much at our baniſhments. Pompey ſeeing the effeminatenes of the Romanes mindes which were with him at the battaile of Pharſalia, and perceiuing how they turned their eyes & thoughts towards the citie of Rome, ſorrowfully regreeting their houſes, and ſighing as mē baniſhed from their countrie: My friends (quoth he) the countrie where good men dwell in, is their libertie. Rutilius declared this moſt manifeſtly vnto

               Sylla: for being by him ſent for back againe from baniſhment, he would not repayre vnto Rome, but rather endure the vaſues of a deſert and ſolitude of an Iland, rather then to abide the face of the tyrant in his owne citie. Euery country is fit to nouriſh and bring vp men, euery countrie yeeldeth them parents: for nature hath ioyned al of vs together in bloud and charitie: euery countrie bringeth foorth friends vnto vertue, for vertue is of power to make men loue one another. What then is there which may cauſe vs to grieue at our departure from the place of our naturall abode? for the ſame heauen hangs ſtill on our heads, and the ſelfe ſame elements continue. If we loſe not our courages, we ſhall not loſe any thing by our

baniſhments. Now if you can reſolue vpō that which I haue propounded vnto you, to auoyd theſe firſt paſſions well and good, I ſhal not neede to employ any further time to diſcourſe vnto you the way and means of preparing your ſelfe againſt the other. For if you neuer receiue into your minde thoſe paſſions which grow in the concupiſcible part of the ſoule, you ſhall neuer be vexed with thē which are formed in the iraſcible part. For as much as theſe, which are deſpayre, and hope, feare, and choler neuer riſe and ſtirre in ou
                  •
                minds, but after deſire & loathing are ingendred within vs. And as the former (whereof we haue hetherto ſpoken) grow by an application of the obiect and opinio
                  •
                conceiued, that they wil be fauourable

or contrarie vnto vs: ſo theſe other ſpring from a conſideration and ſearch of the ſoule which it hath to obtaine or auoyde that which ſhe deſireth or flyeth. This is but as it were a mouing of the ſoule out of it ſelfe, which is cauſed by a redoubling of the former paſſion, and therefore as a fire better kindled they are hard to bee quenched: for in a moment they gain the greateſt part of the ſoule, and ſhake her ſtrongeſt paſſions. Now for a remedie to garde vs from them, let vs learne to call them all by their ſeuerall names, and knowe them by the liueries which they weare, made of certain terrible and grieuous accidents.
            For the firſt, which is hope, kindling our fooliſh deſires with a ſoft and pleaſant winde, cauſeth a certaine

fire in our hearts full of a thicke ſmoke which dazels our vnderſtanding, carrieth our cogitations away with violence, and holdeth them hanging in the clowdes, vtterly depriueth vs of iudgement, and maketh vs to dreame waking. And as long as our hopes dure, we cannot be perſwaded to forſake our deſires. On the contrary part, when deſpayre is once lodged within vs, it ſo tormenteth our ſoule with an opiniō of our diſabilitie in obtaining of that which wee deſire, that euerie thing muſt yeeld vnto her becke, and giue her place: ſo that for the very loue of that which wee imagine we ſhall neuer be able to attaine vnto, we forgo the quiet reſt which wee alreadie enioy. This paſſion is like vnto little children,

which for ſpight that one of their toyes ſhould be taken away from thē, throw al ye reſt in the fire. This paſſion is angrie with her ſelfe, and of her ſelfe exacteth the paine of her misfortune. The meanes to cure a man of it, is to arreſt his deſires at their firſt peeping forth, and if they bee wicked not to permit them to goe any further, and if they bee good to temper and make them goe and grow into a ſweete and peaceable affection, without looking afterwards for anymore fauour, then the nature of the thing and inconſtancie of Fortune doth ſuffer and permit: ſtill ballancing our hopes and feares together. For a wiſe man ought not to liue in hope more then in feare; and it is not his part to cō
               mit himſelfe into Fortunes hands,

to hinder or diminiſh any thing from his pleaſures. In like manner he ſhould not deſpayre or doubt of any thing, as well for that his deſires ſhould be bounded within the limits of his power, as alſo for that ſuch is the vnſteadfaſtnes of things, that it doth as well relieue things deſperate, as altogether ouerturne and quaile the hopes of things wiſhed for.
            Now for 
                  •
               eare, which is a violent trouble, whereby the ſoule being frighted retireth backe into her ſelfe, and there ſtayeth becauſe ſhe ſeeth not the meanes of auoyding the danger which is imminent ouer her head, it is a dangerous paſſion: for beſides the great diſcouragement which it bringeth vnto vs, it ſeaſeth vs with ſuch a kind of aſtoniſhment, that

wee haue no meanes of diſcourſe left vnto vs: yea euen at that time when our ſences are moſt quickeſt. For then our eyes are opened and yet wee can ſee nothing, men ſpeake and talke vnto vs, but wee heare them not, and when wee would runne away from the danger, wee haue not the power ſo much as to li
                  •
               t vp our legs. To ſay the trueth, it commeth vnto vs at the firſt by a diſpoſition of nature, but after wards delicate nouriture and fonde education, preuaileth much vnto the increaſing of it. For becauſe we were not nouriſhed and brought vp in the time of our youth vnto labour and paine, therefore wee begin to feare thoſe things which wee haue no reaſon to ſtand in feare of. Wherefore if wee meane to arme our ſelues againſt

theſe paſſions, wee muſt haue recourſe vnto Wiſedome, and by her good meanes we ſhall ſoone come to know the nature of things: which being knowne, it will euidently appeare, that there is nothing which ought to bee ſo much feared and dreaded of vs. For take but away the maske of opinion, and wee ſhall finde their natures altogether pure, friendly, and agreeable vnto vs. Moreouer, we muſt accuſtome our ſelues a long time before to the terribleſt and fearfulleſt things that are, and let vs ſet before our eyes the moſt gaſtly dangers which can fall vpō vs, and with ioy of heart ſometimes commit our ſelues vnto the moſt dang
                  •
               rous hazards
                  •
                for triall of our courages. To preuent a mans euill fortunes by running as

it were to meete them, is to take Fortunes weapons into our hands and wound our ſelues with them. Were it not better for vs to bee prouided before hand to withſtād her force when ſhe aſſaulteth vs, then vpon the ſudden to be put to our ſhifts to defend our ſelues? For if we doe ſo, wee ſhall be ſure to haue leiſure to put on our weapons
                  •
                to take our aduantages, and 
                  •
               oreſee a place where to retire if neede be: where on the co

               trarie ſide, if ſhe ſet on vs vpon the ſudden, ſhe may eaſily ſurpriſe vs, and deale with vs as ſhe liſt. And therfore it ſhall be good for vs before the aſſault, to try how we can defende our ſelues, to make many falſe alarmes, & propoſe vnto our ſelues the dangers which worthie men haue ſuffered in our remembrances:

how ſome haue eſcaped the greateſt, becauſe they would not bee daunted: and others haue been ouercome by the leaſt, becauſe they were not wel reſolued. But aboue all other things let vs ſo handle the matter, that wee doe not at anytime apprehend 
                  〈◊〉
                or the feare thereof when it commeth: for it is a common obiec
                  •
                which troubleth our minde, and deſtroyeth our iudgements, and maketh vs abandon al offices and duties, and finally it cauſeth vs to forget our ſelues.
            O that we could be once fullie perſwaded in this poynt not to feare death, good God how happie ſhould we then be? For in this one thing more then in any other, opinion taketh occaſion to band her ſelfe againſt reaſon, that ſo ſhe

might terrifie vs by wearing the vgly vizard of death. And albeit there bee but one death in all the world, yet ſhe painteth him foorth vnto vs after an infinite kinde of faſhions. Beleeue me there is nothing in death which is to be feared: but here is the miſchiefe, ſhe ſendeth foorth certaine fearefull and cowardly ſpies abroad, to ſpie what is done, which report not the trueth what they haue ſeene, but what they haue heard mē ſay, and which they themſelues feare is likely for to happen. Indeed we truſt too much vnto the ſayings of the vulgar ſort of people, which are moſt inconſiderate, affirming it to be a great euill, and yeeld no credite vnto Phil

After ſhe had opened her breaſt with the firſt wound, and made a broad paſſage for death to come in at, ſhe ſayd vnto Pet

                  ; O Petus, death is not grieuous vnto me. She ſayd this vnto him which well vnderſtood that death was not euill, but the end of all euils to that man which was ſeaſed with her. For how ſhould ſhe bee euill being naturall

But reaſon which ſhould command in vs, will haue no ſuch officers which do al things of their owne heads, without ſtaying for any direction: ſhe deſireth to doe all things orderly and lawfully, as

well as nature. And becauſe it is not her propertie to vſe violence, therefore wee oftentimes thinke that where there is violence there is ſtrength. But alas wee deceiue our ſelues: for there is nothing ſo weake as an vnruly and diſordered motion. Now all violent motions proceede rather from weaknes then from ſtrength: and may bee well reſembled vnto the force of young children and old folkes, which runne when they thinke they doe but walke and goe about. For truſt me, anger and choler is but an argument of weakenes, and they are much deceiued that thinke otherwiſe. But what then, may ſome man ſay, ſhall vertue ſee vice waxe inſolent, and yet not bee mooued at all? ſhall wee take away all manner of libertie

from them, ſo that they ſhall not haue ſo much leaue as to ſhewe foorth their anger againſt the wicked? For anſwere to this I ſay, that vertue deſireth no more libertie then it is fit and meete for her to haue; ſhee maye not turne her ſtrength againſt her ſelfe, or bee any thing mooued with another mans euill. For it is the propertie of a wiſe man as well to ſuffer the vices of euill men without choler, as to brooke their proſperities without enuie: and he muſt be as readie patiently to ſuffer the indiſcreete parts of many raſh headed perſons, as the Phiſition can bee content many times to beare many iniuries at his patients hands, being ſicke of a phrenſie.
            Truly there is no greater wiſedome, nor more profitable in this

world, then patience in enduring the follie of other men. For otherwiſe it ſo falleth out diuers times, that becauſe wee cannot ſuffer their fooliſhnes, wee make it become ours, and ſoreceiue much harme thereby. For firſt it makes vs loſe our iudgemēts, then it cauſeth vs to hurt our ſelues, till in the end we throw our ſelues headlong into that danger which we would willingly auoyd. This paſſion alſo may be very well and fitly likened vnto great walles or houſes when they fall, which breake and bruſe all that they light vpon: and ſhe is ſo earneſt in procuring another mans euill, that ſhe hath no reſpect at all vnto her owne good. Adde vnto all this that hath been ſpoken, that ſhe is very inconſiderate, and for the moſt part vniuſt:

and to ſpeake the trueth, offence and reuenge is but one ſinne, that hath diuers excuſes: for both of them haue one end, and that is to miſchiefe other men. Therefore let vs be diligent and careful, that wee doe not ſuffer any ſuch paſſions to ariſe in our minds: but as ſoone as any thing doth begin to moue vs any whit, or touch vs to the quicke, let vs pauſe and thinke vpon it a while: for if wee could but once find in our hearts to reaſon the caſe with our ſelues, wee ſhould be well able to ſtoppe the courſe of this cruell feuer of the minde. For looke but vpon the actions and geſtures of men when they are once in choler, marke how ill euery thing becommeth them. Contra
                  •
               ily, let vs recount with our ſelues the fruite of clemenci
                  •
               
               
and gentlenes, how it maketh vs ſeeme gratious and acceptable to others, and profitable or commodious vnto our ſelues. This is a loadſtone of power attractiue to draw mens hearts and goodwils vnto her.
            Let vs therefore accuſtome our ſelues to forgiue all the whole worlde. Let not the greatnes or grieuouſnes of the iniurie withhold vs from pardoning them: but on the contrarie ſide let vs thinke, that the greater the iniurie is, the better it deſerueth to bee pardoned, and that the more iuſt our reuenge is, the more our gentlenes is to bee praiſed. But eſpeciallie ſuch as are ſeated by fortune in the higheſt degree of honour, ſhould take heede to their motions that they be remiſſe and temperate: for

for as their actions are of greater importance, ſo their faults are harder to bee cured. The heauen it ſelfe preſenteth them daily with an example and doctrine of auoyding all manner of haſte and precipitation, in ſhewing them that Saturne the very higheſt of all the Planets, is moſt remiſſe and ſloweſt in his courſe. And Aſtronomers ſay, that Iupiter alone by himſelfe is able to ſhoote foorth profitable and pleaſing lightnings and good abodes: but when there is a queſtion of ſending foorth hurtfull and reuenging ſtormes and lightnings, then he cannot do this of his owne authoritie, but is to craue the counſel and aſſiſtance of twelue other gods. And is it not a very ſtrange caſe, that he that is the greateſt of all the gods, that

               
                  •
               an doe good vnto all the whole world, is not able to hurt one perſon, but after a ſolemne counſel & deliberation? ſo that Iupiter himſelfe, though that he bee very wiſe, yet is hee afraid leaſt he ſhould ouerſhoote himſelfe in a matter of reuenge, and therefore thinketh he had neede of good counſell to aduiſe him. Wherefore if at any time we happen to haue feeling of this paſſiō within vs let vs repayre vnto our friends, & ripen our cholers with their pleaſant diſcourſes. For take the beſt man that is in the world when he is moued, & you ſhall ſee whether he be able to doe any thing as he ought to doe. For reaſon being hindered with paſſions, ſtands a man in as much ſtead, as wings doe birds when they are caught with lime-twigs

faſt by the feete. And this is the reaſon why wee ſhould ſtudie to lift vp our hearts from the earth, and place thē in a quiet and peaceable eſtate, if wee deſire to make our ſoules capable of al good and vertuous actions. We muſt neuer leaue till wee haue brought our minds to be of ſuch a diſpoſition, as the higheſt region of the ayre is, which is neuer darkened with clowdes, nor ſhaked with thunderbolts, but enioyeth a continuall fairenes: for ſo the mind ſhuld neuer bee darkened with ſorrow, nor mooued with choler. And if once a man could bring his mind vnto this paſſe, he ſhould very eaſily rule his other actions, & bring them vnto their wiſhed end: for then doubtles hee would followe nature hard by the heeles, tread

altogether in her ſteps, and ioyne himſelfe by a pleaſant and temperate affection vnto thoſe other parts of the world, of which man is the knot, the marriage knot which linketh heauenly & earthly things together.
            The effects of this ſoft and temperate affectiō which mā beareth towards other things of ye world, are called duties, as if they did ſhew vs our dueties & behauiours towards other things. Therefore if we would learne to rule and moderate this dutie, and to bee informed in the right vſe thereof, wee cannot haue a better miſtreſſe then Nature to teach and informe vs. For ſhe hath eſtabliſhed an order and diſpoſ
                  •
               tion in euerie thing, by vertue wherof ſhe committeth things one vnder another,

and yet chaineth them altogether with the linkes of mutuall reſpect which they owe one to another, which ſhe hath engrauen in the forehead of each thing, as Princes ſtamp their images in their coine, to ſhew that they are good and lawfull money. Let vs therefore in euery thing cōſider the order and courſe of nature, and wee ſhall ſtraightwaies know the value of it, whether it bee currant or no, and how much will be giuen for it. Good being the obiect of mans will, where perfect and true good is to be foūd, there our will ought to be moued.
            This being graunted, it muſt needes follow that the ſtrongeſt and chie
                  •
               eſt affection of man, ought to be accounted that which ioyneth vs together with the author

and fountaine of all good, to wit, godlines: for by it a man is reunited and ſubſtantiallie ingra

               ut contrarily, being ſeparated from it, withereth and drieth away incontinently. Now the principall effect of pietie is to teach vs how to know God: for the honour and reſpect which we beare vnto anything, proc

things in the world. Againe, that whatſoeuer he ſendeth vnto vs, is for our good, and that our euill commeth not but from our ſelues. For if wee eſteeme thoſe chaunces euill which God ſendeth vnto vs, we ſhall oftentimes take occaſion to blaſpheme him; becauſe that naturally wee honour them which ſeeke our good, and hate them which procure vs any euill. And therefore wee muſt reſolue with our ſelues to bee obedient vnto him, and take in good part whatſoeuer commeth from his hands. And ſeeing that his knowledge is moſt perfect, his power thriſe infinit, and his will moſt louing and charitable: what reſteth th
                  •
               n, but that we ſhould cōclude that God ſendeth nothing vnto vs, but tendeth to our great good? And albeit

we for our parts cannot conceiue the good which wee ought to receiue of that which hee ſendeth vs; yet neuertheleſſe we hope all is for the beſt: ſuppoſing, that as the Phiſition doth oftentimes many things for the ſafetie of the bodie, which may ſeeme at the beginning to hurt it: ſo God in the guiding of our liues doth ſaue vs by means, which may ſeeme grieuous and hurt full.
            The Phiſition diuers times pricketh the eye to recouer a ma
                  •
               s ſight: and oftentimes GOD almightie vſeth to pricke & wound our hearts with ſharpe afflictions, to reſtore our mindes vnto their brightnes. Vnder the ſeale of this aſſurance wee ought to commit and ſubmit our ſelues vnto him, confeſſing that we come into the

world not to command, but to obey, finding lawes alreadie made which wee 
                  •
               ught to follow. And therefore continually we ought to haue in mind (as a profitable leſſon of our wiſe obedience vnto Gods ordinance) theſe noble verſes of Cleanthes:
            
            
               My God direct and guide my feet
                     •
                  
               
               in thy moſt knowen way:
               For willingly Ile follow thee
               forthwith, without delay.
               For feare leſt bound in fetters ſtrong,
               I be not there held faſt,
               Where gainſt my will, being once faſt bound,
               I cannot come in haſt.
               But as a man that honeſt is,
               I may thereto at taine,
               Whereto the fates and destinies,

                  e of life ordaine.
            
            And ſo for the reſt, let vs neuer addreſſe our prayers and petitions vnto him, but to obtaine that at his hands which he hath purpoſely

ordained for vs. For to aske any thing at Gods hands againſt his prouidence, were as much as in vs lieth to corrupt the Iudge and gouernour of the world. The beſt praier that we can make vnto him both for his honour and our profit, is, that he would vouchſafe to preſerue our affections pure and holie, and to rule and gouerne our will, that it may alwaies be directed towards the attaining of that which is good.
            The ſacrifice which he requireth at our hands, is nothing els but an innocent life: he deſireth not our goods, onely his wil and deſire is, that wee ſhould make our ſelues worthie of his: for there is not ſo ſmall an offering but pleaſeth him well, if it bee preſented vnto him with chaſt and innocent hands.

Againe, there is no ſacrifice bee it neuer ſo rich and coſtly, but diſpleaſeth him as much, if it come from polluted and defiled hands. Apollo being vpon a time demanded how he liked the ſacrifice of an hundred oxen which was offered vp vnto him, gaue this anſwer:

                  •
                A vertuous and wiſe man is the onely true prieſt of the great God, his ſpirit is his temple, wherein he offereth vp daily ſacrifices, his ſoule is his image, his affections are his offerings, and the greateſt and ſolemueſt ſacrifice which you can offer vnto him, is a true & vertuous imitation of him.

I ſay not this, as if the vſuall ceremonies in each countrie were not to be obſerued, ſo that there be an honeſt moderation of them without exceſſe or couetouſneſſe, but becauſe I am of opinion that God will be ſerued inſpirit. And therefore to conclude this poynt, this is that I ſay, yt the beſt māner of ſeruing & worſhipping him is, after we haue aſcribed all praiſe & glory vnto him, and decked him with all manner of titles which mans ſpirit can imagine, to hold this for a moſt conſtant reſolution, and confeſſe it publikely, that we haue preſented nothing vnto him worthie of his diuine Maieſtie; the fault being not in his Godhead, but in our impotencie and weaknes, which can neuer conceiue ſo highly of him as he is.

                ſweare, we muſt looke that we vſe to doe it as ſoberly and ſparingly as we may. For the vſe of any thing whatſoeuer,

if it bee too vulgar and common, makes it to bee neglected and deſpiſed. And in any caſe look well to it, yt it be vſed to no other end but for aſſurance and confirmation of the truth; repreſenting GOD before our eyes, ſitting on high as protector of the faithfull, and ſharpe puniſher of periured perſons.
            Now from the honour duevnto God, the firſt cauſe of all, wee muſt deſcend as it were a ſtep lower vnto that duty which we owe vnto the heauenly powers, ordayned by God, for adminiſtration and gouernmēt of the world, and in them alſo wee muſt acknowledge a kind of excellencie & conſtancie of vertue in their perfectiō, admiring the greatnes of their creator, and honouring their miniſterie,

imployed for preſeruation and protection of vs men.
            From thence let vs goe a little lower vnto the reuerence and reſpect which wee owe vnto them, by whoſe means as through pipes and conduits choſen by God, wee are deriued into this world. And in this place wee ſhall finde that our countrie may iuſtly challenge her prerogatiue, which vnder a fained and compound name, cō
               prehendeth an vnfained, true and naturall loue. For good cauſe wee owe of dutie more loue vnto our countrie, then vnto al otherthings contained in the world: becauſe indeed it containeth infolden and wrapped within her ſafetie, the ſafetie and good of euery thing that wee doe loue and cheriſh: and contrariwiſe with her all the reſt

will ſoone periſh and be brought to nought. Out of the fountaine of this worthie affection, what a number of worthie and excellent deedes haue guſhed and ſtreamed foorth? of ſome that haue ſpent their liues for the good of their countrie: and other ſome which haue been content to forgoe their owne priuate iniuries, for feare leaſt if they ſhould haue ſought to haue reuenged them, they ſhould haue preiudiced the Commonwealth: of others that haue choſe to leade a miſerable and ſorrowfull life, to the end that they might procure their countries quiet reſt and happines. Still repreſent and lay before your eyes your countrie which hath brought you into this world, and here preſerueth you in

               afetie, ſuppoſe that ſhe is euer a

redemanding & asking of you the rights of pietie, and requiring the dutie and deuoir of a good & loyall citizen, and that ſhe doth coniure you to ſeeke and couet after her good by the countrie of your natiuitie, by the lawes of your citie, by the faith of ciuill ſocietie, by the ſafetie of your parents, children and friends, and laſtly by your owne ſafetie and good. I beſeech you therefore to haue more care of your countrie, then of all the world beſides, and neuer preferre your particular profit before the good thereof: ſeeke not to auoyd the euill which is falling vpon you by turning it vpon he head.

            From our parents let vs enter into conſideration of our children, whom though wee doe not reuerence with like affection, yet haue we like care or rather a greater regarde of their welfare. For ſeeing that God hath placed and put vs in this world to garde and keep it, it ſeemeth that before we goe out of the worlde, wee are bound and obliged to ſubrogate and ſubſtitute others in our places to miniſter and ſerue the ſoueraigne power in this common temple. The bringing

               oorth of children is ours but in part, there bee many thinges herein which

contribute with vs, but the bringing vp and inſtitution of them is altogether in our hands, which wee muſt owe of dutie, firſt vnto God to whom wee muſt preſent and offer them: ſecondly to our countrie, for whoſe ſeruice they are borne: and laſtly to our ſelues, which are to looke for at their hands (if they bee well and vertuouſly brought vp) for al manne
                  •
                of help & ſuccour in our old age. Therfore for theſe and the like reſpects, we ought to be moſt vigilant and carefull ouer them, and to procure as farre as in vs lieth their good.
            Now after our children follow our wiues, who being vnited vnto vs by the law, and entring into ſocietie and fellowſhip with vs, vnder the deare pledge of children

which they bring vs, ha

The ſharpe ſawce of our life is ſweetened by the ſugar of their friendſhips, by their care the care of our buſines is abated, nay wee may ſafely reſt our ſelues vnder their labours and induſtrie: let vs therfore haue ſuch a reſpectiue care ouer them, as they haue ouer vs; let vs think and dreame vpon nothing but vpon their reſt and quietnes, as being the moytie and the other halfe of our ſelues. But eſpecially let vs make it knowne vnto them, that we do not honor them for any pleaſure which their youth or beauties may affoord vs; as well for feare leaſt if we doe ſo, wee happen to puffe vp their courages, and make them take more ſtate vpon them then necdeth:

as alſo in this reſpect, that whereas this affection is founded and grounded vpon ſuch a ſlipperie and running thing, it is to bee feared leaſt the heate thereof bee ſoone quenched: but let vs reſpect and worſhip them for the faith and loyaltie which we looke for at their hands, for their good qualities and modeſt behauiours: and laſt of all, for the eſpecial care which they haue of their children

And the better to prouoke and ſtirre them vp to loue and cheriſh vs, let vs ſhew that we wil not appropriate anything from them vnto our ſelues, but make them equally partakers of our goods, thoughts & affections. For this communitie of all things maye greatly ſerue to nouriſh

good will and amitie betweene vs, which is cleane loſt and aboliſhed in the diuerſitie of willes and determinations.
            This affection paſſeth from our wiues vnto their kinsfolke, which are allied vnto vs by nature, their rūning together with their bloud, a ſecret inclination of good will and affection towards all them which are ſprung from the ſame branch, and accordingly as they are neerer vnto vs in bloud, ſo are wee more liuely affected towards them, & bound to performe and yeeld vnto them neerer duties and ſeruices. Therefore herein as well as in all other matters to obſerue the order of nature, as being the ſoueraigne ornament of all creatures, let vs (as I haue ſayd before) ſo diſpenſe the loue and affection

which wee owe vnto our parents, as they doe neerer concerne and regard vs, yeelding them all manner of helpe and ſuccour which can poſſibly be deuiſed.
            Hetherto nature hath as it were with her owne hand moued our affections: now wee muſt of neceſſitie come to ſpeake of the motions and inclinations which vertue giueth, which bindeth vs to loue and honour vertuous & wiſe men. And truely of all the goods which we enioy by the benefit of common ſocietie, there is no one that ought to bee more eſteemed and cheriſhed, then the friendſhip and amitie of honeſt men: for it is the very piller and vpholder of our happines: it is ſhe that gouernes our liues, ſweetneth our ſowre, and ſeaſoneth our ſweete: ſhe giueth

vs in proſperitie one vpon whom wee may beſtow part of our goods and enioy the comforts of our proſperitie, who in time of affliction wil be readie to ſuccour and comfort vs, one that can teach and inſtruct vs in our youth
                  •
                helpe and relieue vs when we bee olde, aſſiſt and ſecond vs in our middle ages. And as the poſſeſſion hereof is pretious, ſo we ought to employ our wiſedoms to haue this friendſhip as perfect as may be. And to this ende and purpoſe wee muſt hunt and ſeeke after men of the greateſt merits, honouring and cheriſhing them as if they were ſent from God to ioyne with vs in a ſocietie of certaine noble and worthie actions. Wee muſt ſeeke to purchaſe it by honeſt occaſiōs: and hauing once gotten it, ſtudie
                  •
               
               
to preſerue it by a due performāce of all duties. For all creatures, and principally men, are borne with a kinde of inclination of loue towards that which may any waies profit or auaile them. And yet for al this, a vertuous man doth neuer meaſure his profite by the ell of goods (as we call them) or riches: but by the commoditie which hee receiueth & reapeth by his friends in the ſtudie of vertue. And if it ſo fall out that there be any commoditie, bee it neuer ſo ſmall, to bee parted betweene vs & our friends, touching our goods and honours, or ſuch like things, it ſhall bee our parts to giue place vnto them: for all this cannot be better imployed then in purchaſing of true friends. On the contrary ſide, there is but one onely reaſon which may excuſe

vs from leauing their friendſhip and amitie, and that is when they abandon reaſon and philoſophie, which ioyneth and combineth vs together. And yet this muſt be done very warily: for we may not be at plaine enmitie with them for all this. We muſt rather vnrip then rent their friendſhips from vs, and ſeeke out all reaſonable meanes (if it be poſſible) to bring them backe againe vnto their duties, without blaming their actions, or checking their opinios: neuer fighting with them, vnles it be by way of diſputation and diſcourſe, which are the ſacred weapons of true friēdſhip: but though we loſe al hope of preuailing with them this way, yet wee may not become their open and profeſſed enemies. For though a good man

leaue his friends when they leaue off to bee vertuous: yet not withſtanding ſo it is, that in forſaking that friendſhippe and familiaritie which hath been in former time betweene them, he retaineth that common affection which ought to bee amongſt men, which bindeth them to wiſh wel vnto thoſe which haue not well deſerued at their hands: telling them that this is to imitate God, which as he loueth the good, ſo he doth not hate the bad. And therefore we haue a common ſaying, that a good man hath no enemies at all, becauſe he hateth no bodie.
            Thus you ſee the degrees of affection which are betweene man and the things which are without him. But becauſe it commeth ſo to paſſe many times, that they doe

draw vs vnto diuers ends, and ſo hold vs ſuſpended in doubtfulnes and incertaintie, therfore we muſt eſtabliſh a rule vnto our ſelues of preferring the former duties before the latter. We ought to make great account of an oth, and yet it were better broken then kept, if by keeping of it we offend God. We muſt of force highly reuerēce our fathers and mothers: and yet if their wils doe contradict right reaſon, which is appoynted by God himſelfe to gouerne vs, wee muſt rather forſake them, then forſake God and reaſon. Our kinſfolkes are to bee eſteemed deare vnto vs, but yet if they ſeeke to annoy and moleſt father or mother, we may lawfully diſſ
                  •
               nt from thē. Friends may preuaile much with a man, his wife and childrē much

more: and yet for all this, there are certaine particular and priuate duties which are rather to be performed to them which are further off from vs, then to them which be neerer: but commonly it is in a matter of no great waight when ciuill ſocietie (becauſe of the common neceſſitie of men) incrocheth and vſurpeth ſomewhat vpon nature. As when wee ſay we ſhould helpe our neighbour in fetching in of his harueſt, and not our kinſman, and in ſuch like caſes.
            I haue hetherto, as you ſee, repreſented vnto you the reſpect which man oweth vnto thinges which are without him: it is now high time to cauſe him to deſcend into himſelfe, and bring backe his affections vnto his owne proper perſon, as lines are reduced vnto

their center. A wiſe man without doubt yeeldeth much reſpect vnto himſel
                  •
               e: and though no body regard him but his owne conſcience, yet hee will bee very carefull that he doe neither ſpeake nor doe any thing which is not fit and cō
               uenient. For right ordered reaſon, which ought to gouerne all his actions, is vnto him the ſeuereſt iudge and cenſor of his actions that can be found. And therefore wee muſt ſtudie as well pub
                  •
               kely as priuatly ſo to frame and faſhiō our actions in ſuch ſort, that wee may not haue occaſion to bluſh and be aſhamed of them: & that nature which ought to be 
                  •
               he rule of all our actions, be not violated in any ſort. Now it hath pleaſed nature to giue vs a bodie, as a neceſſarie inſtrument for the preſeruation

of mans life. Therefore we muſt take care for the bodie, but no otherwiſe then we would doe for a thing which is vnder the protection of the minde, which muſt bee carefull for the ſafetie thereof, but no waies ſeruiceable vnto it: he muſt entreate it ſo as if he were a Lord and no tyrant ouer the bodie, ſtill nouriſhing it without engroſſing or fatting it: ſo that it may euidently appeare vnto all men that hee doth not liue for it, but that hee cannot liue without it.
            A cunning workman is not a little forward in his buſines, when he hath gotten all his tooles about him in a readines: and ſo hee that loueth philoſophy doth not a little thing profit himſelfe, if he doe but once know how to ſerue himſelfe

with his bodie, and make it a fit inſtrumēt for him to exerciſe vertue. Now the bodie may be preſerued in health two manner of waies: the one is by moderation in his diet: the other, by good order in his exerciſe. For why the nature of things here beneath is ſo ſlipperie and vncertaine, that vnleſſe a man doe continually repayre that which time doth waſte and conſume, things will by little and little come in the ende to nought. Therefore wee muſt ſuſtaine and helpe the bodie once decaying by vſe of meates; but with this prouiſo or caueat, that wee doe not make it, by making too great cheare, heauie, dull, and vnfit for contemplation: nor by too ſpare diet and ill entreatance, weake and ſickly: ſo that it bee

neither effeminated with riot, nor by neglect of it accuſtome it ſelfe to filth and beaſtlines.
            After meate followeth exerciſe, although they ſeeme to bee confounded and to follow one an other indifferently. For firſt wee exerciſe our ſelues, and then wee take our repaſt: and after meate then we fall a freſh to exerciſe: the firſt exerciſe ſerues to prepare vs to the better appetite and receiuing our meates: the ſecond, to waken nature, and keepe the parts of the bodie in continuall motion. We muſt vſe our exerciſes ſo, that the bodie may bee the better for them, and our minde nothing the worſe: but we muſt not ſeek ſuch exerciſes as wraſtlers vſe, and ſuch like, which doe all things by compaſſe and meaſure, and many obſeruations,

which ſerue indeede to keepe the bodie vpright & ſtrong, & to no other vſe: but therby they weaken the ſtrength of the ſoule, and take away from her her true and naturall motions. It is an abſurditie for a wiſe man to be carefull for to find out fit exerciſes for the bodie, ſeeing that he may find euery where ſo many as are requiſite and needfull for the health thereof.
            After the bodie is once nouriſhed and exerciſed in ſuch ſort as I haue ſhewed you, it is moſt eaſily faſhioned and framed vnto modeſt & ſeemely actions, which we ſhould ſo much regard and labour to attaine vnto, that in our very countenances and gate ſhuld appeare a great tranquilitie of mind, mixed with a ſober & pleaſant

kinde of grauitie. I doe not ſpeake this as if I would haue you to vſe anie affectation in your countenance and geſtures, as to looke with the flatterers ſmile, or the Philoſophers frowne. For as a ſober grauitie maketh a man to be reuerenced of all: ſo a kinde of portlike and conſtrained auſteritie, makes him to appeare ridiculous and odious vnto all.
            But becauſe it is ſpeech which giueth life vnto our countenances and dead geſtures, therefore wee muſt take great heede that we be able to rule and gouerne it. And ſurely the beſt precept which wee can giue any man in this caſe, is ſilence. For to know how to be ſilent with reaſon is a great aduantage, if a man mark it, to him that meanes to ſpeake well: 
                  •
               or it is not

poſſible for a man to ſpeake well, & to ſpeake much, one mā cannot doe both. Silence is the father of diſcourſe and fountaine of reaſon: contrarily in much talke there is much offence. They that ayme directly at anything, ſhut one of their eyes and winke with the other: and wherefore doe they ſo? but to ſtrengthen and encreaſe the vertue of their ſight. This teacheth vs yt the ſences being caſt abroad, doe by the very powring foorth of themſelues waxe feeble & weake: and euen ſo is it with the ſpirit, being caſt abroad by ſpeech, and ſcattered and difuſed into many wordes, it loſeth his force and vertue. But on the contrarie ſide, if it be reſtrained with ſilence, it gathereth his wonted ſtrength, and ſtores himſelfe with prudence and

wi
                  •
               edome. The vſe of words whē occaſion bids vs ſpeake, ought to bee this: to ayde the trueth, and to carrie the candle before her that ſhe may be ſeene: & contrariwiſe to diſcouer and reiect lyes and vntruth: to praiſe that which is good, and blame that which is otherwiſe. We muſt not accōpanie our ſpeech with too great vehemēcie or contention, for this ſheweth our paſſions. Againe, we muſt not vſe to diſcourſe of matters that doe happen in common aſſemblies or Theaters, or to entertaine them that bee in our companie with ſuch or the like diſcourſes: for this ſheweth much leiſure and ſmall profit.
            Furthermore, it is not conuenient to ſtand much vpon our actions, or to tell men what we haue

done, & what hath chanced vnto vs in our times: for there is much vanitie herein. Others peraduenture take not ſo much pleaſure in hearing you talk, as you do in telling & recounting your owne vanities. To ſpeake of other mēs actions, without offence, is a very dangerous and hard matter: for either wee commend them without reaſon, or els blame thē without knowing their intention. But aboue all other things, let vs take heede of making ſongs of men, or laughing and gibing at them: for ſo doth euery common ieſter, and it makes vs loſe our reputatiō with good men. Beſides, theſe ieſts are for the moſt part mixed with filthie and lewd wordes, which wee ſhould ſhunne and auoyd. Now the libertie of ſpeaking vnhoneſt

and vnſ
                  •
               emely wordes, draweth after it the like effects. But wee muſt ſtriue (if it be poſſible) that our wordes may redound to the profit of them which ſhall heare vs, that they be ſtuffed with good and wholeſom precepts, that they ſerue to bring them back vnto the ſtudie of vertue which wander in the way of ſinne and wickednes. In our common diſcourſe wee muſt auoyd too profound and ſubtill queſtions. For a man may compare thē to creyfiſhes, which affoord a mā more picking worth then meate: the ende of them is nothing els but braules and contention: and moſt commonly it ſo 
                  •
               areth with them as it doth with men that haue weake ſtomackes, which vomit vp al that which they cannot well diſgeſt. As wee deſire

to haue audience when we ſpeake our ſelues, ſo muſt we be attentiue to other mens ſpeeches, and heare them to the end without interruption. We muſt not accord and agree vnto all that is ſayd: for there bee ſome which will not ſticke to ſay anything, and others that will contradict them as faſt: ſome be flatterers, others bee raſh and inconſiderate: but wee muſt yeeld our conſents to that which is euidently true, and peremptorily denie that which is euidently falſe, and in doubtfull thinges ſuſpend our iudgemēts, till we haue found ſome reaſon or ground to ſtand vpon.
            Now becauſe a mans wordes and geſtures are framed by long cuſtome and imitation of others, we ſhould not ſort our ſelues too

much with the common ſort of people, or haunt the Theaters and common places of aſſemblie, or haue often recourſe to feaſts and banquets: for in euery one of theſe places it is not poſſible but a man ſhould draw ſome vile humour or other from the common people. If it ſo happen that wee muſt needes bee there for ourhonours and credits ſakes, yet wee muſt alwaies haue our minds ſo ſtraight bound, that wee will not remit a iot of our courage and reſolution, that is, to gouerne our ſelues in like ſort as I haue ſhewed you before. And the better to ſtrengthen & fortifie our ſelues, let vs in each thing that we go about, lay before our eyes the examples of wiſe and graue men, and imagine with our ſelues what a Socrates or a Zeno
               
woulde haue done, if they had been in our places: and by and by you 
                  ••
               all ſee their vertues will miniſter vnto vs an example of well doing. But the beſt leſſon of all which Philoſophie can teach vs to behaue our ſelues in all our actions, is carefully to ſet down
                  •
                and examine with our ſelues the proceeding and ending of euerie buſines which we doe take in hād, to meaſure our ſtrengths and abilitie, & try whether it be not proportionable vnto our deſſeignements. He that taketh wiſe counſell before hand, ſhall ſoone arriue at his wiſhed port: but he
                  •
                that taketh no counſell, is like vnto him that flotes vp and downe in a riuer, he
                  •
                doth not goe whither he
                  •
                would goe, but is violently carried away againſt his intended courſe,

and ſo committing himſelfe vnto the mercie of the flouds, arriueth at length at the ſea: that is to ſay, a vaſt and turbulent kind of incertitude.
            Therefore before we enterpriſe any matter, let vs wiſely foreſee what the end of it is likely for to be, then let, vs cōſider what means we haue to atchieue it, and ſo wee ſhall bee able euen in thought to preuent all euill chances that are likely to encounter vs. Would you 
                  •
               aine bee one of them which exerciſe themſelues at the games of Olympus? think then how much it behoueth you to beſtirre you, if you will doe it for your credits ſake, you muſt liue by rule and ſquare, diet your ſelfe to certaine meates, and certaine houres, accuſtome your ſelfe to heate and

cold, annoynt your bodie with oyle, then haue duſt throwne ouer it, enter within the liſts, be hurt, & it may be 
                  •
               leane vanquiſhed and diſgraced. After you haue wiſely foreſeene all this, conſider the habitude and diſpoſition of your bodie, whether it will brooke this kinde of exerciſe or no, and then vndertake it if you pleaſe. If you haue a deſire to be of the Philoſophers profeſſion, repreſent & lay before your face the manifolde troubles which your poore 
                  •
               oule muſt be contented to endure: as to be depriued of many pleaſures and commodi
                  •
               ies, and with great patience to ſuffer all the world to gibe and ieſt at you. If your courage will ſerue you to endure all this and a great deale more, you may take this courſe of life vpon

you: but when you haue one vndertaken it, forgoe or forſlow it not at any hand, conſtantly perſeuer and follow your determination as a law inuiolable. For beſides this inconuenience which commeth by changing our purpoſes, that it maketh our mindes doubtfull and vncertaine, there is this harme in it, that it cauſeth vs to become ridiculous vnto others: where on the contrary ſide, conſtancie in the end makes vs to be admi
                  •
               ed of them which at the firſt laughed and ieſted at vs.
            And becauſe I would not haue you be terrified with mens iudgements which they ſhall giue concerning your actions
                  •
                let this be al your care and induſtrie, that your actions be ſuch as they ought to be. Doe not ſtudie to conceale or

hide them from them which ſay they doe not like them; if they be not good, it behoued you not then to haue done them; and if they be good, the better they ſhall bee knowne the more aſſurance ſhall you haue of them. I doe not ſpeak this as if my meaning were that you ſhould couet to bee ſeene in well doing, or call all the people about you to ſee your vertues, as they do which betake themſelues vnto Images for ſanctuarie. As the colour ſhineth and gliſtereth in the day time, yet ſeekes not the Sunne to come and gild it; onely ſtands readie preſt to receiue the light thereof whē it ſhineth: euen ſo vertue ought not to ſeeke and hunt after glorie, but onely be readie diſpoſed to entertaine and admit of it, as the teſtimonie of thoſe

which iudge vn

                  •
                merits. He that loueth praiſe and oſtentation, forſakes reaſon to follow opinion: for he
                  •
                ſetteth downe this as a maine rule vnto himſelfe, that he had rather pleaſe another man then himſelfe.
            There is nothing which can help vs ſo much to make that ſort well which wee haue luckely vndertaken, as the taking of times and opportunities. For time carrieth with it certaine moments, which are the ſeaſons and opportunities of buſines. If you loſe them, or let them ſlip, you loſe all your labour and pains. But if occaſion be once taken with opportunitie, and followed with diligence, you ſhall ſeldome miſſe of your purpoſe, but haue alwaies good ſucceſſe in your affayres. And therefore

wee muſt looke that that which hath been maturely deliberated and thought vpon, be ſpeedily put in execution: and let vs not accuſtome our ſelues to poſt that ouer to the morrow, which may be as well done the ſame day. But whē we doe anything, though we doe it neuer ſo wiſely, take all aduantages, chuſe all opportunities, vſe all poſſible diligence: yet for all this we muſt know that the greateſt part of the euent is altogether ouer maſtered by Fortune. Wee are lords and maſters of our counſels and determinations, but al the reſt dependeth vpō other matters which are not in our power. And therefore we can doe no more but vndertake a matter with wiſedome, purſue it with hope, and be readie to ſuffer whatſoeuer ſhall

happen with patience. If good enterpriſes haue bad ſucceſſe, the anſwere which the noble man of Perſia made, may ſerue for an excuſe to all them which are wiſe, but vnfortunat. One was deſirous to know of him wherefore (ſeeing yt he knew him to bee a very wiſe & valiant gentleman) his affayres went no better forward. Becauſe (quoth hee) in my affayres I can but giue good counſell, that is all I can doe, the ſucceſſe belongeth altogether vnto Fortune or God that is Lord ouer her. Therefore it is ſufficient for vs if wee doe all that belongeth vnto vs, that is, if wee attempt nothing but with a good end, and follow it not but by lawfull and honeſt meanes.
            Thus at the length (to grow to an end) you haue heard diſcourſed

vnto you the principall lawes which the Stoickes thinke expedient to vſe for the better ordering and gouerning of mans life: but becauſe lawes without iudgements are nothing worth, but like dead words, therefore if wee will make our profite and benefit of them, wee muſt euery day in the euening narrowly
