            To the Right Honourable, the Lords and others of his Maiesties most Honourable priuie Councell. Robert Pricket wisheth all increase of Honour in this world, and in the world to come life euerlasting.
            
               MY honoured Lords, it is a true saying, that Conscientia est mille testes, which sentence makes me confident, because I know the vprightnes of my heart to God, and faithfull and obedient loyalty vnto my King, and loue to you the honourable Peeres and Princes of the State, together with my honest zeale vnto my countries benefit, is, in the presence of heauens Maiestie testified by a thousand witnesses, and therefore in the iustice of my hopes resolue, I haue aduentured, vnto your honours to dedicate this little booke, and in the clearenes of my consciencs, I cannot but expect a kind acceptance at your Lordships hands.
            The last vntimely fruit, which by a publicke print I rashly published▪ gaue iust occasion to procure your dislike: and my amisse there in, was greater, then at first I could conceiue, for it is an euill not to be borne with, when the greatest (much more, when so meane a subiect as my selfe) shall dare to call in qrestion, things formerly determined, by the iustice of the Law, iudgment of the honoured Peeres, and prudent wisedome of a kingdomes most honourable Councellers: and too high doth their

presumption clime (especially in a cause of so great consequence▪) whose words would seeme as if they did desire, so to extenuate an offence, as that in respect of the offendor, opinion should bee taught, eyther to taxe the Lawe with crueltie, or the State with inhumanity: he therefore whose actions shall but beare a shew, as if they were directed vnto some such purpose, iustly deserueth to be punnished. And yet may it please your Honours; I must needes confesse, my punnishment was compounded of an absolute Lenitie, without (in the least sort) beeing mixt with any apparance of Seueritie: 
               
                  〈◊〉
                as I am in this respect, bound vnto you all (my Lords) so principally my thanks must humbly runne, vnto the Right Honorable the Earle of Salisbury, by whose loue and bountie, my cause was fauourably censured, my liberty procured, and my wants relieued. Concerning the worthinesse of whose euer honourable disposition, I would largely speake, but that I know; true honoured vertue, whose euer constant wisdome, and approued Iudgement, laboureth to performe each vertuous and well commended office, so as it cannot, but by a certaine kinde of supreame excellence, worthily deserue worlds praise, yet will it not indure to heare it selfe praised.
            As iust cause there is, so now I doe reioyce to see, that Mars and Mercurie, are in Coniunction ioyned, the powerfull Venus, Lady of that house, and mightie Iupiter, with kinde Apect, Predominate: Maiestie, Honour, Wisdome, loue, and wisdomes gouernment, haue wrought a happie worke, vnto them all, be still continued and increast, the glory of each best esteemed happinesse. And that Emperiall greatest vnion maker, whose prudent iudgement, laboureth in peace for to vnite, great Brittons Monarchie, in him, and in his Royall line, shall most Princely and potent Monarches be establish

Their soules humilitie, and repentant hearts, doe from these things beneath, with ioy, direct faiths eyes aboue to looke, they shall behold the glory of that throne, where shines the euer radiant golden beames of heauens eternall glorious malestie, where at the right hand of God the father, sits redemptions only strength, & worlds alone saluation, Iesus Christ, who hath prepard a

kingdome for his Saints, from whence the greatest power can neuer plucke the poorest soule, that on his grace depends and in the meditation of this felicitie and vncompared neuer ending happines, let them reioyce who in this world do want each worldly cause of ioy.
            Those Idle vaine misgouernd dissolutes, the spots and staines of our corrupted time, proud plumed gallants whose actions Atheismeticall, do seeme as if they scornde both heauen and hell, for them I wish they did but know themselues, or could perceaue the fearefull horror of their owne estate; for certaine the world shal passe from them, or they from it, and they not here on earth their sinnes repenting, the world to come shall be to them most terrible.

            You little least and almost vnseene number in respect of worlds great multitude, who in your hearts doe purpose to performe, those actions that vnto righteousnes belong; know I canot giue offence to you by plainly setting foorth the true Anotamy, of our times abuse, doe you as those of heanen beloued, increase in loue, and heauenly charity: for those whom God doth iustifie, their affections are also sanctied, vnto the obedience of his will. Make therefore your election sure, by sufficient testimony in your selues, on earth, by holy workes, let your faith bee dignified that in heauen by faith alone, you may be iustified, bild not the sollace of your faiths content, vpon the fruitlesse florish, of vnfruitful leaues; nor let a selfe concealed pride, or wilfull arrogance, disturbe the peace of Syon, and glory of our church, but, as becomes the members of Iesus Christ our head, ioyne in the fellowship of saints and walke together in the pathes of sanctity, stil praysing God whose mercie hath preserued great Briton

            Not to wrong the Romaine charitie, but to giue the diuell his due, if on the Popes behalfe I stood with no lesse confidence, then I against him doe, vndoubtedly, I thinke that then I should not need for to deplore, nor yet complaine, the wants of me and mine, nor to indure an vnrespected misery: but God forbid that any hope of gaine, should make me ioyne with them that are the soes to Christ, nor doe I now inforce my maner of writing, by reason of the times aduantage, for by a booke intituled A Souldiers Resolution, dedicated to the King, and vnto his Royall selfe deliuered, I made bould to tell his Maiestie, euen at his first comming into England, what fruites his Highnesse should expect to reape from Romaine Catholicks, and now my words are by their actions verified.
            
               As touching Papists generally, I those to heauen commit, that vnto heauen belong, and for the treasons to our King, & kingdomes, done by Romes adherence, & Popish packe, Catholicall, be all they accused, that may iustly be condemned and for those that haue beene actors in this last and greatest treason, let iustice vnto their destruction follow them, and least good subiects should still too much affect, those that will remaine infected with the Romane Leprosie, I but request the well affected sort indifferently to iudge. What may not they doe, vnto whom all thinges may be made lawfull to be done, and what credit is there to be giuen to them, vnto whom is granted so learge a libertie? and what vse they haue alwaies made thereof, the world may witnesse, and our experience haue oft beene in a dangerous hassar'd, to be most dearely bought, those then that by substantiall proofe, cannot otherwise bee accounted, then corrupted and infected members, alwaies corrupting, infecting, and most dangerously working in our publick weale, why may not euery good subiect, iustly desire to be discharged of them, for vnlesse, the materiall cause whence euill proceeds be clearely takē hence, the effects of euill can neuer cease, and when some times an euils presumption, be not so at first laide hold vpon, as that thereby the passage of each suspected course, may with an inuiolable strength be stayed: A little sufferance (in such cause) may most vnhappily too soone, produce the damned vildenesse of some vil le action done, whereby a iust lamenting, shall haue too iust a cause to runne before a iust reuenging; but the consideration hereof, I referre vnto the Maiestie, honour, and wisdome of that place, where at this time, there should not now haue beene, eyther place, wisdome, honour, or Maiestie, if Romes designes, could with a hell-borne blacke destructions hand, haue rac'd them out.

               By Adams fall, he and his children fell,
               And when to rise, no meanes at all they knew,

               A generall cuill, a land to vildenesse bent,
               Must needs expect some fearefull punishment.
               Of present time, the things desired heere,
               Time prooues my words, and makes the truth appeere.
               Of time to come, I humbly doe auowe,
               Experience shall my words for truth allowe.
               Search but the Story of that writte diuine,
               And vnderstand the change of euery time.
               Fiue hundred, fiftie two yeares coumpted was,
               A period whole, which euer brought to passe,
               
                  Strange alterations, both in Church and State,
               Kings, Kingdomes then, did striue to ruinate.
               Temples were rac'te, Religion cleane despisde,
               Tyrants by force of sword, new lawes deuisde.
               And now the time doth on such period stand,
               As if it meant to take like course in hand.
               Do but obserue, each Celestiall spheare,
               
               And see what signes doe in their course appeare.
               Compare the time, with antedated times,
               And vnderstand the Heauens true speaking signes.
               Then will you not these lines of mine deride,
               Nor smother them, with smoake of scornfull pride.

               The Souldier which doth scorne the lye to take,
               Should scorne as much himselfe the lye to make.
               The open fields, to me is made my bed,
               A bancke of earth, a pillow for my head.
               In shadie groues, and sollitary places,
               My steps doe make their sorrowes mournfull traces.

               A constant faith, true resolution proues,
               Feares not what vnder the first moouer mooues.
               And in this thought I see with humble eye,

               For Heauen and earth, by fire once purgd, then sure,
               They shall remaine, as they at first were pure.
               When God the world, to iudgement summon will,
               That first great mouer, keepes his motion still▪
               
               
                  Whose slow pace round, doth roundly comprehend,
               Those lesser Orbes, that vnder him doe wend.
               In order each, his fixed iourney takes,
               And in their turnes, celestiall musicke makes.
               And then I thinke of that most happie time,
               When I shall heare their dulsiue heauenly chime.
               Aboue them all, faiths eyes through Bethelem,

               The mightie maker of this wondrous all.
               When thether once my ioyfull thoughts are sent,
               I am amazde with wonders rauishment.
               Nor tongues, nor Pens, nor Angels can expresse,
               The glory of that glorious happinesse.
               From thence to Luna, not any Orbe to misse,
               I cannot finde, where Purgatorie is.
               So that I thinke, it sure remaineth yet,
               Within their bellies that deuised it.
               And those that would attaine to heauens great ioy,
               Must leaue bye-pathes, and finde in Christ their way.
               But for the Starres, I creatures them account,
               Aboue them all, their makers power must mount.
               And by their influence, more I will not learne,
               Then Rules diuine, shall teach me to discearne.
               And in that course, men sometimes are befriended,
               Of those pure fiers, by whom they are attended.
               God euer yet, by signes and visions told,
               So as worlds change, worlds worldlings might behold.
               But cloddes of clay, because they will not greeue,
               This course they take, to heare, but not beleeue,
               To gesse, to speake, to iudge, great states to touch,
               For me poore soule, it is a strength too much.
               Who so doth tel what things themselues doe show,
               
                  May doubt his words wil too presumptuous growe.
            
            
               FVll twenty times, nights Bride her selfe hath chaung'd,
               Since from my former worke, my muse estraung'd.
               Her grieued thoughts, my owne estate to viewe,
               Still being fed, with wormewood, gall, and rue.
               And now though wrapt in foldes of mournefull care,
               I am rowsde vp, some part with them to beare.
               Which doe reioyce, as theirs, so is my ioy,
               That God is pleasd hells actions to destroye.
               And now my muse in more then wonder wrapt,
               Will speake of what, since first shee writ hath hapt.
               Two nights before the night of Englands wrack,
               Such greifes themselues vpon my breast did pack;
               That from woes Cowch I rose alone to walke,
               And with myselfe, of my sad fa

               For when daies light vpon my face should shine,
               I knew those wants, would

               No sooner vp, and forth my chamber stept,
               But straight my thoughts into amasement lept.
               For round about, I saw so cleere a light,
               As that I thought, it rather daie then night▪
               
               And well I knew that Luna then did please,
               To shew her selfe to the Antipedes.
               
               And when aloft I did suruey the skie,
               There was no starres that any man could spie.
               To search the cause resolu'd of my intent,
               I walkt abroade to view the Element.
               A tossing winde, whorl'd round the earth below,
               as from earths wombe, some tombling noyse did growe.
               Said I, such noyse as this, is said of some,
               For to foretell an Earth-quake nere to come:
               And looking vp, a generall seeing flame,
               With burning streames, bemantled all heauens frame.
               
                  That from one part did not arise lights beames,
               But heauen was Cloath'd, with vniuersall streames.
               Amids the Ayre, I might sometimes espie,
               The flashing flames vnto a roundnes flye.
               And then dispierce themselues immediatly,
               The world ore spreeding with a burning Cannopie.
               When thus I saw sent from the fiery spheate,
               Such burning streames and flashing flames so cleere.
               Said I, this truth doth on these signes depend,
               Doubtles the world is neere vnto her end▪
               
               And then I thought, that such despisde as I,
               With ioy should haue, an end of miserie.
               Thus hauing view'd till eyes all dazled were,
               My reeling steps, my dussie braines did beare.
               To sorrows cell, the Caue of former Care,
               Vnto my selfe I did my woes declare.
            
            
               From Sol, to Mars, with vsuall attribute,
               Foure times Aurora in her Crimson sure.
               Had bid god morrow to her friendes beneath,
               Whilest all this time, my griefe (woes sighs) did breath▪
               
               And then my minde, griefes danger to eschue,
               For solace went Gorguntus walles to viewe.
               Abroad, my steps, had me no sooner brought,
               But straight my eares had such a rumour caught,
               As made me start, and in a maze to wonder,
               How hell deuisde, to rend the world in sounder.
               A treason no, A deuill borne fiery rage,
               A worke nere thought of in precedent age.
               A Sauage wrath, whose like nere staynd a storie,
               Should haue destroyd the heauen of Britons glory.
               
                  Its true in warre, that souldiers not refuse,
               Against their foes, the like deuise to vse.
               But in a kingdome, by subiects to their King,
               The world till now, nere heard so vilde a thing.
               The name of England, with datelesse infamie,
               Had stood ingrauen to worldes posteritie.
               Breeder of Deuills so sit for villany,
               As at one blow, could sack a monarchie.
               The whore, whose lawes, allowes such deedes of horror,
               Let heauen, and earth, and all the world abhorre her.
            
            
               The Proiect of these trayterous homycites,
               A booke at large to euery mind recites.
               And though I would, I dare not speake no more,
               Of Treason plotts, then hath beene spoke before.
               But now I see, the night that I admyred,
               Foretold the flame, that should the world haue fiered.
               And yet the generall of heauens fiety warte,
               Included more then on particular.
               Oh if that God for Englands sinne had pleasd,
               That horred act, on king and state had seazd.
               Great Britons breast had now beene drownd in blood,
               Rac'd, sackt, and spoyl'd, bereft of euery good.
               Theft, murther, Rape, and euery act of hell,
               Had built their house on Englands face to dwell.
               The spoile of man, of humane race the shame,
               Would haue rac'd out all humane vertues name.
               Vilde dissolutes, prophane, and insolent,
               Like Tirants would haue wrong'd the innocent.

               That Heauens impression vildely rauished.
               Oh what a terror should their hearts haue felt,
               When vilde ones would, with them haue vildely delt.
               Euill to suppresse, when Iustice sturd had beene,

               In the Kings name wee charge, lets be obeyd.

               Sweete Prince he should, with King & Queene haue died.

               The honor'd Councell, might help the iust to saue,
               For King, Queene, Prince, & them, was made one graue.
               Then to the Lords, and Bishops of the land,
               They with the rest had dyed by treasons hand.

               They with the rest, had beene at once destroyed.

               With bibles then, should faithfull preachers presse,
               And breath forth, iudgments gainst sinnes wickednes.
               And saie, Behold, heauens indignation feare,
               This booke of God, doth Gods fierce wrath declare.
               The rage which should, from Romishe flames haue fum'd,
               Would quickly haue them and their books consum'd.
               Oh then of whom should iustice help require,
               All these Consum'd by flame of rutheles fire.
               No age makes record, of so foule a sinne,
               Since god did first to frame this world begyn.

                  But now behold, the fruites of Romish faith,
               And know for truth, what Popish doctrine saith.
               Of binding, and of loosing, Popes haue got,
               A strength, which knittes of euery euill the knot.
               And makes damnation seeme saluation sure,
               If so thereby Rome may her gaine procure,
               What most she craues, is euery course to take,
               How best she may her selfe. worlds Monarch make.
               The Pope that saith himselfe, worlds God to be,
               Speakes truth, for so's the deuill as well as he.
               But Pope from Peter doth deriue his race,
               And saith, to him belongs the keyes of grace.
               And he Christs vicar, of all Gods church the head,
               Must be supreame, all Kings his frowne must dread.
               With any oath, he can at large dispence,
               And at his pleasure, pardon each offence.
               Aboue Gods word, he doth himselfe auow,
               And his construction, must the world allow.
               True Christians, they onely his doctrine likes,
               And all the rest are damned Heretikes.
               Gainst this, the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda cries,
               And tels the Pope, that like a diuell he lyes.
               But still the Pope will keepe heauens golden gate,
               And doth from thence, Kings excomunicate.
               No King on earth, must haue his name inrold.
               Vnlesse that first on him his Crowne he hold.
               And al the world, that on his sea not dwels,
               Are Ethnicks, Pagans, faithlesse Insidels.
               
               Those that not grow vpon his stock intire,
               Are branches wilde, fit for destructions fire.
               Such hath he power, to any death to put,
               And from lifes tree, those saplesse twigs to cut.
               
                  Without the Church, as Iewes and Turkes they be,
               That will not yeeld to his supremacie.
               And Popish Romaines, they are taught to know,
               It lawfull is to worke their ouerthrow.
               That will not yeeld obedience to the Pope,
               In whose behalfe is giuen so large a scope,
               That Traytors doe for heauenly merite hope,
               Though thence the deuill doth pluck them in a Rope.
               If for Romes sake, they kill their lawfull King,
               Bald iades for them, shall trotting trentalls sing.

                   they did,
               For Saints at Rome shall be canonized.
               The Pope such power vnto himselfe doth take,
               As he, a diuell, a Saint, can quickly make.
            
            
               Heere briefely see, the power of Rome set downe,
               Aboue the world, himselfe, himselfe doth crowne,
               Aboue Gods word, and sacred Lawes diuine,
               The monsters proud, ambitious steps doe clime.
               And from his seate of blasphemie hath flowne,
               The fire that should haue King and Realmes vp blowne.
               Villaines that would the world in sunder riue,
               Say for Religions sake, they did contriue
               That damned plot; oh hellish insolence!

               The actors in a worke more then Tyrannicall,

               The Pope might them, for faithfull Christians take,
               When what they did, was for religions sake.
               Their plot found out, the very place to sack,
               Where all the lawes were made, that wrought their wrack.
               And this conceit in them, a hope prefers,
               They should be thought, Gods iustice ministers.
               These Realmes with Rome, in vnion to vnite,
               Was all the cause, for which their hopes did fight.
               For Romes auaile, and for the Church her good,
