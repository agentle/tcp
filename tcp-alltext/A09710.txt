ble Venus, till all the States ſmile at him, if your Glances be not too full of yron-moulds, I preſume you will fling one ſmile at our button-Cap, and I wiſh no higher:
            For
            
               A ſmile is constant and doth gild each Stile:
               But laughter is the Foole of euerie ſmile.
            
            The wonders we entreat of here haue little harme in them, you may take more hurt in a Barbers ſhop, if you ſit there faſting, than all my prognoſticating Comedie, or comicke Prognoſtication aymes at, and if theſe Euents chaunce to happen, they will bee but merrie ones, for they wiſh il to none, but to thoſe that wiſh ill to themſelues, and none can iuſtly except at this, but thoſe that cannot well read it, for there is great difference betweene reading and reading wel, for thoſe that read wel haue a good tongue of their owne, and ſpoile nothing in the ſpelling, and to ſuch I caſt vp my Cap, both in Paules-churchyard, Popeshead Alley, and at Temple-barre.

                  ❧ MIHILL MERcurie the Pothecarie in praiſe of the Booke.
            
            IF I haue skill,
            This Booke's not ill,
            But chaſt and pleaſant:
            If I knew the Author,
            I ſweare by my Daughter,
            I'de giue him a Pheaſant.
            Nor doe you wonder
            You writers of Thunder,
            I know not the Poet.
            Tis the Bookes prayſe I write,
            But I would not for a mite
            Haue hee himſelfe know it.
            For if hee ſhould ſpye it,
            I'de flatly deny it,
            He would fret, chafe, & Neſtle.
            Stampe more in a minute
            Then I in a Sennet
            At home with my Peſtle.
            Therefore my beſt way
            Is, not long heere to ſtay,
            Becauſe I'me no fighter.
            
               
This courſe then I tooke,
            To commend the Booke,
            But not meddle with the writer:
            And becauſe his Art
            Is ſo pretty and tart,
            And his inke ſo well ſauourd,
            I ſweare by my ſimples,
            A Noſe full of pimples
            Is verie ill fauourd:
            For ſo he doth prognoſticate, and ſhowes
            A white flaxe beard waſts with a fierie Noſe.
            See where he comes, I dare not ſtay, I flye:
            So:
            All Enuies poyſon goe with Mercurie.
            
            The ſame Hand againe.
         
      
      
         
            
            PLATOES Cap.
            
               THE Reuolution of this preſent yeere 1604, takes his beginning, at what time the Sun enters into the firſt minute of Aries, when many a ſcold ſhall be found in Ramme-Alley, whoſe tongues will neuer linne iangling, vntill the Sunne enter into another Signe, as the Myter, or rather ſome bowzing Tappe-houſe, where they muſt all drinke themſelues friends againe, till they are able to ſpeak no more than a drownd

Rat, and then by that time, I hope they will be quiet.
            Next I find, that the Sunne entring into Taurus, it will bee exceeding good this yeere for the Butchers both in Southwarke, Eaſtcheape, and Saint Nicholas Shambles, for hee takes his entrance iuſt vpon Eaſter Tueſday, to the depoſing of Lent, and the ouerthrow of ſalt Sammon, and freſh Cod, and to the reſtoring againe of Heroick-valiant Beefe, that ancient and ſurly Courtier, that neuer appeares without a meſſe of Muſtard his Gentleman-vſher bareheaded before him: Red Herring may goe hange himſelfe then for a Tweluemonth vppon the ruſty beame of ſome Farmers chimney, vntill the hungry Ploughboyes cut him downe and quarter him: for Oliuer Offall the Butcher will bee fatte and flouriſh, and Gregorie Gizzern the Poulter will bring foorth his Progenies of Partridges, Plouers, and Blackebirds, and what a pitifull ſight it will bee for poore Wayters and Trencher-bearers to ſee wiſe men their Maiſters feed vpon Woodcockes.
            
               
From thence the Sunne trauailes into Gemini, not into Germanie, (as ſome Mechanicke-readers will read Germanie for Gemini) and then Mayds beware of two at once, or two at a Birth, if you loue to preſerue your owne Credits, but you eſpecially this double ſigne threatnes moſt, that liue in Marchants houſes amongſt wanton Springals your Fellow-ſeruants, and are at midnight at the maſſacre, and ſacking of a Poſſet, when your ſober Maſter and continent Miſtres are in their firſt ſleepe, and little dreame of your Sinamon and Sugar, which are alwayes the two ſweete Preſenters of a Sack-Poſſet, the Sceane being layd in a Bowle, or a Baſon, and the Actors ſome halfe a dozen of ſiluer Spoones, which ſeldome are out of their parts, vntill all bee eaten: there is much perill and danger in this Signe, you Damoſels of ſeauenteene, and one and Twentie: therefore if I might counſell you, you ſhould bee your owne Pothecaries, and preſerue your honeſties better than Barberies: Goe to bed preſently after your Maſter and Miſtreſſe, ſaue candles and Candles,

pound, for there is craft nowe adayes in waighing of Candles, and great pollicie in the vttering of Puddings.
            Next the Sunne takes his Iourney into the ſtinging Signe Scorpio, and then beware of Brokers, Vſurers, and Pettifoggers the Scorpions of a kingdome, come not in their villaynous clutches all that Moneth eſpecially, for they will make you pay well for it, more in one Moneth, than you ſhall bee able to recouer againe a whole Tweluemonth after.
            But entring into Sagittarius, it will bee paſſing good for the Fletchers in Grubſtreet, and all the Caualeero Bowyers, twelueſcore Prickes will be in ſeaſon, and thoſe may ſhoote at Bun-hill, that are non-ſuited at Weſtminſter Hall.
            After this the Sunne mounts into Capricorne, and then woe bee vnto you that are Horne-madde, and haue three Acres at Cuckolds Hauen, you are well landed then, for one Acre there, is more than euer you will bee able to make away as longe as you liue: This Signe

raignes Ieloſie vppon men and women, vppon ould froſtie men that haue young luſtie wiues, and vppon ould riueld women, that haue young beardleſſe Huſbands, for the 
                  〈◊〉
                poyſon of Ieloſie ſwelles the boſomes of vnequall Bedfellowes, and a peece of a Vnicornes Horne can helpe any man but a Cuckold, whereby that ould moth-eaten Prouerbe is verified, which ſayes, One mans meate, is another mans poyſon: For if he ſhould take it downe, he would thinke it woulde breede more Hornes within him: ſuch is the ſtrange propertie of inuincible Ielouſie, that is ſtronger than the great Spaniſh Armado in Eightie eight.
            Next the Sunne enters into Aquarius, and then there will bee good dooings for Water-men, many wanton meetings at Brandford, freſh-water Voyages to Blacke-wall and Greenewich, reuelling and domineering among amiable Lads and young Wenches ouer the water: but that which I finde moſt lamentable in this watry Signe Aquarius, and moſt to be feared of all thoſe that loue valiant

Licour, is the ſingle-ſole diſpoſition of Brewers that will put to much Thames in their Beere, and I feare mee make it hop but of one legge, and that ſo lamely too, that a little thing will make it hoppe quite into the Thames againe: and becauſe Ale-brewers and they are Brothers, it is as much to bee doubted on the other ſide, that each Ale-brewer will play the Iewe of Malta, and put but a little Malt in the Ale: ſo I hope there will bee fewer Red-noſes this yere than was of a Yeere a great while, amongſt the baſer Ranke, and as for Tauerne-whiffers. I doe not thinke but the honeſt vertuous Vintners will take an order, and aſſwage the deſperate and furious humors of their Wines, with a good ſober quantitie of faire temperate Water: nor can I much blame them, for after the Reckoning hath been diſcharged and all, you ſhould haue ſome caſt it vp againe before the Vintners face, and thinke themſelues miſreckoned in the Pottle, vntill they ſee two Gallons apparently lye vppon the floare before their eyes, and then

they will beleeue it, and therefore good ſober Vintners I will not condemne, but rather applaud the watring of your Wine: for by that honeſt-profitable policie, thoſe that are your common Wineſuckers will ſurfette and bee ſicke tenne times, ere they bee drunke once, and ſo much for the Sunnes taking Barge in Aquarius.
            
            The Twelfe and laſt, is when hee turnes golden Angler, and catches Piſces, and then woe bee vnto you that are diſſolute full mouth'd Swearers, for you will neuer catch Haddockes as longe as you breath, for you ſhall neuer heare a true Fiſher indeede, ſweare beyonde Coddes-fiſh, and no oath at all that hath any fleſh in it: In this laſt and finnye Signe Piſces, there will bee odde dooinges in ould Fiſh-ſtreete, Lobſters will bee no meate for Lobcockes, as long as they paſſe for two Shillinges apeece, Maydes will bee no Fiſh for Harlotts, nor Soles for Brokers, the one wanting continence and the other conſcience, marry Gudginnes will bee your onely Diſh for

Countrey Gentlemen, ſuch as are come to their Landes, before they come to their Witte, and are one and Twentie yeare ould in Acres, but ſcarce ſcauen in diſcretion or manners, ſuch as theſe may fitly dwell at Fiſhers Folly, when they haue made away all their Fiſh Pondes in the Countrey, and this ſhall ſuffize for the Sunnes Twelue ſtrides into the Twelue Signes.
         
         
            NOW FOR GENErall diſpoſitions in all Rancks of people whatſoeuer, bred by variable, womaniſh, and vnconſtant Planets.
            
            
               THe great coniunction of Saturne and Iupiter, changed from the watrie Triplicity to the fierie, is to bee noted ſpecially (as our Prognoſticators

would haue it) neuertheleſſe I hope there will be ſmall hurt done by fire this yeere, becauſe Faggots, Billets, and Char-cole beare ſuch a price, that no poore ſnake is able to purchaſe them, and the moſt daunger for fire lyes in their Cottages, becauſe for the moſt part they are lowe, ould, and rotten, and as for rich men they could build vp their houſes againe: but thoſe which moſt preuent this great and ſi
                  •
               rie Coniunction, are Vſurers, and Niggards, both which are ſure to haue no ſparkle flying, or lying about their houſes, for they will haue neuer a cole in their chimneys.
            This hotte Coniunction being but badly affected, ſhewes, that thoſe which were widdowes the laſt Yeere, will be catcht vp this yeere, more for wealth and ſpending-money, than for loue and honeſty, they ſhall haue many gallant ſuiters, that will carie all their Lands vpon their backes, and yet ſweare they haue grounds, Backſides, & yards, when they haue no more Ground thā the Kings high way, no more Backſides than one, and no

Tauerne-potts ſhall flye from one end of the Roome to the other, and doe much hurt, if they light vppon mens Pates: Many crackt Crownes ſhall paſſe currant thorough Cheape-ſide by Goldſmith ſtalles, and yet neuer ſuſpected: Many terrible Frayes in Smithfield between ſergeants and Gentlemen, marrie ſergeants will winne the day, and get the Victorie, eſpecially if they bee ſixe to one, then there is no remedye but the Counter in Woodſtreete muſt part the fray: there ſhall bee a dreadfull warre betweene the wife and the huſband for Superioritie, in ſo muche that the good man ſhall be faine to giue ouer firſt, cry mum, and let her doe what ſhee will all the yeere after.
            Shrewd Tempeſts ſhall ariſe about Cole-harbour, and many a maide ſhall be caſt away about Weſtminſter: there ſhal be a Battaile between the feure knaues at Cards for ſuperioritie, and between falſe Dice and true, for antiquitie.
            Women that weare longe gownes ſhall bee glad to take vp their cloathes in the ſtreet, when it raynes, although a

hundred men ſtand and looke vppon them, yet they ſhall bluſh no more to hold them vp if it bee verie durtie, then men to make water in broad day at the Piſſing Conduit if they haue need.
            The Bakers, Woodmongers, Butchers, and Brewers, ſhall fall to a mightie conſpiracie this yeare, ſo that no man ſhall haue bread, fire, fleſh, or drinke without credite or readie monney: Barbers ſhall be mightily out of worke this yeere, by reaſon of the French diſeaſe, for many ſhall looſe their Haire, before they can come to their ſhops, and ſo put them quite out of worke: and Beards ſhall bee Commodities hard to bee gotten, but more hard to bee kept, for many haires will ſtart out this yeere that will neuer come in againe, but periſh and droppe downe by the way: And amongeſt all other Trades and Occupations, Maſons poore ſoules ſhall be much troubled with the Stone this yeere, if there chaunce to bee any great Buildings, as by my ſkill I finde no leſſe: marrie I doubt Powles will ſcarce haue a new Steeple this yeere,

and in that, I thinke I ſhall bee the trueſt Prognoſticator, that writ Almanackes this twentie Twelue-months: The Gowt, I find, will keepe a foule Racket this yeere, and play at Tennis in a Vſurers puft Toe, but his gaping Sonne and Heire ſhall haue little hope of his dying, i'le put him in that Comfort, becauſe hee may linger yet aboue Seauen yeeres longer, and his Toe ſerue out aboue foure Prentiſhips to the Gowt.
            Taylors ſhall bee mightily troubled with the ſtich, and ſowe many falſe ſeedes which ſhall peepe out, before a Moone come about, and hauing a Hell of their owne, beeing but a bare boord betweene, woe bee to peeces of white Fuſtian-linings, for they fall in with their heeles vpward, Satten is the cheefeſt Diuell there, and domineeres ouer all inferiour Blackes. Veluet that ould Reueller and braue Courtier, lyes there moſt tragically diſmembred, poore Perpetuano is perpetually damn'd, and deſperate Raſh fals in headlong.
            
               
               Onely in this all Taylors are moſt true,
               They damne falſe bodies, & giue them their due.
            
            And what a lamentable thing it is on the other-ſide, that ſo many of our Engliſh women ſhould weare French Bodies, and be a ſcorne and by-ieſt to all riotous Nations.
            But ſhal I diſcouer to the world wondrous euents indeed, and tell how Muſcadine in Vintners Sellers ſhall indite their Maiſters this yeere of Commixtion, and arraigne them at their owne Barre: and how Bayliffes and Marſhals men ſhall bee content to arreſt any man, if they can catch him.
            Poore men ſhall be accounted Knaues without occaſion, and thoſe that flatter leaſt, ſhall ſpeede worſt, and neuer bee woorth Three Hundred a yeere, if they ſhould liue vntill Doomes-day: Many ſhall eate vppon other mens Trenchers, and ſurfette vppon other mens Coſts, but ſcarce feede vppon Holland Cheeſe in their owne Chambers.
            The Palſey will be a verie ſhrewd

diſeaſe this yere, for ſome ſhall haue it in their heads, and ſhake ſo long till they haue no more wit in their braines then Wil. the Bel-ringer: ſome ſhall haue a Palſey in their Teeth, in ſo much that they ſhall eat more in a weeke, then they wil be able to pay forin a twelue-moneth, Otherſome ſhall be troubled with a Palſey in their hands, and thoſe are your riotous elder Brothers that can keepe nothing faſt, but will ſhake all the monney out of their handes that comes in to them, Videlicet, in Tauernes, Tenniſcourts, and Dicing-houſes, and laſtly ſome ſhall haue a Palſey in their feete, and will not bee able to ſtand to any thinge but ſhake and reele from the ſtall into the Channell, your excellent Reele-pots, and ſo I leaue them full in a puddle.
            Some there ſhall bee which ſhall haue ſuch a ſmell in their Noſtrils that no Feaſt ſhall eſcape them without they haue ſhare in it.
            But Conſumptions this Yeere are dangerouſly threatned, by the fierie copulation of thoſe two ſurly & ambitious

Planets, for ſome ſhall bee ſo conſumed in their members, as they ſhall finde neuer a good Tongue in their heads, ſome ſo conſumed in conſcience, that they will take aboue Fortie in the Hundred, and more too if they can get it, otherſome ſo conſumed by inchaſtity, that if the Conſtable ſhould ſearch them, hee ſhould finde about them verie little honeſtie.
            Thoſe that ſinge Baſes this yeere ſhall loue to take their licour ſoundly, and Trumpeters that ſound Trebles ſhall ſtare by cuſtome.
            There ſhall be many Fortune-tellers, that ſhall ſhut a Knaue in a Circle, and looking about for a Diuell finde him lockt in their boſomes.
            Many ſtraunge euents ſhall happen and befall this yeere in thoſe houſes where Virgo is predominant with a maſter, but wants a Miſtreſſe to looke narrowly vnto her, for the influence of the Grocers ſhops being eleuated within a few ſweet degrees preſageth that ſome ſhameleſſe Drabbes ſhall bee ſtill gadding about the ſtreetes for figges, almonds,

and Confects, and that without regarde of eyther Witte or Honeſtie.
            Great Miſtes and Fogges will ariſe and fall this yeare, ſo that ſome ſhall not ſee but to take their Neighbours bed for their owne, and if Watchcandles could tell tales, they would make you laugh, though your wiues went to burying.
            Many men ſhal be ſo venterouſly diſpoſed, that they ſhall go into Brothelhouſes, and yet come out againe as honeſtly, as when they went firſt in.
            Bakers ſhall thriue by two thinges this yeare, ſkores well payed, and Millers that are honeſt, which are as rare to bee founde now a dayes, as blacke Swannes, and white Rauens. Long bearded men ſhall not bee the wiſeſt: nor the moſt graueſt in lookes, the moſt holy in life.
            The Haberdaſhers by the naturall operation of this coniunction, are very fortunate. For olde Hats new trunde ſhall not laſt long, and new Hats for the moſt part ſhall haue olde trimming: and ſo by

this meanes foyſting Iohn ſhall thriue better by his knauerie, then any plaine dealing Iohn about London by the Talent of his honeſtie: and ſo I end, wiſhing all the Felts in his ſhop no more wickedder Blocke then his owne Pate, and then I am ſure they will be ſo farre from good faſhion, that no honeſt man in England woulde bee hyred to weare them: and ſo farewell Iohn, tis good lucke ſome times they ſay, to end with a &c.
         
         FINIS.
