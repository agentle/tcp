               1 Of Disloyaltie.
               
                  WHat our friends
counsell vs, is
left vnto our
owne discretion,
to do or leaue vndon▪
but what a Religious
Prince commandeth, that

of force must bee performed;
It is well said of
Samuel, that Rebellion is as
the sinne of Witchcraft, for
as the Witch knowing
the Deuill to bee the Father
of lies, yet will trust
him: So the disobedient
knowing, that he oweth
all good loyalty to the
King, will yeeld none vnto
him: These haue made
mercy a warrant for sinn,
which is onely a warning
from sinning, busying
themselues (with Haman)
to prouide their owne
gallowes: Zimry, who
slew his master, had no
peace; the Earth cloue asunder,

and swallowed
vp rebellious Corah and
his faction, it was at
once an executioner and
a graue vnto them: Plutarch
well obserues, that
all those who had any
hand in the conspiracy against
Caesar, did come to
bloudy ends; and Cassius
one of the conspirators,
slew himselfe with the
same Dagger wherewith
he wounded Caesar.
               
               
                  They that resist shall receiue
to themselues iudgement,
Rom. 13. 2. acquirunt
sibi damnationem, as
the vulgar reades it; they
doe not onely receiue,

but pull vpon themselues
heauy iudgements; Kings
are Gods by deputation:
he who resisteth their authority
resisteth Gods ordinance,
for the powers
that be, are ordained of
God. Traianus is commended
for that saying of
his, when hee gaue the
sword vnto a chiefe Officer.
Hoc pro me vtere, si iusta
imperauero, contra me si
iniusta: Yet Dauid would
not lay violent hands vpon
Saul (though none of
the best Kings) because
he was the Lords annointed.
The rule of Augustine
is good, Bonus si fuerit

qui tibi praeest nutritor,
tuus est, malus si fuerit tentator, tuus est, & nutrimēta libenter
accipe & in tentatione
approbare: Ser. 6. dev. D: sec.
Mat. So there must be no
rebelling: good Gouernors
we must obey willinglingly,
bad ones wee
must endure patiently:
Gods ordinance must not
be resisted, no not for the
personable crimes of
those who supply the seat
of Iustice, but rather bee
obeyed, because they
beare diuinity about thē,
and the sparkes of Gods
Maiesty remaines in some
measure in euery Maiestrate.
               
                  
The image and superscription
of a Prince stamped
in base mettall is currant
among his Subiects,
as well as that which is
made in the finest siluer,
though indeede it be not
so precious. Saint Peter
1. 2. 18. admonisheth seruants,
and vnder that title
Subiects, to be obedient
in all feare, not onely, to
the good and gracious,
but also, to the froward.
Iulian was an infidell Emperour,
an Apostata, an Idolater,
yet the Christian
Soldiers serued the Infidell
Emperor; but when
he would haue them worship

Idols, they preferred
God before him: In such
a case it is better to obey
God then man:Aug 
                  Hic contemne
potestatem, timendo
potestatem. But when Iulian
led those Souldiers against
an enemy, they
presently obeyed him,
propter Domiuum eternum
subditi etiam erant domino
temporali: Aug. de Psalm.
124. If nothing plucketh
downe sooner then that
which promiseth an vntimely
ende; Let no man
thinke that God wil leaue
that vnpunished in vs,
which he hath not pardoned
in our betters.
            
            
               
               2 Of Sermon-hearers.
               I Obserue three sorts of
Sermon-hearers, one
of which, I may not vnfitly
call indifferent professors;
these walke (like
Nicodemus) in the twilight
of their Infolded
Faith, and not vnlike that
white liuered Iewe, Ioh. 9.
which chose rather to
conceale his knowledge
of Christ then to bee put
out of the Sinagogue;
and so it fareth with euery
lanus in Religion. These
haue good cause to pray,
that by their wilfull blindnesse

they fall not with
Iudas into that euerlasting
night, whilest for
their euening repentance,
their be found with God
no place of acceptance.
These Heare-Sermons,
as trauellers in the time
of the Law, might take
Grapes, eate some for the
present time, but carry away
none with them.
               A second sort are such,
as being tempestiously
carried with the violence
of their owne affections,
doe come to Church, as
did the Athenians, to
heare newes, whose itching
eares would haue

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
scratching doctrine; they
thinke not the word of
God to bee his power to
saluation, except it be deliuered
by a Chaplaine of
their owne choosing.
               Such Ammons of the
people cannot be perswaded
to let any cakes goe
downe but those of Thamars
baking. If others
looke but into the Pulpit,
presently they cry out against
him as those did against
Paul. Quid vult seminilegus
dicere; They
hold it lawfull to checke
their Teacher, as they
taunt their Tailor, if hee
fit them not with a Sermon

of the fashion.
               The last in place, but
the first in price, are zealous
Protestants, who
being backed by the holy-Ghost,
doe resemble
their Father Abraham,
with a fire in one hand,
and a knife in the other,
to figure their full resolution,
to affect what God
affecteth, hauing their
hearts bleeding at their
eyes in sorrowe for their
sinnes.
               If a Rauen bring these
men food with Elias,
they will receiue and eate
it. Dum cadunt eundo, cauent
cadendo: they loose

not the faculty of going,
but learne to looke better
to their feete by falling:
though their braines
should bee beaten out of
their heads, yet the iustifying
Faith is neuer banished
out of their hearts.
They are as willing to
suffer euill, as to receiue
good at the hands of
God: else were they guilty
of charging God foolishly;
like good N
                        •
                     aboth
they are ready and willing
to defend the Vine
with their heart-blood:
whilst others (being but
Comedians in Religion)
act in voice & gesture diuine

vertues, but in the
course of their liues renounce
the persons and
parts they play: These
with Simeon take Christ
in their armes by Faith,
and carry him about in
their liues by a holy conuersation,
hauing learned
that the practike knowledge
of the Scriptures, is
the perfect knowledge of
them, and the art of doing
that saues the soule.
            
            
               3. Of Atheisme.
               A Theisme not daring
to say with Rabsaketh
that our God deceiueth

vs, as an Imposture,
like enuy creepeth closely,
where it dares not appeare
openly: In corde
dixit insipiens non est Deus:
Diagoras was but a foole
for saying so; if hee had
but asked the heauens
they would haue told
him that they are the
worke of Natures God.
The world is a faire table
wherein God hath drawn
and imprinted himselfe
in so many Charrecters
and legible letters, as the
simplest man liuing may
read and vnderstand the
same, and by the greatnesse
of the beauty of the

creature may the Creator
thereof bee seene and
knowne. Those who in
old time were accounted
Atheists, some of them rather
iested at the falsehood
& number of their
owne Idols, then denied
the being of one true
God. Socrates, who was
pronounced by the Oracle
of Apollo to bee the
wisest man of all, was put
to death for iesting at the
number and multitude of
Gods amongst the Heathens.
Though there be
some such fooles which
suffer their hearts to bee
diuorced from the know
               
            
            
               
                  〈2 pages missing〉
               
               
               selfe is vnfruitfull, and
like the Vine vnprooued,
runnes foorth into many
superfluous stemmes and
branches: nothing on
mans part but a holy and
vertuous education can
make it fruictifie; goodnesse,
although it may be
repaired in our selues, yet
it cannot bee propagated
vnto ours: very seldome
doe men see the sonnes
of excellent men, excellent:
vice is propagated
not vertue: Euen the
clearest graine sends forth
that chaffe from which it
was fanned before the
sowing.
               
                  
Yet many Parents take
more care to leaue their
Children rich in goods
then in goodnesse, by
reason whereof, their riches
make them retchlesse;
For comming to
their Inheritance too
young, their heads being
as full of folly, as their
purses of money, They
(like the Prodigall Son)
consume all in riotous liuing:
so giuing their Parents
iust cause to complain,
as Tiberius once did
of his Sonne Caligula,
that he had brought him
vp to bee the ruine of his
House. This mischiefe,

good and Religious education
will helpe to preuent:
Socrates confesseth
that with the study of
Philosophy he had made
dull and blunt his dishonest
inclinations; those
infectious and venemous
qualities which are in the
springs of youth, the falt
of good education will
helpe to cure: for want of
this, Parents, who haue
named their Sons Caine,
a Possession, in the end
find them to be Abell,
Losse and Vanity.
            
            
               
               5. Of the Commons.
               
                  POpulari vento nihil inconstantius;
for the
Commons (as vnstable as
quicksiluer) fawning on a
man will make him a
King to day, and a Begger
to morrow: Seianus
in the forenoone was so
fauoured and followed
by the people, that they
would haue made him
their Caesar, yet hated him
so much in the afternoone,
that they sent him
as a malefactor vnto prison;
The same Antiochus
was at one time saluted

both 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a
glorious Prince, and a furious
Tirant. Homer (as
blind as hee was) sawe as
much; hee compares the
disposition of the common
people to the standing
corne, there comes
a puffe of wind & blowes
it all on the one side, there
comes another blast and
swayes it as much on the
other side. It is a fit comparison
made by that
Kingly Prophet: It is the
Lord that stilleth the rage
of the Sea, the noise of the
waues, and the madnesse of
the people. Psal: 65. Agreeing
therein with the Prophet

                  Esay, Chap: 17. 12.
Where the nature of the
people is compared to
the billowes of the working-sea
that cannot rest;
so easily set agog, so delighted
with nouelties, so
full of alteration & chang
are the affections of the
common people: The
Mariner may aswell wrap
vp the winde in his saile-cloth,
and keepe it for
another voyage, as the
Prince can mannage the
vntamed multitude; those
mouthes which cryed,
Hosanna, at the first, cryed
out ere long, Crucifige.
               
            
            
               
               6. Of bribing.
               THe best Gouernours
are not all-seeing
Gods, for Gehezi wil haue
a bribe, though he serue a
most reuerend Master, of
him none can expect a
blessing, vntill with Isaack
hee hath felt your
hands; all his sences being
turned into feeling:
He speakes to poore suitors,
as that olde strumpet
in Plautus did to a worneout
Customer of hers,
(who asked dayes of payment
for his pleasure)
oculatae nostrae sunt manus,

credunt quod vident: people
of our trade haue eyes
in their hands, they beleeue
nothing but what
they see. Petty Officers
diue deepe into poore
suitors purses, for spinning
out a short subiect
into a long matter, they
doe bring in a large reckoning
for much needelesse
writing; And yet as timesellers,
the Clarke causeth
the poore Clyent to pay
for expedition too, when
the suite hath depended
seauen yeares before:
This often causeth both
an ebbe and a flood both
in an hower, the emptying

of the Clyents purse,
being the full, filling of
the Clarkes, who like Gehezi
when he receiueth a
bribe, belieues hee receiueth
a blessing: but as
there lay a curse vnder
Gehezi his hoping for blessing
(as he felt to his own
cost, when the Leprosie
of Naaman cleaued vnto
him,) So there is a curse
vnder their blessing; For
fire (as Iob speaketh) shall
deuoure the houses of
bribes, Iob. 15. 34. It was a
worthy answere made by
the Heathenish Prince
Tiberius to a polling Customer
of his, that thoght

to haue highly pleased
him with racking his subiects,
and exacting great
summes: Meum tondèri
pecus volo non deglubi: It
is the property of these
vnder-hand dealers to pretend
great husbandry for
their Maisters, and double
diligence in their seruice.
               Vnder which colour
they practise their iniquity
without check or controulement,
I referre such
to that threatning of the
Lord in the Prophet. I
will visit all those that stand
vpon the threshold so proudly,
which fill their Maisters

houses by cruelty and deceit:
Zephan: 1. 9. The
Throne of King Salomon
had Lyons carued about
it to declare a kinde of
Maiesty and grauity in
the steppes of it; not Rauens,
not Wolues, Birds
and Beasts of prey. So
should great mens seruants,
and Officers of Iustice,
bee Lyons in shewe
for grauity; yet harmeles
as those Images about Salomons
Seate, rather terrible
to them that stand aloofe,
then hurtful to any
who haue occasion to
come neare.
            
            
               
               7. Of Vsury.
               THis sinne of vnlawfull
getting vnlawful
gaine is as the forbidden
Tree; for men hauing many
honest Trades to get
their liuing by Gods ordinance,
yet they vse indirect
meanes, turning
the Princes tolleration
into an imparatiue law,
like them Math: 19. Who
saide vnto our Sauiour,
Moses commanded, when
of force hee was faine to
suffer diuorcements to auoide
further inconneniences.
This sinne is like

                  Salomons louing of strang
women. 1. Reg: both estrange
men and turne
their hearts from the loue
of God, and enrich their
bodies with the sinne of
their soules; for Faenus pecuniae,
funus animae. This is
hee who maketh something
of nothing, mauger
the head of naturall Philosophy;
for hee maketh
that breede and encrease,
which by nature is barren
and vnapt to encrease. Basil
tearmes Vsury a beast
of a strange and monsterous
nature, because in
bringing foorth it differs
from other Creatures,

which hee sheweth because
other creatures
haue a time to bring forth
perfect young, but the vsurers
money is borne to
day, & to day begins to
bring foorth. They say
hat Hares (saith Basil:
Hom: aduers. vsur.) at one
time do litter, giue sucke,
and are with young. So
the Vsurers mony at one
time is put to vsury, and
borne, and breeding.
               Albeit this sinne is contrary
to the feare of God,
Levit: 25. 36. and 15. A
forgetting of God. Ezech
22. 12. Albeit it shuts out
from Gods Tabernacle, Ps:
                  
15. And excludeth from
Eternall Life, and made
subiect to Eternall Death,
Ezech: 18. 13. Yet hetherto
all labour hath bin lost
in washing this blackemore.
            
            
               8. Of Pride.
               OVr Sauiour said that
silken rayment was
in Kings Courts, but now
it is in euery priuate house
where costly attire is vsed
as a net to catch King
Salomons fooles; Pride
(like a Dogge) hath licked
vp all the outcast fashions
that euery Nation

hath vomited.
               If his Maiesty should
banish (as did Licurgus)
all inuenters of new fashions,
I thinke the Land
would bee much vnpeopled,
The Prouerbe was,
the garment must bee
well made, that shall
please all; but now it is,
the garment must be well
made that shall please any
at all.
               Men now haue as
much labour to clothe
their Wiues, as Mercury
had to cloth the Moone;
Send they must to the Indians
for Silke to apparell
them, for Pearles (the

excretions of Shel-fish)
to adorne thē; for Smells
(the excrements of
beasts) to fume and sent
them; for Gold, (Iliaterrae)
to deck and lace them;
forgetting themselues to
be Daughters of Adam,
whom God at first turnd
out in a plaine leather
Suit.
               And if any of these be
chalenged for their excessiue
pride; they answere
(as Iulia did) wittily,
but not wisely; they
haue a care of their husbands
credit. In the mean
time, it robbeth the Master
of his money, the

Mistres of her honestie▪
for these fleeces of vanity
are banners of Pride and
nests of lust, one weares
a loosebodied gowne, an
other a gowne with a
loose body: Sometime
the Husband is proud of
his welath, like Haman,
whose pride ended on a
high paire of Gallowes:
sometime of his wife, as
Assuerus was of Vasthi
for her beauty.
               The Scripture mentioneth
but of one who
painted her face, and
soone after the doggs eat
her; nor but two, who
wore long haire, and it

was the destruction of
them both, which proueth
the Prouerbe true,
that which men make
their chiefe felicitie, doth
often prooue their heauy
desteny; Let no man fashion
himselfe like vnto
this world: howsoeuer
foolish men (like Ierobo
                     
                        •
                     m,)
worship a golden
Calfe; yet man, not God
looketh on the outward
appearance. He who with
Iacob desireth to get the
better blessing of our heauenly
Father; must (as Hagar
was commanded)
humble himselfe: there is
no nearer way to heauen,

no not for Princes; for
God resisteth the proud:
God and pride cannot
dwell in the same minde▪
which could not dwell in
the same heauen: & pride
once fallen from heauen,
ascends no more from
whence it is fallen.
            
            
               9. Of Couetousnes.
               IF wee may not trust in
the person or power of
Princes, who are stiled
Gods, much lesse should
mans confidence consist
in their siluer pictures,
seeing they either leaue
vs suddenly like Crates
                  
coyne, or Iobs substance;
Or we them, as did that
ouerioyed Penny-father.
Luk: 1
                     •
                  .
               The wisest King did
well compare the eager
holding of wealth to a
sore sicknes, which bringeth
paine to the partie
and griefe to his good
friends, God made the
world of naught because
men shuld set it at naught
not choaking themselues
with too much, nor suffering
others to pine with
want, but the couetous
not seeing what God
hath in store for them,
they take before-hand

what the world offereth
them, not caring how
they get so they haue
their desire.
               The wealth of these
men is vnto them, as the
wings of the Grassehopper
wherewith shee cannot
flie. It fareth with
these men as it doth with
the Sea-Eagle, Cum ferre
quod coepit nequeat in gurgitem
demergitur, being
not able to lift vp that
which shee fastened on,
she is drawne vnder water
and drowned: Dum
vultesse prado, fit praeda.
Aug: of the couetous; of
all, he is the most miserable

man in the world;
God abhorres him, hee
speaketh good saith Dauid
of the couetous whom God
abhorreth: for the couetous
man is an Idolater,
Ephes. 5, 5. He adores grauen
Images in his coyne,
Sculpturam ipsius nummi
colit: Heron: in Loc: Others
worship Aurum in
imagine, but the couetous
doth adore aurum in aerugine.
So Saint Iames speaketh.
Your Gold and Siluer
is cankered, and the rust of
them shall bee a witnesse against
you. Iam: 5. 3. Heauen
gates stand fast bard
against him, amongst

those who shall not inherit
the Kingdome of heauen.
Saint Paul reckoneth
Couetous, 1. Cor. 6. 10. the
Swallowes dung of this
world doeth so blind his
eyes: that as hee seeketh
not, so hee seeth not the
way to the Kingdome of
God. Fulgentius in his
Fable of Midas (who desired
Apollo, that euery
thing hee touched might
instantly bee turned into
gold) is so called in Greek,
Mida Quasi 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , because
couetousnes hath so
blinded his eyes that hee
cannot perceiue what is
for his owne good, nor

see to enter that Needles
eye of Gods Kingdome:
Men hate him, because
he is nemini bonus, good
to no man, He loueth to
Rake, the Shouell he cannot
indure, All his daies
he eateth in darkenesse. Ecc. 5. 16.
               Sleepe hee would but
cannot, Et motae ad Lunam
trepidabit arundinis
vmbram: His saciety wil
not suffer him to sleepe,
Eccles. 5. 11. If hee saw a
greater man then himself
in the day time, he thinketh
on him in the night,
and feares he wil oppresse
him▪ if hee saw a poorer

then himselfe, hee cannot
sleepe, for feare he should
rob him: Out of these
feares he starts vp, and asketh,
whether the doores
be barred, where be the
Keyes? at the least noise
he calls vp his seruant,
sends him then foorth,
bolts the doore after him,
and then studieth whether
it were better to keep
within doores, or goe
foorth and see.
               Eate he may, but will
not, one good meale, but
at his neighbours table:
corpus extenuat, vt lucrum
extendat; hee feareth to
eate, because hee feareth

in Albertus, which dares
not eate of the earth, for
feare hee should want
earth to eate.
               If he eateh it is commonly
of the worst and
coursest, like the Bakers
boy, though hee hath
White bread in his basket,
yet himselfe feedes
vpon browne. Amongst
his many wishes, one is
(that Camelion like) hee
could liue by the ayre:
nothing can more vexe
him then to heare that
Corne falls, or that there
is store of Danske Rye,
then could he hang himselfe,
but that hee is vnwilling

to cast away a little
money to buy a Cord.
What he enioyeth neuer
contents him: Like another
Ahab, hee is ficke
of his next neighbours
field: though his mouth
be full of Siluer, yet
like Peters Fish he is still
byting, still gaping to get
more.
               
                  His greedy affections
are like vnto Pharaohs
leane Kyne, of whom
the Text saith, When
they had eaten vp the fatt,
it could not bee knowne that
they had eaten them, but
they were still as euill-fauoured
as they were at the

                  beginning: Gens. 41. 21.
Vnto wealth hee esteemeth
no way (whether
it bee of fraude or violence)
to be indirect, for
Gaine is his godlinesse:
if▪ he haue goods enough,
he thinkes hee is good enough.
Trust him with
the poores stocke, and like
Iudas hee will robbe the
poore: If he be then to
cloth them, hee will doe
as Hanun did with Dauids
seruants, 2. Sam. 10.
Cut off their Garments
by the middle and reserue
the rest for a horsemans
Coate for himselfe
when he rides to the

Deuill.
               Vntil this earthworme
come vnto the earth, hee
minds nothing but earthly
things, like a Swine he
neuer doth good till his
death: as an Apprentices
box of earth, apt he is to
take all, but to restore
none till hee bee broken:
And hauing made
many beggers by Vsury
& oppression in his life; at
his death he will cōmand
his Executor to build
some Hospitall, as a monument
of his bloudy deuotion:
After hee hath
bought and sold Christ,
hee will buy a Field to

bury strangers in: I feare
this man, whilest with
Shemei hee runneth after
his seruants, his riches, in
forbidden wayes, in the
end will loose himselfe.
            
            
               10. Of the decay of
Hospitality.
               IT was St: August: complaint
long agoe, and
men may now take it vp:
Religio peperit diuitias et filia
deuor auit matrem: For
many Professors in these
times haue made all the
body a tongue, Ostentantes
non Ostendentes pietatem,
Abraham saide not
to the rich man, Memento
quod rapuisti, sed quod accepisti:
                  
So that the euill
vsing of what they haue
shall be a witnesse against
them, who notwithstanding
their great profession,
are but blessed thistles
and haue suffered their
handes to mocke their
tongues: There is great
reason that they should
doe more good then others;
who haue receiued
more goods then others.
Vnto whom-soeuer
much is giuen, of him shall
be much required, Luk: 12.
48. Moisture was not giuen
vnto springs that they
should remaine in the
places where they were

bred, but to be conueyed
by Conduits to the watering
of barren and drye
grounds.
               And Plato that Diuine
Phylosopher, had this conceit,
that Nature at the
first was deliuered of two
Daughters, Plenty and
Pouerty, to this ende, that
the one needing might
craue what shee lacked,
and the other abounding
might supplye all that
wanted. Diues factus est
propter pauperem, et pauper
propter diuitem, pauperis
est rogare, diuitis erogare▪
August: It is obserued
of Ioseph of Arim athea
                  
who buried our Sauiour,
that hee was a rich man,
and the reason why our
Sauiour would be buried
by the handes of a rich
man, was, to teach rich
men that they aboue all
others are bound to liberality
and workes of mercy,
because God aboue
others hath blessed them
with wealth, and plentie.
               A dutie too much forgotten
by many men who
N
                        •
                     abal-like, liue, as if
they were onely borne to
themselues and their Families.
The Iacke hath
turned Iohn out of doors;

where in the former
times (as at the poole of
Bethesda) the Orphan,
and the Widdowe, and
the poore haue found
comfort and reliefe: now
(as to Lazarus at the rich
mans gates) there is not
any one to giue them
crummes, for many haue
left faire houses without
any dwellers in them;
The poore must treade
their Winepresse, and yet
be a thirst, they finde no
more tast in them then in
the white of an egg, Cum
fame cruciantur Christi pau
                        •

nutriunt histriones, saide

                  Gregory of some in his
time; their like we haue
in ours, who when the
poore are pinched with
famine, they wastfully
spend their substance on
Rymers and Players;
This is not dispensare, but
dissipare, bona domini: the
creatures by them abused,
the pot, the pillowe,
the candle will accuse
them that they haue bin
vniust Stewards. These
men should imitate Iob, as
he did the Eagle, who is
so honourable that hee
eateth not his prey alone:
the thing that keepeth
rich men from giuing, is

a faithlesse feare that they
should lacke before they
die, When Dauid neuer
saw the righteous forsaken,
nor his seede begging their
bread.
               
               But so good is God vnto
them, that hee taketh
them away in the middest
of their Mammon,
ridding them of what
they are afraide of, and
prouiding for posteritie
what they haue neede of.
The Widdowe of Sarepta
might haue answered
Elias with her own want,
The Macedonians might
haue pleaded against St.
Paul, that they had sufficient

poore of their own
to receiue their reliefe;
but without delay these
did minister to their necessities;
knowing well;
hoc est hominem occidere, vitae,
ei subsidia denegare. This
it was that made our forefathers
so open-handed
as they were: with that
good Samaritan they neuer
passed by any wounded
man, without some
compassion.
               To doe good, and to
distribute, to lodge strangers
they were not forgetfull,
for thereby some
haue receiued Angels into
their houses vnawares,

                  Heb. 13. 2. They knewe,
Non quod abstulerit aliena,
sed quod non donarit sua,
the rich Glutton is not
tormented in hell, for
that he did hurt, but because
hee did not helpe
poore Lazarus: when
he did begge a drop of
water in Hell to coole his
tongue, God would not
heare him, because when
Lazarus begged of him
on earth, hee would not
helpe nor reliue him; Audiant
ista diuites qui nolunt
esse misericordes; Audiant
irrogari supplicia, qui nolunt
erogare subsidia. Giue
vnto euery man that asketh,

is our Sauiours
counsell, Luke 6. 30.
               Plenty shall furnish the
Table, where Charity
takes away, and giueth to
the poore. Rich mens
goods (like those fiue Barlye
Loaues and two Fishes
which that little boy
did beare Iohn 6.) Clausa
onerabunt, reclusa recreabunt:
Hee who demandeth
mercy, and sheweth
it not, is like vnto him
who ruines a Bridge, ouer
which hee himselfe is

               11 Of Gluttony and
Drunkennesse.
               ALthough pot Companions
be seldome
good Trencher-men, yet
here I will yoake these
beastes together, they
both vsurping Sobrieties
Kingdome, as Adoniah
did Salomons. There are
in this Land an infinite
number of these vaine
persons, which passe vnder
the title of true Troians
and boon Companions:
They will pay their Host
for their superfluous

drinke, sooner then for
any other debt; whereby
it comes to passe, that
when mony faileth, they
can drinke vppon their
credit, chalke being as
good payment with them
as ready money. Their
first Sacrifice is offered
to Bacchus, they will bee
in the Tauerne, or Tipling-house,
before they
come to Gods house.
               These thinke no Wine
good which is brought ouer
two thresholds; Amongst
them there is a
kinde of accursed emulation,
for the expert drunkard,
counts it a great disgrace

that another should
be druncke before him,
Mensuras sine mensura;
Measures are now drunck
without measure, healths
without health. Habebitur
aliquando ebrietati honor,
et plurimum meri cepisse,
virtus erit, said Seneca
long since, the time
shall come when honour
shall bee ascribed vnto
drunkennes, & to drinck
much wine shall be held
a vertue, that time is
come, non hahet vlterius
quod nostris potibus addat
posteritas, there are those
of whom wee may say
that which was spoken of

the Emperour Bonosus,
Non vt viuat natus est, sed
vt bibat. He it was who
(hauing strangled himselfe
with a halter) was
thus iested at by the people.
Amphoram pendêre,
non hominem: But woe to
those who rise vp early to
follow drunckennesse: Esai:
5. 11. Crates throwing his
money into the Sea said,
I will drowne thee, that I
may not bee drowned of
thee.
               But Drunckards so
drown their money, that
themselues are drowned
with it, Dum absorbet vinum
absorbetur a vino. Amongst

these accusationis
occasio est (saide Hierom
long since) adiuratum
per Caesarem frequentius
non bibisse; Who will not
bee druncke for Caesar, is
thought no friend to Caesar.
               
               Our Sauiour seekes to
beat men from this sinne
with a take-heede vnto
your selues. Luk: 21. 34.
For this sinne robbes a
man of himselfe, and
laies a beast in his roome.
Noahs nakednesse is seene
in his Wine, drunckennes
doeth both make imperfections,
and shewe those
wee haue to the eyes of

euery scoffing Cham: To
whom is strife, To whom
is woe? saith Salomon, Euen
to those who tarry long
at the Wine: Prou: 
                        •
                     3. 29.
For Drunckards are commonly
quarrelsome. Bacchus
(tearmed by the
Heathens the God of
Wine) is painted with
hornes, to signifie that
druncken men are euer
pushing and quarrelling.
Men herein are like Elephants,
If once made
druncke, they presently
growe angry, and fall a
fighting: Alexander in
his cuppes kild his deare
friend Clitus: Saint Aug:

ad fratres eremo. serm: 33.
reports of a young man
the sonne of Cyrillus, who
being drunke, rauisht
his Mother, kild his Father,
and wounded two
of his Sisters vnto the
death. Nunquam egoebrium
putabo castum, said Ierome;
A drunckard will
soone become wanton.
Saint Paul, hauing perswaded
from gluttony
and drunckennesse, Rom:
13. 13. Addeth withall,
neither in chambering
and wantonnesse, noting
that these birds of a feather
will flye together,
for pascitur libido conuiuijs

nutritur delicijs, vino accenditur
ebrietate inflammatur.
He that could not be
tainted with vncleannesse
in Sodom, was ouertaken
with Incest and
drunckennesse in a Caue;
drunckennesse is the high
way to all bestiall affections
and actions; It is
therefore Saint Pauls exhortation,
Be not drunke
with Wine wherein is excesse,
Ephes. 5. for then a
man is drawne to excesse,
and led by the Diuell to
commit any villany euen
with greedinesse.
               The Diuell in this is
like your blacke-smith,

when his Iron is red-hot,
hee can then forge it vnto
what fashion himselfe
pleaseth; So when a man
is made hott with Wine,
the Diuell can worke him
then to any villany whatsoeuer:
Saint Paul yokes
this swine with the couetous
man, and excludes
both these beastes from
the Kingdome of God:
some collect as much
from the Greeke word,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   which is the name
of an intemperate man,
he is so called saith Phaeuorinus,
Quod non possit
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   because he cānot
be saued, 1. Cor. 6. 9. I leaue

this Brewers friend, and
come to the Powlters,
to Gluttons: As for them
the Apostle maketh them
plaine Idolaters, Phil: 3.
19. As the Babilonians vsed
daily to sacrifice to
their Idoll Bel: so doeth
the Glutton to his belly
making this his God, and
the graue wherein he burieth
all his substance, for
venter vitae Caribdis: As
Diogenes sometimes saide,
the gut is a gulfe wherein
many one drowneth all
his Patrimony, Solebant
Dijs construi templa, altaria
erigi, &c. In former times
men did vse to builde

Temples, erect Shrines,
maintaine Priests, to offer
Sacrifice, and burne
Incense to the Eternall
Deity saide the Heathen,
but the belly now hath
eaten vp all these, for
now many maintaine no
Priests but a Cooke, and
serue no other God but
their belley.
               Their chiefest care is to
prouide meate for their
bellies, and their bellies
for meate, as Brewers
ordaine drinke for their
barrels, and their barrels
for drinke: with Philoxenus
they wish that their
throats were as long as a

Cranes necke, that the
sweetnesse of their meats
and drinkes might the
longer abide. All their
Faith is in the Kitchen,
all their Hope in the Pantery,
all their Loue in the
Kettle; The Kitchen is
their Temple, the Cooke
their Priest, God their
Cater, and their belley
their God; Their exercise
is walking to gett
them a stomacke to their
meate, as others labour
to get them meate for
their stomacke: With the
Sodomites they feede
themselues against the
day of slaughter, which

cannot be farre off: If you
aske (sayth Seneca) why
we die suddenly, it is because
we liue by the death
of many creatures. And
how can they liue long,
Qui meris mortibus viuunt:
The Fowles are
more endaungered by
these two-legged then
by the foure-footed
Foxes, and themselues
may feare one day with
their fellow-glutton to
be most tormented in
their tongues, because
they haue offended most
in their tasts: Nothing is
more absurd then that Epicurean
resolution, Let

vs eate and drinke, to morrow
we shall die: As if wee
were made onely for the
panch, and liued that we
might liue. Wee should
say rather, let vs fast and
pray, to morrow we shall
die. A strong body makes
thy death more violent;
bestowe not then a costly
roofe vpon a ruynous tenemēt,
or a mudde-wall:
That mans departure wil
be happy & easie, whom
Death findeth with a
weake Body, and a strong
Soule.
            
            
               
               12 Of Goods ill gotten.
               NOthing is more hunted
after in this
world among many men
then wealth and riches,
as if store of Gold and
Siluer were the onely
Venison that could procure
a blessing; we make
our selues drudges and
slaues beneath all names
of basenesse, to get a little
white or redde earth,
which haue made many
prouder, none better for
enioying them: and yet
nothing is more vncertaine
then are riches:

                  Quem dies vidit veniens
superbum: hunc dies vidit
fugiens iacentem. Saint
Pauls aduise is not to trust
in vncertaine riches 1.Timoth. 6. Fugitiuus est
& ingratus seruus pecunia:
quamvis seruorum adhibita
sit custodia, saepius tamen
seruis persuadens cum ipsis
fugit Custodibus: Chrys.
Among other reasons,
why Riches are so vncertaine,
one is, because they
are ill gotten: There are
those who grow rich and
wealthy by the oppression
of the people. Iob
speakes of a man who
builds his house as the

moath, Chap: 27. As a
moath is made rich by
spoiling the garments,
bookes, and barkes in
which it liueth, so there
are those who grow rich
and wealthy by deuouring
the poore; thinking
with Vespasian, that gaine
is sweete howsoeuer gotten:
but wealth which is
gained by vniust meanes
(like Ionas his gourd)
soone withereth: the owners
thereof are like Esdras
his visions, for a time
goodly and glorious to
behold, but in a moment
vanished.
               
                  Hee hath deuoured substance,

and he shall vomit it
saith Zophar of the Oppressor:
Iob 20. 15. The meaning
is that ill gotten
goods lye vppon the conscience
as rawe meate vpon
a sick stomacke: which
a man is neuer well vntill
hee hath cast it vp againe
by restitution.
               As Lewis the leauenth
King of France did on his
death-bed restore two
Counties to the heyres
of Iohn, King of Arragon,
to which in his life time
hee would neuer before
condiscend.
               As the Partridge gathereth
the young which

shee hath not brought
forth, so he that getteth
riches vniustly & wrongfully,
shall leaue them in
the midst of his dayes,
and at his ende shall bee a
foole, 17. Ierem: 11. The
Partridge, (saith Ambrose)
maketh her a neast
of stolne egges which she
hath not layed, but as
soone as the birds are
hatched, the true mother
calls them all away from
their theeuish stepdame,
so it is with the couetous
and cruell man Incubat
auro: Like a Hen that sits
he may keepe his neast for
a while, and sit at home to

hatch more wealth by vniust & vnlawfull meanes:
But when his Chickens
are hatched, God the
true owner of them will
call them away, drawe
them out of his belly, and
none of his meate shall bee
left, Iob: 20. 15. 21. He shall
haue nothing to his posteritie
as some expound
it; for what is gotten vpon
the Diuels backe will
surely be spent vnder his
belly. Shee gathered it of
the hyre of an Harlot, and
they shall returne to the wages
of an Harlot: Mich: 1. 
                        •
                     .
What men get by Vsury,
Fraud, Sacriledge, or Extortion,

Vsury, Oppression,
or somewhat else
shall consume it; Talis
substantia non est stabilis,
aut ipsis inventibus est peritura,
aut a malis haeredibus
est dissipanda, Chrysost: in
Math: The Eagle stole a
piece of fleshe from the
Altar, but with the meat
she carried away a coale
that set her neast on fire:
who seeth not this verified
in those who get their
wealth by Sacriledge and
vniust means, themselues
& their heyres (like those
who robbed the Temple
of Tholossa) neuer prosper
afterward. Gaine so

gotten may seem a sweet
spoile: yet will it prooue
as pernicious as Achans
wedge; or as that lucklesse
belt to Turnus which bereaued
him of his life, that
otherwise should haue
beene spared. So Christ
when he would graciously
pardon, beholding the
stolne cognizance of his
Spouse, may take away
his mercy, or adde a vengeance
further, (Pallas te
hoc vulnere Pallas immolat)
One torture more for
this.
               The Arke when it was
in Dagons house, broke
Dagons necke, our Arke

hath so dealt with our
Dagons, who with lay
handes haue imprisoned
it, where there is Gloria
Patri, without a sicut in
principio, there cannot be
gloria filio nunc et in saecula:
Gnipho the Vsurer (as Lucian
faineth) lyeth in Hell
lamenting his miserable
estate, that one Rodochares
an incestuous Prodigall
did on earth cōsumne his
goods wastfully, which
hee with care and vniust
meanes had scrapt together.
There is a worthy
obseruation made vppon
the fortunes of the house
of Desmond in Irelaud,
                  
that as Maurcice Fitz-Thomas
the first Earle did
first raise the greatnes of
that house by Irish exactions
and oppressions: So
Girald the last Earle did
at last ruine and reduce it
to nothing by vsing the
like extortions: what oppression
and extortion
shall get and build vp; oppression,
or extortion, or
prodigality, will ruyne
and pull downe, which
may well be expressed by
the olde Emblem of a
Torch turned downewards
with this word.
Quod me alit extinguit.
               
               
                  
That which doeth nourish
and maintaine my flame,
Euen that ere long doth
quite put out the same.
            
            
               13 Of Whooredome.
               VVHoredome although
a Bastard,
yet mee thinkes it
doth naturally father it
selfe vpon Pride, while
the harlot trimmed vp
placeth her selfe in the
door to cal in customers,
and hauing impudently
kissed a man in the streets,
shee easily leadeth the
willing Oxe vnto the

slaughter. This sinne,
though not so generally,
is among many leawde
ones as openly professed
as some honest and lawfull
vocaton: by this craft
(as Demetrius by his siluer
Temples of Diana)
many get their goods:
some esteeme this sinne
but a tricke of youth, Detur
aliquid aetati, non est
crede mihi vitium, &c. As
that vnwise Tutor sometimes
spake: youth must
be borne withall, And to
followe harlots it is not,
trust me, a fault in young
men, but by these tumbling-tricks,
they often

breake their own neckes.
               God neuer saide vnto
Adam and Eue, increase
and multiply before they
were married, to shewe
that God hath a curse,
not a blessing; for that increase
which is not lawfull:
Turdus sibi malum.
The Adulterer doth busie

slaine by Telegonus his
base son begot on Circe.
               
               When Paris bestowed
the Ball on Venus, shee

Helena, who in the ende
proued his ruine and destruction;
for Whoremongers

and Adulterers,
God will iudge, Heb: 13. 4.
Into this sinne men are
often drawne by their
eyes; Of Putiphars Wife
it is saide, that she cast her
eye vpon Ioseph and saide
lye with me; Vritque videndo
foemina. Among other
markes of false Teachers,
Saint Peter sets downe
this one remarkable, hauing
eyes full of Adultery
that cannot cease to sinne,
2. Pet: 2. 14. From whence
some collect that the very
chayre of Adultery
is seated in the eye: but
indeede the eye is but
a Pipe to leade it to the

soule, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :
An nescis? oculi sunt in amore
Duces: Vpon this
ground was founded that
same wise and wholesome
Law of Zaleucus of Locris,
which commanded that
the eyes of Adulterers
should be pulled out, because
they steale away the
heart, and guide, or counsell
men to vncleannesse.
The beauty of the daughters
of men betrayed the
holy seed; they saw, and
lusted: their sinne began
at their eyes; they
looked, lusted, sinned,
dyed.
               As that Chalky brimstone

(spoken of by Pliny
lib. 2. Cap. 105.) draweth &
snatcheth fire vnto it selfe
though farre remoued
& distant from the same:
so the eyes draw the fire
of Lust to the Soule, in
a farre larger distance;
Vpon which consideration
Alexander (who
named the Persian maides
dolores oculorum) refused
to haue Darius wife (a
Lady of incomparable
beauty) brought before
him, fearing least he who
had lately subdued the
Husband, should himselfe
in the ende be conquered
at the sight of the

Wife. This it was that
moued Iob to make a couenant
with his eyes, not
to looke vpon a mayde,
for by them commonly,
Sathan creepes into the
Heart. This will one
day bee the lasciuious
mans complaint, I saw
and lusted.
               That Soule which desireth
to flye Fornication
must not suffer his eyes,
with Dinah, to goe and
see the maydes of the
Countrey, for the minde
of Man will conceiue
great and little spots by
the mediation of the eies,
as Labans sheepe did their

young, at the sight of the
pilled rodds, which Iacob
laid in the watring
troughes.
            
            
               14. Of Idlenesse.
               THat Prouerbe is as
olde in truth as it
is in time, Otia dant
vitia, Idlenesse bringeth
much euill. This is the
Mother of Adultery, If
you would knowe why
Aegisthus was an adulterer,
In promptu causa est,
desidiosus erat: When Dauid
speakes of sensuall
men, he saith, Non sunt

in laboribus, what was the
issue? This was the cause
They be so holden with pride
Psalm. 73. 6. Wee know
that Idlenesse was one of
the sinnes of Sodome, this
with others did help to
lay her in the dust: whilst
the Romanes had warres
with Carthage, and enemies
in Affricke, they
knewe not what vices
ment in Rome.
               
               The time when the enuious
man did sowe his
tares, was whilst men
slept. The Crab-fishe
(whenas the Oyster doth
open her selfe) casteth a
stone into her shell, and

so not being able to shut
her selfe againe, becomes
a prey vnto the Crab.
The Fathers apply this
vnto the Deuill, when
hee findeth men gaping
and idle, hee casteth into
them some stone of temptation,
whereby hee
works their ouerthrowe:
The slothfull man is the
Deuils shop; there hee
workes, euer busie when
men are lazie. A wise
and auncient Counsellor,
sometimes of this Kingdome,
saw asmuch when
he wittily rebuked the
manners and customes
of a strange Countrey

not much differing from
his own, but in the little,
for that they first made
thieues and taught them
to steale, and after hanged
them vp: They made
thieues saith hee, in that
they suffered such a multitude
of Seruingmen to
be trained vp in ydlenes
and pride, who afterwards
being thrust out of
seruice must needes bee
driuen vnto thieuery, for
then (like their fellowe
in the Gospell) to digge
they cannot, and to begg
they are ashamed; many
ruo into this vice out of
wealth and abundance,

these with the Nightingale
hauing feathered
their neasts sing no more:
as vnprofitable are they
vnto the world as Margites,
of whom it is said, that
he neuer plowed, nor digged,
nor did any thing all
his life-long that might
tend vnto any goodnes.
Their care is to seeke out
merry company, and ydle
pastimes to spend away
time: If otherwise then
(with Domitian) they fall
to catch flyes; hauing
wearied themselues in
this spider busines, they
get them out towards the
euening vnto the fieldes,

not to pray (like Isaack)
but to prouide them a
stomacke, which as they
get vppon other mens
grounds: So they study
where they may allay
it at other mens tables,
and there they lay about
them like the Priests
of Bell, of whom it is said,
they did eate and drinke
vp all; For howsoeuer
they are lesse then women
at their worke, yet
at their meate they are
more then men. Other
ydle bodies there are
who blame neede, when
but for sloth they might
worke and haue enough.

These Caterpillers deuoure
the sweete which
others haue swett for. If
God would deale with
these iustly, and men
strictly obserue the Apostles
rule, That he which
would not worke, should not
eate. 2. Thes: 3. 10. I thinke
as many would die of Idlenesse,
as of sicknesse.
Pitty it is that like Droan
bees they should eate of
the honny, or liue in the
hyue, much lesse swarme
and muster like the flies
and frogges in Pharaohs
Kingdome.
               For these men God
hath no blessing, it was

not said, call the loyterers
or ydle bodies, but Call
the labourers and giue them
their hire: Mat: 20. 8. And
none but labourers had
the penny; euery man
must haue either a sweating
browe, or a working
braine. It was not Adams
case alone, but it is the
case of euery one in his
calling, In sudore vultus.
tui; those who were found
ydle were rebuked with a
Quid statis? God who
hath made nothing to be
ydle, can endure no ciphers
in his Arethmetick,
no slothfull persons in his
Vineyard: Adam was

put into the Garden to
till and dresse it; no sooner
created but by and by
he is set to labour,: Paradise
which was the store-house,
was also his work-house,
it serued not onely
to feed his senses, but
to exercise his hands; All
his delight could not
make him happy in an
idle life, therefore no
sooner made but by and
by he is set to worke. Hee
must labour, because hee
was happy; much more
must wee, that hereafter
we may be. As for idle
bodies, whenas like drunken
seruingmen, they

haue spent the allowance
of their lights in ryot,
they shall at last goe to
bed darkeling, And then
shall they weepe and
howle, because they did
not those things in time
which belonged to their
peace.
            
            
               15. Of Cosenage.
               THis Sinne, (like the
Sunshine day, which
deluded Esops Dogge)
beguileth men of that
they haue, with a vaine
hope of that they neuer
shall haue. And although

euery day some buy repē
                  tance
too deare, yet one
young Master, or other,
is perswaded to pay aforehand
for the Pigge in
the poake: for when the
simple goe to Market, thē
the Crafty get mony: and
had I wist, comming alwaies
at the last, commeth
euer to late, as Esau
was sorry when hee had
sold his Birth-right.
               Great is the number
of these subtle Foxes,
who like the Deuill are
alwaies compassing the
earth, and dayly goe
vp and downe seeking
whō they may deuoure.

These are sonnes of those
Locusts, which haue faces
like the faces of men,
but killing stings in their
tailes: like Gnatts, after
they haue made a sweet
kinde of Musicke with
their entising wordes,
they euermore sting before
they depart. Not
vnlike the Herbe Sardonia
of which Solinus reports,
that it maketh the
eaters thereof to looke
as if they laughed, but in
laughing dye. Though
many bee skilfull in this
guilefull practise, yet Achans
wedge of Gold, &
Babylonish garment, in

the end shall worke his
confusion; These Men
with Perillus perish in
their owne inuentions,
their cunning at the last
fayleth and leaueth them
as Absoloms Mule left
his rebellious Master
betweene Heauen and
Earth.
            
            
               16. Of Swearing and
Forswearing.
               THere are many liuing
that cannot tell how
to begin to Pray, and
know not when to make
an end of Swearing, oaths

striue for number with
words, and no wonder,
Impunitas transgressionum
nutrix est; He is seldome
corrected who blasphemeth
the dreadfull God:
Some are of opinion that
the sinne of that Israelite
who was stoned for Blasphemy,
was only this, that
he durst name that ineffable
name Iehouah: there
feare could keepe them
from mentioning the
dreadfull name of God,
our feare cannot bridle
vs from abusing it; a sinne
detested euen by the very
Heathens. Among the
Egiptians the common

Swearer was to be beheaded:
The Grecians punished
it with losse of
Eares: But our righteousnes
should exceed the
righteousnes of the
Scribes and Pharisies, that
so we may escape the
iudgement denounced
by the Prophet Ieremy,
The Land is full of Adulteries,
and because of Swearing
the Land mourneth. 23.
10. The Light (not being
a bare brightnes but a
cleere discerner of things
vnseene) doth well expresse
and declare the nature
and vse of an oath,
which the Grecians call

                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   for truth
lyeth hidden; And the
Latines note no lesse, in
calling it, Iusiurandum, because
a trueth and nothing
but a trueth is to be
sworne; as in calling it
Sacramentum they imply
the conscyence we
should make of it; a matter
quite forgotten by
our Knights of the Post;
who (like Putiphars
Wife) doe only shew the
Garments of an honest
Man to prooue their
dishonest cause, being of
Lysanders minde, who
was wont to say Pueri
talis, viri Sacramentis,
                  
Children must be deceyued
by Dice & Blanckes,
Men by oathes.
               Auncient Pleas passing
by record, and latter controuersies
Viua Voce, both
seeme to say, that Men of
lesse wealth and more honesty
are most worth.
The rest haue sprung
vp as Nettles & Thornes
when God cursed the
Earth. These Priscilianists
are of great antiquitie,
though neuer growne
so shameles as now. Moses
prouided Legem talionis
for them who would
beare false witnes. The
Iudges (saith he) shall

make diligent inquisition,
and if the Witnesse be
found false, and hath giuen
false witnes against his Brother,
then shall yee doe vnto
him as he had thought to
haue don to his Brother;
Life for life, Eye for Eye,
Tooth for Tooth. Deut. 19.
18. As that decree argueth
that in his time such
vngodlines was feared;
So the plot of Iesabel
(who, writing to the Iudges
commaunded them
to set vp two wicked
Men, Sons of Belial or
Vnthrifts as some translation
hath it suborned
Witnesses against the life

of innocent Naboth)
plainely sheweth, that
this abuse was both
knowne and practised by
those who should rather
haue sought out and punished
such Sons of Belial
then haue made vse of
their falshood. Iuuenal
the Poet in his time derided
these lewd and loose
companions, for betaking
themselues to such professed
villanie, and wished
them rather to be Brokers
of old Stuffe, Hoc satius
quam si dicas sub Iudice,
vidi, quod non vidisti:
Any base Trade were far
better then to affirme before

a Iudge, I saw that which
thou neuer sawest: Faciant
equites Asiani: Let the
Asian Knights, renowned
for Periury and false euidence,
liue by that professed
villany; He thought
it a disgrace for Romans,
and wee may thinke such
damned practises vnworthy
to be named amongst
Christians, except it be
with reproofe and hatred:
For the Lord himselfe
(who is a swift Witnes
against false Swearers)
will shoote at those
with a swift Arrow: And
as when the Elders left

                  Susannaes cause in wrong
sentence; Daniel tooke it
in hand to right it with
the ruine of those who
did beare false witnesse against
her: So when these
wicked Men by their periury
and falsehood, haue
peruerted the seate of
Iudgement and course of
Iustice: God him selfe
will take it in hand to decide
it with the confusion
of those, who mock at
Iudgement and swallow Iniquitie.
Pro. 19. 28. For
although with great patience
God beareth with
this intollerable Sinne
for a long season, yet

                  Tarditatem supplicij grauitate
Iudicij recompensat, Gr:
They shal not be vnpunished
for euer; Truely in
this thing speaketh the
Poet Tibullus.
               
               Ah! miser et si quis primo
periuria caelat,
               Sera tamen tacitis poena
venit pedibus.
               Ah: wretched man though periuries,
at first full secret be:
               Though slowly, yet due penalties,
will come assuredly.
               This as it seemeth was
fulfilled in Phillip King
of Macedon his posterity,
whom Pausanias recordeth
to haue fallen into

many miseries and very
great calamities, because
hee made no conscience
to violate and falsifie
his oathes: Eusebius
in his 6. Booke 8. Cap: reports
how three lewd varlets
accused Narcissus a holy
and reuerend Bishop
of a haynous crime, and
confirmed their accusations
with oathes; the first
swore, If I lie let mee bee
burned to ashes. The second,
If I report not the
truth, let me be consumed
with some cruell disease:
The third, If I beare false
witnesse, let me be smitten
with blindnesse.
               
                  
In processe of time,
God punished their periuries
by wrapping them
in the same curses which
they had wished to themselues;
The first, had his
house fired in the night,
wherewith he and all his
family were burnt: The
second had the Iaundice
whereof he died most vncomfortably:
The third
seeing the miserable end
of the other two (though
he repented and confessed
the conspiracy,) yet
hee lost his sight and became
blinde with weeping.
God in Iustice oftentimes
taks men at their

word, and effects that
which their lippes speake
against their hearts. There
is no better remedie against
false swearing, then
not to sweare at all; not to
accustome our selues to
swearing; admonitio non
iurandi conseruatio est a peccato
periurij. August: The
admonition in Scripture
not to sweare: is a preseruation
from false and
wrongfull swearing. As
for those who make no
conscience of an oath, but
will sweare and forsweare
for the wages of vnrighteousnes,
I wish them no
other punishment then

that which Phillip of Macedon
inflicted vpon two
of his Subiects in whom
he saw no hope of Grace,
Vnum a Macedonia fugere,
alterum persequi iussit,
He made the one of them
to runne out of Macedonia,
and the other to driue
him, a faire riddance of
them both▪ (as it is in the
prouerbe) without a Sessions.
            
            
               17. Of bad company.
               HOwsoeuer Fishes liuing
in salt waters
doe retaine a fresh tast,

and neuer sauour of the
brinish qualitie of the
Sea wherein they are
bred and doe liue. And it
may bee true which Solinus
reports of the Riuer
Tigris in Armenia,
that passeth many miles
through the lake of Arethusa,
yet it neither mingleth
waters nor fishes
with the lake, but is quite
of another colour from
the same, yet inficitur terrae
sordibus vnda fluens,
As siluer streames hauing
any vicinity with putrified
and infected soiles, are
tainted with their corrupt
qualities, and varie

their sauours with the
vaines of the soile throgh
which they passe, so it
fareth in the manners of
men for the most part, if
they among whom wee
liue be infected with any
sinne, we doe often sauor
of their corruptions.
               
                  Rerum natura sic est, vt
quoties bonus malo coniungitur,
non ex bono malus
melioretur, sed ex malo
bonus contaminetur: Chrys:
Such is the nature of
things, that when a good
man is ioyned with a bad,
the euill is not bettered
by the good, but the good
corrupted by the euill.

The Lacedemonians very
wisely inquiring after
the behauiour of their
children, demaunded
with what playfellowes
they were lincked, not
doubting but they would
bee like vnto such, whose
fellowship they fancied.
Amicitiae vt pares quaerunt
ita et faciunt, Friendship
as it seeketh, so it
maketh men alike in conditions.
               Euen Ioseph by liuing
in Pharaohs Court did
learne to sweare by Pharaohs
life: Peter being among
the high Priests
seruants did deny his Master,

                  Quanto calescebatigne
sacerdotali, tanto frigescebat
amore diuino, The warmer
hee was by the high
Priests fire, the colder he
was in loue to his Master:
Commisti sunt inter gentes,
said Dauid of the people
of God; what was the issue?
and they learned their
workes. If we be companions
to Ostridges wee shall
sauour of their wildnesse,
as they who sleepe with
dogges, shal swarme with
fleas.
               One Corah did but kindle
the fire of conspiracy,
and presently two hundreth
and fiftie Captaines

brought sticks to increase
it. A leawd man is a most
pernicious creature, hee
commonly drawes vengeance
vpon others, either
by the desert of his
sinne, or by the infection
of it. So venemous is
wickednesse (especially,
when it lights amongst
Gods people) that one
dram of it is able to corrupt
the whole lumpe of
Israel. Saint Paul therefore
giueth this wholesome admonition, Be not
Companions with them. Ephes:
5. 7. For if wee liue
with the froward, we shal
loue frowardnesse. The

sonnes of God by marriing
with the daughters of
men, were drawne from
their former purity; these
marriages did not beget
men so much as wickednesse:
Vitia ad vicinos serpunt
et contactu nocent: Seneca.
Sinne among men,
like the rot among sheepe
is of a catching and infectious
quality: many
haue fallen into a fashion
of swearing, drinking,
and theeuing, out of the
euill practise of others:
it is a hard matter for that
soule not to fall into those
vices vnto which the eies
and the eares are invred.

Swallowes would not
come within Thebes, because
the walles were so
often besieged, let not
men, put on wings to flie
into the company of those
men whose manners are
corrupted, for feare of destruction:
Be not partakers
in her sinnes that yee receiue

18. 4. The reason why our
Sauiour would not giue
that Disciple leaue to goe
bury his dead father, was
(say some Diuines) least his
vnbelieuing kindred (who
would bee present at his
fathers Funerall) should
corrupt him againe, and

so hee should die with
them: bad men keepe others
from goodnesse as
those dead carkasses did
the Rauen from Noahs
Arke: Runne wee then
from these as Moses did
from his rod turned to a
Serpent; for if we ioyne
our selues to Baal Peor:
Like the Israelites, wee
will eate the offerings of
the dead, and bow down
to their Gods. Num: 25.

               18. Of Enuy.
               ENuy in some sort is
like the eye that seeth

other things, but not it
selfe; it is the canker of
good mindes, reaching
vp to the Crowne on the
Kings head: For Athalia
crying Treason, Treason,
when Ioash was crowned
lawfull King pointeth
at all such as say; that is
vnfit for others, themselues
would haue: it is as
true of enuy as it is of loue
that it will creepe where
it dares not goe: Haman
hath all fauour of the
King, yet being at oddes
with Mordecaie maketh
the Queene her selfe a
marke to shoote at, it is
like a flye sucking sores to

make them sorer: Felicity
and vertue (which are the
life of good men) are
death to the euuious: parū
est si ipse sit faelix nisi alter
fuerit infaelix: 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
are ioyned together by
the Apostle, because Inuidia

                        •
                     ons Cladium, enuy is
the fountaine of murther:
when I behold Enuy (as
the Poet describeth her)
to haue a pale face without
blood, a leane body
without moysture (like
one of Pharaohs leane
Kine) squint eyes, foule
or blacke teeth, a heart ful
of gall, a tongue tipt with
poison, neuer laughing

but when others weepe;
neuer sleeping because
she alwaies thinketh on
mischiefe; I then abhorre
this Monster: But when
I consider the delicate
food whereon the enuious
man feedeth, I then
abhorre and hate him:
for the enuious man is fed
with the daintiest food
that may be: hee feedeth
on his owne heart: for
there was neuer Enuy
that was not bloody, if it
eate not anothers heart it
will eate it owne. Socrates
called enuy an impostume
of the soule: Salomon,
Prouerb: 14. Tearmeth it

the rotting of the bones;
it shorteneth the life saith
Ecclesiasticus, 39. 24. Amongst
other euils God
hath furnished Enuie
with one onely profitable
and iust quality. Authori
incommoda, saith Basil,
the owner thereof is
most plagued with it: As
Aetna consumed it selfe,
so the enuious man is
burnt and consumed with
the fire of his owne heart,
Carpitque et carpitur vna,
Hee biteth and is bitten againe,
and becomes his
owne hangman. I leaue
this moath labouring to
extinguish the light of other

mens goodnesse I
know in the ende hee will
sindge his owne wings.
            
            
               19. Of Flatterers.
               FLatterers like the reflection
of a looking
glasse, doe imitate any action
that you vse: their
ende is to catch Dotterels.
These liue of gentle
mindes, honourable personages,
and worshipfull
gentlemen, like Apes and
Parrats, by shewing feats
of actiuity, piping, wanton
disoursing, and magnifying
all that is done.

                  Antisthenes said truly of
them, Praestat 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  quam

                  incidere:
for Rauens feede onely
vpon dead carkasses, but
Flatterers vpon liuing
men. Of all wild beasts
the Tyrant is the worst;
of all tame beasts, the
Flatterer, said Diogines.
For a mans greatest enemies,
are his greatest praisers:
The tongue of a
flatterer, saith Augustine,
wounds worse then the
hand of a murtherer.
               The one killeth but the
body, the other both body
and soule, whereas it is
the speech of the Spouse
in the Cant: 2. Take vs the

Foxes which destrooy the
Vines. Ber: Vpon those
words saith, Duo sunt vulpium
genera, There are
two kindes of Foxes, the
Slanderer, and the Flatterer;
these destroy the
Vines, & bring destruction
to the sonnes of men,
the Flatterer tickleth his
friends to death, stealing
goodnesse from them by
his intising speeches, as
Absolon stole the hearts
of the people by flattering
words. This man is a friēd
for his owne occasion.
Like the Polipus hee turneth
himselfe into any
colour for aduantage.
               
                  
For a crust this Spaniell
will fawne vpon any man:
but if a storme of affliction
beginnes to beat vpon
thee, this sommer-bird
sings no more: hee hath
the persons of men in admiration
because of aduantage:
The Asse which
carried the Egyptian Goddesse,
had many bared
heads, and bended knees;
yet none to the beast, but
all to the burthen; if there
be no honny in the gallypott,
these waspes will no
longer houer about it, but
flye and runne from it as
Myce from an empty
barne, or Lice from a dead

body which hath neither
heate nor moisture: they
deceiue others and maintaine
themselues (like Tobacco-sellers)
with a litle
smoake; it were no great
iniustice with smoake to
choake them: So Alexander
Seuerus (a great enemy
to flatterers) serued
one Turinus, who had
craftily gottē many great
bribes and guifts in making
the people beleeue
that hee was of great authority
with the Emperour,
and could helpe
them to whatsoeuer they
sued for, whereof the Emperour
being certified,

caused him in the open
Market to bee fastened to
a stake and there killed
him with smoake. The
Cryer thus crying to the
people, Fumo pereat qui fumum
vendidit, Smoake he
sold, and with smoake
hee is choaked.
               FINIS.
