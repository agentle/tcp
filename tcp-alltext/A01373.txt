            EChe man deſiers to haue reporte,
            of newes both ſtrange and rare:
            And couits for to know thoſe thinges,
            whereby they may be ware.
            For to avoyde thoſe doynges greate,
            that might on them befall:
            For by example are they taught to do,
            and what they ſhall
            Receiue for their malicious mindes,
            and wicked Treaſons greate:
            As now of late it hath been ſeen
            through Iuſtice iudgements ſeate.
            That holdes the ſworde to do the right,
            and ſtrike where blowes ſhould fall:
            And puniſh for their wicked liues,
            eche one whom ſhe doth call.
            The poore, the ritche, the learnd, ye wiſe
            the begger and the ſnudge:
            The Kynge ſomtime too hath it felt,
            aſwell as hath the drudge.
            Wherefore be lawes decreed and made
            but for to puniſh thoſe,
            That will not by theyr Prince be rewld
            but ſeemes to be theyr foes.
            As now is ſeene by Felton lo,
            that lately here did die,
            In Paules Churchyarde he left his life,
            on Galows taule and hie.
            Who from the priſon where he lay,
            was drawne on Hardell there:
            For good example of all ſuch,
            that they might take the feare.
            For to beware of ſuche like facte,
            as well in worde as deede:
            Leaſt they for theyr like hier at laſt
            no better like to ſpeede.
            * Now marke his ende and what I ſhall
            reporte here of his death:
            For why theſe eares of mine did here,
            and iyes while that his breath
            Remained in his wicked corps,
            which ſtubbornly did die:
            As one me thought ſomthing beſt raught
            through Treaſons crueltie.
            His Gowne of Grograin he put of,
            which on his backe he had:
            And eke his Doublet which was made
            of Sattin ſomwhat ſad.
            Into his Shirte he then was ſtript,
            and vp the Ladder he
            Did mount, for to receaue that death,
            that eche man there might ſe.
            Theſe wordes he ſpake, and ſaid alowde
            my Maiſters all and ſome:
            One thinge I haue to ſay to you,
            now that I here am come.
            That is, I pray you all with me
            beare recorde what I ſay:
            I here proteſt before you all
            , this preſent dieyng day,
            That I was neuer Traytour ſure,
            nor Treaſon to my Queene
            Did neuer do, nor neuer thought,
            that euer hath been ſeene.
            And for the facte wherefore I die,
            I can it not denie:
            But at the Gate where as the Bull
            was hanged, there was I,
            In company, on more with me,
            did hange it vp together:
            And though in place, I had not bin,
            it had not ſcaped euer.
            From hanging vp, for ſuredly,
            for that ſame preſent day:
            It had bin hanged, in that place,
            though I had been away.
            Then ſayde the Shreue, vnto him,
            Oh Felton do remember:
            That thou haſt bin, a Traytour great
            and to the Queene offender.
            And ſurely thou moſte Trayterouſly,
            and ſtubbornly haſt thou ſought,
            The beſt thou couldſt to go aboute,
            thy Prince to bringe to nought.
            And eke the Realme and all the reſt,
            as mutche as in thee lay,
            Thou ſoughſt by thy Traiterous harte,
            to bringe vnto decay.
            Therfore call vnto God the Lord,
            and pray him from thy hart:
            That he receaue thy ſoule to reſt,
            when thou from hence ſhalt part.
            Well ſo I do, and here I craue,
            you all good people pray
            For me, that ready is to dye,
            and then began to ſay,
            Into thy hands, Oh Lord my God,
            I yeeld my Soule and Breath:
            For thou haſt me redeemd, I ſay,
            with thy moſt precious death.
            
               In manus tuas Domine,
            
            and ſo the reſt he ſayde,
            The Hangman then did throwe him of,
            and ſo his breath was ſtaide.
            He hanged theare vpon the Tree,
            and in a litle ſpace:
            They cut him downe incontinent,
            that Iuſtice might take place.
            Wher as he quartred ſhoulde be,
            according to the Lawe:
            And to the Iudgement that he had,
            to make thoſe ſtande in awe.
            That be of his affinitie:
            and ſurely there be ſome,
            That thinkes that he deſerude not death
            in all that he hath don.
            He then diſmembred was ſtraight way,
            when he had ended that:
            His Belly ripped open wide,
            his Bowels all he gat.
            And to the fire he ſtraight them threwe,
            which ready there was made:
            And there conſumed all to duſt,
            as is the fiers trade.
            His Head cut of, the Hangman then,
            did take it vp in hand:
            And vp alofte he did it ſhowe,
            to all that there did ſtand.
            And then his body in Fowre partes,
            was quartred in that place:
            More pitty that his Traytorous Hart,
            could take no better grace.
            And thus he had his iuſt deſarte,
            as well he had deſerued:
            I would the reſt that not repents,
            were likewiſe alſo ſerued.
            Beware you Papiſts all beware,
            be true vnto your Queene:
            Let not your Traiterous hartes be bent
            as here tofore hath been.
            Stand not againſt the liuing God,
            ſpurne not againſt his Law:
            Kicke not againſt the Pricke I ſay,
            but haue him ſtill in awe.
            Be not aſhamde to torne in time,
            ſet ſhamefaſtneſſe aſide:
            No ſhame it is to turne to God,
            though you haue gon far wide,
            The farther you haue gon aſtray,
            and wicked wayes hath led,
            The erneſter you ſhould returne,
            from that moſt wicked Bed,
            Wherin you lay a ſleape long while,
            forgetting of his grace:
            Now call the refore vnto the Lord,
            to ſet you in that place,
            Where you may haue eternall reſt,
            and liue in heauen hie:
            And reſt in Abrahams boſome too,
            when that you needes muſt dye.
            And for that grace that God may geue,
            as I haue ſayde before:
            I humbly pray continually,
            both now and euermore.
            Our Prince, our Queene Elizabeth,
            a happy ſtate to haue:
            Let vs all pray with one accord,
            her noble grace to ſaue.
            And hir to keepe from all hir foes,
            and ſheild eternally:
            From wicked wights that go about,
            to ſéeke continually:
            Hir whole decay: the Lord defend,
            hir noble royall hart:
            From yeelding to thoſe Foes of hirs,
            that daily plaies their parte.
            For to be reeue her of her right,
            and of hir ſtately Crowne:
            All thoſe (I ſay) that ſo doth ſeke,
            God ſhortly throw them downe.
            Thus here I end, and once againe,
            the liuing God I pray:
            Our noble Quéene Elizabeth,
            preſerue both night and day.
            
               (ꝙ) F. G.
