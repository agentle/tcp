                     TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VERTVOVS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY, good Lord, Henry Lord Winſor, Baron of Bradenham.
                  
                     MY Lord, in the Coledge at Wincheſter, where I liue, I haue heard learned men ſay, that ſome Philoſophers haue miſtaken the ſoule of man for an Harmonie: Let the preſident of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I ſee not, if ſoules doe not partly conſiſt of Muſicke, how it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo noble a ſpirit as yours, ſo perfectly tuned to ſo perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, ſhould diſcend to the notice of a qualitie lying ſingle in ſo low a perſonage as my ſelfe. But in Muſicke the Baſe part is no diſgrace to the beſt eares attendauncie. I confeſſe my conſience is vntoucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confeſsion is vnſuſpected, many of vs Muſitians thinke it as much praiſe to be ſome what more then Muſitians, as it is for golde to bee ſome what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet ſome of vs might liue: vnleſſe we ſhould think, as the Artiſans in the Vniuerſities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordſhip will pardon this preſumption of mine, the rather, becauſe I know before Nobilitie I am to deale ſincearely; and this ſmall facultie of mine, becauſe it is alone in mee, and without the aſiſtance of other more confident ſciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the rather to bee receiued into your honors protection, ſo ſhall I obſerue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whoſe knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earneſtly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
                  
                     Your honors in all humble ſeruice Thomas Weelkes.

                     TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VERTVOVS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY good Lord, Henry Lord Winſor, Baron of Bradenham.
                  
                     MY Lord, in the Coledge at Wincheſter, where I liue, I haue heard learned men ſay, that ſome Philoſophers haue miſtaken the ſoule of man for an Harmonie: Let the preſident of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I ſee not, if ſoules doe not partly conſiſt of Muſicke, how it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo noble a ſpirit as yours, ſo perfectly tuned to ſo perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, ſhould diſcend to the notice of a qualitie lying ſingle in ſo low a perſonage as my ſelfe. But in Muſicke the Baſe part is no diſgrace to the beſt eares attendauncie. I confeſſe my conſience is vntoucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confeſsion is vnſuſpected, many of vs Muſitians thinke it as much praiſe to be ſome what more then Muſitians, as it is for golde to bee ſome what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet ſome of vs might liue: vnleſſe we ſhould think, as the Artiſans in the Vniuerſities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordſhip will pardon this preſumption of mine, the rather, becauſe I know before Nobilitie I am to deale ſincearely; and this ſmall facultie of mine, becauſe it is alone in mee, and without the aſiſtance of other more confident ſciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the rather to bee receiued into your honors protection, ſo ſhall I obſerue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whoſe knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earneſtly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
                  
                     Your honors in all humble ſeruice Thomas Weelkes.

                     TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VERTVOVS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY good Lord, Henry Lord Winſor, Baron of Bradenham.
                  
                     MY Lord, in the Coledge at Wincheſter, where I liue, I haue heard learned men ſay, that ſome Philoſophers haue miſtaken the ſoule of man for an Harmonie: Let the preſident of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I ſee not, if ſoules doe not partly conſiſt of Muſicke, how it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo noble a ſpirit as yours, ſo perfectly taned to ſo perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, ſhould diſcend to the notice of a qualitie lying ſingle in ſo low a perſonage as my ſelfe. But in Muſicke the Baſe part is no diſgrace to the beſt eares attendauncie. I confeſſe my conſience is vntoucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confeſsion is vnſuſpected, many of vs Muſitians thinke it as much praiſe to be ſome what more then Muſitians, as it is for golde to bee ſome what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet ſome of vs might liue: vnleſſe we ſhould think, as the Artiſans in the Vniuerſities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordſhi will pardon this preſumption of mine, the rather, becauſe I know before Nobilitie I am to deale ſincearely; and this ſmall facultie of mine, becauſe it is alone in mee, and without the aſiſtance of other more confident ſciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the rather to bee receiued into your honors protection, ſo ſhall I obſerue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whoſe knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earneſtly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
                  
                     Your honors in all humble ſeruice Thomas Weelkes.

                     TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VERTVOVS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY good Lord, Henry Lord Winſor, Baron of Bradenham.
                  
                     MY Lord in the Coledge at Wincheſter', where I liue, I haue heard learned men ſay, that ſome Philoſophers haue miſtaken the ſoule of man for an Harmonie: Let the preſident of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I ſee not, if ſoules doe not partly conſiſt of Muſicke, how it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo noble a ſpirit as yours, ſo perfectly tuned to ſo perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, ſhould diſcend to the notice of a qualitie lying ſingle in ſo low a perſonage as my ſelfe. But in Muſicke the Baſe part is no diſgrace to the beſt eares attendancie. I confeſſe my conſience is vntoucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confeſsion is vnſuſpected, many of vs Muſitians thinke it as much praiſe to be ſome what more then Muſitians, as it is for golde to bee ſome what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet ſome of vs might liue: vnleſſe we ſhould think, as the Artiſans in the Vniuerſities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordſhip will pardon this preſumption of mine, the rather, becauſe I know before Nobilitie I am to deale ſincearely; and this ſmall facultie of mine, becauſe it is alone in mee, and without the aſiſtance of other more confident ſciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the rather to bee receiued into your honors protection, ſo ſhall I obſerue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whoſe knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earneſtly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
                  
                     Your honors in all humble ſeruice Thomas Weelkes.

                     TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VERTVOVS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY good Lord, Henry Lord Winſor, Baron of Bradenham.
                  
                     MY Lord, in the Coledge at Wincheſter, where I liue, I haue heard learned men ſay, that ſome Philoſophers haue miſtaken the ſoule of man for an Harmonie: Let the preſident of their error be a priuiledge for mine. I ſee not, if ſoules doe not partly conſiſt of Muſicke, how it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo noble a ſpirit as yours, ſo perfectly tuned to ſo perpetuall a Tenor of excellencies as it is, ſhould diſcend to the notice of a qualitie lying ſingle in ſo low a perſonage as my ſelfe. But in Muſicke the Baſe part is no diſgrace to the beſt eares attendauncie. I confeſſe my conſience is vntoucht with any other arts, and I hope, my confeſsion is vnſuſpected, many of vs Muſitians thinke it as much praiſe to be ſome what more then Muſitians, as it is for golde to bee ſome what more than golde, and, if lack Cade were aliue, yet ſome of vs might liue: vnleſſe we ſhould think, as the Artiſans in the Vniuerſities in Poland, and Germany thinke, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordſhip will pardon this preſumption of mine, the rather, becauſe I know before Nobilitie I am to deale ſincearely; and this ſmall facultie of mine, becauſe it is alone in mee, and without the aſiſtance of other more confident ſciences, is the more to bee fauored, and the rather to bee receiued into your honors protection, ſo ſhall I obſerue you with as humble and as true an heart, as hee, whoſe knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earneſtly pray for you, to the worlds Creator.
                  
                     Your honors in all humble ſeruice Thomas Weelkes.

But vnder the fauour of your grauer wiſedome, I humbly beſeech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your delight in this kind, hath ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed my well pleaſed eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore ſelfe) enboldned my ſpirits, to make your onely ſelfe, the true iudge, and patron of theſe my vndeſeruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein, your gracious acceptance, and in their litle worth to nouriſh them, as beegotten for, and to your onely honorable ſelfe. Wherin, my heereafter times ſhall euer bind me to acknowledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulneſſe, & in my beſt wits, deſerue it as I may. Euer reſting, as beſt ſhall become mee.

But vnder the fauour of your grauer wiſedome, I humbly beſeech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your delight in this kind, hath ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed my well pleaſed eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore ſelfe) enboldned my ſpirits, to make your onely ſelfe, the true iudge, and patron of theſe my vndeſeruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein, your gracious acceptance, and in their litle worth to nouriſh them, as beegotten for, and to your onely honorable ſelfe. Wherin, my heereafter times ſhall euer bind me to acknowledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulneſſe, & in my beſt wits, deſerue it as I may. Euer reſting, as beſt ſhall become mee.

But vnder the fauour of your grauer wiſedome, I humbly beſeech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your delight in this kind, hath ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed my well pleaſed eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore ſelfe) enboldned my ſpirits, to make your onely ſelfe, the true iudge, and patron of theſe my vndeſeruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein. your gracious acceptance, and in their litle worth to nouriſh them, as beegotten for, and to your onely honorable ſelfe. Wherin, my heereafter times ſhall euer bind me to acknowledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulneſſe, & in my beſt wits, deſerue it as I may.

But vnder the fauour of your grauer wiſedome, I humbly beſeech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your delight in this kind, hath ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed my well pleaſed eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore ſelfe) enboldned my ſpirits, to make your onely ſelfe, the true iudge, and patron of theſe my vndeſeruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein, your gracious acceptance, and in their litle worth to nouriſh them, as beegotten for, and to your onely honorable ſelfe. Wherin, my heereafter times ſhall euer bind me to acknowledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulneſſe, & in my beſt wits, deſerue it as I may. Euer reſting, as beſt ſhall become mee.

But vnder the fauour of your grauer wiſedome, I humbly beſeech both your vertuous patience, and pardon heerein: for a generall worlds report both of honour and your delight in this kind, hath ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed my well pleaſed eares, as hath (forgetfully of my poore ſelfe) enboldned my ſpirits, to make your onely ſelfe, the true iudge, and patron of theſe my vndeſeruing papers. Humbly crauing heerein, your gracious acceptance, and in their litle worth to nouriſh them, as beegotten for, and to your onely honorable ſelfe. Wherin, my heereafter times ſhall euer bind me to acknowledge it in all due & reuerent thankefulneſſe, & in my beſt wits, deſerue it as I may.
