               IN Summer time when ſolkes make Hay,
               All is not true which people ſay,
               The foole's the wiſeſt in the play,
               tuſh take away your band:
               The Fidlers boy hath broke his Baſe,
               Sirs is not this a pittious caſe,
               Moſt gallants loath to ſmell the Mace
               of Woodſtréet.
            
            
               The Citty followes Courtly pride,
               
                  Ione ſweares ſhe cannot Iohn abide,
               
                  Dicke weares a Dagger by his ſide.
               come tell vs what's to pay.
               The Lawyers thriue by others fall,
               The weakeſt alwaies goes to'th wall,
               The Shoomaker commandeth all
               at's pleaſure.
            
            
               The Weauer prayes for Huſwiues ſtore,
               A pretty woman was Iane Shore.
               
               Kicke the baſe Raſcalls out o'th doore:
               peace, peace, you bawling Curres.
               A Cuckolds band weares out behinde,
               Tis eaſie to beguile the blinde,
               All people are not of one minde,
               hold Carmen.
            
            
               Our women cut their haire like men,
               The Cocke's ore-maſtred by the Henne
               There's hardly one goodfriend in ten,
               turne there on your right hand:
               But few regard the cryes o'th poore,
               
                  Will ſpendeth all vpon a whore,
               The Souldier longeth to goe ore,
               braue knocking.
            
            
               When the fifth Henry ſaild to France,
               Let me alone for a Countrey dance,

                  e on falſe hearted men:
               
                  Dicke Tarleton was a merry wagge,
               Harke how that prating aſſe doth bragge,
               
                  Iohn Dory ſold his ambling Nagge,
               for Kicke-ſhawes.
            
            
               The Saylor counts the Ship his houſe,
               Ile ſay no more but dun's the Mouſe,
               He is no man that ſcornes a Louſe,
               vaine pride vndoes the Land:
               Hard hearted men make Corne ſo deare,
               Few Frenchmen loue well Engliſh beere,
               I hope ere long good newes to heare,

               Now hides are cheape, the Tanner thriues,

               He néeds muſt goe that the Deuill driues,
               God bleſſe vs from a Gun:
               The Beadles make the lame to runne,
               Vaunt not before the battaile's wonne,

               To the ſame tune.
               
                  
               
               
                  THy friend ſuch lewdneſſe ſoon wil check,

                  Of that which thou doſt little feare,
                  And that is, pouerty will grow,
                  Which thy true friend would not haue ſo.
               
               
                  The falſe and fained Flatterer
                  Will ſéeke to trap thée in his ſnare,
                  His words moſt ſwéet ſhall ſtill appeare
                  To get thy money, wine and béere:
                  
                     Theſe are certaine ſignes to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull friend from a flattering foe.
                  
               
               
                  If that thy friend be true indéed,
                  Hée'l not forſake thée in thy néed,
                  Hée'l take thy part in weale and woe,
                  Thy flattering friend will not doe ſo:

                  Now ſome perchance may this obiect,
                  And ſay they are of the true Sect,
                  But ſuch Ile neuer truſt till I
                  Their inward thoughts doe proue and try,
                  
                     Then I certaine am to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  If that you want, then néeds of force,
                  For your reliefe you'l take ſome courſe,
                  Need ſtands behind and bids you goe,
                  The kindneſſe of mens hearts to know,
                  
                     And where once you have try'd it ſo,
                  
                  
                     You'l know your friend, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Thy friend will wondrous ſorry be
                  To ſee thee fall to miſery,
                  And to his power hee'l giue reliefe
                  To eaſe thy dolour, woe and griefe:
                  
                     Theſe are certaine ſignes to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Your faire tongu'd fawning hypocrite
                  Will ſay that you were void of wit,
                  To ſpend your meanes ſo fooliſhly,
                  And lacke ſo long before you dye.
                  
                     Theſe are certaine ſignes to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Then this aduice take then of me,
                  Before need comes goe thou and ſee,
                  Try whilſt thou haſt of thiue owne,
                  And ſee where fauour may be ſhowne:
                  
                     Then thou ſoone ſhalt finde and know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  And looke where thou didſt fauour finde,
                  There be not wauering like the winde,
                  If that thy friend proue iuſt and true,
                  Then doe not change him for a new:
                  
                     Thus to all men I doe ſhow
                  
                  
                     The difference twix a friend and foe.
                  
               
               
                  For my part I may plainely ſay,
                  That friends are apt for to decay,
                  In wealth a man ſhall haue great ſtore,
                  But very few if once growne poore:
                  
                     This I write for men to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  When I had meanes then I had friends,
                  But now I want, their friendſhip ends,
                  Now but few will take my part,
                  Nor helpe releaſe me of my ſmart:
                  
                     This I have writ for men to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull, &c.
                  
               
               
                  Thus to conclude and end my Song,
                  Let me aduiſe both old and young,
                  If thou doe wiſh for many friends,
                  Then haue a care and get ſome meanes:
                  
                     Then you need not care to know
                  
                  
                     A faithfull friend from a flattering foe.
