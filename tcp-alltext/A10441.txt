               THE Church of Englād
(Gentle Reader)
was neuer so defended,
is nowe, we heare say,
it is like to be. For M.
Iewel, being the Scribe, or Secretarie,
and the Superintendentes with
others, being coadiutors and gatherers:
what is it so litle, that they so
manie will not find out, or what is it
so much, that he alone will not put
in? By likelyhoode then, the Booke
wil be greate: marie whether it will
be so good or no, therein is the question.
For triall of which, I haue gathered
into certaine chapiters, the
chiefest maters (as it seemed to me)
by which theyr charge might be set
before them, and to which, the accompt

that they can make, might be
considered, whether it wil answer.

tye and false Argumentes made
in the Apologie of the Church
of England.
            
               The first Chapiter.
               
                  Truth doth redely find enemies and
slaunderers,
                  Apolog.
                  Maior.

                        ion
if
we be at this day tormēted, only because
we teache the truth.
               
               
                  TO shew the faultes of this argument,Confut. p. 6. 7. 
                        •
                     . 9. by rules of logike, it were
an easie mater: but it wold not
be so easily vnderstanded of the common
Reader. For his sake therefore, leauing
the mode and figure of a logical answer,
I wil shew the Absurditie thereof, in
that it may be made to serue for the Catholiques
also, their Aduersaries. For,
Truthe dooth redelye finde enemyes
and slaunderers: But the Catholikes
at this day, finde enemyes and
slaunderers, Ergo they haue the truth.
                  
That the Catholikes haue presently their
enemies and slaūderers, it may be proued
by the whole Booke of Actes and monumēts,
by M. Iewels Sermō and Replie, by
this very Apologie of the Church of Englād.
By al which it apereth, how sharply
the Protestants are set, against the Catholikes,
and how litle regarde they haue
what they write or report of them. Ergo
if thei which find enemys haue the truth:
wherefore then are so many Catholikes,
either in prison within the Realme, either
in hatred of their owne Coūtriemē,
out of the Realme? And if the hauing of
enemies proueth not, the parties that are
hated to be of a good and sincere religion:
it cōcludeth nothing for the Protestāts,
though they shew themselues to haue enemies.
Yea it maketh against them, that
by likelihod their doctrine should not be
good and credible: because they now the
Professours of it, haue all the fauoure
that may be shewed in Englande. The
right forme of this argumēt wold be this.
               
                  
                  Truth findeth Enemies:
               
               
                  We haue the truth:
               
               
                  Ergo we find enemies.
               
               But now the second proposition can
neuer be proued.
               
                  So many thousandes of our brethern 
haue in these last twenty yeares suffred
most painful tormentes:Apolog.
                  
               
               
                  Princes desirous to restarine the Gospel 
haue nothing preuailed:
               
               
                  The whole world now doth begyn to 
open their eyes to beholde the light:
               
               
                  Ergo our cause already is sufficiently
declared and defended.
               
               Death for a religion doth not make a
Martyr,Confut. .13. to the first. As in exāple of Seruetꝰ the Arrian,
whom Caluin procured to be burned
at Geneua▪ and of Ioan of Kent that filth.
And the Anabaptists, which to this day
suffer death willingly.
               So they do make lawes against theues,to the second.
and yet the gallowes are dayly occupied.
So do weeds arise and grow, be the groūd
or gardē neuer so wel tilled. Yet neither
theues nor weeds mai crake of it, that not

withstāding the lawes or diligēce of mē,
thei cōtinue stil ād maintein their race.
               The more like it is, that Antichrist is at
hand. For cōcerning the Gospel of Christ,
it doth not begyn now to be knowen: but
euery day more and more it shuld wax
more obscure toward thend of the world.
               
                  This Gospel therefore, which, to beholde,
the whole worlde now doth
begyn to open their eyes, cūmeth so late,
that we must looke now for the wicked
man to be reueled,2. The
                        •
                     . 2. and Charitie
to wax cold, and faith not to be foūd
perchaunce vpon the earth:Math. 24 Luc. 18. 
                  and not
to haue any increase of faith, hope or Charity,
to be brought into the world.
               
               
                  Oure religion is come at lenght euen
to Kinges courtes and palaces:Apologie. Ergo
God him selfe doth strongly fight in our
quarel.
               
               It came not thither,Confut. 15. before it was sent
for. Neyther do you properly turne princes
to your Religion, but Princes turne
all your preachinges, and procedinges,

to serue their affections. So was Peter
Martir at his first cūming to England a
Lutheran only, but ꝑceiuing afterwards,
the Superiour powers to fansie an other
way, he folowed also them with all the
wit he had, and became an open Zuīglian.
Again, you do wel to resort to Prīces
palacies for argument, because in deede
thence is your cheefest ayde and succour.
               
                  Let the Scripture (saith S. Ambrose)
be asked the question,Apolo. let the apostles be
asked, let the Prophetes be asked.
               
               
                  Ergo we must vse no other force, but
only Scriptures.
               
               It foloweth not:Confu
                        •
                     
                     tion. 3. for after al them, I
may aske also, what S. Ambrose himselfe
thinketh vpon the Scripture, Apostle, or
Prophete. And wher as by many means,
one in order aboue an other, a way is
prepared to any knowledge, the vsing of
the chiefest, must not exclude al the inferiour
frō their places. Again, why hath
M. Iewel stuffed his Reply with so many
allegatiōs of phrases of doctours: and left

it so void of expresse Scripture, if no other
force, but of scriptures, is to be vsed?
               
                  
                      Christ is euer present,Apolog. to assist his
Churche.
               
               
                  
                      Christ nedeth not any man, to supply
his roome.
               
               
                  
                      No one mortal creature is able to cō
                     prehēd
in his mind al ye parts of ye world.
               
               
                  Ergo there neither is, neither can be
any one man, which may haue the whole
superioritie in the Church.
               
               He is present in deede by his power,Conf. 45. To the firste.
and truth, and grace: but to the external
eye he is not presēt, and sensible men require
a sensible Gouernour.
               Christ nedeth nothing,To the. 2. yet for because
of his wisdom ād mercy, he cōmunicateh
his Office ād Glory with men, ād doth not
al thīgs īmediatly by himself: although he
be of suche almightines, that he nedeth
no helpe.
               It is as false as God is true.To the 3. For in dede
the powers of the mind (as the wil, memory,
ād vnderstāding) are by nature of that
making and capacitie, that nothing vnder

God himselfe can fully replenishe it.
Yet if one man alone were not hable by
himself to cōprehende in his mind al the
parts of the world, neuerthelesse by his officers
he may doe it, though the whole
were as bigge againe as it is.
               Last of al, to stoppe your mouthes with
feare, whom reason doth not persuade ye
may, by these argumēts, pluck the Croune
frō the heads of al Kings ād Princes. For
Gods prouidēce (you may say) is ouer the
whole world. And he nedeth no helper,
And no Prince is hable to cōprehend in
his mynd al parts of his Dominion, how
litle so euer it be.
               
                  The Bishop of Rome doth not his
duty,Apolo. as he ought to doe. Ergo, we saye
he ought not once to be called a Bishop,
or so much as an elder.
               
               The persō and the office which any ꝑson
beareth are distinct things:Confut
                        •

                  d,
though the cōditiōs of thē shuld be cōtēptible
for their lust and idlenes. Scruāts

are cōmaūded to obey their masters, not
only whē they be good ād modest,1 Pet. 2. but also
if they be froward. And further, what
are you that iudge, I wil not say, an other
mās seruāt, but your own lauful head and
Bishope? And if yow refuse his Authoritie
for your part: why iudge you yet the
Chiefe Bisshope of the Catholikes? To be
short, if it shalbe considered, how greauous
the Heretikes, and Turkes, ād vnruly
Christians, are to the Church of Christ,
and what hath ben done by Popes euen
in our dayes, for calling of a general Coū
                  cel,
and for defence of Christendō against
the Infidels, and for suppressing of euyll
maners: ther wilbe litle occasion left, to
reproue the Pope for not doing his duty.
               
                  A wonderfull vncleanenesse of life &
maners hath followed vppon the lawe,Apolog.
which commaūded pristes to liue single.
Ergo mariage is holy & honorable in all
sorts & stats of persōs, & it was no good
lawe which did forbid priestes to mary.
               
               This disproueth not the lawe,Coufntation 78. but it
betraieth the foule and corrupt inclinations

of them, for whome the lawe was
made. Without the Lawe, synne was
dead (sayeth the Apostle) And I had
not knowen (sayeth he) what concupiscence
had bene,Rom. 7. except the law had sayd,
thou shalt not lust. So is it, in the actes
of parlament, which are wisely and profitably
made for taking away the excesse
and costlynes of apparel. For, Thou shalt
weare no sylke (sayth the lawe) except
thou mayst spēd yerely by office or landes
a certayne Somme. And by this, one
wolde thinke, that poore seruing men
shoulde not spende so much in their apparel,
as before they did. Lesse robbing
then and filching must folowe, and the
common welth shall be quiet and rich.
But the euent declareth, that it is bestowed
now vpon the making of the cote,
that which is diminisshed in the sylke
that shoulde go to the cote. And superfluities
are not diminished, but increased,
and the mater of them is not taken
away, but the forme is altered. Doe not

therfore put any fault in an holy or goo

and multiply: but reproueth the
coneupiscence and lust of them, which
call not for the grace of God, that they
may be able to kepe the good law.
               
                  We affirme,Apolog that Christ doth truely &
presently geue his owne selfe in his Sacramentes.
Ergo we meane not to abase
the Lordes supper.
               
               This doth not folow.Con

                        •
                     9. For whereas the
mind of Christ is, that in the open house
which he kepeth, his owne pretious body
should be geuē vnder form of bread, and
that so freely and bountifully, that come
who would, either frind or foe, he would
not chāge his word and gift for that mater
(although he wold haue a saying vnto
thē, that by their vnworthy receiuing
did frustrat his gratious benefit) he that
in this case saith, that Christ geueth hī
self truly, really▪ substātially▪ yea bodily ād
corporally vnto thē that do receaue him
by faith ād charity, he speketh vndoutedly

a great and a true word. But if he adde,
that to thē that haue no faith ād charity
he doth not geaue his true and real body,
he abuseth the excellēcy and worthines
of the ꝓuision that is made. For the gift
were not certain, ād perfit, ād cōsisting of
the geuers own power only ād goodnes, if
the faith of the receauer should either
make it, or marr it. You therfore that cā
speake excellētly ād substātially of the sacramēt,
do for al that abase Christs boūtefulnes,
because ye beleue not, that absolutly
without respecte had to any persons he
geaueth himself truely in his Sacramēts,
but that he geueth him self truly ād presently
only to the faithful receauer of hī.
               
                  The Lawe of God is perfite,Apol. and requireth
of vs ful obedience: Ergo we are
able by no meanes, to fulfill that Lawe
in this wordely life.

                  Paul sharply rebuked Peter:Apolog Barnabas
departed from Paul, &c. Did Catholike
Fathers striued one against an other.
Ergo we should not be so greatly noted

               These arguments are naught. For the
testimonie of Infidels against Christian

is nothing worth: but the Sentence
olde Catholikes vpon newfangled Protestantes,
hath much authority in it.
               
                  Paul the Apostle found faults & falles
cuē in ye prime & chief of ye Gospel:Apolog. so that
he was cōpelled to write sharply to the
Galathians & Corinthians. Ergo the
Church may faile and goe amisse.
               
               I answer:Confut. 200. faults may be cōmitted, either
in life
                     •
                   either in faith. Againe particular
churches may erre both in life and faith.
The Church of Rome may erre in life, but
neuer in faith: because the whole church
then shuld be deceiued, as which is boūd
to obey the chief pastor, like as he is prīcipally
boūd to feed and instruct it. But this
is impossible,Mat. 16. Ioa. n 14. the ꝓmises of God stāding,
ād the presēce of the Holyghost assistīg it.

Ergo though S. Paul foūd errors in particular
Churches, this cānot īport, that the
whol Church may be deceued, or that One
Church of Rome, vpō the safty and trust
of which the helth of the whole depēdeth.
               
                  Pighius findeth fault wt many abuses
brought in,Apolog. euē into y• very Masse: Gersō
cōplaineth of a nūbre of most fond ceremonies:
Ergo the Church may erre.
               
               You might wel say:Confut. 206. Ergo a particular
Church may erre in a ceremony or suche
like thing about the Masse it self. But this
is nothing to the purpose, to proue, that
the whole Church may erre, or that the
chief Church of al, which is in Rome, may
err in faith. Now as Pighius foūd fault
with abuses: so haue the Heades of the
Churches geuē charge,Sess. 6. that thei shuld be
amended. As in the very last Coūcel at
Trēt. By which you may perceiue, that although
fauts be foūd in the church, yet ar
they not alowed generally of the Church.

other into Aquitania. He prayseth also
Eugenius the Pope, excedingly, and yet
without flaterie. Whereby it is easy to
perceaue, that all were not like them,
whome he reproueth. And therefore
the whole Churche was not deceiued,
though some were Pilates, and not Prelates.
An other answer is, that this Obiection
doth not proue errour in faith (of
which the question is) but of maners,
which God amend, and which hurt not
the good men, no more than the chaffe
and strawe doth the pure corne.

               First the antecedent is starke false.
Then concerning the Argument, it is
not only false, but folishe also. For it concludeth
an Affirmatiue of one kind, of a
plaine and pure Negatiue of an other, as
if a man would say. The Church of Englande
hath neither Crosses in their churches,
neither order of Monastical life in
their Religion, neither Latine tongue,
lightes or ornamēts in their Seruice: Er
go it holdeth stil a nūber of those things,
which it receiued of S. Austin the Monk.

               It is madnes in dede so to think. And
wher then had you the wit to imagin it?
For what place cā you apoint to a Spirit,
and especially what boundes vnto God?

               If you had bene so obedient,Confut. 281. or if other
were so wise as they should be, General
Councels should not neede. But because
the world is now come to that Infirmity
ād curiositie, that maters must be defended
against al obiections of heretikes, and
brought againe vnto examination, after
they haue ben already determined and
beleued: therefore hath the charitie and
wisedom of the Pope
                     •
                   stoode to the charges
of calling a general Councell, which
facte of his doth not proue, that he may
erre (which the holy Ghost wil not suffer
for his presence sake in the Church) but
that he doth so reasonably and discreetly
order those maters that shal concerne
our Faith, that he wil not erre as much
as mans wit can prouide: but haue also
the Aduise, Consent and Iudgement of
other, which are of most authoritie and

lerning in the Church of Christ.
               
                  Let the Bishope of Rome alone,Apol. be
aboue al Councells: Ergo one parte is
greater than the whole.
               
               No Syr,Confut. 284 not parte greater than the
whole, but parte shall be greater than
parte, and one member worthier than
an other. The bodie and heade togeather,
make the whole: and take away the head
ye take away a parte of the whole. Ye can
not therfore make a diuisiō of the church
into the whole and the heade: but into
the head, and the reast of the partes of
the whole. And then it is no absurditie
at all, that the heade should be greater
in price and honor, than al the other
members beside.

                  Ergo we are not to be blamed for not
comming to the Councel at Trent.
               
               You mutiply examples al in vaine,Confut. 293. ād
there is no proportion at al, betwene the
holy Fathers constancy, and your disobediēce.
For they refused to be at the commaundent
of heretikes and their Fauourers,
but you contempne the lawfull Authority
of Catholike Bishops. If ye could
truly say it, that the Fathers gathered of
late at Trent, were Arriās, Patropassiās,
or heretikes of any sort: then might you
laufully vse the examples of Athanasius,
Chrysostome, Maximus, Paphnutius, and
other. But for as much as it is impossible,
that they could be heretikes, which held
no strainge and singular opiniōs, contrary
to the Catholike, cōmon, and receiued
faith in the whole world: you haue no
excuse left for your pride ād disobediēce.

That Cathalike Bishopes haue refused to
come to the conspiracies of heretikes, ye
neuer neede to haue proued it. But if ye
can shew by any example, that euer any
good man yet, did refuse to come to a Coū

                  A Christian Prince hath the charge of
both tables committed vnto him:Apolog. Ergo
not only temporal maters, but Ecclesiastical
also pertaine to his office.
               
               
                  He hath the Charge of both tables so
far foorth,Confut. .303. that he must defend the external
geauing of due honour vnto God,
and outwarde exhibiting of charitie towards
our neighbour. But to offer vp Sacrifice,
to minister Sacramentes, or to
iudge of Murder, Adultery, Theft, or any
thing that is cōmitted only in hart, hath
he any power? Euery man seeth, that
worldly Princes meddle not with suche
maters. And therefore theyr charge is
baser and narower, thā the charge of Bishopes
and Priestes: whom God hath appointed
to be his Officers in the inward
Courte of Conscience.
               
                  The prophets of God cōmaunded the
Kinges to breake doune altars of Idols,Apolog.
and to write out the books of y• Law, for
them selues: Ergo Ecclesiastical maters
perteine to the iurisdiction of Kinges.
               
               You see,Confut. 303. then that the Princes are not
Supreme, but that betwene them and
God, the Prophete is the greater Officer.
For the Prophets cōmaūd: the prīces obey.
The Prophets geaue charge: the princes

doe execute it. The prophetes declare
what an Idol is, the Princes destroie it
according to the prophetes instruction.

from God,Apolog. and delyuered to the people
al the order for religion and sacrifices,
and gaue Aaron a sore rebuke for making
the golden calfe: Ergo ecclesiastical matters
perteyne to the office of princes.
               
               This example agreeth not,Confut. 05. because
Moyses was not a Ciuile magistrate only,
but also a priest. And he was made also
by God the supreme gouernour and captaine
ouer al the number of the children
of Israel, were they temporal or Spiritual
persons, in figure of Christ. If ye can shew
that our Sauiour left any such power vnto
any king in the world, and that his
Apostles were not immediatly next vnto
hī, the chiefe gouernors of his church:
then shal that temporal King haue the
power whach ye labour to geaue him.

to theyr Iurisdiction.
               
               He receyued commaundement,Confut. 305. to meditate
in the boke of the law, which God
had geauen by Moyses, and to keepe it.
But this was so sar of from a Supremacy
in maters Ecclesiasticall, that it is expressly
sayd in the boke of Numeri,Cap. 17. that
Eleazar the prieste should aske councell
of God if any thing were to be
done for Iosue, and that Iosue should
goe furth and come in at the word of
Eleazar.
               
               And this one answer serueth all the
Examples which ye bring in of King
Dauid, Salomon, Ezechias, Iosaphat, Iosias,
Ioas, Iehu. By which ye wold proue,
that they had iurisdiction in maters Ecclesiastical.
For they dyd nomore then,
than Christian princes doe now, euen
those princes that are obediēt to the See
of Rome. For they buyld Churches, and
finde Singingmen and Priestes to keepe
dayly seruyce, they geaue Bishoprikes,
they put Bishoppes byside theyr offices

(as Queene Marie did put Crāmer an

but as deuout and faithfull Princes,
being glad to doe for the Churche,
whatsoeuer the Spiritual heades thereof,
shal moue them vnto, and being ready
to defend the faith of the Churche, as
they shall learne it of their Bishops.
               It remaineth then, that you shew, not
that the kinges in the olde lawe did set
furth the Seruice of God, displace Priests,
commaūded the temple to be clensed, destroyed
Idols &c: but that they did these
thīgs by their absolute power, without askīg
aduise, leue or instructiō of the priests.
               
                  Constantine called the Councell at
Nice:Apolog. Theodosius the Councel at Constantinople:
Theodosius the second the
Coūcel at Ephesus: Martian the Councel
at Chalcedō: Ergo Ecclesiastical matters
perteine to the Office of Princes.
               
               They called these Councels,Confut. .308. not by vertue
of their supreme autority, but by the
assēt of the B. of Rome. And so Princes

haue to do with the maters of the Churche,

Grace of faith, hope and charitie, and it

to burthen vs with other mens faultes,
or them with the faultes of theire forefathers,
it is against all right and reason.
               
               Why then do you obiect against the
Catholiques the euill liues and deedes of
Popes,Confut. 177. Cardinalles, Monkes, Friers,
Priestes, which may be founde in anie
sorte or condition of men, after some continuance
of tyme and age? And why tel
you, abiding in Englande, tales vppon
Italy, Spayne, or other countries, of Aloisios,
Casios, Diasios, and others, to burthen
thereby the knowen and auncient
Church?
               
                  In tymes past,Apolog. where the first Christians
our forefathers in making their
prayers to God, did tourne them selues
towardes the Easte, there were that
sayed they worshipped the Sunne, and
reckened it as God.
               
               
                  And you,Confut. .191. to proue your selues the
sweete Sonnes, and exacte folowers of
Antiquitie, haue altered the olde maner
and custom of the Catholike Church
by charginge your Ministers, to praye
towardes the sowth, and that in the chiefest
tyme and place of all your deuotion
and Religion. If you knew whether to
turne your selues, after the putting awaye
of the olde faith and ceremonies
thereof, why chose you the south rather
than the East? And why remembred
ye not the first Christians vsage? Except
(notwithstanding the remembrance of
it) you regarded not what they had don
and practised. How absurdly then cal you
them the first Christians and your forefathers,
whom ye disdain, or be ashamed
to folow in the maner of their praying?
               
                  That old Father Augustine denyeth
it to be leefull for a monke to spende his
tyme slouthfully,Apolog. and vnder pretensed holinesse
to liue all vpon others. And who
so thus liueth, an olde father Apollonius
likeneth him to a theefe.
               
               
                  See the pity which these men take of
the old Fathers,Confut. 239. because their sayinges
are not regarded: and see the pityful absurdity
in which themselues are taken,
whiles they would seeme to alowe the
old Fathers. S. Augustine liketh not
the idlenes of Monkes: but ydlenes put
away, did he not alow the order of them?
His booke is De opere Monachorum,
of the labour of Monkes, prouing that
none of them must so thinke hym selfe
addicted to the seruice of God, in praying,
reading, or in spirituall exercises,
that he should not sette his handes to
corporal labour. And he maketh it not
a case of necessitie, that euerie Monke
must labour: but he impugneth theyr
sayinges, which made a necessitie of it,
not to labour wyth the bodie for theyr
lyuing, but to serue God and man by the
labour of mynd only, as in praying, preaching,
and such like.
               Nowe therefore, if S. Augustine
would haue had the very Order it selfe

and profession of Monkes destroyed, he
should haue made short and saied, not
that such monks as wold hold the opiniō,
that they should not labour bodily, ought
to be sette therevnto: but simplie and
plainly he would haue concluded, that
all Munkerie should be taken away.
               And then, how could he make a whole
Booke, De opere Monachorum of the
labour of Monkes, except he would find
some what where nothing is, and build
a house without labourers?
               But you, whom the idlenes of Monkes
offendeth, and the neglecting of the
old Fathers orders: shew to vs, I pray
you, your refourmed Monasteries.Let Heretikes shevv their monasteries. And
if your factes haue declared before, and
yet hytherto your rayling tongues can
testifie, that ye hate the verie Order
and Rule of Monkes, nor would abide
a laboriouse and a vertuous Monke in
your companie, how vnsensiblie doe you
confesse the olde Fathers to haue spoken
againste idle Monkes, (whereby they

signifie no abhomination to be in the
Order it selfe) your selues allwayes so
mockingly and spitefully handeling, not
distinctly idle Monkes, but (without all
addition) Monkes? As maye appeare
by Iohn Foxes no litle booke of Actes
and Monumēts (to name one for all) and
by your great muse in the next sentence
folowing these words of which I speake,
where, you wote not whether to
name them droues, or heardes of
Monks, as though no other title might
be geuen vnto them, besides that which
is proper for brute beastes.
               Concerning the old Father Apollonius,
if idle Monkes be theeues, what
call you them which doe robb and spoile,
not only the idle, but the laborious and
holy Monkes? And robbe them, not of
their house, land, and goodes only, but of
their fame and estimation: and robbe
againe, not only the Monkes, but the iust
and true owners of such goodes as were
bestowed vpon Monasteries.
               
                  But put the case, al Monks had bene
theeues. He that robbeth a theefe, is he
not him selfe a theefe? And if by stelth
a true mans landes be taken from him,
should it not returne in conscience vnto
him againe, if truth and Iustice were
sought for, and not gaine or priuate lust?
How well therefore your Procedinges
agree with truth and honestie,Apolog. lette it
be iudged by the spoyle of Monkes and
Monasteries.
               
                  The old Councell at Carthage commaunded

Scriptures.

the examples of the Primitiue Church,
and by the Fathers and Councelles of

               This is not resonably required of you.Conf. 231.
For where as you without blushing, dare
confesse, that your Gospell began to spring
about fifty yeares sence, and whereas vnto
vs, you graunt nyne hundred yeares, in

nothing more could be alleged for vs, yet
against you, this alone were a sufficient

of Angels, or of men, or of other thinges

whiche he geaueth vpon maters of faith
and Religion, after a more familiar and
truer sorte, then the Catholikes doe
(for they also stand to Gods onlie iudgemente).
Vppon whiche pointe yet being
examined, ye can not but confesse,
that you heare him not īmediatly, but by
meanes of other thinges whiche it pleaseth
his maiestie to vse, so that other
poore men may heare him, and stand to
his only Iudgement, as well as you.
               Therefore, I doe aske nowe further,
by what meanes God only speaketh vnto
you?God speaketh not to the heretikes by the ministery of Angels▪
                   (For I truste without his vttering
of his minde ye are not so well acquainted,
or so excellent of vnderstanding
as to knowe it) doth he vtter his
Iudgementes to you, by the ministerie
of Angelles? But howe shall we beleue
it, excepte ye proue it? And because
ye haue not yet craked of it, surely I can
not yet thinke it.
               Wel,Nor by meanes of men. can you declare that he hath shewed
his wil vnto you, by the meanes and

mouthes of men? If ye dare saie so, 
                     〈◊〉

And further instruct vs, how ye did per
                     •
                  ceaue
those worshipful felowes to speak
vnto you, God his only iudgementes
and not theyr owne fantasies?
               But you haue an other way perchaūc
                     •
                  
to come to the vnderstāding of Gods plea
                     •
                  sure.Not by means of dreames.
What is that? Consisteth it in dreames,
imaginations, mouings of your sprite
within you, and other such prety means?
Nay surelie, ye be not so dreamish, as to
crake of these thinges, which are readie
to depart as lightly as they came, and returne
backe againe as quickely as they
went away.
               Or doth it consist in true visions and
reuelations?Not by meanes of reuelations. That is much. Yet they also
shuld be referred to the iudgemēt of the
Rulers in Christs Church, before ful credite
might he geauē vnto them, because
there may be iust feare of illusions.
               The case therfore being so harde with
you (as we take it) name that meane,

which reioyseth your harte so much, by
which, aboue the rate of other poore soules,
you vnderstand the Iudgement of
God, and stand to it, only.
               
               The Scripture forsooth you wil runne
vnto, and there loe God him self speaketh
vnto you. But how? Immediatlie by him
selfe, or by meanes of inferiour things? If
immediatly: why goe ye then to the Scripture,Ergo by the meanes of the Characters and letters of the scripture. and then the crake is very absurde.
which is needlesse in that kind of
immediate talke? But if he speake to you,
and you heare him▪ by meanes of these visible
characters and letters of Scripture,
of which visible letters, wordes and sentences
be made, and in which words intelligible
senses are concluded, and if: his
be all, that so stoutly ye 
                     〈◊〉
                   of▪ that ye
stād vnto Gods only iudgemēt, it hath
a shew of a great mater, and in deede it
is of no valew, and it maketh the reader
beleue, that you are wiser then other in
your procedings: yet whosoeuer wil cōsider
them earnestlie, shal perceaue that
your crakes are most vnreasonable.
               
                  For in the meanes, which Almight
                     •

                     •
                  
vnto our grosse vnderstandings and sensible
natures, there be diuers degrees▪
and not all of like dignitie or worthines.
As when he declared his minde to
the Fathers in the old lawe, by sending
of Angels in forme of men, and when he
sent afterwardes his only begotten Sonn
                     •
                  
in the truth of our nature,To vnderstand the vvil of God bimeanes of vvriting is one of the basest. And when
this blessed Sonne of his declared what
he was by sundry miracles, and further,
chose certaine simple men and vnlerned
to send them into the world to conquer
al the pride and knouledge of the world,
and to be short, when these Apostles of
Christ, sent vnto diuers places the will
of God conteined in their epistles or Gospell:
In all these degrees, the lowest and
basest meane to deriue by it vnto vs the
will of God, is by Scripture and letters.
               You therfore which by your stāding
to Gods only iudgemēt, doe meane his
iudgement vttered by meanes, and not

immediatly by himselfe, you also which
doe signifie thereby, that you folow a better
and more excellēt way, than other do:
you (I saie) being proued to take the wil
of God vttered in scripture and writing,
for that most excellent waie (which by
all reason, is a more vnperfite and base
meane, thā the appearing of Angels, preaching
of men, or working of miracles)
what do you els, but crake of that as the
chiefest which hath his better, and refer
your self to that as principal, whiche requireth
other thinges to goe before it. If
you wil heare more certainly and principally
that which God commaundeth, ye
must go not to the scriptures immediatly:
but to them that shall tell you what the
Scripture is, and reade it after a Catholike
tune, vnto you.
               
                  The Pope is appeached by vs of hainous
and foule enormities,Apol. and hath not
yet put in his answere.
               
               In what court?Confut. 218. before what iudges? What
yere of our Lord? for what foul enormity?

Your selues may be wel enough Phariseis.
But wher are your scribes, your sumners,
your apparitors, for this mater? Is not
th
                     •
                  s an exceding absurd folie, to appeach
(which importeth an order and forme
of law by you obserued) him with whō you
haue nothing to doe? And to complaine
that he putteth not in his answer, whom
you can not appeach? And which if he
would, knoweth not where anie consistorie
of yours is to answer you in it? Your
selues would not appere, being summoned
to the late general Councel, where out of
al Christēdome there were your betters,
both for spiritual and tēporal gouermēt,
and therefore ye would not because they
haue (as you must now thinke) nothing
to do with you: and now your worshipful
wisedomes haue appeached the Pope, as
though you had iurisdiction ouer him.
               Besides this, if the Popes enormities
of which you speake cōcerne the priuate
li
                     •
                  e and maners of the Pope, may an English
magistrate, whatsoeuer he be, require

by law and conscience that cause to
be brought before him? On the other side
if ye haue appeached, not Pius Quintus
now Pope (a most nolie and innocent Father)
nor anie of his late predecessours, in
this respecte as they were priuate men,
but as heades of the church, then haue ye
called into iudgemēt al Christiās which
obey them, as accessories to their enormities.
And so besides the Pope, Cardinals,
Archbishops, Bishops, Priests and others
of the clergy, either ye haue▪ or by as good
law you may appeach the King of Spaine,
Fraunce, Scotland &c. with al the princes,
Dukes, and States of Christendome.
and yet not accuse them for feare but be
shrew thē (for your office sake) that they
do not put in theyr āswer. Such iudges as
you be▪ such a king was capitaine Kete, or
if that similitude be not fit, you be like to
the madde frontike prince, of whom it is
readen, that he tooke care and ioye ouer
al the shippes of strangers which passed
in great numbre doune by his palace, hauing

in deede (poore kinge) verie fewe
good vesselles of his owne to crake of.
               Trulie, whether the Pope will put in
his answer, or whether he hath receiued
your Iudgement, I wil not striue vpon it,
but, for desire to see the ende of your processe
against him, ye should haue don exceading
wel (me thinketh) to send your
Officers, some to Rome, there to watche
when the Pope with al his Cardinalles
sitteth in the Consistori
                     •
                  : other some to
the Emperour, wheresoeuer he be in
Campe or in Courte, and when eche of
them is occupied about maters of the
Churche and the Empire, sodaynlie let
your Officers come and arrest (I can not
tel yet in whose name, excepte it be of
the Apologie of the Church of Englande,
but it is no mater for the name) let your
Officers doe as you commaunde them,
and l
                     •
                  tte them firste arreste the Pope
an
                     •
                   his Cardinalles, as principall, with
al the Bishoppes about him: And then
afterwardes the Emperour as accessorie,

with all his Dukes and nobles, and bring
them closely to London before hygh commissioners,
and vntil they wil be ruled,
and put in theyr answer, set them faste,
here and there, through all the gates
and prisons in London. For either you
haue no law, or possibilitie, to appeach the
Pope, or els surely ye may by these meanes
constraine him to bring in his aunswer.
The one is as reasonable as the other.
               
                  Although the modestie and the myldenes
of the Emperour Ferdinande,Apolog. be
so greate, that he can beare this, because
peraduenture he vnderstandeth not the
Popes packing, yet ought not the Pope
of his holynes to offer him that wrong,
nor to claime as his own an other mans
ryght.
               
               A lykelie mater,Confut. .313. that the Emperour
should not vnderstand the packinges, if
anie be made, of the Pope, hauing a wise
Councell assisting him, and the worlde
round about sownding of heretiks bokes
and practises, him selfe also hauing (as
ye will not I thinke denie) as muche

iudgement and discretion as your ministers,
of whom yet euerie one maketh
himselfe to know much of the Popes packing,
and goeth with his fardell about
him, and (like a spiritual pedler) setteth
foorth his smal wares in open pulpittes,
and emong all other pointes, vttereth
those of the Popes behauiour, as most gay
geare for the brothers and sisters.
               Note besides this, howe artificiallie
they praise the Emperour for his modesty
and mildnes: because (say they) peraduenture
he vnderstādeth not the Popes
packing. Thinke ye then, that if
without peraduenture he vnderstande
it not, that the hearing thereof doth
proue a mildnes to be in him? So may ye
praise a deafe man for his meekenesse,
when that not hearing the euil wordes
that are spoken against him, he is neuer
moued or troubled with them.
               
                  If so be they whom God hath placed
in greatest dignitie,Apolog. did see and perceaue
these mens practises, how Christes commaundementes

be despised by them &c.
no doubt they would neuer so qui

                     lie
suffer them selues, neither to be disdayned

                        •
                     . but if you for your no litle
wit or learning, were worthie to be in
any great dignitie: you should quicklie
perceyue, that the Princes and Rulers
of the world haue and do vnderstande
as much of the state of Religion, as any
of the Brotherhood. either because they
are wise of them selues, and are set in an
high place, from which they may better
see what is done in the worlde, than other
of base degree: either because Kings
and Princes haue commonly about them,
either wise Coūcelers to instruct them of
all things, Or Courtly Discoursers which
will be ignorant of nothing, Or dissolute
lyuers, which are ready to speake against
the Auncient faith for loue of the late
Gospels libertie and noueltie.

                  Were al things then pure and holy in
Rome,Apolog. when Iohane, a woman rather
of perfit age thā of perfit lyfe, was Pope
there, and bare her selfe as the head of the

               THere was neuer any such woman
Pope in Rome.Confut. .154. Anastasius, an historiographer
of that time, and master
of the Popes Librarie, whiche was
himselfe present at the creations of Sergius
3. Leo 4. Benedictus 3. and other
Popes after them, maketh no mention of
any such. And yet the makers of this woman
Pope▪ do place her▪ betwene Leo 4.
and Benedoctus 3. Other historiographers

also, both old and late, of the beste sorte
make no accompte of her.
               Then he that telleth the tale of thi
                     •
                  
Pope Iohane, telleth it with such probab
                     •
                  
                  litie,
that he must be of smal wit and discretion,
which should geaue anie credite
vnto it.
               For he speaketh firste by heare saie
onelie.
               Then he telleth, that she was an Englishe
woman borne, at Magunce: and
Magunce is high Doutchelande.
               Further he saith, that she was brought
to Athenes by a louer of hers. And therefore
by likelyhood she was more than a
Childe.
               Nowe, what should she doe at Athenes
but lerne a Gods name. And Athenes,
at that time, was not for learnyng,
as being altogether barbarous.
               And yet she not onlie learned, but
profited also in diuerse sciencies, and so
profited, that none was found to be
compared with her. And yet it is

But let the tale goe forwardes.
               How came she to Rome, by what fa

                     〈◊〉
                   fancie? Well, this is not told but as

                     •
                  hough, that there were no more in the

                     〈◊〉
                  , but that as sone as anie fine and
excellent Scholare came to Rome, he
should straitewaies be apointed out to be
the next Pope: so the See being vacant,
this for saied Iohane was (no mā knoweth
how) inthronizated: and yet it is not only
bysides the practise of the Churche of
Rome, but also against common sense and
reason, that anie should be chosen vnto
that Office, whom they should not knowe
by manie yeares experience, and by commendation
of worthie personnes: And
also perceiue by the face it self, to be a mā
lykelie to gouerne the Church discretly.
               
                  But now saith the tale further, be

                        •
                     
with child of her seruant. For ye 
                     〈◊〉
                  
understand, that her old louer was 
                     〈◊〉
                  
dead, or that either she was weary
him, or he of her, and that she kept h

                     •
                  
her seruant begot her with child.
               It is very credible she was past child
bearing, which had a louer before she
went to Athenes, and liued there 
                     〈◊〉

all the short of the heretikes were marred,
except she had a child.
               And

                  , say they, not knowing
the tyme of her deliuerāce, as she wēt
from S. Peters to Laterā, she brought
furth, and dyed. How incred

                  er
abroade, when ieobardie might arise
of betraying her selfe? How vnlikelie also,
that before the mater was opened in
procession, she could kepe it so close, that
none of the curiouse Italian eies, could
perceiue it, either that shee looked not
like a man, or did not so be haue her selfe
as men doe, or were nothīg chainged, in
bodie or countenance, from that pleight
she was in eight or nine moneths before?
               But I wil leaue to make further coniectures:
this is certaine, the best Historiographers
make no mention of any Iohane,Ioannes Polonu

                      a monke and he whom the heretikes at this
time folowe, and which is theyr first author
in this tale, is such a one, as is altogeather
vnworthie of credite.
               
                  To whose eares hath it not come,Apolog. that

                     7. that he was purposely
sent from Rome? As though the Pope
or anie of the Cardinalles had so greate
care, what the poore correctour Iohn
Diasius the Spaniard did, in his masters
shoppe in Germanie.
               How proue ye also, that Diasius his
brother did murther him? For he did
not onely not murther him, but not so
much as know of it, before it was done.
The whole matter was brought before
Iudges, Diasius was deliuered, and he
that in deede committed the murther,
was condemned.
               Howe vniustlie then doe you, to
condemne him for a murtherer, whom
hys lawfull Iudges haue absolued? Yow

will, I trust, repent, or els you will answere
for it, when it shal be to late to
repent.
               
                  Who hurled vnder his table,Apolog. Frauncis
Dandalus the Duke of Uenice, King
of Creta and Cypres, fast bounde wyth
chaynes, to feede of bones amonge the
dogges?
               
               No bodye.Confut. 186. But tell vs now againe,
who hath made fyue lyes in so fewe
lines?
               First Dandalus was not hurled vnder
the table,
                  Sabellic. Decad. 2. lib. 1. but, he came of his owne
accorde. And to moue the Pope vnto
pitie, creeped vppon all fower to his table,
and there layed hym selfe doune.
               Secondlie, he was not then Duke of
Venice. (For their Dukes vse not to be
Ambassadours, nor to goe out of the
Citie) nor Kyng of Creta, nor Cypres.
For the Venetians haue no Kynges in
their State.)
               Thirdlie, he was not fast bounde in
chaines, sauing that one chaine which

he put about his owne necke, and which
he might haue taken of, and gone awaie
at his pleasure.
               Fourthly, he was not hurled vnder
the table to feede of bones. For neither
the Pope doth make any fare so harde,
neither setteth he any man to diner vnder
his table.
               Last of all, that he should be hurled
doune to feede amōg dogges, I thinke
that either the Pope hath none at all,
eyther that he hath other places for thē,
or that he maketh not man and beastes
commensales together.
               Tel me then now, who hath made so
vile, so spitefull, so doggish and so many
lyes within iij. or fower lines togeather?
               And al this shal ye find in the very
History of Sabellicus, Decad. 2. lib. 1. col.
1220. And the Quotation is true, although
M Iewell in his Sermon of late,
did tel it for a worthy point to be noted,
that Sabellicus neuer wrate Decades,
but Enneades. Which if it had bene

true, the mistaking yet of the Title of a
booke was not much to be spoken of, as
long as it is found to be true, that which
is reported, as out of such a booke. But
thankes be to God, there is no harme
done to D. H
                     •
                  rding, because Sabellicus
hath in deede written Decades of the
Story of the Venetians, although there
be extant also Enneades of other Stories
which he intitleth Rapsodia. And M.
Iewel in pressing his Aduersary so earnestly
with such a trifle, and yet fayling
therein also of his purpose, doth proue
himselfe to be driuen very sore vnto his
shiftes, and that he is much to be pytied,
that he hath not like good successe
vnto his greate courage.
               
                  Who set the Emperiall Croune vppon
the Emperour Henrie the Sixths
heade,Apolog. not with hys hande, but with
his foote? And with the same foote agayne,
caste the same Crowne of, saying
withall, he had power to make Emperours,
and to vnmake them againe
at hys pleasure?
               
               
                  You by likelyhood can tel which aske
the question? For vnto vs it is not onlie
a fable, but a foolish one also, and absurde
and malicious.
               
                  Who put in armes Henrie the Sonn
                        •
                     
against the Emperour his Father,Apolo. Henry
the fourthe: And wrought so, that
the Father was taken prisoner of hys
Sonne, and being shorne and shamefully
handeled, was thrust into a Monasterie,
where with hunger and sorowe, he
pyned away to death?
               
               The Pope did none of all these thinges.
Conf. 187 But the Sonne himselfe, after a
greate foile and ouerthrowe, whiche his
Father had taken at the Saxons handes,
seing him to be so strooken with feare,
that he durst not appeare abrode, he toke
vpon him selfe the administration of the
Empire, and fought afterwades against
his owne Father, which would haue
had him to surrender the Empire. And
taking his Father prisoner, he committed
hym to straight custodie, without
anie motion of the Pope therevnto, as

with whome also he was at Variance.
Then, as touching the Shearing or thrusting
him into A Mo

shewe his Authour, and defende hym
selfe.
               
                  Who,Apolog. so ilfauouredlie and monstrouslie
put the Emperour Frederikes necke
vnder hys feete, and as thoughe that
were not suffyciente, added further
thys Texte out of the Psalmes: Thou
shalt goe vppon the Adder and Cockatrice,
and shalt tread the Lyon and Dragon
vnder thy feete?
               
               Who this should be,Conf. 188 your selues can
not tell, whiche are the onelie mainteiners
of the tale. For sometymes ye laie
it to Innocentius the thyrde: sometymes
to Innocentius the eyght: sometymes
to Alexander the thyrde. And
the fact being so strainge and singular,
that it coulde not be but notorious, yet
ye haue so litle certeintie thereof, that
ye knowe not who should haue done it.

But the trueth is, no graue writer maketh
any mention of such behauiour of
the Pope.
               The Emperour Theodosius,

                  g
of the cause.
               Here you speake of sitting,

Councel. You speake also of ordering
the whole arguing of the cause, as
though him selfe had ben a moderatour
of some disputation.
               The plaine storie is,Hist. 
                        〈◊〉
                      9 ca. 19 Theodosius con
                  
                     •
                  erred
familiarly in his owne palace, with
the Bishope of Constantinople, howe his
people might be brought to an vnitie in
faith. And when the heretikes refused
one good way (which was, to be tried by
the testimonies of Auncient Fathers) he
went an other waie to worke with thē:
whiche was, that eche of them should
bring furthe in writing, that which he
had to say for his faith. Which being don,

the Emperour read ouer theyr writings,
ād reiected the Arriās, Macedoniās and
Eunomians heresies, and embraced and
commended the iudgement of the Nicene
Councel, touching the consubstantiality
of God the Sonne with his Father.
So that this historie serueth nothing to
the mater of a General Councel, nor proueth,
that an Emperour may sit there, as
Iudge emong the Bishops, nor that Theodosius
did vpon his owne heade, and as
Supreme Gouernour, that which Socrates
here reporteth of him, but that he folowed
the Councel of his Bishope Nectarius,
and the former decrees of the Nicene
Councel.
               
                  Iustinian put doun from theyr Papal
Throne two Popes,Apolog. Syluerius and Vigilius,
notwithstāding thei were Peters
successours, and Christes Uicars.
               
               No,Conf. 3. it was not Iustinian, but his Ladie
Theodora, which was a great mainteiner
of heretikes, and when women,
theyr husbandes being alyue, be so feruēt

in sprite, that they must haue such Popes
as please them selues, no wounder if
Peters Successours be shamefullie handeled.
               
                  Charles the greate being Emperour
held a prouincial Councel in Germanie,Apolog.
for putting awaye Images, contrary to
the second Councel at Nice.
               
               This is so false,Confut. 327 that the contrarie is
most true. For whereas the heretikes,
named Imagebreakers,Abbas Vrsper. Anselm. Ryd. Pēcerus. Carion. Pantal
                        •
                     o had holden a Coū
                  cel
at Constantinople, for abrogating of
Images: directly against this impietie of
theyrs, Pope Adrian and Charles the
greate held an other Councell at Frankeford
in Germanie. So muche it lacketh,
that Charles the greate should be a fauourer
of Imagebreakers.

ād the Donatistes was this:Conf. 29. 
                  wher
the Church should be? Now, to
proue that the Church was not with the
Catholiks, the Donatistes were busie alwaies,
in rehersing, how the Catholikes,
had burned the holie bokes, ād had offred
incense to Idols, and had persequuted
Innocētes, like as the protestātes in these
daies, whē the questiō is of the Supremacy

                     •
                  
(and did also in sundry places) say truely
                     •
                  
that the obiections of the Donatiste
                     •
                  
were false,Augu. de vnit. Eccles ca. 2. Idē lib. 2. cōt epist. petil. c. 8. and though he might brin
                     •
                  
furth against them also, greater examples
of their faults: yet considering, tha

of the one side or the other, doe not perteine

mainteined thereby, whiles eche part

Churche to be on his side, vseth thes
                     •
                  
wordes:De vnit. Eccl. c. 
                        •
                     . 
                  Let vs not heare, This I saie,
or, This thou saiest; but, let vs heare,
this saieth our Lord▪
                   After which wordes,
these folowe whiche the Apologi
                     •
                  
should not haue omitted, Truly ther b
                        •
                     
extant our Lordes bookes, the authoritie
of which we both do agree with

al, we both beleue, we both serue and
obey: There let vs seeke the Church,
there vs boult out our cause.
               
               For the Church it self to proue it selfe
by her owne wordes, is not conuenient:
And to credit her at the reporte and cō
                  mēdation
of a baser ād vnworthier witnes
then her self, is very dishonorable. It
remaineth therefore, that her cause be
examined by the Scriptures, as whiche
haue so great authority, and are so generally
receiued. And truly it is exceading
wel prouided of God, that, in theyr seueral
causes, the Church s
                     •
                  ould declare the
scriptures, and the scriptures the church.
And so, whē any mā beleueth the church,
and striueth with me vpon a text of the
scripture, I would say vnto him, let vs
haue no more these words, I saie, or you
say, but let vs heare rather, this saieth
the Church.
               
               On the other side, when one beleueth
the scriptures (as heretikes thinke they
do) and would reason with me about the

Church, where it should be, I would
answer: Let not these wordes be hear
                     •
                  
among vs, I say, or you say, but let vs
heare, This saith the Scripture. Therefore
in this principall question betwene
the Catholikes and the Donatists, which
was, where the Church should be,
the best waye was, only to appeale to
Scriptures.
               Againe, the Donatistes admitte
                     •
                  
the Scriptures: but other thinges which
S. Augustine alleaged out of laufull recordes,
either of the Ecclesiasticall, or
the Temporall Court, to encounter them
withal, they did not belieue. And so, I
say, and thou sayest, went to and fro
betwene them, without anie conclusion
or profite. To driue therefore the mater
to some Issue, let vs heare no more
(saieth he) I saie, or thou sayest, but,
this sayeth our Lorde, his bookes we
both belieue, we both obey. there let
vs seeke the Church.
               
               Now in other Kyndes of question,

as, of fasting, receiuing the Sacramēts,
keping of holy dayes, and other traditions,
S. Augustine wold neuer bind vs
to Scripture onlie, him selfe saying of
these and the like, in his Epistle ad Ianuarium.
                  August. 
                        •

                  What so euer the whole
Church thorough the worlde dothe
kepe, thereof to dispute, it is a most
insolent madnes.
               
               Likewise also, towarde such kynde
of Aduersaries, as woulde be tried hy
testimonies of olde Fathers togeather
with Scriptures, or without expresse
Scripture, he would neuer charge vs to
vse these wordes onelie, This saieth our
Lorde: but well would haue bene contented,
that we should saie▪ 
                  this saieth
Cyprian, Ambrose, Basile, &c. him
selfe speakinge of Auncient Fathers before
and in his tyme after this fasshion:
Quod credunt,
                  Contra Iulianū, Pelagianū. lib. 1. ca. 2. 
                  credo, that whiche
they beleue, I beleue, that whiche
they say, I say, &c.
               
               Therefore ye haue abused very muche

your Reader, and S. Augustine bothe,
making the one to thinke, the other to
testifie, that, we should not fight against
Heretikes, but with expresse Scripture
onelie.
               
                  
                     Fulgentius ad Thrasimundum saith,Apolog.
that Christ, tho
                        •
                     gh he be absent from vs
concerning his manhode, yet is euer present
with vs concerning his Godhead.
               
               The forme of a seruant is one thing,Confut. 3
                        •
                     .
and manhood is an other. The forme perteineth
to shape and figure, which couereth
our substance, and maketh it visible:
the manhood perteineth to the inwarde
nature, and is, only intelligible.
The first is not graunted nor taught of
the Catholikes, that Christ is with vs
now in earth, after the forme of a seruant.
The second yet they confesse and
belieue, that he is with vs really in his
manhood. The first is Fulgentius true
sayeng, to the king Thrasimund: The second
is your deprauing of Fulgentius, in
face of the worlde.
               
                  
                  Sozomenus saieth of Spiridion,Apolog. and
Nazianzene saieth of his owne Father,
that a good and diligent Bishoppe doth
serue in the ministery neuer the worse for
that he is maried, but rather the better
and with more hablenes to doe good.
               
               It will neuer (I feare) be better
with you,Confut. 76. but alwaies worse and worse.
Would ye make Gregorie Nazianzene,
contrarie to the Apostle? And S.
Paule so expresselie pronouncyng, that
he which hath a wyfe, is carefull for
the thinges of the world,
                  1. Cor. 7. 
                  and is diuided,
thinke you, that any Auncient Father
or writer (whose testimonie your
selfe doe trust) were likely to say, that a
Bishop dothe serue the better in the
ministery, for that he is maried?
               
               I am glad ye geue credit to Sozomenus
and Nazianzene, vsing them for
witnesses, that we may see whether ye
wil regard their owne very wordes, and
crie them mercy for abusiug them. Sozomenus
saith thus, speaking of Spiridiō.

chyldren, but he was not therefore
the worse to Godward.
               
               How thinke you then, doth he praise
Mariage? Doth he saie, He serued
God the better, and wyth more hablenes
by reason thereof? Doth he not
rather note it, as a rare and a singular
grace in him, that hauing such occasions
of diuidyng and distracting his mind, he
neuerthelesse was nothing abated in his
diligence and attention towardes God?
               Nazianzene likewyse speaketh of
S. Basiles Fathers perfect life in mariage
with A (but yet) saying: Although
he put himself in bondes of mariage,
yet he liued so therein, as he was letted
no whyt therefore, from the attaining
of perfect vertue, and folowing
of wisedome. As who should say,
it commeth most times so to passe, that
when students or holy men are maried,

they looke but seldome on their bookes,
but wait vpon the busines of the world:
yet was it otherwyse with Basiles Father.
For he, although he put himself in
bonds of mariage, yet he was no whit
letted therefore &c. In which words
he cōmendeth his vertue, and geueth no
exāple to vnmaried Priests, that if they
wil be furthered to perfectiō, they should
not be without a bedfelow: nomore thā
he which should report of an other, that
he sitteth at a table ful of delicats, and
yet neuer surfeiteth vpon them, that
proue that it is a right waye to temperance,
alwaies to be at many and fine dishes.
Whereas contrariwise, in all things
that are delectable vnto the senses, and
hurtfull, by excesse, vnto morall vertues,
the safest way is, to flee from occasions
of euill, vntil by longe custome, an habite
be obteined in the vertue. And
then, as it is an argument of greate perfection,
to liue with a woman and nothing
to be hindred in deuotion by her,

so, it is so rare a vertue, and needelesse
(thoughe it be in a man) to be practised,
that as it may sometimes come to
passe, that one is not the worse, yet there
was neuer yet any man so blind and vnsensible,
which would thinke it to be a
preferment toward perfection, to be at
bed and at borde with a woman.
               The more you haue then to answer for,
which haue fathered such a sense on S.
Gregory Nazianzene.
               
                  S. Hierome: Al these things, saith he,
which without ye testimony of the Scriptures,Apolog.
are holdē as deliuered from the
Apostles, be throughly smitten doune,
by the sword of Gods worde.
               
               He saith not generally (al those things,Conf. 30
                  oīa) but,In 
                        •
                     rin
                        •
                     ū cap. Aggaei.
                  Sed & alia, that is, and other
thinges also. And he saith not, which
are holden, asserūtur, but, which they
find and f
                        •
                     ncie, meaning heretikes, of
whom onely he speaketh in that place.
And therefore he maketh not a generall
rule against Traditions, but a special prouision

against the deceits of heretikes.
               
                  It was ryghtly said by Pius the second
a bishop of Rome,Apolog that he sawe many
causes, why wiues should be taken
away from Priests, but many moe and
more weighty causes, why they ought to
be restored to them againe.
               
               His wordes,Conf. 
                        •
                     0. as Platina reporteth, are
these, that mariage hath bene takē frō
Priestes with great reason, And that
it semeth, it were to be restored again
with greater. Note (it semeth) not (it
ought) and note (greater rea
                        •
                     on) and
not, manie moe and more weyghtie.
And if he had so ernestly spoken, as you
suppose, yet dothe he not allowe the mariage
of priestes, whiche he confesseth to
haue bene taken away for greate cause:
but so muche he seemeth to be greaued
with the loosenes of thē in his time, that
he thought the causes why they might be
permited to marie, were much greater.
               After which maner, a very discreet
and sadde Merchante of London might
saie vnto you, that for greate good cause,

Apology wold be so much ouerseen? mary,
aut integra percipiant, aut ab integris
arceantur, either (saieth he) let them
receaue the whole,
                  De cons. dist. 
                        •

                        •
                      Cōperi. 
                  eihter let thē be
kept from the whole. Of receiuing
therefore he speaketh, not of geuing.
               Why, is it not al, in a maner, one? and
can both be receiued, except both be geuen?
No, thei cannot. But who shal constraine
the Priest to geue both? Or who
shal cōpel the Bishopes (whom God hath
set to gouerne his church) who shal compel
thē, to make a law that both be geauē?
For as they s
                     •
                  al see it expedient for the
present state of the peple, ouer which thei
haue authority, so may they, to some geue
both, to some geue one: to some in forme of
bread, to other in forme of wine: ād some
also they may kepe frō receiuing in anie
kind at al, like as by their discretion they
shal see the diuersity of cases to require.
And if ye could īpugne this by any means,
yet could ye not īpugn it by Gelasiꝰ, ād ꝓue
by him, that both kinds ought to be geuē.
               
                  
Secōdly I note against you, that neither
the peoples receiuing in both, is proued
by Gelasius to be of absolute necessity, vnder
peril of committing sacrilege. For he
speketh but of one certain kīd of persons.
How proue I that? By his own words. For
in his cōmuandement, that they, which
were noted vnto him, should either receiue
the whole, or abstain frō the whole
he laieth in, this cause betwen. Quoniā
nescio &c. Because they be staid with
a superstitiō, I cā not tel what: ergo take
superstitiō awaie, and the case of the Receiuer
is altered. And he doth not forbid
a vertuouse and right beleuing mā to receiue
in one kind, vpō good cōsideratiōs.
Shew ye now▪ 
                  that the sacrament ought
to be geauē in both kinds▪
                   ād that some
sorte of people might not receiue vnder
one alone: or confesse, that ye haue made
a duble lie vpon Gelasius.
               
                  What can be sayd more plainly then yt
which Ambrose saith,Apolog. bread and wine remaine
stil the same they were before, and
yet are chaynged into an other thing.
               
               
                  
                  As plaine as he speaketh,
                  Confut. 94. 
                  you vnderstand
him not: and if you do (because nothing
can be saied more plaine) then
doe ye abuse him most shamefully. The
beginning of the sentence or periode, out
of whiche you take certaine wordes for
your purpose,
                  Lib. 4. de Sacr. c. 4. 
                  is this in englishe. If there
be so great power in the word of our
Lord Iesus, that thinges which were
not, should begin to be: how muche
more, is it effectual and workinge, vt
sint quae erant & in aliud commutentur,
that thinges which were, be, and
be chaunged into an other thing. Vpon
the construction of which latine wordes
our present question consisteth. The Apologie
cōstrueth thus▪
                   vt, that (vnderstād,
say they▪
                   panis & vinū, bread and wine)
Sint, quae erant, should remaine styll
the same they were before: & cōmutentur
in aliud, and should be chaunged
into an other thing. Now the true
interpretatiō is thus to be made. Vt quae
erant, that the thinges whiche were:

Sint, be, & in aliud commutentur, and
be chaunged into an other. So that
quae erāt, is nominatiue case to the verbe
sint, and not panis & vinū, as the Apologie
faineth.
               
               For in S. Ambrose argument there is
this antithesis or opposition: from not being
to being, and from being to an other
being. As, if God hath made nothing
somewhat, muche more of somewhat he
may make another thīg. Before the world
began, the Heauens, waters, and Earth
had no existance or being at al. God spake
the word, and so of nothing he made thē
to haue a beginning and being: but bread
had a being, when it was yet vnconsecrated,
and after the wordes of consecra
                  
                     ••
                  on
it keepeth stil a being (because it is
not annihilated, and vtterly made nothing)
yet it keepeth not still the same
being it had before, because it is no more
natural bread, but is turned by the omnipotencie
of Gods worde, into the bodie
of Christe.
               
                  
As in example of the meate whiche
we eate, be it fishe or fleash, it had a being
in it selfe before we did eate it▪ an
                     •
                  
after it is once digested it hath a being,
(for we are not fedde with nothing, and
our meates are not annihilated in vs, but
conuerted into our bodily substance) yet
they keepe not the same being whiche
they had before. For then should theyr bodies
which fed alwaies vpon veale, mutton,
capons, wodcockes &c. consist not of
mans fleash, but of calueflesh, shepes flesh,
&c. And such men were quickely to be
set to schole, or reformed in theyr opinion
least by much vsing of the foresayd meates,
they might proue (in theyr own concepte)
as wise as Calues, Capons or Wodcockes.
               This example wel considered, it will
appeere, that S. Ambrose saieth right lie,
that, quae erant, sint, the things which
were, keepe a being (as bread dothe
when it is consecrated) but not (as the
Apologie abuseth S. Ambrose) that,

                  Sint quae erant, they should remaine
styll the same they were before. For
bread is conuerted by consecration into
the bodye of Christe, and so keepeth styll
a being, but not the same, whiche it
had before.
               
                  Cyrill saieth,Apolog. when we come to receiue
these mysteries, all grosse Imaginations
must quite be banished.
               
               Grosse Imaginations in S. Cyrill,Confut. 107. doe
signifie, not the Catholique beliefe of
the Faithfull, whiche confesse them selues
to receiue vnder the forme of bread,
perfecte God, and perfecte man, One
Iesus Christe: but the carnall thoughtes
and opinions of Nestorius, and lyke
Heretiques, whiche diuide Christe,
that is but one, and imagine, that the
Blessed Virgine was Mother of Christ
man, not of the worde God, as though
the manhoode had anie personall subsistence,
separate from the Godheade.
Of whiche false principle it woulde folow,

that the bodie of Christ, which Christians
receiue in the Sacrament, should
be the bodie of a pure man. And therfor
                     •
                  
he inueigheth against him, and saieth.
               
                  Num hominis comestionem &c▪
what, doest thou pronounce this ou
                        •
                     
Sacrament to be the eating of a man,
and doest thou dryue irreuerētly the
mind of the faithful to grosse imaginations?
&c. Now the Catholikes, which
beleue that they receiue, not the fleash
of a bare man (which could not but minister
verie carnal and grosse thoughtes)

                  e the worde, mysteries, and marke,
that he dothe not meane fleeing vp by
faith vnto heauen, in which place onlie
ye would haue Christs body to be: but rather
a fleyng by deuotion and good mind
to the Aultar here beneth on earth,
where the body, of whiche he speaketh,
doth lie. He flieth high, which cōtemneth
the Iudgement of his owne senses, which
subdueth his reason to Faith, whiche
despiseth the thinges that the worlde
estemeth highlie, whiche conformeth
his life to the life of Christ, which prepareth
him self to the mysteries. No doubt

but we must flee high, not chaunging of
place but cōditions: not by only cōceiuing
of Christ that he is our Mediatour in heaun,
but also beleuing of Christ, that by his
body he worketh our saluatiō in earth: hat
by spiritual imaginatiō, to fede on his body
at his fathers hād al aboue, but with faithful
ād hūble deuotiō, to receiue his real body
at the priests hād here beneth: not by
light esteming of the sacramēt as though
ther were no real presence, but by diligēt
preparing of our selues towards it, as conteining
the body of God our Sauiour.
               Of which two kinds, ye chuse the first
with refusal of the secōd, ād would haue
your reader or herer beleue, that he must
not looke to haue the naturall sleash of
Christ in the mysteries on the altar, nor
beleue any trāsubstātion, nor make any adoration:
for then we should haue Christ
within our sight, our reach, our body, and
haue our maker p̄sent amōg vs in earth,
ād this wil not stand (say you then) with
the fleing high of which Chrysostō speaketh:

But because you abuse S. Chrysostom
herein, therfore I tel you of it, ād bid you

                     •
                  emēbre, that the high fleing of whiche
he speketh, is to be referred vnto the forsaking
of earthly, vile, ād base maners, ād
not to the drawing away of our mind frō
the beliefe, and reuerēce of the mysteries.
               
                  For thus he expoūdeth our fleing high:
If the kinges child araied in purple ād
diademe were deliuered vnto thee to
beare, woldest thou not cast doun on
the groūd al that thou holdest, and receiue
him? But now whē thou receiuest
not the Kings child, but the only
begottē Sonne of God,Chrysost in 1. Cor. cap. 10. Hō. 24. tel me, I praye
the, art not afraid? And doest thou not
cast away al loue of worldly thīgs, ād
garnish thyself with him ōly, but doest
thou loke doun on th'earth? Art thou

geuē to the earth? If it be so, what forgeuenes,
what excuse shalt thou find?

               Vpon which place I would note for my
owne parte, that he sayth not, reach thither
thy faith, but, mitte fidem, reach
furth or put furth thy faith. For this mi

                  chiefe
maie come to the reader of this
word Thither, that taking S. Austine to
speake ther, to thē that alredy haue faith
ād beleuing his words in that place, to ꝑteine
to the questiō of the Sacramēt, he
cōcludeth straitway, that Christs true ād
reall body must not be sought for in the
mysteries vpō the altar, because S. Austin
biddeth vs reach our faith thither, that

is, to heauē. Yet the place is neither referred
to ꝑfect Christians, but only to Iewes,
neither doth it specifie, reaching hither
or thither, but only requireth plain
                     •
                  
geauing of faith.
               Yea ther is so great oddes betwē S. Austin
as he is in his own worke, and as he
is made to stād in the Apologie, that the
worde thither, which the Apologie so
gladly reporteth, is expressly refused of S.
Austin. For to the Iewes questiō, asking
how he might reach to heauen, and take
hold of Christ, he answereth, put furth
faith, and thou hast hold of him, and addeth
after a fewe wordes this cause: For
Christ absent is present. As if he should
say, whē I bid thee (ó Iewe) to apprehend
Christ which is in heauē, I require faith
of thee, and doe not bind Christ to a certain
cōpasse ād circuit, nor make it nedefull
for thee, to clime vp to heauen. For
Christ, as comprehended by faith, is i
                     •
                  
earth as wel as in heauē, and thinke no
                     •
                  
therfore, of chainging of place, but chaynging

of hart, knowing that by faith Christ
is in mens hartes, and is continually here
to them that wil beleue in him.
               
                  As touching the multitude of vaine
& superstitious Ceremonies,Apolog. we knowe
that Augustine did greuously complaine
of them in his owne tyme.
               
               What saied he of them?Confut. Howe sore
did he complaine? What one example
did he bring of them, that you might
gheasse, the Ceremonies which you haue
abrogated, to be of like sorte with those
of which he complained? Why make ye
the Reader to suppose or beleue, that S.
Augustin did loue as fewe ceremonies
as ye doe? Or why teach you him not, out
of S. Austin, how to discerne what is vain,
what is fructful? Let the truth be opened,
and your vanitie wil sone appeare.
               S. Augustine doth so greuouslie complaine,
and he is so ready to diminsh the
numbre of Ceremonies, that the greatest
papist in the world, would not aske
more fauor in the questiō ād cause of thē.

                   First if the Scripture doth alow anie order
or fashiō, it is not vaine. If the whole
 Church hath generally receiued ani, it is
 not vaine. If it be but a particular Ceremony
of one coūtrie, and be not agaīst the
faith or good maners, it is not vaine. Yea
 if anie thing be in it which helpeth to
amendement of life, it is not vaine.
               By so many waies, and for so many causes,
a ceremony maie wel continue, as ye
shal finde in that verie epistle of S. Augustin:
Epi. 119. c. 18. & 19. And had you the face so to alleage
this holy Doctours complaining of ceremonies,
as though he would haue as few
as you? What Sacrament haue you, about
which ye doe occupie oile? What thinke
you of the fast of lent? What of Alleluia betwixt
Easter and Witsontide? What vse
haue you of any Octaues?Cap. 7. 15. 18. Yet of these Ceremonies,
he maketh mentiō in the foresaied
Epistle, and reckoneth that they
are to be vsed and regarded.
               
                  Gregory &c. if the Church, saieth he,
shall depend vppon one man,Apolog. it will at

once fal doune to the ground.
               
               Ye belie him shamfully, he hath no such
words at al.Conf. 203 Yet the protestāt may think
this impossible, that you should haue no
more regarde of your honestye. Let him
seeke then, if he be learned, and iudge by
his owne senses, whether any such proposition
is ther to be found. But is there not
a like vnto it? Ye as, so like as Rome is to
Constantinople, or Gregorie S. Peters
successour, to Nestorius of Constantinople
an heretike. For if a man should seeke for
his life, to find in that epistle, but some resemblance
of that which the Apology reporteth,
he findeth no more but this
which I shal declare for th'vnlerned sake.
               
                  Iohn Bishope of Constantinople affected
the title of Vniuersal Bishope. S.
Gregorie then Pope of Rome, cōplaineth
thereof to Mauritius the Emperour, declaring
good causes ād reasons, why such
presumptiō should not be suffred. Emong
other he maketh this argument.
                  Lib. 4. epist. 3
                        •
                     . Surely
we haue knowē manie Prelats of the

Church of Cōstātinople, to haue fallē
into the goulfe of heresie, and to haue
ben not only heretiks, but archeheretikes
also. Nowe for example, he nameth
Nestorius and Macedonius: then bringeth
he in, therevpon this conclusion. If
therefore in that church (vndoubtedly
of Constantinople) anie pul vnto himself
that name (of Vniuersal Bishope) ergo
(which hath ben the iudgement of all
good men) the whole church (which
God forbid) falleth frō her state, whē
he falleth which is called Vniuersall.
               An excellent argument vndoubtedly.
For if the only or Vniuersall Bishope
should be at Cōstātinople, that see hauing
no priuilege of cōtinuing stil in the right
faith (as appereth by the archeheretikes,
which sate ther) and al the world being
bound to obey the Vniuersal Bishope, this
one absurditie graūted, a thousand would
folow, and that one Bishoppe erring, all
the whole Church should go a straie. Loe
this is al that may seme to geue any occasiō
                  
of reporting that which the Apologie
hath attributed to S. Gregorie.
               And wher find we here, that if the
church depēd vpon one mā
                     ▪ it must at
once fal doune to the ground? Wil they
yet defend theyr lying? Or dare they yet
stil abuse the old fathers? 
                     •
                  s the Church,
ād that Church, al one in cōcluding? Is
depēding vpon one man, and that man,
al a like? The successor of S. Peter, and
Bishop in that chaire, in which neuer yet
was foūd any archeheretike to set furth
naughty doctrin, is he al one with a Bishope
of Constātinople▪
                   which neither
succedeth any Apostle, and hath bene a
defender of heresies? let vs see now therfore
whether you wil cōfesse your errour
in mistaking S. Gregorie: Or mainteine
your impudencie in misusing of him.

These words spake Bernard of y• B.

who nameth him self the highest Bishop
of al, & of y• other Bishops, likwise which
then had the place of gouernement.
               
               How then?Confut. Did S. Bernard forsake al
papistrie and abandon the Pope, because
of those fa

                  ltes which he foūd? If he did,
why taried he in his mōkes cote vnto his
death? If he did not, what vnwise mē be
you, to for sake the Church for euil maners
sake?
               But cōsider further. Whō called he deceauers▪
beg
                     ••
                  ers, pilats? Al the whole order
of Bishopes and gouernoures of the
Church frō the Pope dounward? Or spake
he of some certain only? If he noted but
some certain, ād 
                     •
                  hē worthely: those other
some, which were not infected might wel
preserue the state of the Church in truth
of maners and doctrine, that ye need not
to feare an vtter destruction 
                     〈◊〉
                   it, and so
through wretched foly depart out of it. If
he spake generally of al, then wil I cōfesse
that ye are not so much to be blamed; for
your departing from that Church, nor for

anie your applieyng of S. Bernardes Authorie
to that purpose. But because I am
sure this is false, therefore I charge you,
and blame you.
               How proue I this? I proue it by those
very bookes, in which (as you saie) the
foresaid wordes, against the Pope and
Bishopes, are. For concerning Eugenius
him selfe, he saieth in the third boke,
after much complaint or reproufe made
of the euil maners of the Court of Rome,
Haec ad te,
                  Berna. de Cōs. lib▪ 3 
                  nō de te scribo. I writ this
vnto thee, not of thee. And immediatly,
he declareth by example, how Eugenius
refused bagges of monie, which
came out of Germany and condemned a
greate riche bisshop (by likelyhode) notwithstāding
his mony. And how he gaue
of his own vnto an other poore bisshop to
geue vnto the officers in the Court, least
the bisshop should seeme niggish and
vncourteous, if he should haue nothing
rewarded them. Now Doth it greaue
thee to heare this? And I (ꝙ S. Bernard)

                  doe tell it so muche the more
gladly, by how much thou hearest it
the more greauously. The Pope the
                     •
                  
him selfe was none of those deceauers,
begilers or pilates, whom you mention.
               Furth then: were al the Cardinalles
and Bishops, deceiuers &c. No, neither
al they, as you may reade it proued in the
fourth boke of that worke, by the exāples
of two great Legats. The one was Cardinal
Martine,Cardinal Martin. which being sent legate into
Dacia, a countrie ful of gold and siluer,
returned yet so poore, that for lacke of
mony and horses, he coulde scarse reach
vnto Florence. The Bishope of which
place gaue him an horse, without mention
making of any mater to be done for it.
Yet the legat ād Cardinal Martin, was 
                     〈◊〉
                  
soner at Rome, but the bishop of Florence
came also thither: And seeking the fau

at length he cōmeth to Cardinal Martin.

Take your horse to you, loe, yonder
he is in the stable. This is one, and he, I
truste no deceauer or Pilate.
               An other,Cardinal Gau
                        •
                     rid. is Gaudfridus Bishope of
Cartres, which many yeres together was
at his own charges Embassadour and legat
frō the Pope in the costs of Gascoigne.
Of whō he telleth, that ther was a sturgeō
brought vnto him by a certain priest, but
I wil not take him (sayd the Cardinall)
except I pay for him. Againe, a Ladie
of the towne where he lodged, brought
vnto him for deuotiō and good wil, three
treen disshes with a towel, he beh
                     •
                  ld thē,
he praised thē, but in any case he would
not take them. And at both these tymes
S. Bernard was present. And saieth herevpō
vnto Eugenius: O that we might
haue store of such mē geuē vnto vs, as
thes were, whō I brefly haue spokē of.
               
               If therefore the Pope him selfe was
good, and some Cardinalles and Bishopes

were holie men, how can you witho
                     •
                  
impudencie drawe S. Bernard to such 
                     〈◊〉
                  
sense, as thoughe he should condem
                     ••
                  
the whole See and Church of Rome
                     •
                  
And if (as I saied before) you thinke
him not to speake generally, what helpeth
it your cause, in departing from the
Church, to proue that some Prelates be
Pilats?
               Secondly, I might wel and truely say,
that S. Bernard speaketh against the
maners of the Court of Rome, and not
against the faith of the Church of Rome.
And though he should name the Pope

Then as concerning S. Chrysostome,
he speaketh agaynst suche as neglected
the reading of Scriptures, and thought
this to he a sufficient excuse, for them
that they were no Monkes:Ho. 2. in Matth. as who shuld
sa
                     •
                  e, we haue wife, children and household,
with other things besides to thinke
vpon, and therefore it is not our vocation
to looke in the lawe of God, and by
that to amende our liues.
               He speaketh likewise against other,
which loued to haue faier and trym books
of the Gospel, for ostentation sake, not to
reade them and profit by them. Of which
sort ther may be found, at this presēt, som
in the world, which liuing loosly, and regarding
their soules health slenderly, cary
yet the testamēt or some parte thereof
boūd vp in goldē forel, and hang it about
their necks like a Iewel. But as for the biyng
of Scriptures, he spaketh it by occasiō
ōly, in reprouīg such as had books in their
cupbords, ād no vnderstāding or sense of
them in their mind.
               
                  
For after he had saied:Hom. 3
                        •
                     . in loan. 
                  This hauing
of bookes cōmeth of the Iewish ambition
and craking, vnto whom the
cōmaundementes were geuen in letters,
and vnto vs not so, but in the
tables of our hart, which are of fleash,
least he shuld sem to derogate somwhat
hereby vnto the written Scriptures, he
addeth: yet I do not forbid it to gette
books, yea rather I pray you most ernestly
get them, but so, that we maie
repere often in our minde, both the
letters and sence the of them. He was
not therefore so careful of it, that euery
man shoulde bye the scripture: but this
he studied for, that euery man should be
diligēt in bearing away of the scriptures
readen▪ or preached in the open church.
               Proue ye now that S. Chrysostome
exhorted all and singular of his people, to
bye them bookes, especially in the vulgar
tounge. And iudge ye whether he
had so little discretion to mo
                     •
                  e al therevnto,
which verie few could bring to

passe, the raritie and pryce of the written
bookes being considered.
               Nowe as concerning the other lie,
that wiues at home with theyr husbandes,
or children with theyr parentes
should reason betwixt themselues
of diuine maters: either I vnderstand
not your englishe, or els ye abuse S. Chrysostom
most shamefully. For if ye meane,
that al that reasonīg (which you imagin)
signifieth no more, but that the father
shuld instruct his sonne, ād the wife geue
eare to her husbandes good counsel, then
surely you must pardō me, I neuer vnderstood
this much before, that reasoning of
diuine maters should haue so litle question
in it. But if reasoning betwixt parties
doth importe an argueing to ād fro, with
obiections, solutions, replies, resolutions,
diuises, suppositiōs, &c. And if reasoning
of diuine maters, doth signifie the questiō
proponed not to be of so smal geare, as the
childes education, or the womans silence
which she ought to kepe at home,

but of the Trinitie, Incarnation of Christ▪
value of Sacramentes, Iustification, predestination,
&c. Doe ye make S. Chrysostome
so vnlike himselfe, that ye woul
                     •
                  
permitte a disputation of Diuinitie, betwixte
the man, his wife, and his boye?

one the other in no triflyng questions.
But S. Chrysostomes meaning is altogeather
otberwises: and he would haue lai
                     •
                  
men to read the Scriptures at home, in
maner of repeating, not of readīg or making
a lesson. And that they shoulde remembre
and call to mynde suche thinges
as they had learned of the Bishope, and
not studie themselues vpon anie text at
al, as though they must be preachers, T

                   edifiel
also themselues and others by folowing
a good life, not by seeking a newe

conclusion of Doctrine.
               How proue ye also, that he speaketh of
the whole Bible, to be bought and readē?
For the easie partes thereof, maie be put
into the peoples handes, but the whole in
no wise. The Greeke texte also was not
nor is not so corrupt, as your englishe trā
                  slations.
And to be shorte the people are
nowe more proude and bolde, then at
those daies they were. For then, with
vnwasshed handes they were afraied to
touche only the Scriptures: and now they
take vpon them to interprete them in
shoppes, alehowses, waggons, and feariebotes.
               
                  The auncient Fathers,Apolog. Cyprian, Epiphanius,
and Hierom say, it is better for
one, who, perchaunce, hath made a vowe
to leade a sole life, and afterward liueth
vnchastly, and can not quench y• flames of

                        •
                     uste: to marie a wife and liue honestlie
in wedlocke.
               
               
                  Concerning S. Cyprian,
                  Conf. 237 
                  by his owne
wordes I wil proue that ye misconstre
him. If they (saieth he speaking of

virgins in generall) haue by faith and
promise dedicated themselues vnto
Christ,Lib. 1. Epist. 11. let them cōtinue honestly and
chastly, that no tales be made of thē.
And so be
                     •
                  ng strong and stedfast, let
them looke for the rewarde of virginitie.
But if they wil not or can not cō
                  tinue,
better it is that they mary, than
fal, through their lustes and delightes,
into the fier.
               This is the place, and how doe ye now
vnderstand it? If ye refer it to virgins in
general, that is truly saied in dede: 
                     •
                  ary
it serueth not your purpose, to proue by S.
Cyprian, that Nonnes maie marie. If ye
refer it to virgins alreadie professed, th
                     ••
                  
doth the one parte of the sentence destroie
the other, and it is impossible, tha
                     •
                  
both should hang togeather.
               For if, according to your sense, virgins
after vowe made, might laufulli
                     •
                  
marie: how standeth the former parte
                     •
                  
the sentence, defining, that if they hau
                        •
                     
dedicated themselues vnto Christ, le
                        •
                     
                     
them continue? And when this precept
is to be obserued of virgins professed, how
can it folowe by anie reason, that the selfe
same ꝑsons, should haue it so sodēly graū
                  ted
vnto them: That if they can not or
wil not continue, better it is to mary?
S. Cyprian therefore speaketh of such, as
are free to choose either this or that, and
not of such as are past choosing.
               And againe, if the place were vnderstanded
as you say, then might Nōnes
marie, not onely when they can not
quenche the flames of theyr luste, but
also if they wil not. For if they can not
or wil not (saieth S. Cyprian) better
it is that they marie, then fal through
theyr lustes and delyghtes, into the
fiere. But this is incredible, that so good
a man would geaue a licence so euil: ergo
you doe mistake S. Cyprian.
               Concerning S. Hierome,Ad Demetriadē 
                     
                        •
                     e virginitate 
                        •
                     er 
                        •
                     anda. whome in
like maner ye haue abused: his words are.
The name of certaine, which behaue
not themselues wel doth defame the

purpose of holie virgins, and of the
heauenly and Angelicall companie.
Vnto whom (which whom? Vndoubtedly
such as liued emong virgins, not yet professing
virginity, but intending and purposing
it only) it must be plainly saied,
that either they mary if thei cā not cō
                     teine,
or cōteine if they wil not mary.
               
               Now that there is such a distinction
of virgins to be made, it appeareth most
euidenly by S. Hieroms owne wordes not
twentie lines before this place, saying.
But let this perteine to those virgins
which haue not yet chosen virginity,
and nede exhortation, that they may
knowe what it is, that they ought to
choose. (this is, to virgins not yet professed:
but in the person of the professed,
it followeth) OF VS, the things, which
we haue chosen, are to be kept. Therfore
ye knowe, what followeth: that ye
haue abused S. Hierome, because he permitteth
not mariage to such as haue already
made a vowe of virginitie.
               
                  Last of all, as touching Epiphanius,
these be his words:Epipha, haere
                        ••
                     . .71. 
                  The holy Apostles
of God haue leaft this tradition vnto
vs, that it is a syn to turne to mariage,
post decretā virginitatē, after virginitie
decreed and determined. And the
Apostle writeth:
                  1. Cor 7. 
                  If a virgin mary, she
hath not sinned. How then agreeth
this with that? That is to say, if this be
true, that a vrigin may mary, how agreeth
it with the Traditiō of the Apostles,
that It is a sinne for a virgin to turne
to mariage? Epiphanius answereth by
expounding the Apostle in these words.
               
                  Illam dicit quae non est Deo dicata,
The Apostle (in saying, that if a virgin
marie, she doth not sinne) speaketh of
that virgin, which ys not dedicated
vnto God. Ergo he is not contrary to
the foresaied Tradition of the Apostles,
by which such virgins are forbidden to
marie, as haue vowed their virginitie.
Ergo, to say further: They which accōpt
mariage to be vncleane (as the Apostolici

did, against whom Epiphanius there
writeth) agree not with the Apostle.
And further, they that saie, a virgin
maie marie after she hath made a vow,
(as the compilers of the Apologie do falsly
gather) are cōtrary to the tradition of
th' Aposples, ād to Epiphanius most euidēt
resolutiō, which I haue shortly declared.
               By this it wil appere, whether the aū
                  cient
fathers be wel vsed of the Apology,
whereas S. Cyprian, S. Hierom and Epiphaniꝰ,
whō so closely they name, for witnesses,
do so manifestly testify against thē
that none must marie after they haue
dedicated theyr virginitie vnto God.
               
                  The auncient Emperour Iustiniā, cō
                     maūded,Apolog.
yt in ye holy administratiō al thinges
should be pronūced with a clere, loud
& treatable voice, yt the people might receiue
some fruict therby. These mē leste y•
people should vnderstād thē, mūble vp al
theyr seruice, not only with a drouned &
holowe voice, but also in a strange and
barbarous tongue.
               
               First you make the Emperor to speke ofCon. 242
                  
the holy administratiō, not telling vs either
what or whereof? For ther is an holy
adminstratiō of al the seuē sacramēts, ād
in other things also which the church obserueth,
as halowīg of churches, of paschal
taper, of palma, of asshes, ād in bu
                     •
                  iyng of
the dead. But the decre is referred to the
holy oblation or sacrifice, the truth of
which as ye wil not beleue, so the very
s
                     •
                  ūd of the word ye cā not wel abide. Secōdly
th'emperor speketh not of som fruit
as you say (as though no ꝓfit c
                     •
                  me of th'oblation,
if the priest spake not aloud) but of
more deuotiō
                   to be stirred therby. Geuīg
vs to vnderstād that al is not lost, though
nothīg be hard, but somwhat is won, whē
the sense is more stirred. Thirdly your surmise
that we therfore speke with a holow
voice, lest the peple shuld vnderstād vs,
is vnsensible. For neither the clergy shuld
lese any thīg, if the people were learned:
Nor the people should vnderstād much,
spake thei latin neuer so loud. And heretiks
wold vtter the secrets of our seruice

were we neuer so warie: And no charitable
man will suspecte it of the whole
Church, that they enuie the peoples commoditie.
Then, as for mumbling vp the
Seruice, the Catholikes doe in theyr most
chiefest Churches, sing and saie more
distinctly and treatably, then anie protestantes
doe. And (I feare) if Seruice
were so songe in England, as the Dominicans,
Augustines, Franciscanes, and
Carthusians doe vse, many of the moste
feruente in sprite, would complaine vppon
the leisure and treatablenes, that
were taken in it.
               Fourthely the Latine is no strange or
barbarouse tongue, as being the most cō
                  mon
in this west parte of the world, and
one of the three principall and lerned
tongues.
               
                  Pope Iulius doth euidently forbyd,Apolog.
that a Priest in ministring the Communion
should dippe the bread in the cup.
These men contrary to Pope Iulius decree,
diuide the bread and dyppe it in
the wine.
               
               
                  He doth it so euidently,
                  Confut. 243. that it is not
at all, to be seen in his decree. Shewe it,
that he forbiddeth the Priest to dippe
the bread in the Cuppe (as we vse in
our mysteries) and ye shal be honest mē.
But he speaketh,De cōsec distin. 2. cūomne not of the maner of the
Priestes vsing or receiuing the Sacrament,
but only of ministring of the hoste
dipped in the blud, vnto the peple, which
neither at this daie is allowed. You must
serue vs no more with suche soppes dipped
in lies.
               
                  Pope Clement saieth,Apolog. it is not lawfull
for a Bishop, to deale with both swords.
For if thou wilt haue both, saith he, thou
shalt deceaue both thy selfe and those that

both swordes, and vseth them both.
Wherefore it ought to seeme lesse maruail,

saieth, that is, that he hath deceaued both
his owne selfe, and those which haue geuen

Si mundialibus curis fueris occupatus,
if thou be occupied in worldly cares.
And the Apologie maketh him to say,

both swordes. If Cura signify a sword,
and mundialis signifie two, Or if Occupari
curis be, to occupi two swords,
then hath the Apologie geuen a greate
blowe to the Papistes. But whereas no
such construction can be made, it hath
fought, in this place, not only without 
                     〈◊〉
                  
sworde, but also without a scabberd: because
there is no such word in Pope Clemēt,
in which they maie put anie of the
two swordes that they drawe out of his
testimonie.

               He spake of the prouincial Councels.
And he spake also of his owne time,Confut. 278. i
                     •
                  
which, heretikes did commonly deceaue
prīces, ād by force set vp their new deuices.
But he was not so vnwise, as to mislike

with Generall Councels, or to geaue
an example to the posteritie, of extreme
and vnreasonable disobedience.
               
                  In old time when the Church of God
(if we wil compare it with their Church)
was very wel gouerned,Apolog. both elders &
Deacōs, as saieth Cypriā, & certaine also
of the common people were called vnto
Councelles, and made acquainted with
ecclesiasticall matters.
               
               What were these, certain of the people,
whō ye would proue, by S. Cypriā, to
haue ben called to Coūcels? By this word
certaine, you signifie, that there was an
order takē, who should come, who should
not come. And you make your Reader to
cōceiue, that out of the cōmon people, som
were chosen, which should be present
at Coūcels, as though that had bene materiall
in the Primitiue Church.
               But S. Cypriā saith no such thing, that
any at al of the people,Cypr. in Sententiis Con. Carthaginēsis. 
                  were called to
the Councell, but only this, that when
manie Byshopes, at the first daye of
September, were assembled together
at Crathage, with their Priestes and

Deacons, the most part of the people
were also present. But who sent 
                     〈◊〉
                  
them? Or who thought theyr presence
necessary? or how make you, the presence
of the most parte, to be, a calling o
                        •
                     
certeine of the people? By like reason
you might say, that in al causes, where either
a spiritual or temporal lorde is examined,
the people are called to the hearing
of it, because they are very prone to
vnderstand newes, and are not forbydde
                     ••

                  At the commyng of Christ,Apolog. of God his

of the ful destruction of Niniue, and
of that most beautiful harlotte, then shal

                     raunce vnder theyr masters, be

the mountaines of Scripture.
               
               I note,Confut. .331. in this testimony of S. Hierom,
your lieing sprit
                     •
                  , and sprity she spite. For
whereas he speaketh, not of the Church of
Rome, but of the vniuersall state of the

world which is signified by Niniue, and
whereas you care not what come of the
world, so that the church of Rome may be
defaced: of that, which was but one in S.
Hierome, you haue made two things, and
turne that one, which is altogeather of
your owne making, to the setting furth
of your procedinges.
               For S. Hierom speaketh of the destruction
of Niniue,
                  In com. in Nah. cap. 3▪

a most beautiful ha
                        •
                     lot: and you make
him to speake of Niniue, & speciosissimae
meretricis, of Niniue, ād the most
beautiful harlot, as though that Niniue
were one thing, and the beutiful harlot
were an other. Yet because this was not
plaine enough for your purpose, you geue
S. Hierome the spirite of prophesie. And
verely you thinke he ment to foretell
of the most Gorgeouse harlot Babilō:
So that the beutiful harlot must not be
vnderstanded now of Niniue peculiarly
(as S. Hierome applieth it) but of the

whore of Babilon. Which by the interpretation
of the whorish heretikes is the
See of Rome.
               Iudge now whether this be to interpret
S. Hierom, or to make a tale of their
owne, by the gifte of theyr lieing Sprite.
               
                  Frō thēce sayth S. Cypriā spring schismes

Or where speaketh he of the fountaines

He speaketh in the treatise De simplicitate

head of his Church. But of those fountaines
of Scriptures, we cā not tel whe

                  The Euangelistes and the Apostles &
Prophetes sayinges shew vs sufficiently,Apolog.
what opinion we ought to haue of the
will of God.
               
               This is a true sayinge,Confut. .313. yet Theodorete

               The 5. Chapiter, declaring how Councels
are belyed and abused in the
Apologie of the Church
of England.
               
                  According to the iudgment of the Nicen
Councel,Apolog. we say, that the Bishop of
Rome hath no more iurisdiction ouer
the Church of God, than the rest of the
Patriarkes of Alexandria or Antiochia
haue.
               
               
                  The Canon is:Conf. 50. 
                  Let the auncient custome
continue in force, whiche he is it
Egypt, Libya and Pētapoli, that the bishope
of Alexād
                        •
                     ia haue power ouer
them all, for asmuch as the Bishope o
                        •
                     
Rome hath thus vsed. In these words,
(for asmuch as the Bishoppe of Rome
hath thus vsed) appeareth manifestlie
the prerogatiue of the Bishoppe of Rome,
as from whose maner and custome they
take an example of theyr doeinges.
               For if it should be so vnderstanded,
that because the Bishoppe of Rome hath
power ouer the coūtrie about him, therefore
the Bishope of Alexandria, and not
the Bishope of Antiochia, should 
                     •
                  ule Egypt,
Libya, and Pentapoly: that hangeth
no better togeather, than if you should
say, let the Bishop of Canterbury be Archbishop
of Yorkeshire or Ireland, because
the Bishoppe of Rome hath power ouer
the Countreies about him. And allthoughe
this Argument maie seeme to
conclude à Simili, thus (as, the Bishoppe

of Rome ruleth his Countrie, so let euerie
Metropolitane in like maner beare
rule ouer his owne Countrie) yet to appointe
by name, either Eygpte to the Bishope
of Alexandria, or Ireland to the
Bishop of Canterbury, that must depēd of
some other cause, and not of this, that the
Bishop of Rome hath iurisdictiō in Italy.
               Now consider the mater as the truth
is, that the Bishoppe of Rome hath supreme
authoritie emong al Bishopes, and
then it foloweth by good reason, that the
Bishop of Alexandria shall rule Egypt,
because the Bishop of Rome hath so vsed.
That is, because it is so apointed and so
receiued at Rome, that Aegypte, Libya
and Pētapolis should perteine to the Bishoppe
of Alexandria: therefore let that
order continue.
               And this is the meaning of the Nicene
Councell, and this maketh for the
Popes Supremacy, and this proueth you to
belye the Nicene Coūcel, which hath not
at al, any such wordes as you mention,

                  that he hath, no more Iurisdiction ouer
the Churche, than the rest of the
Patriarches.
               
               
                  The Councel of Carthage,Apolog. did circumspectely
prouide, that no Bishoppe
shoulde be called, either the highe Bishope,
or Chiefe Priest.
               
               The Councell doth not say (No Bishope)
but,Conf. 53. 
                  A Bishop of a first See, shal
not be called Chiefe of Priestes or highest
Priest. For whereas there be other
priestes besides in the world, which are
not subiect vnto his see: reason it is, that
his title extend it selfe to no more than
those that are vnder his Iurisdiction. Also
this Canon was for the Bishopes of the
prouinces of Aphrica. And last of all it
extendeth it selfe, only to the first sees,
which are many according to the numbre
of Countries, and not to the Apostolike
See, and chiefe aboue all, which is
but one.
               
                  The Councel of Nice,Apolog. as is alleaged
by some in greeke, plainly forbiddeth vs

to be basely affectiouated or bent toward
the Bread and Wine, whiche are sette
before vs.
               
               
                  This disproueth nothinge at all the
real presence of Christ in the Sacramēt,
                  Conf. 108
                  especiallie if you would haue added that
whiche foloweth in the verie selfe same
sentence, and not haue clipped so worthie
a Councell. For it foloweth thus:
But lyfting vp our minde, lette vs by
faithe, vnderstand, on that holy table
to be laied the lābe of God, that taketh
away the synnes of the world, which
is sacrificed of Priestes, vnbloudelie:
and receiuing his preciouse body and
bloud verely, let vs beleue these to be
the pleadges of our resurrection.
               Therefore the Councel in forbidding
vs to be baselie affected, intended not
to make vs beleue that Christ is in heauen
onlie, and not also vpon the Aultar.
               
                  The old Councell at Rome decreed,Apolog.
that no man should come to the seruice
saied by a Priest well knowen to keepe a
Conucbyne.
               
               
                  We find no such Canon in the old Romaine
Councels. But Nicolaus and Alexander
Popes, haue willed, that none
should heare the Masse of that Priest,
whom he knoweth vndoutedly to kepe 
                     •
                  
Concubine, whereby ye may vnderstand
the masse alowed, and the lustes of the
Clergie punished, and your mistaking of
the Councell corrected.
               
                  The olde councell Gangrense,Apolog. commaundeth,
that none should make suche
difference betwene an vnmaried Priest &
a maried Priest, as he ought to thinke
the one more holy than the other for single
life sake.
               
               The wordes be these,Confut. 240. 
                  If anie make
a difference of a Priest who hath ben
maried, as thoughe when he sacrificeth,
a man might not communicate
with his oblation, accursed be he. The
Councell therefore speaketh of suche as
were first maried, and afterwardes toke
Priesthode vppon them, and not contrarywise,
of such as were first of all pristes,

and then afterwards did fall to mariage.
In which poynte the obiection of
Catholikes against you, consisteth.
               
                  The Councell at Carthage cōmaunded,Apolog.
nothing to be reade in Christes cō
                     gregatiō,
but the Canonical Sciptures.
               
               Why reade you then Homelies of your
owne making?Conf. 24
                        •
                     
                   But to the matter. The
wordes of the councel are these. It hath
seemed good vnto vs, that besides the
Canonical Scriptures nothing be red
in the Church vnder the name of the
holy Scriptures. Therfore it forbiddeth
not the reading of other thinges, but in
that sort, as they should be commended
and vttered for Scripture it selfe. And
strait wayes it foloweth in the same decree.
Let it be lauful also for the passiōs
and deaths of Martyrs to be read,
whē their yerely feasts are kept. Doe
you see your lie now, and wil ye lowly cō
                  fesse
it? Or are ye so froward, that ye wil
not see it, or are ye so cunning, that ye cā
defend it? Your cōfession or defensiō we

are content te heare, but if you will be
blinde, lette others behold and consider,
that nothīg but Canonical Scripture,
and the, deathes of Martyrs to be readen
also in the Church, can not both be
true and stand togeather.
               And beholde whiles I thought this
obiection could not possibly be refelled, it
was for certainty reported vnto vs here
by some that were present at M. Iewels
sermō at Poules Crosse the fiftenth of Iuly
last, that he complained that M. Doctor
Harding wrōgfully charged the authors
of the Apologie with this place, as
being a manifeste abusing and mangling
of the third Coūcel of Carthage. For, sayd
he, we alleage not this out of the Coūcel
of Carthage, but of the Councel of Hippo.
               Did ye so in deede? Is not your Apologie
therin against you? Is not the Coūcell
of Carthage both named in the Text, and
noted in the margent thereof? Your Latine
is thus.In Apol. Ecclesi. Angl. 
                  Vetus Concilium Carthaginense
iubet, ne quid in Sacro coetulegatur,

praeter scripturas Canonicas,
ād in the margēt, thus it is noted. Tertiū
Carth. ca. 47. And the English interpretation
hath thus: The old Councel at
Carthage cōmaunded nothing to be
readen in Christes cōgration, but the
Canonical Scriptures: and there lykewise
in the margent ye put Concil. Car. 3.
cap. 47.
               How dare ye then so loudly to lie, that
ye alleaged the foresaied place out of the
Councel of Hippo, and not the Councell of
Carthage? It appereth well, that Doctor
Harding hath ye vpon the hippe, when
to saue your selues from the fall, ye deny
your owne words.In his reply to D. Cole. And wonder it is, that
M. Iewel would euer be the reporter of
such an answer,In his replie to D Harding .157. whereas himselfe hath
vsed this very place of the Coūcel of Carthage
to like effect ād purpose, as ye haue
vsed it in your Apology. Especially wheras
there is no Councel of Hippo extant at
al, vnto which yet ye refer your selues. Cō
                  sider
therfore (Indifferent reader) of this

place, and suffer not thy selfe so to be abused,
that they shal make thee beleue, that
they alleaged not that Councell, whiche
thou maiest see with thy owne eyes to
be named and quoted in theyr Apologie,
and that they folowed the Canons of the
Councell of Hippo of whiche they can
shewe no Canons at all, that are extant.
               
                  In the Councell at Chalcedone,Apolog. &
Ciuile Magistrate condemned for Heretiks
by the sentence of his owne mouth,
the Bishoppes, Dioscorus, Iuuenal, and
Thalasius, and gaue iudgement to put
them from that promotion in ye Church.
               
               In what parte of that Councell,Conf. 315. maie
one finde this which you reporte? In the
thirde Action we doe reade, that Paschasius
with his two felowes the Legats
of the Pope of Rome, pronounced the
sentence of condemnation against Dioscorus,
the forme whereof is fully there
expressed. How then? Shall we thinke,
that one of the Popes Legates was a Ciuill
Magistrate? Or that the Ciuil Magistrate
condemned Dioscorus ageine by

                  the sentence of his own mouth, when
he was sufficiently iudged, by the whole
Councel of Bishopes? Ye haue manie fetches,
yet you can not but be conuinced
in this place of an impudent lye, or extreme
folie.
               The most that ye might saie (as farre
as we can reache) is, that the Ciuile magistrate
subscribed vnto the sentence of
the Councell, and by his voice also condemned
Dioscorus for an heretike. But
this is not inoughe for you, to saue your
honesties. For you must declare, that the
ciuil magistrat, not only cōdēned them,
by his testimonie or assent, but also by his
sentence, and not such a sentence only
as might concurre with the iudgmētes
of the Superiours (lyke as euery bishoppe
in a general Councel geueth sentence in
causes Ecclesiasticall. But it is included
within that one sentēce which the chiefest
in al the Councel do alow and geue)
but you must ꝓue, that the ciuil mgistrat
gaue the sentēce with his own mouth.
                  
For so ye speake as though he had ben the
the best man in the place and president
of the Councel.
               To this of Dioscorus that ye may aunswer
the more fully, I wil not troble yo
                     •
                  
with Iuuenal and Thalassius, whome ye
haue also belyed in this mater, Bishopes
of an other sorte than Dioscorus was, although
you haue cōdēned them together.

                        •
                     .
Where finde ye these wordes in S. Paul?
That men should not away with holsome
doctrine, it is to be founde in the fourthe
chap. of the seconde to Timothe. And it is
verified in all heretikes: but that S. Paul

                     •
                  hould referre those wordes to the very
Church it selfe, it is impudently attributed

to the Apostle.
               And to graunte vnto you as muche
as might be, for excuse of your wordes,
that in some sense it might be true,
that euen within the verie Churche
men shoulde not away with holsome
Doctrine: that is, that althoughe
manie, for theyr vnderstandinge dissented
not from it, yet in theyr lyuing
they shoulde impugne it: Yet, to saye
as you doe, that S. Paule dothe expound
his woordes of the verie Churche, it
is altogeather boldelie, and falselie affirmed.
               
                  God,Apolog. by hys Prophetes often and
ernestly commaundeth the King &c. To
wryte out the booke of the Lawe for
hym selfe.
               
               Ye bring this place to proue,Conf. 303 that temporal
Princes haue as much to doe with
Religion, as Bishoppes and Priestes.
For the Kinge (saye you) muste write
out the Lawe.Deut. 17. But whie leaue ye out
that whiche foloweth, accipiens exemplar,

takynge the Copie of the
Priestes of the Trybe of Leuie? By
which woordes it is clearlie perceyued,
that it is not in the Kynges handes to
meddle with Scriptures, but as he receaueth
them of his betters (in that authoritie)
the Priestes.
               
                  King Ioas bridled the riot and arrogancie
of the Priestes.Apol.
                  
               
               We finde no such wordes in the text,Conf. 307

there, but onelie that he shoulde passe

                  eople: but, of Religion, Sacrifice, Praying
for the people, expounding the Law
&c. no one sentence. Yea rather (as it
appereth in the first setting of him, in his

office) the scripture saieth expressly, 
                     
                        〈◊〉

                  Nu, 27. At his worde (vndoubtedly
at the Priests) he shal goe furth and
come in &c. Which of the two then 
                     〈◊〉
                  
nerer to God, ād worthier by his office? He
that speaketh himselfe with God, or he
that heareth God his word by any interpretatour?
He which geaueth the commaundement,
or he which must obey it?
               Doe no more so, with the scriptures,
ād if none shal let you, to make your own
sense vpon them: yet neuer take so much
vpon you, to put in the text it self, which
is not of the Scripture. And further consider,
whether this be not to adde and
take awaie from the Scripture, to make
that of the plural nūber, which is of the
singular only: To suppresse those wordes
which being put in, doe dissolue the kno
                     •
                  
of the question: To put that in, whiche is
not at al in the text: To alleage sayinges
that can not be found: And to misconstrue

sentences that are founde. And
then, when you haue considered all this,
conferre therewith, that which ye finde
in the Apocalipse of S. Iohn, that, If
any man adde vnto these things,
                  Apo vl. 
                  God
shal lay vpon him the plagues that are
written in this booke. And if anie
man diminishe of the wordes of the
booke of this prophecy, God shal take
his part out of the booke of life, and
out of the holy Citie, and from these
things which are writtē in this booke.
               
            
            
               The 7. Chapiter, conteining the
flat lyes of the Apologie.
               
                  There haue ben wittely procured by
the Bishop of Rome certaine persons of
eloquence enough,Apolog. & not vnlcarned neither,
which should put their helpe to his
cause now almost desperate.
               
               NAme the Pope which hath procured
them:Confut. 9 Name the Persone
which haue ben procured, and ye
shal either confesse your faultes, or stand

gyltie for two lyes.
               Proue also, that he wylely procured
ani mē to help his cause: because this word
wylely maketh your lye ād slaūder more
greeuous. For either you meane, that he
did it in d
                     •
                  de, and that he would not be
sene to doe it, either that he did it boldly
and manifestly, but yet vsed a witty and
subtil meane vnto it.
               Concernīg the first, he neded not to be
ashamed to defend his cause. He might
boldly without reproch choose any of the
lerned ād eloquēt Catholiks for that purpose.
For, the faith which the whole Churche
opēly cōfesseth▪ what dishonesty at al is
it, to cōmaund aloud, that the best lerned
shuld declare it, and by declaring of it cō
                  mēd
it, that whē iust cause is geuē of it, it
mai be knowē for a truth sufficiētly, pued.
               Concernīg the second, it were a small
part of policy, to labour by a fancy to perswade
the whole world in a falsitie.
               
                  Princes desirous to restrain ye gospel
sought many wayes,Apolog. but preuailed nothing:
& now almost ye whole world doth

begyn to opē their eies to behold y• light.

your gospel in France? Whē Lady Marie
was once proclaimed Queene, how preuailed
your preachīg? Did ye not flee beyond
sea into free Cities? And why into
those more thā into ani other? but because
ye preuaile not with Princes, but such as
cal you to their fauour, of whō yet ther are
so few, and so weak in al Christēdom that
in the rekning they make a litle somme.
And now (say you) the whole world almost,

But why say ye not (without almost) that

by your gospel, would ye put out your
almost?
               
               
                  What meane ye by this almoste? Perchance
all is ouercomed with you, sauing
Rome itselfe, and the small Cities about
it. Nay, haue ye not greate and Princely
states, (as of Florence, Vrbine, Genua,
Ferrara, Millaine, Venice, Treuers, Mentes,
Colone, Salisburg, and the Catholike
Cantones) And sundrie Countries (as
Bauarie, Sauoy, Burgundie, Loraine,
Brabrant, Flaunders, Holland, Artoys,
Henaut, Friseland, Guelderland, Cleueland,
Prussia, Carinthia,) And many Ilandes,
(as Sicilia, Corsica, Sardinia,
Maltha and the Zelāds) And many kingdoms
(as Naples, Frāce, Spaine, Pole, Bohemie,
Hungary, and Portugale) and the
Empire it selfe, which see well enough
how darke your gospel is? But no matter
for these small peeces.
               What say you then to the new Indians,
which alone are greater, than all,
whom we haue rekened? If you lacke but
them alone, haue you all the world all

which had so wōderful good successe, and
which is so executed in Rome it selfe,

of all, noble personages when they haue

of so many Kinges.
               
               Euery Anabaptist in Brabāt or Scotlād,
liueth against the Prīces wil, because he
generally wisheth euery heretike out of
the way, for feare of infecting the good
Chistiās: yet ther is another wil in Prīces,
which if they would folow, no heretike
could haue peeped vp in all Christēdom,
but he shuld haue ben quikly dispatched.
               
                  In spite of the Popes.
               
               That is true in one sense, because in
deed very spite hath moued diuers mē to
refuse his authority: but in an other it is
false. For if he (for exāple) had stomaked
the matter, he had held them for excō
                  municate
which should haue the name of
Kīg Hēry in their bokes, like as on the cō
                  trary
side it was high treason to haue the
name of Papa in any writing or Calēder.
               
                  And almost maugre the head of al men,

                  Here again commeth in almost. No,
if men had resisted it in deede, it had
neuer ben receiued. But partly through
couetise of Church goods, partly through
werines of straight liuing partly through
hatred of superiour powers, and partly
through curiosity to heare what newes
came out of Germanie, the merchandise
of heretikes had an open vent.

               It is false,Confut. 27. as it appeareth by the first
Nicene Coūcel, declaring the cōsubstantiality
of God the Sōne with his Father.
The second Councell at Constantinople,

resorting to the writinges of theyr for fathers
for profe of the Godhead of the holie
Ghost. The Councel at Ephesus, defining
our blessed Ladie to be Deiparam,
the Mother of God, and not only Christiparam,
the mother of Christ: And the
Councel at Calchedon where the fathers
cried out aloud against Eutyches (denieing
the two natures in Christe, and asking
in what Scriptures laie the two natures)
Ea quae sunt Patrum teneantur.
Those things which the Fathers haue
thought, let them be kepte.
               
                  If there had bene any whiche would
be but a looker on and abstaine from the
holy Cōmunion,Apolog. him did the old fathers
and Bishops of Rome in the Primatiue
Church, before priuate Masse came vp,
excommunicate as a wicked person and
as a Pagane.
               
               How proue ye this?Con. 92. Marie out of a decree
of Calixtus, or as ye should say Anacletus.
Yet he speketh not of al the people,
but of the clergy onli▪ which he apointeth
to attend vpon the Bishop at the aultar:

which are to saie, seuen, fiue, or three
Deacons, likewise, Subdeacons, and other
ministers. Neither are they excommunicated
if they doe not receiue, but willed
to be kept without the Church dores: a
far lesse punishment, so far furthe at the
least, that it proueth you a lyer.
               
                  Our aduersaries at this day haue violently
thrust out and quite forbydden the
holy Communion.Apolog.
                  
               
               They haue so forbidden it,Conf. 9
                        •
                     . that seeing
th
                     •
                   slewth of the common people, they
haue made an expresse law, that whosoeuer
doth not communicate at Easter, shal
not be taken for a Christian.
               And bysides, if it be to far for you to
goe to Rome it selfe, whereas the examples
of the primitiue Churche continue
in theyr best practise, you maie aske of
the Churches of Flāders and Brabāt, and
if there be not more receiuing at euerie
principal feast in the yere, thā is church
for church, in the whole yeare with you,
then let me be reproued. And this ofte

receauing of Catholike people, can not
stand wyth a violent thrustyng out,
and a forbidding the holy communion,
as you belie the Clergie.
               Now, if by the holy communion
ye meane not, the receiuing of the Sacrament
as Catholykes vse, but receiuinge
vnder bothe kindes, neither in
that sence speake you truely. For no
violence was vsed whiles one kind only
was ministred, no commaundement
driuing the Christians at the first vnto
it, but their owne willes and deuotions
allowing it: neither, by anie later Canon
of the Churche are both kindes so quite
forbidden, but that vpon good aduise
and charitable consideration, both may
be graunted.
               
                  The Bishoppes of Rome doe carie
the Sacramentall bread aboute,Apolog. vppon
an amblyng horse whither so euer them
selues iourney.
               
               What if he would ryde twelue miles
or seuen miles out of Rome,Confut. 111. doth he carie

the Sacrament with him vppon an
horse? No forsothe. Ergo not whether
so euer he iourneieth.
               
               Againe, howe doth he carie it? In
lyke sorte, as noble men carie theyr necessaries
with them vpon Sūpter horses,
or packe vp in casketes trūkes or males
anie of theyr singular and pretiouse iewelles?
Surelie the simple and plaine
Reader, maie thinke vpon the credite of
your woordes, that the Pope when he
rydeth out of towne, carieth the Sacrament
inclosed vp with him, and set vppon
some horse, as though it were perteyninge
to his household prouision.
               Yet the truthe is farre otherwyse: for
in solemne and greate processions onelie,
the Sacrament is cariede about.
               But, I truste, a Procession, is none of
the Popes iourneys, neither muste his
holines be sayed to ryde out of towne, whē
he goeth about the Cytie in his Bishoppelie
Ornamentes for praiers sake onelie
and deuotion.
               
                  
Now when such high feasts do come, the
mōstrāce or pix for the Sacramēt being
verie greate and massy, is sette in deede
vpon an horse, not as a cariage of the Popes,
but as conteining a Sacrament of
the Christians. Which, that it might be
the better in syght, and with more ease
caried about, therefore hath it pleased
the deuotion or inuention of no euil mē,
to prepare a fayre horse to carie vppon
his backe the pix in which that bodie is
kepte vnder the forme of bread, whiche
disdayned not to ride vpon an Asse,Matt. 21▪
                   whē
it came into Hieruselem in visible forme
of fleash.
               
                  They say,Apolog. and sometyme do perswade
fooles, that they are able by theyr Masses
to distribute and apply to mens commoditie
all the merites of Christe his death,
yea although many tymes the partyes
thinke nothing of the mater, and vnderstand
ful litle what is done.
               
               Name them that doe saie so,Confut. 115. and you
shalbe discharged of a lie, and they punished
for their words. For the Catholiks alow

not these phrases: we are able to distribute
by our Masses &c. As who
should say, the Priest were no more a sinfull
mā, nor an hygh minister, at the most
vnder God, but were in dede a certaine
God, and had in his owne power to pleasure
whom he listeth: which is nothing
so. For if we shal consider the acte of the
Priest as it is his owne Psonal, so doth he
according to his deuoute intention, not
by authoritie, but by supplication, obtaine
a vertue and influence to come frome
Christ, to them for whom he specially offereth.

                     •
                   But himselfe also being a poore
wretche and compassed with infirmitie,
he neuer learned of the Church so proudly
to speake as, that, I am able to do this
by my Masse.
               
               Againe, if it were true, and if the
Church did so teache, that the Priest is
able of his own self without asking leaue,
to make applications of Christes merits,
(which in dede is not so) yet to say, that
he maie applie al the merites of Christes

passion, is altogeather impossible. For
whereas there is no proportion betwen
a finite thinge and an infinite: the Priest
which hath a limited Authoritie, and
such a power as hath an end, how can he
stretche it to the distributing of all the
merites of Christes death, whiche are
endelesse and infinite? Therefore I saie
discharge your selues.
               And concerning that absurditie by
which you would encrease your readers
indignation against our cause, saying,
that we distribute and applye Christes
merites when the parties thinke
nothing on the mater, that is not so vnreasonable,
as the vnwise brother would
thinke it. Whereas the praiers of the English
congregation (if in dede God accepted
them) maie procure strength in the
Lorde, vnto the brothers of France or
Germanie, although they were either a
sleping or drinking.
               
                  It is a shameful parte and ful of infidelitie,Apolog.
that we see euerie where used in

the Churches of our Aduersaryes, that
they wil haue innumerable sortes of mediatours.
               
               
                  Innumerable.
                  Conf. 12
                        •
                     
                   This is one plaine lye.
For the Churche knoweth but two, the
one when the party which commeth in
betweene to entreate and make peace,
maie by equalytie or Authoritie, haue to
doe with both, of whiche sorte Ihesus
Christ alone is a mediatour, being perfite
God nothing inferiour to his Father,
and perfite Man, nothing disdaining a
man: The other when by waye of requeste
onelie and by intercession, the
freindes and acquaintaunce of both sides
speake a good worde and fauorable,
for the partie distressed, vnable by them
selues to commmaunde or woorke anie
thing, but by the fauor and especiall grace
of him whiche hath the better. Of this
sorte are all the Saintes of heauen a

Blessing to your hart, that you care for

of God pray for me.
               
               
                  What would these men haue saied,Apolog.
when in al Councels newe ordres & new
decrees continually were deuised?
               
               Marie we would haue stoode to the
Catholike Coūcels,Confut. 186. in which new Credes
from the old were neuer made, but the
old made more plaine, by expounding in
plainer words the faith that was before.
               
                  Some of the Fryers,Apolog. and Monkes,
put a greate holynes in eating of fyshe,
and some in eating of hearbes, some in
wearing of shewes, and some wearing of
Sandales, some goeing in a linen garment,
and some in wollen.
               
               If by some ye meane special persons,Confut. .143. I
can not tel what, nor where: When ye
name them to vs, or wil send your charitable

letters to them, I warrant you they
shal be spoken withal. But whereas this
appertaineth not to the common cause of
the Church, or the cōtrouersie and questiō
betwene vs, what Frier Tucke, or Don
Roger doe thinke priuatly, therefore if by
the worde one, ye meane the whole orders
of Friers and Mōkes, and make this
sense, that some orders of Friers put a
great holines in fish, ād some in flesh &c.
Then doe most shamefully and vilie slander
them.

they differ,Nicolaus Gallus in the sibus & hypo. but also in questions of the
law, of the Ghopel, of iustification and
of good workes, as Nicolaus Gallus a
Lutherane protesteth against them.
               Nowe, whether the question of Christes

                  They haue throwē vs into prison,Apolog. into
water, into fyer, and haue embrued
themselues in our bloud, not because we
were either Adulterers, or Robbers, or
Murtherers, but only for that we confessed
the Ghospel of Ihesu Christ, and
put our confidence in the lyuing God.
               
               To speake of the holines and honesty of
your behauiour,Conf. 152 I truste to haue a better

quietly, was W. Flower put to death only

God,
                  Act. and Monuments. pa. 1129. and not for striking and woūding
a Priest, as he was ministring the Sacrament
vnto the people?
               
                  Our purpose here ys not to take in
hand at this present to bring to light and
open to the world,Apolog. those thinges which
were meete rather to be syd and buried
with the workers of them. It be seemeth
neither our Religion, nor our modestye,
nor our shamefastenes.
               
               
                  
Ye lye like hypocrites as ye are:Conf. 154 doe ye
not tarie longer in speaking the worst ye
can of the Catholikes, than in any other
common place of your modest and shamefast
booke? Doe ye not put in writing
most shamefull thinges, either not done
at al, or done so longe a go, that now they
were hid and buried? Doe ye not bring
to Englishmens eares the vnknowē prā
                  kes
of foreners? Doe ye not oft repeate
Diasios and Cassios, as though it stoode
with modestie, to iterat, and exaggerat
such tales? But such is your Religion▪ your
modestie, and your shamefastenes, that it
beseemeth you wel enough.
               
                  Let the Uicar of Christ and the Head
of the Church remember,Apolog. that they be of
his canonists which haue tought y• people
that fornication betwene single folke ys
no synne.
               
               It wilbe harde for him to remember
it,Confut. because he neuer heard it or read it.
And as hard it wil be to heare or reade
that, which was neuer spoken or writen

of a Canoniste, proue ye nowe, that euer
anie Canonist hath taught as you report.
               
                  Iohannesde Magistris, to whom you
refer vs in your margent, can not be
found to haue anie such wordes. Perchance
ye would saie, Martinus de Magistris,
whiche vas no Canoniste, but after
the fasshion of Scholemen, asking the
question whether simple fornication
be a deadly sinne, maketh obiections
first against the truthe, and afterwarde
refelling them, concludeth most expresslie
thus: Simple fornication excludeth
from the kingdome of God: Ergo it
is a mortal sinne.
               
               Now if anie Iohannes de Magistris,
vnknowen yet to the worlde, canne be
brought furth of you to saue your honesty
in so impudent a lye, yet excepte ye can
proue, that he was one of the, Popes own
Canonistes, ye can not but be giltie of

                  ie at the least in this place, which yet
I dare say shal be forgeuē you, if ye cā but
proue, that euer any Canonist hath so cō
                  cluded.
               
                  
Goe to now, and proue your selues true
mē: ād burdē the Popes Canonists with
alowing of that which is expressly condemned
by them.Apolog.
               
               
                  Let him remēber they be of his owne
which haue decreed, y• a Priest ought not
to be put out of his cure for fornication.Confut.
                  
               
               You must brīg him the place, or it is not
possible he shuld find it. for your marginal
note willeth him to seke can. 3. 9. 7. wher
no such thīg is, and the paragraph, Quia,
which speaketh of such only as are not to
be promoted to holy orders, because of
theyr Bygamie. But the trueth is, that
by al Canons old and new,Can. Si quis Ep▪
                   the faulte is
punished. For by the old, were he Bishop,
Priest,Dit. 81▪
                   or Deacō, he was deposed and put
to penaūce: by the later the party offendīg
had tene yeres penaunce inioyned him.
               
                  Let him remēber also,Apolog. how Cardinall
Campegius, Albertus Pighius, & others
many moe of his own, haue taught, that
y• Priest which keepeth a concubine doth
lyue more holily & chastly, then he which
hath a wife in matrimonie.
               
               
                  
If ye were Cardinalles to his holines,Confut.
no doubt ye would do him great seruice,
which being so far out of office, and farre
from Italy, take such care to bring thinges
to his remembrance. But doe not ye
not forget your selues in the meane tyme
by affirming so boldly, so many 
                     •
                  yes? Campegius
ād Pighius do not say that, which
you reporte of them.
               For of two euilles, there is no one the
better, both being euil, but one is lesse euil
than the other. A cōcubine with a priest
is naught, and an open harlot (no mater
though ye cal her his wife) is worse. They
saie not, that to keepe a cōcubine is more
holily and chastely done (as though
any holines were in it at al) neither that
to haue a wife in matrimonie is euill
(as though mariage were not honorable)
but of these two foule faultes, a Priest to
keepe a secrete harlot, which goeth vnd
                     •
                  r
the name and pretense of a necessary
seruaunt, or the same to professe that she
is his yoke felow, and to take the parish to

witnes, that she is his, at bed ād at bord:
the first is euil, the seconde is worse: the
first hath not put al shame asyde, the seconde
is impudent: the first may come of
infirmitie, the seconde wil haue it allowed
by Authoritie.
               
                  I trust he hath not yet forgotten,Apolo▪
                      that
there be many thousandes of harlotes in
Rome, & that him selfe doth gather yerely
of the same harlotes vppon a thyrtie
thousand durkattes by the way of annual
pension: Neither can be forget, howe
him selfe doth maintaine brothel houses,
and by a most fylthie lucre doth fylthylie
and lewdely serue his owne luste.
               
               Speake ye by report of others,Confut. or by experience?
If by report, were they that reported
it, somewhat skilful in the mater
or no? If they were not, but spake also by
reporte, standeth this with your purpose?
and doth this beseeme your Religion,
your modestie, your shame fastnesse,
which ye acknowledge in your
selues, so absolutely to obiecte so greate a
mater, to so great a Bishop, vpō an heare

saie onlie.
               But if they spake of knoweledge, howe
came they by it? Sate they in commission
in Rome it self, and called the harlottes
before them by authoritie? But how were
that either tolerable or reasonable; in a
strange Citie to plaie the Magistrate, or
to labour in the numbring of harlottes?
               Or went they from house to house
with a pryuie serche, making a worthie
occupation for Ghospellers to be curious
in? Or through acquaintaunce with
whores and bawdes, was the whole accompte
without further labour brought
vnto them? They are not to be accepted
for honeste witnesses, whiche are so wel
acquainted, or so muche fauored of those
naughtypackes. Perchaūce as they wēt vp
and doun in the streets, they nūbred certaine
scores of harlottes. There was a
simple eye then I trow, and a deuout purpose
in the marker of such occurrentes.
Yet if it were so, howe gather they, that
manie thousands of harlots are in Rome,

because they obserued manie here and
there to goe in the Citie?
               What so euer shalbe aunswered, it will
be replied, that they them selues are not
far from harlottes, which being no Commissioners
for the purpose, so diligently
obserue such proceedings, and that they
which couete after such knowledge, doe
feede in theyr myndes vppon no better
than carren. And as it maie be seene
by theyr apparell, distincte from honest
women, that Curtesans are in that populous
City, so to beable to say it constantly,
that many thousands of them are therin
placed, it must procede of experiēce, And
it should not be reported in the hearīg of
Christians, excepte it were euidētly declared.
Yea neither thē also, if we rightly
vnderstood our Sauiour sayng:Ioan. 8. 
                  Lethim
which is without syn emōg you cast a
stone first at her. Wherfore this of many
thousād harlots in Rome shal stād for onelie,
ād he which dare come forth ād ꝓue it
in dede, shal stād to defence of his honesti.
               
                  
Now concerning the yearely pension
which the Pope (you saie) gathereth of
them: how great is it? Mary vppon a
thirty thousand duckates. And howe
manie harlotes are there? Manie thousandes
you saie. But I aske how manie?
Make a gheasse as you do vpō the annual
pēsion gathered of them. Are there think
you, thirty thousande harlottes or thereabout?
Nay are ther three or foure thousands
of So many as you would haue seme
to be there? Surely within this number
you can not welcome, because ye affirme
that manie thousandes are there.
               Goe to then, if there can not by your
accompt be lesse than three thousand (for
of two thousand only no man euer sayeth
there are many thousandes) euery one
paieing ten ducketes by the yeare, the
whole pension maie easely be made vp.
And thinke you, that any man disposed
to make a vātage, would gather no more
of such persons, as so lightly come by their
mony? If but three thousand tippling houses

were in anie Citie, a very fauorable
Prince would not make so litle of them
(for excises &c.) as thirty thousand duckates
by the yeare. But if he were a couetous
and greedie Prince, hauing suche a
foule companie in his Citie of whome he
might take large exactions euen for iustice
sake, would he be contented with
an yearely pension of so litle value? So
few thousand duckattes agree not with
so manie thousand harlottes: and therefore
ye shal doe wel to make areuew, and
mend the lye where it is.
               You procede further as it were to a
greater mater: which if it be so, ye make
a third lye, although in deede I suppose,
that it is but the second lye in this place,
set more abrode ād dilated. For he maintayneth
(you saie) brothel houses, &c.
How proue ye that? I think ye wil tel vs
here again of the thirty thousād duckats,
specially because ye speke also of a most fi
                     •
                  
                  thy
lucre, to which duckats we haue āswered
before. And now we say further, that

he taketh no annual vantage of harlotes
at al, but such as commeth from euerie
one that dwelleth in the Citie, by aunciēt
tribut and custome.
               But you saie further, he maintaineth
them (I would ye were so maintained)
But by what meanes? Defendeth h
                     •
                  
theyr cause, as he would the causes of honest
persons? Doth he prouoke them
by immunities and priuileges to tarie? Is
he offended when anie good man either
mercifully doth conuerte them to a better
kinde of lyfe, or iustlie punishe them,
for offending againste the Lawe? Wil ye
see how they be maintained?
               They muste not dwell in haunted or
great places, but in bycorners and lanes.
They must not ryde abrode in coches or
chariotes, but walke a foote in the streates.
They muste not goe in apparell all
lyke other women, but weare a shoorte
vayle of one certaine colour vppon theyr
heades, that they maie be knowen, for
harlottes. And if they lyke strumpets

doe offende against anie of these orders,
they paie a greate forfait.
               Of whiche pointe if ye will gather,
that the Pope serueth therein his owne
lust and lucre: what men are ye so to peruerte
that, for whiche praise is due vnto
him? Shoulde he not punishe them
at all? Or in punishing them, should he
not doe it to the terror and example of
others? Ye will aunswere perchaunce,
that he shoulde haue none suche in the
Citie. Obiecte then onelie that against
him, and slander him no more with procuring
aduantage in maintaininge of
whores, nor defame hym no more that
he seeketh his owne lucre by settinge
greate Forefaites, or trybutes vppon hē.
               And then cōcerning the permitting
of thē in the City,If Canel
                        •
                      ād sinkes becōmendable, thē let M. levvel crie on (as he did in his

                        〈◊〉
                      cause of harlottes. I aunswere you, that in
temporal gouermente it is not euil in respecte
of a worse which els would follow,
to lette harlottes and bawdes * lye with
dishonor ād shame in the sinkes of great

Cities like as Minstrels, Daunsers, Iugglers,
Vsurers, and other of vnhoneste
and vile behauiour of life are suffered to
remaine euen in Lōdon it selfe, and that
when al the Superintendents of Englād
shal be at theyr conuocation.
               And this I speake touching ciuill policie:
for concerning the spiritual gouernement,
there is in Rome daily and vehement
preaching against them.
               In the beginning of Lent, and before
Easter the Pope doth solemly accurse thē.
               Besides this, they shal make no testament
before theyr death, nor afterwards
be buried emong Christians, except they
did repent in tyme of theyr life. How say
you then? Proue not these things in the
iudgemēt of an indifferent man, that the
Pope wil haue no harlots at al in Rome,
if either experience of ciuil policy should
perswade it, or force of his spiritual sword
and sentence, could winne it? And yet
dare you so lewdly to write, that he mainteineth
brothel houses. &c.
               
                  
Of a monasterie, made by the blessed
Pope Pius Quartus charges and charity,
in which the Harlottes conuerted from
their wicked trade of euill life, through
publike preaching or priuate exhorting,
should be receaued and kept in all honestie:
of such a house and maintenaunce
of them to such a life, we haue hearde,
and they which haue ben at Rome, are
certaine. But of any procuring of their
contynuaunce in their filthe and harlotrie,
you haue heard perchaunce, but you
should not haue so stoutly obiected it, before
ye had bene more sure of it.
               Bring furth your Author, that we
may see whether ye be not light of credit,
Or proue your owne sayings true, if
your selues be the Authours, that ye be
not conuicted of impudencie.
               
                  If these things would haue pleased vs
(that is,
                     Apolo. 
                     harlottes, brothel houses. &c)
we needed not to haue departed from
these mens felowship, emōg whom such
enormities be in their chiefe pride and
price.
               
               
                  
I would this were true.Confut, 170. For then no
doubt, but if ye were in company of good
Catholikes, such as be as sorie as you for
enormities, and cōplaine thereof as hartely
as you, though not so vndiscretely: ye
would repent you of your lying and slandering,
and heare Masse with a good wil
and deuotiō, and pray to Saints, and pray
for the soules departed, and obey the B. of
Romes authority▪ Which Bishop, at this
present, is a man so diuine and excellent,
(as appeareth most euidently, by his expelling
of deuils out of possessed bodies, by
expelling the Courtesans out of the City,
by correcting al disorders in the Court of
Rome, by ꝓuidīg for those partes of Christendome,
which either haue no Bishops,
and then he sēdeth them some, as of late
he did into the Indians: or had Bishops,
and enioyed them not, in which case he
hath sent them home to their Countries)
that if in deed, ye had the mīd to returne
to the Catholike Church, ye might neuer
better doe it, than now, when the heade

therof is so wōderful for his holines, fortitude
of mind, vprightnes, and Charitie.
               But ye haue a mad fansie to belye your
selues ād say, that ye had no cause to depart
from vs, if enormities of life wold
haue pleased you: whereas in deede as
lōg as the masse ād the Pope be regarded,
you cannot abide our cōpanie, though the
maners of the Catholikes were neuer so
well amended. Now if ye dare be bolde
with your selues and say, that ye be so persuaded
as ye be not: take hede yet, what
ye report of others, and think not, it is enough
to say it, and neuer to proue it, that
such enormities are with vs, in theyr
chiefe pride and prince.
               
               
                  Paule the fourth not many monethes

                     n, for religions
sake, he racked them, and tormēted them.
               
               The truth is,Con. 171 he caused a Publike Edict
to be made, charging all such as were
gone out of their religion and habite, to

returne againe to their house and Order.
This cōmaundement preuailed with many,
which cōsidering their dissolute liues,
came willingly vnder obedience and order.
Others which passed not for the
Popes commaundement or their former
vowe, being apprehended were put in
prison, that vexation might geue them
vnderstanding, and that disobedience
shoulde not escape vnpunished euen in
their bodyes. As for racking and tormenting
them, that is one: and that many
Bishops were so handled, that is an other:
or that they suffred for religiōs sake
and not for their owne disobedience, that
is a third fowle lye.
               
                  Although we be not ye men we ought
and professe to be,Apolog. yet whosoeuer we be,
compare vs with these men, and euen
our owne life and innocencie will sone
proue vs true, and condemne their malicious
surmises.
               
               Concerning your liues,Con. 127 the greate adoe
which yow make for wiues, proueth
what gift of continencie is emong yow.

And they being in deede no wiues but
concubines, either one synne defended
and mainteined, draweth not an other

                  possible) either els

in the other maters besides incontinency,
ye be not innocent. I reporte me also
to your rayling vpon the Pope, whom ye
knowe not: Your belying of honest men
which yet liue: Your slaundring of whole
orders and companies, either vpō hearesay
only, or for the peculiar faults of some
fewe persons. &c.
               Call ye this innocency? Let the world
iudge, where more disordre of life is,

                  We haue ouerthrowē no kingdom,Apolog. we

               The hundred thousand bandes of Germanie,
which by tumult and vprore armed
themselues against the nobility, and
died al in it, be witnesse against you.
               The Duke of Saxony and Lant graue

of Hesse, he witnesses against you, because
they stoode in field against Charles the
v. whom ye can not denie to haue bene
theyr true Soueraigne and Emperour.
               The Sacramentarie Zuitzers of
Berna, who robbed the Duke of Sauoie
of his townes and Coūtryes from the farder
side of the Lake of Geneua vnto the
Alpes, they shal be brought against you.
               Geneua it selfe, which is neither in
the power of the Duke of Sauoie, nor
vnder theyr lawefull Archebishoppe,
but hath taken all iurisdictions from
them, into her owne handes, maie proue
somewhat against you.
               The Hugonotes of Fraunce, your
brothers, and others in Scotland which
haue and doe yet continue in theyr rebellious
stomakes and enterprises, shal
testifye, that some mans ryghte is decayed
by you. But if you thinke all
these witnesses to be farre of, and that
they can not be well examined, aske
(I praie you) and I thinke ye shall finde,

that the Brothers of Englande haue furthered
the cause of the Hugonotes of
France and Knokes men in Scotland.
               And to be shorte, goe into your owne
bosomes, and consider what compassion
ye haue ouer the afflicted congregation
of the lowe coūtries, where theyr cōspiracies
and enterprises, are so clearlie betraied
and broken. Or consider what ioye
ye haue had in it, when not only against
lawful Authoritie, but also common honestie,
and order, they spoiled Monasteries,
expelled the Religious, threwe
doune Churches, and plaied other suche
parts, as sprites of hel doe sometymes in
greate tempestes.
               
                  The B. of Rome to fede his ambitiō &
greedines of rule,Apolog. hath pulled in peeces ye
Empire of Rome, and vexed and rente
whole Christendome a sunder.
               
               Merciful God,Con. 17
                        •
                     
                   what meane ye? Are ye
offēded, that the empire was placed in
the Weast, to the defence of Christēdom?
And the suppressīg of the Lōbards power
which thē was greuoꝰ to Italy, doth that of

fend you? Charles the greate, so blessed
and valiant a Prince, shal his actes not
onlie be called nowe into question, but
vtterly be condemned through you?
               If you cal this, a pulling of the state in
peeces, that an Emperour was set vp in
the Weast, because the Emperour of the
East was both vnable and vnready to
helpe the Weast church, thē is this present
Emperour with al his predec
                     •
                  ssours gilty
of vniust possessiō ād accessory to the Popes
ambition, as you terme it. For if at
the beginning the title was not good, he
can not with safe conscience abide in it.
And if that were pulling the Empire in
peeces, you perchaunce wil set it together
againe, and helpe to put doune the Emperour
now liuing with al that state, that
ye maie make al ful and perfite, as it was
vnder one Emperour ouer the whole.
               Againe he did not feede his ambition,
being as great in authoritie before as
after. Neither pulled he it in peeces, but
where ther was no whole ād good peece

left, there he placed a perfite state of gouernement.
And it lacked so much that
al Christendome was rent a sondre by it,
that except by that meanes prouision had
ben made for defence of the Church, the
Lombardes euen at those daies and the
Turke sense that tyme, had spoiled and
rent al Chris̄tendome.
               
                  He put Chilpericus the French king
being no cuil prince,Apolog. beside his realme,
only bycause he fansied him not, & wrōgfully
placed Pipine in his rome.
               
               Chilperike was so good a Prince,Confut. that
He was commōly called stupidus, a dolt.
He was also wholy geuen to belly chere,
ād loue of womē. And therfore the whole
realme of Fraunce made ernest sute to
the Pope, that they might be loosed from
theyr othe made vnto him: wherby it appereth,
that the Pope folowed not an only
fansy of hys own, but the requeste and
aduise of a whole Countrie.
               Now as for placing of Pipine wrongfully,
I knowe not how they could make it

probable, except he were made kinge
against the good willes of the nobility, ād
communaltie of Fraunce. For whereas
euery common wealth is greater thā the
Prince which gouerneth it, and maie
depose the same vppon lawfull cause, and
whereas ryot and doltishnes are causes
sufficient so to does (as making the prince
vnable to gouerne it wel) it foloweth cō
                  sequētly,
that if the whole state of Fraūce
deposed Chilperike and erected Pipine,
ther was not fault cōmittedin so doying.
               
                  He vtterly destroyed the state of the
most florishing Citie and commō wealth
of Florence,Apolog. his owne natiue countrie.
               
               How great words, vtterly destroied,

quiet, thā it is now vnder the Duke. For

confessed theyr mistaking of him (which
had bene a token of good natures, and
such as especially should be in the professours
of an holy Ghospel) yet in theyr seconde
Edition and further deliberation
vppon the mater, they not only doe not
reuoke theyr slaunder, but make Argumentes
to defende it.
               And firste, to that whiche Hosius
mighte truelie saie vnto them, that
they doe hym wronge, and that the
woordes whiche they obiecte againste
hym, are not hys owne woordes,
but the woordes of the Heretike
Zwenkefeldius: they aunswere.
               
                  But howe then,Apolog. In the second edition. if Zwenkefeldius
make Exclamations on the other syde
and saye, that the same verie woordes
are not hys, but Hosius owne wordes?Confut.
                  
               
               If he will be so shamelesse, as to obiecte
that vnto Hosius, as Hosius owne,
for whiche Hosius expressely reproueth
him: Or if he wil be so folish as to professe

that opinion, whiche he wil put await
from himself, when he is chalenged of it,
he is a meete witnes for the Apologie.
But howe is it likely and probable, that
Zwēkefeldius might so doe? It foloweth.
               
                  For tel me,Apolog. where hath Zwenkfeldius
euer writen them.
               
               What if so much be not tolde you,Confut. will
it folowe, that because you knowe not,
where to finde them in Zwengelfeldius,
therefore they are not in him at all? Or
because it is not told you wher Zwēkfeldius
hath writē thē, therfore Hosius doth
alow them? For herein is the pointe,
whether Hosius aloweth them for his
owne wordes, or no.
               
                  Or if he haue writē thē,Apolog. & Hosius haue
iudged the same to be wicked, why hath
not Hosius spokē so much as one word
to confute them?
               
               By like reason you might make S. Augustine
a greate heretike, because in 
                     〈◊〉
                  
booke ad Quoduultdeum, he 
                     〈◊〉
                  
shortlye the heresies that were in 
                     〈◊〉
                  
world, and doth not also confute them 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
he telleth them. But the cause of Hosius
fact is euident, for that his principal purpose
in that place, was to shew the heretikes
procedinges, and not to tary about
the confuting of theyr sayinges. And
whereas he compteth Zwenkfeldius an
vptars̄t heretike for those foresayd wordes,
is it not manifest, that he him selfe
hath no lyking of those woordes? Verelie
although Hosius in noting Zwenkfeldius
for those wordes, hath not straitewaies
aunswered his argumentes: yet he sufficiently
proueth himself to be of a contrarie
opinion, and thereby aunswereth your
fonde obiection, by whiche your would
seeme to make Hosius a Zwenkefeldian,
in that he iudged Zwenkfeldius wordes
to be wicked, and yet spake not so much
as one worde to confute them. As
though it were not to speake some word
at the least against a position, to saie no
more but this of it, that it is an heresie.
But see what foloweth in the Apologie.
               
                  Howe so euer the matter goeth,Apolog. allthough

Hosius peraduenture wyll not
allowe those wordes, yet he doth not disalow
the meaning of the wordes.
               
               This,Confut. 
                  howe so euer the matter goeth,
of which you speake, hath this sense
in it, that there is no remedie, but you
must, one way or other, make Hosius to
be a Zuenckefeldian, least you should
seeme to recant and reuoke that, which
most vniustly and blindly ye haue layed
vnto his charge.
               And therefore, whereas it is most
manifest, that Hosius aloweth not those
heretical wordes, which he attributeth
vnto Zuenkefeldius, and whereas ye
can neuer purge your selues of the slaunder
made vppon him in that behalfe: ye
depart from the matter, neither prouing
sufficiently your obiecton, neither confessing
honestly that you haue mistaken
him, but leauing it with a peraduenture
Hosius wyll not allowe those
wordes, ye procede to proue, that how
so euer the matter goeth, Hosius disaloweth

alloweth not the meanynge of those
wordes.
               
               In which poynt, ye discharge not
you
                     •
                   honesties, but shew partly your fond
inuention, in burdening your Adueruersarie
with the sense of those wordes,
the speaking or writing of which, ye can
not proue against him, his open fact and
denial standing to the contrarie: partly
your wretched disposition, in mainteyning
a lye by impudencie, as though neuer
to confesse your fault, were the next
way to be deliuered. I adde further,
that ye be lesse sure of Hosius meaning,
than of his speaking or writing. For
wordes and letters are sensible, but the
meaning without some externall signe

                     •
                  ade, is not intelligible.
               If therefore you will leaue to presse
Hosius with the foresaied wordes, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  peraduenture he will disallowe

                        〈◊〉
                     
                   should ye not much more haue

                     〈◊〉
                   your selues, from laying the 
                     〈◊〉
                  
of them vnto his charge?
               
                  
Except you be so folish, as to thinke, that
he wil not put awaie from him the sense
of those words, the very forme of which
ye ghesse he wil disalowe.
               But let vs see further how substantially
ye wil proue Hosius to be of this mind
that the Scriptures are to be reiected.
It foloweth.
               
                  For wel nere in all controuersies.
                  Apolog.
               
               Your slaunder is to general:Confut. come to some
special poynt or other.
               
                  And namely touching the vse of the
holy communion vnder both kindes:Apolo. although
the wordes of Christ be playne
and euident, yet doth Dosius disdainefully
reiecte them, as no better thā cold
and deade Elements.
               
               What meane ye by, disdainfully reiect
them?
                  Confut. Doth he scrape them out of his
boke? Doth he cal thē, not worth a straw,
as Luther calleth S. Ioannes epistle stramineam,
a strawen epistle? Doth he say
that they are crepte into the text out of
the margen,Beza ia Anno. in Luc. 22. as Beza reporteth (like a
blindebuzzarde) the wordes of S. Lukes

Ghospel, which shal be shed for you, to
haue ben infarced? What hath Hosius don
to the texte of the Scripture, that ye
shoud so lowdly obiecte it, that he doeth
disdainefully reiecte them? Bringe
in your arguments, that they may be considered:
And shew vs some euidence, that
ye seeme not to light and slaunderous of
your tongue.
               There is no doubt, but Hosius and you,
will not agree vppon the sense of many
textes: but concerning the wordes them
selues of the Ghospel, Hosius can not possibly
reiecte them, being a Catholike. For
in such cases he can doe nothing of him
self, but must folow the Catholike church.
And the Catholike Churche is so religious
towardes Scripture, that as she
hath receiued it, so she mainteineth and
keepeth it still.
               Note therefore this place (gentle
Reader) and marke whether the Authours
of the Apologie, haue either the
habilitie to proue that, by which they

haue defamed a right Catholike and Reuerend
Bishoppe: Or the humilitie and
honestie, to confesse theyr fault, and to
aske forgeauenes for theyr obiecting of
that which they are not hable to proue.

though he sel for mony Bishopriks, Monasteries,
Priesthod, Spiritual promotions,

because he cōpteth al his own, he c

commit simonie though he would neuer
so fame.
               
               How proue ye, that the Canonistes,Confut. 259. of
this day, haue such a conclusiō as you speke
of? The author of Summa angelica, or
Theodoricus, whom ye name in the margen,
for the profe of this mater, are dead
many daies agoe, and serue not to proue,
that the Canonists of this day now liuīg,
haue this or that opinion. Therfore I wil
be so bolde as to charge you with one lye
in accusing the Canonistes of this day.
               
               An other lye shal be, that you slaūder

them, to speake (what soeuer they be of
whom ye meane) for their belies sake. For
(God knoweth) al the lawiers which you
euer haue seene or had to do withal, fare
litle the better for the Popes table.
               The thirde lie, (and that moste notable)
is, that ye make them to conclude
it absolutely and generallie of the Popes
prerogatiue, which they meane but in a
certaine case, and one certaine respecte
onlie. For, the distinction and determination
of this question, by the verie
Summam Angelicam it selfe is, that
concerninge suche punishementes and
paines, as are sette vppon Symonie by
the positiue Law, the Pope is not subiect
vnto them. But for the other thinges,
which are Symoniacal, and punishable by
the Law of God: In ijs quae sunt Symoniaca

be true, who then maintaineth the
Hebrue Readers of the old testament in

selling of Bibles, Hebrue, Greek and Latin

that God him selfe is like to fare the

assemblies and conferences of Bishops
and learned men, neither haue we done
that we haue done, altogeather without
Bishopes, or without Councel. The mater
hath ben treated in open Parleamēt,
with long consultation, and before a notable
Synode and Connocation.
               
               Yeas,Con. 275. altogether without Bishops and
without a Councel. For in that notable
Parleament, the first of our Soueraigne
Lady that now is Quene (in which that
was don for you that was done) ye could
haue no Bishops in the plurall number to
stand for you: because ye had not so much
as one in the Singular number.
               
                  Albeit afterward in dede one ye had, and
he being deceaued or ouercummed did
beare with the procedinges more proprely,
then support them.
               This is one. Now, as for the treating
of the matter in open Parleament, it
was so open, that your voices had no place
in it. This is an other.
               Thirdly, concerning the long consultation
that was vsed, the Parleament
began after Christmas, and without any
greate arguing to or fro, the maydenbill
(as it was called) of the Princes Supremacie
was readye to haue passed aboute
the beginning of Lent. Then stode one
vp that spake against it, with such libertie
that he was examined vpon it, and
lost his owne libertie 30. dayes together,
and with such truth and grauitie, that
for so many daies after, the matter also
of the Supremacie was suppressed. Yet
about Easter, for the worde head, came
in the word Gouernour. And so was
the Supremacye admitted, when the

Parleament so little thought of such a
fetch, that an earnest fa
                     •
                  orer of the Gospel
toke indignation at it, and saied, that
if men were ashamed of the word it self
head, they should also refuse the Supremacie
it selfe which was imported by it.
And cal you this a long consultation? This
is a third.
               Last of all touching the notable Synod
and cōuocation, it put vp to the Parleamēt
an expresse bil of informatiō against
your procedinges. So far of it was from
helping you. This is the fourth greate
lye, in this one little sentence of yours.
               From which fowre, if ye wil defende
your selues, by referring your meaning,
not to the first Parleament of the first
yeare of Quene Elizabeth (in which ye
were Sirs out of office) but vnto the other
that folowed (the Catholike Bishops
now being safely kept in prison) then as

which none of you were p̄sent, though the
Parleament folowing, had ben open the
cōsultation long, the cōuocation notable
(albeit this might be proued to be an
open, longe and notable lye) yet note, I
praie you, the folie and lie which in this
sentence goe togeather. For your maters
being don to your hands, in the first Parleament,
where no place was made for
you: it is a verie lye to saie: We haue
not done, that we haue done, altogeather
without Bishoppes. And the
first Parleament seruing your purpose so
fullie, that ye needed not an other, what
wisedome was it to haue a longe consultation
and notable Synode vppon
that; whiche was before concluded for
you, and by you was not to be remoued,
for all your notable conuocation?

ye may be perdoned, for not knowing the
historie of our Realme: which if you will
take the leasure to consider, will teache
you, that the taxes or Peterpence of
which you speake (or els ye must perdone
me, if I vnderstand you not) were so frely
geuen by Kinge Ihon to the Popes for
euermore: that excepte his conscience
had moued him vnto it, there was no
force of armes, nor will in the Pope, to
make him of necessitie to doe it.
               And because you make it a faulte as
it were general of all Popes, that needes
they will haue taxes of you: remember

if Popes were the men, as you make thē
to be. Wherby it appeareth, that although
ye might freely make lyes vpon the Ambition
and couetis
                     •
                   of Popes in olde time:
yet these Popes which of late haue in
dede bene so much able, and yet through
charitie so litle willing to take of you, do
in all mens eyes and iudgments, conuince
you of lying and slaunderous tonges.
               
                  Men folowing God his bidding,Apolog. of
theyr owne free wil resorted vnto y• doctrine
of Iesus Christ.
               
               As for example,Con. 345 in our owne countrie:
In King Harry the viij. dayes, who
so would not haue abandoned the Authoritie
of the Bishop of Rome, should be

hanged, drawen, and quartered. To haue
but the name of a Pope in a matins boke
was treason, permitting men to praye to
S. Gregory which was a moste holy Pope,
and punishing thē for hauing that name
Pope stāding by him in their kalēder &c.
               In king Edwarde his tyme, the procedinges
increasing, it was punishable to
heare Masse, &c. And at this present, it is
so odious and dangerous, not to come vnto
your Ghospel, that your selues prouoking
the Catholikes to answer you▪ or alowing
the bragging manlynes of such a challenger:
yet now when answers are prouided
for you, ye stoppe by all feare that ye can
make, first that none be brought in, and
afterwards that none be readē, vpō paine
of the cōmissioners dispeasure. And, were
not the iudgement of our Princesse greater,
than to suffer suche an absurditie,
as that you shoulde prouoke and crake,
when none is willing to fight, and when
the enemie is comming forwarde, then
call vppon the temporall Arme to driue

him backe, that you might triumphe in
your maner without the victory, surely
had not the goodnes of our Princesse misliked
this cowardnes, ye had by this tyme
made it death, to haue any booke of the
Papistes making in Louane. And call
you this, Men of theyr owne wil to resorte
to your doctrine?
               
               
                  And for our parts truly we haue sought
hereby neither glory,Apolog. nor wealth, norpleasure,
nor ease: for ther is plentie of al these
thinges with our aduersaries.
               
               It is harde to truste you,Con. 34
                        •
                     . especiallie
whee as this nedelesse sayīg (that you haue
not sought for glory) proueth that you are
content to be thought to haue the contempte
of glorie: which is but a base and
sory argument of humilitie. As for your
desire of wealth, although Luther, the
mā reised of God, had not for couetise preached
against pardons, and if Peter Martir
(chaynging his opinion with whiche
he came to Oxforth, and from his Lutheranisme
turnīg himself to Zuinglianisme

for loue of so sweete a liuing did not make
it probable (as he sayed vnto Iulius his
man after a greate feast made to him in
Oxford, O Iuli, bonum est nos hîc esse,
O Iuly, it is good being here) And although
your miserable misery and banishment
in which you were at Geneua, that
in condition the popish Religion might
be displaced, you woulde be content to
conforme your selues to the Princes Religion
and orders, which (in the article
of supremacie) Caluin your master coulde
not abide, And although your selling of
stone, lead, slat &c. your woodsales, your
bying of Copyholds, your begging of mony
and wheat toward household, your breeding
of swyne with the ouer sight of the
Superintendent himself in that kinde of
cattell: although (I say) all these matters
might make it not vncredible, that you
had the desire of wealth in your pouerty,
which be so greedie thereof yet dayly stil
in your plentie: yet because in these foresayd
poyntes the fault may be layed not

vpon religion, but on the persons professing
it, I shall therefore bid you consider
one principall end and conclusion of your
Gospell, to see thereby whether ye seeke
not for ease and pleasure, or (if your selues
be better disposed) whether the course
of your Religion doth not drawe men to
that affection.
               For running out of Cloysters, breaking
the vowes of pouertie, of obedience,
of chastitie, no rising at midnight, short
prayer, contempt of prescribed fastings,
yoking of Priestes and their women togeather
&c. and such an Apprehension
of Christes merites by Faith, as maketh
the handes to let goe all meddling with
good workes &c. these being the effects
of your religion, and part of the greatest
poyntes of your profession: let it now be
iudged, whether these men saie true or
no, in glorying that they seke not ease and
pleasure, except you will say, ye be not
inclined after the wayes of your owne
religion.

                  We can not away in our Churches
with the shewes,Apolog. and sales, and byeing,
and selling of Masses.
               
               AS who shoulde saie,Con. 111. we your Aduersaries
doe abide it. No verelie,
we no more alowe the
sellinge of Masses, than the Inceste of
the renegate Friers and Sisters: And yet
there haue ben in the Catholike Church
Religiouse personnes so fowlie disposed.
As doeth appeare by the chiefe Apostles
of the new Ghospell, Luther, Oecolampadius,
Peter Martir, Bale, Barc
                  
                     •

Barlowe, Scorie &c. Which departed
out of the Churche on theyr owne
heade and perill, and liued not well in
the Churche whyles they were interteined
in it. And so, although some faithlesse
and wretched fellowes, might be
proued to haue sold theyr Masses in the

Churche: that conuinceth them to be
naught, and not that the Churche consenteth
vnto it.
               
                  We verelye,Apolog. because we knowe the
shedding of Christe hys Bloud vppon
the Crosse to be the onelie Sacrifice, are
well content with it alone, and looke
for none other. And forasmuche as yt
was to be offered but once, we commaūd
it not to be renewed againe.
               
               You woulde (I perceaue) haue the
Catholikes compted exceading couetous
and insatiable,Conf. 123. as thoughe they shoulde
thinke the shedding of Christe his Bloud
vppon the Crosse to be vnsufficiente to
saluation.
               But yet howe thinke you? Notwithstanding
ye are so well content,
(as ye saye) with Christe his Passion
alone: doe ye not thinke it necessarie
for you, to obey the Churche, to obey your
Prince, to absteine from lying, from adultery,
from Simonie &c? If besides the
passion of Christ, you must also keepe the

Commaundementes, and doe as manie
good workes as ye may, then as you are
content, so are we: And you are no wiser
(by this rekening) than other poore
folkes are.
               But, if Christ his Passion doth so
content you, that ye seeke not to suffer
also with him, after your degree, in
a certaine proportion: then doth it plainlie
appeare, that you are quickly satisfied.
And in such sorte to be well content,
is for suche as neuer thincke to
ascend after Christ, and are verie vnlike
vnto him.
               
                  Why hath he hys Legates (as much
to saie as moste suttle spyes) lying in
wayte in all Kinges Courtes,Apolog. Councelles
and priuie chambres? Why doth
he, when he lyst, sette Christian Princes
one against an other, And, at his owne
pleasure, trouble the whole world with
debate and discord?
               
               First,Con. 178 let it be proued, that the Pope
doth it, and then afterwardes aske the
cause why? And cōsider also, whether it

becommeth the Church of England, that
such an Apologie should goe furth in the
name of it, as meddleth with the legats,
whom other Princes of Christendome
doe interteyne? And which obiecteth to
a person of much Authoritie, at the least,
such an heyg
                     •
                  nous and shamefull crime,
as, that at his plesure he should trouble
the whole world. If the Pope were no
more quiet and peaceable, than ye make
him: had England all this while continued
in schisme and heresie, and not ben
made a praye to some that would haue
taken it?

Pope Clements stirope, he was not suffered
so to doe, the Popes modestie ouer cō

                  Why doe they hyde,Apolog. why doe they
keepe vnder, the Ghospell, which Christ
woulde haue preached alowde from the

               We beleue,Con. 222. it is not hyddē, that which
is openlie readen in the Churche, Catholikelie
expounded in Vniuersities,
Ordinarelie readen in Religiouse houses,
And commonlie solde in Hebrue, Greeke,

This lye is dilated by the Authours of
the Apologie. Fo. 264. this also is emong

                  Why doe they not proue theyr Religion,Apolog.

Churche, and by the Fathers, and Councels
of old tymes?

this is a lye.

if you can bring anie such chapiter furth,
ye shal make it lykely ād ꝓbable, that we
are to blame for not putting it in. And,
if you can not, you proue your selfe to be
verie suspitiouse and slaunderouse, which
reproue the Catholikes, for not putting
that in, which is not, as farre as we or
you doe hitherto know, to be found in any
place extant. Yet you haue suche a grace,
as in speaking, so also in reading without

no aunswer, because the Catholik Church

euerie gentleman controllers busie
questions, although it be able, either by
expresse Authoritie, or els by necessarie
consequence to declare good and sufficiēt
cause and reason for euery thing that
it aloweth. But touching this present question,
Socrates Hist. Tripart. lib. 4. ca. 9.

doth plainely testifie against you.
               
                  What one error haue they amended?
From what kind of Idolatry haue they
reclaimed the people?Apolog.
                  
               
               Here is a suspiciō reised of more thā one
error,Con. 291. ād of more thā one kind of Idolatry
to be in the church, and ther is no ꝓbatiō
annexed to ꝓue that which is sayd. But
herein your blīdnes ād ignorāce, doth vtter
it self, that ye know not what is truth,
ād right worshippīg of God, which obiect
errors ād Idolatry to th'church of God, in
which church the techer of truth th'holy
Ghost,Ioan. 14
                        •
                     
                   is alwaies presidēt, and shal be vnto
the worlds end.
               Again, if you cōsider, what hath ben don
of late in general coūcels, ād what is don
daily both by p̄ching, ād writing against
euil life and heresy, you can not iustly find
fault with the heades of the Churche, as
though they had no regard what the
people did beleue and folowe.
               Then further I say, if you willo biect
ignorance vnto the Catholykes that,

they knowe not what is true Religion:
then doth it remaine, that you tel your
owne mindes, and answer theyr Confutations
and Replies. Before which tyme
to insulte vpon them and to crowe out a
lowde, from what kinde of Idolatrie
haue they reclaimed the people? is, to
triumphe before the victorie, and to goe
merelie awaie with the sentence, whiles
the mater is a hearing yet in the consistorie.
               But if you obiecte this crime to the
Catholikes, that they knowe wel inough
what Idolatrie is, and see the kindes of
it, and yet reclaime the people from
no kind thereof: this trulie is so heighnous
and so vile a fault, that ye shoulde
haue euidentlie proued it, before ye had
so artificiallie concluded it.
               For a plaine answere to whiche fowle
suspition, let any reasonable mā be iudge,
whether it be lykelie and possible, that
they which with great paines and daunger
of bodie, haue prouided, verie Idolatours

in deede, to be conuerted vnto our
faith, would wittingly suffer an Idolatry
to be at home before theyr eies, ād yet not
take a litle paine to opē theyr mouth but
once against it. The Frāciscans, and they
of the societie of Ihesu, haue and d
                     •
                  e take
exceding greate paines about the barbarous
people in the East and Weast India,
and with hazard of theyr temporal lyfe,
they venter to bring the Infidels, to the
knowledge of the life euerlasting. Therefore
surely it is bysides al reason and likelyhod,
that of so manie of the same order
and profession, as liue here in Europe emong
vs, no one should be foūd so honest,
so hardy, or so faithful, as to reclaime the
people from theyr Idolatrie, if anie were
in them at all.
               
                  Why doe they so vncourteously or with
such spite,Apolog. leaue Princes out, & as though
they were not either Christen mē, or els
could not iudge, will not haue thē made
acquainted with the cause of Christian
Religion, nor vnderstand the State of
theyr owne Churches?
               
               
                  And why doe you so openly and so licentiously

                     •
                  uer
it is to be kept. Theyr Legats haue honorable

Cou

                  cel house, that they may not be ignorant
of that which is done, in debating
and examining the cause of religiō: They
be humbly and hartly thanked, for theyr
helpes and assistance and presence, made
in the cause of the Churche: They be sent
home with peace: And say you, that princes
are so lefte out, as though they
were no Christen men, whose Embassadours
you maie vnderstand to be interteyned
and vsed so honourably?
               
                  What ys the Pope,Apolog. I praie you, at
this daye, other than A Monarche, Or
A Prince? Or what be the Cardinals,
who must be none other nowe, but princes
and Kinges Sonnes?
               
               We neuer hearde anie wyse man callCon. 299
                  
the Pope A Monarche. But a Prince he
is in deede, either as the worde Prince
maie signifie the Chiefe in all Priestelie
function, either as it signifieth a man so
indued with Temporalties, that he maie
worthely be a Kinges felow.
               But saie you, what other is he than
a Monarche, or a Prince? As who
shoulde thinke, that he sate imperiallie
vnder his clothe of Estate, and hearde
Embassadours out of all quarters of the
world, and gaue kingdomes or toke them
awaie at his pleasure, and after such maters
of weight dispatched, then that he
went to hunting, hauking, plaieing, daū
                  sing,
feasting, &c. as worldely Princes
doe. For such a thing do the cōmō people
imagine a Monarche or prince to be, one
that ruleth al, and liueth in al pleasure.
               That you therfore may be corrected of
your lie, ād the simple Reader of his error,
I say that the Pope is no Monarche at al.
And I confesse boldly, that he is a Prince,
by reason of the Temporall, and greate

Iurisdictiō which he hath ouer S. Peters
patrimonies, but as Pius the fifthe that
now liueth, did answer agreably to his holines,
and wisdom, Licet Princeps sum,
antiquius tamen Pastoris quàm principis
nomen agnosco: so (to say the like in
English) I geue you to vnderstand, that
although the Pope be a prince, yet he
acknowledgeth and taketh, the office
of a Pastor to be the more former and
principal with him, than the Office of
a Prince.
               By this office then of a pastour, he gouerneth,
and f
                     •
                  deth his flocke: he sendeth
non residents, home to theyr cure: he apointeth
out Preachers and Bishopes for
the new found lands: he calleth Coūcels,
endeth Coūcels whē it shal please him he
goeth in visitatiō (as this last yere he did
through althe parish churches of Rome)
he excommunicateth such as wil not repent
(as he doth Courtesanes, expelling
them bodyly also out of the Citie) he succoureth
such as wil conuerte (for which

purpose, his predecessor Pius the fourth of
blessed memorie, built a peculiar Cloister
or house) he preacheth vnto his flocke,
(as he did thrise the last yere, first in S.
Peters Churche, after that in our Ladie
Churche, which is called Maria Maior,
thyrdly in S. Iohn Laterane) he ministreth
the Sacramentes, he confirmeth
Bishopes, he bindeth, he looseth, he chargeth,
he dispenseth, and by vertue of his
Authoritie and Priestehoode, he expelleth
the dyuels themselues out of the possessed
bodies.
               Nowe if Princes and Monarches haue
the Office and power to doe these spirituall
functions, whiche I haue short
                     •
                  lie
and in parte noted: then shall they also
be holie Fathers, and take vnto them
the title of Supreamehead vnder God
in earth. But if no man be so foolishe as
to holde it, that a Prince is a Priest: then
are you answered, that the Pope at this
daie is some other thinge than a Monarche
or a prince. And so we praie

you to be content, and not to sue vnto vs
for aunswer of that, whiche is in plaine
sight, so euident against al truthe.
               As for Cardinalles, who (you say)
must be none other now but Princes
and kinges sonnes doe ye thinke, that of
Princes and Kinges Sonnes, one maie
loke for no other thīg, but wildnes youthfulnes
and ignorance? Cardinal Pole,
the Cardinall of Loreine, Hercules
Gonzaga, Gaspar Contarenus, Fregosius:
Nauagerus These I trow (if any be)
are the 
                     •
                  ardinalls whom you wil nūber
emong the Sonnes of kinges and princes.
And what thinke you of them, or what
shal ye find in them? Shal ye not find euerie
one of them more notable and famous
for theyr learning and vertue, thā
for theyr familie and Parentage?
               If ye thinke then, that the Princes
Sonnes that are made Cardinalles, are
nothing els but vnlerned Courteours,
you shall shewe your selues to be verie
simple Scholars, whiche canne iudge

no better of the foresaied Cardinalles.
On the other side, if ye confesse them
to haue bene, and yet to be men verie
wyse and learned: then maie ye mistruste
your wittes and iudgement, in
obiectinge that, as an Infamie to the
See of Rome, that the Noble men
whiche th
                     •
                  re are Cardinalles, are Princes
Sonnes. Whereas the same be greate
Diuines also and Doctours.
               But it greiueth you, that Cardinalles
muste be none other now, but
Princes and Kinges Sonnes. There
is no muste in the mater: For the pooreste
of you all, if his pouertie consisted
in byrthe onelie, and not in witte and
honestie, he might be not onlie a Cardidinall,
but also A Pope. Lyke as of
Adrianus the sixthe, we not onelie
reade, that he was borne at 
                     •
                  ltreicht
                     •
                  ,
of verie poore Father and Mother: but
also we heare of the Auncient in Louane,
that he liued here by begging very
much at the beginning.
               
                  But ye affecte not to be Popes: Cardinals
perchaunce ye could lyke to be, if
that letted it not, that Cardinals must
be none other now, but princes and
kings Sōnes. As who should say, that no
man knoweth, that Hosius, Seripando,
Amulio, Sirlettus, and he de ara Coeli
in Rome, are Cardinals by authority, and
meane mens Sonnes by natiuitie.
               But to conclude, it appeareth that you
are very base borne childerne, whiche
so beggarlie and ignorantly talke of maters
out of your knowledge, and woulde
seeme to haue no litle intelligence of the
state of the court of Rome, of which ye so
speke as pedlars, that make discourses in
Alehouses of Reformation in Religion,
and war or peace betwen Princes, ād not
as graue men, whiche shoulde be sure
firste of that whiche they saie, especiallie
when they speake in the name (as it
were) of A whole Realme or Countrie.
            
            
               
               The 9. Chapiter, Of an impudent and
desperate maner of lying, which
may well be called, facing
of a Lye.
               
                  As for those thinges which by them
haue bene layed against vs,Apolog. in parte they
be manifestly false and condemned so by
theyr owne iudgementes whych spake
them.
               
               SHewe,Con. 10. where, when, and by whom.
               
                  If they perchaunce will not see that,Apolog.
which they see in deede, but rather will
withstand the knowen truth.
                  
               
               You doe well to adde (perchaunce)
and yet you be to suspicious without very
good argument,Conf. 19. to thinke that anie
Catholike will withstand the knowen
truth.
               
               
                  Lorde God thou knowest,Apolo. that our
Aduersaries were the verie foes to the
Gospel, and enemies to Christes crosse:
who so wittingly & willingly did obstiuately
despise Gods commaundements.
               
               
                  In this you haue done politikely,Con. 151. to
appeale to the knowledge of God, with
Lord God thou knowest. For in the
iudgement of men, which knowe not
what is within an others breast, except
it be vttered by some external signe, it
is impossible, that you should with any
reason obiect it vnto vs: that wittingly
and willingly and obstinately we despise
Gods commaundements, hauing
no word or writing of ours, by which ye
are hable to shew it. And if you haue
any, let that rather be brought foorth,
than a naked slaunder onely exhibited,
without any confirmation or likelyhode.
               
                  Our enemies doe see,Apolog. and can not denie,
but we euer in all our wordes and
writings haue diligently put the people
in mynde of their duetie, to obeie their
Princes and Magistrates, yea though
they be wicked.
               
               If we can not denie it,
                  Conf. 175. howe is it,
that we doe denie it? Yea rather howe
could we denie that, which is to be sene

so openly? Are you only straungers in
the affaires of the newe Ghospel, and doe
ye not knowe, howe it hath proceded hytherto?
               Tel me, I pray you, whose counsell the
Duke of Saxonie and the Lantgraue of
Hesse did followe, when they stoode in
Armes against theyr laufull Emperour
Charles the fifth?
               Of what Ghospell was Luther, when
he wrote, that the Emperour and Catholike
Princes were proditores scelesti,
vanique nebulones, traitours, wicked
men and vaine knaues?
               How came the Caluinists by Geneua, a
denne nowe of the Gospellers, and vnto
what Prince should it be subiect, if right
and consciēce could preuaile emōg them?
               By whom was Pultrone chosen vnto
that ministery, to kyl the Duke of Guise,
the chief Captaine of the French King?
Was not Beza the preacher, one of them
that promoted him to that office?

                  not, those thinges which they bost they
haue &c. and though they haue a desire
rather to dissemble: yet they them selues
are not ignorant thereof, yea & somtime
also they let not to confesse it opēly.
               
               See,Con. 252. how deuoutly these felowes can
make lies. They talke with God about
the matter, and they comfort themselues
with this (I trow) that he yet is their
witnes, that we haue not Antiquitie,
Vniuersalitie and Consent, which we
say we haue. And it foloweth, that we
our selues are not ignorant hereof, but
the proof hereof (as I suppose) is to be referred
to the knouledge of the good Lord
only. For cōcerning the knowledge of mē,
wheras it is manifest by al our doings and
writings, that we haue those three thīgs
for vs, Antiquitie, Vniuersalitie, Consent,
and that against al our aduersaries
we proue, that these three be so with vs
that they are not with them: it is vnreasonably
and impudently set furth in
print, where he that will may iudge of

it, that we should be of any other minde,
than can be proued by euidence of some
externall signes.
               
                  We are come to that Church,Apolog. wherin
they themselues can not denie (if they
will say truely, and as thei think in their
owne conscience) but all thinges be
gouerned purely and reuerently, and as
much as we possibly could, very nere to
the order vsed in the olde tyme.
               
               Here againe our owne conscience is
brought furth against vs,Conf. 269 as though thei
did see by their sprite, what we thinke
in wardly: though we outwardly shew
all signes to the contrary. Many Catholikes
liue out of their Countrie, other
many lye in prison within their Country,
some write whole bookes against the procedings,
And al (I thinke) doe speake
against them, when they may do it without
daunger of displeasure. What should
we doe more, to declare that the newe
Gospel is damnable? Yet al this notwithstanding
we thinke in our conscience
(say the Authors of the Apology) that al

thinges be gouerned purely and reuerently
emong them &c. Haue they any
honesty, which set such faces vpō maters?
               
                  Let vs see in al that while (of the first
syxe moneths in which the Councel sate
at Trente) of so many,Apolog. so manifest, so often
confessed of them, and so euident errors,
what one errorhaue they amended?
               
               But what are they first,Con. 291. that we may
knowe them?
               
                  These men vse of course,Apolog. to denie all
thinges, be they neuer so cleere: yea, the
very same, which they presently see and
beholde with theyr owne eyes.
               
               This lye is of the same sute with his
foresaied felowes,Conf. 317. because it layeth such
thinges to our charge, as our doeinges
proue to be most false and incredible. For,
al the Scriptures we haue receiued, and
excepte we had commended them, no
protestant could euer haue trusted them.
The old Councels and Fathers we more
esteme than Protestantes doe, we refuse
no laufull testimonie of any age. That
which we see with our eyes we do neuer

deny, though we vnderstand such thinges
as come vnder our senses, otherwise
than the heretikes doe.
               To whom therefore may I compare
these Aduersaries, which wil make vs
beleue, that we see well inough that,
which we do deny, and sometimes denie
that, which we do see. I thinke they are
disposed only to make sporte, ād so to plaie
in maters of religion, like as idel spēders
of theyr wit and time doe, in the deuising
of mad mery games. For when halfe
a dosen such are agreed togeather, one of
them (for example) laieth handes vpon a
quiet man that passeth by: And whyle
the innocent looketh backe vpon him, in
commeth an other that helpeth to holde
him, so fast, as though it should be for the
kings auantage, to haue such a one made
sure. With that, he that without cause is
so apprehended, wondreth at the matter
ād asketh what they meane ād stretcheth
his power to break away frō them. But he
begīneth no soner to resist, but straitwaies

they cry, helpe Sirs, helpe for the Lordes
sake, this felow is mad: see how his colour
chaungeth, see how he panteth &c. And
with that, the rest of the brotherhoode
sore moued with bitter compassion, make
in to him, and for lacke of other sprites,
there they possesse him, and holde him,
and crie vnto him, and kepe such a sturre
about him, as is able to bring many a man
halfe out of his wittes, and to perswade
with other that stande by and consider
the thing, that vndoutedly the felow that
suffreth the violence is mad, and not that
they, which goe so sadly and constantly to
the holding of him, should be any thing
madde.
               After which sorte if the Authors of
the Apologie haue concluded to cry out
vpon vs, that we can not denie, that,
we knowe in our owne conscience,
that, we knowe for a truth, such and
such thinges as we lay against them, to
be false, and if they will needes enforce
it vpon vs, that we can not deny, but

all thinges are gouerned purely and
reuerently amonge them, what remedy
but patiēce, and to suffer them to cary
vs into Bedlem with so many holy and
learned men our forefathers, as already
they haue condemned, if they will not
be answered with our open confession in
worde and deede? But if this be vnreasonably
done of them, to burden vs with
such a Conscience as can not be gathered
of any our external acte: Iudge thou Indifferent
Reader, whether this be not
properly facing of a lye.
            
            
               The 10. Chapiter, conteining the Problematicall
or Hypotheticall lyes,
with, how then, what ifs, and put
case. Not so impudent and open faced
as other, but not vnworthy to be
noted, and no lesse shameful than the
worst of all.
               
                  But, I put case,Apolog. an Idoll be set vp in
the Church of God. And the same desolation,
which Christ prophesied to come,

stand openly in the holy place.
               
               It should not long continue,Con. 192. I beleue,
to graunt your case. For whē Antichrist
him selfe shal come, he shal be quickelie
destroied, and neuer haue any successour
openlie to syt in his Chaire after him.
               
                  What if some theefe or Pirate inuade
and possesse Noes Arke?Apolog.
                  
               
               I thinke the Arke woulde sinke.Conf. 192 And
whereas God him self keepeth the Arke
his Church, and prouideth it to be a place
of safety in which the iuste seed shall be
preserued: to let a Pirate and Theefe to
possesse the Arke, were as muche to
graunt, as to lette there be no honestie,
no Faith, no laufull Authoritie in
the Church: Yea it is as much to saie, as,
I put the case there were no God.
               
                  Howe then if I call furthe those for
witnesses,Apolo. whom them selues haue vsed
to honour? What if I saie, that Adriane
the Bishop of Rome did frākly confesse,
that all those myscheefes braste out first
fr
                        ••
                      the hygh throne of the Pope?

                        •
                     06 if ye saie so.
               
                  
                     But howe then yf Zwenkeseldius
make exclamation on the other syde,Apolog. and

                        〈◊〉
                     , that the same verie wordes be not

                        〈◊〉
                     , but Hosius owne wordes.
               
               If he will be so wise as to recall his
owne woordes,Con. 217 the Churche is mercifull
to al that repent. If he wil be so desperat,
as to denie that which is in sighte: that
shal helpe him nothing in theyr iudgmēt,
which knowe Hosius to be a Catholike.
               
                  But howe if the thinges which these
men are so desyrous to haue seeme new,Apolog.
be founde of greateste Antiquitie? Contrariwyse,
howe if all thinges well nie,
whiche they so greately sette out with
the name of Antiquitie, hauing bene
well & throughly examined, be at length
founde to be but newe and deuised of
verie late?
               
               Verely they wil be strange cases,Con. 230. when
any suche fall.
               
                  But I put case these Abbates and Bishops
haue no knowledge?Apolog. What if they
vnderstād nothing what religion is, nor
howe we ought to thinke of God? I
put case the pronouncing and ministring

of the lawe be decayed in Priestes, and
good counsell faile in the Elders, as the
Prophete Micheas saieth, the nyght to
be vnto them in stede of a vision, and the
darkenesse in stede of prophēsiyng? Or,
as Esaias saieth, what if all the watchmen
of the Citie are become blinde?
               
               What if y• salt haue lost his propre strēgth
and sauerines? And, as Christ sayeth, be
good for no vse, scant worth the casting
on the dunghill?
               The lesse knowledge you would make
the bishops and Abbats to haue,Con. 280. the more
miracle it wil be, that without knowledge
they haue such learning, as their
bookes, and preachings, and doinges doe
testifie. Take for an example the Catholike
Bishops of England. Is there among
them all any one against whom you may
come with your textes of Micheas, Esaias,
or Christ our Sauiour? Yet, you put
the case they haue no knowledge: I aunswere,
that your case is a verie hard one.
But yet to remedie somewhat this matter,
if our Bisshops should be so vnlearned

and ignorant, I thinke it were better
for the common wealth to set them
to Schole, than to put them in prison. Or
if they be nothing mete for lernīg, to set
them rather at libertie, being suche as
can hurte the procedinges nothing for
lacke of good life and knowledge, than to
kepe them in, so preciselie and politikely,
as though euerie worde that they should
speake, were able to cōfound an heretik.
               
                  Howe then if the Pope haue seene
none of these thinges,Apolog. and haue neuer
reade either the Scriptures, or the old
Fathers, or yet his owne Councels?
               
               I aunswer▪ but first,Con. 284 I will also put a
case. What if there were no shame in a
man? What if there were no regarde of
the sight of God? What if in all thinges
he should seeke for this onlie, howe to fill
the peoples eares, and to make them gather
of an exceading greate word somewhat
at the least? W
                     ••
                  ld there be anie
discretion or staie in suche a one of putting
cases, of deniyng moste manifeste

truthes, of slaundering worthie persons,
and goeyng against sense and reason? So
is it with the Authours of the Apologie.
For, how thē
                   (say they) if the Pope haue
neuer readen, either the scriptures, or
the old fathers, or yet his owne Coū
                     cels?
How then? Are ye not ashamed to
put such a case, as neither euer yet happened,
nor euer is like to come to passe by
any reason? Shew the occasion of this your
suspition and feare? Declare your selfe to
be of greater experience and consideration
than those are, which quake for feare
where no cause is? Name anie one Pope
that hath not bene so learned, that you
might welthink him to haue readen the
Scriptures? Ye can name none at al. You
put only a case with, how then if he hath
neuer readen the Scriptures? And I
aunswer, that if it be so, it is a great miracle.
And that except you bring furth
some certificate of it, it is not to be beleued.
But neither you meant it (I suppose)
to affirme it: only ye thought it enoughe,

to speake much, as thoughe you
could bring furth somwhat, And to leaue
it to your Reader to suspect somwhat, although
you proued nothing.
               I confesse vnto you: I can not tel what
to saye to such What thens? and What
yfs? But if you haue any arte in iudging
of them: I pray you, if the skye should
fal, were not many larkes like to be taken?
And if such kindes of What yfs?
as you haue put, might be folowed in other
examples: were not manie fooles
like to be made and preferred by it, and
many Wyll Sommers would they not be
found in England, which would quickly
saie: what if all the Councell be
vnlearned? And what if poore knaues
haue as great a gift of wisedome, and
knowledge, as the Noble and
Learned of the world?
Thus far concerning
this matter.
            
            
               
               The 11. Chapiter, confuting a blasphemous
Lye.
               BY manie smal practises, at length an
habite is goten, and he that refrayneth
not his tongue, and thought in
the lesse, shal make it so fond and slipperie,
that it will offende in the greater:
And the Apologie of England whyles it
toke not good heede inough, to speake
trulie of men, it is come to that blind audacitie,
that it belieth God him selfe. For
this cause therefore, that the Authours
thereof maie the better consider of theyr
rashnes, and the Indifferent Reader may
the more plainelie see, that he muste not
truste euerie Sprite: I place this lie by it
selfe as a singular one, without felowes
and without cōparison, and I call it as it
deserueth, a Blasphemous lye For thus
they saie in defence of theyr discession
from the Catholike Church.
               
                  Though we haue departed from that
Church whiche these men cal Catholike,Apolog.
                     
& by that meanes get vs enuy amongst
them, that want skyl to iudge: yet thys
is inough for vs, & it ought to be inough
for euerie wyse and good man, and one
that maketh accompt of euerlasting life,
that we haue gone from that Churche,
which had power to erre, which Christ,
who can not erre, told so long before, it
should erre.
               
               Where find ye this in anie Ghospel?Con. 322 Or
why tel ye not your Reader of it, that he
also might perceaue it? Or why directe
ye him not to the place, at the leaste,
where he might seeke it? Can it be any
other than wicked impudencie, to make
Christ saie that which he neuer saied?
If Christ hath fore
                     •
                  old it in deede, that
our Churche shoulde erre, shewe vs that,
and there is nothing to be replied. Fathers,
Councels, Stories, Apologies, Replies,
Reioynders, al other labours maie
be spared: onelie that place were to be
shewed, where Christ hath so plainly cō
                  founded
vs. For this you maie be sure, if
ye can proue that our Church maie erre,

you shal perswade al the sort of vs, to forsake
it, and get vs to an other of whiche
we maie be sure it can not erre.
               But forasmuch as ye can bring furthe
no such word of Christ: why make ye such
a wretched crake, as though ye were departed
from a church that may erre to a
better congregation, or as though Christ
should beare witnes vnto the goodnes of
your doeynges by his foretelling, that our
Churche should erre?
               Here ye are to be pressed, ād here should
ye be enforced to aunswer. For by this
place it will quickely be seen, who hath
wōne, or who hath lost. For if it were S.
Ambrose, or S. Augustin that did affirme
anie thing, the Catholike would so farre
accepte it, as he should see other Fathers
to agree to it: and the heretike woulde
so litle make of it, that if all the fathers
bysides did saie with them, he woulde
not be bound to folow theyr authority, because
they al were mē. But if Christ once
saie the word, both partes wil submitte

thēselues vnto it, because it is impossible
that he should speake anie vntrueth.
               His authoritie therefore being, for so
good cause, so great with vs: either ye can
ꝓue that Christ hath fortold as ye report
of him, or ye can not proue it. If ye can
not, what an impudencie is it againste
Christ himself, so to belie him, and what
an iniurie 
                     •
                  s it to the Reader, so to abuse
him by the name of Christe? But if ye
can shewe it, where Christ hath foretold,
that our Churche shoulde erre: doe so
then, and speake not so mightie woordes
againste vs, without anie prouing
of them at all.
               But, howe is it possible, that ye should
proue them.Christ hath a Church. For this first ye will not
denie, that Christ hath a Church: otherwise
his Incarnation and Passion hath
bene in vaine, if he haue not her, for whō
he toke flesh,The Churc

                      visible. ād shed his blud. This church
thē of Christ, is it visible, or no? Visible it
must nedes be, because it cōsisteth of mē,

                     •
                  nd mē are creatures cōsisting not of pure

and simple soules, but of soules and bodies
togeather. And Christ saieth of it,Math 5. 
                  The
Citie can not be hid that is set vpon
an hyl.
               
               Being then visible,The Churche hath order in it Sap. 11. shal ye see good order
in it, or no? Vndoubtedlie he that
hath made al things by nūber, weight,
and measure, muste not let that to be
without order, which he estemeth most
of al other thinges. For 
                     〈◊〉
                   is the bodie of
Christe,Eph. 4. compacted and knit togeather
through euerie ioynt, wherewith one
ministreth to an other, hauīg in it distinction
of offices, and duties, to rule, to
obey, to preache, to heare, to minister, to
receaue.
               This Order then,The order in the Church must continue. Dan. 7. shal it for anie tyme
be lacking in Christes Church, or shal it
continue to the worldes end? It muste
needes continue, because the kingdome
of Christ is euerlasting, and no power is
hable to destroie the order which he taketh.
The Apostle also most expresly telling
vs, that Christ hath geuen Apostles,

Prophetes, Euangelistes, Pastoures and
Teachers,
                     
                        •
                     ph. 4. to finish and perfite the holy, to
worke in the ministery, to build vp the
bodie of Christ. Which bodie whereas it
cā not be perfited, vntill al they be borne
that shalbe saued soules: it foloweth, that
this Order which I speake of, must continue
so long vntil all meete togeather
in vnity of faith and knowledge of the
Sonne of God, which wil not be, til al
be borne that shall so meete togeather,
and that is at domes day, and not before.
               These grounds then so standing, I say
vnto you: for as much as the Church of
Christ consisteth of a visible cumpanie
of men, which is kept in order and vnitie,
by reason that euery one knoweth
his place and keepeth himselfe within
his boundes least he loose his place: and
for as much as this cumpanie and order
must continue to the worldes end without
dissolution or distruction: I say therfore
vnto you, that either our Catholike
Church is the true Church of Christ, or

els that Christ hath no Church at al. For
besides our Church ther is none that hath
bensene to cōtinue in any form of religiō
euer sensth' Apostles time hitherto. As
in exāple, before Luther brake out frō his
cloister and Rule, ther was not in al the
world anyone cūpany, of Luther ās, Zuīgli
ās Caluinists, or any other sect, that braggeth
at this day of the light ād knouledge
of the gospel. Wel ther might be in corners
some faithles mē and womē, that in hart
were heretical (like as at this present if
harts were sene, many shuld be foūd euē
in Englād it self, to dout of th'īmortality of
the soule, ād th' Incarnatiō of Christ, &c)
but ther was no opē cōgregatiō of thē, nor
apꝓued form of ministratiō emōg thē, nor
any face or shew of a Church. For yourselues
do say, that Martin Luther, ād Hulderik
Zuīglius wer the first that came
to the knowledge ād preaching of the
Gospel, so that if they were first. it foloweth
that before they came, ther was no
congregatiō of ꝓtestāts in al the world, or

if it were, it was not visible, or if it were
visible, it had no true preachers, or if it
had true preachers, Luther, ād Zuinglꝰ
need not to be praised of you, for most excellēt
mē euē sent of God to geue light
to the world, because there were in the
cōgregatiōs of the sincere in the Lord, as
illumined preachers of the word, as they.
But wher as the truth is, as you say, that
Luther, and Zuīglius were the first that
cam to the knoulege ād prechīg of the
Gospel (which is none in dede) and wher
as it remaineth to this day, not ōly in the
bokes that are writē, but in the memories
of mē that knew those daies, that before
Luther and Zuīglius made a tumult in
Religiō, ther was not in al Christēdō any
other ꝓfessiō of faith, thā was sene in our
Church which we know to be Catholik: it
foloweth that your church cā not possibly
be the Church of Christ, the cōtinuāce of
which your church cā so litle be ꝑceiued,
that yourselues know, it begā to com furth
in Frier Luther and Sir Zuīglius time.
               
                  In whiche Churche there was so little
order, that ye can name neither Superintendēt,
nor minister, nor preacher, nor
bro
                     •
                  her of it that liued before the most
excellēt mē Luther and Zuinglius: and
which Churche was so inuisible, that ye
neuer sawe so much as any forme of communion
table pulpit, vestiment, or other
thing vsed in it.
               Yet, we see this by experience, that
when a cumpany of heretikes doth mete
togeather, they wil not be longe without
theyr preacher (euerie one is so readie to
be preacher) and they can not be without
some place, and they wil make harde
shifte but they will haue a good place:
which is the cause, that so many requestes
haue bene made to Gouernours of
certaine Countries, and so manie Religious
houses and Churches haue bene
hewed and squared for the receiuing of
the newe Ghospel.
               Therefore if there was anie congregation
extant of this your Church, before

Frier Luther lay with Nonne Katerine
and begate manie foule and filt hic opinions
of his owne braine: and if that
Church was the true Apostolik Church,
and had so continued from the beginning:
thē had they places to resort vnto,
and they vsed such order, as they had receiued
of theyr Forefathers, and you are
hable to name the place and tel vs theyr
Order.
               But we can he are of no such thing: ergo
there was no Church of yours at all as
then. Add then now vnto this, that Luthers
Church began with Luther, and
so furth euery Church sens Luther hath
begon with the Diuiser of it: And consider,
that the true Church of Christe can
haue no suche discontinuance or interruption,
as that it shoulde be saied after
manie hundred yeares comming in betwene,
in which one forme of Religion
was vsed: now is Luther or Zuinglius
sent of God to geaue lyght vnto the
world: Gather, I saie these thinges together,

and ye shal perceiue, that either
Christ had no church hūdred of yeres together,
and that yet he hath none: or els
that our Catholike Church is the one and
only church of Christ. For alother Churches
haue either discōtinued, either they
haue not bene sensiblie perceiued, either
they haue ben within memorie erected,
and so they lacke Succession, visiblenes,
Antiquitie.
               Of whiche three pointes, the Church
that Luther and Zuinglius went vnto,
when they departed from the Catholikes,
had not one. But afterwardes when
they became them selues builders of A
new Church, ād that vpon theyrown heades
and Authoritie (for they acknowledged
no creature then liuing for theyr superiour
in that mater) thē in dede, it was
not long but they gote one of the forsaied
three pointes. For they kepte such a sore
sturre against all Christendome, that it
was most euidēt, that they were a visible
Congregation. But as for succession, and

antiquitie, they can neuer get it, because
they can neuer proue it: for why, they neuer
had it. Yet for Antiquitie they wil
striue, and crake (as the Authours of the
Apologie doe) that they doe come as
neere as they possiblye can, to the
Church of the Apostles and of the old
Fathers. But in the point of Succession,
they can not tell, what to aunswer for
them selues.
               For how,Let the heretiks shevv their succession. thinke they is it possible, that
the Church of Christ should be without
the lauful successiō of the Apostles? Could
his wisdom not for see it, that for as much
as he minded cōtinually to cal in gheasts
vnto his feast: therefore it was necessary
to prouide seruants, one after another,
for that purpose? Would his chartie suffer
it, that togeather with the Apostles
deathes his cōpassion vpō the poore soules
of the world, shuld die, ād that ther shuld
not be for euery age vnto the worlds end,
like officers (for their authority) as th' Apostles
wer, to dispēse his graces ād mercies?

Could not his power perfourme it, that
come who would, none shoulde be hable
to staie the succession of his Lieutenants
and Vicars?
               What then can the heretike nowe say,
why he hath not a succession? A thing so
necessary for the wisedome of God to prouide,
and so natural for his Charitie, to
geaue, and so proper, for his almightines
to maintain. Verely were it not, that he is
almightie, it is impossible by naturall power
and reason, that the Bishop of Rome,
whom heretikes haue alwaies hated, at
whom the greatest Bishopes in the East
Churche haue enuied, with whō Lordes
ād Ladies of the world haue ben so much
offended, whom the Barbarous haue so
ofte assaulted, whom the Christians at
home haue so trobled: that he yet, should
continue still, and alwaies haue a successour,
it passeth al cūpasse of mans wisdom
and prouisiō, but that he that made him
his Vicar in earth, is God almightie in

                     •
                  eauen and earth.
               
                  In some other thinges the heretikes
maie so contend with the Catholikes,
that it will be hard for the indifferent
man certainlie to knowe whom he maie
folowe. They wil alleage the same letter
of the Scriptures as the Catholikes doe,
they wil vse the same coūcels, ād fathers,
They wil challenge Antiquitie, and say
that they haue descended from the Apostles
(like as Parking Warbecke saied he
came of king Edward the fourths bloud,
and what so easie as to saie a worde, if
one will be desperate, and die rather in
field than vnsaie it) but when they are
brought to the mater of succession, in
which they lacke the verie bare names,
and much more the Actes and Monumentes
of such as they should shewe to
haue descēded lineally and orderly from
the Apostles, doune vnto them: then
loe they are at a staie, and haue not one
wise worde left to them, by which they
might aunswer a question so principall
and so reasonable.
               
                  And yet they crake stil that they are
come to the Churche of the Apostles,
and of the old Catholike Bishops and
Fathers, whiche Churche (saie they
with exceding blindnes or impudencie)
we know hath hithervnto ben sound
and perfite,
                  Con. 322. 
                  and (as Tertullian termeth
it) a pure Virgine spotted as yet
with no Idolatrie, nor with any foule
or shamefull faulte. Note (Gentle
Reader) that they speake of theyr knowledge,
and excepte theyr knowledge be
so diuine and ineffable, that neither
we can conceaue it, nor they well vtter
it: desire thē to be so good, as to make vs
also knowe it.
               For if they knowe the Apostolike
Churche, to be hythervnto sounde,
perfite, and pure: lette them tell vs
where it was in the yeare of our Lorde
1500. or, 1400. or, 1300. The Churche
of Rome is knowen, to haue stoode in
those yeares: but all the sorte of them
holde it for A Principle, that manie

errours and faultes were founde then
in it. Ergo if (by theyr saieing) that
Church had errours: what other Church
was there, in those dayes whiche they
knowe to haue bene sound, perfite, and
pure? They can reken none at all. For al
these Weast partes of Christendome folowed
the Church of Rome: and they thē
                  selues
confesse, that the Greeke Churche
doeth erre. Ergo, if the Churche of
Rome was not sounde, and perfite, in
those foresaied yeares, and if the Greeke
Churche be notorious for the errours
of it: howe doe these Felowes knowe,
that the Apostolike Church hath hithervnto
bene sound and perfite?
               
               For what signifieth hithervnto, but
euen vnto our time? And if the Apostolike
Church hath ben found and perfite
euen vnto our time: there was suche a
Churche vndoubtedlie in the yeares of
our Lorde 1500. 1400. and 1300. and that
Churche was not (as they holde) the
Churche of Rome: Ergo some other.

But there was no other that they knowe
to haue ben sound, perfite, and pure:
Ergo they speake more then they know,
and ioyne thēselues close to the Apostolike
Church without any succession from
the Apostles, and crake of a pure ād perfite
building without anie foundation.
Such is theyr miserable and blind braggyng.
               How much more trulie should ye conclude,
that for as much as the Apostolike
Churche not onely hath bene hytherto
sound ād pure in doctrin, but must also
cōtinue sound and pure vnto the world
end: and for as much as no Church hath
cōtinued so, but only the church of Rome,
therfore he that maketh accompt of euerlasting
life, can not possibly attaine vnto
it, excepte he come to that Churche, in
which only the succession continueth, by
which it is easie to ascend vp euen to the
chiefe of the Apostles. For to S. Peter
our Sauiour saieth:Math. 1

To S. Peter then as the singularly chosen
the promises are made, and the priuileges
are by praier obtained, ād the charge
by expresse worde is committed.
               Nowe, for confirmation of these
wordes, consider the effectes that haue
folowed, what heresie was euer mainteined
by the See of Rome? What question
was there euer in the Church of Christ,
and not referred to that See, and determined
or pacified by it? What See hath
continued in al tempestes, but onlie the
See of Rome? Who can shewe theyr
succession from the Apostles, but onlie
the Bishopes of Rome? What See is preferred
in the writinges of holy Fathers,
but the See of Rome onlie? That is the

Chaire, vnto which perfidiousnes can
haue no accesse,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   That is the chaire of
vnitie, in which God hath put the doctrine
of veritie,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   
                  That is the Chaire, in
which euill men are constrayned to
speake good thinges, that the faith of
the Christians may be out of doubt with
them, whiles it shall depend vpon the
infallible promises of God, and not vpon
the deceiptful coniectures of men.
               This Churche therefore being the
Church which we cal Catholik, in which
the chiefe Master of the worke laied S.
Peter as the first stone next to himselfe,
and in which there is a continual rew of
Bishops one vpon an other to the meruelous
strengthning and beautifieng of the
whole building, against which Church
it is impossible, that any wind or weather
should so preuaile, as it might ouerturne
it (for it is builded vpon a sure Rocke) in
