In this doctrine be cōprehended melancolynes and heuines / whiche greatly hurte the body: for by their operation the body waxeth lene and colde / the hatte ſhrynkethe vp / the wytte and vnderſtandynge cometh dulle / the reaſon troubled / & the memorie vtterly marred. Yet neuertheleſſe / it is very expedient for fatte and corſye folke to be ſome tyme penſyue and heuy / that there by they may moderate the ranke

heate of their ſpiritis / and make their bodies leaner and more ſklender. The ſeconde doctrine is / to eſchewe anger. For anger in lyke maner drieth vp the body / and exceſſiuely chaffeth & inflameth the membres. And to greatte heate (as writethe Auicen in the firſte diſt. and fyrſte chap. of the .iij. doctrine) drieth vp mans body. Secondly anger hurtethe by the heate and inflāmation of mans harte / and lettethe alſo the operations of reaſon. Some there be that naturally / or by ſickenes / or chance of poyſon / are colde: for ſuche folke to be angrye is verye neceſſary for their bodily helthe / that their naturall hete by ſuche meanes may be ſtered vp / gotten / and kepte. The thirde doctrine is to eate and drynke ſobrely: for eatynge & drynkȳge exceſſiuely cauſeth vs to be vnluſty / drouſy / & ſlouthfull / hurtynge & infeblynge the ſtomake. Many other inconuenientiſes (as ſaith Auicen in the chap. of wyne and water) groweth and chanceth throughe exceſſe of meates and drynkes / as here after ſhall be declared. The .iiij. doctrine is / to make a lyght ſouper. For to moche meate takē at nyght cauſeth and ingendreth gnawynge and payne in the bealye / vnquietnes / let of naturall reſt / and other grefes / whiche we fele and ſe by experiēce: the whiche here after ſhalbe more playnlye declaredde. The .v. doctrine is to walke after meate. For therby the meate diſcēdeth to the bottum of the ſtomake / where (as Auicen ſayth) reſtethe the vertue of digeſtion. For the mouthe of the ſtomake deſireth foode / and maketh digeſtiō.

The .vj. doctrine is to eſchewe ſlepe incōtinent after meate / whiche cauſeth helthe and auoideth diuers infirmities / as hit is after ſhewed in theſe verſes: Febris / pigrities &c. The .vij. doctrine is to make water as ofte as nedethe: For who that kepeth or holdethe his water longer than nature requirethe / ſhall auoide it with great peyne: and ſo hit may chance that dethe ſhall folowe / as Auicen ſaith in his .xix. diſt. li.iij. and chaptre of the difficulte of makynge of water. Alſo to kepe the dregges and ſuperfluite of mans foode longer thā nature requireth / ingendreth many incōuenientiſes in the body. For the liuer and veynes called meſeraikes / drie vp (for the moſte parte) the humors of the forſayd ſuperfluite / and ſo made hard / can nat be auoided: and thus cauſethe opilations in the guttis and ventoſites / and (ſo it may chance) impoſtumes: as after ſhall be ſhewed. The .viij. doctrine is / that one doynge his eaſement and auoydyng ordeurs and filth of the body / ſhuld nat moche inforce and conſtrayne his fundement: for ſo doinge the emerardes & fiſtule ſhal greue hym / and the fundemēt many tymes is myſordred and thruſt out of his propre & naturall place. Finally thauctor ſaythe / that who ſo wyll obſerue the forſayde doctrines / ſhall lyue longe in good helthe and proſperite.
            
               Si tibi defitiunt medici / medici tibi fiant
               Hec tria. mens leta / requies / moderata dieta.
            
            Here thauctor gyuethe .iij. generall remedies to conſerue in helth al creatures / and ſpecially noble

men. The firſte is to lyue ioyfullye: for ioye and myrthe cauſeth man to be yonge and luſtye. By moderate ioy and myrthe youth is conſerued / naturall vertue cōforted / the witte ſharped / & therby man is more prompt / quicke / and of abilite to do all good and honeſt operation. Nor it is nat ſayde without a cauſe that our ioy and myrthe muſte be moderate. For whan it is without meaſure / it ingendreth dethe bothe bodilye and gooſtlye. This moderate ioy is mooſte conuenient for them that haue moche care and trouble. Whiche ioy may begotte by the vſe of delicate meates and drynkes / by auoidynge of ſuche thynges as ingendre melancoly. And alſo (as Auicen ſayth in his .xj. boke & chap. of faylynge of mans harte) by dwellynge and accompanyng amonge our frendes. The .ij. remedy is trāquillite of mynde / of vnderſtādyng / and of thoughte. For noble men throughe theyr great buſynes and charges / are moche more greued & troubled thā other meane perſones. Great care of mynde and vnderſtandyng diſtroyeth the natural reſt of man / moſt expedient for noble mē / whiche moſte cōmonly are naturally drye and colerike: for whom reſt is ryght profitable and conuenient. The .iij. remedy is moderate diete / that is to eate and drynke moderately. And after ſhall be declared what inconueniences growe through exceſſe of meates and drynkes.

            Here are declared .vj. doctrines / whiche conforte mans brayne & the other membres of the bodye. The fyrſt is whan we ryſe in the mornynge yarly to waſſhe our eies with clere colde water. The eies wolde be waſſhed to clēſe away the ordure and fylthynes that hange in the bries of them. And Auicen ſaythe in the .xiij. diſt. of his .iij. boke / and chap. of conſeruacion of the eies / that the ſouerāſt thyng to mundifie and clenſe / and to make ſharpe of ſyght the eies / is to open them / for the eies. and ſo to put & plunge them in clere water. And agayne he ſayth in the .iij. diſt. and chaptre of feble ſyghte / that to bathe and plunge the eies in clere water / & therin to open them / cōforteth and concerueth the ſight / and ſpecially of yonge folke. The reaſon why the eies muſte be clenſed with colde water / is bycauſe euerye thynge muſte be conſerued by that that is lyke hit. For Galen in his .iij. boke de reg. ſaythe / that hotte bodies haue nede of hotte medicins / & colde bodies colde medicins: Conſiderynge than that mans eies be colde of nature: hit ſtandethe with reaſō / they ſhulde be waſhed with colde water & nat with hotte. The .ij. doctrine is to waſhe our handes whan we be vp in the mornynge / for they be intrumentes ordeyned to kepe & to mundifie the membres / by the whiche the ſuꝑfluites of the brayne be expulſed and auoided / as by the noſtrils / the eies / the eares / and other naturall conditis. And therfore the hādes ſpecially oughte

to be waſhed with colde water / for the waſhynge of the handes with hotte water engendreth wormes in the bealy: and ſpecially to waſhe them in hotte water incontinent after meate / as Auicen ſaythe in the .xvj. diſt. of his .iij. boke / the .v. treatice / the chap. of wormes. For the waſſhynge of handes in hotte water incontinent after meate / draweth the inwarde and naturall heate of man to the exterior partis / and ſo the digeſtion is vnꝑfet: the whiche vnꝑfet digeſtion is the principall cauſe that wormes be engendred. The thirde doctrine is to rome a lytell hither and thyther whan we are ryſen from reſte / that ſo the ſuperfluites of the ſtomake / guttes / & lyuer (as the groſſe matter of the vrine) may ye ſpediler be thruſte vnder. The .iiij. doctrine is competently after reſte to extende and ſtretche out our handes / fete / and other lymmes / that the lyfely ſpiritis may come to the exterior partis of the bodye / and ſo cauſe the ſpiritis of the brayne to be more quicke and ſubtile. The .v. doctrine is to combe our heed in the mornynge / to open the pores of the heed / to auoide ſuche vapours as yet by ſlepe were nat conſumed: and alſo to quickē the ſpiritis of the brayne. Farther more to combe the heed is very holſome / and ſpecially for aged mē. And Auicen ſaith in the .iij. diſt. of his .iiij. boke / and chap. of feble ſight / that to cōbe the heed is holſome / ſpecially for olde men. Therfore one ſhulde dayly & ofte combe his heed. For ofte combyng draweth vp the vapours to the ſuperior partis / and ſo ſeperateth them from the

eies. The .vj. doctrine is to waſhe and purge the tethe. For the filthynes of the tethe cauſethe the brethe to ſtynke. And of the filthynes of the tethe growethe certeyne vapours / that greatly anoye the brayne. Farther more the filthynes of ye tethe myngled with thy meate / cauſethe the meate to putrifie in the ſtomake. Auicen in his .vij. diſt. of the .iij. boke and chap. of cōſeruacion of the tethe / for the tethe. teacheth how we may kepe the tethe from ache & ſtynche. That is to waſhe the mouthe with wyne twyſe a moneth: but to make the brethe ſwete / it muſte be boyled with the roote of ſpurge. Who ſo euer vſethe the forſayde decoction & medicine ſhall neuer haue the tothe ache. In the laſte verſe are certeine generall rules: The firſt is that after we haue waſhed and bathed our ſelfe / we muſte kepe vs warme: For than the cunditis of the bodye / that is the pores / bene open: wherby colde wyll perce in to the bodye / and ingendre in vs diuers diſeaſes. The .ij. is / that after we haue dyned or taken our repaſt / we muſte for a whyle ſtande vp ryghte / that ſo the meate may diſcende to the bottum of the ſtomake / and thā walke a litel ſoftely: for haſty mouynge driueth naturall hete from the interior partes to the outwarde / and cauſeth il digeſtion. The .iij. is / that one of colde complexion ſhulde nat warme hym ſelfe to ſodaynly / but lytell and lytell. for ſodayne change hurteth nature: as Galen ſayth in the glo
                  •
               e of this canon: Secundum multum et repente &c. All ſtronge thynges and of extreme nature corrupt the body.
            
               
               Sit breuis aut nullus tibi ſomnus meridianus.
               Febris / pigrities / capitis dolor / at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   catarrus
               Hec tibi proueniunt ex ſomno meridiano.
            
            Here are declared .iiij. incōuenientices engēdred by after none ſlepe. Fyrſt the after none ſlepe cauſeth and ingēdreth feuers by reaſon of opilatiōs. For the naturall hete and ſpirite of man by daye draweth to the outwarde partes of the body: and therfore digeſtion by day is but feble: But whan naturall heate and ſpiritis of mā drawe to the inwarde partis of the bodye: than throughe theyr motion naturall heate is ſtered vp: and therfore the nyght is the very ſeaſon of perfite digeſtion: and the vndigeſted & rawe humours are ye cauſe of opilations / whiche opilations engēdre feuers / as Auicen ſaythe in the .j. diſt. li.iiij. and chap. of putrifaction. Secondly after none ſlepe cauſethe man to be ſlouthfull in his operations & buſines / by the reaſon afore ſayde / for groſſe humours and vndigeſted cauſe mans ſpiritis ſlowelye to moue the bodye: For as a ſubtile quicke ſpirite cauſeth lyghtnes of body / ſo a lumpiſhe ſpirite cauſeth a ſluggiſhe boby.cauſe of heed ache. Thyrdly / the after none ſlepe engēdreth heed ache: For the groſſe and vndigeſted meate that remayneth in the ſtomake lyfte vp to the brayne groſſe vapours / whiche trouble hit. And of very cōſequens / if vapours of gros mattier be ſtered vp & cauſed / they muſt alſo be gros. For Galen ſaythe in the gloſe of this aphoriſme: qui creſcunt &c. that hit muſte nedes folowe / that all thynges be lyke thoſe thynges / of whom they be

engendred. The .iiij. incōuenience is the poſe and reume. Reumes be humours that rounne from one membre to an other / and as they rounne in diuers partis of the bodye / ſo they haue diuers names. For whan the reume cometh to the lightes / they be called catarri: and whan they diſcende to the chekes / they be called branchus: and whan they come to the noſe / they are called corizam: as appereth by theſe verſes:
            
               Si fluit ad pectus / dicatur reuma catarrus / 
               Ad fauces branchus / ad nares dico corizam.
            
            But beſides the reaſōs of the diſeaſes before reherſed / there be many other reaſons / and more effectuell. The cauſe of the firſt incōueniēce / that is of feuers / whiche ſome tyme are called putrified feuers / and ſome tyme feuers effimeres. A feuer effimere is engēdred of vapours and ſmudge fumes kept and reteined after the after noone ſlepe / the whiche abſteynynge from ſlepe is wont to cō
               ſume. The forſaide ſmudge fumes mixyng them ſelfe with mans ſpiritis engendre an vnordinate and a ſtrāge feuer called effimere. The putrified feuer is ingengdred of the humidites in man vndigeſted / and augmēted by the after noone ſlepe. The .ij. inconuenience that is to be ſlowe in operation and motions / chanceth by reaſon that by the after noone ſlepe the humidites and fumes in mā are reteined about ye muſkyls / veynes / & iointis / and cauſeth the forſayde membres to be aſtonyed and a ſlepe: and therfore the bodye after dyner is ſlowe and heuy in operations. The thyrde inconuenience

(that is the heed age) cometh / as is before declared in the .ij. incōueniēce: that is to ſay / by the humidites & vapours reteined in the body throughe ſlepe and reſt: whiche by ſuche meanes are troubled and moued towarde the brayne / and ſo cauſe the heed age. The .iiij. inconuenience is (that is the catarr̄) ſignyfyenge al maner of reumes / chanceth to man and vexeth hym / through vapours and fumes / whiche are wonte to be diſſolued & cōſumed by watche / by ſlepe they drawe to the inwarde partis of mā / and fume vpwarde towarde the brayne: whiche fumes ingroſſed by colde / retourne to the lowe partis caterriſans of mans bodye. Auicen in the .xiii. diſt. li.j. in the .ij. doctrine and .ix. chap. allegeth many other inconueniencis & diſeaſes engendred of the after noone ſlepe. The firſte diſeaſe is the goute and palſey. Whiche greue vs / by reaſon that the humidites / that are wonte to be dried vp and cōſumed by the heate of the ſonne / and by watche remayne ſtyll in the body. The ſeconde is the color / and corruption of the face / through the wattriſhe humidites lyke vnto mans vrine myngled with the bludde / whiche are wonte to be waſted by watche / yt nowe with the bludde they aſcende towarde the brayne & the face / and cauſe it to ſwelle / and to waxe pale. The thirde incōuenience is / that after noone ſlepe ingendreth the ſplene / and that by the kepynge in of the groſſe melancoly humours by the day reſt. For as watche with the heate of the day (whiche do open) gyueth mouynge and way to melancoly

humours / by the ſtrayte cundites of the body: ſo the daye ſlepe letteth and diſtroyeth the paſſages and ꝓpre wayes of them: & ſpecially it deſtroyeth the cundites / yt come from the ſplene to the mouth of the ſtomake / made to prouoke mans appetite / by whiche cundite all melancoly ſuperfluites are wonte cōmonly to be clarified. The .iiij. is / that after noone ſlepe mollifieth the veynes / by cauſe the humedites / whiche are wonte to be deſolued by the day watche / can nat be reſolued: whiche ſo remaynynge in mans body drie vp the veynes. The .v. incōuenience is / that mā by reaſon of reſt or ſlepe / loſethe his appetite / for lacke of humors reſolution: whiche reſolution is chiefe and principall cauſe of ye appetite. An other reaſon is the repleniſſhynge of the ſtomake by fumes and humidites / mollifieth and fyllethe the mouthe therof. The .vi. incōuenience / that after noone ſlepe doth engendre / is impoſtumes / by meanes of humidites encreaſed by ye day ſlepe / whiche drawe to one membre or other / and ſo cauſe it to ſwelle. Auicen ſayth / that beſides all theſe aforſayde / there be .ij. other ſpeciall cauſes / that proue the after noone ſlepe to be hurtfull. The fyrſt is / that the day reſt is ſoone corrupted / bycauſe the heate of the daye draweth the corporall heate to the exterior partis of man: but the nyght reſt dothe clene contrarie / for it draweth the corporall heate of man towarde the inwarde partis. Of the whiche two motions there is engendred a violent mocion that diſtourbethe nature. And therfore they that wyll ſlepe &

reſt them by day: are counſayled to ſlepe in darke places / and in the ſhadowe. The .ij. cauſe is that the day reſte maketh a man vnluſty / drouſy / and as halfe a ferde / and that by the changynge of nature from his olde cuſtome / that is from digeſtiō of his meate: yet nat withſtandynge that the after noone reſt is generally diſpreyſed / & the nyght reſte greatly cōmended and preyſed / yet the ſlepe that is taken in the mornyng from .iij. houres before the ſonne ryſynge / tyll .iij. of the clocke after ye ſonne is ryſen / is nat to be diſpreyſed: As Hippocrates ſaith in his .ij. boke of pronoſtic. Slepe cō
               uenient and naturall taken by nyght or by day is allowable / and contrarie is hurtfull: but the mornynge ſlepe of all the day is leſt worthy diſpreiſe. And all be hit the day ſlepe and at after noone are forbyden by olde fathers and doctours / yet for all that / nowe adayes ſlepe taken in the day tyme is nat greatly to be blamed ſpecially as Bartrutius ſaythe / if theſe .v. condicions therin be diligently obſerued. The fyrſt is / if hit be cuſtomably vſed: The .ij. that it be nat taken immediatly after dyner. The .iij. that one ſlepe nat with a lowe heed. The .iiij. nat to ſlepe to lōge. The .v. nat to be waked ſodeynly & ferfully / but with good moderatiō.
            
               Quatuorex vento veniunt in ventre retento.
               Spaſmus. hydrops. colica / vertigo. quatuor iſta.
            
            Here are declared .iiij. inconueniences that come by to longe holdynge of wynde in mans bodye. The fyrſt is called the crampe. The ventoſites of the body / ronne ofte amonge the iointes & veynes

fyllynge them with wynde. Qf the whiche fyllynge cōmethe retraction and wrynkelynge to gether of the veynes. And Auicen ſaythe in his .ij. diſt. the crampe is a diſeaſe that lyethe in the veynes: by the whiche the membres of man moue & extende them ſelfe. This crampe is diuers: one is cauſed by replenyſhynge: wherby the membre is made ſhorte and great / and wrynkelynge to gether as lether / or a harpe ſtrynge / throughe the matter / replenyſhynge the mēbres. This kynde of crampe cometh ſodaynely. There is a nother kynde of the crampe moche lyke a taboret: whiche inforceth the membre after his lengthe & largenes to crompull to gether like parchement caſt in the fire. This kynde of crampe cometh ſlowly. The ſeconde incōuenience is called the dropſye / a materiall diſeaſe engēdred of mattier ryght colde entrynge and inflatynge the membres or places of mans body / in whiche is the regiment / that is the digeſtion of meates and humours as the ſtomake / the lyuer / and the voide places about the bealye. For dropſye neuer engendreth / but whan the lyuer is corrupt by reaſō of the bludde. There be .iij. ſpices of dropſy. Ipoſarca / aſclides / & tympanites: & of the tympany this .ij. incōueniēce is vnderſtande. A tympany (as ſayth maiſter Bartruce) is ingēdred of ill cōplextion / by coldenes of the ſtomake / & lyuer / nat ſufferyng mans drynke or meate to be cōuerted in to good humours / but tourneth them in to ventoſites / whiche if they be auoyded by belchynge / by ſweate / or other wyſe / 

they wyll ſtoppe the wayes of voidāce. Alſo theſe ventoſities gether to gyther betwene the places of the bealye called mirac / and ſiphax / and there ingendreth the dropſy. The .iij. inconuenience / is called the colike / a perillous & a paynefull diſeaſe / it ingendreth in a gutte named colon. Like as the diſeaſe called ilica / is ingendred in one of the guttes called ylion. And theſe .ij. diſeaſes are ingendred by ventoſites cloſed in the guttes. The .iiij. inconuenience and diſeaſe is the heed ache called vertigo: whiche maketh a man to wene that the worlde turneth: the ventoſites of the brayne cauſeth this infirmite: whiche drawē to the brayne / & myxte with the lyuely ſpiritis / cauſeth the heed age called vertigo. Auicen in his .xvj. diſt. reherſeth theſe inconueniēces with other: and he ſayth that ventoſites kepte longe / cauſe and ingendre the colicke / by reaſon they aſſende and gether to gether / feblyſſhynge the guttes. And ſome tyme ingendreth the dropſye: and ſome tyme darkenes of ſyght / and ſome tyme the megryme / and ſome tyme the fallynge yuel / and ſome tyme it runneth in to the ioyntes and cauſeth the crampe.
            
               Ex magna cena / ſtomacho fit maxima pena
               Vt ſit nocte ſenis / ſit tibi cena breuis.
            
            Here we be taughte to make a lyght ſouper. For to moche meate lettethe mans naturall reſte / and cauſeth anguyſhe & gnawyng in the bealy / & cauſeth the face to breake out: & maketh one to haue a heuye heed in the mornynge / and an vnſauerye mouthe. Here this queſtion cometh well to pourpoſe.

Whether a man ſhulde eate more at dyner or at ſoupper? For a diffinicion here of / it is to be noted: that after the quantite of the bodye more or leſſe / meate is conuenient at ſoupper / or at dyner. For other the bodyes be holle and ſounde / orelles ſycke. If they be ſycke eyther incline to materiall ſickenes / or to vnmateriall: If ye ſickenes be nat cauſed through ſome humour: one may eate the more at ſoupper: bicauſe in ſuche ſickeneſſes / nature only endeuereth to digeſte the meate. If the ſickenes be materiall / one maye eate the more at diner / as it is declared in the .iiij. treatiſe in the .v. chap. of the curation of fallynge ſickenes on this wyſe: He that can nat be ſufficed with one repaſt in a day / bicauſe he is other wyſe accuſtomed / he muſt deuide his meate in thre partis / and eate .ij. partis at dyner / and the other parte after temperate exerciſe at ſoupper. The reaſō here of is this: For in ſuche ſeſonne ye feble nature hath helpe by the naturall heate of the ſonne to digeſt / and the ſuperfluites there by are more reſolued / wherfore the refection ſhulde be larger at diner thā at ſoupper. And more ouer bycauſe the heate of the day / whiche cauſeth digeſtion / ioyneth with the naturall heate of mans body: and ſo by day are .ij. ſondrye heates to helpe the digeſtion: but it is nat ſo in the nyghte. Lyke wyſe nature endeuereth by night to digeſt the ſuꝑfluites. Therfore it ſhulde nat be hyndred to digeſt with to moche meate. And though it be ſo that the naturall heate of mā be in many thynges fortified in the nyght: as by

retraction of the ſpiritis and reductiō of ſlepe: yet that ſelfe heate can nat digeſt .ij. diuers thynges / as the meate / & the ſuꝑfluites. Than it foloweth that ſuche folke ſhulde eate leſſe at ſouper. If the bodyes of ſuche ſeme hole / or elles be verye hole / ſtronge / & without any ſenſibilite of ſuperfluites / auoydynge all through theyr vigour / as myghty bygge men: ſuche may eate more at ſoupper. For the nature of theſe bodies / labour only by nyghte to digeſt the meate receyued: and nat to rype the ſuperfluites: for in a maner they haue none. Alſo they labour onely to fortifie theyr bodies / whiche waxethe more ſtronger by nyghte / than by daye: bicauſe the bludde and corporall ſpiritis be ingendred by nyght in a more quantite / and better deuided throughe out the bodye. If the bodies be nat greatly diſpoſed / as is reherſed: but are diſpoſed to be lyghtly ſicke: Than whether they trauayle and labour ſore cōtinually with theyr armes and handes or nat: hit is beſt they eate more at dyner than at ſoupper. For meate is nat onely taken to noriſhe & reſtore ye body: but alſo to make moyſte / to ouer ſprynkylle and water the membres / that through great labour and trauaile they waxe nat drie: and lyke wyſe to withſtāde the diſſolution of naturall heate. Nor ſuche trauayle & labour letteth nat theyr true digeſtion. For we ſe by experience / that they eate twyſe or thryſe in a daye with good appetite / and good digeſtion. If the bodies be nat apte nor diſpoſed to labour cōtinually / as ye bodies afore reherſed: hit may chance .ij. wayes:

For either they labour very ſore / but nat continually: or they labour febly: wherby ſuꝑfluites encreace. They that trauayle moche: as in rydȳge or goynge aboute theyr worldlye buſynes / ſhulde eate more at ſoupper than at dyner: bycauſe the vnaccuſtomed great trauaile wolde nat ſuffre the meate taken at dyner to digeſt / but corrupte hit. Yea and farther through ſuperfluous mocion the naturall heate is diſolued / & ſpredde in euery mē
               bre of the body: whiche in the nyghte draweth to the inwarde partis of the body / and is the principall cauſe of good digeſtion. And therfore a good and a large ſoupper is more expedient for them / than a large dyner. Alſo the ſame ꝑſons were nat brought vp before this ſeſonne in ſuche great trauayle: and therfore theyr bodyes are full of humidites: whiche lyttell meate at dyner maye reſyſte ye reſolutions cauſed by great motions & trauaile. But in caſe they trauaile lyttell and eaſelye by the way / to eate more at dyner thā at ſoupper is beſt: as hit is declared in ſicke bodies / for they moſt cō
               monly are feble bothe of cōplection & of digeſtion / and the heate and lyght of the ſonne cōforte theyr naturall heate and ſpiritis. Alſo the reaſon herof is this / the corporall cūdites and paſſages by day are open: wherfore the ſuꝑfluites of the body are ſooner expulſed by daye than by nyghte. Farther they ought to eate but lyttell meate by nyght: for thā nature is greatly occupied to digeſt rawe humours: the whiche ſlepe muſt digeſt and brynge to good poynt. And though the digeſtion to digeſt and

great repletions of meates / and the ſuperfluous humours be holpe by the night. Yet neuer ye leſſe / the ſtreingthynge therof is nat ſufficiēt to digeſt great repletions of meates / and alſo ſuperfluous humours. And weteth well / ye cuſtome in eatȳge moche or lyttell at dyner or ſoupper / oughte to be regarded / and kepte. For cuſtome is good and neceſſary / for helthe of ye body / and to cure ſickenes: as appereth .li.ij. of ſharpe diſeaſes. For ſodeyne change of cuſtome is very hurtfull / and ſpecially for olde folkes. For nature can nat beare nor yet ſuffre ſodeyne mutation. And thus it is well proued / that we ought to eate more at dyner than at ſoupper: and that bicauſe ſickeneſſes are moſt cō
               monly materialles / yet for all that / if a man coude be contented with one repaſt in a day / it were better to take it at ſoupper / than at dyner: ſo that he be nat diſeaſed in the eies / or the brayne: for than it were better to take it at dyner / than at ſoupper. For the repletion of the ſoupper / hurtethe ſore the brayne and the eies. And witteth well that nat onely the repletion of the ſoupper / hurteth the ſtomacke / but alſo al maner of other repletions. For they ingendre opylations / feuers / putrifactions / the lepre / and vndigeſted humours. And Auicen (in the .xiij. diſt. of his .iij. boke / and chap. of thinges that hurte the ſtomake) ſayth / that al maner of repletions hurt the ſtomake: nor ye great eater by repletion augmenteth nat his bodye / for he digeſteth nat his meate: but he that eateth moderately / hath alwayes ſome appetite / & increaſeth

his body: for he digeſteth well his meate. Therfore we ought to take good hede we hurte nat our ſtomake by ouer moche repletion: nor yt we make nat our ſelfe pourſye / and the pulſe to beate more vehemently. In lyke maner repletion that ingē
               dreth lothynge of meate / ought principally to be eſchewed / but ſpecially whan it cometh of ill meates. For if hit come by ill meates / hit ingendreth payne in the ioyntes / in the raynes / in the liuer / and the goute: and generally al other fleumatike diſeaſes. And if it come by clene meates: it ingē
               dreth ſharpe feuers / and hotte impoſtumes. It foloweth than that this repletion muſte be eſchewed aboue al other. For it greueth both ſoule and body. Secondly we muſte take hede we ouer fylle nat our ſtomakes: and vtterly diſtroye our appetite: but we muſte kepe ſome appetite: and ſpecially they that haue a ſtrōge and a good appetite. Some there be that haue a feble appetite / & theſe ought to eate more than their appetite requireth.

            Here are certeine cōmandementes / whiche man deſyrynge helth / muſte of neceſſite obſerue & kepe more duely than eate or drynke. The fyrſte is / he ſhulde eate no maner of meates / without his ſtomake be net / and purged of all yll humours / by vomet or other cōuenient wayes. For if a man receyue meate with corrupte humours in to his ſtomake:

they wyll myngle them ſelfe to gether and cauſe the meate newely eaten to corrupt. The ſeconde is / to eate no more tyll the fyrſt meate eaten be digeſted and auoyded out of the ſtomake. For there is nothynge more hurtfull to mans bodye / than to caſte meate vpon meate nat digeſted / but only begunne to be digeſted. For the meate laſt taken / ſhall let the digeſtiō of that yt was firſt eaten: and the digeſtion of the meate firſte taken / ſhalbe firſt finyſhed: whiche departeth to the lyuer by ye veines called miſeraikes / and therewith cariethe the meate laſte taken nat yet well digeſted. Wherof rawe humours and vndigeſted be multiplied in mans bodye. Farther in the texte are put .ij. tokens / to knowe whan the ſtomake is voide of the meate before taken. The fyrſte is verye hunger. And for a knowlege hereof / witteth well yt there is ij. maner of hungers / very hunger / and feyned hunger. Very hunger is diſcriued by Galen in ye cōment of the canon of the aphoriſme / Indigentia non oportet &c. Very hunger (ſaythe he) is whan a man nedeth meate: But fayned hunger is an appetite to haue meate / thoughe the bodye hath no nede therof. And as verye hunger cometh by contraction and corrugation of the veynes procedȳge from the mouthe of the ſtomake / by ſugillation of the membres nedynge meate: ſo in lyke wyſe feyned hunger is wonte to be cauſed of them that cō
               ſtrayne that they ſhulde ꝓuoke the mouthe of the ſtomake / the membres hauyng no nede of foode / as by colde thynges harde or ſharpe. And of this

ſigne & .ij. precept precedent / Auicen .iij.j. doct .ij. cap. de eo quod &c. ſaythe: No man ought to eate but after he hath a luſte: Nor he ſhulde nat tarye longe therin / whan luſt pricketh / onles it be a feyned luſte / as the luſte of kronkers / or ſuche whoſe ſtomake aborrethe meate: For to endure hunger longe fylleth ye ſtomake with putrified humours. And after in the ſame chap. he ſaythe: That who ſo euer loue their helth / ſhulde neuer eate tyll they haue a ſure luſte: nor tylle theyr ſtomake and vppermoſte entrayles / be voided of the fyrſte foode. For the dangeruſt thinge that may chance mans body / is to receiue meate vpon dndigeſted meate. The .ij. that ſignifieth true luſte / or very hunger / is ſklendre diete precedēt: that is ſmall ſuſtināce before taken: for whā hunger foloweth there vpō it is verye true hunger. Farther more knowe ye / that to eate moche and of ſondry meates mixed to gether at one repaſte or refection / is worſte of all: as fleſhe and fiſhe / chekyns and porke: and after to ꝓlonge the tyme in eatyng: For the firſt meate begynnethe nowe to digeſt / whan the other are brought to the table: and ſo the partis of ye meate are vnlyke in digeſtion: So that the fyrſte taken are digeſted / or the laſt taken come to the myddes of theyr digeſtynge: And this cauſethe that ſome partis corrupt other ſome. And this thyng Auicē iij.j. doct. cap. ij. de eo &c. warneth / ſayeng: There is nothynge more dangerous than to myngle diuers ſuſtinances to gether: and after to prolonge the tyme in eatynge. For whan the laſte meate is

receyued / the fyrſte is welnere digeſted. Therfore the ſaid meates in diuers of theyr partis (as touchȳg digeſtion) be nat lyke. But yet witteth well / that prolongynge of tyme in eatynge moderately (as an houre ſpace) to chawe and ſwolowe our meate well /

But prolongynge of tyme in eatynge / with talkynge and tellynge of tales .ij. or .iij. houres / is ryght hurtfull: & therof are ingendred the diſeaſes before reherſed.

            Here are declared .x. maner of meates or foodes that ingendre melancolye / and are vnholſome for ſicke folkes. Of whiche the fyrſt is eatynge of peches:Eatyng of peches. Wherof Galen .ij. alimentor̄ / cap. ix. ſayth / the ieuce of peches / and their materiall ſubſtance is ſoone corrupted and vtterly yll. Wherfore they ought nat as ſome ſay / to be eatē 
               aft other meate. For they ſwymmynge aboue are corrupted. But this oughte to be mynded / whiche is a commune thynge / that all that is moyſt / ſlyppery / & lightly gothe vnder / ſhulde be eaten fyrſte: and ſo ſhulde peches: whiche ſwyftely go to the bottum of the ſtomake / and make way for the meates that come after. But whan they be eaten laſt / they corrupte them ſelfe and the other meates. And thus it appereth

/ that this ſayenge ought to be vnderſtāde of peches eaten after other meate. For whan they be eaten before meate they be good for ye ſtomake / mollifie the bealye / and prouoke the appetite: as Auicen in the .ij. Canon & chap. of peches ſaythe: Ripe peches be good for the ſtomake / & gyueth an appetite to meate. And farther he ſaithe: They ouhgte nat to be eaten after other meate: for they corrupt after / but they muſt be eaten before. Like wyſe Serapion / in ye chaptre of peches / by auctorite of Dioſcorides / ſaithe: Rype peches are good for the ſtomake / and they mollifie the bealy: But whan they be nat rype they make a man coſtiue: and whan they be drie they bynde ſorer. And decoction made of drie peches and dronken / doth let the flowynge of humidites to ye ſtomake & bealy. And the pouder of peches caſt vpō ye place where one bledeth / ſtancheth the bludde. And al though peches haue theſe medicinable vertues aforſaid: yet bicauſe they ingēdre putrified humours / they be hurtfull to ſicke folkes / and ſpecially whā they be nat taken dewly. Peches be colde in the fyrſte degree / and moyſt in the ſeconde. The ſeconde is peres / or eatyng of peres. The cauſe is / Eatyng of peres. for peres (and generally al maner of newe and rawe frute) fylle ye bludde with water / boylynge vp in the body: And ſo prepareth the bludde to putrifie / and by conſequens hurtfull for ſicke folkes. Peres / as Auicen in .ij. canon̄ / and chap. of them / ſayth / engendre the colicke. But yet peres aboue all frute make folke fatte. And therfore hogges fedde with

peres / are made fatter thā wt any other frute. And bicauſe peres ingēdre ventoſites / and ſo cauſe the colicke: therfore they be vſed to be eatē with ſuche frute that breake or auoide ventoſites: or elles to withſtāde the ill operation of theſe frutes / drynke after them / a draughte of olde wyne of good ſauour. And the ſweter ſauour that peres haue / & the more doulce / the better they be. And alſo ſodde peres be better thā rawe: and they may be ſodde with anys ſede / fenell ſede / & ſuger. The thirde is eatynge of apples:Eatyng of apples. whiche as Auicen ſaythe (.ij. can̄. cap. j.) to eate often and moche cauſe ache of the ſenowes. And alſo apples haue an yll ꝓprete / in engēdryng ventoſites in the ſeconde digeſtion / wherfore they be vnholſome for ſicke folkes. And alſo for lyke cauſe as hit is before ſayde of peres. And theſe ſayenges of peres and apples oughte ſpeciallye to be vnderſtande whan they be rawe / and nat whan they be ſodde or roſte. And nat only theſe frutes ſhulde be eſchewed of them that be ſycke / but alſo all other frutes that fyll the bludde with boylynge water: as newe frute / whoſe ieuce boylethe in mans bodye as hit were muſt or newe wyne. And ieuce of frute boyle without in a veſſell and that is through the hete of the ſonne that remayneth in them whan they ryped. Theſe newe frutes / through boylynge of their ieuce / cauſe the bludde to putrifie. All though whā they be eaten they comfort a mans bodye with theyr moyſture. And for this cauſe Auicen forbyddeth them ſpecially eatynge of frute / yt haue the ague / in his .iiij.

diſt. and chap. of the vniuerſall cure / ſayenge: All frutes hurte them that haue the ague / throughe theyr boylynge and corruptyng in the ſtomake. The .iiij. is eatynge of mylke:Eatyng of mylke. the cauſe why eatynge of mylke is nat good / is bicauſe it is lyghtly corrupted / and turneth vnto fume or ſharpenes in the ſtomake / as in theyr ſtomake ſpecially / that are diſeaſed with putrified feuers: & therfore they that haue a putrified feuer are forbyden eatynge of mylke. And to them alſo hit is hurtfull yt haue the heed ache / to them yt haue the ſwyns pockes / & to many other. Wherof Hippocrates ſpeakethe in the Aphoriſme: Lac dare caput &c. to gyue them mylke that haue the heed ache is verye hurtefull. Yet nat withſtandynge in ſome diſeaſes / mylke is agreable for them that haue the tyſike / the feuer etike / and for ſome other: as Hipp. ſaith in ye afore allegate aphoriſme. And alſo folowynge / ſome thinge ſhall be ſaide whā we come to Lac ethicis &c. And all though mylke in the forſayd diſeſes is blamed / yet in them that be holle it is allowable / and that if it be well digeſted in the ſtomacke & lyuer. For thā it waſheth the ētrayles with it wattriſhenes / and hit mundifieth with hit buttrines: and ſtriueth agaynſt venomous humours: and with hit cheſe moyſteth the membres / and alleuiateth the grefes of the breſt: and hit doth mitigate the ſhotynge or prickynge of the longes / guttes / raynes / entrayles / and of the bladder: and it is good agaynſt prickynge humours in the entrayles. Farther more mylke is good for tēperate bodies / 

whoſe ſtomake is clene from colerike and flumatike humours. For to ſuche folke mylke well digeſted is great nouryſſhynge / hit ingendrethe good bludde / it nouriſheth the body / and conuenientlye moyſteth and makethe faire ye exterior partis: as Iſaac ſaith in the vniuerſall dietis. And there alſo he ſayth by auctorite of Ruffus: that they that wyll drynke mylke / muſt drynke it faſtynge: and it muſt be dronke hotte from the cowe: and to eate nothynge tyll that be digeſted: and nat to labour nor ſtere aboute moche than. Yet ſeldome or at no tyme one ſhulde forbeare walkynge / but than one muſte walke an eaſye pace / tyll he parceiue hit be diſcended to the bottum of ye ſtomake. But mylke is vnholſome for theſe bodies that be diſtēpered. For in hotte bodies it is ſoone turned in to colerike fumoſite. In ſuche as be colde / hit tournethe to ſharpenes and putrifaction. Alſo mylke is vnholſome for an vnclene ſtomake: for therin it corrupteth.Choyce of mylke. Touchynge the choyce of mylke / hit is to be noted / that meane mylke is to be choſen for nouriſhement / and nat thynne mylke / as mylke of a camell / or of an aſſe: nor the moſt fatte and groſſe is nat to be choſen / as mylke of kyne & ſhepe: wherfore goottis mylke ſhulde be choſen. For hit is nat ſo wattriſhe as camels mylke: the whiche is nat apte to nouriſhe / by reaſon of humidite / and hit maketh a man to laſke: Nor it is nat ſo fatte / nor ſo groſſe / nor ſo full of curdes and butter / as kowe mylke and ſhepis mylke is: whiche by reaſon of theyr fatnes / ſtoppe the heynes / and engendre vē / 

toſites: and is more harder of digeſtion thā is neceſſary in gouernance of helth. Therfore mylke of a gootte / nat to nere kyddynge tyme nor to farre from it / and that goth in a good paſture / & whan paſtures be at the beſt / ſhulde be choſen. The .v. is eatynge of cheſe:Eatyng of cheſe. and it may be vnderſtande of all ſortes of cheſe / but ſpecially of olde cheſe. The reaſon is bycauſe newe cheſe is colde / moyſt / and of groſſe ſubſtance / and harde of digeſtion: & engendreth opilations and the ſtone: and helpeth or cōſerueth mans helth (by way of nouriſſhement) very littell or nothynge: And olde cheſe is hotte & drie / by reaſon of the ſalte therin / hit cauſeth digeſtion: but yet of it ſelfe / it is harde of digeſtion / & of ſmall nouriſhemēt / and hurteth the ſtomake / & drieth ouer ſore / & agreeth wors thā newe cheſe. But cheſe betwene bothe / neyther newe nor olde / The bontie of cheſe nat to tough nor to brittill / to harde nor to ſofte / to ſwete nor to ſower / nat to ſalte / nor to full of eies / of good tallege & of good ſauour whan it is cutte / whiche tarieth nat lōge in the ſtomake / made cō
               ueniently of good mylke / ſufficiently oyly. Suche cheſe is good and ſhulde be choſen afore all other: wherof after meate we ſhulde eate a lyttell quantite: for moche in quātite / in way of nouriſhemēt is vniuerſally ill / and hurteth the ſtomake / & wyll nat digeſte / and engendreth opilations / the ſtone in the raynes / groſſe humours in the body / & ventoſites. Therfore that cheſe is onely good that cō
               meth out of any gardes handes. The .vj. is ſalte meate: dryed with ſalte or ſmooke / Salte meate. and of what

kynde of beſt ſo euer hit be / hit engendreth groſſe bludde and melancoly: and ſo per cōſequens / it is vnholſome for ſicke folkes: nor holſome for them that be hole: as Auicen .ij.j. doct. ij. cap. xv. about the ende / ſayth: that ſalte fleſſhe nouriſſheth but littell / and that it is groſſe / & engēdreth yl bludde. The .vij. is hartis fleſhe / Hartis fleſhe. whiche lyke wyſe engē
               dreth melancolye bludde / as witneſſeth Raſis Almā .iij. cap. de animalibus ſilueſtribus et domeſticis. The .viij. is hare fleſhe / Haare fleſhe. whiche lyke wyſe engendreth melancoly bludde / as Raſis ſayth in ye place afore allegate: This fleſhe engēdreth more melā
               colye than any other. And of this Iſaac in dictis vniuerſalibus ſayth: that hare fleſhe ſhulde nat be eaten as meate / but onelye vſed in medicines. And witteth well that hare fleſhe & hartis fleſhe / whan they be olde oughte vtterly to be eſchewed: yet neuer the les they may be eaten / & they be beſt before caluynge tyme / that theyr drines may be tempered with the age: And yet they ought to be eſchewed excepte they be fatte. For their drines is tempered with theyr fatnes. The .ix. is goottis fleſhe. The .x. is oxe fleſhe. For theſe be melancolye fleſſhes. For Iſaac in dictis vniuerſ. ſaythe: Gootis fleſhe and oxe fleſhe be worſt / Gootis fleſhe.

                  •
               oweſt of digeſtion: and whan they be digeſted / they engendre groſſe bludde and melancoly. And Auicen in his .ij. canon of goottis fleſhe ſaythe: Goottis fleſhe is nat very good / and ꝑchance the humour is very yll. And lyke wyſe ye ſhal vnderſtande of goottis fleſhe and cowes fleſhe: whiche

are worſe than the forſaide fleſhes / gootis and oxe fleſhe. For of them Auicen in the .ij. Canon the chap. of fleſhe / ſayth: Cowe fleſhe / hartis fleſhe / wylde goottis fleſhe / and great foules engēdreth the feuers quartans. And yet farther he ſaythe of cowe fleſhe: that cowe fleſhe nouriſſheth moche / and engendreth groſſe melancoly / and melancoly diſſeaſes. And he ſaythe farther that cowe fleſhe engendreth lepre. And of goottis fleſhe he ſaythe that hit is abſolutely yll. And for as moche as hit is touched in ye texte what fleſhes ſhulde be eſchewed / ſpecially of .iiij. footed beſtes: me ſemeth hit were conuenient / to ſhewe / what fleſhe of .iiij. footed beſtis are to be choſē. And in the choyce of fleſhes the phiſitians agree nat.Choyce of fleſhes. For Galen and certeyne other ſay / that porke is beſt. Some other / as Auicen / Raſis / and Auerroys ſay / that kyddis fleſhe is beſte. Yet nat withſtandynge Auerroys in the .v. coll. blamethe Auicen / by cauſe he ſayde porke was beſte: yet he ſayde it nat as though he helde therwith / but after the chriſten opinion. Some other preyſe vele aboue all other. The .ij. is / a man may knowe the beſt fleſhe of .iiij. footed beſtis & ye goodnes therof many maner of wayes. Fyrſt by great nouriſſhynge / whiche thinge betokeneth harde digeſtion / & by the lykenes of mans fleſhe: and this wiſe porke is better thā any other fleſhe / fyrſte for the lykenes vnto mans fleſhe: as witneſſeth Galen .iij. alimentor̄ / where he ſayth: That porke is like mans fleſhe / may be knowen / by that that many haue eaten mās fleſhe in ſtede

of porke / and coude nat perceiue neither by the ſauour nor the taſte / but that hit had bene porke. And Auicen .ij. canon̄. cap. de ſanguine / ſaythe: Mans bludde and hogges bludde be like in euery thynge: ſo that there haue bene that haue ſolde mans fleſhe in ſtede of porke / whiche thyng was nat ſpied / tyll a mans fynger was fonde amōge ye fleſhe. Auerrois writeth ye ſame in the .v. coll. cap. de carne. Secondely / Porke nouriſheth greatly. For Gal. ſaithe .iij. alimentor̄ / that porke aboue other fleſhe nouriſhe mooſte: wherof thoſe that be called athlete haue beſte experience. And after in the ſame boke he ſaythe: One can eate no fleſhe ye nouriſheth more thā porke. Thirdly porke engē
               dreth a ſtedfaſte and a ſtronge nouriſhement / reſiſtynge reſolution. This is Galens opinion in the places afore reherſed / where he preferrethe porke aboue all other fleſhe: and in his .viij. boke de ingenio / he ſaythe / Porke of all fleſhe is moſte laudable: ſo that it be wylde brought vp on montaynes: and next porke kyd. And lyke wiſe in .v. tera. he ſaith: Of al fleſhe of .iiij. footed beſtis porke is moſt laudable / whiche is temperate in heate and moyſture: and engendreth better bludde thā any other fleſhe: ſo that hit be of yonge ſwyne / that is of a yere or .ij. olde / whether hit be wylde or tame: nor yonge ſuckers are nat ſo good: for theyr fleſhe is mooſte moyſte. And of a more lykelyhod wylde porke broughte vp in the woddes / is better than tame brought vp at home: for tame porke is more clammy thā it ought to be. And of wylde hogges

fleſhe or boore / Auicen .ij. Canon̄ / cap. de carne / ſayth: Chriſten men and their folowers ſay / The beſte hog fleſhe that the beſt wylde fleſhe that is / is of a wylde ſwyne. For beſides that that it is more light than ye tame ſwynes fleſhe / it is of more ſtrengthe and moche more nouriſhynge / and more ſoner digeſteth: and in wynter there can be no better fleſhe. So thā it foloweth that hogges fleſhe is ryghte good & holſome for their bodies that be yonge / hole / ſtronge / occupied in labour / and nat diſpoſed to opilatiōs: & for them that deſyre to be fatte. For ſuche haue nede of moche nouriſhement: and harde of digeſtion. And therfore Raſis .iij. Almāſoris / cap. de virtute carniū / ſaith: Groſſe fleſhe is conuenable for them ye labour moche: but clene fleſhe is beſte for them that do contrarie wyſe. Auicen wyll the ſame .iii.i. ca. de regimine eius quod comeditur. ſayenge: They that labour moche maye better a way with groſſe meates than other. The choyce of good fleſhe ſtandeth in .iij. thynges: in temperance of cō
               plection / in lightnes of digeſtion / and ingendrȳge of good bludde: that is to ſay / the better fleſhe is of temperate complection / eaſy of digeſtion / and temperate in engendrynge bludde / betwene hotte and colde / ſklenderneſſe / and groſſenes. And for this cauſe kydde fleſhe is better & more laudable than any other fleſhe / after the mynde of Raſis / Auicen / and Auerrois. For Raſis .iii. Almāſoris / ca. de animalibus / ſilueſtribus et domeſticis. ſaythe: Kydde fleſhe is temperate / without any yll mixion: the whiche though it ingendre temperate bludde / yet

hit is nat conuenient for laborers: but yet for all that / no nother fleſhe ſhulde be preferred before it. Hit is nat ſo weke / that man ſtrength is miniſhed therby: nor the nouriſhynge therof is ſo moche groſſe / ye replecion ſhulde come of it / or groſſe bludde be engendred. The bludde alſo that is engendred therof / is betwene ſubtile & groſſe / hotte and colde. Nor this fleſhe is nat mete for greatte labourers / but for attemperate yonge folkes / vſynge meane exerciſe. For this fleſhe engendreth bludde / that by myghty exerciſe or labour is ſone reſolued / but nat with meane trauaile. And (touchynge the intētion) as kydde fleſhe is better thā any other houſolde fleſhe / ſo gottis fleſſhe is better thā any other bredde in the woddes. And next to kydde fleſſhe many phiſitians / as Raſis and Auerrois / put muttō. And Auerrois ſaith .v. coll. cap. de carne: That mooſte part of phiſitions are of this opiniō / ſaue Galen whiche laudeth nat mutton. And he thynketh that veale nouriſheth more than mutton. And perauenture Galen vnderſtā
               deth here the betternes of nouryſhement of that that is to nouriſhe moche / and to gyue nouriſſhemēt more harde of reſolution / whiche more agreeth vnto veale than mutton / ſyns mutton is of more humidite. Thirdly the goodnes and choyce of fleſhe maye be taken by reaſon of theyr ſmalle clāmynes / and by theyr good ſauour: and herein veale is better than any other fleſhe. And this is ſhewed of Auerrois .v. coll. ca. de carne / ſayenge: And veale is good fleſhe bicauſe hit is nat clāmy / 

colde / nor drie as befe is / and veale hath a ſwetter ſauour than any other fleſhe: and in theſe poyntis it is better than kydde fleſhe: for in kyd fleſhe one may perceiue a clammynes before it is ſodde: and in that ye veale ingēdreth better humours / it is better thā kyd. And thus it appereth playnely what is the cauſe of controuerſite amonge phiſitians touchynge the choyce of fleſſhes.The cōtr

                  uerſite in choyce of fleſhe. Farther witteth well / that the fleſhe of drye cōplection / is better nere caluynge tyme thā farre from it: And therfore kyddis and caulues be better thā goottis and oxen: bicauſe their drines is abated with the humidite of theyr yongnes. But fleſhe of beaſtis of moyſt complection / is better and more holſome in age than in youthe. For theyr ouermoche humidite is dried moche awaye / as they encreace in age: And therfore wethers of a yere olde are leſſe clāmy and more holſomer than ſuckynge lāmes: and lyke wyſe porkes of a yere or .ij. olde / are better thā yonge pygges. And therfore Auicen ſaith well .iii.i. cap. de reg. eius quod comeditur. It behoueth yt the meate / that conſerueth helth ſhulde be ſuche as the fleſhe of kydde or a ſuckyng caulfe is / or lā
               mes of a yere olde. By theſe reaſons it apperethe than that the fleſhe of goottis male and female / of olde mutton / of befe / of olde porke / and ſpecially of brawne / of pygges / and of ſuckynge lammes / is nat verye holſome for the conſeruation of mans helthe: but the fleſhe of yonge caulues / of yerelynge wethers / and porke of a yere or .ij. olde / is conuenient inoughe to eate to preſerue mans

helth.Fleſhe. And it is to be well noted / that fleſhe enclyned to drynes / muſte be ſodde: and inclynynge to humidite / muſte be roſted / to attempre theyr humidite: And therfore the fleſhe of conys / haaris / hartes / calues / and kyddis / ſhulde be ſodde: and porke and lāme roſted: for ſethynge attemprethe the drynes. And herby appereth / that in moyſte ſeaſons / and for moyſt complections fleſhe diſpoſed to drynes / ſhulde be roſted: and in drie ſeaſōs / and for complections drie and olde / moyſt meates be more conuenient.

            Here in this texte bene expreſſed dyuers nouryſhynge meates.Of egges. The fyrſt are newe layde egges / whiche be of that ſorte / that in littell quātite nouriſhe moche / as ſaythe Auicen .ii. canon̄. cap. de ouis.
and lyke wyſe he ſaythe in .iiij.j. cap. j. Thynges (ſayth he) of ſmalle quantite and great nouriſhement are egges and cockes ſtones. And the ſelfe ſame he repetethe in manye other places. Touchynge the choyce of egges / witteth well that the egges of hennes / pertriches / and feſances yonge and fatte are very good in regiment of helth / and ſimply / better thā any other egges: For the preſt daughter ſayde / that lōge egges and ſmalle were the beſt of all / as in theſe verſes:

                  Filia preſbiteri iubet pro lege teneri.
                  Quod bona ſunt oua / candida / longa / noua.
               
            
            Farther / poched egges / are better than egges roſted hard or rere / and they be of great nouriſhement

/ and of good and lyght digeſtion / and engē
               dre bludde ſpeciallye proportionable to the harte: Wherfore they be excedynge good for ſuche as be recouered from ſickenes / for aged folke / and for weake ꝑſons / and ſpecially the yolke. For Auicen in the treatiſe de viribus cordis ſaith: that the yolke of egges / of foules whoſe fleſhe is good to be eatē / as of hennes / pertriches / and feſantis / thoughe they be nat medicinable for the harte / yet they cō
               forte ryghte moche. And he addethe folowynge: That they be lyghtly turned in to bludde: & after they be turned / they haue ſmall ſuperfluite: And therfore they comforte mooſte ſpecially the harte. And farther he ſaythe / that they be excellent good to reſtore the ſpiritis & bludde of the harte: Rere roſted egges are lyghtly digeſted / and they eaſe ye longes and the breſte / and mollifie the bealy tēperately / but they nouriſhe nat ſo moche as poched egges. Harde egges ſodde are harde of digeſtiō / and they nouriſhe the body groſſely / deſcendynge ſlowly to the ſtomake / & ſlowly they entre therin: Farther witteth well / that egges by the dreſſinge of them are made better and worſe:Dreſſynge of egges. For eyther they be roſted / ſodde / or fried / or ſodde with ſome brothe. Roſted egges be more groſſe than ſodde / and more harde of digeſtion: for the herthe or fire driethe vp theyr ſubſtanciall humidite. And they be roſted .ij. wayes: For either in the ſhelles they be raked in the hotte imbers / orels they be broken in the ſhelles. They that be broken be worſe than the other: but they that in the ſhelles be raked in

the hotte imbers are done .ij. maner of wayes / either they be all raked in the imbers / orels ſette vpon imbers & coles with parte vncouered. They that be al couered be worſe: for by reaſon that the heate of the fire goth about them / the fumoſites / are kepte ſtyll in / they that be ſette vpon the ymbers / parte vncouered / auoyde out the fumoſites and be mundified. They be better ſoddē in water thā roſted: for the humidite of the water ſtriueth with the heate of the fire / drienge their humidite. And ſo they be dreſſed .ij. wayes: For eyther they be ſodde in the ſhelles / orels broken in the water. Sodden in the ſhelles are worſe than the other. For the ſhelles lette diſſolution of fumoſitees and groſſenes. Whan they be poched / the heate of the water temperately perceth in / and maketh more pure theyr groſſenes: and takethe awaye the yll ſmell and ſauour. Wherfore poched / they be moſt holſome / and worſt fried: For fried they ingendre moſt yll humours / Raſis opiniō in dict. vniuerſa. and hurte the ſtomake / & cauſethe fumoſite and corruption / and maketh one to lothe his meate. But ſodde in ſome good brothe are betwene bothe / roſted and poched. Alſo wytteth well / that there is a diuerſite in an egge / touchynge his cōponde partis. For the yolke is temperately hotte: The white is colde and clammye / and hardlye digeſteth / and the bludde alſo therof engendred / Raſis .iii. Alm. ca. de vir. ouorū. is nat good. And as the forſayde egges / that is to ſay of hennes / pertriches / and of feſantis / be more cōuenable in ye regimēt of helth: ſo egges of duckes / gees ſhouelardis / & ſuche like

foules / are vnholſome in the regiment of helthe / and ſhulde be eſchewed. The .ij. is redde wyne.Red wyne Where vpon ye ſhall vnderſtande / yt wynes differ in colours. For ſome wynes be whyte / ſome claret / ſome citrine / and ſome blacke. White wyne is febler thā any other / colder and leſſe nouriſhyng / but they leeſt hurte the heed / and they make one to pyſſe better than other. That they be weaker than other wynes appereth: for after Galen. ſuꝑ .i. canone .iii. ꝑticule regiminis acutorum. Weake wyne is hit / that leeſt heteth or enflameth / & leſſe greueth the brayne than other. That white wynes be colder than other apperethe by Galen in the cōment of the canon .iii. partic. reg. acutorū. where he ſaythe of white wyne / thus: It is impoſſible that white wyne ſhulde greatly enflame any man. And after he ſaith: White wyne enflameth or heteth leeſt of all wynes. Whiche thynge is trewe / if one wyll make cōpariſon betwene white wyne and redde of one countre growynge / and none other wyſe. For the redde wynes of Frāce are nat ſo hotte / nor yet ſo ſtronge as the whyte wynes of ſome other coū
               tre. And therfore the cōpariſon muſte be made betwene the wynes of one maner and countre: and that they nouriſhe leſſe than other wynes appereth by Galen in the cōment of this aphoriſme .ii. particule aphoriſ. It is eaſyer to fyll one with drinke than with meate: where he ſaythe: Watteryſſhe ſklender & white wyne / is vniuerſally neighbour to water: and as touchynge nouriſhement is like water / wherby it prouoketh one to piſſe / and nouriſheth

one to pyſſe. And this is the cauſe / that ſtronge wynes / be nat cōuenient for feble brayned folkes / as it is ſaide: But it agreeth well with them that haue a ſtronge brayne: For a ſtronge brayne reſiſteth vapours whā they ſmyte vp there vnto / as Auicen ſaythe .iij.j. and chap. afore allegate. And here noteth well / that the witte of a man hauyng a ſtronge brayne / is clarified and ſharped / if he drynke good wyne / than if he dranke none / as Auicen ſaythe .iij.j. and chap. afore allegate. And the reaſon is / bycauſe of good wyne more than of any other drynke are engendred and multiplyed ſubtile ſpiritis clene & pure. And this is the reaſō why that theſe diuins / imagynynge & ſtudyenge highe and ſubtyle matters / loue to drynge good wynes. And after the opinion of Auicen in the forſayde chap. theſe wynes are good for men of colde and flumatike complection. For ſuche wynes redreſſe and amende the coldeneſſe of complection: and they open the opilations & ſtoppynges / that are wonte to be engendred in ſuche perſons / and they digeſt fleme / helpinge nature to conuert and tourne them in to bludde: they lyghtlye digeſte / and entre quickely / they encreace & greatly quickē the ſpiritis. But wyne citrine is nat ſo burnynge as redde claret / as Galen in the cōment of the canon afore allegate ſaythe. Redde wynes be hotter than white / & therfore they greue the heed more / as Galen ſaythe in the canon / Potus autem duicis. Alſo claret wyne nouriſheth leſſe than redde / and more than whyte. And in ſome places they calle

claret wyne white: and that is ye cauſe that ſome ſay that white wyne doth quickely enflame mans bodye. The blacke wynes be nat ſo feruent hotte as the redde be. And therfore they hurte the heed leſſe. But for as moche as they diſcēde more ſlowly in to the bealy / and prouoke more ſlowly mans vrine / they greue the heed more thā white wyne / as Galen ſaythe in the canon Potus autem dulcis. And theſe wynes nouriſhe leſſe than white or citrine / and leſſe than redde wyne. The thyrde is ſuppynges / made of good brothe of fleſſhe / ſuppinges or brothes. but ſpecially of chekyns: for ſuche brothes are verye frendly to mans nature: and are lightly cōuerted in to good bludde / and ingendrethe good bludde / ſpecially whan hit is made with fyne flower. For flower / principally of wheate / is greatly nouryſhynge / and cauſeth great nouriſhemēt / as ſaithe Ra
                  •
               is .iij. Alman. And theſe .iij. forſayde thynges Auicen putteth .ii.i. doct. ii. ſūma. i. ca. xv. in ye ende / where he ſaithe: Example of clene and good nouryſhynge meates and humours be the yolkes of egges / wyne / and brothes made of fleſſhe: and there vpon he concludeth / that theſe .iij. forſayde thynges are comfortable and of great reſtoratiue for mans body.

            Here are touched .xij. maner of thynges / whiche greatlye nouryſhe and make fatte mans bodye.

The fyrſt is breadde made of wheate:Breadde. whiche as Auicen ſaythe .ii. can̄ cap. de pane. fatteth ſwyftely / ſpecially whan it is made of newe wheate. Raſis iij. Alm̄ ſayth: wheate is neighbour to tēperāce / all though it incline a littell to heate: & the heuieſt and ſoundeſt / nouriſheth beſt: and of all graynes hit is moſt holſome for all folkes: And the bludde engendred therof is more temperate than of any other grayne.Choyce of wheate. Touchynge the choyce of wheate / ye ſhal vnderſtāde that the election is to be conſydered .ii. maner of wayes: Fyrſt on the bihalfe of his ſubſtance: an other way on the bihalfe of his preparation. The choyce on ye byhalfe of his ſubſtāce Auic. putteth .ij. can. chap. of corne / ſayenge: That is the better that is neither harde nor ſofte / great / fatte / and newe / nat to olde / betwene redde and whyte. Blacke wheate is an yll nouryſſher. Raſis ſaythe hit is heuye. Touchynge the choyce concernynge the preparation / witteth well / that all thinges made of wheaten flower deſcēde from the ſtomake ſlowelye / engendre groſſe humours / cauſe opilations aboute the lyuer / augment the ſplene / and engendre the ſtone / and digeſted nouryſhe moche. Wheate ſodde is heuy meate and indigeſtable / but whan it is digeſted / it nouriſheth ſtrongely / & ſtrengthe a man moche. But wheate made in bread / well leuened / and bakē in an ouen / hatte with moderate fire / is marueilous holſome. All theſe thȳges are gethered of Galen Alimētorū. The .ij. thynge is mylke:Buttter mylke. and after the mynde of ſome doctours / it is vnderſtāde by butter mylke /

Hit maye alſo be vnderſtande by goottis mylke:Gootis mylke. Grene cheſe. whiche nouryſheth moche: wherof we haue largely ſpokē before. The .iij. thynge is grene cheſe / whiche as Auicen ſaythe .ii. can. cap. de caſeo / is a nouriſher and a fatter. And al though grene cheſe nouryſheth and fattethe / yet hit is nat holſome in the regiment of helthe: for therof come the inconueniences before declared / Perſica poma &c. The .iiij. thynge is ſtones: and ſpecially ſtones of fatte cockes: whiche as Auicē

                  . ſayth: be very good and great nouriſhers: And he ſaith that in a ſmall quātite they nouriſhe moche. This alſo may be vnderſtande of hogges ſtones verye fatte / that hath nat boorred a lowe. For as porke of all .iiij. legged beſtis (touchyng his nouryſhynge) is beſt / in lyke maner the ſtones / in regarde of other beaſtis ſtones / are the beſte. And here is to be well noted / that the ſtones of aged beſtis / whoſe ſede is fermented / be nothynge nouryſhynge. But the ſtones of yonge beſtis / nat yet able to do theyr kynde / whoſe ſede of generation is nat yet rype: be of metely good nouriſhement / if they be well digeſted. The .v. thynge is porke / Porke. in choſynge wherof / and of theffecte of the ſame / is largely declared before / there / Perſica poma &c. The .vj. thinge is eatynge of braynes: And wyttethe well that brayne is yll for the ſtomake / Eatyng of braynes. and cauſeth lothſomnes / and takethe a waye a mans

appetite / and engēdreth groſſe humours: yet neuer the leſſe hit nouriſheth the body / if hit be well digeſted: But in no wyſe hit ſhulde be eaten after other meates. And if hit be dreſſed with penyriall or nepte / to attempre the clāmynes & colde therof / or with thynges / that by theyr vertue gyue hete: hit is good and holſome. And take hede / eate no brayne / outcepte hit be fyrſt hatte vpon the coles. And witteth wel / that it is nat good for them that be ſicke other while of colde diſeaſes: but for them that be hotte of cōplection hit is holſome / as Raſis .iij. Alm. ſayth / in the chap. de virtutibus membrorum animalium. And brefely hit is forbydden in the regiment of helthe. But yet ſome tyme hit dothe well in medicine: as the brayne of a lyttell gootte is good agaynſt venome / and againſt venomous byttynges: And a haaris brayne agaynſt tremblynge: And ſome ſay the brayne of chekyns and capons is good for the memorie / and comforte the wytte.Choyce of braynes. Yet touchynge the choyce of braynes / hit is to be knowē / that the beſt braynes be of foules that flee / and proprely aboute montaynes. And of .iiij. foted beſtis the beſt is of a rāme / and nexte of a caulfe / as Auicen ſaythe .ii. can. cap. de cerebro. The .vij. is marie / whiche well digeſted nouryſheth moche:Mary. as Auicen ſaith in the forſayd canon and chap. of marie. And hit is lyghtly tourned in to bludde: yet neuer the leſſe / it diſtroyeth the appetite / and makethe one to lothe his meate: And therfore Auicen teachethe vs to eate them with peper. And touchynge the choyce / Auicen ſaythe

the mary of veale / of a hart / of a bulle / of gootis / and of ſhepe / is moſte holſome. And ſome ſay the marye of yonge fatte bulles / is very holſome and good. The .viij. is ſwete wynes: wherof we ſhall entreate after there / Sunt nutratiua.
               Delicious meates. ii. particula aphoriſmorum. The .ix. is delicious meates / for ſuche moſt ſpecially nouryſhe / as Hippocrates ſayth. And Galen ſayth / that all ſouorie meate / wherin one deliteth whā he eateth hit / the ſtomake receyueth and reteyneth / and digeſteth that with a farre greatter delectation thā other: But if the meate be lothſome / the ſtomake wyll nat abyde hit: wherof vomite / abhorrynge of meate / inflation / and belchynge are engēdred. And that is ye cauſe we ſe ſome more helthye with cours meate / thā with good / bicauſe the courſe is more delicious vnto them. The .x. is rere egges:rere egges whiche in ſmall quantite nouriſhe moche / wherof we haue ſpoken before at oua recentia &c. The .xj. is ripe fygges: whiche through their ſwetnes / nouryſſhe and fatte moche. And touchynge fygges / Rype fygges. thoughe they nouryſhe nat as ſtronglye as fleſhe and grayne: yet there is no frute ſo ſtronge a nouryſher: as Auicen ſayth .ii. can. cap. de ficubus. And there he ſaythe / that fygges nouryſhe more than any other frutis. And he ſaith in regimine eius quod comeditur / that frutis of moſte nouriſhement / and moſt lyke and nere vnto fleſhe in nouriſhynge / be fygges / very rype reſyns / and dates. As concernynge the choyce of them / witteth well / Choyce of fygges. that after Auicen in the place aboue allegate de ficubus. The white is beſt / for hit is lighter: nexte the ruddy or citrine / 

Raſis in the place before allegate / hit nouriſhethe well / and comforteth the ſtomake and lyuer / and auoydethe opilations. And hit is ſayde / that the lyuer is fatted with them / and ſpecially if they be clenſed from ye graynes or kyrnels. And thus the forſaid text may be vnderſtāde of a freſhe gethred grape or a reſyn: or of a drie grape called paſſula.

            Here in this texte be declared .v. maner of proues of good wyne.The tokēs of good wyne. The fyrſt is ye ſmell / for wyne of good odour and flauour multiplieth mans ſpiritis: and as Conſtantine .v. theorice ſaith / it nouriſhethe well and engendrethe good bludde: But ſtynkynge wyne is vnholſome for mans nature / engendrynge groſſe and melancolye ſpiritis. And after the mynde of the ſayde Conſtantine / hit engendreth yll bludde and heed ache of the yll fume aſcendynge to ye heed. Galen .iii. reg. acut. cōmento. i. ſpeakynge of the diuerſite of wynes / of the odour ſaith: that wyne that hath good ſmell / engēdreth good bludde / but it fylleth ones heed full of fumes & vapours / bicauſe of the ſubtilte & heate therof: But yll ſmellynge wyne / after the quantite of yll bludde engendred therby / hurteth the heed verye lyttell / bycauſe hit is colde and groſſe. The .ij. is ſauour: for lyke as good ſauorye meate noryſheth better and is better receiued of the ſtomake / as is aforſayde / in lyke wyſe ſo doth wyne. But ye ſhall vnderſtāde / ye wynes differ in ſauour: for ſome be

ſwete / more nouriſhynge thā other / engendrynge groſſe bludde / and moyſtynge the bealye / yet they be harde of digeſtion / and engendre thyrſt. There is a nother ſorte of wynes called pontica or ſtyptica / whiche cōforte the ſtomake / and eaſeth the bealy / but hit hurthe the breaſt and purtenance / as the longes / and the pype therof: holſome for the entrayles & harde of digeſtion. There be other wynes yt be ſharpe or ſower: that ꝓuoke ones vrine / they engendre nat / but they diſſolue groſſe humours. There be other bytter wynes leſſe hotte: as ſaythe Conſtantine .v. theorice. The .iij. is clerenes or brightnes / whiche ſheweth the purenes of the wyne / and ſo conſequentlye of the ſpiritis therof engendred. The .iiij. is the colour. In colour wynes vary and differ greatlye in theyr nouryſhynge. For the ruddier wynes of the ſame parell are more noryſhyng than white. And therfore they be more holſome for leane folke than white: yet the white be more holſome for them yt be fatte. And of this diuerſite of wyne in colour / we haue ſpoken before at / oua recentia. Farther in the texte are put .v. ſpeciall thȳges / howe a mā ſhulde ꝓue & knowe good wyne. Fyrſt is by ye ſtrengthe / whiche is knowen by the operation.Gal. commēto .i.iii. pari. reg. acutorum. For as Gal. ſaith ſtronge wyne is hit that vehementlye enflameth a mans body / & repleteth the heed. This ſtronge wyne is ſpecial encreacer of the ſpiritis / & a great noryſher. But yet I aduiſe them yt haue a weake brayne to be ware howe they drinke ſtrōge wyne / outcept hit be well alayed with water. For the fumiſhenes

therof hurteth ye heed. The .ij. is fairenes of the wyne: For the fairenes or goodlynes of the wyne / cauſeth one to drinke it deſirouſly / whiche cauſeth hit better to digeſt / & better to noriſhe. The .iij. is fragrant and of good odour. For fragrant and redolent wyne cōforteth moſte / and engendreth ſubtile ſpiritis / as it is ſayde. The .iiij. is / that wyne muſte be colde touchynge the taſte / but hotte in effecte and operatiō. For wyne made hotte / by reaſon of the clerenes / and fynes / ouer cometh a mans brayne the ſoner / febleth the ſenowes / and hurteth the heed but if hit be taken moderately. The .v. is / that wyne muſte be friſke & ſprynkelynge / and with the ſpumynge to make a littell noyſe / and the ſpume to be thynne and ſoone flaſhed / and the ſpume to tarye in the myddes. For if it haue nat theſe ꝓpretes / it muſt be called hangynge / that is feble wyne / and ſpecially if hit make no ſowne / & hath great bubbuls & ſpume / that tarieth longe by the ſydes of the cuppe.

            Here is one doctrine of wyne declared: whiche is that groſſe and ſwete wynes be more nouriſhynge than any other of the parell. To this agreethe Conſtantine in the aboue allegate place: & ſo doth Auicen .iii.i. cap. de reg. aque et vini. where he ſayth: Groſſe wyne that is doulce / is beſte for hym that wolde be fatte. The reaſon is / bicauſe the doulce wynes / for theyr doulcetnes / are vehemently drawen of the mēbres / where with nature reioyceth. For Auicen ſayth .ii. can. tract. i. cap. iii. that the operations

of dulce wynes are digeſtion / mellowȳg / and encreaſynge of nouriſhement / and nature loueth hit / and the vertue attractiue drawethe hit. And all thoughe this texte may be verified by all doulcet wynes / yet the moderate doulce wyne / is to be choſen / & nat that that is excedynge doulce / as muſkadell: For ſuche corruptethe the bludde / by reaſon that nature draweth hit violently from the ſtomake to the lyuer / before it be wel digeſted / & before the ſuꝑfluite therof be ryped / & throughe the great dulcetnes therof / hit fyllethe the bludde with vndigeſted aquoſite / that maketh ye bludde apte to boyle and putrifie. And this alſo ſhulde be vnderſtande by other meates excedynge ſwete. And farther wytteth well / Three inconueniēce engendred of doulce foodes. that of the vſe of ſwete wyne and other doulce nouriſhementes .iij. inconueniences are to be feared / ſpecially of them yt be inclined therto. The fyrſt is lothyng: for ye ſwete foodes / through their heate & moyſture ſuppull & fyll the mouthe of the ſtomake / and there engēdre a diſpoſition cōtrarie to the vacuation & corrugaciō of hit / that cauſethe hunger. The .ij. is ſwyfte inflāmation of theſe doulce foodes & conuertynge in to coler. For doulce thinges moſt aptly engēdre coler. Therfore hony aboue all other thinges ſooneſt engendreth coler / bicauſe of ſwete thynges it is moſte ſweteſt: and nexte honye is ſwete wyne / as Galen ſaith. And here vpon riſeth thyrſtynes / Gal. in cō
                  mēto can. iii. ꝑt. reg. acutorum. nor hit is nat holſome for them that haue ye ague / nor for colerike folkes. The thyrde is opilation of the lyuer and ſplene: For theſe .ij. membres / and

ſpecially the lyuer drawe dulce thȳges with theyr dregges / to them / for the great delite they haue in them / before they be digeſted. Wherfore ther they lyghtly cauſe opilations / through the helpe & operation of the groſſe ſubſtance / wherin the ſauorynes of ſwetenes is grounded / as Auicen ſayth .ii. can. tract. i. cap. iii. And this is the cauſe that ſwete wyne doth leſſe ſtere one to pyſſe thā other wynes. Agaynſt theſe .iij. nocumētis egre or ſharpe ſauory thynges are very holſome: for with theyr tartnes they prouoke the appetite: & with theyr coldnes they quēche enflāmation / & with theyr fynes of ſubſtance they open opilations. Farther / wytteth well / that all though ſwete wynes / and other doulce nouriſhementes / ſtoppe or ſhutte the lyuer and ſplene: yet they vnſtoppe the lōges. And the reaſon why they ſtoppe nat the longes as well as the lyuer and ſplene / Gal. declareth in the cōmēt of the can̄ 
               .iii. part. reg. acut. Bicauſe doulce thinges in their paſſage / reſude nothȳge there to / but that that is fyne and pure: and the bludde engendred of doulce thynges cometh to the longis / purified fyrſt in the lyuer / Hipp. iii. ꝑticu. reg. acut. can. Mētem lemus &c. and fyned in the harte. Alſo as Hippocrates ſayth / Doulce wynes do leeſt make one dronken. Thus we may cōclude / that if wyne be dronke for nouriſhement / for reſtoratiue of the body / and to make one fatte / as it chāceth in them that be leane / whether it be naturally or accidentally: than doulce wynes and groſſe / ſufficiently colored are holſome. For ſuche wynes are nouryſhers / reſtore 
                  •
               es of ſuche as be lowe broughte / 

and fatters. Wherfore they be moſte cōuenient to fatte leane bodies. But if we entende nat to nouriſhe / to reſtore or make fatte our bodies / as they that be corſye and fatte: than though we may nat vſe ſwete wynes but ſubtile / yet they muſte choſe ſuche as be amiable / and haue good ſauour and flauour / enclined to whitenes / & ſufficiētly ſtrōge. If one drynke wyne to quenche his thyrſte / than he muſte take white wyne / thynne and feble. For ſuche wyne do moyſte more / and coulethe more: & ſo cōſequently / better quencheth thyrſte: And the greatter the thirſt is / the holſomer ſuche wyne is. But if ſo be wyne be dronke to refreſhe ye ſpiritis / and comforte the corporall vertue: than hit wolde be ſubtile / ſwete / & of delectable ſauour / of meane colour / & of ſufficient ſtrengthe: and ſuche wyne ought to be taken with litell meate: and hit muſt be depured from either ſuperꝑfluite / and to be taken in ſmall quantite. But if we purpoſe to ſcoure the breaſt and longes / & to cauſe vs to laſke: than doulce wynes of meane ſubſtāce / and of good flauour ſhulde be choſen.

            This texte ſheweth to vs .ij. hurtis / that come by ouer moche drynkynge of redde wyne. The fyrſt is / that ouer moche drynkynge of red wyne / maketh one coſtyue. The cauſe after the opinion of ſome / is. For ſuche redde wyne heatethe more than other of the parell / and is more nutratiue. For in that that hit is hotter / hit drieth more: & in

that ye hit is more nutratiue / it is more deſirouſly reteyned of nature. But yet this texte may be vnderſtande by ouer moche drinkynge of byndynge redde wyne / whiche is ſome what eger / ſharpe / & coſtiue. Yet concernynge this / wytteth well / that if the ſtomake or the guttis be feble in their naturall operation: than redde or blacke wyne / called ſtypticke / that is ſome what tarte / ought to be vſed and drōken: as they do / that by debilite of ſtomake / can holde nothynge / but be laxatiue. This ſaith Hippocrates in the canon Palmeus quidem &c. And alſo Galen in the cōment of the ſame. But if we wyll comfort the vertue of digeſtion / the clene wyne or meane in ſubſtance and colour / of good odour / and of conuenient ſauour / and of ſufficient ſtrength / & ſome what ſtipticke / is moſt holſome. The .ij. is horſenes of ye throte / whiche horſenes / ſome redde wynes / through their drynes & erthynes / cauſe and enduce. And this hurt cometh alſo by drinkynge of red wynes growynge in the parties of Brabant / throughe theyr ſtipticalnes and erthynes: and ſpeciallye whan the ſayde wynes be nat fyned / this grefe chancethe. But yet they make nat a man coſtiue: For muſt that is verye redde / is wonte to cauſe the flixe / by reaſon of his erthye dregges myngled there with all: whiche byteth and gnaweth the guttis: of whiche gnawynge comethe the flixe. And ſuche wyne ſhulde nat be dronke tyll hit be fyned. For ſo longe as hit is gnawynge / through the erthy dregges therof / a mordicant fume is reyſed to the brayne / whiche

gnawethe or bytethe the eies / and maketh them redde: Suche inconueniences are engendred by newe vnfyned wynes of Brabant / whether they be white or redde / through theyr erthynes. The cauſe why this fume is mordicatiue is by cauſe ye wyne that he cometh of is mordicatiue.Gal. in cō
                  mento illius aphori. Et qui creſcunt &c. For Gal. ſaythe: What ſo euer is diſſolued from a thynge / muſte nedes be lyke the thynge / from whiche hit is diſſolued.

            In this texte are cōpriſed .vj. remedies agaynſt venome. The fyrſte is garlyke: whiche is verye medicinable agaynſt ſuche incōueniences / Garlyke. as are wonte to engendre of water: and ſpeciallye hit is holſome / if one drynke yll corrupt water. Wherof Serap
                  •
               on in the ſegregatis and chap. of garlyke ſaythe: That if one eate garlyke fyrſt / and drinke corrupt water after / hit ſhall nat hurte hym. In lyke wyſe ſaith Auicen .ii. can. cap. de alleo. et .iii.i. ca. de conſer. a nocu. diuer. aquarum. The ſame operacion is alſo in oynions / as Auicen ſaith .ij. can. & chap. of oynions / and ſo oynions may be comprehended vnder garlyke. And Auicē in ye fore allegate place ſayth: That an oynion is ſubtile / percynge / and ſcourynge / with ſtipticite: and openeth ſtrongly: and is hotte in the thirde degree: wherfore it heateth yll waters / ꝓhibitynge / that they with their coldnes hurte nat the ſtomake: and hit makethe pure groſſe humours / cauſynge them lyghtely to penytrate. And vineger myxte with an oynion

dothe greatly fortifie his vertue ſubtile and penitratiue / and kepeth one from thyrſtynes / whiche oynions eaten are wonte to enduce. This ſame is verifiedde of garlyke. And Auicen ſayth in the aboue allegate place / that one ſhulde eate garlyke / after drinkyng of groſſe and troblous waters: for hit fyneth them / and maketh them lyghtly to diſcende: & lettethe that they hurte nat the ſtomake and entrayles: and that they ſtoppe nat the veynes. And garlykeis good eatē before one take his iourney. and after that hit is one of the beſte and moſt holſomeſt thȳges that can be / for them that come out of a colde aier or go in to hit: as Auicen ſaith .iii.i. cap. de regendo iter. And by this appereth that garlyke is ſpecially good for them that iourney and wander ouer dyuers countres / & vſe dyuers drynkes / accordynge to theſe verſes:

                  Allea qui mane ieiuno ſumpſerit ore.
                  Hunc ignoratum non ludit potus aquarum.
                  Nec diuerſorum mutatio facta locorum.
               
            
            More ouer garlyke is good agaynſt ye ſtyngynge of venomous wormes / & bytynges of ſerpentis / whan hit is dronken with wyne: whiche thynge Auicen in the .ij. can. and chap. of garlyke / ſayth / he hath proued. And alſo hit is good agaynſt the bytynge of a madde dogge: And a playſter made of garlyke / fygge leaues / & cōmyn / is good layde to the place bytten with a venomous beeſt called mugall. An oynion / as Auicen ſayth / the .ij. can. and chap. therof / is eke holſome for bytynge of a madde dogge / whā the place bytten is annoynted

with the ieuſe therof / or a playſter therof made with falte and rewe. And an oyniō eaten expelleth the hurte of venomous thynges. And ſome ſaye they engēdre in a mans ſtomake a moyſt humour very holſome agaȳſt ye hurt of venomous thȳgis. And here is to be noted / that garlike / oynions and alſo lykes are nat holſome for temperate bodyes / nor hotte / and ſpeciallye rawe. For they nouriſhe verye lyttell / and they nouriſhe yll / and engendre ſharpe prickynge bludde: yet they make ſubtile groſſe humours / and breake or cutte the clāmye. And after they be ſodde / they loſe the prickynge / and yet than theyr vertue inciſiue and ſubtilatiue remayneth. Therfore they be holſomer ſodde thā rawe. Lykes be hotte and drie / Eatyng of lykes. and their noriſhement is naughte / they hurte the eies / and engendre blacke melancoly bludde / & terrable dreames: they hourte the ſenowes with theyr prickynges: they hurte the tethe and gommes: and colerike & melancoly folkes ſhulde nat vſe to eate them / and ſpecially rawe. Oyniōs be hotte / Eatyng of oynions. & they haue an erthy ſuperfluous heate / with a wattriſhe moyſtnes / ſubtile / vndigeſted. If they be eaten rawe they engendre yll humours / and corruptable putrifactions in the ſtomake / and they cauſe yl dreames and dredful / and heed ache. And if they be to moche vſed / they marre the memorie / and trouble the vnderſtandynge / and make one beſyde hym ſelfe. But in caſe they be ſodde with the brothe of good fleſhe / & eaten / thā they cauſe good digeſtiō / and their hurtfulnes is diminiſhed / and they moderate

the coldnes of meates / where with they be ſodde:Eatyng of garlyke. but the beſte is / nat to vſe them. Garlyke is hotte / declynynge ſome what to humidite / but leſſe than oynions / hit is medicinable agaynſt vē
               toſitees / and the cough / and maketh one to ſpytte well / but hit hurteth the ſyghte and cauſeth heed ache: and hit is tryacle for vplandyſhe men. And thus the forſayde thynges / are holſome for them onely / that haue fleumatike groſſe and clāmy humours / but colerike folkes ought to abſteyn from them.The vſe of nuttes. The .ij. thinge is walnuttis: wherof Auicen .ii. can. cap. de nuce / ſayth: That it with fygges and rewe / are medicinable agaynſt all maner of venome / and therof / of oynions / & ſalte is made a playſter to laye to the bytynge of a madde dogge. And this ſpecially is vnderſtande of a drie nutte / taken before meate / in forme afore ſayd. And witteth well / that drye nuttes are worſe / than newe and moyſt.Diſeſes ē
                  gendred by eatynge of nuttes. For the drie are more oylye: by reaſon wherof they tourne to coler / and cauſe heed ache / they trouble the eies / and engendre ſwymmynge in the heed / and ſpecially taken after meate: they cauſe the paulſye in the tonge / and prouoke one to vomite / and make bliſters in ones mouthe: and they that haue a colerike ſtomake ought ſpecially to eſchewe drie nuttis: and the older they be / the worſe they be. The newe nuttis haue leſſe of yll oylynes / and therfore they engendre nat the ache or ſwymmynge in the heed / & ſuche lyke diſeaſes / as the drie do: and by reaſon of their ſlippery humidite / they make one haue the laſke. And if they

be a littell warmed at the fyre and eaten after dyner / they preſſe downe the meate. And thus it appereth ye newe nuttis are more holſome for folkes in helth than drie.Of rue called herbe grace. The .iij. is rewe. Wherof Auicen .ii. can. cap. de ruta / ſaith / that it reſiſteth poyſon. And after he ſaythe: If one feare leſte he drynke poyſon / or to be ſtōge of a venomous beſt / let hym take .3.j. of the ſede / with ye leaues therof / & drȳke it with wyne / and a nutte ſtamped and myngled to gether. And Ariſtotell in his boke de animalibus
ſaythe / that whan the weſill wyll feyght with the edder / or the toode / ſhe eateth rewe fyrſt and ſleeth the other: For the ſmelle of rewe is foo to poyſon. The eatynge of rewe in the mornynge with fygges & ſwete almondes / preſerueth from venome. Here is to be noted / yt there be .ij. kyndes of rewe.ii. kyedes of rue. The one is gardeine rewe / ye other is wylde rewe. The gardeine rewe is better than the felde rewe. For the felde rewe is excedynge drie. Hit is hotte / & drie in the .iiij. degree: wherfore it is hurtfull to take moche therof. The gardeyne rewe is moyſt hotte and drie in the .ij. and .iij. degree. It perceth and reſolueth ventoſite / and ſpecially / if it be drie. For Serapion in the chap. of rewe ſaith / that drie rewe of al medicins for ventoſites is the beſt / and moſt holſome: but moyſt it engendreth ventoſite. Alſo rewe vehemently quickeneth the ſyght / and ſpecially the ieuſe therof / with the ieuſe of fenell / and honye made in an oyntement orels eaten / as Auicen ſaythe in the .ij. canon and chap. of rewe. But yet for as moche as the ieuce of rewe hath a

proprete hurtfull to the eies / it were beſte to fanne wynde vpon your eies ther with: & in no wyſe to tuche your eies with ye materiall rewe. The .iiij. is peres:Peres. wherof Auicen .ii. can. cap. de piris / ſaith: that they be holſome agaynſt mortall diſeaſes engēdred by muſhroms or toode ſtooles. For peres / ſodde with muſhroms / do alaye theyr hurtefulnes. Orels this text may be vnderſtāde by peres aromatike / whiche by reaſon of their ſwete ſmell / comforte the ſpiritis and ſo repel poyſon. The .v. is radiſhes:Radyſhe coolis. wherof Auicen in his ſeconde canon / and chap. of them ſayth: that they be holſome agaynſt bytynge of a ſnake: and drōke with wyne it is good agaynſt the bytynge of ye beeſt cornute: and the ſede therof is good agaynſt all venomes. And the ſede of radiſhe layde vpon a ſcorpion / hit ſleeth hym / and the water therof hath in that behalfe ben proued / and it is ſtronger than the ſede: and if a ſcorpion bite one that hath eaten radiſhe / hit ſhall nat hurte hym. Hit is alſo verye good agaynſt chokynke of muſhroms. Or hit maye be ſaide hit is good agaynſt venome / bicauſe hit prouoketh one to vomite: and ſo by reaſō of vomite / the ſtomake is purged of yll humours. And here is to be noted / that radiſhe and radiſhe rootis are like of cōplectiō / whiche are vnholſom for colerike folke: for they engendre ſharpe prickynge bludde: and radiſhe is vnholſome for the ſtomake / for hit makethe one to belche / and engendreth groſſe humours. And if the digeſtiō be feble / hit engēdreth rawe humours: yet it is of a ſubtile and percyng

nature. But ſome men eate radyſhe after other meatis to comfort digeſtion: wherat Galen maruayleth. And counnynge phiſitions ſay / that if it be eaten after other meates / it helpeth digeſtion: and vnloſethe the bealye. But if radiſhe be eaten before other meates / hit lygftethe vpwarde the meate / and cauſethe one to vomite. But it is good to eate a ſmal quātite with vineger and ſalt / after other meate. Yet neuer the leſſe they hurt the eies and the heed. Raſis .iij. Alm̄. ſayth / that radiſhe / lyenge lōge in the ſtomake / voide fleume / the leaues wherof digeſteth meate / and helpeth the appetite / takē in a ſmal quātite. The .vj. is triacle / whiche of euerye ſorte is good agaynſt venome:Triacle. and therfore hit is good both for man and beaſte / agaynſt venome / as well colde as hotte. And vnder the name of triacle the noble medicine Metridatis maye be cōprehended: whiche .ij. be lyke in operation. For Auicen of triacle ſaythe:Auicē .vi.iiii. cract. iii. cap. i. Ye ſhall vnderſtande / that the greatteſt rule in curynge of venome is to comforte naturall heate: and to labour to dryue hit out / as triacle doth. And of triacle and the medicine Metridate to gether / Auicē .vi.iiii. tract. i. ca. de med. cōmun. Auicen ſaythe: There be certeyne medicines contrarie to venome: whiche will nat ſuffre venome to approche nere the harte / as triacle and Metridate.

And whan hit is changed / it dothe contrarie to the operation therof: And for a more declaration of the forſaide thingis / witteth well / that aier in the regiment of

For lyke as we ſe by exterior thynges / the fier without fannynge of the aier is ſchoked & quenched: ſo lyke wyſe we may imagin that the ſpiritis and naturall heate in man haue nede to noriſhe conſerue and attempre them. The attēperāce of natural heate is cauſed by drawyng of the aier / and his purgynge is cauſed by expulſynge of the aier. The fyrſte is done by motion of the attraction / & the ſecōde by motion of expulſiō. Therfore if we drawe in aier ſtynkȳge & vnclene / it corrupteth the natural heate and ſpirite. Therfore the aier ſhulde be of good ſubſtance / without vapours and miſtis. The aier ſhulde nat be troublous & cloudy / nor myxed with yll vapours.

Farther in the regiment of helthe / the aier ſhulde be eſchewed / whiche is myxed with vapours of lakes / and depe pittis conteinynge ſtynkynge waters: and of certeyne herbes / as cole

wortes / homlockes / and ſuche lyke: and of trees / as fygge trees & walnutte trees. Farther the aier is to be choſen / wherin the wynde blowethe from highe or egall gronde. And alſo we ought to take good heed / that the aier excede nat in any of his fyrſte qualitees / that is in heate / colde / moyſtute / and droughte / whiche if hit chance / hit muſte be tempered by craft as moche as is poſſible. Theſe thynges Auicen teacheth .ii. primi. doct. ii. de diuerſis.

            This texte teacheth one doctrine / whiche is / if a mā be diſeaſed by drȳkynge of wyne ouer nyght / He muſte on the morowe a freſhe drynke wyne agayne. For either drynkynge of wyne ouer nyght cauſeth dronkēnes / thyrſt in the mornynge / or inflāmation of the body. If hit inflāme the bodye / than hit is ryghte vnholſome agayne in the mornynge to drinke wyne a freſhe / for that were to lay fyre to fire: But if one happe to be dronke & there with parbrake a lyttell: than hit were holſome to drynke wyne agayne a freſhe in the mornynge. For the drynkynge of wyne agayne / than dothe lyghtly cauſe one to vomite / wherby the ſtomake is clenſed: For by that clenſynge / the hurt of drō
               kennes and parbrakynge gothe lyghtly awaye. And therfore Hippocrates counſayleth to be dronken ones a moneth: that of the dronkennes may come vomite: whiche thynge preſerueth vs from yll diſeaſes of longe continuance. If drynkynge of wyne ouer eue hurte one / and that by reaſon he

is nat accuſtomed to drynke wyne: than he maye drinke wyne in the mornynge / to accuſtome hym: and ſo the drinkynge of wyne ſhal leſſe hurt hym. For as Hippocrates ſayth / Hipp. ii. aphoriſmo. Ex multo tēpore &c. of a cuſtomable thyng cometh leſſe grefe. But in caſe that thyrſtynes in the mornynge foloweth on drynkynge of wyne ouer eue: than to drynke water in the mornynge / ſhulde coole his thirſt better. For as moche as we haue ſpoken of hurte commynge by drynkynke of wyne: witteth well / that a ꝑſone hauynge a feble brayne / and eke of what ſo euer other condicion he be / he oughte moſte circumſpectly to beware of dronkennes. For ofte dronkēnes / as Auicen ſaith:Auic. iii.i. ca. de regi. de aque & vini. Sixe incō
                  ueniences engendred of dronkennes. cauſeth .vj. inconueniences. Of whom the fyrſte is corruption of the lyuers cōplection. For wyne exceſſiuely taken / comynge to the lyuer / reſolueth the heate therof: wherby the lyuer loſeth his naturall generation of bludde: and in ſtede of blud / engendreth wattriſhenes / cauſynge the dropſye / or hit cuttethe the lyuer or the humours therof / wherby lepre or wodnes is engendred. The .ij. is / corruption of the braynes complection / throughe thycke and continuall aſſendynge of fumes of the wyne therto / diſpoſynge the hotte brayne to wodnes and freneſye: & the colde to the fallynge yuel / forgetfulnes / and palſey. The .iij. is weakes of the ſenowes. For we ſe that theſe dronkerdes / as well in youth as in age haue the palſey in ye heed / & other theyr mēbres. The .iiij. is diſeaſes of the ſenowes / as the crampe & palſey. For ſuꝑfluous drynkynge of wyne / oftymes tourneth to vineger

in the ſtomake / whiche hourtethe the ſenowes. Alſo often tymes / for faute of digeſtion / hit tourneth in to vndigeſted wattriſhenes / whiche mollifieth the ſenowes. And often tymes it enduceth groſſe humours to the ſenowes / wherby they be ſtretched out / or drawen to gether. The .v. is the palſey / through humidites of the brayne / encreaſed by the wyne: ſo yt they ſtoppe holly the wayes of the lyfely ſpiritis / procedynge from the brayne to the other membres. The .vj. is ſodeyne dethe / for whyle the dronkerde ſnortethe or ſlepethe / his wynde pipes / through abundāce of wyne / or humidites therof engendred / are cloſed / wherby he is ſodaynly ſtrangled. And though the immoderate drynkynge of wyne cauſeth ye forſaid incōueniēſes: Yet wyne moderatly taken / is holſome diuers wayes. And Auicē in ye afore allegate chap. reherſeth .v. bonties of wyne moderatly dronke. The fyrſte is / 
                  
                     •
                  . bonties of wyne moderatly dronke. that hit eaſely conueyeth ye meate / that hit is myngled with / to al the mēbres of the body / through the heate / ſubtillite / and hyd conuenient proprete therof. The .ij. is / hit digeſtethe fleume / and reſolueth hit throughe the heate and ſubtilite of his ſubſtance / makynge hit apte to auoyde out / openynge the wayes / and cōfortynge nature to driue hit out. The .iij. is / hit auoydeth redde colour by vrine / and by other inſenſible vacuations / as ſwette and ſuche lyke. And this is to be vnderſtande of claret wyne / or whyte / that is feble of his nature / or alayde with water: or elles hit wolde encreace coler / by tournynge it ſelfe in to

coler / and inflāmation of the lyuer. The .iiij. is / hit makethe melancoly / whiche is groſſe and moueth ſlowely / eaſelye to ſlyde by hit propre pypes / from the liuer to the ſplene / and from the ſplene to the brymme of the ſtomake: and at laſt / with the dregges / to auoyde out of the body. And hit declineth or repreſſeth the hurte of melācoly / through contrariouſnes of complection / and maner of ſubſtance / in the effectis therof. For melancoly engē
               dreth heuynes / feintnes of harte / & couetouſnes:Propreties of melancoly and of wyne. But wyne engendreth ioye / boldnes / ſtoutnes of ſtomake and liberalite. The .v. is / hit reſoluethe all cauſes of werynes / outcepte it be myxt with ſome other heate. For wyne reuiueth the reſolute ſpiritis agayne abundantly / and comfortethe naturall vertue / and taketh awaye or diminiſhethe humidites lefte in the muſculs / ſenowes of the harte / or in the ioyntes. And if the body dryed by werynes / nedeth moyſtynge / wyne moyſtethe hit quickely / ſo it be alaide with water. Farther more beſides theſe wyne hath many other good propretees. For aboue all other thȳges wyne is a ſwefte and a ſodaine nouriſher: hit comforteth the heate and naturall ſpirite / and heteth all the bodye / hit clereth the wytte / appeſeth anger / putteth away heuynes / and ſtereth to bodily luſt. And no drȳke digeſteth rawe humours ſo well. And wyne maketh one manlye bothe in ſtomake and body. And they that drynke no wyne are nothyng in regarde of theyr equals that drynke wyne / neyther in ſtomake nor corage.

            This texte declarethe one doctrine of wyne: and that is / the better wyne is / the better humours it engēdreth. The cauſe is / for blacke wyne is more groſſe and erthie than other: therfore the ſpiritis therof engendred be groſſe: Like as hit is proued by Gal. ſayenge before. Groſſe ſpiritis make the body heuy or ſlowe.vii. doctrines to cho
                  
                     •
                   wyne. And farther ther are put .vij. doctrines touchynge election of wyne. The firſte is / the wyne ought to be clere. For ſuche wyne by reaſon that hit is ſubtile / engendreth ſubtile and clere ſpiritis. The .ij. is / hit ought to be olde and nat newe. For newe wyne or muſt doth ſoner ouer come ones brayne / and make one haue the laſke / than other of the parell: hit engēdreth the colike / and other accidentis / that ſhall be declared after / whan we come to / Impedit vrinam. Nor ye ſhulde nat vnderſtande / that wyne ought to be to olde. For ſuche wyne / Auic. iii.i. ca. de regimine aque 
                     •
                   vini. as Auicē ſaith / is as a medicine / and nat as drynke. For ſuche wyne dothe rather alter a temperate body to heate and drought / thā nouriſhe it: hit is of ſmall noriſhemēt. For whan hit is ſo very olde / hit receyueth agayne hit fyrſte naturall verdure and ſharpenes / and is than all firye: wherfore the aggregatour / in the chap. de vite / by authorite of Galen writethe / that hit is hotte and drye in the .iij. degree. The .iij. is / that wyne oughte to be ſubtile. For ſubtile wyne maketh

the ſpiritis of mā ſubtile / and groſſe wynes groſſe ſpiritis. The .iiij. is / wyne ſhulde be rype / and nat vert or eger / orels hit wyll depriue man of all his naturall vacuations and good helthe / as Galen ſayth in the cōmēt of the canon .iii. part. reg. acut. And therfore hit is hurtefull for them / that wante euacuation by vrine and all other their vpper mēbres. Yet as Gal. in the ſame place ſaythe / ſuche wyne ſtypticall / is holſome for diſeaſes that chance in the guttes. Yet as Galen ſaythe there / the ſtypticalnes of the wyne wolde be put awaye by moche mynglynge of water. The .v. is / that wyne ſhuld be alayde with water: For therby the fumoſite of the wyne is put away: and ſo ouercō
               meth the brayne leſſe. This is treuth / if the wyne be ſubtile / but if hit be groſſe / hit ouercometh the brayne the ſooner: for therby it is ſubtiled & made more fumyſhe. And of this wyne Auicen vnderſtode whan he ſaide / Auic. 
                     •
                  ii.i. ca. de regimine aque et vini. that wyne alaide with water doth ſoner ouer come the brayne than pure wyne. The .vj. is / wyne ſhulde be ſprinkelynge / whā one taſtethe hit: and this is one of the condicions of good wyne / before ſaide. The .vij. is / taken of the drynkers condicion / and nat of the wyne: that is / we muſt drynke wyne tēperately: For wyne temperatly taken / ſharpeth the wytte / and engēdreth all the holſome thynges before declared. By all theſe. thynges here expreſſed we maye conclude / that wyne moſte to be choſen and beſt in the regiment of helth is meane wyne / egall betwene olde and newe / clere / ſome what redde / of good odour

and flauour / of egall ſauour / that is neither eger / ſharpe / nor ſwete: whiche is nat groſſe / nor to moche ſubtile: and eke that hit be nat to ſtronge nor to weake: and that hit growe nat on ſtony & hylly grounde / nor on ſimble plaine & earable grounde / but on highe grounde / lyenge open towarde the ſouthe / in a countrey nat to hotte nor to colde. And theſe thȳges are partly gathered out of Gal. iij.j. the place afore allegate. Touchynge the regimēt of wyne / cōcernyng the ages / the rules that Auicen putteth in ye aboue allegate place / are to be noted. The firſt is / to gyue children wyne to drȳke / is as one layde fire to fire of drie wodde. For chyldren be tender and ſoone enflamed / throughe thabundāce of theyr naturall heate / & their ſenowes and brayne be weake & feble. Wherfore wyne hurteth them many wayes. Firſt by quicke inflāmation / by ſtrykynge of the brayne / by lyghtly percynge of the ſenowes / and abundant fumoſite. Therfore whan one gyuethe wyne to chyldren to drynke / the flamynge heate of the wyne is added to ye flamynge heate of chyldrē bodies / whiche is of ſmall reſiſtence / as drie ſtyckes / reedes / or towe is agaynſt the fire. The .ij. rule is / that one gyue an olde man as moche wyne to drynke as he can beare without hurt / that is / as moche as his naturall and due appetite deſireth. For lyke as olde bootis and buſkyns that be drye and wrynkeled / are made ſoupull and playne with oyle / lyke wyſe ben the bodies of olde folkes by drinkynge of choſen wyne / as wyne of Beuuois. Auncient folkes

are colde / and wyne heateth / their ſpirite is heuy / and they be fulle of melancolye: but wynes maketh them mery / and repreſſeth melācolyes: and cōmonly olde folkes ſlepe yll / but wyne makethe them to ſlepe well. They be prone to opilations / but wyne openeth and letteth them. And ſo / lyke as wyne to children is moſte contrarie / ſo for olde folkes hit is moſt holſome. The .iii. is / that yōge folkes drynke wyne temperatly / temperately is / touchynge meaſurable quantite / and conuenient alayenge with water. And al though yōge folkes are as hotte as chyldren / yet they haue theyr mē
               bres more ſounde / the ſenowes and brayne more ſtronge / wherby they may the ſtronglyer reſiſte the hurte of wyne drynkynge. There folowe many good thinges of drynkynge wyne ſobrely / that is to ſaye / the voidynge of coler / the quickenynge of the corporall myght and wytte / and the abundance of ſubtile ſpiritis.
            
               Non ſit acetoſa ceruiſia / ſed bene clara / 
               De validis cocta granis ſatis ac veterata.
            
            This texte declareth .v. thȳges to choſe good ale by. Fyrſte that hit be nat ſower / for that hurteth the ſtomake. A ſower thynge / as Auicen ſayth in many places / hurteth the ſenowes / for ye ſtomake is a mēbre full of ſenowes / and that is touchynge the brynke. The .ij. is that ale muſte be clere: for troubled ale is a ſtopper / and hurtethe them ouer moche that haue the ſtone / hit fattethe and enflatethe and maketh one ſhorte wynded / and engendreth moche fleme. The .iij. is / ale ſhuld be made

of good corne nat corrupte / that is to ſaye of the beſt barly / wheate or 
                  •
               otis: for the better ye corne is / the better is the humour therof engendred. The .iiij. is / that ale oughte to be well ſodde: for it is the better digeſted / and more amiably receiued of nature: and the incōueniētis therof growyng / are the better borne. For ale nat well ſodde engendreth vētoſites in the bealy / gnawynge / inflaſiō / and colike. The .v. is / ale oughte to be ſtale & well purged / and nat ouer newe. For newe ale engendreth the ſame hurte that ale doth that is nat wel ſodde: and there with mooſte eaſilye cauſeth the ſtrayne coilion.
            De qua potatur / ſtomacus non inde grauetur.
            Here is taught one leſſon touchynge ye vſe of ale. That we muſt drinke it moderatly / ſo that the ſtomake be nat hurte therby / nor drōkennes cauſed. For hit is worſe to be dronke of ale than of wyne / and lōger dureth: the fumes and vapours of ale that aſcende to the heed are groſſe / wherfore they be nat ſo reſoluable / as they that be mōted vp by wyne. Where vpon it is to be noted / that in the begynnynge of dyner or ſoupper / hit is holſomer to drynke ale before wyne: the cauſe is / for at ye begynnyng of our repaſt or dyner / the body is hungrye: ſo ye ſtomake before we began to eate meate was hungrye / and ſo drewe ſuperfluites from the mēbres. Therfore if we begynne with wyne / for that nature greatly deſirethe hit / for the great noriſhemēt therof: the ſuꝑfluites / to gether with ye wyne drawen of the ſtomake / are drawen to the

parties of the bodye: but nature ſo deſirouſly draweth nat ale. Lyke wyſe ale waſheth ye humours hāgynge about the brymme of the ſtomake. And for this cauſe phiſitions counſaile / that whan one is moſte hungrye he ſhulde fyrſte aſſay to vomite or he eate any meate / that thoſe ſuꝑfluites drawē to gether of the hungrye ſtomake / may be voided out / leſte they be myngled with the meate. Lyke wyſe he that feareth to be thyrſty by ſuperfluous drinkynge of water / ſhulde drinke ale: For it quē
               cheth vnnaturall thyrſte.
            
               Temporibus veris modicum prandere iuv̄eris.
               Sed calor eſtatis dapibus nocet immoderatis.
               Autumni fructus caueas. ne ſint tibi luctus.
               De menſa ſume quantum vis tempore Brume.
            
            Here is determined what quātite of meate ſhuld be eaten / Diete after the .iiii. ſeaſons of the yere. after the diuerſite of the .iiij. ſeaſons of ye yere / whiche are ver or ſpringe tyme / ſommer / autumne / and wynter. He ſaythe that in the tyme of ver / we muſt eate littell meate. The ſame wylleth Auicen / & ſheweth the reaſon why / bicauſe / Auicē. ii.i. doct. ii. ca. vi. & .iii.i. doct. v. de reg. tp̄m cum recti auris. ſaithe he / in wynter mans body is nat greatly gyuen to labour and exerciſe / through prohibution of reſolutiō / rawe humours are encreaſed / and ſpecially fleumatike: whiche after the ꝓportion of the ſeaſon / thā ſpecially be engendred: whiche humours by reaſon of colde / are encloſed in the bodye. But whā ver or ſpryngetyme cometh / it cauſeth theſe rawe humours / gethered to gether / to melte and ſprede throughe all the body: wherfore nature is than greatelye occupied in digeſtynge of them.

Therfore in ver ſeaſon / if one eate moche meate / hit letteth nature to digeſte ſuche fleumatike humours / and ſhulde be diuerted an other way: for by theſe humours and great quātite of meate nature ſhuld be ouer preſſed. And ſo ſuche humours ſhulde remayne in the body vndigeſted: and runnynge to ſome membre / ſhulde cauſe ſome diſeaſe there. And therfore we oughte to take good hede / that we eate no greatte quantite of meate in ver. For diminiſhion of meate in this ſeaſon / is a ſpeciall preſeruation from diſeaſes reynynge in ver / as Auicen ſaythe .ij.j. the place before allegate. And this ſayenge is of a trouthe / from the myddes to the ende of ver / and nat in the begynnyng: for the begynnynge of ver is lykened to wynter: wherfore than one maye noriſhe the body as well as in wynter. And this alſo may be vnderſtande whan vere fynde the body full of humours / than meate is to be gyuen after the naturall heate and reſolution / that is cauſed of the body: for than the cauſe is auoided: for whiche meate ſhuld be diminiſhed. And the ſame willeth Hipp. j. aphoriſmorū / where he ſaithe: Bealies in wynter and vere are mooſte hotte / and ſlepe moſt longe. Therfore in thoſe ſeaſons / for the naturall heate is moche: therfore hit nedeth larger noriſhement. Secondly he ſaythe / that to eate to moche meate in ſomer is hurtefull: bycauſe than the vertue of digeſtion is feble: For the ſpiritis and naturall heate / whiche are the inſtumentes of corporall operation / are than ryght feble / ſparcled / and reſolute / throughe outwarde

heate / vehemently drawyng them to the exterior partis: and contrary wyſe / moche meate can nat be digeſted. And here is to be noted / that for the vehemēt reſolution of humidites / as well ſubſtā
               ciall / as mutrymentall of the bodye / groſſer and more meate in ſōmer ſhulde be eaten / if the night digeſtiue coulde digeſte ſo moche meate: but bycauſe nature can nat digeſte moche at ones / we muſte eate a lyttell / and ofte:The reaſō that one oughte to eate lytel meate in ſommer. as Galen ſaythe in the cōmēt of this Canon / Et quibus ſemel aut bis &c. In ſōmer we muſt eate many tymes and lyttell: many tymes bicauſe the body hath nede through ofte diſſolution: a lyttell / for defaute of digeſtion. And al though littell meate ſhulde be eaten in the ſommer / yet one maye drynke moche: for than is greatter reſolution and drought of the body: and the naturall heate of the bodye excedeth the moyſture therof: and man is more thyrſty than / than other tymes. But yet than one oughte to drynke leſſe wyne / ſpecially if hit be pure / for ſuche wyne ſoone enflameth / and cauſeth the naturall heate / hatte by the ardent heate of ſōmer / to burne / and therfore if we drynke wyne / we muſte myngle hit with moche water: and we muſte forbeare olde & ſtronge wyne. Thyrdly he ſayth / To auoide eatynge of frutes in Autūne. that in Autūne we ought to beware of frutes / ſpecially of ye ſame ſeaſon / as grapis / peches / figgis / and ſuche like: or at leaſte to eate but littell of them / for ſuche frutis engendre bludde / apte to putrifie / through the boyllyng that they make in the body & humours: & ſpecially if they be receyued in to an vnclene ſtomake

/ or a corrupt body / whiche for the moſt part chanceth in autumne. And ſo than / yll and fylthy diſeaſes are engendred / as the pockes and other peſtilent ſickeneſſes. Yet for a farther knowlege of the regiment of meate and drynke in Autumne / wytteth well / that in harueſt / hunger and thyrſte ſhulde be eſchewed / & to eate moche meate at one meale: as Raſis .iij. Alm̄ ſayth / cap. de reg. corporis ſecundum tp̄s. The wyne alſo that is dronke in harueſt / ſhulde be alayde with moche water / that hit may moyſt the bodye / and cole the heate: but nat ſo ſuperfluouſly alayde with water than / as in ſō
               mer: nor to be than dronke ſo ſuperfluouſlye: for thā nature febled / is nat able to welde and digeſte it: and to moche alayenge with water / wolde diſtroye naturall heate / & encreace vētoſites: wherby ye colike may be engēdred. Fourthly he ſaithe / yt in wynter we maye eate as moche as we wyll / that is to ſay / more thā in other ſeaſons / after the mynde of Auicen in .iij.j. the place afore allegate. And Galen ſayth / in the canon of the aphoriſ. E
                  •
                
               quibus ſemel aut &c. In wynter moche meate leiſerly ſhulde be eaten. The reaſon is bycauſe the heate of our body in wynter is ſtrongeſt / both by reaſon hit is conieled to gether / and fortified / by poſition of his contrarie / that is to ſay / the coldnes of the aier / enuironynge our bodies about. And this is verified in bygge bodies & fleſhie / and nat in bare and feble: for on ſuche bodies coldenes of wynter enclined doth nat cōforte with heate / but feblethe them more: For in wynter as Hippocrates ſaith:

bealies be hotteſt of nature and ſlepe moſte longe. Hit foloweth / that the groſſer noriſhementis and harder of digeſtion are holſomer in wynter than in other ſeaſons / by cauſe the heate is ſtronger. But the wyne that we muſte drynke than oughte to be ruddye as a roſe / and nat white / and alayde with a lyttell water. Here is to be noted / that all though / through the ſtrēgth of heate / and vertue of digeſtion in wynter / the groſſe and ſtrōge meatis are holſomer: yet bicauſe the ſeaſons than are diſpoſed to opilations and repletions / throughe verye moche fleme / hit were holſome than to vſe meane meates / betwene heuy and lyghte / groſſe & ſubtile / as kydde / veale / mutton / pikes / perche / and creueſſes. And they that vſe groſſer meates / as befe / porke / venſon / gottis fleſhe / & ſuche lyke / ſhulde eate but one meale a day: orels to vſe meatis laxatiue / as perſly / creſſis / muſtert / and ſuche lyke / and to vſe great labour.

The fyrſt is ſage / the leaues wherof put in to the drynke fordothe the hurte of hit / with it proprete / and alſo hit comforteth the ſenowes and brayne: whiche comforted / reſiſte the better the yl fumes / that of the yll drynke aſcende there vnto. The .ij. is rue / whoſe leaues holle without any bruſynge / ſhulde be put in to the drynke / for with hit heate & proprete / it fordoth the malice of the drynke. And howe good rue is agaynſt poyſon / hit hath bene

declared before at / Allea nux / tuta &c. And this text ſaythe / to the .ij. forſayde herbes / we may put the roſe flower. And this ſpeciallye ſhulde be vnderſtande of a red roſe: for the ſwete ſmell & ſtipticalnes therof / amendeth the malice of the drynke.

               A remedye for parbrakynge on the ſee.Here is put a remedye to auoide parbrakynge or ſpuynge / for ſuche as are nat accuſtomed to paſſe the ſee. He that wyll paſſe the ſee / muſte a fewe dayes before he take ſhyppynge / myngle the ſee water with his wyne. This is a remedye for the ryche: but if hit be a poore man / than he muſte drynke ſee water / that he maye eaſelyer eſchewe ſpuynge. The reaſon herof is / bicauſe the ſee water is ſalte: and ſo with his ſaltnes and ſtipticite / that foloweth ſaltnes / it cloſeth the mouthe of the ſtomake / and therby fordothe ſpuynge. And here is to be noted / that as Auicen ſaythe / a trauayler on the ſee / Auic. iii.i. de reg. iter agentis in mari. ſhulde nat moche go about to withſtāde or to forbeare parbrakynge or ſpuynge / at the begynnynge / but to vomite / vntyll he thynke hym ſelfe well purged: for that preſerueth from many diſeaſes / and nat only preſerueth / but alſo healeth or alleuiateth greuous & great diſeaſes / as lepre / dropſye / palſey / coldnes and ſwellynge of the ſtomake. Thus ſaythe Auicen .iii.i. doct. ii. ca. ii. But in caſe that the trauailer on the ſee ſpue ſo moche / that he therby is ryght greatlye febled / he muſt
                  •
                than reſtrayne hit by eatynge frute ſtypticall and ſower / as ben vnrype frute / crabbes / ſower pomegarnades

and ſuche lyke: wherwith the mouthe of the ſtomake is comforted / & humours expelled downe: and alſo the ſtomake therby comforted / driuethe away humours flowynge there vnto by toſſinge of ye water. Orels we may take muſterte ſede dryed by the fier / and drynke hit with wyne / or wormewode may be eaten or dronken / or a toſte wette in redolent wyne is good to eate. And generallye tarte meates be good for trauaylers on the ſee / for they comforte the ſtomake / and prohibite vapours & fumes to aſcēde to the heed / as herbes ſodde in vineger / or in the ieuſe of ſower grapes.

            This texte teacheth vs to make a cōmon ſauce if we lacke a better.To make a common ſauce. And .v. thȳges goth to the makynge of this ſauce. The fyrſt is ſage. Wherwith we maye make ſauce for a gooſe roſte or ſodde. For cōmonly a gooſe roſted or a pygge is ſtopped with ſage / to drawe vp the humidites and clāmynes of them / and alſo bicauſe the fleſhe ſhulde ſmell ſome what therof: yet after it is roſted / the ſage ſhulde be caſt away and nat eaten. Like wiſe of ſage vplandyſhe folke make a ſauce to eate with a gooſe: for they ſtampe ſage and garlyke to gether / that the ſage maye abate ſome what of the garlykes ſauour. The .ij. is ſalte with wyne: & this ſauce is for ryche and noble men. For whan they wante muſtert / or ver ieuſe / they put wyne in a ſaucer / & myngle hit with a lyttell ſalte. The .iij. is peper / vplandyſhe folkes ſauce. For they myngle peper

with beanes and peaſen. Lyke wyſe of breadde toſted / with ale or wyne / & with peper they make a blacke ſauce / as it were pappe / that is called peper / and that they caſte vpon theyr meate fleſhe and fyſſhe. The fourth is garlyke / where of the vplandiſhe people make a ſauce: for they myngle ſofte cheſe and mylke / and ſtampe garlyke to gether / and ſo eate hit with their meate / whether it be roſte or ſodde / ſalte or freſſhe / and with harde egges. The .v. is perſlye: the leaues wherof ſtā
               ped / with ver ieuſe or white wine is made a grene ſauce to eate with roſte meate. And here is to be noted / that ſauce or ſauces vary after the ſeaſons. For in hotte ſeaſons / hit muſte be made of colde thynges / or of ſtuffe of lyttell heate / and in colde ſeaſons contrarye wyſe. Therfore ſommer ſauce ſhulde be ver ieuſe / or eyſell / or vineger / the ieuſe of lēmons / or of pome garnades with roſe water and ſuche lyke. And other whyle in ſauces made in ſōmer / one may put a lyttell pellitorie & perſly / to attempre the coldenes of the forſayde thynges. But the mattier of cōpetent ſauces in wynter are muſterte / carloke / gynger / peper / cynomum / gelofers / garlyke / ſage / myntes / pelitorie / & perſlye: wyne water of fleſhe / vineger nat to ſtronge / but verye nere to the nature of wyne: And in meane ſeaſons / they ſhulde be mean / neither to hotte nor to colde. Secondlye ſauces differ by reaſon of the meates for whiche they be made: for one meate wil haue one ſauce / an other meate a nother ſauce: as lordis cokes knowe. Sauce for mutton / veale

and kydde is grene ſauce / made in ſōmer with vineger or ver ieuſe / with a fewe ſpices / without garlyke / with perſly / white gynger / ver ieuſe / and toſted breadde with vineger. In wynter the ſame ſauces be made with many ſpices / & a littell quā
               tite of garlyke / and of the beſte wyne / and with a littell ver ieuſe / or with muſtert. Sauce for roſted befe is made with peper / toſted breadde / brothe of fleſhe and grapes. And the ſame ſauce is good in wynter to eate with porke. Alſo porke in ſommer maye be eaten with vineger and perſlye in the begynnynge of our repaſt. But in caſe / the forſayde meates be baked / & ſpecially befe & porke / in wynter / than ſerue in a white oynion / and a ſmall quā
               tite of ſwete ſpice beaten in pouder. But in ſōmer without oynions / and with ver ieuſe / orels with a fewe ſmall oynions. But if the paſtis be made of more tender fleſhe and lyght of digeſtion / ſerue in ther with no oynions: but in ſōmer almon mylke with ver ieuſe / and a lyttell blanche pouder: and at the laſt ye may put therto / an egge brokē with ver ieuce. But in wynter in ſtede of ver ieuſe take wyne / and more ſpice. With roſted rabbattis and chekyns / ſauce made with cynomume / Dyuers good ſauces for ſondry meates crūmes of breadde / and with ver ieuſe in ſōmer is holſome / and in winter with wyne. For roſted porke take of the dryppynge / tempered with good wyne and oynions in winter: and in ſommer take the grene ſauce aboue named. For roſted feſantes / pigions / and turtyls / take none other ſauce but ſalte. For boylde capons and cockes take of the ſame brothe

with a lyttell blāche pouder. And preciſely if they be boyled with ſage / Iſope / & perſly / this is good ſauce in wynter: and in ſōmer / the brothe of the capon / and a lyttell vergis myngled to gether is a holſome ſauce. For fatte capons & hēnes baked / ſerue in none other ſauce / but a ſmalle quantite of blanche pouder: and at the ende the aboue named grene ſauce in ſōmer / and in wynter good wyne. But fiſhe the groſſer it is / the harder of digeſtion / the more ſuperfluous / and moyſter of nature / the more hit nedeth hotte ſauces and ſharpe: and the ſame rule is lyke wyſe true in all maner of fleſhe.

            Here are declared .ij. holſome thynges that come by waſſhynge of our handes after meate. The fyrſt is / the palme of our handes are mundified. The .ij. is / our ſyght is ſharped there by / and that is ſpecially by accidens / for the hādes be ye inſtrumētis to clenſe the eies: and hit is ryght holſome for them to be mundified: wherof we haue before ſpoken at Lumina mane manus.

            This texte toucheth .ij. thinges concernynge the choyce of breadde. The fyrſte is heate. For bread

oughte nat to be eaten hotte.Eatyng of hotte bread Hotte bread is hurtfull to mans nature: as Auicen ſaith .ii. ca. de pane. Hotte bread is nat conuenient for mans nature: and bread that cometh hotte from the ouen is vnholſome. The reaſō is / bicauſe it ſtoppeth moche. And agayne after he ſaith: Hotte bread throughe hit heate cauſeth thyrſtynes: and ſwymmeth by reaſon of his vapourous humidite: & is of quicke digeſtion / and of ſlowe diſcence. And all thoughe hotte breadde in the regiment of helthe be vnholſome to eate / yet ye ſmell therof is ryght holſome / hit relyuethe one in a ſownde: and hit is poſſible / that ſome folkes maye lyue by the ſmelle of newe breadde. The .ij. is / we ought nat to eate breadde very ſtale / or mouldy: for ſuche breadde is vnholſome for the nouriſhement of mans nature: for it driethe the body / and engendrethe melancoly humours: wheron hit folowethe / that bread ſhulde nat be to newe nor to ſtale / but a day olde. Farther the texte declarethe .v. propretes of good breadde.v. ꝓpretes of good bread. The fyrſt / hit muſte be well leuende / as Gal .i. alimentorum / ca. ii. ſayth: The beſte breadde for digeſtion / is hit that is verye well leuende / and baked in an ouen hatte with moderate fire. And agayne in the ſame chap. he ſaythe: Vnleuende bread is holſome for no body. And after the mynde of Auicen / Breadde made with littel leuen / Auicen .ii. can. cap. de pane. nouriſhethe moche / but the noriſhement therof is a ſtopper / outcepte they eate it / that labour moche. The .ij. is / that bread ought to be light / for therby is knowen / that the clāmynes is goone. Yet neuer the

leſſe this bread / after the mynde of Auicen / in the chap. and place before ſayd / is a ſwefte entrer / and of leſſe and worſe nouriſhemēt / as bread is / made of moche branne. The .iij. is / that bread oughte to be well baked: for breadde yll baked is of yll digeſtion / and engendrethe grefe in the ſtomake. And Auicen in the forſaide canon and chap. ſaith: That the bread yll baked / noriſheth very moche / but the noriſhement cauſeth opilations / outcepte they labour moche that eate it. And bread baken on a ſtone or in a panne is of the ſame faſhion: for hit is neuer well baked with in. The .iiij. is / that bread oughte to be temperately ſalted. For bread ouer ſwete is a ſtopper / & ouer ſalte a dryer. But bread moderately ſalted noriſheth beſte / ſo it haue the other conditions. The .v. is / that it ſhulde be made of the beſte grayne / that is to ſay / of ye beſte wheate. More ouer the texte warnethe vs to beware of cruſtis eatynge: for they engendre aduſt coler / or melancolye humours / by reaſon they be burned and drie. And therfore great eſtates / whiche of nature be colerike / cauſe the cruſtis aboue and benethe to be chypped awaye. Wherfore the pithe or the crūme ſhulde be choſen / whiche is of more and ſwyfter noryſhemēt than the cruſte. Yet nat withſtandynge cruſtis are holſome for them that be holle / and haue theyr ſtomake moyſt / and deſire to be leane / but they muſte eate them after they haue dyned. For they enforce the meate to diſcende / and cōforte the mouthe of the ſtomake. Farther / in the .ij. and laſte verſes is mencioned / 

that good bread ought to haue theſe .v. cōditions / that is / ye hit be ſalted / leuende / well baked / made of good corne / that is / that ye corne be pure / reapt / gethered / ſhefte / and houſed in due ſeaſon. And theſe conditions Auicen remēbreth in the forſayde place / ſayenge: Hit behoueth that bread be pure / ſalted / leuende / well baked / and a day olde. And here is to be noted / that if one deſire to noriſhe his bodye / he muſte haue his breadde made of pure flower / the branne clene taken out: if one wyll be leaner / leaue ſome branne therin. For branne noriſhethe but lyttell / and vnloſethe the bealye / and flower dothe contrarye wiſe.

            Here in this texte porke is compared to mutton. If porke be eatē without wyne it is leſſe holſome than mutton / but porke eaten with wyne / nouriſhethe beſte / and it is medicinable: for hit moyſteth moche. And is to be vnderſtande ſpecially of roſted pygges / and braune well dyghte. And here is to be noted / that porke / ſalted / or dryed in the ſmoke / ſuche as men of the coūtrey vſe / called bakon / are in no maner wyſe ſo holſome as mutton / whether hit be eaten with wyne or no: but hit is vnderſtande by roſted porke / or pigge / or braune / as is before ſayde.
            Ilia porcorum bona ſunt / mala ſunt reliquorum.
            This texte ſaythe / that hogge tripes / be better than of other beaſtis. The reaſon is / by cauſe we eate fewe entrayles / outcepte they be full of blud / 

and of verye fatte beaſtis / as hogges be. Nowe only hoggis bludde / through the complexion / and ſimilitude of complexion with mans nature / is bludde / of whiche the bowels be fylled. And lyke wyſe hoggis be ſoner fatte / than any other beſtis. Therfore we eate rather the tripes & chitterlȳges of an hogge than of other beſtis.

            This texte openeth .v. incōueniēces / that growe by drynkynge of newe wyne or muſte. The firſte is / that muſte letteth the vrine: and this may be vnderſtande .ij. wayes. Fyrſte / for groſſe muſte / throughe his groſnes / myxed with the dregges / ſtoppethe the lyuer and the raynes / ſo that the vrine can nat eaſely haue hit courſe. Secondly / hit lettethe the vrine of hit due courſe / as ſome reinnyſhe muſte doth / and certeyne other ſubtile wynes lyke wyſe: For there is ſome reynnyſhe muſt / that whoſe lyes are mordicāt or bytynge: & while hit runneth in to the bladder the erthye lyes byte and pricke the bladder: and cōſtrayne one to piſſe contrarie to the due order and maner that he was wonte to do. The .ij. is / hit loſethe the bealye / by reaſon that hit ſcoureth the entrayles / & through the ſharpnes of hit lyes / hit pricketh the guttis to voide out the ordeurs: fyrſte / through mordicatenes of the lyes. Secondly through vētoſite / whiche ſuche wyne cauſethe. Thyrdlye / by reaſon hit maketh ye guttis ſlyppry / by way of vndigeſtiblenes / and grefe of the ſtomake / wherfore the ſtomake

leuſeth / and openethe the wayes that were ſhutte. The .iij. is / that muſte hurtethe the good cōplection of the lyuer: For hit ſtoppeth the lyuer through moche mynglynge of hit lyes: and cauſeth diſeaſe in the lyuer called diſſenteria / through ſwellynge / wherby ye lyuer is febled. Thus ſayth Auicen .iii.i. ca. de reg. aque & vini. And thus it engē
               drethe an yll colour / and yll diſeaſes of the lyuer / that is to ſay ſpices of ye dropſy. The .iiij. is / that muſte hurtethe the ſplene and diſpoſition therof / throughe the ſame cauſe that hit dothe the lyuer: for hit ſtoppeth the ſplene: and ſo cauſethe it to be harde. The .v. is / that muſt engēdreth the ſtone: and ſpecially that is in the reines: whiche is ruddy / and lyghtly frangyble / by reaſon of opilation / that hit cauſeth by hit groſſe ſubſtance. And this is certeyne if the muſte be of very ſwete wynes / whoſe lyes be nothynge bytynge or ſharpe. For muſte / that hath ſharpe & bytynge lyes / preſerueth a man from the ſtone: for hit makethe one to pyſſe often: as ſome reinyſhe muſt / that cauſethe ſande or grauel to be ſene in the vrine: ofte prouokynge one to make water: whiche ofte makynge of water / waſſheth away the ſmall grauell / that cleueth to a mans raynes / and ſo auoydeth hit.

            Here are declared .ij. hurtes / hurtis that comme by drynkynge of water. that come by drynkynge of water. The fyrſte is / that drynkynge of water hurteth ones ſtomake that eateth: by reaſon that water cooleth and leuſethe the ſtomake:

and ſpecially hit diſtroyeth the appetite. The .ij. is / that drynkynge of water with meate lettethe digeſtiō / for it maketh ye meate receiued rawyſhe. After the mynde of Auicen / Auic. iii.i. ca. de reg. eiu
                     •
                   / quod comeditur. Auic ca. de regi. aque et vini. ſayenge: Nor after meate / moche water ſhulde nat be dronken: For hit deuideth the ſtomake and the meate / and cauſeth hit to ſwymme in the ſtomake. And he ſaith: And whan nature dothe digeſte meate / and that ſufficient quātite of water be myngled therwith / than after that / if we drynke more water / hit letteth very moche the digeſtion that was begonne. And agayne Auicen ſaythe:Auicen. ii. can. tract. i. cap. iiii. that drynkynge of water ſhulde be eſchewed / outcepte hit be to helpe the meate downe / whan hit ſtycketh or diſcendeth ſlowelye. But with meate water ſhulde neuer be takē or vſed. Auerrois in his cōment ſheweth the reaſon / whan we receyue water vpon meate / hit maketh the ſtomake colde or it be through hotte: and maketh the meate rawyſhe: and eke cauſeth the meate to ſwym in the ſtomake: and hit is the cauſe: that the meate ſtycketh nat faſt there as it ſhulde digeſt / as hit cōueniently ſhulde. The operation of the ſtomake is / to make a good myxion of thynges receyued there in / and to digeſt them well. That done there foloweth an ordinarie / and a naturall ſeperation of pure & vnpure thynges. And as a greatte quantite of water put in a potte ſlakethe the ſythynge of the meate therin: ſo lyke wyſe hit chanceth in the ſtomake / by drynkynge of moche water: But to drynke a lyttell quantite of colde water / with our meate / before it deſcende

downe in to the ſtomake / is nat forbydden but allowable / ſpecially if we be very thyrſty: for a littel quātite of colde wat / takē after ye forſayde maner / eaſethe the ſtomake and quenchethe thyrſte. The coldnes of the water enforcethe the heate of man to deſcēde to the very bottum of the ſtomake / and ſo fortifieth the digeſtion therof. Thus ſaith Auicē in the aboue allegate placis. But witteth well / that though water be more cōuenient to quenche thyrſte than wyne: yet wyne for a mans helthe is more holſome than water. And though water vniuerſally quenche thyrſte better than wyne / bycauſe hit is colde and moyſt / yet to make naturall and good cōmixion of meates / and to cōueie them to the extreme partis of mans body / wyne is better thā water. For wyne through his ſubtile ſubſtāce and operation / myngleth it ſelfe better with the meate / than water doth: and nature delyteth more in wyne than in water: therfore the mēbres drawe wyne more ſooner vnto them / mynglynge hit with the meate. This mixynge in this maner is as a boylynge or ſethyng of thynges to gether: whiche is greatly holpe by the heate of the wyne: but warer with hit coldnes / letteth hit. So than it appereth / that wyne in mynglynge with meate and delatynge of the ſame / is better than water. For wyne / by reaſon of hit ſubtilite of ſubſtance / and vertuous heate is a marueylous percer. And ſo by conſequens wine delateth or ſpreadeth more thā water / wherin is no vertuous heate / nor ſubſtance of ayre nor fire: the water letteth ye paſſage

therof. Farther / water is nat ſo holſome drynke as wyne: for water hyndrethe the noriſhement of the bodye: by reaſon hit nouryſhethe verye lyttell or nothynge at all: So that the more wattryſſhe that meate is / the leſſe hit noriſheth. Therfore hit is very holſome to drynke wyne with our meate: for hit doth nat hynder noriſhement / but greatlye fordreth hit: for wyne is a ſpeciall noriſhemēt and reſtoratiue / and noriſheth ſweftely / as hit is afore ſayd. Farther / ye ſhall vnderſtande / that to drȳke water with meate / is nat only hurtfull / but alſo in many other caſes / Auic. iii.i. ca. de regimine aque

                   vini. whiche are declared of Auicen. Fyrſte hit is vnholſome for a mā to drȳke faſtyng: for hit perceth in to the bodye by all the principall membres therof: mortifienge hit naturall heate. This is of trouthe / if one that is truely faſtynge drinke hit. Yet for a dronken man / it is ſome tyme holſome: nor it hurteth hym nat / though he drȳke hit faſtynge: For a dronkerde faſtynge is nat vtterlye faſtynge / his ſtomake is nat vacande / but ſome what remayneth of the other dayes ingurgynge. But in whoſe nitroſite / water dronke in ye mornynge doth mitigate: and the ſtomake / there with waſhed / & the vapours & fumes repreſſed / is diſpoſed to receyue newe ſuſtinance. The .ij. hurt is to drynke water after great labour & trauaile: and lyke wyſe after the fleſhely acte / betwene mā and woman: For than the poris of the bodye be verye open: wherby the water entrethe in to the bottum of the membres / mortifienge the natural heate. Whiche heate alſo after the fleſhely acte is

weaked. The .iij. incōuenience is after baynyng / ſpecially / if one bayne hym faſtynge: for than the cundites and wayes of the bodye be verye open: wherfore the water entrynge in hurteth / as is afore ſayde.Auicē .v

                  ma .ii. ca. vltimo. Of this drynkynge of water Auicen ſayth: That of water dronke taſtynge / after baynynge / and after carnall copulation / corruptynge of cōplection & dropſy is to be feared. Fourthly / it is hurtfull to drynke colde water to quēche feyned thyrſt / in the nyght / as hit chanceth to ſurfetters and drōkerdes: For by drinkynge of colde water / the reſolution and digeſtion of ſalte humours are prohibited / whether it be of wyne or other ſharpe thynges / cauſynge thyrſte: & ſo ſone after drynke thyrſte commeth agayne / as ſtronglye as before. But in caſe the thyrſte be ſo vehement / vexynge & vnquietynge ouer moche / that neither coldenes of brethynge / nor waſhynge of the mouthe with colde water / can ſuffice / than let the thyrſtie drȳke colde water / out of a narowe mouthed veſſelle or cuppe / or ſyppynge / that the water more ſlowlye maye come vnto the brymme of the ſtomake: for ſo hit ſhall beſte quenche thyrſte / and leſſe therof ſhalbe dronke / and than it ſhall nat vtterly diſtroy digeſtion. Fyftelye / generallye / hit is yll for holle folkes to drynke moche colde water / for hit quencheth naturall heate / greueth the breaſt / marreth the appetite of the ſtomake / and is verye hurtfull to all the ſenowye mēbres. Yet neuer the leſſe water temperatly colde ſome tyme per accidence / ſtereth one to haue an appetite / and maketh the ſtomake

            Here the author ſaith that veale nouriſheth very moche. And this Auicen affirmeth / ſayenge / that meate that conſerueth helth muſt be ſuche as the fleſhe is. For they are of lyke nature / & very apte to be conuerted in to bludde: and ſpecially kydde / yonge ſuckynge calues / and yerelynge lammes.

The fyrſte is an henne: the whiche is verye holſome to eate. For Haly / Auenzoart / and Meſue ſay / that the beſte fleſhe of pultry is an henne / that neuer layed / & of a cocke / yt neuer trad henne. For they without ſuperfluite are ſoone turned in to bludde: theyr proprete is to tempre mans complexion: and theyr broth is the beſte medicine that can be for lepers.

                   cane. The fleſhe wherof Auicen highlye preyſethe / ſayenge: There is no foules fleſhe better thā a turtyls or a hennes / nor ſubtiler. But yet they are nat ſo nouryſhynge as the pertriche. The .iiij. after the opiniō of ſome is a ſtare. This byrde ſhulde be eatē yonge. Some other call this foule Starna: whiche Raſis .iij. Alm̄ preiſethe aboue al other foules / ſayenge: A ſterlyngis fleſhe is lyghteſt of all other foules / & holſome for them that wyll kepe a ſklender diete: and by this maye be vnderſtande a greatter foule / as a grey gooſe / the fleſhe wherof / is ryght cōmendable / ſpecially yonge. And on this wiſe Almanſ. vnderſtandeth / preferrynge this fleſhe before other. Orels by a ſtare may be vnderſtāde / certeine ſmall ꝑtriches: wherof Moyſes ſemeth to vnderſtande / ſayenge to the Iewes: Lyke wyſe ſtares are vnholſome for our kynge / for they cōſtreyne and indurate the bealye. And this proprete ſome aſcribe vnto pertriches. For theyr fleſhe bynde the bealy / as witneſſethe Raſis .iij. Alm̄. The .v. is a doue / whoſe fleſhe is colerike. Whiche / as Raſis ſayth / is excedynge hotte: the whiche engēdreth blud feruētly hotte / and lyghtly engēdreth the ague. And therfore pigions be better baked with ſower grapis / than roſted. For by the ſower grapes / the heate engendred in the bludde is alayde. And the beſt to

eate be yonge pigions / redye to flie / for ſuche be of lyght digeſtion / and of better humour. For yōge pigions / nat able to flee / are ſuperfluouſly hotte & moyſt: wherby they engēdre groſſe humours / as Auicen ſayth the .ij. canon / & chap. of pigions. But olde pigions and theyr fleſhe / for theyr ouer great heate / drought / and difficulte of digeſtion / are to be eſchewed. And lyke wyſe olde turtyls. The .vj. is a quayle. Some doctours ſaye that a quayle is of light ſubſtance / and engendreth good bludde: and is very holſome for holle folkes. But after the mynde of Iſaac / quayles are worſe than any other wylde foule: nor they for nouriſhement nor digeſtion oughte to be preyſed. For throughe eatynge of their fleſhe the crampe is to be feared. As Auicen ſayth .ii. can. cap. de cotur. And he ſaythe the reaſon is in the ſubſtance of theyr fleſhe / that they engendre the crampe. And for this reaſon frenche mē bake & eate quayles with ſofte buttry cheſe. Yet by the quayle maye be vnderſtāde an other byrde a lyttell more than the forſayd ꝑtriche / of the ſame colour / with redde feete and bylle / of a delicious ſauour. And on this wiſe Raſis .iij. Alm̄ taketh a quayle / whā he preferreth ye fleſhe therof aboue the fleſhe of a ſtare / and all other foules. The .vij. is an oſell: whiche lyke wyſe ſhulde be eaten yonge. The .viij. is a pheſande: whiche of all phiſitians is nōbred for one of the beſt fleſhes. For the fleſhe of that foule is mooſte holſome for mans nature: and it is meate for princis & great eſtates. Conſiliator ſayth / that the wylde feſante

is beſte / both for helth and ſtrength. And alſo perauenture vniuerſally / ſeinge yt they are nere like vnto hēnes / and welnere of the ſame ſhappe. And they be drier of ayer and of fedynge / and larger of exerciſe. The .ix. is a wodcocke / the fleſhe of this byrde is ſpecially holſome. The .x. is a pertriche: whoſe fleſhe as Auicen ſayth / is ſubtile / Auicen .ii. can. ca. de cubigine. Galē .iii. alimētorū. cap. xvii. et .xviii. de iugenio cap. ii. & a great fatter / hit ſcoureth away the dropſye / comforteth the ſtomake / and augmenteth carnal luſt. Yet neuer the leſſe it is a bynder. And this fleſhe Galen preferreth aboue all other. And hit is ſayde that cuſtomable eatynge of this fleſhe / comforteth the memorie. The .xj. is a ruddocke / called robyn red breſt / ſhe eatethe grapis / and fleethe ſweftly as a ſtare doth / but hit nouriſhethe better than a ſtare doth: and they haūte moche aboute the vines / & they be dronke by eatynge of grapes / and they be beſt in ſeaſon to eate about al Halomas. The .xij. is orex / whiche as ſome ſay is a feſant henne / and as ſome ſaye a more henne: whether hit be a pheſant henne or a more henne / the fleſhe is of good noriſhemēt. The .xiij. is a byrde called tremulus: whiche byrde cōmonly abydeth nere the ſee coſte / leſſe in quantite than a henne / in colour ruſſet / hit criethe loude and fleethe ſweftelye / and whan his plumeth vpon the erthe / the tayle waggeth ſtyll / and therfore hit is called tremulus / and vpon the heed therof groweth lōge fethers. Hit is nat that byrde / ye pheſitions call a wagge tayle. The .xiiij. & laſt / is amarellus: whiche alſo is a water foule / lyke vnto a ducke / but hit is leſſe. And to ſpeake

generally / amōge foules to eate / they be beſt preyſed / that be ſwyfter in flight. And as the fleſhe of the forſaide foules are of a cōmēdable noriſhemēt / and of eaſye digeſtion: ſo lyke wyſe the fleſhe of ſome foules is of a diſcōmendable nouriſhement / harde to digeſt / and of vnegall cōplection / as the fleſhe of geeſe / pecockes / and malardes / and vniuerſally of al foules / that haue longe neckes / lōge bylles / and lyue vpō water. And the fleſhe of ſparowes / whiche are excedinge hotte / & vntēperate / ſterynge to bodily luſt. But touchynge election of foules fleſhe / ye ſhall vnderſtande / that theyr naturall noriſhynge muſt be cōſidered / that is whether they be reſtoratiue / lyght of digeſtion / lyght of ſubſtance / or of ſubtile operation: and ſo after theyr diuers propretes to preyſe them. Wherfore Galen beholdynge the eaſye alteration & ſubtilte of pertriches fleſhe / preferreth them. But Raſis with Iſaac / cōſiderynge the ſubtilte and lightnes of the ſtare / preyſethe that beſte. Iſaac alſo after the diuers intētions of wylde foules fleſhe / preyſeth diuers. Auicen commendethe turtyls fleſhe aboue other: either hauynge reſpecte to the proprete / wherby it ſtrengtheth and comforteth mās vnderſtandynge: orels yt in the countre of Araby / where Auicen was borne / turtyls are better than in other countreys. Farther wittethe well / that fleſhe of foules is more holſome / than of .iiij. legged beaſtis / for them that forſake labour / & gyue them to ſtudie and cōtemplation / for hit is ſooner digeſted: as Galen .iij. alimentorū ſaith: yet this

fleſhe of foules is ſoner digeſted than of beaſtis / & ſpecially of ꝑtriches / whiche engendreth cleane and pure bludde: diſpoſed to augmēt & to ſharpe the operations of the brayne / that is mās vnderſtandynge / cogitation / and memorie.

            This texte openethe .ij. knowleges in choyce of fyſhe. For either fyſſhe is harde or ſofte: if hit be ſofte / the elder the better. The reaſon is / for ſoftenes comethe of humidite: whiche in yonge fyſhe is vndigeſted / and in olde is more digeſted: and ſo whan ſuche fyſhes be yōge / they engendre fleme / but whan they be olde they do nothyng ſo moche. And ſo appereth / that an olde yele is holſomer thā a yonge / as ſome ſay. But if ſuche fiſhe be harde / than it is holſomer yonge / that is / ſoner digeſted / as pikes & perches be. For the hardnes reſiſtethe digeſtion. This is the opinion of Auicen .ii. ca. de piſcibus / ſayenge: Of harde fyſhes take the ſmalleſt: and of ſofte fyſhes / choſe the greatteſt.

            Here are reherſed .x. ſortis of fiſhes very holſome for mans body. The firſte is a pike / called the tyranne of fiſhes: For he nat only deuoureth fiſhes of other kynde / but alſo of his owne. On whom theſe verſes were made:

                  Lucius eſt piſcis rex & tyrannus aquarum.
                  A quo non differt Lucius iſte parum.
               
            
            The fiſhe of a pike is harde / and ſwyfte in ſwymmȳge.

The .ij. is a perche / diriuied of this verbe parco / parcis to forbeare or ſpare / by a clene cōtrary ſence / for a perche ſpareth no fyſhe / but wondethe other fyſhes with his fynnes on his backe: nor a pike dare nat venture vpon a perche: but as Albertus ſayth / in his boke of beaſtis nature / there is a natural amite betwene the perche & the pike. For the pike hurt of an other fiſhe / is healed with great difficulte. But whan he is hurte / he gothe vnto the perche / whiche ſeynge hym hurte / touchethe and ſokethe the wounde / and ſo the pike is healed. And the perche is like wiſe an harde fiſhe. The .iij. is a ſee fyſhe called a ſole / whiche is a ſpeciall good fyſhe. The .iiij. is a whytyng. The .v. is a tenche / Whiche is a freſhe water fyſhe / whoſe ſkynne is ſlyppery & ſlymely / ſome what blacke: the meate therof is harde. Whan ſo euer we wyll dreſſe a pike / a perche / or a tenche / we muſte take the ſkyn away. The .vj. is gurnus / whiche is a ſee fyſhe. This fyſhe is as greatte in quantite / as halfe a mans myddel fynger / the whiche is eaten with the heed and fynnes. The .vij. is a playce. The .viij. is a carpe / a freſhe water fyſhe / whiche is moche ſlyme: but greatte eſtates haue them ſoddde in wyne / & ſo the ſlymynes is done away. The .ix. is a rochette / a ſee fiſhe / and is a fiſhe of harde meate & holſome. Some other textis haue gouio / yt is a goien / whiche is very holſome fyſhe. The .x. is a troute / whiche in eatyng is like ſamō / and yet it is no ſamon / it is longe / and nat groſſe: it is taken in great ryuers / and wyll ſuffre it ſelfe

to be rubbed and clawed / beynge in the water / & ſo it is taken / & therof paſtis be made with ſpicis / and hit is a ryghte deynte fyſhe. Touchynge the choyce of fyſhe / ye ſhall fyrſte vnderſtande / that fyſhe / compared with fleſhe / is leſſe nouriſhynge / lyghter of digeſtion / and the nouriſhement therof is full of fleumatike ſuperfluites / colde / & moyſt: and they be hardely digeſted / and abyde longe in the ſtomake. And by reaſon the ſtomake laboreth in digeſtynge of them / and other whyle they be corrupted in the ſtomake / they receyue a certeyne putrified qualite / and engendre thyrſtynes. And ſurely the noriſhemēt of laudable fleſhe is better than of fyſhe. Secondly / witteth well / ye ſee fyſhe is better in regiment of helthe / than other of the ſame ſorte takē in freſhe water. For their noryſhemēt is nat ſo ſuperfluous / and is more nere to the nature of fleſhe. But bycauſe ſee fyſhe are harder than other of the ſorte taken in freſhe water: therfore they be of more difficulte in digeſtion / of more and pure nouriſhement. Yet nat withſtandynge / freſhe water fyſhe is holſomer for ſycke folkes / by reaſon of theyr feble digeſtion. Thyrdelye note / Cōditions of good fyſhe. that fyſhe / as well of ſalte water as freſhe / ſhulde be choſen / the whiche dreſſed are white / & nat clā
               my / but brittyll / nat verye groſſe / but ſubtile / nat of harde ſauour but ſoute / that doth nat ſoone putrifie / of good colour / nat bredde in lakes or pondis / nor in fylthy placis / nor in water wherin groweth yll wedes. And they oughte nat to be to olde nor to yōge / that be ſwyfte of mouynge / & of ſmal

clāmyſhenes. And if it be ſee fyſhe / we muſt choſe ſuche as is taken in ryuers a good waye from the ſee / and hauynge the other forſayde conditions: And the more ſkaly that fiſhe is the better hit is: and hit is lyke wyſe vnderſtande by the fynnes. For many fynnes and ſkales / betokē the purenes of the fyſhes ſubſtance. Alſo amonge ſee fyſhe / ye beſte be they that brede in the dippeſt water / that ebbeth and floweth. And therfore / the fyſhe that is taken in the northe ſee / that is more ſurgynge / and more tempeſtious / & more ſwyfte in ebbynge and flowynge / are better than the fyſhe taken in the deed or the ſouthe ſee. And ye ſhall lyke wyſe vnderſtande of freſhe water fyſhe: For fyſhe bred in depe water / is better thā other of the ſorte bred in ſhalowe & vnnotable waters. And here by may be ſufficiētly knowen / whiche fyſhe ſhulde be choſen / and whiche nat. For beaſtiall fyſhe / as the ſee ſwyne / dogge fyſhe / and dolphin / are vnholſome in the regiment of helth. For they be harde of digeſtion / and of ſuꝑfluous humours. Nor in the meate of the forſayde fyſſhes / the aboue nombred conditions appere nat / as whitenes / ſubtilite and ſuche other. And if thoſe fyſhes & ſuche lyke chāce to be eaten / they ſhulde nat be ſodde as ſoone as they be taken / but ſhulde be kepte a fewe dayes after: tyll tyme the meate of them mollifie / and waxe tender / without corruptynge of theyr ſubſtance. And alſo the forſayde fyſhes be better a lytell corned with ſalte than freſhe / or vtterly ſalte. And amonge all ſee fyſhe / the forſayde conditions

conſidered / the rochet and gurnat ſeme to be moſt holſome. For theyr meate and ſubſtance is mooſte pure / and than nexte a playce and a ſole. But the meate of thoſe is more clāmy / leſſe frangible / leſſe whyte / more groſſe / & leſſe ſubtile: nor the ſauour or ſmel of them is nat ſo delicious / and per chance the whitynge is more cōmendable thā the rochet. For hit is nat ſo groſſe and clāmy / as a playce and a ſole / and hit ſubſtance is frangible inoughe / but the releſhe / ſmel / colour / purenes / of ſubſtāce / and mobilite cōſidered / hit is nat ſo good as the rochet and gurnade: And lyke wyſe ye ſhall vnderſtāde of herrynge. And the fyſhe called morua / beynge yonge inoughe / draweth nere the forſayde fyſhes in goodnes / ſo that hit haue the aboue ſayde cōditions: yet hit is groſſer and more clāmy / than the forſayde fyſhes. But ſalmon / turbut / and mackerell / be nat ſo good: for they be moche groſſer / more clāmy / harder of digeſtion / and fuller of ſuperfluite. Therfore they be onely holſome / for laborers / and yonge folkes of ſtronge complection: theyr clāmynes / groſſenes / and coldnes / maye be taken away with certaine ſauces. Amonge freſhe water fyſhe / the forſayde conditions cōſidered / the perche and pike are the beſt / ſo they be fatte: and nexte are the vendoſies / and than lopſters. And though the perche be more ſkaly than theſe afore ſayde / yet the meate therof is ſo whyte / frāgible / and ſubtile / as the pike and carpe: and hit is ofte founde in pondes. And vniuerſally / the beſt freſhe water fyſhe of the ſame ſorte / is hit that is taken

in water ſtonye in the bottum / runnynge northe warde / depe / and labourynge moche / where into ronneth no vrdeurs of cites: and wherin no wedes growe. Creueces both of the ſee and ryuers / are moche nutratiue / and corrupte nat lyghtly in the ſtomake: but they be harde of digeſtion. Farther more note / that freſhe fyſhe moyſte the body / and encreace mylke and ſede of generation: & is verye holſome for colerike folkes.Eatyng of fyſhe good & badde. And after great trauaile or bigge labour / we ſhulde nat eate fiſhe / for than hit ſoone corrupteth in the ſtomake. And they that haue a weake ſtomake / or full of yll humours / ought to beware of eatynge fyſhe. More ouer / groſſe fyſhe / corned with a lytell ſalte / is better than freſhe fyſhe. And fyſhe of longe tyme ſaltynge is vnholſome. Alſo fyſhe & fleſhe to gether ſhulde nat be eaten: nor fyſhe and white meates: nor fyſhe ſhulde nat be eaten after other meates. Alſo fyſhe a lyttell ſalted / and in ſmalle quantite taken is holſome: hit ſtereth vp the appetite / and fortifieth hit / if one haue an appetite therto.

            The auctor ſayth here / that the yele is an vnholſome fyſhe / and ſpecially hurtethe the voyce. And this he proueth by the ſayenge of phiſitians / and ſtudentis of naturall philoſophe. The reaſon is / an yele is a ſlymye fyſhe / clāmy / and ſpeciallye a ſtopper: and wantethe moche of the cōditions of

good fyſhe before ſpoken. And this that is ſayde by an yele / may be vnderſtande of lampreys: all though lampreys be a lyttell holſomer thā yeles / and leſſe ieoperdus / ſeynge they be nat ſo clāmye and groſſe as yeles. And thoughe theſe fyſhes be delicious in taſte / yet they be verye perillous: for theyr generation in the water / is lyke generation of ſerpētes on the erthe. Wherfore it is to be douted leſt they be venomous: and therfore ye heedes and tayles / in whiche the venome is wonte to be / & lyke wyſe the ſtrynge within / ſhulde in no wyſe be eaten. Alſo hit is good to plunge them alyue in good wyne / to take away theyr clāmynes / and let them lye ſtyll therin tyll they be deed / and than let them be dyght with galentyne made of the beſte ſpicis / as great eſtates cokes are wonte to do. Yet hit is good to parboyle them twyſe before in wyne and water: and that brothe done awaye / to ſythe them through / and to make galantyne for them / or elles to bake them / or frye them in grene ſauce with ſtronge ſpicis / & a lyttell good wyne in wynter: in ſommer to dreſſe them with a lytell wyne / vergis & vineger: but he that can foreare theſe .ij. fyſhes dothe beſte. Farther the texte ſaythe / that cheſe and yeles hurte moche if they be eaten: and this is to be vnderſtande if ye eate great quantite therof. The cauſe of cheſe / is before ſhewed at Perſica poma &c. And of yeles here nowe before. Hit folowtth in the texte / that if thoſe thynges be taken with ofte drinkynge of wyne / their hurtfulnes is amended: & this ſhulde nat be vnderſtāde

of ſubtile and percyng wyne: nor of wyne that is gyuen in way of drinke cōductiue: for ſuche wine ſhulde nat be gyuen vpon meate / that engēdrethe yll humours / whan hit is eaten: nor before / nor after hit is digeſted:Auic. iii.i. ca. de regi

And here is to be noted / that there is .iij. maner of drynkynges. The fyrſte is that mynglethe the meate to gether: the .ij. that delateth hit: the .iij. that quencheth thyrſt. The fyrſt that we ſpake of is to be vnderſtande of drynke myngled with our meate / thoughe we be nat thyrſtye. Thus we

oughte to drynke euen as we haue eaten a lyttell. For outcepte a better reaſon / I ſay we may nat abyde tyll the meales ende / nor tyll we be a thyrſte. And this maner drynkyng is ſpecially good / for them that fede on meate actuallye drye: as apperethe by ſicke folkes / that eate drye breadde. But drynkynge to quenche thyrſte / for ſuche as be in good tempre / ſhulde be forborne tyll the meales ende: for than comethe the true thyrſte / throughe the heate of the meate hotte and drye. Hit is nat verye reaſonable that thyrſte and hunger ſhulde aſſayle vs bothe to gether: for they are of cōtrary appetite. and this drynke ſhulde be gyuen after as the thyrſt is more or leſſe. Drinkynge delatiue is moſte conuenient after the fyrſt digeſtion regularlye / and a lyttell before we take other meate. And this maner of drynkynge is holſome / whan the meates before taken were groſſe in ſubſtance: nor thus to drynke / we maye nat tarye tyll we be thyrſty. For this drinkynge prepareth ye ſtomake to receiue other meate: and cauſeth the meate digeſted to deſcende from the ſtomake to the lyuer: nor this drinkynge ſhulde nat be in great quātite: to thende hit may ſone be digeſted. For before hit be digeſted / hit goth nat to the lyuer. And this is of trouthe / outcepte ſuche drynke delatiue were water / in whiche one muſte nat tary tyll digeſtion before hit come to the lyuer. But regularly conuenient drynke delatiue or ꝑmixtiue / oughte nat to be water / but wyne / orels ale / bere / ſyder / ꝑtey / or ſuche lyke / than all whiche wyne is better. Secondly

wittethe well / that the groſſer / dryer / and colder that meate is / the bygger the drynke parmyxtiue and delatiue ſhulde be. And contrarye wyſe / the hotter / ſubtiler / and moyſter that meate is / the weake the drȳke ꝑmixtiue & delatiue ſhuld be. And the more ſubtile / hotte / and digeſtible the meate is / the weaker the drynke or wyne ought to be. Wherfore ſtrōger wyne ſhulde be dronke with befe / than with chekyns / & we ſhulde drynke ſtrō
               ger wyne with fyſhe than with fleſſhe. The .ij. doctrine is / that if we will eate an egge / hit muſt be rere roſtedde and newe: the cauſe therof is before ſhewed.

               Of peaſē.This texte reherſeth a notable thyng of peaſen. That is yt they ſome way are preiſed / & ſome way diſpreyſed. They be lauded whan they be eaten / the huſkes taken away / and diſcōmended / whan they be eaten with the huſkes: for than they enſtate. And therfore it is nat artificial to eate them in the huſkes / for the nature of that within & the huſkes / diſagree. The one labourethe to be loſed and to go out: the other withſtādeth / & byndeth / as Iſaac ſaythe in dictis vniuerſalibus. Wherfore a hurlynge mouynge is cauſed in the bodye / inducynge gnawynge and inflaſion in the bealye. And peaſen do nat this all onely / but alſo all pulce / as beanes / chiches / cheſtons / and ſuche lyke. And ſpeciallye ſuche as haue moche huſke / as beanes

and blacke ryce. Alſo the huſke of them all noryſheth worſe than the pithe within. And here is to be noted / that there is a maner of whyte rounde peaſen: wherof the codde is very ſmall & thynne: & one may eate theſe peaſen with the huſke more ſurelye than other / all thoughe hit were better to hulle them. And albe it that the reaſon afore ſayd is true touchȳge al pulce / yet ye ſhall vnderſtāde / that the hulles of grene pulce is leſſe / and leſſe diuerſite is betwene the huſkes & the pithe within / and more eaſye to digeſte: And therfore ſome ſaye they be more holſome for folkes in helthe: but hit is nat ſo: For grene pulce is of ryght great ſuperfluite and corruptible ſubſtance / wherfore they be leſſe holſomer for holle folkes. And note this for a treuthe / that drye pulce / the vtter huſke taken away / are more holſome than grene: but grene are better than drie vnhulled. Farther ye ſhall vnderſtance / that the ſubſtance of all pulce / is inflatiue and harde of digeſtion: and their yll nouriſhemēt is vnholſome in the regiment of helthe: but the broth of them is holſome: For the brothe of them maketh the bealy laxatiue / and maketh one piſſe / and vnſtoppeth the veynes. Wherfore hit is holſome at ſuche tymes as folkes vſe groſſe and opilatiue meatis / as on faſtynge dayes. For in this brothe or pottage conueniently made / are nat the hurtes that be in the ſubſtāce: therin is no inflaſion / nor difficulte of nouriſhement and digeſtion / nor the malice of noriſhemēt. This broth is made on this wyſe. The ryce or peaſen / muſte be layde

in ſythynge water: and therin a good whyle to be all to robbed with ones handes: and after in the forſayde water ſhulde be tempered all the nyght: and therin the nexte nyghte folowynge to be boyled twyſe or thryſe / and than dyghte / and ſo reſerued: And whan the houre of dyner drawethe nere / to dreſſe it with cynomum and ſaffron / and a lyttell curtſy wyne put therto: and than boyle hit ones / and ſo eate hit at begynnyng of our refectiō. And the brothe or pottage of ryce and of rounde white peaſon is better / and more holſome & frēdly to mans nature: and lyke wyſe theyr ſubſtance.

               To choſe mylke.Here the auctor teachethe vs certeyne leſſons to choſe mylke. The fyrſte is / that goottis mylke is holſome for them that be in a conſumption / or be leane / Auicenna ii. can. ca. de lacie. et i.iiii. tract. iii. ca. de remor. medic humect. echicos. or that haue a conſumyng ague. And Auicen ſayth / that goottis mylke and aſſis mylke are good for them that be in a cōſumption. The reaſon is / for that gootis mylke is temperate / and of moche nouriſhemēt. And nexte to this is camels mylke. For that is ſubtile / and of moche aquoſite & humidite: wherby hit may moyſt them. Yet for trouthe this mylke / throughe hit ouer moche humidite / nouriſhethe lyttell: wherfore hit is nat ſo holſome for them as goottis mylke: yet this camels mylke / newlye after folynge / is holſome for them that haue the dropſye / and for them that

haue diſeaſe in the lyuer: for it reuiueth the liuer / as Auicen ſaythe. Secondly he ſaythe / Auicen. ii. can. ca. de lacte. that aſſis mylke is holſomer than other / for drie folkes in a conſumption. This is of trouthe / comparynge aſſis mylke / with mylke of other brute beaſtis: for hit enclinethe to coldnes and humidite / and is ſubtile and ſoner entreth: and more ſlowelye conieyleth / than the mylke of any other brute beaſt / as Galen ſayth. The ſame ſaith Auicen / Galē. vi. de ingenio cap. vii. Auicen de lacte. and that after womās mylke / there is none to aſſis mylke. And he ſayth if any helpe the feuer ethicke / hit is aſſis mylke. Yet to compare aſſis mylke with womans mylke / hit is nat ſo holſome. For womans mylke taken by ſuckynge is mooſte holſome / as Auicen ſayth. The reaſon is:Auicen .i. quarti loco preallex. for womans mylke is colde / moyſte / more lyke to mans nature / ſwiftlier entred / quickelier digeſted / & more noriſhyng. And this mylke to be gyuen to them that be in a cōſumptiō / ſhulde be mylked as nere the paciētis beddis ſyde as is poſſible / & forth with to miniſtre hit vnto hym / leſt the ayer corrupte hit. And here is to be noted / that in ſome caſes / ſower or butter mylke is better for folkes in a conſumption / than womans mylke or aſſis. Fyrſte is whan by this feuer ethike / they be caſte in a laſke. The .ij. is / whan they ſuſpecte coagulation of the mylke in ye ſtomake / either by vehement heate of the feuer: orels by cauſe the ſtomake of hit ſelfe is colerike / the mylke ſhulde turne to coler. The .iij. is whan the ethike / is coupled with a putrified feuer: ſpeciallye whan there be nat many opilations in the

interiour partis. For ſower mylke reſtreineth the bealy / and turneth nat lyghtly in to coler: for the buttrines of it is gone: wherby the mylke lightly enflāmeth: nor in a putrified feuer / it is nat ſone putrified. The .iiij. is / if the ſtomake be foule / for thā the mylke corrupteth lyghtly therin. The .v. caſe is / whan he that hath the ethike diſeaſe / abhorrethe doulce & cleane mylke / but nat the ſower or butter mylke. The .iij. leſſō is / that cowe milke and ſhyppe mylke are more nutratiue / for they be fatter and groſſer than other / Aui. ii. ca. ca. de lacte for ſo ſayth Auicen: And that all beaſtis mylke / that in bryngynge forth yonge / continueth longer than a woman / is vnholſome: but the mylke of thoſe / that beare egallye with woman / is mooſte holſome / as cowe mylke.Raſis .iii. Alm̄. cap. de lacte. But Raſis ſayth: that cowe mylke is the moſte groſeſt mylke that any beaſt gyuethe: and therfore hit is holſomer than other / for them that deſyre to be fatte. The .iiij. leſſon is / that mylke hurteth them that haue ye ague / or the heed ache / The cauſe why is before ſhewed at Perſica poma &c.

               Thre propretes of butter.Here the auctor ſheweth .iiij. ꝓpretes of butter. The fyrſte is butter mollifieth the bealy / and maketh it ſlyppery / throughe it oylyues. The .ij. is / that butter is moyſte / for hit is made of the beaſt partis of the mylke / wherfore hit muſte nedes be moyſte / ſeynge that the mylke is moyſt / wherof it is made. The .iij. is / that hit leuſeth the bealye / and that is by the ſlypperynes that hit cauſeth in the guttis. Theſe .iij. propretes Auicen reherſeth

               ii. can. cap. de butyro. And theſe .iij. propretes butter induceth in a body / nat ſycke of a feuer: for it hurteth them that haue an ague / for butter with hit vnctuoſite augmentethe the heate of the feuer. Here is to be noted / that though butter cauſe the forſaide propretes: Yet by reaſon of it ouer moche humidite and vnctuoſite / it is vnholſome in waye of meate: ſpeciallye to eate moche therof. For if one vſe to eate moche therof / hit engendreth lothſomnes / and maketh the meate to ſwȳme aboute the brymme of the ſtomake: and laxeth the bealy out of meaſure / & cauſeth vomite. Therfore butter ſhulde in no wyſe be eaten as meate in greatte quantite / and ſpeciallye hit ſhulde nat be eaten after other meate: but to vſe hit with other meate / hit is very holſome.

            Two thynges are here touched. Fyrſte he puttethe .iiij. propretes of cheſe.Foure propretes of cheſe. The fyrſte is / that cheſe is of a colde nature. And this is to be vnderſtande of grene cheſe / whiche is colde and moyſt: and nat of olde cheſe / whiche is hotte and drie / as Auicen ſayth:Auicen .ii. can. cap. de 
                     •
                  aſeo. Orels hit may be vnderſtande by cheſe / that cruddeth onely of the mylke / without mynglyng of any other thyng. For there is ſome cheſe of hotte nature / that heatethe the ſtomake & byteth the tonge / by mynglynge of other thynges there with: as ſome cheſe grene in colour: of whiche if one eate moche in quantite / dothe heate and enflame the bodye. The .ij. proprete is / that cheſe maketh one coſtife: this is of trouthe / ſpecially if hit be harde / and made with moche renles. The .iij. is / that cheſe engēdreth groſſe humours: & this is trouthe of all cheſe: for all cheſe is made of the groſſer and more erthye parte of the mylke. The .iiij. ꝓprete is / yt mylke byndeth the wombe / and this and the .ij. is all one. Farther the texte ſaith / that though cheſe eatē alone be vnholſome / wherby cometh yll digeſtion / yet if one eate a lyttell curtſye with breadde / hit ſhall digeſt with the bread / and nat other wyſe: this is trouth / if holle folkes and nat ſycke eate hit. We ſpake before of cheſe at Nutrit et impinguat &c.
            
            
               Ignari medici me dicunt eſſe nociuum.
               Sed tamen ignorant cur nocumenta feram.

                  Qui phiſicam non ignorant hec teſtificantur.
            
            Here the auctour blameth them that abſolutelye reproue the vſe of cheſe. And he declareth .ij. vtilites therof. Fyrſte cheſe cōforteth a ſicke ſtomake. And here is to be noted / that al cheſe doth nat eaſe euerye diſeaſed ſtomake. But in other caſes all cheſe hurteth the ſtomake of ſelde knyttyng / and euerye ſtomake weaked by longe ſyckenes. But newe grene cheſe of ſmall clāmynes / cōfortethe a hotte ſtomake / for as Raſis ſayth: hit repreſſethe his brounes and heate. And eke hit comforteth a drie ſtomake / through it humidite. And olde cheſe or very tarte / or moche cruddye / hurtethe moche ſuche ſtomakes. But olde cheſe / or verye cruddye cheſe / comfortethe a ſtomake / where aboute hangeth moche fleme: for ſuche cheſe with his tartenes / cuttethe and ſcourethe away the fleme. But newe & ſofte cheſe hurteth ſuche a ſtomake ryght moche. And thus hit appereth / that in ſome caſe theſe hurteth alwaye / and nat in ſome. And that newe cheſe is ſome tyme good / & ſome tyme olde. The .ij. vtilite is / ye cheſe eaten after other meate / maketh hit to diſcende downe in to the place of digeſtion: that is the bottum of the ſtomake. All this they knowe / that haue the verye ſcience of phiſicke. And of tarte cheſe Raſis ſaythe: Neuer the leſſe a lyttell curtſye therof eaten after meate / fortifieth the mouthe of the ſtomake: and taketh away the ouer moche ſatiete & lothyng of meate / that are wōte to be engēdred of ſwete & vnctuous meatis / about the ſtomakes mouthe.

               Vt minus egrotes / non inter fercula potes.
            
            Here be .ij. leſſons. The fyrſte is / that a man at his meate ſhulde drinke lyttell and ofte. But this thynge is al redy declared. The .ij. leſſon / is that betwene meales / we muſt forbeare drynke: ſpeciallye if the meate that we dyd eate be vndigeſted in the ſtomake / excepte great neceſſite conſtrayne vs: for drynkynge than letteth and breakethe digeſtion of the meate fyrſte taken. For hit cauſeth the meate to diſcende from ye ſtomake vndigeſted: & putteth away the appetite: greueth the bodye / and engendreth the feuers and other diſeaſes.
            Vt vites penam / de potibus incipe cenam.
            Here the auctour ſayth / that one ought to begyn his ſoupper with drynke. Some expounde this verſe thus: If thou wylt eſchewe ſickenes / drȳke at ſoupper or thou begynne to eate. But this expoſition is reproued. For after phiſitians / a man ſhulde begynne his ſoupper with meate / and nat with drȳke. And all though this boke was made for engliſhe men / yet they kepe nat this rule: For at what houre of the day ſo euer they drinke / they eate a morſell breadde fyrſte. Therfore this verſe may be expounde other wyſe:Hippoc. ii. partic. aphonſm̄. takynge drynke for meate moyſte and eaſye of digeſtion / as Hippocrates taketh drynke whā he ſayth: Hit is eaſyer to fylle one with drynke thā with meate. So that the ſentēce of this verſe ſhulde be thus: It is better to begynne our ſoupper with drynke / that is with meate moyſte / and eaſye of digeſtion / than

with groſſe / harde / and yll of digeſtion. The reaſon is / if we eate meate moyſt & eaſie of digeſtion / after groſſe & harde of digeſtion / it wolde through the digeſtiue heate of the night / be ſoner digeſted longe before the groſſe meates. And whan it can nat haue iſſue for the groſſe meate vndigeſted: hit burneth ouer moche: or if hit iſſue / hit pluckethe parte of the groſſe meate vndigeſted with hit. Therfore it is beſte to begynne with meate moyſt and eaſye of digeſtion: that whan hit is digeſted / hit may without lette iſſue out.
            
               Singula poſt oua pocula ſume noua

            Here be certeyne leſſons. The fyrſt is / after the eatynge of euery newe layde egge rere roſted / we muſte drynke / and ſpecially a draughte of wyne. The reaſon maye be / by cauſe a newe layde egge rere roſted / is of ryghte great nouriſhement / and eaſely digeſted: and it is of that ſorte that in ſmal quantite nouriſheth moche: and principallye the yolke / as is before ſayde at oua 
                     ••
                  centia. So that the wyne / whiche is frendlye to nature / cauſethe that the egge is more deſirouſly drawen of the noriſhynge membres / and helpethe hit to entre. An other cauſe may be. An egge diſcendeth but ſlowlye: and drynke helpethe hit to diſcende. The .ii. doctrine is / to eate nattis after fyſhe / in ſtede of 
                  •
               heſe: For nuttis through theyr drines / hyndreth thingendryng of fl

               me / that is wonte to be engē
               dred of fiſhe. And for this cauſe nuttis are the laſt

ſeruice in lente. The .iij. leſſon is / that after fleſhe we muſt eate cheſe and nat nuttis: for nuttis drie ouer moche / and ſo doth nat cheſe: but it cauſethe the meate to diſcende to ye buttum of the ſtomake / where the vertue of digeſtion is. And this is certayne / if the cheſe be neyther to olde nor to newe. Farther the texte hath in ye laſt verſe / A nutte megge. that a nutte megge / is holſome for the body: hit makethe the mouthe to ſauour well / hit comforteth the ſighte / and lyke wyſe the lyuer / ſplene / and ſpeciallye the mouthe of the ſtomake / as Auicen ſaith. But the other cōmune nuttes / Auicen .ii. can. ca. de

                  ata. called a walnut / is hurtful. This walnut / as Auicen ſaythe / doth inflate / ingendre ventoſite in the wombe / hit is harde of digeſtion / and ſtereth one to vomite / & that by reaſō of hit calidite. But the .iij. nutte / that is the nutte of the croſſe bowe / is dethe / for the croſſe bowe ſleethe men. Orels we maye vnderſtande the nutte methel: whiche as Auicen ſaythe / is venomous / wherfore hit ſleeth.

            In the fyrſte verſe here / he lerneth vs to drynke wyne after peres. For peres (as is before ſufficientlye declared) engendre ventoſite: and of theyr proprete cauſe the colyke / and engendre blud fulle of aquoſite: and therfore with them one ſhulde

drynke ſtronge wyne: whiche conſumethe ventoſites and aquoſites engēdred of peres. Secondly the texte ſayth / that nuttis is a remedye agaynſt venome: as hath bene ſhewed at Allea nux &c. Farther in the .ij. and .iij. verſe he ſhewethe / that peres eatē without wyne are venomous / that is / hurtfull to mans nature / the cauſe is ſhewed in ye fyrſt verſe. Yet for al that peres be nat venomous ſimply / for if they were / they ſlee / and peres ſo doynge are accurſed. In the .iiij. verſe he ſhewethe / that rawe peres are venomous / that is: hurtful: for they make the humours to boyle / and cauſe ye colike / ſleme / & ſkabbe. Yet if they be ſodde / they be medicinable / in maner as is before ſaid / that is to ſaye with wyne: and ſpecially eaten after other meate: for ſo they expulce the dregges. In the .v. verſe he ſayth / that rawe peres greue ye ſtomake: for they let his digeſtion / and inflate: but ſodde peres releue the ſtomake greued: and diſpoſe hit naturally. In the laſt verſe are .ij. thynges. The fyrſte is after peres we muſt drynke / for the cauſe before ſayde. The .ij. is / that after eatynge of appuls / we muſte go to ſiege: for Auicen ſaythe:Auicen .ii. can. ca. de pontis. If ſwete or ſower appuls fynde any groſſe humours in the ſtomake / they force them to diſcende from thence to the guttis: for appuls are moche inflatiue and engendre ventoſites: whiche nature expelleth to the inferiour partis.

               Eatyng of cheries.Here are declared .iij. commodites / that come of cheris eatynge. The fyrſte is / that cheris purge the ſtomake. This ſome ſay is trouthe / whan the ſtones be broken and eaten with al: for theſe .ij. to gether / of their proprete ſcoure and clenſe. The .ij. is / that the kyrnell of the cherie ſtone / by his vertue / breaketh the ſtone in ones raynes or bladder: & is eaten drie or made in mylke. The .iij. is / that the ſubſtance or meate of cheries / engēdreth very good bludde / comforteth / and fattethe the bodye. And this is proued by experience: for we ſe that ſparowes / whiche are greatte eaters of cheries / that in cherie tyme theyr lyuers be farre greatter thā in other ſeaſons: wherby appereth that cheries encreace and cōforte the lyuer. Yet here is to be noted / that there be .ij. ſortes of cheris / groſſe / & ſmalle. And eke of the groſſe are .ij. ſortes / ſome are ſwete / and ſome ſower. All doulce and ſmalle cheris are vnholſome: for they lyghtlye corrupte / and brede vermyn. The groſſe and ſower cheries are called cina: and of theſe are .ij. ſortes: Some be ruddye and ſofte of ſubſtance: and ſuche muſt be eaten freſhe and newe gethered / and at begynnynge of dyner: theyr nature is to ſcoure the ſtomake / and to prouoke the appetite. The other are blacke / groſſe / and harde of ſubſtāce / and ſpecially the ſower. And theſe ſhulde be eaten at ye begynnynge of dyner or ſoupper. The cauſe is / for by theyr ſowernes they cloſe the mouthe of the ſtomake / wherby better & ſpedier digeſtiō foloweth.

               Here he putteth .ij. vtilites cōmynge by eatynge of prunes. Fyrſte / prunes coole the bodye: And therfore Portugals / that dwelle in a hotte coūtre / alwaye with theyr meate ſythe prunes. The .ij. prunes cauſe one to laſke / by reaſō of theyr humidite & clāmines: as Gal. ſaith.Galen .ii. alimētorū. Auicen .ii. can. ca. de prunis. This is of trouth if they be rype: for prunes yt be nat rype / be ſtypticall & noriſhe lytell as Auicen ſaith. And though damaſke prunes haue the forſayde vtilites / yet proprelye they be aſcriued to prunes of Armeny. For prunes of the countre of Armeny / are better than any other: And they vnbynde the wombe more vehemently than other / as Auicen ſaythe. For a more declaration / ye ſhall vnderſtande / that rype prunes are vſed / & nat vnrype.The beſte prunes. And prunes moſt holſome for mans nature be the longe ones / that haue lyttell ſubſtance about the ſtone / ſmall / harde / in maner drie / and the vtter ſkyn thynne: & they ſhulde nat be ſwete in taſte / but ſome what ſower / and of this ſorte are Damaſke prunes: and ſuche refreſhe and coole the body / as ſayde is. There be many other ſortes of prunes / whoſe vſe is nat accepted. There be alſo prunes / calledde wylde prunes / whiche growe in ye woddes: theſe be nat laxatiue: of them water is diſtilled to bȳde the wombe. Prunes that are taken to make one to laſke / muſte fyrſte be layde in colde water: for than they coole and moyſt more perfectly: and by ſlipperynes they leuſe the coler that they come to: and ſo the ſtomake is better diſpoſed to receyue foode. And here is to be noted / that moyſt prunes

and newe are more alteratiue / thoughe they be of worſe noriſhement / and of more ſuperfluite: but drie prunes cōforte more / and better nouryſhe the body. And as hit is ſayde by prunes / ſo after the maner is vnderſtande of cheris. Yet nat withandynge the humidite of cheris is ſubtiler and leſſe clāmy / wherby they noriſhe leſſe than prunes.

            Here be .iij. doctrines. The fyrſt is / that with peches we ſhulde drynke muſte / for .ij. cauſes: the fyrſte is / for muſt is hotte / & boyleth in our body: whiche boylynge and heate the peche with it coldnes fordoth. The .ij. cauſe is / for peches be ryght colde / and coole the bodye verye moche: Therfore that wyne ſhulde be dronke vpon them / whiche heateth more than other. But that is muſte / that is knowen by experience. The maner howe we ſhulde eate peches and other frutis / is declared at Perſica poma &c. The .ij. doctrine is / that with olde drie nuttis we muſt eate reſyns. For newe gethered nuttis are by them ſelfe holſome: but olde dry nuttis are greatte driers: & through theyr vnctuoſite they lyghtelye enflame the bodye: wherfore with them reſyns muſt be eate / whiche reſtrayne inflāmation & drynes / by reaſon they moyſt. And of nuttis is ſpoken more largely at Allea nux &c. The .iij. doctrine is / that reſyns of corans hurt ye ſplene / for it cauſeth opilation therof: yet they are holſome for the raynes: for by theyr prouokynge

of vrine they purge the raynes.

            Here be declared .ij. holſome thynges / that come by playſters made of fygges. Fyrſt / figges ſodde in water / & moyſte layde to any of theſe .iij. diſeaſes cureth hit / that is ſwynes yuell / kyrnels / and ſwellynges. By ſwynes yuell is vnderſtande inflaſion vnder the chynne about the throte. And it is called ſcrofula a ſcrofa / that is to ſaye a ſowe or a ſwyne: either bicauſe this diſeaſe chanceth many tymes to ſwyne through theyr guloſite: orels by cauſe ye ſhappe of this diſeaſe is likened to ſwyne / as Auicen ſayth.Auicen .iii.iiii. tract. ii. cap. de ſtropulis. By kyrnels are vnderſtāde impoſtumes / whiche cōmonly chance vnder ye arme pittis / and in the groynes. And by ſwellyng may be vnderſtande inflaſions in any parte of ye body. Wherfore to hele theſe impoſtumes / and ſpecially to rype them / figges ſhulde de ſodde with water:A playſter made of fygges. and with the water ſhulde be mixed a litell curtſy of vineger: whiche ſhulde helpe the vertue of the figges to entre. And whan it is ſodde / the fygges muſt be beate in a morter: and thā myngled with a curtſy of the water that they were ſodde in: and ſo make a playſter. A playſter is proprely a medicine made of ſome herbe / or flower / and the ioyce therof: as this verſe ſayth: Tunc cataplaſma facis / cum ſuccum ponis et herbam. The .ij. vtilite is / that a playſter made of figges and popie ſede ioyneth or ſetteth broken bones to gether agayne.A playſter of fygges & popie ſede. And they muſte be ſodde to gether in water wtout vineger:

and than ſtampe hit in a morter / and put therto a littell of the water that it was ſodde in: and ſo lay hit to the ſore. The reaſon herof may be: bicauſe popie ſede both taketh away the ſenſiblenes of the mēbres / wherby the ache / that is wonte to chāce in breakynge of bones / is done away / and prouoketh to ſlepe. Fyggis eke drawe the humidites of the bodye to the vtter partis: whiche humidites broughte to the bones / maye drawe / retayne / or holde them to gether / but neuer perfectely knytte them. And witteth well / that there be .iij. kyndes of popis / whyte / redde / and blacke. The redde is venomous / and growethe amonge corne. Yonge ſchole

Moche eatȳge of fyggis maketh one louſy: and this is for certayne / if the fygges be drie / as Auicen ſayth.Auicen .ii. can. ca. de ficubus. And he ſaith yt the cauſe is through the maliciouſnes and corruption of the humour of them engendred. And eke an other cauſe maye be / for that figges ſtere one to ſwete moche / wherof lyce are engendred. The .ij. operation is / fygges ſtere one to carnall luſte: and lyke wyſe they haue many ſuperfluites / and augmente the ſede of generation.

they make the dregges harde / and ſo the wtattrynes turneth in to moche vrine. The .ij. vtilite is / medlars make one coſtife throughe their ſowernes and ſtipticalnes / and therfore the texte ſayth / harde medlars be good to ſtoppe the laſke. But yet the ſofte medlars be better than the harde: for they noryſhe more and bynde leſſe. And here is to be noted / that medlars noryſhe leſſe than appuls / peres / peches / fygges / and ſuche lyke: whiche thynge apperethe playnelye by theyr egernes of reliſhe or taſte / & hardnes of theyr ſubſtance after they be ryped on the tree / and therfore we ſhulde eate fewe medlars / and rather in way of medicine than meate. And bicauſe they be verye ſtipticall / they be holſome for ye laſke. And bicauſe medlars ripe nat on the tree ſofte inough to eate / they muſt be layde tyll they be ſofte: and than they be more delectable and leſſe ſtipticall.

            Here the auctour toucheth .ij. thynges. Fyrſt he putteth .viij. propretes of ale or beare. Fyrſte / ale engendreth in mans body groſſe humours / whiche is of trouth in regarde of wyne. And after the diuerſite of the corne or groſſe ſubſtance the ale is made of / the groſſer humours are engendred. Secondly / ale augmentethe the ſtrengthes: and this doth ale made of the beſt grayne & wel ſodde: for by reaſon hit nouryſheth moche hit encreaceth ſtrengthe. Thyrdly / it encreateth fleſhe: by reaſon hit nouryſheth moche: and for the ſame cauſe hit encreaceth the bludde. And theſe .iij. laſte propropretes is in ſtale ale / well ſodde / and made of the beſte grayne. Fyftely / hit ſtereth one to pyſſe. Syxtly / hit maketh one to laſke. And theſe .ij. ꝓpretes is in clere bere / yt hath moche of ye hoppe / as bere of Amburgens / whiche by reaſon of the hoppes bryngethe one in a laſke. And hit is nat good for them that haue a weake braine. For this bere / by reaſon of hoppis doth lyghtlye ouercome the brayne. Seuently / hit enflateth the bealye: this is of trouthe if hit be yll ſodde: as Holande

bere doth: whiche enflateth moſt / and ſtoppeth / and therfore fatteth ryghte moche. The .viij. is / that a lyttell curtſye ale colethe. So dothe bere of Hollande / Brabande / Heynault / and Flanders. And this is hit that we vſe daylye. And this proprete is for certaine in reſpecte of wyne. Here is to be noted / that ale may be made of ootis / barly / & wheate. And as the grayne is altered / ſo is the cō
               plexion of the ale. Hit that is made of barly / inclineth more to colde / for barlye is colde. Hit that is made of barly and ootis / ſtoppethe leſſe / and leſſe engendreth ventoſites / and leſſe nouriſheth. And ale made of wheate malte / inclineth more to hete / nouryſhethe more / and ſtoppethe more. And the groſſer the ale is / the worſe hit is / the ſubtiler the better. Farther / ale made of thynges / that maketh one dronke is worſte / as of darnell. For this grayne ſpecially engendreth heed ache / and hurteth the ſenowes. Farther in the texte are .v. propretes of vineger. The fyrſte is hit driethe. For Auicen ſayth / hit is a ſtronge drier.Auicen .ii. can. ca. de aceto. Auic. iii.i. in ca. vnico. doct. v. And therfore phiſitians bydde in tyme of peſtilence to vſe hit with meate and drinke. For Auicen ſayth / he that vſeth vineger in his meate and drinke in peſtilēce tyme / nedeth nat to drede the ſickenes. The .ij. is / that vineger of it owne ꝓprete coleth. Thyrdly / hit maketh one leane / by reaſon that hit driethe. And this is for a very trouth if one take it faſtȳg / as Auicen ſayth. Yet neuer the leſſe / Auic. iii.i. doct. iiii. cap. v. cōtinuall vſe of vineger / ſpecially faſtynge / cauſeth many incō
               ueniēces: it febleth the ſyght / hurteth the breaſt / 

cauſethe the cough / hit hurtethe the ſtomake and lyuer / and vehemētly oppreſſeth the ſenowes / and ioyntes: them vexynge with arteticall grefes / tremblynge and ſhakinge. Fourthly / vineger engendreth melancoly / by reaſon it cooleth & drieth. Fyftely / vineger diminiſheth ye ſede of generatiō / for that hit coolethe driethe / and makethe leane. Theſe ꝓpretes Raſis putteth / ſayenge / Vineger is colde and drie / whiche maketh leane / diſtroieth the ſtrengthes / diminiſheth the ſede of generatiō / enforceth blacke coler / weaketh ruddye ſanguine coler / and makethe the meate ſubtile / that hit is myngled with. In the laſt verſe the auctour putteth .iij. thynges. Fyrſte / that vineger hurtethe leane folkes / by reaſon hit drieth / and hit tartnes maketh hit drie the more. For lyke ioyned to lyke / maketh ye one more furious. And eke eueri decaide complexion is holpe by the contrarye / and by the like / is brought in worſe caſe. Secondly / vineger hurteth the ſenowes / & thirdly hit maketh leane / as is before fayde.

            Here are declared .iij. vtilites of rapes tēperately ſodde / and one incōuenience of the ſame. Fyrſt / rapis comforte the ſtomake: for the ſtomake digeſteth them well / and is nat greued there with. Secondly / rapes breake wynde / as apperethe by experience. Thyrdly / rapes prouoketh the vrine. Yet beſydes theſe propretes / Auerrois ſayth / rapes

greatlye cōforte the ſyghte. The hurte of rapes is / the continuall eatynge of them hurtethe the tethe. In the laſte verſe he ſayth / rapis cauſe throwes or gnawyng in the bealy / by reaſon they multiplie ventoſites / as ſayth this verſe:
Ventum ſepe rapis / ſi tu vis viuere rapis.
The tayles of rapis leuſethe the bealye. Farther more note / that of all rootis / rapis do beſt noriſhe mans body / as appereth by the ſwetenes founde in theyr ſauour. For all ſwete meates nouryſhe more the body than ſower / bytter / or terte. Therfore by cauſe rapes be ſweteſte of all rootes / & leſſe ſharpe / they be moſte holſome in waye of meate: but yet they engendre groſſe melancoly bloudde / if they be nat well digeſted. And hit is good to purifie them from the fyrſt water / and in no wyſe to eate them rawe. They ſtere one to bodily luſt / and clenſe the wayes that the vrine ronneth.

            Secondlye he touchethe .ij. holſome thynges of ſalte. Fyrſt / that ſalte reſiſteth venome for .ij. cauſes. Fyrſt for that ſalte is a drier: and ſo with hit drines / drieth vp the humidites yt wolde corrupt. An other cauſe is / that ſalte drieth and ſupreſſeth the humidites / drawynge them out of the body / and ſo ſhutteth the poores / and conſequently ſtoppeth the entrance of venome / whiche is wonte to

entre by the poores. The .ij. holſome thynge is / ſalte maketh mans meate ſauorie. For cōmonlye we ſe no meatis ſauorie without ſalte / as ſaythe the thyrde verſe. Thyrdly ye auctour openeth .iiij. incōueniences of ſalte or meates to moche ſalted. Fyrſte / very ſalte meates marre the ſyght / for .ij. cauſes. The fyrſt is / that ſalte thynges drie ouer moche / whiche is contrarie to the eies / the inſtrumentis of ſyghte / for the eies are of the nature of water /

                  •

And amōge theſe talages there be .iij. hotte / as ſayth the texte / ſalt / bytter and ſharpe: and as Auicen ſayth / ye ſharpe is the hotter / and nexte is ſalte / and than bytter: for as moche as ſharpe is ſtronger to reſolue incidentis and ſcoure / than bytter. And than ſalte is like bytter / broken to gether with colde humidite. And of theſe talages .ii
                  •
               . be colde / eger / ſtiptike / & pontike. But pontike is colder thā the other: and

nexte is ſtiptike / and than eger. And therfore all frutes / that come to any ſwetenes / haue fyrſte a talage pontike / of a vehement coldnes: and after that by digeſtiue heate of the ſonne / the frutes be digeſted / there apperethe in them ſtiptiſite: and after they decline to ſowernes / as grapes / & than to ſwetenes. And thoughe terte be nat ſo hotte as ſtiptike / yet throughe hit ſubtilite and perſynge / is in many of more coldnes. And after Auicen pō
               tike and ſtiptike are in talage verye lyke: but yet the ſtiptike cauſethe the vpper parte of the tonge to be ſharpe and roughe / and pontike cauſeth the tonge to be roughe within. And .iij. of theſe talages are temperate / neyther excedynge hotte nor colde / as ſwete / vnctuous / & vnſauery: for though ſwete be hotte / yet therin apperethe no myghtye heate / as Raſis ſayth. And euery talage hath hit owne operations / as Auicen and Raſis ſay. The operations of ſwete ſaith Auicen / be digeſtion / ſokynge / and encreaſynge of noriſhement / & nature louynglye deſireth hit / and the vertue attractiue draweth hit. And after Raſis / ſwete engendrethe moche ruddye colour / and opilations of the lyuer and ſplene / ſpecially if the ſayde membres be apte there vnto. And therof foloweth ye flixe. Hit mollifieth the ſtomake / and comforteth the breaſt and lightis / hit fatteth the body / and augmenteth the ſede of generation. The operations of bytter / after Auicen / be ſharpynge and waſhynge awaye. And after Raſis / bitter heateth & drieth ſtrongly / and lyghtly reduceth the bludde to aduſt malice / 

and augmēteth ruddye colour in the blud. The operations of pontike talage / after Auicen / is contraction / if the ponticite be feble / orels expreſſion / if hit be ſtronge. And after Raſis / pontike cooleth the bodye / driethe the fleſhe / and diminiſheth the bludde / if one vſe hit ofte. Alſo hit comforteth the ſtomake / byndethe the wombe / and engendrethe melancolye bludde. The operation of ſtiptike talage after Auicen / are contrarie / thyckyng / hardnynge / and holdynge. And after Raſis the operatiōs therof are lyke pontike / though they be weaker: for he ſemeth to comprehende ſtiptike talage vnder pontike: for of ſtiptike he ſaythe nothynge expreſſely. The operations of vnctuous talage / after Auicen / are ſokynge / ſlipperines / and ſmalle digeſtion. And after Raſis / hit mollifiethe the ſtomake / maketh one laſkatyue / and fyllethe one or he hath taken any neceſſarye quantite of meate: and it heateth / ſpecially them that be vexed with a feuer: and that haue a hotte liuer and ſtomake. Hit moyſteth & ſoketh the body: but hit augmenteth fleme and ſlepe. The operatiōs of ſharpnes be reſolution / inciſion / and putrifaction after Auicen: And after Raſis encreaceth heate / & lyghtlye enflameth the body / and burneth the bloud / turnethe hit in to redde coler / and after in to blacke. The operations of ſalte talage / after Auicen / is to ſcoure / waſhe / drie / and let puttifaction. The operatiōs of ſharpe talage / after Auicen / is to cole and diuide: and after Raſis / hit refrayneth coler and bludde / and reſtrayneth the bealye / if the ſtomake

& guttis be cleane: but if there in be moche fleumatike matter / hit maketh the bealye laſke / cooleth the bodye / and eke weaketh the vertue of digeſtion / proprely in the lyuer. It hurteth the ſenowes and ſenowye membres / it drieth the body: but hit ſtereth vp the appetite. But of vnſauerynes operations Raſis ſayth / that ſome vnſauery thynge noriſheth well / & that is ſuche as is temperate. There is other ſome that heateth temperately / and an other that cooleth temperatly / and if moyſtnes be ioyned there with / hit moyſtethe / and with a drye thynge / hit drieth.

            Here are declared .iiij. cōmodites of wyne ſoppis. The fyrſt is / they purge the tethe / by reaſon they ſtycke longer in the tethe / thā wyne alone or bread alone: therfore the fylthynes of the tethe is the better conſumed / and the tethe the better purged. The .ij. cōmodite is / that hit ſharpeth the ſyghte: for it letteth the yll fumes to aſcende to ye brayne: whiche by theyr mynglynge to gether / darke the ſyghte. And this is by reaſon hit digeſteth all yll matters beynge in the ſtomake. Thyrdly / hit digeſtethe perfectly meates nat well digeſted: for it cloſeth the mouthe of the ſtomake / and conforteth digeſtion. Fourthly / hit reducethe ſuꝑfluous digeſtion to meane. All this is of trouthe / ſo that the breadde ſopped in wyne / be fyrſte toſted / or dried on imbers.

            Here are certayne doctrines. The fyrſte is / that hit is good for all folkes to kepe cuſtomable diete.To kepe diete▪
                And by diete is vnderſtande the miniſtrynge of meate & drynke. The reaſon is this. Breakynge from cuſtomable vſe hurteth greuouſly: for cuſtomance is an other nature: Therfore / as hit behoueth vs to kepe nature / ſo lyke wyſe hit dothe cuſtome: and ſpecially if the cuſtomable vſe be laudable. And as hit behoueth to kepe the wonte adminiſtration of meate and drynke: euen ſo hit behouethe vs to obſerue cuſtome in other thynges nat naturall / for the ſelfe reaſō. Wherfore if a mā wonte to labour moche / wyll for go this cuſtome & lyue ydelly: or labour moche leſſe: or go in hāde with other labour: or take an other tyme / or a noway: vndouted it ſhall ryght moche infeble hym. So in like maner it is in mans diete / in his ſlepe / in his watche / and ſuche lyke accidentis. For truly good cuſtome in all thyng muſt nedes be obſerued / if hit be laudable or indifferent in goodnes or hurtfulnes / in reſpecte of hit / wherto the change is made. And wytteth well / that they that be accuſtomed to labour / and exerciſe them ſelfe in any kynde of labour / all be hit they be feble or olde / hit greueth them leſſe / and labour more ſtrongly thā if they were yōge felowes / vnaccuſtomed / as Hippocrates ſayth .ii. aphoriſm̄. by reaſon that theſe feble

or olde perſones haue more inclination and cuſtome to theſe labours: For nowe the cuſtome before taken is lyghter / as is ſayde in the aforſayde aphoriſme. And this is the cauſe / why we ſe olde & feble craftes men / to do that ſtronger and yonger than they can nat do / and hit greueth them leſſe: as a feble olde mylner to lyfte a greatte weyghtye ſacke: A ſmythe to awey with greatter hammer labour / than a yonger mā nat therto accuſtomed. The .ij. doctrine is / that greatte harme folowethe change of diete / as Hippocrates ſaythe: outcepte hit be nedefull to change hit. Fyrſte hit is nedeful to change it / whā greuous diſeaſes ſhulde growe therby: as cuſtome to fede on yll meates / whiche at lengthe of neceſſite wyll brede in vs yl diſeaſes. Suche a cuſtome and lyke muſte nedes be amended and changed by lyttell and lyttell / but nat ſodaynly. For al ſodayne chāges hurte vehemētly / ſpecially from a thynge cuſtomable / to vnaccuſtomable. Secondly / it is nedeful to change / to thentent / it leſſe greue vs / if we happen to change our diete. For he yt vſeth hym ſelfe to all maner diete / ſhall hurte hym the leſſe. And this eke muſte be vnderſtande of other thinges nat naturall / for as Hippocrates ſaythe .ii. aphoriſ. A thynge longe cuſtomed / though hit be worſe than theſe we haue nat vſed / hurteth the body leſſe. Therfore hit behouethe vs to vſe thynges vnaccuſtomed. And here is to be noted / that euerye man ſhulde take hede / howe he accuſtomethe hym to one thynge / be hit neuer ſo good / whiche to obſerue were nedefull.

Example. If a mā cuſtome hym to one maner meate or drynke / or to abſteine holly frō them / or to ſlepe / or to knowe a woman carnally / it were very dangerous for hym / if he other whyle muſte abſteine from this cuſtome. Therfore euery body ſhulde be diſpoſed / to endure heate and colde / and to all mocions and noriſhemētis / ſo that the houres of ſlepe and watſhe / the houſe / bedde / and garmentis / may be changed without hurte: whiche thynge may be done / if one be nat to nere in obſeruynge cuſtome. Therfore other whyle hit behoueth to change cuſtomable thinges / Thus ſayth Raſis. The thyrde doctrine is / that the ſtronger and nere way in healynge a pacient / Raſis .iii. Alm̄. ca. de conſeruat. conſuet. is to miniſtre a certayne diete: For whiche if the phiſition doth nat care / and wyll miniſtre an other vndue diete / he fooliſhely gouerneth his pacient / and healethe hym yll.

And this diete is diuided in to ſklender diete / declinynge to groſſe diete: as the brothe of fleſhe / rere roſted egges / ſmall chickyns: and declinyng to ſklender diete / as mellicratum / & wyne of pome garnades: and meane diete / whiche is called certayne diete / as barly ieuſe nat bearen to gether. And this certayne diete is holſome in manye diſeaſes / but nat in all. Hit is nat holſome in longe diſeaſes: for in ſuche diſeaſes / the myght of ye pacient / with ſuche meane diete / can nat indure

to conſume the ſickenes / without great debilite: Therfore in ſuche diſeaſes / the meate muſte be ingroſſed. Lyke wyſe it is vnholſome in ſharpe diſeaſes / as theſe that ende within .iij. dayes ſpace or ſooner: for in ſuche mooſte ſklender diete is beſte / as Hipp. ſaythe .i. aphoriſ. there: The mooſte ſouerayne helpe is to diete the paciēt after his ſtrēgth and corporall myghte.

            This texte reherſeth .vj. thynges / to be conſidered of the phiſitian in miniſtryng of diete. Fyrſt / of what qualite the meate ought to be: for in hotte ſyckenes / we muſte diete the pacient with colde meate: in moyſte ſickenes drie meate / and in drye ſickenes moyſt meate. Yet the naturall cōplexion muſt be obſerued with diete lyke therto: For Gal. ſaythe:Ga. 
                     •
                  . teg. The hotter bodies nede the hotter medicines: the colder bodies / the colder medicins &c. The .ij. thynge is / of what ſubſtance the meate ought to be: For they that be ſtronge and luſtye / and exerciſe greatte labour / muſte be dieted with groſſer meate: for in them the way of digeſtion is ſtronge: & ſo they oughte nat to vſe ſklender meates / as chyckyns / capons / veale / or kydde: For thoſe fleſhes in them wyll burne / or be digeſted ouer ſoone: wherfore they muſte nedes eate ofte. But noble men and ſuche as lyue reſtfully / muſte vſe diete of ſklender ſubſtance: for in them ye vertue digeſtiue is weake / & nat able to digeſte groſſe meates: as bacon / befe / and fiſhe dried in ye ſonne.

Lyke wyſe they that be ſicke of ſharpe diſeaſes / oughte to vſe more ſklender diete / than they that be ſycke of longe diſeaſes / as a feuer quartane. The .iij. is what tyme diete oughte to be gyuen: for they yt be in helthe oughte ſpecially to regarde cuſtome. Wherfore they that ryſe yerly in ſomer / and eate but .ij. meles a day / oughte to eate about the houre of .x. or a lytell before: and nat to abyde tyll noone / bycauſe of the ouer great heate. Lyke wyſe they ought to ſuppe aboute the houre of .vj. or a lytell after. But in wynter they ought to dine at a .xj. of the clocke / or at .xij. bycauſe of the lōge ſlepynge: and than to ſuppe at .vij. a clocke / or a littell after. And ſpecially cuſtome ſhulde be kept. Tyme alſo in dietynge of ſycke folkes / muſte be conſydered. For they that haue an ague / whan it begynneth to vexe them / or a littel before or after / they ſhulde eate nothynge: for if one eate a lyttell before / or whan the fytte cometh: therby nature / that ſhulde entende to digeſt the meate / is diuerted an other way. If he ſhulde eate ſone after the fytte is gone / hit were vnholſome: for the vertue of digeſtion is very weake / by reaſon of the fytte paſte: Therfore he muſte eate ſo longe afore / as the meate may be digeſted or ye fytte come. Orels ſo longe after the fytte is gone / whan nature is come to due diſpoſition. This is of trouthe / outcepte ye drede great febleſhynge of nature: for thā at al tymes he muſte eate. For whan ſo euer mās ſtrengthe be febliſhed by any chances / he ſhulde eate forth with as ſaith Galen / in the gloſe of this

aphoriſ. Contēplari autē &c. Fourthly / the quantite of the meate muſt be conſidered: For as hit is before ſayde / in ſomer we muſte vſe a ſmall quantite of meate / at euerye meale: for than the naturall heate is feble through the ouer great reſolutions. But in wynter we may eate a great dele of meate at a meale. For thā the vertue digeſtiue is ſtrōge / whan the naturall heate is vnied / through circū
               ſtant colde as we ſayde at Temporibus veris &c. The .v. is / howe ofte we ſhulde eate in a day: For in ſomer we muſte eate oftener than in wynter: in autumpne and ver a lyttell at eche meale / as is before ſaide. Lyke wyſe / if the vertue digeſtiue be weake / we muſte eate lyttell and ofte: but if the vertue digeſtiue be ſtronge / we may eate moche / & make fewe meales. Syxtlye / the eatynge place muſt be conſidered: whiche ſhulde nat be to hotte nor to colde / but temperate.

            This texte declareth .iij. thynges. The fyrſt is / that the brothe of colewortis / and ſpeciallye the fyrſte brothe if they be ſodde / leuſeth the bealy: by reaſon that in the leaues and vtter partis of colewortis / is a ſopy ſcourynge vertue / weakely cleuynge / and lyghtly ſeparable by ſmall decoction or boylynge: whiche ſpredde abrode by the ſame water is made laxatiue. And this is ye ſkele that the fyrſt water colewortis be ſodde in / laxe rather than the ſeconde. The .ij. is / that the ſubſtance of colewortes / after they are boyled / reſtrayneth the

bealy: by reaſon that all theyr vertue laxatiue is taken away by the decoction: and the erthye drie ſubſtance remayneth / whiche byndeth ye wombe. The .iij. is / that bothe taken to gether / the brothe and ſubſtance of colewortis / leuſe the bealye: by reaſon the ſcourynge ſopy vertue remayneth in ye water / whiche leuſeth all. And note that colewortis engendre melancoly humours / & yll dreames / they hurte the ſtomake / noriſhe lyttell / duſke the ſyght / cauſe one to dreame / & they prouoke menſtruoſite and vrine / as Auicen and Raſis ſaye. Farther more note / that colewortis / the decoction or ſede therof / kepe one from dronkennes / as wryteth Ariſtottell .iii. partic. problem. aſkynge for what ſkele colewortis kepe one from dronkennes. And this thynge is affirmed of Auicen and Raſis. The reaſon / as ſome thynke / is the groſſe fumes / Auicen .ii. canone. Raſis .iii. Almanſol. that by eatynge of colewortis are lyfted vp to the brayne / engroſſynge the fumoſites of the wyne / whiche engroſſynge let them to entre to ye brayne. Ariſtotell in the forſayd place ſayth / that al thȳge that draweth to hit the moyſtnes of the wyne / expellethe hit from the body / and that coleth the body / kepeth hit from dronkennes: cole wortes are of ſuche nature / ergo &c. And that colewortis are of this nature / he prouethe thus: By the ieuſe of colewortis / the vndigeſted humidites of ye wyne / are drawen from all the bodye in to the bladder: and through it coldnes lefte in the ſtomake / whiche coleth all the body / the perſynge therof is fordone. And ſo by this meane it kepethe a mā ſobre.

For the ſubtile ſuperfluites that naturally coude nat diſcende / by reaſon the heate of the wyne ſtereth them to aſcende vpwarde towarde ye brayne: are repreſſed downe / and by vertue of this ieuſe drawen to the bladder.

Thyrdly thautour reherſeth .vj. medicines good for the palley. Hit is ſayd / that ſage / caſtorie / that is a caſtors ſtones / lauander / primeroſe / wattercreſſe / and tanſey / cure and heale membres enfect with palſey. Why ſage doth helpe it we haue ſhewed / for hit cōforteth ye ſenowes / whiche by palſey be weaked. And eke bicauſe ſage is hotte & drie / it conſumeth the flematike matter remaynynge in the ſenowes / wherof ye palſey groweth. And that caſtorie is holſome for the palſey appereth by that hit is mooſte comfortable / heatynge and dryenge of the ſenowes: For Auicen ſayth therof / Auicen .ii. can. ca. de caſtoreo. that hit is ſubtiler and ſtronger than any other that heateth and drieth. And after he ſayth / that hit comforteth and heateth the ſenowes / the ſhakynge / the moiſt crampe / and benomed membres cauſed of the palſey. And eke he ſayth: there is nothyng better for ventoſite in the eare / thā to take as moche as a peaſe / and tempre it with oyle of ſpike / & ſo let it droppe in to the eare. Caſtorie hath many other vertues whiche Auicē reherſeth. Caſtoriū is the ſtones of a ſee beaſte called caſtor. The oyle alſo of Caſtorie is as ſpecially good for the palſey / as caſtorie after voidynge of the matter: for than hit conſumeth the reſydue of the mattier that remayneth / & comforteth the ſenowes.

And alſo of the primeroſe eke appereth / for with hit ſwete ſauour and heate / hit comfortethe the ſenowes. This flower is called premula veris / bicauſe hit is the fyrſte ſwete flower that ſpryngeth in ver. The .v. is a watter creſſe / for hit is hotte / drie / ſubtile / inciſiue / and reſolutiue: wherby it taketh away ye mattier of palſey / And Auicen ſaith / hit comforteth all mollification of the ſenowes / for hit heateth / and drawethe out fleme / and clenſeth the ſenowes from fleme: and phiſitians coūſaile vs to eate water creſſis in lent bicauſe lenten meate is flematike. Watercreſſe is a cōmō herbe growyng in colde / ſtony / & watriſhe places / where as be many wel ſpringes.

The .ij. is / rewe diminiſhethe ye deſire of carnall luſt in men / but in women rewe augmenteth hit: by reaſon that rue by hit heatynge & dryenge diminiſheth the ſede of mē / whiche is ſubtile and of the nature of the ayre / but in women rue maketh ſubtile and heatethe the ſede: for in them hit is wattriſhe and colde: and therfore hit ſterethe them more to carnall luſte. The .iij. is / rewe maketh a man quicke / ſubtile / and inuentife: by reaſon that by heatynge and dryenge / hit maketh a mans ſpiritis ſubtile / and ſo clerethe the wytte. The .iiij. is / that the water that rue is ſodde in / To kylle flees. caſt and ſprinkeled about the houſe / riddeth away flees / and as phiſitions ſay / it kylleth them. And after Auicen: whan the houſe is ſprinkeled with the water of wylde gourdes / the flees lepe & flee away: And lyke wyſe doth the water that blacke thorne is ſodde in. And after Auicen ſaythe / Auicē .vi.iiii. tract. iii. cap. de effug. pulicum. that ſome haue ſayde / if goottis bludde be put in a pyt in the houſe / the flees wyll gether there vnto and dye. And lyke wyſe if a logge be annoynted with the greace of an yrchyn / ye flees wyll gether therto and dye. Flees can nat abyde the ſauour of colewortis / nor leaues of Oleandre. Some ſay / that nothynge is better to auoyde flees than thynges of ſtronge ſauour: & therfore rewe / myntis / horſe myntis / and hoppis be good / and aboue all thyngis horſe dounge orels hors ſtale is the chiefe.

Alſo the houſe ſpryncled with ye decoction of rape ſede kylleth flees. And the parfumyng of ye houſe with a bulles horne / driuethe awaye flees. Yet to take flees / nothynge is better / than to lay blankettis on the bed / for therin they gether them ſelf.

               Here the auctour ſpeaketh of oynions / and declareth .v. thynges. Fyrſte / touchynge theyr operation phiſitions agree nat: For ſome ſaye they be good for flematike folkes: and ſome ſay naye / as Raſis / whiche ſayth / that they engēdre ſuperfluous and flematyke humours in the ſtomake. Secondly / Galen ſaythe / they be ryghte hurtfull for colerike folkes: bicauſe as Auicē ſaith / oyniōs be hotte in the thyrde degree: and therfore they hurt hotte folkes / as colerike be. Thirdly oyniōs be holſome for flematike folkes: For they be hot / perſynge / ſubtile / ſcourynge / and openyng / wherfore they digeſt / cutte / make ſubtile / and wype away fleumatike and clāmy humours / growen in the fleumatike folkes. Fourthly / oynions be holſome for the ſtomake / for they mundifie hit from fleme / and heate hit. And therfore Auicen ſaithe / that hit / that is eate of the oynion / throughe the heate therof comfortethe a weake ſtomake. And eke therfore they make a man well colered: For it

is impoſſible for one to haue a lyuelye coler / if his ſtomake be verye fleumatike / or fylled with yll / rawe / & flematike humours. The .v. is / oynions ſodde and ſtamped / reſtore heares agayne / if the place where ye heares were / be rubbed therwith. This is of trouthe / whan the heare gothe awaye throughe ſtoppynge of the pores / and corruption of the mattier vnder the ſkynne. For the oynions open the pores / & reſolue the yll mattier vnder ye ſkynne / & drawe good mattier to he ſame place. And therfore / as Auicen ſaith / ofte rubbyng with oynions is very holſome for balde men.Auicen .ii. can. ca. de preal. Et vii.iii. ca. de curatiōe alo perie. Wherfore the texte concludethe / that this rubbynge with oynions prepareth ye beautie of the heed: for heares are ye beautie of the heed. For a farther knowlege of oynious operation / witteth / that they ſtere to carnall luſt / ꝓuoke the appetite / brynge colour in the face / myngled with hony they diſtroy wartes / they engendre thyrſte / they hurte the vnderſtādynge (for they engēdre an yll groſſe humour) they encreace ſpittell / & the ieuſe of them is good for wattrynge eies / and dothe clarifie the ſyghte / as Auicen ſayth. Farther note / that oynions / hony / and vineger ſtamped to gether / is good for bytynge of a madde dogge. And therfore ſome adde theſe .ij. verſes vnto the forſayde texte.

by reaſon that theyr naturall heate / whiche is begynner of all ſtrength and operation / is but feble.

Fourthly / flematike folkes are more inclined to ydelnes and ſtudy than folkes of other cōplexion: by reaſon of theyr coldnes / that makethe them ſlepe. Fyftlye / they ſlepe lōger / by reaſon of theyr great coldnes / that prouoketh them to ſlepe. Syxtelye / they be dull of wytte and vnderſtandynge: for as temperate heate is cauſe of good witte and quicke vnder ſtādyng: ſo cold is cauſe of blūt witte & dul vnderſtādyng. Seuēthly / they be ſlouthful / & that is by colde: for as heate maketh a mā lyght & quicke in mouyng: ſo cold maketh a man heuy & ſlouthful.

            Here are touched .vij. thynges / whiche cauſe a hummynge & a noyſe in ones eare. The fyrſt is / feare / and after ſome / motion. The cauſe is / for in feare / the ſpiritis and humours crepe inwarde towarde the harte ſodaynlye: by whiche motion ventoſite is lyghtly engendred / whiche entrynge to the organ of the hearynge cauſeth tyngynge or ryngynge in the eare. By corporall mouynge alſo humours and ſpiritis are moued / of whiche motion ventoſite is lyghtly engendred / whiche commynge to the eares cauſethe ryngynge. For ryngynge is cauſed through ſome mouynge of a vapour or ventoſite about the organ of the heryng / mouynge the naturall aire of thoſe pipes cōtrary to theyr courſe. The .ij. is great hunger:Auicē .iiii.iii. cap. ix. Auicen ſheweth the reaſon ſayenge: that this thyng chā
               cethe throughe humours ſpredde and reſtynge in mans body. For whan nature fyndeth no meate / ſhe is conuerted vnto them / and reſoluethe & moueth them. The .iij. is vometynge: For in vometynge / whiche is a laborious motion / humours are ſpecially moued to the heed. In token wherof we ſe the eies and face come redde / and the ſyghte hurte. And thus alſo by vometyng / vapours and ventoſites are ſoone moued to thorgan of the herynge. The .iiij. is ofte beatynge about the heed / ſpecially the eare. For therby chanceth vehement motion of the naturall aire / beynge in the organ of the herynge. For whan any membre is hurte / nature

is hurt. The .iiij. is the wynde / and ſpecially the ſouthe.Hippoc. apho. illo.

After fleme in goodnes is coler: whiche is partner with natural hete

ſo longe / as it kepeth conuenient meaſure. Than foloweth melancoly / as dregges and durte remoued aparte from the principles of lyfe / ennemy to ioye and liberalite / and of nere kynred to age and dethe. Secondly note / that in the diuiſion of humours / there is .ij. kyndes of blud / that is to ſay / naturall & vnnaturall. Naturall blud is ruddye: that is to ſaye / veyne bludde ruddye and obſcure: and arterie bludde ruddye and clere: without yll ſauour: and in compariſon of other humours / is very ſwete. Unnaturall is double: the one is vnnaturall in qualite / that is to ſay / whiche is chā
               ged from good cōplexion in it ſelfe: orels by mynglȳge of an other humour. There is an other vnnaturall bludde / whiche throughe mynglynge of other humours / is yll bothe in qualite / ſubſtance / quantite / and in proportion of the one to ye other. And this is double: for the one is nat naturall / by mynglyng of an yll humour / that cometh to hym from without. The other is vnnaturall by mynglynge of an yll humour / engendred in the ſelfe blud: as whan parte of the blud is putrified / and the ſubtile parte therof is tourned in to coler / and the groſſe part in to melancoly: orels that coler / or that melācoly / orels both remayneth in the blud. And this vnnaturall bloud / by mynglynge of an yll humour / varieth from naturall bludde many wayes. Fyrſt / in ſubſtance: for hit is groſſer and fouler: ſith melācoly is myngled therwith: orels hit is more ſubtile / whan wattriſhenes or citrine coler is myngled therwith. Secondlye in colour:

for ſome tyme / whan fleme is myngled therwith / hit enclineth to whitenes / or through melancolye to blackenes. Thirdly in ſauour: for by mynglȳg of putrified humours hit is more ſtynkynge: orels by mynglynge of rawe humours hit hath no ſauour. Fourthly in talage: for by mynglyng of coler / hit enclineth to bitternes / and by melancoly to ſowernes / or by fleme to vnſauerynes. Alſo of fleme there be .ij. kyndes / naturall & vnnaturall. Naturall is that / whiche within a certeyne ſpace wyll be bloudde: for fleme is vndigeſted bloudde. There is an other ſpice of fleme / whiche is ſwete and ſome what warme / if hit be compared to the bodily hete: But comparynge hit to ruddye blud and coler / hit is colde. Fleme is naturally whyte: and this is called ſwete fleme / extendynge this name ſwete to all the talages delitynge the taſte: for other wiſe this natural fleme is nat ſwete: but vnſauery and watriſhe / and very nere the talage of water. And to this fleme / nature hath nat gyuen a ꝓpre manſion / as ſhe hath done to coler and melancoly: but nature maketh it ronne with the bloud: for it hath a very nere ſimilitude to bloud. And of this fleme there be .ij. neceſſites and one vtilite. The fyrſte neceſſite is / that hit be nere the membres / ſo that theyr vertue maye digeſte and turne hit in to bloudde: and that the membres by hit may be nouriſhed / whan they haue loſte theyr naturall foode / that is for to ſaye / good bloudde / throughe reſtrynte of material bloud / whiche reſtreynt is cauſed of the ſtomake & lyuer / through

ſome cauſes accidentall. The .ij. neceſſite is / that hit myngle with the bloud / and make hit apte to nouriſhe the mēbres of flematike complexion / as the brayne and nuche: for that that muſt noryſhe theſe mēbres / muſt be well myngled with fleme. The vtilite of fleme is that hit moyſt the ioyntes and membres / that moue moche / leſte they waxe drie through the heate that cometh of theyr mouynge and rubbynge. Vnnaturall fleme may be deuided. Fyrſte in hit ſubſtance: & ſo ſome therof is muſcillaginoſū: and that is fleme / to ones ſemynge / diuerſe: for in ſome parte it is ſubtile and thynne / and in ſome other groſſe and thycke: it is called muſcilaginoſū / bicauſe hit is lyke muſcilages / drawē out of ſedes. There is an other fleme that appereth egall in ſubſtance / that is in ſubtilite & groſſenes to ones demynge: but for a trouth hit is diuers in euery parte: this is named rawe fleme. And this encreaſethe in ye ſtomake and entrayles. And to auoyde hit out of the ſtomake / Hippocrates byddethe vs ſpue twyſe a monethe: and to voide hit out of the guttis / nature hath ordeyned coler to runne from the cheſt of the gall to the entrayle ieiuniū / & ſo forthe to the other lower guttis / to ſcoure away that fleme from the brymmes of the entrayles / and to cauſe hit to diſcende downe with the other dregges and fylthe. Some tyme this fleme is encreaſed in the veynes / ſpecially of olde folkes / by miniſhyng of theyr digeſtiō: and there remaynynge / is by lyttell & littell augmented and engroſſed / hurtynge nature / whiche

can nat by the veynes / therto ordeyned / voyde hit out / yet it doth that is poſſible to kepe it from the harte / and other inwarde membres: and driueth it to the outwarde membres / and ſpecially to the legges: for by hit heuynes hit naturally draweth to the lower partis of man: And this is the cauſe why olde folkes legges are ſwollen / & that if one preſſe downe his fynger therin / there taryethe a hole: ſpecially towarde night / and in fatte folkes / & ſuche as were wonte to be nouriſhed with moyſt meates. There is an other ſpice of fleme / verye ſubtile / & wattriſhe / lyke vnto water / ſome what thicke: This fleme is verye often myngled with theyr ſpittyll / that haue yll digeſtion / and of thoſe that be great drinkers: it runneth from ye brayne to the noſe / as hit is wonte in the begynnynge of the poſe: and whan by decoction and boylynge in man / hit cometh groſſe / hit is turned in to fleme / groſſe / white / and muſcillage. There is an other fleme groſſe and white / called gipſeum: the ſubtile partis of this fleme is diſſolued / through it longe bydynge in the iointis: and the groſſenes therof / remaineth in ye ioyntis as harde as ſtones. This fleme engēdrethe a goute vncurable. There is an other fleme thycke and groſſe / lyke to molt glaſſe / in colour / clāmynes and weight. Secondly vnnaturall fleme differethe in talage: for there is certayne fleme / yt is ſwete / whiche is by mynglynge of bludde with fleme. And vnder this is conteyned the vnctuous fleme: whiche is engendred by mynglynge of vnctuous bloud and fleme. There

is an other maner of vnſauerye fleme / cauſed of rawnes: as certeyne glaſſy fleme. There is an other ſalte fleme / cauſed by mynglynge of coler. And this is more bytynge / drier / and lyghter / thā any other fleme / through the coler / mingled therwith / whiche is drie lyght / and ſharpe. And this fleme is ofte founde in theyr ſtomakes / that be flematike / that drinke moche ſtronge wyne / and that vſe ſalte and ſharpe meates / and cleuynge to the ſtomakes / cauſeth other whyle thyrſt intollerable: and runnyng by the guttis / hit ſome tyme fleeth them: and cauſethe the bluddy menſyn: & in the fundemēt ofte tymes induceth ſtronge 
                  •
               o ſtiuenes. There is an other fleme that is ſharpe by mynglynge of ſharpe melancolye therwith: and ſome tyme / throughe boylynge of fleme: as hit chanceth in the ſwete ieuſes of frutes: that fyrſte boyle / and after waxe ripe: And this fleme appereth oftner in theyr ſtomakes that digeſt yll / than in other partis. For naturally coler floweth to the mouthe of the ſtomake / to ſtere vp thappetite: whiche deſcēdyng downewarde / ſome tyme myngled with fleme / maketh it ſower: and this is ꝑceyued by ſower belchynges. And other whyle this fleme is engendred in the ſtomake by boylȳg with a weake heate. There is an other fleme called pontike / whiche is ſome tyme cauſed by mynglyng of pōtike melancoly. But this is ſeldome / by reaſon that pontike melancolye is very ſcarſe. Hit is ſome tyme cauſed throughe vehement coldnes therof: wherby the moyſtnes therof is cōieyled

/ and ſome what altered to erthynes: and thervpon cometh no weake heate / whiche cauſynge it to boyle / ſhulde conuerte it in to ſharpenes: nor no ſtronge heate / whiche digeſtyng hit / ſhulde turne it in to blud. There be .ij. kyndes of coler / natural and vnnaturall. Vnnaturall coler is the fome of blud / whoſe coler is ruddy & clere / that is / citrine / in the laſte degree of citrines: as ſaffron heedes: and hit is lyghte and ſharpe: and the hotter the more redde it is. And after this coler is engēdred in the heed / hit deuideth in two partis / one parte gothe with the bloud in to the veynes / the other gothe in to the purſe of the galle. The parte that gothe with the bloud / entreth therwith bothe for neceſſite and profite. Hit is nedefull that hit myngle with the bloud / to nouriſhe ye colerike mēbres. Hit is behoueful / that hit make the bloud ſubtile / and cauſe hit to entre in to the veynes. The parte that gothe to the purſe of the galle / gothe eke thether for neceſſite and profite. The neceſſite is double. The one is nedefull for all the bodye / to mundifie hit from colerike ſuperfluites. The other neceſſite is in reſpecte of the galles purſe. The profite alſo is double. The one is to waſhe ye entrayles from dregges / and clāmy fleme / cleuynge to them. The other is to pricke ye guttis & muſculs / that they may fele the thynge that hurteth them / and voyde all other fylthynes. The profe of this is / that colike chanceth oftetymes by ſtoppynge of the hole that comethe from the purſe of ye galle to the guttis. Vnnatural coler is double. For one

is vnnaturall throughe outwarde cauſe myngled there with. The other is vnnaturall throughe a cauſe in it ſelfe: for the ſubſtance therof is nat naturall. Coler vnnaturall throughe an outwarde cauſe / is an other knowen and famous: And hit is that that fleme is myngled with. And it is called famous or notable: by reaſon hit is ofte engē
               dred. And of this kynde of coler cometh ye thyrde / wel knowen. There is an other yt is leſſe famous / and that is hit / wherwith melancoly is myngled Famous coler is either citrine / and engendred by mynglynge of ſubtile fleme with naturall coler / orels hit is yolkye / lyke to yolkes of egges / and is engēdred by mynglynge of groſſe fleme with natural coler. Coler of leſſe fame is cauſed .ij. ways. One is whan the coler is burned in hit ſelfe / and turned to aſhes / from whiche the ſubtile parte of the coler is nat ſeperated / but myngled therwith. And this coler is the worſte. An other is / whan melancoly cometh from without / and mynglethe hit with the coler. And this coler is better than other / and is ruddye in colour: hit is nat clere nor flowynge / but more lyke to veyne bludde. This vnnaturall coler / hauynge his owne propre ſubſtāce / without mynglynge of any other humour / is ofte engendred in the lyuer: by reaſon that the ſubtilnes of the bloud burneth hit ſelfe / and tourneth in to coler / and groſſely in to melancoly. An other coler there is / engendred in the ſtomake of yll meatis nat digeſted but corrupted: orels it is engendred in the veynes by other humours. And

of this coler be .ij. kyndes. For one is called coler praſſiue / lyke the colour of ye herbe called praſſion: whiche is engendred of the yolkynes whan hit is burned: for ye burnȳg cauſeth a yolky blackenes ī ye coler / whiche myngled with coler citrine / engē
               dreth a grene coler. The other is called ruſty coler / lyke to ruſty iron: & it is engendred of paſſiue: whā praſſiue is burned only tyl the humidite ther of be dried away: and through hit drines begynneth to waxe white. And theſe .ij. laſt colers be yll and venomous / and yet ruſty is the worſe. Lyke wyſe there be .ij. kyndes of melancolye / naturall and vnnaturall. The naturall is the dreggis and ſuꝑfluite of good bloud / whoſe talage is betwene ſwete and pontike. And this melancoly / whan hit is engendred in the lyuer / is parted in .ij. partis. Of whiche one entreth with the bloud / and there with remayneth in the veynes. The other is conueyed to the ſplene. The fyrſte parte entreth with the bloud for neceſſite and profite. Hit is nedefull that it myngle with the bloud / to noriſhe the melancoly / colde / and drie membres / as the bones. The vtilite is to make thycke the thynne bloud / to ſtynte the ſuꝑfluous runnynge therof / to make it ſtronge / and to ſtrengthe theſe membres in to whiche hit muſte be conuerted. The other parte / that nedeth no bloud / gothe to the ſplene both for neceſſite and profite. The neceſſite is double / one vniuerſall throughe out the bodye / to purge hit of melācolious ſuperfluite. The other is but ꝑticular / only to gouerne the ſplene. This melācoly is

alſo profitable for mans body / for hit runnethe to the mouthe of the ſtomake / ſtraynynge out the humidites / that hit fyndeth there / as a woman ſtraynynge a cowes dugges / drawethe out the mylke. This vtilite is double. Fyrſt hit conſtrayneth / thycketh / and comforteth the ſtomake. Secondly / by reaſon it moueth the mouthe of the ſtomake / through hit egernes / hit maketh one haue an appetite and luſt to meate. Vnnaturall melā
               coly is as a thynge burned or aſhes in reſpecte of other humours. Of this there are .iiij. famous kyndes / though there be many nat famous. The fyrſt is aſhes of coler: and this is bytter. The .ij. is aſhes of fleme: and if the fleme that is burned were very ſubtile and wattriſhe: than the melancoly therof engendred wyll be ſalte in talage. But if the fleme be groſſe yt is burned: than the aſhes therof / or the melancoly of hit engendred / enclyneth to ſowernes or ponti
                  •
               ite. The .iij. is aſhes of bloud / and this melancolye is laſte / a lyttell drawynge to ſwetenes. The .iiij. is aſhes of naturall melācoly. And if natural melancoly / wherof ſo it be / be ſubtile: thā it will be very ſower. And whā hit is caſte out vpon the grounde / hit boyleth and ſauoureth of the aire / and cauſeth both flies and beaſtis to voide the place. But if the naturall melancoly be groſſe / the vnnaturall therof ingēdred / ſhall nat be ſo ſower.

               Sanguine folkes.This texte techeth vs to knowe ſanguine folkes. Fyrſt / a ſanguine perſone is naturally fatte. But we may nat vnderſtande / that ſanguine folkes be proprely fatte: for that is a token of a colde complexion / Auicē .ii.i. doct. iii. cap. iii. as ſaythe Auicen: But they be fatte and fleſhye with all: for fatte in ſanguine perſones is taken for fleſhye. Auicen ſaythe: that abundance of ruddy fleſhe and ſtyffe / ſignifieth a hotte and a moyſt cōplexiō / as a ſanguine ꝑſon is. For thabū
               dance of ruddy fleſhe / wytneſſeth fortitude of vertue aſſimilatiue / and multitude of bloud / ye worke and waxe by heate and moyſture / as witneſſethe Galen / ſayenge: Thabundance of fleſhe is engē

                  egni. Wherto Galen aſſēteth. Secondly / the ſanguine perſon is mery and iocunde / that is to ſay / wt mery wordes he moueth other to laugh: orels he is gladde / throughe benignite of the ſanguine humour / ꝓuokynge a man to gladnes and iocūdite / through clere & perfect ſpirites engēdred of bloud. Thyrdly he gladly hereth fables & mery ſportis / for the ſame cauſe. Fourthlye he is enclyned to lecherie / through heate and moyſtnes / prouokynge

to carnall copulation. Fyftly / he gladlye drinketh good wyne. Sixtlye / he delyteth to fede on good meate: by reaſon the ſanguine ꝑſone deſyrethe the mooſte lyke to his complexion / that is good wynes and good meates. Seuenthlye / he laugheth lyghtly / for bloud ꝓuoketh to laughȳg. The .viij. is / the ſanguine perſone / hath a gladſome & an amiable countenance / through lyuelynes of colour / and fairenes of cōplexion. The .ix. is / he ſpeaketh ſwetelye / throughe amiablenes of ſanguine nature. The .x. is / he is apt to lerne any maner of ſcience / throughe lyuelynes and perſpicuite of his wytte. The .xj. is / he is nat lyghtlye angry: and this cometh through moyſtnes abatynge the feruour of coler prouokynge to anger. The laſte .ij. verſes recite ſome of the forſayde tokens / and alſo ſome other. Fyrſte / a ſanguine ꝑſone is free / nat couetous but liberall. Secondly he is amorous. Thyrdly / he hath a mery countenance. Fourthly / he is moſte parte ſmylynge: of whiche all the benignite of the bloud is cauſe and prouoker. Fyftlye / he hath a ruddye colour. For Auicen ſaythe / that ruddy colour of the ſkynne / ſignifieth abundance of bloud: And this muſt be vnderſtande of brighte ruddy colour & nat darke: ſuche as is wonte to be in theyr facis that drynke ſtronge wynes abundantlye / and that vſe ſauces and ſharpe ſpices: for ſuche colour ſignifieth lepre to come.

            Here the auctour teacheth vs to knowe a perſone of colerike complexion. Fyrſt / he is haſty / by reaſon of ſuperfluous heate / that mouethe hym to haſtynes.Auicē .ii.i. doct. iii. cap. iii. And therfore Auicen ſayth / that dedes of exceſſiue motion / ſignifie heate. Secondly / the colerike perſone is deſirous of honour / and coueteth to be vppermoſte / and to excelle all other: by reaſon that ſuꝑfluous heate maketh mās mynde prone to arrogāce and foole hardynes. Thyrdly / they lerne lyghtlye / by reaſon of the ſubtilnes of the colerike humour. And therfore Auicen ſaithe / that the vnderſtandynge / promptnes and quicke agilite to intelligence / betokenethe heate of complexion. Fourthlye they eate moche: for in them the heate digeſtiue is ſtronger / & more reſolutiue than in other bodies. Fyftly / they encreſſe ſoone / through ſtrength of naturall heate in them / whiche is cauſe of augmentation. The .vj. is / they be ſtoute ſtomaked / that is they can ſuffre no iniuries / by reaſon of the heate in them. And therfore Auicen ſayth ſecunda .i. doctrina .iii. cap. tertio: that to

& darke: lyke as clere ſpiritis make folkes gladde. The .iij. is / they talke lyttell / by reaſon of theyr coldnes. The .iiij. is / they be ſtudious / for they couet alway to be alone. The .v. is / they are no ſlepers / nor ſlepe nat well / by reaſon of the ouer moche drines of the brayne: and through melancoly fumes / they haue horrible dreames / yt wake them out of theyr ſlepe. The .vj. is / they be ſtedfaſte in theyr purpoſe / and of good memorie / and harde to pleaſe: and this comethe throughe theyr drines. The .vij. is / they thynke nothynge ſure / they alway drede / through darkenes of theyr ſpiritis. In the .ij. laſte verſes he recitethe ſome of ye forſayde ſignes and other. Fyrſte / the melancolye perſone is enuious. The .ij. he is ſadde. The .iij. he is couetous. Fourthly / he holdeth faſt / and is an yll payer. Fyftly he is ſimple / & yet diſceitfull: and therfore melancoly folkes are deuoute / great reders / faſters / and kepers of abſtinence. Syxtlye / he is fearfull. Seuenthly / he hath an erth ye browne colour: whiche colour if hit be any thinge grene / ſignifiethe the dominion of melancolye / as Raſis ſayth .ij. Alman.

A flematike perſone is whitely coloured: the colerike is browne and tawnye: the ſanguine is ruddy: the melancoly is pale / colered lyke erthe. Afterwarde the texte declareth .xij. colours / ſignifienge ſuperfluite of bloud. The fyrſt is whan the face is redde / by aſcendyng of bloud / to the heed and face. The ſecōd is / whan the eies bolle out farther than they were wonte. The .iij. is / whan the eies are ſwollen.

                  e iugenio that children ſhulde nat be let bloud / oneles they be .xiiij. yere olde at leſt: bicauſe childrē bodies be ſone reſolued from outwarde heate: and therfore by voydynge

of bloud they ſhulde be greatlye weaked. Alſo for that they nede to nouryſhe theyr bodies and augment them / they ſhulde nat diminiſhe theyr blud. And eke for that they be ſoone diſſolued from outwarde heate / hit ſuffiſeth / wherfore they nede nat to be let bloud. And wittethe well / that as bloud lettynge is nat conuenient for children / ſo it is vnholſome for olde folkes / as Galen ſaythe:Gal. lx. tegni. For the good bloud is littell and the yll moche: and bloud lettyng draweth away the good bloud / & leaueth the yll / as Auicen ſaythe: and therfore bloud lettynge is vncōuenient for ſuche perſones.Aui. iiii.i. cap. x. Secōdlye / he puttethe the hurte of bloud lettynge. Of neceſſite with voidynge of bloud / done by bloudde lettynge / mans ſpiritis beynge in the bloud / do grealye auoyde. Thyrdlye / he ſheweth howe the ſpiritis ſhulde be cheriſhed and reſtored: and that is by drinkynge of wyne after the bloud lettyng: For of all thynge to noriſhe quickely / wyne is beſt as is before ſayde. The ſpiritis alſo be cheryſhed and reſtored by meatis / but that is nat ſo quickely as by wyne. And the meate after bloud lettynge / muſt be lyght of digeſtion / and a great engendrer of bloud / as rere egges / and ſuche lyke. And all thoughe meate reſtore the ſpiritis after bloud lettynge / yet let ye pacientes beware of moche meate the fyrſte and .ij. day. For Iſaac ſaythe in dietis: that they muſte drynke more than eate: and yet they muſt drynke leſſe than they dyd before bloud lettynge: for digeſtion is weaker. Fourthlye / the auctour putteth .xj. conueniences of bloud lettȳge

duly done. Fyrſte / temperate bloud lettynge comforteth the ſyghte: for diminiſhynge of humours doth eke diminiſhe fumynge to the heed / and the repletion therof / darkynge the ſyght. Secondelye / hit clerethe and maketh pure the mynde and brayne / through the ſame cauſe. Thyrdly / it heateth the mary: for it miniſhethe the ſuperfluites / that therto come and cole it. Fourthly / it purgeth the entrayles: for nature vncharged of bloud / digeſteth better rawe humours that be lefte. Fyftly / bloud lettynge reſtreyneth vometyng and the laſke: for hit diuerteth the humours from the interior partis to the outwarde: & ſpecially lettȳge bloud of the armes / as Auicen ſaith: For lettyng bloud of the feet ſtoppeth nat ſo well: yet ꝑchance the bloud lettynge ſhall augmente the laſke / and that .ij. wayes. Fyrſte / by bloud lettynge nature is diſcharged of her burden: and thā comforted / hit prouoketh other vacuations. Secondly / if the laſke be cauſed by great weakenes of vertue contentiue: For than / for that by bloud lettynge vertue is weaked / the laſke is augmented. The .vj. is that blud lettyng clereth the wyttis: For it miniſheth vaporation that gothe to the heed & troublethe the wyttis. The .vij. is hit helpethe one to ſlepe / for therby many humours be voyded / by whiche ſharpe vapours and diuers are lyfted vp / lettynge one to ſlepe. The .viij. is / hit takethe awaye tediouſnes and ouer great grefe: for therby vertue is vnlodē of grefe: and eke with the bloud melācoly / the dregges of bloud / whiche induceth

tediouſnes and grefe / is drawen out. The .ix. is / hit cōforteth the herynge: for therby the vapours and humours aſcendinge to the heed / and lettȳge the herynge / are diminiſhed. The .x. is / hit comforteth the voyce: for therby the ſuperfluites and humidites / that may come to the breaſte or pype of the lyghtis / and let the voyce / are diminiſhed. The .xj. is / hit augmentethe the ſtrengthes: for therby the body is vnladen of hit grefe / wherfore vertue is augmented.

            Here thauctour ſayth / that theſe .iij. Maye / ſeptember / & aprile / are the monethes of the moone: and in them are dayes forbidden to let bloud / that is the fyrſte of Maye / and laſte of ſeptember and aprile. Thoughe this be a cōmon rule / yet hit is falſe. For the forſayde dayes maye be as good and worthy to be choſē as the other / after the diuerſite of conſtellation in them. Farther / the auctour ſaith / yt in thoſe days none ſhuld eate gooſe fleſhe: whiche alſo is falſe & erronious / and very witchecraft. I thynke thauctour had this ſayeng of the iewes / whiche obſerue ſuche maner. Secōdly he ſaith / yt men of myddell age & yonge folkes / whoſe

veynes be ful of bloud / may be let bloud euery moneth: for thoſe may well reſiſt reſolutiō: & in them is great quātite of good bloud. Thyrdly he ſaith: that blud lettyng for mans helth / muſt be done in one of theſe .iij. monthes / maie / ſeptēber / & aprile. but yet with difference. for in aprile & maie the lyuer veyne muſte be let bloud / bicauſe than in vere tyme the bloud encreaſeth: and in ſeptēber in the ſplene veyne / bicauſe of melancoly / whiche than in autumpne encreaſeth.

            Here thauctor putteth .xij. thynges that let blud lettyng. The fyrſt is coldnes of complexion. for as Galen ſaith: bloud lettyng cooleth & augmenteth coldnes: bicauſe / as Iſaac ſayth / bloud is the foū
               dacion of natural hete: and in that bloud lettyng voydeth bloud / hit voydeth hete / & ſo conſequētly cooleth. The .ij. is a feruent colde contrey / vnder whiche a cold ſeaſon ſhulde be cōprehēded / whiche alſo letteth bloud lettyng: for in a coūtrey & ſeaſon very cold / the blud is cloſed in the depeſt partis of the body: and the bloud that taryeth in the vtter partis / the colde maketh thycke / whiche to voyde is no wiſedome. The .iij. is feruēt ache: vnder whiche eke may be cōprehended great inflāmation of the body: for if one in ſuche accidētis be let bloud / there foloweth motion agitatiue / contrarie to nature

/ and greatter inflāmation / whiche weaketh nature more. The cauſe of this motion agitatiue is attractiō to diuers partis: for by bloud lettyng attraction is cauſed to the place yt is let blud: & by great ache / attractiō is cauſed to the place of ache. The cauſe of greatter inflāmaciō is / yt by blud lettyng ye humors be moued / wherby they be more inflamed. And this is trouthe whan blud lettyng is lyttell & artificial. Yet if it be done tyl one ſwoūd hit is holſome in the forſaide caſes: for this bloud lettyng / whan it ouercometh the attraction of the ache: it cauſeth nat motion agitatiue. & like wiſe it taketh awaye inflāmation / whan there be no humors / that ſhuld moue hete / and cauſe more inflā
               macion. This is Galens mynde / ſayeng:Gal. in cō
                  men. illius apho. que egerunt. there is no better medicine for an īpoſtume of feruēt inflā
               mation / feuers / & a great ache / than blud lettyng. The .iiij. is baynyng / ſpecially reſolutiue: for that letteth bloud lettyng: for that were vacuatiō vpō vacuatiō / whiche nature can nat eſily beare. The v. is carnall copulacion: for īmediately ther after one ſhuld nat be lettē bloud / bicauſe of double weakyng of nature. The .vi. is to olde or to yonge / as it is before touched. Of this Auicen ſayth: Take hede howe thou letteſt one bloud in any of the forſaid caſes: outcept thou truſt in the figure / in ſolidite of the muſculs / largenes of the veynes / ye fulnes of them / and ruddy colour. The .vii. is longe ſicknes: for by ſuche lettȳg of blud / nature is doubly febled / both by the lōge ſickenes & diminiſhiō. This is of trouthe ſayth Auicen / outcept there be

corrupt bloud / for than bloud lettyng is holſome. The .viij. is great replecion of drynke. The .ix. is to eate to moche meate: and vnder this is cōpriſed meate vndigeſted. The cauſe hereof (as Auicen ſayth) is this: there be .iij. thynges that drawe to them / that is voydnes / hete / and ſecrete vertue or proprete. Than if the veynes be empty through voydyng of bloud / they drawe to them frō the ſtomake or lyuer / vndigeſted or ſuꝑfluous meate or drynke: whiche vndigeſted meate cōmen to ye mē
               bres / can nat be amended / that is / digeſted: for ye third digeſtion can nat amende the faute of the .ij. nor the ſecōde of the fyrſt: if the faute be ſo great yt hit can nat conuert into the mēbres: hit there remaynȳg may cauſe ſome diſeaſe. The .x. is feblenes.Gal ii.

                  . for bloud lettyng is a ſtronge voyder / as Galen ſayth: therfore a feble perſone may nat endure great diminiſhyng of blud. The .xi. is ſubtile ſenſiblenes of the ſtomakes mouthe: whiche is called the hart ſtrynge: for of ſuche bloud lettyng ſwoū
               
               
                  •
               yng foloweth eaſily. And vnder this / weakenes of the ſtomake is eke cōpriſed / and eaſy flowynge of coler to ye mouthe therof / enduſyng vometyng. Wherfore they yt haue the forſaid accidentes ſhuld nat be let bloud: for by bloud lettyng the humors moued be enduced to the ſtomakes mouthe / as to a place accuſtomed: and bicauſe hit is a weake & an impotent membre to reſiſte that flixe: therfore by ſuche lettynge of bloud many inconueniences chāce. This is one cauſe why many ſwoūd / whā they be let bloud: by reaſon the coler floweth to ye
               
ſtomake: whiche bytynge the ſtomake / pyneth ye hart & ſtomake ſo / that hit cauſeth one to ſwoūde. The .xij. is lothyng: for if in this lothynge one be let bloud / whan the veynes be empty / they drawe to them yll mattier cauſyng lotheſomnes. Auicen toucheth many of theſe .vi. laſt accidentis. And beſides the forſaid accidentis there be other that let bloud lettyng. Firſt voydyng of menſtruous flixe or the emeraudes: for one diſeaſed with eyther of theſe ſhulde nat be let bloud: yet it may be done to diuert the flixe or matter. The .ii. is rarenes of cō
               poſition: for in rare bodies is moche diſſolucion: & therfore this reſolution ſuffiſeth them without euacuation / as Galen ſayth .ix. teigni. The .iii. is rawnes and clāmynes of humours: for than beware of bloud lettyng / bicauſe it encreaſeth rawenes of humours: and therfore in lōge ſickenes ye ſhuld nat let bloud: for rawnes of humours encreſeth / ſtrength febleth / and the ſickenes prolōgeth. And therfore Auicen ſayth / that in longe ſickenes before one is let bloub / he ſhuld take a laxatiue / although he nede bothe. Rawnes of humors is cauſed .ii. wayes. One is throughe abundance of humours chokyng naturall hete: whiche chokynge bredeth rawe humours / and than bloud lettynge is holſome. Wherfore Alexander ſayth: Lettyng of bloud in ye begynnyng of the dropſy is holſome:Alex. ii.ii. ca. de hydroppiſt. whan it cometh by abūdance of mēſtruous blud / that through ſome cauſe is prohibited to iſſue: or by abūdance of the emeraudis: For lyke as a lyttel fire is quēched vnder a great heape of wodde:

lyke wiſe natural hete is ſuffocate with abundāce of humours. The .ij. cauſe of rawe humors / is feblenes of natural hete / as in folkes of feble cōplexion / or that haue ben longe ſycke / or be very aged: for than ye ſaid blud lettyng is vnholſome: bicauſe hit augmenteth rawenes: for the blud that obſerueth hete / is drawen out / and ſo the body is made colde and the humours more rawe: Therfore the bloud muſt be left to digeſt theſe rawe humours. The .iiij. is vndue diſpoſicion of the aire / eyther to hotte or to colde: for moche hete cauſethe ſtronge reſolucion: and great colde maketh ye blud thicke and vnapte to iſſue or auoyde.

               v. thynges in bloud lettyng.This text declareth .v. thynges that ought to be done about bloud lettyng: ſome before / ſom at the tyme / & ſome after. The firſt is anoyntyng / whiche other while is vſed in the bloud lettyng / as to anoynte the place or veyne yt is opened: to aſwage the peyne: ſomtyme hit is vſed after blud lettyng to kepe the gaſhe that it cloſe nat vp to ſoone / that the humours left in the veynes may haue ſom reſpiracion / and ſome yll fumes voyde out. The .ij. is to drȳke / and ſpecially wyne / whiche is good in blud lettyng / if one hap to ſwoūde: and alſo hit is very holſome after blud lettyng / to reuiue the ſpirites & engendre newe blud / whiche thyng in practyſe all phiſitians obſerue. The .iij. is baynyng / 

whiche is holſome .iij. dayes before and .iij. dayes after blud lettyng / & nat the ſame day. Hit is good before / if one thynke he haue groſſe humors within hym: for baynyng leuſeth & moueth humors: & for the ſaid cauſe / hit is holſome to take a ſharpe ſyrope before / to moue / diſſolue / and make ſubtile the humours. And therfore / whan ye wyll let one blud / ye muſt rubbe the arme / that the humours in the veynes about may be made ſubtile & prepared to iſſue out more eſily. Hit is holſom after blud lettynge / that the reſidue of humours & vapours left behynd / may be leuſed. Hit is nat holſome the ſame day / for baynyng maketh ye ſkyn lynnowe / whiche made lynnowe / wyl nat abyde ye ſtroke gyuen in blud lettyng / & that is dāgerous. The .iiij. is byndynge with lynnen clothes / whiche is very holſome to ſtop the blud after euacuation therof: & before bledyng / to drawe the humours to the veynes / and to cauſe them to ſwel / & better to appere. The .v. is moderate walkyng before blud lettyng to diſſolue & make ſubtile the humors: afterward to leuſe the reſidue of the humours lefte behynde. Here note / that ſome vſe to be let blud faſtyng: but ſome other ſay / hit were better to eate a rereroſted egge fyrſt / and therto drynke a draught of wyne / about the houre of .ix. or .x. before dyner / and forth with to be let blud. The cauſe is / whā ye ſtomake is empty / nature reteyneth ſtyl ye blud more ſtrōgly / leſt ſhe ſhuld lacke noriſhement: but whan one hath eate a lyttel noriſhyng meate / as wyne & egges is / than nature ſuffreth ye blud better to iſſue.

               Here be declared .iii. effectis of blud lettyng. Firſt it maketh a ſad ꝑſone mery. Secondly it appeſeth angry folkes. The reaſon is this: moche melācoly myngled with the blud / cauſeth heuynes / and moche coler cauſeth āger: whiche .ij. humors / as they be myngled with the blud / are drawē out by blud lettyng. Thirdly hit kepeth louers from furious rauyng / for it remoueth the blud frō ye heed auoydyng it by the other exterior partis. Farther note / that there be .v. cauſes of blud lettyng. The firſt is / that the abundance / whether it be in qualite / or quantite / or bothe / ſhuld be voyded. For as Auicen ſayth / two maner folkes muſt be let blud. One is they that be diſpoſed to be ſicke / that haue abundāce of blud in quantite. The other is they yt are ſicke alredy / through the malice of humors or blud. But there is difference in theſe .ii. blud lettynges. For blud lettyng for the abūdance of blud ought to be moche: but whā it is done to auoyde yll blud / it muſt be moderate / as Galen ſaythe .ix. metategni. And therfore they do very yll yt let them ſelfe blede tyll they ꝑceyue the good blud iſſue / for ꝑauenture all theyr blud ſhall rūne out / er they ſe any good blud appere. Therfore they ſhuld voyde a lyttel at ones: and after the mynde of Galen / in this caſe: before they let one blud / they ſhuld gyue hym good meates / to engēder good blud / to fulfyl the place of the yl blud auoyded: and after within a lyttell ſpace / to let hym blud a lyttel and a lyttel.

This is called directe lettȳg of blud: for it is done to auoyde abundāce of blud / and of ſuche humors as ſhulde be auoyded. The fyrſt indirecte cauſe is the greatnes of ye diſeaſe / and greatnes of the apparent vehement inflāmacion: for as Galē ſaith / ther is no better medicine for an īpoſtume of vehement inflāmacion / feuers / & great ache / Gal. in cō

                  egerunt. thā blud lettyng. The .ii. indirect cauſe is / that the mattier whiche muſt be auoyded / be drawen to y• place frō whens it muſt be auoyded. And therfore in retencion of ye menſtruous flixe & emeraudis / the great veyne in the 
                  •
               ote called ſophena / muſt be opend / as Galen ſaith / to draw downe the mattier of ye blud. The .iij. indirect cauſe is / to drawe ye humours to the place contrary to that place that they flow to / to diuert the mattier frō yt place. Therfore / for to moche abūdance of mēſtruoſite / the veyne baſilica muſt be let blud / to turne the mattier to ye cōtrary part / and ſo to voyde hit frō hit propre courſe. And therfore he yt hath a plureſie on his lyft ſyde / muſt be let blud on the right ſide / to diuert & drawe the mattier to the place cōtrarie to yt place that it inclineth to. And like wiſe if it be on ye right ſide / to let blud on the lyft. The .iiij. indirect cauſe is / that bi lettyng of blud one portion of the mattier may be auoyded / that nature may be the ſtronger vpon ye reſidue: and ſo lettyng of blud is holſome / whan ye body is ful / leſt impoſtumes growe: for ye regimēt of nature is feble / ī regard of theſe humors: wherfore a portion of ye mattier is voyded / leſt through vnablenes of nature in gouernyng the mattier / ye
               
mattier ſhuld flowe to ſom weake place and brede an impoſtume.

               eſt ye fumes engēdred by ſlepe aſcēde to the heed & hurt ye brayne. There be other cauſes. Fyrſt / leſt he in ſlepe turne hym on the arme that is let blud and therby hurt hym. The .ii. is / leſt ye humours by ſlepe flowe to ye peynful mēbre / by reaſon of the

inciſion / & ſo brede an impoſtume. For Galē ſaith / that if impoſtumes brede in ye body / or in a mēbre hurt: the humours flowe thervnto. But Auicen aſſigneth an other cauſe / that by ſuche ſlepe may chance cōfraction of the mēbres: The cauſe may be as Galen ſayth / that ſlepe is vnholſome in the ague fyt: for natural hete goth inward / Gal. ii. apho. ſuꝑ illo. In quo &c. and ye out ward ꝑtis waxe colde / & ye fumes remayne vnconſumed: wherby the rigour is augmented / and ye feuer fyt ꝓlonged. Alſo by mouyng of ye humours ī lettȳg of blud / fumes are reiſed vp to ye ſenowes and braunes of ye armes: whiche remaynyng vnconſumed / waxe colde in ſlepe / and ingroſſe in the vtter partes. And therfore if one ſlepe īmediately after lettyng of blud / they cauſe confraction of the ſenowes and braunes of tharmes. Secondly / he ſayth / that one in lettyng blud muſt beware / yt he make nat ye gaſhe to depe / leſt he hurt a ſenowe or an arterie ſtrynge vnder ye veyne: for hurtyng of a ſenowe cauſeth a mortal crampe / or loſſe of a mē
               bre / as an arme or a fynger: and hurt of an arteri ſtrynge / cauſeth bledyng vncurable. The .iiij. is / one ought nat to eate īmediatly aft he is let blud / but he muſt tary tyll ye humors in hym be in qete / leſt ye meate er hit be digeſted be drawen together with the blud / to ſuccour the hurt membre.

               rryng. The .iii. rule is / yt lettyng of blud ſhuld nat be done in begȳnyng of the ſickenes / whan criſis is remoued: for Iſaac ſaith in his boke of vrins / that though the hart be the engēdrer of the blud & ſpiritis / yet the blud is fundaciō of natural hete / & ſuſteyneth hit: for hete is naturally therof engendred: and therfore one voydyng blud voydeth hete: whiche ſhulde digeſt the mattier of the ſickenes: and ſo cōſequently the ſickenes is prolōged / & ſtrengthe weaked. And therfore hit is to drede / leſt through lengthynge of the

ſickenes / and weakyng of ye ſtrēgthe / nature ſhuld fayle. The .iiii. rule is / that ye body hauyng dregges or filth ī the guttis / ſhuld nat be let blud. The cauſe is: there be .iii. thȳges yt draw to them / hete emptynes / & all the ſhap: nowe the veynes ēpted by lettyng of blud / dawe to them frō the next mē
               bres / as the guttis & ſtomake / wherby yt bealy is indurated / & the mattier in the veynes more infected: the miſeraike draweth the humidites of the ordeurs / & the ordeurs are dried the more: therfor ye muſt fyrſt mollifie the bealy with cliſters or ſuppoſitories / except it waxe laxatiue alone. The .v. rule is / That lettyng of blud ſhulde nat be moche vſed: for by oft vſyng therof / one waxyng olde / falleth in to dyuers diſeaſes / as epilencie / apoplexie / and palſey: for by remouyng of ye blud & hete / many flematike ſuꝑfluites are engendred / that cauſe theſe diſeaſes. The .vi. rule is / that a woman mē

The .vii. rule is / that after the colerike paſſion one ſhuld nat be let blud: for bi reaſon that lettyng of blud ſturreth vp the humors / a colerike

The reaſon of all theſe cōmodites is / bicauſe the forſayd veyne auoydeth blud frō al theſe places / as after it ſhall appere. For a more ample declaracion hit is to witte / that in lettyng of blud / other while the veynes be opend / and ſomtyme ye arteries. The openȳg of the arterie is dāgerous: the chiefe cauſe hereof is the ouermoche bledyng:

whiche is cauſed .ii. ways. One is through feruēt hete of the arterie blud. for a hotte thyng is ſoone mouable / & delateth & openeth ye arterie: and therfore hit helpeth moche / to voyde ye blud in lettyng blud the arterie. The .ii. cauſe is mobilite of ye arterie: and therfore the woūde or gaſhe in it is ſlowlier healed: for woūdes without reſt can nat heale. Yet this lettȳg of blud is holſome .iii. maner wiſe. Fyrſt / whan there is abūdāce of ſubtile blud ī the body. Secōdly whan ye blud is vaporous. Thirdly whan it is hotte. For ſubtile blud / of whiche natural blud & ſpiritis be engēdred / reſteth in the arterie: but groſſe blud that noriſheth the mēbres / reſteth in the veynes. Lyke wyſe vaporous blud is cōteyned in the arterie / & ſanguine blud in the veynes.

Frō the arme pyt to the elbowe are .v. veynes to be opend / as Raſis & Auicen ſay: One is called cephalica / whiche is the heed veyne: the .ii. is called baſilica / whiche is the liuer veyne. The .iii. is mediana or cardiana or nigra after Auicen / or matrix after Raſis. The .iiii. is aſſellaris. The .v. is funis brachii. In the leſſe hāde is ſaluatella: ſo that in the arme / in that it cōteyneth

the more and leſſe hāde / are .vi. veynes to be opēd. Cephalica empteth the partis aboue the necke: and therfore to open hit is good for diſeaſis of ye heed / ye megrym & other hotte grefes / or cauſed of hotte mattier. This veyne begynneth at the ſhulder / & goth forth toward the lyft ſyde of the arme. Baſilica empteth the partes vnder the necke / as frō ye breaſte & lyuer: and therfore lettyng blud of this veyne is holſome for diſeaſes of the breaſt & lyuer / and right good in a plureſy. This veyne begynneth at the arme hole / and goth alōge to the bowyng of the arme. Mediana is betwene theſe .ii. ſaid veines / & is cōpact of them both: for it is ye brāche of eche. And it is eke median in vacuation: for it voydeth frō al about / vnder / frō / & aboue ye necke. Wherfore it is the vniuerſall veyne to all the body in voydyng: nat vniuerſall (as ſome ſay) bicauſe it begynneth at ye

                  ica. And like wiſe if ye wold let baſilica blud / & it appereth nat / ye ſhulde rather miniſhe mediana than cephalica: for it agreeth better to bothe / than one of them with the other. Saluatella is the veyne betwene ye myddell and rynge fynger / more declynyng to ye myddell fynger. Hit begynneth of baſilica. This veyne is opend in the right hāde for opilacion of the lyuer / and in ye lyft hāde for opilaciō of the ſplene. There is no reaſon why it ſhuld be ſo as Auicen ſayth / but experiēce: whiche Galen foūde by a dreame as he ſayth: He

had one in cure / whoſe lyuer & ſplene were ſtopte / and he dreamed to let hym blud of this veyne / & ſo he dyd / and cured the pacient. This veyne is let blud / puttyng ye hāde in warme water / to engros and dilate it / bicauſe it is ſubtile: and yt the gaſhe ſhulde nat cloſe to ſoone / and to make ye groſſe blud thynne. Aſſellaris is vnder baſilica / and appereth ī byndyng the arme: and like iugemēt is of it as of baſilica. Funis brachii is ouer cephalica / orels the hyndermoſt bone: and is of one iugemēt with cephalica. Therfore as Auicē & Galen ſay / though in openyng of veynes / be vniuerſal vacuacion of all the body: yet nat frō al veynes egally: nor like ieoꝑdy is nat in all. For Raſis ſayth cephalica is ye ſurer / & baſilica more to be feared: and cardiaca is to feare / but nat ſo moche as baſilica. Cephalica is ſureſt: for there is neyther ſenow

               bett to open it / it wold be put in warme water. In ye fote be .iii. veynes / ſciatica / ſophena / & the hāme veyne. Theſe be opend whan we woll draw the blud to ye lower ꝑtis / as in prouokyng mēſtruoſite: and the hāme veyne is better than ſophena or ſciatica / for it is nerer the matrice. Sophena draweth blud frō ye yard / coddis / & matrice: and ſciatica frō the ancles raynes / and other mēbres toward mans lyft ſide. ſophena frō the matrice & mēbres there about / tho

they be branches of one veyne. In the myddis of the forheed is a veyne / whiche is opend for old diſeaſis of the face / as morpheu / drie ſcurfe & ſcabbe. & for diſeſis of the eies: but fyrſt cephalica muſt be miniſhed. There is like wiſe a veyne in the noſe / & in openyng of eche the necke muſt be boūde / & one opend after an other: & by byndyng the necke they wyl better appere.
