These discyples yet stoke no lesse in Crystis visyble flesshe, and in the barke of hys wordis, thē did the other iwes: & as do now More, belyuyng hym to haue had spoken of hys naturall body to be eatē wyth their tethe. whyche offence Chryst seyng, sayd: Do thys offende ye? what then wyll ye saye, if ye se the sone of man ascende thyther wher he was before?

               euer in any perplexite or doute: but sought all the wayes by similitudes and familiare examples to teche thes playnely. He neuer spake them so harde a parable, but where he perceyued their feble ignorance, a non he helpt them and declared it them. ye & some tymes, he preuented theire askinge with his owne declaration, and thinke ye not that he did not so here? yisse verelye. For he cam to teche vs, and not to leue vs in any doute and ignorance, especially in the chefe poynt of our saluacion, whiche standethe in the beleif in his dethe for our synnes. Wher for, to put them out of all dout as concerning this etinge of hys flesshe, and drinkinge of his blood, that shulde geue euerlastinge lyfe: where thei toke it for his very body to be eten with their tethe: he sayd, It is the spirit that geueth this lyfe, My flesshe profiteth nothing at all, to be eten as ye mean so carnally. It is spirituall meat that I here speke of. It is my spirit that draweth the hertis of men to me by faith and so refressheth them gostely, ye be therfore carnall to thinke that I, speke of my flesshe to be eten bodely, for so it profitethe you nothing at al. How longe wyl ye be without vnderstandinge? It is my spirit I tell you that geueth lyfe, My fleshe profiteth you nothinge to eat it: but to beleue that it shalbe crucifyed and suffer for the redempcion of the worlde it profyteth, And when ye thus beleue, then ete ye my flesshe & drinke my blood, that is ye beleue in me to suffer for your synnes. The verite hathe spokē these wordis My flesshe profiteth nothing at all: it cannot therfore

be false. For bothe the iwes and his disciples murmured and disputed of his flesshe how it shulde be eaten, and not of the offering therof for our synnes as cryste mēt. This therfore is the suer ancor to holde vs by agenst all the obieccions of the papists for the eting of Cristes bodye as they say in forme of breade. Cryste sayd My flesshe profyteth nothing: meaning to ete it bodely. This is the keye that solueth all their argumentis & openeth the waye to shew vs al their false and abominable blasphemous lyes vpon Cristis wordis, & vttereth their sleighe iuggelynge ouer the brede to mayntayn anticrystes kyngdom ther with. And thus when Criste had declared it and taught them that it was not the bodely eatinge of his material body: but the eating with the spirit of faithe: he added sayng. The wordis which I here speke vnto you ar spirit, and lyfe. that is to saye, this mater that I here haue spoken of with so many words must be spiritually vnderstāden to gyue ye this lyfe euerlasting. wherfore the cause why ye vnderstande me not is. that ye beleue not. Here is lo the conclusion of all this sermon. Cryste very God and man, had set his flesshe before them to be receyued with faithe that it shuld be broken and suffer for their synnes, but thei coulde not ete it spiritually because they beleue not in him. wherefore many of his disciples fill from him and walked nomore with him. And then he sayd to the twelue. wyll ye go a waye to? And Symon Peter answerde: Lorde, to whom shall we go? Thou haste the wordis of euerlastinge lyfe, and we beleue, and a

All these so playne wordis be sufficient, I trowe, to a crysten man to certifye his conscience that Cryste went his waye bodely ascending into heuen. For when he had tolde his disciples so ofte of his bodely departing from them: they were meruelouse heuy

and sadde. Unto whom Cryste sayd. Because I tolde ye that I go hence,Io. 14. &. 16. your herts ar ful of heuenes. If they had not beleued hym to haue spokē of hys very bodely absence: they wolde neuer haue so morned for hys goyng away And for because they so vnderstode hym, and he so ment as hys wordis sowned: He added (as he shulde haue sayde) be ye neuer so heuye or how heuely so euer ye take my goyng hence, yet do I tell ye trouthe. For it is expedyent for you that I go hence
                  •
                For if I shuld not go hence, that counforter shall not come vnto you. But and if I go hence, I shal sende hym vnto you. And agayn in the same Cap. I am comē frome the father, and am comen into the worlde, and shall leue the worlde agene and go to my father. what mystery, thynke ye, shuld be in these so manyfeste wordis? Dyd he speke them in any darke parables? Dyd he mean other wyse then he spake? Dyd he vnderstāde by goyng hence so ofte repered, to tary here styll? or dyd he mene by forsakyng and leuyng the worlde to be but inuisible beyng styll in the worlde wyth hys bodye? No suerly.

                  •
                and euen so dyd hys disciples wyth out any more meruelynge vnderstode him. For they answerd him sayng: Lo now spekest thou apertely: nether spekest thou any ꝓuerbe. But what a derke prouerbe and subtyle rydle had it bene: if he had ment by hys goynge hence to haue taryed here styll? and by forsakynge the worlde, to abyde

For as concernyng hys godhed, whiche was euer wyth the father, and in all placys at once, he neuer spake syche wordis of it. whan Cryste sayde, hys dethe now at hande, vnto hys disciples: now agene I forsake the worlde and go to my father, but ye shall tary styl in the world.
