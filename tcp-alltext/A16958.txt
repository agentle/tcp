            To the Chriſtian reader, grace & peace from Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
            THere came lately to my hands divers writings, controverting ſundry poynts of religion. The occaſion of writing them, was, the cōtradicting & ſpreading abroad as erroneous ſome doctrine taught by Mr Ainſvvorth one of the Ministers of the Engliſh church at Amsterdam: The exception ariſing, as it ſeemeth, from Mr Broughton or a book of his lately ſet out touching corruption in handling of religion. Now of theſe writings, there were ſome, both from the one & the other that wrote them cōmitted vnto me for the delivering of them, and (if I would) to take a copie. By reaſon wherof, as alſo conſidering that this controverſie concerneth divers points of Religion profitable to be obſerved; and both parties (I take it) being willing to have them ſeen and dulie weyghed of any: I have thought it good to publiſh in print al the writings that hetherto have paſſed from one to another, not doubting but it may much further the truth And bring glorie vnto God. And now I deſire both the Authors to take this my doing in good part, and thee (good Reader) indifferently to read & equally to iudge of the matters here controverted, as thou ſhalt ſee the truth by eyther of them to be proved vnto thee. Farewell.

               Mr Hugh Broughton, in a book of his to the King, lately ſet out, concerning corruption in handling of Religion, vvriteth thus: Of Aharons Ephod.
               OVr tranſlation giveth to the Ephod blew ſilk, purple, and ſcarlat, & white twined ſilk. The Iewes vniverſally hold that vvooll threed bleew and purple and ſcarlat, and vvhite linen, and golden plates cut as threed, made the cope: not the vncleane vvorme: and they vvill & may vvell hold vs Battes & Moulwates that cannot ſee that, for the tongue and ceremony, by their ſo plentifull and agreable vvritings. And of touching a vvorme, thus they vvrite: 
                     Ieruſalemy Thalmud, fol. 65. col. 1.v. antep.
                   
                  Yf a worme be in a mans hand, though he waſh himſelfe in the waters of Siloam, or in all the waters that God made, he ſhall not find abſolute cleannes. Now the worme, vncleane, by Ceremony, might not be in Ceremony figuring holineſſe. This errour our reverend Fathers vvill amend.
            
            
               
               Mr HENRY AINSVVORTH HIS vvriting concerning this queſtion: VVHither the High ſacrificers attire were made of ſilk or of wooll.
               THat they were not made of ſilk, this reaſon is alleged:
Becauſe the worm (wherof ſilk cometh) was vnclean by ceremonie, & therfore might not be in ceremonie figuring holines.
               
               And to prove they vver of wool, it is ſayd;
That the Iewes vniverſally hold, that wool threed blew & purple & ſcarlet, & white linen, & golden plates cut as threed, was the matter wherof thoſe garments wer made.
               
               BVt vnto the former it may be anſvvered;
               That though it wer granted to be worm-wrought ſilk, yet it need not be counted vnclean becauſe the worm was vncleā: for vnclean creatures whiles they wer aliue defiled not a man; but the eating of their fleſh, or touching of their carkeſſes being dead. Levit. 11.8.11.24, 31.41. Deut. 14.8. And the Iewes vſed the ſervice of vnclean beaſts continually, as of horſes, aſſes, camels &c, without pollutiō. Now ſeing Gods law limiteth their vncleānes in theſe two points; how may we extend it further?
               Againe, the Bee was by ceremonie vnclean, Deut. 14.19. yet the honie which ſhe gathered & wrought was not vnclean, eyther to touch or to eat.
               But if it be granted, that the ſilk as it is firſt taken from the worm, is vncleā; yet it foloweth nor, that after it is waſhed wound & woven by art of man, that it ſhould continew vnclean ſtil: ſeing that the hayr of vnclean beaſts when it was wrought into cloth had no vncleannes. The camel was vnclean, Deut. 14.7. yet Ioh. Baptiſt wore a garmēt of the hayr. Alſo the Eliphant, yet Solomō made a throne of the tooth, 1. king. 10.18. And it is holdē of the Iewes,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   that the bones, teeth, ſkins, hayr &c. of vnclean beaſts ar in ſuch vſe excepted, and pollute not a man. Why then ſhould the work of the ſilk-worme be alwayes vnclean?
               
                  If the ſilk which the worm maketh be vnclean, then the fleſh blood & humors of wormes & other like creatures, muſt needs be holden vncleā likewiſe, & ſo the vſe of them forbiddē about the ſanctuarie as wel as the ſilk. But the Iewes do ſome of them hold thoſe colours mentioned Exod. 25. to be died in the blood of wormes. as

                   (ſkolex) and Vermis a worm.
               But it may be further anſwered, that it mought be ſilk, though not ſuch as the worm worketh, for as al wool groweth not on the ſheeps back, but ſome is gathered from plants, as cotton wool: ſo is ther ſome kind of ſilk that groweth, as the Byſſe of 
                  
                     Ezek 27.7. 
                  Aegipt, finer then linen, and ſilk graſſe in Perſia & other countries. And if it wer ſuch that was vſed about the tabernacle, then was ther not that impuritie in the ſtuff which is affirmed.
               
                  Vnto the later point it may be ſayd,
                  That the Iewes which with ſo general conſent make wollē threed died into thoſe colours, & fine linē, & gold, the matter of thoſe ornamēts, ſeem herin to go againſt the playn law of God, which forbad that a man ſhould wear any garments of divers ſorts, as of linen & wollen togither, Deut. 22.11. and how is it like that God would then haue the High prieſts garments made of ſuch mixture. If it be anſwered, God might diſpenſe with that law: it may be replied; firſt let it be ſhewed that God would & did ſo diſpēſe, vvhich wilbe hard to ſhew from ſcripture, which mentioneth the die & colour onely, blew, purple & ſcarlet, and not the ſtuff. Secondly as he might diſpenſe for linſey woolſey, ſo might he do the like for ſilk, even of the worm; & then the tranſlation of ſilk is no more abſurd or erroneous then that of wollen. Thirdly if we conſider, the end of thoſe ornaments, which were 
                        Exod. 28.2. for glorie & bewtie, and the commandement afterwards expreſſed by Ezekiel, forbidding the prieſts to wear wool in their adminiſtration, (Ezek. 44.17.) it may ſeem probable, the garments were ſilken, or of ſuch like ſtuff, rather then woollen.
                  Moreover, touching the opinion of the Iewes, of pollution by a worme, it ſeemeth rather to ſavour of the Rabbines ſuperſtition, then of ſound religion, & to be without approbatiō of ſcripture, of other learned men, or of themſelves. For wheras this poſitiō of theirs is alleged out of the Thalmud. If a worm be in a mās hād, though he waſh himſelf in the waters of Siloā, or in al the waters that God made,

                     he ſhal not find abſolute cleannes: Firſt, Gods law maketh no other vncleannes, then by eating the fleſh, or touching the dead carkeſſe▪ as before is ſhewed. Againe of wormes, the Iewes them

Neyther was the reproch vpon me alone (which I could hav borne in ſilence,) but vpon al this poor church of Chriſt with me. Further when I met you at the printers, & had by occaſiō ſome litle ſpeech hereof, it was after reported I had yielded & revoked mine error. Herevpon I thought it needful (for ſtaying of falſe tumors) to giv out that writing. In it, I onely ſought after the truth, minding what might be both objected & anſwered. I found the ſtate of the queſtion to conſiſt of two branches, 1. That it might not be ſilk, becauſe that was vnclean by ceremonie. 2. That it was linen & wollen, becauſe the Iewiſh Rabbines ſay ſo. Of theſe points I wrote what I ſaw, not inveighing againſt any mans perſon, though I vvas not ignorant from what fountanie thoſe vvaters flowed. For this writing you reproch me, who rather ſhould hav inſtructed me with 2 Tim.

And to conclude becauſe it was ſilk that it was ſilk of wormes, hath no better ground then their aſſertion which ſay the fathers were in Hell, becauſe they wer in Hudes, ſeing ſilk is a general name as wel for that which naturally groweth, as for that which the wormes make.

               YF you were miſtaken for the Equivocation of ſilk, wit  would you ſhould haue opened your ſelf: ſeing our Copes imitating Aharōs ephod, have the ſilk of the worme.

                  Rambam is taxed in handling Aarons oinctment▪ I would adviſe you rather to read Ebrew treatiſes, then to hope for men of leaſure to ſhew your vvandringes. Specially being ſo vnthankfill as you are▪ and ſo far from hope of truth. Your Iudaiſme, that condemne all our Chriſtian churches as godles buildings, hath loſt al right of diſputing. So your befooling of ſaying the Lords prayer, according to the expreſſe commaundement: and making phraſes of wordes: to meane matter of ſuch effect: and your excōmunicating for Baptizing in the Dutch church: theſe deſperate Athean partes tell others, that you are not a church but a ſynagoge of Satan.
               The 1400. yeres experience you vvould have proved. O wiſe Chronicler. Yf you can proue any one yere to have divers thred in the Ephod: then M. Ainſwoorth ſhalbe the man, and vviſdome ſhall dye with him. Rabbines ſynce Ezra have recordes vniforme. Your threatning what you vvill not beleve, is a ridiculous confuting. I knovv you beleve litle aright.

                  the ſtone, argueth a ſtony vnderſtanding who vvould think of the marble here.
               For the Curtine ſtuff, Tremellius would not refuſe the Rabbines. He knew Moſes ſpake ſhort: as being preſent to open his mind: and the recordes in a lerned cōmon wealth ſhould ſtill continue. But he that cannot examin Tremellius
                  
when he miſſeth, or hitteth, ſhould be quick to hear and ſlow to ſpeak. Rancorous biting beſemeth none but the ſynagoge of Satan.
               In the end you will not contend. Why began you then? How idle are you?
               Seing I had not Munſter by me, how ſenſeles are you that think I might hitte rightly with eaſe, vpon the matter: or ſoone teach one as you are: or honour a wicked excommunicatour, and blaſphemer of the Chriſtians, and their Church? And your thankles hart that knoweth that the beſt glory of your ſtudies hath ben a theft frō my bookes: without mentioning the auctour, ſhould not ſeke my help.
               Yf you ſought truth you had long agoe folowed a better ſtudy. Your owne hart can tell you that in differing copies you cannot tell vvhat the Bible is. And for Tremel. whom Iunius checketh, thriſe, and himſelf, & would have yet once, but for prevention by death, you that vvil ſend others to him, ſhew your ſimplicity. The LXX allowed by the Apoſtles for much as for Ex. 28. are better. For Greek, tell why Beza 7. times or thereaboutes checketh himſelf, and then adventure to diſpute. Now your blyndnes bredeth ſaucy malepertſhip.
               
                  Peace you hate moſt deadly: that revile our holy buildinges: and befoole all Chriſtendome for 1500. yeres. and ſo for the Lordes prayer: and give your ſelf over to Satan: by vvicked excommunication.

               HOw wel yow have juſtified eyther the vnjuſt reproch of me, or your blame of our Engliſh tranſlations, touching the queſtion of Silk; & how ſoundly yow hav prooved linen & woollen to be the matter of Aarons garments, or worm-wrought ſilk to be vnclean & vnlawful; I leav it to the iudgement of the diſcreet reader that ſhal ſee your writings. As for my ſelf, I rely not vpon any mans aucthoritie, though I reverence & regard their help as is meet. The word of God (how ſhort ſoever it be written) giveth ſufficient light to the eyes, & vnderſtanding to the ſimple. By it I learne, that there grew
                     Exo. 9.3. 
                  flaxe in Aegipt, of wich linen properly is made; & that Sheſh was an other ſtuff, which the nobility of Aegipt 
                     Gen. 41.42. wore in honour; whervpō I gather, it excelled our linen.

                  Techeleth which with vs is blew ſilk, with you blew wollen, I find was the attire of then 
                     Eze. 23.6. Princes of Aſſyria & other nations; and with it & Purple, the hethens 
                     Ier. 10.9▪

                   golden ornamēts, which argueth theſe things to be neyther commune nor baſe, but rather as the ſcripture calleth them

                  royal attire. In the Lords Tabernacle I ſee the broydered curtaines to be made of this Sheſh, which was naturally white; and 3. other colours, which reaſon wil teach were ſuitable to the ſame. Now what likelyhood ther is that the 
                     Exod. 26▪ 6.4. golden taches ſhould be faſtned in loops of blew wollen threed; or the glorious breſtplate, ſhould be tied to the Ephod with 
                     Exod. 28.27.28. golden chaines & rings, & with blew wool; or that the 
                     ver. 36.37. pure goldē plate with the holy graving vpō it, ſhould be faſtned to the miter of Sheſh with blew wollen threed rather then with ſilk, (vnleſſe it be meant the wool of the xylon tree, or ſome ſuch like ſilken wool, and ſo the ſtrife be but about words,) I refer to be judged of them that read this controverſie.
               It is your ſelf that fayl in the Aequivocatiō, though yow wil not acknowledge it; for when the tranſlation giveth Silk, you conclude it to be of the worm: & now, to help your ſelf flee to the Copes, as if the Bible had been tranſlated out of the Popes ward-robe; and the interpretours had not looked to Moſes text, to expreſſe it in Engliſh, ſo neer as they could, by termes familiar to our Engliſh nation. Neyther yet ſhew you by the law of God, the ſilk of wormes to be vnclean, but refer to the reading of the Rabbines for proof of it & other your aſſertions.
               If it be graunted vvorms ſilk was lawful in civil vſe, why may it not with as good reaſon be held lawful in ceremonie, as linen & woollē, which in civil vſe was

                     Lev. 1. &c
                   vſed in ſacrifice, neyther is it reckned amōg the clean beaſts, (Deut. 14 4.5.) for civil vſe, nor wil eaſily be proved to be clean, if it vvere ſuch as our Badger, hovvſoeuer the Rabbines hold it to be a clean beaſt, and I vvil not deny it.
               And now that I hav ſeen your proofs, & vve ar come to this yſſue, I vvil freely confeſſe vvhat is the greateſt thing that hath moved ſcruple in me, cōcerning this matter of wool. The Apoſtle Hebr. 9.19. ſpeaking of ſprinckling of the blood of the covenant Exod. 24. mentioneth ſcarlet wool & hyſſoppe; which though they be not named in that place of Exodus, yet he might vvel gather from the like ſprinckling otherwhere, as in Lev. 14.4.6. vvher the hebrew being onely Scarlet, vve ar taught by the Apoſtle to vnderſtand in that place, Scarlet wool, from vvhence it may be conjectured that al the Scarlet about the Sanctuarie vvas wool alſo. But vvithal I have minded, that Scarlet is general, & may be applied to all ſtuff ſo coloured, vvhither vvool, as in this place; or other thing, as is like of that ſcarlet cord, Ioſh. 2.15.18.21. & that vvool being fitteſt to ſprinkle vvith, vvas here vſed.

Now Tremellius maketh al in the Sanctuarie Xylinum, & ſo, in this vnderſtanding the blew purple & ſcarlet might be vvool, & Ioſephus with other Ievves that cal it wool may be defended: & the rather ſeing the ſtuff vvas died before it was ſpoonn as appeareth Exod. 35.25. And this is al the probability for wool that I knovv in the Bible; vvhich yet is far from proving the points before handled; that ſuch a divers mixture was in the Prieſts garments, or that wormes ſilk was vnclean; & much leſſe vvil it condemne the tranſlation of ſilk in general.
               From the matter of Silk, you turne to other contumelie & reproch-charging this cōgregation of vvhich I am, to be no church but a ſynagogue of Satan: & that for 3. cauſes. 1 Our condemning al your Chriſtian churches as godles buildings

But if you wil needs vnderſtand & require a pronouncing of thoſe words in praying, ſeing the commaundement is general for al times & perſons; you muſt firſt caſt away your own popiſh leitourgies wher you teach men to ſay other words, & by which you check the Lord Ieſus & his ſpirit, taking vpon you to giv lawes & formes for prayer, other then his Teſtament alloweth. You may as wel reduce preaching to the reading over of the 10. commaundements, as praying to the reading of Our father. And as your preſcript leitourgies, ſo your conceiving of prayers otherwiſe, at your ſermons & other times, ſufficiently refuteth your own doctrine. You ſhal do wel therfore better to approve of your own doings, & to convince ours by the word of Chriſt, before you perſwade people to your cuſtome, & ſpeak evil of the way of truth with ſuch bitternes.

This hav we done to divers, and God hath confirmed it in heaven, & we hav ſeen it with comfort, in the converſion of many, & hardning of others that they hav grown worſe & worſe. 2.

Pet. ſhould be Balaams father; nor dare determin why Ioakim is left out, Math. 1. as your wiſdom is charged: & deſpiſe all Chriſtendome, muſt nedes be counted witles. Your doings ſhew that.

How, otherwiſe then citing him to Gods iudgment, & my ſelf. May not any to any do ſo? I did ſo 6. yeres agoe: and aſſured the Readers that they ſhould ſee him or me pay the price. So I excommunicate you. And for your befooling of vs for our Temples, ſobrietie ſhould be more in you then to require one man to teach you, where all Chriſtian lawes would put you to death. G. Iohnſon for whom I wrote to the B. of Dureſme, that I thought him tractable, & deſired that he might be ſuffred to come hither, vvas accuſed of turning the ſubiects from obedience, vpon contempt of our churches. And is dead: as one of New Castle vvrote, returning a letter ſent to

In this caſe no ſubiect vvill diſpute, one for all Chriſtians againſt you, vvheras you are leſſe then a vvorme, to all Chriſtendom, what ioy can a man have to tread dovvne ſuch: vvho preſently turne your coate, & ioyne vvith your adverſarie. Art vvould ſuffer in you but this: eyther to confeſſe your blindenes that denyed wooll to be in the Ephod; or to reſiſt directly: & not to bring a Satanean doubt. So for linen: vvhether you ment ſilk by it; or, as a dottrell, miſſed. In tvvo vvordes this might have ben done. You ſhake your ſelfe like a reed; and yeeld: & vvould be taught. Knovv you not that lavves kill you for your diſturbance paſſed, vnles you can perſvvade your Iudges, that is, all Chriſtendom, that they vvere Satanean. As I have made you yeeld in this, for woollen & linen, ſo you vvill turne your coate in every thing. Novv Archb. Wh. is the M. R. Father: confeſſe your errour, as he did: ſending M.

For ſo great is Satans rage, becauſe his time is now ſhort, as he omitteth no opportunitie or means to beat down the faith & fortreſſe of the church, vvhich maugre his ſpite, God wil vphold vnto the end. How I hav been drawen into this conflict vvith Mr Broughton, (a man that bendeth his wit & learning againſt this poor afflicted church,) may appear by my former vvritings. In what maner I hav caried my ſelf towards him, though I knevv him to be ſo great an enemie, & how he againe intreateth me, I leav it for them to judge that ſhal vievv the things paſſed.

He blameth me for not reſiſting directly; but I wil firſt diſcuſſe the matter, & as I ſhal find proof, ſo wil I ſpeak. I was charged with falſe doctrine for folowing the tranſlation of ſilk: It lieth on Mr Br. to prove his charge, which yet he hath not done, except reviling proveth it. He would hav me ſay, whither the white were linen or ſilk. I hav told him, (if he would take it) that I thinck it to be neyther of both properly as theſe things ar with vs; yet that it may be caled eyther of both. That it may be caled linen, himſelf granteth; that it may be caled ſilk through cuſtome of our tongue, I hav proved, & he anſwereth me not. Let him with the former, mind Straboos

               Having ended the ceremonie, next foloweth more weightie matters

of religion. Three points from amongſt al other Mr Br. choſe out to reprove vs for. 1. Our condemning of the idol Temples, which he caleth Holy buildings; 2. Our maner of praying, without ſaying over the form of words caled the Lords prayer; 3. and our excōmunication of ſome for declining to the corruptiōs in the Dutch church; by him reported, for baptiſing in the ſame. Of theſe things I wrote breefly for the cleering of our ſelves, & exſpected ſome great matter to follow, eſpecially from ſuch a man ſo renoumed for his learning: & the rather, for that theſe points ſeem much more juſtifiable againſt vs, then other evils that we reprove.
               But loe, he paſſeth over theſe things in ſilence, neyther bringing proof to convince vs, nor making word of anſwer to the ſcriptures that I alleged for our defence. Onely one point, that it ſeemeth went neer his hart, wher the blame that he ſought to bring vpon vs, I returned vpon his own head; to weet, his abuſe of Gods holy cenſure of excommunication: for this he would ſay ſomewhat, (which anone we wil examine,) but ere he had brought any one ſound reaſon, the fyre was kindled in his breſt, & he throvveth out an excommunication againſt me alſo: and then runneth into by matters, leaving the diſcuſſing of theſe things whereinto he was fallen, perhaps ere he was aware. Neyther was this ynough; but to find occaſion of new matter againſt me, whiles theſe writings wer vnder hand, he came vnto 
                     This his dealing, the party that told me, is ready to juſtify vnto his face if he ſhal deny it.
                   one amongſt vs, & enquired of him what doctrine I had taught touching the ſtones on Aarons breſtplate, & would hav vrged him vpon his oth to tel him; inſinuating that he knew I folowed the Geneva tranſlatiō, & conſequently muſt needs err. And though at this fiſhing he could find nothing againſt me; yet it ſeemeth the matter died not; for now ther flie abroad certain 
                     Of theſe writings, ſee hereafter, Pag. 24 &c
                   papers, wherin I am blamed with infinite errors for following our common tranſlation of the ſtones names, & the Geneva notes for placing them. To theſe writings I anſwer, that they conteyn a meer forgerie: I neyther folowed the Engliſh tranſlation in al the ſtones names, nor their application vnto the tribes according to the notes, as is knowen & wilbe teſtified by many that heard me, though it be now ſome yeres ſince I ſpake of that ſcripture. What vanitie then is this, to feighn firſt an accuſation, & then to frame a confutation of mens own fictions? How vnworthy is this dealing, I ſay not onely of a Chriſtian or learned man, but even of a man of ciuil or humane cariage? Nor yet did this fyre blaze ynough, but againe the bellowes muſt be put to it, & other 
                     Of theſe writings, ſee hereafter, Pag. 24 &c

hav ſo belyed me, & clear himſelf, or receiv with them the due deſert of falſe calumniation.

Neyther can I tel how many ſuch like lying papers they hav & wil ſpread concerning me: Onely this I know, that God wilbe judge & avenger of al ſuch wickednes; vnto him I commit my cauſe. And though they ſhal proceed in this their malice, yet rather then I vvil continually trouble my ſelf or the reader with ſuch fruitleſſe matters, I wil folow his example vvho in like vſage was 
                     Pſal. 38.13. 
                  as a deaf man that heard not, & as a dum man that opened not his mouth; & wil truſt that the Lord wil 
                     Pſal. 31.20. hide me in the ſecret of his preſence from the pride of men, & keep me ſecret in his tabernacle from the ſtrife of tongues.
               But vvho vvould think that a man thus ſetting himſelf to ſeek out error amongſt vs, and giving out papers vvith large confutations of forged matters, vvould be ſilent if he could except againſt our profeſſion in any point? yea that in the three things culled out by himſelf againſt our faith & practiſe he ſhould ſodainly be ſo mute? If he be not able to prove his cauſe againſt vs, let him yeild vnto the truth, & aſk mercie of God for the reproch vvherwith he vnjuſtly lodeth vs. If he thinck he can prove it, why ſeeketh he to ſet on foot nevv matters & leav the old? vviſe men wil ſoon ſee this vveak cariage. And is it not a vvorthy argument that he mentioneth for vpholding his idol temples, that al Christian lawes would put me to death, & therfore ſobriety ſhould be more in me then to require one man to teach me. Could not the Turk himſelf vvith this bloody reaſon quickly confute al Chriſtendome? and did not his predeceſſors the Papiſts fight vvith theſe weapons againſt Gods former witneſſes in their ſeveral ages? I perceiv now if the magiſtrates ſword wil not mainteyn theſe holy buildings, we ſhal hav no defence for them from Mr Broughton. Wel then, let Baal plead for himſelf againſt them that ſhal ruinate his howſes & altars. And wheras he thincketh it wil be no joy for him a man to tread down, me that am a worm; let him goe on to rejoyce in his manhood; I wil reſt contented with my portion in my ſaviours lot, who was before me

                  ed but falſe doctrine.
               
                  The commaundement of Chriſt doth plainly refute it, Mat. 18.15-17. where he willeth that our brethrēs ſin̄es ſhould firſt by our ſelves, next by witneſſes, thirdly by the church be convinced before excommunication. And Paul in a publick & moſt lothſome crime that was in Corinth, 
                  1. Cor. 5. willed the church when they wer gathered togither, to deliver the ſinner to Satan by the power of Chriſt. If one man may excommunicate an other, what vſe is ther of theſe lawes? yea what confuſion & vprore would it not breed amongſt men? And wher he aſketh how he did it otherwiſe then by citing the Biſhop & himſelf to Gods iudgement; ſhal we take him to mean that he excommunicated & curſed himſelf alſo at the ſame time: For againſt the Prelat thus he wrot & printed, 
                     In his book intitled, To the aged Sir, Iohn of Cant.
                   
                  You know you have the Anathema maranatha given you, it returneth to the giver if you deſerved it not; if your deſert be doubtleſſe, you ar ſurely miſerable. Now the Anathema maranatha is the dreadful ſentence which the Apoſtle inioyneth againſt ſuch as love not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which in our Engliſh Bibles is expreſſed by Execration & Excommunication to death, 1. Cor. 16.22. Can any man of judgemēt think that the church of Corinth ſhould no otherwiſe proceed againſt ſuch an enemie of Chriſt, then by citing him & themſelves to Gods judgement? In doubtful matters, & wher no proof or witneſſe is, an oth may end the ſtrife, & the thing be left vnto God, to judge & bring to light when pleaſeth him, as 
                     Exod. 22.11. 1 king. 8.31.32. Heb. 6.16. the ſcriptures teach: but in caſes of excommunication the ſin muſt be manifeſt, & ſinner obſtinate, & then he by the church through the power of Chriſt, delivered to Satan, that he may be humbled & aſhamed for his ſin, (if ſuch be the wil of God) & ſo returne to Chriſt & the church & be ſaved. And this cenſure the church executeth with full aſſurance of Gods good liking & approbation, knowing that he in heaven judgeth & bindeth the ſinner with them, as 
                     Mat. 18 18. he hath promiſed. If this certaintie muſt be of a mans wicked eſtate before excommunication, much more muſt it be, before the Maranatha. And as for Gods iudgement ſeat, we know that we muſt 2. Cor. 5.10. al there appear at that day, to receiv according to that we hav done: but excommunication is Gods judgement of ſinners in this life & world by his church; the power wherof is not left in any one mans hand, much leſſe in every mans, to excommunicat his neyghbour, & then to ſay, I have but cited him as my ſelf to Gods iudgement. But let vs ſerch a litle further into this his cenſure. He gav it to the ArchB. and then eyther he or himſelf, by his own graunt, was accurſed & miſerable. If the man be accurſed, ſo ar al his actions which he doth in that eſtate. Neyther may any Chriſtian hav ſpiritual or civil fellowſhip with one ſo caſt out, but muſt avoyd him, leaſt he partake with his puniſhment. The ſin of Achan in medling with the anathematized or excommunicat thing, brought wrath vpon the congregation of Iſrael: Ioſh. 7. The ArchB. was chief Paſtor of the church of England; he being accurſed, al his adminiſtration muſt needs be abominable, & they that joyned with or ſubmitted vnto it, were defiled. Thus Mr Broughton being but one man, & an inferior miniſter, hath of his own authoritie, caſt out of communion from

Chriſt & his church, (as himſelf eſtemeth it,) from King, Queen, Coūſel & the whol Realm, their Archpaſtor & metropolitan, without their conſent, & if any of them hav ſince that his curſed eſtate communicated with him in doctrine, prayer, ſacraments, or any other part of his eccleſiaſtical function, which extended over al the land, they communicated with an enemie of Chriſt & member of Satan: and if any Biſhop or other miniſter hav received eccleſiaſtical office from him, they received it from the Divil & not from Chriſt. This bleſſing & benefit hath Mr Br. brought vpon his countrie. He ſaith, lawes kil me for diſturbance: but let this his preſumptuous dealing be looked into, that thus intermedleth without lawful caling, or any juſt maner of proceeding to excommunicat the Archpaſtor of al the realm; & let men of place mind, whither his diſturbāce paſt & preſent, deſerveth not rather the ſword which he ſo maliciouſly would bring vpon his neighbour; & whither I had not juſt cauſe to ſay, that himſelf would be found to be the wicked excommunicator? If others ſhould beleev & practiſe this his doctrine, one man may curſe an other, & none ſhal know almoſt with whom he may live or walk in communion. For if any man anger his neighbour a litle, (as I have angred Mr Broughton) his neighbour may preſently excommunicat him, (as this man hath done me,) & a miniſter may curſe the greateſt man in the land. But now if the Archb. wer not juſtly & lawfully curſed, then Mr Br. ſayth it returneth to the giver; & then himſelf hath been ever ſince that day, & ſo ſhal continew til he get out by repentance, a curſed wight, & one that hath given himſelf over to Satan by wicked excommunication. Betwixt himſelf & his moſt reverend Father the curſe then doth lie; & between them let it reſt.
               The effects folowing his excommunication ar next to be minded. He aſſured the readers, that they ſhould ſee the Archb. or himſelf pay the price. Would he hav men expect miracles by his hands, as if ſome great plague ſhould folow the man tht he curſeth, or els himſelf? The word of God teacheth vs to look for no ſuch thing by the excommunication of a whole church, much leſſe of one man; but rather to hope for the ſinners converſion & ſalvation by means of this cenſure; or otherwiſe to leav him to Gods judgement, without looking for corporal puniſhment vpon him in this life. For God often ſuffreth wicked here to flouriſh long, & go down in peace to the grave, when he layeth his rod & ſtrokes vpon his own beloved children. And if he pleaſe to lay any judgement vpon the wicked here on earth, yet he reſerveth ſuch things to his own ſecret counſel, & wil not hav them expected from the mouth of man. Let Mr Br. then look how he preſumeth thus to limit the Lords judgements betwixt his neighbour & himſelf, leaſt the evil light on his own head. It ſeemeth becauſe the Archb. is dead, this man thincketh he payed the price of his curſe; & if himſelf had firſt died, the reader muſt hav judged his curſe killed him ſelf. Wel let him beware he curſe not many, leaſt ſome of them do out live him, & he dynig without repentance giv the world occaſion to thinck he died accurſed, & ſurely miſerable
                  ▪
               
               
                  Yet let th' effects folowing, be minded of the reader as he willed him. For the Archb. as he ſayth, confeſſed his error; I hope then Mr Br. was not ſo vnmerciful but to forgiv him, except he count his ſin to be againſt the Holy ghoſt,
                     
                        
                           •
                        at. 12. vnpardonable. If he forgaue him, & after it the Archb. died; a man may ſuppoſe he died rather vpon Mr Broughtons bleſſing then his curſe; if any would think he killed him, as himſelf now often boaſteth.
               His Bull of excommunication given out againſt my ſelf, I deſire alſo may be conſidered.
               Firſt he ſayth no ſubject wil diſpute, one for al Chriſtians againſt me: yet he being but one, wil excommunicate me.
               2. If I were to be excommunicat, it muſt be for ſin wilfully perſiſted in; ſuch he hath not proved to be in me; neyther wilbe brought to prove by Gods word any thing he ſayth.
               3. Mr Br. being a member & miniſter of the church of England, I am none of his brethren, nor any fellow member with him of that bodie, which we witneſſe againſt not to be a true gathered & conſtituted church of Chriſt. What authoritie then hath he over me, except he be a Pope & claymeth power over all churches?
               4. No falſe Prophet or antichriſtian miniſter, hath the power of the keyes, or right to adminiſter the word or cenſures of Chriſt. Such is Mr Br. having received a falſe miniſterie or preiſthood at the hands of his right reverend Fathers the Prelates: which miniſterie we hav diſproved in many writings publiſhed; & Mr Broughton himſelf wil not & cannot approve his own function.
               5. We ar counted ſchiſmaticks & out of the church: & of me, he ſayth I have given my ſelf to Satan by wicked excommunication. If it be ſo, I am not within, but without the church already, & therfore cannot be caſt out of that communion in which I am not. Now the Apoſtle Paul & the whol church of Corinth had no authoritie to judge them that wer without, but onely them that wer within; & God judgeth thoſe without, 1 Cor. 5.12.13. But Mr Br. in judging & excommunicating me, (if I be ſuch as he eſteemeth me,) hath taken vpon him more power then the Apoſtle had, & preſumeth to do that vvhich perteyneth to God.
               6. That which he ſayth to the ArchB. if you deſerved it not, it returneth to the giver; let him apply to himſelf in this caſe. If I hav deſerved it, it is for ſin: al ſin muſt be diſcouered & judged by Gods law; & the ſinner wilfull. With me he refuſeth to debate the matter; how am I then convinced of ſin, or deſerv I this cenſure? What then ſhal I ſay; ſhal I wiſh it may turn to the giver? Shal I ſay, 
                     Pſal. 109.17.18. 
                  As he loved curſing ſo ſhal it come vnto him, & as he loved not bleſſing, ſo ſhal it be far from him; as he clothed himſelf with curſing like a rayment, ſo ſhal it come into his bowels like water, & like oyl into his bones? I wil rather reward this man good for his evil towards me, & pray God he may find grace repentance & mercie, becauſe I hope he hath done this ignorantly; if otherwiſe, he ſhal

receiv the more heavie judgement. For doubtleſſe God that wil not hold any man guiltleſſe that ſhal take his name in vayn; vvil not ſuffer this great profanation of his name & cenſure to go vnpuniſhed, except the ſinner purge himſelf by vnfeighned repentance.
               As for me, I hav otherwiſe learned Chriſt, then to fear the curſe 
                     Prov. 26.2. cauſleſſe, or to be affrayd of vain-man, vvhoſe breth is in his noſthrils. The Lord promiſed to

                  And firſt from Aharons attire: afterwards for all Exod. & Ebrew and Greek ſtudies: ſhewing that he ſhould do better to learne yet 20. yeares, then beeing blind to lead the blind into ditches.

Alſo the beſt Rabbins of Chriſtians vpon the great Plantine Bible in many places might have forced him to have perceived his blindnes.

                     1. He thinketh that white ſilk & white linen is all one. So blew ſilk &c. and blew linen: and he maketh no conſcience in having deceived his hearers: & careth not for the Law of leaving open a well into which the vnheedy may fall.
                     2. Becauſe in private garments, Levit. 19. diuerſe ſtuff is forbidden, he dreameth Aharons Ephod had not diverſe ſtuffe. And will beleve the Scripture rather then all Iewes conſent: as though the Scripture expounded the tongue: the Old T. the Heb. and the New T. the Greke.
                     3. He might as well ſay Aharons Ephod had no golden thred; becauſe Levit. 19. diverſe ſtuff in garments is forbidden.

There alſo according to the tribes cariage, the order is given: that Ruben & Ioſeph both, loſe ſupremacie, Ioſeph for Ieroboam: & Beniamin by right cometh in the firſt foundation: which Ioſeph ſhould have had: Iuda becauſe of our high ſacrificer hath the place of Levi, & Levi of Iudah: Symeon alwayes baſe is reiected into the ninth: & Iſachar hath his place: Next of order after all three of Lea cometh Zabulom & ſixtly Ruben to come afore the handmaydes ſonnes: Then Aſer for Anna that ſhewed Chriſt preſent: then Ioſeph, that in his Berylls two held 6. & 6. Then Symeon: Then Nephthali for Barack before his elder brother Dan: & he, as by birth afore Gad. By the ſtones names the tribes are aſwell meant as yf their names were engraven into them.
                     1. M. Ainſworthes tranſlation leaveth this heavenly matter as nothing belonging to Aharons care of Iudgment: which he ware on his breſt: or to the providence of Chriſt for all the tribes ſtorie.

Theſe eight, heathen have: & the Lxx. in ſenſe as Rabbines would expound Ebrew: & the holy Ghoſt alloweth them. Wilfull deſpiſing of the holy Ghoſt is flat Atheiſme: Blindnes not learning muſt M. Ainſworth plead.
                  
                  
                     Of foure Iewels names: altered from the Septuagintaes, Apoc. 21.
                     Foure names of ſtones the Lxx. brought, which the holy Ghoſt reiecteth. Apoc. 21.
                     Nophec, the ſtone of Iudah, is Anthrax, in the Lxx. But Chalcedon in the Apoc. as Andreas Caeſar thervpon noteh by the order of the ſtones: And God alloweth Tharg. Ieruſalemy: vpon Exod. 28. vvhere Nophec is Chadcedona.
                     
                     Iahalom, the ſtone of Zabulon, was Iaſpis in the Lxx. Though Iaſpe in Ebrew, was Beniamins. God giveth Zabulon the Sardonyx: the hardeſt next the Diamond, & fit for the notation of Iahalon: named of abiding the hammer & of Beating. Therin the Apoſtle maketh heathen, as holy, by applying an heathen terme to a ſtrange Hebrew.
                     Shebo vvas Achates: in the Lxx. and Nepthali was engraven in it. The Chryſopraſe is a white achate green on the one ſide: with a golden liſt: that doth God bring for the Achat: Apoc. 21. So Thalmudique & Apoſtolique Greek is here.
                     Iaſpe of Beniamin, hath Apoc. 21. Iaſpis: & the ſonne laſt in Birth: but of the firſt betrothed wife, hath the firſt foundation.
                     Hovv far Mr. Ainſworth hath ben from fitting theſe names: his ovvne hart and his hearers can tell. And all who be not cauterized in hart will confeſſe that God is much contemned, in that his tranſlation was not regarded. Yet Mr Ainſworth follovving the interlineal of Aria
                              •
                            Montanus, yet refuſing him & all of eſteeme for wool throd, vvill with ſaucy malapertſhip rather caſt of all this then confeſſe how babiſh hee is for lerning. Yf he dare replie, he vvill ſhevv himſelf to be as a man giddy in a tempeſt: not knovving vvhat to ſpeak, nor vvhat to affirme. He that checketh him, vvill adventure his fame that ſo it vvill fall out.
                     
                        And this much to ſhew what a Babe Mr. Ainſworth vvill ſhew himſelf for twelve dum ſtones: to be as dum as they: or a Nabal, if he plead he may deſpiſe the holy Gh. his tranſlation. He is like to be guilty of further errour.
                  
               
               
                  How the Patriarches were to be grauen in the two Berylles: and in the 12. ſeuerall ſtones.
                  Our Geneva, and Church Bible, and Tremelius, in theyr wordes beare this ſenſe that they vvere to be engraven according to their birth: they firſt vvho firſt came into the vvorld. It is marveyle that Tremelius vvas ſo ſimple. Philo of Alexandria vvho ſaw the Ephod, placeth Iſachar in the Saphir: which by birth Dan ſhould have had. And baſe Dan ſhould have had in the Saphir, the ſecond foundation in the Revelation: And noble Iſachar, the place of baſe Gad, and the laſt in the Revelation. Yf Mr Ainſworth will affirme that he rightly fitted the Patriarches to their ſtones: the writer of this vvill highly renowme him. Yf he miſſed, he diſturbed, Ioſuah, Ezek. Apoc. and all light of the holy ſtorie: which chayneth the ſtories of the Patriarches birthes, & life: and their ſonnes poſſeſſions, and cariage, and regard from God, all together.
               
               
                  Of Exod. v.1. vnmarked.
                  Exod. Chap. 1. ſetteth all Leahs ſonnes together: and only Iſachar & Zabulon move the doubt: vvhither they follow Iudah: or come after the foure handmaids in the ſtones: The Rabbines in the Thalmud conſent, ſhevv that thence Moſes taught hovv by kindreds all together, as the firſt had ſeniority of birth, the terme Tholedoth vvas to be expounded. And they ſavv extreme abſurdities, if that vvere not obſerved.
               
               
                  Of Heathens natiue light for Heroaldry.
                  Poets Greek & Latin compare Mans caſe vvith reſemblance in Naturall things fit to all iudgmentes. Ouid in deſcribing the Sunnes pallace, obſerved that: and in deſcription of Slepe, of Envy, and in all his tranſformations. Moſes & the holy Prophets allegories are extremely perfect & pleaſant in that kind. And for Aharons attire, the Rabbines, by Naturall heroaldry, and by the Prophets, ſpeak the ſame, that the holy Apoſtles doe from God. The vvhite linen, the Helmet or Bonet of ſalvation, the ſtraite girding of the loynes, Vrim & Thūmim in faith & love, the building of the Temple, & ſighting for the Church, & teaching the covenant of ſalvation meant by a throne holder, like Iaſper and Ruby,

with a rainebow like a rainebow, and bearing of Gods name in the forehead: theſe ſhew in the New Teſt: what Aharons attyre meant. And moſt of this have the Prophets, and alſo the Rabbines. And nether Prophetes the doubtleſſe warrant, nor Rabbines, auctours for phraſe commonly allowed by the Rabbines, ever took the worme for ſignification of cleannes. As in Greeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Chamerpes earth-creaper, is a name of ſlaviſh and earthly affection.
                  And our Lordes ſuffrings were taught by Blew ſcarlat and krimſon: fit for blood of al ſorts: and white for good ſucceſſe in iuſtice. And if he had ben to deſcend to hell, black ſhould have reſembled that. And why no Iron was in the Tabernacle: Plato & Tullie would ſoone ſee. Iron, is an inſtrument of vvarres, not an ornament of a Temple. So where in Daniels Image, warres of 300 yeres betwixt the two legges, Seleucidae & Lagida ſhould be ſtill for Iudea, toſſed and ſcattered on both ſides, Iron was a ſenſible note: and not gold ſilver nor braſſe, to expreſſe that. He that marketh this may bring the like wit to the twelve ſtones: how they vvere fit in badges: and ſhew that he beareth choſen Miſpat, the care of right judgment on his breſt: and girdeth vp his loines like a man, to fight the good combat of God.
               
               
                  Of Iacobs ſonnes by his noble Wife, & baſe Handmaydes.
                  Chriſt, Prov. 8. delighteth to play with the ſonnes of Adam. Not with the vvicked: of whom he ſaith: that it repenteth him, he made man. But in the godly he delighteth: as he wreſtled with Iacob: and before ſhewed him a Lather: reaching from the earth to the heavens: & 20. yeres ſhewing heavenly favour ſtrengthned the godly Patriark: & after in all varieties was ſtill with him. In ſuch Chriſt his delight is. So in precious dum ſtones he ſpeaketh the Patriarkes ſtorie. Of noble Lea, be two vvarriers, two ſeamen, two ſtateſmen. Of the two handmaides, each hath, a warrier, and a borderer vpon ſea. The noble Rachel hath tvvo noble ſtate tribes. Of Leah, Ruben the eldeſt had his land vpon the enimies: as bound to fight for his brethren. So Symeon, a warrier againſt Sychem vvas placed vpon Amalek: & gate from Amalek many townes, and did Ruben from the Hagarenes. Dan of Rachels handmayd gate & held Leſhem the towne, by vvarre. & G
                           •
                        d of Leahs handmayd, was in a Playn, nere Ruben, bordered vpon the Enemie: that garriſons might warre ſtill with him. Sea-men were tvvo of Leahs, Iſachar and Zabulon whom Iacobs tongue placed vpon the middle ſea. Aſer of Leahs handmaid was placed with them: and Nephthaly of Rachels mayd, held Tyberias ſea, a bleſſing, vpon which Chriſt vvalked. And Rachels two ſonnes had noble glorie, Ioſeph in Ieſus conquered the land: & his tribes had long glorie: And though Rachel ſoone dyed for a ſpice of Idolatrie, in travell: yet Beniamin had the temple

in his tribe: And Levi ſerved there in holy vvorke: And noble Iudah built the temple, and long held the kingdome.
               
               
                  The 12. ſtones, anſwering the tribes caſe.
                  The tvvelve ſtones are fit: The VVarriers red, or vvith ſome vvarre-note: the Seamens fit: Ioſephs moſt ſit in clear Beryll: and Beniamins in the Iaſper: and Levy in the Phoebean Iaſper, Ovid. Met. 2. and Iuda in the flaming Carbuncle. Mr. Ainſvvorth his ovvne hart can beſt tell vvhether he knevv Moſes purpoſe, Exod. 1.1. to ſet all Leahs ſonnes together: that Dan ſhould have Leſhem: or vvanted learned ſight to avoyd our ttanſlations errours, and to follovv the lerned Rabbines deep ſkill herein. But I am afrayd the bare narration of this, vvill rather drive him to ſome ſaucy malapert raving, then beate any vvit into his vnlerned head: vvho yet vvill needes be geving counſell to others hovv to learne Hebrevv, by impudency to hide his ignorance.
               
               
                  Of Ezech. chap. 28. vſing 9, of the 12. ſtones.
                  Ezechiel telleth of old Chyram king of Tyrus how in David and Salomons tyme he had the vvhole dignity of Iſrael in Gods people, and holy tribes: and leaveth out only three handmaydes: as beginning of noble, and ſtill aſcending: taking in no handmaydes tribe, but happy Aſers, his borderer. Nepthali, Dan, God, the three laſt Apoc. 21, Ezechiel of force leaveth out: as not obbrading baſe dignities. If M. Ainſworth had not Rabbines help here: Aharons breſt had litle hart from his lerning, & he may ſay he obſcured Exodus, but could not open the firſt verſe, as the Thalmud vvould profitably have taught him the right.
               
               
                  Of Badgers.
                  
                     Badgers ſkin our Genevah hath for the tabernacle: But the Biſhops amended that into Taxus. It is an ox kind beaſt, Ezech. 20. whoſe leather is the beſt for brave ſhoes: and not the vnclean. How Mr. Ainſworth quit him ſelf therein: whether he ſtayned all trope of Ceremonies therin, or playd the man, his owne hart, and his hearers will cenſure.
               
               
                  Of the Candleſtick.
                  Hebrewes note well, that all the ſtories in the Bible after the firſt ſix dayes of creation, & fall, & ſeaventh of reſt, in mens glorie or ſhame

have relation to the order of creation ſtill calling men to conſider that. So in Henoch, Heber & Iſaak noble ſhort life, and holy long life: & ſhort by will but long of Gods ſtay, bare all glorie. & 777 in Lamech: and 600 was ſad in Noah: & 6 tymes ſeaven is often for to teach triall or experience. So 42. yeares after the land was parted brought Chuſan a full ſeaven yeares oppreſſour: but in the Iubily Othoniel ſhewed God had his time. The Candleſtick had 22. bowles; 11. knoppes; nyne flowres: the 42. devoured of two beares: the 42. kild with Ochoſia; the 42. Mat. 1. are lernedly obſerved for number as not commonly caſt. And the Candleſtick but by Iewes had never ben marked. And if one diſh knop, or flower want, they hold all maymed: as no help to ſtory. Here Ainſworth may bable as he cannot but prate: But if he had conſcience as a graine of muſtard ſeed he would not be a doctor.
               
               
                  Of girding about the breſt.
                  Our L. Apoc. 1. was girded about the breſt: Ainſwoth Exod 28. was to have ſhewed why? & by what cuſtome Rabbines there would have told him. But the Bat & Mowleward will teach that which he never learned. They that like of him are like vnto him: & all that put any truſt in him. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                  
               
               
                  Concluſion.
                  He cannot as an Ebrician or Grecian in lerned ſcholes would, grammatically expound one line of ether Teſtamēt: Such a mate ſhould not befoole all that goe and went 1500. yeres to churches as ſome yet ſtand.
               
               
                  To the Engliſh company that hold M. Ainſworth of ſome worth forlerning.
                  YOu report that Ainſworth taught vpon Exod. 12.40. that Iſrael was in Egypt 430 yeares. And one no better lerned then he, would ſo expound the Ebrew. For Moyſes in a matter knowen, would vſe a ſhort bravery of ſpeach, that heathen ſhould not brable for 215 yeres ſpent in Chanaan for 70. ſoules: & 215 in Egypt for ſix hundreth thouſand valiant men: But left his ſpeach ſhort. Novv if your reportes of M. Ainſworth be true, marke his dulneſſe. Cohath, Exod 6. is Moſes grandfather. He came with Iacob into Egypt, Gen. 46. All his yeres were but 133. Exod. 6. Amram was his proper and immediate ſonne, Exod. 6. He lived but 137 yeres, Exod. 6. Moſes was his next and immediate ſonne. He lived but 120 yeares. Deut. 31.
                  
                     133
                     137

                     390
                  
                  
                     So Moſes ſhould be dead, before the Law was geven, 40. yeares: & all religion grounded vpon Moſes ſhould he fables: by M. Ainſworth: vnleſſe he turne: as he did for wool▪ & linnen in Aharons attire. wherein if againe he will revolt, let him confute Arias Montanus folowing the vniverſall Iewes conſent.
               
               
                  How M. Ainſworth denyeth the New T.
                  S. Paul ſayth, Gal. 3.17. That the Law came 430. yeres, after the promiſe, that in Chriſt all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: So

                        Yeres are to Iſaaks byrth
                        25
                        To Iacobs
                        60
                        To his in Egypt afore Pharaoh
                        130
                         
                        215
                        And ſo of neceſſitie in Egypt but
                        215
                         
                        430 all.
                     
                  
                  Thus ether M. Ainſworth muſt eat his wordes or be guilty of reiecting all Moſes as a fable: and be as a man forlorne of God: that will be teaching of others being ſo far from all hope of lerning and wit.
               
               
                  To the company of folk that hold M. Ainſworth of worth to teach Divinity.
                  1. MR. Ainſw. hath ben reproved for not teaching that the blew purple & ſcarlat in the Ephod was vpon woollen thred, by the vniverſall conſent of the Iewes: wherof ſome recordes vvere 500. yeares old, vvhyle the nation yet beheld with theyr eyes what was done.
                  Mr. Ainſw. careth not for ſuch a teſtimonie. S. Luke thought theyr teſtimony ſufficient for Nathans houſe & for Zorobabels twiſe: and they who know not when humane teſtimonies be as ſtrong as need to be, ſhould not teach Divinity.
                  Arias Montanus & his fellowes who dealt in the great Bible, which turned the Thalmud Dictionarie & all the Chaldy Paraphraſtes into Latin, vvhoſe lerning herein all Chriſtendome followeth, vvere cited againſt him. But with himſelf his owne aucthority is more.
                  Here you muſt ſee what ſuch a man is.
                  2. The white vvas told him to be linen.
                  
                  He aunſwereth that by ſilk he meant flaxen fine Linen. How well iudge your ſelves.
                  
                     3. He taught you, vnleſſe his hearers be impudent, that Iſrael was 430 yeres in Egypt; as our Engliſh tranſlation goeth. So Moſes ſhould be dead 40. before the Law: & all his writing ſhould be fables.
               
               
                  Vnthankfulnes.
                  They who know what long agoe I wrote, & firſt opened in Engliſh: and how he taught the ſame, never mentioning whence he was taught, & hovv yee moſt admired him for that, think him an vnthankfull wight, & you very ſimple.
                  4. XX yeres agoe, the time of Adams fall, that he fell his firſt day, was holden a wonder: till I ſhewed how the Iewes vniverſally & many Greekes and old Latines hold that. M.A. could find prayſe for that which he never ſtudied.
                  The vvhole Chronicle, and the ſetling of the Iubilies, with our Lordes death, & plaine reconciling of the two, S. Math. & S. Luke, and diſtinguiſhing of Daniels Beaſtes & them of Apoc. was not taught vncontrolled, till in my Scripture concent I handled the matters. For this, glory, Ainſw. would take, but give no thankes.
                  5. He cometh 20. yeres ſhort of Eb. & Greke: That will I ſoone prove.
                  6. He thinketh that the Goſpell hath a New diſcipline: The Iewes tell all, all was in the Synagoges before Ezraes time & while Ieruſalem ſtood. All his ſtudy here tottereth.
                  7. His labor tendeth to overthrow this ſtate. Holding no true church to be here. This dealing is ſtark bad.
                  8. He knoweth not what the Bible is. He hath ſuffred you to vſe, Math. 1. Ioſias begate Iehoiakim, and Iehoiakim begate Iechonias. S. Mathewes true copies have not Ioakim. And the Iewes would ſwear that God neuer penned the N. Teſt: if Ioakim were honored there: He that kild Vriah the Prophet, & would have killed Ieremy, & brent Ieremies Lamentations, & was buried like an aſſe: condemned by the Iewes whole conſent, that he is gone to eternall deſtruction.
                  9. And if Ioas, with his father Vzias & Amaſias, better all then he, be left out, it were ſtrange that Ioakim ſhould be in. Some trifling copier, knowing that he was indeed ſonne to Ioſias, & father to Iechonias, put him in: not knowing why S. Mathew left him out. The Greke copies far the greater part: & all tranſlations, the old Latin, the Arabique, the Syriaque, the Ethiopian, leave him out. And the drawing of him into S. Mathew, ſhuffleth the condemned ſtate of the Kinges, to have of theyr company one, among the bleſſed Private of Nathans houſe to diſturbe the whole argument of S. Mathew & of all the New Teſt: which teacheth the kingdomes of this world are ful of imperfections. Of this M. Ainſw: vvas vvarned. Then he runneth to a diſcourſe of M. Bezaes fame: as though reſpect of perſon might be in examining the truth: & wher Beza condemneth himſelf: M. A. will ſpeak for him. M. Beza at the laſt ſaw & revoked his moſt deadly errour.
               
               
                  
                  Of 848 margent readings in Eb.
                  848 Margent readings be in the Old Teſt: ſome of our men following Da: Kimchi. praf. to Ioſ. held them warninges that a word in the text was there, corrupted. The Iewes damned Kimchi of Atheiſme for that: & taught him to yeild reaſons of the Text & Margent, afterwards. And though Arias was caught once therin: yet in ſome of his copies that is omitted. By ignorance herein often contrarieties ſeem to be in Gods word: As 14 tymes where 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the Negative & 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the Affirmative come both: as Exod. 21. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     hath not betrothed her: 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         hath taken her for his. When M.A. can tell how the Bible is in both, Gods word, then hold him lerned. Till then let him choſe a fitter match to diſpute with him.
               
               
                  Of Rabbines vnknowen.
                  The Ebrew is all loſt: ſaving ſo much as the Old Test: hath: And theſe auctors we have that help vs: The New Test: expounding many a thouſand word of the Old: wherof I will lend M. Iohnſon a Dictionarie compiled by my ſelf: Next the Lxx. Thirdly the Thalmud Ieruſalimy: & the Babylonian: the compilers whereof ſtill kept the tongue in theyr ſcholes: One man after the Apoſtles dayes ioyned all: But the fragments were from age to age ſynce Babelended Ebrew. Without judgment herein, a teacher muſt vſe other mens ſpectacles. Endles millions of hard trickes hath the holy tongue: as fitted to Adams wit to wher vs: where, but for the Iewes, whoſe millions ſpent their life to mark ſhort ſpeches, our ſhort life would come ſhort. M. A. deſpiſing Rabbines herein ſhewes himſelf. Force his ſhort vnſuperfluous aunſwer to this. Then for the New T. I will as much charge him.

               Mr Henry Ainſvvorth his See before, in Pag. 18. other anſvver concerning the vvritings aforeſaid. An Anſwer to the Articles of vnlernedſhip obiected to me by Mr Broughton.
               ALthough the conſcience of mine own infirmities and ignorāce, who knovv nothing yet as I ought to know, but come far ſhort of the vviſdom of the learned both before time and in theſe my dayes, vvould ſtay me from making any anſwer to theſe Articles, whoſe title pretend want of learning only, and are to no other end penned or ſpred but for my reproch, which I can be cōtent to bear in my boſome: yet becauſe I ſee many of them to conteyn beſides malice, moſt manifeſt lies and forgeries; & to tend vnto the diſgrace of Gods truth & diſcredit of his Church vnto vvhom they vver ſent, & vvhom the author vvould vrge to force my direct anſwer, vvhich he preſumeth I cannot make, yea dareth me, & vvill he ſayth adventure his fame I will ſhew my ſelf as a giddy man, and not knowing what to ſpeak; I have thought it needfull to ſhevv the vanitie and falſhood of theſe his obiections; vvhich if my accuſer himſelf vvill not lay to hart, yet others of diſcretion may eaſily perceiv.
               
                  Of the question about ſilk.
                  In opening Exodus, I followed our common tranſlations of ſilk, to expreſſe that Aegyptian ſtuff which is now not vſed nor known amongſt vs. For this word, a clamour of error was rayſed, and I charged with falſe doctrine. Mr Broughton affirmed ſilk to be vnclean & vnlawfull in ceremonie; and ſayd the matter was linen and woollen threed. Of this, ſome writings paſſed between him and me, vnto which I refer the Reader. His Articles collected from my writings, are:
                  
                     1. That I think white ſilk & white linen is all one: ſo blew ſilk & blew linen &c. Anſw. I think not ſilk and linen to be one, but very different things: yet that the Ebrew 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Sheſh, and the Greek byſſe, may be caled eyther of both without danger of error. This I proved by ſundry reaſons yet vnanſwered.
                  2. That becauſe in private garments, Levit. 19. divers ſtuff is forbidden, I dream Aarons Ephod had not divers ſtuff, and will beleev the ſcripture rather then all Iewes conſent &c. Anſw. I obiected againſt linen and woollen, Gods law Deut. 22.11. where ſuch garments were in expreſſe wordes forbidden all men; ther Moſes explaneth the former place of Levit. and I will in deed beleev the ſcripture, & Moſes own expoſition, befo
                        •
                     e all Iewiſh Rabbines that ſhall teach otherwiſe.
                  3. That I might as well ſay, Aarons Ephod had no golden threed, becauſe Lev. 19. divers ſtuff in garments is forbidden. Anſw. I doubt not of golden threed, the ſcripture is playn, Exod. 39.3. But wooll Mr Broughton granteth is not in the text: why then ſhould I be charged with error for not admitting wooll. I ſhewed expreſſe wordes in Ezekiel, wher the Prieſtes might not wear wooll in their adminiſtration, Ezek. 44.17. I granted alſo God might diſpenſe with that law, Deut. 22.11. if hee would; let his will be ſhewed, & I yeild. Further let Mr Br. affirme & prove that by that law, Lev. 19. gold with linen is forbidden as woollen with linen. His Rabbines 
                        VVhich, hold 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            that nothing 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            is forbidden but woollen & linen. Munſter. praecep. prohib. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      here will fayl him.
                  4. That for an Ebrew word I dare take againſt all Ebrewes. Anſw. Not ſo, but I ioyne with the beſt that I hav yet ſeen, & ar moſt conſonant to the ſcriptures.
                  5. That for a Iewes law, and open ſtorie, I prefer mine own pate againſt all Iewes that ever handled Moſes. Anſw. A Iewes law and open ſtorie to prove ſilk vnclean, and proper linen and woollen in Aarons attire, hath not yet ben ſhewed. Tremellius a learned Iew I prefer before his inferiors.
                  6. That I deſpiſe this Law, The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in the chayr of Moſes: ſo hear them. Anſw. The Scribes and Phariſees of whom Chriſt ſpake, I have not yet heard ſpeak againſt me: much leſſe deſpiſed Chriſtes law. Let it be proved that they taught ſuch things as Mr Broughton affirmeth, and that they did it according to Moſes Law. Let it alſo be proved that Chriſt ſendeth vs for inſtructiō to ſuch Rabbines as ſhould come after.
                  7. That the Apoſtles never in termes force do leave the Rabbines ſkill; but I wil be wiſer &c. Anſw. The Apoſtles left the Lxx. interpretors ſkill in the termes & names of ſome ſtones, Rev. 21. as Mr Br. himſelf confeſſeth▪ much leſſe did they follow the Thalmud and later Rabbines which have riſen vp ſince the Apoſtles left this world.
                  8. That the Lxx. Exod: 28. have byſſon 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , & the Apoc: alloweth it; yet I

                     Sheſh may be caled byſſe. Wherin then am I dāned?
                  9. That I can teach all men Engliſh, that white linen and white ſilk is all one. Anſw: This Article ſerveth to encreaſe the number, what differeth it from the firſt? I teach no other Engliſh then I have learned, & others, I think, with me; namely that byſſe may be caled fine linen or ſilk; yet not that theſe two are all one. Let Scholes & Dictionaries ſpeak for Engliſh; and Strabo

                           ib. 15. for Greek.
                  10 That by me, ſilk conteyneth linen and the wormes threed, as hades heaven and hell. Anſw. A falſe collection. I ſayd not ſo, but that ſilk is a general name as wel for that which naturally groweth, as for that which the worm worketh. Let my former writing be looked vpon.
                  11. That 
                        See before Pag 31. 
                     the vniverſal conſent of the Iewes, wherof ſome recordes were 500 yeres old &c were alleged, but I care not for ſuch a teſtimonie. Anſw: Such things I have heard ſpoken of, but their teſtimonie is yet to allege; let Mr Broughtons former writings & proofs bee viewed.
                  12. That * Arias Montanus & his fellowes who dealt in the great Bible &c. we
                           •
                        e cited againſt me; but with my ſelf myne own authoritie is more. Anſw. I know not where Arias condemneth ſilk to be vnclean. He ſpeaketh of

                     wooll following the Rabbines, but nameth not what maner wooll: neyther yet doth Mr Broughton himſelf, that the ſtrife might be ended. Beſides, he ſendeth me to Arias about the queſtion of ſilk; but blames me for following him in the ſtones names. Thus vſeth he learned men for his own advantage; if they bee with him, they are more then mountaines, if againſt him, they are leſſe then molhills. I would the Bible might decide all controverſies of religion.
               
               
                  Of Iſraels ſoiourning in Aegypt.
                  A falſe report Mr Br. received againſt me, that I ſhould teach that Iſrael was in Aegypt 430. yeres. They that heard me on Exod. 12. & remember my doctrine, can reprove this his vntruth; and ſome have already to his face witneſſed the contrarie; yet doth he not retract or call back his ſlanderous writing. Let him name my accuſers touching this, except he will have men think himſelf feighned it. A large confutation he maketh of this error, that he may bee ſeen to build caſtles in the aire. But why doth the man ſo ſkirmiſh with ſhadowes, and fight where he hath no adverſarie? hee hath poyntes of doctrine vnder my own hand, which he firſt reproved & I have iuſtified; why dealeth he not with them, but foloweth after leaſings?
               
               
                  Of a new diſcipline.
                  Mr Br. ſayth, I think the Goſpel hath a new diſcipline &c. and all my ſtudie here tottereth. I anſwer, what I hold of the diſcipline, as he caleth it, is to

be ſeen in the Confeſsion of our faith & our dayly practiſe. Againſt this he hath yet proved nothing, And I doubt not, through Gods grace, but out building will ſtand, when all Babels towres ſhall totter and fall.
               
               
                  Of overthrowing this ſtate.
                  Hee ſayth my labour tendeth to overthrow this ſtate, holding no true church to be here, & that this dealing is ſtark bad. I anſwer, Mr Br. dealeth like Sanballat, Neh. 6. We have ever ſought the good of this ſtate & country, and no way the overthrow or hurt thereof. We hold here to be many true Churches, Dutch & French; which yet have their corruptions, from which we deſire they were purged. Mr Br. can neyther iuſtifie their corruptions, nor yet would have them amended. This dealing is ſtark bad; and his belying of me is no better.
               
               
                  Of the 12 ſtones.
                  1. He chargeth me with infinit errors, for following the Geneva tranſlation of the ſtones names &c. Anſw. I followed not that tranſlation in all; neyther can he prove that I followed it in any one amiſſe: ſo his ſuppoſed errors vaniſh into lies.
                  2. In another place he ſayth, I followed the interlineal tranſlation of Arias Montanus. Anſw. This vntruth croſſeth the former: Arias differeth from the Genevah, if I followed him, how then followed I the other? neyther yet followed I Arias in them all.
                  3 Again he ſayth, My owne h
                           •
                        r
                           •
                         & my hourers can tell how far I have been from fitting the names. Anſw. Thus when he can prove nothing, he would have ſomwhat from my ſelf. My hart knoweth not that I gav any name vnfit: yet am I not hereby iuſtified: for in many things wee fayl all: and who am I, that I may not myſſe in ſuch things? neyther hath any of my hearers reproved me for miſnaming the ſtones; nor this my inquiſitive adverſarie himſelf yet convinced me of any one. And now to put him out of doubt, that he ſhall not need hereafter to fiſh any more from others, I will ſhew him whoſe tranſlation I followed, namely the Apoſtle Iohns, Rev. 21. of whom I was perſwaded in generall, before I knew the particulars that he tranſlated all the ſtones from Aarons breſt to the heavenly Ieruſalem. That I followed him, they that heard me comparing Moſes & him together, can yet remember & witneſſe. That I might moſt ſafely follow him, none of grace will deny; yea mine adverſarie himſelf approveth it, & ſo condemneth his own malicious hart & ſlanderous pen.
                  4. One particular name he chargeth me with, as that I had the Onyx, never vſed of God. Anſw. This alſo is vntrue. I gave not the name of Onyx vnto 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Shoham for theſe reaſons. 1. becauſe no Onyx is mentioned

in Rev. 21. wher 12. ſtones are reckned. 2. Becauſe I found the Greek of the Lxx. on Exod. 28.20. to tranſlate 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      or

                      the Beryll for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Shoham. 3. Becauſe I ſaw the Chaldie paraphraſe to have alſo 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     burla, the Beryll. 4. Becauſe in the laſt edition of Pagnine Theſaurus, I found for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Shoham, the Arabick to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Al belór, which ſeemeth by tranſpoſing of letters to be the beryll. Wherfore I taught it to be moſt probable that the Onyx in our Engliſh Exod. 28. was the Beryll, in Rev. 21.
                  Theſe charges I found in his papers, and do now openly deny them; let him prove the contrarie againſt me if he can; or els be aſhamed ſo to traduce me without cauſe. His other things about the ſtones names & applications are but preſumptions & ſurmiſes of his own head, thinking that I did not or could not open them aright. How I applied them he cannot tell, neyther ſhall he be told for me, vntill I ſee in him more Chriſtian affection: though I care not if he knew every particular. When he hath quitted himſelf of theſe vntruthes, or repented them; let him proceed to other matters, ſo as he will directly affirme & bring due proof of his words. The like I anſwer for his other inſinuations of the Badgers ſkin, Candleſtick &c. They are but wiles, wherby he would withdraw me and his reader from the other controverſies of Prayer, Excommunication, & Idoll temples, which himſelf began, but would now ſhift of with theſe new matters. Some things he hath which concerne me no more then any other men, yet coming in his way he ſends them out againſt me, that the ſhew of them may delude the ſimple. He run̄eth into the genealogie Mat. 1. & cauſleſſe blameth me, who never opened that ſcripture in the church. He ſpeaketh of a diſcourſe, that I ſhould run into of Mr Bezaes fame, wheras I never mentioned ſo much as his name in any of my writings, nor wilbe drawen to medle with other mens controverſies which belong not vnto me. Onely this I ſay, Mr Broughton might get himſelf grace better otherwiſe, then by ſeeking to diſgrace other learned men for their infirmities, that the beſt ar ſubject vnto.
                  As for my vnlernedſhip, as he caleth it, be it never ſo great, yet is it no preiudice to the truth, which the moſt
