               We haue sundrie true and vnpartiall witnesses, both within vs, and without vs, against our selues, to proue this truth vnto vs, that we are miserable sinners.
            
               1.Our owne conscience.
               First, the stinging testimonie of our own conscience, which though we many times bleere and blot out, yet doth it sundrie times tell vs, yea almost euery day when wee rise vp, and euery night when we lie downe, wee haue done many things, that wee ought not to haue done, and haue omitted many things, which we ought to haue done.
            
               2.God himself.
               Secondly, God himselfe, who beside that in his infinite knowledge, he is able to charge vs with a thousand transgress

                   vs, because he knoweth all things.
            
            Yea, this eternall God doth by his

iudgements conuince vs to bee sinners, whether they be generall, or particular. By the generall,3.Gods iu

               his wrath being made manifest from heauen, against all vngodlinesse and vnrighteousnesse of all men: and against all the creatures themselues: And by the particular, whilest he manifesteth them either against some Nations, as Israel, Iuda, &c. or some Cities, as Sodom, Gomorrah, Ierusalem, &c. or els priuate persons, as Cain, Ham, Iudas, and such like.

they cannot stand vs in steed: for howsoeuer they be excellent creatures, yet they haue not that of themselues: yea God should finde imperfection in thē, if they were not maintained by his power: and besides as they were not ordeined or created for such a purpose: so they are iustly our enemies for sinne (as whose nature is so pure, that they cannot abide it) and the armed souldiours of the Lord, by his special appointment to our destruction, for our vngodlines.
            If we would looke to dead Saints,2.Dead Saints.
                as in time of superstition and Popery wee were taught, and did, as I feare me, many men yet doe, they cannot fitte vs any whit at all: as well because the dead know nothing at all: as also for that they themselues haue continually confessed of and against themselues, that they haue alwaies stood in need of a Sauiour, and if th

               4.Men regenerate.
               If to them, in whom regeneration is begun, yea and it may be also much aduanced, and who are in the word: indeed called the Saints of God, they accuse themselues of wonderfull euils and manifold imperfections, saying from a free heart, that all their righteousnes are

               5.Goods and riches.
               If we would giue al that we haue vnto the Lord, for a ransome for our own s
                  •
               ns or others: yea if wee would giue our first borne for our transgressions, and the fruits of our bodies for the sinne of our soules, as many idolators haue done heretofore, it will not auaile vs, for it is nothing, nay as a polluted thing in his fight: and besides

it hath no power to purge away sinne, or to purifie conscience.
            If wee would cleaue to outward and feigned holinesse,6.Counterfeite holines.
                as the Pharisees haue done, and the hypocrites of all ages do, wee must make this account of it, that though it bee neuer so glittering and glorious in mās sight (which is not able to discerne of spiritual colors or things) yet it is abbomination before God, to whom and before whom both wee our selues, and all our actions must stand and fall.
            If we stand vpon, the perswasion or practise of superstitious and idolatries deuised by man, we must needs fall:7.VVill worshippings, canno

                     nce vvounded with the feeling of Gods iudgements and sin.
                for besides that they are so many corruptions and defilings of Religion and seruice, that we performe vnto God, which is and ought to bee pure and simple as himselfe, God himselfe also reiecteth them, as things vile and displeasing in his blessed presence.
            Whither shall we then goe? to Christ onely we must needes come:
                  Christ alone must be our refuge.
                and why to him.
            First because, in him dwelleth the fulnes

of all goodnes, yea chefulnes of the godhead bodily: and God hath giuen him to vs, to the end that beleeuing in him wee should not perish, but haue e
                     •
                  erlasting life.
            
            
               
                  VVe haue Gods ovvne testimonie for it.
               How shal we know that? By the Lords own word and voice from heauen, who hath said (and therefore we may, nay we ought to beleeue it) that he is his welbeloued sonne, in whom he is well pleased.
            
            Secondly, because our Sauiour himselfe so graciouslie calleth vs, saying:
                  And Christs owne vvord.
                
               Come vnto me all ye that trauaile, be wearie, and are heauy laden, and I will ease you.
            
            But when we come, we shall find nothing in him. Yes verilie: for through him, apprehended and appropriated to our selues by faith, we shall find eternall peace to Godward, and life and immortalitie brought vnto the beleeuers.
            
               
                  Christs names full of doctrine and comfort.
               In this our Christ, let vs for our comfort & instructiō cōsider, first the names and titles giuen him, which are not bare or idle, or expresse graces, in and for himselfe onely, but are full of fruit and efficacy, and that for vs and our good, specially for spirituall comfort here, and eternall saluation in the life to come.
            
               He is called Iesus,
                  Iesus.
                that is to say Sauiour: because he alone and no other doth and shall saue all his people from their sinnes.
            
            He is called Christ,
                  Christ.
                that is, annointed and sealed by his father, to be our King, Priest and Prophet.
            By his kingdome establishing his double gouernment,1.Christs kingdome.
                one inward in the hearts of his children, by his holy spirit, and the other outward in the Church, by the scepter of his word, and his owne discipline.
            By his Priesthood,2.Christs priesthood.
                
               offering himselfe vp once for all, as a full and sufficient sacrifice, for all the sinnes of his people.
            And his Prophecy,3.Christs Prophecie.

whereby wee must bee saued, but onely the same of Iesus.
            
            Thirdly,
                  Christ alone takes away sin.
                let vs earnestly behold what

            Wisedome,1.Christ is our vvisedome.
                because he is the eternall wisedome of the Father, from before all beginnings: and because comming out of the bosome of the Father, he hath declared vnto vs all the councels of God, concerning our instruction and comfort and that in far greater both plenty and plainnes, specially plainnes, than the Fathers before his comming had.
            Righteousnes,2.Christ is our righteousnes.

vpon his backe and shoulders the course of the law, due to vs for our sins, and ouercōming the same in redeeming vs from it: and secondly because that through his obedience and fulfilling of the law, wee haue iustification imputed vnto vs before God, and i

               3.Christ is our holinesse.
               Sanctification or holines, because it pleased God the Father, in the riches of mercie, to send his owne Sonne, in the similitude of sinfull flesh, and for sinne, cond

                  mned sinne in the flesh, and not onely to impute vnto vs his holines, and to cloath vs with the same, but also through the mightie working of his holie Spirit to frame vs to walke in true holinesse and righteousnes before God and men, all the daies of our lif.
            
            Redemption, because that by offeri

                  g vp himself once vpon the altar of the crosse,
               4.Christ is our redemption.
                he hath redeemed vs from sinne, and set vs free from the diuell, and eternall condemnation, keeping vs so in his hands, that none shall pull vs out of the same,

vntil the full manifestation of our adoption shall appeare, euen the deliuerance of our bodies from all corruption and sinne, at what time hee shall returne our redeemer 
                  •
               rom heauen, and shall change the bodies of our basenes, that they may be made like vnto his glorious bodie.
            
            To conclude,5.Christ is all in all.
                
               it hath pleased the Father, that in him should bee hidden all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, and that in him should all fulnes dwell, yea the verie fulnes of his godhead bodilie, and of all other good things whatsoeuer, that so the Church, which is his bodie, & euery particular sound member thereof might receiue of his abundance, as it is writen: Of his fulnes haue wee all receiued, and grace for grace, that is, grace vpon grace, or as a man would say, graces heaped one vpon another, and that so he should be, the beginning and ending, yea, the very yea and Amen of all Gods Promises.
            
            To know these things, in such sort as before is declared, yea and in more ample manner, than is here set downe, and not to haue the particular feeling of them in a mans owne conscience, is to

little or no purpose at all, vnlesse it bee more and more to afflict the conscience for want of comfortable feeling of them, and to plung vs into a more great and grieuous iudgment, because he that knoweth the will of his Master and doth it not shall be beaten with many stripes.
            
            Wherefore it greatly behooueth vs to striue to attaine the meane, whereby we may lay hold of them: and that meane, yea the only meane is nothing else,

            The one is inward, and the same most powerfull, namely his most

               dge, peace, and all good graces, more effectually to our hearts, than the outward sound doth to the eare.
            
               The other outward, and that is the whole ministerie of truth, whether it be in the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, &c. wee diligently subiecting our selues thereto, carefully receiuing the same, and daily growing in grace thereby, as wee doe in yeeres and strength in the bodie.
            
               
                  Spirit of adoption.
               This Spirit is called the spirit of adoption, because it beareth witnes vnto our spirits, that God hath adopted vs to be his children, and heires of his kingdom, teaching vs also with confidence and boldnes, to crie Abba Father.
            
            
               
                  Spirit, a comforter.
               This Spirit is called the Comforter, because he ministreth vnto the children of God in all their heauinesses and distresses whatsoeuer, either outward or inward, vnspeakable ioyes.
            
               
                  Spirit of truth.
               He is called the Spirit of truth, because he alone doth not only free vs from the errors of the wicked, and the darknesse of our owne hearts, but also inlightneth our vnderstanding, and leadeth vs into all truth.
            
            
               
                  Spirit of sanctification.
               He is called the Spirit of sanctification, because he frameth them, in whom

he dwelleth, to sanctification, and holinesse, and fitteth them indeede to all good workes.
            He maketh vs able to search into,
                  Spirit, together vvith the powers and effects thereof.
                and to vnderstand, the deep things of God, yea such deepe and hidden secrets, as the eye hath not seene, the eare hath not heard, neither haue they entred into mans heart.
            
            He frameth and fashioneth in vs vnfained loue to God, and to his people for his sake, working also in vs a sound minde, in al the duties and seruices that we doe either to God himselfe in heauen, or to men vpon earth.
            This Spirit helpeth our infirmities, teaching yea inabling vs (who know not what to aske or pray as wee should) to send foorth requests vnto God, with sighes and groanes which cannot be expressed.
            
            Also when or wheresoeuer it be bestowed, it bringeth with it a most holie and heauenly libertie, because if the Son by his blessed spirit make vs free, we shall be free indeed.

               Touching the word, I take it in generall to be the ground and foundation of our faith, and that therefore it is rightly called the arme of the Lord, as vpon which onely we must leane.
            
               
                  But most specially the Gospel.
               But most specially I meane that part, which containeth Gods most louing promises, made vnto vs in Iesus Christ, and is rightly called the Gospell.

               And this Gospell is the glad tidings of great ioy, and the mightie power of God vnto saluation, to euery one that beleeueth.
            
            
               2.The message of peace.

               3.The vvord of grace.
               It is called the word of grace, as well because it is freely bestowed vpon vs, as also because it offereth vnto vs the grace of God.
            
               It is the word of truth,4.The vvord of truth.
                because it manifesteth to vs all truth, both of faith and obedience, and setteth out before vs the truth of God, in the acco

               plishing of his promises.
            It is also the word of life,5.The vvord of life.
                not onely because it offereth life euerlasting, for that it doth to al in the Church, but also because that being rightly and reuerently receiued, it sealeth vp the same in our hearts, and frameth vs in this life to a new life, worthie our calling, by the which word also our sauiour Christ hath brought life and immortalitie to light,6.A mysterie or secret.
                which before seemed as it were, to bee hidden: in which respect, it is called in sundry places of the new Testament a mystery or secret, yea such a mystery or secret, as was hidden since the world began.
            
            This word must be, first reuerentlie esteemed,
                  How the vvord must be receiued, and for what cause.
                because if wee prize it not as we should, it will grow into contempt. Then faithfullie credited, because otherwise our estimation and regard of it will do vs no good. Lastly, carefully receiued and profitably practised, because these indeed are true testimonies of our

reuerence and beliefe: yea it must be reuerenced, credited, and receiued, not as the word of a mortall man, but as it is indeed the word of the eternall God.
            
            First, because of him that is the author thereof, which is God onely good, who besides, that hee hath the fulnes of mercie in him, to recompence our labour and loue that way, hath also infinit power, to reuenge the abuse or contempt of it, in what sort soeuer, or in whom soeuer.
            Secondly, because of the matter, or matters rather, that it propoundeth and setteth out vnto vs, which are faith in the promises, obedience to the pre

                specially the Gospel preached, is a most liuely painting out of Christ before our eyes, and as it were a visible crucifying of him in our sights, who died for our sinnes, and rose againe for our righteousnes.

               that wee are the sonnes of God by faith in Christ Iesus, because al that are baptised into Christ haue put on Christ, euen to this end, that so they might become sonnes, yea heires of

God, and fellow heires with our Sauiour himselfe.

               It teacheth vs also, that we should indeuour, to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, hauing the same loue, being of one accord, and of one iudgement, no man seeking his owne, but euery man one anothers wealth, seeing that we are one bodie in Christ and euerie one, one anothers members, as we are all by one sacrament of baptisme, coupled vnto one head which is Christ, and ioyned together too in one

               It representeth vnto vs also thus much, that we being baptised into Christs death, shall by the power thereof die vnto sinne, and that by the vertue of his rising againe, we should walke in newnes of life.

               Lastly that wee shall be raysed vp at the last day out of the dust of the earth, and meete the Lord in the ayre, and dwell with him for euer and euer.
            
               1.The supper pledgeth our eternall life.
               The Lords supper sealeth vnto our consciences, that Christ is that liuing bread which came downe from heauen, of which whosoeuer truely eateth shall liue for euer, because he doth not nourish vs to

death, for that is contrarie to his nature, nor for a time, because he liueth for euer and cannot die (and such are the effects that flowe from him) but vnto euerlasting life.
            Also it setteth out vnto vs,2.Christs death and passion.
                Christs death and passion, with the benefits we reape therby, and namely the remission and forgiuenes of our sinnes, because as he neuer did any thing in vaine, so much lesse died fruitlessely, but that hee might purchase for vs, eternal peace with God, through the worke of our reconciliation with him.
            Further it preacheth vnto vs that Iesus Christ himselfe God and man,3.Our spirituall nourishment in and by him.
                with all his spirituall and heauenly treasures, is fully and wholie giuen vs by the Father, that in him and through him, taken hold of by faith, we may bee fully nourished in the inward and outward man, to the hope of euerlasting life.
            It doth also confirme vnto vs,4.The vnion betvvixt Christ and his church.
                the mystical vnion which is betwixt Christ and his Church, hee dwelling in our hearts by faith, and we thereby made members of his bodie, of his flesh, and of his bones.
            
            
               
               5.The vnitie amongst the members of the Church.
               Lastly, it teacheth vs what vnitie and loue ought to be amongst vs, because that thereby wee that are many, are one bread and one bodie, in as much as wee are all partakers of one bread.
               
                  Examination before the Supper.

                     pentance tovvards God, and sincere loue towards men.
               To the worthy receiuing of this sacrament, there is necessarilie required an earnest examination and true tryall of our selues, which chiefely consisteth, as I take it, in effectuall stedfast faith, and hartie repentance towards God, and vnfained loue towards men.
            
               
                  Faith vvhat it is.
               Faith is a certaine perswasion, and stedfast assurance, which euery true christian man ought to haue, that God the Father loueth him, for Iesus Christ his Sonnes sake, hee by the meanes of that faith, particularly applying vnto himselfe all Gods promises, specially those that concerne forgiuenes of sinnes, and eternall saluation, made vnto vs in the same his sonne Iesus Christ, in whom all his promises, are yea and amen.
            
            
               
                  Repentance what it is.
               Repentance is an earnest hatred of all manner of sinne, inward, outward, past, present or to come, all proceeding from a right and reuerent feare of Gods eternall

Maiestie, which worketh so farre in vs, that it maketh vs to forsake our selues, and to striue to the mortification of our corruption, to the ende wee may wholy giue ouer our selues to bee altogether gouerned by the holy Spirit of God, in the seruice of his Maiestie.
            Loue containeth in it,
                  Loue, and what it comprehendeth.
                not onely a sound affection to our brethren and friends, but also the vnfained reconciliation of our selues vnto those whom wee haue offended, and a readie forgiuing of others the offences they haue cōmitted against vs, euen as willingly, gladly, & freely, as we would the Lord should forgiue vs, for his Christs sake.
            That faith that is outwardly wrought in vs by Gods word,
                  True faith is not fruitlesse.
                and confirmed by the partaking of the holy Sacraments, is not an idle, vaine, or dead faith, but stedfast, vnfained, and working by loue, yeelding foorth the fruites of blessed obedience, not according to the darknesse and corruption of our owne will,1.Naturall corruption.
                lusts, and affections; for they euermore rebell against God. Neither according to mens manners and examples,2.Other mens manners.
                because they

are no sufficient warrants for our conuersation:3.And the fashions of this world, no rules to

                     rame our liues by.

               d right rule of all righteousnesse and well doing.
            This large volume of Gods will, plentifully and plainly reuealed in the Canonicall Scriptures of the old and new Testament, God the Father hath in great mercie for our weaknesse sake, abridged into two tables, containing ten Commandements.
            
               
                  
                     Two tables, ten commaundements.

               Wherein wee are specially to marke these two things: First, that it is the minde of the Law-giuer, in commanding good things, to forbid the contrarie euils: and in forbidding euill things, to commaund the contrarie good, the Almightie therein meeting with mans corruption and the frowardnes of his

heart, who supposeth that if hee doe no euill, though he lead an idle and vnprofitable life from goodnesse, thinketh notwithstanding that hee hath performed his dutie.
            Secondly, that the Lord by his law mindeth to teach vs to bridle and subdue, not onely the act of sinne,1.Act of sinne.
                as the Pharisies imagined;2.Consent to the same.
                nor the consent to the same in our hearts and affections alone, as the Sorbonists, and Popish schoole Diuines dreame a

                this day, but also the least lust and motion that may prick vs thereto,3.Yea, lust or motion must be auoided.
                or rise vp in our minde against the same.
            We must know further that this law of God is obserued and broken,1.Gods law is obserued or broken after tvvo sorts.
                inwardly and outwardly: for the inward breaking or obseruing thereof, because

of themselues, but also to know that they walke in his presence, before whose eyes all things are naked and plaine.
            
            
               
                  Outvvard breach.
               Touching the outward breaking o
                  •
                obseruing thereof wee must know, that the breach of it is then done, when any thing forbidden by that law is committed, or any thing commanded by that law is left vndone: and on the other side that obedience is then yeelded, when any thing commanded by that law is performed, or any thing forbidden by that law,
                  Inward and outward obedience.
                is left vnaccomplished. For good reason is it (whatsoeuer mans witte can cunningly dispute, or say against the same) that these onely should bee allowed and done as good workes, which hee himselfe hath commaunded, and those fled from as euill, which hee himselfe hath forbidden, because hee hath al light and soundnes of true iudgment in himselfe, and is not carried away with partialitie of affection, to pronounce a wrong sentence, a matter very common amongst all men.
            
               
                  Things forbidden by the first commaundement.
               Wherefore no good or godly Christian should allow, vse, or defend any

Idolatrie, Soothsaying, Coniuring, Sorcerie, Witchcraft, Charming, false doctrine, feare, loue, or estimation, of any whatsoeuer creature, aboue God or equally with him, or the persons which shall vse such things.
            None must make, or cause to be made,

                either allow of, vse or defend any Images to expresse or counterfeit God by, or to seeke him or worship him in the same, or any other manner of superstition whatsoeuer, abstaining altogether in his holy seruice, from our own inuentions, blind deuotions, mens doctrines, and other mens examples or rules.
            None ought to vse or abuse the name of God,
                  By the third.
                either in vaine or rash swearing, be the oathes as men account them neuer so small, or in blasphemie, sorcerie or witchcraft, or in cursing, forswearing and such like: yea none should talke or speake or thinke of God, his word, his workes, or whatsoeuer else hee is made knowne vnto vs by, without some vrgent and weightie cause, and that with great reuerence and feare of his Maiestie.
            
               
               
                  By the fourth.
               None should abuse the Lords day, or any other day in doing of their owne wils, or in any wicked and vngodly exercise whatsoeuer, as dauncing, dicing, carding, table-playing, Tauerne or Alehouse haunting, resorting to the beholding of Enterludes, Beare-baitings, and such like.

               None should rebell against, disobey, or speake euill of Magistrates, Ministers, Masters, Mistresses, fathers and mothers, or any other person, whom the Lord in his wisedom and goodnesse hath made their superiours, either by age, authoritie, wealth, office, or any other manner of way whatsoeuer.

               Al hatred, malice and enuie; al braulling, chiding, quarrelling, fighting, bloodshed, murther and such like, yea al manner of desire to do hurt or reuenge, must be auoided.
            
               
                  By the seuenth.
               All whoredome, fornication, adulterie, together with bawdie and filthie talke, loue-songs, tickings and toyings, and all other wanton and light behauiour, and other vnseemely gestures, in bodie or countenance (which indeede

are nothing else, but violent prouocations to filthinesse and euill) yea and all vncleannes both of bodie and minde must be auoided.
            All theft & stealing,
                  By the eighth.
                either openly or secretly, either by force, fraud, or otherwise, together with all deceiuable buying or selling, all vsurie, all extortion, all briberie, all vncharitable getting, and keeping of other mens goods, and to conclude, all manner of false dealings whatsoeuer, by cousenage, weight, measure, &c. ought to be shunned.
            Not only manifest periurie,
                  By the ninth.
                and breaking of lawfull othes and promises, but also all lying, slandring, backbiting, flatterie, and dissembling, together with all euill speaking against others, either in words or writing, proceeding from the malice, corruption, and naughtinesse of mans heart, must be auoided.
            The very pricks and motions to sinne in mans minde (which the holy Scripture sometimes calleth the lusts and concupiscences of our cursed nature) must so farre foorth,
                  By the tenth.
                as God shall inable vs, bee subdued, and that in their first assault,

least otherwise temptation further preuailing vpon vs with delight, we be carried on forward by the subtiltie of sinne, both to consent vnto the euill, and to striue for the attempting and accomplishment thereof.
            
               
                  Vnlavvfull vvishes.
               And here, because vnlawfull wishes be dependents of this sinne of lust and coueting, men must learne to bridle and master the same, and not to haue them so often and common in their mouthes, as, I would I had this, I would I had that, &c.
            On the other side, because the life of a true Christian is not an idle life, and wee are commaunded by Gods holie word not onely to flie from euill,
               
                  Things commaunded by the first precept.
                but to do that which is good, euery godly faithfull man must earnestly striue, according to the power that the Lord hath giuen him, to render vnto him his due honour and seruice, that is, to obey him in all things, and aboue all, to worship him onely, to put their whole trust in him onely, in all feare and dangers to flie vnto him, and to call vpon him onely, acknowledging him to bee the Creator,

preseruer, and gouernour of all things, in heauen and earth.
            To giue vnto him that manner of worship and seruice onely,

                  By the third.
                and of no creature whatsoeuer) when there is iust occasion, as to affirme or maintaine a trueth (specially if the Magistrate require or commaund it,
                  Three ends of an oath.

            To spend the Sabbath,
                  By the fourth.
                as in ceasing from the honest labours of their lawfull callings, so in frequenting of godly exercises, in ioyning themselues to publike assemblies, reuerently and quietly there to behaue themselues in diligent hearing of the word read and preached, in prayer and singing of Psalmes, and as occasion shall serue, and is offered, in

communicating in the holy Sacramēts, and afterward to bestow the rest of the time in priuate reading of Gods word and meditating therein, and in the earnest consideration of his most noble and wonderfull workes.
            
               
                  By the fifth.
               And because all authoritie, either of Magistrates, officers, Ministers, Masters, Mistresses, Fathers, Mothers, and others, is of God, and that there is a like consideration of them al in that respect, euerie one must vse humble obedience towards them, bearing a reuerent minde to them, being readie to relieue, assist, and aide them, and willing to doe after their commandements, in all things in the Lord, and for the Lord, according to their dutie.

               Vnfained loue, patience, humilitie, humanitie, keeping & making of peace, sauing and helping all such as bee in danger, gentle words, soft answeres, and all duties of compassion, must continually be exercised.
            
               
                  By the seuenth.
               And because they are the temples of the holy Ghost, all purenes and chastitie, not onely as touching the act, but also

in heart, word and behauiour, must bee profes

            There must be put in vre all true and faithfull dealing,

                due paiment of debts, diligent seruice, together with all carefull and friendly sauing and deliuering of other mens goods.
            All must witnesse, iudge, and speake the truth,
                  By the ninth.
                yea the whole truth, and nothing els but the truth (as occasion shall be offered) without any respect touching all men, and matters whatsoeuer.
            Lastly,
                  By the tenth.
                when the Lord putteth good motions into their minds, men must diligently take heede, that they doe not suffer them to die in them, or to bee quenched, through the corruption and naughtinesse of their owne hearts, but must carefully striue by al holy meanes, and the diligent and often vse of the same, with earnestnes to pursue them, and to bring them to good effect.
            But we cannot performe these holie duties. That is true indeede,
                  Our vvant of abilitie is supplied by earnest prayer to God.
                for we are not sufficient of our selues, as of our selues to thinke a good thought, much lesse to doe any good deede, but all our sufficiencie is

from God, to whom alone we must haue recourse by earnest supplications and heartie prayers, that by him we may be made able not onely to know, what that good, holy, and acceptable will of his is: but also be strengthened from him (from whom alone commeth euery good and perfect gift) to accomplish and performe the same.
            
               
                  Spurs to prayer specially foure.
               And because wee are very dull and sluggish to performe this, as all other holie duties,1.Gods commandement.

as doth briefly comprehend in it, al such points and matters as be meet and lawfull for vs to demaund: therefore wee should continually labour, rightly to vnderstand it, and carefully to put it in practise, all the daies of our liues.
            But before wee enter into this,

               3.That God onely must be called vpon.
               Besides, wee must know and beleeue that wee must pray vnto this alsufficient God onely, as well because hee alone knoweth the things wee stand in neede of, as also because he alone can help vs, and yeeld reliefe and supplie, when and as best pleaseth himselfe.

                  , and to appoint him to be the onely Mediatour betweene God and vs.

               Also that wee must aske good things

onely: for it is vnreasonable, yea irreligious, to make the most good and holie God, a slaue to satisfie our corrupt affections, now wee haue said before, that nothing is good, but that hee alloweth and liketh of, by his will reuealed in his word.
            And we must aske these good things to good and holy vses onely,6.And that to good ends only.
                as the aduancement of his glorie, the helpe and comfort of our brethren, and our owne good, and not to consume them on our lusts; as wantonnes, gluttonie, drunkennes, enuie, abominable idolatrie, and such like.
            And lastly,7.Mouth and heart must be ioyned together.
                that we must not pray only with our mouth and lips, after the manner of hypocrites, but must yeeld consent to the same in our vnderstandings, hauing indeede the summe of euery petition in our hearts, as we readily haue the words thereof in our mouthes, otherwise all that we do in this behalfe, will be but lip-labour, yea lost labour.
            For outward behauiour in our prayers,
                  Outvvard behauiour in prayer must plainely preach reuerence of Gods maiestie.
                it is seemely and meete that wee should order our selues reuerently and

religiously, in humble kneeling vpon our knees, in stedfast holding vp of our hands, and earnest lifting vp of our eyes to heauen ward, and in disposing euery part and member both of our bodies and of our mindes, in such sort that wee our selues may feele, and others that be present with vs, may sensibly perceiue that wee reuerence his Maiestie, before whom we appeare, and rightly vse that exercise that hee hath enioyned vs, as a special peece of his seruice, euen for our owne health and welfare, as well

the proud) and reiect our prayers.
            Now let vs come to a short opening of that prayer, which the Lord himselfe hath taught vs. The preface or beginning thereof is this.
                  The preface to the Lords prayer expounded.
                
               O our Father which art in heauen.
            
            Out of which words wee may learne many things,1.Earnest in prayer.
                as first in this word O, the earnest affection that ought to bee in them that pray, who must bring with them mindes, not onely farre remoued from earthly and carnall things, but so sted

                no man praying for himselfe onely, but praying as carefullie for others as for themselues.
            Thirdly, in this word, Father, his fatherly prouidence and assured fauour and good will,3.Gods prouidence, and our obedience.
                towards his children in Christ, on the one side, and their sincere loue and hearty obedience towards him

on the other side, according to that of the Prophet: If I be your Lord, where is my honour, and if I be your father, where is my loue?
            
            
               4.Gods povver.
               Fourthly, in these words, which art in heauen, the exceeding Maiestie, power and glorie of God, aboue all things: which if wee respect not in prayer, and feele in our selues to appertaine to vs, the fruites of our lips will fall downe, as water spilt on the earth.
            
               
                  The first petition, vvhat we pray for.
               The first petition is: Hallowed be thy name: wherein wee pray for the knowledge and reuerence of God, so to be in our hearts, that all our thoughts, words and deedes, may in all godlinesse onely so shine before men, that God our heauenly Father may thereby be glorified.
            
               
                  VVhat vve pray against.
               And on the other side, wee pray against ignorance and contempt of God, and of all these meanes whereby hee hath made himselfe knowne vnto vs, as his word, workes, &c. Also wee pray against all loose life and vngodly behauiour whatsoeuer.
            
               
                  The second petition, vvhat vve pray for.
               The second petition is: Thy kingdom come: wherein we pray for the effectuall

feeling and working of Gods blessed spirit, and all his gifts in vs, as righteousnes, peace, comfort, &c: also for the sincere preaching, reuerent hearing, and right receiuing of Gods holy word and discipline. We pray for Magistrates and Common-wealths, and for the Church of Christ wheresoeuer dispersed, and we pray for the glorious appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ, either particularly to visite euery one of vs, or generally to iudge the quicke and the dead, with wonderfull glorie and maiestie, in that great and last day.
            On the other side we pray against all the illusions,
                  VVhat vve pray against.
                suggestions and assaults, either of Sathan, or of our owne corruption; wee pray against the bondage of sinne, the kingdome of Antichrist, and the contempt and forgetfulnes of Gods either particular, or general iudgement.
