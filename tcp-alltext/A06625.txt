            The Prologue at the Black fryers.
            
               WHere the Bee can suck no honney, she leaueth
her stinge behinde, and where the
Beare cannot finde Origanum to heale his
griefe, he blasteth all other leaues with his
breath. Wee feare it is like to fare so with
vs, that seeing you cannot draw from our
labours sweete content, you leaue behinde you a sowre
mislike, and with open reproach blame our good meaninges:
because you cannot reap your wonted mirthes.
Our intēt was at this time to moue inward delight, not
outward lightnesse, and to breede, (if it might bee) soft
smiling, not loude laughing: knowing it to the wise to
be as great pleasure to heare counsell mixed with witte,
as to the foolish to haue sporte mingled with rudenesse.
They were banished the Theater at Athens, and from
Rome hyssed, that brought parasites on the stage with
apish actions, or fooles with vnciuill habites, or Curtisans
with immodest words. We haue endeuoured to be
as farre from vnseemely speaches, to make your eares
glowe, as wee hope you will bee from vnkinde reportes
to make our cheekes blush. The Griffyon neuer spreadeth
her wings in the sunne, when she hath any sick feathers:
yet haue we ventured to present out exercise beefore
your indgements, when we know them full of weak
matter, yeelding rather our selues to the curtesie, which
we haue euer sound, then to the precisenesse, which wee
ought to feare.
         
         
            
            The Prologue at the Court.
            
               THe Arabyās being stuffed with perfumes,
burn Hemblock, a ranck poison: & in Hybla
being cloid with hōney, they account
it daintie to feede on waxe. Your Highnesse
eies, whom varietie hath filled with
fayre showes, and whose eares pleasure
hath possessed with rare soundes, will (we trust) at this
time resemble the princely Eagle, who fearing to surfeit
on spices, stoupeth to bite on wormwood. We present
no conceites nor warres, but deceites and loues,
wherein the trueth may excuse the plainenesse. The necessitie,
the length: the poetrie, the bitternesse. There is
no needelesse point so smal, which hath not his cōpasse:
nor haire so slender, which hath not his shadowe: nor
sporte so simple, which hath not his shadowe: nor
sporte so simple, which hath not showe. Whatsoeuer
we presēt, whether it be tedious (which we feare) or toyishe
(which we doubt) sweete or sowre, absolute or imperfect,
or whatsoeuer, in al humblenesse we all, & I on
knee for all, entreate, that your Highnesse imagine your
self to be in a deepe dreame, that staying the conclusiō,
in your rising your Maiestie vouchfafe but to saye, And
so you awakte.
            
         
      
      
         
            
               
               Actus primus. Schaena prima.
               Phao, Venus, Cupid.
               
                  Phao.
                  
                     THou art a Ferriman, Phao, yet a
free man, possessing for riches
content, and for honors quiet.
Thy thoughts are no higher thē
thy fortunes, nor thy desires
greater then thy calling. Who
climeth, standeth on glasse, and falleth on thorne. Thy
hearts thirste is satisfied with thy hands thrift, and thy
gentle labours in the day, turne to sweete slumbers in
the night. As much doth it delight thee to rule thine
oare in a calme streame, as it dooth Sapho to swaye the
Scepter in her braue court. Enuie neuer casteth her eie
lowe, ambition pointeth alwaies vpwarde, and reuenge
barketh onely at starres. Thou farest dilicately, if thou
haue a fare to buy any thing. Thine angle is ready, when
thine oar is idle, and as sweet is the fish which thou gettest
in the ryuer, as the fowle which other buye in the
market. Thou needst not feare poyson in thy glasse, nor
treason in thy garde. The winde is thy greatest enemy,
whose might is withstoode with pollicy. O sweete life
seldom found vnder a goldē couert, oftē vnder a thached
cotage. But here commeth one, I will withdrawe my
selfe aside, it may be a passenger.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  It is no lesse vnseemely then vnwholsom for
Venus, who is most honoured in Princes courtes, to soiourne
with Vulcan in a smithes forge, where bellowes
blow in steede of sighes, dark smokes rise for sweet perfumes,
& for the panting of louing hearts, is only heard
the beating of steeled hāmers. Vnhappy Venus, yt cariing
fire in thine own breast, thou shouldest dwel with fire in

his forge. What doth Vulcan all day but endeuour to be
as crabbed in maners, as he is crooked in body? driuing
nailes, when he should giue kisses, and hammering hard
armours, when he should sing sweete Amors. It came by
lot, not loue, that I was lincked with him. He giues thee
bolts, Cupid, in steed of arrowes, fearing belike (iealous
foole that he is) that if he shuld giue thee an arrow head
he should make himself a broad head. But come, we wil
to Syracusa, where thy deitie shal be shown, and my disdaine.
I will yoke the necke, that yet neuer bowed, at
which, if Ioue repine, Ioue shal repent. Sapho shal know,
be she neuer so faire, that there is a Venus, which can cō
                     quer,
were she neuer so fortunate.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  If Ioue espie Sapho, he wil deuise some new
shape to entertaine her.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Strike thou Sapho, let Ioue deuise what shape
he can.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Mother, they say she hath her thoughtes in a
string, that she conquers affections, and sendeth loue vp
and downe vpon arrandes, I am afraid she wil yerke me,
if I hit her.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Peeuish boy, can mortal creatures resist that,
which the immortall Gods cannotredresse?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  The Gods are amorous and therefore willing
to be pearsed.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  And she amiable, & therefore must be pearsed.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I dare not.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Draw thine arrow to the head, els I wil make
thee repent it at the heart. Come away and behold the
ferry boy ready to conduct vs. Prety youth, de you keep
the ferry that bendeth to Syracusa?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  The ferrie, faire Lady, that bendeth to Syracusa.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  I feare if the water should begin to swel thou
wilt want cunning to guide.
               
               
                  
                  Phao.
                  These waters are commonly as the passengers
be, and therefore carying one so faire in shew, there is
no cause to feare a rough sea.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  To passe the time in thy boate, canst thou deuise
any pastime?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  If the winde be with me, I can angle, or tell
tales: if against me, it will be pleasure for you to see mee
take paines.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  I like not fishing: yet was I borne of the sea.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  But he may blesse fishing, that caught such an
one in the sea.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  It was not with an angle, my boy, but with a
nette.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  So was it said, that vulcan caught Mars with
Venus.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Didst thou heare so? It was some tale.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Yea Madame and that in the boate I didde
meane to make my tale.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  It is not for a ferry man to talk of the Gods
loues: but to tell how thy father could dig, and thy mother
spinne. But come, let vs away.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  I am ready to waite.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus primus, Schaena sccunda.
               Trachinus, Pandion, Cryticus, Molus.
               
                  Trachi.
                  Pandion, since your comming from the vniuersitie
to the court, from Athens to Syracusa, how doe
you feele your self altered either in humor or opinion?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Altered Trachinus, I say no more, and shame
that any should know so much.
               
               
                  Trachi.
                  Here you see as great vertue, far greater braue
ry, the action of that which you cōtemplate▪ Sapho, faire
by nature, by birth royall, learned by education by gouernment
politike, rich by peace: insomuch as it is hard
to iudge, whether she be more beautifull or wise, vertuous

or fortunate. Beesides, doe you not looke on faire
Ladies in steede of good letters, and behold faire faces
in steed of fine phrases: In vniuersities vertues and vices
are but shadowed in colours white and blacke, in
courtes shewed to life good and bad. There, times paste
are read of in old bookes, times present set downe by
new deuises, times to come coniectured at by aime, by
prophesie, or chaunce here, are times in perfection, nor
by deuise, as fables, but in execution, as trueths. Beleeue
me Pandion, in Athens you haue but tombs, we in court
the bodies, you the pictures of Venus & the wise Goddesses,
we the persons & the vertues. What hath a seh oller
found out by study, that a courtier hath not found
out by practise. Simple are you that think to see more at
the candle snuffe, then the sunne beams, to saile further
in a litle brooke, then in the maine Ocean, to make a
greater haruest by gleaning, then reaping. How say you
Pandion, is not all this true?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Trachinus, what would you more, all true.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Cease then to lead thy life in a study, pinned
with a fewe boardes, and endeuour to be a courtier to
liue in emboste rouffes.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  A labour intollerable for Pandion.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Why?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Because it is harder to shape a life to dissemble,
then to goe forward with the libertie of trueth.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Why do you thinke in court any vse to dissemble?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Doe you knowe in court any that meane to
liue?
               
               
                  Trach.
                  You haue no reasō for it, but an old reporte.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Reporte hath not alwaies a blister on her
tongue.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  I, but this is the court of Sapho natures miracle,
which resembleth the tree Salurus, whose roote is
fastened vpon knotted steele, & in whose top bud leaues
of pure gold.
               
               
                  
                  Pandi.
                  Yet hath Salurus blasts, and water boughes,
wormes and Caterpillers.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  The vertue of the tree is not the cause: but the
Easterly wind, which is thought commonly to bring
cankers and rottenesse.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Nor the excellencie of Sapho the occasion: but
the iniquitie of flatterers, who alwaies whisper in Princes
eares suspition and sowrenesse.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Why, then you conclude with me, that Sapho
for vertue hath no copartner.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Yea, & with the iudgement of the world, that
she is without comparison.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  We wil thither streight.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  I would I might returne streight.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Why, there you may liue stil.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  But not still.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Howe like you the Ladies, are they not passing
faire?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Mine eie drinketh neither the colour of wine
nor women.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Yet am I sure that in iudgemente you are not
so seuere, but that you can be content to allowe of
bewtie by day or by night.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  When I behold bewty before the sunne, his
beams dimme bewtie: when by candle, bewty obscures
toarch light: so as no time I can iudge, because at anie
time I cannot discerne being in the sunne a brightnesse
to shadow bewtie, and in bewtie a glistering to extinguish
light.
               
               
                  Trachi.
                  Schollerlike said, you flatter that, whiche you
seeme to mislike, and to disgrace that, which you moste
wonder at. But let vs away.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  I follow. And you sir boy goe to Syracusa
about by land, where you shall meete my stuffe, pay for
the cariage, and conuey it to my lodging.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  I think all your stuffe are bundles of paper:

but now must you learne to turne your library to a war
drope, & see whether your rapier hang better by your
side, then the penne did in your eare.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus primus, Schaena tertia.
               Cryticus, Molus.
               
                  Criti.
                  Molus, what oddes betweene thy commons in
Athens, and the diet in court? A pages life, & a scollers?
               
               
                  Molus
                  This difference: there of a litle I had somewhat,
here of a great deale nothing, there did I weare Pantopheles
on my legs, here doe I beare them in my handes.
               
               
                  Cryti.
                  Thou maist be skilled in thy Logick, but not in
thy Lerypoope: belike no meate can downe with you,
vnlesse you haue a knife to cutte it: but come among vs,
and you shall see vs once in a morning haue a mouse at a
bay.
               
               
                  Molus.
                  A mouse? vnproperly spoken.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Aptly vnderstoode, a mouse of beafe.
               
               
                  Molus
                  I thinke indeed a peece of beafe as bigge as a
mouse, serues a great companie of such cattes. But what

                  You courtiers be mad fellowes, wee silly soules
are onely plodders at Ergo, whose wittes are claspt vppe
with our bookes, & so full of learning are we at home,
that wescarce know good manners when wee come abroad,
Cunning in nothing but in making small things
great by figures, pulling on with the sweate of our studies
a great shooe vpon a litle foote, burning out one
cādle in seeking for an other, raw wordlings in matters
of substaunce passing wranglers about shadowes.

                  Then is it time lost to be a scholler. We pages are
Politians: for looke what we heare our maisters talke of,
ve determine of: where we suspect, we vndermine: and

where we mislike for some perticular grudge, there we
pick quarrels for a generall griefe. Nothing amonge vs
but in steede of good morow, what newes: wee fal from
cogging at dice to cogge with states: & so forward are
meane mē in those matters, that they wold be cocks to
tread down others, before they be chickēs to rise themselues.
Youthes are very forwarde to stroke their chins,
though they haue no beardes, and to lie as lowd as hee
that hath liued longest.

                  Is it not straung that Phao on the sodain shuld
be so faire?
               
               
                  Lamia.
                  It cannot be straunge, sith Venus was disposed
to make him faire. That cunning had beene better bestowed
on women, which would haue deserued thankes
of nature.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Haplye she did in spite of women, or scorne
of nature.

                  Proude else, how squeamish he is be come alreadie,
vsing both disdaineful lookes, & imperious words:
insomuch that he galleth with ingratitude. And then
Ladies you know how it cutteth a woman to become a

                  Tush, children and fooles, the fairer they are,
the sooner they yeeld, an apple will catch the one, a baby
the other.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Your loouer I thinke be a faire foole: for you loue
nothing but fruit and puppets.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  I laugh at that you all call loue, and iudge it
onely a worde called loue. Me thinks lyking, a curtesie, a
smile, a beck, and such like, are the very Quintessence of
loue.
               
               
                  Fauilla
                  I, Mileta, but were you as wise, as you would
be thought faire, or as faire, as you think your self wise,
you would bee as ready to please men, as you are coye
to pranke your selfe, & as carefull to bee accounted amorous,
as you are willing to be thought discrete.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  No, no, men are good soules (poore soules:)
who neuer enquire but with their eies, louing to father
the cradle, though they but mother the childe. Giue me
their giftes, not their vertues, a graine of their golde
weigheth downe a pound of their witt, a dram of giue
me, is heauier then an ounce of heare me. Beleeue mee
Ladies, giue is a pretie thing.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  I cannot but oftentimes smile to my selfe, to
heare men call vs weake vesselles, when they proue thē
                     selues
broken hearted, vs fraile, when their thoughtes
cannot hang togeather, studying with words to flatter,
and with bribes to allure, when we commōly wish their
tongues in their purses, they speake so simply, and their
offers in their bellies, they doe it so peeuishly.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  It is good sporte to see them want matter:
for then fall they to good manners, hauing nothing in
their mouthes but sweet mistresse, wearing our hands
out with courtly kissings, when their wits faile in courtly
discourses. Now rufling their haires, now setting their
ruffes, then gazing with their eies, then sighing with a
priuie wring by the hand, thinking vs like to be wowed
by signes and ceremonies.
               
               
                  
                  Euge.
                  Yet we, when we sweare with our mouthes wee
are not in loue, then we sigh from the heart and pine in
loue.
               
               
                  Cano.
                  Wee are madde wenches, if men marke our
wordes: for whē I say, I would none cared for loue more
then I, what meane I, but I woulde none loued but I,
where we cry away, doe we not presently say, go too: &
when men striue for kisses, we exclaime, let vs alone, as
though we would fall to that our selues.
               
               
                  Fauilla
                  Nay, then Canope, it is time to goe, and beehold

                  Wisely.

               Actus secundus, Schaena prima,
               Phao, Sybilla.
               
                  Phao.
                  Phao, thy meane fortune causeth thee to vse
an oare, and thy sodaine bewtie a glasse: by the one is
seene thy need, in the other thy pride. O Venus, in thinking
thou hast blest me, thou hast curst me, adding to a
poore estate, a proud heart: and to a disdained man, a
disdaining minde. Thou doest not flatter thy selfe Phao,
thou art faire: faire? I feare me faire, be a word too foule
for a face so passing fayte. But what auaileth bewtie,
hadst thou all things thou wouldest wish, thou mightst
die to morrow, and didst thou want al things thou desirest,
thou shalt liue till thou diest. Tushe Phao, there is
growne more pride in thy minde, then fauour in thy
face. Blush foolish boy, to think on thine own thoughts:
cease complaints, & craue counsell. And loe, behold Sybilla
in the mouth of her caue, I will salute her. Ladye, I
feare me I am out of my way, and so benighted withall
that I am compelled to aske your direction.
               
               
                  
                  Syb.
                  Faire youth, if you will be aduised by mee, you
shal for this time seeke none other Inne, then my caue:
for that it is no lesse perillous to trauaile by night, then
vncomfortable.
               
               
                  Phao
                  Your curtesie offered hath preuented what my
necessity was to entreate.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Come neere, take a stoole, and sit downe. Now,
for that these winter nights are long, and that children
delight in nothing more then to heare old wiues tales,
we will beguile the time with some storie. And though
you behold wrinkles and furrowes in my tawny face:
yet may you happily finde wisdome and counsell in my
white haires.
               
               
                  Phao
                  Lady nothing can content me better thē a tale,
neither is there any thing more necessary for mee then
counsell.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Were you borne so faire by nature?
               
               
                  Phao
                  No, made so faire by Venus.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  For what cause?
               
               
                  Phao
                  I feare me for some curse.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Why, doe you loue, and cannot obteine?
               
               
                  Phao
                  No I may obteine but cannot loue.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Take heede of that my childe.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I cannot chuse good Madame.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Then hearken to my tale, which I hope shall be
as a streight thread to leade you out of those crooked
conceites, and place you in the plaine path of loue.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I attend.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  When I was young, as you nowe are, I speake it
without boasting, I was as bewtifull: for Phoebus in his
Godhead sought to gette my mayden head: but I, fonde
wench, receiuing a benefit from aboue, began to waxe
sqemishe beneath, not vnlike to Asolis, which beeing
made greene by heauenly droppes, shrinketh into the
grounde when there fall showers: or the Syrian mudde,
which being made white chalk by the sunne, neuer ceaseth
rolling, til it lie in the shadow. He to sweete praiers

added great promises, I either desirous to make trial of
his power, or willing to prolong mine owne life, caught
vp my handful of sand, consenting to his suite, if I might
liue as many yeares as there were graines. Phoebus, (for
what cannot Gods doe, and what for loue will they not
do,) graunted my petition. And then I sighe and blushe
to tell the rest, I recalled my promise.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Was not the God angry to see you vnkinde?
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Angry my boy, which was the cause that I was
vnfortunate.
               
               
                  Phao
                  What reuenge for such rigor vsed the Gods?
               
               
                  Syb.
                  None, but suffring vs to liue, and know wee are
no Gods.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  I pray tell on.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  I will Hauing receiued long life by Phoebus, &
rare bewtie by nature, I thought all the yeere woulde
haue beene May, that fresh colours would alwaies continue,
yt time & fortune could not weare out, what Gods
and nature had wrought vppe: not once imagining that
white and read should returne to black and yellow, the
Iuniper, the longer it grew, the crookedder it waxed, or
that in a face without blemish, there should come wrinkles
without number. I did as you do, go with my glasse,
rauished with the pride of mine own bewtie, & you shall
do as I doe, loath to see a glasse disdaining deformitie.
There was none that heard of my fault, but shunned my
fauour, insomuch as I stooped for age before I tasted of
youth, sure to be long liued, vncerteine to bee beloued.
Gentlemen that vsde to sigh from their heartes for my
sweete loue, began to point with their fingers at my withered
face, & laughed to see the eies, out of which fire
seemed to sparkle, to be suckered being old with spectacles.
This causeth me to withdraw my selfe to a solitary
caue, where I must leade sixe hundred yeeres in no lesse
pensiuenesse of crabbed age, then grief of remembred
youth. Only this comfort, that being ceased to be faire,
I study to be wise, wishing to be thought a graue matrō,
since I cannot returne to be a young maide.
               
               
                  
                  Phao
                  Is it not possible to die before you become so
old?
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  No more possible then to returne as you are,
to be so young.
               
               
                  Phao
                  Could not you settle your fancie vpon any, or
would not destinie suffer it?
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  Women willinglye ascribe that to fortune,
which wittingly was committed by frowardnesse.
               
               
                  Phao
                  What will you haue me doe?
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  Take heede you do not as I did. Make not too
much of fading bewty, which is fair in the cradle, & foul
in the graue, resembling Polyon, whose leaues are white
in the morning, and blew before night, or Anyta, which
being a sweet flower at the rising of the sunne, becommeth
a weede, if it be not pluckt before the setting Fair
faces haue no fruites, if they haue no witnesses. When
you shall behold ouer this tender flesh a tough skinne,
your eies which were wont to glaunce on others faces
to be suncke so hollow, that you can scarce looke out of
your own head, and when all your teech shall wagge as
faste as your tongue, thē wil you repent the time which
you cannot recall, and be enforced to beare what moste
you blame. Loose not the pleasaunt time of your youth,
then the which there is nothing swifter, nothing sweeter.
Bewtie is a slippery good, which decreaseth whilest
it is encreasing, resēbling the Medler, which in the moment
of his full ripenes is known to be in a rottennes.
Whiles you looke in the glasse, it waxeth old with time,
if on the Sunne parcht with heate, if on the winde, blasted
with cold. A great care to keepe it, a short space to
enioy it, a sodain time to loose it. Be not coy, when you
are courted. Fortunes wings are made of times feathers,
which stay not whilest one may measure them. Be
affable and curteous in youth, that you may be honoured
in age. Roses that lose their colours, keepe their sauours,
and pluckt from the stalke, are put to the still. Cotonea,
                     
because it boweth when the sunne riseth, is sweetest,
when it is oldest: and children, which in their tēder
yeeres sow curtesie, shal in their declining states reap pitie.
Be not proud of bewties painting whose colours
cōsume themselues, because they are bewties painting.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I am driuen by your counsell into diuerse conceites,
neither knowing how to stande, or where to fall,
but to yeelde to loue is the only thing I hate.
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  I cōmit you to fortune, who is like to play such
prancks with you, as your tēder yeeres can scarse beare,
nor your greene wits vnderstand. But repaire vnto me
often, and if I cannot remoue the effectes, yet I will manifest
the causes.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I goe, ready to returne for aduice, before I am
resolued to aduenture.
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  Yet hearken two words, thou shalt get friendshippe
by dissembling, loue by hatred, vnlesse thou perish,
thou shalt perish: in digging for a stone, thou shalt
reach a starre: thou shalt be hated most, because thou art
loued most. Thy death shalbe feared & wished: so much
for prophecie, which nothing can preuent: and this for
counsell, which thou maist follow. Keepe not companie
with Antes, that haue winges, nor talke with any, neere
the hill of a mowle, where thou smellest the sweetnesse
of serpents breath, beware thou touch no parte of the
bodie. Be not mery among those that put Buglosse in
their wine, and suger in thine. If any talke of the Eclipse
of the sunne, say thou neuer sawest it. Nourishe no conies
in thy vaultes, nor swallowes in thine eues. Sowe
next thy vine Mandrage, and euer keepe thine eares open,
and thy mouth shut, thine eies vpwarde, and thy
fingers downe: so shalt thou doe better then otherwise,
though neuer so well as I wishe.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Alas Madame, your prophesie threatneth miseries,
and your counsell warneth impossibilities.
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  Farewell, I can answere no more.

                  Phao
                  Vnhappy Phao. But softe, what gallant troupe is
this? What Gentlewoman in this?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Sapho, a Lady heere in Sycily.
                  
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  What faire boy is that?
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Phao, the Ferrie man of Syracusa.
                  
               
               
                  Phao
                  I neuer saw one more braue: be al Ladies of such
maiestie?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  No, this is she that al wonder at and worship.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  I haue seldome seene a sweeter face. Be all Ferrie
men of that fairenesse?
               
               
                  Trach.
                  No Madame, this is he that Venus determined
among men to make the fairest.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Seeing I am onely come forth to take the ayre,
I will crosse the Ferrie, and so the fieldes, then going in
through the park, I thinke the walke wil be pleasant.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  You wil much delight in the flattering greene,
which now beginneth to be in his glory.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Sir boy, will yee vndertake to cary vs ouer the
water? Are you dumb, can you not speake?
               
               
                  Phao
                  Madame, I craue pardon, I am spurblinde, I
could scarse see.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  It is pitie in so good a face there should bee an
euill eie.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I would in my face there were neuer an eie.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Thou canst neuer be rich in a trade of life of all
the basest.
               
               
                  Phao
                  Yet content Madame, which is a kind of life of
all the best.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Wilt thou forsake the ferrie, and followe the
court as a Page?
               
               
                  Phao
                  As it pleaseth fortune Madame, to whome I am
a prentice.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Come, let vs goe?
               
               
                  
                  Trachi.
                  Will you goe Pandion.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Yea.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus secundus, Schaena tertia.
               Molus, Cryticus, Calypho,
               
                  Molus
                  Cryticus comes in good time, I shall not bee alone.
What newes Cryticus?
               
               
                  Cryti.
                  I taught you that lesson, to aske what newes, &
this is the newes: to morow ther shalbe a desperate fray
betweene two, made at all weapons, from the browne
bill to the bodkin.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Now thou talkest of Frayes, I pray thee what is
that, whereof they talke so commonlye in courte, valour,
the stab, the pistoll, for the which euery man that
dareth is so much honoured?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  O Molus, beware of valour, hee that can looke
bigge, and weare his dagger pomel lower thē the point,
that lyeth at a good warde, and can hit a button with a
thrust, and will into the field man to man for a boute or
two, he, Molus, is a shrewd fellow, and shall be well followed.
               
               
                  Molus
                  What is the end?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Daunger or death.
               
               
                  Molus
                  If it be but death that bringeth all this commendation,
I account him as valiant that is killed with
a surfet, as with a sword.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  How so?
               
               
                  Molus
                  If I venture vpon a full stomacke to eat a rasher
on the coales, a carbonado, drinke a carouse, swallow all
things that may procure sicknesse or death, am not I as
valiaunt to die so in a house, as the other in a field? Me
thinkes that Epicures are as desperate as soldiours, and
cookes prouide as good weapons as cutlers?
               
               
                  
                  Criti.
                  O valiaunt kinght.
               
               
                  Molus
                  I will die for it, what greater valor?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Schollers fight, who rather seeke to choak their
stomackes, then see their blood.
               
               
                  Molus
                  I will stand vppon this point: if it bee valour to
dare die, he is valiaunt howsoeuer he dieth.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Well, of this hereafter but here commeth Calipho,
we will haue some sporte.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  My mistresse, I think hath got a Gadfly, neuer
at home, and yet none can tel where abrode. My maister
was a wise man, when he matcht with such a womanne.
When she comes in, we must put out the fire, because of
the smoake, hang vp our hammers because of the noise,
and doe no worke, but watch, what shee wanteth. She is
faire, but by my troath I doubt of her honestie. I muste
seeke her, that I feare Mars hath found.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Whom doest thou seeke?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I haue found those I seeke not.
               
               
                  Molus
                  I hope you haue found those, which are honest.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  It may be: but I seeke no such.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Cryticus, you shall see me by learning to proue
Calipho to bee the deiull.
               
               
                  Cryti.
                  Let vs see but I pray thee proue it better, then
thou didst thy self to be valiant.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Calipho, I will proue thee to bee the diuell.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Then will I sweare thee to bee a God.
               
               
                  Molus
                  The diuell is black.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  What care I.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Thou art black.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  What care you.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Therfore thou art the diuell.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I denie that.
               
               
                  Molus
                  It is the conclusion, thou must not denie it.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  In spite of all conclusions, I will denie it.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Molus, the Smith holdes you hard.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Thou seest he hath no reason.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Trie him againe.
               
               
                  
                  Molus
                  I will reason with thee now from a place.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I meane to aunswere you in no other place.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Like maister, like man.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Yt may be.
               
               
                  Molus
                  But thy maister hath hornes.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  And so maist thou.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Therefore thou hast hornes, and ergo a deuill,
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Be they all diuelles haue hornes?
               
               
                  Molus
                  All men that haue hornes, are.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Then are there moe diuels on earth thē in hell.
               
               
                  Molus
                  But what doest thou answere?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I deny that.
               
               
                  Molus
                  What?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Whatsoeuer it is, that shall proue mee a diuell.
But hearest thou scholler, I am a plaine fellow, and can
fashion nothing but with the hammer. What wilt thou
say, if I proue thee a smith?
               
               
                  Molus
                  Then will I say thou art a scholler.
               
               
                  Cryti.
                  Proue it Calipho, and I will giue thee a good
Colaphum.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I will proue it, or els,
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Or els what?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Or els I will not prooue it. Thou art a Smith:
therefore thou art a smith. The conclusion, you say, must
not bee denyed: & therfore it is true, thou art a smith.
               
               
                  Molus
                  I, but I denie your Antecedent.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  I, but you shal not. Haue I not toucht him Cryticus?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  You haue both done learnedly: for as sure as he
is a smith, thou art a diuell.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  And then he a deuill, because a smith: for that it
was his reasō to make me a deuil being a smith.
               
               
                  Molus
                  There is no reasoning with these Mechanical
doltes, whose wits are in their hands, not in their heads.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Be not cholericke, you are wise: but let vs take
vp this matter with a song.
               
               
                  
                  Caly.
                  I am content, my voice is as good as my reason.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Than shall we haue sweete musick. But come, I
will not breake of.
               
               Song. Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus secundus, Schaena quarta.
               Phao, Sybilla.
               
                  Phao
                  What vnacquainted thoughtes are these Phao,
farre vnfit for thy thoughtes, vnmeet for thy birth, thy
fortune, thy yeares, for Phao: vnhappy, canst thou not
be content to beholde the sunne, but thou muste couet
to build thy nest in the Sunne? Doth Sapho bewitch
thee, whome all the Ladies in Sicily coulde not wooe:
Yea, poore Phao, the greatnesse of thy mind is far aboue
the bewtie of thy face, and the hardnesse of thy fortune
beyonde the bitternesse of thy words. Die Phao, Phao
die: for there is no hope if thou bee wise, nor safetie, if
thou be fortunate. Ah Phao, the more thou seekest to
suppresse those mounting affections, they soare the loftier,
& the more thou wrastlest with them the stronger
they waxe, not vnlike vnto a ball, which the harder it is
throwne against the earth, the higher it boundeth into
the ayre: or our Sycilyan stone, which groweth hardest
by hammeringe. O diuine loue, and therefore diuine,
because loue, whose deitie no conceite canne
compase, and therfore no authoritie canne constraine,
as miraculous in working as mightie, & no more to bee
suppressed then comprehended. Howe now Phao, whether
art thou caried, committing idolatrie with that
God, whome thou hast cause to blaspheme. O Sapho,
faire Sapho; peace miserable wretch, enioy thy care in
couert, we are willow in thy hatte, and baies in thy hart.
Leade a Lamb in thy hand, & a Fox in thy head, a doue
on the back of thy hand, & a sparow in the palme. Gold
boyleth best, whē it bubleth least, water runneth smoothest,
where it is deepest. Let thy loue hang at thy hearts

bottome, not at the tongues brimme. Things vntold,
are vndone, there can be no greater comforte, then to
know much, nor any lesse labour, then to saye nothing.
But ah thy bewty Sapho, thy bewty. Beginnest thou to
blabbe? I blabbe it Phao, as long as thou blabbest her
bewty. Bees that die with honney, are buried with harmonie.
Swannes that end their liues with songs, are couered
when they are dead, with flowers: and they that
till their latter gaspe commend bewty, shall be euer honoured
with benefites. In these extreamities I will goe
to none other Oracle▪ then Sybilla, whose olde yeares
haue not beene idle in these young attemptes, & whose
sound aduice may mitigate (though the heauēs cannot
remoue) my miseries. O Sapho, sweete Sapho, Sapho. Sibilla?
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Who is there?
               
               
                  Phao
                  One not worthy to be one.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Faire Phao?
               
               
                  Phao
                  Vnfortunate Phao.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Come in.
               
               
                  Phao
                  So I wil, and quite thy tale of Phoebus, with one
whose brightnesse darkeneth Phoebus. I loue Sapho, Sybilla,
Sapho, ah Sapho, Sybilla.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  A short tale Phao, and a sorowfull, it asketh pitie
rather then counsell.
               
               
                  Phao
                  So it is Sybilla: yet in those firm yeares me thinketh
there shold harbour such experience, as may deferre,
though not take away, my destinie.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  It is hard to cure that by wordes, which cannot
be eased by hearbes, and yet if thou wilt take aduice, be
attentiue.
               
               
                  Phao
                  I haue brought mine eares of purpose, and will
hāg at your mouth, til you haue finished your discourse.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Loue, faire child, is to be gouerned by arte, as thy
boat by an oare: for fancie, thogh it cōmeth by hazard,
is ruled by wisdome. If my preceptes may perswade,

(and I pray thee let them perswade) I woulde wish thee
first to be diligent: for that womenne desire nothing
more then to haue their seruants officious. Be alwaies in
sight, but neuer slothful. Flatter I meane, lie, litle things
catch light mindes, and fancy is a worme, that feedeth
first vpon fenell. Imagine with thy selfe all are to bee
won, otherwise mine aduise were as vnnecessary as thy
labour. It is vnpossible for the brittle mettall of womē
to withstand the flattering attemptes of men: only this,
let them be asked, their sex requireth no lesse, their modesties
are to be allowed so much. Be prodigall in prayses
and promises, bewtie must haue a trumpet, & pride
a gifte. Peacocks neuer spread their feathers, but when
they are flattered, & Gods are seldome pleased, if they
be not bribed. There is none so foule, that thinketh not
her selfe faire. In commending thou canst loose no labor.
for of euery one thou shalt be beleeued. O simple
women, that are brought rather to beleeue what their
eares heare of flattering men, then what their eies see in
true glasses.
               
               
                  Phao
                  You degresse onely to make me beleeue, that
women do so lightly beleeue.
               
               
                  Sybilla
                  Then to the purpose. Chuse such times to break
thy suite, as thy Lady is pleasant. The wooden horse entred
Troy, when the soldiers were quaffyng, and Penelope
forsooth, whome fables make so coy, among the pottes
wrong her wooers by the fists, when she lowred on their
faces. Grapes are minde glasses. Venus worketh in Bacchus
presse, & bloweth fire vpon his lycour. When thon
talkest with her, let thy speach be pleasant, but not incredible.
Chuse such words as may (as many may) melt
her minde. Honney ranckleth, when it is eaten for pleasure
and faire words wound, when they are hearde for
loue. Write, and persist in writing, they read more then
is written to them, & write lesse then they thinke. In cō
                     ceite
studie to be pleasaunt in attire braue, but not too

curious, when she smileth laugh outright, if rise, stande
vp, if sit, lye downe. Loose al thy time to keepe time with
her. Can you sing, shew your cunning, can you daunce,
vse your legges, can you play vppō any instrument, practise
your fingers to please her fancy, seeke out qualyties.
If she seeme at the first cruell, be not discouraged. I
tell the a straung thing, womenne striue, because they
would be ouercome, force they call it: but such a welcome
force they account it, that continually, they study
to be enforced. To faire words ioyne sweet kisses, which
if they gently receiue, I say no more, they wil gently receiue.
But be not pinned alwaies on her sleeues, straungers
haue greene rushes, whē daily guests are not worth
a rushe. Looke pale, and learne to be leane, that who so
seeth thee, may say, the Gentleman is in loue. Vse no
forcerie to hasten thy successe, wit is a witch, Vlysses was
not faire, but wise, not cunning in charmes, but sweete
in speach, whose filed tōgue made those inamoured that
sought to haue him inchaūted. Be not coy, beare, sooth,
sweare, die to please thy Lady, these are rules for poore
louers, to others I am no mistresse. He hath wit ynough,
that can giue ynough. Dumbe men are eloquent, if they
be liberall. Beleeue me great gifts are little Gods. When
thy mistresse doth bend her brow, do not thou bend thy
fiste. Camokes must be bowed with sleight, not strēgth,
water to be trained with pipes, not stopped with sluses,
fire to be quenched with dust, not with swordes. If thou
haue a ryuall, be pacient, arte muste winde him out not
malice: time, not might, her chaunge, and thy constancie.
Whatsoeuer she weareth: sweare it becomes her. In
thy louce be secrete. Venus cofers, though they bee hollow,
neuer sound, & when they seeme emptiest, they are
fullest. Old foole that I am, to doe thee good, I beginne
to doate, & counsell that, which I woulde haue concealed.
Thus Phao haue I giuen thee certeine regardes, no
rules, only to set thee in the way, not to bring thee hōe.
               
               
                  
                  Phao
                  Ah Sybilla, I pray goe on, that I may glutte my
selfe in this science.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Thou shalt not surfette Phao, whilest I diet thee.
Flyes that die on the honney suckle become poyson to
bees. A little in loue is a great deale.
               
               
                  Phao
                  But all that can be saide not enough.
               
               
                  Syb.
                  White siluer draweth blacke lines, and sweete
wordes will breede sharpe tormentes.
               
               
                  Phao
                  What shall become of mee?
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Goe dare
               
               
                  Phao
                  I goe, Phao, thou canst but die, & then as good
die with great desires, as pine in base fortunes.
                  Exit.
               
            
         
         
            
               Actus tertius, Schaena prima.

                  Trach.
                  Sapho is falne sodenly sick, I cannot guesse the
cause.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Some colde belike, or els a womans qualme.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  A straunge nature of colde, to driue one into
such an heate.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Your Phisick sir I thinke be of the second sort,
els would you not iudge it rare, that whot feuers are ingendred
by cold causes.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Indeede Lady, I haue no more Phisick then wil
purge choller, and that if it please you, I will practise vppon
you. It is good for women that be waspish.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Fayth sir no, you are best purge your owne melancholy:
belike you are a male content.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  It is true, and are not you a female content.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Softe, I am not content, that a male and Female
content, should go together.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Ismena is disposed to be merie.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  No, it is Pandion would faine seeme wise.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  You shall not fall out? for Pigions after byting
fall to billing, and open iarres make the closest iestes.
               
               
                  
                  Euge.
                  Mileta, Ismena, Mileta: Come away, my Lady is
in a sowne.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Aye me.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Come, let vs make haste.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  I am sorie for Sapho: because shee will take no
Phisicke, like you Pandion, who being sick of the sullens,
will seeke no friend.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Of men we learne to speake, of Gods to holde
our peace. Silence shall disgeste what follye hath swallowed,
and wisdome weane what fancie hath noursed.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Is it not loue?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  If it were, what then?
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Nothing, but that I hope it be not.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  Why, in courtes there is nothing more common.
And as to be bald among the Micanyans it was accounted
no shame, because they were all balde: so to be
in loue among courtiers it is no discredit: for that they
are al in loue.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  Why, what doe you think of our Ladies?
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  As of the Seres wooll, which beeing whitest &
softest, fretteth soonestand deepest.
               
               
                  Trach.
                  I will not tempt you in your deepe Melācholy,
least you seeme sowre to those, which are so sweete. But
come, let vs walke a litle into the fieldes, it may bee the
open ayre will disclose your close conceites.
               
               
                  Pandi.
                  I will goe with you: but send our pages away.

                  I am in the depth of my learning driuen to a

woont to fast so ofte in the Vniuersitie.

                  Thy belly is thy God.

                  Why?

                  For venter non habet aures. But thy backe is thy

                  Then is it a blind God.

                  Easie. Nemo videt manticae, quod intergo est.

                  Then woulde the sachell that hanges at your

God, hoc est, my belly.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  Excellent. But how canst thou studie, when thy
minde is onely in the kitchen?

                  Criti.
                  Cheese.
               
               
                  Molus
                  It is against the old verse, Caseus est nequam.
                  
               
               
                  Cryti.
                  Yea, but it disgesteth all things except it selfe.
               
               
                  Molus
                  Yea, but if a man hath nothing els to eate, what
shall it disgest?
               
               
                  Criti.
                  You are disposed to iest. But if your silkē throat
can swallow no packthread, you must pick your teeth,
and play with your trencher.
               
               
                  Molus
                  So shall I not incurre the fulsom & vnmannerly
sinne of surfetting. But here commeth Calipho.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  What newes?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Since my being here, I haue sweat like a dogge,
to proue my maister a deuill, hee brought such reasons
to refel me, as I promise you, I shall like the better of his
witte, as long as I am with him.
               
               
                  
                  Molus
                  How?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Thus, I alwayes arguing that he had hornes, &
therefore a diuell, he saide: foole, they are things lyke
hornes, but no hornes. For once in the Senate of Gods
being holde a solemn sesion, in the midst of their talk
I put in my sentence, which was so indifferent, that they
all concluded it might aswel haue beene lefte out, as put
in, and so placed on each side of my head things lyke
hornes, and called me a Parenthesis, Nowe my maisters,
this may be true, for I haue seene it my selfe aboute diuerse
sentences.
               
               
                  Molus
                  It is true, and the same time did Mars make a
full point, that Vulcans head was made a Parenthesis.
                  
               
               
                  Criti.
                  This shall go with me, I trust in Syracusa to giue
one or other a Parenthesis.

                  Is Venus yet come home?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  No, but were I Vulcan, I would by the Gods,
               
               
                  Criti.
                  What wouldest thou?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Nothing, but as Vulcan halt by the Gods.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  I thought you would haue hardly entreated Venus.
               
               
                  Caly.
                  Nay, Venus is easily entreated: but let that goe
bie.
               
               
                  Criti.
                  What?
               
               
                  Caly.
                  That which maketh so many Parenthesis.
                  
               
               
                  Molus
                  I must goe by too, or els my maister will not go
by mee: but meete me full with his fiste. Therfore, if we
shall sing, giue me my part quickly: for if I tarrie long, I
shall cry my parte wofully.

               Sapho in her bed, Mileta, Ismena, Kanope, Eugenua,
Fauilla, Lamya.
               
                  Sapho.
                  Hey ho: I know not which way to turne me Ah,
ah, I fainte, I die,
               
               
                  
                  Milet.
                  Madame, I thinke it good you haue more clothes,
and sweate it out.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  No, no, the best ease I finde is to sigh it
out.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  A straunge disease, that should breede such a
desire.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  A strang desire that hath brought such a disease.

                  Where, Ladie, doe you feele your most paine?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Where no bodie els can feele it Canope.
               
               
                  Cano.
                  At the heart?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  In the heart.
               
               
                  Cano.
                  Will you haue any Mithrydate?
                  
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Yea, if for this disease there wer any Mithrydate?
                  
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Why? what disease is it Madam, that phisick cā
not cure?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Onely the disease Mileta that I haue.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Is it a burning ague?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  I thinke so, or a burning agonie.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  Will you haue any of this Syrope, to moysture
your mouth?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Would I had some local things to dry my brain.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  Madame will you see if you can sleepe?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Sleepe Fauilla: I shall then dreame.
               
               
                  Lami.
                  As good dreame sleeping, as sigh waking.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  Phao is cunning in all kind of simples, and it is
hard, if there bee none to procure sleepe.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Who?
               
               
                  Euge.
                  Phao.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Yea Phao, Phao, ah Phao, let him come presētly.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Shall we draw the cutteines, whilest you gyue
your selfe to slumber?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Doe, but departe not, I haue such startes in my
sleepe, disquieted I know not how. In a slumber.
Phao, Phao.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  What say you Madame?
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Nothing, but if I sleepe not now, you sende for
Phao. Ah Gods.
               
               
                  
Shee falleth asleepe. The Curtaines drawne.
               
                  Milet.
                  There is a fish called Garus, that healeth al
sick
nesse, so as whilest it is applyed one name not Garus.
                  
               
               
                  Euge.
                  An euill medicine for vs women: for if we shuld
be forbidden to name Garus, we shuld chat nothing but
Garus.
                  
               
               
                  Cano.
                  Well said Eugenua, you know your selfe.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  Yea Canope, and that I am one of your sexe.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  I haue hearde of an hearbe called Lunary, that
being bound to the pulses of the sick, causeth nothinge
but dreames of weddings and daunces.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  I think Ismena, that hearb be at thy pulses now:
for thou art euer talking of matches and merymentes.
               
               
                  Cano.
                  It is an vnlucky figne in the chamber of the sick
to talke of mariages; for my mother saide, it foresheweth
death.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  It is very euill to Canope to sitte at the beddes
feete, and foretelleth daunger: therefore remoue your
stoole, and sitte by me.
               
               
                  Lamy.
                  Sure it is some cold she hath taken.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  If one were burnt, I thinke wee women woulde
say, he died of a cold.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  It may be some conceite.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Then is there no feare: for yet did I neuer heare
of a woman that died of a conceite.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  I mistruste her not: for that the owle hath not
shrikte at the window, or the night Rauen croked, both
being fatall.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  You are all superstitious: for these bee but fancies
of doting age: who by chance obseruing it in some,
haue set it downe as a religion for all.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Fauilla, thou art but a Girle, I would not haue a
Weesel crye, nor desire to see a Glasse, nor an old wife
come into my chamber: for then though I lyngred in
my disease, I should neuer escape it.
               
               
                  
                  Sapho
                  Ah, whoe is there? what sodeine affrightes bee
these? Me thought Phao came with simples to make me
sleep. Did no bodie name Phao beefore I beganne to
slumber?
               
               
                  Milet
                  Yes, we told you of him.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  Let him be heere too morow.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  He shall, will you haue a litle broth to comforte
you?
               
               
                  Sahpo
                  I can relish nothing.

                  Yet a little you must take to sustaine nature.
               
               
                  Sapho
                  I cannot Mileta, I will not. Oh, which way shall
I lye? what shall I doe? Heygh ho. O Mileta, help to reare
me vp, my bed, my head lyes too lowe. You pester mee
with too many clothes. Fie, you keepe the chamber too
hotte, auoide it, it may be I shall steale a nappe when all
are gone.
               
               
                  Mileta
                  Wee will.
               
               
                  Sapho sola.
                  Ah impacient disease of loue, and Goddesse
of loue thrise vnpitifull. The Eagle is neuer stricken with
thunder, nor the Olyue with lightning and maye great
Ladies be plagued with loue? O Venus, haue I not strawed
thine Altars with sweete roses? kepte thy swannes
in cleare rvuers? sead thy sparrowes with ripe corne, &
harboured thy doues in faire houses? Thy Tortoys haue
I nourished vnder my fig tree, my chāber haue I ceeled
with thy Cockleshels, & dipped thy spung into the freshest
waters. Didst thou nourse me in my swadling clouts
with wholsome hearbes, that I might perish in my flowting
yeares by fancie? I perceiue, but to late I perceiue,
and yet not too late, because at last, that straines are
caught aswell by stooping too low, as reaching to high:
that eies are bleared as soone with vapours that come
from the earth, as with beames that procede from the
sunne. Loue lodgeth sometimes in caues: & thou Phoebus,
that in the pride of thy hearre shinest all day in our
Horizon, at night dippest thy head in the Ocean. Resiste

it Sapho, whilest it is yet tender. Of Acornes comes
Oakes, of droppes floudes, of sparkes flames of Atomies
Elementes. But alas it fareth with mee as with waspes,
who feeding on serpents, make their stings more venomous:
for glutting my selfe on the face of Phao, I haue
made my desire more desperate. Into the neast of an
Alcyon no birde can enter but the Alcyon, and into the
hart of so great a Ladie can any creep but a great Lord?
There is an hearbe (not vnlike vnto my loue) whiche the
further it groweth from the sea, the salter it is, and my
desires the more they swarue from reason, the more
seeme they reasonable. When Phao commeth, what thē?
wilt thou open thy loue? Yea. No Sapho: but staring in
his face till thine eies dasell, and thy spirites fainte, die
before his face: then this shall be written on thy Tomb,
that though thy loue were greater then wisdome could
endure; yet thine honour was such, as loue could not violate,
Mileta?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  I come.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  It wil not be, I can take no reste, which way soeuer
I turne.

                  Mileta, if thou wilt, a Martiredom. But giue me
my lute, and I will see if in songe I can beguile
mine owne eies.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Here Madame.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Haue you sent for Phao?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Yea.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  And to bring simples that will procure sleepe?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  No.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Foolish wensh, what should the boy do heere,
if he bring not remedies with him? you thinke belike I
could sleep if I did but see him, Let him not come at al,
yes, let him come: no, it is no matter: yet will I trie, lette
him come: doe you heare?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Yea Madame, it shall be doone Peace, no noise:

shee beginneth to fall asleepe. I will goe to Phao.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Goe speedily: for if she wake, and finde you not
heere, shee will bee angry. Sicke folkes are testie, who
though they eate nothing yet they feede on gall.
               
               The song.
            
            
               Actus tertius, Schaena prima.
               Mileta, Phao, Ismena, Sapho, Venus.
               
                  Milet.
                  I woulde eyther your cunning, Phao, or your
fortune might by simples prouoke my Lady to some
slumber.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  My simples are in operation as my simplicitie
is, which if they do litle good, assuredly they can doe no
harme.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Were I sicke, the verye sight of thy faire face
would driue me into a sound sleepe.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Indeede Gentlewomen are so drowsie in their
desires, that they can scarce hold vp their eies for loue.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  I meane the delight of bewtie would so blinde
my senses, as I shoulde bee quickly rocked into a deepe
rest.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  You women haue an excuse for an aduauntage,
which must be allowed: because onely to you women it
was allotted.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Phao, thou art passing faire, & able to drawe a
chaste eie not only to glaunce: but to gaze on thee. Thy
yong yeares, thy quick wit, thy staied desires are of force
to controll those which should commaund.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Lady, I forgot to commend you first, and leaste I
shoulde haue ouerslipped to praise you at all, you haue
brought in my bewtie, which is simple, that in curtisie I
might remember yours, which is singular.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  You mistake of purpose, or miscōster of malice.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  I am as farre from malice, as you from loue, &
to mistake of purpose, were to mislike of peeuishnes.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  As far as I from loue? Why, think you me so dul
I cannot loue, or so spitefull I will not?
               
               
                  
                  Phao.
                  Neither Lady: but how shoulde men imagine
women can loue, when in their mouths there is nothing
rifer, then in faith I do not loue.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Why, wil you haue womēs loue in their tongs?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Yea,els do I think there is none in their harts.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Why?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Because there was neuer any thing in the bottō
of a womans hart, that commeth not to her tongs end.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  You are too young to cheapen loue.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Yet old ynough to talk with market folkes.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Well, let vs in.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Phao is come.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Who?Phao? Phao, let him come neere: but who
sent for him?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  You Madame.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  I am loath to take any medicins: yet must I rather
thē pine in these maladies. Phao, you may make me
sleepe, if you will?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  If I can, I must, if you will?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  What hearbes haue you brought Phao?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Such as will make you sleepe Madame, though
they cannot make me slumber.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Why, how can you cure me, when you cannot
remedy your selfe?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Yes Madame, the causes are contrary. For it is
onely a drinesse in your braines, that keepeth you from
rest, But,
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  But what?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Nothing, but mine is not so.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Nay, then I despaire of helpe, if our disease bee
not all one.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  I would our diseases were all one.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  It goes hard with the pacient, whē the Phisition
is desperate.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Yet Medea made the euerwaking Dragon to
snorte, when shee poore soule could not winke.
               
               
                  
                  Sapho.
                  
                     Medaea was in loue, & nothing could cause her
rest but Iason.
                  
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Indeede I know no hearb to make louers sleepe
but Heartes ease, which beecause it groweth so high, I
cannot reach: for,
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  For whom?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  For such as loue.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  It groweth very low, and I can neuer stoope to
it that,
               
               
                  Phao.
                  That what?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  That I may gather it: but why doe you sight so
Phao
               
               
                  Phao.
                  It is mine vse Madame.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  It will doe you harme, and mee too: for I neuer
heare one sighe, but I must sight also.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  It were best then that your Ladyship giue mee
leaue to be gone: for I can but sigh.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Nay stay: for now I beginne to sighe, I shall not
leaue, though you be gone. But what do you thinke best
for your sighing to take it away.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Yew Madame.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Mee?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  No Madame, yewe of the tree.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Then will I loue yewe the better. And indeede I
think it would make mee sleepe too, therfore all other
simples set aside, I will simply vse onely yewe.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Doe madame:for I think nothing in the world
so good as yewe.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Farewell for this time.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Is not your name Phao?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Phao, faire Venus, whom you made so faire.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  So passing faire, O faire Phao, O sweete Phao:
what wilt thou doe for Venus?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Anything that commeth in the compasse of
my poore fortune.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Cupid shal teach thee to shoote, & I will instruct
thee to dissemble.
               
               
                  
                  Phao.
                  I will learne any thing but dissembling.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Why my boy.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Because then I must learne to be a woman,
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Thou heardest that of a man.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Men speake trueth.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  But trueth is a she, and so alwaies painted.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  I thinke a painted trueth.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Well, farewell for this time; for I must visit Sapho.
               
               Phao exit.
            
         
         
            
               Actus quartus, Schaena prima.
               Venus, Sapho, Cupid.
               
                  Venus.
                  Sapho, I haue heard thy complaintes, and pittied
thine agonies.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  O Venus, my cares are onely knowne to thee,
and by thee only came the cause. Cupid, why didst thou
wound me so deepe?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  My mother bad me draw mine arrow to ye head.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Venus, why didst thou proue so hatefull?
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Cupid tooke a wrong shafte.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  O Cupid too vnkinde, to make me so kind, that
almost I transgresse the modestie of my kinde.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I was blind, and could not see mine arrow.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  How came it to passe, thou didst hit my hearte?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  That came by the nature of the head, which be
ing once let out of the bowe, cā finde none other lighting
place but the heart.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Be not dismaide, Phao shall yeelde.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  If hee yeelde, then shal I shame to embrace one
so meane if not, die: because I cannot embrace one so
meane. Thus doe I finde no meane.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Well, I will worke for thee. Farewell.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Farewell sweet Venus, and thou Cupid, which
art sweetest in thy sharpenesse.
                  Exit Sapho.
               
            
            
               Actus quartus, Schaena secunda.
               Venus, Cupid.
               
                  Venus.
                  Cupid, what haste thou done put thine arrowes

in Phaoes eies, and wounded thy mothers heart?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  You gaue him a face to allure, then why should
not I giue him eies to pearce?
               
               
                  Venus.
                  O Venus, vn happy Venus, who in bestowinge a
benefit vpon a man, haste brought a bane vnto a Goddesse.
What perplexities dost thou feele? O faire Phao,
and therefore made faire to breede in me a frenzie? O
would that when I gaue thee golden locks to curle thy
head, I had shackled thee with yron lockes on thy feete.
And when I noursed thee Sapho with lettice, woulde it
had turned to hemlocke, Haue I brought a smooth skin
ouer thy face to make a rough scarre in my heart? and
giuen thee a fresh colour like the damask rose, to make
mine pale like the stained Turkie. O Cupid, thy flames
with Psyches were but sparks, and my desires with Adonis
but dreames, in respecte of these vnacquainted tormentes.
Laugh Iuno, Venus is in loue, but Iuno shall not
see with whom, least shee be in loue. Venus belike is become
stale. Sapho forsooth because she hath many vertues,
therfore she must haue all the fauours. Venus waxeth
old: and then she was a pretie wench, when Iuno was
a young wife, nowe crowes foote is on her eie, and the
blacke oxe hath troad on her foote. But were Sapho neuer
so vertuous, doth she thinke to contend with Venus
to be as amorous? Yeelde Phao, but yeeld to me Phao,
I entreate where I may commaund, commaunde thou,
where thou shouldest entreate. In this case Cupid what
is thy coūsell, Venus must both play the louer & the dissembler,
& therfore the dissembler, because the Louer.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  You will euer be playing with arrows, like childrē
with kniues, & thē when you bleede, you cry, go to
Vulcan, entreat by praiers, threatē with blowes, wowe
with kisses, banne with curses, trie al meanes to rid these
extremities.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  To what end?
               
               
                  
                  Cupid.
                  That he might make mee new arrowes: for nothing
can roote out the desires of Phao, but a new shafte
of inconstancie, nor any thing turne Saphoeshart, but a
new arrow of disdaine. And then they dislyking one the
other, who shall inioy Phao but Venus?
               
               
                  Venus.
                  I will follow thy counsell. For Venus, though
she be in her latter age for yeares: yet is she in her Nonage
for affections. When Venus ceaseth to loue, let loue
cease to rule. But come, let vs to Vulcan.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus quartus, Schaena tertia.
               Sapho, Mileta, Ismena, Eugenna, Lamya, Fauilla, Canope.
               
                  Sapho.
                  What dreames are these Mileta? and can there
be no trueth in dreams? yea, dreams haue their trueth.
Me thought I saw a Stock doue or woodquist, I knowe
not how to tearm it, that brought short strawes to build
his neast in a tall Caedar, where, whiles with his bill hee
was framing his buylding, he lost as many fethers from
his wings, as he laid strawes in his neast: yet scambling
to catch hold to harbor in the house he had made, he so
denly fell from the bough where he stoode. And thē pitifully
casting vp his eies, he cried in such tearmes (as I
imagined) as might either cōdemne the nature of such
a tree, or the daring of such a minde. Whilest he lay quaking
vpō the ground, & I gazing one the Caeder, I might
perceiue Antes to breede in the rinde coueting only to
hoord, & caterpillers to cleaue to the leaues, labouring
only to suck, which caused mo leaues to fall frō the tree,
thē there did feathers before frō the doue. Me thought
Mileta, I sighed in my sleepe, pittying both the fortune
of the bird, & the misfortun of the tree but in this time
quils began to bud againe in the bird, which made him
looke as though he would flie vp, and then wished I that
the body of the tree woulde bowe, that hee might but
creepe vp the tree, then and so▪ Hey, ho.
               
               
                  
                  Milet.
                  And so what?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Nothing Mileta: but, and so I waked. But did
no bodie dreame but I?
               
               
                  Milet.
                  I dreamed last night, but I hope dreames are
contrary, that holding my heade ouer a sweete smoke,
al my haire blazd on a bright flame. Me thought Ismena
cast water to quench it: yet the sparks fell on my bosom,
and wiping them away with my hand, I was all in a gore
bloud, till one with a few fresh flowers staunched it. And
so stretching my self as stif I started, it was but a dream.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  It is a signe you shall fall in loue with hearinge
faire words. Water signifieth counsell, flowers death. And
nothing can purge your louing humour but death.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  You are no interpreter: but an interprater, harping
alwaies vpon loue, till you be as blind as a Harpar.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  I remember last night but one, I dreamed mine
eie tooth was lose, & that I thrust it out with my tonge.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  It foretelleth the losse of a friende: and I euer
thought thee so full of prattle, that thou wouldest thrust
out the best friend with the tatling.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Yea Mileta: but it was loose beefore, and if my
friend bee lose, as good thrust out with plaine words, as
kept in with dissembling.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  Dreams are but dotings, which come either by
things wee see in the day, or meates that we eate, and so
the common sense preferring it to bee the imaginatiue.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Softe Philosophatrix, well seene in the secretes of
arte, and not seduced with the superstitions of nature.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Ismenaes tongue neuer lyeth still, I think all her
teeth will bee loose, they are so often iogged againste her
tongue. But say on Eugenua.
               
               
                  Euge.
                  There is all.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  What did you dreame, Canope?
               
               
                  Cano.
                  I seldome dreame Madame: but sithence your
sicknesse, I cannot tell whether with ouer watching but I
haue had many phantastical visions, for euen now slumbring

by your beddes side, mee thought I was shadowed
with a clowd, where labouring to vnwrap my selfe, I was
more intangled. But in the midst of my striuing, it seemed
to mysell gold, with faire drops, I filled my lap, and
running to shew it my fellowes, it turned to duste, I blushed,
they laughed; and then I waked, being glad it was
but a dreame.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Take heede Canope, that gold tempt not your
lappe, and then you blush for shame.
               
               
                  Cano.
                  It is good lucke to dreame of gold.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Yea, if it had continued gold.
               
               
                  Lamya.
                  I dreame euery night, and the last night this. Me
though that walking in the sunne, I was stung with the
flye Tarantula, whose venom nothing can expell but the
sweete consent of musicke. I tried all kinde of instruments,
but found no ease, till at the last two Lutes tuned
in one key, so glutted my thirsting eares, that my griefe
presently seased, for ioye whereof as I was clapping my
handes, your Ladyship called.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  It is a signe that nothing shall asswage your loue
but mariage: for such is the tying of two in wedlocke, as
is the tuning of two Lutes, in one key: for strikinge the
stringes of the one, strawes will stirre vpon the stringes of
the other, and in two mindes lincked in loue, one cannot
be delighted but the other reioyceth.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  Mee thought going by the sea side amonge Pebels,
I sawe one playing with a rounde stone, euer throwing
it into the water, when the sunne shined: I asked
the name, hee saide, it was called Abeston, which being
once whotte, would neuer be cold, he gaue it me, and vanished.
I forgetting my selfe, delighted with the fayre
showe, woulde alwayes shewe it by candle light, pull it
out in the Sunne, and see howe bright it woulde look in
the fire, where catching heate, nothing could coole it:
for anger I threwe it against the wall, and with the heauing

vp of myne arme I waked.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Beware of loue, Fauilla: for women hearts are
such stones, which warmed by affection, cannot be coold
by wisdome.
               
               
                  Fauil.
                  I warrant you: for I neuer credit mennes words.
               
               
                  Isme.
                  Yet be warie▪ for women are scorched somtimes
with mens eies, though they had rather consume then
confesse.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Cease your talking: for I would faine sleepe, to
see if I can dreame, whether the birde hath feathers, or
the Antes winges. Draw the curteine.
               
            
            
               Actus quartus, Schaena quarta.
               Venus, Vulcan, Cupid.
               
                  Venus.
                  Come Cupid, Vulcans flames must quench Venus
fires. Vulcan?
               
               
                  Vulc.
                  Who?
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Venus.
               
               
                  Vulc.
                  Ho, ho, Venus.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Come sweete Vulcan, thou knowest how sweete
thou hast found Venus, who being, of all the gooddesses
the most faire, hath chosen thee of all the Gods the most
foule, thou must needes then confesse I was most louing.
Enquire not the cause of my suite by questions: but preuent
the effects by curtifie. Make me six arrowe heads: it
is giuen thee of the Gods by permission to frame them
to any purpose, I shall request them by praier. Why lowrest
thou Vulcan? wilt thou haue a kisse: holde vppe thy
head. Venus hath young thoughtes, and fresh affections.
Rootes haue stringes, when boughs haue no leaues. But
hearken in thine eare Vulcan: how saiest thou?
               
               
                  Vulc.
                  Vulcan is a God with you, when you are disposed
to flatter. A right womanne, whose tongue is lyke a

Bees stinge, which pricketh deepest, when it is fullest of
honnye. Because you haue made mine eies dronk with
fayre lookes, you wil set mine eares on edge with sweete
words. You were woont to say that the beating of hammers
made your head ake, and the smoake of the forge
your eies water, and euery coale was a blocke in your
way. You weepe rose water, when you aske, and spitte
vineger, when you haue obteined. What would you now,
with new arrowes? belike Mars hath a tougher skin one
his heart, or Cupid a weaker arme, or Venus a better courage.
VVell Venus, there is neuer a smile in your face
but hath made a wrinkle in my forehead. Ganymedes must
fill your cuppe▪ and you wil pledge none but Iupiter. But
I wil not chide Venus: Come Cyclops, my wife must haue
her will let vs doe that in earth, which the Gods cannot
vndoe in heauen.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Gramercie sweete Vulcan: to your worke.
               
               The Song in making of the Arrowes.
               
                  Vulc.
                  Heere Venus, I haue finished these arrowes
by arte, bestowe them you by witte: for as great aduise
must he vse that hath them, as hee cunning that made
them.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Vulcan, nowe you haue done with your forge,
lette vs alone with the fancye: you are as the Fletcher,
not the Archer, to meddle with the arrowe, not
the aime.
               
               
                  Vulc.
                  I thought so: when I haue done working, you
haue done woowing. Where is now sweete Vulcan? Wel,
I can say no more, but this which is enoughe, and as
much as any can say: Venus is a woman.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Bee not angrye Vulcan, I will loue thee agayne,
when I haue eyther businesse, or nothing els to
doe.
               
               
                  
                  Cupid.
                  My mother will make muche of you, when there
are no more men then Vulcan.
               
            
         
         
            
               Actus quintus, Schaena prima
               Venus, Cupid.
               
                  Venus.
                  Come Cupid, receiue with thy fathers instruments,
thy mothers instructions: for thou must be wise
in conceite, if thou wilt be fortunate in execution. This
arrow is feathered with the winges of Aegitus, which neuer
sleepeth for feare of his hen: the heade toucht with
the stone Perillus, which causeth mistruste and ielousie.
Shoote this, Cupid, at men that haue faire wiues, which
will make them rubbe the browes, when they swell in
the braines. This shaft is headed with Lidian steel, which
striketh a deepe disdain of yt which we most desire, ye feathers
are of Turtel, but dipped in the bloud of a Tigresse,
draw this vp close to the head at Sapho, that she may despise,
where now she doates. Good my boye, gall her on
the side, that for Phaos loue she may neuer sighe. This
arrow is feathered with the Phoenix winge, and headed
with the Eagles bill, it maketh mē passionate in desires,
in loue constant, and wise in conueiaunce, melting as it
were their fancies into faith: this arrowe, sweete childe,
and with as great ayme as thou canst, must Phao be striken
withall, and cry softly to thy selfe in the very loose,
Venus. Sweete Cupid mistake me not, I wil make a quiuer
for that by it selfe. The fourth hath feathers of the Peacocke,
but glewed with the gum of the Mirtle tree, headed
with fine golde, and fastened with brittle Chrysocoll:
this shoote at daintie and coy Ladies, at amiable and
young Nymphes, chuse no other white but women: for
this will worke lyking in their mindes, but not loue affabilitie
in speach, but no faith, courtly fauours, to bee

Mistresses ouer many, but constant to none: sighes to be
fetcht from the longes, not the heart, and teares to bee
wronge out with their fingers, not their eies, secrete
laughing at mens pale lookes and neate attire, open reioycinge
at their owne comlinesse and mens courtinge.
Shoote this arrowe among the thickest of them, whose
bosomes lye open, because they woulde be striken with
it. And seeing men tearme women Iupiters fooles, women
shall make men Venus fooles. This shafte is leade in
the head, and whose feathers are of the night Rauen, a
deadly and poysoned shafte, which breedeth hate onely
against those which sue for loue. Take heede Cupid thou
hitte not Phao with this shafte: for then shall Venus perishe.
This laste is an old arrow, but newlye mended, the
arrow which hitte both Sapho and Phao, working onely
in meane mindes an aspiring to superiours, & in high
estates a stooping to inferiours: with this Cupid I am
galled my selfe, till thou haue galled Phao with the other.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I warrant you I will cause Phao to languishe in
your loue and Sapho to disdaine his.
               
               
                  Venus
                  Goe, loyter not, nor mistake your shafte. Now
Venus, hast thou plaide a cunning parte, though not curraunt.
But why should Venus dispute of vnlawfulnesse in
loue, or faith in affection? beeing both the Goddesse of
loue and affection? knowing there is as litle trueth to
be vsed in loue, as there is reason. No, sweete Phao, Venus
will obtaine because she is venus. Not thou Ioue
with thūder in thy hand, shalt take him out of my hands.
I haue new arrowes now for my boy, and fresh flames, at
which the Gods shall tremble, if they beginne to trouble
me. But I will expect the euent, and tarye for Cupid
at the forge▪

                  Cupid.
                  That my mother commaunded, Sapho.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  My thinkes I feele an alteration in my minde,
and as it were a withstanding in my self of mine own affections.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Then hath mine arrow his effect.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  I pray thee tell me the cause?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I dare not.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Feare nothing: for if Venus fret, Sapho canne
frowne, thou shalt bee my sonne. Mileta▪ giue him some
sweete meates, speake good Cupid, and I will giue thee
many pretie things.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  My mother is in loue with Phao, she willed mee
to strike you with disdain of him, and him with desire
of her.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  O spitefull Venus, Mileta giue him some of that.
What els Cupid?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I could be euen with my mother: and so I will,
if I shall call you mother?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Yea Cupid, call me any thing, so I may be euen
with her.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I haue an arrow, with which if I strike Phao, it
will cause him to loth onely Venus.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Sweete Cupid, strike Phao with it. Thou shalt
sitte in my lappe, I will rocke thee asleepe, and feede thee
with all these fine knackes.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I will about it.
                  Exit Cupid.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  But come quickly againe. Ah vnkinde Venus,
is this thy promise to Sapho? But if I gette Cuppid from

thee, I my selfe will be the Queene of loue. I will direct
these arrowes with better aime, and conquer mine own
affections, with greater modesty. Venus heart shal flame,
and her loue be as common as her crafte. O Mileta, time
hath disclosed that, which my temperance hath kept in:
but sith I am rid of the disease, I will not be ashamed to
confesse the cause. I loued Phao Mileta, a thing vnfit for
my degree, but forced by my desire.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  Phao?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Phao, Mileta, of whom nowe Venus is inamoured.
               
               
                  Milet.
                  And doe you loue him still.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  No, I feele relenting thoughtes, and reason not
yeelding to appetite. Let Venus haue him, no, shee shall
not haue him. But here coms Cupid. How now my boy,
haste thou done it?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Yea, and left Phao rayling on Venus, and cursing
her name: yet stil sighing for Sapho, and blafing her
vertues.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Alas poore Phao, thy extreame loue should not
be requited with so meane a fortune, thy faire face deserued
greater fauours: I cannot loue, Venus hath hardened
my heart.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  I meruale Cupid commeth not all this while.
How now, in Saphoes lappe?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Yea Venus, what say you to it, in Saphoes lap.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Sir boy, come hither?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I will not.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  What now? will you not? hath Sapho made you
so sawcie?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  I wil be Saphoes sonne, I haue as you commanded
striken her with a deepe disdaine of Phao, and Phao
as she entreated me, with a great despite of you.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Vnhappy wag, what hast thou done? I will make
thee repent it euery vaine in thy heart.
               
               
                  
                  Sapho.
                  Venus be not collerick, Cupid is mine, he hath
giuen me his Arrowes, and I will giue him a new bowe to
shoote in. You are not worthy to be the Ladye of loue,
that yeelde so often to the impressions of loue. Immodest
Venus, that to satisfie the vnbrideled thoughtes of
thy hearte, transgressest so farre from the staye of thine
honour. Howe sayest thou Cupid, wilt thou bee with
me?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Shall not I bee on earth the Goddesse of affections?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Shall not I rule the fansies of men, and leade Venus
in chaines like a captiue?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  It is a good boy.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  What haue we here? you the Goddesse of Loue?
and you her sonne, Cupid? I will tame that proud heart,
els shall the Gods say, they are not Venus friendes. And
as for you, sit boy, I will teach you how to run away: you
shalbe stript from toppe to toe, and whipt with nettles,
not roses. I will set you to blowe Vulcans coales, not to
beare Venus quiuer, I will handle you for this geare:
well, I say no more. But as for the new Mistresse of loue,
or Lady, I cry you mercie, I think you would be called a
Goddesse, you shall know what it is to vsurpe the name
of Venus. I will pull those plumes, and cause you to cast
your eyes on your feete, not your feathers: your softe
hayre will I turne to harde bristles, your tongue to a
stinge, and those alluring eyes to vnluckynes, in which
if the Gods ayde me not, I will cursse the Gods.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Venus, you are in a vaine aunswerable to your
vanitie, whose highe woordes neither beecome you,
nor feare mee. But lette this suffice, I will keepe Cupid
in dispighte of you, and yet with the contente of the
Gods.
               
               
                  
                  Venus.
                  Will you? why then we shal haue pretie Gods
in heauen, when you take Gods prisoners on earth. Before
I sleepe you shall both repent, and finde what it is
but to thinke vnreuerently of Venus. Come Cupid, shee
knowes not how to vse thee, come with mee, you knowe
what I haue for you: will you not?
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  Not I.
               
               
                  Venus.
                  Well, I will be euen with you both, & that shortlye,
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  Cupid, feare not, I will direct thine arrowes better.
Euery rude asse shall not say he is in loue. It is a toye
made for Ladies, and I will keepe it onely for Ladies.
               
               
                  Cupid.
                  But what will you doe for Phao?
               
               
                  Sapho.
                  I wil wish him fortunate. This wil I do for Phao,
because I once loued Phao: for neuer shall it be said that
Sapho loued to hate, or that out of loue she coulde not
be as courteous, as she was in loue passionate. Come
Mileta, shut the doore.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Actus quintus, Schaena tertia.
               Phao. Sybilla.
               
                  Phao.
                  Goe to Sybilla, tell the beginning of thy loue,
and the end of thy fortune. And loe how happilye shee
sitteth in her caue. Sybilla?
               
               
                  Syb.
                  Phao, welcome, what newes?
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Venus, the Goddesse of loue I loth, Cupid causd
it with a new shafte. Sapho disdaineth mee, Venus causd
it for a new spite. O Sybilla, if Venus be vnfaithfull in
loue, where shall one flye for trueth? Shee vseth deceite,
is it not then likely she will dispence with subtiltie. And
being carefull to commit iniuries, will shee not be carelesse
to reuenge them? I must nowe fall from loue to labour,

and endeuour with mine oare to gette a fare, not
with my penne to write a fancie. Loues are but smokes,
which vanish in the seeing, and yet hurte whilest they
are seene. A Ferrie Phao, no the starres cannot call it a
worser fortune. Raung rather ouer the world, forsweare
affections, entreate for death. O Sapho, thou haste Cupid
in thine armes, I in my hearte, thou kissest him for
sporte, I muste curse him for spite: yet will I not curse
him Sapho, whome thou kissest. This shalbe my resolutiō,
where euer I wāder, to be as I were euer kneeling
before Sapho, my loyalty vnspotted, though vnrewarded.
With as litle malice wil I goe to my graue, as I did
lye with all in my cradle. My life shalbe spente in sighing
and wishing, the one for my bad fortune, the other for
Saphoes good.
               
               
                  Sybil.
                  Doe so Phao: for destinie calleth thee aswell
from Sycily as from loue. Other things hange ouer thy
head, which I must neither tell, nor thou enquire. And
so farewell.
               
               
                  Phao.
                  Farewell Sybilla, and farewell Sycily. Thoughtes
shalbe thy foode, and in thy steppes shalbe printed beehinde
thee, that there was none so loyall lefte behinde
thee. Farewell Syracusa, vnworthy to harbour faith, and
when I am gone, vnlesse Sapho be here, vnlikely to harbour
any.
               
            
         
         
            
            The Epilogue.
            
               THey that treade in a maze, walke oftentimes
in one path, & at the last come out
where they entred in. Wee feare we haue
lead you all this while in a Labyrinth of
conceites, diuerse times hearing one deuice,
& haue now brought you to an end,
where we first beganne. Which wearisome trauaile, you
must impute to the necessitie of the hystorie, as Theseus
did his labour to the arte of the Labyrinth. There is nothing
causeth such giddines, as going in a wheele, neither
cā there any thing breede such tediousnesse, as hearing
manie words vttered in a small compass. But if you
accept this daūce of a Farie in a circle, wee will herafter
at your willes frame our fingers to all formes. And so
we wish euery one of you a thread to leade you out of
the doubts, wherwith we leaue you intangled: that nothing
be mistaken by our rash ouersightes, nor misconstrued
by your deepe insights.
