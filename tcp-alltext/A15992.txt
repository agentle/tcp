            TO MY MOST
BELOVED AND
WORTHY GOOD
FRIEND,
Mr. HENRY KING,
Arch-Deacon of
Colchester.
            
               IT pleased you long since at my request, to present
this holy Song to my honourable good
Lord, and your most deare and louing Father.
Whose worthy approbation hath encouraged
me to publish it, intending the Dedication
to his euer-honoured memorie. But God hauing now
taken him to himselfe, and left vs to bewaile our inestimable
losse (it being printed before his Death) I resolue not to alter
the Dedication, but desire you his liuing Heire to accept
it in his Name: praying the Lord of all Grace (who hath
made you Heire of his Graces and Vertues) to make you Coheire
with him of eternall Happinesse, resting alwayes
            
               Your owne,
R. A.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT
REVEREND FATHER
IN GOD,
IOHN,
LORD BISHOP OF
LONDON.
            
               
                  ACcept (my Lord) into your Treasurie
               Of Wisedome, Learning, this deuoted Mite;
               In Widdowes offering out of penurie;
               Thy Lord did more, than richest gifts delight.
               Your Lordships worthy fauours did inuite
               Mee to this boldnesse, when you first did raise
               My lot which in obscuritie was light,
               In better Fortunes for to spend my dayes,
               For which I blesse your bountie, and my Maker praise.
            
            
               As little Brookes which from the Ocean wide
               Receiue their Source, thence watering hollow vaines
               Of fruitfull Earth, backe to the Sea doe slide,
               Yeelding some Drops of Tribute for their gaines:
               Euen so a thankfull heart my Muse constraines,
               This Tribute to your Bountie to repay,
               And consecrate my labour and my paines
               Vnto your Seruice, which I humbly pray,
               Like Mite, to Treasure; Drop, to Ocean, answer may.
            
            
               
               My Muse once rashly sought to enterprise,
               To ranke thine Honour in the Court of Fame;
               
               But knowing Thou such Glorie didst despise,
               (In white stone seeking a new written Name,
               Which he knowes onely that receiues the same:)
               I chose this Song of Christ and's Church to sing,
               Where if mine ignorance commerit blame,
               I doe submit it to thy censuring,
               Who art in pardoning, and giuing like a King.
               
            
            
               With Spirit of Moses, Iosuahs fortitude,
               The Faith of Abram, Isaacks happy peace,
               With Dauids heart, Iobs patience be indu'd;
               With Salomons wealth, and vvisdomes good increase,
               From Samuels dealing Iustice, neuer cease
               Be blest like Iob in his last happy broode,
               With Pauls content, be it in paine or ease,
               Let Churches hidden Manna be thy food,
               Thy daies and strength, like Calebs, happy, long & good.
            
            
               Your Lordships most bounden
and deuoted,

                  I Out of Pulpit oft haue beene thy Teacher;
               Now in this Booke thou art to me a Preacher,
               God grant what's there and here deliuered,
               May daily in our liues be practised.

               To The Authour.
               THis Worke diuine to paint with commendation,
               Were sure a worke of supererogation
               In mee, yet in plaine english I say this,
               The Booke's the theorie, the practice His.

               WHen I at home thy Practice doe behold,
               Me thinks it goes beyond all contemplation,
               But soone this Booke hath that conceit control'd,
               And rays'd my soule to heau'nly admiration,
               Thy skill so here thy Practice doth transcend,
               I see there's none so good but may amend.

               OF making many Bookes there is no end,
               And too much reading wearieth the flesh,
               But more that I to reading these intend,
               They more my Soule and Spirit doe refresh.

WHICH WAS
SALOMONS.
                  
                     The Argument.
                     MY Muse, that whilome, swaid by lust of youth,
                     Did spend her strength in idle wanton toyes,
                     Now viewes her vanity, with mickle ruth,
                     And as awak'd doth seeke for solid ioyes,
                     Such as pure soules to blessednesse conuoyes:
                     This is the cause why shee so much doth long,Act. 2. 3.
                     
                     His grace implor'd who in a mighty noyse
                     Appear'd in clouen tongues, to teach my tongue
                     To sing these sacred mysteries, this SALOMONS song.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. I.
                     
                        
                           The Churches loue to Christ shee doth defend,
                           And cleere her selfe from all indignitie:
                           She cals her Spouse, who shewes her how to wend,
                           They bothdelight in sweet communitie.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           WIth kisses of thy mouth doe thou me kisse:Church.
                        
                        Thy loue is better vnto me then wine,
                        Thine oyntments sauour good and pleasant is,
                        A sweet perfume is that blest Name of thine,
                        Therefore the Maydes all in thy loue combine.
                        Oh draw me, and we after thee will run,
                        If to thy treasures thou our hearts incline,
                        We will reioyce, and in that ioy begun,
                        We will recount thy loues, with all that errours shun.
                     
                     
                        
                        Scorne me not (Sions Nymphes) though I seeme browne
                        For I am faire and comely, as a Rose,
                        I (till Sunnes scorching beames on me did frowne,)
                        Was like those that in Salomons tents repose:
                        My Mothers sonnes my beauty did expose
                        To the Sunnes heate, and raging, me abiected,
                        So did they me a baser way dispose
                        To keepe strange Vineyards not to be respected,
                        Whil'st mine (ay me) lay vnmanur'd quite neglected.
                     
                     
                        Oh tell me where, thou whom my soule doth loue,
                        Thou feed'st thy Sheepe, and rests them at noone day:
                        For why alas should I a strag'er proue,
                        And feede my flocks with them that goe astray?
                        Fairest of mayds,Christ. since thou know'st not the way
                        Tread not in steps that into errours moue;
                        But leade thou forth thy Kids to leape and play
                        Vpon the hills, the Shepheards tents aboue,
                        To Pharaoh's Hoste and Charrets I compare my loue,
                     
                     
                        Thy comely cheekes are deckt with orient stones,
                        Thine iu'ry neck with spangles all is graced,
                        Yet will we make thee farre more precious ones
                        Of gold and siluer ioyntly enterlaced.
                        When as my King is at the table placed,Church.
                        
                        He sends forth smells most odoriferous:
                        By night he like a bunch of Myrrhe embraced
                        My loue is like a Cypresse berry'd bush,
                        Which in the gardens of Engaddi men doe crush.
                     
                     
                        Faire is my loue,Christ. behold my loue is faire,
                        Thine eyes are like the eyes of turtle doue,
                        And my beloued is most debonaire,Church.
                        
                        Pleasant and fruitfull flourishing in loue:
                        Our house with Cedars all is seel'd aboue,
                        And all our walkes are planted like a Cypresse groue,

                           Their mutuall commendation, and their feast:
                           His fainting Spouse with loue Christ doth refresh;
                           He calls her forth to Gardens neately drest:
                           The Church doth Faith and Hope in him professe.

                        Eu'n as a Lilly which the thornes doe throng,Christ.

                        And with sweete loue as with a Banner doth me guide.

                           Chaste Ladies loues, and Nobles courtesie.
                           Of such haue Homer, Virgil, Spencer told,
                           And haue thereby their names in Fames faire Court enrold.

                           This sure their most Heroicke Muse might raise,
                           As farre aboue their moderne pitch to flie,
                           As candle-light's surmounted by Sunnes rayes,
                           Or as the Creatures boasting is by Makers praise.

                           Nor had their stately Muse beene rais'd more high,
                           By this employment in Loues Meditation,
                           Than their owne soules, which vp to

                           Prepared for the faithfull Friends of Loue,
                           That by her Lawes frame life and conuersation,
                           As Members of one glorious Head aboue,
                           Which here vpon the Earth by it doe liue, be, moue.
                        
                        
                           4
                           Long time I sought Loues Court most carefully,
                           And on her noble Actions set my mind,
                           That, in her praise, my Muse might soare on high,
                           I sought in vaine, but could no entrance find,
                           Vntill a courteous Lady then assign'd
                           To keepe the Court Gate, hight Humilitie,
                           
                           Well knowing what I sought, lowly declin'd,
                           Assuring me I neuer could descrie,
                           Loues honourable Court, but by Humilitie.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           5
                           Shee was a louely Lady cloth'd in gray,
                           Of russet wooll, which her owne hands did spin,
                           Nor would expend her state in garments gay,
                           Her care was to be glorious within;
                           Yet had this Lady goodly commings in,
                           Which for Loues sake shee dealt amongst the Poore,
                           To fill their bellies shee look'd leane and thin,
                           Would stoupe to heale the meanest Lazars sore,
                           Yet when shee had done all, grieu'd shee could doe no more.
                        
                        
                           6
                           Shee soone in me espies a dangerous sore,
                           Most dangerous, because it was least seene,
                           But inwardly did fester more and more;
                           It was Ambition, which eu'n from my Spleene
                           Vnto mine heart had sent her poysonous teene;
                           To cure which sore, shee med'cine streight applyes,
                           Before I came in presence of her Queene.
                           Who gaynes, saith shee, grace in my Soueraignes eyes,
                           By meekenesse, not ambition, seekes, as I, to rise.
                        
                        
                           7
                           Many good med'cines did this Maid deuise,
                           Whereby shee might recure my dangerous sore,
                           As good examples, words eke of the wise,
                           But none of these did yeeld me profit more,
                           Than mine owne wretchednesse; which shee before
                           Me laid; that I might humbled be thereby,
                           And though my flesh first spurn'd against this lore,
                           Yet shee so gently did this salue apply,
                           That my proud heart it made stoupe to Humilitie.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           8
                           Thus humbled, I was to Repentance brought,
                           Who was the Marshall, wondrous graue and sage,
                           Ah! shee, at first, me
                                 •
                              ickle sorrow wrought,
                           And shew'd how I vnworthy was to wage,
                           Or be admitted to Loues equipage.
                           Shee then my conscience forthwith did demand,
                           To bring my Sinnes and Follies on the stage;
                           Who, streight-wayes, did obey her great command;
                           And, loe! my sinnes appear'd in number like the Sand.
                        
                        
                           9
                           Sinnes done in secret, and long since forgot,
                           Shee there exhibited plaine to bee seene,
                           And straight me to the Barre of Iustice got,
                           Accusing of high treason to her Queene:
                           
                              Iustice was chiefe Iudge, in the Law well seene,
                           Yet limited by bounds of her Commission;
                           Law was her rule, not what shee did esteeme,
                           To extend Mercy shee had no permission:
                           They that haue sinn'd must be condemn'd without remission.
                        
                        
                           10
                           But Faith and Hope, two Patrons neare at hand
                           To all distressed soules that craue their aide,
                           Aduis'd me not on mine owne workes to stand,
                           But on His merits that had fully paid
                           The ransome of my sinnes; and further said,
                           From Iustice I to Mercy might appeale.
                           This done, the Court most willingly conuaid
                           Me to the Throne of Mercy, which should heale,
                           And all by Iustice done against me, would repeale.
                        
                        
                           
                           11
                           
                              Mercy a Princesse was of high degree,
                           And neare vnto the Queene of Loue allide;
                           Most pleasant was her countenance to see:
                           
                              Knowledge the Treasurer sate by her side;
                           But Prudence most of all her Grace did guide.
                           The Secretarie Truth her Acts did write,
                           Shee Mercy yet with Iustice did diuide,
                           To all those Suitors that did craue their right;
                           And were, by Faith and Hope, taught how to plead aright.
                        
                        
                           12
                           I had good audience at my first appearing,
                           But when Faith, Hope, began my suite to moue,
                           
                              Repentance crau'd another day of hearing,
                           And shee would all my sinnes before them proue;
                           I answer'd, that this let I would remoue,
                           For I confesse all against me laid,
                           And streight by Faith and Hope did plainely proue,
                           My Sauiours merits, all my debts had paid;
                           Then all the Court gan cry, I need not be afraid.
                        
                        
                           13
                           Yet Mercy with her counsell would aduise,
                           Before that shee to sentence did proceed,
                           And first with Knowledge, Prudence, Truth deuise,
                           The same which was long time before decreed▪
                           
                           And though damnation be thy sinnes iust meed,
                           Yet seeing thou so rightly dost apply
                           Christs merits, thou, from guilt of them art freed:
                           Wherefore by Faith, Hope, and Humilitie,
                           
                           In Loues Court to abide, thou hast free libertie.

                           I thus absolu'd, by Mercies gracious dome
                           Was brought to Meekenesse and Obedience,
                           
                           That they might me instruct, ere I should come
                           Into the Chamber of their Queenes presence:
                           And by the way I met with Patience;
                           
                           These three sweet Ladies many precepts giue,
                           With charge the same t' obserue with diligence,
                           And all my wrongs past and to come forgiue,
                           If in this Court of Loue, with honour, I would liue.

                           Then Fortitude, this Queenes great Generall,
                           Taught me'gainst all afflictions to stand fast,
                           For he that loueth well endureth all;
                           And Temperance enioyned me to fast,
                           And all immoderate lusts from me to cast;
                           This Temperance, Comptroller of the Hall,
                           Of slender dyet is and body chast;
                           
                              Bountie the Alm'ner next to me did call,

                           16
                           Then Lady Laetice, that staid all this while,
                           Longing and wishing me this good successe,
                           On me began most graciously to smile,
                           And comfort after my great heauinesse:
                           Shee is of high trust and great noblenesse,
                           And keepes the priuy Signet of her Queene,
                           Which on the hearts of all shee doth impresse,
                           Absolu'd by Mercy from Lawes direfull teene:
                           Shee is call'd Inward Ioy, more to be felt then seene.
                        
                        
                           
                           17
                           There met I Zeale without vaine superstition,
                           Who neuer, without Knowledge, durst come there,
                           So hot and fiery was her disposition,
                           As shee in peeces could stone tables teare;
                           Shee in graue comely habit did appeare,
                           As of the Tribe of Aaron shee were borne;
                           Gods Name dishonoured shee could not beare,
                           Her haire was all discheuelled and torne,
                           Which she had rent to hear wretches her queenes loue scorne.
                        
                        
                           18
                           Shee was most earnest and patheticall,
                           And like Ioy, did enflame mine inward parts:
                           Then Courtesie a Lady faire and tall,
                           Instructed me in her most pleasing Arts,
                           How first I should my lookes suite to mine heart,
                           And next according to mine heart should looke,
                           Vnfeignedly the head and euery part,
                           To loue, who for loue my sinnes on him tooke;
                           This Ladies louing heart, you might reade in her looke.
                        
                        
                           19
                           Then came Gods Word, of all the rest, the Guide,
                           From whose Mouth went a sharpe two edged sword,
                           Which did from me all sinne and lust diuide,
                           And in my bleeding wounds sweet hony powr'd:
                           Last, Prayer needes this fauour would afford,
                           My suite vnto Loues Highnesse to present.
                           Then falling on my knees, shee did record
                           My words, and eu'n my secret hearts intent,
                           And them, by Mediation, to Loues presence sent.
                        
                        
                           
                           20
                           Thus was I to Loues glorious presence brought,
                           Which was beyond imagination great,
                           Who gently me enquired what I sought:
                           Madame, said I, This now I doe intreat,
                           Your Grace will giue me licence to repeat
                           The goodly glorie I doe here behold:
                           Shee granted me I should of her entreat,
                           And all her Courtiers, whereof I haue told,
                           Which by Gods grace I meane in order to vnfold.
                        
                        
                           21
                           And that I may an order due obserue,
                           The first that comes forth is the Queene her Grace,
                           Then follow on such Ladies as her serue,
                           In their due order, ranke, and proper place.
                           
                              Humilitie first leades the Vertues trace:
                           Loe, next Repentance, Faith, and Hope haue rome:
                           These three are Ladies which doe guide our race,
                           Till we into the armes of Loue doe come;
                           But, loe, they leaue vs there; for then their charge is done.

                           My Muse here onely labours to indite,
                           Of that free Loue, which doth from thence descend,

                           And that which from them ought againe ascend;

                           The Sonne is of the Father all alone,
                           The Spirit from Sonne and Father doth proceede;
                           So though a threefold kind of Loue we reade,
                           Yet is this true and heau'nly Loue but one,
                           For, with that Loue from Father doth proceede,
                           Christ loueth those he chooseth for his owne,
                           And we the selfe-same loue to Head and Members showne.

                           Had caused those celestiall Lamps of light,
                           The Angels that kept not their first estate,
                           To be deiected from thy Palace bright,
                           Reseru'd in euerlasting chaines of darkest night.

                           For bearing him with paine and losse of rest,
                           With many troubles shee in nursing found:
                           So should our Loue vnto our Lord abound,
                           By whose Crosse we are new borne from aboue,
                           And nurs'd with Blood that floweth from his Wound,
                           His Flesh we eate, his Blood we drinke, and proue
                           Flesh of his Flesh, Bone of his Bone, by Faith and Loue.
                        
                        
                           41
                           Behold, here is a Sea of Mysterie,
                           Where Lambs may wade, and Elephants may swim,
                           And both be drown'd, except sweet Loue stand by;
                           By Faith we onely wade about the brim
                           Of this deepe Sea, by Loue vp to the chin.
                           It is a mysterie, which to vnfold,
                           No speech is able, 'tis the heart within,
                           To which this mysterie is plainely told:
                           This secret, Babes and Sucklings doe through Loue behold.
                        
                        
                           42
                           Loue's like to Oile, that, in Zarepta's Cruse,
                           By spending on the Prophet, did increase;
                           Like Sunne, which light doth into all infuse,
                           Yet doth thereby his light no whit decrease,
                           Like boundlesse Waters of the bounteous Seas,
                           Which faile not, though on all the Flouds they spend;
                           Like Leaches skill, by vse which gaynes increase,
                           Like feruent Prayer, which the Cloudes transcend,
                           Yet by her daily vse in strength and growth doth mend.
                        
                        
                           43
                           Loue's like pure liuing Streames in Pipes, which flow
                           From some faire Conduit built vpon a Hill,
                           Which though they moisten all the Vales below,
                           And many Offices with Water fill;
                           Yet to as high a pitch remounten still,
                           As is the Fountayne from whence first they fall,
                           Eu'n so Loues streames, which from our head distill
                           Vpon the lowest Member here of all,
                           Mount vp, from whence they came, with source perpetuall.

                           But why seeke I by simile's t' expresse,
                           The heau'nly Nature of this glorious Queene,
                           Since Men and Angels greatest noblenesse,
                           But eu'n as shadowes to the substance beene,
                           If with her most celestiall splendour seene:
                           Let dust and ashes dare then be so bold,
                           His Maker to compare with Loues great Queene,
                           So I her heau'nly graces may vnfold,
                           And you the plainlier may her glorie great behold.

                           46
                           The King of Heau'n, for Man, did on him take
                           A Seruants forme, eu'n so this heau'nly Peere,
                           Her selfe a Seruant vnto Man doth make.
                           The whole Law God for vs fulfilled heere,
                           And Loue vs from the guilt thereof doth cleare;
                           If you will grant similitudes may proue,
                           By thousands I can make it plaine appeare,
                           Loue's like in all to God in heau'n aboue,
                           Yea, Loue is God himselfe: for God is called Loue.
                        
                        
                           47
                           As in the Frame and Microcosme of Man,
                           The Soules great power all other motions sway,
                           And the whole Frame which of the Chaos came,
                           To the prime Mouer alwayes doth obay;
                           So doe all spirituall heau'nly Vertues ay,
                           Depend vpon this gracious Queene of Loue,

                           Two things obserue in Loue, longing, delight;
                           Longing to get; Delight, when we obtayne:
                           Loe, Loue with longing doth our hearts inuite
                           Vnto the feast, where Christ shall entertayne▪
                           
                           Virgins that in their Lamps sweet Oile maintayne;
                           Those that are in the wedding Garment drest,
                           Where they with him shall euermore remayne,

                           As is Loues Obiect, so indeed is Loue,
                           Constant, delightfull, happy, permanent,
                           If we affection set on things aboue,

                           In holy Men, when yet the Law had place,
                           As Abram, Moses, Iob, and Dauid bold,
                           But they haue shined more now vnder Grace
                           Amongst those that haue seene our Sauiours face,
                           But most since he the Comforter hath sent,
                           Stones, Fagots, Swords, Sawes, Crosses they embrace,
                           As if they did their Sauiour represent,
                           Shewing by losse of their deare Blood their true intent.

                           Of Gods loue t'vs, and ours to God againe;
                           Yea, when most en'mies seeke Loue to confound,
                           Shee doth her owne most valiantly maintayne,
                           No horror, death, cold, hunger, losse, or paine,
                           Saints, from their Loue to Christ, can separate,
                           Their Martyrdome's their Crowne; their losse, their gaine;
                           Their Captaynes death Souldiers doth not amate,
                           They know this is the way in at the narrow Gate.

                           Doing of good, our sinnes vpon him takes,

                           What doe we saue if we the world should gayne,
                           And lose our Crowne which vp in Heau'n is layne?
                           Who hauing this worlds good, and doth behold
                           His brother want, yet doth his hand retayne,
                           How can it be but Loue in him is cold?
                           For whereas Loue doth dwell, her fruits are manifold.
                        
                        
                           58
                           Oh! come all yee then, that forget the Lord;
                           Behold his loue to Man with admiration!
                           Oh, let our loue such fruits to Saints afford,
                           They may blesse God for such refocillation.
                           Mount vp my soule by heau'nly contemplation,
                           Behold him in his Maiestie aboue!
                           Behold him in his wonderfull creation!
                           In's Wisedome and his Prouidence, and proue
                           If all these counterpoise his Bountie, Mercy, Loue.
                        
                        
                           59
                           And if his loue's so great and wonderfull,
                           Most precious sure's the Obiect of his loue,
                           Out of this Worlds great treasurie to cull
                           One, whom he would eternally aboue
                           Make happy with his presence: and to proue
                           So kind a Father, Him Coheire to take
                           To his owne deare beloued Sonne: to loue
                           Him as his owne, for his owne Sonnes deare sake.

                           Since in respect of thee this World is base?
                           No thing created in the World is found,
                           Which God vouchsafed hath so much to grace.
                           His free Loue doth aduance thee to this place,
                           Requiring of thee this one complement,
                           Thou him and his againe with loue embrace,
                           For Loue fulfilleth the Commandement,
                           Command Lord what thou wilt, Loue makes obedient.

                           How doth the World bewitch thee? How possesse?
                           How are thy thoughts tane vp with worldly care?

                           Oh, neuer let such dismall heauinesse
                           Cleaue on my Soule, through vnbeliefe to die,
                           For which Christ offred vp himselfe so louingly.

                           That all things in this World are vanitie,
                           No true content to mortall e're hath beene,
                           But that which doth endure eternally?
                           As Primum mobile Loue doth employ
                           All other Graces in their proper motion,
                           And as all Spheres are mou'd perpetually
                           By the prime Mouer, so Loues purest Notion,

                           Wherewith thy Lord inuites thee vnto Grace?
                           And as a Father, Husband, Friend thee moue,

                           Abandoning vaine wealth and worlds delight,
                           The World and all things in it are but base,
                           To ransome one poore Soule all is too light,
                           In this Gods Loue doth more then all his Power and Might.

                           Thy Statutes then I neuer should forget,

                           65
                           Oh, that my dearest Husband, Father, Friend,
                           His heau'nly Loue into mine heart would shower!
                           That my Loue may againe to him ascend,
                           And that I may with all my might and power,

                           But though, alas, this heau'nly Loue I feele

                           The Head nor Members, which in earthly Bower
                           Most deare and precious in his sight remayne,
                           But hardly can from Enuie, Hatred, Pride refrayne.

                           And grant that all the good I doe, I may
                           Performe it well, with good and due respect

                           In weight and number: yet I firme would stand,
                           What though eternall fire be sinnes iust meed?
                           Much is forgiu'n, where is much loue indeed;
                           Wherefore mine Heart and Soule shall euer praise
                           My Maker, that in me such loue doth breed,
                           That doth my Soule from hellish horror raise
                           Aboue the Heau'ns, to liue the life of Loue alwayes.
                        
                        
                           
                           76
                           As alwayes for thy loue, so at this time
                           I praise thee for this holy Meditation
                           Of heau'nly Loue: of all the Graces prime,
                           Which by thy grace doe worke out our saluation;
                           And pay the score and price of our damnation:
                           I alwayes will acknowledge and confesse
                           Thy Power and Bountie in our first Creation;
                           But now mine heart vnable to expresse
                           Thy Loue in our Redemption, here with ioy doth cease.
                        
                        
                           77
                           And pray's that whilst I Loue to others preach,
                           My selfe may not become a reprobate,
                           Like as I oft haue seene a skilfull Leach,
                           Carelesse of his owne health and fraile estate;
                           But grant that as this Song I doe relate
                           Of heau'nly Loue, it may my Soule here moue
                           To be as true as Turtle to her Mate:
                           That neuer worldly cares my heart remoue
                           From this most precious Pearle: this true and heau'nly Loue.
                        
                        
                           78
                           Had I not told, you wonder might, how I
                           So meane a wretch, in presence came of Loue;
                           But, as I said, Madame Humilitie
                           Me first directed to her Court to moue;
                           And from mine heart Ambition did remoue;
                           For, from my youth, I had a great desire,
                           To view th' estate and blisse of glorious Loue,
                           But, oft in vaine, I did thereto aspire,
                           Till Humblenesse me taught: of whom I next enquire.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        MEDITAT. II.
                        Of Humiliti
                              •
                           .
                        
                           1
                           
                              MY boundlesse thoughts, that in a restlesse mind,
                           Depriue my body oft of naturall rest,
                           And vrge my soule true happinesse to find,
                           And that once found therein to set my rest,
                           Doe often to my purer Soule suggest,
                           To seeke for pleasures, honour, wealth, promotion;
                           But more of them I gayne, the more opprest
                           I am with worldly cares, and mindes commotion,
                           So that to nothing in this World I haue deuotion.
                        
                        
                           2
                           And yet I see, all Things that being haue,
                           Vnto their Bene esse doe intend,
                           Their Summum bonum 'tis that all doe craue,
                           First sought for, though they last it apprehend:
                           Loue is that good I seeke to apprehend,
                           As all Things being to their end doe moue;
                           But none but by Humilitie can wend
                           Into Loues Court, without her none can proue
                           What is the end and finishing of all true Loue.
                        
                        
                           3
                           Therefore I sing next of Humilitie,
                           The lowly Porter of high Loues Court gate,
                           Who brought me first Loues glorious Court to see,
                           And all her Courtiers, as I told of late:
                           Humilitie the poorest beggars Mate,
                           Yet equall to the highest Peere of Loue,
                           And by her vs'd in all affaires of State,
                           Humilitie which doth so gracious proue
                           To all good Men on earth, and Angels pure aboue.
                        
                        
                           
                           4
                           God! second Person in the Trinitie,
                           Whose being is immortall, vncreate,
                           Who in the dayes of thy Humilitie,
                           Didst here conuerse with Men in meane estate,
                           That we thy lowlinesse might imitate,
                           Direct my Muse most liuely to expresse
                           Humilitie, that opens wide Loues gate
                           To those, that doe confesse their wretchednesse,
                           But shuts close 'gainst all proud and vaine ambitious ghests.
                        
                        
                           5
                           Humilitie that vertue is, whereby
                           We vile and lowly seeme in our owne eyes;
                           Despising our owne worth and dignitie,
                           Since of our selues we nothing haue to prise:
                           The first and certayne step whereby we rise,
                           And climbe the Hill of Ioy and Happinesse;
                           Stranger to fooles companion of the wise.
                           Of Folly, Pride; of Grace comes humblenesse;
                           One head-long leades to Hell, the other vnto Blesse.
                        
                        
                           6
                           This modest Lady, Humblenesse of Spirit,
                           Her selfe vnwise and ignorant doth deeme,
                           And neuer thinkes shee able is to merit,
                           In Loues high Court to be in such esteeme,
                           Shee farre inferiour to her selfe doth seeme,
                           And neuer thinkes shee Knowledge can attayne,
                           Disgrace or losse shee sweetly doth redeeme
                           With Humblenesse, and holds it greatest gayne,
                           Her Peace, not Place; true Loue, not Glorie to maintayne.
                        
                        
                           7
                           Most fruitfull Lady like the fertile Vine,
                           Which euermore when shee most fruit doth beare,
                           Her goodliest branches lowliest doth decline,
                           And as the fairest clusters doe appeare,
                           Hid vnder leaues; eu'n so this gracious Pee
                                 •
                              e

                           Of Fortunes stormes shee neuer stands in feare,
                           Nor troubled is with want or with distresse,
                           For shee hath learn'd to be content in paine or ease.
                        
                        
                           
                           8
                           Inward and outward's this Humilitie,
                           In words and actions, lookes, thoughts, and attire,
                           The inward by the outward we descrie.
                           It is hypocrisie for to desire
                           Lowly to seeme, and secretly aspire
                           Vnto a Crowne, by legs, with Absal
                                    •
                                 m:
                           
                           Such complement let Pagan Courts admire,
                           Neuer such basenesse yet had any roome
                           In Court of heau'nly Loue, where heart and looke is one.
                        
                        
                           9
                           For true Humilitie is vndiuided,
                           Shee alwayes lookes, speakes, does, seemes, thinks the same,
                           And though shee bee by scorners oft derided,
                           Shee's alwayes humble like vnto her name:
                           Nor doth shee vertuous deeds to purchase fame,
                           But for themselues, and for her Lords deare sake,
                           Who with her suffred much reproch and shame,
                           When he a Seruants forme did on him take,
                           And Lord of all, himselfe of none account did make.
                        
                        
                           10
                           The Sonne of God from all eternitie,
                           Most holy, happy, wise, whose glorious Station
                           Being pight in Heau'n, thought it no robberie
                           To be with God of equall estimation;
                           Himselfe to make here of no reputation,
                           His glorie great in highest Heau'ns to leaue,
                           And liue here in the meanest seruants fashion,
                           And when the Heau'ns did him againe receaue,
                           Her here vnto his Spouse for an ensample leaue.
                        
                        
                           11
                           Oh! could we but this wondrous Grace conceaue,
                           And honour Loue hath done Humilitie,
                           Would it not cause vs vnto her to cleaue,
                           And her embrace with all integritie,
                           Keeping her in our hearts most carefully,
                           That from our humbled hearts, as from a Well,
                           There might flow forth vnfayn'd humilitie,
                           That when we are hence summon'd by the bell,
                           We in Loues Court with ioy eternally may dwell?
                        
                        
                           
                           12
                           This is the finall cause of Humblenesse,
                           To gaine true Blisse, and Gods eternall Loue:
                           The formall is vnfayned Lowlinesse,
                           In and without, which God and Man approue;
                           The knowledge of our selues vs well may moue
                           As the efficient cause, her to embrace:
                           Thoughts, manners, lookes, words, tires materiall proue;
                           For by the words, eye, act, attire and face,
                           A wise man may discerne what in the heart hath place.
                        
                        
                           13
                           But now if we vnto th'effects proceede,
                           What gaynes a man by all his lowlinesse?
                           Wee see what mickle sorrow it did breede
                           Vnto our Captayne, when in great distresse
                           Hee's humbled to the Crosse: and we no lesse
                           By his ensample looke to vnder-goe
                           His scoffes and scornes, his gall and bitternesse:
                           If this be all Humilitie can doe,
                           Of all they are most wretched that are humbled so.
                        
                        
                           14
                           But loe! our Leader that did her embrace
                           With such affection, God doth him regard
                           As his deare Sonne: behold, he doth him grace
                           Aboue the Angels; and he hath prepar'd
                           Such ioyes for him as cannot be compar'd:
                           With glorie and with honour hath him crown'd,
                           And though a while on earth he meanely far'd,
                           All now vnto his honour doth redound,
                           At naming of his Name all knees must kisse the ground.
                        
                        
                           15
                           And vs that in our Captaynes steps doe treade,
                           And follow him in true Humilitie,
                           He will to endlesse blisse and glorie leade,
                           And honour here with true nobilitie:
                           And as he captiue led captiuitie,
                           And did from lowest earth to heau'n ascend,
                           So from the dust and graue shall we on high
                           Be rais'd, where we in glorie shall transcend
                           The Angels: which on Head and Members must attend.
                        
                        
                           
                           16
                           But soft, my Muse, thou now dost farre transcend
                           The subiect of thy song, Humilitie,
                           Now homeward to thy selfe thy thoughts intend,
                           And view the subiect where shee doth aby.
                           The heart's the seate of true Humilitie,
                           And in thy body seated is thine heart,
                           Both made of basest Clay: thy soule from high,
                           The highest by thy nostrils did impart,
                           Which is there all in all, and all in eu'ry part.
                        
                        
                           17
                           The bodi's base; the soule it doth transcend,
                           And were't not here immur'd in house of clay,
                           Against her nature shee would re-ascend
                           To him that gaue her: Then, my Soule, I say,
                           Into her Makers presence would away,
                           And be accepted by his mediation,
                           Who humbled to the Crosse, for her did pay
                           His dearest blood for reconciliation.
                           For after humblenesse doth follow exaltation.
                        
                        
                           18
                           Nay eu'n our flesh, though humbled in the dust,
                           By vertue of our Sauiours Resurrection,
                           Againe shall be vnited: and the iust
                           Which haue beene humbled here by his direction,
                           Shall be deliuer'd from worlds base subiection,
                           Into the libertie and glorious light
                           Of Gods owne Sonnes, vnder whose safe protection,
                           They euer shall enioy the happy sight
                           Of God and's Saints, which here haue humbled beene aright.
                        
                        
                           19
                           But Humblenesse is not the onely way
                           To bring vs to this glorious exaltation,
                           End of our hopes: but first doth vs conuay
                           To wholesome true Repentance to saluation;
                           Which is from filthy sinne the best purgation:
                           Mercy the meeke and humble man doth saue,
                           Though Iustice vs condemne to dire damnation,
                           If Faith and Hope for vs we Patrons haue,
                           Whilst Bountie grants vs all things needfull we doe craue.
                        
                        
                           
                           20
                           The Treasurer Knowledge, who hath alwayes vow'd
                           Her selfe true seruant to Humilitie,
                           Hath her with precious and rare gifts endow'd,
                           Yet still more meane and lowly shee will bee:
                           For well shee wots, in whom the Treasuree
                           Of Wisedome and of Knowledge all did dwell,
                           Became a seruant meane of low degree,
                           Truth often vnto her (what shee knowes well)
                           That shee hath nought but what shee hath receau'd, doth tell.
                        
                        
                           21
                           Thus Meeknesse, Patience, true Obedience, Ioy,
                           Doe alwayes with Humilitie abide,
                           Shee is most kind and curteous, neuer coy
                           Vnto the vertuous; and shee opens wide
                           Loues gate vnto the Humble; but doth hide
                           From th'enuious, vaine, and the ambitious wight,
                           Truth, Prudence, Knowledge, which should be their guide;
                           Thus Humblenesse guides all to Truth and light,
                           But Pride, Ambition, leade to darknesse, errour, night.

                           23
                           Oh! had Humilitie true Knowledge brought
                           To Eue, before shee did commit this sinne!
                           Shee ne're had entertayn'd so base a thought,
                           Nor we of Pride and Satan bond-slaues bin;
                           See here the end of all, that doe begin
                           In pride and in ambition: they must fall,
                           Pride first betray'd vs to the Fowlers gin,
                           But Humblenesse deliuers them from thrall,
                           That doe vnfeignedly with her for mercy call.

                           What? Be as gods? For to be proud and poore,
                           Is a base sinne, hated of God and Man,
                           Behold, eu'n as Humility's the doore,
                           That leades to Happinesse, eu'n so began
                           At Pride the miserie and smart of Man:
                           Which still in him remaynes a dangerous sore.
                           For honour here a Worldling what you can,
                           His greedie thoughts will neuer count it store,
                           Ambition, like to Hell and Graue, still gapes for more.
                        
                        
                           25
                           Thus Poets tell of an ambitious Snaile,
                           That golden weather-cocke on steeple high
                           Espying, from sweet Garden, would assaile,
                           And for vaine glorie life would ieopardie:
                           He by fast hold and winding subtiltie,
                           Mounts slily vp the steeples highest spire,
                           Whence he the poore Bird throwes downe cruelly,
                           And doth to his place vaine-gloriously aspire,
                           Till Boreas brasen wings him throwes downe in the mire.
                        
                        
                           26
                           Thus vaine fond youth left his sage Fathers lore,
                           And by his borrowed wings did soare so high,
                           (Loe here their end that seeke so high to soare)
                           The Sunne beames heate his waxen wings did frie.
                           Proud Bryar that safe and secure did lie
                           Vnder stout Oakes most safe protecting armes,
                           Supplanted him by treason cunningly,
                           Then to Sunnes heate expos'd and Winters stormes,
                           He's trod downe by wild beasts, and eaten vp of wormes.
                        
                        
                           27
                           Once had the feete the noble Head defide,
                           Grieuing to beare his burthen any more,
                           And Brawny armes their helping hands denide,
                           To feede the belly with conuenient store:
                           But hands and armes forthwith grew weake and poore
                           For want of stomacks strength'ning nourishment,
                           And now the legs that able were before,
                           To beare both Head and Bodies wonderment,
                           Became wrang, stumbling, lame for want of gouernment.

                           Next Fig-tree sweet to rule they would constraine,
                           Who nould his sweetnesse leaue for Kingdomes glee:
                           Last to the fertile Vine they doe complaine,
                           Who fruitfulnesse loues more than Sou'raigntee,

                           Those that in Princes seruice purchase fame,
                           And thereby would raise their posteritie,
                           Seeke great allyance to confirme the same,
                           And of the Heralds get a Pedigree:
                           But they that would gaine true nobilitie,
                           To doe Christ's heau'nly Fathers will must seeke,

                           Of Vertues all into one building brought,
                           Which for to raise on high by contemplation,
                           Must deepe and low within the ground be wrought:
                           If one desire to mount his house aloft,
                           And workes his vnder-pinning slight below,
                           He builds vpon the sands: all comes to nought,
                           For if the floods doe come or wind doe blow,
                           Affliction, Persecution, all doth ouerthrow.

                           Hath her denomination from the ground:
                           For though, as shee is spirituall, shee can flie
                           Aboue the highest heau'ns, yet shee is found
                           The lowliest wight on earth, though highly to be crown'd.

                           By deriuation from Humilitie,
                           To teach him that he should become the same
                           In Truth, as in names Etymologie;

                           But this in me the Flesh, not Spirit doth deuise.

                           For shee hath learn'd, that not from East or West
                           Promotion comes, The higher one is plac't
                           The greater cares and troubles him infest,
                           And as thou more or greater Talents hast,
                           The more thou art to count for at the last.
                           Thou art a Steward here: 'Tis not thine owne,
                           But as thee 'boue thy fellowes God hath grac't,
                           So must thy Faith and care 'boue theirs be showne,
                           We doe expect best Crops whereas best Seede is sowne.
                        
                        
                           50
                           These things, ô God! I aske, doe not denie,
                           Let me depend vpon thy Prouidence
                           In paine and ease, losse and prosperitie,
                           My selfe submit with all obedience
                           Vnto thy Will: performe with diligence
                           Charge publique, priuate: Let Humilitie
                           Be vnto me a Rocke of sure defence,
                           Against Mens malice, and Worlds iniurie,
                           And where my weaknesse failes, let thy good Grace supply.
                        
                        
                           51
                           Oh thou, that Lazarus from Diues gate,
                           Didst into Abrams blessed bosome raise,
                           There to enioy eternall happy state,
                           That here, on earth, was humbled all his dayes;
                           Direct mine humble heart in all thy wayes,
                           The meeke, in iudgement, thou delight'st to guide,
                           Turne all I doe vnto thy glorious praise,
                           Preserue me from Ambition, Enuie, Pride,
                           And though with Lazar's sores, in thy Loue let me bide.
                        
                        
                           
                           52
                           Thou hast, ô Lord! proclaymed Blessednesse
                           To all the meeke in Heart and poore in Spirit:
                           Blest are the Meeke, they shall the earth possesse,
                           The Poore eu'n now Gods Kingdome doe inherit.
                           Lord! I acknowledge freely my demerit,
                           It is thy Grace whereby I am, liue, moue,
                           Thy humbling to the Crosse, for me, did merit,
                           That I should be exalted to thy Loue,
                           And liue with thee in blisse eternally aboue.
                        
                        
                           53
                           I aske that which thy blessed Martyrs had,
                           Which here haue witness'd their Humilitie,
                           And of that cup of gall to taste were glad,
                           Which first their Master swallow'd willingly,
                           Thy Grace, ô Lord! which thou wilt not denie,
                           For they haue found it all-sufficient,
                           Humble me how thou wilt: Abilitie
                           Yet grant in sorrow to be patient,
                           And strength with Paul, in paine or ease, to be content,
                        
                        
                           54
                           Grant me thy Grace, but to conceaue the end
                           And certayne fruits of my humiliation,
                           Then shall I plainely see and apprehend,
                           That it prepares me fit for exaltation;
                           And to make sure with feare mine owne saluation,
                           Whereby I may stand firme and confident
                           'Gainst wicked Men, Hell, Deuils, and damnation,
                           Who neuer shall be able to preuent
                           Thy loue in Christ, which thou on humble men hast bent.
                        
                        
                           55
                           Now for that thing which worldlings doe deplore,
                           I yeeld to thee most heartie laud and praise,
                           That thou art pleas'd to humble me therefore,
                           On earth, that thou againe to heau'n might'st raise,
                           Oh teach me, Lord, to number so my dayes,
                           That I my life may labour to amend,
                           Oh, teach me lowlinesse in all my wayes,
                           To thinke of my beginning and mine end.
                           Prince, Beggar, borne alike, and to their graue descend.
                        
                        
                           
                           56
                           And since that sweet Humilities condition
                           I haue so learned by this Meditation,
                           That now I hate Pride, Enuie, and Ambition,
                           With complements base subtile machination:
                           Grant me to follow Christs humiliation,
                           Who from the Crosse to Glorie did ascend,
                           Whose suffrings make a reconciliation
                           For those, that by true Faith him apprehend,
                           And after him in lowlinesse and meeknesse wend.
                        
                        
                           57
                           You may remember how I earst you told,
                           That when Humilitie had clear'd the score,
                           Whereby t'ambitious Pride my heart was sold,
                           Shee led me to Repentance: who before
                           The chiefe Iudge Iustice brought, and my foule sore
                           Discouer'd to my more humiliation,
                           Till Faith and Hope at Mercies seate therefore
                           Did pleade Christs Blood my reconciliation.
                           But this I leaue vnto another Meditation.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        MEDITAT. III.
                        Of Repentance.
                        
                           1
                           
                              THe Highest that created first of nought
                           A Chaos vast, and out thereof did take
                           The Earth, whereof he noblest Creature wrought,
                           Eu'n Man, and made all Creatures for his sake,
                           Him first pure, iust, and righteous did make,
                           But since, their owne inuentions they obay,
                           And in a right path set, their way mistake,
                           And as blind; fooles and slaues haue gone astray,
                           Nor can, without the true Light, find againe the way.
                        
                        
                           2
                           For whilst they doe yet in their sinnes remaine,
                           Their Soules in errour and in darknesse bide,
                           They know not how they should be borne againe,
                           For Sinne this mysterie from them doth hide;
                           And till Humilitie their trustie Guide,
                           Shall them to wholesome true Repentance leade,
                           They misse their ayme, and striuing stray more wide;
                           Repentance quickneth men in sinne cleane dead,
                           And teacheth new-borne Babes in path of Life to tread.
                        
                        
                           3
                           Shee is the Mid-wife, that with keenest knife
                           Our Nauell cuts, whereby we cleaue to sinne,
                           Who though shee cruell seeme, yet giues sweet life,
                           When first to liue in Spirit we begin;
                           Shee, vs polluted and defil'd within,
                           Doth clense in Fountayne of Regeneration;
                           Vs new-borne Babes, shee teacheth to let in
                           The milke sincere to sure Iustification;
                           Till stronger meate make strong our Faith to sure Saluation.
                        
                        
                           
                           4
                           And though in chaine of Gods most f
                                 ••
                              me Decree,
                           First sauing linke is his Predestination,
                           Election next, then Calling, yet wee see
                           No certayne pledges here of our Saluation,
                           Till true Repentance workes Humiliation:
                           Loe! then we doe, by right degrees, proceede
                           Vnto the highest linke, Glorification;
                           So that Repentance first to vs doth reede,
                           What is eternally in Heau'n by God decreed.
                        
                        
                           5
                           Thou, that dost Hearts with true Repentance season,
                           Making them view their owne vile wretchednesse,
                           That cast downe with Apostasie and Treason,
                           We may of thee seeke endlesse Happinesse;
                           First grant me true Repentance: next to expresse
                           What sou'raine Vertues I in her haue found.
                           And though at first my soule with bitternesse
                           Were ouerwhelm'd; yet Grace did cure that wound:
                           So where most sinne there is, Mercy doth most abound.
                        
                        
                           6
                           Repentance is a holy worke of Grace,
                           From godly Sorrow: by which Man from sin
                           Is turn'd: Gods promises in Christ t'embrace,
                           And Fruits fit for Repentance to begin:
                           Repentance is Gods holy worke within,
                           To worke our Righteousnesse, and Sinne deface,
                           And no Man can be exercis'd therein,
                           But he that standeth in the state of Grace;
                           For no Man turnes to God, till God him first embrace.
                        
                        
                           7
                           Grace and Repentance are in time conioyn'd,
                           As Fire and Heate: but as Heate first appeares
                           To vs, when Fire in Embers is confin'd,
                           Eu'n so when sparkes of Grace our Heart first cheares,
                           Repentance manifests her selfe by teares.
                           Grace is the sap in heau'nly vegetation,
                           Repentance is the prime bud, which it beares,
                           The first sure signe of true Regeneration,
                           Then follow leaues, flow'rs, fruits, as certayne demonstration.
                        
                        
                           
                           8
                           This godly Sorrow differs from the care
                           And griefe a worldling in his heart receaues,
                           By sense of Gods iust wrath or great Mens feare,
                           Or ought that their good names or goods bereaues.
                           This godly Sorrow griefe of mind conceaues,
                           That he hath sinn'd, and that he did displease
                           So good and kind a God; which so close cleaues
                           To's heart, that though no feare did him disease,
                           Of Iudge, Hell, Deuill, yet nought but Grace can him appease.
                        
                        
                           9
                           Man was most faire, in Gods owne Image built,
                           Had with him sweet communion at's Creation,
                           Whereby in God, and God eke in him dwelt,
                           But sinne hath since enforc'd a separation,
                           And made vs sonnes of wrath by alienation;
                           Now we like prodigall and lost sheepe stray,
                           Till Grace and true Repentance restauration
                           Doth make of all, sinne doth in vs decay,
                           Then we returne, and our Creators hests obay.
                        
                        
                           10
                           But true Repentance doth repent of all,
                           And not of many or one onely sinne:
                           
                              Herod conuerted thus at Baptists call,
                           Him gladly heard, and hearing did begin
                           For to doe many things: but would not lin
                           The sinne of incest with his brothers Loue;
                           Some, like th'Adulterer, doe turne from sinne,
                           When they want strength: from bad to worse some moue,
                           As when the prodigall a couetous man doth proue.
                        
                        
                           11
                           Shee hath two hands, with one, loe! shee beginnes
                           To presse vs downe to true mortification,
                           Whereby we may returne from all our sinnes;
                           Vs th'other rayseth by Regeneration
                           To a new life, and to Sanctification.
                           One from all actuall sinnes makes vs abstayne,
                           Suppresseth, weakens, natures deprauation;
                           Makes the Mind purpose, and the Will full fayne,
                           And all our whole indeauours from sinne to refrayne.
                        
                        
                           
                           12
                           The other hand Mans purged mind doth raise
                           Vnto a serious firme deliberation,
                           To yeeld sincere obedience to Gods Sayes,
                           And worketh in the will an inclination
                           Him to obey, as at our first creation.
                           This doth Mans life and best indeauours frame,
                           To walke here in a holy conuersation,
                           Though all, we doe, vnperfect is and lame,
                           Yet if the Heart be right, God will accept the same.
                        
                        
                           13
                           And as shee hath a double energie,
                           Men head-long to th'infernall Pit to throw,
                           And them againe by Faith to viuifie:
                           So though of this great worke, one cause we know,
                           Gods Spirit, that whereas it list doth blow;
                           Yet vseth it a twofold instrument,
                           The Law, which Death to vs for sinne doth show:
                           The Gospell, that doth preach attonement;
                           Thus both the Law and Gospell teach vs to repent.
                        
                        
                           14
                           The Law first pierceth eu'n the very heart,
                           And doth by little and degrees proceede;
                           Till Knowledge foure things needfull doth impart,
                           Gods Law; the guilt of Sinne; and Sinnes iust meede,
                           Which is eternall Fire by God decreed:
                           Then we these rightly to our selues apply,
                           Which doth in vs a feare and horrour breed,
                           Except on Gospels comfort we rely;
                           For without that we die in hell eternally.
                        
                        
                           15
                           Then doth the Gospell make vs comprehend
                           Gods mercy, for it seriously enquire,
                           And by the gifts of Knowledge to contend,
                           That though I iustly haue deseru'd Gods ire,
                           If I my selfe denie yet, and desire
                           My trust in Christs sole merits to repose,
                           I shall thereby escape eternall Fire:
                           Thus doth Repentance griefe and ioy impose,
                           Griefe for my sinnes: but Ioy, God doth me from them loose.
                        
                        
                           
                           16
                           Thus godly Sorrow in our heart being wrought,
                           Which brings Repentance with true change of mind,
                           We are resolu'd neuer in word, deed, thought,
                           So to offend God in our wonted kind,
                           But a new life to leade; loe, then we find
                           Within our selues a wondrous alteration,
                           Not that it changeth substance of our mind,
                           Or body, in the matter or the fashion,
                           But doth reforme their powers as in their first creation.
                        
                        
                           17
                           Shee worldly griefe to godly sorrow turnes,
                           Our Wrath and Anger into temp'rate Zeale,
                           Presumption into Faith, their heart that burnes
                           In wanton loue, to heau'nly Loue appeale:
                           Mad laughter shee with Christian ioy doth seale,
                           Mildnesse of nature turnes to spirits meeknesse,
                           Soules faculties doth all repaire and heale,
                           And brings them vnto their first perfectnesse:
                           Thus shee makes crocked streight, and what's wrong doth redresse.
                        
                        
                           18
                           Then bring we forth fruits worthy amendment
                           Of life; the truth whereof we doe expresse,
                           When, by good workes, we shew how we repent,
                           Repenting soules be Trees of Righteousnesse,
                           Planted by God which Riuers doe refresh,
                           Eu'n flouds that from the Sanctuarie flow,
                           Whose boughes doe lowly stoope with fruitfulnesse:
                           There fruits for meate; leaues good for medicine grow,
                           Else to the roote the Axe is laid them downe to throw.
                        
                        
                           19
                           Repentance Subiect is a grieued heart,
                           A conscience wounded with the sight of Sinne,
                           Which nought but hell and horrour doth impart,
                           When to lay open conscience doth beginne
                           Our sinnes without, and wicked thoughts within:
                           And 'lesse shee to vs hope in Christ reueale,
                           We may with Iudas hang vp by the chin,
                           But like a skilfull Surgeon shee doth deale,
                           First corrasiue the sore, and then it gently heale.
                        
                        
                           
                           20
                           Shee hath a double Obiect, guilt of sinne,
                           And sinnes iust meede, eternall condemnation,
                           Which terror breedes without, horror within;
                           The second is our Sauiours blessed Passion,
                           Made eu'n our owne by a right application:
                           This brings true inward ioy and sound delight,
                           And doth deface th'hand-writing of damnation,
                           This brings vs out of darknesse into light,
                           This Sunne of Righteousnesse doth chase away our night.
                        
                        
                           21
                           As Pharaoh with his Butler and his Baker,
                           So deales shee with the wicked and the iust,
                           They both alike offended haue their Maker,
                           And both alike into one Dungeon thrust:
                           But, loe, shee lifts to place of highest trust
                           The Butler, but the Baker doth forsake,
                           And leaues him to the meede of the vniust:
                           Thus, with her left hand, shee vs drownes in Lake,
                           But with her right vs into endlesse ioy doth take.
                        
                        
                           22
                           Neare to her fellowes, gracious Restitution,
                           A Lady of a conscience wondrous tender;
                           That of all benefits makes retribution,
                           And for a wrong done, double mends will render;
                           Sorrow, Teares, Kindnesse, Bountie, doe attend her,
                           Sighs, Prayer, true Deuotion on her wait,
                           If shee wants these Associates, God amend her,
                           Shee's but Hypocrisie, the Deuils bait,
                           To catch poore soules with false pretences and deceit.
                        
                        
                           23
                           For, loe, two Hags of hell would like her seeme:
                           One outward is and ceremoniall,
                           Which like proud Pharisee her selfe doth deeme
                           Aboue the Publican: And shee will fall
                           To prayer on her knees amongst them all:
                           The other eu'n my pen trembles to write,
                           Mine heart to thinke of: her, Despaire we call,
                           Oh! shee our Sauiours suffrings doth despite,
                           Counting His satisfaction, for her sinnes, too light.
                        
                        
                           
                           24
                           Many there be that will repent of

                              ,
                           When they are scourged by th'Almighties hand,
                           But when to spare his rod he doth beginne,
                           They stay repenting, and themselues doe band
                           Against the Righteous: And though God command,
                           They will resist him like proud Egypts King,
                           Which notwithstanding ten Plagues did withstand
                           His Makers will, his Heart still hardening,
                           Till on himselfe and people he confusion bring.

                           A cursed sinne's finall impenitence,
                           When as a man himselfe so iust doth take,
                           As he needs not repent for his offence:
                           This like a lethargie our soule doth make
                           Vnsensible of sinne, till we awake:
                           And as 'tis a disease most dangerous,
                           Which vs insensible thereof doth make,
                           So of all States it is most perilous,
                           To be dead-sicke of sinne, yet thinke we are righteous.

                           The Spirit first lights; Hell doth like thunder prease,
                           Then sorrowes, clouds, teares, showers make inundation:
                           Lastly, like Sunne shines ioy, which seales vp our saluation.

                           Of nought created Aire, Fire, Firmament,
                           With all the Spirits and Powers that are aboue,

                           All these he made for Man; Man him to serue and loue.

                           Wherefore He him in goodliest Garden plac't,
                           And one Fruit onely did from him defend,
                           Of which Fruit onely he presum'd to taste,
                           Wherefore God him for eu'r out of the Garden cast.

                           Was the sole-mouing cause Man first to make;
                           So gracelesse Man he leaues not in this case,
                           But to repaire his losse, will vndertake
                           A new worke likewise for his mercies sake:
                           To free him from sinnes guilt, and Satans wile.
                           God will Mans flesh and guilt vpon him take,
                           And purge him from the sinne doth him defile,
                           Thus Satan is beguil'd, that sought Man to beguile.

                           For without Faith our Prayers are in vaine,

                           On which God fire and brimstone downe did raine.
                           The first is Pharisaicall, ouer-iust:
                           The other doth Gods promises distrust.
                           But Faith, like little Zoar Lot doth saue,

                           But neuer Gods great goodnesse vnderstands,

                           From pleading, till our Pardon shee hath wrought:

                           Faith, like to Moses, out of Egypt leades
                           All Israelites that vnder bondage grone,
                           Baptiseth them that in her foote-steps treades,
                           As in red Sea: Faith cleaues aHeart. Rocke of stone,

                           The hidden Manna makes from heau'n descend,
                           Which who by Faith eate, Bone become of Bone,
                           Flesh of his Flesh: Faith doth before vs wend
                           Through this worlds wildernesse: but there she makes an end.

                           By force or sleight his life for to surprize:
                           Eu'n so, good Lord, grant thou me grace to doe,
                           That though sleepe often close my bodies eyes,
                           My Soule may still keepe watch 'gainst Satans subtilties.

                           Hope was the Patron that with Faith did ioyne,
                           When to my triall me Repentance brought,
                           Who all their might and forces did combine,
                           Vntill my absolution they had wrought:
                           These not their owne good, but their Clients sought,
                           And pleaded not for friendship, fees, or gayne;
                           Loues fauour was their vtmost ayme and thought,
                           They shew'd no Law their Causes to maintayne:
                           But Pardons wrote in's Blood that for our sinnes was slayne.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        MEDITAT. V.
                        Of Hope.
                        
                           1
                           
                              REpentance, Faith, and Hope be graces three,
                           Which no where but in Israel are knowne:
                           Of other Vertues some resemblance wee
                           Do find amongst the Heathen: which are showne
                           To them by Natures light, and first were sowne
                           Most pure, till they corrupted were with sin,
                           But now they most vnlike themselues are growne,
                           For till Faith, Hope them to restore begin,
                           They glorious seeme without, but foule and vile within.
                        
                        
                           2
                           For though of Knowledge, Loue, Truth, Patience,
                           Right, Mercy, Fortitude, Humilitie,
                           Prudence, Zeale, Temp'rance, Bountie, Obedience,
                           There doe in them remayne some memorie;
                           Yet wanting Faith and Hope, like either eye,
                           Their blinded soules for to direct aright,
                           In all their actions they doe moue awry,
                           For Faith and Hope like Sunne and Moones cleare light,
                           Direct repenting Soules which wander else in night.
                        
                        
                           3
                           And though by reading in Dame Natures booke
                           The Heau'n and Earth's most wonderfull creation,
                           They vpwards to their Maker oft did looke,
                           And saw his Power and Wisedomes manifestation,
                           And their owne wretchednesse: Yet Humiliation
                           For sinne, in them no true Repentance wrought:
                           For missing these chiefe Agents of saluation,
                           The worke could not be to perfection brought;
                           For without Faith and Hope, Repentance profits nought.
                        
                        
                           
                           4
                           Thou that the Finisher and Authour art
                           Of eu'ry good and perfect Gift and Grace,
                           Who look'st not on the worke, but on the heart,
                           Where eu'ry Vertue holds her seate and place,
                           Who lately hast me guided in the trace
                           Of Faith the Mother: now direct aright
                           My Muse, to follow on the Vertues chase,
                           And first of Hope Faiths daughter next in sight:
                           And make my Hope stand stedfast whilst of Hope I write.
                        
                        
                           5
                           Hope is of things to come an expectation,
                           Which God hath promis'd, and Faith doth beleeue,
                           For when th'Elect of their Iustification
                           By Faith, stand sure: Then Hope doth them releeue
                           With Patience, to expect till God doth giue
                           All the good things which he hath promised,
                           So that no crosse affliction can them grieue,
                           For by this Hope they stand assured,
                           The day will come their Hope shall be accomplished.
                        
                        
                           6
                           Some, Faith Hopes Mother, some her Sister call,
                           Howsoe're, betwixt them is so neare relation,
                           That if one faile, the other needes must fall;
                           Faith brings forth Hope, the Anchor of saluation,
                           But Faith is nourished by expectation,
                           A thankfull Daughter to a blessed Dame,
                           Who nonrisheth her Mother in this fashion,
                           And oft when Faith growes cold, blind, faint, and lame;
                           Hopes brests, Assurance, Patience, her restore againe.
                        
                        
                           7
                           A blessed paire, like Na

                                 mi and Ruth,
                           
                           Faith doth direct, and Hope goes forth to gleane,
                           Faith searcheth first, beleeues, and finds the Truth,
                           Then Hope at Booz feete expects the meane:
                           And though at first a small reward shee gayne,
                           Yet being content Gods leisure for to stay,
                           Shee in the end doth to her Hope attayne;
                           
                              Ruth 
                              
                                 •
                              nto Booz married is that day,
                           And now may Naomi in her lap Obed lay.
                        
                        
                           
                           8
                           Hope is so like Faith, and so neare of Kin,
                           As hardly we discerne a difference;
                           Faith is the ground whereon Hope doth begin;
                           Both haue alike assurance, Patience:
                           From the same Spirit both haue their influence,
                           Both sauing Graces purge and purifie
                           The heart, and season with obedience:
                           Both last alike: By both we'our selues denie;
                           Both make our conscience sound: By both for Christ we die.
                        
                        
                           9
                           But Faith is first, for loe, shee is Hopes ground,
                           Hope onely future sees, but Faith things past:
                           Faith seales our euidence and makes it sound,
                           Hope waites till shee possession take at last:
                           Hope is the Helmet that on th'Head is plac't,
                           But Faith the Shield doth all the body hide,
                           And though our Faith oft faint, our Hope stands fast,
                           From off the Shield full many a blow may slide
                           On Helmet: but there farther entrance is deni'de.
                        
                        
                           10
                           Thus haue I shew'd how they are different.
                           The cause now: As of Words immortall seede
                           The Spirit begets Faith, to giue firme assent
                           Vnto Gods Promises: Eu'n, so indeede,
                           That Spirit out of those Promises doth breede
                           A liuely Hope: whose end is our saluation,
                           And that we shall haue all things which we neede;
                           In the meane time, we haue our conuersation
                           By Faith and Hope with Christ, in heau'nly habitation.
                        
                        
                           11
                           Similitudes make plaine and illustrate
                           Things, that are else mysterious, darke, obscure:
                           As when th'immortall Workman did create
                           At first, Man without helpe, alone and pure,
                           He made him then a deepe sleepe to endure,
                           And tooke stuffe from him ere he did awake,
                           Of which he made for him a helpe most sure.
                           So the same Spirit that Faith at first did make,
                           To make now Hope, Faiths help, doth matter from Faith take.
                        
                        
                           
                           12
                           As Body, Spirit, Faith, Lord and Baptisme's one,
                           So but one true and liuing Hope we find:
                           But as her Obiects infinite become,
                           We may distinguish her in different kind.
                           If heau'nly Obiects be to her assign'd,
                           Shee like the Obiect is, Celestiall,
                           If shee on worldly Obiects set her mind,
                           As doth the Obiect, shee doth rise or fall,
                           Loe then, the Obiect of our Hope is all in all.
                        
                        
                           13
                           We hope for that for vs in Heau'n's vp laid,
                           We hope to see Christs glorious Exaltation,
                           We hope for all things, that Christ for vs praid,
                           We hope in Gospell that brings vs saluation,
                           We hope of all in Christ a restauration;
                           We hope Soules, Bodies, shall immortall liue:
                           We hope to reape what's sowne in expectation,
                           The faithfull Pastor hopes his Flocke shall thriue,
                           Faith Author is of Hope, but Hope keepes Faith aliue.
                        
                        
                           14
                           When Faith beleeues, Hope hopes gainst Sense and Reason.
                           Gods Promise is her soundest Argument,
                           His leisure to attend, is her best season,
                           Though Faith beleeue 'boue Hope yet shee's content
                           To hope: Present to her are things absent:
                           Shee neuer faints, but holds out to the end,
                           Shee to encrease and grow is diligent,
                           Shee's pure and cleane: No shame doth her attend,
                           By Patience and Experience shee doth daily mend.
                        
                        
                           15
                           Faith's like Elias that by God was sent,
                           
                              Elisha to anoint him to succeede:
                           Hope, like Elisha, waits most diligent,
                           And leaues her not, till fiery Charets leade
                           Faith vp to Heau'n: Then Hope stayes in her stead;
                           Loe then, Faiths Spirit on Hope is doubled found,
                           And though by Faith our Soules on Heau'n now feede,
                           Hope still sustaynes our Bodies on the ground,
                           And waits till all that Faith beleeues, shee true haue found.
                        
                        
                           
                           16
                           Yea after that our bodies turne to dust,
                           It seemes that Hope still with our soules remaine:
                           What else doth meane theReuel. 6. 10. 11. crying of the Iust,

                           They should rest, till the number was fulfilled
                           Of those which for the Word, as they were, should be killed.

                           Hope's subiect is each heart, that Christ hath knowne,
                           And where in glorie he vouchsafes to dwell,
                           Shee best by Obiects is conceau'd and showne,
                           For as they doe transcend, Hope doth excell:
                           All Gods good Promises which one can tell,
                           Her Obiects are, which if one right would reade,
                           He must begin with that when Adam fell,
                           Gods Promise to the Woman, that her seede,
                           Though Serpent bruis'd his heele, should breake the Serpents head.
                        
                        
                           18
                           Like this, was that promise to Abraham,
                           
                           All Nations should be blessed in his seede:
                           And him that King of Israel became
                           God promis'd, one should ne're want of his breede,
                           To sway great Iuda's Scepter in his stead,
                           Till Shilo came, who was his Lord and Sonne:
                           Sonne, as his flesh did from his Loynes proceede,
                           Lord as the God-head in the flesh did won,
                           Thus he was Dauids Christ, Sonne, Lord, and yet but one.
                        
                        
                           19
                           Loe, God perform'd all his good Promises
                           In Christ his sufferings, birth, and exaltation,
                           All tending to bring wretched Man to blisse;
                           But now, behold, new tidings of saluation,
                           The Gospell shewes, our reconciliation
                           Is finished: as after shall be showne,
                           When all in Heau'n and Earth haue restauration:
                           What we beleeue and hope, shall then be knowne,
                           Hope then shall reape in ioy, what shee in teares hath sowne.

                           Eu'n so all those that in the Gospell are,
                           In's second comming shall be finished:
                           And since that Good to Adam promised,
                           Was full foure thousand yeares ere consummation;
                           Why then should Hope that's thus experienced,
                           Faint in lesse then two thousands expectation?
                           Nearer, than when we first beleeu'd, is our saluation.
                        
                        
                           21
                           Oh! had I here Hopes wondrous memorie,
                           Then should I able be soone to make knowne,
                           All's Promises which God cannot denie,
                           Eu'ry of which Hope doth account her owne.
                           Behold, in briefe, them all vnto thee showne,
                           All Faith beleeues, (And what doth he distrust?
                           In whom this little seede of Faith is sowne)
                           All these, I say, Hope doth together thrust,
                           And in them puts assured confidence and trust.
                        
                        
                           22

                           For as the heate all coldnesse doth expell,
                           So Hope all doubting out of vs doth beate.
                           I grant, that as in luke-warme Water dwell
                           Both heate and cold, so in the hollow Cell
                           Of vnsound, luke-warme Libertines false mind,

                           None wrong her more than her familiar Friends,
                           As Merits, Doubtings, false Securitie

                           Oh! who can point out all the subtilties
                           Satan doth vse this Lady to depose;

                           That shee may in them confidence repose;
                           And thereby may her heau'nly Obiect lose?
                           Who are more miserable, Satan sayes,
                           Than those on things to come their Hopes repose?

                           But Angels as Companions him attend,
                           And eu'n with God he wrestles hand to hand,
                           Who doth from churlish Laban him defend,
                           Nor suffers cruell Esau Iacob to offend.

                           So when our Hope, alas, is faint and poore,
                           It forward walkes most free from all tentation:
                           But when it gets some strength, Despaire before,

                           Hope signifies a constant expectation
                           Of some good thing to come, from such a one

                           It is no Hope to hope for things we see:

                           Last of all, those which we within our selues doe find.

                           To Hope, which I in Faiths discourse haue nam'd,

                           For if one faints, the other lends her helping hand.

                           Of all that had their heads in this most hellish motion.

                           Of Romes foule Beast, for aide flyes to our Land,
                           Where Prince, Priests, People ioyne together all,
                           In the defence of Faith and Hope to stand,
                           And in their quarrell spend their liues, their goods and land.
                        
                        
                           
                           52
                           Here both haue dwelt safe neare a hundred yeare,
                           Since they from Rome were banisht to this Land;
                           Where many Saints haue lost their bloods most deare,
                           Whilst constantly in their defence they stand,
                           And though, for neare sixe yeares, Romes cruell hand
                           Did in this Land true Faith and Hope assaile;
                           Yet since Elizabeth did all command,
                           The Champions of true Faith did neuer faile,
                           But 'gainst close treason and force open did preuaile.
                        
                        
                           53
                           And though we lately lost the likeliest Prince
                           That euer liu'd, Faith and Hope to defend,
                           Yet loe, our Hope is more encreased since,
                           By Royall Charles, whom God doth seeme to send,
                           Like Charlemaine his Church secure to shend
                           'Gainst Antichrist, Hell, Schisme, and Saraceen:
                           And all from vs that would Hopes Anchre rend.
                           But here my Muse in order should begin▪
                           
                           To melt away in teares for losse of Anne our Queene.
                        
                        
                           54
                           Most peerelesse Lady! Nobles surest friend,
                           The Peoples safetie; Clergies firme defence,
                           Who constantly did Faith and Hope defend
                           'Gainst subtile Schisme and Papists virulence:
                           Church Patronesse 'gainst the violence
                           Of couetous Sacrilege and griping hands,
                           Who spoile Church-liuings vnder false pretence,
                           It 'gainst the thrift of true Deuotion stands;
                           That Churchmen should haue large possessions, goods, & lands.
                        
                        
                           55
                           But as when Death from Sonne and Father rent
                           A carefull Mother, and a faithfull Wife,
                           
                              Isaac Rebecka brought to Sara's Tent,
                           To comfort both the Sonnes and Fathers life,
                           So we doe hope, our Prince will take a Wife
                           Into his Mothers Tent, who shall begin
                           Like her to comfort Sonne and Fathers life.
                           But soft, my Muse, this thread too long doth spin,
                           Now will I sing of Hope that ought to be within.
                        
                        
                           
                           56
                           These presidents of Gods Grace, Faith, Truth, Loue,
                           Power, Wisedome, Prouidence, and dealing kind
                           With those that trust in him, vs well may moue
                           Vnto a stedfast Hope; which if we find
                           Within the secret Closet of our mind,
                           It is the earnest that to vs doth proue,
                           Here all things needfull shall be vs assign'd,
                           And we shall haue Hopes end, eu'n Heau'n aboue,
                           Where Faith and Hope shall leaue vs in the armes of Loue▪
                           
                        
                        
                           57
                           But Faith and Hope implicite generall,
                           Brings not to vs this blessed Habitation:
                           It must be inward, liuely, spirituall,
                           With true particular right application
                           Of all Christs merits, wrought for our saluation;
                           Else, with vntemper'd morter stones we lay,
                           And build vpon vnsound and weake foundation;
                           Fie on the Clerkes that so abuse the Lay,
                           (They vnderstand not what they hope, beleeue, or pray.)
                        
                        
                           58
                           Which thus would seale vp all in ignorance,
                           That they might seale their Pardons vnto all;
                           Thus they their state doe mightily aduance,
                           By binding or by loosing them that fall:
                           Mortall offences and sinnes veniall,
                           Differ not in their nature but their pay:
                           As sinnes abound, their Markets rise and fall,
                           So wide to Heau'n they open now the way,
                           That, loe, the richest men with most ease enter may.
                        
                        
                           59
                           The rellish and true taste of Faith and Hope,
                           They turne to ignorance and superstition:
                           Gods written Word that wont to be their scope,
                           Must now giue place to humane vaine Tradition:
                           Their inward Hope is honour, wealth, ambition,
                           And how they may all earthly Kingdomes sway,
                           Emp'rours and Kings to them must yeeld submission,
                           Else they their Subiects licence them to slay,
                           Thus Peters keyes, like swords, cut all out of their way.
                        
                        
                           
                           60
                           How doe these foule flagitious crying sinnes
                           Transport my Muse from holy Meditation,
                           Which erst in Hope aboue the Seraphins,
                           Tooke sweet delight in heau'nly Contemplation!
                           (Hath shee too long staid in this deuaition?)
                           Loe, now shee doth to Hope returne againe,
                           To heau'nly Hope, and glorious expectation,
                           Which firme and stedfast euer shall remayne,
                           Till her in Loues high Court her Sauiour entertayne.
                        
                        
                           61
                           See here, how graciously our God doth deale
                           With his, in sending them such enemies;
                           Else would Worlds vaine entising pleasures steale
                           Away our hearts to all impieties:
                           Such trialls doe the Vertues exercise,
                           Of all that set on God their confidence,
                           The greater ills that wicked men deuise,
                           The faster we doe cleaue to our defence:
                           So Hope becomes most firme by such experience.
                        
                        
                           62
                           And therefore I might better here complayne
                           Of too much Ease, Peace and Securitie,
                           Luke-warmenesse, hollow Dealing: these doe trayne
                           More soules to Hell, than Popes hostilitie.
                           Loe Satan not by force, but subtiltie,
                           Made our first Parents guiltie of transgression,
                           Whom Priests and Iesuites follow cunningly,
                           In plotting by auricular Confession,
                           Against States, Treason, and against poore Saints oppression
                                 •
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           63
                           O let me wish here more than I can hope,
                           All Enuie, Malice, Au'rice laid aside,
                           We would make Heau'n the Obiect of our Hope,
                           And Faith and Truth may euer be our Guide:
                           Thus from Gods Statutes we shall neuer slide,
                           Thus We, Pope, Sep'ratist shall meete in one:
                           Whom Truth doth ioyne, no Power can diuide,
                           Oh! why should Flesh of Flesh, and Bone of Bone
                           Differ? where God and Christ, Faith, Baptisme, Hope is one.
                        
                        
                           
                           64
                           Would our owne willing be, but to confesse
                           Their errour, and returne vnto the right,
                           Aband'ning wilfull, peeuish, singlenesse,
                           And censuring things whereof they haue no light,
                           Oh, would they striue with all their force and might.
                           To hold Spirits Vnitie in bond of Peace,
                           And not thus with indifferent things to fight;
                           Touch, taste not, handle not, which doe encrease
                           Schismes and Diuisions, which are Enemies to Peace.
                        
                        
                           65
                           So long and hot hath beene this feruent strife
                           For Apples, things of order, decencie,
                           That we, alas! neglect religious Life,
                           Faith, Hope, Repentance, Ioy and Charitie:
                           Of things indifferent iudge indifferently,
                           The smaller things, the greater consequence
                           There is, we should with all Humilitie
                           Yeeld vnto them vnfeign'd obedience:
                           Not we the Law: The Law must rule our Conscience.
                        
                        
                           66
                           Now could I, with Compassion, Prayers, Teares,
                           Beseech you all as to a common flame,
                           To lend your Hands, your Heads, your Hearts, your Eares,
                           And all your aide and helpe to quench the same:
                           'Tis to our Church a foule reproch and shame,
                           Christs Coate that is without Seame to diuide,
                           When we in substance all doe hold the same:
                           Lets humbly in one Hope, Faith, Loue abide,
                           And not fall out for shells, to make whose peace Christ di'de.
                        
                        
                           67
                           But they say Ceremonies now are dead,
                           Why should we them againe then viuifie?
                           I grant all were in Christ accomplished,
                           Which his last Sacrifice did typifie:
                           But those of Order and of Decencie,
                           Doe for our imitation still remayne,
                           As Ephods, Offrings, Tithes, Prayers, Prophecie,
                           Kneeling: such as Deuotion true maintayne,
                           The first we doe forbeare: The last we doe retayne.
                        
                        
                           
                           68
                           But now I stray from Hope, b

                           What shall our strife for Ornaments encrease?
                           Whilst Aduersaries in our gates conspire
                           To burne our Townes, and blow vs vp with fire,
                           Now by our Hope that vp in heau'n is laid,
                           I instantly you pray, beseech, require,
                           To lend your publique and your priuate aid,
                           That Rulers not for feare, but conscience be obaid.

                           But method here doth stop her farther course;
                           Who preacheth Order, Order must maintayne,
                           Hope must not passe her Mother Faith in trayne,
                           Lest I doe hope for more than I beleeue,
                           For which if I doe pray, I pray in vaine;
                           God without Faith no prayers doth receaue,
                           Hope, Prayer, without Faith, doe oft poore soules deceaue.

                           Thou then that art of Faith and Hope the Spring,
                           I 
                                 •
                              lesse thy Name for this sweet Meditation,
                           This light of Hope which thou to me dost bring,
                           Oh let true Faith direct my Supplication
                           Vnto my Hope thy holy Habitation,
                           That Port of blisse, purchas'd by thine owne Blood,
                           Spent on the Crosse to finish our saluation:
                           This is my Hope, This is my heau'nly Food,
                           On this faire Hope to rest, I hold my chiefest good.
                        
                        
                           71
                           And here, I hope, I may haue leaue to rest,
                           And stop my Muse a while from following
                           The Vertues praises, late so readie prest,
                           In Loues high Court, for my true welcomming:
                           Yet, by Gods grace, I promise here to sing
                           Of all their praises, in their ranke and place;
                           If this mine entrance and first hanselling,
                           Shall but obtayne amongst those Readers grace,
                           Who, by these Vertues aide, hope to behold Loues face.

BELOVED WORTHY
GOOD FRIEND,
Mr. PHILIP KING.
                  IN whom for complement there is no roome,
                  With him doth so much honesty abound,
                  And Iustice to thy Patronage will come,
                  Whom I of all men haue the iustest found:
                  Thou art no curious Critick, nor of those
                  That nothing like in Verse, but all in Prose.
                  
                     All yours,
R. A.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                     
                     
                     MEDITAT. I.
                     Of Iustice and Righteousnesse.
                     
                        1
                        WHen first Gods mouing Spirit forth had brought
                        Beasts, Fowle, Fish, creeping things after their kind:
                        Loe, then He Man in his owne Image wrought,
                        And him a Ruler ouer all assign'd,
                        Writing within the Tablet of his Mind
                        His Law, which should eternally endure,
                        And all the Creatures in Obedience bind
                        To Man their King, and knit his heart as sure
                        To King of Kings. This Law was naturall and pure.
                     
                     
                        2
                        Here first the right of Soueraigntie began,
                        All subiect to the Monarchy of one,
                        For euery Creature subiect is to Man,
                        While he is subiect vnto God alone.
                        This Monarch now is seated in his Throne,
                        And the whole World doth with his Scepter sway:
                        Here's the first president that e're was knowne
                        Of gouernment. From hence, loe, Princes may
                        Learne rightly how to rule, and Subiects to obay.
                     
                     
                        3
                        Thus Man of this great World the little King,
                        To shew his Soueraigntie, gaue all a name,
                        And they their Lord as Subiects reu'rencing,
                        True Vassals to this little King became:
                        Yet Man in honour could not hold the same,
                        But did become rude, disobedient:
                        Breaking that Law, he merits hell, death, shame,
                        When he offends that hath the Regiment,
                        His double sinne deserues a double punishment.
                     
                     
                        
                        4
                        In all his workes before, the Lord had showne,
                        His Loue, Power, Wisedome, Truth and Prouidence:
                        But now Mans sinne his Iustice must make knowne,
                        Though most notorious was the Mans offence,
                        God will not iudge till he makes his defence;
                        Man cited then, appeares vile, naked, lame,
                        There needes no witnesse but his conscience,
                        And though on others he would lay the blame,
                        The more his cause is heard, the more appeares his shame.
                     
                     
                        5
                        Besides th' eternall Law within the heart
                        Of Adam God had wrote with his owne Hand,
                        He did one Precept vnto him impart,
                        Which was indifferent, till God did command
                        Of all the Trees that in the Garden stand,
                        From one, on paine of death, he must refrayne.
                        Lawes made we may not question or withstand:
                        Who breakes them, beares the forfeit of the payne▪
                        
                        When Rulers cease to punish Vice, they sinne maintayne.
                     
                     
                        6
                        Thou that the hearts of all Men dost dispose,
                        Of Kings to rule, and Subiects to obay,
                        From whom all Power proceedes to bind and lose,
                        Who humble Men in iudgement guidest ay;
                        Thou Iudge of all the World, direct, I pray,
                        Thy humble Seruant, to discerne aright
                        Of Iustice, that I her delineate may
                        In her true shape vnto the Peoples sight,
                        That teaching I may learne and practise to doe right.
                     
                     
                        7
                        Shee is a constant and perpetuall Will,
                        That giues to euery Man what is his right;
                        First free from passion, shee continues still
                        Constant in her disposing things aright.
                        In action next shee taketh most delight,
                        And not alone in idle speculation,
                        There's no respect of persons in her sight,
                        The same to all without vaine alteration,
                        For Law's the Rule and Square of her administration.
                     
                     
                        
                        8
                        Iustice the Vertue, Law's the Rule and Square,
                        Whereby we truely Iustice exercise:
                        Wherefore if in the abstract you declare
                        Lawes Nature, shee's perpetuall, constant, wise,
                        And so with God in heau'n for ay abye:
                        But if you view her in the concrete Would,
                        Shee varies as the Subiect her employs,
                        Then blame not Lawes when wrong we doe behould,
                        It comes from Man that's made of corruptible mould.
                     
                     
                        9
                        As when pure Wine in putrid Vessell put,
                        Becomes vnwholesome, ranke, vnsauory,
                        The fault's not in the Wine, but in the Butt,
                        Which doth the sweetnesse of the Wine destroy:
                        Eu'n so it fares with Law and Equitie,
                        In their owne nature they are perfect, pure,
                        But if in Subiects of Iniquitie
                        They are contayn'd, they cannot so endure,
                        But like the Subiect they become corrupt, impure.
                     
                     
                        10
                        Three kinds of Lawes from God I doe obserue;
                        Morall, Iudiciall, Ceremoniall:
                        Which three the Iewes did constantly preserue,
                        As bound in conscience to obay them all.
                        The Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall,
                        Cease, but remayne paternes for imitation:
                        The Morall is the same perpetuall,
                        That most pure Law, which from Mans first creation,
                        Continues still to vs without least alteration.
                     
                     
                        11
                        And though the Rule of Right, now doth not tie
                        To the Iudiciall Lawes strict obseruation,
                        Yet it doth bind vs to the equitie
                        Thereof (as fittest for our imitation:)
                        Though Blasphemie, Theft, Murder, Fornication,
                        Haue not amongst vs now the punishment
                        Which Iewes inflicted by Gods ordination;
                        Yet 'tis a Rule in all good gouernement,
                        The paine vnto the sinne must be equiualent.
                     
                     
                        
                        12
                        As Lawes right to maintayne, and wrong redresse,
                        Should be conform'd to the Iudiciall,
                        So rules of order and of comelinesse,
                        Should imitate Lawes Ceremoniall:
                        The Morall Law (by some call'd Naturall)
                        Is Gods eternall Law, by which aboue
                        He things in Heau'n and Earth disposeth all.
                        These God ingrau'd in Stone, the Iewes to proue,
                        But in our hearts they all now written are by loue.
                     
                     
                        13
                        Mistake me not, that I maintayne hereby
                        Grosse Iudaisme, or out-worne rudiment,
                        Which Christs last Sacrifice did typifie,
                        (Such Ceremonies long agoe are spent)
                        But those whereby we should our selues present
                        In publique Preaching, Sacraments, Deuotions,
                        It well becomes vs all with one consent,
                        To imitate without strife or commotions,
                        'Tis sinne to disobay Lawes in indifferent motions.
                     
                     
                        14
                        I know fnll well there is a Law beside
                        This Morall Law, which some call Naturall,
                        Which vnder God by Nature is impli'de
                        To rule Heau'ns Spheres and Motions, which they call
                        The Law of Nature; By which rise and fall
                        Sunne, Moone, and Starres, in Motion necessarie,
                        But from the Law of Reason, whereby all
                        That Reason haue are Agents voluntarie,
                        By some call'd Reasons Law, my Muse now will not varie.
                     
                     
                        15
                        From hence, as from a Nurserie, doe come
                        All Lawes, which by good Christian Politie
                        And lawfull Power, to vs as bonds become,
                        To keepe vs in the bands of Charitie,
                        And vs preserue from wrong and iniurie,
                        And not by others losse to raise our gayne,
                        But leade our liues in Truth and Honestie,
                        As not enough from euill to restrayne,
                        Except we good performe, and others right maintayne.
                     
                     
                        
                        16
                        Eu'n as we see things wanting life and sense,
                        (But Agents naturall) striue to maintayne
                        The preseruation of the common Ens,
                        
                        And 'gainst their naturall course themselues constrayne,
                        Eu'n Motions against Nature doe darraigne,
                        As heauie stones will vp from Center flie,
                        Rather than all a Vacuum entertayne,
                        So reasonable men should rather die,
                        Then suffer any harme to Vniuersitie.
                     
                     
                        17
                        And hence come Lawes of Nations, which maintayne
                        Leagues betwixt Princes, Freedome, Seruitude:
                        Next ciuill Law, whose equitie did gayne
                        Command of all Romes Empires amplitude.

                           edome did conclude
                        All other Lawes, till Pride and Superstition
                        Amongst those sacred Sanctions did intrude,
                        So Antichristianizing by ambition,
                        That holy Writ must now giue place to their Tradition.
                     
                     
                        18
                        Thus Statutes of each Countrey, Citie, Land,
                        Which they themselues doe call Municipall,
                        All Lawes which now in force with vs doe stand,
                        The Common, Ciuill, Ecclesiasticall,
                        All these doe come from the pure Naturall,
                        And tend true Right and Iustice to maintayne,
                        Respecting Gods true worship aboue all,

                        And last that each man may in peace his owne retayne.
                     
                     
                        19
                        But as from Fountayne seated on a Hill,
                        Pure siluer streames in sundrie Channels flow,
                        First cleare like Spring from which their waters rill,
                        But passing farther thicke and miry grow,
                        (Defiled by their Channels soile below)
                        Eu'n so, all Lawes which from th' Eternall come,
                        First like the paterne are, as pure as snow,
                        But doe in time corrupt and base become,
                        By Mans corrupted heart, through which Lawes streames doe run.
                     
                     
                        
                        20
                        Base Dust and Ashes dares not be so bold,
                        As to define of Righteousnesse Diuine,
                        That Iustice pure which Flesh cannot behold,
                        But as some rayes here seeme below to shine,
                        As farre aboue the reach of humane eyne,
                        As infinite Loue, Truth, and Maiestie,
                        Transcends the measure of a finite Line:
                        Yet Man at first was fram'd thus righteous by
                        The Righteous God, from whom comes none iniquitie.
                     
                     
                        21
                        For nothing that's vnrighteous or vniust,
                        Hath e're or shall be in his Presence seene;
                        Wherefore renouncing all our rags, we must
                        In Christs pure Righteousnesse all clothed beene.
                        It is a wicked fond conceit to weene
                        Mans righteousnesse, once able is to stand
                        Before the Righteous Iudge, where our most cleane
                        And perfect acts, as vile, vnpure, are scand:
                        Oh wretched Man whom thus Presumption holds in band.
                     
                     
                        22
                        My feeble Spirits and Soule amaz'd become,
                        When I contemplate of the Righteousnesse,
                        That with the most Iust God doth euer wonne,
                        My Muse vnable farre is to expresse
                        His Iustice, which is Truth and Holinesse:
                        Therefore I backe now will retire againe
                        To Iustice, that brings Man to Happinesse,
                        And here on Earth doth Peace and Loue maintayne,
                        And first her Nature by her Causes will explayne.
                     
                     
                        23
                        Out of bad causes good effects to draw,
                        Peculiar is to Prouidence Diuine,
                        From whence it comes that many a wholsome Law
                        From euill manners seemes to draw her Line;
                        But they no causes are; For power Diuine
                        Is the first Cause of Iustice and of Right,
                        Eu'n as the Sunne, which giueth powre to shine
                        To all the glorious Lamps wee see by night,
                        Though darknes seeme the cause of their pure twinkling light.
                     
                     
                        
                        24
                        Yet as the Sunne, the Fountayne of all Light,
                        Doth of his beames to all those Planets send,
                        Which in the absence of the Sunne by night,
                        Direct all Trauailers aright to wend:
                        So righteous God such Righteousnesse doth lend
                        To Kings, and Rulers all, that iudge below,
                        That they may Right and Iustice true extend,
                        And in Gods stead both Light and Guidance show
                        To Men, which else to all obliquitie would grow.
                     
                     
                        25
                        At first when Kings and Princes gan to sway,
                        And that no Lawes as yet were on record,
                        All did their Princes will and mind obay,
                        And the whole Law came from the Princes word:
                        Law therefore Kings this Title doth afford,
                        And stiles them liuing Lawes by grace Diuine,
                        Sent vnto Men to be their Liege and Lord,
                        With power to make new Lawes and old define,
                        The Head, which Members all in politique Body ioyne.
                     
                     
                        26
                        Thus God first giues Kings power Lawes to ordayne,
                        Which power Kings to the Iudges delegate;
                        By their Lawes, Right and Iustice to maintayne:
                        All Power from God doth first begin her date,
                        And therefore all ought him to imitate,
                        And thereby to doe right, and wrong redresse;
                        Not onely to encrease their owne estate,
                        And liue in Plentie, Pride, and Wantonnesse,
                        For so we make God cause of our vnrighteousnesse.
                     
                     
                        27
                        So we abuse the Power God doth giue,
                        To Pleasures, Pride, Vnrighteousnesse, and Wrong,
                        As if we onely to our selues did liue,
                        When Iudgement onely doth to God belong,
                        Who eu'n the Kings and Iudges sits among,
                        To doe the Orphane and the Widdow right,
                        To breake delayes that Clients suites prolong,
                        Nor suffering Right to be borne downe by Might,
                        But truely first discerne and then proceede aright.
                     
                     
                        
                        28
                        These true effects of righteous Causes are
                        Like God, first cause of Iustice to proceed,
                        Who pulleth downe the Mightie from his chaire,
                        And sets the Meeke and Humble in his stead.
                        Loe, Iustice hath a sword to make sinne bleede,
                        As well as Scepter for to rule in Peace;
                        Besides our sowing we must also weede,
                        If we expect a plentifull encrease,
                        So long as Vice growes strong, the sword must neuer cease.

                        32
                        Loe, here I could by subiects fiue expresse
                        Fiue seuerall degrees, which Meditation
                        Suggests to me of this pure Righteousnesse.
                        First is of God, from which by deriuation
                        The other foure haue life and sustentation;
                        Of Angels, Kings, and Iudges all, which 
                              •
                           ee
                        Authorised by Princes delegation;
                        Lastly, of Subiects. But the latter three,
                        Corrupted often are by Mans impuritie.
                     
                     
                        33
                        As plants, which haue sole power vegetatiue,
                        Iudge not of Beasts which motion haue and sense,
                        Nor Beasts of Men, that doe in reason thriue,
                        Nor Men of Angels pure diuine Essence,
                        Nor Angels infinite Omnipotence:
                        So Subiects iudge not Iudges vprightnesse;
                        Nor Iudges, Kings; Nor Kings, the excellence
                        Of Angels Iustice; And Angels no lesse
                        Vnable are to iudge of Gods pure Righteousnesse.
                     
                     
                        34
                        Thus euery Soule by right we subiect see
                        To higher Powers, for conscience, not for feare:
                        The Powers that are, by God ordayned bee,

                        To this most perfect Iustice can attayne
                        None, but our Head, surnamed, THAT IVST ON
                              •
                           .
                        Indeed, God made Man righteous, and againe
                        In Heau'n we iust and perfect shall become:
                        But amongst Men so righteous there are none.
                        Yet reade we of a two-fold Vprightnesse;
                        One Legall, which the Law to vs hath showne:
                        The other, which the Gospell doth expresse,
                        Where Grace ac
                              •
                           epts our will by Faith for Righteousnesse.
                     
                     
                        
                        52
                        The Law requires perfect Obedience,
                        Eu'n in that Man that seekes to liue thereby:
                        The Gospell, Faith, and a good Conscience;
                        By Faith Christs Righteousnesse especially
                        Imputed is, which rightly we apply.
                        That, of the Conscience doth the whole Man frame,
                        Willing in all things to liue honestly;
                        This, of Gods Spirit a powerfull worke I name,
                        And none but the regenerate obtayne the same.
                     
                     
                        53
                        For Righteousnesse that thus from Faith doth runne,
                        Let me referre you to that Meditation,
                        Which I of Faith haue formerly begunne,
                        Whereas Christs Merits (ours by Imputation)
                        Stand before God for our Iustification.
                        And thus Christ is of the whole Law the end:
                        For what the Law exacts for our Saluation,
                        Christ hath fulfilled for vs as a Friend,
                        And by the Gospell to Beleeuers doth extend.
                     
                     
                        54
                        The Righteousnesse of a good Conscience,
                        In two things doth consist especially;
                        First, to abstayne from ill with diligence;
                        Next, to doe good willing and constantly:
                        To doe good and auoid iniquitie,
                        Are two essentiall parts of Righteousnesse:
                        Except they both concurre, they both doe die.
                        Loe, thus old Za
                                 •
                              hary and Elizabesse,
                        
                        Were righteous before God, and walkt with men blamelesse.
                     
                     
                        55
                        We Righteousnesse of Faith from Christ receaue:
                        That of the Conscience, is a worke of Grace:
                        The Righteousnesse of Faith will not there cleaue,
                        Where Righteousnesse of Conscience hath not place:
                        This right of Conscience rightly we embrace,
                        When true Repentance working change of mind,
                        Doth the old Man of sinne in vs deface,
                        With resolute purpose in a holy kind,
                        Henceforth to frame our liues as Gods Law hath assign'd.
                     
                     
                        
                        56
                        If thus the mind be truely altered,
                        And change of resolution throughly wrought,
                        Then the whole Man is fitly furnished,
                        To put Faiths Righteousnesse on as he ought.
                        Without true change of mind we soone are brought
                        Like Dogge vnto his vomit to retire;
                        By sinne corrupted Nature's easily caught
                        Againe like Sow to wallow in the mire.
                        High God doth first this inward Righteousnesse require.
                     
                     
                        57
                        Thus by true Faith and a good Conscience,
                        With true Repentance we our selues doe presse,
                        And arme to proofe for sure and firme defence,
                        With brest-plate spirituall of Righteousnesse,
                        Which gards vs from all mortall sinfulnesse.
                        For as the brest-plate hides each vitall part,
                        So that no mortall wound can them oppresse,
                        Eu'n so this Righteousnesse defends the Heart
                        And Conscience, that no mortall sinne can thorough dart.
                     
                     
                        58
                        Thus strongly arm'd, we most assured stand
                        Of our effectuall calling and saluation:
                        For as we God most righteous vnderstand,
                        So know we that the righteous Generation,
                        Are borne of him which brings true exultation,
                        Cladding our Names with happy memorie,
                        Makes much for true religious confirmation,
                        Doth it with Infidels much dignifie,
                        Who seeing our good workes our Maker glorifie.
                     
                     
                        59
                        As are the windings of slie Errours trayne,
                        So are the 
                              •
                           y-paths of Iniquitie;
                        Yet in two Heads we may them all contayne,
                        To Neighbours wrong, to God impietie;
                        Here I some ouer-iust Ones passe not by,
                        (Such as must haue all Bowes by their owne bent)
                        Who by pretence of Christian libertie,
                        Allow nought but what their owne braines inuent,
                        Correctors curious of things indifferent.
                     
                     
                        
                        60
                        Two other Gulfes here I will onely sound;
                        One is of Pharisaicall Righteousnesse;
                        The other with false Libertines is found,
                        Who doe abuse Gods grace to wantonnesse:
                        The last, Faith onely with their tongue professe,
                        But let their conscience wind at libertie.
                        The other make great boast of Vprightnesse
                        And Merits, trusting to be sau'd thereby:
                        Both put asunder those God doth together tie.
                     
                     
                        61
                        (Thus Hymeneus did and Alexander,
                        
                        Who first did put away good Conscience:
                        And then in Schismes and Heresies did wander,
                        Till they made shipwracke of Faiths firme defence.
                        Thus some giu'n ouer to a reprobate sense,
                        Doe fall to senselesse base Idolatrie,
                        Putting in stocks and stones their confidence:
                        And in the mysterie of Iniquitie;
                        Who boasts himselfe to haue of Heau'n and Hell the Key.)
                     
                     
                        62
                        Not but Christ's immense Coate of Righteousnesse,
                        Sufficient is to cloath all that beleeue:
                        But we our Faith by good workes must expresse,
                        If of his Fulnesse we hope to receaue:
                        Yet let Presumption no Man so deceaue,
                        The rags of his inherent Righteousnesse
                        With Christs, in our Redemption for to weaue.
                        By ours we must not hope to come to blisse,
                        Nor euer without ours attayne true Happinesse.
                     
                     
                        63
                        Our Righteousnesse no cause is, but the way,
                        Whereby we to our Heau'nly Citie come:
                        He that doth misse this path, doth walke astray,
                        And head-long with Iniquitie doth run.
                        As in some narrow passage to a Towne,
                        He that will thither passe, one way must treade,
                        Which if he misse, he wanders vp and downe,
                        No path but one the right way him can leade:
                        Yet we the path no cause of comming thither reade.
                     
                     
                        
                        64
                        This path's like Iacobs Ladder, which did reach
                        Eu'n vp to Heau'n, yet stood vpon the ground;
                        From top whereof Christ out his Arme doth stretch,
                        To helpe vp all that in good workes abound.
                        A streight long way and many steps are found,
                        Before we scale the top of Righteousnesse:
                        Gods gracious Spirit doth first this way propound,
                        And guides our feete to moue aright to blesse,
                        But onely Christ aboue doth vs thereof possesse.
                     
                     
                        65
                        In this way Enoch's said to walke with God,
                        And Men began then holy inuocation
                        Next Noah in his Makers grace abode,
                        A iust and perfect Man in's generation.
                        Thus Iob, Lot, Abram, haue their commendation
                        For Iustice, Iudgement, Faith, and Righteousnesse,
                        Walking with Men in vpright conuersation,
                        And towards God in Truth and Holinesse,
                        Thus shewing by her fruits the Faith which they professe.
                     
                     
                        66
                        Thus Patriarchs, Prophets, Iudges, Priests, and Kings,
                        That did beleeue Gods future promises,
                        First fear'd and honour'd him aboue all things,
                        Next walk'd on earth in Truth and Righteousnesse,
                        Labouring in Life and Doctrine to expresse
                        Their firme beliefe of Christ that was to come,
                        Who since is manifested in the Flesh,
                        And doth the end of Righteousnesse become,
                        Which cannot be obtayn'd, vnlesse on earth begun.
                     
                     
                        67
                        Loe, Moses had an eye to this reward,
                        When he left Egypts pleasures, wealth, promotion,
                        The three chiefe baits which Worldlings most regard,
                        Three greatest Enemies to true Deuotion:
                        
                           Ioseph for this despis'd his Mistris motion,
                        And rather chose that stocks his limbs should lame,
                        Than he would taste of Lusts vnrighteous potion.
                        Loe, Christ a wretch for Righteousnesse became,
                        And for the Iusts reward endur'd the Crosses shame.
                     
                     
                        
                        68
                        If I should count all the Authorities,
                        Which of this Vertue in Gods Word abound,
                        One Volume to hold all would not suffice,
                        In eu'ry Booke, Verse, Chapter, to be found:
                        But most of all, the holy Psalmes propound
                        Abundant matter for this Meditation;
                        The which my Reader I doe leaue to sound,
                        That willing is to make right application,
                        And follow Righteousnesse in life and conuersation.
                     
                     
                        69
                        But though I tremble whilst I heare Paul reason
                        Of Temp'rance, Iudgement, Truth and Righteousnesse,
                        Yet carelesse take a more conuenient season,
                        Like Foelix, in my life it to expresse,
                        And grope for Bribes the wronged to redresse;
                        I cannot tell how soone of this my rome,
                        My Maker will a iuster Man possesse,
                        And then to strict account I needs must come,
                        And be rewarded as to others I haue done.

                        Were mortall eyes but able to behold,
                        The glorious splendour and the light Diuine,
                        The Crownes, Ioyes, Honours, Pleasures manifold
                        Prepar'd for them that liue by righteous Line,
                        And how the Righteous like the Sunne shall shine
                        With Sonne and Father in eternall blesse,
                        We nould at Crosse, reproch, or shame repine,
                        Which though they seeme some burthen to the flesh,
                        More free our soules hereby conuerse in Holinesse.
                     
                     
                        71
                        But ah, Sinne on our Nature hangs so fast,
                        And pricks with honour, pleasure, wealth, and ease,
                        That Coward-like our Armour off we cast,
                        And for promotion flatter, fawne, and please.
                        Then Satan takes aduantage vs to seise
                        As Captiues, being naked and vnarm'd,
                        Whom though before perhaps he might disease,
                        Yet neuer could vs mortally haue harm'd,
                        If with brest-plate of Righteousnesse we had beene arm'd.
                     
                     
                        
                        72
                        Oh, but 'tis too great burthen to the flesh,
                        To keepe this Armour on continually,
                        And to our nature breeds great wearinesse,
                        To so great watchfulnesse our soules to tye:
                        But since it doth assure vs victorie,
                        Who would not beare this burthen for a while?
                        Besides, the burthen of Iniquitie
                        Is heauier, and doth our soules defile,
                        Though for a time with pleasures false it vs beguile.
                     
                     
                        73
                        Oh, let this brest-plate then of Righteousnesse
                        Be on my Soule and Body alwayes prest:
                        The more this burthen doth my Body presse,
                        My Soule is sure to find more ease and rest:
                        No paine, shame, or reproch, that vs molest,
                        Are worthy of the Crowne most glorious,
                        Which God the Righteous Iudge hath readie drest,
                        For to bestow vpon the Righteous,
                        Made so by God his acceptation gracious.
                     
                     
                        74
                        For I confesse it is thy acceptation
                        Which makes our Righteousnesse (though dung and losse,
                        Compared to the Lawes strict obseruation)
                        Most perfect: Thou hast nayled to Christs Crosse
                        All our offences: By him all our drosse
                        Is turn'd to purest Gold in fire tried.
                        Where God accepts, no power of Hell can crosse,
                        If by true Faith our hearts be purified,
                        Our imperfections by Christs perfectnesse supplied.
                     
                     
                        75
                        Oh then, most perfect Sunne of Righteousnesse,
                        Vouchsafe that now thy Spirit of Grace may shine
                        Vpon mine Heart, by Truth and Holinesse,
                        Temp'rance, Faith, Hope, Obedience, Loue Diuine,
                        That all my words, thoughts, actions, I may line,
                        And leuell out by thy pure Rule of Right;
                        All errour, lying, iniurie decline,
                        And hauing of thy Lawes a most cleare sight,
                        I may to walke therein place all my hearts delight.
                     
                     
                        
                        76
                        Make me conceiue the profit, vse, and end
                        Of righteousnesse, and the necessitie
                        I of this brest-plate haue, my Soule to fand
                        Against the furie of mine enemie:
                        And grant, my conscience good may testifie
                        The armes whereby I may stand fast and sure,
                        And not those fain'd ones of Hypocrisie,
                        Which neuer can hold out me to secure,
                        Or any of the fierie darts of Hell endure.
                     
                     
                        77
                        But it is not in him, that wils or runneth,
                        For to attaine the Crowne of righteousnesse,
                        From whom each perfect gift and good grace commeth,
                        His grace it is that guides to happinesse:
                        We find amongst those gracious promises,
                        And grants, which in thy holy Word we reade,
                        That who seekes first thy Kingdomes righteousnesse,
                        Shall haue, all things whereof he stands in neede
                        Doe thou, Oh Lord me forth then in this right way leade.
                     
                     
                        78
                        Thou the whole Scripture gau'st by inspiration,
                        Apt to instruct, improue, correct, represse,
                        To make the man of God wise to saluation,
                        And perfectly instruct in righteousnesse:
                        And when the wicked turne from wickednesse,
                        Thou promisest their Soules aliue to saue:
                        So many are thy gracious promises,
                        To grant all good things that the righteous craue,
                        That I this righteousnesse doe begge and hope to haue.
                     
                     
                        79
                        Then, as a Lyon, shall I be most bold,
                        My righteous way shall shine eu'n as the light,
                        The eyes then of the Lord shall me behold
                        And he will grant me eu'n my hearts delight.
                        In all his Statutes I shall walke aright,
                        And all his iudgements iust and true obserue,
                        My death shall be most precious in his sight,
                        My righteous memorie he will reserue,
                        Yea eu'n the righteous seede he will on earth preserue.
                     
                     
                        
                        80
                        To praise God for the blessings manifold
                        His Word assures vnto this righteous Nation,
                        Would in discourse my Muse for euer hold,
                        And be too long for this one Meditation.
                        Oh, hold me then to more strict obseruation
                        Of Time to come, than I haue had of past,
                        That I may make a daily examination
                        Of my whole life and all my sinnes vp cast,
                        As mindfull of th'account I am to giue at last.
                     
                     
                        81
                        And teach me, that this Grace of Righteousnesse
                        Is as a Chaine of many links close ioyn'd,
                        By which we would ascend from hence to blesse,
                        Whereof if but the least linke doth vnbind,
                        Loe, the whole Chaine is to the earth declin'd:
                        Eu'n so in this strong Chaine of Law and Right,
                        Though most of all our acts be rightly lin'd;
                        If one Iniquitie our Hearts delight,
                        This one makes all the rest vnrighteous in Gods sight.
                     
                     
                        82
                        But I vniustly my discourse extend:
                        Now I beseech the Authour of this Grace,
                        I all my force to practise it may bend,
                        And first doe Right and Iustice in my place,
                        Respecting not the Person but the Case,
                        In my Commerce with all Men dealing right.
                        Last, that I may true Righteousnesse embrace,
                        That with true Faith and a good Conscience dight,
                        I in these spirituall Armes vnto the end may 
                              •
                           ight.
                     
                     
                        83
                        Thus hauing chalked out the Rule of Right,
                        I should by my first Method next proceede
                        To sing of Mercy: but Truth doth inuite
                        My Muse first her great power to areede,
                        Who doth in time eu'n Righteousnesse preceede.
                        Besides, none can approch dread Mercies Throne,
                        But those whom Truth and Iustice thither leade,
                        And sure their Nature links them so in one,
                        As one without the other neuer goes alone.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     MEDITAT. II.
                     Of Truth.
                     
                        1
                        
                           SVch is the nature and sweet inclination
                        Of heau'nly Graces all, whereof I sing,
                        That with most kind and mutuall relation,
                        They all seeme ioyn'd together in a ring,
                        So close each one another following,
                        That who gets one doth all the rest obtayne.
                        For, from one Fountayne all of them doe spring,
                        All link'd together in so strong a chayne,
                        As where one Vertue dwels, there all the rest remayne.
                     
                     
                        2
                        'Tis vaine to thinke that single Graces can
                        Make vp complete the Man spirituall,
                        More than diuided Members of a Man
                        Can grow, or thriue, not ioyn'd together all.
                        Hence Poet
                              •
                            the three Graces twins doe call,
                        
                           Ioues Daughters, and them in one ring doe ioyne;
                        And hence they make the Virgins musicall
                        All but one consort, which are Sisters nine:
                        Thus by their fables shadowing things Diuine.
                     
                     
                        3
                        For they discern'd by Natures dimmed light,
                        One Authour sole of eu'ry goodly Grace,
                        Whom Father they and King of all doe hight,
                        And him Lord ouer all their gods doe place.
                        Loe, thus as in a mist they Truth did trace,
                        But missing the true path of Righteousnesse,
                        In stead of Truth they Errour did embrace,
                        For neuer was Dame Iustice Errours guesse,
                        Nor euer Truth did dwell with false Vnrighteousnesse.
                     
                     
                        
                        4
                        For seeming Truth, without the 
                              〈◊〉
                            of Right,
                        Like Summum 
                                 〈◊〉
                              
                            is greatest iniurie:
                        And Righteousnesse not guided by Truths light,
                        Is Curiousnesse or false Hypocrisie,
                        Faith that brings forth fruits of Iniquitie,
                        Is base Presumption; Loue, Diffimulation;
                        That worketh not in vs by Charitie,
                        All from one Head haue life and sustentation,
                        And therefore all together make their habitation.
                     
                     
                        5
                        But none more like are, or of Kin more neare,
                        Than this faire paire of Truth and Righteousnesse;
                        The blessed Mother and her Daughter deare;
                        For Truth the Mother is of Vprightnesse:
                        And surely, Truth and honest Simplenesse
                        To eu'ry Vertue doth so needfull grow,
                        That all faire shewes not done in Singlenesse,
                        And Truth of Heart, are but a false vaine show,
                        A splendid sinne corrupted by Mans heart below.
                     
                     
                        6
                        Thou, in whose Lips was neuer found least guile,
                        Whose Heart hates lying and iniquitie,
                        Whose Hands did neuer God or Man beguile,
                        Whose Hand, Heart, Word, and Thought, is Veritie,
                        Whose blessed Spirit of Truth doth testifie
                        Vnto our Spirits true way of Righteousnesse,
                        By which we come to liue eternally,
                        Direct my Muse Truths nature to expresse,
                        That Truth may guide my steps to endlesse Happinesse.
                     
                     
                        7
                        My bounded Muse here dareth not define
                        Of boundlesse Truth from all Eternitie,
                        Which as impossible's to mete by Line,
                        As Persons three, which in the Trinitie
                        Make but one Truth and perfect Vnitie.
                        But as one God consists of Persons three,
                        And each participates of Deitie;
                        So we one Truth communicated see
                        To Persons three, which but one in the God-head bee.
                     
                     
                        
                        8
                        Of Father, 
                              〈◊〉
                           , and Spirit of Truth we reade
                        But as one God, so but one Truth alone;
                        Into which Truth the Spirit of Truth doth leade,
                        Who sent is from the Father and the Sonne.
                        The Word of Truth that gloriously did won
                        With Spirit and Father from eternitie:
                        Flesh here tooke of our flesh, bone of our bone,
                        To free vs from errours captiuitie,
                        And chalk't vs out a way to walke in Veritie.
                     
                     
                        9
                        This is the Truth whereof I meane to write,
                        Which ought to be of our whole Life the square,
                        To leuell out our words, thoughts, acts aright,
                        And eke our Iudgements to Gods Word to square:
                        For of this Truth foure parts there onely are,
                        Of Iudgement, Action, Speech, and of the Heart,
                        The want of one, the rest doth all impaire;
                        Wrong iudgement, words, and actions doth diuert,
                        But a false heart doth iudgement, action, speech peruert.
                     
                     
                        10
                        And that I right and plainely may proceede,
                        I will all foure thus singled out define;
                        And first the Truth of Iudgement I doe reade,Truth of Iudgement.
                        
                        A power inlightning of Gods Spirit Diuine,
                        Which doth Mans vnderstanding part refine,
                        And settles in the Doctrine of his Word:
                        Behold, when Truth doth in our iudgement shine,
                        All Heresie and Schismes by vs abhord,
                        This Truth of Iudgement sacred Knowledge doth afford.
                     
                     
                        11
                        Truth of the Heart is a sweet singlenesse
                        And sincere meaning,Truth of Heart. whereby Man constraynes
                        His Heart to approue it selfe in Holinesse,
                        To him that searcheth both the Heart and Raynes.
                        This in the inward Man the Truth contaynes,
                        And is to God most acceptable treasure:
                        This Truth from all Hypocrisie refraynes:
                        Here doth the Deuill soonest take his seasure,
                        For, loe, the Heart of man's deceitfull aboue measure.
                     
                     
                        
                        12
                        The Truth of Speech is when our hearts agree
                        Vnto the matter and vnto our mind:Truth of Speech.
                        
                        For if it from our Heart doe disagree,
                        Or from the thing whereto it is design'd,
                        The first to be plaine lying is defin'd.
                        The second, falshood at the best we name:
                        One doth abuse the Conscience and the Mind;
                        The other brings the Authour vnto shame;
                        Both falsifie the Truth and are alike to blame.
                     
                     
                        13
                        The Truth of Actions,Truth of Action. honest dealing, plaine,
                        Faithfull in all without dissimulation:
                        With God and Man whether we lose or gaine,
                        When we doe not deceiue by simulation,
                        And feigning things without determination;
                        Or else dissembling whereabouts we goe:
                        These are from Truth a wicked declination,
                        And when we God or Man deceauen so,
                        What we would vnto vs, to others we not doe.
                     
                     
                        14
                        But as a naturall body doth consist
                        Of quarters foure, to make a man complete,
                        And if but one of all those foure be mist,
                        The other three lose all their life and heate:
                        Eu'n so it is with Truth, whereof I treate,
                        If of these foure substantiall parts want one,
                        The other three are vainenesse or deceat;
                        For Truth of Iudgement, Heart, Speech, Action,
                        Make but one Truth without dissimulation.
                     
                     
                        15
                        But Truth of Iudgement ground is and foundation
                        Of all the rest: For be our Hearts sincere,
                        Our words and deeds without dissimulation,
                        If Errour in our Iudgements doth appeare,
                        With Paul we may eu'n persecute the deare
                        And holy Seruants of the Sonne of Truth,
                        And thinke we doe to God good seruice here.
                        Fie then on Fooles that misse-spend their youth,
                        They neuer seeke to know or learne the way of Truth.
                     
                     
                        
                        16
                        But be our Iudgements eu'n as right and sound,
                        As Christs Disciples by their Master taught;
                        Yet if within vs Iudas hearts be found,
                        On vs the greater iudgement shall be wrought.
                        Who knowes his Masters will and doth it nought,
                        Oh, what doth he by this his knowledge gayne,
                        But eu'n the sting of his owne conscience brought
                        To desperation and infernall payne,
                        And to put out this sting puts on an hempen chayne?
                     
                     
                        17
                        What shall we say of those that doe professe
                        Truth of Religion, and a Heart sincere?
                        Yet in their dealings nothing lesse expresse,
                        But for their gayne deceaue, lie, and forsweare:
                        Surely, these men a double heart doe beare:
                        For were the Heart, which is a liuely Spring,
                        Whence flow our words and deeds, oh were that cleare,
                        Then all the streames from thence forth issuing,
                        Would be pure like the fountain, from whence they do spring.
                     
                     
                        18
                        But things we best of all by causes know:
                        God is the Cause of each good gift and grace,
                        But here more mediate Causes I may show,
                        Whereby he in the Truth doth guide our pace.
                        By's Word we Truth of Iudgement doe embrace,
                        Which is to wandring Soules a guide and light,
                        His Spirit vpon our Hearts doth Truth enchase,
                        Then Truth of Iudgement makes vs speake aright,
                        And Truth of Heart makes all our actions true and right.
                     
                     
                        19
                        Thus (as Effects) true Speech and Actions flow
                        From Truth of Iudgement, and the Truth of Heart,
                        As all Mankind from Eue and Adam grow:
                        But if the subtill Serpent can peruert
                        Our Hearts or Iudgements, as he did diuert
                        Our two first Parents, then as all their seede
                        Defiled is with their corrupted part,
                        So from our Heart and Iudgement will proceede
                        Corrupted words and actions which such fountaynes breede.
                     
                     
                        
                        20
                        Therefore to set our Iudgement true and right,
                        We to the ground and pillar ought to come
                        Of Truth, which is the Church of God, so hight,
                        Because the treasures of all Truth there won,
                        Of all Gods Oracles which there haue rome.
                        From which all Truth of Iudgement we deriue,
                        The Church a carefull Keeper doth become:
                        There's Truth that able is to saue aliue,
                        And away Errour, Darknesse, Superstition driue.
                     
                     
                        21
                        O blessed Truth, that holy Church preserues
                        From Satans malice, and the Moth of time,
                        O glorious Church, whose soundnesse pure reserues
                        Truth of Religion, which doth make thee shine
                        In Righteousnesse, Faith, Hope, and Loue Diuine,
                        More then Pompe, Wealth, Vniuersalitie:
                        For Truth doth decke Christs Spouse more trim and fine
                        Then Time, Consent, Succession, Vnitie,
                        Now foild with Superstition and Idolatrie.
                     
                     
                        22
                        With these false Ornaments the Church of Rome,
                        Like painted Harlot, shuns the open Light:
                        Nor will vnto the Ground and Pillar come
                        Of Truth, to trie if shee bee wrong or right.
                        Therefore, poore Laiks neuer must haue sight
                        Of holy Writ, to frame their Iudgement by:
                        Traditions and false Miracles them light,
                        And on the Churches word they must relie:
                        Thus Ignorance the Mother is of Poperie.
                     
                     
                        23
                        But as sound Truth abhorres such Ignorance,
                        Eu'n so presumptuous curiositie
                        Shee doth decline, nor euer doth aduance
                        Her purest thoughts to things that be too high:
                        Her subiect is no higher Mysterie,
                        Than Spirit of Truth is pleased to reueale:
                        Into Gods secret Counsell for to prie,
                        Is like the Thiefe that fire from Heau'n did steale,
                        To whom eu'n Heathen iudgements endlesse torments seale.
                     
                     
                        
                        24
                        So vniuersall is Truths glorious Fame,
                        That all things that the Heau'n and Earth contaynes,
                        Delight to be adorned by her Name:
                        Yea, God himselfe Truths title not disdaynes:
                        Loe, He Lord God of Truth for ay remaynes.
                        The Word of Truth, the Spirit of Truth, likewise
                        Wayes, iudgements, works cōmandements Truth retaynes
                        In this, Saints, Angels, with God sympathize:
                        But Satan and his broode delight in contraries.
                     
                     
                        25
                        Thus as shee is adorn'd by Titles high,
                        So with her Glorie shee doth all adorne:
                        Nothing vnto perfection commeth nigh,
                        Except by them the badge of Truth be borne.
                        And though some Worldlings doe her Liuerie scorne,
                        As things against their pleasure, ease, and gayne,
                        For that plaine dealing is a Iewell worne,
                        But he that weares it, beggerie shall gayne;
                        Yet Truth her credit still doth with the best retayne.
                     
                     
                        26
                        Yea Truth amongst the Writers of all times,
                        Hath beene in such great honour and account,
                        As without Truth yet neuer Prose or Rimes
                        To any Praise or Honour vp did mount.
                        The holy Writ, wherein Truth doth surmount,
                        Shee safely doth'gainst all her Foes defend.
                        How oft doth Dauids muse Gods Truth recount,
                        Whereby her glorie lasts to the Worlds end?
                        Ah, my poore Muse, see thou alwayes on Truth attend.

                        There's not one Vertue that with Loue doth dwell,
                        But honours Truth, and seekes her company:
                        Begin eu'n at Humilities low Cell,
                        And mount to Mercy that doth sit on high,
                        All seeke the companie of Veritie.
                        Eu'n Loue must be without dissimulation,
                        And Righteousnesse without Hypocrisie,
                        Vnfaigned Faith, true constant Expectation.
                        No Vertue without Truth comes neare Loues habitation.

                        Are but as falsely feigned Holinesse,
                        Which surely doubles the iniquitie,
                        And neuer leades the way to Happinesse.
                        My Muse is farre vnable to expresse
                        The prayses all of Peeres that Truth attends,
                        Whom shee adornes with wondrous Noblenesse:
                        But Righteousnesse vpon her most depends,
                        And Mercy now and Truth haue met & growne great friends.

                        But shee doth find as many Enemies:
                        For Satan all his malice 'gainst her bends,
                        Supplanting Her by force or subtilties.
                        He father is of errours and of lyes,
                        And seekes herewith Truths glorie to distaine,
                        And therefore they maliciously deuise
                        Interpretations false, and glosses vaine,

                        By girding him, what death he ought to die,
                        Whereby he should the Truth of God much glorifie.
                     
                     
                        45
                        And this hath made the Martyrs of all Ages
                        (Till death, their Truth of Iudgement to maintayne;)
                        Sealing with blood the Truth of sacred pages,
                        And whilst they here endur'd most cruell payne,
                        They ioyfull were in hope of glorious gayne,
                        Yea many haue embraced losse and shame,
                        In singlenesse of heart Truth to maintayne.
                        But what though here they doe endure some blame?
                        The true in heart shall gayne an euerlasting name.
                     
                     
                        46
                        
                           Dauid a man call'd after Gods owne heart,
                        For inward Truth and Singlenesse within.
                        No beautie, eloquence, or outward part
                        Can so commend a man: For Truth doth winne
                        The loue of God and Man: But that foule sinne
                        Of lying Lips and a deceitfull Heart,
                        Is an abomination vnto him.
                        In eu'ry triall Truth maintaynes her part,
                        But all dissemblers (Adam-like) aside doe start.
                     
                     
                        47
                        Loe, many Daughters haue done vertuously,
                        But glorious Truth doth farre surmount them all.
                        Yet if I onely sing of Veritie,
                        And labour not to practise it at all,
                        But from my Loynes her Girdle loosen shall,
                        It had beene better I had neuer knowne
                        The way of Truth, than afterwards to fall
                        And leaue the Light, that vnto me was showne,
                        Choking those seeds of Grace the Spirit of Truth had sowne.
                     
                     
                        
                        48
                        But ah, the Deuill and his Instruments
                        Continually doe seeke our Truth to spoile:
                        And by feare, force, and Worlds allurements,
                        Our Soules of this rich Iewell to beguile.
                        Loe, Romanists adulterate and defile
                        Eu'n Truths pure Fountaynes and sweet liuely Spring:
                        And Worldlings true sinceritie doe soile
                        With odious name of false dissembling,
                        And eu'n with basest termes Gods Priests dishonouring.
                     
                     
                        49
                        Ah, now we with the fashion all doe run;
                        As Buildings, Wares, Apparell, are for show,
                        So is Religion and Deuotion;
                        Where is most pompe and glorie, thither flow
                        The greatest multitude; From whence doth grow
                        To such a height the name of Poperie;
                        Yea, many of vs seeke for praise to know;
                        But leaue true practise in sinceritie,
                        When not to know, but doe Gods will is charitie.
                     
                     
                        50
                        Fashion and Custome now so tyrannize,
                        As comely honest Truth they doe out-face:
                        If it the Fashion be vs to disguise,
                        It as a comely Custome we embrace;
                        That which Paul thought a Womans foule disgrace,
                        Like Man to haue her head vncouer'd, shorne,
                        Amongst our Women holds a goodly grace,
                        Like vnto mens their garments now be worne,
                        As they in Truth the frailtie of their Sexe did scorne.
                     
                     
                        51
                        But I could wish with all our power and might,
                        As in Gods presence pure we all did stand,
                        We would goe, thinke, know, speake, and practise right
                        In Truth of Iudgement, with Tongue, Heart, and Hand;
                        This God did vnto Abraham command,
                        To walke before him and to be vpright:
                        Walking before God makes vs vpright stand;
                        Vprightnesse shewes we walke as in Gods sight:
                        Who thinks God him beholds, how dares he doe vnright?
                     
                     
                        
                        52
                        Let me here tell you, how a holy Man
                        A Harlot did diuert from filthy quest;
                        Who by her comely feature many wan
                        To leaue their owne, and foile her filthy nest.
                        Himselfe in habit of a Gallant drest,
                        Agreed and paid, desir'd a secret rome,
                        Shee him vnto a Chamber streight addrest,
                        So close that therein not the least light shone,
                        But ah (said he) Gods eye vs here may see alone.
                     
                     
                        53
                        Alas (said shee) no place can be so close,
                        That can vs hide from Gods all-seeing Eye:
                        Dost thou beleeue (saith he) God sees thy grosse,
                        Thy beastly foule sinne of adulterie,
                        And fear'st not lest his furie should destroy,
                        Eu'n whilst in this presumptuous sinne thou art,
                        And thee condemne to Hell eternally?
                        My Authour saith, hereby he did conuert
                        Her wicked life to Truth and Singlenesse of Heart.
                     
                     
                        54
                        Though many imperfections we doe feele,
                        And our corruptions downe so sore vs presse,
                        That Vice into our Hearts doth often steale,
                        And vnawares deceaue with sinfulnesse;
                        Yet if by sorrow true and humblenesse
                        We purge our Hearts of what is entred in,
                        And after seeke by carefull watchfulnesse,
                        Them to preserue hereafter from like sinne,
                        We may grow to some perfectnesse of Truth within.
                     
                     
                        55
                        But I confesse, that though with all my might
                        I labour for true puritie of mind,
                        And would doe nothing but as in the sight
                        Of God and Angels, and of all Mankind;
                        Yet often my deceitfull heart I find
                        Tempting me secretly such things to doe,
                        Which I should not dare venture in that kind,
                        If some Man present were the same to know:
                        Yet Truth the closest of them all to God doth show.
                     
                     
                        
                        56
                        What, shall man
                              •
                            presence make me true and iust?
                        And shall not Gods, that 
                              •
                           ees my secret thought,
                        To whom for all one day account I must,
                        And be rewarded as I here haue wrought?
                        Shall not his presence me deterre from ought,
                        That may offend his sacred Maiestie?
                        The Sonne of Truth whose blood me dearely bought,
                        And grieue the holy Spirit of Truth, whereby
                        Seal'd and redeem'd I am from Hels captiuitie.
                     
                     
                        57
                        Oh thou that Truth requir'st in inward parts,
                        Vs secretly mak'st Wisedome vnderstand,
                        Renewing Spirits aright and clensing Hearts,
                        By whom in Truth and Righteousnesse we stand,
                        My way direct right to the holy Land,
                        Through Deserts wide of this Worlds wildernesse;
                        Feede me with heau'nly Manna from thine Hand,
                        With water from a Rocke my soule refresh,
                        And thorough Iordanes flood conduct to endlesse blesse.
                     
                     
                        58
                        The humble thou hast promised to guide,
                        And to direct his path aright for ay.
                        Who seeke vnfeignedly in Truth t'abide,
                        Thou neuer sufferest to goe astray;
                        Oh then direct my goings in thy way,
                        My iudgement, heart, hand, tongue, in Veritie;
                        Thou readier art to heare then I to pray:
                        Then grant me Loue, Faith, Hope, Humilitie,
                        And season eu'ry Grace with Hearts sinceritie.
                     
                     
                        59
                        God is my Shepheard, How then can I stray?
                        He is my Light, Truth, and my righteous Guide,
                        His rod and staffe my slipperie feete doth stay,
                        Lest they at any time doe slip aside:
                        His Truth and Mercy euermore abide;
                        Though Wine and Women and the King are strong,
                        I nothing feare if Truth be on my side;
                        Thy Truth and Mercy shall my dayes prolong:
                        Of thy great Truth and Mercy euer be my song.
                     
                     
                        
                        60
                        Oh, let thy Word of Truth my Iudgement sway,
                        Thy Spirit of Truth mine inward Man inlight,
                        Incline mine Heart to learne, will, to obay,
                        And on thy Truth set thou my whole delight,
                        On it to meditate both day and night:
                        That whether I eate, sleepe, walke, watch, or pray,
                        I may remember I am in thy sight,
                        So shall I conscience make of euery way,
                        And be most carefull what I aske, doe, thinke, or say.
                     
                     
                        61
                        But, ah, dread Mercy, I too long forbeare
                        To tune my Dittie to thy sacred praise,
                        Who wert so gracious vnto me whileare,
                        When I appeal'd from Iustice stricter Sayes,
                        Vnto thy Throne of Grace where though my wayes
                        Were all discouer'd, by thy gracious dome
                        I was absolu'd. But next I will thee praise,
                        Now I with Truth and Righteousnesse haue done:
                        For none without these two to Mercies grace can come.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     MEDITAT. III.
                     Of Mercy.
                     
                        1
                        
                           IF any mightie Monarch chance enquire,
                        Why I sweet Mercies seate doe place so high,
                        Since shee the lowliest Cell doth most desire,
                        Her selfe delighting sole in miserie,
                        The onely Object of her pitying eye:
                        He hence for greatnesse may this lesson gaine,
                        That as he growes in Pow'r and Maiestie,
                        To Poore he ought the greater Mercy daine,
                        Thus imitating him by whom eu'n Princes raigne.
                     
                     
                        2
                        For though this Dame be of such wondrous grace,
                        So neare in fauour to the Queene of Loue,
                        That next to her s
                              •
                           ee gaynes the soueraigne place,
                        Both here below, and in the Heau'n aboue;
                        Yea though to heau'nly Loue so like shee proue,
                        That scarse the one from th'other can be knowne,
                        (Though to be mercifull, and truely Loue
                        Doe differ much, as after shall be showne)
                        Yet her great bounty's not to meanest wretch vnknowne.
                     
                     
                        3
                        For as the Sunne, from highest firmament
                        Vouchsafes on good and bad alike to shine,
                        And clouds of Heau'n doe raine indifferent
                        On fertile Land, and on the barren Mine;
                        So vnto all shee offers Grace Diuine:
                        But as the Cause is not in Sunne nor Raine,
                        But in the Soile, why it doth fruitlesse line,
                        So sinne's the cause some cannot Grace retaine,
                        Which shines and waters bad and barren hearts in vaine.
                     
                     
                        
                        4
                        A depth all bottomlesse I now doe sound,
                        A height which higher than the Heau'ns doth reach,
                        So wide as nothing it can compasse round,
                        For Mercy ouer all Gods workes doth stretch;
                        So farre beyond mans limited fraile reach,
                        As to conceaue of Gods Eternitie,
                        Or how he all doth out of nothing fetch,
                        Darknesse from Light, Ioy out of Miserie,
                        From Warre true Peace; high Honour from Humilitie.
                     
                     
                        5
                        Thou, God of Mercy! blessed Trinitie!
                        Who first in thine owne Image didst create
                        Man pure and good: But when Hels subtiltie
                        Had him deiected from so happy state,
                        Abandoning to endlesse Bale and Hate,
                        That riches of thy Mercy might appeare,
                        Didst for thy Mercies sake regenerate,
                        And all his score by thy Bloods price didst cleare,
                        Grant I may rightly sing and practise Mercy here.
                     
                     
                        6
                        Which is a certayne pitifull regard,
                        Which we of others miserie conceaue,
                        Whereby our hearts are moued and prepar'd,
                        Them, what we can, to succour and relieue:
                        That Passion and Affection which doth grieue
                        Mans heart, to see anothers miserie,
                        Doth not vnto th'Almighties Mercy cleaue,
                        No more than Anger, Hate, and Iealousie,
                        As they distempers are, be in the Trinitie.
                     
                     
                        7
                        No words indeed can properly expresse
                        Gods Mercy, Anger, Hate, or Iealousie,
                        But as wee see their fruits wee them confesse,
                        To be in God by Anthropopathy:
                        
                        Gods punishment of foule iniquitie,
                        We call reuenge: But when he Grace doth show
                        To those which are in woe and miserie,
                        We call that Mercy: Not but we well know,
                        No passion or distemper in Gods Nature grow.
                     
                     
                        
                        8
                        That Mercy may the plainelyer be descri'de,
                        And we her diuerse Nature better know,
                        I her into two Currents doe diuide;
                        The Mercy God on Creatures doth bestow,
                        And that which he requires of vs below:
                        For as God is by Nature pittifull,
                        So he delights in them that Mercy shew;
                        For he by Nature is most Mercifull,
                        And therefore vnto all in Fruits most plentifull.
                     
                     
                        9
                        Gods Nature is Eternall, Infinite,
                        So is his Mercy stretched out to all,
                        Eu'n as the Sunne to Man and Beast giues light,
                        And Raine on bad and good alike doe fall:
                        But this we call Gods Mercy generall,
                        Which lasts but for a time. But on the Iust
                        He shewes his Mercy more especiall,
                        Which euerlasting is: wherein we trust,
                        And whereby He to Blisse will rayse vs from the Dust.
                     
                     
                        10
                        But here we must haue an especiall Care,
                        Lest diff'rence of Gods Mercy we confound,
                        Not speciall euerlasting Grace to share,
                        Where he but common, generall, doth propound:
                        This is a firme Position, true and sound,
                        That God in Vnbeliefe hath shut vp all,
                        That his great Mercy might to all abound;
                        Vnto the Wicked, common, generall,
                        Eternall vnto them, that on him rightly call.
                     
                     
                        11
                        God grant to Me this Mercy speciall,
                        That of Mans Mercy I may right enquire,
                        That teaching, I may practise it withall,
                        The Mercy that God doth of vs require,
                        Of which, a two-fold kind make one entire;
                        First towards Sinners, that doe goe astray,
                        The next to Poore, and those that Helpe desire;
                        First pitties Soules, and leads them in right way,
                        The last supplyes their Wants, that Need haue eu'ry Day.
                     
                     
                        
                        12
                        For as Mans soule is his most noble part,
                        Whereon his sole eternall Blisse depends,
                        So he the greatest Mercy doth impart,
                        Who to poore wandring Soules his Mercy sends:
                        He that giues to the Poore, he surely lends
                        To God, that will foure-fold his gift repay;
                        But who to saue poore Soules his Mercy spends,
                        Shall sure obtayne those Crownes at that great Day,
                        Which God doth vp in store for such Soule-sauers lay.
                     
                     
                        13
                        In men we diuers outward causes see,
                        Which them to Mercy and Compassion moue;
                        Some by remembrance of like miserie,
                        Which in themselues they formerly did proue;
                        Some Kindred, Youth, Acquaintance, friendly Loue,
                        Learning, Nobilitie, to Pitie leade:
                        But none of these cause Mercy from aboue,
                        But it from Gods sole goodnesse doth proceede,
                        And not from any thing that in our Natures breede.
                     
                     
                        14
                        Therefore as God doth on vs Mercy show
                        For the great riches onely of his Grace,
                        So we no other cause of Mercy know,
                        Whereby our Fellow members we embrace,
                        But his sole Grace: whose Mercy did deface
                        Eu'n Works hand-writing once against vs brought,
                        No works of Mercy can in heau'n haue place,
                        In Faith and Charitie that are not wrought:
                        Then Mercies works for shew, or Merit come to nought.
                     
                     
                        15
                        None can to Mercies perfectnesse attayne
                        But onely God, whose Mercy's ouer all;
                        No number can our miseries contayne,
                        Yet God in store hath Mercy for them all:
                        Onely in words, Gods Mercy doth not fall,
                        But most in fruits and comforts doth abound,
                        As Mercy hath no measure, so withall,
                        Her fruits and works all numbers doe confound,
                        Mans life a daily exercise thereof is found.
                     
                     
                        
                        16
                        'Tis not a heauie Heart or grieued Mind,
                        Compassionate of others miseries,
                        Whereby afflicted Soules no profit find,
                        But as our Heart, so our Abilities
                        Must minister to Saints necessities;
                        They that the Heart and Hand in this disioyne,
                        Faith aud good Workes to sunder doe deuise.
                        If first our Hearts to Mercy true encline,
                        Good Words & Works from thence as true Effects will shine.
                     
                     
                        17
                        For in the heart of Man is Mercies Throne,
                        The Subiect, where true Mercy doth abide,
                        All streames of Mercy that from thence doe flowne,
                        Are as the Fountaynes pure from which they slide,
                        Then like Gods Mercy they doe spread out wide,
                        First, feeding Soules that pine for heau'nly Food,
                        Next for the Poore and Hungrie they prouide,
                        For all in Neede that of our helpe haue stood,
                        And like to Widdowes Oile encrease by doing good.
                     
                     
                        18
                        Then we them truely workes of Mercy call,
                        When from vnfayned Mercy they proceede:
                        For sure it is the Heart that seasons all,
                        Which maketh mercifull in word and deede.
                        Thus we releeue the Poore that are in neede,
                        And Widdowes, Orphanes, Strangers, entertayne;
                        We clothe the Naked, and the Hungrie feede,
                        Visit the Sicke, the Captiues that remayne
                        In bonds, we loose: And comfort those that mourne in payne.
                     
                     
                        19
                        Though all the Vertues of Loues Royall Court
                        Delight to keepe sweet Mercy companie,
                        As Patience, Iustice, Faith, Hope, good Report,
                        Repentance, Meeknesse, Truth, Ioy, Chastitie;
                        Yet shee delights most in Humilitie,
                        Vnseparable Adjunct of this Peere,
                        With whom shee workes all deeds of Charitie,
                        Those which our Hearts from Sinne doe purge and cleere,
                        And those whereby the Needie we doe succour heere.
                     
                     
                        
                        20
                        By her is daily great prouision made
                        For Blind, Old, Lame, all People that are poore,
                        Not those that doe of begging make a Trade,
                        And loosely idle walke from dore to dore,
                        A worke of Mercy shee it deemes to gore
                        Such Vagabonds: their Passe with blood to seale,
                        Vnfruitfull Vermine that consume our store,
                        The Catterpillers of our Common-weale,
                        Which to maintayne base ease, and lust, begge, lie, and steale.
                     
                     
                        21
                        But shee, directed by Humilitie,
                        Into deepe stinking Dungeons will descend,
                        To visit captiu'd thralls in miserie,
                        And them instruct in wayes of Truth to wend,
                        Exhorting them their bad liues to amend;
                        If any for well-doing bound doe lie,
                        Shee for His ransome her estate will spend,
                        All Malefactors wants Shee doth supply,
                        For well shee knowes Christ did for Malefactors die.
                     
                     
                        22
                        Shee next like Lot and Abram entertaynes
                        Strangers all Day, at Noone, and eke at Night:
                        Not that shee hopes from them least gold or gaynes,
                        Or that with double mends they will requite:
                        But those which harbour want shee doth inuite
                        Humbly to Meate, and Drinke, and Lodging meete,
                        Where shee to wait vpon them takes delight,

                        All wickednesse abundantly doth flow,
                        So from a Heart of Mercy doth distill,

                        To shew the nature of this Grace Diuine;
                        Since earthly things, to Her, all shadowes be.
                        Thy Mercy, Lord, no where so cleare doth shine,
                        As sending of that blessed Sonne of thine:
                        Vnspotted Lambe, slaine from Eternitie,
                        To saue all that their hearts to him incline,
                        From Hell, Death, Bale, and endlesse Miserie:
                        This Mercy is without all like or paritie.

                        Here will I striue to cleare the difference
                        That I of Loue and Mercy doe conceiue.
                        To other each haue so neare reference,
                        That we one for another oft receiue:
                        Gods Loue vpon th'Elect doth onely cleaue,
                        Mercy on them in Miserie that lie.
                        Till Satan our first Parents did deceiue,
                        God them embrac'd in Loue and Charitie;
                        No Mercy needed them that felt no Miserie.
                     
                     
                        45
                        Gods Loue doth most in our Creation shine,
                        In our Election, and Predestination:
                        But his great Mercy seemes to draw her line
                        From our Redemption and Iustification:
                        Not that I hence exclude Loues operation,
                        For Loue is as the Prince and Soueraigne,
                        Of all the Graces needfull to saluation;
                        And Mercy is the chiefest of her traine,
                        And seemes in Mans Redemption like her Queene to raigne.

                        For Vertue and for Learning high doth stand,
                        And next to him obtaynes the second place,
                        And chiefest gouernement of all the Land,
                        In Court of Mercy doth eu'n counter-mand

                        But when we Mercy shew to any thing:
                        We seldome Mercy of that thing desire,
                        Mercy stil downward goes, Loue most what mounteth higher.

                        Is one with Mercy, and is by translation
                        
                           A miserable Heart, or piteous inclination.

                        And to them ministred best remedies,
                        And oft with teares bewayled our infirmities.

                        And succour those that are in miserie,
                        That we by all meanes doe auoid to know
                        Their wants, that are in woe and pouertie,
                        When as indeed to see calamitie
                        Of others, doth Mans heart to pitie moue.
                        We swimme in Plentie and Prosperitie,
                        Regarding not what hardnesse others proue,
                        And farre the sight or thought of wretchednesse remoue.

                        Our Captayne did not thus that went before,
                        But in much anguish, paine, and tribulation
                        Conuerted Soules, heal'd Sicke, releeu'd the Poore,
                        Himselfe without a house for habitation,
                        In workes of Mercy was his conuersation,
                        What Member suff'red, and he did not grone?
                        Where saw he want and shewed not compassion?
                        What? did our Head this by himselfe alone?
                        No, His Apostles all with him in this haue gone.
                     
                     
                        61
                        Oh, that we would in this Him imitate,
                        And Mercy eu'n with open Armes embrace
                        With our whole heart, strength, substance and estate,
                        Aide and releeue the Poore in wretched case;
                        'Tis not a pitious heart that makes men base:
                        For they that are most valiant, noble, wise,
                        Most readie are Mercy to shew and Grace,
                        When Cruelty's the badge of Cowardize:

                        And in abundance daily Bread afford,

                        Yet to his Members all he doth require,

                        And succour those that are in miserie:
                        For though his worldly substance ebbe so low,
                        He seemes to liue in want and penurie;
                        Yet may he lend Diuine sweet remedie
                        To those that doe in Hell and Darknesse sit,
                        And heau'nly comforts to their Soule apply,
                        Whom Conscience throwes into th' infernall Pit.

                        And we may know farre greater doth abound
                        With God, who's not more willing to releeue
                        Than able, all things needfull vs to giue,
                        Besides, in Mercy he doth take delight,

                        That doe relie vpon his Truth and Might,
                        And on his gracious Prouidence doe rest aright.

                        Thou as an vpright Iudge wilt then appeare,
                        And render eu'ry Man as he hath done:

                        Beene swallowed vp of Hell and Desperation,
                        Thy Mercy that begun, must finish our Saluation.

                        4
                        For so the Learned seeme to giue the Sense,
                        This preparation of the Gospels Peace,
                        To be the brasen Bootes of Patience,
                        Which doth defend from Thornes and Stones disease
                        Our Legs and Feete: And where the Belt doth cease,
                        These Bootes of Patience Armour doe supply,
                        By which in complete Armour we doe prease,
                        And stand vndanted 'gainst our Enemie;
                        This Vertue is the next my Muse seekes to descrie.
                     
                     
                        5
                        Which well is call'd the Gospels preparation;
                        For neuer any Patience true and sound
                        Can be, but by the Gospels mediation.
                        The Heathen built not on this certayne ground,
                        And therefore this true Patience neuer found,
                        Which but by Peace of Conscience none attayne:
                        This Peace the Gospell onely doth propound

                        Thou glorious God of Peace and Patience,
                        (Who sent'st thine onely Sonne our sinnes to beare,
                        And by his Suffring and Obedience

                        All those to whom his Crosse is sweet and deare)
                        Direct my Muse this Grace aright to reade,
                        That knowing, I may neuer once forbeare
                        To practise Patience in thought, word, deede,
                        But to the end my Life in Peace and Patience leade.
                     
                     
                        7
                        Which is a gift of God, whereby weare
                        Inabled willingly and constantly
                        All crosses that God layes on vs, to beare,
                        For Goodnesse, Godlinesse, and Honestie.
                        Impatience 'tis to beare vnwillingly,
                        And but an idle feigned false pretence,
                        To boast of Vertue without Constancie:
                        Her parts be foure; of which some difference
                        May seeme at first, yet all make but one Patience.
                     
                     
                        
                        8
                        The first part is, from Anger to abstayne;
                        The second is a constant Expectation;
                        The third is, to the end Right to remayne;
                        The last consists in willing Sustentation
                        Of all afflictions here, and castigation.
                        But Man to these foure parts we onely tie:
                        For the last part, which doth consist in Passion
                              •
                           
                        
                        Vnto th' eternall Being comes not nigh,
                        Who's free from all Affliction and Calamitie.
                     
                     
                        9
                        Yet is he rightly call'd the Patient God,
                        And doth in first three named parts transcend:
                        First, farre from Anger, when he spares his Rod,
                        He doth expect and wait till we amend:
                        And last, abides the same vnto the end:
                        He fruitfull Times and Seasons of the Yeare
                        Vnto the good and bad alike doth send;
                        Most patiently doth with our Follies beare,
                        And where he 'gins to loue, he neuer doth forbeare.
                     
                     
                        10
                        Thus Mercy, Zeale, Repentance, may be said
                        Inexplicably in God to bee;
                        Zealous, yet not offended or dismaid:
                        Most Mercifull, yet griefe did neuer see:
                        Repenting, yet without remorse is hee:
                        Most Patient, yet without least payne or passion.
                        Of Vertues parts, which are of Frailtee
                        And Weaknesse, God hath no participation,
                        Yet want they not in Man their vse and commendation.
                     
                     
                        11
                        As is the Cause and End of Patience,
                        So we her true or counterfet esteeme;
                        The Cause and End doe make the difference:
                        If we for Fancy, Glorie, Lust, Wealth, seeme
                        To beare with Patience, Hunger, Payne, Cold, Teene;
                        This suffring, missing her true Cause and End,
                        As falsely feigned, counterfet we deeme:
                        But if for doing well, or to defend
                        The Truth we suffer, this our Patience doth commend.

                        Loe, there we carnall Ends and Causes name.
                        True Patience causes, honest are and iust,
                        When for ill-doing we doe suffer blame.
                        Take paine for Glorie, Honour, Gayne, or Lust,
                        Rewards like to the Cause and End expect we must.
                     
                     
                        13
                        But true immediate ground of Patience
                        Is the sweet Gospell (as I said) of Peace:
                        For Man, deepe plung'd in sinne and foule offence,

                        In stead of Loue, Gods wrath on Man did seise,
                        Till Christ concludes our Reconciliation,
                        And vs of our offences doth release,
                        Of which the Gospell is th' A

                        14
                        And therefore as her Cause and End is Peace,
                        So all her works to inward Peace doe tend,
                        Which in the inward Man doth most increase,

                        Then Patience true doth patiently forbeare,

                        As cannot stand right with her Conscience.
                        Shee priuate wrongs most willingly doth hide,
                        But faults admitteth vnder no pretence.
                        Shee can endure Men should her selfe deride:

                        Afflictions are her Obiects, which we find

                        Which Mind and Body dang'rously infest.
                        Against these, Patience is alwayes prest,
                        And them as well-come Friends doth entertaine:
                        More crosses shee endures, more shee is blest,

                        Than Patience, more fast and firme maintayne?
                        Who keepes true Friends from discord, iarre, and strife,

                        Thus Patience preserues all Peace begun by Loue.
                     
                     
                        22
                        None can ascend to glorious Court of Loue,
                        But he must clime by Patience, beare with payne;

                        First shew'd in Garden in Mans innocence;
                        Whilst he in Makers Grace and Fauour stood:
                        For when the Serpents base impatient mood
                        Mans glorie in Gods Image could not beare,
                        He them seduc'd to eate forbidden food,
                        Whereby our Blessings chang'd to Curses were,

                        Since this these two doe worke by contrarie,
                        By Patience we our Soules possessen here,
                        And we them lose by our Impatiency:
                        One heares sound Doctrine; th' other stops her eare.
                        One suffers all; the other nought will beare.
                        For Loue, Christ, Godlinesse, or Honestie,
                        By Patience more than Conquerors we are:
                        Impatience makes vs cowardly to flie;
                        True Patience, brings all Grace; all Vice, Impatiencie.

                        The meekest Moses did stone Tables cleaue,
                        When Zeale of Gods great Glorie did his sense bereaue.

                        How patiently did holy Dauid beare
                        
                           Sauls persecutions, wayting for his Crowne?

                        Yet would not let Abisai smite him downe.
                        But none for Patience like to Iob is knowne:
                        Loe, Christ himselfe the Patience doth commend
                        That Prophets, Priests, and Martyrs haue vs showne,

                        Haue without grudging held out constant to the end.
                     
                     
                        42
                        All wrestled in this Field of Patience:
                        Some scornes, stripes, fetters, prisonment sustayne:
                        Some racking, sawing, broyling, banishments;
                        Some scourg'd with rods, with sword some haue bin slayne:
                        In Sheepe skins, Goate skins, some to walke were fayne,
                        Of which the World in no wise worthy were,

                        Should I the praise of Patience them denie:
                        So many for the Truth with constant mind,
                        In flames of fire haue let their body frie:

                        O blessed Maid, what griefe did thee betide,
                        To see thy Sonne on Crosse his Armes to open wide?

                        With multitude of Paternes from without;
                        Since onely inward Patience can vs blesse,

                        Whilst patiently we here all crosses beare,
                        To th' end with Christian courage holding out,
                        And neuer Mans pride or Hells malice feare,

                        45
                        We reade that Socrates did Patience gayne
                        By patient bearing his impatient Wife:
                        And we this Grace by suffring may attayne,
                        If in Faith, Hope, and good Workes we be rife.
                        Doubtlesse our paynes here, crosses, griefe, and strife,
                        Are nothing if they rightly be compar'd
                        Vnto the Ioyes, Crownes, and eternall Life,
                        Which God aboue for all those hath prepar'd,
                        That with true Patience of his comming haue regard.

                        But ah, we of farre other spirit are,
                        In our hot blood we cut off Malchus eare;
                        But if our liues be question'd, then we dare
                        The Truth denie, and eu'n our Christ forsweare.
                        Mans mind possest with furie or with feare,
                        Falls from the meane to all extremitie:
                        For want of courage he no crosse can beare,
                        Or for reuenge doth offer iniurie,
                        Both which alike are guiltie of Impatiencie.

                        The more I suffer here, the more's my gayne;
                        The greater losse, the greater recompence.
                        Ah, this to flesh and blood is sore offence,

                        Flesh, World, and Deuill thee will seeke to chace,

                        When entrance was at Citie Gates withstood,
                        Because their Faces towards Sion stood;
                        Shall we Elias-like from Heau'n fire craue,
                        For to consume this base rebellious brood?
                        To whom Christ said, Know yee what Spirits yee haue
                        I came not hither to destroy and spoile, but saue.

                        Lord grant me Pauls true constant resolution,
                        Not onely for thy Names sake to be bound,
                        But willingly to suffer dissolution.
                        Some scortching flames like beds of downe haue found,
                        In some such inward comfort did abound,
                        When as they suffred for Christs holy Name,
                        For signe of inward ioy and comfort found,
                        Their hands they lift vp to expresse the same,
                        Till they consumed were eu'n by the scortching flame.
                     
                     
                        
                        52
                        It was th'Apostles triumph and delight,
                        To be accounted worthy for Christs sake
                        To suffer scourging, prison, shame, despite,
                        Which did them way to Crownes and Glorie make:
                        More happy 'tis to suffer at a stake
                        For Truth, than end our dayes in ease and rest:
                        
                           Paul for a wondrous fauour did it take,
                        That he not onely to beleeue was blest,
                        But that he suffered more for Christ than all the rest.

                        Yet he with constant Patience conquered them all.
                     
                     
                        54
                        So they that truely loue, will ought endure
                        For his sake onely they so truely loue.
                        Lord grant me Loue, for then I may be sure,
                        In all afflictions patient to proue:
                        No power of Men or Hell their soules can moue,
                        That build vpon so good and strong foundation,
                        Temptation may vs shake but not remoue
                        From Loue, the ground and pillar of saluation,
                        Loue is the Cause of ours, as of our Sauiours passion.
                     
                     
                        55
                        This seasons all afflictions, crosses, payne,
                        Makes Death our Gate to Heau'n; the Graue, our rest.
                        This makes our Patience perfect, and doth gayue
                        Vs Heau'n as sure, as if we were possest.
                        The God of Patience be euer blest,
                        The End and Authour of my Meditation,
                        And grant I constantly may euer rest
                        Vpon his Loue in Christ, my sure foundation,
                        Whose Patience paid my price of Reconciliation.

                        Thus of true Patience hauing laid the ground,
                        I thereon Christian Fortitude will raise:
                        For neuer any valour true and sound
                        Can well abide, but where true Patience stayes.
                        No perill, payne, or shame that soule dismayes,
                        Where these two Vertues doe themselues combine,
                        Both ioyfull make vs walke through dreadfull wayes,
                        And like two Sunnes in Firmament doe shine;
                        Most glorious Fortitude: but Patience most Diuine.

                        I therefore her, Loues valiant Generall,
                        And chiefe Commandresse of her Forces name;
                        For that the most braue Sp'rits heroicall,
                        Haue alwayes beene most honour'd by the same;
                        Amongst the Heathen men, that sought vaine Fame,
                        This Vertue was in such great estimation,
                        Of heau'nly Seede they thought their Heros came,
                        Expecting not from humane propagation
                        Such worth: except the Gods concurr'd in Generation.
                     
                     
                        3
                        And therefore those, whose valour did transcend
                        The ordinarie reach of humane Race,
                        By Pedigrees are lin'd out to descend
                        From Ioues, or some great Deities embrace:
                        Thus in a mist they seeme the Truth to trace,
                        For Vertues all (but chiefly Fortitude)
                        Are not begotten, but infus'd by Grace,
                        And in Kings hearts in larger amplitude,
                        As they it more doe neede than common multitude.
                     
                     
                        
                        4
                        For as small Waters faire and goodly seeme,
                        When little Channels doe their course maintayne,
                        Yet would a Man them scarsely Waters deeme,
                        If they ran drissing in some Riuer mayne:
                        Eu'n so a Subiects heart, that doth contayne
                        True Fortitude, but in a measure small,
                        Great glorie to himselfe thereby may gayne,
                        But if in Princes heart the same should fall,
                        It scarsely would be counted Fortitude at all.
                     
                     
                        5
                        Wherefore, the Hearts of Kings are said to bee
                        Like mightie Riuers in th'Almighties hand,
                        From which as from a little Ocean, hee
                        Disposeth Water ouer all the Land:

                        Refresh and water eu'ry Dale and Plaine,
                        As from their Soueraigne they haue command,
                        But all their Waters haue from Ocean maine,

                        6
                        And therefore since I find it all but vaine
                        To seeke for any good and perfect Grace,
                        But from the bountie of my Soueraigne,
                        I here beseech th' Almightie guide my trace,
                        In finding out this Vertues royal Race,
                        That I her wondrous Glorie may expresse
                        So here, as all may striue her to embrace,
                        As th'onely strength of humane happinesse,
                        Till with Loues gracious Trayne shee bring vs vnto blesse.

                        And Patience mitigates the know of our passion.
                     
                     
                        
                        8
                        Patience is past, and Meeknesse comes behind,
                        I therefore Fortitude here twofold name,
                        One of the Body, th'other of the Mind:
                        This Fortitude of Body is the same
                        We common haue with Beasts both wild and tame,
                        Encreast by feeding, strength, good constitution;
                        In stout sustayning is her greatest fame,
                        Next in on-setting with braue resolution:
                        This helps in Warre, but minds it best in persecution.
                     
                     
                        9
                        I twofold likewise call that of the Mind,
                        One true, the other that which men doe fayne,
                        When for false ends we nobly are enclin'd,
                        Or when these Causes following constrayne;
                        Passion, Experience, Ignorance, Art, Gayne,

                        By Ignorance, and for Gayne we boldly Life endanger.

                        The Coward faint will like a Dragon fight;
                        Who can withstand the furie of the Base?
                        Experience, Art preuaile oft against might;
                        And Ignorance of danger doth incite
                        The fearefull, great atchieuements to aduenter,
                        Custome of winning makes vs oft in spite

                        But Fortitude, which doth prepare the Mind
                        For God and Goodnesse chearefully to die,
                        Is that braue Vertue formerly defin'd,
                        Which Death nor Hell it selfe can terrifie:

                        Put on our armes to fight most valiantly,
                        Faith, Hope, and Truth, with Patience, Iustice Right,

                        When he Goliah met in single fight;
                        Yet, if Gods power we consider right,
                        And set by all the worldly strength we haue,
                        Relying on his prouidence and might,
                        As Dauid, we may say, with courage braue,

                        For from the Lord is all sufficiency,
                        Our Enemies in Christ we nothing feare,
                        But fight Gods Battailes most couragiously,
                        In whom we able to doe all things are:
                        And as he shame endur'd and crosse did beare,
                        So Souldiers of our valiant Generall,
                        We with vndanted resolution dare

                        And by the Fleshes weaknesse most doth thriue,

                        This most heroike Vertue: 'Tis not place,

                        Wherewith th' Almightie hath thy brest indude;
                        Or tell the courage of thy valiant Sonne
                        Our Prince; which stretcheth to such amplitude,
                        That had my Song with his great Praise begun,
                        My Life on Earth had ended ere my Muse had done.
                     
                     
                        
                        40
                        But we returne to Fortitude within,
                        By which we fight 'gainst spirituall enemies,
                        World, Deuill, Flesh, and our originall Sinne,
                        Hell, Empires, Powers, Principalities,
                        To our spirituall Peace all enmities:
                        Against these, for our safegard, we embrace
                        All spirituall Graces, as sure remedies;
                        Ah! how dare they looke Satan in the face,
                        That are quite destitute of all true sauing Grace?
                     
                     
                        41
                        Alas! What strength haue they then that depend
                        Vpon the Pope and his Supremacie,
                        Or hope his holy Water can defend
                        Them from this strong and subtile enemie:
                        Saints Reliques, Bulls, Beades, and such trumperie,
                        Are now the onely weapons they must weare;
                        Their Agnus Deies doe so terrifie
                        The Deuill, and away ill spirits scare,
                        For other spirituall Armour, now they neede not care.
                     
                     
                        42
                        How hope they to be able to withstand
                        The Serpents malice, and the Worlds despite,
                        Who lay by Armes, and loose and idle stand,
                        Not buckeling themselues vnto the fight?
                        As Armes were, like apparell, for delight,
                        Or for sport onely, and a glittering show,
                        These fainting hearts that are afraid to fight,
                        Vaine Fooles that neuer yet Hels strength did know,
                        Which at the first encounter them will ouerthrow.
                     
                     
                        43
                        Alas! eu'n too too many now a dayes,
                        Like Gallants of our time, make goodly show
                        In glitt'ring Armes, and bragge great might in Frayes;
                        But come where danger to their life may grow,
                        They then away both Armes and Weapons throw.
                        Thus they abuse the knowledge God doth lend,
                        Vnto their ruine and their ouerthrow,
                        Wanting true valour Truth for to defend,
                        And Christian Fortitude, to hold out to the End.
                     
                     
                        
                        44
                        My onely wish is, euer to be strong
                        In God and in the power of his Might,
                        Casting off all things that doe not belong
                        Vnto the Christian Battaile I must fight:
                        Oh! who in warres can serue his Prince aright,
                        That doth himselfe with Worlds affaires entangle?
                        With spirituall Weapons we maintayne this fight,
                        And not with cunning at the Barre to jangle,
                        We here must fight for Life, and not for profit wrangle.
                     
                     
                        45
                        I here confesse mine inward strength is vaine,
                        Vnable to withstand such enemies,
                        That I to seeke out of my selfe am faine,
                        For helpe against Hels powr's and policies;
                        So many are my knowne infirmities,
                        I mine owne strength doe vtterly distrust,
                        Hoping thy Grace, that all our wants supplies,
                        Will strengthen me against Hell, Sinne, and Lust,
                        Since in no finite Power, but infinite I trust.
                     
                     
                        46
                        Oh, grant me firme on thine Omnipotence,
                        In crosses and afflictions to relie,
                        And wholy to renounce all confidence,
                        Mans strength, or hope in Princes, can supply:
                        Who, vnder shadow of thy Wings doe lie,
                        No forraine Power, nor inward dread need feare,
                        Thy strength is most seene in infirmitie,
                        In thee wee able to doe all things are,
                        By force of thy great Might we all aduenture dare.
                     
                     
                        47
                        God is my Refuge, Strength and Fortitude,
                        My Rocke, Shield, Buckler, and in whom I trust,
                        Who hath my Foes all vnto me subdu'd,
                        Making our Enemies to licke the dust.
                        Most firme defence vnto the Meeke and Iust;
                        All superstitious vanities are vaine,
                        Who put in God their confidence and trust,
                        Firme, stable, sure, like Sions Mount remayne,
                        No powres of Hell can snake where this foundation's layne.
                     
                     
                        
                        50
                        Great is the Power wherein we doe trust,
                        A mightie Power and exceeding strong,
                        Able to raise our Bodies from the dust,
                        And to Eternitie our life prolong:
                        All pow'r from God, to God all doth belong,
                        Why then should'st thou my Soule distrust or quaile?
                        On him relie, and none can doe thee wrong:
                        Thine Heart and Conscience Satan may assaile,
                        But by Gods helpe, thou shalt against them all preuaile.
                     
                     
                        51
                        So by this mightie Power we shall at length
                        Be Victors, though Sinne seeme vs here to foile:
                        Lord, grant me this spirituall Pow'r and Strength,
                        That though my Body suffer here a while,
                        And like a Coward oft doth take the foile;
                        I may with courage so my Soule defend,
                        No Power me of spirituall Armes despoile.
                        Lord, grant I practise may, what I commend,
                        So I, with prayse my Booke and Meditation end.
                     
                     
                        52
                        Thus as one of the Bridegromes meanest Friends,
                        I to adorne the Bride doe offer here
                        These Ornaments: The gift no worth commends,
                        But He to whom the Widdowes mite was deare,
                        Because shee all her substance offred there,
                        Will well accept of this poore Offering,
                        That when I shall at that great day appeare
                        Before the Iudge, to giue my reckoning,
                        This time may be allow'd me for Gods honouring.
                     
                     FINIS.

                  A FVNERALL
ELEGIE,
Consecrated to the memorie of his euerhonoured
Lord,
IOHN KING,
Late Lord Bishop of London.
                  LEt others call their Muse to helpe them mourne,
                  And books of Tragique Scenes and Stories turne:
                  My Heart abundant matter shall indite,
                  If but the halfe (I of my sorrow) write.
                  Were it a priuate losse of mine alone,
                  I could it smother with a priuate grone:
                  But ah! I ring my Fathers Fathers knell,
                  
                  The Charet and Horsemen of Israel.
                  Happy Elisha, when the fiery Horse
                  And Charets thee did from thy Master force!
                  Whilst he in Whirlewind vp to Heauen ascends,
                  His Spirit doubled downe on thee descends:
                  But ah! I haue no Spirit but to mourne,
                  And wash with teares this sacred Fathers Vrne,

                      is not left me to diuide
                  Mine Eyes from Teares, as Iordanes floods were dride.
                  Yet had I but his Spirit here to tell,
                  How stoutly he opposed Iezabel,
                  
                  And all her Baalling superstitious crew
                  Of Prophets, and their Idols ouerthrew,
                  How firmely he in his Religion stood,
                  Readie till Death to seale it with his blood,
                  
                  Without least Bastard thought to change that Truth,
                  Which was in him firme, rooted from his youth;
                  I then might ius

                     ly hope my feeble Verse
                  Had done full right vnto thy wronged Herse,
                  For I should muzzell those that wrong thy fame
                  And die them, like their whoare, scarlet in shame,
                  Should force into their face that modest blood,
                  That left them, ere since they left Truth and Good.
                  Yet why should I thinke much that Calumnie,
                  Labours to cloud thy Names bright memorie,
                  Since that Iust One, thy Sauiour, after Death
                  Could not auoid Slanders envenom'd breath?
                  And if thy Lord and Masters fate were such,
                  Let not thy Ashes grieue to beare as much.
                  Oh sacred Spirit enclos'd in frailest mold
                  Of britle Clay! when I did thee behold
                  Praying Elias-like; thou couldst constrayne
                  The Heau'ns to water all the Earth with rayne.
                  And when thy zealous tongue touch'd with the flame

                  Thou like to Paul or Peter didst diuine,
                  Three thousand Soules conuerting at a time.
                  When thou didst sit on Iustice sacred Throne,
                  Thy Prudence shin'd like that of Solomon,
                  
                  
                     And Samuel-like so equall didst diuide,
                  Thou often gau'st content to either side.
                  Like Aristotles thy Schole Disputations,
                  
                  Thy Speeches Tullies eloquent Orations,
                  
                  Thy Lectures all Ideas most diuine,
                  Where Arts like Starres in Firmament doe shine.

                  Thou Dauid-like didst to th' Almightie sweare,
                  No wicked riotous Person should come there.

                  Most happy Man, if Vertue, Honour, Right,
                  
                  Or any worldly Blisse make happy wight,
                  Home, and abroad honour'd, belou'd and fear'd,
                  Him Grace and Learning vnto all endear'd.
                  But oh! what Mortall stands so sure and fast,
                  That here may be call'd happy, till his last?
                  
                  To whom the People erst Hosanna cride,
                  When he in triumph doth through Sion ride,
                  Ere many dayes was on the Crosse so shaken,
                  As if he fear'd himselfe of God forsaken:
                  
                     So when this Saint (like Paul the 
                        
                           •
                        ged) sung
                  To build vp Sions ruines with his Tongue,
                  The rauish'd Hearers with thy message strooke,
                  Sate as they had no powr's, but Eare and Looke,
                  Both which did yeeld thy Worth such loud applause,
                  As if an Angels Trump had lent thee voyce,
                  I thinke their strict attention did fore-see,
                  They neuer more should heare so much from thee.
                  A Swan-like Dittie, for it was his last,
                  For ere the Sunne had round his circuit past,
                  He that for Sions building vp did pray,
                  Did in his owne fraile Temple feele decay!
                  My Soule eu'n trembles but thy groanes to heare:
                  Alas! how couldst thou them with Patience beare
                  Afflictions, which would breake a brasen Wall,
                  And hardest Milstone grin'd to powder small,
                  But Hee in Heau'n that heard thee groane and weepe,
                  And all thy teares did in his Bottle keepe,
                  When it was full, doth take of thee compassion,
                  And freed thee from thy paynes and bitter passion.
                  Eu'n on that Day whereon we celebrate
                  His Passion, whom thou liu'dst to imitate;
                  Loe, God doth millions of his Angels send,
                  Thy sorrowes here with heau'nly Ioyes to end.
                  Shall we bewaile thy happy commutation,
                  Now chang'd from Earth to heau'nly Habitation?
                  Where as thy Ioyes the Angels farre surpast,
                  Which neuer of thy Miseries did taste,
                  For there thou dost that Psalme of comfort ring,
                  Which none but Saints afflicted here can sing;
                  That Ioy which neuer had in Heau'n beene knowne,
                  But by those Saints that vnder crosses groane:
                  
                     That Ioy, which feeles God comfort vs againe,
                  After he hath vs plagu'd on Earth with paine;
                  And for a few yeares of aduersitie,
                  Rewards in Heau'n with Ioyes eternitie;
                  Which giues for Sorrow, Ioy; for Labour, Rest;
                  A Hau'n to vs whom Shipwracke erst distrest:
                  From Danger, Safetie; Light vnto the eye,
                  Long blind in Dungeons obscuritie.
                  Life after Death doth make our liues more sweet,
                  Who here Christs plentifull afflictions meet.
                  Shall haue in him a plenteous consolation:
                  Then let vs all, that wait for like saluation,
                  In Body like this Saint the dying beare
                  Of's dying Lord; and let him neuer feare
                  But his Lords life shall be made manifest
                  In Him, when He our Labour turnes to Rest.
                  But more: my Muse is as vnfit to write
                  As are my sorrowes stupid to endite!
                  Onely, Shee thus the publique losse bemones,
                  And what Shee wants in words, supplyes with grones.
