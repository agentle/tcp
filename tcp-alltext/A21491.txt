               es, kepynge of the foure offryng days, paiment of tythes, accordyng to the olde cuſtome of the realme, and al other lyke laudable ceremonies heretofore vſed in the church of England, whyche as yet be not abolyſhed nor taken away by his hyghneſſe, ſo as they ſhall vſe without ſuperſtition, HIS MAIESTIE, for the tender zeale, whiche his highnes hath borne, to the good inſtruction of his people in truthe, and being deſyrous, that the ſayde ceremonyes ſhulde be obſerued and vſed in theyr ryghte vſe (all ignoraunce and ſuperſtition clerely taken awaye, ſtraytely chargeth and commaundeth, that in ſuche places, and all ſuche dayes as the ſayde ceremonyes ſhall be chiefely celebrate, the byſhoppe, deane, curate, or paryſhe prieſte, for that tyme the myniſter, ſhall trewly and playnely inſtructe the people, the good and right vſe and effectes of ſuche ceremonie, as is vſed that daye, by whiche knowlege, the people ſo vſynge and obſeruynge the ſame ceremonye, maye be fruitfully edified in renuynge and ſtyrynge vp ſpirituall cogitations and godly thoughtes of ſuch thynges, as thoſe ceremonyes wel vnderſtanded, were ordeyned to preache vnto vs. Wherfore euery ſonday it ſhall be declared, howe holy water is ſprinkled, to put vs in remembrance of our baptiſme, and of the bloud of Chriſt, ſprinkled for oure redemption vpon the croſſe: And that gyuynge of holy breade is, to put vs in remembraunce of vnitie, that all chriſten men be one myſticall body of CHRISTE, as the breadde is made of many graynes, and to put vs alſo in remembraunce of the howſell, whiche in the begynnynge of Chriſtis churche men dyd oftener receyue, than they vſe nowe to doo.
            
               ON CANDELMAS DAYE it ſhall be declared, that the bearynge of Candels is done in the memorie of Chriſte, the ſpirituall lyghte, of whom Simeon dyd prophecye, as it is redde in the churche that daye.
            
               ON ASHE VVENISDAY it ſhall be declared, that theſe aſhes be gyuen, to put euery chriſten man in remembraunce of penaunce at the begynnynge of Lent, and that he is but erthe and aſſhes.
            
               ON PALMESONDAY IT ſhall be declared, that bearynge of palmes renueth the memorie of the receiuynge of Chriſte, in lyke maner into Ieruſalem before his deathe.
            
               ON GOOD FRIDAY IT ſhall be declared, howe crepynge of the croſſe, ſygnyfieth an humblynge of oure ſelfe to Chriſte, before the croſſe, and the kyſſynge of it a memorie of our redemption, made vpon the croſſe. And at foure tymes in the yere at the leſte, to declare the ſygnification of the other ceremonyes.
            
               AND SO it ſhalbe well vnderſtanden and knowen, that neyther holy breade, nor holy water, candels, bowes, nor aſhes halowed, or crepynge and kyſſynge the croſſe, be the workers or workes of our ſaluation, but onely be as outwarde ſignes and tokens, wherby we remembre Chriſte and his doctrine, his workes and his paſſion, from whens all good chriſten men receyue ſaluation, whiche is the vndoubted Truthe and the ſyncere vnderſtandynge of the catholyke doctrine. And as the worde dothe no good to hym that abuſeth it, nor worthilye receyueth it, ſo is not the ceremony fruitefull to hym, that wolde ſuperſtitiouſely abuſe it, or by his owne malyce withſtande the good vſe of it: wherin euery mans faulte ſhall worke his owne detrymente. And to the hole body it ſhall be greatly profytable, eche one to ſe other, and all togither to ſee the hole congregation vnder the kynges maieſties gouernaunce, ſo to profeſſe and outwardly to declare a louynge and charytable obedience, as all inſtructed by one true doctrine, ſette forthe by his maieſtie, and in their hartes conſentynge to the ſame, do lykewyſe in their ſeueral actes and maners, in their preachynges and teachynges, theyr wordes and writynges, and ioyntely together with theyr deuoute behauoure in rites and ceremonyes laudable, and by the kynges maieſtie approued, make euydent demonſtration of a concorde and agrement, in one god, one redemer, one ſpirite, one teachyng, with an humble and meke harte to be obedient to one gouernour, and ruler, the kynges moſt excellent maieſtie, ſupreme heed of the churche of Englande, alwayes ſubmyttyng theyr iugementes, and ſhewyng them ſelfe redy and gladly to obey that, whyche for the tyme ſhall be by his hyghnes commaunded.
            
               AND THERFORE his maieſtie, hauyng thus, as aboue is declared, taken ordre, how to haue his people taught the ryght vſe and vnderſtandynge of rytes and cerymonyes, lyke as his grace dyd in the foreſayd proclamation, made in Nouembre laſte paſt, ſtraytly charge and commaunde his people, to obſerue the rytes and ceremonyes aforeſayde: So nowe eftſones his hyghnes chargeth and commandeth all and ſynguler his louynge ſubiectes, and all other reſiauntes within this his gracis realme, to obſerue and kepe all and ſyngular the rytes and cemonyes afore mentioned, and all ſuche other lyke, as haue ben laudably accuſtomed in the churche of Englande, not yet abolyſhed, ſo longe, and vnto ſuche tyme as the ſame rites and ceremonyes, or any of them, ſhal by his hyghnes be taken awaye or altered. And that in the meane ſeaſon none of his highnes ſubiectes, nor other reſiaunte within this his highneſſe realme, doo neyther by dede worde ne behauyour deſpice theſe ceremonyes afore mencioned, nor ſuperſticiouſly abuſe them, nor any of them, as they woll auoyde his maieſties moſte greuouſe indignation and diſpleaſure.
