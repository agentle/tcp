                  IAMES be the grace of God King of Scottis, To our Louittis William Bryſon Maſar, Meſſingeris our
Schireffis in that part coniunetly and ſeuerallie ſpeciallie conſtitute greting. Forſamekle as it is not vnknawin
to all the gude ſubiectis of this our Realme, quhat greit gude will and freindſchip our deareſt ſiſter the Quene
of Ingland (being Princeſſe in the warld neireſt to vs baith be blude and habitatioun) hes declarit not onlie
towarris vs and the preſeruatioū of our Innocent perſoun euer ſen our birth. Bot als quhat cair, trauellis, and
charges our ſaid deareſt ſiſter hes takin, borne, and ſuſtenit for the ſaiſtie and preſeruatioun of this our Realme in the auld
ancient libertie, far aboue the cuſtome of ony hir predeceſſouris. For it is not to be forgottin bot thankfullie to be rememberit
how euin with the beginning of hir Regne (were than ſtāding betuix thir twa Realmes) firſt of all a godlie peace was maid
and concludit, quhilk to this tyme hes happely continewit to the pleaſure of God and greit commoditie of this countrie. As
alſwa how ſchortlie thairefter this our Realme being in danger of the Frenche conqueiſt, and Chriſtiane Religioun thairin
likly to haue bene vtterly ſuppreſſit, be our ſaid deareſt ſiſteris forces and ayd ſend to the aſſege of Leyth, the ſtrangeris wer
expellit and the ſtait of Religioun and libertie of the coūtrie preſeruit, in the quhilk actioun neither hir treaſure nor the blude
and lyfis of hir pepill wer ſpairit. The lyke cair weill appeirit in hir quhen be hir forces direct in this our Realme in the Moneth
of Maij, the ȝeir of God ane thouſand fyue hundreth thre ſcoir and ten ȝeiris, the conſpiratouris quhilkis pretendit our
depoſitioun from our Royall Crowne and to erect ane vther authoritie, wer profligat and diſaponitit, and our Caſtell of Glaſ
gow than aſſegit be thame ſuccourit and releuit. Our ſaid deareſt ſiſter neuer taking or occupying ony ſtrenth, hald, or fute of
ground in Scotland, bot that quhilk ſcho hes bene alwayis willing to rander to the awneris, vpon na vther conditioū ſaulffing
thair returning to our obedience and ſuretie for continewance thairat. And ſen that tyme it is weill knawin quhat trauellis
and cair ſcho hes takin be hir Ambaſſadouris letteris and Meſſages to haue our haill Realme quyetit to our obediēce.
Quhairin hir laubouris and mediatioun hes at Goddis pleaſure takin gude ſucceſſe, our haill Realme in effect being reducit
to the acknawledgeing of our Authoritie, and in the place of the lang ciuile and inteſtine weir, gude peace reſtorit ouer all the
countrie: our Caſtell of Edinburgh only exceptit. Quhilk being put in the truſt and cuſtodie of Williame Kirkcaldy ſumtyme
of Grange Knight to our vſe and behufe be vmquhyle our deareſt Couſing Iames Erle of Murray our Regent for the time of
worthy memorie, the ſaid Williame vnmyndfull of his trenth and promyſit allevgeance, hes be the ſpace of twa ȝeiris with
the mair now bypaſt be the meanis of the ſame Caſtell raiſit and contine wit the ſaid ciuile and Inteſtine weir aganis our
Royall eſtait & Authoritie. To the diſturbance of Chriſtiane Religioun, the Lawis, policie, and haill commoun weill of our
Realme, and reiecting the godlie pacificatioun quhilkis the cheif Nobill men and vtheris returning to our obedience hes reſſauit,
procedis in contempteous Rebellioun and weir, greitly annoying our Burgh of Edinburgh being the cheif ſait of Iuſtice,
and doing beſydis quhat in him lyis to procure and draw ſtrangeris in this our Realme for ſuppreſſing of Religioun,
our eſtait, and troubling the quyetnes of this haill Ile. And ſeing our principall Ordinance, Powder, Bullettis, and munitionnis
ar detenit within our ſaid Caſtell, and vſit and ſpent aganis vs and our gude ſubiectis, our ſaid deareſt ſiſter hes
bene erniſtly requyrit be our richt traiſt Couſing Iames Erle of Mortoun Lord Dalkeith Regent to vs our Realme and liegis,
and Nobilitie of this our Realme, for ayd and ſuccouris of men, ordinance, and munitioun, to the expugnatioun, aſſege,
and recouerie of our ſaid Caſtell. Quhilk ſcho hes fauourabillie and liberallie grātit, efter all gude meanis vſit to haue brocht
the perſounis being within our ſaid Caſtell to our obedience be treatie. Bot the ſame contempnit be thame and reiectit, hes
now preparit and cauſit put hir forces in full reddynes to enter in this our Realme, to be fully employed for the mantenance
and furthſetting of our Authoritie, in aſſegeing of our ſaid Caſtell, that the ſame being recouerit, may Immediatlie and indilaitlie
be delyuerit (with the ordinance, munitioun, Royall place, Iowellis, Wardrop, and houſhald ſtuf, and with the Regiſteris
and recordis belanging to vs and our Crown) to vs and our ſaid Regent in our name & to our behufe. And ſwa thairby
peace reſtorit to our ſaid Burgh of Edinburgh and our haill Realme in our obedience, without ony vther pretenſe, meaning,
