                     〈…〉
                  ood Sir, Your Nose is durty.
            
            
               Being a merry Iest most finely conuaide,
               Betweene an old Lad, and a witty yong Maide.
            
            To the tune of Riding to Rumford.
            
               
            
            
               THere was a lusty Lad
               In London dwelling,
               That would a wooing goe,
               where drinke was selling:
               Where a Lasse lustily,
               kept this lad company.
               Till the Pots quality.
               made his nose durty.
            
            
               Tossing vp Cup and Canne.
               one after other,
               He could no longer then,
               his fancy smoother.
               But gaue vnto his Lasse
               a draught that welcome was,
               How comes it (Sir) to passe,
               your nose is durty.
            
            
               Quoth he, in courtesie
               I must be doing,
               Giue vs another Potte,
               of the last Brewing.
               Here my loue, heres to thee,
               soft a while, sir quoth she,
               For me thinks now I see
               your nose is durty.
            
            
               With that this lusty Lad,
               brauely gan swagger,
               Uowing to lay to pawne,
               his Dudgin dagger,
               Fill vs full halfe a score
               of Cannes, or somewhat more,
               Youle not away before
               your nose is durty.
            
            
               Thus the Wench flouted him
               as he was drinking,
               Which he for fauours tooke,
               to his owne thinking.
               Thus away Ale and Beare,
               went by this cople here,
               And she said still, my deare,
               your nose is durty.
            
            
               Hauing now drunke his fill,
               out he went reeling,
               With a wilde running braiue
               voide of all feeling,
               With his beloued sweet
               by his side in the street,
               Where all that did them meet,
               saw his nose durty.
            
            
               Being thus led along
               all did deride him,
               Till one among the rest,
               soundly did chide him,
               And had him home to wend
               and not his time to spend
               For now I see, my friend
               your nose is durty.
            
            
               How comes it now to passe,
               you are so myred,
               A pot of Ale quoth he
               hath my braines fired.
               Then said the other now
               I see below your brow,
               Although you know not how,
               your nose is durty.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            The second Part. to the 
                  〈…〉
               
            
            
               
            
            
               THen the Lasse led him home
               to her owne dwelling,
               Where is behapt a Iest
               well worth the telling,
               There with his durty nose
               much he did wrong his close,
               And one might then suppose
               his nose was durty.
            
            
               She brought him strong waters then,
               fit for his drinking,
               With some Tobacco, which
               made him so stinking.
               That none durst come him nie,
               if yor akse reason why,
               You know as well as I,
               his nose was durty.
            
            
               Falling then to the ground,
               came his beloued,
               Where a plaine dealing friend
               she her selfe proued.
               Seeing him in that place
               in a most drunken case,
               Staring him in the face,
               saw his nose durty.
            
            
               And for acquaintance sake
               tooke him vp friendly,
               Bearing him to a bed,
               neate, fine, and cleanly,
               And laid him downe to sleepe,
               who could not goe nor creepe
               For he had drunke so deepe,
               his nose was durty.
            
            
               Next day when he arose
               he lookt about him,
               Perceiuing how his Lasse,
               finely did flout him,
               He askt the reason why
               she told him presently,
               Then he found by and by,
               his nose was durty.
            
            
               Being sorry for his fault,
               thus he protested,
               That his braines neuer more
               should be molested,
               Thanking his louing friend,
               that she did succour lend,
               And said he would amend,
               his nose from durting.
            
            
               Parting thus soberly
               went he on trudging,
               But mist his purse, when he
               came to his lodging.
               (Quoth he) to deare a shot
               haue I paid for my lot,
               Say my friends, haue I not,
               with a nose durty.
            
            
               All men that loue good Ale,
               and other Liquer,
               Nothing in nimble braines
               can be more quicker:
               It will steale cunningly
               in your pates by and by,
               And will make shamefully,
               all your nose durty.
            
            FINIS.
