            ANTVERPIAE,
Ex officina Ioannis Fouleri.
M.D.LXVI.
         
         
            
            
            To the Indifferent
Reader.
            
               
                  I PERFOVRME now
vnto thee (Indifferent
Reader) that which I
Promised in my last
booke, which was, to
geue thee other Argumentes,
then presently
at that time I did prosecute, for which
thou shouldest BEVVARE of M. Iewel:
The Arguments cōstist in these pointes,
that M. Iewel
            1 Hath made an vnreasonable Accompt
vpon the first six hundred yeares.Fol. 1.
            
            2 That him selfe vseth the Testimonies
of what so euer Age.Fol. 22.
            
            3 That he wil not stand to the Testimonies
of the first six hundred yeares.Fol. 40.
            
            4 That he vseth the selfe same Testimonies
of the first six hundred yeares,Fol. 
                     •
                  3. against
which he bringeth Exceptions.
            5 That he alleageth such Authorities
of Fathers, as do plainely confound the
Procedinges.Fol. 9
                     •
                  .
            
            6 That he alleageth for him selfe theFol. 104.
               
woordes and deedes of Old condemned
Heretiques.
            7 That he hath Abused Aunciente
Councels.Fol. 123.
            
            8 That he hath abused the Decrees
of the Canon Law.Fol. 129.
            
            9 That he hath abused the very Gloses
of the Canon Law.Fol. 137.
            
            10 That he hath abused the Constitutions
of the Ciuile Lawe.Fol. 146.
            
            11 That he hath abused the Auncient
Fathers.Fol. 163.
            
            12 That he hath abused Later Writers.Fol. 
                     •
                  08.
            
            13 That he hath 
                  •
               alle
                  •
                into many
Contradictions to him selfe.Fol. 216.
            
            14 That he hath a great accompt to
be made for his Lies.Fol. 229.
            
            15 And that (if the foolish Obiection
be allowed 
                  •
               mong the Brethren) he is a
Borower.Fol. 233.
            
            These be the Argumentes, made to
perswade thee, to BEVVARE of M. Iewel,
And these I haue confirmed and declared,
by their propre and peculiar Examples.
What remaineth then? Any
other thing, thau that such a destroyer &

spoiler of Soules, should be brought to
his Answer? This in deede should be
done with the first, if there were that
care in men, of their Soules, as should
be in them, that acknowledge any Immortalitie
of the Soule.
            But I may wel compare, the seeing
and suffering of false and blind Teachers
that now take cure of Soules, to the permitting
& honouring of Mountebanks,
that goe abroad with diuerse thinges for
mens Bodies.
            These Mountebanks,Mountebanks 
                     •
                  or the Body. are a free kind
of Wanderers, Pedlars, Surgeans,
Physitians, Historiographers, Poetes,
or what so euer name besides you wil
geue vnto them, men altogeather for the
penie, which is the cause that they professe
so many thinges. They take vp
their standing in Market places, or void
roomes meere for the 
                  ••
               course of people,
there they set a stoole to stand vpon, or
make a litle scaffold for the purpose, from
which they play their part.
            Their Greatest Grace is in the
Countenance & Tongue, through which,
they looke so Saddely, and speake so

eloquētly, that a man would sweare vpō
a booke for them, that they thinke as they
speake, & speak nomore, than they wil do.
            What so euer thing they haue to sel,
as Newes out of India, Or The Original
of the Turkishe Empire, Or Mery Tales,
Or Songes and Ballets. Or a Pouder to kil
wormes, Or A Preseruatiue againste the
Plague, Or A Water to make the skynne
faire and white, Or Pinnes, Pointes, Laces,
whistles, & other such ware, whatsoeuer it
be, they commend it and praise it before.
But they do
                  •
                it with such a Grace, with
such a Constancie, with such Copie of
words, with such mouing of Affectio
                  •
               s,
that it is wonderful. As
            If it be a Water, a Pouder, an Oyntmente,
a Confection not worth twentie
pence, he wil make such a doe about it, as
though it could scarse be bought for halfe
a Kinges raunsome. And standing first
vp like a worshipful man, Arayed in his
silkes and veluettes, And al to be rayed
with braslettes & bowed peeces of golde,
And chained about the neck with a great
thing (of copper and gylt, as many iudg
                  •
               ,
but) of pure and fine gold, as farre as the

eye seeth, he wil tel his Audience: That
he is come vnto them for good wils sake,
moued in him by the Fame and Worthines
of them and theyr Citie or Toune:
He will tell them, that he can not tarie
long, & that, before he depart, he would
fai
                  •
               e bestow vpon them some token of
his good affection: Then wil he bringfurth
that water or pouder, or conceipt,
which he would vtter, and say, That it
was brought from beyonde Calecut, or
the Red Sea: and then wil he point with
his finger towardes Calecut, and make a
like disgressiō, to declare how far that is
of, from their Countrie, as M. Iewel
doth to praise (after his maner) y• Popes
of Rome: after this, he wil shew the vertue
and strength of his Pouder: And
further declare, how much thereof hath
been bought in greate Cities, and of
noble Personages which he wil name:
and further yet, he wil make them think,
that it is al that he hath leaft, that which
he offereth to be bought of them: He wil
also disgrace other Mountebankes that
goe abroad the Countrie, and say, That
their wares are but counterfeit, but that

his are fine, and pure, and fresh. For why
he se
                  •
               keth not after gaines▪ as the coue
               
                  •
               ous
and beggarly knaues doe, but as it
becommeth 
                  •
                good Gentleman, he trauaileth
farre and wide vpon his owne
Charges to get such geare, as may bring
Commodities to whole Countries. In
Cōclusion, when he hath spoken as much
as he can, then he prouoketh the hearers
againe and againe to bye. And if it be
a water which he commended, he putteth
in Glasses, made for the purpose, halfe a
skore or a skore of droppes thereof: If
it be a pouder, he putteth as much as he
can hold betwen his Thombe and Forefinger,
in seueral papers, and beginneth
to make merchandise. And that which
as it should seeme by his tale, should be
wel worth a Croune a droppe, he wil sel,
with good gaines, for a myte or two, of
which, twelue do make but a penie.
            Such maner of Fellowes be the
Mountebankes. But what say the
Lordes and Signiours of the Townes
vnto them? They contein
                  •
               e them vndoubtedly
in their Iudgement▪ & thinke
it not al worth the taking vp, which they

so highly commend. Yet they laugh at
them, and say that so good and eloq
                  •
               ent
an Oration, as they make to the people,
doth them a farthing worth of g
                  •
               od, at y•
least, in relieuing their spirits, and mouing
their Affections. So th
                  •
               t there
is no greate harme done, although it be
nothing worth, that which they vtter.
            Especially wheras some of the Mountebankes,
do either by Singing, or plai
                  •
               ng
vpon Instrumentes, so hold the peo

                  •
               y looke
for their merchantes, that for theyr fitte
of mirth onely, they are worthy of somewhat.
And besides this, al is not coū
               terfeit,
that they put furth to sale, and
though they make it more in words▪ than
it is worth, yet if they should hold their
peace altogeather, it is not nothing that
which they sel. And in Conclusion,
whiles they hurt not the Sta
                  •
               e and the
Common welth, let the peo
                  •
               le and them
cope togeather, what is that to great affaires?
            A Montebank then, may crake, and
lie, and outface his Aduersarie, and make
somewhat of nothing, and mingle sport
                  •
               
               
with sadnesse, and play what part he wil
in the sight of the people, and hundreds
wil gase vpon him, but none wil reproue
him.
            Like vnto these, in an other kinde,
there be other Mountebankes,Mountebankes for y• Soule. men so
fr
                  •
               e, that they be lawlesse, So ful of faire
promises, that they sel, for one comming
vnto them, euerlasting life, So louing &
kind harted, that they forsake their owne
Countrie, and without asking of licence,
or directly against commaundment, bye
and sel within other mens Iurisdiction.
            Yet, in Faith, they doe it somewhat
manerly, they rush not into Cities and
Townes at the first, but, without the
Towne walles, they choose out a place
in the open fielde, or in some wodde, and

the Preacher, and there straitwaies doth
the Mountebanke beginne to open.
            But what stuffe it is▪ that he there
openeth, it can not be declared in a short
time and Preface▪ the So
                  •
               me yet is this:
That he commeth vnto them with comfortable
wares: That he commeth from

farre Countries: That except they wil
be thankeful and receiue the Grace that
he bringeth, he wil depart againe: That
he wil aske nothing for his labor: That
he deliuereth them quite, from feare of
Purgatorie, and Hel also (for Purgatotorie
there is none at al, and to hel he wil
warrant them neuer to come) That thei
shal haue no more bonde of fasting, watching,
praying, performing of lawfull
vowes, &c: That they shal haue no more
Signe of Crosse, or Christ, or our Lady,
or any Sainct in their eye, nor any memorie
of them in their hart, & yt they shal
haue al peace & cōfort, if they wil bye but
one dram of the doctrine yt he bringeth.
            And then he instructeth them in the
Doctrine of Caluin, Or (if the Mountebanke
be a Lutheran) in the Doctrine of
Luther, Or (if he be an Anabaptist) in
the Doctrine of Rotman. For the
Mountebankes be of fundry sectes, and
euery one praiseth his own wares most,
and contemneth his felowes packe.

that they had ben drowned in it, if other
more sober had not come thither, & pulled
them out.
            Uerely this is a sowsing Gospel,
which so 
                  •
               mbrueth the mindes of the
folowers of it: And these are perfite and
excellent Mountebanks, which can geue
such preseruatiues, against al Godlines,

and Obedience, and Honestie. If there
had ben any Feare of God or Man, remaining
in these mens hartes, woulde
they haue spoiled Innocentes, Or without
lawful Authoritie, haue enterprised
feates so desperate? Crake not of these
Proceedinges, O ye feruent and hote
sprited Merchantes of this worlde, and
send no letters of praise to the Lorde for
this victorie, which cōsisted in oppressing
of Innocentes, and in plaine robbing of
Churches. Came our Sauiour into
the world with such terrour? Did the
Apostles conuert the worlde, by violent
and felonious entring into any places?
Did they deny lawful Obedience vnto
the Magistrates, and the Princes & Rulers
of any Countrie? The Procedings
of these daies, are no more like the preachinges
of the Apostles, or the Primitiue
Church, than a Diuel is like an Angel.
And yet the Mowntebankes continue
stil, Lutherans against Caluinistes, Caluinistes
against Lutherans, both they
against Anabaptistes, and Anabaptistes
against them both.

               y. But I shal tel you (deere brethren)
I haue seene and readen as much

as any man, yea as all the learned men aliue:
I haue trauailed vnto the very Primitiue
Church it selfe: I haue bene conuersant
with Old Catholike Doctors, and
Fathers, and old General Councels. As
for these Priests, Cardinals and Popes,
whom you folowe, they bring nothing,
but Conclusions of Scholemen, and deuises
of Later Doctours, and Ceremonies
of their owne making, &c. But I
will bring you no other thing, but that
which is Auncient. I wil bring you back
to the Institution of Christ himself. You
shal haue al things ministred vnto you,
as they were in the time of the Apostles.
You shal heare God himself speake vnto
you. The Priestes shall robbe you no
more of halfe the Sacrament. You shall
knowe, what you heare readden in the
Church. Ye shal haue no Supremacie of
Pope, no Real Presence of Christs body
in the Sacrament. Ye shal be brought to
Old Customes, which ye Councel of Nice
would haue to preuaile: And Tertullian
shal teach you, how that is true, that was
first ordeined. And, as I saied before, so
say I now againe, If any man aliue be

hable to reproue me, I will become his
obedient Scholer. But I know, there is
not one that is able to do
                  •
                it, and because
I know it, therefore I speake it. So
beginneth, the Mountebanke.
            But in further processe he is proued
to be so vaine in Craking, So crafty in
Shifting, So demure in Coūterseiting,
So false in Affirming, So desperate in
Abusing of his Aduersarie, of old Councels,
and Doctours, yea and of new also,
that it is perceiued wel inough, euen of
them that say, God saue you my Lorde, vnto
him, that al is not so as he saith. Neuerthelesse
they haue a good sporte, to see

               IT may seeme by my Two former

as great Sophistrie, Brauerie, &
Insinceritie of M. Iewels, as any man
lightly, that hath but worldly regarde of
his Trueth and Honestie, may coulourably
venter to practise. But in comparison
of that which I haue further to obiect,
the forsaid behauiours, may seme to
be perdonable.
            For D. Harding is but one man,
and the same not knowen to the whole
worlde, and much lesse honoured of the
whole. He is also his Aduersary, and
M. Iewel taketh him selfe, to be in
no point perchaunse, of lesse worthinesse:
And if in some one or two, D. Harding
farre pass
                  •
               th him, yet in many moe
on the other side, he thinketh him selfe to
be better. And therefore, when he doth
handle him at his pleasure, & belye him,

Contemne him, Mocke him, and Tosse
him, without doubting or blusshing: although
it be very il done, yet it is not
exceeding il.
            But to despise men (without al doubt)
worthy & notable, To set light by them,
whom the whole world hath reuerēced,
To interprete Lawes and Canons after
his own liking, To disanul general coū
               cels,
To corrupt Auncient Fathers, To
set them vp, to pul them doune againe,
To bring them in, to thrust them againe
out, To binde men to the Authoritie of
the first six hundred yeares, To appeale
to the Primitiue Church only in his own
cause, and to drawe his Aduersarie vnto
any State of Churche within these last
fiftene hundred yeares, and for a

               vantage
to make the practise thereof, a Definitiue

is that, which I shal now

impossible, bothe by Faith and by
Reason.
               For, like as we are assured by right
Faith,
                     
                        •
                      Tim. 2. that there is but One God, One Iesus
Christ God and man,
                  1. Cor. 12. 
                  One Spirite diuiding vnto
eche as he vvill,
                  Eph. 4. 
                  One Bodie, One Doue, One
Louier,
                  Cant 6. 
                  One Bevvtiful and One Catholik Church:
so is it impossible by Naturall Reason,
that of Unitie, A Diuision might be
made, And that one Part might be found
contrary to the other, or One Part worthier
than the other, where there is no
Partes making at all, and therefore no
Parts taking at al, to cause any Discord.
               
                  Is Christ (sayeth the Apostle) diuided?
                  1. Cor. 1.

                  Da. 7. And
doe not both Testamentes,Luc. 1. new and old,
plainely teache,The churche is one by Faith. 
                  that his kingdome is euerlasting?
How then should his Church be
Contrary vnto it self, and thereby cumming

to Diuision, ende afterwardes in
Dissolution?
               Againe, The Spiritie of Truthe was promised
vnto her, which should teach her all
Truthe, and tary also vvith her for euer. There
be also prouided for her, meete Gouernours
and Officers, to continue with
her and serue her, to theEphe. 4. 
                  perfiting of the holy,
vntill all doe meete togeather, in Vnitie of Faith,
and knovvledge of the Sonne of God: so that,
because of the Authoritie of the Chiefe
Master, whome it is Impossible to lie,
And the continuall succession of Ushers
vnder him,The churche cā not erre or faile. whome he maketh to teach as
he Inspireth: the Lessons which at this
day are readen in the Church, ought to
be in deede of as greate Credite emong
vs, as any of the Primitiue Churches
lessons. Except perchaunce the Sprite
be so blinde or blasphemous in any person,
as to deny his Almightinesse in making
of such as dwel in his house, of One
minde and Accorde, Of whose Promise,
Prouision and Charitie towardes hys
church, we haue so infallible testimonies.
               Therefore, as the Scriptures perswade
our vnderstanding to beleue, that

the Church is One, That it shall Continue
for euer,The churche is allwaies one and true, by reason. That it shall neuer Erre
in Doctrine: so Reason concludeth by
this gift and light of Faith, that because
it is ONE, it must either be NONE at
all, or continue ONE. And because IT
CONTINVETH FOR EVER, it can
not therefore be NONE. Remaining
then ONE, it is to be credited without al
doubt, because it hath the Sprite of Truthe
with her and can not erre: And as well
to be credited now, as it was xv. hūdred
yeres sense, because it is ONE, and the
selfe same nowe, as it was then, concerning
Assistance of the Holy ghost, Priuileges
of Honour, Infalliblenesse of
Truthe, Or any other like, parteining to
the very Substance and nature (as I
may say) of the Church of Christ.
               Like as, in your self (M. Iewel,) Or
in any of vs, the same Reasonable Soule
and Sensitiue life, that we receyued of
God and our Parents at our beginning,
continueth yet stil wt vs the Self same in
substance, Notwithstanding many thousand
Alterations, in Affections of minde,
and Disposition of body, which haue in

the meane time chaunced vnto vs,In what things the Church is not allwais one. And
chainged vs, in the chaunce: so, notwithstanding
many Alterations, which haue
bene in the Church of Christ these xv.C.
yeres, concerning external Gouernment
thereof, and Ecclesiasticall Orders. The
life yet, Soule and Sense therof, is of the
same making and worthinesse, in all
Times and Circumstancies.
               In the Opinion and Imagination, of
fainte harted and weake Christians, it
appeareth (I graunt) to be of more Authoritie,
If Christ, in his owne person
speaketh, than if S. Paule his Apostle, by
his will and commaundement speake it.
And, no doubt, they haue a good Zeale
therein often times and Deuotion, but
they haue not alwaies good knowledge
and Understāding. The Maries brought
tidinges vnto the Apostles, of the Resurrection
of our Sauiour, and though
they were but Women, yet they were deuout,
Wise and blessed women, And their
sayinges agreed with the woordes of
Christ himselfe spoken vnto them before
his Passion, so that they might well, and
should haue bene credited: Neuerthelesse,

their wordes seemed vnto the Apostles
no better than A Doting and vaine
tale,Luc. 24. And S. Peter ranne to the Sepulchre,
to see perchaunce whether he coulde
finde a better Argument or Testimonye
of the Resurrection, than the Maries
had brought, vnto him and his fellowes.
Which Argument,Let vs not be vnbeleuing, but faithfull.
when it was the selfe
same daie, made after the best maner vnto
them, that is, by Christes owne presence
and wordes: yet S. Thomas being at
that time absent, and hearing at his Returne,
of the sight and ioye which his fellowes
had:Ioan▪ 20. 
                  Except I see (quod he) the
print of the nailes, and put my hand into his side,
I vvill not beleue. As who should say, that
he alone could see more in such a matter,
than ten other, Or that if he once tried i
                     •
                  
and beleued it him self, then it were to be
bidden by: but, if he lerned and receiued
it of other mens Report and knowledge,
then loe, it was not clear, and out of question.
Yet the Truthe is alwaies O
                     •
                  e.
And as faithfully it was to haue bene beleued,
yt, which the Maries or Apostles
saw and heard, As that which S. Thomas
not only saw or hard, but fealt also.
               
                  
Now, in these foresaid Persons and
Examples, the inward and harty deuotion,
did somewhat extenuate the Carnalitie
of the Affection. Mary in other Cases,
it is grosser and viler.Carnall iudgment. As, when A
Noble and Honorable man speaketh A
wise worde, it is regarded and remembred:
but when a poore and Simple
Soule, doth speake the like, it lacketh the
same Grace and strength, with the hearers.
Yet, the Trueth and wisedome of
the saying being on both sides all ONE
in goodnesse, it might well become all
men to honor it, without Respect of persons.
               When our Sauiour vpon a time, preached
in the Synagoge of the Iewes, so
singularly well, that all men wondred at
his Doctrine:Marci. 6. 
                  Hovv cummeth this felovve,
(sayed they) by all this lerning? Is not this
he, that is the Carpenter, the sonne of Mary,
the brother of Iames and Ioseph? Are not his
sisters also here dvvelling vvith vs? As who
should say, We know his bringing vp
well inough, And therefore he is not so
greatly to be wondered at. Such is
the Iudgment of carnall men, euen vnto

this day. They measure Truthes, by
their Imaginacions, And set a great
Price on thinges, that are farther out of
their reach, Contemning as good or better
than those thinges are, when they are
easy to be found or alwaies present.
               
                   Which thing, If it come of the Misery
of our Nature, it is to be lamented, and
the Remedie is to be sought for of hym,
which therefore toke our whole Nature
(synne excepted) vpon him, that by partaking
thereof, we might be purged of
 our sinne and Corruption. If it come
of the Foly of any deintines, it is (in some
parsons) to be reproued with fauor, like
as Children and Women are much to be
borne withall in respect of their weakenesse
 and frailtie. If it come of lacke of
better Instruction, Or dulnesse of vnderstanding
(as in the Rude and Simple of
the Countrie) they are to be warned, as
well as we may, and for the rest to be

                  
                     •
                  raied for and tolerated. If it come of
some Pride, Spite or Contention, it is to
be condemned and hated, what so euer
the person be.
               But in M. Iewel, whereof may I

thinke, that this Affection doth come, of
which I speake? For you also, in defining
of euerlasting Trueth, by Terme of
yeares, doe seeme to haue a spice of their
disease, which coutemne the good things
that are nigh vnto them.
               Shall I Impute this faule, vnto the
generall Miserie of our nature, which
was corrupted in our first Parentes?
               God sende you the

                   And for this which you haue
already done, Repent and be sory.
               But came it of a certaine wantones or
niceues in you,Or play no more t

same meat or bread, Or women loue farfet

not be serued, but with the Testimonies
and Authorities of the firste six hundred
yeres of our Lord? Truely, if it be so,
you can not loke for the Fauor, that childerne
and Women haue in their Infirmities.
               Will you haue it then, to be attributed
vnto lacke of Lerning, Or plaine Dulnesse,
that you are so blinde and blunt,Or lerne more wit. as
to set at naught the Practise and Euidencies

of the Catholike Church for nine
hundred yeres togeather? It seemeth
no, because the Opinion vndoubtedlye,
which your predecessours of late, had of
their owne Iudgment, Knowledge and
Wittinesse, moued them especially, to refuse
the Generall and Approued Faith of
the world. And so I beleue they lacked
no wit, but only Grace, and they were to
wise to be Obedient and Faithful.
               How now then? Was it any Sprite
of Malice or Contention, that caused you
to rest vpon the first six hundred yeres
only, that the further you went out of
sight, you might the more boldly shewe

                     •

the victory vncertaine, And trouble the
lookers on? If it be not so, we shal easely
beleue you, if you shew any good
Cause or Reason, wherefore you haue
appealed vnto the first six hundred yeres:
And so appealed vnto them, not, as the
best time to finde witnesses in: but as the
only time: neither as Preferring those
Daies, but as Condemning ours.
               But, let vs first see the Examples, by
which your fact and behauioure herein

may be Euident, And then after, we shal
the better consider it, whether you haue
any reason or no, to make for you, And
what (by likelihode) was the cause which
moued you.

                  Mary,
                  Ie. pa. 75 he wrote (say you) A great while
after that.
               And what of that?Ra. Is S. Bedes History,
of the cumming of S. Augustine the
Monke into England, to be discredited,
because S. Bede began to wryte, a great
while after S. Augustine was departed
this world? Or, because the next six
hundred after Christ, were much passed
when he wrote it? Are the bokes of
Genesis, in any poynt, to be doubted of,
because they declare the beginning of the
world, and Actes Dated two thousand
yeres, before Moyses the wryter of them
was borne? Yet sayeth M. Iewel against
Leontius, This one Circumstance

Schoole confesseth in his boke De
locis Communibus, that in the first Councel
of Ephesus, an Order was taken for
Communion vnder one kinde: which,
he being a Lutherane, would neuer haue
wryten, if he had not found it, in some
Auncient Record and worthy of credite.
               But Vrbanus Regius (say you) departed
this life,Iew. 112. not aboue .xx. yeres a goe, and
therefore, is a very yong witnesse to testify
a thing done so long time before.
               In deede to testifye it as of certaine
sight or knowledge,Ra. it were hard for so
young a witnesse: but to testify it, as of
good Historie and Authoritie, it is possyble
inough for them, which are .xx. yeres
younger.
               What shall we thinke of S. Bernard:The iij.
A man, not only in his own time of most
worthy Estimation and Authoritie, but,
in all the Church euer sence, of singular
Credite and worthinesse? If he were

now aliue emong vs, And might be seen
and heard sensibly, would there be found
in all the world any man of Honestie or
Discretion, which considering his Holinesse,
Wisedome and Grauitie would
thinke him A witnesse of litle weight
and worthinesse? Yet, Father Iewel
sayeth, as though he had bene a Reader
of Diuinitie, when S. Bernard was yet
but A Noui

was a Doctour but of late yeres, and therefore
his Authoritie must herein weigh the
lesser.
               Was he of so late yeres,Ra. as Luther, Zuinglius,
Caluine, Peter Martir, and other
Greate Anceters of your new Religion?
Why dothe not the latenesse of these felowes,
offend you? Why think you, the
xij.C. yeres after Christ, to be so farre
and wide from his Trueth, that no certaintie
thereof maye be taken in them:
And Conclude, Determine, Protest and
Defend, that, to be Sure and Autentike,
which riseth xv.C. and some odde yeres
after Christ?
               
                  
                  Of the like kinde of Imaginacion and

An English woman, as the reporter of
the tale sayth, borne at Magunce in Germany.)
Which was almost nine hundred

might well haue bene spared.
               
               Thus we see then,Ra. by manifest Examples,
the exact Accompt that you make of
the first six hundred yeres after Christ,
As though the whole Truthe of A mater

were lost, if it come to knowledge, any
long time after the thing was done.
               Let vs consider now, Whether any

either you be hable to Answer them, and
that shall be to your worship: either not
Answering them, you shall occasyon
Trueth therby to be knowen. And that
shall be to Gods glorie and the Cumfort
of the doubtfull. Surely, if it were to
my selfe, and if so much might be obtained,
that I should be Answered in some
One thing thoroughly, and be bid to
choose, out of all that which I haue to

strongest agaynst my Aduersary,
and surest of the Catholikes: I would

                     •
                  e
which foloweth, though thou Reade no
more of all the Booke.
               First,The firste question. Faith, or 
                        •
                     o Faith? I aske of you (M Iewel) whether
you haue any Faith at all, or no?
               If you haue none, what meddle you,
with any Religion: except it be for Ciuil
Policie sake? For which to doe as you
doe, though it would proue you lesse mad
or vnreasonable, yet should you be (for
lacke of Faith) as deade in soule and as
Godlesse, as any Infidel in al the world.
If ye haue any,Faithe. how came you by it? for
we are not borne Christians, but Regenerate:
neither doe we receiue faith by
Nature, but by Teaching. And, faith is
by hearing,
                  Rom. 10. sayeth the Apostle.
               Of whome then haue you heard and
lerned your Faith?The ij. question. Lerned you it, of y• quicke or the deade? Of them that liued
and died before you were borne? Or of
such as preached and taught in the world

sens your selfe were of remembrance?
               If you lerned of the first, how could
they teache, without A tongue? Or how
could you heare without an care? For
they were now deade in body, and cleane
dissolued, and you were not yet made of
body and soule, nor had any instruments
of senses.
               If you lerned of the Quicke and Liuing,
your self also quicke and liuing,Of the Quicke. The iij. Question.
were those your Teachers of such Authoritie
with you, that you submitted
your senses and vnderstanding,Folowed
you their Authority or no? to theyr
iudgment? Or examined you, by your
selfe, their Doctrine and Sayinges?
               If you the Scholer did iudge of the
Master, you were without all doubt, a
Malapert and Folishe Scholer. Malapert,
because you would breake order,
and proudly goe before him, whome you
ought meekly to haue folowed: And
Folishe, because in maters of Faith, (of
which we now speake) all Wit and Reason
of man, is altogeather vnworthy and
vnable, to Iudge of that which is Proponed.
               If you then folowed their Authoritie,The iiij. Question.
                  
and submitted your vnderstanding and
will vnto their Doctrine, without Mouing
or Mistrusting any doubt about it:
VVhat were they in all the world,
                  What are they?
                  vnto whome you gaue such credite?
               
               I aske you not this question, for the
time of your Childhode, in which, though
true Faith be Habitually in them that
are Baptised: yet there is not that Discretion
or Consideration, by which they
may returne their mindes vpon theyr
own
                     •
                   actes, Or put a difference betwene
their Grādmothers tale of Bloudy bone,
Raw head, Bloudelesse and Ware woulf,
and the Churches Doctrine of Hell and
the Deuill. But I speake now, as to
one that hath Understanding and knowledge
of his owne state, And Experience
of many thinges, And Lerning inough
for the purpose, And such a one, whose
part and profession it is, to be able to
geaue a good Cause and Reason, for the
Faith and Religion which he foloweth.
Of you therefore I aske, what Authority
that was, Or is, which moued you to be,
and continue A Christian?
               Here, you must not say vnto me, that

you considered the wrytinges of the Fathers
of the first six hundred yeres. And
that you gaue your minde to Reading
of the Scriptures. &c.Here let al the heretikes in y• world ioin wyth the Papists if they can. For what so euer
such tale yo
                     •
                   tell me, it will alwaies remaine
to be Answered of you, what Instruction
or Authoritie that was, which
either Taught you, Or

                   you, to
esteeme those Auncient Doctors of the
Christian Religion, Or these Scriptures
of which you make your self so certaine?
For by your selfe, you could no more
know, the difference betwene Writers
and Writers, or true Scriptures and lying
Fables, than A Blinde man cā iudge
of Colours, Or a Stranger know the
right way in A Wildernesse, or he Rede,
that knoweth no letter on the booke.
               You are not (I am sure) wiser thā S.
Augu. Neither haue you better thought
vpō these maters, than he did. He saith of
himself, y• concerning the Faith which he
had in Christ.August. ad Honoratū cap. 14. de vtilit ate credendi. 
                  He savv himselfe, to haue beleued
none, but the established opinion of Peoples &
Nations, and the very Common and renoumed
Fame of him. Than which cause, if you can
geue any better, it is time y• you shew it.

As for vs, neither we finde any like, And
we neede not be ashamed to be perswaded
by it, which moued S. Augustine him
selfe, to come vnto Christ.
               And I think verely, that neither you,
studying neuer so much for it,An euidēt Demonstration to perswade vs to beleue. can bring
any so perswasible a Reason, why you
beleued Christ, as this is: that, So many
Nations and peoples of the world
doe beare witnesse to him. For this
is so Great and so Stronge to induce
vs into Faith, that we should not now
be desirous of visible Miracles for Prouing
Or Confirming of it, S. Aug
                     •
                  stine
moste wisely and Reasonably warning
vs:De ciuit.
                  Quisquis adhuc prodigia,
                  Dei lib. 22. Cap. 8. 
                  vt credat, inquirit:
magnum est ipse prodigium, Qui MVNDO
CREDENTE non credit. VVho so euer
doth yet seeke after Straunge and vvonderfull
thinges, to make him beleue: he is himselfe a
straunge felovv or Greate vvonder, vvhich beleueth
not, vvhen the vvorld beleueth.
               
               
                  This Conclusion then standyng so
sure, (that the Uoice of the Worlde, so
Great, so Generall, so Certaine and so
Famous, hath made wise men to come

vnto Christ) I will, in like sort, dispute
with you (M. Iewel,) as S. Augustine
did against the Manichees. And as he
sayed against them vpon the foresayde
Truthe:
                  De Vtilit. cred. Cur non igitur apud eos potissimum,
diligentissimè requiram, quid Christus praeceperit,
quorum authoritate commotus,Cap. 14. Christum aliquid
Vtile praecepisse credidi? Tune mihi melius
expositurus es quid ille dixerit? Quem fuisse, aut
esse, non putarem, si abs te mihi hoc commendaretur
esse credendum▪ Hoc ergo credidi (vt dixi)
famae, celebritate, consensione, Vetustate roboratae.
Vos autèm & tam pauci & tam turbulenti &
tam noui, nemini dubium est quin nihil dignum
authoritate praeseratis. Seeing I haue beleued
the constant Fame and Reporte
of Nations in Cummyng to Christe,
why should not I then, most diligently
seeke what Christ commaunded,
emong them most chiefly, by whose
Authoritie I haue bene moued to beleue
that Christ commaunded things
profitable? Wilt thou better expound
vnto me what he sayd? whome

I would not beleue to haue ben, Or to
be, if from thee, this were Commended
vnto me to be beleued. For I
haue beleued it, (as I sayed) because
of the fame established and strēghtned
by Renoune, Consent, Auncientnes:
But you, both so Fewe, and
so Troblesome, and so New, there is
no man doubteth, but that ye can
show nothing worthy of Authoritie.
               Thus S. Augustine.
               
                  The Manichees would answer as heretikes
doe now.
                  
                     
                        •
                     anich. What? you must
make no question of it, whether Christ is
to be beleued or no.
               
                  S. Augustine
                  August. 
                  Replieth and so do we.

               VVhat exceding madnesse then is
this? Beleue them (the Catholikes)
that thou must beleue Christ, and

lerne of vs what he saied. By what
reason I pray the? For, if they should
faile, and could not teache me any
thi
                     •
                  g, I would much more easely perswade
my selfe, that Christ is not to
be beleued: than, that I should lerne
any thing concerning him, but of
them, through whome I had 
                     •
                  eleued
him. O what a greate Boldnesse is
this, or rather what a greate Folishnesse?
               I wil teache you (sayeth the Heretike) what Christ commaunded,Manich. whom you
beleue. To whome S. Augustine.
               
               VVhat if I did not bele
                     •
                  e him?August.
Couldest thou teache me any thing of
him?
               Nay there is no remedy (sayth the Manichee)
you must beleue.Manich. 
                  Sainct Augustine
answereth:
               
               W
                     •
                  ether by your Commending
of him?August.
               
               
                  
No (sayeth he) For we leade them by
Reason,Manich. that beleue him.
               For what Reason then (sayeth S.August.
Augustine) must I beleue him?
               Because there is A grounded and established
Fame?Manich.
               
               VVas it grounded by you or by
other?August.
               
               By other sayeth he.Manich.
               
               Ergo shal I beleue them,August. that you
maye teache me? Perchaunce I
should, except they had especiallye
warned me hereof, that I should not
at al, come vnto thee.
               Thou wilt Answer,Manich. They Lie.
               How then shall I beleue them cō
                  cerning
Christ,August. whome they haue
not seene, and shall not beleue them
concerning the, whome they will
not see?
               Beleue (sayeth he) the Scriptures.Manich.
               
               But what so euer Scripture it be,August.
                  
if it be brought furth new and vnheard
of before, the credite is geuen,
not vnto it, but vnto thē that bring
if furth. VVherefore, the Scriptures
themselues, if you so few and vnknowen
do bring furth, I haue no list
to beleue them.
               Here againe (saieth S. Augustine to
the Manichee) thou wilt cal m
                     •
                   backe vnto
the multitude and the fame.
               
                  And so doe our Protestantes nowe.
What (say they) will you doubte of the
Scriptures?Cōfer and consider whether y• vpstart he retikes be not like the old. Nay then fare well. There is
no talke with you, we perceiue. Why there
is no man that denieth them. We see how
generally they are alowed and receiued of
all men. Either we must beleue nothing,
or beleue them: whome by so many mens
Report and Consent, we finde to be agreed
vpon.
               To whom we answer as S. Augustin
did vnto the Manichee, which would
haue the Fame and Uoice of the World,
to be an euident and sure Argumente,
wherefore we should make no doubt of

of the Scriptures, And yet, would not be
ruled by the Uoice and Consent of that
Multitude in the rest of the Christian &
Catholike Faith:
               Cohibe tandem pertinaciam et istam nescio
quam indomit am propagandi nominis libidinem,August.
et mone potius vt huius multitudinis Primates,
quaeram diligentissime ac laboriosissime; vt ab
his potius de his literis aliquid discam. &c.
               Staie now at lenght your egernesse
and contention, and this, I can not
tell what, Vnruly desire and Lust of
getting and stretching furth a name.
And Counsel me rather to seeke out
the Primates and Chiefe of this multitude,
and to seeke them out moste
diligently and ernestly, that of them
rather, I may lerne sumwhat of these
letters▪ (the Scriptures.) Which mē
if they were not, I should not at all
knowe it, that I had any thing to
lerne. As for the (that arte the Heretike)

                  returne into THY LVRKING HOLES
AND CORNERS AGAINE. &c.
               
               Thus far S. Augustine.
               By which his Discourse against the
Maniches, and our folowing of it against
the Protestants, how Uncertaine,
Unsensible, and Contentious must it
be, to Appeale to the vj.C. yeres only
after Christ, as though there were none,
at this presēt, in the world, which might
and ought to be fully obeyed? For, if
the Scriptures themselues are now beleued,
not because they were beleued in
the vj.C. after Christ, (for what can we
iudge by any sence of thinges paste and
gone A thousand yeres sens?) But because
they which now li
                     •
                  e, and whome
we may iustly beleue, doe reporte so vnto
vs, that they haue bene commended
vnto the World by them that saw Christ,
and heard him, and touched him: And
that they haue continued, these xv.C.
and odde yeres emong Christians, allwaies
of full Authoritie, (be it the six
hundred or ten hundred, or xv.C. after
Christe, that you will coumpt vpon.)

If, I say, the Scriptures themselues are
beleued of vs, because of the present commendacion
of this Age which we be in,
and Authoritie which is in the primates
of this multitude of Christians:
               
               Howe can we goe in any mater of the
Faith, from the Iudgement of this present
Age, And refuse euery thing that is
brought vnto vs, except it be out of the
first six hundred yeres after Christ?
               For suppose it, that no man aliue
NOW, had openly held with Christ:
would M. Iewel cleaue vnto y• Creedes
of the first six hundred yeres? And by his
owne self, would he chuse to folow the
Christian faith of those daies, if there had
ben in the world, for these last yeares, no
Praise or Speaking of Christ at all?
               How is it credible? For being but a mā,
how should he not, by all likelihoode, folow
the common course of men? And if
he would needes be Singular, how
could he discerne betwene the true and
the false Opinions of the first six hundred
yeres, whereas he should finde Examples
and Wrytings of both? Or not able

to discerne betwene them, how could
he fasten his minde and beleife vpon any
one of them bothe,Who hath com
                        •
                     ēded Christ vnto M. Iew. but the report of this age in which himselfe hath liued. except he were A Singular
one in deede? For wisemen, doe
not lightly take that way, in which they
see not, either the Towne plainely before
them, or some Cawsey, Pathes, or Steps
of feete to direct them: Neither doe they
vse (when they goe in the right way, and
come at lenght to some turning or duble
waie) to go forward, I can not tell how,
without loking backe if any folow, Or
loking about if any be within sight: but
either rest themselues, vntill they spie of
whome to aske, Or goe so doubtefully
forward in that which leeketh them, that
if better Counsell and teaching come vnto
thē, they wil be returned and ordered.
               And if it be so in A corporall and visible
way, ought it not to be much more
so, in folowing the right way vnto truth
of vnderstanding and knowledge? And,
when the whole world taketh one waie,
Or diuerse cumpanies in the world folow
diuerse waies, would any man of
Discretion be so Bolde or Foolishe, as to
goe peaking alone by himselfe in such an

Opinion or Imagination, as no man
byside himselfe aloweth? And so directly
go in it, that to liue and die, he would
not be brought from it? If therefore
these fortie yeres last past (or what so euer
it be more that M. Iewel hath liued
in the world) nor Christ had bene
Preached, nor the Primitiue Churche
commended: he could not vndoubtedly
by any good Occasion or Reason, haue
estemed the Christian wryters of a thousand
yeres sens, Or geauen any Faith
vnto Christ. Except we should thinke
(otherwise than y• Apostle hath taught
vs) y• faith commeth without hearing, Or
that no man sent for him, yet by some
Miracle perchannce he was brought vnto
Christ. Of which two, both are out
of course: And without some Extraordinary
way of making them likely vnto
vs, both are Unreasonable, both are Incredible.
               The present Fame then, Renoume, &
Testimonie of this Age, drawing men of
this Age vnto Christ, yet doth M. Iewel
so litle set by it, as though it were worthy
of litle credite, or rather none. And he

so clea
                     •
                  eth vnto those vj.C. yeres, past
A thousād. yeres, almost, sens: as though
he could be sure of the Catholike & true
Faith that was then, wtout the Testimonies
of the Catholike Church now, Or
as though some secrete Mistery or Securitie
were in them, to further him in vnreueled
Conclusions, And exempt him
from all Iurisdiction. In so much, that
although in xv.C. yeres rekening, which
the Church hath continued in (as it shall
to the worldes end) viij. yeres can not
greatly hurt the Accompt, Yet, so true an
Audite of thē, is kept by M. Iewel, that
he wil not receiue the Testimonies of the
viij. yeres next after the first vj.C. but
noteth in his Booke their cumming to
late, though they came very nigh. His
wordes be these.
               M. Harding knoweth wel,Iew. 242 Sticking vpon viij. yeres. that this graūt
(to be called The Head of al Churches,)
was made vnto Bonifacius the third, which
was Bisshope of Rome in the yere of our
Lord vj.C. and viij. Euen at the same very
time, that Mahomete first began to plant his
Doctrine in Arabia. And therfore maketh
nothing to this purpose, as bei
                     •
                  g without
the cumpasse of six hundred yeres.
               
                  
As who should thinke,Did he, think you, perswade wyth the Emperor, to geaue y• Title, Or with the Pope to receiue it? Or how bring you Arabia &
Rome here togeather? that within
those viij. yeres on this side the six hundred,
The Pope, and Emperour, with
the whole world, were Sodainely and
Straungely, conuerted from the Faith
and Order which they were of viij. yeres
before, And (no Historie mentioning it)
were made of Pure Protestants, Grosse
Papists.
               Yea, not only of viij. yeres aboue the
vj.C. he maketh a sad rekoning towards
his Uantage, but of the vj.C. yere it self
(if he can bring D. Hardings testimonie
so low) he so vaunteth and braggeth, as
though either himself had the Uictorie,
Or els, nothing should be won or lost.
For, whereas D. Harding, for profe of y•
Church Seruice in a Straung Tongue,
and vnknowen to the Uulgare people,
and that also within the first vj.C. yeres,
alleaged the cumming of S. Augustine
the Monke and our Apostle into England,
(which was by his accompt the 14.
yere of Mauritius Emperor, & the 596.
of our Lord.) Master Iewel in answering
it sayeth.
               Of the 600▪ yeres after Christ,Iew. 192. whervpon

Iioyne wish him issue, Liberally, and of
his owne accord, he geueth me backe fiue
hundred, foure scoare and sixtene, And of
so greate a number (as 600. are) reserueth
vnto himself foure POORE YERES,Wretched craking.
and yet, is not very certaine of the same.
               
                  And then it foloweth. But if Marianus
Scotus accompt be true, that Augustine
came into this Realme not the fourtienth
of the Emperour Mauritius, but four yeres
after, which was iust the six hundred yere
after Christ: then he reserueth not one yere
to himselfe, but yeldeth me backe altogeather.
               Loe what a wise contention here is:Ra.
And how sadly M. Iewel foloweth it?
               Did he thinke with himselfe, that none,
but Children or Idiotes, would Reade
his Replie? And if he prouided to make
it so, as not only Wisemen should consider
it, but the Aduersarie also might 
                     •
                  e
answered by it: how could he for shame
of the world, so Trifle, and Wrangle, and
Set furth himselfe so much, vpon so litle
occasion? For, if the vj.C. yeres shall
trie the mater, he that cometh four yeres
before they be ended, commeth time inough
to confute M. Iewel. And his

Cause therefore being lost, Or his Bragging
at least confounded, if, in any time
before the vj.C. yeres expired, the contrarie,
to this Assertion, may be proued:
Why should he call them foure Poore
yeres, or set them at naught, which making
to the number of the first 600. yeres
are part of the yeres vpon which he ioyned
Issue, and are (by his apointement)
of greate Authoritie.
               
                  The crake herein is, like as if one
should say, In all S. Augustines workes,
you shal not finde this worde Missa, and
thervpon I wil ioyne with you: (as though
a great point of Diuinitie consisted herein.)
An other answeareth, yeas Mary,
I finde the worde in such, and such
Sermons.
                  
                  Ser. 137. de temp:
                  Then Replieth the Challēger:
Of so great a number of Tomes, as S. Augustine
hath writen, of so many bokes in
euery Tome. &c. (as far as his Rhetorike
permitteth) you geaue me backe, Liberally,
And of your owne accord, al the
sort of them almost, and reserue vnto your
selfe two POORE SERMONS: and yet
are you not very certaine of them, whether

they be S. Augustines or 
                     •
                  oe. As if he
should say, I layed hard to his charge, and
there was but two poore places betweene
me and the victorie, which, although he
hath ouer me, yet, it shal not be saied that
I lost it easely, and he shal not crake or triumph,
that he came lightly by it.
               Confer now this Example with M.
Iewels forsaied wordes. The place is
before thee, and being so plaine as it is,
it greueth me to spend time in Repe
                     •
                  ing
and Applying it.
               But M. Iewel goeth further, he will
not leaue so much as one yeres vantage
to D. Harding. For,
               If Marianus Scotus accompt be true.Iew. 192.
                  (Note here that you know not your selfe
what to answer absolutely) then M. Harding
reserueth not one yere to himself, but
yeldeth me backe altogeather.
               Goe to (M. Iewel) be it so.Ra. Let D.
Harding geaue 
                     •
                  uer all other vantage,
and let it be supposed (which yet is most
false) that he had brought nothing for the
profe of the Publike Seruice in the Uulgare
Tonge, biside this Historye, of S.

Augustines planting the Christian Religion
in England: Thus much only
then is concluded, y• iust in the vj.C. yere
after Christ (what so euer it was before)
The Publike Seruice was in some
place in such a tongue, as the vulgare
people did not vnderstande.
               
               And what now shall we say to it? Where
is the Uictorye?Nothing wonne or lost. On your side, or D.
Harding? But first it would be knowen
whether you, at the beginning, did take
the vj.C. yeres, Exclusiue or Inclusiue?
               
               And whether you meant, that if to the
last day of the six hundred yere, any thing
should be founde against you, you would
subscribe: Or els, that if your Aduersaries
Reason were not of an higher Date
than the first day of the last yere of the vj.
hundred, you would vtterly refuse it.
               Well, how so euer it be, it seemeth now
that it is but a deade victorie, Or a Stale
and that he which will checke M. Iewel,
must begin againe, If Marianus Scotus
accompt be true▪ &c. As, on the other
side, if it be false, then is he ouercummed
by four pore yeres yet, as he termeth thē.
               
                  
But consider now (Indifferent Reader)
whether this be manly Dealing or
no? To refuse the Authoritie that is at 
this present in the world? To set light 
by the Practise and Iudgement of the
Church for ix.Absurdities. hundred yeres space.
To pare euery thing so precisely by the firste 
six hundred yeres, that, If it be but a 
daie longer, it must be cut awaie: And if
it be a few yeres shorter, it must be the
lesse estemed: And if it answer iustly 
with the yere it self, it weigheth in no
side. What Reason hath M. Iewel, or
what Example and Scripture for him?
               Is the Truthe of God bound to the
first six hundred yeres?M. Iew. putteth Truthe within a Circle of yeres. And must it not
passe that cumpasse which M. Iewel hath
apointed vnto it? Is God a God of six
hundred yeres only, and not of all time
and all worldes? Was the Holyghost
promised to tary with vs, til vj.C. yeres
were come and gone, and not to the end
of the world? The kingdome of Christ,
which should be euerlasting, and his power
which should not be takē awai: must
it be interpreted now, to haue theyr full
terme out, in vj.C. yeres only?
               
                  
What Grace haue the first vj.C, Or
what curse of God haue these last .ix.C.
yeres? Now know you also, when the
first vj.C. ended, Or what trust haue you
in them, which number the yeres vnto
you? Some Historiographers recken
one way, Other recken an other way.
               What certaintie then can you haue of thē?
Again, those writers whome you folow,
either do at this present liue, Or he commended
vnto you by them that now line.
And how dare you trust, either those that
nowe liue and write of thinges so long
sens past: Or those, that a greate while
sens are deade, your selfe not then borne
to liue with them, and examine their doinges?
               Consider also, how many haue wryten
within the space of these last nine hūdred
yeres: how perfite in life, how Excellent
in knowledge, how Painfull in studies,
how Worthy in their owne dayes, How
Famous with the Posteritie, How mete
witnesses in the cause of God, and triall
of a Pure and holy Religion? Abbates,
Monkes, Friers, are in these new Gospelling
dayes, termes of great shame

and Ignominie: yet what sayeth and honest
Protestant, against S. Bernard, Rupertus,
Thomas Aquinas, Bonauenture,
Dionysius the Carthusian, and other such?
Can M. Iewel finde any fault in theyr
life, by any Report of brute or Fame? Or
any Irreligiousnes in their bookes and
wrytinges, which are extant, for hym to
consider? Let him say his worst, Let him
leaue poring in Gloses of no Authoritie,
to finde some mad thing or other, against
the wisedome of the Church, And let him
confer his leisure to Reading or Examining
rather of these Witnesse (according
to the State he taketh vpon him) whose
sayinges, he knoweth, we esteeme as we
ought to doe.
               O, sayeth he, these were of late daies.
I graunt▪ And not only that, but also,
and you will, that they were in euyll and
corrupt daies. But were they corrupted
in them? Did they not write against corrupt
liuing? Did they suffer new Preachers
and Apostolikes, to goe out of the
Church or come against ye church by their
euil Doctrine? Or did they communicate
with Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots

or any other of all the world in their liuing?
Seing they neither f
                     •
                  ared hatred
nor curred Fauour, why should not their
Testimonie be receiued, no other exception
being brought against them, but
that they liued in so late daies, or such A
world?
               All is Ungodly, All is Unreasonable,
All is Uaineglorious, to appeale to the
 times so long past, As though that God,
at this present, had not his Church in the
 world: Or, as though ye could well folow
any other, but such as you heare
 with our owne eares: Or, as though
the good and Lerned men of these Later
yeres, departed this world hundred of
yeres sens, were not as nigh to the first
six hundred yeres as ye are, and as ready
 to folow the best waie as ye: Or, as
though it were A Ioly mater and a compendious
waie to the Gospell, to contempne
all Christendome that now is,
and holde with that Christendome that
was almoste a thousand yeres sens, not
knowing yet, what Christianitie meaneth,
Nor Daring to trust it if ye knew
it, were it not for the Authoritie which is

at this present in Christendome, the
Greatnesse of which hath moued you to
beleue, what so euer you beleue vpon any
good ground.
               Here therfore M. Iewel, defend your
doinges, And shew vs the cause, wherefore
you doe, or should refuse the Testimonie
of the last ix. hundred yeres which
are against you. If it be not for Childeshnesse,
or Wantonesse, or Unsensiblenesse,
that you will none of so many
and so graue Witnesses: yet except you
alleage some honest cause and reason, It
will remayne, I beleue, that you doe it
vpon a very blinde Stomake and contention.

                  s are short, and
easy to be answered, if you haue any
Faith or Conscience at all. As in Example.

the world, when you were borne?
               Did not the Greatnes, Grauitie and
Authoritie of Nations which were of it,
moue you to beleue?
               Did the Inuisible and litle Congregation
worke that effect in you?
               If ye trusted the Catholike Church of

your time, in commending Christ vnto
you, and without her Commendatyon
would not haue credited him: can you,
with a safe consciēce, contemne the voice
of the same Church, And, to colour your
defection and Fleeing from it, take holde
fast of the first six hundred yeres only, As
though you could with all your witte,
iudge better what the Primitiue Church
thought and beleued, than the present
Church which is of one Spirite wth
the Primitiue. &c.
               But there is no Remedie, vpon the
first six hundred yeres M. Iewel ioyneth
with vs, And if any thing be longer
than that measure, he will none of it: he
hath sayed it.
            
            
               
               ¶How M. Iewel himselfe dothe vse
the Testimonies of what so euer

other to the first sixe hundred

               TO the first six hundred yeres cumpasse

Reason and Conscience, but

and the Refusing to encountre with him
vpon his conditions, shallbe thought of
some Iudges to be A Preiudice vnto our
cause, and A greate Argument that our
hartes faile vs?
               Dispute (sayeth the Heretike) wyth
me, vpon these questions, whether the
Publike Seruice in an vnknowen tongue,
Or Receiuing vnder one kinde, Or Reseruing
of the Sacrament in A Pix wyth
A Canopie ouer it▪ &c. Was euer vsed
in the Primitiue Church. No Mary

(would I saie, if it were to me only), I
will not Dispute with thee vpon thees
                     •
                  
poyntes. But, if thy Hart and Learning
serue thee, make few wordes and
Answer me, from whence thou c

                  mest?
Who sent thee?Reasonable Demaundes.
What are their Names?
Where are their Sees? What is their
Succession? What is their Authoritie?
In which pointes if thou satisfie me, not
only then, in these few Articles which
thou demaundest, but in euery point and
part of the Religion, which thy Church
aloweth, I will be Faithfull and Obedient.
               
                   Dispute (sayeth he againe vnto me)
on Munday come seuennight. And before
that Day cummeth, he chaingeth his
minde foure or fiue times with me.
               First he will Dispute in Latine: Then
he will wryte his minde, and speake nothing:
After that, he wil haue the mater
Reasoned in Englishe, and wise men
shalbe Iudges: And, after that againe,
he will haue it done in the hearing of the
people, not by quicke Disputation, but
by Reading only the Argumentes out of
a Booke.
               
                  
If the Catholike Disagree in anye
poynt, and stand vpon it: either stubburnesse,
either Mistrust of his Cause,
either some fault or other, shalbe layed
vnto him. And so were many greate
and heighnous maters Obiected against
S. Ambrose,Ambr. lib. 5. because he refused to haue
the cause betwene himselfe and the Heretike
Auxentius,Ep. 33. to be tried in the Consistorie
of the Emperour, before Secular
Iudges. And his Exception, against
the Place only and Audience, was accompted
an high and intolerable Treason.
               In like maner: You shall Dispute 
with me (sayeth the Heretike,) and nothing
shall serue you, except it be in expresse
Scripture. If the Catholike refuse
that Condition, and allege an hundred
Reasons and Authorities, that we
must bele

                  e the vnwriten veritie, as wel

whether it be deliuered vnto vs by Tradition,
or left vnto vs in Wryting: Yet
except he yeld at length, all England shal
ring of it, That the Papistes will not be

tried by the linely worde of God, That
they flee the light, That they dare not
commit their cause to the Scriptures.
               
                   To be short, when M. Iewel now,
more Reasonably in deede than Some of
his Masters or Felowes, which will
admit nothing but Scripture: Yet heretically
and stately inough, pro
                     •
                  oketh vs
to ioine with him, And chooseth his questions,
and excludeth all our Answers
vnto them, except they be taken iust out
of the v
                     •
                  .C. yeres after Christ: although
it be very vniustly required of him, and
A Catholike should neuer come into such
bondage, Or not alwaies condescend in
these lesser pointes vnto A Protestant:
Yet, if he striue long with him about it,
and stand in the Defence of the last nine
hundred yeres, alleaging many and them
good causes, wherefore the Testimonie
and consent of so long time should be alowed,
the longer he striueth, the worse
shall he be esteemed for it, and the ernest
mainteining of euery Truth on his side,
shall goe in Print abrode for an Argument,
that in dede he hath no good right.
               
                  
Be it so then, The Catholike must let
goe the vantage of ix.C. yeres, he must
fight within that time and cumpasse that
the Heretike prescribeth: And although
that naturally, al men are more fauorable,
to them that are called in to the law,
than the suers and troblers of them, and
suffer the defendant, whome worldly
frindship cleane forsaketh, to haue as
much right as his cause will geaue him:
Yet, let all thinges be forgoten, which
may commend the Catholikes, and as
M. Iewel hath appointed, so, let the
first six hundred yeres only be considered
and alowed.
               But here now let me aske one Question.
As it not Reason,A most reasonable condition. like as our aduersarie
prescribeth vnto vs, the number
and Terme of yeres, out of which
we must gather our Argumentes: that
so likewise he, shuld not come against vs
with any Testimony or Authority, which
were out of those apointed Limites and
boundes of yeres? If a Challenger shall
say to the Partye whome he Prouoketh,
come, let vs straite waies trie the mater

betwene our selues in the plaine Fielde,
and bring thou thy Sword and Buckler
as I will mine: when they are agreed,
vpon the Time, Place, and kind of Weapon,
if the Challenger would, against the
others single sworde, come with sword,
dager, horse, spere, Dagge, and what so
euer defence or helpe he could get 
                     •
                  yside,
should he not be compted Awretched and
Contentious, and A glorious Iacke
Bragger? He that biddeth the combat,
seemeth to take himself for the better mā,
and to like his owne cause and quarell
very wel: how Ignominious then and
Shamefull must it be vnto him, not to
fight vpon equall conditions with hys
Aduersarie?
               Reason you against me (sayeth M.
Iewel) out of the first six hundred yeres
only: but I for all that, will be at my libertie
to vse any Testimonie out of the
xv.C. and odde yeres sens Christ. Which
in very deede is as much to say, as knele
you here vpon one knee, and Fight not
out of this Circle which I make to you,
As for my selfe I will goe or run at my

pleasure about you, and take my vantage
where I can finde it, sometimes within,
sometimes without the Circle, sometimes
stāding nigh, sometimes coursing about
the field.
               Mary Sir, if such Priuileges might
be graunted to Warriers, it were an easie
mater to prolong the Battell, and to
winne the praise of much manlinesse, by
spurring cut hither and thither, and no
mater how. For, he taketh no care
hereof, how truly he alleage, the Testimonies
of these last nine hundred yeres,
Or how worthie and approued Authors
they be, whom he alleageth, but without
exception he taketh all that he findeth,
and from the highest to the lowest, from
the Text to the Glose, and emong Gloses
from the best to the worst of them, he
Taketh, and Draweth, and Heapeth against
vs, Al that may seeme to helpe his
Assertions.
               Tel vs therefore (I pray you M. Iewel)
what Equitie or Conscience you folow?
Will you binde the Catholikes, to
the first six hundred yeres, And wil your
selfe argue out of cumpasse? May not

we vse the worthie Authoritie of Bonifacius,
because he was Bishop of Rome
in the yere of our Lord 680, and will you
admit the sayinges and doinges of Luther,
Zwinglius and Caluine, all condemned
Persons; through the Catholike
Church, and liuing xv.C yeres after
Christ?
               S. Bernard (you say) was A man of
late yeres. So was Dionisius the Carthusian,
So were others, whom I haue
rekened vp, in the chapiter before: And
therefore, by your accompt, of lesse Authoritie.
And why then doe you all
                     •
                  age
not only S. Bernard,Iewel. but Durand, Gerson,
Alexander,260 Lynwod, Camotensis,
Hugo Cardinalis,195. Eckius, Aeneas Syluius,
Erasmus,150. and other? I report me
to the very margine of your boke,199 by that
it will appeere,175. whether you do not stuffe
your boke,177 with Canons, Constitutions,
Gloses,10. Histories, Interpretations of
scripture, Testimonies of Fathers, Opinions
of Scholemen. &c. such as altogether
you scrape out of these last nine C.
yeres. For which your so doing, if you

can bring any Reason, or shew any Speciall
Pryuilege graunted to you, against
the law of Nature, that you might do against
an other, that, which you would
not haue done to your selfe: either, of this
vnreasonable Fauor and Licence, you
must geaue some cause, or els you must
suffer vs to complaine of it, that you dele
not with vs Indifferently.
               But it will be thought, perchaunse, of
others, that you alleage not y• later Wryters,
of any time these nine C. yeres, for
the Estimation or Credite, which you
haue them in, but only, because your Aduersary
maketh great Price of them.
               Suppose it were so: yet you doe him
greate Wronge, to put him to Answering
of more Witnesses, than he should
doe by right: And to fill your Replie
with those mennes sayinges, whose Authorit
                     •
                  es
though he doe not contemne,
yet he would not haue them to possesse,
& occupie y• place, which more Auncient
and worthier Persons should haue. And
although we think as it becometh vs, of
s. Bernard, s., Bonauēture, S. Denyse. &c.

Yet, if you would needes haue vs in
Reasoning with you, not to passe the
Boundes and Terme of vj.C. yeres, you
shoulde not, though we alowed the Persons
neuer so much, bring any of A lower
degree and later age against vs, either
to stand in the place which S. Hierome,
S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, or S. Chrysostome
should occupie, either to commend
that place the better by their Presence,
which the Auncient Fathers of the
Primitiue Church, doe furnishe aboundantly
by themselues: and which also
they only should furnishe, by your appointement.
And further I say, that if
you will not suffer me to take any vantage
against you, by the testimony of any
good Man or wryter of the nine hundred
yeres last past, it is no equalitie, that,
whther I will or no, you should make
me to Answer the sayinges, which you
bring against me, out of those yeres whiche
you passe not vpon. And whereas
it shall doe me no good, though I proue,
that S. Bernard (for Example) in that
place which you wil alleage, doth not only
not hinder, but allso further my cause:

to what purpose should I spend anyetime
at all, in hearing or examining hys
wordes, which, although I declare to
make for me, may not be lawfully vsed
of me?
               And therefore, notwithstanding you
iudge truly of vs herein and better of vs
than of your self, that we, the Catholikes,
doe not refuse the Authoritie of later Fathers
and Doctours, whom the Church
yet neuer condemned or despised: Yet,
this our credite which we haue them in,
must not serue you for any cause or excuse,
why ye should bring them furth against
vs, except we may doe the like against
you. For, as you haue appealed
to the first vj.C. yeres, thereby to let vs
of our Libertie, so we doe require you also,
not to passe that nūber or cumpasse of
those yeres, thereby to cut away your superfluitie.
And in thus doing, we are
not weary of the later Doctours of Christendome,
nor afraid of their Iudgments
but we are offended with your vainglorious,
and very wretched behauioure,
which will not keepe the law yourselfe,
that you prescribe vnto other.
               
                  
Ther is, I graunt, A kind of Argumēt
ad hominem, non ad rem, to the man not
to the mater. As, to some of our Countrie
men, at this present, and them of the
most Perfite and exquisite Trade, in folowing
of the Gospel, if A Catholike doe
saye, that Father Caluine himself, (whose
Iudgment is much praised in the Congregation,)
was of this mind,Com: 
                        •
                     , Amos and was
also Zelous in it, that they did very ill,
which ga
                     •
                  e to king Harry the viij. that
he should be head of the Church: this argument
so taken of his Authoritie, that
was a Proude, and Folishe, And Lousie
Heretike, although it be nothing worth
in deede, and in that respect not to be vsed
of A Catholike, Yet, to him that accompteth
of Caluine, as if he had bene
one of ye lights of the World, y• Catholike
may right wel vse it, & driue him by force
of the Consequence, either to deny Caluines
Authority (which he wil not) Or y•
kings supremacy (which he dareth not.)
So y• against him, that is addicted to any
one Opinion of his own, or of other whō
he buildeth vpon, to bring an Argument
grounded vpō his own Opinion & iudgment,

& thereby to make him forsake his
own opinion, or kepe stil in his memory
the Contradiction which inwardly pincheth
him: It is A kind of Reasoning,
good and profitable.
               And, in this respect, if any Catholike
were so blinde & singular, as to set more
by the Glose vpon Vnā Sanctā, Extr. de Maior
& Obed▪
                   than the Commentaries of S.
Hierome, and S. Chrisostome: Or by
Durand, Gerson, Lynwod. &c. than any
of the most Auncient Fathers: M. Iewel
then, might be suffered to argue ad hominem,
that is, to alleage Gloses, Scholemen
and later Doctours, to him that hath
A speciall fansie vnto those, more than any
of the Primitiue Church. But now, se
y• Inequality & ods. For neither D. Har
                     •
                  nor
his Inferiors, are so ignorāt of y• sēse
& strength of this word Catholike, y• they
shuld be addicted to any one, two, or thre
mens priuate sayings of what degree or
time so euer they haue ben, (without th
                     •
                  
consent or warrant of the Church) neither
shuld M. Iewel alleage vnto them,
any Testimony of the last nine hundred
yeres, himself referring the triall of the

the whole mater to the first vj.C. only.
And hauing such Aduersaries, as are very
well content, to be ordered by the sentence
and Iudgment of that first age, and
that Primitiue Church.
               Yet go to for a while, let M. Iewel be
suffered: And let it be his excuse, that he
hath argued alwaies ad hominem, to the
man, when he hath vsed the Testimonies
of later times, thereby to impugne D.
Harding. Let him say (I meane) that
he hath recited in his Replye, Durand,
Gerson, Biel, Denyse, Hugo Cardinall,
Thomas Duns. &c. not, because himself
aloweth them, but, because they are estemed
of y• party against whō he wryteth.
               But is this true? And hath not he vsed
their Testimonies in respect also of hys
owne opinion, & confirmed himself in it,
because of their Testimonies? When he
reasoneth Substantially, and Directly,
and Plainly to his Purpose, and ad rem
to the mater, and out of his owne Principles
(as it were) and Authorities, doth
he not alleage the forsayde Doctours, although
they were, all the sort of them,
farre vnder the first six hundred yeres,

to whiche onely he would haue the Decision
of the controuersies referred? Whether
this be so or no, let Examples try it.
               
                  M. Iewel is of the Opinion that no
Christian Churches wer built in the Apostles
tyme:Iew. 19
                        •
                     . And muche lesse then Aulters
(if his Logicke be good.) For may wee
thinke (sayth he) that Aulters were built
before the Churche? Of whiche Lye,In the Chapiter of Lyes. we
shall speake in an other place. But to my
purpose. It foloweth in him:
               
               Neyther afterward,Iew. when Aulters were
first vsed, and so named, were they straite
waye built of Stone, as Durandus and such
others saie, they must needes be, and that,
Quia petra erat Christus, Because Christ vvas
the Stone.
               
               Whereof then were they built,Ra. according
to your Opinion? And what Cause
or Authoritie haue you for it? It foloweth.
               For Gerson saith,Iew. that Siluester Bisshop
of Rome, first caused Stone Aultars to be
made. &c.
               Is Gerson then,Ra of Authoritie with
you? And a man of so late yeares, and
little Fame and Estimation, in comparison

of many Fathers and Doctours of
the ix.C. yeares last past, all which you
refuse, is hee nowe a witnesse for your
                     •
                  
Here it is plaine that you bring in this
late writer, to serue directly your owne
Opinion, and, that he standeth you
in suche steede, that without him, you
proue not that whiche you saide.
               You depende not therefore vppon
your Aduersaries allowing of Gerson.
as who shoulde saye: if he admit the Testimonie
of him, then doe I confirme my
Assertion, and if he doe not, yet haue I
other Authorities to proue my sayinges
true: but, you doe so absolutely and proprely
for your owne Opinion vse him,
that without him, you leaue your matters
vnproued. But let vs see an other
Example.
               It is required of M. Iewell, that
forasmuche as the Catholikes coulde neuer
yet finde, that the Publike Seruice
in the Primitiue Churche, was in any
other than Greeke or Latine, and hee
yet is sure of the Contrarye, that it was
euery where in a tongue knowen to the

Uulgare People: he shew therefore his
Profes and Authorities, suche by all
likelyhode, as himselfe is perswaded
withall, before he woulde haue other to
allowe them. Marke then what hee
sayth.
               And,Iew. 175. to auoyde multitude of woordes,
the case beeing plaine,Eckius in locis Com. Durand. lib. 4. ca. 1. Nicolaus Lyra. Thomas in. 1. ad Cor. 14. Eckius sayth, the
Indians had their Seruice, in the Indian
tongue, Durandus saith, The Iewes, that
were Christened, had their Seruice in the
Hebrew tongue.
               Nycolas Lyra, and Thomas de Aquine,
saye, The Common Seruice in the Primitiue
Churche was in the Common vulgare
tongue.
               And in the next leafe folowing, he aleageth
Aeneas Syluius and an Extrauagant
de Officio Iudicis Ordinarij.177. and Iohn
Billet in Summa de Diuinis officijs.
               But what are all these?Ra. Were they
not writers of very late Yeares? Were
they not Popisshe Doctours, or Popysshe
Proctours, not woorthe the

naming (by M. Iewels Accompt) and
much lesse worth the Crediting? Why thē
doth he alleage them? Will he saye, he
condescended herein to D. Hardinges
Infirmitie? And, that he vseth his owne
Doctours for the better contentation of
his mind? No verely he must not say so.
For he was required to bring his owne
groundes and witnesses, and not such,
as are alowed only per accidens, that is,
because it so happeneth, that an other mā
liketh them. He was content allso to
shew his profes, and to yeld to the foresaid
Request, both for the goodnesse and
pregnancie of the cause,Iew. 175. and also specially,
Good Christian Reader, (sayeth he,) for
the better Contentation of thy mind.
               
               If the cause then be good and pregnāt,
why vse you so ill and baren Testimonies,
as all theirs are (if your accompt
be true) which come furth, after the first
six hundred yeres? And, if you seeke after
the Contentation of your Readers
mind, you signifie thereby, that the Authorities,
which you alleage, are worthy
and alowable. Not, because Doctor

Harding will make no Exception, perchaunce,
against them, but because yourselfe
like them and esteeme them.
               Otherwise, what Contentation of the
Readers mind, call you this, to Reason
vpon their Authorities, whom yourself
would haue to be contemned? Or, to
establish any opinion vpō such groundes
vpon which you can build nothing, except
vnto him, which holdeth them for
sure and good? Of which sort of men,
you make not (I trust) euery your good
Christian Reader to be. Especially, many
of them, by your oft Appealing to the
first six hundred yeres, being occasioned,
to set litle by anye Testimonie of lower
time and degree.
               Thus we see againe, that M. Iewel
hath vsed the late wryters Testimonie
Eckius, Durand, Thomas Aquinas,
and Iohn Billet, not, because of D.
Hardinges opinion or regard of them
(which how greate or litle it is, he dothe
not know) but, because of his owne liking
of them.
               Neither doth he peeke (as it were) an

occasion to vse them, out of his Aduersaries
estimation of them, but whether
D. Harding aloweth them or no, M.
Iewell flatly vseth them, nor is ashamed
of the latenes of them. A thing,
at other times so materiall with hym,
that on paine of forfaiting all a mans labour,
none must be brought in for witnesses,
but suche as are, within little, a
thowsand yeare olde.
               See one place more and with that, we
shall ende this Chapiter. It is a question
betweene the Catholikes and the
Heretikes, Whether the woordes of
Christe, in the sixt of S. Iohn, are to
be vnderstanded, onely of the spirituall
eating of his body, Or of the Spirituall
and Sacramentall bothe. The firste
is the newe Maisters, the seconde is the
Olde Fathers. To proue the firste,
that the wordes of our Sauiour in that
Chapiter, are taken and meant of spirituall
eating onely, Thus sayth Maister
Iewell.
               For to leaue S. Augustine,Iew. 104 Origine, and
others of that age: Nicolas Lyra, a man of
later yeres saith, The said words of Christ,

must needes be taken Spiritually, and none
otherwise.
               Lykewise, one Michael Vaehe, one of
late yeares, a man of M. Hardings owne
syde, touching the same matter, wryteth
thus (against Luther.) This saith he, is
a weake reason, for, the woordes, that
be spoken of Spirituall eating▪ He Applieth
to the Sacramentall eating. Here may
M. Harding see, besydes S. Augustine,
Origine, and other olde Catholike Fathers,
whose Woordes I haue not aleaged,
what men he hathe called Newe
Maisters. Nicolas Lyra, was an Englisshe
man, and liued two hundred yeares before
Luther. Michaell Vaehe, was of late
yeares, and wrote namelye against Luther.
               Heere I trowe,Ra. it is perceaued that
M. Iewell vseth late writers Testimonies,
in defence of his syde. The question
is, whether the sixt of S. Iohn,
be vnderstanded of Spirituall eatinge
onely or no. If it be, let vs set your
Authorities (M. Iewell) and reasons.
               The new masters (as D. Hard. tearmeth
them) expound it so. Thei are not all
new masters (say you) that haue so takē th
                        •
                     
                  
                  
How proue you that? For Nicolas Lyra
(You Aunswere) saith it▪
                   and one Michael
Vaehe one of late yeares.
                  M. Iew. belieth his witnesses. They saye it
not, that it is to be vnderstanded onely
of Spirituall eating, but of Spirituall
eating without ONELY. Suppose
yet they saide it, what were that to purge
the new Maisters of the fault of Singularitie,
or to perswade your Reader that it
must be so taken? I doe not disprayse
neither Nicolas Lyra, neither Michaell
Uehe, but I can not but mislike it greatly
in you, to aleage their Names in your
defense, whose Authorities are neyther
Excellent, nor Yeares Auncient. Especially,
whereas you would seeme to haue
S. Augustine, Origine, and others of that
age, to stande with you in this matter.
But you leaue them and come to Nicolas
Lyra.
               What doe you M. Iewel? Is there
any man, in all the Catholike Churche,
whiche will giue you leaue,M. Iew. leaueth S Augustine &c. 
                        •
                      foloweth Nicolas Lyra: to answere
him rather by Nicolas Lyra, then S.
Augustine? And dothe it become your
Manheade and Corage, (whiche is so
great, that you will haue Controuersies

examined by no later writers, then those
of the first six hundred yeares,) thus to
leaue, S. Augustine (whose Authoritye
is worthelye regarded of all wise men)
and cleane to Nicolas Lyra, whose testimony
any man (except it be of contempt)
may lawfully let alone with out vsing or
alowing of it? You commend hym to vs
in two poyntes, He was (you saye) An
English man, and liued two hundred yeres
before Luther. I haue reade the contrarye,
that he was a Iew, borne at Liere:
neuerthelesse if you for Countrye sake (as
borne perchaunce in the old or new Iury
in Londō) or for Age sake, as liuing two
hundred yeres before Luther, doe thynke
that he is a worthy witnesse to Englishe
men of this age, I will not reproue your
kindnesse of hart towardes your Countrymen,
nor affection to the time later by
seuen hundred yeres than the Primityue
church vnto which you apeale so precisely:
But this, who can abyde? To consider
M. Iuell, so great a Contemner of
later Dyuines and Scholemen, to leaue
S. Augustine,Absurde. Origen and others, and to
defend hys felowes, by Nycolas Lyra and

Michaell Vaehe? And not onely that, but
to crake (as it were) that S. Augustin
is also with him, and yet not so muche as
to name the Place where it might bee
sought and founde. For consider his
wordes.
               Here maye M. Hardinge see besydes
S. Augustine,104 Origene, and other olde
Catholike Fathers, whose wordes I haue
not allegaed,M. Iew. belieth himselfe. what men he hath called New
Maisters.
               In deede,Ra. hee may see that you ha
                     •
                  e
brought furth, Nycolas Lyra, and one
Michael Vaehe: but y• he may se them, bysydes
S. Augustine, Origene, and other
Olde Catholike Fathers, Howe is it possible?
For your selfe confesse, that, you
haue not alleaged their wordes. And how
then shoulde he see them? If D. Harding
doe no more, but quote onely the
Places of the Doctours, in whiche his
sayengs be verefied, And leaue the writing
out of their whole Sentences: all
this (you wil say) is but a Camissado,I
                           •
                        w. 6. these
be but visardes: They be no faces: They
are brought in, like Mummers, for a shew,
and say nothing. And what pretie Coū
                  terfeiting

may we call this, to alleage A
later writers saying fully, and not so
much as quote the place of the olde Fathers:
And yet, to make an O
                     •
                  tentation
with, here may M. Harding see, bysides S.
Augustine, Origen, and other old Catholike
Fathers whose wordes I haue not alleged,
what men he hath called new masters?
Uerely, this is biside all reason, to tel me
that bysides S. Augustine &c. I may See
what Nycolas Lyra testifieth, wher no one
Sentence or Halfe sentence of S. Augustines
is to be Seen, Heard, or Understanded,
in the place on which I am bid
to looke.
               But,This is worse than mūmery. 
                  I haue not alleged their wordes,
sayeth M. Iewel. And why did you not,
I pray you, Sir? Were you in such hast to
come to Nycolas Lyra and Michael Vaehe,
that you could not cary with S. Augustin,
Origene, and other old Catholike Fathers?
Is it your maner of writing, to spare the
Alleging of old Fathers? Or, was their
word, not worth the hearing? Or, must
we needes beleue your Assertion, without
further euidence? The Truthe is,
neither Saint Augustine, nor Origen,

nor any other old Catholike Fathers did
precisely say, that the sixth of S. Ihon,
must be vnderstanded only of the Spiritual
eating of Christes fleshe. And you,
although you could not haue their voyces,
yet you were so bold as to vse their
Names: And pretending, as thoughe it
were easie to see, that they did testifie for
you, so, you leaue them quite and cleane,
and bring in, Nycolas Lyra an Englisheman,
and Michael Uaehe of late yeres,
to speake somewhat for you.
               Consider now (Indifferent Reader)
whether M. Iewel vseth the later Wryters,
as Necessary Witnesses in his owne
cause, or no? And whether he bringeth
them in, as Men whom D. Harding is
well content withall, Or as Persons,
without whom, his sayinges, could haue
no Probalitie at all? For, if he had alleged,
first S. Augustine, Origen, and other
old Catholike Fathers, and afterwardes,
had rehersed the Opinions and Iudgmentes
of later writers: he might haue
ben thought to haue done it for A Surplussage,
and to haue sought thereby, to
perswade rather his Aduersarie, than to

Confirme his owne Assertion. But on
the other side now, to leaue S. Augustine,
Origen and other Fathers, and to stay only
vpon Lyra and Uaehe, what other
thing is it, than to Protest that by their
Testimonies his cause is Sufficientlye
proued? And, to take vantage of their
sayinges, which liued out of the six hundred,
next after Christ? And, this is that
which deserueth iust Indignation, that
any man, bearing the Person and Face,
of one that had discretion or Conscience,
should bind an other to a certaine compasse
of Time and Yeres, which, in no
case, he should passe, in Debating of any
controuersie: And yet, would in the
meane Time himselfe, Argue, Reason,
and Conclude, out of any Time, and require
to haue it stand, for profe good and
sufficient, of his owne Assertions: And to
vse that kind of Libertie or Prerogatiue,
not only when he speaketh ad hominem,
that is, to the Meaning, Sense, Opinion,
or Fancie of the man, with whom he
hath to doe, but also, ad rem, that is, according
to his owne Meaning & Iudgment,
in which, he taketh the testimonies

by himselfe alleaged, to perteine, Directly,
and in deede, to Confirmation of the
cause, which he susteineth.
               Yet (as I saied before) let M. Iewels
excuse be, that he hath vsed Late w
                     •
                  yters
Testimonies, not for any stay of his own
Opinions (the contrary whereof I haue
shewed) but to stop only D. Hardinges
mouthe, and to set one Papist against an
other, Let him so saie, and let vs so take
it: yet, is this no indifferent dealing.
For, if he wil bind vs to the first six hundred
yeres, and himselfe yet, will presse
vs with Authorities of later age, either
he mindeth that we shall Answer him in
them, or holde our peace and be still.
               If we shall answer: why apointed he
the Lymites of six hundred yeres to be
kept of vs? For, when he prouoketh vs,
with mater collected out of the cumpasse
of them, we must needes come also out of
them, and ioyne with him, therevpon.
               And, if he minded that we should not
at all Answer him, and that himselfe yet,
would Obiect suche Testimonies vnto
vs: Why did he then Obiect them? Except
we shall Iudge of him, that he is so

Folishe, as to apoint it, or so Proude and
Stately, as to conceiue it, that it maye be
lawfull for him, in fighting against his
Aduersarie, to haue certaine Places open
vnto his Desperate Foynes, and that no
Warding of the Daunger, and no Buckler
should be vsed. And therefore,
               It is not to be graunted vnto you M.
Iewel, to Bind vs to the first six hundred
yeres, And to be Loose yourselfe,
concerning any witnesse or Authoritie, of
the nine hundred folowinge: To set vs
within a Circle, and yourselfe to Discourse
out of Order and Cumpasse: To
forbid vs, the Alleaging of S. Bernard,
and yet to charge vs with the Opinion
of Michael Uehe, or any such other. No
Sir: to the first six hundred you haue
Appealed, to the first six hundred only,
you shall stand.
               If you wil Replie, they be our owne
Doctoures, and therefore we maye not
Refuse them: We Answer shortly vnto
you, that whereas in your Singulare
Iudgement they be no Doctoures at
all, And whereas you will not Suffer
them to be O
                     •
                  res, Or that we maie

alleage them and recite thē as our own:
we therefore in this Case and State of
Reasoning with you, doe not take them
for our owne. Yea, they must be so compted
vpon and so set aside, as if they wer
no mens witnesses at all, Because you, in
Drawing the mater to the first six hundred
yeres only, doe Import and Conclude
thereby, that, of al later Times and
Writers, you would haue A sad Silence
to be agreed vpon, and kept.
               But, where will M. Iewels Glorie
be then? And, if he himselfe shall vse no
Testimonie vnder the first vj.C. yeres:
how litle wil his Replie be? How vncertaine
must his Answers be? How greate
Blindnes and Silence must he come vnto?
Take away from M. Iewel, and his
felowes the last nine hundred yeres, and
you take away from them the Flowers
of their Diuinitie.The flowers of the new Gospell. Out of those yeres,
they Rake all the euill that is spoken, of
Popes, Cardinals, Priestes. &c. that by
reueling other mennes Turpitude, they
may commend their owne bare Honesties.
Out of those, come many Canons
of Councels, Constitutions of Emperours,

Uarieties of Historiographers,
Conclusions and Distinctions of Schole
men, in the number of which, it is easy to
find somewhat, alwaies, that shall sound
against the Catholikes. Either, because
all thinges, are not to be taken as they
lie, but neede an Interpretation: either
because, when many write of one Fact,
Or intreate of one mater, they do not alwaies
so throughly agree, in euery point
of the Historie or Question, but that he,
whome it Pleaseth to striue therevpon
with an other, may sone find A doubt Or
Argument to serue his humor of Contradiction.
Out of those, many Gloses
are peeked, so Obscure or Trifling, that
were it not, for the Diligence of Heretikes,
which haue brought them furth in
to light, They would as litle haue ben
sought for of the Catholikes, As they are
now litle estemed of them, when they are
Found out and shewed to them by the
Heretikes.
               Take therefore, the wrytinges of the
last nine hundred yeres, awaye from the
Protestantes, and there must needes folow,
such lacke of mater, to make vp

their Tales, that they will sone be at an
end, both in writing and in Preachinge.
And, not only concerning their ill Purposes:
(As, to bring either the Departed
into hatred, by opening their faultes, Or
them that at this Present line, into Infamie,
by charging them with the faultes
of their Forefathers (but, concerning also
good and holsome Lawes, Decrees,
Definitions, Orders of Gouernement,
Customes, Ceremonies, which haue ben

nothing, that is testified by the Writings
and Practise of them, shall stand in any
steede to make a Sentence or Argumēt:
what Confusion, Contention, Destruction,
Blindnesse, Desperatnesse, will be
caused in both States, Spirituall and
Temporall, It is easy to be percea
                     •
                  ed.
               What Church shall keepe her Priuileges?
what Clergie continue in any Order
of Seruing God? what King or Emperour,
maineteine the Crowne vpon
his heade? what state of Common wealth
in all Christendome maye be defended?
               If, the Recordes, Wrytinges, Answers,

Decrees, Actes, Dispensations, Conclusions,
and Lawes of the last nine hundred
yeres, must be, all, either vtterly refused,
Or beter Examined before they
be receiued?
               For in these later yeres, Countries
haue ben conuerted: Religion hath ben
Planted: Heresies, by the Authoritie of
Councels, haue ben condemned: The
Empire, hath ben translated: Our owne
Realme of England hath ben conquered,
And, in all these so greate pointes, the
Iudgmente and Sentence of the Pope
hath alwaies ben regarded. And that,
which at this day is holden for Truth,
in A thousand cases both Spirituall and
Temporall, dependeth in deede vpon the
Decree and Order, which the Gouernors
of the Church for that time, made for it
and apointed, when the case was first moued,
Or exhibited.
               If therefore, no Authoritie or Testimonie
of these later nine hundred yeres,
must be admitted, let M. Iewel with all
his owne wit, And Policy of his frendes
byside, see how he can begin the World
a freshe.
               
                  
And, the foundation of six hundred yeres
standing on sure grounde, let him pull
downe all, that hath beene builded, and
shew vs some fyne pe
                     •
                  ce of worke of his

vntill he come vnto this very time,
in whiche he liueth, and geue men to see
moste plainly and euidently, that his
Churche now, is of the same makinge,
without any Imperfection, Or gaping
of the worke that may be espied. Let
him I say make an Uniforme and Apte
worke.
               For if he will beginne at the ende of
the six Hundred yeares, and immediately,
ioyne thereto, the state of His Congregation
at this Present: either it will
be a Miraculous worke to see foundacions

                  ilfauoured matter, to see one peece
hanging so farre from the other, as Germans

of Heretikes lippes doe hange togeather.
If therefore your building be
Sure and True, Ioine yeres to yeres,
and without all gappes or holes, make
the whole, Perfite, Close, and One.
               But ye are as wel able to doe it, and
knit or ioine your Church to the Primitiue,
as ye are to builde vp againe, Al the
Abbeies in England, Or proue vnto vs
that the Stones of them, which lie now
broken in high waies, or were caried out
of the waie, to building of Gentelmens
places, doe answer rightly in the forme
which they haue at this present, to the
Foundations and Pillers, remainyng,
yet, vnto some Religious houses, from
whence they haue ben taken. Especially
this Principle of your Artificio
                     •
                  snes
standing, that the Testimonie of these
last nine hundred yeres, is not to be Alleaged
or Alowed.
               Which being so Uniust and Unreasonable,
as I haue declared, Either, let M.
Iewel vtterly put out of his Replye,
what so euer he hath gathered and scraped,
out of Canons, Gloses, Scholemen,

Heretikes, Historiographers, and other
Wryters whatsoeuer of later yeres, And
from hensefurth, fill no more Papers
with such kind of stuffe: Either els, let
him be ashamed, to bind vs to the first
six hundred only, himselfe not able to
Conteine himselfe, Or Maintaine hys
cause, within that cumpasse.
               But, I know, I aske his losse. For, If
he may not peeke out of all times such
Signes of Defence for his cause, as ma
                     ••
                  
seeme to serue for it, he will be quickly
vndone in the best Limme he hath, And,
without all doubt will be 
                     •
                  ongtied. As,
on the other side, If he will set vs haue
right, and suffer vs to proue our cause
by godly and Lerned witnesses, of what
so euer Age they be, so that he can make
no lawfull Exception against them, then
is he vtterly vndone in his owne Conscience:
knowing that the Catholike
Church, doth expressely and by name,
condemne his Masters Heresies. So
that it is not otherwise likely, but he
will haue vs to stand fast bound to the
first six hundred yeres, and will reserue

vnto himselfe, that special Priuilege, to
Take and Make his vantage, Where,
and When so euer he may.
            
            
               1 That M. Iewel refuseth to

by the Sentence or Testimony of
the first six hundred yeres, to
which only he appealeth.
               WHat Remedie then? If M.
Iewel shall prouoke manfully,
and wretchedly apoint vs
a boūd, which we may not go
beyōd in cōming against him: If he may
vse xv.C. yeres and odd, and we not vi.

lesse vagaries, and we be restrained of
our lawfull libertie: what Remaineth▪
                  
Uerelye to haue pacience, vntill it shall
please Almighty God either to conuer
                     •

                   a better consideration
of these Matters whiche pertaine
to their Saluation, either to come
him selfe in Iudgemente, and make an
ende of all Proceedings. Yet this in
the meane time, thou maist consider (indifferent
Reader) that we are two manner
of wayes abused, by M. Iewell.
               First, that ye wil prescribe vnto vs from
whence we shall take our Argumentes
against him. Secondly, that himselfe

whiche he prescribeth vnto vs.

                     •
                  t all. For now, I shall declare vnto
thee, how Himselfe will not admitte
the Witnesses of the very first six hundred
yeares, vnto whiche he straightly byndeth
vs. And what can bee more vnreasonable?
For in seperating the last
nine Hundred from the first six, and in alowing
the Firste, and condemning the
Latter, what dothe he but note vnto vs

the I
                     •
                  corruption and Puritie of Faith
in those daies, and not warrant the Testimonies
to be good, if it be taken out of
the first six hundred yeres after Christ.
               Of the first he saieth,Iew. 
                        •

be able to bring any one Sufficient Sentence.
&c. that the thinges vpon which
he Chalengeth vs, were vsed or alowed
in the Primitiue Churche, for the space of
six hundred yeres after Christ, I am content
to yeld and subscribe. Of the Later
yeres he saieth.116. 
                  S. Bernard is a Doctour
but of late yeres, therefore his Authoritie
must weigh the Lighter.
               
               If therefore there be no Excellencie or
Prerogatiue in the first six hundred, why
diuided he them, so Precisely and Diligently
from the later nine? And, If
there be so Great, as he seemeth to make,
why will not he himselfe stand vnto the
Iudgment of that Primitiue Churche,
And that first age so chast and vndefiled?
Choose one of these two (M. Iewel,)
which you will: And let vs see an Example
and token, either of your wisdome
and Prudencie, in Separating, for some
iust cause, the Beginninges of the One,

and whole Summe of xv.C. yeres, from
the latter endes of it: either of your Iustice
and Indifferencie, in regarding the
witnesses of the First six hundred yeres,
which you require to be exactly folowed
of others.
               For as you say,Iew. 140. 
                  Lyra and Teutonicus,
liued at the least, Thirtene C. yeares after
Christ: Therefore their Authoritie must
needes seeme the lesse: Whye saye ye not
also, S. Leo, and S. Gregorie, liued fiue
hundred yeares after Christe, Therefore
their Authoritie must nedes seme the lesse?
Or why put you A Difference, betwene
the Former and the later yeres of the xv.
C. in which Christ hath ruled his church?
And, if your wisedome saw good causes,
wherefore you should sort y• yeres which
haue passed sence Christes Incarnation
after a rare maner, & cul out (as it were)
the best from the worst: with what Conscience
then and Equitie, can you refuse
to be ordered by the Testimonie of the
better sort of them?
               
                  For, if against the later nine hundred
yeres which you take from vs, this Exception

of yours is inough to discredite
them,M. Iew. special Exception against the last ix.C. yeres, proueth that he would be ordered by the vi.C. y• went before. that they were Late: It foloweth
consequently, that to the first six hundred
yeres, this alone is Commendacion inough,
that yourselfe make no Exception
against them, but permit vs to take all
the vantage we can out of them. As if
you should haue expressely said vnto vs:
for as much as I will admit no Late Catholike
Doctour, Father, or Councel, but Catholike,
Old and Aunciēt, And, for as much
as I take the last nine hundred and odde
yeres sens Christ, to be but late, and out of
the cumpasse, which I will alow vnto you
in reasoning against me: Therefore, if you
looke, that I shall make no Exception against
the Authoritie and Witnesses which
you will bringe, Prouide by time, that they
be taken out of the vj.C. yeres, next after
Christ.
               This Trueth therefore so standyng,
that, In refusing the witnesses of Later
yeres, you must be vnderstanded to
alow vnto vs the Catholyke wryters
of Auncient time, and this Auncient
tyme, being defined vnto vs by you, y• it

consisteth iust in y• vj.C. next after Christ,
so that if it be founde later but by one
yere, you wil not take it to be old inough:
Let vs see now, in what Maner and Fashion,
you conforme yourself to the iudgment
of that very Time, which you toke
yourselfe vnto, So precisely, as if it
should make altogeather for you.

worthy causes, you make Exceptions against
them, you shall better vnderstand
that by him, whiche alleaged them.
               
               But concerning my Obiectiō, I haue
more plaine and sensible Demonstrations,
to declare, how you refuse Auncient
Fathers, and witnesses, that I nede
not to reason at all with you, about your

Ignominious and Iniurious Extenuations
of the forsaid Authorities. And, if
by these Examples which I shall nowe
bring, it be not made Open and manifest,
that in deede you litle regard Antiquitie,
then will nothing euer make it playne:
And, if this which I shall declare, doe
proue so much to the Indifferēt Reader,
Inough is as Much, as he can require.
               Here then, it would be remembred or
considered, that, which D. Harding bringeth,Hist. Eccl. li. 8. ca. 5.
out of the Ecclesiastical Historie, for
A token and argument of Communion
vnder one kind: The Storie is, of A
noble woman and Heretike, which, being
driuen thereto, by feare of leesing her
husband, promised him to Receiue with
him. And, at the time of the Misteries,
hauyng the Sacrament deliuered into
her handes, she Receiued it not, but toke
of her Maied that stode by, A peece of
Breade, that she had caused to be brought
for the purpose, from her owne house.
Which, as she would haue biten, it hardened
in to a Stone. Hereof D. Harding
gathereth, that.
               
                  
If both kindes had then ben ministred,
Harding. Fol. 45 she would haue practised
some other shift, for the auoiding of
the Cup, which, had not ben so easie.
what sayeth M. Iewel herevnto?
               
               I maie not disgrace the credite of this
Storie,Iew. 136. Flateringly. albeit, in Sozomenus and Nicephorus,
of bothe whome, the same is recorded,
there be sundrie thinges, that may well be
Filed.
               You signifie then,Ra. that you might doe
more, than you will. And, were it not
for A certaine quiet Affection, that is sodainly
come ouer your mind, we see, that,
because Sozonemus and Nicephorus
haue sundrie thinges, that may wel be filed,
Undoubtedly, this Storye should
be one of them, If it were, at this present
your Pleasure. But, because you feare no
Inconuenience, If you should graunt it,
therfore you make no Exception against
it. And yet, least by this letting of the
Storie to passe so quietly, you shoulde
seeme to geaue Occasion to some hereafter,
of taking vantage against you thereby

by: you geaue your Reader a watche
worde, that you doe not alowe the
Storye absolutely, but that you doe not
Disgrace it, And that this selfesame not
Disgracing of it, cummeth rather of
your free will and Humanitie, than of
any bounden Dutie. For, In Sozomenus
and Nicephorus bothe, Sundrye thinges
(you saye) may well be Filed. But
perchaunce ye neede not in this Storye,
to shew how finely you can file it. For
it foloweth.
               But I see no cause yet,Iew. wherfore M. Harding
should blow the Triumph.
               As who should saie:Ra. If there were any
losse cumming vnto you, by this Storie,
then loe, you would File it. But
there is no Feare of any. And why so?
For,
               Why might she not take the Cup,Iew. and
faine that she dranke: and yet, Drinke
nothing.
               Shee might haue done so in deede by
the nature of Absolute Possibilitie,Ra. but
we speake nowe, what is likely to haue
been done, by the course of the Storie.
               
                  
And whereas in bowing downe, after
shee had taken the Sacramente into
her handes, and making resemblaunce to
Praye, shee might haue so handled the
matter, that shee should haue seemed to
haue put somwhat in her mouth. &c. And
yet did not so, but prouided betweene
her selfe and her maide, to bring Breade
from her owne house and to eate that in
steede of the Sacrament: And yet practised
no shift to auoide the Cuppe, It is
very Likelye and Probable, that there
was no receauing of the Cuppe, at that
Present: for which, because there is (as
you wil not deny) a 
                     •
                  leight in a womans
witte, she shoulde haue rather prouided,
as beinge more harde to bringe to
passe.
               For in deede, to put the Cuppe vnto
her mouth, and faine that shee dranke, It
was an Easy matter: And more easy it
was, when shee bowed downe her selfe,
(after the taking of y• Sacrament into her
hands), like one that would praie, to put
her hand only vnto her mouth, And, either
faine that she Receiued, or conueigh
the mater so closely, that it should not be

Perceaued: But, the Circumstance of
the Storie geaneth it, that she coulde not
escape so: (For then vndoubtedly she
had ben a very Naturall, to trouble her
Maied and her selfe, with care, to couueigh
the household breade vnto her, and
care to receiue it. &c.) Ergo, neither
by putting the Cuppe only to her mouth,
(if any then had ben vsed) she could haue
satisfied her husband Or the common expectation
of the lookers on, or her owne
feare.
               Now, whereas no Cuppe was at that
present receiued, she was deliuered of the
care, to find A shift to auoide it, And the
Precise and Singular prouiding to receiue
householde breade, vnder colour of
the Sacrament, proueth, that she was
not trobled with any Feare of receiuing
the Cuppe, or care of auoiding it. And
this Reason or Argument, is problablye
gathered out of the Storie it selfe. But
let vs heare M. Iewels Deuise and Imagination.
               Touching the Trueth of this whole mater,Iew. 13
                        •
                     .
if a man list only to goe by Gheasse, as
M. Harding doeth, why may he not thus

                   Imagine with hymselfe: If this Woman
would thus dissemble in a Case so daungerous,
what needed her to take the Bread at
her Maides handes, And specially at that
 Time, in that Place, And in the sight of the
 whole people? Or, how could she so openly
Receiue it without Suspition? Or
 why might she not haue brought it in A
 napkin, secreetly aboute herself? The burthen
 then was not greate: Her faining and hipocrisie
had ben the easier.
               Thus (sayeth M. Iewel) Why maye
not A man Imagine with himselfe,Ra. if he list.
But, wil ye know why not? I will tell
you. No man ought to make such A
Glose, as shall marre the Texte. Nor Imagine
that, whiche goeth Directlye
againste the Literall Sense of an Historye?
For, the Historye, the credite
whereof you maie not disgrace,
                  Consider M. Iew. listing and imagining against y• Storie. whiche he promised not to disgrace. (you
sayed before) maketh expresse mention,
of breade taken at her Maides handes,
And of the same receyued by the Maestres
in the open Church, And of her
faining and Hypocrisy, how it was confounded.
And this now, is done and
past aboue A thousand yeres sens, And

how it was done it remaineth in wryting.
But you, neuerthelesse, come in
with your Listing and Imagining. Not
to find out that, by probable Conic
                     •
                  tures
which lieth hid in the Storie, but by
cleane Contrarie and froward Fancye,
destroying the very Literall state and
Description thereof.
               And to this effect, as thoughe that the
Sleight of a womans wit were litle worth,
you adde of your owne inuention A further
fetch. Which, perchaunse, the woman
would haue folowed, if she had
knowen it in tyme: but now, after all is
done, to aske, what neede she had to take
the Breade at her maides handes. Or to
wonder, how she could so openly Receiue
it without Suspition. Or to teache her,
that she might haue brought it in a napkin
Or to perswade with her, that the burthen
was not greate, as thoughe the gentelwoman
had bene so tender and fine,
y• she could not haue caried y• weight of
A Singing cake more then her Ordinarie,
Or to Conclude with her,
that her Faining woulde be the Easyer:
                  
thus, I saie when all is past remedie, to
feede your owne Fancie, or fill your Readers
eares, with so long and so vaine A
tale, It is to simple for any womans
wit.
               For Imagine you, as much as ye lift,
that she neded not to take the bread at her
maides handes: The Storie so plainely
testifying, that she toke it, what must folow?
No other thing surely, but that the
Storie is vnlikely.Such is M. Iew. w
                        •
                     en him listeth. And so of euery other
of the Circumstancies, which your man
that hath A list to Imagine, gathereth of
that which hymselfe thinketh meete to
haue ben done, what other thing foloweth,
but that the Storie, which reporteth
the Coutrary to haue ben done, is very
vnlikely and Incredible.
               Such a Fauorer you be of Antiquitie,
and promising at the beginning of your
Answer, not to disgrace the credite of this
Storie, you fall afterwarde, into such A
path of your accustomed Rhetorike, that
by A Figure of listing and Imagining, and
by certaine howes and whyes, ye destroye
A plaine fact and confessed. Who maye
trust you in Obscure or Long maters,

which is an Euident and Short historie,
doe so boldly argue against it? No wonder
if you perswade your Felowes or folowers,
to Discredite Clemens, Abdias,
Hippolitus, Martialis, Athanasius, and all
the whole Boke of Degrees and Decretals,
which haue the Grace and Feate, to
let an Historie stand for true: and yet so
rightly to Gheasse at it, that, If the gesse
be True, the historie must be False.
               The Historie saith, the Gentelwoman
toke the Breade at her maides hand: M.
Iewels, or his Gheasse that (by hys
graunt) lifteth, is, What neede she? how
could she without Suspition? Why might
she not haue brought it in a napkin. &c.
               
               
                  Now whether D. Hardinges Gheasse,
(as M. Iewel termeth it,) concerning
the Receauing in this place vnder one
kind only, be as vnhable to stand wyth
the historie, as the Imaginations which
M. Iewel hath here rekened vp for greater,
than the Sleight of a womans wit did
atteine vnto, let the Indifferent Reader
conferre and iudge. My proper intent
and purpose was, to shew by this Example,
how M. Iewel, can speake, so fauorablie,

of the Auncient Histories of the
first vj.C. yeres, as though he would not
Discredite them: And yet how in deede,
he practiseth with suche Libertie or Licentiousnesse
rather against them, as
thoughe what him listeth to Imagine,
might be better alowed and liked, than
the fact it selfe, which the Historye wytnesseth.
               But let vs trie M. Iewels fidelity, in
an other Example. What say you, to the
Liturgie of S. Iames? I trust you will
not make exception against it, that it was
found very lately in the Ile of Can die, Or,
sought out, and found, and set abroade of
very late yeres, Or, that it is a very little
boke of smal price lateli set abrode in print
about vij. yeres past: (which are so greate
maters in your Iudgment, that for these
causes, you will repell an Authoritye,) I
trust, that you haue no such thing, to laye
against S. Iames Masse. For, by the testimonye
of an auncient Councel, we vnderstand,
that S. Iames wrote a Liturgie
or forme of a Masse. What saye you
then vnto it? It may be doubted of, you
say. And why so? For,
               S. Iames Liturgie hathe a speciall praier

for them that liue in Monasteries. And yet
it was very rathe to haue Monasteries built
in al S. Iames time.
               You meane, I thinke, y• there were no
suche Monasteries then built, as of late
haue ben pulled downe in Englād, large
& fair, & Cōmodious places for holy purposes,
 wt Church, Cloister, Capiter house
Refectory, Dormitorie, Infirmatorie, bisides
Reuenues & lādes for euer, left ther
by Deuout, Noble, and worthy Men &
women, to that end, that God might be
serued of men and women accordingly, &
the religious hauing all things prouided
vnto their hāds, might serue him quietli.
               But, what thē? The forme & accidentes
of an house, do not make a Monastery, no
more then y• maner of aparel doth make a
Monke. And although, in the Apostles
time, no suche peace or glory was in the
church, y• by great buildings or tēporalties,
it was known & estemed in y• world:
yet (without all doubt) the Ordres and
Rules emong some Christians of that
time so rathe (as you call it) were so religious
and well appointed, that S.
Iames might well praye for suche as liued

in a singular manner and fasshion of
a Monasticall and Spirituall life.
               I will not trouble you with many
witnesses in a mater so plaine and euident.

I referre you to Eusebius, and
He wil direct you to Philo Iudeus, which

                     •
                  actized of Christians, before the
name of Christians was well knowen
abroade.
               
                  First, he testifieth of them, that they
renounced all their goods, that they went
out of the Citie, and liued together, lyke
with lyke, in their small grounds and gardens
abroade.
               
                  He declareth also, that they had certaine
speciall houses appointed for Prayer,
which they called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   or 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
               
                  He testifieth of their Excercisies, that
from Morning to Night, they were occupied
in the studieng vpon Scriptures.
               
                  He telleth, howe they leied Chastitie,
and Continencie, as it were a Foundacion
in their Heartes, and that the Women aud
Virgins liued by them selues and the men
by them selues.
               
                  He sheweth, that none of them did eate

or Drinke, before Sunne set, and that they
neither did eate Fleshe nor drinke Wine.
               
                  He Testifieth of their Watchinges all
night long, and fastinges togeather with it,
at some times especially, as at Ester. And,
of their order in Singing of Psalmes.
               
                  To conclude. He sheweth how the priestes
and Ministers did then their Duties,
and how the Bishopes See was aboue All.
               This doth Philo testifie, as done, at
the very beginning, vnder the Apostles,
in whose time himselfe also liued. And
how far is this of, from a Monasticall
life? Yet, saieth M. Iewel.
               It was verye rathe, to haue Monasteries
built in al S. Iames time.
               But was it very rathe, to haue Men
and women liue in A Monasticall kind
of life by Sequestring themselues from
resort, and haunt of Townes, by wilfull
Pouertie, Obedience, Chastitie, and
Spirituall exercisies of Fasting, watching,
and Praying? You here what Philo
testifieth, and howe can you then for
shame either denie it, or doubt of it?
               If therefore there were that so lyued,
they liued in some Places I trowe. In

Caues vnder the ground, or vnder trees,
or vnder Rockes at the least, if you will
alowe them no better rome. And yet, of
their speciall place of Praier, where they
met together, Philo maketh an expresse
mention, calling them 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
monasteries. And who, but wilful & wild
Aduersaries, will thinke, that they liued
here and there, out of order, in the open
Fieldes and Aire, without any defence or
couer, against wind and weather, Or any
distinction and closenesse of dwelling,
which both, are so much desired, and are
so necessary, for the religious in deede?
               Now, if they had places to pray, to cōfer
to Eat, to Slepe, & to do other things in▪
which our Infirmity requireth to be occupied
or susteined by, what let is there,
but y• S. Iames might pray for them that
liued in Monasteries? Or, what Repugnance
or Impossibility is there in y• mater,
that, because such Monasticall houses
were not then builded, as are now extāt,
therefore the Monastical and Religious
persons which then were extant to the
praise of Christianitye, and Glory of our
Sauiour, might not be commended vnto

God in S. Iames Praier?
               But cōsider in this place, how M. Iewel
carieth the Readers mind away, frō
the mater: And turneth it, frō the persons
to the places: from the edifying of soules,
to building of houses: from setting of mē
in an order of perfite life together, to ioyning
of Stones and framing of Timber:
from that which no man will deny, (As,
that in the Primitiue Church, there were
found, which for the loue of God conte
                     ••
                  
                  ning

& cōtemplatiuely) to that which no
man will say (As, that monasteries were
built in the Apostles time) vnderstāding
by Monasteries, such places as cōmonly
now in this Age, goe vnder that name.
               But what should he win by it, so to
chainge frō the persons to y• places? mary
thus much at the least: that, wheras euery
man, without further Examining of the
mater, wil reasonably gather, that the pouerty
and Paucitye, of the Christians in
the Primitiue Church, could not well
stretch to the Building of any such rich &
great houses for the seruice of god, as are
now called, by the name of Monasteries:

it should therfore be suspected, that there
could be no Monkes at al in those daies.
For although wise and Lerned men, may
easely consider it, that the thing it selfe
must go before the name, and the Monke
before the Monastery, and the Substance
before the Accidentes, yet, through the
Desperatenesse of Heretikes, which care
not what they speake or faine against the
Catholike Faithe, the Simple or Common
sort is made to beleue, that the Papistes
doe put so greate A Religion and
Excellencie in externall thinges, that it
must folow, there were no Monkes in
the Apostles time, if it be graunted there
were no Monasteries. And Monastetries,
they can not conceiue, what they
were, or will not beleue that any were,
except we should proue, that they were
of like making with these which they remember,
to haue stoode very faire once,
in England, or yet to stand and remaine
beyond the Seas.
               It was therefore nothing els, but A
very Craftinesse of M. Iewels, to argue
against the Religious, for whome Saint
Iames praieth, because there was no

building of Monasteries, in S. Iames
time. Or, if it was not Craftines, it was
plaine vnsensiblenes.
               For what can he answer? S. Iames Liturgie
(sayeth he) hath an expresse praier
for them that liue in Monasteries. Be it so.
But what call you them in one worde?
for A name, I am sure they haue. Surely
what so euer name you geaue them, your
Argument must be this: there were no
Monasteries built in S. Iames time, Ergo,
there were no 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :
that is to saie, there were no Religious
men, so rathe in the world, neither liuing
alone in solitarines, neither in felowship
with al thinges Common emong thē. &c.
As though S. Ihon the Baptist, or before
him, Helizeus, and Helias, could not
in their life time be Commended vnto
God, in a Speciall Prayer for Monkes,
Heremites, or Religious persons, because
it was very rathe to haue Monasteries
or Religious houses built, so long
before the Gospel of Christ.
               Not to espie therefore, the rudenes of
this Argument, it was very grosse and
vnsensible, and vnlike, perchaunse, to be

found in M. Iewel: But, to remoue the
Intention of the Reader, from the Persons
to their houses: and to draw the question
vnto this Common place, not, whether
Monkes or Religious Persons were
extant in the Apostles time▪
                   But, whether
Monasteries were built so rath, (In which
question, taking the word Monasterie
Grammatically, he should be easely confuted,
but taking it Commonly, as it is
now vsed of the people, he might probably
mainteine his Assertion, and also,
vnder the Ambiguitie of the worde, goe
from one Sense to an other, and make A
shew of a good cause and plentifull, because
in some sense his wordes be true.)
This in deede procedeth of M. Iewels
wit. Of whom that thou maist the better
Beware, Remember how he seemeth to
alowe and esteeme the Testimonies of
the first six hundred yeres, and Consider
vpon how light and vaine Occasions, he
taketh Authority away, from the Liturgie
of S. Iames the Apostle.
               Of the like Reuerence to Antiquitye,
and wisedome in making of Arguments,
that also cummeth, which you gather, against

S. Chrisostomes Masse: saying.
               Chrisostomes Liturgie praieth for pope
Nicolas▪ &c.Iew. 10. And likewise in the same Liturgie,S. Chrisostomes Liturgie denīed.
there is A Praier for the Empire,
and victorie of the Emperour Alexius. &c.
Now it were very much, for M. Harding
to sai, Chrisostome praied for mē by name,
seuen hundred yeares before they were
borne. I trow that were prophesiyng, and
not Praying.
               Your troweing is Reasonable:Ra. And if
S. Chrisostome should be affirmed vnto
me, to haue praied for A Pope and an
Emperour, borne fiue or six hundred
yeres after him, I could not but suspct
the mater.M. Iew. hasty in his iudgement. But will you examine and
consider it no better? Or will you geaue
sentence against a Boke, before you haue
seen the Copy of it?
               Why, you will Answer me, that you
read in the printed Liturgies which are
now extant, and attributed to S. Chrisostome,
the names of Nicolas & Alexius.
Yea but where read you, that S. Chrisostome
vsed those Names, when he came
to his Memento in his Masse? Why
say you, did not he speake euery worde,

as it is now expressed vnto vs in Print,
that he did speake: No forsothe, concerning
the names. For, in setting out the
forme of A Masse, the most of the thinges
that should be folowed, he might so appoint,
that they should neuer neede to be
chainged.All these things are found in S. Chrisostomes Liturg

Of Bringing thither y• bread that should
be consecrated, Of putting wine and water
togeather, Of Praying alowde, Of
Praying Secretly, Of Drawing the curtaines,
Of shewing the Sacrament, Of
receauing the Sacrament and so furth:
the maner (I say) of these thinges, might
so be Inuented or Deliuered at the first,
that they might (if it pleased the Posteritie)
wel continue for euer after.
               But, whereas in certaine places of his
Liturgie, he would haue special mention
made of the holy Sainctes in heauen, or
some singular Persons on earth: could
he put presentli al their names in, whom
he would haue to be remembred in those
places? In deede, that required A gift
of Prophesying, which in this place needed
not. For, in all Formes and Paternes

not only of Publike Seruice, but
also of Common and temporall matters,
(as, the Stiles of Princes, the Tenours
of Indentures and Obligations, The
maner of Inditements. &c.) the rest of
the wordes are expressed, as they shall
continue, only, when the place commeth,
where the Persons name must be specified,
to whom the cause perteineth, there
is no certaine name Defined, but A great
N. set, to keepe the roome, and to signify,
that when you put that forme of write
in Practise, you shall place the partyes
Name, where that letter standeth.
               So was it in S. Chrisostomes Liturgie.
The Forme wherof being wel liked,
and therefore copied out that it mighte
goe abrode and continue, was not chainged
in any point, concerning the maner
of Celebrating and Praying, which presently
then might be defined. But, where
as he maketh, in Distinct places of hys
Masse, speciall mention of the Sainte,
whose feast shall happen to be celebrated
that daie, and of the Patriarche and Emperour,
which should be aliue when hys
Masse would be saied, he could not presently

put in their Names.
               What remained then but that he shuld
put in such a phrase (as 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  )
by which it should be declared, y• what so
euer Sainct, Patriarch or Emperour he
were, there his name shuld be rehersed
where y• 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                  ▪ was found to stand.
               Yet, this notwithstanding who can let,
but he that would, might in copying out
the Liturgie, apply it to his owne time, &
name the Emperour then liuing. But
when y• Emperor shal afterward depart,
his name must be scraped out, to geaue
place to an other, except priestes shuld alwaies
do so much wtout boke, as to pray
for the Emperor y• liueth, though y• name
of the dead Emperor cōtinue in y• Masse
boke. Of the name therfore, of either Patriarche
or Emperour, which is specified
in some Liturgie, no Argument can be
made y• the forme therof was not extant,
before the Persons therin expressed were
borne, but only, that when they liued and
Ruled in those quarters, they were praied
for in the Publike Masse.

any, though speciall Praier be made in
them, both for the Patriarch and Emperour:
Also, by what occasion Nycolas and
Alexius names, came in: Againe, how the
Nycolas, whom you speake of, was not
y• Pope of Rome, which liued 200. yeres
before Alexius, but the Patriarch of Constantinople
which liued at one time with
him: And in conclusion how euidentlye
it may be perceiued, that this Liturgie,
which is said to be Chrysostomes, was
in very deede, that blessed Doctours making,
of all this, Master Pointz in his
Testimonies for the Real Presence,
                  M. Pointz ca, 7.

may he, y• will see, find how absurdly and

me it is inough to declare, that he make
light of the Authors within y• first vj.C

to deny thē. And, y• his reasō, vpon which
he groūdeth his opiniō in refusing some
of thē, is so feble & vain, y•, as it cōfirmeth

y• he hath a very light head of his owne,

and a very Presumptuous mind, which
vpon small Occasion, yea rather against
all Occasion, was so ready to take authoritie
away from that Liturgie, which,
both the Greeke Church vseth, And the
Latin aloweth, for Chrisostomes owne.

               Here, If you like your owne Reason,

glad that you are wiser, than you were
wont to be.
               Yet, I doe not refuse Erasmus, or D.

Learning, and Number of their betters,
and their elders. Those I meane, which
liued and florished A thousand yere together,
before Erasmus was borne, and of
whome, you can find no one, which hath
denied the Dionisius of whom we speake

               But consider you (M. Iewel) in this
place, whether it be not most true in you,
that you seeke alwaies, how to Destroye
or Diminishe all thinges, as much as ye
can? For, if there be no false Doctrine in
these

                  okes, nor any thing contrarye to

your cause, to haue men beleue, that they
be the workes of that Dyonisius, which
was S. Paules scholar? And because you
shall see my meaning in an other Example,
as also haue it noted vnto you, that
Erasmus, whom, in disgracing of S. Denyse,
you bring in, as A graue and lerned
man, is better interteined of you than he
deserueth, I say:

                  s (more bold,Erasmus iustly reprehēded. surely,

to play the Censor, and by once reading
of A Boke ouer, to gather A priuate coū

say) he toke so much vpon him, and exequuted

was embraced as S. Cyprians.
Erasmus yet putteth the mater in
question, and after great argumēts made
Pro et Con, wtin himself, his finall answer
is, that, probabilius videtur non esse Cypriani,
it seemeth more probable that it is
not S. Cyprians.
               
               Wel M. Doctor and Censor, S. Hierome

is witnesse that it is, and vseth A
Chapiter thereof as an Authoritye of S.
Cyprians,Hier. lib. 1. aduers Pelag. wherefore you may perceaue,
that either you haue not seen al thinges,
either haue not remembred them, Or els
that your iudgment is not all of the best.
               But let this passe, that S. Hierome is
directly against you, was there any thing
in the Boke ad Quirinum, hurtful either
to Faith or good Maners? No verely,
you find no such fault in the boke. Why
Disputed you then, whether it were S.
Cyprians or no? And, if for your exercise
sake, you would needes moue the
doubt, you should better haue inuented
an Answer against the Obiection which
did hinder the Estimation of it, than by
needlesse making of it, minister any Occasion
vnto your Reader to set lesse by
such a worke, as by much crediting of
which, he could take no harme.
               For suppose it so, that being not S.
Cyprians in deede, I so loue and Reade
the boke, as if it were his: what daunger
hereby is cumming vnto me: the Boke
being Sound and good, whyche I doe
Reade?
               
                  
But now on the other side, the Boke being
tried to be S. Cypriās, or if it should
not be so tried, yet, in trueth▪ being hys:
yourselfe first, doe hurt your owne Fame
and Estimation, in geauing so rashe A
sentence, And you cause me to haue le
                     •
                  sse
mind vnto a good boke, and to Suspect
that, which should not be distrusted. So
that in letting the titles of Bokes alone,
as we found them, though they shoulde
(by putting the case so) bear false names,
there is no Iniury done or taken, if the
booke be alowable: but in Changing or
Disgracing them, when it needeth not,
(for any harme which is to be feared in
Reading of the boke,) it lacketh not a
peece of vaine Glorie, Or of angry Foly.
               As in our case now (M. Iewel) of the
Boke de Ecelesiastica Hierarchia, you tell vs
that it is Iudged (of such men, as neyther
you nor we, make greate accompt vpon)
that it can not be the boke of Ariopagita,
S. Paules disciple, that is mentioned in the
Actes. But to what end tell you me so?
Is the boke to be Credited or no, tell me
that? Is there any Heresy in it? Is there
any Irreligion? Is there any Folie?
               
                  
Is there any thing that you can contemne?
Or forbid to be readen? I can not

                  e of the
mater which we defend by him?
               Did you thinke (M. Iewel) by wryring
your mind in this fashion, not to
hinder, in any respect, the credite of the
forsaide boke, but only to shew a point of
your knowledge, And how that you wer

And how can you thē excuse yourself,
of blind Foly and Contentiousnesse?
               For, whereas S. Denyse the Ariopagite,
is not he alone, that must be credited,
but euery Auncient writer (whome
you doe alowe for auncient) may well
stād for a witnesse: what wiseman would
euer enterprise, to diminish the Estimation
of A Substantiall witnesse, by casting
in against him (of his owne or other
mennes Suspition,) that in some
Corners he hath an other name, than generally
he is taken by? And, whereas
it helpeth your cause nothing at all,

of the boke de Eccles. Hierarch: so y• you

and of contrarying your aduersary, than
agreeing with Reason: you should allwaies
folowe, the more Peaceable and

your Congregation? Or, if yourselfe
will be more Spirituall and Deiforme,
than to vse External & Sensible meanes,
to conduct you vnto that, which is One,

               If you doe not: how looke you like
one, that would follow Autentike and
Graue Examples, testified by Auncient
and sad writers? And, wherefore doe
you make the world beleue, that you,

good men, would haue all thinges reformed,
according vnto the Paterne of
the Primitiue Church, whose Procedinges
are found to be so contrarie, vnto
the Ecclesiastical Orders of that time?
               Be plaine (M. Iewel) in that which
you intend, and Quod

Occasions to bring them by outward
Signes to Deuotion: nor the dead,
Praiers: And that Sign, which hath ben
vsed in all holy Functions, and which, of
old, they made in the Foreheade, to testify
that they were not ashamed of Christ, the
signe I meane of his CROSSE, which
is not only new A Foly to Panimes, or
Offence to Iewes, but an Ignomynie
to the Gospell, and Apishnes in the Catholikes,

or Painimes doe Blaspheme, thys
Signe of the Crosse (Mayster Iewel)

which thinke it a shame to haue a Token
of our Redemption, before their Eyes:
If you esteeme Antiquitie.
               And if ye regarde it not, why make ye

you haue, either blindely abandoned
them, before you knew them, either desperately
doe contemne them, after ye be
aduertised of them.
               O, say you, He, that wrot those bokes
De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia, was not S.
Denyse the Ariopagite. As who should
say, that if it were he, you woulde in no
wise contrary him. But how shall I
beleeue you? Whereas you pretende,
that you will be content with the Aunciedt
Fathers testimonies, and yet cry out
against that forme of Administringe the

against you, what the name of that
Author was. You cōfesse him to be auncient:
Short and clear. I infer them, that he is worthy of
credite. You wil not be ruled by his Testimonie,
I gather then, that you Regard
not the Auncient. And that I proue by
an other Example. The Supremacie
of the Bishop of Rome, of how greate
force and strength it is, the Catholikes &
Heretikes bothe, doe see. And as we doe
proue it by true Experience, that nothing

is more needfull to be perswaded vnto
such as loue to haue a sure Staye in all
maters of Controuersies: so, our aduersaries
doe set against nothing so Ernestly
and Outragiously, as the Prerogatiue
of that See. Here vpon starteth a Chalenger
vp: Shew me (sayeth he) that the
Pope was euer Called Heade of the
Church. The Catholike Answereth, He
was, in deede, Head of the Church, as appeereth
many waies, though he were not
called in his Ordinarie Stile of writyng,
Head thereof.

that can perswade you to Subscribe.
               
                  Eugenius Bishop of Carthage answered to
Obadus, requiring A Councell to be kept

in Aphrica, wherein, The Arrians might
dispute with the Catholikes, concerning
Religion and Faith: that, he would write
to his brethern, that his felow Bishops
might come. Et precipue, Ecclesia Romana
que Caput est omnium Ecclesiarum, and the
Church of Rome especially, vvhich is the head of
all Churches.
               
               Here now, of this Story and Text,
I gather, that the Bishop of Rome, is
HEAD of all Bishops, & so much ought
the Aduersarye to graunt vnto me, if he
loued not, by force of consequence, to be
driuen vnto the confession of Truth, but,
of his owne accord, to yeld vnto reason.
For, when Eugenius the Bishop answered,
that he would write, that the Church
of Rome (most chiefly,) should come to y•
Coūcel, what meant he thereby? Dyd he
meane that any message should be sent, to
the marble Pillars, Foundations, Row
                  
                     •
                  es,
walles of Stone, or any such vnsensible
thing, perteining to the Materiall
Church of Rome? Truly, then, for hys
wit, who so euer should thinke so, might
be President of that Councell, where
Postes and Pillers should meete togeather,

and heare the cause of our Religion
debated.
               But did he meane by the Church of
Rome al the Christians of Rome? Who
then should keepe the Citie whiles they
were from home? Or how was al Carthage,
able to receiue them? Or what
hath the Laitie to do in Councels? Yf
then, neither the walles &c. of Rome,
neither al the Christen people of it, be
rightly vnderstanded by the Churche of
Rome, which B. Eugenius would haue
to come to the Coūcel at Carthage, what
other thing may be meant thereby?
               You wil say, perhaps, the Clergie
thereof. Whether al, or some? Yf al,
do you thinke Eugenius to be so simple
as to require, that al Priestes, Deaco
                     •
                  s,
Subdeacōs, Lectours, Exorcistes, Sextines,
Clerkes, belringers, and Quieresters,
might come to the Councel?
               Yf some: what should they be? Exempted
from the Iurisdictiō and Gouernement
of the Pope, Or subiect vnto him?
Yf Exempted: who should they be in al
Rome, with whom the B. of Rome,
should haue nothing to do? If subiect:

how could they come without his leaue
and licence? Or how should not he that
sendeth them, be much more higher and
worthier, then those which must aske
leaue to goe?
               What so euer you Answere, If the
Church of Rome be heade of al Churches, because
of some parte of the Clergie therof:
must it not much more be heade of al Churches
because of the Bishop there, which
is head ouer that Clergie?
               For, if the lesser thing, be in Estimation
and Authoritie, much more the
greater in the same kinde must be in Authoritie.
As, if an Angel naturally doth
passe in degree of worthines, euery man,
much more he▪ that by the giftes of nature
doth excel among Angels, must consequently
be farre aboue man.
               We neede no
                     •
                   vse so many wordes,
in opening this Argument, if we had to
do with Quiet and Reasonable men: but
M. Iewel wil needes be Ignorant, or
Contentious. For (saith he) Uictor
which reporteth the forsaid Aunswere of
Eugenius the Bishope,Iew. 310. 
                  Doth not cal the
Bishop of Rome the Head of the vniuersal

Church, only he saith, Rome is the Chiefe,
or Head Church of al other.
               
               No, he saith not Rome, but y• 
                  Churche
of Rome. And if you wil defend your self,
that by Rome the Church of Rome is meant
in common speache, I pray you Syr, can
you not also remember, that in naming
the Church of Rome, the Bishop of Rome is vnderstanded
to be spoken of? And, if in
other places it might be somtimes otherwise,
yet in this testimonie of Uictor, it
can not but be meant of the Bishoppe of
Rome especially.
               For consider, I pray thee (Indifferent
Reader) the Circumstancies of the
Storie.
               Obadus the Capitaine required a
Coūcel to be kept in Aphrica. In which,
it is for Bishoppes, not onely to sitte,
when it is called, but first to determine
whether it shalbe called or no.
               He required it also, of the Bishope
Eugenius. For although Huneryke his
Maister, King of the Uandales was in
those partes a Cōqueror, yet there were
not at that time such Flatterers or Gospellers
as might tel his Grace, that him

selfe was Supreame head of the Church,
a
                     •
                  d that he needed not to care, what the
Popishe Bishopes would thinke in any
mater.
               Thirdly Eugenius answered, that 
                     •
                  e
would write to his Bretherne, that his
felowbishopes might come. By which it
is cleare, that he wisshed, not, either
for the material Church of beyonde the
seas, or al the Ministers and officers of
those Churches, but only for Bishopes.
               Fynally and Chiefly, he would write
(he answered) that the Church of Rome the
head Church of al Churches, might come.
And howe can this otherwyse be vnderstanded,
but according to y• nature of the
Mater, and Persons which he spake of
before? For, whereas A Councel requireth
Bishopes to be present, And
hymselfe expressly declareth it, that he
would haue his Felowbishopes come:
In saying, immediatly after, that aboue
all other he would the Churche of Rome
to come, he must so take these wordes, the
Churche of Rome▪
                   as they maie serue for A
Councel, and for the meeting together of
Catholike Bishoppes. But to suche A

purpose, it was neither possible, to
bring the externall Churche of Tymber
and Stone, neither was it conuenient,
profitable, or customable, to haue y• whole
Clergie of euery countrie, to be present
at Councels: Ergo he meant it of the
Bishoppe of Rome, hymselfe.
               Then whereas he would, the Church
of Rome most Chiefely to come, because
it is heade of all Churches, he signifieth
thereby, that his mynde and desire was,
to haue other Churches to come also.
For els he would haue saied, I
beseech the Churche of Rome, only to
come, and not Chiefely. Because the word
(Chiefely) hath A Relation to other
that should come also, though not so
principally and agreablie to his intent
and purpose.
               Nowe in expressing this his mynde,
that he would haue other Churches, of
beyonde the Seas, to come, what words
vseth he? Doth he not cal straitewaies
for his Felowbyshopes? And in respecte
of them, doth he not require, that
most Chiefely the Church of Rome should come?
                  
And what other sense can that haue, by
any reasō, but that the Bishop of Rome
should come? For, if he had said thus,
I vvil vyrite to my Brethren, that the Churches
of beyond the Seas may come, and most chiefly
to the Church of Rome▪
                   then had the sētence
gone forwarde in like termes. And in
this case, who but Rude and Ignorant,
would deny, that by Churches he
meaneth the Bishops them selues, Or
by theyr appointment some to represent
or fil their place? But he changed the
Termes, and in one parte speaking of
Bishops, in the other he nameth not the
Bishope, but the Church of Rome.
               
               Yet what of this? Shal this changing
of Termes alter his meaning?
               A
                     •
                  d wishing in the former parte of his
sentence, that Bishoppes should come,
but especially the Churche of Rome, what
can he rightly meane by the church of Rome
but the Bishoppe of Rome, yf one part
of the sentence hangeth with the other?
For this were al together out of reason,
that, naming first Bishops, and then a
thing more requisite in the same kinde of
purpose, then Bishops: he should meane

by that thing which he preferreth, a lesse
in effect and Authoritie, then they were
whom he had lesse compted vpon.
               This place then making so plainly,
for the Authoritie of y• Bishop or Church
of Rome (for al is in effect one, to them
that vnderstand the common phrases of
Speach) what wil M. Iewel do? Subscribe
to antiquitie, Or maintain stil his
Heresie? No, he loueth him selfe, and
his owne vaine glory so much, that rather
then he wil seme to take a foyle, and
to haue spoken more, then he is hable to
assure, he wil not lacke his Exceptions,
against the witnesses of the First six hundred
yeares. For thus he openeth him
selfe more and more,Iew. 310. saying:

And this also is against sincere and honest
dealing, to promise or rather protest
that you would be tried by any Doctor,
Father, Councel, or Example of the
Primitiue Churche: and now so desperately
to come in with this exceptiō, that
Uictor is no Scripture. It foloweth.
               
                  
Nor Councel.Iewel.
               
               Remember your selfe M. Iewel.
There are, emong your Fauorers, some
discrete, Sadde, and Iust men. Whome,
your Inuention in this place, wil litle
please. And your much seeking to extenuate
Uictors Authoritie, wil be an
Argument vnto them, that you fall to
Copie of wordes, and shiftes of Rhetorike
(meete for Childerne) when Copie of
Sense▪ and certaintie of good Answer,
doth not serue your greate Stomacke.
               You saied wel once,151. 
                  that one good sentence
were Proufe sufficient, and are you
so much chainged, so sodainely, that you
dare set light by an Auncient and graue
wytnesse, because he is no Councel? You
neede surely some good counsel, least by
extreme folowing with al your wit, the
defense of your mad Challēge, you chaūce
to fall bysides your wittes, and haue no
sense at al of your doinges. It foloweth.
               Nor Doctour.Iewel.
               
               Now define you then, A Doctour?
For in deede, whome you wil alowe to
beare that name, I can not tel. And, such
Libertie you haue takē now vnto your

self, of binding vs to your meaning, that
if you wil vnderstand by a Doctour none
other, but either S. Ambrose, S. Hierome,
S. Augustine, or S. Gregorie,
which are called the foure Doctours of
the Church, Or some such, as hath been
solemly Created and made Doctour in
some Uniuersitie: we must be conten
                     •
                  
with your sense, and let you haue your
owne minde and meaning.
               But if you wil be ordered by reason,
you wil not deny (I suppose) that Uictor
might wel be A Doctour, which being
a Bishop of no smal Citie in Aphrica,
had by al likelyhoode the knowledge
of Scriptures, and grace of expounding
them, and diligence in executing his office.
Except that M. Iewel wil be so
Iniurious to the first six hundred yeares
after Christ, in which Uictor liued, that
he wil Iudge any one to haue ben made
Bishoppe in those daies, which was vnworthy
to be a Doctour.
               Againe if he were no Doctour, was
he therfore no Father? And your self promising,
to admit any sufficient testimonie

of any Father, how wisely make ye now,
an Exception against Uictor▪ because he
was no Doctor. It foloweth.
               Nor writeth the Order or Practise of
the Primitiue Church.Iewel.
               
               O worthy Exception. Doth S.
Augustine in his bookes of Confession,

Church? Nothing lesse. For al

               What new found reason then, is this
of M. Iewels, to contemne an Aunciēt
writer, if he write not of those Maters,
and write also, in such Order, of them, as
he requireth?
               
                  
When we alleage Clemens, de Constitutionibus
Apostolicis, S. Denyse de Coelesti & Ecclesiastica

the Decrees and Decretales: straitwaies you
either deny them, either suspect them, either
wil fyle them better, before you beleue
them. Yet, there are not, in whom
you may see more expressely, the printes

those times, and in Decrees, Answeres,

of them was vsed?
               You therefore which, so litle set by
those writers, by whom we may vnderstand
most plainly, what the particulars
were, of the cause and state of our Religion
in the Primitiue Churche: now
when Uictor is brought against you, sodainly
you be so chaunged, as though it
might be an exception against a witnes,
that he writeth not the Order or Practise

               And yet, this Exception of yours,

commeth not so luckely against Uictor.

state the Church was in, vnder the Uandales,
he describeth sufficiently. And
by his telling this much we vnderstande
of the Order and Practise, (yf not of the
Primitiue Church, yet) of that Church,
which was within the six hundred yeres

at this present, that they be translated into

mistrusted, or called without cause into
question. He wrote also vnto Hunericus
King of Uandales an accōpt of his faith

being driuen thereto by the Cōmaundement
of y• King. By which you may perceiue
that great accōpt was made of him.
               Concerning then his age, he liued
not long after the time of S. Augustine:
farre within the First six hundred
yeares, out of which, any Testimonie is
sufficient against you. For when the
Uandales were in Aphrica, and were
busy in furthering the Procedinges of
the Arrians, then liued Uictor, as may
appeere by his Answer to Hunericus, &
by diuerse places of his historie, in which
he speaketh of him selfe as one present at
y• doing of things. For in this very place
which is alleged ou

                   of him for y• Supremacie
of the Church of Rome, he saith,
that when Hunericus had required by
his Edict and Commaundement, that
the Catholike Bishops, should by a day,
meete at Carthage, there to haue theyr
faith examined and tried:
               Cognoscentibus igitur qui aderamus simul,

which Uictor liued.
               
               But these thinges you say, are not
wel knowen. If they be knowen, it is
inough: As for the wel knowing of them
you are either so suspitious or malicious
y• (I feare) it wil neuer be wel knowen,
y• which commeth directly against your
Procedinges. For how easy a mater
is it to deny, and doubt, and obiect, and
finde faulte, and make somwhat alwaies

               You finde the Boke extant, and that

                  dgement, doth
worthely esteeme, and whom yourselfe

dare not dishonour but couertly. Wherefore,
that this fowle Sprite of Contempt
of Old Fathers whiche lurketh in the
breast of M. Iewel, may be the better examined
and espied what it is, whiles it
waggeth now his tongue: we shal not
neede to haue an Exorcist for the mater,
but any reasonable and Indifferēt man,
shal be hable, to conuince hym, by these
short questions.
               For first of al, how know you (
                     •
                  .
Iewel) that it was fondly done of S. Benet
to cause the Sacrament to be laied vpon a
dead mans breast?
                  S. benet defended. Dyd S. Benet hymselfe,
thinke it to be fondly done? Then
would neither he euer haue do
                     •
                  e it, or
they whiche sought Remedie of hym against
yt terrible chaunce, you may be assured,
nor they so willingly haue obeyed.
               Dyd S. Gregorie find any such fault in
it? He would neuer haue rehersed it then,
to y• disgracing of hym, whom he intended
to honor. And bysides this, the Epiphone
                        •••
                     
                  
or sententious conclusion whiche he inferreth
immediatly vppon the forsayed
example or fac
                     •
                  , doth proue that he highly
estemed it. For, vnto Peter his

Deacon, with whom he talketh in those
Dialogues:
               Perpendis Petre &c. Thou seest Peter (saieth
he) Vvhat merite and vvorthines, this man vvas

                     •
                  , before Iesus Christ our Lord, that the earth
dyd cast furth his bodie, vvhich had not the Fauor
and blessing of S. Benet.
               Dyd God hymselfe mislyke with
it? The euent doth proue otherwyse.
For, as the castinge vp of the Childes
bodye againe and againe, after it was
buried, doth signifie that al was not wel
about it, where such extraordnarie effect
folowed: so the resting of it in the earth
after the body of our Lord was put vpon
it, doth declare that he was now pleased,
which before was offended. If then none
of al these can be perceaued to haue mislyked
S. Benets precept or Counsel: by
what Authoritie sai
                     •
                  th M. Iewel, it was
fondly done by him?
               
               Againe, what thinketh M. Iewel of
S. Benet? It seemeth▪ that he contemneth
hym not vtterly, because of the (S.)
which he putteth before his name. Except
he would haue it vnderstanded, that
the (S.) in this place must goe not for

then, that his do

                  inges are to be
Iudged of, with Reuerence. Furth then
to S. Gregorie.
               What opinion hath M. Iewel of him?
I should thinke very good. For he was
an holy and lerned Father, and lyued also
within the first six hundred yeares.
And (which is more worth than al this)
A Late writer in deede, but as he would
be thought, a greate Frind and Patrone
of Antiquitie, One M. Iewel hath these
wordes of hym:
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   
                  Verely S. Gregories Authoritie
in this case were very good, if he
would saie the worde. If therefore, so
gr
                     •
                  ate Authoritie make for this fact of
whiche we speake, and if the spirite of
God were in those two Fathers S. Benet
and S. Gregorie: what knowledge
is that in M. Iewell, by whiche he is
hable to saie, It was but fondly done by
S. Benet, &c?
               
               If y• like case should happen vnto him,
that any of his brethernes bodyes in

the Congregation of Sarum, should be
cast vp againe after it were once buryed,
what would his polytike wisedome doe?
Commaunde it he would perchaunse, to
be buryed again
                     •
                  . So might he in dede.
               But if it were cast vp againe after the
second buri
                     •
                  ing, and if further yet, as oft
as it should be put vnder the earth ouer
night, it were found vpon the ground in
the mornyng: what then would his holynes
or wisedome doe? Would he byd
the Brothers or Systers, cast that (with
al care after it) out of the waie, and suffer
that to rotte aboue ground, which wyll
not lie stil vnder ground, when it was
wel inough buried? For his wysedome
and deuotion he might do it wel inough.
               But if God, which suffered the forsaied
castinges vp againe, of the deade
bodie, to signifie thereby a displeasure
iustly co
                     •
                  ceiued, if he now would by other
waies declare the same, euen vpon
this bodie which M. Iewel should leaue
vnburied, were he hable to abyde the

                     •
                  error of it? And would he not seeke for
some Remedie against an extraordinarie
and straunge effect of Gods indignation?
               
                  
And what remedie would that be?
I can not tel verely, there is so litle power
or none rather at al, in any thinge
that they can doe. Yet (for example
sake) if it were put in his minde to make
a Crosse vpon the breast of the deade body,
or to put a Relique of some holy man
vpon it, Or the Gospel of S. Iohn, Or
a peece of holy breade, Or (if these things
would not like him) if he should venter
to put vpon it a leafe of Caluines Institutions,
Or of the Communion bookes,
Or a peece of Latimers staffe, Or Cranmers
gowne, or Hoopers bones, Or any
other thing that he estemeth: If that after
any of these thinges were put on the
Body, it should be quiet & lie stil where
it were cast or buried: were it a likely
mater that it should be fondely done, to
haue applied that to the deade Bodie, of
which a merueilouse and comfortable
effect should be seen to folow?
               Surely, if by your Cōmunion booke,
or any bone of your false Martyrs, a Miracle
should seme to be wrought, I wold
neuer thinke, that you did fondly to vse
the meanes of those things that are pretious

emonge you, to the bringing of
some purposes to passe: but this I would
certainely Iudge, that your selues are
very fond men to esteeme those thinges
that you doe, and that the Diuel had power
to illude you. Now if you dare
saie, that S. Benet did not wel, to haue
so excellent and great opinion of the Sacrament
as he had, Or that it was the
worke of the diuel of hel and not of God,
that the Monkes bodie remained vnder
the earth, after the Bodie of Christe
was laied vpon it: then loe, I perceiue
that you haue spoken very fauorablie of
S. Benet in saying, that it was but fondly
done by him, and that in deede, you
Iudge it to haue been wickedly and
shamefully done of him. And you must
iudge, not of him onely, so, but of Constantius,
Ualentinianus, Simplicius (S.
Benets successours) And of S. Gregorie

Catholike Father within those yeares.

For what would not he not doe, if feare
of the Magistrates 
                     〈◊〉
                   shame of the
worlde (as yet) did not let him, which
is so folishe harby, as to put in one case
or degree the tales of Heathen Poetes, &
the Recordes of Christian Historiographers:
the Fancies of Idle men, and the
Dispensatiōs of almighty God: the Cō

that procure deuotion? He bringeth
it in, by occasion of S. Basils vision
which Amphilochius speaketh of: and
so much the more vttereth his cankred
Stomake, by how much he had the lesse
occasion to folow it. His woordes be
these.
               We may now the better beleue that Iupiter
with his Goddes went downe sometimes
for his pleasure to banket in Aethiopia,

                      thee. Or that an Angel euermore ministred
the Sacramente vnto Marcus that Holy
Monke: Or. &c.
               As who should say, the one is as likely
as the other, Or, the one as vaine as
y• other. But what man of honesty would
euer say so? Yf some brutishe and vnsensible
Heretike should plainely, at the beginning,

protest, that he would no better
esteeme what so euer Fathers Testimonie▪
than Christian men doe regarde
Homers Poetrie, although for his blūtnes
he might be condemned, yet for his
plainesse he should not be blamed. Mary
if an other man, who knoweth the price
of sundry bookes though thei be not scripture,
and most distinctly signifieth it,
that he wil admit any Catholike writer,
of the first six hundred after Christe, if he
sodainly wil liken any Auncient writers
narration, to Homer the Father of
al Poetes Imagination, he shameth vtterly
his owne studie, doinges, promise,
and honestie.
               Are the comming of Iuppiter downe
to a banket in Aethiopia, and the Angels
comming to Marcus an holy Monke to
geaue him the Sacrament, are these two
so like, that M. Iewel could thinke it
reasonable, to put them in one sentence,
and in one kinde of case togeather? As
for Iuppiters Godhead and his banketting
in Aethiopia, not onely al Christians
doe take for a wretched and vaine fable,
but the Painimes also themselues, such

as were of the more learned sorte,Aug. de ciui. Dei. lib. did
neuer so accompt of him: as in outward
wordes they seemed to doe.4▪ cap. 27. & 
                        〈◊〉
                     . But Marcus
the Monkes holines, and the Seruice
that the Angel did vnder God, vnto
him, none surely but Infidels wil
iudge to be fained. For to a good and
faithful minde, what is there in this storie
that doth sound absurde

                  y?
               To haue a Monke holy, should that
seeme incredible? He doth very il him
selfe when he is alone, that Iudgeth so
wickedly of the Solitarie lyfe. And
this Reproche or Scla
                     •

               But is it like to be fained, when
the Sacrament is saied to be geauen vnto
some persons by the ministerie of an
Angel? what shal we thinke then,
                     
                        〈…〉

the Angel that caried the Prophete Abacu
                     •
                  
by an heare of his heade, from Iudea
to Babylon? Or, of the Angel Raphael
that went like a goodly yong man,

with Tobie the yonger, and did eate
drinke, talke, make mery with him, and
instructed him in al thinges, in like maner
as deere and hartie friendes and felowes
behaue them selues towards their
friendes and companions? Uerely,
whereas almightie God him selfe hath
so debased him selfe, that he is become
man, and geaueth him selfe wholy vnto
man, to be eaten of him, that man might
be vnited vnto God and liue by his life:
it were no wonder at al, in cōparison, if
y• Diuine foode should be alwaies ministred
to man, by the visible seruice of Angels.
For neither can the Angels disdaine
at it, to serue that Creature, the
nature of whiche he seeth to be exalted
aboue al Principates, Potestates,
Dominations, Cherubines, and S

               Wherefore then, doth M. Iewel
ioyne so wickedly togeather: An Angel
ministring the Sacramente, and Iuppiter
going to banket in Aethiopia?

within the first six hundred yeres, he
was A Christian, he wrote an Ecclesiastical
Historie, and not Poetical Fables,
his writinges are allowed and receiued,

ministring the Sacrament to Marcus

Testimonie of Macarins an Auncient
and Famous Priest. Which not onely
said it, but for the Truth and certaintie
thereof assured it, that at the time of receiuing,
an Angel did alwaies geue marcus
the Sacrament, and not he. And
that he saw alwayes an hand only, as far
as vnto the wreast of it, at which Marcus
tooke the Sacrament. In testimonie
vndoubtedly of the clea

                  rueilous
expert in the Scriptures, and Gentle,
and Chaste, and Deuoute, and at that
present, one of the most notable in al the
worlde.
               What findeth M. Iewel in this story,

that he maie contemne? Or why refuseth
he the iudgement of Sozomenus and of
Macarius? Of whom, the one reporteth
it, the other confirmeth it: And the one
in reporting it, signifieth it to be credible,
the other in seeing it, assureth it to be notable.
               If it were altogether fayned in deede,
and if other yet should be perswaded to
accept it as Trueth, what harme could
come to them by it? For al, that maie be
gathered thereof, is, that Marcus was
a merueylous holy, and angelical man.
And that God euen in this world, doth
excedingly comfort his seruants by more
waies than one: And th
                     •
                  t the Seruice

                  es of
our wretched lyfe did not let it, we should
find the Angels more present and comfortable,
then they are perceiued to be. And
is there any harme in this, to iudge wel,
of man, Angel, and God? If M. Iewel
can find no greater faultes or hinderancies
to good lyfe and true Faith, in the
going of Iuppiter to bankette with his
yonger Goddes in Aethiopia, I would

which Homers Goddes and
Goddesses had with such as they fauored?
               Nothing is so easie as to cal thinges

into doubt, & to disgrace a true and holy
Storie, by obiecting a lyke vnto it, of the
telling of Idolatours, or the making of
Poetes. In which kind of Confounding,
Marring, and Spoyling of thinges, M.
Iewel hath a Folissh Grace: and if he had
any Reuerence to Old and Approued
Stories, he woulde neuer haue ioyned
Sozome
                     •
                  us, and Homer together.
               He therefore that hath Faith, let hym
thanke God for it, and praie for the increase:
he that hath none, but is negligente
or Indifferent, let hym thinke aduysedly
vpon the sauing, of both soule
and bodye, and make speede to beleue
the Scriptures themselues, whiles
so litle contradiction is, against them.
For other writers then afterwardes, let
hym consider, whether it will stand with
saluation to beleue none, or whether it be
of necessitie, to admi
                     •
                   al: Or whether it
can agree with any reason and constancie,
to contemne them, whome he hath,
for good cause, once alowed.
               In beleuing nothing but Scripture
there is present daunger. For by that
Reason, Scripture it selfe can not be

                  
                     •
                  redited, because it is not writen in all
Scripture.
               In beleeuinge euery thing there is
absurditie, because of so many Contradictions
and Contrarieties as are found
emong Writers.
               In beleuing of certaine bookes not
yet as Scripture, but as the bookes of
Lerned, Auncient, and Generally receiued
Authors, and sayinges as worthie to
be credited and esteemed as our owne
opinions, there is wisedome and discretion.
               But▪ if (as M. Iewel hath geauen
most shameful Examples) any man wil
contemne the selfesame, whome he would
seeme to allowe, that is such a point, not
only of Hypocrisie, but of Iniurie also,
that, as he should BEWARE
OF M. IEWEL for it, so should

                     •
                  e take heed to hym selfe
least he fal in it.
            
            
               
               How M. Iewel vseth the selfesame
testimonies, of the first six hundred
yeares, against whiche he
bringeth Exceptions, when his
Aduersarie allegeth them.
               THus far then we are come against
M. Iewel, y• I haue proued him,
to 
                     •
                  ind y• Catholikes vnto y• first
six hundred yeres, bysides al reason
and equitie, And that hymselfe alleageth
Authorities of later yeres, with all
holdnes and libertie: Thirdly, that he
wil not stand, to the witnesses of the first
six hundred yeres, vnto which he appealed
so precisely.

                  d what is there now, that maie

he maie or hath add

                  d therunto, to would
be considered. And I find that his noble
Courage and tried Magnanimitie is so
greate, that, the selfe same Authorities,
against which he fought too the and naile,
in the Chappiter before, he hymselfe, in
his owne proper person, aloweth in
other places of his Replie, and vseth for
substantial and good Argumentes.
               This, to proue at large, were very
easie, but in recompense of the last Chappiter
before, which hath been longer than
my opinion, I wil make this presēt one,
shorter than my first determination. And
shortnes also maie wel be taken whē the
mater is in sight that is to be proued. I
saie therefore.
               Against S. Chrysostomes Masse,
M. Iewel doth argue in the 10. page of
his Replie, And not only reasoneth simplie,
that it can no

is deceaued in his A
                     •
                  gument, and how

litle cause he hath to dalie as though he
had the victorie, it is sufficiently declared
alreadie fo. 53. of this booke.
               The same M. Iewel in the 89. and
90. page of the Repli
                     •
                   where the place of
S. Chrysostome (There is none to Communicate)
is layed against hym, there, I
saie, he vseth the testimonie of this Liturgie,
& con
                     •
                  esseth it to be S. Chrysostomes.
For these be his wordes.
               Chrysostome himselfe in his Liturgie
saith thus.Iew. 89. 
                  Againe. But what needeth much
proufe, in a Case that is so plaine? Chrysostome
hymselfe in his Liturgie that Commonly
beareth his name,90. foloweth the same
order. Againe, This was the order of S.
Chrysostomes Masse, touching the Clergie,
and that by the wytnesse of S. Chrystostom
himselfe.
               Note the wordes (Indifferent Reader)
and see what proportion is in M.
Iewels doeings.R
                        •
                     . That Liturgie, which,
before, could not be S. Chrysostomes,
because it praieth for Pope Nicolas: and
because,Iew.

                     . 10

                      praieing, that Chrysostome praied for

men by name, seuen hundred yeres before
they were borne: that same nowe is S.
Chrysostomes, by M. Iewels owne
confession. And not only S. Chrysostomes,
but Chrysostomes hymselfe.
               
               For herein also is a greate strength:
that y• place, which was obie
                     •
                  ted against
hym, beinge taken out of S. Chrysostome,
he thought to adde a Grace vnto
his Answere by continuinge in the testimonies
of the selfe same Doctour, and
by making S. Chrysostome to agree
with S. Chrysostom. And so he repeateth
oftentyme.Chrysostoms Liturgie confessed by M. Iew. 
                  Chrysostome hymselfe,
sayinge: Chrysostome HYMSELFE
in his Liturgie. Chrysostom HIMSELFE
in his Liturgie. Chrysostom HIMSELF
in the Liturgie. The very order of Chrysostomes
Masse, by the witnesse of Chrysostome
HYMSELFE. As though
that nothing were so much to be feared,
as that some lyke hymself, would deme
it to be S. Chrysostomes Liturgie, and
then should he leese a good Argument.
Therefore he setteth the Booke furth
very wel, and nameth it the Liturgie
of Chrysostome hymselfe, and maketh
so muche of it, that he signifieth it, to
haue in it self Authoritie inough to proue

an assertion, without any more wordes.
For thus saith M. Iewel.
               But what needeth much proufe,Iew. in a
case that is so plain? Chrysostome himself.
&c.
               As if he should saie:
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   That the Clergie

what needeth much proufe in a case that is
so plained? I could allege more witnesses,
Antiquitie is ful of Examples, The case
is cleare and

wil bring one Testimone for al.

him selfe▪
                   Where I pray you?
In the Liturgie. Why did Chrysostome
euer make any? Where should one find
it? By what note might one know it?

in the Liturgie that cōmonly beareth his
name &c, you might haue ben thought to
haue called it S. Chrysostomes Liturgie,
because other so name it, and no certaintie

                     〈◊〉
                   now
in saying Chrysostom him self &c, you declare
by y• addition of the Pronoune him

                  thor
of this Liturgie. If therefore you cast not
in these wordes that cōmonly beareth his
name, to the dispraise or discredite of the
Liturgie, then haue you not only confessed,
that Chrysostome him selfe should be
maker of it, but farder also, you teach vs
to find out that Liturgie by the title of y•
booke and name of s. Chrysostom, which
it commonly beareth, either you make A
good Argumēt against singular and precise
Heretiques, which wil needes haue
thinges otherwise to be taken, then commonly
they are called.
               
                  
Now, if you dyd put in, the forsaied
words (that commonly beareth his name)
neither to the praise nor dispraise of the
Liturgie, but as it came to your mynde
so you lette it fall out into the Paper,
that which might wel inough haue ben
spared: let so take it then. And what remaineth,
but that Chrysostome himselfe
muste be 
                     〈◊〉
                   vndoubted Author of this
Liturgie, by your conclusion? Otherwise
you haue not proued by Chrysostom
himself, that the Priestes and Deacons
(whiche no man denieth) receiued with
the Bishop or Chiefe Exequutor at the
Aultare, if the Liturgie, by which you
proue it, be not S. Chrysostomes owne.
               Ergo, say I now, whereas M. Iewel
in the 10. page of his Replie, disproueth
the Liturgie of S. Chrysostome:
And, in the 89. and 90. of the same Replie,
affirmeth S. Chrysostome hymselfe,
to saie that, whiche in the Liturgie is affirmed:
It is most plaine and euident,
that the selfesame Authorities of the first
six hundred yeres, which he wil destroie
and denie rather, than his Aduersarie
should vse them, he yet hymselfe will

occupie at his pleasure, and make a great
shew and countenance, that he is a folower
of Antiquitie.
               In like maner in the. 66. page of
his Replie, he argueth against a Decree
of Soter Bishop of Rome, and in the. 76
page folowing, he applieth the selfe same
Decree to his purpose. Read and consider
y• places them selues, you to whom
M. Iewels sayinges are pretious, I
wil note only the brief some of the whole
mater.
               Soter Bishope of Rome (saith D.
Harding) made this statute or decree,Hard. De Consdist. 1. ca
                        •
                      Hoc quoque.
That no Priest should presume to
celebrate the solemnitie of the Masse,
except there were two present and
answere him, so as he himselfe be the
third. For whereas he saith, Dominus
vobiscum, Our Lord be vvith you, and likewise
in the Secretes, orate prome, Pray
forme: it semeth euidently cōuenient,
that answere be made to his Salutation
accordingly.
               
                  
Now of this Decree he gathereth,
that a

                  t the Seruice, and much more,

                   as to celebrate, if the
general & necessarie practise of that time,

                  e said at al. This Decree therefore,
which so euidently destroyeth the
position of M. Iewel, see how he laboreth
to disgrace.
               First he setteth men togeather by the

                     y Pope Anacletus. Some
others saie by Soter. And so whiles some
say one thing some an other, be thinketh
that the quiet Reader which loueth concord
and peace▪ wil folow his resolution,
which is to follow none of the both, but

                     〈…〉
                   an opinion of his owne, that it is

After this he falleth into a common
place, that It was euermore the common

by the names of such, as thei knew to be in

So that y• Cōclusion is brought to an If.
               
               
                  Thirdly,Soters Decree refused by M. Iew. Dist. 19. he speaketh I

                     , that thei haue been doubted of

                  thoritie be not greate, that
thei can not possiblie be theirs, whose names
thei beare.
               
                  Fourthly, he confirmeth D. Smithes
sayinges by certaine reasons not of D.
Smiths, but of his owne: as, These Decretal 
Epistles, manifestlie depraue and abuse
the Scriptures. Thei ma
                     •
                  ntaine nothing 
so much as the kingdom of the Pope.
Thei publish a multitude of vaine and superstitious 
Ceremonies. Thei proclaime.
                  
such thinges as M. Harding knoweth to be
open and knowen lyes, & this later pointe
is proued by certaine coniectures.
               
               But al this hitherto, is nothing to
the disprouing of the foresaid Decree, either
that it is not Soters, either that it
is not to be credited, if as others say, it
were Anacletus. He busieth him selfe
in general and Indefinite propositions,
to no purpose, or cōclusion, but to breed
Suspitions and Doubtes. Much like
as if in reasoning against some heretike,
I would not, nor could not proue that
he were a Diuel, but yet would tel a
long tale and proue it very substantially,
that the Diuel hath oftentimes gone abroad
and ben conuersant with men, and
spoken very manerly of Religion, so like
an honest and true man, as any may seme
to be in al the worlde.
               Fifthly then, after all Preludes or
Preambles ended, he toucheth specially
the decree it selfe, vpon which the Argument
of D. Hardings was groūded. And
his reasons against it, are shortly these.
S. Austin, & 
                     •
                  . Hierō who liued. 250. yeres
after Soter, Haue recorded that the people

of Rome vsed to take the Communion
togeather euerie daie, ergo that practise
wil hardly stand with Soters decree. As
who should saie, that al the people might
not receaue at ou
                     •
                   priestes handes if any
other priest, when they were departed,
should goe to the Aultare, and haue no
moe but two to answere hym.
               Item, this word, Sole
                        •••
                      seemeth to
importe a solemne companie or resorte of
people. Yea but Missarum solennia doth
import, not by seeming, but by plaine
construing, neither cumpanie of masses,
neither of people, but the Apointed and
Reuerend & Catholike maner of exequuting
the Mysteries.
               Item, It maie wel be doubted, whether
Dominus vobiscū, and, Orate prome
fratres (which wordes are in the decree)
were any part of the Liturgie of Rome in
Soters tyme. What harme I praie you
is in those wordes, that it might be well
douted, whether they were vsed so tymely
in the Church? In Dominus vobiscum,
our Lord be with you, the Priest saluteth
the pople Charitably and Godly,
And in Orate pro me, praie for me, he confesseth

hymselfe a synner, and req
                     •
                  ireth
their helpe, both de
                     •
                  outly and humbly.
But because the selfe same wordes are
now in the Masse, M. Iewell can not
brooke them, as he can neither the worde
Masse it selfe, for which in this place (
                     •
                  ul finely
forsoth) he vseth the terme of Liturgie
of Rome and not of Masse of Rome.
                  Fine M. Iewel.
And so he that can not abyde to haue S.
Chrysostomes Liturgie called A Masse
(which is our English worde, to signifie
that Seruice of the Church,Iew. 12. that answereth
the Liturgie of the Grecians)
he nowe lyke a mery Greeke, speaking
of that Seruice of Rome which was euer
called emong the Latinistes Missa, and
emong y• English, Masse: termeth it very

                     •
                  rymly in English, the Liturgie of Rome.
But let vs go forward.
               After all these foresaid Inuentions
to moue an Altercation and busynes about
the decree of Soter, he would make
the Catholikes afraied, as if he should
say: If you wil hold with Soters decree,
I will dryue you to an Inconuenience,
and therefore you were beste to let goe
your holdfast. But wha
                     •
                   is that Incon
                  
                     •
                  enience?

Mary saieth he, in that Soter
requireth, that the two (of whom he
s
                     •
                  eaketh) make answer vnto the Prieste,
there in is included both nearnesse of place,
for the people to stand in, and to heare, and
also a Common knowen tongue. Which
both are Contrarie to M. Hardinges Masse.
               
               But he standeth nigh inough, I

                     •
                  rowe, that standeth by the Aultare, and
he answereth in a Common knowē tongue,
that answereth in y• Latine tongue.
And both these thinges are done, by the
simple Parisshe Clerke, or litle boie that
serueth the Priest at Masse. And therefore
the decree of Soter hyndereth the
Catholikes, nothing at al. And if you
haue no more to obiect against it, than
these foresaid trifles, you maie either hold
your peace, or bring some other fressher
Argumentes.
               But other Argumentes you haue
none: Only you take it for a good sporte,
to note the questions whiche are moued
by the Canonistes about this Decree.
As, whether the two whose presence is required,
ought to be two Clerkes or two
laie men,Iew. 
                           •
                        8. or one Clerke and one laie mā, or

one man and one woman. The Resolution
whereof is, that they muste be two
Clerkes▪
                   Yet you declare out of Summa
Angelica, that in Priuate Masse one is sufficient.
And to this you alleage Gersons
Opinion, that the Priest maie wel saie,
Dominus vobi
                        •
                     cū, our Lord be with you,
though but one be present, because he
speaketh vnto the whole Churche of the
Faithful, and not to that one only, that

                   by hym. Or (as Innocentius

                     〈◊〉
                  ) because it maie be thought, there be
Angels there, to supplie the mens Rome.
               
               Thus you make some sport to your
selfe by rekenyng vp of the Canonistes
opinions, but what sad conclusion you
can pe
                     •
                  ke out thereof, againste Soters
Decree, it is not perceaued. Except you
wil reason after this sort, that, because the
Late Doc
                     •
                  ours or Rulers of the Church,
haue either expounded according to Charitie
the wordes of that Decree, Or haue
loosed according to their Authoritie, the
bond which was put vpon the Priestes
by the Positiue Law thereof: therefore

               The last quarel that M. Iewel hath

to Soters Decre, is that it maketh mention
of Secreta the Secretes of the Masse,
which to haue ben in the tyme of Soter,
it were very hard for D. Harding to proue.
For thē Euery peece of the Masse was spoken
alowde. But, how proue you th
                     ••
                  ?
For concernyng D. Harding, he maie
speake vpon some Authoritie, because he
alleageth the plaine wordes of Soters
Decree for it.
               
                  But it is not my purpose, exactly to
refel M. Iewels Argumentes made against
Soter: Only this I praie thee
now to consider (Indifferent Reader)
how many fetches and deuises he hath
in this place had, against that Decree of
his. Anacletus (quod he) as some saie, made
it: Then, Counterfeite Bookes haue bene
set abrode.A b
                        •
                     ndle of shiftes. 
                  Furthermore Decretal Epistles
haue ben doubted of. And more specially
to the mater, The practise (sa
                        •
                     eth
he) of S. Augustine and S. Hieromes tyme
can hardly stande with that is here imagined.
Againe, Solennia seemeth to import,
a resorte of people. Againe, it maie he wel
doubted whether Dominus vobiscū were
any part of the Liturgie of Rome in Soters
tyme. Againe, That any Secreta were in

the tyme of Soter, it were very hard for M.
Harding to proue. Then adde vnto this.
That question is moued by the Canonistes
what those two ought to be, whose presēce
is required, at the Priestes Masse. And first,
the Resolution is this, Straitwaies, The
mater is otherwyse determined. Then,
Gerson saieth this. Yet, Pope Innocentius
hath an other fetche.
               How thinke we now, hath this felow
lefte any corner vnsearched, out of
which he might scrape any Gheasse, coniecture,
or Suspition, to Diminisshe the
Authoritie of this decree of Soter? From
Generals which proued nothing, cummeth
he not to bare coniectures againste
the Specialties of the decree? When he
could saie no more against y• decree itselfe,
sought be not to bring it into contempte
by questions, Resolutions, & variations
of the Canonistes about it? Wel, M. Iewel,
you shall haue your asking. Let not
this be Pope Soters decree, whiche D.
Harding hath brought against you. And
that, which you, with so greate bending
of witte and turning of Bookes, haue
sought to conquer vs in, let vs (in triall
of a 
                     •
                  urther conclusion) yelde voluntaryly

vnto you. And so it remaineth, that it
be not vsed of any of vs, as an Auncient
Decree of Soter.
               Tel me then, wherefore doe you allege
it? This very Decree (Indifferent
Reader) about Discrediting and disgracing
of whiche, M. Iewel bestowed a
whole leafe together in his Replie, this
selfesame he vseth, not six leaues after, in
the selfesame Replie. But consider with
what Constancie he doeth it,Soters decree alo
                        •
                     wed by M. Iew. & with how
greate Reuerence towardes Aunciēt decrees.
His purpose was to disproue the
Priuate Masse, whiche Ioannes El

                     ius
an Auncient and holy Bishope is
reported to haue saied. His wordes be
these. M. Hardinges Leontius saieth, Iohn
the Almon

                     r saied Masse in his Oratorie at

                        •
                     ,Iew. 76. being sure of no more companie but
of one of his owne household seruāts alone.
               
               Here is a dubble lie.Ra. For neither
Leontius saieth so muche, neither D.
Harding gathereth it. For by Leontius,
it appeareth that be sene for A certaine
noble man to come vnto hym, as though
it had 
                     •
                  en aboute some mater of▪ the common
weale: And so, was the noble man

also present, at the priuate Masse with the
Bishopes seruant. And D. Harding gathereth
not that he was sure, of no more
cumpanie, but of one of his owne household
Seruantes alone, but rather, that he
was sure neither of the noble man, neither
of his seruant, that they could or
would receiue with hym. But of their
companie concerninge presence in the
place, though not in participation of the
Mysteries, he was so sure as one may be
of that whiche he presently seeth before
his eies, because both were with hym at
Masse and Answered hym. But this lye
of M. Iewel must be dissembled, if you
wil see how earnestly he allegeth the decree
of Soter. Suppose it then to be so,
(against both Leontius, and D. Hardinges
plaine saieinges) that the Bishoppe
was sure of no more but one, to be present
at his Masse. What can you laie against
him for it?
               Let vs consider (saie you) how safely he
might so doe by the order of holy Canons.Iew. 76.
               
               Why Syr,Ra. in breaking of them, what
daunger is there? Mary,
               To breake them,Iew Damasus saieth, is

blasphemie against the holy Ghost.
               Shew then, against what order of
holy Canōs, Ioannes Eleemosinarius hath
done in saying Masse, none but his seruaunt
(according to your sense) being
present?
               Pope Soter as it is before alleged by M.
Harding straightly commaundeth,Iew. that no
Priest presume to celebrate the Sacrament
without the cumpanie of two togeather.
               What say you M. Iewel?Ra. that very
Decree of Pope Soter against which not
fine leaues before you were so vehement,
is it compted now among the holy Canons?
That Decree, against which that
you might haue the more vantage, you
entered into a Cōmon place of bringing
the whole Booke of Decrees and Decrecretals
into discredite or contempt, (so
greate was your Stomake against Soter)
the same now do ye allege so formally,
and with so greate Charge commend
ye it vnto vs? For to breake the order
of holy Canōs (you say out of Damasus)
that it is blasphemy against the holy ghost.
               
               And where then was your modestie
(for Gods sake) when of the Decretal

Epistles, you vtter a Copie onely of tha

which lieth in your Store against them,Iew. 67.
affirming that they manifestly depraue &
abuse the Scriptures, Mainteine the kingdome
of the Pope, Publish a multitude of
vaine and superstious Ceremonies, Proclaime
open Lies? For if to breake the
order of holy Canons, it be blasphemie
against the holy Ghoste: How farre of
are you from the Sinne against the holy
Ghoste, which plainely doe contemne
Auncient Canons (as this of Soters) &
yet allege the selfesame afterward, which
you cōtemned before? For, if in speaking
against it, you folowed your Conscience,
could the same Conscience also permitte
you to hold with it? And if, on the other
side, your cōscience gaue you, that it was
Soters Decree (as in this place you allege
it for no lesse) was it not of plaine
malice, and directly against your owne
knowledge, that you busied your selfe so
much, as I haue declared, with seeking &

                     •
                  umpassing to deface it?
               Consider then (indifferent Reader)
and see by this which I haue declared,
whether M. Iewel vse not for his owne
poore va
                     •
                  tage, the self same Testimonies

of y• first six hundred yeres, which he striueth
most extremely to discredite, when y•
Catholikes doe allege them. Concerning
which poynt, if thow co
                     •
                  et to haue
moe examples, remember what he saith
against Dionysius,Iew. 
                        •
                     
                     ▪ 136. 66. 223. Sozomenus, The
Decrees and Epistles Decretal, and then
do no more but looke in the quotations
onely of his Replie, whether thou findest
them not alleged of him. And if thou
find them not, neuer trust me hereafter:
but if yu shalt perceiue, Dionysius, Sozomenus
& others to be brought in of him,
as occasion somtimes serueth, but y• Decrees
& Decretal Epistles to be so thickly
set in his Reply, as though he were some
great Canonist & Papist, & not the exact
folower of fine Diuinitie, thē haue I proued
my Obiection. And now what is he
worthy to haue, which so abuseth y• world
in setting vp & pulling downe of Auncient
& approued witnesses? For whereas
by writing & reasoning we seke alwayes
to come nerer and nerer to some Cōclusion,
by this libertie of Replieng which
M. Iew. foloweth, we shal be alwaies y•
further of from y• ending of cōtrouersies.

For if he would haue plainely sayed, you
shal bring forth no witnesse, except he liued
within the first six hundred yeares,
and of those very yeares I wil not allow
al witnesses, and especially the Decrees
and Decretals I refuse vtterly: then
would his Replie haue ben shorter by. xx
partes, & with more spede it should haue
ben answered, and with more facilitie it
would haue ben perceiued. But now,
when he is so vncertaine, that he can not
readily tel, what to allow or refuse, and
is so mutable, that he alloweth in some
one place the same which he disproued in
an other, how should it not be both cumberous
and iniurious? Cumberous,
because of the heaping of many Authorities
and Testimonies, such as him selfe
knoweth and maketh to be vncertaine &
doubtful: Iniurious, because of taking
away from an other, the free vse of those
writings, which himself with al boldnes
auoucheth. So y• when D. Harding allegeth
Pope Soters Decree, al the decrees
and Decretals should heare the worse for
it: And when M. Iewel allegeth the self
same Decree, s
                     ••
                  aitwaies it is blasphemie

against the holy ghost, to breake any of the
holy Canons.
               Such Hypocrits and wranglers, and
braggers, & Gospellers, by whose meanes

                  er
that they be detected.
            
            
               How M▪ Iewel allegeth, to smal purposes,
such Authorities of Fathers,
as do plainly cōfound y• procedings.
               BUt what shal we say? We are not
Masters of other mens wils? neither
do we beleue that this creature
(man) whom God hath made after
his owne Image, should lacke that power
of his soule, and gift of God, which
consisteth in free wil. If therfore men wil
not Beware, whē they may, what should
we do? I haue already declared in special
chapiters, such mater against M. Iewel,
that of al men that euer yet wrote,

there was neuer any of lesse Grauitie,
Sinceritie, or Cōscience in his writing.
To him that hath a wil to saue his soule,
so much is sufficient to make him seke after
better Instructiō: To him that thinketh
onely of Ciuile Policie, or of Temporal
life and liuing, and wil not trouble
his head with the euerlastingnes of the
Soule, and a worlde to come, no Argumentes
against M. Iewel can be sufficient.
But concerning them which would
in sad earnest saue one, and are not fully
resolued that M. Iewel behaueth himself
vnreasonablie & wickedly, may it please
them to consider, how he shal be yet better
taken in his Hypocrisie.
               To Antiquitie he appealeth: And
(because he would be sene to deale plainly)
he apointeth out the first six hundred
after Christ, for trial of the mater. Now
when some witnesses of that time come
against him, he wil not yet allow them.
               And yet when he hath taken them away
from his Aduersarie, him selfe for al that
wil afterwards allege them. And of these
points we haue spokē already: but what
may be added more, to the discouering of

his beha
                     •
                  iour? Mary this much I can

                  els, as he bringeth
in against the Catholiques, do in the self
same sentence y• he allegeth, geue a great
wound to his Religiō. So greedy he is
of tro
                     •
                  bling y• Catholikes peace, that to
make some of them shrinke, as if in deede
a blowe were cōming, he is content him
selfe to bring his owne cause into y• danger,
that he y• wil take the aduātage may
quikly so strike it, y• it wil neuer be good
after. And not only so, but so litle fauored

of one an other, and the Cosse, somuch
vsed in the primitiue Church? The
Church sence that tyme,Geauing of a cosse. hath chaunged
the maner of kissing, and kepte the signification
whiche was in it, by geauing of
the pax or peace.
               But this peace (say you) was not a litle
table of syluer or somwhat els,Iew. 153. as hath bene
vsed (yea and is still vsed) in the Churche
of Rome: but a very cosse in deede in token
of perfit peace and vnitie in faith and religion.
So Iustinus Martyr saieth speaking of
the tyme of the holy Mysteries: we salute
one an other with a cosse, So likewyse
Chrysostome and others.

so much of the practise in the Primitiue
Church, why doe ye not vse this so Auncient
and holy a Ceremonie? If you will
not haue the Pax of syluer, either for sparinge

(saieth he) to put haloued vessels, vnto priuate
vses: as Balthasar teacheth vs, vvhich, because he

kingdome and his life: If then it be so daungerous
a mater to put these sanctified vessels vnto
priuate vses, in vvhich the true bodie of Christ is
not, but the mysterie of his bodie is conteined: hovv
much more behoueth it vs concerning the vessels of
our bodie, vhich God hath prepared for himselfe
to dvvel in, not to geaue the deuil place to doe in
them vvhat he vvil?

Monasteries standing with them? Why
are not olde Ceremonies obserued? Why

persons. And herevpon (as the

                  s the Emperour,
that they might haue the cause of
Cecilianus examined, before the Bishopes
of beyond the seas. In which point,
S. Augustine findeth, that they had a
duble fetche and subtiltie.
               The one, that if those Bishoppes,
whom the Emperour had procured to

                  e him, then would he with
his fellowes say, that the Iudges were
not indifferent, and so, by consequence,
appeale from them. In which case,
though (as S. Augustin saith) there remained
a general Councel of the vniuerfal
Church, in which the cause betweene
them and their Iudges, shoulde haue
ben handeled, yet what did they? Mary,
they went to the Emperour, and accused

the foresaid Bishopes before him. And
how was this taken (thinke we) of the
Catholikes? Uerely not wel, as appeereth
by S. Augustine, which noteth the
Donatistes of folish boldnes therein.
               Iudices enim Ecclesiastic
                     •
                  s &c.August. Epist. 16
                        •
                     . For the
Ecclesiastical Iudges, Bishopes of so great Authoritie,
by vvhose sentence and iudgement both the
Innocencie of Cecilianus, and their naughtiness
                     •
                  
vvas declared (these men of such worthines
saith S. Augustine) they durst accuse,

                  vvebishopes and Collegies,
but vnto the Emperour, that they had 
                     〈◊〉
                  
iudged vvel.
               But now, when they had broken the
order of the Ecclesiastical Law, and were
come to the Emperour, what did he?
Did he commende their Obedience, or
Wisedome? Did he preferre his owne
Courte and Authoritie, before the Consisto
                     •
                  ie
and Iudgement of Bishoppes?
What he did, the Actes and Registers
of his owne Courte declare, as S. Austine
recordeth out of it. For after y• Donatistes
were now cōdemned by y• Pope
of Rome & other Bishopes assistant, and

refused to stand to their sentence, requiring
helpe at the Emperours handes:
Dedit ille aliud Iudicium Arelatense, aliorum
scilicet Episcoporum: He gaue and appointed vnto
them other Iudges at Arles, I meane other Bisshoppes
               
               Why: if the Emperour had in those
daies taken the Pope for chiefe Bishope
in al the worlde, would he haue further
committed, vnto the Bishop of Arls, the
sitting vpon that cause, which already
was decided by the Bishop of Rome?
               It seemeth altogeather vnlikely: And
therefore M. Iewel may be thought to
bring in deede an inuincible Argument
for the Emperours Supremacie, against
the Supremacie of the Bishop of Rome.
               But marke the Circumstances and
Considerations which moued the Emperour,
and then wil the contrary conclusion
be manifestly proued, that the
Emperour tooke him selfe to be the inferiour
vnto Bishops, euen in that cause,
which was brought vnto him after Bishopes,
and which he caused to be examined
againe, after it was sufficiently iudged.
For thus it foloweth in S. Austin.
               
                  
Dedit ille aliud Arelatense Iudicium, non
quia iam necesse erat, sed eorum peruersitatibus
cedens & omnimodo cupiens tantam Impudentiam
Cohibere. That is, He gaue other Iudges,
not because it vvas novv necessarie, but because
be yelded to the frovvardnes of them (the Donatistes)
and desired by al meanes, to restraine
so great Impudencie of them. Neque enim a

and that although he heard their

God, that they once yet vvould yeelde vnto the
truth.
               Consider now indifferently with me,
vpon this whole mater (gentle Reader)
And this appealing of the Donatists vnto
the Emperour, and his hearing of the
whole cause, being not once or twise, but
very oft alleged by M. Iew. it is worth
while to be wel remembred, that which
I haue already said, & that which by occasion
hereof may be further gathered,
and wel be noted.
               See then first, what busie Heretikes
these Donatistes were, and how ful they
were of Shiftes and Quarels making:
From the Emperour to Rome: From
Rome they go to the Emperour againe:
From him then by appointement and agreement,
they goe to Arls and the Bisshops
there: And frō Arls, they returne,
with complaint, to the Emperour yet
againe. At last, the Emperour himself
heareth y• cause, yet would they not stand
to the Emperours sentence, but mainteined

stil their false Bishope, whom to
put in the See of Carthage, they thruste
out Cecilian, and they continued stil in
their heresie, accompting al the Christians
of y• world accursed, which were not
of the syde of Donatus.
               Such is the nature and practise of
Heretikes, they pretend conscience, they
commend holy and Auncient Fathers,
They appeale to the Primitiue Church:
They craue for General Councels, for
free disputations, for surcease of Inquisition,
for Seruice in the vulgar tongue,

And confirme their Gospel by

               These and suche like thinges we in
our daies see by experience. Constantinus
the Emperour dyd not see so much:
Yet fearing the busie nature of Schysmatykes,
and hoping by faire demeanes
to bring the Donatistes to a peace with
al Christendome, he yelded as much vnto
them as he could, and (as ye haue heard)
he receiued theyr prouoking to hym, not
because he thought that hym selfe was
the chiefest Iudge in all the world, euen
in maters Ecclesiastical, but because he
hoped, in yelding vnto the Donatistes
in al their requestes aboute apointynge
or changing of y• Iudges, to bring them
at length vnto suche a remembrance of
themselues, that they should cease, for
shame, to make any further brable about
that, in which by euery Iudge that dyd
heare the cause, they were condemned.
               Now, if at those daies, either the wyse
and lerned aboute hym, or he hymselfe,
had beleued the hearing of causes Ecclesiastical

to belong vnto his court or consistorie,
what needed hym to borowe
                     •
                  
point of the law, & to accompte vpon askyng
of pardon of the Bishopes, for his
meddling with that cause, which they alreadie
had ended? Can we haue any
thing more plaine and manifest, that this
Christian and wor
                     •
                  hie Emperour, dyd
in conscience thinke himself to base to sit
and Iudge after Bishopes, whereas
enforced thereunto by the importunitie
of the Donatistes, and trusting, by that
his yelding, to pacifie the commotion
y• was reysed in the catholike Church, yet
was not sure of his doeinges herein, but
determined to aske forgeauenes of the
holy Bishopes?
               As if he should saie: The Donatistes
here, trouble the Church, They appeale
vnto me, as though I were chiefe. If
I wil not heare their cause, there is no
man shal Rule them: And if I take open
me to heare it, the Bishops, which alreahaue
decided it, wil be offended. Wel, I
wil venter yet, And if the Donatistes
wil stand to my iudgement, and be quiet
for euer after, that is so greate a benefite,

that to cumpasse it, I maie stretche my
conscience. And if, for al that pretense, my
fact shal be misliked, I wil aske pardon
of the holy Bishopes, which haue alreadie
iudged of the mater, This is the very
trueth of the Emperours receiuing of
the Donatistes Appeale. He dyd it vpon
occasion, and if it were not wel done, he
was readie to take a pardon for it. In
all thinges he sought the beste waie to
helpe the Church, and shewed his moste
due, and humble, and Obedient affection
towardes Bishopes.
               
                  Yet doth M. Iewel bring in this
Story,Iew. 272 to proue that It is vvel knovven, that
Appeales euen in the Ecclesiastical causes, vvere
made to the Emperours and Ciuil Princes. Seconly,
that the Bishope of Rome determined such cases
of Appeale, by vvarrant and commission from
the Emperour. Thirdly, that maters being heard
and determined by the Bishope of Rome, haue
ben, by Appeale from him, remoued further vnto
others. Which Conclusion wil seeme well
inough to folowe vpon the Appeale of
the Donatistes vnto y• Emperour, and
y• Emperours sending of them first vnto
the Bishope of Rome, and then to the

Bishope of Arles, but consider the mater

further.
                  The third Example.
               
               The Councel of Antioche deposed Pope
Iulius:Iew. 289 Yet was not Iulius therfore deposed.
               This you bring in (M. Iewel) to
declare,R
                        •
                     . that the sentence geuen in Councels
was not alwaies put in execution.
To which I answer, that if the Councel
be lawfull and Catholike, the decrees
ought to be put in 
                     〈◊〉
                  : if thei be not,
it foloweth not, that the Sentence of the
Councel maie be 
                     〈◊〉
                  , or neglected,
but that they which being of Authoritie
do not see the Councels 
                     〈…〉
                  ,
are to be 
                     〈…〉
                  
Councels, neither their 
                     〈…〉
                  
their examples are to be 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
               
                  
You reason muche like, as if one
should saie against the Obedience due
vnto the priuye Councel of a Realme:
The Sonnes of King Dauid, the Capitanes
of the hostes, Abiathar also the high
Priest, consented and agreed, saieing:
Viuat Rex Adonias, God saue Adonias
the King, and yet Adonias was not king,
ergo the Proclamations or Determinations
of lawful Authoritie maie be litle
estemed. For this Councel of Antioche,
was a Schismatical assemble, and wheras
they deposed hym, ouer whom they
had no Authoritie, there is no absurditie
at al, nor fault to be laied vnto any mans
charge, that wil not obey, or lyke their
procedings & doings therein. But when
y• lawful & head Bishope of the worlde,
doth define and subscribe in a Generall
Councel, though there folow no execution
in acte, yet there is one to be done
by right. And it can be no sufficient excuse
before God, when the conscience shal be
examined, to allege, that because Schismatikes
decrees haue not ben executed,
therfore the Obedience which is due to
the Sentence of Catholikes, maie be

diminished. But see yet an other Exāple.
               M. Iewel wil proue that Bishops
of other Countries, neuer yeelded to the
Popes Supremacie. For faith he:
               The Bishopes of the East,The. 4. Example. writing vnto
Iulius, allege that the faith that then was
in Rome,Iew. 278 came first from them, and that
their Churches, as Sozomenus writeth,
ought not to be accompted inferiour to th
                     •
                  
Church of Rome: And as Socrates further
reporteth, that they ought not to be ordered
by the Romaine Bishope.
               You haue much to do M. Iewel
with the Bishopes of the Easte,R
                        •
                     . and no
man, I thinke, that readeth your Booke
wil iudge otherwise, but that they were
learned and good men, such as whose opinions
both your selfe allow, and commend
vnto others to be regarded. And
truely, if they were such men, I wil say
nothing, but that he that is disposed, may
esteeme their sayinges: but, if it shal be
proued most manifestly, y• thei were rank
and obstinate Arrians, then truely, the
more ignominiously and cōtemptuously
they spak against the Bishops of Rome,
the better they do declare, of what kind

and succession they are at this present,
which set their whole studies against the
See Apostolyke, and will not be ruled by
the highest Bishop in Christendom.
               For proufe of your assertion, you
refer vs to Sozomenus, and Socrates,
Auncient and lawful Historiographers,
whome we also do admit. And, as
though any man would striue with you
herevpon, that the Bishopes of the East,
did not so litle set by y• Bishop of Romes
Authoritie, as you seme to gather, you
put in the margen the greeke text it self,
that he which knoweth no greeke at all
may yet say to him selfe: Bir Lady M.
Iewel alleageth y• expresse Text for himselfe,
and it apeareth by y• English therof,
that the Bishopes of the East made
no such accompt of the Pope, as at these
Daies is allowed.
               But what shall we say? It can not
be denied,Arrians alleaged by M. Iewel ful

Socrates speake, did take themselues to

Hitherto is the storie as I gather it out
of Socrates and Sozomenus.
               Consider now of it indifferent Reader.
               Was Athanasius an holy Bishope,
or no? Was he a most worthy and tried
defendour of the Catholike faith, or no?

him against al his enemies, or no? Eusebius,

him to vse Uiolence against them: the
Catholike people of Constantinople, Alexandria,
and other places, would haue
honored and Obeyed them stil, as their
owne true and lauful Bishopes.
               Of which it is easy to gather,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     . that,

                   very much by y• Bishop of Romes
letters and sentence: And then, that the
Catholik and deuout people also of those
quarters, did regard and obey the same:
Thirdly, that such as resisted then the

Authoritie of y• Bishope of Rome, were
plaine Arrians. And last of al, that it was
not done by law or any order, that those
holy Bishopes, Athanasius, Paulus &c.
enioyed not the right of their own See

               How litle then doth this Example
of the Arrian Bishoppes make for M.
Iewels purpose? Yea rather, how much
doth it make cleane against hym? For
when wicked and nawghtie mens factes
are put furth in writing, they are for this
end put furth, to be abhorred, and not to
be folowed: As Cains murdering of his
brother, or Iudas betrayinge of his
Master.
               Yet, when the persons are notorious,
as Cain and I

when Historiographers are brought in,

                   heretikes are made to

put furth as an Example to be folowed,

                   to folowe them.
               And in this arte M. Iewel is a doctor.
For if he would haue expressely said,
The Arrians and Heretikes of the Easte
Church whē they had wrongfully expelled
the catholikes and good Bispopes, Paulus,
Athanasius, &c. out of their sees, they contemned
the Bishope of Romes letters by
which they were required to receiue them
againe, and to set aside al Iniurie and new
                     
                        •
                     anglenes:
Ergo the Bishope of Rome is
supreame head of the Church: If M. Iewel
would after this open and plain
                     •
                  
manner haue vsed hymselfe, there is not,
I suppose, so vnsensible A Protestant,
which would not haue iudged hym, to
haue reasoned very folishly.
               But now whiles he geueth them no
worse name than the Bishops of the East,

Readers, that they were Heretikes and
Arrians, he maketh them to thinke, that
al is wel, And that these Bishopes were
men of much credite and worthines, and
that not only late Gospellers, but old
Catholique Fathers also, haue denied
Obedience to the Bishoppe of Rome.
Whiche thinges being altogether otherwise,
the Readers are driuen into perdition:
And M. Iewel either seeth not
that an Argument brought from the Authoritie
of blasphemous heretikes is nothing
worth (which is incredible in him
that hath so greate insigh

his purposes to an end, by what meanes

it agreeth very wel both with the desperatnes
of his cause and of his stomake.
               
                  BEVVARE therefore (Indifferent Reader)
of M. Iewel, and knowe this for
most certeine, that as I haue declared by
a few Examples in this Chapiter that he
allegeth the condemned sayinges and
doings of Heretikes vnder the colour

Catholike and approued witnesses, so in
many moe places of his Replie, he doth
in like maner, abuse them most shamfully.
But of them thou shalt reade in other
Bookes.
               And what now is there more (M.
Iewel) that ye wil require or vse against
vs? To the first six hundred yeres only
you haue appealed, your selfe yet do vse
the testimonies of al ages. To the first
six hundred only you haue appealed, and
yet against the approued writers of that
selfe tyme, you haue excepted. Besydes
this as though ther were not to be found
Catholike witnesses inough in the cause
of the catholike Faith, you couertly bring
in against vs, the accursed sayinges and
do
                     •
                  inges of Heretikes. Which one point
excepted (that you shal not in question of
the Catholyke Faith and Tradition▪
make any old Heretikes Iudges in the
cause, Or witnesses) for the reste I dare
graunt vnto you, to take your vantage,
where you can finde it.
               But hauing so large cumpasse graunted
vnto you, against the expresse reason
& Equitie which should be in your Chalenge,

shal it not become you, to vse this
priuilege discreetly and truly? And so to
allege your witnesses, as in deede they
meane in their owne sense, without false
applying thereof: And as they speake in
their owne tongue, without adding vnto
their say inges, or taking awaie from
them, any thing that is of the substance of
their verdicte? Thus, whether you doe
obserue or no, let it be tried.
               And that it maie be tried the better,
I wil briefely and plainely proue against
you (M. Iewel) before any indifferent
Reader: First, y• you haue abused Councels,
then Lawes, Canon and Ciuil:
Thirdly, Fathers and Doctours, Auncient
and Late: And that ye haue spared
no kind of writer that came in your way.
            
            
               How M. Iewel hath abused
Councels.
               COuncels, in one sense, are abused,
when that which is found in them
to be condemned, is brought furth
by any Protestant as though it were approued.

As in example wheras D. Harding
concluded, vpon the profite which
cometh of celebrating the memorie of our
Lords Passion, that the Sacrifice of the
Aultar, which is made in remembrance
therof, shuld not be intermitted, although
the people would not communicate: M.
Iewel,
               To adde a lytle more weighte to this
seely reason, saieth further in D. Hardings
behalfe.
               If this Sacrifice be so necessarie,Iews. 15. as it is
supposed, then is the Priest bound to Sacrifice
euery daie, yea although he him selfe
Receaue not.
               But howe proueth he this?Ra. it foloweth.
               For the Sacrifice and the receauing are
sundrie thinges.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
               
               And what of that?Ra. For although
Communion bread and wine be sundrie
thinges, yet you wil not permit the Receiuing
of the Lords supper in one kinde
o
                     •
                  ly. And so although Sacrifice and
Receiuing be distinct: yet doth it not folow,
that a Priest maie offer and not receaue.
But you wil proue it, by better
Authoritie then your owne, for thus

you saie.
               As it is also noted in a late Councel
holden at 
                     •
                  oledo in Spaine.Iew. Quidam
Sacerdotes & caet. Certaine Priestes there
be, that euery day offer many Sacrifices,
and yet in euery Sacrifice withhold themselfe
from the Communion.
               What is your Ergo then vpon this
place?Ra. Your Conclusion should be, Ergo
A Priest maie Sacrifice, although he himselfe
doe not Receaue. But can you gather
this out of the Councel? Doth it not
rather make expressely to the contrarie?
Doth it not reproue the Priestes, which
Sacrifice, & Receue not? Let the place be
considered, & then conferred with M. Iewels
collection. The whole place is this.

the offering of the body and bloud of our Sauiour

behold, the Apostle saieth, doe not they eate the
Sacrificies, vvhich are partakers of the Aultar?
Certaine it is, that they vvhich doe Sacrifice and
doe not eate, are giltie of the Sacrament of our

Priest shal come to the Diuine Aultar to offer vp
Sacrifice, and vvithhold himselfe from the Communion,

maner of sacrifice shal that be, of vvhich no not he
that doth Sacrifice, is knovven to be partaker?
Therefore, by all meanes it must be obserued, that
as oft as the Sacrificer doth offer and Sacrifice
vpon the Aultar the bodie and bloud of our Lord
Iesus Christ, so ofte he geue himselfe to be partaker
of the bodie & bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ.
Hitherto the Councel of Toledo.
               
               How thinke we then? Hath not M.
Iewel properly alleged it for his purpose?
could he haue brought a place, more
plaine against himselfe? M. Iewel saieth
that Sacrifice and Receiuing are sundrie
thinges: And meaneth thereby,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   that the
priest may do y• one & leaue the other, that

is, Offer and not Receiue: the Councel
defineth, that what so euer Priest do Offer
and not Receiue, he shalbe kept away
from the Communion a tweluemonth
togeather. And what other thing is
this to say, then that Sacrifice and Communion
are so sundrie, that the Priest for
al that, can not put them a sunder, Or do
one without the other? Thus hath M.
Iewel, to put more weight to his seely
reason, confirmed it by a fact condemned
by the same Councel, in which it is foūd
reported. And this is one way of Abusing
of Councels.
               In an other kinde, it is an abusing
of Councels, when that is Attributed
vnto them which at al is not in them.
As in Example.
               The Intention (saith M.
                  Iewel. 
                  Iewel)
of the Churche of Rome, is, to woorke
the Transubstantiation of bread and wine,Flat lye.
The Grek church had neuer that Intentiō,
as it is plaine by the Coūcel of Florence.
               Thus you say M. Iewel,Ra. and in
the Margin you referre vs to the last session
of the Councel of Florence, but in
that Session there is no mention at al of

Trāsubstantiation, Or, Intention. The
greatest and the only mater, therein Discussed
and defined, was, concerning the
Pr
                     •
                  ceding of God the Holyghost from
the Father and the Sonne, in which
point the Grecians then were at one wt
the Latines. It folowed then, after
a few dayes that the vnion was made,
that the Bishop of Rome sent for the
Grecians, and asked of them certaine
questions, concerning their Priestes
and Bishopes, and Anoynting of their
dead, & Praiers in the
                     ••
                   Liturgie, and
choosing of their Patriarches.
               But it was neither Demaunded of
them what Intention they had in Consecrating,
Neither Aunswered they any
thing to any such effect, Neither did the
Bishop open vnto them, his Faith and
beliefe therein. So that altogether it is
a very flat lye, that M. Iewel here maketh
vpon that Councel. Except he
meane the Doctrine that there foloweth
geauen to the Armenians, in which Trā
                  substantiation
and Intention both is cō
                  prehended,
wh
                     •
                  revnto the Sacred Coū
                  cel
whe
                     ••
                  of the Grecians were a parte,

gaue their consent.
               A third maner of Abusing Councels,
is, to allege them truely in dede as they
say, but yet to allege them to no purpose.
As in example. The fourth Councel of
Carthage decreed, that in certaine cases,
the Sacrament should be powred into
the sicke mans mouth. of which worde
(powred) being proper only to thinges
that are fluent and liquide, D. Harding
gathereth, that the Sacrament whiche
they receaued, was in the forme of win
                     •
                  ,
and not of bread. Herevpon M. Iewel
commeth against him, and he calleth
it a Gheasse, that the bread can not be
powred into a sicke mans mouth. But
howe proueth he it to be but a Gheasse?
Or what sayeth he to the contrarie? It
foloweth.
               And yet he maie learne,Iew. 140. Concil. by the thirde
Councel of Carthage, and by the abridgement
of the Councel of Hippo,Carth. 
                        •
                     
                     ▪ Ca. 6. that the
Sacrament was then put into dead mens
mouthes.
               Your Argument then is this:Ra. One
(y• is so foolish or superstitious) may put
the Sacrament into a dead mans mouth,

Ergo D. Harding doth not gheasse wel,A worthy cōsequēce of M. Iewels.
that bread can not be powred into a sicke
mans mouth. But al thinges are here
vnlike, both Persons, and Actes, and
Termes.
               First of al, dead men are distincted
from Sicke men, and the dead you may
order violentlie, but the sicke wil be vsed
Reasonablie, except none but Enemies
be about them.
               Then, in the one side, the Act is vnlauful
(to put the Sacrament in a dead
mans mouth) On the other, it is lauful
(to power it into a sicke mans mouth).
               Beside this, Putting is one thing,
and Pouring is an other, and whether it
be bread or wine, you may be suffered to
say, that they are put into the mouth, but
how bread should be poured into ones
mouth, except in al haste you minded to
choke him or fil him, I can not tel.
               Last of al, the terme Sacrament, which
is forbidden to be put in the dead mans
mouth, may signifie any of the two kindes:
That is, either of Bread or wine▪
but in naming the Bread, you are bound
to that one kinde only of the Sacrament,

and must not meane thereby, wine. So
that there is neither Rime nor Reason in
it, to tel vs ful solemlie, that the Sacrament
was put in dead mens mouthes,
the Propositiō, which you therby would
disproue, being onely this, that Bread
can not be poured into sicke mens mouthes.
And therefore to speake the least,
and best of it, this is a very vain and idle
Abusing of the Authorities of Councels.
               But of al other it passeth, when M.
Iewel taketh,Marke this trick. as much as pleaseth him,
of any Canon of Councel, and maketh a
ful point before he come to the end of the
Sentence: Mainteining his Heresie,
by that Peece which he pulleth away,
And dissembling that which remaineth,
by which his Obiection should be straitwaies
refelled. For otherwise, to reherse
no more of a Canon, than serueth
our purpose, it is cōmon and tolerable.
But when that point which an Heretike
leaueth out, pertaineth to the qualifying
of that other Peece, which he would haue
to be vnderstand absolutely, that is such
a point of an Heretike, as may wel cause
any reasonable mā to BEVVARE of him.
               
                  
But is it possible, that M. Iewel
maie be taken in this fault? If he be not,
then wil I graunt, that he hath not, in
as Ample and Shamfull maner abused
Councels, as any of the most Desperate,
of all that euer wrote. And if he be, I
aske nomore, but that he may goe for
such as he is. The Example shal make
this plaine.
               In the Councel of Laodicea it is decreed
like as also in the Councell of Carthage,Iew. 153.
that nothing be readde in the Church vnto
the people, sauing only the Canonical
Scriptures.
               I wonder then, what your Homelies
doe in the Church,Ra. except you thinke
that they be Canonical Scriptures,What answerye? Or
els, that you so precise folowers of Antiquitie,
are not bound to the Canons of
Auncient Councels. But as I doe graūt
vnto you, that the Councel of La
                     •
                  dicea
hath, that such only bookes as are of the
old & new Testamēt should be readen in
the Church, so, that y• 
                  like also is declared
(as you boldly say) in the Councel of Carthage,
it is so manifestly vntrue, y• it may
not be suffered. For these are the verie

wordes of the Councel.
                     
                        〈…〉

                        〈…〉

                  ihil in Ecclesia legatur sub nomine Diuinarum
Scripturarum.Can. 47. 
                  that is, Vve like it also,
that nothing besides the Canonical Scriptures be
readen in the Church, in the name of the Diuine
Scriptures.
               The Councel therefore forbiddeth not
other things bysides the Canonical scriptures
to be readen in the Church, but it
prouideth, that nothing be readen there,
as in the name of Scripture which is not true
Scripture in dede. And this appeereth
most euidently by other wordes, which
folowe in the selfe same Canon where it
is sayed.
               Liceat etiam legi Passiones Martyrum, Cum
Anniuersarij eorū celebrantur. Be it lauful also
to haue the Passions of Martyrs readen, vvhen
their yerely Daies are celebrated and kept holy.
               By this,Passions of Martyrs readē in y• Church, & their yeerely daies kept it is most euident, that other
thinges bysydes the Canonicall Scriptures,
as the Passions of Martyrs (such
vndoutedly as we haue, for a great part,
in the Legends of the Church) were permitted
to be readen in the publike Seruice:
And that M. Iewels comparison

(that the Lessons then read in y• Church
were taken out of y• 
                  holy Bible (ONLY as
he meneth) as it is now vsed in the church
of England,) hath no agreablenes and
Proportion. For wh
                     •
                  t one Martyr is
there in al the whole booke of the Common
praier of England (S. S

                  euen only
excepted) which hath any Festiual
day appointed out for him, or any storie
of his Passion declared?
               But like perfite Diuines, you wil
no other thing, but Scripture onely readen
in your Churches: in which pointe,
you would be seene to follow the Councel
of Carthage. You deceaue the people,

might be deliuered of the burden of their

Receiuing euerie Sondaie are two thinges.
To prouide, that the people should
Offer Bread and Wine euerie Sondaie,
it was necessary, because, that is the proper
mater of which the Sacrament of the
Aultare is made, and because the Clergie

                  re was some one or other of the
laie people, that Receaued alwaies on
Sondaie, in one kinde, at the leaste, with
the Priest, because an holy loafe (as we
cal it) was Offered euery Sondaie.
               But consider yet further (Indifferent
Reader) how finely and properly,
M. Iewel gathereth Argumentes out of
Auncient Popes decrees. He noteth, out
of the foresaied wordes, not only that
men and women Receaued euery Sondaie,
but also that they Offered bread and
Wine euery Sondaie, according to the
Order of Melchisedech. By which accompte,
so manie Priestes and Sacrificers
were in the Church, as were men

and women that offered bread and wine.
               Yea, not only men, and women that
are of perfitte discreation, but all the
bo
                     •
                  es and wenches of the Parishe, may,
with litle charges, be quickly within orders.
For, as M. Iewel compteth, there
is no more in it, but to Offer bread and
wine to the Aultare, and straitewaies al
that doe so, are Priestes, after the Order
of Melchisedech.
               
               But if that be so, how is the order
of Melchisedech more perfitte, than the
Order of Aaron? Or how was there such
a Religion and Reuerence aboute the
order of Aaron, that none but of a certaine
tribe should be made Priestes, neither
they also, without vocation and consecration:
if to the order of Melchisedech
(at yt coming of which, that of Aaron is
perfited and accomplished) euery woman
be within the Order, by offering of bread
and wine to the Aultar? You M. Iewel
that haue such knowledge in the vnderstanding
of the Popes decrees, are you
Ignorant in the law of Moyses? Remember
you not,Leu.

order of Aaron only.

The cause of making this decree, was
the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of the Deacons. And, the Singging▪
which was forbidden them, was

no such Singing, as is vsed in Reading
of a Gospel.
               
                  
To speake also of the Priest, thinketh
M. Iewel, that the Masse which he
celebrated solemlie in S. Grigories time
was of his part celebrated without note?
And that in beginning of, Gloria in
excelsis, Or in saying of, Dominus
vobiscum, Or, Sursum corda, and so
furth in the Preface, he sang 
                     〈◊〉

                  ? The contrary
is so cleare, that the note which is
vsed in the Church in prefaces of y• Masse
and in halowing of the Font, which are
done by a Priest only or Bishop, is called
Cantus Gregorianus.
               
               But goe to M. Iewel, proceede in
your Abusing of Decrees: If singing be
not fit for a Priest, for whom is it fitte?
You answer that:
               Certeinly,Iew. it seemeth that S. Gregorie

Concerning the Interpr
                     •
                  tation: it is
two thinges, to say, Al Bishopes that are
bound to haue their orders of the Apostolike
See. And, Al Bishopes that are boūd
to haue their Orders confirmed by the Apostolike
See: Because y• second is twenty
times larger then the first. Of the
first Anacletus speaketh, meaning that
al they, which are immediately subiect to
the Bishop of Rome, and take Orders
immediatlie at his hands, shal (as it foloweth
in the Decree) com or send yerely
about the Ides of May, to S. Peter &
Paules Church in Rome. Of the Second
M. Iewel speaketh, which are out
of the peculier Prouince of the Bishope
of Rome, And which yet, when they are
by their Clerg
                     •
                   named & elected at home
must be afterwards confirmed by the B.
of Rome, and ar
                     •
                   so ordeined and consecrated
in their 
                     〈◊〉
                   Prouince: So that
the Bishopes of Italie, are ordeined and
confirmed both, by the B. of Rome: but
the Bishoppes of Fraunce or England
(when it was good) are not made by
him, but confirmed, that is to say (as the
woorde i

which other haue or shal doe.
               The Interpretation therfore of M.
Iewels is false: so is also his collection
and Argument. For, although al the
Bishopes that are vnder the Bishope of
Rome, and boūd to receiue their orders
at his handes immediatelie, although al
these (I say) be within Italie onely, or
nigh thereabout, as farre as his special
Prouince goeth, yet doth it not follow
therevpon, that the Bishope of Arls, or
Caunterburie are not at al subiect vnto
him. Like as in an Armie, where y• King
him selfe is present, when he shal diuid
                     •
                  
the battel, and appoint the gouern

                  men
                     •
                  
of diuerse bandes to diuerse Capitaines,
reseruing to him selfe one emong al of
which he, by him self, wil haue y• charge:
Although these now that he hath chosen
out, be al that he hath to sette in aray and
order by him self, yet must you 
                     〈◊〉
                   infer,
that he hath no Authoritie ouer the other
partes of the Armie, because he doth not
as immediately gouerne the whole, as
his special parte? For, Immedia
                     •
                  elie,
but one part is vnder his charge, but by
meanes of his Capitaines, whom he onlie

hath appointed, & whom he againe by
his authority mai vterly displace, or other
wife 
                     〈…〉
                   he is King ouer the whole.
So is 
                     〈…〉
                   B. of Rome. His authoritie
is as 
                     〈◊〉
                  , 
                     •

               Now, because the faithful are so multiplied,
that one man by himselfe, can not

his own part, other Bishops be his
fellowes, as laboring to the perfection of
that whole, in which euery of them hath
also a part. Concerning the whole, some
are Archebishops, & Primates, some Patriarches,
euery one of a larger Iurisdiction
then other, and one alone, is

                  o
                     •
                  e.
               This distinctiō then being most plain
& manifest, that Rule and Gouernement,
is put in practise, both Immediatlie by y•
Rulers owne Act, And Mediatlie, or by
meanes of other: to take away the secōd
by affirming y• first, wheras first & second
do in sundry respec
                     •
                  es wel st̄ad together,
it is without reason or consequence. As,
if one would say, The King chargeth al
his Lords & Officers about him, to mete
where he hath appointed, ergo it may be
gathered, that no other with
                     ••
                   England
beside them of y• Co
                     •
                  rt, are bound to appeere
where he shal appoi
                     •
                  te them.
               
                  
And so doth M. Iewel reason, Al Bisshopes
that are bound to take their Orders,
(or as he falsi
                     •
                  ieth the text, to haue
their Orders confirmed) by the Apostolique
See, must (as it foloweth in the
Law) come or send yearely to Rome:
Ergo other Bishopes that are not Immediatly,
but Mediatly vnder him, are
not subiect to the ordinaunce of that See.
               Note also, that whereas the Decree
of Ana
                     •
                  letus, is concerning the yearely
comming of Bishopes to Rome▪ and not
of any other point of Obedience and dutie:
M. Iewel might wel argue thus.
               The Bishopes onely of Italie, that are
subiect to the Apostolique See, are boūd

                     •
                  er
                     •
                  ly to come to Rome, &c. Ergo the
Bishoppes of other Countries, that are
further of, are not bound to come yerely

                     •
                  hither. But, from this one particular
for which onely the Decree was made, to
reason gen
                     •
                  rally, of the Obedience and
Subiection due to the ordinaunce of that
See, it is Sophistically and Unreasonably
done.
               By this I moue then sufficiently, y•
he hath abused the Canon Law.
            
            
               
               How M. Iewel abuseth the
very Gloses of the
Canon law.
               BUt doth his boldnesse stretch no
further, than to the Text? or doth he
not corrupt also the Gloses? verely
he leaueth neither them vntouched,

                     •
                  hat is to say, vncorrupted. For if M.
Iewel once touche a place, it is very

                     •
                  ard but it wil be the worse for his handling.
And cause truly he hath none, why
he should allege any Glose of the Canon
law, at al. For whereas himselfe regardeth
not, no not the Text it selfe, and the
Catholiks also wil not be bound to make

                     •
                  ood the priuate say
                     •
                  ing of any Gloser, it
is a greate vanitie, to bring in such 
                     •
                  itnesses,
as him selfe may well knowe are
not sufficient. Yet, though I say so, 
                     •
                  e
shall not require of me, to mocke straitewayes
at any Gloses, Or to bring furth
vnto y• knowlege of the si
                     •
                  e wittes of y•
worlde, some simple deuises and dis

that they haue made, to the
                     •
                  tent thei
may be laughed at. For there are Degrees
in euery thing, and he that wil not
be so good as to praise euery Inuention
of the Glose, needeth not to be so il, as to
seeke how to finde fault with it, but may
wel inough be suffered to hold his peace.
               Now concerning M. Iewels behauiour,
if he hath such an itche, yt he thinketh
to rubbe vs on the gal, by alleaging
such witnesses as we may and do laufully
refuse, Why doth he not allege them
truely? Why doth he tel their tale after
them in such sort, as he findeth not in
their owne words? Why doth he (vpon
this preiudice emong the greater number
that Glosers are but Ignorante and
trifling men) bring forth blind and vain
sentences out of them, which in dede are
not theirs, (though it wil be easily susspected)
but M. Iewels: whome many
compte so honest, that he wil not in any
case make a Lie, or missuse his own witnesses
in any point?
               This Obiection of mine, to Exemplifie
or Prosequ
                     •
                  te at large, I doo

                   not
intend, but, in one or two examples, I

wil beginne the Chapiter, that he which
herafter wil adde more vnto it, may haue
a plaine & peculiar place where to put it.
               In the Answere to D. Hardinges
Preface, it pleaseth M. Iew. to open his
mouth awide, and to auouch that the
Pope speaketh after this maner.
               I can do what so euer Christ him self
can do:Iewel i

                      y• Answer to D. Hardings Preface. I am al, and aboue al: Al power is
geuen to me, as wel in Heauen as in Earth.
               You are not so honest as to be trusted
vpon your bare worde,Ra. and therfore
name vnto vs your witnesses which may
depose for you, that the Popes haue euer
vttered wordes with such Arrogancie.
               And you referre vs to the Glose De Maioritate
& Obedientia, vnam Sanctam. But
what saith that Glose? Doth it tel of any
one Pope by name, Or doth it report so
much of the order and succession of them,
that euery one of them, hath in his course
and for his time,Iewel. 
                  
                     
                        •
                     ounded it out into al the
world, that, I can do, what so euer Christ
him selfe can do, &c?
               
               You wil Answer (because there is
no other shift) that the Gloser speaketh
such words of the Pope, not that y• Pope

himself, doth speak them, in his own person
of him selfe. Why then, I Iudge you
by your own words, that you haue made
an open lye, in attributing that, vnto the
Popes owne Act, which is not his▪ but y•
Glosers collection vpō the Canon law.
               Then, further I say, that many

to that which Christ gaue to S. Peter
& his Successors▪ yet doth it not agree
that the Pope should in the first person
crake or sound out of himselfe, I can doe
whatsoeuer Christ himselfe can doe.
For whereas high dignitie & Autoritie is
geuen vnto men, for others sake which
are to be gouerned, & not for their owne
which beare the Office, and whereas such
Gifts & Graces fo gouernemēt make not

                  sse of an Office, may wel become
a wise and worshipful man, so that
he attribute nothing therof vnto himself
as he is one singular person: if the Pope
Concerning his Office do confesse it that
the chiefe Bishoppe in the Church, must
rule al Christians and be subiect to none
of them al: M. Iewel must not therefore
slaunder him, that he openeth his mouth
a wide, and vttereth blaspemies and soundeth
out these wordes into al the world: I
may iudge al mē, but al the world may not
Iudge me. But by such forme of speach
the simple Reader, and common Protestant,
cōceiueth of the Pope, that he standeth
a tipp toe: And ouerlooketh al the
world: And is in great loue and conceipt
of him selfe: And respecteth alwayes
his priuate Estimation: And forgetteth
that there is a God and right Iudge, and
that him selfe is a Man and a Sinner as
other folkes are: and that he attributeth
an Omnipotencie to his owne proper
person, &c. Wherevpon, he taketh an
Indignation, and accompteth him to be
a very Beast or Diuel and no man, that

so preferreth him selfe before other men,
And is ready to accurse, and detest, and
reuile, and speake, and iudge the worst y•
he can of the Pope.
               And this is one of the vile and wicked
kindes of Rhetorique, that is vsed

vpon the Apostles, and saied, take ye the
holy ghost, whose sinnes ye forgeue, they
be forgeuen, whose sinnes ye retaine, they
be retained, he that wil finde any faulte,
must not be angry wt the Apostles which
take the Grace, but with the Author and

doth abhorre to heare these woordes spoken. Now then

by the expresse text of the law,Let M. Iew answer, or geue ouer what saith
the Glose therevpon? Doth it folow the
text or no? If it do not: Remember then
(I praie you M. Iewel) your charitable
and affectuous wordes to D. Harding:
O M. Harding, It is an old saying: Maledicta
Glosa quae corrumpit textum. Accursed be
that Glosing construction, or Glose that
corruppteth the text. Remēber wel this
old saying, & forget not yourselfe, which
bring furth with so great a confidence, a
Glose that impugneth the text.
               But doth the Glose folow the text?
If it do, be ashamed man then of yourself.
which doe so Certainely warrant it, that
the very Glose putteth this mater out of
doubt (that the See of Rome maie erre
in Faith) the text it selfe making to the
contrarie.
               But of this, perchaunce, you haue
litle rega
                     •
                  de, how the Glose agreeth or

to take it, hauing a simple and
plaine eye, neither loking to that which
goeth before, nor that which foloweth,
neither that which is of any side of you.

it is the Pope maie erre, that is inough for
y

                  u, and that, putteth the mater vtterly

you woulde neuer haue broughte this

For more Examples I am not careful,
And more might be foūd, if I would
take the paines to seeke. But I would
wish the learned in the Law, to examine
and consider right wel, M. Iewels testimonies
out of the Lawe. They shal
speake with more Grace, as speaking of
thinges in which they are practised, and
with more facilitie, they shal discouer M.
Iewels vnskilfulnes, as knowing at the
first sight, wherein and when the Lawes
of Gloses are abused. And if nothing
els were, the common Ennemie to al
Trueth, should be conuicted by the expert
in euery Facultie.
            
            
               How M. Iewel abuseth the Constitutions
of the Ciuile Law.
               YF the Canon law be, at these daies,
of so litle price emong Heretiques,
that, for spite they haue to y• Pope,
and the Clergie, they care not how they
misreporte it and disorder it: of the Cō
                  stitutions
yet of Temporal Princes, they
should haue some more reguard, least

whiles they be manifeslly proued to vse
their accustomed libertie, of alleaging or
interpreting the textes also of the Ciuile
law, thei care not with how litle truth or
honesty, they should be rightly cōuinced
to haue neither Spiritual nor Temporal
law for them selues. Now, whether
M. Iewel he as bolde with Constitutions
of Princes, as Decrees of Popes, I
wil bring in his owne woordes as they
lie, and conferre them with the Constitution,
vpon which he groundeth them.
Thus he saith.
               If onely the negligence of the People
haue enforced Priuate Masse,Iew. 17. Auth. Collat.

came it into Colleges, Monasteries, Cathedral
churches, yea (marke now indifferent
Reader, how cōstantly he speaketh)
euen into the very holy church of Rome,
whereas be such numbers of Clerkes, Vicars,
Monkes, Priestes, and Prebendaries,
that the Emperour Iustinian was faine to
stay the encrease of them, al Idle, al in studie
and cōtemplation, al void from worldly
cares, al confessed, al in cleane life, al
prepared?
               I trust,Ra. after so great a vomit, your
Stomak be somwhat better at case. And

first cōcerning y• question it selfe, D. Har.
hath it not, y• 
                  only ye neligēce of ye people,
hath enforced priuat Masse, but
yt oft times ye Priest at Masse hath no
cōpartners to receiue wt him, it proce
deth of lak of deuotiō of ye peples part.
And so hath it somtimes come of lacke of
deuotiō, y• religious mē haue not receued
so oft as they might. And if this doth cō
                  fort
your hart, y• I graūt vnto you, faults
to haue ben foūd emōg religious persōs,
I cannot let you of your own wil, but I
wōder at your fausie, to feed vpō carren.
               Somtimes therfore, y• Priest receiueth
alone, because none is ready to be his cō
                  parteuer,
& sois his Sole receiuing or as
M. Iew. would say, his priuat Masse, not
enforced but occasioned therby. For yt lak
of deuoriō or diligence in y• people is not
an Essential,

                  ,
& it doth not make y• Sole receiuing,
but is made rather therof. For, to speake
proprety 
                     〈◊〉
                   orderly, if I were asked what

                     〈◊〉
                   y• cause, why the Priest receiueth alone
I would answer: The Caufe is, y• he is

not boūd to haue company, and yt he hath
a godly desire to celebrate & receiue, and yt
the celebrating of ye Mysteries & enioying
of them, depēdeth not vpō the mutabilitie
of ye peoples minde but vpon cō
                  mission,
power authoritie, grace, & effects,
yt Christe hath indued his Priestes & his
Sacramēts wtal. And this much concerning
M. Iewels Obiection, least any
should be troubled with it.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   Now to ye
cōstitution of Iustinian. First M. Iew.
would haue it conceiued yt Themperour
should find fault wt the numbers of Clerkes,
&c. in his time, because of some disorder
or misbehauiour emong them, & to
to this purpose, he thrusteth into his sentence,
by a certain figure of lying & mocking,
Al Idle, al in studie & cōtemplacion,
al void from worldly cares &c.
               
               Then would he haue it to be cōceiued
yt either there were that wēt about to redresse
this geare & could not preuail, or y•
in dede neither Pope, nor Cardinal, nor
Bishop cared for it, so yt the Emperor Iustinian
was fain to stai the encrease of them.
Thirdly, he so speaketh as though Vicars
Monkes and Prebendaries were noted in
the Coustitution.
               
                  Last of al, which is chiefly to be marked,
he is so bold as to say it, that Iustinian
should be fain to staie the encrease of
Clerkes, &c. ye euen in the holy Church▪
of Rome, where, &c As though the Emperour
had ben so loftie, as to take vpon
himselfe the office of the Pope, and in the
Churches, which are specially vnder
the gouernement of the B. of Rome.
               Concerning therefore the first & second
of these pointes, it is manifest in ye
Constitution, yt the cause of staying the
number of Clerkes in Constantinople, &
therabout, was not for ani such misliking
as heretikes haue now with the number
of Priestes which are not al of ye best, but
only because the Reuenewes of ye church
in Constantinople were not able wel to
find them. And therfore (how much the
Spiritual Rulers did thinke of ye mater,

                     〈◊〉
                   can tel, but) the Emperour, for the honour
of the Clergie, and not for cōtempe
of the Degree, wrote vnto Epiphanius,
the Archebishop of Cōstantinople about
this mater, & no doubt but with his aduise
and cōsent, appointed yt order which
should be taken. Which was this, that as

many as already, had alowāce or liuing
in ye great Church or other of Constantinople,
should haue it still, but that from
thencefurth, no more should be found of
the Church, than answered the iust number
of the persons, which by the foundation
of the Churches had portions and
stipendes to mainteine them.
               To the third point then I answer,
yt Iustinian speaketh not of Vicars, Monkes
and Prebendaries, and that herein
M. Iewel shewed a point of an heretical

                     〈◊〉
                   pite, to geaue such names to the persons
whom the Emperour should seeme
to bring vnder his lawe, as are at these
daies most odious, and to moue suspicion
to his Reader, that the number of
Monkes were euen in Iustinians tyme
abhorred. Which is so false, as it is true,
that in al tha
                     •
                   Constitution, there is no
mention of Monke or Religious person
but only of such as serued in the Cathedrall
Church, and other of Constantinople,
or the quarters there about.
               And by this, it doth wel appeere, that
it is to to impudently said (touching the
fourth point) Iustinians Constitution

for staieing the increase of the number of
Clerkes &c  should be made, yea, euen
for the very holy Church of Rome. For
it is directed only to Epiphanius. Archbishope
of Constantinople, and all the
constitution, through, he maketh mentiō
only, Huius Regia Civitatis; of this princely
Citie. meaning Constantinople, and
especially, of the greate Churche there.
Of which, he hath suche care, and for
which, he taketh such a Special order,
that he apointeth, how many Priestes,
Deacons, and Subdeacons &c. it should
haue, and not aboue. As three skore
a hundred Deacons,
                  What should al 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   
                  and Women fortie
(which were not, you may be sure their
Wyues, excepte two men and an halfe
should haue gone to one) Subdeacons nynetie, Readers a hundred and ten, Singers fiue and
twentie: so that al the number of the most Reuerende Clerkes of the most holy Great Church
shal consist in foure hundred twenty and fiue, besides and aboue a hundred of them which are called O
                        ••
                     arij that is, Porters.
               So many then, Iustinian aloweth
to the number of one Church in Constantinople,

for all his staie made, that
Clerkes should not encrease. And that▪
because that one Church was wel hable
to find so manie, without borowing of
others or laying to pleage of their owne.
                     
                        〈…〉

                     •
                   it againe M. Iewel, he doth not

               With what Face then and Conscience
referre you this Constitution to
the Church of Rome? And in so greait
a mater, as the Supremacie is, wherefore
abuse you the Authoritie of the Emperour,

call the Churche of Rome, Holy,
feared not yet to made a Lawe, that it
should not haue aboue a certaine number
of Uicars, Monkes, and Prebendaries,
of which it would folowe by likelyhood,
that the Emperour tooke him
selfe for a worthier Head of the Church,
than the Pope.

and fasshion, as M. Iewel vseth) and
saie,Iew. 172. 
                  It is commonly said, vbilex non distinguit,

ought we to make no distinction. And
therefore awaie with this Sophisticall
distinction, of lawful and vnlawful killing,
and goe to the Text it selfe, whiche
saith expressely: Theu shalt not kil. And so
by this meane which M. Iewel foloweth,
an Heretike might be lousie by
Authoritie, nor only of the Law of God,
but the Rule of man: except he would be
so merciful as not to kil the vermyne,
but, by some other waie put them awaie

                   I wil reherse y•
one most sensible case, which the law
                     •
                  ers
thē selues do put to proue, that y• foresaid
rules which you haue put furth for general,
must he limited.
               Suppose, y• there is an act or law made
by the prince, y• 
                  whosoeuer stryketh A
man within his court, and maketh
him bleede, shal leese his head, or his
hand for it. Here, the law is general, in
saying whosoeuer, without exception of
persons,What thus heth M. Iew▪ in this case? & therfore (as M. Iewel would
haue it some) it must be taken Generally.
It chaunceth then after this, y• some of y•
priuy Chāber lieth sick of a pleurisy. And

the Phisitiō being at hand, he counseleth
y• party to be let bloud. And this being y•
most presēt remedy: the Bargar cūmeth,
stretcheth the vaine, maketh the Gentleman
bleed, and loketh for a good reward:
I aske thē whether the Barbar shal leese
his head or his hand for his labor? And
who seeth not, that no? Yet the law was
general that whosoeuer strecheth &c. yea
but the Rule is not general, that, the
thing that is generally spoken, must be takē
generally. For where y• cōmon wealth
should take hurte by it, if the lawe were
vnderstanded generally (as in the case of
the Barbar, it is not for the cōmon wealthes
profite, that he an Innocent should
leese either life or lymme) there must be
vsed necessarily one Restriction (at the
least) of the lawes Generalitie.
               Wherefore then doth M. Iewel, so
lyke dodger,dodger come in with such Rules,
as deceaue the simple Reader, and fil his
papers to no purpose? Wherefore maketh
he Obiections which he knoweth
to haue casie answer? Or why hath he no
care by what meanes he bringeth his
maters, to passe, so that for the present,

he say somewhat to his Aduersarie.
               Upon confidence of these general Rules,
which at the first feeme reasonable, he carieth
the Readers away with him, into
blinde knowledge, maineteyning his
owne heresies and their errours, by the
superficial wordes of the Ciuile Law, either
not atteiuing to the sense thereof, Or
quite leauing it. And this wil I proue
by a manifest example, so much the more willingly,
because I shal haue in the end
a further Occasion, to shew an other limitation
vnto this rule which M. Iewel
would haue to be taken Generally.

               Wel▪ here is some cause why he should
fauour the Citie of Constantinople,Ra. but
what is this to Rome? It foloweth.
               For like Consideration the Emperour
gaue out this special Priuilege (vpō which
D,
                  Iew. 
                  Harding groundeth his Argument)
in fauour of the See of Rome.

                  nted,Ra. that he fauoured
Rome as wel as Cōstantinople.
But what reason can ye shew, wherefore
h

                   should prefer it vefore Cōstantinople,

                  t Rome in the first degree & place,
and Constantinople in the next? For by
al likelyhod. Constantinople being the
place where he kept his court & to which

most resorte was made, concerning maters
of the Empire, if the geuing of Prinilegies
vnto See and Bishops had depēded
of his fauour only, he would haue
honored first of al, the Patriarche of his
Chief and Imperial Citie.
               But is it not a manifest lie,Note the Lie. that the
Emperour gaue the Chiefdom to the B.
of Rome vpon a special inclinatiō which
he had to y• Citie? Consider the wordes
of his Edice. What are they? Vve Ordein

                     o the determination
of the Canōs, that the Pope of Rome
be Chief of al Priesetes. He folowed then, the
Law of the first foure general Councels,
& not his own Inclinatiō. And he honored
y• See of Rome with his Edict, not
because he fauored Rome in his special a

former Coūcels which he regarded as y•
Scriptures themselues, & as inuiolable
lawes, had so decreed & determined, y• the
B. of Rome, should be Primus, First or Chief
of al Priestes. How impudētly then doth
M. Iew. abuse y• Emperors edict, by making
y• to be y• chief cause therof, which in
dede was not the cause? But let him go
forward.
               
                  
And by the way least any errour happen
to grow of this woorde Papa,Iew. To what purpose? it behoueth
thee. Good Reader, to vnderstand,
that Papa in olde times, in the Grek tong,
signified a Father &c. And further in S.
Augustines time & before, the same name
was geuen generally to al Bishopes, &c.
               You say truely,Ra. and you proue it excedingly,
and if ye would be rather called
Pope Iewel, then Bishope Iewel, be it
at your owne choyse, and your friendes
most wise. But returnem, I pray you,
againe into the way, and Aunswere the
Edict of Iustinian.
               But to returne to the mater.Iewel, Feare, where no cause is shewed. M. Harding
may not of euery thing that he readeth,
conclude what he listeth.
               If he doe. you can with fewer Circumstancies
tel him of it.Ra. But Primus

                        •
                     mnium Sacerdotum▪
                   is in English the First
and Chiefe of al Priestes. And he which
hath so much geuen vnto him, by General
Councels of the Primitue church, he
is higher (I trow) then any of his Felowes.
And therefore it is much looked
for, that you should Answere directly
to the Priuilege.
               This Priuilege graunted vnto theIew. Bisshop

of Rome, to be the First of al Priestes
was not to beare the whole sway, and to ouer
rule al the world.
               Ye speake like a man that were offended
with tyranny,Ra. and ye speake of ouer
ruling. But we thinke not, that, as

and other diuine felowes inough,
aboute him, then he beginnneth to ouer
rule and ouer run the Countrie, by spoiling
of Churches, killing of Religious
persons, rauishing of holy Uirgins, and
doing of other feates of your Gospel: so
the Pope may set and let, pul in, plucke
out, kil and saue, and do what him listeth
vpon a Furie or Brauerie: but that power
onely we require to be geauen him,
which they acknowleged, that determined
him to be First or Chiefe of al Priestes.
               
               And we aske you, of his Power that he
hath to rule ouer al the world, and not of
ouer rule al the world. For although y•
places, to which his I
                     •
                  risdiction extendeth
it selfe, are not limited, yet his power
to rule them is limited: and he that

                  ouer ruleth any one Countrie, be it neuer
so much his owne, doth more then he
ought to do, by that which is ouer measure
and Rule. Leauing therfore to presse
vs wt your odious & slaūdcrous termes,
as though any Catholike were of y• opinion,
y• the Pope might or should play y•
part of a Tyran, & care for no law nor reson,
but ouer rule al the world, and beare
the whole sway in the world, Answer to y•
Authoritie of Iustiniaus Edict, & shew
wherin was the Priuilege graunted vnto
the Bishope of Rome. It was not
(you say) to ouer rule al the world.
               
               But onely in General meetinges,Iewe

and order them in their doinges.
               How proue you this? And remember,Ra.
that you must proue, that the
Priuilege graunted vnto the Bishope of
Rome was to sitte onely aboue others.

both in your Booke which is wel printed,
and in the Code of Parise printe,
where they may be readen without spectacles,
except a mans sight be very yll.
But dare you say, that this place perteineth
to the Bishoppe of Rome? For of
the Bishoppe of Rome our question is,
whether his Priuilege to be First and
Chiefe of al Priestes, consisted onely
in sitting aboue other, in Generall
meetinges. I wil tel thee (Indiffetent
Reader) the Sense of these foresaid
woordes, and the Cause of making the
Decree in which thei are found, that thou
maist iudge whether M. Iewel be a fine
and vpright Lawyer.

The Emperour here vpon made a Law,
after the Countrie was diliuered of the
Tyranny, that, those thinges being abroga

done against the true Religion of God,

               And I beseech thee also,Ra. Gendtle Reader,
to weigh them wel.
               It foloweth Immediatly.Iew. We ordeine
that the most holy Archebishope of Iustiniana
the first whiche is in our Countrie,
shal haue for euer vnder his iurisdictiō the
Bishops of the prouinces of Dacia, Dania,
&c. and that he, in the prouinces subiect
vnto hym, shal haue the place of the Apostolkie
See of Rome.
               But what of this▪
                  Ra.
               
               
                  
Here we see,Iew. the Bishoppe of Iustiniana
sette in as high Authoritie, and power
within his own lurisdiction, as the B.
of Rome within his.
               But by whome was he sette in so
high Authoritie? By the Emperour?
And who gaue the Emperour such power?
Or was he so priuileged by the
Pope? Yea surely by the Pope, if any
Authoritie were lawfully taken and exercised.
But so much doth not appeere
by the Decree. Yes verely doth it. But
M. Iewel taketh his vantage, and mangleth
Decree
                     •
                   at his pleasure. For thus
it foloweth in the lawe▪ that the Bishope

               Set then, if the Bishope of Iustiniana,
for al that the Emperor honoured
that Con
                     •
                  trie so much, if he receaued so
greate Authoritie from the Pope: how

                     •
                  uch was the Pope aboue him, y• gaue
him y• authoritie▪ Could y• Pope, subiect
vnto a newe Bishope the Proiunces of

                  Dacia, Dania, Dardania, Misia, and Pannonia?
Or exempt him from the Iurisdiction
of his Metropolitan, or primitiue, except
in dede his authoritie had ben vniuersal?
Yet such priuileges gaue the Pope vnto
the B. of Iustiniana, and the Emperour
was not the doer in it, but y• Executour
only of the Popes determination.
               Note also and see (M. Iewel) that
it is not in this decree, that the B. of Iustiniana,
shal haue within his owne Iurisdiction,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  as high authoritie as the Bishop
of Rome within his, there is no such comparison
made, but only that he shal haue
within his Iurisdiction, the place of the
Apostolike See of Rome. And so haue many
of the Popes Legates, in the prouincies
vnto which they be directed, but
none was euer yet so folish, as to gather
hereof, y• the Pope therefore cā do no more
than his Legate. For as y• is true, in such
cases as the Pope permitteth vnto y• Legates
ordinance: so absolutely it is most
false, because the Pope may when he wil
depose his Legate, or abbridge his Autority,
or send an other to gouern with
him, but no such thing may be exequu
                  
                     •••
                  
against the Pope.
               
                  
If therefore the B. of Iustiniana do
neuer so muche enioye the Priuilegies
graunted vnto him by the B. of Rome,
let him take them as Priuileges, not as
Canons: Let him acknowledge himself
to supplie the Place of the Bisshoppe of
Rome within his owne Prouincies, and
not to sit, as it were, in his owne proper
and ordinarie Place: Let him geue place
to the B. of Rome, if he should personally
come within his Iurisdiction, and
let him not crake of it, that he hath as
high Authoritie within his Iurisdiction, as
the B. of Rome within his. For if he doe,
Uigilius the Pope that gaue him such
prerogatiue, may pull it away agayne
from him, And M. Iewels argument
shalbe vtterly dasshed, that thinketh, the
Priuilege of the Apostolike See, graunted
to any particular Bisshoppe ouer his
country, to derogate from the Authority
of the Apostolike See which is in Rome,
And whiche hath Iurisdiction ouer all
Bisshoppes in Christendome.
               Nowe one place more, and so we
shall end this Chapiter. M. Iewel goeth
further and sayeth.
               
                  
In lyke sorte, the Emperour Iustinian
saieth:Iew. 242 Ecclesia vrbis Constantinopolitanae
Romae veteris praerogatiua laetatur. The
Church of the Citie of Constantinople, enioyeth
now the prerogatiue of Rome the
Elder.
               Let me be answered then in one question.
You said,Ra. not twenty lines before,
that the prerogatiue of the Bishoppe of
Rome censisted only in sitting in the
first place,How can it be Answered? at general meetings. If therefore
the B. of Constantinople haue the
same Preuogatiue that the B. of Rome,
who shal sit first I praie you? Or shal they
sit one in an others lap? Or, shal one of
them stand whiles the othersitteth? Or
shal the prerogatiue of the B. of Rome be
interpreted, to signifie some other thing
byside the sitting only in the first place?
               For, if the prerogatiue, of the Pope be
to sit only first, and if the B. of Constantinople
haue the like prerogatiue as the
B. of Rome, he must likewise sit first: Ergo,
Iustinians Constitution, that the B.
of Constantinople, should sit in the secōd
place, is void. Ergo M. Iewel by one
law (through his blind interpretation)
d
                     •
                  th destroy an other. Surely this alone

doth proue sufficiētly, that you huddle vp
Constitutions one vppon an other, to
make a shew only of great learning, and
not because either you vnderstand the
law, Or speake after it, or seeke to make
the trueth plaine and euident.
               But let vs consider the place it selfe.
The Church (you saie) of Constantinople
enioyeth the priuilege of the Elder Rome.
But what priuilege is that? To Rule the
whole world? To cal general Councels?
To Confirme them? To disproue them?
To increase the Iurisdiction of Bishops
or Patriarches, and to diminish it againe
as it shal be profitable for the Church of
Christ?
               The B. of Rome, is hable to geaue
vnto any B. in al the world, as great precogatiue
ouer his diocese, as himself hath
ouer Italie, like as Uigilius the Pope
gaue to the B. of Iustiniana: but is any
Archebishope in al y• world hable to geue
an other, either the Prerogatiue of the
Church of Rome, either the Prerogatiue
which himselfe 
                     •
                  ath from the Church of
Rome, without asking of leaue of y• B. of
Rome? No surely, the Effect can not

worke vpward towardes the cause, or
worke so excellently douneward, as the
cause: neither the Bisshops of Constantinople
or Iustiniana, taking their Prerogatiues
from Rome, can endue others
with like Priuileges, without consent of
the Bishop of Rome.
               Therefore, although the Bisshop of
Constantinople hath the Prerogatiue of
the Litie of Rome, it foloweth not, that
the Bisshop of Rome is nothing superiour
to the Bishop of Constantinople.
And if y• Lord President in Wales should
haue geauen vnto him all the Prerogatines
of the Kings Court in England, it
foloweth not, that the King and he are
Hayle felowes wel mette for euer after.
And Christ our Sauiour although he said
vnto his Apostles As my father sent me so
I send yow, geauing thereby vnto them
as greate Prerogatiue as himselfe had,
yet he meant not, that y• Apostles should
think themselues as good as their head,
euen in those thinges which they should
doe as wel as Christ.
               M. Iewel therefore doth very unteasonably
conceiue of the Law, that the

Popes Supremacie was not acknowledged,
because, the Communicating of
his Prerogatiue with some other Bisshops,
is found expressed in the Law.
               But it wil be replied, that Generaliter
dictum generaliter est accipiendum,
The thing that is spoken generally must be
taken Generally. I answer: this Rule
fayleth, when by other expressed texte of
the Law, that which seemeth to be spokē
Generally in one place, is restricted &
limited in an other. For in the next title
before this of which we speak, the Emperour
sayth to y• B. of Rome. Omnes Sacerdotes,

that anything, vvhich perteineth to

not also come to the knovvledge of your Holines,
Quae Caput est omnium Sanctarum Ecclesiarum,
Vvhich is the Head of al boly Churches.
               
               
                  
Let the Bishope then of Constantinople
enioy the Prerogatiue of the Citie
of Rome, in as large and General sense
as M. Iewel wil, yet this must be prouided
for, first of al, that the Prerogatiue
which the B. of Constantinople shal enioye,
doe not contrary the former law,
which Subiecteth al Priestes of the vvest vnto
his holynes, And which confesseth him to be
head ouer al Churches.
               
               Thus haue I sufficiently and manifestly
proued, that M. Iewel hath abnsed
the Canon Law. The Lawiers
themselues haue more to say vnto him
for his impudencie, if he be so impudent
as euer to shew his face before them.
               And nowe to the Olde Fathers, and
Doctoures.
            
            
               How M. Iewel hath abused the
Auncient Fathers.
               IT is incredible, how M. Iewel hath
abused the Doctours. Incredible (I
meane) not, in respect of Protestantes
which thinke so wel of him, that they beleue

no oue euident vntruth to be within
all his Replye: but of Catholikes,
which knowing the cause that he defendeth,
to be vtterly false, may iustly suspect
euery Witnesse, that he bringeth in
for his Doctrine, And which hauing already
taken him in manifest corrupting
of Witnesses, cannot but know him for
one that loketh suspitiously, whē so euer
he is about Auncient Fathers. Yet (I assure
thee▪ Indifferent Reader) the Catholikes
themselues did not thinke, that
any man would so haue corrupted true
Sentences, as he hath done: Or so ofre
haue folowed such vnlawful craftes, as
are not once to be vsed of honest men.
               But these, you will say, are but
wordes: let us therefore come, to the
thinges themselues. And first, concerning
such Illations of M. Iewels, as he
vseth in geuing of the cause or proufe of
his sayinges, He applieth thereto, the
Testimonies of Auncient Fathers, so
loosely and so disagreeably, as if a man
would saie: The Waters of Bath are

                     〈◊〉

I wil choose but our place, in which, for

Auncient Doctours togeather, Of all
which there is not one that serueth his

By these wordes then it is manifest,
what is, Original, Head, and Doctrine
of our heauenly Maister, that is, to the forsaking
of which, Sainct Cyprian imputeth
the Proceedinges of the Diuel,
and of Heresies. Uerely no other, than
that, which our Sauiour by the foresaid
expresse Scriptures, gaue to S. Peter.
               But now, heere ariseth a grea
                     ••
                  
doubt and question, that S. Peter can
not wel be the Heade, because euery one
of the Apostles, was as great in Power
as he. And this in deede is the Argument,
that M. Iewel maketh, out of S.
Cyprian, against the Supremacie.
               Which if Sainct Cyprian hadde not espied
and Answered,Note vn
                     
                        •
                     easarable foule dealing then should M. Iewel
easily be pardoned: But now, what
an intolerable kinde of soule dealing is
this, to take an Obiection out of an
Olde Father, and either for Hast. Or
Negligence, Or Craftines, Or Desperatnes,
to let go the right answer vnto it?
               For, concerning the Obiection,
Sainct Cyprian thus withstandeth it,
saiyng: And although he gaue after his resurrection,
lyke povver vnto al his Apostles, &c.

yet to declare vnitie, he desposed by his Authority,
the Original of the same vnitie, begining of one.
By the Obiection then it scemeth, that
no more accompt should be made of S.
Peter, then of the vest of the Apostles,
which seuerally was as greate in power
as he: But by the Aunswere, made
with this Aduersatiue Tamen, Yet, it is
manifest, that, notwithstanding the equa
litie among y• Apostles, S. Peter yet was
y• First and the Head among them. For
Christ disposed by his Authoritie (saith
S. Cyprian) the Original not of vnitie (as
you mangle it M. Iewel) but,Ys not this mangling of sentēces: 
                  of the same
vnitie (which vndoubtedly was in the
Apostles) beginning of one, which is S.
Peter.
               As in the Sentence folowing, more
manifestly appeereth, to the further opening
of S. Cyprians right meaning, and
your false dealing. For the one halfe
of the Sentence is this: in deede the rest
also of the Apostles vvere the same that Peter
vvas: endevved with like fellovvship, honour,
and povver: This half M. Iewel you rest
vpon, and build your Conclusion, that
one of them had no more Priuilege than

an other.Clipping of Sentences. And why interpreted you
no further; Is the sentence or Sense,
(thinke you) at an ende, when you haue
your purpose? Doth not S. Cyprian Interpret,
Correct, Amend, or Determine it
with an Adnersatiue yet, saying (least any
mā should through his former words
set lesse by S. Peter or his Chaire) But
yet the Original commeth from v
                        •
                     itie, that the
Church may be shevved to be one? And what
other thing is this to say, but that, notwithstanding
it to be true, that the Apostles
were endewed with like honour &
power as S. Peter was, yet no manne
ought to gather heereof, that there was
no Order among them, Or that one Bishope
now hath as large and absolute
Authoritie as an other. But this rather
must folowe, that because schismes
and Heresies doe grow apase, vvhere no
Original or Head is sought for or regarded, And
because it should be perceiued, that the
Church is One, in that it cōsisteth of one
Head, vnto whome al the rest, were they
neuer so high or felow like, must be refer
red: therefore Christ, by his Authoritie, disposed
the Original of that vnitie, 
                  
                     •
                   endewed

S. Peter with a singular Prerogatiue,
that he shoulde be that One in the
Church, from whom whosoeuer departed,
should not be of the Church.
               And note wel the Cause, why the
beginning must rise of One, vt Ecclesia vna
monstretur, that the Church might be shevved to
be one.
                  The vnitie of the Church, i
                        •
                      proued by the one Head ther of. Why; Should it not be One,
though in euery Diocese, through the
world, euery seueral Bishop were Chief
therein; No surely, by S. Cyprian, it
should not be. But, in that the Head therof
is but one, the vnitie of her doth folow
necessarily. How doth it folow; Mary,
Whosoeuer holdeth not with this Head,
he is not in the Church, and so must none
remaine within her, but the Catholike &
obediēt Christians. How cā they but agree
then al in one Head, if they mind to
cōtinue in y• Church, wheras y• departure
from h
                     •
                  m, is to take an other Church, bisides
that, whose special marke is Vnitie in
one Head. This conclusion then standing,
that S. Peter was set, by the Autoritie
of Christ,Simple cōclusions in the first place, was that
no special Priuilege, trow you? Or was
he First, to that intent ōly, that in reckening
vp the Apostles, men should know

where to begin? Or, that in their meetings
together, he should sitte first? Or
speake first? Or subscribe first? How
simple things are these for the wisedome
of God to think of? And how litle auailable
to the preseruing of the Churche in
Unitie, if no further Preeminence were
geuen him?
               And againe, if the B. of Romes authoritie
now, as S. Peters was then,
were of no more force, yet beeing of so
much, if other would sit before him, Or
speake before him in any Councel, should
they not be Offenders against the ordinance
of God? How can it be otherwise,
whereas he appointed by his Authoritie
the Original of Vnitie to begin of One? Suppose
then, that some one transgresseth this order,
who shal reproue him? If none,
how vnreasonable is it, to set a law, and
not to include therby an authority to punish
the transgressor of the Law? If any:
who more worthy of that Office then the
Chief Bishope? Ergo there was in S.
Peter,The Priuilege of S. Peter must be more then to sitte or 
                        〈◊〉
                      first. a proper Authoritie ioyned to

Ie. graūteth vnto him) by which he had
power to cōtroll them, y• should or wold

no other of the Apostles had. Except
ye wil be so mad as to thinke, that in cō
                  trolling
of a fault committed against any
Excellent Person, his Inferiour should
be Iudge in the mater, and bind or loose
at his wil or discretion.
               I leaue it therefore as most manifest,
that notwithstanding the Apostles
were equal in felowshipp of honour and
power▪ with S. Peter, yet the Original of

                        〈◊〉
                     
                   was appointed by our Saluiour
himselfe, to begin of S. Peter only, and
none other. And this his preeminence
(make you it as litle as you can) requiring
A Proportional Authoritie to be
graunted vnto him, for the defense therof
against al disdaine or disobedience that
might be procured or vsed against it: he
had, without al doubt, some Prerogatiue
of Iurisdiction aboue any other, and
by Consequence some more power, then
the rest of the Apostles bad.
               And this I speak with the least, because

our Aduersaries be contentious,
knowing in dede, y• if I would presse thē
further with this Testimonie of S. Cyprian,
they could not honestly denie, but
such a wisdome of God, and prerogatiue
of S. Peter was expressed, in erecting
one Head and beginning, as should keepe
the Church in vnitie, And be a sure and
certaine way for al them to take, whiche
liue in danger of heresies. Which can not
be so meane a thing, as to sit first only in
a place, or speake only before other, without
further superioritie aboue other: but
enough is alreadie said, both to de clare y•
trueth of S. Cyprians words, & the falsehoode
of M. Iewel in abusing them.

Iewel,Absurdities folowing vpō M Tewels sense. hath euery good and Faithfull
Christian in the world, as great & as special
authoritie as S. Peter? If it be so:
how doth S. Paule say, that, God hath apointed
in his Church first Apostles, then Euangelistes,
Thirly doctours &c.
                  1.Cor.12. How saith he in
an other place, that, Christ hath geauen to his
Church some to be Apostles, some Prophetes, other
Euangelistes, and other to be Pasteurs and Doctours.
Or how is not the Subdeacon asEph. 4.
great in authoritie as the Priest, and the
Priest as the Archebishope? Yea the common
laie men or women stedfastly confessing
Christ, how haue not they, y• Reies
of y• kingdome of heauen in their hands,
euen as the Apostles or S. Peter himself
had? For Origene pronounceth without
exception, that, to haue the keies of the
kingdome of heauen, is promised to al
that haue it reueled vnto them, that Christ

                      the Sonne of the Liuing God.
               
               If therefore this sense can not stand, we
must▪ of necessitie seke an other. And consider
in what sort Origen saith, the keies
of the kingedome of heauen to be geuen,
not only to S. Peter, but to the rest also
of good & godly men. But nothing more
easy to be found. For Origen y• place

(as his maner is) gathereth a mystical or
moral sense of the literal and plaint historie:

applying it to edificati

                  . Like as
                     •
                  . Paul,
writing vnto the Galathians, & declaring
vnto thē, y• the two sonnes of Abraham,
the one borne of Agar y• seruant,Gala. 4. the other
of Sara the free womā, signified the two
Testamentes: meant not to make vs beleue,
that there was not such a man, as
Abraham is described to haue ben, or that
such real and corporal promises were not
made vnto him, as the Scriptures doe
testifie, but out of the Literal historie, he
gathereth a mystical sense, knowing that
vnto the Fathers of the old law, al things
chaunced in figures,1. Cor.10 the Trueth of which
is reueled by Christ vnto his Church.
               
                  Now, that Origen doth so as I do say,
it is plaine by his owne words. For after

that S. Peter had no greater Priuilege
than any other, because, after a spiritual
vnderstanding, it is said vnto euery one
that confesseth Christ accordingly, Thou
art Peter. After which rate, our Ladie only,

And the Correction, due and ready for

               And therefore vndoubtedly, if you wil
haue this place vnderstanded particularly
of euery Bishope, and saie, that God
hath geauen eche of them, ful power: the
practise not only of al Christendome, but
of your owne congregation, wil confute
you, In which there is difference betwen
the Superintendent of Sarum and of
Canterburie. But, if you wil refer the
gift of ful power, vnto some singular successours
of the Apostles, then is this text
nothing preiudicial, to the Supremacie of
the Bishope of Rome, in whom alone,
when ful power resteth, the saying of S.
Cyril may be verified. For what they
haue, it is true to say, that the Apostles
successours haue it.
               And this alone were inough to answer:
But now I say further, That S.
Cyril hath not as you report. For in repeting
shortly the Spiritual sense, which
was to be gathered out of those two actes
of Christ, the one, when he passed ouer

the See of Tyberias (signifying therby,
the forsaking of the Iewes) and wente
vp againe into an hil with his disciples:
The other, when he cast vp his eyes, and
beholding a number of people comming
toward him, fedde them to the ful, with
fiue loaues and two fishes, of this miraculous
fact of our Sauiour he saith: Quare,
vetera & noua scripturae mandata, fidelibus

Bishop is higher then an other: S. Cyril

by his ful grace comprehendeth the grace
of preaching only, & instructing of other.
The ful grace which S. Cyril nameth, is
so cōfessed to be in y• Apostles & their successours,
y• yet he signifieth not,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   whether
al should haue it equally, or som be therin
before their fellowes, or whether the
heades of the Church, should apoint the
Preachers (which is nothing cōtrary to
a Supremacie) or euery man vse his gift
before he be licenced, which were altogether
one of order: M. Iew. concludeth of
that ful povver (which he maketh S. Cyril
to speake of) not only y• such a povver was
in the Apostles, & is in their Successors,
but also that it is ful in euery one of their
successours, & that the B. of Rome hath
not y• Supremacie for which his handeling
of y• aūcient Fathers, if he may yet escape
y• note of a Falsifier, then go not the
procedings forward by indifferencie, but
with hatred of the contrary side, & with
euident iniurie. And now foloweth immediatly
the abusing of an other Doctor.

through al Contradictions of the world,
and Aduersities, and Deathes: so should

                  Monast. 
                  vvhen
he appointed Peter to be the Pastor of his Church
after him. What This, be we taught?
               Whether that one Apostle is as good as
an other, or one Bishope as high as an
other, or the Curate of as great Authoritie
as the Person, or the Person of as
large a Iurisdiction as the Bishope?
               No. But that we should be obedient
vnto our Pastours. For thus it foloweth
in S. Basile.
               Quem admodum igitur. &c. Therefore

lyke as Sheepe obey the Sheepeherd, and go vvhat
soeuer vvay he vvil, so they that excercise them
selues in godlines, must obey their Rulers, and
nothing at al serch their commaundementes curiously
vvhen they haue no sinne in them, but cō
                  traryvvise
to accomplish them vvith most readinesse
of minde and diligence. As if he should
shortly haue said:
               
               Christ appointed Peter and other
after him in order to be Sheepherds,
               Ergo Christe appointed such as
were vnder their Charge to be as
Sheepe.
               But Sheepe obey their Shepherd
without making any inquisition vpon
his leading and guiding of them:
               Ergo we be taught obedience by
Christ him selfe, in this also, that he
made Peter y• Pastour of the Church
after him.
               To this ende, by these meanes, S.
Basile bringeth his discourse in the foresaid
Chapiter, which I haue the more at

large opened vnto thee, that thou maist
see (Indifferent Reader) how litle he
intended to speake against the Popes supremacie,
or for the equalitie of Priestes
of Bishopes, that one of them should be
as high as an other.
               What moued then M. Iewel, to vse
S. Basil in this place? Or what words are
they here, by which he cō
                  
                     •
                  irmeth his Assertiō? His Assertion is y•,Iew. 239 
                  the old Catholik
Fathers could neuer vnderstande any such
special Priuilege of binding and loosing, as
M. Hardinges Athanasius attributeth
to the See of Rome? But how proueth
he this?S. Basile for the supremacie. 
                  Christ (saith he out of S. Basil)
appointed Peter to be Pastor of his church
after him. Note then, that Christ is First
and S. Peter Next. And this maketh
directly for the Supremacie. But it foloweth.
               And so consequently gaue the same povver
vnto al Pastours and Doctours.
               Be it so. But what is consequently?
How M. Iewel taketh it, I can not
tel, but 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in greke, which
phrase S. Basile vseth, signifieth the Pastours
that folow in order and row after

S. Peter. Now Order requireth, that although
al be Pastoures, yet they may not
take vpon them, and rule cōfusely al in a
clampe togeather, but euery man in his
place & degree, according vnto y• proportion
of his Flocke and Charge. And therfore
this, hitherto proueth rather that y•
Pope of Rome, is the Chief after Christ,
and that al other what so euer they be, go
not cheeke by cheeke by him, & as worthy
or Supreme as he, but euery man in his
order and degree after him. But this that
foloweth, is perchaunce altogeather for
M. Iewel. what is that? Marie
               A token vvhereof is this, that al Pastours
dooe equally both binde and loose as vvel
as he.
               True it is M. Iewel,Ra▪
                   the most simple
in al the world doth binde and loose,
like as the Pope him selfe. But this
is true, in such thinges, as are permitted
vnto his Iurisdiction. For in some kind
of Faultes, the partie must be referred
vnto the Iudgement of the Bishoppe▪
And in cases of Heresie, Breaking of
Uowes, and Robbing of Churches, the

Bishop hath not in his hands to absolue
the offender, but the whole must be reserued
vnto the Pope. And therefore,
although in such faultes as euery Prior
or Priest may forgeue or retaine, the Iurisdiction,
which he excerciseth, be as effectual,
as if S. Peter himself had absolued
or bound the Parties: yet this is nothing
against the special Priuilegies aboue
al others which are graunted vnto
the See of Rome. As in example of
fiue hundred Capitaines in a Field, Or
fiue hundred Lordes in a Countrie, euery
one commaundeth the Souldier of his
band, or Tenant of his land, and yet this
is not preindicial vnto the worthines &
excellencie of the General Capitaines and
chiefe Lordes.Al that do one thing equally, are not of like Authoritie. The Angels doe al of
them waite and attende vpon God, and
at the later Day, al the Electe shal haue
euery one his penie and reward: yet the
Cherubins are of higher Authoritie than
the inferiour Angels, and the Apostles
shal be in greater Glorie, than Confessours.
What shal we say of Christ him
selfe?Ioan. 20. 
                  As my Father (saith he) sent me, so
(end I you, And vvhen he had said this, he breathed

vpon them, and saith vnto them: Take ye the
holy Ghost. VVhose sinnes you shal forgeaue them,
they are forgeuen them, and vvhose sinnes, ye do
reteine, they be reteined. Here loe, you may
see that he hath made the Apostles equal
with hym. How then? wil you conclude
that Christ is not supreme in his Church,
and that he hath not the authoritie of binding
and loosing in a more high degree
than any of his Apostles? Such yet is
your diuinitie (M. Iewel) that because al
Pastours do equally bind & loose, therefore
the Pope hath no special Priuilege
aboue other. But you lacked the vnderstanding,
that al do equally bind & loose
in such cases and Persons, as are subiected
vnto them, And that, because euery
Bishop can not exercise the power of his
Orders when and where it pleaseth him,
therefore it is euident, that all are not
equal, but that the Superiours may restraine
the Iurisdiction of the Inferiours,
which is inough to proue a Supremacie.
               Thus hath M. Iewel brought foure
seueral Auncient Fathers, al in a cumpanie
togeather, to proue that, the B. of

Rome hath no speciall Priuilege aboue
others of binding and loosing. and there is
not one of them al, which proueth that
Cōclusion. For S. Cyprian, is plaine for
one head, notwithstanding the equalitie
of the Apostles in honour and power.
Origen, and S. Cyril, speake not literally
but mystically, And S. Basile last of all
telleth such a Trueth as euery Catholike
wil confesse, and is nothing contrarie to
the doctrine of the Supremacie, excepte
there be so vnsensible an heretike, that
wil think the lowest Minister in the congregation,
to be as high in Authoritie as
the greatest Superintendent or general,
because he preacheth and baptiseth, and
ministreth the Lordes Supper, and burneth
(if neede be) in his opinion, in lyke
sorte as the Chiefest Superintendentes
themselues doe.
               And this vanitie and falsehood of M.
Iewels, when he allegeth Auncient Fathers
wordes without their Sense, is so
common, that I wil be bounde to make a
whole boke of his So saith S. Cyprian, and
Therefore S. Hierome saieth, and other
such Idle Illations: if either it were not

inough, to note only what he is, Or if my
wil and leisure serued me so much, as to
be occupied in so tediouse A mater. But
now let vs goe forwarde with the Doctours,
and shew how shamefully he hath
abused them.
               Our Sauiour (saith D. Harding out of S.
Augustine) gaue not commaūdement, in vvhat
Order the Sacramēt should be receiued, meaning
to reserue that mater vnto the Apostles, by vvhom
he vvould direct and dispose his Church.
               Ergo, the obseruation, of number
of Communicāts, of Place, of Tyme,
of Order, Maner, and Circumstance
in Receiuing, dependeth of the Churches
ordinaunce, and not of Christes
Institution.
               S. Augstine abused.
               S. Augustine speaketh not one worde
of any number.Iew. 20.
               
               He speaketh of a power left with the
Apostles,Ra. to apoint in what order the
Sacrament should be Receaued, but the
Order and Manner of doing a thing, extendeth
it self to al Circumstances: ergo

to number also. And therefore it is no
wrong dealing, to inferre A particular
vpon the graunt of the proper vniuersal
thereof.
               
                  Againe, whereas the blessed Apostle,
after certaine talke had about the Sacrament,
                  1. Cor.11. 
                  concluded saying: Caetera cum venero
ordinabo, As for the rest vvhen I come my selfe
I vvil set in Order, S. Augustine inferreth,
Vnde datur intelligi

                   seruat ecclesia, ab ipso ordinatum
esse quod nulla morū diuersitate variatur. Wherof
it is geauen vs to vnderstand, that it vvas ordeined
of the Apostle, that vvhich is not varied by
any diuersity of maner & fashion, because it vvas,
much for him to shevv in an epistle, al that order
of Celebrating and Ministring the Communion,
vvhich the vvhole Church through out all the
vvorld doth obserue.
               As who should say: If it had not ben,
that the Apostle had not place inough, in
his Epistle to the Corinthians, to declare
his mind at ful: In what order, and with
what Ceremonies and Circumstancies,
he would haue the celebrating of y• mysteries
to procede, he would haue left it in

plaine writing, how al thinges should
be don: but because that was to much for
an epistle, to receaue, And because the order
which he would haue obserued, was
not so quickly appointed, as to Reade A▪
Chapiter or two of the Bible, and to tell
the storie of Christs entring into his passion,
and that done, to receiue bread and
wine in remembrance thereof, and to be
thankeful: therefore he promised to come
hymselfe, and set thinges in order: and
therefore such orders and maners, as the
whole Church hath and doth throughly
vse, about the celebration of the Mysteries,
are to be thought to haue come from
the Apostles.
               Of these words then also (As for the rest
vvhen I come my selfe, I vvil dispose) it maie,
with good reason, be gathered, that the
Apostle did prescribe orders and rules to
be obserued concerning Persons, Time,
and Place, with other Circumstances,
And that the Institution of Christ, stretched
no further than to Consecration,
Oblation and Participation of his pretious
bodie: And that one alone or manie
togeather to receaue, was not, by Christ,

apointed, but left to his Apostles to be
ordered. But it foloweth in M. Iewel:
that,
               S. Augustine in this place,Iew. 20. speaketh not
one word of any number. But, only of the
time of Receauing, whether it might seme
conuenient to minister the Communion
after Supper.
               You be verie bold,Ra. either with S.
Augustine, or with your Reader. Doe ye
cal y• speaking only of the time,

                        ••
                     s where the
question of tyme is not at al spoken of?
Reade the place who wil, and if there be
any such question intreated, as M. Iewel
reporteth, although I haue many Arguments
to the contrarie, yet wil I say he
is an honest and true man.
               In the fifthe chapiter of that epistle,
these questions are mentioned, whether
vpon good friday, Oblation and Sacrifice
should be done twise, in the morning
first, and then after supper, Item, whether
the people should, first keepe their
faste, then eate that daies meale, and last
of all haue the Oblation and Sacrifice
made. Or, first keepe their faste, and then
haue the Sacrifice made, and last of al go

to their meales meat. To which questiōs
his answer is, that euery man should, in
these points, do, as ye vse of the church is,
vnto which he cummeth. Because ther is
nothing in them, against either Faith or
good maners.
               In the next chapiter folowing, out
of which D. Harding toke his testimony,
the question & doubt is, not, whether one
might Offer or Receaue in the morning,
or at euening (which perteineth to tyme)
but, whether he that had eaten the same
daie before, might afterwardes either
Offer, or Receaue the bodie of Christe,
whiche is A Question concerninge the
state of the Persons only, And not the
qualitie of Tyme.
                  The reuerence geuē to the Sacrament. Unto which, his answer
is, that it hath pleased y• holy Ghost,
that for the honour of so great a Sacrament,
the bodie of our Lord should first
enter into the mouth of a Christian, before
external and carnal meates.
               Now because the heretike might say
(as some in these daies vphold) where is
it in al the Scripture, that a man should
come fasting to the communion? And whi
might not one (if he would) receiue after

Supper, as the Apostles dyd, or in the
Supper tyme, as the Corinthians dyd:
S. Augustine meeteth with this obiection,
alleging that sentence which M. Harding
to like effect vsed, and saying: That
in vvhat order the Sacrament should be receiued,
Christ gaue no precept thereof, but left that office
to his Apostles.
               
               Let M. Iewel now, defend hymselfe,
if he can, and proue, that he hath not
falsly reported of S. Augustine, in the
place of the Epistle ad 
                        •
                     anuarium, saying
of hym, that he speaketh not one word of
the number (of Cōmunicantes) but only
of the tyme of Receauing.
               
               
                  That he speaketh only of the time of
Receauing, it is false. For these be his
wordes: Saluator non praecepit quo deinceps ordine
sumeretur, vt Apostolis, per quos dispositurus
erat, ecclesiam, seruaret hunc locum. Our Sauiour
gaue no commaundemēt, in vvhat order it should
be Receaued, to the intent he might leaue that
mater to his Apostles, by vvhom he vvould dispose
his Church.
               Hereof I gather this Argument.
The apointing of Order, how thinges
should be don, doth extend itself to more,

than apointing only of the time, in which
it is to be done:S. 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   But, of the Authoritie
left with the Apostles, to set an Order in
Receauing of the Sacrament, S. Augustine
doth speake, in his epistle 
                     〈…〉
                  
speaketh only of the tyme of receauing.

saith: Dominica oratio apud Graecos ab omni populo

Our Lordes praier is said among the Grecians,
of al the people, but with vs, it is saied by the

Iewel) was the Masse of S. Gregories

two thinges). If it were a priuate masse,
then must you yeld and subscribe, because

otherwise emonge the Greekes, and in
their Communion the people saied the
Lords praier al together.Ergo M. Iew hath belied him Yea, but S. Gregorie noteth not only such point, and
he speaketh not, of their communion, or
not Cōmunion. So that you be exceding

much to blame for abusing the names of
holy Doctours so vainely, and making

               Remember then,Ra. what the mater is.
You must proue out of S. Cyprian, that
the people should Receaue not in the one
kinde alone of Bread,Marke what is to be proued. but of wine. also
And if you (M. Iewel) wil not remember
it, yet I praie thee (gentle Reader) to
marke diligently whether he proue any
such thing out of S. Cyprian.
               Some ther be,Iew. that in sanctifiyng the cup,
and deliuering it to the people, do not that

thing that Iesus Christ our Lord and God,Cypri. li 2 Epist. 3.
the Author and Teacher of this Sacrifice,
both did and tawght.
               Surely, whosoeuer he be that doth
so,Ra. is much to blame. For Christes Institution
is to be obserued. But the question
is, whether to deliuer the Chalice to
the laie people, be of y• necessitie of Christes
Institution. But go ye further in
S. Cyprian.
               He addeth further.Iew. If any man be in this
errour,Truely saied, but to no purpose. seing the light of the Trueth let him
returne againe vnto the Roote, and vnto
the Original of the Lordes Tradition.
               This also is wel done, so charitably
to warne the deceaued,Ra. to returne vnto
the trueth. But I thinke it is not wisely
done, to speake so generally of errour
and truth, our question being specially
about one Article. But you haue more to
say out of S. Cyprian.
               And after in the same Epistle,Iew. we keep
                     •
                  
not the thing that is commaunded vs,

                   vnlesse
we do the same that the Lord did.
               Here is much a do to proue,Ra. that we
must keepe the Iustitution of Christe,
which we do not denie: but where is it

                     •
                  ere, y• giue the Cup vnto the people

is Christes Institution, so absolute, that
they may not be serued in one kinde?
Proue this, which we aske, out of S. Cyprian,
and let that passe, which we nothing
doubt of. It foloweth.
               In these few wordes,Iew. S. Cyprian saith,
the Lord both did it & taught it to be don.Craftely
He calleth it the Lordes commaundemēt.
               What is this (it) of which you speake?Ra.
Why name ye not the thing it selfe, that
we may know where about ye go? Say,
if ye dare, that by this terme (it) you vnderstand
the deliuery of the Cup vnto
the people. If ye dare, how can you verifie
it, That the Lord did it? For Christ,M. Iew. apprehended.
I am sure, gaue not the Cup in his last
supper to the peple. If ye dare not, what
honestie is this, to bring in so craftely into
your conclusion, that, which was not
proued by the premisses?
               Is this the S. Cyprian, whom in
steed of many you promised to allege? Is
this y• 
                  shortnes for which sake you would
allege but one Father? Cal ye these words
of S. Cyprians, verie plain, for proufe hereof,
y• Christes Institution chargeth vs to
deliuer the Cup also, vnto the people,

whereas he speaketh of no such controuersie
at al.
               M. Harding (you say) can not here stealeIew.
awaie in the myste and saie, S. Cyprian
meant al this of the cup that the Priest cōsecrateth
for himself. For his words be plaine
to the contrarie, In calice dominico sanctificando
& ministrando, that is, insactifieng
the Lordes cup, and ministring it vnto the
People.
               Steale you awaie,Ra. no more than D.
Harding doth, and it wil sone be perceaued
who is the theefe. For in deede, you
plaie that good felows part, which being
himselfe in daunger of 
                     •
                  aking, woulde
point to another y• is giltlesse,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   and did the
standers by to looke that he scape not
awaie from them. As if he should say, my
masters and frendes, of al thinges I hate
stealing and iuggling. And see therefore
I praie you, diligently to that fellowe
that goeth yonder, y• he cast not a myste
before your eyes, and so steale awaie.
               For that which you speake, as it
were to take D. Harding, as though he
would flee from that, which you imagine
against him, that is nothing so. D. Harding
wil not, I warrant you, say, that

S. Cyprian meant al y• you haue recited
out of him, of the cup that y• Priest consecrateth
for himselfe. But as the Catholike
Church leadeth hym, he confesseth,
that in y• primitiue Church the people receaued
in both kindes. And therefore S.
Cyprian speaking of the Cup sanctified
and distributed vnto the people, can not
moue hym (which confesseth it, to be agreable
with that tyme) to steale awaie
for the matter.
               But here is the question, whether this
distributing of the Cup to the people, be
That tradition, for keeping of which, S.
Cypriane maketh, so iustly, so manie
words? Do you marke this M. Iewel?
Steale not you, I praie you, awaie here
in this place. We confesse that the cup
was deliuered vnto y• people, in S. Cyprians
tyme, but we aske now, whether
S. Cyprian in this foresaid epistle,Answer directly saith,
that it is the Institution of Christ that it
should be so. The fact we graunt, but of
the necessitie of it, whether vpon paine of
Gods Indignation, the people muste
haue the Cup deliuered vnto them, that
we demaund, And to that you answer,

that they must, And to that you applie
these foresaied testimonies, making your
Reader, to beleue that the Lordes Tradition
and y• Lords commaundement of
which S. Cyprian speaketh so ernestly,

                     〈◊〉
                   meant of the deliuerie of the Cup vnto
the people.
               But, if there were no other argument
to the contrarie, what yet could be spoken
more absurdly and idlely? For if the
Tradition of our Lord, which S. Cyprian
mentioneth, is to be vnderstanded
of y• deliuerie of the cup to the people, of
which point only, our question is, then
Ioe, when he saieth: Some there be, that in

                        〈◊〉
                      the Cup. and deliuering it vnto the

                        〈◊〉
                     , doe not that thing, that Iesus Chrifst both

                        〈◊〉
                      and taught. he should meane thus, that
Some there be that in sanctifieng the
Cup and deliuering it to the people,
doe not deliuer it vnto the people, as
our Lord both did and taught.
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
               
               And how then doth this geare hang
togeather, that, in deliuering it vnto the
people, they should not deliuer it vnto
the people? Or, that S. Cyprian should

reproue any man for not keeping of our
lords traditiō in deliuering of y• Cup to y•
people, wheras he plainly saith that it is
sanctified & deliuered, and yet, that our
Lords tradition is not obserued? By
which it is most euident, that the Tradition,
which S. Cyprian in this place, so
grieuou
                     •
                  lie taketh to be omitted, can not
possibly be referred to the deliuery of the
Cup to the people, which he confesseth to
be obserued.
               And this much might be said with good
reason, if S. Cyprians meaning were
not to be found expressed in open words,
within ten lines of these, which M. Iew.
hath rehersed. But it is so euidēt, y• euen
at the very begining of y• Epistle, he declareth▪
what the cause of his writing is,
and what the fault is, which he woulde
haue amended. For the first Sentence
thereof hath this sense.
               Albeit I knovv (most deere brother) that many
Bishops do keepe the Order and Rules of our
Lordes Tradition, yet because some in sanctifieng
the Cup and deliuering it vnto the people, do not
that thing, which our Lord both did and taught,
I thought it good and necessary to vvrite letters

therof vnto you, that if any man be deceiued, he
may returne, vnto the Original of our Lordes
Tradition.
               This is the first sentence, in which
there is Generally signified a thing to be
amisse, but what that is, it is not yet specially
declared. And out of this one sentence,
M. Iew. peeketh an absolute Testimonie,
y• it is Christes Institutiō, that
the people should haue the Cup deliuered
vnto them, because he loueth not y• truth
should be stolen away in a mist. The sēse
of the next sentence is,
               And thinke not (most deere Brother) that
I vvrite this vpon myne ovvne minde and vvil,
but when any thing is cōmaunded by the Inspiration
of God, the faithful seruaunt must obey.
               So that this hitherto is nothing but a
preface or entrance to the mater. Then
foloweth the third sentence.
               Admonitos autem nos scias. &c. But ye shal
vnderstand, that vve are vvarned (by special
reuelacion from God) that in offering of the
Chalice the Traditiō of our Lord be kept, & that
no other thing be don of vs, than that which out

                     •
                  ord did for vs, first▪ that the Chalice vvhich is offered

                  .
               
                  
Lo this is the state of y• whole Epistle,
and the Tradition & Commaundement of God,
which so oft & so earnestly he speaketh of,
is referred to this end only, y• wine & water
should be offered vp togeather in the
Mysteries. And y• fault which he findeth
with the celebrating y• some vsed, was, y•
they toke water only into y• Chalice,Wine and water to be mingled
togeather in the Chalice is y• Tradition and Cōmaundement of Christ. like as on the cōtrary side y• Heretikes now
take only wine. Both which extremes
the Traditiō & Cōmaundement of God
(which S. Cyprian doth proue, by y• olde
and new Testament most abundantly)
doth so fully & perfitely confound, that as
the Aquarij then were disproued, so the Vinarij
now should be ashamed.
               But as concerning the diliuering of
the Sacrament, in one or both kindes, he
intended it not, nor determineth it. And
this M. Iewel perceiued wel inough, y•
S. Cyprian in that Epistle was wholy
bent against Aquarij (were they schismatikes
only or heretiks) and, that the fault
which he laboreth to amēd in them, was,
not for not geuing the cup vnto the people,
but for geuing water only in it, and
not wine mixt with water.
               
                  
Where then was M. Iewels wit to
let go many fathers,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   which he wold haue
it thought, to be for him, and, for shortnes
sake to allege only S. Cyprian, and, that
S. Cyprian should speake nothing at al,
of that questiō which properly is demaū
                  ded
of vs, and to which we looked for an
absolute and perfite answer from him?
               It is not credible but he saw wel
inough, what we could Replie, and therfore
he prouided this safegard for his estimation.
For thus he saith:
               If S. Cyprian might wel write thus againstIewel.
the Heretikes called Aquarij,See the fetch, least 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   which
in the holy ministratiō, would not vse wine
but in stede thereof did Consecrate water,
and Ministred it vnto the People, much
more may we say the same against our Aduersaries,
which Consecrate and Minister
vnto the people, no Cup at al.
               What you may saie, it is an other
question, but we seke now, what S. Cyprian
did say. If that Learned and
blessed Father, whom you haue alleaged
in stede of many, if he spake nothing directly
of our question, it is no mater to
vs, what you wil Applie him vnto, neither
was it cunningly inough donne of

you, to bring him alone (whereas you
had, except you belie your selfe, copie)
which maketh nothing at al for you, but
by a consequence of your owne deuising.
               And yet this very Consequence of
yours,M. Iewels fetch, dissapointed doth nothing folow. for to consecrate
in water onely, and to minister it so
vnto the people (which clause of ministring
it vnto the people, is in deede out of
the mater which S. Cyprian discussed.
But let it occupie a place, if you thinke
it wil ease you) To Consecrate (I say
againe) in water only, and to minister it so
vnto the people, is against the Tradition,
Institution, and Cōmaundement of our
Sauiour. And this is proued at large
throughout y• whole epistle of 
                     •
                  . Cypri
                     ••
                  .
               But, to cōsecrate the wine & water together,
& not to minister it vnto y• people
who is against it? what Scripture, coūcel,
or father? You say it is against Christes
Institutiō. We deny it. You made,
as though you would proue it ou
                     •
                   of S.
Cyprian. But S. Cypriā speaketh not of
this questiō: yet, you say, y• as 
                     •
                  . Cypriā
spake against y• 
                  Aquarios for 
                     〈◊〉
                   in
water only, and ministring it so vnto the

people: so may you much more speake against
the Church, for ministring no Cup
at al vnto the peple. I haue shewed how
vnlike this comparison is.
               But wil you haue a good Argument,
and like to y• of s. Cyprians? This it is.
               S. Cyprian iustlie founde faulte
with the Aquarios for consecrating
in water onely,In Inuincible
Argumēt except M Iew, wil denie S. Cyprians authoritie which only he hath vsed in steede of many Fathers. and ministring it so
vnto the peple: Ergo, he would haue
found fault with your Procedings,
which put wine only in the Cup, and
minister it so vnto the people.
               For the Reason on both sides is one,
that the Tradition of our Lord, is to be
obserued, and that to Consecrate wine
and water togeather, was his Traditiō.
               Answere this Argument with al your
cūning (Learned M. Iewel) and answer
your deere friendes expectation, which
wil thinke, that you haue not abused S.
Cyprian. The iudgement wherof, I
permit, vnto any reasonable Aduersarie.
               S. Augustine abused.
               S. Augustine, willing the Priestes to applie

their studies,Iew. 156 to correct their errours
of their Latin speach, addeth thervnto this
Reason, Vt populus ad id quod planè intellig

               How can it seeme so,Ra. wheras he so expresly
speketh of the Latin tongue only?
               S. Augustine (you say) willing the Priestes,Iew.
&c.Ra. This first of al is falsely reported.
For S. Augustin in this place,False.
went
not about to exhorte the Priestes to the
studie of y• Latine tongue, as who should
thinke that it were not to be suffered, A
Priest or Bishop to be ignorant therein:
but he shewed, how such, as come fresh &
fine from the Scholes of Grammarians,
and Rhetoricians, with knowledge and
Eloquence inough of wordes, should, in
their first entrance into y• church, there to
be instructed of y• Catholike Faith, learne
to be humble & wise in iudgement, & not
to contemne y• Scriptures, because they
be not writēin so loftie & exquisit a Style
as prophane bokes, nor to set more by florish
of words, than substance of Sense.

they shel perceiue them to cal vpō God,
either vvith barbarouse and incongrae Latine: or

either to point them out of order.
               To such therfore, S. Austine directeth
his talke in y• place, & maketh no exhortatiō
at al to Priestes, to learne their latine
tongue better. And why should M. Iew.
dissemble y• true persons, of whom s. Augustine
there speaketh? I wil tel you:
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
There is not a place more plainer than
this, if it be considered, to proue y• it was
not thought in S. Augustines time, so
necessary a m

                  t
                     •
                  r, that al thinges in the
Churche should be donne in a knowen
Tongue, as now it is auouched to be.
               
                  For if the Publike Seruice was euerie
where executed, at that tyme, in the
vulgar Tongue, or in a knowē one to the
common people, although it were not
their vulgar, how is it possible, that the
Bishopes themselues, should be to seeking
in the right pronouncing, & pointing,
and vnderstanding of that, whiche
they openly said in the Church?
               The Syr Iohn Lacklatines (of which
there is much speaking among the brothers)
they haue ben such an occasion of
ruine and perdition to the worldly wise,
as none hath ben greater. For the euil
life of Priestes, although it be A greate
Argument vnto them, that the Religion
is not effectual, which hath such holy ons
in it: yet whiles they see in euerie kinde
of Protestation or Confession,Lacke of knowledg doth more hurti this 
                        〈…〉
                      lacke of good li
                        •
                     e. many such
to be found, of whō they may wel inough
be ashamed, they temper their Iudgement,
and wil not vtterly condemne a
Religion for this cause only, that some
Professours thereof be wicked.
               But when they see Publike Seruice
to be saied of them which vnderstand it
not, and for them which are also as ignorant,

this seemeth to be so absurde, that
they can not conceaue, howe the Spirite
of God should directe their doeinges,
which see, and suffer, yea and defend, that
Publike Seruice maie be done, in a tong
which the vulgar people doe not vnderstand.
And in this point, they are so much
the more vehement, because they see, how
all the new Gospellers folow a contrary
waie, and vse no lerned Tounge at all in
their Ordinary Seruice, but the vulgar
and knowen Tounge of the Countrie,
where they pitch. So that, the Protestantes
are compted herein, to worke so sincerely,
to speake so reasonably, and to
chalenge so inuincibly, that thousandes
of the worldly wise, whiles they stand in
their owne iudgement, fal in deede into
euerlasting per
                     •
                  ition, by the iudgement
of the blessed and lerned Fathers.
               For, if al thinges must be don in the
Church, so, as the people do vnderstand
what is praied, how should that case euer
be heard of in the Primitiue Churche,
where some Bishoppes, vnderstode not
what they praied in the open Church?
               Maie we think, that any of them,

vnderstoode not the vulgare speache of
his coūtrie? That is verie incredible, because,
vnto the high office, of Ruling and
teaching the whole People,That the Seruice was in S. Augustines tyme in y• latin Tongue which was vnknowē to y• vulgare
                        •
                      people. he should
not be chosen, which could not wel be
vnderstanded of the people.
               But maie we rather thinke, that the
publike Seruice, was in a lerned toung,
sometymes not perfitly knowen of the
Bishope himselfe, like as vnto the vulgar
people it was not knowen? Of this,
there is no doubt: Because in praieng to
God, deuotion and not eloquntion is required,
and because he might haue a good
grace, of preaching in his natural tongue
vnto the people, which yet had very simple
vnderstanding, of any Greeke or latine
writinges: And because, it is plaine
by S. Augustine, that some such were in
his tyme.
               How then (you wil saie) is Ignorance
in a Bishope to be suffered? I say
not so, neither on the other side, I thinke
that al is marred, except euery man, woman
and childe maie haue the Bible in
the vulgar Tounge. Or, that no Tounge
is to be suffered in the Church of God,

but that, which is the common and knowen
tounge, of the Countrie. But as
there is a difference betwene wincking
and staring, so is there a discreation and
iudgement to be vsed in this mater of
Tounges of which we speake. And S.
Augustine aloweth it not, that a Bishope
should not vnderstand the Latin tounge
in which he praieth, neither yet doth he
crie out against that lacke of theirs, requiring
that al Publike Seruice should
straitwaies be in the vulgare Tounge.
For after he had told it, how some Bishopes
praie in false and barbarouse Latine,
and vnderstād not what they praie,
he addeth further least, you should think
hym to alowe Ignorance, and saieth:

alow not their lacke of knowledge: And
it were wel, that they dyd so speake, as
the people vnderstand them) Sed tamen pie

are charitably to be borne vvithal, of them,
vvhich haue lerned, that as thinges are vvel said

so are they vvel saied in the Church, by vovve of

               Of which wordes I gather, that as
he would wishe it better, y• the Bishops
& Priestes of the Church should so speak,
as the people might vnderstand: yet, he
would not haue the Seruice of the church
vtterly chaunged from the Latine tonge

which nor Priest nor peole could be ignorant
of. But, euen those wātes of some
Bishopes and Priestes,The Ignorance of the latine tongue in the Latine praiers is to be tolerated in A Priest or Bishop, & not moke

charitably borne and suffered, vpon this
consideration, that although in the eares
of men, their wordes sound not plaine
and good, yet in y• sight of God, the good
affection of their harte is alowed.
               
                  
Now if S. Augustine had ben of the
Protestantes mind, he would not haue
takē the mater so quietly, but with great
Stomake would haue said, awaie with
this murmuring of praiers not vnderstanded:
awaie with this Latine and
Strange tounge, which,S. Augu. would nener haue saied so. the Priest hymselfe
knoweth not, what it meaneth: Awaie
with this lip labour: Let vs haue
the Bible turned into the vulgar tounge,
let euery man come to the Church and
singe Psalmes to the Lord: let the people
vnderstand what is said: let vs do as the
Apostle commaundeth vs, let vs speake
with tounges: and so furth, with a great
tale, out of the xiiij. Chapiter of the first
to the Corinthians, altogeather out of
purpose.
               But, as it appeereth by this place,
which I haue opened, S. Augustine was
of an other mind, & would haue geuē such
Protestantes an other lesson, that they
should not mocke at poore Syr Iohns,
which praie in latine and yet vnderstand
not latine, like as his counsel is, to eloquent
and smoeth tounged Gentlemen,
that come from secular Scholes, to the

Church of Christ, there to be instructed.
               And because the opening of so much,
would haue ben a great disauantage to
M. Iewel and his felowes, therefore he
speaketh only of Priestes whom S. Augustine
willed to correct the errours of
their latine tounge, and dissimbleth the
answer, which S. Augustine geueth to
those ioly felowes, which would be ready
to mocke at Priests, because of their barbarouse
and false praieng, in the Publike
Seruice. By which we vnderstand, that
the publike Seruice was then in Latine,
and that it was so strainge also vnto the
vulgar people, that some of the Priestes
and Bishopes did not vnderstand it.
               Of this also it foloweth, that the conclusion
which M. Iewel peeketh out of
this testimonie of S. Austine, is so grosse
and vnsensible, that I wonder where his
wittes were when he wrote it. Thus
he saieth.
               This of S. Augustin seemeth to be spoken
generally of al tounges.Iew.
                  False and absurde.
               
               Seemeth it so in deede?Ra. And do not
your self so vnderstād the place in y• very
begynning of your alleging thereof, that

you saie, S. Augustine willeth the Priestes
to correct the errours of their latine tonge?
If then it be the latine tongue by name,
for which he reasoneth, how doth it s

                  me
vnto you that he speaketh generally of al
Tounges?
               Againe, if he spake generally of al tounges,
ergo of the Punike tounge. I aske
you then, which of the two, it is like that
the Aphricanes vnderstoode better, the
Aphricane and Punike tounge, Or the
Latine?
               If the Aphricane (as being their natural
and vulgar tounge) was more familiar
with them, why doth S. Augustine
wil the Priests to studie the Latine
tounge, that the people might vnderstād
them the better, wheras (by your accōpt)
they should haue spoken in their owne
vulgar tongue, and so with lesse labour,
the people should haue ben more edified?
               If the Latin was more familiar, how
could any Priest or Bishope in Aphrica,
be so ignorant thereof,Here is no escape or shift for M. Iew. that he should not
pronounce his Latine praiers, and vnderstand
them? Or, how doth S. Augustin
seeme to speake generally of al tongues,
                  
which extendeth out his Reason and argument,
no not vnto the Punik tongue?

Yet, M. Iewel thinketh, that
S. Hierome Answereth this foresaied
question, and that he maketh a ful determination
thereof, with an ernest reprouf
of the parties offending against it. As
if S. Hierom should say to the Romai

what meane you to doubt in this
plaine mater? Or why should ye thinke
that Receauing at home were lawfull?
Do ye not know that the Lordes supper
is 
                     •
                   Communion, and must not be taken
of one alone? Why dare ye not goe to the
Temples of the Martyrs▪

                  ? Why goe ye not to the Church?
                  
Is not that, the proper place, to Receaue
the Communion in?
               Such a Comment would M. Iewel
make vpon S. Hierome, And to this effect,
he draweth his ernest and sharpe
Interrogations. But y• case vnto which
S. Hieromes words do rightly answer,
is only this. Whether he, that hath had
carnal knowledge of his Wife the night
before, do not wel to absteine the next day
from going to y• Memories of Martyrs,
and the Churches abroade, Or whether
he may not Receaue the Sacrament at
home? To which his Answer shortly is
this, that he may as wel receiue at church
as at home, and that he should doe wel
not to receaue at al, the day folowing the
night of his carnal pleasure, wt his wife.
               
                  For after he had said, that he would
neither reproue nor cōmend the Custome
of daily receiuing of the faithful of Rome:
he cōmeth in with an aduersatiue But, in
this sort: Sed ipsorum conscientiam conuenio,
qui eodem die post coitum cōmunicant &c. Quare
ad Matyres ire non audent? Quare non ingrediuntur
ecclesiaes? But yet I appose their cōscience,
vvhich cōmunicate the same day after they haue

carnally knovven their Vviues. VVhy dare they
not goe to the Martyrs Memories? VVhy goe they
not to Church? Is Christ one abroade, an other at
home? That, vvhich is not lavvful at Church, is
not lauful at home. To God nothing is hidden, ye

                  e also shineth before him. Let euery one
examine himself, & so come to the body of Christ.
               To this end therefore S. Hierome
bringeth his whole Argument, not, that
it were simplie to be reproued to rece
                     •
                  ue
at home, but, that such as had companied
with their wi
                     •
                  es the night before, should
not the day after Receaue at home, considering
that they are worthily abashed to
come before the Martyrs Reliques after
such nightes, and that Christ is to be honoured,
aboue al, and in al places, both at
home and abroade. Of which conclusion
it would folow, that Matrimonie is not
so good as Uirginitie, which was one of
the heresies of the Protestant Ioninian,
whereas by the Acte of Matrimonie,
the partie is made for a tyme vnmeete to
Receaue the blessed Sacrament.
               Iudge thou now (Indifferent Reader)
whether S. Hierome doth ernestly
reproue the custom of Receiuing at home,
                  
without any addition of such Circumstance
as varieth the whole question.
               S. Angustine abused.

                     ho is he (saieth D. Harding out of
S. Augustine) that knovveth not, that the
Principalitie of Apostleship, is to be preferred before
any Bishoprike that is? Which words S.
Augustine speaketh, because of a comparison
which he made, betwene S. Peter
and S. Cyprian. For whereas the Donatistes,
dyd much obiect against the Catholikes,
that S. Cyprian, with many
other his Felowbishopes, concluded and
determined in a Coū

                  el had emong themselues,
that such as were baptized of heretikes
should be rebaptized againe, whē
they came to the Catholike Church, by
which Authoritie of S. Cyprians name &
other Bishops many, thei thought to bear
downe y• papists before them: S. Austine,
like an holy & reuerend father, contēneth
not the Authority of S. Cyprian, but preferreth
y• authoritie of S. Peter, before it.
               Now, these foresaid words making
expressly for the Principalitie of the Apostleshipe
which was in S. Peter, what
saicth M. Iewel vnto them? Mary his

first Answer is that Principatus Principality,
doth not signifie an vniuersal power,
                  Iew. 249 Spoken grammatically.
Of which Answer we haue already spoken,
but shortly, this may be repeted, that
although Principatus, put alone by it
self, doth not signifie alwaies an vniuersal power
(for in euery degree of act and
art the best hath the Principalitie, and yet
he shall not be Pope or Emperour) yet
Principatus Apostolatus, the Principalitie
of Apostleshipe, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   declare,
that in that Order itselfe of Apostles, he
that hath the Principalititie is the Chiefe.

                   which were heads of the world,
must needes be Supreame Gouernour
ouer al Christendom. And thus muche
shortly concerning M. Iewels first Answer.

then should D. Harding haue alleged
them, or why laie you dissimulation to

                        〈…〉
                     
                   
                  whether of the two
ought to be preferred before the other,
came not of ignorāce of that point, which
concerned the Supremacie of the See
and Church of Rome, but of this which
perteineth to their personal deserts and
merites. In which, he thinketh that the
one was equal with the other?
               
                  
And wherefore then haue you left out
those wordes that folowed so immediatly,
by which the true and right vnderstanding
of the place might be perceiued?
Is not this crafty dissimbling? Wil you
say that you dyd not see so much, whereas
so much foloweth immediatly in S.

                  rose? Or can you say y• you thought

                   Obiection, is
thereby vttered and expressed? But let
vs come neerer.
               Not six lyues before this place of
which you would haue your Reader to
geather, that S. Peter had no greater
Supremacie than S. Paule, thus saieth
S. Ambrose after a short discourse made
vpon S. Peter and Paule. Ambo igitur clau

So then both of them haue receaued 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of our Lord, S. Paule of science, S. Peter of povver.
               
               Consider now of this place, Indifferent
Reader, was S. Ambrose in any
doubt, which of the two, S. Peter or S.
Paul was to be preferred? He was,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   and
he was not. Concerning their godlines
and Merit
                     •
                  s, he knew not whom to preferre

before the other, but thinketh them
to be equal therein. Concerning Authoritie
and Office,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   he knew how to geaue
eche of thē his owne, preferring S. Paule
for his knowledge, and S. Peter for his
power. It is not therefore simply true,
as M. Iewel reherseth the wordes of S.
Ambrose, that, whether of them ought to
be preferred before the other it is not knowē.
For if he would haue looked to that,
which went but a litle before, he should
haue readen the keies of Science geauen
to S. Paule, and the keies of power to
S. Peter.
               What say we then to this blindnes
or Craft? Is M. Iewel that felow, that
doth not dissimble? Doth not he take
what hym lyketh, and refuse what hym
listeth? He beginneth Sentencies where
hym pleaseth. He endeth senses when he
is disposed. The myddle of Sentencies,
he leaueth quite and cleane out, That
which went before or commeth after, he
looketh nothing vnto, such is his Simplicitie.
To make hymselfe the lesse suspected,
he findeth (without iust occasion)
fault with other for leauing out I can

not tel what. To be short, there was neuer,
I thinke, an Heretike so ful of wordes,
so vntrue in wordes, so faire spoken,
so fowly intending, so muche alleging
Auncient Fathers, so litle regarding any
Authoritie, So precise in appealing to
phrases, termes, and ti
                     •
                  les, And so loose
in abusing the sense and the meaning of

                   is it posible that M.

                     〈…〉
                   place from lying?
               
                  
First it is most euident, that S. Bernard
hath no such wordes.In any of these two poīts M. Iew. may be apprehended. The Sermon
which M. Iewel referreth vs vnto,
is the holy Fathers Guerricus Abbat
of Igniacum.
               Then, neither he saith as M. Iewel
concludeth. For why? there is not in al
his Sermon, any mention of Bread and
Wine offered at the Aulter, Or, to the
Aulter, by men and women, Neither of
the Order of Melchisedech.
               Of the offering vp of Turtles and
Doues, he speaketh, but he meaneth not
of the birdes themselues, but of the vertues
represented by them: as Chastitie
of body and soule, Compunction of hart,
Simplicitie, Patience, Charitie, & such
like. Wherevpon he inferreth, concerning
Priestes, saying:
               Such manner of men it becommeth vs to be,Guerricus in Ser. de purificatione.
vvhen vve Consecrate the Body of Christ &c.
And concerning the Laietie: Such maner
of men also it behoueth you to be, vvhich receiue
of our handes, the holy Sacramen
                     •
                  , &c.
               Now because it might be obiected,
that it is for Priestes to haue the foresaid
vertues, Or that it is their charge onely,

to prepare them selues, least they receiue
the Sacrament vnworthily (as though
the standers by, had litle to do with him
in those maters) he answereth, We must
not beleue that the forsaid vertues are necessary
for the Priest only, as though he alone
should Consecrate or offer the Body
of Christ. He doth not sacrifice alone, he
alone doth not consecrate,A point of M. Iewels art. but al the cumpanie
of the faithful (and here M. Iewel
maketh a ful and a fowle point) that standeth
by doth consecrate with him, doth sacrifice
with him.
               
               But how? After the order of Melchisedech,
Or, by their own Act & Priesthood,
as M. Iewel gathereth? Surely, except
Guerricus him selfe had made it plaine,
in what sense the Priest and the People
do offer, no doubt, but M. Iewel in this
place, would outface vs, that this Abbat
meant, that men and women were Priestes
after the order of Melchisedech. Notwithstanding
that it is not saied, the cū
                     pani
of the faithful do cōsecrate, as though
they might do it by themselues, but they
consecrate with him (the Priest) signifieng
the Office to be singular. And it
foloweth in the Sermon.
               
                  
                  Neither the Carpenter alone doth make
a house, but one bringeth roddes, an other rafters,
an other postes or beames and other things.
By which Similitude, it is manifest, that
the people consecrate, in this sense, that
they bring sumwhat to that end. And
what is that? By this that foloweth it
wil be vnderstanded. For thus he concludeth.
               
                  Therefore the standers by, ought to haue of
their owne, euen as the Priest ought? What?
A Cope trow you M. Iewel, vpon their
backes, or a Surplesse like Ministers, or
power and Authoritie of Priesthod? No.

               Alexander of Hales abused.Iew. 98.
               
               The people taking but one kind only
receiueth iniurie, as M. Harding may see

by Alexander de Hales, and Durandus, &
other of his owne Doctours. Alexanders
wordes be these. Licèt illa Sumptio, &c.
Although that Order of Receiuing the Sacr
                     •
                  ment▪
which is vnder one kinde, be sufficient,
yet the other which is vnder both
kindes, is of greater merite.
               Al this,Ra. M. Iewel, is true: but this
proueth not, that the people haue any
iniury done vnto them. For to Receiue

                     
                        •
                     nder one kinde, it is sufficient by Alexanders
expresse wordes: but vndoubtedly,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
if any thing lacked of that which were
d
                     •
                  e▪ there wer not sufficiēcy: Ergo, how
proue you by Alexander, that the people
are I
                     •
                  iuried, in receiuing vnder one
kinde?
               You wil Replie out of him, that it is
of greater merite to receiue in both kinds,
than one. And what of 
                     •
                  hat? It is a
greater merite to Celebrate thrise a day
(as at Christmasse) then once,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   as Ordinarily
Priestes do vse. Do ye thinke
then, that any Priestes haue Iniury don
vnto them, because the Order is otherwise,
that they say but one Masse in one
daie, except one daie onely in the yeare?
               Againe I say, that Alexander noteth

a greater merite to be in Receiuing vnder
both than one kind, not in respect of
the Sacramente, which is as perfite in
one as both, and in the least part of one,
as the whole: but in respect of the Receiuers,
because their deuotion is encreased,
and their Faith dilated by longer cō
                  tinuing
in th
                     •
                   Act of Receiuing, and their
Receiuing is more Complete as being
ministred in both kindes. And as the
causes on the behalfe of the Receiuer, do
make it, to a person so disposed, more effectual,
to Receiue in both than one: So
other causes there be, which doe make y•
Receiuing vnder one kinde, to be to the
party so affected, more fruietful and meritorious,
than if he tooke both. For,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     . he
that would say vnto him self, I wil content
my selfe with the common Order of
the Church, I wil not make any Sturre
about both kindes, knowing y• as much
is vnder one as both: vndoubtedly such
a man should both for his Humilitie, and
for his Faith, deserue more a great deale,
then if he should Receiue in both kindes,
and find a certaine sense and tast of Denotion.
               
                  
The strength therefore and efficatie
which Alexander speaketh of, depending
vpon the Act of the Receiuer, and not
vpon the Uertue of y• Sacrament, which
is al one in effect, whether it be ministred
in one or both kindes: M. Iewel doth
very iniuriously, to put a fault herein, y•
they Receiue not vnder both, & to make
Alexander of this opinion, that to minister
in one kinde, were an Iniurie vnto
the people.
               For this I would aske further of
him, whether the simple and deuout people,
are not more stirred vp to remember
the Death and Blo
                     •
                  d of Christe,A Case to M. Iew. if they
should Receiue in Claret or Red Wine,
than in White? No doubt, but the imaginatiō
would be more affected and moued,
by seeing a like colour vnto y• which
it would conceiue, than a contrary or diuerse
colour. How then? Would M.
Iewel thinke it an Iniury to minister in
white wine vnto the people, though thei
would be desirous of Red? He should
not thinke it, if he be wise. And why so?
Mary, because they haue as much in the
White as the Red, and to receiue in Red,

hangeth vpon their priuate deuotion, &
not vpon any precept of the Churche, or
doctrine of the Apostles, or Institution
of Christe, to which onely, the Priest is
bound, and which, if he obserue, he doth
his duety,
               Be it so then, that many good 
                     •
                  olke
for diuerse causes, should be exceedingly
moued and edified, by drinking of the
Chalice, and contemplating of more then
is Ordinarie in their minde: should they
haue any Iniurie done vnto them, if they
receiued afterwardes, when the Priest
should iudge it expedient, vnder y• forme
of bread only? Neyther doth Alexander
de Hales so say, neither any reason
doth make for it. But let vs see an other
place of Alexander, which M. Iewel
hath abused.
               The same Alexander againe saith,Iew. 99. Shamfully abused. Totus
Christus, &c. Whole Christ is not conteined
vnder ech kind by way of Sacramēt
but the fleash onely, vnder the fourme of
bread, and the bloud vnder the fourme of
wine.
               The woordes can not be denied to
be Alexanders,Ra. but what se
                     •
                  se gathereth
M. Iewel of them?
               
                  
Here M. Hardinges owne Doctours
confesse,Few. Open Lie that the people Receiuing vnder
one kinde, receiueth not the ful Sacramēt,
nor the bloud of Christe by way of Sacrament.
               You vnderstand not Alexander,Ra. or
you wil not. For, whereas he saith:
Christ is not conteined vnder ech kinde Sacramentally,
he meaneth not, that the people
Receiue not the Ful Sacrament and their
owne Maker, Godde and Manne, vnder
eche kinde: but by this woorde Sacramentally,
he meaneth, that concerning
the forme of wordes, by which consecration
is perfited in eche kinde, and by external
forme of the Signes vnder which
Christ is exhibited, the flesh only is conteined
vnder the forme of Breade, and the bloud vnder
the forme of Vvine As, when Christ said:
This is my bloud: the woordes which we
heare, doe signify no more than Bloude
to be there present, And y• external Signe
and liquor of wine, doth represent a presence
of bloud onely. And this is that

                     •
                  hich Alexander meaneth, by the worde
Sacramentally, when he saith, Vvhole Christ
is not conteined vnder ech kind Sacramentally.
                  
For he speaketh of the representation only
which is made to our senses, by exter
                  
                     •
                  al
words & Signes, and not of y• thing
it selfe and substance of the Sacrament,
which is apprehended by Faith.
               Now that Alexander was not of
this mind, which M. Iew. would make
him to be of, that whole Christ should
not be receaued vnder ech kind, though
whole Christ were not signified by the
sound of the wordes of Consecration in
ech kind, it is manifest by the next article
in him,q. 4
                        •
                     . Mem. 3. art. 3. where he concludeth, that, Christus
integer Deus & homo est sub specie Panis, Vvhole

               Alexander therfore, speaketh no otherwise
in this point, then it becummeth A
faithful and Catholike man to do. And
M. Iewel doth no otherwise, than he is

wont to do, but otherwise surely than becumneth
an honest and lerned man, specially

Scholemen, and lesse neede to corrupt
them, when he allegeth them.

               S. Cyprian calleth the Church of
Rome,Cyp. lib. 1. Epist. 3. 
                  Ecclesiam principalem, vnde vnit as Sacerdet

vvhence the Vnitie of Priestes hath spronge. Out
of which testimonie M. Iewel gathereth
A force, as it were, of two Argumentes
that might be made, the one in that it is
called, Ecclesia principalis, the principal or chief
Churche:
the other because it foloweth,
vnde vnitas Sacordotalis exorta est (whiche
words D. Harding doth interpret thus)
from vvhence the vnitie of Priestes is spronge.
M. Iewel thus, frō whence the vnitie of
the Priesthood first began. In which his
Interpretation there is a plaine falsehod
and craftines.
               For in repeting the wordes, and in
writing of them, so as if they were D.
Hardings, it becummed hym to deliuer
them furth in the same forme, as he 
                     •
                  ound

them in D. Harding. Then, whereas
it is not al one to say, the vnitie of Priesthood
sprange from Rome, and the vnitie
of Priesthod began first at Rome (for there
may be springs two or three in one place,
and although the water issue not out, first
at the lowest, yet the lowest of the three
maie be the chiefe head vnto al the riuers
beneth) M. Iewels intent was not simple,
to cast in this word (first) into the sentence,
as though the question were, not
whether the Chife Prieste in all the world
were at Rome, but, whether the first Priest
in al the world began at Rome.
                  Craft in chainging and interpreting. Betwene
which two propositions, there is a great
difference.
               But what sayth M. Iewel to these
wordes, Vnde vnitas Sacerdotalis exorta

               What Impudencie then is it in M.
Iewel, for that these words seme to weigh
much, to bring furth the Iudgement of
Polidore, a man that may seme to be Indifferent,
                  impudēcie
whereas they are not at all in
Polidore? Polidorus Virgilius (saieth he)
expoūdeth the same words of S. Cyprian.
Dare ye say he expoundeth them, whereas
he hath not them? He bringeth in S.
Cyprian, to proue that the See of S.

Peter was principal, but, of Vnitas Sacerdotalis,
the vnitie of Priesthood, Upon
which wordes, you made hast to shewe
his exposition, he maketh no mention.
He saieth in his owne wordes, not in S.
Cyprians, that the order of Priesthood can not
be sated to haue grovven first from the Bishope
of Rome, onlesse vve vnderstand it only by Italie,
for Priesthood was rightly instituted at Hierusalem
but that the Commendation geauen
by S. Cyprian to the Church of Rome was
geauen in respect only of Italy, and not in
respect of the whole world, he saied it not,
nor intended it.
               The Order also of Priesthood, and
vnitie of Priesthood are two thinges. In
the Order, is considered, the Author and
effect of that Sacrament: In the Unitie
is considered, the preseruation and Gouernement
of that Order. Of the Order
it selfe, and where Priesthod first began,
Polidore doth speake. Of the vnity,
and of the Relation which all Priestes
should haue to their chiefe head and Gouernour,
S. Cyprian doth speake, and
Polidore saieth nothing. The Order
began at Dierusalem and not at Rome.

The vnity, I wil not say begā at Rome,
but after y• s. Peter had by his martyrdō
there takē ful possession of that See, then
was it seen, where the Principal Church
in al the world was, and to what begynning
al thinges should be referred, and
in what vnitie they should be preserued.
               Hath not M. Iewel, then, done very
sincerely, to allege Polidore, so farre
and wyde from the meaning of Polidor?
I would there were some man so indifferent,
as M. Iewel taketh Polidore to
be, to Iudge betwene hym and vs, whether
he hath not shamefully abused the
Later writers.
            
            
               Of M. Iewels Contradictions.
               HYtherto, by many Examples I
haue proued it, y• M. Iewel hath
not vnderstanded other men: now
wil I shew it, by a fewe Arguments,
that he doth not wel vnderstand
hymselfe. And no maruel truly, if in

bound to his Example, because he
hath commaunded vs so to doe.
               Here in this place (M. Iewel) you
are of the mynd that there is a difference,Ra.
betwene the Institution of Christ, and the
Example of Christ. Otherwise your
saying were very folishe, As by which
this only is imported, that, it were no
part o

                      Christs Institutiō, yet are we neuerthelesse

bound to his Institution. Which
maketh a plaine contradiction, if that by
Institution and Example, you meane but
one thing. An other thing that I
note here, is, that you say, we are bound
to Christes Example, although the thing
which is to be done, were not of his Institution.
               What say ye then, to washing of feete,
for which you haue the expresse words of
our Sauiour in the Gospel?

                  If I (sayth
he) your Lord and Master haue vvashed your
feete, you also ought to vvash one the others feete.
For I haue geauen an Example vnto you, that as
I haue done, so likevvyse that ye also doe. What
say you then (M. Iewel) to this example
of our Sauiour? shal it be folowed, or
no? You Answer,
               That this Obiection of washing of
feete is common,Iew. 116. and hath ben often Answered.
And in the same page. The wasshing
of feete, was neither Institution of
Christ,We are not bound to the exā

Specially apointed to be done by the Apostles,
nor the breache thereof euer deemed

here you make, that Christ apointed not

labour with al your wit, to proue, that ye
are bound to keepe y• Example of Christ.
Reconcile me then (I praie you) these
two places, And tel vs how it may stand
togeather, that we are boūd to Christs example,
in that which is not of the Substance
of Christs Institution, And yet that
you may freely (as ye do) let go washing
of feete in your Congregation, because it
was not Christes Institution?
               
               In the Primitiue church,Iew. 31. this order (of
sending the Sacramēt to them that were
departing this world) was thought expedient

the Priest may carie the Sacramēt home
to the houses of Christians, as it is, at
this present, vsed in the catholike church,
And that they may with good Conscience
receaue it. But let this be referred to the

Melanchthon and Bucer accompted
the receiuing in one or both
kindes a thing indifferent. M. Iewel
answereth:
                  Iew. 110.
               
               Thus farre furth their desire was, it might
be iudged free, not that thei thought Christ
had not ordeined the Sacrament to be ministred
vnto the people in both kindes,Not indifferent. or
that in itselfe it is Indifferent,Indifferēt but that the
Faithful of God might indifferently and
freely vse it without controlment.
               These wordes neede A Reconciliation,Ra.
to bring them at one togeather.
For if the receiuing in both kinds be not
in it selfe Indifferent, how may the faithful
of God indifferently vse it? And if they
may Indifferently vse it, how it is not Indifferent?
               Note also the Crafte or blindnes of
M. Iewel. He Interpreteth Melanchthon
and Bucer, in suche sorte, as if the
question had ben, Whether the people
might not choose, whether they would receaue
in both kindes,M. Iewels priuat comment vpon Melancthon & Bucer. or not receaue at all.
And he maketh them to answer, that they
wishe it to be free and Indifferent, to Receaue
in both if they wil. But the question

in deede, is of Receauing in both
kinds, or in one: And they Answer, that it
is a thing Indifferent. And what is y•
to say? Whether that it should be free for
the people to Receaue in both? Yea truly
this is one part of the sense. But another
is, that it should be as free, for them that
would, to receaue in one also.
               
               For the two pointes, betwene which
the Indifferencie goeth, are, to receaue in
one kind, Or to receaue in both, without
controlment. Which being graunted to
the Protestamts, they should not inueigh

wordes?

                  You Answer: His purpose was

to rebuke the negligence of the people, for
that in so populous a Citie, thei came to the
holy Communion in so smal companies,
which companies, he, in a vehemencie of
speach, by an exaggeration,It may be general although it include not euery particular in respect of the
whole, calleth NO BODY. The like
maner of Speach, is vsed also sometimes in
the Scriptures. S. Iohn saith of Christe,
Testimoniūeius nemo accipit, not for that
no body at al receiued his witnesse (for his
Disciples and many other receiued it) but
for that of a great multitude, very few receiued
it. In like Phrase Chrysostom him
selfe saith other where, Nemo diuina sapit,
No Body sauoreth Godly thinges.
               These be your owne wordes, M.
Iewel,Ra. & whose were those other, where
you said: How can it be a General, onlesse
it include euery Particular?
                  Iew. 162 Be not these
also yours? How make you then, both
to agree togeather? For NO BODY
importeth an vniuersal and general Negatiue,
and then by your very homly and
home made Logique, it includeth euery
Particular.

the English Nation from their grosse
Idolatrie, wherein he had no great trauaile
(for perchaunce it is an easie mater to cō
                  uert
Countries) Yet it is certaine he planted
not Religion in this Realme.
               
               What did he then vnto them whomRa.
he withdrew from their Idolatrie? Did he
leaue them without a Religion? Did he
pul their olde Cote from them, and geue
them no newe? He Baptised at one
Christmasse,Greg. lib. 7 ep. 30. 
                  more than ten thousand English
men, as S. Gregorie witnesseth. And before
he baptised them, did he not plante
Religion in theyr hartes? Otherwyse
how is it credible, that euer they would
haue come to Baptisme? Yet I note
this place, not for the open lie, which is
in it, but for the Contradiction, for that
it seemeth impossible, y• a Nation should

be cōuerted from Idolatrie, and yet not
turned to Religion, whereas, the very
Conuersion it selfe, doth import a forsaking
of one mind and taking of an other.
And no Heretikes haue power to turne
Nations, and the Catholiques to whom
God geaueth that Grace, do for that end
tourne them from Idolatrie, that afterwardes
they may become Christians.
Which End if they be not brought vnto,
Who can say that they are conuerted?

               Verely Iustinian him selfe writing vnto
Epiphanius the Bishop of Constantinople,

               Whom then da you folow, the Pope
or the Emperour▪ S. Bregorie, or Iustinian?
ye folow both, and ye are contrary
vnto your selfe, at one time defying
the Title, at an other, alleaging it.
               Certainly Balaam,Iew. 274 For the cuil life sake of the preachers notwithstanding
he were a False Prophete, yet he opened
his mouth and Blessed the people of God:
Cayphas, although he were a wicked Bisshop,

yet he pphesied and spake the truth:we must not condemne the Lawful doctrine.
A Seale although it: be cast in Leade, yet it
geaueth a perfite Printe. The Scribes and
Phari

                  eis, although they were Hypocrites
and liued not wel, yet they instructed the
Congregation and saied wel.
               By these Examples then it appeareth,Ra▪
                  
that A Doctrine is not to be forsaken,
because of the euil lyfe of the Preacher.
What faulte then is Doctour
Harding in, for saying, that
               Be the Bishoppe of Romes lyfe
neuer so wicked, yet may we not seuer
our selues from the Churche of
Rome?
               For if other causes be alleaged,
wherefore we should do it, they are to be
Aunswered: but this Obiection of the
euil lyfe of the Bishoppes of Rome, is
sufficiently confuted by these Examples
which M. Iewel, here hath clearely allowed.
Yet (see the nature of the man)
when D. Hardinge had saied so much,
he could not abide it, but straitewaies
commeth against it with this Authoritie.
               
                  
How be it, S. Cyprian saith otherwise,Iew. 276 For Y• euel life sake Y• peple must seuer them selues frō their Rulers.
Plebs obsequens, &c. The people obeying
Gods Commaundemēts, must seuer them
selues from the Wicked that ruleth ouer
them.
               S. Cyprian speaketh of Basilides
and Martialis,Ra. Bishops that had defiled
them selues with Libels,Lib. 1. 
                        •
                     p. 4 in which they
gaue their names to Idolatrie. For
which cause, they were excommunicated
of other Bishopes, and the people were
forbid to come to their Sacrifice. But
it is no mater to M. Iewel, how the case
standeth with anie Testimonie, that he
bringeth. So desyrous he is to gaynsaie
D. Harding, that he falleth into Contradictions
with himselfe also▪ speaking at
one time for credite to be geuen to Priestes,
notwithstanding theyr euil life, And
at an other time making it lawful, to forsake
the Doctrine of the Preacher or Ruler,
for because of his euil life.
               When Christ had deliuered both kinds
vnto his Disciples,Iew. 103 The Argument Ab Authoritate negatiue,

But where did Christ euer say, Minister vn

to the people? The like Argument he

maketh. pa. 119. Where did Christ. & caet.
As who should saie, Christ hath not expressed
it, Ergo it is not to be obserued.
               
               Here loe we see, that M. Iewell
aloweth the Argument called in Scholes
Ab Autoritate Negatiue. except you wil say
that him selfe vseth that, which him selfe
alloweth not. But heare now what he
saith in other places of his Replie.
               M. Harding Gheasseth thus It appereth
not by Beda,Iew. 187 The Argument Ab Authoritate negatiue, disproued. the Seruice was in English,
Ergo the Seruice was in Latine.
               What kinde of Logique haue we here?
Or how may this Reason hold? It concludeth

Harding him selfe wil not allow it.
               The Argument in deede he wil not
allow, as you haue made it.Ra. But for
as much as Bede purposely speaketh of
such thinges, as concerned Religion,
It is not to be thought, that he would
haue passed it ouer in Silence, if the
Masse had been translated into the
English tongue.
               
               But how agree you M. Iewel, with
your selfe, that can both refuse and vse,

one and the selfe same kind of Argumēt?
You haue, I trow, some defense for you
selfe in this mater. For you say in an
other place:
               The weight of M. Hardinges Argument,Iew. 126 is taken, as they name it in Scholes,
Ab Autoritate negatiuè, and vnlesse it be
in consideration of some other circumstāce
it is so simple, that a very Child may sone
Answere it.
               What Circumstance then is that,Ra.
which being obserued maketh the Argument
ab Authoritate negatiuè, good? Surely
that Circumstance were wel worth the
learning, that we might perceaue, both,
how to make such Arguments ourselues,
without doubt of your reprehension, and
also howe to warne you thereof, when
yourselfe goe without the Cumpasse of
your owne Circumstance. Perchaunce
you meane hereby not more, but that

               The Lord said Generally vnto Peter feede
my Sheepe, he said not specially feed these
or them: therefore we must vnderstande,
that he committed them vnto Peter altogeather.
               Yet this Argument, is like to that
of S. Paules of SEEDES and SEEDE,
which in deede is notRa.

but Affirmatiuè. For he presseth the
woorde of the Scripture SEEDE, in the

Singular nūber, which to make the better
obserued, he biddeth it to be noted, y•
it was not said, SEEDES. But how
so euer that be, M. Iewels Art may be
wel inough espied, which al at pleasure
affirmeth and denieth, saieth, and vnsayeth,
maketh Rules and Obserueth them
not, and is Contradictorie vnto him self
in very many places.
               This very name,Iew. 306 the HEADE of the
vniuersal Church, is the very thing that we
deny.
               Then are you a very vnwise man,Ra.
to sett the State and Substance of your
question vpon a Name: And to contend
vpon words, affirming them to be the very
thinges. And there appeereth here
vnto me to be a manifest Contradiction,
that the name should be the thing. For
if it were so, that al this writing on both
sides, were no more but an Alteration of
Brammarians or Rhetoricians, then in
deede it might be a questiō, whether this
woorde HEADE were euer Readen in
such a Case, or such an Author, or euer
applied to such and such a person, & then

                     •
                  roprely the Name should be the thing.
               
                  
But now wheras al our cōflict, is about
the Truth of thinges that are to be beleued,
and we seeke not after Termes and
Phrases of Speache, but sense and meaning
of Truthes, And whereas the vnderstanding
(which both partes thinke
to instructe) is not bettered by any
NAMES, but by the very thinges them
selues: It is al togeather vnreasonable,
to say or thinke, that the very name
should be the very thing, emong the Diuines.
               Yet who so considereth diligently,
M. Iewels maner & behauiour of writing,
shal sone perceiue, that he so handeleth
the mater, as though he were a
Grammarian onely, or a Rhethorician,
and not a Diuine, and as though in dede
he passed not vpon the very Thinges, so
that he might haue the very wordes that
could serue his turne. For which cause
he hath furnished himself with Testimonies

largely alleged by D. Harding, and folowed
so Immediatly, in the 14. Diuision,
but that, he knew not wel what to say
vnto it.
               After this maner, it were easie to
finde moe places, and them of no small
weight, which should declare M. Iewel,
for al his fayre shewe of an Absolute Replie,
not to haue touched yet many principall

               This for an Example is inough. For if a man were so disposed, to spend long time in examining of this one Point, Whether M Iesels great & ful stuffed Reply, cam īmediatli frō his own singular Inuētion & diligēce, or no:
                  
there is no dout, but he hath either none
at al, or very few Argumentes & Authorities,
which are not to be sonnde also in
other that haue writen before him. Especially
if it shal be rightly considered, how
much Peter Martyr, Caluine, and the
Magdeburgenses onely (to lette other
s
                     •
                  rapers passe) haue writen against y• Catholik
Church, euen vpō these very 
                     ••
                  estions
which M. Iewel hath proponed.
               Yet I thinke not, that al that he hath
gathered, hath com out of them, although
it may be founde in them also (for why
may not an Englishe Protestaut, be as
sone taken vp, to serue the Diuel in setting
surth of Heresies, and to Receiue
secrete Intelligence from him, what he
shal study vppon, and marke especially,
as any Heretique of beyond the Seas?)
And if it were gathered out of them, I
would not Obiect it vnto him, as one of
the Deadly sinnes for which men should
BEVVARE of him. For emong friends
al thinges are common, and no man that
wise is and honest, writeth to make him
selfe a name in the world, but to help the
common cause, for which him selfe, with
other, standeth.
               
                  
But this much onely I note,Plucke out the beame out of your owne eye. that
such as seke very egrely and impotently,
to hurt the Catholikes estimation by it,
in telling them that they are Borowers,
may vnderstand, that the same Obiection
(if it be any thing worth) may be easily
returned backe vpon them againe.
               In making of which, I thinke in
dede,M. Nowel no borower, for none so 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   that the Author thereof was no borower,
although there hath bene already
so much inuented and imagined agaynst
Catholikes, as more, by any occasion,
could not be vttered. Let him therefore
alone haue the praise of it, for deuising &
mainteining so vnsensible an Obiection,
as neither hath bene vsed of former Heretikes,
though they sought all meanes
how to deface vs, neither can be reprochful
vnto the Catholikes, which knowe
that nothing is newe vnder the Sonne,
And, that al Scriptures, and Docto
                     •
                  rs,
and Writers are oures, which make for
the Defense or Sense of the true Faith.
               Unto your charge therefore, M.
Iewel, I doe not laye it, whether you
haue taken out of the M
                     •

and your Refusing of the Authorities
within the same yeares, And with your
Excoursing into al Ages for witnesses.

might be taken for no great Iewel when
al is knowen.
