                     To the moſt High and mighty Princeſſe Elizabeth, by the grace of God Queene of England, Fraunce and Ireland, defendres of the Faith, &c.
                  
                     YOur Souldiour, (most excellent Princeſſe,) hauing receiued ſo manie gratious wordes for other of his writinges, the which it hath pleaſed your Maieſty ſo fauorably to vouchſafe, is not therby onely incouraged, now once againe to betake him to his Penne, but alſo he is imboldned to preſent to your gratious viewe, this litle labour, containing A Path-way to Military Practiſe. The title beſt befitting to come from a Souldiour, yet the circumſtaunces not vnneceſſarie to bee conſidered of, by ſuch as be in authoritie.
                  
                  
                     And although I knowe the greateſt number (which can not abide to here of warres) are as vnwilling to admit of any thinge appertaining to Martiality when they haue ſo longe continued in Peace, yet as in the time of warre, circumſpect care of peace may not be omitted, ſo in the time of peace, ſuch thinges muſt bee foreſeene appertaininge to the wrrre, that the want of warlike prouiiſons, bee not preiudiciall to this ſweete
                     
and quiet peace, for as Valerius Maximus faith, the cuſtodie of bleſſed Peace conſiſteth in the knowledge of VVarre: Plato praiſing the Arte, commaundeth that children should learne it ſo ſoone as they were of abilitie, Cirus ſayd it was as neceſſarie as huſbandriē, Auguſtine and Barnarde, both Catholique doctours of the Church doo approoue it.
                  The Romaines appointed a longe and ſpacious field which they called Campus Martius, wherein they exerciſed their youth in the knowledge of Martiall feates: They likewiſe inuented glorious triumphes, which was to no other ende but to ſtirre vp the minds of their people to magnanimitie and martiall exerciſes. Cambiſes the father of Cyrus being asked by what meanes countries might beſt be kept in ſafety, aunſwered. If the gouernours of the ſame countries, thinkes they can neuer bee warie inough of their enemies.
                  
                  And although Salomon, (who in the holy ſcriptures is called Rex Pacificus) beeing promiſed by the mouth of God a peaceable raigne, and was ſtill buſied in the building of the holie temple, forgat not yet to furnishe himſelfe more strongly with all manner of warlike prouiſions, then his father Dauid had done before him, notwithstanding he was ſtill exerciſed and buſied in the warres
                  Here I could alleadge infinite examples, and as manie probable reaſons might be geathered, all in defence of martiall practiſe, for he that taketh away the knowledge of feates of armes, worketh the ouerthrowe of his

owne countrey and common wealth: And as by the knowledge of warre and exerciſe of armes, Empires haue beene purchaſed, Kingdomes enlarged, Princes preſerued, Iustice maintained, good Lawes protected, and the Common wealth defended, ſo in neglectinge martiall exerciſes and laying aſide of their weapons, how many kingdomes hath beene brought to calamitie, howe many countries ruinated, and howe many florishinge Citties ſacked, beaten flatte to the ground, couered ouer with moulde, and almost worne out of memorie. But as your maieſty, hauing moſt prouidentlie furnished euery parte of your Realme, withall manner of warlike prouiſion, in ſuch ſorte, as none of your predeceſſours hath euer heeretofore come neere, ſo could I wishe, that in England wee were as well furnished, with practiſed Souldiours and expert warriours, although I doo not meane, that they should bee warre loouers.
                  And as it is moſt apparaunt, that the regarde your maieſtie haue had (euen ſith you firſt became our ſoueraigne) in all manner your princely proceedinges, hath ſo wonderfully bleſſed your eſtate, that all Chriſtian Princes doo honour and renowne you, ſo wee your loouinge ſubiectes (feeling the benefit of your peaceable gouernement) haue no leſſe cauſe to giue God all honour and glory, and daily to pray for the longe continuaunce of ſo gracious a princeſſe. And as it hath pleaſed God, ſo wonderfully to defende your maieſty, from ſuch ſeueral practiſes, intended against your roiall perſon by Papiſtes, let their treaſons (moſt humbly I beſeeche

you) be made examples (aſwell for your owne ſafetie, as alſo for the benefit of the whole common wealth of England) whom your maieſty may hereafter trust.
                  Theſe be the men (O moſt gratious Princeſſe) that he ſworn your mortal enimies, theſe be the men, O noble England that ſeekes thy wracke & ouerthrow: Let thē haue no gouernement within your maiesties dominions, let them beare no ſway in any part of your territories: Plucke him from the bench though he ſit robed in purple, diſmiſse him the barre, though he be called Sergiant at the Law, put him out of comiſſion, though hebeare the name of Iustice of Peace: pardō me (most gracious Princeſſe) in diſcharging my dutie, though ſimplie yet truely, Souldiours are but blunte, but ſure they looue plainnes.
                  Thus deſiringe God most earneſtly and according to my duety, that as he hath hether to wonderfullie preſerued you in moſt magnificent and Princely regality, (in diſpite of all the enterpriſes and practiſes of traiterours Papiſtes) ſo he would continue your maiesty longe to raigne ouer vs, to the great comfort of all your loouing ſubiectes, and for the proſperity and flourishing eſtate of the common wealth of England.
                  
                     Your Maieſties Souldiour moſt humble and dutifull to bee commaunded: Barnabe Riche.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     ❧ To the moſt noble Captaines and renowmed Souldiours of England, health to their perſons, and happines to all their honourable attemptes.
                  
                     
                        ALthough I haue vndertaken (honorable gentlemen) to ſet down directions for younge Souldiours not yet fully perfected in Militarie Practiſe, yet for the better experienced (of whō my ſelfe would gladly be inſtructed) as I haue not preſumed to offer them preſcriptions, ſo I hope they haue no cauſe to miſlike of this mine enterpriſe. It is now 24. yeres agoe, ſith I firſt vndertooke Armes & ſerued at New hauen, vnder that moſt honorable Earle of VVarwicke (a father to Souldiours at this day) ſithe which time, what I haue either practiſed by experience, ſeene by example, or gathered by Hiſtorie concerning Martiality, I haue here ſet them downe, to the benefit of my countrie men, that are not yet practiled in ſo honourable and exerciſe, what faultes I ſhall commit through ignoraunce. I hope you will pardon of curtelie, when they ſhall proceede rather of the zeale I haue to pleaſe, then of any deſire I haue to offend: thus ſubmiting altogether to your diſcreete corrections, I ende.
                  
                     Yours as his owne, Barnabe Rich.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                  To the freendly Readers in generall, Barnabe Riche Souldiour, ſendeth greeting.
                  
                     
                        IT may be (freendlie Reader) that thou wilt thinke my labour might very well haue beene ſpared to write of any thing appertaininge to warres where euery man is deſirous to liue in peace, I knowe will rather purchaſe diſlike then win mee looue, yet as I am not ignorant, that quiet peace is to be preferred before bloody warre, ſo in the time of peace, warlike diſciplines muſt not be omitted in a well gouerned common wealth, where ſo many euill neighbours are ſo readie to incroch but eſpecially when both Prince, Countrie, religion, lawe, iuſtice, ſubiectes and altogether are vnder the protection of armes.
                  VVhere is become the dominions of the Aſſirians, Perſians and Grecians, or what is become of the glory of that learned Citty of Athens, or what hath waſted the renowne of the Cittie of Rome that it had not beene perpetuall, but onely when in the time of peace, they fell to inordinate ryot and delicacie, neglecting the feates of war, laying aſide their armes and weapons: For to doubt and feare

nothing was more hurtfull to common weales, then their very neighbour enimies, the feare of whome was their ſafety and aſſuraunce. For this cauſe Scipio though it vnneceſſary that Carthage ſhould vtterly be deſtroyed, fearing that after the ſubuerſion, the Romaines leauing of their martiall mindes ſhould fall to idlenes, ryot and outrage, and as he looked for ſo it came to paſſe, as it was teſtified after by Saint Auguſtine, who in a booke which he had written intituled, De ciuitate Dei, hath theſe wordes.
                  
                     More hurtefull was the Citty of Carthage to Rome after hys diſtruction, then duringe the whole courſe & ſeaſon of the warres whych the Romanes had wyth her, for that whyleſt they had enemyes in Affricke, they knewe not what vyces meant in Roome. In the time of peace therefore, there muſt be had ſpeciall regarde to the diſciplines of warre, and not onelie prouiſions of warlike furnitures to be made, but alſo men of ſeruice and practiſed Souldiours to be had, releeued, and maintained: for what ſhould you doo with armes, weapons, munitions and furnitures, when you haue not men of experience to vſe them King Phyllyp of Macedon vſed the lyke compariſon to that noble Captaine Antipater in theſe wordes.
                  
                     VVhat, feareſt thou the Cittyzens of Athens, the Gallyes and theyr peere, are but trifles vnto mee, for what account is to be made of thoſe fellowes that giue themſelues to daunſinge, loytring, banqueting and

to belly cheere, but if Demoſtines onely were not amongſt them, I would ſooner make account to winne Athens, then eyther Thebes, or Theſſalia of which I am already poſſeſſed.
                  
                  By theſe premiſſes it may be perceiued that it is the Souldiour, that protecteth the Prince in his ſeate, it is the Souldiour, that defendeth the Diuine in his pulpet, it is the Souldiour, that vpholdeth the Iudge in his place of Iuſtice, it is the Souldiour as Varo ſayth, that reſiſteth the outward force of enemies, that repreſſeth domeſticall ſeditions, and defendeth the libertie of ſubiects: If his ſeruice be then ſo beneficiall to all, O what pitty, he is not better conſidered of by ſome, that are ſo bountiful in rewarding pipers, paraſites, ſingers and dauncers and other like miniſters of their pleaſures, and ſuffer poore Souldiours to begge, and will ſooner affoorde him a payer of ſtockes, then a ſingle pennie for his almes.
                  
                     Epaminondas Captaine generall of the Thebanes, vndeſtanding of a very ritch man that had no care of the poore, ſent a needy ſouldiour vnto him, cō
                     maunding him vnder great penaltie to giue 600▪ crownes to this poore man, this Cittizen receiuing this commaundement, came to knowe the cauſe, it is (quod Epaminōdas becauſe this man being honeſt is poore, and thou which haſt liued by the ſpoyle of the common wealth art ritch. O that our Vſurers in England might ſometime haue ſuch meſſengers ſent vnto them, I thinke

the errande would neither offen de God nor man: Neither can I ſee why there ſhould not be a generall contribution giuen through the realme, for the mayntenaunce of men of warre, when theyr ſeruice concerneth ſuch publique profit: The Prince is not able to recompence all, and the ſouldiour muſt fight in defence of all, why ſhould hee not be maintained by the helpe of all.
                  But here ſome wil think I ſpeake for my ſelfe, & I confeſſe it, ſouldiours muſt learne of other men to ſpeake for them ſelues, for there is no body elſe that will: VVhat trade or handicrafte haue you ſo ſimple, but if it begin a little to decay, but by and by it pleades pouerty, runninge to the Prince or Parliament for releefe, eyther by repelling ſome ſtatute, by making ſome priuiledge, or by attayning ſome conſideration: And if vppon any occaſion betweene Nations trafique be ſtopte, howe clamerous is the Marchaunt in the eares of hys Prynce, till hee hath his paſſage againe freely ſet open:
                  The Lawyer will permitte no Edicte to come forth that makes againſt his owne profit, though otherwiſe it be beneficial for the whole common wealth: The Deuine findes fault that their ſpirituall promotiones ſhould ſo many wayes bee bereaued them, and (I thinke) complaineth of it not without ſome cauſe: If euery profeſſion hauelybertie to ſay for them ſelues, giue ſouldiours leaue to ſpeake, when by the vnkindnes of their countrimen

they are brought to the worſt, and yet as profitable members to their common wealth, as they that thinkes them ſelues beſt: Is it not the Souldiour by haſarding his life abroade, that vpholdeth the Artificer to ſit quietly by his worke at home. And what would it auaile the Marchaunt to ſpeake for forraine gaine, if the ſouldiour were not to defende him from domeſticall ſpoyle. The Lawyer makes no plea but for priuat profitte, and burldes goodly houſes, and purchaſeth whole countries about him.
                  The ſouldiour ſerues his countrye for a ſmall ſtypende, and would be contended with alowance but to buie meate, drinke, and cloath: And that very religion which the deuine but coates downe in his quiet ſtudie without any perill, that very religion the ſouldiour maintaineth with the loſſe of limme and life. How much more might heere be alleadged in the behalfe of ſouldiours and their ſeruice, yet theſe be they that the politique wyſe man (him I meane) (that is better practiſed in Machauils policies, then ſtudied in the new Teſtament) would haue to be kept vnder. But leauing prophane hiſtories, out of the which great volums might be writtē, haue we not examples out of the holy Scriptures, howe valiant mindes haue beene rewarded, and men of ſeruice liberallie gratified: in the 14. Chapter of the booke of Numbers. Caleb was promiſed reward by Gods owne mouth for his owne conſtancie and couragious perſwaſion

to the children of Iſraell: The ſame Caleb to gratifie Othuiel his brothers ſonne, for takinge the Cittie Cariathe, beſtowed of him his faier daughter Athſah: Dauid likewiſe receiued great ritches with the daughter of King Saule, for killing Goliah: Dauid him ſelfe promiſed great rewardes to ſuch as ſhould ouerthrowe the Iebuſits, and Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach ſayth: There be two thinges that greeue my hart, and in the thyrd is a diſpleaſure come vpon mee, when an expert man of warre ſuffereth ſcarſenes and pouerty, when men of vnderſtanding and wyſedome are not ſet by, and whē one departes from righteouſnes to ſinne.
                  
                  But is not that countrie to much vngratefull which hath no manner of remorſe to thoſe men whoſe blood hath ſcarletted the grownd ſo much to their glory, and no leſſe to their preſeruation: If ſouldiours muſt be had (as of neceſſity they muſt) how would you haue them liue, wyll you ſette downe no courſe: Giue me leaue then to ſay my minde I ſpeake but in ſporte, but that it might come to paſſe I would wiſh in good earneſt. Leauing many preſidentes, let vs fetch our example from the people of the lowe Countries, who beeing generally giuen to drunkennes, hath ſuch an exciſe impoſed both of Beere and VVine, that it well neere ſuffiſeth to pay all their ſouldiours during the time of the ciuill warres.
                  Now our people of England being as generallie giuen to inordinate lawing, if the like impoſition

might be rayſed for euery action they ſhould commence, for euery writte they ſhould fetche foorth, and for euery ſentence in lawe that ſhould be pronounced with them both, or againſt them, no doubt it would maintaine a great many of ſouldiours to grade them, whereby they might the more ſafely follow theyr lawe, and when they had ſpent all amongſt Lawyers (as a number of them already hath doone) they might haue ſome cullour to craue gratification from the Prince or Country for theyr good ſeruice, as if you will beare with me, I will ſhewe you the like preſident. About tenne yeeres agoe, (vpon occaſion) beinge in Hollande at a towne called Gorcum, a good fellow comming to the States, craued of them ſome recompence, for his indeuours, which (as he ſayd) had beene wonderfully beneficial to their ſtate and gouernement.
                  The States willing him to make repition of his ſeruice, and he ſhould finde them ready to conſider of good deſert, this good fellow then ſo well incouraged beginnes his tale.
                  It is not vnknowen (quod he) that within theſe ſeauen yeeres, I was worth 4000. Guilders, ſithe which time vntill this preſent (ſo longe as I had one ſtiuer left) I am ſure there is no man that euer ſawe me goe ſober to bed: Now gentlemen, if you will wiſely conſider of this, how beneficiall my drinking hath beene to your common purſe of excyſe, and not onely what my ſelfe haue ſpent of

mine owne, but alſo by my drawing in of many other good drinkers in my company, I doubt not but as you muſt confeſſe I haue beene a good member to my commen wealth, ſo you will not fayle to gratifie me, according to my deſert.
                  Now, if the like exciſe were ſette of the Lawe, why might not a fellowe that had beggerd him ſelfe by lawing, craue like conſideration, and by as good deſert: I ſpeake not againſt the triall for title of landes, which I knowe muſt be decided by the verdit of a Queſt, or the diſcretion of a Iudge, but I ſpeake againſt theſe vnkindly Actions of Treſpaſſe, commonly commenced for the ſpeakinge of a word, for a neighbours gooſe that ſhall but looke ouer a hedge, and for other ſuch like occaſions, wherein they will not ſticke to ſpende more poundes, then for the releefe of a ſouldiour, or defence of their countrye they are willinge to giue pence. But as it is neceſſary ſuch clyentes ſhould be a little wronge by the purſes, ſo ſuch counſaylers ſhould not goe ſcotfree, that are the annimaters to ſuch cauſes. I remember longe ſithens, (when I was a little bookiſhe,) I reade a Hiſtory in our Engliſh Chronicles, and although I canne not ſet you downe the place, yet as I can I will tell you the matter.
                  A Prince of this realme (vpon what occaſion I knowe not) fined all the Lawiers of this lande, for their extortion bryberie and deceite, but to one amongſt the reſt, that was found to be vncorrupted

there was giuen 300 pounds. If it pleaſed her maieſty to followe this example, and to fine euery Lawyer but at tenne pound, that hath cozoned his countrimen at the leaſt of renſcoore, to them that ſhal be found free from corruption, ſhe might double her beneuolence and make the three hundred pound 600. in Gods name, and yet ſaue an honeſt portion for the maintenaunce of her wars: It was ſometime though that one Lawyer, and one Goſſehauke were enough in a whole ſhyre, and as Plato concludeth, it is a token of a corrupted eſtate, where there are many Lawyers, and manie Phiſitions, becauſe the multitude of Lawyers are maintained by the contention of people, and ſuch ſtore of Phiſitions, by their exceſſe in dyet, drunkennes and gluttonie. But pardon me here I praie you, the tellinge of a merry tale that comes but nowe ſodainelye in my minde, and thus at followeth.
                  There was ſometime a Lawyer dwelling farre in the North that had ſerued a writ of a poore Cumberland man, for his appearaunce at VVeſtminſter in the beginning of the next Terme, this poore mā for want of a horſe comming to London on foot, and by the way as he paſſed, where he ſawe a ſigne he was ſure to finde meate, drinke, and lodging for his money, but comming to London, and by fortune hitting into Holburne, ſeeing a ſigne at euery mans doore, began to make doubte, and callinge to a Boye that paſſed by, aſked him where hee

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
might finde an Inne, the Boy (diſpoſed to play the wagge) pointes him to one of the Innes of Court, the poore fellow going in, and ſeeing many Tables couered in the Hall (for it was almoſt dinner time) thought with him ſelfe there was good cheere towardes, walkes vppe and downe, till the gentlemen came in, and ſitting downe, he fell in amongſt them to the Table, the Steward (who to ſee good orders) perceiuing one without a gowne and a cappe, comes to him and telles him howe that was no place for him, and willes him to ariſe, the poore man aunſwers him, gude fellowe I ha ſiller in my purſe ayſe pay for what I take, but the Steward ſeeing his ſimplicite and how he was deceiued, aunſwers him againe, my freend this is no place for you to ſpend your ſiller in, this is for gentlemen Lawyers, and there comes no other here but ſuch the poore fellow heering his words aroſe from the boorde, and in a great chafe aunſwereth thus.
                  Now the foule ill tae them, be all thure lawyers, marry had I kende that, I had rather haue eate no breade theſe two daies, then haue come amonge ſayke a company; thus as he was haſtily goinge forth of the doores, the gentlemen ſporting at his folly, followed him laughing, which when he perceiued, calling to the porter he ſayd, ay ſay, my gude fellowe ſlot to the doore, by the bread a gad and all thure may once breake out, there is neere a poore man in England that ſhall liue in whayet

by them. Now here letting ſlippe the ſimplicity of a Clowne, let vs returne againe to ſpeake of ſouldiours, who as they are little prouided for in the time of peace, ſo they are as ſmally cared for in the ſeaſon of warre, and this is not a little to bee meruailed at, that when any occaſion of ſeruice dooth happen, ſome bee appointed for Captaines as knowes not how to place 100. men in good order of araye, vnleſſe it be (peraduenture) to marche them 3, or 5. in a rancke, as they vſe to fetch home a may pole.
                  VVee doo finde in the holy ſcriptures and that in ſeuerall places, both in the bookes of Moyſes, in the booke of Ioſua and others, where they haue vſed not litle regard aſwell in the choſing of their Captaines, leaders and conductors, as alſo in preſcribing lawes and diſciplines of warre, which ſometimes were appointed by the almighty God him ſelfe: Phillip King of Macedonia, did meruaile why the Athenians did euerye yeere chooſe newe Generalles and Captaines of the wars, when he him ſelfe had found but one good, namely Permenyo: Alexander admitted none to the roome of a Captaine vnder the age of 60.
                  But in England, wee neuer number his yeeres, we neither conſider his knowledg, we little regard his worthines, we leſſe eſteeme his experience, wee ſcarce examine his honeſtye: Our Captaines are appointed, more for fauour then for knowledge, more for feendſhippe then for experience,

more for opinion then for deſert: God graunt wee neuer come to make triall of the ſeruice of ſuche Captaines as I haue ſeene ſome, if wee ſhould, there were great feare of vnhappy ſucceſſe.
                  And this is to bee lamented amongſt vs, that wee can bee ſo prouident in matters of no importaunce, and ſuch cauſes where in our owne ſafeties dooth eſpecially conſiſt, wee eyther neglect them altogether, or elſe performe them with little care and leſſe foreſight. If the matter were well examined we ſhould finde that the ſafety both of Prince ſtate, country, ſubiects, and altogether conſiſted in the worthines of the Captaine: and to this moſt fitly agreed the ſaying of that noble ſouldiour Sir VVylliam Drury, who many times woulde vſe theſe wordes.
                  The want of a horſſe ſhooe nayle, may bee the loſſe of the ſhooe, the loſſe of the ſhooe, the ſpoile of the horſſe, the ſpoyle of the horſſe, the loſſe of the man: the loſſe of a man, the ouerthrowe of an army: the ouerthrowe of an army, the loſſe of a Princes crowne: If ſmall thinges thus by degrees, may conclude ſuche great preiudice in the wynding vppe, (as it can not bee denayde) what ſucceſſe is to be looked for, where captaines and leaders are ſo vtterly ignoraunt, that many of them knowes not when it is time to charge, nere when it were good to retire: and as Socrates ſaith, the boldenes of the ignoraunt ingendreth manye euilles, and Ageſilaus affyrmeth, the lacke of experyence

breedeth the lacke of corage: And as hiſtories make mencion, more feeldes haue beene loſte for wante of gouernement, then for want of ſtrength.
                  To giue a braue charge, is a thing proper to euery ordinarie ſouldiour, but to make a good retreat in time, & in order, therin conſiſteth the ſkill of the Captaine: The vnexpert Captaine, and the vnlearned phiſition, doo buy their experience at to deere a rate, for it is ſtill purchaſed, with the price of mens liues: The place of a Captaine is honourable, and ought not to bee giuen but to men of experience, of valiaunce, and of vertue, and yet I haue heard tell, where they haue beene made marchandyſe of, and bought and ſolde for money, but I dare not ſay that I haue knowen it my ſelfe, for paraduenture I ſhould offend.
                  But I hope ſouldiours ſhall not bee ſtill illegitimate, they ſhall be eſteemed accordinge to deſert. The Deuine for tellinge a learned diſcourſe in a Pulpette is rewarded with a Biſhopricke, and but accordinge as hee is worthy, the Lawyer for makinge a good Plea at the Barre, is brought to the Benche, and it is doone wyth conſideration.
                  The Souldiour that watches, that wardes, that trauelles, that toyles, that makes hys bodye a defence for Cannon ſhotte, and feareth no perrylles for the looue of hys Countrye,

I truſt will be better conſidered of God hath wonderfully bleſſed vs with ſweete and quiet peace but let vs not be ſecure, as though we had it by patten we haue enemies abroade if they had oportunitie, but take heede of papiſtes here at home, they are more to be feared, then hee that was borne in Spayne.
                  
                  Haue they not made ſundry profers to ſtirre vp ſeditious tumultes, nay what doo they leaue vnattempted, to diſturbe this happye gouernement: But would you haue ſome ſpeciall markes howe you may knowe them, then liſten, and by theſe meanes you may eaſely ſmell them out: You ſhall haue them inquiring of newes, ſpreading of rumours, lying, forging, counterfeiting and diſſembling, what action hath there beene ſo honouraly performed, ſithe that noble Earle of Leicester vndertooke theſe lowe country ſeruices, whych hath not beene defaced (heere at home) by our ſlaundering Papiſtes.
                  VVhat good newes hath there come ouer which they haue not paraphraſed, what enterpriſe ſo iuſtly attempted, which they haue not eclipſed, or what exployt ſo brauely accompliſhed, which they haue not methamorphiſed: Such is the deuotion of our religious Catholiques, that they ſtraine no curteſie to forge lyes, to practiſe treaſons, to commit murthers, to ſtirre vppe rebellions, nay what outrage is there ſo miſcheeuous, which they wil not enter into to doo their holy father ſeruice.

Theſe be their workes meritorious which ſo many times they boaſt of, and by this ladder they thinke to clime vp to heauen gates, where ſaint Peter ſtandes watching ready to let them in. O how many vngodly practiſes, haue they intended againſt our moſt gratious princeſſe, how are they continually buſied in conſpiring againſt her: but that almighty God who firſt planted her to their ſubuerſion, hath not fayled ſtill to protect her (no doubt) to their confuſion. VVere not the furie that ouerruleth them more then extreame, they could not be ſuch enemies to their owne diſcretion, but that they might well diſcerne, it is Gods bleſſing, that ſo mightely defendeth her againſt the Popes curſing, and although his holines hath taken great paines, in ſending foorth his Ieſuits, his Seminaries and other his miniſters (from time to time) with ſo many conſpiracies, and ſuch ſeuerall practiſes againſt her maieſty, yet at their departure when they come to craue his fatherlye benediction, (God be thanked) he bleſſeth them al to the gallowes.
                  And although that accidentes are many times ſufficient to ſerue their turne, either to confirme, eyther to confound religion according to the euent, I wonder they cannot aſwell condemne a Papiſt in his ill ſucceſſe that is ſent ouer with ſo many hallowed bulles, as they will doo a proteſtante, for the leaſt miſfortune that may befal him, but if this light were ſufficient for men to iudge

cullours by, who more bleſſed then our gratious Elizabeth who ſo happily hath raigned ouer vs this 28. yeeres, how mightily hath God preſerued her, from the conſpiracies of Popiſh traytors, howe many forraine princes haue ſought to her for ſuccours, that like as auncient Rome (while the gouernement reſted in the ſouldiour) was the verie refuge for ſuch as were diſtreſſed by oppreſſing Tyrantes, ſo the greateſt parte of Chriſtendome, hath thought their ſtates the better aſſured, when they haue combyned with her Maieſtye, and ſhrowded them ſelues vnder her gratious protection, with what peaceable gouernement hath ſhe continued her ſubiectes, how hath England floriſhed ſithe ſhe became our ſoueraigne, what would you more, of her ſelfe ſhe is mercifull, her noble Counſaylers carefull, her loouing ſubiects dutifull, that to conclude, if theſe preſidents be teſtimonies of the looue of God (as without all queſtion they are) then O thrice happy England that dooſt enioy ſo excellent a Princeſſe.
                  Nowe contrary wiſe, let vs but conſider of the Popes beſt belooued the King of Spaine, howe hath he beene ſhaken in the moſt partes of his dominions, his Indies (the fayreſt flower in his Garland) the inhabitantes whereof, are ſo oppreſſed with the tyrannie of the Spaniſh gouernement, that they let not daily to enter into rebellion, ſeeking all meanes to ſhake of that ſeruitude, by reaſon whereof, the great ſummes of treaſure hee

was wont to receiue out of thoſe partes, beginnes to deminiſh, and is like to decreaſe euery day leſſe then other: For the regimentes in Italy, who knowes not how diſcontentedly they endure the Spaniſh gouernement, but the garriſons ſo keepes them vnder, that the poore Italians muſt bee contented for a time to beare the burthen, although it be ſo much againſt their willes.
                  In Spayne it ſelfe, the Goſpell of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt hath taken ſuch effect in the hartes of a multitude, that the King is buſied in nothinge more then in keeping vnder of his Proteſtantes and queſtionles, as it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer it to take rooting, ſo in time it will bring foorth frutes, let my maiſters of the holye houſe looke to it as wiſely as they can.
                  The tyrannie the Spaniardes vſed in the lowe countries, the cauſe of the peoples reuolt, is ſo welknowen to all, as I ſhould but waſte the time to make a new repitition, but this I may not omitte that the King of Spayne (beeing ſo mighty a monarche as they would make him) could not by force of honourable warre, in ſo many yeeres ſubdue the poore prince of Orange, but in the ende ſetting aſide all dignitie, honour and reputation be fitting a King (in moſt ſhamefull and infamous maner) practiſed his death by murther, the mater is ſo freſh in memory, as I neede ſpend no loger time to repeate it: Be theſe the examples of Chriſtian humanitie, nay vndoubted confirmations of Turkyſh

tyranie, but (as they ſay) ſuch Carpenters ſuch chippes, ſuch Saintes, ſuch reliques, ſuch tree ſuch fruite, euen ſo it may be ſayd, ſuch quarrell, ſuch conqueſt, And hath not the Prince of Perma, made the like conqueſt in recoueringe againe of Sutphen Scance, and in taking of Deuentre: the one the Earle of Leycester wonne from him by honourable and braue aſſault, the Prince beeing at at hand with his whole force within the hering of the battery, ſo that it cannot be ſayd it was ſtolne vpon him, Deuentre in like caſe (hanging but in doubtfull Ballaunce) was aſured by the Earle, at that very inſtante whiles hee laye before Sutphen: neyther practiſed by deceipte nor compaſſed by trechery, but perfourmed by honourable polycie, the Prince beeing in the fielde and had continuall intelligence of euery action that was attempted, ſo that it may bee ſayd, euery thing was doone before hys face: But hee taking hys time whyle the Earle was out of the Country, recouered them againe by the lyke ſtratageme, as he vſeth to atrayne the reſt of his conqueſtes, which are euer obtained by tyrrannie, by treaſon, by corruption, by murther, and by ſuch other deuilliſhe practyſes, both deteſtable before God, and diſhonourable amongſt men: but thys is beſt befittinge men of theyr religion, and iumpe correſpondent to theyr holy fathers doctrine.
                  I would nor here bee miſtaken, neyther doo I meane (by any thinge before ſayde) that where a

Prince is perturbed by warre of otherwiſe, that ſuch euentes are for tokens of the diſpleaſure of God towardes him, but this I inferre, that where the cauſe of ſuch troubles doo proceede through hys owne tyrannie, although, I knowe the Pope may well beſtowe his bleſſing in ſuch a cauſe, yet God with his owne mouth hath curſed the crueltie of ſuch oppreſſours, and the executours of ſo notorious outrage.
                  There reſteth nowe no more, but that wee bee prouident for our owne ſafeties, our enemies lookes about, they watche but oportunity, let vs bee as vigillant, leaſt they happe to catche vs napping, the enemie is by no meanes ſooner repulſſed, then when he ſhall perceiue we be already wel prouided for him: wee haue already committed ſome errours and a little troden awrie, we haue let ſlip oportunities, we haue foſtered ſerpents in our owne boſomes, and although they haue bitten vs yet we can not beware, but let vs lament follyes vnder more couert termes, for the worlde is giuen to ſee too much, our cōtinued peace hath bene the nouriſher of many vices, we haue entertained pride newe fangled faſhion, and monſterous atire, what extortion is found to bee in the mighty, what oppreſſion in the wealthy, what vnſariable deſire of hauing, what vnreaſonable practiſe in gettinge. VVhat corruption of ſuch as giue bribes, what perſurie of ſuch as take bribes, what buying of othes in the one, what ſelling of conſcience in the

                     A Path-waie to Militay Practiſe, first of the election and chooſinge a Generall.
                  
                     
                        AS ſweete and quiet peace is the bleſſinge of God, and is eſpecially to be preferred amongeſt true Chriſtians, yet as Cicero ſayeth, wée muſt ſometime take warres in hand, to the ende that wée may the more ſafelye inioye this happye peace, and Verro likewiſe affirmeth, that armes are many times neceſſary, to reſiſte the outward force of enemies, to repreſſe domeſtical ſeditions, and to defend the liberty of ſubiectes: and it is holden for a principle in common policie, that it is better to offende then defend.
                  That Princes in policie ſhoulde vſe all poſſible meanes, for the defence of true religion, for the ſafety of his owne eſtate, for the maintenaunce of his louing ſubiectes, for reſiſting the crueltyTyrantes, is both warranted by the opinion of all politique wryters, and in  of the holy Scriptures, not onelie tolerated, but in manie

places expreſly commaunded. In the 14. of Geneſis Abraham entred into armes for the recouerye of hys brother Lot, in the 31. of Numeri Moyſes is willed to make warres vpon the Madianites, by the expreſſe commaundement of God, Saule in the firſt booke of Kinges the 15. Chapter hath the lyke commaundement, in the book of Iudges Chapter 2. the children of Iſraell were blamed for making of peace with the Cananites: A prince therefore that mindes to enter into armes, is fyrſt to conſider of the equity of his cauſe, then making choyſe of a Generall, ſuch a one as feares God, is likewiſe to fortefie him ſelfe with the goodnes of his quarrell, neither is there any meane more rather to incite men to valiaunce, then when they ſhall remember they goe to the fight in a righteous cauſe, for fortitude euer fighteth for equitie and iuſtice, and valiaunce without iuſtice is to be accounted raſhnes, but euery vertue hath his counterfeite folower, as deceipt ſometime créeping in is called policie, ſo raſhnes ſhrowdeth it ſelfe vnder the title of fortitude.
                  And as Plutarche ſayth, all valiaunt men are hardye but al hardy men not valiaunt: the diſtinction groweth, where men wil oppoſe thē ſelues into perril, ſometime without iuſtice, ſometime without iudgemēt, according to this ſaying of Plato. That not onely the knowledge which is ſeuered from Iuſtice, is rather to be called ſubtiltie then wiſedome, but alſo the courage which is forwarde to daunger with out iudgement and for a common profit, may rather beare the name of lewde hardines then valiaunce.
                  
                  A Generall thus fortefied in his owne conſcience, with the iuſtice of his quarrell, is nowe to ſatiſfie his whole company with the example of his vertue, and as the eye (aboue the reſt of our ſences) is leaſt miſtaken,

and the minde apter to receiue impreſion by what the eye ſéeth, then by that the eare heareth, ſo there is not a more ſpèedy meane, to make inferiours to embrace vertues, then when they ſhall ſée the gouernour or Generall, giue firſt example in his owne perſon. A Generall therefore muſt eſpecially both looue and feare God, he muſt not be without learned Preachers and Miniſters of gods word, which muſt inſtructe and teach the Armie, practiſing them aſwell in the feare of God, as in duety and obedence to theyr Commaunders, Captaines and Officers.
                  In his owne perſon he muſt be magnanimious, curteous, gratious, eaſie to be ſpoken with, conſtant in his counſayles, quicke in his executions, and ſecréete in his determinationes, that his intentes may be kept cloſe. Thus ſhall he be honoured, not for feare of his power, but for the loone of his vertue, the good opinion whereof béeing ſetled in the hartes of his ſouldiours, is of wonderful eficacie, for the accompliſhment of al his attemptes and enterpriſes. When Scipio had vndertaken the ſubuerſion of Carthage, in marchinge on his way towardes the execution, a noble man demaunding of him wherein his hope conſiſted for the performaunce of ſo difficulte an enterpriſe, Scipio aunſwered, in the looue of my Souldiours, which I knowe to bee ſuch towardes me, that if I ſhall bidde them to caſt them ſelues from the height of yonder Rocke, they will not refuſe it, when it ſhall redounde to my honour and reputation.
                  Mercy and Iuſtice in a Generall, be two precious ornamentes, aſwell to winne the looue of his owne people, as to drawe the hartes of his very enemies, and many times haue béene of greater effecte to ſubdue them, then the force and ſtrength of mighty armes:

there is no one thing more requiſit in a General, then a a francke and liberall minde, which maketh a ſouldidiour more profitable to the battell in the day of fight, then a miſerable vnthankfull wretch, with multitudes of treaſure. He muſt be milde, courteous, gentle and louing amongſt his ſouldiours, preferring the ſafety of his owne people before the killing of his enemies: A Generall thus adorned in his owne perſon, is nowe to make choyſe of his counſaile for the warres, his great Officers for the feelde, his Captaines, leaders and conductours of his army.
                  His counſalers ſhould bee men of quicke capacitie, ready witte, and ſound iudgement: and here (accordinge to the minde of the Philoſopher) I would wiſhe a generall ſhould rather be aduiſed by ſuche as looues hym, then by thoſe that are beſt belooued of him ſelfe: the firſt he ſhall fynde faithfull and firme for his honour, the other perhappes may flatter and ſpeake to pleaſe humours. His Officers, Captaines and leaders, muſt bee choſen for vertue, not for oppinion: for knowledge, not for fauour, for experience, not for fréendſhippe. They ſhould not bée men detected with vices, for pride bréeds diſdaine, couetouſnes, extorting bothe of Prince and Souldiour, ſwearing bringeth hatefulnes to all honeſt eares.
                  
                     Cato béeing Cenſurer to make choyſe of a Generall of the Pannonian warres, ſayde with a loude voyce that hée woulde dyſmiſſe Publius, becauſe hée had ſéene him walke the ſtréetes of Rome perfumed, but in my oppinion it is a preſident of ſome errour, to ſée a Captayne that ſhall goe all to bée guilded, and to ſée hys poore Souldiours followe, with neyther Hoſe to theyr legges nor Shooes to their féete.
                  Good perſwaſion, and to knowe howe to ſpeake wel

is a moſt neceſſary vertue both in Generall, Officer and Captaine, ſome time by oration to adde incouragement to theyr Souldiours, ſome time it containeth them in order and diſeipline, and many times it more preuaileth to bringe the enemy to compoſition and agreement, then their ſquadrons and troupes were able to winne by force.
                  
                     Cineas, by the excellencie of his oraforie, brought more townes in ſubiection is his maiſter Phyiihus by his tongue, then Phyiihus him ſelfe could do by his valour. Generalles are now to prouide for all manner of warlike munitions and prouiſions, both offenciue and defeneiue, aſwell for the féelde as the towne: he muſt be prepared of pay, of victuall, artilerie for all pur poſes, of poulder and ſhorte, as well for the Cannon as the Caliuer, of match, of armour, of weapons, of cariages, of all manner of tooles, for cutting, frenching, mining, ſcalinge, fortefying, al theſe and many furnitures about the Ordenaunce, and belonging to the charge of the maiſter of the Ordenaunce, the Generall muſt firſt prouide for, and that in ſuch ſorte, as when he ſhall thinke hym ſelfe to bee beſt furniſhed, yet to haue care of the time that is to come: hee muſt bée furniſhed with Inginers, Armourers, Carpenters, Smithes, Maſons and Pyoners.
                  But a Generall muſt eſpecially bée well prouided for the payment of his retinewe, for the want of paye, dooth not onely infeeble and abate the courage of ſouldyours, when they ſhal be pincht both with hunger and colde, but it breedeth mutinies, it cauſeth dyſorders, it neglecteth ſeruice, and lettes ſlip oportunities. To ſet downe in particulers what great preiudice hath happened for want of paye in ſeuerall armies, would aſke longer diſcourſe then were requiſite in

this place to ſtay vpon.
                  There is nothing that better maintaineth diſcipline amongſt ſouldiours, then to ſée them well payd and to haue them well puniſhed, and I dare vndertake that where a Prince hath occaſiō of ſeruice, 10000. men that ſhould be truely and duely payde, ſhould bee able to doo more and better ſeruice then 30000. as I haue ſéen, for want of pay ſcarce able to goe of theyr legges. A generall therefore that would expecte the regarde, dutie, obedience, & looue of hys ſouldiours, muſt ſée them well payde, ſo ſhall his preſcriptions, orders and diſciplines bée inuoyolably kept, him ſelfe duely honoured, and hys ſouldiours able to ſerue: héere might much more be ſaid of a Generall touching his eperience, learning, and knowledge of Artes, behouefull for many purpoſes, but this may ſuffiſe, and a generall thus appointed as I haue ſayd, ſhall be both honoured, looued, followed and ſerued.

The highe Marſhall is to appoint the camping place, where in he muſt haue this ordinarie conſideration, for woode, water and forrage. He is to quarter the campe, aſſigninge to the quarter Maiſter where the regimentes of footemen ſhall bee lodged, and where the horſemen

ſhall like wiſe haue theyr places: He muſt appoint the watche, and ſurueying the places of greateſt perill, he muſt giue order to his inferiour Officers to haue them furniſht with requiſite guard, directing the ſcout to places of moſt conuenience.
                     The order that is obſerued in the Lowe Countries, where the Sentinel is reléeued by the Corps de gward, euery two howres, is both better and eaſier, then where they vſe to make them ſtand the whole night. When the Campe ſhall remooue, hee is firſt to appointe the Scoute Maiſter to ſende out diſcouerours which waie the armie muſt paſſe, that muſt wearely ſuruey ſtraightes, copſes, and all places fitte to hide ambuſhmentes, and accordinge as they finde occaſion, ſo to giue intelligence. He muſt then ſignifie to the maiſter of the Ordenaunce, and in like manner to the Caryage maiſter, that the artilerie, munitions, and all other carriages may be made readie and ſet forwardes. He muſt then giue order to the Sargiant Maior in what forme he wil haue the battell to march, wherin he hath to conſider both of ſtraightes, and otherwiſe of the nature of his paſſage, aſſigning both guides to conduct them, and Pyoners to mende or make waies for the cariages and armie the eaſier to paſſe.
                     It is not good that an armie ſhould march long iournies, but vpon vrgent occaſion, to the ende they may come timely to theyr lodginges, to builde theyr Cabbens, to fetch in forrage and all manner of neceſſaries. As the Lord high Marſhal in his owne perſon is to determine matters of greateſt importaunce, ſo of neceſcitie hée muſt haue a Prouoſt, with other inferiour miniſters, that muſt likewiſe be ſkilfull in lawes and orders of the fielde, and muſt ſtill be attendaunt in the Campe to decide pettie brables, and ſmall controuerſies

He is to ſée the Campe cleanely kept, neyther anoyed by vnmannerly Slouens that haue no regarde where they eaſe them ſelues, nor by any other filthe or garbege of beaſtes that ſhall happen by butchery, he muſt haue like regarde that the waters be cleane and purely kept, and not onely to forewarne but ſurely to puniſh, as many as ſhall be found offenders in the premiſſes: the watch being ſet, he muſt not

                     THe Generall of the horſemen or Caualary, which hath béene deuided in foure kindes, the firſt men at armes, themſelues armed Complet, and theyr horſes likewiſe barbed, and were to giue the firſt charge to diſorder the ſquadrons or batalions of pikes. The ſecond launces, lighter armed with corſelets, and to breake in with the men at armes where they hadde made way or otherwiſe as they could ſée aduauntage. The thirde light horſemen, commonly armed with a coate of plate with a light ſtaffe charged on the theigh, ſeruing for many purpoſes, as to ſcoute, to diſcouer, to breake foreray, or to followe a chace that is put to a retreat: The fourth and laſt called ſhot on horſebacke, but now lately called Carbines, commonly light horſed without armour ſeruing either with Piſtoll or Petronell: and as the ſhotte one foote béeing charged doo retire for ſuccours to theyr pikes, ſo theſe Carbines may ſkyrmidge looſely and deliuering their volleies, are not able to ſtand any charge but muſt retire to the launce for his ſafety. The Generall of the Horſe hauinge the roles of al the bandes, with the names of their Captaines, is to deuide them ſo equally for euery ſeruice, that ſuch as be imployed in the day muſt be releeued in the night, and thoſe that haue ſerued in the nyght muſt haue reſt in the daye, other wyſe the Horſe wyll

ſo ſodainely be inféebled, that he will be ſeruiceable but a very ſmall time: In the day of fight he is to deuide his companies into winges and troopes, appointinge who ſhall firſt giue charge, who ſhall come to ſeconde them, who ſhall ſtand for reſcues, and thus to directe them, that euery man knowing what he hath to doo, may the rather hope of victory, or at leaſt keepe them ſelues in ſafety.
                     The Generall of Horſe ought to giue warninge through his companies, that they neither diſarme themſelues, neyther vnfadell nor vnbridell their Horſe, tyll the Campe be impalde and ſcoutes put foorth. The Generall of the Horſe, muſt not bee vnprouided of Smithes, Farriers or Horſeleaches, Sadlers, in lyke manner euery Captaine of Horſemen furniſhed in his cariages with Sickles Sithes, Combes, Cordes, Betles, ſtockes, &c. The Generall of the Horſemen may haue his Leiftenaunt, a man ſufficient in ſkill bothe to aſſiſt him in all occaſions, and in his abſence, to commaunde in euery thing with lyke authoritie as his generall might doo, and is called the Lieftenaunte of the Horſe.

                        A Colonell Generall is a place of great authority, and is to commaunde all other Colonelles of foote regimentes, if the Generall ſhall haue occaſion to vſe companies for any ſeruice, the Colonell generall is to appoynte them which they ſhalbe, he muſt therefore haue a role of all the Colonelles and Captaines of euery other regiment, to the ende hée

may order and deuyde them as vpon occaſion he ſhall ſée méete, he is onely to be directed by the Generall or Lord Marſhall, & after they haue determined, he him ſelfe directeth all the reſt. Upon occaſions of ſeruice where honor is to be won, he is to vſe all the regimentes with ſuch indifferency, as they haue no cauſe to grudge or repine.

He is to receiue from the Muſter maiſter the perfect number and true charge both of Horſe men and foote men, and of all the reſt that taketh pay through the whole Campe, then geathering a proportion of the charge as it monthly amounteth vnto, he is to preſent it to the Generall, to the ende hee may make prouiſion for pay accordingly.

                     THis Officer ſhould bee a man of moſt exquiſite knowledge, throughly examined in all manner of fourmes and proportiones of imbatteling, hee

muſt haue the perfect number of euery ſorte of weapon that is brought into the fielde, ſo ſhall he orderly martial them with the quicker expedition & leſſer confu ſion. In the day of fight he muſt haue conſideration to ye nature of the place, and in fourming of his battell take any aduantage that the ground will afforde him. Hée muſt likewiſe conſider of the forces of the enemie, and whether his ſtrength more conſiſteth in Horſe men or in footemen, and as he ſhall finde them prepared, to diſpoſe of his owne order thereafter: and as by aduauntages of groundes many helpes may be taken, ſo in the plaine where there is nothing to truſt but order, I cannot thinke any proportion more defencible againſt both Horſe and foote then the iuſt ſquadron, for that it is ſtronge euery way a like.
                     We haue many fourmes of battell (as hereafter I meane to write on) ſome altogether vnneceſſary, other ſome though very excellent, yet very daungerous to bée ranged before an enemy, where Souldiours are not more excéeding perfect, then commonly we haue them in England. But the iuſt ſquare is a moſt ſure fight, plaine and not curieus in orderinge, and in the plaine fielde as ſeruice holdeth at this day, I know no fourme that may be iuſtly ſayd to better it.

Hée muſt haue knowledge in fortification, to plante his ordenaunce in places of moſt aduauntagè, aſwell for the guarde of the Campe, as to make batterie in beſéeging either Towne or Forte.

ringes as flankers: his greateſt care muſt be ſo to conuey his trenches, eyther before a Towne or Fort that ſhall be beſéeged, that the enemy doo not flanke them, for that the caſtinge and conueying of Trenches orderly, dooth concerne great ſafetie to ſo many as ſhall haue occaſion to paſſe to and fro.

                     THe place of a Colonell is of honourable reputation, and therefore beſides experience, he ſhould be a man of credite and good countenaunce, and as that moſt noble Gentleman, Sir William Ruſſell, (a Parragon of Armes at this day) is many times accuſtomed to ſay, that he which wanteth liberalitie, is poſſeſſed with all the vices in the world, ſo that Colonell that hath not a bountifull minde, and a francke diſpoſition to lende reléefe to a poore diſtreſſed Souldiour, eſpecially of his owne retinue and regiment, is vnworthy to haue the comaunding of men, and not fitte to haue gouernement nor beare office in a Campe.
                     In places where Souldiours are not leuied by the Princes Commiſſion, the generall is to make choyce of his Collonels, men both ſufficient in countenaunce and credyt, for the leuying of ſuch companies as the Generall ſhall commit to his charge, then receiuing his commiſſion with impreſt, the Colonell in like caſe is to make choyſe of his Captaines, impreſting euery of them lykewiſe for the raiſinge of theyr ſeuerall companies.
                     But in England vpon occaſion of ſeruice, Souldiours are euer leuied by the Princes commiſſion, where if ſuch conſideration were had in the chooſinge of them as there ought, it were the more ſafety for the ſeruice, better for the Captaine, and much more beneficiall for the Souldiour, conſidering his furniture is allowed him by the Countrie, which other wiſe is cut of from his pay if hée be not able to furniſh him ſelfe The Colonell hath the commaunding of all ſuch Captaines vnder his

owne regyment to directe vpon any occaſion of ſeruice as hée ſhall ſée good: A Colonell may haue his Liefetenaunt Colonell, his Sarieant Maior, his Prouoſt, and his Quarter maſter, within his owne regyment. A Colonell may correcte miſdemeanours of his Captaines, he may call a Marſhall Courte of his owne officers, for the puniſhing of offences, or for the adminiſtring of Juſtice.
                  
                  
                     ¶ Of a Captaine.
                     THe place of a Captaine is not lightly to be conſidered of, vpon his ſkill and knowledge conſiſteth the ſafety or loſſe of many mens liues, but eſpecially ſeruice ſtanding nowe as it dooth moſt commonly in ſkirmidges, where the Captaine moſt ordenarily is not holpen but with the aduauntage of his own experience.
                     In the olde time many yéeres agoe, when armyes many times vſed to appoint the fielde, where their whole forces were brought to incounter: the weakenes of a Captaine might the better be borne with all, when theyr were ſo manye ſuperiour officers to dyrect hym: and yet in thoſe dayes they vſed circumſpection in nothing more, then in chooſing of theyr Captaines, but ſeruice ſtanding as it dooth at this inſtant ouer it was then, wee ought to haue thrée times more regarde then they had, and yet we vſe tenne times leſſe then they did. And I wonder howe ſo many inſufficient men dare oppoſe them ſelues to vndertake a matter of ſo great importaunce, whoſe inexperience, beſides (by cyrcumſtaunce) that it concerneth the loſſe of a countrie, ſo in it conſiſteth the hazard of many mens liues, if it were

more but his owne, the matter were the leſſe, for hee may value of that as him ſelfe ſhall ſée good, but remorſe of conſcience ſhould touch him to conſider of his Countrimen, when his want of knowledge, ſhall ſometime bréede to much raſhnes, and ſometime againe to little courage. A Captaine that might be thought worthy, ſhould aſwell haue knowledge how to gouerne, as experience how to traine, wherein he is to vſe great diligence, inſtructing them in theyr order of aray, the vſe of theyr weapons, teachinge them to know the ſoundes of Drummes.
                     He muſt in no wiſe be iniurious to the Souldiour for his paye, but as carefully he muſt vſe diligence to get it, ſo as chéerefully he muſt paye euery may his due, hée that neglecteth this, neglecteth his owne credite and reputation, nay more his honeſty, neither is it fitte hée ſhould goe vnpuniſhed, yt barreth or deminiſheth a ſoul diour of hys paye. A Captaine ſhould bée loouing and comfortable to his companie, and as he is to correcte and puniſhe them for their faultes, ſo he is to commend and incourage them in theyr well dooinges: ſome conſideration a Captaine ſhould haue, for the carriage of conuenient neceſſaries for his ſouldiours, when they goe to the fielde, yet no more then muſt néedes he had, he ſhold haue ſome ſtore of Hatchets to cut bowghes to make their Cabbines, for want of which they breake many Swordes, to conclude, a Captaine that can carefully conſider of his Souldiours neceſſities, and leuinglie prouide to furniſhe theyr wantes, ſhall haue bothe vnfayned looue, and dutifull obedience of hys Souldiours, without the which, he is not onely aſſured to looſe his credite, but many times in more perrill of his owne company then of the enemy.

In diſcharging his duetie, his office is painefull, and therafter to be conſidered if his Captaine be gratefull.

He ſhould be a father amonge Souldiours, makinge the Captaine or Leifetenaunt priuie to theyr wantes, and to ſée all thinges equally diſtributed amongeſt them that there be no cauſe of diſcention: he ought in gentle and fréendly manner to appeaſe all ſtrifes and contentious quarrelles that ſhall fall out amongeſt Souldiours, and if by curteſie he can not perſwad thē, let him then bring the offenders to puniſhment. He muſt be ready to trayne and practiſe ſuch as he ſhal finde to be vnperfit in their weapons, gentely to ſhewe them the beſt and readyeſt way: Hee muſt ſée them to marche ſtraight in theyr ranckes carrying their weapons orderly without any communication, or loude ſpeaking amongſt them. A good Sarieant in a bad company, ſhall finde buſines more then inough tell they bée well trayned, and is therefore to be conſidered of by his Captayne.

                     IN the choyſe of a Souldiour, his manners and conditiones is firſt to bee reſpected, otherwiſe you may make choyſe of an inſtrument of many miſchéefes, the compoſition and abilitie of his body is then to be conſidered, in the like manner his ſufficencie for yeeres.
                     In England when ſeruice happeneth we diſburthen the priſons of Théeues, wee robbe the Tauernes and Alehouſes of Toſpottes, and Ruffines, wee ſcoure

both Towne & Cuntrie of Rogges and vagabons. And is not a Captaine that is furniſht with ſuch a company like to doo great ſeruice, and to kéepe them in good diſcipline. In other Countries where they vſe the ſeruice of malefactours, they admit them not for ſouldiours, but they ſend them to theyr Gallies and to other places of like ſlauery: And thoſe Captaines that hath made triall of ſuch Souldiours, would gladly be ridde of his charge to be eaſed of his trouble.
                     The firſt thinge therefore that is to be reſpected in a Souldiour is the honeſty of his minde, which beeing lincked with religion, there is no doubt but that Souldiour will be brought both to the feare of God, to the obedience of his Captaine, and to the obſeruaunce of diſcipline. The Romaines who for theyr martiall obſeruation were moſt renowned, the rather to kéepe Souldiours vnder awe and diſcipline, they adioyned to theyr owne lawes and ordinaunces the authority of God, and vſed with great; ceremonie to make them ſweare to keepe the diſciplines of warre. The Grecians in like manner, their ſouldiours being armed and brought to the Church receiued this oathe.
                     
                        I will not doo any thinge vnworthy the ſacred and holy wars, neither wil I abandō or forſake my band & Captaine to whom I am appointed, I will fight for the right of the Church and ſafety of the State: I will not make my Countrey to be in worſe caſe then it is, but I will make it better then I founde it: & I will euer frame my ſelfe reuerently to obey thoſe lawes alſo that the State ſhall hereafter by common aſſent inacte or ſette downe, that if any one ſhall chaunge the lawes or not obay them, I will not ſuffer him to my power, much leſſe will I allowe in ſo dooing, but I will be a ſure defender of right aſwell by my ſelfe alone, as when I am

with others, and I wil euer more honor the religion of my Countrey. To theſe my ſayings I call the Gods to witneſſe. Theſe and ſuch other like cathes the antiquitie adminiſtred to their Souldiours to nouriſhe obedience, for beſides valiaunce, a ſouldiour muſt be adorned with theſe ſpecial vertues, which are ſilence, obedience and truth: a good ſouldiour muſt haue ſpeciall regard to the kéeping of his furniture cleane & ſeruiceable, in ſtéede of dicing, drincking & ſwearing, let him vſe running wraſteling, leaping, or ſuch other like exerciſes of agility, let him kéepe his owne quarter and not depart without the licence of his officer, a Souldiour thus diſpoſed may cōfort him ſelfe with hope of aduauncemēt.
                  
               
               
                  ¶ Of Diſciplines.
                  AS theſe conſiderations in the chooſing of Captaines officers and ſouldiours, haue euer béene eſpeciallie regarded amongſt the moſt renowned, and beſt experienced warriours, ſo an army béeing thus choſen, ye lyke reſpect muſt be had in the appointing of lawes, diſciplines and orders, the which ye Generall by aduiſe of his counſaile is diſcréetly to ſet downe, and to haue them openly publiſhed by ſound of Trumpet, that the whole Campe may take notyce therof: and béeing thus proclaimed, he muſt vſe as great ſeuerity to haue thē maintained, for what wil it auaile the making of good lawes where there is no care had to ſée them ſurely kept.
                  We doo finde in the holy ſcriptures, and that in many places, aſwell in the booke of Moſes as the booke of Ioſua, where lawes and diſciplines of warre, were many times appointed by ye almighty God him ſelfe, and that he would not ſuffer diſobedience to eſcape vnpuniſhed, it is euident by Corah, Dathan and Abiram that were ſwallowed vp in the earth, for mutinie. But the Romanes who aboue the reſt did moſt excéede for their

martiall preſcriptiones, ſo they were as ſeuere in puniſhing the offences, of ſuche as ſhoulde infringe and breake theyr lawes of armes: They puniſhed with death him that lacked in the watch, he that forſooke the place that was giuen him to fight in, he that caryed any thinge hidde out of the Campe, if any man ſhould ſay he had doone ſome worthy thinge in fight and had not doone it, he that for feare had caſt away his weapon, and when it happened that the whole Legion had committed the like faulte, their names were taken and put together in a bagge, and euery tenth man as they were drawne were executed.
                  When Marcus Cato (after a token giuen) had looſed from the coaſt of his enemies, where he had laine a certaine ſpace and ſawe one of his Souldiours lefte on the ſhore, crying, calling and beckoning to be taken in, hée caſt about with his whole Nauie to the ſhore againe, and commaunded the ſame Souldiour to bee taken and ſtraight put to death: willinge rather to make him an example to the reſt, then that he ſhould be ſlaine by his enemies with reproch and infamie. The Romanes puniſhed nothing with more ſeueritie, then thoſe actions that were either attempted againſt commaundement or enterpriſed againſt reaſon, but as they puniſhed thoſe victories that were attained by lewde hardines, ſo miſfortune deminiſhed not his reputation, that attempted with diſcretion, neyther attributing cowardlines to ill ſucceſſe, nor valiaunce to good fortune, for the euent of ſuch enterpriſes commendes not the execution, neither is it the ſucceſſe that makes vs perfect wiſe, but to attempt with reaſon and iudgement, confirmes wee ſéeme to haue wiſdome.
                  
                     Papirius Curſor being Dictatour required, that Fabius Rutilius, ſhould firſt be beaten with roddes, and then

bée beheaded, becauſe he fought without his commaūdement (notwithſtanding he had the conqueſt,) neither would he forgiue the puniſhment, for the contention or enterceſſion and requeſt of the Souldiours, neither (per ſuing him to Rome whether he fledde) would he there remit this dreafull ſentence, till Fabius him ſelfe with his father fel both on their knées, and yt alſo the whole Senate and people made interceſſion for him. This were a harde world for ſome hare brainde Captaines, that are ready to choppe vpon euery chaunce, like a gudgion that is readie to bite at euery baite, neuer fearinge the hooke till ſhe be hanged by the lippes.
                  
                     Manlius Torquatus cauſed his ſonnes head to be ſtricken of becauſe he had forſaken his place, and went to fight with an enemie that had challenged him and ſtue him. And Saluſt dooth report, that there were more ſouldiours put to death amongſt ye 
                     Romanes, for ſetting vpō theyr enemies before they had licence, then for running out of the fielde before they had fought. And as the Romanes were thus preciſe in maintaininge theyr diſcyplines ſeuerely, ſo their Campe in thoſe daies was a Schoole of honour, Iuſtice, Obedience, duety and loyaltie: where nowe a denne of deceipte, trechery, theiuery, iniurie, and all manner of impiety.
                  ¶ Heereafter followeth ſundry Stratagemes, and many good inſtructions practiſed by the antiquity, and neceſſary for diuers purpoſes.
               
               
                  
                  
                     ❧ What is to be reſpected before you enter Battel.
                  
                  THe moſt renowned Emperour Auguſtus, gaue theſe inſtructions for Captaines as followeth, that although a Prince were mighty, yet if he were wiſe, hee would neuer giue battel, vnleſſe there were more apparant profit in the victory, then loſſe if the enemie ſhould ouercome. And the moſt approoued Captaines helde this opinion, that it were not good to bringe theyr men to fight, except they had aduauntage or elſe brought to it by conſtraint. The aduaū
                     tage groweth by the Scituation of the place, by order, or hauing of more or better men: The neceſſity happeneth, when they ſhall perceiue by deferringe of Battel it muſt néedes fall out to theyr diſcomodity, as when famiſhment were ready to aſſaile them, or when the enemie looketh for ſome newe ſupplie, in theſe cauſes it were better to attempt Fortune where ſhe may fauour rather then by deferringe, to ſée thy certaine ruine: Vigeſius giueth counſaile neuer to bring an armie to fight except they hope to haue the victory, for what greater ſigne is there to looſe, then not to beleeue to bee able to winne: to adde incouragement therefore to Souldiours there hath béene ſeuerall practiſes vſed by diuers. L. Silla in the warres againſt Archelaus, Mithridates Liefetenaunt at Pirea, perceiuing his Souldiours had little ſtomacke to fight, ſo weried then with continuall labour, that they were glad to deſire to fight.
                  
                     Q Fabius, knowing the Romaines to be of ſo liberal & honeſt nature, that by ſpiteful and contumelous dealing they would be ſoone mooued, vexed and gréeued, and looking

for no honeſt nor equall dealinge of ye 
                     Perſians who were his enemies, ſent vnto Carthage Ambaſſadours to intreate of Peace, which was conſented vnto, but with ſuch proude and vnreaſonable conditions, that the whole armie of the Romanes, were thereby ſtirred and incouraged to fight.
                  When Ageſilaus, had pight his fielde not farre from Orchomeno, a Cittie that was in league with him, and perceiuing that manie of his armie had theyr treaſure and chéefe riches in the Campe, hee commaunded the townes men to receiue nothing into the towne belonging to his armie, to the intent, his Souldiours might fight the more fiercelie, knowing they ſhould fight for liues and goodes. Fabius Maximus, fearing that his ſouldiours would not continue the fight manfully, by reaſon they might quickly fly to their ſhippes, commaunded they ſhould be ſet on fire before he would begin the battaile. Some haue conſtrained their men to fight through neceſſity, takinge away from them al manner of hope of ſauing them ſelues vnleſſe they did ouercome.
                  And there is nothing to concitate the mindes of men more to incouragement then perſwaſion, for him that knoweth howe to ſpeake well, for it kindleth the minde and humaine paſſions of a man, it taketh away feare, it ingendreth obſtinacie to fight, it diſcouereth deceiptes, it ſheweth perrilles and the way to auoide them, it prayeth, it promiſeth rewardes, it reprehendeth, it threateneth, it incourageth the mindes eyther of hope, eyther elſe of diſpaire. Epaminondas being ready to enter battaile with the Lacedemonians, to the ende that the ſtrength of his Souldiours might be holpen by ſome ſer uent meane, pronounced to them in his exhortation, that the Lacedemonians had determined (if they gotte the victorie) to ſlaie all theyr men, to make theyr wiues

and children bonde for euer, and to beate down the Cittie of Thebes flat to the ground: theſe wordes did ſo mooue the Thebanes to ſuch heate and furie, that at the firſt incounter they ouercame the Lacedemonians. It is much beneficiall for Captaines aduiſedlie to conſider of the Captaine of his enemies, whether he be raſhe or politique, whether he be fearefull or hardie, whether he be more ſtronge in horſemen or in footemen, and there after to vſe his owne aduauntage.
                  
                     Hannibal, perceiuing that Fuluius the Romane Captaine was negligent, and attempted many thinges vnaduiſedly, takinge the aduauntage of a miſte that had ſome thinge obſcured the ayre, he made a ſmall troupe of his Souldiours to ſhewe them ſelues to thoſe that kept watche in the Romane tentes, Fuluius haſtelie ruſhing towards them with his Hoſte, Hanniball on the the other ſide inuaded his Campe, and breaking out in the backe of the Romanes ſlue their captaine with 8000 of theyr beſt men at armes.
                  
                     Iphicrates of Athens hauing knowledge that his enemies were accuſtomed to eate ſtill at one time of the day, hee therefore commaunded that his owne people ſhould take theyr repaſt ſome thing more timelier, then raunging foorth in battaile in that inſtant that his enemies ſhould haue fallen to their victualles, he ſo dalied with them as hée would neither giue them battaile neither ſuffer them to depart, when it drewe towardes night, with drawing him ſelfe as though he went to his lodging, and kéeping his men ſtill ready armed, his enemies being aſwell wearied with longe ſtandinge and with long faſting, made haſt to refreſh them ſelues, and to betake them to theyr victualles, Iphicrates bringinge foorth his armie againe on the ſuddaine, ſetting on his enemies eaſely ouer came them.
                  
                     
It is many times behoueful for Captaines to 
                        〈◊〉
                      from fight, when the enemie is brought into ſome deſperate paſſion through famine or other like naturall neceſſities, and this cauſed the Lacedemonians, (béeing certified by theyr ſpyes) that the Meſſenians were ſette on ſuch a rage that they came to the battaile, men, women and Children, which cauſed the Lacedemonians to to deferre the fight.
                  Like wiſe when Caeſar in the cyuill warre had incloſed the Hoſt of Affranius and Petricus, within a trench, that they were pyned with thyrſt, in ſo much that they became deſperate, deſtroying all that would withſtande them or proffered them fight, which being perceiued by Caeſar, kept in his men ſuppoſing it then no time to begin. The like reſpect is to be had that in fight they bring not the enemie into any extreame deſperation, ſo to incloſe them that diſpayre ſhould make them fighte, which cauſed Hanniball, (when he had incloſed the Germaines at Tarſimenus by which conſtraint they fought excéeding féercely) to open his armie and to make them away to get out, beating them downe as they fled with out any perrill to his owne people. The like was vſed by L, Marcius a Romane Knight, when he had incloſed the Carthaginenſes, and ſo did Ageſialus with the Thebanes.
                  
                  When Themiſtocles had vanquiſhed the power of Xerxes, he would in no wiſe agrée that the bridge ſhold be broken, ouer the which they ſhould returne, ſayinge it were better to driue them out of Europe them to fight in diſpaire: All thinges thus conſidered, and a willingnes, ſetteled through the armie to fight, let them force that the charge be not giuen in a furie, which yet was neuer ſeconded by vertue, for it bréedeth diſorder and breache of araie, that if victorie be not had at the

very firſt brunte, theyr confidence beginnes to quaile, and then followeth preſente diſcomfiture: Nowe other wiſe where reſolution with order is obſerued there is no difficultye that may ariſe, but will bee an occaſion to confirme and ſtrengthen theyr courage with hope of victorie, which is neuer wanting where order and reſolution are linked togeather.
                  
                     Hanniball neuer gaue fight but he was ſtill prepared with ſome Stratagem, wherewith to amaze his enemies, which many times did ſtand him in ſteede for the attaining of ſeuerall victories. The ſpreading of rumours (duringe the fight) affirming the Captaine of the enemies to haue béene ſlaine hath manie times holpen, as Iugurth, in the battaile againſt C. Marius by the ſame policie made the Romanes to giue backe, ſo did Mironides of Athens againſt the Thebanes, whereby hee gotte the victory.
                  When Valerius Leuius fought againſt Pirrhus, and had kilde a priuate Souldiour, holding vp his ſword all bloody, made bothe the hoſts beléeue that he had kylled king Pyrrhus, wherefore his enemies ſuppoſing them ſelues to be deſtitute by the death of theyr Captaine, all abaſhed theygaue ouer ye fight. When a barbarous alien (in battaile) had brought worde to Q. Sextorious, that Herculeius was ſlaine, he ſlewe him ſtraght with his dagger, leaſt he ſhould haue borne thoſe newes any further to haue diſcouraged ye armie. Captaines are in like caſe well to conſider howe they followe theyr enemies till the battaile be perfourmed, for he that with his people diſordered perſueth the enemie, may ſometime giue the conqueſt from him ſelfe, as Q. Fabius Maximus conſull, béeing ſent to ſuccour the Sutrines againſt the Hetruſcines, the whole force of his enemies aſſayling him, hée diſſembling as though hee feared them made ſhowe

of flight til he had gotten the aduauntage of ground, the other following out of order, were by him not onely ſurpriſed but alſo bereaued of cheir Campe.

Martius perceiuinge the two hoſtes of the Perſians not lyinge farre from hym, careleſſe and out of order through affiaunce of theyr victory which before they had attained, perſwaded with hys Souldieurs to ſet vpon the hoſt that laye next vnto him in the midde of the night, where they made ſuche a ſlaughter that there was not ſo much as a meſſenger left aliue, to beare tidinges of this miſerable miſchaunce: then giuing hys ſouldiours ſome ſmall reſpyt to refreſhe them, the ſame night with all ſpéede preuenting the ſame of any thing doone, inuaded the other armie, and thus twyce in one night inioyed like happy chaunce of Battel, and ſtill following oportunitie, be euery where deſtroyed the Perſians, and reſtored Spaine againe to the Romanes.
                  
                  
                     
The victor after fight is ſo to deuide the ſpoyle as there may fall out no contention, he muſt not forget to burie his dead that ſhall be ſlaine in the conflicte, hee muſt raunſome home ſuche of hys Souldiours as the enemie holdeth pryſoners, to deale fauourably with hys enemies that are taken pryſoners by hym ſelfe, not onelie wynneth theyr hartes but maketh hym the more renowned. Theſe thinges thus perfourmed, he is eyther to followe the aduauntage of hys ſeruice, or elſe to retyre to ſome: place of ſecuritye where they may reſt: The perſued haue vſed to ſcatter money in the way, to hynder the followers. By this meane Triphon King of Siria eſcaped Antiochus Horſe men, and when the Gaulles ſhould fight with Attalus, they deliuered all theyr Golde and Siluer to bee kept of certayne men that might ſcatter it abroade if it happened they were put to flyght, to the intent they might the more eaſely eſcape, theyr enemies béeing hyndred with the gathering vp of the pray, but Galltroppes were to a more purpoſe to hynder Horſe men, and were better chepe to bée ſcattered about, then eyther Golde or Siluer. When Q. Sertorius was put to flight of Quintus Metellus Pius, hée ſuppoſed it not a thinge ſure inough to flye, but alſo he warned hys Souldiours to diſparple them ſelues diuers wayes, aſſigning them a place whether he would haue them to reſorte.
                  Some to preuent the worſte, would beginne the fight a little before night, to the ende that if they were ouerthrowne, through the darkenes of the night they might the better ſcape away. What might farther be ſayd, I leaue to the diſcretion of the ſkylfull Captaine, and will bréefely ſpeake of other neceſſaries not amiſſe to be remembred for ſome other purpoſes.

Alexander vſed to haue ſuch places diſcribed in mappes, which ſhould be hanged in the Campe, to be viewed by all, whereby they might learne to knowe the places, the diſtaunces, the wayes, the hilles, the Riuers, the fennes, the ſtraightes, the wooddes, and all places of perill: fitte for the enemie eyther to take aduauntages, or to hyde ambuſhes.

And as troupes may fal into theſe daūgers by marching thus vnawares ſo they muſt wiſely fore ſée that they be not trained into them by crafte, as the Fideniens, who lying for Romulus as hee ſhould paſſe, which hee by eſpiall gettinge intellgence of, laying part of his armie in ſecréet ambuſhe, then approching where his enemies were, from whom he fayned fearefully to flie, and they haſtely perſuinge him, hee brought them where his ambuſhes were layd, who aſſailing them on euery ſide eaſely ſlewe them: Some of purpoſe hath put foorth a pray and by ſuffering the enemie to take it, hath belayed theyr paſſage

them very liberallie, to rewarde the iniurie they had ſuſtayned by theyr long forbearinge of theyr paye, which for the time did ſome what appeaſe them, then preſently ſending his moſt truſty Stewarde to Otacilius Conſull, this Steward fayning to flye away about a controuerſie happening betwéene his Captaine and him in a certaine accompt that was betwéene them, hée tolde him further that the next night 4000, Gaulles ſhould be ſent out to get pray and pillage, if it pleaſed him to take any aduauntage, Otacilius neyther haſtelie creditinge this runawaies tale, neyther thinkinge it a matter to bée diſpyſed, layed an ambuſhe for them of his beſt approoued Souldiours, and incoūtering the Gaulies which Hanno of purpoſe had ſent foorth, put them all to ye Sword, and in the fight were ſome of themſelues ſlaine in lyke manner, which ſatiſfied the expectation of Hanno accordinglie.

But of al other, that victory is to be accounted moſt worthy that is obtained by honourable compoſition, rather then by ſpillinge of blood. Mining (if the Scituation wyll permit it) is next to be preferred both for expedition and lightnes of charge. The Captaine that mindeth to ſurpriſe eyther Towne, Forte, or Caſtle by famine, is ſometime inforced to it, when the Scituation is ſo ſtronge as it admitteth no other forceable meane: other whyles, they vſe it of policy for the ſafety of their owne

people, but it is neceſſary in theyr ſetting downe to intrench them ſelues ſo ſurelie euery way, that neyther behinde they might bee indaungered by any force that ſhould purpoſedly come to annoy them vnawares, neither from the towne they might receiue preiudice by iſſuing out vpon any ſodaine Canuazado: Where battery is to be preſented, the flankers are firſt to be diſplaced, the breach being after made, the aſſaulte muſt then ſpéedelie be giuen, that they neither haue reſpite to fortefie the breach, nor leaſure to ſtrengthen themſelues within.

full, yet ſtyll in this ſorte to deceiue them, is a meane rather to make them ſecure then heedefull, when they ſhall finde them ſelues to be ſo often mockt: The Allarmes that are giuen by enemies, are moſt vſually for the accompliſhment of ſome exployte, ſometimes to trayne to ambuſhe, ſometimes to caſt ſome bridge, ſometimes to plant ordenaunce, ſometimes to make diſcouery, eyther of order, number or ſtrength: but when any Allarme ſhall be giuen in the night it is very expedient to chaunge the worde.

                        THe antiquitie longe ſithens before either Muſkette, Caliuer or Hargubuſe was knowen, armed theyr people with Croſbowes, Targettes, Longe ſwordes, Glaues, Partiſines, Halberdes and ſuch other like ſhorte weapons, in the ordering whereof, he euer had the aduauntage that in the fourme of his imbattelinge, could bring moſt men to fight, whereupon they framed many proportions which were both requiſite and beneficial as the ſeruice then required, but as time hath nowe altered the manner of fight, would ſerue to no purpoſe at all.
                  For example, the one if hee had ſéene the enemie imbattailed in a Triangle, he would preſently haue ordered himſelfe into a ſheare battaile, incounteringe one of the corners of his aduerſarie according to this figure.

The Croſſe battaile (the figure wherof is this inſuing) is a moſt excellent fight, but to order it in due proportion to euery number is a little difficult and aſketh longer time then I can now ſtand about, and will there fore leaue it tyll ſome other oportunitie.

But the fight now onelie conſiſting in Shot and Pikes, there is no fourme of imbatteling to be preferred before the iuſt ſquare, or if your numbers be ſufficient to order them into 2. 3. or 4. ſquadrons according to theſe figures.

                  THeſe fourmes for pickes, when they are winged and trouped with ſhot accordinglie, as (in the plaine fielde) there is no other order that dooth excéede them for ſtrength, ſo they are better for other purpoſes as hereafter ſhall appeare, but this is to be reſpected that where ther is not at the leaſt 2000, pikes in place, they ſhold not be deuided into more ſqua drons thē one, vnleſſe it be to kepe ſome ſtraight or gap or vpō ſome other aduauntage of ground, neither were it good to deuide the pikes into more then thrée Squadrons, where there is not fiue or ſixe thouſand in the fielde, nor into foure, ſquadrons, where there is not tenne or twelue thouſand: for this hath euer béene obſerued for a principle amongeſt ſouldiours of the beſt experience, the ſtronger your pikes are together in

number, the battaile is accounted to be the more forceable, but the ſhot to be deuided into manie troupes, are the better to maintaine fight, and the apter for ſeruice.
                  I haue hetherto made no mention of our olde Engliſh weapons, namely the Bowe, the browne Byll, or Halberd, ſometimes had in great reputation, amongſt vs, the bow is alreadie ſet aſide, yet there bee ſome that thinkes it to be a weapon of wonderful ſeruice, and to maintaine their opinions, wil aleadge ſundry reaſons, manie of them ſcarce woorth the ſpeaking of, but this might ſuffice, that men of iudgment and dailie experience, findes them to be to ſo little purpoſe, that we ſée they neuer call for them, yet this I wyll ſay, (and it cannot be denyed) that where bowes may be brought to ſerue againſt horſe, they might be very well, and ſtand in ſome ſtead, but ſo many ready ſhotte that were placed in their roomes, woulde doo a great deale better, and more daungerous to the enemie. In like manner our browne Bill, Halberd, or other ſhorte weapon, are moſt naturall for our Engliſhmen for where they may be brought to dealing of dry blowes, I think there is no other Nation that were able to ſtand againſt them, but the childe that is but this day borne from his mothers wombe, ſhall neuer liue to ſée two battailes incounter pell mell, the one with the other, as héere before they haue doone, and to what ende then ſhould ſo many ſhort weapons ſerue, that are euer placed in that part of the battaile which ſhould bee moſte ſtrong, where they can neuer be brought to doo ſeruice. But ſuch as will néedes haue ſuch ſtore of ſhort weapons, were better to place them in ſome winge, readie to be drawne foorth vpon anie execution, for which purpoſe they might be very requiſite: and yet if anie inuaſion ſhould be made in our own Country, I wold

neyther miſlike of bodies nor bylles for a readines, our people béeing ſo much inclined, and beſt practiſed in thē and might be ſo ordered wt the helpe of other weapons, as might doo ſeruice for ye preſent: but ye very ſtrength and bulwarke in the field, is the ſtand of pykes, which béeing impald and trouped with ſhot orderly, are defenſible both againſt horſe and foote, but ſo many ſhorte weapons placed in the middle of the battel, dooth wonderfullie weaken it, and make it more eaſſe and paceable for ye Launce: I haue ſometimes ſéene ſquadrons ſo placed, as their ſhort weapons haue made deuiſion of their pykes, running quite through the body of theyr battaile from flanck to flanck, and the pykes but onelie guarding the fore and rereward, the which kinde of imbattelling is neither ſtrong nor formall, but if you will néedes haue ſhort weapons placed in your ſquadrous, let them be impald euery way a like as well with pikes as with ſhot. And that the iuſt ſquare is eſpecially to be preferred, may eaſely appeare by theſe conſiderations.
                  Firſt it is not very curious in placyng, ſecond it is eaſie for Souldiers to march, eſpecially if they haue to paſſe any ſtraights through the which they may bee drawne by 5. or 3. in a ranck (if the place will affoorde no greater ſcope) and be ſuddainly brought againe into their firſt proportions without any manner of confuſion: but eſpecially the iuſt ſquare is moſt defencible and ſtrong, both againſt horſemen and footemen, wher there is no aduauntage to be taken of ground, either of hedge or dytch, ryuer, hyll, or other like.
                  To this end I haue ſet downe a Kalender wyth the true roote of euery number, from 100. to 10000. by the helpe whereof, knowing how many armed men be in place, they may ſuddainly be brought into a iuſt ſquare

2. 3. or 4. as the numbers wyll ſuffice to make them ſtrong, the which béeing once placed, as an eaſie workman (the foundation béeing firſt layd, findes it no great dificulty to goe forwarde with the reſidue of the building, ſo the armed men béeing thus placed in iuſt proportion, then after to impale with ſhot to proportionatly, according to the number of the pykes, and to deuide the ouerplus of the ſhot into ſeueral troupes ready to be drawne foorth vpon any occaſion, the matter is ſo eaſie to be performed, as a Souldiour that is but of one monethes trayning, will neuer erre nor ſtumble in the executing.
