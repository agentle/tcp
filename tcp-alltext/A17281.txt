               SIndrie and vechtie reasonis
(My Sonerane) mouis me
not onlie to haue Zour M. in

in offering my humil seruice bayth be

benefeit quhilk I receauit of zour hienes

sik malitious personis, as cruellie socht the
schedding of my innocent blude: For being
impresoned first in the Castel of Sanctandrois,
and nixt in the tolbuith of Edinburgh,
nocht for onie euil doing, bot for oppin professione
of the treu and Catholik Religion,
quhilk nocht onlie al kingis and Quenis

quhairof lykuyse God of his infinit gudnes

deliuering me out of the thraldome and

the quhilk (alace) manie be ane blind zeal ar

in presone, to the oppin confusion of the Ministeris
coniurit ennimeis to the immaculat
spous of our head, and saluiour Christ Iesus:
Thay conspyrit maist cruellie aganis my lyf

of lese maiestie: Bot quhen the Essyis var tuyse

of hir ennimeis, scheu the richteousnes

fauore of aequitabil iustice receauit my
letter of humil supplication, hauing verie gude

God to perserue zour M. Frō the schedding

of al kingis sua infixit in zour merciful hairt,
that incontinent zour grace commandit
straitlie, that na iniustice sould be exerceised
aganis zour M. auin schollar: This vas the
kinglie voce, and clemēcie proceiding of Iustice
and godlines, quhilk preseruit my lyf
from the bludie handis of tha cruel tygres:
zit thir persecutaris of Christis mēbris being
maist offendit, that by thair expectatione, I
had obtenit sik fauore of zour hienes, and
being brint vith ane insatiabil thrist of my

by zour M. vil and intelligence, to haue hungred
me to death, be debarring al access of

And quhen extreme danger of famine
constrainit me to hing ouer ane purse at the

saik, thay persauing the reuth and compassiō
of Godlie and cheritable people, quha bestouit
thair almous on me maist liberalie, causit

that quhilk vas conforme to aequitie, zit God
sua mouit his hairt, that he praesentit ane requeist
of myne to the Prouoste ād honorable
Concile of Edinburgh for licence to beg almous,
quhairbie I micht be sustenit: The quhilk
albeit it vas grantit be the discretion of
the Prouoste and Honorable Concile, zit the

Ministeris obtenit ane discharge forbidding
that I sould ask support in the name of ane
schollar, or affix onie letter vpon the purse
for signification of my indigence: bot nochtuithstanding
al thair raige conceaued aganis

of thair seditious haeresie, and the imbraceing
of the treu Catholik religion agane,
quhom I pray the Lord to recompāse, quhen
he sal distribut to al men according to thair
doingis in this varld. Nou becaus thir capital
ennimeis, and cruel persecutaris of Christian
and Catholik men, var frustrat of my death,
feiring that I vald haue disclosed thair erroneous
doctrine gif I had remanit in the cuntrey,
nocht onlie procurit my vnnatural banishment,
causing me find souertie vndir the
pane of fyue hundreth pūdis, nocht to returne,
bot also in my absence thay haue declairit
thair malice and inquensibil hetret aganis my
schaddou, laboring to bring me in contempt
be thair fals and sklanderous accusationis, as
thay do al vtheris, quha may schau hou thay
haue collectit ane cōfusit mass of the haereseis
quhilk hes bene condemnit be the Catholik
kirk sen Christ and his Apostles dayis: And
to bring me in farder contempt thay haue
spred the brute throuch the popularis, that in
sik conference as I had vith thame in presone

thay var altogidder victorious, and be this
and siclyk fraudful menis, detracting vtheris,
thay labore to mentene thame selfis, and
thair erroneous doctrine amang the rude
people: Bot to the effect that zour M. and al
zour G. treu subiectis, may knau hou friuole
and impertinent thair reasonis var, I haue
breiflie collectit my hail discours and disputation
vith the Ministeris, and vther Protestaons
in Scotland, and tane the hardines to dedicat
the same vnto zour M. as ane Scholaris
taikin and signification of the perpetual remembrance
of the benefeit quhilk I haue receauit
of Zour Royal humanitie, Beseiking
zour M. and al zour louing subiectis to reid
the same vith sik attentiue consideration that
the reasonis of the ane, and the vther being
considerit vithout al inordinat affection, zour
G. may planelie persaue thair haeretical, and
maist pernicious doctrine to be the cause of
the loss ād tynsal of manie thousand saulis in
zour M. realme. In consideratione quhairof
zour M. sould be mair occupeit than in inlargeing
zour temporal kingdome and dominione,
as that is the onlie moyen quhairbie
zour g. may attene to aeternal faelicie: And I
hoip that God hes praeseruit zour hienes out
of sa monie dangeris, euin sen zour infancie
to mak zour M. ane instrument (as he maid
Iosias) to repair the ruine and destructione of
the kirk of Scotland, be iust correctione of

thay var intrudit be violence, sua laboris
be the sam meane vithout repentance to arrogat
vnto thame felfis the Authoritie of spiritual
Pastores, maist viuelie representing to

            TO THE CHRISTIANE
REIDAR.
            
               I Thocht gude to aduerteis the Christian
reidar, that in the beginning of
my conference, being onlie examinat
be Maister Andro Meluine, gif I
had bene groundit in the Catholik religion
or nocht, I ansuerit according to his interrogationis,
and sua I haue put the mater in vritt
rather in maner of ane Catechisme, nor disputatione,
euin as it proceidit in verie deid: In
the progress of my conference I haue brocht
al the argumentis of the Ministeris vithout
onie dissimulatione, detracting nathing from
the force and strenth of the same: As to my
auin Ansueris, albeit I haue retenit the substā
               ce
of thame, zit find and greitar commoditie
of buikes heir nor in Scotland, I haue sumpairt
amplifeit ād inlargeit thame, to accommodat
my self to the capacitie of the ruid
people, quha could not be abil to comprehend
sua vechtie materis in sua feu vordis, as I
vas constrainit to vse in my conference: As to
the Names of the Ministeris and vtheris quha
disputed aganis me, I haue expressit the names
of thame quhom I kneu, and quhen I kneu

thame not, I haue vryttin in general Minister,
or Protestaon: Concerning my auin persone,
I vas brochtup from my tender eage in the
doctrine of Caluine, quhilk of lait dayis hes
bene receauit in the realme of Scotland be
the preaching of Schir Ioann kmnox, and did
follou it vith na les affectione and zeal nor
did the rest, quhil the tyme it pleased God
throuch reiding of sum Catholik vryttaris
to illuminat my hairt, and lat me planelie vnderstand
that sik doctrine vas nocht that, quhilk
vas preachit be Christ and his Apostlis,
and hes euer bene mentened, be al Christianis
sen thair dayis: bot onlie ane collectit Mass of
auld and condemnit haereseis, quhilk quhen
I vas thair present, I obleised me to defend,
and proue befoir the General Assemblie of
Scotland, declairing my self maist villing to
suffer puneishment, vnles be the grace of God
I performed that quhilk I had tane in hand,
Ask and of ane Minister callit Smeton, in Paislay,
that I micht haue frie access to thair general
Assemblie to be conuenit in Edinburgh
schortlie thaireftir: To the quhilk petition
(as he him self can not deny) he could ansuere
na thing bot that it vas maist iust, and p
                  •
               omeist
to me vpon his fayth and treuth, that I
sould haue frie access thairto: In the mentyme
ve condescendit to stand at the iudgement of
thrie maist learned of the Nobilitie, and thrie
of the Ministeris chosin be him, vith thrie
Bischopis, and thrie men of lau chosin be me:

The headdis of doctrine quhairupone ve
sould haue reasoned var thir, 1. of the Calling
of the Ministeris of Scotland. 2. Of the Sacramentis,
and verteu thairof. 3. Of the inaequalitie
of Pastores, and iudge lauchful in debait
of Religion. 4. Of the definitione and causis
of Iustificatione. 5. Of the definitione of
Grace quhilk ve receaue be the merite of
Christ. 6. Quhidder gif ane man being in
grace in verie deid be inuart renouatione of
his hairt, may loss the same agane or nocht?
The maist honorables the Maister of Ross,
The lairdis of Calduole, Blakhal, and Ihonestone
quha var praesent, can beir recorde, that
hauing confidence in Goddis halie spirit, I
tuik in hand, that vnles, be the the iudgement
of tha tuelf, (being suorne to iudge according
to the reasonis of bayth the pairteis vithout
feir, fead, or fauore) I prouit the Ministeris haeretikis
and deceaueris of the people, I sould
nocht refuse quhat puneishment thay pleased
to deuyse aganis me, requiring na thing of the
Ministeris, bot recantation: And for securitie
that for my pairt I sould abyd at this apoyntmēt,
I subscriuit thir headdis vith my hand at
Paislay, in presence of the Noble men befoir
mentionat: Bot my aduersare Smeton be his
traittorous dealing aggreād to his profession,
eftir that I had depairted fra him in peax vnto
the tyme apoyntit, vithout onie varning
proceidit vith excommunication aganis me,
albeit I vas not subiect to his iurisdictione,

and thaireftir send to Edinburgh and procurit
letteris of captione, quhairbie I vas socht
throuch the hail cuntrey, and at the last being
apprehendit, vas vayrdit in the tolbuith of
Edinburgh fra the fourtene of October in
the zeir of God ane thousand fyue hundreth
and fourscoir, to the penult of Ianuar. Quhair
I had sik confort and consolation, be reason
I sufferit for confession of the name of Christ,
that I had neuer gretar in my lyf, and thocht
my self happie gif I had obtened that grace
to haue deed in the actione: Sua the Ministeris
in place to haue granted me audience at
thair general assemblie, detenit me in strate
presone: Aluyse God turnit al to the best,
and gaif me grace to ganestand and refel quhatsumeuer
thay could obiect vnto me, as the
Christian reidar may esilie persaue of this our
conference, quhilk I beseik euerie man to
reid vithout al affectione of pairteis, and vith
ane erneast desyre to knau the treuth concerning
euerie controuersie: Considering that
na Minister in Scotland vil ansuer for him in
the day of Goddis dreidful iudgement, bot
that euerie man vil ansuer for him self,
and haue na excuse gif he haue adhaerit
to onie fals Prophetis, the quhilkis the scripture
commandis euerie man to auoyd vndir
the pane of aeternal damnatione: And mekilles
vil the follouaris of this neu doctrine in
Scotland haue onie excuse, be reasone Maister
Iohne Hamiltone ane learned man and

verie zelous defendar of the Catholik fayth,
in name of al the Catholik Scottis mē (be thair
auyse and requeist) in France and vther cū
               treyis,
offered that thay sould cum to Scotland
on thair auin expensis, and disput vith the
praetendit Ministeris, offering thair bodeis
to the fyre, vnles thay conuictit thame to be
Haeretikis, quhilk offer (as I vndirstude of thair
priuat cōmunicationis) the Ministeris dar
not accept: Lyk as thay durst neuer mak onie
ansuere to the quaestionis proponit be Maister
Iohne Hay Concerning thair doctrine, Ecclesiastical
ordore, and discipline: feiring that
thairbie thair erroris sould haue bene dissit
to the people. Bot not to trouble zou, gude
reidar, vith farder declaratione of the vilful
malice, ād affectat ignorāce of the Ministeris,
albeit I haue gude hoip of sum of the zoūg mē
quha var nocht the beginnaris of this mischeif
in Scotland, bot be simplicitie and ouer
facil credulitie var deceauit be sum mischant
Apostatis: And praying maist humelie the
eternal God, that he assist zou vith his halie
spirit to the treu vndirstanding of the veritie
I vil nou vith goddis grace enter vnto our
cōference.

               It is ane supernatural gift, creatit be God
of his auin gudnes, frelie vithout ony deseruing
of man, quhairby the saul of man is perfytlie

subiect vnto God, and the body vnto
the Saul, quhairby also he is abil to do thai

               Vas Adam abil to haue fulfillit the commandiment,
quhilk he reccauit in Paradise?

               M.
               It lay not in his possibilitie to keip the commā
                  dement.
For gif he had keipit the same, our Saluiour
CHRIST vald not haue cūmit in the flesch
to mak satisfaction for sin. And it vas necessar that
he sould cum in the flesch as he did, thairfore conclude
I, that the fal of Adam vas necessar, and that it
vas impossible, that he micht haue keipit the commandiment.
            
            
               B.

he sould cum in the flesch to mak satisfactione
for sin I. ansuer, that it vas not absolutlie necessar,
bot vnder condition onlie, to vit gif Adam

Becaus as affirmis S. Paul, the iustice of
Christ is cōmunicat vnto vs, euin as the syn of
Adam is cōmunicat. And ze subsume that the
iustice of Christ is not treulie cōmunicat vnto
vs, bot onlie be imputation, sua necessarlie it
follouis that the syn of Adam is onlie impute
to vs and that ve ar not treulie borne in syn,
quhilk vas the blasphemous us heresie of Pelag.

               B.
               Albeit the auctoritie before alleagit be sufficient,
zit I may esilie proue the same be
may.Rom. 5. For S. Pavl vryttand to the Rom. testifeis
that the cheritie of God is pourit in our hairtis
be the halie spreit quhilk is geuin vnto vs.
And to the Corinth:2. epst. c. 12. my grace is sufficient
vnto the. Quhairfore I vil maist glaidlie
glore of my auin vaiknes that the pouar and
strenth of Christ may abyd in me. In the
quhilk testemonie it is euident that the grace
of God quhilk is ane thing vith our iustice
signifeis ane inhaerent strenth, and pouar,
quhairby ve may obey the desyris of the spreit

and concur to the operations thairof. Quhair
fore ze blindit Protestantis ar grettumlie
deseauit, quha vil acknaulege na vther signification
of grace, bot that quhilk is definit
be the orateur Cicero, especiallie in sik formes
of speking: Rediit cum illo in gratiā:1. Colos. 6. Gal. for
the Apostle S. Paul callis it ane vork and

estait of mankynd?
            
            
               B.
               Euin as the zung childrene be the first
Adam, hes contractit original syn, sua be the
secund Adam, that is be Christ, thay ar purgit
fra it be the lauer of regeneration, as testifeis
S. Paul,Tit. 3. be the quhilk thay ressaue the grace
of God, quhairby thay ar iustifeit: And
quhen thay cum to the zeris of discretion,
producis varkis that meritis eternal lyf.
            
            
               M.
               Let vs then cum to that fourt estait of mankynd
quha as thou sayis fallis in deid lie syn efter restitution
to grace thruch Christ. Bot first let me vnderstand,
quhat thou callis deidlie syn, Becaus I knau
na sik distinction of sin in the halie scripture.
            
            
               B.
               The distinction of mortal synnis, from
venial quhilk ar spiritual diseisis of the Saul
may be vnderstand be comparation vith bodelie
infirmeteis: for as of thame sum ar sa far
ennemie to nature, that in ane moment thay
prouok suddane and haistie death: vthers
quhairby our natural temperature of body is

vitiat, may the mair eselie be curit: Siclyk
thair is ane kynd of syn that expellis grace
quhilk is the lyf of the Saul, and the vther
kynd albeit it fyllis the Saul, zit it may consist
vith grace: This includis not manifest contempt
of God, bot is onlie ane inordinat behauiour
in louing of the creature proceding
of negligence, ignorance, and infirmitie. This
distinction of synmis is declarit in the euangel
of S. Mat.S. Mat. 5. Bot I say vnto zou quhatsūeuir
he be quha is offendit vith his brother raschlie
is oblest to iugement: he quha sayis to his
brother Raha, is subiect to the cōcile: and he
quha callis his brother fule, is vorthie of the
fyre of hell. Be the quhilk is vordis Christ him
self declairis, that al synnis deseruis not eternal
dānation: and sua cōsequentlie that al syn
nis ar not mortal or deidlie: By that it is cleir
in the scripture, that quhair deidlie syn is, the
cheritie and loue of God can not be, be rason
he quha is in deidlie syn, is in the estait of dā
                  tion:
and quha is in cheritie, he is heriture of
the lyf euerlesting, and zit he quha is in cheritie
is not vithout al syn as testifeis S. Iohne.1. Ioan. 3.
quha sayis he is vithout syn he is ane lear.
Than of necessitie ve man gather that al
synnis ar not mortal or repugnant to cheritie,
bot sum venial that may consist vith cheritie
as according to the vord of God the kirk
hes euer beleuit.
            
            
               M.
               hou than is the fourt estait of manknd restorit
to the iustice quhilk thay ressauit be Baptisme?
            
            
               
               B.
               Insafar as thay lossit the grace ressauit be
the abuse of thair auin frie vil, restitution
man be maid be the Sacrament of penitence
quhair of Christ did speik to his Apostlis
quhen he said:1. Ioan. 20 Quhatsūeuir synnis ze remit,
thay salbe remittit.
            
            
               M.
               To mak ane end then of my question, reherse
schorlie the causis of Iustification?
            
            
               B.
               The efficient caus is God the glorious
trinitie quha creatis iustice in the hairt of
man. The meritorious caus: is Christis death
and passion. The formal caus: is grace inherent
in the mynd, as the health of the Saul
restorit. The fenal caus is glorification, to
the quhilk God hes predestinat his elect before
the beginning of the varld.

               Sen ane man efter the fal of Adam

quhilk appertenis to the natural libertie of
man. Quhairfore I acknaulege vith the halie
Doctors exponand the scripturis thrie kindis
of libertie, Ane natural, in al men regenerat
and vnregenerat, for as al men hes reason
and vil, sua in al actions quhilk ar properlie
callit thairs thay haue election and fredome,
quhairby thay may ather do the contrar gif
thay pleis, or leue that quhilk thay do, vndone.
Of this libertie spekis S. Paul: haue I not
pouar to carie about vith me ane sister as vthers
quhilk pouar as he schauis in that place
he vsit not, bot villinglie refusit to haue onie.
The secund is callit the libertie of grace, quhilk
euerie man efter the fal of Adam hes not,
bot onlie quha being purgit from thair synnis
be the blude of Iesus Christ, resauis that
gift of goddis beneuolence, quhairby vithout
ony compulsiō or necessitie thay ar frelie
mouit vith feir and dredure to vork thair
auin saluation, be assistance of this grace and
Christis halie spreit. Of this libertie our saluiour
spekis in the euangel of S. Iohne:S. Ioan. 8. 1. Cor. 
                        •
                     . Gif
the sone put zou to libertie ze ar frie in verie
deid. And S. Paul: Quhair the spreit of the lord
is, thair is fredome & libertie. albeit thay quha
ar in this libertie, may do gude varkis vithout
syn, zit be infirmitie of nature thay quha
standis in it, be thair auin default may fal
from the same. The thrid is the libertie of

glore, quhilk is in gude angellis and sanctis
nou glorifeit, quhilk hes adionit vith it assurance
of gude doing vithout al syn.
            
            
               Louson.
               I vil proue that mā efter the fal of Adam
hes na frie vil, Becaus the hail scripture testefeis that
men vnregenerat ar altogither bent vnto: syn nather
may thay de onie gude thing according to the saying
of our maister Christ: vithout me ze may do na thing.
               
            
            
               B.
               Gif zour allegeance var maid in forme of
argument, the reason alleagit sould in verie
deid be knauin maist sophistical, and impertinent.
Becaus I demand not quhidder gif a
man vnregenerat may do thaj varkis be the
pouar of his frie vill vithout special grace
qukilk leidis to lyf eternal, bot onlie gif the
vil in ane vnregenerat man be frie or not.
            
            
               L.
               Be reason the vil of man vnregenerat is abill to do
euil onlie, I can not vnderstand hou it may haue
fredome, sense frie vil hes pouar to do ather gude or
euil.
            
            
               B.
               Ze ar deceauīt be ane vitious definition
of frie vill to vit quhilk may ather do gude or
euil: for gif ze grant this definitiō sufficient ze
salbe cōpellit to deny that god or the gud an
gelles haue frie vil becaus nather god nor the
gude āgellis cā do euil. The vil thairfore is frie,
Becaus quhen al thingis requesit to the operation
thairof, ar present it may ceis from vorking
gif it pleis him quha sould performe the
vark. And thairfore I am assurit, that as sathan

is anthor of al euill, sua hes he craftelie sauin
in zour hairtis this erronious opinion to
clok zour vickednes quhairby ze refuse all
kynd of reprehension. For being rebukit
according to zour doctrine ze may ansuer I
micht not do vtheruyse: sua consequentlie ze
transfer the caus of zour transgression to God
making him the author of syn and affirming
that al thing cūmis of absolut necessitie.
               Farder the grund quhilk ze haue laid, to vit
that ane vnregenerat man may do euil onlie,
is not sure, becaus ze acknaulege not ane distinction
of gude varkis to vit in gude varkis,
quhilk by reason thay proceid from grace
thruch Christ Iesus thaj deserue lyf eternal.
And in gude varkis moral quhilk may be in
the vnregenerat, as quhen thay honor thair
parentis, quhen thay do thair deutie touart
thair nichtbour, or thair cōmonveil, quhen
thay giue almous vnto the pure, and in vther
siclyk actions he the quhilk varkis ze vil not
say that thay deserue eternal dānation, by that
becaus that be the help and special assistāce of
god thay may repēt of thair synnis, and turne
thame selfis vnto god thay haue frie vil, and
remanis in thair former lyf, not be necessitie
as ze maist falslie allege, bot maist frelie of
thair auin election, Becaus thay vil not follou
the motion and instinction of the halie spreit
be the quhilk thay ar valknit and callit to
Repentance. Thairfore zour argument is

vicious in al pointis in denying ane thing
quhilk is maist cleir and euident in the self
quhair in ze follou the futesteppis of Symon
Magus and the Manicheans,Clemens li. 3. recog. Aug. de fide contra

               M.
               thou maruellis that ve afferme that al thingis
cūmis of necessitie, sen thou can not escaip to grant
the same. Considering God hes the foresicht of al
thingis before thay cum, the quhilk foresicht being
infallibill, It is ne

as thay ar foresene be god.
            
            
               B.
               This zour argument is sufficient to deceaue
the pure ignorant people. bot quhen it is
examinat as it aucht to be, it is fund maist
vane and sophistical, zea repugnant to zour
seluis. Becaus ze confes that Adam quhen he
vas creatit be God had fre vill and zi
                     •
                   ze can
nocht deny bot god had the foresicht of al
thingis quhilk Adam vas to do, then the frie
vil of man and foresicht of god ar not repugnant
to thame selfis, zea gif zour argument
var gude god him self vald not haue frie vil,

god foreseis al thingis quhilk he is to do: sua
according to zour argument he dois all thingis
of necessitie, quhilk is ane blasphemie. Gif
ze had imployit zour tyme better in the schullis,
ze vald haue learnit that quhilk S. Auhalie

Doctors vryttis: that ane man is not to
be euil, becaus god hes forekuanin that, Bot
becaus he vas to be euil god forekneu the same
quha can mifknau na thing to cum. And
the proper caus quhairfore he vas to be euil
is his auin frie vil, Becaus he vald not obey the
vil and cōmandement of god. Thairfore
ane man sould not reiect the caus of his auin
euil and vickednes to the prescience of god,
bot to him self and his auin inobedience,
Bot ze in this follou the futsteppis of all the
vicked men quha euer hes bene in the varld,
quha to defend thame self castis the caus of
thair vickednes on god and vpon ane fatal

of the Sacramentis of the euangelicall lau grace
is geuin ex Opere operato, as thay speik, vnles the ressauer

               B.
               I think I aucht to giue alsmekle credeit to
the scholastik Doctors as to zou and zit that

the sacramentis geuis grace ex opere operato
is not onlie thair Doctrene as ze appeir to
say, bot the doctrein of Christ him self, quhilk
becaus peraduenture ze vnderstand not I vil
declair it: I afferme then vith the hail catholik
kirk, that the Sacramentis ar the caus of
grace not be verteu of the resauer, nor be
verteu of the geuar, bot be the verteu of
the blude of Christ quhilk vorkis be thame
in vs,Ephes. 5. to our sanctification, sua that quhen ze
deny that the sacramentis hes thair strenth
ex opere operato, ze deny the strenth and
efficacie of Christis institution and blude
and denyis his eternal preistheid, sence it pertenis
to it not onlie to haue payit our ranson,

to apply the said ranson vnto vs, quhilk

is groundit vpon this promeis of Christ: he
quha sal beleue,S. Mare. 16. and be baptesit, salbe saif.
the necesitie thairof vnto all mankind is denuncit
be the threatning of Iesus Christ: Except
ane man be borne of valter and the spreit,
he may not enter in the kingdome of God.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  Baptisme is not necessar,S. Ioan. 3. becaus Paul. vryttis

                  Gif ze vnderstand be thair sanctification

sayis that the vnfaithfull vomā is sanctefeit

               B.
               It is ane sacrament nixt follouing

Be the quhilk the grace that ve haue ressauit

The element of this sacrament is oyle and

this sacramēt consistis in the vordis, quhairby

               Ze appeir to misknau quhat is ane outuard

hou in the administration of this sacrament
the absolutiō of the preisthis is ane signe that

               M.
               Nou haue I curage to lauch sence thou art not

that ane preist may giue absolution of synnis.

               Sir it is na maruel, for zour maner and

               Quby affirmit thou before that satisfaction is

quhilk our maister Christ hes maid is sufficient for

               B.
               The satisfaction of our saluiour Christ is
sufficient indeid for the synnis of the hail
varld, Bot zit it is applyit to thame onlie quha
thruch the grace of his satisfaction ressauit,

                  s S.
Paull. ve suffer vith him that ve may be glorifeit

togither vith him that the temporal pane
quhilk vevillinglie sustein for our synnis committit,
is in this respect callit satisfaction to
the iugement of God. Becaus heirby the passion
of Christ is maid ouris be assistance of
his grace and halie spreit, quha performis this
satisfaction in vs. Of the quilk S. Paul vryttis
to the Corinth.2. Cor. 7. 
                  This that for the offēce of god
ze haue bene sorifull, hou gretcairfulneshes it
ingenerit in zou zea hou gret satisfactiō, hou
gret indignation, hou gret feir, hou gret desyre,
hou gret aemulatione, hou gret reuēgement?
And this I. reid to haue bene the mening of the
vniuersall kirk sen the beginning as Caluin
zour maister himself cā not dissimble:Caluin instit. lib. 3. cap. 4. And thairfore
sayis in plane vordis that the hail anciēt
fathers, hes bene deceauit in this point. Bot becaus
as apperis al zour felicitie consistis in delicat
cheir and treating of zour selfis, and zour
fair vyffis, this doctrine of satisfaction or Paenitence
can nocht enter in zour hairtis.
            
            
               M.
               Is it necessar that euerie man, quha hes committit
syn sustene temporal pane that heirby he may haue
participation of the satisfaction quhilk Christ hes
maid for sin?
            
            
               B.
               I. maruel of zou quha callis zour self à
maister in Israël, hou ze can doubt that efter
the remission of syn ve aucht to vnderly sum
temporal payne:2. Reg. 12. sen ze reid that Dauid the halie
prophet notuithstanding he had gottin remission
of his syn zit he vas verie hauelie puneist

had forgeuin him the giltenes of his syn, zit
he said vnto him: maledicta terra in opere tuo:
Cursit be the earth in thy vark. And ve vnto
this present thole diuerse trublis for the syn of
Adam. The lyk may be confirmit be innumerabill
testimoneis of the hail scripture. Sua I
ansuer vnto zou maist resolutlie vith the vniuersal
kirk that the satisfaction of Christ is
not applyit vnto vs, except that ve indure sik
temporal payne ather in this varld, or in the
varld to cum. And I let zour self consider, gif
it be according to reason, that Christ quha vas
our heid vas crounit vith the croun of thorne,
and drank the bitter coup of the croce: And
ve quha professis our selfis to be his members

               QVhat dois thou call ane vark of Supererogation?
            
            
               B.
               It is that quhairto ane man is not obleist
and gif he leue it vndone he incurris not the
syn of omission, or neglecting his bund deutie,S. Matth. 19.
as the vark quhilk Christ gaue the zung
man counsal to do, saying: Gif thou vald be
perfit, sell al thaj thing is that thou hes, giue
thame vnto the pure. Cum follou me, and
thou sall haue ane threasor in heauin. And
the passionis quhair of S. Paul vryttis in this
maner.1. Coloss. 
                  Nou I reiose in my afflictions for zou
and I supplie in my flesch that quhilk inlaikis
of the afflictons of Christ, for his body
quhilk is the kirk. And it is maist certane,
that the Sanctis and martyrs suffe rit monie
and gret afflictions to the quhilk thay var

nocht obleist as S. Paul testifeis of him self:
that he vas not obleist to indure the paynis,
and laubour to vyn his meat be the vark of
his auin handis, quhilk notuithstanding he
did villinglie indure. Sua quhither ze vil or
not ze man confes sum varkis of supererogation:
I agrie indeid in that, that amang
zou, quha callis zonr selfis ministers of goddis
vord, thair is na varkis of supererogation,
except it be to vissie all the bancattis that ar

that it inlaikis perfection?
            
            
               B.
               Quhen hard ze euer ony Catholik man

becaus thay var vnclene of thair auin nature,

as thay affirmeid. And thairfoir S. Paull callis
this the doctrine of the deuill, and affirmes
that God hes created all meattis, and that all
the creaturis of God ar gud, and vreittand to

lord Iesus,Rom. 14. that thair is nathing vnclene of it

of S. Paul is that it is ane peruersed and vicked
doctrine to abstene from meattis as gif thay
var vnclene, or defylit in thame seluis, or created
be the deuill, as the Marcionitis and Manichaeanis
maist planelie affirmed. Bot to abstene
from certane meattis noth becaus thay

Thairfoir sayis S. Augustin,Aug. lib. 3

and thame quha abstenis from meattis quhilk

God hes created, saying that God hes noth
created thame, for the quhilk caus, that is the
doctrine of the prophetis and Apostlis, bot
this is the doctrine of leing deuillis. Heirof
euerie man may persaue that this place of scripture
is alluterlie peruerted be zou, and falslie
applyit to the Catholique kirk, quhilk neuer
did forbid onie kynd of meate as gif it had

in scotland. ze may thane esilie persaue houvranguslie
ze obiect this place of S. Paull aganis

sen na catholique hes euer teached that the

Thairfoir S. Augustine sayis ansuering to heretikis

For first Christ did abrogat the paschal lamb
quhilk vas the figure of his bodie, and fulfilled
that thing quhilk vas praefigurat Sua
necessarlie according to his auin vordis, that
quhilk he gaue to his disciples vas nocht the

the auld testament, and institute the coup of

                  t did mair perfytlie
represent the blude of Christ nor vyne can

thing quhilk Christ befoir his death vas villling

to recommend vnto his best boloued
discipilles, and quhilk he vald thay did in remembrance
of his deth and Passion quhil
his cumming agane to iuge the hail varld,
sua he did speik maist cleirlie and planelie

as he forkneu all thingis to cum, and louit

cleirlie prouin of thevordis follouing. Becaus

               To cum to the last pairt concerning the

And thaireftir he had na feir, bot proposed bauldlie
vnto all men this neu glose, that he had
resaued from the hand of the angell, euin as
Mahomet ressauit his Alcoran from the hand
of God. I remember that S. August vreittis
of ane callit Vincentius ane Ptiscillianist quha
affirmir in lyk maner that ane Angell had apeirit
vnto him,August contra vincent. and learnit him the richt interpretatione
of the scripture, to quhom he
ansuerit vitht S. Paull,S. Paul. gal. 1. that albeit ane Angell
of heuin reueill onie thing attour that quhilk
is preched, ve aucht not to beleue the sam.
Bot that ze be eschamit to eite S. Augustine
in tymes cumming, I vil propose vnto zou
thre, or four places maist cleir, and manifest for
the confirmatione of the treu, and Catholik
doctrine. The first is, out of his expositione of
the threttie thre Psalme, quhair he sayis that
suppose it be impossibill that onie mortall
man beir him self in his auin handis,Aug. in ps
                        •
                      33 that
Christ notuithstanding buir him self in his
auin handis, quhen he said (this is my bodie:)
gif he bure onlie ane figure of his bodie as
ze allege, euerie man micht haue done alsmekill
as he: The secund is vpone the nyntie

aucht Psalme, quhair he sayis that Christ left
vs that same self flesche,August in psal. 98. quhairin he valkit
in this varld, and that na man eitis of that
flesche except first he adore the same. The
thrid, is in the thrid buik of the Trinitie, quhair
he vryttis in this maner:Aug. lib. 3 de trinit. cap. 10 gif it vat proponit
to ane chyld be sik authoritie as he behouit
to beleue, quhais bodie and quhais blude
ve rak in the Sacrament, gif the chyld had
neuer vndirstand in quhat maner and liknes
Christ had apperit in the earth, he vald beleue
assuritlie that Christ had appeirit in sik forme
as he is schauin in be the handis of the preist,
and that it quhilk is in the chalice, had
sprung out from the vound of sik ane bodie.
The fourt is in the tuentie buke of the Citie
of God,Aug. lib. 20 de cinit. Dei. cap. 17. quhair he sayis that the bodie of
Christ, quhilk is nou offerit in the sacrifice of
the kirk, and geuin in the sacramēt to all quha
resauis it, vas praefigurat be all the sacrifices of
the auld lau. Considder vith zour self gif the
sacrifices of the auld lau, var figuris of ane figure,
and nocht of the treu bodie of Christ, I
micht cite monie vtheris gif I pleised, bot thir
ar sufficient to schau zour impudence: that albeit
ze neuer red S. Augustine, zit ze ar nocht
eschamit to cite him in zour praechingis, and

bodie, thairfoir it is in ane propir place, and

is, that the propositionis thairof

indeuit vith the natural licht of vndirstanding,
may deny the same, quhilk inlaikis in

him self prouis that zour proposition in this
zour praetendit demonstration is fals, seing
that the heauin quhilk is ane verie natural

at the lest to the groundis of natural philososophie:
Considering euin as the philosophouris
teachis that euerie bodie suld be in ane

to haue ane place aequall vnto it self in sik
maner that the place be nather of les, nor mair

nor the natural dimensionis of it requiris,

Than be the lik pouar ane bodie may

propositione treu that euerie natural bodie as
natural, is in ane place, sua that it may not be
in monie, it seruis na thing for zour purpose:
Becaus Christis bodie is substātiallie present,

quhairbie it surpassis the maner and cō

the occupatione of ane place, euin according
to the menīg of the philosophoris, is nocht of
the nature or substance of ane bodie, vnles ze
be infidelis, ze can nocht deny, bot God be his
omnipotēt pouar may separat Christis bodie
from the occupatione of ane place, it being
onlie ane accident of the same. And gif ze
ground all zour fayth on naturall reasonis, I
feir that ze dout not onlie of this mysterie of
the real presence of Christis bodie in the sacrament
of the altar, bot also of the Natiuitie

Becaus the lyk, ze strenthiar demonstrationis

And this I can nocht praetermit that ze

breid,S. Paul. 1. Cor. 10. quhilk ve brek, is it nocht the participatione
of Christis bodie? And in the actis of the Apostlis it
is vrittin,Act. 2. that the faythful did perseueir in the brei-King

quhat sens the name of breid suld be tane in
thir places alleged be zou, sayand, I am the
breid quhilk is cummit out of heauin, and
the breid quhilk I sall giue zou is my fleshe,
that salbe geuin for the lyf of the varld: for as
the maist commone and principal nuriture is
breid, sua the fleshe of Christ being the nuritur
of our saulis, and bodeis to immortalitie,
is callit breid be him self. Efter the quhilk
maner of speiking his Apostlis, and the Euā

callis also his fleshe, breid. And thairfoir,

that he vas corruptibill or material breid,1. Cor. 10. Act. 2. sua
quhen in the scripture his fleshe is callit breid,
as in the places alledged be zou, it follouis
not, that the vord signifeis corruptibill or material
breid, becaus efter the maner of speiking
of the hebreuis, quhilk Christ and his
discipiles follouit, quhatsumeuer nuriture, in
the hebreu toung is callit generalie 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that
is breid, sua, as ze may esilie persaue, zour argument
is of na strenth, ze the scripture it self
geuis vs ane sufficient argument that thaj
zour alleged places suld nocht be vnderstand
of material breid, seing S. Paull sayis that the
breid quhilk ve brek is the communication
of Christis bodie, gif it be material breid, it
may not be the communicatione of Christis
bodie, And in that same place ve ar all ane
breid, and ane bodie, quhasoeuer ar maid participant
of ane breid, and ane bodie. Quhair of
it follouis that the self same breid and body is
geuin to vs all, vtheruyse ve could not be ane
breid and ane bodie mair be the participation
of this sacrament, nor be the eitting of commone
breid, quhilk is expres aganis the mening
of S. Paull. sua gif it var ane material

               B.
               I vil produce thir inuincible argumentis
quhilk Sathan zour maister and ze sall neuer
be abil to refel. The first dois consist in thir
vordis: My flesch is verie meat,S. Ioan. 6. and my blude
is verie drink. This flesch and blude quhairof
he speak is in thir vordis ar reallie geuin to
vsin this sacramēt, or ellis thay maj not be the
verie fude of our saulis. Bot thay may not be
reallie geuin in the sacramēt, gif the substance
of the bread, quhilk is bot corporal fude and
maj not nurish the Saul, remane vnchaingeit,
Quhairfore transubstantiation in this sacrament
is necessar. The secund argument
consist is in thir vordis: As the leuing father
hes s
                        •
                     nd, me and I leue be the father,S. Ioan. 6. euin sua
he quha eatis me, Sal leue be me also. Bot
the sone in diuinitie proceidis of his father in
sik sort that he ressauis his hail substance of
him, and is of ane indiuisible substance vith
his father: Quhairfore necessar it is, that be eating
of this sacrament according to the meaning
of Christ, ve ar maid ane substance vith
his manlie nature, hauing our hail substance
of him insafar as it is immortal. The third argument

is contenit in thir vordis, Not as
zour fathers eatit Manna,S. Ioan. 6. and deit, for the
difference assignit in this place consistis ather
in the distinction of the nature of that quhilk
is geuin in the sacrament of the altar, and
the substance of māna that the ane hes pouar
to aboleis death, quickin, and giue lyf: The
vther had not the same: or ellis this difference
is nane, Becaus gif the substance and nature
of the sacrament be corruptible, lyk as the
vnbeleuaris in the auld lau deit efter thay had
eatin Manna, and the beleuaris leuit be faith
onlie, and not be verteu of eating of Manna,
sua sal ve say of thame quha eitis Christis body,
quhil as the contrar heirof is manifestlie
prouin be this testimonie. The fourt is, that
Christ quhen he tuk bread in his handis, he
blissit it be thir vordis:S. Matth. 26. (This is my body,) the
quhilk blissing not being in vane, bot hauing
efficacie and strenth to do that thing quhilk
it signifeis, it behouis of necessitie that
the breid be chaingeit in his body: Bot ze quha
acknaulegis na thing in this sacrament bot
onlie breid, ar maist iniurious vnto Christ, taking

Quhairfore at his latter supper geuing thā

As amang vtheris vreittis the halie doctoris
Ambrose,Ambro. li. 4. de sacra men. Damascen, and Theophilactus, bot

                  say that god
may not caus the accidentis haue existence
vithout the auin proper inherence:Damasc. lib. 4. c. 14. Theoph. in Luc. c. 14. Considering
that god, quha is the caus of conseruation
of al thing is, and misteris not the concurrence
of his creaturis, euin as he cōseruis the
accidentis be the substance as ane ordinar meane,
sua he maj conserue the accident be his
omnipotent pouar vithout the substance, or
ellis it behouit him necessarlie to haue mister
of ane creature for conseruation of another,
quhilk is ane maist horrible blasphemie. Mairattour
the philosopheurs thame selfis teathis
that the substance and accident ar tua
thingis Reallie distingueist: Quhat then maj
be mair esie to god, nor that he be his omnipotent
pouar separat the ane from the vther?
especiallie sence it is als necessar according to
the ordinar course of nature, that ane substance,
haue the auin subsistance, as that the accidentis
haue thair inherence. Bot ze ar constranit

to grant: that ane substance maj be vithout
the natural subsistance thairof, as in the
incarnation of Christ, thair vas treulie the humane
nature, and zit it vas denudit of the proper
subsistance, vnles ze grant vith Nestorius
that in Christ, lyk as thair is tua naturis, sua
thair is tua subsistencis or personagis. Quhairfore
the accidentis in lyk maner may be vithout
inherence, sen as teachis the maist learnit
scolemen: the nature of the accident consistis
not in this, that it hes actual inherence,
bot that it may haue inherence in ane substance.
As the accident is oftymes definit vithout
the actual inherence thairof, quhilk
could not be gif it var of the nature of the same:
As quhen the mathematicians definis
thair quantiteis and figuris, as Aristotle him
self teachis, thay mak ane abstraction from al
inherence, and zit neuertheles thay cumpas the
nature of the accident quhilk thay define. And
I meruel of zou, quha professis Zour seluis
philosophors, that ze vil not grant that thing
to the omnipotencie of god, quhilk manie learnit
philosophors grantis sum tyme to be
agreable to the natural ordour of thingis appoint it
be god, as amang vthers manie of the
quhilkis Aristotle mak is mention in the fourt
buik of the phisikis quhais opinion Philoponus
that vas ane Christian man and ane
maist learn it philosophour follouis,Philoponus in 4. Phys. Basil. homil. 2. in hexam. and S. Basile
in the secund homilie of his hexameron
affermis: that the licht quhilk vas first creatit

be god, had na substance quhairin it had inherence,
and adionis thairto that god may
mair eselie separat reallie the licht frō the substance
quhairin it hes inhaerence, nor ve may
separat the ane from the vther in thocht and
cogitation. Simplicius also, and Ammonius
quha var gret philosophors, in the declaration
of Aristotle sayis: that ane accident may pas
out of ane substance to another, quhilk is al
alyk according to the grund of Metaphisik,
as to be seperat from ane substāce. And suppose
I could not atteine to the vay hou the accident
may be separat from the substance, zit I
vald grund my faith vpon the speiking of god
him self, quha is infallible treuth, and vork is
for the confort of man thai thing is, that he is
vnable to conceaue, not regairding zour diffidence,
proceding as ze think of natural reasons,
quhilk being veil tryit, ar fund in na vther
thing bot phantastical captions and illusions.
For gif Abraham had bene mouit be natural

            OF THE SACRIFICE OF THE
MESSE.
            CHAP. XIIII.
            
               M.
               APprouis thou the institution of that Idolatrie,
quhilk the Papistis callis the Messe, seing thair
is na mention maid thairof in the vrittin vord?
            
            
               B.
               I acknaulege the offering of Christis bodie
vnder the forme of breid and of his blude
vnder the forme of vyne,Luc. 22 as ane propiciator
sacrifice for the quick and the deid,Rom. 14 as he deit
for saluation of thame bayth, quhilk is callit
the Messe, for this vord Missah signifeing ane
voluntar offering as ve reid in the 16 of Deut
is retenit be the Christian Doctors,Deut. 16 lyk as sindrie
vthers, Alleluia, osanna, Amen. &c.
            
            
               M.
               Hou prouis thou that Christ offer it his body in
the latter suppar?
            
            
               B.
               It is manifest be the Euangelist S. Luc. quhair
our saluiour commandit S. Petir and S.
Iohne his Disciplis to prepare ane hous quhait
he sould eit the Paschal lamb,S. Luc. 22. quhilk [as is
is thair testefeit] vas offerit before it vas eitin,Exod. 12
according to the institution of god as ve reid

in the tuelf chap of exod. Quhair
                     •
                  ore it behouit
our saluiour Iesus Christ to eat the Paschal
lambe vpon ane Altar, insafar as it vas ane
figure, maist lyuelie representing the offering
of his bodie and eiting of the same, that
the treuth micht be correspondent to the figure,
it vas necessar that Christis bodie (als realle
eitin in the latter suppar vnder the forme
of breid, as the body of the lambe) sould be
first offerit vnder the same forme vpon the Altar
quhair upon before vas offerit the body of
the lambe, being the figure nou aboleist be
substitution of the treuth. Insafar then as thir
foisaidis be manifest, It is necessar that the
euangelical preistis hauing the Auctoritie of
Christ, and assistance of the halie ghaist, vpon
altaris offer Christis bodie and blude, quhilk
vas sched vpon the Croce for the synnis of
monie.Hebr. 13. for as vryttis S. Paul, ve haue ane altar
of the quhilk it is not leisum to thame to eit
quha seruis in the tabernacle meaning of this
sacrifice, considering thair is na vther sacrifice
except this quhair of it is not lesum to thame
to eit quha seruis in the tabernacle. In lyk maner
ve reid hou Melchisedec the heich preist
of God did offer breid and vyne as ane figure
of this sacrifice,Genes. 14. sua Christ being ane preist efter
the ordore of Melchisedec,Psal. 109. it behouit that
he offerit ane clene and vnbludie sacrifice or
ellis the figure had not bene fulfillit be the veritie.
Nou schau me quhen he did offer ane
vnbludie sacrifice efter the ordor of Melchisedec,

gif he did not offer it in the latter suppar.
Sua ze denying this tak auay the eternal preistheid
of Christ efter the ordour of Melchisedec,
and cōsequentlie makis the vord of God,
and prophecie spokin of him to be alluterlie
fals. For confirmation heirof I may produce
to zou the hail ancient fathers as,Iraeneus lib. 4. cōtr. Valent. cap. 32. Iraene quha
sayis that Christ in his latter supper did institute
the sacrifice of the neu testament, the
quhilk the kirk hauing ressauit from the
Apostlis offeris euerie quhair vnto God. Arnobius
vryttand vpon the hundreth nyne
psalme say is that the sacrifice efter the ordor
of Melchisedec,Arnob. in psal. 109. quhilk vas institute be Christ
ī the suppar is nou offer it thruch the hail vard.
And. S. Cyprian, Melchisedec sayis he, offerit
breid and vyne,Cypprian. ep. 1. c. 9. quhilk sacrifice our saluiour
did fulfill in his latter supper, quhen he offer it
that quhilk vas prefigurat be Melchisedec, to
vit, his bodie and blude. And. S. Hierom in
his epistle to Marcella:S. Hieron. ad Marcel. Gif thou vil cum (sayis
he) to Ierusalem, thair vil thou se the Citie of
Melchisedec, quha in prefiguration of the sacrificie
quhilk is nou offerit be the Christianis
in the bodie and blude of the Lord,August. in psal. 33. did offer
breid and vyne. S. Augustine vryttand vpon
the threttie 
                     •
                  hrie psalme: The preisteid (say is
he) efter the ordor of Aaron is tane auay, and
nou euerie quhair thair is ane sacrifice offerit
efter the ordor of Melchisedec.Malachie 1. In lik maner
the Prophet Malachie did forespeik of this
sacrifice saying: In euerie place fra the sone rysing

to the going to of the same, thair salbe
offerit to my name ane clene sacrifice, The
quhilk according to the interpretatione of
the hail ancient fathers is vnderstand of the
sacrifice of the bodie and blude of Iesus Christ,
quhilk is offerit euerie quhair. And I vald desire
zou to schau me of quhat vther sacrifice
the prophet could meane: he could not meane
of the sacrifice of prayer, becaus that sacrifice
vas before in the auld testament, sua
that it could not be ane sacrifice of the neu
testament: And the sacrifice of payer to pretermit
that it is not properlie callit ane sacrifice:
according to the lau of nature, it man be necessarlie
in al religion, sua it had bene na prophecie
to haue forespokin that sik ane sacrifice
sould haue bene amang the Christians. And
ze zour seluis teachis that al our prayers, and
quhatsumeuir varkis ve do, ar syn in the sicht
of God and vnclene in thame selfis, sua the
prophet could not forespeik euin according
to zour meaning, of payers or ony vther varkis
quhilk sould proceid of vs, nor zit could
he mean of the sacrifice of Christon the Croce,
becaus that sacrifice vas offerit onlie in ane
place, and this sould be offerit euerie quhair:
Then necessarlie ar ze constranit to acknaulege
ane vther sacrifice efter the ordor of Melchisedec,
baith according to the Doctors of
the synagogue of the auld testament before
the cumming of Christ, and al thame that hes

               B.

is callit ane preist for euer efter the ordor of
Melchisedec. sua that the sacrifice of the Messe
makis vs participant of the fructis and benefetis
of the gret pouar and efficacie of the sacrifice
of the Croce. Quhairfore ze sould be

               M.
               Gif the Messe be ane sacrifice propiciator for the
quik and the dead institute be Christ, quhat is the
caus that the Euangelistis, and Apostlis makis not
als oft mention of Christis sacrifice vith his Disciplis,
vnder the formes of breid and vyne, as of his suppar?
            
            
               B.
               Thay not onlie mak als oft mention of
his sacrifice as of his suppar, bot far ofter. For
the institution of Christ at his latter suppar
contenis the formes of speiking, quhilk properlie
pertenis to ane sacrifice,Luc. 22. as (This is my
body quhilk is geuin or offerit for zou. This
is my blude quhilk is sched for zou) Mairouer
it is manifest be the Doctrene of S. Paull,Heb. 7. that
baith the sacrifice according to the ordor of
Aaron, and according to the ordor of Melchisedec
quhilk vas diuers, for the ane had beistis
that var slane, the vther breid and vine, var figuris
of Christis sacrifice. Quhairfore be reason
he substitute the treuth, and aboleist all figuris,
he behouit in his sacrifice be the omnipotent
pouar of the halie ghaist, turne the
breid and vyne in his body and blude: vtheruyse
it had bene bot the same figure, quhilk

vas before quhen Melchisedec maid oblation.
For na religion, nor lau can be vithout sacrifice
it being the cheif vorschipping of God,
sua that the auld being chaingeit in the neu,
it is necessar that in the place of the auld sacrificis,
ane neu sacrifice sould succeid, quhilk
sould lest sa lang as the lau lestis.Aug. li. 17 de Ciuit. Dei c. 20. Thairfore S.
Augustin sayis that in place of al the sacrificis
of the auld testament this sacrifice of the body
and blude of Christ efter the ordor of Melchisedec
succeidis. And the halie vryttar Cyprian,Cyprian. de coen. d

The Capernaitis (sayis he) beleuit that
thay sould haue eitin the body of Christ in
sik maner that thay sould haue consumit the
same, quhilk vas ane thing impossibill. Becaus

And Leo vryttis that Christ in the meantyme
quhen the Ieuis var thinking to betray
him, did ordane the sacrifice of his bodie and
blude, to the end that the Christian religion
sould haue ane perpetual sacrifice, quhilk it
micht offer to God. I micht cite zou manie
vthers gif I pleisit of the ancient vryttaris to
the same purpose, var not I feir it sould turne
to zour damnation, quha vil trou na thing
bot that quhilk ze find in zour maister and
idol Iohne Caluin. Quhairfore it is necessar
that the successors of Christis halie Apostlis
haue ane outuart sacrifice vith ceremoneis,

contenand the treuth and licht for the schaddouis
of the auld lau. Becaus as ve reid in the
Actis of the Apostlis, the primitiue kirk had

that the Ceremonie or sacrifice is not
euil, becaus it is vsurpit be the gentelis and
infidellis, bot becaus it is vsurpit be thame to
ane vrang and peruersit end, to vit for the honoring
of thair Idollis, sua that the self same
thing being applyit to the honor and seruice
of god, is gude and louabill, [Qui Christianas

the Christian vryttingis of the neu and auld
testament, reprouis not this in the sacrilegious
ritis of the paganis, that thay big kirkis

bot becaus thay do all thir thingis to honor

                  [Cum haec exhibentur Deo secundum

And hou sall he quha suppleis the place of the Idiot,

               B.
               Thair be tua Kynd of prayeris in the kirk,
the ane is priuat, quhilk euerie man sayis be
him self: the vthir is publik quhilk the preistis
sayis in name of the hail kirk: As to the
priuat prayeris, na Catholik denyis, bot it is
verie expedient that euerie man pray in his
auin toung, to the end he vndirstand that quhilk
he sayis, and that thairbie the interior
prayer of the hairt may be the mair valk in nit,
and conseruit the bettir, and gif onie man

pray in ane vther toung, it is also expedient
that he vnderstand the mening of the vordis
at the lest. For the quhilk caus in the Catholik
kirk the parentis or godfatheris ar obleist,
to learne thame quhom thay hald in baptisme
the formes of prayeris, and Beleif, and instruct
thame sufficientlie thairin, sua that thay
vndirstād the same: Albeit the principal thing
quhilk god requiris is the hai
                     •
                  t, that suppois
he quha prayis vndirstand nocht perfytlie the
vordis quhilk he speikis, zit god quha lukis
in the hairt, vill nocht lat his prayer be in vane.
As to the publik prayeris of the kirk, it is
not necessar that the pepill vndirstand thame,
becaus it is nocht the pepill quha prayis, bot
the preistis in the name of the hail kirk, and
it is aneuche that thay assist be deuotione liftand
vp thair myndis to god or saying thair
auin priuat oraesonis, and that be thair deuotione
thay may be maid participant of the
kirk: As in the synagogue of the Ieuis, the
peopill kneu not, quhat all thay cerimoneis
signifeit, quhilk vas keipit be the preistis and
vtheris in offering of thair sacrifices, and vther
vorshipping of God, and zit thay did assist vnto
thame, ze sum of the preistis thame selfis
miskneu the significatione of thir cerimoneis:
Than gif it vas aneuche to the pepill to
vndirstand that in sik ane sacrifice consisted
the vorshipping of god, suppois thay had not
sua cleir ane vndirstanding of euerie thing
that vas done thairin, sua in the catholik kirk,

quhen the people assistis to the sacrifice of the
Mess, thay acknaulege that thairbie god is
vorshippit, and that it is institute for the remembrance
of Christis death, and passione,
Albeit thay vndirstād nocht the Latine toung
zit thay ar not destitut of the vtilitie and fruit
thairof: And it is nocht vithout greit caus that
as in the inscriptione and titil quhilk Pilat
fixed vpone the croce of Christ Iesus, thir thre
toungis var vrittin latine, Greik, and Hebreu,
sua in the sacrifice, and publik prayeris of the
kirk, thay ar cheiflie retenit, for the conseruatione
of vnitie in the kirk, and nationis amāg
thame selfis: for gif al thingis var turnit in the
propir lāgage of euerie cuntrey, na man vald
studie to the latine toung, and thairbie al communicatione
amangis Christiane pepil vald
schortlie be tane auay, and thaireftir greit

prayeris and seruice ar keipit mair perfytlie in
thair auin integritie vithout al corruptione:
for gif ane natione vald eik, or pair onie thīg,
that vald be incontinent remarkit, and reprouit
be vther nationis, quhilk culd not be, gif
euerie natione had al thai thingis turnit in the
auin propir langage, as ze may se be experience,
gif ze vald confer the prayeris of zour deformit
ki
                     •
                  kis, togidder vith the innumerabil
trāslationis of the psalmes, quhilk ar chaingit
according to euerie lāgage in the quhilk thay
ar turnit. It is not than vithout greit caus, and
ane special instinctione of the halie Ghaist

that thir toungis foirspokin hes bene retened
as thay vil be retenit to the end of the varld.
And quhen the Ieuis sall imbrace the Euāgel,
than sal the sacrifice, and vther publik prayeris
be in the hebreu toung, according to that
quhilk I said befoir, that on the Croce of
Christ thaj thrie toungis onlie var vrittin, to
signifie that the kirk of Christ suld vse thay
thre toungis cheiflie in his vorshipping, as
the neu, and auld testament ar in thir thre toungis
in greitast authoritie amangis al pepill.
Nou to cū to the first pairt of zour obiection,
ze proue na thing except onlie that he quha
prayis suld nocht be aluterlie rude or ignorāt
of that toung in the quhilk he prayis, quhilk I
do alreddie grāt to zou, As to thevthir pairt of
zour argument, I confess indeid that that place
aucht to be vndirstand of the publique
prayeris of the kirk, bot zit it seruis nathing
to zour purpose, bot is rather repugnant to
the same, and prouis that the cōmon seruice
of the kirk vas nocht than in the vulgar
langage quhilk euerie man vndirstude, bot in
ane vthir langage quhilk vas nocht sua commone
to euerie man. For the vndirstanding
of this I reid in Chrysostom,Chrysost. in 14. prio. ad cor. and vther anciēt
vryttaris that amangis vther giftis quhilk vas

Nou sen this gift of prayer remanis nocht

this distinctione that almaist in euerie natione

as testifeis S. Hierom in his commentaris
on the epistle to the Galatianis that the Galatianis

that the greik toung, and throuche the haill
Orient albeit thair vas ane greit nomber of

of Britanie vryttis that thair is fyue

toung, the Scottis toung, the pichtis toung,
and the latine toung, not that the latene
toung vas vulgare to onie pepill of Britanie,
bot becaus it vas commone to thame all: and
for that caus it is callit thair toung: Sua Sanct
Paull quhē he vill that the seruice of the kirk

that it suld nocht be in ane toung quhilk is

quhilk is nocht aluyse vnknauin to the pepill,
as throuche the haill Orient vas the greik

The quhilk interpretatione is gathered maist
cleirlie, becaus that euin in S. Paulis dayes
throuche all the Orient the publique prayeris

Albeit thair vas innumerabill vulgar toungis

that euerilk cuntrey did thane turne

in the Occident sen the fayth vas first plā
                  ted,

in the publique prayeris of the kirk bot the latene

testifeis that in his dayes throuch al Afrik the

Mairatour quhen S. Paull sayis, he that suppleis

Amen to thy benedictione, gif he vndirstand

S Paul callis him ane Idiot quha vnderstandis

of that toung in the quhilk the seruice of the

Sanct Paull schauis maist cleirlie that sic seruice
vas not exercised in ane vulgar toung,

bo

                   in ane vther quhilk vas not commone

said is, in Scotland, and throuch the hail Occident:
Albeit it vas not in the contrare extremitie
strange, or barbaruse. Bot sen ze haue
euer mair this place in zour mouthe, and dissauis
thairbie the pure peopil, I am constranit
to schau that in zour neu deformed kirk it is
alluterlie peruerted be zou, and the rest of the
minister is, becaus quhair the greik and latene
text hes, He quha suppleis the place of ane
Idiote hou sall he say Amen, zour ministeris
of Geneua in monie of thair By bilis, hes turnit
it maist deceatfullie and malitiouslie, he that
is ane Idiott hou sall he say Amen: euin as gif
thair var na difference betuix ane Idiot and
him quha suppleis the place of ane Idiot.
Mairouer the benediction to the quhilk S.
Paull sayis Amen, suld be ansuered, is nauyse
practised in zour deformet kirkis and nather
zour Idiotis, nor thay that suppleis the place
of zour Idiotis Ansueris Amen, as Sanct Paul

So be it, quhilk is plane repugnant to his mening,
and the practeise of the haill kirk, sen ze
can not excuse zour selfis to say that S. Paul
vrait to thame quha spak the Hebreu toung,
as Amen is Hebreu considering he vraitt to
the Corinth. quha had thair publique seruice
in greik, and not in hebreu, geuing vs ane
sufficient argument, that that vord Amen
aucht to be retened in al langages, as it hes

euer bene retenet befoir zou amang all Christian
men. And as the Euangelistis quha vreit

In all the prayeris of the vniuersall

bot the Papis of Rome hes borrouit from the gentiles

of thair religione, zit quhen it pleased

God to tak auay the persecutione, and illuminat
the hart of the Emperore Cōstantinus
Magnus to imbrace the Christian religione
and to be ane instrument of the furthsetting
of it, than as the Christianis began to big maist
magnifict templis, sua began thay to adorne
thair altaris vith gold and pretious stanes,
and to cleyth thame maist richelie and to mak
Chalices of gold and siluer in mair quantitie
and aboundance nor befoir. For lang afoir
Constantinus Magnus the Christianis in thair
sacrifices vsed to haue Chalices of gold as amangis

Thay say that this is the maner and

discipline of zour couenant, that the Bischopis
makis sacrifice in veschelis of gold, that

ze vill find hou that the halie voman
Helena his mother did decore the Altaris

And S. Ambrose vrittis that in sum caices

necessitie of the pure (Tunc enim vas Dominici

I acknauledge the veschell that contenis the
blud of the lord, quhen in thame bayth I behald

may redeme him from the ennimie, quhom
the blude hes redemit from the ennimie.
And Athanasius vryttand of the persecution
of the Arrianis,Athana. in epist. ad Marcum. vitnessis that the Arrianis

of all precious and riche apparell, and that
zour auin priuat housis be mair magnifict
nor the house quhilk is dedicat to the honoring

learned the maner of the apparelling of our

the infidelis hes lerned that from the pepill
of god, as Numa Pompilius did learne ane
greit pairt of tha thingis quhilk he ordinit in
the Citie of Rome for the vorshipping of the
Idolis out of the bukis of Moyses. Ze of the

To quhom S. Augustine did ausuer that our

                   alledgit in thy Ansuere tua thingis,

quhilk in my iugement ar disagreand from the spirit
of god, first that Presbyter, in the primiture kirk, vas
ane preist, and leuit as ane kirk man, quhill as according
to the signification of the greik vord, it is callit
ane elder, sik as ve chuse zeirlie in our reformit Kirkis.
The secund is, that ze vald retene that vnctione,
quhairof the Apostle spekis, the verteu thairof

               B.
               As to the first, it is manifest that in the primitiue
kirk (Presbyter) vas nocht tane for ane
Soutar, Tailzeour, or Merchand hauand ane
mechanik vocatione, zeirlie chosin, as ze do
in zour deformit kirk,Tim. 1. epi. chap. 5. bot for ane Pastore

thairto:Ephes. 5. I meruel hou ze deny it to be ane
sacrament, cheiflie sen S. Paull mening of
Mariage, sayis, It is ane gret Sacrament: or
hou can ze beleue that Mariage hes na grace

quhilk it hes nocht amangis the Ieuis and gē

or that the Christianis ar nocht sanctifeit

Childrene vnto Christ,August. Lib. de bono con. cap. 24. aganis the mening of
S. Paul in his epistle to the Ephesianis? Thairfoir
S. Augustin sayis that Mariage in the halie
citie of god, may in nauyse be dissoluit,
becaus it is ane sacrament: and as Christ can

nocht be separat from his kirk, bot is conioynit
vith hir be ane insolubil band, sua the

               M.
               As to the testimonie of Paul,Ephe. 5. it seruis not

               Our maister Christ is onlie head of the kirk,
quhairfoir the authoritie of the Paip is vsurpit, and
tyrannicall.
            
            
               B.
               Zour proudnes lattis zou nocht vndirstand

head of the kirk fra quhom all grace and spirituall
giftis dois proceid throuche the haill

zit onie mortal man can be head of the
kirk: bot as to the exterioure gouernement
ād administratione thairof Christ, nocht beīg
vith vs in ane corporal and sensibil maner,
to quhom ve may haue our recours in al materis
and difficulteis, he hes left vs ane Vicare
in his place, quhom in this respect ve cal the
heid of the kirk as subordinat vnto Christ,
and depending on him: quhairin he hes schauin
his gret lufe and Cheritie touardis his
spous the kirk, and touardis hir pure flok, 
                     •
                  euing
thame in his place ane to quhom thay

mycht euer haue recurse, quhatsumeuer difficultie
micht occur: And thaifoir sayis S.
Ambrose, speking of S. Petir (Christus reliquit
nobis Petrum, tanquam vicatium amoris
sui) that is, Christ hes left vs Petir in his place
as vicare of his lufe touardis vs, quhom he
constitute cheif pastore vndir him selff, saying
Sathan desyrit to riddil zou as quheit,Luc. 22. bot I
prayit for the Petir, that thy fayth inlaik
nocht: Of the quhilk ze may vndirstād esilie,
that suppose Christ be head of the kirk, zit
that it is na vyse repugnant that he haue ane
Vicar in his place for the exteriore gouernement
as said is: lyk as the king is head of his
realme, suppoise he haue ane lieutenēt vndir
him: zour argument than as ze may persaue,
is of na strenth, for in ane maner Christ is
callit head of the kirk, and in ane vthir maner
the Paip is callit head of the sam, lyk as
ze zour selfis do cal zour ministeris, Pastoris
of four kirkis (suppoise thay feid thame veray
euil) and zit ze vill nocht deny bot Christ is
Pastore of thame: For it is all ane thing to be
callit pastore of the kirk, and head of the kirke,
considering the pastore man gyde and gouerne
his floke: quhilk is the propir office and
devtie of the head in respect of the rest of
the bodie.
            
            
               Bal.
               Is nocht this ane sufficient argument to say,
Christ onlie vas head of the kirk, thairfoir Petir in
nauyse micht be heid of the sam, nor be consequēce his
successoris?
            
            
               
               B.
               Gif this be ane sufficient argument, if follouis
alsueil Christ is onlie Pastore of zour
four kirkis, thairfoir ze ar nocht pastoris of
thame: gif be this argument ze proue that
the Paip is nocht head of the kirk, ze may
proue lykuyse that ze ar nocht pastoris of
zour four kirkis, quhilk I trou be veray treu:
Becaus ze can schau na authoritie of goddis
vord, apoyntand ane minister to four kirkis.
            
            
               Bal.
               Our Maister Christ in the Euangell of Luc. Denyis,
that thair suld be onie head or Prince amang
the Apostlis,Luc. 22. as is in ciuil policie. For thair it is vryttin.
Thair arase ane contentione amang the Discipiles
quhilk of thame appeirit to be greitast, bot he said vnto
thame, The kingis of the nationis hes dominione
ouer thame, and thay quha hes pouar ouer thame ar
callit beneficent, zit ze ar nocht suae: Bot he quha is
gretar amang zou lat him be as he quha is les, and
he quha is Prince lat him be seruand to the rest.
            
            
               B.
               This is ane commone place, quhairfra ze
souke sophisticall argumentis to dissaue the
ignorant pepill: to vit quhen as in onie place
of scripture, the abuse of ane gud thing, (sic as
is the authoritie of he preistheid quhairbie
vnitie is conseruit in the kirk of Christ) is reprouit,
to collect that the gude thing, is altogidder
denyit to haue onie profitabil vse in
the societie of mankynd, as in this place ze do
maist manifestlie. For our maist halie saluioure
Iesus Christ denyis nocht in this place, that
thair suld be ane amang the rest of the Apostlis,
eftir his departing, of gretar Authoritie

nor ane vthir, bot onlie instructis him quha
sal ressaue this praeeminent Authoritie, that
he Ioyne nocht thairuith pryd, ambitiōe, and
lifting vp of his hart, thinkand that throuche
nature, merite, or operatione of his auin,
he is mekil mair vorthie, nor the rest of his
brethene: for saying [he quha vald be Prince
amang zou, lat him be as he quha seruis] it
is necessar that ve grant sum of the Apostlis
to haue bene Prince, or ellis the instructione
var superfluous, quhil as na man is instructit:
This is mair manifest be the exēple tane from
his auin humilitie, becaus thair is na dout bot
he vas Prince amang his discipillis, zit he did
vesche thair feit, and ressonis in this place,
quhilk of the tua is gretar, quhidder he that
sittis doun, or he quha standis, and makis
seruice? bot I am in the middis of zou as he

authoritie of the bischop of Rome aboue al
vther bischopis, bot that the bischopis of Rome
did obtene that be ambitione or ane
certane priuilege, he affirmes that quhilk he
can not be abil to proue, and repugnis to al
historeis: And albeit the bischopis of Rome
had bene ambitious as he alleagis, zit it vald

And as to Celestinus vnder quhom the Concile

And zit Iohne Caluine takis on him the
bauldnes to accuse him of ambitione, quhilk

and al the fatheris of that aige did honore

first becaus he quha vas author of that fabil

                  At non Candidula, Audebertulóque.
                  Sed vtrum rogo preferam duorum?
                  Vtrum inuisere me decet priorem?
                  An quemquam tibi Candida anteponam?

the sentence, bot put it also to executione,
that is, that he puneis according to the

as be death, banisment, or sik punitione,
bot the vryttin vord hes nocht sik pouar or

ve ar sufficientlie instructed that in al our
controuerseis, quhilk euer suld occur, for
establishing our conscience, ve suld haue recourse
to the successoris of the Apostlis, as
the lauchful iudge to quhom Christ hes promised
the assistance of the halie Ghaist to
the end of the varld:Ephes. 4. and S. Paul to the Ephesianis
testifeis (that doctoris and pastoris ar
apoynted be god to his kirk, to the effect that
ve be nocht careit auay vith euerie vind of

euerie ane quha plesis may discerne the

my argument is this, that ve ancht to haue ane

thair vald neuer ane process be endit befoir

nor ane secular king or prince hes of the Ciuile
administratione of his cōmoneueil. And
for conclusione, ze can nocht deny, bot the
vtyttin vord it self, may be callit in dout be
heretikis: As the Marcionitis, and Manichaeanis

Apocalypse: and vtheris, vther pairtis of the
scripture: Nou I demād of zou, quha sal be iudge

can nocht be iudge, as ze persaue zour self:
than necessarlie ze man acknauledge sum

denyis the epistle of S. Iames, quhat argument

Caluin zour maister hes eikit and paired framonie

in feu vordis: The iudge quhilk is appoynted

quhatsumeuer controuersie dois occurr, and
condem for haeretikis, quhasoeuer aucht to

               Ze cū nou asvther haeretikis, speciallie the

Donatistis did befoir, to ane inuisibil kirk,
quhilk errore is sufficientlie refuted be S. Augustine
vrytand aganis thame: And siclyk be
our saluiour in the Euāgel of S. Mattheu:S. Mat. 18 [Bot
gif he heir zou nocht declair it vnto the kirk]
quhilk command na man could obey, gif the
kirk var inuisibil. And gif it had bene than
inuisibil as ze alledge, it had seruit na thing at
al to thame, quha had bene baptized be haeretikis:
becaus thay could nocht adioyne thame
seluis to ane inuisibil kirk: and sua could
nocht attene to saluatione, nocht being incorporat
in the bosum of the kirk. As gif ane
Ieu or ane Turk, had bene mouit to imbrace
the religione of Christ, and tobe incorporat
into his kirk, gif his kirk had bene inuisibil
vpone the face of the earth, hou could he haue
adioynit him self to it? I meruel gretumlie of
zour blindnes, hou ze persaue nocht that the
hail prophecies of the kingdome of Christ,
vald haue bene in vain, gif his kingdome
had bene inuisibil: for ane prophecie mā be of
tha thingis, quhilk may be sene and persauit
be our sensis and experience, vtheruyse euerie
man micht be ane Prophete, and foirspeke of
ane thing to cum: and git it cum nocht to pas,
he micht say that it hes cummit to pas in verie
deid as he prophecied, bot that it vas inuisibil,
and vnknauin to the varld: thairfoir ze se in
quhat absurditeis ze rin zour selfis in, be this
zour inuisibil kirk: I vald glaidlie be resolute
of ane quaestionvith zou, quha vas it to quhō
                  
this inuisibil kirk vas first reueled? and quha
vas he that first maid it visibil to the eais of the
varld? Gif ze say, to Martin Lauter, or Iohne
Caluin, ze condem zour selfis, becaus that
thay var bayth Apostatis fra the Catholik
kirk, and that kirk quhilk quhen Lauter began
vas inuisibil, remanis zit als inuisibil as
euer it vas, and nocht onlie as ze say hes bene
knauin to feu men, bot to na man at al. Gif ze
haue red the ancient vryttaris, ze micht haue
sene hou S. Augustine prouis aganis the Donatistis,
that it is impossibil that the kirk at
onie tyme be inuisibil, ze euin in the tyme of
the maist seueir and cruel persecutione of
the Antichrist, it sal remaine visibil, vtheruyse
it could thoil na persecutione. Bot ze vil mak
the deuil starkar nor god, and vil that the deuil
hes occupeit to him self al visibil kingdomes,
tounis, citeis, and that he hes left onlie
ane inuisibil kingdome vnto Christ.

               Quhy may nocht our Maister Christis Kirk be

               B.
               zour argumēt is verie vain, the kirk may be
inuisibil, thairfoir it is inuisibil, as gif ze vald
say, Smeton may be bischop of Sanctādrois
alsueil as Maister Patrik Constant, thairfoir he
is Bischop of Sanctandrois: I desyre zou to
proue that the kirk vas inuisibil indeid, and
nocht that it may be inuisibil: for ze knau, as
in the schuillis thay say comonlie, [a posse ad
esse non valet consequentia,] this is the first
fault in zour argument. Nou gif for disputationis

caus I vald grant, that in the tyme of
the particular synagoge of the Ieuis, the kirk
had bene inuisibil, zit Christis kirk may nocht
be at onie tyme inuisibil, fra the tyme he gaue
his Apostlis command,Act. 1. as ve reid in the actis
of the Apostlis, that thay beginnand at Hierusalem
sould preache in al Iudaea, Samaria, and
the far pairtis of the earthe: for lykas the coue
nāt of God maid vith mākynd eftir the flude

                  sua
albeit for the greit synnis of the preistis of
the sinagoge, God had sufferit his kirk aluterlie
to be destroyed in the sicht of men, zit
the promise of Christ Iesus saying,S. Matt. 28. (And behald
I am vith zou at al tyme vnto the end of

in the dayes of Elias.
            
            
               S.
               Becaus as ve reid in the bukis of the kingis,3. Of the kingis, 19. chap. Elias
sayis lord, thay haue slaine thy Prophetis, thay haue
brokin doun thy altaris, and I am left alane, quhais
lyf thay lay vait for.
            
            
               B.
               Lyk as ze propone the doubt of Elias, quha
being out of mennis societie, micht nocht vndirstand,
bot be reuelatione quha vorshippit
God treulie, and quha var idolatouris follouing
Baal: sua I gif zou for ane ansuer, that
quhilk god him self subioynis,3. Reg. 19. saying (I haue
left vnto my self seuin thousand mē, quhahes
nocht bouitthair kne to Baal) quhavald nocht
haue bene cōmendit be ane diuine oracle, gif
thay had bene negligent in goddis seruice.
Then I demand of zou quhidder gif seuin
thousand be ane sufficient number to represent
ane visibil kirk,Act. 1. seing the elleuin Apostlis,
electing Matthias in place of Iudas represented
the kirk visibil and Catholik? And gif
zour kirk vas inuisibil, as vas the synagoge in
the tyme of Elias, ze sould haue schauin seuin
thousand, quha had nocht bouit thair kneis
to Baal, or at the lest ane hundreth, or seuinscoir
or seuin, or at the lest, ze suld haue schauin
ane. For gif the Catholik religion be fals,
ze haue al bouit zour kneis to Baal, and God
hes reseruit na man to him self at al. Gif ze
had brocht out of the darknes and vildernes
sum men quha had professed that religione
quhilk ze profes, and quha neuer had onie

communicatione vith vs, than zour sayingis
vald haue appeired to haue sum probabilitie,
bot sen ze can do na sic thing, ze gif plane testimonie
of zour selfis, that zour inuisibil kirk
is na thing els bot ane Phātastical dream: And
gif onie man vald start vp euin nou in Scotland
and teache onie neu haeresie of his auin
brayn, gif he var demandit of zou of his
kirk, in the quhilk he hes learnit his doctrine,
he micht ansuere vith als gret probabilitie as
ze do, that his kirk hes euer bene, bot that it
hes bene inuisibil: quhat argument can ze be
abil to produce aganis him to proue that
thair hes nocht bene sik ane inuisibil kirk as
he allegis, quhilk ve can nocht be abil to produce
aganis zou? And gif it hes bene inuisibil
hou haue ze knauin it sua veil? And quhy
micht nocht vther men knau it alsueil as ze?
And quhy haue ze bene sua inuyous that ze
vald nocht schau it to the rest of the varld?
Nou to cum to Elias, ze can nocht deny bot
Elias him self vas visibil, quhen he maid the
complaint. And in Iudaea at that tyme,3. Reg. 22. thair
vas the maist godlie king Iosaphat, quha neglected
nocht goddis seruice, and Elias complaint
vas onlie aganis Samaria, as is manifest
in the text▪ quhairfoir zour argument prouis

               The kirk is callit Catholik for monie reasonis,
quhilk for the schortnes of tyme nou I
vil supersed, assignand to zou ane in special,
becaus it dois comprehend the hail varld, as
the hail varld vas promised to Christ for his
kingdome, and inheritance (Dabo tibi gentes
hereditatem tuam,Ps. 2. Lucae. 24. & possessionem, tuam terminos
terrae. Oportebat Christum pati, & resurgere
a mortuis,Ps. 71. & praedicari in nomineeius

of synnis to be praeched in his name

throch al nātionis: And his dominione salbe
extendit from the ane sea to the vther, and
from the flude (to vit Iordanis) to the vtter
borderis of the hail earth: And siclykvther places
infinit of the scripture quhairin the obedience
of the hail varld is promished to Christ
be his omnipotent father of heauin: sua that
the Apostlis, and thair successoris ar send to
subdeu the hail earth vnto the obedience of
Christis kirk, beginnand at Hierusalem vnto
the extreme pairtis of the varld, as he commandit
thame to do: Not that the hail varld
sould be al at ane tyme subdeuit to him: bot
becaus his impyre and kingdome being anes
established, it sal neuer decay, bot incresch, āddilat
it self continualie to the tyme that it haue
occupeit the hail varld as vas spokin lang
befoir be al the Prophetis, and as ve se fulfilled
alreddie and passand forduart fra day to
day, becaus the Apostlis as thay var commandit
be Christ, began to preache the Euangel
at Hierusalem, and thaireftir it did incress
and dilate it self throuch inumerabil pairtis
of the hail varld: And eftir the Apostlis had
endit thair course, and seallit the treuth of the
Euangel vith thair blude, thair successoris in
lyk maner did imploy thair labore for the farder
amplificatione of his kingdome: And eftir
thame the Pastores quha succedit in thair
places trauellit in lyk maner to inlarge his
kingdome, and hes contiuuet euin vnto our
dayes, in the quhilk ve se the kirk of Christ

largelie amplifeit in the greit cuntreyis of the
Indis, quhair his name vas not acknauleged
befoir: And euin sua it vil incresch to the tym
the hail varld be subdeuit to him, according
to his auinvord: This is ane cleir and manifest
declaratione of the vniuersalitie of the
kirk, and in quhat sens and mening the kirk
of Christ is callit Catholik, or vniuersal confirmed
be al ancient doctoris of the halie kirk

not that quhilk began at Hierusalem, and euer

The mater is sua cleir that I mister not onie

                  ther argumentis
to refel the vanitie of zour ansuer,Aug. lib. de vnit ate Eccles.
nor thai quhilk S. Aug. vsed to refel the Donatistis:
first the propheceis quhilkis var foirspokin
of the kirk that it sould be dilated
throuch the hail varld, vald haue bene in vain

gif thay had meanit of ane kirk quhilk could
not be manifeslie knauin to the Eeis of men:
Becaus ve could neuer haue assurāce of the fulfilling
of onie sik Prophecie,Daniel 2. As quhen Daniel
sayis that the God of heauin sal steir vp to him
self sik ane kingdom quhilk sal neuer be destroyit.
And that the kingdome of Christ
sal occupie the hail earth: quhat assurance can
ve haue of this except ve may persaue vith
our eis that Christ hes erectit sik ane kingdome
vnto him self? And zit ve can neuer persaue
the same gif ve say that his kingdome
comprehendis onlie ane certan number of
vnknauin men dispersit on the face of the
earth, as ze say: And hou can ze be abil to conuict
the Ieuis that this prophecie foirspokin
of the kingdome of Christ is fulfilled in zour
kirk? for gif ze say to thame that zour kirk
hes euer bene throuch the varld as vas foirspokin
of the kingdome of Christ: Thay vil
desyre zou to schau that, quhilk gif ze can
nocht do, as ze profes zour selfis ze can nocht:
Thay vil iustlie lauch at zour fulishnes: As
quhen Daniel foirspake of the impyre of the
Greikis, and the RomaneImpyre quhilk sould
be befoir the kingdome of Christ, gif the Roman
impyre had neuer bene mair knauin to
the Eeis of the varld, nor zour kirk hes bene,
quha vald euer haue said that the Prophecie
of the Roman impyre had bene fulfilled? or
gif onie man had said it, think ze not that he
vald haue bene iustlie scornit be the hail

varld? Hou than can ze eschaip bot ze expose
zour selfis to be maist iustlie mockit bayth be
the Ieuis and Gentiles? and that ze mak al the
propheceis of the kingdome of Christ to haue
bene in vain, gif he had nane vther bot ane
phantastical kingdome quhilk ze imagin to
zour selfis? This is not my argument, bot the
argument of S. August. aganis the Donatistis,
be the quhilk as thay var conuicted, sua ze,
and al haeretikis in the varld ar conuicted:
And to enter in farder consideratione of this
mater, sen ze esteme the Roman kirk to be
the seat of the Antichrist as ze blaspheme, suppō
vith zour selfis that thair had not bene sik
ane thing in the varld as the Romane kirk quhen
Martin Lauter begane, and imagine vith
zour self that giue ane Ieu had bene present,
ād requirit of Lauter to schau the Propheceis
of Christis kirk be the quhilk it vas foirspokī
that it suld occupie the hail varld:Ps. 2. & 71. & 102 That the
portis of the kirk sould be oppin bayth day
and nicht:Esai. 60 & 49. That the princes ād Monarcheis of
the earth suld be subdeuit vnto it:Daniel. 2. zea the Romā
impyre it self:Mal. 1. that his name sould be louit
and glorifeit in it to the end of the varld:Daniel. 2. That
it sould neuer be ouercummit be onie vthir
kingdome] to cōuene to that kirk quhilk he
vas to erect Ī Almanie: quhat vald he haue be
ne abil to haue ansuered? quhat testimonie
could he haue geuī that that kirk had cōtinued
euer sen Christ? that the kingis and Monarchis
of the earth hes bene subdeuit vnto it? Or

that the impyre of Rome at onie tyme hes
bene obedient vnto it? or that the portis of it
hes bene oppin bayth day and nicht to resaue
euerie man at al tyme? or that in it the name
of Christ hes euer bene glorifeit? Al men may
esilie persaue that he vald haue bene vnabil
to haue maid onie ansuere: As to vs quha ar
propirlie callit Catholikes, ve haue na difficultie
in the mater, becaus ve may sehau maist
cleirlie that al the Prophecies foirspokin of
the kingdome of Christ conuenis vnto vs,
and that ve ar his inhaeritance: ve schau hou
that the kingdome of Christ began at Hierusalem
according to Christis auin command:
hou that in ane schort space it vas imbraced
maist zelouslie in innumerabil pairtis of the
varld, and euer continualie knauin and spokin

as vryttis sanct Augustine aganis the Donatistis

ve mak it manifest vnto al men that
the kingdome of Christ pertenis vnto vs, sen
ve schau that the propheceis quhilk var foirspokin
of it, ar fulfillit in our kirk: As to zou
(as he said in lyk maner aganis the Donatistis)
sen ze can nocht schau that thir prophecies ar
fulfillit in zour synagogue, ze declair maist
cleirlie to the hail varld, that it is not the
kingdome, and inhaeritance of Christ: And
quhen the Donatistis ansuerit to him, that
thay had communicatione vith monie quha
var spred throche the hail varld, S. Augustine
desyrit thame to produce [literas communicatorias]
that is, thair letteris quhairbie thay
micht schau that thay aggreit vith sik vther
kirkis as thay said var spred throche the hail
varld, quhilk becaus thay could not do, thay
var conuicted to be haeretikis, and learis:
be the quhilk argumēt ze ar conuicted in lyk
maner, for gif ze vil sēd throch Spāzie, throch
Italie, throuch al Afrik, throuch al Asia,
throuch the hail Indis, throuch al Germanie,
throuch al Frāce, and the rest of the varld, excep
it be in sum lytil nuke, ze vil not get onie

thay fra quhom ze vil obtene sik letteris, ar
bot neu intrudit men, and Apostatis from the
Catholik religion, lyk vnto zour selfis. And
hes na schau of the face of ane kirk, sen as sayis
S. Cyprian (Ecclesia est plebs sacerdoti adunata,
& pastori suo grex adhaerēs,) the kirk cōsistis
of the peopil vnit vnto the preist, and ane

flok adhaerent to the auin pastore, bot amā

vald be prouī esilie not Catholik, be reassone
Martin Lauter, and Iohne Caluin quhen thay
began could not schau communication vith
onie kynd of kirk vpon the face of the earth.
As to vs ze se hou esie it is to schau that ve
haue communication vith that kirk quhilk is
spred throuche the hail varld: Gif ve vil send
to France, to Germanie, to Spanzie, to Italie,
to Pole, to the innumerabil cuntreyis of the
Indis bayth oriental, and occidental, ve vil
find that al the bischopis and Pastoris aggreis
in ane doctrine of religion vith vs, and quhasoeuer
hes bene acknaulegit for lauchful bischopis,
and Pastoris bayth in Asia, and Afrik
hes maid professione of that sam doctrine:
Zea in our dayes in the tyme of Adrianus the
s
                     •
                  xt, bischop of Rome, the Patriarche of Alexādria
did send to Rome, and mak professione
of ane fayth vith him. And the Patriarche
of Armenia com to Rome him self vith
ane Archebischop, and tua bischopis to acknaulege
the bischop of Rome, and to profes
vnitie of doctrine vith him: And in the
tyme of Iulius the thrid the gret Emperore of

Ethiopia send in lyk maner to Iulius the
thrid to haue communicatione vith the kirk
of Rome: and Pius the fourt did constitut ane
Patriarch thair, quha vithin thir feu zeiris
onlie is discessit: The greit Patriarche of Assyria
quha hes ane greit number of bischopis
vndir him did cum to Rome for the lyk caus:
And in the tyme of Pius the fourt Abdisu the
Patriarche of the kirkis quhilk ar bezond Euphrates
vnto Ind, did cum in lyk maner: And
to praetermit that in the general Concile of
Florence bayth the Greikis, and Armenianis
did al aggrie in the professione of ane fayth
vith the bischop of Rome: Nou presentlie the
greit Emperore of the Moscouitis intraittis
vith Gregorius the threttent, quha is nou leuand,
to haif communicatione vith him in
fayth and religione: And thairfoir ze se zour
selfis that amangis thame al quha professis
the name of Christ ve onlie ar callit Catholikis,
not onlie be our selfis, bot euin be zou
and al schismatikis: And quhen onie of zou
speikis of ane Catholik, he vndirstandis ane
of thame quha professis our doctrine: For
the quhilk caus sayis S. Augustine, that euin
the name [Catholik] did hald him in the kirk
becaus that kirk euin be the Haeretikis thame
selfis vsed euer to be callit the Catholik kirk,
and gif thay had sepokin vtheruyse, na man
vald haue vndirstandin thame: And the ancient
father Pacianus vrytand aganis the Nouatianis

sayis (Christianus mihi nomen est, Catholicus
cognomē:) that is my nāe is ane Christiane,
ād my surename is ane Catholik, be the
ane sayis he, I am discernit from the Ieuis, and
Paganis, be the vther frō the Haeretikis: Bot
as to zou ze haue na name quhairbie ze may
be discernit from haeretikis, sen ze ar content
ōlie to be callit faythful or Christianis, quhilk
al haeretikis dois vsurp vnto thame, sua ze vant

or Protestaōs: for ze cā nocht vithout extreme
impudencie cal zour selfis Catholikes: And
thairfoir al the tyme that euer I vas amang
zou nather red I, nor hard I of onie man,
the name Catholik: quhil I chanced to reid
ane Catholik vryttar Dominicus Soto, and
thairfoir in zour beleif, for Catholik ze say
commōlie vniuersal kirk, as the head of al the
Protestaons Martin Lauter, for the kirk Catholik

               Thou may nocht be hard to haue onie reassoning

to sklent and mak the act of Parliament
ane buclar for zour defence aganis al

Iohne kmnox, quha vas na pastore bot intrudit
him selff in the scheipfauld of Christ,
About the space of xxi zeiris bygane, schuke
louse all the actis of Paipis, and Emperoris, of
Praelattis and king is maid be continual success
of tyme, the space of ane thousād fyue hūdreth
and threscoir zeiris, and zit ze for ane act of
parliament, maid nocht be ane king bot ane
particular fauorar of zour sect vsurpand the
authoritie be zour moyen, vil stay disputation
of onie head of religione at this tyme. Quhairfoir
I vil fullie resolue zou of this doubt be
the grace of God: I demandit the Erll of Mortone
in Dalkeith, quha vas vpone the Cōcile,
at the making of the act: Quhat vas confirmit
thairby, concerning the religione? For
ather it behouit to be (said I) the treuth of the
Bybil, as it is vrittin in the text, or sum certan
expositione thairof, or generallie that, quhatsumeuer
the ministeris preachis, or var to
preache efteruart, sould be ratifeit, as Goddis
vord? gif it vas the treuth of the Bybil, as it is
contenit in the text, the act is superfluous, becaus
thay quha ar callit Papistis neuer denyit
the sam, Albeit the act vas maid to bring thame
to ane neu religion, quhilk thair foirfatheres
miskneu: Giff it vas onie expositione of
the sam, it aucht ather to haue bene vryttin
or prentit: Bot, thair is nather expositione

vryttin, nor prented, except sum friuol negatiues,
quhilk ar imbraced nocht onlie be the
Ministeris of Scotland, bot be the Ieuis and
Paganis, as that, Christis bodie is nocht vndir
the formes of breid and vyne, That thair is
noch seuin sacramentis &c. For the affirmatiuis
ioynit heirvith ar al thifteoulie stollin
from the Catholik kirk, Quhairfor said I, it
restis that al quhatsumeuer the Ministeris sal
speke in the pulpit is ratifeit be that Act of
parliament, quhilk is ane vngodlie thing: For
gif the general Conciles of the hail kirk hes
errit, as thay falslie alledge, quhy may nocht
onie particular man of thame, preache erroneus
doctrine for the treuth? Nor it is nocht
aneuche that ane minister, being iustlie reprouit
be onie of his brethrene, mak ansuer, and
say: Brother quhatsumeuir I teache in the pulpit,
is confermit treu be the act of parliamēt,
quhairbie ze aucht to dea, as ane transgressore
thairof, becaus ze say that to be fals, quhilk
the act of parliament confermes to be treu:
My lord Morton ansuerit, that Sanct Augustine
vas als vyse ane man, as onie of thame,
quha var on the Concile at the making of
that Act. Quhairfoir lyke as he vrait bukes of
retractation, sua quhen ve find onie act of
parliament sayis he, vranguslie maid aganis
God, and gude reassone, ve vil annul the sam,
and estableis the contrare: And thairfoir zour

of the vittiast of thame that vas the

quhairon onie man may leane his fayth considering

            OF THE CALLING OF KMNOX
and the fals ministeris of Scotland.
            CHAP. XXVIII.
            
               Sm.
               THou art verie blasphemous aganis that treu pastore
of God Iohne Kmnox, saying that he intrudit
him in the kirk of God vithout al calling.
            
            
               B.
               Gif he had onie calling, it vas ather extraordinar,
lyk as had the prophetis befoir
the cūming of Christ, or ellis ordinar, quhairbie
ane lauchfullie callit pastore, callis another
be the sacrament of Ordour, and onlaying of
handis: gif he alledge the first kynd, it is necessar
that he s
                     •
                  hau the vision of the Angel, vith
the circumstancis, and haue miracles, lest the
peopil be seducit, or ellis na man is obleist to
beleue him: gif he had onie ordinar vocation
I pray zou declair the same.
            
            
               S.
               He vas ordinarlie callit be the peopil.
            
            
               B.
               The peopil is to be commendit, qua geuis
obedient audience to ane pastore lauchfullie
promouit, bot quhair reid ze in the scripture,
that euer ane pastore vas callit be the multitude?
or quha gaue the multitude sic authoritie?

For I reid that S. Paul ād nocht the peopil
callit Titus and Timotheus,1. Tim. 4. quha ressauit authoritie
be the onlayng of his hādis:1. Tit. 1. and that
he left Titus in Creta, that in euerie toune he
sould apoynt Bischopis and preistis. And
Christ in the Euangel of S. Iohne,S. Ioh. 20. sayis, As the
leuing father hes send me, sua send I zou, that
is, as the father send mevith pouar and authoritie
to send vtheris, sua I send zou: that nocht
onlie ze may exerceise the office zour selfis,
bot also ordane vtheris thairto. This pouar is
geuin be Christ to the Apostlis onlie, and to
thair successoris, and in nauyse to the peopil,
lyk as euer hes bene practised vnto this day.
By that, the pouar quhilk is granted to the
Ministeris of the kirk, is nocht ane ciuil or
politik pouar, bot heauinlie and diuine, bot
the peopil hes na vther pouar bot ciuil or politik
as is maist manifest and cleir: Zea Caluine
zour Maister cōfessis that the peopil hes nocht
pouar to administrat the sacramēt of Ordour,Caluin li. 4. institut. cap. 3. sect. 16.
bot that it appertenis onlie to the pastoris of
the kirk, and the ressone of this is maist cleir,
becaus it is ane thing maist propirlie apertenand
to the gouernement of the kirk to appoynt
gude and lauchful pastoris: Bot the gouernemēt
of the kirk appertenis nocht to the
peopil, bot to the pastore, as ye gouernemēt of
the scheipfauld apertenis not to the scheip bot
to the pastore: Quhairfoir gif Iohne kmnox
be nocht callit, bot be the peopil, he hes ingyrit
him self in the scheipfauld aganis the ordinance

of God. And albeit I vald grant to
zou that the peopil had pouar to cal onie
man, quhilk is maist fals, zit Iohann kmnox
vald be destitute of al lauchful vocation,
quhilk that it may be maist manifestlie knauin
to the gentil men, quha ar heir present,
I vil demand of zou tua quaestionis:
               The ane is to schau me ane lauchful Magistrat,
or authoritie, that apoynted Iohann
kmnox for ane minister? For the peopil aganis
the vil of the supreme magistrate hes na pouar
nor authoritie to estableis onie thing, mekil
les, to estableis ane thing of sua greit importance:
to this quaestione ze can nocht ansuer,
Becaus the Quenis Maiestie of Scotlād, quha
vas than Quene of France, and our souerane
ladie hir mother, than regent of Scotland, did
bayth ganestand the vsurpit authoritie of
Iohānk mnox, and vald neuer approue that he
sould preach in the realme of Scotlād: And he
violentlie did oppose him self vnto thame
bayth: sua he is nocht callit be onie temporal
authoritie quhilk is lauchful, bot intrudit be
the peopil agains the lauis, and ordinances of
the lauchful magistrat: The secund is, quhat
religione professed thay, quha apoyntit Iohne
kmnox ane minister? Gif thay had bene of our
religiō, thay vald neuer haue apoyntit him: gif
thay var of that sam religion, quhilk he preached,
than it is necessar that sum vtheris sould
haue preched that religione vnto thame, or

he him self befoir he vas callit, ād sua he could
nocht be callit be the peopil, or at the lest the
first precharis of that doctrine could nocht be
callit be the peopil, quhilk is aueuch for my
purpose.
            
            
               Sm.
               Quhair thou sayis that Paul left Titus to appoynt
Bischopis and preistis, thou art ignorant of the
greik langage, quha turnis (Presbyter) to be ane preist,
for it is callit, ane eldar.
            
            
               B.
               Albeit the natiue significatione of Presbyter
be, that it is callit ane eldar, zit as ve reid ī
the Epistles of Ignatius discipil, to the Euangelist
S. Iohne, Presbyter and Sacerdos in the
primitiue kirk signifeit ane thing. Becaus grauitie
of maneris, quhilk is speciallie conioynit
vith aige, vas requirit in thame quha var consecrat
preistis. Siclyk, Erasmus quhom ze vil
grant nocht to haue bene ignorant of the
greik, translaittis,

                  , be Sacerdotiū.
Al the greik authoris, quha vndirstude verie
veil quhat 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   vas callit, callis 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   bayth ane thing: And S. Hierom
quha vndirstude in lyk maner the greik tung,
takis for ane thing Presbyter, and Sacerdos, as
Cyprian, Augustine, and the rest quha hes
vryttin in latine,Hierom cōt. lucife. Cypria. li. 1. epist. 9. August. de vnitate Ecclesiae. neuer makand mentione of
ane Minister. Gif ze sal seik the natiue significatione
of euerie vord, onie man may obiect
be als gud reassone to zou, that (Minister verbi
Dei) sould nocht be callit ane of zour pastoris,
bot ane gentil mannis seruand, quha reidis
the chapture of the Bybil at hame, becaus the

propir significatione of (Minister) is ane seruand.
And (verbum Dei) is callit the Byble. Bot
nou I pray zou schau me quhat pouar the
peopil hes to to chuse ane pastore?
            
            
               S.
               Ve reid in the Actis of the Apostlis that thay
commandit the multitud of thair disciples to espy
out seuin men of gud lyf ful of the halie Ghaist and
visdome quhom thay micht apoynt draconis to serue
the tabillis.Act. 6.
               
            
            
               B.
               Sua may ane Minister desyre the people to
search out ane gud and godlie schollar quha
may be presented vnto thame, and zit this
presentation makis him not ane Minister:Act. 6.
Ze may reid in the same Chapture ane lytil
eftir, That thir seuin men chosin be the multitude
resauit not authoritie of administratione
in the kirk, bot be the sacrament of Ordore,
and onlaying of the handis of the Apostlis
for it is thair vryttin, Thay brocht thame in
presence of the Apostlis, and eftir thay had
prayit, thay laid thair handis vpon thame.
            
            
               S.
               Gif thou require ane ordinar calling be onlaying
of handis, Iohann kmnox resauit it from zour Roman
kirk.
            
            
               B.
               Than ze man grant zour Maister Iohann
kmnox ane heretik, and Apostat quha
maid defectione thairfra, and thaireftir denyit
his vocation: Attour that, The pouar of
Ordore is not sufficiēt to ane man to preache
bot he man haue also iurisdictione ouer thame
to quhom he preachis, Iohann kmnox resauit
neuer sic iurisdictione fra the Roman

kirk to preache in the Realme of Scotland,
thairfoir suppoise he receauit from it the Ordore
of preisthead, zit he had na pouar to
preache nor to lauchfullie administrat the sacramentis,
finalie ze ar iniureous to Kmnox,
affirming that he hes enterit anothir vay nor
he confessit him self, for he preachit in the
toune of Edinburgh, that gif Esaias,, Hieremias
and vtheris var prophetis, he vas ane
prophet lykuyse, and mair nor ane Prophet,
sua that being demandit of the reuerend father
Maister Niniane Vingzet nou Abbot of
Ratinsburgh of his authoritie, he ansuerit
that he vas extraordinarlie callit euin as vas S.
Iohne the Baptist, And this he ansuerit in
publik befoir the people: Bot priuatlie he
scheu him self to be callit in ane vther maner,
that is be gunnis, and pistolis, for in ane conuention
haldin be him, Villox, and vtheris of
thair sect, as I vndirstude of ane nobil and honorabil
man quha can zit beir vitnes gif I lea
or not, Villox proposed as ane maist vechtie
mater to considder, be quhat vay thay sould
admit thair ministeris, for said he, gif ve admit
thame be the impositione of handis or onie
vther ceremonie vsit in ordinar calling, the
lyk vil be ask it of vs, that ye schau that ve
var admittit to the ministrie vith sik ane

kirk of Scotland befoir vs: Iohann kmnox
ansuerit maist resolutlie, buf, baf, man ve ar

               Thair is na dout bot extraordinarlie Iohān
kmnox vas raised vp to ruit out idolatrie out of

may be vndirstand except the Paip of Rome, sic is the
ambitione and corruptione of the maneris of the hail
toune of Rome that it is direct repugnant to the lyf of
treu Christianis. I knau zour Germane Papistis var

               Lyk as the Deuil callit Lucifer ane berar

for albeit that place of S. Iohne be in verie
deid vndirstand of the toune of Rome, zit it
seruis na thing to zour propose, becaus bayth
according to the plane vordis of the text,
and the interpretation of ancient vryttaris it

quha maist cruellie did persecute the kirk of
god, and in special the Paipis and hie preistis
of the same bischopis of Rome, the space of

Magnus, during the quhilk tyme al kynd of
Idolatrie did ring cheiflie in the toune of

for the quhilk caus S. Iohne sayis (That the

becaus that the hail varld vas contaminat

and of the covis in the quhilk is thay sumtyme
did lurk to escheu a lytil the furious rage
of persecutione and of thair maist halie reliques,
that almaist the hail toun of Rome is

            OF THE ANTICHRIST.
            CHAP. XXIX.
            
               Minister.
               VEar not sua ignorant bot ve knau perfytlie
that S. Iohne in his reuelatione speakis not

and of thingis to be completit lang thaireftir, and
lykuyse that monie thingis quhilk var spokin of
Rome var fulfillit in the cruel Emperoris: zit ve affirme
maist constantlie that S. Iohne speakis of ane
vther Antichrist quhilk vas to inuade the treu
kirk of God ane lang tyme eftir the crueltie of the
infidel Emperoris sould ceise, quhairbie gif ve considder
his propirteis aricht, nane vther may be vndirstand
except the Paip of Rome:
            
            
               B.
               I grant that by the Emperoris quha ar zit
cummit S. Iohne menis of ane vthir Antichrist
quhilk sal inuade the treu kirk, bot
qunair ze alledge that nane vther may be vndirstand
except the Paip of Rome, I desyre
zou to produce ane solid reasone to conferme
zour assertione, vtheruyse al men of gud

iudgement may persaue hou esie it is to me
to reiect the sam, as maist fals and vnuorthie
of onie farder improbation. Bot nou to the
end that al mē may vndirstād quha may iustlie
be callit the Antichrist, I vil propone sum of
his cheif markis quhilk ar setfurth in Goddis
vord, that thairbie ve may knau him and keip
our selfis that ve be not seducit be his vickit
doctrine: his propirteis contrare vnto thame 
quhilk we find in Christ man be,2. Thess. that he be
ane man hauand assistance of the deuil in al
operation:Esaiae. 11. lyk as the seuin giftis of the halie
Spirit restit vpone the manlie nature of Iesus,
sua sal the seuin deidlie synnis pryd, auarice, licherie,
glutonie, sleuth, Ire, and inuie regne in
him and his disciplis: Lyk as the ground of 
the Christian religione is the confessione of
S. Petir,Mat. 16. that the sone of the leuing God is cū
                  mit
in the fleshe, sua sal the principal but
quhairat he sal schut be to deny Christis cū
                  ming
in the fleshe,1. Ioh. 2. and the hail vorkis done 
be verteu of his incarnation: Lyk as in
Christ vas puritie of doctrine vithout onie
error and godlines of lyf,1. Pet. 2. Sua in the Antichrist
sal be ane denyal of al doctrine befoir
established, and ane Mass of al erroris befoir
cōdēnit maist impudētlie teached for treuth,
and contempt of al gud commandimentis
and godlie lyf,S. Mat. 19. zea ane prouocation to al impietie:
Lyk as be the Consil of Christ his disciples 
left thair vyfis, and thay quha var vnmareit
villinglie leuit chast al thair dayis, that

thay micht indeuor thame selfis haillelie to
the seruice of God, Euin sua the Antichristis
disciples be his consile sal think thame selfis
maist vnhappie gif thay haue not vyfis, not
uithstanding thair estait and aige sal be repugnant
to sik mariageis as thay sal desyre, For
Daniel testifeis that the hart of him and his
disciples sal be brunt vith the lust of vemen:Daniel. 11
Lyk as Christ began his preaching in the treu
 kirk of God, be planting the doctrine quhilk
vald haue bene the caus for the quhilk Hierusalem
sould haue standin for euermair, gif
the induellaris thairof had resauit it: Euin sua
the Antichrist sal sit in that kirk be making
the people Apostatis,2. Thess. 2. quhilk befoir acknauleging
the lauchful pastore vas the treu Hierusalem
or kirk of God, and nou be defectiō
is maid the seat of the Antichrist, quhair of vil
inseu gret desolatiō ād ane suddane ruine: Lyk
 as Christ ꝓmised that the zettis of hel mening
thairbie error and fals doctrine sould not preuale
aganis his kirk,Matt. 16. bot his halie spirit sould
gyde hir ī al treuth to the end of the varld, sua
sal the Antichrist teache the plane contrare,
to the ēd it may be collectit that Christ vas ane
deceauer makand ane fals promeiss, for he sal
preache that the hail kirk hes imbraced monie
headis, of erronious doctrine: Lyk as
 Christis kingdome had ane smal beginning
at that tyme quhen the varld in verie deid vas
in greitast blindnes,Act. 1. and thaireftir grouis quhil
it haue occupeit the hail varld, Euin sua the

Antichrist vil maist impudentlie affirme that
the hail varld vas in blindnes befoir his cumming,
and persuade his disciples that obstinatlie
thay thoil the dead for mentenance of his
erroris, quhilk obstinatnes paintit vith the
colore of patience vil seduce monie, and be
thocht falslie miraculous proceiding of the
Spirit of God, and mak thame quha vil be seducit,S. Paul
be ane blind and inordinat zeal becum
inraged to persecute the treu Christianis maist
extremlie,2. Thess. 2. quhil he haue dilated his poysone
vniuersalie, that is quhil he haue in al pairtis
quhair the kirk is, professed ennimeis to the
same, laboring for hir destruction: bot quhen
it is at the heicht it vil lest onlie thre zeir and
ane half,Apoc. 11. quhil as be the contrare to the gret
cōfort of the treu Catholikes, Christis kingdome
being anes at the heicht sal lest for euermair:Daniel. 7.
                   Lyk as Christ descendit of the tryb of
Iuda, and vas reueled quhen the Impyre of
Rome vas resauand incress and maist florishing:Gene. 49.
Euin sua the last Antichrist be operation
of the deuil sal be generat of the seid of Dan,
quhen the Impyre of Rome salbe sua imminished
that it sal skarslie haue the maiestie of
ane impyre,2. Thess. 2. quhilk be the preaching of the
Antichrist vil resaue gret hurt: for he and his
disciples vil be maist desyrous to eiect lauchful
kingis, Princes Dukis, Lordis and haue thame
selfis placed in thair roumes albeit be hypocrisie
thay vil labor to clok the same and
appeir to seik na les: first vndir pretence of libertie

bring and kingis and princes subiect to
the Impyre of Rome from obedience to the
same, to the effect that thaireftir euerie ane of
thame may be the mair esilie ouerthrauī: Lyk
as Christ vas praefigurat in the auld lau be tua
beastis commonlie, sua S. Iohne in his reuelation
bringis in tua beastis for compleitting of
the bodie of the Antichrist, calling ane of thame
ane blasphemous beist absolutlie, quhairbie

Iohne of the beast vith the seuin headdis and

the vitious Emperoris of Rome quha did persecut
the primitiue kirk, bot also of the last
Antichrist: for the headis signifeis diuerss Haeresiarchis
and Maisteris of fals doctrine. The
hornis signifeis the assistance of temporal
pouaris quhairbie thair impietie is defendit:
And thir as S. Iohne sayis,Apoc. 17 resauis pouar at ane
hour vith the beast: for lyk as thay quha ar
Ministeris deput to preache in the kingdome
of the Antichrist dispossessis lauchful preistis
and Bischopis: Euin sua temporal men infectit

thame selfis inferior in spirit and courage to

Magistratis mētenaris of the treu religiō,

And his kingdome vilbe at the heicht

quhairin is ane viue image of the kingdome

the beast vpon quhom the hure sittis, that
is be quhais doctrine the Authoritie of the

[Permittis mulierem Hiezabel quae se dicit

 As Christ honorit the father of heauin,

for he vil teache that notuithstanding the grace
of Christ it is impossibil to resist the suggestionis
of the Deuil, or that onie mā hes pouar

quhen Cornelius as ve reid in the Actis of the Apostlis

he settis him self furth for god, quhil as he

               B.
               Sence it is maist treu quhilk the poet sayis,

(qu

Martin Lauter ar the tua beistis, quhairof
mention is maid in the reuelatione of Sanct
Iohne to compose ane bodie of the Antichrist:Apoc. 13.
As to the obiectionis quhilk ze bring
aganis the Paip, thay ar verie friuol: And first
ze appeir to misknau quhairin consistis honor,
and the differencis thairof: For it dois
consist in humiliatione of the mynd according
to the knaulege of the praeminence of
him aboue vs, to quhom it is exhibit: Sua as
to the vtuart actione and cerimonie, it may be
ane quhilk is exhibit to God, and his creaturis
quhilk he hes apoyntit to haue praeeminē
                  ce
aboue vs: as ve fal done on kneis, ve discouer
our headis, ve bek befoir god, and onie

cerimonie hes bene vsit sa monie zeiris in
Rome for declaratione of the reuerence quhilk
al Christianis aucht to the Paip or heich
preist infafar as he is Christis vicar and legat
on earth: Ze may put zour mynd to rest albeit
the Italianis and auld Romanis learne not
the Cerimoneis of courtasie at zou, quha ar
ennimeis to al ciuilitie: And gif Christ honorit
his Apostlis and S Petir sua that he veschit
thair feit,S. Iohn. 13 quhy reproue ze thame quha kissis
the feit of him, quhom thayknau to be placed

be God in the Chyre of Petir? Zea the Gētiles
instructed be the lau of nature onlie, gaue sik
reuerence to thair heich preist, as is manifest
of Plutarch descryuād the maneris of the ancient
Romanis, quhilk is sufficient to cōdem
zour inciuilitie quha refusis to do the lyk
reuerence to the treu vicar ane lieutennent of
Christ vpone the face of the earth, as al obedient
Christianis hes done sen the dayis of S.
Petir vnto this present: For the quhilk caus
the Ethnik Emperoris as Diocletianus be aemulatione
of the rite and cerimonie quhilk
thay persaued amangis the Christianis in honoring
of thair heich preist, var mouit to promulgat
ane lau that al men aknauleging the
Emperoris authoritie, for declaration of the
obediēce and honor deu vnto him, sould kiss
his feit. As to the place of scripture quhilk ze
alledge, Dar ze reproue the godlie man Cornelius
that he did cast him self at S. Petiris feit?
Or gif ze dar not reproue him, as ze dar not,
quhy reproue ze vs becaus ve do the lyk to
the treu successoris of Petir? Sanct Petir ansuered
indeid that he vas ane man, and commandit
Cornelius to ryse vp, geuand vtheris ane
exemple of humilitie, and lattand Cornelius
also vndirstand that the disciplis of Christ as
concerning thair auin priuat personis, desyris

                   meuer honor be geuin vnto thame,
it redoūd vnto Christ: And zit Cornelius
did bot his deuitie, As quhen ane nobil man

sittis doune on his kneis befoir the kīg albeit
the king say that he is ane man lyk him, and
caus him ryse and speik to him, zit he dois bot
his deuitie in doing sik honor and reuerence
to the king. As to the secund pairt of zour obiectione
gif S. Paul gaue cōmand to the Christianis
to obey the lauis of infidel prīcis maid
for ciuil gouernement not onlie for feir,Rom. 13. bot
for conscience befoir God: Hou mekil mair
aucht ve as obedient sonis to obey the constitionis
of our spiritual fatheris and pastoris
maid for our veil, according to the command
of S. Paul, [Obedite praepositis vestris & subiacete
eis,Heb. 13. ipsi enim peruigilāt quasi rationem
reddituti pro animabus vestris:]. i. Obey zour
reularis and pastoris, and submit zour selfis
vnto thame, for thay vatch for zou, and ar to
gif compt for zour saulis? And S. Paul teachis
maist plālie that Christianis aucht not ōlie to
obey the lauis quhilk the pastoris settis furth
in the name of Christ as propirlie callit the
lau of God, bot thay constitutionis in lyk maner
quhilk thay propone for the profeit of
the commonweil, As quhen he vsis sik ane
forme of speiking (Praecipio ego non dominus)
it is not the Lord quha geuis this cōmād,1. Cor 7.
bot I gif this command. And gif men in hairt
and conscience ar not obleist to the obseruatione
of the Ecclesiastical lauis and constitutionis,
quhat is the caus that ze constrain the
People to obey the inuentionis of zour headles
assembleis, and compellis thame incaice

thay disobey, to stand bairfuttit in sekclayth
sa monie sondayis in tyme of zour preachingis?
The Anabaptistis quhais doctrine is na

to ruit out Idolatrie, and to plant the

in this maner, That the Prior of Sanct Androis
Erl of Murray sould mentene the neu

And the neu Elias, sould fortifie the neu

               B.
               I vil be the grace of God proue maist euidentlie
that al thingis ar nocht expreslie vryttin

Euangel: sua that zevil be constrainit to grant
that monie thīgis aucht to be beleuit, quhilk
ar nocht expreslie vryttin in the Canonik bukis
of the scripture:S. Paul. As Sanct Paul him self
teachis vryttād to the Thessalonianis,2. Thess. 2. Stād,
and keip al thingis quhilk ze haue learned
ather be vord or vryt: And in the actis of the
Apostlis, By al the disputationis of Sanct Paul,
and the rest of the Apostlis,Act. 16. quhilk ar nocht

quhen thay passed throuch al citeis teachand,
Thay gaif to thame quha var conuertit to the

and Preistis of the kirk, to be obseruit be

                   Ve man beleue that thir bukes of the neu,
and auld testament quhilk ar canonik, hes authentik

errore, dytit be the halie Ghaist speikand in
the Apostlis, and vther halie men the vryttaris
 thairof. That the tuelf Artiklis of the
beleif var dytit be the halie Ghaist spekand
 in the Apostlis.Matt. 26. Ve reid in the Euangel of S.
Martheu that Christ and his disciples, eftir his
latter suppar sang ane Hymn, quhilk being
proponit to vs, ve aucht to beleif, albeit it be
nocht vrytrin in the neu or auld testament.
 Ve aucht not onlie to beleue the express
vordis of the text, bot also the mening of the
spirit of god quha dytit the same: as for exēple,
quhatsumeuer Sanct Luk being requyrit, vald
haue spokin be instinction of the halie spirit,
for vndirstanding of thir vordis (This is my
bodie) aucht to be beleuit be ane Christian,
quha peraduēture vald haue vryttin ane tracteis
for the vndirstanding of thir vordis, and
the hid mystereis cōtenit in thame, mair prolixe
 nor his hail Euangel. In the last chapter
of the Euangel of S. Mattheu Christ geuis
command to his disciples, to teache al nationis
tha thingis quhilk he had commandit thame,
and zit ve find nocht al thir thīgis expreslie
 vryttin. It is mair nor manifest that nane
of the Apostlis, nor Euangelistis proposed to
comprehend al tha thingis, in thair vryttingis
quhilk sould be fermlie beleuit be Christianis,
bot as vryttis S. Augustine, and vther ancient

doctoris to mak ane buke contening
ane admonitione to thame, that befoir had
beleuit concerning the mysterie of the incarnation
of Christ, of his lyf, and deathe: Thairfoir
thair ar monie thingis concerning the
iustificatione of man. The number of the 
sacramentis, and thingis requesit to the administratione
of euerie ane of thame. The 
communione of sanctis, Ordoure and discipline 
of the kirk: the obseruatione of the 
Sōday and festual dayes, prefigurat be the Sabaoth
day, and vther halie dayes in the auld
lau, vith monie vther siclyk headis that can
nocht be schauin expreslie in Euangelistis,
and the Epistles: quhilk eftir var vryttin onlie
be certane occasionis, and nocht to comprehend
in thame al the mystereis of our fayth:S. Ioan. 16▪
                  
And thairfoir the halie Ghaist is promised to
assist Christis kirk vnto the end of the varld,Augu. I. cōt. Cresc. cap. 33.
for the quhilk caus S. Augustine vryttād aganis
Cresconius grāmaticus, sayis that the scripture
in ane certane maner geuis vs ane resolutione
of al quaestionis, becaus in tha thingis
quhilk it contenis nocht expreslie, it geuis vs

buke vryttin var perished, the kirk vald

amang the gentiles befoir the vrytting
of onie of the Euangelis, and Epistles:
 Quhair as ve beleue the halie Catholik
kirk, ve ar bund to beleue fermlie all tha thingis,
quhilk the halie Catholik kirk ressauis

                        •
                     e. 16. and expedient for insttuctione.
In the Euangel of S. Iohne, Christ sayis vnto
his discipillis: Mairatour I haue monie thingis
to tell zou, quhilk ze may nocht beir at
this tyme, bot quhen the spirit of treuth salcum,
he vil teache zou al veritie: Of the quhilk
testimonie it is manifest that monie thingis
nocht vryttin expreslie, ar referrit to the secreit
suggestione of the halie spirit quhen tyme
 sal require. Quha is sua far by ressone
as to affirme that al the preachingis, adhortationis,
admonitionis, disputationis, and formes
of prayeris of the Apostlis ar expreslie

[ze haue hard of the dispensatione of the

quhilk var nocht commandit in the auld, and
monie thingis forbiddin in it, quhilkis in the

Caluine and al zour faythful brethrene sould

be circumcidit as var the Ieuis according to
the lau of Moyses. This expositione thairfoir
being reiected as maist vane and repugnant
to goddis vord, The mening of this place of
scripture is, that nathing aucht to be eikit or
parit from thevord of god, quhairin al Catholiques
aggreis vith zou, and this is nauyse repugnant
to the traditionis: becaus the quaestione
is nocht betuix zou and thame quhidder
gif onie thing sould be eikit to thevord of
god or parit from it: bot quhidder gif tha
thingis onlie apertenis to goddis vord quhilk

to the purpose, zesould haue schauin sum plane
testimonie of the scripture, that thair is nathing
apertenād to goddis vord, bot that onlie
quhilk is vryttin, quhilk nather haue ze done,
nor can be abil to do: Zea the scripture teachis
vs the plaine contrare, Stand and keip the traditionis
quhilk ze haue ressaued ather be vord
or vryt,
                  S. Paul. 2. Thess. 2. be the quhilk vordis S. Paul lattis vs
to vndirstand that the Theslalonianis and al
vtheris quhasoeuer standis in the treu religiōe

albeit thay be nocht vryttin, and thay quha
reiectis the foirsaid traditionis standis nocht

can ze excuse zour self, bot ze haue fallin al
from the veritie sen ze vil obserue na traditione?
The secund place of Scripture in the reuelatione
of S. Iohne aucht to be vndirstand in
lyk maner that na thing aucht to be eikit or

parit from his Prophecie, and nocht that na
thing aucht to be beleued or ressaued for the
vord of God, bot that quhilk is in this prophecie,
vtheruyse ve vilbe constrainit to reiect
al the rest of the neu testament, sua al men
may esilie vndirstand hou far aganis the mening
of the spirit of God, ze vse sic places of
scripture in zour sermonis for to dissaue the
simpil peopil. Nou to cum to the thrid
place quhair Christ obiected to the Pharisae anis,
thay vorship me in vane teachand the traditionis
of men: ze peruert it in lyk maner, sen
it is maist manifest of text, that tha ar callit
the traditionis of men quhilk ar repugnant
to goddis vord, as quhair God commandit to
honore the parētis,Matt. 15. the Pharisaeanis did command
the plane contrare, to neglect thair parentis
and mak offeringis vnto God of tha
thingis quhairuith thay sould haue suppleed
thair parentis indigence, quhairin thay contrauenit
expreslie Goddis commandiment.
Bot the Ieuis had sum treu traditionis a mangis
thame vithout the quhilk thay could not
attene to the perfyte intelligence of the scripture,
in the quhilk is Moyses did instruct the
seuintie eldaris quhom he did apoynt to gouerne
the peopil quhairof ze may reid Hilarius
gif ze pleis vryttand vpone the secund
Psalme,Hilar. in Psal. 2. and vther ancient vryttaris bayth
befoir Christ and eftir him. And this traditione
vas na lytil caus that the seuintie
interpretoris quhilk vas send to Ptolome

the king of Egypt to translate the Bybil out
of the Hebreu in Greik, did sua perfytlie aggrie
in al poyntis, that albeit thay var separat
ane from another, zit as monie vryttis, thair
vas nocht samekil as ane vord in difference
amangis thame, quhairin thay had ane special
assistance of the halie spirit, being helpit be
the traditione quhilk from hand to hand thay
had ressaued from Moyses. And the cause of
sa monie sectis amang the Ieuis as var the Sadduceanis,
Pharisaeanis, Essianis, Hemerobaptistis,
and vtheris, vas, becaus thay interpreit
nocht the scripture according to the tradition
of the eldaris, bot according to thair auin
phanthasie.Matt. 23. Thairfoir Christ gaue command to
obey thame quha teached in the Chyre of
Moyses, vndirstanding be the Chyre of Moyses,

maist certane reul and traditiōe that vas geuin

euin as nou amangis the Christianis, thay quha
interpretis the scripturis according to the
traditione geuin be the Apostlis, and euer obseruit

and soleid doctrine, and thay that follouis
nocht the said traditione, bot thair auin phā
                  tasie
as ze do: thay teache erroneous and peruersed
doctrine, and hes neuer constancie nor
stabilitie in onie thing, bot fallis ordinarlie
out of ane condemnit and pernicious errore,
in ane vthir mair dangerous: And thairfoir

The ancient fatheris be this reul vsed euer to
conuict haeretikes, As did Irenaeus the Valentinianis,
Tertul. the Marcionitis, Sanct Basil
the Eunomianis, S. Hierom the Luciferianis,
and S. Augustine the Donatistis, becaus that
thay ressaued onlie the vordis of the scripture,
and vald nocht ressaue the interpretatione
of thame according to the traditione of the
kirk. The quhilk traditione S. Paul callis the
Reul of fayth,S. Paul. Philip. 3. saying lat vs nocht depairt from
the Reul of fayth, that ve may al say ane thing.
And to the Cor.1. Cor. 11. For ane final resolutione of
ane controuersie, he proponis as ane maist
certane and infallibil vay of decisione, the maner
and Custume of the kirk. And sua quhasoeuer
follouis this Reul, that is the traditione
of the kirk in the interpretatione of the scripture,
he can nocht in onie vyse vauer from
the richt intelligence, and mening thairof.
For the quhilk caus fayis Tertulliane that S.
Paul passed vp to Hierusalem to the rest of
the Apostlis, to the end that he micht aggrie
vith thame in this Reul of fayth: And the caus
that ze, and al thay quha professis neu doctrine
thir dayes, ar fallin in sa monie erroris, and
sua discrepant ane from another, is, becaus ze
haue nocht follouit this reul in the reiding of
the scripturis, and vndirstanding of thame,
bot zour auin phantasie, and inuentionis of
zour auin braine.

               BOt the mater vil appeir mair euident gif ve
sal enter in particular consideratione of the traditionis
of the Papistical kirk, for thairin superstitiouslie
ar obseruit ane greit number of halie dayis
aganis the command of God,Exod. 20. Remember that thou
keip halie the sabaoth day, Sax dayis sal thou labour,
sua that gif ve labour not on euerie day of the oulk,
except the sonday, ve brek this commandiment: And
S. Paul vryttis aganis the obseruatione of the halie
dayis maist planelie: [I feir leist I haue bestouit my
trauel on zou in vain,Gal. 4. for ze obserue dayis and zeiris,
And siclyk I micht proue vtheris zour traditionis
to be plane repugnant to Goddis vord and commandimentis,
as the Making and vorshipping of Imagis,
the Inuocation of Sanctis, the Honoring of deid mēnis
banes, the Ganging in pilgramagis and monie vtheris
quhairof ze sould be eschamit.
            
            
               B.
               The treu mening of the commād of God
quhilk ze thrau for establishing of zour haeresie,
is that thay sould not labour vpone the
sevint day: As to the sax vthir dayis it is permitted
to thame to labour gif thay pleise, bot
it is not commandit that thay labore, as ze
falslie allege aganis the plane vordis of the
scripture, cōsidering the Ieuis had monie festual

dayis by the Sabaoth,Leuit. 23. As the feistis of the
Pasouer,Deut. 16. of the First fruitis, of the Tabernaclis

zea sum feastis thay obseruit hail aucht dayis

Christis commandiment concerning the keiping
of the Sabaoth day: quhair of it is maist
euident, that ze vraist the scripture to ane sinistrous
mening: for gif the Ieuis keipit the feast
of the Pasouer vith ane gret solennitie in remembrance
of the temporal benefeit, quhilk
thay resaued, to vit deliuerance from the bodelie
seruice and bondage of Pharao, hou mekil
mair sould ve obserue Pasche day in memorie
of the deliuerance of mankynd from
hel, be the resurrectione of our saluiour Christ
Iesus? sen as testifeis Sanct Paul tha thingis
quhilk var proponit to the Ieuis in ane obscure
schaddou and figure onlie,1. Cor. 10. ar offerit to vs
in treuth and veritie,Heb. 10. [Lex continebatvmbrā
futurorum bonorum, non ipsā imaginē rerum:]
.i. The lau contenit the schaddouis of
tha gude thingis that var to be reuelit, and not
the propir image, and forme of the thingis

ze vsit in zour obiectione, lyk as al the headdis
of zour doctrine quhairin ze disagrie from
the Catholik kirk, calland it Papistical, ar auld
condemnit haereseis, sua in this poynt ze follou
the futstoppis of the Manichaeanis, for as
testifeis Sanct August.Aug. epist. 119. thay obiectit this place
of scripture aganis the Catholikes of that

aige, becaus thay keipit the halie dayes: to
quhom he ansuerit that Sanct Paul speakis
not of the halie dayis dedicat be the hail kirk
to Goddis seruice for memorie of his benefeittis,
bot of the superstition of the Gentiles,
quha beleuit that sum dayis of thair auin nature
var vnhappie for ane coniunctione of
noysum planetis or starres, and becaus this, or
that planet vas in sik ane hous of the heauin,
quhilk opinionis var maist vain and improfitabil.
The Manichaeanis obiectit lykuyse
that the Christianis eftir the custume of the
Gētiles obseruit [solstitia and Aequinoctia) becaus
the Christianis keipit halie the Natiuitie
of the lord, and Pasche day, of the quhilk the
ane befel in the solstitial of vynter, and the
vthir eftir the aequinoctial of the spring tyme:
To quhom Sanct Augustin ansuerit that
the Christianis obseruit not thir seasonis mouit
be the superstition of the Gentiles, bot be
the command of Christis halie kirk, quha
apoyntit thame halie for rememberance of
the exceiding gret benefeitis quhilk redoūdit
to the hail varld of Christis Natiuitie and Resurrectione.
For defence of this louabil custume
of the vniuersal kirk in keiping of the halie
dayis S. Ignatius quha vas S. Iohne the
Euangelistis discipil and ane halie martyr
vryttis to the Christian people,Ignat. epi. 4. ad Phil. that thay keip

ne spernite, quagragesimam seruate, continet

that is to say. Lichtlie not the halie dayis,
keip the halie tyme of Lentern, becaus it
contenis ane exemplar of the conuersation
of the lord: And S. Cyprian in monie of his
epistlis commandis that the dayis vpon the
quhilkis the Martyris disceissit be diligentlie

bot that he forbiddis the Ieuis, quha var verie

to be verie leuand Goddis, or to represent
God, as hauing the figure of onie thing ather

he forbad to mak onie image, askit, in quhat
liknes God had appeirit vnto thame? Declairing
his mening to be that thay sould mak
na image, for the representatione of God, as
gif God had the figure of onie thing, quhilk

               Bot God alluterlie forbiddis to haue onie images

               B
               Zour assertione is manifest fals: becaus gif

proposed this, That the God of the auld testament
vas repugnant to him self, forbiddand
Moyses to mak onie image, and eftir commandand
to mak the braisin serpent, and the
Cherubinis: He ansueris to thame that thay
vndirstand nocht the command, becaus thay

to mak onie image, quhilk vas that he
onlie sould be vorshippit as God, and that na

sould be geuin, for the quhilk ēd he cōmandit
neuer onie image to be maid, bot onlie for sū
certane signe, or representatione, as the braisin
serpent vas commandit to be maid: And he
addis thairto, that gif it vas lesum to the Ieuis
to mak the braisin serpent for the significatione
of Christ, hou mekil mair is it lesum to
mak the image of Christ?Petrus Martyr in c. 8. iudicū. Zea Petrus martyr
ane man of zour auin sect confessis, that it is
lesum to mak the images of Christ, the Virgine
Marie, and vther Sanctis for ane halie representatione
of thame: And amāgis the Lauterianis

knau in quhat honore is the image of the
Crucifix: And gif ze vil considder the ressone
quhairfore god forbad Moyses to mak
Imagis, it vas becaus thair could na image be
lyk vnto god: bot sen the secund persone of

diuinitie hes tane fleshe lyk vnto ouris, and is
becummit man, ve may mak ane image lyk
vnto his humane nature: And thairfoir the
caus for the quhilk God forbad Moyses to
mak onie image,Tertul. lib 2. cont. Marcio. hes nocht place aganis vs,
quhen ve mak the image of Christ, or of his
Sanctis, as lang afoir the learnit vrytar Tertullian
did teache. And I vald demād zou, gif
it be aganis the lau of nature, or nocht to mak
imagis? Gif ze say that it is aganis the lau of
nature, ze condem zour selfis, quha makis the
imagis of Caluine, Beza, and vther heretikis:
gif it be nocht aganis the lau of nature, it can
nocht be euil of the self, bot onlie insafar as it
is referrit to sum euil end: Bot the Catholiques
makis al imagis for ane gud and godlie
end, that is for remembrance of Christ, of his
bitter Death and Passion, and that thairbie ve
may vorship and honore him: Thairfoir suppois
it had bene forbiddin to the Ieuis to mak
onie images, it follouis nocht that it is forbiddin
to vs, becaus as concerning the commandis
of the auld lau, ve ar onlie obleist to
that, quhilk is of the lau of nature, be the
quhilk it is nocht forbiddin to mak onie

               This is ane commone place, q
                     •
                  hairfra ze
collect sophistical argumentis: from the abuse
of ane gude thing to destroy it alluterlie,
and the richt vse thairof: Be the sam argument
ze may collect that the sone, and the
mone sould haue bene tane out of the firmament,
becaus thay var vorshippit be the gentiles
as goddis: And ze may collect that
zour merchandis sould nocht pas to burdeouse
to bring hame vyne, becaus it makis
monie of zour headdis dissie: And monie
vther siclyk collectionis micht be maid als
gude as zouris, quhilk vald not be verie profitabill
to the commonweil: For this argument
from abuse seruis mair, to proue the
contrare conclusione, becaus it follouis veil:
Imagisvar abusit, thairfoir thay ar gude in the
self, for that quhilk is euil be abuse onlie, of
necessitie man be gude being veil vsed. As to
the similitude of the braisin serpent, it makis
nathing for the mentenance of zour errore,
becaus the richt vse of it seruit for ane tyme

onlie, to vit salang as the peopil remaning in
the vildernes, var stangit bethe fyrie serpentis:
Quhairfoir the richt vse thairof ceissing, efter
thay had entered in the land of Chanaā, It vas
iustlie destroyit, becaus the peopil offerit incens
to it, follouand the exempil of the Idolatrous
nationis: quhil as be the contrare, ze neuer
hard that onie Christiane offerit to ane
image: And gif onie sik abuse had bene cōmitted,
it aucht to haue bene tane auay be publik
authoritie eftir diligent inspectione and consideratione
of the mater, ād nocht be the peopil,
as ze haue done: I reid that ane thousand
zeir syne ane Serenus Bischop of Massilia be
sik ane zeal as ze haue, did brek doune
sum imagis:Gregor. lib. 9. epist. 9. Bot Gregorius the first, Bischop
of Rome reprouit him maist scharplie
that he had done by his deutie, and that
neuer onie bischop befoir him had interprysit
onie sik thing: Bot ze appeir to attribute
les to men nor ze do to doggis quha hes
na participation of reason, for ane dog can
discern betuix ane hair and the image of ane
hair: be reasson he vil rin to tak ane hair
gif he se hir, bot albeit he se payntit, the maist
viue image of ane hair that can be deuysit, he
vil not moue him out of his place: And zit
ze vil that men be sua daft, that thay can
nocht discern betuix ane man, and the image
of ane man.
            
            
               Prot.
               Bot quhil as the Papistis in thair kirkis in
tyme of prayeris behalding thair Idolis and images

fel doune on thair kneis, vithout al doubt thay var
Idolateris.
            
            
               B.
               Sence ane Idol is that propirlie, quhilk
being nathing, is representit to be sum thing:
or that quhilk representis the thing that is
nocht: ze can not cal the Images of the Crucifix,
of the Virgin Marie, of al the Apostlis
and Sanctis, Idolis, vnles ze beleue that thair
vas neuer sik ane thing as Christ crucifeit,
as the Virgin Marie, as the Apostlis, and
Sanctis: For it follouis necessarlie, The Image
of Christ crucifeit is ane Idol, thairfoir
Christ vas neuer crucifeit: This is the hid
vennum quhilk lurkis in the hairtis of the
blasphemous Protestaons quhen thay cal the
imagis that ar in the Christian kirkis, Idolis.
Bot to zour obiection: Thay var na mair Idolatoris
quhen entering in the kirk of God,
and be inspection of the Imagis being brocht
in memorie of onie benefeit resauit of God,
thay fel doun on kneis to gif thankis, and
craif grace in tyme cumming, nor ze reiding
zour prayeris vpon zour bukes vryttin,
hauand zour ene fixed vpon the Paper ar idolatoris:
Sua that thay ar maist ignorant and
destitut not onlie of supernatural grace, bot
of natural wit also quha grantisthe vse of the
bukis vryttin in the kirk of God▪ and refusis
the vse of imagis, quhilk thing the Deuil perfytlie
foirsau quhen he mouit his ministeris
to burn al the bukis and monumentis of the
Doctoris, lyk as be thame he destroyit the

imagis, to bring the miserabil people in obliuion
of the thingis signifeit thairbie: The Anabaptistis
ar les blindit in this poynt, nor the
rest of the Antichristian Protestaons, for thay
refuse the vord vryttin and vse thairof, lyk
as thay haue done the images, ād lukis for reuelationis
out of heauin: Becaus the vord
vryttin and images hes sik affinitie in thair
substance, vse, and end, that nane can be deuysed
mair: for gif I vald compair euerie thing
requeset to the ane, and to the vthir, this vil
appeir maist manifest. Becaus in the bukis
vryttin, the mater quhairof thay ar maid
cōmonlie is paper, ane artificial thing inuentit
be the brayn of man: In the imagis correspondent
to this, is ane quhyt val, biggit be ane
Craftis man: To vryt the bukis, is requirit ane
scrib or craftis man learned to vryt vith pen
and ink, quha be letteris (quhais formes var
also excogitat be the brayn of man) trauelis to
express the images and memorialis of thingis
done, as he hes treulie consauit thame in his
mynd, that be representation invryt thay may
eftiruart be callit to our memorie, as for exemple
he vryttis the hail historie of the passion
of Christ: To ane scrib vith pen and ink, is
correspōdent ane paynter vith his pinset and
coloris, quha drauis the images of tha sam
thingis vpon ane quhyt val correspondent to
the paper, for the sam vse, and end: Nou gif
ze quha ar learnet at the schuillis be nocht
ane Idolater becaus ze behald the Paper as

requesit to bring zou in memorie of Christis
Passion, and al the circumstancis thairof: Quhy
sould the ignorāt pleuch mā, quha als perfytlie
be help of the payntrie descryuis the
hail Passion of Christ, as ze descriue the sam
be zour buk vryttin, be comptit ane Idolater
becaus he fallis doune on his kneis to rander
thākis to God quha hes inspyrit his hairt vith
remembrance of tha thingis quhilk ar representit
be the paintrie? For he vorshippis na
mair that thing quhilk he behaldis nor ze do
the buke: Gif the Images hes bene abusit, sua
vas, and is, the buk vryttin abusit mair miserabillie,
and vith gretar loss of ignorant saulis:
Becaus al haeretikis thrauis the sentencis of the
buke for establishīg of thair erroneoꝰ doctrine,
to thair auin perdition: Quhairfoir as the
vse of Imagis seruis mekil for aedification and
instruction of the vnlearned people, sua thay
labore to bring the people to Atheisme, quha
refusis to haue thame in thair kirkis and priuat
housis: For gif Theodor Beze vas mouit to
compassion be inspection of the imagis of his
Apostat brethrene,Beza in lib. 
                        •
                      conū. as he restifeis of him self:
think ze it not als reasonabil, that be inspection
of the image of Christ being iust and Innocent
put to maist schameful death for our
synnis, ve be mouit to beuail our auin faultis
and rander him thankis for sua gret ane benefeit?
Quhat man is sua mad that vil think
that is vas lesum to Theodore Beze to paynt
the Imagis of fals, trait
                     •
                  orous, and deceatful

haeretikis, and vnlesum to treu Catholikes to
haue the images of Christ representit as he
vas ane bairne in the armes of his glorious
Mother the virgine Marie: And lykuyse of
Christ Crucifeit, as be his passion on the croce
he triumphit ouer the Deuil and al his Apostat
Angellis, he abolished death and reconciliat
the varld to his father of heauin? Thair is
na man in his richt vit quha behalding onie
image trampit vndir fut, vil not esilie collect
that the persone representit thairbie is contemnit:
Bot albeit Beze desyris rather to behald
the images of Audebert quhom he bougrit,
and Candida vith quhom he committit
Adulterie, nor of the virgin Marie the mother
of the leuing God, quha redemit the varld, and
of Christ Iesus hir sone quha deed to mak satisfaction
for our synnis, zit I think gude to
propone to zou thair images, that ze may cō

               BOt ze ar not content to haue the images of the
virgine Marie and the sanctis, vnles ze cal vpon
thame for support, quhil as the inuocatiō of Sanctis is
vnlesum:Rom. 10. becaus it is vryttin, thay can not cal vpon

               B.
               This zour argument, be abusing the halie
scripture, is collectit out of ane vther sophistical
place callit in the schuillis [Homony
mia] to detene ignorāt people in blindnes: for
inuocation is tane tua maner of vayis, first for
the incalling of the author of grace, quha may
according to his omnipotent pouar, mak help
of na thīg: of the quhilk S. Paul speakis in this
place be zou allegit, and this is propir to God
onlie: Vtheruyse it is tane for requesting of
thame quha ar membris of ane kirk vith vs, to
mak vs support be praying vith vs to God,
that ve may obtene our petitione in the name
of Christ Iesus onlie mediator betuix God
and man: quhilk inuocation is commandit
vs, insafar as euerie membir of Christis kirk
sould request ane another for mutual prayer,
gif it be possibil.
            
            
               M.
               Ve may require mē leuād vpō the face of the earth
to pray for vs, becaus thay ar membris of ane kirk
vithvs, botve aucht not to require thame quha ar deid
            
            
               B.
               Sanct Hierom tuelf hundreth zeiris sensyne
ansuerit to zour argument,Hieron cō
                     tra vigilantum. That gif the
Martyris ād halie men quhē thay var vpō the
face of the earth, and subiect to the infirmitie

of thair bodeis and syn, as vther men, micht
impetrat sua monie thingis from God, hou
mekil mair being in heauin delyuerit from al
syn, and crounit vith gloir and immortalitie
may thay obtene quhatsumeuer thay ask?
And gif Sanct Paul being in this varld did
pray sua feruentlie for al tha people quhilk
he conuertit to the fayth of Christ, is it liklie
that quhen he is in heauin, he vil cloise his
mouth, and forzet thame al aluterlie?
               Quhairfoir it is plane infidelitie to doubt that
the halie Sanctis may heir our petitionis, sen
thay haue the fruitione of God, and acknauledgis
al thingis quhilk thay desyre to knau

touardis vs,1. Cor. 13. as S. Paul testifeis, that sam self
Cheritie man moue thame bayth to desyre to
acknauledge our estait, and in lyk maner to

vs, nor the Riche glutone,Luc. 16. quha vas condemnit
to hel, had of his brethrene: And thair Cheritie
vald auail vs na thing at al, quhilk is ane
blasphemie: Quhair ze say that the Sāctis apertenis
nocht to the bodie of Christ, it is ane
manifest blasphemie, for Christ hes nocht tua
bodeis, bot ane: sua necessarlie the sanctis of
heauin apertenis to his bodie, quhilk is his
kirk:Aug. de ciuitate Dei, & cōtra Faustum. as amangis vtheris S. Augustine in his

Manichaeus schauis maist manifestlie: Sua being

that thay being the maist cheif and principal

quhilk euer hes bene professed in the

               Albeit God be onlie searchar of the secreittis

And gift ze, quha ar miserabil men on the

               Minister.
               THe people vas gretumlie abusit be the honoring
of zour reliques, insafar as vithout onie cōmēdation
of Goddis express vryttin vord, Pilgramagis to
the kirkis and grauis of zour Martyris var inioynit
to the ruid and ignorant people, as gif God var nocht
alyk potent in al place, and his pouar of virking miraclis

var limitat to tha pairtis onlie quhair zour
Sanctis var bureit.
            
            
               B.
               Insafar as na man can be abusit be doing
of that onlie quhilk apertenis to his deuitie,
the people vas nauyse misusit be the reuerence
quhilk thay buir to the reliques of the
Sāctis, as the maist precious veschellis of Goddis
maist halie Spirit, to quhais honor al reuerence
exhibit befoir the reliques of the
Martyris, did redound: And it var lang to reherse
al the testimoneis of scripture quhairbie
Pilgramagis ar gretumlie commendit, lyk as
the mysterie thairof is verie great, declairing
hou syn is the caus quhy ve pas from God,
and that it behouis vs to sustene trauel and
pane,Matth. 3. gif ve sal returne to Goddis fauore agane.
For the thrie kingis ar gretumlie commē
                  dit
in the scripture, quha come out of the far
pairtis of the East, to vissie our saluiour Christ
Iesus at his natiuitie vith offerandis: In lyk
maner the Quene of Saba, quha viseit Hierusalem
to heir the visdome of Salomon.S. Luc. 4.
Siclyk our halie saluiour Christ commendis
the Pilgrammage of Naaman the Syrian, to
Elisaeus the prophete, be quhom he vas hailed
of his leprosie, Albeit monie in Hierusalem
quha var neirar hand, deed in thair seiknes:
And al the Ieuis vsit to mak ane solemne Pilgramage
to the toune of Hierusalem,4. Regū 5. as is cleir
in Goddis vord. Ve misknau nocht that
God is ouer al, and that his infinit pouar is
nocht limitat to onie certane place, bot may

vorke equallie in al places, zit it hes pleised
his infinit visdome, and sapiēce to schau mair
singular vorkis in ane place, nor ane vthir:
as ane special grace vas promised to thame
quha sould pray in the kirk of Hierusalem,Regum. 3. cap. 8.
quhilk Salomon in hallouing of the same did
craif of god befoir: And Daniel being in
the captiuitie, quhen he prayed to God, he
turnit his face touart the kirk of Hierusalem:Macha. 3. cap. 3.
And Heliodorus quhē he vas strickin doun af
his horse be the Angel of God, vas compellit
to grant to Antiochus his Maister, that thair
vas sum special verteu and puissance of god,
quhilk did remaine in that kirk. Lykuyse
quhen the Ieuis prayit befoir the ark of the
testament, and the propiciatoure, God did
declair to thame mair miraculous vorkis, nor
he vsit to do in vther places. S. Augustine
vryttand to the clergie, and peopil of Hippona,
schauis hou that God be his infinit visdome,Angust. in Ser. ad Popul. Hippo.
dois vork sum thingis in certane places,
quhair the Relictes of Martyres, and vther
halie men be, that he vorkis nocht in
vthir places: The quhilk thing, he sayis, pertenis
onlie to ane mysterie of his inscrutabil
visdome, sua that ve can nocht comprehend
the reassone heirof: For the quhilk caus, he
schauis vnto thame, hou that he had send tua
of his auin house, quha var diffamed of ane
verie horribil cryme, in Pilgramage to Nola
in Iralie, quhair the bodie of S. Felix vas
keipit: To the effect that God micht declair

his iudgement in that place, quhidder gif
thay var innocent of the said cryme or nocht:
He addis thairto, that being in Millen him
self, ane man vas brocht befoir the reliques
of the Martyris, to sueir gif he had commited
ane certane thift, or nocht, quha vas constrainit
euin aganis his vil to confes his thift:
And eftiruart concludis in this maner, that
euin as al giftis ar nocht geuin to euerie Sanct
in this varld, bot sum hes the spirit of healthe,
sum the spirit of prophecie, and sum, vthir
giftis, sua eftir thair deathe, God dois certane
vorkis be sum, quhilk he dois nocht be
vtheris, quhairof ze may reid in the said Author
at mair lenth.Aug. 22. de ciuit dei cap. 8. And in the tuentie tua
buke of the citie of God in the aucht chapteur
he vryttis, hou that ane zoung man, and
zoung voman Callit Paulus and Palladia quha
had fallin in ane paralysie, and trimbling of
al thair membris, be reassone of thair motheris
malisone, come in pilgramage to his toune
of Hippona quhair he vas bischope for the
tyme, And in sicht of the hail peopil,
be intercessione of S. Steuin,Sidonius lib. 1. Epi. 6. var hailed.
Sidonius Apollinarius vryttis to S. Hierome
hou that he had cōpleit his pilgramage to
Sanct Petir and Paul,Hierom. ad Marcellam. and that thairbie he had
obtened his health. And S. Hierom him
self vryttis to Marcella, that it var almaist impossibil
to him to compt al the learned and
halie men, and vemen, quha sen the ascensione
of Christ, hes cummit in pilgramage to

Hierusalem: He testifeis mairouer, that euin
from our Ile of Britānie, thay quha var maist
halie and deuoit, could nocht be content
vith thame selfis, quhil thay had bene in
Hierusalem, and adorit Christ in that place
in the quhilk he vas crucifeit for the saluatione
of man:Chrisost. Homi. 32. in Epist. ad Romanos. S. Chrysost. in his 32. homilie
on the Epistle to the Romanis, schauis quhat
deuotione he had to pas to Rome to se the
halie chainis quhair vith S. Petir and Paul var
bund, and to humil him self befoir the bodeis
of the halie Martyris.Eusebius lib. 6. Eusebius in the sext
buk and elleuint chapteure reherses the lyk
of the ancient vryttar Origenes, quha desyrit
to pas in Pilgramage to Rome. Basilius in
his homilie of the fourtie Martyris,Basil. Homi de 40. Marty. exhortis
al men to pas vnto thame, that hes mister of
quhatsumeuer thing: God sayis he, vil refuse
na thing to the Martyres, quha hes sched thair
blude for him: Theodoretus in the lyf of Simeon
geuis the caus,Theodo. in vita Siniconis. that mouis halie men
to pas in Pilgramage, quhilk is ane treu and
ardēt loue: For thay sayis he, quha loues onie

Thair is na thing hard out of thair pulpittis,
bot blasphemie aganis God in lauchfullie promouit
Pastoris, and Princes, to bring the Pepil
in suspitione, that the neu testament of
our saluiour, is the inuentione of the Paip,
lyk as thay blasphemouslie speke of his Sacrifice,
and Canonis of the Apostlis. Gif onie
man feiring God, considering thair beginning
and conferring the samyn vith haereseis condemnit
in our foirfatheris dayes, offer thame
disputatione: Thay trauel be al menis to seik

of his mercie grant the Peopil of the hail

It follouis consequenlie that nather

I thocht gude to subione as maist
pertinent to the sam effect and purpose.

            1 ANe change is maid from ane religione
quhilk ze had, Vnto monie diuerse
and contrarius sectis, and formes of maist damnahil
haeresie: from ancient: Vnto neu: from vniuersal,
and commone, to priuat, and singular: from that
quhilk had the vniuersal consent of zour selfis
at hame, togidder vith al Christian nationnis
of Europe. Vnto that, or thame, in the quhilk
nather zour selfis ar aggreit, nor onie monarchie Christian
agreis vith zou.
            
            2 Ane change from ane religione gouer

policracie of sa monie headis as thair be vsurpit

and popular headdis, as thocht thair var als monie
Goddis, as thair be absolute Princes, and as gif it

            3 Ane change from that quhilk vas planted

Vnto this quhilk is fosterit, be vsurparis of princes

Prioris, Archidiaconis, monkis, preistis, personis,
vicares, freris, and religious Nonis, to becum periurit
Apostatis, and foirsakaris of that Christiane and
godlie fayth, quhairunto thay gaue thair ayth befoir
God, and his halie kirk.
            5 Ane change from praying for saulis according
to the vord of God, and custume of the
halie kirk sen the dayes of our saluiour, To condemning
the lyf and cōuersatione of our praedicessoris
vnto hel, be the verie instinctione of Sathan: From
geuing of almous, To dissoluing of hospitallis: Frō
               creiping
in conuentis, To bragging in courtis:
From vouing of Chastitie, To mareing of Monkis:
From consecrating virginis, To vedding of
Nunnis, From promising pouartie, To professed
vsurie: From volontar obedience, To obstinat
arrogance: From fasting on fishe dayes, To gormanding

fleshe on frydayes, and the halie tyme of lentearne:
From vatching and praying, To sleiping
in the kirk: From kirk mēnis praying, To layict
mēnis preaching: From sermonis by doctoris, To
vemēnis lecturis: Frō ressoning, To railling: From
reuerence speche, to fulishe lauching at al halie
thingis: From remembring on Sanctis, To burning
thair imagis: From going in Pilgramage,
To hanting of harlattis: From penance of Pardonis,
To dissimulat fayth, and presumptione: Frō veping
for vickitnes, To lauching at syne: From
scrupil of euil doing in smal thingis, To gloir of
mischeuous dealling in materis of gretast vecht and
importance.
            
            
               6 Ane change from that religione quhilk
condemnit al erroris, Vnto this quhilk mentenis
al hereseis, sua that na heresie is thair of auld condemnit,
quhilk is nocht nou amang zou reneuit, and professed
maist impudentlie.
            
               7 A change from that religione quhilk acceptit
and imbraced Christ, his Apostlis, and
thair ordinar successoris head of the general
kirk, To this quhilk hes imbraced ane inuisibil kirk
vithout knauledge of Christis authoritie in onie
lauchful superior vpone the face of the earth: Albeit
it tuik the fundamēt from the kirk of Ingland, quhais
first frute of religione vas to place, in the Chyre
of Petir and feminine head, as gif onie vomā be peruersion
of the ordore and lau of nature, micht haue supremacie
and iurisdistione ouer the kirk of our saluiore,
As head, paip, heich preist or Apostle, as Prophet,
or Patriarche, as Archebischop, or Bischop, as Abbot, or

prior, as person or Vicar, as preist, clerk, or spiritual
magistrat and pastore quhatsumeuer.
            8 Ane religione of negatiues, a religione of leis, a religione
of periureis, a religione of fleshlie and licētious
libertie, a religione that leidis to lousnes, and al dissolute
lyf, a religione that of scripture, denyis sindrie
hail volummes, that of text it self, corruptis places infinit,
and vntreulie translaittis the rest, that sould
decyd onie questione or controuersie.
            9. Ane religione that leuis zou na scripture at al,
quhen sa monie bukes ar denyit, sua monie places corruptit,
and changit, sua monie textis falslie translated,
and sua monie haeretical glossis, and expositionis

            10 Ane religione that Falsifeis the fatheris, sklanderis
the doctoris, beleis the paipis, beleis the Emperoris,
beleis the praecteis of the kirk, and al historeis,
that testifeis the treuth of thingis past.
            11 Ane religione that callis Christ in the sacrament
ane idol, that callis the onlie sacrifice of the Christian
kirk, idolatrie: that professis it to be sin to beleue that
the Euangel is treu, saying. This is my bodie, my fleshe
is verie meat, or that fasting, praying, almous, vouis,
or vther gud vorkis dois pleise, or appese his vrayth,
albeit thay proceid from special grace, throuche Christ
Iesus our saluiour: That teachis Christiane fayth to
be fals doctrine, and thair auin fals, arrogant, and abhominabil
haeresie to be the treu fayth of Christ, albeit
it be repugnant thairto in al poyntis.
            12 A religione that teachis the cheif outuard sacrifice,
and honore to God, that euer vas vsit quhair
Christis name vas ꝓfessed, to be idolatrie: that teachis

sacrilege, incest, and the vilful slauchter of sacred, and
anoyntit personis, to be verteuous deiddis, acceptabil
to God, and that teachis the auld, cōmone, and knauin
vay of saluatione, to be the hie vay to damnatione
I cal it thairfoir be inuicibil consequentis a religione
that turnis darknes into licht, that teachis hel to be
heuin, and God him self to be the deuil of hel.
            13 Ane change from ane religione, quhairin
fayth, hoip, cheritie, fidelitie, abūdance of gude
vorkis, gud discipline, ordour, famous, and
vorthie renoune in al proceidingis did abūde,
To this, quhairin exces of vengeāce, laik of fayth, vehement
mischeif, mistrust in nicbthourheid, infidelitie
of kinred, and acquentance, insatiabil auarice in
steid of prudent liberalitie dois regne.
            
            
               14 Ane change from reuerence bering to

cruel Passione, michtie Resurrectione, and glorious
Ascensione, fasting, praying, abstening

touart thame, To ane blind and misordorit forme of
religione, that makis abhominatione thaîrof, and confoūdis
thir feystis vith vther dayes apoyntit to mechanict
laboris: quhairbie it may be esilie collectit, that
thay, and thair sect ar the maist affectionat disciplis
of the Cheif Antichrist, becaus thay haue laborit be
al meinis to put the blessed monumentis of Christis
benefeittis out of the memorie of thair miserabil auditoris.
            
               15 Ane change from ane veil ordorit religione,

that beiris thair Croces, and bringis furth vther smal
conspiratoris aganis the kirk of God, or ellis to deluge,
and leue the grounde voyd, and red to thame selfis:
And breiflie sik confusione that na strāger, except he

also, that he may be estemit ane gude follou, and na
thing different fra the commone sort.
            
               Ane chāge from that, quhais peopil aluays
paenitent, and reddie auaittand vpone the
calling of God, had participatione of the sacrament
of Christis bodie and blude befoir
thair departure out of this lyf, at the hour
of death: To this quhilk hes prescryuit, and limitat
certane tymes to the mocking of Christ, and abusing
his peopil, vndir the pretext of administratione of the
said sacrament, falsifeing that scripture, as al vtheris,
quhilk Christ our saluiour expreslie hes left vs, for
ane sufficient and maist plaine testimonie of his latter
vil.
