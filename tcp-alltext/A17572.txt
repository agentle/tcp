            TO THE READER.
            I Have found nothing (good Reader) in Mr. Michelsons confutation worthie of any answere, but that which is borrowed from D. Morton or D. Denison, and hath been already answered in Perth assemblie. What is his owne, is new, but so absurd, that just lie he hath deserved the change of his surname frō Michelsone to Nihilsone. The judicious Reader may finde as much in Perth assemblie untouched, as may serve for defence of that which he hath lightly touched: and may find further in the Solution of D. Resolutus his resolutions for kneeling. I have now added this defence of our reasons, not so much for reply to his confutation (for that was needlesse) as for illustration, and confirmation of that which hath been alreadie written in the two former, and to obviat such cavillations, as perhaps may be used by some other of our opposites. I will keep the same ordour, which our Antagonist hath set down̄e: howbeit he hath divided our arguments, to make them seeme the weaker, as Medea rent, and scattered the members of her brother, that ther by she might the more safely flee: which fault Peter Martyr objected to Gardinerus.

            DEFENCE OF OUR I. ARGVMENT.
            THE gesture of our Lord, and his Apostles, at the Paschall Supper, was a kind of sitting gesture. The same gesture was continued at the Eucharisticall Supper. For whilst they did eat, to wit, of the second service of the Paschall Supper (and consequently whilst they did sit) Christ took bread, and gave thanks, Math. 26. 26. Mark. 14 22. This collection is so cleere, and evident, that the Papists themselves, hote persecuters for kneeling, doe acknowledge the same. Cardinall Baronius; Annal. tom. 1. an, 34. num. 44. Vnde quod dicit Matthaeus, coenantibus autem eis accepit Jesus panem, & benedixit, & quod Marcus a
                     •
                  , & manducantibus illis accepit Iesus panem, & benedicens fregit: idem est ac si dixisset, recumbēubus illis. 
               That Matthew sayth, And as they were eating Jesus took bread, and blessed; and Mark saith, And as they did eat Iesus took bread, and blessed, and brak it, it is all one, as if they had sayd, whilst they were sitting. But Matthew and Mark, sayth our new made Doctor, must be interpreted by Luke and Paul, who do say, that Christ did institute the Sacrament after they had supped, Luk. 22. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 24. I answer, that Paul and Luke speak of the cup, and not of the bread, Likewise after Supper, he 
                     •
                  ook the cup, and blessed. Likewise, that is, hee give thankes, as he had done before, when hee took the bread. Neither Paul, nor any of the Evangelists do say, that after hee had supped, hee took the bread, as they doe of the cup. This difference of speech made Bellarmine De Eucharist lib. 4. cap. 27. to follow their opinion, who thought, that Christ consecrated, and

distributed, the bread, in the very time of the Legall Supper, whilst they were eating of it, and that after other actions interveening, and the Supper ended Christ took the cup. There is no necessitie to collect such a disjunction of so heavenly a mysterie; but the common opinion is to be retained, that this Mysterie was instituted per modum 
                     〈◊〉
                   signi, in one continued action. Alwayes wee may see, that the bread being consecrated, and distributed, and eaten, before Christ took the cup, justly it may be said, that after supper he took the cup, seeing now the first halfe of this holy action was ended, and had intervened between their eating of the Paschall Supper, and the taking of the cup. Put the case that Luke and Paul had said that after Supper he took bread, their words must so interpre
                  •
                Matthew and Mark, as that there be no contradiction. Christ took bread whiles they were eating, and yet notwithstanding after they had supped, because they were now closing vp their eating, and Christ entred in another act on. Barra

                  t the whole Sacrament was instituted after supper, yet it was instituted in the end of the supper, while as they were yet sitting, and eating: for they eat other meat, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the time of the institution of the heavenly food▪ and therfore Matthew and Mark say, that the Sacrament was instituted, while as they were eating: for they were yet eating, when the Lord took bread, blessed, and brake. Thus much for the

first collection of the sitting gesture of Christ and his Apostles at the Eucharisticall Supper, upon which all interpreters ancient and moderne haue builded. Suppose the first collection should faile, this second collection following will proue it. It behooved them either to sit, stand, or kneele. Stand they could not, for the beds joyned to the table would not suffer that gesture. They did not kneele; for if Christ had changed the ordinarie gesture of sitting at the Paschall supper, into kneeling at the Eucharisticall, a gesture of adoration, and no table gesture, then kneeling had been instituted and not left indifferent, and arbitrarie: For to what end should Christ have changed the one in the other, except it had been his will to have it observed, as other changes made in passing from the last act of the Paschall supper to the Eucharisticall. But our opposites dare not say, that kneeling was instituted. If therfore they neither kneeled nor stood, it followeth that they 
                  •
               ate. Never man was so impudent as to call this in doubt, till within these two or three yeares by past, that two or three hirelings have done it.
            In the Apostles times the gesture of sitting was continued in the Kukes: for the lovefeasts and the Lords Supper were so neere conjoyned in time, how be it different in mysterie, that Casaubone Exercit. 16. p. 511. Paulus

the Corinthians not onely conjoyned, but also confounded them; and so doth Baronius the Cardinall vnderstand him, when he saith; Augustine ad Januarium epist. 118. affirmeth, that the Corinthians used to take the Eucharist at supper, mixing sacred things with common, which the Apostle corrected. And afterward 
                  Num. 136. scriptū a Philone convivium sacris videtur admixtū quale illud Pauli ad Corinthios.
                he sayth, that the feasting described by Philo seemeth to have been mixed with sacrea purposes, like that of which Paul writeth in his epistle to the Corinthians. Now at that frugall feasting wherof Philo maketh mention, they sate on the ground upon mattes made of flagges, and their feasting was intermixed with hymnes and praises. Howsoever the Corinthians abused this holy action otherwayes, yet this intermixing declareth the usuall conjunction of the two parts, or actions. They being then in the Apostles time so neerely conjoyned in time, and distinguished onely in mysterie, it behooved them to sit at the one part, as they sate at the other: and so doth Bishop Bilson affirme Obedience pag. 461.. The practise of many Kirks after the Apostles times, even till Augustines daies argueth, that they sate in the Apostles times. Bullinger, De origine error▪ circa coenam cap. 4.

               the Deacon, and these most sweete conferences of Christ, which he being to depart had with his disciples are rehearsed. In the mean time the tables being set in order, the banketters sit down to them breaking unleavened bread, and reaching the cup to other, and so everie way representing the trace of the ancient Supper. This footstep of the ancient custome yet remaining amongst the monasteries of S. Bennets order, and observed upon Maundy Thursday, Morneus also observeth. See the Solution of D. resol. resolutions. p. 12. 27.
            Our first Argument then against kneeling in the act of receiving the sacramentall elements is drawn from the example of Christ and his Apostles at the first institution; and the practise of the primitiue Kirks following in the Apostles times. Their gesture was not a gesture of adoration in the act of receiving, but a Table gesture▪ for it was a sit
                  •
               ing gesture they used, and not kneeling. Christ instituted Baptisme, but wee reade not that he baptised in his own person. But in this Sacrament hee was not onely institutor, as Lord, but also celebrated as a Minister, and set down a most exact and perfect paterne of celebration. The practise of the Apostles following the same order is a direction to us to follow the same also.
            We reason likewise from this example and practise, against any other gesture which is not a Table-gesture, howbeit not with the same force, as against kneeling. There is eating with walking (as Pios the Monk did, who said hee would not make a worke

of eating his meate) but this is no tablegesture. To stand in the act of receiving, and then passe by, as in some Churches they do, is not a table-gesture. For there is no more use of a Table in this case, when the communicant standeth, & taketh out of the ministers hand, more then of a cupboord, or dressor, suppose it were never so long. For so it serveth onely to the setting on of the elements, that from thence they may bee reached by the hand of the Minister to the Communicant. A table of as short dimensions, may serve to that use, at the Papists require of necessitie for their Altar to hold up the foot of the Chalice, and so much of the plate, as may keep it from falling, together with the Masse-book, and the candle.
            We reason thirdly from the same example and practise, but with least vehemencie, against other table-gestures also, as standing about the table; because it is not agreeable to the first paterne and practise. It was not coena stataria, aut ambulatoria, but accubitoria, which Christ and his Apostles celebrated: not a standing or walking, but a sitting supper. But to returne to kneeling, I conclude with the words of Calvin, who sayth, That
               
                  (i) Instit. lib. 4. cap. 17. S. 35. 
               they are sure that they swarve not from Gods commandement, who take the sacramement as God hath commanded without adoration. They have the example of the Apostles, who prostrate not themselves but took sitting. They have the practise of the Apostolicall Kirks, &c. And of Beza against Harchius, Contra Harchium.

                   to deliver to the Kirks the manner of celebrating these mysteries.
            
            It is objected first▪ that if this argument be go
                  •
               d then the minister should teach sitting, because Christ taught sitting. But the case is no alike. For the Lords supper is a rituall action, and a visible object is presented before the communicant. Christ taught us by his example, how to behave our selves in such a case. Next, Christ taught sometime standing, sometime sitting, according to the opportunity of time and place. He sate in the mount, Mat. 5. he stood in the plain, Luk. 6. Paul stood up and made his exhortation in the synagogue, Act. 13. He that prophesied stood up, 1. Cor. 14. 30. as Cajetanus doeth collect. Audientes sedere, prophetantes stare significat dicendo, Quod si alij sedenti. The originall word signifieth, that the other prophet who was not in the act of prophesying, was sitting, not sitting by. Lastly, this objection may be retorted upon themselves, That seeing Christ and his Apostles and all teachers and hearers in all ages afterward, did not preach or heare preaching kneeling, we can have no warrant to do it. If not at delivery or receiving of the word, then also not at the delivery or receiving

of the sacramentall elements.
            It is objected next, that Christ and his Apostles sate not at the paschall supper alter our manner of sitting, and that it was rather a lying then a sitting, as the originall words anakeisthai and anapiptem do import? It hath been answered already P. A. pag. 38. 
                     •
                  ol. pag. 
                     •
                  . 6. that it was not totally lying, but partly sitting, partly lying, and translated sitting, not lying, by the English translators. Yea the holy Ghost doth expresse this same gesture also by the word sitting in the originall language, Ezech. 23. 41. That kind of gesture, (whether brought in among the Iewes by the Romans or Persians, or if it was as ancient as the dayes of David or Salomon, as some do collect out of 1. Sam. 9. 22. Prov. 7. 14. 16. Cant. 1. 12. it is not materiall) succeeded in the roome of upright sitting, and hath given place again to the same, as answering analogically to it. It was in Christs time the received manner of sitting, and no further is required of us but to observe the received gesture of the countrey, where we are. It is also to be observed that anakeisthai and anapiptein are not the proper vocables to expresse this kind of gesture, as Athenaeus doth testifie. Lib. 1. cap. 18. Beza in Math. 8. 11. sayth, that anaclinesthai is put there for cataclinesthai the proper greek vocable of this gesture. Farther, howbeit in a private parlor a small number did sit after that manner at the first paschall supper, yet it is no way probable, that in the Christian assemblies afterward in Corinth, Ierusalem, or else where, they sate after the same manner. For howsoever

there is mention made in ancient writers of houses of 60. 80. or 100. beds, that was not common, but peculiar to princes and great men. Plutarch Symposia 5. noteth it as a vice in a man to build houses for 30. supping beds, or above. Shall we then think, that the Apostolicall Kirks had the use of such houses for their meetings, or that the Lords supper could be celebrated in such a form in their numerous assemblies.
            It is thirdly obiected, that if we be bound to the imitation of Christ, and his Apostles gesture by as good reason we shall be bound to the imitation of the time and place; that is, to celebrate after supper, and in a private house. It is answered that the circumstances of time and place of the first supper were onely occasionall, and the occasion of them was vnavoydable because of the law of the passe over. But the gesture might be easily changed by Christ without violation of Gods law, namely seeing the paschall supper was ended. It was a easie to them to goe to their knees, as to the Aegyptian Naucratits after they were set downe to their feasts, when they began to sing hymnes to their gods. But our Lord would keep the same forme at the Eucharisticall supper, which hee kept at the paschall. Our Doctor sayth, that the Apostles retained these circumstances, and changed them not. I answer, if that were true, we have no reason, nor warrant to doe otherwise. Next, if the Apostles retained these circumstances upon occasion, and not for imitation, upon necessitie, & not

voluntarily, then he hath gained nothing. For we deny not, that in times of persecution, or when occasionally there falleth out any necessity, we may celebrate in the night, and in a private house, where the Church is assembled. The Apostles would not have been suffered to celebrate the supper in the temple, as sometime they were overseen to teach. Next, it was not so fit for the celebration of the Lords supper, as for the preaching of the word. The first was ordeined onely for the beleevers: the last, to convert also unbeleeving Iewes. Thirdly, there is no likelihood that they celebrated ever at night. For howbeit at Troas Act. 20. it were granted to have been celebrated at midnight; as some do call it in question, yet who seeth not, that it was then d
                  •
               layed to that time, not because it was the usuall time, or for imitation of the institution but onely upon occasion. The Apostle being to depart, did continue preaching, and so that action was continued. The Centurie vvriters doe not affirme, that the Corin

            Defence of our second Argument.
            TO the due ministration of the Lords Supper there is required a table, whereabout the communicants are to be placed. If a table, then also a table gesture; kneeling is not a table-gesture. Therefore kneeling is not a fit gesture for this Supper. A table is so requisite to this action, that from a table this supper hath received one of the scripture names, that is, to bee called the Lords table, to distinguish it from common tables. As it is called breaking of bread, because that rite was usuall in the celebration of this sacrament. By this reason, sayth the Doctor, it should be celebrated at evening, because it is called the Lords Supper. It is true, that in our language, this word, Supper, signifieth onely the evening meale, but not so in the originall. For the word Deipnon in ancient Greeke writers signifieth indefinitly the repast that a man taketh any time of the day, yea suppose it were before the rising of the sunne, as may be seen in Ho

The word which was ever used to signifie that which we call Supper, is dorpos, or dorpon. Casaubonus giveth also this reason of the name, That it is called a Supper, rather then a dinner, because of old they dined sparingly and supped more liberally, to signifie the plenty and liberality of this feast. Other allegoricall reasons of this name I omit. To returne then, not onely was this feast called the table of the Lord, but also it had a table indeed, not onely in the Apostles time, but also many ages afterward, both for consecration and distribution.

far more at this sacred feast, which is a banquet of Loue. Musculus therefore is not to be commended for his saucie censure of the laudable custome of the reformed Churches, where are, and hath been so many worthies: I will forbeare comparisons. Luthers testimonie set down by Musculus in that same place is memorable. Therefore Christ so instituted the Sacrament that in it we should sit at Table. But all things are changed, and the idle ordinances of men are come in the place of Divine Ordinances. Musculus himselfe on Matth. 26. 23. observeth in the ancient Proverb Mensam & salem non transgred
                     •
                  , that the Table was counted sacred, and a symbole of friendship. And deploreth the corruptions of our times, wherein neither the fellowship at the prophane, nor mysticall Table, maketh us mindfull of this dutie. And in his Common Places De coena Domini pag. 345. Sacrificio competit ara, communication

                   sacrificu compet it mensa. he saith, that to a sacrifice belongeth an Altar, to the communication of the sacrifice a Table. A feasting Table then being granted, the gesture of Kneeling, being no Table-gesture, must be excluded in the act of banquetting, which is the proper use of the Table. The Christians under the ten persecutions, it is true, could not haue the commoditie of high tables, and seates a swerable. But it is neither the height, nor the matter that we stand upon. Whether the table be round, square, or extended in length: whether it be of timber, or stone; of a bull hide, or a plot of ground: whether it be high or low; the forme and

Communicants may communicate tablewise: Whether they convene in dens, or deserts; in Kirks, or houses. Wine is one of the Sacramentall elements, and yet Volaterranus writeth that the Priests of Norway were permitted to consecrate in other liquor then wine, because wine could not be kept in that Northern Country. So a plot of ground whereabout men sit and feast, answereth analogically to the high

Wee are now speaking of Assemblies, and Congregations, whether in time of peace, or under persecutions. See further of this second Argument in the answer to D. Resolutus. pag. 16.

               After the Lord had taken the bread, and blessed it, hec divided it insufficient number of peeces, and ordered them a the Plate, and reached them to his Disciples, saying the words of consecration, which being finished, every one received his own part, and communicated. What is further alledged by the Doctor against this third Argument, shall be answered in defence of the fourth reason, as in a place more convenient.
            The Doctor casteth by, in a dark corner, two of our reasons, as not worthy to be answered, or ranked in order, & number with the rest. First we say, that where kneeling is in use, the Sacramentall breaking after that ksgiving is not enioyned, so far as we can find in their Service books, when as other rites invented by man are injoyned. And for practise, Paraeus testifieth that the Lutheran Kirkis have it not, but have the bread cut in small pecces before it be brought to the hands of the Minister, which is not that

Sacramentall breaking instituted by Christ. The Doctor 
                  •
               aith that he and some other of his followes doe break the bread. But I would demand, if that be the common order of the Kirks where kneeling is in use. Next if it be a breaking in the own time, and place, that is betwixt the thankesgiving, and giving with these words, This is my body, as Christ gave it. For the Papists have a kind of breaking after all the words are finished. For belike it is heresie to breake it before they have said; Hoc est enim corpus meum.
            
            The second reason disdainfully rejected by the Doctor, is this, that kneeling hath brought in a change upon the sacramentall word, changing the enunciative forme of the words, T

                  is is my body into a prayer uttered in the act of delivery of the el ments to the communicant, The body of our Lord Jesus, which was given for thee, prese

               e ministration it selfe, as Christ ministred that action. I wish it were well observed, that in the English service-booke the words of the institution are rehearsed in forme of a prayer to God, in a contnuall tenor with the prayer begun in other words before, just according to the order observed in the Canon of the Masse. And so the words are reh
                  •
               arsed not to the communicants as Christ uttered them to the Apostles, but prayerwise to God, as the Priest doth when

he offereth the sacrifice of the Masse, which is a great absurdity, and abuse of holy Scripture. There the words of promise are uttered in an enunciative forme, but to God; as if there could be no consecration before the rest of the celebration, except these words be pronounced with the prayer. I dare be bold to affirme, that the sacrifice of the Masse had never entred into the Kirk, if this double action, one of consecrating with rehearsal of the words of the institution all at once, without the rites correspondent to the words; another of distributing with other words, had not first entred. The first turned into sacrificing, the second onely remained to be called the sacramental service, or communion.
         
         
            Defence of our fourth Argument.
            THE communicants ought to distribute the elements to others, according to Christs precept, Divide it amongst you. This distribution cannot consist with kneeling. He alledgeth Fenner against this distribution, but impertinently: for he speaketh nothing against it. Beza is so farre from den

                  e, to that same cup which he commanded them to divide amongst themselves. But

that protestation is applied to the communion cup by Matthew and Mark, Math. 26. 28. 29. Mark. 14. 24. 25. It was therfore the communion cup which Christ commanded to divide. He alledgeth against this reason, Piscator in Math. 26. 29. saying, that it is no absurditie to think that Christ made that protestation twice, once of the paschall cup, and again of the communion cup. But writing afterwards upon Luke, he sayth, as being better advised,

               that there is inversion of order to be observed in Luke, in so farr, as that part of the action, which concerneth the wine, is set downe vers. 17. and 18. before the action concerning the bread. For that these words are to be understood of the cup of the Lords supper, it is cleare sayth he, out of Mark. 14. 24. 25. who subjoyneth immediatly to the words pronounced of the cup of the Lords Supper, these words, I will drinke no more, &c. No Evangelist maketh mention twice of this protestation of not drinking more; how then can men so boldly conjecture, that it was spoken twice, once of the Paschal cup, and againe of the Eucharistical' Matthew and Mark make this protestation to be spoken but once, and that of the communion cup. Againe, if Christ had made this protestation concerning the paschall cup, how did he keep his promise, if he did drink after the paschall cup, of the Eucharisticall cup? Hee sayth Musculus doubteth, if it may be assirmed, that Christ himselfe did eat, and drink, of the sacramentall bread, and wine. But he doubteth without reason. Doth not Matthew and Mark say, that Christ protested

               
                  •
               nene the communion cup, that hee would drink no more of the fruit of the wine after that. It followeth then that he drank of it.

Hes sayth next, that Christ kept his promise, albeit he drank of the cup of the new Testament, after that hee drank of the paschall cup, but letteth us not see, how that should be. He protested, that that passover should be the last, he should eat with them in this mortall life, and this hee performed. He sayth he protested the like of the paschall cup, Luk. 22. and yet drank after that of the communion cup, but that is the very thing we deny: and we have already made manifest, that there was but once protestation made anent the cup, and that it was the communion cup. Further, this protestation was made anent the last cup; but so it is, that the cōmunion cup was the last cup. Beza in Mark. 14. 25. Alludit ad morem, q. o nefas erat post poculum illud apolyticon quicquam cibi in posterum diem capere.

Seeing therefore this is acknowledged, not onely by Calvin, Beza, Piscator, Bellarmine, Swarez, Walterius, and many moe both Popish and Protestant Writers, that, divide it amongst you, concerneth the communion cup, we may not heare without any gaine-saying, that it is indifferent, whether the Ministers or the Communicants, distribute it. For if Christ commanded the cup to be distributed by the Communicants, who hath authoritie to make it indifferent? But when it is made indifferent to open a doore to superstitious and idolatrous rites to enter in, then is Christ Precept most of all to be observed, If the cup should be divided by the Commumunicants, then is it like that the bread

should be divided also, seeing Christ said of the br

            Defence of our fifth Argument.
            KNeeling, say we, maketh many communions in one Congregation, in the place of one, without any necessity: wheras if wee keeped the right order, wee needed not to doe so. This addition without any necessity, he leaveth out, and impugneth the rest. We set to that addition without any necessity, because some Congregations are so populous, that they cannot communicate together in one day. Neither doe I thinke that any reasonable man will allow Congregations to be so populous, that they cannot communicate together in one day. That P
                  •
               rishes should be of so large extent, and Congregations so populous, is rather to be reformed as an abuse, then to be allowed. So the addition of that clause, without necessitie, is onely made in respect of the corruption of the times, not of that order which should be. Our Argument is grounded upon the Apostles precept, 1. Cor. 11. 33. Where
                  
                     〈…〉
                   brethren when ye come together to eat, ta

                     〈…〉
                   another. He sayth, that this text is alledged impertinently, because the Apostle by these words would redresse a certaine abuse which was in the Church of Corinth at their love-feasts, willing the rich to 
                  •
               ary for the poore. This is just the answer of the Rhemists upon this place. Hee exhorteth them say they, to keep their sayd suppers or feasts in unity, peace, and sobriety, the rich expecting the poore,
               
               &c. I content me with Fulk his answer. The words that follow (if any be an hungred, let him eat at home) doe declare manifestly, that this expectation, or tarying one for another, is to receive the communion of the Lords supper, and not to the eating of their love-suppers, which were ch
                     •
                  efly to relieve the poore, that were hungry. And bringeth the testimonies of Photius, Chrysostome, Theophilact, Primasius, Ambrose, and Hierome, to this purpose. Ambrose upon this text sayth, He sayth that they must tarry one for another, that the oblation of many may bee celebrated together, and that all may be served, and if any bee impatient, hee may bee fed with earthly bread at home. That you come not together to iudgement, that is, that you keep not the mystery so, as you bee worthy to be reprehended with offence, Hierome or some other under his name, upon this same place sayth, Because none taried for other, that the offring might be made in common, therefore they came together, not unto sanctification, but unto iudgement. Bilson Obedience, p. 461. citeth Augustine to the same purpose: yea Augustine affirmeth, that the Apostle speaking of this sacrament, sayth, For which cause brethren, when you assemble together to eat, expect one another. And againe, Obedience p. 494. he citeth these words of Chrysostome, Homil. in dictum Pauli oportet hereses esse. 
               Paul calleth 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Lords Supper, which is received in common, with one consent of all assembled together: for untill all communicate and bee partaker
                     •
                   of that spirituall food, the mysteries once set forth, are not taken away, but the Priests standing still, stay for all, yea for the poorest of all. The particle therefore knitting he 33. verse to the verses preceeding, maketh it manifest that this

precept is to be referred to the Sacrament. See more of this point in Perth Assembly P. A: pag. 44.. He saith that we may communicate Sacramentally in divers Parishes, which I thinke no other man ever affirmed. For howbeit they communicate together spiritually, as all Christians doe in the remotest parts of the world, receiving the same spirituall food signified in this Sacrament. Yet they doe not communicate together sacramentally, but who receive the Sacrament together. Cartwright, writing against the Rhemists, speaketh well to this purpose In 1. Cor. 11. 24. 
               The Apostle, 1. Cor. 10. 17. meaneth the communion of those that in one Congregation, or Church, eat together, and not of the communion of those that receive the Sacrament in another Church, it is evident, for that hee placeth the seale of this communion in eating all of one bread, and at one table: wheras they that communicate in another Congregation, or Church, communicate not of one table or bread with them that are farre removed, no more then they, that celebrated the Passeover in divers houses, were partakers of one Lamb or Kid. For notwithstanding that Christ (who is the Lamb and the Bread) be but one, yet the outward matter of the Sacrament cannot be one but many, according to the number of places, wherein the Sacrament is ministred. See more in this place, and in 1. Cor. 10. 17. See also Fulk in these places. And whether onely the twelue Apostles did communicate at the first Supper, see Cartwright and Fulk on Matth. 26. 20. This sacramentall communion of one Congregation was expressed yet more lively, where they dranke of one cup,

and eat of one bread. The Doctor himself
                  •
                alledged before Pag. 19. a saying of Musculus, wherein he approved their forme, who used but one cup to signifie the Mysterie of one and the same bloud, wherof all the faithfull do drink alike, yet not condemning the custome of those Churches, which use moe cups in the Lords Supper, because of the multitude of the Communicants. Neither do I think on the other side, that others will condemne those who use but one cup. But to place a greater necessitie in one cup, then in one bread, cannot be commended. They had of old, in some Churches, one bread, as well as one cup, one in number, of one masse, unum unitate numerica sive physus per partium continuationem, and not one in morall conjunction of many peeces, as many dishes are called but one banket. And this one masse or loafe was unbroken, or cut in peeces till the Minister had first blessed; and for this use they had a knife called Sacra

any longer, but as friends; and this advancement he hath expressed in the Symbolicall Supper, representing our spirituall advancement at the spirituall Supper. Hee who inviteth us, it is true, is not a simple man, like an earthly Prince, but God and Man; but that setteth forth the greatnesse of our dignity. The food whereon we feed is not earthly, it is true, but that ministreth matter of greater joy to us. But the manifestation of his will and pleasure, is not to be obstued in the outward resemblance of the feast, seeing it hath pleased his Majestie to set forth his neerenesse and communion with us by the formes of feasting. In the old Law, the Lord sate between the Cherubines, and eat of the sacrifice (to speak after the manner of men) at his Table, to wit, the Altar, which is so called, Malach.

            Defence of our seventh Argument.
            THE seventh is almost coincident with the former. So it pleaseth him to divide and rank our reasons. Kneeling is not a fit gesture for a guest invited to a banket; It obseureth the fellowship, whereunto he is advanced. He perverteth our reason very perversly, against his own conscience, as if wee smelled of Arrianisme; and meant that wee are equals with Christ. A simple reader may smell in this stinking flower of his, grosse popery, and in some

poynts grosser then in a common Papist. Doth every one invited to a Princes table, think himselfe equall with his prince. Hee gathereth as perversly, as if we thought, h

And when we ascrive any signification to our sitting, we say not, that it signifieth our sitting in heaven, but a present rest, and ease of the soule admitted familiarly to the spirituall table, where Christ dineth and suppeth with it.

            Defence of our eighth Argument.
            KNeeling before the sacramentall elements is Idolatry. The Papist in his kneeling intendeth to adore Christ bodily present by transubstantiation. The Lutheran, by consubstantiation. The chiefest of our opposites will not have us to be curious to understand the manner of Christs presence. For sayth Hooker, All things considered, and compared with that successe,

               which truth hath hitherto had by so bitter conflicts with errors in this poynt, shall I wish that men
               
               would more give themselves to meditate with silence what we have by the sacrament, and lesse to dispute of the manner how? The Bishop of Rochester commendeth the simplicity of the ancients, who disputed not whether Christ were present Con sub, in, or trans in the supper. What is this but to permit every man to adore upon what intention he pleaseth. But let the formalist be as free as may be, both of the Popish and Lutheran conceit, yet he is guilty of Idolatry two wayes: First, in that hee kneeleth by direction before a creature. Next, in that he doth kneele for reverence of the sacrament. As for the first, suppose it were true, that they kneeled not for reverence of the symbols, yet there is no difference betwixt them, and the more tollerable sort of Idolaters, Durandus, Holcot, Alphonsus, Mirandula, and the rest in their worshipping of Images. The Doctor sayth here, and againe pag. 55. that they worship not Christ in the bread, nor by the bread, nor the bread it selfe, but directeth the worship of their hearts and bodies immediatly to Christ in the heaven. So sayth that finer sort of Papists, that the cruc
                  •
               fix, or any other image is not either the materiall, or formall, the totall, or partiall object of their adoration, but that they direct immediatly their worship to Christ, or the Saint. He bringeth in Martyr, pag 74. saying, Contra Gardin. par. 3. ibi enim, & verbis, & symbolis, visibilibus ex citamur ad Christum ipsum & agnoscendum, & adorandum. 
               For there both by words and visible signes, we are stirred up, both to acknowledge, and to worship Christ himselfe. So sayth Swarez, Tom. 1. disput. 53. 54. that the image is not in their opinion, objectum quod, the object of their adoration,

but onely at the presence and sight of the image, the person represented by the image, is called to remembrance, that the image is an occasion, a mean and signe stirring up a man to adore the principall person represented, and that before it he worshipeth the principall after the same manner, as if he were present. For to direct worship by the image, is in their sence no other thing but to direct it immediatly to the principall, before the image, as Bellarmine declareth. de magnib. cap. 20. The 
                  ••
               mboles are then to the kneeler, objectum a quo s
                     ••
                  nificative, sayth Doctor Morton, Defence pag. 285. a signifying object to move the heart, and consequently the body to adoration. No more is the image to these Papists, and their adoration is as abstract from their object, as the kneeler is from his. But, sayth the Doctor, there is difference betwixt images, and the sacramentall symbols. The first, are the invention of men, and forbidden to be used in the worship of God, the other are Gods own ordinance, and commanded to be used in his worship: and cōfirmeth this his saying with the testimonies of Martyr; which needed not. For we deny not, that they are commanded to be used in Gods worship, as the worship of God is taken in a large sense, for his publick worship, and all the parts therof, the preaching of the word, ministration of the sacraments, &c. But they were not commanded to be used in the worship of God, as it is taken in a strict sence, in statu accommodato ad adorationem, for adoration properly so called, to fall down before them, and worship

Christ absent. The force of this argument must be this. Whatsoever thing God hath commanded to be used in his publick worship, we may lawfully fal down before it, and worship God by way of adoration properly so called. The sacramentall symbols are commanded to bee used in Gods publick worship: Therefore we may fall down before them and worship God. The weaknes of this argument is seen in the proposition, which I hope, they will not maintaine. If the Iewes had fallen before every significant object commanded by God to be used in time of divine service, they had continually committed Idolatry.
            P. Martyr professing in Oxford at that time, when kneeling was enjoyned to pacifie the Papists somewhat, who had made some stirres, pretending that the Sacrament was prophaned; was loath, being a stranger, to contradict the prescribed order, and his great friends, who called him to that place. He was forced afterward to defend, what he had written before, and through the importunity of Gardiner his adversarie, was driven to plaister the English adoration, with such speeches as cannot be well allowed. But even then, when hee was excusing, he was wishing it were not, and was ever warning them of the danger of it; and l

               se of the time; or the act of receiving? If it be unlawfull at any time, even for a moment, or in any act. God never ordained, that any act of his service should

be performed with any sinne, but rather in case there lay such a necessity on a man, that he cannot performe service to him without sinne, that he should omit his service. For God will not accept of sinne in no case. Next, why will they make scruple to kneele at the elevation, seeing it is then consecrated; it is objectum a quo significative; it is in the ministration of the Mysteries, in the time of Gods publick worship. God forbid, that we see the day, wherein he and his fellowes may do this without controulement. Suppose the Formalist did not commit Idolatry in bowing before the creature by direction, yet he committeth idolatry, in that he kneeleth for reverence of the creature. For to kneele before a creature, because of a reverent estimation of it, is to adore it. Because kneeling in religious worship, is ever the gesture of adoration. The formalist kneeleth for reverence of the Sacrament, and the sacramentall actions, taking, eating, drinking. For kneeling is enjoyned in the Kirk of England for reverence of the Sacrament, as the Ministers of Lincolne do prove in their Abridgment. Conformity with England is intended. Therefore kneeling for reverence of the Sacrament is intended. Next kneeling is enjoyned by the act of Perth, for reverent and due regard of so divine a Mysterie, as is the Sacrament. Seeing therfore the publick intent is to kneele for reverence of the Sacrament, let no man deceive himselfe with his own private intent; for his act must be interpreted before men

according to the publicke intent, and before God he shall be guilty, not onely of idolatry, but also of dissimulation. Otherwise he may go to Rome, and take kneeling Corpus Christi, out of the Popes own hand. Thirdly, this private intent, must either be for reverence of the Sacrament, or else with prophannesse, and mocking of God. For put the case he be praying in the act of beholding, hearing receiving, eating, drinking; he cannot, nor should not be praying all that time, and performe these actions also, as he ought to do, but sometimes he must have his senses, the members of his body, his mind exercised otherwise then in prayer, to wit, outwardly beholding, taking, eating, drinking; considering inwardly, what these signes, and rituall actions do meane. If in this time he be not praying, and yet kneeling, he is either mocking God, not caring for what respect he kneeleth; or else he kneeleth for reverence of these symbols, and actions, whereabout and wherin he is exercised. But the truth is, that the short 
                  •
               jaculations of the heart, wherof we shal speak afterward, may consist with any other actions, either civill or religious: but a set or continued prayer, cannot consist vvith any other actions, either civill or religious, except the gestures of prayer themselves, whether a man stand, sit, or kneele. If a man should be praying on his knees, and in the meane time be eating his meat, vvould ye not thinke, that that man vvere either mocking GOD, or

kneeled for reverence of his meat, and made an Idoll of it. Ye will say, the case is not alike: for the one is consecrated, and holv, the other is but common. Is not then, the kneeling at the one, and not at the other, for reverence, holinesse being the reason, wherfore a man doth kneele. As the King is the person honoured ut quae, and the Royall Dignity is the reason ut qua, wherby h

                  •
               eth that honour. So the bread is objectum quod, the object which is adored; the holinesse of it in that it is consecrate to signifie his body, is quo the reason, wherfore we kneele before such an object. With what face then, can men say that they kneel not for reverence of the elements, and actions employed about the elements? And this is more then I think a Papist will do to the crucifix
                  •
               : for except h

               ck, but he will not kneele; but here he kneeleth because he believeth he is taking and eating Christs very Body, and so he is consonant to himselfe: the Formalist is not so, but misapplyeth the Popish adoration.
            It is objected first, that we uncover our head, why may we not also bow ou
                  •
                knees: I answer, that we uncover our heads in the time of this action, as we doe at the hearing of the Scripture read, which we do for veneration, not for adoration. For in this Sacrament CHRISTS own words are heard, and his actions, which were divine and holy, reiterate, and therfore we owe reverence or veneration, but not adoration

for reverence, no more then at the hearing of the scripture read. For as Chrysostome sayth, In 2. Tim. hom. 2. Quemadmodum enim verba, quae locutus est Christus eadē sunt, quae sacerdotes nunc quòque pronunciantita & oblatio eadē est▪ eadem
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   baptismi ratio est, adeo omnia in fide consistunt. 
               As the words which Christ spake, are the same which the priests now pronounce, so is it the same oblation, the same baptisme: all things doe so consist together in the faith. And again, Homil▪ de proditio. Iudae. Et vox illa quidem semel dicta est, sed per omnes mensas ecclesiae usque ad hod

               that voyce was once pronounced, but it giveth firmnesse to this sacrifice through all the tables of the world to this day, and to his comming again. This veneration given to the word, and symbols in so holy an action, redoundeth to God himselfe, or Christ the author and institutor: for they are reverently respected for their sake, and therfore in the reverent usage of them, God is reverenced. As he that giveth almes to a poore man, is said to doe it to Christ, because he doth it for Christs sake, and honoureth Christ in the poore man. But in adoration God will have no mediate creature to goe betwixt him and the worshipper, howbeit he would pretend, that it is done for his sake; as all Idolaters doe pretend. Kneeling is the gesture of the high and divine worship, which the schoolemen call cultus latria, and never given in Scripture to any other, in religious worship: howbeit the Papists have given it also to inferiour creatures, which is their vile idolatry. It is not sufficient to say that in our adoration, non sistendum est in symbo
                     ••
                  , we must not rest upon the symbols, when as our adoration should not light up
               
                  ••
                the Symbols, or glance at them: for God will not have a glance of his worship bestowed upon any creature. It is objected next, that when the meate is set on our Tables,

vve uncover our heads, and do say grace. I answer, There is a relation here between God and the meat, but not a relation of vvorship, either from the meat to God, as if our vvorship did passe by the meat, and determine in God, or return from God, and determine in the meat. The meat is the subject vvherupon vve desire Gods blessing to be bestowed before vve use it. And therfore vve use the gestures of prayer, vvhich are used in blessing of other things, that is, vve stretch out our hands over our meat, or use the like demonstrative signe of the creature, vvhich vve desire God to blesse. Or sometimes vvithout any such indicant signe, vve expresse our selves with these or the like vvords, Vpon these thy good creatures, &c. When persons were blessed, or consecrated, if one, hands vvere layd upon that one: if many, then the Priest listed up both his hands, as high as his shoulders, toward or over them, and blessed all together. So is it in the blessing of the meat, o

Further, we differ not in one generall end, to wit, adoration, but we misapply that which they do. For they are employed about their God, as they think, when they are taking, eating, and drinking. And the Formalist is employed about bread and wine consecrate to an holy use: which are meere creatures even in his own conceit. It is conformity with all the true worshippers o

                thereof left; farre lesse should it be restored

where it hath bene out of use these threescore yeares by past, and cast away as a menstruous cloath. He telleth us that the Ark was in the Philistimes hands: that the gold, brasse, and Iron of Iericho was taken into the Lords treasure, and other like instances. The Arke was Gods own ordinance. The silver, the gold, the brasse, were not idolatrous, but the civill goods of idolaters. What God hath instituted, the abuse of men cannot take away: What belongeth to the idolater, not being idolatrous, not having state in the idolatrous service, if it may serve to some necessary, and profitable use, may be retained, the abuses being purged. But kneeling hath state in Gods service, and both had, and hath state in idolatrous service, and is of no necessary use. When we say that Ezekiah brake the brazen Serpent in peeces, howbeit it was Gods own appointed signe, and reserved for a monument of his mercy 700. yeeres: and that kneeling was not appointed of God: He telleth us, we are not bound to imitate the fact of Ezechias in the particular circumstances. It is not from the breaking of it in peeces, or the manner of abolishing it in particular, that we do reason, but from the abolishing of it in generall. So that kneeling be abolished, and altogether removed out of that place of divine service, we shall not contend for the different manner. He saith, the use of the brasen Serpēt ceased: The use wherefore it was first instituted ceased, but the other use, to be a monument of Gods

mercy, ceased not, and might have continued longer, if it had not beene abused. He saith kneeling shall have a profitable use so long as the world standeth. True: but not, kneeling before the elements of the Sacrament in the act of receiving. He saith Ezekiah brake the Idoll, but reserved the burning of Incense to God: So they have broken in peeces, the idoll of Reall presence, but reserved kneeling to Christ. But we say, that he abolished the burning of Incense not simply, for it was a part of Gods service, but burning of Incense before the brasen Serpent. So we crave not kneeling simply to be abolished, but kneeling before the elements in the act of receiving. P. A. p. 55. Sol. p. 38.
            
         
         
            Defence of our eleventh Argument.
            KNeeling in the act of receiving, is dangerous, being an occasion and provocation to idolatry. He sayth, we called it before idolatry, and now onely an occasion or provocation to it. We call it so now in a new argument: first giving and not granting that it were not idolatry. Next, we say, it is dangerous, because it is a provocation to another kinde of idolatry, beside that we spake of before, to wit, the grossest sort of worshipping the transubstantiated bread, or Christ bodily present. He sayth, we are prone to prophannesse as well as idolatry. But we should not give dangerous provocations, either to the one, or to the other. He

sayth, the Belgick Kirks making a Canon against kneeling for feare of bread worship, feared where there was no need of feare: for it hath been used in the Kirk of England without any such danger. Mr. Cartwrights(z) 1. Part. p. 164. report in a matter of fact, will get credit even with his adversaries. He sayth, That in divers places the people have knocked on their breasts, and holden up their hands, whilest the Minister was in giving of it, and not onely those who received it, but also those who looked on, and were in the Kirk.

               And before that time, even then when he wrote against Gardiner, he often fore warneth of the danger of it. Col. 160 
               Vt, quod mihi videtur, dicam, ad evitanda superstitionum pericula nolim hoc tempore. adorationis externae signa in Eucharistiae perceptione adhiberi, utut non ad symbola panis & vini, sed ad ipsum Christum in coelis regnantem derigerentur. Howbeit they should direct their worship, not to the symbols, but to Christ; yet he sayth there is danger of superstition in it. This was the best that ever Martyr could make of it, for throughly he could never digest it, and in that Epistle to the Polonians he is more free. Where he testifieth upon his own experience, what such pestilēt seeds of idolatry have wrought. I know what I spake, meaning no doubt the revolt of England: and who knoweth if there were the like triall, what the formalists would doe. So howbeit Papists are hardened, and increase to the feeling of all men, yet all the danger is not seen not felt, till the time of triall come. Beza sayth, Quaest. 243.

               Adoration in the very act of receiving, how dangero 
                     〈◊〉
                   it is, it being that which hath opened an occasion to breadworship, from whence at last Satan cast men down headlong to transubstantiation, the matter it selfe maketh manifest. And in his eight Epistle he sayth, that the event, and lamentable face of the Kirk, doth more then sufficiently teach us, how hurtfull it is; and commendeth these Churches which have abolished it, with no lesse care, then other apertas idolemanias manifest mad idolatry. What need I cite many testimonies, when as all the Divines

in well reformed Kirks do think the same; and yet he will say, that the Belgick Kirks feared where there was no need of feare. At last he telleth us, that a Synod in Pole made standing or kneeling indifferent, but sitting they condemned. That Synod was a confused or mixt Synod of sundry sorts of professors, some adhering to the Augustane confession, some to the Helvetian, some to the Bohemian. Next, they thought that the Arrians had been the first authors of sitting after the reformation, when as both the Scottish and Belgick Churches at that same time, and many yeares before, did use the gesture of sitting; and as worthy a Polonian, as that Church bred in his time, Iohannes Alasco, a Polonian Baron, wrot before the holding of that synod many years more amply, and more earnestly for sitting, then any other man els, and did put it in practise in the kirkes, where he bare office. So it was in them a grosse ignorance in a matter of fact, which was so publick in the view of all men. Thirdly, howbeit there was at that mixt Synod a great number of Lutherans, yet they consent with the rest, that no man should be urged to kneel; because it was neither the will of God, nor custome of the purer Kirk to censure, or punish godly men for externall rites. The Lutheran, yee may see, is more favourable in this poynt, howbeit he maintain Christs bodily presence, then these who would seem to be of our own profession. Sol. pag. 36. It is to be marked, that in this place the Doctor esteemeth

bread-worship to be no error in the foundation.
         
         
            Defence of our twelfth Argument.
            KNeeling in the act of receiving, say we, is will-worship. He sayth it is no part of Gods worship properly; and therfore it cannot be will-worship. This followeth not: for will-worship is of sundry sorts; as when a man inuenteth a new kinde of service to God, which hee never commanded; or when he misplaceth that vvhich God hath commanded, and useth it vvhere he will; or vvhen that, vvhich is not in the own nature vvorship, the user maketh it worship in his own conceit and opinion. Next, it followeth not, because that kneeling is a signe of vvorship, that therefore it is not worship properly; or because sometime we use it, and sometime not: for howbeit it be a signe of the internall adoration, yet is it the matter it selfe of externall adoration; for by it we do not onely signifie the affection of our heart, but also honoureth God, either in secret, or before men. For he that adoreth, honoureth; and we honour. God not onely with our spirit, but also with our body. As the Doctor himselfe said before; we direct to God, not onely the worship of our hearts, but of our body: When wee pray without kneeling we give spirituall vvorship, vvithout determination of that particular bodily vvorship at that time: but vvhen vve pray kneeling,

vvee cojoyne the bodily, and spirituall worship. Thirdly, it is not the kneeling outward onely, that we call will-worship, but that also wherupon kneeling doth usually attend, that is set and continued prayer. For we say, that in the act of receiving, there is not the proper time and place of set and continued prayer; wherof we shall intreat in the own place. To pray then, is Gods worship, but to pray in an unfit time, to displace any other part of God worship, is will-worship.
         
         
            Defence of our thirteenth Argument.
            VVEE say, that kneeling entred into the Kirk under Antichrist: whether Honorius was the first deviser of it, or not, we regard not as a point materiall. It appeareth that Honorius decreed onely an inclination, or bowing of the super our bulk of the body at the elevation, but not kneeling. If he ordained so much to be done at the elevation, it is likely that in the act of receiving, kneeling was either then also ordained, or come in a little after. But whether before, or after, is not the chiefe question. It is sufficient, that it was not in use in the Kirk of God for a 1000. years, or before the time at least, when the Antichrist was at his height. For there is not one expresse testimony in all the ancient Writers for kneeling in the act of receiving,

except some counterfeit worke; yea, not so much as in any counterfeit work, so farre as we have yet seen alledged, except in one Cyrillus. The censure of Moulins upon these Catechismes of Cyrillus is marked and set down already in Perth Assembly P. A. p. 60.. I adde the censure of the Bishop of Spalato, who saith, 
                  De rep. eccl. li. 
                  
                     •

                        •
                     umer. 69. that the Catechismes which go abroad under the name of Cyrillus Hierosolymitanus, are to him greatly suspected, for they smell of farre posterior times: and he setteth down the reasons of his judgment. Beza saith, that kneeling in the act of receiving, brought in Popish bread-worship, and transubstantiation, because, it may be, he gave some credit to Cyrillus; but it is very likely that it came in after the opinion of the reall presence, and transubstantiation. For as I have said, there is not a testimony we can heare of, yet alledged for kneeling, within the space of a 1000. yeares. And suppose that kneeling went before the opinion of Reall Presence, or Transubstantion, yet even then it was, (and no other wayes it could be) the Formalists idolatry, preparing the way to, or rather drawing on the worshipping of Christ as bodily present, or the bread transubstantiated into his body. For I have already declared, that kneeling in the act of receiving, eating and drinking, cannot be but idolatrous. Many grosse corruptions were in the Kirk before the opinion of the Reall Presence, or Transubstantiation prevailed. Seeing then it came in under the Antichrist, whether should we

follow the Antichrist, and his Lawes, or Christ his holy Institutions.
         
         
            Defence of our foureteenth Argument.
            KNeeling in the act of receiving is scandalous to many. He saith that wee ought to do our duty, though men be never so much offended, otherwise the scandall is not given, but taken: our duty is to obey the ordinance of the Kirk made anent kneeling, and not to offend the Kings Majesty. Here ye see first he opponeth offending, that is greeving or displeasing the Kings Majestie, to offending, that is, giving occasion to his brother to fall in a grosse sinne, and so to distroy him, for whom Christ died, so far as in him lyeth. Next suppose that(g) Quando ipsum factū est tale, quod de sui ratione habeat, quod sit inductivum ad peccandum, puta cū aliquis publice facit peccatū, vel quod habet similitudinem peccati. 2. 2. quest. 43. art. 1. ad 4. kneeling in the act of receiving the sacramentall elements, were not a sinne, both in disordering the right manner of celebration, and also in that it is idolatry; yet it is a matter of actiue scandall, in that it hath a shew of evill, and giveth occasion to our brother to fall into that evill, wherof it hath a shew, to wit in bread-worship. For a mans doing is the cause of anothers fall, two wayes, per se, of it selfe, or per accidens, through the default of another onely, who is ill affected, and taketh occasion to offend, even at good things. The first is actiue scandall, the second is passive. In the active, sometime there is intentio operantis, an intention

in the doer to draw another to sin: sometime there is without any such intention, onely conditio operis, such a manner of doing, that of it selfe it giveth occasion to another to fail. As when a man doth such an act, which is an inducement to sinne; as when a man committeth publiquely a sinne, or that which hath the shew, or likenesse of sinne, saith Aquinas. This shew of idolatry that is in kneeling, suppose there were no more, is an inducement and occasion to others to commit idolatry, & hardneth the Papist in his idolatry; It is an active, not a passive scandall. We must not omit a necessary duty, suppose others unjustly take offence. But kneeling in the act of receiving is not a necessary duty, but such a deed as is inductive to scandall.

                  ris proxima scandali, the neerest and immediate matter of the scandall, to deny that lege cominum, by the common law, the law of God and men▪ Magistrates and Superiours should be obeyed. But lege particulari by a particular law made of any particular matter, wee are not ever bound to active obedience; as when he commandeth to sinne, or do any thing that hath the shew of sinne, or is apt to breed scandall; like as kneeling

in the act of receiving hath proved by the event, or experience both of the ages before and at this present. Neither is in this same case obedience passive denyed; and so the Morall duty of obedience is fulfilled. Daniel would not desist from opening his windowes toward Ierusalem not withstanding of the Kings edict. The commandement of the Magistrate cannot make a thing, which of it selfe is scandalous, and hurtfull, not to bee hurtfull, but rather by the strength of his authoritie maketh it more scandalous and hurtfull, then it would be. But none of our Formalists will deale in earnest with the supreme Magistrate, and tell him that he committeth active scandall in laying a stumbling block before the people, and therfore sinneth against the LORD. The Nurse that left a knife vvith the child found dead at her returne, could not be free of blame; but the Nurse that layeth downe the knife, is farre lesse to be excused. Ez

Seeing therefore there is passive scandall in this kneeling, it is sufficient cause to remove it, suppose there vvere no active. Will the flattering Formalist then bee instant vvith the Magistrate to remove, or rather not to reinduce this passive scandall, and follovv the example of good Ezekias. For this invention of man, hath beene, is, and is still likely to be abused superstitiously, giving and not granting that of it selfe it vvere not

Last, it is no lawfull ordinance, which was made at Perth, as all our arguments doe evince▪ neither vvas that meeting a lawfull and free Synod, but a Null and pretended Assembly, vvhich they are never able, doe vvhat they can, to defend. The Doctor fayth, he feareth some Ministers do cause the people to take offence. Surely, if they were not constant in their doctrine, and practise, as they have professed these many yeares, they would cause the people take offence at the vvhole doctrine, vvhich they have taught, and to call it in doubt. Let them alone sayth he, they be blind leaders of the blind. Certainly, vvho vvill be lead by this vvorthy vvork of the Doctors, I affirme he is either a temporizer seeking a cloake for his back-sliding, or els he is blind, led by a blind Doctor: or if he be not blind, he is blinded vvith avarice and ambition, or hath a part of both.
         
         
            Defence of our fifteenth Argument.
            HE maketh us an argument of every thing, wherewith we exaggerate their fault. We say, that Bellarmine argueth

               a priori from the real presence for adoration▪ and againe, a posteriori from adoration for the reall presence. And if it bee lawfull to kneele at the receiving of the sacrament, it is lawful to kneele before images. He sayth, We may fal down before the symbols, which we have already refuted. He sayth, that the Papist worshipeth Christ, & the image with one worship, Christ and the Eucharist as being one. What is that to the purpose, that the idolatry of the Papist, and of the formalist, is not all one in every respect, seeing he misapplieth onely the popish adoration, as I have sayd before. Bellarmine sayth not, that Christ and the image is to be worshiped with one vvorship after one manner: for Christ is to be vvorshiped vvith that high worship called cultus latriae, and that properly, the image of Christ improperly, and per accidens; as he that adoreth the King, adoreth him and his purple robe at one time with one vvorship, but after a divers manner. So in the sacrament they adore Christ and the species together with the same vvorship, but not after the same manner: for they worship the accidents and species, onely per accidens, vvith that vvorship vvhich they give unto Christ, as in the coadoration of the Kings throne, or his robe, when the King is worshipped. But the formalist kneeleth for reverence of the elements, not per accidens, but perse, howbeit propter alium. Now to kneele for reverence is to adore with that gesture, which in scripture is used in religious and divine vvorship to be given onely to God.
         
         
            
            Defence of our sixteenth Argument.
            THe ancient Kirk received not the communion kneeling. Vpon the Lords day it was the custome to stand, and that for a thousand years, even in time of publick prayer. He sayth, that howbeit in time of prayer they stood on the Lords day, to testifie their profession of Christs resurrection, yet at the celebration of the supper they might have kneeled. I ask then, was it more needful to testifie their profession of Christs resurrection in time of prayer, then in the act of receiving the elements. It was that day, that they observed vvith such a rite, because Christ rose on that day, and not a part of the day. The Canons and testimonies for not kneeling on the Lords day, some of them make mention of the time of prayer, because otherwayes at other times they kneeled in time of prayer. Some vvithout any particular mention of prayer time, or more generall. And therefore Zonaras vvriting upon the sixt Councell holden in Trullo, Can. 90. forbidding Post vespertinum sacerdotum ad altare in sabbatho ingressum. ex cōsuetudine quae servatur, nemo genu flectat usque ad sequentē vesperam in die Dominico. to bow the knee from the

Iustiuus Martyr sayth, that vvhen they vvere beginning this action, they arose, and stood; and vvhen prayer vvas ended, did communicate. The Doctor sayth, it may be, that how beit they arose, and stood on their feet, that they communicated kneeling. He hath not so much as any appearance out of Iustinus vvords, and yet vvill answer, It might have been done with kneeling. Further, they cannot produce(k) Hist lib. 7. cap. 8. one testimony out of authentick antiquity, to prove that they kneeled; howbeit vve produce testimonies for standing, as the ma

Next, seeing the Deacons dispensed the elements to the communicants, whether before that time in the Apostles dayes, did the Minister dispense the elements out of his own hands, or not. It is not likely, if that had been their office, that they would have transferred that office to Deacons Deacons ministring at tables for the love-feasts, were the s

Thereafter words were put in their mouthes. At last they were made halfe Priests, and got power to teach and baptize. To conclude, howsoever the ancient kirk kneeled not in the act of receiving;

their other customes, of standing, and turning the due celebration of the supper into a forme of Iewish sacrificing, as Calvin sayth, 
                  Justit. lib. 4. c. 18, s. 11. and many other corruptions, which entred in very soone, are not to be followed of us. Not long after the Apostles dayes, sayth(p) Justit. lib. 4 c. 17. s 43. Quam non longe ab Aposiolorum aetate coena Domini tacta rubigine fuerit; sed isthaec scilicet humanae confidentiae procacitas est, quae se continere nequit, quin semper in Dei mysterijs ludat & lasciviat.

            Defence of our seventeenth Argument.
            WEE say that in the act of receiving the Saciamentall elements; we should meditate, and consider the analogie of the signe, and the things signified; attend with our minds, exercise our senses, because of the externall Symbols, and rituall actions, wherabout they are employed; and that it is not a fit time of solemne prayer, and thankesgiving, and consequently that in the ect of receiving wee should not kneele. He formeth his second Argument flat contrariwise in this manner. In worshipping God with solemne prayer and thankes giving we may lawfully kneele. In the act of receiving the Sacrament wee

worship GOD with solemne prayer and thankes giving. Ergo, in the act of receiving the Sacrament we may lawfully kneele. We deny the assumption, for the reason already alledged, to wit, that it is not a fit time of solemne prayer and thanks giving when men have their outward senses, and members of their bodies outwardly, and the powers of their soule inwardly otherwise employed. He proveth his assumption, both here, and in his second Argument after this manner: We should meditate on Christs death; We cannot remember of his death, except we remember also that by his death life commeth unto us; we cannot remember of this, without remembrance of our own misery. The remembrance of our miserie ministreth matter of prayer: Therfore the remembrance of Christs death causeth prayer and thanks giving: praver, that by his death we may have life; thanksgiving, for the benefit of redemption. Ye see the whole force of his reason dependeth upon the duty of remembrance of Christs death. Now Becanus the Iesuit saith De communione sub utra que specie cap. 12. That divers wayes we may remember of the benefit of redemption, which Christ hath conquered to us by his death. First, in participation of the Sacrament of the Enchartist: Next, in reading the Gospell, where his death and passion is described. Thirdly, at the sight of an Image, which representeth him and his Passion. If therfore at the sight of a Crucifixe the Doctor be put in remembrance of Christs death, should he blot out

so good a thing out of his mind? If not, how then can he remember of Christs death, but he must also remember of his miserie, & the benefite gotten by his death, and so burst forth in that very time, and act (for so doth he reason) into prayer, and that kelgiving. To say, that we are forbidden to performe that duty before a crucifix, is to grant that we ought not, and lawfully may not bow down, whensoever we remember of Christs death: And it we may not doe it before a ciucifix, by his own grant, we say we may not do it, when there is any other, or the like impediment, as there are many. For howbeit we remember of Christs death when we are most busied in our worldly affaires, yet we must not burst forth into lelemne prayer and thanks-giving. When the historie of the Passion is read, we are put in remembrance of his death; and yet in the act of hearing that Hysto

In the act of receiving the sacramentall elements there is like wise impediments, that we may not burst forth in solemne prayer and thanksgiving, and kneele in the very act it selte of receiving. First, the solemne prayer and thanks-giving

When the crucifix, or any other image is condemned in the second commandement, all other creatures for the like use are condemned. He saith, if a man fall down on his knees where the Idoll is, praying against the idolatry committed in that place, no man seeing him to take offence: or if he will turne his face from the Idoll he doeh not unlawfully. He doth unlawfully three wayes. First, in that be kneeleth where he needeth not to kneele; for kneeling is not a necessary a

But wee vvill not insist in this instance of his, seeing it is not pertinent to our purpose; for vve are novv speaking of a publike and voluntatie vvorship vvithout any protestation contrarie to our fact.

                that the minde may comprehend divers things together, and that the heart

may be touched vvith divers affections at one time. There is no man doubteth of this, it being taken in a right sense. For the soul of man hath sundry povvers and faculties, vvhich concurre to the mutuall help of other: one povver removing impediments out of the vvay, that another povver may vvork the ovvn operation the more easily: one power being subordinate to another; and the superiour by some influence applying the inferiour to some worke. Sundry and divers powers of the soule, and Christian graces, are working together in our religious exercises. But our question is not of one action, or exercise, but whether the same power of the soule at one time, and yet durable, work in divers actions, and exercises. The Schoolemen dispute concerning Christ, whether in reaching and giving the bread to the disciples, hee did both offer a sacrifice, uttering the words of consecration, as they call them, and reach to them the bread, without any distraction of minde. They say, that not, Physica duratione, & concomitantia metaphysica, sed mor

                  li tantum, that he first uttered the words and offered, before he gave the bread in their hands, and there was two actions one succeeding another according to physicall consideration, howbeit morally both made but one action. There is in the act of receiving presupposed two actions, one of mentall prayer, another of communicating, that is, taking, eating, drinking. Mentall prayer is either a short ejaculation of the soule,

which endureth for a moment, and is called by the Divines, transitoria vel jaculatoria oratio: or else it is durable and permanent, and is called oratio continua. As for the first, there is no action so laborious, or earnest, or worldly, let be religious, but it may consist with it, without distraction of the soule from that action, Etiam in medio strepitu, & clamore hominum, In the midst of the noyse and clamours of men, saith Hom. 79. ad populu

Not onely momentanean petitions, but every godly motion, and elevation of the mind, is called by the divines, by this name of mentall prayer. These require not, nor cannot, because of the action with which they are mixed, have geniculation to attend them. For geniculation during for a certaine time must attend upon a permanent action of prayer, and not upon a transient, This transitorie ejaculation may, and doth consist with the taking of the Sacramentall elements, eating, and drinking, seeing it may, and doth consist with all other our actions, even taking, eating, drinking, at our common meales. It is the permanet action of mentall prayer which we deny, can consist with the act of receiving, eating, drinking. The understanding cannot in one continued act be employed in a continued operation, about another action during the same time without distraction, and consequently without unreverent behaviour.
            If a man were speaking to a Prince, and

mind all that time another thing, if it were possible, it were unreverent behaviour especially if his behaviour were manifested by some outward signes, and employment about other actions, howbeit otherwayes commendabl

               . Our opposites must either confesse, that during that act of receiving, eating, drinking I mean not onely the soule, but one power of the soule, As for example the intellectuall faculty is exercised by a permanent operation in the action of prayer during the time of their geniculation, and also at the same time, the same faculty of the understanding is exercised by a permanent operation in another action, considering the analogy of things sensible with things invisible, according as the symbols, and every rite ministreth occasion of meditation, which is the carefull inquisition of the soule. And so confesse that they doe both a thing unpossible, and unseemly, or els, that one action succeedeth another, and that geniculation is in respect of both, which is idolatry. Yee suppose the first were supposed to be true and possible, that both the permanent actions must consist together, yet were it also idolatry. For mentall prayer should be concealed at all times in publick, and ought not to be expressed by signes and gestures of prayer outwardly: farre lesse in the place, where it cannot be done without idolatry, or a shew of idolatry: for otherwise the three children might have bowed before the golden image: and Nehemias, when hee stood before the King.

            Answer to his ten Arguments for kneeling
            I Have no will to spend another sheet of paper on them, therefore I will be short. To the first: All our former arguments proue this kneeling not to be indifferent. Sitting we think not so necessary, as that there could not be a sacrament without it, but to the due ministration of the sacrament we think a table-gesture necessary. As for the gesture of sitting, we think that the example of the first supper, seconded with the practise following, should be equivalent to a precept, seeing it is so taken in other matters of policie. Howbeit to sit be not in the Categorie of actions, yet it necessarily presupposeth local motion, vvhich is an action. And Christ cōmanding them in these words, Doe this, comprehended not onely deeds, but also words, and the whole forme of the celebration,

as if he hadisayd, celebrate this supper, is yee see we have now celebrated it The rest of the confirmation of this Arment hath been answered in the defence of our first, second and sixth arguments, and the two former treatises. His second and third arguments are answered in our seventeenth argument. The sensible manner of giving in the sacrament, is one of the chiefe reasons, wherefore we should not kneele; least we seem to adore the means when vve are in the very use of them. And as for the spirituall manner, we receive these same things in the word one by one, as vve do in the sacrament, howbeit outvvardly the vvord sound generally to the eares of all. We uncover our heads, when the scripture is read not for adoration, but veneration, whereby vve discerne betwixt it, and the voyce of men. To kneele vvhen the vvord is read, is to adore in the time of another action, and confound them, or rather to omit the duty of hearing vvith such attention, as we are bound to; or else to adore the word it selfe, which is idolatry, or else to mock God, and his publique worship. Of this we have spoken sufficiently in the seventeenth Argument. Yea, further, suppose it were lawfull to kneele at the hearing of the Word read, it is not lawfull to bow down before a creature in the Sacrament. To the fourth Argument: a table-gesture we hold necessary to the due ministration, suppose sitting in speciall be not so necessarie, it followeth not kneeling is as necessarie, as sitting,

because kneeling is no table-gesture; the rest is answered in our 1. 2. 6. 7. Arguments. His fifth Argument is answered in our 1. and 2. Arguments. His six
                  •
                is answered in our first Argument. The gesture of Christ at preaching and prayer, was variable; and therfore we may v

                  •
               chall suppers, and at this last Supper was one, and in a rituall action requiring some competent gesture. The seventh Argument is answered in our 16. Argument. That the Ancients changed sitting into standing, was done without good reason: Their liberty of changing that, and many other things in the Sacrament, drew on at last the abominabl Masse, and the breadie God. I
                  •
                the Church now should take greater liberty, and change from siting or standing to kneeling, as they did, it were but to proceed from worse to worse. For there is great difference betwixt change of one Tablegesture into another, and a change of a Table-gesture into a gesture of adoration. The eighth Argument is answered in the 8. 9. 1
                  •
               . 11. Arguments. To the ninth, Howbeit the Lutheran thinketh that Christ is not to bee adored in the bread, out of the use of the Sacrament; yet in the use and in the act of receiving, they kneele; because of their opinion of the reall presence of Christs body. The rest hath bene answered in our 11. Argument. The tenth doeth not conclude for kneeling, and impugneth sitting as thoug
                  •
                urged necessarily by us. When as we onely ground upon Christ, and his Apostles sitting,

and other rites, the necessitie of a Tablegesture, not to the essence of a Sacrament, but to the due ministration of that action: that the rest of the commanded rites may be performed, which cannot be performed with a gesture of adoration. Sitting wee thinke ought not to be changed, no not into standing, without some waighty consideration of some urgent occasion, because it was the gesture of Christ, his Apostles, and the Apostolicall Kirkes; it is the ordinary gesture of guests at feasts, and resembleth best the familiar accesse of the soule to the spirituall Table. As for types of our Supper in heaven, and sitting at it, we have answered in the defence of the seventh Argument.
            VVHat I have omitted in the answer to his ten Arguments, is either not worthy of answer, or already answered in the preceeding defence, as also in the two former treatises.
