            ¶IMPRINTED AT LONDON by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. Anno 1613.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE, LORD ARCHbishop of Canterburie his Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane: And one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Counsell.
            
               AS in the Romane triumphes, the worthy Conquerour gloriously ascending vnto the Capitoll, did shew his magnificence by giuing ample gifts vnto the people: euen so (most reuerend father) our victorious Sauiour and noble Redeemer, hauing conquered Hell, Death, Diuell and damnation, Triumphantly ascending to the Capitoll of Heauen, did shew his vnspeakeable bountie in giuing admirable and incommparable gifts vnto men,Ephes. 4. 8. 11. That is, some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, some Pastours and Teachers. For what hath the Church of God of so precious account, as the holy ministery of the Word and Sacraments, whereby CHRIST IESVS with all his blessings is reuealed and applied to the soule and conscience? It may well be resembled to the Riuers of Paradise, which did water and fructifie the GardenGen. 2. 10. of God: to the Golden pipes, whereby the two Oliue branches replenishedZach. 4. 2, 3. the seuen Lampes in the golden Candlesticke: to the Crowne (which the woman in the Reuelation cloathed with the Sunne, and hauing the Moone vnder herReuel. 12. 1. feete, had vpon her head) being richly beset, not with stones, but with Starres.
            Which holy function flowing from CHRIST, as from the fountaine to his

blessed Apostles, was by thē deriued to posterity. But as the water which neere the spring is cleare and chrystalline, in further passages may be polluted: so in processe of time, (by the subtiltie of Satan) the Ministery of the Word and Sacraments being the ordinance of God was mingled with sacrifising and other humane inuentions. Yet such was the goodnesse of God, that euen in the darknes of Poperie▪ as Baptisme, so the Ministeriall function (notwithstanding the abominations cleauing thereunto) was wonderfully preserued; for the Church of Rome, by Gods speciall prouidence, in her Ordination of Priests, reteined such Euangelicall words, as in their true and natiue sense, include a2. Cor. 5. 18. 19. ghostly Ministeriall power to forgiue sinnes, by the Ministery of Reconciliation, consisting in the due administration of the Word and Sacraments. So remission of sinnes is ascribed to the Minister, as to Gods instrument in effecting it, and Ambassadour in pronouncing it. Wherefore in that they haue authority to forgiue sinnes, they haue also authority to vse the meanes thereof, that is the Word and Sacraments. Thus the Church of Rome gaue power to her Priests to teach the truth, although it did not reueale the truth vnto them.
            Now when it pleased him, which causeth the Light to shine out of darkenesse, in the riches of his Mercie, to remember his distressed Church, those blessed instruments which hee first vsed in the Reformation, were such as had receiued their Calling corruptly in the Church of Rome: But when their eyes were opened, they disclaimed the sacrifising abomination, and other impurities, which by the iniquitie of the time were incorporated into their calling. Thus the pollution of Poperie (by the Grace of God) was drained and drawn away▪ & the Ministeriall function restored to the original beautie.
            And here let vs admire and magnifie the Mercy of God, who did not forget this remote Iland situate in a corner of the world, but did most graciously shine vpon it with his Golden beames from the Sphere of Heauen▪ For whereas in other Countreys the Bishops which should be starres and Angels of the Church, did resist the Reformation, and persecuted such as sought it; It pleased God that in England, among other Bishops, Archbishop Cranmer, the chiefest Prelate of the Kingdome, was Gods chiefest instrument to restore the Gospel, which afterward he sealed with his blood; The euent whereof was, That whereas other Reformed Churches were constrained by necessity to admit extraordinary fathers, That is, to receiue Ordination from Presbyters, which are but inferior Ministers, rather then to suffer the Fabrick of the Lord IESVS to be dissolued: the Church of England had alwayes Bishops to conferre sacred Orders, according to the ordinary and most warrantable custome of the Church of CHRIST. And although in Queene Maries time, fiue blessed Bishops were burned to ashes, yet God reserued to himselfe a number, which being then forced

to take the wings of the Doue, and fly beyond the Seas, or to hide themselues in the clefts of the rocke; when the tempest was ouerblowne, the cloudes cleared, and the Sunne of Righteousnes began to display himselfe in the happy raigne of Queene Elizabeth, returned againe, clapped their wings for ioy, praised God, preached the Gospel, and with holy imposition of hands, ordained Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the Church of England.
            
            These are the Ordinations which reprochfull Papists doe most traduce and slander, as though they were no Ordinations at all, but onely Nullities; thence perswading their Proselytes, That our present Ministers are no Ministers, but meerely Lay-men, and thereupon inferring that wee haue no Church, no saluation. In which point some Popish Recusants haue beene so confident, that they haue professed, That if we could iustifie our Calling, they would come to our Churches, and bee of our Religion. The consideration whereof (most Reuerend father) gaue me occasion to made into this Controuersie, being desirous, next the assurance of mine owne saluation, as I am a Christian, to bee fully and clearely assured of my Calling, as I am a Minister. In prosecuting whereof, I did euidently find, That their chiefest Obiections are nothing but slanders, confutable by Authenticall monuments of publique Record. Whereupon I wished, from the bottome of my heart, That some learned man would haue vouchsafed for the glory of God, and the good of the Church, to scatter these Popish mistes, and to set the Trueth in the cleare light.
            A worke in my opinion very important; First in respect of vs of the Ministerie; and secondly in regard of the people committed to our charge. For how chearefully, and with what ioy of heart may we preach▪ and they heare vs, when the lawfulnesse of our Calling is made manifest to all men? Thirdly, If any haue formerly made scruple to enter our Orders, out of ignorance, how these odious and scandalous imputations blazed in Popish Bookes might bee truely answered, and the point soundly cleared by Record, it is verely to bee hoped, That all such shall receiue singular comfort, when they see our Calling iustified not onely in it selfe, as the true Ministerie of the Gospel, but also in regard of the deriuation to vs by such Bishops, and in such maner as is most correspondent to the sacred Scripture, and the practise of Primitiue Antiquitie. And if any vpon this surmise bee fallen away to our aduersaries, who knoweth what effect God may worke in them, when they shall plainely perceiue how they haue bene deluded with Popish stratagemes? Or who can tell whether this may bee a gracious meanes to stay others from yeelding to the inticements of subtill serpents? Finally, the defence of innocencie in a matter of so high a nature, must needes reioyce the hearts of the godly, when Popish polititians shall bee forced to hide their faces for shame, and confusion. These motiues

induced mee to wish, that some great Master in our Israel would haue vndertaken this eminent Argument, which now (the Diuine prouidence so disposing) is befallen vnto me, One of the children of the Prophets.
            Which my labours concerning the Ordination of the Pastours of England, to whom should I rather present, then to your Grace, whom God (by the meanes of a most prudent and Religious Soueraigne,) hath to the singular comfort of all that sincerely loue the Gospel, aduanced to bee the chiefe Pastour, and chiefe Ordainer in the Church of England? Especially, seeing I proceeded in this Argument with your graces fatherly direction, and incouragement. Now the Lord so direct and sanctifie your endeuours, That as the Rod of Aaron did bud and blossome, and bring foorth ripe Almonds: soNum. 17. 8. the Church and Ministerie of England by the meanes of your Grace, as of Gods blessed instrument, may prosper, flourish and bring foorth fruits of Righteousnesse to the glory of God, and the comfort of all true Christian hearts.
            
               Your Graces in all humble duetie at command FRANCIS MASON.

It is the Queene and Lady of Cities, the Store-house of Nature, the admiration of Art, the Epitome of the world; wherein all Excellencies shine in their Orient colours, and exquisite beautie. In old time men did wonder at the Temple of Diana, the Tombe of Mausolus, the Colossus of the Sunne, the Image of Iupiter Olympicus, the Palace of Cyrus, the walls
                     
                     of Babylon, and the Pyramides of Egypt, because these things in their seuerall ages were rare and singular, and iustly had in precious account. But who would now so esteeme them, when he may see in one City so many spectacles which are able, not onely to rauish the beholders with admiration, but also to strike them with astonishment?

And surely though the walles of our Cities were of gold, and the windowes of Saphire, yet while we liue in this vale of vanitie, we dwell but in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust.

                  You say well sir, and the right way to attaine thereunto, is to be reconciled to the holy Church of Rome; Without it, there is no hope of saluation; within it, is a very Paradise of God, and a sanctuary for all distressed soules: wherefore if you take this course, you shalbe a thrice happy man, and enioy the precious blessing of a quiet conscience.

                  In deede a quiet conscience is a iewell of iewels, the price of it is farre aboue the Pearle, neither can it be valued with the wedge of fine gold. But this is a flower which groweth not in the gardens of Rome, no not in Beluidêre the Popes Paradise. For there is no Religion in the world which can pacific the troubled conscience, but that onely which teacheth the penitent spirit the remission of his sinnes, and an infallible certaintie of his saluation, by the merits of Iesus Christ apprehended by a true and liuely faith, and sealed to the sanctified soule by the Spirit of grace.

As for the Masters and Professours of our Colledges, specially the Romane Readers, we may be bold to say, they be in all kind the most choise and cunning men of Christendome. Now for that part of education which appertaineth to Christian life and maners, our chiefe indeuour is to breed in our Schollers deuotion, which is done by diuers spirituall exercises, and dayly examinations of their consciences, often receiuing the blessed Sacrament, much praying, continuall hearing, and meditation of holy things. So by these meanes a number of the best wittes of England, are here trained vp, most happy in regard of their rare education.

You vaunt of your varietie of exercises, God giue vs grace to glory in the simplicitie of his Trueth, with the testimonie of a good conscience. As for the exercises of our Vniuersities, you might know (if malice did not blinde you) that they are famous throughout the Christian world and that these Campes of Christ haue from time to time trained vp Souldiers, able to encounter the proudest Philistines. Neither doubt we but they shall alwayes haue a Dauid to cut off the head of Golias with his owne sword. Which wee rather hope, because of that Treasurie of Learning and Languages lately erected, I meane that renowned Library, the honour of Oxford, the Iewell of England, the admiration of strangers, and the Phaenix of the world. O noble Bodley, many Benefactours haue done worthily euen in this kind, but thou surmountest them all. Blessed is the stocke which brought foorth such a branch, and blessed is the branch which yeelds so pleasant fruit. Deuonshire was the mother, Merton Colledge the nurse to this most gracious plant: happie mother, happie nurse, happy plant.

and to the vtter ouerthrow of Antichrist. But to come to the Romish Readers which you so commend, what are they like, or to whom shall I compare them? They are like to Italian Mountebanckes, who will price an oile at sixe hundred Crownes, which is not worth sixe pence. Whatsoeuer they bring must be admired for rare and excellent, as though it were found in the Phoenix nest. By these glosing meanes partly guilded ouer with golden promises, and partly working vpon male-contented humors, (for you delight to fish in troubled waters) you haue preuailed with many, and applaud them as the best wits of England. So long as they stay with vs you account them but Leaden-wits: if once they set a foot within your Seminaries, they are presently Metamorphised and become Golden. But let your Orders be exquisite, your Readers skilful, your Students wittie and painfull, I would gladly know what is the end of all this rare education.

This he indeuoureth to proue, because Pope Gregorie calleth himselfe Caput fidei, the head of faith; Whence he inferreth this conclusion, Ita

Gregory witnesseth, when men goe about, either to trouble, diminish or take away the Primacie of the See Apostolicke, they goe about to cut off the very head of faith, and to dissolue the state of the whole body, and of all the members. So he is not content to make his new head equall to other heads, but he will haue it to be Ipsum fidei caput, The very head it selfe; singularly

and supereminently mounted aboue all other heads. Thus the Popes Supremacie is become the Supreme article of your Catholicke faith. But how farre extendeth this Supremacie? The same Romane Reader teacheth, That if Bell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 5. c. 7. ergo tria. 
                     a Prince, of a sheepe or a ramme become a wolfe, That is, of a Christian become an heretick, the Pastour of the Church may driue him away by Excommunication, and withall command the people that they doe not follow him, and therefore may depriue him of his dominion ouer his Subiects. Yea, hee teacheth that the Pope may Bell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 5. c. 6. quantum. 
                     change Kingdomes, take them from one, and giue them to another, as the chiefe Spirituall Prince, if it be necessary for the saluation of soules. But when shall it be holden necessary? That may appeare by the dealing of Sententia declaratoria cont. Eliz. apud Sand. de schis. l. 3. pag. 315. 
                     Pius Quintus against Queene Elizabeth: for when that vertuous Princesse had banished the Pope, and Popish abominations, and planted the Gospel of Iesus Christ, continuing constant in the profession thereof, her Religion he iudged heresie, her constancie he called obstinacie, and thereupon pronounced her depriued of her Crowne and dignitie, dissolued the sacred bond of Allegiance, and cursed all that should obey her. Which proceedings he called Arma iustitiae, the weapons of Iustice, pretending he was constrained thereunto Adarma Iustitiae, contra eam de necessitate conuersi. ibidem. 
                     of necessitie. Wherefore if a Prince shall banish Idolatrie and superstition, and continue zealous in the reformation of Religion, it shalbe iudged a iust, sufficient, and necessary cause of depriuation. Thus you make a shew of Learning and Religion, but traine vp your schollers to treason and rebellion. Is this the preaching of the Catholicke faith? Is this the ghostly good of your Countrey? Is this the Popes incomparable loue? And as hee hath small loue to England, so notwithstanding his faire pretences, he beareth not very much to you: for the Pope being an old polititian, may be well resembled to the Mariner, which looketh one way, and roweth another; He sendeth you ample gifts, but he sendeth them vpon a hooke, and while you catch at the bait, you swallow the hooke. And as the Fisher baiteth with little fishes to catch the greater, so the Pope being a cunning Fisher, vseth you but for a bait to catch England, and there to restore his Golden Supremacie, which may be called Golden, because it brought vnto him mountaines of Siluer and Gold. But that you may the better perceiue the dangerous state wherein you stand, giue me leaue to vse a plaine, but a fit comparison; An Ape seeing a Chesnut in the fire, and not knowing how to get it, spied a Spaniel by the fire side, and suddenly catched his foote to rake out the chesnut. Here you may see your owne faces in a homely glasse. The Golden Supremacie is the Chesnut, perils and dangers are the fire, the Pope loath to burne his owne fingers, vseth you but as the Spaniels foote to scrape for the Chesnut; little regardeth hee how you be scorched, so hee bee in hope to obtaine his desire. But though many of you haue burned both your handes and your hearts, yet hitherto (God be thanked) he hath missed the Chesnut.

                     The Lord rebuke them: but if they speake of ignorance (as I hope they do) then I say with the holy Martyr S. Stephen, 
                     Acts 7. 60. 
                     Lord, lay not this sinne to their charge; Or with our blessed Sauiour, Luke 23. 34. 
                     Father, forgiue them, they wote not what they do. For that faith and Religion which is agreeable to the Scripture is true, holy, ancient, Catholicke and Apostolicke: But the faith and Religion publickly professed at this day in England is in euery Article and branch thereof, agreeable to the Scripture: therefore it is in euery Article and branch thereof, true, holy, ancient, Catholicke, and Apostolicke. Moreouer, where the Gospel is truely preached, and the holy Sacraments rightly administred, there is a true Christian visible Church: but both these dueties are religiously performed in England: what reason haue you then to say, that we haue no Church?

So we succeed you in your Orders not simply, but so far as they are agreeable to the Scripture: for the man of

Secondly Cranmer and the rest receiued from you a shell of succession without the kernell of Doctrine. For though your Church did giue men power to preach the truth, yet being bewitched with Antichrist, in many things it did not reueale the truth, but when God by the Scriptures reuealed it vnto them, they both preached it themselues and commended it to posterity. Neither was this to leape out of the Church, but out of the corruptions in the Church, euen as the wheate kernel when it is clensed, leapeth not out of the barne, but out of the chaffe. Moreouer though our Doctrine may seeme to you extraordinarie, because it differeth from the Doctrine of the present Church of Rome, yet as our calling and function, so our Doctrine is the same which the spirit of God hath deliuered in holy Scripture, to be ordinary in the Church, till the end of the world, and therefore you haue no reason to require any Miracles at our hands.

                  I will proue that you haue no lawfull ordinarie calling in the3. Church of England. And first you challenge to your selues no other ministers, but either Bishops or Priests or Deacons, for other inferiour orders you haue none. But neither your Bishops, nor your Priestes, nor your Deacons, haue any lawfull ordinary calling. For first to the ordinarie calling of a Bishop, ordination or consecration is requisite by precedent Bishops hauing episcopal power of order and iurisdiction; but your Bishops are descended from such progenitours as had neither of these; no Episcopall power of Order, because either they had no consecration at all, or at least such as is not able to abide the touchstone; no Episcopall iurisdiction, because they are neither elected nor confirmed by our holy Father the successour of Peter, to whom onely Christ gaue the Keyes, and in them the fulnesse of all Ecclesiasticall power. Therefore your Bishops are no Bishops, and consequently all ordinations deriued from them are mere nullities.
                  SEcondly your ordination of Priestes is most intollerable: for according4. to holy Church this sacred action consisteth of two parts answerable to the two principal functions of Priesthood: the former is garnished with these seemely ceremonies. First of all the Bishop with all the Priestes present Catechis. Triden de Ordin. sacram.

This is the first part of the ordination, which graceth him with the principall function of Priesthood, whereby he is made Catechis. ibi.

This is that which maketh the holy Priesthood to be honoured, because no King nor Emperor, no Angel nor Archangel is able to do as we doe; that is, with pronouncing of a few words to make the body of Christ, flesh, blood, and bone, as it was borne of the Virgin Mary. Moreouer after Masse the Bishop

This is the second part, wherein hee receiueth the second function of Priesthood, that is, the power of absolution. Such are the rites of holy Church, wherein you are notoriously defectiue. To passe ouer with silence your contempt of the sacred ceremonies, of Crossing and anointing, which are but accidentall, you want the very essentiall and substantiall parts of Priesthood. For your Church giueth no authoritie to offer the soueraigne sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ; and though you haue a kind of absolution, yet to small purpose. For you neither vse auricular confession, nor sufficient inioyning of pennance, nor satisfaction for sinne, but haue turned the true iudiciall absolution into a declaratory.
                  
                     LAst of all your Deacons are no Deacons, not onely because your Bishops5 haue no authoritie to ordaine, but also because they are defectiue in the maine point of their function: for though the Bishops say, The forme of consecrating Bishops, Priestes and Deacons. 
                     Take thou authoritie to execute the office of a Deacon, yet he meaneth nothing lesse: for the chiefe office of a Deacon is to Diaconorum erat sacerdoti sacrificanti assistere, &c. Bell. de cler. c. 13. assist the Priest in saying of Masse, which you scorne and contemne. By this it appeareth that you haue not one Bishop, one Priest, one Deacon in all the Church of England, that hath a lawfull ordinarie vocation: therefore your pretended Ministers are meerely lay men.

How foule (saith hee) was then the face of the holy Romane Church, when most potent and withall most filthie harlots did beare all the sway at Rome? at whose lust Sees were changed, Bishops appointed, and (which is horrible to be heard and not to bee vttered) whose louers the false Popes, were thrust into the seate of Peter, which were not to bee written in the Catalogue of the Romane Bishops, but onely for the noting of the times: for who may say, they were lawfull Popes which were thus without right thrust in by such strumpets? No where wee finde any mention of Clergie choosing, or giuing consent afterward; All Canons were put to silence; the pontificall decrees were choked, ancient traditions proscribed, and the old customes, sacredrite, and former vse in choosing the high Bishop vtterly extinguished.

For as leaden and soft rules doe not direct the building with an equall tenour, but are bowed to the building at the lust of the builders: so are the Popes Canons made flexible as leade and waxe, that now this great while the Decrees of our ancestours, and the Popes Canons, serue not to guide mens manners, but (that I may so say) to make a banke and get mony.

But because you accuse the Church of England for breaking the Canons in making of Bishops; I answere first, that the consecration of our Bishops is most canonicall: Secondly, that if wee failed in this or that Canon, yet euery transgression of an Ecclesiasticall Canon doth not make a nullitie in a consecration: As for example, It was prouided by the great Conc.

                  HEre arise two questions; the former, whether three Bishops3. be required of necessitie to an Episcopall consecration; the later, whether the Bishops of England be consecrated by three. Now that the state of the former may be the clearer, giue me leaue to aske you a few things. And first, what say you to Amphilochius, who was created Bishop not by men but by Angels, vnlesse Lib. 11. c. 20 
                     Nicephorus delude vs with fables?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  It seemeth to bee no fable, but a true Story. For Amphilochius was allowed for a lawfull Bishop, but this was done (as Cardinall Bell. de sacram. in gen. l. 1. c. 24. 
                     Bellarmine saith) by diuine dispensation extraordinary.

                  What say you then to the blessed Apostles? were they Bishops or no? And if Bishops, whether in that they were Apostles, or by distinct consecration? and if by distinct consecration, by whom were they consecrated?

                     Turrecremata teacheth, that Chirst himselfe made Peter a Bishoppe immediatelie, and Peter ordained the rest, first Iohn, next Iames, then others. And Cardinall Bell. de R. Pont. l. 1. c. 23. 
                     Bellarmine maketh it the two and twentith prerogatiue of Peter, Quòd solus Petrus a Christo ordinatus Episcopus fuerit, caeteri autem a Petro Episcopalem consecrationem acceperint, i. That onely Peter was ordained Bishop by Christ, and the rest receiued their Episcopall consecration from Peter.

                  These conceites and fancies when they shalbe weighed in the ballance, wilbe found too light. In the meane time, what say you to the consecration of Iohn and Iames, were they sound and Canonical?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  They were sound no doubt, but why should you aske if they were canonicall, seeing the Canon was not then made? You must vnderstand, that there is one consideration to bee had of the Church when it is in the cradle, and another, when it is growne to ripe and florishing yeeres. In the infancie of the Church, when Christ ascending into glorie had consecrated Peter, and made him the spring and fountaine of all Episcopall Order, it was necessarie that the first should bee consecrated by Peter alone, the next by two at the most, and these consecrations were sound and sufficient: but when Iames the brother of our Lord was ordained Bishoppe of Ierusalem by Peter, Iohn and the other Iames, they gaue a Forme or Patterne to their successours, as Anacl. ep. 2. c. 1. apud Bin. tom. 1. p. 101. 
                     Anacletus declareth that a Bishop should by no meanes bee consecrated by fewer then by three, all the rest giuing their consent.

                  Suppose a Church should suffer such desolation (which the Lord forbid) that a Canonicall number of Catholicke Bishops were not to be found, what should then be done in this case of necessitie?

For first of all this is the generall iugdement of the Iurists, as appeareth by those words of Cardinall Ioh. Turr. in Grat. decr. tom. 1. p. 492.

Which iudgement of the Iurists preuaileth with most eminent Canonists, as appeareth by the words following in the Cardinall: Vnde Hugo & Archidiaconus dicunt, vt Papa solus cum vno Episcopo non posset consecrare hac forma durante, that is, whereupon Hugo and the Archdeacon say that the Pope alone with one Bishop cannot consecrate, so long as this forme endureth.

                     from which an insoluble argument is taken in this manner. A Church cannot be without Bishops, as we haue declared: among the Lutherans there are no Bishops, for they haue no ordination, nor succession from the Apostles: therefore among them there is no Church, And verely that neither Luther who was accounted Bishop of Wittenberge, nor Zuinglius, who was reputed Bishop of Tigur, nor Oecolampadius, who in the very Epitaph vpon his graue is called the first Bishop of Basill, nor Caluin, who was called the first Bishop of Geneua, nor any other of them were ordeined of three Bishops, nor of one by dispensation with the assistance of Abbots is a thing notoriously knowen; neither do they deny it. Therefore these are no Bishops, at least in the iudgement of the Fathers of the Nicen and Carthaginian Councell, yea in the iudgement of the Apostles themselues, who haue decreed that a Bishop ought to be ordained by three Bishops. Thus Bellarmine is clearely of opinion that a Bishop must either be ordained of three, or haue assistance of Abbots with a dispensation, or else he is no Bishop, and this argument he calleth insoluble.

But be they rich or poore, surely if the Pope might haue had his will, before this time he would haue made them poore ynough. In the daies of King Henry the eight when a view was taken, it appeared that he had receiued out of England onely for Inuestitures of Bishops, Antiq. Brit. pag. 326. 4000. pounds by the yeere, one yeere with another, and that for 40. yeeres together. But how dare Bellarmine thus accuse our Bishops, as though they had nothing belonging to the Episcopall function? What? no learning? none at all? It is not long agoe since he put off his Cardinals robes, disguising himselfe vnder the ill fauoured habit and vizard of Tortus, when one of our Bishops, (whether learned or no, let the world iudge) did so vnmaske and display him, that all Popish hearts haue cause to bleed, to see the weakenesse of their chiefe Champion so plainely discouered. And as our Bishops haue learning, so let the Cardinall know, that they are famous and eminent Preachers, very labourious in the Vineyard of Christ, and in this respect farre vnlike to his brethren the Cardinals.

In the meane time this onely I say; In lying and slandering, many Papists haue had an admirable dexteritie, but Sanders surmounted them all. For as his booke of Schisme is truely called by a learned Bishop, Tort. Torti. p. 363. 
                     Sterquilinium mendactorum, A dunghill of lies; so it might be iustly termed Sterquilinium calumniarum, A very dunghill of slanders, Insomuch that for his noble facultie that way, he deserueth no more to be called M.

                  I will proceed and prosecute an vnanswerable Argument. Euery true Bishop must of necessitie be Consecrated by 3. Bishops at the least; But the Bishops of England are not so: therefore the Bishops of England are no true Bishops.
               
               
                  
                  ORTHOD.
                  The Bishops of England are so, as in due place shall appeare; And if in case of necessity they were not so, What then? The presence of 3. is required onely to the well-being, not simply to the being. It is no essentiall part of Episcopall Consecration, but an accidentall ornament, a comely complement of singular conueniencie, no substantiall point of absolute necessitie.

                  If those Canons were made by the Apostles, then the Church of Rome is much to blame, for the 84. Canon alloweth the 3. Booke of Maccabecs, as also 2. Epistles of Clemens, and his eight bookes of constitutions, for Canonicall Scripture, which the Church of Rome reiecteth: againe, it omitteth the Sonne of Sidrach, Wisdome, and diuers others which your Church imbraceth for Canonicall.

                     Gelasius, who in a councell at Rome of 70. Bishops, saith, Liber Canonum Apostolorum Apocryphus, the booke of the Canon of the Apostles is Apocryphall. And in what sence he called it Apocryphall, is expounded by Bellarmine: 
                     De verbo Dom. l. 1. c. 20. 
                     Eos libros vocat Apocryphos qui sunt aediti ab auctoribus haereticis vel certè suspectis: Gelasius calleth those bookes Apocryphall, which were set out by such authors as were either hereticall, or at least suspected.

                  Not so, for the Canon meaneth that there should be two or three assistants, besides the Metropolitane, as is declared by Cardinall Bell. de eccl. l. 4. c. 8.

If this authority bee of credit, then you are confuted, for it alloweth consecration by one in case of necessity.

                  Heere are two things to bee considered, the ordination of Iames, and the collection thereupon. Concerning the ordination, your Anacletus and Anicetus affirme, that hee was ordained Bishop of Ierusalem by three Apostles, and the same is auouched by Euseb. hist. Eccl. l. 2. c. 1 
                     Eusebius, 
                     Hier. de viris illustribus in Iacobo. 
                     Hierome and others. But what is meant when it is said that the Apostles ordained him?
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  What else but that they conferred vpon him the Episcopall power, as our Bishops doe when they consecrate a Bishop?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Then belike, before this ordination, Saint Iames had not the Episcopall power.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Very true.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Was not he an Apostle of Iesus Christ?
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Yes: for they speake distinctly of Iames the brother of our Lord, of whom Saint Gal. 1. 19. 
                     Paul saith, None other of the Apostles saw I saue Iames, the brother of our Lord: so it is euident that hee was an Apostle.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  And was he not called to the office of an Apostle immediatly by Iesus Christ? & consequētly had he not from him al Apostolick authority?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  All Apostolick I grant: but we speake of Episcopal.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  As though all Episcopall authority were not comprehended in the Apostolick. For what commission can be more ample then this which Christ gaue ioyntly to all his Apostles? As 
                     Io. 20. 21 
                     my Father sent mee, so send I you: and Saint 2. Cor. 12. 12. 
                     Paul proclaimeth that hee was in nothing inferiour to the chiefe Apostles. If in nothing; then not in Episcopall power and authority.

This is agreeable to the iudgement of the best learned among you. Bellarmine saith, Bell. de sacr. bapt. & confir. l. 2. c. 12. 
                     Obseruandum est in Apostolica authoritate contineri omnem Ecclesiasticam potestatem, i.

Wherefore to say, That Christ made Peter Bishop with his owne hands, and that the rest deriued Episcopall power from Peter, is a mere fancie.

                  They say so, And in so saying, they say truely if they be rightly vnderstood. For 1. The Scripture saith of Iudas, 
                     Acts. 1. 20. 
                     His Bishopricke let an other man take, That is, his Apostleship. If the Apostleship may be called a Bishoprick, then an Apostle may be called a Bishop. 2. The word Bishop signifieth an Ouerseer, and may most aptly be applied to the Apostles, which were the chiefe ouerseers of the Church of Christ.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Euery Apostle, in that he is an Apostle, may be called a Bishop in this generall sence; But Iames being an Apostle, was properly made a Bishop in the vsuall Ecclesiasticall sence.

                  A Bishop in the Ecclesiasticall sence hath two properties; For 1. hereceiueth his Episcopall power by imposition of hands. 2. For the execution thereof hee is confined to a certaine place. Neither of which can properly be applied to an Apostle. For though the Apostles made their chiefe abode in great Cities and populous places, as namely Iames at Ierusalem, yet because their Commission extended to all Nations, they could not be so tied to any one place, as the Bishop was; Which is well expressed by Haeres. 27. 
                     Epiphanius, saying, The Apostles went often to other countreis to preach the Gospel, and the Citte of Rome might not be without a Bishop. As though he should say, The Apostles were to preach to all Nations: but the Bishops duetie did confine him to his owne charge▪ This is correspondent to the Scripture, which calleth the Apostles, Matt. 5. 14.

And though the Apostles while they stayed in those Cities did preach, ordeine Ministers, execute Censures, and all other things which are now performed by the Bishops, who succeed them in the gouernement of the Church, (in regard whereof the fathers call them the Bishops of those places,) yet their Episcopall power was not distinct from their Apostolicke, but included in it as a branch thereof: not deriued from any Ordination by the hands of man, but giuen them immediatly by Iesus Christ.

                     Either say, that these 3. did Consecrate him onely with visible Vnction, but he was before Annointed of the Lord after an innisible maner: Or say, they did not ordeine him,
                     
                     but onely shewed a forme of ordaining vnto others: Or say that they ordained him not to be a Bishop, but an Archbishop: Or say that they ordained, that is Inthronised him to the administration of a certaine place; for before he was a Bishop without a title. Hitherto the Glosse. And verily as the Prophets and teachers at Antioch, imposed hands, with fasting and prayer vpon 
                     Acts. 13. 2▪ 3. 
                     Paul and Barnabas, not to giue them any new Ecclesiasticall power; for that is more then wee finde in the Scripture: but as the Text saith, To set them apart for the worke whereunto the Lord had called them; So the Apostles might impose hands vpon Iames, not to giue him any Episcopall power, (that fancie hath bene before confuted,) but by common consent, to designe him to the gouernement of the Church of Ierusalem, and to commend him and his labours to the grace of God: which imposition of hands the ancient writers terme Ordination, vsing the word largely, and improperly. But if we should imagine that he was properly ordained, what can be collected thereupon?

                  There may be a faire patterne, and yet posteritie may sometimes want meanes to imitate that patterne.

Wherefore in the iudgment of Hugo, the Ordination is not void in respect of the power, but the Church may make it void, in respect of the execution: and yet vpon his repentance he may be admitted to the execution, not by a new ordination, but by dispensation,

which proueth that the transgression was not substantial, but accidental.

Wherefore whatsoeuer they shall doe amongst Bishops, Necesse est vt irritum fiat: i.

                  Your owne Turr. Cr. quo supra. Cardinall shall answere you; Wheresoeuer (saith hee) it can bee found that an ordination is voide and of no validitie, because it is performed by fewer then by three, it is to be vnderstood, Non quantum ad veritatem Sacramenti, sed quantum ad executionem officij▪ i. Not in respect of the trueth of the Sacrament, but in respect of the execution of the office. And truely there is no reason that he should inioy an honorable office in the Church, which presumptuously breaketh the Lawes of the Church. Therefore the Church may iustly repell them from execution; but cannot take away their power which they haue in themselues, and haue power to imprint in others. Yet while they haue it without the Churches approbation, they cannot giue it with the Churches approbation: and while they stand in opposition, the Church esteemeth the orders they giue as no orders, yet are they true orders in the nature of the thing, but the Church restraineth the execution of them, as though they were none, for order and discipline sake. Yet as you heard before euen in case of presumption, the Church may dispense vpon due consideration, and consequently receiue into her bosome, such as were ordained in Schisme, and let them inioy both their orders and honours. But when the defect springeth neither from schisme, nor heresie, from presumption, nor singularitie, but onely from vrgent necessitie, there being no voluntary violation, necessitie it selfe is a sufficient dispensation.

                  ORTHO.
                  Indeed a vaine Campian rat. 4. Iesuite cryeth: Concilia generalia mea sunt: primum, vltimum media, that is, All generall Councells are mine, the first, the last, and the middle. For tryall whereof let vs take a little viewe of this Nicen Councell, wherein you so glory: and first concerning that very Canon which you produce against vs, as though we did transgresse it, we may iustly say, that the Church of England hath as well obserued it, as euer did any Church vpon

the face of the earth: But the Church of Rome doth indeed transgresse it, In which sometimes one Bishop alone doth consecrate a Bishop, two Abbots supplying the place of the other two Bishops, as Bell. de eccl. milit. l. 4. c. 8. 
                     Bellarmine confesseth. Secondly, according to the Nicen Canons, the power to confirme Bishops, belongeth to the Canon. 4. 
                     Metropolitan of the prouince, without whose approbation whosoeuer is ordeined a Bishop, the Nicen Fathers account for no Bishop▪ but the Church of Rome alloweth him whom the Pope alloweth, though he be not allowed by his Metropolitan, and disalloweth him whom the Pope disalloweth, though he be lawfully allowed by his Metropolitan. Thirdly, the Nicen Canon 5. Canons forbidde that any Bishop should absolue them, which are excommunicate by another Bishop. But the Pope will open and shut, bind and loose at his pleasure. Fourthly the Nicen Canons appoint that old 
                     Canon 6. 
                     customes should bee kept, and namely that the Bishop of Alexandria should haue the preheminence in Egypt, Lybya and Pentapolis, because such also is the custome of the Bishop of Rome: and likewise that in Antioch, and other Prouinces the Churches should inioy their dignities and prerogatiues. Which words in all reason import, that euery Metropolitan should haue preheminence within his own Prouince, according to the custome of Rome, which custome they commend and propose for a patterne: But the Bishop of Rome careth neither for Canons nor Customes which make against him. He is not content to bee Bishop in his owne Diocesse, and Metropolitan ouer Bishops in his owne Prouince, and Patriarch ouer his owne Metropolitans: but he would stretch out the pawes of his Supremacie ouer the Christian world. Fiftly the Nicen Canons would haue no Priest made without 
                     Canon 9. 
                     examination, and such as are rashly ordained they doe not allow: But the Bishop of Rome maketh Ordines autem etiam maiores, etiam presbyteratum posse conferri infantibus nondum vsum rationis habentibus est Communis doctrin

                     Ferdinandus Medices a Florentine was made a Cardinall by Sixtus Quintus, when he was not ful thirteene yeres old: and Iohannes Medices which was afterwards Pope Leo the tenth, was Cardinall before he was fourteene yeeres complet, yet he was an Archbishop fiue yeeres before he was Cardinall. And least you should imagine that this fauour was afforded only to Florentines, Odettus Castilioneus was Cardinall at eleuen yeere old, yet he was elected Bishop before he was Cardinall. Alphonsus sonne to Immanuel King of Portugall was Cardinall at seuen yeeres old; and yet he was Bishop before he was Cardinall. These are the men, whose office is, to chuse the Pope, to assist him with their Counsell, and to sit with him as Iudges of the whole world. And that which is more wonderfull, if we may beleeue Glaber Rodulphus, a Monke of your owne, which liued at the same time; Benedict the ninth was made Pope at twelue yeeres olde: Was not this a fitte man to be Father of the Church, Moderator of generall Councels, Decider of all Controuersies, Expounder of all Scriptures, the onely Oracle vpon the face of the earth, and Iudge Paramount of the Christian World? Sixtly the Nicen Canon 18. Canons doe not suffer a Deacon so much as to sit amongst Priests, but as the Priest was in place, inferiour to the Bishop, so the Deacon to the Priest. Now though it were granted to be true which De cler. c. 16. 
                     Bellarmine affirmeth, that vnder Syluester there was seuen Cardinal Deacons in Rome, yet the Nicen Councel maketh no exception at all of Cardinals. But be he Cardinal or not Cardinall, the Deacon is inferior to the Priest, and the Priest to the Bishop; but the Bishop of Rome hath aduanced his Cardinals, euen such as are neither Bishops nor Priests.

First aboue Bishops, then aboue Archbishops, last of all aboue Patriarches. Seuenthly, the Nicen Can. 17. Canons forbid any Bishop to ordaine in his Church a Clerke belonging to another Bishop, without the consent of the Bishop to whom he belongeth. But the Bishop of Rome ordaineth, whomsoeuer, wheresoeuer, whensoeuer; not expecting the consent of any man. Last of all the Nicen Can. 18. Canons forbid all Clerkes to follow filthy lucre: Wherein how his holines excelleth, is plainely platted out by Claudius 
                     In Tit. c. 1. 
                     Espencaeus, a Diuine of your owne, out of a shamelesse booke openly sold in Rome, called the Taxe of the Chamber, or Chauncery Apostolicke, wherein a man may learne before hand, at what price to be dispensed withall, for any villany he shall commit, be it adultery, symony, periurie, incest, or worse then incest. Wherefore Philodox, if paper could blush, I am perswaded the leaues of that booke would be as red as scarlet. So at Rome nothing is forbidden, but to come without money; if a man bring money, it will procure a dispensation for any thing: A wedge of gold findeth g

                     ace wheresoeuer it goeth, and a Key of gold can open Saint Peters locke. For all things are weighed at Rome in a ballance of golde, as though pouerty were the onely irregularitie, and no sinne in the world were greater then to want money, so well doth the Church of Rome obserue the Nicen Canons. But let vs heare the words of the Canon.

                     if this be hard to performe either by occasion of vrgent necessitie, or for the length of the iourney, yet surely three ought to bee congregated into one place, so that they haue the consent of the absent, & solet thē make an ordination. Likewise the fourth C. 2. apud. Bin. t. 1. p. 553. Councell of Carthage; when a Bishop is ordained, let two Bishops lay the Booke of the Gospels, and hold it ouer his head and necke, and one Bishop powring the blessing vpon him, let all other Bishops that are present, touch his head with their handes. Likewise the second Cap. 5. apud. Bin. t. 1. p. 537. Councell of Arles. Let no Bishop presume to ordaine a Bishop without permission of the Metropolitane, nor any Bishop being a Metropolitance without three Bishops of the same Prouince, so that others of the same Prouince be admonished by Epistles, that they may signifie by their answere, that they haue consented. So the sixt 
                     Cap. 4. Bin. t. 1. p. 617. 
                     Councell of Carthage: A Bishop must be ordained of all the Bishops which are within the Prouince, but if this bee hard either for vrgent necessitie, or for the length of the iourney, yet by all meanes three meeting together, there may bee imposition of handes, the absent Bishoppes consenting thereto by writing. So the second Councell at Cap. 2. Bin. t. 2. p. 669. 
                     Brachar; It is meete that Bishops should bee appointed, especially by the whole Councell: but if this shalbe hard in respect of necessitie, or for the length of the iourney, let three of them bee gathered together, and let the subscriptions of all both present and absent bee taken, and so afterward let the ordination be performed. Thus you see the Councels, and namely the Nicen requireth the presence of three. For first it should bee performed by all the Bishops of the Prouince, but if that cannot be by reason of vrgent necessitie, yet surely three must bee congregated: so they make it not a thing indifferent, but a matter of necessitie, and in any case require three.

                  But the Nicen Canon not content with three present, requireth also the consent of the absent in the same strictnesse of wordes, Yet surely let three be congregated into one place, so that they haue also the consent of the absent, and so let them make an ordination. Wherefore if you expound the one branch as a point of cōgru
                        •
                     ty, why do you vrge the other as of absolute necessitie? Againe these Councels were holden, Florente Ecclesia, when the world was furnished with plentie of godly Bishops, but you vrge them against a Church lately eclipsed and newly recouered from darkenesse, the world round about being drowned in superstition and Idolatry. These answeres might bee sufficient; but for your better satisfaction, let vs search the sence of your authorities, by comparing them one with another. The first was a Canon ascribed to the Apostles, which being made when Bishops were scant, requireth two or three. The second drawne from the decrees of Popes, supposed to be made when the number was somewhat increased, requireth three at the least, and the consent of the rest. So the Nicen Canon being made when the Church flourished, as also the second at Arles, the sixt at Carthage, and the second at Brachar, besides three present requireth the consent of the absent: but the fourth Councell of Carthage contenteth it selfe with the present, and maketh no mention at all of the absent, wherein it agreeth with the Canon ascribed to the Apostles. Whence commeth this variety? surely the very consideration of time and persons may teach vs, that they thought it a thing in it selfe indifferent to be disposed by the discretion of the Church in sundry maners, as sundry occasions and occurrences did leade them. This exposition runneth gently, and all things doe sweetely agree; but if wee followe your rigorous interpretation, then your witnesses crosse and discredit one another. For your Anacletus requireth three at the least, so doe the Councels alledged; but doe they require them of simple necessitie? if it be so, then hee is no Bishop which is ordained by fewer then by three. But the Canons of the Apostles allow him for a Bishop which is Consecrated by two. Againe, the Nicen Fathers, and others by you alledged, require the consent of the absent, which is not required by the fourth Councell of Carthage, nor by the Canon ascribed to the Apostles. By this it appeareth that reuerend antiquitie did iudge these things to bee onely matters of conueniencie, and not of simple and absolute necessitie. And being of this nature, they are subiect to alteration in case of necessity. Neither is this to despise the Commandements of the Church, but to yeeld to the countermand of the great tyrant necessitie.

                  Thus I dispute. Timothy was consecrated Bishop by imposition of hands of the Presbytery: But this Presbytery was an assembly of Presbyters: Therefore Timothy was consecrated by an assembly of Presbyters: Now those Presbyters were not inferiour Priestes, but Bishops, as appeareth by In hunc locū. 
                     Chrysostome, Theophylact, and Oecumenius: therefore Timothy was consecrated

by an assembly of Bishops. But an assembly of Bishops must needes be three at the least. Therefore Timothy was consecrated Bishop by three Bishops at the least. Now this consecration of Timothy should bee a necessary and perpetuall patterne inuiolable, and vnchangeable to all posterities. Therefore all Bishops must of necessitie be consecrated, by three Bishops at the least, which was to be proued.

                     S. Paul in this place, exhorteth Timothy to be diligent in his Calling by three Arguments: First, because in his Ordination he had receiued Grace; that is, Not onely the gracious gift, that he should be Pastour of the Church of Ephesus, but also the graces of the Spirit to furnish him for the execution of that holy Calling. Secondly, because he was designed and pointed out to this Sacred function, by the Spirit of Prophecie. Thirdly, because he was ordained by the imposition of the hands of the Presbyterie. What this Presbyterie was, I will not take vpon mee to decide and determine; It shall be sufficient so farre to discouer the weakenesse of your Argument, that it may appeare, that you cannot hence conclude your purpose by any sound consequence. For what thinke you did S. Paul meane by Presbyterie, when hee exhorted Timothy not to neglect the Grace which was in him by the imposition of the hands of the Presbyterie?

                  ORTHOD.
                  You need not feare. For it is cleare that the Presbyterie here mentioned, ordained Timothy, by imposition of hands, which no Lay-man may doe: therefore doubtlesse they were no Lay-men. But what in your iudgement is meant by Presbyterie?

If this bee true, then your argument is shaken in pe

                     ces. For that may bee said to bee performed by the order or office of Priest-hood, which is done

by one Priest onely as well as though it were done by a thousand, and this interpretation may seeme to bee countenanced by conference of Scripture, because Paul though an Apostle, yet according to the phrase of Scripture may bee Called a Presbyter: for this word Presbyter in the New Testament taken for an Ecclesiasticall person, doth signifie sometimes the Pastour of a particular flocke, as when Paul willeth Titus to 
                     Titu. 1. 5. 
                     ordaine Presbyters in euery Citie; sometimes it is taken more generally and extendeth euen to the Apostles themselues: so Iohn calleth himselfe a 2. Ioh. v. 1. & 3. Ioh. v. 1. 
                     Presbyter, and Peter speaking to Presbyters calleth himselfe 1. Pet. 5. 1. 
                     their fellow Presbyter: Whence wee may conclude by analogie, that Paul also may bee called a Presbyter. Now it is certaine that Saint Paul imposed hands vpon Timothie. For hee saith, 2. Tim. 1. 6. 
                     I put thee in remembrance that thou stir vp the gift of God, which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands. Wherefore seeing the word Presbyterie may signifie the office of a Presbyter, and Saint Paul may bee called a Presbyter, and it is euident that Timothie was ordained by the hands of Paul; therefore it is possible, that when the Scripture ascribeth his ordination to the Presbyterie, it may bee meant that hee was made only by the hands of Paul, which is the opinion of Dionysius Carthusianus, who saith, manuū Presbyterij, id est, manuū mearū qui te ordinaui Episcopum. Of the hands of the Presbytery, that is, of my hands which ordained thee a Bishop. But suppose that Presbyterie in this place signifie a company or assembly of Bishops, as Chrysostome Theophylact and Oecumenius interpret it; How many will you iudge to make an assembly?

                     Bellarmines imagination, that an assembly of Bishops imposed hands together with the ordainer, it will follow, that Timothie was consecrated by foure: therefore if you make this example a perpetuall patterne, then all Bishops must be consecrated by foure, which is against your selfe.

                     Bellarmine abuseth his Reader: for to beginne with Chrysostome, he saith, Hee speaketh not of Presbyters in this place, but of Bishops, for Presbyters ordained him not a Bishop. And Theophylact, with imposition of hands of the Presbyterie, that is of Bishops; for Presbyters did not ordaine a Bishop. Likewise Occumenius, by Presbyters hee meaneth Bishops, for Presbyters were not to impose hands vpon a Bishop. So these fathers by Presbyterie, vnderstood Bishops; the number they doe not define, neither doe they affirme that there was an assembly besides the principall consecrator. But concerning the number you shall heare the iudgement of your Angelicall Doctor, who bringeth two readings of this place. Presbyteri and Presbyterij, and handling the first, hee demaundeth, Why

                     it should bee said, Presbyteri in the singular number, seeing a Bishop should bee consecrated by three: to this hee frameth two answers. First because, though many meete together, yet one is principall, the rest conssistants. Secondly yet (saith hee) it may bee said, that this Canon was not then made, and that then there were but few Bishops, which could not bee congregated. So hee

thinketh it probable, that Timothy was not consecrated by three. Whereto agreeth Cardinall Ioh. de Turrecr. in Gratian

And as they were ministring to our Lord and fasting, the holy Ghost said, Separate me Saul and Barnabas vnto the worke whereto I haue called them. Then they fasting and praying, and imposing hands vpon them dismissed them. Behold, not onely Barnabas, but also Saul, that is, Paul the Apostle was consecrated Bishop, & that by three Bishops, Simeon, Lucius and Manahen. Though he were an Apostle, not of men, nor by men, yet, it was the will of God that hee should bee ordained Bishop by 3. Bishops, that the discipline of the Church might be obserued.

                  These are doting dreames not worth the answering. For seeing the text faith only, that there were in the Church which was at Antioch Prophets and Doctors, among whom were Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Manahen and Saul, why should not we thinke Barnabas to be called a Prophet as well as Simeon, Lucius and Manahen, seeing hee is first named? A point so cleere that it is confessed by 
                        Ior. in Act. 13. v. 1. 
                     Lorinus the Iesuite, ascribing the titles of Prophets and Doctors as well to Saul and Barnabas, as to the rest. If these Prophets were Bishops as Turrian imagineth, then it will follow that Barnabas was a Bishop before they laid hands vpon him. And consequently, that he was reordeined, which is absurd. Moreouer as it cannot bee proued, that those three were Bishops, so it is certaine that they did not ordaine Paul and Barnabas Bishops. For Paul being an Apostle could not receiue any Episcopal grace from man, as hath been declared. Wherefore this imposition of hands was not to giue them any new power, but as the text saith, To set 
                     Vers. 2. 
                     them apart for the worke, wherevnto the Lord had called them, which when they had fulfilled, they sayled backe to Antioch, whence they had beene

                  That the presence of three Bishops is not required of absolute necessitie.
               
               
                  
                     NOw, that it is no substantiall point of absolute necessitie may be concluded out of your owne positions and practise. For the declaration whereof, first I demaund, whether Episcopall consecration be a Sacrament or no?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  That Ordination is a Sacrament truely and properly, is rightly defined by the Councel of Sess. 22. can. 3. 
                     Trent. For there are three things onely required to a Sacrament, as your selues confesse, an externall signe, a promise of grace, and a commandement, or diuine institution: All which are found in ordination as our learned Bel. de sacr. ord. c. 2. Cardinall hath proued out of the Scripture; Ibidem. c. 5. who hath also declared, that those Scriptures whereby Catholickes doe prooue Ordination to bee a Sacrament are vnderstood of Episcopall Ordination. Whereupon he affirmeth, that if Episcopall Ordination bee not a Sacrament, wee cannot proue euidently out of the Scriptures, that Ordination is a Sacrament.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  If the word Sacrament bee taken somewhat largely, for any externall signe instituted of God; whereto is annexed a promise of grace, then wee will grant with Saint Contra. epist. Parm. l. 2. c. 13. 
                     Austine, that Order may bee called a Sacrament: but if it bee taken strictly for such a signe as is Rom. 4. 11. 
                     a seale of the righteousnesse of faith, whereto is annexed a promise of the grace of Iustification and Remission of sinnes: in which sense Baptisme and the Lords Supper are Sacraments, then wee may not admit it for a Sacrament. For in Baptisme and the Lords Supper, the sauing grace of Iustification and Act. 2. 38. Remission of sinnes is signified, sealed, and exhibited, to the worthy receiuer; but the grace giuen in Ordination is of another nature, respecting not so much the good of the receiuer as of the flocke, for which hee receiueth it. For the Ministers of the Gospell are salt to season others, candles to shine vnto others, pipes and conduits to conueigh the water of life vnto others. But did you not say, that though three Bishops were ordinarily required to the Consecration of a Bishop, yet the Pope might dispense with two of the three?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  I said so out of Cardinall Bellarmine and Binius.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  What authoritie hath the Pope to dispense in Sacraments?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  That may appeare by the Councell of Sess. 21. c. 2. 
                     Trent. Moreouer, the holy Synod declareth, that this power hath alwayes beene in the Church, that in the Dispensation of Sacraments it might appoint or change such things as it should iudge to bee most expedient for the profit of the receiuers, or the reuerence of the Sacraments themselues, according to the varietie of things, times, and places, Salua illorum substantia, so the substance of the Sacraments be preserued. Whereby it appeareth that the Pope can dispense onely with circumstances and not with substance.
               
               
                  
                  ORTHOD.
                  Why then did the Church of Rome dispense with the Sess. 21. Can. 2. 
                     Cuppe in the Communion? Can you take away one halfe not diminishing the substance? But to let this passe, doe you not marke the conclusion which floweth from your premises? If Episcopall Consecration bee a Sacrament, and the Pope may not dispense with the Substance of a Sacrament, and yet hee may dispense with two of the three Bishops required in a Consecration; then it followeth, that two of the three are not of the Substance of Consecration. Secondly, your owne present practise doeth proue the same. For you professe that in your Church sometimes, one 
                     Bell. de eccles. milit. l. 4. c. 8. quantum ad. 
                     Bishop alone assisted with two mitred Abbots doth performe it. If this bee sufficient, then three Bishops are not required of absolute necessitie. Now let vs a little looke backe to former times, and consider the iudgement of better ages.
                  I Will beginne with the fourth Conc. Carth. 4. c. 2. Bin. t. 1. pag. 553. Councell of Carthage, and the very2 place which you your selfe alleadged, wherein are prescribed the offices to bee performed by the Bishops, when one is to bee consecrated, to wit, how two should holde the Booke of the Gospels ouer his head, one powre out the blessing, (that is, pronounce the words, whereby the spirituall power, grace, and blessing is giuen,) and all the rest touch his heade with their hands. When one alone pronounceth the wordes, thenone alone ordaineth. For the wordes are confessed on all sides, to bee the very essentiall forme of Ordination. This is agreeable to the collection of your owne Turrec. in Gratian. p. 493. Cardinall, Tenent librum, &c. Ergo videtur quod nihil agatur per illos Episcopos quod sit ad substantiam consecrationis pertinens. Ergo eorum assistentia non pertinet ad substantiam consecrationis, sed magis ad quandam solennitatem. i. They hold the booke, &c. Therefore it seemeth that nothing is done by these two Bishops which is pertaining to the substance of Consecration. Therefore their assistance doth not belong to the substance of the consecration, but rather to a certaine solemnitie.
                  
                  IN the yeere of our Lord 441. there was a Councell holden at Orenge in3 France where it was thus Conc. Auraus. c. 21. Bin. t. 1 pag. 1010. decreed. Duo si presumpserint ordinare Episcopum in nostris Prouincijs, &c. If two presume to ordaine a Bishop in our Prouinces, it pleaseth vs (to decree) concerning those presumptuous persons, that if it shall any where happen that two Bishops shall make a Bishop against his will, the authors being condemned, he which suffred violence, shalbe substituted in the Church of one of them, if his life be answerable; and that another neuerthelesse be ordeined in the place of the other being cast out: If two shall make a Bishop with his consent, then he also shall be condemned, to the end that those things which were instituted by antiquitie, may be obserued more warily▪
                      Here are two Cases: for the ordained was either vnwilling or willing: If vnwilling, he enioyed the Bishopprick, because he was not consenting to the breach of the Canon: If he were willing, then he also was condemned, & put from the Bishopprick, which was not for want of receiuing the Episcopall power; for if two Bishops could confer it to one against his wil, vndoubtedly they could giue it to one that was willing. But the first is confessed by the Councell, in that they allow him, and giue him a Bishoppricke, where he may exercise his Episcopall function, therefore the latter was not then doubted of. But though both had receiued alike power in their ordination, yet the innocent was allowed, & the offender reiected for discipline sake.

In it fifteene Bishops of the Prouince of Lyons, & Marbona meeting after their maner made 29 Canons concerning the lawes and discipline of the Church.

                     Binius saith, When Pelagius had approued the fift Synod, he so greatly offended all the Westerne Bishops, that he could not find sufficient Prelates of which he might be ordained according to the Apostolicall constitution; and so it was necessary that at the Command of Pelagius, a Priest of Ostia (which had neuer happened before) should performe the office in stead of a Bishop. Heere is a cleare confession, that a Bishop of Rome in case of necessitie, was consecrated only by two Bishops and a Priest. And yet it appeareth by the same place of Anastasius, that he ordained in his time 26. Priests, and 49. Bishops. Now if three Bishops be required of absolute necessitie, then there was a nullity in his Consecration, and consequently in all the Consecrations deriued from him, and so there will follow a world of nullities in the Church of Rome: or if there be no nullitie in his Consecration, then you cannot conclude a nullitie for the want of three.
                  HItherto of three, Now I will proue that two are not required of absolute6. necessitie. For Euagrius Patriarch of Antioch, was ordained by Paulinus alone, and yet was allowed for a lawfull Bishop.

For the Canons doe not permit one to chuse his successour; they command that all the Bishops of the Prouince should be assembled: they forbid any man to be created vnlesse three be present, but they not willing to take knowledge of any of these things, admitted the Communion of Euagrius and exasperated the eares of the Emperour against Flauianus.

                     SVppose I should admit, that three Bishops were euerlastingly, and vnchangeably required to the Consecration of a new Bishop, and that of such absolute necessitie, that the defect should make a nullitie: what would this aduantage you, or disaduantage vs?

                  Very much: For then it would follow, that your Bishops are no Bishops.

                  Why so? There is not a Bishop in England at this day liuing, which was not Consecrated by three. Our booke of Consecrating may informe you, That in the Church of England, two Bishops doe alwayes present the person to be Consecrated, and the Archbishop or some other Bishop appointed by his Commission, pronounceth the Blessing, as principall Consecratour. Is not this Canonicall?

For to a Canonicall Bishop it is required, That he haue three such Bishops for his Consecrators, as were euery one of them Consecrated by three: And againe each of them by three; And so by continuall succession, till we come to the Apostles. For as Doct. Stapl. princ. doct. l. 13.

                     Stapleton saith, Christi Ecclesia illa sola est quae suos Pastores & Episcopos perpetua successione potest ostendere. i. That onely is Christs Church which can shew her Pastors and Bishops in a perpetuall succession. And Ibidem. againe, Vbicunque talis perpetu

                         successio, non in eisdem locis sed in eadem legitima, & successiua vocatione, missione, & Ordinatione ostendi potest, ibi sit vera Christi Ecclesia Catholica, id est Ecclesiae Catholicae pars & membrum. i. Wheresoeuer such a perpetuall succession of Pastors can be shewed, not in the same places, but in the same lawfull and successiue vocation, mission, and Ordination, there is a true Catholicke Church; That is, A part and member
                     
                     of the Catholicke Church. 
                     Stapl. fort. par. 2. c. 1. f. 95. Now, If you can shew any succession of Bishops in England, or elsewhere, you can shew it no otherwise, then could the Donatists, of whom Optatus thus writeth, Missus est Victor, &c. Victor was sent of the Donatists to Rome, There was a sonne without a father, a seruant without a ruler, a scholler without a master, a successour without a predecessour. Igitur quia Claudianus, &c. i. Therefore because Claudian seemeth to succeed to Lucian, Lucian to Macrobius, Macrobius to Encolpius, Encolpius to Boniface, Boniface to Victor; If now we should aske Victor in whose place hee sate, and to whom hee succeeded; Hee could not shew any other Chaire or See, but the See and Chaire of pestilence. Thus I say, That as Victor among the Donatists, so Luther among the Protestants of Wittenberge, so Zuinglius among the Sacramentaries of Zurich, so Caluin among those of Geneua, so Bernard Rotman among the Anabaptists, so M. Iewell, Grindall and Horne, and such other false Bishops among vs, haue risen and started vp suddenly without fathers, without predecessours, without masters, in any right and lineall succession; Or if they haue any, let them search their Records, turne their Registers, produce their Euidences, vnfold their Monuments of Antiquitie, and witnesse to the world their Canonicall succession; which they neither doe, nor can doe. But we can shew you Bishops of Rome euen from S. Peter, to our holy father Paulus Quintus, who now liueth. De sacrif. Miss. l. 2. c. 6. 
                     Antonius Democharis hath described the Bishops of France, or rather of all the Prouinces of the Christian world. Stap. princ. doct. l. 13. c. 7. Doct. Stapleton wrote with his owne hand, a Catologue found in a Monasterie, containing the Bishops of all the Westerne Church. Histories, Registers, publique Tables, the very Temples and most ancient Monuments of Ecclesiastical Colledges, are euident Arguments of our succession. Yea we haue a Catalogue in Polydor Virgil, of all the Bishops of our Nation for almost a thousand yeeres. Then was the Church of England like a Golden chaine, whose Sacred linckes had such a mutuall connexion and dependencie, that from the blessed Apostles, we might descend by degrees to the lowest lincke, euen to the last Bishop of England; whence we might returne againe, ascending and climbing vp to the Apostles themselues. But now, alas, since the time of Schisme, in stead of Golden linckes, you haue added leaden: so that there is a breach, a rupture, a plaine dissolution in the chaine. You may well climbe vp a few steps by the leaden ladder, but you must downe againe; you haue no part nor portion in the Golden ladder of succession, which leadeth vs vp to S. Peter, and so to Christ himselfe. For the Church of Rome, and that onely hath Canonicall Bishops; All other are but counterfeit.

Neither haue we diuerted the fountaine, though wee were forced to cut out a chanell to draine it, to straine it, to purge it from your pollutions, that so wee might drinke the water of Life, out of the wells of saluation. Whatsoeuer you haue by lawfull possession, by ancient and iust prescription, by inheritance from the Apostles, whereof you haue sound Record and euidence out of the Scripture, All that is common to vs with you. Whatsoeuer is controuersed betweene vs in any point of Religion, therein we appeale to the written Will and Testament of Christ; Let that be Iudge betweene vs and you.

                  When the question was betweene the Iewes and the Samaritanes concerning the Temple, whether the Lord in his Law allowed that at Ierusalem, or that other in mount Garizin, 
                     Ex Ioseph. antiquit. l. 13. c. 5. 
                     Andronicus produced the succession of the high Priests from Aaron; Whereupon Ptolomeus King of Egypt gaue sentence for the Temple at Ierusalem. What say you, had he not reason?

                  He had: For the Lord gaue the Priesthood onely to Aaron and his sonnes; so they only had title to the Priesthood, who descended from Aaron by carnall generation. But Aaron and his sonnes according to the Law of the Lord, performed the Priests Office in the Tabernacle, and afterward in the Temple at Ierusalem, the place which the Lord had chosen. Wherefore as they alone were the Priests of the Lord: so that alone was the Temple of the Lord.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Very well. Now to proceed▪ We of the Church of Rome are built vpon S. Peter, as it were vpon mount Sion, you are built vpon Cranmer, as it were vpon mount Garizin. We haue a Church and Priesthood, which deriue their originall from Christ; you can goe no further then Cranmer: Now if this matter were put to King Ptolomy, or any other indifferent man, would not he giue iudgement for vs against you?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  No, Neither for your Priesthood, nor for your Church; Not for the first, because the Priesthood which the Apostles conferred, was only a power to minister the word and Sacraments, which being conueied to posteritie successiuely by Ordination, is found at this day in some fort in the Church of Rome, in regard whereof you may be said to succeed the Apostles, and Cranmer you, and wee Cranmer, and consequently we also in this succeed the Apostles as well as you. But besides this, which is the Ordinance of God, you haue added another thing, the imagination of your owne braine, which you esteeme the principall function of Priesthood, to wit, a power to offer a Propitiatorie Sacrifice for the quicke and the dead. Now, how is it possible that in this you should succeed the Apostles, seeing (as in due place shall be prooued) they neither were such Priestes themselues, nor

euer by Ordination deliuered any such Priest-hood? And as Ptolomy if hee liued in this age, could not iustifie your Priestes; so neither could hee nor any indifferent man iustifie your Church by vertue of this Argument drawne from outward succession. For how slender it is, may appeare by consideration of the Greek Church, which Bell. de Eccl. l. 4. c. 8. quòd autem apud Graecos non sit Ecclesia probamus. 
                     Bellarmine denieth to be a Church, pretending That they were conuicted in three full councels of Schisme and heresie; yet Constantinople can fetch her pedegree from Saint Andrew the Apostle, as witnesseth Niceph. l. 8. c. 6. 
                     Nicephorus, and bring it downeward, euen to Ieremie, who 
                     Gen. Chron. l. 4. 
                     liued in this present age. Likewise the Church of Alexandria chalengeth succession, as well and as truely as the Romane. Legat. Eccl. Alexand. apud Bar. annal. tom. 6. in fine. 
                     Baronius recordeth an Ambassage from Gabriell their Patriach, to Clemens the eight, in the title whereof he calleth himselfe, the 97. Patriarch successor of Saint Marke the Euangelist. If you say that the line of Constantinople and Alexandria hath beene interrupted, be it so: And hath not the Romane beene so likewise? Legat. Eccl. Alexand. apud Bar. annal. tom. 6. in fine. 
                     Genebrard is of opinion, that fifty Popes by the space of almost 150. yeeres were not Apostolicall, but Apotacticall and Apostaticall. 
                     Gen. Chron. l. 4. 
                     Baronius lamenteth that false Popes were thrust by strumpets into the seat of Peter. Platina 
                     Bar. anno 912. n. 8. saith, it was grown to that passe that any factious fellow might inuade the seat of Peter. I passe ouerg Plat. in V

                        a Clementis 2. your hereticall Popes, your woman Pope, and your Antipopes, whereof you haue had some times two, some times three at once, so that one could not tell which was the true Pope, but onely by the preuayling faction. For he that wonne it in the field must weare the garland, the weaker side must to the walles; and ambitious wittes must bee set a worke by writing to maintaine the Popes quarrell. Haue you not now great cause to bragge of this noble succession? If you expound your selfe not of Local, and personall, but of such as appeareth in successiue Vocation, Mission and Ordination, then why doe you tell vs of Polydor Virgil, or of Democharis, or of the old monument found in a Monastery, which haue onely set downe the names of such as succeeded such persons, in such places, but haue not described their successiue ordination? & if you could shew vs this also, yet it would not proue the Church of Rome to be a true Catholike Church. For why should wee not thinke that Constantinople, and Alexandria might haue this as well as Rome? Moreouer your owne former example doth confute you. For Sigon. de rep. heb. l. 2. c. 6 
                     Manasses the high Priest of the Temple in mount Garizim was brother to Iaddi the high Priest in Ierusalem, and had the like succession from Aaron, yet the Samaritans were not a true, but schismaticall Church, in regard whereof their Temple was called Ibid. 
                     Templum transgressorum. Finally suppose that into the place of a Catholike and Canonicall Bishop deceased, a capable and Catholike man, were canonically chosen and consecrated; yet it is very possible, that hee may become an heretike, as for example an Arrian, and may draw his flocke after him. Will you now say that this flocke so poysoned with Arrianisme, are the true members of your Catholike Church? Yet here is locall and personall succession, yea euen the golden chaine of successiue ordination. Therefore that assertion of Stapletons, to with, that wheresoeuer this succession is, there is also a true Catholike Church, cannot bee defended; but Bel. de eccl. l. 4. c. 8. 
                     Bellarmine saith farre more truely: It is not necessarily gathered that the Church is alwaies where there is succession. For besides this outward

succession, there must likewise bee the inward succession of doctrine to make a true Church. Lib. 4. 6. 43 
                     Irenaeus describeth those which haue true succession from the Apostles, to bee such as with the succession of the Episcopall office haue receiued the certaine grace of truth. And this kind of succession hee calleth the principall succession; so Gregory 
                     Naz. Orat. 21. 
                     Nazianzen hauing said, that Athanasius succeeded Saint Marke in godlinesse, addeth that this succession in godlinesse is properly to be accounted succession: For hee that holdeth the same Doctrine is also partaker of the same throne, but he that is against the Doctrine, must bee reputed an aduersary, euen while hee sitteth in the throne, for the latter hath the name of succession, but the former hath the thing it selfe and the truth. Therefore you must proue your succession in doctrine, otherwise you must bee holden for aduersaries euen while you sit in the throne.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Wee can proue it when occasion requireth. In the meane time though we cannot conclude affirmatiuely, that where successiue Ordination is, there is a Church, yet we may conclude negatiuely, that that where it is not, there is no Church.

                  But he was consecrated onely by two as I haue Lib. 1. c. 7. proued. So Euagrius was a lawfull Bishop approued by the Pope and Church of Rome, and consequently in your owne iudgement had succession from the Apostles. Yet as hath beene declared, he was consecrated onely by one, therefore you must confesse that one may be a lawfull Bishop, and haue succession from the Apostles, although he were consecrated onely by one. Yet mistake me not, I speake not this as though any of our English Protestant Bishops since the time of reformation were so consecrated: We are readie to iustifie that their Orders are not onely sufficient in the nature of the thing, but also exact according to the strictnesse of the Canon.

                  Or if they be not, then as those which could not shew their pedegree from Aaron, 
                     Nehe. 7. 64 
                     were put from the Priest-hood; so you must be content to be serued in like manner.

                  SEeing you accuse vs for breaking the golden chaine,
                     3 behold, take it in your hand, examine it from end to end, looke vpon euery lincke, let vs see those breaches, those ruptures, those dissolutions you speake of, and let it appeare to the world, whether you or wee haue broken the Canon. And because you so bragge and blaze your owne Armes, let vs first see how you can proue your glorious succession?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  We can name the Bishops which succeeded one another in their seuerall Sees, euen till the time of Schisme.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  What is this to the purpose? It is one thing to make a Catalogue of Bishops succeeding one another; and another thing to plot out the whole chaine of their successiue ordination. This is the thing you require at our hands, can you performe it? if not, by your owne sentence you must bee put from your Priest-hood.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  We can, if you will grant that vnto vs which is reason should bee graunted. For you must vnderstand that our English Catholicke

Bishops deriue their succession from the Saxons, the Saxons from the French, some of both from the Romane, and the Romane from all Nations; therefore an infinite number of Recordes must bee searched, if wee will particularly deduce the successiue ordination of any one Bishop of later times. Now although the Church in all ages hath beene carefull to record the Consecrations, yet it is possible that some may bee omitted by negligence of Registers, it is possible that some formerly recorded may bee perished by iniury of time, it is possible that some yet remayning vpon record, cannot by vs bee attained because they are in the hands of our enemies. But what of all this? seeing the law of the Church in all ages and kingdomes required three, seeing the constant practise of the Christian world, was continuallie by three, therefore when wee reade of any Bishop generally reputed a Bishop, performing the office of a Bishop, by giuing holy orders, subscribing to generall Councels, executing without any checke or controulement the duties belonging to a Bishoppe, wee may in all reason presume that he was made canonically by three; if there be neither publike fame, nor probable reason nor suspition to the contrary. For wanton wittes must not bee suffered vpon their owne fancy to call reuerend antiquity into question. Otherwise seeing none can bee a Bishop vnlesse hee bee first a Priest, a peeuish man might denie them to bee Bishops vnlesse hee did see their letters of orders. Againe seeing no man can bee a Priest except hee bee baptised, a froward fellow might deny their Priesthood, vnlesse it could bee produced, by whom and where they were baptised. No Sir, wee may not admit of such dealing, neither must wee bee put to prooue these things, but when there is nothing to the contrary, wee may presume them to bee done according to the lawes of the Church, and the generall practise of all Christian nations.

                  You speake reason: Onely this I require at your hands, that the same libertie which you assume to your selues, you will according to equity allow to others, and seeing you chalenge all the Bishops before Cranmer for your owne, may it please you to let vs see the seuerall linckes of your golden chaine, from the first conuersion vntill his time, and we will extend them to this present day.

                  The first conuersion may bee considered in generall or in particular, In generall it is most cleare, that our countrey receiued very anciently the Christian faith. Theod. de curandis grecorū affec. l. 9. 
                     Theodoret saith: Neither the Aethiopians which

                     Parsons proposeth this very faintly; not daring to say it is, but it seemeth to bee: neither seemeth to bee confirmed, but seemeth to bee somewhat confirmed; and yet this somewhat is neuer a whit: for Innocent saith not that these Churches were all founded by Saint Peter, but by Saint Peter or his schollers and successors. Neither doth it appeare that hee speaketh of Britaine, either expresly or by consequence, for though it bee an Iland, yet it lyeth neither betweene Italy and France, nor Italy and Spaine, nor Italy and Africk, nor betweene France and Spaine, nor France and Africk, nor betweene Spaine & Africk, neither is it neere to Sicily. What then is the meaning of Innocent? hauing named on the one side of the Mediterranean sea Italy, France and Spaine: and on the other side Africk; hee addeth Sicily and the Ilands that lye betweene them: as though hee should haue saide, Sicily and the other Ilands in the Mediterranean sea; howsoeuer, the scituation will not suffer vs to vnderstand it of Britaine.

                     this founding of Churches in England by Saint Peter, it may bee thought that 
                     Gild. Epist. 2. de excid. & conq. Brit. Gildas had relation, when expostulating with the Britaine Priestes of his time for their wickednesse (for which the wrath of God brought in the English Saxons vpon them) hee obiecteth among other things; Quod sedem Petri apostoli inuerecundis pedibus vsurpassent: That they had vsurped the seate of Saint Peter with vnshame fast feete: meaning thereby, either the whole Church of Britanie first founded by him, or some particular place of deuotion, or Church which hee had erected.

                  Neither is Parsons peremptory in this point. For he saith not, it is to be thought, but it may be thought; wherefore in his owne iudgement it is not a consequence of necessitie, but a collection of probabilitie; and to any indifferent man it will not appeare so much as probable, if hee ponder the place of Gildas: Sedem Petri Apostoli inuerecundis pedibus vsurpantes, sed merito capiditatis in Iudae traditoris pestilentem Cathedram decidentes: they occupy the seate of Peter with vnshame fast feete, but by the desert of their couetousnesse, they fall into the pestilent chaire of the traitour Iudas. If the chaire of Iudas doe not argue that Iudas was in England, why should the seate of Peter argue that Peter was in England? And the same Gildas a little after speaking against such Bishops as ordained Symoniacall persons, saith; Nicholaum in locum Stephani martyris statuunt; they install Nicholas into the place of the Martyr Saint Steuen: Doth this proue that the Martyr Saint Steuen was locally in England, or that either the whole Church of Britaine or any particular place of deuotion was founded by him? No more doth the other, concerning Saint Peter.

                  Hee lamenteth to see those Churches which had beene gouerned by zealous men like to Saint Peter, and Saint Steuen, now to be defiled with vncleane persons like vnto Iudas and Nicholas the Deacon.

                  Why should he rather name Peter, then any other Apostle, if Peter were not in England?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The speech of Christ concerning the feeding of his flocke was directed in a speciall manner to Peter, whence it commeth to passe, that all to whom the care of feeding Christs flocke is committed, are called Saint Peters successors. Saint Chrys. de sacerd. l. 2. 
                     Chrysostome saith; Why did Christ shed his blood? truly that he might purchase those sheepe, the charge where of the committed to Peter, and Peters successours; And this he saith to Saint Basil, to incourage him in the Episcopall office. Whereby it is euident that Chrysostome calleth all that feed Christes flocke, Saint Peters successours. In like manner they may bee saide to occupie Saint Peters seate, not locally, but in respect of their doctrine and holy conuersation. And all such as by Simony inuade this holy function; all that defile it with heresie or leaudenesse of life, may bee saide to vsurpe the seate of Peter with vncleane feete. Thus much for the place of Gildas.

                     Rienuallus an English Abbot, left written aboue 500. yeeres agone, a certaine reuelation or apparition of Saint Peter to an holy man in the time of King Edward the confessour, shewing him how hee had preached himselfe in England, and consequently, the particular care hee had of that Church and nation.

                  This your fashion, when you cannot proue a thing by sufficient testimonies, you runne to dreames and reuelations not worth the answering. And yet this doting dreame extendeth not so farre as Parsons dreameth. For Alredus in that place relateth how in the time of King Edward the Confessour, Saint Peter appeared vpon the night in a vision, to a certaine recluse who had liued in a caue vnder the ground many yeeres, and bad him tell the King that he had dispensed with his vowe, concerning his going a pilgrimage, and instead thereof had commaunded him by the Pope to builde a Monasterie, which hee thus described; Est mihi locus, &c. I haue (quoth Saint Peter) a place in the West part of London chosen by my selfe, and deare vnto mee, which sometimes I did dedicate with my owne handes, renowne with my presence, and illustrate with diuine miracles, the name whereof is 
                     Westminster. 
                     Thorneia. This is all in effect which he saith, and yet here is no mention of his preaching in England; Therefore Parsons hath committed a notable falsification.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Is it not said that he did dedicate it with his owne hands, renown it with his presence, and illustrate it with diuine miracles?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  That doth not proue the point in question. For Alredus presently after declareth, how in the dayes of Ethelbert King of Kent, Sebertus King of the East Saxons built without the walls of London Westward, a Monastery to S. Peter, and withall addeth, how the night before the dedication, Saint Peter appeared in the habit of a Pilgrim, to a certaine Fisherman vpon the Thames, and being transported by him to Westminster, went presently to the Church, where there was suddenly a glorious light, a multitude of Angels, heauenly melodie, with an vnspeakable fragrancy of sweet odours. Now the solemnitie of the dedication being finished, he returned to the Fisherman,

who at his command, cast his net into the riuer, and tooke a great draught of fishes, which Saint Peter bad him take for his passage, reseruing onely one of extraordinarie greatnesse to himselfe, which hee sent for a token to Mellitus Bishop of London. Here is his miracle, his presence, and his dedication of the Church, with his owne hands; but here is no preaching; or if there were, then he preached more then 500. yeeres after he was dead. But why doe I dwell so long vpon so fond a fable? Or what is this to the first Conuersion of England? Wherefore I conclude, that though S. Peter were a famous Fisher, searched innumerable streames through the wide world, and catched many thousand soules; yet father Parsons hath not made it appeare by any sound authoritie that euer hee spred hisnet in the English Ocean.

                  If this blessed worke were performed by S. Paul or Simon of3 Canany, then we may boldly say, that the first conuerters were not sent by S. Peter.

And verely that he was here, is a point not without probability. He was the Apostle of the Gentiles, in labours abundant, in perils often, and that by Sea▪ he was a Starre swiftly gliding from East to West, a Herauld proclaiming the acceptable day of the Lord: and a shrill trumpet sounding out the Name of Iesus. Now though father Parsons say, that for his being in Britaine, there are not so many particular testimonies, yet those which he hath brought are farre more pregnant then the former, for the comming of S. Peter. To passe ouer the rest, what can be more plaine and direct, then that of Venant. l. 3. de vita sanct. Mart. in fine.

But howsoeuer, there is not one word of S. Peter; yet Parsons brings him to auouch that Aristobulus was sent by S. Peter. And whereas Parsons calleth him S. Peters scholler, he is not so described by Dorotheus, but rather as S. Pauls. Therfore if he were Bishop of Britaine, it is farre more likely that he was sent by S.

                     King Inas aboue 900. yeeres past, when he layd the foundation of Glastenbury Abbey, in memory of S. Ioseph and his fellowes, that had liued a solitary life there, caused these Verses to be written in the Church.
                  
                  
                     Anglia plaude lubens, mittittibi Roma salutem;

                  Be glad England, for that Rome sendeth health to thee, and Apostolicall brightnesse doeth lighten Glastenburie; Which could not well be spoken, if the comming of these Saints and first inhabiters there, had not had some relation to Rome, and to the Apostles that sent them.

                  If Inas layed the foundation of Glastenbury Abbey in memorie of S. Ioseph, who liued there, then we haue a noble Monument of Iosephs being in England. But that euer he was at Rome, or sent hither by any Bishop of Rome, is more then we can find, or you can proue. William of Apud Camd. quo supra. 
                     Malmesbury declareth, That when the ancient Church built by Ioseph, was vtterly decayed, there was another built by Deui Bishop of S. Dauids; Which also in time growing ruinous, was repaired by 12. men comming out of the North: but K. Inas pulled it downe, and reared a stately one to Christ, Peter, and Paul. In this certaine Verses are written; The first 12. whereof, are a continuall commendation of Peter and Paul, by way of comparison; then follow those two which you haue cited, in which he willeth England to reioyce. And why? because Rome sendeth her health: But how? the next verse declareth, Because the Apostolicke brightnesse doeth lighten Glastenbury. Where if the Poet speake of the brightnes of doctrine (as you seeme to take it) then it is not necessary to referre it to the first inhabitants; it may haue relation to the doctrine not long before preached by Austin: For I know you will call his doctrine Apostolicke. Yet it seemeth, that the Poet meaneth not the brightnesse of doctrine, but of patronage and protection: imagining according to the corrupt opinion of those times, that the Saints by whose names the Churches were called▪ were Patrons and Protectors of the said Churches. For in the words following, Peter and Paul, are called two Bulwarks and towers of faith. And K. Inas (who dedicated the Church vnto them,) is said to haue giuen these Bulwarks, as euerlasting gifts to his people. By which what can be meant, but that those Apostles were now by his Dedication, become their Bulwarks and towers of protection? So the Apostolicke brightnesse, (that is their glorious Patronage and protection,) is said to shine most radiantly ouer Glastenbury; And health is said to be sent from Rome, because they ascribe their safety to those Apostles, which were the founders of the Church of Rome: which doeth in no case argue that Christianitie was first brought hither from Rome.

                  To whom had Frumentius recourse for the conuerting of India? The Story whereof is this. A Tyrian Philosopher arriuing in India, was slaine by the Barbarians, with all his company, except two little children which were gone out of the shippe and were learning their lessons vnder a tree. These children were brought vp by the King and aduanced by him: one of them, that is Adesius, beeing made his Steward, the other, that is Frumentius, his Secretary. Afterward the King dying, and leauing his sonne in his nonage, the Queene intreated them both, but especially Frumentius, to assist her in the Gouernement of the kingdome. While Frumentius was in this authority hee inquired among the Romane Merchants for Christians, hee shewed them all fauour and countenance; and admonished them to haue their assembles for praier and the seruice of God. When the King came to age, they deliuered him the kingdome and departed: Adesius to Tyre, Frumentius to Alexandria: where hee went to Athanaesius, and told him what was done, intreating him to send some worthy Bishop to those multitudes of Christians, and to those Churches which were built in that barbarous place. Then Athanasius calling an assembly of Priests, said, Where shall we finde such a man in whom is the spirit of God to performe these things? so hee made Frumentius Bp. & sent him into India, and the Lord blessed his labours, signes and wonders were wrought by him, and an infinite company of those barbarous people were conuetted to the faith. This Story is recorded by Ruff Eccl. Hist. l. 1. c. 9. 
                     Ruffinus (who liued at the same time) not out of the rumors of the people, but by the relation of Adesius himselfe (the companion of Frumentius) who was afterward a Priest of Tyre: And Soc. l. 1. c. 15

Thus Athanasius sent a Bishop to conuert India without consulting with the Bishop of Rome, which verely he would haue done if hee had thought it necessary. But the Pope then did challenge no such thing, neither did that age ascribe it to him. Wherefore the Kings sending to Eleutherius was not of necessity, but because it stood most with his conueniencie.

For he was the Vicar of Christ in his owne Kingdome. And as hee did not interpose himselfe in matters temporall; so neither doth it appeare, that hee did in matters spirituall, or ecclesiasticall. Hee sent not one Preacher into Britaine, before hee was entreated by the King. Neither doe wee finde that hee assumed to himselfe any authoritie in erecting of Bishoprickes.

Eleutherius did not obtrude any vpon the kingdome, but onely sent Bed. l. 1. c. 4.

                     Bede be witnes, who declareth, that a Synod being appointed, the Britaine Bishops came to a certaine holy Anchoret, and asked his counsell, Whether they should leaue their Traditions at the preaching of Austin; Who answered, If he be a man of God, follow him They said, how may we try this? He answered, The Lord saith, Take vp my yoke vpon you, and learne of mee, for I am meeke and humble of heart: Therefore if Austin bee meeke and humble in heart, it is credible, that both hee himselfe beareth the yoke of Christ, and offereth it to be borne of others; But if he be churlish and proud, it is certaine that he is not of God, neither are wee to regard his words. Then they enquired of him againe, how they might know whether he was proud, or no. Pr

And truely as this Anchoret bad them, so did they. For it happened, that when they came thither, Austin was already there, and sate in his Chaire; Which when they saw, straightway waxing wroth, they noted him of pride: and therefore indeuoured to ouerthwart and gaine say, whatsoeuer he proposed His Oration was thus; Although in many other points ye doe contrary to our custome, or rather contrary to the custome of the Vniuersall Church of Christ: Yet notwithstanding, if you will in these three things obey me, That is, In celebrating Easter in due time, In accomplishing the Ministerie of Baptisme, (by which wee are borne againe to God) according to the maner of the holy Romane, and Apostolicke Church, And last of all, in preaching with vs to this English Nation the word of our Lord; All your other Ceremonies, fashions and customes, though they be contrary to ours, yet wee will willingly suffer, and bee content to beare with them. But they answered, That they would doe none of the things requested, neither would accompt him for their Archbishop; Saying with themselues: Nay, if hee would not so much as rise to vs, truely, the more we should now subiect our selues to him,
                     
                     the more would he hereafter despise vs, and set vs at nought.

Then belike as by his not rising they tooke occasion to reiect him, so though he had risen, they would haue found some cuasion, and not haue yeelded vnto him. But is not this an vncharitable iudgement? Hee called a Synod of the neerest and greatest Prouince? they came vnto it, but withall wished, that the matter might be debated in a greater Synod. That also was agreed vpon, and they appeared; But before the appearance, they asked aduise of him, who was thought most godly and wise. The aduise was this in effect, If hee behaue himselfe humbly, accept of him; If hee shew himselfe disdainfull, reiect him. Now, what reason is there to thinke, but as they followed his counsell in reiecting him, because the euent did shew him proud, so they would haue accepted of him, if in the euent they had found him courteous!

                  How could they depart from it, seeing they were neuer lincked to it by any bond of obedience? For when should Rome haue any such iurisdiction ouer Britaine? At the first planting of Religion? You cannot proue it. In the dayes of Eleutherius, it doeth not appeare that euer he chalenged any such thing. And euen their maner of Baptizing, obseruing Easter, and other Ecclesiasticall institutions, contrary to the customes of the Church of Rome, make more then probable proofe, that Britaine was not vnder the iurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Wherefore, though we cannot excuse the Britaines, for refusing to ioyne with him in the conuersion of the Saxons, yet wee must needs say, they had iust reason to refuse to put their necks vnder his yoke. And surely if Austin had not had a proud spirit, hee would onely haue requested their helping hand for the Lords worke, and notc Greg. in resp. ad inter. Aug. inter 9. apud Bed. lib. 1. cap. 27. haue sought dominion ouer them for himselfe, and for his lord the Pope. Yet the pride of his spirit, and his aspiring cogitations may further appeare; in that he demaunded of Gregorie, i 
                     How he should deale with the Bishops of Britaine
                     
                     and France, thereby affecting not only to haue iurisdiction ouer the Britaines, but ouer the French also. Which Gregory well ynough perceiuing, answered, We gaue thee no authoritie ouer the Bishops of France: for that of ancient time of my predecessours, the Bishop of Arles receiued his Pall, whom we must not bereaue of his authoritie. Thus much of his pride.
                  NOw whether he were the cause of the massacre following, I will not3 define. You shall heare the opinion of Antiq: Brit. p. 48. 
                     Amandus Xierixensis, a Frier Minorite; When the Brittans (saith hee) were Catholiks, the Saxons were Gentiles, for the conuersion of whom blessed Gregory sent Austin and Mellitus, which conuerted the Saxons, but when Austin would haue brought the Bishops and Abbots of the Brittans by Apostolicke authority, that they should receiue him as Legate, and preach with him to the English, discord was mooued for their disobedience to Saint Austin, and so warre was raised betweene the Kings of the Brittans, and of the Saxons, which, now beeing conuerted would haue subdued the Brittans to Austin.

Bed. l. 2. c. 2. himselfe testifieth how Austin threatfully prophesied, that if they would not take peace, and bee at concord with their brethren, they should receiue warre from their enemies; and if they would not preach to the Englishmen the way of life, they should suffer at their hand, and by their power, the vengcance of death. Now because the euent did answere to the speech, it is called a prophesie. For what followed? Edilbert King of Kent, moued Edelfride King of Northumberland to ioyne with him against the Brittans, and there was made a bloudy massacre, the narration whereof is thus set downe by Galf. Monemut. l.

                     Galfridus Monemutensis. In a part of the Brittans, Christianity yet flourished, the which beginning in the daies of Eleutherius, neuer failed among them. When Austin came, hee found seuen Bishopricks, and an Archbishopricke supplied with very godly Gouerners, and Abbies a great number, in which the flocke of Christ was kept in good order. Besides other Cities, in the Citie of Bangor, there was a most noble Church of 21. hundred monks, all liuing with the labour of their hands. Their Abbot was named Dinooch, a man marueilously well learned, who by diuerse arguments made it appeare, when Austin required the Bishops to bee subiect vnto him, that they ought him no subiection. Edilbert therefore the King of Kent, as soone as hee saw them refuse to yeeld obedience to Austin, and despise his preaching, stirred vp Edelfride, and other Princes of the Saxons to gather a great army, and goe to Bangor, to destroy Dinooch and his Clergie; Who taking the City commaunded the swords of his men to bee turned first vpon the monkes; so twelue hundred of them the same day decked with martyrdome entred the kingdome of Heauen. If they were martyrs, what were they that made them Martyrs? If the Saxons were persecutors, and did persecute them, to that end that they might make them subiect to Austn, what then is to bee thought of Austin? It had beene the dutie of Austin, (saith Vide antiq: Brit. p. 9. 
                     Lelandus) to haue admonished the Saxons that perfidious nation, that if they would admit Christianity sincerely, they should restore to the iust Lords and possessours, the Empire of Brittaine, which contrarie to the oath of warfare, they had occupied by tyranny. If Austin sought, by any sinister meanes, to enlarge his owne iurisdiction, hee was farre vnlike to Palladius, Bishop of Scotland, who (as 
                     Hist. Ang. l. 3. 
                     Polydor witnesseth) besought Constantine their king with many prayers, that hee would not assist with armes, the idolatrous nation of the Saxons against the Christian Brittans.

                  Yes, if you consider the question of Austin, and the answere of Gregory. The question proposed was this: If

                     the Bishops are so farre apart one from the other, that they cannot conueniently assemble together, whether one may bee ordained a Bishop without the presence of other Bishops? Gregory answereth, In the Church of England in which thou 
                     
                        Greg. either did not know or did not remember that Lethardus the Queenes Chaplaine was a Bishop. as Bede calleth him. l. 1. c. 25. 
                     onely art as yet a Bishop, thou canst ordaine none, but without other Bishops. For when come there any Bishops out of France which might assist thee in ordeyning Bishops? We will therefore that thou ordaine Bishops, but so that they may not bee farre one from an other, that there be no such necessity but that they may hereafter come together to the creation of other. The Curats also, whose presence may do good, should

                  Doctor Stapleton being a man of such learning, wisedome, and zeale, and purposing to benefite his country in singular manner by turning the story of Saint Bede into English, without question did vse all possible diligence to get varietie of copies, both printed and manuscript, and comparing all together, made choice of the best.

                  Then haue I followed the best edition of Bede, for I haue not departed one letter from the translation of Stapleton; yet you see your owne approued edition which Stapleton made choise of, conuinceth, that Pope Gregory willed Austin at first to make bishops alone, though hee would haue none created afterward without three or foure.

And in the Chapter following, Gregory writeth to Austin, sendeth him a Pall, and willeth him to ordaine twelue Bishops, But of French Bishops to assist him, he saith nothing at all. And in the second booke and third Chapter it is declared, how that in the yeere of the incarnation of our Lord 604. Austin Archbishop of Britane consecrated two Bishops, Mellitus Bishop of London, and Iustus Bishop of Rochester, but of any French Bishops assisting him there is no mention. And for the Brittish Bishops that they should helpe him, it is not once to be imagined, because they stood at vtter defiance with him. Therefore if wee consult with Stapletons Bede, and embrace that copy for best which hee followed, it will appeare that Austin proceeded to Episcopall consecration, and yeelding to necessitie, made the first Bishop, that is Mellitus, alone, and the next that is Iustus, by the assistance of Mellitus onely, and when there was a canonicall number, then they obserued the number of three at the least.

                  Surely in diuerse copies it is otherwise then you haue alleadged: as for example, in the Parisian edition of Gregory, Anno 1586. It is thus, Et quidem etiam in Anglorum ecclesia in qua adhuc solus tu Episcopus inueniris, ordinare Episcopum non aliter nisi cum Episcopis potes. i. Truly euen in the Church of the English, wherein thou onely art found as yet to bee a Bishop, thou canst not ordaine Bishops otherwise then with other Bishops. And because Austin was the onely Bishop then in England, therefore in the next sentence he telleth him, whence hee shall haue Bishops; Nam quando de Gallijs Episcopi veniunt, illi in ordinatione Episcopi testes tibi assistant. i. For when the Bishops come out of France, let them assist thee in the ordination of a Bishop.
                  
               
               
                  ORTH.
                  For the clearing of this point we must consider both these sentences with their dependencie and connexion. In the former there are two

readings, cum Episcopis, and sine Episcopis. The latter was followed by Doctour Stapleton, and is the true reading. For vnderstanding that in Oxford some were appointed for the collation of the printed copies of Gregorie, with the manuscripts, I enquired how this place was read in the manuscripts, and answere was made that these Interrogata were not in the written copies, but inserted as it seemeth into the workes of Gregory out of Bede. Then I enquired after the manuscripts of Bede, and saw diuerse, all consenting in this reading sine Episcopis, with which concordeth a most worthy copie of venerable antiquitie at Eton Colledge, which the learned and iudicious Sir Henry Sauil did shew vnto me. With the manuscripts agreeth your own last edition of the workes of Bede printed at Collen in the yeere 1612. As also the Epistles of Gregory both in the Romane edition, as they are in the Councels set out by Surius and Binius: yea these Interrogata are produced by Iohn 
                     
                        Ioh. Capgrauius Catal. sanct. in sancto Augustino f. 3. It is in the library of Corp. Chri. Coll. in Oxford. 
                     Capgraue who readeth precisely in the same manner. Wherefore it is as cleare as the noone day, that the true reading is sine Episcopis, as Stapleton translateth: and thus much of the first sentence. In the second wee must consider, both the reading and the pointing, concerning the varietie of reading (to passe ouer de gallis and de gallijs, veniunt and venient, which are of small moment, and doe not alter the sense.) The Parisian and Romane editions, read (illi) which is erronious, for the true treading is qui, to bee iustified by Capgraue, the manuscripts before alleadged, and Doctour Stapleton. Now the wordes being thus cleared, must needes bee read with an interrogation, (otherwise there will bee no sence) and the latter sentence rendreth a reason of the former in this manner. Thou must needs make Bishops alone, for who should assist thee? the Britaines? they stand in opposition, and are not once to be thought vpon: the English? there are none: both which branches hee presupposeth as granted: the French? but when doeth any of them come ouer into England: as though hee should say, their comming is vncertaine, so he concludeth, that Austin must make Bishops alone without other Bishops. Now from Austin we will proceede to his successours

Nam Thomas Cranmerus qui sub Henrico 8. Cantuariensem Episcopatum obtinuit, non fuit consecratus ab vllo Episcopo, sed a solo rege intrusus & designatus; igitur quotquot ab eo postea consecrati sunt, non legitimè, sed e

                      Thomas Cranmer who vnder K. Henry the 8. obtained the Bishopricke of Canterburie was not consecrated by any Bishop, but intruded and designed by the King alone; therefore as many as were afterward consecrated by him, were not consecrated lawfully, but by presumption.

                  Or rather Becan playeth the part of a presumptuous Iesuite against the Lords annointed, in saying that King Henry intruded Cranmer, as also in glauncing at his most famous and religious successours, as though they themselues had consecrated Bishops. For what needed he to moue any such question, if it were not to raise a mist, and cast a cunning surmise to induce men to thinke that it was so? But indeede it was not so: for our soueraignes in the aduancing of Bishops do nothing but that which they may lawfully by their Princely right, agreeable to the patterne of most religious Kings and Emperours, and iustifiable both by the lawes of God and the land, as in due place shall appeare. And as hee wrongeth the Prince, so doth hee traduce Archbishop Cranmer, as though he were consecrated either by the King, or by none at all, and consequently the whole Clergie of England at this day, deriuing their consecration from that renowned Martyr. But if this accusation were true, doe you not marke how it would make a cracke in your golden chaine, of succession, wherein you so reioyce and glory? For if Cranmer were no Bishop, then some approoued in Queene Maries time would prooue no Bishops, as for example, Anthony Kitchen, Bishop of Landaff, and Thomas Thurlby, Bishop of Ely, both which Ex Regist. Cranm. deriued their Consecration from Cranmer, as may be iustified by records; the latter whereof was highly commended by the Pope and made one of his

                     Take heed that you call not againe into question, a thing which is alreadie iudged. About three daies after, Longland beeing brought by Wolsey vnto the King, entreated his Maiestie, That hee would permit the matter to bee considered and examined. In the meane time, the Cardinall did cast abroad rumors among the people, concerning the blemish of the former marriage, and how both the Germanes and French men misliked the same; which hee is supposed to haue done not of conscience, but of

                  WHich proiect, (though God which scattereth the imaginatiōs of the2 proud disapointed him of his purpose) was such, that nothing could haue bin inuented, either more profitable for the kingdome, or more pernicious to himselfe, the Pope, and the Court of Rome. For this scruple did kindle

such a fire in the kings bosome, that it vexed his very soule and conscience. Whereupon the king being desirous to haue the matter decided to the vttermost, so farre preuailed with Pope Clement the seuenth, that hee appointed two Cardinals to heare the matter: Wolsey Archbishop of Yorke, & Hollinsh. p. 906. 
                     Campeius who arriued the seuenth of October 1528. At this time there was great war between Charles 
                     Antisand. p. 15. 
                     the Emperor, and Francis the French king, about the kingdome of Naples, wherein the Pope wished that the French might preuaile, least the Emperour obtaining it should sit too close vpon his skirts. Wherefore to weaken the Emperour, he moued a league betweene the English and the French; for procuring whereof hee did not onelie referre this matrimoniall cause to his said Legats but also of his owne meere motion no man requesting him, gaue Campeius a secret Bull The coppie whereof is in Antisand: p. 200. in his bosome, dated the sixth of the kal: of Ian. anno 1527. Wherein hee infringeth the former dispensation, affirming, that the king could not continue in such a matrimonie without sinne. Whereupon he decreed, that after the declaration of the nullitie of the former marriage and the kings absolution, it should be lawfull for him to marry another. This Bull hee forbad him to shew to any saue onely to the King and Cardinall Woolsey. And though Antis. p. 15. 
                     openly he commaunded him to handle the cause with all expedition, yet secretlie hee willed him to protract the time, promising that hee himselfe would watch a fit oportunitie to publish the Decree. So the King and Queene were cited to appeare before them in May following, at which time after some debating of the cause, they protracted the sentence till the beginning of August, notwithstanding the Kings earnest entreatie, to haue a finall determination one way or other, for the better quieting of his troubled conscience. When August came, the King expected an end, but the crafty Cardinals considering, that if they should iudge according to Gods law, it would bee a great derogation from the Church of Rome, deuised delayes; so Campeius alleadged, that hee was a member of the Court of Rome, whose custome was to keepe a solemne vacation in the dogge daies, and thereupon deferred iudgement till October following. In the meane time the Pope seeing that King Henry could not bee drawne by hope of diuorce, to take part with the French, sent to Campeius, 
                     Antisanderus p. 17. 
                     Commanding him to burne the former Bull. And before the beginning of October Campeius was called home by the Popes letters. The King beeing thus deluded sent to the Pope at Bononie, requesting some end, but hee would needs pause vpon the matter till he came to Rome.
                  ABout this time it pleased the diuine prouidence so to dispose, that3 the King Antiq. Brit. p. 321. 322. for his recreation, went to Waltam, twelue miles from London, & in the way imparted his griefe to Stephen Gardiner his Secretary, and Doct. Fox his Almoner intreating them to bee carefull in so weighty a cause. It fell out, that they lodged in the house of one Master Cressy, whither Cranmer also (beeing tutor to two of Master Cressyes sonnes) was come at that time with his pupils, by reason of the plague then in Cambridge. At supper they asked his iudgement concerning the Kings cause, hee 
                     Ibidem. 
                     answered, that nothing did more prolong the cause, nor more torment the Kings conscience, then the dilatory protractions, and winding inuolutions in the Romane Court, with which snares whosoeuer are once intangled, doe hardly euer recouer themselues.
                     
                     Wherefore hee thought good, that leauing those Courtly trials and delayes wherewith the King was so tossed with such griefes of minde. The opinions of Diuines both in our owne Vniuersities and in others should bee enquired concerning this cause which is determinable by the Lawe of God, and not by the Law of man. And if the Diuines shall agree and pronounce that the marriage is lawfull or vnlawfull by the Law of God, let not the king seeke any more to the Court of Rome, but cause sentence to bee giuen in his owne dominions, according to the iudgement of the Diuines, so being cheerefull in minde, and free in conscience, hee may liue a Princely life, and worthy this common-wealth in lawfull matrimonie, which is to be wished of all vs Christian subiects. This answere pleased them exceedingly, and they presently related it vnto the King, to whom Doctor Fox made mention of Cranmer, but Gardiner would haue challenged all the glory to themselues. Then said the Act. & Mon. King, Where is that Cranmer, hee hath the sowe by the right eare. If I had knowne this deuice but two yeeres before, I might haue saued much charges and trouble; so the King conferred with Cranmer, and commanded him to set downe his minde in writing; at the deliuery whereof the King asked him if hee would stand to iustifie that which hee had written before the Bishop of Rome: Cranmer answered, yea that I will doe by Gods grace, if your Maiestie doe send mee thither. Marry (quoth the King) and to him will I send you. So hee was sent with the Earle of Wiltshier Embassadour to the Pope; who 
                     Antiq. Brit. pag 322. Act. & Mon. quo supra. 
                     thrust out his glorious foote to bee kissed of them, which (they refusing) the Earles spanniell running somewhat too familiarly, did catch and bite him by the great toe: Then the cause of their Embassage being declared, the Earle deliuered

Cranmers booke to the Pope, and with all tolde him that hee had brought with him learned men out of England, which were ready to defend by Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels, whatsoeuer was contained in that booke against all that should contradict it. The Pope promised sundry times a day of disputation, but dallied out the matter, as his Legates had done before in England, so giuing them honourable entertainment, hee made Cranmer his

                     penitentiarie, and dismissed them. Then the rest returning, Cranmer was sent by the kings appointment, Embassadour into Germany to the Emperour, where hee drewe many vnto his side, and among the rest

Moreouer the King did not onely consult with the most learned Diuines, and Lawyers in the whole kingdome, but also caused the question to bee publiquely disputed in the Vniuersities of Oxford and Cambridge, both which did vtterly condemne the marriage. Neither did hee thus rest, but sent Bishop Holins. in Hen. 8.

                  ABout this time dyed Archbishop Warham while Cranmer was Embassadour in Germany, and vpon the vacancie of the Archbishopricke, the King sent for him home, with purpose to aduance him to that great dignitie: but he pretended matters of great importance requiring his abode in Germany, by which meanes he deferred his comming for halfe a yeeare. And being come home, and perceiuing that the place was reserued for him, hee imployed his greatest friends to shift it off. When the King did personally impart his intent vnto him, hee disabled himselfe by all possible meanes, vsing all perswasions to alter the Kings determination. When he saw the Kings constant resolution, he humbly crauing pardon of his grace, franckly opened his conscience vnto him, declaring that if hee accepted that office, then hee must receiue it at the Popes hand; which he neither would not could doe, for that his highnesse was the onely supreme gouernour of this Church of England, as well in causes ecclesiasticall as temporall, & that the donation of Bishoprickes belonged to the King, and not to any forraine authoritie whatsoeuer. All which proceedings doe not argue any ambitious or aspiring cogitations, but rather an humble and lowly minde: preferring the sinceritie of a good conscience before all glorious pompe, and worldly dignities. The King seeing the tendernesse of his conscience, consulted with the learned in the law, how hee might bestow the Bishopricke vpon him, and yet not enforce him to any thing against his conscience. In conclusion, hee tooke the oath to the Pope, but not after the manner of his predecessours, as De Sch▪ l. 1. pag. 58. 
                     Sanders slanderously affirmeth. For then hee should haue taken it simply and absolutely, which hee did not, but with a protestation, expressing the condition and qualification. Neither did hee make his protestation priuately in a corner, and then take the oath in publicke, as Sanders would make the world beleeue, (for if this could bee proued, then had you reason to condemne him of fraud and periurie,) but it was not so. He did not vse his protestation in any secret and concealed manner like to equiuocating Papists, which take oaths in absolute words, and yet delude them with mentall reseruations: but he made it plainely and publickly, first in the Chapter house; secondly kneeling before the high Altar in the hearing both of the Bishops and people at his consecration: Thirdly, in the very same place, and in the very same forme and tenour of wordes, when by commission from the Pope, they deliuered him the Pall. And the summe of the protestation was this, that hee 
                     Ex Reg. Cranm. fol. 4. b. 
                     intended not to binde himselfe to anything which was contrary to the lawe of God, or contrary
                     
                     to the king or common wealth of England, or the Lawes and prerogatiues of the same, nor to restraine his owne libertie to speake, consult, or consent, in all and euery thing, concerning the reformation of Christian religion, the gouernment of the Church of England, and the prerogatiue of the Crowne, or the commodity of the Common wealth. and euery where to execute and reforme such things, which he should thinke fitte to be reformed in the Church of England, and according to this interpretation, and this sence and no otherwise, he professed and protested, that he would take the oath. Now if you censure Cranmer, because he qualified his oath with such a protestation, what censure shalbe giuen of your Popish Bishops before Cranmer, which took two (absolute) othes, to the King, and to the Ant.

                     Paul the third flashed out his excomunications like lightnings, and interdicted the kingdome, hoping thereby to reduce it to his obedience, or at least to disable the yong Lady for the succession of the crowne. Yet after a while the angrie old man withered away, but the yong Lady did grow vp like the lilly, and flourished like the Rose plant of Prouince. Now though for extirpating the Popes iurisdiction, this renowned King had the honour before and aboue all Christian Princes; yet the glorie of abolishing Popish religion, was

by diuine prouidence reserued to his blessed children, Edward and Elizabeth: They pulled vp superstition by the very roots, whereas their father (for God reuealed his truth by degrees) did onely hew at a few branches. Hitherto of the Popes expulsion.
                  NOw for as much as Archbishop Cranmer was a principall meanes7 thereof, the Papists did hate him worse then a scorpion, heaping vpon him whatsoeuer wit sharpened with malice could possibly deuise. Hee resorted sometimes to the Dolphin in Cambridge, where hee placed his wife, the mistresse of the house being her cousin: therupon they blazed abroad that he was an

And surely King Henry did foresee, that one day, if they might preuaile, they would haue his blood and burne him at a stake. Therefore, whereas hee gaue the three Cranes the ancient armes of his house, the King caused him to change them into three

                     Pelicanes, presaging that he should feed the flock of Christ, with his deerest blood, and dye a Martyr; which came to passe, in the dayes of Queene Mary, when they disgorged all their poisoned malice vpon him. They 
                        Act. & Mon. in the life of Cranmer. disrobed him of his Episcopall ornaments, and put him into a lay mans gowne; they cited him to appeare at Rome within eightie dayes, and put him to death before twentie of them were expired. They caused Alphonso the Spanish Fryer, to draw him to a recantation by sweet promises of life, yet they had a setled purpose to put him to death. They had no intention by Alphonso to do him good, but sought a colour by his recantation to iustifie themselues; so they clapped their hands, and reioyced at his fall. But as hee sinned and denyed his Master with Peter, so God gaue him grace to repent with Peter. And as he lamented all his sinnes, so especially he bewailed his subscribing to Popery with his vnworthy right hand. Wherefore when he came to the fire for a godly reuenge, hee thrust it like another Scaeuola into the flame, and did not so much as draw backe his arme till it was wholly consumed: thus lifting vp his eyes to heauen, in the middest of the furious flames, hee said, Lord Iesus

                  Then you will proue in spite of all Hereticks, that Stephen Gardener was a Schismaticke, Edmund Bonner a schismatick, Cutbert Tunstall a schismaticke, Nicholas Heath a schismaticke, Iohn Stokesly a schismaticke; and in a word, that all the Bishops of your Catholicke Church which were in England, after the banishing of the Pope, till the end of the raigne of King Henry, by the space of 12. yeeres, were notorious schismatickes. For they all reuolted from the Pope, Iohn Fisher Bishop of Rochester onely excepted, who was Hall in H. 8. 206. 
                     then lately made Cardinall, but lost his head before his Hat came ouer. What? will you proue that there were so many schismaticks at once in your Catholicke Church?

Now, Heresie is opposed properly vnto faith, but Schisme is opposed properly to the vnitie of Ecclesiasticall loue. Which is agreeable to In Epist. ad Titum. c. 3. S. Hierome, saying, Betweene Schisme and Heresie, this I take to be the difference, That Heresie hath alwayes a peruerse opinion, but Schisme maketh a separation from the Church. Out of which words, saith Nauar. Manuale. c. 27. p. 878. 
                     Nauarrus, We may gather, That Schisme taken generally, is a sinne whereby one separateth himselfe from due vnitie: but taken specially, it is a sin whereby he is separated from the vnitie of the Church. But what is this to the Pope?

Bin. tom. 1. p. 465. 
                     So soone as I knew, when it pleased God, that you had iustly condemned him, (that is Athanasius,) I presently yeelded my consent to your iudgement, and gaue Letters to be caried to the Emperour Constantius, by our brother Fortunatianus of his name, That is, concerning the condemning of him: therefore Athanasius being remoued; concerning whom the Decrees of you all, are to be receiued of me with the See Apostolicke; I say that I haue peace and vnitie with all you, with all the Easterne Bishops, or through all Prouinces. This Epistle is extant in the Vatican Library, and acknowledged for true and proper by Ibidem. 
                     Binius, who thereupon taketh vp a lamentation, That Liberius the Romane Samson deceiued by enuie and vaine glory, as it were by Dalila, was conquered and lost his golden locks. Thus it appeareth, that this renowned Patriarch, this stout Champion of Iesus Christ, this pillar of the Church, this hammer of Hereticks was diuided from the communion of the Pope, and yet hee was not separated from the blessed communion of Iesus Christ: For when the whole world was against him, he against the whole world defended the cause of Christ, and the Lord gaue him victory. Shall now this glorious Athanasius be reputed a Schismaticke? I hope you wil not dare to say so. If he be not, then one may be separated from the communion of the Bishop of Rome, and yet bee no Schismaticke.

Accuse him you cannot; because if he should haue yeelded, he had rebelled against God, and denied the Diuinitie of Christ: And if you excuse him, then you are forced to confesse, That not euery separation from the Bishop of Rome is a Schisme, but such onely as separateth from the Church of God, and from Christ.

                     the soules, or troubling the commonwealth, and much more if hee goe about to destroy the Church: So there are foure cases wherein Bellarmine holdeth it lawful to resist the Pope. Wherefore, if King Henries case were any of these foure, his resistance was lawfull. To passe ouer the first, and the last, it shalbe sufficient if we ponder the other two, touching the inuading of the soule, and the troubling of the Commonwealth. While the King was yet in his nonage, hee was dispensed with all by the Pope, against the eternall Commandement of God, to marry his brothers wife: and afterward being informed of the vnlawfullnesse thereof, hee intreated the Pope either to iustifie his dispensation by the word of God, or to dissolue the marriage; yet hee would doe neither, but left him long in anguish of minde and perplexitie of conscience: and at last gaue finall sentence to binde him to liue in a marriage, condemned by his owne Cardinals, his owne vniuersities, yea and by his owne former Bull, wherein hee had pronounced, That the King could not continue in it without sin. Let any indifferent man iudge whether this were not to inuade the soules of men? Now let vs see, whether hee did trouble the Commonwealth. By meanes of this dispensation the mindes of men were greatly distracted, some holding with the Pope, others embracing the iudgements of learned men through the famous vniuersities of Christendome. Thus the whole world stood in suspence, and the inheritance, and succession of the Crowne was commonly called in question both by subiects and strangers: Was not this euidently & notoriously to trouble the Commonwealth? So according to Bellarmines positions, it was lawfull for K. Henry, and his subiects to resist the Pope, and therefore this resistance was not schismaticall.

                  You must consider the manner of resistance set downe by Bellarmine: Licet 
                     Quo supra. 
                     inquam ei resistere, non faciendo quod iubet, & impediendo ne exequatur voluntatem suam: non tamen licet eum iudicare, vel punire, vel deponere, quod non est nisi superioris: that is, It is lawfull I say to resist him, by not doing that which hee commaundeth, and by hindring him from executing his will: yet it is not lawfull to iudge him, or punish him, or depose him, which belongeth to none but the superiour.

Now King Henry did challenge no iurisdiction, but ouer his owne subiects, and within his owne dominions, yet it was fit that in his owne necessary defence, hee should remoue papall iniuries, by prouiding as it became a vertuous Prince, for the quiet of his owne conscience, and the good of his subiects. Which blessings could neuer haue beene procured, if the Pope had still enioyed his vsurped authority in England.

                  That which you call Heresie and Apostacy is true religion, and that which you honour with the name of true religion, is full of Heresie and idolatry. Many papall abuses were discouered in the daies of King Henry, moe in the daies of King Edward, so the Gospell was like to the light which shineth more and more, to the perfect day; the brightnesse whereof abolished both the Pope & the Popish religion. Afterward when Queene Mary had restored both, the Lord stirred vp the spirit of Queene Elizabeth, who with an inuincible courage reformed religion. And that which shee happily begunne our gracious Soueraigne King Iames hath happily continued. Neither can any man accuse them of Schisme, vnlesse they will accuse the holy Apostle Saint Paul, who Act. 19. 9 
                     When certaine were hardened and disobeyed, speaking euill of the way of God before the multitude, hee departed from them and separated the Disciples. As the Apostle practised this in his owne person, so hee gaue the like commaundement to others. 1. Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5.

                     Goe not vp to Bethauen. This Bethauen was Bethel, but her idolatry made her Bethauen, therefore goe not vp to Bethauen. If Rome which was sometimes Bethel, the house of God, become Bethauen, the house of vanitie: then thou must not goe vp to Bethauen.

Wherefore though Cranmer had a lawfull consecration, yet it seemeth, when hee fell into schisme and heresie, hee lost his order, and power of ordination. Therefore the Bishops in King Edwards time consecrated by Cranmer receiued nothing, because Cranmer had nothing to giue. And the Bishops in Queene Elizabeths time, consecrated by those whom Cranmer did consecrate, receiued nothing, because their consecrators had nothing to giue. And those which now succeede them, receiued nothing, because their predecessours had nothing to giue.

For all these were consecrated at such time, when in your iudgement both the consecrators and consecrated were stained with schisme and heresie.

had baptised, but kept them in that baptisme which they had in Schisme. For according to Saint Aug. de bap. cont. Donat. l. 5. c. 7. 
                     Austin, some doe minister baptismum legitimum, and that legitimè: some neither legitimè, nor yet legitimum: some legitimum, but not legitimè. Such as performe it in the true element and forme of wordes, being themselues in the bosome and vnitie of the Church, doe minister both legitimum and legitimè: such as faile in the institution, and are themselues in Schisme or Heresie, doe neither minister legitimè, nor yet legitimum: such as doe obserue the substance of institution, being themselues in Schisme or Heresie doe minister legitimum, but not legitimè; And those which receiue it from them haue a lawfull baptisme, but not lawfully. For it is one thing to haue a lawfull thing vnlawfully, and another thing not to haue it at all. The Sacraments of the Church may be found without the Church, as the riuers of Paradise are found without Paradise. Heretickes and Schismatickes may haue rem columbae, though they themselues be extra columbam.

                     the sonnes of Eli were wicked men, and procured Gods heauie wrath against themselues, yet there is no doubt, but the God of all Grace did accept of those Sacrifices, which his faithfull children with an honest heart presented according to the Law of the Lord, to be offered euen by their hands, so long as they inioyed the Office of Priesthood. Our Mat. 5. & 15. & 23. Sauiour in the Gospel, reproued the Scribes and Pharisees for their false and superstitious doctrine, which was so commonly receiued, and so anciently continued, that there can be no question, but many of the Priests were infected with it: Yet Christ commanded the Matth. 8. 4. 
                     Leper to shew himselfe to the Priest. Yea, he himselfe frequented the Feasts, wherein Sacrifices were offered by those Priests. But to goe forward; Can the Eucharist be ministred by a Priest whom the Pope hath excommunicated, and degraded?

                     Character, which is a certaine spirituall and supernaturall power, imprinted in the soule of man in Baptisme, Confirmation,
                     
                     and holy Orders; whereby the Baptized, Confirmed and Ordered, are inabled to giue, or receiue, the Offices of certaine Sacraments. The Character of Confirmation, being not greatly to our present purpose, may bee passed ouer. The Character of Baptisme is a passiue power, whereby the Baptized is made 
                           •
                        it to receiue other Sacraments, whereof without Baptisme he were vncapable. The Character of Order, is an actiue power to minister the Sacraments vnto other. Now, in holy Orders it must be obserued, That the Priestly Character doeth differ from the Episcopall. For the Episcopall is either an other, or the same extended: so that it conteineth the Priestly, and somewhat else. A Priest in respect of his Priestly Character, is first of all the publicke and ordinary Minister of Baptisme: For a Lay-man may not Baptise publickely, but onely priuately; Neither priuately in the presence of the Priest or Deacon, but onely in their absence. Neither alwayes in their absence; but onely in case of necessitie; for then a Lay-man, be he Iew or infidel, may Baptize, so hee intend to doe that, which the Catholicke Church doeth, in that kinde of Administration. A Deacon may Baptise, not onely priuately but publickely, so it be at the appointment of the Bishop or Priest. But a Priest may suo iure Baptize, ex Officio, euen in the presence of a Bishop; as is declared by In Catechis. Trident. 
                     Pius Quintus, and the Councell of Trent, who qualifie the contrary opinion, and reduce it to a tollerable sence. Secondly, a Priest by vertue of his Priestly Character, may consecrate the Hoaste, which no Lay-man, King, nor Emperour, no Angel, nor Archangel, can performe: because they want this Character. Indeed a Deacon may helpe to minister the Eucharist, but he cannot Consecrate, no not by dispensation; If he should take it vpon him, he should effect nothing. But euery Priest receiueth in his Ordination, a Character, not from man, but from the Eternall God, which in respect of the Eucharist, is absolute, perfect and independent.

                  If by indeleble Character bee meant onely a gracious gift neuer to be reirerated, then we may safely confesse, that in Baptisme, and holy Orders, there is imprinted an indeleble Character. For a man rightly Baptized, becomming a Turke or a Iew, and afterward returning to the faith, and Church of Christ, is in no case to be rebaptized: the vertue of his former Baptisme is not spunged out, but still remaineth auaileable. Likewise when a Priest lawfully ordained, becoming a schismaticke, or hereticke is iustly censured for his crimes, and afterward is reclaimed; if the Church shall need his labours, and hold it conuenient that he execute the Ministeriall function, hee may in no case be reordained, but may performe it by vertue of his Orders formerly receiued. Hitherto of a Priest.

Church; therefore the personall iniquitie of the seruant, cannot disanull the gracious gift of the master. For who conferred Priesthood among the Iewes? After the consecration of Aaron and his sonnes, which was performed by the hands of Exod. 29. leuit 8. 
                     Moses, and was extraordinary, there is no doubt but the honour of it belonged ordinarily to the high Priest. But did not Aaron make a

Yet so long as they liued, they did execute the Pontificall office, neither were their Ordinations called in question; no not the Ordinations of Annas and Caiaphas. But is there the same reason here also of Hereticks and schismatiks?

From Peter their last teacher, vnto the sixth Synode, there came betweene no fewer then fifteene yeeres, in which space were Thomas, Iohn, and Constantine, ordained of heretikes, who notwithstanding were not for this cause reiected. The heresie lasted about fiftie yeeres, yet the fathers in the sixth Synod condemned onely the forenamed foure: whereby it is euident, that heresie in their iudgement doth not take away the power of giuing orders, which you confesse, and must needes, because one of your owne Popes was ordained by heretikes: if Felix the second were a Pope.

                     the time of Gregory the thirteenth, the Roman Martyrologe was set out at Rome, where there was a great controuersie among learned men concerning Felix, whether his name were to bee spunged out: and Baronius with many other were of that opinion: but it fell out as it were by a diuine miracle, the very day before Saint Felix his day, that some digging for treasure found a chest, wherein was this inscription; The body of Felix, Pope and Martyre, which condemned Constantius: so Baronius yeelded to Felix, as it were pleading his owne cause: especially seeing Pope Gregory himselfe, was of that iudgement. Therefore we confesse that Felix was a lawfull Pope, although his entrance is much to be misliked. For Bin. in notis in vitam Felicis. 2. t. 1. p. 490. 
                     according to the common sentence of the Fathers, hee was intruded by the Arians, and ordained of them: therefore at the first, while Liberius suffered persecution

for the Catholicke Faith, hee was a Schismaticall Anti-pope, but as Ibidem. 
                     Binius saith, from such time as hee aduanced the banner of faith, by excommunicating Constantius, Vrsacius, Valens and other Arians, and Liberius for his manifest Communion with Hereticks, was plainely accounted banished from the Communion of Catholikes, omnium Catholicorum iudicio, quanquam antea schismaticus fuisset, legitimus Ecclesiae Catholicae Pontifex haebericaepit, that is, Although before he had beene a schismatick yet then he began to bee accounted the lawfull Bishop of the Catholick Church by the iudgement of all Catholickes.

                  THen Pope Stephen was much to blame, who Ex Sigeberto in Chron. an. 902 & 903. vnordained them whom his predecessor Formosus had ordained, and he also gaue out a commandement, that they should al be In vita Seph. 7.

Yea hee tooke vp his carkasse out of the graue, brought it vnto iudgement before a councell of Bishops, spoiled it of the papall robes, cloathed it in a lay-man gowne, endited it, arraigned it, condemned it, cut off those fingers which were principally vsed in consecration, and cast it into the streame of Tyber.

For though Formosus had neuer beene Pope, yet hee was Bishop of Portua, and though hee had beene an Hereticke or Schismaticke, though iustly degraded, yet his Episcopall character remained, and his ordinations were effectuall; therefore they dealt iniuriously with him, and his innocencie was sufficiently cleared by miracle. For when his bodie, being found by certaine fishermen in the streame of Tibur, was brought into Saint Peters Church, the very Baron. anno 897. n. 3. ex Luitprando l. 1. c. 8.

                  You must not thinke that they were consecrated againe, but Bar. quo supra. receiued the mysterie of blessing after the manner of their ancestours, which the Authour named the Sacrament of blessing.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  By Sacrament of blessing, is meant the Sacrament of order. For the Bishop which pronounceth the wordes whereby the mysticall blessing, or the spirituall power is giuen, is saide in the fourth Councell of Conc. Cart. 4. c. 2. Bin. tom. 1. pag. 553. Carthage to powre out the blessing.

                  But the meaneth onely, Bar. quo supra. 
                     those solemnities which were accustomed to be vsed in the reconciliation of a Schismaticke or Hereticke.
                  
               
               
                  ORTH.
                  So saith Baronius, but I will proue the contrary. For as you heard before, it was decreed that all which Constantine did in Ecclesiasticall Sacraments and diuine worship should be reiterated, excepting onely Baptisme and confirmation; but what thinke you, did not Pope Stephen and the Romaine Councell, account holy orders an Ecclesiasticall Sacrament?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Yes vndoubtedly.
               
               
                  ORTH.
                  Then vndoubtedly they decreede that the holy orders should be reiterated, which were giuen by Constantine. And therfore if they were onely reconciled, and not reordained, then Pope Stephen did contrary to his own decree; which is most absurde. Wherefore it is a cleare case that Pope Stephen the fourth vsed reordination.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  If he did so, then he was blame worthy. For though Constantine were a Schismaticall Antipope, though of a lay man, hee was suddenly made Bishop, and hudled vp his orders in all hast contrary to the Canons: yet wee cannot deny, but he receiued those orders, and had power in respect of his Episcopall Character to deliuer them vnto others. And seeing his Character was indeleble as wee haue proued, therefore though he had not onely beene a Schismaticke, but also an Hereticke excommunicated and degraded, yet he could not haue lost his power of giuen orders.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  If you continue constant in this opinion, then you must at your leasure bethinke yourselfe, how it may be reconciled with your former allegations out of Pope Innocent, Pope Iohn, and Pope Nicolas: in the meane time it is sufficient for vs to take that you grant.

                  THen to proceed to the rest of the Bishops, consecrated in King Henries daies, in the time of the pretended schisme: were not they capable of the Episcopall function?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Though King Henry abolished the authoritie of the Pope, yet the sacrifice of the Masse continued till the end of his reigne; So we make no doubt, but the Priesthood then in vse, was a sacrificing Priesthood, complete in all points, and consequently capable of the Episcopal Character, notwithstanding the crime of schisme, and heresie.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Then George Browne, Archbishop of Dublin, Edmond Bonner, whom king Henry preferred to Hereford, and thence to London, Thomas Thurlby, Bishop of Westminster, and such like were all capable of the Episcopall office.

                  There is no doubt of it.

                  If these, and such other as returned to the Pope in the dayes of Queene Mary; why not William Barlow, Rowland Lee, Thomas Goodrich, Iohn Hodgeskins? For in King Henries dayes, they were all alike, all Masse Priestes, and yet all opposite to the Popes Supremacy.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  There is one reason of all.

That is, Henry the eighth, when he had diuided his kingdome, from the Church and see Apostolicke, decreed that no man elected Bishop should require the Popes Buls, or mandate Apostolicke, concerning his Consecration, but that he should bring onely the kings letters patents according to which being ordained of three Bishops, with the consent of the Metropolitane, he was enacted to be a true Bishop by the law of Parliament made to the imitation of the ancient Canons, and that no man otherwise Consecrated should be acknowledged for a Bishop.

                  Then it seemeth that all the Bishops in King Henries time were Consecrated by three.

                  How could it be otherwise? you haue heard out of Doctor Sanders, that the Canons required three, the act of Parliament required three, and it appeareth by the 25. Hen. 8. cap. 20. act itselfe, that if any Archbishop or Bishops, did not within twentie dayes next after that the kings letters patents came to their hands, Consecrate the person presented with all due circumstance, they incurred the penaltie of a premunire: therefore we may presume that the practise of those dayes was continually by three.

                  SVrely it was then practised from time to time, as may appeare by recorde, whereof I will giue a taste, beginning from Cranmer.

                  NOw from the Consecrators, let vs proceed to the forme of Consecration,3 and consider whether the ancient Canons, which you approue and vrge, were altered in King Henrtes time.

                  It doth not appeare by the Statute, that there was any alteration: For it was 25. Hen. 8. c. 20. enacted, that the Consecration should be solemnized with all due circumstance. And moreouer, that the Consecrators should giue to the Consecrated, all Benedictions, Ceremonies and things requisite for the same. And surely if there had bene any alteration in things essentiall, Doct. Sand. de schis. l. 
                           •

                     Sanders speaking purposely of this very point, would not haue concealed it. But he saith plainely, It was his will, (speaking of King H. 8) that the Ceremonie and solemne Vnction, should as yet be vsed in Episcopall Consecration, after the maner of the Church. And againe more plainely, Sand de schis. lib. 2. p. 205. 
                     Primo loco sancierunt, vt cum Episcopi, ac Presbyteri Anglicani, ritu ferè Catholico (excepta R. Pontificis obedientia quam omnes obnegabant) ad illud vsque tempus ordinati fuissent, in posterum alia omnino forma ab ipsis praescripta, Ordinationes fierent authoritate à puero Rege, adid accepta. That is, First they decreed, (speaking of K. Edwards time) That whereas the Bishops and Priests of England, had bene ordained euen vnto that time, almost after the Catholicke rite, (excepting
                     
                     the obedience of the Bishop of Rome, which they all dented) hereafter Ordinations should be made altogether after an other forme, by them prescribed, by authoritie which they receiued to that purpose from the King being a childe. But the 1. Mariae sess. 2. cap. 2. Statute of Q. Mary putteth all out of doubt, Enacting, That all such diuine Seruice and Administration of Sacraments, as were most commonly vsed in this Realme of England in the last yeere of King Henry the 8. should be vsed and frequented through the whole Realme of England, and all other the Queenes dominions, and no other, in any other maner, forme or degree. Now the makers of this Statute were perswaded, that holy Order was a Sacrament: therefore holy Orders were ministred in Q. Maries time, as they were in the last yeere of K. Henry. But all good Catholicks will confesse, that in Q. Maries time, the true essentiall forme of Consecration was obserued: Therefore I graunt, that it was also vsed all the time of King Henry.

                  If the persons were capable, and consecrated by a sufficient number of Canonical consecrators, according to the forme of your Church, then you must▪ needs iudge their Consecration effectuall, and them Canonicall Bishops.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Our Church in Q Maries time, did so iudge of them: for most of her old Bishops were made Sand. de Schis. l. 2. pag. 209. 
                     in Schismate Henriciano; Yet they were allowed; and the new (euen Cardinall Poole among the rest) did all deriue their Consecration from the old: yet were they all approued by our holy Father the Bishop of Rome; and by name B. Bonner, and B. Thurlby, to whom he giueth honorable testimony, in his Commission, for the proceeding against Cranmer.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Then, if we can deriue our Bishops from any three in King Henries reigne, before the banishing of the Pope or after, you must acknowledge them to be Canonicall.

                  Or else Bonner and his coequals must lie in the dust, and all the Bishops made in Q. Maries time, must eternally be cancelled out of the Catalogue of Bishops. Hitherto of K. Henries time; Proceed we now to the Bishops in K. Edwards dayes, and consider whether those were Gold or lead.

                  No▪ But you must, there is no remedie And for the more perspicuitie, let vs distinguish them into certaine ranckes. The first of such as were made both Priests and Bishops in K. Henries time, and were continued in King Edwards The second of such as were Priests in K. Henries time, and made Bishops in K. Edwards; To these you may adde a third, of such, (if any such you find) as were made both Priests and Bishops in the dayes of K.

                  PHIL.
                  According to the doctrine of the Catholicke Church holy order is a Sacrament, and euery Sacrament of the newe Law consisteth of things and wordes, as the matter and the forme, which are so certaine and determined of God, that it is not lawfull to change them. Now in ordination the matter is a sensible signe: as for example, imposition of hands, which Bel. de sacram. ord. c. 9. 
                     Bellarmine calleth the matter essentiall.

                  Others of your owne men are of another opinion: for Sal. t. 15. disp. 2. in 2. Tim. 1. 
                     Salmeron the Iesuite hauing proposed the question, bringeth reasons for both sides, but seemeth to incline to the contrary. Fab. Incarn. Scrut. Sacerd. pag. 120. 
                     Fabius Incarnatus asketh this question, how many things are of the substance of order, and answereth that six. But imposition of handes is none of the six. Manual. c. 22. pag. 585. 
                     Nauarrus speaking of imposition of handes, saith: Illa non est de substantia Sacramenti, that is: it is not of the substance of the Sacrament. For which opinion hee alleadgeth Scotus. But if imposition of handes bee the matter of ordination, then Kellison is guiltie of lying and slandering, when hee saith that in King Edwards dayes, the matter of ordination was not vsed. For Sanders himselfe, though a shamelesse fellow, yet confesseth that in the dayes of King Edward, the former lawe, concerning the number of Bishops which should impose handes vpon the ordained was alwayes obserued. A point so cleare, that it might bee iustified by many records: but what neede wee goe to records, seeing it is a plaine case, that the very booke of ordination which was made and established in the dayes of King Edward, commandeth imposition of hands? wherefore if the essentiall matter bee imposition of hands, then I must conclude out of your owne principles, that in King Edwards dayes the essentiall matter was vsed.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  In the ordering of a Deacon, there is not onely imposition of handes, but also the reaching of the Gospels: so in ordering of a Priest, not onely imposition of handes, but also the reaching of the instruments, that is, of the Patten and Challice: and both these Ceremonies are essentiall, as Bell. quo supra.

                  If you call these words the forme of Consecration, then you must acknowledge that not only the matter, but also the right forme of Consecration, was vsed in the dayes of King Edward, (for these words were then vsed while the Bishops imposed hands, as appeareth by the booke:) and consequently you must confesse that Ridley, Hooper, and Ferrar, were rightly ordained Bishops, and moreouer, that Kellison is a notorious slanderer.

                  We thinke that no man can possibly haue the order of a Bishop which hath not the right order of Priesthood, but the Priesthood conferred in King Edwards time was no Priesthood, because they wanted the authority to offer the blessed sacrifice of the Masse, therefore those Priests were not capable of the Episcopall order.

                  I answere first that seeing that King Edward rained but sixe yeeres and fiue moneths, it is likely that most of them which were aduanced in his time to bee Bishops, were before his time in the order of Priesthood. Secondly, if any be produced which were not, yet it shalbe iustified (God willing) when we come to the point, that the order of Priesthood conferred in the dayes of King Edward, Queene Elizabeth, and King Iames is the true ministery of the Gospel, and that your sacrificing Priesthood is sacrilegious, and abominable. In the meane time, you must giue vs leaue to holde that the ministery of the Church of England, is holy in the sight of God, and iustifiable in the sight of man.

                  You know it already, they were all Canonical.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  For the more distinct proceeding, let vs diuide them into two ranckes, the old Bishops, and the new: the old, I cal such as being cōsecrated before her time, were continued in her time; the new, which were Consecrated in her time.

                  All which were allowed for Bishops in Queene Maries time, whether old or new, were Canonicall.

                  The old Bishops were all made in the dayes of K. Henry the eighth, and almost all in those very times, which you brand with imputation of schisme and heresie: when none could bee Consecrated, vnlesse hee did sweare to the king against the Pope. Wherefore seeing you iudged both Consecrators, and Consecrated schismaticall, and hereticall, and yet esteeme them Canonicall, your obiections of schisme and heresie, must eternally bee silenced in the question of Canonicall Bishops. For if these crimes can frustrate a Consecration, then their Consecration was frustrate, and they were no Bishops, or if they were Bishops and Canonicall, then all the Bishops in King Henries time, were likewise Canonicall. Moreouer, some of them whom you so commend▪ were Bishops in King Edwards time, as for example. Thomas Thurlby, whom King Henrie promoted to be Bishop of Westminster, was aduanced by King Edward to the Bishopricke of Norwich, and afterward preferred by Queene Mary to the Bishopricke of Ely, and moreouer to be one of her priuie Councell. Yea some of them had the place of a Bishop in the dayes of Queene Elizabeth; Namely Anthony Kitchin, who in King Henries time was made Bishop of Landaff, kept his dignities and place in the dayes of K. Edward, continued the same all the reigne of Queene Mary, and so till the day of his death, which was in the fift yeere of Queene Elizabeth. Wherefore in iustifying the old Bishops, you iustifie al generally which were Consecrated in King Henries daies, and some which continued in King Edwards and Queene Elizabeths: But now from the old, let vs come to the new.

Then hee perceiued, that the Circumcellions, which were like vnto mad men, were brought into their right wittes againe and made good Catholikes, by being bound as it were with the chaines of imperiall lawes: then he perceiued that others beeing in a spirituall lethargie, were awakened with the seuerity of Imperiall lawes: then hee perceiued, that the Kings of the earth serue Christ, euen by making lawes for Christ. So did that gratious Lady Queene Elizabeth; wherein how mildely and mercifully shee proceeded, you may learne by looking backe to her sister Queene Mary, who was not content to inflict a pecuniary mulct, or a little imprisonment vpon those of the contrary religion, but tied thē to stakes, & burned thē to ashes in flaming fire.

                  FIrst, let vs consider what they deserued, and secondly2 how they were serued. How well they deserued at the

Queenes hands may appeare by their behauiour in three points, concerning the Coronation, Disputation and Excommunication. First when the Queen was to bee crowned, they all conspired together, refusing to performe such solemnitie, as by them of dutie was to bee performed at her Coronation: Owen Oglethorp, Bishop of Carlill onely excepted.

                  Had they not cause to refuse? Sand: de Schis. l. 3. pag. 272. 
                     So soone as shee came to the crowne, shee presently reuealed her minde in religion, both by many other meanes, and especially in that shee straightway silenced the Catholike Preachers: and suffered the heretikes to returne into the kingdome from diuers places, where they were in banishment: Moreouer shee gaue charge to a certaine Bishop about to performe the holy rite before her, and now standing at the Altar attyred in holy vestments, that hee should not eleuate the Consecrated hoaste: whereupon it came to passe, that the Archbishoppe of Yorke, whose office it was (Cardinall Poole Archbishop of Canterbury beeing departed this transitory life) to annoynt and Consecrate her to bee Queene, denied his helpe, and the rest of the Bishops likewise, al sauing one, and he almost the last among them.

                  Your eleuation is referred to adoration, which is Idolatrie; therefore if shee forbad it, as also the Preaching of errour, and commanded the Preaching of truth, shee did but her duty: For as Saint August: contra Chresconium l. 3. c. 51. 
                     Austin saith: Princes may commaund that which is good, and forbid that which is euill within their owne kingdomes, not in ciuill affaires onely, but in matters pertayning to diuine religion also. But if it were so that the Queene therein had committed an errour, if it were so that Popery were true religion; yet shee was the lawfull Queene, the Kingdome descended to her by right of inheritance; the Nobles and commons according to their dutie acknowledged her for Queene, she was proclaimed, by order taken by the Lords and the Archb. of Yorke himselfe, then Lord Chancelour of England; what reason then had the Bishops to deny her that solemnity, which was neuer denied to any of her noble progenitours? If she had pulled the Miters from their heades, for refusing to set the Diademe vpon her head, had not this beene a iust reward for a due desert? Hitherto of the first point, that is, the Coronation.
                  SEcondly, it was the Queenes pleasure, that there should be a solemne3 disputation betweene the Popish Bishops, or some other Champions appointed by them on the one part, and other learned diuines of our religion, on the other part; but the Bishops with one accord most obstinately refused the incounter.

                  You tell vs of Popes, Councels, and Fathers, but I heare no mention at all of the Scripture: truly Philodox, wee builde not our faith vpon Popes nor Councels, nor Fathers, but onely vpon the blessed and sacred word of God, registred in the writings of the Apostles and Prophets. but for the better vnderstanding of this word, wee make honourable account of ancient Councels and Fathers, yet so that wee put an infinite difference

betweene them and the word of the liuing God. For the word of God is infallible; it can neither deceiue, nor bee deceiued; but the word of man is subiect to errour: therefore wee must trie all things, and holde that which is good, and the touchstone of all is the word of God. Neither are wee afraid of the Councels and Fathers: you beare the world in hand that all make for you, but vpon manifold and iust experience it prooueth otherwise. As for the Popes, if you meane the ancient Bishops of Rome, wee regard them with reuerence, and if their true writings were extant, wee would willingly embrace them: but as for your late Popes, wee litle respect them. Moreouer, if your Bishops had for them the former definitions of Fathers and Councels, they might more easily haue conuinced their aduersaries in disputation; this should haue beene a spurre vnto them, and not a bridle.

                  These are figures of rehetoricke, wherewith you vse to embellish your speeches, as it were with precious stones. Whosoeuer will hold with the Pope, is presently with you a good Catholicke and a very learned man; but let him bee neuer so wise, learned, and iudicious, if hee loue God, his Prince and countrey better then the Pope, hee shall bee reproached with ignorance and heresie; as appeareth in that honourable personage Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the great Seale of England, a man famous for wisdome pietie, and the zeale of Gods glory. But why doe you blemish him? because hee had the fauour of a gracious Prince? you might haue learned of Prou. 22. 11. Salomon: Hee that loueth purenesse of heart, for the grace of his lippes the King shall bee his friend? can you blame him, for that hee was designed by his Soueraigne, to bee a moderatour at the disputation? you should rather haue considered the Queenes great mildenesse, and gracious proceeding, in that shee vouchsafed to ioyne with him an assistant (as Sanders confesseth) one of your owne Religion, a man of eminent note in Church and common wealth,

who stoode not for a cipher, or for fashion sake, but was armed with authoritie, and had power to prouide that the Papistes should haue full libertie to speake their mindes before that great and honourable assembly.

                     The Protestants would haue had them to dispute vpon such Articles proposed for questions, as seemed to haue a greater shewe of proofe in the Scriptures for the Heretickes; as of the Communion vnder both kindes, of publique prayers to bee had in the vulgar tongue, and such like.

                  In the publique reformation of a Church, the first thing to be considered, is the due ordering of diuine seruice, and Sacraments: therefore the questions were chosen with singular discretion; one concerning the prayers, whether they should bee in the vulgar tongue, another concerning the Lords Supper, whether it should bee ministred in both kindes. In both which points you had done great iniurie to the people of God. But you say

that the Protestants made choise of such questions as seemed to haue a greater shew of proofe in the Scripture: and haue we, thinke you, but a seeming shew of proofe, & no sound substantial proofe indeed? If the Bishops had bin of this opinion, it should rather haue incouraged them to the incounter, then haue caused them to flie the field. Is the holy Scripture for vs in these questions onely? if the disputation had beene about the worshipping of images, inuocations of Saints, iustification by faith, and such like, could not wee haue produced as pregnant proofes out of the Scriptures for these, as for the former? but now one may lay his finger vpon your pulse, and easily discerne the trembling of your heart. For this speech which you haue borrowed from Sanders, doth intimate vnto vs, that the Bishops refused to dispute, because they were not able to maintaine their opinions by the Scriptures.

                     Catholicos Antistites & Ecclesiarum rectores in vincula coniecit, vbi multi diuturno languore & tristitia confecti, extremum vitae diem misere finierunt: That is, She laid in chaines the Catholicke Bishops and gouernours of Churches, where many of them wasted with long languishment, and sorrow, ended their life miserably.

                  Thirteene of these Bishops are named by Pag. 286. 
                     Sanders, to which we may adde Pates of Worcester, so the whole number is fourteene, as Cardinall Defence of Cath. pag. 45. 
                     Allen hath it. Now of these fourteene, foure were of the Prouince of Yorke, and 10. of Cant. In the Prouince of Yorke, to begin with N. Heath Archb. of that see, he being L. Chauncelour of Eng. made open declaration in Parliament, of Q. Maries death, and the vndoubted title of the Lady Elizabeth: Whereupon▪ she was presently proclaimed Queene. For which loyalty he was honorably regarded, neuer cōmitted to prison or custody, but permitted to liue at his owne liberty, (vpon some lands which he had purchased) in quietnes and ease, and last of all dying full of yeeres, was suffered to bequeath his substance by will & testament. From Yorke, let vs go to Durham, the Bishop wherof Cut. Tonstal, after his depriuation, kept at Lambeth, with Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, where he liued, (so long as he liued) with comfort, and being 85. yeeres old, yeelded to nature, and was honourably buried. The third was Owen Oglethorp Bishop of Carlill, who as he had shewed himselfe more dutiful then the rest, in the Coronation of the Queene: so there is no doubt but he was accordingly respected: who being neither in prison nor custody, shortly after paid his debt to nature, and dyed of an apoplexy. The last of these foure was Cutbert Scot, Bishop of Chester, who slipped

away beyond the seas, where he liued in voluntary banishment. From the Prouince of Yorke, let vs come to the Prouince of Canterbury: where we find that Iohn white Bishop of Winchester, saluted the prison, though not for any of the reasons alleadged by Sanders, but for an vndutifull Sermon▪ yet afterward he was set at liberty, and died out of prison. Thomas Thurlby Bishop of Ely, hauing indured a time of imprisonment, neither very sharpe nor very long, was permitted to liue in the Archbishoppes house, where till the day of his death, (that is, for tenne yeeres) hee was intreated so kindly, that he is supposed to haue taken more pleasure in this time of his restraint, then euer he did before, in the middest and fullest streame of his highest honours. Gilbert Borne Bishop of Bath was committed to the custody of Master Carew, his olde acquaintance, Deane of Exeter. Iames Turberuill Bishop of Exeter enioyed a priuate life a long time, liuing and dying in liberty. Dauid Pole, Bishop of Peterborrow, being alwayes vsed with courtesie, and vsing his liberty, dyed in his owne house in a ripe age. Neither doe I finde that Bayne Bishop of Lichfield, was in durance, who dyed soone after of the stone. Richard Pates Bishop of Worcester, and Thomas Goldwell of Saint Asaph, departed the kingdome, not by constraint of law, but of their owne accord. The Bishop of Lincolne Thomas Watson, a churlish and froward man, liued after his depriuation 24. yeeres, first at more libertie in the houses of the Bishoppes of Ely and Rochester, but afterward when your Emissaries from Rome, did trouble the Church, he was kept somewhat more streightly in the Ile of Ely. The last of all is Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, who in Queene Maries time was the principall Butcher, and therefore so odious to the people, that as our learned Tort Torti▪ pag. 147. Bishop hath of late truely deliuered, It was not safe for him to goe abroad, least the people should haue stoned him to death: and he indeed liued, and dyed in prison, but where, if you had seene him (to vse the wordes of our Reuerend Ibidem. Bishop) You would not haue sayd, that he had beene pined, or starued with hunger, hee liued daintily, there were Gardens and Orchards, if it pleased him to walke: Finally this prison was nothing like a prison, but onely that (therein) he was confined. Thus it appeareth, that of the 14. some were neuer confined at all; Others confined onely to the custody of their friends, but neuer saluted the prison: others saluted it, but were soone released; and those which stayed longest in prison, yet were not layed in fetters, as impious Pius Quintus hath blazed to the world. All these 14. did liue euen till the glasse of Nature was fully runne and expired, and some of them were intertained at the Tables of Bishops, Ibidem.

                  Q. Athalia? No Queene sir, by your leaue: Ioas the true heire of the kingdome was then aliue, and he was the true King by right of inheritance: therefore she was no Queene▪ but a wicked vsurper; Your Pag 92. Defence of Catholicks might teach you so much, which calleth her, A pretenced Queene, and saith, That she vsurped the kingdome. Yet behold with what blindnesse and giddines they are stricken, which traiterously oppose themselues against their Prince and countrey. Cardinall Ibidem. 
                     Allen is not ashamed to bring the example of Iehoiada deposing Athalia, that vsurping and pretenced Queene, to proue that the Pope hath authoritie to depose, lawfull Princes. Neither did Iehoiada this, as being high Priest, but whatsoeuer he did in this case, he might haue done it, though he had not bene high Priest: For Iehosheba his wife was 2. Chron. 22. 11. 
                     daughter to king Iehoram, and sister to king Ahazia, who was father to Ioas, and consequently she was aunt to King Ioas; So Iehoiada her husband, was of the next alliance that the yong King had: Yea, and when Athalia like a bloodie Tyger Verse 10. 
                     murthered the kings seed, Iehosheba the wife of Iehoiada, conueyed away her nephew Ioas out of the middest of the kings sonnes, which were massacred, Verse 11.

                     Verse 12. 6. yeeres in the House of the Lord. So Iehoiada by Gods prouidence, was made Protector of the Kings person: yea, and when the time came wherein he thought fit to disclose him, he first acquainted the 2. Chron. 23. 2. 
                     Fathers of Israel, and the Captaines, and so proceeded with their consent: Therefore what did hee herein, but protect the person, age, innocencie, and title of his Lord and Soueraigne▪ whereto he was bound by the Law▪ of Nature, and Nations? Therefore when you bring this to proue the Popes Supremacie, you mistake the matter: you cannot shew vs in Scripture, where euer a Priest deposed a lawfull Prince. The Kings of Israel

were all of them idolaters, and so were 14. of the Kings of Iuda, yet not one Priest or Prophet did so much as euer offer to depose any one of them; but we shew you in Scripture this plaine example, where Salomon the Prince, remoued Abiathar the lawfull Priest.

If Salomon had no authoritie to depose Abtathar, then there must needs be a nullitie in the Deposition. For how can any Iudiciall action be of validitie, when there is no authoritie in the Agent?

Orders, the chiefe of each Order was called Princeps Sacerdotum, The Prince of the Priests, or high Priest; Secondly, there was a Colledge of 72. Seniours, which was called Synedrin, the first or chiefe whereof was also called, The Prince of the Priests, or high Priest. Thirdly, it is taken, both most properly, and most vsually, for him that had the first and chiefest place of all, to whom the other Princes of the Priests were subiect. Now Baronius thinketh that S. Luke called Annas an high Priest, because he was both the Prince and highest of his Order, and also the Prince and highest of the Synedrin, but Caiaphas in his iudgement was called high Priest, because he was simply and absolutely highest of all: in which sence there can be but one high Priest at once, nor euer was; Baron.

                  If there could be but one high Priest at one time, and Abiathar (notwithstanding that hee was put from the possession) still retained the true right, title, and interest to be high Priest, then Sadok was not a lawfull high Priest, but an intruder vpon another mans right: what say you to this?

                  If Sadok were no intruder, but a lawfull high Priest, then Abiathar ceased to bee high Priest, for you say there could not bee two at once. If Abiathar ceased to bee high Priest, then the place was lawfully voide: but how was it void? Not by death, for Abiathar was still aliue; not by resignation

or voluntary cessation, for wee finde no such matter. How then? no other reason can with reason bee imagined, but onely because h

For if the deposer had no authority, then could not the deposition bee lawfull; wherefore as you confesse that Sadok was lawfull high Priest, so you must likewise confesse, that Salomon in casting out Abiathar, and placing Sadok had lawfull authority.

Or who should draw the sword of iustice against malefactors, but he that beareth not the sword in vaine, that is, the King by the power, and authoritie of a King? Concerning Ioab 1. Kin▪ 2. 29.

Now to come to Abiathar; his offence against the King was the same, and the Scripture ascribeth the punishment in the same tenour of wordes vnto the king: 1. King. 2. 26. 
                     Then the King said vnto Abiathar the Priest: euen the king, who in the former verse commaunded Adonias to bee slaine; that is, the King, as a King: which may appeare further by that which hee said, Goe to Anathoth to thy owne fields, in which words hee confineth him, which is the action of a King. And againe, thou art worthy of death, but I will not this day kill thee, because thou barest the Arke of the Lord God before Dauid my Father: and because thou hast suffered in all things wherein my Father hath beene afflicted. In which wordes hee granteth life, to one that had deserued death: and who could doe this, but a King? Vers. 27. 
                     So Salomon cast out Abiathar from being high Priest vnto the Lord: Where wee see death changed into depriuation. All which doe argue the power of a King: yea it is said, Vers. 35. 
                     that the King put Benaiah the sonne
                     
                     of Iehoiada in the roume of Ioab ouer the hoast; which vndoubtedly belonged vnto the King, as hee was King: and it followeth immediately in the same verse; and the King set Sadok the Priest in the roume of Abiathar. Thus you see that the whole course of Scripture ascribeth it to the King, as a King: and why should you thinke otherwise?

If Kings had no authoritie, then they should not haue enioyned, appointed, commaunded, and punished; but onely haue aduised, admonished, and exhorted them. If Priestes had any such priuiledge, it is strange, that in all the storie of the olde Testament, wee finde not one Priest, once pleading his priuiledge. If they submitted themselues when their conscience tolde them that they had offended, yet why did they not plead their immunitie, when they were iniuriously handled? 2. Chr. 24. 21. 
                     Zacharias the Priest was slaine, at the commandement of the King, and yet neuer mentioned any priuiledge: When 1▪ Sam. 22. 18. 
                     Saul slew Abimelech, and aboue eightie Priestes which wore a linnen Ephod, Abimelech declared his innocency, and acknowledged the Kings iurisdiction ouer him, by calling the King his Lord, and himselfe the Kings Verse 12. 15. 
                     seruant, but spoke not a word of any priuiledge. Therefore all the world may see that there was no such matter, these are but fictions of idle braines; wherefore we may truly conclude, that the tribe of Leui was not exempted from secular iurisdiction, but the King might conuent, command, reprooue, and punish them, and yet not transgresse the law of God.

                     Lodowicke; and you shall see, that they practised as much, as euer we ascribed to the Queene in this oath. When the Councell of Ephesus by the packing of Dioscorus, had allowed the

cursed opinion of Eutyches, and deposed Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, Pope Leo vpon this occasion wrote thus vnto the Emperour Theodosius; 
                     Leo Epist. 24. 
                     Behold, most Christian and reuerend Emperour, I, with the rest of my fellow Bishops, make supplication vnto you, That all things may stand in the same state, in which they were before any of these Iudgements, vntill a greater number of Bishops may be gathered out of the whole world. Who made this supplication? Pope Leo, a holy and learned Pope. To whom? To the Emperour Theodosius. For what? That the Emperour would command; not intreat, but command: So this is an action of Royall authoritie. What should he command? That all things might stand in their former state. What things meaneth he? The highest mysteries of Religion, concerning the Natures and person of Christ. But what is it to stand in the former state? That it might be lawfull for all men, so to iudge and speake of these holy Mysteries, as they did before the springing vp of the Eutychian Heresie: for then they held the Trueth, according to the Apostolicke faith. And this he beseecheth the Emperour to command, notwithstanding the contrary determination of the Councell of Ephesus. 
                     Leo Epist. 43. 
                     The second Councell of Ephesus, which apparantly subuerted the faith, cannot rightly bee called a Councell, which your Highnes for very loue to the Trueth, will make voyd by your Decree to the contrary, most glorious Emperour. I therefore earnestly request and beseech your Maiestie by our Lord Iesus Christ, the founder and guider of your Kingdome, That in this Councell (of Chalcedon) which is presently to be kept, you will not suffer the Faith to be called in question, which our blessed Fathers preached, being deliuered vnto them from the Apostles; Neither permit such things as haue bene long since condemned by them, to be freshly reuiued againe, but that you will rather command, That the Constitutions of the ancient Nicene Councell may stand in force, the interpretation of Hereticks being remooued. Here the Pope ascribeth to the Emperour power to ratifie and establish those Councels, which are according to the Scripture, and to disanull those whose determinations are contrary to the Scripture; Yea, he acknowledgeth, that the Emperour hath authoritie to inhibite and restraine Generall Councels, that they call not the Trueth of God in question. Which the Emperour Martian practised, entring the Councell of Chalcedon in his owne person, and Mart. Imper. orat. in Conc. Chalced. act. 1. Bin. t. 2. p. 4. 
                     forbidding the Bishops to auouch any thing concerning the birth of our Sauiour, otherwise then was contained in the Nicene Creed. Moreouer, when the Councell of Chalcedon was concluded, Pope Leo Epist. 59. 
                     Leo wrote thus againe to the Emperour; Because I must by all meanes obey your pietie and most Religious will, I haue willingly giuen my consenting sentence to those Synodall Constitutions, which concerning the confirmation of the Catholicke faith, and condemnation of Hereticks, pleased me very well. The Emperour required the Pope to subscribe; And he cheerefully did so, Protesting that for his part, he must by all meanes obey the Princes will in those cases. Now tell me whether the Pope did not acknowledge the Emperour, and the Emperour shew himselfe to be Supreame gouernour ouer all persons, euen in causes Ecclesiasticall?
                  
                  AS the Emperour Martian did practise this Supremacie, so the Emperour4.

                        uis vobis committente, that is, The diuine and gracius prouidence of God, committing vnto you the gouernment of the Ecclesiasticall ship. Where you see that he speaketh of the Ecclesiasticall ship.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  To whom was the gouernment of the ship committed? Vobis, to you: that is, to the Bishops: what is this to the Emperour?
               
               
                  ORTH.
                  Indeed, Binius hath Vobis; but it should be Nobis, which may appeare, first, because the Emperor himself in the words shortly after following in Binius, said, Nos proratione datae nobis in Ecclesiasticis rebus potestatis, non tacebimus, that is, We in regard of the power giuen vnto vs in Ecclesiasticall matters will not hold our peace. Where it is cleare that the Emperor did think himselfe to haue power giuen him from God, not only in matters ciuil, but also in Ecclesiasticall. Therefore when the Emperor said, That the diuine prouidence had committed vnto him the gouernment of the vniuersall ship, hee must needs be vnderstood as well of causes Ecclesiasticall as ciuill. Which may yet appeare further by the Emperors words, as they are in Surtus immediatly following in the same sentence; Omne studium arripuimus & ante publicas curas Ecclesiasticas dissoluere, i. When the diuine prouidence had committed vnto vs the gouernment of the vniuersall ship, we vsed all diligence to dispatch Ecclesiasticall cares, before the publike affaires of the Commonwealth. So if Surius wilbe iudged by his owne Edition, and giue the Emperour leaue to expound himselfe; then Ecclesiasticall affaires must be comprehended in the gouernment of the Vniuersall ship. Wherfore though Surius would raze out the word Ecclesiasticall, and Binius foist in Vobis instead of Nobis, yet whether we compare either of them with himselfe, or each of them with other, it is euident that the Emperor Basil, did challenge the gouernement of the vniuersal ship, both Ecclesiastical and Ciuil, and that in a generall Councell, no man resisting him. What doth this differ from Supreme gouernour as it is vsed in the Church of England?
                  AS Basill did challenge this gouernment, no man resisting; so sundry Synods6 haue giuen the like to Princes not refusing it. There was a Councell holden at Cont. M

In the time of the Emperour Charles the great, and Pope Leo the third, the Synodall acts whereof Binius professeth that he compared with a manuscript sent him out of the Emperours library at Vienna. Now the Bishops assembled in this Synode, begin thus. In the Name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. To the most glorious and most Christian Emperour Carolus Augustus, gouernour of the true religion, and defender of the holy Church of God, &c. And a little after, We giue thanks to God the Father Almighty, because hee hath granted vnto his holy Church a gouernor so godly &c.

                     Chrysostome saith, that the Emperor hath no peere vpon earth, and calleth him the head and crowne of all men vpon earth. If he be next vnto God, and inferiour only to God; If none be aboue him but God onlie; If he haue no peere vpon earth, as being the head and crowne of all men vpon earth; then must hee needs bee the supreme gouernour vpon earth, according to the iudgement of the fathers. This is agreeable to the Scripture, which testifieth, that most godly kings commanded both Priests and high Priests, euen in cases of religion as was before declared. Neither is this authority taken away in the New Testament, but continueth the very same; As may appeare by Saint Paul, who lifteth vp his voice like a trumpet, proclayming, Rom. 13. 1. 
                     Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers, which words euery soule comprehend all persons, both Ecclesiasticall and Temporal, yea though they were Euangelists, Prophets or Apostles, as Saint Chrysostome doth truly expound them. If euery soule be subiect to the higher powers, then the Prince is superiour to all, and consequently supreme within his owne dominions. But why doe I stay so long vpon this point, which hath beene of late so learnedly and plentifully handled, that to say any more were but to cast water into the sea, or to light a candle at noone day?

                  HOw vnreasonable it is, may appeare by the absurdities which follow6 thereupon, for if the Prince be supreme gouernour in causes spiritual, then he may command what religion he list, and we must obey him.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Not so; for he is supreme gouernour in causes temporal, yet he may not command a man to beare false witnesse, or to condemne the innocent as Iesabell did; or if he should, we must rather obey God then man; so in cases of religion Nabuchodonosor had no warrant to erect his image, nor Ieroboam, to set vp his golden calues. For the king, as king, is supreme vnder

God, not against God, to commaund for truth, not against truth; And if hee shall command vngodly things, we may not performe obedience, but submit our selues to his punishments with patience.

                  ORTHOD.
                  Here are two things to be considered. First the princely power and authority; Secondly the ability rightly to vse and exercise the same. The princely power and authority is giuen immediatly frō God, both vnto Christian Princes, and also vnto Ethnickes which are guided only by the light & law of nature, and by constitutions thence deduced by the wit of man. For this is true in all; Pro. 8. 15. 
                     By me kings raigne; And Dan. 2. 37. 
                     Daniell said to Nabuchodonosor, O king thou art a king of kings, for the God of Heauen hath giuen vnto thee a kingdome, & power, and strength, and glory. But the ability rightly to vse and exercise this authority, by refering it to the true end, that is, the glory of God (for all our riuers should run into that Ocean) & the eternall good of the subiects, is communicated from the Lord aboue, onely to such as know him in Christ Iesus, and are guided by his grace. The fountaine therefore of al power is God himselfe;

as the Apostle witnesseth saying, Rom. 13. 1. 
                     there is no power but of God. To which purpose it is well said of Saint De ciuit. Dei l. 5. c. 21. 
                     Austin. Qui dedit Mario, ipse & Caesari; qui Augusto, ipse & Neroni; qui Vespasiano vel patri vel filio suauissimis imperatoribus, ipse & Domitiano crudelissimo: & ne per singulos ire necesse sit, qui Constantino Christiano, ipse Apostatae Iuliano. i. He that gaue it to Mar
                        ••
                     s, gaue it to Caesar, hee that gaue it to Augustus, gaue it to Nero, he that gaue it to Vespasian the Father, or his sonne, most sweete Emperours, gaue it also to Domitian the most cruell. And that I should not neede to recken vp the rest in particular; hee that gaue it to Constantine the Christian, gaue it also to Iulian the Apostata. But though domination and power were in the law of nature, yet the right vse of it is not from nature but from grace. A Prince, as a Prince, be he good or bad, Christian or Pagan, in respect of his princely calling hath sufficient power and authoritie to gouerne his people according to the will of God. And it is his dutie so to doe. Esai. 45. 2. 3. 
                     The Lord said vnto Cyrus, I will goe before thee and make the crooked streight; I will breake the brasen doores, and burst the Iron barres. And I will giue thee the treasures of darkenesse, and the things hid in secret places, that thou maiest know that I am the Lord. Vpon which wordes Saint Ierom noteth, that God giueth kingdomes vnto wicked men, not that they should abuse them, but as for other reasons, so for this, that being inuited by his bountie, they should bee conuerted from their sinnes. So it is their dutie to serue God, not onely as they are men, but as they are Kings. And Kings (saith Saint Aust. ep. 50. 
                     Austin) doe in this serue God as Kings, when they doe those things to serue him which none but Kings can doe. But what is that? It may appeare by these wordes; Epist. 48. 
                     Seruiant reges terrae Christo, etiam leges ferendo pro Christo. i. Let the Kings of the earth serue Christ euen by making lawes for Christ. For though the immediate end of humane societes be peace and prosperitie, yet the last end of all, and most principally to bee respected is the glory of God, and eternall happinesse. For which purpose it is the dutie of all subiects to pray for their Prince, though hee bee a Pagan, that

                      But though euery Prince, in that hee is a Prince, hath authoritie to serue God as a Prince, yet for the due execution thereof there is required grace. Authoritie is in a Pagan; the due execution requireth a Christian. The King of Niniuie had authoritie long before, to proclaime a fast; Nabuchodonosor had authoritie to commaund, that all nations and languages should worship the God of Daniel: but they put it not in execution till God touched their hearts: and when they put it in execution, it was not by any new authoritie, but by vertue of their former Princely power heretofore abused, but now vsed rightly by direction of Gods Spirit, and assistance of his grace. The truth of which answere that you may see in another glasse, let vs a little remooue our speech from the Prince to the Priest: I demande therefore, if the Priestes, the sonnes of Aaron were not the messengers of the Lord of hosts?

This is that which Caluin calleth blasphemie and sacriledge, and so will we. But if Caluin had beene truely informed that nothing had beene meant by this title, but to exclude the Pope, and to acknowledge the kings lawfull authoritie ouer his owne subiects, not in diuising new Articles of faith, or coyning new formes of religion, as Ieroboam did his calues, but in maintaining that faith and religion which God had commanded; without all question Caluin had neuer misliked it. In this sense, and no other, that title was giuen him. Neither did the king take it otherwise, for ought that we can learne.

Christian Emperours; as hath beene declared, where it was as lawfull for the Parliament to exact an oath in behalfe of the Prince against the Pope, as it was for Iehoiada, to exact an 2.

But the English Powder-plot, doeth so farre exceed the French Massacre, that there is no degree of comparison; this cannot be patternd, or paraleld.

Wherefore, if you will not beleeue vs disputing for Religion, yet beleeue God himselfe, with his owne right hand, and with his holy arme defending our Prince and State, our Church and Ministerie, and that very

For what Archbishop was either present at his Consecration, or consenting vnto it? Cardinall Poole then late Archbishop of Canterbury was dead, and Parker elected into his place. Nicholas Heath then last Archbishop of Yorke was deposed. Indeed there was a certaine

But hee (good man) would by no meanes be brought to lay holy hands vpon heretikes, neither to be partaker of other mens sinnes. Wherefore hauing neither Archbishop of their owne religion, nor being able to procure any other, the Consecration was performed without a Metropolitane, cleane contrary to the lawes of England.

                  You neede not doubt of it. For first, the Bishops to whom the letters patents were directed, had reason to set their handes cheerefully to so good a worke, so much tending to the aduancing of the true Religion which they all imbraced, and for which all of them except one, had

beene in exile. Secondly, how durst they doe otherwise, seeing it was enacted by a statute made in the 25. yeare of King Cap. 20. 
                     Henry 8. and still in force, that if any Archbishop or Bishop within the Kings dominions after any such election, nomination▪ or presentation signified vnto them by the Kings letters patents, should refuse and not confirme, inuest, and consecrate with all due circumstance within twentie dayes after that the Kings letters patents of such signification or presentation should come to their hands, then hee or they, so offending, should runne in the dangers; paines and penalties of the statute of prouision and premunire made in the twentie fiue yeare of the raigne of king Edward the third, and in the sixteenth of king Richard the second.

Which act they signified in a Synodall Epistle, to the Church of Alexandria, in this manner. Athanas. Apol. 2. Bin. t. 1. p. 444. 
                     We would haue you to know that Gregory, being made Bishop vnlawfully, by heretickes, and brought by them into your citie is deposed from his Bishopricke by the whole Synode, although in very deed hee was neuer Bishop, therfore farewell, and receiue your Bishop Athanasius. Thus you see that though Athanasius fled away in time of persecution, though he were deposed by a Councel, and another chosen in his place, by another Councell, with the consent of the Emperour; yet for all this▪ he is iudged to be the true Bishop of Alexandria, and Gregory neuer to haue beene the Bishop thereof. The like is to be said of Marcellus, Bishop of Ancyra, Asclepas Bishop of Gaza, Paulus Bishop of Constantinople and others, who were persecuted for the Catholicke Faith, as well as Athanasius. Wherefore if you wil conforme your iudgement to the Councell of Sardica, you must confesse that such as in King Edwards time were lawfully possessed of Bishoprickes (though in Queene Maries time being persecuted in one citie, they fled into another) did still retaine the titles of true Bishops, and that those which inuaded their Churches, were intruders and vsurpers. Thus it appeareth, that as Athanasius, and the rest returning from exile, might ordaine and doe, all such things as belonged to their Episcopall Office, euen so Bishop Barlow, Bishop Couerdale, and the rest returning from exile, might likewise ordaine, and iustifie their proceedings in their Episcopall function.

                  You vse to finde fault with the Popes dispensations, and will you your selues in an act of Parliament affirme that the Queene dispensed with all causes or doubts of any imperfection, or dissabilitie, and that in a matter of holie Orders?

                  The Pope taketh vpon him to dispense against the law of God, (as for example, That a brother may marrie his brothers wife;) So did not Queene Elizabeth, but onelie with trespasses against her owne lawes, not in essentiall points of ordination, but onelie in accidentall; not in substance but in circumstance. Neither did she giue them leaue to make any voluntarie violatiō of the law, but only dispensed with such omission as

                     necessity it selfe should require, as may appeare by the said letters patents. And it pleased the Almighty so to dispose that al things were performed in most exquisite manner; yet the Papists, (such was their hatred against the Clergie) did blaze abroad the contrarie: Whereupon the high Court of Parliament assembled in the eight yeere of that famous Queene, hauing deepelie considered and pondered all things, pronounced, that their speeches were Slanderous not grounded vpon any iust matter, or cause. For Gods name bee blessed, all things were done honestlie, and in order, euen from her first comming to the crowne.

                     Iosias assembled the ancients of Iuda and Ierusalem to make a Couenant with their God: so Queene Elizabeth assembled her high Court of Parliament for the same purpose. But as when Nehemias went about reformation, the Neh. 13. 28 Priests and Neh. 6. 12 Prophets which should haue bin the principall helpers, were principal hinderers; so it came to passe in that Parliament, that whereas the Prince, and Barons, and the Commons were great instruments of Gods glorie; the Popish Bishops sought by all meanes the glory of their holie father the Pope. Notwithstanding God in his mercy gaue a blessing, so that the truth preuailed. And as 2. Kin. 11. 4.

                  The records alleadged, are of such high credit and reputation, that they cannot possibly be infringed. As for the maine point whereupon all the rest dependeth, that is, the Consecration of Archbishop Parker, as it was solemnly performed in a great assembly, so it was published in print in his owne time, when all things were in fresh memorie. And though some of his spitefull and bitter enemies did then scornefully coment vpon his life, yet the trueth of this fact they neuer called in question.

                  Truely (Philodox) that which a man wisheth, hee is willing to beleeue, & the mind sophisticate with malice is ready vpon euery light occasion to imagine the worst, yea and somtimes to blaze that for certaine which hath neither shew nor shadow of truth. Yet these vaine surmises you receiue for oracles, and deliuer one to another by the holy hand of tradition, wherein you glory as in an vnanswerable argument. So did your fellowes at Framlingham: so did Hart in the conference with Doctour Rainolds: but when hee had heard his answere, iustifying our Bishops by authentical records, Doct. Reinolds in his letter to M. Thomas Barker of Monck Soham in Suffolke, the originall wherof is in my hāds, and the same Doctour of godly memory did sometimes relate the same vnto myselfe. 
                     he would needes haue that whole point left out of the conference, saying he would not presse him with it, and confessed, hee thought that no such thing could haue beene shewed, and that himselfe had beene borne in hand otherwise. Now (Philodox) as he was deluded, so are you: but as he receiued satisfaction, so I hope will you.

                  Betweene the Regall and Episcopall there are many differences; but it shall bee sufficient for our present purpose to obserue these two: first the Episcopall Iurisdiction is onely spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall: but the Regall is both Ecclesiasticall and temporall. Secondly, the King doth gouerne Ecclesiasticall affaires, not Ecclesiastically but regally, that is, with a soueraigne authoritie outwardly coercitiue with temporall punishments: The Bishop handleth Ecclesiasticall matters in Ecclesiasticall manner. For hee is enabled by himselfe, and ex officio ordinario, not onely to minister the word and Sacraments, but also to performe other holy and eminent actions: as for example, to ordaine Ministers, and to inflict spirituall censures vpon the offendours, namely the sentence of excommunication, and againe, to absolue and restore them to the Communion of Saints: Which sacred offices Nos Principi censurae potestatem non

                     our Church ascribeth not vnto the person of the Prince, neither did our Kings or Queenes euer practise them. For regall Iurisdiction consisteth not in a ministeriall power, nor personall performance of such things, but in an outward supreame commanding authoritie, as was Lib. 3. c. 3. before declared out of the admonition annexed to the Queenes iniunctions, an acte of Parliament, and the Articles of Religion: Wherefore as it was not lawfull for the Kings of Iudah to take vpon them the Priestly office, to 2. Chron. 26. 18. 
                     burne incense, or offer sacrifice, and yet they might command the Priestes euen in these things to doe

their dutie as it was prooued Lib. 3. c. 2. before by many examples; so it belongeth not to the Prince to minister the word and Sacraments, to ordaine, or excommunicate: yet being supreame gouernour ouer all persons, and in all causes within his owne dominions, hee may make lawes, and command that these things bee done by such persons, and in such manner as is agreeable to the blessed will of God. Nouel▪ Const. 123. 
                     Iustinian made a lawe that no Bishops nor Priestes should separate any man from the holy Communion before the cause were declared, for which the holy Canons command him so to doe; inacting there-withall that if any were otherwise excommunicated, he should be absolued by a greater Priest, and restored to the Communion of Saints. When Maximus Bishop of Salonae, had incurred Ecclesiasticall censures, Pope Gregory the Great did release them, Greg. Epist. l. 5. c. 25.

When Paulus Samosatenus was excommunicate and deposed, in the Councell of Antioch, he did notwithstanding hold his Church, and chaire by violence; whereupon the Councell knowing that of themselues, they could proceed no further, were forced to seeke the aide of Aurelian the Emperour, by whose commandement he was

                  Heere wee must consider the matters handled in the consistories of Bishops, and the manner. The matters originally, and naturally

belonging to those Courts, are onely such as are originally and naturally Ecclesiasticall: the manner to ratifie their iudgements, is not properly vnder any corporall mulct, but onely by spirituall censures, as suspension excommunication and such like. In both which respects, the Iurisdiction of Bishops hath beene much inlarged by the fauour and indulgence of Christian Princes. Concerning the matter; Constantine the Great, gaue libertie to Clerkes to

                     As though they had beene pronounced by the Emperour himselfe. Now all the Iurisdiction which Bishops haue in Ciuill Causes is meerely from the Prince. Concerning the manner, it seemeth sometimes expedient to annex coactiue power to the Episcopall office, both for the honour of Prelacie, and also to make their spirituall censures the more regarded, which also without controuersie, must bee acknowledged to proceede from the Prince. For as the Lord hath compacted the light into the body of the Sunne, that thence it might be communicated to Moone and Starres: So hee hath put all ciuill and coactiue Iurisdiction, into the person of the Prince, from whom as from a glorious Sunne or fountaine, all other inferiour lampes doe borrow their light. But if wee speake of that Episcopall Iurisdiction, which both in respect of matter and manner, is meerely spirituall; the immediate fountaine of it is God himselfe; as our most learned and religious King, with his royall Penne, hath thus witnessed to the world.

                     That Bishops ought to bee in the Church, I euer maintained it as an Apostolicke institution, and so the ordinance of God, contrary to the Puritanes, and likewise to Bellarmine, who denyeth that Bishops haue their Iurisdiction immediately from God. If his Maiesties iudgement bee contrary to Bellarmines who holdeth the negatiue, then his Princely wisedome embraceth the affirmatiue, to wit, that Bishops haue their Iurisdiction (meerely spirituall) immediately from God. Notwithstanding, for so much as they exercise the same in a Christian Common wealth, at the holy direction and command, and vnder the gracious protection of a religious King, within the kings dominions, vpon the Kings subiects, according to the Canons and statutes, established by the Kings authoritie, wee may iustly call those Courts the Kings Ecclesiasticall Courts, and the Archbishops, and Bishops the kings Ecclesiasticall iudges. Wherefore, though this spirituall power in regard of it selfe be immediately from God, yet in these respects it may rightly be said to be deriued from the king. So it is a Christo tanquam ab authore conferente: a Rege tanquam a iubente, dirigente, promouente, & protegente.

                  Then you see a thing may be giuen immediatly from God, though in giuing it, he vse the meanes and ministery of man: for in such like speeches the word Immediatly is not so taken as excluding meanes, but as distinguishing the action of God, from the meanes. When the children of Israel were stung of the fierie

                     serpents, God in healing them vsed the meanes of the brasen serpent; yet the vertue of healing proceeded not from the brasen serpent, but immediatly from himselfe; Wisd. 16. 7.

If (Iurisdiction or gouernment) be taken for the freely giuen grace of gouerning or administring Iurisdiction, as Peter and Paul take it; without doubt it is a gift which cannot proceed from man. Wherefore, when S. Paul willeth Timothie, 
                     2. Tim. 1. 6. 
                     To stirre vp the grace which is giuen him, it is to be expounded not onely of the grace of Order, but of all Episcopall grace. And S. Ambrose, when hee saith, God giueth the grace, doeth vndoubtedly meane all Episcopall grace. For who can giue any grace to the Pastours of the Church, but onely the God of all grace, which giueth Pastours to the Church, and appointeth them to be rulers ouer his family? To Salmeron we may adde Henr. Gandauensis, affirming that Bishops haue their power, both of Order and Iurisdiction, immediatly from Christ; As also Gottifredus de Fontibus, and Iohannes de Poliaco, all alleadged by Salmeron; Whose opinions he controuleth without reason, seeing before in effect he affirmed the same. I will conclude this point with the Vniuersitie of Paris, which ratified this position with a Decretum sacrae facultatis Theologiae Parisiensis. Anno 1429. Proposit. 6.

                  If Iurisdiction be giuen in Consecration, then it should be equall in all Bishops.

                  The power it selfe is equall in all, though the determination of the power, which is from the Church, be vnequall. When a Bishop is translated to another See, hee doeth not lose his former habituall power, no more then the Sunne doeth lose his light when hee passeth to the other Hemisphere. When a Bishop of a smaller Circuit is aduanced to a greater, he getteth not a greater power, but a larger subiect whereupon he may exercise his power. And when a Bishop is deposed, hee is not absolutely depriued of his power, but the matter is taken away, vpon which his power should worke. This is confessed by Franc. Varg. de Episc. iurisd. p. 126. 
                     Vargas, to be the opinion of Alphonsus and others; If it happen that a Bishop for any crime bee depriued of his Bishopricke, then he shall bee depriued of his subiects vpon whom hee ought to exercise his power of Iurisdiction, but hee shall not be depriued of the power of Iurisdiction it selfe, receiued in his Consecration.

                     giuing of Iurisdiction must onely proceed from him that is the fountaine of all Spirituall Iurisdiction vnder Christ, which is the Bishop of Rome, or some Metropolitane or Bishop vnder him, that hath authoritie and commission from him. For the Church of God is like vnto a Citie, which hath one onely fountaine, from whence there issue diuers great floods, which are branched out againe into sundry goodly streames, whence the water is conueyed by pipes and conduits to serue the whole Citie. This fountaine is the Bishop of Rome, the great floods are the Patriarches, Archbishops and Metropolitanes: the

streames are the rest of the Bishops: the pipes and conduits are all those which deriue their Iurisdiction from the Bishops. Now the Church of England was sometimes flourishing like the Paradice of God, but since it was cut off from the liuely spring (alas for woe) it is like to a barren and forsaken wildernesse.

And as for the fountaine you speake of, it is not a well of liuing water made by the King of heauen, but a puddle or pit of poyson▪ digged by the Prince of darkenesse. The Bishop of Rome, wee graunt, hath of ancient time beene reuerently regarded, and had, though not a generall iurisdiction, yet a large extent; yea hee had precedencie of dignity and place, before all other Bishops: but this was onely by law humane, because he was the Bishop of the Imperiall Citie; but now hee is like a furious floud which ouerfloweth the bankes, he will be no more confined with bounds and limits, hee chalengeth a generallity of iurisdiction ouer the Christian world, and that by law diuine.

                  The Scripture is full of testimonies declaring both his lawfull authority, and his due execution thereof: his authority might appeare by many arguments, but I will make choice of two, which proue the point in question most directly; the promise of the keyes, & the cōmission of feeding the sheep. To begin with the first: Christ said to Peter, 
                     Mat. 16. 19 
                     I wil giue thee the keyes of the kingdom of heauen; Christ gaue him not one keye only but 2. the key of knowledge & the key of power: by the key of knowledge he was able to open all Scriptures, & controuersies of religion: The key of power is of order, or of iurisdiction: by the key of order, he was able to ordaine Bishops and Pastours of the Church, and againe to lock them out of the ministery by deposing, & degrading as occasion required: by the key of iurisdiction, hee might open and shut both the outward court by excommunications, absolutions, dispensations, calling generall councels &c. and the court of conscience by forgiuing and retaining sinnes. In a word, in these keyes all Ecclesiasticall power was comprehended, and giuen vnto Peter.

                     Bellarmine himselfe iudge the cause betweene vs, who proueth by foure arguments, That the Apostles receiued their iurisdiction immediately from Christ. First by these words of Christ himselfe, As my Father sent me, so send I you, which exposition he strengtheneth by the authorities of Chrysostom, Theophylact, Cyrill and Cyprian, by the euidence whereof he affirmeth▪ that the same thing was giuen to the Apostles by these words, I send you, which was promised to Peter by these words, I will giue thee the keyes, and afterward deliuered by these words, Feed my sheepe: and addeth, Constat autem per illa (tibi dabo claues) & per illud (pasce oues) intelligi iurisdictionē plenissimā etiam exteriorē, i It is cleare that by these words (I will giue thee the keyes) and by this saying (feede my sheep) there is vnderstood a most full iurisdiction euen in the outward Court. Secondly, hee proueth it, because Mathias was neither elected by the Apostles, nor receiued any authority by them, but beeing elected by God was presently accounted amongst the Apostles; And verilie (saith hee) if all the Apostles had their iurisdiction from Peter, that should haue beene manifested most of all in Matthias. Thirdly, he proueth it by Saint Paul, who professeth that he had his iurisdiction from Christ, and thence confirmeth his Apostleship, for he saith, Gal. 1. 1. Paul an Apostle not of men, or by man, but by Iesus Christ: And that he might declare, that he receiued no authoritie from Peter, or any other Apostle, he saith, Gal. 1. 15. 
                     VVhen it pleased God (which had separated me from my mothers womb, & called me by his grace) to reueale his sonne in mee that I should preach him among the Gentiles, immediatly I cōmunicated not with flesh and bloud: Neither came I againe to Ierusalem to thē which were Apostles before mee, but I went into Arabia, and turned againe into Damascus. Then after three yeeres I came againe to Ierusalem to visite Peter. And againe▪ 
                     Gal. 2. 6 
                     To mee those that seemed to bee something, conferred nothing. Fourthly, because the Apostles were made onely by Christ, and yet had Iurisdiction as appeareth, First by Paul excommunicating the Corinthian: Secondly by the same Paul making Ecclesiasticall lawes: Thirdly because the Apostolick dignitie is Prime & suprem dignitas in Ecclesia. Bell. quo supra Quarto. 
                     the highest dignitie in the Church. Wherefore it is euident that the rest of the Apostles receiued not their Iurisdiction from Peter, but from Christ.

                  Whatsoeuer Christ promised, that hee performed; but he performed

not the keyes to Peter with any preheminence aboue his fellows, but alike to all: therefore hee did not promise them to Peter by way of preheminence, but to him with the rest.

Tort. Tort. p. 62. Fathers say according to the Scripture. For when he said, I will giue thee the keyes, he added immediately by way of explication, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth, it shall bee bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, it shall bee loosed in heauen.

                     Bellarmine saith thus, The plaine sence of these wordes, I will giue thee the keyes, and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose, is this, that first there is promised an authoritie or a power signified by the keyes, and then the actions or office is explained by these wordes, to bind and to loose. So that to loose, and to open: to shut, and to bind: is altogether the same. But the Lord expressed the actions of the keyes by loosing and binding, not by shutting and opening, that we might vnderstand that all these speeches are metaphoricall, and that heauen is then opened vnto men when they are loosed from their sinnes, which hindered their entrance into heauen. But the power of binding and loosing was giuen to all the Apostles, by Christ in these wordes, Mat. 18. 18. 
                     whatsoeuer you shall bind on earth, shall bee bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer you shall loose on earth shall bee loosed in heauen.

                     S. Ierome witnesseth, 68. yeeres after the Passion of Christ, and consequently died in the yeere 101. which according to Anno 101. num. 2. 
                     Baronius, was the 9. yeere of Clemens. If this be so, then there was after the death of Christ while an Apostle liued, a greater iurisdiction in the Church, then the iurisdiction of an Apostle, which cannot be, because the Scripture saith, that 1. Cor. 12. 28. 
                     God hath set in his Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, &c. and Bell. confesseth that the authoritie of the Apostles is De Rom. pont. l. 4. c. 23. Addit. 
                     Iurisdictio plenissima. If S. Iohn had this, then he was not Legat a latere to Linus, nor Cletus, nor Clemens, neither so long as he liued could they be called the fountaine of all spirituall iurisdiction. If you say, they were Christs delegates, it is true, and so was Saint Peter, therefore in this there is no difference. But in what respect was he the ordinarie pastor of the Church? As an Apostle? then they should bee all ordinarie, because they were all Apostles. If in regard of any other authoritie, what should that bee? Was it greater thē the Apostleship or no? if it were not, how could it giue him iurisdiction ouer the Apostles? and greater it cannot bee, for the Apostleship is the greatest iurisdiction which Christ left vnto his Church, as was proued both by the Scripture and your owne confession. But when was he made an ordinarie pastor?

                  No. For Christ gaue commission to Peter to feed his sheep, euen all his sheepe, none excepted: but the Apostles were his sheepe, so the Apostles themselues were committed to S. Peter. Therefore hee was the pastour of the Apostles, and consequently the ordinarie pastour of the whole world.

                     preach the Gospel to euery creature, euen to euery creature none excepted. But S. Peter was a creature, therefore S. Peter himselfe was committed to S. Andrew. What thinke you, was S. Andrew S. Peters pastour, or the ordinarie pastour of the whole world?

                  These words feed my sheepe, haue beene so much vexed that now for pitty you should let them alone: but to answere you, though our Sauiour, when he said, Feed my sheep directed his speech to Peter, yet he did not therein giue any new office, or speciall commission to Peter, but willed him to looke to his charge alreadie receiued. For Peter had bewrayed great want of loue in a threefold denyall of his master, therefore Christ to kindle

his loue did aske him three times, Peter doest thou loue me? Whereupon as hee had formerly denyed him thrice, so now he protested his loue, and confessed him thrice; then Christ hauing as it were blowne the fire by a threefold question, which began to kindle in Peter by a threefold confession, did presently strike while the yron was hot, vsing this exhortatiō, Feed my lambs, & to make the more impression, he redoubled the stroake, saying, Feed my sheepe, Feede my sheepe; As though he should say, if thou loue me, deny me no more in word nor deed; but shew thy loue by keeping thy station, and by feeding the flock which I haue purchased with my precious blood. Feed them by doctrine, Feed them by example: thou shalt meet and encounter with many Beares, and lyons, yet forsake not thy function for feare, but if thou loue me, feed my flock. As if a Pilot should say to his mariners, here is like to be a great storme, but if you loue me, looke well to your tacklings: or a Captaine to his souldiers, here may be a hard battaile, yet if you loue me be of a good courage: or a husband being to goe a farre iourney, and leauing at home his yong sonne, the hope of his house,, with his wife, which had sometimes shewed herselfe somewhat vnkind, should say, wife if thou loue me, looke well to my child; which is not to giue her any new commission or office, but to put her in mind to discharge that office which God had formerly committed vnto her. And what if Christ said to Peter, Feed my sheepe? shall he therefore bee the master shepheard, and the rest of the Apostles his vnderlings? shall hee bee a Bishop, and they his Chaplaines? Saint 2.

                     Dic Ecclesiae. i. make thy complaints, and tell thy grieuances to the Church: so other Apostles did exercise the Iurisdiction, belonging to this tribunall, as well as Peter; whether we consider them assembled in Synodes, or seuerally by themselues.

                  His proposing the matter, argueth a primacie of place, not of Iurisdiction or power. For though he alone proposeth the matter, yet he alone had not the appointment▪ the text saith plainely, they 
                     Vers. 23. 
                     appointed two, and of the two God himselfe made choice, and elected Matthias, as appeareth by these words, they 
                     Vers. 24. 
                     prayed saying, thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen: and when the lot fell vpon Matthias, S. Peter gaue him no Iurisdiction, neither did they expect, till S. Peter sent him a Pall, but he was presently Vers. 2. 6 
                     counted among the Apostles; therefore his authoritie was not from man, or by man, but from Iesus Christ. Moreouer, that the Scripture ascribeth no more to him in elections then to the rest, may appeare by the second Synod (as Binius calleth it) wherein the Deacons were chosen. For who called the multitude together? the text saith, the 
                     Act. 62. 
                     twelue, not S. Peter alone, but the twelue: and who chose them? Not S. Peter, but the multitude, as the Scripture witnesseth: Vers. 5. 
                     The saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and the holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas a proselyte of Antiochia: which they set before the Apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them. So it is euident, that though the Apostles ordained them, yet the whole multitude chose them.

                  Then it seemeth there is great difference betweene the Apostles and the Pope, for the Apostles did not challenge their owne right, they did gratifie the people and grant it vnto them: but the Pope will rake all vnto himselfe though hee rob Prince, Priest, and people. Now whereas you say they did that by the grant of the Apostles, it is true, if by grant you meane the consent and counsel of the Apostles; Actes 6. 3▪
                      
                     For they exhorted the multitude to looke out seuen men of honest report: but if you meane that the whole right belonged so absolutely to the Apostles, that they might totally haue excluded the people; you must consider, that in this case the consent of the people depended vpon the grounds of humane society. For there was then speciall reason, why the whole Church should haue interest, in the choice of Deacons, because the treasure of the whole Church was cōmitted to their trust. But admit it were absolutely by the grant of the Apostles: yet marke what you say, by the grant of the Apostles; not of Peter alone, but of the Apostles. Thus it doth not appeare that

                     Peter had any prerogatiue more then other Apostles, no not so much as in the choice of a Deacon.

                  That he had Iurisdiction more then they, is manifest by the third Synod holden at Ierusalem in the yeere of Christ 51. where indeed S. Peter shewed himselfe: for Vide Stapl. princ. doctr. l. 6. cap. 13

                  Not one of all these points is true. That, S. Peter spake not first, is cleare by these words, Acts. 157. 
                     When there had bene much disputation, Peter rose vp and said, &c. That he spake not last, appeareth also: for the Text mentioneth no speach of his, but one; After him spake Verse 12. 
                     Paul and Barnabas: after them Verse 13. 
                     S. Iames: and the Councell concluded the matter according to the words of Verse 20. 
                     S. Iames: yea according to a speciall point not mentioned by S. Peter. Neither were the Actes of the Counsell set out in the name of S. Peter, but a Synodall Epistle was sent in the names of them all; Neither did S. Peter subscribe vnto it, I Peter the Vic

                     It seemeth good to the holy Ghost, and vs. Where is now his super-eminent authoritie? If euer hee should haue shewed it, this was the time, this was the place, especially seeing he was present, not by his Legate, but in his owne person. If now he had chalenged it, his successours might for euer quietly haue enioyed it. What did he meane thus to forget himselfe, and to preiudice posteritie? And as the Apostolicall Synods receiued not their authoritie from him, so neither did the Apostles themselues, seuerally considered. As is euident in S.

                  This you say oft, but proue neuer. For the clearing whereof we must consider, that in the Apostles, some things were extraordinary, some things ordinary. They had 4. extraordinary prerogatiues, immediate vocation by Christ himselfe, vnlimited Commission ouer all Nations, infallible direction both in preaching and writing, and power to worke Miracles; All which were necessary for the first planting of Churches, but were not conueyed to posteritie by succession. Other things they had which were necessary for the Church in all future ages, in which they had successours. They had power to minister the word and Sacraments, wherein euery Presbyter succeedeth them. They ordained Ministers, executed censures, and other things belonging to the gouernment of the Church; wherein euery Bishop succeedeth them. So in the latter, the rest haue successours as well as Peter: In the former as the rest had no successours, so neither had Peter.

                     IF wee consider the practise of the Christian world in primitiue antiquitie, which was nearest to the fountaine, and knew best the meaning of Law Diuine, wee shall finde that they were either elected, or at least confirmed by the Pope, or by authoritie from the Pope, either expresly, or by his permission or conniuencie, and so receiued their iurisdiction.

                  To examine these points in order, let vs begin with the election of Ministers, concerning which, we find three varieties in the new Testament. The first by lots: the second by voyces: the third by the spirit of prophesie. Act. 1. 26. 
                     Matthias was chosen by lots; the Act. 6. 5. Deacons by voyces; 1. Tim. 1. 18. & 4. 14. 
                     Timothy and others by the spirit of prophesie. For as Chr
                           •

                     Chrysostome saith; In those dayes the pastours were made by prophesie: what is, by prophecie? by the holy Ghost; as Saul was shewed by prophecie, when hee lay hid among the stuffe: as the holy Ghost said, separate vnto me Paul and Barnabas, so was Timothie chosen. 
                     Theod. in. 1. ad Tim. c. 1. Theodoret; thou hast not thy calling from men, but thou receiuedst that order by diuine reuelation. 
                     Oec. in 1. ad Tim. cap. 1. Oecumenius; by reuelation of the spirit, Timothy was chosen of Paul to bee a Disciple, and ordained a Bishop. This kind of election seemeth to bee vsuall in the Apostles times, and to haue continued so long as the gift of prophecie and discerning of spirits remained. Now of these three, the first and third were by God himselfe; the second by all the faithfull. This is all wee finde in Scripture; yet here is no precept, but onely example. Wherefore it seemeth that the Lord hath left this point as a thing indifferent to bee ordered by the discretion of the Church, so all things be done honestly and in order. From the Scripture, if wee come to the ages following, they referred it to the Clergie and people.

                  The Councell in that place nameth Priestes, not Bishops; and if vnder the name of Priestes you comprehend Bishops, yet you must consider that it being onely prouinciall, could not impose lawes to the whole Christian world. That Bishops were chosen by popular elections after this Councell, may appeare by the great Nicen Councell (assembled as Baronius thinketh six yeeres after the Councell of Laodicea) in their Synodall Epistle to the Church of Alexandria, and to the beloued brethren of Egypt, Lybia and Pentapolis.

                  But Saint Cyprian calleth it a iust and lawfull ordination which hath beene examined, Cypr. epist. 68. sect. 4. 
                     Omnium suffragio, by the suffrage or voyce of all, that is both of Clergie and people; which he exemplifieth in the ordination of Cornelius Bishop of Rome, in these wordes, Epist. 52. sect. 4. 
                     Cornelius was made Bishop by the iudgement of God, and his Christ, by the testimonie of almost all the Clergy, by the suffrage of the people which was then present, and by the Colledge of ancient Priestes and good men. Yea the suffrages of the people are a thing so clearly set downe in antiquitie, that Pamelius himselfe cannot deny them, Pam▪ in epist. Cypr. 68. 
                     wee deny not (saith hee) the olde rite of electing Bishops, by which they are wont to bee chosen, the people being present, yea rather by the voyces of the people: for that it was obserued in Africk, is euident by the election of Eradius the successour of S. Austin, Concerning which there is extant his 110. Epistle: In Grecce in the age of Chrysostome, as appeareth by his third booke of Priesthood: In Spaine by this place of Cyprian, and Isidor in his booke of offices: In France by the epistle of Celestinus: At Rome, by those things which were spoken before vpon the epistle to Antonianus: yea euery where else by the 87. epistle of Leo; and that this custome continued vntill Gregory the first (appeareth) by his epistle, yea euen vnto the times of the Emperours Charles and Lodowick, as it is manifest enough out of the first booke of their chapters; and the same Pamelius in another place saith, the manner of chusing the Bishop of Rome was often changed; first Saint Peter chose his successours Linus, Cletus, and Clemens: then Anacletus and the rest vnto the second Schisme betweene Damasus and Vrsicinus were created by the suffrages of the Clergie & the people: behold how Pamelius who a litle before interpreted the peoples elections in Cyprian, as though they elected onely by way of testimonie (a colde and a hungry interpretation,) is now forced to confesse (ô the euidence of trueth) that they elected by way of suffrage: yea, and that the Roman Bishops from Anacletus to Damasus, (that is, from the yeere 103. to the yeere 307.) were so elected. Wherefore it is most true which is affirmed by our learned Epist. Elien. resp. ad apo. Bel. c. 13. pag 313. Bishop. Presentia plebis apud Cyprianum includit testimonium de vita, nec excludit suffragium de persona. i.

                     Cyprian maketh no mention of the Pope, but declareth that almost in all Prouinces after the death of a Bishop, the Bishops next adioyning did meet about an election, in the citie of the Bishop deceased, and so the election was performed in their presence, by the Suffrages of the whole fraternitie; that is, both of the Clergie and like wise also of the people. Wherefore that which you say concerning the Pope, is but a voluntary speech, without any ground. And surely seeing God hath set downe no certaine rule nor precept in holy Scripture, but left it as a thing indifferent, it was most fit that in those primatiue times, the people should haue a Suffrage, for by this meanes it came to

passe, that they did not only more quietly receiue, diligently heare, and heartily loue, but also more willingly and bountifully maintaine their Bishop, wherefore their Suffrage was grounded vpon right and reason.

And whereas in those dayes Bishops vsed to be chosen by the consent of the people and Clergie, openly created in the Church, and ordained, if it were possible, by all the Bishops of the Prouince, at least by three, with the consent of the Metropolitane; Constantius in stead of the Church, would haue it done in his Palace; In place of the people, there were present three of his Eunuches, and for the Bishops of the Prouince, three, which Athanasius calleth not

For that this was anciently acknowledged to be the right of Christian Princes, will appeare, if we consider the election of Bishops in the Imperiall Cities of Rome, and Constantinople, as also in the Kingdomes of France and Spaine.

                     authoritie of Emperours began to bee interposed in the election of Damasus, and first of all verely onely in Schisme to pacifie vproares, and so the matter was composed by Valentintan betweene Damasus and Vrsicinus; By Honorius, betweene Boniface and Eulalius; And by King Theodoricke, betweene Symmachus and Laurentius. Afterward Emperours intermedled euen when there was no Schisme, to preuent, least peraduenture there should be vprores. Yea, and the matter came by little and little to that passe, that Bishops elected, durst not receiue Consecration without their assent.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The first Christian Emperour was Constantine the Great, conuerted according to the calculation of Baronius, in the yeere of Christ 312. the second yeere of Pope Melchtades, and the 7. yeere of his sitting in the Imperiall Throne. In his time succeeded three Bishops of Rome, Siluester, Marcus and Iulius; whose elections, Constantine dwelling farre of, permitted to be performed as in ancient maner, by the Suffrages of the Clergie and people. Yet what authoritie he thought himselfe to haue in such matters, may appeare by these his words to Athanasius, 
                     Socrat. l. 1. cap. 20. 
                     If I shall vnderstand that any man which is desirous to be partaker of the Church, shalbe hindered or excluded by thee, I will presently send one, who by my commandement shall cast thee out, and giue thy place to another. After Iulius succeeded Liberius, Anno 352, Constantius being sole Emperour, who though he intermeddled not with this Election in the West, yet he interposed himselfe before that time in the East. For when the people had slaine Hermogenes the Captaine in defence of Proclus, he came himselfe in person to Constantinople, and cast Proclus out of the Church, yet he deferred (saith Socrat l. 2. cap. 
                           •
                        0. 
                     Socrates) to pronounce Macedonius Bishop, because he was wonderfully incensed against him, as for other reasons, so because he was chosen without his aduice and counsell; notwithstanding, hee gaue him licence to execute his function in that Church onely, wherein hee was chosen; but afterward vnderstanding that Paulus was placed againe, he sent one Philip to cast out Paulus, and to place Macedonius. Thus you see how both Constantine and Constantius, interposed their authoritie before the time of Damasus. And had not Valentinian done the like, Ammian. Marcel. l. 27. 
                     Damasus could hardly haue obtained the Popedome, because the contrary faction was so strong.

                     Gratian, Valentinian the yonger, and Theodosius, succeeded Siricius, in the yeere of Christ 385. being the tenth yeere of Valentinian, and the seuenth of Theodosius, whose election was memoratus Episcopus ipse permaneat. Bar. Anno 385 n. 6. 
                     confirmed by the Emperour Valentinian, as may appeare by his Epistle to Pinianus, extant in the Vatican, and published by Baronius.

                  This was extraordinary by reason of Schisme: but it was no ordinary matter till the dayes of Iustinian. For then, as Onuph. in Plat. in Pelag. 2. 
                     Onuphrius saith, After the Gothes were driuen out of Italy, (which happened in the yeere 553.) there
                     
                     grew a custome by the authoritie of Pope Vigilius, to wit, That so soone as the Pope was dead▪ a new election should presently be made after the ancient maner, by the Clergie, the Senate, and people of Rome, but the elected might not bee Consecrated, before the Emperour of Constantinople confirmed the election, and gaue licence to the Pope elected, that he might be ordained and Consecrated. Now if this grew by the authoritie of the Pope, it doeth not argue any right originally in the Emperour, but onely deriued from the Pope.
               
               
                  ORTHO.
                  A constitution was made at that time, That the new elected Pope should not onely craue licence of the Emperour to be ordained, but also pay him a certaine summe of money; which was done to this end, as Ibid. 
                     Onuphrius witnesseth, That the Emperour might be assured of the behauiour and conditions of the new Popes, least any turbulent spirit or enemy to the Emperour beeing ordained, the City of Rome and the country of Italy might reuolt from the Easterne Empire: for now the authority of the Pope began to bee great, by reason that the Emperour liued farre off at Constantinople. But though this paying of money begun in the time of Vigilius, yet the authority of the Emperor in elections was before his time, as witnesseth Platina in the life of Siluerius the Predecessor of Vigilius. Siluerius (saith he) borne in Campania hauing for his father Hormisda a Bishop, was created Pope by the commandement of Theodohatus; cum antea non regum sed imperatorum authoritas interueniret, whereas before that time the authority not of Kings but of Emperours was interposed. So hee speaketh of it as a knowne ordinary and vsuall matter. Yea and Iustinian tooke it so hainously to be robbed of this right, that as

                     Platina declareth, this was one of the causes why hee sent Belisarius with an army into Italy. Moreouer as it was the custome of the Emperor before Vigilius, so it remained long after.

                  It is a tale deuised by Sigebert in fauour of Henry the fourth a schismaticall Emperour which challenged inuestitures; and though many writers haue recorded it, yet they were all deceiued by Sigebert, hee was the first authour, and from him they haue sucked it as Cardinall Anno 774. num. 10.

And here let vs admire the wisedome of God who discloseth the workes of darkenesse, and reuealeth what is done euen in your priuy chambers. For Baronius remembring none who recorded this before Sigebert, but Anastasius, might flatter himselfe, that if he could father it vpon Sigebert hee should doe well enough; for those worthy writers and noble historians which haue from time to time deliuered this story by the space of 340. yeeres, hee cutteth them all off at one blow, as being all deceiued by Sigebert. Sigebert himselfe hee discrediteth, as writing partially in fauour of Henry the fourth, a schismaticall Emperour. And as for Anastasius, the popish physitions gaue him a purgation to cleanse him from such noisome humors. But marke the mischiefe of it, they did not remember that Platina in Pope Pascall had blazed to the world, that Anastasius wrote it; for if they had, you may be sure they would haue put a gag in his mouth. But now Platina hath plaied the blab, Sigebert is found an honest man, and popish packing and iugling is come to light.

                  The Romanes had receiued great kindnesse, not onely from Charles, but also from his father, and grandfather. For first of all when the Lombards besieged the citie of Rome, his grandfather, Charles Martell, was the meanes of raising the siege: Afterward when the Lombards hauing wonne Rauenna, did seeke to haue Rome also, and the Romane Dukedome, his father Pipin recouering Rauenna, did bestow it with the territories thereof, vpon Saint Peter and his successours: which Charles, after his conquest of Italy, did establish and amplifie. He neuer entred the citie with violence, but expelled those which offered them violence. He neuer aduanced his banner against them, but when they were vexed by the Lombards, and not being able to defend themselues, implored his ayde, he droue the Lombards out of Italy, and protected them. Finally, he neuer was an enemie to Rome, but alwayes a friend; for which great benefits, the Romanes to shew themselues thankeful, did yeeld vnto him Princely prerogatiues, both in Church and Common wealth.

                  ORTHOD.
                  The power of electing the Pope, may be ascribed vnto Charles in a double sence; either that he might doe it with the Clergie, and people, or without thē: if in the first sense, then the meaning of the Canon, is not to debarre the Clergie and people from elections, but to decree that though they may lawfully make an election, yet their election is not sufficient, and auailable, vnlesse the Emperour doe perfect and accomplish it with his royall assent. If this be the meaning, then whatsoeuer is heere deliuered to Charles, was before his time anciently acknowledged to belong to the Emperours, as I haue alreadie declared. And yet for your further satisfaction, you may see in the Dist. 63. Agatho. Canon law, that though the Emperor Constantinus Pogonatus, by his Diualis or sacred Epistle, released to Pope Agatho the some of money, which the Bishops of Rome euer since the time of the Emperour Iustinian, vsed to pay for their ordination; yet he added this clause, vt non debeat ordinari qui electus fuerit, nisi prius decretum generale introducatur in regiam vrbem secundum antiquam Consuetudinē, vt cum eorum conscientia & iussione debeat ordinatio prosperari. i. that the party elected ought not to be ordained, vnlesse, first, the generall decree of his election, (strenthned with the subscriptions of the electors) were brought into the imperial city, according to the ancient custome, that so the ordination might prosperously proceed with the knowledge and commandement of the Emperours. Wherefore if we imbrace this sence of the Canon, we may iustly say, Episcopus Eliensis in Resad apol. Bell. c. 6 p. 140. 
                     Decretum hoc iuris veteris, vel restitutio, vel continuatio; non concessio noui. 1. this decree (to speak properly) is either a restoring, or a continuing of an ancient right, not a grant of a new; and consequently this was no priuiledge, proceeding frō the grace and bounty of the Pope, but a voluntary and ingenuous confession of the Princes right. But some do follow the other sense, extending the decree, euen to a sole and plenare power of electing at his owne pleasure, without the Clergie and people. For Duaren. de sa

                     Duarenus saith thus. In ancient time the Bishop of Rome vsed not to be ordained without the consent and authoritie of the Roman Emperour: and all kings vsed in a maner the same power in the Churches of their owne kingdomes: yet the right of Electing was not therfore taken away from the Clergie, but afterward the right of the electing the Romane Bishops was of their owne accord, altogether granted and permitted to the Emperours, Charles and Otho. And a little after, a full power of electing at his owne pleasure was granted to Charles, which seemeth more probable, because

Howsoeuer, this is certaine that the Pope and Councell did ascribe vnto him, if not a sole and plenary, yet at least a principall and preuailing power in electing the high Bishop. If we imbrace the first; then so farre as they confered vpon him their owne former right, it may be called a gift or grant: If the latter, it was no gift nor grant, but an acknowledgement of the ancient right and prerogatiue of the Empire.

                  This may seeme to argue that Adrian and the Councel did yeeld vnto him a plenary power, yet notwithstanding hee like a gracious

Prince permitted, that elections should be free as in former times. But what if they were free? must the Prince therefore bee excluded? Before the diuision of the Empire, the Romanes might freely elect whom they list, and yet the elected could not be Consecrated till he were approued of the Emperour: so Charles might grant freedome of elections, and yet reserue to himselfe his royall assent.

And Mat. Paris in Hen. 1. p. 62. 
                     Matthew Paris saith, That the Emperour was desirous to vse the priuiledge of his predecessours, which they hadenioyed 300. yeeres vnder 60. Popes. Thus much in generall.

                  Yes by your leaue, he saith somewhat; But if hee were silent, what then? Are not other Authors sufficient to witnesse it? The next Pope after Adrian, and the onely Pope elected in the time of Charles was Leo the third, who (as Gill

Was not this a resignation both of the Citie and Church into the Emperours hands? Was not this an ingenuous acknowledgement that he would not hold the possession of S.

For afterwards when a strong faction had deposed Leo, hee fled into France to Charles, Who sent him back to Rome, and

Whereupon he decreeth, that the Consecration should be praesentibus Legatis Imperialibus, i. The Emperours Ambassadors being present. And withall forbiddeth all men to extort any new Oathes, whereby the Church may bee scandalized, and the Imperiall honour diminished. Wherefore it is probable, that

his hasty going was to excuse the matter, because, as it seemeth, he was Consecrated without the Emperours knowledge. Which is yet more likely, because the next Pope Plat. in Pasc. 1. 
                     Paschall, being created without Imperiall authoritie, sent presently to the Emperour Lodowick, to excuse the matter, by laying the blame vpon the Clergie and people; Whereto he answered, That the Clergie and people must keepe the decrees of their ancestours, and admonished them hereafter to take heed not to offend the Imperiall Maiestie.

                  Indeed Plat. in pasc. 1. 
                     Platina saith, That the keeper of the Library, (meaning Anastasius) writeth, that Lodowick gaue free power of Electing Bishops to Pope Pascall, whereas before this time the Emperours were consulted withall about the matter. If the Emperour gaue it, then the Emperour had it; And if Anastasius say so, then he saith something of the Emperours.
                  MOreouer, if Lodowick did resigne it, surely his sonne Lotharius did resume5 it. In whose time three Popes were created, Sergius the 2. Leo the 4 and Benedict the 3, all by Imperiall authoritie. To begin with the first; Sigebert. anno 844. 
                     Sigebert sheweth, how Lotharius sent his sonne Lodowick to Rome, to confirme the Election of Sergius.

                     Bar. anno 844. n. 5.

                  How doeth this confute it? These things are not contrary, but may stand well together. The Emperour sent Lodowick to confirme the Pope; the Pope being confirmed, did Crowne Lodowick. So notably doeth Baronius confute Sigebert. The next was Leo, at whose Election as the Romanes were not a little glad, so Anast. in Leone 4. 
                     Anastasius himselfe saith, they began againe not to be a little sad, because they durst not consecrate him that should be Pope, without the Imperiall authoritie.

                  Iustly and Canonically? I hope you will say, that S. Gregorie was Elected and Consecrated iustly and Canonically: yet hee was confirmed by the Emperour. Wherefore this Couenant did not disanull the Imperiall authoritie. Which is most cleare in the next Pope, Benedict the 3,

after whose Election made by the ioynt consent of the Clergie and people; Clerus & cuncti proceres (saith Anast. in Benedict 3.

                     Platina saith, that Henry had no power from God to create a Pope, so he put of his purple, and entred Rome, as a priuate man; Whereupon the Romane Clergie elected him the rather, because by this his fact hee had translated all the authoritie of chusing the Pope from the Emperour to the Clergie.

                     Theodosius the elder commaunded the Bishops to giue him in writing, the names of such as they thought fit for the place; reseruing to himselfe the power of Electing one out of all. It fell out that there was at that time at Constantinople, an ancient and reuerend old man, Nectarius by name, who being about to returne to Tarsus, came to Diodorus the Bishop thereof, to know whether he would haue any thing thither: Diodorus on a sudden liking the behauiour of the man, though a stranger vnto him, shewed him to the Bishop of Antioch, praying him to remember him in the catalogue of names. The Bishop of Antioch smiled at the conceit of Diodorus, because many men of eminent note, were nominated for this Election; yet for fashion sake to please Diodorus, he put Nectarius in among the rest, and placed him last. The Emperour hauing read ouer the catalogue, made a pause at the name of Nectarius, and making a marke with his finger, he read them ouer againe, and chose Nectarius. And when euery man inquired who this Nectarius was, it appeared that he was not as yet baptized; a thing which was vnknowne to the Emperour, vnknowne to the Bishop of Antioch & vnknowne to Diodorus; Yet the Emperour hauing made his choice, would not be remoued, and the Councell then assembled, pronounced him Bishop of Constantinople, euen while he was yet in his Christening vesture. After the death of Nectarius, the Clergie and people chose Chrysostome; the Emperour 
                     Sozom. l. 8. cap. 2. 
                     approued the Election, and sent to fetch him from Antioch. After the death of Sisinnius, though many made sute for Philip, and many for Proclus, yet it was the

                     (Nestorius) from Antioch. After the death of Maximianus, Theodosius the Emperour, lest any tumult should be raised in the Church, procured the Bishops then present, to install Proclus in the Bishops seat, euen while the corps of Maximianus was as yet aboue ground; which Socrat. l. 7 cap 39. 
                     Socrates commendeth in the Emperour as a point of wisdome.

                  When Nestorius Bishop of Constantinople was deposed, and Proclus in faire possibilitie to obtaine the place, some stood vp Socrat l. 7.

                     alledging against him, that it was not lawfull to be translated from one See to another; whereupon Proclus was repelled, and Maximianus chosen. Wherefore after the death of Maximianus, when Celestine heard that Proclus was installed, he wrote to Cyrill and others, signifying that translations of Bishops was lawful, and not against the Canons. So Celestine onely giueth his iudgement, but assumeth no authoritie in the Election, which was already performed by Imperiall authoritie. Thus you see the practise of the Emperours in the Church of Constantinople, no man contradicting them; and the very last of these examples was aboue 300. yeeres before the grant of Adrian, yea aboue 100. yeeres before Vigilius. Now from the Imperiall Cities, let vs come to the kingdome of Spaine.

These things are euident by the Monuments of ancient writers; Now because much time passed before they could be dispatched, by reason whereof the Sees were long vacant, therefore the Councell made the decree. Thus it is euident that the authoritie of the Councell, was translated to the Archbishop; but the Kings authoritie was the same as before, and had so bene from the time of the Gothes.

                     IN France the Kings had the choise of Bishops almost 300. yeeres before the Empire came to their hands. For their first Christian King Clodoueus (conuerted in the yeere 499) Greg. Turon. l. 10. c. 31. elected Dinifius Bishop of Turone. After him succeeded Childibertus, who made his brethren Clodomer, Theodorick, and Clotharius partakers of his Kingdome, all which vsed the same authority; for by the commandement Ibidem. l. 3. cap. 17▪
                      of Clodomer, Omasius was made Bishop of Turone after Dinifius; by the Greg: Turon. l. 3. c. 2. commandement of Theodorick, Quintianus was made Bishop of Aruerne; by the commandement Idem. l. 4. c. 15. of Clotharius, Cato was appointed to be Bishop of Turone, which when he refused, and afterward would haue had it, the King repelled him. After the death of Clotharius raigned his sonne Cheribert, who Idem. l. 4. c. 18▪
                      made Pascentius Bishop of Poictiers. But why should I reckon vp any moe? There is a world of examples recorded by Gregorius Turonensis, & collected from him by one of our learned

Afterward when the French Kings became Roman Emperours, Pope Adrian decreed, and defined that they should haue not only Inuestitures but also the disposing of the Roman See, as hath beene declared. And although Lodowick the sonne of Charles bee said to haue renounced the right of choosing the Bishop of Rome; yet as the Paris curiae de

Notwithstanding it came to passe in processe of time, that the Pope by his prouisions, reseruations, and expectatiue graces made lamentable desolation in the

This pragmatical sanction was fitly called by a great Apud Duarenū quo supra. learned man, the Palladium of France; for as the image of Pallas was said to fall downe from heauen among the Troianes; so this sanction seemed to be sent from heauen by diuine prouidence among the Frenchmen: And as Apollo did prophesie that the remouing of the Palladium would be the destruction of Troy; so wise men presaged that the taking away of this Sanction would portend great calamity to the Church of France. Yet for al this the Popes would neuer be quiet till they had, if not wholly vanquished, yet wonderfully weakened it, especially Pius the 2. who was one of the Bishops in the councel of Basil, but now beeing Pope, hee is become another man; neither wanted there some which to please the Pope, opposed themselues against it; whose subtilties and Sophismes are answered by that famous Canonist Archbishop Panormitan, who was himselfe also one of the Bishops in the councel of Basil. Yea the court of Paris: curiae defens: pro libertate eccl. Gal. sect. 18. Paris offered a booke to Lodowick the eleuenth, wherein they declared, how by the abrogation of the Sanction foure mischiefs would follow: the first, A confusion of the whole Ecclesiasticall order: the 2. a desolation of their country: the 3. the impouerishing of the kingdome, by wasting their treasure: the 4. the ruine and subuersion of Churches. The consideration of which things so preuailed with the King, that Pope Pius was disapointed of his purpose.

                     That which Pius could not performe in the daies of Lewis (videlicet, that the pragmaticall Sanction should be taken cleane away) was afterward effected by Leo the 10. in the reigne of King Francis the first; therefore in the councell of Lateran the pragmaticall Sanction was abrogated by a publique Decree.

                     King Francis (to vse the words of Duarenus) made choice rather to serue the stage and the time with his owne profit, as hee himselfe confesseth, and remit somewhat of the publique right, then to striue so oft with the Popes about this Helena, especially seeing he perceiued that some danger from them did hang ouer his head. Yet for al this the Sanction cannot be said to bee cleane taken away; For the vniuersity of 
                     Decret. eccl. Gal. p. 1249. vide Episcopum Eliens. in resp. ad Apol. Bell. p. 148. 
                     Paris did interpose an appeale to the next general councell, which appeale stood with iustice & equity for 3. reasons; first because the fact of the king was not voluntary but by compulsion: Secondly, because the Parisians whom it must concerned were neither called nor heard. Thirdly, because there is no reason that the councell of Lateran and constitution of Leo, should derogate from the authority of the councel of Basil. And if we should suppose, that it did not onelie derogate from it but also abrogate it, yet the verie constitution of Pope Leo yeeldeth to the King the power of nomination, in these wordes: Duarenus quo supra. c. 12 
                     VVhen a Cathedrall or Metropoliticall Church is vacant, let not the Bishoppe bee chosen by the Colledge of Canons, but let the King within sixe monethes offer and nominate a graue and fit man to the Pope. Thus it is euident that the French Kings retained their right and authoritie in making of Bishoppes euer since their first embracing of the Christian faith.

And had they this by the indulgence of the Pope? Let the Councell of Basill be witnesse, let Charles the seuenth bee witnesse, let the Court of Paris bee witnesse, yea let King Francis himselfe (who confessed that when hee went against the sanction, hee remitted of the publique right) be witnesse. And thus much for France.

That William the Conquerour vsed the like authoritie is also manifest by the same authour, saying, Ibidem l. 1

The like may be shewed before the Conquest; where, by the way let me tell you, that wee stand not so much vpon the ring and the staffe, as vpon the thing it selfe, that is the Princes power and authoritie, for which I will produce some examples as it were a few clusters of a great vintage, beginning with Edward the Confessour, of whom Malmsbury faith, Lib. 1. p. 204 
                     Rex Robertum, quem ex Monacho Gemiticensi Londoniae fecerat Episcopum, Archiepiscopum creauit, the King (Edward the Confessour) created Robert Archbishop, whom before of a Monke he had made Bishop of London.

                     Wilfrid to an Episcopall See. Thus it is euident that as in other Kingdomes, so in England Inuestitures were anciently practised by Princes. Wherefore King Henrie the first might haue challenged them, not onely as vsed by his father and brother, but also as the ancient custome of the Kingdome in the time of the Saxons. Wherein onely this was the difference, that in ancient time Princes vsed them without

contradiction, but now the Popes perceiuing that if Princes should haue the bestowing of them after the olde custome, it would abate that power to which they themselues aspired, beganne to spurne, excommunicating both the giuers and takers. This was done in the fifth and seuenth Romane Councels vnder Gregory the seuenth: but Pope Mat. Paris pag. 18. 
                     Vrban went further, decreeing that not onely the giuers and takers, but also all such as consecrated any man so promoted should bee excommunicate. At this Councell Anselmus was present, by whose Anselm. consilio. ibidem. 
                     aduise and perswasion the decree was made. Whereupon when after the death of William Rufus, King Henry the first, (not knowing of this decree, much lesse imagining that it was concluded by the meanes of Anselmus) had called him home, hee well rewarded the kindnesse of so gracious a Prince; for first hee would not bee induced to doe his Malms. degest. pont.

Rinelmus Elect of Hereford resigned his Bishopricke into the kings hands being troubled in conscience because hee receiued inuestiture from a lay Prince; by occasion of which broiles, the rest to whom the king had giuen inuestitures remained vnconsecrated.

Roman Councels, practised commonly and anciently by all kings through the whole Christian world, yeelded to his predecessours in the time of the Saxons, vsed by his own father and brother, and neuer denied in England before Anselmus began to broach the Hildebrandicall Doctrine.

Thus the cause was determined against the King.

But notwithstanding the Popes determination, the king disdaining to bee so deluded, sent to Anselmus

                     That his progenitors and other noble and faithfull men had founded and indowed Churches, and placed Ministers in them, euer since the first planting of religion in the Realme of England, and that the kings did of ancient time, freely conferre Cathedrall Churches, iure suo Regio, by their Princely right, so oft as they were vacant; he doth not say, by the Popes permission, but by their princely right, so the collation of Bishopricks, is the ancient right of the kings of England. Moreouer he told him that whereas now Deanes and Chapters elect, this proceeded from the graunt of the kings, at the request and instance of the Pope; he doth not say, from the graunt of the Pope, but from the grant of the kings, at the request of the Pope; with which concordeth that famous act of Parliament, made in the 25. of Edw. the third; Our Soueraigne Lord the king and his heires, shall haue and inioy for the time the collations to the Archbishoprickes, and other dignities electiue, which be of his aduowry, such as his progenitors had, before free election was granted: Sith that the first elections were granted by the Kings progenitors, vpon a certaine forme and condition, as namely to demaund license of the King to chuse, and after choice made, to haue his royall assent.

The next yeere, the same king set out a 
                     Idem pag. 344. 
                     Proclamation, that all such as were resident in the Court of Rome, and had benefices in England, should returne by the feast of S. Nicholas, vnder paine of forfeiting all their benefices. When the Pope heard all this thundering, he sent a Nuncio with great complaints; for answere wherof the

king referred him to the Parliament following, which would by no meanes consent that Rome-runners, should get their benefices as in former time. In the dayes of Henry the fift, when the Pope by his bulles, translated Richard of Lincolne to Yorke, the Deane and Chapter standing vpon the lawes of the land, refused to admit him, as hereafter shall be declared. Shall wee now say that the kings of England conferre spiritual promotions by the Popes indulgence? let king Edward the first be witnesse: let the Parliament in the raigne of Edward the third be witnesse: let the like Parliament in the time of Richard the second, be witnesse: let the Deane and Chapter of Yorke be witnesse: all which were of the Popish religion, and yet referred this to the king, and not to the Pope. Hitherto, that the kings of England vsed Inuestitures.
                  NOw I will prooue that they vsed them lawfully by a double right, as2 Princes, & as Patrons. As Princes, for many reasons: First, if we looke into the old Testament, we find that Salomon set Sadock in the roume of Abiathar: by what authoritie? Verely by the same by which he cast out Abiathar. Which I haue already prooued to be done by the lawful and ordinary power of a Prince. If this be a perpetuall patterne for all posteritie, then the collation of spirituall dignities, is the Princes right. Secondly, it was prophesied of Christian Princes, that they should be Isa. 49. 23 
                     nursing fathers of the Church; therfore it must bee a part of their Princely care to prouide such nurses as shall feede it with the milke of the Gospel. Thirdly, in the new Testament, Concerning the election of pastours, we find neither precept, nor any such example as can bee vrged, for an euerlasting and vnchangeable rule. And if wee look into the practise of the Church, it will appeare that it hath bene disposed of in diuers ages, in diuers maners, according to diuers customes, and positiue lawes of Princes, growing out of the diuersitie of circumstances and occasions. Wherefore it seemeth that the Lord hath left it as a thing indifferent to the discretion of the Church: whereof the Christian Prince is not onely a part, but Supreame gouernour vnder Christ; in which respect though hee were not Patron, he hath a transcendent and supereminent power, so that the Soueraigne direction and moderation of the matter belongeth vnto him. Which was acknowledged to be the kings right, euen in the time of Popery, as may appeare by the practise: for after the death of any incumbent of any Church with cure, if the Patron presented not within sixe monethes, the Bishop of that Diocesse might bestow it, to the end the cure should not bee destitute of a pastour: if he neglected the time appointed, the Metropolitane of that Diocesse might aduāce one to that Church; & if he also should leaue the Church destitute, by the space limitted vnto him, then it belonged to the king and not to the Bishop of Rome to prouide a competent pastour for that Church. Thus it is euident that though Churches had Patrons to prouide Pastours for them according to the kings Lawes; and Bishops and Archbishops to see it sufficiently done, yet in case of neglect, the care of it was deuolued to the King, as being Supreme gouernour euen in these cases within his own Dominiōs. If you say that this was by the grant of the Pope, the contrary is manifest, because in the 25. of Edward the 3. in the noble statute of prouisours, the Bishop of Rome is said to vsurpe the Seignories of such possessions and benefices. Wherefore the Lawes of the land, and the ancient custome of the

Kingdome concurring with the generall practise of Princes, receiued with the applause of the whole Christian world, doe sufficiently proclaime the right of our Princes in this behalfe; especially seeing as K William Rufus truly said, Mat. Par. p. 17. 
                     The king of England hath all the liberties in his Kingdome, which the Emperour challenged in the Empire. Hitherto of the right of Princes, as they are Princes. Now of their right as they are Patrons.
                  IN Patronages, we may consider two things, The causes and the effects,3. The causes originally inducing the Church of God to approoue them, were three. First, because Princes and Lords of the soile, out of their deuotion and charitable bounty, gaue some of their owne ground for the situation of Churches, and the habitation of Ministers, resigning their owne right into the hands of the Bishop of the Diocesse, and so dedicating it euerlastingly to the Lord. Secondly, because vpon that ground they built Churches for holy meetings, and dwelling places for the messengers of the Lord. Thirdly, because they allowed maintenance, both for the Church and the Minister, as is expressed in this verse: {Glossa in. 16. q. 
                              •

                  The effects of Patronage are three, Glossa ibid. 
                     Honos, Onus, and Vtilitas; The first is Honos, honour of nominating and presenting a fit Clerke; the honour of precedency in sitting in his owne Church; and in some places, to great personages, the honour of Procession; For example, to the 
                     Lancel Instit. Iur. Canon. l. 1. pag. 204. 
                     Duke of Venice in the Church of S. Marke. The second is Onus, a burden; for in being a Patron, hee vndertaketh the Protection of that Church. The third is, Vtilitas, profit; for if he or his children fall into pouerty, they must be releeued out of the reuenues of the same Church; An example whereof happened in a noble citizen of 
                     Lancel. ibid. 
                     Perusia. These prerogatiues of Patrons, were all anciently approoued both by Ciuill and Canon Law. But to passe ouer the rest, I will onely single out the prerogatiue of presenting. In the 9. Conc. Tol. 9. c. 2. Bin. t. 2. p. 1163. Councell of Toledo holden in the yeere 655. it was decreed as followeth, As long as the founders of Churches remaine aliue, they shall bee suffered to haue the chiefe care in those places, and they shall offer fit Rectours vnto the Bishop to be ordained in the same Churches; And if the Bishop while the Founder liueth, shall despise them, and presume to ordaine Rectours in the same place, Let him know that his Ordination shall be voide, and to his shame others shall be ordained, whom the Founders shall chuse. And before that, in the yeere 541. Iustinian made this Constitution, That No

                        el. const.

                     if any man will build an house of prayer, and hee or his heires will haue Clerkes to be promoted therein, if they allow maintenance for those Clerkes, and name such as are worthy, let those which are named be ordained. Now to apply this to our present purpose; It is a cleare case, that all the Bishopricks in England were founded by the Kings Ancestours; And therefore the Aduousons of them all belong to the King. And it is cleare by the Lawes of the land, That See B. Bilson, perpet. gouernment. c. 15. p. 264. 
                     our Kings haue had, and ought to haue the custodie of the same in the Vacancy, and the presentments and collations of those Prelacies as Lords, and Aduowes of all the lands and possessions, that belong either to Cathedrall Churches, or Bishops. Vpon all these premises, this conclusion followeth, that this right we speake of belongeth to our Princes, as Patrons, by Ciuil, Canon, and the common Lawes of the land. To these two former respects, we may adde a third, drawne from this consideration, that our Bishops by the fauour of Princes, are Spiritual Lords and Barons in Parliament, and therefore it were very hard if men

of so great power and place, should be Vide Epis. Eliens. in resp. ad Apol. Bel. c. 6. p. 151. obtruded vpon the Prince without his consent. Hitherto of the lawfull right of Princes.
                  ANd as they haue the collation of Bishopricks most lawfully, so they conferre them most fitly, most freely, and most safely. Most fitly, because4. they haue largest scope to choose, best meanes to discerne, greatest power to procure and assist such as are most eminent for learning and vertue. Most freely, because they are farther from suspition of corruption, then either people, or Prelate. For to vse the words of a reuerend Bishop Bilson perpet. gouernment. c. 18. p. 350. Bishop, Howsoeuer ambitious heads, and couetous hands, may lincke together vnder colour of commendation to deceiue and abuse Princes eares, yet reason and duetie bindeth mee and all others, to thinke and say, that Princes persons are of all others farthest from taking money for any such respects. In meaner persons more iustly may corruption be feared, then in Princes, who of all others haue least need, and so least cause to set Churches to sale. Their abundance, their magnificence, their conscience, are suerties for the freedome of their choice. These are the sayings of the learned Bishop; among which he interlaced a memorable example of Guntchrannus King of France, who, when one offered him money for a Bishoprick, returned this answere; It is not our Princely maner to sell Bishopricks for money, neither is it your part to get them with rewards, lest wee be infamed for silthy gaine, and you compared to Simon Magus. A fit Embleame for a Prince, and worthy to be written in letters of Gold. Most safely; for how dangerous a thing it is to commit such matters to popular Elections, the Primitiue Church had lamentable experience. What vprores also followed the Elections by the Clergie alone, let the longest Schisme that euer was in the Church of Rome testifie. And for the Popes prouisions whereby hee hath incroached vpon the Princes right, they haue bene such as haue giuen both Kings, Nobles, Clergie and people, iust cause of lamentation. But since the nomination rested in the Princes hands, all tumults and grieuances (Gods Name be blessed) are vtterly extinguished. Now I will adde a word or two, of their singular moderation in this behalfe. In ancient time our Kings had the collation before free Election was granted, as was declared out of the Statute of Edward the 3. whereby it is manifest that they had then in themselues a plenarie power. And though this were not without presidents of former ages; yet as Charles the Great granted freedome of Elections vnto the Church, so haue our Princes established the like by the Lawes of the land, according to which they proceed most mildly and graciously, doing all things agreeably to the patterne of famous Princes, and laudable Canons of ancient Councels. With vs the King hath the nomination of Bishops, and so had good Sozom. l. 7. cap. 8. 
                     Theodosius as was plainely to bee seene in the aduancing of Nectarius. With vs the Deane and Chapter make the election of their Bishop: and so did the Hierom. ad Euag. Epist. 85. Presbyters of Alexandria, in Saint Ieroms time, which custome had continued there euer since the time of Saint Marke the Euangelist. With vs the Deane and Chapter elect him, whom the king hath nominated: So the Sozom. ibid. Clergie of Constantinople, with the whole generall Councell there assembled, did thinke it their duetie solemnely to elect Nectarius whom the Emperour had nominated. With vs the electours signifie their election to the king, humbly crauing his royall assent: so the Romane Ex Onuphr. annot. in Plat in Pel. 2. Clergie 1000. yeeres agoe did vse to signifie their election to the Emperour, that he might ratifie it

by his Imperiall authority. And because the ancient Canons giue the power of confirmation to the Conc. Nic. 1. C

Monkes then at Rome vnder paine of a curse, to chuse Steuen Langton a Cardinal, which they did, and brought him vnto the Altar, with a Te deum. The king proclamed those Monkes traytors, the rest that lurked at Canterb: hee prescribed and banished; he forbad Steuen Langton to come into England, and confiscated the goods and lands, both of the Archbishoprik & of the Church of Canterb: whereupon the Pope authorised certaine Bishops to interdict the kingdome, excommunicated the king, set out a sentence declaratory to depriue him, and committed the execution of it to Philip the French king By which papall meanes bereaft of the loue of his people, abandoned of his nobles, hated of his Clergie, forsaken of his friends, behold hee hoped for some comfort at the Popes hand, but finding none, hee was forced so much as in him lay to resigne his kingdoms to Pope Innocent (such is the innocency of Popes) and to farme thē again at a 1000. marks by the yere.

                  The like suite was commensed in France by another of the Popes Legates to whom the Proctour of the Archbishop of Lions answered. Antiq. Brit▪ pag. 161. 
                     That it was not possible that this grant should fill the gulfe of the Romane couetousnesse, because plenty of riches did alwaies make the Romans madde. And the councell of France did thus answere the Legate; Let the zeale of the whole Church and of the holy Romane See mooue you: because if there should bee a generall oppression of all men, it might bee feared, least there should houer ouer our heads a generall departure, which God forbid.

                  Anno 1232. a sort of armed men, with their faces couered, set vpon the barnes of a certaine Romane; and sold out the corne to the country, and gaue much of it to the poore. For which the Bishop of London, with other tenne Bishops did strike the authours with an anathema. Notwithstanding, the same yeere the barnes of the Romanes almost through all England were robbed, the authour whereof, was one Sir Robert

If any resisted, they would procure hee should bee excommunicated: so it came to passe, that where noble and daintie Clergy men, Gardians and Patrons of Churches did vse with their riches to honour the countrey round about them, to entertaine passengers, to refresh the poore, these base persons voide of good manners, and full of subtiltie, Proctors and Farmers of the Romanes, scraping whatsoeuer was precious and profitable in the land, sent it into farre countries to their Lords liuing delicately of Christes patrimonie, and proud with other mens goods. Therefore a man might see, sorrow of heart water the eye-lids of holy men, complaints breake out, and groanes multiplied, many saying with bloody sighes, It is better for vs to die, then to see the miseries of our countrie, and of holy men.

But the Archbishop afterward did grant vnto it.

                  Anno 1241. Pope Gregory sent to the Couent of Burge an Apostolicke mandate with

                     armed prayers that they should conferre vpon the Pope the reuenue of some Church worth 100. markes by the yeere, and if it were 200. it should please him the better, and that they should farme it of the Pope paying him his 100. markes, and take to themselues the ouerplus. The Abbot signified the matter to the King, who detesting the couetousnesse of the Romane Court, did strictly forbid it, least so foule a fact should pollute the ayer.

Emperour.
                  Anno 1244 Innocent the fourth, the new Pope sent Pag. 594. 
                     Martin a new prouler into England armed with the Popes authenticall instrument, and power to suspend and excommunicate all that gaine said him. Hee disdaining trifles would haue no benefice vnder thirtie Markes by the yeere: Hee exacted goodly Palfryes very imperiously, and suspended the Abbot of Malmesbury, and the Prior of Marton, for denying him, and when a rich Prebend of Salisbury belonging to the Chanter was vacant, he presently layed violent hands vpon it, and by the commandement of the Pope conferred it vpon a child the Popes nephew. Yea, Matthew Paris saith, Pag. 603. 
                     Romana curia, rubore deposito, tempore noui Papae nostri Innocentij quarti, non desinebat per prouisiones quotidianas redditus impudenter extorquere. that is; The Romane Court without all blushing, in the time of our new Pope Innocent the fourth ceased not impudently to extort reuenues by daily prouisions. Wherevpon

the king writ to the Pope, but little good came of it. For Martin the Legate required at least of the Prelates Pag. 622. 10000. markes; but they did not grant it. Then he vsed vnheard of extortions of money, and reuenewes, to be bestowed of the kinsmen of his lord the Pope, for hee was supposed to haue bulles with blankes to serue for all purposes. Moreouer, he would send to such an Abbot, or such a Prior, for goodly 
                     Pag. 626. 
                     Palfreys, and presents for the furnishing of his table, and prouision for his robes; and when he had them, hee would send them backe againe, and send for other, and for better, pretending that the former were not sufficient; and suspended all from the Collations of benefices of thirtie markes and vpward, till hee was satisfied. Whereupon saith Matthew Paris: 
                     Ibidem. 
                     Miseri Anglici acerbiorem quàm olim subierunt filij Israel, se doluerunt in Aegypto Britannica tolerare seruitutem: that is, The miserable English men, lamented that they suffered a bondage in the Brittish Aegypt, more cruell, then the children of Israel did in times past.
                  
                  Anno 1245. The Nobles and Canons, sent a Pag. 646. supplication, which was red openly before Pope Innocent, in the Councell at Lyons: wherein they complained, that an infinite number of Italians, had benefices in England, which knew not their flocke, but onely receiued the fruites, and caryed them out of the Realme, and that the yeerely rents of Italians in England, amounted to Ibid. 647. 
                     threescore thousand markes & vpward, which was more then the reuenewes of the Crowne: and that after the Creation of Innocentius, they hoped for reliefe, but were now vnmeasurably oppressed by Martin the Legate, who entred the land without the kings licence; with greater power then euer did Legate, and did exceed excessiuely. Some benefices now voide he gaue to Italians, who dying (the Patrons not knowing) he thrusteth other Italians into their places: others he assigneth before hand to Italians, others he reserueth to the See Apostolicke, wresting from religious persons immoderate pensions, excommunicating and suspending those that contradict him.
                  Anno 1246. Pope Pag. 674. 675. 
                     Innocent, sent priuiledges from the Councel at Lyons that if Englishmen would be studious, especially the sonnes of Noble men, he would dispence with them honourably, for pluralitie of benefices, Promising that Martin the, Clerke of his Exchequer, should prouide but for twelue more: and that then it should be lawfull for Patrons to present fit persons: and that no Italian should immediately succeed an Italian. This the Pope promised, but performed nothing, insomuch that the king did shew in open Parliament articles of 
                     Pag. 677. 678. 679. 
                     grieuances, as in other points, so euen in these which the Pope had promised: for Italians still succeeded Italians; the Popes factor prouided for more then twelue: neither were the Patrons permitted to present. Whereupon letters of grieuances were sent vnto the Pope, first from the Bishops, secondly from the Abbots, thirdly from the Nobles, with the whole Clergy and people, fourthly, from the King himselfe; the copies of all which are in Matthew Paris: and still there came to the king, complaints vpon complaints, of iniuries receiued from the Court of Rome. Yea and there came fresh letters from the Pope, that the English Clergie should find him 
                     Pag. 680. 
                     souldiers, with horse and armour, some fiue, some tenne, some fifteene, and pay them their wages for one whole yeere.
                  
                  The same yeare the Pope espying certaine Pag. 683. 
                     aurifrisia, beautifull to be hold among the Ecclesiasticall ornaments, of some English men, being then

at Rome, asked where they were made: they answered in England. Then the Pope said, Quo supra. 
                     Vere hortus noster deliciarum est Anglia: veré puteus inexhaustus est, & vbi multa abundant multa possunt extorqueri. that is, England is truely our garden of delights: it is truely a Well neuer drawne drie: where many things abound, many things may be wrested from thē. So the Pope intised with the concupiscence of his eyes, sent to almost all the Abbots of the Cistercian order in England, to send him some of them, as though they should haue cost them no money: which disliked not the Londoners, who made and sold them at their owne pleasures. Whereupon many detested the open couetousnes of the Church of Rome. Yet this same Pag. 684. yeere by the industry of the kin̄gs Proctours in the Court of Rome, it was brought to passe, that whereas before the Pope made his prouisions indefinitely, of Ecclesiasticall liuings, to the vse of Italians, Now by the grace of God, the tempest was so calmed, that if henceforth, the Pope would prouide for his Nephewes, or Cardinalles, Hee or his Cardinals should intreate the King that it would please him to prouide for such.
                  
                  About the same time the Pope hearing, that Robert de 
                     Pag 685. 
                     Hales, Archdeacon of Lincolne, dying intestate, left to secular men, many thousand markes, with great store of Plate; and that Almarick Archdeacon of Bedford, died also very rich; and that Iohn Archd. of Northamton, dyed worth fiue thousand markes, besides thirty pieces of plate and infinite Iewels: Hereupon he made a strange decree, not without note of manifest couetousnesse, to be proclaimed in England, that if from thenceforth any Clerke should die intestate, his goods should be turned to the vse of the lord the Pope: the execution of which mandate he committed to the preaching Fryers and Minorites, but the king hearing of it, detesting the couetousnesse of the Romane Court, forbade it as preiudiciall to him and his Realme.
                  
                  The same yeere, the Pope sent to the Bishops of England, for a tallage of sixe 
                     Pag. 686. 
                     thousand marke: The Bishop of Norwich, the Popes prowler in this behalfe, wrote to the Abbot of S. Albans for 80. marke: the king Ibidem. forbad him to pay, and charged the Bishop of Norwich, and other Bishops, not to proceed in that exaction, as they desired to keepe their Baronies holden of the King. Thus the Church of England, was miserably torne and ground betweene the King and the Pope, as betweene two 
                     Pag. 687. 
                     milstones moouing contrary wayes. Yet the same yeere, the courage of the king relented, and he suffered the Church to be spoiled of the sixe thousand marke. Then the Pope more Pag. 694. bolde then euer before, gaue in charge to all the prelates of England, that all beneficed men, if they were residents, should pay the Pope the third part, if non residents, halfe of their goods; but the king forbad the payment, and the Clergie rendred many reasons why it was vnreasonable.
                  Anno 1247. There was holden a Pag. 698▪ 699. Parliament at London, wherin were lamentable complaints of the Popes extortion, and it was concluded, that letters should be sent to the Pope, in the name of the whole kingdome: which was d

                     ne, and they obtained only this, that when the Pope was to make prouision here for his Nephewes or Cardinalls, he should aske the king leaue.
                  
                  The same yeere there came two Pag. 700. English Friers Minorites, with the Popes Bulls, and got great summes of money: they demaunded of the Diocesse of Lincolne 6000. marke: the same yeere there was a Parliament, and the Clergie granted to the Pope 
                     Pag. 707. 
                     11000. markes.
                  
                  
                     The same yeere the Pag. 729. grieuances were much increased: for the Prelates were suspended from Collation of Benefices, till the greedines of the Romanes were satisfied.
                  
                  Anno 1252. the Bishop of Lincolne caused a true account to be made of the reuenues of strangers in England, and it was found to be more then Pag. 832. 70000. markes.
                  Anno 1253. Robert Bishop of Lincolne sent to the Pope this Pag. 843. Epistle following, Let your wisdome know, that I obey the Apostolicke Mandates, with a filiall affection, deuoutly and reuerently; And being zealous of my Fathers honour, I am contrary and opposite to those things which are contrary to the Mandates Apostolicke. For I am bound to both by the Mandate of God. Apostolicke Mandates neither are, or can be other then the doctrines of the Apostles, and of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Master and Lord of the Apostles: For the Lord Iesus Christ saith, He that is not with me, is against me; But the diuine Holinesse of the Apostolicke See, neither is or can be against him. Therefore the tenour of the aforesaid Letter is not consonant to Apostolicke Holines, but a thing much dissonant and disagreeing. First, because from this Addition Non obstante, annexed to this and such like Letters which are dispersed farre and wide, and not induced with any necessitie of the Law of Nature, which is to be obserued, there flowes a whole deluge of inconstancie, boldnesse, malepertnesse, immodestie, lying, deceiuing, distrusting, and all vices thereupon insuing: where of the number is infinite, shaking and disturbing the puritie of Christian Religion, and the tranquillitie of humane societie. Moreouer, after the sin of Lucifer, which shall also be the sinne of Antichrist, the child of perdition, whom the Lord shall destroy with the breath of his mouth, There is not, nor cannot be any other kinde of sinne, so aduerse and contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and Euangelists, and to our Lord Iesus Christ, so hatefull, so detestable, and so abominable, as to kill and destroy soules, by defrauding them of the Office and Ministerie of the Pastorall charge. Which sinnes they are knowne by most euident testimonies of holy Scripture to commit, which being placed in the power of Pastorall charge, doe get the wages of the Pastorall Office and Ministerie, arising of the milke and wooll of the sheepe of Christ, which ought to be quickened and saued, and do not minister such things as are due vnto them. For the very not administration of Pastorall Offices, is by the testimony of Scripture, the killing and destruction of the sheepe. And to passe ouer the rest, because it is somewhat long, I will onely adde his conclusion. And briefly recounting, I say, the Holinesse of the See Apostolicke, can onely doe such things as tend to edification, and not to destruction. For this is the fulnesse of power, to be able to doe all things to edification But these things which they call Prouisions, are not for edification, but for most manifest destruction. Therefore the blessed See Apostolicke cannot accept of them, because flesh and blood (which shall not possesse the Kingdome of Heauen) hath reuealed them, and not the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ which is in Heauen. When this Letter came to the audience of the Pope, he being not able to containe himselfe, said, Pag. 844. 
                     Who is this dotish, surd, absurd oldman, that with such rash presumption iudgeth our acts? By S. Peter, and S. Paul, if my goodnature did not stay me, I should hurle him into such a cōfusion, that he should be the fable of the world▪ an astonishment, an example, a wonderment. Is not the King of England our 
                     O Antichristian pride, and impudencie. 
                     vassall, or to say more, our slaue, who is able at our becke to imprison him, and to make him a slaue to shame and reproch? But the Cardinals said vnto him, Ibidem. 
                     Our good L. it were not expedient that we should decree any hard matter against the Bishop; for that
                     
                     we may confesse the trueth) those things which he saith are true, we cannot condemne him, he is a Catholicke, yea and a most holy man, more Religious then we, and more holy then we, more excellent, and of a more excellent life; so that he is supposed among all the Prelates of the world, not to haue his better, nor his equall. The whole Clergie of France and England knoweth so much. The trueth of such an Epistle which peraduenture is already knowne to many, will be able to moue many against vs: for he is counted a great Pilosopher, perfitly learned in Greeke and Latin, a zealous louer of righteousnes, a reader in schooles of Diuinitie, a preacher among the people, a louer of chastitie, a persecuter of Symonists. These things said Aegidius Hispanus the Cardinall: and others whose conscience did touch them, gaue councell to the Pope, that he should wincke and dissemble the matter, lest some tumult should be raised vpon this occasion, especially because it is wel knowne, that once there shal a departure come. The same Robert lying vpon his death-bed, sighing, said thus, Pag. 847. Christ came into the world to gaine soules: therefore if any man be not afraid to destroy soules, is not he worthily called Antichrist? The Lord in 6. dayes made the whole world, but he laboured more then 30 yeeres to repaire man; Is not therefore this destroyer of soules, worthy to be iudged an enemy of God, and an Antichrist? The Pope blusheth not impudently to disanull the priuiledges of former Popes his predecessors, by this barre Non obstante, which is not done without their preiudice and manifest iniurie: for so he pulls downe that, which so great and so many Saints haue builded. Behold the contempt of Saints: therefore the contemner shall iustly be contemned, according to that of Esay, Woe to thee which despisest, shalt thou not be despised? who will obserue his priuiledges? The Pope answering, doth thus defend his errour: An equall hath no authority ouer an equall: therefore a Pope cannot binde me being a Pope, &c. And againe, Although many other Apostolicke men haue afflicted the Church, yet hee hath compeld it to be in bondage more grieuously then others, and hath multiplied inconueniences. For the Caursini being manifest Vsurers, which the holy Fathers and our doctors haue driuen out of France, this Pope hath raised vp and protected in England, and if any speake against them, he is tired out with losses and labours; Witnes Roger B. of London. The world knoweth, that Vsury is accounted detestable in both Testaments, and is forbidden of God; but now the Merchants of my L. the Pope, do practise Vsury openly at London, they contriue diuers grieuances against Ecclesiasticall and Religious persons, forcing poore men to lye, and to set their Seales to lying writings. As for example, I receiue so many marks by yeere for an 100. pound, and am forced to make a writing, and sealè it, in which I confesse my selfe to haue receiued an 100. pound to be payed at the yeeres end. And if peraduenture thou wouldest pay the Popes Vsurer the principall againe within a moneth or fewer dayes, he will not receiue it, vnlesse thou wilt pay the whole hundred pound. Which condition is heauier then any which is required of the Iewes: for whensoeuer thou shalt bring a Iew his principall, he will take it kindly, with so much gaine, as is answerable to the time, &c. And againe, We haue seene one of the Popes Letters, wherein this clause was inserted, That such as made their Testaments, or caried the Crosse, or yeelded ayde to the Holy-land, should receiue so much pardon for their sinnes, as they gaue money. And wee know our lord the Pope, wrote vnto the Abbot of S. Albans, that he should prouide for a certaine man called Iohn de Camezana, in a competent benefice, and shortly prouision was made in a Church worth fortie marks by the yeere: but he not content therewithall complained vnto the Pope, who wrote to the same Abbot to prouide more bountifully
                     
                     for him, and yet the Pope reserued the donation of the former benefice vnto him selfe. And to passe ouer other things, the Pope graunted for secular fauour, that one may obtaine a Bishoprick, and not bee a Bishop but an euerlasting elect, which is as much to say as that he should receiue the milk and the wooll of the sheepe, and yet not driue away the wolues. Mathew

                     Paris telleth how this Bishop Robert Grosthead hated all kind of Enormities to wit, all kind of Couetousnesse, al Vsury, Symony, and Rapine, all kinde of Riot, Lust, Gluttony and Pride, which so raigned in that Court, that this iudgement was iustly giuen of it:
                  
                     Eius auaritiae totus non sufficit orbis,
                     Eius Luxuriae meretrix non sufficit omnis.

In the end of this propheticall speech, which hee could scarcely vtter for sighs, teares, and groanes bursting out, his tongue faultred, his breath failed, and the organes of speech decaying, imposed silence.

                     Tag. 939. 
                     Iesus Christ, of Iudges most iust, thy infallible iudgement knoweth, how manifouldly the Pope, whom thou hast suffered to be set ouer thy Church to gouerne it, hath wearied mine Innocency, for this cause as God knoweth, and the world is not ignorant, that I would not admit to the gouernment of Churches (which thou hast committed to mee though vnworthy) such as were altogether vnmeete & vnknowne. Notwithstanding, least the Popes sentence although in it selfe vniust, should be made iust by my contempt, I being intangled with such bands (that is papall censures) doe humbly desire to bee absolued But I appeale to the Pope himselfe before the high and incorruptible Iudge, and heauen and earth shalbe my witnesses how vniustly hee hath assaulted mee, and
                     
                     how oft he did scandalize and prouoke me. Thus in the bitternesse of his soule hee wrote vnto the Pope, prouoked by the example of Robert of Lincolne, humbly intreating him, that hee would mittigate the vsuall tyrranies by following the humilitie of his holy Predecessors, and vsed these words Ibidem. 
                     Dixit dominus Petro, Pasce oues meas, non tonde, non excoria, non euiscera, vel deuorando consume, that is, The Lord said to Peter, feed my sheepe, hee said not vnfleese them, nor flea them, nor vnbowel them, nor consume them by deuouring. But the Pope scorned these admonitions that were so holy.

                     VVe doubt not but it is come to publike knowledge, after what maner from the beginning of the Church, when it had the first birth in our Kingdome of England, the anciēt stock of famous memory of our progenitours Kings of England, and of the nobles and faithfull people of the said kingdome, for the exercise of diuine worship built Churches and endowed them with ample possessions, and fenced them with priuileges, placing in thē fit ministers which happily set forward Catholike faith, in languages & people subiect vnto them, by whose care & diligence the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, was then very fertil in beauty and fruit: But (which is to bee lamented) the plants of that vineyard are degenerated into wildshrubs, and the beares of the wood roote it out, & wild beasts deuoure it, while by impositions and prouisions of the See Apostolike which grow more grieuous thē they were accustomed, the hands of vnworthy persons, & especially of strangers seize vpon the Lords inheritance, contrary to the godly will, & ordination of the donors, & the dignities thereof, & fat benefices are conferred vpō persons, born out of the Land, many times suspected vnto vs, which are not resident vpō the same benefices, & know not the faces of the sheep cōmitted vnto thē, nor vnderstood their language, but neglecting the cure of souls, like hierlings seek only temporal gaine, & by this means the worship of Christ is diminished, the cure of souls neglected, hospitality is withdrawn, the rights of Churches are lost, the houses of Clerkes are ruinated, the deuotion of the people is lessened, Clerkes of the kingdome, men of great learning and honest conuersation, which might well performe the charge and gouernment, and were fit men for

                     Iubile, promising remission of sinnes to all that went to Rome, or redeemed their iourney with money, and at the same time to make them more liberall hee gaue out, that there should bee a great expedition against the Turkes, and that the Pope would goe thither in person as the Generall of the field. The Popes Proctor in England for this purpose was Gasper a Spaniard, who in fewe moneths got great summes of money

which so soone as the couragious Captaine Pope Alexander had receiued, he let the warres alone, and followed his pleasures. This yeere of Iubile was indeede to England a yeere of Iubile, for it brought to Englishmen so often vexed, an end of Papal exactions and robberies. Yet there remained a tribute of smoke for him that had fed them so long with smoke.

                     THree things concurre in making of a Bishop by Diuine and Canon Law, to wit, Election, Confirmation and Consecration. Now howsoeuer Bishops were elected; the confirmation must proceede from the Bishop of Rome, or some Metropolitane vnder him, which hath commission from him, or else they can haue no iurisdiction.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The confirmation of Bishops was a godly constitution, for the auoyding of Schisme, concerning which the Fathers of the famous Conc. Nic. Can. 4. Bin. tom 1. pag. 366. 
                     Nicen Councel haue ordained, that through all Prouinces it shall belong to the Metropolitane; they say not to the Pope, but to the Metropolitane; but all the Bishops of England are confirmed by their Metropolitanes: And that by most lawfull and orderly proceeding. For when the Deane and Chapter by licence from the King haue made the election, certified it vnder their common seale, and thereunto haue obtained the royall assent, the Metropolitane with other Bishops by commission from the King, proceedeth to confirme it according to the Canons, sending out a publicke and peremptorie citation to summon all personally to appeare, which can obiect any thing either against the partie elected, or the forme of election. And when after due examination, and iudiciall processe, they are both found consonant to the ancient Canons, he confirmeth the election; Thus it is cleare that all the Bishops of England haue Canonicall confirmation: and withall that the Pope in challenging this vnto himselfe, transgresseth the Canon, and vsurpeth the right of the Metropolitane.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Your Metropolitanes haue no such power because they are not confirmed themselues by the Bishop of Rome.

                     Frumētius from him, whom Athanasius sent to be Bishop in India? What confirmation had Flauianus from him, against whom three Bishops of Rome opposed themselues; yet he kept his Chaire many yeeres, and all the

                     Theod. l. 5. c. 23. 
                     communicated with him. What confirmation had the Bishops of Conc. Eph. 1. Bin. c. 1. p. 768. Cyprus from him, which were not vnder the Iurisdiction of any Patriarch, but gouerned by a Synod of their owne?

                  THat all the Bishops in the world, should deriue their confirmation2 frō him, may appeare by this, that the Patriarches themselues were not exempted, but did shew their faith vnto him, and were confirmed by him: as for example, De Nectario etiam ab vniuerso concilio electo, a Damaso tamen confirmando. Stap. prin. doct. l. 4. c. 20.

                      the second Councell of Constantinople, being summoned to the Councell of Rome by the letters of Theodosius the Emperour, wrote to Damasus, Ambrose, and the rest of the Bishops assembled at Rome, to excuse their not comming, in respect of the state of their Churches whch had so lately beene pestered with Heresies, and stood stil in such termes that the Bishops could not leaue them without extreme danger. Yet they thought good to send three Bishops in the name of the rest; and withall they make relation both of their doctrine & discipline. Concerning their doctrine, they declare their faith of the Vnitie, Trinitie, and natures of Christ. Concerning discipline, they declare that they choose their Bishops & Patriarches according to the Canons of the Nicen Councell: and so speake of the election of Nectarius, Patriarch of Constantinople, Flauianus Patriarch of Antioch, and Cyrill Patriarch of Ierusalem. Concerning Nectarius, whose example you vrge, they say, that he being a most reuerend, and zealous man, was chosen in their generall Councell, in the presence of the Emperour with the generall applause of all, both Clergie and people. And this they write not to Damasus alone, as though it were in his power, to make or to marre the election: (they were farre from any such cogitation) but to him with the rest to reioyce him and the rest, by relating their consent in faith and loue. So they desire not Damasus onely, but Ambrose and all the rest, to reioyce with them, and to giue their cheerefull assent, that the Christian faith being agreed vpon, and loue confirmed among them, they might keepe the Church from schismes and dissensions. Thus though they name Damasus first, and giue him preeminence of place; yet they giue no more preeminence of power to the Bishop of Rome, then to the Bishop of Millen.

                  As the Patriarch of Rome, did not allow the other Patriarches for lawfull, till they had signified by letters, their soundnesse in faith: so the other Patriarches, did not acknowledge the Patriarch of Rome, till they were likewise informed of his faith. And therefore the Patriarches of Rome, did vse to send the like Synodall letters to the other Patriarches, as may appeare by Greg. l. 1. Ep. 24.

                     For as much as a certaine obseruation, or rather an Apostolicall tradition hath long preuailed in the Churches, that those which had newly beene taken into the degree of some eminent Priesthood, should declare their faith to them which had obtained the like degree of eminent Priesthood long time before them; Therefore it seemeth good to me both to submit myselfe vnto you, and to declare manifestly before you, the confession of my faith. Wherefore this practise doth not mount one Patriarch aboue the rest, but rather leuell all of them in an equalitie; and consequenly the Bishop of Rome had no more power ouer the Metropolitanes of other Patriarches, then other Patriarches ouer his.

Lateran, in the presence of the Pope, an Archbishop in a Sermon speaking of a Pope, said, He had power aboue all power, in heauen and in earth. What say you? Did the Pope and Councell approue this blasphemie? for they did not reproue it. If their silence was no argument of approbation, then neither was the silence of the Councell of Chalcedon. Yea it is most certaine that they neither did vse it, nor approue it. In the sixteenth Action they write a Synodall Epistle to Pope Leo, at which time, if euer, it was fit that they should adorne him with this title, which notwithstanding they vsed not, but stiled him Apud Bin. t. 2. pag. 139.

                     Bishop may be taken two wayes; First for him, which is the onely Bishop of the whole world, excluding all other, in which sence Greg. l. 7. Epist. 69. 
                     S. Gregorie saith, If one be an Vniuersall Bishop, it remaineth that you are no Bishops. Secondly, for him that hath a generall care of he whole Church, yet so, that other Bishops retaine their place and dignitie. In the first sence S. Gregory calleth it prophane: In the second, it belongeth to the Bishop of Rome.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Concerning the first, Greg. Epist. l. 4. ep. 38. 
                     Gregorie hauing said, that the name of Vniuersalitie was offered by the Councell, addeth immediatly, That neuer any of his predecessours did vse so prophane a title. So it is cleare, that he calleth that very title, prophane, which as he saith, was offered by the Councell; Which iustifieth my former answere. For vnlesse you will accuse the Councell of prophanenesse, you must needs say, that Gregory speaketh improperly, ascribing that to the Councell, which was onely done by the Popes Legate, and a few supplicants in the Councell. Moreouer, if this prophane title exclude all other from being Bishops, then the Councel (consisting of 630. Bishops,) in giuing this title, should exclude themselues from being Bishops: which is absurd, seeing in their subscriptions they intitled themselues Bishops.

Concerning the second, If he be an vniuersall Bishop which hath care of the whole Church, then S. Paul was Vniuersall Bishop as well as S. Peter: 
                     2. Cor. 11. 28. for he had care of all the Churches. Then Athanasius was an Vniuersall Bishop: for Basil. ad Athanas. Ep. 52. 
                     S. Basill saith, He caried the care of all Churches.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Peraduenture he meaneth, that he caried the care of all within the Patriarchdome of Alexandria.

                  Nor of them onely, but of others also: For S. Basill saith, Epist. 48. 
                     The whole state of the Church of Antioch dependeth vpon thee. So though his iurisdiction was confined within the Patriarchdome of Alexandria, yet he caried a tender care ouer the whole Church of Christ. Wherefore in this sence the title of Vniuersall Bishop, belongeth as well to the Patriarch of Alexandria, as to the Patriarch of Rome. Moreouer, the very title of Vniuersall Patriarch was giuen, and that by a Councell, to Iohn Patriarch of Constantinople. In what sence trow you? You produced but two sences of it out of Bellarmine. In the first, which prophanely excludeth all other Bishops they did not giue it, for then they should deny themselues to be Bishops, contrary to their own subscriptions. If in the latter, then it was common to him with the Bishops of Rome; and so cannot proue your Monarchicall iurisdiction.

                     Binius in the same place ascribeth this to the imposture of the latter Grecians; which he proueth, because, though two Popes, Pelagius and Gregory condemned this title in the Bishop of Constantinople; yet no man obiected against them the authoritie of this Councell, which had beene very materiall, because the greater part of it was approued by the Church of Rome. Wherefore it is certaine that this was not originally in the Councell, but foisted in afterward.

                     It must be affirmed that this also crept in, vnlesse we say that he is called Vniuersall, in respect of the Orientall Bishops and Priests.

                  So Holoander taketh it, when hee translateth it, Vniuersi eius tractus Patriarchae, i. to the Patriarch of all that circuit. But are you now aduised? Was he called Vniuersal, and yet had not the iurisdictiō of the whole world, but was onely an Orientall Patriarch? then you must confesse, that this title might be giuen to the B. of Rome, and yet not imply that hee had iurisdiction ouer the whole world, but ouer the whole West, and so was the Occidentall Patriarch. Wherefore the decree of Pope Pelagius, requiring all Metropolitanes to send to Rome to professe their faith, and receiue the Pall, extendeth not to them of the East, but onely to them of the West.

                  Then you grant that hee was Patriarch of the West, and that is sufficient to inferre my conclusion, for the Westerne Patriarch must needes haue iurisdiction ouer the Metropolitanes of the West, in which compasse is Brittany. I need not here speake of the ancient diuision of the Prouinces, nor of Saint Peter, nor of Eleutherius: It is famously knowne that Saint Austin was sent hither by the Bishop of Rome, receiued a pall from him, and apparently submitted himselfe to his iurisdiction; so did his successours for almost a thousand yeeres together. Wherfore seeing the Bishop of Rome was in lawfull possession, you must tell vs vpon what reason you put him from it.

                  By what title doth the Pope challenge his iurisdiction in England? By the law of God? you See aboue. cap. 2. & 3. cannot iustifie it. By reason of the first conuersion of the Island by Saint Peter? You See lib. 2. c. 2 cannot make it manifest, that euer he was here. Will you fetch it from Eleutherius? He onely sent Bede. l. 1. c. 4. 
                     at the kings request, and challenged no such authority. Wil you deriue it from Austin? 
                     Galfrid. Mon. l. 11. c. 12. It was then made appeare by many reasons that the Brittans ought him no subiection. And it is euident, that he and his associates had first their assemblies in Saint Martins Church in Canterbury, by the Kings permission: afterward, when the king himselfe was conuerted, they receiued (to vse the words of Bede. l. 1. c. 26 
                     Bede) more ample licence both to Preach through all his dominions, and also to build and repaire Churches. So you see all was receiued from the king. It is true that Gregory sent a supply of Preachers, and gaue his aduise for the erection of Bishopricks, and sent palls hither; yet there can bee no question, but all this was done by the kings licence. Afterward in succeeding ages, when the Popes did play the wild boares in the Church, in executing Church censures, and giuing Church liuings, the kings of England made lawes against them, euen in the time of Popery. For as it was defended by Epist. 55.

De appellationibus si emerserint ab Archidiacono debet procedi ad Episcopum, ab Episcopo ad Archiepiscopum, & si Archiepiscopus defuerit in iustitia exhibenda, ad dominum regē perueniendū est postremò, vt praecepto ipsius in curia Archiepiscopi controuersia terminetur, ita quod non debeat vltra procedi absque assenssu domini regis, i.

Thus it is cleare that the Pope could not take to himselfe the handling of causes without the kings license. It might also be declared how little his cēsures were here respected, vnlesse they receiued strength by the kings permission. And whereas hee tooke vpon him to dispose of Church liuings, hee was censured for it in the time of Edw. the 3 euen in the high Court of Parliament as 25. Ed. 3. statute of Prouisours. an vsurper. These points might bee much inlarged, but this little touch is sufficient to shew that whatsoeuer iurisdiction hee had in England, was by the courtesie of the King: whatsoeuer hee tooke vpon him otherwise, was by vsurpation. Now his challenge by custome is repelled by custome. For, these sixe hundred yeeres last past, hee affecting to bee

that which he was not, disdained to bee that which he was, and aspyring to a Popedome neglected his Patriarchdome: so that which he had gotten by vse he hath lost by disusing, and by his owne fact hath extinguished his former title. Secondly, whereas Pope Pelagius required onely a profession of the faith according to the Scriptures and the holy ancient generall councels, Onuphrius in vita Pij. 4. 
                     Pius the fourth hath framed vs a new forme of faith, without which no man can bee saued, consisting of traditions, transubstantiations, merits, Images, reliques, and such rotten Romish ragges-which he hath clapt to the Nicen creed, as it were a beggers patch to a golden garment.

                  There is yet extant an Epistle of a Bishop, which tooke the oth to Saint Gregory, who liued not long after Pelagius.

                  You intend to proue that Metropolitanes should sweare to the Pope before their confirmation, or receiuing of the palle; the example you bring concernes no such matter: For first he was only a Bishop, not a Metropolitan. Secondly, this oth was voluntary, not exacted. Thirdly, it was not vpon a confirmation or receiuing of a palle, but vpon an abiuration of his heresie. Neither doth it appeare, that this oth was in the time of Gregory, though some haue gone about to ascribe it to the time of Pope Pelagius, wherein behold, and you shal see the cunning of Popish proctors. For whereas Distinct. 100. quoniam. 
                     Pelagius reproued some Metropolitanes, because they did delay, fidem suam exponere, and thereupon made this decree that those which did not send within three monthes, ad fidem suam exponendam, should be depriued:

                     Remundus Rufus, a Popish Lawier of Paris writing for the honor of the Pope, doth change these words, ad exponendam fidem, i. To make profession of their faith into dandae fidei causa. i. To make a faithfull promise or oth; so the profession of the faith of Iesus Christ was by a strange Metamorphosis transformed into an oth of the Popes supremacy. Now least the Spanish Lawiers should come short of the French, in shewing their zeale for their Lord the Pope, Resp. de Episc: iurisd. & Pont. autorit. propos. 5. p. 151 
                     Franciscus Vargas king Philips Councellor, and Ambassador to Pope Pius the fourth, affirmeth that Pelagius declared the Popes supremacy by this decree, in that he would haue all Metropolitanes sworne vnto him. Marke what he saith sworne vnto him, whether deceiued by Rufus, or purposing to make an officious lie for his holy Fathers aduantage, I cannot tell. Howsoeuer, this oth cannot bee referred to Pope Pelagius, but rather to Pope Paschall the second, who would haue forced Archbishop Panormitane to take it, and vpon his refusal set out the decret all Epistle, recorded by Gregory the ninth, in the De election

                  It appeareth by the Contents of the Decree, that he was the authour.

Thus he doth not refer the oath to former Popes and Councels but relyeth onely vpon his owne authoritie. So it seemeth that this weede did spring 1100. yeeres after Christ.

Secondly, by Priestes you meane Sacrificing Priestes, and would expound your selues of spirituall Sacrifices, then as this name belongeth to all Christians, so it may bee applied by an excellencie to the Ministers of the Gospell. Thirdly, although in this name you haue a relation to bodily Sacrifices, yet euen so we may bee called Priestes, by way of allusion. For as Deacons are not of the tribe of Leui, yet the ancient fathers doe cōmonly call them Leuites, alluding to their office because they come in place of Leuites: so the ministers of the new Testament may be called Sacrificers, because they suceed the sons of Aaron, and come in

place of Leuites: so the Ministers of the new Testament may be called sacrificers, because they succeed the sonnes of Aaron, and come in place of sacrificers. Fourthly, for as much as we haue authoritie to minister the Sacraments, and consequently the Eucharist, which is a representation of the sacrifice of Christ; therefore we may be said to offer Christ in a mystery, and to sacrifice him by way of commemoration.

For the vnderstanding wherof, we must consider, that Melchisedec, was a type of Christ in a more excellent maner then Aaron, insomuch that Christ is called a Priest, after the order of Melchisedec, and not after the order of Aaron.

                     blood of Christ vnder the forme of Bread and Wine. From which property of the order of Melchisedec we may draw this argument. If Melchisedec did offer an vnbloody sacrifice vnder the forme of Bread and Wine, then seeing Christ is a Priest, after the order of Melchisedec, he also must offer an vnbloody Sacrifice, vnder the formes and shapes of Bread and Wine: but the Sacrifice of the Crosse, was bloody: therefore he offered another Sacrifice besides the Sacrifice of the Crosse: and what can this be, but the Sacrifice of the Supper? But he commaded his Apostles, and in them vs, to doe as hee did, saying, Luke. 22. 19. 
                     doe this in remembrance of me: therfore Christ commanded that we should sacrifice him in an vnbloody manner, in the formes of Bread and Wine, & consequently the Ministers of the Gospel, are Sacrificers by Christs owne institution.

                  We graunt first, that Melchisedec was a type of Christ, because the Scripture saith, Heb. 7. 3. 
                     he was likened to the sonne of God: Secondly, that Christ was a Priest, not after the order of Aaron▪
                      but after the order of Melchisedec, because God hath not only said it, but sworne it: Psal. 110 4. 
                     The Lord hath sworne and will not repent, thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchisedec: but wee deny that Melchisedec did offer any Bread and Wine, for a Sacrifice to God; wee deny that Christ euer offered any such, or euer gaue any such commission to his Apostles. Therefore this is so farre from prouing your pretended Priesthood, that it will quite ouerthrowe it.

                  That Paulo ante is a tricke of a Iesuite, to make the Reader imagine that they had new dined, which is more then can be proued out of the Text. For when Abraham who dwelt in the plaine of Gene. 14. 13. Mamre heard that Lot was taken prisoner, hee pursued the 4. Kings to 
                     Verse 14.

                     Sodom, about 180. miles, where Melchisedec met him. Wherefore, for ought that doeth appeare by the Text, the yong mens eating of the spoiles, might haue bene sundry dayes before Melchisedec met them. But if they had new dined, did Melchisedec know so much? Or if he did, doe you know how long he stayed with them, or what store of victuals they had remayning? And if there had remained great plentie, yet, may not a King giue entertainment to such as are otherwise prouided of victuals? Surely, this is a speech that doeth little become a Cardinall: if Bellarmine be of this opinion, his Cardinalship keepeth but a miserable house, and affordeth but slender hospitalitie. Hitherto we haue seene how weakely you haue disproued the ciuill banquet; Now let vs see how strongly you can proue the Sacred.

                  THat this bread and wine were brought out for sacrifice, may appeare3. by the Text, which saith, Melchisedec Rex Salem proferens panem & vinum, erat enim Sacerdos Dei altissimi, &c. That is, Verse 18. 
                     Melchisedec King of Salem brought foorth bread and wine: for hee was a Priest of the most high God. Why did he bring foorth bread and wine? because he was a Priest of the most high God▪ Now the proper office of a Priest is to sacrifice; therefore the very connexion doeth teach vs, that he brought foorth bread and wine to sacrifice.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  As it was the office of the Priest to sacrifice, so it was his office to blesse: as may appeare in the sixt of Numbers, Verse 23. 
                     Speake vnto Araon, and to his sonnes, saying, Thus shall you blesse the children of Israel, &c. Therefore the Spirit of God hauing said, that Melchisedec was a Priest of the most High God, addeth immediatly, that he blessed him.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  The coniunction (for) doeth euidently shew the dependence. He brought foorth bread and wine, (for) he was a Priest of the most High God: therefore this bringing it forth, was a Priestly action, which must needs import, that it was referred to sacrifice.

                  The Vulgar Translation which you follow, is erronious: for according to the Hebrew it is not, Erat enim Sacerdos: for he was a Priest; but & erat Sacerdos: and he was a Priest, as Arias

causall, but with a copulatiue: therefore your argument drawne from the causall vanisheth away.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  The copulatiue coniunction is much vsed for a causall: as in the Prophet Esay 64. 2. 
                     Esay, where it is according to the Hebrew, Behold thou art angry, and we haue sinned; which your selues translate, Behold thou art angry, for we haue sinned. The like is to be said of the Greeke particle, answering to the Hebrew; As for example, in the words of the Angel, it is according to the Greeke, Luke 1. 42. 
                     Blessed art thou among women, and the fruit of thy wombe is blessed. Vpon which place, In annotat. in vers. suam. 
                     Beza proueth very well, that the copulatiue is put for a causall: and your selues translate it accordingly, Because the fruit of thy wombe is blessed. Likewise in this present place, the copulatiue must be expounded by the causall: as may appeare euen by the Hebrew, which your selues so aduance and magnifie. Bel. quo supr. 
                     For after these words, And he was a Priest of the most High God. There is an accent called Soph pasuk, to signifie that the period is ended. Therefore though wee should reade, And he was a Priest of the most High God: yet because there is a full point, the very words thus pointed according to the Hebrew, Chaldee, Greeke and Latine, would proclaime, that he brought forth bread and wine, as a Priest to sacrifice.

                  In the diuision of the Chapters into verses, there was respect had, not onely of Musicall harmonie, but also of some equalitie or indifferencie in the length of the Verses. So it commeth to passe▪ that sometimes a long sentence extendeth it selfe, and is Buxtorf. thesaur gram. l. 2. c. 23. 
                     continued in diuers verses, before the sense be perfectly concluded. Wherefore though euery Verse haue his Soph pasuk, yet euery Verse is not a full period. As for example, In the 23. of Genesis, after the 17. Verse, there is the same point and accent, which is here; and yet in your owne vulgar Bibles, set out by Sixtus 5. and Clemens octauus, there is but a comma: and that no marueile, seeing sometimes there is onely a comma betweene Chapter and Chapter, As for example, Betweene the 21. and 22. of the Acts, both in the Greeke and in the Latine. Now for this present place of Genesis, In Pagnins translation set out by Vatablus, as also in Gloss. liter. in Genes. 
                     Delrio, yea in the authenticall Edition of Sixtus quintus, and Clemens octauus, the Soph pasuk you vrge, is expressed onely by a comma, and in some of the Vulgar, there is not so much as a comma. Wherefore this doeth rather argue a relation to that which followeth, then to that which went before, and consequently, these words, He was a Priest of the most High God, cannot be referred to the bringing foorth of the bread and wine, but rather to the blessing. And that it is so, may appeare by the Epistle to the Hebrewes, where the Type of Melchisedec is vnfolded: and yet there is no mention at all of sacrificing, but only of blessing▪
                      But if we should suppose, that it were to be translated by the causall, (for) and that these words, For he was a Priest of the most High God, had relation to that which went before, concerning the bringing out of bread and wine, what should you gaine by it?

                  The very point in question. For the latter part shall yeeld a reason of the former. Did Melchisedec bring foorth bread and wine to Abraham? What moued him so to doe? The reason is rendered, because he was a Priest of the most High God; Therefore this was a Priestly action.

                  He gaue entertainment to Abraham, and was thereunto moued

by consideration of his owne Office, euen because hee was not onely a professour of the true Religion, but also a Priest: for as it becommeth all that imbrace Religion, to loue one another, and reioyce at their good; so this duetie especially belongeth to the Priest. And your learned Iesuite And▪ desens▪ de vulg. Edit. p. 637. Colon. 1580.

                  A Type consisteth in representation; and representation dependeth rather vpon the outward accidents, then the inward substance, therfore whereas Melchisedec sacrificed bread and wine, the truth of that Type must consist in the outward accidents: that is, in the formes of bread & wine: and the Type was fulfilled in that Christ offered himselfe in the formes of bread and wine.

                  Was the sacrifice of Melchisedec bread and wine in substance? or was it the body and blood of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine? if you say the first, then our communion doth better answere to the sacrifice of Melchisedec then your Masse: and consequently our ministery doth better resemble his then your Priesthood: but if you say that he offered the very bodie and blood of Christ in the formes of bread and wine; that would fit your turne well, for then Melchisedec should be a Masse Priest; but it is so absurde that you dare not auouch it. For then the very bodie and blood of Christ should haue beene actually and substantially existent, before it was conceiued in the wombe of the Virgin Mary. Thus say what you can, you are quite ouerthrowne.

                  Or rather thus, seeing Christ is a Priest after the Order of Melchisedec, hee must haue all the essentiall properties belonging to that Order: but his sacrifice was bloodie and not vnbloody, for, With his owne

                     he 
                     Heb. 7. 24. 
                     indureth for euer hath an euerlasting Priesthood: he indureth for euer; he euen he, in his owne person: and therefore hath no neede of you to continue his Sacrifice. For Christ is a Priest for euer. First in respect of his owne Sacrifice vpon the Crosse. Secondly, in respect of his intercession. In respect of the Sacrifice, which though it were but once offered, yet it is an euerlasting Sacrifice, because the vertue of it is euerlasting, and continueth effectuall for euer, for as he is the Reuel. 13. 8. 
                     lambe slaine from the beginning of the world, so hee is Iesus Christ 
                     Heb. 13. 8. 
                     yesterday, to day, and the same for euer; 
                     Heb. 9. 12. 
                     neither by the blood of goates and calues, but by his owne blood entred he once into the holy place, and hath obtained an eternall redemption for vs.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  As hee is a Priest properly for euer, so hee must for euer offer a Sacrifice; But he hath no more Sacrifice to offer in his owne person: therefore he must offer it by another.
               
               
                  ORTH.
                  Your owne Anglor. in Heb. 5. 6. 
                     Rhemists affirme that Christ was a Priest from the first moment of his conception. Now what if one should reason thus with you? if he be a Priest, he must offer a Sacrifice: but in the Virgins wombe he offered no Sacrifice, therefore then he was no Priest. Or thus; till he was thirty three yeeres olde he offered no Sacrifice, therefore all that while hee was no Priest, what would you answere?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  I would say that Christ was truely then a Priest, in respect of that Sacrifice of his body and blood which he offered in due time.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  If he were a Priest in the wombe of the Virgin, in respect of that Sacrifice which was then to come; why may hee not bee called a Priest till the end of the world, in respect of the same Sacrifice alreadie offered? and as he is a Priest for euer in respect of his Sacrifice, so he is a Priest for euer in regard of his intercession. For his Priesthood hath two parts, Redemption, and Intercession. It behoued our high Priest first to purchase our redemption by his blood, secondly to applie his precious merits vnto vs by his intercession, and both these are set downe by Saint Iohn: if any man sinne, 
                     1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2. 
                     wee haue an aduocate with the Father Iesus Christ the iust, and he is the Propitiation for our sinnes. Who is our aduocate? euen hee that hath sacrificed his blood a propitiation for our sinnes, hee is our aduocate, and Heb. 9. 24. 
                     appeareth in heauen to make intercession for vs. 
                     Rom. 8. 33. 
                     Who shall now lay any thing to the charge of Gods chosen? it is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne vs? It is Christ which is dead, yea rather which is risen againe, who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh intercession for vs, And seeing we haue a 
                     Heb. 7. 26. 
                     high Priest made higher then the heauens, who euer liueth to make intercession for vs, In this respect he may well be saide to bee a Priest for euer, and needeth not your Massemongers to continue his Sacrifice. Wherefore it is euident that your sacrificing priestood cannot bee grounded vpon the type of Melchisedec. Which may yet appeare more fully, because the Apostle to the Chap. 7. 
                     Hebrewes speaking very particularly of this Type saith not one word cōcerning his Sacrifice, but vnfouldeth it in these branches following. First, Melchisedec signifieth King of righteousnesse, therein being a type of Christ Iesus, who is Ierem. 23. 6. 
                     the Lord our righteousnesse. Secondly, Melchisedec was King of Salem, that is, king of peace: So 
                     Isa 9 6. 
                     Christ Iesus is the Prince of peace: 
                     Ephes. 2. 14. 
                     for he is our peace which hath made of both one, and hath broken the stop of the partition wall, in abrogating through his flesh the hatred, that is, the lawe of commandements which
                     
                     standeth in ordinances, for to make of twaine one new man in himselfe, so making peace. And that hee might reconcile both vnto God in one body by his Crosse, and slay hatred thereby, and came and Preached peace to you which were a farre off, and to them that were neere. Thirdly, Melchisedec was both King and Priest: so was Christ Iesus. Fourthly, Melchisedec blessed Abraham: and the blessing of God commeth through Christ Iesus vpon all the sonnes of Abraham, that is vpon all beleeuers. For we ought all to say with the Apostle, Ephes. 1. 3. 
                     Blessed bee God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath blessed vs with all spirituall blessing in heauenly things in Christ. Fifthly, Melchisedec receiued tithes of Abraham, and consequētly, euen Leui being as yet in the loines of Abraham payed tithes to Melchisedec; Whereby was signified that the Priesthood of Christ who was after the order of Melchisedec, was farre more excellent then the Priesthood of Aaron. Sixtly, Melchisedec was without father, without mother, without kindred, not simply, but is said to be so, in respect of the silence of the Scripture which bringeth him in sodenly, making no mention at all of father, mother, or kinred, thereby representing Christ Iesus, who as he was man, had no father; as he was God had no mother nor kinred. Seuenthly, Melchisedec had neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life: That is, the Scripture doth not mention the one nor the other, that therein hee might bee a representation of the eternitie of Christ Iesus, who as hee is God, is from euerlasting to euerlasting. Thus the Scripture vnfoldeth the type of Melchisedec, plentifully and particularly, and yet saith not one word concerning his sacrificing, which is an euident argument that it is a meere deuise and imagination of mans braine.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  The Apostles silence is no sufficient argument against it. For hee renders a reason why hee was inforced to omit diuers deepe points concerning Melchisedec. A high Priest, according to the order of Melchisedec, 
                     Heb. 5. 11. 
                     of whom we haue great speech, and inexplicable to vtter: because you are become weake to heare? 
                     Anglor. in Heb. 5. 11. 
                     Among which no doubt (say the Rhemists) the mysterie of the Sacrament, & Sacrifice of the Altar called Masse was a principall and pertinent matter; And indeede it was not reasonable to talke much to them of that Sacrifice which was the resemblance of Christs death, when they thought not right of Christs death it selfe.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  We doe not ground vpon the silence of the Apostle onely, but of the silence of all the Apostles and Prophets. There is not a word in the whole Bible to declare that Melchisedec was a type of Christ in offering such an vnbloodie Sacrifice in the formes of Bread and Wine, and this very silence is like the voice of a Trumpet proclaiming vnto the world, that Popery is the meer inuention of man, & shall wither in the root from whence it sprung. For euery plant which our heauenly father hath not planted shall be rooted out.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Doe not the Fathers make this a type of the Eucharist? And wherein can it consist, but in an oblation or sacrifice?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  First, some of the Fathers say not that Melchisedec offered this Bread and wine to God but to Abraham. Secondly, those which say it was offered vnto God as a Sacrifice▪ may meane an Eucharisticall Sacrifice, and not a propitiatorie. Thirdly, if any of the Fathers say that hee offered a propitiatorie Sacrifice, yet it followeth not that because they make the oblation of Melchisedec a Type of the Eucharist, that therefore in the Eucharist there is a propitiatorie Sacrifice: for those which hold so, must make a double

oblation of this Bread and Wine, by Melchisedec: the first to God, by way of Sacrifice: the second to Abraham, and the armie in the manner of a banquet: the first might haue relation to Christ vpon the Crosse: the second to the Eucharist. Fourthly, your Popish massing Sacrifice, presupposeth transubstantiation, which is contrary to Christs institutiō of the Eucharist, as in due place shall be declared: Wherefore those fathers which vnderstand the Eucharist, according to Christs institution, cannot referre the type of Melchisedec to any transubstantiate Sacrifice.

                     THe Sacrifice of the Masse, and consequently the office of the Priest or Sacrificer, is proued by an argument drawne from the Paschall Lambe. And first it is cleare by the Scripture, that the Paschal Lambe was a Sacrifice. For we read in Exod 12. 21. 
                     Exodus. Take you for euery of your houshoulds a lambe, and immolate the Passeouer. And againe, Exod. 12. 27. 
                     You shall slay it, it is the Victime or Sacrifice of the Lords Passeouer. And in the 9. of Numbers, 
                     Num. 9. 6. 
                     Certaine men were defiled by a dead man, that they might not keepe the Passeouer the same day, and they came before Moses, and before Aaron the same day. And those men said vnto him, we are defiled by a dead man: Wherfore are we kept back that we may not offer an offring vnto the Lord, in the time therunto appointed? And againe, Ibid. 
                           •
                        . 13. 
                     But the man that is cleane, and is not in a iourney, and is negligent to keepe the Passeouer, the same person shall be cut off from his people, because he brought not the Sacrifice of the Lord in his due season. And in the Gospel of S. Mark. 
                     Mar. 14. 12 
                     The first day of the Azyms, when they sacrificed the Passeouer. And S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 5. 7. 
                     Our Passeouer Christ is immolated.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Admit it were a Sacrifice, what can you conclude?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Ex Bell. de miss. l. 1. cap. 7. 
                     The celebration of the Paschall Lambe was an expresse figure of the celebration of the Eucharist: Therefore if the Paschal Lambe, were a Sacrifice, the Eucharist likewise must be a Sacrifice; that there may be a correspondency betwene the figure, and the thing figured.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  As other ceremonies of the Law, so the Paschall Lambe was most euidently and expresly a figure of Christ, and therefore was fulfilled in the passion of Christ.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     The 
                     Ibidem. 
                     ceremonie of the Paschal Lambe, was more immediately and more principally a figure of the Eucharist, then of the passion, as may appeare by foure circumstances. First, the Paschal Lambe was to be eaten the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, and at the same time Christ instituted the Eucharist: but the passion was deferred vntill the day following.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Because the Eucharist was to succeed the passeouer, therefore the wisedome of God so disposed that it should be instituted at the celebration of the passeouer. But this doth not proue that the Passeouer was more principally a figure of the Eucharist, then of the passion: for what saith the Scripture? Ioh.

                     Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world. How doth he take away the sinnes of the world? Is it not by his death and passion, as it is written, Ephe. 1. 7. 
                     wee haue redemption through his blood, euen the forgiuenes
                     
                     of our sinnes, according to his rich grace: And againe, Reu. 13. 8. 
                     He is the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world, therefore the substance of the Type consisted in this, that hee was slaine, which was not in the Eucharist, but vpon the Crosse. Which is most euidently set downe by the Euangelist Saint Iohn, who rendreth this reason, Ioh. 19. 36. 
                     why his legges were not broken, because it is written, there shall not a bone of him be broken.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Secondly, Bell. ibid deinde. 
                     The Lambe was offered in remembrance of the Lords passing ouer, and the deliuerance of the people: and the Eucharist is celebrated in memory of the Lords passing out of this world to his father, by his passion, and of our deliuerance from the power of Satan, by the death of Christ.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  If both bee memorialls of our deliuerance by Christ, then one is not the body of the other, but the substance of both is Christ.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Thirdly, 
                     Ex Bell. ibid. 
                     the Lambe was offered that it might be eaten, and so is the Eucharist: but Christ was not crucified that he might be eaten, neither was there any then which ate him after hee was so Sacrificed.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  If the Lambe were properly offered, then it was more truely a Type of Christ, then of the Eucharist. For the Scripture witnesseth that Christ was offered vpon the Crosse, but it witnesseth no such thing concerning the Eucharist: onely Christ sayth, Luc. 22. 19. 
                     doe this in remembrance of me. Whereby we learne that the Eucharist is not an oblation but a memoriall of Christs oblation. Now whereas you say that Christ was not crucified that hee might be eaten: Christ himselfe saith, Iohn 6. 53. 
                     Verely, verely, I say vnto you, except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye haue no life in you▪ Whosoeuer eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day. For my flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. And a little before, Iohn 6. 51▪
                      
                     The bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world.
                  
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  That may be meant of his flesh in the Eucharist.
               
               
                  ORTHO.
                  
                     In Ioh. tract. 26. Saint Austin sheweth the contrary in these words. De mensa dominica sumitur, quibusdam ad vitam, quibusdam ad exitium: res verò ipsa cutus sacramentum est, omni homini ad vitam, nulli ad exitium, quicunque eius particeps fuerit. i. Some receiue the sacrament from the Lords Table vnto life, some vnto destruction, but the thing it selfe whose sacrament it is, is to euery one that is partaker therof vnto life, and to none vnto destruction. And so is the flesh here spoken of. 
                        •
                     . Christ crucified, which is meat not for the body, but for the soule, to be eaten, not with the teeth, but with the heart, by a liuely faith both in the Eucharist, and without it.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Ex Bell. ibid. 
                     Fourthly, the Paschall Lambe could not be eaten, sauing onely of the circumcised and cleane, and in Ierusalem: so the Eucharist cannot bee receiued, but onely of the baptised, and cleane, and in the Church: sed etiam alij possunt ac debent Christum vt in cruce immolatum fide manducare. i. But others also may and ought to eat Christ by faith, as he is offered vpon the Crosse.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Can the vncleane eate Christ by faith? This is contrary to the Scripture, which teacheth, Act. 15. 9. 
                     That God by faith doeth purifie the heart. Againe, No vncleane thing shall enter the kingdome of Heauen: but euery beleeuer shall

haue life euerlasting; therefore no sound beleeuer is to be reputed vncleane.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Ex Bell. ibid. illud autem. 
                     Faith goeth before both Baptisme and Iustification; therefore a man may haue faith before he be cleane.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Faith goeth before iustification, onely in the order of nature, and not in the order of time: but it may goe before Baptisme euen in order of time, as the Eunuch beleeued before he was Baptized. But wheresoeuer it is found, or whensoeuer, it purifieth the heart, and maketh the party cleane. Wherefore notwithstanding all these friuolous obiections, it is most sure and certaine, that the Paschall Lambe was most expresly a Type of Christs Passion.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Was it not a Type of the Eucharist also?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Because they were both representations of Christ, therefore there is great similitude and correspondencie betweene them. And because the Passeouer gaue place to the Eucharist, therefore though most properly and principally it was a Type of Christ, yet in this respect it may be called a Type of the Eucharist. But what then? Must it therefore follow, that Christ is properly sacrificed in the Eucharist? God commaunded not onely that the Paschall Lambe should be slaine and immolated, but also that it should be eaten. Now the mactation and immolation was properly fulfilled vpon the Crosse, where Christ our 2. Cor. 5. 7. 
                     Passeouer was sacrificed for vs, and not in the Eucharist; The eating or manducation may be said to be fulfilled in our Spirituall eating of Christ, both in the Sacrament and without.

                     I Wil proue it by other testimonies of the Old Testament; And first by the Prophecie of that man of God that came to Eli, 
                     1. Sam. 2. 35. 
                     I will stirre mee vp a faithfull Priest that shall doe according to my heart, and according to my minde, and hee shall walke before mine Anointed for euer.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  This was fulfilled both in Samuel and Sadock: in Samuel who succeeded Eli; in Sadock who succeeded Abiathar, who was of the race of Eli: For 
                     1 King. 2. 27. 
                     Salomon cast out Abiathar from being Priest vnto the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled which he spake against the house of Eli in Shilo.

                     Ex Bell. de Miss. l. 1. c. 9. De ciuitate Dei. l. 17. c. 3. 
                     S. Austine answereth to this obiection, that this Prophecie was fulfilled in Samuel or Sadock, insomuch as they did cary the figure of Christian Priests. And so the casting out of Eli, was a figure of the casting out of the Aaronicall Priesthood: and the taking in of Samuel and Sadoc, was a figure of the assuming of the Christian Priesthood; Which he proueth, because the Scripture when it saith, that Eli was to bee cast out with his fathers, speaketh plainely of Aaron. For it nameth him, who was appointed of God the first Priest at their departing out of Egypt.

                  Suppose all this were granted: what can you conclude? if the Lord promised, that he will raise himselfe vp a faithfull Priest, and thereby signified a Christian Priest, doeth it therefore follow, that he speaketh of a Popish Priest?
               
               
                  
                  PHIL.
                  That the Lord meant a Priest properly, may appeare by the Prophet Esay, who prophecying of the time of the New Testament, saith, Esay 19. 19. 
                     In that day shall the Altar of the Lord be in the middest of the land of Egypt. And againe, Verse 21. 
                     The Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and doe Sacrifice and oblation. And againe, Esay 61. 6. 
                     Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord, and men shall say vnto you, the Ministers of our God.

                  These may be expounded by other places of the same Prophet, Esay 66. 20. 
                     They shall bring all your brethren, for an offering vnto the Lord Where it is cleare, that the Prophet speaketh of Spirituall offerings, which are offered by the Ministers of the Gospel, As S. Paul 
                     Rom. 15. 16. doeth testifie, That the offering vp of the Gentiles might be acceptable to God, being sanctified by the holy Chost. Which conuersion of the Gentiles, the Prophet describeth by allusion to the Leuiticall sacrifices, Esay 60. 7. 
                     All the sheepe of Kedar shall be gathered vnto thee: the Rammes of Nebaioth shall serue thee: they shall come vp to bee accepted vpon mine Altar: and I will beautifie the house of my Glory. Likewise the Prophet Dauid; 
                     Psal. 51. 19. 
                     Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of Righteousnes, euen the burnt offering and Oblation: then shall they offer calues vpon thine Altar. Where by calues, he vnderstandeth the calues of the lips; that is, the sacrifice of Prayer, and Thankesgiuing. The burnt offering also is to be expounded in the like maner, and therefore he calleth them sacrifices of Righteousnes. And a little before he said, Verse 17. 
                     The sacrifices of God, are a contrite spirit. And as our Spirituall sacrifices are expressed by allusion to the Leuitical: so the Ministers of the Gospel are by like allusion called Priests and Leuites, Esay 66. 21. 
                     I will take of them for Priests and Leuits, saith the Lord. Which cannot be meant of Priests properly, for then the word Leuite should likewise be taken properly; but I hope you will not say that your Masse-priests are properly of the tribe of Leui. By these plaine places we may expound the former by you alleadged.

                  NAy, they are Priests properly in regard of an externall sacrifice2 properly so called, which they offer properly, as is euident by the Prophet Malachie, 
                     Mala. 1. 11. 
                     From the rising vp of the Sunne, to the going downe of the same, my Name is great among the Gentiles, and in euery place incense shalbe offered vp to my Name, and a pure offering, for my Name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of Hosts.

                  The Priests here spoken of, are called the sonnes of Leui: are your Masse-priests properly the sonnes of Leui?

                  The words, sacrifice, oblation, and such like, when they are taken spiritually, are alwaies restrained with some addition: as the sacrifice of praier, of thanksgiuing &c. But here the Prophet saith onely a pure offering without any addition, or limitation. Now

                     the word so taken by it selfe without any restraining tearmes, is alwaies in the Scripture taken properlie for the act of outward sacrifice.

                  That rule is not generally true, for the Prophet Esay

                  Though the word vsed by the Prophet, bee of the singular number, yet by that offering many offerings may bee signified, as when it is said Heb. 10. 8.

                  They might euery where pray and praise God, as well as wee, but this was not a discharge of their dutie, vnlesse to these spirituall sacrifices, they annexed Carnall; to be offered at the time and place appointed; so their spirituall sacrifices were mixed, but ours are merely spirituall, and these are proper to the Gospell.

                  Though the spirituall sacrifices of the Iewes, and of the Christians were all one in substance; yet they differed in manner, because (as I said) theirs were mixtly, ours merely spirituall; and the meerely succeed the mixed.

                  Not so, for they are cleane but vnperfectly; they are cleane because they proceed from the Chrystalline fountaine of the spirit of grace; they are vnperfect, because they are wrought by the will of man, which is regenerate

onely in part, and so the pure Water gathereth mud, because it runneth through a muddie channel.

                     light which shineth more & more vnto the perfect day: & though the flesh rebelleth against the spirit, yet at length the spirit shall haue the victory, and the flesh shalbe abolished. In the meane time though our good workes be stained with the flesh, yet God looketh not vpon them as an angry Iudge, but as a louing Father crowning his owne graces in vs, and pardoning our offences. Now because they are imperfect, they cannot iustifie, merit, nor satisfie, yet because they are Gods graces, they are the pure offering in Malachi.

                     For in this place by adoration is not meant euery adoration, but solemne and publike, which is by sacrifice properly so called, which may bee proued because the Samaritane speaketh of adoration tyed to a certaine place; Ioh. 4. 20. 
                     Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine, and yee say that in Ierusalem is the place where men ought to worship, which cannot bee meant but onely of adoration by sacrifice, and therefore if Christ answere the point, he must likewise speake of adoration by sacrifice.

                     THE words of institution yeelde inuincible proofe, that Christ at his last Supper sacrificed his very body and bloud vnder the formes of bread and wine, to God the Father, and commanded his Apostles and their successours to doe the same vnto the end of the world.
               
               
                  ORTHO.
                  First you must proue that the very body and blood of Christ were vnder the formes of bread and wine, or else you will come short of your sacrifice.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  That is plaine by the words of Christ: This is my body; This is my blood. For he spake of those things which he had in his hands, and hee calleth them his body & blood, but to outward appearance there was only bread and wine: therefore seeing the words of our Sauiour must needs be true, it followeth, that the very body and blood of Christ were vnder the appearance of bread and wine.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The words of our Sauiour are most true, in that sense wherein he ment them: But it was his will that they should be taken Sacramentally, and not Substantially; which will appeare if Scripture be expounded by Scripture, and Sacraments by Sacraments. To beginne with Circumcision, the Lord said: Genes. 17. 10 
                     This is my Couenant which you shall keepe betweene me and you, and thy seed after thee: let euery man child be circumcised: hoc est foedus meum, this thing is my Couenant: what thing? that euery man child be circumcised: therefore Circumcision is called the Couenant. But is it the couenant properly? it is impossible; therefore it is improperly and figuratiuely: for so God himselfe expounds it. Vers. 11. 
                     You shall circumcise the foreskin of your flesh, and it shalbe a signe of the Couenant betweene me and you. Therefore Circumcision is called the Couenant, because it is a signe of the Couenant. But is it a bare and naked signe? not so, for the Apostle saith, Rom. 4. 11. 
                     he receiued the signe of Circumcision as the seale of righteousnesse of the faith which he had when he was yet vncircumcised: so circumcision was not onely a signe to signifie, but also a seale to confirme vnto him the righteousnesse of faith, that is, the righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith, and imputed to all that beleeue. Neither was this seale onely promissory, but also exhibitory, deliuering vnto them Christ Iesus with all his blessings. From Circumcision let vs come to the Passeouer: Exod. 12. 11. 
                     You shall eat it in hast, for it is the Lords Passeouer. what shall they eat? was it not a Lambe? there a Lambe is the Lords Passeouer. But why is it so called? The Lord himselfe expoundeth it, saying, Vers. 13. 
                     the blood shall be a token for you: so the Lambe is called a Passeouer, because it was a token, that is, a signe and a seale of the Lords passing ouer them. From the ordinary Sacraments of the Old Testament, let vs come to the extraordinary. Saint Paul speaking of the Rocke, saith, 1. Cor. 10.

                     Austine saith: the Apostle saith not we signifie the buriall, but he saith flatly wee are buried together with him: so hee called the Sacrament of so great a thing, no otherwise then by the name of the thing it selfe. To which agreeth your owne Iesuite; Tollet. in Rom. c. 6. 
                     Baptizati vna cum Christo sepeliuntur, idest, Christi sepulturam representant. That is, those that are baptized are buried together with Christ, that is, they represent the buriall of Christ From Baptisme let vs come to the Lords Supper, which consisteth of two courses; the Bread representing his Body, and the Wine representing his Blood, the former may be expounded by the latter. For Christ calleth Luk. 20. 22. 
                     This Cup The new Testament, because it is a signe and seale of the new Testament. Therefore when it is said this is my Body, and this is my Blood: the wordes must likewise bee taken, figuratiuely; and sacramentally; as though it were said: this Bread and this Wine, is a signe and a seale of my Body and Blood. Yea these very wordes, this is my Body, may bee expounded by the like wordes, signifying the same thing: 1. Cor. 10. 16. 
                     the Bread that wee breake is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? which word Communion must of necessitie bee taken figuratiuely, and sacramentally, for a signe and seale of this Communion. The Apostles were well acquainted with this figure and vsed it themselues before the institution of the Sacrament; for they saide vnto Iesus, Mat. 26. 17. 
                     where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eate the Passeouer? by Passeouer meaning the Paschall Lambe, which was a signe and memoriall of the Passeouer. Thus the whole course of Scripture proclaimeth, that these words this is my body, must not bee expounded Substantially, but Sacramentally. So the meaning is: this is my body, that is, this Bread is a Signe, Seale, and Sacrament of my Body.

First, hee tooke; what tooke hee? hee tooke Bread, materiall Bread, such as was vpon the Table. After hee had taken, hee blessed; what did he blesse? be blessed that which hee tooke; but that was materiall Bread, therefore hee blessed the materiall Bread. After hee had blessed, hee brake and gaue; what did hee breake and giue? the same which hee had blessed, therefore as he blessed the materiall Bread, so hee brake and gaue the materiall Bread; when hee gaue he saide, take and eate: what should they take and eate but that which he gaue? therefore seeing hee gaue materiall Bread, hee commanded them likewise to take and to eate the materiall Bread. When hee had saide take and eate, hee added imediately, this is my Body. This? what this? this that hee had taken, this that he had blessed, this that hee had broken? this that hee gaue them, this that hee commanded them to take and eate. This, and nothing but this, hee calleth his Body. But this was materiall Bread, as hath beene proued, and therefore when he said this is my Body, the Pronoune (this) did demonstrate the materiall Bread.

                  As the Paschall Lambe was changed, when of a common

Lambe, it was made a Type of the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world: or as the water of Baptisme is changed, when of common water, it is made a holy representation of the blood of Christ: So the Bread and Wine are changed in the Lords Supper, that is, in vse, not in substance, for before they bee brought to the Lords Table, they are common Bread and common Wine, for the feeding of the body, but when they are sanctified according to Christs institution, then the God of heauen setteth another stampe vpon them, and maketh them a Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: yet as the lambe still remained a lambe in substance: as the water euen in the action of Baptizing, still remaineth water in substance: so the Bread and Wine still retaine their former substance, euen after the blessing. For Christ did breake the Bread after he had blessed it, yet still it was Bread, as the Apostle witnesseth, saying, the 
                     1. Cor. 10. 16. 
                     Bread that we breake. Yea the Communicants doe eate it after it is broken, and still it is Bread, euen in the mouthes of the Communicants, For S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 11. 28. 
                     Let a man examine himselfe and so let him eate of this Bread. Neither is it called Bread, because it was bread, but because it is Bread, not in name onely, but in nature and properties. For after Consecration it nourisheth the body as before, it is subiect to fall vpon the ground, to bee eaten of Mice, to bee deuoured of Beastes, to bee burned in the fire, to bee turned to ashes, and to suffer putrifaction: which cannot be affirmed of the body of Christ, because Psal. 16. 10. Act. 2. 27. 
                     that holy one shall not see corruption: so the wine after Consecration, doth not onely nourish and comfort the heart, but if the Priest drinke too much of it, it will intoxicate his braine, yea and if it bee kept too long, it will bee turned to vinegar, and putrifie. All which things doe argue, that the elements doe still retaine the true nature and substance of Bread and Wine, and are not changed into the body and blood of Christ, in corporall manner by vertue of the blessing. But that wee may vnderstand this the better, I pray you, tell me what is meant by the blessing.

                  The Scripture expounds blessing by thankesgiuing. For Saint Mat. 26. 26. 
                     Matthew, Saint Luk. 22. 19 
                     Luke and Saint 1. Cor. 11. 24. 
                     Paul say, that when Christ had giuen thankes hee brake the bread, Saint Mar. 14. 22. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     Marke saith, that when he had blessed, hee brake it. So Matthew, Marke, Luke and Paul, say that when Christ had giuen thankes, he gaue the Cuppe, and mention not the blessing of it: Yet Saint 1. Cor. 10. 16. 
                     Paul elsewhere calleth it the Cuppe of blessing. Likewise whereas Saint Luk. 12. 16. 
                     Luke saith, that Christ tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen, and blessed them: Saint Ioh. 6. 11. 
                     Iohn saith, that Iesus tooke the bread, and gaue thankes; whereby it is euident, that the holy Ghost vseth the word blessing, and thankesgiuing indifferently. But withall we must obserue that vnder the word thankesgiuing, is comprehended prayer. As when the 1. Tim. 4. 5. Apostle teacheth vs to receiue the creature with thankesgiuing, he renders this reason, because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. Where it is plaine that thankesgiuing in the former place, comprehendeth prayer, and the word Prayer vsed in the latter place, comprehendeth thankesgiuing: as though the Apostle

should haue said; we on our part must receiue the creature with prayer and thankesgiuing, because it is sanctified as on Gods part, by his word and ordinance, so on our part, by prayer and thankesgiuing. Secondly, we must obserue that the creature may be sanctified to a double vse: That is, either corporall or spirituall, and to both by prayer, and thankesgiuing. Thirdly, that the sanctifying of a creature is in the Scripture called blessing, as when it is said, the Lord blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it. Now our Lord Iesus intending to institute a Sacrament, tooke the bread and gaue thankes, not only for the bread, but especially for the redemption of the Church, and praied that these elements of Bread and Wine, might be euerlastingly sanctified to Sacramentall vse, thus the Bread and Wine were blessed. And whereas you with Bell. de Sacr. Euchar. l. 4. c. 13 
                     Bellarmine and others say, that this blessing was performed by these wordes, this is my Body, it cannot bee; For the blessing was finished, before those words were vttered. Saint Marke saith, that Mark. 14. 22. 
                     when he had blessed the Bread, hee brake it, by which it is euident that the blessing was accomplished before the bread was broken, & it is manifest that he brake it before he gaue it, therefore the blessing was finished before the Bread was giuen. But he gaue it, saying, take eate, this is my body, therefore the blessing was finished before he said, this is my body. Now how is it possible that he should blesse by those wordes seeing the blessing was fully ended before those words were begunne? Wherefore Cardinall In Mat. c. 26 
                     Caietan doth rightly call it, benedictionem laudis, non Consecrationis. i. the blessing of praise, and not of Consecration. But if we should imagine, that he blessed by saying, this is my body, would not this imagination inuert the order of the actions of Christ?

                  THere are many Hysterologies in holy Scripture, and therefore5 no maruell if there be one here. Now the words and actions of Christ, reduced to their naturall Methode, are thus to be ordered. Durantus de rit. Eccle. Cath. l. 2. c. 38. n. 19.

                     non consequenter sed concomitanter: meaning that he blessed by these wordes, this is my body, yet so, that the wordes were in pronouncing all the while that he brake and gaue the Bread. But this vanisheth of it selfe, because, as hath beene proued out of the text, the blessing was finished, before the wordes were begunne. Cardinall 
                     Bessar. de Euchar. 
                     Bessarion ordereth them thus: hee tooke the bread, and when he had blessed, saying, take eate, this is my body, he brake it and gaue it. But this may also be confuted by the same reason: and moreouer it containeth an absurditie; for so he should bid them take it before hee gaue it. And thirdly, if hee blessed, saying, take eate, this is my body, then take and eate, are wordes of blessing as well as this is my body. Now you with Durantus order them thus: he tooke the bread, and when he had blessed, saying, this is my body: he brake it, and gaue it, and saide, take and eate: but this is also confuted by the same argument drawne from the blessing. Secondly, the word (saying) which is but once in the Text, by ordering them thus, is vsed twice. Thirdly, the words, Take, eate, which Christ vsed first, are put last. Fourthly, whereas Christ spake all in one continuall sentence, the sentence is dismembred, and torne into two. These inconueniences, your owne Doctors Sotus and Caietanus did

But let vs feigne that the words and actions are to be ordered, as you would haue them: yet notwithstanding, by the word hoc, must needs be meant the Bread: for if he tooke the bread and blessed it, saying, Thus is my body, what can be meant by the Pronoune thus, but onely this bread?

                  If you take it so, you make an absurd Proposition: For a 
                     Bell. ibid. 
                     thing that is seene and openly knowne, cannot be termed this thing, vnlesse that thing be of the Neuter gender: for no man when hee demonstrateth his brother, will say, this thing is my brother, or demonstrating the Image of Caesar, will say, This thing is Caesar: therefore neither could it be rightly said of the Bread, which the disciples did see, This thing is my body. The reason is, because the subiectum of the Proposition should be better knowne then the praedicatum, therefore when the subiectum is knowne to the hearers in particular, it ought not to bee vttered by a name that is generall, but then onely it ought to be vttered by a name that is generall, when it is not knowne, but onely in generall. As for example; Certaine men see a thing afarre of, but yet they discerne not what it is, whether a tree, a stone, or a man, but I see that it is a man; Wherefore I will say to the rest, that thing is a man, and not he is a man; But if they see him to be a man, yet doe not discerne who it is, Peter or Paul, or some other, I will not say, that thing is Peter, because they know it already to be a man; But I will say he is Peter. Therefore seeing the disciples did see the Bread, and were not ignorant that it was Bread, it had bene a most absurd speech, if of that Bread the Lord had said, This thing is my body, when he should haue said, This Bread is my body: therefore it cannot bee that the word hoc, should demonstrate the Bread as the subiect of the Proposition.

                  A thing that is seene and openly knowne, may be expressed by a Pronoune of the Neuter gender, without absurditie, although the thing it selfe bee not of the Neuter gender. As for example; When the Lord brought the woman vnto the man, he said, Gene. 2. 22. 
                     Hoc nunc est os ex ossibus meis, i. Now this is bone of my bones. For what thinke you is meant by hoc?

Now, where S. Luke saith, This Chalice is the New Testament in my Blood, S. Matthew, and S. Marke haue, This is my Blood, vnderstanding by the Pronoune this, the same thing that S.

                  It pleaseth the spirit of God in the Greeke Testament, sometimes to depart from that phrase and Analogie of speech, which is vsual in other Greeke Authors, either to expresse some Hebraisme, or for some other reason best knowne to his heauenly wisdome: therefore though a participle with an article praepositiue, should regularly be gouerned of somewhat going before of the same case number and gender: yet there are sundry examples in Scripture where it is otherwise, the Article supplying the place of a relatiue: as for example,Reuel. 1. 4. 5.

                      standeth for a relatiue as though it were said in Latin, ab eo qui venturus, the like is to bee said of

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . By which it is euident, that the spirit of God departeth from the Analogie of the Greeke tongue, and vseth sometimes the Article for a relatiue, and so it may be vsed in this place,

                     ▪ yet in the New Testament there is no such necessitie. Wherefore seeing according to the speech of the holy Ghost, the words stand indifferently to bee referred to both constructions, let vs now consider the thing it selfe, that so wee may finde the true construction of the words. The holy Ghost in these words of Saint Luke declareth, what Christ said when hee deliuered the cuppe: the same thing is expressed both in Saint Matthew and Saint Marke, and both of them vse the same participle 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and referre it cleerely and emdently to blood, both in the Greeke and your vulgar Latin, and not vnto the Cuppe. Whereby wee are taught that though in Saint Luke the construction stand indifferently betweene the blood and the cuppe, yet by conference of Scripture, it is restrained vnto the blood, and not vnto the cup: so the sence of the place is, this cup, (that is the wine in this cup) is the New Testament, that is (a signe and seale of the New Testament) in my blood, which blood is shed for you. And that it must needs bee meant of the cuppe of wine, may appeare by Saint Matthew, saying, And when he had taken the cup and giuen thankes, he gaue it them saying, Drink yee all of this. For by your owne confession before the words of Consecration it was wine, but Christ said this before the wordes of Consecration, and therefore hee spake of wine: but hee addeth immediately, for this (which I giue you to drinke) is my blood: therefore hee calleth the wine his blood; so the pronoune (this) demonstrateth the wine. For how can it be otherwise? You confesse that it was wine, till the words of Consecration were ended: but when hee said (this) the words were not ended: and therefore then, according to your owne principles it was wine, which is agreeable to the Fathers.

Therefore beeing in a quandary; what to say, hee thought hee would speake safely, though thereby hee shewed himselfe but slenderly resolued.

                     Cum scriptura duarum tantum substantiarum quae demonstrari hic queant, meminerit, viz. panis & Corporis, nescio cur fingant tertiam aliquam, quae nec panis sit nec Corpus, quae tamen per pronomen demonstretur, in quo magnam Scripturae vim faciunt, infarcientes illi ex suo cerebro tertiam istam rem cuius nullam habet mentionem, & quâ positâ, propositio falsa esset: si autem nullam tertiam rem ponere se dicunt, quae sit alia a Christi Corpore, cur tot verba effutiunt ad docendum quod Corpus non demonstretur? cur nudam nobis rem non proponunt? cur tot illam verborum inuolucris contegunt? in Dei verbo duarum tantum Substantiarum mentio habetur, & reuera nulla substantia fuit in Christi manibus post acceptum panem, praeter panem & Corpus, quae per pronomen demonstrari possit, & tamen solam illam substantiam singularem demonstrabat, quae erat in suis manibus sub speciebus panis. Tertiam ergo quaerere a pane & Corpore discretam, vanissimus labor est & absurditate plenus. i. VVhen the Scripture maketh mention onely of two substances which can here bee demonstrated, that is of the Bread and the body, I knowe not why they should faigne any third, which is neither Bread nor Body, and yet is demonstrated by the pronoune; Wherein they offer great violence to the Scripture, stuffing into it out of their owne braine this third thing whereof they haue no mention, which being granted, the proposition should bee false. But if they say they put no third thing which is diuerse from the Body of Christ, why doe they spend so many wordes to teach that the Body is not demonstrated? Why doe they not propose to vs the naked matter? why doe they hide it with so many folds of wordes? In the word of God there is onely mention of two Substances, and verely there was no substance in Christes handes beside Bread and his Body which can possibly bee demonstrated by the Pronoune, and yet hee did demonstrate onely that singular substance which was in his hands vnder the formes of Bread: therefore to seeke a third distinct from the Bread and the Body is a labour most vaine and full of absurditie. For what shall this third thing bee? you say

it is Bel. de sacram. euchar. c. 10. 
                     that which is contained vnder the shapes of Bread and Wine, but what is that? your owne Quo supra. Archbishop saith, quic quid dixerint, semper eo cogendi sunt vt dicant an Corpus an panis ostendatur in singulari, quia pronomen vice nominis proprij positum pro solo singulari sumipossit, That is, what soeuer they shall say, they are still to bee vrged to this issue that they tell vs whether the Body or Bread bee demonstrated in particular, because a pronoune put in place of a proper noune, must needes bee taken for a particular or singular. One of these two it must needes bee, vnlesse you will speake vainely and absurdly. Now the Body of Christ it cannot bee, for then it should bee there before Consecration, and without Consecration; and consequently it should bee the Body of Christ, before it were the body; and there should be blood in the Chalice before Cōsecration, & without Consecration; and consequently it should bee blood before it were blood, and blood without blood: which are intollerable absurdities. Thus you haue forsaken the fountaine of liuing water, & digged vnto your selues broken ceasterns which will hold no water. You haue left the Scripture and the Fathers, you wander in the wildernesse of your owne conceites, and loose your selues in the laberynth of your owne imaginations. How much better were it to confesse the truth with the Scripture and the Fathers, and giue the glory to God? your owne Cardinall Petrus de Aliaco in 4. s. q. 6. art. 2. 
                     Petrus de Aliaco did see euen in the darkenesse of Popery, that the Bread remained after Consecration; Patet quod iste modus est possibilis nec repugnat rationi nec authoritati biblicae, imo est facilior ad intelligendum & rationabilior. i. It is apparent that this maner is possible, neither is it repugnant to reason, nor to the authoritie of the Bible, yea it is more easie to vnderstand, and more reasonable. Now the Bread in substance cannot bee the Body of Christ in substance, but in signification. And consequently, the proposition cannot bee vnderstood substantially, but sacramentally.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Christ did not say, this signifieth my Body, or this is a Sacrament of my Body, or this is my Body sacramentally, but hee said absolutely, this is my Body.

                  Hee spake the wordes of wisedome, and that in the most excellent manner, for which manner of speech two reasons may bee rendered. The first because hee was desirous to speake most emphatically: when wee see a childe like vnto his father, wee vse to say this childe hath his fathers face, and yet wee meane onely that hee is very like vnto his father, yet wee say not hee is like vnto his father, but hee hath his fathers face, to expresse a most wonderfull similitude in a most emphaticall manner. So if one should haue seene the image of Alexander made by Phidias, hee might haue saide this is Alexander himselfe, not meaning that his wordes should bee taken properly, but to expresse the similitude most emphatically. Euen so our Lord Iesus willing to expresse in how liuely manner the Bread and Wine doe represent his Body and Blood, doth not say that they signifie his Body and Blood, or that they are signes and Sacraments of his Body and Blood, but speaking most significantly hee saith this (Bread) is my Body, this (Wine) is my Blood. Another reason is because our sweete Sauiour would seale all his comfortable blessings vnto the soule of the worthie receiuer, as if a King bestowing a Castle vpon one of his subiects, and reaching vnto him the sealed writing containing the graunt, should say vnto

him, behold here, take what I giue thee, it is such a Castle. For though hee might haue said, this writing doth signifie the gift of such a Castle, yet it is more significant and more comfortable to say, it is such a Castle. For so the king doth cheere vp his heart, and by that writing doth put him into actuall possession of the Castle. Euen so our Lord Iesus, though he might haue said, this is a sacrament of my body, yet to giue vs more cordiall comfort, he saith, this is my body, assuring vs thereby, that in giuing vs that Bread, hee giueth vs himselfe, and putteth vs in actuall possession of his graces and blessings, purchased vnto vs by his body and blood.

                     Bellarmine may teach you, who declareth out of the writings of Luther, that the words of the Euangelist, this is my body, according to Luther, do cary this sence, this bread is my body. Which sentence, saith Bellarmine, must eyther be taken tropically, that the bread may be the body of Christ, by way of signification, or it is plainely absurde and impossible. For it cannot be, that bread should be the body of Christ (properly:) wherefore the schollers of Luther, had rather runne backe to a trope, then admit a manifest absurditie. Here is a cleere confession that if by (this) be meant this bread, then the proposition must needs be taken tropically, that is, as we take it, or otherwise, it is absurde and impossible. But it were blasphemy to say that Christ spake absurdities, and impossibilities, therfore if the pronoune (this) doe demonstrate the bread, the proposition must needes carry that sence which we make of it, and then the Protestants haue gotten the victory by the confession of your most learned Cardinall. For great is the trueth and preuaileth. So your carnall presence, and consequently both your sacrifice and Priesthood doe fall to the ground.
                  ANd if for disputations sake wee should faine, (though indeed it bee a11. meere fiction) that the body of Christ were corporally and carnally in the Sacrament, yet for all this, you are neuer able to proue your Sacrifice, vpon which your Priesthood dependeth, because the Scripture acknowledgeth no other, then that vpon the Crosse. For Heb. 9. 12. neither by the blood of goates, and calues, but by his owne blood, (which the Scripture elsewhere calleth the Col. 1. 20. blood of the Crosse) entred he in once into the holy place and obtained eternall redemption for vs. 
                     Ver. 9. 24. 
                     Hee is entred into the very heauen, to appeare now in the sight of God for vs, Not that he should offer himselfe often as the high Priest entred into the holy place, euery yeare with other blood, (for then must hee haue often suffered since the foundation of the world) but now in the end of the world, he hath appeared once, to put away sinne by the Sacrifice of himselfe. 
                     Ver. 27. 28. 
                     And as it is appointed vnto men that they shall once die, and after that commeth the iudgement, so Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many, and vnto them that looke for him, shall he appeare the second time without sinne vnto saluation. 
                     Heb. 10. 12. 
                     This man after he had offered one Sacrifice for sinnes, sitteth for euer at the right hand of God, and from henceforth tarieth till his enemies be made his footestoole. For with one offering hath he Consecrated for euer them that are sanctified. If Christ haue shed, offered, and sacrificed his blood not often but once, and that vpon the Crosse, then can it not bee really shed, offered, and sacrificed in the Eucharist. If by one oblation, he hath obtained an eternall redemption, put away sinne, and Consecrated for euer those that

are sanctified; then your sacrificing of him is vaine and vnprofitable, contrary to the Scripture, and iniurious to the all-sufficient sacrifice of Iesus Christ.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  He was sacrificed once, and not often, in that manner as he was vpon the Crosse; yet hee was sacrificed in the Eucharist also, as I will prooue both by the words of Christ, and by his actions. First, by his wordes, for hee said, this is my body which is giuen for you: or as it is in Saint Paul, which is broken for you: And againe, this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you. 
                     Ex Bell. l. 1. de Missa. c. 12. preter illa. 
                     Is shed, is broken is giuen, not to you, but to God for you. Doe not these words argue a reall, actuall, and proper sacrifice?

                  You must consider that it is not said, which shall bee giuen, shall bee broken, shall be shed, but which is giuen, is broken, is shed, which argues that the place is not to be expounded of the sacrifice of the Crosse, that was to come, but of a sacrifice in the Eucharist, which was present.

                  The present tense, is vsed for the future, funditur for fundetur: for proofe wherof, I wil produce two witnesses, which with you are most authentical, the vulgar translation, and the Canon of the Masse, in both which it is not funditur, is shed, but fundetur shall be shed. Whereby you may learneb Missale Romanum. that the present tense vsed in the Greeke, is to be expounded by the future vsed in the Latin, and consequently it is to bee vnderstood of the sacrifice of the Crosse, which was to come.

                     Both are true, and neither of the readings ought to be denyed, and especially that of the present tense, because the Euangelists and S. Paul, did write in the present tense.

                     Ex ore tuo serue nequam: Is funditur in the present tense, lesse to be denyed, because the Euangelists, and S. Paul did write in the present tense? is it so indeede, albeit the Canon of the Masse, and your vulgar translation which may not be reiected vnder any pretence, haue fundetur in the future tense? then it seemeth that the blessed originalls are to be preferred before a translation, whatsoeuer the Counsell of Trent haue said to the contrary. O the force of trueth, which breaketh out like lightning, and shineth in darkenesse, though the darkenes comprehendeth it not! but this by the way. Now for the present point, though the vulgar hath not expressed the letter of the text, yet it hath wel expressed the sence. For Cardinal Caietan 1. Cor. 11. 
                     Caietan confesseth that the Euangelists did vse the present tense, in saying the blood is shed: and S. Paul in saying, the body is broken, and signified the future shedding and breaking vpon the Crosse: and the Iesuite Salmeron in 1. Cor. 11. disp. 19. p. 154. 
                     Salmeron saith, Non est negandum morem esse Scripturae, vt ea dicantur fieri de praesenti, quae confestim esse aut mox fieri debent: that is, it is not to be denied, that it is the maner of the Scripture, that those things should be said to be presently done, which ought to be immediatly, or to be done by and by. Yea Cardinall Caiet. ibid. 
                     Caietan goeth further, and saith, Tempus effus
                           •
                        onis & fractionis erat tum presens, quoniam inchoatum erat tempus passionis: that is, the time of shedding and breaking was then present, because the time of his Passion was begunne. Thus you see that this shedding and breaking which the Spirit of God expressed in the present tense, may aptly be expounded of the sacrifice of the Crosse, and that according to the custome of the Scripture, euen in the iudgement of your owne

men. Therefore you cannot hence conclude any sacrifice in the Eucharist.

                  YEs, it may be proued by the words of Christ, as they are related by12. 
                     S. Paul, This is my body which is broken for you. For seeing the Euangelists doe say, (Giuen for you,) meaning to God as a sacrifice: therefore this breaking also must be expounded of a sacrifice. Now, breaking agreeth not to the Body of Christ, but onely as it is in the forme of bread: therefore S. Paul speaketh of Christ, as he was sacrificed in the Eucharist vnder the forme of bread.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The word breaking may properly be applied to Christ vpon the Crosse. For the Prophet Esay speaking of the Passion, saith, Esay 53. 5. 
                     He was broken for our iniquitie. And againe, Verse 1

                     The Lord would breake him, and make him subiect to infirmities; And though it be most true, that there was not a bone of him broken, yet when he was nailed vpon the Crosse, his skinne, his flesh, his sinewes, his vaines were properly broken. Therefore this doeth not euince any sacrifice in the Eucharist, but onely vpon the Crosse.

                     The sacrifice of the Masse is offered in the person of Christ: But the Priest performeth nothing so euidently in the person of Christ, as Consecration, in which he saith, This is my Body: Therefore the sacrifice consisteth in Consecration, as in an essentiall part thereof.

                     Bellarmine himselfe, when hee went disguised in the habit of Tortus, affirmed, That the words of Consecration doe not concurre formally, but efficiently to the oblation.

                  Yes, his Oblation vpon the Crosse was a proper Propitiatorie sacrifice: but in the Eucharist there is no such sacrifice at all.

                     If the Apostles in the beginning added nothing to the words of Consecration, but the Lords Prayer, then it must needs be they did sacrifice by Consecrating: for the Lords Prayer cannot be called a sacrifice.

                     Ibid quarto. 
                     The representation of the sacrifice of the Crosse, consisteth in Consecration, as S. Thomas teacheth, but the Reall and representatiue should be both together.

                  And why so? The representatiue was in the Sacrament, the Reall vpon the Crosse. In the first institution the representatiue was before the Reall: In all other celebrations of it, the Reall is before the representatiue. Neither can you conclude that there is a Reall sacrifice properly in the Sacrament, because there is a representatiue.

That is, There is a question, whether that which the Priest doeth, bee properly called a sacrifice or an immolation; And whether Christ be dayly offered, or were offered onely once. To this may be briefly said, That that which is offered and Consecrated by the Priest is called a sacrifice and oblation, because it is a memoriall and representation of the true sacrifice, and holy oblation made vpon the altar of the Crosse. And Christ dyed once vpon the Crosse, and there was offered in himselfe, and he is daily offered in the sacrament, because in the sacrament there is a memoriall made of that which was done once.

                  Then let vs consider whether these three things bee found in the Eucharist, and first it is euident, that Bread and Wine of common are made holy, euen the body and blood of Christ Sacramentally: but if Bread and Wine be the sacrifice, then earthly elements are offered for the redemption of the Church, which once to imagine were horrible impiety.

                     That which of common is so made holy, that it remaineth, (and that onely) without doubt is properly sacrificed; but the substance of the Bread and Wine doe not remaine, and therefore they are not the sacrifice.

                  That they doe remaine, hath beene alreadie proued, and therefore if that be the sacrifice which of common is so made holy, that it remaineth, then a piece of bread shalbe the sacrifice for the sinnes of the world. But if we should faigne that the substance of the elements were taken away, and that the body and blood of Christ were corporally and carnally vnder the formes of Bread and Wine, yet you could not proue your sacrifice, for where doe you find the second point, that is, oblation?

For to lay the sacrifice vpon the Altar, is in very deed to offer it vnto God; and because it commeth to passe by the force of Consecration, that the bodie and blood of Christ beginne to bee reallie vpon the Altar, by the meanes of the Priests hand, therefore a true and solemne oblation is celebrated by the words of Consecration.

                  First, if by the words of Consecration the body and blood of Christ, beginne to bee really vpon the Altar, then it is by meanes of the Priests tongue, and not of the Priests hand. Secondly, it is one thing to lay the sacrifice vpon the Altar, and an other thing really to offer it, as may appeare by the wordes of the Scripture, Gen. 2

                     And when they came to the place which God had shewed him, Abraham builded an Altar there, and couched the wood, and bound Izhak his sonne, and laied him on the Altar vpon the wood: Here the sacrifice was really laide vpon the Altar, but it cannot bee said that hee was really sacrificed or offered for a burnt offering, but onely in Abrahams intention, and Gods acceptation. Thirdly, if the sacrifice bee the body and blood, then seeing by your owne doctrine the bodie and bloud are not vpon the Altar, til the words of Consecration be finished, it followeth, that there is no sacrifice till the Consecration be finished, and consequently there is no oblation of the sacrifice begunne before the Consecration bee finished. Now if the oblation beginne after the Consecration is ended, then is it not celebrated by the wordes of Consecration, vnlesse you will say that an oblation may bee celebrated before it bee, and that a thing is ended before it beginne. But let vs faigne, that the body and blood of Christ, were properly offered to God by the words of Consecration, yet you cannot thence conclude a sacrifice. For you required a third condition in a sacrifice, that is, the destruction of the thing sacrificed.

                  Then it will follow from your owne positions, that if Christ bee aliue in the Eucharist, either the Priest doth not Sacrifice him, or else he killeth him before hee sacrifice him, and consequently either there are no sacrifising Priests in the New Testament, except Christ onely, or if there bee any, they are all murtherers and killers of Christ. If you say that Christ is in the Eucharist, and yet not aliue, how can this bee? Is not Christ in the Eucharist now, as hee was at the first institution? When Christ said, this is my bodie, his bodie was then aliue, and now also is liuing in Heauen.

                     For the holie one shall not see corruption, and if it bee not destroyed, then you confesse that it is no Sacrifice: so euery way you are intangled.

But to proceede, how can the body of Christ bee consumed with eating? if it cannot, then by your confession there is no Sacrifice.

                  The destruction required in a sacrifice must bee reall, for it must cease really to bee that which it was; as for example the lambes which were daily offered, first they were slaine, and so ceased formally to be lambes; then the flesh was burned, so it ceased materially to bee flesh; and when any part of the sacrifice was eaten, and by eating turned into the substance of man, then it ceased to bee that flesh, which it was before. Now if in the Eucharist the body of Christ bee not really consumed, then according to your positions it is not really sacrified; and yet for mine owne part I doe not see, but that it followeth according to your principles, that the very naturall essence and being of Christ is properly destroyed: which is horrible blasphemie.

                  If you doubt of it, it may be prooued by experience, for there is no question but the Priest or any man else may liue a long time, though he haue no other sustenance but such Bread and Wine. And therefore it is certaine that it nourisheth. But nourishment is, when the substance of the meate is changed into the substance of the nourished; & therefore if the consecrated elements doe nourish, they must needes haue a substance which must bee changed into the substance of the nourished. What substance is this? Bread you say it is not; for that is vanished by Consecration. And therefore it can bee nothing but the Body and Blood of Christ; whereupon it wil follow, that the naturall Body and Blood of Christ are substantially changed into the substance of the nourished, be it man, bird, or beast, which is out ragious blasphemie. And if it bee so changed, then it hath lost the naturall being and essence

which it had before, and consequently the Body and Blood of Christ is substantially consumed and destroyed. If you bee ashamed of this, then bee ashamed of the fountaine from whence it floweth.

For are not all miracles immediately from God? therefore if your answere be true, God should prouide miracles for fatting of mice, and concurre with a miracle to make the Priest druncke.

                     Flee from the seruing of idoles, I speake as to wise men. Your selues iudge what I say, the chalice of benediction, which we doe blesse, is it not the Communication of the blood of Christ? and the bread which we breake, is it not the participation of the body of our Lord? For being many, wee are one bread, one body, all that participate of one bread. Behold Israel according to the flesh: they that eate the hostes, are they not partakers of the Altar? what then? doe I say that that which is immolated vnto idoles, is any thing? or that the idol is any thing? But the things that the heathen doe immolate, to diuels they do immolate, and not to God. And I will not haue you become fellows of the diuels. You cannot drinke the chalice of our Lord, and the chalice of diuels: you cannot be partakers of the Table of our Lord, and of the Table of diuels. 
                     Ex Bell. de Miss. l. 1. c. 14. ex his verbis. 
                     Out of these words, are gathered three arguments, the first from the comparison of the Lords Table, with the altar of the Gentiles, where they offered to idoles, and with the altar of the Iewes, where they offered carnall sacrifice to the true God. For thence it followeth that the Lords Table is a kind of altar; now an altar is erected to sacrifice, and there is no sacrifice without a Priest. The like reason may be drawne from the comparison of the Eucharist, with their sacrifice, and from the partaking the one and the other.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The point of the comparison consisteth in this, that as those which receiue the Sacraments of Christians, doe therein declare themselues to be partakers of the Christian religion: so those which vse the sacrifices and ceremonies of Iewes or Gentiles, doe thereby signifie that they are partakers of their religion; and thereupon the Apostle exhorteth them to refraine from the tables and feasts of idoles, least thereby they should haue fellowshipwith the diuels. Therefore you cannot conclude hence either sacrifice or altar.

                  They doe so, but not such as you meane. For the oblation & sacrifice which they defend in the Eucharist, is not properly propitiatory, nor properly a sacrifice, but only a commemoration, and a representation of the soueraigne sacrifice.

                     If the Fathers had meant so, then there was no cause why they should speake otherwise of the Eucharist, then of Baptisme. But they neuer called Baptisme a sacrifice, or said, that to Baptise, is to sacrifice. Therefore, it is a signe that when they often call the Eucharist a sacrifice, they name it so properly.

                  Doe the Fathers neuer call Baptisme a sacrifice? Your learned Bishop Canus confesseth the contrary, saying: Canus loc. Theol. l. 12. sol. 424. b. 
                     Sedquaeris, quid causae plerisque antiquorum fuerit, vt Baptismum hostiam appellauerint, ideoque dixerint non superesse hostiam pro peccato, quia Baptismus repeti non potest. Sanè quia in Baptismo Christo commorimur, & per hoc Sacramentum applicatur nobis hostia crucis, ad plenam peccati remissionem, hinc illi Baptisma translatitiè hostiam nun cuparunt: that is, But you demaund what cause had many of the ancient Fathers that they called Baptisme a sacrifice, and therefore said, that there remained no sacrifice for sinne, because Baptisme cannot be repeated▪ Truly because in Baptisme we die together with Christ, & by this Sacrament the sacrifice of the Crosse is applied vnto vs, to the full remission of sinne, hence they call Baptisme metaphorically a sacrifice. Here is a cleare confession that many Fathers call Baptisme a sacrifice, and among these many, S. Austin is one, Aust. in exposit. Epist. ad Rom. p. 365. Paris. 1586. 
                     Quod (holocaustum dominicae passionis) eo tempore offert quisque pro peccatis suis, quo eiusdem passionis fide dedicatur & Christianorum fidelium nomine Baptizatus imbuitur, that is, which burnt offering of the Lords passion, euery one offereth

And yet he is offered in a sacrament, not onely at all the solemnities at Easter, but euery day to the people; Neither doth he lye, that being asked, doth answere that he is offered: For if sacraments haue not a certaine resemblance of those things whereof they are sacraments, they should not be sacraments at all. And for this resemblance, they take the names commonly of the things themselues: therefore, as after a certaine maner the sacrament of the Body of Christ, is the Body of Christ, the sacrament of the Blood of Christ, is the Blood of Christ; so the sacrament of faith is faith. And elsewhere, Contra Faust. lib. 20. c. 21.

                     Christ hauing offered himselfe for a soueraigne sacrifice vnto his Father, ordained that we should offer a remembrance thereof vnto God, in stead of a sacrifice. Is not this a plaine demonstration that in the iudgement of Eusebius, there is not in the Lords Supper a sacrifice properly so called, but onely a remembrance in stead of a sacrifice? And this remembrance hee thus describeth;

an vnbloodie sacrifice, as appeareth by his owne words; And pleasing God well, wee offer vnbloodie sacrifices, and reasonable and acceptable to him.

So in him wee haue 318. Bishops, the most reuerent sages and Senate of the Christian world after the Apostles daies, al denying your sacrifice, & maintayning a remembrance in stead of a sacrifice.

                     THe second function of Priest-hood, is the power of absolution which God hath giuen neither to King nor Emperour, to Angell nor Archangell, but onely to the Priest: and in this also Rhem in Ioh. 20. vers. 13. you are defectiue in the Church of England.

                  There is an absolution in the Consistory, and an absolution in the Court of Conscience; the former is from excommunication, and other spirituall censures: the latter (which we meane) is from sinne, and is giuen in Priestly ordination, euen by the words of Christ himselfe. For

                  The very same words are vsed in the Church of England as may appeare by the booke: The forme of ordering of Priests. 
                     The Bishop with the Priests present shall lay there hands seuerally vpon the head of euery one that receiueth Orders: The receiuers humbly kneeling vpon their knees, and the Bishop saying, Receiue the holy ghost, whose sinnes thou dost forgiue they are forgiuen, and whose sinnes thou dost retaine they are retained, and therefore if the power of absolution bee giuen by these words, then it is giuen and receiued in the Church of England.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Not so, for though you haue the words, yet you haue not the true sence of the words: and therefore neither doe your Bishops giue it, nor you receiue it.

                  Then let vs without all partiallity, examine the true sence & meaning of them. For as much therefore as our Sauiour did represent a reall donation both by breathing, and saying, receiue; without all controuersie somewhat was really giuen, & actually received; but what was that? vndoubtedly the holy Ghost; for he said, receiue the holy Ghost. But what is meant by the holy Ghost? It cannot be denied, that they receiued the presence of the spirit for their direction, support and assistance, and the Lord hath promised the same spirit to all faithfull ministers, when he said, Mat. 28. 20. 
                     Behold I am with you (that is with you and your successors) vntill the end of the world. To this purpose it is well spoken of Leo,

It remaineth therefore that we consider what grace that was. It was not the grace of adoption or regeneration, because they had receiued that already, as appeared by the fruits thereof Ioh. 6. 69.

                  Saint Paul saith, 2. Cor. 5. 10. 
                     All things are of God, which hath reconciled vs vnto himselfe by Iesus Christ, and hath giuen vnto vs the Ministery of reconciliation. For God was in Christ and reconciled the world vnto himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them, and hath committed vnto vs the word of reconciliation. Whereby it appeareth that God reconcileth the world properlie, by not imputing their sinnes, the Apostles and other Ministers of the Gospell, ministerially

as Embassadours of Christ, to whom is committed the word and ministery of reconciliation. For what other thing is our forgiuenesse of sinnes then a reconciling of men to God? but we reconcile men to God by preaching and declaring the word of the Gospell, therefore by preaching and declaring the word of the Gospell we forgiue sinnes.

                     There is not onely required to remission of sinnes the Preaching of the Gospell but also baptisme and penance. As it is written, 
                     
                        
                           〈…〉

                  When wee say that the Minister forgiueth sinnes by preaching, wee doe not exclude the Sacraments but include them. As when wee referre a pardon to the Kings letters patents, wee doe not exclude the seale, but meane the letters patents with the seale annexed. For (as the Apostle saith) to vs is committed the ministerie of reconciliation. Which is not a ministerie of the word onely but without all controuersie of the Sacraments also. Therefore Christ in giuing vs authoritie to forgiue sinnes, hath withall giuen vs authoritie to vse the meanes thereof, that is, the ministery of the word and Sacraments, and because wee apply these meanes whereby God forgiueth sinnes, therefore we are said to forgiue sinnes. This is well expressed by Ferus one of your own Fryers saying, 
                        
                           〈…〉

Moreouer it is a cleare case that to this remission there is required faith and repentance, after which followeth ministeriall absolution, by preaching and applying publickly and priuately the sweete promises of grace to the penitent beleeuer, and sealing them by the Sacraments to the soule and conscience. This absolution in the court of conscience is agreeable to the Scripture, and is not onely practised in the Church of England by Sermons and Sacraments, but also solemnly proclaimed in our liturgy, and applied both publickly in open penance, and priuately in the visitation of the sicke, as also to particular penitents, whose wounded consciences require the same.

                     Nunquam sacerdos absolueret quenquam de quo non presumeret quod esset absolutus à deo. i the Priest would neuer absolue any man of whom he did not presume that he were already absolued of God. If the Priest absolue none but whom God hath first absolued, thē what can his absolution be else but a certificate that the party is already absolued of God? And againe, Item Augustinus & Hugo de sancto victore, &c. Moreouer Austin and Hugo de sancto victore say, that in the raising of Lazarus was signified the raising againe of a sinner. But Lazarus was raised of the Lord before he was deliuered to the Disciples to bee loosed, ergo absolutio sacerdotis nihil valet antequam homo sit iustificatus per gratiam & suscitatus a morte culpae. 1. Therefore the absolution of the Priest is of no value before a man be iustified by grace, & raised from the death of sinne. And this he proueth by strong reasons, as followeth, 1. It is a matter of equall power to baptize inwardly, and to absolue from deadly sinne: but it was not requisite that God should communicate to any man) the power of baptizing inwardly, least our hope should be reposed in man: therfore by the same reason it was not fit that God should communicate (to any man) the power of absoluing from actuall sinne. And againe, Nulla fit remissio culpae nisi per gratiam, sed gratiam dare est potentiae infinitae. i. There is no remission of sinne (properly except onely by grace: but to giue grace proceedeth from an infinite power (whereof man is not capable) and therefore no man can forgiue sins properly. And if you be not yet perswaded, how generally this is receiued I will let you see it by the words of Suarez the Iesuite.

And he saith, that the former opinion is maintained by the master, Altisiodorensis, Alex. de Hales, Bonauenture, Gabriel, Maior, Thomas de Argent. Occam, Abulensis, and others.

                     Bellarmine relateth as an argument to prooue that auricular confession is approued by God himselfe. If you beleeue this lying Legend, that the woman was shriuen after her death, then you may like wise beleeue that the Priest absolued her. For by what reason could he denie her absolution, if God raised her by miracle to make confession? Now I would demaund whether this woman dyed in the state of damnation or saluation: if in state of damnation, then the priest could neither iustifie her, nor declare her to be iustified; because they which die in their sinnes, shall perish in their sinnes: but if she dyed in the state of saluation, and yet was raised by miracle to confesse some sinne for the clearing of others, or for some other reason we know not, then the Priest did not properly forgiue her sinnes, but onely pronounce that they were forgiuen. I will close vp this point, with a memorable saying of Fetus in Mat. c. 9. Editio Mogunt. 1559. 
                     Ferus, vpon these wordes, Whose sinnes you forgiue, &c. Non quod homo propriè remittit peccatum sed quod ostendat ac certificet a deo remissum: ne

                     collected from the Metaphor of the keyes; of which it is said,

                     I will giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen For a key vseth not to be made or giuen, to signifie that the doore is open or shut, but to open and shut it indeed. Now that which was promised by the keyes, was performed in that place of Iohn, and therefore here he gaue them power, not onely to declare vnto men that their sinnes are forgiuen, but also to forgiue them indeed.

                  As Adam for his sinne was shut out of Paradise, so all his posterity, proceeding from him by carnall generation, considered in their naturall corruption, are shut and locked out of heauen, into which no vncleane thing can enter. For as the Prophet saith, Esai. 59. 2. 
                     Your iniquities haue made a separation betweene you and your God. Neither is there any hope of saluation, vnlesse the kingdome of heauen bee vnlocked againe. But what is the key to open this locke? There is a threefold key; the first of authoritie, the second of excellency, and the third of Ministery. The key of authoritie belongeth onely to God. For seeing euery sinne is a transgression of Diuine law, he only hath soueraigne authoritie to remit it, against whom it is committed, and when he doth remit it, then he setteth open the gates of heauen. The key of excellency belongeth onely to Christ, God and man, who by his most soueraigne sacrifice hath made satis faction to God the Father, purchased an eternall redemption for vs, and meritoriously opened the kingdome of heauen to all beleeuers. The key of Ministery was giuen to the Apostles, aud their successours, to whom was committed the Ministery of reconciliation: Which is well expressed by S. Amb. de spi

Men doe performe a seruice or Ministery, for the forgiuenesse of sinnes, but they doe not exercise the authoritie of any power for they doe not forgiue sins in their owne name, but in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. They make request, the dietie bestoweth the gift: An office or seruice is performed by man, but the bountiful gift is from supernal power. This supernall power is the key of authoritie: this humane office, is the key of Ministery. For as a key is made and giuen to open the doore indeed: So God gaue the key of Ministery vnto his stewards to open the doore of heauen indeed. But how? not by authority as God the Father, nor by excellencie, as God the Son, but by a ministeriall forgiuenes of sins, which is not to be restrained onely to the hearing of priuate confessions, as though in that

one point lay all the vertue and vse of the Keyes, but consisteth in reuealing and applying the merits of Christ, publikely and priuately to the soule and conscience, and in assuring those that beleeue and repent of their eternall saluation. Now whereas you say, that a Key is not giuen to signifie or declare that the doore is open; it is true. Yet you may know that similitudes must not be extended to euery circumstance; it is sufficient if there be a correspondencie in the maine point. What though a Key cannot declare that the doore is open? Yet it is the Ministers duety to declare, that heauen is opened to all that beleeue and repent; and this very declaring is an effectuall meanes of opening it indeed. For as when Christ vnfolded the Scriptures, the Luke 24. 32. 
                     hearts of the two Disciples did burne within them: so when the Ministers declare the glad tidings of the Gospel, God kindleth faith and repentance in the hearts of his chosen; and when they doe beleeue and repent, then the Minister may safely pronounce the forgiuenesse of their sinnes, by the Blood of Iesus Christ. Thus he is Gods effectuall instrument to accomplish it, and his Herald to proclaime it.

                        . serut. sacerdot. pag. 76. owne men distinguish betweene the Key of excellencie, and the Key of Ministerie. Secondly, euen those things which are most proper vnto Christ, are ascribed to his Ministers; as for example the saluation of mens soules. For S. Paul saith to Timothy, 
                     1. Tim. 4. 16. 
                     In doing this, thou shalt saue both thy selfe, and them that heare thee. In like maner they may be said to forgiue sinnes, and open the Kingdome of heauen. But this is spoken by a figure, whereby that which belongeth to the principall agent, is ascribed to the instrument. And that no marueile, seeing a man by turning from wickednes, and doing that which is right, is said to Ezech. 18. 27. 
                     saue his owne soule.

                     Bell. de paenit. lib. 3. c. 2. A second Argument may be collected from the Metaphor of binding and loosing, which doth not signifie to declare that one is bound or loosed, but to lay on or take off bonds and fetters indeed.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  This is in effect the same with the former: therefore I referre you to the former answere.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Ibidem. A third Argument may be drawne from this very place of S. Iohn: For Christ expresly giueth them power not only to forgiue sinnes, but also to retaine; Retinere autem quid est nisi nolle remittere? i. What is it to retaine, but to be vnwilling to forgiue? therefore remission is denied to them, whom the Priest will not forgiue.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  True, if the will of the Priest be guided by the rules of true

Religion. For he should be vnwilling to forgiue none, but onely those that are vnbeleeuing, and vnrepentant; from absoluing of whom he should be so farre, that it is his duety to denounce Gods wrath and iudgment against them if they continue obstinate.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Ibidem. The Lord saith not, Whose sinnes you shall forgiue they were forgiuen, which he would haue said, if by remission he had meant declaration: but he saith, They are forgiuen, because Christ doeth ratifie the sentence, which the Priest pronounceth in his Name.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  But the Priest must absolue no man, sauing those whom God hath first absolued, as you heard before, and is plainely deliuered by Pope Gregorie, 
                     Greg. Hom. 26. in Euang. 
                     Quos omnipotens Deus per compunctionis gratiam visitat, illos pastoris sententia absoluat. Tunc enim vera est absolutio praesidētis, cum aeterni arbitrium sequitur iudicis: i. Let the sentence of the Pastour absolue them whom Almighty God doth visit with the grace of compunction; for then is the absolution of the Spirituall ruler a true absolution, when hee followeth the will of the Eternall Iudge. And againe, Ibidem. 
                     Nos debemus per Pastoralem authoritatem soluere, quos authorem nostrum cognoscimus per suscitantem gratiam viuificare, i. Wee ought absolue those by our Pastorall authority, whom we know that our Authour Christ Iesus hath reuiued with his quickening grace. Otherwise his absolution is vaine. For as the Legall Priest did not properly cleanse the Leper, yet he is said to 
                     Leuit. 14. 11. 
                     cleanse him, because hee declared him cleane whom the Lord had cleansed: so the Euangelicall Priest, though hee doe not properly absolue from sinnes, yet hee is said to absolue, because he declareth him absolued, whom the Lord hath absolued. Wherefore the meaning of Christs words is this, Whose sinnes you forgiue, that is, whose sinnes, according to the rules of my Gospel you shal pronounce to be forgiuen, they are forgiuen; That is, they are so certainly forgiuen, that the sentence you pronounce in earth, shall be ratified in Heauen, as it is written, Whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shall be bound in Heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in Heauen. So here are three things: First, God the Father for Christs sake forgiueth sinnes: Secondly the Minister declareth that God hath forgiuen them: Thirdly, this declaratory sentence is ratified in Heauen.

A fourth Argument may be drawne from this word Quorum, in this maner; The Gospel is preached indefinitely to all men, But it is not the will of God that this absolution should be giuen to all men, but to certaine persons only, whom the Priest iudgeth fit: as appeareth by these words, Quorum peccata, &c. Whose sinnes you forgiue, &c.

                  The Gospel is preached generally and indefinitely, to all men, Whosoeuer beleeueth and repenteth shall be saued; yet so, that in the generall is included this particular, If thou beleeue and repent, thou shall be saued. Now a mans conscience sanctified by the Holy Ghost, doth say, I beleeue and repent: Therefore to him the generall promise of the Gospel is made particular, by particular application, and to such onely making a sincere profession of their faith and repentance, the Minister ought to pronounce forgiuenes of sinnes.

                     the gift of forgiuing of sinnes, not by preaching as you dreame, but plainely by quenching and dissoluing them. For as the winde doth quench the fire, and scater the clouds: so the absolution of the Priest doth scatter sinnes, and maketh them to vanish: according to which Metaphor we read in Esay, Esay 44. 22. 
                     I haue blotted out thy sinnes as a cloud.
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Christ did breath, to signifie, that this heauenly gift proceeded from himselfe, and therefore our Bishops when they vtter these words doe not breath, because they are not Authors of this spiritual power, but only Gods delegates and assignes to giue men possession of his graces. Moreouer Christ by breathing did signifie, that none was fit for this heauenly function but such as he enabled with his spirit, and also that this holy spirit should assist his ministers in the dispelling of sins. Neither is the place of Esay for your purpose: when the sky is darkned with clouds and mists, the Lord sendeth a wind out of his treasure house, whereby they are scattered, the skie cleared, and the golden beames of the sunne restored: euen so, when the poore soule and conscience is ouercast with clouds of sin, and mists of sorrow, God by his holy spirit concurring with his blessed word, bringeth men to faith and repentance, and so forgiueth their sins, that he will neuer remember them any more. But what is this to your Popish absolution?

                     Chrysostome proceedeth, and telleth how earthly Princes haue power, To bind the body only, but the Priests bond toucheth the soule, and reacheth vnto heauen. Now earthly Princes doe not declare who is bound or loosed, but bind or loose their bodies indeed, and therefore the Priests in binding and loosing of soules doe not declare who are bound or loosed, but by authority in the roome of Christ doe bind or loose them indeed; if the comparison of Chrysostome be of any value.

                     Chrysostome vpon these words whose sins you retaine they are retained, saith, What power I pray you can be greater then this? but it is no great matter

to declare that sins are forgiuen to the beleeuers, and retained to the vnbeleeuers. For any man may perfourme it which can read the Gospell, neither Priests onely but the layity also, neither Catholikes onely but Heretikes also, yea and the diuells themselues.

                  It is no great matter to pronounce the words, but the excellency of the Ministery consisteth in this, that they doe it ex officio, and that according to Gods owne ordinance, therefore in the reuerend performance therof they may expect a comfortable blessing.

                     Chrysostome saith, The Father hath giuen al maner of power to his sonne, and I see the same power in all variety giuen to them by the sonne, but the Father did not giue to the sonne a bare ability to declare the Gospell, but by authority to forgiue sinnes, therefore the like is giuen to the Priests?
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The power which the Father gaue to Christ conteineth all power in heauen and in earth, but I hope you will not say that Christ gaue all power in heauen and earth to his disciples, therefore the words of Chrysostome need a gentle interpretation, and must not bee taken litterally as they sound, but for a rhetoricall amplification. Againe, the power to forgiue sins is giuen to Christ, and to his Disciples, but not in the same manner, for God the Father forgiueth sinnes, by not imputing them, Christ, God and Man meritoriously, the Ministers onely Ministerially as you heard before.

                     Ibidem pergit Chrys. Chrysostome compareth a Priest not with the kings Herald, which only declareth what is done, but with one who hath power to east into prison, and deliuer out of prison: how could he more openly declare that the Priests power is truly iudiciall?

                  The Herald only proclaimeth the kings pardon, and is no instrument to effect it; but the minister so proclaimeth saluation by Iesus Christ that he is Gods instrument to worke it, so the ministeriall declaration is not a bare, but an effectuall declaration that mens sinnes are forgiuen. For first the Law must bee effectually preached, to humble the soule, then the Gospell must bee effectually applied to kindle true faith. And as the Minister is Gods effectuall instrument in working: so he is his Ambassadour effectually to minister comfort to the penitent soule. Yet for all this he doth not forgiue sinnes properlie, but onely ministerially. The like is to bee said of his deliuering the soules of men out of prison. For that it cannot bee meant properly may appeare by the other branch, because the Minister doth not properly cast any man into the spirituall prison, but the wicked being already imprisoned and

                        . Chrysostome makes an other comparison betweene the legall Priests and the Euangelicall; for the Legall did purge the leprosie of the body, or rather not purge it, but examine those that were purged: But it is granted to our Priests not to purge the leprosie of the body, but the spots of the soule, I doe not say to examine them being purged, but altogether to purge them. In this place to vse the words of Cardinall Bellarmine, Saint Chrysostome doth so plainely condemne the opinion of our aduersaries, that nothing at all can be answered for them.

                  Doth the Priest altogether purge the spots of the soule? then it seemeth when the penitent is presented before the Priest, his soule is spotted, but by vertue of the Priestes absolution the spots are presently washed away; but I pray you tel me, whom doth the Priest forgiue and absolue? him whom the Lord hath absolued? or him whom the Lord hath not absolued? if the Priest absolue him whom the Lord hath absolued, then hee doth not altogether purge the spot of the soule, no nor properly purge them at all, but onely declare that the Lord hath purged them. If you say that the Priest absolueth him whom the Lord hath not absolued, then hee shall bee forgiuen, whom the Lord hath not forgiuen: which is most absurd. Againe, doeth the Priest before hee pronounce absolution see any tokens of faith and repentance: If hee see none, then how dare he pronounce absolution? and if hee see any then the party is already purged. Whereby it appeareth that the absolution of the ministerie is onely declaratorie. Therefore the speech of Chrysostome cannot bee taken properly, but his meaning must bee this, that the Priest seeing him brought by the ministery of the Gospell to faith and repentance, and consequently purged, certifieth his conscience, that he is altogether purged, and his sinnes washed away by the blood of Iesus Christ.

Wee must not thinke that this is spoken of the last iudgement, but the seates of prelates, and prelates themselues, by whom the Church is now gouerned are to be vnderstood, neither can we better apply it to any iudgement giuen, then to that of which it is said, whatsoeuer you bind in earth, shall be bound in heauen.

                  According to Saint Ierom the Bishop or Priest doth bind or loose as the Leuitical Priests did make the lepers cleane and vncleane. Which in his iudgement was not properly, but because they had the knowledge of leprous, and not leprous: and should discerne who was cleane and vncleane. This is that which Saint Ierom meaneth, when hee saith they iudge after a sort before the day of iudgement: which kind of iudgement wee acknowledge.

                  Wee haue: for first the partie maketh a profession of his faith and repentance vnto the Minister; here is causae cognitio: and then the Minister by the authoritie which Christ hath committed vnto him, pronounceth forgiuenesse of his sinnes; here is sententiae dictio. This is the practise of the Church of England agreeable to the law of God, and the ancient Fathers. But if by causae cognitio, you meane a particular enumeration of all their sinnes, as a matter necessarie to saluation, and by sententiae dictio, vnderstand such a sentence as imposeth workes of penance satisfactorie to God; when you can proue them out of the Scripture we will embrace them▪ in the meane time wee knowe them not. Hitherto of Saint Ierom. The same answere also may serue for the place of Saint Austin, if he meane the same iudgement.

                     Austin writeth plainely that some desiring to be reconciled, and therefore beleeuing in Christ do perish euerlastingly, because they die before they could be absolued by a Priest. An non cogitamus, &c. i. Do we not consider when men are come to the extremitie of such dangers, and haue no meanes to fly from them, what a running together there vseth to be in the Church of both sexes of all ages, some carnestly desiring Baptisme, others reconciliation, others the action of penaunce it selfe, all desiring comfort, and the making and deliuering of the Sacraments; where if Ministers bee wanting, how great destruction doth follow them which depart out of this world, either not regenerate or bound? And moreouer how great mourning there is of their faithfull friends, which shall not haue them with them, in the rest of life eternall? And Leo writeth the like to Theodorus. Out of which places we vnderstand that sacramentall reconciliation hath power to iustifie, and is not onely a declaration of iustification alreadie receiued or hereafter to be receiued.

                     Austin doth not say, that some desiring to be reconciled and therefore beleeuing in Christ, doe perish euerlastingly. For he knew very well that this is contrary to the Scripture, which saith, Ioh. 3. 15. 
                     He that beleeueth shall neuer perish, but haue life euerlasting. Therefore it is most certaine that the true beleeuer cannot perish for want of a Priest. If you ground vpon these words, some desiring Baptisme, others reconciliation, they are not referred to the parties themselues which were in danger of death being as yet vnbaptised & vnreconciled, but to their friends, which flocked together in respect of their danger: therefore it doth not appeare that Austin speaketh of such as desired reconciliation; but rather the contrary, for ligati are such as stand bound with the chaines of their sinnes. You will say, how doe they perish for want of a Priest? I answere that if one were present which by commission from Christ might display the riches of Gods mercy vnto them, who can tell whether their hearts might be opened to beleeue and repent vnto saluation, and so their chaines might be loosed? but when there is none present, that can minister a word of comfort vnto them, they being knowen to be notorious sinners may be thought to perish for want of a Priest, not for want of a Popish but for want of a preaching Priest. Which may yet appeare more plainely by the other branch of the vnbaptised. For these wordes (desiring Baptisme) must be either referred to the parties or to their friends. If the parties desire Baptisme, then they doe not perish for want of Baptisme, for the Baptisme of the spirit doth supplie the want of the Baptisme of water. Bell. de sacr. bapt. cap. 6. At sint. 
                     Bellarmine himselfe saith, Sine dubio credendum est veram conuersionē supplere baptismum aquae, cum non ex contemptu sed ex necessitate sine baptismo aquae aliqui decedunt. i. Wee must beleeue without doubt that true conuersion doth supply the Baptisme of water, when as any depart this life, without the Baptisme of water, not of contempt, but by reason of necessity. And this he prooueth first by the Prophet Eze. 18.

                     Austin, that the inuisible sanctification is to some both present and profitable without the visible Sacraments. Wherefore, if the parties desire Baptisme, they cannot perish for want of a Priest. And if you referre this desire of baptisme not to the parties, but to their friends, then you must likewise referre the desire of reconciliation; & so you confirme my former speach, & cōfute your owne; thus much for answere to your first reason, let vs heare the second.

                     Secondly, if the Priest did forgiue sinnes onely by declaration, then it is vaine and ridiculous, to absolue those that are deafe, and voide of sences. But in the old Church, not onely the deafe, but such also as by reason of sickenesse were beside themselues, were sometimes reconciled as appeares by Aug. l. 1. de adulter. Coniug.

                  They reconciled not all, that were deafe and dumbe, and bereft of sences, but onely those that either before by their words and deeds, or then presently by their signes did testifie their repentance, as may appeare by the places alleadged. For Austin saith, Si desperati & intra se penitentes iacuerint, nec pro se respondere potuerint, baptizandos puto. i. If they shall lie without all hope of recouering their bodily health, hauing repentance within themselues, and not able to answere for thēselues, in my opinion they ought to be baptised. And a little after, Quae autem baptismatis, eadem reconciliationis est causa: i. that cause which moueth vs to confer baptisme, may moue vs to giue recōciliatiō. And Leo saith, if by any force of sicknes they shallbe so oppressed, that they are not able to signifie in the presence of the Priest, that thing which a little before they desired, the testimonies of the faithfull, which are about them, shouldbe profitable vnto them, that they may obtaine the benefit both of penitence and of reconciliation. And the 4. Councel of Carthage saith, He that desireth penitence in his sicknes, if by chance (while the Priest cōmeth vnto him) he shall become dumbe, or fall into a frenzy, let those which heard him giue testimony, and let him receiue penitēce. And the Councel of Orenge saith, he which is sodenly dumb, may be baptised and receiue penitence, if he haue testimony of others, that hee was formerly willing, or do manifest his present will by his signes. Now to reconcile men in these cases, is neither vaine nor ridiculous, although it be done only by way of declaratiō. For if they vnderstād what is done, it bringeth vnto thē a singular comfort: if they be past sence, yet if God shal restore them, whē they heare what was done it will reioyce them: and if they doe not recouer, yet it shall bring this benefit to all that shall heare it, that Gods messenger vpon due examination, hath pronounced that they dyed in faith and repentance.

                     Ex bell. ibidem. Yertio. If absolution be only declaratory, then this declaration is either absolute or conditionall. If it be absolute, then it is either rash or superfluous. For if the Priest know not whether the party hath faith and repentance, and yet pronounce absolutely that his sinnes are forgiuen, then hee cannot bee excused from rashnesse: and if hee know it in some sort, yet because

the party knoweth it better then hee, his declaration shall be superfluous. And if the declaration be onely conditionall, then it cannot comfort the conscience; and consequently it is to no end, and therefore both rash and superfluous.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  The declaration is conditionall. For though vpon due and speciall consideration, wee may say priuately and particularly to this or that man; i pronounce that thy sinnes are forgiuen thee: yet this is alwayes to be vnderstood with a secret condition; and the condition is this, If thou beleeue and repent: Neither may wee pronounce it otherwise, then vpon a charitable perswasion proceeding vpon probable grounds, that this condition is fulfilled.

                  Yes, for the party knowing in his owne soule that he made a sincere confession, is comforted by the messenger of the Lord of Hostes, declaring ex officio, the sweet promises of the Gospel, according to Christs appointment.

                     If it be onely declaratory, then it may be performed by a Lay-man, by a woman, a childe, an infidel, yea by the diuell himselfe, yea by a Parret if he be taught to speake, as well as by a Priest.

                  Who taught this Parret thus to speake, let wise men iudge. But to the point; A man may be said to pronounce and declare remission of sinnes two wayes. First, by a narratiue and historicall rehearsall out of the generall duetie of charitie; and so may euery Christian. Secondly, by a Ministeriall power giuen by a speciall commission from God, adorned and established with a speciall promise, and so may euery lawfull Minister. The commission is giuen vs in our Ordination, Whose sinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen. The promise was made in these words, Behold, I am with you vntill the end of the world. Both are expressed in these words of Iob 33. 23. 
                     Iob, If there be an Angel with him, (that is with the man whose soule draweth neere vnto the graue) or an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnes, then will hee haue mercy vpon him, and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation. Here are two persons to be considered. First, a man lying at the point of death, distressed and groning vnder the burthen of his sinnes; Secondly, the man of God appointed to comfort those that mourne in Sion. The latter is described foure wayes: by his Titles, Office, Commission, and Gods promise vnto him. His Titles are an Angel or interpreter: his Office, to declare vnto man his righteousnes; that is, the righteousnes of Iesus Christ imputed to all beleeuers, according to the couenant of grace: his Commission, Deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit: The promise, Then will God haue mercie vpon him, and say, I haue receiued a reconciliation. Such Titles, such Office, by such speciall Commission and promise, are not giuen to any Lay man in the Booke of God. Wherefore, though they are bound by their generall calling, to edifie and comfort one another, yet this belongeth to the Minister in a speciall maner. Neither is there any doubt but God will giue

a speciall blessing to his owne Ordinance. Thus haue we examined all Bellarmines arguments, and find them to be nothing els but smoke: He hath sowne the winde, and reaped the whirlewinde. Hitherto of Absolution, as it belongeth to the Minister. Now the parts of penance which you require in the penitent, as Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction, may bee passed ouer, because wee speake of the Priest, and not of the penitent. Yet giue me leaue to tell you, that Auricular confession, as it is vsed in the Church of Rome, is a pollicie to diue into the secrets of men, not so much to apply salues vnto their sores, or to yeeld true comfort to the wounded conscience, as to worke for your owne aduantage, and to turne all things to your owne pleasure and profit. If you say, that this may be the fault of some particular men, and not of the Church: yet to vrge it as you doe, as a thing Conc. Trid. sess. 4. Can. 7. 
                     necessary to saluation by Law diuine, is the fault of your Church. Surely this doctrine was not knowne to Confess. lib. 10. c. 3. 
                     S. Austine, when he said, Quid mihi cum hominibus vt audiant confessiones meas quasi ipsi sanaturi sint omnes languores meos? i. What haue I to doe with men that they should heare my Confessions, as though they should heale all my diseases? Nor to Chrysost. in Psalm. 50. Hom. 2. 
                     Chrysostome, who saith, Art thou ashamed to confesse thy sinnes? rehearse them dayly in thy prayers: for I doe not say that thou shouldest disclose them to thy fellow seruant, who may mocke thee, but to God who healeth them. And as for your Popish Satisfaction it is a most blasphemous derogation from the all sufficient Satisfaction of our Sauiour Iesus Christ. For you doe not meane thereby a satisfaction to the party offended, nor Canonicall satisfaction to the Congregation for the taking away of publique scandall, (both which we willingly embrace) but you teach that after the Priest hath forgiuen the penitent his sinnes, there still remaineth the very same

Thus you haue turned repentance into a Sacrament of penance, and penance into Mines of siluer and gold. Hitherto of our Presbyters.

                  That the Deacon should assist the Priest in the administration of holy things concerning his office, is graunted on both sides; but for your Popish massing and sacrifising, we haue proued, that it is a profaning of Christs ordinance, and that it is neither lawfull for you to do it, nor for the Deacons to assist you: wherefore seeing wee haue already iustified both our Bishops which ordaine, & the office or function of our Presbyters or Priests, wee conclude, that as our Bishops and Presbyters, so our Deacons also are lawfull in the Church of England. Thus haue we examined your obiections against the ministery of the Church of England, and find them to be meere cauilles. Neither can you proue that our calling is in any thing, contrarie to the Scripture, or to the practise of reuerend antiquity, but your sacrifising Priesthood appeareth not onely to bee the inuention of man, but also sacrilegious, and abominable in the sight of God. Wherefore I beseech you repent of your sinnes, renounce your Antichristian practise, returne to your deare Country, cease to bee Philodox, and become an Orthodox.

                     WEll, I perceiue one thing that howsoeuer you speake against Popish Priests, calling them sacrilegious and abominable, yet when your owne calling is put to the trial, you are glad to deriue it from such Bishops as were Popish Priests, which you so disdainefully call sacrilegious and abominable.

                  And I perceiue another thing, that howsoeuer you exclaimed against Cranmer as a Schismaticke, and burned him for an Heriticke: yet when the glorious succession of your Bishops in Queene Maries time, is put to the trial, you are forced to deriue it from him whom you so scornefully call a Schismatike and an Hereticke. But if our forefathers deriued their orders from such Bishops as were Popish Priests, what inconuenience will follow?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Then either confesse your calling to bee vnlawfull, or accknowledge ours to be lawfull, from whence you deriue it: You cannot gather figges of thornes, nor grapes of thistles, neither is it possible for a rose to spring out of a nettle.

                  But a garden of Roses may be ouergrowne with nettles. For the Ministery planted by Christ, was a sweete rose without any nettle; and so

it continued in the Church for certaine ages: but when Antichrist began to reueale himselfe in the Temple of God as though hee were God, the Romish Priesthood became a monstrous birth, strangely compounded, halfe rose, halfe nettle: the Church of England in the beginning of reformation did borrow from the Church of Rome the rose, but left the nettle.

                  Your Popish Priests are neither the true ministers of the Gospel, nor merely lay-men. For your ordination consisteth of two parts; the former in these words, take thou power to offer sacrifice, and to celebrate masse for the quick and the dead, which you account the principall function of Christian Priesthood, but in truth it maketh you not the Ministers of Christ, but of Antichrist: the latter in these words, receiue the holy ghost, whose sins thou forgiuest, they are forgiuen, & whose thou retainest, they are retained, in which Euangelicall words, there is deliuered a ghostly ministeriall power to forgiue sinnes, which according to the true meaning of Christ is performed by the ministery of reconciliation, therefore whosoeuer hath receiued this power, hath withall receiued the ministery of reconcilation, consisting as was before declared in the due administration of the word and sacraments.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  If it be so, then you must confesse that the Priesthood of the Church of Rome hath the ministeriall function, because these words are vsed in our ordination.

                  Though these words as they were spoken by Christ, practised in the primitiue Church, and are vsed at this day in the Church of England, imply the substance of this holy function, yet as you abuse them in the Church of Rome, to maintaine Popish shrift, the gold is couered with drosse, and the sweet flower ouershadowed with noysome weeds. Wherefore if we consider your Priesthood, as it is a totum aggregatum, consisting of sacrifising and absoluing, it is vnlawfull and contrary to the Scripture: If wee come to the parts thereof, your massing and sacrifising is simply abominable: the other part so farre as it relieth vpon the words of Christ, taken in their true sense and meaning, is holy, and implieth a ministerial power, which notwithstanding, by your construction and practise is greatly depraued.

Among which Articles this is one, Artic. 31. 
                     The offering of Christ once made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sinnes of the whole world, both originall and actuall: and there is no other satisfaction for sinne, but that alone. Wherefore the Sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer Christ for the quicke and the dead, to haue remission of paine or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits. By this you may plainely perceiue, that no popish Priest can possibly be admitted in the Church of England, vnlesse he vtterly disclaime and renounce the first function of your Priesthood, which consisteth in Massing and Sacrifising, and the latter also so farre as it is contrary to the doctrine of the Church of England. But whatsoeuer is in it from God, and according to the true sence of the Scripture, as for example, the power of forgiuing sinnes by the ministery of reconciliation that we embrace and acknowledge. It is a Rose which is found in the Romish wildernes, but the plants thereof were deriued from the garden of God: It is a riuer which runneth in Egypt, but the fountaine and spring of it is in Paradise: it is a beame which is seene in Babylon, but the original of it is from the sphere of heauen. Wherefore when your Priestes returne to vs. Our Church paring away their pollutions, suffereth them to execute their ministeriall function, according to the true meaning of Christs words.

For there are two great faults in that state; one that they are not rightly instituted to the Ecclesiasticall office: another that they haue depriued themselues from that degeee by doing nothing belonging to the matter. But this doth not hinder that they may be acknowledged for ordinarie ministers when they shew themselues ready to ioyne themselues to the Church, & so may be confirmed againe a new, to correct their former default.

                  Heere you see that they did not ordaine them a new, but onely supply that which they thought to be wanting, and therefore they misliked not our orders in whole but in part.

                  Yes they wholly misliked them, as you may see by the words: considering they were not ordered in very deed. If they were not ordered in very deed, then howsoeuer they pretended orders, yet they had no orders at all, but were meerely lay men, and so are you. For that which they call the new sort and fashion of orders, was according to the booke established by King Edward, which is vsed in England to this very day.

                     I answere that Priests are ordained when it is said vnto them, take thou power to offer sacrifice, but they are also ordained afterward, when it is said vnto them, Receiue the holy Ghost. For by the former wordes they are ordained to the function of sacrificing, by the latter to the function of absoluing, by both ioyntly to the full and perfect order of Priesthood.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  But these words; Receiue the holy Ghost, were vsed in king Edwards time, and are to this day in the Church of England, in making of Ministers. And therefore those that are promoted to orders after the new sort and fashion as you call it, are ordered in very deed, neither did the Penners of the article meane otherwise.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Are not their words plaine that they were not ordered in very deed?
                  
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  They meant that they were not ordered fully and perfectly, & therfore aduised the Bishops to supply that which wanted, Which they could not say with reason, if they had thought them to be meerely lay men; therefore they iudged them to bee Priests in part, and yet part of the office to bee wanting, which needed supply. That which they had, was the power receiued by these wordes, Receiue the holy Ghost. That which they supposed to be wanting, was the power of sacrificing. Therefore their meaning was not to reiterate that which they had, but to supply that which was wanting in their cō
                     ceit, euen as we on the contrary side cause such as come from Popery to vs to renounce the power of sacrificing which we hold sacrilegious, but doe not reiterate those Euangelicall words, wherin we agree. And this you must needes grant vnlesse you will allow of reordination.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  
                     Reordination? God forbid. No sir we will neuer allow of that. For order imprinteth a Character, and therefore can neuer be reiterated.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  But you granted before that a Priest is ordained when the

Bishop saith vnto him, Receiue the holy Ghost. And therefore if the power of remitting sinnes giuen in these words, were reiterated either in Queene Maries time, or among you at this day in ordaining your proselytes, then you cannot possibly defend your Church from Reordination. If you abhorre Reordination, then you must confesse that when any Minister reuolteth from vs to you, yet in making him Priest you must not repeat those words, Receiue the holy Ghost, which proueth inuincibly, that vnlesse you will be contrary vnto your selues, you cannot esteeme vs to bee meerely lay men. Or if you will needs aduance your owne orders, and make a nullitie in ours, and order our fugitiue Ministers accordingly, then you must runne (there is no remedy) vpon the rocke of Reordination by repeating the words wherein we agree.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  Though we agree in the wordes, yet we differ in the sense.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  That is no barre to Reordination; for if a child bee Baptised in the true forme of words, & an Heretick shall Baptise the same child in the same wordes, though in another sense, yet all good Christians will iudge it to be Rebaptisation; and there is the same reason of Reordination. Therefore thus I reason. When you Metamorphise an English Minister, into a Popish Priest, either you repeat the words, Receiue the holy Ghost, or you doe not: if you doe repeat them, then I haue made it manifest, that you vse Reordination. If you doe not, then you iustifie not onely our practise, but also our orders. For you hold these words necessary in ordination, to the conferring of one of the principall functions of Priesthood, and therfore in not repeating them you acknowledge that they had receiued that function before, in the Church of England, & consequently that the ministers of England are not lay men. So your owne practise, doth either condemne your selues, or iustifie vs, but our practise condemneth altogether the first part of your Priesthood, that is, your carnall sacrificing as simply abhominable: and the latter part so farre as it is polluted with your popish constructions.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  If the first part of our Priesthood bee simply abhominable, and the latter as it is vsed by vs bee polluted, then Cranmer, Ridley, Parker, Grindall, and the rest of your Coronels, had no other Priesthood, but that which was partly abhominable and partly polluted.
               
               
                  ORTHO.
                  When God opened their eyes, they did vtterly renounce your carnall sacrificing, as derogating from the all-sufficient sacrifice of Iesus Christ; the other part, that is, the power of forgiuing sinnes which they receiued corruptly in the Church of Rome, they practised purely in the Church of England, renouncing the Pope and all Popish pollutions.
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  But when the question is concerning the validity of orders, wee must not so much respect the practise as the power receiued in ordination, how Cranmer, Parker, and such like receiued both parts of their Priesthood in the Church of Rome. And as the Church gaue them so they receiued them, in that very sense which the Church of Rome holdeth at this day. Wherefore seeing you condemned both parts, as we vse them for nettles, I cannot but maruell how you can be Roses.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  Let me aske you a question; If one Baptize a Conuert in the Element of water, according to the true forme of the Church, yet so, that both the Baptizer and the baptized haue some pernicious errour: as for example,

If they deny the Godhead of the Sonne, or of the holy Ghost, shall this hinder the validitie of the Baptisme?
               
               
                  PHIL.
                  No: for you must consider that there is a visible Priest, and an inuisible. It is required to the substance of Baptisme, that the visible Priest apply water to the baptized, In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. If he faile in any of these points, the Baptisme is frustrate. And therefore it was decreed in the great Councell of Can. 19. 
                     Nice, that the Paulianists should be rebaptized; where they take the word rebaptised improperly, meaning that the former was not performed in the true wordes, and therefore was in deed no Baptisme. But if it were duely performed in water with such words as Christ hath appointed, their priuate opinions and misconstruction, cannot hinder the validitie of the Baptisme.

                     S. Austin) ad Baptismum qui verbis Euangelicis consecratur, non pertinere cuiusquam vel dantis, vel accipientis errorem siue de Patre, siue de Filio, siue de Spiritu sancto, aliter sentiat quam coelesiis doctrina insinuat. i. We haue sufficiently declared, that to the Baptisme which is consecrated with Euangelicall words, pertaineth not the errour of any man, either of the giuer, or of the receiuer, whether he thinke otherwise, then the heauenly doctrine teacheth of the Father, or of the Sonne, or of the holy Ghost. For whosoeuer be the Minister, Christ the inuisible Priest is the principall Baptizer, and therefore if the right Element and forme of words be vsed, we regard not the erronious sense of the seruant, but the true sense of the Lord and Master.
               
               
                  ORTHOD.
                  So I say to you, there is a visible Bishop, and an inuisible; if the visible shall impose hands vpon a capable person, vsing those Euangelicall words which Christ hath sanctified, his owne priuate opinions cannot hinder the validitie of the Ordination: for so that right and sufficient words be vsed, we will not respect the erronious construction of the seruant, but the true sense and meaning of the Lord and Master. Therefore though Cranmer and Parker were ordained in the rite of the Church of Rome, though both the ordainers gaue the power, and the ordained receiued it in the erronious sense of the Church of Rome; yet neither the error of the ordainers, nor of the ordained, pertaineth to the Ordination. As Christ is the chiefe Baptizer, so he is the chiefe Ordainer: for Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 
                     hee giueth Pastours and teachers, for the consummation of the Saints. Wherefore, when God vouchsafed to take away the scales of ignorance from the eyes of his blessed instruments which he vsed in the reformation of Religion, it was their duetie not to follow the erronious sense of the visible Bishop, but the true meaning of the inuisible Bishop, who was the authour of these holy and admirable words, Receiue the holy Ghost, &c. In which words of Christ, that was accomplished, which was promised by the keyes, which keyes the See Bishop Iewel def. par. 2. c. 7. di

                     Adrian, the key of ministery: so whosoeuer is ordained by these words, receiueth the keyes, and may open the kingdome of heauen, by the Word and Sacraments. Wherfore seeing these words were retained in the Ordination of Priests, euen in the darkenesse of Poperie, it followeth that the Church of Rome had power by these words, rightly vnderstood according to the Scripture, to minister the word and Sacraments. But that which in it selfe was lawfull, to them was made vnlawfull, by adding the abhomination of sacrifising, and by wresting the

words of Christ to their Popish shrift. Thus though the Church of Rome gaue her Priests authority to preach the truth, yet she did not reueale the truth vnto them but plunged them in ignorance and errors. Therefore whereas those words of Christ (in themselues a Rose) by corruption of time were ouergrowne with nettles, those heroicall spirits which reformed religion, did weede away the Romane nettles, and so there remained onely the sweet Rose of Iesus Christ. Thus it came to passe that that which was practised in the Church of Rome vnlawfully, as beeing polluted with wicked humane inuentions, was by the goodnesse of God purged and restored to the orient colour, and natiue purity. To conclude, in the primitiue Church, the ministeriall power was receiued purely, and deliuered purely; In the beginning of Popery, it was receiued purely, and deliuered corruptly: During the sway of Popery it was receiued corruptly and deliuered corruptly: In the beginning of the reformation it was receiued corruptly, and deliuered purely: Now in the sun shine of the Gospell, it is receiued purely and deliuered purely. Thus it appeareth that although we receiued our Orders from such as were Popish Priests, yet our calling is lawfull, which was to be declared. Now the Lord of his mercy so blesse his owne ordinance, that we may vse this holy function to his glory, and the winning of many thousand soules. Amen.

               137. This was the first ordering of Master Iewell, and the rest as I haue beene informed by one that heard it from Master Neale reader of the Hebrew Lecture in Oxford, who was there present, and an eye witnesse of what was done and past▪ &c.

               He heard credibly reported that some of our new superintendents were made Bishops at the Nagges-head in Cheape. Whereupon, because I would deale candidè with my aduersary, and propose his obiection with most probability, I brought it against the first Bishop, consecrated in the Queenes time, that is, Archbishop Parker, and cleered him from this reproach. For can any man of reason imagine, that they would goe to consecrate one another in a Tau

               rne, and so incurre the danger of the Law, after that they had according to their hearts desire an Archbishop of their owne religion, quietly possessed of his Church and Chaire? But now the Authour of the Preface affirmeth in particular, that Iewell, Sands, Horne and Grindal were there, then, and in that maner Consecrated by Scory, and Scory by some of them, saith Sacroboscus.
            
            To answere briefly (for the glasse is almost runne,) First, it is a sillie surmise that Bishop Scory should be Consecrated by them, seeing he was See aboue pag. 93. 
               Consecrated by Archbishop Cranmer and other Bishops in the time of King Edward. Secondly▪ those reuerend Prelates, See pag. 134. 
               Grindall, and See pag. 135. 
               Sands, were both Consecrated vpon one day by Matthew Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by

three other Bishops, as you haue heard out of the Records. To which I adde moreouer, vpon a reuiew of the same Records, that the place of their Consecration was, the Chappell at Lambehith: the time, the Sabboth day in the forenoone after Morning prayer: the maner, with imposition of hands, and such forme of words and Praiers as are vsed in the Church. For the better performance whereof; there was a Sermon Preached by Master Alexander No well, then the Archbishops Chaplaine, vpon this Text; Acts 20. 28 
               Take heed vnto your selues, and to all the flocke whereof the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers; And a Communion reuerently ministred by the Archbishop. Thirdly, Bishop Iewell was See p. 137. Consecrated the 21. of Ianuary following, by Matthew Archbishop of Canterbury, Edmund London, Richard Ely and Iohn Bedford, in the foresaid Chappel at Lambehith vpon the Sabboth in the forenoone, with Common praiers, Communion, and a Sermon, preached by Master Andrew Peirson, the Archbishops Chaplaine, vpon this Text, Math. 5. 16. 
               Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heauen. Lastly, Bishop Pag. 134. 
               Horne, was Consecrated the yeere following by Mathew Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bishop of Saint Dauids, Edmund Bishop of London, and Thomas Bishop of Cou
                     •
                  ntry and Lichfield, as was before related. The place of his Consecration was likewise the Chappell at Lambehith: the time, the Sabbath day in the fore-noone: and the maner in all respects as the former. Thus all things were most orderly and reuerently performed. Now let the world iudge, what is to bee thought of these men, which dare so confidently blaze such vntruthes, and are not ashamed to produce an eye witnesse for that which was neuer seene by the eye of man. As for their downe Pigge, and vp Pike, and such other of the same stampe, I may say with the Prophet, Esay 57. 4. 
               On whomhaue you iested, vpon whom haue you gaped and thrust out the tongue? And I aduise you to remember the saying of Salomon, 
               Eccles. 7. 8. 
               As the noise or crackling of the thornes vnder the pot: so is the laughter of a foole: As also that of Dauid, 
               Psal. 1. 1. 
               Blessed is the man that hath not sit in the seat of the scornefull. I will conclude this point with this saying of Salomon, 
               Pro. 12. 22. 
               The lying lips are an abomination to the Lord; but they that deale truely are his delight.
