Wherfore I haue put myselfe to translate this presente booke called the grete shyppe of fooles out of Frensshe in to Englysshe / bycause that this booke hathe ben fyrste made in Allemayne language / and out of Allemayne it was translated into latyn by mayster Jaques Locher / and oute of latyn in to rethoryke Frensshe. I haue consydered that the one delyteth them in latyn / ye other in Frensshe / some in ryme / and the other in prose / for the whiche cause I haue done this / more ouer consyderynge this that Therence Therentius. sayth.

And to the ende that they may eschewe al mondanytes and folyes / I praye them that they haue regarde vnto this present booke / and that they comprehende the substaunce / to ye ende that they maye wysely gouerne them selfe in the tyme to come / and that thorugh theyr labour they may be of the nombre of ye saued. For whan a man debateth / the shame that it be not vaynquysshed multe plyeth his force. And the good conscyence also multeply eth vertues in man. Consyderynge also that the prose is more famylyer vnto euery man than ye ryme. I Henry Uirgilius. Watson indygne and symple of vnderstondynge / haue reduced this present boke in to our maternall tongue of Englysshe out of Frensh / at the request of my worshyp full mayster wynkyn de worde / thrughe the entysement & exhortacyon of ye excellent pryncesse Margarete / coū

You lectours humbly I requyre you for to pardon me yf that I haue erred in ony thynge / for ye tendernes of my yeres hathe so affusked me that I haue not applyed me vnto the lettres as Jought to haue done / the language is not autentyke / to the ende that euerybody may vnderstonde some thynge / for folkes vn lyttered demaundeth not thynges obscure.
         
         
            ¶ Prolude of this present boke.
            
               NOwe is the worlde ful of scyence and documentes made by our aūcyent faders / in suche wyse that the holy scrypture is in gretter vygoure than euer it was / for in her is all ryght. Fyrst we haue the holy byble of ye aūcyent faders. In ye whiche appereth euydently theyr feates and lyues / we maye take good ensamples for to susteyne and nourysshe our poore soules. For he that loueth not vertues is reputed vyle. More ouer we haue ye bookes of phylosophye wherin is conteyned all goodnes it is they wherin all the wyse men dyd lerne / she is excellente and of grete pryse. And who that delyteth in her may haue ryght grete prouffyte. But this notwithstondynge I meruayle me of euery mortall man / bycause yt they thynke not vpon theyr salute / and thynke soner to assemble a grete sorte of synnes / and how that god consumeth

vs not / seynge yt we offende hȳ soo moche. Good doctryne is chaced out of the worlde euery daye / and in folye and imbelycyte man passeth his dayes / he fleeth & leueth good doctryne. Palas was wonte to kepe the ren Pal

                  s. ges in this worlde / but by our grete and enorme synnes we maye not suffre it. She is in heuen where as she serueth the sayntes of whome she is loue. None or ryght fewe haue her prudence / scyence / or doctryne / we haue not the ouerture of probyte / fayth / conscience / loue / and pyte is not in vs / but echone dysprayseth his god / wher fore he yt taketh vertues / cheseth a good place. Noneste thynges and good condycyons we dysprayse. The holy sayntes documentes and admonestinges we dyspyse wt the celestyall doctrynes so dulcet and amerous vnto the good and dyscrete men of this worlde. ¶ More ouer we fall in infynyte errours that in the worlde is the worste and are releued in a myscheuous empyre / by our synnes are infynyte / and none of vs hathe a stedfaste degree. By playnes / wayes / pathes / tauernes / markettes / stretes / mountaynes / hylles / felde s / and fynably by al quarters is excercysed glotonye whiche is so vyle / in takyng inutyle wayes / and not the waye of salute. We folowe capons / tauernes / etynge & drynkynge insacyably / we replenysshe our bodyes vnmesurably with lecherye and delycates / sobrenes is not foūde in vs / euery body is trobled with this vyce. Our hertes is affusked so that it demaundeth nothynge but vanytees / our soules we fulfyl with fylthes and lecheryes in lyke wyse / and of othervyces mo than a hondred. By the meanes wherof there is grete haboundaunce of fooles thorugh the worlde / in suche wyse that in dyuers regyons and countrees theyr folyes redoundeth / so moche that all vertues & pure thynges

Suche folkes ought not to be byleued that are so ouer wenynge and vnknowynge / for oftentymes they are taken for good and is al replete with vaynglorye / of good wyt they are voyde and yet they repute themselfe prudent and wyse. Now then the good and loyall shall haue theyr deserte and hyre. And fooles peruers shall be vnwryten. Wherfore I wyll gyue euery body good loos after my possybylyte and the deserte of echone. By my fyccyons I shall dresse vpon ye se shyppes and barges / and shall furnysshe theym with cordes and toppe castelles verges and sayl

The last of these rennynge fooles wyll be aboue the other / and wyll drawe vp the sayll on lofte / to the ende that it may entre more in to the see. If that you wyll knowe what is this shyppe / knowe that eche of vs hath a shyppe / but yet there is one the whiche is comune / and all fooles / that hathe dyuers hunes and toppes / & goche in to dyuers countrees / the whiche is replete with many sortes of fooles. O you reygnynge that haue fayre faces / myrre you here and red? this present booke / for there is not an humayne but that he maye se his fourme in this booke. If that you entende totally vnto my doctry nes / be you well sure that you maye acquyre the glorye eternel / and eschewe the pardurable paynes of helle / for you shall haue fruyte of vertues & benedyccyon of god. folye shall not go and fetche you / and our shyppe ye wol de not seke / but ye may acquyre the glorye pardurable / you shal go the waye that all the crysten men watche / & shal acquyre vertues and holynes / puttynge all euyl vy ces oute of you. Consyder humayne folkes and mortall men the feates and the desyres mondaynes / and ye shal knowe that the moost strongest / the moost wysest / & the moost valyauntest go rennynge more swyfter than the hynde / and theyr trace is not knowen. Alas oure lyues passeth ryght sone. He that is poore and hathe nothynge is holden for a foole / that parauenture is without sȳne / Alas he is more wyser than they yt haue moche goodes / and be in the subgeccyon of the deuyll. And he is holden for ryght wyse that hathe haboundaunce of goodes / & he is so replete with synne that it is a thynge inestymable

/ ye so moche that thrugh his offence he is casten in to the fyre of helle / wyse is he not but a parfyte foole. The poore that is reputed for a foole at his aste ende loketh to be partycypar of the goodes of dame palas. They yt loue vertues without doynge outrage to ony body / god shall loue them without ony faute / so that he bere not a folysshe mytre / and yf he were of scyence vnpuruayed / So that he be replete with vertue / he shall be more wyser than a grete clerke. ¶ I fynde assembles of fooles by grete hepes and routes of dyuers nacyons and maners for the one is vnbraynles that wyll bere baners. The other is of fyers thoughtes the whiche dothe not enploye them but alonely to assemble rychesses. And bryefly for to knowe whiche is the fooles I shall name theym here vnto you. Nobles / clerkes / preestes / monkes / apostates burgeyses / marchauntes / ryche / poore / & of all craftes / is our shyppe almoost full. There is neyther rustyke / olde / yonge / berdles / stronge / feble / grete / nor lytell haue they neuer so moche scyence. yf they be fooles they haue no respyte but that they come hastely in to our shyppe / Not alonely the men / but also the women / ladyes / gentylwomen / burgeyses / olde and yonge / dronkerdes / & sobre / pudykes / chaste / wedowes / and maryed women be in our shyppes with the men / for in dyuers thynges me ueth dyuers folkes / and pryncypally in voluptuous loue / in suche wyse that they leue all good operacyons for to lyue in carnall felycyte and lubryke lyfe. Mondayne fooles myrre you well in my glasse / and you shal se your fautes and synnes. And shall knowe euydently how foly dothe gouerne you. Knowe that our entencion preten deth to none other thynge saue that we may make satysfaccyon vnto god / to the ende that we be full of vertues

for to leue our shyppe and mast / & our importable dyscorde / leue synne / and go out of the myre / for it is yt whiche putteth the soule to dethe / do it sone and I shal be of youre accorde. If that some fooles mocke vs bycause of our lytell wrytynges / and that there is comprehended dyuers fooles in it / they haue small vnderstondynges / for the sens lytterall is not the substaunce of the mater. Suche folkes is lyke them that thynke for to ete the almondes kyrnelles withoute brekynge of the stones / for who that wyll fynde sauour therin muste breke it / also who wyll fynde prouffyte in this booke / oughte to reste hym on the moral sens that is couered with foly. My boke satyryke I gyue vnto you for example. Lordes yf it please you for to rede it / & yf it seme you yt it is mordaunt excuse me as the auncyentes are excused / the whiche haue made dyuers fayre doctrynes mordauntes. The poetes haue also compyled dyuers noble bookes correckynge the vyces of the humaynes. ¶ All this consydered I wyll folowe them / notwithstondynge yt I am not worthy. But yet in maner of passe tyme I wyll speke here of fooles men and women / and assygne them guaryson of vertues / scyence / & doctryne / for to make them condyscende vnto goodnes. For I had neuer other wyll but for to detraye yonge bachelers out of synnes and vyces / & to conduyte them vnto the porte of reason and vertue / Pardon me you oratours yf ony thȳge be euyll couched and you lectours that occupyeth the tyme in this lecture yf you fynde ony faute / please it you to excuse the capacyte of me / & the yongthe that I am yet in / consyderȳge that there is none so well shodde but that they may slyde somtyme.

Theyr doublettes is garded endlong and ouerth warte bordred wt veluet or wt sylke. Clokes bended with dyuers colours. There is dyuers clothes worne at this present tyme / the gownes haue double rebraced colers. Theyr shertes ben fronced with golde or sylke / ye & that is of the fynest clothe yt can be founden.

The grete shone rounde as a boule / and after them the squared / buskynges all to cut slyppers bygared / the hosen garded and bended with veluet or satyn / the purses as sachelles / with gyrdylles of taffeta. What lacketh there more (nothynge) saue the fayre swerde or hanger by theyr syde. O crystendome crystendome / yf thou haue mortalytes and epydemees thou arte the cause therof. I saye and notefye to the / yt yu haste endured that suche habytes haue ben worne / & that worse is / is yet worne. Thou shalt haue yet dyuers punycyons / yf in shorte tyme thou remedy it not. Cast awaye these newe guyses and customes / aswel men as women: for they be vyle and dyshonest.

Uenus that is ye conductour of cupydo holdeth all louers in her bondes.

He is a foole that dystempereth hymselfe / and putteth hym in the waye of lamentacyons / of dystresse / of myse ryes / and of dolours / and submytteth them in ye seruyce of this lady. O how many excellent cytees hathe venus destroyed and brought to nought by her concupyscence. She hathe caused & empesshed many folke from theyr prosperyte and welfare. We rede of full many aūcyent men and women that hathe ben wounded by her of the darte of her swete sone Cupydo. By her ben happened many euylles. The Troyens hathe ben poore and dolorous by her exhortacyon / and theyr noble cyte that was soo strongly fortefyed with walles & dytches dystroyed and brente. The septre of kynge Pryam that was soo tryumphaunt was casten downe / and all for the luxury of the fayre Parys yt rauysshed Helayne. O harde morsure that for pleasure mondayne suffred suche ruyne & destruccyon. Was it not grete pyte that soo noble a cyte was destroyed for suche a cause. Also after that Marcꝰ Anthonyus had vaynquysshed the Persyens and that Marcus anthonius. he had borne awaye the pryce / as he retorned he was ra uysshed in the loue of Cleopatra / that promysed hym ye 
               Cleopatra. empyre of Rome / the whiche made his men for to arme them / and made prepayre two hondred shyppes garnysshed with arowes and dartes for to conquere the empyre of Rome. But Cezar made for to enquere of the folys she purpose of this louer. And dyscomfyted hym and all his men / wherthrugh he vndyde hymselfe in the cyte of Alexandre bycause yt they wolde not take hym to mercy. ¶ And within a lytell whyle after Cleopatra in gretelamentacyons and sorowes made herself to be transported vnto the cyte of Alexandre besyde her louer marcus Anthonyus by two serpentes yt she put to her pappes

/ and there shedde her bloode excessyuely without ye conforte of ony body / and deyed besyde her louer. If the se two louers had maynteyned and contynued in chasty te they hadde not deyed so myserably. He that applyeth his tyme in loue hathe no reason / he is without lawe / & all euyll redoundeth vnto hym.

And after yt he was deed she confessed that they had put hym wrong fully to deth. And then for veray poore sorowe and dysconforte she strangled herselfe pyteously. We rede also of Pasyphyle that by ardaunt concupyscence had a doo Pasipha. Dedalus. minotaurus.
