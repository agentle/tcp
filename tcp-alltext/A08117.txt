                     Princes did there imbrace:
                     And in my heart I long to be
                     within that ioyfull place.
                     The more I gaz'd, the more I might,
                     the sight pleas'd me so well:
                     For what I saw in euery thing,
                     my tongue can no way tell:
                     Then of the man I did demand,
                     what place the same might be:
                     Whereas so many Kings doe dwell,
                     in ioy and melody?
                     Quoth he, that blessed place is heauen,
                     where yet thou must not rest,
                     And those that do like Princes walke,
                     are men whom God hath blest.
                     Then did I turne me round about,
                     and on the other side,
                     He bade me view and marke as much,
                     what things are to be spide.
                     With that I saw a coale blacke den,

                        and with soot and smoake

                     which made me like to choake.

                     About his necke were fiery ruffes,

                     I askt, and loe, the young-man said,
                     that he was damn'd for pride.
                     Another sort then did I see,
                     whose bowel; Uipers tore:
                     And grieuously with gaping mouth,
                     they did both yell and roare.
                     A spotted person by each one
                     stood gnawing on their hearts:
                     And this was conscience I was told,
                     that plagu'd their enuious parts.
                     These were no sooner out of sight,
                     but straight came in their place,
                     A sort still throwing burning fire,
                     which fell against their face.
                     And ladles full of melted gold,
                     were powred downe their throats:
                     And these were set (as séem'd to me)
                     in midst of burning boats:
                     The for most of the company,

                     his Lord and Master sold.
                     For couetousnes those were condemn'd

                     was made their finest fare.
                     From armes, from hands, from thighes & feet,

                     And vnderneath them burning brands,

                     With brimstone fierce their Pillows,
                     whereon their heads were laid,
                     And fiends with whips of glowing fire eke,
                     their lecherous skins off flaid.
                     Then did I see another come,
                     stebb'd in with daggers thicke:
                     And filthy fiends with fiery darts,
                     their hearts did wound and pricke:
                     And mighty bowls of corrupt blood,
                     were brought them for to drinke,

                     was still the oath they made.
                     And therewithall from vgly Hell,
                     such shriekes and cryes I heard,
                     As though some greater griefe and plague
                     had vext them afterward.
                     So that my soule was sore afraid,
                     such terrour on me fell:
                     Away then went the yong-man quite,
                     and bade me not farewell.
                     Wherefore vnto my body straight,
                     my spirit return'd againe,
                     And liuely blood did afterward
                     stretch forth in euery veine.
                     My closed eyes I opened,
                     and raised from my sound:
                     And wondred much to see my self

                     Which when my neighbors did behold,
                     great feare vpon them fell.
