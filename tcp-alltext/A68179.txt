            The firſt chapter is concerning the head and his partes.
            
               For fallinge of the heyre of the head.
               
                  MAke lye of the aſhes burnt of doues dounge / and waſhe the heade therewyth.
                     Fallynge of heyre.
                   But if ye can not get doues dounge / take leaues of oken tre / and ſeth the middelmoſt rippes of them in water / & waſh the head oft there wt / letting it dry by it ſelfe / yt helpeth very well.
               Or els take the aſhes burnt of litle frogges / make a lye therwyth / waſh the head oft therewyth / that hindreth the falling of the heyre.
               But for ye drye ſkaldes of it / called in Latin Furfur / Porrigo or Pityra / ſeth the rotes of Malowes in water / & waſh ye head oft therwith / and they ſhall fall of.
                     Drye ſkaldes. Scelfferinge of the head.
                   He yt hath a ſcalfering head / let theſame take ye courſe brāme or wheat / & caſt ſething hote water vpon thē / let thē ſtand one day & night: after yt let it be ſtrayned through a cloth / & put a litle vinegre thereto / & ſtrake it vpon the head / & moyſtē it oft therwt / yt doth driue the ſcelfering away.
               If one hath a head that can not be healed / let him take thick creme / 
                     Vncurable ſores
                   and anoynte the head therewith well in the euening and morning thre wekes continually / but let the head be firſt wel and bare ſhauen / yt the creme maye the better pearſe in / waſhe the head euery thyrde daye wyth ſtrong warme lye / that the head may be chaſed therwyth: at the laſt renſch the head with colde lye / theſame draweth the heate out of it / after that let it drye / & anoint it agayn as before. Of thys wyſe mayeſt thou heale & clenſe a head / though it were harde cruſted with corruption.
               But if any hath had vnclene ſcurfes or ſcabbes vpon the head / & is healed of thē / howbeit it pilleth as though it wold break vp agayn / let him ſtrake or anoynt it with oyle of flaxe ſede or lyne ſede / let him frot the heade ſore therewyth: theſame maketh the ſkin ſtronge / harde and alſo cleane / that it breake vp no more.
            
            
               For lyſe and nittes.
               TAke the heades of herbe Gitt or Nigella / and burne them to aſhes / put ſwynes greſe thereto / and ſtrake or kemme the heyres therewyth / that dryueth awaye lyſe and nittes.
                     For lyſe and nittes.
                  
               
               Or els bye quickſiluer for a penny / and ſlake it with faſtinge ſpatle / put thereto half an vnce of ſwines greſe or butter / anoynte therewyth a kamb / and kembe thy head therewyth / theſame driueth awaye and killeth all the nittes. But if it is in ſummer or harueſt / that thou mayeſt haue the rootes of wilde ſaffron / take the iuyce of them: wher theſame is ſtraked / ther ſlayeth and driueth it away the liſte / and alſo liſe of the priuy membres.
               Or els take a litle pece of the clothe that goldſmythes waſhe the gylted veſſels wyth / and ſtrake the place therewyth where they are / and they do fall of: and thys cloth mayeſt thou vſe to twenty men / and it maye be kepte yearly and dayly / and remayneth good to vſe / ſpecially for ouerbrowes and

eye liddes / wherein the ſame vermin called the life of priuye membres do growe / and maye be vſed without daunger.
                     Life of priuye mēbres.
                  
               
               For the life of the head / take a penny worth of lorel or baye berries / bray thē to pouder / lye thē in a linnen cloth / ſeth theſame in running water / and waſh the head there with. Theſame vertue hath alſo the roote of Bearfote beaten to pouder.
            
            
               Of payne in the head.
               
                  
                     Of payn in the heade.
                  THe payn of the head cōmeth ſomtime of his oune diſeaſe / ſomtime of other mēbres / as of the ſtomake: ſomtime of outward accidentes / as of beating / falling or ſunheat: ſomtime of wounding / ſomtime of colde: ſōtyme of heat / ſomtime of ſuperfluitie of blood / ſomtime cā it not be ſayde by what occaſion / ſomtime cōmeth ye ſicknes or diſeas by it ſelfe / & theſame laſteth cō
                  tinually. But moſt chefely cometh it by ye vpbraything of ye ſtomak into the head: to heal this / is neceſſary to know of what complexion the diſeaſe is / yt thou mayſt purge & clēſe it therafter. If thou wilt than help him / take hede of what complexion ye diſeaſe is.
                     Tokēs of headake cauſed of bloode.
                   If it cometh of ye blood / the ſame is hote & moyſt / yt ſhalt thou know therby / if the payne is moſt in ye forpart of ye head / & then are thoſe veynes read yt are by the eyes / the face rede and hote / ye veynes vnder the eyes are pale / the veynes of the tēples beate fearcely / ye veyne of the puls beateth faſt and ſore / and is great / his vrine is reade and thicke / hys bodye louſe. Theſe are the euident tokens of the blood.
               
                  
                     Tokēs of headake cauſed of Cholera.
                  If the headake cometh of Colera / that is / of hote and drye complexion / yt ſhalt thou know therby: The noſe is hote and aketh for heate / the tounge is great and drye / he is thyrſty / and can ſlepe but litle: and when he ſlepeth / he fighteth & is vnquiet / the veyne of his pulſe is litle and feble / & feleth ye grefe moſt in the right ſide. Theſame nedeth not to blow his noſe / for nothing iſſueth out of it / by reaſon of the great heate.
               
                  
                     Tokēs of headake cauſed of Flegma.
                  If the headake commeth of flegma / that is / of colde and moyſt complexion or nature / the ſame hath greater grefe in the hindermoſt part of ye head then the for part / and can ſlepe better: he is heuy in all his members / he is litle thyrſty / the veynes of his pulſe are greate and feble.
               
                  
                     Tokēs of headake cauſed of Melancoly.
                  But if ye headake cometh of Melācoly / thē hath he ye moſt grefe in ye left ſyde of the head. Galen ſayth: the head is diuided into foure partes: In the fore parte hath blood the dominion / Colera in the right ſyde / Melācoly in the left ſyde / & flegma beareth rule in the hindermoſt part.
               
                  
                     Headake of blood
                  If the headake cometh of blood / then let him blood in ye head veyne called Cephalica / in ye hand by the thumbe / or els in the forhead. Take hede alſo lefſt his age of youth (wherby he might be to feble) hinder the: or els ye tyme: the ſame muſt be kept wyth dietynge / as I ſhall teache hereafter.
               
                  
                     Headake of Colera.
                  If the headake cometh of Colera / theſame muſt be let blood at the lyuer veyne / and geue him to eate prunes of Damaſke / and ſoure cheries though they be dryed / take oyle of roſes or violettes / put thereto as much vinegre / anoynte his head therwyth wher it greueth or aketh / dip two hēpē clothes therin / & let him hold thē in his hand / ye ſame draweth out ye euil heat: but if ye can not haue the oyle of roſes / take the whyte of egges / roſe water and

vinegre / and do thus: Set his fete in hote water / and rub his legges well dounwarde: and if he will not haue thē waſhed / then let him dyppe the fete in colde water / and lay him doune to reſt / and not ſlepe by day time / but beware for heate and wyne. Howbeit if he will drincke wyne / let it be ſoure / and wel mixt / let him alſo drinke water ſodden wyth barlye / theſame doth coole him / & let him take otherwhyles ſugar candy into his mouth / to ſlake the thyrſt / or els agayne cōfect of cheries or prunes. But he muſt beware of ſalt meates and fleſh / without it were of chycken / or els let him eat ſoure vnrype grapes / or els the iuyce of them / or ſorel. Let him vſe a litle vinegre in his meat / but no ſpice nor ought yt chafeth: & take hede he be loſe in ye bellye. If nede conſtrayne the / take Venice ſope or alume / make pilles of it / & vſe it for a ſuppoſitory.

                   But if ye haue ye rootes of betes / ſtrake thē a litle wt ſalte / & put them vp into the fundament / or els ſeth hony till it be black in an earthē v

If ye haue not hony / take the iolke of an egge / & as muche ſalt / ſeth theſame together / and make pillets thereof / the bigneſſe of a haſelnut or filberte / and put that into the bodye / theſame retayneth the ſege. If it is a man / let him beware of women / for they are hurtfull for him / alſo of moſtarde / garleke / onyons / lekes and ſuche lyke.
                     Superfluity of blood. To make the noſe to bleth.
                   If the headake cōmeth of ſuperfluity of blood / then make him thus to bleth at the noſe without ſmarte: Take ſedes of red nettels / and braye them to pouder in a morter / blow a littel of the ſame pouder into his noſe with a quill. But if ye can not get ſedes of nettels / put a hole of the herbe called Milleſoyl or Yarbe into the noſe / and rubbe ye noſe outwardly ſoftly / and then ſhal it bleth. But if it be in winter / and canſt get nether Chyrurgeon to let blood / nor nettels / nor nettels ſede / nor yet no millefoyle / and wouldeſt gladly drawe the blood from the head / then take two ſack bandes / and binde or tye them firſt about the legges aboue the knye / & let it ſo abyde the ſpace of halfe a Pater noſter: then loſe it agayne / and tye it agayne. Do this the ſpace of a quarter of an houre: than tye his armes aboue the elbowe lykewyſe / thus ſhalt thou drawe al the blood from ye head. But ye muſt handle thys thing warelye / leſte ye let the m

                  nbre to longe to be tyed / whereby the membre might be aſconnyed or choked.
               But if the heade burne to ſore / take the iuyce of Porceleyne / and ſtrake the head and tempels therewyth / or where the moſt heate is.
                     Heate in the head
                  
               
               If the heade doth ake ſo ſore / (by reaſon of a morre or runninge) that he can not ſnoffe hys noſe / than were it good to vſe confectes made of the apothecaries / called Naſalia / and put them thereinto / or els Margerim wrethen together / and put into the noſe / for the ſame draweth out all euell humors.
                     Headake of a mor.
                   If ye can not haue the ſame nother / thē take a grene rote of betes / as longe as a finger and a halfe / ſharped a litle and bruſed / put theſame into the noſe and let it abide the ſpace of a quarter of an hour / theſame draweth out alſo all euell humors.
               But if ye can not haue theſame nother / than take the ſede of Cokle / that is founde in the corne / beate it to pouder / put the ſame into the noyſe / that draweth ſore. Or els take a pot / and put rapes into it / and ſeth them / than holde thy noſe ouer it / that the vapor or hote breth aſcende ſo into thy head / that thou do euen ſweat with it.
               
                  Or take water creſſes dryed / not in the ſunne / but in the ayer / braye the ſame to pouder in a morter / or within your handes / ſyft it through a lynnen cloth. Howbeit if it would be to long to drye it in the ayer / then drye it in an ouen / when the bread is drawen / or els in a ſtoue or hote houſe.
               
                  
                     Headake of Melancoly.
                  But if one hath payne in the head of Melancoly / his diſeaſe is come by colde / and of drye complexion. Dicte theſame and gyue him to eat meates yt are hote and moyſt / to chafe hys nature and moyſt hys body. If he haue no ſieges / then geue him the fourth part of an vnce or iij. drames of Diacartha mi / before daye breake / and let him walke vp and doune / vntill he get a ſiege. But when the ſiege is done / then gyue hym ſome thynge to comfort him or that may reſtore hys ſtrength / as ſuppinge or broth of chekins / or younge beafe / and mixe ſomtime a litle beaten ſaffron in hys meate. After that may ye geue him a fewe pigges fete / for the ſame make hys veynes tender and moyſt / & geue him ſomtyme in the morning or daye tyme milke to drincke / yt is ſodden with egges: that ſtrengtheneth hym / and geueth nature force. Alſo oughte he to bath ſomtime a litle in a bath made with Fenel or Heyſede / gathered vpon a heye loft / & otes ſtraw: but ye may not bath to long nor to hote. If in bathing the ſweat will not in ſhort ſpace iſſue / thē go out: for thē is not the bath good for thy / & kepe thy ſelfe warm after it / leſt thou do take colde vpon it / & beware of all meates that may coole & dry the / as muſtard / garleke / onyons / lekes / alſo of harde or olde cheſe / Martinmaſſe beafe / Haringe / read haringe / Lynge and ſuche lyke.
               
                  
                     Headake of flegma.
                  But if the headake commeth of flegma / namely of cold and ſuperfluous moyſture / then is it neceſſary to purge the heade wyth pilles Cochie / and pilles De iera. Beware of ſuche thinges as coole / and bringe corrupte moiſture / as fruyte / water / fleſhe / freſh cheſe / new bread / and all that is of euel digeſtion. His temples ought to be anoynted wyth oyl of Camomille. But if thou haſt not oyle of Camomill / then take two egges ſhelles full of floures of Camomil / greue or ſeere / and ſeth them in wine and water together / and when it is ſodden to the halfe / then ſtrayne it through a cloth / and put therto butter / ſo much as a gouſe egge / and then boyle the water and wyne awaye: Bath his fete alſo in a depe tob / euen vntill the knees / that the hote breth maye thorou warme his body / & he may ſweat. Into this water put two handfulles of floures of Camomille / and a handful of heyſede well ſodden. If he do ſweat well / laye hym to ſlepe / & couer him warme: if he coulde ſweat in the bed / that ſhould do hym good / then gyue hym a litle grene ginger / and a litle coriander ſtiped a night longe in vinegre and dryed agayne / theſame doth chafe his head and ſtomack / and conſumeth the euel humors / that riſe out of the ſtomack into the head / and trouble the braynes / that ſame doth it ſwage. Geue him alſo in the morninge faſtinge / if he can bear it / and let him faſt two houres there vpon: Take thre quarters of an vnce of aqua vite / a peny weyght of beaten ſaffron / and a peny weyghte of beaten Cinamon / half an vnce of Bugloſſen or Oxetunge water / mixe theſe together / let them ſtand a day and night / then ſhall it be tempered the one with the other. Thys doth warme hys ſtomack / riſeth into hys head / dryeth hys moyſt braynes / wherof his diſeaſe commeth in the heade. Let him eat meates of good digeſtion / and not to muche at ones:
                     Nota.
                   for ſo longe the ſtomack is

colde and moyſt can it not digeſt wel / and if he eate much / therof waxeth it full of ſlyme and filth / and many diſeaſes growe of it / as payne in the head / greuous couginges / agues / gripinges in the belly / wormes / payne in ye mother or matrice / and many other: and if the payne lieth in the heade / then let him be bathed / ſpecially wyth theſe herbes: Take of Valeriane and Fenell of eche a hand full / Ootes ſtraw two handfull / a peck of Ootes / but if thou haſt no Ootes / take the ſtraw only / Heyſede / of euerye one iij. handfull / put theſame into a litle ſack / and ſeth it in a kettel wyth water / bath therwith / and when he is thorow warm and ſweateth / then renſch hym wyth louke or bloode warm water / and caſt a cloth or twayne ouer hym for coolinge / laye hym doune / couer hys body and head warme / that he may alſo ſweate in the bed: afterwarde take ſome of the coueringe awaye / let him ſlepe a litle in the bedde / and after that geue him a good broth of a pollet or chycken / or els a ſupping of yong beafe or veele that is not ouerfat / or els the broth of graye peaſen / with beaten ſaffron the bignes of a peaſe: but he maye nether eat nor drink to much / & then reſt a litle. If he can / let him ſweat a litle after it / & be alway ſtill / both in the bath and alſo bed / as he is in the heat or ſweating / leſt he become to fel. The head waſhen wyth lye / wherin are ſodden ye floures of Camomil / taketh away the euill humors of the head and braines yt are gathered ther in with cold: theſame doth alſo the water where in floures of Camomil are ſoddē / & put vpon the head.
                     Headake of ſtoppinge.
                   But if ye head did thus ake / by reaſon of a conſtipacion or ſtopping / ſo yt ye could not wel take breth / thē bye halfe an vnce of Cinomon vnbeaten / and eate oft a litle thereof / or els take a pece of bread / ſtipe it in wine / and ſtrowe Cinamon beaten vpon it / eate the ſame / that taketh awaye the ſtoppinge / miniſheth the ſlyme / of the whych the ſtoppinge is engendred.
               This medicin doth alſo miniſh greatly / and taketh awaye the payne in the head: Take a pint of wine / warme theſame / then take four yolkes of egges / beate theſame in the wine / and moyſten hys head well therewith: theſame draweth out the heat / and alayeth the payne.
               But if the head ake were come of cold ayer or windes / 
                     Headake of cold
                           •
                         ayer.
                   thē waſh ye head with water / wherin are ſodden ye floures & herle of Camomil / after yt ſtrake ye forhead / tēples & ſtomak wyth ye foreſayd oyle or butter / or els ſtipe ſoft clothes therin / & lay thē into the neck / the ſame draweth out the euil moyſtnes & cold / & warmeth ye head. Water diſtilled of Betony / & a cloth dipped there in / & preſſed wel out agayne / and then wrapped or tyed hard about ye head / reſtoreth the head that was diſtempered wyth cold moyſture (euen yt ſome fall into frenſy) ryght well to his former eſtate. But if thou canſt not get the water / but canſt haue the herbe / then ſeth the ſame in wyne / mixt wyth the third deal water / and vſe the ſame in ſtede of the diſtilled water.
            
            
               A wounderfull experience for the headacke.
               SEt a diſh or platter of tynne vpon the bare head filled with water / putte an vnce and an halfe / or two vnces of molten leade therein / whyle he hath it vpon the head. Or els make a garlande of Veruayne / and wear it daye and night / that helpeth wounderfully.
               
                  Lykewyſe mayeſt thou take two hand full of Veruayn / theſame mayſt thou chappe ſmall / & ſeth them in a quart of wine / put thē into a littel ſack / & laye them hote vpon the heade / twiſe or iij. tymes / that healeth well.
            
            
               A ſlouggiſh or ſlepery diſeaſe.
               
                  
                     A ſlepery diſeaſe.
                  THys diſeaſe commeth gladly and lightely of colde & much moyſtneſſe / ſpecially to a good folke / becauſe their naturall heate is gone. This diſeaſe is thus knowen: they haue alway great heat / whereof the cauſe is an impoſtumacion / yt lieth in the head behinde / and his vrine is pale and thick. By reaſon of yt diſeaſe & ye trublinge of his head & braynes / he lieth or ſitteth / makinge ſemblance as though he dyd ſlepe / and yet doth not: he wendeth & waltereth / & happely his head & fete do mete together: theſame muſt be healed of thys wiſe: Bye a litle nyſing pouder / or els take the ſede of ye Nigella that is founde in the corne feldes / beate and vſe them in ſtede of the nyſinge pouder / or els vſe the floures of muſtarde ſede / or take beaten Mergerun gentle / put any of theſe into hys noyſe oft tymes / and cauſe him oft to nyſe. Rubbe alſo the ſoles of his fete oft wyth warme water / vinegre & ſalt / with a wollen cloth / the palme of his handes alſo / and kepe his belly louſe wyth ſuppoſitories of alum / or other / as I haue taught before / and let him be layd in a place where much light is: let alſo much communication be had wyth hym / to hinder him of his ſlepe / and kepe him from ſlepinge. But if he hath great heate / then maye he be bathed in a bath / that the vncleane heat and moyſtneſſe maye auoyde from him / and anoynte hys heade wyth water / wherein are ſodden Camomille / Anis and Wormwood.

Beſydes thys are many men / that by nature haue a feble head and braynes / though they are no great drinkes / and therfore doth the drinke runne ſone into theyr heades. This alſo happeneth diuerſe wayes: Firſt / becauſe the drinkes are to ſtronge for them.

place and much noyſe / whych they are not accoſtumed / wyth that doth the drinke ſwetely ouercomme them / etc.

               The coughe and the cauſes thereof.¶For the cough.
            MAnye wayes getteth a man the cough: ſomtyme of the breſtes miſtemperinge / ſomtyme of a matter that is inward or outwarde of the body.

If it be wythin / as it happeneth oft / that an humor falleth oute of the head into the breſt / theſame is the worſt to be healed.
                  An humor in the breſt
               
            
            If the cough commeth of heat / then is the brine rede / and this throte is drye and rough. To ſuche one ought be geuen barly potage wyth butter to be eaten / and Ptiſana or Barly water to be droncken / wher
                  •
               in Lycoris is ſodden. Geue him alſo to eat potage made wyth Lettis chapped and ſodden in water / and after that well fryed in butter / thys taketh awaye he cough wythout payne.
            The cough that is engendred by colde / is knowen by the whyteneſſe of the brine.
            He that hath a feruent cough / let him take Neppe / that cattes delite in / ſo much as a Walnut / let him cut it ſmal and ſtampe it / and ma
                  •
               e a taunſey thereof / wyth two egges beaten therein: let him eat this / and it ſhall make him whole. Thys taunſey maye he eate when he will / and is ſpecially good for hym that hath a cough / cauſed of colde.
            Or els vſe thys medicine: take wyne and oyle of oliue in like quantitye / put theſame into a cruyſe / and ſeth it a litle / ſtere it together / and geue hym that to drinke / when he will go to bed / and in the morninge / ſo warm as he can ſuffer it: do thys two dayes one after another / and thys breaketh the running or morres / and ſofteneth the cough wythout hurte. It is alſo good for horſeneſſe / cauſed of colde.
            The cough doth alſo ouertake a man by reaſon of an euell humor engendred in the liuer or the lightes / and ſo do fall into the breſt:
                  An humor in the liuer
                the ſame muſt be holpen of this wyſe as ſhall folowe.
            Somtyme is the cough cauſed by foren or outwarde occaſſions as are ſmoke / euill vapors / ſtinking ayres / duſt / colde drinkes / or of drinkinge cold when a man is chafed / or els when he drincketh / it falleth into the wronge throte.
                  Outvvar de occaſions.
               
            
            The drye cough commeth ſomtyme / that ye patient hath an vnclene pulmen or lightes & throte / & of fylthy matter / yt is aſſembled about ye pulmon & the griſtels of ye pulmon in the cheſte / & is waxē tough:
                  Drye cough.
                wherby it cōmeth / yt a man can not caſt it out / & getteth ſomtime a deadly apoſteme. When it is now growē to an apoſteme / then helpe him with ſyropes / as I ſhall teache you here after to mollifye it. Take alſo diligent hede whence the apoſtemacion commeth / yt therafter ye maye know how to cure him / and let this folowyng be the general cure.
            Take a whit cloth / wet ye ſame in cold water / & ſtrayn it wel out again: thā winde it wel about yt patiētes throte.
                  Cure generall of apoſtems in the breſte.
                After yt take another warm cloth / & wind alſo threfold about ye throte: thys do in ye morning / middaye / & at night / & geue him thys ſyrop: Take a diſhfull of brayded or beatē barlye / foure vnces of reſ

Drinke of this when ye wil / ſpecially in ye morning & euen to bedward. Thys moll fieth very wel / & cauſeth to caſt out / & maketh large about the breſt: alſo doth it heal ye ſoreneſſe & roughneſſe of the throte. If it waxeth thicke / then put more water to it.
         
         
            
            ¶A drinke for the cough / for thyrſte and roughneſſe of the throte.
            TAke a quarte of water / put an vnce of ſuger therein / and ſeth the thirde part of it awaye / ſtrayne it through & cloth / and let it coole / and drinke of it ſo muche thou liſteſt. It is good alſo to waſhe thy mouth in the morninge and at none wyth warme water / and to rubbe thy teth: alſo to waſh the forhead and temples wyth warme water / this clenſeth and maketh the head lighte.
         
         
            ¶An other ſyrop for the cough and apoſtemacion in the breſte and harte / whiche weakeneth and cauſeth to caſte oute.

            But if it is not conueniente to let the ſame bloode / then marke whether hys cough be cauſed by a hote humor / and to what parte it floweth / and on that parte ſhall ye ſet boxes / for that is good.
         
         
            ¶For the hote cough.
            
               GEue him to drinke ſyrope of Violettes / to bedwarde / at nighte / in the morning / and els when ye will / wyth a litle blood warme water. Theſame cooleth / molliſieth and cauſeth to caſt out: it ſlaketh thy

            ¶But when a man dyd cough / and were ſtrayght aboute the breſt and harte / and had heate therewyth / ſo that it were taken for an apoſtemacion.
            
               TAkē a diſhe full of Hempe ſede / put thereto a litle warm water / braye it well / and ſtrayne it wyth warme water / ſo that it become as a thyn parage. After that when it is colde / geue the patient therof to drinke ſo muche as he liſteth wythout hurte: the ſame doth mollifye & coole very well / ſlaketh thyrſte / and maketh large aboute the harte. And it is hood to ſeth that hempſede milke wyth

            But he that hath a conſuming cough / and were greatly trauayled therwyth / let hym eate at ones halfe a vnce of ſuger Benedicti.
                  A conſumynge cough.
                Then let hym take thre hoopes of a veſſell / the one alwaye greater then the other / & hang ouer them a couerled or tent cloth / tied to the roofe or plancher / in the forme of a bell dounwarde / and aboue narrowe / reachinge wythin a foote to the grounde. Vnder theſame ſet a ſtoole wyth a hole / but ſitting vpon theſame / he maye not reache wyth hys head to the chayne or feſteninge. Then take Malowes / Oerſtrawe of eche a great handfull / and as much of herbe Valeriane / ſeth theſame in a kettel well couered. After that put them into two robbes / and put the one vnder the ſtoole wyth a hole / into the other ſet thy fete as hote as thou canſt ſuffer it / and let the vapor ſtrike vp into the and vpon the naked body / vntill thou be fallen into a ſweat. If the tobbe vnder the ſtole doth caſt no more vapor / then laye a hote flintſtone therein / ſo ofte tyll thou be fallen in a ſweat: and thys ought to be done in a warme chamber / or hote houſe. Ye muſt not trauayl your ſelf to muche / leſt ye waxe to feble: and alſo if ye be fat / like ye haue a ſiege before ye attempt thys dry bath. When ye now do ſweate well / then laye you doun vpon a bedde in ye chamber or hote houſe: and if ye haue yet ſtrength to ſweate more / do ſo / for it is very good: for it weakeneth the harde matter / and maketh eaſye to be caſte out / whereof the cough is engendred. After the bath muſt ye not go in the wynde / and remayne that nyght in the hote houſe / or ſome cloſe chamber / and ſhoulde eat ſom thinge that geueth ſtrength / and drinke good drinkes: the meat muſt be ſuche as nouriſheth well / as are Oetmel gruel / Perſely ro

Take alſo oft in thy mouth the roote of the herbe called Pelitory of Spayne or Muſtarde ſede / chawe them / but ſwalowe thē not: that draweth much corruption doune. If the patient is ſtronge of complexion / than put a litle Niſinge pouder into his noſe / to drawe doune the euill humors / and beware of colde.
            He ought alſo holde hys mouth oft ouer a pott / wherein are ſodden Rapes or Nauets / that the hote breth or vapor maye go into his mouth / vntill hys face waxe reed / and he do ſweate: and let him kepe himſelfe warm thervpon. Thus may he do lykewyſe ouer a pott / wherin Appels or Peares are ſodden wyth wyne / Ale or Bire.
            Item if ye will be ridde of the running / take ix. matches made of brimſtone / put them into a pot ſtopped cloſe / ſaue a litle hole / make thē to burne / hang a clock or ſome thing vpon thy head / open thy mouth wyde open ouer the pott / and receyue that breth or vapor into it: thys do in the morning and euening / and the running ſhall breake or fayde.

               He yt hath the greping in his body with the cough / or els ſhoulde get an apoſtemacion with the cough / let him take iiij. vnces of a black ſhepes wol / put ye ſame as warme vpō his body / as he cā ſuffer it / ii

Ye muſt beware ye haue good ſieges / leſt ye get a greping therby.

               TAke Hempſede well beaten / mixte wyth water / and ſtrayned through a cloth / ſo that it waxe euen as milk / drinke therof in the nyght and toward night when ye are thyrſtye.
            Or els take Rapes or Nauettes as much as a fyſt / roſte the ſame wel in aſhes / yt they become as weke as a pere / ye reader they be / ye better are they: it greueth not though they be burnt ſomwhat. Theſame ſhall ye eate when ye go to bedde / as warm as ye can ſuffer it / and lykewyſe in the morninge. This is good alſo for horſeneſſe.

But ſome vſe nomore ſaue foure or fyue Pepper cornes / and chawe them / that taketh awaye the cough.
         
         
            ¶Of diſeaſe of the harte.
            
               
                  Hartes diſeaſe.
               CArdiaca is a diſeaſe of trembling of the harte / when it trembleth / leapeth and beateth / by reaſon of the humors / that are gathered within the celles or felles that enuiron the harte: and this ouertaketh the patiente ſodenlye / when the humors fall to neare the harte.
            If the humors are mixte with blood or colera / that cauſeth ouer greate heat / then trembleth the harte / and the patient waxeth feble / and thyrſteth very ſore / and draweth hys breth heauely.
            If the humor be mixt with melancolike blood / then trembleth the hart / and the patient is werry / thyrſteth not / and is faynt: wherfore ought ye hart

be holpen furthwith / ſeynge it is the moſt nobleſt parte of man.
            If the hartes diſeaſe commeth of colerik blood / which is hote and drye / then muſt he be let blood in the leuer: or els (without the ſeaſon do hinder it) geue him a drincke made of Caſſia fiſtula / tempered wyth Borage water / Bugloſſe water / and Medewort water / called in Latin Meliſſa.
            But if the diſeaſe come of Melancolick blood / make him a ſiege wt Diacartami thre quarters of an vnce in the morning / & let him walke wel vpon it. The third day geue him pilles de iera picra ſeuen in nombre to bedward: theſame clenſe the hart from fylth and noiaunce. It were good alſo to bath and ſweate / yet not to whote / leſt he waxe to feble.
            Somtyme commeth it of euill heat and moyſture / and corrupt blood / & then doth he ſweate ſore. The ſame ſhall be let blood vpon the left hand in ye veyne of the lightes / and anoynte hym wyth Paulinum / and oyle of Violettes / and geue hym ſuger of Roſes & light meates. Or els take a good tatt hen / yt hath ben killed ij. dayes before / yt ſhe be tender: of theſame ſeth a quarter very well wt water / in a pot wel cloſed and ſtopped / yt no breth can come out of it. Then take it out / & hold the quarter before the patientes mouth & noſe / & the ſauour therof ſhal comforte and ſtrengthen him very wel / & lette him drinke a litle of the broth. But if the patient hath taken cold / then put a litle Cinamon in ye water to ſeth wyth ye henne / for yt geueth good warmth. Thys pot oft tyme ought to be putt in a ſtillitory / called Balneum Marie / mixt wyth aſhes / and wel cloſed / and ought to ſeth thre houres / or more / vntill euery water be conſumed: and marke well whan it is inough.
            If a man hath a ſtiche about the hart / if it cometh of blood / or a hote humor / or a fall or bruſing / than geue him to drinke Endiue water / Pimpenell water / Moulbery water / or els Borage water.
                  Stiche about the harte.
                If ye haue not the waters / then ſeth ye herbes with water / & drink it. Or els take Borage ye herbe / chap it ſmal / & dight it lyke a thycke potage / put butter therin & eate yt in the morning / yt is very good. Bugioſſe is yet a more ſouerayne herbe to comfort the harte / dighted of this forſayd wyſe: but ye Borage potage is good for ye ſtiche about the hart / ſpecially if one maketh a potage therof with the herb of Daſye / ye helpeth wel / if a man were fallē or wounded: for it driueth awaye the euell blood / yt it auoyd from him wyth a ſiege. Alſo if a man haue any grefe or heuines about the hert: thē let him vſe ye herbe / floures or root of Borage / or els the water diſtilled therof or ſodden: for it comforteth the harte verye well / and maketh a man mery.
         
         
            ¶Of hartes febleneſſe or fayntneſſe.
            THat commeth thereby / whan the fylth is ſo encreaſed aboute it / that it can not expell and caſt it from it.
                  Faintnes of harte.
                Thys fylth is engendred by great ſurfeting and exceſſe / ſpeciallye in ſuch / as ſurfet & labour not / wherby their ſtomak waxeth ſo full / yt it can not digeſt it. Or els if a man had eatē meat euel to digeſt / wherby the body is fylled wyth ouermuch wind / & the hart febeled / whereof man getteth manye diſeaſes and inconueniences / as are ſcabbes / yuſhes or wheales / mattering ſores / karnels and the canker.
            But if thys filling or repletion is in the ſtomak / yt marke therby: he belketh or breketh much wind vpward / or perbreaketh / & hath payn in ye head.

Helpe theſame of this wyſe: Purge hym wyth a drinke of pouder of Sene / geue him in the eueninge a quarter of an vnce of pouder of Sene / and in the morninge as much / wyth a peaſe broth blood warme / and that ſhal cauſe him to haue a ſiege. The nexte day after / cauſe him to ſweat in a bath / (if hys ſtrength can ſuffer it) wt theſe herbes: Take Valerian / Popular / Heyſede and Ooteſtraw of eche a lyke / and geue him to eate broth and potages wyth a litle ſaffron / that comforteth the harte. If ye haue no ſaffron / then take pouder of Bugloſſe / or els geue hym potage thereof to eate / or cauſe him to perbreake / and tye hys legges wyth litle cordes / thruſt a ſquill dipped in oyle into hys throte / to cauſe him perbreake. Or els cauſe hym to perbreake wt Oken leaues / as I haue taught you before. Or els geue hym ten pennye weight of whyt niſing pouder / if he can ſuffer it: Howbeit I wold not gladly cōſel it / therfore beware alway of niſing pouder / if yu canſt forbeare it.
            
               
                  The maners of voyding the body
               It is to be noted / marked & knowē / ye great voyding & emptening of the body is by ſieges / by perbreaking / blething at the noſe / ſweat / floures of womē / rūning ſores / & by letting of blood / which is an abundant emptyninge / and weakeneth the body / chaungyng a man his color / & quenchyng his naturall heate / wherof then muſt the harte nedes waxe faynte / as well as of exceſſe of fyllinge or ſurffetty.
            
               
                  Soudain alteraciō
                  
               A raſh or ſoudayne alteration from heate into colde / ſtoppeth ye ſweate / and encloſeth the fylth wythin the body / whereby a man waxeth faynt and feble. It fortuneth alſo yt a mās harte waxeth faynt of ſoudayn ioye / & yt happeneth moſt to aged folke / whoſe nature cōſumeth. The harte alſo ſhrink together by reaſon of exceſſiue feare / heuineſſe & miſchange / or els by aſtōniſhment. For great ioy doth the harte ſo open it ſelfe / that the natural heat faydeth euen awaye / & then waxeth it cold and feble / that men do ſomtime dye for ouermuch ioye and gladneſſe. Somtyme waxeth the harte faint / by reaſon of the payne that other membres haue / for the payne ſtriketh to ye harte / and troubleth the naturall courſe the body and entrayles.
            If nowe ye harte is faint by reaſon of great emptineſſe / then let his face be cooled wt water / pul him by the noſe / & ſcratch him about ye holow or pit of ye ſtomak. But if the emptineſſe be in the vpper membres / then binde the nethermoſt membres.
            
               
                  Nota for vvarmīg and confortynge the hart.
               It is to be noted / yt nothing is better for faintneſſe of harte / thē yt a mā put hole ſaffrō in his drinke / & put alway a litle in his broth or potage: yt comforteth the harte very well / & warmeth a man: lykewyſe alſo doth Aqua vite / wherin is put hole ſaffrō & then dronke. Or els take euery day about one or two of ye clock at after none an egge / & roſt it / yt the whyte ther of waxe a litle hard: then take the yolke out of it / & put it into a diſhe alone / and poure a good ladel full of fleſhe broth / and put beaten ſaffron therein / as muche as though thou woldeſt ſalt an egge / put thereto alſo a litle ſalte / and drinke it then oute: that ſame is a greate comfortinge of the harte / and not only the harte / but alſo the whole body.
            
               
                  Voidnes in the nethermoſt mēbres.
               But if the voydneſſe or emptineſſe is in the nethermoſt membres / then tye hys vpper membres.
            And if his head do ake ſo ſore therof / that he thinketh to be raging therby / then helpe him of thys wyſe: Bath him ſoftelye / and he ſhall lyghtely

ſweate. And yf he hath heate in the heade / then make hym thys: Take an vnce of oyle of Roſes / vineagre halfe an vnce / beate thē well together / ſtrake thys oft about hys heade / thys alayeth the heate and ragynge of ye heade. Geue hym pilles de iera picra / and ſet hys fote oft in warm water / and rubbe them dounward. And when he taketh them out / then let hym rynſch them in colde water / and laye hym doune and reſt: but let hym haue the ſoles of hys fete vncouerd / that the euel humors and heate may drawe dounwarde towarde the fete. Geue hym to eate meates confortatiue: howbeit not to muche at once / vntyll he haue recouered ſtrength. If he be a man / he muſt beware of women: for that ſhulde hurte hym.
            Yf ye febleneſſe is come of heate or of vapor / helpe theſame of thys wyſe:
                  Faintnes of heate.
                Kepe him from anger or whote meates and from wyne / wythout it be very well alayed / and geue hym thys folowyng: Take the karnels of the Pomgranate / and as muche Barley meel / mixe theſame together / and make a potage thereof / lett hym eate that. Thys cooleth the harte / and conforteth it: it is alſo good for the ſtomake that is ouerchafed. But yf ye can not haue Pomegranates / than take in ſteade thereof Berberis.
            If the fayneneſſe commeth by trouble and colde / thē geue him ſuch thinges as warme him / and bath him in warme water / to warme him naturally / and let him drinke good wyne.
                  Faintnes by trouble and colde.
                Take alſo Saffron / Cinamon / Clowes / of eche a quarter of an vnce / Suger two vnces / Aqua vite half an vnce / water of Bugloſſe an vnce / whyte wyne a quarter of an vnce / put theſe together in a glaſſe / and let them ſtand a day and a nighte. After that drinke thre morninges therof faſtinge / that chafeth and warmeth the ſtomake / and comforteth the patient. And in hys meat ought he to put of the forſayd ſpices / and kepe him ſelfe warme / and beware of ſuch thinges as coole.
         
         
            ¶Of all accidentes and diſeaſes of the ſtomake / and howe it maye be healed.
            
               VVhan the ſtomake is full / and can not digeſt / it is to be marcked / whether the matter indigeſted commeth of ſuperfluous eatinge and drinkinge:
                  Of the accidences and diſeaſes of the ſtomack. Tokens of the euill digeſtion in the ſtomack.
                for that weakeneth the ſtomake and hys naturall operacion. And theſe are the tokens / whereby it is knowen / whether the diſeaſe commeth therof: the vapors come out of the ſtomake / & clim vp into the head: or els is hys mouth bitter / and he is thyrſty / & hath greate payn in hys eyen. Somtyme commeth the diſeaſe by vnmeaſurable and inordinate eatinge of colde meetes / and thereby is the naturall operation of the ſtomake altered and weakened: and in the bottom of the ſtomacke engendre euill humores / cauſinge that man can not digeſt. And theſe are ye ſignes whereby this is knowen: the vrine is whyte / thick and pale: aboue & in the midde is it clere / and in the bottom is it whyte as whey of milcke / ſynckinge and cleninge to the bottom as it were corrupt matter. The patiente hath greate payne in the kidneys and backbone toward the lefte ſyde. He hath alſo great colde in hys braynes / whych commeth thereby / that the ſtomak and braynes be farre aſunder / and the vapors drawe vp out of the ſtomake into the heade / and thereby is the colde of the braynes augmented.
            
               If the ſtomake were full of euell humors / that are hote / and were engedred of ſuch hote meates / as are Garleke / Ouyons / Muſtard / Pepper / and ſuche lyke / then are theſe the tokens of it: The paciente hath greate payne in the heade / he hath greate heate in the leuer / whyche is by reaſon of the hote meates that he hath eaten: for they inflamme the leuer / and conſume hyr moyſture. And if the paciente is of Sanguine or read Colera complexion / and eate ſuche hote meates / then getteth he feruente heate / and burneth lyke fyre: he conſumeth his naturall heate / and getteth an vnnaturall heate in al his body / and at the laſt getteth he a feruente ague / called ſtinkinge febres / by reaſon the naturall heate and the natural moyſtnes which manteyn the body / are conſumed.
            If the patiente is ſycke of the heate / then muſte he beware of all maner of hote meates / and that he eate not muche at ones / nor ſurfet. Hypocrates ſayeth: Lyke to lyke / miſtempereth the bodye: and therefore oughte colde meates be geuen hym / that is hote: and contrarywyſe hoate meates to hym that is colde / to ſette the bodye agayne in a frame. Therefore alſo is it conueniente to geue the patient lyghte meates of digeſtion / and colde / to reſtrayne the heate of the bloode and the read Colera.
            And if the diſeaſe were of flegma or black colera / or els of ſurffeting / thē muſt he be holpen of thys wyſe: He ought not to eate nor drinke muche / but hys meates ought to be ſuche / as warme & comforte the ſtomak. He oughte alſo to eat cōfectes of quinches / made with quinches / ſuger / or cheries / or wt ſuger & appels: theſame augment and reſtore agayn naturall moyſture.
            Item when a man hath hys ſtomake full of ſuperfluous hote moyſture / of ſa
                  •
               guin or reade Colera complexion: then muſt the euill humors be digeſted and prepared wyth anye of theſe drinckes / whyche ye can beſt gett. Take Barlye halfe a pounde / thre quartes of water / and ſeth them to the fourth parte / then ſtrayne it / and put therein the rootes of Succorye two vnces / Fenel rootes an vnce / Mayden heyre / Endyue of eche an vnce / the herbe Bugloſſe / the herbe Borage of eche half an vnce: poure ouer thys the foreſayde Barly water / and ſeth the fourth parte awaye / and then ſtrayne it agayne / put an vnce or an vnce and an halfe of ſuger to it / and geue the patient to drinke of it in the mornyng and euenynge. And when the matter beginneth to be ready / then purge the ſtomake of thys wyſe: Take electuarium de ſucco Roſarum thre quarters of an vnce / a quarter of an vnce Diaprunis laxatiui / Caſſie fiſtule extracte halfe an vnce / Hony of roſes half an vnce / water of Bugloſſe / Borage and Endiue of eche thre quarters of an vnce. Mixe all this together / and geue ye patient the one half at euening / and the other in the morning in the dawning / let him walk vpon this / and not lye doune agayne vntill nyne or ten of the clocke: for aſſone as the hote moyſture is prepared and digeſted / then is ſhe eaſy to be caſte oute / and wyded. And if the patient ſweat muche / then is it to be marked / that the bodye is full of ſuperfluous humours: and wyth digeſtyng of the humours / according to mans complexion / is he cured and made whole: and this aforemencioned drinke and purgacion is the digeſtion and auoydinge of ſuche fylth. After that ought ſome conſerues and Electuaries be miniſtred to him.
            The ſtomake doth ſomtyme wābel & is quaſy by reaſon of a heate / that

is engendred by vndigeſted meates / or vnwholſom meates / and the vapor thereof beateth vp into the head. Theſame diſeaſe happeneth ſomtyme of rawe humors in the ſtomake / and if ye take the patient by the body / then is it outwardly weake / and yet feble. Geue to theſame in the morninge halfe an vnce of Diacarthami / or els geue him halfe an vnce of Electuarij de ſucco roſarum: theſame clenſeth the rough moyſture out of the ſtomak.
            But if the ſtomak doth wamble of Melancoly / then is hys bodye hard and drye / when a man grypeth thereon. He that hath that diſeaſe / ought to anoynt the body wt oyle of oliue / wherin are ſodden Fenkel ſede or Kumin.
            If a man had ſome euell matter / vpon the mouth of the ſtomak / whiche he wolde gladly vomite out: or els dyd perceyue / he had muche ſlymy fylth within him / & wold fayne be rid therof by perbreakinge: or that his ſtomak did wamble: let him take grene Oken leafe in hys mouth / and chawe it. If ye can haue no grene leafe / then take a drye or ſeer oken leafe / and laye it in water / and then put it into thy mouth. Do this twiſe / thryſe or foure times / and it ſhall drawe much ſlyme and fylth. And if he hath any matter within him / then doth he caſt it out by perbreakinge. Or els take a litle ſpringinge water / and vinegre of lyke quantitie / and drinke thereof as muche as an egge conteyneth.
            If a man had gotten vnluſtyneſſe / that he had no appetite to meat / and waxeth heuy & faynt / nether can tell wherby it commeth / nor yet hath great heat:
                  To auoyde quaſineſſe and euell appetite.
                then is nothing better for him / then that he take thre hennes egges in the morning / and let them be thorow warmed. After yt let him breake them vp / and take away the whyte therof / and ſuppe out the yolkes / and drinke therevpon a good draughte of wyne / and faſte thereon vntill the eueninge / & walke ſomtyme: yt conſumeth the euill humors / whych cauſe vnluſtineſſe.
            But if he had gotten this vnluſtineſſe after meate / then let him eate no more after that vntill the euen / and then lette him eate a thynne pappe of oetmeel / made wyth wine / and let him drincke litle / for that is good. And when he will go to bed / then let hys fete be rubbed wyth vinegre / wherein is ſodden Wormwod: thys wil happely caſt him in a ſweate / that were very good.
            If the vnluſtineſſe commeth by aduerſitye and heuineſſe / then is he holye diſmade and heauy / and all what he doth / that greueth him. Theſame muſte be cured of thys wyſe: Lette him reſorte oft wher myrth is vſed / and eate meates good of digeſtion / and in all hys meates lette a litle ſaffron be put: for that comforteth the harte / but it cauſeth vnluſte in the ſtomacke / therefore oughte but a litle be put therein / yet cauſeth it good blood / and reioyceth the harte.
            He that hath an vnmeaſurable luſt to meate or drinke / the ſame hath alſo ſomtyme vnmeaſurable ſieges:
                  Gredyneſſe to meat and drinke.
                for the meat goeth oft from him not well digeſted / ſeynge the ſtomake nedeth not ouermuch meate / to digeſt well / & that it leaue not at the laſt euil humors. Theſame ought to drink good read wyne / and eat meates that do not ouerchafe the ſtomake.
            They that haue many cold humors in their ſtomake / let the ſame eat faſting rawe onyons wyth ſalte and courſe breade.
                  Cold humours in the ſtomake.
                Garlike doth alſo cōſume ſuperfluous humors in the ſtomacke / and helpeth it to digeſte: wherefore

it is good for labourers / that drinke much water / and eate colde meates: it driueth awaye alſo the dropſey.
            But if the ſtomack had ouermuch ſlymy humors in it / then oughte it he loſed wyth D
                  •
               acartami / or pilles of iera picra. But if it hath ouermuch heat then purge it wyth Electuarium de ſucro roſarum / in the morninge / wyth a peaſebreth. And after two or thre houres geue him yet peaſebroth that is not ſalted nor ſauoured / and let him walke / and not lye doune if he haue ſo muche ſtrength. Ye maye alſo eate grene ginger agaynſt a ſlymy ſtomake / the ſame warmeth it / and maketh digeſtion. Or els make a potage of yong Nettels / theſame warmeth the ſtomake / and conſumeth euill humors in it / and cauſeth good digeſtion. Grene Calmus doth lykewiſe eaten in the morning and euening / and purgeth the ſtomack.
            But if it is in winter / then eate in the morning and eueninge Anis ſede vpon breade / dipped in wyne / theſame clenſeth the ſtomak from ſlyme / and maketh good digeſtion. S. Ihons beries called in Latine Berberis / ſlake thyrſte / ſpecially that commeth of Colera or the gal / and ſtoppe the flixe / and make appetite to eate and drinke: they be good for the quauering harte / refrayne vomitinge / and are good eaten agaynſt bluſters or reed puſtuls / agaynſt the peſtilence / ſpeciallye when they are rype / ſtamped and ſtrayned through a cloth / and ſodden to the thyckneſſe of a pappe: kepe this through the whole yeare / and take therof a Walnut ſhell full at ones.

                Theſame ought to be cured of thys wyſe: he muſt be purged / after that ye perceyue hys complexion: and when he is in purgynge / make hym a bath / to drawe furth ſuche humors of th

               s wyſe:
            Take a pounde of Gentiane rootes / ſlyce them as ſmall as grotes / putte them into a litle bagge / put thereto two vnces of ſalt / and eyght quartes of water / and let the Gentian be well ſodden: and if thou nedeſt more water / take more of the fyrſte water. In thys bathe let him bath ſixe houres in the morning freſh and faſting / or according as he can ſuffre it. And if he would gladly eate or drinke / let him boldely eat a ſuppe / and drinke ones / to make hym ſtronge. When he hath now bathed ynough / then let him lye doune to bedde / and reſt or ſlepe well: and if a ſweate came vpon him / withoute procuringe / that were very good for hym / and that he might euen ſo reſt or ſlepe a litle. Then let hym eate that / wherto his minde ſtandeth beſt / whether it be Chekens or Pollets ſodden or roſted / Ryſs potage and other good potages. He muſt be ſober in eatinge and drinkinge / leſt he take a ſurffet / and the ſtomake be ſtopped / whereof is cauſed a lothſomneſſe to hys meat / and

            ¶Of ſweatynge.
            ONe maner of ſweate is naturall / the other vnnaturall.
                  Tvvo maner of ſvveates naturall and vnnaturall.
                The naturall ſweat commeth by it ſelf / ſo that a man ſweateth ouer all his bodye / and ſe that his nethermoſt partes are warme / and that his ſweat is warm / and that man waxeth not faynte of it / ye he reſteth better after it / and is lyghter than before. This is a token / that that man hath many humors with in hym / and that hys nature is ſo ſtronge / that it can expell and dryue oute theſame humors / and therfore is ſweatinge for ſuche one. They are alſo naturall ſweates / when a man goeth in hote houſes that are not ouer whore / and that man doth than beginne to ſweate: or els when one batheth in waters that are not ouer hote / and that he beginneth then to ſweate aboute the head and eyen. Thys ought not to be refrayned / for it is wholſome. Or els is it a naturall ſweate / when a man laboureth meaſurably / and is not ſo ſore chafed therewyth. All theſe are good and holſome / for they driue awaye from man the ſuperfluous humors.
            The vnnaturall or euell ſweate is it / that commeth towarde the euenynge / and is colde / and waltereth only about the harte. Theſame though it be not good / yet is it not ſo greately to be wythſtande. But when a man hath a greate diſeaſe or febleneſſe / and a colde ſweate breaketh oute onely aboute the noſe / that is a very deadlye ſigne / ſpecially when the noſethrilles open and cloſe fearcely / and the noſe waxeth ſharpe.
                  Tokens of death.
               
            
            But when he ſweateth onely aboute the harte / that is ſomtyme a token that a man is verye contrarye to hys nature / and that the heate is inwarde in hys bodye / and nature oute of frame / and the pories (whyche are the iſſues of the ſweate) ſtopped / whereby nature is not ſtronge inough to dryue oute the ſweate through the ſkynne. Beſyde thys are thoſe naturall ſweates / when men ſweate muche euerye daye: and that cometh thereby / that men haue ouermuche moyſtneſſe or humors wythin thē / and that muſt be abated then and letted.
            Theſe thynges cauſe to ſweate wythoute daunger: The floures and herbe of Camomille / or els Malowes / putte them into a cloſe tobbe / and make a bath ſo / that the vapor maye ſtryke vp into the.

                  A bath to make fruitfull.
               If ye will make a good naturall bath / that chafeth and warmeth well / and warmeth alſo baren women / that they become fruytefull: Take thre quartes of the rootes of Sloes / or ſixe good handfulles / cut them ſmal / and

It is good alſo to put thre hande full of ſalte into the kettel where they are boyled. And ſhe muſte beware of takinge colde / and vſe meates that warme.
            If the man be colde of complexion / then muſte he bath therein alſo / for the woman becommeth ſo muche the more fruytefull: for when a man batheth wyth a baren woman / they waxe ſo muche the more abler / and ſhe the more fruytefull. It were good to take the foreſayde rootes of Slo

                Theſame commeth ſomtyme from the Lyuer / ſomtyme from the Galle / ſomtyme from the Splene. The iaundis commynge from the Lyuer / is cauſed two wayes: ether by miſtemperatneſſe of heate / or by ſtoppynge in the lyuer. The iaundis cauſed by miſtemperaunce of heate / is of two ſortes: ſomtyme wyth apoſtemacion / ſomtyme wythoute apoſtemacion. But if the iaundis commeth by a wayſting wyth apoſtemacion / then are the ſignes in a man ſtrengthynge / trembling and a payne in the ryghte ſyde / a conſumpcion of the whole bodye / and miniſhynge of the ſtrengthe and the digeſtion / the water is as reade as bloode.
            The iaundis wythoute apoſtemacion hath no conſumpcion / ſtreyngthynge / nor tremblynge / and they haue alſo the commune token of yalowneſſe in theyr eyes / the face yalowe / pale or grene / the water reade and bloodye.
            Fyrſte ought medicine to be geuen for the apoſtemacion / if the iaundis is wyth an apoſtemacion / that it be fyrſte taken awaye / after that ſhalbe taken awaye the wayſtinge comming by the heate.
         
         
            ¶A true medicine for the Iaundis.
            TAke a handfull of Cherye leaues / ſeeth them in a pinte of milcke / that it boyle well / ſtrayne it / and drincke a good draught thereof to beddewarde and in the mornynge faſtynge / and the iaundis ſhall auoyde from you by ſiege. Or els drinke in the morninge and euenyng thys folowyng: Take the wood of Berberis / pyll the vpper ſhell wyth the leaues from it / and take the ſeconde ſhell that is yelowe: putte thereof as muche as a walnut in a cloth / and ſeth it wyth a pinte of water / that it be well boyled / and let it coole / and then drinke it. This hath ben experimented / put thereof alſo in thy drinke.
         
         
            ¶Agaynſte the deſperate iaundis.

If he ſweate / then draweth the iaundis into the ſhete / and waxeth yalowe.
            Hym that the yalow iaundis taketh / is wel perceyued by hys eyes / handes / ſoles of the fete / and the yalow colour of the whole body.

               TAke Celidony both the herbe and roote / chappe it ſmal / and when ye haue a pottel thereof / ſeeth it in water / and let it be well couered / that no vapor maye go oute / and make therewyth a ſweatynge bath / and if ye ſweate well / the iaundis ſhall auoyde by it.
         
         
            ¶Another true and hurtleſſe ſcience for the iaundis.
            TAke the ſede of Ancolie or Accolie beaten to pouder / a quarter of an vnce / put thereto beaten ſaffron a peny weyght / and an vnce of vinegre / and two vnces of water of Celidony / ſteare them well together: theſame ſhoulde be dronken faſtynge or to bedwarde / and drinke not after it. The ſame driueth out the iaundis by the vrine harmeleſſe. In the mornynge draughte putte ſuger / that maketh it good. It maye alſo be mixte wyth as muche Southiſteen water / as maye be droncke at ones: or take the floure of Cichore and rootes / and ſeth them in half wyne / halfe water / and drinke therof faſtynge / and at euen.

               If one had the iaundis / and were ſo bounde in hys belly / that he coulde haue no ſieges / then make him thys ſolutorye. Marke whether he haue a heate / then geue hym to bedwarde halfe an vnce of Viol ſyrop / wyth as muche colde water / and geue hym in the mornynge halfe an vnce of Electuarium de ſucco roſarum / tempered wyth a warme Hennes broth / or a broth of Calues fleſhe / or els a broth of whyte Peaſen / and let him drinke a good draught after that.
            But if the heate nor bitterneſſe wold go awaye / then geue hym faſting a quarter of an vnce of Rebarbara / wyth an vnce and an halfe of water of Moulberryes / and the next daye let hym blood in the Lyuer veyne / and let hym beware of all meates that warme. Geue hym ſomtyme warme water into hys mouth / to waſhe it there wyth / and afterward cold water / to renſche it: do thys in the morninge / and let hym weſh his handes lykewyſe. Or els let him drincke diſtilled water of Hertes tounge / or the herbe ſodden in

Or els take the pouder of Ancolye ſede / and beaten ſaffron / of eche a peny weight / and halfe an egges ſhale full of wyne / and as much water / and as muche vinegre: mixe theſe v. together / and drinke that to bedward / and in the morning faſtinge: thys helpeth very well / and is experimented.
         
         
            ¶A good pouder for the iaundis.
            TAke the ſkinne of a Hennes mawe / waſhe it fayre wyth wyne / drye it / and make it to pouder.
                  A pouder for the iaundis.
                And when thou wilt ryſe from the borde or ſupper / then ſuppe a pece of bread in wyne / and put of that pouder theron / and eate it to bedwarde / and in the morninge faſting: thys is a ſouerayne thing for the iaundis in the ſtomak.
            Or els take earth wormes ſo much as halfe a walnutt / cut them ſmall / and braye them wyth a litle wine or water / ſo that ye may ſwalow it: drinke the ſame faſting / and hold a ſlyce of bread toſted with ſalt warme before thy mouth / and drinke Endiue water therevpon: mixe wine alſo and water of Endiue together / and drinke that to bedward.
            He that hath the iaundis vpon the tonge / or that his toung were drye or hote / let him take Pſyllium / that is to ſaye Fleewort / as great as a Filbert / let him put it in a fyne cloth / and laye it in warme water thre houres long: after that let him ſtrake hys tounge therwyth otherwhyles / theſame draweth out the euill heate / cooleth the tounge / and taketh awaye the bitterneſſe. Lykewyſe doth Sauge layde in colde water / and layeth alwaye a freſhe leafe thereof on it. A Plantayne leafe layd in colde water / and ſo laid wett vpon the tounge / do lykewyſe: for it cooleth the mouth / and taketh awaye the bitterneſſe. But if it were winter / and ye could not haue the herbes: then take litle flynte ſtones / laye them in water / and do as is ſayde before.
            He that hath the iaundis ſo feruently and ſore / that he can nether tayſte nor drinke wyne or good drinke: let theſame drinke Barley water at all tymes / for that alayeth the heate of the iaundis and gall / and nouriſheth wel. And if he can eate no meate / yet let him eate a pappe of Barly ſodden wyth water and butter / and let hym vſe that / vntill he can eate other meate: and let hym drinke alſo water of Lillies / or Iſop / or Bugloſſe.
            There is an herbe called Herbe of iaundis / it is ſo right grene as graſſe / and hath a longe ſtalke / and longe leaues / faſhioned lyke Eſula / ſaue that it hath no milcke / as Eſula doth. Of thys herbe take a hand full / and a quart of water / ſeth them well: of thys water let the patient drink in the morning and eueninge / and temper hys drinke therewyth: theſame breaketh and driueth awaye the iaundis ſore wythout grefe / ſo that it is perceyued in the vrine. Or els take the ſede of Ancolye or Accolye the weight of twinty wheaten cornes / mixt wyth two egges ſhalesfull wyne / drinke theſame faſtinge in the morninge / and as muche to bedwarde: theſame driueth the iaundis ſtrayghtwaye from you in the vrine.

            It is good alſo for the iaundis / to ſtrake the weaſt of the handes verye well wyth warme wyne / in the morning / at none / and eueninge: for it draweth the iaundis from the ſtomake.

            ¶Howe to helpe a man that hath a diſeaſe or a ſtiche in hys ſyde / or an euell ſplene / or an apoſteme wyth in vpon hys rybbes.
            
               
                  Payne or ſtiche in the ſyde and the tokens of it.
               
               PAyne in the ſyde commeth of euill ſtinkinge moyſtneſſe / whych cauſeth an impoſteme in the left ſyde vpon the ribbes. If the apoſteme commeth vpon the ribbes / then dyeth a man lyghtely wythin thre dayes of the ſtenche of the apoſteme / ſtrikinge to the harte / wythout a ſpedy remedy be ſought. Fyrſt ought he to be well letten blood in the Median in the right arme: and if the apoſteme is in the ryght ſyde / thē ought he to be letten bloode in the left arme. And before all is it to be knowen ſayeth Galen / whereby the apoſteme is occaſioned / afore ye miniſtre ought to hym / and alſo in whych ſyde the diſeaſe is. If it is in the ryght ſyde / then commeth it of the lyuer: If it is in the left ſyde / then cometh it of the ſplene: and therfore haue Hipocrates and Auicenna ſayd / that he that hath this diſeaſe / ſhoulde be letten blood in great quantitye / after that hys ſtrength is.
            If the diſeaſe is in the left ſyde / than doth hys harte ſhake and beat / and hath great payne in hys left ſyde / handes and fete are colde / payne in the reynes / ſtrong and feruent agues / and great ſtichynge when the ague commeth vpon hym: the diſeaſe is come of Flegma and black Colera.
            But if the diſeaſe is in the right ſyde / then commeth it of the lyuer and of ſuperfluous bloode / and therefore is it requiſite to miniſhe a greate deale of the patientes blood at the begynnynge / after that he hath ſtrength. And he that hath thys diſeaſe / the ſame hath febres acutas / and great payne in the forheade / and all his membres do ake. He hath alſo in hys ſlepe many imaginacions

and dreames / and thyrſteth: all ſwete meates are contrarye to hym / and liſteth after ſoure meates and eger / he hath alſo great heate in the lyuer. His face and eyes alſo are reade / hys noſe continuallye ſharpe and ſeere or drye: the ſecond daye after that the diſeaſe leaueth hym / than chaungeth hys face / and the nayles of hys fingers become whyte. Theſe foreſayde tokens are not good / for they ſignifye the death of the patiente wythin thre dayes. If the patient in the beginning of thys diſeaſe doth liſt to drinke wine / then ought the Phyſicion to beware how to counſel hym.
            When a man hath a ſtich in hys ſyde / then geue hym to drynke water of Morſus diaboli / (that is an herbe / whoſe roote is as it were bitten of) ether diſtilled or ſodden. Lykewiſe alſo doth Saffron dronke. Or els take hony & milke of a Cowe of eche halfe a pinte / let thē be wel warmed together / wet a linnen cloth of halfe an elle longe and broade therein / and laye it ſo warm therevpon / and the ſtiche will ſtrayght waye be alayed.
            Howbeit I haue alwaye put thereto wheaten meel thre quarters of an vnce / and two penny weyght of beaten ſaffron / ſtraked vpon the cloth / and layd warme vpon it lyke a playſter. But in ſommer did I laye the leaues of whyte Horehunde / chapped ſmall / and put in a bagge / ſodden in milke / preſſed out / and layed warme vpon the ſyde / theſame ſwaged it. I haue ſomtyme alſo vſed it ſeere.
            Or els take a fyne lynnen cloth / and folde it ſo / that it be a ſpanne long / wet it in the pacients vrine / whyle ſhe is yet warme / preſſe it oute a litle for droppinge / and laye it where the ſtiche is. And when it is drye / then wett it agayne therein: theſame draweth the humours oute / and alayeth the ſtiche furth wyth. Though thys ſcience doth not ſo wholye ayde / yet doth it not hurte / though it were a woman in chyldes bedde. Or els take a colde flinte ſtone or pauing ſtone and holde it vpon the ſore place / and the blood draweth back / and the paciente is healed.
            The barkes of an Aſhe tree / ſodden in wyne / and droncken of hym that hath a harde ſplene / theſame doth weaken it wythout doute: Thys may ye proue of thys wyſe: Geue a ſwyne theſame barckes to eate nyne dayes one after the other / and when it is ſlayne / loke after the ſplene / and ye ſhall not fynde it halfe.
            He that hath payne in hys ſyde / let him take a kake of beaten Lineſede / ſeth it in water / and wet a linnen cloth therein / and laye it warm vpon the ſyde / and it ſhall fayde ſtrayghtwaye. When a man hath a payne in hys ſyde / and ſpeciallye in the left ſyde / then take a quarte of whyte wyne / the ſixte parte of a quarte of honye / a hande full of Percely / or els two vnces of the ſede thereof: ſeeth theſame in a newe pott / the ſixte parte awaye / geue hym the ſame to drincke when it waxeth colde / both in the morninge and eueninge / and he ſhall waxe whole doutleſſe. Or els if a man hath greate ſtiches and payne in hys ſyde / I toke halfe a pounde of milcke / two vnces of honye / an vnce of wheaten meel / a penyworth of Saffron / and layde it warme thereon.

Or els take a bondel of rawe hempe threde / and ſeth it in water where are manye aſhes / and laye it ſo warme vpon the belly.
            If ye haue no hempe threde / then do as I did when I was called by a woman / that was at the poynt of trauaylinge / and had ſo greate payne in her bellye / that the chylde lept vp and doune / ſo that all they that were aboute her / were aſtonnyed / nether durſt anye man miniſter oughte to her: I bande both her legges aboue the kne hard and faſte wyth a bande / and let it ſo alwaye an Aue Maria / and then loſed it agayne a litle ſpace / and band it agayne ſo oft / tyll the payne was holy taken awaye.
            Auicenna ſayth / that a man maye well drinke hote water in Colica paſſide / that is grepinge in the great guttes / and alſo when the ſplene ryſeth and ſwelleth.
            If any man were miſtempered and hard in hys body / nother could make water / then take two hand full of Wormwood / cut it ſmall / and put it in a bagge a quarter of an elle longe and brode / ſeth the ſame in halfe water / halfe wyne / ſtrayne it out a litle / that it droppe not / laye it vpon his body as warme as he can ſuffre it halfe an houre longe / and let hym eat twelue carnels of Peaches. And when the bagge waxeth colde / then let him warme it agayne in the former water and wyne / and thys ſhal he do in the morning / at none / and in the eueninge: of thys wyſe ſhall the miſtemperaunce of the bodye and hardneſſe be alayed / and he ſhall well make water.
            Or els take branne and water Creſſes / of eche alyke / aboute two quartes / chappe the water creſſes very ſmall / make a bagge large a quarter of an elle / and as longe / that it maye well reche about your loynes / then putte the water creſſes and branne therein / ſteare them wel / leſt they cluſter / ſeth it well in a kettel wyth water / anoynte the loynes wyth Meye butter / or other butter ſo bigge as an egge / and it that is left of the butter / laye vpon the nauel / and couer it wyth a litle diſhe: then preſſe the backe a litle out / leſt it droppe / and winde it about the patient as warme as he can ſuffre it: do thys in the morninge / at none / and to bedwarde / let it lye an houre or more at euery tyme / after that he is ſtronge and can ſuffre it.

               Somtyme doth it fortune alſo nature to become ſo drye and ſeere / that the meate can not voyde for greate drought / wherof he hath ſo great payn / that he euen ſwelleth.

But the outwarde cauſe is / ſome greate laboure / which a man doth / and ſtrayneth hym ſore / ſo that the guttes are thereof ſo fretted / that the bloude foloweth thereafter.
            If ye will knowe whereof it is / then take hede to the matter / that iſſueth from him wyth the bloude: If it be reede / then is it of Colera: but if it is as the vnclenneſſe of the noſe / then is it of Flegma. After that muſt ye take hede whether the bloude commeth of the vpper guttes / or of the nethermoſt guttes / or els the middelmoſt guttes. If it commeth from the vppermoſt guttes / then hath he payne aboue the nauel: if it iſſueth from the nethermoſt guttes / then hath he payne beneth the nauel.
            When now the bloud commeth from the vpyermoſte guttes / then geue the pacient his medicine into his mouth. Is it of the reed Colera / then geue him gumme Arabick wyth the iuyce of Porcelen / wyth a ſyrop of Mirtill / and geue him ſyrop of Roſes / and geue him bread ſtyped in Almondes beaten / and geue him to drinke water ſodden wyth ſmall raſins.

This diſeaſe happeneth ſomtyme of an hote apoſteme in the ſtomake. It commeth alſo of a colde humor / that is gathered in the ſtomake. The reſtraynte cauſed by an apoſteme / is knowen thereby / that the belly is ſwollen / and he draweth winde or breth vneaſely: he getteth alſo an ague and great thyrſt. But if the reſtraynt were of a cold humor / theſame is not ſwollen in the bellye / and he is withoute an ague or thyrſte: his handes and fete are colde / he is heuy and waketh much / nother can reſt in one place / ſomtyme will he haue thys / ſomtyme that. He that is thus diſeaſed / dyeth lightely the third daye / and he is paynfull to heale.
            If ye will take in hand to heale ſuch a diſeaſe / then take hede firſt / wher of ſuch reſtraynte is cauſed. If it is cauſed by an apoſteme / then geue hym Caſſia fiſtula with Iera picra / tempered wt oyle of Violettes. If the ſikneſſe is ſtrong / thē let him bloud in the liuer veyne / and make hym a cliſter wyth Malowes / Barly / Lentils / and oyle of Violettes.

Or els take the floure of Fenegreke halfe an vnce / and hony a quarter of an vnce: mixe theſame together with warme water / ſo much as nede is / and geue him theſame to drinke faſting & to bedwarde: theſame purgeth the guttes of the ſuperfluous ſlyme / wherof is cauſed ſomtyme greate payne and grepinges.
            But for the greping as in the great guttes / take ye bladder of a Swine / and put it full of warme wyne / laye it vpon the nauel as hote as ye can ſuffre it / do it oft / and it ſhall take awaye the payne / theſame hath oft ben experimented and proued. Or els take a black Henne / and laye her warm vpon the nauel / cut it in two peces or ſliced quicke. Agaynſte anye maner of other grepinge / take the harte of a Wolffe and the guttes / drye them / & make pouder of them: put theſame into a boxe. In that pouder growe litle wormes / let theſame therin / & when ye will vſe thē / take thē one after the other / bray or breake thē wyth wyne / and geue it him to drinke.
            Or els take half an vnce of oyle of Benedicta / oyle of Camomil / oyle of Meliſſa or Baume / of eche a quarter of an vnce / mixe them together / & bid the pacient lye vpon hys backe / and put foure or ſixe droppes of the oyles in to the pacientes noſe / as warme as he can ſuffre it wyth a fether or other thynge: laye a whot cloth vpon it / and let it lye ſtil.

            Or els take whyte cattes dounge / brayed and made fyne to pouder / ſtere that wyth whyt wyne / and geue it him to drinke thre tymes. Or els take reed nettels that haue reed floures / wyth the rootes a good handfull / ſeth them well wyth a pint of good wyne / coole it / and geue him it to drinke.

            This is alſo a noble medicine and oft proued: Take yolkes of egges / & a litle chalke / & four ſpounfull of ſtrong vinegre: geue theſame the paciente to drinke in the morninge faſting / and do this thre morninges one after the other / and they ſhall drye without dout. After that geue hym a quarter of an vnce of Eſula / and theſame dryueth awaye from hym all the wormes and fylthyneſſe.
            This is alſo a ſure and proued medicin: He that hath wormes in his belly / theſame ſhal drinke water ſodden wyth hony / & that ſhal he do twyſe or thre tymes faſtinge / that the wormes maye be drouned therewyth. After yt ſhall he drincke the iuyce of Wormwood / Fumiterre / Peaches / & leaues of Beanes: hereof muſt they all dye: Or els take ij. vnces of the iuyce of Wormwood / an vnce of Oxes gall mixte together / & ſtraked vpon the belly. And if ye put half an vnce of Aleopaticum & Euphorbium / then helpeth it ſo muche

the better: howbeit the gall of an Hare were better then of an Oxe.
            Agaynſt the wormes in the belly take onyons and pyll them / cut or ſlyſe them ſmall / powre ſpringinge water ouer them / let it ſtande ſo all nighte / & in the morninge drinke that water / and it driueth away al wormes. Poure theſame water vpon the earth where wormes are / & within halfe an houre ſhall they crepe out of the earth.
            Lykewyſe if one eate garlike faſtinge / it killeth & driueth out wormes out of the bodye Or els drinke diſtilled water of knotgraſſe or ſhauegraſſe / theſame killeth wormes alſo: howbeit it worketh more in yonge then olde folke.

But if ye haue no ſyrop of Violettes / then drinke a good draught of whaye of milke bloud warme / and anoynt the nauell wyth creme / theſame ſoffteneth wel. But I haue ſomtyme taken for poore people only the Gall of an oxe / and ſwynes fat or grece of lyke quantitie / molten together / and ſtraked their nauel well therewyth / and layed thereon of it as bigge as a walnut / & couered a diſhe vpon it. But if he was colde / then toke I butter in ſteade of ſwynes grece / and did as is ſpecified before / theſame mollifyeth very well.

If ye will haue it to mollifye yet more / put thereto the thyrde parte ſo much of rootes of Malowes / as is of the Peaſe broth: & this ſhal ye vſe in ſtead of the ſyrop of Violettes.

halfe an vnce of Diaprunis laxatiui / theſame is ſoure / and hath theſame operation / and dryueth out very eaſely.

            But if it were a fiſhe day when he would take it / then geue him a peaſe broth in ſtede of a fleſhbroth / as is ſpecified before.
            He alſo that hath a wambling in hys ſtomake / or doth lightely perbreake / when he hath taken ought:

Theſame mollifyeth hym well / that he maye haue ſieges wythout hurt.
            If a man had taken a medicine laxatiue / and it were to ſtronge for him / ſo that he muſt do his eaſement to often / wherof he might get a grepinge or other inconuenience:
                  Reſtraīte of ouermuch ſieges or greping.

But if the rubbel or ſhardes of the ſtone do put the to payn / then vſe that bath / wherof I haue ſpoken before.
            Take the rotes of Perſely and herbe / the herbe of Fenel with the rotes / Dyll with the rootes / Smalage with the rootes / of ech a handfull / and of eche ſede a handfull: chap the rotes and herbes ſmall / and put them alltogether into a ſmall fyne linnē bagge / ſeth thē well in water yt ſpace of an hour / & make a bath therof / & bath therein. Then lay the bagge a whyle vpon the backe / as warme as ye can ſuffre it / after that vpon the belly likewyſe: after that ſit vpon the bagge alſo as warme as ye can ſuffre it. And of thys wyſe bath in the morning thre houres / at after none two houres / and at night to bedward. Do this thre dayes / and vſe to eate the rotes of Perſely / and the ſede of Smalage / and the ſede of Perſely / of eche an vnce / make pouder of thē / put thereto two vnces of ſuger / & when thou wilt depart frō the table / then dippe a ſlice of bread in wine / & ſtrowe as much of this pouder theron / as a cheſt nutte. Eat this alſo in the morning faſting / & to bedward: & thus ſhall the ſtone auoyde frō thy without any ſmart or payne / & ye ſhall make water eaſely. But beware of all thinges that engendre the ſtone.

It were good alſo he dyd drinke water of Horſe radice / when he bateth / and alſo before and after the bath: for that alſo driueth out the ſtone.
         
         
            ¶Thys folowyng is alſo good for the ſtone.

Or els take the rotes of Horſe radice cut checkerwyſe / like to dice / the weight of foure vnces / poure ouer them a good quarte of the beſt wine yt ye can get / and let it ſtande a daye and a night: after that drinke thereof in the morning and eueninge / at eche tyme foure vnces. Theſame driueth out the ſtone in the bladder & raynes / preſerueth a man from payne of the bladder and raynes / withſtandeth perbreaking. Some do digge a pott in the grounde / with the Horſe radice roote / the depth of a kne Or els take commun radice rotes / let them ſtande in the earth / but pare of the vttermoſt croune next to the herbe / and make it holowe / then laye the croune agayne vpon the roote. If a water be gathered therein / take and vſe theſame: for it is very good for the Stranguria / & for them that do make their water wyth difficultye and droppinge / but ſpecially for the ſtone in the bladder.
         
         
            ¶A good true medecine for the ſtone / whiche is good and approued for commune people.
            TAke the berries of Iuy / beate them to pouder / and drinke therof in the morninge and eueninge / at eche tyme a quarter of an vnce with an vnce and an halfe of wine. This hath driuen from women ſtones as bigge / ſome as a dowes egge / ſome as Walnuttes / ſome as chaſtnuttes / ſome as fylberts or ſmaler / and that with payn and trauayl.

            ¶Of Agues / and fyrſt howe he maye be cured that is ouertaken wyth Ephemera.
            Ephemera is a feuer ſo called / becauſe it is apte to be cured in one daye / but if it is not regarded / turneth to ſundery kindes of agues or feuers. This diſeaſe happeneth ſomtyme of the Sonne heate / whereby the head waxeth hoter then anye other membres. Somtime commeth it of exceſſe of colde / and then becommeth a man rediſh vnder hys eyen / & his body waxeth cold outwardly / & the head heuy. Somtime commeth it with ſurfettinge wyth meates or drinkes that be hote or colde / and thereof waxeth hys vrine reed. Somtime happeneth it of anger / & then waxeth his face reed / and his eyen drawe forwarde / and turne very ſwyftlye in his heade. Alſo doth it happen

by heauineſſe and greate perplexitye and aduerſitye / and then do his eyen ſyncke in his head / and loketh grimly / and hys body waxeth feble / and hys pulſe beateth fayntly.
            When the ague commeth by the Sonne heate / then ſet the pacient a litle in a bloud warme bath the ſecond / or at the laſt the thyrd daye / that he do ſweat therein: After that ſet him in a coole place / and there ſtrowe leaues & braunches of Wylowes / and ſtype Myrte beries in oyle of Violettes / and ſtrake theſame oyle into hys noſe thrilles / and take oyle of Roſes and vinegre of lyke quantitie / beate them well together / & anoynte his temples & for head therwith / & the wreſtes of his handes & fete. Geue him to drinke milk of Poppy ſede / made of this wiſe: Put water to ye ſede / then beat it / & mixe it with water / yt it become like an almond milke / & ſtrayn it through a cloth into a glaſſe / & geue him it to drinke when he wil go to bed / in the morning & in the day tyme a good draught. Ye muſt alſo coole him firſt: and whē he is otherwhyles thyrſty / geue him bread ſtiped in colde water to eat / and he muſt beware of all ſuch thinges as maye chafe him / if he drinketh wine / let him alaye it well / or let it be ſoure.
            If the ague commeth or is cauſed by colde / & that the pacient beginneth to conſume / then ſet him aboue a tobbe with hote water / wherin are ſoddē Camomille floures / Dyll & Baſil: put alſo of that water into a pot / & let the pacient receiue the vapour of it into his body beneth & at the mouth. Or els ſet him in a tobbe with the forſayd herbes / that were better for him: Or els make him a bath with the forſaid herbes / and let him warme himſelfe wel / after that anoint him well with oyle of Dyll / for theſame is good and conuenient for him.
            If the ague commeth by heuyneſſe or mourninge / or a drye occaſiō / then ſet his fete in warme water / vntill his knees / wherein is ſodden Camomill and Dyll / of eche two handfull / and couer the tobbe well / that the vapoure maye ſtryke well into his body / as is ſayde before / and through the mouth. Let his legges alſo be rubbed dounwarde / for that doth him much good / after that let him walke / or vſe ſome other conuenient exerciſe: he muſt alſo beware for taking cold / & eat meates yt warme him moderatly / & be good of digeſtion / he muſt alſo beware of eating and drinking vnmeaſurably.
            If the ague is cauſed of hote meates or drinkes / then geue hym Oxizacra with milke of Poppyſede or Sorell.
            When the ague beginneth to fayle / then geue him the ſeconde or thyrde daye to drinke water diſtilled out of ye rootes of broade Planteyn / thre morninges one after another / at eche tyme an vnce and an halfe / or two vnces / and make him an Epithema / that is a medicine vpon the liuer of thys wiſe: take two vnces of Endiue water / an vnce of water Cicory / and halfe an vnce of water of Roſes / mixe theſe together / and dippe towe of Hempe therin / and laye it vpon the liuer. Let him alſo eate meates of good digeſtiō as are yonge Mottons / Lambes / Chyckens / Hogges fete / and ſuch like. Let him eſchue ſalt meates / and be ſobre in eating and drinking: and after meate let him vſe moderate walkinge or ſtearing / where good ayer is / and ſo ſhall he recouer eaſely and well.
            If the ague is cauſed of heauineſſe or greate aduerſitye or diſtreſſe / 

then muſt the grefe be taken awaye with frendlineſſe & good conuerſacion with mirth and ſuch paſtimes and recreations / as maye reioyce him / and not longe remayne in one place / but let him abyde wher good ayer is / & vſe to bath ſomtyme. After yt he hath reſted / & will cloth him / then anointe him with oyle of Roſes or oyle of Violettes. Let him waſhe ſomtime in warme water / & when he wil cloth him / then anoynt him as before. Let him alſo be chaſt / & his meates & drinkes of good digeſtion / that do alſo mollify & coole him. He maye not vſe ſtronge drinkes / but Barly water to bedward / theſame mollifieth and cooleth him: hote meates do hurte him.
         
         
            ¶Of the hote and feruent ague / called Cauſon.
            
               FEbris cauſtica is / when the Colera periſheth in the veines that are neare the harte / and them that are aboue in the ſtomake / liuer and lightes or poulmon. It is cauſed of a feruent heate / and the pacient hath exceding heate and thyrſte. This diſeaſe is of two ſortes: ye one is of a ſingle Colera / the other ouertaketh moſte chefelye ionge folke / when their body is drye. When their vrine is ſcommy / then be ſure / that they are coſtiffe and bounde about the hart / and get a great diſeaſe and payne in the head. The vrine of them both is reed / and they waxe feble. Ye muſte purge and clenſe them with pilles or laxatine / but they muſt be mollified before wt ſyropes of Violettes / or ſyropus acetoſus / and with Electuariū de ſucco Roſarum / or Diaprunis laxatinus / ſo yt they be ſtrong inough / or yt ye age do not hinder thē / if he hath much vnclene matter in him. If he be greatly thyrſty / thē geue him otherwhyles Pōgranates or ſorel to ſuck / & to bedward geue him to drinke ſyropes of Violettes or Roſes / with as much cold water: like wiſe do at none & in ye morning / & he muſt beware of ſuch thinges as chafe him: he muſt alſo be let bloud in ye liuer veyne. Let him drinke wine / & alaye it well wyth water. His meate muſte be meates of good digeſtion and cooling / nother eate more then nede requireth.
            If his belly is bounde / then loſe it with Caſſia fiſtula / ſyropes of Violettes / & Endiue water: make him a cliſter with ye iuice of Branke vrſine / Trifle / herbe of Violettes & Malowes / without the age / the time / the ſtrength or the region or countrey do hinder the.
            If he hath payn in ye head / thē make him this ſointment / & anoint his tē
               ples & forhead therewith: take oyle of roſes / the iuice of Porcelain / vinegre / of eche an vnce / beat thē well together / & when ye will vſe it / beat it agayn / and make him a plaiſter therof vpon the forhead and temples.
            Take read Saunders / Roſes / Barly meel of lyke quantitie: put thereto as much Roſe water / that ye may mixe the other thinges therwith / & make a paſt thereof / & put the iuyce of Gourd therto if ye can get it: This alayeth the payne ſone and well. Or els take Poppye ſede / and beate it verye well / temper it wyth water / and geue hym alwaye a litle thereof to drinke / and ſpecially in the night: and wett a linnen cloth therin / and binde it vpon hys forheade.
            But if he can not ſlepe / thē take Lettice ſede beatē / Almondes beaten / ye iuice of Lettice / of ech an vnce / water of Roſes / oyle of Roſes / of eche halfe

And if the payne go away / then geue him to eat Gourdes & Porceleyne / & when he will go to bed / then let him waſhe his fete in warme water / and rub hys legges well beneth dounwarde / and afterward renche them in cold water. After that let him lye doune / and leaue his fete vncouered / and ſo draweth the heat out dounwarde: Let him do to his handes lykewiſe.
            If he waxeth faynt in the night for heat / then take water of Roſes / and halfe ſo much vinegre / in theſame wet two clothes / eche ſo muche as a fyſt / and geue him thē in his hande / tyll they waxe hote: theſame draweth out al the heate. Rub the ſoles of his fete therwith alſo & his wreſtes / for it geueth him good ſtrength. Geue him confecte of ſuger in his mouth / or els confecte of Cheris / or of ſoure Plummes / theſame ſlake his thyrſt.
            If a woman were diſeaſed hereof / & were bigge wyth chyld / the forſaid medecine might be geuen her wel inough without danger. But if one were thus diſeaſed / and a yexing toke him / or a goute / and it laſted foure & twenty houres or more / that is a ſure token of death.

Great inconuenience get chyldren with theſe diſeaſes / and ſpecially the Pockes: for they ſtraye ouer all the bodye / and the eyes alſo / and when theyr eyen do itche / they waxe lightely blind therof. If ye will ſaue them that they ware not blinde / hange the rootes of Rew and Scabioſe at their necke / and they ſhalbe ſafe.
         
         
            ¶Of the dayly ague or feuer quotidiant.
            THe ague or feuer that taketh a man euerye daye / is cauſed of Flegma / when it falleth into the bloud and veines / thē doth the ague ſhake one / and the colde is great. But when it is without the veines / then hath the pacient colde euery day / and the ſhakinge nor froſt is not ſo great. This ague haue moſt communly aged folke / and ſuch as are colde or moyſt of complexion. It taketh them alſo chefely / that are ydle / and vſe exceſſe / and ſpecially them / that eat or drinke out of ſeaſon / wherewyth engendre wythin them many colde humors.
            When the pacient is very thyrſty / and his body is drye / then is his ague cauſed of ſalt flegma / wherfore geue him ſuch thinges / as drawe out moyſtnes / and ſet his fete in warme water / wherein are ſodden Dill and Camomille: and when hys fete are dried agayn by themſelues / then take ſalt and oyle of Violettes / of like quantitie / and rub the ſoles of his fete therewyth. He muſt be purged alſo wt ſuch medecines / as purge flegma: for if the paciēt is diſeaſed by the flegma / then is the diſeaſe more durable.
            He that hath the dayly feuor or ague / nother can be quit of it / theſame is

a token / that he hath corrupte bloude in his backe. To eaſe theſame / were it good to ſet horſeleches to his backe / his legges & armes neare to his hādes.

                  A good drinke for the Quotidian or dayly feuer.
                theſame driueth away ye iaundis frō him / & alſo the whirling in the head. Wherfore ſaith Hipocrates: he yt maketh Miſceldē to pouder / & taketh it wt Aqua vite / theſame driueth awaye ye dayly feuer / or els ye iaundis / ye whirling in ye heade & the feuer Hectica / that is / aſatled feuer or ague / wherewith men do whyrle and be diſmade.
            The Tertiane or third dayes feuer commeth of the heat of the liuer / the Quartane or fourth dayes feuer cōmeth of Melancoly / ye colour of his vrine is like water and clere. But the colour of the Quotidiane or daylye feuer is moſt parte reed and clere. The colour of the Tertiane vrine is reed & thyck.
            Theſe vrines haue moſt part a litle ſome in the circle lyke Percely: But the ſome of the Tertiane / yt cōmeth of ye liuer / is ſomthing yalowe / becauſe it commeth of the heat of the gall. His mouth is bitter / and his face reed colored / his vrine is thinne. Anoynte his heade wyth oyle of Roſes and vinegre mixte together.
            This folowyng is alſo very good agaynſt ye dayly feuer: Take Euphorbium made to pouder the ſixtenth part of an vnce / tempered with an egges ſhell full of Aqua vite / geue the pacient this thre dayes together to drinke in the morning faſting: theſame purgeth the ſlyme / wherby the ague hath hys nourture. This ſlyme may be voyded of this wyſe alſo: Take the rote of an Elder tre / waſh it well & clene / then pare the vpper ſhell ſoftly from it / after ye ſhaue of yt other ſhell vntil ye wood or hardnes / a quarter of an vnce / bray yt ſmall / beat it wt an egges ſhell full of Aqua vite / & geue it ye paciēt. Or els ſeth of the inner ſhell or barcke of Elder tre a hand full in a quarte of ale or bier / till the halfe be ſodden awaye and drinke that / this is experimented.
            He that hangeth the roote of Valeriane grene at his necke / if ſhe waxe ſere / then goeth the ague from him.
            He that feareth / he ſhall get the ague / let him ſwalowe in thre cornes of Coriander faſtinge / and it ſhall go awaye: and let this be done before the ague fall vpon him.
            If he ſhall haue colde wyth it / then is it good alſo to take thre rootes of Veruayne / and thre leaues of it / ſodden in wine / and dronke before the cold do ouertake him / and he ſhalbe quit of it.
            He / whoſe feuer cōmeth of Melācoly / his vrine is firſt whyt / afterward black / when nature beginneth to digeſt. He yt hath this diſeaſe / let him eate freſhe meates / and purge him ſelfe twyſe euery weke wyth leaues of Sena tre made to pouder / and taken in the morninge and eueninge at eche tyme a quarter of an vnce wyth a peaſebroth. Geue him alſo to drinke of thys ſyroppe folowynge as ofte he will: Take a handfull of Cicory rootes / and a hande full of Cicorye floures / and two leaues of Hartes tounge / ſeth them wt a quarte of water tyll the third part be ſodden away: thē ſtreyne it

through a cloth into a pot / and put an vnce of ſuger thereto. Thys ſyrop is very good in ſommer / for it clenſeth the bloude / and ſlaketh thyrſte / and cooleth wel / it mollifieth alſo the harde matter / that is gathered about the hart of congeled bloud / wherof do ſomtyme grow apoſtemes or conſuming coughes: it driueth awaye iaundis alſo / and mollifyeth ſieges that a man maye the eaſyer haue thē. But if hys heade woulde ake / then geue him pilles that purge the heade / as pillule de iera picra / or pillule Cochie.
         
         
            ¶An approued ſcience for the ague / it riddeth a man oft in thre dayes.
            
               
                  An approued ſcience for the ague.
               TAke the rotes of Celendine / chappe them ſmall / and braye them whyle they be grene. Take as muche thereof as a walnut / ſteare them wyth a diſhe full of warme mylke or wyne / or wyth a diſhe full of warme peaſe broth: thys oughte to be done in the morninge faſtinge / and refrayne from eatynge and drinkinge / foure houres after: and if he can go / let hym walke vpon it. The nexte daye geue hym Diacartami / halfe an vnce or more: but if he hath greate heate / then geue hym Diaprunis laxatiui halfe an vnce or more / and if hys ſtrength can beare it / geue hym halfe an vnce Electuarij de ſucco roſarum.
            
               
                  Signes of an ague come of Flegma.
               If the feuer is come of Flegma / and the pacient is aged / and the ſeaſon drye / or yet colde and moyſt / and hys pulſe in hys arme beateth ſlackly / and hys vrine is muche and whyte / he alſo is greately thyrſtye: theſe are ſignes of the ague that commeth of Flegma. Geue to that pacient the iuyce of Clarye / the iuyce of Smalache / the iuyce of Fenell made lyke an Electuary. Let not the paciente eate nor drincke / whyle he hath colde or heate. After that geue hym a litle meat / that warmeth meaſurably: the nexte daye geue hym ſom meat good of digeſtion / as ſmall byrdes / and ſuche lyke / lette hys drinke be clene wyne. Or els geue hym Diacartami halfe an vnce or thre quarters.
            Item ſuppinges of Amilum made with cow milke / & a litle ſaffron comforte nature / & geue a good coloure / and ſtrengthen the pacient. Likewyſe maye ye make him Rice potage. If he is ſore cooled and febled / thē ſeth him a diſh full of Cumin / wyth a yolke of an egge / theſame maye he drinke colde or warme / that ſtrengtheneth hym very well.
         
         
            ¶For the Iaundis.
            HE that hath the iaundis / muſte beware of all meates or drinckes that coole him / for they hurte him. But if the iaundis doth greue him / then make hym thys drinke: Take a peny weight of beaten Saffron / and a penny weight of Ancolye beaten alſo / put them into a porenger or wyth vinegre / and ſteare them wel together / put alſo a litle wine and water to them / that it maye be thynne inough: then let it be dronke faſting / and it breaketh the iaundis withoute hurte.
            But if the diſeaſe woulde differre / and the iaundis woulde not voyde / wherby the paciēt could haue no ſtomake: if he be ſtronge inough geue him

Rebarbara made to pouder / temper it with a freſh Peaſebroth / and let him drinke it agaynſt the daye breake. If he hath ſtrength / then let him walke after it / and holde a toſted pece of bread before his mouth / and faſt two houres vpon it. Thys purgeth Colera an Flegma / whereof come the ague and the iaundis: or els wydeth it the ſtomake aboue / whereby the ſtomake is clenſed of ſlyme and the iaundis.
            But if he could not do it / or that it dyd yrke hym to take the Rebarbara / then geue hym halfe an vnce of Diaſene / the one halfe at nighte / the other halfe in the morninge / and let thys be beatē wyth a Peaſebroth / or els ſwalowed in wyth a roſted apple or ſoure thynge / theſame purgeth alſo.
            But if hys head dyd ake of colde / then anoynte hys heade / forheade and tempels wyth oyle of Camomille / and put into his noſe oleum benedictum / and a litle into hys eares alſo / and make him a fote bath with floures of Camomille / theſame chafeth the bloude and heade very well.
            But if he hath a moyſt heade / then cauſe him to niſe / and let hym take the roote of Piretrum / that is Walworte in hys mouth / and chawe it: the ſame draweth out the moyſtneſſe out of the heade / and geue hym Cinamō / Coriander / Zeduaria or Nutmegges to eate.
            It is good alſo / that he that hath a colde ague / which hath laſted longe / wherewith a man is greatly cooled / that he (I ſaye) be well anoynted the back / the loynes / and the belly wyth oyle of Bayes / and oyle of Iuniper of eche lyke muche agaynſte a good fyre / that it be well rubbed in.

            ¶An other proued ſcience for the ague / that hath laſted longe / ſpeciallye when a man hath gotten it of an euell ſtomake.
            
               TAke alſo the braunches of Elder / the former parte / pyll the vppermoſt ſhell ſofftely of / after that ſhaue of the grene / cut that ſmall / and braye it well in a morter / put as muche vinegre thereto / and braye it there with / ſtreyne it through a cloth in a glaſſe / and geue a patient thereof thre morninges faſtynge / at euery tyme a ſpounful to drinke / and let him faſte ſixe houres vpon it. Thys voyded the ſtomacke well of the agues occaſions.
            He that hath the diſeaſe that commeth of hote bloude / hys heade doth ake / he is hote and heauye / hys temples are ſwollen / and hys eyen ſtande forwarde. He is not thyrſtye / and in the night appeare before hys eyen read

thynges / hys pulſe is ſwyft / and in hys ſlepe do all his veynes beate ſore. He that is ſo diſeaſed / ought to be let bloud in the lyuer veyne in the arme / and the next in the right hande vpon the thombe in the veyne of the head / and the ſixt daye betwene the litle finger on the right hande in the harte veyne / and the nynth daye in both the fete without / aboue the ankles / nother muſt he let to muche bloud in any of the veynes. But it muſt be conſydered whether he hath ſtrength inough / whether the age is cōuenient for it / and whether the ſeaſon doth agre to it.
            If anye thynge ſhoulde hinder the letting of bloud / then muſt his bloud be cooled wyth theſe thynges / namely wyth water / wherein is ſodden Pſylium / that is Flewurt / and wyth a litle milke of Poppy ſede / this oughte to be geuen him to drincke. Geue him alſo a ſyrope of Violettes / and water / where in are ſodden black Cheries.
            But if his belly were to harde / then ought it to be mollifyed herewyth: Take Barly a good handfull brayed / and ſeth it in a pint of water / put ther to a litle butter / and a litle ſalte / and a litle Saunder / mixte wyth a litle ſuger / and geue him otherwhiles a ſlyce of bread / that hath ben ſtiped in that water: theſame mollifyeth his body and bloud / nother oughte he to drincke any other wyne / then that be ſower / and well mixte with barly water. Lay otherwhyles vpon his nauel butter / as bigge as a beane / and laye a thinne diſhe vpon theſame / tyll the butter be ſaked in. And if ſtrength can beare it / and that it doth not greue him / then geue him a purgacion with a confecte de ſucco roſarum / and geue him the night before ſyropes of Violettes / that he maye be mollifyed before / and he ſhall haue eaſy ſieges.
            But if he hath heade ake / then anoynt his heade herewyth: Take halfe an vnce of oyle of roſes / a quarter of an vnce of vinegre halfe a drame of Bolus armeny made to pouder / mixe them well together / and anoynt his forhead therewyth / and his temples and throte. Then take a diſh full of colde water / and put therein as muche vinegre / and wette a cloth therein / lyke a bande of thre fingers / wringe it out / and binde it about hys forhead & temples. And take two clothes / eche as bigge as a fyt / and wette them therein alſo / and geue hym alwayes one in hys hande / tyll it waxe drye. Wette yet two clothes therein / and binde them about his fete: and whē they are drye / then wet them agayne. This cooleth the bloud / draweth out the euell heat / whereof commeth the headake. But if the headake will not go awaye / nor aſwage / then marke by hys vrine and all hys beaucoure / whereof it commeth him / and vſe theſelfe toward hym / as is taught ſeuerally before of the head ake.
            It is to be noted / that if the head ake commeth of the ſtomake / then is he more diſquiet after meate then before: Him maye ye helpe of this wyſe: Purge hys ſtomacke wyth a laxatiue / after yt muſte he be meaſurable with eating and drinkinge / accordinge to his complexion. But if the headake be becauſe the pacientes braynes are to moyſt / then is he more vnquiet faſting then after meat. If the moyſtneſſe of the braynes is of colde / then geue him ſomthynge that warmeth the ſtomacke meaſurablye / and the pacient muſt beware of all thinges that coole / and muſt kepe hys head warme.

After that ſtreyne the water through a cloth / and kepe it. Of that water muſt the pacient drinke both daye and night when he is thyrſtye / ſaue onely whā he looketh for the ſhakinge: for then muſte he nether eate nor drinke / withoute great neceſſitie conſtrayne him. And when the water is fayled / then make more.
         
         
            ¶Howe a man ſhall behaue himſelfe that is thus diſeaſed.
            OF thys wyſe muſt he guide himſelfe that is diſeaſed of thys ſyckneſſe:
                  Hovve the diſeaſed of a Feuer ſhall behaue himſelfe.
                he muſt beware of cheſe / milke / porke and freſhe befe / of all fruyt new or olde. Let him eat potages made wyth Bethes / Spinage / Oetmeel / Barly / and alwaye put a fewe Almondes beaten thereto: on fleſh dayes a quarter of an Henne / or Chikens ſodden in water / with Percely / and foure leaues of Lettis. He muſt beware alſo for moyſt meates and ſurffettinge. On fiſhe dayes let him eate Crabbes or Perches / ſomtime an egge potched in water. Let him drinke no wine / without it be at meale tymes / and that ſoberly / and mixte with ye aforeſayd Barly water / or clene water / if the made water were agaynſt his ſtomake: but out of meal tyme let him drinke none other water nor wine / then the aforeſayd.
            When a man knoweth that he ſhall haue the ague / if it is at after none / then maye he eate ſomwhat in the morninge about ſixe of the clocke / and tary ſo / tyll the heat hath forſaken him. If it ſhall come before breakfaſt / then let him not eat / tyll the heat be paſt.
            Some agues there be / in the which it were good to let bloude after the third daye / accordinge to the pacientes ſtrength / and the ſeaſon.
            This is now ſpokē of the commune agues / and of the Tertiane or third dayes feuer / though there be many kindes of it.
            If a man hath vſed ſuche water / as is ſpoken of before / then let him beware of exceſſe of meate / and take faſtinge the herbe / or the herbe made to pouder / called Centaurea / in Engliſh Centory / the bigneſſe of a walnutt or cheſt nut / tempered wyth wine / and he maye drinke a litle wyne vpon it / to

tempere hys mouth of the bitterneſſe. And thus maye he remayne that day. In the morninge / and the two dayes folowyng / let him take thereof in the morning the bickneſſe of halfe a Walnutt / wyth thre leaues of Rue or herbe grace / and as much Triacle / as a peaſe / and muſte drinke vpon it water of Celendine / mixte with the water of whyte thyſtle / called in Latin / Carduus Marie / or els water of Celendine alone two vnces. After the thyrd daye let him take of the foreſayd pouder agayne / whether he be amended or not / and vſe it foure dayes continuallye / and behaue him ſelfe in dietinge / as is ſayd before: and it is to be hoped that he ſhall recouer / or els ſhall the agus turne to another kinde of feuer.

When ye knowe the houre of the aſſaultinge / then take of thys drinke folowynge: Take Fenel a handfull / thre or foure leaues of Wormwod / ſeth theſe in half a pint of wyne vpon a ſoft fyre / tyll the thyrd part be ſodden awaye. Then take it from the fyre / but let it remayne warme. And when a man perceyueth the aſſaultinge of the ague / then let him not reſte / but ether walke / or cauſe him be led wyth the armes. In the forſayd wyne ought to be put half an vnce of hony of Roſes / and then drinke a litle glaſſe full thereof / & walke and ſteare him ſelfe without ceaſynge / ſo long he can / ye if nede is wyth the ſtaye of other / ſo long tyll the colde miniſheth. Then let him lye doune / and be well warme couered / that he do euen ſweat / and ſlepe if he can / whiche he might happely do with werrineſſe and faintneſſe. When ye heate is gone then let him riſe / and take meate if he liſteth: if not / and that he thyrſteth / let him drinke of the forſayd water in the morning / and he ſhall amende / & get a ſtomake.
            Communely when men haue dronke the foreſaid drinke / then haue they the ague more feruently then before: but let no man be afrayed therfore / nor deſiſt / before he hath taken it fyue tymes. For he falleth to an amendement and lightening / ſaue the firſt daye / withoute he do miſguide himſelfe / as is ſayd before.
