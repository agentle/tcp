            ¶How a childe spake with an ymage of our lorde and ete with hym.
            A Certayne abbot there was vpon a tyme the whiche had many worshypfull mennes sones dwellynge with hym to be nortured & brought vp in his abbaye / amonge the whiche childern one specyaly he loued / whome oftentymes syngulerly he desyred and wolde haue with hym / and specyaly dyde enforme and teche hym to beware of

dyces and to kepe hym fro synne / & to vse hym to vertue and good lyuynge. Sothely the chylde toke good hede to the abbottes techyng / & after his wordes Innocently lyued / and euery daye at a certayne houre he toke his dyner. and wente in to the chirche to the aulter of oure blessyd lady. And there whan he had sayde our lady sawter / toke and yete his dyner that he had brought wyth hym / and this he vsed to do often tymes. Sothely on a tyme he made hym redy to ete there as he was wonte to do. & the ymage of the chylde Ihesu came downe from his moders lappe & sat wyth hym / Mekely they louyd to gyder / etynge to gyder. & spekynge to gyder and also many swete wordes were betwixt theym / And what someuer Ihesu taught the chylde. he promysid to doo / And in this samr wyse they dyde often tymes to gydre / ¶Sothely on a daye whan he came from suche a swete breke faste It happened he met wyth the abbot there as he dwelled wyth al. whiche asked hym where he had be so longe. and the childe answerd and sayde that he had ben wyth his good felowe / Thenne the abbot asked hym. who is that good felawe. He sayde agayne / come wyth me and I shall shewe hym to the. And brought the abbot in to the chirche and shewed hym the ymage of the chylde Ihesu / in the lappe of the ymage of oure blessyd lady / Trewely thenne sayde the abbot. the felawshyppe of hym is good. God defende that ony man sholde forbede the this felawshyppe / therfore

be treue to hym and loue hym well. Trewely the abbot thought that on the morowe he wolde wayte ye houre whan this childe after his custome wolde come to the same place / leste happely he hadde lyed lyke as chyldren vse to do. And on the morowe the chylde came as he vsed to doo to the same place / Whan he had sayd our lady sauter. he put his brede on his cappe and sayde to the ymage of the chylde Ihesu come hyder good felowe. and lete vs ete oure dyner to gyder. Thenne the ymage sayd to hym I wyll no more dyne wyth the For thou haste tolde ye abbot of me. and hast shewed to hym my secretes / Than the chyde answered agayne and sayd. The abbot asked me where I had be / And I wote not what I sholde haue sayde other wyse / but I sholde haue lyed: And often thou haste taught me that I sholde not lye in no wyse. Thenne sayd the ymage agayne. I wyll not come to the but thou wyll an other tyme come to me and dyne wyth me / Ryghte gladly sayd the chylde I wyl come to the and dyne wyth the / what daye that euer it please the / & than anone the ymage came downe to the chylde / Sothely the abbot aforsayde stode in a secrete place & behelde the ymage of our lorde Ihesu and ye childe and herde theyr wordes / And for Ioye gretely he began to wepe / And so stylly wente his waye. And after they had eten and spoken to gyder / the chylde went thens home / The abbot met wyth hym anone / and swetely spekynge to hym / clypped hym in

his armes and sayde. My swete soone where haste thou be so louge. And the childe sayde. For the loue of god fader aske me no more / For the other tyme that I tolde you my felowe was very wroth / And soo moche he was dyspleased that he wolde not come to me tyll I promysed hym that I wolde come and dyne wyth hym an other tyme / Thenne sayd the abbot to the childe. Aa therfore sone thou must come to his dyner / And the childe sayde yes fader / and that algate / Than sayde the abbot. And thou wylt do ony thynge for me. And for my loue praye thy felowe that I maye come also wyth the to that dyner. Gladdely syr sayde the childe. I wyll speke for you. and doo also as moche as I maye / And on the morowe this childe came agayne after his custome to the same place where the ymage of oure lady was / And the abbot preuely folowed after And stode in a secrete place as he dyde afore The childe not knowynge. Thenne the ymage of Ihesu came downe to the childe / And moche Ioye they had bytwene them. than the childe sayd to our lorde Ihesu Nowe good felowe here my tale yt I wyll telle the. yesterdaye my lorde ye abbot asked of me as he met wt me where I had be so longe. & I tolde hym al to gyder & how I must dyne wyth you. & whan he herde me saye this. he wept sore & prayed me hertely yt I shold pray to you for hym yt he myght also come wyth me to that dyner / Wherfore good felowe and mooste beloued now I praye you graunte me this / 

Than our lorde Ihesu sayde to the childe. The abbot is not redy to come to that dyner. But saye fo-hym yt he make hym redy as soone as he can to come to me on crystmasse daye / the whiche was than nyghe at honde. Than the abbot that stode by in a secrete place herynge this / for Ioye & gladnesse he-wept / & preuely wente awaye agayne. And aftwarde the childe came to hym / & tolde hym that he had sped his erande / & therfore the abbot gretely thanked hym. Sothely whan crystmasse day was come the abbot made a feste to all his brethern / & sange that same daye the hye masse / & serued also his gestes in his owne propre persone. Than came ye forsayd childe to ye abbot / & sayd to hym stylly in his ere. Syr it is tyme yt we go to our dyner aforsayd lest happely my felowe our lorde Ihesu cryste shlbe wrothe. Than sayd the same abbot to the chylde. ¶Thou sayst wel my sone. And I wolde not yt yo rue feloye sholde be wrothe for nothynge. Than ye forsayd abbot gladly conforted his gestes / & prayed them to be mery & sayd. This same chylde and I be called to an other feste. And now it is tyme that we go / wherfore I commende me you to our lorde Ihesu cryste / the whiche graunte you for his grete mercy to come to the same feste. Trewely the forsayd childe that same daye wold ete no thynge / for he wolde come fastynge to his good felowe our lorde Ihesu cryste. And whan the abbot & the forsayd childe were come to the same place they passed both

to gydre / and yelded vp theyr soules to god
