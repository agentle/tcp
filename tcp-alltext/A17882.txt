               SInce now those clouds, that lately ouer-cast
            Your Fame and Fortune, are disperst at last:
            And now since all to you fayre greetings make,
            Some out of loue, and some for pitties sake:
            Shall I but with a common stile salute
            Your new enlargement? or stand onely mute?
            I, to whose trust and care you durst commit
            Your pined health, when Arte despayr'd of it?

            Should I for all your ancient loue to me▪
            
            Endow'd with waighty fauours, silent be?
            Your merits, and my gratitude forbid
            That eyther should in Lethean Gulfe lye hid

            Then with light straynes of Musicke, made to moue
            Sweetly with the wide-spreading plumes of loue?
            These youth-borne Ayres then, prison'd in this Booke,
            VVhich in your Bowres much of their beeing tooke,
            Accept as a kinde offring from that hand
            VVhich ioyn'd with heart your vertue may command.
            VVho loue a sure friend as all good men doe,
            Since such you are, let those affect you to:
            And may the ioyes of that Crowne neuer end,
            That innocence doth pitty, and defend.—

               THE Apothecaries haue Bookes of Gold, whose leaues being opened are so light as that they are subiect to be shaken with the least breath, yet rightly handled, they serue both for ornament and use; such are light Ayres. But if any squeamish stomackes shall checke at two or three vaine Ditties in the end of this Booke, let them powre off the clearest, and leaue those as dregs in the bottome. How soeuer if they be but conferred with the Canterbury Tales of that venerable Poet Chaucer, they will then appeare toothsome enough. Some words are in these Bookes, which have beene cloathed in Musicke by others, and I am conten

Likewise you may finde here some three or foure Songs that haue beene published before, but for them I referre you to the Players Bill that is failed, Newly reuiued with Additions, for you shall finde all of them reformed eyther in Words or Notes. To be briefe, all these Songs are mine if you expresse them well, otherwise they are your owne, Farewell.
            
               Yours as you are his, THOMAS CAMPIAN.
