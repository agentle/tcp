               ¶ Peter was not greater then the other Apostles, by any aucthoritie geuen hym of Chryst.
               
                  THey saye that Peter was chefe of the Apostles, verely as Apelles was called chefe of painters for his excellent conning aboue other, euen so Peter may be called thefe of ye Apostles for his actiuitie ād boldnes aboue the other: but that Peter had any aucthoritie or rule ouer his bretheren & fellow apostles, is fals & cōtrary to the scriptur. Christ forbad it the last euen before his passion, ād in dyuerse times befor, and taught always the contrary, as I haue rehersed.
               Thou wylt saye: thou canst not see how there shuld be any good ordre in ye kingdom, where none weare Better then other, and where the superiour had not a lawe ād authoritie

to compell the inferyour with violē
                  ce. The world truly can se none other way to rule, then with violence. For there no mā absteyneth from euel / but for feare, because the loue of ryghtuousnes is not written in theyr hartes. And therfore the Popes kingdome is of thys worlde. For there one sorte are your Grace, your Holynesse, your fatherhod: An other, my lorde bisshop my Lorde Abbot, my Lord Priour / An other / master doctour / father, bachelar / master parson / master vicar, and at the last commeth in simple sir Iohan. And euery man reygneth ouer other wyth myght and haue euery ruler his pryson his iayler / hys chaynes / hys tormentes / euen so much as ye fryers obseruauntes obserue that rule, and cō
                  pell euery man eyther with violence aboue ye cruelnes of the heathē tiraūts, so yt what cometh ones in, maye neuer out for feare of tellyng tales out of scole. They rule ouer the bodye with violence and cōpell it whether the harte wyll or not, to obserue thinges of their owne making.
               But in the kyngdom of God it is contrarye. For ye spirite that bringeth thē thether maketh thē wyllyng & geueth thē luste vnto the lawe of God, & loue compelleth them to

worke / and loue maketh everye mans good and all that he can do, commune vnto hys neyghbours neade. And as every man is strōge in that kingdome, so loue compelleth him to take the weake by the hande / and to helpe him, and to take him, that can not goo vppon his shulders and beare him. And so to do seruice vnto ye weaker, is to beare rule in that kyngdome.
               And because Peter did excede the other apostles in fervēt service towarde his brethern, therfore is he called (not in the scripture but in the vse of speaking) the chefeste of the Apostles, and not that he had any dominiō ouer thē.

                     sōs ye peter was not ye greatest by any aucthoritie geuen hī of Chryste. yet Peter cam thither if he cam euer thyther: as Paule and many other. Had they not auctoritie to bynd and loose? Or els how did they conuerte the people? Peter was also an Apostle and went from place to place as Paule did, ād as Paule ordeyned Bysshopes in euerye place to teach the people, so no doubte dyd Peter. Why then might not those Bysshopes calenge auctoritie by Peter as well as they of Rome? they saye also in their owne legēdes that Peter had his seate ot Antioch first. Did he runne to Rome lyuyng no man behinde him to teach the people at Antioch? God forbyd. Why then myght not that Bysshop calenge Peters aucthoritie? They wyll haply say soner then proue it, that Peter dyed at Rome, ād therfore his auctoritie is greatest ther. Then by that rule christs power is no where so ful as at Hierusalem.

Whych is clene agaynst thē selues.paull is called to help For they say in their awne lawe in the presence of the superior, the power of the inferior ceaseth, and is none at all.

               Wherfore in that they ioyne Paule with Peter, and chalēge their superioritie as wel by ye auctoritie of Paule as of Peter, there they make Paule felow ād equall with peter. And thus it is false that Peter was

               Moreouer wt this terme Peters seate they iugle a pase (as wt infinite other) saying that Peters seate, is the chefe seat / but what Peters seat is that they tell you not For wyste ye that / ye shuld some perceaue that they lye. Peters seate is no stole or chayre (for what hath the kingdō of Christ to do wt such baggage) but, it is a spiritual thyng. Chryst sayth in the gospell Math. xxiij. The Scrybes and pharyzees syt on Moses seate. What was moses seat ther, a chayre

                  or the temple / or the churchs, or synagoge of the land? Nay verely▪ for moses came neuer there. But Moses seate was Moses lawe and doctrine. Euē so peters seate, is peters doctryne, ye gospell of christ wc peter taught. And the same doctrine is Peters keyes: so that peters seate, Peters keyes and Peters doctrine is all one thing Nowe is peters doctryne, Paules doctrine & the doctrine of all the .xij. Apostles in differently, for they taught all one thynge. Wherfore it followeth / that peters keyes, and peters seate, be the keyes and seate of Paule also, & of all the other .xij. Apostles and are nothing saue the gospell of Christ

And thus as Peters doctryne is no better then Paules but one thing, euen so Peters seate is no greter nor hier or holyer then y• sete of ye other .xij. Peters sete now is christes sete / Chrystes gospell on whych all the appostles sate & on whych this daie sitteth all they only that preache christ truly Uherfore as Antichrist preacheth not peters doctrine (which is christs gospell) so he sytteth not on peters sete / but on the sete of sathan whose vicar he is and on the sete of his owne lawes and ceremonyes and false doctryne wher vnto he compelleth all men wythe vyolence of swerde.
               Then he clame to purgatorye with the ladder of the sayde texte,Purgatori what so euer thou bindest in earth. &c. purgatorie sayeth he, is in earth: wherfore I am lorde ther to. Neuerthelesse as he can proue no purgatorye / so can he not proue that yf ther were any / it shuld be in the earth. It myght well be ī ye elemēte or sphere of fyre vnder ye mone as well as in the earth.

                  WHen the Bysshoppes and Abbottes and other greate Prelates had forsaken Chryste and hys lyuinge, and were fallen downe before the beast the vycar of Sathan, to receaue their kyngdome of hym / then the pope called together diuerse counsels of such holy apostles, and there concluded and made of euery opinion that semed proffitable / an artycle of ye fayth. If thou axe wher is the scriptur to proue it? They answere we be the church & can not erre, and therfore saye they,The churche cā not erre. what we conclude, though there be no scrypture to proue it / it is as true as the scriptur & of egall aucthoritie with the scrypture and must be beleued as well as the scryptur vnder payne of dampnation. For (say they) our truth dependeth not of the trueth of the scriptur that is, we be not true in our doynge because the Scrypture testifyeth vnto vs that we do truly: but contrary / the truth of the scripture (saye they) dependeth of vs, that is, the scrypture is true because that we admyt it and tell the that it is true▪ For howe couldest thou knowe that it were the scrypture except we told ye so? & therfore we nede no witnesse of the scrypture for that we do, it is ynough that we so say of our owne

head for we can not erre·
               Which reason is lyke as though yong monkes newly professed,A similitude. shuld com by the rules of their order & ordinaunces of their olde founders and wolde go about to kepe them: & the old cankered mōkes shuld call them backe vnto the corrupt and false maner that now is vsed, sayīg: ye er. Do only as we teach you / for your profession is to obey your Elders. According vnto the rules of our order and ordinaunces of our founder shal they saye: We can teache you none other, shall the old monkes say / nor cā ly vnto you, ye ought therfore to beleue vs and to do as we byd you. The yong monkes shall answere, we se that you ly, cleane cōtrary vnto all that is writē in our rules and ordinaunces. The old mōkes shal say ye can not vnderstande them except we expounde them vnto you / nother yet know y• they be your rules / excepte that ye beleue y• we can not lye vnto you. For how can ye knowe that these be your rules and ordynaūces / but as we your elders tell you so? Now whē we tell you that these be your rules ād ordinaunces howe can ye be sure vndoutedlye that it is so / excepte ye beleue vndoutedly that we can not lye? Wherfore

if ye wylbe sure yt they be your rules & ordenaunces / then ye must first beleue that we can not lye. Leue such imaginations & disputations therfore and laye your rules and ordinaūces out of youre hādes and loke no more on thē, for they make you erre And come and do as we tell you / and captiuate youre wyttes and beleue that we can not lyr vnto you, and that ye can not vnderstande your rules and ordynaunces. Euen so yf thou saye it is contrary to the scrypture: they āswere yt thou vnderstandeste it not / and that thou must captiue thy wytte ād beleue that though it seame neuer so cō
                  trary, yet it is not contrarye: no if they determe yt christ is not risen agayn & though ye scripture testyfy y• he is rysen againe / yet (say they) they be not cōtrary, if they be wisely vnderstande. Thou must beleue / say they, y• there is some other meaning in the scripture & y• no mā vnderstādeth it: but y• we say / whether wtout scripture or agaīst it / that must thou beleue that it is true.
               And thus because yt the scripture wolde not agre with them / they thrust it out of ye way fyrst, & shut vp the kingdome of heauen which is Christs gospel, with false

                  Hēry ye .v.Take an ensāple: the bysshops sent king Henrye the fyft out to conquere Fraunce. The cause was (sayth the chronicles) that the kynge went about to take theyr temporallyes from them. And therfore to bringe the kynge into an other imaginacyon, they monyed hym, and sent him into fraunce.
               When they had sent out the kyng, he cō
                  quered more then was theyr will and more

then they supposed possible for hym in so shorte space / and brought fraunce cleane vnder fete: so that oure prelates had much secrete busynes, to set it vp agayn, but what is impossyble vnto so great Gods?
               In kynge Henryes dayes the .vi. oure holy father of Rome made the bysshop of Wynchester a cardynall,Hēry ye .vi which went shortly after into fraunce to treate of a truce betwene Ingland & fraunce. And him mette a legate of Rome, a cardinall also: after which meating / Inglyshmen had euer the worse in fraunce, and theyr chefest fryende the duke of Burgayne forsoke them. For whē cardinalles & bysshops mete together, they haue their secrete counsell by them selues, wherin they conclude neyther what is good for Inglande, nor yet for fraunce, but what is best for our holy fathers proffytt to kepe him in hys state.
               When kynge Henry was of age, there was a maryage made betwene hym and ye earle of Arminackes doughter in Giā, wt the which shuld haue bene geuen manye castels and townes in Gian and a greate sō
                  me of money therto. But ye maryage was broken not without the secret workyng of oure prelates and dyspensation of our holye

father thou mayest be sure. And a mariage was made betwene hym and the kinges doughter of Cecyle, for which Ingland gaue vp the whole dukedom of Gyan and Earledom of Mayme / wherby we lost all Normandye, wherof they were the kaye. And besyde y•, the cōmunes gaue a, xv. & an half to

For our meyney were set in the forefronte and borders of spayne towarde Gaskayne: partly to kepe those parties, and partly to feare y• Gascaynes, & to kepe them at home whyle in the meane tyme the Spanyardes wan Nauerne.

How beit for all the losse of Nauerne ye frenchmen were yet able ynough to match Spayne, the Uenecians ād the Pope with all the Zwytzers that he coulde make: so yt there was yet no remedye but we must set on ye frēchmē also, if they shuld be brought out of Italy.
               Then pope Iuly wrote vnto hys deare sonne Thomas wolfse that he wold be as good / as louynge and as helpynge to holye church / as any Thomas euer was / seyng he was as able.the newe Thomas. Then the newe Thomas as glorious as the old / toke the mater in hā

And frenchmen were chrysten men / and pytie, yea and great synne also were it to sheade their bloud / and ye frenchkinge was the most chrysten kyng agayne. And thus was peace concluded and oure Inglyshmen or rather shepe came home against winter and lefte theyr fleces behynde them. Wherfore no smal number of them, whyle they sought them better raymente at home, were hanged for theyr laboure.
            
            
               ¶Why the kinges syster was turned vnto fraunce.
               WHen this peace was made, oure holye Cardynalles and Bysshoppes (as their olde Gyse is to calke and caste .xl▪ L. yea an hundred yeare before what is lyke to chaunce vnto theyr kingdome) considered how the Emperour y• now is, was moost like to be chosen Emperour after hys graundfather Maximilian / for

Maximilian had already obteyned of dyuerie of the ELECTOURS that is shulde so be.
               They cōsidered olso howe mightye he shuld be: first, Kyng of Spayn wt all that perteyneth therto, wc was wont to be v.vi or .vij. kyngdōs: then Duke of Burgoyne Earle of Flaūders, of Hollande / Zelande / and Braband, wyth all that parteine therto: then Emperour, ād hys brother Duke of Austrych / and hys sister quene of Hungrye. Wherfor thought our prelates, if we take not hede betymes / oure kyngdome is lyke to be troubled & we to be brought vnder the fete. For thys mā shalbe so myghty that he shall wt power take out of ye french kynges handes, out of the hādes of the Uenetians / and frō the Pope also, what soeuer parteyneth vnto the empyre / ād what soeuer belongeth vnto hys other kyngdōs and dommions therto. And then he wyll come to Rome and be crouned there, and so shall he ouerlooke our holye father and see what he doth. And then shall the olde heretykes ryse vp agayne & say that the Pope is Antichryste, and styrre vp agayne, and bryng to lyght that we haue hyd & brogh

               IN shorte space thereafter Thomas wolfse / now Cardinall and Legate a latere and greatlye desyrous to be Pope also / thought it exceading expedient / for his many secrete purposes to bring our Kyng and the Kyng of Fraunce that now is together: both to make a perpetual peace and amitie betwene them, and that (whyle the two kynges and their lordes dalyed together) the greate cardinalles and Bisshoppes of both parties, mighte becraye them both / and the Emperour and all Chrysten kinges therto.

               For frenchmen are not so folish to haue done it so vnaduisedlye and so rashlye / seynge they had to many in their toppes already.

but that God wyll vtter more practise by whome he wyll, & not cease, vntyll he haue broken the bande of the wytye hypocrytes / which persecute so subtylly.
               And fynally, let them remembre that I, to preuent all occasyons and all carnall beastes that seke fleshly lybertie, sent forth the true obedience of a Chrystē man wt yet they condempned, but after they had condēpned the newe testament, as ryght was, whence the obediēce had hys aucthorytie. Now thē if whē the lyght is come abroad in wc theyr wyckednesse can not be hyd, they fynde no such obedience in the people vnto theyr old tyranny, whose faute is it? This is a sure conclusyon: none obedience yt is not of loue can longe endure: and in your dedes can no man see any cause of loue: and the knoledge of Chryst, for whose sake onely a mā wold loue you, though ye were neuer so euell, yea persecute. Now then if any disobedience ryse / are ye not the cause therof youre selues?
               Saye not but that ye be warned.
