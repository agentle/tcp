Courtiers.
            
               
                  WOrthy gentlemen,
I cannot
conceiue what
more befitting
and fruitfull
Preſent may be offered vnto
you, than that which with an
apparent breuitie conteineth
in it the meanes how to compaſſe
and obteine that End,
which by ſeruice is deſired.

To which purpoſe hauing finiſhed
this preſent Diſcourſe, by
me named The Arte of the
Court, inperfection according
to the module of my conceits:
I giue it, and as I coniecture,
moſt iuſtly dedicate
the ſame vnto you: not, becauſe
either by vertue of a
long experience, or of an exact
iudgment, I make profeſsion
to be a Maſter in this Arte,
but to manifeſt, that by the
North guide-ſtar of methodicall
knowlege, a man may furrow
the deepeſt ſeas of vnknowen
diſcipline; and haply
far from the dangerous rocks
of reaſonable cenſures, arriue
at the Port of true and commendable

doctrine. If then
my 
                  〈◊〉
                herein miſgiue me
not, my deſired reward ſhall
be the profit you ſhall make of
it: but if any man thinke otherwiſe,
the way lies open, no
leſſe to the triall of his owne
knowledge, than (if he can)
to the correction of other
mens labours. Fare you
well From the Caſtle

            The Preface.
            
               IT is my intent
to make
triall if by the
waie of certeine
principles,
there may anie precepts
be eſtabliſhed, for the
inſtruction and inſtitution
of a woorthy Courtier: Not
to ſhew what vertues belong
vnto him, but, preſuppoſing
him alreadie to haue
that habit, which the Court
requireth, to teach him in
what maner he ſhould carry
himſelfe to run the courſe
of his ſeruice with happineſſe.

And becauſe multiplicitie
of words is toilſome
to the writer, and breedes
confuſion in the Readers
mind, I wil make my proof
                  •
               
with that breuitie, which
may exclude obſcuritie in
the vnderſtanding, and
yet lie very plaine vnto
indifferent capacities.

               CHAP. I.
What ſhould be the Courtiers
and or ſcope.
               
                  ALL Humane
actions haue
for their end
& ſcope ſome
good or benefit
of him who is
the actour of
them. The chiefeſt good principally
thirſted after by man is
happineſſe: For this, all actions
are done; which either mediatly
or immediatly regard the
ſame; ſo that euery Agent properlie
worketh for his owne
benefit. True it is, that many
times in the atchieuement of

                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
ſome deſired good being very
difficult, the helpe of another
is expedient, his owne forces
not baſtant or ſufficient. For
this cauſe, in the beginning,
were Societies inſtituted; in
the which if euery one ſhould
worke for his owne good, without
reſpecting that of his fellow;
doubtleſſe, they ſhould
be vaine and friutleſſe. Wherefore
in theſe, it is behooffull
not to worke for proper commoditie,
but for publike benefit;
for that in this maner euery
one as intereſſed, doe agree to
effect and facilize the obtaining
of that good which is deſired.
The end then of euery Society
is the common good of thoſe
who are comprehended therin.
               The reſpect and relation of
him that commandeth, towards
him that ſerueth, I dare not

call it a Societie; for ſuch is the
inequalitie of the termes, that
by many wiſe men the ſeruant is
held the Commanders inſtrument;
whereby it followeth,
that among them there is no other
end, than the good of the
maſter, knowing it to be cleere,
that we can not diſtinguiſh the
end of the inſtrument, from that
of the agent which mooues the
ſame. Heere-hence it followeth
further, that the Seruant
oweth all his actions (as a ſeruant)
vnto his Maſter, and the
Maſter nothing vnto his ſeruant;
and that therefore receiuing
any benefit from the commander
or Maſter, he is by far
more bound, than by ſeruing
he can oblige the other; ſince
in ſeruing he doth but the actions
of an inſtrument, the which
are to be acknowledged from

the agent, but in receiuing of a
benefit, he hath the ſame from
another as from an affected
cauſe: From the ſame principle
many excellent and important
conſequences might be deduced,
the which notwithſtanding
I will reſerue, as for a place
more fit, in that part of actiue
Philoſophie, which conteineth
precepts of Oeconomicall prudence.
               In the meane time wee ſay,
That not entreating heere of
naturall or violent ſeruitude, but
of voluntary and electiue ſeruice,
it ſeemeth, and not without
reaſon, it may pretend to haue
in ſome ſort the qualitie and nature
of a Societie, and that by
conſequence we may attribute
vnto it for the end thereof a
kinde of communion of good.
And certeinly that heerein the

ſeruice due to the Maſter is
moſt conſiderable, may be gathered
by what alreadie hath
beene ſayd, as alſo by weying
or iudging of their mutuall
bonds: for, if any demand
What is the ſeruants duetie or
bond, there is none I thinke
that will not anſwer, To ſerue
his lord and maſter: But on the
other ſide ſeeking what is the
Maſters dutie, we ſhall finde it,
To benefit the ſeruant according
to his merit. So that by this mutuall
obligation, theſe two
termes Maſter and Seruant are
vnited together in a ſocietie;
the which as hath already been
ſayd, hath for the end a common
profit. This granted, it
ſeemeth that the Maſters ſcope
or end is, the ſeruants benefit,
and that of the Seruant, the
Maſters ſeruice, ſince their duties

haue theſe references. And
if it be ſo, there groweth a
doubt how it may be verified,
that euery one worketh for his peculiar
profit, or that this is the
naturall inclination of euerie
man, and of all working things▪
But it is anſwered, that the ends
are of two ſorts, either deſired
or intended by themſelues, or
by accident and cauſed by another.
Whereby it followeth,
that two, which between themſelues
ſeeme contrary, may deſire
one thing without repugnancy,
as in this preſent caſe it
happeneth. For the ſeruant deſireth
for himſelfe, and worketh
for his proper benefit, mooued
vnto it by a naturall inſtinct:
but by accident, and for this
cauſe deſireth and worketh in
the ſeruice of his Lord, ſince
that from hence finallie hee

draweth the profit and commodity
which he longeth after;
whereby there is no contradiction
at all, that the ſeruant
ſhould haue for his end his proper
benefit, and withall the ſeruice
of his Maſter.
               Yet this doth not wholly reſolue
the propounded doubt,
becauſe it ſeemeth, that if the
true and principall end of the
ſeruant be his owne proper
commoditie, we might ſay that
his dutie were to worke, not for
his Maſters ſeruice, but for his
owne profit: and therefore this
is by euery man with great reaſon
reiected. Wherefore wee
ſay that a ſeruant may two
wayes be conſidered, either as
he is ſociable, or as he is aſſociated:
if as ſociable, without
doubt the end of his actions is
his proper benefit: if as aſſociated,

by the bond of duty which
bindes him, his End is the ſeruice
of his Maſter. Or if in other
termes, we wil ſay the ſame
thing, that is, that the ſeruant
hath two Ends or Reſpects, one
which moueth him to contra
                     •…
                  
this ſocietie, and this out of a
                     •…
                  
queſtion and reſolutely is his
proper benefit; the other is the
end of the ſocietie, and this
doubtleſſe is the commoditie
or ſeruice of the maſter, though
not disbanded or diſioyned
from the profit of the ſeruant,
by the participation that this
habitude or reſpect of ſocietie
hath betweene the Maſter and
the ſeruant, the which, as it is
ſaid, endeth alwaies in a common
profit.
               To conclude then, and to reſerue
that vnto another place,
which heere (as not ſo proper)

we will but briefly touch. We
ſay, That the end for the which
the Courtier voluntarilie ſubmits
his necke vnto the yoke of
ſeruitude, is his owne profit,
for the which as his end principally
intended, he both laboureth
and endureth much. But
his end, as a Courtier, obliged
in ſocietie and duetie of ſeruitude,
is the ſeruice of his Lord,
the which he vſeth as a meanes
vnto the former and more principall,
which is his proper benefit,
with the intercourſe of fauour
which followeth the actuall
ſeruice. For the Courtier
firſt of all longeth after his
owne profit; but not able otherwiſe
to compaſſe the ſame
than by the loue and fauour of
his Prince, he propoundeth his
ſeruice, and diligently working
therein, obteineth his fauour,

which breedeth his owne profit
and commoditie aboue all
other things by him deſired.
               It appeareth then that the
ends or ſcopes that the Courtier
hath are three, that is, his
proper intereſt, and this is that
which chiefly he endeuoureth:
next, the fauour of the Prince,
as the cauſe of his firſt end: and
then, the ſeruice of the Prince,
as the efficient cauſe of that fauour.
But becauſe theſe things
haue in themſelues ſome difficulties,
a larger declaration is
neceſſary.
            
            
               CHAP. II.
A declaration of the foreſaid
ends.
               
                  PRoper interest, Seruice, and
the Princes fauour are, as it
is ſaid, the Courtiers ends, of

the which his proper interest is
the firſt, and by it ſelfe deſired;
the others by accident and as
meanes. Now what is meant
by this terme fauour, is ſo manifeſt,
that it needs no other explication:
but thoſe of proper
intereſt, and the Princes ſeruice,
are not ſo well vnderſtood,
both the one & the other terme
conteining many things, vnto
the which (it may be) the end
and dutie of a Courtier doth
not extend.
               Let vs firſt then conſider the
Seruice, and ſay thus; There is
no doubt, but the Prince hath
diuers and many ſorts of men
which ſerue him; as the ſouldiers
in the war, the Magiſtrates
in time of peace, and thoſe
which in his houſe perform his
neceſſary buſineſſe. If all then
(as it is moſt plaine) are bound

to ſerue him, all their ends ſhall
be the ſeruice of the Prince: and
ſo if he be a Courtier whoſe end
is the Princes ſeruice, all thoſe
aboue named, and particularly
ſuch which are in actuall ſeruice
ſhould be Courtiers: but it
ſeemeth not only a new terme,
but withall, contrarie to common
ſenſe and the true ſignification
of the name of a Courtier,
to comprehend therein, the
Souldiers, the Iudges and other
Magiſtrates; wherfore we
can not ſay they are all Courtiers
which ſerue, but only ſome
of them, amongſt whom wee
can not denie thoſe to be held
for ſuch which priuately ſerue
him. So as it is fit to conſider
in the Prince two perſons, one
publike, which makes him to be
a Prince; the other priuate, by
the which we ſuppoſe him to be

the head of a familie, as by the
other (as a Prince) hee is head
of a Kingdome or Common-wealth.
Thoſe then who ſerue
him as a Prince, that is, in the
actions belonging to the publike
benefit, were neuer called
by the name of Courtiers; but
thoſe only who ſerue him priuatly,
and are comprehended
in his familie or Court. From
this principle, wee draw that
which at the firſt we ſought for,
that is, what things this ſeruice
conteineth; for that, from it
are wholly excluded all ciuill
ends and publike actions; on
the other part are receiued all
thoſe which the domeſtical buſineſſe
or that of the family requireth,
in ſuch ſort, that as the
Magiſtrate, in another place,
ſhall be by vs termed the Princes
inſtrument as a publike perſon,

ſo is the Courtier his inſtrument,
as the head and father
of a familie; ſo that all
works belonging to the charge
of houſholdrie are embraced
and conteined in his end as a
Courtier: and therefore when
we ſay his end to be the ſeruice
of the Prince, it is vnderſtood
(as wee haue ſayd) of all that
which exceeds not the limits of
houſhold affaires.
               Let vs now come to declare
what is vnderſtood by proper
interest. It can not be doubted
that this terme intereſt doth not
conteine all kinde of humane
good, though to this large
ſcope of ſignification, it ſeemeth
the common vſe thereof
hath extended it, but we ought
with reaſon to aduert the excluſion
of that good which cannot
be obtained from another: becauſe

in vain ſhould the Courtier
ſerue the Prince to that end,
to obteine from him that thing,
which neither he nor any other
could impart vnto him: as for
example are the vertues, which
in vaine are expected from any
other, than from our owne well
ordered and proper nature: ſo
that this good excluded, it ſeemeth
(and in this likewiſe the
vulgar opinion doth agree) that
for two things principally hee
doth take vpon him and vndergo
this ſeruitude; for profit and
for honour. Some ſerue for profit,
not eſteeming of honour, as
the mercenaries; others for honour
only, as the noble, either
by birth or greatneſſe of minde
and ſpirit; others both for the
one and the other.
               Well, let it be ſo that euery
man ſerueth for theſe two either

ioyntly or ſeuerally. Profit
particularly includeth in it riches,
the which are in abundance
of neceſſaries for our life;
as money, lands, cattell, moueables,
furniture for houſes, and
ſuch like. But by honour, is not
vnderſtood at all that which
followeth the actions or vertuous
qualities, ſince that this
good (as alreadie hath beene
ſayd) dependeth on our proper
election and facultie, and may
without others helpe be obteined;
for I thinke none of opinion,
that freely to vſe prudence,
fortitude, iuſtice or magnanimitie,
it is neceſſary to enter into
the Court of Princes; but there
rather to obteine degrees of
power and dignitie, which commonly
are called honours; or be
it that worthily by meanes of
vertuous actions they are attributed

as honor giuen in reward
of vertue; or becauſe, as they
ſay, Honour is the opinion held of
anothers vertue: by meanes
whereof they obtaine in the
world an opinion of merit, or
becauſe he that poſſeſſeth it, is
honoured. So that the honours
which are the Courtiers end,
are degrees, dignities, power,
wealth & the reputation, which
ſpring from them; and not the
whole compaſſe of honour. For
ſince the actions of vertue may
as wel be vſed out of the Court,
as hath beene declared, the honours
anſwerable thereunto
may alſo without being a
Courtier be in like
maner obteined.
            
            
               
               CHAP. III.
Of the choice of the Prince
to be ſerued.
               
                  OVt of theſe thing may
eaſilie be drawen a rule
which the Courtier is to obſerue
in the election of the Prince to
whom he is to dedicate his ſeruice;
the which requireth great
conſideration, for the inconueniences
which otherwiſe may
follow: becauſe if in this an error
be committed, it is cleerely
impoſſible euer to obteine the
end for which he ſerues; wherby
vaine is the labor he ſhall afterwards
vndertake in ſeruice,
falſe his hope of reward, vnprofitable
his repentance, and the
amendment very dangerous:
for that vnto the eaſie change
of Maſters followeth a conceit
of lightneſſe, & a difficulty not

happely to be new placed, by
reaſon of the impediments oppoſed,
either by the authoritie
and power of the abandoned
Prince, or by the foreſaid opinion
of inſtabilitie, or hard to
be contented, or of arrogancie
according as the cauſe of the
change may be variably reported
or beleeued: the which
happening by reaſon of the
Princes diſcharge or caſting off,
can not bee for the moſt part
without a great ſtaine or blot
vnto the Courtier. Wherefore
it is very neceſſary to be carefull
that this election ſhould bee
wiſely made, and it ſhalbe ſuch,
when the Prince which is choſen
may giue cauſe vnto the
Courtier of that end, which principally
he pretendeth aboue all
others. But to make a perfect
iudgement heerein, wee muſt

conſider the qualitie of the intended
end, and the ability and
proportion which the Prince
beareth to the ſame.
               The Courtiers end hath alredie
beene ſaid to be his propt
commoditie, that is, his profit and
honour. And becauſe there is
no limitation in deſired ends,
which are (as they ſay) infinite,
whereupon the Merchant coueteth
an infinite gaine, and the
Captaine a moſt ſingular victorie,
ſo no leſſe doth the Courtier
deſire a profit without end
and honour in the higheſt degree
that may be obteined.
               The Princes abilitie conſiſteth
in power and will, they had
wont to ioyne thereunto knowledge;
but in this affaire it hath
ſo little part, that without error
it may be let paſſe. Wee muſt
then examine his ability and his

                  willingnes, diligently beholding
what proportion they holde
with the forſaid ends, and if we
know them to haue proportion
vpon an effectiue cauſe, moſt
aſſuredly it ſhall bee good to
make choice of ſuch a Prince:
and to ſpeake more plainly, I
ſay, that if propounding any
profit, there ſhall be any Prince
that both can and will impart
the ſame vnto the Courtier, he
is the moſt worthie whom hee
ſhould ſerue. In like ſort may
wee reaſon of the other end,
which is honor, aduertizing, that
the Courtier either by himſelfe,
or by meanes of ſome other
who haue greater and more inward
knowledge than he, may
learne if theſe two principals,
that is, Power and Will to benefit,
be truly in the Prince, whoſe
power may eaſilie bee vnderſtood,

as a thing for the moſ
                     •
                  
part commonly knowen, an
                     •
                  
muſt be conſidered not onel
                     •
                  
immediatly, as proper in himſelfe,
but mediatly and by othe
                     •
                  
helps; for that, if by himſelf
                     •
                  
he can not performe much, b
                     •…
                  
by his authority be able, ſo that
by meanes of him it ſhalbe lawfull
for the Courtier to hope for
his deſired end, we may iuſt
                     •…
                  
ſay that he is able: but if neithe
                     •
                  
by himſelfe nor by meanes o
                     •
                  
another he be able, in vaine
                     •…
                  
the ſeruice that ſhall be vndertaken
with him.
               The Will is yet harder to be
knowen, the which by nature 
                     〈◊〉
                  
ouerſhadowed with many vales
howbeit, it is diſcoured an
                     •
                  
vnmaskt by due obſeruation o
                     •
                  
the effects: for if the Prince be
accuſtomed to bee beneficiall
and ſeemeth inclined thereunto,

we may ſuppoſe an habit of
beneficence, which wanting, he
is aſſuredly incaple of honourable
ſeruice. But in this particular
we muſt conſider a diuiſion,
becauſe ſome Princes are
not of a beneficent and liberall
nature towards their ſeruants;
others are, but much more with
their ſeruants, to whom by merit
of their ſeruice they thinke
themſelues in ſome ſort bound.
The illiberall niggardly and abſolute
not beneficiall, are vnworthie
of life, ſince they liue
vnprofitably in this humane ſocietie,
wherein nothing is required
more neceſſarilie, than beneficence
and liberalitie; ſuch
Princes towards their ſeruants
are not woorthily enabled for
the ſeruice of the Courtier inſtructed
in this arte; wherefore
for the moſt part they are ſerued

with mercenarie people
without ſpirit or feeling of honour,
and to conclude, worthy
of them.
               Amongſt thoſe who are beneficiall
towards their ſeruants,
there are ſome, who ſparingly
and with hardneſſe grant their
benefits and fauours, not becauſe
they doe not loue the
good of their ſeruants, but
doubting leſt hauing profited
them, they ſhould abuſe their
fauors, or ſuſpecting leſt ſhewing
themſelues too gentle, they
ſhould grow too confident and
ſecure. With theſe kinde of
Princes a man may with commendations
contract ſeruice,
but how he is to proceed to obteine
theſe fauours ſhall be fully
declared in his place. Some others
there are, who by benignitie
of nature moſt eaſily encline

to benefit and to doe fauors,
who notwithſtanding very
conſideratly and with a iuſt
proportion diſpence and diuide
the ſame; and theſe are
thoſe who aboue all the reſt deſerue
the ſeruice of the moſt
honourable and accompliſhed
Courtiers: wherfore vpon theſe
doth fall the wiſe election, as of
Princes or Lords, from whoſe
magnanimitie, by meanes of
ſeruice, there is in all reaſon
hope to obteine their deſired
profit and reputation.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII.
That the Courtier muſt conceale
the endeuor of his proper commoditie
vnder the apparent deſire
of the Princes ſeruice.
               BVt to returne to the Courtiers
end, and to ſpeake of

ſome things woorthie ſpeciall
confideration, you are to vnderſtand,
that the end, by it
owne nature, hath a deſire in it
ſelfe to moue and induce an operation
or working; wherfore
labouring in fauour thereof,
thoſe are iudged prouident and
wiſe, who are ſeene to take a
good way proportionate and
apt for the obtaining and compaſſing
of the ſame. But in the
particular of a Courtier this rule
faileth, ſince it is not ſufficient
that the actions be wiſe and diſcreet,
which manifeſtly appeare
to tend to his end, that is, his
proper interest; but thoſe alſo
which ſeeme to belong to the
profit and ſeruice of the Prince:
and the reaſon is, becauſe the
Courtier is not to expect benefit,
without the loue and fauor
of the Prince, which ſhall neuer

be obteined if he diſcouer his
intereſſed ſeruice, ſince ſuch
kinde of Courtiers are eſteemed
as mercenaries, and more ſelfe-friends
than their Maſters; who
ſuppoſing that the Societie
which they holde with their ſeruant
ſhould tend to their profit,
take it for an iniurie vnto them,
whileſt peruerting the order,
another end is preferred, which
by accident (in their opinion)
ſhould bee deſired. This part
was excellently wel vnderſtood
of a great Courtier of whom
manie and verie conſiderable
obſeruations are read in Cornelius
Tacitus,
                  Ann. 4. who cauſeth Seianus
thus to ſpeake: Fulgorem
honorum à ſe nunquam praelatum,
excubias ac labores, vt vnum ex
militibus pro incolumitate Imperatoris,
malie: Hee neuer layd
before him bright ſhining honours,

but wiſht rather watchings
and labours as one of the
common ſouldiers for the Emperours
ſafetie. And Tigillinus
ſaith:Idem 14. 
                  Non se vt Burrhum diuerſas
ſpes, ſed ſolùm incolumitatem
Neronis ſpectare: Hee had not
diuers hopes like Burrhus, but
reſpected the onely health of
Nero. This man in his time was
likewiſe in great fauour, and by
his arte ſurpaſt and ouercame
all his concurrents. In ſumme,
this aduertiſement is ſo neceſſary,
that taking any other courſe,
all hope of euer being fortunate
in Court is cut off: wherefore
he muſt not only make profeſſion
in words, but with effects
make perfect ſhew to haue no
other intereſt than the abſolute
ſeruice of his lord: which to do
we will now teach the meanes.
               The ſcope of the Courtier is

his proper interest, that of the
Prince, is his profit. Amongſt
the actions which the Courtier
can performe, ſome reſpect only
his proper intereſt, ſome the
ſeruice and commoditie of the
Prince, and ſome are common
to both. Of thoſe reſpecting
the proper intereſt, ſome are
contrary to the Princes ſeruice,
ſome not: likewiſe, of thoſe reſpecting
the Princes profit,
ſome are repugnant and contrarie
to the Courtiers good,
others not. Now, ſeeking in
what maner by meanes of our
labour, wee may conceale the
deſire of our proper intereſt,
with an apparent will of the
Princes ſeruice; we ſay, firſt it is
neceſſary that we who wholly
abſtaine from thoſe actions
which behold our proper commoditie
to the preiudice of the

Prince. It is alſo neceſſarie (although
it ſhould not be ſo great
an error to do the contrarie) to
beware to doe any thing which
immediatly reſpecteth our proper
good. And of all this the
reaſon is cleere enough by what
hath beene ſayd before.
               Thoſe actions now which are
common to the end, both of the
one & the other, are not greatly
hurtfull nor profitable to the
Courtiers intention: but thoſe
actions are profitable which regard
the Princes commoditie,
and eſpecially thoſe which ſeem
to conteine any danger or damage
to the ſeruant. Amongſt
thoſe of greateſt importance to
maske the appetite of our proper
commoditie, are thoſe
which are wrought in benefit of
the Prince with great danger
and detriment of things moſt

deere. But we muſt note heere,
that the end of the Courtier being
double, that is, of profit and
reputation; in that of honor or
reputation we muſt haue ſpeciall
conſideration and regard,
becauſe it ſhalbe an action moſt
commendable in a Courtier (as
a Courtier) to deſpiſe or refuſe
ſome honour or dignitie to
continue in the ſeruice of his
Prince; and in this ſort to ſuffer
a damage, is a thing to be deſired;
but withall it ſhould not be
commendable, if for any reſpect
of his Lord he ſhould ſuffer
any blot or ſtaine in his reputation:
for that is a thing
which amongſt men ought to
be preferred (as commonly it
is) yea before life it ſelfe. But
in that which belongeth to the
profit and good ſeruice of the
Prince, he may ſecurely make

any loſſe, the which by how
much either in aduenture or in
effect it ſhall be greater, by ſo
much the more doth it anſwer
to courtly wiſdome. And becauſe
vnder the name of profit
I meane the goods which may
be giuen or taken, and in deed
all are termed actions of this
kinde (vertue and honour excepted)
as when for the honor
of his Prince he ſpendeth liberally;
when hee aduentureth
friends and kindred; when hee
leaueth his owne pleaſures, and
many times his neceſſary commodities
of liuing or of healthfull
liuing, as meat, reſt, ſleepe
and ſuch like, ſo farre as nature
will ſuffer, to preferre the ſeruice
and execute his Princes
commandement, and aboue
all, when he expoſeth his life to
danger for the honour, ſafetie,

and pleaſure of his Prince.
               
                  Cornelius Tacitus an excellent
Maſter of Courtiers, with
an example of Seianus, moſt
plainly teacheth all that hitherto
hath beene ſpoken to this
purpoſe: becauſe whileſt Tiberius
was yet in doubt how farre
hee might haue confidence in
Seianus, againſt whom manie
things were muttered:Ann. 4. 
                  Fortè,
inquit, illis diebus oblatum Caeſaeri
anceps periculum auxit vana rumoris,
praebuit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ipſi materiam,
cur amicitiae conſtantiae
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Seiani
magis fideret: By chance, ſayth
he, in thoſe dayes a doubtfull
perill being offered vnto Caeſar,
encreaſed the vaine report,
and gaue matter why he ſhould
be more cōfident in the friendſhip
and conſtancy of Seianus.
Then ſhewing the fall of the
grott wherin Tiberius banketed,

                  eius os lapſis repentè ſaxis obruit
quoſdam miniſtros, hinc metus in
omnes, & fuga eorum qui conuiuium
celebrabant; at the mouth
whereof certeine ſtones falling
downe, ſlew ſome of the ſeruitors,
wherupon all fearing, thoſe
that prepared the banket fled.
But Seianus, borne to obteine,
and (as it were) to impatroniſe
himſelfe in his Princes fauour,
genu, vultu
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      & manibus ſuper
Caeſarem ſuſpenſas oppoſuit ſe incidentibus,
with knees, face and
handes ouer-panching Caeſar,
oppoſed himſelfe againſt the
imminent ruines. This then is
one of thoſe actions which we
before haue pointed at, and is
by the circumſtances in the
higheſt degree, aſwell, happening
ſo great a danger of life, as
that the remedie was immediatly
taken, and that without

any premeditated diſcourſe;
wherby was perceiued a minde
moſt readie and well diſpoſed
towards the Prince: becauſe it
ſeemed that by a ſtrong motion
of nature it ſelfe well inclined,
a worke of ſo great ſafetie to his
Lord was performed. Wherefore
worthily followed the reward
which the ſame Authour
adioyneth: Maior ex eo, &
quamuis exitioſa ſuaderet; vt
non ſui anxius, cum fide audiebatur:
He grew greater heereby,
and although hee ſhould perſwade
dangerous matters, they
were yet faithfully heard, as
from one not reſpecting himſelfe.
Where theſe words are
of eſpeciall note: vt non ſui anxius,
as not reſpecting or careleſſe
of himſelfe: becauſe they
confirme the principle of hiding
the appetite of our proper

intereſt, vnder the vale of
apparent deſire to do the Prince
ſeruice. Such then is the drift
or end of the Courtier, and as
hath beene declared muſt be
couertly or ouertly deſired, if he
will induce the Prince to accept
of his ſeruice, and make a paſſage
for the obteining of fauour,
by meanes whereof he winneth
the poſſeſſion both of profit and
honor; marks which in his principall
intention hee chieflie aimeth
at.
            
            
               CHAP. V.
Of the Courtiers office or duty.
               ALl thoſe deſſeignes which
men purpoſe, are to be
compaſſed by action or endeuour,
the end being firſt duly
conſidered, that courſe or action
which is taken for the obteining

thereof, is the office of
the agent: wherefore the Courtier
being bound (as a Courtier)
to haue immediatly in his
intention, and withall to procure,
the Princes ſeruice; it is
manifeſt that the action which
he purpoſeth to do, is, to ſerue;
not in ſhew and in will, but effectually
and in act: and this is
ſo true, that according to the
quantitie and qualitie of ſuch
operation, the fauour in proportion
is anſwerable, which is
the mediate reward of ſeruice;
and the Prince which equallie
diuideth the ſame, ought to
meaſure it by the rule of merit,
the which (as it is ſaid) groweth
from actuall ſeruice, in ſuch
wiſe, that who moſt ſerueth,
meriteth moſt fauour, and
who leſſe, leſſe reward. This
is Courtly right, or law: as the

right or law politike and ciuill
is founded vpon merit in the
Common-wealth, that is, of benefits
done vnto his countrey,
which deſert is recompenſed according
to diſtributiue iuſtice,
whoſe rule is (as in the morals it
is taught) Geometricall proportion:
but to ſpeake more fitly to
the common capacitie, we ſay,
that the axiom or ground being
true, That moſt is due to him that
ſerueth moſt, and leſſe to the leſſe
ſeruing, and nothing at all to him
who actually is not in ſeruice; it
followeth, that they are greatly
deceiued, who thinke with nobilitie
only, with abundance of
wealth, ſingularitie in learning,
armes, or ſuch like, to merit
more than thoſe vnto whom in
reſpect of ſeruice, they are farre
inferiors; becauſe the reward of
the Court (as hath beene ſayd)

muſt be proportioned as from
the efficient cauſe from whence
it groweth, vnto the actuall ſeruice.
For as if you were to make
choice of a Captaine to vndertake
ſome dangerous enterpriſe,
their pretention ſhould
be very vaine, that would perſwade
themſelues, either for
their beauty of body, learning,
wealth or nobilitie, to be preferred
in choice, before the
more experienced and practiſed
in matters of warre, though
leſſe learned, and inferior vnto
them in other qualities: the
like opinion is held of thoſe
who in Court pretend greater
deſert, for ſuch like reſpects,
whileſt others in diligence of
ſeruice go farre beyond them,
becauſe Courtly deſert is not
brought into the Court, but is
neceſſarilie to bee ſought for

there, and is by labour obteined:
which labour properly of
the Courtier is to ſerue. I ſay
not now, that a learned Courtier
is not of qualitie greater and
more eſtimable than an ignorant,
and a noble man than a
plebean, although in ſeruice;
but I ſay, theſe are qualities,
which not put in practiſe or exerciſed
in the Princes ſeruice,
reape no reward with him, they
cauſe indeed a precedencie of
one man before another, as
members of a ciuill ſocietie, but
not as Courtiers. So likewiſe,
if (for example) we conſider of
one nobly borne in compariſon
of a vulgar perſon, it is moſt
cleere he is of greater eſtimation,
as a man and part of the Citie;
but if wee peize and compare
them as ſouldiers, wherin,
it may be, the ignoble is more

practiſed and better diſpoſed
(ſuppoſing at leaſt it bee ſo)
without all doubt hee ſhall be
preferred, and the noble man
pretending the contrary ſhould
take a vaine and vndue exception.
               But heere we muſt not let
paſse a difficulty, occaſioned by
common obſeruance, and iuſtly
commended of all: that is, let
vs ſuppoſe two in the Princes
houſhold, whereof one far excelles
in nobility, learning and
other like qualities, but little
imploied in ſeruice; the other
much inferiour vnto this: It is
thought fit by all, that the more
noble & qualified ſhould more
honourably bee entertained:
wherfore we ſee him ſometimes
honored by the Prince at his table,
receiueth greater commodities,
of lodgings, of ſeruants,

precedency in place, in title, in
ſtanding couered and in complement;
in fine, the Princes
reſpect of him in eſtimation is
very conueniently more then
of the other, whereupon wee
may doubt, how this may be an
effect of Courtlie iuſtice, or
how the foundation of deſert
ſhould be ſeruice. Whereunto
we anſwer thus; he who is comprehended
in the Princes houſholde
may two waies be conſidered,
either as ſuch a man with
ſuch conditions and qualities,
or as a Courtier only. If only
as a Courtier, I ſay it ſhalbe iniuſtice
to him who ſerueth more
to be leſſe rewarded, or but in
equall liberality with him, who
in actuall ſeruice was his inferiour.
If as ſuch a man and ſo
qualified, it is very reaſonable,
that who excelleth in good

parts eſteemed of in common

                     •
                  ociety, ſhould be had in greater
accompt and reputation.
But there reſteth a doubt if we
ſhal preferre one conſideration
before an other, and that when,
and in what things: for that we
ſee many times the conſideration
of one as qualified to bee
preferred before the other, as a
Courtier, & therefore although
he ſerue leſſe, is not withſtanding
in better place. We ſee
alſo on the other ſide, that the
beſt qualified in ſome things
ſtand farre inferiour, to the better
and diligent ſeruing Courtier.
For, ſpeaking of fauours
(for the moſt part) the beſt beloued
obtaine them, and thoſe
are, the diligent carefull in ſeruice,
they haue greater authoritie
with the Miniſters of the
Court, and of the houſholde

affaires of the Prince, yea and of
the publike alſo, reſpecting the
power of a Courtier-fauorite, &
the recompence with profit and
dignity, preſuppoſing their abilities,
which ordinarily & without
compare is more large towardes
them. And ſurely the
name of Minion, or Priuado,
which we ſee commonly attributed
to thoſe greatly fauoured
in the Court, is not obtained by
the beſt learned, by the greateſt
captains, the moſt noble, or the
happieſt in fortunes bleſſings;
but by thoſe who in their Princes
ſeruice are moſt readie. So
we ſee Seianus preferred in fauour
with Tiberius, and with
greater liberality rewarded then
any other that ſerued at that
time; albeit we may ſafely beleeue,
there were many, in many
other things that did ſurpaſſe

him. And alſo thoſe Pallanti-Narciſi,
and Caliſti with Claudius
and Tigillinus about Nero,
were not ſo farre in authority
and fauour aboue others, as vnto
an infinite number of thoſe
times, they were without all
compariſon moſt inferior in all
other good qualities.
               Wherefore we ſay that the
benefits which the Prince doth,
are of two ſorts, one which he
beſtoweth amongſt his ſeruants
anſwerable to their qualities, as
men in that kind enabled; theſe
benefits are apparent and doe
not grow vpon any Courtly deſert
of thoſe on whom they are
beſtowed, but vpon the loue
and fauour of the giuer; which
is plaine, becauſe they are beſtowed
in the beginning of ſeruice,
when we cannot ſay there
was any deſert before, & might

aſwell haue beene granted before
any ſeruice, and it may be
greater. The other kind of benefit,
is that which is giuen to
thoſe, who with great diligence
haue ſerued; and theſe are not
granted but after ſeruice begun,
and are augmented as the fauor
by ſeruice doth encreaſe, which
makes vs attaine ſometimes to
that pitch of grace that Seianus
did,Ann. 4. 
                  qui varijs artibus Tiberium
deuinxit adeo, vt obſcurum aduerſum
alios, ſibi vni incautum
intectúmque efficeret; who by
ſundry wiles had ſo bewitched
Tiberius, that being cloſe to all
others, to him alone hee had
him open and vncircumſpect.
But that which more importeth,
he came to that height of
fauor, that in the iourney which
hee made with Tiberius out of
the city, the Senators, non modò

aram clementiae, aram amicitiae, ſed
effigies quoque circum Caeſaris &
Seiani cenſuere; not only erected
an altar of Clemencie and
another of Friendſhip, but
thought meet to place the images
of Caeſar and Seianus about
them. Neither ſtayed hee
heere, crebris precibus efflagitabant,
viſendi ſui copiam facerent,
moſt earneſtly intreating they
might haue the fauour to behold
him, vſing the ſeruant as
fellow with the Prince; but
more, that which ſeeemes incredible,
he durſt hope for, yea,
and in ſcorne of wonder obteined
in marriage the widowe,
daughter in law to his Lord.
Neither, it may be, is it of leſſe
conſideration with the ſame
Authour, that, which a principall
man of the Senate, called in
queſtion for his friendſhip with

                  Seianus ſhould ſay (amongſt other
things) in his excuſe, being
fallen vnto a miſerable end
through the whirle of fortunes
rouling wheele; Etiam Satrium
atque Pomponium venerabamur,
wee did likewiſe Court
Satrius and Pomponius; neither
did this ſuffice, libertis quoque
ac Ianitoribus eius noteſcere pro
magnifico accipiebatur; to bee
knowen to his freed-men and
doore-keepers we accompted a
ſpeciall grace. He ſaieth not to
be deere to them or in fauour,
but noteſcerre, that they would
take notice of them: neither
doth he ſay that it was neceſſary
or profitable, but, pro magnifico
accipiebatur, as a high and
ſpeciall grace. At that time it
was a reputation and credit vnto
the Senators of Rome, not as
then hauing altogether loſt the

brightneſſe of their place, to be
knowen to Seianus freed-men
and doore-keepers: To ſuch
degree of ſtate ſometimes doth
fortune heaue a circumſpect &
prouident Courtier, by means
of his place woorthily performed,
vnto which pitch of
height, it is not recorded that
euer any attained by fauour or
recompence of his Lord who
did not ſerue, but by ſome other
way of merit liued in the
Court. Wherefore wee muſt
conclude that the office and
duty of a Courtier is actually to
ſerue, and that this is the action
wherewith oftentimes hee
becommeth not onely
poſſeſſor, but diſpenſor
too of the fauour
of his
Lord.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VI.
If in all things the Courtier be
bound to ſerue his
Prince.
               BVt to the intent it may the
better be vnderſtood what
hitherto hath beene ſpoken of
the office and duty of a Courtier,
& that euery man may know
within what bounds the duty of
him that ſerueth is confined,
and what things his office a
                     ••
                  
bond embraceth, whereupon
alſo the reſolution of many
things dependeth; it is very
neceſſary to be vnderſtood of
the Courtier to whom it belongeth
actually to ſerue his
Prince, (as already is concluded)
be therefore bound to ſerue in
all things without exception.
               For cleering of this doubt,
ſifted and diſcuſſed by many,

me thinks, very many effectuall
things may be ſaid, neither
ſpoken of nor heard of heeretofore,
wherin we will proceed
briefly and ſo farre as the vnproperty
of the place will permit,
in this manner.
               If it were poſſible without
externall helpe to obtaine humane
felicity, ſo that euery man
by himſelfe, were of ſufficiency
to compaſſe it, Societies
                  
                     •
                  ould bee ſuperfluous: but

                     〈◊〉
                   this is impoſſible, it hath
beene thought neceſſary, not
only to inſtitute them, but with
all to make them the more effectuall,
fruitfull and firme, to
giue them ability and vertue, to
binde all thoſe that are comprehended
in them, to performe
and act ſome thing woorthy
thereof, in ſuch ſort, that euery
aſſociate, (as ſuch an one) is

bound to endeuour himſelfe to
that end whereunto the ſociety
tendeth: and that this is true,
there is no Society found without
Bond, nor Bond without Society,
either reall or rationall,
that is, with tearmes and fellowes
really and apparent, or
at leaſt diſtinct in works of the
minde and vnderſtanding, as
more plainly we will ſet downe
in the actiue Philoſophie, which
is the proper place. Wherefore
the bond or duty, is not other
thing then the habitude reſpect
or cuſtome which the aſſociats
haue together, which is an impulſiue
beginning to labour for
their common good, as their
only end. The labour or working
which doth grow heereupon
is called the office or duty
of the aſſociats, the which duty
in fine, is no other thing then an

actiō ſpringing from that bond,
although this word, bond, is attributed
alſo vnto the action, ſo
that in ſaying he doth his duty,
bond or office, it hath all one
ſignification. Now it is cleere
that this duty hath a proportion
with the End, becauſe that is
the cauſe of the working, and
therefore from it, it receiueth
the rule, order and moderation,
which ought to bee ſuch
as the end propoſed requireth.
Wherefore he doth his duty
who worketh proportionably
to the end ſet downe, and hee
who doth actions preiudiciall
to ſuch end, doth the contrary.
But he doth more then his duty
who doth things comprehending
the end and more: and he
leſſe, who doth things that in
their owne nature, are not anſwerable
to the deſtinated End,
                  
or leaueth many things vndon,
which to the obtaining of the
purpoſed end are very neceſſary.
Whereupon, both duty
and bond, as hath beene ſaid,
being all one, euery aſſociate is
bound to labour and indeuor
for the end intended by the ſociety
wherein he is, and who
doth leſſe, anſwereth not his duty,
and who doth more, is ſaid
to exceede in duty and is commendable,
ſo it doth not preiudice
the ſociety in any ſort:
who doth any action not belonging
to the End, worketh
idly and in vaine, but who doth
things hurtfull to the pretended
end doth things contrary
to his duty and bond. Wherefore
we conclude, that by the
purpoſed end of euery Society,
is drawen and knowen what
actions euery of the aſſociats

are bound to performe, and
from which to abſtaine, adding
thus much for a greater declaration,
of the actions which
may be performed in a ſociety,
ſome are commanded and fall
vnder the bond which in that
fellowſhip bindeth the aſſociats
therof, and theſe are the neceſſary
actions for the obtaining
the deſired end, others are forbidden
and doe diſcredit the
actours thereof, and thoſe are
preiudiciall or contrary to that
end: In both, the bond of
duty hath power, but in thoſe
which are neceſſary it bindeth
to the performance, & in thoſe
which are contrary to the abſtinence.
               Let vs come now to our particular
purpoſe: it hath beene
already ſayd, there is a kinde of
ſocietie betweene the Prince and

the Courtier; the which for the
inequalitie of termes, hath not
altogether the common benefit
for end: yet if not that alone, at
leaſt principally that of the
Maſter, wherefore the Courtier
is bound to doe all that which
doth comprehend the benefit,
profit or ſeruice of his Lord.
And becauſe aboue wee haue
ſufficientlie declared that the
ſeruice which is the end of this
ſociety is reſtrained to the houſhold
or oeconomicall part, in ſort,
that all the houſholde actions
which may redound to the benefit
of the Prince, fall vnder
the bond of the Courtier, that
is, binde him to effect the ſame
for the ſeruice of his Lord: and
on the contrary, all that may
preiudice this oeconomicall ſeruice,
is forbidden the Courtier,
and doing it, doth a thing vnworthie

his name; and by that
reaſon may be called an infamous
ſeruant, ſince that as doing
well, to the deſired end of
the ſocietie, he obteineth honor
thereby: ſo who worketh
to the contrary is defamed; yet
not ſimply or wholly, but anſwerable
to the ſocietie and his
bond of duty. As for example,
hee ſhould be a very infamous
ſouldier, who at the giuing battel
ſhould throw away his armes
and flie, but not wholly diſgraced,
becauſe hee might then
iuſtly be ſo called, as if he had
betrayed his Prince and countrey,
or ſuch like: for the reaſon
which ſhalbe ſhewed elſwhere:
ſo likewiſe he is a diſhonorable
Courtier who acteth any thing
contrary to the oeconomicall ſeruice
of his Prince, but not altogether

a diſgraced man or infamous
citizen.
            
            
               CHAP. VII.
If the Courtier vpon occaſion be
bound to ſpend his life and
goods in the Princes
ſeruice.
               THe Courtier then is bound,
as appeareth by what hath
beene ſayd before, to ſerue his
Prince in all oeconomicall actions,
& not bound but exempt
from all other not conteined
therein, as particularlie hath
beene declared touching the
publike affaires. Not, becauſe
doing any thing therein, he ſhal
not deſerue commendations;
but, becauſe not intermedling
or not willing to deale therein,
he can not iuſtly be cenſured.

The like both may and ought
to be vnderſtood of the particular
offices of the Court, for
that as the Courtier in generall
comprehendeth all the houſehold
ſeruice, and is not otherwiſe
bound to any thing, as not
conteined therein; ſo a particular
officer or miniſter of the
Court is bound onely to thoſe
actions, which particularly belong
to his charge, and for the
which he hath contracted ſeruice
with the Prince: in the other
there is no bond to conſtraine
him. But becauſe it hath
beene ſaid, that generally the
Courtier ought to do all things
belonging vnto oeconomicall ſeruice,
there riſeth a doubt, if
therefore he be bound to neglect
all other reſpects, and not
to care for any loſſe particularly
either of life or goods, fully to

effect the ſame. For ſolution
then of this difficultie, it is neceſſary
againe to ſpeake of ſome
things very important, concerning
ſocietie, but moderatlie,
becauſe in our actuall Philoſophy
wee muſt ſpeake thereof with
greater plainneſſe and more diſtinctly.
Wee ſay then in the
meane time, that particular ſocieties
do aime at ſome particular
good wherewith more eaſily
they obteine that onely happineſſe
whereunto euery humane
deſire and thought is bent, as to
the laſt and moſt noble end,
vnto the which the others doe
ſerue as meanes and helps, with
ſuch order that thoſe neereſt
vnto it are the more noble and
more deſired, ſo that the inferiour
is commanded and ruled
by the ſuperior, or at leaſt without
the hurt or offence of it, nature

not permitting, that a thing
leſſe deſired, ſhould be procured
with the offence or hurt of
an other more deere and noble,
for ſo ſhould the courſe and order
of cauſes be ouerthrowen,
& with that confuſion depriue
the ſecond cauſes of that vertue
and efficacy which they receiue
from the firſt, and by conſequence
make a ſurceaſing of the
motions which ſucceed: the
which is true, not alone in the
cauſes of naturall motion, amongſt
the which the ſuperior
taken away, the inferiour can
worke or moue nothing at all.
As doubtleſſe the elements
ſhould be idle, if the heauen the
ſuperior cauſe were not, neither
would the heauen moue, if the
internall parts aſſiſted not, nor
ſhould that haue force of motion,
if from the ſuperiour, and

finally from the firſt mouer, by
tradition from one vnto the other,
there were not vertue imparted.
But ſo likewiſe it falleth
out in deſignes and purpoſed
Ends; amongſt the which that
is the firſt & chiefeſt, which by
influence (as it were) doth impart
the vertue of mouing the
deſire to all the reſt, and doth
make it happy, as hath beene
ſaid, and by degrees doth much
more qualifie the next adiacent
Ends, in ſuch ſort, that it is
impoſſible for an inferiour to
moue any affection without the
vertue of the ſuperiours purpoſe:
but much more to be able
to mooue the deſire towards
himſelfe, with a preiudice of
that good, which doth exceede
it. By example it will be made
more plain. There is no doubt,
but the ſickeman for his health

ſake longeth for a medicine:
and therefore I ſay, that it is impoſſible
he ſhould wiſh for it,
or in any ſort conſent to the taking
thereof imagining it hurtfull
to his health, and the reaſon
is, becauſe the leſſer or inferiour
purpoſe or end, doth not
moue but by vertue of the greater
and more eminent, and
therefore when no vertue doth
flow from this, that other by no
meanes can be deſired, neither
then doth it impart any vertue
at all, when the inferiour purpoſe
or end doth preiudice or
hurt the ſuperior, as hath beene
ſaid of the potion hurtfull to
the health.
               Now let vs come to our own
caſe, and giue ſolution of the
propounded difficultie, which
moſt eaſily will be done: I ſay
that the Courtier can not deſire

in the ſeruice of his Prince, any
thing that ſhall be hurtfull or
contrarie to his owne profit and
commoditie; the reaſon is, becauſe
he deſireth not the Princes
ſeruice, as thereby mooued
vnto it. But by reaſon of his
owne profit which giuing vertue
and efficacie to that ſeruice,
to mooue the Courtiers deſire
and appetite, doth not ſuffer
for the reaſons before noted,
that he deſire it to his preiudice.
Wherefore all that is contrarie
to the Courtiers profit, meaning
that profit, which (as a Courtier)
is the end hee aimeth at;
hath without queſtion no place
in his deſires, whileſt he deſireth
to ſerue the Prince: all which is
occaſioned by the dependancie
of Ends, amongſt which, his
owne profit is chiefeſt and ſuperior;
the Princes ſeruice, the

leſſer and inferior, whereupon
of neceſſitie that muſt be granted,
becauſe howbeit this Societie
be not fully a ſocietie, for
the diſparity of termes, ſo alſo is
there not aſſigned for the ſcope
thereof a benefit and commoditie
equally common. Yet notwithſtanding
ſince in the contracting
thereof, the election of
the Prince interpoſeth it ſelfe
aſwell as that of the Courtier,
it ſhould in ſome ſort make
common the benefit thereof.
For if you bound it within this
terme, that the ſcope thereof be
the Princes ſeruice, but yet ſo,
as ioined in a ſort to the Courtiers
benefit, becauſe it is abſolutely
impoſſible to worke for
an other, not hauing an intention
for ſome proper benefit.
And this being knowne (as is
ſaid) by the Prince, he contracteth

the ſocietie with a band on
his part alſo, that is, to benefit
the ſeruant (as heereafter ſhall
be declared) and is contented
the Courtier ſerue him, intending
his owne profit: wherefore
the Prince deſiring, that either
without this, or contrary to this
intereſt, the Courtier ſhould
ſerue, requireth a thing contrarie
to all right: neither is the
Courtier in any ſort bound to
ſerue him. And more particularly
to come to the propounded
difficultie, I ſay, that neither
the Prince can looke for it,
nor the Courtier is bound to
ſpend his life for his Lord, the
reaſon why, is, becauſe the
life is farre more deere, then all
that he can either hope for, or
deſire in ſeruice. Whereupon as
he ſhould be held for one vnaduiſed,
who for a leſſer good,

ſhould chuſe the loſſe of a greater
benefit, ſo ſhould that
Courtier haue little diſcretion,
who for the obtaining of the
purpoſe of his ſeruice, which
conſiſteth in profit, dignity and
power, would aduenture the
hazard & loſſe of his life, which
by many degrees is more deere
vnto him, then al theſe benefits;
yea ſuch as without the which
the reſt cannot be obteined: and
if wereſolue thus touching the
life, much more ought we vnderſtand
the ſame in caſe of honor
and reputation, according to
the Ciuill opinion, which is far
more precious then the life in
the higheſt degree. Concerning
Goods, the reſolution is not ſo
eaſie, ſince thoſe who propound
vnto themſelues, the increaſe
or winning of profit, it is neceſſarie
they conſider what they

loſe and what they hope to get,
becauſe it may bee aunſwered
in this ſort: That it is fit to
ſpend leſſe of a mans abilitie in
his Maſters ſeruice, then that
which he is in hope to get by
the ſame: neither is it ment the
Mercenary Courtier is bound to
impoueriſh himſelfe, and ſuffer
detriment in his wealth, fully
and competently to ſerue his
Lord. But who ſo preferreth
dignities, honor and power, reſpects
of much greater eſtimation
then riches, may ſecurely
for the obteining of them
ſpend of his owne, as voluntarily,
not of dutie, if the contract
either expreſly or couertly
binde him not thereunto. The
which point of contracts is very
conſiderable, amongſt the
which are the vſe and cuſtome
of the Courts, the which more

or leſſe tie the Courtiers to like
expences. As if the Prince in any
Court vſe to keepe table for
his ſeruants, the Courtier knowing
the ſame, and bound to ſeruice,
is to ſerue at his owne
charge; which in other Courts
he were not, where the cuſtome
is the Courtiers ſhall be found
their diet. But of like matters,
as things of ſmall note, there
needs no longer diſcourſe.
            
            
               CHAP. VIII.
Of the Princes bond or dutie towards
the Courtier.
               HAuing now reſolued and
made plaine the propoſed
difficulties, it is requiſire before
wee paſſe any farther, to
ſhew, (and indeed the Courtier
may in reaſon deſire to be ſatiſfied)
what the Princes office or

dutie is towards him, hauing
fully ſet downe the Courtiers
dutie vnto the Prince; to the
end he may know what to hope
for by his ſeruice, and how farre
to ſtretch the limits of his pretentions,
becauſe hereof it may
follow, that hee will neither indiſcreetly
make offer of his ſeruice,
not knowing to what end
he ſhal labour, nor happely ſhal
vniuſtly complaine of his Lord,
as nothing liberall or beneficial
towards him: a thing which as
it many times falles out, ſo is it
with all poſſible care to be remooued,
ſince iars and contentions
doe ſtop the paſſage to fauour,
and for the moſt part
breed diſguſts and pikes of ill
ſatisfaction & diffidence both
on the one ſide and on the other.
But becauſe theſe things
ſhall be more largely treated of

elſewhere, we will onely heere
reſtraine our reaſons to breuitie,
and point at that which to
our preſent matter ſeemeth neceſſarie.
Wee ſaie then that
though the ſociety of the Prince
with the Courtier (as before is
noted) be not a perfect ſociety
whereby the end thereof is not
as in others, wholly the common
benefit, there is no doubt
notwithſtanding, but the Prince
hath likewiſe on his part a certaine
bond, by vertue whereof
he is tied not alone to deſire,
but withall to looke out and
performe, ſome thing which
may be beneficiall and commodious
for his ſeruant. And this
is that which at this time wee
purpoſe to manifeſt, that is, vnto
what kinde of benefit, and
vnto what termes he is bound:
becauſe as the Courtier (by what

hath beene ſaid) is not bound to
ſerue him, but in ſome things,
and in thoſe alſo by certaine limits;
it ſeemeth very reaſonable,
that withall, neither the duties
of the Prince ſhould extend
to euery benefit, whereof
the Courtier is capable, but vnto
ſome onely, and in thoſe, vnto
ſome determinate end, ſo that
the one bond may be anſwerable
vnto the other, and that betweene
them, there may be a
due and iuſt proportion, that it
may not ſeeme, this Societie is
raſhly or inconſiderately made.
There is no doubt then, but
moderating this dutie by the
End, ſuch ſhould the action be,
as the firſt purpoſe requireth,
and ſince we haue ſaid the finall
end or ſcope of the Courtier to
be his Proper intereſt, it is moſt
cleere, that as hee is bound to

worke or indeuour to bring to
paſſe that End, which mooued
the Prince to conclude ſocietie
with him, which is his Proper
ſeruice: in like ſort the Prince is
bound to worke for performance
of that end which moued
the Courtier to linke himſelfe in
bonds of ſeruitude with him.
So as wee may ſay, that the
Prince is bound to worke for
the benefit of the Courtier, in
thoſe things that the Courtier
propoundeth to obteine by ſeruice,
and thoſe are Profit and
Honour. But the greateſt difficultie
reſteth, that is, how farre
foorth, or in what meaſure And
truly, if we conſider that in caſes
of Societie, no man performeth
his dutie if hee giue not ſatisfaction
to his companion, which
if he doe, it will be iudged that
hee hath performed the expectatation,

this ſatisfaction then
riſeth from the proportionate
working to that end which his
aſſociate deſireth.
               
                  Endes, as hath beene ſaid before,
are in themſelues infinite,
that is, deſired without meaſure:
ſo as the Courtier deſireth not
an indifferent profit, or a meane
degree or dignitie, but the greateſt
that may be obteined. I
ſpeake not indefinitely, but as
from that Prince, becauſe hee
muſt not in his deſires extend
himſelfe further then the Princes
abilitie doth ſerue, that rule
being well knowne, that no man
is bound to an impoſſibilitie: it
ſhould bee an inſatiable deſire,
which ſhould ſo farre carry any
man to requeſt more of his lord
then hee can doe, or grant or
procure by his authoritie. It
ſeemeth then hitherto, that the

Prince is bound to offer al thoſe
honors and profits vnto his
Courtier, which immediately
or mediately he can grant. Notwithſtanding
we muſt note, that
as the Courtier himſelfe, is not
bound to doe all that he can in
ſeruice of his Prince, when the
performance thereof ſhall bee
preiudiciall to his proper intereſt:
ſo much leſſe is the Prince
bound to benefit the Courtier
in ſuch things as are damageable
or offenſiue to his ſeruice, &
ſo much the more, by any action
preiudiciall to more important
and deſired benefits of his
owne profits: hence may bee
gathered, whether he be bound
to benefit the Courtier in things
which bring diſhonor or ſpecial
detriment to his owne affaires
or fortunes, danger to his life,
diſage to his perſon, or diſpleaſure

to his minde: by theſe
principles alſo may be examined,
if hee bee to benefit that
Courtier, who of neceſſitie is to
abandon his ſeruice, and many
other commendable thinges
woorthie the knowledge of the
curious. But becauſe to proceed
further heerein were to exceed
thoſe termes wherein a methodicall
writer is to conteine this
arte, they are differred and ſhall
be (God willing) fully handled
in that part of actiue Philoſophy,
which treateth of Oeconomicall
prudence.
            
            
               CHAP. IX.
Of two ſorts of ſeruices conſiderable.
               FOraſmuch as I ſuppoſe we
haue ſufficiently diſcourſed
of the purpoſed ſcope or end of

the Courtier, and of his duty in
generall: aſwell the order of the
treaty as their profit to whom
we intend it, requireth, that
we draw vnto the particulars ſo
much as we may, to confirme
and eſtabliſh precepts & rules
for the more prouident proceeding
therein. You ſhall vnderſtand
therefore; that there are
two kind of ſeruice which may
be done vnto the Prince, the
firſt is due and anſwereth to
the particular charge or office
which is held in court, either of
Steward, Treaſurer, Auditor, Secretary,
or ſuch like. The ſecond
is not otherwiſe conteined
in duty, but offereth it ſelfe
of a free-will and election beyond
all duty, and the reaſon
heereof is, that the fauour being
anſwerable to the ſeruice
that is done: who deſireth

greater fauour, then that deſerued
by this particular ſeruice
and proper charge which hee
holdeth in the Court, muſt likewiſe
enlarge himſelfe in ſeruice,
and by that meanes merit a
greater portion of fauour, by
prefiguring vnto himſelfe an
obiect which in the amplitude
thereof may be anſwerable to
the whole cōpaſſe of the ſeruice
hee may doe to the Prince, but
ſo, that the parts reſpectiuely
and in proportion correſpond
vnto the parts of his ſeruice, in
ſuch ſort, that to the office of
Secretary, of Auditor, and the
like, there be allotted ſuch meaſure
of fauor, ſo reſtrained within
his limits, that it partake not
with that of an other office.
Wherefore it is neceſſary for
the Courtier who hath in purpoſe
to be abſolutely poſſeſſed

of al fauor not to content himſelfe
within the termes of his
particular ſeruice, but wiſely to
endeuour the extention of his
confines in a more ample ſort.
Yet with this condition, not
raſhly to diſcouer himſelfe an
vſurper or intruder vpon other
mens offices or charges, bicauſe
this would breede hatred amongſt
the Courtiers, and a
conceipt of preſumption with
the Prince. And therefore muſt
rather chooſe to deale with
thoſe which priuatly belong
not to any one, but are indifferent
to all, and may therefore
be exerciſed by any Courtier
without the preiudice or diſpleaſure
of any one. This kind
in what it conſiſteth ſhall be
declared in his place, in the
meane time we will call it, voluntary

ſeruice, as the firſt ſeruice
of duty.
               
               But there ariſeth heere a
doubt, which is this, if he may
not haue the whole fauour, who
taketh not vpon him the whole
ſeruice, which cannot be done
without the offence of others,
and it may be the little ſatisfaction
of the Prince: it followeth
then that it is impoſſible
euer to be full poſſeſſor of the
entire fauour. Whereunto it is
anſwered, that to intrude into
an other mans charge, not called
& without authority, doth
breed bad effects as hath beene
noted before; but either called
or prouoked thereunto by the
Prince, or put in truſt therewith
through confidence obteined
with him, then he both may
and muſt doe it, where you ſhall

vnderſtand that the order to
obtaine ſuch fauour, is thus: by
ſeruing diligently to the Princes
liking in his ſpeciall or appointed
office, that part of grace or
credit is thereby obteined correſpondent
thereunto, offering
of himſelfe in voluntary ſeruices
that doe encreaſe credit and
fauour, from which encreaſe,
occaſion is offered (as more diſtinctly
ſhall be ſet downe) to
inſinuate himſelfe into the confines
of other mens offices: ſo
that by well ſeruing, fauour is
augmented, & by this increaſe
groweth occaſion to poſſes the
entire ſeruice; whereunto afterward
is anſwerable, the abſolute
embracement of the Princes
loue and fauour; for the winning
wherof the Courtier chiefly
laboreth as the only cauſe of
his felicity.
               
                  
Yet heere riſeth a greater
queſtion, becauſe it is very manifeſt
to be vaine and ſuperfluous
to encreaſe diuers eſſences
& things without ſpeciall neede
or neceſſity: though it be not
without cauſe, the inſtitution
of many officers in a Court,
ſince one alone cannot ſufficiently
ſatisfie the Princes affairs:
and if then it be ſo, he laboreth
in vaine, whoſoeuer hopeth (as
hath beene ſaid) alone to vndertake
the whole ſeruice, and
by conſequence, it ſhall be labour
loſt, to aſpire the winning
of the whole fauour. To this it
is eaſily anſwered, ſhewing firſt
by example, that in the greateſt
adminiſtrations, one alone may
ſuſtaine the charge of all the
ſeruice of a great Prince: as hath
beene done by the antient Pretors
and Proconſuls: who were

ſent into diuers Prouinces: and
by the Viceroies and gouernors
who are at this day deſtinated
to the greateſt charges, and
who doubtleſſe vndertake the
whole ſeruice of the Prince in
thoſe gouernments, for that in
him, that is in his authority, the
whole multitude of inferiour
officers are vnited. Wherefore
I ſay, that one effectually or in
act of execution is not capable
of all the offices in the whole
Court; ſome of them being ſo
nice and troubleſome, that they
require a whole man, free from
all other care: but in effect he
may containe them all, being
able by his authority to inſtitute,
ordaine, diſtribut, moderate
and moue all; ſo that the
whole domeſticall buſineſſe of
the Prince may be perfectly ſatisfied:
for that how be it this

ſeemeth the office of the Maſter
and not of any ſeruant, we
ſee notwithſtanding for the
moſt part, affaires to be ſo little
pleaſing vnto Princes, eſpeciallie
of houſholde matters, that
they had rather leaue the whole
charge, to the wiſedome and
fidelity of ſome one thought
worthy thereof; in which ſort it
is not impoſſible that it ſhould
bee vndertaken by one alone.
Yet it reſteth that we diſcourſe
more particularly of the two
kinds of ſeruices propounded,
and firſt of ſeruice due.
            
            
               CHAP. X.
Of ſeruice by duetie or affectioned.
               IT is neceſſary that firſt we beginne
our deſerts with ſome
particular duetie, a thing which

ordinarily happeneth to all that
will haue footing in Court, becauſe
for the moſt part there is
ſome ſpeciall title of ſeruice aſſigned
them, in the which they
muſt by all the poſſible meanes
they can, giue ſatisfaction to
the Prince. So that, as according
to the old ſentence, ex nihilo
nihil fit, in like ſort, it is impoſſible
for him euer to obtein
any fauour, who hath no portion
or place of ſeruice; but hee
that poſſeſſeth any part, as neceſſarily
euery Courtier doth,
may make himſelfe paſſage to
ſpeciall fauour. And certes hee
deſerueth the name of a wiſe
Courtier, who in the beginning
can giue ſuch force and vigor
to his ſeruice, or any part thereof,
wherein he ſhall be emploied,
that hee grow fruitfull and
fertile in his Princes fauour, euen

to the laſt and higheſt degree:
for thoſe in courſe are moſt
commendable, who by their
dexteritie and Courtly valour
come neereſt to this marke. To
doe the ſame then, it ſeemeth
very requiſit to begin (as it hath
beene ſaid) from the woorthie
and due performance of his
proper charge and place, whereof
we may not heere giue precepts.
Becauſe if the Courtier
be to be Maſter of the horſe, let
him haue recourſe to Cauallerizzi
and ſuch as teach to manage
them; if an Auditour, to
thoſe skilful in accounts, & ſuch
like: the which as euery man
may ſee are not within the terms
of this Arte. But howſoeuer,
let him endeuour to be skilfull
in his owne office, for thereby
he ſhall obteine that fauour and
grace correſpondent thereunto;

it being a thing not queſtionable,
that an excellent Diuine, a
Secretary, or Auditour, manifeſting
themſelues by their works,
ſhould prouoke and allure the
loue and fauour of the Prince,
by ſo much the more, as they
are more rare and excellent.
True it is that here we muſt call
to minde that which before in
another place hath beene ſpoken,
that is, that the fauour of
the Court is not gotten by the
opinion of vertue, but by the
vſe and exerciſe thereof to the
Princes profit. Whereupon none
of them that will deſerue well,
muſt content himſelfe to bee
ſingular and perfect in his profeſſion
alone, but how with
greateſt perfection and rarity in
ſeruice to giue ſatisfaction and
pleaſure to his Prince. This
chiefly conſiſteth in manifeſting

an exact diligence with a deſire
to ſpare no paines fully to giue
him ſatisfaction: for as benefits
ioyned with loue and kinde demonſtrations
infinitly encreaſe
reſpect and duetie, ſo likewiſe
ſeruice done with an earneſt affection
and a kind of partialitie
towards the Prince, worketh
maruellous effects; this being
moſt certeine, that manie petie
ſeruices, and almoſt vnworthie
conſideration, only accompanied
with an affectiue ſhew,
haue beene the beginnings of
ſpeciall rewards and incredible
fauours: and to ſay truth, there
is no ſuch price or meanes to
compaſſe or win loue, as loue it
ſelfe. But heerin we muſt ſtand
well aduiſed to ſhunne a moſt
dangerous rocke, that is, curious
and open affectation, which may
breed an opinion in the Prince

of want of iudgement, in knowing
whats conuenient, or els
that which is more perillous, a
doubt or ſupect of diſſimulation,
and by conſequence an effect
of hatred or ſcorne, not alone
with the Prince, but with
the Courtiers alſo, who take no
pleaſure that any man ſhould
be ouer-diligent, or in apparence
too-too paſſionate in the
Princes ſeruice. Next, not to
giue matter of ieſt by beeing
ſeene beyond all termes of modeſtie
or decorum to become
like an inamoured louer in the
ſeruice of his Lord. This affection
which is an exceſſe, conſiſteth
in nothing elſe than in
making the ſhew before named
with greater ardencie and more
earneſtlie than is fit, either in
the action, which requireth no
ſuch diligent affect, or at leaſt,

not of him that doth it, but of
perſons more inwardlie conioint,
and of the Princes confidents:
or in reſpect of the place
and time, as where the Maſters
eye is preſent, or els ſuch perſons
as neceſſarily or in all likelihood
will giue him notice of
the ſame, it ſhould be coniectured
that therefore he doth exceed
in ſhew thereof, the which
by ſo much the more growes
odious, by how much it is diſcouered
to be done for his own
profit and commodity: and the
more ridiculous, being knowen
the effect of a weak iudgement,
to obſerue decorum in himſelfe,
or in his actions, place or time,
& other circumſtances, al which
proceed from a plebean and a
ſeruile mind. But on the other
ſide, it ſeemeth ſuch demonſtration
and ſhew is done with

reaſon and conueniency, when
in the execution of that which
to our proper charge belongeth,
we do ſo much as is thought
fit and neceſſarie, and beſides
that, perceiuing in the Prince a
deſire that the action be reiterated,
or that a greater diligence
be vſed therein, we endeuour
fully to ſatisfie him, ſhewing to
do the ſame, not only without
any grudge or murmuring, but
with a willingnes and pleaſure,
though it may be inwardly it be
grieuous and diſpleaſing, and
therefore we muſt not attend til
by command the Prince diſcouer
his deſire, but diuing (as it
were) into his minde, make an
incounter with his pleaſure,
preuenting the diſcouery; becauſe
the Prince by nature earneſtlie
deſiring his proper ſeruice,
which conſiſting in the

Courtiers diligence, of neceſſitie
taketh pleaſure to ſee him,
not liberall alone, but prodigall
(if we may ſay ſo) in an earneſt
curioſity and deſire to conſume
himſelfe, for his abſolute
and compleat ſatisfaction. And
in this ſort wee muſt thinke,
the Courtier exactly doth performe
his duty in his particular
charge, from whence there is
hope offered him, when time
ſhall ſerue, to propagate and
enlarge his confines, within the
which his office is reſtrained,
it being verie likelie, that the
Prince being ſatisfied of his abilitie
and readineſſe in his priuat
office, will giue a paſſage and
entrance vnto greater affaires,
which ſhall be the fruit to haue
performed his dutie, as was requiſit,
by reaſon of the place he
beareth in the Court.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XI.
Of voluntary or aſſiſtant ſeruice.
               BVt if notwithſtanding all
this diligent obſeruation of
the things aboue ſaide, the
Prince ſhall affoord vnto the
Courtier no more fauour then
is iuſtly anſwerable to his particular
ſeruice; it is fit hee ſeeke
out other meanes for his promotion,
and to ſay trueth, whoſoeuer▪
will haue, a greater reward
then which of due belongs
vnto him, it ſeemeth very requiſite,
that he doe alſo ſome thing
more, then that which of right
apperteines to him, wherefore
hee muſt not onely endeuour
himſelfe diligently to ſatisfie
his owne charge or place, but
to imploy himſelfe withall in
ſome other things, whereby the
Prince may make coniecture of

the Courtiers loue, and inceſſant
will to doe him ſeruice. Yet
true it is, that heerein wee muſt
be very circumſpect, becauſe to
inſinuate or thruſt himſelfe into
other mens charges without order
from the Prince, ſhould be
a raſhneſſe and preſumption;
wherefore hee ſhall note that
there are certeine endeuors to
this purpoſe very fit, as thoſe
which not onely are not hatefull,
but very acceptable.
               Chiefly this aſſiſtance ſeemeth
to be in places, where the being
is both honorable and commodious
to the Prince, and theſe
are in the forechamber or that
of the Preſence, where manie
ſtrangers meeting, either by occaſion
of buſineſſe, or other
complement, it cannot but be
very gratefull vnto the Prince,
to ſee it well frequented with his

ſeruants, creatures & fauorites,
by whom they are receaued, honored,
enterteined, and in the
end brought before him. In like
ſort when he feedeth, it cannot
but be pleaſing vnto him to bee
incircled with manie attendants;
As alſo in his viſitations,
or if hee chance to goe abroad,
to haue many about him, aſſuredly
will be very acceptable,
aſwell for their readineſſe vpon
any occaſion that may be offred,
as by the honorable reſpect
which he receaueth, not
ſo much by the multitude,
which is a ſign of magnificence,
as by their diligent ſeruice,
which argueth a liberal and beneficiall
minde in him; wherefore
the Courtier muſt not
thinke it tedious or time loſt to
be preſent vpon ſuch occaſions,
the which thing will make ſo

much the greater impreſſion, if
ſuch be his office, as by vertue
thereof he may well be excuſed,
becauſe by how much leſſe hee
is bound thereunto, the greater
note is taken of his affection.
This then is the benefit which
is gotten by this attendance or
aſſiſtance, which in ſumme, is
the Princes ſatisfaction, but the
fruit which it bringeth with it,
is of much more importance by
the occaſions which are offered
of infinite conſequence in this
arte: for that by this attendance,
in place where he is often ſubiect
to the eie of the Prince, he
winneth euery day a greater familiaritie,
and accuſtoming his
ſight to the obiect of his perſon,
the Courtier doth ſtil keepe
himſelf in a freſh remembrance:
beſides all this, manie times
there falleth out occaſion of

buſineſſe in ſome matters, the
execution wherof either in their
own nature, or for want of time
or other cauſe, is not committed
to thoſe to whom in Court
it doth properly belong; but to
ſuch whom chance or choice
made preſent; and although
this belong not to their office,
as hath beene ſaid, yet yeelding
ſatisfaction, by the dexterous
performance thereof, it mooueeth
in the Prince a thought and
will, choicely or by name to
command him at an other time,
and in the end to poſſeſſe him
wholy with that charge. I leaue
to ſpeak of the accidents which
may fall out, by one whereof, or
very few of them, the entire fauour
may bee obteined. It is
moſt cleere, that Seianus by many
ſleights made conqueſt of
Tiberius loue: yet that accident

of falling of the grott or caue,
whoſe ruins he held vp, defending
the life of his Prince, with
perill of his owne, did ſo farre
aduance his fauour, that afterwards
euen at his pleaſure they
might diſpoſe of him. But amongſt
the reſt of al theſe, there
are two moſt important benefits,
by this diligent aſſiſtance
or preſence, the one is the
knowledge of the nature & humour
of the Prince: the other is
occaſions, which often fall out,
to haue diſcourſe or talke with
him. The knowledge of the
nature, cuſtomes, affections &
humour of the Prince, is moſt
neceſſary, for imitation and accommodating
your ſelfe vnto
him. The occaſion of diſcourſe
or talke with him, is of no leſſe
infinite conſideration and profit;
whereof it being ſo, that we

ſhall ſpeake heereafter; we will
in the meane time ſaie ſomething
of the meanes how to
know the humor of the Prince,
and of fitting your ſelfe thereunto;
and after we will treat of
reaſoning and diſcourſe with
him.
            
            
               CHAP. XII.
Meanes how to know the nature
and affection of
the Prince.
               IF it be neceſſarie euerie artizan
haue knowledge of the
matter wherein he is to ſhew the
eſſence and forme of his arte
and occupation; as the Tailor
of cloth; of iron the Smith; and
the Maſon of marble: If the
Phyſitian can not put in practiſe
his facultie, without a precedent
knowledge of the body,

curable, and to be ſhort, of euerie
agent, preſuppoſe the knowledge
of the ſubiect wherein
they are to worke: we may alſo
ſay it is great reaſon, that the
Courtier being by his labour
and induſtrie to induce and
gently wreſt into the Princes
minde a loue and liking of him,
ſhould by ſo much as is poſſible
haue a full and perfect knowledge
of him, to the end that
by this foreknowledge, he may
order, rule, and moderate al his
actions: ſince it is out of queſtion,
that there is not one maner
of proceeding with all men: for
we may by ſome way obteine
the fauour of one, which would
procure the hatred of another:
wherefore if the nature of euery
one lay open and were manifeſt,
ſo that eaſily it might bee
learned and perceiued, it were

an idle thing to giue precepts
to obſerue it, or to obteine the
knowledge therof. But becauſe,
than it, there is nothing more
cloſe or ſecret to him that hath
not prying eies alwaies open aſwell
of body as minde, it ſhall
not bee ſuperfluous briefly to
diſcourſe of this matter.
               We ſay then that diuers are
the meanes wherby the natures
of men are knowen, amongſt
the which the art of Phyſiognomy
doth helpe very much, by
meanes wherof ſome haue been
able to penetrate and ſearch into
the inmoſt and moſt concealed
affects of the minde of other
men: And howbeit the arte
ſeeme full of fallacies, yet when
many ſignes concurre together
ſignifying one and the ſame affect,
then wiſemen will not that
it bee vaine to giue credit, as

ſetled vpon naturall grounds.
Galen on their ſide is of opinion,
and hath largely diſcourſed
thereupon, that Animi mores
ſequantur temperaturam corporis.
And vnto him the whole Colledge
of the beſt Phyſitions do
conſent, that the temperature
and compoſition of the body
being knowen, it is moſt eaſie
to geſſe what are the affects,
manners and naturall inclinations
of the minde. The Rhetoritians,
amongſt whom Ariſtotle,
as chief & Prince, teach this excellent
rule, to conſider the age
and condition; as whether old
or yong, or of a middle time,
whether noble or ignoble, rich
or poore, whether potent or of
meane fortune, and ſuch like,
vnto which conditions he doth
attribute their particular affects
and manners, ſo that knowing

in which of them any man is
found, preſently are his affections
knowen: we may beſides
ioine vnto theſe the education
and profeſſion, apt alſo to qualifie
and giue a habit to their
ſubiects. Likewiſe in the books
by me ſet foorth of Eloquence
it is declared, that from the
phraſe of ſpeech and metaphors
that are vſed, the nature
of him that formeth them may
be perceiued, and this alſo to
haue beene the opinion of antient
ſages, whereof as I ſuppoſe
in that worke I haue giuen ſufficient
reaſon.
               But becauſe theſe & ſuch like
waies are too much grounded
vpon Generals, & to the Courtier
by reaſon of the place he
holdeth, there is a more ſecure
paſſage offered, we ſay that the
true meanes to attaine to the

knowledge of the Princes nature
and cuſtome is by his actions:
and yet not all, but thoſe
of choice, becauſe theſe diſcouer
the inclination, as by the effect
the cauſe is knowen; and
although diſſimulation, at firſt
ſight putting on a colourable
habit, and occaſion of the action,
either different or contrary
to the naturall propenſion and
inclinement, it is yet notwithſtanding
impoſſible to conceale
or hide the ſame, from a
circumſpect and wiſe Courtier,
for that if watchfully he ſhall
obſerue actions, it will eaſily
appeare whether he worke naturally
and by a contracted habit,
or elſe diſſemblingly; becauſe
nature being euer the
ſame, and habits being gotten
by cuſtome, the actions muſt
needes be vniforme and alike

within themſelues. But diſſimulation
wherewith nature is
not inueſted, but ouer-ſhadowed
cannot be of that force, but
that ſome beame or raie of the
true and naturall inclination at
one time or other will pierce
and paſſe the ſame, and this is
ſo true, that as yet there hath
neuer beene ſeene, nor is it poſſible,
euer to ſee ſo excellent a
diſſembler, who hath not beene
diſcouered and vnmasked by
him who familiarly ſhall deale
with him and carefully conſider
his actions by due comparing
them together. Becauſe the
arte of diſſembling groweth of
a forced and contrary habit vnto
nature, it cannot be, but many
times of his proper force
withdrawing it ſelf from vnder
ſo heauy a yoake it will worke
actions quite contrary to thoſe

of diſſimulation. True it is that
the cunning diſſembler is cautelous
and wary, and therefore
doth not diſrobe himſelfe of
his habit, but either by violence
or confidence: by Violence, I
meane forced by ſome mighty
hand to ſay or worke the truth,
a thing which cannot fall out
betweene the Prince and the
Courtier. But there is an other
kinde of violence, very profitable,
and to be conſidered, that
is, an exceſſe of the affections
ſtirred vp or moued: the cauſe
is, reaſon being ſometimes troubled
induceth forgetfulneſſe of
that caution, openeth the ſecrets
of the heart, and diſcouereth
that, which diſſimulation
kept moſt ſecret, beſides the
promptnes or difficulty it ſelfe
of falling into theſe exceſſes laieth
open what is the true naturall

habit, becauſe from hence it
groweth that he is more or leſſe
prone or apt to perturbations
vpon ſuch like motions. But
the conſideration of Confidence
is of moſt ſpeciall importance,
the which particularly conſiſteth
in places and perſons, and
in the perſons is conſidered the
beneuolence wherewith they
are made firme, or the opinion
of their incapacity to vnderſtand
and penetrate, as alſo to
make manifeſt that which they
know in the places, for that the
chiefeſt end of diſſimulation
being to maske or ſhadow naturall
inſtinct, when the places
giue aſſurance, promiſing ſecrecie
by their remoteneſſe from
the knowledge of men they do
eaſily entice the diſſembler to
giue the raines & liberty to the
force of nature; and by the ſame

reaſon, to diſcouer himſelfe to
muddy perſons of little vnderſtanding,
and leſſe accuſtomed
to their caution: or rather becauſe
naturall actions, are done
with more eaſe & pleaſure, they
put off, or at leaſt eaſe themſelues
of that habit of diſſimulation:
they doe this and much
more with perſons of whoſe
loue they are very confident,
and therfore it is reported that
Seianus varijs artibus Tiberium
deuinxit adeo, vt obſeurum aduerſum
alios, ſibi vni incautum intectúmque
efficeret: By ſundry
ſleights had ſo bewitched Tiberius,
that being ſecret to all others,
to him alone he lay open
and vncircumſpect.
               The Courtier then who earneſtly
deſireth to ſound his
Princes minde muſt, mal-gree
diſſimulation, haue notice of

his actions in his moſt retired
places, know what talke he hath
with common perſons, particular
confidents, and with thoſe
that either by age or want of
wit may make him more ſecured,
becauſe by the collection
of the actions and talke obſerued
and compared together,
and the conformity or diſagreement
betweene them well conſidered,
the way will be very
plaine to know him aſwel within
as without. Taking care notwithſtanding
to doe this in ſuch
ſort, that for a Courtier you be
not taken as a ſpie, and withall
remember, that tamneſcire quaedam,
quam ſcire oportet: It is as
fit not to know ſome things as
to know them: To conclude,
all theſe actions muſt be tempered
and accompanied with
dexterity, the which cannot be

taught, but muſt be naturall,
though by experience in many
things, it be much refined.
            
            
               CHAP. XIII.
The manner how to accommodate
himſelfe to the Princes
humor.
               NOw that the Courtier ſhall
haue perfect knowledge
what is the humor and inclination
of his Prince, it reſteth to
conſider in what ſort hee is to
conforme himſelfe thereunto
in his ſeruice; wherefore we ſay,
that the nature of the Prince, either
is plaine and open, and as
they ſay, abſque fuco, & fallacia,
or it is encombred and ſhadowed
with a skreene of diſſimulation.
If it be open, the rule is
eaſie therein to be obſerued, becauſe
to what he is ſeene to incline,

to the ſame without all
queſtion is the Courtier to enable
and conforme himſelfe,
profeſſing armes if the Prince
be of nature martiall; learning
& letters, if he delight in knowledge;
in holineſſe and religion,
if he be deuout; neat and delicate
in apparell, entertainments
and all other things, if he vrge
this; diligent and quicke in execution,
if he in his actions be
exquiſite and by nature ſpeedy.
To conclude, he is to adapt and
fit himſelfe by all the meanes
he may vnto his will, and make
himſelfe, if it bee poſſible, the
very portract of his properties
and faſhions. Becauſe ſelfe loue
which is the roote of all other
loues, chiefly extends it ſelfe
vnto his like, and more towards
thoſe who conforme themſelues
in maners and naturall

inclination thereunto. Beſides,
if he make ſhew of imitation not
by proneneſſe of nature, but by
wil & of choice purpoſe, this alſo
is very pleaſing, & is as an approbation
of his actions, manners,
and choice; a thing of all
men deſired: or at leaſt as in
tearmes of obedience and conſent.
               It is by oddes a thing more
difficult to fit himſelfe to diſſembled
humors: becauſe framing
himſelfe to that which
fainedly the Prince profeſſeth,
it is moſt cleare that ſuch conformity
doth not light vpon his
naturall inclination, and therefore
doth not ſearch vnto the
quicke, but reſteth vpon a ſuperficiall
affectation: On the
other ſide, if he will make profeſſion
of the Princes faſhions
with a cloſe diſſimulation, it

cannot bee pleaſing vnto himſelfe
without his own preiudice,
knowing that no man praiſeth
or commendeth that in another,
which he doth truly hate
in himſelfe (I ſpeake in matter
of cariage or behauiour) and
ſurely hee ſhould feed himſelfe
with a vaine hope, that ſhould
thinke to be pleaſing by intemperance,
to him that maketh
ſhew to be deuoted vnto continency:
or by a deſire of reuenge
to him, who either openly or
couertly declares himſelfe eaſie
to forget all iniuries. To conclude,
the Prince diſſembling,
cannot openly bee delighted
with any one, that ſhall make
ſhew to haue a habit in that,
which colourably he is faine to
couer, without manifeſting the
truth of his inward meaning,
and making the falſe appearance

to be knowne. But on the
contrary, he doth not truly conforme
himſelfe vnto the Prince
who doth not wholly fit himſelf
to his true and naturall inclination.
Wherefore in theſe difficulties,
it ſeemes the indifferent
way is not to diſcouer himſelfe
openly or by a profeſſed habit
to be contrary to the diſſimulation
of the Prince; (for example)
ſhewing himſelfe incontinent,
with one that profeſſeth
temperance. For that this might
in reaſon ſeeme a deſpiſing of
him, and to haue in ſlight eſteeme
the diſguſt or diſpleaſure
which he by theſe actions and
contrary courſes might giue to
the Princes open and apparent
diſpoſition: or elſe might breed
ſuſpect of his knowledge of the
diſguiſe or counterfeiting; a
thing, which queſtionles might

win him hatred. But the Courtier
muſt ſhew himſelfe to bee
naturally inclined thereunto, although
in reaſon hee repugne
the ſame, and be ſame to force
himſelfe thereunto: becauſe
that which is truly naturall vnto
the Prince, ſhall ſo much the
more be iudged a naturall inclination
in him, though masked
with a vaile o
                     •
                   di
                     •••
                  mulation.
Hence it is very likely would
grow great good liking in the
Prince, and the high way vnto
confidence would be made eaſie:
beſides, ſince needs be muſt
lie open vnto ſome, it is cleere,
he will ſooner diſcouer himſelfe
vnto one, to bee of like affect,
and much more if happily the
Courtier be able to ſerue him in
that inclination; wherefore we
ſay it is neceſſary in termes of obedience
and of dutifull regard

towards the Prince diſſembling,
to conforme himſelfe in ſome
part to the coloured affect and
faſhion. But to make paſſage
vnto confidence, it is more profitable
to giue apparent ſignes
of a true, or a truly diſſembled
inclining in himſelfe, the which
inclining muſt bee like to that
which he knowes truly to be naturall
in the Prince, vnto whoſe
humour in my opinion this is
the next way to bee conformable.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII.
Whether it be fit to haue often
ſpeech or conference with
the Prince.
               WE come now to ſpeake
of the conferences with
the Prince, and firſt of all let
vs conſider, if it be profitable

to the Courtier to haue eaſie acceſſe
vnto the Princes eares, becauſe
on the negatiue part, it
ſeemeth there are theſe reaſons,
as doubtleſſe that this manifeſt
fauour breedeth him great enuie
with the other Courtiers,
and how pernitious a thing that
is, is very plaine, whereof wee
mind to ſpeake at large in due
place: beſides many informations
are made vnto the Prince,
whoſe author not being known,
it is attributed vnto thoſe, who
often haue conference with
him, whereupon followeth the
hatred, not alone of thoſe offended
but of others who haue reaſon
to feare the like, beſide the
note of a malignant detractor.
Heereunto is added a waightie
conſideration, that in reaſoning
the Courtier vſeth many or few
words: if few, he doth not fit his

Lords intention, who many
times giues him this acceſſe,
for entertainment of the time
which he deſireth. In this caſe to
walke too warily, beſides that it
makes a ſhew either of a ſeuere
or a diſſembled nature, it giues
no pleaſing guſt, but breeds a
diffidence: if many wordes, a
prouident and wittie Prince,
(ſuch as we ſuppoſe the Prince
worthie to bee ſerued by our
Courtier inſtructed in this art)
will eaſily ſee into his manners
and affections, which happily
with more profit might haue
been concealed, nor can this be
but very hardly holpen, becauſe
the Courtier being to make anſwer
to demands, and to perſiſt
in his diſcourſe, ſo long as it ſhall
pleaſe the Prince, it is almoſt
impoſſible to go ſo couertly to
worke, that truth it ſelfe glides

not, or glanceth out ſometime.
And ſurely as loue is a moſt
ſweet torture, which oftentimes
vnlockes the cabinet of cloſeth
ſecrets, wherupon they are wont
to ſay that, il caldo del letto, dilegua
ſouuente il ghiaccio della taciturnita:
The heat of the bed ofttimes
doth thaw the Iſe of ſecrecie,
which husbands ſhould
in many things conceale: So
from a minde not well eſtabliſhed
and made immoueable againſt
the windes of Courtly
ambition, the pleaſure of the
maſters conference ſteales many
things from the ſeruant,
which to their greater profit
ſhould haue beene better kept.
               But for all this there are on
the part affirmatiue, more liuely
reaſons and of greater force,
becauſe for certainty amongſt
all the paſſages offered to the

Princes fauour, there is not one
of them, that by a more plaine
and eaſie way doth lead to our
deſired end than this, becauſe it
doth intrinſecate and make familiar,
yet ſo far foorth as a modeſt
ſeruant may bee with a reuerenced
maſter: It giues fit occaſion
& opportunity to beare
his humors and affections, and
to giue an earneſt & taſte of our
owne proper vertue and valor:
a thing not of ſmall regard with
thoſe who conſider how many
are in Court who through want
of that commoditie to make
their talent known vnto their
Prince, keepe the ſame buried
in ſterilitie. Beſides the reputation
which it brings is held ineſtimable,
not alone, becauſe
making profit of the Princes
iudgement, hee cannot but
bee commended alſo, who is

thought worthy his domeſticke
and familiar ſpeech. But yet
much more in this, that becauſe
the Courtiers reputation conſiſting
in the fauor of the Prince,
which in reſpect of other fauors
we may terme abilitie and power
to pleaſure others; it is moſt
cleere that this is chiefly expected
from thoſe who haue libertie
of often conference, and
by conſequence fit times to preſent
the petitions and requeſts
of other men.
               But aboue all the reſt, more
eſtimable, is the facilitie which
groweth thereby, to diue and
ſound into the deepeſt thoghts
& affections of his Lord, and to
ſhew in himſelfe a diſpoſition
and nature pliable and conformable
thereunto. To this purpoſe
I muſt not leaue to note;
that for oftentimes in reaſoning

and like conference, the quicke
and liuely ſharpneſſe of the wit,
or elſe the dulneſſe and pouerty
of ſpirit is diſcouered, it is a
moſt neceſſarie obſeruance, to
marke and ſearch of what kinde
that of the Princes is heerein,
becauſe though it ſeeme verie
reaſonable, that by how much
the more the officers are of ſpirit,
life and capable of euerie
command, by ſo much they
ſhould bee more reſpected and
held more deare: yet ſhall you
finde ſome kind of Princes, that
as they will flie the extremity of
folly in followers, ſo are they
better pleaſed with a mediocrity
& indifferency, then with this
ſingularitie and ſuperexcellency.
Mark what Cornelius Tacitus
ſpeaketh of Poppaeus Sabinus: Is
modicus originis prencipum amicitia
conſulatum ac triumphale decus

adeptus, maximiſque prouincijs
per quatuor & viginti annos
impoſitus, nullam, ob eximiam artem,
ſed quod par negotijs, ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ſupra
erat. He was but of meane
parentage, yet through the fauour
of Princes, that is of Auguſtus
and Tiberius, he obtained
the honour of Conſulſhip, and
triumphed, being gouernour of
many great prouinces for foure
and twentie yeares, not for any
great skill that abounded in
him, hauing ſo much as was only
equall to his imploiments,
and no more. And this groweth
either of feare, leſt from
theſe excellent wits ſome thing
might be plotted againſt their
gouernment, or of ſhame to be
vnder them in vertue, ouer
whom they are in fortune, or
leſt their actions ſhould bee
cenſured and their affections

knowen, though arteficially
ſhadowed: Or ſuſpecting to
want rewards anſwerable to
their deſerts and which might
ſatisfy their expectation, knowing
that high ſpirits, aime not
at baſe and vulgar marks; Or
(in fine) for ſome other hard
and impenetrable cauſe. It is
therefore manifeſt, that it behoueth
the Courtier to be well
aduiſed, and with circumſpection
to proceed and preſent himſelfe
with ſuch maner of ſpeech
vnto the Prince, as he perceiueth
may pleaſe his humour;
whereupon, confidence will
eaſily ſucceed, by vertue and
meanes whereof many imploiments
not belonging to his
charge ſhall be conferred vpon
him, and next by conſequence,
the chiefeſt ſecrets, according to
the qualities which by little and

little the Prince ſhall diſcouer
in him, and this is the way and
meanes to enlarge the confines
of his particular ſeruice in the
Court: next vnto the which
followeth in proportionable
courſe the poſſeſſion of that fauour,
which with ſo great labour
is procured.
               Therefore as this occaſion is
greatly to be deſired, ſo is it neceſſary
to teach the meanes to
make vſe therof, which we will
diligently doe, when we ſhall
by anſwer haue cleered the difficulties
on the contrary part ſet
downe in the beginning. To
the firſt therfore we ſay, that of
two euils it is good to auoide
the worſt; wherefore the apparent
fauour of a Princes conference
may breed enuy, yet is
this much better, then by ſuch
ſcruple or feare to loſe the occaſion

of greateſt efficacy (that
is, to inſinuate himſelfe into the
fauour of his lord) which a long
and tedious courſe of ſeruitude
can afford; beſides that multa
experiendo fiunt,
                  Ann. 15. 
                  quae ſegnibus ardua
videantur: Many things by
aduenture are brought to paſſe,
which vnto the ſlothfull cowards
doe ſeeme hard. And who
well obſerueth the courſes of
principalities and courts ſhall
finde that true which Tacitus
ſaith;Ann. 4. 
                  Dommandi ſpes in arduo,
vbi ſiſ ingreſſus adeſſe ſtudia &
miniſtros, ſteps to ſoueraignety
are hard, but once entred vpon,
both fauourers, furtherers and
followers are preſent, but eſpecially
& particularly vnto thoſe
who are not ſorted onely with
fortune and audacity, but guided
& accompanied with iudgment
and wiſedome. Thus

much we ſay when enuy cannot
be conquered, vnto which purpoſe
wee will heereafter giue
more neceſſary aduertizements.
To that difficulty of hatred (of
eaſie growth by the opinion of
reports and bad offices) we ſay,
that who will be friend to all,
pleaſing, and at leaſt no apparent
pretendor, gentle and officious,
ſhall eaſily finde remedy
againſt this conceit; & particularly
if he ſhall in effect abſtaine
from ſo hatefull an action,
whereof in his due place we will
abundantly ſpeake. Next followeth
the danger he may incur
with the Prince in caſe of being
too brief or too large in ſpeech,
wherein he muſt take counſell
of nature, who is ſcarce and
ſparing of words vnto ſome, &
vnto others too abundant and
plentifull, aduiſing to correct

natures defect by the helpe of
art, giuing ſuppliment to want,
& abatement to abundance, by
a iudicious preſcription, which
in ſuch like caſes muſt bee the
trueſt leuell, and wherewith he
muſt be fully fraught, who pretends
to port himſelfe in the
chiefeſt harbour of his Princes
fauour. But as touching the vnaduiſed
manifeſting his defects
or diſcouering ſome thing elſe
that might be dangerous, we anſwer:
this art is not ſet down to
men of ſo ſlight a ſtuffe, that are
not maſters of their owne conceipts,
and who cannot ſhelter
or defend themſelues (if at leaſt
they cannot auoid and hide the
ſame) in ſuch ſort, as with ſilence
to ouerpaſſe that which for
their profit muſt bee kept in ſecrecie.
But vnto ſuch as muſt be
apt to ſincke into the inmoſt

parts of his Prince, by meanes
of things connext in one, or
many ſpeeches: forming vnto
himſelfe by vertue of them, certaine
concluſions, the which if
not demonſtratiuely and by neceſſitie,
yet at leaſt by coniecture,
and other obſeruations
taught before, may giue notice,
what are his inclinements, pleaſures,
and cogitations; ſo that he
may as well wiſely detect his
cloſeſt deſignes, as ſhunne the
danger to bee detected by the
Prince, although it cannot bee
denied, the Commander to
haue the aduantage in this eſpial
and diſcouery, as he to whom
it doth belong to interrogate,
continue or to change diſcourſe
at pleaſure: yet theſe things do
not conclude, that to haue often
acceſſe to ſpeake with the
Prince is not very profitable

and to bee deſired by the Courtier.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XV.
How many and what be the kinds
of ſpeeches or diſcourſes the
Courtier is to haue
with his Prince.
               SInce to ſpeake generally in
matters of action is not ſo
profitable, as by ſo much as we
may to come vnto particulars;
it is neceſſarie that we treat in
ſpeciall of the kinds of ſpeeches
which the Courtier may haue
with his Prince, and in euery of
them giue thoſe aduertiſements
which are fit profitably to paſſe
them. But to do this, we muſt
firſt ſee how many & what theſe
kindes be, wherein not proceeding
in a ſtrict and philoſophicall
maner, but rather conformable

to common capacity, the
thing in my opinion will not be
very hard. Wherefore without
keeping ſo preciſely the precepts
of diuiſion (one of the hardeſt
things in humane vnderſtanding)
wee will ſay, that wee
talke or reaſon with the Prince,
either for his pleaſure and delight,
to ouerpaſſe that time of
leaſure for recreation from the
toils of ordinary affaires belonging
to his ſtate and calling, &
theſe we call ſpeeches of entertainment;
or elſe our talke with
him is limited to ſome end either
of a thing done, or to bee
done, and which belongeth to
his honour, intereſt or ſtate, and
theſe we call conference of ſtate:
All others, if any ſuch there be,
are reduced vnder theſe two.
Of the which, becauſe thoſe of
State are moſt important, wee

will handle them in the firſt
place, and thoſe of Entertainment
afterwardes.
            
            
               CHAP. XVI.
How to take opportunitie to induce
a conference of ſtate.
               THe firſt conſideration is
concerning the maner how
to induce or begin theſe conferences,
the which are either
touching the Princes intereſt, or
things which in ſome ſort belong
vnto the Courtiers charge,
and will eaſily giue an entrance
to inſinuation. But becauſe euery
Prince, who for the variable
multitude of his actions (wil
haue as reaſon requireth, ſome
order) is vſed to diuide his time,
appointing to certaine houres
ſetled imploiments, this thing
muſt bee moſt diligently obſerued,

for that doing otherwiſe,
beſides the moleſtation hee
ſhould giue the Prince in diſordering
of his courſe he ſhall receiue
many times but little ſatisfaction,
and get the name of
Buſie-bodie. And if the buſineſſe
haue no determinate and ſet
houre, it ſhall be good counſell
to reſerue it vnto ſome of thoſe
appointed for affaires, keeping
entire, ſo much as is poſſible, the
time of recreation, not onely
deare to euerie man by nature,
but ſpecially neceſſarie vnto
thoſe that with many toiles are
ouer-wearied. But if the affaire
bee extraordinarie and of import,
hee may ſecurely change
the courſe, and alter the appointed
houres, withall (ſo the
matter bee not of ſuch waight,
that it is needfull of the Princes
inſtant knowledge) wee muſt

giue due ſpace to thoſe occaſions,
which either for healths
ſake; or ſafety of the life are fit
to bee done, as times of diet,
ſleep or phyſicke, to auoid infirmities
as well of body as mind,
wherein to negotiate is forbidden.
            
            
               CHAP. XVII.
What is to bee obſerued in the
paſſing of this conference
of ſtate.
               THe conuenient and fit time
with ſpeciall conſideration
being taken, and the houre of
negotiating being come, the
circumſpect ſeruant, muſt either
firſt, or in the very inſtant,
or ſo ſoone as may be, by himſelfe
or by ſome other meanes
diſcouer the moode & humor,
that the Prince is in, for all are

not of Tiberius mind, of whom
Tacitus ſaith,Ann. 4. 
                  Negotia pro ſolatijs
accipiebat, that tooke diſpatches
for diſports: and much leſſe it
may bee to finde him ſtill in one
minde, nor to haue the ſame
motion to the ſame things.
Wherefore diſcouering an indiſpoſition
to the buſineſſe, either
by ſome affect of his minde
or body, it is expedient to reſtraine
the conference into as
few termes as may bee, and to abridge
the time, from being
troubleſome; for the ill diſpoſition
of the ſubiect with whom
wee are to treat, is no leſſe contrary
to the happie ſucceſſe
of the buſineſſe, then is an vntimely
houre. I vnderſtand
this of affaires which neceſſarily
muſt paſſe, and needs
bee heard, becauſe in others,
whoſe ſcope and end are the benefit

or profit of our friends, or
elſe containe ſome deſired fauour,
wee muſt of neceſſity awaight
fandi molles aditus, eaſie
entrances of ſpeech, and therefore
reſerue them till there be a
compoſed, quiet & ſetled mind
willingly diſpoſed to giue audience,
a thing which very ſeldom
falleth out with ſome, who are
ſo auſtere and ſterne, that it is almoſt
impoſſible euer to find either
fit houre or humor to conferre
with them. Such are men
giuen to their pleaſures & paſſetimes,
beſides the which they
thinke on nothing elſe: and ſuch
are men cholerick by cuſtom or
by nature, in whom either age or
practiſe in managing affaires
hath not bred a gentler temper.
But if the Prince bee well diſpoſed,
then muſt the Courtier endeuour
himſelfe that the buſineſſe

whereof hee is to ſpeake
(for ſomuch as belongeth vnto
him) bee aptly and commendably
ſet downe and handled. For
the knowledge whereof he ſhall
vnderſtand, that to negotiate
with a Prince, may conſiſt either
in laying open or declaring
ſome fact or ſeruice done, to the
end he conſider thereof as hee
thinkes good; or manifeſting
ſome buſineſſe, to the end to
receiue order for the execution
and performance. And heerein
alſo is contained the fauours or
recompences which either for
himſelfe or others are demanded,
and in the one or the other
the opening or concealing his
opinion; or finally in declaring
the maner of execution and
performance of ſome action,
which is commonly called a
Relation. Wherefore in the relating

any thing whatſoeuer we
muſt firſt and chiefly haue regard
to truth, aſwell for the integrity,
duty and faith due by
euery honourable Courtier vnto
his Prince, as becauſe hee
may make a more commendable
reſolution, knowing that
from falſe principles in good
conſequence a true concluſion
is neuer gathered: next there is
requiſite apparancy, to eaſe the
vnderſtanding of the Prince,
and lighten the burthen of the
buſineſſe and breuity: Not to
keepe him troubled ouerlong
hauing otherwiſe many diuertions
of importance. Next in receiuing
directions for the executing
of any thing, either by
himſelfe or others, there is required
not onely a diligent attention
of the mind, rightly and
preſently to take the ſame, without

neceſſity of repetition, becauſe
this, beſides the trouble,
would breed an opinion in the
Prince, of incapacity, and withall
a want of memory and retention,
to performe the ſame anſwerable
to the intent of the
commandement.
               But of all the reſt, there is
none of more import, than the
charge to giue aduice and ſhew
his opinion vpon any thing:Lib. 1. hiſt.
                  Nam ſuadere principi quod oporteat,
multi laboris, ſaith Tacitus,
it is a hard taske to perſwade a
Prince to doe that hee ought.
Whereupon it is neceſſarie to
note not to deale therein but by
command, when the bond of
your office doth not require it,
and howſoeuer it is fit to vſe
modeſty, not to ſeeme too wiſe,
and by all meanes poſſible to
auoid obſtinacy in your owne

conceipts, eſpecially againſt the
opinion and iudgement of the
Prince. There is heerein required
wiſdome as the mother of
all good counſel, and a demonſtratiue
inclination of loue towards
him, to the end that with
the more facility, he may receiue
that which is propounded
for your profit.
               Laſtly, in declaring things already
executed you muſt vſe
truth, plaineneſſe, & al that good
Rhetoritians ſet downe to make
a worthy 
                     •••
                  ation. But to all
theſe things there are two moſt
important aduertizements yet
to be added; the firſt is Secrecie,
becauſe without that, in vaine
is the Princes confidence procured,
whoſe thoughts and intentions,
by ſo much as is poſſible,
muſt be kept concealed, aſwell
for the inconueniences

which may grow thereby, as
for your own reputation, which
will be ſo much the greater, as
theſe ſhall bee the more occult
and ſecret. The other is, not to
vſe too great curioſity, in diuing
deeper into the Princes
thoughts, then is conuenient,
or hee thinks fit to reueale, remembring
that, abditos principis
ſenſus, & ſi quid occultius parat,
exquirere, illicitum anceps: To be
buſie in queſt of Princes ſecret
thoghts, or what vnlawful drifts
they haue in hand, is both dangerous
and doubtfull. And for
certaine many haue erred heerin,
whereof haue followed contrary
effects to their deſires,
becauſe ſeeking by this meanes
to lincke and inward themſelues
more ſtrictly, they haue
oftentimes as too nice and curious
been excluded all waighty

affaires. And this is as much
as I thinke fit to ſpeake concerning
Conference of State; now
followeth that of Entertainement.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVIII.
How to induce conference of
Entertainement.
               BY how much theſe conferences
ſeem leaſt neceſſary,
by ſo much the skill and art to
profit by them is the more laborious,
the which notwithſtanding
muſt bee exactly kept and
put in practiſe for the benefit
which followeth therof, becauſe
happily theſe open more the
way to Confidence, than thoſe
of State. The reaſon is, becauſe
theſe being induced & brought
in by choice and for pleaſure,
bring foorth many times by

their continuance, ſuch delight
and ſweetneſſe to the Prince,
that willingly hee riterates the
ſame, and by little and little, laiing
aſide Princely ſeuerity, begins
by this familiarity to proportionate
the Courtiers condition
neerer to that of his ſtate,
and in time breeds a diſpoſition
to participate and impart vnto
him many things, and ſo ſucceſſiuely
doth enable him to take
knowledge of his moſt ſecret
thoughts; either hid from others,
or onely knowne by reaſon
of their offices, not by free
election of good liking, and
therefore it may be not ſo fully
imparted.
               Wherefore occaſion of ſuch
conference with the Prince may
riſe, either of his owne nature,
who will daine the familiaritie
of his ſeruants, reſpectiuely in

termes and degrees to the one
and other conuenient, or by
ſome incident occaſion, as time
and place affoordeth many, or
by the Courtiers qualities. And
ſurely if the Prince be of nature
conuerſable with his ſeruants,
the way to diſcourſe and talke
with him will bee plaine and
needs no art at all: ſince either
himſelf by demanding, recounting
or propounding will offer
occaſion of entertainment. In
theſe accidentall conferences
there can no rule be giuen; and
that which in them is to bee aduertized,
ſhall be noted in ſpeaking
of the occaſions which the
quality of the Courtier may offer,
whereof wee will now begin
to treat.
               Since then theſe ſpeeches are
brought in for the pleaſure and
entertainment of the Prince, it is

cleare, that willingly hee would
paſſe them with ciuill and well
ſpeaking perſons, full of nouelties
and pleaſant deuices to amplifie
and prolong a diſcourſe.
To be Iouial and conceited is a
gift of nature, which receiueth
little helpe by arte, howbeit many
haue attempted to giue precepts
of vrbanity and merriment.
The diſpoſition alſo and
ability of ſpeaking well, is
brought likewiſe from the mothers
wombe, but heerein without
all doubt Art hath a ſpeciall
ſhare, ſince that if by a glibbe
tongue and a hot temperature
of the braine well fraught with
naturall conceits, there be adioyned
a knowledge of many
things: the arte of apt & proper
ſpeech ioined with that which
more importeth and helpeth
iudgement and diſcretion, without

all difficultie he will prooue
commendable and excellent in
diſcourſe.
               Nouelties are gotten by curioſitie,
and though with a learned
Prince, doctrine and reading
be great helpers heerunto,
he muſt not for all this, neglect
the knowledge of ſuch things
as daily do occur, aſwell within
as without his dominions, ſo
that the matter of theſe diſcourſes
may bee ſufficiently ready at
hand; becauſe the disburdened
Prince, allured by ſuch like qualities
will take occaſion to diſcourſe
with him for the time he
ſhall ſtand free from greater
cares. But for that it is no leſſe
neceſſary to offer meat vnto the
queaſie and weake ſtomacks for
natures ſuſtenance, than to the
hunger-ſtarued mawe, and by
deuice of artificiall ſmels and

exquiſite delicacies, prouoke
their appetites: the prouident
Courtier, at houres moſt fit and
time conuenient, be it either after
meales, when not to hinder
true concoction by withdrawing
the vitall ſpirits from the
ſtomack, it is ouerruled by Phyſicke,
that for a while our minds
haue leaue to play, or at ſome
other time when hee ſhall ſpie
the Prince at leiſure (to which
purpoſe diligent attendance in
the preſence much importeth)
hee muſt inſinuate and mooue
ſome of thoſe things which hee
ſhall find moſt apt to pleaſe his
taſte and giue delight, which if
he once perceiue (by vacancy
of greater thoughts) hee take
well, then may he goe on ſafely
and with dexterity glide from
one thing to another as commonly
is vſed in long talke. But

if there ſhall bee no diſpoſition,
as quickly a nimble eied Courtier
will perceiue, noting his actions,
bowed downe with
waighty thoughts, or ſilent not
willing to anſwer, or vſing breuity
to whats propoſed, or elſe
(in ſum) to chop off occaſion,
cut off multiplicity of words,
then, huſht, he muſt retire, and
look for better opportunity, or
more befitting humour in the
Prince, or ſeeke ſome accident
which oftentimes fals out, either
by ſome flying newes, or chances
happening in the city, court
or other countries, which either
by their owne nature, or
ſome intereſt which hee may
haue in them may giue him taſt
or moue him lend an eare to vnderſtand
what is diſcourſed
or variably thought
abroad.

The order that muſt be kept
in conferences of entertainment.
               IT followeth that howſoeuer
there bee an induction of
theſe conferences, to aduertiſe
the Courtier what hee is to obſerue
therein, to make profit by
the ſame: wherefore we ſay,
that the ſcope of theſe ſpeeches
is to pleaſe the Prince, the action
is talke, hee muſt then by
meanes of wordes and reaſoning
endeuour to entertaine &
delight his Prince: and to ſpeak
generally, it is notorious, that
pleaſantneſſe and ieſting commonly
are delightſome, though
it bee true, that in this courſe
there be danger of ſlipping into
ſcurrilitie ſpurd forward by that
vnbrideled deſire of ambition,

to ſee the Prince reſt ſatisfied
without delights; which pernicious
blocke by al meanes muſt
bee remoued, by thoſe whoſe
aime is honour and reputation,
becauſe the profeſſion of a Ieſter
brings with it too baſe and
ignoble eſtimation; wherefore
it is neceſſarie with great diſcretion
to limit bounds vnto this
merriment. Beſides the report
of news and occurrences which
neither moleſt the minde, nor
breed any trouble for any intereſſed
affection, there are other
ſubiects very delightſome
in theſe diſcourſes & conferences,
whereof the pleaſure which
they yeeld giues teſtimonie:
which is not alone out of hiſtories,
but out of Poets and well
digeſted fictions, which we ſee
hearkened vnto and read with
greedineſſe. But becauſe the

condition of humane nature is
ſuch, that wee are not all of one
reliſh, or at all times in one
mood (as wee haue oftentimes
ſaid) it importeth very much to
know the Princes inclination,
and more particularly his humour
then predominant, when
wee are to ſpeake with him: to
the knowledge whereof the accidents
of that day, the matters
handled, or the reports made
vnto him, help very much, becauſe
it will be very eaſie to accommodate
our talke vnto his
taſte, knowing that louers willingly
talke of their loue (but
this with a caution, that there
bee no circumſtance of diffidence
or diſtruſt which may remoue
his minde from entrance
into like diſcourſe) ſouldiers of
warres, the learned of letters,
and the wrathfull of reuenge &

iniurie, and ſo of the like naturall
or incidentall qualities and
humors in the Prince, becauſe
that doing thus, (but ſo that the
cunning bee couert) himſelfe
will miniſter matter of diſcourſe
and be delighted to enlarge the
ſame: yet muſt you vnderſtand
that theſe obſeruations are
meet in caſes of recreation and
pleaſure, becauſe in thoſe of
griefe and ſorrow (beſides that
theſe were ſeruiceable for introduction)
the minde afflicted
would affoord more eaſe; for
ſorrow ſeemes to bee ſuccoured
by breathing foorth her woes.
But you muſt herein deuiſe with
iudgement and dexterous regard,
either how to diuert and
turne theſe troubled thoughts
of the Prince ſome other way,
by application of things more
pleaſing, if at leaſt you ſee him

not willing to perſiſt therein, or
elſe to giue him ſome ſhew that
you condole & haue a feeling of
his ſufferance, or by continuing
it, if you ſee the Prince bee ſo
pleaſed, becauſe the power and
will to proſecute, cut off, or
change a ſpeech vpon euery
ſubiect and in euery caſe, is properly
the Princes due, the Courtier
being bound to ſecond him
and follow where his wil in conference
ſhall lead the way; for otherwiſe
there would follow
contrary effects to his deſires, it
being very well knowen, that
the minde doth no leſſe abhor
to reaſon of theſe things wherunto
the will doth not incline,
than to worke or execute any
thing forced and againſt
the
will.

Of praiſe and flatterie.
               AMongſt all the things that
can be obſerued to be pleſing
vnto any man with whom
we ſhall conferre, there is none
of more efficacie or greater
force than Commendation or
Praiſe, whereof an excellent
Greeke giues good teſtimonie,
who being demaunded what
communication of al other beſt
pleaſed him, auerred with an aſſeueration,
That which cōtained
his commendations, whereof
the Courtier muſt take notice to
obſerue the ſame euen till hee
come to the confines of Flattery,
framing to himſelfe this maxime
& aſſured rule, that Commendations,
or in defect thereof
as wanting matter praiſe-worthy,

an eaſie flatterie is neceſſarie
to whomſoeuer ſerueth. And
although in Tacitus,
                  Lib. 15. Ann. 
                  Seneca
ſaith, Non ſibi promptum in adulationes
ingenium, idque nulli magis
gnarum quàm Neroni, qui ſaepius
libertatem Senecae, quàm ſeruitium
expertus eſſet: He had no
readie wit for flatterie, which
no man better knew than Nero,
who had had oftener triall of
Senecaes libertie than of his ſeruitude
in ſpeech, it is but the teſtimonie
of no good Courtier,
neither in reaſon may we take it
for authoritie, his end making
it very manifeſt, that happily
he had not ſo great knowledge
in matters of philoſophie, as he
wanted skill in the Courtiers art.
I meane not now that by an abiect
and baſe flatterie he ſhould
inſinuate himſelfe into the Princes
fauor, ſince he muſt haue his

eie alwaies fixed on the marke
he aimeth at, which is credit,
and honourable reputation, which
neuer ioyne in companie with
flatterie,Lib. 1. hiſt. wherein faith Tacitus,
turpe crimen ſeruitutis ineſt, there
is the foule ſinne of ſeruitude.
But it is neceſſary to walke vpon
ſuch paths, as hardly will bee
found by him who takes not for
his guide before he enters in, a
grounded iudgement to diſcourſe
on them. Wherefore I
thinke it worth the while, and
not ſuperfluous to ſpeake ſome
thing of this matter for the full
inſtructions of our Courtier; yet
becauſe we can diſcourſe of nothing,
nor giue rules, if firſt wee
know not what our ſubiect is,
we hold it fit to begin vpon this
ground, ſaying, that Adulation
generally is an honour, which either
deſeruedly or vndeſeruedly is

giuen by the inferior vnto the ſuperior,
to the end to pleaſe him for
his owne benefit or intereſt. And
this for the preſent ſhall bee the
definition, the which wee leaue
to examine as not proper to this
place, and only tie the conſideration
to our purpoſe: wee ſay
alſo that commendations or praiſe
is an honour done with wordes, and
vnder this kinde flatterie is contained,
whereof we muſt ſpeake
in this place, ſuppoſing it to be
a falſe praiſe amplified, to the
end aforeſaid, the which becauſe
it is little to purpoſe in this our
treatiſe, we will heere ſerue our
turnes only with the firſt part,
wherein the moſt inward and
eſſentiall nature thereof is contained,
that is, that it is a Commendation:
then will wee examine
the differences, which are
falſe or amplified.
               
               
                  
Inſomuch then as it is Praiſe
or Commendation, it is neceſſary
that it fall vpon ſome good part
in the Prince, ſince the obiect of
praiſe is good parts. The good
parts (becauſe it is now no time
to play the Phyloſopher) wee
ſay are of three ſorts, of the
minde, the body, and the externall.
The good parts of the
minde are vertue and the naturall
powers and faculties, becauſe
we doe not onely praiſe
temperance, fortitude, liberalitie,
&c. but a pregnant and quicke
vnderſtanding, a vigilant and
prouident minde; and becauſe
theſe are ſometimes the efficient
cauſe, or cauſe conſeruant
of the outward parts, it followeth
that praiſing the externall
parts wee commend alſo the
cauſes of them. But to conclude,
the principall commendations

and moſt of all to be deſired, is
that of the vertues of the mind:
true it is that theſe are not of all
men alike priſed and eſteemed,
there being many who had rather
be commended for wealth,
power and honour, than for
wiſedome, magnanimity and
beneficence; nay there be ſome
ſo blind of vnderſtanding, that
had rather be accompted faire,
comely, agile and gallant of body,
than more or as learned as
Ariſtotle, or eloquent as Cicero;
and who doubteth but that it
was more gratefull and pleaſing
to Nero the praiſe of his
ſinging than whatſoeuer other
commendation either of temperance,
modeſty or iuſtice?
And queſtionleſſe if any man
ſhould take vpon him to adde
vnto the female ſex, all thoſe
commendations and applauſes,

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
that pleaſing eloquence
could figure or paint out, but
would abate their beauty out of
it, I thinke there is none but
knowes, how welcome and how
gratefull ſuch honor ſhould be
to any woman. Wherefore
though the true and reall commendations
is principally to be
attributed to the aboue named
good parts, it is notwithſtanding
very neceſſary, if the courtier
will commend with profit
& to be pleaſing, that he praiſe
that whereunto he ſees the
Prince moſt inclined and beſt
to ſatisfie himſelfe, vrging this
as a thing of moſt ſpeciall importance,
aiding himſelfe, with
the knowledge of his nature,
cuſtome and inclination.
               There is yet an other aduertiſement
of great conſequence,
for the better vnderſtanding

whereof we ſay thus, that it is
cleere, praiſe and commendation
is naturally deſired of euery
man, the reaſon is, becauſe
there is in all men an innated
deſire of perfection, the which
not alone in it ſelfe is moſt acceptable
and gratefull, but with
a particular pleaſure makes
thoſe things to bee receiued
which giue teſtimony thereof,
no otherwiſe, thā as we ſee, that
the comming to paſſe of ſuch
things which we haue longingly
deſired, not only to be pleaſing
vnto vs, but withall, euen
the meſſenger of ſuch newes is
very acceptable, and oftentimes
munificently rewarded for his
tidings: and therefore by the
ſame reaſon whoſoeuer commendeth
vs, as a witneſſe of our
perfection, is beloued of vs. But
as in all ratifications falſe teſtimonies

are by vs greatly hated,
in like manner are vntrue commendours,
who once knowen
for ſuch, doe highly diſpleaſe
vs, becauſe we ſeeme not to receiue
commendations or teſtimony
of any perfection,
which we know to be farre from
vs, but rather an vpbraiding
that wee are not ſuch as they
would make vs ſeeme to bee;
beſides the deformity of the
falſhood which is diſcouered
in them, whereupon we gather
the ſmall confidence that wee
may giue vnto them in any other
thing, as falſe and mendacious,
beſides the diſgrace they
fall into, as baſe and vulgar
perſons. Of all this thus much
may be gathered, that we muſt
not only be conſiderate in cō
                  mending,
not to incur ſuſpition
of falſhood, but withall that it

is not alwaies true that Galba is
reported to ſay in Tacitus,
                  Lib. 1. hiſt. that,
adulatio erga Principem quemcumque
ſine affectu peragitur.
Flattery or aſſentation to what
Prince ſoeuer, is done without
affect. Wherefore we ſay, that
the commendations being to
bee credited, it is neceſſary to
ground the ſame vpon ſome
vertue or good part really and
in trueth exiſting in the Prince,
or at leaſt in opinion thought
to be in him, and what commendable
parts are in the prince
hee may eaſily know, who hath
that notice of him, as we ſuppoſe
the Courtier ſhould haue:
but of which of them the Prince
makes moſt eſteeme, muſt by
obſeruance bee learned, noting,
that for the moſt part we
thinke our ſelues beſt indued
with thoſe things whereof we

make profeſſion; the muſitian,
of ſinging well, the Philoſopher
of the perfect knowledge
of naturall cauſes, the Souldier
of the arte of warre; wherein
being praiſed we eaſily beleeue
it, & willingly accept it. Thoſe
which are proper to a Prince,
are, wiſedome, iuſtice, magnificence,
riches, power, glory,
and ſuch like vertues, and qualities
belonging to a perſon of
ſo high degree, from whence
groweth an affect, which wee
call veneration, which doth
meet or encounter his perfection,
and is as a teſtimony (as
wee haue ſaid of praiſe, and
ſhould ſay of all honour) of the
good parts which we eſteem to
be in him; the which teſtimony
by how much it is giuen in
greatneſſe, by ſo much is it
thought his abilities and qualities

doe exceed. Of this kinde
is that of Seianus,
                  Lib. 4. Ann. when he ſaith,
Se ita inſueuiſſe, vt ſpes, votaque
ſua non priùs ad Deos quàm ad
principum aures conferret: The
great ſignes and expectation
of Tiberius, had framed ſuch a
cuſtome in him, that he would
not ſooner offer vp his hopes
and vowes to the gods, than
vnto the eares of Princes, the
which adulation could not with
more cunning haue beene ſet
downe, becauſe hee doth not
only compare, but preferres his
Prince before the gods in a
thing eaſily to be credited: and
ſo ſhewing that which is too
common in experience, that
there bee ſome ſo affectionate
& deuote in their Princes ſeruice,
that forgetting their due
recourſe to God, lay the whole
burden of their hopes vpon

the fauour of their Lord.
               But becauſe what hath beene
ſaid hitherto, conſiſteth in the
credit and teſtimony that the
perſon of the Prince and his
vertues or good parts do yeeld,
we muſt no leſſe conſider how
to draw ſome beleefe and truſt
from the perſon of the Courtier:
and ſurely there is faith giuen
to ſuch whom wee take to
bee of a free and open nature
and who make ſhew of that in
ſpeech which is within the incloſure
of their heart. This opinion
is particularly gotten
by reprehending, for whoſoeeuer
falſely commendeth, doth
it (as we haue ſaid) for his owne
profit; but who freely reprooueth,
ſheweth he hath no minde
of other reſpect or intereſt, neither
will by curring fauour giue
place a iot from his true meaning.

Wherefore an ingenuous
and free reprehenſion is alwaies
accompanied with credit & authority.
Tis true that in this particular
we muſt remember this
maxime,
                  Tac. lib. 4. hiſt. which ſaith, Quando
peſſimis Imperatoribus ſire fine
dominationem, ita quamu is egregijs
modum libertatis placere.
As an euerlaſting rule is pleaſing
euen to the woorſt Emperours,
ſo doth a modeſt kind of
liberty in reprehenſion pleaſe
the greateſt, becauſe if the
Courtier paſſe thoſe bounds in
reproouing, hee may eaſilie
coniecture, what effects would
follow a ſerious ſpeech that
biteth.Lib. 15. Ann. 
                  Si facetiae vbi multum
ex vero traxere, acrem ſui memoriam
relinquunt: If ieſts when
they cary much truth with them
do leaue a bitter memory. Hee
muſt therefore diſpraiſe in a ſupportable

maner, and that may
ſeeme rather a kind of praiſe,
than a iudicious cenſure: which
thing woorthy of ſpeciall obſeruation
is done, not in reprouing
vices, but the exceſſe of ſome
vertue, yet with this aduertizement,
not to expreſſe or name
the exceſſe, by thoſe extreames
which otherwiſe indeed are vices,
and preiudiciall to others,
but by thoſe termes only which
are damageable to the agent,
with the profit of others. As for
example, it is a vertue to be acceſſible
and willing to giue audience,
and not eaſily wearied in
diſpatches; if then one ſhould
ſay vnto the Prince, that throgh
too vehement a deſire to ſatisfie
others, hee ouerchargeth himſelfe
both in mind and body to
the preiudice of his health wher
of he hath no due reſpect; hee

ſhould reproue him with a kind
of flattery. Sobriety and temperate
abſtinence is commendable;
who now would ſhew
that he offendeth in being too
ſtrict in dangering his health,
ſhould ſmoothingly admoniſh
him, and worke two notable effects,
one, that by the reproofe
he gaineth credit, the other that
he diſcouers an affection and
intereſt in the Princes health:
But theſe obſeruations cannot
bee put in practiſe but by a witty,
prouident and wiſe Courtier,
who if ſometimes with an expreſſion
or ſhew of griefe, or a
light anger he ioin theſe admoniſhments
it will greatly increaſe
his credit, becauſe ſuch affections
of freedome and plainneſſe
would wholly remooue and extinguiſh
all ſuſpition of diſſimulation,
whereunto alſo will adde

very much the auoiding of all
affectation, and ſhunning this
decorum and ſeeming-wiſe-grauitie,
in your reprehenſions. But
aboue all, the moſt aſſured way
to ſettle and gaine credit, is alwaies
and in all your actions to
ſhew your ſelfe ſuch as you pretend,
that the Prince may haue
this conceit of you, that you are
an ingenuous, free, and plaine
man. And this is ſo much as I
hold may be obſerued in praiſe
and flatterie, adding this as a
note, that true praiſe when there
is matter and ſubiect for it, is to
be preferred, and in defect or
want therof, to haue immediate
recourſe to adulation or flatterie,
the which conſiſteth in a
little amplifying or enlarging,
and is not altogether diſioyned
from perfect commendations:
But when there is no matter

at all to worke on, it is lawfull to
helpe your ſelfe with that kinde
which makes an attribute of
ſome good parts where none
are, yet with that caution and
circumſpection which wee before
haue ſignified.
            
            
               CHAP. XXI.
Of the ſoundings and trials which
Princes ſometimes vſe with
their Courtiers.
               SVch is the maner then to
praiſe, and ſuch the rule to
temper your conference vnto
the Princes taſte, the which by
often giuing occaſion therof, opens
the paſſage to make a large
progreſſe into his fauour, for
that the ſpeech being a ſpeciall
teſtimonie of our other vertues
and abilities, if happely he
take a pleaſure in talking with

his Courtier, and finde ſufficiencie
and aptneſſe in him of
performance of ſuch things
which doe concerne him neere,
it is not vnlikely but hee may
imploy him in the ſame, whereby
he may obteine ſome extraordinarie
grace, becauſe ſome
time ſuch ſeruices are committed,
which cauſe a full poſſeſſion
of an entire confidence; and
ſuch particularly are the exceſſes
or extreames of ſome affections:
As of ambition in procuring
ſome high degree of honour;
or of couetouſneſſe, gaping
after gaine, or of wrath,
thirſting for immoderate reuenge,
or of loue, longing impatiently
for the fruition thereof:
And theſe I note but for the
preſent, as principall affections
and paſſions, in the which who
is imploied may without great

difficultie ouerrule & triumph
in the fauour of his Prince. But
this fals out moſt commonly
in ſome amorous motion, that
is, becauſe this affection ſtraying
farther then any other, from
the pathway of reaſon, of neceſſitie
there riſeth more exorbitant
accidents, either becauſe
they are more potent in diſturbing,
whereby with a greater ardencie
the obiect is deſired: or
becauſe ſeldome it fals out, that
the pleaſure & poſſeſſion of the
partie beloued, can be obteined
without ſome actions, which
diſrobing the Prince of decency
and decorum, make him faſhion
himſelfe to the condition of
the Courtier, in ſuch ſort that
there followeth a familiaritie as
betweene equals. And true it is,
that theſe performances not falling
vnder the bond of ſeruitude,

and there following neceſſarily
an election or choice,
they are not ſleightly committed
as the other ſeruices which
are ordinarie and of dutie, but
with a carefull regard & a precedent
knowledge of the intention,
which the Courtier hath
to performe and execute the
ſame: whereupon the circumſpect
Prince finding him an apt
inſtrument for his deſire, reſoluing
to lay the burden of the
buſineſſe on his confidence, will
proue and feele by conference,
if hee commanding ſhall finde
him ready and obſequious: and
this is done by ſome with more,
by ſome with leſſe aduiſedneſſe,
according to the iudgement &
dexteritie of the agent, whereupon
it followeth, that hauing
theſe emploiments, it is a moſt
eaſie, and an aſſued entry into

the poſſeſſion of deſired grace:
It is alſo very neceſſary iudiciouſly
to enable your ſelfe to vnderſtand
his very ſignes and
beckes (things which arte cannot
inſtruct without a naturall
perceuerance) and thoſe conceaued,
to make that profit of
them that belongeth. But becauſe
Princes many times ſpeak
not that ſincerely nor frō within,
which outwardly in talk they
make a ſhew of, but rather to
ſound and vndermine the nature
and qualitie of their ſeruants,
make their triall by ſeuerall
meanes; it is a thing of ſpeciall
note therefore, to be heerein
well aduiſed, and able to perceiue
when the Prince reaſoneth
ſincerely, & when couertly,
for the better knowledge wherof
I hold the diſcourſe following
not vnprofitable.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXII.
Meanes how to diſtinguiſh and
come to the knowledge
of theſe trials.
               IF theſe aſſaies ſhall be made
by Princes of ſmall experience,
it will bee no great labour
for the Courtier to diſcouer
them, but becauſe wee haue
preſuppoſed he is to deale with
a perſon circumſpect and caurelous,
we ſay, that the firſt difficultie
is, to haue a feeling that
he is felt, or rather to vnderſtand
and peize the full waight
and meaning of euery word the
Prince ſhall ſpeake, it being
cleere, that diſcourſes to this
end, will paſſe vailed vnder figuratiue
and ambiguous ſpeeches,
not much vnlike to Oracles,
concluding with ſuch obſcuritie

and clowdineſſe, that
the diſciphering and conceit of
them wil be very difficil to him
whom nature hath not giuen a
wit more pregnant, ſharpe and
prouident, than to the ordinarie.
Wherefore this firſt point
falls out within the compaſſe of
our arte, becauſe to be heedy &
watchfull, is not a thing that
precepts can affoord, if nature
liſt not to be bountifull. But vnderſtanding
the force of the
wordes, and perceiuing this
treaty is but to tempt, Art herein
may yeeld great help, in diſcouery
betweene a true and fained
triall, that is, which of them
the Prince doth to the end to
vſe the Courtiers helpe therein,
if happily he accept the charge,
and which of them, but for diſcouerie
of his inclinations and
affections.
               
                  
Firſt therfore when the Prince
purpoſeth but to feele or vndermine,
his deſire is onely
the knowledge of the Courtiers
intentions, whereupon becauſe
he hath the greater intereſt, he
doth it with the more regard
and leſſe feare, but hauing a
minde actually to command
and impoſe ſome charge from
which the Courtier may perchance
retire himſelfe, hee tries
him then more baſhfully and
more warily: heereof it follows
that theſe Soundings are made
with more circumſpection and
more obſcuritie, ſo that not finding
the foord paſable, it ſhall
be in the Princes power to ſtep
backe without danger of diſcouerie.
The other Vnderminings
which are vndertaken by diſtimulation,
& falſly, are only done
to winne the knowledge of the

                  Courtiers nature, albeit they are
no leſſe by a wiſe Prince to be
handled with great dexteritie &
arte; yet becauſe the impulſiue
cauſe bindes not ſo much,
they are done ſomewhat more
plainlie. This is then a probable
ſigne how to diſtinguiſh of
like ſoundings or trials.
               
               But who would doe it yet
more exactly, it is neceſſary he
conſider foure things, that is,
the nature and inclination of the
Prince, the quality of the thing,
whereof the taſte is giuen, the
preſent occaſion in reſpect of the
Prince, and the actions by himſelfe
committed in that Court.
How to come to the Princes
nature and inclination (vnleſſe I
be deceiued) hath ſufficiently
in his place beene declared before.
To vnderſtand the qualitie
of the thing, cannot bee of

that difficulty, that there
ſhould neede many precepts,
and leſſe doth it belong to this
arte to ſet them down, but thus
much may be ſaid, that the nature
and quality of the thing
being perfectly knowen, wee
muſt conferre the ſame with
the propenſity and inclination
of the Prince, meditating whether
any ſuch diſpoſition may
in any likely-hood, ingender
in him ſuch a cogitation or deſire
of the ſame or ſuch like
thing. For example, who
knowing the nature of the
Prince to bee ſterne, ſeuere,
temperatly giuen to his affairs,
abhorring & deteſting laſciuious
pleaſures, ſhould finde him
make a triall in motion, of amorous
thoughts and paſſions
of loue; might well ſuſpect this
motion to bee falſe, for that

comparing the cauſe with the
nature of the Prince, he ſhould
not finde that ſympathie or
correſpondence that belongs.
Howbeit to this conſideration,
it were fit to ioyne that of accidents
or occaſions, becauſe many
times a naturall diſpoſition by
ſome euent or other chance,
may be ſo changed, that who
hath not ſpeciall regard thereunto
ſhall often be deceiued:
as if to a Prince of a quiet
pleaſing nature, forgetfull of
wrongs, there were ſome notable
iniury offered whereby
hee ſhould bee much ingaged
or ſtained in reputation, if hee
ſhould not by his beſt indeuours
procure reuenge, or were
it for ſome other ſpeciall cauſe
he muſt put on reuenge; hee
ſhould bee mightily deceiued,
who either not knowing, or

not aduertiſing ſuch accidents
ſhould ground his iudgement
only in cōparing of the thing,
that is, reuenge, with the nature
of the Prince: Wherefore the
knowledge of occaſions and of
accidents which intercur, is
very neceſſary for diſtinction
of theſe feeling motions. And
this may be obteined by a curious
obſeruation, the which
(leauing as impertinent to
ſearch the ſecrets of his Prince)
as a moſt profitable quality is
highly to bee commended in
the Courtier, for by knowing
many things; he ſhall with the
more facility take the better reſolutions
in many caſes. And
therefore we may not let ſlip in
his fit place to ſet downe the
meanes how with eaſe to come
to the knowledge of all that is
done and ſaid in Court.
               
                  
The conſideration of the
Courtiers proper actions, is alſo
no leſſe needfull in this diſtinction,
for that either they are
ſuch, as eaſily diſcouer his inward
affections and naturall inclinations,
& are taken as open
and free, or elſe ſuch as giue a
ſhew of diſſimulation, and
ſeeme not of themſelues ſufficient
to diſcouer his intentions.
Who then hath ſhewed himſelfe
free and plaine, hath no
reaſon to ſuſpect that he is felt
or vndermined, for his minde
or diſpoſitions ſake already preſuppoſed
to bee knowen by his
actions; but rather to finde
how he is inclined in the acceptance
or refuſall of the execution
of that charge which may be
impoſed vpon him. On the
other ſide, who hath carried
himſelfe circumſpectly, hath

more reaſon to beleeue that the
Prince doth ſound him, to finde
the depth of his conceits and
humour; yet heere we may not
let to ſay, but that theſe plaine
and open Courtiers may be taſted
too, either in things wherin
they are already known as inclining
and diſpoſed, or in their
contraries. In thoſe then wherin
their diiſpoſition is already
knowen, it is moſt true, theſe
trials cannot be for their diſcouery,
but it may well fall out in
that which is the contrary, becauſe
though it ſeeme very probable,
that the contrary diſpoſition
takes away all confidence
to receiue any benefit by their
ſeruice, notwithſtanding, who
is in a longing deſire, vſeth by
all circumſtances to giue his
hope an eaſie paſſage not to
finde a contradiction; and to

conclude, in the ſelfe ſame
things may falſe alarmes and
trials be made. For our minde
being ſo full of lurking corners,
a man can neuer ſo well aſſure
himſelfe of anothers outward
thoughts, that ſome ſcruple or
ambiguitie will not ſtill remain.
But here we muſt make a diſtinction,
becauſe things openly
profeſſed, are either commendable
or wicked: if they be bad,
tis plaine, that for ſuch we muſt
take the diſpoſition of the courtier
that profeſſeth them, as his
actions ſhew for; for he ſhould
be too great an ignorant, who
hauing a vertuous bent and diſpoſition,
would maske it with a
ſhew of vice and wickedneſſe,
neither doth ciuill cuſtome ſuffer
it, as our Moraliſts report,
who make it lawfull to the Artizans
and Mechaniſts to doe

their worke by arte or without
arte. But the Artificer of maners
(if we may terme it ſo) muſt
neuer chuſe to doe any thing
contrary to vertue; for otherwiſe
he ſhould neuer commendably
be faſhioned. Wherefore
who openly makes ſhew to be
enclined well, ſhall neuer falſly
be attempted in his owne profeſſion:
yet thoſe which do but
giue a taſte therof (as hath been
ſayd) may looke for triall now
or then.
            
            
               CHAP: XXIII.
What the Courtier is to do, knowing
and perceiuing theſe ſoundings
or trials.
               AFter the warie Courtier
ſhall haue conceiued that
the Princes conference was only
induced but to feele his pulſe,

or bring him to the crucible of
his triall; and next, whether
this proofe be really made to
make ſome vſe of him, or but to
ſee of what mettle he is made:
it reſteth to ſet downe how hee
is to gouerne himſelfe fruitfully
to make profit of ſuch occaſion
offered. Wee ſay then, that
by what already hath bene ſaid,
it is well knowen to what actions
the Courtiers dutie bindes
him, what actions are not conteined
within the ſame, & what
are directly contrary vnto his
duty. Wherfore ioyning heereunto
another diſtinction, that
is, of falſe or true trials, we may
ſay, that if theſe trials be known
for falſe, falling vpon things
contrary vnto duty in that kind
which may diſtaine his honour,
there is no doubt but reſolutely
and without feare of offence he

may giue the repulſe, denying
that which with his honour hee
can not grant vnto, and which
hee knoweth not if ſeriouſlie
motioned or deſired, or rather
it ſhould be much to the purpoſe,
to ſhew a mind abhorring
all ſuch thoughts. But this is
when you know you are to
deale with a Prince vertuouſly
addicted: for if otherwiſe, you
might put in practiſe the rule
before ſet downe, of fitting your
ſelfe vnto the Princes humour,
ſhewing your ſelfe either artificially
or truely to be like vnto
him. And this may you doe in
all things when theſe attempts
ſhall be made for diſcouerie of
your faſhions onely; ſith there
growing no effect or action
thereupon, there will be no
danger of impeachment in honour:
and beſides, you ſhall

notably gaine the beneuolence
and fauour of the Prince by this
conformity of thoughts and inclination.
But here riſeth a difficultie,
whereunto neceſſarilie
conſideration muſt be had, for
diſcouering a diſpoſition like
vnto that of the Prince, euen in
matters of ſmall commendations,
if it ſhall giue an occaſion
of hope, that the Prince reſoluing
to vſe the helpe of the
Courtier, hee might eaſily obteine
the ſame, a thing which
following, in effect blotteth
and ſtaineth the authour of the
worke, and denying it moues a
diſdaine in the Commander;
and ſo much the greater, perceiuing
himſelfe deceiued by
the Courtiers falſe diſſembling
ſpeech. On the other ſide, to
ſhew himſelfe farre from the
humour of the Prince, is not

anſwerable to that diſcretion
which hath beene ſaid, muſt be
vſed therein, for the better obteining
of his fauour: wherfore
it ſeemeth beſt to keepe the
middle path, neither to diſcouer
too great a woonder, or
too great a niceneſſe of thoſe
thoughts which we ſhall know
in the Prince, either by naturall
inclination or by accident; and
no leſſe altogether to ſeeme ſo
pliable and conformable (particularly
in thoſe which are awaited
on with little credit) as to
giue him hope to find the Courtier
at his pleaſure, to be his inſtrument
in them, although in
ſome things which are repugnant
to his proper benefit, or
not comprized in the ſeruice
belonging to a Courtier, hee
muſt ſhew himſelfe moſt ready,
and more deſirous of the Princes

ſatisfaction, than whatſoeuer
profit of his owne. But if
the feeling motion be ſincerely
made to vſe the Courtier as a
miniſter in ſome thing, wherein
he is not compelled to diſcouer
his own nature and inclination,
but only his will and agreement
to the command, hee muſt in
this alſo diſtinguiſh the matter
and the ſubiect; for if the command
light on commendable
actions, although they be not
within the limits of his duetie,
but meerely contrary vnto his
profit, he muſt offer himſelfe
moſt prone and willing, remembring
that by how much his dudutie
extends but vnto pettie
things, by ſo much the more
ſhall be oblige the Prince to be
anſwerable in loue and affection,
ſince bounden-duties paſſe
but for paiment, but ſeruices

not due, haue place of benefit,
of the which, all men know
which is more acceptable. But
all the difficulty conſiſteth in
the reſolution of that which
ought to be done, when theſe
ſoundings are in diſhonorable
things, or periudiciall to the
marke or ſcope the Courtier
chieflly aimeth at, in which caſe
there is more loſt by the performance,
than can be got by honeſt
ſeruice of long time, and
who pulles backe his aide and
helpe heerein loſeth the confidence
and fauour of the Prince,
it being cleere,Lib. 14. Ann. 4. that grauiorum
ſcelerum, non modò miniſtri, as
Tacitus ſaith, ſed etiam conſcij,
tanquam exprobrantes aſpiciuntur:
Not onely the actors of
great wickedneſſes, but ſuch as
were but made acquainted
therewithall, are looked on as

vpbraiders of the ſame, and that
eſpecially when they ſhall deny
their helpe, in the execution
whereof wee may ſay heerein,
that if there be not an error in
the election of the Prince at
firſt, this difficulty will not happen,
becauſe ſeruing of a vertuous
lord there is no cauſe to
feare commandements leaning
to diſhoneſty. But yet when
either by the foreſaid error, or
by other accident, you ſhall
finde your ſelfe in ſo doubtfull
a caſe of counſell; then muſt
the honorable Courtier by
force of the obſtinate anchor of
vertuous purpoſes, reſiſt the
blaſts of his Princes bad perſwaſions
or commands, conſidering,
that, by obeying him, his
aſſured loſſe ſhould far exceed
the eſtimate of any gaine, which
hee might looke for by his

grace: yet will I not leaue to
giue aduertiſment here, that in
this iudgement of the actions
which may ſeeme contrary to
his purpoſe, or hurtfull, or of
ſmall reputation, the Courtier
muſt not with too ſeuere a cenſure
or a piercing eie examine
or behold the ſame, ſince many
things are permitted and ſufferable
vnder the neceſſity of ſeruice,
ſo that they are not tainted
with that turpitude or ill, being
not performed by a free and
willing choice, or at leaſt, not
with more then eaſily may bee
waſht away, by the greatneſſe
of the benefits, which by the
Princes fauour are many times
obtained: whereby it is cleere,
theſe ſcrupulous & nice Courtiers
can neuer procure confidence,
ſith he merits no fauor,
that is ſo much friend to his

owne commodity, that he will
not at leaſt breake a little of the
ſtocke, but after a moſt miſerable
rate, will ſpend no more
then meere neceſſity conſtrains
him to. To conclude, I muſt
ſay that all ſinnes are not mortall,
and that to the dutie of ſeruice
ſo much is pardonable, as
may for the pleaſure and ſeruice
of his Prince bee done in
ſome things, if not honorable,
at leaſt without ſuch note of infamy,
as in a perſon at full liberty
could not be born out without
paſſing cenſure or incurring
blame. Which theſe are,
cannot particularly be pointed
at, but the iudicious Courtier
by himſelfe may well conceiue
them, and chiefly ſince the
worthineſſe and waight of all
actions conſiſteth in the verdict
and opinion of men. So

that by what is commonly blamed
in other which doe ſerue,
either for denying with too
great ſeuerity, or too too gently
granting and aſſenting to the
prince he may eaſily know what
arts of ſeruice are truely to bee
denied, and wherin ſecurely he
may pleaſe and giue ſatisfaction
to his Lord. But when they
are vnbeſeeming and vnfit to
be put in practice, whoſoeuer
doth more eſteeme his honour
and reputation, (before the
which (vertue excepted) there
is nothing amongſt men more
eſtimable) than his Princes fauour,
ought, at leaſt, if not
ſtoutly and boldly, yet reſeruing
tearmes of modeſty and
regard due betweene parties of
vnequality, deny to be actor
or miniſter therein, annexing
to this deniall notwithſtandding

all obſequious and humble
duty that words can afford
for iuſt excuſe, to ſmooth and
ſweeten as much as may be, the
bitterneſſe which commonly
doth follow ſuch repulſes, reſoluing
firmly in his mind, that
for what ſoeuer hope of benefit,
to ſtand immoueable in his
commendable purpoſe, to doe
or act nothing that may be preiudiciall
or ſtaine to his reputation,
hoping rather that this
might finde ſuch force in the
Princes minde, of a well inclined
nature, a magnanimous &
generous ſpirit, that euen inamoured
with the approoued
goodneſſe of his Courtier, hee
will faſhion him vnto his loue,
and that which ſhould haue
beene a cauſe of hate may bee
the beginning of good will and
fauour; a thing which though

rarely happening, yet is it poſſible,
and ſometimes comes to
paſſe. Yet if this repulſe take
his true and vſuall courſe, ſo
that the Prince indeede conceiue
a hatred againſt the courtier,
either becauſe hee found
him not reſolute and prompt in
that ſeruice, as he expected, or
for knowing of it better then
himſelfe, & ſo by conſequence
more woorthy of his fortunes
or his place, or elſe as hath been
ſaid before, becauſe grauiorum
facinorum non ſolùm miniſtri, ſed
etiam conſcij quaſi exprobrantes
aſpiciuntur. Then, he perceiuing
the Princes ſlight regard and
little fauour, it ſhould be fit
to take ſuch courſe for remedy,
as we heereafter
in ſuch caſes ſhall
ſet downe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXIIII.
Of the ſubſidiary aids and meanes
to obteine the Princes
fauour.
               HItherto hath beene declared,
as I ſuppoſe, ſo much
as a prouident, carefull & wiſe
Courtier may worke of himſelfe,
to the end to obteine his
Princes fauour. And ſurely, if
he ſhall obſerue theſe precepts,
ſeaſoned with that diſcretion
which the effecting of an enterpriſe
(for many reſpects) ſo difficult
and laborious doth require,
it ſhould be much and
very ſtrange, if he procure not
what he hath propoſed, ſince
this alone and none other ſeemeth
the beaten way, which
moſt ſecurely will leade vs to
the poſſeſſion of anothers fauour,
the which yet if it ſhould

be thought impregnable and
inuincible by our proper forces,
it is neceſſarie to call in aid
vnto this aſſault, ſome voluntarie
ſuccours, ſeeking to procure
that victorie by others meanes,
which by our owne labor hardly
we could haue purchaſed, to
the end we let ſlip no meanes,
or leaue any thing vnattempted
which may ſeeme profitable any
wayes vnto our purpoſe.
Who therefore by himſelfe can
not attaine his Princes fauour,
let him procure it by ſome other
aids: but it is requiſit that theſe
ſtand graced with the Prince.
Wherefore there are three ſorts
of perſons who ſeeme apt vnto
this vſe; the Princes kindred,
his friends, his fauoured ſeruants.
Of all theſe we muſt diſtinctlie
ſpeake apart, to the end the profit
may be knowen, that may be

drawen from them, and what
aduertiſements are fit to be obſerued,
that his labor may fruitfully
be employed, and bring
forth that effect which is deſired,
it being notorious, that all
things (ſaue vertue only) may
be either well or ill vſed; wherfore
it is needfull to be skilfull
in the arte and vſe of euery one,
ſo that they may be vſed conformable
to that our chiefeſt
ſcope doth moſt require. It
muſt not therfore be thought
ſuperfluous to entreat of theſe
meanes or helps, becauſe in the
practiſe there do occurre many
things worthy ſpeciall conſideration,
which being vnknowen,
their aid ſhould be to ſmal profit,
or greater detriment of the
Courtier which ſhall vſe them:
And becauſe the inſtrument of
greateſt force and efficacie, in

all reaſon, is that of the kindred,
as moſt neere vnto the Prince
both by the law of God & Nature;
in the ſecond place is that
of friends, and in the laſt, the
Courtiers or fauoured ſeruants:
in the ſame ranke wee will treat
of them, beginning with the
kindred firſt.
            
            
               CHAP. XXV.
Of the helpe which may be drawen
from the Princes kindred for
procurement of his
fauour.
               IT is a work of nature not only
to loue thoſe vnto whom
by neereneſſe of bloud ſhe hath
conioned vs, but thoſe withall
who are by them beloued;
wherefore if the Prince by this
diſpoſition bee not induced to
entertaine the Courtier into his

ſeruice, at leaſt the fauour of
theſe kindred may giue occaſiſion
thereof, who vſing him in
affaires which happely they
haue in cōmon with the Prince,
may by little and little inſinuate
and promote him into his ſeruice,
or finally they may prefer
him by interceſſion and mediation,
which iuſtly may be held
of ſo much efficacie as the condition
of the party requiring the
ſame is thought of worth, wherby
the Courtier oftentimes in
verie ſhort ſpace attaines to that
which by a long courſe of ſeruice
by himſelfe he ſhould hardly
procure: beſides to bee ſheltred
vnder the fauor of the kindred
is a cauſe of his ſpeciall reputation
in the Court, through
the abilitie hee may haue by
meanes of them to hurt his enemies,
and helpe his friends and

confidents. This then is profit,
which by the fauour of the
Princes kindred, may with great
likelihood bee expected. But
becauſe ſo it hath pleaſed God
almoſt in all things to make an
intermixture of the good with
the badde, and of profit with
his contrarie, that he might bee
the more commendable, who
with diſcretion can make a difference,
or wiſely make his
choice, wee muſt heerein conſider
ſome things, the which either
neglected or not aduerted
may turne to the great preiudice
of the Courtier. Wee ſaie
then that the Princes kindred
are either men or women, and
both the one and the other are
either yoong or of competent
age: As for the women if they
be of tender and freſh yeeres, by
familiarity with them firſt groweth

ſuſpition, which of it ſelfe
were cauſe ſufficient of the
Courtiers ouerthrow, and chiefly
by the occaſion, which is
offred to the enuious to miſinterpret
actions in ſo perillous a
matter, and by ſuggeſtions ſtill
to giue greater cauſe of doubt.
Beſides this (howbeit, I preſuppoſe
the Courtier of honorable
carriage, and friend to right, and
therefore well reſolued in himſelfe)
if wee muſt abſtaine from
other mens wiues or women, it
is much more required towards
thoſe who are naturally conioined
to the Prince in bloud; yet
for all this, experience maketh
it too plaine, that euen the moſt
auſterely minded, & moſt firme
and ſtrongly ſetled in their
purpoſes, haue oftentimes giuen
place to the enticements of
alluring occaſions: and ſurely

he who knowes not how much
the practiſes of a beautious
Dame may entender and mollifie
the hardened minde of a
man not yet ſurcharged with
maturitie, giues ſigne of little
knowledge in the worldes affaires,
chiefly adding to natural
inclination, a little ſpurre of ambitious
vanitie, ſeeing alſo that a
man may eaſily bee enticed by
the occaſion that fortune giues,
ſo neerely to intrinſecate himſelfe
with perſons ſo farre aboue
the reach of his condition, to
ſtrengthen and vnite the hopes
which happely by ſuch like
meanes they may conceaue; as
we ſee in Seianus, who by the
entrie and opportunitie which
the familiaritie of Druſus wife
gaue him, grew ſo confident to
plot the death of the innocent
husband, how to obteine her to

his wife, and to be ſucceſſor in
in the Empire of Rome, things
which moſt eaſely, though moſt
wickedly, fall in imagination,
but moſt ſpeciall where the
woman may be the inſtrument,
whoſe honour once obtained,
all things elſe are eaſily entreated;Lib. 4. Ann.
for Tacitus ſaith wel, Foemina
amiſſa pudicitia alia non abnuerit.
But on the other ſide, albeit
men ſhould haue their
mindes well fortified with continencie,
ſo that in themſelues,
as of their proper motion there
were no feare, (though they as
armed with ſuch weapons, may
lawfully preſume ſome thing of
their valor) the occaſions which
by the women themſelues are
offered, and the neceſſity which
many times they do impoſe are
ſpecially to be conſidered; the
examples are infinite, but that

of Siluius in Tacitus, who was
ſo farre beyond all bonds compeld
by the vnbridled & head-ſtrong
luſt of Meſſalina, that in
the end he was enforced to take
her to wife, almoſt vnder the
noſe of her husband Claudius
the Emperor, may ſerue as manifeſt
enough in my conceit for
a ſufficient document and warning
vnto others. But if through
age there ſhall be ſuch a ripeneſſe,
ſo that there be no cauſe
of feare in that behalfe, their fauour
then in reaſon is much to
be eſteemed, conſidering how
profitable vnto infinite the protection
and authoritie of Liuia
was, with Augustus and Tiberius
both.
               Now as concerning the menkinde;
if they be of yong yeers,
and ſubiect to the errors which
the heat of youth and vnexperiency

of manie things doth
bring with it, it is not amiſſe to
abſtaine from conuerſing with
them, or at leaſt not ouermuch;
for if they performe any thing
iudiciouſly and praiſe worthie, it
is attributed to the good diſpoſition
of their nature, and euery
one (a common accident to
thoſe of high degree, and Fortunes
fauourites) applaud and
giue the praiſe alone to them:
but if they chance to ſlip awrie
or erre in any thing, ſtepping aſide,
as yoong men are accuſtomed,
preſently the blame is laid
either on the badde example or
corrupt counſell of ſuch as were
moſt neere to them in conuerſation
and familiaritie: and this
is the damage and the danger
both. The profit on the other
ſide is of no great conſequence,
becauſe, through want of yeers

they neither haue knowledge,
and leſſe authoritie, to doe any
fauour, or rather they dare not,
eſpecially in matters of any moment,
naturally a kinde of baſhfulneſſe
ouer-ruling youth, with
a reuerence vnto their elders
and to their betters, that in their
preſence ſcarſely they will moue
their lips, or finde their tongue:
and this wee ſee in practiſe amongſt
yoong nephewes and
yoonger brethren, but chiefly
with the children themſelues,
and moſt of all, if the Prince
their father be by nature ſeuere
and ſterne.
               Wherefore it followeth, that
the grace of the male kindred of
riper yeeres is truely profitable,
becauſe theſe by their loue
(which is preſuppoſed) ioyned
with their age, know how; & by
their authoritie can be beneficiall

and fruitfull in their fauour
to the Courtier: howbeit, enuy
no leſſe attending on their fauor,
than it awaiteth the Princes
grace, it ſhalbe neceſſary to
conſider how this may either be
eſchewed, or els what armes the
Courtier muſt put on to confront
the ſame, that it proue not
an impediment to his deſſeignes.
But this heereafter in
his fit place ſhall bee largelie
handled.
            
            
               CHAP. XXVI.
Of the helpe which may be drawen
from the Princes friends.
               THe like profit and vſe may
bee hoped for and expected
from the Princes friends,
as from his kindred, the reaſons
ſeruing almoſt both alike,
though theſe in ſome things

may be thought to be preferred
in others, yet they come
behind, for touching affection
it is moſt cleere that thoſe in
fauour and beloued of the kindred,
eſpecially neereſt in blud,
are more reſpected then the fauourits
of a friend, becauſe they
incline more, and deſire the
good rather of thoſe then theſe.
Wherefore to haue familiarity,
to bee vſed kindely and held in
truſt and confidence with the
kindred, doth much more eaſily
lay open the entrance to the
Princes fauor. But on the other
ſide, the friends come neerer
in equalitie, than the kindred
doe, eſpecially than thoſe of
vnderage, whereof it followeth,
that they ſpeake more confidently,
and with leſſe ſecuritie
are their requeſts and fauours
denied, the which is often done

without anie great difficulty
vnto the kindred. Wherefore
the friends in theſe performances
are to bee preferred, as daring
more, and leſſe vſed to denials
or repulſe. Whereupon,
their aid chiefely conſiſts in interceſſion
to obtaine ſome fauour,
or to preferre into ſeruice.
But in this particular you muſt
obſerue and beware, that theſe
friends bee not the Princes equals,
or in any thing, (but
principally in quality of ſtate,)
Concurrents or Competitors,
becauſe in this caſe ſuch protection
would cauſe the Courtier
to bee ſuſpected and miſtruſted
of his Prince: the example
is at hand, that no man
who by the mediation of a Cardinall
is receiued into the ſeruice
of any other of them, and
continueth the dependancie &

protection of his preferrer, ſhall
euer bee in perfect confidence
with his Lord. The reaſon
heereof is grounded on the
conformity or equality of their
intereſts in the Papacy, which
make them liue more heedily
and full of ielouſie, ſo that the
ſeruice of any man, dependant
vpon an other cannot ſatisfie
them, nor but breed great ſuſpition;
the like may be vnderſtood
of other Princes with
whom the fauour done for their
ſake who are either their concurrents
or like in eſtate, will
neuer bee profitable to the
Courtier. Wherefore theſe
friends muſt be of a degree inferiour,
that is, ſubiects or ſeruitors
(but not domeſticall or
aſſigned of his family) becauſe
theſe haue authority by his
friendſhip and depending on

him as on their ſuperiour, are
his confidents cleere of ſuſpition.
            
            
               CHAP. XXVII.
Of the helpe that may be
drawen from the Princes
ſeruants.
               THe teſtimonie that a beloued
ſeruant may make (for
of ſuch an one we ſpeake) of the
conueniency and aptneſſe the
Courtier hath in ſeruice, may
bee of ſpeciall helpe for his induction,
and thus much is common
to him with the friends &
kindred of the Prince. But a
fauored ſeruant hath yet one
commodity more, which is,
that there being many things
(as it is preſuppoſed) belonging
to the Prince, committed
to his charge, he may in ſome

of them ſubſtitute the Courtier,
or vſe his helpe in them,
whō he purpoſeth to aduance,
and ſo by little and little lift
him vp and ſet him forwards in
the degrees of the Court, and
by inſinuation bring him into
fauour, ſo that by the relation
of his ability in ſeruice, and by
making him partaker in his
owne office and charge, I ſay
the ſeruant in grace may greatly
aide the new Courtier.
               But to know how to compaſſe,
deſerue and obtaine the
helpe and protection of theſe
fauourits, there is vſe of a moſt
exact prouidence and great
diſcretion: becauſe their deſire
to continue ſtill in the firſt
rancke breedeth in them a kind
of ielouſie and ſuſpition, that
for the moſt part they had rather
doe contrary offices fearing

leſt others ſhould ſupplant
and degrade them from
their firſt honours, whereupon
it commeth ſeldome to paſſe,
that like ſuccours are offered
by any, but ſuch as are well aſſured
to be firmely eſtabliſhed
in their Princes fauour: howbeit
euen theſe (who well conſiders
it) cannot ſo quietly repoſe
themſelues, but there will
ſtill remaine a lurking corner
for timidity. Wherefore they
haue great reaſon to goe well
aduiſed, & diſcreetly to worke
in the preferment of any one,
and our warineſſe and skil muſt
be no leſſe how to auoid and
ward this doubt, by aſſuring
them, that in their fauouring
vs, they need not feare any preiudice
to themſelues; the which
may be thus, firſt by all meanes
poſſible to couer and keepe

cloſe, the quickneſſe and viuacity
of the minde and ſpirit, for
a wiſe man principally hath regard
and feareth that, as being
apt to take occaſions, and by
himſelfe although but weakely
helpt, may ſet vp a ſcaling ladder
with his qualities to greater
matters. Next, to make profeſſion
of eternal gratitude and
dependancy on them, & by effects
full of obſequious ſhewes
openlie to teſtifie as much.
Then not to ſhew ſo much courage
as to dare aduenture further
then they ſhall lead you by
the hand, or ſet your courſe by
their preſcription; vntill the
time your fauour gotten with
the Prince be ſuch, as may aſſure
you of your proper force, the
which I wiſh you ponder well
before you come vnto the
proofe thereof: becauſe if any

man before his time ſhall goe
about to ſeparate or withdraw
himſelfe from vnder ſafe protection,
and like a bird not fluſh
ſhall take his flight, his downefall
and his ruine will eaſily follow,
for the other perceiuing
that he hath foſtred a Corriual,
happily by the authority which
he yet reteineth with the Prince
may fruſtrate all the hopes you
haue of further aduancement
in that ſeruice; wherefore it is
neceſſary that this progreſſe be
gnomon-ſhadow like, inuiſible in
his motion, and that the growth
may then be ſeene, when it is
fully growen, and of himſelfe
he may defend and vnderſhore
the ſame, and ſo endeuour not
to make his firſt experience, but
as it were vpon occaſion, by
ioint commiſſion with an other
man, which oftentimes make

offer of themſelues to thoſe
which wiſely watch their times,
knowing how eaſie a thing it is
to fall into diſgrace with Princes
whom, you ſhall neuer ſo
ſincerely ſerue, but either by
themſelues, or by the malice of
ſome other, you ſhall incurre
diſpleaſure or diſlike in minde,
which eaſily may be recouered,
by him who knowes to take the
benefit of opportunities.

How to keepe in fauour once
obtained.
               HItherto (in my opinion)
we haue ſufficiently declared
vnto the Courtier the
way and meanes how to compaſſe
and obtaine the Princes
fauour: whereof at length,
ſuppoſing hee hath gotten full

poſſeſſion, it reſteth now to
giue inſtructions, how he may
preſerue and keepe it, ſince he
ſhall gaine no leſſe commodity,
and be aſmuch commended for
the well preſeruing it, then hee
was by the happy procuring
thereof, the obtaining many
times depending vpon accident
and chance, but the maintenance
of it vpon iudgement
and diſcretion, the which is ſo
rarely found amongſt men, that
infinite is the number of thoſe
who hauing liued ſometime in
grace as fauorites and Priuados
to their Prince, in the end come
tumbling topſie turuy downe
from ſo high a type of honour,
whereof Seianus doth ſufficiently
giue teſtimony, who for long
time not minion, but maſter ouer
Tiberius, at laſt cloſed vp the
period of his ſeruice with a moſt

vnhappy end. Criſpus Saluſtius
a deereling alſo to Tiberius,
                  Tac. ann. lib. 3.
                  Aetate prouecta, ſpeciem magis in
amicitia principis quam vim tenuit;
idque Moecenati acciderat:
Growen in yeeres held rather a
ſhew then any ſubſtance in the
Princes fauour; the like hapned
to Mecenas, who of all others
was moſt deere to Auguſtus,
whereof Tacitus rendring a reaſon,Ann. 3.
                  fato, inquit, potentiae raro ſempiternae,
ſaith it is by fate decreeed,
that great fauors are ſeldom
of long continuance, and heereof
giues the cauſe. An ſatias capit,
aut illos, cum omnia tribuerunt;
aut hos, cum nihil reliquum
eſt quod cupiant; whether both
as it were at a non-plus, either
the Princes hauing giuen all
they can, or the Courtiers,
when there is nothing left, that
they may beg.
               
                  
Now heerein were manie
things to be conſidered of: as
firſt, if handling things which
are within our choice, we ſhould
referre the cauſe thereof to fate;
or granting that, if it were conuenient,
to aſſigne a reaſon, as
if from fate cauſe were giuen,
and chiefly an electiue cauſe,
depending vpon mans arbitrement.
But becauſe theſe ſhould
be too far from the matter now
in hand, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay,
That the reaſons by him ſet
downe, ſeeme to be of no truth,
or to be the leaſt part of thoſe
which might be brought, that
is, cauſes of the leaſt part of
thoſe effects which commonly
happen in this particular, as
ſhall be declared, becauſe firſt
in my opinion, none would ſuffer
himſelfe to be perſwaded,
that Princes vſe to baniſh from

their fauour a fauoured ſeruant,
becauſe of the abundance of
benefites beſtowed on him,
knowing, as the Moralists doe
teach vs, that the benefactour
loueth him moſt, to whom hee
hath beene moſt bountifull, not
recompenſed by equalitie of
loue; ſo that it is not only falſe,
that there ſhould grow a hatred
in the giuer becauſe of his great
benefits beſtowed, but the contrary
is moſt true, that by this
action there ſpringeth an eſpeciall
beneuolence in the benefactor
towards the fauourite, as
his creature, and (as it were)
worke of his hands, & as his teſtimonie
of the practiſe of a vertuous
action or deed. For if Nature
herſelfe brought not forth
the effect of this loue for the
reaſon alleadged, election and
free choice doubtleſſe would

produce the ſame, becauſe who
doth not perceiue how ſimple
he ſhould be, who by many benefits
hauing obliged one vnto
him, would voluntarily make
choiſe to loſe him? Wherefore
it is not true, that Satias capiat
Principem, quod omnia tribuerit:
the Prince is at a ſtand, hauing
giuen as much as he can.
               Neither is it true alſo, that
the Courtier hauing receiued ſo
many benefits of his Prince, that
there is no more place of further
expectation, ſhould bee a
cauſe on the Courtiers part, to
make, that potentiae ſint raro ſempiternae;
great fauours ſhould be
ſeldome euerlaſting.Lib. 4. Ann. For albeit
Tacitus in another place ſaith.
beneficia eouſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      gratae ſunt dum
videntur exolui poſſe, vbi multum
anteuenêre, pro gratia odium
redditur: good turnes are ſo far

acceptable, as there is poſſibility
of requital; when they grow
greater, in ſtead of thanks, hatred
is returned. Yet it proueth
falſe in true nobilitie and gratefull
mindes, in whom loue and
regard to benefactors groweth
in true counterpoiſe with the
grace and benefits receiued, or
rather doth ſurpaſſe it: for hee
who can not with effects be correſpondent
to the fauour done,
muſt yet at leaſt deuiſe to make
ſome ſhew of an inward gratuitie,
and as wrath is not contented
to manifeſt the wrong in
that meaſure it receiueth it, but
in deſire of reuenge reteineth a
farre greater ſcope; in like ſort,
that facultie wherein thankfulneſſe
and gratitude reſide, doth
not deſire by nature (which
makes vs euer ſtriue to be more
than other men) onely to giue

equall recompenſe with the benefit,
but much more then what
hath beene receiued, ſupplying
want of outward meanes, with
abundance of inward good wil:
ſo that in loue he anſwereth not
alone in iuſt proportion to his
dutie, but by the foreſaid reaſon
endeuours to outſtrip the
ſame. Thus much is ſayd to
ſhew the falſhood of that reaſon,
the which though it ſhould
be granted, the cauſe would eaſily
appeare; whereby ſeruants
ſometimes euen voluntarily depriue
themſelues of that fauour
which they reteine with Princes.
But there reſteth yet a
doubt, how it comes to paſſe,
that ſo often times the fauorites
fall in dſgrace with their Lords:
and this is that which for the
moſt part is common, whereof
the examples of Seianus, of

                  Criſpus Saluſtius, and Moecenas,
ſet downe by Tacitus, giue euident
teſtimonie. Whereupon
it appeareth, that in reaſon we
can not reſt our ſelues vpon
theſe cauſes, and that therefore
it were neceſſary we ſee if there
be any others yet more true and
of greater conſideration, which
we will endeuour to diſcouer in
the proceſſe of our diſcourſe,
ſaying in the meane time, that
the originall of the foreſayd
loſſe may grow either from the
Prince or from the Courtiers,
comprehending vnder the ſame
name aſwell the kindred as the
Priences friends; the reaſons,
as it ſhall appeare, ſeruing all alike:
and therefore we muſt aduert
both what muſt be obſerued
with the Prince, and what
likewiſe with the Courtiers,
peaceably and without danger

to keepe that fauor, which with
ſo great paines and induſtrie
hath beene procured.
            
            
               CHAP. XXIX.
What is to be obſerued with the
Prince for the continuing
in his fauour.
               THere are three thinges
which ſeeme neceſſarie to
bee obſerued with the Prince;
the firſt is, that the fauor being
obteined by diligence and ſatiſfaction
giuen in ſeruice, he perſeuere
and goe forward in the
ſame with the ſame termes. The
which thing not onely by thoſe
of meane capacitie, but by
great Courtiers many times to
their greater detriment is neglected.
Tacitus ſaith of Seianus,
that nimia fortuna ſocors factus
eſt: ouer-great fortune had made

him negligent, a thing for two
reaſons very dangerous; firſt,
the heat of your ſeruice relenting,
the Princes loue cannot but
grow luke-warme; next becauſe
by this meanes you giue occaſion
to ſome other more diligent
and carefull to make his entry;
wherefore it followeth neceſſarily,
in no caſe to leaue off anie
vſuall obſeruances, nor at anie
time to make ſhew of leſſe feruencie
in ſeruice: which is very
requiſite, becauſe if the hope of
fauour be the cauſe of a diligent
and commendable ſeruice, by
how much more ought the ſecure
poſſeſſion of the ſame,
cauſe the continuance therein?
The ſecond aduertiſement is,
no more to ſhew, then to be in
deed, an vpright and honorable
man, I meane for no priuate
reſpect to bee inticed to abuſe

the fauour of his lord, either by
making ſale thereof, by vniuſt
oppreſſions, or offering violence
to pleaſe the vnbridled
appetites of other men and
ſuch like, to the damage and
preiudice of any man, becauſe
ſuch like actions can by no
means be pleaſing to the Prince,
aſwell for the diſcouerie of an
euill qualitie in him that performeth
them, of whom it is
to be coniectured he cannot in
reaſon bee aſſured: as for the
wound that by ſo bad a friend
he receaueth in his reputation,
whereof how much Princes
make account, or at leaſt ought
to eſteeme Tacitus teacheth ſaying,Ann. l. 4.
                  Caetera principibus ſtatim
adeſſe, vnum inſatiabiliter parandum
proſperam ſui memoriam:
Princes are in poſſeſſion of all
other things at their will, but

one thing they muſt inſatiablie
ſeeke after (that is) to leaue a
happie memorie behind them.
And more plainely in an other
place; Caeteris mortalibus in eo
ſtare conſilia, quid ſibi conducere
putent: Principum diuerſam eſſe
ſortem, quibus praecipua rerum ad
famam dirigenda: other mens
conſultations only tend to their
profit, but it falleth out otherwiſe
with Princes, whoſe actions
chiefly are to bee directed to
fame and reputation. The third
& laſt obſeruation in this point
is, not one iot to diminiſh the
reuerence and duty towards the
Prince, nor becauſe of ſpeciall
confidence to preſume to vſe
familiaritie. And for certeine, I
haue bene aduertiſed by a moſt
inward fauorite of a great Prince
in Italy, that by this one obſeruation
hee profited much, and

that the ſame Prince vſed publikely
to ſay, that in ſo manie
occaſions of familiaritie, he ſeemed
ſtill more freſh, & like one
but newly entred into his ſeruice:
the reaſon heereof is, becauſe
obſequious reuerence is
at all times pleaſing, as witneſſing
a ſuperioritie in the perſon
to whom it is vſed. And as affectation
is to be eſchewed, ſo
to arrogate or attribute too
much, can by no meanes bee
pleaſing to the Prince; for as
before vpon other occaſion wee
haue alledged:Tacit. hiſt. li. 4. 
                  Quemadmodum
peſſimis principibus ſine fine dominatio,
ita quamuis egregijs modus
libertatis placet: As a continuall
rule is pleaſing euen to the
woorſt Emperours; ſo no leſſe
pleaſing is a modeſt kinde of
plainneſſe, euen to the greateſt
men: wherefore the Courtier

muſt bound himſelfe within the
limits of his owne condition,
which he ſhall eaſily doe if hee
often call to minde, that the entrance
into familiarity with his
Prince is granted him as a fauour,
not as a due, and to the
end he may vſe it, not that hee
ſhould vſe it; and that in manie
things the apparance and reputation
to be able to doe or performe
them, is better, then willingly
to come to the actuall
execution of them.
            
            
               CHAP. XXX.
What is to be obſerued with other
Courtiers, and the maner
how to make them
his friends.
               THat part which comprehendeth
his office or carriage
towards other courtiers, is

farre more hard; wherefore it
is fit we diſcourſe thereof more
at large. Firſt it is neceſſary, if it
be poſſible, to make them our
friends & confidents, or at leaſt
not to be our enemies; the reaſon
is, becauſe either directly or
indirectly they may doe ſome
things, whereby our fauor with
the Prince may be diminiſhed,
yea, & happely wholly diuerted
aſwell through the inconſtancy
of the minds of men, as becauſe
no man liues ſo void of errour,
that may not in ſome thing giue
diſguſt vnto his lord, who many
times with too great an impreſſion
receiueth that which
malitiouſly is ſuggeſted in an others
diſgrace. The obtaining
them to friend, is wrought, either
through benefit or hope.
The Courtiers may diuerſly be
pleaſured by a fauored ſeruant,

as by the aſcribing much vnto
them, by the preferring them
into ſeruice, by promotion, or
by the procuremēt of ſome fauor
for them. The chiefeſt way
of winning theſe mens loue,
is to preferre them to be of the
Princes houſholde, becauſe by
this meanes he maketh them his
Creatures and dependants, of
whom he may make ſpeciall vſe
in his occurrences as men greatly
bound vnto him, of whom
wee will treat in his place, ſhewing
what profit is drawen from
ſuch kinde of friends. But it is
good to note, not to preferre
men of too great parts, for theſe
grounding their fortunes vpon
their owne deſerts eaſily forget
that bond. And ſuch are the
perfect and true Noble men,
the rich, and thoſe excellent in
any ſpeciall ſcience, arte or honorable

quality. Wherefore
he muſt preferre ſuch as are of
the meane, in birth, faculty and
quality, becauſe the falling into
the other extreame is as vitious,
the reaſon is, for that many
times there are ſome perſons fauoured,
who do ſmall credit, or
rather diſgrace their preferrour:
howbeit, there bee ſome that
hold it for a good rule, to receiue
into their ſeruice the moſt
vnapteſt people, as men neither
of bounty nor valour, that by
this touch, their owne woorthineſſe
may be the better knowen,
imitating in this point Auguſtus
of whom it is ſaid:Tacit. li. 1. Ann. 
                  Tiberium
ab eo non caritate, aut reipub. curâ
ſucceſſorem adſcitum, ſed quoniam
arrogantiam ſaeuitiam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      eius
introſpexiſſet, comparatione deterrima
ſibi gloriam acquaeſiuiſſe:
Tiberius was not choſen ſucceſſor

to the ſtate by him either for
affection to him, or care of the
Common-wealth, but perceiuing
in him arrogancie and crueltie,
he would by ſo bad and
vnequal compariſon, be thoght
the more glorious afterward:
but this is not befitting in the
Princes ſeruice, and for the reaſon
alledged were dangerous.
The ſame care muſt he haue in
the promoting into any great
charge, thoſe who already are
preferred into the houſhold either
by others, or by himſelfe,
or by the Princes owne choice,
and aboue all things, that hee
beware of men that haue ſpirit
and life in them; for theſe no
leſſe watchfull than ready may
at one time or other by their diligent
obſeruation watch their
opportunitie ſo well, that they
may degrade him from his firſt

honours: and doubtleſſe of all
the reſt this qualitie is moſt to
be feared, becauſe it ſeemes not,
that a Princes fauor by any better
meanes is obteined, than by
this alacrity & liuelineſſe, which
are true ſignes of valor and abilitie
to performe many things
which to others would ſeeme
impoſſible; whereupon it is
iuſtly ſaid of theſe, that excitantur
ad meliora magnitudine rerum:
they are encouraged to
greater matters by great imploiments:
whereas for the moſt
part hebeſcunt alij, others grow
blunt and dull. Wherefore the
Courtier muſt haue ſpeciall care
to beware of ſuch like rockes,
that he may anchor free & void
of danger in poſſeſſion of the
fauour alreadie obteined; aduerting
further, that in his aduancement
of others he be not

ſo prodigall in their commendations,
that it be preiudiciall
to his owne commoditie. But
hereof more at large hereafter.
               The laſt meanes how to benefit
the Courtiers, conſiſteth
in obteining either for them or
their friends ſome fauours or
ſutes, which he muſt often procure,
that he may the more entirely
binde them vnto him: finally
al theſe aduertiſements do
preſuppoſe an abilitie in the
Courtier to receaue theſe fauors
and benefits of his Prince; in
which caſe for that ſome are
found (as hath bene ſaid) ſomewhat
hard and vntractable towards
their ſeruants, it is not vnneceſſary
to conſider how the
Courtier may draw from the
Prince, though vnwilling, thoſe
fauours hee deſireth either for
himſelfe or his friends.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXXI.
The meanes how to obteine of the
Prince thoſe fauours and grace,
which are deſired.
               THe procuring of fauours
from the Prince is both
profitable and honorable vnto the
Courtier: profitable, by the benefit
which followeth either to
himſelfe or to thoſe for whom
he obteineth them, who by this
meanes hee maketh much beholding
vnto him. Honorable,
becauſe he is accounted a fauorite,
who hath his Princes wil at
his diſpoſe, and can compaſſe
thoſe fauours which hee pleaſe
either for himſelfe or his friends
& dependents. Wherfore when
the nature of the Prince is of
that kinde which is found in
ſome with great commendations,

though yet but ſeldome;
that is, enclined to beneficence,
he ſhall haue no great need either
of precepts or of arte, more
then onely in ſhewing a modeſtie
in his requeſts, that in no
ſort hee doe manifeſt the leaſt
pretention of expectation, as of
dutie from the Prince, as alſo
not to bee too frequent in theſe
offices, and not to deſire things
ſo impertinent, that woorthely
they may receaue the repulſe.
But when the Prince is neere or
hard in granting fauours, either
becauſe he will not exceed
the limits in doing good vnto
his ſeruants, as doubting they
ſhould abandon him, or to
keepe them in awe that they
grow not ouer confident, or for
the ſmall eſteeme hee makes of
them, or finally for feare they
ſhould ſell his fauours to ſome

other; in theſe caſes arte is neceſſarie.
Wherefore if the hand
be cloſed, fearing to bee forſaken,
it ſhall helpe much to ſhew
a retentiue memorie and gratitude
for benefits, with a greater
deſire to bee ſeruiceable after a
reward then before. And certes
it ſeemeth iuſt and true, that in
a minde well borne and of good
education and qualitie, a preſent
reward worketh greater effects
than a future hope. To
conclude, to profeſſe to runne
one and the ſame fortune with
his Prince, and to die in the ſeruice
of him & his houſe, ſeemeth
to be a conuenient & proportionate
remedie againſt this
euill. To the ſecond, the ſame
modeſtie continued from his
firſt entrance, euen to that degree
wherein the Courtier ſhall
be found, helpeth much, not

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
ſhewing any alteration at all, or
diminution of dutie or reuerence,
as before hath beene noted.
But if the Prince be ſtrict
and drie-fiſted in his fauors, for
the ſmall reſpect which naturally
he hath of his ſeruants, the
Courtier hath but a weak hope,
where there is ſuch an humour.
Wherefore it is neceſſary either
to endeuour that the Maſter
change copie and ſtile in leting
him ſee qualities of woorth,
at leaſt for the affect and aptneſſe
to his ſeruice, woorthy to
be regarded, or els, this not ſucceeding,
to anſwer him proportionally
with the ſame termes
of light eſteeme or reſpect of
him; yet ſo, if it be as doubting
leſt his fauours ſhould be ſold,
you muſt obſerue that rule aboue
ſet downe, which (in fine)
conſiſteth in ſetting the honour

and reputation of the Prince
before your eies, and not to abuſe
the free libertie you haue
obteined to diſpoſe thereof.
               But that hardneſſe which
groweth by nature, not enclined
to liberalitie or beneficence,
is hardeſt of all the reſt
to be ouerruled: and truly it is
euident, that there bee ſome
from whom it is impoſſible directly
to deriue any fauour;
wherefore it is fit to vſe arte, and
wiſely to inſinuate occaſions
and reaſons for the fauours he
deſireth, and to attend opportunities,
which are eaſily found
by him who continually or for
the moſt part is in preſence of
his Prince, faining ſometime
when need ſhall be, to haue no
affect, motion or deſire of the
contrary, and diſcreetly to vſe
himſelfe in this ſiniſtrous courſe,

chiefly when to this naturall
niggardlineſſe, there is any ſuſpition
of the Courtiers fidelity
adioyned. True it is, that heereof
it comes to paſſe, that benefits
are not obtained from ſuch
Maſters but by length of time,
and pining expectation, that
there is great patience required
in the ſeruant, who in requitall
heereof oweth him ſmall duty,
being more beholding to his
owne artificiall cunning and
dexterity, then to the good will
of the Prince; howbeit, it is neceſſary
ſo much as may be, to
conceale this affect or motion,
and to conclude all ſpeeches
with him, with a gratious conge
and giuing thanks; hic eſt enim
finis omnium, cum dominante ſermonum,
                  14. ann.
ſaith Tacitus: for ſuch
muſt bee the concluſion of all
ſpeeches with Princes. Heereof

alſo it followeth that euen the
Princes oftentimes receiue proportionall
acknowledgments;
for nature herſelfe wil not ſuffer
that any man ſhould ſerue, either
not allured by hope, or forced
by gratuities; and who beleeueth
otherwiſe, muſt not maruell
if many times there be occaſions
to complaine of ſeruants,
ſince without all doubt,
the Maſter is the rule and paterne
of the quality of the ſeruice
to thoſe that follow him:
whereupon the meaſure falling
out ſcarſe and couetouſly-ſhort
on his ſide, vniuſtly ſhould he
pretend a large abundance or
heaped vp liberality from his
ſeruants. But all theſe difficulties
are ſuppoſed not in poſſeſſion
of fauor, but in ſleight regard,
becauſe if any one bee
found intereſſed in his Princes

loue, he cannot fall into any of
the foreſaid conceits, but diſpoſeth
of his fauours as it pleaſeth
him, yet regularly and with that
modeſty and wiſdome, which is
required of him who is to deale
with a perſon of that quality as
we preſuppoſe the Prince to be.
               But heere wee muſt not leaue
to ſhew, that the Courtier may
alſo in many other things by an
other way without being ouer
comberſome vnto the Prince,
be a meanes for others of many
fauours; and this conſiſteth in
vſing the helpe of principall officers
and miniſters who are able
in their charge or may eaſily
finde the occaſion to obtaine
many fauours, or by themſelues
make many reſolutions, whereof
the prouident Courtier may
make ſome vſe, either for his
owne or his friends profit and

commoditie, for that theſe officers
whereof we ſpeake being
for the moſt part none of the
Princes family, or howſoeuer
if they were thereof, being deſirous
to haue any ſpeciall protection
from him, they will willingly
endeuour to deſerue the
good will of him whom they
know to bee moſt fauored and
moſt deere; and this courſe
of procuring fauour without
trouble vnto the Prince, is verie
commendable, being conuenient
to reſerue his fauor & helpe
for things of greater importance:
Beſides this going thus
retiredly and vſing the meanes
of others in their proper charges,
is not onely profitable, for
the aboue alleaged reaſons, but
are as teſtimonie of modeſtie &
reuerence towards his Prince:
As though one could neuer arrogate

ſo much in deſert by ſeruice,
that confidently he might
charge him with expectation of
fauours or rewards. But on the
other ſide, it is neceſſarie to flie
the other extreame; for that
thoſe who fearing to be faſtidious
or troubleſome vnto their
Prince, neuer deſire any fauour
of him, incurre two great errors;
the firſt is, they loſe the
occaſions to winne to themſelues
aſſured friends and dependents;
the other is, that by
theſe meanes they neuer get the
reputation which is incident to
thoſe Courtiers, who make
themſelues knowen to be
beloued and fauored
of the Prince
whom they
ſerue.

What muſt be obſerued not to haue
the Courtiers his enemies,
and to auoid ill turnes
and bad offices.
               ALthough many are by nature
ſo auſtere, that neither
by benefits or other merits it is
poſſible to make them tractable
or beneuolent, yet are not
all men of this diſpoſition or
quality; wherfore towards thoſe
which are of more ciuilitie and
humanity, the Courtier is to abſtain
and beware of two things,
that is, to offend them or giue
occaſion of enuie. Let vs firſt
ſpeak of the offences, as the moſt
efficient cauſe of hatred, and
then ſecondly of enuie.
               
               Howbeit therefore that many
are the meanes whereby the

Courtier may giue offence, yet
that of detraction and paſſing
bad offices with the Prince to
another mans detriment, ſeemes
to bee moſt proper vnto him
as a Courtier. This was a cunning
or arte much vſed by Seianus,
of whom Cornelius Tacitus
hauing ſaid,Ann. 4. lib. 4. that fuit audax, ſui
obtegens, he was bold & a concealor
of his owne deſſeignes:
he ioineth therewithall, in alios
criminator, a calumniator or
finde-fault of others. And Antonius
Primus purpoſed as
much, and in effect performed
no leſſe againſt Mutianus, who
notwithſtanding with the ſame
weapon, fortunately defended
himſelf, inſomuch that through
the great and manifold good
turnes which Antonius had deſerued
of Veſpaſian, hee eaſilie
blotted out the memory thereof.

And truely ſince it is ſo, that
no more then one at once, can
well poſſeſſe the chiefeſt place
in the Princes fauour, it is neceſſarie
ſo much as may bee, to
keepe others a loofe off, from
entring in, which chiefly is performed
by attenuating other
mens merits, and prouoking either
the Princes neglect or hatred
againſt thoſe in particular,
who for the neereneſſe they are
in the Princes fauour, are more
dangerouſly left in that degree,
without ſome moleſtation.
Howſoeuer, yet this ſeemeth
very abſurd, that any whoſe
ſcope is honorable reputation,
ſhould take ſo crooked and ſiniſtrous
a courſe, there being no
ſo apparent a ſigne of any mans
abiect baſeneſſe, nor any thing
that more diſtaineth ciuilitie it
ſelfe, then Vnde alijs infamiam

pariat, inde gloriam quemquam ſibi
recipere: whence others get
diſgrace, thence any man to
ground his glory or aduancement,
and that which more importeth,
ſeeming to conquer in
this campe, in ſtead of vertue &
commendable valor, he procureth
for his reward malice, hatred,
and enuie; beſides, it is very
probable, that a wiſe and generous
Prince ought not to receiue
into any degree of fauor, a
Courtier who ſhould be knowen
to be apt and prone by nature
and badde inclination to ſlander
or ſpeake euill to an others
preiudice, becauſe, Si proditores,
etiam ijs quos anteponunt inuiſt
ſunt; if once traytors, then are
they hatefull euen to thoſe who
make vſe of them; how much
more ſhould calumniators or
ſlanderers be odious! frō whom

the Prince (as ſuch kind of men)
receaueth no ſeruice at all, but
rather a cauſe of diſguſt or diſlike
towards thoſe, by whom
happely he might be better ſerued,
then by theſe detractors;
and giueth him occaſion alſo to
doubt, leſt they ſhould arme
themſelues in like terms againſt
himſelfe, with their malignant
toongs, in offence of his honor
and reputation. And certeinly
though it be fit the Prince ſhuld
omnia ſcire,
                  Tac. in vit. Cor. Agri. and that alſo in his
owne family; that he might the
better gouerne the ſame, there
is no doubt, but the informers
therof are not very gratefull vnto
him, and hatefull vnto all others
of the Court, either for
ſome offence receaued, or ſuſpecting
or fearing to receaue
ſome, as in all likelihood they
may iuſtly feare of perſons ſo

wickedly inclined. Wherefore
this courſe is not onely not honorable,
but very dangerous, &
expoſed to many hurts, which
grow many times to that pitch,
that alone they degrade not
the Courtier from the Princes
grace, but irrecouerablie cauſe
his vtter ruine, and that chiefly
becauſe if he begin but once to
falter, his owne friends conforming
themſelues to the reſt, become
his perſecutors, and then
with his owne ouerthrow, hee
ſhall know how true it is, that
nihil rerum mortalium tam inſtabile
ac fluxum est,
                  Tac. lib. 13. ann. 
                  quàm fama potentiae,
non ſua vi nixae; there is no
mortal thing ſo inſtable and fickle
as the ſame of greatneſſe not
ſupported by it owne force or
ſtrength; and that he ought to
haue imprinted in his memorie
that other ſaying, quanto quis

plus adeptus eſt, tante ſe magis in
lubrico exiſtimet; how much the
more a man hath heaped vp, in
ſo much the greater inſtabilitie
and icey-footing let him ſuppoſe
himſelfe. Theſe in my opinion
may well be called bad
offices: from the which the wiſe
and honorable Courtier for the
reaſons aboue alleaged, ought
wholly to abſteine.

himſelfe with his enemies
and perſecutors.
               BVt becauſe it is a naturall
thing to defend our ſelues
and to deuiſe how to preſerue
and mainetaine vs in that ſtate
of happineſſe which with great
labour wee haue procured, and
that oftentimes it may fall out

that one may be maligned, or at
leaſt may haue ſome other accidents
ſo neere at hand, that danger
ſhalbe imminent to him that
with ſome arte or skill doth not
defend himſelfe; it ſhall be fit to
diſcourſe how the Courtier is to
gouerne him, betweene theſe
two ſo dangerous rockes, the
one of ſlaunderous backebiting
and perſecution, the other of concurrency
and emulation.
               
               Firſt of perſecution, againſt
the which hee muſt firſt make
his defence with rewards and
benefits, the which are apt not
only to extinguiſh this malignity,
and to ſurceaſe that dangerous
proſecution, but to change
and conuert the imagination of
hurt and wrong, into a more
beneuolent and friendly mind.
This ſhall bee a moſt profitable
gaine, and ſo much the more

commendable, the leſſe it ſhalbe
vſed, ſauing to perſons in whom
vertue in his higheſt degree,
hath wonne the regiment of a
moſt perfect habit, it being naturally
very abſurd to bee beneficiall
to thoſe who are knowen
to be of a peruerſe and ill affected
minde: but becauſe many
times, ſuch is the malignitie of
men, that it cannot be appeaſed
or ouercome by any benefit, it
is neceſſary to take ſome other
courſe, that is, with a reſolute
mind to make proofe who ſhall
in the end preuaile, deuiſing
how to extinguiſh or ſupplant
his aduerſary, not by death, but
by expulſion, either out of
Court or wholly out of fauour.
And this will ſucceed very ſecurely,
and without any great
labour, to him who ſhall be in
ſuch fauour as we now preſuppoſe

him, becauſe he ſhall not
only haue eaſie acceſſe vnto the
Princes eare, whereby he may
haue diſcourſe at his pleaſure,
and take occaſion to do bad offices
againſt his perſecuters, but
he ſhall poſſeſſe a great faction
of friends amongſt the Courtiers,
who may ſerue his turne by
giuing out, and ſowing in the
Court, yea and with the Prince
himſelfe, the like ſeed of report,
whereby the traducers in the
end ſhall reape the fruits anſwerable
to their deſerts. But the
Courtier for his owne part muſt
endeuour to keepe himſelfe in
the good opinion of him againſt
whom hee mindes to reuenge
himſelfe, not giuing the leaſt
occaſion or ſigne of bad ſatisfaction,
and keepe himſelfe the
moſt wary and retired in his
ſpeech in all places and at all

times that may be. And in ſted
heereof he muſt haue his miniſters
ready, by whoſe meanes
he may compaſſe his deſſeigned
purpoſe; as moſt eaſily he ſhall
doe, if beſides this, vpon occaſions
with the Prince, either excuſing
or denying the accuſations
ſpread of his aduerſarie, he
ſhall ſo much the more confirm
them, by how much he ſhal ſhew
himſelfe the leſſe intereſſed or
malicious againſt him. But here
we muſt note, that if the perſecutions
on the other ſide be open
and manifeſt, and ſuch as
can not be concealed, and done
as it were in diſgrace; it is then
neceſſary, openly, and not by
cloſe conueiance, to reſiſt them,
for the manifeſtation and notice
that thereof may be taken,
both of his authoritie & power
to defend himſelfe and offend

others, when he is ſo reſolued:
whereby followeth both a feare
and hope in others, which affects
are the beginnings, though diuerſly,
of friendſhip and confidence,
becauſe feare enforceth
to confidence for the more aſſurance,
& hope induceth friendſhip
to win profit and commoditie
thereby: yet howſoeuer,
many had rather vſe diſſimulation
& cloſe ſtratagems againſt
their enemies, either for their
reputation in making ſlight regard
of wrongs, or the commendations
which they procure
in pardoning iniuries, or at leaſt
becauſe by this meanes they
make their enemie the leſſe
heedfull, wherby with the more
eaſe they ſuppreſſe him; & quo
incautior deciperetur,
                  Lib. 1. hist. 
                  palam laudatum,
ſaith Tacitus: and to the
end he might more vnwarily be

deceiued, praiſed him openly. I
know not to what purpoſe, but
for certeine, this was the onely
arte & ſleight of Tiberius, which
in particular he vſed againſt his
nephew Germanicus, and againſt
Seianus his fauorite, who liuing
in the fauor of Tiberius, did alſo
practiſe it to the ruine and ouerthrow
of many: and Mutianus
by the ſelfe ſame oppreſſed his
Concurrent Antonius Primus.
Theſe then are the two meanes
to reſiſt our enemies and perſecuters
in the Court. But if one
be but of little authoritie or fauour
with the Prince, and notwithſtanding
maligned in the
obteining thereof, there are two
remedies; the firſt is, to humble
himſelfe to the detractours,
ſeeking all the meanes to procure
them to be his friends, and
to make them beleeue hee pretendeth

not any thing more
than themſelues. The other is,
to be an adherent or dependent
to the moſt potent of the court,
vnder whoſe protection he may
liue; or at leaſt to be of the contrary
faction to them, if there
ſhall be any, as it is moſt vſuall
and common among the Courtiers.
To conclude, to ſhun or
take away the occaſion, by inſinuating
into their fauor, or by
liuing vnder the ſhelter of ſome
other, or els to reſiſt them by
the ſuccor and force of the contrary
faction.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXIIII.
How he may keepe backe his Concurrents
and Corriuals.
               BVt if the danger of being
remooued from poſſeſſion
of this fauour grow from anothers

well deſeruing, whereby
the Concurrents indeuor themſelues
to be aduanced and preferred
into the loue and grace
of the Prince, it ſhould bee
then neceſſary to take another
way.
               And truly, howbeit it falleth
out very ſeldome, that any Maſter
who hath bound and found
a ſeruant confident vnto him,
can greatly loue any other, ſince
one and the ſame kinde of loue
can hardly be branched and ſeuered
into diuers ſubiects: notwithſtanding
becauſe it may fal
out, & often times it hath been
ſeene come to paſſe, that Courtiers
who for a time were fauorites
and priuados, haue beene
expulſed and loſt their grace, it
is neceſſary in ſuch caſe to ſhew
the meanes how to preſerue the
ſame. The firſt precept therefore

is, that he endeuour by diligent
ſeruice to out ſtrip his
Concurrents in good deſerts,
this being the moſt reall & honourable
way, ſucceedeth alſo
more ſecurely, tending wholly
and ending in the profit and
commoditie of the Prince, from
whom, as we haue often ſayd,
proportionable fauour muſt be
attended, and expected according
to the actual ſeruice done.
But when this courſe is not
thought ſufficient, it is neceſſary
as much as is poſſible to thruſt
off, and keepe backe, ſuch Concurrents
from the Princes ſeruice:
vſing meanes that either
very ſeldome or neuer there be
occaſion giuen, for them to inſinuate,
either by ſeruice or familiarity
into the pleaſure of his
Lord or Prince: this will eaſily
fall out, if at the firſt he be vigilant

in not permitting any man
to thruſt himſelfe too forwards,
becauſe out of this time, the remedy
will bee both hard and
dangerous. But to the performance
heereof ſince one alone
cannot with effect ſupply all
charges and offices, it is neceſſary
to bring in others dependents
on him, and qualified in
ſuch ſort as before hath beene
declared, ſo that the Prince being
ſerued & ſatisfied by theſe,
haue no cauſe to long after, or
deſire the ſeruice of the others,
whoſe practice might happily
breed matter both of feare and
ielouſie. But this not ſucceeding,
I will not ſpeake of badde
offices: ſince theſe as inhumane
& not fitting any woorthy
or honorable man, and alſo as
not being very ſecure▪ ought to
bee baniſhed the very thoughts

of euery good and Chriſtian
Courtier.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXV.
The meanes how to auoid enuy.
               LEt vs now come to that other
part which is the cauſe
that Princes fauorites are ſeldome
ſeene or looked on with
a fauourable eie by the reſt of
the Courtiers: and that is, Enuy,
the which, who ſhall well conſider
things antiently paſt, ſhall
finde it to haue beene the cauſe
of the ruine of ſo many, that the
teſtimony of examples to ſo
manifeſt a knowledge were
meere ſuperfluous: and therefore
with diuers ſleights & arts
by the wiſeſt Courtiers, hath euer
beene auoided: the which
we thinke fit in this place onely
with breuity to point at.
               
                  
Firſt therefore with the Enuious
wee muſt hold the ſame
courſe and rule, as with our perſecutors,
in endeuouring to appeaſe
them and make them our
friends with benefits and rewards;
ſince ſo being made our
well willers, they will not greeue
at an other mans profit, as at
their owne damage, the good of
one friend being common to
all friends. Next, for that the
cauſe of Enuy is an others good
& profit in poſſeſſion, it ſhall be
wiſedome to conceale it, or at
leaſt to make as ſlender eſteeme
thereof in apparence as may be,
not ſhewing himſelfe arrogant
or proud therof by any meanes,
but rather, as not caring for it,
or deſirous to leaue it, or to
make it common to ſome other:
Seianus, great Maſter in the
Courtiers arte, conſidering how

preiudiciall vnto him the concourſe
of the people, and courting
of him, was reſolued with
himſelfe,Tac. lib. 
                        •

the enuy borne him, by abandoning
the idle ſalutations of
the multitude, and remoouing
vaine ſhadowes. Words of great
conſideration, but little obſerued,
vera potentia augere, to encreaſe
true power and authority;
and heerein conſiſteth the true
eſſentiall iudgement and worth
of the Courtier. True it is that
afterwards he conſidering, aſſiduos
in domum coetus arcendo, infringere
potentiam, that driuing
away or neglecting the continuall
concourſe of multitudes
that came vnto his houſe, hee
ſhould weaken his authority,
no leſſe then on the other ſide,

                  receptando, facultatem criminantibus
exhibere; enterteining them,
he ſhould miniſter matter vnto
enuious find-faults: laſtly, thus
ſtraightned in this difficult
counſell; Huc flexit, vt Tiberium
ad vitam procul Romam amonis
locis degendam impelleret;
he thus reſolued, that he would
perſwade Tiberius to lead his
life in ſome pleaſant places ſame
from Rome. And truly as this is
a moſt conſiderable point, ſo is
it exceeding hard to finde the
true ſquare or roote thereof, becauſe
that either not reſpecting
or refuſing ſome apparances, he
may greatly craſe his credit and
reputation, which indeed is no
other then opinion; and this opinion
groweth of the apparence
and ſhew, and not alone of being
a fauorite, but of the knowledge
that is taken thereof by

others: and on the other ſide,
from theſe oſtentations riſeth
enuie, whoſe follower manie
times is the ruine of the Courtier;
wherefore it is neceſſarie
to walke with infinite warineſſe
and diſcretion betweene theſe
two extreames: with this particular
aduertiſement, not to
grow too great or familiar with
the Courtiers,Lib. 2. hist. ſince that, Inſita
mortalibus natura, ſaith Tacitus,
it is naturall vnto euery man, recentem
aliorum foelicitatem aegris
oculis introſpicere, modúm

they haue knowen their equals.

ſupergrediretur: vpbraided
him with ſundry calumniations,
as that hee continually heaped
vp wealth in exceſſe, & beyond
the compaſſe of a priuate man,
that he wonne the hearts of the
people, and that for pleaſant
gardens and magnificent ſtately
buildings, hee almoſt exceeded
the Prince; colours, onely
for ſhadow and couerture of enuie:
purpoſed to make a reſignation
of all his fortunes and
wealth, or the greater part vnto

                  Nero againe; but this imagination
hauing no ſucceſſe, Inſtituta
prioris potentiae commutat,
prohibet coetus ſalutantium, vitat

changed the courſe of his firſt
greatneſſe, forbidding the multitudes
which came to perform
complements of curteſie, diſcharged
his followers, ſhewed
himſelfe ſeldome in the citie,
as though he kept home, either
fearing his health, or buſie at
his booke and ſtudies.
               Beſides all this, it ſerueth
much to the purpoſe to make a
ſhew that this fauour and grace
is rather voluntarily graunted
than ambitiouſly procured, vſing
the ſame, as hath bene ſaid,
not onely without offence to others,
but rather to the benefit

of others, and keeping the decorum
of his degree and place, not
with a proud diſdainefulneſſe,
but with a ſweet and graue modeſty,
ſome thing inclining to
popularity. Finally, becauſe
Enuy ſwaieth amongſt equals,
or perſons at leaſt that ſo thinke
themſelues, if any man ſhall endeuour
himſelfe ſo much to exceed
in vertue, or otherwiſe by
long and honourable ſeruice,
ſhould take occaſion to pretend
equality; without all queſtion
enuy would either ceaſe, or rather,
to ſpeake better, would neuer
begin.
               But when theſe obſeruations
ſhall not free or ſufficiently defend
the Courtier from this
contagion, whoſe companion
for the moſt part is malitious detraction,
if ſhee once ſhew her
ſelfe ſo apparently that offences

doe grow, we muſt then vſe the
ſame arte againſt the Enuious, as
againſt the maleuolent and wicked
ſlanderer; deuiſing; if it be
poſſible, to remooue him from
the Court, or wholly out of ſeruice;
and to performe the ſame
with the more eaſe, he ſhall doe
well to remember that which a
little before hath beene ſaid,
that is, howbeit the Courtier be
not by himſelfe to performe any
badde offices, hee may
paſſe them notwithſtanding by
meanes of his adherents, in caſe
neceſſity binde him to maintaine
his place; and therefore,
not onely for this purpoſe, but
for many other cauſes, it is neceſſary
that he be well furniſhed
of good ſtore of friends & confidents
of all ſorts, that is, to the
end to be enformed of all that is
done or ſaid in the Court, and

that for diuers reaſons. As firſt
to vnderſtand what opinion is
held of him amongſt the other
Courtiers, and which of his actions
are either praiſed or reprooued,
making vſe of ſuch aduice
by the way of correction. Next
to diſtinguiſh of faithfull from
fained friends, becauſe euerie
man ſhewes himſelfe louing and
kinde to him whom they know
fauoured of the Prince, though
it may be, really & indeed, they
are the contrary; a thing by
meanes of theſe confidents eaſily
diſcouered: ſince they are
conuerſant, he vnderſtand and
obſerue all that paſſeth in the
Court, chiefly entertaining ſome
who ſhall carry ſmall apparence
of being inward with him; for
that vnto ſuch, as not eſteemed
of any great credit, or partialiſts
to the fauoured Courtier, they

will eaſily vnmaske, and reueale
the very inwards of their harts:
or elſe themſelues being dextrous
& cunning in this kind as
men of good vnderſtāding, can
by an inckling eaſily coniecture
the reſt. And laſtly, to know
what is done, yea or thought
by theſe malitious enuiers euen
in their priuate liuing, becauſe
none liueth without ſinne, it
will be eaſie to finde matter to
reproue their bolde malitious
ſlanders with the knowledge of
their owne actions; and being
willing to hurt them that ſhall
goe about to offend or wrong
him, hee may eaſilie by
theſe meanes effect
and bring it to
paſſe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXXVI.
What the Courtier is to doe who
ſhall finde himſelfe ſlenderly
reſpected of his Prince
or Lord.
               THus much, in my opinion,
may be ſaid for the Courtiers
good aduertiſement: if any
other imagin he can more aptly
and with better method, and
in concluſion with more commendations
handle this arte, he
ſhould do great wrong to ciuill
ſocietie, and to the duty which
euery man oweth, (to labour
what in him is for the common
benefit) to defraud the world
from participating of his ſo
good thoughts and abilities. In
the meane time, if any man
happely guided by the rules &
precepts here ſet downe, lanching
foorth into the dangerous

maine & current of the Court,
ſhall rather ſuffer ſhipwracke,
than ſafely furdle vp his ſailes
in the deſired hauen. Me thinks
without ſiniſtrouſly iudging of
this doctrine learned by him, he
ſhould call to mind, that among
arts, there are ſome which are
called Coniecturall; and the reaſon
is, becauſe albeit their teaching
or inſtructing part propoſeth
a certeine knowen end or
ſcope, from the which there may
demonſtratiuely bee deduced
certeine concluſions, the which
wil make the context of the doctrine
both apparent and neceſſary,
ſo farre forth as the nature
of things to be acted will giue
leaue or ſuffer; wherein the wiſeſt
are of opinion, that it is not
poſſible to frame perfect demonſtrations.
Notwithſtanding,
the actiue part doth neuer

of neceſſitie performe the purpoſed
end, although it perform
all the actions ſo much as can
be deſired, proportionall and
correſpondent to the ſame. For
ſo we ſee an excellent & famous
Captain, who in euery part hath
performed the dutie of his proper
charge, yet his hope of victorie
may faile him, and not
ſort as hee deſired. So likewiſe
without errour of arte, the moſt
expert Mariner many times loſeth
himſelfe and the ſhip hee
ſailes in. Nor leſſe vnluckie
ſome times the Phyſitian miniſtreth
his drugges to the ſicke
patient without hope of helpe.
Nor many times can the apteſt
and moſt artificiall Rhetoritian
remoue a ſetled minde from a
purpoſed reſolution. To leaue
to ſpeake of many ſuch like arts,
the which not by neceſſitie, but

contingently, and as it were by
fortune or chance, obteine their
deſired ends, the Courtiers arte
being amongſt them, the precepts
thereof may worke no
leſſe erroneouſly than thoſe of
other arts called Coniecturall.
Wherefore, if after the obſeruance
of the aboue noted aduertiſements,
that fauor or grace
ſhall not bee obteined, or that
which is much worſe, if by any
accident it ſhuld be loſt ſo that
aſſuredly there were diſcouered
ſmall ſatisfaction in the Prince;
it reſteth, that for the ful accompliſhment
& perfecting of this
worke, we ſhould ſet downe in
this caſe what wee thinke conſiderable
and neceſſarie therein
for the Courtiers benefit.
               And queſtionleſſe there cannot
be a greater torment to the
hart of him that ſerueth, then to

ſee himſelfe ſlightly regarded or
beloued of his Lord, and this
accident particularly worketh
greateſt effects in thoſe who
haue not their mindes armed
with naturall magnanimity, or
vertuous education, but are rather
of a diſdainefull ſpirit, not
able to endure the conforming
of their affections, to the preſcript
rule or ſquare of an other
mans opinion, will or direction,
eſpecially in the maner of his liuing
either in peaceable quietneſſe,
or vnquiet buſineſſe:
whereupon it followeth many
times, the reſolutions of ſuch
men in theſe caſes are verie
ſtrange and vnconſiderate.
               Wherefore in this ſo doubtfull
a paſſage to conduct him
foorth by the guidance of wiſe
and fruitfull counſell, we firſt
ſay, that as in bodily ſickneſſes,

the cauſe knowen, remedies for
the cure therof are eaſily applied:
ſo muſt the Courtier, ſo
much as in him is, diligently
ſeeke out the occaſion that moueth
his Prince or Lord to bee
angry or not well diſpoſed towards
him, to the end either by
himſelfe, or by meanes of ſome
other to moue him therein: yet
ſo, that it fall not within the preiudice
of his principal deſignes,
as before hath beene handled,
becauſe then it ſhould be better
to leaue the ſeruice, by crauing
licence to depart. But becauſe
it is a ſaying. Che piaga, per allentar
d'arco non ſana; That the vnbending
of the bow is no healing
of the wound: ſo is it not
enough many times to remoue
the cauſe of this diſpleaſure, for
the minde notwithſtanding remaines
ſtill exulcerate and greeued.

It is neceſſary therefore
not onely to remooue the cauſe
of this anger, but to proceed in
the obſeruance of thoſe aduertiſements
which the Rhetoritians
teach for the lenefying and
appeaſing of minds once mooued,
as humiliation, acknowledging
of the errour, accuſing himſelfe,
crauing pardon, offring himſelfe
readie to all ſatisfaction: and
continuing with all patience in
theſe courſes, hee may make it
apparent how much he valueth
the fauor & loue of his Prince,
with the ſorrow hee ſuſtaineth
for his diſpleaſure: for this anger
growing of an offence,
which conteineth a neglect by
theſe foreſaid demonſtrations,
ſuch a counterpoiſe may bee
made in opinion to be thought
deſpiſed and diſgraced, that in
the end it may bring the Prince

to put on a more gentle and
pacified minde towards the
Courtier: ſo that this offence
and cauſe of badde ſatisfaction,
haue not taken ſuch roote, that
it prooue rather a hatred then a
diſlike; becauſe that in ſuch
caſe as to a more greeuous maladie,
a more potent medicine is
neceſſarie; the which manie
times the Courtier by no means
of obſequious diligence ſhal be
able to finde; whereupon hee
muſt haue recourſe to the helpe
of interceſſion and mediation
by ſome others, as the Princes
kindred, his friends, and other
Courtiers in greateſt fauour.
               But if none of theſe courſes
can ſtay the wrath nor appeaſe
the ſame, ſo that the hope of recouerie
of fauour be wholly extinct,
the End and Scope of his
ſeruice being taken away: it neceſſarily

followeth, that the ſocietie
alſo betweene the Prince
and the Courtier ſhould be diſſolued
by his abandoning and
leauing of the ſeruice. This reſolution
muſt bee taken but vpon
vrgent neceſſitie, for that
otherwiſe it would come ſeldome
to paſſe, but that the
Courtier ſhould incur great detriment,
either by opinion of
ſome ſpeciall want in him, and
chiefly in thoſe that haue liued
in greateſt fauour; or of ſome
raſh preſumption, as ſuppoſing
nothing can coequall his deſerts;
or of an inconſtancie of
nature which will neuer continue
long in one courſe; or finally,
by the loſſe of a Princes
protection, beſides his time, &
it may be, the flower of his age
vainely ſpent, and to ſmall purpoſe;
things all of them of ſpeciall

regard and eſtimation. But
when the caſe is deſperate, it
ſhall bee better to beſtow the
remnant of his life, in ſome other
ſeruice or imploiment, then
vnfruitfully to ſerue, where he
may ſooner expect a ſudden
diſcharge, than hope to compaſſe
any of thoſe Ends, which
whoſoeuer ſerueth in Court
doth aime at and
propound.
