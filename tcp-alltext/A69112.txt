                  PAïdeutico —Grammatice, or the right way to inſtruct Youth in Grammer: that is, the Hebrue, Greeke, Latine, or any other, is by Analyſis and Geneſis. Analyſis is a reſolving or undoing of the matter of Grammer, wiſely fitted to the underſtanding and capacity of the learners. Here we are ſpecially to take heed, that nothing bee paſſed over, either not ſufficiently made plaine by the Teacher, or not well underſtood by the Learner: then which evill, nothing is more pernicious in a Schoole. And Analyſis, is either of the precepts of the art it ſelfe, or the examples.
            The Analyſis of the precepts is, of the definitions, diviſions, proprieties, and tranſitions, from which onely all the knowledge of the Art is perfected. But there is a particular and peculiar expoſition of every precept,

whence the right underſtanding thereof is gotten. And it is Etymologicall or Syntacticall. Etymologicall is the explaining of the whole matter of Etymology, in Letters, Syllables, and ſingle-words. Where together with the Adſignifications of words, their ſignifications alſo, both proper and borrowed, offer themſelues neceſſary to bee explained. Hither likewiſe belong the Idiomes and proprieties of tongues, the obſervation whereof cannot without great loſſe of learning bee paſſed over. Syntacticall is a manifeſt explaining of the matter belonging to Syntax, in ſentences, and the parts thereof. Here the expreſſe ſignification of words, the elegancies of phraſes, the propriety of ſpeech, the apt placing of words, the naturall habit of the language, and the whole diſpoſing and framing of all things is to be obſerued. Thus much of the Analyſis of Precepts.
            The Analyſis of examples follows, which are indeed moſt aptly framed after the exact rule of the precepts. But the Analyſis of the example, is a skilfull applying of the example to the precept. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that the very precepts do more clearely appeare in the underſtandings of the learners,

and are more ſurely kept in their memory. And this is briefer, or longer. The briefer is that which explaines thoſe examples, which immediately are applyed to make cleare and demonſtrate the precepts of Art.
            The reſolving of theſe is ſo farre to bee made, as maketh for the underſtanding of that precept, whereof it is an example. But the longer is that which explaines the longer examples and treatiſes of Oratours, Hiſtorians, Poëts, and others whatſoeuer. The uſe and daily practiſe of this, maketh ready and perfect Grammarians, and that in a ſhort time: eſpecially if the Maiſter, wiſely and after good deliberation reſolving upon: firſt a certainty of Authors, exerciſes, and progreſſe for every ſeverall forme: ſecondly, one ſet taske, or exerciſe for every ſeverall houre, which in no wiſe ſhall exceede the compaſſe thereof: thirdly, that one houres Lecture requireth the practiſe of ſixe houres at the leaſt, for the applying of the ſame unto all manner of uſe, for writing and ſpeaking: fourthly, a conſtancy for uſing and obſerving the ſame from weeke to weeke, from month to month, and ſo forth: If the Maiſter, I ſay, hath out of the artificiall meaſure and number, and the elegantly-compoſed

order of ſuch claſſicall Authors, whereof there is in the whole life of man, good and continuall uſe, conſtrued: that is, verbally tranſlated, and with good iudgement fitted, every word and phraſe thereof to the Learners capacity, out of Latine into Engliſh alone, and out of Hebrue or Greeke into Engliſh or Latine alone: for there is one reaſon of all. Firſt, by ſetting each thing in his Grammaticall and naturall order: that is, all ſuch words as doe governe and are declared by others, in the former places, & ſuch as be governed, or doe declare, neceſſarily depending on the former, in the places next following: and withall ſufficiently inſtructing and informing his Scholars in the reaſons of this his placing of them according to Grammer. Secondly, by giving them their proper and naturall ſignifications, ſo farre forth as ſenſe, and the propriety of the Engliſh phraſe will in any wiſe permit: If otherwiſe, by reaſon of ſome trope, vnuſuall phraſe, or harder ſentence, let him ſet v. in the margent, Whatſoeuer is ſo expreſt in the Text, is not to bee conſtrued with the reſt of the Text. or in a different letter in the Text, to ſhew, that adverbum, it is otherwiſe: i. for id est, to explaine the ſence, and ſo forth. Which being uſed by the Scholars accordingly, hath the effects and benefites following.
            
               
               Benefits of verball Tranſlations to the Scholars.
               FIrſt, they may by their often reading their new Lecture, thus verbally by their Maiſter tranſlated into Engliſh alone, eaſily conceiue, truly underſtand, and well remember the generall drift and ſcope of their Authour for their preſent Lecture: and can, after they haue bene a little practiſed therein, and accuſtomed to it, make conuenient report thereof, before they come to conſtrue it. Which thing if they endevour to doe with proper words, fit ſentences, good grace and conſtantly, is a matter of great worth and ſtrange conſequence. Further, the underſtanding and knowing of the matter being the beginning and fountaine of writing elegantly, ſpeaking readily, and to the point, the reſt: whether words or phraſes with their ſignifications or uſes of them, will far more eaſily follow, and be much the ſooner learned. And this is the ready entrance to the Analyſis by verball tranſlations.
               Secondly, boyes alone, or a forme by it ſelfe, the argument and matter being firſt well knowne, can by uſing verball tranſlations, take new Lectures, conſtruing firſt

out of the Engliſh into Latine, and backe againe out of the Latine into Engliſh. Which indeed, beeing truely conſidered, is nothing elſe but a cōtinuall making of Latine, as out of the Maiſters Dictates, or an anſwering in Latine, to one that in leading them by the hand, goeth from point to point, before them in Engliſh. In which taking of lectures by themſelues, as, firſt they are rightly directed, and certainly guided, to giue every word his true force, every phraſe his right ſence, and every thing his owne place: So ſecondly, for the preventing of diſcontentment to their Maiſter by forgetfulneſſe, and the better imprinting of all things in their minds, they may, without ever failing, bee more conſtantly inſtructed, then by the liuely voyce of the Maiſter alone, which may bee hindered by forgetfulneſſe, ſome employment, interruption, wearineſſe, abſence, ſickneſſe, age, and ſo forth: And which notwithſtanding: he may, if the obſcure and hidden ſence of the Authour require, uſe at his pleaſure, whereas on the other ſide, verball tranſlations, ſubject to none of theſe, are continually ready, and at hand, preventing all loſſe of time and labour.
               Thirdly, if the Scholars doe ſo well underſtand,

and truely know the paradeigmata of Nounes and Verbes, and the moſt uſuall examples of Syntax, that they be able to parallell, that is, to ſhew what caſe of Noune perſon of Verbe, or example of Syntax, every word in their Lecture is like (for till that time no man of judgement in this kind, will thinke the Scholars fit to go any further,) and alſo finding the words in their Grammaticall & naturall order as they were conſtrued, may now eaſily, for to gaine time, alone, and by themſelues parſe and examine their Lecture without further helpe, or aſking, or being asked any queſtion, and that without errour, rendring a reaſon why every word is ſo as it is, and not otherwiſe: that is to ſay, why a word is the ſingular number, and not the plurall, and the contrary: why the Nominatiue caſe, and not the Genitiue: why the Preſent tenſe, and not the Future, or any elſe: and ſo for any other like circūſtance of Etymology or Syntax. All this the Scholars may do, as out of their Lecture, as it lies in their Author, or elſe as it is dayly (for that end) written in their paper booke in the Grammaticall & naturall order in Latine alone: ſo alſo much better, and far more profitably out of the verball tranſlations

in Engliſh-alone.
               Fourthly, verball tranſlations are a very notable meanes, as in men, for the recovering of knowledge decayed, and the encreaſe and growth thereof in ſuch as are but entred into the tongue: ſo alſo in children for the keeping in minde of things before learned: for by helpe hereof, they may by a daily and continuall repeating every one his ſection or part, out of Engliſh into Latine, and backe againe out of Latine into Engliſh, in a ſhort time go over, and ſo eaſily keepe long treatiſes, that were once well knowne, perfectly underſtood, and the repetition thereof not long intermitted. The ſame alſo may bee ſaid for the keeping of Dictates that haue beene carefully corrected by their Maiſter, whether in the forme of Colloquies, Epiſtles, Theames, and ſo forth. And in caſe they doe againe and againe forget, (as children often doe) they may hereby eaſily refreſh their memory at their pleaſure. Doubtleſſe hereby they ſhall attaine to ſo perfect, and abſolute a knowledge in all things learned, and circumſtances thereof, that for the ſame, and the like of that nature and kinde, they will be ſo prompt and ready, that they ſhall never afterward neede, for the words and

phraſes Lexicon or Dictionary▪ or for the matter, inſtructer, or teacher: becauſe all things thus learned, iterated, exerciſed, yea imprinted and engraven in them, will ſticke ſo faſt in their memory, that they will bee able, as out of a rich ſtore-houſe (fully fraught with wares of great worth and price) perpetually to bring forth their owne ſtuffe, old and new, choyce and good, and that more ſurely for all uſes of writing and ſpeaking ſodainly or otherwiſe, then by the ordinary means of learning the moſt Authours without booke. Which practiſe notwithſtanding for the increaſe and maintaining of memory, that without daily exerciſe decayeth, is very neceſſary. And then onely without tediouſneſſe, may Lectures and Treatiſes bee committed to memory, when they haue beene by often reading, conſtruing, parſing, making manifold uſe & great practiſe thereof, throughly knowne, and perfectly underſtood. Therfore all ſuch precious & unrecouerable time as hath been ill, or to no great purpoſe uſually ſpent, Centies agendo centies actum, an hundred times going over that that had beene already an hundred times done, may by the wiſe Maiſter bee wholly gained, and kept as an unknowne treaſure, to be better

and more wiſely imployed in all the practiſes of memory for the retaining of all things before learned.
               Fifthly, verball tranſlations help very much to attaine a variety and copy of words and phraſes, and in time to a laudable propriety, and purity of writing and ſpeaking the Engliſh tongue, the very maine end, why more then nine ten parts of children bee ſet to Schoole. Which ſeeing it is our naturall tongue, and in any courſe of life afterward altogether in uſe, ought much more then it is, to bee Grammatically knowne, and after the courſe here ſet downe for the Latine, parſed and examined, and in all Schoole exerciſes (after Tullies example, who as well in matters of Oratory, as Philoſophy, Cum Graecis Latina coniunxit) daily practiſed: yea the Idiomes, proprieties, and elegancies, peculiar to this tongue, are as much, and as conſtantly by the Maiſter to be ſhewed, taught, inculcated, exerciſed and learned, as the Latiniſmes, Greciſmes, Hebraiſmes, and ſo forth. Thus much of the benefites to the Scholars.
            
            
               
               Benefits of Ʋerball Tranſlations to the Maiſter.
               FIrſt, he having once adviſedly writtē the verball Tranſlations in Engliſh alone, is for ever afterward freed from iterating the ſame, neither ſhall hee need, or any for him, any more to interpret and conſtrue thoſe Authors ſo verbally tranſlated.
               Secondly, what occaſions ſoever do befall him of abſence, or other lets and interruptions, his Scholars enured to the manner of verball Tranſlations, haue a ſure and never-failing guide for their daily and ſufficient proceeding.
               Thirdly, he ſhall not need to be troubled with telling, and many times telling what is forgotten, or doubted of, or ſo much vexed with his ſcholars dulneſſe and untowardneſſe, as before, ſeeing they by theſe verbal Tranſlations can of themſelues learne their Lectures, and forgetting any thing therein, may herewith alſo refreſh their memoryes, and by taking paines, make themſelues prompt and ready in all circumſtances thereof.
               Fourthly, the Maiſter being hereby freed

from that▪ that is the leaſt part of his Office, the toyle of exact reading of Lectures to his Scholars, aſſured alſo that in his very abſence, they doe hereby make ſufficient progreſſe, may in his daily taking account and examining every Lecture, by hearing, exhorting, correcting, and every way exerciſing them, and by all his words, deeds, examples, wiſely ordering, & diſcreetly guiding them, which be the chiefeſt points of his function: (for men are made exquiſitely skilfull in Tongues, and Arts by example, imitation, diligence and cuſtome, much better then by precepts) he, I ſay, may beſtow the greater paines: firſt, upon all ſuch words and phraſes as be ſpecially to be obſerved and noted, for extraordinary uſe, excellency, or unuſuall difficulty, as being ſome ſtrange Anomaly in Latine, or ſome phraſe much differing from the vulgar tongue, Secondly, with a purpoſe to leaue nothing therein (that concerns thē any way to know) unſearched out, familiarly, plainly, and from point to point (as the proverbe ſaith) going before them, in propounding queſtions of the matter of their Lecture, that even therein alſo, for the increaſe and growth of their judgement, they may be familiarly acquainted, &

ſurely grounded, uſing the very words and phraſes thereof in Engliſh and Latine together, and the Scholar anſwere likewiſe; then in Latine alone. Which exerciſe if hee once a day conſtantly practiſe, in teaching them as well the words, phraſes, ſentences, and ſo forth, as the matter of any new Lecture, or ſhort ſentence unlearned, or unheard of before, without the helpe of any booke, or ſo much as once telling them any thing, except when he can by no circumſtance bolt it out, or finde it in them, for making both the tongue and the matter their owne, is a notable inſtrument, for remembrance leaveth a moſt deepe impreſſion, and for any conſequence of Schoole-learning hath very admirable effects.
               Fifthly, his great labour of moving, iterating, and many times iterating queſtions in parſing, may be, by this meanes alſo after ſome reaſonable practiſe, if not utterly removed, yet much eaſed: for even young Scholars, may by, and among themſelues, with ſome reaſonable over-looking and directing, performe it to very good purpoſe. Thus much of the fourth and laſt Grammaticall Analyſis.
               
               
                  Geneſis is the making of a Grammer exerciſe

handſomely and wormanlike faſhioned to the rule of the precepts. And it is either an imitation of ſome approved author, or the invention of the maker. An imitation is a Geneſis, made after the examples of the beſt Authors, as of Cicero, Ceſar, Livy, Ʋirgill, Ovid, Horace, Terence, and ſo forth. Here foure obſervations are moſt neceſſary: Firſt, that the Maiſter dictate and go before his Scholars in every Geneſis, vntill they bee competently able to make them alone and by themſelues, alwais over every unknowne word or phraſe in Engliſh, writing the proper word or phraſe in Latine. The ſecond, that every Geneſis be made in the very ſteps of the Grammaticall Analyſis. The third, that as in every new Geneſis there bee a continuall practiſing of ſome words formerly learned, ſo alſo that they make greateſt practiſe, and moſt vſes of the obſcureſt things, and ſpend their chiefeſt pains upon thoſe elegant phraſes and ſentences,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   which differ moſt from 
                     〈…〉
                  . The fourth, that the 
                     〈…〉
                   by tongue and 
                     〈…〉
                   any 
                     〈…〉
                  , ſentence, the matter 
                     〈…〉
                  , Epiſtle, and ſo forth.

The firſt imitation is of the word governing, and the word governed alone, with any leaſt alteration of number caſe, gender, tenſe, or perſon. The ſecond imitation is of them which we commonly call Phraſes & f
                        •
                     rmulae loquenai: and alſo of a whole ſentence of two, or moe clauſes, by changing therein one, two, or moe words. The third imit
                     •
                  tion, when the two former haue been▪ by continuall and long practiſe the very 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and never deceiving guide to all good learning, made eaſie and familiar: is 
                     〈◊〉
                   about the help of their author 
                     〈…〉
                  , wherein their Lectures be written, in the Grammaticall and naturall order in Latine alone, or elſe out of their verball tranſlations in Engliſh, againe to frame 
                     •
                  n meaſure and number the Latine, as every word had beene before artificially compoſed, and cunningly placed in their Authour▪ yea and to make every word and phraſe in their Dictates ſutable, and every way anſwerable to the ſame elegant compoſed ſtile. Which Geneſis if it be from verball tranſlations of Poëts, (and that they vnderſtand the quantities of ſyllables, with the reaſon of feet and verſes) maketh the entrance into verſifying moſt ready and pleaſant: and with manifold

uſe of Parodiae and imitation of verſes, it alſo maketh the veine and phraſes of Poets eaſie and familiar. In theſe ſeverall ſorts of Geneſis, even the young Scholar may bee bold and confident, that his Latine is right, good and pure, the order of words, elegant, neat, and ſweet: Laſtly, his verſe true, plaine and eaſie, having his author to avouch and warrant the ſame, as the examining and trying of all wil ſhew plainly, and proue directly. The fourth and laſt imitation when they be as familiarly acquainted with, and as wel able to practiſe this third, as the two former, is to goe forward with ſome well and cunningly compoſed Geneſis, whether in a Colloquy, Epiſtle, or other uſuall Schoole-exerciſe, wherein is required more diſcretion and choyce, then in the former. This is chiefly made by changing the purpoſe of the Author, and his courſe of ſpeech: ſo that it may ſeeme to be their owne invention, rather then the imitation of another. It is either addition, which therunto applieth ſome thing diviſed by themſelues, or borrowed elſewhere: or elſe detraction, whereby thoſe things are cut away which moſt bewray their imitation, or ſerue not ſo fitly to their preſent purpoſe. Which thing is here eſpecially

to be remembred, leſt they ſhould ſeeme to haue learned the art of ſtealing, rather then the skill of writing and ſpeaking. I will not here meddle with (ſeeing it requireth more both maturity of wit, & ſoundneſſe of judgement, then is uſually to bee found in Grammer Scholars) that laſt Geneſis, which very notably painting out the Summum bonum of the Art it ſelfe, as beeing indeed the very marke whereat we aime, and the true perfection of all profeſſions in learning, is the deviſers meere invention. Then which nothing in the common courſe of mans life is more commendable, nothing to Church and Common-wealth more profitable. Geneſis hath beene thus far.
               By theſe and the like meanes the Maiſter that is carefull to do good by all means poſſible in his place, and willing to uphold his authority, by joyning wiſe and graue ſeverity with kind and loving feare, will bend all his endevors, to make the ſchoole by all good policy an houſe of play and pleaſure. And becauſe Fax mentis honeſtae gloria, praiſe is a great inflamer of an honeſt diſpoſition, and the beſt whetſtone to ſet an edge upon a dull wit, he will ſtriue: firſt, by all the means of cheerefulneſſe, in countenance, words,

geſtures, and deeds to put life and ſpirit into the very wit of his Scholars, for their better conceiving: into their memory, for retaining: into their will, for labouring: into their diſpoſition, for the attaining of piety, vertue, knowledge, and all goodneſſe.
               Secondly, by ſowing amongſt them matter of all honeſt contention, and laudable emulation, and provoking them every way, day by day, to excell one another by talking together, as in Corderius: by diſputing one againſt another, as in Stock-wood: by writing one to another, as imitating one and the ſame Epiſtle of Tully: by repreſenting the perſons of others, in pronouncing and acting ſome Scene in Terence: by giving the ſumme or argument of a Treatiſe, Epiſtle, Oration, Poëme, Story, and ſo forth: by reporting ſome fable of Aeſope: by writing the Romane and Secretary hands: by ſtriving who can finde moſt errours in each others exerciſes, and the like. O then how eagerly will they ſtriue, who ſhall performe the matter propounded and preſcribed, with greateſt commendations, profite moſt, and proue beſt learned. The pregnant and quicker ſort will ſtriue to ſupply the firſt rankes; and the dull and heavy diſpoſition, at leaſt deſiring, if no

way to be equall with, to ſecond, or come neere the beſt, yet certainly to point & aime at the worthieſt. Of ſo great worth is a wiſe and diſcreete Maiſter, that of all them that come under his tuition, and charge, the naturall foole onely is finally found uncapable of his diſcipline. All the Maiſter his endevours ſhall bee the more effectuall, if parents and friends at home (wiſely preventing all odious telling tales out of the Schoole) would by propounding to their children if they profite in learning, and deſerue wel, rewards: but if if all, puniſhment: conſtantly and with good deſcretion, exact at their hands a reaſon, and an account of their daily & whole employment in the Schoole. For diſcipline at Schoole alone moveth ſomewhat: but at home and Schoole too, promoteth learning greatly. This would, in ſtead of cauſing boyes by any bitter diſcouragement of words, or otherwiſe, to diſtaſte and abhorre the Schoole, before they know, or can be acquainted with the ſweetneſſe of knowledge: make them to be greatly enflamed with the deſire and loue of learning, which as it is of it ſelfe ſweet and pleaſant: ſo it is naturally inbred in all men, though by perverſe proceeding, diſorderly courſes, and uneaſie

meanes of teaching it bee made unpleaſant, tedious, and ſo, for the moſt part, be neglected, yea rejected and contemned, as a thing utterly fruitleſſe and un-neceſſary.
               All things then being well conſidered, children may by theſe courſes, upon ſurer ground, with better courage, more eaſe, greter pleaſure, much more conſtantly, & in far ſhorter time, then uſually heretofore, attaine unto more ſound ſchoole-learning, keepe it more faithfully in memory, and make more true uſe of it, to the great content of their parents, & friends, their owne benefites in the whole courſe of their life, the advancemēt of learning & all good Arts, the ſingular good of Church & Commonwealth, & their Maiſters great joy, and much encouragement, when he may in the ſingleneſſe of his heart, a good conſcience, and unſpeakeable comfort cheerefully goe on in this his calling, though painfull, and little eſteemed, yet moſt neceſſary, and profitable, knowing aſſuredly, that with the Lord whom he ſerveth, his reward is laid vp in heaven.

               v  I uſe very f. 
            
               Aſcalpo of Patras,

            unto me,
            as alſo
            his Art,
            whereof
            I haue had experiēce,
            
               in the ſickneſſe, i. in val. vel recuperanda, vel confirmanda.
            
            of my friends.
            Wherein
            he hath ſatiſfied
            me
            both
            for his very knowledge
            as alſo
            for his faithfulneſſe
            and good will.
            I recommend then
            this man
            unto you:
            and
            craue
            of you
            that
            you would doe what you can
            that
            hee may underſtand
            that I haue written
            carefully
            concerning him,
            and that my commendation
            hath ſtood him in great ſtead.
            
               v.  hath been to g. uſe to him 
            That
            ſhall be
            excéedingly well pleaſing
            unto me.

            that
            they long after your ſafety more
            then I.
            
               v  they would rather

            Which thing indéed
            I neither haue left off
            to doe,
            neither
            will I leaue off,
            yea already
            haue I done it
            in ye greateſt matter,
            and
            haue laid
            the platforme

            Cicero S.D. Mario. 23 7 4
            
            I came
            with your Libo
            
            or ours rather:
            to Cuman farme
            about the eighth of the Kalends
            
               v.  about the foure or

               ſ.  ire. 
            out of hand
            to Pompejan:
            
            but
            I will ſend you word
            before.
            As
            I deſire
            that you may haue your health
            alwayes,
            ſo eſpecially
            while
            we are
            here:
            for you ſee
            how long
            afterward
            we are to be
            together.
            Wherefore
            if
            you haue determined any thing
            with the goute,
            ſée
            you put it off
            vnto another day.
            Haue a care then
            of your health,
            
               v.  that you be in h. 
            and
            looke for

            within theſe two or three dayes.
            Fare you well.
         
         
            Cicero S.D. Planco imp. coſ. deſ. 24 10 14
            
            O welcome report
            two dayes
            before the victory,
            of your helpe,
            of your care,
            of your ſpeedineſſe,
            of your army;
            But the enemies being diſperſed,
            all the hope
            is
            in you.
            For the beſt knowne ring-leaders
            
               of the robbers
            are reported
            to be fled
            out of Moden battell.
            
               v.  of Mutine b. 
            And it is
            no leſſe thankworthy
            to diſpatch
            the laſt,
            then
            to chaſe away
            the firſt.
            I ſurely
            before this
            did expect
            your letter,
            together with many other:
            and did alſo hope,
            that Lepidus
            
            admoniſhed
            by the times
            with you
            would alſo giue cō
               tent unto
            the common-wealth.
            
               id eſt, would thinke as you doe, and ſatiſfie the c. w. verbatim, to be about to doe with you, and ſufficiently for the common-wealth.
               
            
            Therefore
            my good Plancus
            
            bend all your force
            to that charge,
            
               id eſt, T. my g. P. endevour wholly to this: or let this be your whole care.
               
            
            that
            not one ſparkle
            of that horrible war
            be left vnquenched.
            Which
            if you do,
            you ſhall both exceedingly benefit
            the common-wealth,
            and
            get your ſelfe renowne for ever.

               Fare you well.
         
         
            Cicero S. D. Papirio Paeto. 25 9 23
            
            I came
            yeſterday
            to Cumane farme:
            to morrow
            to you
            peraduenture.
            But
            when
            I know
            the certainty,
            I will acquaint you therewith
            a little before.
            Although
            
               Marcus▪ Ceparius
            
            when
            he had met me
            in the Hen-wood,
            and I had aſked him
            what you were a doing
            ſaid,
            that you were
            in bedde,
            becauſe
            you were ſticke of the goute,
            
               v.  you laboured of the feet. 
            I tooke the matter forſooth heauily,
            as
            it was my part:
            but yet
            I determined
            to come
            vnto you,
            that
            I might both ſée
            you,
            and
            viſite you,
            and
            ſuppe with you too:
            for I do not thinke
            that you haue
            a gouty Cooke too.
            Then looke for
            a gueſt,
            as no great eater,
            ſo
            
               an enemy
            to chargeable ſuppers.
            Fare you well.
         
         
            Cicero S. D. Plancio. 26 4 15.
            
            I haue received
            your very ſhort letter,
            wherein
            I could not
            know
            that
            which
            I deſired
            to underſtand.
            I perceived,
            that
            ye I doubted not of.
            For
            I underſtood not
            how well
            you bore
            the common calamities:
            but I eaſily perceiued
            how well you loved mee,
            yet I had had proofe of this
            
               v.  But I had knowne this, 
            if I had knowne
            that:
            I would haue framed
            my letter
            thereunto.
            But
            although
            I writ
            before
            thoſe things which
            I thought meet
            to be ſignified vnto you
            
               v.  to be written, 
            Yet
            I thought
            you were to be put in minde
            in a word or twaine,
            
               v.  briefly, 
            at this time,
            that you ſhould not thinke,
            
               that you were
            in any private dāger.
            We all
            are
            in great,
            but yet
            in the common.
            Wherefore
            you ought not
            either
            to deſire
            a private and ſingular eſtate,
            
               v.  a proper and ſpeciall fortune, 
            or
            to refuſe
            the common.
            And therefore
            let vs carry ye minde
            one towards
            another
            
               v.  let vs bee of that mind betweene our ſelues 
            as we haue alwayes done.
            Which
            I may
            hope for
            on your part,
            and performe
            on mine owne.
            Fare you well.

            I rejoyce
            on the behalfe of our Baiae:
            
            
               v.  The Cittie Baiae in Campania, where were Bathes: 
            for
            as
            you write,
            they are
            
               id eſt,  the bathes at Baiae. 
            ſuddenly
            become
            wholſome:
            except
            peradventure
            they loue
            you,
            
               and
            flatter
            you:
            and
            ſo long
            as
            you are there,
            haue forgot
            themſelues.
            Which
            if it be ſo,
            I marvell not
            that even heaven
            and
            earth,
            if
            it be ſo fit
            for you,
            to abate
            their violence.
            
               v.  their force. 
            I had
            with me
            that that I thought not of,
            the little Oration
            for Dejotarus,
            
            which
            you deſired:
            therefore
            haue I ſent
            it
            you.
            I would haue you ſo reade it
            as
            a ſlender and barren matter.
            and not greatly worthy
            the writing.
            But
            I was deſirous
            to ſend
            a little gift
            ſlender and courſe.
            
               v.  a garment ſleightly woven with a groſſe thread. 
            ſuch as
            his gifts
            are wont
            to be,
            unto mine old hoſte
            and friend.
            I would haue you to be
            
               of a wiſe and couragious minde,
            that
            your modeſty
            and gravity
            may blaſe abroad
            the uniuſt dealing of others.
            Fare you well.

            I am very familiarly acquainted with
            
               Marcus Fabius,
            
            a very honeſt man,

            and
            one that is well learned.
            And I do loue
            him
            marvailouſly well,
            both
            for his excellent wit.
            and very great learning:
            as alſo
            for his ſingular modeſty.
            I would haue you ſo to vndertake
            his buſineſſe,
            as
            if
            it were
            mine owne matter.
            I know
            you
            to be
            great Orators:
            hee muſt commit murther at leaſt
            that would
            vſe
            your helpe.
            But
            I admit of
            no excuſe
            touching this man.
            You ſhall leape

            I do earneſtly expect
            and
            long after
            matters of Rome:
            and principally
            I deſire
            to know
            how you do:
            for no newes
            this good while
            was brought
            unto vs,
            by reaſon of the hardneſſe of ye winter.
            
               v.  for the greatneſſe of w. 
            Fare you well.
         
         
            Cicero S.D. Trebatio. 29 7 22
            
            You ieſted at me
            yeſterday,
            in our meryment,
            
               v.  among the cups, 
            becauſe
            I had ſaid
            it was a controuerſy
            whether an heire might
            well
            haue an action of the theft,
            which theft
            had bene committed
            before.
            Therefore,
            although
            I returned
            home
            well whitled,
            and late:
            yet
            noted I
            that chapter,
            where
            this queſtion,
            
               v.  t. controuerſie, 
            is handled:
            
               v.  is. 
            
               and
            haue ſent it
            written out
            vnto you:
            that
            you may know
            that Sextus Elius,
            
            
               M. Manlius,
            
            
               M. Brutus
            
            judged
            that
            which
            you ſaid
            no body
            had judged.
            Yet I
            agree
            unto Scevola
            
            and
            
               Teſta.
            
            Fare you well.

            Although
            your letter
            liked me wonderfully well,
            yet
            it did me more good
            that
            in your greateſt imployment
            you charged
            your fellow Officer Plancus
            
            to excuſe you
            to me
            by writing,
            which thing
            he performed
            carefully.
            Surely I can like nothing better
            
               v.  but nothing more amiable to me 
            then your dutifulnes
            and

            with your league-fellow,

            & Citizens of Rome.
            As for that which remaineth
            on forward, good Brutus,
            
            and now
            ſtriue you
            not with others
            but
            with your ſelfe.
            I ſhould not

            unto you,
            whom
            I purpoſe
            to uſe
            as my authour for brevity.
            I doe earneſtly looke for

            and indeed

            Fare you well.
         
         
            Marcus Cicero S.D. T. Furfano procoſ. 31 6 9
            
            I haue alwaies had
            ſo great familiarity
            and acquaintance
            with Aulus Cecinna,
            
            that
            none
            can
            be
            greater.
            For
            we haue lived very much with
            both
            his father,
            
               an honourable perſon
            and
            a couragious man.
            And
            I haue ever ſo loved
            this man
            from a child,
            becauſe
            both
            hee put mee in great hope,
            of very good behaviour
            & ſingular eloquence,
            and
            did liue
            with me
            very familiarly,
            not onely
            in the duties
            of friendſhip,
            but alſo
            in common ſtudies:
            that
            I could not liue
            more inwardly
            with any man,
            I haue no great cauſe
            
               v.  it nothing pertaineth 
            to write more,
            
               v.  mee to w. many things, 
            You ſee
            how needfull
            it is
            for me
            to defend
            his ſafety,
            and
            eſtate,
            
               v.  fortunes, 
            by what meanes ſoever
            I may.
            It remaineth,
            that,
            ſeeing
            I haue knowne
            by many occaſions,
            what
            you thinke
            both
            of the ſtate
            of good men,
            and
            of the miſeries
            
               of ye common-wealth
            I craue
            nothing elſe

            ſo great an encreaſe

            which
            you are to haue
            of Caecinna
            
            of your owne accord
            as
            I underſtand
            that I am eſteemed
            of you.
            You can
            do
            no greater pleaſure
            for me
            then this.
            Fare you well.

            Your letter
            was well pleaſing
            unto mee,
            ſave that
            you thought ſcorne of
            the ſmall place of lodging at Sinueſſa.
            
            Which ſcorning,
            the little ſilly village
            will ſurely take in ill part at your hands,
            except
            you do make a full requitall
            
               v.  you reſtore all for all, 
            in Cumaine
            
            and Pompeian.
            
            Thus then
            ſhall you do,
            and ſhall loue me,
            and
            ſhall moue me
            
               by one writing or other.
            For I can
            anſwere
            more eaſily.
            then provoke.
            But if
            you ſhould loyter,
            as it is your faſhion,
            I will prouoke:
            neither
            ſhall your ſlackneſſe infect me with

               Caius Anicius,
            
            my very good acquaintance,
            a man
            beautified
            with all good qualities
            is gone ambaſſadour
            into Affricke
            on a purchaſed embaſſage
            about his owne buſineſſes.
            I would haue you helpe
            him
            by all meanes,
            and doe the beſt you can,
            that

            as conveniently as may be:
            and eſpecially
            
               I recommend

            which
            my ſelfe
            unrequeſted
            haue beene wont

            The ſhortneſſe
            of your letter
            makes
            me ſhorter too
            in writing:
            and
            to ſpeake the truth,
            I remēber not matter

ſufficient
            to write of,
            for I am well aſſured
            that our affaires
            were brought
            unto you,
            even when they were a doing:
            
               v.  in the deedes, or in things done: 
            but we are ignorant of
            yours.
            For as though
            Aſia
            were ſhut up,
            ſo
            nothing
            is brought
            unto vs
            but rumors,
            that Dolabella hath the worſt,
            
               v. of Dola: oppreſſed,
               
            
            and ſuch indéed as do hold,
            
               v:  they indeed conſtant enough, 
            but hitherto,
            without author.
            When
            wee thought
            that the warre was ended,
            ſodainely
            we were brought
            into very great ſorrow
            by your kinſman Lepidus.
            
            
               v.  by y. L. 
            Therefore
            perſwade
            your ſelfe,
            the greateſt hope
            of the publicke ſtate
            is
            in you,
            and
            in your forces.
            We haue
            a very ſtrong army,
            but yet
            to the end, that
            all things
            may go well with vs,
            (as I hope they do)
            it ſtands vs much vpon
            
               that you do come:
            for the hope
            of the publicke
            is
            ſmall,
            for
            I may not ſay
            none:
            but
            whatſoeuer it be,
            it is greatly feared,
            
               v. it is deſpaired of, it is loſt: or as Manutius ſaith, it is promiſed,
               
            
            in the yeare

            Fare you well.
         
         
            Cicero S. D. Acilio procoſ. 35 13 30
            
            
               Lucius Manlius,
            
            is
            of Soff,
            
               v.  ſome ſay of Socum 
            
               ſome of Suſa,
            
            
               ſome at Soſi,
            
            he was of Catina,
            
            but
            he was made free of Rome
            together
            with the other Neapolitans,
            and an Alderman
            at Naples.
            For he was made frée
            of that Corporation,
            before the freedome was granted
            unto his fellowes
            and the Latines.
            His brother
            is lately dead
            at Catina.
            we ſuppoſe
            that he ſhall haue
            no controuerſy at all
            about that inheritance;
            and at this day,
            he is in poſſeſſion of the goods.
            But
            becauſe
            
               he hath
            his old buſineſſes
            beſides
            in his owne countrie Sicily:
            I do recommend
            both
            this inheritance of his brothers,
            and
            all things which are his
            unto you:
            and eſpecially
            himſelfe,
            a very good man,
            and my familiar acquaintance,
            addicted to thoſe ſtudies
            of learning
            and knowledge,
            wherewith
            I am moſt delighted.
            I therefore craue
            of you,
            that,
            whether
            he ſhallbe there
            or
            he do dot come
            into Sicily,
            you would take him
            to be
            amongſt my deareſt
            and neareſt friends:
            and that you deale ſo with him
            that
            hee may take knowledge
            that my cōmendation
            hath helped him very much.
            Fare you well.

            See
            how great courteſie,
            
               v.  h. g. ſweetneſſe: or ſee how pleaſing a man you are, 
            there is
            
               in you:
            we haue beene
            two howers
            at Thyrium.
            
            Our hoſt Xenomanes
            
            loues you as entirely well
            as
            if
            he lived
            with you.
            He hath promiſed
            all things
            which
            ſhall be
            needfull
            for you.
            I thinke
            he will be as good as his word.
            It would pleaſe mee well
            if you were
            ſtronger,
            that
            you might goe
            to Leucades,
            that
            there
            you might get ſtrēgth perfectly,
            
               v.  y. might confirme your ſelfe 
            you ſhall take heed
            what Curius thinks well of,
            what Lyſo,
            
            what the Phyſition.
            I was deſirous
            to ſend backe
            
               Mario
            
            unto you,
            whom
            when
            you were a little better,
            you might ſend
            unto me.
            But
            I thought
            that Mario could
            bring
            but one letter,
            but I doe expect
            many.
            You may then ſend,
            
               v.  y. m. t. 
            and ſhall cauſe
            
               that
            
               Acaſtus,
            
            (if you loue me)
            bee
            daily,
            at the haven.
            There will bee
            many
            to whom
            you may
            ſafely deliuer
            a letter,
            who
            will willingly bring it
            unto me.
            I ſurely
            will let none ſcape
            that goes to Patras,
            I haue
            all hope
            in Curius,
            
            of looking carefully unto you.
            It is not poſſible a man ſhould bee more kind then he
            
               v.  Nothing can bee made more humaine then he, 
            or loue vs better.
            
               v.  nothing more loving, 
            commit
            your ſelfe
            wholly
            unto him.
            I had rather
            ſee
            you in health
            ſomewhat late,
            
               v.  ſo w. after 
            then
            preſently
            weake.
            Regard then
            no other thing,
            but
            that
            you may be well.
            I will looke to
            the reſt.
            Fare you well heartily,
            as I was going
            from Leucades,

            I wrote
            this third Epiſtle
            unto you
            in one and the ſame day,
            rather
            for to continue my determination,
            
               v,  for the cauſe of holding my d. 
            becauſe
            I had gotten
            one to whom I might deliuer them,
            then
            that
            I had
            what I might write,
            the ſame then againe,
            
               ſup. ſcribamus,  lets thē write the ſame againe

            ſo haue you care of your ſelfe.
            
               v.  adde ſo much diligence in your ſelfe. 
            To your innumerable ſeruices
            towards me
            adde
            this one,
            which
            ſhall be

            the moſt acceptable
            of all
            unto me.
            Seeing
            you haue had
            (as I hope)
            a regard
            of your health,
            
               haue alſo
            of your comming by ſea,
            you ſhall ſend me letters
            by all that come
            into Italy,
            as
            I
            let none ſcape
            that come
            to Patras,
            Good Tyro
            
            haue a care of
            your ſelfe:
            ſeeing
            it fell not out,
            that
            you ſhould ſaile with us,
            there is no cauſe,
            that you ſhould make any haſt:
            nor
            care for any thing,
            but
            that
            you may be well.

            And I do deſire too
            that you
            come

            I am affraid of

            from ſore diſeaſes,
            if any errour

            Now
            
               id eſt.  from the beginning of your iourney towards Cumaine, vntill your returne, will be ful ſeven daies. 
            to thoſe two daies
            while

            on the way,
            untill
            you come
            into Cumaine
            fiue daies
            will be added
            together
            
               v.  continually 
            vnto your returne.
            I will
            bee
            in Formian
            about the third before the Kalends
            
               id eſt.  about the nine and twentieth, or thirtieth day. 
            See, my good Tyro,
            
            that
            I may finde
            you

            with longing after you.
            Yet

            You are not ignorant
            that there be
            many kindes
            of Epiſtles,
            but
            this one
            is moſt manifeſt,
            for whoſe ſake
            the thing it ſelfe
            was inuented,
            that
            we ſhould certifie
            them that be abſent
            if there were any thing,
            which
            concerned
            either
            us
            or
            them
            yt they ſhould know
            you do not ſurely expect
            a letter
            of this kind
            from me:
            for you haue
            both
            writers
            and
            meſſengers
            of your own houſhold matters.
            but
            there is no newes at all
            in my matters.
            There bee
            two ſorts
            of letters
            remaining,
            which
            do very much delight
            me:
            one
            familiar
            and
            mercy:
            the ſecond
            ſober
            and
            graue.
            
               I wot not well,
            whether of the two
            may leaſt beſeeme
            mee
            to uſe.
            What, ſhould I ſport
            with you
            in a letter?
            In very deed,
            I thinke
            that he is not
            a citizen
            which
            can
            be merry

            in theſe times.
            Or
            ſhall I write of
            ſome graver matter?
            What is there
            which
            may
            bee grauely written on
            by Cicero
            
            to Curio,
            
            except it be
            of ye cōmon-wealth?
            But
            this
            is
            my ſtate
            in this kind,
            that
            I would not willingly
            
               v.  I neither would 
            write
            the things which
            I do not thinke.
            
               obſeruandum, non ſcribi & nunc.
            
            Wherefore
            ſeeing
            I haue
            no matter
            to write of,
            left
            unto me,
            I will uſe
            that ſhutting up
            which
            I am wont:
            and I will incourage
            
               you
            to the ſtudy
            of the chiefeſt commendation,
            for an expectation beyond that may bee imagined
            is appointed
            and
            prepared
            as a grieuous adverſary
            for you,
            which
            you ſhall very eaſily vanquiſh
            by one meanes,
            if
            you make this your reſolution,
            that you muſt labour earneſtly
            in thoſe Arts,
            
               v.  in thoſe, 
            whereby
            
               v.  by which Arts 
            thoſe praiſes
            are obtained,
            the glory whereof
            
               v.  the glo. of which prayſes 
            you haue exceedingly loved.
            I would write
            many things
            to this purpoſe,
            if I did not verily thinke
            
               v.  unleſſe I did truſt 
            that you were
            ſufficiently forward
            of your owne ſelfe:
            and
            I haue not done
            this
            whatſoever
            I haue lightly touched,
            for to pricke you forward,
            
               v.  for the cauſe of enflaming you, 
            but
            to teſtifie my good will.
            Fare you well.

            I am very familiarly acquainted with
            
               Licius Ticius Strabo,
            
            a Gentleman of Rome,

            were
            mine owne:
            as it is a more laudable thing
            to take paines
            about their friendes money,
            thē about their own,

            am
            my ſelfe
            to be comforted,
            becauſe
            I haue taken
            nothing
            more grievouſly

            Your vertue

            Heretofore
            I had onely ſome liking of
            
               Dolabella:
            
            I was
            no whit engaged
            unto him,
            neither in truth fell it out
            that I néeded him:
            yet he was indebted unto me
            becauſe
            I had not failed him
            in his diſtreſſes.
            At this time,
            am I bound
            through ſo great a good turne of his,
            becauſe
            very aboundantly
            hee hath giuen mee
            contentment
            
               both
            before this

            at this time
            in your ſafety,
            that
            I am indebted
            more
            to no man.
            In which buſineſſe
            
               v.  In which thing 
            ſo heartily
            do I rejoyce
            on your behalfe,
            that
            I had rather
            you ſhould reioyce likewiſe

            At any hand I deſire not

            you may
            very well
            doe
            the other.
            As for that which remaineth,
            becauſe
            your vertue
            and
            honour
            hath opened you
            a way to returne
            to your friends,
            it is a point of wiſedome in you,
            & noblenes of minde,
            to forget
            that that you haue loſt;
            to thinke vpon
            that yt you haue recouered.
            You ſhall liue
            with your friends,
            you ſhall liue
            with vs;
            you haue gotten
            more honour,

            that you were not unmindfull

health, in your words,

            Or if
            the feare

               i.  of the warre which is like to bee this Summer.

            deviſe
            one thing or other,
            
               v.  ſomething, 
            as
            you did
            about Britaine.
            Very gladly ſure

            that you were
            familiar with
            
               Caeſar,
            
            yet in truth,
            
               I would rather chuſe
            that
            which
            were
            more convenient,
            to underſtand
            very often
            of your owne matters
            by you owne letters.
            which doubtleſſe
            might thus bee brought about,
            if
            you would rather chuſe
            throughly to learne
            the lawes
            
               i.  to loue your friend well, rather then to bee a cunning brabler, 
            of friendſhip
            then
            of diſcord.
            But
            I haue merily ſpokē
            
            
               n. pln. pro ſing.
            
            theſe things,
            both
            after your faſhion,
            and
            ſomewhat too
            after mine,
            
               n.n.n. plu. pro ſing.
            
            I loue you heartily,

            that you do loue mée.
            Fare you well.

            I thinke
            you haue intelligence of
            the wicked pranke

            I am well aſſured
            was ſent

            Therefore
            the warre being ended
            as
            we did thinke,
            we

            that
            you be
            in moſt honourable ſtate:
            I tooke it in ill part
            that you ſhewed not your ſelfe thankefull

            ſeeing
            you were
            graced
            by that ſtate
            with the greateſt honours.
            I reioyce
            that you are

            more wiſely
            in my iudgement,

            that ſuch as haue bene Conſuls

            You know not

            Neither

            My good Cicero,
            
            do not thinke,
            that I ſpeake this to flatter you.

            And I acknowledge him

            my auncient Hoſt,
            and
            beſide hoſpitality,

               Caeſar
            
            made free of Coma
            by my meanes.
            
               v.  by my benefite. 
            But he got
            the name of Avianus
            
            becauſe
            he was acquainted with

            I thinke
            you know.
            All which
            I haue gathered
            that
            you might vnderſtād

            I do therefore craue
            at your hands
            that
            you would ſtand his friend

            you may
            doe
            without trouble to your ſelfe,
            and account him
            
               v.  and haue 
            as one of your owne friends
            
               v.  in the number of yours 
            and carefully provide
            that
            he may know
            that this letter of mine
            hath ſtood him in great ſtead,

            Your remembrance
            of us
            which
            you ſignified
            in your letter,
            is excéedingly well pleaſing
            unto me:
            which
            I deſire earneſtly
            that
            you would continue:
            
               v.  t. you w. preſerue 
            not that I doubt
            of your conſtancy,
            but
            becauſe
            the manner
            of deſiring
            is ſo:
            Some very ſeditious matters
            are told
            us
            out of Syria,
            which
            becauſe
            they be
            neerer
            you,
            then
            us,
            do the rather move
            me
            for your ſake
            then
            for mine owne.
            There is
            exceeding great quietneſſe
            at Rome,
            but ſo,
            that one would rather haue
            
               
               v. th.y.w. rather haue

            which
            I hope
            will be

            I perceiue
            
               v.  I ſee 
            
               Caeſar hath care therof.
            
               v.  t. to be a care to C. 
            Know you
            that I
            ſo long as
            you be away,
            haue gotten
            (as it were)
            ſome occaſion
            and
            liberty
            to write
            more boldly,
            and indeed
            perchance
            the reſt,
            which
            even your ſelfe
            would yeeld unto.
            But
            laſt of all
            I haue written
            of the beſt kind
            of pleading.
            Wherein
            many times
            I haue feared
            that you
            do a little diſſent
            from our opinion:
            namely ſo,
            as
            one learned man
            from another not vnlearned.
            I could moſt heartily wiſh
            that you would giue approbation
            to this brooke,
            out of your iudgement,
            if not
            
               for affection ſake,
            
               v.  for the cauſe of fauour. 
            I will bid
            your friends
            to write it out
            
               v.  t. they write it ouer 
            if they would,
            and ſend it
            unto you.
            For I am of this minde,
            
               v.  f. I thinke 
            although
            you ſhal hardly like of
            the worke
            yet
            in this great leaſure
            
               v.  in th. ſolitarineſſe 
            whatſoever
            comes
            from me,
            will be
            well-pleaſing
            unto you.
            Whereas
            you do recommend
            your reputation
            and honour
            unto me:
            you deale indeed
            after the faſhion
            of all:
            but
            I would haue you thus to thinke,
            that I,
            both
            do attribute
            very much
            to the loue
            which
            I know
            to bee
            reaſonably equall
            
               v.  mutuall 
            betweene us:
            as alſo
            yt I haue that conceit
            of your paſſing great wit
            and
            of your excellent ſtudies,
            and
            of the hope
            
               of moſt honourable promotion
            that
            I can preferre
            none
            before you,
            compare with you
            a few.
            Fare you well.

            Whereas
            many things
            bee
            acceptable
            unto me,
            which
            you
            moved
            by my commendations
            haue done:
            ſo eſpecally
            that
            that you haue moſt bountifully entertained

            the ſonne
            of my friend
            and
            interpreter
            
               v.  one that uſes to go before me, a meſſenger. 
            For he came
            to Laodicea,
            and
            ſhewed himſelfe excéedingly thankfull
            both
            unto you
            being with mee
            and
            to me
            for your ſake.
            Wherefore
            as for that that remaines
            I craue
            at your hands
            ſeeing
            you beſtow
            
               your kindneſſe
            upon gratefull perſons,
            that
            ſo much ye more willingly
            you would pleaſure
            them
            and doe your endeavour
            ſo far forth as
            your credit
            will permit,
            that
            the mother-in law
            of the yong man
            bee not found guilty.
            Whereas
            I recommended
            
               Marke Marcilius
            
            heretofore
            earneſtly,
            ſo
            at this inſtant
            much more earneſtly,
            becauſe
            in his long purſevant-ſhip
            
               v.  in the long performance of his office, attendance 
            I had experience of

            the ſingular
