xxij. Theſe ben y• wordes
of Salomon / thus
moche to ſaye in Englyſſhe.
The riche and the poore mette
to gydre / the lorde is fourmer of theym
bothe. This texte worſhypfull Beda
expowneth thus. A riche man is not
to be worſhypped for this cauſe oonly
that he is riche / neyther a poore man
is to be deſpyſed bycauſe of his pouerte
but the werke of god is to be worſhypped
in them bothe / for they bothe ben
made to the ymage & to the lykeneſſe
of god. And as it is wryten Sapiencie
vij. ca. One maner of entrynge in to
this worlde / and a lyke maner of outgooynge
fro this wretched worlde is
to all men bothe riche & poore. For bothe
riche & poore comen in to this worlde
naked & poore / wepyng & weylyng / &
bothe they departen hens naked and
poore with moche payne. Neuertheleſſe
the riche & the poore in theyr lyuynges
in this worlde in many thynges ben
full vnlyke. For the riche man haboū
                  deth
in treſour of golde & ſyluer & other
richeſſes. He hath grete honours and
erthly delytes / where the poore creature
lyueth in grete penury & payne / and
for lackyng of richeſſes ſuffreth colde &
honger / & is ofte in deſpyte. ¶Pauper.
I that am a poore caytyfe ſymple & lytyll
ſette by / beholdyng the proſperyte
of them y• ben riche / & the dyſeaſe that
I ſuffre & other poore men lyke vnto
me am many a tyme ſteryd to grutche
& to be wery of my lyfe. But thanne
rēnen to my mynde the wordes of Salomon
before reherſed / how the lorde
made as well the poore as the riche.
And therto Iob wytneſſeth / that nothyng
in erthe is made without cauſe
Iob .v. ¶Thenne I ſuppoſe within
my ſelfe / that by y• preuy domes of god
that be to me vnknowen / it is to me
prouffytable to be poore. For well I wote
that god is no nygarde of his gyftes
¶But as the apoſtle ſayth Rom̄ .viij.
To them that ben choſen of god alle
thynges werken to gydre in to good.
¶And ſoo ſythen I truſte thorugh the
goodnes of god to be one of his choſen
I can not deme but yt to me it is good
to be poore. ¶Moreouer ſaynt Poule .i.
Thimoth .vi. wryteth in this maner.
They that wyll or deſyre to be made
riche falle in to temptacōn & in to the
ſnare of the deuyll / & in to many deſyres
vnprouffytable & noyous. For coue
tyſe of richeſſes more than is nedefull
to a man for to haue / is rote of all euylles.
Experyence accordeth with this
ſawe of the apoſtle. ¶For leſynges &
periuryes / fals ſubtyltees & gyles / & many
other wyckedneſſes ben as comon
as the cartewaye with ſuche inordynate
louers of richeſſe / whiche ſynnes brȳ

¶It is an olde prouerbe. He is

¶Pauper. Lordſhyppe is taken in dyuerſe
maners. Ther is naturell or kyndely
lordſhyppe. Ther is alſo cyuyle or
ſeculer lordſhyp. And ther is lordſhyp
pretenſe. Of naturell lordſhyp ſpeketh
the ſcrypture that ye alleged. For god
ordeyned in the ſtate of Innocencye
man kyndely to haue ſoueraynte ouer
beſtes fyſhes and byrdes. And this maner
of lordſhypp ordeyned by waye of
kynde may a Iuſte man haue without
habondaunce of worldely richeſſe. To
ſeculer or cyuyle lordſhyppe Introducte
by occaſyon of ſynne perteyneth
worldely richeſſe / whiche maner lordſhyp
longeth to kynges / dukes / erles / &
other lower lordes. Yf I that am a

Syr yf ye marke well this dyſtynccyon

riche man may better gyue than may
the poore / for he hath more wherof. Ergo
it is more blyſfull to be riche than

¶Pauper. That cryſte ſayth
may not be falſe. But ye riche men take
full moche & gyue oftentyme full lytyll
for the loue of god. ¶Ye take the
grete and gyue the ſmalle / ye take moche
more than taketh y• poore. And the
more that ye take to harder ye be boū

dona creſcunt tanto creſcunt raciones
donorum. The more that gyftes
encreaſe / the more encreaſe rekenynges
of gyftes / and ſaynt Poule ſayth to the
riche man. Quid habes qd nō accepiſti
What haſt thou / that thou haſt not receyued

ye riche men ben all on the takyng ſyde

poore man taketh but lytyll / and gyueth
full moche. For one peny gyuen
of the poore man is more in goddes
ſyght in caſe / than twenty pounde gyuen
of the riche. And therfore Cryſte
ſayth in the goſpell Luce .xxi. that the
poore wydowe whiche offred but two
mytes in the Temple / that is but one
ferthynge / ſhe offred more than dyde
all men and wȳmen that daye / & yet
it was full grete offryng. For as cryſte

Beacius eſt dare &

by theſe wordes riche men that gyue

commendeth them mooſt whiche forſake
worldely richeſſe & trauayle neuertheleſſe

lytyl as they may gete Iuſtely to helpe
the poore nedy. Or ellys it may be vnderſtonde
thus. That to euery man be
he riche be he poore / yf he haue ony
thyng whiche he may forbere / it is better
to hȳ with ſuche as he may to helpe
other that ben poore & nedy / than
hym ſelfe to take gyftes of other men
¶Moreouer ſythen the poore wydowe
that offred but .ij. mytes gaaf ſo grete
a gyfte bycauſe of her good wyll. A
man that forſaketh the worlde / and gyueth
awaye all that he hath for the loue
of god / and alſo forſaketh therwith
couetyſe of hauynge / ſaue oonly that
hym bare nedeth / bycauſe that he ſoo
dyſcarged hym of worldely beſyneſſe / may
be the more ghooſtly occupyed he
gyueth a full grete gyfte / ye ſoo grete
a gyfte that a riche man as he kepeth
his richeſſe with couetyſe may not gyue
ſo moche as ſuche a poore man gyueth.
Ergo ſyr by your owne wordes
ſuche a poore man is more bleſſyd than
many that ben full riche.

poore ben two thynges full neceſſarye
eche to other. And I ſaye moreouer the
riche man hath more nede than ye poore.

other ſymple thynges / and fewe neceſſaryes

& to his aſtate / he careth not but
for hym ſelfe or for fewe mo. But the
riche man carith for his perſone for his
aſtate / for his grete meyne / for his worſhyp
/ for his goodes. He hath nede of
moche golde & ſyluer / moche meyne / many
vytayles. He hath nede of many
mennes helpe / of ſeruauntes / of labourers
/ men of crafte / of men of lawe / of
grete lordſhyp without whiche he may
not mayntene his aſtate ne his richeſſe
The poore nedeth but lytyll of all this
He that moche hath byhoueth moche.
And he that hath leſſe byhoueth leſſe.
The riche man muſt gyue to his frendes
to haue theyr aſſyſtence / and theyr
helpe. He gyueth his enemyes to lette
theyr malyce. And ſoo of moche richeſſes
he gyueth but lytyll for to helpe his
ſoule with. The poore man of lytyll
may gyue lytyll and hath moche thanke
of god. Soo the riche man nedeth
more and hath more nede and myſchyef
than hath the poore man. For
the more that he hath / the more hym
nedeth / and in more myſchyef and in
more perell he is nyght and daye. For
as the hous that ſtandeth hyghe on a
hylle is in more tempeſt than the hous
in the valaye. Soo men of hyghe dygnyte

ben in mooſt drede and mooſt

               DIues. I aſſente to this expoſycyon.
I was aferde that god
hadde not loued riche men.
¶Pauper. Abraham Yſaac & Iacob
y• holy patryarkes were full riche men
& yet god loued them full well. Dauyd
Ezechie & Ioſie were kynges of goddes
people / moche loued & prayſed of
god. Ioſeph Danyell rulers of royalmes
were of god choſen. Iob Iachee
Ioſeph of Aromathye were full riche
men / & now ben ful hygh in blyſſe. For
ye riche men be not lacked in holy wryte
for theyr richeſſes / but for her wycked
couetyſe and myſwyll of richeſſe.
And therfore ſayth ſaynt Ambroſe ſuꝑ
Lucam / that the faute is not in the richeſſe
/ but in theym that can not vſe
theyr richeſſe in due maner. And therfore
ſayth he / that right as richeſſe is
lettyng of vertue to wycked men / ſo it
is helpynge of vertue to good men. Ne
poore men be not prayſed ſo moche in
holy wryte for wantynge of richeſſe / ne
for myſchyef that they ben in / but
for theyr good wyll & theyr good loue
that they haue to god. Whan for his loue
they forſake richeſſe / and put them
in pouerte & myſchyef to ſerue theyr
god the more frely without lettyng of
worldely couetyſe. For more ſhrewes
fynde I none than poore beggers that
haue no good that the worlde hath forſake
/ but they not the worlde. ¶Diues
Therfore me thynketh alwaye that it
is better to be riche than poore. For pouerte
& myſchyef drawe many a man
to robbery / manſlaughter / & lecherye / &
other ſynnes many moo. And therfore
ſayth Salomon, Propter inopiam
multi deliquerūt. Eccleſiaſtes .xxviij.
¶Pauper. Some be poore & nedy by
theyr good wyll / & ſome ayenſt theyr
wyll. And they that ben poore ayenſt
theyr wyll / ſome haue pacyence / & ſome
haue noo pacyence / & they bycauſe
of myſchyef they lyghtly fall in ſynne
But neyther pouerte wylfully taken
for the loue of god / ne pouerte that falleth
to man ayenſt his wyll / bryngeth
man to ſynne yf he haue pacyence. More
ouer I ſaye that couetyſe of richeſſe
is more cauſe of ſynne than pouerte.
And therfore ſayth ſaynt Poule that
couetyſe is rote of all maner wyckedneſſe.
And the poore man dare not / ne
may not ſynne / ne mayntene his ſynne
as the riche man may. For he may
ſooner be punyſſhed & chaſtyſed than
the riche man. Alſo ther is nede of pouerte
and nede of couetyſe. For as Salomon
ſayth / the coueytous man hath
neuer ynough / but for myſchyef of her
te he leſeth his ſoule. And of this myſchyef
& nede ſpeketh Salomon y• wordes
that thou alleggeſt.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .viij.
               DIues. I here by thy talkyng
thou art a lettred man / what
canſt thou ſaye to the wordes
of Salomon Prouerb .xxx. Where he
prayed thus. Mendicitatē & diuicias ne
dederis michi / ne egeſtate compreſſus
periurē nomen dei. Lorde he ſayth gyue
me neyther grete richeſſe ne beggery
that I be not cōſtrayned by nede to for
ſwere my goddes name / & holy chirche
ſyngeth & ſayth. Diuicias & pauꝑtates
ne dederis michi. Lorde ſayth he gyue
me noo grete richeſſe / ne grete pouerte

wherby as me thynketh eche man ſholde
be beſye to flee pouerte beggery and
myſchyef. ¶Pauper. I praye the be as
beſye to forſake thy richeſſe by enſample
of Salomon / as thou art to ferſake
pouerte & beggerye. For in his prayer
in whiche be conteyned moo wordes
than thou reherſeſt / he forſoke bothe richeſſe
and beggery. But thou dooſt as
many men doon / thou alleggeſt the
ſcrypture as the lyſte / and applyeſt it
to thy fantaſye / and leueſt behynde
what the lyſte whiche is ayenſt thy fantaſye.
The hole prayer of Salomon
is this. Mendicitatem et diuicias ne
dederis michi. Tribue tantum victui
meo neceſſaria. Ne forte ſaciatus illiciar
ad negandum / et dicam quis eſt
dominus / et egeſtate compulſus furer
et periurem nomen dei mei. Beggery
he ſayth and richeſſe ne gyue thou
not to me / gyue thou oonly to my lyuelode
nedefull thynges. Leſt perauenture
I fulfylled be drawen to denye / and
ſaye who is the lorde. And throughe
nede conſtreyned ſtele / and forſwere
the name of my god. After the expoſycyon
of Beda and Lyra in this texte
Salomon prayeth to god that he be
not ſo fylled with richeſſes / that he for
pryde & habondaunce of worldly goodes
forgete his god and endeles goodes
Alſo on that other ſyde that vnpacyence
of pouerte compelle hym not to ſtele
neyther to forſwere hym. In whiche
prayer he refuſeth noo more pouerte / than
he dooth habondaūce of richeſſe.
But his prayer Indyfferentely beholdeth
grete richeſſe / and moche pouerte.
Alſo ſyr ſaaf thy pacyence / thou reherſeſt
the wordes of Salomons prayer
with falſe Englyſſhe and not conuenyent.
For he ſayd not gyue me neyther
richeſſe ne beggerye as thou ſaydeſte.
But he ſayd gyue me rycheſſe and beggerye.
That is to ſaye / gyue me not richeſſe
with nygardſhyppe and ſtraytneſſe
of herte and couetyſe / whiche make
the riche man alwaye to begge and
craue. For as I ſayd Eccleſiaſtes the .v.
ca. The nygarde hath neuer ynough.
And ſoo by theſe wordes he prayeth to
god that yf he gyue hym richeſſe / that
he ſholde gyue hym therwith largeneſſe
of herte / and grace to ſpende them
to goddes worſhyppe / & to haue good
of his good by his lyfe. For as he ſayth
Eccleſiaſtes .vi. It is a grete myſchyue
and a grete vanyte that god gyueth
a man richeſſe / and goodes ynoughe
what he wyll haue. And with that he
gyueth hym no power for nygardſhyp
to haue parte therof / but kepeth theym
to the ſtraunger / whiche ſhall deuoure
all that he getteth with moche care.
Ayenſt this myſchyef and beggery of
couetyſe. Salomon made his prayer
ſayenge to the lorde / gyue me not richeſſe
and beggerye togyder. For ſuche
nygardſhyppe and beggerye maketh
riche men to forſake theyr god. So it
is vnderſtonde of beggerye & pouerte
ye cometh of myſcouetyſe / not of pouerte
and beggerye that cometh of nede
and wantynge of good. For the riche
man nedeth more to begge bodely
than the poore. ¶Diues. That is falſe.
¶Pauper. I preue it. Dauyd that
worthy kynge ſayd. Ego autem mendicus
ſum et parper. I am ſayd he a
begger and a poore man / where as the
gloſe ſayth thus. Beggyng is to axe a

thynge of an other that he hath not of
hym ſelfe. But the riche man nedeth
more than the poore for to axe helpe of
an other as I ſhewed here afore. Ergo
it nedeth hym more for to begge
than the poore man. ¶Diues. Alle
though we axe helpe of other men as
vs nedeth all / yet we paye theym for
theyr trauaylle and for theyr good / and
therfore it is noo beggerye / but a
couenaunte makynge / payeng / byeng / and
ſellynge. ¶Pauper. Full ofte ye
paye full euyll. Thou aſkeſte for the
loue of the penye / and a poore nedy
man axeth for the loue of god. Thou
proffereſt men of whome thou axeſt
bodely helpe the penye to theyr nede / and
god prouffereth hym ſelfe to mede
to theym that helpe poore men. ¶Diues.
All we be beggers gooſtly as ſayth
ſaynt Auſtyn / for we haue noo good
gooſtly but of goddes gyfte. ¶Pauper
Ergo we be all beggers bodely / for we
haue noo good bodely but of goddes
gyfte.

               DIues. Thy ſpeche is reſonable
/ but not moche pleaſaunt
to many riche. folke. I praye
the what is thy name. ¶Pauper. why
aſkeſt thou. ¶Dues. Twenty yere a
goo I ſpake with a man of thyn aſtate
that was full lyke the in ſpeche and
perſone. But he ſpake of ſo hygh perfeccyon
as thou now begynneſt for to
doo / that vnto this daye I coude neuer
atteyne therto. And he tolde me the ſame
tale of that yonge man that thou
toldeſt me now. ¶Pauper. Of whicht
yonge man. ¶Diues. Of hȳ that
aſked Cryſte what he ſholde do to haue
the blyſſe withouten ende. To whome
Cryſte taught hym that perfeccōn
that thou ſpekeſt of / and yet he dyde it
not no more than I doo. ¶Pauper.
Ther is two maner of perfeccyons / of
whiche Cryſte ſpake & taught yt yonge
riche man. Ther is perfeccyon leſſe / &
perfeccōn more. The fyrſte is nedefull
& ſuffycyent. The ſeconde is a paſſyng
holyneſſe & full excellent. Of the fyrſte
god ſayth. Perfectus eris ſine macula.
Gloſa criminali. Deu
                     •
                   .xviij. Thou
ſhalt ſayth he be perfyte without ſpotte
of dedely ſynne. Of this perfeccyon
ſpake Cryſte to that yonge riche man
whan he bad hym kepe the cōmaūdementes.
Of the ſeconde perfeccōn that
is ſoo excellent / he ſayd to hym. Si vis
perfectus eſſe &
                     •
                  . Yf thou wylt be perfyte
/ go and ſelle all that thou haſte and
gyue it to the poore folke & come and
folowe me. ¶Diues. The ſame tale
tolde me thy brother twenty yere paſte
But we ſpake than mooſt of the hygh
perfeccyon of excellencye. I praye the
lete vs now ſpeke a whyle of the leſſe
perfeccyon that is nedefull to all. For
ſythen I may not atteyne to the more
perfeccyon. I wolde as we muſte kepe
and holde well the leſſe perfeccyon.
¶Pauper. Do than as Cryſte taughte
that yonge riche man. Serua mandata.
Kepe well the commauadementes.
Haue one god in worſhyppe. Take
not his name in ydelneſſe. Halowe
the holy dayes. Fader and moder worſhyppe
and paye. Slee noo man. Doo
no folye by no woman. Loke that thou
ſtele not. And noo falſe wytneſſe that

thou bere. Coueyte thou not thy neyghbours
good with wronge houſe ne londe.
Deſyre not his wyfe ne his childe.
ne his ſeruaunt / ne his beeſt / ne onythynge
that to hym longeth. ¶Theſe
ben the .x. cōmaūdementes whiche god
wrote in .ij. tables of ſtone / & toke theȳ
Moyſes for to teche theym to the people.
¶The thre fyrſt cōmaūdementes
were wryten by theym ſelfe in the fyrſt
table. For tho pryncypaly teche vs how
we ſholde worſhyp our god / & loue hȳ
aboue all thynge / & therfore they ben
called the thre cōmaūdementes of the
fyrſte table. ¶The other .vij. ben called
of the ſeconde table / for they were
wryten in the ſeconde table. And they
teche vs how we ſholde worſhyp & loue
our euen cryſten as our ſelfe And ſo
all the .x. cōmaūdementes ben comprehended
in the two cōmaūdementes of
charyte. ¶Diues. Whiche ben tho.
¶Pauper. The fyrſte is that yu ſhalt
loue thy lorde god with all thyn herte
with all thy mynde / wt all thy myght
The ſeconde is that yu ſhalte loue thy
neyghbour as thy ſelfe / that is to ſaye
thou ſhalte loue hym to ye ſame blyſſe
that yu loueſt to thy ſelfe / & do to hym
as yu woldeſt men dyde to the / & not do
to hym but as yu woldeſt men dyde to
the / as longe as he kepeth the lawe of
charyte. For & yf he forfete & do ayenſt
charyte it is charyte to chaſtyſe hym &
punyſſhe hym tyll he wyll amende hȳ
for ſaluacōn of his ſoule / & enſample
of other. In theſe two cōmaūdementes
as Cryſte ſayth in the goſpell hangeth
all the lawe and all the prophecye.
And therfore ſaynt Poule ſayth
that loue and charyte is fulfyllynge of
alle the lawe.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .x.
               DIues. Me meruaylleth moche
why Cryſte taught more that
yonge riche man the cōmaundementes
of the ſeconde table / than of
the fyrſte / & why he taught hym more
how he ſhold loue his neyghbour / than
he ſholde loue his god. For neyther cryſte
ſpake to hym of the fyrſte cōmaundemente
of charyte / how he ſholde loue
his god aboue all thyng / ne how he
ſholde haue one god in worſhyppe / ne
how he ſholde flee periurye / ne that he
ſholde halowe the holy dayes. And yet
without kepyng of theſe may no man
be ſaued. ¶Pauper. Whan Cryſt bad
hym kepe the cōmaūdementes in generall
/ he bad hym kepe the .x. cōmaūdementes
& the two cōmaūdementes of
charyte / & al goddes heſtes & his lawes
But he ſpecyfyed more the cōmaundementes
of ye ſeconde table than of the
fyrſte / & more the ſeconde cōmaundemente
of charyte than the fyrſte / not
that he was more boūde therto / but for
he was more enclyned bycauſe of youthe
/ of richeſſes / & of lordſhyp to forfet
ayenſt tho cōmaūdementes than ayenſte
the other in the fyrſte table. For
youthe is enclyned to wrath / haſtyneſſe
/ fyghtynge / and ſoo to manſlaughter
/ to lecherye / auoutrye / to lyenge / &
ſo to falſe wytneſſe / to theeft / to pryde
& rebellyon / to indygnacōn / to deſpyte
of his elder. And ſo in many wyſe offendeth
his neyghbour & his euen cryſten.
And namely whan youth is vnder
ſette with richeſſe / & is at his owne rule

without drede of punyſſhyng / as that
yonge man was. For he was full riche
and he was a prynce leder and ruler of
the contre / as ſayth ſaynt Luke in his
goſpell. And therfore Cryſte mooſt ſouerayne
leche / not oonly taught hym
how he ſholde lyue withouten ende / but
moreouer he warned hym to what
ſekeneſſe he was mooſt dyſpoſed to / wherby
he myght leſe that lyfe & deye
withouten ende / & taught hym medycynes
ayenſt tho ſekeneſſes / whan he bad
hym not ſlee / do no lecherye / no thefte / bere
noo falſe wytneſſe / worſhyp fader
& moder / and in his reulynge loue his
neyghbour as hym ſelfe / & do to hym
as he wolde men dyde to hym. ¶Diues.
Why ſpecyfyed not Cryſte to hym
the two laſte cōmaūdementes of the ſeconde
table whiche be ayenſt falſe couetyſe.
¶Pauper. For yonge folke be
not ſoo moche enclyned to couetyſe as
they be to other ſȳnes. ¶Diues. That
is ſothe / for couetyſe reygneth mooſt in
olde folke. And ſo as men wexe in age
ſo encreaſeth theyr couetyſe. And whan
all other ſynnes forſake man for elde
and febleneſſe / than couetyſe is mooſt
breme. Pryde is fyrſte in youthe / couetyſe
laſt in age. Saye forth what thou
wylte.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .xi.
               PAuer. Euermore thou ſhalt vnderſtonde
that ther be two maner
of lyues by y• whiche man
may be ſaued. The fyrſt is contemplatyfe
/ the ſeconde actyfe. The fyrſt ſtondeth
pryncypally in beſyneſſe to knowe
god & goddes lawes / and to loue hym
aboue all thynge. The ſeconde ſtondeth
pryncypally in good dedes & good
rule & helpe of our euen cryſten. The
thre fyrſte cōmaūdementis of the fyrſt
table belongeth to all / but pryncypally
to them that ben in contemplatyf lyfe
that haue forſaken the worlde & worldely
beſyneſſe for the loue of god. The
ſeuen cōmaundementes of the ſeconde
table alſo longen to al. but pryncypally
to theym yt ben in actyfe lyfe & in beſyneſſe
of the worlde. The contemplatyf
lyf is in eaſe & reſt of herte. The actyf
lyfe is in doyng & traueyll & beſyneſſe
of body & ſoule. And of this lyfe ſpake
yt yonge riche man whan he ſayd. Lord
what ſhal I do / how ſhal I lyue to haue
the lyfe withouten ende. And Cryſte
taught hȳ what good dedes he ſholde
do / what myſdedes he ſholde flee / yf he
wolde kepe well the actyfe lyfe. Alſo yu
ſhalt vnderſtonde for this ſpeche of cryſte
& many ſuche other / yt cryſte in y• goſpell
& holy wryte by example of y• leſſe
preueth & ſheweth y• more. As whan he
ſayth yt men ſholde be ſaued at ye daye
of dome for they gaaf mete to the hungrye
/ drynke to the thruſtye / moche
more than ſholde they be ſaued that gaue
all that they hadde or myght haue
for the loue of god / & hem ſelfe to ſerue
god nyght and daye bodye & ſoule / and
put them to the deth for his loue.
And they alſo that fede mannes ſoule
with brede of goddes worde. And ſyth
they ſhalbe dampned that wyll not gyue
to the poore folke mete & drynke for
goddes ſake / mochemore ſholde they bedāpned
y• robbe men of theyr lyfe & lyuelode
/ & they y• done lecherye / auoutry
manſlaughter / robbery / and other horryble

ſynnes. And on the ſame maner
whan Cryſte ſpecyfyed to that riche
man / the cōmaūdementes of the ſeconde
table / and the ſeconde cōmaundemente
ef charyte. He ſheweth that ſythen
tho were ſo neceſſarye to haue the
lyfe withouten ende. Moche more the
cōmaūdementes of the fyrſt table and
the fyrſte cōmaundemente of charyte
ben neceſſarye to alle that wyll haue
y• lyfe withouten ende. ¶Diues. Therfore
wolde I fayne kepe theym better
thanne I haue done / but I ſee many
doubtes therin that I can not kepe
theym. ¶Pauper. What doubte haſte
thou therin.
            
         
         
            ¶Here begynneth the fyrſte cōmaundemente.
            
               
                  Caplm Primū.
               DIues. In the fyrſte cō
                  maundement
as I haue
lerned / god ſayth
thus. Thou ſhalte haue
none other ſtraunge
goddes byfore me.
Thou ſhalte make to the noo grauen
thynge / noo mawmette / noo lykeneſſe
that is in heuen aboue / ne that is bynethe
in erthe / ne of ony thynge that
is in the water vnder therthe. Thou
ſhalt not worſhyppe theym with thy
bodye outwarde / ne within thyn herte
inwarde. Exodi .xx.c. Soo by this me
thynketh that god forbedeth makyng
of ymages and worſhyppyng of them
and yet men doo make ymages theſe
dayes grete plente / bothe in the chirche
and without the chirche. And all men
as me thynke worſhyp ymages. And
it is full harde to me but I do in that
as all men done. And yf I worſhyppe
theym me thynketh I do ydolatrye ayenſte
goddes lawe. ¶Pauper. God
forbedeth not men to make ymages / For
he bad Moyſes make ymages of
two aungellys that be called cherubyn
in the lykeneſſe of two yonge men / as
we fynde Exodi .xxxvij.c. ¶And Salomon
made ſuche and many mother
to in the Temple to the worſhyppe of
god / the thyrde boke of kynges .vij.c.
And god bad Moyſes make his tabernacle
& al that longeth therto after ſhe
enſample and the lykeneſſe that was
ſhewed to hym vpon the hylle / whan
he was there with god .xl. dayes and
xl. nyghtes. Exodi .xxv. And therfore
god forbedeth not vtterly the makynge
of ymages / but he forbedeth vtterly
for to make ymages for to worſhyppe
them as goddes / & to ſette theyr fayth
theyr truſte / theyr hope / theyr loue / and
theyr byleue in them. For god wyll haue
mannes herte hole knytte to hym
allone / for in hym is al our helpe & all
our ſaluacōn. And therfore we muſte
worſhyppe hym & loue hym / and truſte
in hym aboue all thynge / & nothynge
worſhyppe but hym or for hym. That
all the worſhyp that we do to ony creature
be do pryncypaly for hȳ & arrected
to hym. For he ſayth. Gloriam meamalteri
non dabo / et laudem meam
ſculptilibus. Yſaye .xlij. I ſhall not
gyue my worſhyppe / my blyſſe / my
glorye to none other / ne my prayſynge
to grauen ymages / neyther to paynted
ymages. And in the ſame chapytre
he ſayth Shamfully ſhente myght

they be all that ſette theyr truſte in to
grauen ymages. ¶Diues. wherof ſerue
the ymages. I wolde they were brente
all. ¶Pauper. They ſerue for thre
thynges. For they be ordeyned to ſtere
mannes mynde to thynke on Cryſtus
Incarnacyon / and on his paſſyon / and
on his lyuynge / and on other ſayntes
lyuyng. Alſo they ben ordeyned to ſtyre
mannes affeccyon / and his herte to
deuocyon. For ofte a man is more ſtered
by ſyght than by heryng or redynge.
Alſo they be ordeyned to be a token
and a booke to the lewde people / that
they may rede in ymagerye and paynture
/ that clerkes rede in the booke as
the lawe ſayth. De cōſecra. diſtinct .iij.

deſtroyed ymages as thou woldeſte
doo / and forfended that no man
ſholde worſhyp ymages. He was accuſed
to the pope ſaynt Gregorye whiche
blamed hym gretely for that he had ſo
deſtroyed the ymages / but vtterly he
prayſed hym for he forfended them to
worſhyppe ymages.

               DIues. How ſholde I rede in

¶Pauper. whan yu ſeeſt

y• deyed on y• croſſe for thy ſynne & thy

¶Right ſo Cryſte in holy wryte oftymes

Somtyme we ſpeke of the croſſe only

is to ſaxe dyuyne ſeruyce and dyuyne

to god. An other is a ſeruyce & a worſhyp
comon to god & to creatures reſonable

called Dulia in latyn. The fyrſte ſeruyce

who ſoo doth ony dyuyne ſeruyce
that is called Latria. to ony creature
to ony ymage or to ony fourme or fygure

in latyn is called a fourme and an

who ſoo doth dyuyne worſhypp that

Reddes domino iuramenta tua
Thou ſhalt yelde thyn othes to thy
lorde god & to no creature. Alſo it is
done by vowes makyng / for it is not
lawfull to make auowe to ony creature.
And therfore he ſayth. Reddes

thyn auowes to thy lorde god / and to
no creature. And the prophete ſayth.
Vouete et reddite domino deo veſtro.
Make ye vowes / and yelde ye your
vowes to your lorde god / and not to
the ymages ſtockes ne ſtones Alſo it
is done with prayer and prayſyng of

and prayſe hym as ſouerayne myght
ſouerayne wyſdome / ſouerayne goodneſſe
/ ſouerayne trouth / as all rightfull
and mercyfull / as ſhaper and ſauer
of all thyng / and lorde of all and
ſouerayne helpe in euery nede. And in
this maner may we not praye ne prayſe

of holy chirche / or ony ſuche

ſpeke to the ymage they do open ydolatrye.
And they be not excuſed all yf

For theyr ſyght and theyr other wyttes

               ALſo this proteſtacōn & knowlechynge

For what man offreth or maketh ſacrefyce
/ he knowlecheth hym gyuer of

tokens of the bodye / as by knelynge / bowyng / lyftyng

we knowlege that we may not ſtande
in vertue / in goodneſſe / ne in wele
but oonly by hym. Whan we falle al
downe to the groūde to god / we knowlege
that but he helde vs & kepte vs
we ſholde falle all to nought / & whan
we holde vp our handes to hym / we
knowleche that we may right noughte
do without hym / & that we be alle

in his power / and that he may doo
without vs what he wyll / and ſo we
put vs only in his grace. Alſo by that
we knowleche that all that we haue
of ony goodneſſe / we take it of his
honde & of his gyfte. Whan we bunche
our breſtes / we knowleche vs gylty
ayenſt hym in herte and in dede.
And that we haue done moche ſynne
whiche oonly god knoweth. For
oonly he knoweth mannes herte and
mannes wyll. Alſo we bunche our ſelfe
on the breſte in token of ſorowe of
herte for our myſdedes / and that we
repente vs ſore of our myſdedes. Theſe
tokens of reuerence be done alſo to
reſonable creatures / as to the angell / man
and woman / but not in this maner.
For whan we knele or bowe vs / or
falle downe to the groūde / or holde
vp our hondes to ony creature / we
knowleche that ther is ſome ſoueraynte
& ſome vertue in hym that we knele
to / wherby he may helpe vs / not
as pryncypall helper / but as ſecondarye
with the helpe of god. And therfore
theſe dedes of worſhyp and reuerence
ſholde not be done to ymages / ſtockes / or
ſtones / ne to none ſuche other.
For they haue none ſuche vertue
ne ſoueraynte aboue man ne woman
nother right nought may helpe them
at theyr nede / neyther them ſelfe alſo
So that theſe dedes of reuerence pryncypally
ought to be done to god / ſecō
                  darye
to angell man or woman / but
in noo wyſe to none other vnreſonable
creatures / ne to none ſuche ymages.
And as ſayth a grete clerke doctor
Halis in ſūma ſua. To god men
ſholde knele with bothe the knees / in
token that in hym is all our pryncypale
helpe / but to man oonly with the
one knee. Soo my frende ye ſhall vnderſtande
that the worſhypp whiche
is called Latria. ſhall be done oonly
to god. The worſhypp that is called
Dulia. is comon both to god & man
For we ſholde worſhyp man woman
and angell / not for theym ſelfe / but
pryncypally for god / for that they ben
made to goddes ymage / for they ben
goddes ſeruaūtes and goddes mynyſtres.
For ther is no lorde / ne tyraunt / ne
prelate / man nor woman ſo wycked
/ but that he ſerued god in ſome
thynge. And alſo though he be now
wycked / we wote not how ſoone that
he ſhall amende hym & be onr broder

Auſtyn ſayth vpon the ſaultre. But
to the fende ſholde we doo noo worſhyppe

               WE ſholde worſhyp man and
womā / for he is made to the
lykeneſſe of god / for his offyce
/ for the worſhyppe of god / and deſpyſe
his ſynne. And therfore Saynt
Peter ſayth. Omnes honorate. Worſhyppe
ye all men and wymen. Honore
inuicem preuenientes. Be ye beſy / who
ſoo may euery man worſhyppe

why men be ſo beſy to do the people
worſhyp or ymages. ¶Pauper.
Couetyſe of men of holy chirche and

lewdeneſſe both of theym and of the
people ben cauſe of ſuche ydolatrye.
¶Diues. I haue herde ſaye that many
grete clerkes holden therwith / &
ſaye that men ſholde worſhyp ymages.
¶Pauper. Worſhypp is a large
worde & comon to dyuyne worſhypp
and ſeruyce that is called Latria. and
to worſhyppe that is called Dulia.
whiche longeth proprely to ſpeke only
to reſonable creatures. For as ſayth
the phyloſophre quarto Ethicorum.
Worſhyppe is mede of vertue / and
it ought not for to be done to ony creature
/ but that the creature haue ſome
goodneſſe of vertue morall / & of grace
/ or ellys ſome offyce to lede and to
brynge folke to morall vertue. ¶Diues.
Than to the ymage ſtocke or ſtone
/ golde or ſyluer / longeth none ſuche
worſhyppe. For whan that it is ſo ſere
& ſo drye and worme eten / it hath
noo vertue att all / but for to brenne
ſooner in the fyre than a grene tree.
But whan that it wext vpon the erthe
/ it had bertue to wexe and ſprynge
and to brynge forth grene leues &
floures to conforte of mānes eye and
fruyt to helpe of man & beeſt. And yet
wyll noo man worſhypp ſuche grene
trees ne precyous ſtones ne herbys all
yf they haue grete vertues and wonderfull
/ for they haue noo vertue morall.
Moche more men ſholde not worſhyppe

                  e drye & worme eten trees / that
haue noo vertue atte all. Saye

worſhypp is called veneracōn that
ſtandeth in honeſt & ſyker kepyng / honeſte
handelynge / clene dyghtyng / in
ſtandyng / in ſyttynge / in place ſettynge.
And this maner of worſhypp may
be done and ought to be done to euery
holy thynge that longeth to god &
to holy chirche / as booke chalyce veſtyment
belles and ymages / in as moche
as the be ournaments of holy
chirche / and the lewde mennes booke
But this worſhyppe and veneracyon
is no ſeruyce ne ſubgeccyon of hym yt
doth it to thyng yt he doth it to / but it
ſheweth ſubgeccyon & ſeruyce of the
thynges ſoo worſhypped to hym that
putteth it ſo in worſhyppe / ſo kepeth
it and ſo ſaued it. And in this maner
the lawe called ymages venerable &
worſhypfull / for ther ſholde no man
deſpyſe them ne defoule them / brenne
them ne breke them. De conſecracōe.
diſ. iij. Venerabiles. And for this maner
of veneracōn and worſhyp ſayth
the lawe in the ſame place / and ſome
doctours / that ymages booke or veſtymente
and chalyce may be worſhypped
with Dulia. But they take that
Dulia full largely / and full vnproprely.
For ſuche worſhyppe and veneracyon
is no ſeruyce ne ſubgeccyon as
I ſayd byfore. And proprely to ſpeke
Dulia is a worſhyp that longeth only
to god and to reſonable creatures.
And pryncypally and excellently to
our lady ſaynt Mary / & to the manhode
of Cryſte / whiche worſhyppe is
called Yꝑdulia. proprely ſayd. Alſo to
the croſſe that Cryſte deyed vpon / yf
that men hadde it as clerkes ſaye longeth
Yperdulia. For all thynges that
lacked lyfe / the croſſe of Cryſte ought
mooſt to be worſhyped / & be in mooſt

veneracōn & reuerence. But that veneracyon
is called yꝑdulia. vnproprely.
Alſo frendes ther is worſhyp that the
ſubgette doth to his ſouerayne / know
lechyng hym his ſouerayne by worde
or by token / as by knelyng bowynge
& ſuche other / & this maner worſhyp
is called proprely adoracyon. Other
worſhyp yt is called honoracōn / & veneracōn
is cōuenyent bothe to the ſouerayne
& to the ſubgette. For a lorde
honoureth his ſeruaunt by gyftes / by
promocōns in offyce & dygnyte. Alſo
a lord worſhypeth a poore man whā
he ſetteth hȳ at his owne table / or aboue
other that ben of hygher degree
than he / & yet he adoureth hym not / ne
doth hym ye worſhyp of adoracōn
Natheleſſe adoracōn is taken ſomtyme
full vnproprely for comon honoracōn
& veneracōn. And for as moche
as all theſe maners of worſhyp ſo dyuerſe
ben called wt one name of worſhyp
in Englyſſhe tonge / & ofte y• latyn
of worſhyp is taken & vſed vnproprely
& to comonly / therfore men fall
in moche doubte & errour in redyng &
not well vnderſtande what they rede.

               DIues. This dyſtynccōn & declaracōn
of worſhypyng how
it is taken & vſed in dyuerſe
maner / & how it is called wt one name
in Englyſſhe / hath auoyded many
argumentes & reaſons whiche I
thought to haue made ayenſt the. I
am out of doubte. I can anſwere ther
to my ſelfe by thy declaracyon. But
two thynges as me thynketh yu ſaydeſt
not all trouth. ¶Pauper. Whiche be
tho. ¶Diues. Thou ſaydeſt that
men ſholde not offre but only to god
ne knele on bothe knees but oonly to
god. And we ſee att our eye that men
offre to the preeſt in the chirche & knele
on both knees to the preeſt in ſhryfte.
¶Pauper. Men offre not the preſt
but oonly to god as I ſayd fyrſte by
the hondes of the preeſt / for the preeſt
is goddes mynyſtre ordeyned to reſceyue
thynges that ben offred to god
as tythes & deuocyons & lyue therby
honeſtly & to ſpende the remenaūt to
nedy folke & to worſhyp of god & the
helpe of holy chirche. Ne men knele
not in that maner to the preeſt / but
to god byfore the preeſt for the reuerence
of god & of the ſacramentes of
holy chirche. But whan man kneled
to temporall lordes prelates or preſtes
or ony other perſone / for reuerence of
his perſone or of his dygnyte / he ſholde
knele oonly with that one knee.
But as ſayth Saynt Auſtyn de ciuitate
dei libro decimo capitulo quinto.
By flaterye and ouerloweneſſe of the
people and ambycyon of the ſoueraynes
many worſhyppes that longeth
ſomtyme to god allone / ben now vſed
in the worſhyppynge of ſynfull man
and woman. And though it be alſo

of god as I ſayd fyrſte / it is
ſuffrable and ſuffycyent.

And ſo as me thynketh they do ydolatrye.
¶Pauper. In euery lawe thuryfycacōn

hygh dyuyne worſhyp that ought not
to be done to ony creature by waye of
offrynge. Neuertheleſſe it may be done
in two maners. Fyrſte by waye of
offrynge with conuenyent betokenynge
/ & ſo it may be done to ony creature.
For in this maner it oweth not to
be done but oonly of a preeſt & at an
aultre halowed or with a ſuperaltare
halowed / ſoo that preſtes lefully may
ſaye there theyr maſſe. For by the encenſour
is vnderſtande mannes herte

thuryfycacyon betokeneth that right
as the preeſt offreth vp in the encenſour
encenſe / ſwete ſmellynge by hete
of the fyre. So the preeſt & the people
by the preeſt offren vp her hertes to
god and her prayers quyckned by the
fyre of charyte. And praye that theyr
bedes and theyr prayers and deuocyons
may be pleaſaūt to hym for that
endeleſſe charyte that he ſhewed to

therfore oonly a preeſte ſholde encenſe

And ſoo it may be done to the

that as the encenſe by hete of the fyre

but yf the preeſte and the people ben

pleaſeth not god / neyther gooth not
vp to god as it ſholde ellys doo / and
therfore is noo man worthy for to be
encenſed but yf he be in charyte. And
whan the clergye in the quere or the
people is encenſed / they ſholde bowe
them lowe for the reuerence of god / &
take it not as for worſhyp done to hȳ
but as ſterynge to deuocōn / & as a token
what deuocōn they ſholde ſhe we
to god / & by bowynge them ſhewe loweneſſe
of deuocōn yt it ſtereth them
to. For without deuocōn and lowneſſe
of herte our prayers gone not vp
to god. But as ſayth the wyſe man.
The prayer of hȳ that loweth hȳ in
his prayer thyrleth the clowdes. The

myſſalle & the goſpell is encenſed in
token that the prayers wryten therin
prouffyte lytyll or nought / but yf they
be made with deuocyon & in charyte
And ther ſholde noo man preche the
goſpell / but with deuocyon and for
charyte / and all his ſpede and all his
prouffyte referre vp to god / and all
his prayers put in his wyll. Atte buryeng
of people men encenſe the deed
bodyes / in token yt he deyed in charyte
/ & in his deyeng he had his herte vp
to god / by hope fayth charyte & deuocōn
/ for ellys he is not worthy to be
buryed in cryſten buryelles. Alſo in token
that he ſhall quycken ayen & ryſe
vp from deth to lyfe atte daye of dome
& go vp to heuen for his charyte
whiche he had by his lyfe as the encenſe
ſtyed vp by the hete of the fyre / And
for the ſame cauſe is the graue
encenſed / in token that he ſhall awake
& ryſe from deth to lyfe. Alſo the
bodye & the graue ben encenſed / in token
yt it is pleaſaūt to god yt holy chirche
prayed for hym. But this maner
of encenſynge done to the clergye to
the people to the deed bodyes & to the
graue ſholde be done with encenſe not
halowed ne blyſſed / for it is none offrynge.
And as touchynge encenſynge
/ done in the preſence of ymages / as
it ſemeth to me it is not done proprely
to the ymages / but byfore the
ymages in dyuerſe ſygnyfycacyons
or tokenynges. For whan encenſyng
is done byfore a paynted ymage yt repreſenteth
Cryſte whiche is very god
& man. It ſemeth to me y• the encenſynge
ſygnefyed yt all deuocōn & charytable
prayer whiche is bitokened by
encenſe / ſholde pryncypally ſtye vp to
god / & whan encenſyng is done byfore
ony ymage of our lady or of other
ſayntes / it may ſygnefye yt the prayers
of ſayntes whiche praye for vs
wretches in erthe ſtye vp by theyr grete
charyte vnto the mayeſte of god.
¶Diues. Syth encenſyng is not done
to the people by waye of worſhyppyng
/ why encenſe they fyrſte the ſoueraynes
more thanne the ſubgettes.
¶Pauper. For in all thyng muſte be

ouer all it is lewfull and medefull to

Cryſte for vs henge vpon y• tree / & for

to haue an eye to his paſſyon / & worſhyp
hym that deyed for vs all vpon

the Iewes in maner of worſhyppyng
For atte goddes ordenaūce they worſhyped

in theyr cerymonyes ſholde ſoone paſſe

for ony worſhypp or prayſynge or for

go downe to helle / tyll the newe lawe
came whan Cryſte deyed for vs alle.
And for the ſame reaſon Cryſt deyed
weſtwarde / and in his deyeng ſayd.
Conſūmatum eſt. That is to ſaye. It
is ended. For in his deth the olde teſtamente
ended & wente downe as the
ſonne / and the daye gooth downe in
the weſte. And therfore we cryſten people
worſhyp in to the eeſt / by techyng
of the holy ghooſt / in token that our
lawe ſhall ſprynge and ſprede as the
daye comynge as the ſonne ryſeth &
ſpryngeth out of the ceſt / and as all

all they begynne to waxe dymme &

me and full derke. But the newe lawe
is open bryght and clere. Alſo we
worſhyp Cryſte mooſt in the eeſt / for
he was mooſt deſpyſed in the Eeſt / whan
he on a good frydaye henge on
the croſſe tourned in to y• weſte / whan
the Iewes ſtode byfore hym & paſſed
byfore hym with many ſcornes & deſpytouſe

was mooſt deſpyſed in the eeſt of the

cryſten people worſhyppe hym mooſt

mooſt deſpyſed for vs on y• good frydaye

on the good frydaye. And in this maner
as moche as we may / we tourne
all his deſpyte in to worſhyp of hym
Alſo we worſhyp god in y• eeſt in tokē

ſo we byleue that Cryſt roſe vp from

in token that we longe to come ayen
to the blyſſe of paradyſe yt we loſte in

Theſe reaſons ben good. But why
were than the .xxv. men blamed of

they worſhypped god eeſtwarde. For

Yf they do ſo they do well / but I drede
they do not all ſo. And as ſayth a

For the people is ful moche enclyned

                  Caplm .xvij.
               DIues. That is ſoth. For theſe
dayes men doo worſhyp to
the ſonne / mone / & ſterres / y•
for to worſhyp the ſterres & the planetes
/ & the crafte of aſtronomye / they
wyll putte out god of his mayſterye / out
of his kyngdom & his lordſhyp / and
out of his fredom / & make hym
more boūde to ſterres / than euer was
ony kynge or ony lorde / or ony man
vpon erthe. They wyll be of goddes
pryue coūſeyll wyll god or not / and
rule his domes / his dedes / his werkes
& all by theyr wyttes & by the courſe
of the planetes / in ſomoche yt as they
ſaye ther ſhall no man ne woman be
hole ne ſeke / foule ne fayre / riche ne
poore / wyſe ne foole / good ne wycked / but
by the werkyng of the bodyes aboue
& by theyr wyttes ſoo that they
can telle it afore. Ther ſhall falle no
myſchyef ne welthe neyther to perſone
ne to comunyte / but by her wyttes
& by y• courſe of planetes. None hungre
morayne ne tempeſte / no ſekeneſſe
/ 
                     •
                  oo warre ſhall falle but by theyr
wyttes & by the werkynge of the bodyes
aboue. For as they ſaye / the bodyes
aboue rule all thyng here bynethe.
And thus they wyl make god more
thralle & of leſſe power than ony
kyng or lord vpon erthe. For why our
lyege lorde the kyng god ſaue his lyf
hath power & fredom of a page for
to make a yoman / of a yoman a gentylman
/ of a gentylman a knyght / of
a poore man a grete lorde without leue
or helpe of the planetes. And yf a
man treſpaſſe ayenſt hym & be taken
with treaſone / he is of power to doo
hym to be hanged & drawen / & to take
from hym & his heyres the herytage
& make hym full poore. And he is
of power to make his true lyegeman
riche though he be right poore. This
fredom & this powir hath our lyege
lorde our kyng / where ſoo the planetes
ben / or in what ſygne / in what reſpecte
/ or in what conſtellacōn or coniunccyon
/ our kyng may doo all this
& axe the planetes no leue / they may
not lette hym / ne all the aſtronomers
with all theyr calculacōn though they
watche & ſtare after the ſterres / tylle
they leſe theyr hedes may not let hȳ / ne
ſaue oo mānes lyfe that the kyng
wyll haue deed. Moche more than the
kyng of heuen yt made ſonne & mone
& ſterres & all thyng of nought & ruleth
gydeth & weldeth al thyng at his
wyll may make riche & poore / fayre
& foule / hole & ſeke / wyſe & foole / good
or wycked whom he lyketh without
ony helpe of the planetes. And yf ony
perſone or comunyte treſpaſſe ayenſt
hym / he may chaſtyſe hym by hungre

by moreyne / by ſekeneſſe / by tempeſt / by
ſwerde / by pouerte / by loſſe of catel
& what wyſe he wyll / and he may rewarde
his true ſeruaūtes as hȳ lykith

               PAuper. As we fynde in holy
wryte. Gen̄. i.c. At the begȳ
                  nyng
of ye worlde whan god
made all thyng of nought / the fourth
daye he made ſonne & mone & ſterres
& ſette them in ye fyrmament to gyue
lyght to the creatures here byneth / yt
the ſonne pryncypally ſholde ſhyne &
gyue lyght by daye / mone & ſterres by
nyght More ouer as ſayth ye boke he
made them & ordeyned them for to
parte the daye from ye nyght / & they
ſholde be in tokenes & tymes dayes &
yeres / yt by the tokens of y• bodyes aboue
men ſholde knowe y• daye from ye
nyght / & one daye from an other / &
wyte what daye it were & what tyme
of y• daye / what nyght & what tyme
of the nyght / what yere & what tyme
of y• yere / what moneth & what tyme
of the moneth. Alſo god ordeyned thē
& made them yt by the tokens & by y•
bodyes aboue men ſholde knowe whā
it were tyme to ſlepe & tyme to wake
tyme to trauayle & tyme to reſte / tyme
to halowe & tyme to labour / tyme
to ete & tyme to faſte / tyme to ſette &
tyme to ſowe / tyme to ere tyme to repe
& to mowe. And therfore Salomō
ſayth Ecclïaſtes .iij. That all thyng
hath his tyme. & all thyng vnder heuen
paſſeth awaye by ſpace of tyme.
And ſo god made the fyrmament aboue
with bryght bodyes yt ben therin
to ſerue mankynde / & other creatures
alſo of lyght & tyme. Of lyght as a
lanterne that may not be quenched.
Of tyme as an orloge that may not
fayle. God made hem to ſerue man
and not man to ſerue them. He made
them for man / & not man for them.
He made them not to gouerne mam / but
he gaaf man & woman wytte &
dyſcrecōn to gouerne them ſelfe with
his grace by the lyght and wyſſynge
of tyme / whiche he hath of the bodyes
aboue / that by theyr lyght they
may ſee to werke / and by theyr ſtyrynge
and by theyr courſe they may
wyte whan it is tyme for to werke.
And therfore ſayth the lawe .xxvi. q̄.
quinto. Non licet in gloſa. That the
bodyes aboue ben tokens & not cauſes
of thynges here byneth. And as a
lampe or an orloge ben neceſſarye to
relygyouſes by nyght where by they
may ryſe and rule them ſelfe in goddes
ſeruyce / ſo ſerue the bodyes aboue
to mankynde / that we may haue of
them bodely lyght / and by theyr mouynge
knowe our tyme for to ſerue
our god eche man & woman in his degree.
And as the lampe & ye orloge in
the dortour rule not the relygyouſes / but
the relygyouſes rule them by the
lampe & by the orloge / & in cytees &
townes men rule them by the clocke / &
yet proprely to ſpeke / the clocke ruleth
not them / but a man ruleth the
clocke. Right ſo man & woman / beeſt
& byrdes & other creatures rule them

ſelfe by the bodyes aboue / & the bodyes
aboue rule not theym. And therfor
they ſholde not be called gouernours
of this worlde / for they gouerne not
this worlde / they be nought ellys but
Inſtrumentes of goddes gouernaūce
For it fareth by god & the bodyes aboue
/ as it doth by the ſmyth & his grȳ
                  dynge
ſtone / by the wryght & his axe
by the orloger & his orloge▪ ¶Diues.
I praye y• ſhewe me well this. ¶Pauper.
Thou ſeeſt atte thyn eye yt whan
the ſmyth gryndeth a knyfe or an are
or a ſwerde on his ſtone / ye ſtone doth
nought but gooth about in one courſe.
And as the ſmyth that ſytteth aboue
wyll dyſpoſe & holde / ſo gryndeth
the ſtone. Yf he wyll grynde ſharpe it
ſhall grynde ſharpe / yf he wyll grynde
blunte and playne / it ſhall grynde
blunte & playne / right as he wyll yt it
grynde / ſo it gryndeth. Yf he take awaye
the knyfe axe or ſwerde / the ſtone
gryndeth right nought / and yet it
gooth about the ſame courſe as it dyde
byfore. Right ſo it is of god & the
bodyes aboue. For the planetes & the
bodyes aboue gone alwaye about in
one courſe certayne / in whiche god or
deyned theym at y• begynnyng of the
worlde / whiche courſe they ſhall kepe
vnto the dome. And as god wyll that
they worche / ſoo ſhall they werke / yf
god wyll that they grynde ſharpe / &
cauſe mo reyne / ſekenes / & tempeſtes
hungre & warre / & ſuche other they
ſhall do ſo / yf he wyll that they grynde
playne & ſmothe & cauſe helthe of
bodye / fayre weder & holſome / plente
of corne & vytayles / peas & reſte / they
ſhall doo ſo. Right as god wyll what
that they worche ſo they ſhall werke.
So that god may do with the planetes
what he wyll / & he may do without
the planetes what he wyll. In
what ſygne / in what conſtellacōn / coniunccōn
/ or reſpecte that they be / they
be alwaye redy to fulfyll the wyll of
god.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .xix.
               DIues. Sythen god may doo
with the bodyes aboue what
he wyll & whan he wyll / and
ſythen god is ſo free in his doynge / &
not arted by the planetes ne by none
other creature / how ſholde ony man
knowe goddes domes by the courſe
of y• planetes / or deme therby / or telle
what god wyll do in tyme comynge / or
dyuyne of thynges that be to come
¶Pauper. Thou mayſt not knowe
by the axe what the wryght wyll worche
ne whan. Ne thou mayſt not knowe
by the orloge what tyme the orloger
wyll ſett it ne knowe the orlogers
wyll. Ne thou mayſt not knowe by
the gryndſtone what the ſmyth wyll
grynde / ne what maner / ne whan.
¶Diues. It is ſoth ¶Pauper. No
more maye we knowe by the bodyes
aboue / ne by the courſe of the planet
                     •
                  
what god wyll doo / ne what he wyll
ordeyne of man or of woman / or of
ony comunyte / londe / royalme / contre
or cyte / for the planetes & the bodyes
aboue be nought ellys but goddes Inſtrumentes
/ & the courſe of the planetes
is not chaungeable ne varyable / but
it is putte in certayne meouynge

and ſteryng whiche they may not fleene
chaunge / for they haue no free eleccyon
in theyr doynge. But god is ſouerayne
Iuge / mooſt rightfull / mooſt
mercyfull / mooſt free to punyſſhe and
to ſpare. For he is mooſt of myght / and
no thynge may hym withſtande
and therfore his domes and his werkes
be not neded ne arted by the planetes
/ but after yt men chaūge theyr
lyuynge ſo chaūgeth he his domes to
punyſſhe or ſpare / to wele or to wo / to
heuen or to helle. He demed the ſynful
cyte of Nynyue bycauſe of ſynne to
be deſtroyed within .xl. dayes / but
whan they repented theym & amended
theym & cryed after mercye / he
chaūged his dome & ſpared the cyte / &
deſtroyed it not as telleth Ionas
the prophete / & yet the planetes chaū
                  ged
not her courſe for none amendement
of the people. Alſo we fynde in
holy wryte the .iiij. boke of the kynges
that god ſende the ꝓphete Yſaye
to the kyng Ezechie whan he hadde
ſynned & badde hym made his teſtamente
for he ſholde deye & no lenger
lyue. Anone the kyng repented hym
& wepte full ſore & axed mercy. And
anone god badde the prophete Yſaye
that yet was in the kynges halle to
go ayen to the kyng & ſaye to hym yt
god had accepted the repentaūce and
herde his prayer / & that he ſholde not
deye than / but he ſholde lyue .xv. yere
lenger. Loo my frende how ſoone the
dome of god was chaūged all to mercy.
And though the planetes yet that
tyme kepte forth theyr courſe / they
chaunged not for all the kynges wepynge.
¶Diues. Anone after the ſonne
chaūged his courſe & tourned ayen
in to the eeſt and began a newe daye.
¶Pauper. The tournynge ayen of
the ſonne was not cauſe of the mercy
of god / ne of chaūgyng of domes / for
god chaūged his dome byfore or the
ſonne tourned ayen. So the tournyng
ayen of the ſonne was not ellys but
a token of mercy to ye kyng Ezechie
& to all ſynfull wretches that wolde
amende them. For right as the ſonne
chaūged his courſe after y• repentaū
                  ce
of the kyng. Right ſo god chaūged
his ſentence anone as man or womā
repenteth hym of his ſynne and is in
wyll to amende hym Therfore ſayth
the lawe De penitē. di.i. ſufficiat. Nouit
deus mutare ſentenciā. ſi tu noueris
emendare delictū. God can chaū
                  ge
his ſentence & his dome anone as
y• canſte amende thy treſpaſſe. Alſo it
was a token to the kyng that goddes
byheſt to him ſholde be fulfylled. But
all the aſtronomers yt euer were coude
not tell byfore of yt wonderfull token
of the ſonne / for it was all ayenſt the
comon courſe of kynde / & that & ſuche
other ſhewe well that god is not ruled
by the courſe of the planetes / but that
god ruled the planetes & not the planetes
hym / ne his domes ne his werkes.
But god ruleth demeth & gouerneth
all mankynde perſone & comunyte
after that they deſerue / & as hȳ
thynketh mooſt ſpedefull to his worſhyppe
and to the comon prouffyte of
his Royalme in heuen in erthe and in
helle / whoos domes and ordenaūces
paſſe mannes wytte. And therfore

Saynt Poule ſayth. Quis cognouit
ſenſum dn̄i. aut quis conſiliarius eius
fuit. Who ſayth he hath knowen the
wytte of god / or who was his counſeyller.
Forſothe not the aſtronomers
neyther the wytches / for they ben fooles
of all fooles / and putte fertheſte
out of goddes counſeyll / as folke that
god mooſt hateth. Saynt Poule ſaythe
/ that domes of god ben incompre
henſyble / no man may knowe them
well / no man may trace his wayes.
Tho ben his wonderfull domes / they
ben ſo medled with mercy and rightfulneſſe
that they paſſe mannes wytte.
Therfore the prophete Dauyd
ſayth. Vniuerſe vie dn̄i miſericordia
et veritas. Alle the wayes of our lorde
ben mercy and trouth. Iudicia dn̄i
abiſſus multa. The domes of god be
of a grete depeneſſe / ye ſoo depe that
noo mannes wytte may ſeke to the
depeneſſe / ne knowe well the cauſe ne
the reaſon of his wonderfull domes.
And therfore ſuche aſtronomers and
wytches that entermeten theym ſoo
hyghe of goddes domes and wonder

thynges that ben to come and make
theym wyſe as yf they were goddes
felawes and knewe alle his preuy
counſeyll / they ben fooles of al fooles
¶Diues. Therfore clerkes ſaye that
they may noo thynge telle for certayne
/ but they may telle wherto man or
woman or comunyte is enclyned by
the werkynge of the bodyes aboue.
Neuertheleſſe as they ſaye / man and
woman may by vertue ouercome the
planetes / and ſoo euery wyſe man is
lorde and mayſter of the pla
                     ••
                  etes.
And therfore Tholomeus the grete
aſtronomer ſayth. Quod vir ſapiens
dominabitur aſtris.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .xx.
               ALſo as they ſay by aſtronomy
they may knowe whan men
ben enclyned to warre or to
peas. And whan by comon courſe of
kynde ſholde falle morayne / hongre / tempeſte / drought / and
ſuche other.
but as they ſaye one holy prayer may
chaunge euery dele. And thoughe it
falle not in one cōtree it falleth in an
other cōtree. ¶Pauper. Sythen they
can not telle for certayne what ſhall
befalle but all in doubte / & theyr ſawes
& theyr domes may ſoo lyghtly
be chaunged & brought to nought / it
is a grete foolye to ſette ony truſte to
theyr tales / for ſo may euery foole tell
what he wyll and excuſe euery leſynge.
This maner of ſpeche is nought
ellys but a mayntenyng of leſynges
and of faynnyng and of hydynge of

fayne be holden wyſe & nye of goddes

ferre they be fonden ſo falſe. Ye ſhall
vnderſtande my frende that ther is

all ayre in .xxiiij. houres / that is called
daye naturally / from ſonne ryſynge
to ſonne ryſyng / from none to none.
And ſythen they paſſen all londes
& all perſones ſo euenly / & make noo
more dwellynge ouer one londe than
ouer an other / why ſholde they more
enclyne one londe than an other / or
one perſone more than an other to vyce
or to vertue / to warre or to peas.
¶Diues. For ſome conſtellacyon or
ſome reſpecte in her paſſynge falleth
vpon one londe more than an other.
And as folke ben borne vnder dyuerſe
conſtellacōns or coniunccōns / dyuer
ſe reſpectes in dyuerſe ſygnes & vnder
dyuerſe planetes / ſo ben they enclyned
in dyuerſe maner & to dyuerſe thynges
/ vyce or vertue / warre or peas / helthe
or ſekeneſſe / pouerte or richeſſe / &
ſuche other. ¶Pauper. Whan the
kynges ſone is borne / in the ſame tyme
/ in the ſame conſtellacōn reſpecte
planete and ſygne / is the poore bonde
mannes ſone born / and yet haue they
not both one inclynacōn / ne one dyſpoſycōn.
For the kynges ſone is dyſpoſed
by his herytage to be kyng after
his fader. The poore bonde mannes
ſone is dyſpoſed by his byrthe to be a
bonde man all his lyfe as his faders
haue ben byfore hym hondred yeres / that
no planete myght auoyde theyr
bondage / ne fro the kynges theyr dygnyte.
In the ſame tyme & in the ſame
conſtellacōn & vnder the ſame planete
& ſygne that one childe is borne
ben many childern borne / & yet haue
they not all one inclynacōn ne one dyſpoſycōn.
For ſome of theym ben enclyned
to goodneſſe / & ſome to wyckedneſſe
/ ſome to ſekeneſſe & ſome to
helthe / ſome ben full angry & ſome
ben not ſo / ſome be wyſe ſome be fooles
/ ſome foule ſome fayre / ſome riche
ſome poore / ſome lyuyng longe & ſome
deye full ſoone. Ezau and Iacob
had both one fader and one moder.
Yſaac and Rebecca both were bygoten
at ones / as ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn / &
both borne attones / and yet were they
noo thynge lyke. For Iacob was a
good man Ezau a ſhrewe. Iacob
was loued of god Ezau was hated
for his wyckednes. Iacob was ſmoth
of bodye with lytyll here Ezau fulle
of here as a beeſt. Iacob was a true
ſymple man Ezau a rauenoure and
a malycyous ſhrewe. Iacob was peaſyble
Ezau a faytour or a baratour.
So thou myght well ſee that dyuerſe
inclynacōn of man & woman / ſtandeth
not in the planetes ne in the tyme
of the byrthe.

yet it is a comon ꝓuerbe / yonge ſaynt

And as a poete ſayth. Quod noua

Ieremy. Sampſon. Samuell & many

they that ben good & loue god in godeneſſe
in her youth they make a full

in ſynne & ben full veyne. God ſuffreth
theym to falle for a tyme / for
they ſholde ellys be to proude of theyr
goodneſſe / & haue dyſdayne of other
ſynfull wretches. Alſo ſomtyme one
is enclyned more to one ſynne than a
nother / for he was conceyued and begoten
in more ſynne than an other / al
yf he were begoten & born in wedlocke
/ for the man & the wyf may ſynne
togydre full greuouſly / eyther by myſ

yf they paſſe maner and meſute

holy tyme without drede or reuerence
of the tyme / ne wyll not ſpare for the

the axer and not in the yelder. Alſo
they may ſynne by wycked Intencyon
/ as yf they doo it for a wycked ende
/ or oonly to fulfyll the luſte of the
fleſſhe / not to flee fornycacyon / ne to
yelde the dethe of theyr bodye / ne to
brynge forth childern to the worſhyp
of god / but oonly taken hede of her
owne luſte. Alſo yf they coueyte childern
not to the worſhypp of god / but
for the worlde to be grete / & to make
theyr childern grete in this worlde. Alſo
men be enclyned to ſynne one more
than an other by exceſſe of mete and
drynke / by myſkepynge of his fyue
wyttes. And for this ſame cauſes one
is enclyned to bodely ſekeneſſe more
than an other. For ſynne oftyme is
cauſe of bodely ſekeneſſe. Alſo by mys
dyetynge of the moder whyle ſhe is
with childe / or by mys dyſpoſycyon of
the fader / or of the moder / or of both / whan
the childe is begoten / or by myſ
kepynge of the childe in the youthe.

For childern in youth wyl aſſaye and
handle well nyghe all thyng. And ſo
oftyme they ete & drynke and receyue
inwarde many vnthryfty thynges &
enuenym herſelf & hurte themſelf in

Alſo god ſmyteth them with ſekneſſe
of myſchyef. Somtyme for the faders

them riche and grete in this worlde.
Somtyme he ſmyteth them with ſekenes

as we fynde in y• goſpell of ſaynt Iohan

ſhewed in hym in gyuyng hym ſyght
Other cauſes ther ben ful many whiche
paſſen mannes wytte / for we may
not knowe all goddes domes. Ne theſe
cauſes here aſſygned be not alway
general. For ſōtyme a full good man
hath a full ſhrewed childe / ſome good
ſome bad. And ſomtyme a full wycked
man hath a full good childe. For
yf the childern folowed alway the fader
& the moder in goodeſſe or in wyckedneſſe
/ all the goodneſſe ſholde be
arected to the fader & to the moder / &
not to god. And they ſholde be proude
both fader / moder / & childe / & comyne
togydre fleſſhly to moche. And in the
ſame maner al the ſhrewedneſſe ſholde
be arected to the fader & moder all
yf it came on other behalf / & they ſholde
euer be ſory & falle in dyſpayre / &
not wyll yelde to them togydre the
dette of theyr bodye. And therfore
god medleth ſo one with an other / &
ſo modefyeth his domes that the gode
ſholde not preſume of hymſelfe ne
be to proude / but thanke god of all / ne
the wycked be to ſorye and ſo falle
in dyſpayre / but truſte in god that ſo
of the wycked maketh the good / & of

               DIues. They ſaye that as

and dyuerſe aſtates. Yf he be borne
vnder ſome ſygne they ſaye that he
ſhall be a fyſſher / and vnder ſome a
monyour / and vnder ſome a clerke / vnder
ſome a man of armes. ¶Pauper.
Many contrees knowe no mony
ours ne moneye neyther. And many
contrees ben ther that haue moneye / yet
they haue no monyours. For in a
full grete realme of .vi. hondred myle
in length / & .ij. hondred of brede be
no monyours but in one place aſſygned
by the kyng / not by the ſygnes ne
by the bodyes aboue. The kyng aſſygneth
bothe the place and theym that
ſhall make the moneye / not the bodyes
aboue. And yf ony dooth make
moneye but tho that y• kyng hath
ordeyned / he ſhall be ſlayne as a tray
toure / the ſygnes neyther the planetes
ſhall not ſaue his lyfe. And they that
be born nyghe the ſee / or nyghe ſome
grete water / gyue theym to fyſſhynge
and theyr childern alſo / not for the
ſynnes that they be born in / but for
the mooſt oportunyte of theyr lyuyng
whiche they haue by the water that

is ſo nyghe. They that ben borne fer
from the ſee gyue them to tylthe the

yf ther be plente of wulle. Some ben
ſhepeherdes / ſome monyours or moneye
quyners / ſome vynours / ſome of
other craftes as the contre axeth / not
after the ſygnes ne the bodyes aboue
Whan a man hath many childern he
putteth theym to dyuerſe craftes for
to gete theyr lyuynge. Men of armes
put theyr childern to armes. And comonly
euery man that can ought or
hath ought wherby he may lyue / he
putteth ſome of his childern in the ſame
degree to gete theyr lyuyng. And
thou mayſt well ſee that ſuche dyuer
ſyte in crafte or in lyuynge ſtandeth
more in the childes fader & his frendes
that ordeyned ſo for hym / than it
doth in the ſygnes or in the planetes.
For yf they ſholde abyde ye ordenaūce
of the planetes they ſholde deye for

nought ne ordeyne noo more for one
than for an other. ¶Diues. Syth ſuche
Inclynacyon ſtandeth lyryll or

deſtenye that men ſpeke ſo moche of.
And as they ſaye all thyng falleth to
man & woman by deſtenye.

God forbede ſayth he that ony
cryſten man or woman ſholde byleue
or ſaye that ther were ony deſtenye.
But god ſayth he that made mānes
lyfe of nought / he ruleth & gouerneth
mannes lyfe & womannes after that
they deſerue / and as his rightwyſneſſe
& his mercy axeth. And he ſayth that
man was not made for the ſterres / but
the ſterres were made for man.
¶Diues. The goſpell is ayenſt the.
For we fynde in the goſpell yt anone
as Cryſte was borne of the mayden / his
ſterre appered in the Eeſt / in token
that eche man & woman is born
vnder a certayne ſterre & vnder a certayne
conſtellacyon the whiche is called
his deſtenye / for all his lyuynge
after folowynge is gouerned therby / as
theſe aſtronomers ſayen. ¶Pauper.
For to mayntene folye they ſaye
many folye & ben not aſſhamed for
to lye. For that ſterre had no mayſtry
ne lordſhypp vpon that bleſſyd childe
But the childe was mayſtre & lorde
of that ſterre. The ſterre gouerned
not the childe / but the childe gouerned
the ſterre. The childe ſought not
that ſterre / but that ſterre ſought the
childe. The childe ſerued not the ſterre
/ but the ſterre ſerued y• childe / & dyde
hym full hyghe worſhyp & full wonderfull
ſeruyce / & therfore it was called
the childes ſterre / for ye childe was
lorde of the ſterre as he was of al the
other. For he was & is lorde of ſonne
mone & of all the ſterres & of all thynge
/ & they may not conferme theyr le
ſynges ne theyr falſe domes of aſtronomers
by that ſterre. For it was noo
planete ne ſterre of the fyrmamente / as
ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth & other doctors

of holy chirche / and reaſon and other
cauſes ſheweth it full well. ¶Diues.
How. ¶Pauper. For as theſe clerkes
tellen. Minima ſtella fixa maior eſt
tota terra. The leſte ſterre ſette faſte
in the fyrmamente is more than all
the erthe within the ſee & without the
ſee / & euery planete alſo is more than
all the erthe outake the mone & mercury
whiche be ſomdele leſſe than all
the erthe. And therfore ſomtyme they
leſe theyr lyght that they haue of the
ſonne by the ſhadowe & the vmbre of
the erthe whan it falleth right bytwene
the ſonne and theym. And yf that
ſterre had ben ſo moche or ony ſuche
ſterre it ſholde haue ouerwhelmed all
the erthe / for it wente full lowe nygh
the erthe to lede & to brynge the kynges
in theyr waye. Alſo the ſterres of
the fyrmament & the planetes folowe
the courſe of the fyrmament / & ryſe
vp in the eeſt & go downe in the weſte
euery daye naturelly. That ſterre dyde
not ſoo / for it was aboue the erthe
both nyght & daye & folowed not the
courſe of the fyrmament / but it helde
his courſe as the waye lede beſt in to
the cyte of Bethleem for to bryng the
kynges in theyr waye to the ſonne of
rightwyſneſſe that there rooſe out of
that clere fyrmament yemayden Marye
/ and as the ſonne from vnder the
erthe. Alſo the ſterres in the fyrmament
ſhynen by nyght & not by daye
That ſterre ſhone both nyght & daye
Alſo the ſterres of the fyrmament ſhewe themſelf to all men comonly both
poore & riche yonge & olde. That ſterre
appered not but to the thre kynges
& theyr companye. Alſo the ſterres of
the fyrmamente ben perpetuell & alwaye
laſtynge / that laſted but a lytyl
whyle twelue monethes atte mooſt
as ſome clerkes ſaye / & ſome ſaye but
xiiij. dayes or leſſe. ¶Diues. What
maner ſterre was it than. ¶Pauper.
Some clerkes tellen that is was an
angell in the lykeneſſe of a ſterre. For
the kynges hadde noo knowynge of
angellys / but toke all hede to the ſterre.
Some ſaye that it was the ſame
childe that laye in the oxe ſtalle whiche
appered to the kynges in the lykeneſſe
of a ſterre / and ſoo drewe theym
and ledde theym ſoo to hym ſelfe in
Bethleem. And therfore holy chirche
ſyngeth and ſayth. Iacebat in preſepio
et fulgebat in celo. He laye full
lowe in the cratche and he ſhone full
bryght aboue in heuen. But the comon
ſentence of the clerkes is that it
was a newe ſterre newely ordeyned
of god to ſhewe the byrthe of Cryſte.
And anone as it had done the offyce
that it was ordeyned for / it tourned
ayen to the mater that it come fro.

by the ſterre that ſuche a
childe was born / for that ſterre
coude not ſpeke to theym / ne telle
no ſuche tales. ¶Pauper. That is
ſothe / & therfore ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn
openly in a ſermon that the ſterre dyde
nought ellys by his apperyng but
brought theym in wonder and in grete
ſtudye for to knowe what it myghte

that her crafte ſerued them not / than
god ſhewed theym by Inſpyracōn inwarde
/ or ellys by an angell what it
betokened and badde theym folowe
the ſterre. And the ſame ſayth ſaynt
Iohan with the gylden mouthe vpon
Mathewe. They knewe well by
Balames prophecye that ſuche a childe
ſholde be born / but they knewe it
not by the crafte of aſtronomye / ne
myght knowe by theyr crafte / neyther
the tyme of his byrthe ne the place / as

Why ſayth than Saynt Auſtyn and

aſtronomye of childrens byrthe

byrthe ſythen they myght not by
that ſcyence knowe his byrthe .xxvi.

ſayth not that the crafte was lefull
or graunted to do / ne that it was lefull
to truſte therin / for it was alway
falſe and repreued of god and of phyloſophres
by ſkylle and reaſon. But
he ſayth that the ſcyence of the crafte
was lefull and graunted of god / not
the doyng yt by the ſcyence men myght
repreue the crafte / and the ſcyence alſo
/ and ſhewe by theyr owne pryncypalles
and groūdes that the crafte is
falſe / & that the ſcyence is no ſcyence
proprely to ſpeke / but open folye / as it
was well preued in Cryſtus byrthe.
And for it was ſo openly preued fals
in his byrthe / therfore after his byrthe
it is not lefull to vſe it ne to conne
it / but oonly to repreue the folye of
them yt vſe it. The doyng of the crafte
was vnlefull bothe byfore and after.
The ſcyence was ſuffred of god

make them ſelfe lyke aſmoche as

as they take to theym that lōgeth

whan ſuche thynges as they make

que ventura ſunt in futurum.et ſciemus

And in this maner they and all ſuche
treſpaſſen full hyghely ayenſt the fyrſte

cōmaundemente. For they maken
them lyke to god in heuen / and the
worſhypp that longeth oonly to god
they take it to theym ſelfe. Suche preſumpcōn
& pryde loſt angellys kynde

Yſaye .xiiij. Lucyfer ſayd in his herte
that he ſholde ſtye vp vnto heuen / &
ſette his ſeet aboue the ſterres / & ſytt

that he ſholde go vp aboue the hyght

them. For they ſette theyr wyttes &
theyr ſtudye and theyr fayth ſoo moche

god that is hygheſt. They wyll alſo
ſytte in the mount of the teſtamente

true / the teſtamente of goddes lawe
ſholde ſerue for nought / and ſoo goddes

ther is noman worthy to be punyſſhed

worthy to be rewarded for a good dede

And for that he dooth euyll whan he

But yf he were compelled by the bodyes

by his crafte tell me my thoughtes

How ſholde they knowe goddes coū

ſtandeth all in the wyll of god and

And therfore they may not knowe

But they may knowe by the bodyes

of wete / of tempeſte / froſte / ſnowe / wynde / thondre / &

ſo knoweth the ſhepeherde in the felde

               DIues. How may the bodyes
aboue be tokenes of ſuche
thynges & not cauſee. ¶Pauper.
Fallynge of ſoote in houſes is token
of rayne ſoone comynge / and yet
it is not the cauſe of the rayne / but
the rayne is cauſe of the ſote fallyng
For whan the ayer wereth moyſte / the
ſoote by moyſture of the ayer wexeth

heuy and falleth downe. And ſoo the
fallynge of the ſote is token of grete
moyſture in the ayre. Alſo ſwetynge
of water on the ſtoones is a token of
rayne / and yet it is not cauſe of the
rayne / but rayne and moyſture of the
ayre is cauſe of the water. Alſo meltyng
of ſalte whan it tourneth in to
water is token of rayne comyng / but
not the cauſe. Alſo ſmoke in houſes
whan it paſſeth not redely out is token
of rayne / for the ayre is ſo thycke
& heuy of moyſture that the ſmoke
may not ſtye vp ſoo redely as whan
the ayre is drye & clere Alſo the broughe
or cercle about the candell lyght
is token of rayne. And the blewe glowynge
of the fyre is a token of the
froſte / but not the cauſe. Theſe and
ſuche other ben tokenes of weder comynge
/ but not the cauſes. For they
ſhewe the dyſpoſycōn of the ayre whether
it is dyſpoſed to droughte or to
wete. And in the ſame maner the bodyes
aboue ben tokenes of weder comynge.
For by theyr lyght & maner
of ſhynynge they ſhewe the dyſpoſycōn
of the ayre wete or drye froſte or
ſnowe / thondre / lyghtnyng / wynde / &
ſuche other. And as the lyght in the
lanterne ſheweth dyſpoſycōn & colour
of the lanterne / & yet is not the lyght
cauſe of ſuche dyſpoſycōn ne of the colour
of the lanterne. And as the lyght
of the ſonne or mone ſheweth the dyſpoſycōn
of the glaſſe that it paſſith by
whether it be whyte or blake / blewe
or rede / yelowe or grene / & yet is not
the ſonne ne the mone cauſe of the colour.
Right ſo they ſhewe the dyſpoſycyon
of the ayre / and yet ben they not
alwaye cauſe of ſuche dyſpoſycyon.
And therfore the mone in one lunacyon
and in the ſame tyme ſheweth
in one contree grete tokenyng of rayne
/ & ſoo it falleth / and twenty myle
thens it ſheweth grete tokenynge of
drought and ſo it falleth / and yet is
it the ſame mone and the ſame lunacyon.
And therfore the cauſe of that
dyuerſyte is not in the mone / but in
the ayre. For the ayre in one contree
is dyſpoſed to rayne / and in the other
to drought. Alſo in one contree it ſheweth
wynde and tempeſte / and in another
contree not ſoo. Some contree
is full hote by ſhynynge of the ſonne
and ſome contree is not ſo hote. One
daye is full hote / and the next daye
after is full colde. The ſonne ſheweth
his lyght one tyme of the daye / and
an other tyme of the daye it ſheweth
not / whiche dyuerſyte ſtandeth
not in the ſonne / but in the ayre and
other cauſes. For the ſonne in hymſelfe
as the clerkes ſayen is alwaye atte
one and ſhyneth alwaye all lyke / it is
neyther hoter ne colder. But ſuche dyuerſyte
falleth by dyuerſyte of the ayre
/ and other dyuerſe meanes & cauſes
whiche paſſen mannes wytt. Some
tyme ſuche anenture & hongre / of morayne
/ of tempeſte / of drought / of wete
falleth by the ordenaunce of god
for mannes ſynne / or for to ſhewe his
myght and his worſhyppe. Somtyme
by werkynge of angellys good or
wycked att goddes byddynge. Some
tyme without meane oonly att his
wyll and his byddynge. Somtyme

by the werkynge of the bodyes aboue
atte his byddynge. For as I ſayd
fyrſte / he may doo with the planetes
what he wyll / and he may doo without
them what he wyll. And therfore
by the courſe of the planetes may we
not knowe ſuche aduentures as bycauſes
but as by tokens. For god made
theym for to be tokenes to man / beeſt / byrde / fyſſhe / and
other creatures
as I ſayd fyrſte. And therfore we
ſholde take hede to them oonly as to
tokenes & not to cauſes. Ne dyuyne
by hem as by cauſes / for we wote not
whan they ben cauſes of ſuche thynges
/ ne whan they be none.

               DIues. The mone as the derkes
ſayen is the cauſe of flowynge
and of the ebbynge of
the ſee / for it foloweth the courſe of
the mone. ¶Pauper. It may well
be ſo. But I wote well that the courſe
of the mone is a token whan that
the ſee ſhall ebbe and flowe / and the
ſee kepeth his tyme of ebbynge and
flowynge after the courſe and the tyme
of the mone in one contree ſooner
and in an other later. And yet euery
ſee doth not ſoo / but oonly one parte
of the weſte ſee that goth about Brytayne
and Irlonde / and other londes
nygh bycauſe of tho. But in other
ferre contrees / ne in the Grekes ſee
is no ſuche ebbynge ne flowynge. So
it ſemeth that ther be other cauſes of
that ebbyng and that flowyng than
the mone allone. But ſothe it is that
man and beeſt / byrde and fyſſhe / the
ſee and the ayre / tree and graſſe / and
all other creatures vſe and kepe theyr
doynge in kynde / and werken in tyme
that god hath ordeyned to theym
whiche tyme they knowe well by the
courſe of the ſonne mone and ſterres.
For as Salomon ſayth Eccleſiaſtes
.iij. Alle thyng hath his tyme ordeyned
of god by waye of kynde whiche
tyme they knowe & kepe by the courſe
of the bodyes aboue / whiche ben
tokenes to them ſhewynge what tyme
they ſholde doo theyr kynde that
they ben ordeyned to. And therfore
god ſayth by the prophete Ieremye.
viij. The puttoke in the ayre ſayth
he knoweth his tyme / the turtyll and
the ſwalowe kepe the tyme of her cō
                  myng.
But the people knowe not the
dome of our lorde god. For now a
dayes men take none hede to goddes
domes / but to the domes of aſtronomers
and to the courſe of the planetes.
The kynde of euery creature is
ordeyned by the dome of god / & what
tyme he ſhall doo his kynde whiche
tyme they knowe and fele by the courſe
of the bodyes aboue. For as ſayth
the phyloſophre / the bodyes here aboue
meſure all thynges here bynethe
as anentes tyme. And therfore ſayth
Dauyd. That by nyght whan the
ſonne is downe / than in derkeneſſe begynne
beſtes of raueyn to walke & ſeke
theyr pray & theyr mete / whan the
ſonne ryſeth they go ayen to her dennes
& hyde theym / than goo men out
to werke tyll it be nyght / not that the
ſonne ne the mone cauſe hem to do ſo
but only the lawe of kynde ordeyned

of god techeth hem ſo to do & to kepe
theyr kyndly tyme. In the dawynge
& ſpryngyng of the daye byrdes begȳ
                  ne
to ſynge / floures to ſprede & ſprynge
that by nyght were full cloſe. Man
byrde & beſte begynne to gladde for
Ioye of the lyght / & for the tyme of
theyr myrthe & of theyr kyndly werkyng
cometh ayen by the preſence of
the ſonne whiche ſerueth theym pryncypally
of lyght & of tyme. The ſonne
ruleth them not proprely to ſpeke / but
kynde ruleth them in tyme by the
courſe of the ſonne & by the courſe of
the bodyes aboue. We fynde in holy
wryte Gen̄ .i. That the erthe at the
byddynge of god brought forth trees
graſſe and herbes. Trees and herbes
brought forth theyr fruyte / eche in
theyr owne kynde. The thyrde daye er
god made ſonne mone and ſterres.
And badde the erthe & gaue it vertue
& nature to bryng forth graſſe & fruyte
of many & dyuerſe kynde. He gaue
not the ſonne ne the mone ne ſterres
that nature. He made theym the fourthe
daye to ſhyne & to be in tokenes
of tyme to all creatures here bynethe
in erthe. God gaue graſſe trees & herbes
dyuerſe vertues & wonderfull nature
to bud & brynge forth leues fayre
& grene in dyuerſe fourme / floures
fayre bloſſomes bryghte of dyuerſe
ſhappe & of dyuerſe colours that noo
man by crafte can deuyſe. Alſo he gaue
them nature to brynge forth fruyt
fayre & fyne / ſome in the wynter & ſome
in the ſomer. Some he ordeyned
in tyme to leſe theyr leues & theyr grenehede.
Some to be grene wynter &
ſomer / as lorell / boxe / holme / yue / and
many moo. Whan other herbes ſere
and drye vp / than in the colde weder
ſaffrone begynneth to ſprynge / and
with his floures bryngeth his fruyte.
Suche dyuerſyte in kynde in tree and
in graſſe / in beeſt fyſſhe and foule / vertues
ſoo dyuerſe in ſtoones and other
thynges deuyſed neuer ne made the
ſonne ne mone ne the ſterres. But he
that made ſonne mone and ſterres / and
all thynge in kynde / he made &
ordeyned / and he gouerneth & kepeth
all this eche in his owne kynde / and
hath aſſygned eche creature here bynethe
his due tyme / his nature to doo
and to ſhewe. In one londe falleth
hongre / & in an other place plente of
all goodes. In one londe is plente
of wyne / & in an other none. In one
contree is plente of wulle good & clene
/ & in other lytyll & full vnthende.
In one contree is plente of golde &
ſyluer & of other metalle / and in another
lytyll or nought. Somtyme is
morayne general / & ſomtyme parcyal
in one contree & not in an other. Some
tyme in one towne and not in the
next. Somtyme in that one ſyde of

houſeholde it taketh vp all hole / & in
the next it taketh none. Some deye
in yougthe / and ſome in elde / ſome in
myddell age / ſome well / ſome euyll / ſome
with lytyll payne / & ſome with
moche payne. How ſholde men knowe

¶Pauper. That falleth ayenſt comon

tourned vp ſo downe / myſſhape
thynges in theyr byrthe ayenſt kynde
Theſe & ſuche other that falle ayenſt

But I pray the what betokened that
wonderfull comete and ſterre whiche
appered vpon this londe / the yere of
our lorde a thouſande four hondred
and two from the feſte of the Epyphanye
tylle two wekes after Eeſter
that was in the myddell of Aprylle.
¶Pauper. It was an open token of
the grete offence to god with the people
of Englonde / and that harde
wretche was comyng but yf they wolde
amende them of her falſhode and
traytourye / periurye / murdre / myſpryde
in euery degree and ouerdone / couetyſe

and ydolatrye / lechery and leſynges
without ſhame / and other ſynnes many

all cryſtendome and ſclaundre to alle

theym not ne wyll not amende

by ſynne of falſehode / murdre / and
manſlaughter / trauayle for to mayntene
theyr olde ſynnes / therfore vengeaunce
falleth as the ſterre betokened.
God of his mercy ſmyteth not
all atte ones / but lytyll and lytyll / that
by the lytyll men ſholde beware
of the more. But allas ther ben but
fewe or no man that wyll be ware or

euery man is gladde of others wo.
And ſo I drede me that god wyll make
an ende of this londe / for we loue
no peas / we ſeke no mercy. But all
our lykynge is all in warre / in wo / in

But god of his mercy letteth hym / for

god that is ſouerayne treuthe / & for

his lykyng & his trauayll is

The fende fayneth hym to be

yf he make hym a Iuſtyce by his owne

for to ſlee Innocentes than for to ſlee
theues. Yf ſuche wytchecraftes were
vſed / many Innocentes and many a
good man and woman ſholde be taken
& ſlayne / & theues ſholde go free.
For the fende is more fauourable to
theues / manquellers / lecherous and
to all other ſynfull wretches than he
is to ony good man or good woman
and he hath more lykynge for to ſlee
a good man or good woman than to
ſlee a theef. Alſo god ſayth in the goſpell
that the fende hath euer ben a
lyer / and ſtode neuer in trenthe / and
that he is a manqueller / and fader
of lyers and of leſynges. And therfor
all thoo that gyue fayth to his tales
and doo therafter as moche as is in

theyr god that is ſouerayne treu

they worſhyppe the fende and dyſpyſe

euery man myght accuſe other
of what ſynne that he wolde / and
ſaye that the fende or the wytches tolde

man myght kylle & ſlee other. And
therfore for theſe ſkylles and reaſons
and many moo and for to flee theſe
perylles and many other / god hath
forboden all maner of wytchecrafte / for
it is not done withouten helpe of

yf he ſuffred hym for to ſaye ſothe / Englyſſhe
people ſholde forſake god
all attones and ſette theyr truſte and

that they fynde the

For it is not ſemely that the fendes

thynge & the more holy prayer that

to fulfyll thynges that they done it
for / & ſo it ſtandeth only in the deuyll

For the fende wolde not do theyr

For whan that they lyght the
candell and ſaye theyr Pater noſter / to
that intente / they do it not to god / but
to the fende. And in that they forſake
god and worſhypp the fende as
god / and clayme the fende to theyr fader
/ ſayeng to hym that they ought
to ſaye only to god / as Pater noſter
qui es in celis &

all that foloweth they ſaye it to the
fende And therfore y• fende may clay

reſonably forſake them & ſay to them
that he ſayd to the Iewes. Vos facitis

And in the ſame maner theyr chaſty
te / theyr faſtynge / theyr penaūce doynge
is in as moche as they doo it to
pleaſe the fende & for a wycked ende
it is a ſeruyce & a ſacrefyce to the fende.
And full fewe men or wymen wyl

them ſelfe with launcettes / and ſo offre

theyr fleſſhe and theyr blood in ſacrefyce

And therfore byleue frendes ſythen
this maner of ſynne is ſo greuoꝰ
ſo hydeous & ſo abhomynable in goddes

none of your houſholde / for no loſſe

yf ye do it your ſelfe / or do it to be done
/ or aſſente to the doynge / or ſuffre
it to be done whan ye myght lette it
ye be acurſed & offende your god full
hyghely & full greuouſly. For all they
that do it or aſſente to the doynge / &
ſette theyr fayth therin / they forfete
ayenſt the fyrſte cōmaundement full

god / and make the fende theyr god / and
worſhyppeh hym as god. And
by what thynge y• they do theyr wytchecrafte
/ be it fyre / be it ayer / or water
/ or erthe / or deed bones / or ony other
thynge that is in theyr mawme
trye / & that they make ſymylytude to

in the fyrſte cōmaūdement that
man ſhode not make hym lykeneſſe
y• is in heuen / that is to ſaye / neyther
in the fyrmament / ne in the fyre / ne
in the ayer. And ſo in that worde he
forbedeth the Iudycyall aſtronomye / and
pyromancye / that is wytchecrafte
done in the fyre / and aeromancye / that
is wytchecrafte done in the ayer.
Alſo he forbedeth men to make them
lykeneſſe of ony thynge that is in erthe.
In that he forbedeth geomancy
that is wytchecrafte done in the erthe
And alſo nygromancye / that is wytchecrafte
done by deed bodyes that
ben but erthe / and buryed in the erthe.
Alſo he forbedeth men to make
them ſymylytude of ony thynge that
is in the water vnder the erthe. In
whiche wordes he forbedeth ydrom ā

none ſuche thynges as god / ne
ſette theyr truſte ne theyr fayth therin.
For yf they doo they make ſuche
thynges lyke god in as moche as in
them is. And not only they make ſuche
thynges lyke god in this maner / but
alſo they make the fendes lyke
god / whiche dwelle ſome in the fyre / ſome
in the ayer / ſome in the water / and
ſome in the erthe for to tempte

¶Diues. Shewe me ſome

¶Pauper. I am beſy for to deſtroye
wytchecrafte and not for to teche

maners of wytchecraftes y•
they may not be tolde in ſpecyall.
I praye the telle me in generall
what is wytchecraft. ¶Pauper. Euery
craft that man or woman vſeth to
knowe ony thyng or to do ony thyng
that he may not knowe ne do by the
waye of reaſon ne by the werkyng of
kynde is wytchecrafte. And though it
be do by waye of kynde / and they vſe
therto ony charmes or nyce obſeruaū
                  ces
in the doynge / wenynge that it
myght not be done without that charme
/ & ſuche obſeruaunce or ellys ſuche
charmes oonly to blynde the people
that they ſholde truſte in hym for
his charmes and not in werkyng of
kynde / it is wytchecrafte all yf he ſay
only his Pater noſter / in the doynge
for to be holden a charmer / & to do y•
people truſte in hym pryncypally for
charmes / all though he ſayth no charmes
but werketh only by kynde / yet
he is a wytche & his doynge is wytche
crafte. For by ſuche doynge he blyndeth
the people and dyſceyued them / and
doth them truſte in wytchecrafte
& ſo do worſhyp to the fende and deſpyte
to god. And what ſo euer man
or woman do by waye of kynde & reaſon
/ yf he vſe ony crafte of Iapery &
faytrye for to blynde the people / for to
do them byleue that he were a wytche
and that he dyde it not by waye of
kynde / but by charmes and ſorcery / he
is a wytche in goddes ſyght / and
his doynge is wytchecrafte. For his
crafte is to make men worſhyppe the
fende / in as moche as he doth the people
truſte in wytchecrafte / & ſo ſpende
theyr good in the fendes ſeruyce / and
to ſeke helpe of the fende & forſake
goddes helpe. And hath leuer
hym ſelfe for to be holden a wytche
and the deuylles ſeruaunte / than for
to be holden goddes ſeruaunte / and
leuer for to take mennes good in worſhyppynge
of the fende than in worſhyppyng
of god. And by the connynge
& grace that god hath gyuen hym
and by the myght & vertue that god
hath gyuen to thynges of kynde for
helpe of mannes kynde / falſely he
enhaunceth the fendes crafte in deſtruccyon
of mankynde. ¶Diues.
               
                  
Tell ſome example. ¶Pauper. To
hele mannes woundes whyle they be
freſſhe and clene / blacke wulle and
oyle ben full medycynable without
ony charme as experyence ſheweth
well. But for as moche as men wene
that it were nought worthe without
the charme / & ſette theyr fayth pryncypally
in the charme / therfore it is
to them a wytche crafte. But though
a man in the doyng ſay his pater noſter
/ or ſome holy prayer callynge the
grace of god in his doynge it is noo
wytche crafte but it is well done.

rather in god. ¶Diues. Is it ony
wytche crafte to charme adders or other
beſtes & byrdes with holy wordes
or holy wryte or with ony other holy
wordes ¶Pauper. Yf a man or woman
take hede in his doynge only to
the holy wordes and to the myght of
god / it is noo wytche crafte. But yf
they vſe in theyr dooynge ony myſobſeruaūce

as clerkes ſaye it is wytche craft
                     •
                   / and
the effecte therof yf it falle it cometh
of the fende / & namely in adders and
ſerpentes. For the adder was the fyrſte
Inſtrumente that the fende vſed
for to dyſceyue mankynde / as we fynde
Geneſis .iij. And yet by the adder
he dooth men mooſt truſte in wytche
crafte. ¶Diues. Is it ony p
                     •
                  ryll to
man or woman to charge his frende
in his deyeng to come ayen & teile hȳ
how he fareth. ¶Pauper. It is a ful
grete peryll. For as ſaynt Poule ſayth
The fende oftyme maketh him lyke
an angell of lyght / but he may not
laſte in the beaute ne bryghtnes. And
ſo lyghtly the fende myght appere to
hym that were alyue in the lykeneſſe
of hym that were deed & telle hym leſynges
/ and in caſe make hym ſoo afered
that he ſholde leſe his wytte &
falle in wanbyleue as it felle to one
within a fewe yeres. And happely he
ſholde telle hym that he were dampned
though it were not ſo / or telle him
that he were in blyſſe though he were
in bytter payne / and ſoo lette hym
of his almeſdede and from his holy
prayers and other good dedes by whiche
not only that ſoule ſholde be holpen
/ but many other with hym. Alſo
yf he appered to hym / or yf he wende
that he appered to hym he ſholde haue
the leſſe mede for his byleue than
he hadde byfore / for than were he techeth
by experyence to knowe that
the ſoule lyueth after the bodye. Alſo
it is not in the ſoules power to appere
to man or woman after the deth of

his bodye / ne man is not able to ſee a
ſoule / for it is Inuyſyble without a ſpecyall
myracle of god. And ſo both he
that chargeth hym to come ayen / &
he that behoteth to come ayen tempten
god. And right as god wyll that
euery man & woman be vncertayne
what tyme he ſhall deye / for that he
ſholde alway be dredeful to do amys
and beſy to do well. Right ſo he wyll
that men be vncertayne of theyr frendes
whan they ben deed in what ſtate
that they ben / for that they ſholde
alwaye be beſy to helpe theyr ſoules
with maſſes ſyngynge almes doynge
with bedes byddynge / and other good
dedes / not oonly for helpe of hym but
of other that haue lytyl helpe or none
Alſo for encreſyng of theyr owne mede.
For who ſoo that trauaylleth well
for an other / trauaylleth beſt for hym
ſelf. For as ſaynt Poule ſayth. Ther
ſhall no good dede be vnrewarded / ne
no wycked dede be vnpunyſſhid. ¶Diues.
Thy reaſon is good. For yf men
wyſte that theyr frendes were out of
payne they wolde do right nought for
them / & ſo they ſholde leſe moche mede
for that knowyng / & ſoules leſe moche
helpe. And yf men wyſte for certayne
whan they ſholde deye / they
ſholde be to bolde to do amys in hope
that they ſholde amēde them in theyr
deynge. But yet notwithſtandyng al
thy reaſons / ſome clerkes ſayen that
it is lefull to men for to charge theyr
frendes to come aren to ſhewe them
her ſtate after theyr deth. For as they
ſaye it is kyndely thynge for to deſyre
for to knowe or to conne. For the
phyloſophre ſayth that euery man &
woman by waye of kynde deſyreth to
knowe and to conne. Omnes homines
natura ſcire deſiderant. ¶Pauper.
They ſaye ſothe / and not ayenſt
me. For it is lefull to euery man and
woman for to deſyre to conne and to
knowe. But it is not lefull for to deſyre
to knowe in that maner / ne by
noo meane vnlefull not by techynge
of the fende / neyther by techynge of
them that ben deed.

It is a grete foly to truſte therin
For as I ſayd now late / god wyl that
man & woman be vncertayne what
tyme that they ſholde deye & in what
maner. For god wyll that man and
woman be alwaye beſye to flee ſynne
and for to do well for drede of deth / and

mooſt to his worſhyppe and helpe of

for to ſette ſayth in ſuche nyce obſeruaūces

may praye & ought to praye / but god
ſhall graūte as hym lyketh / & as he
ſeeth that it is mooſt ſpedefull to vs &

Salomon ſayth. Nemo ſit vtrū amore

               DIues. Is it lefull to ſette
ony truſte or ony fayth on
dremes. ¶Pauper. Ther
ben two maner cauſes of dremes.
One from inwarde / & an other from
outwarde. Cauſes of dremes from
inwarde ben thre maner. One is comon
ſterynge of mannes fantaſye or
womans in theyr ſlepe / & ſuche dremes
ben but fantaſyes and vanytees
And therfore ſayth Salomon. Vbi
multa ſomnia. ibi multe vanitates.
Eccle. v. Where as ben many dremes
ther ben many vanytees / for in this
maner one man ſhall haue moo dremes
than ſome twenty other Another
cauſe from inwarde is ye dyſpoſycōn
of the bodye. For whan men ben colde
of kynde / they dreme of froſtes &
ſnowe / and ſo by theyr dremes a wyſe
leche may knowe in parte the dyſpoſycōn
of ther bodye / be it to helthe
or to ſekenes. The thyrde cauſe from
inwarde is the dyſpoſycōn of ye ſoule
For comonly men dremen of ſuche
thynges as ther ſoules & theyr thoughte
is mooſt in occupyed whyle yt they
waken / eyther by ſtudye / by loue / or by
hate / by wrath / by drede / by ſorowe / by

care pryde or couetyſe. Cauſes of dremes
from outwarde ben two maner / bodely
& ghooſtly. Bodely is the dyſpoſycōn
of the ayer and of the place
about hym / & other thynges beſyde
hym. And therfore in rayne weder
men dreme of water & of fyſſhes / for
ofte mānes bodye chaūgeth after the
dyſpoſycyon of the ayer & of his abydynge
place And for theſe thre cauſes
ſayth the phyloſophre De ſomno et
vigilia. That leches ſholde take bede
to the dremes of them that ben ſeke
to knowe therby how they ben dyſpoſed.
Ghooſtly cauſes from outwarde
of dremes ben ij. maners / the one is
good / for that is god by hym ſelfe / or
ellys by angellys / & that in thre maners.
For ſome dreme ſo by ymagynacyon
only / as dyde the kyng Pharao
& Nabugodonoſor. Some dreme only
by vnderſtandynge / as dyde ſaynt
Poule & Balaam. Some dreme bothe
by ymagynacōn & by vnderſtandyng
/ as dyde ſaynt Iohan in apocalyps
& Danyell in his prophecye / whiche
ſawe wonderfull ſyghtes by
ymagynacōn & vnderſtandyng what
tho ſyghtes betokened. But Pharao
and Nabugodonoſor vnderſtonde not
the vyſyons ne the dremes that they
had. The other cauſe of dremes from
outwarde is not good as whan it falleth
by Illuſyon of the fende / for tho
pryncypally ſerue to wytche crafte.
Somtyme dremes come of grete beſyneſſe
& trauayl that one hath whan
he is wakyng And therfor ſayth Salomon
/ that after beſyneſſe folowen
many dremes / for comonly men dreme
of ſuche thynges as they ben in
occupyed whyle they wake. Somtyme
dremes come of to moche abſtynance
& of hongre. Somtyme it cometh
of exceſſe of mete or of drynke.
Somtyme of myſlykynge that man
hath whan he is wakyng. And in as
moche as the effecte of thynges is token
of his cauſes / as ſmoke is token
of the fyre / ſoo ſuche dremes ben tokens
of cauſes yt they come of. And
in this maner awyſe man may telle
by dremes cauſes of mannes dremes / &
ſo by cauſes telle other preuy thynges
that may fall therof. For oftyme
one cauſe bryngeth forth dyuerſe effectes
eche after other. ¶Diues. Telle
ſome examples. ¶Pauper. Experyence
ſheweth that yf a man talke moche
with a woman & ſette his herte
gretely to her by daye / & in the nyght
folowyng he dremeth of her ſome nyce
dreme / by whiche dreme yf he tolde
it to ſome wyſe man / he wolde ſay
that he loued moche that woman / &
but he withdrewe hym from her company
/ it ſholde tourne hym to felony
And alſo as clerkes ſaye in aſmoche
as dremes come by waye of kynde / in
ſoo moche it is lefull to telle what
they ſygnefye after the cauſes yt they
come of / ſoo that in theyr tellynge &
caſtyng they paſſe not the boūdes of
kynde. Alſo it is lefull to telle thynges
that ben to come / by dremes that
come by reuelacōn of god / yf man &
woman haue y• grace to vnderſtande
them as Ioſeph and Danyell hadde
But for as moche as dremes comen
in ſoo dyuerſe maners / certayne it is

full harde to knowe in what maner
they come / whether by god or by kynde
or by y• fende or by ony other waye
Therfore it is full peryllous to ſette
ony fayth therin / as ſaynt Gregorye
ſayth li .viij. morx. ſuꝑ illud Iob. Terrebis
me ꝑ ſompnia. For ſomtyme by
dremes the fende behoteth men grete
proſperyte & moche richeſſes to brynge
them in pryde & hope of thynges
that they ſholde neuer haue. Somtyme
by dremes he pretendeth moche
aduerſyte & grete dyſeaſe for to brynge
folke in ſorowe & drede & grete heuynes
/ & yf he may to brynge them in
to dyſpayre / for nyce fantaſyes that
he bryngeth them in. And ſomtyme
for men ſette fayth in ſuche dremes / god
ſuffreth ſuche myſchyues to falle
to theym as theyr dremes pretende in
punyſſhynge of theyr ſynne / for that
they ſette in dremes ayenſt the lawe
of god. But proſperyte falleth them
none for no ſuche dremyng. ¶Diues
Where fyndeſt yu that god forbedth
men to ſette fayth in dremes.

               Pauper. Leuitici .xix. where as
god ſayth thus. Non auguria
bimini. nec obſeruabit ſompnia.
Ye ſhall not dyuyne ne make
you wyſe of preuy thynges by no wyt
checrafte / & ye ſhall wayte after noo
dremes ne take hede therto / ne ſette
fayth therin. Alſo Deut0 .xviij. God
forbedeth all maner wytchecraftes &
charmes / & byddeth that no man ſholde
take hede to dremes. And in the ſame
boke .xiij. god ſayth thus Yf be ſo
ſayth he that ony man amonges you
begynneth to be a ſoche ſayer & a prophete
/ & ſaye that he had a dreme & a
vyſyon & telle ony wonder / whiche
wonder & token falleth as he ſayth / yf
he ſtyre the to mawmetrye or to ony
wytchecrafte / here not the wordes
of that prophete and of that dremer.
For by hym god aſſayeth you / that it
may be openly knowen whether ye loue
hym with all your herte & ſoule or
nay. And therfore god byddeth that
ſuche dremers & prophetes ſholde be
ſlayne & though he were thyn owne
brother by fader & by moder yu ſholdeſt
not ſpare hym in that caas. And
therfor Salomon ſayth / that dremes
haue alſo brought moche people in
errour & in folye / and they that truſte
therin falle to nought. Eccle .xxxiiij.
For all yf dremes come oftymes by
waye of kynde as I ſayd / yet it is ful
harde to knowe whan it cometh by
waye of kynde or by Illuſyon of the
fende. And though they come by way
of kynde & though a man knowe the
cauſes in kynde of dremes / yet it is
full harde to telle certaynely what yt
falle therof / for only god knoweth for
certayne thynges that ben to come / &
he may chaūge & lette the werkynge
of kynde. And alſo though men knowe
the cauſes of kynde that dremes
come of / yet knowe they not what lettynges
ben on other byhalfe by waye
of kynde. ¶Diues. Telle ſome exāple.
¶Pauper. Whan ſmoke medled
with fyre cometh out of an houſe by
the wyndowe or by the louerys / men
that ſeen it from ferre wyll ſaye that

that houſe ſhall go on fyre. And yet
ther may be ſoo good helpe nyghe for
to quenche the fyre that yt houſe ſhal
take but lytyll harme. And many a
man by waye of kynde is dyſpoſed to
dyuerſe ſekeneſſe / but yet he may ſoo
gouerne hym & vſe ſuche medecynes
that he ſhall lette that dyſpoſycōn of
kynde and not haue ſuche ſekekeſſes.
¶Diues. By the ſame reſon though
a dreme come of goddes ſendynge to
helpe of mannes ſoules and in warnynge
of myſchyef to come / he ſholde
take none hede therto / ne ſette ne faythe
therin / for he wote not fro whens
it cometh. ¶Pauper. Without reuelacōn
of god he wote not fro whens
it cometh. And therfor whan god ſendeth
ſuche dremes / he ſhall ſhewe to
hym that thus dremeth / or to ſome
other from whens it cometh / & what
it betokeneth. As he dyde to the kyng
Pharao by Ioſeph / and to the kyng
Nabugodonoſor by Danyell.

               DIues. Yf man or woman haue
a dreme that ſtyreth them
to good werkes and to vertue
and to flee ſynne and to amende his
lyfe / may he not ſette his fayth therin
/ and do therafter. ¶Pauper. Whether
it cometh of god or of the fende / it
is leful to hym for to ſette his fayth
therin and to do therafter. For it ſtyreth
hym to thynges that he is bounden
to without ony dreme And oftymes
bothe fende and the fendes lymmes
teche well though they doo full
euyll. But a man ſo dremynge muſte
be full well ware / that for ſuche dremes
he take none hede to other dremes
that ſtyre him to vanyte or to curyoſyte
for to knowe thynges that be
to come / or other preuy thynges / or to
myſdeme of his euen cryſten / or to hate

as moche as they ſtyre them to god &
to goodneſſe / he may folowe his dremes
& do after them wyſely & warly
for ofte the fende vnder colour of holyneſſe
deſceyueth bothe man and woman.
¶Diues. Moche people hadde
leuer for to dreme of the fende than
of god or of his moder Marye / for as
they ſaye, whan they dreme of the fende
they fare well in the daye folowynge
/ but whan they dreme of god or

¶Pauper. Suche people fare the
worſe for theyr myſbyleue and theyr
nyce fantaſye and ſynne full greuouſly
/ & be full euyll dyſceyued by the gyle
of the fende. For whan the fende
ſeeth that a man ſhall haue dyſeaſe / he
maketh hym in the nyght byfore
to dreme of god & of our lady & of other
ſayntes / or of men of relygyon &
ſo to make hym to haue leſſe deuocōn
to god & our lady and other ſayntes / and
leſſe affeccōn to men of relygyon
bycauſe of his dyſeaſe that ſhall falle

dyſeaſe that he thynketh for to
brynge in hym / he trauaylleth to brynge
hym in to ghooſtly dyſeaſe and in
depe ſynne. And therfore whan men

wyll be foles and ſette theyr fayth to
ſuche dremes that come ſo by gyle of
the fende for as moche as dyſeaſe falleth
to them ones or t
                     ••
                  es after ſuche

fende in punyſſhynge of theyr ſynne
& of theyr myſbyleue for to doo them
dreme ofte of ſuche maner / & after to
do them dyſeaſe as they byleue to haue.
And therfore whan men hadde ſuche
dremes with dyſeaſe ſo folowynge
and began to haue ony fantaſy or
fayth therin / they ſholde ſhryue them
therof to ſome wyſe man & telle hym
the fendes gyle and they ſholde fare

of our lady and of holy men that haue
faren ful wel afterwarde / for they

after for theyr myſbyleue / & oftymes
they faren full euyl whan they dreme
neyther of god ne of our lady.

               IN the ſame maner. Some

the waye than to mete with a knyght
or a ſquyre / or with ony man of relygyon
or of holy chirche / for than they
ſaye and byleue that they ſhall haue
golde. For ſomtyme after the metynge
of a frogge or a tode / they haue reſceyued
golde / and ſo they falle in myſbyleue
and deſpyſen theyr euen cryſten.
For I wote well that they reſceyue
golde of men or of wymen / but not
of frogges ne of todes / but it be of
the deuyll in lykeneſſe of a frogge or
a tode. And they mete with many a
foule frogge & tode in the yere & yet
reſceyue they no golde for that metynge.
And yf they reſceyued ony golde / they
ſholde thanke god & theyr euen

they may nought gyue theym. And
theſe labourers deluers & dykers that
mooſt mete with frogges and todes

ſo they falle in wanbyleue and thanke

now that the Englyſſhe nacyon had
worſhypped god paſſynge all y• other
nacyons. But now I ſee well that it
is not ſo. For moche of my nacyon is
entryked and blente with ſuche fantaſyes
many mo than I can tell. And
ſo they forfete hyghely ayenſt the fyrſte
cōmaundement that ought mooſt
for to be charged. For that techeth vs
how that we ſholde worſhyp our god
aboue all thynge. And ther is neyther
byſſhopp ne prelate ne curate ne prechoure
that wyll ſpeke ayenſt the vyces
and errours that ben ſo hyghe ayenſt
goddes worſhyppe. And ſo by
myſuſe & ſleuthe of men of holy chirche
vyce is take for vertue / and errour
for treuthe / the fende is worſhypped &
god is deſpyſed. Neuertheleſſe as men
ſaye / god is in no londe ſo well ſerued
in holy chirche / ne ſo moche worſhyped
in holy chirche as he is in this
londe. For ſo many fayre chirches ne
ſo good araye in chirches / ne ſo fayre
ſeruyce as men ſaye is in none other
londes as it is in this londe. ¶Pauper.
As ſaynt Gregorye ſayth in his
Omelye / god taketh more hede to a
mannes herte than to his gyfte / and
more to his deuocyon than to his dede.
He taketh no grete hede ſayth he
how moche a man or woman gyueth
or offreth in holy chirche / but he taketh
hede of how moche deuocōn & of
what herte he gyueth & offreth. And
ſo a poore man or woman hath ſome
tyme more thanke for the gyfte of an
halfpeny / than ſome riche man hath
for the gyfte of .xx. ſhelynges. Yf the
makynge of chirches and the ournamentes
and the ſeruyce in this londe
were done pryncypally for deuocyon / and
for the worſhyp of god. I trowe
this londe paſſed all other londes in
worſhyppynge of god & holy chirche.
But I drede me that men do it more
for pompe and pryde of this worlde
to haue a name and worſhyp therby
in the contree / or for enuye that one
towne hath ayenſt an other / not
for deuocōn / but for the worſhyp and
the name that they ſee them haue by
araye and ournamentes in holy chirche
/ or ellys by ſlygh couetyſe of men
of holy chirche. ¶Diues. What fantaſye
haſte thou that men do it not
for deuocyon. ¶Pauper. For the people
now a dayes is full vndeuoute to
god and to holy chirche / and they loue
but full lytyll men of holy chirche
and they ben lothe for to come in holy
chirche whan they be bounde to come
thyder / and full lothe to here goddes
ſeruyce. Late they come and ſoone
they go awaye. Yf they ben there a lytyll
whyle theym thynketh full longe
They haue leuer to go to the tauerne
than to holy chirche. Leuer to here
a ſonge of Robynhode / or of ſome rybaudrye
/ than for to here maſſe or matynes
/ or ony other of goddes ſeruyce
or ony worde of god. And ſythen that
the people hath ſo lytyll deuocyon to
god and to holy chirche. I can not ſee
that they do ſuche coſte in holy chirche

for deuocōn ne for the loue of god
For they deſpyſe god daye and nyght
with theyr euyll and wycked lyuynge
and theyr wycked thewys.

of hyghe chirches / in riche veſtymentes
/ in curyouſe wyndowes / in
grete belles / for god is not holpen therby

they leſe moche mede. Yf they do it of
deuocyon with dyſcrecōn / it is medefull.
For euery man poore and riche
after his power is boūde to worſhyp
goddes houſe / ſo that god lorde of all
be honeſtly and worſhypfully ſerued.
And therfore god bad in y• olde lāwe
that his people ſholde make-hym a
full coſtly tabernacle at his owne deuyſe.
And he badde Salomon make
hym a full coſtly temple / & yet without
doubte there was many a poore
man that tyme / both blynde & lame
amonge goddes people. Moyſes. Dauyd.
Salomon. Ioas. Ioſyas. Eſdras
Iudas machabeus / & many other bothe
in the olde lawe and in the newe
ben prayſed hyghely of god for makynge
and worſhyppynge and mayntenynge
of goddes houſe and his ſeruyce.
And as we fynde in the goſpell / that
ther was a poore wydowe that
offred to amendynge of goddes temple
two mytes that ben worth a ferthynge
/ and ſhe was prayſed of Cryſt
for her offryng paſſyng al other that
offred than moche more. And we fynde
Exodi .xxx. That god badde that
in the nombrynge of the people euery
man ſholde paye to his tabernacle an
halfe ſycle / that was fyue pens / & that
the riche ſholde gyue no more than / and
the poore no leſſe / in a token that
that riche and poore ſholde be beſy
to worſhyp and to mayntene goddes
houſe and goddes ſeruyce. God badde
that bothe the riche & poore ſholde
paye alyke / in a token that the poore
man ſholde holde hymſelfe as moche
bounde to god as the riche / and the
good as the wycked. The good is
bounde to god for he kepte hym out
of ſynne. The wycked is bounde to
god for he kepeth hym that he peryſſhe
not for his ſynne. Alſo god badde
both riche & poore paye euen moche
to his tabernacle / in a token that they
ben bothe bought with one pryce of
Cryſtus precyouſe blood / & that they
ſholde both holde themſelf alyke boū
                  den
/ & that they haue both alyke nede
of ſuffrages & helpe of holy chirche.
Alſo god badde them both gyue alyke
in a token that he accepteth theyr
gyftes both alyke / yf theyr deuocōn be
alyke in theyr gyuynge that the riche
man ſholde not be proude of his grete
gyfte & of his richeſſes / ne the poore
falle in dyſpayre for his ſmale gyfte
and for his pouerte. Neuertheleſſe
who ſo may do mooſt beſt is bounde
to helpe goddes houſe what it nedeth

and ſo it is full nedeful to araye well
goddes houſe / and mayntene and encreaſe
goddes ſeruyce. And alſo it is
nedefull to helpe the poore folke in
theyr grete nede / and ſomtyme more
medefull than is that other. And therfore
my frendes thou muſte take hede
to the tyme and other cyrcumſtaū
                  ces.
For in tyme of welthe / of peas / and
of plente / whan the poore hath
ynough or lyghtly may be holpen / thā
pryncypally men ſholde trauaylle to
worſhypp goddes houſe & to encreaſe
and mayntene goddes ſeruyce. But
in tyme of wo warre and hungre of
pouerte and other trybulacōns / than
ſholde men pryncypally trauayll beſely
to theyr euen cryſten / and take hede
that no man ne woman peryſſhed
for defaulte / but by beſye to helpe the
nedy both by gyuyng and by lenyng.
In a token of this we rede .ij. Regū
.vij. et .i. Paralip .vij. et .xxij. That
god wolde not ſuffre the kyng Dauyd
to make his temple / notwithſtandynge
but he wolde full fayne haue
made it / and brought and ordeyned
full moche thynges therto. For in his
tyme the londe was in grete trybulacyon
by warre within and without / by
hungre & morayne / by dyſcenſyon
& debate of them ſelfe. But he ſayd
to Dauyd y• Salomon his ſone ſholde
make hym a temple. For he ſayd
he ſhall reygne in peas and in reſte / in
ſo moche that he ſhall be called a
kyng peaſyble / for in his dayes I ſhal
gyue peas & reſte in the londe of Iſraell.
And Dauyd whan he was in
peas and reſte and hadde dyſconfyte
his enemyes / than began he to ordeyn
for goddes Temple and wolde haue
made it. God coude him moche thanke
for his good wyll / but he wolde
not ſuffre hym for to make it / for he
was not in ſo good reſte as he hadde
wente to haue ben in. For after that
began a grete warre ayenſt hym. As
we fynde .ij.0 Regum .vij.0 et .viij.0
And therfor god ſayd to hym. Thou
ſhalt not make to me an houſe. for
thou haſte ſhedde moche blood / and
thou arte a man of bloodſhedynge
byfore me. That is to ſaye. I haue
ordeyned the for to fyght ayenſt myne

               BVt it fareth now a dayes by
moche folke as it dyde by Iudas
the traytour. We fynde in
the goſpell Iohēe.xij. That Marye
Magdaleyn anoynted the blyſful fete
of our lorde Iheſu with a precyous
oynement / not for ony grete nede that
Cryſte hadde therof / but for the grete
loue & deuocōn that ſhe had to hym.
Iudas was ſorowe therof & grutched
and ſayd / why is this oynement thus
loſte. It myght haue ben ſolde for
thre hondred pens / and be gyuen to
the poore folke. But as ſaynt Iohan
ſayth in the ſame place. Iudas ſayd
not tho wordes for the loue y• he hadde
to the poore folke / but for he was

a theef and robbed Cryſte and his dyſcyples
of moneye that was gyuen to
theym. And therfore he wolde that
the oynemente ſholde haue be ſolde
for thre hondred pens and gyuen to
Cryſte whiche loued well poore folke
that he myght haue myched or deled
the moneye awaye / for he bare y• purce.
And for that cauſe that he had not
his purpoſe of the thre hondred pens / therfore
he ſholde Cryſte for thre hondred
pens / that was .xxx. plates and
peces of ſyluer. For eche one of tho
xxx. was worthe .x. ſmale pens. In
the ſame maner / now a dayes ſome
folke grutche for deuocyons and nedeful
coſte that men done in holy chirche
/ and ſaye as Iudas ſayd / that it
were better to gyue it to poore folke.
But many of tho gyue full lytyll tale
how euyll the poore people fare / for
they do full lytyl to the poore folke or
to holy chirche eyther. But by ypocreſye
& ſymylacyon of almeſdede / they
withdrawen mennes deuocyon from
god and holy chirche / and from poore
folke alſo. And ſo they robbe holy
chirche and the poore folke. For they
done but lytyll them ſelfe / and lette
other that wolde do. And yf they do
almeſſe to the poore blynde & lame / they
do it to haue a name & for to exclude
or put behynde grete almeſſes
that they ben bounden to / as to worſhypp
of holy chirche / and in caſe good

In tho wordes Cryſte techeth vs not

diſtinc .i. ſi quis extra. Both
pryue prayers and open ben good yf
they ben done in due maner and in
due place and in due tyme. Prayers
is good in chambres and in oratoryes
but it is better in holy chirche with
the comunyte / whan the tyme is of comon
prayer / and whan men may wel
attende therto with feruent charyte.
Synguler prayer of one perſone is
good in a chambre & in an oratorye / but
better in a chirche with euen charyte.
But comon prayers of a comunyte
in chirche is better than a ſynguguler
prayer yf euery parte of that comunyte
be in charyte For Cryſt ſayth

gadred togydre in his name that is
charyte / there is he in the myddes of

to helpe them in theyr prayer. And yf

And whan ye be gadred / ſo make

they wolde no peas haue / ne deſyre

withſtandynge all the myſchyef ther

tho we haue the worſte on euery ſyde
yet the people ſayth that it is better

not lyue without warre. And whan
god ſente them worſhypfull peas on
euery ſyde they deſpyſe peas / and ſlee
them that made peas for that yt they
trauayled to make peas. And the people
had leuer paye grete taxes for ſhe
dynge of mannes blood than for to
paye ſmalle taxes for to haue peas.
And ſythen they loue no peas / ne deſyre
no peas and wyll haue none peas
thoughe god wyll gyue theym peas / without
doubte they praye not for
peas. For no man prayeth for a thynge
that they wyll not haue. And ſo in
theyr prayers and proceſſyons they
ſcorne god / and more prouoke hym to
vengeaunce than to mercy. Alſo they
make not theyr prayers with lownes
but with grece pryde / for they wyl not
be knowen of ony myſchyef. They
holde them ſelfe ſo ſtronge and ſo wyſe
that as them thynketh they haue
no nede of ony helpe. And therfore
though god hereth vs not in our praers
ne helpeth vs not it is no wonder
For with our mouth we axe peas / but
with our herte we axe warre / & with

haue mercy on vs / but with our herte
we praye hym for to helpe vs to ſlee

that ye endes of ony thynge is bytweyne
the more lenger is the thynge. And
ſo it fareth by prayers. For that one
ende of our prayer is our herte / and
that other ende is god. And therfore

And in this maner the nerer a mannes

ſpeke moche in theyr prayers as hethen
men do. For they wene that god
ſholde not here them but yf they ſpake
moche. Alſo he badde vs not ſpeke
moche in our prayers as ypocrytes done
for to be holden holy and ſo gette
mennes good. For as Cryſte ſayth in
the goſpell Luce .xxiij. Suche deuoure
wȳdowes houſes by faynynge of longe
prayers. For as the gloſe ſayth there
/ they praye lenger than other for to
be holden more relygyouſe and more
holyer than other / and therfore theyr
prayers torneth in to ſynne / in ſo moche
that they may neyther well praye
for them ſelfe ne for none other / and
for ſuche prayers they ſhall the more
be dampned / as Cryſte ſayth in the
ſame place Mar .vij. This peple worſhyppen
me with theyr lyppes / but
theyr herte is full ferre fro me. For
god is in heuen / and theyr herte and
thought is all in erthe. It is a comon
prouerbe / that who ſo ſpeketh vnwyſely
and vaynely / or in an euyll maner
/ he ſpeketh to moche. And therfor
as longe as a man or womā prayeth
wyſely / deuoutely / and with good intencyon
/ ſoo longe they ſpeke not to
moche. But yf they praye vnwyſely
with pryde and euyll intencyon / they
ſpeke to moche though they ſpeke neuer
ſo lytyl. And therfore the pharyſe
ſpake to moche in his prayer / for he
ſpake all with pryde. And Peter ſpake
to moche / for he ſpake vnwyſely / &
therfore Cryſte repreued them bothe.
Alſo they ſpeke to moche in theyr
prayers that ſette theyr herte & fayth
more in ſownynge and ſaynge of the
wordes than they do to god / or in the
thynges that they praye for / and ſaye
ayen and ofte ayen wenyng that god
herde them not but by ſuche yteracyons
tyll that they ben wery / and ſo leue
many deuocyons that they ſholde
ſaye. And therfore ſayth ye wyſe man
Non iteres verbū in oracōe tua Eccle
vij. Saye no worde ayen in thy praye
For ſuche doubte is lettynge of deuocyon
/ for ſuche ſpeke ouer moche and
make theyr prayers in wanbyleue.
For yf mannes herte be to god warde
god hereth his prayers longe byfor er
he ſpeke it with his mouth. ¶Diues.
Sythen god is ouer all preſente / why
pray we more in holy chirche than in
other places. ¶Pauper. For as moche
as he is ouer all / therfore in euery
place he ought to be worſhyped. But
for aſmoche as we may not worſhyp
hȳ in due maner in euery place. Therfore
is holy chirche ordeyned that men
ſholde fulfylle there yt they leue in other
places. And therfor in euery lawe
god hath ordeyned certayne places of
prayers where he wolde be worſhyped
in / paſſynge other places / and that for
many cauſes. Fyrſte for comon prayers
and prayſynge is more pleaſaunt
as I ſayd fyrſte. Alſo to flee errours
& ydolatrye. For yf eche man or woman
drewe him alwaye allone in his
prayers / the fende ſholde dyſceyue h
                     •
                  
                  ̄
                  
by Illuſyons & by Iapes / as he dooth
comonly them that flee companye / &
loue well to be moche ſolytarye. Alſo
for to exclude ſlouth in goddes ſeruyce
that man and woman ſholde falle
in. For but they were bounde to come
togydre in ſome certayne place for to
worſhyppe her god and to here goddes
lawe / they wolde ellys go playenge
& worſhyp god in no place but ful
ſelden. And they wolde excuſe theym
by vnconnynge yf they dyde amys.
Alſo holy chirche is ordeyned for comon
prayers & goddes ſeruyce that
eche man & woman may bere wytnes
of other at the daye of dome ayenſt
the fende / that he dyde in that as a
cryſten man ought to doo and ſerued
his god. For as ſaynt Poule ſayth / we
muſte all haue wytnes of our faythe
by dedes & tokenes outwarde.

               DIues. wherto ſholde we pray
to god for ony thynge / for he

nought gyue vs but he wyſte it well
byfore the begynnynge of the worlde
what he ſholde gyue vs. ¶Pauper.
We do not praye for to chaūge his endeles
ordenaūce / but for to gette to vs
by prayer that he hath ordeyned without
ende to graunte it vs by prayers.
For ſythen he is our lorde / & we may

¶Diues. Why praye we to god with

my frendes ye ſhall vnderſtande
that ther is two maner of prayers / one
is comon / an other is ſynguler.
Comon prayer is the prayers of the
mynyſtres of holy chirche and of comon
perſones in holy chirche / whiche
prayers they make in the name of al
the people. And this maner of prayer
muſte be done by mouth / that the people
may knowe that they praye for
them. And therfore it is ordeyned by
the lawe that ſuche prayers ſholde be
ſayd / and ſomtyme ſonge openly with
an hyghe voyce that the people may
here it. But ſynguler prayer that is
done but of one ſynguler perſone / it
may be done with herte allone without
voyce of the mouth. Neuertheles
ſomtyme it is good to hym yt prayeth
to praye by mouth. And that for many
cauſes. Fyrſte to excyte his herte
to more deuocyon by tokens outwarde.
And therfore as longe as a man
or a woman is ſtyred to deuocyon by
ſpeche or vocall prayer / by knelynge /

bowynge / faſtynge / or ony other obſeruaūce
reſonable / ſo longe it is well
done to vſe it in his prayer / but yf he
be letred therby from deuocōn & falle
therby in dyſtraccōn / it is better to leue
it for a tyme than to vſe it. For we
fynde primo Regū .ij. That Anna
ſpake in her herte to god with bytter
teres / & yet ther herde noman her voyce.
Alſo men praye with the voyce of
the mouthe in yeldynge of dette. For
man is boūden to ſerue god with all
his myght & vertue that god hath gyuen
hym / with herte worde & werke / with
all his myght & all his wytte.
And therfor holy chirche ſyngeth and
ſayth. Os lingua mens ſenſus vigor
confeſſionē ꝑſonent. Mouthe tongue
wytte & myght make knowlechynge
& prayſynge to god. And in this maner
bedes byddynge is parte of ſatyſfaccyon
for ſynne. Alſo men praye wt
voyce of the mouth for grete deuocōn
that is inwarde in herte / whiche breketh
out by ſpeche of the mouthe / as
ſayth Cryſte in the goſpell. Luce .vi.
Ex habundancia cordis os loquitur.
The mouthe ſayth he ſpeketh of ſuche
thynges wherof it is plente in the
herte. And therfore the prophete ſayth
Letatū eſt cor meū et exultauit lingua
mea. Myne herte ſayth he was mery
& gladde inwarde / & anone myn tongue
made Ioye outwarde. Alſo men
praye with voyces in ſpeche to the more
confuſyon of the fende / for he may
not knowe mennes deuocōn inwarde
but by tokens outwarde. And the more
deuocyon & loue that he ſeeth men
to haue to god / the more is it his confuſyon
& payne. And therfore is he ſo
beſy now a dayes to tempte men in
holy chirche to pryde / to couetyſe / ſleu
the / glotonye / & lecherye / for to lette
holy prayers in holy chirche / whiche
is to hym veray confuſyon & ſorowe.
And therfore ſayth the ꝓphete of hȳ

               DIues. In the begynnynge
of holy chirche & in the tyme
of the apoſtles was no ſuche
ſeruyce & ſolempnyte in holy chirche
as now is. ¶Pauper. Than were
but fewe cryſten men / & neyther they
myght ne durſte make ſuche ſolempnyte
for tyraūtrye of the hethen people.
Theyr wyll was good / but they
myght not / but as they myghten they
dyde worſhyp to god & encreaſed goddes
ſeruyce. And therfor we rede in the
lyfe of ſaynt Clement that by his prechynge
and techynge within one yere
were made .lxx. chirches in one lytylyle
of Cerlone / notwithſtandynge y•
ther were two thouſande of poore cryſten
men outlawed & dampned to ful
harde trauayll / & myght haue be releued
full well with that y• tho chirches
coſted. Than holy chirche was in his

youthe & in his begynnyng / as ſaynt
Ierom ſayth in ꝓlogo ſuꝑ actꝰ aplo
                     
                        
                     
                     rum
                  
Now holy chirche is growen / and the
fayth ſprongen & ſpredde & ſtabled in
peas fro tyraūtes. And therfore now
we muſte worſhypp our god with all
our myght & our connynge / for we
haue none excuſacōn as they hadde.
And for to auoyde ydleneſſe of preſtes
our faders byfore this tyme ordeyned
the prayers in holy chirche to be ſayd
after a certayne fourme / after the cuſtome
of dyuerſe contrees kepe theyr
hour after the houres of the daye / as
matynes atte morowe & maſſe afterwarde
/ and euenſonge ayenſt euen ſo
that god ſhall be prayſed of the preſtes
at all tymes of the daye. ¶Diues
Me thynketh yt it were better to ſaye
goddes ſeruyce in holy chirche without
note than with note & hackynge
of the ſyllabes & wordes of our prayers
& prayſynge as as we do For who
ſholde telle the kyng of Englonde a
tale or make his prayer to hym and
made ſo many notes & hackynges in
his tale / he ſholde haue lytyll thanke.
¶Pauper. The kyng of heuen is aboue
the kyng of Englonde / & otherwyſe
we muſte worſhyp hym than y•
kyng of Englond. For we muſte worſhyp
hym with all our myght / & all
our herte / & all our wytte / as hym yt
is maker & lorde of all thynge / & ſo
may we not worſhyp the kyng of Englonde.
It nedeth now to ſpeke to
the kyng of Englonde & to euery erthely
man dyſtynctly / for they knowe
not the mānes herte ne his wyll. But
god knoweth it longe er we ſpeke it
with our mouth. And therfore whan
we ſynge in our prayers with clēneſſe
of lyfe & deuocōn of herte / we pleaſe
god in as moche as we worſhyh hym
with our power of voyce and tongue
For euery note ſo ſonge to god in the
chirche or in other conuenyent places
for deuocōn in our ſelf / & to engendre
deuocōn in to other is a prayſynge to
god. And therfore Dauyd ſayth. Cantate
exultate et pſallite. Synge ye &
make you mery outwarde / & ſynge ye
to god craftely. Iubilate deo ois terra.
ſeruite dn̄o in leticia. Introite in
conſpectu eius. in exultacōe. All ye yt
dwelle vpon the erthe / make ye hertely
Ioye to god / ſerue ye our lorde in
gladneſſe. Entre ye in to his ſyghte
with Ioye & myrthe. For many cauſes
my frendes ſonge & melodye was
ordeyned in holy chirche. Fyrſt to the
more worſhyp of god. Alſo to the more
excytacōn of deuocōn to the people
Alſo to put awaye heuyneſſe & vnluſtyneſſe
/ as ſayth ſaynt Bernarde. For
many man hath more lykynge for to
ſerue god in gladneſſe than in heuyneſſe.
And therfor goddes ſeruyce ſholde
be ſayd lyuely / dyſtynctly / & deuoutly
with gladneſſe of herte. For yf the
ſeruyce be ſayd or ſonge ſo hauenly &
dedely & ſo drawen a longe that it lothe
both the ſynger or ſayer & the herer
/ & bryngeth folke in to heuyneſſe
or dyſtraccōn / it is euyll ſayd or ſonge.
For that maner of ſyngynge is lettynge
of moche goodneſſe / & cauſe of
ydleneſſe & of moche foly / for it maketh
men to withdrawe theym from
goddes houſe & from goddes ſeruyce / 

and ſo wante grace. De conſe. diſt. v.
Non mediocrit. Alſo we ſynge in holy
chirche to confourme vs to ſayntes
in heuen whiche prayſe god and ſerue
god alwaye with hyghe voyce & ſwete
ſyngynge / as we fynde in the Apocalyps
& many other places in holy
wryte. And therfore ſayth Dauyd.
Cantate dn̄o canticū nouū. laus eius
in ecclia ſancto
                     
                        
                     
                     rum
                  . Synge ye a newe
ſonge to our lorde / for ſuche is his pryſynge
in holy chirche of all ſayntes.
And therfore ſonge in holy chirche is
good whan it is ſonge deuoutely in
clennes of lyfe / roundely not lettynge
the deuoute prayers of the people / as
doth this curyouſe knackynge ſonge
of the vycyouſe mynyſtres in the chirche
/ & ſpecyally in grete & riche chirches.
For it is ofte ſeen / that the ſyngers
in ſuche places & other alſo ben
ful proude glotons and lecherous alſo.
And the melodye of ſuche men is
no pleſaunce to god / but it doth harme
to them ſelfe and many other.

for to be. ¶Pauper. We haue
now a dayes all to many martyrs
in this londe. ¶Diues. How ſoo.
¶Pauper. For the more martyrs the
more murdre and manſlaughter and
the more ſhedynge of Innocentes blode
/ the more vengeaunce ſhall falle
therfore. ¶Diues. Moche people is
ſlayne now a dayes / but yf they ſholde
be martyrs I can not ſay. ¶Pauper.
All that be ſlayne for the treuthe
pacyently in charyte ben martyrs / in
as moche as they wytneſſen the treuthe
& ſtonde therwith vnto theyr deth
For martyr in latyn is a wytneſſe in
englyſſhe. It is no worſhyp to ony londe
or nacyons for to haue many martyrs
of her owne ſleynge / but it is an
endles ſhame. And therfore the Iewes
that ſlewe Cryſte and his dyſcyples / &
the ꝓphetes & mad
                     •
                   martyrs without
nombre / ben in deſpyte and repreue
all about the worlde. And therfore
Cryſte ſayd to them that al the rightfull
blood whiche they had ſhedde fro
the begynnynge of the worlde ſholde
falle vpon them / & an harde vengeaū
                  ce
therfore ſholde come to them. And
the Romayns that ſlewe Peter and
many martyrs in euery londe there
as they hadde lordſhyp / and now they
haue loſt ther lordſhyp & ben wretches
of wretches / and bothe the cyte & the
temple ſemeth acurſed. And now Englyſſhe
nacōn hath made many martyrs.
For they ſpare neyther theyr owne
kyng ne theyr byſſhoppes / no dygnyte
/ no ordre / none aſtate ne degree / but
indyfferently ſlee as them lyketh / &
ſo vengeaūce & wretchedneſſe foloweth
them / & grace & worſhyp hath
forſaken them / it was neuer worſhyp
to them that they ſlewe ſaynt Thomas
theyr byſſhop & theyr fader / ne
that they wolde by comon clamour &
comon aſſent haue ſlayne theyr owne
kyng. Martyrdom is worſhypfull to
theym that in charyte ſuffreth deth / &
to theym y• holde with them in theyr
treuthe. But it is ſhame & dyſhoneſte
to theym that putte them to deth vnrightfully.

And for aſmoche as the
multytude of ſhrewes is ſo grete / and
falſhede is ſo myghty that the treuth
is ouerſette & borne downe / & true folke
ſo martred / we ſholde wepe & not
be gladde for that we haue ſoo many
martyrs / and nyght & daye crye mercy
to lett wretche. Yf hethen people or
other nacōns had made our martyrs
than we myght reioyſe vs of our martyrs
/ but in that we haue ſlayn them
our ſelfe we ought to be aſhamed.

               DIues. Sythen they be martyrs
why doth god no myracle
now for them as he dyde
for martyrs & other ſayntes in the begynnynge
of holy chirche. ¶Pauper.
Yf a lorde haue but a fewe ſeruaūtes
that ben true / he wyll prayſe them &
magnefye them & do them worſhyp / both
to holde them ſtylle in his ſeruyce
/ & alſo to drawe other to his ſeruyce
by enſample of them. And the ſame
dothe the mayſtre in the ſcole to
the childern that lerne wel. And whan
the moder hath but one childe ſhe cheryſeth
the more / and kepeth hym the
more godely & derely. Right ſo Cryſt
in the begynnyng of holy chirche had
but fewe good dyſcyples or true ſeruaūtes
/ & therfore he worſhypped &
magnefyed theym with grete myracles
to comforte them in the fayth / &
for to drawe other to the fayth. For
but god had ſhewed than grete myracles
and many / they that were in the
fayth ſholde haue forſaken the fayth
and fewe wolde haue come to the faythe.
And it fareth by holy chirche and
by y• fayth as it dothe by a tree / whan
a tree is newely ſette men water it &
ſette ſtakes & poles about to ſtrength
it ayenſt the wyndes blaſtes and for
ſtormes / it ſholde ellys bryſe it or breke
it and felle it a downe. But whan
it is wel roted & comonly wexen than
men ceſſe of waterynge & take awaye
the ſtakes and the poles. Right ſoo
whan holy chirche and cryſtendome
was in the begynnynge Cryſte watred
holy chirche with grete gyftes of
grace & of deuocōn / and vnderſette it
with grete wondres & myracles whiche
he ſhewed that tyme ayenſt the
harde ſtormes of perſecucōn that was
that tyme ayenſt the fayth of holy
chirche. But now holy chirche is ſprō
                  gen
& ſpredde & the fayth is ſtabled
in mennes herte / and therfore ſuche
myracles ceſſe. And yf ony ſuche myracles
falle in ony londe amonge ony
cryſten people / it is a token that ſome
of them be not ſtable in the fayth / &
that god is not well apayed with the
people. For ſaynt Poule ſayth that tokens
& myracles ben not gyuen to folke
of right byleue / but to folke of falſe
byleue And the more myracles that
men ſee / the leſſe mede they haue for
theyr fayth / as ſaynt Gregory ſayth
in his Omely. And ſo multytude of
martyrs & of myracles preue not by
the goodneſſe of the heople there they
ben done amonge / but rather they ſhewe
and preue the malyce of the people
whan god wolde deſtroye the kyngedome
of Iſraell and of Iuda for
ydolatrye & other ſynne that nygh al

the people was fallen in / he ſente his
famous prophetes / as Hely & Helyzee
Yſaye. Ieremye. Danyell. Ezechyell
& other .xij. prophetes whiche taught
the people goddes lawe / and warned
theym of myſchyef comynge but they
wolde amende theym. And they confermed
theyr ꝓphecy with many grete
myracles / & yet the people was worſe
than euer they were byfore. Att the
laſte Cryſte came to preche & to teche
them & dyde many wondres / & heled
all maner ſekeneſſes / & ſente his apoſtles
alſo amonges theym / whiche dyde
many wondrefull myracles. And
yet the people was than more worſer
than euer they were aforne. In ſoo
moche that they ſlewe not oonly the
prophetes and the apoſtles & Cryſtus
dyſcyples / but they ſlewe Cryſte hymſelfe
goddes ſone of heuen & lorde of
all thynge / whiche had done them ſo
moche worſhyp & done ſo many wondrefull

               DIues. I trowe that yf men
were now as holy as men were

¶Pauper. Though they were as
holy or holyer / they ſholde not do ſuche
myracles / for they be not now ſo
nedefull as they were that tyme / ne
it were not prouffytable to the people
as I ſayd right now. And I hope
that they ben as holy that do no myracles
as many of theym that done
myracles. For ſuche doynge of myracles
ſtandeth not in the holyneſſe of

ſtandeth in the callynge & in the vertue
of goddes name to the prouffyte
of other / & ofte to dampnacōn of hȳ

therby that ſhrewes and euyl wycked
lyuers may do myracles. ¶Pauper.
Cryſte ſayth ſo hym ſelfe Math .vij.
For as we rede there / at the daye of
dome many that ſhall be dampned / ſhall
ſaye to Cryſte. O lorde we prophecyed
in thy name and caſted out
fendes and dyde many tokens & myracles
in thy name. But he ſhall ſaye
to them ayen. Goo thou hens fro me
ye werkers of wyckedneſſe. I knowe
you not for none of myne. And as
ſaynt Iohan Cryſoſtomus ſayth in
tractatu. Nemo leditur niſi a ſemetip
ſo. That Iudas the traytour hadde
power of god for to do and dyde many
grete myracles / & yet is he dampned.
Alſo doynge of myracles is no
ſyker token of goodneſſe neyther of
the doer ne of the people there as that
they ben done / but oonly charyte and
good lyuynge ben ſyker tokens of godeneſſe.
And therfore Cryſte taught
vs to knowe the good ꝓphetes from
the wycked / not by her myracles ne
by theyr prophecy / but by her good dedes
& charyte. Therby ſayth he men
ſhall knowe that ye be my dyſcyples
yf ye haue charyte amonges you / not
by myracles ne by prophecy. For Iudas

that was ſo holy dyde neuer ſuche

Cryſte badde that we ſholde take
hede to mennes dedes & knowe them
by theyr fruyte. ¶Diues. Ypocrytes
& heretykes do many full good dedes
and yet be they ſhrewes. ¶Pauper.
Suche maner of folke haue two maner
of dedes. Done pryuely / and another
in aperte or openly. Theyr dedes
openly ben not theyrs / but they
ben clothynges of ſheep vnder whiche
they hele them or couer them as wulues
to dyſceyue good ſheep. And therfore
Cryſte byddeth in the goſpell yt
we ſholde beware of falſe prophetes / they
y• come to vs in clothynge of ſhepe

Yf theyr dedes be wycked / it is
her owne clothyng wherby they may
be knowen / but theyr preuy werkes &
theyr preuy techynge ben theyr owne
fruyte whiche comonly ben full wycked.
And ſo by that that they do & teche
pryuely mē may beſt knowe what
they ben. ¶Diues. I may well aſſente
to thy ſpeche / for ſo many wondres
as haue fallen in this londe with
in a fewe yeres / in ſome mone & ſterres
/ in londe & water / in the ayer / y• we
rede in no boke yt euer fell ſo many in
ſo lytyl tyme / & as men ſaye ful wycked
lyuers do many myracles & ꝓphecye

                  . For as moche as the
people is out of charyte and wyll not
knowe the treuthe / but truſte all in leſynges
& in falſhode. Therfore god
ſuffreth falſe ſhrewes for to do wondres
& myracles for to dyſceyue the peple
& to holde them ſtylle in theyr errour.
I haue ſayd as my thynketh / &
ſaye thou forth what thou wylte.

               DIues. What ſayſte thou of
theym that wyll noo ſolempnyte
haue in theyr buryeng / but
be put in erthe anone / and that
that ſholde be ſpente about the buryenge
of theym / they bydde that it
ſholde be gyuen to the poore folke as
blynde and lame. ¶Pauper. Comonly
in ſuche preuy buryenges ben full
ſmalle doles and but lytyll almeſſes
gyuen. And in ſolempne buryenges
ben grete doles and moche almeſſes
gyuen / for moche poore people come
than for to ſyke theyr almeſſe. But
whan that it is done ſo pryuely fewe
men knowe therof / and full fewe poore
people come for to axe almeſſe / for
they knowe not whan ne where ne to
whome they ſholde axe it. And therfore
I byleue ſykerly that ſome falſe
executours that wolde kepe the goodes
all to them ſelfe began fyrſte this
errour and this folye. ¶Diues. And
yet men holde it a grete perfeccyon
now a dayes. ¶Pauper. Though
men burye theyr frendes pryuely or
openly / it is noo harme to the deed
neyther to lyuynge. But yf the worſhyppe
of god be withdrawen / and

the almeſſes of the poore nedy folke / and
the holy prayers and the ſuffragyes
of holy chirche / the whiche ben
ordeyned for to be prayed and done
for the deed folke and the quycke that
haue grete nede therof. But it is a
grete folye and alſo a grete ſynne for
to forſake ſolempne buryenges / that
ben done pryncypally for the worſhyp
of god and for the prouffyte of the dede
folke / ſpendynge theyr goodes to
nedefull releuynge of holy chirche / and
for ye prouffyte of the poore nedy
people that ben of noo power for to
helpe theym ſelfe / for that is a cuſtome
of falſe executours that wolden
make them ſelfe riche with the deed
folkes goodes / and dele it not to the
poore folke after the deed folkes wyll
as now all falſe executours vſe by cuſtome.
And ſo they that forſake worſhypfull
buryenges as I haue reherced
byfore / they lette the prayſyng / the
worſhyp / and the ſacrefyce and offerynges
that ſholde be done to god.
They doo alſo grete deſpyte to holy
chirche / in ſo moche that they forſaken
the prayers and the ſuffragyes of
the holy mynyſtres of holy chirche.
Alſo they offende gretely ayenſt all
the ſoules that ben in purgatory that
ſholde be releued by maſſes ſyngynge
by the prayers and ſuffragyes of holy
chirche / whiche ben ordeyned in the
buryenge of deed folke for the helpe
of all cryſten ſoules. And they pleaſe
the fende y• whiche is full beſy nyght
and daye for to lette goddes offyce / goddes
worſhyppe and holy prayers.
Alſo they offende gretly ayenſt man
kynde / & ayenſt god that toke mankynde
of a woman / in as moche as
they put theyr bodyes in ſuche dſpyte
and pryue or take it of the due worſhyppe.
For the bodye of a good man
or of a good woman that is knytte to
that precyoꝰ ſoule that Cryſte bought
ſo dere with his precyous blood / with
whiche ſoule it ſhal aryſe ayen at the
daye of dome / and ſhall lyue in blyſſe
without ende bryghter than y• ſonne
/ it is of a full grete dygnyte / all yf
it be here in grete myſchyef for a tyme
for Adams ſynne. Mannes bodye
is of full grere dygnyte in that / that
god toke our bodye of a woman allone
/ and bycame man without parte
of man / and bodely in our kynde reygneth
god and man aboue all creatures.
And therfore by waye of kynde
and for worſhyp of god that toke our
kynde / it ought for to be worſhypped / namely
in his deth / for than is ther
no drede of pryde. And therfore ſayth
the wyſe man Eccle .vij. Mortuo non
prohibeas graciam. Withdrawe not
thy grace and thy mercy from the
deed. That is to ſaye / withdrawe not
ne lette not the due ſeruyce and worſhypfull
Ceremonyes that longen to
the bodyes / ne the ſuffrages and prayers
that longen to the ſoules / as the
gloſe ſayth. And in an other place he
ſayth thus. Sone wepe thou for the
deed man with bytter teres and grete
ſorowe / and after his aſtate as right
is hele his bodye / deſpyſe not his buryenge
/ make mornynge one daye or
two after his deſeruynge Eccleſiaſti.
xxxviij. For by the lawe of kynde / by

the lawe wryten / by the lawe of grace
/ and euery tyme worſhypfull ſepulture
after mennes power hath be due
dette to mannes bodye and womannes.
In the lawe of kynde haue we
example of Abraham Yſaac and Iacob
/ and her wyues / whiche hadde full
coſtely buryenges. As we rede in holy
wryte Gen̄. lvi. And in the lawe wryten
haue we example of Samuell.
Dauyd. Salomon. Ioſaphat. Ezechye.
Ioſye. Tobye / and of the Machabeys
/ whoſe buryenges were coſtly
& worſhypfully. In the lawe of grace
/ that is in the newe lawe haue we
example of our lorde Iheſu Cryſte / whiche
not withſtandynge how well
he ſuffred ſpytefull deth for mankynde
/ yet he wolde haue and hadde worſhypful
and coſtely ſepulture and buryenge.
As we fynde in the goſpell.
Iohannes .xix. Wherby as the gloſe
ſayth / there he gaue men example to
kepe worſhypfull buryenge after the
cuſtome of the contree. And therfore
he cōmended Marye magdaleyn / that
ſhe came byfore his dethe to anoynte
his bodye ſo precyouſly and ſo coſtely
in to the ſepulture. And many ſayntes
were buryed worſhypfully by the doynges
of angellys / as ſaynt Clement
ſaynt Katheryne / ſaynt Agathe / and
many other. And ſaynt Poule the fyrſte
hermyte was buryed worſhypfully
and wonderly by werkynge of lyons
and of wylde beſtes / in tokenynge yt
mannes bodye & womānes ought to
haue worſhypful ſepulture / for ſythen
angellys and wylde beſtes dyde ſuche
worſhypp to mannes bodye after his
deth. Moche more mankynde ſholde
worſhyppe mannes bodye after his
deth / and doo worſhyp to his owne
kynde. And ſo men ſholde releue poore
folke in theyr myſchyef / and ſpecyally
in theyr deynge by almes gyuynge.
But they ſholde not for that doo
ony wronge by theyr lyuyng to theyr
euen cryſten for to make them riche
for to do moche almeſſe at theyr endynge.
For as ye lawe ſayth / ther ſholde
no man be made riche with wronge
& harme of an other. Locupletari

               DIues. What ſayſte thou of
theym that holde markettes
and feyres in holy chirche &
in ſanctuarye. ¶Pauper. Bothe the
byer and the ſeller and the men of holy
chirche that mayntene them or ſuffre
them whan that they myght lette
it ben accurſed. For we fynde not that
euer Cryſte punyſſhed ſoo harde ony
ſynne whyles that he wente here in
erthe / as he dyde byeng and ſellynge
in goddes houſe as we fynde Io .xi.
On a tyme he came in to the temple
of Iheruſalem / and there he founde
men byeng & ſellynge oxen and ſheep
& douues to be offred in the temple / and
chaungers of moneye alſo to be
offred in the temple. He was hyghely
offended / and made a ſcourge & bette
them out of the temple / and ſayd to
theym in this wyſe. Myne houſe ſholde
be an houſe of prayers / and ye haue
made it a denne of theues. Bere

ye out ſayd he this marchaūdyſe. Lede
hens theſe beſtes and make ye not
my fads houſe an houſe of marchaū
                  dyſe
and a denne of theues. And as
ſaynt Mathew telleth & other goſpellers
/ he drewe downe her bothes / and
ouertourned theyr ſtalles and theyr
ſetes and ſhedde theyr moneye. And
as ſaynt Marke ſayth / he wolde not
ſuffre no veſſell that was not longynge
to y• temple for to be borne through
the temple. And ſythen Cryſte wolde
not ſuffre thynges to be ſolde in the
temple / that was only for the worſhyp
of god & helpe of the temple. Moche
more he wyll not ſuffre thynges to be
ſolde in the temple that longeth not
to the temple / but oonly to ſeculers.
¶Diues. Sythen god was ſo offended
for that men ſolde therin yt that
was nedefull to the temple / and for
eaſement of them that came fro ferre
contrees / what ſholde he haue done
yf he had foūde them byeng & ſellynge
thynges of ſeculers. Or yf he had
foūde theym in bacbytynge & glotony
/ dronkenſhyp / lecherye / in ſonge &
ſpeche of rybaudrye / as men vſe now
a dayes in holy chirche. ¶Pauper.
Saynt Auſtyn ſayth / that as he troweth
he ſholde haue caſte them to the
pytte of helle. ¶Diues. How myght
Cryſte that was ſo poore a man haue
caſte out ſuche a multytude of people
It is a wondre that they withſtoden
hym not. ¶Pauper. For as the gloſe
ſayth / ther came ſuche a lyght out of
his face by waye of his godhode as lō
                  ge
as he wolde that they were all aferde
of the ſyght of his face & fledde
awaye. And for the ſame cauſe in tyme
of his paſſyon whan they came
for to take hym / he ſayd I am he that
ye ſeke / twyes they wente bacwarde / &
for drede felle downe to the groū
                  de.
¶Diues. Why ſayd he that they
made his houſe a denne of theues.
¶Pauper. For who ſo is about for
to begyle ony man or woman of his
good / he is a theef. And in byeng and
ſellynge eyther of them is about for to
begyle other / & in that they ben theues.
And for that they do it in goddes
houſe & ther caſte in theyr herte how
pryuely and how ſlyghely they may
begyle her euen cryſten / therfore they
make goddes houſe a denne of theues.
And comonly in ſuche feyres &
markettes where ſo euer it be holden / there
ben many theues mychers and
cutte purces. ¶Diues. And I drede
me that ful often by ſuche feyres goddes
houſe is made a tauerne of glotones
/ & a bordell of lechours. For the
marchaūtes and chapmen kepe there
with theym theyr wyues & lēmannes
both nyght & daye. ¶Pauper. And
yf ony man comyne there fleſſhely
with his wyfe or his lēmen / the chirche
& the chirche yerde alſo ben pollute.
And yf it myght be preued / ther
ſholde noo preeſte ſynge ne ſaye noo

it were recoūſeylled ayen by the byſſhop.

¶Pauper. What

the ſeconde cōmaundement god byddeth
that we ſholde not take his name
in vayne / for who ſo doth ſhall be
gylty & ſhall not paſſe vnpunyſſhed.
¶Pauper. In thre maners goddes
name is taken in vayne. That is by
myſlyuynge / by myſpeche / & by myſhe
rynge. Fyrſte by myſlyuynge / for whā
man or woman is cryſtened / there he
forſaketh the fende & all his werkes / and
his lordſhypp / whan his godfader
and his godmoder anſweren for
hym ſayeng. Abrenuncio. That is to
ſaye. I forſake. And there he knytteth
hym to Cryſte / & maketh couenaunt

with hym for to be his true ſeruaunt
without ende. And there he taketh
the name of Cryſte vpon hym and be
cometh cryſten. For all cryſten poeple
is named after Cryſte / and he is our
pryncypall godfader. For cryſten cometh
of Cryſte / and ſo all cryſten people
bere y• name of Cryſte vpon them
And ſo in as moche as we ben called
cryſten and goddes people / in that we
bere the name of god vpon vs. And
therfore ſayth the prophete. Tu in nobis

not. But yf it be ſo / that we lyue not
after our name that we haue taken
of Cryſte / ne lyue not as cryſten menne
as goddes ſeruauntes / but forſake
hym and torne ayen to the fende and
lyue not as cryſten folke / but as Iewes

not. And as ſayth ſaynt Poule

wycked dedes and theyr wycked lyuynge
forſaken god. And therfore all
wycked lyuers / and namely ypocrytes
that beren the name of holyneſſe

that they ben the fendes ſeruauntes / they
take goddes name in vayne / &

therfor Cryſte ſayth to ſuche wycked

               ALſo goddes name is taken in

that in many wyſe. Fyrſte by
namynge of goddes name in vayne / in
tales tellynge / in Iapery / in ſcorne
for in ſuche vanyte goddes name ſholde
not be named. ¶Diues. Telle ſome
enſample. ¶Pauper. As yf one
ſayd to ye in ſcorne whan he is wroth
with the / god make the a good man.
And ſome ſaye of an other in ſcorne / that
god hath forſaken him / & Iapers
& dyce players comonly name goddes
name in vayne in this maner / though
they ſwere none othe. And all ſuche
take goddes name in ydleneſſe / that
teche ony errours or hereſyes ayenſte
the fayth and ayenſt god / or preche or
teche the treuthe oonly for couetyſe / or
for enuye / or for vayne glorye / and
not for helthe of mannes ſoule / ne for
worſhyp of god. And therfore the prophete
ſayth thus. Peccatori autē dixit

et aſſumis teſtamentū meum peros
tuum. God ſayth to the ſynfull

man / why telleſt thou my rightfulneſſes
/ and takeſte my teſtament and
my lawe by thy mouth / & ſo ofte nameſte
my name. For all tho that teche
well & ſpeke well and wyl not do
therafter / they take goddes name in
vayne. Alſo goddes name is taken in
vayne by curſynge and ſwerynge / as
whan men or wymen in wrath or elles
in nyce myrthe ſaye to an other / god
gyue the myſchaūce / god gyue the
euyll grace / euyl deth. Alſo it is taken
in vayne oftymes by vowes makyng
and that in dyuerſe maner. Fyrſte yf
man make ony vowes to ony creature.
For vowes makynge is a dyuyne
worſhyp that ought to be done only
to god and to no creature. And therfore
the prophete ſayth. Vouete et reddite
dn̄o deo veſtro. Make ye your vowes
to our lorde god / & yeldeth them
to hym. Alſo it is taken in vayne
whan that the people kepe not theyr
vowes that ben lefull / but breke them
retcheleſly or wylfully / or by freylte
without nede and without auctoryte
of theyr ſoueraynes / whiche haue power
for to dyſpenſe them or to chaū
                  ge
theyr vowes. Alſo yf men make
vowes vnlefull ayenſt charyte / and to
doo ony thynge ayenſt goddes lawe.
As yf thou madeſt a vowe for to ſlee
thyn euen cryſten / or that yu ſholdeſte
neuer do good to poore men / for perauēture
ſome poore man hath aggreued
the. Alſo whan men make vowes
vnwyſely lyghtly without auyſement
and by comon cuſtome of ſpeche.

               DIues. And ſuche vowes ben
made now a dayes full many.
For with moche folke be
they ones ſpoken / they ben no more
thought on / for they ben ſo comon in
theyr mouth. ¶Pauper. Therfore
they ſynne full greuouſly / ſo takynge
goddes name in vayne. For ther ſholde
no vowe be made but for a thynge
of charyte and with a good auyſemente.
We fynde in holy wryte Iuducum

leder & a Iuge of goddes people / whoſe
name was Iept. And whan he
ſholde go for to fyght ayenſt goddes
enemyes the people of Amon / he made
his vowe to god that yf he gaue to

he cam home ayen what lyuyng thynge
he mette fyrſte of his houſholde in
his comynge home / he ſholde ſlee it &
offre it vp to god in ſacrefyce. After
this as god wolde he had the vyctory
and came home with grete worſhyp / whan
his doughter herde theſe tydynges
ſhe was full gladde and toke her
tymber in her honde & came in gre

he loued her full well. Alas doughter
alas ſayd he / what haſte thou done
/ why comeſt thou ſo ſoone ayenſt
me. I haue opened my mouth to god
and haue made a vowe ayenſt the / for
I muſte by my auowe ſlee the and

offre the vp in to ſacrefyce to god.
But the woman his doughter yet clene
mayden was ſo gladde of goddes
worſhyp & of her faders worſhyp / &
that goddes enemyes were ſo ſlayne / that
ſhe made lytyll ſorowe or none
for her deth & ſayd to her fader Iept
Sythen yu haſte made ſuche a vowe, &
god hath ſente the vyctorye of his enmyes

came ayen to her fader Iept / & mekely
ſuffred the deth for goddes ſake

                  e that yt womās deth
whiche was a clene mayden betokeneth
Cryſtes paſſyon. For right as ſhe
toke the deth wylfully for ſaluacōn of
goddes folke / and deſtruccōn of goddes
enemyes. So Cryſte a clene mayden
yt neuer was defouled with ſynne
/ and neuer dyde amys / he ſuffred
wylfully bytter deth for ſaluacyon of
all mankynde & deſtruccōn of the fendes
power. ¶Diues. Was not his vowe
lefull. ¶Pauper. It was not lefull.
For by his vowe yf he had fyrſte
mette with a catte or an hounde comynge
ayenſt hym / he ſholde haue
made ſacrefyce to god therof / whiche
ſacrefyce ſholde haue ben abhomynacōn
to god / for neyther was able to be
offred in ſacrefyce. And for as moche
as he made his vowe ſo vnwyſely / god
ſuffred hȳ to falle in to that myſchyef
to ſlee an Innocent his owne doughter
ayenſt goddes lawe. For god ſayth
Innocentē et iuſtū nō occides. Thou
ſhalt not ſlee the Innocent ne ye right
full man ne woman. And ſo by his
vowe ſo folyſly made he dyde ful grete
dedely ſynne / and forfeted full hyghely

ſayth the mayſtre of the ſtoryes
and Ioſephus alſo that he was a foole
in his vowe makynge and wycked
& ouer cruelly done in the fulfyllynge.
And therfore ſayth the grete clerke

In the vowe ſayth he that is foule &

               DIues. I aſſente / ſaye forth
I praye the. ¶Pauper. Alſo
goddes name is taken in
vayne by blaſphemye and ſpytefull
ſpeche of god / as whan that men grutche
ayenſt goddes domes in ſekeneſſe

trybulacyons and dyſeaſe / and ſaye
that god is vnrightfull and cruell or
grutched ayenſt his mercy whan they
may not haue vengeaūce of theyr aduerſaryes
as they wolde haue it / and
ſaye that god is to pacyent & to mercyable.
And they alſo that fallen in
wanhope / ſayen that god wyll not
forgyue theym theyr ſynne. And they
alſo that preſume to moche of goddes
mercy & wyll not amende theym
for they ſaye that god wyll forgyue it
theym at the fyrſte worde. Alſo ſome
ſaye that god ſlepeth whan he helpeth
theym not as they wolde haue it
All they that ſpeke thus or ſaye ony
other thynge of god & that is ayenſt
his worſhyp & his godhode / they take
goddes name in vayne by blaſphemy
Alſo goddes name is taken amys &
in vayne by euyll ſpeche of othes ſwetynge.
For who ſo wyll lyghtly ſwere
for a thynge of nought or of no charge
/ or cuſtomably or falſely / and wote
well that he ſwereth falſe / or dyſpyteouſly
/ or dyſceyuable / or ſwereth
by ony creatures / or vſeth ony nyce othes
/ or vnlefull othes / all theſe take
goddes name in vayne. For there
ought noo man ne woman to ſwere
but for a treuthe of charge / and whan
it nedeth for to ſwere to wytneſſe of
treuthe. And whan a man ſhall ſwere
he ſhall ſwere by his god & by noo
creature. ¶Diues. Moche folke is ſo
brought in cuſtome of ſwerynge / that
vnnethe they can ſpeke thre wordes
togydre but they ſwere by god or by
ſome creature / or ſome grete or nyce

cuſtome excuſeth not ſynne but it
accuſeth and aggregeth ſynne. And
therfore it is to drede yt they yt ſwere
ſo cuſtomably & ſoo lyghtly that they
ſynne dedely yf they ſwere ſoth or falſe.
And therfore Salomon ſayth. Iuracioni

For god ſayth that who ſo taketh his

ſwere for I ſwere ſoth. Some ſaye but
I ſwere ther wyll no man byleue me.
¶Pauper. Theſe ben no excuſacōns
but greuous accuſacōns & grutchynges
of ſynne. For as for y• fyrſte poynte
it is falſe / for ſuche falſe ſwerers
loue not theyr god / for they kepe not
his cōmaundement / and they haue
hym full lytyll in mynde / and ſwere
many horryble othes in vanyte and
ſhrewedneſſe bycauſe of myſuſe whan
they thynke not on god / and therfore
that excuſacōn is but an open ſcorne
& a grete blaſphemynge to god. For
yf thy ſeruaunt hadde done a thynge
that thou haddeſt hym forboden / the
ofter that he dyde it the worſe thou
woldeſte be payed. And yf he ſcorned
the & ſayd that he dyde it for thy loue
for to haue y• in mynde / thou woldeſt
holde it a full grete ſcorne & ben moche
more an angred with hym / namely
yf thou ware his lyege lorde & his
kyng. Moche more than god that is
lorde & kyng of all thynges is an angred
with them that ſo ſwere ayenſte
his cōmaundement / & excuſe them ſo
ſcornfully ſaynge yt they do it to haue
god in mynde. And therfore it is for
to drede yt they ſhalbe put out of mynde
amonge goddes choſen people / for
Cryſte complayneth hym of ſuche folke

For he that forſwereth wyttyngly the

In .vij. caſes clerkes & lewde
folke may ſwere lefully. Fyrſte for
to ſaue man or woman from harme
of theyr bodye / and fro leſynge of his
good whan y• treuthe can none other

of peas. Alſo for to kepe fayth and
treuthe amonge mankynde. Alſo for
to kepe obedyence and ordynall ſubgeccyon
of the ſubgettes to theyr ſoueraynes.
Alſo for to ſaue fredom of

And in euery othe men muſte haue

a dyſcrete auyſemēt er he ſwere / that
he ſwere not but treurhe / and for nede
that he to whome he ſwereth wyll
not ellys byleue hym in thynges of

Yf it be a treuthe of charge right profytable
to be byleued / & men wyl not

it is leful to y• to ſwere as I haue ſayd
But yf it be a thyng of no charge nenedefull

nomore byleue the for thyn othe than
they do without othe / and wyſe men
wyl the leſſe byleue the for thyn othes
For comonly grete ſwerers & vſaunt
ſwerers ben full falſe. ¶Diues. Why
ſo. ¶Pauper. For in that they take
goddes name ſo vayne / they ben falſe
to god in theyr ſwerynge. And ſythen
they ben falſe to god in theyr
ſwerynge / they gyue lytyll tale for to
be falſe to man or womā in theyr ſwerynge

And therfore yf yu wylt that men byleue

worſhyp goddes name and be true to

byleue the redely without ony othe
Doo ſoo and ſpeke of that than men

And yf thou be varyenge and vntruſty

But this is the Englyſſhe. I ſaye

                  Caplm .vij.
               DIues. Why forbedeth Cryſte
men for to ſwere by creatures
¶Pauper. Ther is two maner
of ſwerynge. One is takynge of
wytneſſe of a thynge that a man ſwereth
by / & ſo it is not lefull for to ſwere
by ony creature. For ſaynt Poule
ſayth. Hoīes ꝑ maiorē ſuū iurant. ad
Hebre .vi. Men ſwere ſayth he by theyr
more / that is to ſaye by hym that is
more of credence & of reuerence than
they ben them ſelfe. But only god is
more in dygnyte and more in ordre of

kynde than man / for he is bothe god
and man. And therfore he wyll that
we take in ſwerynge no wytneſſe but
only of hym / for he is ſouerayne treuthe.
And therfore ſuche maner ſwerynge
is a dyuyne worſhyp that longeth
oonly to god and to no creature. For
god wyll that whan men may haue
no wytneſſe of treuthe that is nedefull
and prouffytable to be byleued / that
they take hym to wytneſſe and
ſwere by hym as by ſouerayne treuth
and by no creature. For ſuche maner
ſwerynge is a dyuyne worſhypp that
longeth to god and to no creature. As
the gloſe ſayth Mathei. v. ſuꝑ illud.
Non ꝑiurabis. And as ſaynt Auſtyn
ſayth in the ſame place. Who ſo ſwereth
by ony creature / he ſwereth by
god that made yt creature. And therfore
Cryſte badde y• men ſholde ſwere
by no creatures / for yf they do lyghtly
they fall in double ſynne / both in ydolatry
& in periury. Fyrſte in ydolatry
for the worſhyp that longeth only to
god / they do it to creatures. Alſo they
falle of
                     •
                  e ſo in periury / for men drede
leſſe to lye & to forſwere them whan
they ſwere by creatures / than whan
they ſwere by god allone.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .viij.
               AN other maner ſwerynge is
by execracyon & imprecacōn / that
is whan man or woman
in theyr ſwerynge prayeth openly or
pryuely ayenſt hym ſelfe / or ayenſt ony
thynge that he loueth / or ony other
thyng but it be as he ſayth. And thus
ſome man ſwereth by his hede / ſome
man by his thedame. For as ſaynt
Auſtyn ſayth / he that ſwereth ſoo he
byndeth hym ſelfe & leyeth his hede &
his thedame in plegge to god / & prayeth
to god that he leeſe his hede & his
thedame & neuer thryue but it be as
he ſayth / or but he do as he ſayth or
behoteth. Some ſwere by theyr ſoule / by
theyr chaffre & by all the goodes
that they haue / & ſo bynde theym to
leſe theyr ſoule / theyr chaffre / and all
theyr goodes / & bynde theyr ſoule to
the fyre of helle without ende but it
be as they ſaye. Some ſwere by theyr
fader & moders ſoules / & ſo as moche
as they may they bynde theyr fader &
moders ſoules to the paynes of helle
without ende but it be as they ſaye / or
but they do as they byhoten. Some in
theyr ſwerynge praye openly ayenſt
themſelfe / as whan they ſaye ſo helpe
me god. There they forſake the helpe
of god but it be as they ſaye. Som
ſaye ellys the deuyll brenne me / god
gyue me ellys myſchaūce / and ſuche
other. And of this maner ſwerynge is
that ſolempne othes that men make
in dome and out of dome / whan men
ſaye / ſo helpe me god at the holy dome
/ or ellys ſo helpe me god & the holy
dome. In this othe men forſake
the helpe of god & of our lady / & of al
the company of heuen at the daye of
dome but it be ſoo as they ſaye. And
ouer that yf they ſwere falſe they calle
god to wytneſſe of a thynge that is
falſe / and ſayen that god whoſe name
is treuth bereth them wytneſſe of
a thynge that is falſe. And ſoo they
lye on god & doo hym grete velonye / 

for he was neuer falſe wytneſſe ne neuer
ſhall be. For he is ſouerayne treuthe
that not dyſceyueth / ne may not
be dyſceyueth. And that ſhall theſe
falſe ſwerers fele at the daye of dome
but they amende them. ¶Diues.
Why lay men theyr hondes on the boke
whan they ſhall ſwere byfore a Iuge.
¶Pauper. For that men ſholde
charge theyr othe the more / for whan
he layeth his honde on the booke / he
forſaketh all the fayth of holy chirche
/ and all the holy prayers wryten

he forſaketh all the Ioyes of heuen
wryten in the boke / and byndeth hym
to all the paynes wryten in the booke
but it be as he ſayth. And in that
he layeth his honde on the booke in
his ſwerynge / he forſaketh all the gode
dedes that euer he dyde or euer he
ſhall doo but it be ſothe that he ſwereth.
For in holy wryte by the hondes
ben vnderſtonden werkes. And that
he ſwereth ſoo with his mouth / and
kyſſeth the booke / he forſaketh all
holy prayers and good wordes that
euer he ſpake with his mouth or euer

forſworen. And for to couple or knytte
to gydre god and the holy dome in

yf they ſwere ſuche othes not for dyſceyte

they ſynne full greuouſly yf they ben

And yf a man be compelled to ſwere
he ſhal ſwere by his god and by none
ſuche nyce othes. Moreouer my frende
whan that a man ſwereth by his
cap / or by his hode / or by ony ſuche
other / eyther he ſwereth ſoo by waye
of wytneſſe takyng or by waye of execraccyon.
Yf he ſwere ſoo by waye of

by his better. And he offendeth god

only to god he doth it to his hode.
For as ſwerynge to bere wytneſſe
is a dyuyne worſhyp that longeth only
to god. And yf he ſwere by his hode
by waye of execracyon / ſo that he
muſt leſe his hode but he ſaye ſoth / it
is an ouer ſcornefull othe / for it is no

For the fende tempteth them leſſe / &
to the leſſe ſynne for to holde theym
ſtylle in y• gretter / & ſo to drawe other
to the ſame ſynne yt they perceyue it
not. For it is more ſynne to robbe god
of his worſhyp / than to robbe a man
of his catell. But ſuche as ſwere by
theyr hode do dyuyne worſhyp to ther
hode & take it from god / & make other
to do more worſhyp to theyr hode
than to goddes holy name. And
ofte ſuche ſwerers kepe treuth in ſmale

greter is the ſynne and the periurye / as
the lawe ſayth. And it is more ſynne
a man for to forſwere hym by god

ſynne than by ony creature. ¶Diues

But it is not lefull to a cryſten man
for to ſtyre hym ſo to ſwere. Example
we haue of this Gen̄ .xxxi. Where Laban

by reaſon. For yf her huſbonde haue
no pyte of nedy people than ſhe may
make auowe to gyue to poore people
to yt pleaſaūce of god after her power
ſauynge theyr bothe aſtate. ¶Diues.
Whether is it more medefull to do a
good dede with auowe or without auowe.
¶Pauper. With auowe / for a
vowe makynge is one of the hygheſt
worſhyp that man may do. Quia eſt
actus latrie. Alſo by auowe man meketh
hym mooſt to god / & gyueth to
god the mooſt gyfte that he can gyue
that is his free wyl. Alſo he gyueth a
greter gyfte that gyueth the tree with
fruyte / than he that gyueth the fruyte
& reſerueth to hym the tree. Alſo by a
vowe mannes wyl is more ſtabled in
goodneſſe. Neuertheleſſe for as moche
as man and woman ben full frayle
and chaūgeable / therfore men ſholde
not make auowes but fewe & with a
good auyſement. For brekynge of auowes
is a grete dyſhonour to god.
¶Diues. What yf a man make a

vowe oonly vnder condycōn. ¶Pauper.
Yf the condycōn falle or be / he is
bounde / ellys not. And yf a man bynde
hym by dyuerſe cauſes / yf ther one
falle he is bounden though the other
fallen not. As yf I made ony auowe
for to go to ſaynt Iames in hope to
fynde there my brother / & alſo to haue
redempcōn of my ſynnes / though I
wyſte afterwarde certaynly ye I ſholde
not fynde my brother there / yet I were
boūde to go thyder for y• other cauſe.
¶Diues. For how many cauſes is
a man or woman vnboūde from his
auowe. ¶Pauper. For four cauſes.
Fyrſte yf the pryncypall cauſe of his
auowe makynge fayle. As yf a man
make auowe to faſte all yt ſatyrdayes
to haue helth of his childe / yf the childe
amende not / he is not boūde therto.
Alſo yf it be made vnder condycyon
that is not ne falleth not. Alſo yf
his ſouerayne vnbynde hym therof.
Alſo yf he haue no power for to kepe
it. ¶Diues. Than yf a mayden make
an auowe to lyue in maydenhode
all her lyfe durynge / yf ſhe be corrupte
& leſe her maydēhode / ſhe is vnboū
                  de
from her auowe / for ſhe can no lenger
lyue in maydenhode. ¶Pauper.
All yf ſhe can no lenger lyue in maydenhode
/ yet ſhe is boūde to contynence
all her lyfe / & to kepe her auowe in
as moche as ſhe may. And ſo it is of
other auowes that men may not all
do / for they ben boūde to do all that
they may do. Moreouer ye ſhall vnderſtonde
that ſome auowe is of nede
as the auowe that we make in bapty
me / for to forſake the fende / & to kepe
the fayth of holy chirche. And other
auowes of free wyll / as whan a man
byndeth hym frely to do a good dede
without whiche he may be ſaued / as
faſtynge / contynence / & pylgremage.
Two thynges be nedefull in chaungynge
of auowe. Rightfull cauſe / &
auctoryte of the ſouerayns. In dyſpen
ſacyon of the auowe of abſtynence or
ſuche other / it muſte be taken hede to
the richeſſes or to the pouerte of y• perſone.
For a poore man in caas ought
to haue as moche dyſpenſacōn for a
peny or for right nought / as a grete
lorde for an hondred marke. Some
condycōns ben vnderſtonden in auowes
though a man ſaye them not / as
I ſhall do yf I lyue and yf god wyll.
Other condicōns ben more ſpecyal / as
I ſhal vyſyte ſaynt Thomas yf I go
in to kent. By bothe maners of theſe
condicōns yf they fayle man in excuſed
of his auowe yf it ſtande all in yt
condycōn. The huſbonde may not entre
in to relygyon / but his wyfe make
fyrſte auowe of perpetuell cōtynence.
Neyther the wyfe ne ye huſbonde may
make auowe of cōtynence without others
aſſente. Solempne auowe of cō
                  tynence
letteth matrymony to do or to
be done. Yf it be not ſolempne / yf the
perſone wedde yt matrymony holdeth
He muſte paye the dette of his bodye
to his wyfe / but he may not axe it of
her. Solempne auowe is made by takynge
of holy ordre / or by entre in to
relygyon. Though a man or woman
breke his faſte bycauſe of ſekeneſſe / he
breketh not his abſtynēce. Extra li.v.

boūde to kepe this othe / and not ellys
¶Diues. Yf childern ſwere to doo a
thyng leful whyle they be within age
may theyr fader & moder reuoke that
othe. ¶Pauper. Fader and moder
and his tutour may reuoke the childerens
othes & theyr vowes as ſoone
as they knowe therof. And ſo may
the huſbonde of his wyfe / and ſhe is
boūde to obeye his reuocacōn. But yf
they go forth whan they wote therof.
& reuoke it not at the begynnynge / afterwarde

               DIues. whether is periury more
ſynne or manſlaughter.
¶Pauper. Periury is more.
For as ſaynt Poule ſayth ad Hebr .vi.
Men ſholde ſwere by theyr better and
theyr gretter / & of euery contrauerſy / that
is to ſaye of euery cauſe that is
in debate to conferme the true parte / the
laſte ende is an othe. For euery ſuche
cauſe is termyned & ended by an
othe. And ſythen it is ſo that the cauſe
of manſlaughter & of euery open
ſynne touchynge mannes dome muſte
be termyned by an othe. Periurye
muſte be taken for a paſſynge ſynne
and ſoo it is. For who ſoo forſwereth
hym wyttyngly he forſaketh his god
& therfore periury is the greteſt ſynne
of all ſynnes next ydolatrye / for it is
ayenſt the ſeconde cōmaundement / &
inmedyatly ayenſt god / & in deſpyte
& forſakyng of god. But manſlaughter
is inmedyatly ayenſt man. And
though man with manſlaughter greued
god full ſore / yet he forſaketh not
god ne deſpyſeth hȳ / ne dyſhonoureth
hym ſo moche as he doth by periury.
And as yt phyloſophre ſayth. In princi.•
meta.• Amonges hethen men othe
hath euer be worſhypfull. For euery
ſecte Iewe Saraſyn Paynym fleeth to
ſwere falſely by his goddes name as
mooſt inconuenyent / & yf māſlaughter
were more ſynne than periury / it
were but a folye to trye the cauſe of
manſlaughter by an othe. For it is ſemely
that he that was not aferde to
do the grete ſynne of manſlaughter / ſholde
lytyll drede to falle in yt ſynne
of periury yf it were leſſe. And thus
ſayth ſaynt Thomas in qōe d qðlibe
et Io. in ſū .li.i. ti. .q̄ .xxiiij. vt

                  . ¶Diues.
Yf all men charged periury and
falſe othes as yu doſt / many man had
ben hanged & drawen and ſlayne in
otherwyſe that yet lyue & fare wel. It
is full harde ſo lyghtly to ſlee a man
with a worde whan his lyfe may be

ſaued with a worde / for a man coſteth
full moche or he come to be a man.
¶Pauper. Therfore men ſholde beſyly
flee periurye and falſe othes. For
ther is no thynge that cauſeth ſo moche
manſlaughter and ſhedynge of
blood as periury doth. ¶Diues. She
we me that I praye the yf thou can.
¶Pauper. Salomon ſayth Eccle .x.
The kyngdome is fletted and chaū
                  ged
fro nacyon to nacyon for wronges
/ vnrightfulnes / and deſpytes done
to goddes name in dyuerſe gyles.
But periury is cauſe of all falſe domes
and wronges / and of all vnright
fulneſſe / cauſe of gyle and of treaſon
and of grete dyſpytes that ben done
to god and man. For as I ſayd fyrſte
Euery cauſe muſte be ended by wytneſſes
or by queſtes / the whiche ben
ſworen to ſaye treuth / and alſo by a
Iuge whiche is ſworen to god and to
the kyng for to deme rightful domes
And yf they that ben charged for to
ſaye the treuth gyue none anſwere to
forſwere them and to lye / they ſhall
dyſceyue the Iuge / and do hym gyue
a falſe dome. Suche periurers robbe
men of theyr good / & dyſhereted moche
folke. They ſaue ſtronge theues / &
ſlee true men. Suche robbe folke of
theyr good name / ſuche ben falſe to
god / to the kyng / & to prelates of holy
chirche. Suche ben cauſe that this
londe is in poynte to be loſte & to be
chaūged to an other nacyon & in to a
newe tongue. And that may not be
without ſhedynge of moche blood &
manſlaughter. And ſo periury is cauſe
of moche manſlaughter. Alſo periurye
is cauſe that we haue ſoo many
theues and manquellers in this londe
/ for they hope alwaye to be ſaued
by periury and falſhode of queſtmongers
yt for a lytyl good wyll forſwere
them. And therfore in hope of periury
they ben ſo bolde in theyr ſynne to robbe
ſlee & brenne / for though they ben
taken yet they hope to ſcape by periury.
And yf they were ſyker that ther
wolde no man ne womā forſwere hȳ
to ſaue them / they wolde neuer be ſoo
bolde to ſynne / & all other ſholde be y•
more aferde to ſynne / yf they wyſte
wel that true dome ſholde paſſe with
out periury. Suche ſynfull wretches
as the ꝓphete Yſaye ſayth .xxiij. they
haue put theyr hope all in leſynges &
in ꝓiury / & by leſynges falſhode & periury
ben they mayntened & not chaſty
ſed. Alſo it is a ſynne ayenſt kynde to
ſaue a theef in dyſpyte of god / whoſe
name they forſwere ayenſt his cōmaū
                  dement.
For he byddeth that ther ſholde
no man take his name in vayne.
Alſo he ſayth. Non ſuſcipies vocem
mendacij. nec iunges manū vt ꝓ impio
dicas falſū teſtimoniū. Exo .xxiij.
Thou ſhalte not take the voyce of
leſynges / ne Ioyne thyn honde in makynge
of couenaunt to bere ony falſe
wytneſſe for the wycked man to ſaue
them. Maleficos nō pacieris viuere.
Exodi .xxij. Thou ſhalte not ſuffre
wytches and open malefactours neyther
felones a lyue / but ſlee theym in
chaſtyſynge of other. Slee one & ſaue
many one. Alſo this is a ſynne ayenſt
kynde & ouer grete folye / a man
to ſlee his owne ſoule without ende

to ſaue a theef that neuer wolde doo
hym a good tourne / but alwaye redy
to robbe hȳ & perauenture to ſlee hȳ
whan he may. It is a grete folye to
offende god by periury to pleſe a theef
a manqueller that offendeth god & al
the contree Suche ben lyke the Iewes
that ſaued Barrabam y• ſtronge theef
& manqueller / & ſlewe ſwete Iheſu ſouerayne
treuth that neuer dyde amys
And as holy doctours tellen yt a man
ſholde rather ſuffre the mooſt dyſpytous
deth of bodye than he ſholde for
ſwere him or do ony dedely ſynne. Moche
more he ſholde not forſwere hym
ne do no dedely ſynne to ſaue a theues
lyfe that god & londes lawe cōmaūde
to ſlee. It felle late in this londe that
a Scotte appeled an Englyſſhe man
of hygh treaſon / whan he ſholde fyghte
byfore a Iuge in theyr cauſe / the Iuge
as the maner is put them both to
theyr othe / whan the Scotte ſholde
ſwere he ſayd to the Iuge. Lorde I came
not hyder to ſwere I cam to fyght
for my chalenge was to fyght / & therto
I am redy / but ſwere wyll I not / for
I made no chalenge to ſwere The
Iuge ſayd that but yf he wolde ſwere
that his appele was true / ellys he ſholde
be taken as a cōuycte and a taynt
traytour / and be hanged & drawen
without fyghtynge. And ſo he was / for
he wolde not ſwere wyttynge wel
that his appele was falſe / and made
only for malyce as he knowleched er

                     •
                  e deyed. This man myght haue
ſworen / and happely haue hadde the
better of his aduerſarye and eſcaped
the deth with grete worſhypp in this
worlde. But yet he had leuer to deye
dyſpytefully than for to do dyſpyte to
goddes name / to ſwere falſe therby / &
leuer to deye bodely than to do that
periury to god & ſlee his owne ſoule.
For he helde it as it is a gretter ſynne
than manſlaughter. And though
he wolde auenge hȳ on man for rancour
of herte / yet on god he wolde not
venge hym by periury. And ſo god ſaued
them both fro periury & māſlaughter
& gaue them grace to dey in charyte
& make amendes to god & man.

               DIues. Sythen periury is ſo
grete a ſynne. What payne is
ordeyned therto by the lawe.
¶Pauper. As the lawe ſayth .xxij. q̄.
.i. p̄dicandū. Aſmoche penaūce ſholde
be enioyned for periury / as for manſlaughter
& auoutry. And they ſholde
neuer more be taken to ſwere or to bere
wytneſſe in ony dome / but ſhall be
forſaken in euery dome / as taynt falſe

by londes lawes in many contrees yf

is no ſynne ſo noyous to a royalme &
to euery comunyte as periury is / for yt
is cauſe yt ther may no ſynne be punyſſhed

¶Diues. Now I ſee that periurye is
a full greuous ſynne & full peryllous
to euery comunyte / & cauſe of moche
manſlaughter & ſhedyng of mannes
blood & leſynge of Royalmes. For as
I haue redde / y• Royalme of Englonde
for periurye & falſhode was tranſlated
from Brytons to Saxons. Afterwarde
it was tranſlated for periurye
from Saxons & Englyſſhe men
to the Danes. Afterwarde whan Englyſſhe
men had the kyngdome ayen
by the deth of the Danes / they kepte
it but two kynges tymes. Saynt Edwarde
& heraldes / & anone it was trāſlated
ayen for periurye vnto the Normans
by Wyllyam duke of Normandy
/ whiche ſlough well nyghe all the
chyualrye of this londe / & chaūged the
lordſhyp and the prelacye of this londe
nyghe all vnto the frenſſhe men.
And what murdre & ſhedynge of blode
fell for theſe periurers in theſe thre
tymes and chaūgynges full harde to
telle. And now allas newely in our
dayes we ben fallen in periury in the
hygheſt degree / not one but nygh all.
And what blood hath be ſhedde ſythen
bycauſe of our periurye / no tonge
can telle. And this londe by ſhedynge
of blood is ſo feblyſſhed in euery aſtate
that we be not of power without
ſpecyall myracle of god lenger for to

drede y• this royalme in ſhort tyme for

our periurye ſhall be tranſlated ayen
to the Brytones / or ellys to ſome other
tongues. I praye the ſaye forth
what thou wylt.

               PAuper. Furthermore I ſayd
that goddes name is taken

yf yu haue lykynge to here grete othes

Or yf thou wayte all vayne othes ne
art not myſprayſed whan thou hereſte
them / thou takeſt goddes name in

therto as thou oughteſt to doo. For
as Salomon ſayth / a mannes heere

ſadly in goddes name & auyſely / thou

of goddes holy name / but thou haue
the more euydence to the contrarye.
And but yu accepte his othe & gyue credence
therto but ye knowe the contrarye
ellys yu takeſt goddes name in vayne

thou forſokeſt hym for wytneſſe of

ofte falſe in his othes / though I byleue
hym not I do god no dyſhonour.
¶Pauper. That is ſoth / for thou
may well wote that god ſouerayne
treuth bereth hym no wytneſſe in his
faſholde. And therfore do worſhyp to
his othe & to goddes name / and repreue
his falſhode and deſpyte that he
doth to goddes holy name. Moreouer
yf thou here men ſwere or blaſpheme
goddes name / or name goddes name

them yf yu haue power ouer them / and

yf thou loue well thy god thou ſholdeſt
not here paciently ony ſpeche that

For yf thou louedeſt well ony man or

a preſaunt to hym of olde vytayles
& ſayd to hym. Your name ſpryngeth
ferre and wyde / that ther may
no kyng nor nacyon withſtande you.
Therfore we be come to you for ſaluacyon
of our lyues for to make peas
with you. Than Ioſue and the people
ſayd to theym. Yf ye dwelle in the
londe that god hath gyuen to vs / we
may no peas make with you. Than
Ioſue axed theym what they were &
from whens they cam. Syr ſayd they
we ben thy ſeuaūtes & come to the fro
full ferre contrees ſente fro the lordes
and the leders of our londe to make
peas with the. Thou may ſee by our
arraye that we be come fro ferre. For
whan we came out our clothes & our
ſhone were newe / now they ben al to
torne and al to rente. Our brede was
newe baken / and now it is hored.
Our botels and our wyne weren newe
/ and now our botels be nygh bruſten
and the wyne is ſoure / and our
vytales and the preſaunt that we haue
brought to the ben nyghe loſte for
elde. And thus they lyed almooſt euery
worde & deſceyued Ioſue / for they
dwelleden but .xx. lytyll myle thens.
Ioſue toke theyr preſaunt and made
peas with them. And he & all the
prynces of goddes people ſwore to
theym that they ſholde haue theyr lyues
and theyr goodes. Within a fewe
dayes after Ioſue cam to Gabaon / &
began to fyght ayenſt the cyte / anone
they cam out & ſhewed her charter
of peas. And how that Ioſue & the
prynces of goddes people alſo hadde
ſworen to theym to ſaue theyr lyues / the
people wolde haue ſlayne theym
bycauſe of theyr gyle. Than Ioſue
and the prynces ſayden to the people / We
may not ſlee them / for we haue
ſworen to theym in the name of our

lorde. And yf we forſwere vs / god ſhal
take vengeaunce of vs. ¶Diues. I
trowe that clerkes now a dayes wolde
ſaye that they were not bounde to
kepe that othe / ſythen they gate that
othe of theym with ſoo grete begyle.
¶Pauper. Yf they auyſed them wel
they wolde ſaye as Ioſue ſayd. For as
I fyrſt ſayd / a man ought to kepe his
othe yf it be lefull though he made it
for drede of deth. For euery othe leful
ought to be kepte though it be neuer
ſo moche ayenſt herte / and that ſheweth
god well afterwarde. For as we
fynde the ſeconde boke of the kynges
xxi. Thre hondred yere after. Saull
kyng of goddes people ſlewe all the
Gabaonytes y• he myght fynde to pleſe
his people / whiche hated alwaye y•
Gabaonites for theyr gyle God was
dyſpleaſed with y• dede / & lete y• kyng
Saull ſoone after ſlayne in batayll / &
all his houſholde & moche of goddes
people. After in tyme of Dauyd
that reygned next after Saull. Ther
felle ſuche an hongre in the londe of
Iſraell thre yere togydre y• moche of
goddes people peryſſhed. Dauyd axed
of god what the cauſe was of y• hongre.
God ſayd yt the deth of the Gabaonytes
whiche Saull had ſlayne y•
was cauſe therof. Dauyd ſente after
the Gabaonytes that were lefte and
ſayd to them. I knowe well yt for you
ſake this hongre & myſchyef is fallen
in my realme. Axe ye amendes what
ye wyll and I ſhall do it. Than they
ſayd / we axe neyther golde ne ſyluer / ne
no mannes deth of Iſraell / but
oonly vengeaunce on Saull and his
kynrede that ſoo wyckedly oppreſſed
vs and deſtroyed vs. We axe that euery
man of his kynred be ſlayne / and
that none be lefte of his kynrede. Dauyd
myght not graunte that axynge
for that othe that he hadde made to
Ionatas the ſone of Saull to ſaue
his kynrede. Than they axed ſeuen
men only of the kynrede of Saull to
hange them on y• gebettes ayenſt the
ſonne / & ſo to ſlee them dyſpyteouſly
in punyſſhynge of the ſpyte y• Saull
had do to goddes holy name / in y• he
dyde ayenſt the ſolempne couenaūtes
y• his predeceſſours had made & confermed
ſwerynge by goddes holy name
/ for in that Saull toke that othe &
goddes holy name in vayne. As ſayth
the mayſtre of the ſtoryes. Whan this
was done the hongre ceſſed / & anone
began rayne & plente of corne & fruyte.
¶Diues. This enſample is full
good & ſheweth well that euery othelefull
made ſholde be kepte. And that
euery man & woman ſholde flee to
do dyſhonour or ſpyte to goddes holy
name. Alſo it ſheweth well y• periury
& dyſpyſynge of goddes holy name / is
cauſe of ſhedynge of blood / of hongre
/ & of myſchyef / and that god wyl
not ſuffre that his holy name be dyſpyſed
ne taken in vayne. ¶Pauper.
Therfore god ſayth that euery man

               DIues. I thanke the
moche. For now knowe
I better than I dyde
byfore how the ſeconde
cōmaūdement
ſholde be kepte / and
what peryll it is to take goddes name
in vayne. Now I praye the enfourme
me in the thyrde cōmaundement.
¶Pauper. In the thyrde cōmaūdement
god byddeth that thou ſholdeſt
bethynke the & haue well in mynde
to halowe thyn holydaye. Sixe dayes
thou ſhalte werke & do all thyn owne
werkes. In the .vij. daye in the
ſabbot / that is to ſaye / reſte of thy lorde

no ſeruyle werke / neyther thou ne thy
ſone thy doughter ne thy ſeruaunte / man
ne woman / ne thy beeſt / ne the
ſtraūgers that ben within thy yates.
¶Diues. Why badde god that the
.vij. daye ſholde more be halowed
than the .vi. daye. ¶Pauper. For
as god ſayth there. In .vi. dayes
he made heuen and erthe and the ſee
and all thynge that is therin. And in
the .vij. daye he reſted and ceſſed of
his werkes / and therfore he bleſſyd
that daye and halowed it / and ordeyned
that in that daye man and beeſt
ſholde reſte / and that man that daye
in a ſpecyaall ſholde thanke god / for
all the creatures that he made byfore
in the .vi. dayes he made them to helpe
and ſeruyce and ſolace of man.
¶Diues Why ſayth holy wryte that
god reſted than the .vij. daye in ſoo
moche as that he neuer trauaylled.
For as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth / he made
all thynges without trauayll / and as
holy wryte ſheweth Geneſis pri.• He
ſayd but this one ſhorte worde. Fiat.
and badde that it ſholde be done / anone
it was done as he wolde haue it
¶Pauper. Whan holy wrytte ſayth
that god reſted the .vij. daye / he vnderſtandeth
therby that in the .vij.
daye he ceſſed for to make newe creatures
/ for euery thynge was made by
fore in the .vi. dayes / eyther in y• thynge

and in his ſymplytude / as man beeſt

in his cauſes / as thynge gendred
of corrupcōn / and thynges made by
crafte. For god in his godhede was
neuer in trauayll but alwaye in blyſfull
reſte without ende. And therfore
holy wrytte ſayth not that he reſted
after his werke ne in his werke / but
that he reſted from euery werke that
he had made / for he had no trauayll
for ony werke / & he was not holpen
by his werke / for he made no thynge
for nede but al for loue. ¶Diues. Yet

it ſemeth that god ceſſed not the

Two maner of werkes longen
to god / creacyon and gouernaunce.
From the werke of creacyon he ceſſed
the .vij. daye / and than prycypally
he began the werke of gouernaunce
and of kepynge / the whiche werke he
contynueth and ſhall contynue without
ende. And of this werke of gouernaunce
ſpeketh Cryſte the wordes in
the goſpell / but not of the wordes of
creacyon. ¶Diues. Ben ther ony mo
cauſes why god badde the .vij. daye
be halowed. ¶Pauper. Ther ben as
clerkes tallen .vi. cauſes. Fyrſte for
that god the .vij. daye reſted / that is
to ſaye / he ceſſed fro creacyon of newe
creatures. Alſo in tokenynge that
god in the .vij. daye delyuered y• childern
of Iſraell from the harde ſeruage
of Egypte & ledde them thrugh
the rede ſee drye fote in to the reſte of
the londe of byheſte. As we rede in holy
wryte Deut .v. Whiche delyueraū
                  ce
was a token that mankynde ſholde
thrughe Cryſtus paſſyon & by his
blood that he ſhedde vpon the rode be
delyuered out of the fendes ſeruage / and
come to the endeleſſe reſte of the
londe of lyfe. The .iij. cauſe is yt men
ſholde ye daye pryncypally gyue them
to holy medytacyon & to thanke god
of all his gyftes and his benefyces / and
to lerne goddes lawe & to prayſe
god. The .iiij. cauſe was for to be a
token that Cryſte the .vij. daye ſholde
reſte in his graue after that he had
trauayled .vi. dayes to refourme ayen
mankynde that was lorne thrughe
Adams ſynne. The .v. cauſe was to
be a token y• we muſt al ceſſe from vyces

be ſaued. As the ꝓphete ſayth. Quieſcite
agere peruerſe. diſcite bene agere.
Yſaye .i. Reſte ye to do amys & lerne
ye to do well. The .vi. cauſe is to be
a token of the endeleſſe reſte that we
ſhall haue from ſynne & payne in the
blyſſe of heuen for the good werkes yt
we doo in the .vi. dayes of our lyfe / that
is to ſaye al the dayes of our lyf
& the .vi. age of our lyfe / & for fulfyl
lynge the .vi. dedes of mercy whiche
Cryſte nameth in the goſpell. For as
we rede in the apocalyps .xiiij. The

is applyed ſayth that men after

                  Caplm .ij.
               DIues. Sythen that god badde
that the .vij. daye ſholde
be halowed / why kepe we the
viij. daye than / that is the ſondaye / and
not the .vij. daye. ¶Pauper.
God in the olde lawe gaaf thre maner
of cōmaūdementes. For ſome were
cerymonyall / ſome Iudycyall / & ſome
morall. The cerymonyalles were
but fygures & ſhadowes of thynges yt
were to come. And therfore whan tho
thynges were fulfylled that the cerymonyalles
betokened / the cerymonyales
ceſſed & vanyſſhed awaye / as the
ſhadowe vanyſſhed awaye by lyght

of the ſonne. Iudycyall cōmaūdementes
were in punyſſhynge of ſynne and
Iuſtyfyeng / of whiche ſome ceſſed / ſome
dwelle yet ſtylle. But morall cō
                  maūdementes
techeth vs to loue our
god & our euen cryſten / & to flee ſynne
& to loue vertues / tho laſte alwaye as
the .x. cōmaūdementes & ſuche other
And for aſmoche as this cōmaundement
is cerymonyal in parte as anentes
the tyme / & in parte it is moral / in
aſmoche as it techeth vs to worſhyp
our god & to reſte from vyces. Therfore
in as moche as it is morall it is
kept / but in y• y• it is cerymonynal it is
chaūged in to ſondaye as for the better
/ for that y• it fygured & betokened
is fulfylled. That was the reſte of
Cryſte in the ſepulcre in the .vij. daye
after the grete trauayll that he had
.vi. dayes byfore in reformacyon and
redempcyon of mankynde. Alſo we
be all boūden to worſhyp god now in
the newe lawe / but not in that maner
ne in that tyme yt they were boūden
in the olde lawe. ¶Diues. Why is it
more chaunged in the ſondaye than
in to an other daye. ¶Pauper. For
the grete benefyces and the grete worſhypfull
wondres that god ſhewed
that daye to mankynde. For on the
ſondaye the worlde began / and lyght
& angellys kynde was made. That
daye god ſente downe māna that is
angellys mete to the childern of Iſraell
in deſerte & fedde them alſo .xl.
yere. That daye god gaaf Moyſes
the lawe in the moūt Synay. That
daye Cryſte was borne of the mayden
Mary to ſaue mākynde. That daye
Cryſt roſe from deth to lyfe gyuyng
vs example & hope to ryſe from deth
to lyf. That daye the holy gooſt lyghted
in Cryſtus apoſtles and his dyſcyples.
That daye god ſhall come to
dome / as ſayth a grete clerke dockynge
/ ſuꝑ Deutro.• And alſo that daye
was the fyrſte daye & ſhalbe the laſte
daye that neuer ſhall haue ende. But
it ſhall be a daye of endeleſſe blyſſe to
theym that ſhall be ſaued. For right
as Cryſte roſe vp from deth to lyfe on
the ſondaye / & neuer deyed afterward
ne neuer ſhal deye. So ſhal we all in
the laſte ſondaye y• ſhalbe y• laſte day
ryſe vp from deth to lyf & neuer deye
after / but lyue in blyſſe without ende
yf we make here a good ende. This
daye is ſoo worſhypfull y• no byſſhop
may be ſacred but on the ſondaye / as
Raymūde ſayth li.i.ti. de ferijs. And
right as y• ſatyrdaye was halowed in
the olde lawe for the reſte y• god made
in the ſatyrdaye after y• creacōn & the
werkes that he made in the fyrſte vi.
dayes / ſo holy chirche thrugh techynge
of the holy ghooſt hath ordeyned
the ſondaye to be halowed for the reſte
that mankynde ſhal take after the
.vi. ages of this worlde on y• ſondaye
whiche reſte & ſabbot ſhall neuer haue
ende. Theyr ſabbot that was on
the ſatyrdaye tourneth alwaye ayen
to trauayll / but our ſabbot y• is in the
ſondaye atte laſte ſhal tourne in to endeleſſe

ferir y• is reſte in englyſſhe. For euery
daye we be boūde to ferie & to reſt frō

it is ſayd. Prima ſabbati. For it is fyrſte
not oonly in ordre of dayes / but it
is alſo fyrſte in dygnyte. For y• ſabbot
& the reſte in the ſolempnyte of the ſatyrdaye
of the olde lawe is now chaū
                  ged
in to y• ſondaye for ſynne of y• Iewes
whiche ſlewe Cryſte on good frydaye
/ & ſo put our lady ſaynt Mary &
all holy chirche in ſorowe & care & grete
trauayll both frydaye & ſatyrdaye
whyle Cryſte laye in his graue. But
for aſmoche as he roſe frō deth to lyf
on the ſondaye / & apperyd to his mod
& to his dyſcyples .vij. tymes y• daye
& ſoo on the ſondaye began the fyrſte
Ioye blyſſe & reſte of the newe lawe.
Therfore by goddes rightfull dome
the Iewes ſabbot on the ſatyrdaye torned
them to ſorowe & care and moche
trauayll / & our ſondaye torned vs in
to grete reſte and Ioye & blyſſe. And
as the ſatyrdaye was halowed by the
olde lawe / for god graūted that daye
fyrſte reſte to all mankynde after his
dampnacyon to perpetuell trauayll
for Adams ſynne. So is now the ſondaye
halowed / for than Cryſte graū
                  ted
fyrſte reſte Ioye & blyſſe to mankynde
in the newe lawe after his paſſyon
& ſaluacyon of mankynde & the
redempcōn / & torned the ſorowe that
holy chirche had on the ſatyrdaye by
malyce of the Iewes in to reſte & blyſſe
on y• ſondaye. And ſo it is fulfylled
that the prophete Ieremy ſayd .xxxi.
Redemit dn̄s populū ſuū. God hath
bought ayen his people with his precyous
blood / and hath delyuered his
people out of the fendes power. God
ſayth I ſhall tourne theyr mournynge
in to Ioye. I ſhall gladde theym of
theyr ſorowe and conforte them. And
by the prophete Ozee he ſayd that he
ſholde make the Ioye of ye Iewes ſabbottes
and of all theyr ſolempnytees
and of all theyr feſtes to ceſſe bycauſe
of theyr ſynne Ozee .ij.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .iij.
               ALſo for halowynge in the ſatyrdaye
was cerymonyal. For
as we fynde in dyuerſe places
of holy wryte / & namely Ezechielis
xx. Halowynge in the ſatyrdaye was
a ſpecyall token gyuen to the Iewes
wherby they ſholde be knowen from
other people / and ſo was circūciſyon / and
many other obſeruaūces & cerymonyes
that god gaue theym to be
knowen from other people. And therfore
right as the circūciſyon & other
obſeruaūces that were bytaken them
of god for a token of diſtynccōn from
other people ceſſed in Cryſtus paſſyon
ſo ceſſed halowynge in the ſatyrdaye
in Cryſtus paſſyon. For though it be
a morall cōmaundement to halowe
the .vij. daye / yet it is not morall ne
byndeth vs to halowe the .vij. daye in
the ſatyrdaye. And therfore we rede
Exodi .xxxiiij. et .xxxv. That whan
Moyſes had ben in the mount of Synay
with god .xl. dayes & .xl. nyghtes
without mete or drynke / and ſpoken
with god and there taken the lawe

we of hym in two tables of ſtone / &
two ſtemys and bemes of lyght ryſen
out of his face / as it had be two hornes
ſo ſhynynge & ſo bryght / that the
people was adrede of hym and durſt
not ſpeke with hym / and therfore he
put a veyll byfore his face whan he
ſholde ſpeke to ye people / & telle them
the lawes and the wyll of god. And
whan he had ſoo hydde his face with
the veyll. The fyrſte lawe that he gaue
them in goddes name was to halowe
the ſatyrdaye. And he ſpake no
worde than of the other .ix. cōmaūdemētes
/ but tolde forth other obſeruaū
                  ces
& cerymonyes whiche longed only
to the Iewes / & were but fygures &
ſhadowes of thynges to come whiche
ceſſed al in Cryſtus paſſyon. And ſoo
he ſhewed wel that halowyng in the
ſatyrdaye was cerymonyale / & ſholde
ceſſe with other cerymonyes in Cryſtus
paſſyon. And therfore whan y• he
badde them halowe the ſatyrdaye / he
put the veyll byfore his face in token
that halowynge on the ſatyrdaye &
other cerymonyes & lawes y• he gaue
them yt tyme was but a veyl helynge
ghooſtly vnderſtandynge vnder fygures
of thynges y• were to come. And
whan tho thynges were fulfylled by
the paſſyon of Cryſte / y• veyl & myſty
ſyght of fygures ſholde be done awaye
& ceſſe. And in token therof in
tyme of Cryſtus paſſyon / the veyl of
the Iewes Temple to rente & cleef in
two partes ye men myght ſee all the
preuy thynges y• were in the Temple
whiche were byfore hydde fro y• ſyght
of the people by y• veyl. Alſo the ſame
texte of the cōmaundement ſheweth
full well that halowynge in the
ſatyrdaye ſholde be tranſlated in to
the ſondaye / that is called the daye
of the ſonne. For though god ceſſed in
the ſatyrdaye from makynge of thynges
of newe kynde / yet in the ſatyrdaye
he made the ſatyrdaye as he made
eche daye byfore in the ſame daye.
But in the ſondaye next folowynge
he made no newe daye in kynde / for
that was the fyrſte daye / and ſoo he
reſted more in the ſondaye from werkynge
than he dyde reſte in the ſatyrdaye.
Alſo after grete trauayll ought
to be more reſte. But Cryſte goddes
ſone hadde more trauayl in recreacyon
and redempcyon of mankynde / than
he hadde to make al this worlde.
For in makynge of all the worlde
he hadde no trauayll / as ſayth ſaynt
Auſtyn / but oonly he badde it ſholde
be done / & it was done anone what
he wolde. But in creacōn & redempcyon
of mankynde he trauaylled ſoo / that
he ſwoted blood for anguyſſhe / &
deyed for trauayll & ſhedde his herte
blood / & ceſſed not of trauayll tylle in
the morowe tyde of y• ſondaye whan
he roſe from deth to lyue to comforte
all mankynde that wolde byleue in
hȳ. And he ſhewed openly than that
he was & is lorde of all thynge. And
ſayd to his apoſtles / that all the power
in heuen & in erthe was gyuen to
hym in his manhode. And therfore
the ſondaye is called the lordes daye.
Dies dn̄icus. And therfor ſythen god
wolde that the ſatyrdaye ſholde be halowed
in the olde lawe / for god ceſſe
                     •
                  
                  
than from creacyon / & ſo in that maner
began to reſte / moche more he wyl
that the ſondaye be halowed in the
newe lawe / for god ceſſed than from
the grete trauayll of our redempcyon
and of our ſaluacōn & creacyon.

that god made them to dwelle in tabernacles
& logges .xl. yere in deſerte
and there he ſaued them & kept them
& he badde that the fyrſte daye & the
viij. ſholde be full holy. By this feſte
of tabernacles yt came laſte after the
other feſtes of the Iewes ben vnderſtanden
the feſtes of the newe lawe / whiche
came laſte in the ende of the
worlde after the olde lawe. For al the
feſtes of the newe lawe ben feſtes of
tabernacles. For whan god came for
to be man / he made fyrſte his tabernacle
in the mayde Mary / whiche tabernacle
was arrayed & dyght with the
fayreſt braunches and bowes of grace
and vertues and of good thewys / as
it myght be founden in ony creature
/ for ſhe paſſed al creatures in grace
and goodneſſe. Of this tabernacle
ſpeketh the prophete .p̄o .xviij. In ſole
poſuit tabernaculū ſuū et ipſe tan

He made his tabernacle in the ſonne
that was our lady mayden and moder
bryghter than the ſonne. He came
out of her as an huſbonde out of his
chambre. An other tabernacle god
made hym in our manhode and in
our kynde / that was the blyſfull bodye
that whiche he toke of the mayden
Mary. For as the tabernacles were
made of the fayreſt braunches and
bowes that myght be founde / ſoo the
bodye of Cryſte was made & gadred
togydre of the cleneſt droppes of the
blood that was in our blyſſed ladye
ſaynt Marye clene mayden without
ſpotte of ſynne. In this tabernacle
god was born of y• mayden on Cryſtmaſſe
daye. In this tabernacle he
was circumcyded / worſhypped of the
thre kynges / & dwelled with vs in erthe
in our pylgrymage .xxxij. yere and
more. In this tabernacle he deyed for
mankynde / & roſe from deth to lyfe
on Eſter daye / & ſtyed vp in to heuen
on holy thurſdaye very god and very
man / & there he ſytteth on his faders
right honde aboue all heuens in this
tabernacle lorde & kyng of all thynge.
In this tabernacle he ſhall come
ayen at the dome / to deme the quycke
and the deed. And all the feſtes that
we holde of ony ſayntes / we halowe
them & holde them for the good dedes
that they dyde whyle they dwelled here
in the tabernacle of theyr bodye / in
hope to come to the endeleſſe tabernacle
full of Ioye & blyſſe without ende.

Of whiche tabernacle god ſpeketh in
the goſpell whan he byddeth the riche
men make poore men theyr frendes / that
they may reſceyue them in to the
endeleſſe tabernacle / of whiche ſpeketh
Dauyd. Quā dilecta tabernacula

how louely & how lykynge ben
thy tabernacles. My ſoule ſayth he
deſyreth & longeth to entre in to the

for ſorowe. And ſo y• ſolempnyte that
euer ſhall laſte / ſhall be a ſolempnyte
of tabernacles / whan we ſhall dwelle
in endeleſſe tabernacles with endleſſe
reſte Ioye & blyſſe. There the fyrſte
daye & the .viij. daye ſhall be full holy
/ whiche daye is the ſondaye. For yt
is the fyrſte daye & it is the .viij. daye
& ſhall be the laſte daye euer laſtynge
in Ioye and blyſſe. And therfor in the
feſtes of y• newe lawe that ben feſtes
of the tabernacles is y• ſondaye pryncypally
halowed as god badde than.
For it was the fyrſte daye and it is
the .viij. daye / and it ſhal be the laſte

               DIues. Why badde god that
we ſholde thynke to halowe
wel the holy dayes & the ſabbot.
¶Pauper. Ther is thre maner
of ſabbottes / that is to ſaye of reſte or
of halowynge. Scilicet pectoris. temporis.
et eternitas. That is to ſaye of
reſte of herte / of tyme / & of endleſſe reſtynge.
By reſte of herte & of thought
men come to reſte of tyme. And by reſte
of thought & of tyme / men come
to endeleſſe reſte. So without reſte of
herte and of thought / noo man may
come to the endeleſſe reſte that the
ſabbot and the holy daye betokeneth
And therfore god bad vs that we ſholde
pryncypally trauayll to haue ſabbot
& reſte of herte & of thought / without
whiche reſte & ſabbot we may not
well halowe ony holy daye. And therfore
Cryſte ſayd in the goſpell / that
out of the herte whan it is out of reſt
come euyll thoughtis / manſlaughters
auoutrers / lecherers / theftes / falſe wytneſſes
/ & dyſpyte of god Mathei .xv.
whiche ſynnes deſtroye charyte and
peas / and ben cauſes of moche vnreſt
in this worlde / and lette reſte of tyme
ſo that vnnethes they may be ony tyme
in reſte. And therfore god ſayth / thynke
that yu halowe well thyn holy
daye. Bethynke the yf thou be in charyte
& reſte of herte with god & man
And yf yu be ſtyred ayenſt thyn euen
cryſten by wrath hate or enuye / or haue
ony heuy herte ayenſt thy brother / go
as god byddeth in the goſpell & be
fyrſte recoūſeylled to thy brother / and
than come & make thyn offrynge of
holy prayer of thankynge of prayſynge
/ and of thy gyftes to god. And but
thou do ſoo & put awaye all rancour
and heuyneſſe of herte / ellys thyn halowynge
& thy ſabbot is not pleaſaūt
to god. Alſo bethynke the yf yu be in
dedely ſynne / and repente the and be
ſhreuen as ſoone as yu myght in good
maner / & ſo offre vp thy ſelfe to god
by charyte & by ſorowe of herte & make

thy ſelfe holy / and than art thou
able to halowe well the holy daye.
For as longe as yu art in dedely ſynne
by wyll or by dede / ſo longe thou haloweſt
not thyn holy daye. For thou
doſt ſeruyle werke of ſynne / and doſt
dyſpyte to the holy daye / whiche is or
deyned that men ſholde than amende
them and ſerue god more ſpecyally
than in the werken daye. And as
longe as man or woman is in dedely
ſynne / they ſerue the deuyll and not
to pleaſaūce of god. Alſo god byddeth
that men ſholde bethynke theym to
halowe well the holy daye. For in the
holy daye namely on y• ſondaye men
ſholde drawe theyr wyttes to gydre
from the worlde & bethynke them yf
they had ought treſpaſſed that woke
by recheleſhede or by couetyſe / or by lechery
/ or by ony other wyſe / and aſke
god forgyueneſſe. Alſo thynke on the
good ſpede and benefyces that god
hath ſente theym that woke / or euer
byfore & thanke hym therof. Thanke
hym of his endeleſſe mercy / and of
his endeleſſe charyte that he ſhewed
to mankynde. Thynke how he made
man to his owne lykeneſſe to be
heyre & cytezeyn of heuen. Thynke
how he made all thynge for man.
Thynke what blyſſe he hath ordeyned
to man and woman yf they doo
well / & what payne yf they do euyll.

               THerfore ſayth Orygenes ſuꝓ

Than ſayth he come to chirche / and

pryncypally to thynges that ben to come
& that yet ben Inuyſyble. He that
thus doth ſayth he haloweth wel his
holy daye / and he maketh the ſacrefyce
of his ſabbot. And therfore the lawe
ſayth thus / we haue ordeyned that
all ſondayes be kepte with all maner

that men abſteyne theym from all

lawe ſayth that men ſholde no thynge
do on the ſondaye / but gyue theym
to god / ne do no ſeruyle werke. But
that daye ſholde be occupyed in pray
ſynge & worſhyppynge of god and in
ghoſtly ſonges. De con di .iij. Ieiunia
Men ſholde on y• holy daye ſerue god
with herte mouth and werke. With
herte thynke as I haue ſayd. With
mouth well ſpekynge in prayer prayſynge
and worſhypynge of god / and
good informacyon of theyr euen cryſten.
In werke alſo of dedes of almeſſe

that ben the fendes ſee how mannes
ſoule and womannes was defouled
with ſynne on the holy dayes / and
ſcorned his holy dayes and his ſabbottes.
For the holy daye was ordeyned
in confuſyon of y• fende & in worſhyp
of god & for ſaluacōn of mānes
ſoule. But now it is torned to ſhame
of mānes ſoule / & to deſpyte & offence
of god / & in pleaſaunce of the fende.
For in the ſondaye reygneth more lechery
/ glotony / manſlaughter / robbery
/ bacbytynge / periury
/ & other ſynnes
/ more than reygned all the weke
byfore. And whan men come to chirche
/ they leue byddynge of bedes and
ſpende theyr tyme in ſynfull Iangelynge
/ for there they caſte gyle ayenſt
theyr euen cryſten / there they holde
theyr peruys of many wronges whiche
they thynke to doo. And therfore
god may ſaye to them as he ſayd to y•
Iewes. It is wryten ſayd he that myn
hous ſhalbe called an hous of prayer
& ye haue made it a denne of theues
in yt yt ye contryue your gyle & falſhode
to robbe your euen cryſten of his
good / his right / & his fame. And therfore
he ſayth by the prophete Yſaye .i.
My ſoule hateth your ſolempnytees
& holy dayes / they ben ful heuy to me
I haue trauayll to ſuffre them. But
therfore ſayth he / whan ye ſhal lyfte
vp your hondes to me. I ſhall tourne
myn eyen awaye from you. And alſo
whan ye multeplye your prayers to

be ful of blood that ye haue ſhedde

               ALſo my frende god badde yt
men ſholde thynke to halowe
well the holy daye. For man
& womā ſholde ſo bethynke them byfore
in the werke daye & ordeyn theyr
occupacōns alſo / y• they ſholde not nede
to breke y• holy dayes. For yf a mā
                  nedeth
to breke the holy daye / & y• nede
come of his owne folye and of his
myſgouernaūce byfore / he is not excuſed.
by that nede. Moche leſſe than is
he excuſed yf that nede come of purpoſe
& of couetyſe. And therfore they
that wyll not go ne ſende to market
in the werke daye to bye theyr neceſſaryes
/ but abyde tyll on the ſondaye
for ſparynge of tyme / they be not excuſed
though tho thynges ben nedeful
to them. Men ſholde ſtudye & dyſpoſe
them as beſely to ſerue god on the
ſondaye / as they ſtudye byfore to trauayl
for themſelfe on the werke daye
For god hath graunted .vi. dayes to
man and woman for to trauayll for
themſelfe / & the .vij. daye he hath reſerued
& kepte to his ſeruyce. We rede
in holy wryte Numeri .xv. That
a man wente in the ſabbot daye and
gadred ſtyckes. He was taken & ledde
to Moyſes / & he putte hym in pryſon
tyll he had an anſwere of god what
he ſholde doo with hym. God badde

Moyſes that he ſholde be ledde out of
goddes caſtels yt were called the dwellynges
& tentys of goddes folke / and
there the people ſholde ſtone hym to
deth. And ſo he was ſlayne pytefully
for he bythought hym not byfore for
to halowe the holydaye / for he myght
haue gadred ſtyckes in the daye byfore.
And ſythen he was ſoo ſpytefully
ſlayne for gadrynge of ſtyckes to make
therwith his fyre yt was nedeful to
hym. Moche more ſholde they be punyſſhed
y• on the ſondaye gadre togydre
brondes of ſynnes / of couetyſe / of
lechery / periury / & bacbytytnge for to
brenne with theyr ſoules in helle with
out ende but they amende them ¶Diues.
What calleth god ſeruyle werkes
¶Pauper. Euery dedely ſynne is ſeruyle
werke. For as Cryſte ſayth in the
goſpell. Who ſo doth ſynne he is ſeruaūte
of ſynne & thrall to the fende.
Qui facit peccatū ſeruus eſt peccati.
And ſuche ſeruyle werke god forbedeth
euery daye / but mooſt on the holy
daye. For who ſo doth dedely ſynne
on the holy daye he doth double ſynne
/ for he doth y• ſynne & therto he breketh
the holy daye ayenſt goddes cō
                  maūdement.
Alſo ſeruyle werke is called
euery bodely werke done pryncypally
for temporall lucre & worldely
wynnynge / as byenge & ſellynge / erynge
/ ſowynge / mowynge / repynge
/ and all craftes of worldely wynnynge.
Alſo pledynge / motynge / markettes / fayres / ſyttynge
of Iuſtyces & of Iuges
/ ſhedynge of blood and execucyon
of punyſſhynge by the lawe / & all the
werkes that ſholde lette a man from
goddes ſeruyce / and dyſpoſe hym to
couetyſe or to the fendes ſeruyce. Neuertheles
yf erynge & ſowynge / repynge
/ mowynge
/ cartynge & ſuche other
nedeful werkes be done purely for almeſſe
/ & oonly for heuenly mede / and
for nede of them that they ben to / in
lyght holy dayes than they ben noo
ſeruyle werkes / ne the holy daye therby
is not broken. Neuertheleſſe in the
ſondayes and grete feſtes ſuche werkes
ſholde not be done but for grete
nede compelle men therto.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .viij.
               DIues. why badde god yt both
man & beeſt ſholde reſte & halowe
the holy daye. ¶Pauper.
For as Salomon ſayth Sap̄ .vi.
et .xi. God loueth all thynge that he
made / & hath cure of al thynges that
he made. And therfor he ordeyned reſte
in the holy dayes / not only for his
owne worſhypp & for ghooſtly helpe
of ſoule / but alſo for bodely helpe bothe
of man & beeſt. But the couetyſe
of man were refreyned by reſte on the
holy daye he ſholde neuer reſte. But
with trauayll ſlee hym ſelfe / his ſeruaūtes
/ his ſubgettes / add his beſtes.
And therfore both to ſaue man and
beeſt & for grete prouffyt of man / god
badde reſte on the holy daye. For both
man & beeſt nedeth reſte after traueyl
and ſhall be the more freſſher all the
weke after to trauayll yf they haue
reſte on the holy daye. And therfore it
falleth ofte that they whiche wyll not
reſte on the ſondaye / ben made to reſte
al y• weke after / eyther of ſekeneſſe

that they falle in by ouer trauayll / or
by ſekenes / or by feblenes of theyr ſeruauntes
/ and of theyr beſtes / or ellys
by deth. For oftentyme they ſlee theyr
beſtes by ouer moche trauayll / & contynuynge
of trauayll. And therfore
in the begynnynge of the worlde as
whan Adam ſynned in the .vi. daye
by etynge of an apple ayenſt goddes
cōmaundement / and that god hadde
dampned hym and all his to perpetuell
trauayl for his ſynne. After this
of his grete and endeleſſe mercy / he
tempred and ſlaked his harde dome / and
ordeyned reſte both to man and
beeſt in the .vij. daye. And therfore
ſayth holy wryte Gen̄ .ij. That god
fulfylled his werkes in the .vij. daye
not oonly / for he made than the .vij.
daye & ceſſed of creacōn / but alſo pryncypally
for he ſhewed than fyrſte mercy
ayenſt ſynne grauntynge and byddynge
reſte in the .vij. daye both to
man & to beeſt whiche he dampned in
the daye byfore to perpetuell trauayll
for Adams ſynne / whiche mercy was
fulfyllynge & parfeccōn of al his werkes
Quia miſeracōes eius ſuꝑ omnia
oꝑa eius. For as Dauyd ſayth goddes
mercy is aboue all his werkes.
And ſaynt Iames ſayth. Mercy enhaūſeth
rightfull dome. And but god
had ended his werkes in mercy in the
vij. daye / & ſlaked his harde dome ayenſt
mankynde for Adams ſynne / ellys
his werkes had not ben complete
ne parfyght / in aſmoche as y• pryncypal
creature for whom he made all
thynge was loſte. For whan the fynale
cauſe of ony werke fayleth / that
werke is not complete ne parfyght.
For this mercy yt god ſhewed to man
whan he ordeyned reſt in the .vij. daye
that was called ſabbot / fygure of endeleſſe
reſte of mankynde. Cryſt ſayth
in the goſpell. That the ſabbot was
made for man / not man for the ſabbot
Marci .ij. But ſynfull man be ſo
blent with couetyſe / yt he tourneth his
dampnacōn & his payne in to lykynge
/ and hath leuer to trauayll to his
vndoynge & vnto his dampnacyon / than
to reſt to his ſaluacōn. And hath
leuer to folowe the harde ſentence of
god to his punyſſhynge / than to take
his grace and his mercy to be eaſed / Suche
ben lyke oules & backes / whiche
hate the daye & loue the nyght / lyke
to the fendes of helle yt neuer haue
recte / ne for malyce wyll ſeke reſte.

               QOre ouer my frende we fynde
four maner of ſabbottes in
holy wrytte. One ſabbot of
dayes that was the .vij. daye ordeyned
of god for reſte & eaſe both of man &
of beeſt. Alſo we fynde a ſabbot of
monethes ordeyned alſo of god for to
reſte both of man and beeſt that was
the .vij. moneth that man and beeſt
ſholde reſte theym than after the grete
trauaylle that they hadde done in
the two monethes byfore / in whiche
was theyr herueſt to gadre corne / wyne
/ and oyle / and other fruyte. The
vij. moneth was Septembre / as for
than in that hote contree herueſt was
all done. Alſo we fynde a ſabbot of
yeres / that was the .vij. yere. For

that yere the londe reſted y• it myght
bere the better & the more plenteuouſly
after / for that yere was noo londe
ſowen. Alſo we fynde a ſabbot of ſabbottes
/ that was the fyfth yere ordeyned
of god for reſte of the londe / of
beeſt / of man / & namely of them that
were in trauayll of trybulacyon. For
than outlawed men myght come ayen
home in ſurete. Than bounde
men were made free / & dettes forgyuen.
Than men reſceyued ayen theyr
herytage. By the ſabbot of dayes is
vnderſtonden reſte from vyces in the
lyfe actyf / that hath .vi. dayes to werke
in. By the ſabbot of mone is vnderſtonden
reſte that men haue in the
lyfe contemplatyf / both from vyces &
temptacōns / for that moneth was moche
holy / but not all holy. Right ſoo
they that haue the lyfe contemplatyf
they haue more reſte from vyces and
temptacōns / than they that haue the
lyfe actyfe / but ful reſte haue they not
in this worlde. By the ſabbot of yeres
whan the londe reſted the .vij. yere / is
vnderſtonden the reſte that our ſoules
ſhall haue in the blyſſe of heuen whyles
the erthe of our bodyes ſhall reſte
in the graue. By the ſabbot of ſabbottes
that was the .l. yere is vnderſtonden
the reſte without ende / that
we ſhall haue in heuen whan we ſhal
go ayen both bodye & ſoule vnto our
herytage yt we loſte thrughe Adams
ſynne / whan all our trauayll & trybulaco

               DIues. Sythen the ſabbot of
dayes was moſte ſolempne in
the olde lawe / for it was not
lefull that daye to go ouer a thouſande
pass / ne to dyght theyr mete / & more
ouer yt daye were offred two lambes
paſſynge the comon ſacrefyce that
was done euery daye / ſythen than the
ſolempnyte of the ſabbottes is tranſlated
in the newe lawe in to the ſondaye
/ why is not the ſondaye as worſhypfull
in the newe lawe / as was
the ſabbot in the olde lawe. For as
that was called the ſabbot of our lorde
/ alſo the ſondaye is called the daye
of our lorde paſſynge all other dayes
And yet we haue in the yere many
dayes more ſolempne than is the ſondaye.
¶Pauper. All the feſtes of the
newe lawe that ben the dayes and
the ſabbottes of our lorde. For alle
tho ben of hym ſelfe in hym ſelfe / or
ellys of hym ſelfe in his ſayntes. In
the olde lawe was no feſte of our lorde
but only the ſabbot / whiche was halowed
in mynde of the creacōn of the
worlde / & in mynde yt god the .vij. day
ceſſed of creacyon. And alſo than to
thanke hym for his endeleſſe goodneſſe
that he ſhewed to mankynde in
his creacyon whan he made all bodely
& vyſyble creatures to ſerue man / &
man to ſerue hym here in grace &
after in the blyſſe of heuen without ende
Other feſtes of the olde lawe were
but ſolēpnytees & myndes of auentures
& proſperytes y• felle to the Iewes
in tyme of the olde lawe. And therfor
the ſabbot amonges them was mooſt
ſolempne. And amonges vs alſo the

ſondaye is mooſt ſolempne and holy
for the grete dedes and wondres that
god dyde in the ſondaye. But for as
moche as it cometh ofte we make it
not alwaye lyke ſolempne / for it falleth
the ſondaye in whiche god ſhewed
his wondres / as Eſterdaye Wytſondaye
to be more ſolempne than
other comon ſondayes. Other feſtes
alſo as Cryſtmaſſe daye & Epyphanye
daye / in as moche as they ben our
lordes dayes & come but ones in the
yere / therfore we make more ſolempnyte
in tho dayes / than we doo comonly
on the ſondaye. And ſo we do
in many other feſtes / for all they be
feſtes and dayes of our lorde. Neuertheleſſe
ther is no daye ſo ſolempne in
themſelfe as the ſondaye / for that is
alwaye ſolempne for y• wondres that
god dyde therin. Other dayes ſomtyme
ben ſolempne / and ſomtyme not
ſolempne after that the feſtes therin

tyme as holy as the ſondaye / for
Cryſte ſtyed vp that daye to the heuen.
And than began the proceſſyon

Cryſte wente in proceſſyon with his

moche deſpyte on the ſabbot / therfore

he was dyſpleaſed & ſayd by the prophetes
Yſaye .i. and Ozee .ij. That

               DIues. Why wolde god make
the worlde more in the nombre
of .vi. dayes than in ony other
nombre of dayes. ¶Pauper. For as
Salomon ſayth. God made al thynge
in nombre in weyght and in meſure.
He made noo thynge to moche
ne to lytyll. But he made euery thynge
parfyghtly in his kynde / and ended
all his werkes in parfyghtneſſe.
And for the nombre of .vi. is the fyrſte
nombre euen y• is parfyght / therfore
he made all the worlde in nombre of
.vi. dayes. ¶Diues. How is y• nombre
of .vi. dayes more parfyght than another
nombre. ¶Pauper. For all his
partes y• mete him yf they be taken to
gydre make euen .vi. as .i.ij.iij. make
euen .vi. & theſe .iij. mete hym. For .vi.
tymes one is .vi. & thryes two is .vi. &
twyes thre is .vi. And this parfeccōn
is in no nombre within .x. but in .vi.
And fro .x. to an hondred is none but
xxviij. And fro an hondred to a thouſande
is but this euen nombre four
hondred four ſcore & .xvi. The next
is .viij. thouſande one hondred and
xviij. & thā no mo ſuche but one with
in an hondred thouſande. And who
ſoo wyll fynde that he muſte ſtudye.
After an hondred thouſande ben mo
ſuche than all the clerkes vnder the
ſonne can telle / and mo than ony herte
may thynke or tongue can telle / &
yet is it full harde to fynde one. And
for that .vi. is the fyrſte parfyght nombre
in this maner. Therfore god wolde
make this worlde in the nombre
of .vi. in a token that all his werkes
were parfyght. And therfore ſayth holy
wryte Gen̄ .ij. That heuen and
erthe & al theyr arraye were parfyght

And for the ſame cauſe god made
man the .vi. daye as for a parfyght
and a noble creature. For the ſame
cauſe in the .vi. age of the worlde he
bycame man. And on the .
                     •
                  i. daye a
good frydaye the .vi. hour of ye daye
in the .vi. age he bought mankynde
ayen with his precyous blood in token
y• all his werkes were parfyght. And
the ſame nombre of dayes god hath
graūted vs for to werke in / in token y•
all our werkes ſholde be parfyght &
good / & no thynge do amys / that we
ſholde for noo couetyſe do to moche / ne
for no ſlouth do to lytyll / but holde
vs alwaye in a meane & in euenhe
de / for god graūted vs no tyme to ſynne
Therfore wyll he that we alwaye
be euen with god and with our euen
cryſten / as ſixe is alwaye euen with
his partes to gydre.

               DIues. Why bad god reſte on
the .vij. daye more than an
other daye. ¶Pauper In token
that as .vij. cometh next after y•
parfyght nombre of .vi. dayes of werkynge
/ ſoo after parfyght werkes in
this worlde ſhall folowe parfyght reſte
in the other worlde. Alſo he badde
reſte in the .vij. daye for y• paſſeth the
parfyght nombre / in token y• he wyll
that no thynge be done paſſynge parfeccōn.
And therfore all ſynne is comprehended
in .vij. dedely ſynnes. For
as .vij. paſſeth y• parfyght nombre of
.vi. ſo euery ſynne paſſeth parfeccōn
& is out of parfeccōn of all good werkes.
Alſo god badde reſte the .vij. daye
for he wyll that men reſte them than
both gooſtly & bodely. Gooſtly from
beſyneſſe & thought of the worlde. Bodely
from bodely trauayll. For why
vij. is made of four & thre. Four betokeneth
bodely thynges made of four
elementes. Thre betokeneth mannes
ſoule made to the lykeneſſe of the holy
trynyte. And therfor he badde reſte in
the .vij. daye yt men ſholde than reſt
both bodye & ſoule. Alſo god bad reſt
in the .vij. daye in token y• after parfyght
werkes ſhal folowe endeles reſt
both of bodye & of ſoule. For this nō
                  bre.
vij. in aſmoche as all tyme & all
duracōn is cōprehended in .vij. dayes
therfore it betokeneth endeles laſtynge.
And therfore reſte on the .vij. daye
betokeneth endeles reſt. Alſo my frende
god ordeyned reſte in the .vij. daye
in token of .vij. blyſſes whiche we ſhal
haue for parfyght werkes yt we do here
in .vi. dayes and .vi. ages of this
worlde. For anentes y• bodye we ſhall
haue four blyſſes / bryghtneſſe & beaute
without ony ſpotte. For as Cryſte
ſayth in the goſpell. Men & wymen
ſhall ſhyne in heuen as bryght as the
ſonne. Alſo men ſhall haue there inpaſſybylyte
& helth of bodye without
all maner ſekeneſſe / no thynge ſhall
dere them ne dyſeaſe them. Alſo they
ſhal haue delyuerhede of body & lightne
s;ſe
without lettynge / for they ſholde
be as lyght as thought & in twynkelynge
of an eye be where as they wyll
Alſo they ſhall haue ſotylte of bodye
without ony withſtandynge / for ther
ſhal no thynge withſtande them. But
as the ſonne paſſeth y• glaſſe without

lettynge of the ſonne / ſo ſhal they paſſe
ouer walle & euery thynge at theyr
wyll without ony dyſeaſe or ony lettynge.
And anentes the ſoule we ſhal
haue the blyſfull ſyght of goddes face
/ brennynge loue to god and to our
euen cryſten / & alwaye haue hym that
we loue and what we deſyre. There
all our loue ſhall be in Ioye without
woo drede and ſorowe. In this worlde
euery loue is medled with woo / in
token of theſe ſeuen blyſſes that we
ſhal haue in endeleſſe reſte for our parfyght
werkes. Therfore god badde
vs reſte in the .vij. daye.

Moyſes the lawe in the mount of
Synay. He toke hym the .x. cōmaūdementes
wryten in two tables of ſtone
In the fyrſte table were wryten the
thre fyrſte cōmaūdementes whiche techen
vs how we ſholde worſhypp our
god & loue hym aboue all thyng. And
therfore they ben called the cōmaūdementes
of the fyrſt table / both for worthyne

table were wryten other .vij. cōmaū
                  dementes
/ that techen vs to loue our

And ſo all the .x. cōmaūdementes ben
cōprehended & cloſed in y• two cōmaū
                  dement
of charyte. The fyrſt cōmaū
                  dement
of charyte is this / ye yu ſhalt loue
thy lorde god with all thyn herte / with
al thy ſoule / with al thy mynde
with al thy myght. Whan he ſayth yu
ſhalt loue thy god with all thyn herte
excludeth all maner of ydolatrye / yt is
forboden by the fyrſte cōmaūdement
that no man ſette his herte / ne his faythe
/ ne his truſte in no creature more
than in god / ne ayenſt goddes worſhyp.
For who ſo loueth well an other
he hath kyndely a truſte & a fayth in
hym. And after that he loueth / ſo he
truſteth. And there he truſteth mooſt / comonly
he loueth mooſt. And therfore
god badde that yu ſholdeſt loue hym
with all thyn herte / yt is to ſaye with
all thy fayth / ſoo that yu ſette all thy
fayth & thy truſte in hym byfore all
other / as in hym that is almyghty &
may beſt helpe at nede. And therfore
the fyrſte cōmaūdement of theſe thre
is applyed pryncypally to the fader
almyghty. Alſo god byddeth that yu loue
hym with all thy ſoule / that is to
ſaye / as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth with all
thy wyll / without contradiccōn / that
thy wyll be not contrarye to his wyll
but alwaye confourmed to his wyll.
And in yt he byddeth yt yu take not his
name in vayne. But as yu haſte taken
the name of Cryſte / & art called cryſten
/ ſo confourme thy wyll / thy lyfe / &
thy ſpeche to y• wyll of Cryſte / that
yu wyll no thynge / ne do no thynge / ne
ſaye no thynge ayenſt his wyll by thy

ſykerly that yf thou fulfylle goddes
wyll here in erthe / he ſhall fulfyll
thy wyl in heuen. And loke that thou
ſpende all thy lyfe and thy beynge to
his worſhyppe and in his loue. And
than loueſt thou hȳ with all thy ſoule
/ in whiche pryncypally is thy lyfe
and thy beynge. And therfore yf thou
ſpende not thy lyf and thy beynge in
his loue / thou loueſt hym not with all
thy ſoule / and therto thou takeſt his
name in vayne / for his name is. Qui
eſt. That is to ſaye. He that is. For
all thynge that is taketh his beynge
of hym. And therfore yf y• ſpende thy
lyfe & thy beynge in ſynne & vanyte / yu
takeſt his name of beynge in vayne.
Alſo loke that thou ſpende all thy
wytte in his loue / that yu ſtudye to knowe
the treuth / that is Cryſtus name.
For he ſayth. Ego ſum verytas. And
ſo ſtudy to flee falſhode & folye by helpe
of Cryſte goddes ſone yt is al wytty
And therfore the ſeconde cōmaundement
is applyed to y• ſeconde perſone
in trynyte / yt is the ſone all wytty. Alſo
he byddeth yt yu loue hym with alle
thy mynde without forgetynge of his
benefyces and his gyftes to the & to

the to kepe well the holy daye whiche
is ordeyned pryncypaly that men ſholde

thynke than on god and on heuenly
thynges. Than thynke on theyr owne
vnkyndneſſe and of goddes goodneſſe
as I ſayd fyrſte. And therfore
he ſayth. Memento. Thynke that
thou halowe well the holy dayes.
that is to ſaye / loue god with all thy
thought and with al thy mynde / that
thou be in wyll no thynge to thynke
ayenſt his pleſaunce / and that thou
haue lykynge to thynke of hym by
grace of the holy ghooſt / to whome
the thyrde commaundement is applyed
/ without whome as ſaynt Poule
ſayth. We may thynke noo good
thought. The fyrſte cōmaundement
is applyed to the fader almyghty that
may beſt helpe at nede. For mawmettes
& ydolatrye may not helpe. The
ſeconde cōmaundement is applyed to
the ſone alwytty / whoſe name is treuthe
& ſouerayne wyſdome. For he knoweth
all / he may not be dyſceyued / &
treuth ſholde not be taken in vayne / but
alwaye worſhyped & wyſely mayntened
The thyrde cōmaundement is
applyed to the holy ghooſt / whiche is

                  litus / that is to ſaye comforter
For the holy daye is ordeyned
for to comforte both the ſoule and the

And the holy ghooſt comforteth

of euery bale. He gyueth reſte after

abateth carefull thoughtes / & gyueth

techeth vs to loue hym wyſely.
The thyrde recheth vs to loue hȳ ſwetely
in eaſe & reſte of herte. By the fyrſte
cōmaūdemēt god techeth vs fayth

delyuer hym / & I ſhall defende hym
for he hath knowen my name. Beatus

man whoſe hope is in the name of

ſayth. Ther is no name in whiche

name Iheſus. And therfore they
that haue goddes name in worſhyppe
may haue ſyker hope to be ſaued. And
tho yt haue it in deſpyte ought to be in
grete drede. By the thyrde cōmaūdement
god techeth vs charyte. For charyte
and good loue is reſte in euery
wo & trauayll / for loue maketh trauayll
lyght & eaſy / that ſholde elly

t
of charyte we be boūde to ſhewe

loue to god in herte / in worde / in werke
And therfore god byddeth that we
ſholde loue hym with all our herte / with
all our ſoule & mynde / that is to
ſaye / with all our ſpeche. For ſpeche
outwarde is a token of thoughtes inwarde.
Alſo he byddeth vs loue hym
with all our myghtes / that it to ſaye
with all our werkes. And ſo the fyrſt
cōmaundement of the fyrſte table techeth
vs to loue god with all our hert
The ſeconde techeth vs to loue hym
with al our worde / & ſhewe hȳ loue in

he wyl ſpeke good & worſhyp of hym
that he loueth & be gladde to here of
his good name & ſpeke of hym good
& worſhyp / and ſory to here his name
deſpyſed & dyffamed. By the thyrde
cōmaūdement we ben taught to ſhewe
loue to god in dede / that is to leue
our owne occupacōns on ye holy dayes
& gyue vs pryncypally to ſerue god &
to be occupyed with hȳ & do nothyng
but for his loue & to his worſhyp / or
for grete nede of our ſelfe. For who ſo
loueth an other wel / he wyl ſeke a tyme
to ſpeke with hym & to dele with

with his precyous blood / & ſaueth

we loue hym in this maner with all
our myghtes & dedes & werkes / & halowe
thus the holy daye & the ſabbot
that he hat boden vs halowe. He ſholde

                  maūdemēt
of charyte which byddeth
vs loue our euen cryſten as our ſelfe.
¶Pauper. Mankynde hath two begynnynges.
The fyrſte begynnynge
and begynner is god. And the ſeconde
begynnynge and begynner is the

fader and the moder. By the fyrſte cō
                  mau
dement
of the fyrſte table we be
caught to worſhyp god aboue al thynges
/ as hym that is begynnynge of vs
and of all creatures. By the fyrſte cō
                  maundement
of the ſeconde table we
be taught to worſhyp fader and moder
that ben our begynnynge next after
god. And therfore he ſayth in the
fyrſte cōmaundement of the ſeconde
table. Honora patrem tuum et matrem
tuam. That is to ſaye / worſhyp
thy fader and thy moder. By
the cōmaūdementes of the fyrſt table
he taught vs to loue god aboue all
thynge. By the cōmaundementes of
the ſeconde table he techeth vs to loue
our euen cryſten as our ſelfe. And
for as moche as charyte is mooſt ſhewed
by worſhyppynge & helpynge of
our euen cryſten. Therfore he begynneth
by techynge of worſhyp y• ought
to be done to theym that we owe by
waye of charyte mooſt to worſhyp after
god & mooſt to helpe that is fader
and moder. And therfore he ſayth. Honora
patrem tuum et matrem tuam.
Worſhyp thou thy fader and thy moder.
By whiche cōmaundement we
ben bounden to helpe our bodely fader
& moder at nede and be to theym
buxom and meke / and flee theyr dyſpleaſaūce
/ not deſpyſe them / not angre
them vnreſonably / not banne ne
warye them / ne harme them / ne ſcorne
them for none age / for none vnclene

they ſaye or do / but ſupporte them in
theyr age & febleneſſe / as they ſupported
vs in our youthe / & holpe vs / and
kepte vs in our febleneſſe / whan we
coude not ne myght not helpe our ſelfe
We fynde Geneſis .ix. That Noe
hadde thre ſones. Sem. Cham. and
Iaphet. Whan the flood was done
it happed that theyr fader Noe dranke
wyne ſoo that he was dronke / for
he knewe not the myght of the wyne
For byfore the flood men dranke noo
wyne ne ete noo fleſſhe. And whan
Noe was thus dronke / his myddell
ſone Cham foūde hym lyggynge bare
/ ſo yt he myght ſee his preuy membres
/ and anone he laughed his fader
to ſcorne & wolde not couer his fader
but wente & tolde it to his brethern in
Iapynge & ſcornynge his fader. But
his brethern wolde not ſee that nyce
ſyght / but tourned theyr face frō theyr
fader & caſte a clothe vpon hym & couered
hyw honeſtly. Whan Noe awoke
and wyſte what his myddell ſone
Cham had done to hym / he was wrothe
wt hȳ & curſed Chanaan Chams
ſone & all that ſholde come of hym &
made hȳ thrall & boūde to Sem and
Iaphet / & to theyr childern after them
And thus for ſcornyng & vn worſhyp
that the ſone dyde to the fader began
fyrſte boundage and thraldome and
was confermed of god. ¶Diues. Sythen
Cham dyde y• ſynne & not Chanaan
whiche was yet but a childe / why
curſed Noe y• childe Chanaan &
not Cham y• childes fader. ¶Pauper
Noe wolde not curſe Cham in his
owne perſone / for god hadde bleſſyd
hym in his perſone with his brethern
anone after y• flood / & therfore he curſed
Chanaan his ſone / & hym in his

ſone / and punyſſhed hym in his ſone
and all that ſholde come of hym. For
it was goddes dome / that right as he
hadde done ſhame to his fader / ſo his
childern ſholde be ſhame & ſhenſhyp
to hym. And as Noe hadde no Ioye
of hym / ſo ſholde he haue no Ioye of
his childern. ¶Diues. The reaſon is
good & rightfull / ſaye forth. ¶Pauper.

Abſolon the ſone of Dauyd wolde haue

afterwarne Adony was ſlayne for he

               NOt oonly by the cōmaundement
of god ben we boūden

to helpe our fader and our moder / but
alſo by example in kynde as the
mayſtre telleth of propretees. That
whan the ſtorke that is called Ciconia
in latyn / as ſhe hath brought forthe
her byrdes to flyght / both the male
and the female ben bycomen full
feble for trauayl that they had in the

not well helpe theym ſelfe. For both
the male and the female ſytten by dyuer
s;e
tymes on the egges / & chaunge
theyr trauaylle in bredynge of theyr
byrdes / and in fetchyng of mete and
drynke for them ſelfe & for theyr byrdes.
And therfore whan the byrdes
ben growen & may flee / they fetche

be releuyd and may trauayle to helpe
them ſelfe. Alſo he telleth that ther is
a byrde that is called a Pellycane.
Pellicanus. And ther is a grete enemyte
bytwene the Pellycane and the
addre. The addre wayteth whan the
Pellycane hath byrdes / and whan ſhe
is out of the neſte to gete mete to her
and to her byrdes / the addre crepeth
vp in the neſte and ſleeth the byrdes.
And whan the Pellycane cometh ayen
/ and fyndeth her by

                  des ſlayne
in this maner / ſhe mourneth thre
dayes and thre nyghtes for the deth
of her byrdes. The thyrde daye ſhe
ſetteth her ayen ouer her byrdes / and
with her bylle ſhe ſmyteth her ſelfe
in the ſyde / and ſpryngeth her blood
on her byrdes. And by the vertue of
her blood ſhe rayſeth them fro deth
to lyfe. By the bledynge ſhe wexeth
ſo feble that ſhe may not trauayle to
fede her ſelfe. Than ſome of her byrdes
for loue and pyte put them for to
trauayle and fede theyr moder / and
ſome care not for her / but oonly fede
theym ſelfe. Whan the moder is amended
and waxen ſtronge / tho byrdes

caſteth them out of her company.

               DIues. whan man or woman
entreth in to relygyon / he is
deed ayenſt the worlde. Therfore
it ſemeth than that by his relygyon
he is vnbounden from this commaundement
And he that is not boū
                  de
to helpe his fader or moder at nede

he may not gyue / for he y• nought
haue / nought may gyue. ¶Pauper.
Man and woman by this comaundement
is boūde to two thynges / to reuerence
fader & moder / and to helpe
them at nede. As for the reuerence the
relygyouſe is as moche boūde or more
as the ſeculer in tyme & place and
whan and where he may do it. But
as for the ſeconde poynte / that is to
helpe theym at nede / yf his fader and
moder haue not wherby to lyue / ne
be of power to gete theyr lyuynge honeſtly
/ the ſone ought not to entre in
ſuche relygyon there he may not helpe
them / for yf he do he may be cauſe
of theyr deth. But yf his fad & mod
haue ynough to lyue by / he may entre
in to relygyon though fader & moder
forbede it hym. He ſhall not ſpare for
loue / for prayer / for bleſſynge / ne for
curſe. For as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth in
Epla ad Letū. This cōmaūdement
byndeth there that thynges of more
charge & of more prouffyte lette it not
¶Diues. Yet contra te. Yf the relygyouſe
kepe not this cōmaundement
bycauſe of his religyon / he doth amys

in takynge of his relygyon. ¶Pauꝑ
That is ſoth. ¶Diues. I ſuppoſe yt he
neuer after ſee his fader ne moder / ne
do them no helpe ne reuerence / how
kepeth he than this cōmaundement.
¶Pauper. Though he ſee them neuer
after / ne helpe them at nede ne do

to helpe them at nede & to do them reuerence
yf he myght come to them hȳ
                  ſelfe / or by ony perſone / yet he kept ye
cōmaundement. For though this cō
                  maūdement
byndeth alwaye man &
woman / yet it byndeth not for alway
As clerkes tellen / not for euery tyme
ne for euery place / ne for euery cauſe / but
only for ſuche cauſe tyme & place
whan they may do it lefully. And thꝰ

But cōmaundementꝭ negatyfe bynde
euery tyme & for euery tyme. ¶Diues
What yf fader & moder falle in myſchyef
after yt theyr ſone is profeſſed in
relygyon / ought not her ſone to forſake
relygyon & helpe his fader & mod
in theyr myſchyef. ¶Pauper. Some
clerkes tellen yt for as moche as he is
deed ayenſt the worlde by his profeſſyon
/ therfore he is dyſcharged fro cure
of fader & moder / as he is dyſcharged
therof by bodely deth / & he ought not
to go out of his relygyon / but dwelle
ſtyll vnder obedyence of his prelate.
Neuertheleſſe he ought to do his dylygence
to helpe them ſauynge his obedyence

nought haue nought may gyue / but
the relygyouſe maketh ſo his profeſſyon

How ſholde he than helpe eyther

¶Pauper. Yf he be a relygyoꝰ mendycant

And yf he do ſo / without doubte god

And ſo me thynketh that it is ful harde

Saynt Benett ofte with good

Saynt Benett ſayd yt he had nought

yf Saynt Benett hadde hadde ſo
moche moneye of the couent / he ſholde
haue done the ſame with the couentes

For we fynde in the ſame boke / that
ther was a grete hongre in that

And whan he ſawe the folke at myſchyef

than cam a man to hym whos name

goddes ſake to gyue hym a lytyl oyle
Saynt Benett badde the monke that
had the oyle in kepynge / delyuer that
oyle to that nedy man. The monke
for nygardſhyp & for that it was the
couentes good wolde not delyuer it
to the nedy man. For yf he gaue that

Saynt Benett was dyſplayſed
and badde an other monke take the
veſſell of glaſſe with the oyle and caſte
it ought at the wyndowe for that
the monke was ſoo vnobedyent / for

Than ſaynt Benett badde the monkes
take it as it was & gyue it to the

monkes he vndername the cellerer of

ſaynt Bernarde with his bretheren

dyde ſo. The ſame daye he cam ayen

hym gyue the poore man y• dyſſhe / &
ſo he dyd. This poore man was goddes

The relygyous ſayd y• the godes

It is a ſhame & an ouer grete abuſyon

not god. It is better ſayth he to haue
one good childe / than a thouſāde childern
ſhrewes / & better to dye without
than to leue after them ſhrewed childern
Eccl .xvi. For as he ſayth Sapiencie.
.iiij. All the childern that come
of wycked folke ſhall be wytneſſes
of wyckedneſſe ayenſt theyr fader
and moder / whan they ſhall be chalenged
of theyr wyckedneſſe at the dome
For the fader & the moder ſhall
anſwere than for theyr owne wyckedneſſe
and for theyr childerns wyckedne
s;ſe.
But the wyſe man ſayth.
Yf thou haue childern teche theym
well / and bowe them & make theym
ſymple and meke in theyr youth. Yf
thou haue doughters / kepe well theyr
bodyes and honeſtly / but ſhewe them
no gladde chere / be not to homely
with them. Eccl .vij. Whyle a trce is
a ſmalle ſprynge it maye be bowed
as men wyll haue it. But whan it
is full woxen it wyll not be bowed.
So may the childe in the youth with
a lytyll twygge be chaſtyſed and made
lowe and meke. But whan he is
woxen and roted in pryde & in myſuſe
of lyuynge / it is full harde to lowe
hym or to amende hym. And therfor
the wyſe man ſayth. Qui parcit virge
odit fil

                  ū. & qui diligit iliū inſtanter
erudit. Prouer .xiij. He that ſpareth
the yerde hateth his ſone / and he that
loued his ſone techeth hym and chaſtyſeth
hym beſyly. Enſample we haue

foules may ſee fertheſt / and is myghtyeſt

it ſhyneth mooſt bryghteſt without
blemyſſhynge of the eye. And whan

ſhe doth hem loke ayenſt the ſonne.
& tho that loke well ayenſt the ſonne
without blemyſſhynge of ye eye / them
ſhe loueth & cheryſſheth. And them
that wyl not ne may not loke ayenſt
the ſonne / or blemyſſhe theyr eye in ſo
kynge ayenſt the ſonne / ſhe beteth
them and bylleth them. And but yf
they amende them / ſhe caſteth them
out of the neſte / & putteth theym out
of her companye as for none of her
bryddes Thus ſholde faders and moders
teche theyr childern to haue thereyr

/ & take hede to goddes lawe
by enſample of Tobye / whiche ſayd
to his ſone. All the dayes of thy lyfe
haue thou god in mynde / and beware
that thou aſſente to no ſynne / ne
leue not goddes commaundemente.
Tobie .iiij. And therfore Salomon
ſayth. Eccl .vi. That the wycked
man that loketh not vp to the ſonne
of ryghtwyſneſſe is ſo blent with derkene
s;ſe
of ſynne / y• he wote not what
is good neyther what is wycked. And
therfore ſayth he in the next chapytre

wyſdome with rycheſſes is more profytable
than without rycheſſes / & it
profyteth mooſt to them y• ſee the ſonne
/ y• is to ſaye to them y• haue an eye
to the ſonne of ryghtwylneſſe / that is
god. For as Salomon ſayth. Oculi

ſaynt Poule ſayth in the ſame place.

But now god may ſay. Regnauerūt

And therfor ſaynt Auſtyn vpon that

wycked folke to be in this worlde
without cauſe. For euery wycked
man ſayth he / eyther god ſuffreth hȳ
to lyue for to amende hym / or ellys
that good men may be amended by

hym & wynne mede by hym in that
that they ſuffre his malyce pacyently
& trauayll for to amende hym. The
malyce of ſhrewes is a purgatory to
good folke / and ſhrewes ben goddes
ſcourge to chaſtyſe goddes childern
whiche he had ordeyned to the kyngdome
of heuen / and to punyſſhe and
purge the ſynnes of theym that god
loueth / & alſo to punyſſhe other ſhrewes.
And therfor god ſayd to the ſynfull
Iewes. For ye wyll not here my
wordes ne kepe my lawes. Therfore
I ſhall ſende after my ſeruaūt Nabu
godonoſor kyng of Babylon / & brynge
hym & all his people vpon this londe
and deſtroye this londe bycauſe of

donoſor kyng of Babylon was an
hethen man a grete ſhrewe / and had
no loue to god ne knewe hym not for
his god. He was a wycked tyraūt &
deſtroyed goddes lawe and goddes
people & goddes temple in Ieruſalem
And yet god called hym his ſeruaunt
for he was goddes yerge to chaſtyſe
ſhrewes and to punyſſhe the ſynnes
of goddes people. And as ye ſee that
whan as the fader hath beten his childe
with a yerde / he caſteth the yerde
in to the fyre. Right ſoo whan god
hath chaſtyſed & ſcourged his childeren
by wycked men & by wycked tyraūtes
that ben goddes yerde / but yf
the tyraūtes amende them / he ſhall
caſte them in to the fyre of helle with

of temporell lordes & of ther ſouerayn

without leue of his ſouerayne.
And therby he offendeth not his ſouerayn

only in the dedes of the bodye the ſuget

¶Diues. In whiche dedes. ¶Pauꝑ
In ſuche as longeth to reule & gouernaūce

But in thynges yt longe to the

Some thynges be purely

Some be ful wycked of thēſelf / &
tho we be bounde to flee by goddes
lawe without ony byddynge of ony
ſouerayne vnder god. And therfore in
ſuche thynges ſtandeth not proprely
the vertue ne mede of obedyence to
man or woman. Other thynges ther
be that may be good & they may be

wycked / and well do & euyll doo / and
in ſuche thynges ſtandeth proprely obedyence
that men ought to ther ſouerayns.
For in ſuche we ſholde ſtande
to ther wyll & to ther wytte more
than to our owne. For in ſuche ſtandeth
proprely the vertue of obedyence
that we owe to man for goddes ſake.
And the harder yt the cōmaūdemēt be
yf it ſtande with reaſon, the more medefull is the obedyence. For the more
y• man or woman forſaketh his owne

And in frenſhe tōge men of worſhyp
& lordes be called ſenyours & perys

be fads in worſhyp & ought to be worſhypped

For comonly in men of worſhyp is &
ought to be ſadneſſe of wytte & wyſdome
as in men of age / for in them
is the age of wyt & wyſdome / though
they haue no grete age of yeres. And
therfore ſayth Salomon. Senectus

               ALſo leue frende by this commaūdement
we be boūde to

by the pryde of lucyfer myght be
reſtored ayen by ſaluacōn of vs. And
therfore nyght and daye they prayen
for vs to god for helpe and grace nedefull
to vs. Of theſe faders ſpeketh
ſaynt Poule in his pyſtle and ſayth

thus. I knele & praye for you nyght
and daye the fader of our lorde Iheſu
cryſte of whom is named all maner
of faderhede in heuen and in erthe.
Ex quo omnis paternitas nominat
in celo et in terra. ad Ephe .iij. For as
the gloſe ſayth ther dyſpoſycyon the
angellys be our faders in heuen ordeyned
for vs / and in erthe prelates be
our faders hauynge cure and kepynge
of vs. And ſo bothe prelates in erthe
and angellys in heuen ben our faders
And therfore as all theſe clerkes
ſayen. Eche man & woman hath
two angels aſſygned to hym one of
god an other of the fende. For the fonde
Sathanas att goddes ſuffraunce
aſſygneth to hym a wycked angell to
tempte hym and to leſe hym. But
god of his goodnes aſſygneth hym a
good angell to ſaue hym and to kepe
hym. Of whiche good angell cryſte
ſayth in the goſpell / that they ſee
alwaye the face of the fader in heuen
for they be alwaye in his preſence &
ſpeke for vs and praye for vs. And
therfore ſayth ſaynt Ierom vpon the
ſame worde of cryſte / that angels bere
our prayers and our good dedes in
to heuen / and kepe and defende vs ayenſt
the malyce and the ſleyght of
the fende. And therfore the angell
Raphaell / whan he had ledde the ſone
of Tobye in to fer contree and ſaued
hȳ from many perylles & broughte
hym ayen in grete welth / he ſayd
to Tobye / whan thou praydeſt with
bytter teres & beryedeſte the deed bodyes
and lefteſt thy mete and haddeſt
deed bodyes by daye in thyn houſe &
beryeſte them by nyght for goddes ſake
ayenſt the wyll of the wycked kynge
Senacheryb. Than offered I thy
prayer to our lorde god. Thobie .iiij.
Alſo we rede in the fourth booke of
kynges the .vi. chaptre. That the prophete
Helyzee was ſodaynly by nyght
beſyeged in the Cyte of Dothaym
with the ooſt of the kynge of Syrye
In the morowe the ſeruaunt of Helyzee
ſawe the ooſt about the Cyte &
he was full ſory & ſayd to his mayſter
Helyzee. Alas alas alas what ſhal
we do / we be ſo beſyeged with our ennemyes
yt we may not eſcape. Than
Helyzee ſayd to hym. Drede ye not / for
we haue more folke with vs than
they haue with them. Than Helyzee
prayed to god that he wolde open the
eyen of that ſeruaunt / that he myght
ſee what helpe Helyzee had with hym
And anone he ſawe the hylles about
Helyzee full of horſe & charettes brennynge
as fyre & a grete people arayde
to batayll / that was the ooſt of angellys
ſent of god for kepynge of Helyzee
/ through whos helpe the prophete
Helyzee ledde all the ooſt that had
beſyeged hym in to the Cyte of Samarye
amonges all ther enemyes / for
they were ſo blent that they wyſt not
whether they went. They come to take
Helyzee / and Helyzee toke theym
with helpe of angels and dyde with
them what he wolde. And therfor Dauyd
ſayth. Montes in circuitu eius et
dn̄s in circuitu ppli ſui. The hylles / that
is to ſaye / the angellys be about
the good man and the good woman
to kepe them / and god is about his

people to ſaue theym. And therfore
ſaynt Cecyle ſayd to her huſbonde Valaryan
I haue goddes angell that loueth
me full well / and kepeth my bodye
with grete ſuerte that noo man
ſhall defoule me. And yf thou wyll
by foule loue defoule me / he ſhall 
                     •
                  lee
the. And yf thou loue me with clene
loue and wyll kepe my maydenhode
hole & clene / he ſhall loue the as well
as me. And whan thou art cryſtened
thou ſhalt ſee him. Anone her huſbonde
Valeryan by her coūſeyll went and
was cryſtened of the byſſhop ſaynt Vrban
And whan he was cryſtened / he
cam ayen & foūde ſaynt Cecyle prayenge
in cloſet / & the angell ſtandynge
beſydes her with wynges & fethers ful
bryght / & his face ſhone & glymered
as the flāme of fyre. He had in eyther
hande a garlonde made of roſes & lelyes
full fayre & treſſhe and full ſwete
in ſmellynge. He gaaf vnto ſaynt
Cecyle one an other to Valeryan and
bad them kepe them in clennes both
of bodye & of ſoule. For why ſayd he
I haue brought thē out of paradyſe
And ye ſhall knowe by this token / for
they ſhall alwaye be grene & freſſhe / &
neyther welke ne fade / ne leſe ther
ſwete ſauour / and no man ne woman
may ſee them / but they that loue clenne
s;ſe
and chaſtyte as ye doo. We rede
alſo in the lyfe of ſaynt Agnes that
whan ſhe was but .xiij. yere of age / ſuffered
deth for the loue of god / and
for the loue of chaſtyte / fo
                     •
                   ſhe wolde
not aſſent to be wedded to the grete
lordes ſone of Rome / for he was hethen.
And alſo for ſhe wolde kepe her
mayndenhode to cryſte. She was made
naked & ledde to the bordell houſe
to be defouled of ſynfull wretches.
But ſodaynly her here wexe ſoo moche
that it hylled and hydde all her
bodye. And whan ſhe cam to the bordell
houſe her good angell was redy
and brought her a clothe as whyte as
ſnowe full mete to her bodye / and be
lapped her with ſo grete lyght yt ther
myght no man loke vpon her / ne no
man durſte entre the place. Thanne
the lordes ſone as ful hardy ran in to
that lyght for to defoule her. And anone
the fende whom he wolde haue
ſerued / ſlough hym. But ſaynt Agnes
with her prayer to god and helpe
of her good angell reyſed hym from
deth to lyfe / to ſhame & ſhenſhyp of
all hethen people. For anone he went
out of that houſe & cryed openly that
there was no god but cryſte / and deſſpyſed
her mawmettes and ther falſe
byleue. Alſo whan ſaynt Agace was
buryed / her angell in the lykeneſſe of
a yonge man clothed in clothe of ſylke
with an hondred yonge men al clothed
in whyte / that were angels alſo / or
ellys holy ſoules came to the beryenge
& layde a ſtone of marble vpon
her graue with a wrytynge of grete
confort to all y• contre / & went not
thens tyll all the buryenge was do / &
neuer after was ſee ony of all that cō
                  pany
Alſo the good angell brake the
wheles that ſholde haue ſlayne ſaynt
Katheryne. And whan ſhe was deed
for goddes ſake y• angels toke her bodye
& bare it in the erthe in to y• moū
                  te
of Synay & ther buryed it worſhyp

fully. And therfor leue frende I praye
you y• ye haue ſayntes in heuen & holy
angels in reuerence & deuocyon / for
they be to vs fader & moder as I ſayde
fyrſte. Worſhyp ye our lady moder
& mayde aboue all next after god / &

that is fader of all & ſouerayne Iuge
to queme hym and to praye for vs to

ſayth. Pro hac .id eſt ꝓmiſſione peccati

Euery ſaynt ſhall praye to the

praye ye hertely to your angell as

               ALſo good frende ye ſhall vnderſtande

whan they wyll rebelle ayenſt theyr

that people is able to the ſwerde

longe as y• rote of the tree kepeth him

¶Diues. This is full ſoth / we ſee it

& pryde was pryncypal cauſe

And pryncypally the cauſe of ſaluacyon
of realmes londes & comontees

is obedyence & buxumneſſe that eche
man in his degree obeye to his ſouerayn
& worſhyp hym as fader. And
therfore leue frende I praye you for

& worſhyp ye the age that ye drawe

be yf ye abyde theyr age / feble vnourne

ye be now ſuche were they ſomtyme.
It fareth by age of man & woman
as it doth by a precyous ſtone yt is called
cryſolitus. This ſtone as the mayſter
ſayth of kyndes in the begynnynge
of the daye it ſhyneth bryght as
ony golde / but as the daye paſſeth ſo
paſſeth his bryghtneſſe / & the nerer
euen the more it fadeth / ſo y• by euen
it is lyke a clot of erth. Thus fareth
by man & woman in this worlde. For
in theyr youth & in theyr begynnyng
they be fayre rede & rody and freſſhe
as a roſe in May full luſty to the eye
But as youth paſſeth ſo paſſeth ther
beaute. And as they olde / ſo they fade
tyll at the laſte the daye of theyr lyfe
cometh to an ende / and than be they
but a clot of erth full vnourne & gaſtely
to the ſyght.

wycked werke / he layeth his pelowe
vnder his elbowe. And he that gladdeth
the herte of the ſynner in his ſynne
he layeth a pelowe vnder his hede
For by the hede is vnderſtande y• her

For why by ſuche flaterynge they
reſte ſoftely & ſlepe in theyr ſynne &
deye ghooſtly without payne and perceyue
not her owne deth And therfor
Salomon ſayth. That he that Iuſtefyeth
the wycked man & dampned
the ryghtful man / both they be abhomynable
to god. Prouer .xvij. Therfore
god lykeneth flaterers to theym
that playſtren & paynten walles and
wowes without. For thynge that is
foule they make it to ſeme fayre and
make folke to haue lykynge in her
ſynnes. Therfore god ſayth that the
ſynner maketh the walle of ſynne bytwene hym & god. But flaterers playſteren and paynten the walle of ſynne.
Eze .xiij. Alſo flaterers be lykened
to an adder that is called dypſa whiche
as the mayſter of kyndes ſayth▪ li.
xviij. He is ſo lytyll that though a
man trede theron he may not ſee it.
But his venym is ſo vyolent that it
ſleeth a man or he fele it / & he deyeth
without payne. Ryght ſo flaterynge
ſemeth but a ſmall ſynne / & yet it is
full venemous & ſleeth mannes ſoule
or he fele it / and without payne bryngeth hym to endeles payne. Flaterers
be lykened to an adder that is called
tyrus whiche is leſte of all adders / &
yet his venym is not curable as ſayth
the mayſter of kynde in the ſame place
Ryght ſo flaterynge ſemeth but a
full lytyll ſynne / and yet it is ſo venemous yt it wyll not lyghtly be heled.
For whan a man or woman hath lykynge
in flaterynge & ruleth his lyfe
after flaterynge tonge / it is full harde
to that man or woman to be ſaued.
For as longe as men pra
                     •

                  olde in
his ſynne. And yf men begynne to
lacke hym / he falleth in to ſorowe &
dyſpayre. Therfore ſayth ſaynt Iames.
That the tonge is but a lytyll
membre / and reyſeth vp grete dyſeaſe
it is a wycked thynge that hath noo
reſte full of dedely venym. Iacobi. iij.
And the prophete Dauyd ſayth. Acuerunt linguas ſuas ſicut ſerpentes. venenū aſpidum ſub labijs eo
                     
                        
                     
                     rum
                  . They
haue ſharped her tonges as addres / the
venym of addres is vnder the lyppes
of flaterers and wycked ſpekers.
And yf a man doo his dedes only for
to be praſed and flatered of the people
/ flaterynge is his mede. And
whan flaterynge ceſſeth and the wynde
tourneth ayenſt hym / he hath noo
lenger lykynge in good dedes. And
ſo as the goſpell ſayth / for that he ſeketh
thanke in prayſynge onely of
man for his good dedes & not of god
Therfore all ſuche be lykened to the
fyue maydens foles that wolde mete
with theyr huſbonde cryſte Iheſu at
the dome with lampes without oyle.
That is to ſaye / wt good dedes without ghooſtly myrthe and Ioye & conſcyence.
For they had no Ioye in ther
good dedes / but in prayſynge and flaterynge
of the people. And therfore
cryſte ſayth in the goſpell. They haue
take ther mede in this worlde / and
at the dome they ſhall be ſhette out
of heuen blyſſe from endeles mede / bothe
flaterers & they that haue lykynge
in flaterynge / and do ther dedes
only for flaterynge & prayſynge

of the people. But the fyue wyſe may
dens as the goſpell ſayth hadden oyle
in theyr lampes. That is to ſaye
ghooſtly Ioye & lykynge in her good
dedes. And therfore they ſhall be reſceyued
of ther huſbonde cryſte in to y•
blyſſe without ende. And as ſaynt Auſten
ſayth in his ſermon / by oyle is
vnderſtande both ghooſtly prayſynge
and worldely prayſynge and myrthe
Ghooſtly prayſynge & ghooſtly myrthes
is called the oyle of y• holy gooſt
But worldely pryſynge and worldely
myrthe is called the oyle of ſynners.
And therfore he ſayth that flaterers
ſelle oyle to the maydens folys / that
is to ſaye to ſynners as often as they
flater them & prayſe theym in theyr
foly & in ther pryde for to haue mete
or drynke or moneye or worſhyp / or
ony temporall lucre / & ſo brynge them
in errour & foly and pleaſe & prayſe
theym in ther ſynne. But as Dauyd
ſayth. Deus diſſipauit oſſa eo

god & deſceyue men & wemen by flaterynge
/ wycked tonges do moche harme
and ſlee many ſoules / but the flaterynge
tonge is worſte of all. And
therfore the wyſe man ſayth. Suſurto

Eccl .xxviij. The muſterer & the double
tonged man ſhall be acurſed of

It is a preuy rowner / that

Of whiche folke ſaynt Poule ſayth.
Suſurrones detractores deo odibiles.
Ad Romanos .i. Suche muſterers &
bachyters god hateth them. For ſuſurro
is a preuy bachyter and a preuy
lyer that maketh debate amonges
frendes. And as the wyſe man ſayth.
God hateth all tho that ſowen dyſcorde
amonges bretheren & frendes.
Prouer .vi. And as he ſayth in an other
place / ſuche preuy muſterers defoule
ther ſoule / and they ſhall be hated
of all both of god & of al the courte
of heuen. Eccl .xxi. And therfor god
ſayth. Non eris ſuſurro nec criminator
in populis. Thou ſhalt be no muſterer
amonges the people to lette leue

teller ne blabbe to defame man or woman
falſely or ony ſynne that is preuy.
Leuitici .xix. Suche preuy muſterers

therfore whan they be knowen for ſuche

¶Pauper. Bilinguis and the double
tonged man is he that ſayth one

good before a man / and behynde

the mouthe that is double tonged.
¶Diues. What called the wyſe man
the thyrde tonge that doth ſo moche
woo. ¶Pauper. The thyrde tonge
is the flaterynge tonge whiche is the
worſte of all. For euery flaterer that
flatereth man or woman in his ſynne
/ he is a flaterer / he is a bachyter / he
is a double tonged / and ſo he may be
called in latyn trilinguis / that is treble
tonged in Englyſſhe. The flaterer
blyndeth ſo the folke that he flateret
/ that they take no hede to theymſelfe
ne to god / ne knowe not themſelf
& waxe ſo proude that they gyue
no tale of ther euen cryſten. Alſo the
flaterer lacketh and bachyteth al tho
that he hateth / whom he flatereth ſo
to pleaſe hym / & hyndereth an other
mannes name to enhaunce his name
and ſo maketh dyſcorde & dyſcencōn
Alſo flaterers be double tonged. For
as lyghtely as they prayſen man or
woman / as lyghtely they wyll lacke
theym yf they fayle of ther purpoſe
and haue no lucre by ther flaterynge
as they wende haue had. For comonly
grete prayſers be grete lackers / and
as moche as they prayſe man or woman
out of meſure by flaterynge / as
moche they wyll lacke hȳ or an other
by bachytyng. Therfor Seneca ſayth
Lauda parce. vitupera perciꝰ. Prayſe
ſcarſely / but lacke more ſcarſely. For
theſe reaſons Salomon ſayth / that
the thyrde tonge hath ſtyred moche in
to pryde / and ſo made them falle in
ſhame and ſhenſhyp and dyſparpled
them fro nacyon to nacyon. It hath
deſtroyed walled townes / & dolue vp
the houſes of grete lordes. It hath kyt
awaye the myght and the vertue of
people that were full ſtronge and made
them feble. For flaterers make
townes nacyons & lordes bolde to be
gynne warres / plees & debate / by whiche
they come to nought. For they be
ſo blent by flaterynge and ouerprayſynge
that they knowe not themſelf / but
wene to ouerlede all men tyll att
the laſte they be deſtroyed themſelfe.
Alſo as the wyſe man ſayth / the thyr
de tonge hath caſte ſtronge woman / that
is to ſaye good weman ſyker &
vertuous out of ther vertue / and pryued
theym and put them from theyr
trauayles. For whan a good woman
hath trauayleth moche of hyr lyfe to
pleaſe god & to haue a good name / cometh
a falſe flaterer in gyle & with
flaterynge wordes and fayre byheſtes
of matrymony / or of rycheſſes bryngeth
hyr to ſynne & dooth hyr to leſe

hyr good name & bryngeth hyr to ſhame
& velony. And therfore ſayth the
wyſe man in the ſame place. Eccleſi.
xxviij. That who ſoo taketh hede to
the flaterynge tonge / that is the thyr
de tonge to haue lykynge therin / he
ſhall neuer haue reſte. And he ſhall
haue no frende in whom he may reſte
ne truſte / for flaterers be no true frendes
/ but all blynde as men that they
may not knowe ther frendes / ne take
hede to the ſpeche of theyr frendes yt
wolde ſaye theym the ſoche & warne
theym of ther harme.

               DIues. That many a good

pled them from nacyon to nacyon I
ſee not / but I praye the telle ſome enſample.
¶Paup. As we fynde in the
fourth boke of kynges & the boke of
Ieremye. For the childern of Iſraell
wolde not here y• wordes of Ieremye
& of other true prophetes / ne do there
after / but had lykynge in flaterynge
of falſe ꝓphet whiche behyght them
welth & proſperyte for to pleſe the people
/ therfore was the cyte of Ieruſalē
deſtroyed & nyghe all the cytees and
caſtellys of the londe. The kynge ſedechye
was taken & his childern ſlayne
byfore hym / and after his eyen were
put out. All the lordes & the gentyles
of the londe eyther they were ſlayne
or ellys ledde pryſoners in to Babyloyn.
The people was ſlayne with
honger moreyn and ſwerde. And all
tho that were lefte a lyue after yt the
cyte of Ieruſalē was taken were dyſparpled
in dyuerſe nacyons / & ſlayne
in dyuerſe maner / for they truſted alwaye
in flaterynge of falſe prophetes
and ſloughe Ieremye & other good
prophetes that ſayd them the truthe
and wolde haue ſaued them. And I
dare ſaye that flaterynge of falſe prophetes
& precho
                     •
                  rs / and of other ſpekers
that blynde the people with pleſaunt
leſynges / ne wyll not vndo to

cauſe of deſtruccōn of many realmes
londes people & cytees vnto this daye
as we myght ſee at eye yf flaterynge
and leſynges blent vs not. ¶Diues.
Men preche theſe dayes ful wel ayenſte
ſynne. ¶Pauper. Some do ſo / but
ayenſt the grete ſynne yt all the londe
is entryked in / & all cryſtendome knoweth
& is open cauſe of our myſcheef
ayenſt that no man precheth but nyghe
al be about to maynten it. ¶Diues
Whiche ſynne is that ¶Pauper
Often haue I tolde the / but y• byleueſt
me not. Go ouer the ſee & there men
ſhall telle it the yf y• axe. We fynde in
the thyrde boke of kynges / yt the kynge
of Iſraell whos name was Achab
was ſtyred to beſyege the cyte of Ramathygalaad
& ſo begynne warre ayenſt
the kyng of Syrye / this Achab
ſent after. iiij. hondred falſe flaterynge
ꝓphetes of his londe / whiche were
wont to pleſe hym & to flater hym &
axed them counſeyll & how he ſholde
ſpede. They flatered hym all & bad
hym go and fyght / and ſayd that he

ſholde ſpede ryght well & take the cyte
and deſtroye all the londe of Syrye.
Than at the counſeyll of Ioſephat
the kynge of Iuda yt was come
to helpe hym / he ſent for Michee goddes
ꝓphete to knowe what he wolde
ſaye. And as he came towardes y• kyng
/ the meſſangere ſayd to Michee the
prophete. All other ꝓphetes with one
mouth telle our lorde the kynge good
tydynges & ſaye that he ſhall ſpede
ryght well. I praye the ſaye as they
ſaye. Than the prophete anſwered / what
my lorde god ſayth to me / that
ſhall I ſpeke to our lorde the kynge.
And whan he came byfore the kynge
he ſayd to the kynge Achab. I ſawe
by vyſon all the people of Iſrael dyſſpar
                     •
                  led
in y• hylles & ſcatered aboue
as ſhepe without a ſhepeherde. Anon
the kynge was wroth & ſayd that he
tolde hȳ neuer good ne welth. Than
the prophete ſayd. Here the worde of
god. I ſawe our lorde god ſyttynge
on his ſete / and all the ooſt of heuen
ſtandynge beſydes hym on the ryght
ſyde & on the lyfte ſyde. Than ſayd
our lorde god. Who ſhal deſceyue Achab
kynge of Iſraell to do hym goo
& fyght in Ramath
                     •
                  galaad & fall in
fyght. Anone a wycked ſpyryte ſtode
forth & ſayd. I ſhall deſceyue hym.
Than our lorde axed hym how he
ſholde deſceyue hym. I ſhall ſayd he
go out & be aſpryte lyer in the mouth
of all his falſe prophetes. Than our
lorde god ſayd. Thou ſhalt deſceyue
hym & thou ſhalt haue the mayſtrye
of hym. Go forth & do as thou haſte
ſayd. Than the kyng was more wrothe
and cōmaunyed hym to pryſone.
The kynge lefte the counſeyll of the
prophete Michee & folowed the counſeyll
of his falſe prophetes / and went
to batayle & was ſlayne / and his people
dyſcounfyted. ¶Diues. Dauyd
ſpeketh moche in his boke of the gylous
tonge / that is called in latyn. lin
gua doloſa. ¶Pauper. The gylous
tonge is the flaterynge tonge. For comonly
euery gy
                     •
                  e in ſpeche is medled
with flaterynge. In gylous ſpeche
be two thynges / ſleyght & flaterynge
And therfor gylous ſpeche is lykened
to an anglynge of fyſſhe. For in the
anglynge be two thynges / the hoke &
the mete on the hoke. The hoke is the
ſleyght in ſpeche / the mete on the hoke
is flaterynge that draweth man
and woman on to the deuylles hoke.
Thus Adam & Eue were dyſceyued
with y• fendes ſpeche / for ſlyly he axed
Eue why god bad yt they ſholde not
ete of euery tree in paradyſe. And
whan he ſawe her vnſtable & doubtynge
he put therto y• mete of flaterynge
& ſayd / yt they ſholde not deye but be
as goddes konwynge good & wycked
And ſo by flaterynge the fende loſte
all mankynde. Fygure here of we haue
in y• ſeconde boke of kynges.xx.ca.
where we fynde yt Ioab gylouſly ſloughe
the noble prynce Amaſam with a
knyfe craftely made lyghtly to go out
of the ſhethe. And whan he ſholde ſteke
hym with the knyfe he toke hym
by the chynne and ſayd to hym heyle
my brother. And for his flaterynge &
fayre wordes Amaſa toke no hede to

whan Iudas betrayed cryſte he ſayd

¶Pauper. Thre thynges be nedefull

ſkynne that hylleth & clothe the fleſſhe

of this we haue in the thyrde boke of

That is ſothe. And therfore cryſte

That is to ſaye fede my lambes and
my ſhepe that be tho ſoules that cryſt

and curates of holy chirche muſte fede
ther ſugettes by good enſamples

therfore cryſte ſayd twyes to ſaynt Peter
/ fede my lambes / but the thyrde
tyme he ſayd / fede my ſhepe. For as
longe as they be lambes / they gyue
neyther mylke ne wolle / but whan
theſe be waxen ſhepe / they gyue bothe

gooſtly and alſo bodely with bodely

to fede the ryche folke but gooſtly

chirches goodes. And of the poore
folke gyue they no tale / but to pylle
them / and haue of them / and gette of
theym what they may by ypocreſy / by
fraude / by drede and vyolence. And
therfore god vndernemeth theym by
the prophete Ezechyell and ſayth to

Woo be to the ſhepeherdes of Iſraell
That is to ſaye to the prelates & curates

And therfore god accepteth not the
prayer of ſuche men of holy chirche.
For they be without charyte and full
of crueltee in pyllynge of the poore

For the hande of the ſhedder is cauſe

By whiche thynges or by the pryſe of

Alſo all thoo that withholde poore

And the preeſt may be ſo good / that

¶Diues. Why declared he thē

gyuen many mo whan he gaue but

many was not profytable / ne to gyue

and all is comprehended in ten
byheſtes that ben ſo knytte to gydre / &
of ſo grete acorde / that who ſo treſpaceth

And therfore ſayth ſaynt Iames in

all the lawe / & he offende in one he is
gylty in all. For why ſayth he / god y•
bad the do no lecherye / he bad the not
ſlee. And therfore ſayth he. Though
thou do no lecherye & y• ſlee / thou breke
s;te
the lawe. Iacovi .i. For as ſaynt
Auſten ſayth in libro de decem cordis
All the ten cōmaūdementes be conteyned
in the two cōmaundementes of
charyte. And the two cōmaūdement
of charyte be conteyned & knytte in
this one cōmaūdement of kynde. Od

That yt thou wylt not be doo
to the do it not to an other. And ſo as
ſaynt Auſten ſayth there. All the lawe
is conteyned in this one cōmaūdement
of kynde. That thou wylt not

be do to the / do it thou not to none other.
And ſo nedes he that offendeth
in one offendeth in all. And therfore
Dauyd and ſaynt Auſten alſo calle
goddes lawe a ſawtree and an harpe
of ten cordys. And therfore Dauyd
byddeth vs prayſe god in the harpe / &
in the ſawtree of ten cordys. That
is to ſaye in good kepynge of the ten
cōmaundementes. Confitemini domino
in cithara in pſalterio decē cordarum
pſallite illi. And yf it be ſo / yt
one corde in the ſawtree or in the harpe
be broke / or out of tune of a corde
with other cordes / all the ſonge that
played therin ſhall be vnlykynge to
all that here it and not pleaſaūt. As
the mayſter of kynde telleth Li .xviij.
That though the harpe be well ſtrynged
with ſtrynges made of a ſhepe / and
ther be one ſtrynge that is made
of a wolfe ſette in the harpe / it ſhall
make all other at dyſcorde. So that
they ſholde not accorde whyle it is
there. And it ſhall frete atwo all the
other cordys. Right ſo though a man
or a woman kepe well all the cōmaū
                  dementes
as to mannes ſyght / yf he
breke one he is gylty in all in goddes

to god. And the ſonge of his harpe
/ that is his lyuynge & his conuerſacyon
is at dyſcorde with god and
all the courte of heuen / & as the wolfe
is alwaye contrarye and enmye to

as y• kepeſt well the ten beheſtys in

thou folowe the maners of the wolfe

¶Pauper. Yf yt treſpace in
manſlaughter / yu creſpaceſt ayenſt all

god / in y• that yu brekeſt his cōmaūdement
/ and ſo defoule his ymage. Alſo
yu takeſt in vayne his name / that
is cryſte and cryſten. For thou dooſt
not as a cryſten man ſholde do. Alſo
thou haloweſt not from ſynne as god
bad the by the thyrde cōmaūdement.
Alſo thou deſpyſeſt and not worſhyp
peſte fader and moder / that be god
and holy chirche / and thy bodely fad
& moder. For thy wycked tatches be
ſhame & ſhenſhyp to thy fader and
moder. Alſo thou dooſt lecherye in y•
that thou loueſt thy wycked wyll and
thy malyce more than god. And for
to haue thy wycked wyl perfourmed
thou forſakeſt god and takeſt thy ſoule
to the deuyl. For what thynge that
man loueth more than god / with that

thynge he dooth gooſtly lechery and
fornycacyon & auoutre. Alſo yu bereſte
falſe wytneſſe & lyeſt many leſynges
to mayntene thy ſynne / or ellys to hyde
it. Alſo yu ſteleſt thy ſoule & his ſoule
whom yu ſleeſt fro god that bought
hym ſo dere. Alſo whan thou ſleeſt
thou dooſt ayenſt the nynthe and the
tenthe cōmaūdement. For euery man
ſlaughter is do for couetyſe of vengeaunce
/ or for couetyſe of erthely good
or for couetyſe of fleſſhely luſte / as of
mennes wyues / or of theyr childern / or
of theyr ſeruauntes / or for couetyſe

eche of all ten / that he that breketh
one breketh all / & he yt is gylty in one
dedely ſynne is gylty in al ſeuen / & in

And yet as ſaynt Auſten ſayth in the

cōmaundement of kynde byddeth vs

why all we be goddes ſeruaūtes. And
yf y• haddeſt a ſeruaunt ſayth ſaynt

no man ſholde defoule thy wyfe / defoule

ſpouſe ne none other ſoule. Thou
woldeſt that no man ſholde deſtroye
thyn houſe ne defoule it / defoule thou
not than goddes temple / that is euery
clene cryſten ſoule. Defoule it not
by lecherye ne by no dedely ſynne. For
ſaynt Poule ſayth / that who ſo defouleth
goddes temple / god ſhall deſtroye

that no man deſpyſe thyn ymage

paynted on a borde / deſpyſe thou
not goddes ymage by ony dedely ſynne
For ſythen thou may not pleaſe
god in ſynne and ſhrewedneſſe / therfore
yu offendeſt thy god in thy ſynne

We fynde that Balaam rode on his

ſayd. For thou haſte well deſerued it / wolde

Sythen than it is ſo y• Balaam was

It is graunted to man to ſlee beſtes

whan he forbadde man to ete fleſſhe

For I ſhall ſeke the blood of youre

                  .xi. He bad them
not lerne to playe with the ſwerde / ne

ſhote to ſlee ther enemyes / but he bad
theym lerne to be lowe and meke of
herte and to lyue in pacyence as lambes

them loue ther enemyes and do good
to them that hate them. Mat
                     •
                  .v. He
hadde them ſhewe pacyence peas and

pyte / not only in worde wyl and dede
but he bad them abſteyne them from
all tokenes of vnpacyence of vnpeas
and of crueltee. And for that ſheddynge
of blood and manſlaughter is
ofte token of vnpacyence and vnpeas
of wrath and of cruelte in them that
ſleen and dyſpoſeth them to crueltee.
Therfore cryſte forbadde the ſwerde
to alle the mynyſtres of the aulter.
¶Diues. Telle me ſome other reaſon.
¶Pauper. An other reaſon is
this. For the ſacrament of the aulter
that the preſtes make by the vertu of
cryſtus worde is a ſacrament of charyte
& of onehede. For it repreſenteth
the onehede that is bytwene cryſte &
holy chirche. And alſo it repreſenteth
the onehede of the ſoule with the bodye.
For as the ſoule quyckeneth the
bodye / ſo cryſte by y• ſacrament of the
aulter quyckeneth holy chirche & mā
                  nes
ſoule. Alſo it repreſenteth y• onehede
of y• godhede with our manhede
in cryſte / & therfore holy chirche ſayth
thus. Nam ſicut aīa racionalis et cato

                     •
                  s.
Ryght as reaſonable ſoule & the fleſſhe
is one man / ſoo god and the man
is one cryſte / and one cryſte is bothe
god & man. And therfore he that deſtroyeth
the onehede of the ſoule with
the bodye & departeth them atweyne
by manſlaughter / he ſheweth not in
hymſelfe ne in his dede the ſacramente
of onehede of cryſte with holy chirche
& of the godhede with the manhede
in cryſte. But he dooth ayenſt that
ſacrament by ſperacyon & dyuyſyon
that he maketh in manſlaughter and
ſheddynge of blood. And therfore he
is yrreguler & vnable to make the ſacrament
of the aulter. And for the ſame
reſon yf a man haue wedded two
wyues & ſo departeth his fleſſhe in dyuer
s;e
wymen / he is yrreguler & vnable
to the aulter. And therfore not only
preſtes / but dekenes and ſubdekenes
in that they be aſtent to the preeſt
in makynge of the ſacrament muſte
be without ſuche departynge that is
contrarye to the ſacrament of endeles
charyte & of onehede bytwene god
and holy chirche & bytwene all good
cryſten people y• is in charyte for alle
they be one & come togydre in this ſacrament
For this reſon it is not leful
to men of holy chirche to ſhed mānes
blood / ne to ſlee ne to mayme. The
newe teſtament is a lawe of loue / &
therfore cryſte wolde yt the mynyſtres
of the auter in ye newe teſtament that
ſholde mynyſtre the ſacrament of his
endeles loue & of his endles mercy to
mankynde / that they ſhewe loue / mercy
& pyte / & no token of cruelte. The
olde teſtament was a lawe of drede
& dureſſe / and nygh all the ſacrefyces
that the preſtes made was done with
ſhedynge of blood / not only in fygure
of cryſtus paſſyon / but alſo in token yt
he yt ſynned was worthy to be ſlayne
as the beeſt that was ſlayne / that
was offered for his ſynne. And therfore
the ſwerde was graunted to preſtes
and to the mynyſtres of the olde
lawe to punyſſhe rebellours whan it
nedeth / and moche of theyr offyce
was to ſhedde blood. And ſo by theyr
offyce they were dyſpoſed to crueltee.

In ſoo moche that they were not afrede
to flee goddes ſone ther lorde / ther
ſouerayne / & ther god. And for
that preſtes of the olde lawe by cruelte
ſlough cryſte god and lorde of all.
Therfore ſhedynge of blood & manſlaughter
is forboden to preſtes in the
newe lawe and maketh them vnable
to the aultre that ſhedde mannes blode
or helpe therto.

as we rede in the goſpell. Cryſte bad

Qui non habet vendat tunicam ſuā.

hath no ſwerde ſelle his cote and bye

ſayd tho wordes not to all his apoſtles
/ but to Iudas the traytoure not
byddynge hym bye him a ſwerde / but
ſo ſhewynge & ſaynge byfore the wycked

Iudas was in to begge a ſwerde to come

And therfore cryſte ſayd not tho wordes
in the plurell nombre / as to many
but in the ſynguler / as to one Iudas
alone. For he only was in purpoſe to
betray hym / and to begge hym a ſwerde
for drede of knockes. And by tho

For as I ſayd. The appoſtles

vnderſtode not why ne to whom cryſte
ſayd tho wordes. And therfor they
wende as moche folke weneth yet yt
cryſte hadde bode theym haue bought
ſwerdes for to fyght. And therfore
they anſwered in that maner / and
began to ſpeke of ſwerdes & of fyghtynge.

with ther ſpeche and badde them
be ſtylle of ſuche ſpeche. Satis eſt. It

ſayth in the ſame place / they ceſſed

of holy chirche two ſwerdes / bothe
ghooſtely ſwerde and bodely ſwerde.
¶Pauper. They erre as the apoſtles

to whom cryſte ſayd tho wordes. For
cryſte graūted neuer too clerkes the
bodely ſwerde to ſhedde blood but he
forbad it to theym in the ſame tyme
whan he vndernam Peter ſmytynge
with the ſwerde and badde hym put
it vp his ſwerde in to the ſhethe. For
why ſayth he / who that ſmyteth with
the ſwerde / he ſhall peryſſhe with the
ſwerde. And ſo all the proceſſe of the
goſpell yf men vnderſtode it well / ſheweth
that cryſte hath forboden men

of goddes worde that Peter ſpake
and the holy gooſt by Peter. For as
ſaynt Poule ſayth / the ſwerde of goddes
worde full often departeth y• ſoule

of holy men and of men of holy

for to pleaſe the people & for drede yt

ſythen hethen lawe ſledth noo man

for to go the ſooner to heuen. For

yf he ſlee hymſelfe as the lawe ſayth

And he falleth in ouer greuous ſynne.
And in that yt he ſleeth hymſelf he
falleth in wanehope & dooth deſpyte

For after his deth he may not amende
hym of yt greuous ſynne of manſlaughter.
And by yt manſlaughter he
ſleeth his lyf in this worlde & his lyf

ther ſholde noo woman ſlee hyrſelfe

For as ſaynt Lucye ſayth to y• tyraūt

And leſſe ſynne it is to fall in lechery

To ſlee hyr by lawe cyuyle there

For the fyrſte cauſe it was ordeyned

out of paradyſe after Adams

none other. The ſeconde is bryngyng
forth & nouryſſhynge of children to y•
worſhyp of god & to goddes ſeruyce
For ellys it were better that they were
vnborne. The thyrde is y• ſacrament
whiche may not be vndo but only by
deth. And therfore the ordre of wedloke
is full worſhypfull / for it repreſenteth
y• grete ſacrament of vnyte & of
endles loue bytwene y• godhede & the

& bytwene cryſte & cryſten ſoule. And
the faythfull loue yt ought to be bytwene
huſbonde & wyfe betokeneth
the loue & the fayth yt ought to be bytwene
cryſte & cryſten ſoule & bytwene
cryſte & holy chirche. For the huſbonde
ſholde loue his wyfe with true
loue. And therfore whan he weddeth
hyr / he ſetteth a rynge on hyr fynger
whiche rynge is a token of true loue
that ought to be bytwene them. For
they muſte loue them togydre hertely
and therfore it is ſette in the fourthe
fynger For as clerkes ſay fro yt fynger
god gyueth hyr but one rynge in token
that they ſholde loue theymſyngulerly
togydre. For as ayenſt comynynge
of the body / the huſbonde ſholde
loue his wyfe and none other / and
the wyfe hyr huſbonde & none other.
The rynge is roūde about and hath
none ende in token yt ther loue ſholde
be endeles / & no thynge departe them
but deth alone. Alſo the rynge is made
of golde or of ſyluer in token that
as golde and ſyluer paſſeth all other
metals in value and clenneſſe / ſo ſholde
ther loue paſſe al other loues. And
the huſbonde loue his wyfe paſſynge
all other wymen / and the wyfe loue
hyr huſbonde paſſynge all other men
And as golde and ſyluer paſſeth all
other metals in clennes / ſo ſholde ther
loue al be ſet in clennes & not comon
togydre / but for bryngynge forth of
childern or to flee fornycacōn or to yelde
the dette of ther bodyes. This loue
betokeneth the loue yt we owe to god
that is our gooſtly huſbonde to whome
we be all wedded in onr baptem.
For we ſholde loue hym hertely with
all our herte ſyngulerly / with all our

And therfore ſayth he Deutronoꝰ .vi.

woman more of the rybbe of Adam
than of an other bone. ¶Pauꝑ. For
the rybbe is next the herte in token yt
god made hyr to be mānes felowe in
loue & his helper. And as the rybbe is
next the herte of all bones / ſoo ſholde
the wyf be next in loue of all wymen
& of al men. God made not woman
of the fote to be mannes thrall / ne he
made hyr not of the hede to be his

to be his felowe in loue & helper at
nede. But Whan Eue ſynned / than

& drede hym and ſerue hym as
felowe in loue & helper at nede / & as

boūde in vyleyne ſeruage. For y• huſbonde
ought to haue his wyfe in reuerence
& worſhyp in yt they be both one
fleſſhe & one blood. ¶Diues. Why made
not god woman by hyrſelfe of the
erthe as he dyd Adam. ¶Pauꝑ. For
to encreaſe ther loue to gydre / & alſo
to gyue woman mater of loweneſſe.
Fyrſte for encreaſynge of loue / for in
yt woman is parte of mannes bodye / man
muſte loue hyr as his owne fleſſhe
& blood. And alſo ſhe muſte loue
man as hyr begynnyng & as hyr fleſſhe
& hyr blood. Alſo ſhe ought to take
grete mater of lowneſſe / & thynke
that man is hyr perfeccyon & hyr begynnynge
& haue man in reuerence
as hyr perfeccōn / as hyr pryncypal / as
hyr begynnynge & hyr fyrſte in ordre

it is more ſynne in the man.
For the hygher degre y• harder is the

falle & the ſynne more greuous. Alſo
man is more myghty by waye of kynde
to withſtande & hath more reaſon
wherby he may withſtande & beware
of the fendes gyle. And in that he is
made mayſter & gouernour of womā

to eche of them in this maner. God
ſayth to the yu ſhalt do no lecherye yt

but with the wyfe. Thou axeſt
this of thy wyfe that ſhe medle with
none but with the. And therfore thou
oughteſt to be byfore thy wyfe in vertue
/ yu falleſt downe vnder the fylthe
of lecherye. Thou wylt yt thy wyfe be
ouercomer of lecherye & haue y• mayſtrye

And notwithſtandyng that thou

of thy wyfe gooſt bacwarde to helle
Man ſayth he is hede of woman / &
therfore in what houſholde the woman

For ſyth man is hede of woman / he
ought to lyue better than woman &
go byfore his wyfe in all good dedes / that

it is ſelden ſeen. ¶Pauꝑ. And yet as
ſaynt Auſten ſayth in y• ſame boke / it
is as gret ſynne in y• man as in y• wyf
& ſomdel more. But forſoth ſayth he
it is not y• truth of god but y• ſhrewedne
s;ſe
of man yt maketh man leſſe gylty
than woman in yt ſame ſynne Men
be not ſo oft take in auoutrye ne punyſſhed
for auoutry as wymen be / for
they be leſſe gylty / but for yt they be more
gylty & more myghty to maynten
ther ſynne / & nygh eche of them conforted
other in his ſynne. Men be wytne
s;ſes
Iuges & doers to punyſſhe auoutrye
in woman / & for they be ouerdone
gylty in auoutrye / therfore they
trauayle nyghe all with one aſſent to

                     •
                  ten theyr lecherye. In woman
is ſelden ſeen auoutrye. And therfore

it is full ſclaunderous whan it
falleth and harde punyſſhed. But in
men it is ſoo comon that ther is vnnethes
ony ſclaundre therof / wymen
dare not ſpeke ayenſt the lecherye of
men / and men wyll not ſpeke to repreue
the lecherye of man / for they be
ſo moche gylty. Synne that ſeldome
falleth is mooſt ſclaunderous / and
yet in caſe leſſe greuous. And ſynne
that often falleth and is mooſt in vſe
is leſſe ſclaunderous & yet it is mooſt
greuous. For the more cuſtomable
and the more bolder that men be in
ſynne / and the leſſe drede and ſhame
that men haue to ther ſynne / the more
greuous is ther ſynne. Therfore
ſaynt Auſten in the ſame place ſpeketh
more of this mater ayenſt the lecherye
of men and ſayth thus. Peraduenture
thy wyf hereth in the chirche
by prechynge that it is not leful to the
to take ony other but thy wyfe. She
cometh home and grutcheth ayenſt
thy lecherye & ſayth to the that thou
dooſt thynges that is not lefull / for
why we be both cryſten. The chaſtyre
that thou axeſte of me yelde thou
to me. Iowe to the fayth / and thou
oweſt fayth to me / and both we owe
fayth to cryſte. Though thou deſceyue
me thou deſceyueſt not god whoos
ſeruauntes we be both. Thou deſceyue
s;te
not hym that bought vs bothe / for
he knoweth all. But weneſt thou
ſayth ſaynt Auſten that the man wyl
be heled and amende hym with hyr
wordes. Nay nay ſayth he / but anone
he ſhall be wroth and he ſhall be wode
both with his wyfe and with the
prechoure and curſe the tyme that his
wyfe came to the chirche for to here
the trouthe. Theſe be the wordes of
ſaynt Auſten in the ſame boke. And
yet after in the ſame booke he ſayth
thus. Peraduenture thou lechour wylt
excuſe the and ſaye. I take none other
mannes wyfe / but I take myn owne
ſeruaunt. Wylt thou ſayth he that thy
wyfe ſaye to the. I take none other
huſbonde. I take but my ſeruaunt.
God forbede that thy wyf ſholde ſay
ſoo to the. Better it is that ſhe haue
ſorowe of thy ſynne / than folowe the
or take wycked exſample of the. Thy
wyfe is chaſte & an holy woman and
a true cryſten woman. She hath ſorowe
of thy lecherye / not for the fleſſhe
but for charyte. And thy wyf wolde
that thou dooſt not amys / not for
that ſhe dooth not amys / but for it is
not ſpedefull to the. For yf ſhe kepte
hyr chaſte & dyd not lecherye only for
that yu ſholdeſt do no lecherye / yf thou
dooſt lecherye / ſhe ſholde do lecherye.
But for yt the good woman kepeth
chaſtyte / not onely for the fayth yt ſhe
ought to the / but alſo for the fayth
that ſhe ought to cryſte. For though
the man do amys / yet the woman gyueth
hyr chaſte to god Therfor ſayth
ſaynt Auſten in the ſame place. Cryſte
ſpeketh in the hertes of good wymen
within in theyr ſoule there ther
huſbonde hereth it not / for he is not
worthy to here it and conforteth his
doughter with ſuche maner wordes.
Thou art euyll dyſeaſed with wronges
of thy huſbonde / what hath he do
to the. I praye y• haue pacyence be ſory

of his myſdede / but folowe hym not
to do amys / but he muſt folowe the in
goodneſſe. For in that that he dooth
amys lete hym not be thy hede to lede
the / but lete thy god be thyn hede.
For yf thou folowe hym as an hede
in his ſhrewedneſſe / both hede & body
ſhall fall downe in to helle. And therfore
myght not the bodye yt is the wyf
folowe the wycked hede / but myght
ſhe holde hyr to the hede of holy chirche
that is cryſte. To hym the wyfe
ought hyr chaſte / to hym pryncypaly
ſhe muſte do worſhyp / for he is pryncypal
huſbonde. Be hyr huſbonde preſent
be he abſent / the good woman
ſhall alwaye kepe hyr chaſte. For cryſte
hyr huſbōde to whom pryncypaly
ſhe ought hyr chaſte is neuer abſent.
Chaūge your lyfe ye letcherous men
ſayth ſaynt Auſten there / & fro thens
forwarde be ye chaſte / ne ſaye ye not
that ye may not kepe you chaſte. For
it is a ſhame to ſaye that man maye
not do that a woman dooth / ne be ſo
chaſte as a womas is. The woman
by ryght hath as freell a fleſſhe as y•
man. And woman was fyrſte deſceyued
of the adder / your chaſte wyues
ſhewe to you that ye may be chaſte yf
ye wyl. Theſe be the wordes of ſaynt
Auſten.

               DIues. Wymen may better be
chaſte than men / for they haue
moche kepynge vpon theȳ
The lawe byddeth them to chaſtyte.
Theyr huſbondes be beſye to kepe
theym / and harde lawes be ordeyned
to punyſſhe theym yf they de amys.
¶Pauper. To this anſwereth ſaynt
Auſten in the ſame booke and ſayth
thus. Moche kepynge maketh woman
chaſte / and manhode ſholde make
man chaſte. To woman is ordeyned
moche kepynge / for ſhe is more
freell / woman is aſhamed for hyr
huſbonde to do amys. But thou art
not aſhamed for cryſte to doo amys.
Thou art more free than the woman
/ for thou art ſtrenger and lyghtelyer
/ thou myghteſt ouercome the
fleſſhe and the fende yf thou wylt.
Therfore god hath bytaken the to
thyſelfe. But a woman hath moche
kepynge of hyr huſbonde / dredefull
lawe / good norture / grete ſhame / faſtneſſe
/ and god pryncypall / and thou
man haſte only god aboue the. Thy
wyfe fleeth lecherye for drede and for
ſhame of the / for drede of the lawe / for
good norture / and pryncypaly for
god. But for all theſe thou kepeſte
not thyſelfe chaſte / neyther thou leueſte
not thy lecherye neyther for drede
of god ne for goddes lawe ne for ſhame
of the worlde / ne for ſhame of thy
wyfe to whom thou art bounde to be
true / ne thou wylt leue it for no good
norture / but lyue as an harlotte and
vſe harlottes maners. Thou art not
aſhamed of thy ſynnes ſayth ſaynt
Auſten / for ſo many men falle there
in. The ſhrewedneſſe of man is now
ſoo greate that men be more aſhamed
of chaſtyte than of lecherye.
Manquellers / theues / periurers / falſe
wytneſſe / rauenours / and falſe men
be abhomynable and hated amonges

the people. But who ſoo wyll lye by
his woman & be a bolde lechoure / he
that is loued is prayſed. And all the

And yf ony man be ſo herdy to
ſaye that he is chaſte and true to his
wyfe. And yf it be knowe that he be
ſuche he is aſhamed to come amonges
men that be not lyke hym in maner
For they ſholde Iape & ſcorne hȳ
& ſaye that he is no man. For mānes
ſhrewednes is now ſo grete / that ther
is no man holde a man but he be ouercome
with lecherye. And he that
ouercometh lecherye and kepeth hym
chaſte he is holde no man. Theſe be
the wordes of ſaynt Auſten in a boke
de decem cordis. ¶Diues. Me
meruayleth moche that ſaynt Auſten
and you alſo accuſe man ſoo moche
of lecherye / and put more defaute in
man than in woman. ¶Pauper.
Cryſte dyde the ſame. We rede in the
goſpell. Io.viij. that on a tyme whan
cryſte ſatte in the temple of Ieruſalem
techynge the people his lawes.
Than the ſcrybes & the men of lawe
and the phareſeys brought a woman
newely taken in auoutrye / & ſette hyr
byfore cryſte and ſayd to hym all in
gyle. Mayſter / this woman ryght
now was take in auoutrye. The lawe
of Moyſes byddeth vs ſtone all
ſuche / but what ſayeſt thou there to.
All this they ſayde in gyle / for hadde
he bode them ſtone hyr / he hadde
ſayd ayenſt his owne prechynge. For
his prechynge and techynge was full
of mercy and pyte. And yf he hadde
ſayd that ſhe ſholde not haue be ſtoned
/ than hadde he ſayd ayenſt Moyſes
lawe and than wolde they haue
ſtoned hym. And therfore he ſayd
ne that one ne that other. But he
ſtouped downe and wrote with his
fynger in the erthe. And whan he
hadde wryten a whyle / he ſette hym
vpryght ayen & ſayd to them. Whiche
of you be without ſynne / he caſte on
hyr the fyrſte ſtone. And afterwarde
he ſtouped downe and wrote in the
erthe. And whan the accuſers of the
woman herde theſe wordes of cryſte
and ſee his wrytynge / they were aſhamed
and went out eche after other / and
the eldeſte wente out fyrſte / and
none of them lefte there. For as ſaye
theſe clerkes / eche of theym ſawe in
that wrytynge all the euyll ſynnes
that he had done of lecherye of ſpouſebreche
or of ony other ſynne. And
eche of them wende that all other about
had ſeen his ſynne. And ſo for
drede & for ſhame they went out / for
they ſawe well that they were more
gylty in lecherye than the woman &
more worthy to be ſtoned. But cryſte
of his goodneſſe wrought ſoo / that
eche of theym ſawe there his owne
ſynne and none other mannes / ſo gyuynge

And whan they were gone out
for drede and ſhame. Than ſayd cryſte

to dye / yet hyr accuſers & the people
that brought hyr thyder were not
worthy to dampne hyr / ne to purſue
hyr to deth / for they were more gylty

/ yet the lawe wyll not that they

them not ſo moche to generacōn
But they be free to cōtynence & kepe

deyned yt man & woman ſholde not

togydre. For by auctoryte & fornycacyon
falleth full ofte that the brother
lyeth by his ſyſter and the fader by his

doughter. And many vnlawfull wedloke
is made bycauſe of auoutre. And
he that dooth auoutrye he is a theef / and
robbe the man or woman of his

catell. For the wyues bodye is the
huſbondes bodye / and his body is hyr

that dooth fornycacōn he robbeth cryſte

And therfore he that breketh it is an

ſayth that the woman whiche forſaketh

dooth many ſynnes. Fyrſte
ſhe is myſbyleuynge to goddes lawe / &

But hyr ſones ſhall gyue no rotes / &

She ſhall leue ther mynde in curſynge

deceyued Adam Sampſon Peter Dauyd
& Salomon / who may than be

Many a man hath be deſceyued by
wycked wymen / more by his owne foly
than by dyſceyte of wymen. But
many more wymen haue be deceyued
by malyce of men than euer were men
deceyued by malyce of wymen. And
therfore the woman lechour is called
the ſnare of the fende yt hunteth after
mānes ſoule. For the wyſe man ſayth
Inueni amariorē morte mulierē &
                     •
                  .
I haue foūde woman more bytterer
than deth. Suche is the ſnare of the
hunter / hyr herte is a net & hyr handes
be harde bondes. He yt pleſeth god
ſhall aſcape hyr / but the ſynful man
ſhall be take of hyr. Eccl .vij. But
men be called not only y• ſnare of the
fende but alſo they be called his net
ſprede abrode on the hylle of Tabor
for to take many at ones. Ozee .v.

Mannes malyce is called a net ſpred
a brode on an hyghe hylle for it is open
& bodely done / not in a fewe but
in many. And therfor whan holy wryte
ſpeketh of y• malyce of men / he ſpeketh
in the plurell nombre as to many.
But whan he repreueth the malyce
of woman he ſpeketh in the ſynguler
nombre as to fewe / in token yt ther
be more ſhrewes of men than of wymen
/ & comonly more malyce in men
than in wymen / all though ſome woman
be malycyous. Fyghtynge / robbery
/ manſlaughter / open lechery / glotony
/ gyle / falſeneſſe / periurye / traytoury
/ falſe contryuynge / and ſuche other
horryble ſynnes reygne more in man
than in woman. This falſe excuſacy
on yt excuſe ſo ther ſynne by the malyce
of wymen / began fyrſte in Adam
and loſte Adam & all mankynde / for
ſynfully he excuſed his ſynne by woman
whan god vndernam hym of
his ſynne & put woman in defaute.
Alſo he putte god in defaute yt made
woman & anſwered full proudely / as
men do now a dayes & ſayd to god.
The woman that yu gaue to me to be
my felowe yaue me of the tree & I ete
therof. As who ſayth. Haddeſt thou
not gyuen hyr to be my felowe I ſholde
not haue ſynned. And ſo notwithſtandynge
yt he was more in defaute
than y• woman / yet he wolde not knowelege
ony defaute / but he put woman
& god pryncypally yt made woman
in defaute. ¶Diues. How was
Adam more in defaute than woman
¶Pauꝑ. For to hym pryncypaly god
gaue the cōmaundement yt he ſholde
not ete of that tree / & Eue knewe it
not but by Adam. Woman was tempted
by the fende wonderfully in the
adder whiche went yt tyme ryght vp / and
hadde a face lyke a woman. As
Beda ſayth & the mayſter of ſtoryes
And ſhe was dyſceyued with his fayre
byheſtes and his falſe ſlye ſpeche.
For he behyght hyr that they ſholde
not dye but be as goddes knowynge
good and euyll. Adam had no temptacyon
from outwarde but a ſymple
worde of his wyfe that profered him
the apple. For we fynde not that ſhe
ſayd to hym ony deſceyuable worde.
And therfore ſythen man was forboden
of goddes mouthe / and ſhe not
but by man / and man had leſſe temptacyon
than woman / and therto in
no thynge wolde accuſe hymſelfe / ne
yelde hym gylty / but put defaute all
in woman & in god / therfore he ſynned
more than woman / for woman
yelde hyr gylty / but ſhe axed no mercy.
She made no ſuche excuſacōn / but
in a grete parte yelded hyr gylty / in
that ſhe ſayd / the adder hath deſceyued
me. For in yt ſhe knowleged that
ſhe was deſceyued / ſhe knowleged yt
ſhe hadde do amys & vnwyſely / and
otherwyſe than ſhe ought to haue do
And for that woman lowed hyr and
knowleged hyr vnwyſedom & hyr foly
/ therfore god put in woman that
tyme an hope of our ſaluacōn whan
he ſayd to the adder I ſhall put enmyte
bytwene the & woman / and bytwene
thy ſede & hyr ſede / and ſhe ſhall
breke thyn hede / that was the fende
whiche was hede & leder of the adder

that tyme. The ſede of the fende be
wycked werkes and wycked folke / to
whome god ſayd in the goſpell. Vos
ex patre dyabolo eſtis. Io .viij. Ye be
of the fader the fende. The ſede of
the woman gooſtly be hyr good dedes
/ with whiche the fende and the
fendes lymes haue grete enuye. And
comonly wymen haue more horrybylyte
of ſynne than men doo. And by
our lady bleſſyd mote ſhe be the fendes
powrr is deſtroyed. Alſo the ſede
of woman is cryſte born of the mayde
Mary without parte of man. And
ſo there was neuer man proprely ſede
of woman but cryſte allone / and
alwaye is enmyte bytwene cryſte and
the fende and his ſede. For as ſaynt
Poule ſayth. Cryſte & Belyall / lyght
and derkeneſſe may not accorde. For
this reaſon ſaynt Poule ſayth / that
Adam was not deſceyued in the fyrſt
pryuarycacōn / but woman was deſceyued
.i. ad. Thi .ij. And therfore as the
gloſe ſayth. Whan god Adam vndernam
/ he ſayd not yt the woman had
deſceyued me / as y• woman ſayd / the
adder hath deſceyued me / but he ſayd
the woman gaue me of the tree & I
haue eten. And alſo as y• gloſe ſayth
there. Adam was ſo wyſe yt he myght
not byleue the fendes tales ne be deſceyued
in yt maner as y• woman was
And for the woman was not ſo wyſe
as Adam was therfore ſhe byleued y•
fendes tales & ſo was deſceyued. And
the wyſer yt Adam was the more was
his ſynne whan he felle. But though
Adam was not deceyued fro outwarde
by an other / he was deſceyued fro
inwarde by hymſelfe by preuy pryde
as ſayth ſaynt Auſten de ci.li.xiiij.c

began fyrſt to be wycked inwarde / by
whiche preuy wyckednes they felle in

there. Pryde is begynnynge of euery
ſynne. Iniciū omnis peccati ſuꝑbia.
Eccl .x. And as Salomon ſayth. Contricione
precedit ſuꝑbia. et ante ruinā
exaltatur ſpūs. Prouer .xvi. Byfore
brekynge & bryſure gooth pryde / and
byfore open fallynge the ſpryte of a
man and a woman is enhaunſed by
pryde. And therfore ſayth ſaynt Auſten
in the ſame chaptre yt both Adam
and Eue were wycked & deſceyued by
pryde / and well lete of themſelfe byfore
they ete of the tree. For preuy fallynge
inwarde went byfore open fallynge
outwarde by inobedyence / and
ſo Adam was deſceyued and felle by
pryde or Eue gaaf hym the apple / &
Eue was deſceyued by pryde or the
ſerpent deſceyued hyr. For as ſayth

more excellence & hygher degre than
god ordeyned them to. They bothe
ſynned greuouſly / but Adam more
greuouſly as I ſayd fyrſt. And therfor
ſaynt Poule ſayth / not all men dyed
thrugh y• ſynne of Eue but thrugh y•
ſynne of Adam. Ne god ſayd not to
Adam / curſed be y• erthe in Eues ſynne
/ ne he ſayd curſed be y• erth in your
ſynne. But to Adam allone he ſayd / Curſed
be the erthe in thy werke and
in thy ſynne. And therfor ſayth ſaynt
Ambroſe ſuꝑ lucā That Eue ſynned
more by freelte and vnſtabylyte and

chaungeabylyte than by ſhrewednes
Mobilitate magis animi

as mankynde was loſte by man / ſoo
mankynde ſholde be ſaued by man.
And therfore in manhede he wolde
dye for mankynde / for manhede had
loſte mankynde. And alſo he becam
man and not woman to ſaue the ordre
of kynde. And for yt womans ſynne
was leſſe greuous than Adams
ſynne / & leſſe dered mankynde / & woman
was leſſe infecte in the fyrſte pryuaricaco

than was man / therfor god
toke his manhede only of woman wt
out parte of man. And ſo in yt he bycam

but in yt he toke his manhede only of
woman without part of man / he dyd

of y• harde ſekenes of Adams ſynne.

woman deſceyued Sampſon yt was
ſoo ſtronge. ¶Pauper. Woman deſceyued
him not tyll he had deſceyued
hymſelfe by lecherye & myſgouernaū
                  ce
of hymſelfe. Fyrſte he wedded an
hethen woman ayenſt goddes lawe
and ayenſt the wyll of his fader and
moder for luſte and myſloue that he
hadde to hyr. After that he laye by a
comon woman yt was hethen. And
after that he toke an other hethen woman
to his concubyne yt hyght Dali
da ye whiche full deſceyued hym and
brought hym to his deth. He was falſe
to god / & wymen were falſe to him
wymen ſaye that he was byſotted vp
on them / & therfore they treated hym
as a ſot. He deſceyued hymſelfe and
dyde full vnwyſely whan he ſuffred
a woman to bynde him amonges his
ennemyes & tolde an hethen woman
his couſeyll / & in what thynge his ennemyes
myght mooſt dere hym. And
all though god tourned his folys dedes
to y• worſhyp of god & of goddes
lawe / yet Sampſon was not excuſed
therby / for he dyde moche amys & moche
foly. Alſo Dauyd was deſceyued
by his mys luſte & his lecherye / not
by the woman Berſabee as yu ſaydeſt
in thy verſe. For thus we rede in holy
wryt in the ſeconde boke of kynges
xi. ca
                     •
                  . That on a tyme whan kynge
Dauyd roſe from his ſlepe after myd
daye & romed in his ſoler of his paleyſe
/ he ſawe a fayre woman waſſhe
hyr in hyr ſoler / he knewe not the woman
/ ne the woman thought not on
hym ne knewe not of his wycked wyl
as the boke ſhewed there. Anone he
ſent after this woman / & whan ſhe
cam to hym he laye by hyr & bygate
hyr with childe. And anon as he knewe
that ſhe was with childe / to hyde
his ſynne / he ſent after hyr huſbonde
Vrye yt he ſholde come home & medle
with his wyf yt the childe ſholde be named
to hym & not to Dauyd. And for

the good knyght wolde not come home
at his wyfe ne vſe luſte of his bodye
whyles goddes ooſt lay in y• felde
in ſyege of a cyte that hyght Rabath
Dauyd ſent hym ayen with lettres of
his deth to Ioab the prynce of y• ooſt
& traytourly dyd him ſlee. Here mygh
teſte y• ſee that Dauyd was ouercome
with lecherye & deſceyued by the
fende or the woman came to hym.
For as cryſte ſayth in the goſpell / for
who ſoo loketh on a woman in wyll
to do amys with hyr / anone he hath
do lecherye and forfetteth ayenſt this
cōmaūdement. Non mechaberis. Dauyd
loked on that woman in wyll to
do lecherye whan y• woman thought
none enyll. He ſent after hyr as after
his lege woman & ſhe wyſte not why
And whan ſhe cam to hym as to hyr
kynge / he lay by hyr ſynfully / for it
was full harde to hyr to lette hym.
Alſo Peter forſoke cryſte in tyme of
his paſſyon & ranne awaye fro cryſte
or ony woman ſpake to hym yt tyme
& ſo he deſceyued hymſelfe / & the woman
deſceyued hym not / ſhe dyd hyr
offyce / for ſhe was vſſhere and keper
at the dore / as the gloſe ſayth & ſaynt
Gregorye / and ſhe ſayd to hym that
he was one of cryſtus dyſcyples as
ſhe ſayd ſoth. For ſhe was bounde yt
ſhe ſholde lete none of cryſtus dyſcyples
entre. And anone at y• fyrſt worde
he forſoke cryſte & ſayd yt he knewe
hym not. And not only woman
dyd ſaynt Peter forſake cryſte in this
maner / but men ſayd to hym y• ſame
wordes / & for drede he forſoke cryſte
ſoone after & ſwore yt he knewe hym
not. And therfor yf it be repreue to woman
yt woman made ſaynt Peter for
ſake cryſte / as moche repreue it is to
men moche more. For all though he
forſoke cryſte at y• womans worde / yet
he ſwore not therfor ne forſwore him
tyll men ſayd to hym the ſame wordes.
Math xxvi. et Mar .xiiij. Alſo Salomon

ſought not him. He wyſt wel yt it was
ayenſt goddes lawe a kynge to haue

ſholde not haue many wyues / ne

it was forboden to hym and to all other
ſo to companye with hethen wymen
And ayenſt all this dyde Salomon
in hyghe offence of god. Salomon
ſought the companye of hethen
wymen. The wymen were ſtable in
theyr falſe byleue. He was vnſtable
in his ryght byleue and folowed hyr
falſe byleue / and forſoke goddes lawe
in a grete parte / and worſhypped
falſe goddes. Lecherye ouercam hym
longe or many of the wymen knewe
hym. And ſoo be men ryght now a
dayes ouercomen with lecherye with
out womannes companye and without
doynge of wymen. For as cryſte
ſayth in the goſpell. Who ſoo loketh
on a woman in wyl to do amys with

hyr / though ſhe thynketh not on hym
he dooth lecherye. And yf he handle
hyr or ſmell hyr or ſpeke to hyr or go
to hyr or ſeke by wyſes / or by ſleyghtes
to haue his luſte of hyr / thoughe
the woman conſent not to hym / and
thoughe he be letteth of his wycked

dooth ayenſt this cōmaundement of

theym. They caſte many wyles to gete
womans aſſent in ſynne. Men comonly
be werkers and begynners of
lecherye / and than whether the woman
aſſent or not aſſent / yet the man
is gylty. And for oftentyme it falleth
that whan men wende to be ſeker of
the womans aſſent / than the woman
wyll not aſſent for drede of god / and
yf ſhe aſſented byfore and hyght the
man to folowe his luſte and after repenteth
hyr & withdraweth hyr from
his wycked companye / than ſhall the
lecherous man dyffame all wymen / and
ſaye that they be falſe and deſceyuable.
For ſuche lechours ſpeken
mooſt vylonye of wymen / for yt they
may not haue ther foule luſt of them
at wyll / and for they may not defoule
them with ther bodyes / they defoule
them with ther tonges / and ſpeke of
them full euyll & defame them falſely
/ and procure to them the harme
that they may. Example we haue in
the boke of Danyell .xiij. ca. Of the
good woman Suſanne and two falſe
olde preſtes that were Iuges & gouernours
of the people for that yere / whiche
by one aſſent wayted to haue
this woman allone in hyr gardeyne / whan
ſhe ſholde go to waſſhe hyr as
the maner was that tyme. And for
ſhe wolde not aſſent to ther wyckedneſſe
but cryed after helpe / anon they
cryed ayenſt hyr. And whan men come
/ they ſayd that they founde hyr
lyenge with a yonge man / and ſo falſely
dampned hyr to deth / for that
they myght not doo theyr foule luſte
with hyr. But at the prayer of Suſanne
god ſent Danyell his prophete
& toke them & conuecte them in theyr
falſehode and ſlough theym & ſaued
Suſanne. We fynde alſo in the ſeconde
boke of kynges the .xiij. ca. That
Aamon the ſone of Dauyd fayned
hym ſeke and prayed his fader Dauyd
that Thamer his ſyſter myght
come & kepe hym. And whan ſhe was
come he ſpake to hyr for to lye by hyr
but ſhe wolde not aſſent. And than he
oppreſſed hyr / & ſo defouled his owne
ſyſter. And anone he hated hyr more
than euer he loued hyr byfore bycauſe
that ſhe wolde not aſſent to hym / and
ſpytefully put hyr out of his chambre
and dyde ſhette the dore after hyr
For this dede Aamon was ſlayn ſoone
after of his brother Abſolon.

               DIues. And yet many a woman
wyll aſſent to luſte of
fleſſhe full lyghtely yf it be
proufred. ¶Pauper. That is ſoth.
But wymen be not ſo redy to aſſent
as men be to proufre it. And he that

profereth it & begynneth he aſſenteth
fyrſte & is more in defaute. ¶Diues
Thou excuſeſt mooſt wymen / & accuſeſte
men. ¶Pauper. I accuſe no
good man / but lecherous men / ne I
excuſe no wycked woman / but good
wymen that be falſely defamed of le
cherye / not only in ther perſones / but
in ther kynde generally. For the proude
malyce of man defameth vnreſonably
the kynde of woman. And as
Adam dyd put his ſynne on woman
& wolde not excuſe his owne malyce
to get mercy. ¶Diues. Salomon ſpeketh
moche euyll of wymen. ¶Pauper.
And Salomon ſpeketh moche
good of wymen. For he ſayd. Mulier
timens dn̄i. ipſa laudabit
                     •
                  . The woman
y• dredeth god ſhe ſhall be prayſed.
Salomon repreueth wycked wyman
& prayſeth good wymen / and he
repreueth wycked men and prayſeth
good men. ¶Diues. Salomon ſayth
Omnis malicia nequicia mulieris.
Breuis eſt omnis malicia ſuper maliciam
mulieris. Eccl .xxv. The wyckedneſſe
of woman is all malyce / and
euery malyce is ſhorte aboue the malyce
of woman. ¶Pauper. Soth it
is whan wymen gyue theym to ſhrewedneſſe
than they be full malycyouſe.
And whan they gyue theym to
goodneſſe they be full good. And therfore
the wyſe man in y• next chaptre
folowynge prayſeth wymen full moche
& ſayth / that bleſſyd is that man
that hath a good woman to his wyf
His yeres ſhal be doubled / he ſhal ende
his yeres in peas. A good woman
is a good parte / and a good parte of
theym that drede god / & ſhe ſhall be
gyuen to a man for his good dedes.
The grace of the beſy woman ſhall
lyke hyr huſbonde & make his bones
fatte. Hyr dyſcyplyne and hyr norture
is the gytte of god. And the holy
woman & chaſte is grace vpon grace
And as the ſonne ſhynyng lyghtneth
the worlde in the heyght of the daye / ſo
the beaute of a good woman is in
confort & aray of hyr huſbonde. And
as golden pyleris ſet on ſyluer baſys / ſo
be ſyker fete on the ſoles of the ſtable
woman. And endeles groūdes on
a ſeker ſtone be goddes cōmaundement
in the herte of an holy woman
Fundamenta eterna ſuꝑ petrā ſolidāmandata

vnwyſely vſe the wyne / and vnwyſely
vſeth the woman & other goddes creatures
Thoughe thou drynke wyne
tyll thou art dronken and falleſte in

though thou loke on a woman & art
caught in hyr beaute / & aſſenteſt to do

thou ſholdeſt prayſe god / thou thynkeſt

               DIues. Womans araye ſtyreth
noche folke to doo lecherye.
¶Pauꝑ. All though in caſe
the araye & the atyre is not to blame
nomore than is hyr beaute. Yet by comon
courſe of kynde both man & woman
ſeke to be honeſtly arayed after
ther aſtate & after ther degre / & after
the cuſtome of the contre yt they dwell
in / not to tempte folke to lecherye / ne
for pryde / ne for none other ſynne / but
for honeſte of mankynde & to y• worſhyp
of god / to whos lykeneſſe man
& woman is made. And he is our brother
/ & this is the cuſtome of good folke
But yf they doo it for pryde / or to
tempte folke to lecherye or for ony other
ſynne / or yt they toke on them atyre
yt is not accordynge to them yf it be
to coſtfull or to ſtraūge in ſhap / or to

ſynne ful greuouſly in the ſyght
of god. And namely tho men yt cloth
them ſoo ſhorte / that man & woman
may ſee the forme of the ſhap of ther
preuy membres whiche be ſhamefull
to ſhewe / & the ſyght is grete cauſe of
temptacyon & of wycked thoughtes.
Saynt Poule bydeth yt wymen ſholde

ſayth ſaynt Peter in his fyrſte pyſtle.
iij. ca. Where he byddeth y• men ſholde
haue ther wyues in worſhyp & kepe
them honoſtly. ¶Diues. Wymen
now a dayes araye theym full moche
ayenſt the techynge of Peter & Poule
& therfore I drede me that they ſynne
full greuouſly. ¶Pauper. Peter &
Poule forbyde not vtterly ſuche aray
But they forbyde wymen ſuche aray
to vſe in pryde / or to prouoke folke to
ſecherye and to vſe ſuche araye paſſynge
ther aſtate / or for an euyll ende
For we fynde that ſaynt Cecyle and
many other holy wymen went arayed
in clothes of golde & in ryche perrye,
& wered the hayre vnder y• ſolemp
ne atyre. And Peter and Poule ſayd
tho wordes pryncypally for tyme of
prayers / as for lente / ymbre dayes / gangedayes / frydayes / vigylyes / and
in tyme of generall proceſſyon made
for nede. In ſuche tyme namely man
& woman ſholde leue all tokens and
ſygnes of pryde in araye. For as the
gloſe ſayth. Ther proude clothynge
gette the no good of god and maketh
folke to deme amys / namely yf it paſſe
meſure & good maner. The pryncypall
entencyon of ſaynt Poule there
he ſayth tho wordes / is to enfourme
men and wymen in prayers. For

whome they ſholde praye why & how
and where they ſhall praye as ſayth
the gloſe. And he enformeth them to
praye in lowneſſe / without pompe of
clothynge & of grete araye. For I am
ſyker / that the foule ſtynkynge pompe
& pryde of araye that is now vſed
in this londe in all thre partyes of the
chirche. That is to laye / in the feudorys
/ and in clergye / and in comoners
wyll not be vnuenged. But yf it be
ſoone amended by very repentaunce
and forſakynge of this ſynne. For
fro the hygheſte vnto the loweſt in euery
aſtate and in euery degree / and
nyghe honde in euery perſone is now
araye paſſynge to mannes bodye and
womans ayenſt all reaſon and the
lawe of god. ¶Diues. Sythen it is
ſo that man is more pryncypall in ordre
of kynde than is woman / & more
ſtable and myghty and of hygher
dyſcrecyon by cours of kynde than is
woman / and ſholde as thou haſt well
ſayd be more vertuous and ſtable in
goodneſſe than woman / how maye it
be that wymen kepe them ofte more
chaſte & be more ſtable in goodneſſe
than man. For we ſee that whan men
take them to be ankeres and recluſes
within a fewe yeres comonly eyther
they falle in reuerſes / or hereſyes / or
they breke out for womans loue / or
for trouble of ther lyfe / or by ſome gyle
of y• fende. But of wymen ancres
ſo incluſed is ſeldon herde ony of theſe
defaut / but holyly they begynne &
holyly they ende. ¶Pauper. Men by
waye of kynde is more ſtable than is
wymen and of more dyſcrecyon / but
by grace wymen be oft more ſtable in
goodneſſe than be men & haue better
dyſcrecōn in goodnes than many
a man. ¶Diues. Why ſo. ¶Pauper
For men truſte to moche in themſelf
& truſte not in god as they ought to
do / wymen knowyng ther freeite truſte
not in themſelfe / but only in god
and cōmende them more to god than
do men oftyme. And the wyſe man
ſayth. Inicium ſapiencie timor dn̄i.
Prouer .ix. ca. pſal. no. The drede of
the lorde is begynnynge of wyſedom
For who ſoo dredeth god with loue
drede as y• good childe the fader / that
loue drede ſhall teche hym what is
pleſaunt to god / and what may diſpleaſe
hym. And it ſhall make hym
beſy to do his pleſaunce & to leue his
offence. And comonly whan men become
ancres they doo it moro for the
worlde than for god. They doo it for
ypocreſye to haue a name of holynes
and of wyſdom / or for couetyſe to get
good or to be out of obedyence / and at
ther owne wyll / to ete & to drynke / wake
and ſlepe whan them lyketh / and
to do as theym lyketh. For ther ſhall
no man repreue theym therof / ne wyte
whether they doo well or euyll / or
whether they praye or they praye not
And comonly men ancres haue more
dalyaunce with the worlde bothe
with men and wymen than euer they
had or they were ancres. And though
they were lewde fooles byfore / than
men holde theym wyſe / and axe of
them doubtes of conſcyence and of
thynges that be to come / of the whiche
thynges they can noo ſkyll. And

yet what they ſaye / the people taketh
it for a goſpell / and ſo they deſceyue
many a man and many a woman.
And ſythen they groūde theym all in
pryde / in ypocreſye / and in couetyſe / &
truſte in themſelfe more than in god
therfore he ſuffreth the tende to haue
power ouer theym / and ſo dyſeaſed
theym and bryngeth theym to a wycked
ende. But wymen take oft y• ſtate
for no ſuche ende / but only for god
And they ſeynge ther owne freelte cō
                  mende
theym to god. And therfore
god kepeth them ſoo / that the fende
may not dyſeaſe theym in ſuche maner
ne dyſceyue theym. We rede in holy
wryt Gen̄ .xij. et .xx. That whan
Abraham cam in to ſtraūge londes / he
bad his wyfe Saray that ſhe ſholde
not be aknowen that ſhe was his
wyfe / but ſaye that ſhe was his ſyſter
For ſhe was ſoo fayre a woman that
he wyſte well that men ſholde coueyte
hyr for hyr beaute. And yf they
wende that ſhe were his wyfe / they
ſholde ſlee hym to haue hyr at theyr
wyll / for auoutrye was harder punyſſhed
than manſlaughter. And therfore
to ſaue his lyfe Abraham ſayd &
bad hyr ſaye that ſhe was his ſyſter.
For as doctor de lyra ſayth. Abraham
wyſte well that ſhe was a good woman
/ and hadde ſuche an angell to
kepe hyr that noo man ſholde haue
power to defoule hyr / and ſo it befell.
For anone ſhe was take & led to the
kynge of Egypt & kepte there in the
kynges courte longe tyme. And Abraham
fared well by cauſe of hyr. But
god ſent ſuche a ſekeneſſe to y• kynge
and to his wyues & to his concubynes
and to all his houſholde / that they
hadde no myght ne lykynge to defoule
hyr. Than the kynge axed his preſtes
and mayſters of the lawe why
that dyſeaſe felle vnto hym and to
his houſholde. And they by reuelacyon
of god ſayden that it was for the
pylgrymes wyfe. And than the kynge
lette hym go with worſhyppe. We
rede alſo that Abraham hadde two
ſones. Yſmaell of Agar his ſeruaunt
and Yſaac of Sara his wyfe. Abraham
loued well Yſmaell / for he was
y• elder ſone. On a tyme Sara ſawe
Yſmaell playe with hyr ſone Yſaac
not goodly / ſhe was myſpayde & ſayd
to Abraham that he ſholde put Yſmaell
& his moder Agar out of houſholde
/ for Yſmaell ſayd ſhe ſholde haue
no parte of herytage with hyr ſone
Yſaac. Abraham bare full heuy
of theſe wordes / for he loued moche
Yſmaell. Than god ſayd to Abraham.
Take it not ſoo harde ne ſoo
ſharpely that Sara ſayd to the of
thy childe and of thy ſeruaunt Agar
But in all thynges that Sara ſayth
to the / here hyr voyce and doo there
after. And than Abraham put them
out of his houſholde full moche ayenſt
his herte. And ſoo notwithſtandynge
that Abraham was ſoo nyghe
god that he was called goddes frende
/ yet as than his wyfe knewe more
of goddes wyll than he dyde. Alſo
we rede of Yſaac and Rebecca his
wyfe that they hadde two ſones borne
at ones whiche were Eſau and Iacob
Yſaac loued better Eſau than

Iacob. But Rebecca loued better Iacob
than Eſau / & ſo dyd god. And by
techyng of the holy gooſt ſhe begyled
Yſaac & Eſau alſo / & dyd Yſaac gyue
his pryncypall bleſſynge to Iacob / there
he wolde haue gyuen it to Eſau
and all was goddes dede and ſo confermed
by god / that whan Yſaac wyſt
of that gyle / yet he durſte not withdrawe
his bleſſynge / for he ſawe wel
that it was goddes wyll and goddes
doynge. And therfor he ſayd to Eſau
wepynge for he was ſo begyled. Benedixi
ei. et erit benedictus. I haue
bleſſyd hym / & he ſhall be bleſſyd.

               DIues. I aſſent well that by
grace a woman maye be as
ſtable in chaſtyte & in goodneſſe
as man. And without grace
neyther man ne woman maye kepe
hym chaſte. For the fleſſhe bothe of
man and woman is full freell and
full redye to falle. And therfore I
praye the teche me ſome remedye ayenſte
the temptacyon of lecherye.
¶Pauper. One remedye is reſonable
/ abſtynence from mete & drynke / and
for to flee deynte metes & deynte
drynkes / and to flee glotonye as
mooſt begynnynge & mene to lechery
And therfore glotony is forboden by
this cōmaūdement as mene & waye
to lecherye. And other remedye is harde
lyenge / watche and trauayll that
the bodye haue not to moche eaſe / but
be well occupyed. For the wyſe man
ſayth. That ydelſhyppe hath taught
moche malyce. Multam enim maliciam
docuit dcioſitas. Therfor ſayth
he. Ryght as to the aſſe longeth fedynge
/ yerde and byrdeyne / ſoo to the
ſeruaunt / that is to ſaye / to the fleſſhe
that ſholde be ſuget and ſeruaunt to
the ſoule / longeth drede and chaſtyſynge
/ and werkes of good occupacyon.
Eccl .xxxiij. And god ſayth that
pryde and plente of brede / and welfare
/ and plente of rycheſſes / and ydelſhyppe
were cauſe of the wyckedneſſe
of the Sodomytes / and of there lecherye
/ and for they loued not poore folke.
Ezechi .xvi. And therfore almeſdede
is a grete remedye ayenſt lecherye / to
gete grace of chaſtyte / ſo that it be
gyuen to the poore nedye that ben in
myſcheef / and to ſuche that haue not
by kynde to gete ther lyuelode by trauayll
of ther bodye / and yf they begge
they doo it without auaryce / with
mekeneſſe and clenneſſe of lyuynge / to
ſuche byddeth cryſte to do almeſſe
ſaynge. Date elimoſinam. et ecce omnia
munda ſunt vobis Luce. Gyue
ye almeſſe / & lo all thynges be clene
to you yf ye wyl amende you. And
an other remedye is a man to haue
mynde of his deth / & thynke how he
ſhall wende henſe with bytter payne
& than all his luſte ſhall tourne in to
woo & ſorowe & thynke that by man
or woman neuer ſo fayre / ſo welfarynge
/ ſo hole / ſo luſty / ſo lykynge to
the eye / ſo myghty / ſo wytty / ſo gret of
lynage / ſo ryche / ſo grete of name or
of lordſhypp. Eyther by man eyther
woman / be he euer ſo pleſaūt he ſhall
dye and tourne to erthe & aſſhes and
wormes mete. And yf he ſmel now neuer

ſo ſwete he ſhall ſtynke than full
ſowre. Therfore the wyſe man ſayth
In omni

Eccl .vij. In all theſe werkes thynke
on thy laſte thynges / & thou ſhalt
not do no ſynne without ende. We rede
yt in Englonde was a kynge that
had a concubyne whoſe name was
Roſe. And for hyr grete beaute he called
hyr Roſe amoūde. Roſa mundi.
That is to ſaye. Roſe of the worlde.
For hym thought yt ſhe paſſed all wymen
in beaute. It befell that ſhe dyed
& was buryed whyle the kynge was
abſent. And whan he cam ayen for
grete loue that he had to hyr / he wolde
ſee the bodye in the graue. And
whan the graue was opened / there ſate
an horryble tode vpon hyr breſte by
twene hyr tetys / & a foule adder bygyrt
hyr bodye about in the mydle / &
ſhe ſtanke ſo yt the kynge ne none other
myght ſtande to ſee that horryble
ſyght. Than the kynge dyd ſhette
ayen the graue / and dyde wryte theſe
two verſes vpon the graue. Hic iacet
in tumba. roſa mundi nō roſa mūda
Non redolet ſed olet quod redolere ſolet
That is thus to ſaye in englyſſhe
Here lyeth in graue roſe of the worlde
/ but not clene roſe. She ſmelleth
not ſwete but ſtytketh full foule / that
ſomtyme ſmelled full ſwete. And an
other remedye ayenſt lecherye is that
a man & woman kepe well ther fyue
wyttes / that a man kepe well his handes
& his bodye from myſtouchynge / his
eeres fro myſherynge that he here
no tales of lecherye / ne foule ſpeche.

an other remedye is a man to kepe
well his herte from ydell thoughtes / and
from wycked thynges. For as

Omni cuſtodia ſerua cor tuū. Prouer.
iiij. With all kepynge kepe well thyn
herte / for of the herte cometh lyfe and
deth. The mayſter of kyndes li.xviij
Sayth that there is a beſt that is called
taxus / that is a brok or a bawſym
in Englyſſhe. And there is a greate
enmyte bytwene the foxe and hym.
The foxe is beſy to put the bawſym
out of his denne. And for he may not
doo it by myght / he doth it by ſleyght
He wayteth tyll whan the bawſym is
gone out of his denne / than he gooth

denne. And for y• bawſym hate

and fyndeth his denne ſo ſtynkynge
& ſo defouled he forſaketh his

By the foxe is vnderſtande the fende
whiche is about nyght and daye to

ſoule is goddes denne / goddes temple

               AN other remedye ayenſt the
temptacōn of lecherye is deuo
cyon & mynde of cryſtus paſſyon.
For as ſaynt Gregorye ſayth.
There is none ſo harde temptacyon / but
that man ſholde ouercome eaſely
ynough yf he thought entyrely on cryſtus
paſſyon. We fynde in geſtys that
on a tyme a grete kynges ſone loued
well a poore woman. For though ſhe
was poore yet ſhe was fayre and pleſaunt
in berynge. The kynges ſone
toke hyr to his paramoure and wedded
hyr. Wherfore his fader and nyghe
all his kynne was myſpayde. For
them thought yt he was moche dyſperached
by hyr / wherfor he ſeynge that
his kynrede bare ſo heuy of his maryage
/ he went in to fer londes & gaf
hym to armes / and what he myght
wynne with his ſwerde he ſent it home
to his wyfe ſauynge his worſhyp
& his lyuynge. In euery Iourney he
had the better of his enmyes / & ſo his
name began to ſprynge fer and wyde
At yt laſt he came in ſo harde a fyght
all though he had the mayſtrye / yet
he was ſoo wounded that nedes he
muſte dye. Than he ſente home his
ſharte full of woundes and of holes
and all forbleded to his wyfe with a
lettre vnder his ſeale ſaynge in this
wyſe. Cerne cicatrices. veteris veſtigia
pugne. Queſiui ꝓprio ſanguine quic
                  
                     •
                  d
habes. Beholde my woundes and

haue theym in thy thought. For all
the goodes that be thyn with my blode
I haue theym bought. And whan
this woman ſawe this ſharte & redde
the letter / ſhe felle downe in ſwowne
And whan ſhe was releued ſhe henge
vp this ſharte in a preuy place of hyr
chambre / & whan euer ony man cam
to hyr to ſpeke of weddyng or of fleſſhely
luſte / ſhe wente in to hyr chambre
and loked on his ſharte / and came
out ayen ſtyffe & ſtedfaſte in hyr huſbondes
loue that was deed & denyed
them ther axynge ſaynge in this maner
Whyle I haue his blood in my
mynde / that was to me ſo good and
kynde. Shall I neuer huſbonde take
/ but hym that dyed for my ſake.
And thus ſhe kepte hyr in clenneſſe
and chaſtyte all hyr lyfe for loue of
hyr huſbonde that dyed for hyr loue.
By this poore woman that was ſoo
fayre is vnderſtande mannes ſoule &
womans whiche is made to the lykeneſſe
of god. But it was made full
poore through the ſynne of Adam.
By the kynges ſone is vnderſtande
cryſte goddes ſone which loued ſo moche
mannes ſoule / that as ſaynt Poule
ſayth / he auentyſſhed hymſelf and
dyſparyched hymſelfe in to the lykeneſſe
of a ſeruaūt / & maryed to hym
our kynde & mannes ſoule and lyued
here two and thrytty wynter & more
in moche woo to wynne the loue of
mannes ſoule and faught ayenſt the
fende / the fleſſhe & the worde that be
alwaye beſye to leſe mannes ſoule.
And alwaye he hadde the mayſtrye
by myght of the godhede. But on go
de frydaye he cam in ſoo fell a fyght
with yt tyraūt the fende of helle that
though he had yt mayſtrye / yet he was
ſo forwoūded yt by waye of manhode
whiche he toke of yt mayde nedely he
muſte dye. And than he ſent home a
letter of loue to his ſpouſe mānes ſoule
ſaynge as yt knyght ſayd. Cerne cicatrices
&
                     •
                  . Beholde my woūdes and
haue them in thy thought / for all the
goodes yt be thyn with my blood I haue
them bought. For why all the Ioye
& blys that we ſholde haue in heuen
and all the grace and goodneſſe that
we haue here in erthe all haue we by
vertue of cryſtus paſſyon. For but he
wolde haue dyed for our ſake els ſholde
we haue layne in helle payne with
out ende. By this ſharte full of woū
                  des
and ſo blodye I vnderſtande his
blyſfull bodye. For as mannes bodye
is clad in his ſharte / ſo yt godhede was
clothed in the blyſfull bodye of cryſte
whiche bodye was all blody & ſo full
of woūdes / yt as ſayth yt ꝓphete Yſa.i.
Fro the ſole of the fote to the toppe of
the hede there was no hole place in
his body. Therfor leue frende I pray
you hange ye this ſharte in a preuy
place of your chambre. That is to
ſaye. Sette ye cryſtus paſſyon entyrely
in your herte. And whan the fende
the worlde or the fleſſhe / or ony wycked
man or woman begynneth for to
tempte you to ſynne / anone wende ye
to your herte and loke ye on this ſharte
Thynke how that blyſfull bodye
was borne of the mayde Mary without
ſynne and ſorowe and neuer dyde
amyſ. Thynke how it was forrent

and for tourne / byſpetted for our
ſynne and our ſake / and not for his
owne gylte. And yf ye do ſo & thynke
entyrely on cryſtus paſſyon / ye ſhall
lyghtely ouercome euery temptacyon
and haue the better pacyence in trybulacyon
Wherfore an holy man ſayth
thus. Reminiſcens ſacrati ſanguinis
quē effudit amator hominis. effunden
do lacrimas. Non eſt locus ingratitudini
.
vbi torrens tante dulcedinis at
tingit animas &
                     •
                  . Whan I thynke
on cryſtus blood that he ſhedde vpon
the rode I lete teres ſmert. What man
may be vnkynde that cryſtus blood
hath in mynde entyrely in his herte.
Swete Iheſu cryſte what is thy gylt
that thou thus for me art ſpylt floure
of vnlothfulnes. I am a theef &
thou dyeſte I am gylty & thou obeyeſt
all my wyckednes. Why gaueſt thou
ſo moche for thyne what wynneſt y•
with thyne harde payne ryche in blyſſe
aboue. Loue thyne herte ſoo depe
hath ſought that payne of deth letteth
me nouht to wynne mannes loue.
An other remedye ayenſt lecherye
is redynge & dalyaūce of holy wryt &
of holy mennes lyues. And therfore
ſaynt Ierom ſayth ad ruſticū monachum.
Ama ſcienciam ſcriptura
                     
                        
                     
                     rum
                   et
carnis vicia nō amabis. Loue connynge
of holy wryt and of goddes lawe / and
thou ſhalt not loue vyces of the
fleſſhe. And therfore god ſayth. Non
videbit me homo et viuet. Exodi.
xxxiij. Ther ſhall no man ſee me by
deuocyon and lyue fleſſhely. For noothynge
ſleeth ſoo moche the luſte of
the fleſſhe as deuocyon / and thynke
on god and to ſtudye goddes lawe.
And an other remedy is to thynke on
helle payne. For as ſayth ſaynt Thomas
de veritate theologie. In helle
ſhall be ouerdone hete of fyre & gnaſtynge
of teeth for colde & for payne / derkeneſſe
& ſmoke & bytter wepynge
without ende. Rorynge and belewynge
of foule fendes / wepynge and
weylynge▪ ſobbynge and ſyghynge of
ſynfull ſoules / and endeles repreue of
ther ſynnes / endles drede / endles thyrſte
/ ſtenche / lyght / thondre
/ & worme of
conſcyence / bondes / pryſon / drede / ſhame
/ wantynge of the blyſfull ſyght
of goddes face / and woo without ony
hope of ony welthe. There men
ſhall ſeke deth & not fynde it / & wyſſhe
that they neuer hadde be borne.
And as ſaynt Bernarde ſayth in his
medytacōns. There ſhall be herde we
pynge & gnaſtyng of teeth / roryng of
fendes & hydeous thondre. There yt
ſyght ſhal be foule / wormes / todes / adders
/ & horryble faces of the fendes &
myſſhape thynges. There wycked
wormes ſhall gnawe the herte rotes / there
ſhall be ſorowe & ſyghynge and
horryble drede. There ſynfull wretches
ſhall brenne in the fyre without
ende. In ther bodye they ſhall be tourmented
by fyre / & in ther ſoule by worme
of conſcyence. There ſhall be deth
without deth / for alwaye they ſhall
be in deynge and in vtter payne and
may not dye / but alwaye lyue in deynge
There ſmellynge ſhall be fylled
with horryble ſtenche / for there ſhall
be no hope. But whan they be in theſe
paynes ten hondred yeres / yet ther

payne in newe all to begynne. And
therfore yf loue of god & mede in heuen
ſtyreth vs not to flee lecherye and
all other ſynnes / lette vs flee lecherye
& all other ſynnes for drede of endeleſſe
payne.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .xvi.
               ANd an nother remedy ayenſt
lechery is to thynke of yt harde
vengeaūces yt god hath take
for lecherye. Fyrſt take hede what
vengeaūce god hath take for ſymple
fornycacōn. We fynde in holy wryt.
Gen̄ .xxxiiij. That Dyua yt doughter
of Iacob went fro home to ſee yt wymen
of that contre & to ſee ther atyre
Than Sychem yt ſone of Emor prynce
of yt contre wente & defouled this
Dyua by myght. And not withſtandyng
his beſynes for to haue wedded
hyr / yet he was ſlayne for his lechery
& his fader & all the men of yt cyte / &
that cyte deſtroyed. We rede alſo in
holy wryt Numeri .xxv. For yt the childeren
of Iſraell dyde lecherye w
                     •
                   the
wymen of Moab / god was offended / &
bad Moyſes take yt prynces of his
people & hange theym vpon Iebetes / for
they were aſſentynge to the ſynne
/ & bad euery man ſlee his neyghbour
that was gylty in yt ſynne. For
by lecherye they felle in to ydolatrye.
And ſo for yt lecherye were ſlayn that
tyme .xxiiij. thouſande. Than Phynees
the ſone of Eleazar ſawe one
of yt childern of Iſraell by one of the
wymen / & to venge his ſynne he toke
his ſwerde & roof them both togydre
in to the erthe throughe theyr preuy
membres. And god was ſo moche pleſed
with his dede / that he graūted to
hym & to his childern after hym the
dygnyte of preeſthode without ende.
For but he had do that dede god ſholde
ellys haue deſtroyed the people. Alſo
for auoutrye & vnlawfull wedloke
all mankynde was deſtroyed in tyme
of Noes flood ſaue .viij. ſoules. Gen̄.
vi. And for defoulynge of one mannes
wyfe were ſlayne thre ſcore thouſande
& fyue thouſande & all a contre
/ and a grete cyte deſtroyed at the
byddynge of god. Iudicū .xix. et .xx.
Alſo Dauyd for auoutrye was dreuen
out of his kyngdom / and he & al
his houſholde & all his kynrede were
afterwarde full harde punyſſhed for
his lecherye .ij. Re .xi. et .xij. And by
the olde lawe both man and woman
ſholde be ſlayne yf they were take in
auoutrye. We rede that Iudas the ſone
of Iacob hadde thre ſones by one
woman. Her Onam & Selam. But
Her yt was the eldeſt ſone was a ſhrewe
& myſuſed his owne wyfe / wherfore
god was wrothe with hym and
ſlough hym with ſodayne deth / for he
vſed his wyfe in luſte & wolde not by
gete childern of hyr / but dyde ſo yt ſhe
ſholde not conceyue. Gen̄ .xxxviij. Alſo
for lecherye ſeuen huſbondes of Sara
that was afterwarde the wyfe of
yonge Thobye were ſlayne of yt tende
for ther foule luſte. Thobie .vi. Alſo
for lecherye of them yt be of kynre
de & of affynyte / god hath take harde
wrath / as whan Aamon lay by his
ſyſter Thamer / he was ſlayne of his
broder Abſolon. And Loth the broder

of Abraham by dronkenſhyp lay by
his owne two doughters & bygate of
them two childern Moab & Amon / whiche
childern & the people that came
of theym were alwaye enemyes
to goddes folke & acurſed of god. Alſo
Iacob curſed his ſone Ruben for
he laye with one of his wyues. Alſo
for the foule ſynne of Sodome fyue
fayre cytees Sodom & Gomor & other
thre cytees were deſtroyed in tyme
of Abraham. For god rayned vpon
them fyre & brymſtone from aboue.
And the erthe ſhoke ſo & trembled
that they ſonke downe in to helle houſe / londe
/ man & childe / and beeſt & all
that they had. There was no thyng
ſaued but Loth & his two doughters
his wyfe myght haue be ſaued / but
for that ſhe loked ayen to the cyte ayenſt
the angels byddynge / whan ſhe
herde the ſorowfull crye of them that
peryſſhed / therfore ſhe tourned in to
a ſalt ſtone. For the angell bad them
ſtreytly yt they ſholde not loke ayen.
And all yt contre whiche was byfore
lykened to paradyſe for fayreneſſe &
plente of the contre / tourned in to a
foule ſtynkynge podell yt laſteth in to
this daye / & is called the deed ſee. For
ther may noo thynge lyue therin for
fylth & ſtenche in vengeaūce of yt ſtynkynge
lecherye. Gen̄ .xij. ¶Diues.
Me meruayleth moche yt god toke ſo
general wrath to ſlee man & woman
and childe. For I am ſyker ther were
many childern full yonge & vngylty
in that ſynne. Alſo we fynde not that
wymen were than gylty in that ſynne.
The boke ſayth that all the people
of men fro the childe male to the
olde cam to do yt ſynne / but of wymen
ſpeketh he not that ony cam therto.
¶Pauper. Though woman vſe not
yt ſynne / yet they were gylty in yt that
they forſoke not ther huſbondes that
were gylty. For ſodomye is mooſt ſuffycyent
cauſe of dyuorce bytwene huſbonde
& wyfe whan it is openly vſed
And ſyth they wolde not forſake ther
huſbondes in yt horryble ſynne / in maner
they aſſented to ther ſynne / & ſoo
ryghtfully they peryſſhed in ſynne
with them. Of the childern vngylty
the mayſter of ſtoryes ſayth / that god
ſlough them for ther beſt. For yf they
hadde lyued forth in to myghty age
they ſholde haue folowed the lechery
of ther faders / and ſo it was better to
theym to dye or they were gylty / than
to haue lyued lenger & dyed gylty and
go to helle without ende.

               DIues. Fell there ony vengeaunce
for lechery of men of
holy chirche. ¶Pauper. We
fynde in the ſeconde boke of kynges
vi.ca. That ther was a deken in y• olde
lawe whos name was Oza. And
whan he touched yt hutche eyther arke
of god to holde it vp whan it ſholde
els haue falle / his ryght arme ſeryd &
dryed ſodaynly / & anone he dyed. For
as the mayſter of ſtoryes ſayth. That
nyght he had deled wt his wyf. Syth
than the deken of the olde lawe was
ſo hard punyſſhed for he touched goddes
hutche yt els ſholde haue falle / for
he medled yt nyght with his wyfe / moche

preſume to touche goddes bodye or to

And therfore the lawe byddeth ſtreytely

And in an other place the lawe byddeth

Alſo lecherye is more ſynne in men

bycauſe of the perſone. For men of holy

in connynge & vertue. And therfore
god ſayth in the goſpell. That the

& not doynge his wyl ſhall be harde
punyſſhed. Alſo for his vnkyndeneſſe
/ for why / the gretter his benefyce

more is he boūde to god & the more
is his ſynne yf he be vnkynde. And
therfore holy wryt ſayth. Potentes potenter

more to his perſone / both for his
dygnyte and for the vowe of his chaſtyte
that he made in takynge of holy
ordre. Not for defaute of the ſacrament.
For the ſacrament is not the
worſe for the malyce of the preeſte.
But therfore this lawe forbyddeth

               DIues. Whether is lecherye
more ſynne in wedded folke / or
in men of holy chirche.
¶Pauper. In lecherye be many degrees
as I ſayd before. For auoutrye
is more ſynne than is ſymple fornycacyon
But inceſte that is lechery with
theym that be nyghe of kynne / is more
than auoutrye. And ſacrylege that
is lecherye in theym that haue auowed
chaſtyte as in men of holy chirche
/ and in men of relygyon alſo / is
more than auoutrye. Hec lū.

of the vowe of chaſtyte / is more
than auoutrye. And alſo his ſynne is
more greuous / for it is more ſclaunderous
and noyous to the people / for his
wycked enſample. And therfor ſaynt
Gregorye ſayth that they ſhall anſwere
for as many ſoules as peryſſhe
by theyr wycked enſample. For whan
the hede and the leder falleth / the bodye
lyghtly ſhall falle. And more dyſcomforte
it is to an ooſt yf they ſee
theyr chefteyne flee / and tourne the
backe / than though they ſee twenty
other ſymple men tourne the backe &
flee / and more confort to the enmyes
And ſoo it is of men of holy chirche
that ſholde be leders of cryſten people
For they tourne the backe to god and
flee out of goddes ooſt as oft as they
falle in dedely ſynne. Alſo it is more
greuous in men of holy chirche / for
they may better flee lecherye than mē
of the worlde. For it nedeth not them

               DIues. Why be men yrreguler
for bygamye. ¶Pauper. For
many cauſes. Fyrſt for dygnyte
& honeſte of holy ordre / & of the ſacramentes
of holy chirche. Alſo to ſhe
we token and example of contynence
and of chaſtyte. Diſtinc .xxxij. poſuiſti.
For he that ſhall preche contynence
& chaſtyte / muſte ſhewe contynence
and chaſtyte in hymſelfe. Alſo for
ther is not full ſacrament of matrymonye.
And he that ſhall mynyſtre
the ſacramentes of holy chirche / muſt
haue noo defaute in ony ſacrament.
Wherfore thou ſhalt vnderſtande as
I ſayd fyrſte. The ſacrament of matrymonye
betokeneth the vnyte and
the knot bytwene cryſte and holy chirche
/ as bytwene one huſbonde & one
wyfe mayden without ſpot. As ſaynt
Poule ſayth / and that is betokened
by the coniunccyon and knyttynge to
gydre bodely of huſbonde and wyfe
in matrymonye. Alſo yt bodely knyttynge
to gydre in matrymonye betokeneth

the vnyte and the knot bytwene
the godhede and the manhede in
the chambre of the mayde Marye / whiche
knot and vnyte and matrymonye
began in tyme of patryarkes
and prophetes / and it was made ſeker
and ſtable in the tyme of grace in
the byrthe of cryſte and his paſſyon.
But it ſhall be full endeth and made
parfyght in heuen blyſſe. And therfor
layth laynt An
                     ••
                  en in queſtionibus
Oroſij. That as god made woman
of the ryb of Adam ſlepyng & of his
ſyde / ſoo out of the ſyde of cryſte ſlepynge
vpon the croſſe ranne blood &
water / whiche be the ſacramentes of
our redempcōn / by whiche ſacramentes
holy chirche is fourmed & wedded
to cryſte as Eue to Adam. Alſo matrymonye
betokeneth the vnyte & the
knot bytwene cryſte & cryſten ſoule / and
that pryncypaly for the gooſtely
knot that is bytwene the huſbonde &
wyfe in aſſent of ther wylles. For as
moche than as he that is in bygamye
is not only one huſbonde to one clene
wyf / as cryſte is one huſbonde to one
holy chirche mayden. Or the wyfe is
not only wyfe bodely to one huſbonde
/ but the huſbonde hath departed
his fleſſhe in two wyues / or the wyfe
departed hyr fleſſhe in two men / therfore
ther is defaute in that ſacramēt
of matrymonye. For it ſygnefyeth
not perfyghtly the vnyte bytwene cryſte
& holy chirche. And in many maner
man falleth in bygamye & ſo in
yrregularyte. Fyrſte yf he haue two
wyues lawfully one after an other &
knoweth them fleſſhly. Alſo yf he haue
two to gydre or mo / as one by the
lawe openly & by dome of holy chirche
/ and an other by lawe of conſcyence
& knowe them fleſſhely. Alſo yf he
haue two on yt maner one after a nother
& knoweth theym fleſſhly. Alſo
yf he haue wedded a wedowe corrupte.
Alſo yf he wedde ony woman corrupte
of an other man / where he knoweth
hyr corrupte or knoweth it not.
Alſo yf he knewe fleſſhely his owne
wyfe after that ſhe is knowe of a nother
/ whether he knoweth it or knoweth
it not. Alſo yf ony man of holy
chirche or profeſſed in relygyon wedde
a woman & medle with hyr / be ſhe
mayde or corrupte / he is yrreguler.

In all theſe caſes man is yrreguler.
¶Diues. Though the man be not
mayde whan he weddeth a mayde / is
he not yrreguler for his owne corrupco
n
/ why is he than yrreguler for corrupcōn
of the woman. For it ſemeth
that his owne corrupcyon ſholde rather
make hym yrreguler / than the
corrupcōn of the woman. ¶Pauper
In the coniunccyon of cryſte to holy
chirche is vnyte and onehede in both
partes. And therfor yf eyther man or
woman in matrymonye hath departed
his fleſſhe byfore / there is a defaute
in that matrymonye / as anentes
that ſacrament. For ther matrymonye
betokeneth not parfyghtely the
matrymonye bytwene cryſte & holy

chirche. But more onehede and clenneſſe
is nedefull in the woman than
in the man. For in the man it is nede
full yt he haue wedded no woman by
fore fleſſhely but one / but it nedeth
not yt he be a mayde / but in the woman
it is nedeful yt ſhe be not corrupt
byfore of ony other man. ¶Diues.
By what reaſon. ¶Pauper. For the
corrupcyon of matrymonye cauſeth
not yrregularyte in hym that is corrupte
/ but it cauſeth yrregularyte in
the other yt is knytte to hym. For that
dede of corrupcyon falleth not than
on him that dyd the dede / but on him
that is knyt to hym in matrymonye.
And therfore ryght as the man is
not yrreguler for he is corrupte hymſelf
whan he weddeth / but for he weddeth
a woman corrupt / ryght ſoo yf
woman were able to holy ordre / ſhe
ſholde be yrreguler / not for that ſhe
is corrupt / but for that ſhe knytteth
hyr to a man corrupt / but ſhe had be
corrupt byfore in other matrymonye.
An other reaſon may be this. For the
knot and vnyte made bytwene cryſte
and holy chirche / and bytwene the
godhede and the manhede / it is one
and ones made for euer. Therfore it
is betokened by the bodely knyttynge
to gydre of the fyrſt matrymonye
But whan man paſſeth to the ſeconde
wyfe and weddeth alſo bodely / or
yf ſhe be corrupt / than gooth he from
vnyte to pluralyte. Therfore the ſeconde
matrymonye may not fygure
parfyghtly the coniunccyon of cryſte
to holy chirche / ne of the godhede to
the manhede / whiche coniunccyon is
one / & but ones done for euer / and not
chaūgeable. For there the thynge betokened
is but one / the thynhe betokenynge
that thynge muſte be one. And
the thynge betokened & ye thynge betokenynge
yt thynge muſte be lyke. Alſo
more clenneſſe is nedeful to the woman
to ſaue the ſacramēt of matrymony
than in y• man / for the woman
betokeneth holy chirche wedded to cryſte
/ whiche as ſaynt Poule ſayth muſt
be clene mayde without ſpot. Alſo the
woman betokeneth manhede of cryſte
that he toke of the mayde Marye
without parte of man. Alſo the woman
betokeneth cryſten ſoule whiche
muſte be without corrupcōn of ſynne
yf it ſhall be cryſtus ſpouſe. For theſe
reſons / to ſaue the ſacrament of matrymonye
/ y• woman muſt be mayden
¶Diues. I ſuppoſe a man had defouled
a mayden / & after that he wedded
hyr / is he yrreguler for he weddeth
that woman ſo corrupte. ¶Pauper.
Some clerkes ſaye ye and ſome nay
But yt mooſt comon opynyon is that
he is not yrreguler / for he departed not
his fleſſhe in to an other wyfe / ſo that
the mayden be not defouled of a nother.

¶Pauper. The wordes of ſaynt
Poule be thus to vnderſtande. That
there may noo man be preeſt yt hath

bygamus. ¶Diues. What yf a man

And yf he wedde a mayde & ſhe medle

huſbonde medle with hyr after yt ſhe

this clerkes ſaye yt Abraham was excuſed.
For it was the maner amonges
the good peple of god yt tyme that yf
the wyfe were bareyne / by ther bothe
aſſent yt huſbonde myght take hym a
ſecondarye wyfe / not for luſte / but only
to multeplye goddes people. And ſo
Abraham by aſſent of his wyfe & by
the preuy leue of god / not for luſte / but
for to haue a childe to goddes worſhyp

toke Agar to his wyfe. And ſo
ſhe was his ſecondarye wyfe / & Sara
the cheef wyfe. And alſo ſo had Iacob
foure wyues lefully not for luſte.
but for to multeplye goddes people / and
for token of thynges that were
to come. And that was do by auctoryte
of dyſpenſacyon of god / whiche is
aboue al lawes. But though god dyſpen
s;ed
with Abraham & Sara to do
in that maner / or with Iacob to haue
many wyues to gydre / for fygure &

not take now this tyme example therof

And he medled neuer with other woman

               DIues. I haue often herde
ſayd that fendes in mannes
lykeneſſe haue layen by wymen
and made theym with childe.
and that is wonderfull to me. For
the fende is but a ſpyryte / and hath
neyther fleſſhe ne bone / ne ony thynge
of mankynde wherby yt he ſholde
gendre with woman. ¶Pauper:
The fende by ſuffraunce of god may
ſadde the ayer and make hym a bodye
of the ayer in what lykeneſſe god
ſuffreth hym / in ſo moche yt as ſayth
ſaynt Poule. He tranſfygureth hymſelfe
in to an angell of lyght. Moche
more than he may tranſfygure hym
in to lykeneſſe of man or woman by
ſuffraūce of god / for mannes ſynne &
womans. And the fendes that tempt
folke to lecherye be mooſt beſye to appere
in mannes lykeneſſe & womans
to do lecherye with folke & ſo brynge

them to lecherye. And in ſpeche of folke
they be called eluys. But in latyn
whan they appere in mānes lykenes
they be called Incubi. And whan they
appere in lykenes of wymen / they be
called Succubi. And for they haue no
mater ne ſede of themſelfe to gendre
therfore they gendre and take the ſuperfluyte
of the mater & ſede of man
that paſſeth from man ſlepynge and
other tymes / & with that mater they
medle with wymen. Alſo they gadre
mater and ſede of woman / and with
that medle with man in womans lykeneſſe.
And of ſuche medlynge as
god ſuffereth comen ſomtyme good
childern / ſomtyme wycked / ſomtyme
well ſhapen / ſomtyme euyll ſhapen.
But nedes one muſte be man or woman
/ for fende with fende may not
gendre. Suche fendes be mooſt beſye
to ſhende wymen. And therfore it is
peryllous to wymen that deſyren moche
mannes companye / to be ouermoche
ſolytarye without honeſt companye.
And ſuche foule ſpyrytes do therlecherye
in this maner / not only with
man and woman / but alſo with vnreſonable
beſtes / and appere to them
in lykeneſſe of beſtes / as a bole to kyne
/ and as a ram to ſhepe. And ſo
by the fendes doynge come many of
theſe myſſhape thynges that be borne
both of wymen & of beſtes / as a calfe
with an adders tayle / a childe with
an adders hede / a childe borne of a

               DIues. It maye be well as
y• ſayeſt / but I praye the telle
me what is gooſtly fornycacōn
/ goſtly auoutre / & lechery. ¶Pauper
All thre be take for one / and pryncypally
it is called ydolatrye / whan
man or woman withdraweth his loue
and his truſte fro god and ſetteth
it more in creatures than in god / and
the worſhyp that longeth to the godhede
dooth it to creatures / thankynge
creatures of the benefyces that onely
god may doo. And ſoo the worſhyp yt
longeth onely to god / they gyue it to
creatures / ſtocke or ſtone / man or woman
/ or to ymages made with mannes
hondes / that neyther may ſee / here
/ ne helpe at nede. Whan man or
woman is cryſtened / his ſoule is wedded
to cryſte by ryght byleue and trewe
loue and charyte that he behoteth
there to god to kepe his byheſtes and
to forſake the fende. But after whan
he forſaketh god & goddes byheſtes / and
tourneth him to the fende by his
owne fyndynges of mys luſtes & leueth
the loue of cryſte for the loue of
ony creature than he doth gooſtly lecherye
with the fende. And therfore
ſayth Dauyd / yt they haue do fornycaco

in ther owne fyndynges. And on
this maner all fleſſhely thought & al
mys luſte & vnryghtfull doynge & vnleful
couetyſe in that it withdraweth
the loue of man or of woman fro god
it is called gooſtly fornycacōn and auoutrye.
And thus euery dedely ſynne
is called gooſtly auoutrye & gooſtely
fornycacyon / but pryncypaly ydolatrye
& forſakynge of the fayth. Alſo

falſe prechynge / & falſe expoſycōn of
holy wryt is called ſpyrytuell fornycacyon.
As they that preche pryncypaly

couetyſe is called gooſtly fornycacy
on. Therfore ſaynt Iames ſayth to

of this worlde is enmye to god.
Therfore in the boke of goddes preuytees

For as ſaynt Poule ſayth. Couetyſe is

god byddeth there that his people
ſholde go out of the cyte of Babylon
That is to ſaye / forſake ſynfull companye

               DIues. All though thy ſpeche
de reſonable / yet in one thynge
clerkes holde ayenſt the in
that that thou ſayſt that the ſynne of
Adam was more than the ſynne of
Eue. And they argue thus ayenſt the
God ryghtfull Iuge punyſſhed Eue
hard for hyr ſynne than he dyd Adam
for his ſynne / but yt ſholde not god haue
do / but for hyr ſȳne was more greuous
than y• ſynne of Adam / therfore
the ſynne of Eue was more greuous
than Adams ſynne. ¶Pauꝑ. This
argument is grounded in two falſe
maximis. Fyrſte that euery punyſſhynge
and vengeaunce aſſygned of
god for mannes ſynne and womans
is aſſygned after yt the ſynne is more
or leſſe. And this maxime & groūde is
falſe / wherfor thou ſhalt vnderſtande
that god punyſſhe ſome ſynne in this
worlde / and ſome in the other worlde
ſome bothe here & there. In the other
worlde he punyſſheth euery ſynne
after that it is more greuous / or
leſſe greuous. But in this worlde he

dooth not alwaye ſo. But oft in this
worlde he punyſſheth the leſſe ſynne
harder than he doth the more ſynne.
Therfore in the olde lawe auoutrye
was punyſſhed as harde or hard than
manſlaughter / & yet manſlaughter is
more greuous ſynne than auoutrye / &
god toke more temporall vengeūce in
this worlde for lecherye / than euer he
dyd for ydolatrye / & yet ydolatrye is
gretter ſynne than lechery / for it is in
medyat ayenſt god & ayenſt y• fyrſt cō
                  maundement
of the fyrſte table. And
manſlaughter is harder punyſſhed in
this world than periurye / & yet ꝑiurye
is gretter ſynne / as I ſayd in y• ſeconde
cōmaūdement. And ſynnes in ſymple
poore folk be harder punyſſhed in
this worlde / than ſynnes of the grete
men. Yf a poore man ſtele an horſe / he
ſhal be hanged. But yf a lorde by
raueyn & extorcyons robbe a man of
all y• he hath / he ſhall not be hanged
ne lytyll or nought punyſſhed in this
worlde. Dauyd dyde auoutre & man
ſlaughter / for whiche ſynne he was
worthy to be ſlayne by comon lawe
of god / & yet god wolde not haue hȳ
ſlayn / but yf a poore man had do tho
ſynnes / he ſholde haue be ſlayne. A
ſymple man went & gadred ſtyckes in
the ſabot / & god had Moyſes ſtone hȳ
to deth. Salomon Ieroboam Acham
dyd grete ydolatrye / & drough moche
of the people to ydolatrye / & yet were
they not ſlayn / therfore the ſmaller
ſynnes god punyſſhed in this worlde
yt the ſoules be punyſſhed in this worlde
ſo yt the ſoules of the ſynners may
be ſaued yf they take it pacyently / &
comonly he punyſſhed hard poore folke
in this worlde than the ryche folke
as by comon lawe. For the ſynne of
grete men / as in y• ſame ſpyce of ſynne
is more greuous than is the ſynne
of the poore man. And therfore god
reſerueth the greuous ſynnes and the
ſynnes of grete folke for to punyſſhe
them in the other worlde / or in helle
or in purgatorye. There may no temporall
payne be full punyſſhynge for
dedely ſynne ſaue contrycyon allone.
And therfore god punyſſheth not alwaye
folke in this worlde after the
quātyte of ther ſynne / but as he ſeeth
it mooſt nedefull & ſpedefull to y• people
and to his worſhyp. For only god
knoweth the greuouſhede of dedely
ſynne. For oft yt yt ſemeth mooſt greuoꝰ
in mannes ſyght / is leſſe greuous
in goddes ſyght / & ayenwarde. Therfore
god melureth not alwaye payne
after the quantyte of the ſynne.
But oft he punyſſheth in this worlde
them that be leſſe gylty / as moche
as theym that be more gylty. And in
tyme of the flood of Noe / & in the pery
s;ſhynge
of Sodom and Gomor / and
many other tymes he punyſſhed
wymen childern and beſtes that were
not gylty in the ſynnes for whiche
that vengeaunce felle. And oft he ſendeth
ſykenes & dyſeaſe to good men / in
punyſſhyng of ther ſynnes in this
worlde / and ſuffereth ſhrewes to haue
ther wyll / and lytyll or nought puny
s;ſheth
them in this worlde. And as
the lyon is chaſtyſed by betynge of
the whelpe / ſo oftyme god punyſſheth
& chaſtyſeth ful harde in this worlde

them that be leſſe gylty / to warne thē
that be more gylty that they ſholde
amende them. Therfore cryſte ſayd
to the Iewes / wene ye yt tho men whiche
Py
                     •
                  at ſlough for theyr rebellyon
were gretter ſynners than other folke
of the contre. Nay forſoth. But I ſay
to you forſoth / but ye amende you / ye
ſhall peryſſhe all. And wene ye ſayth
cryſte that the .xviij. men vpon whiche
felle the toure of Syloa in Ierlm
and ſlough them / wene ye that they
paſſed in ſynne all the men of Ieruſalem.
Nay forſoth. But I ſay to you
but ye amende you / ye ſhall peryſſhe
all to gydre. Luce.xiij. And ſo the punyſſhynge
of tho men ſo ſlayne was
a warnynge to them that were more
ſynfull that they ſholde amende
theym. And ſoo thou myghteſt well
ſee that thy reaſon is nought worthy / god
punyſſhed Eue harder in this
worlde than he dyde Adam / therfore
hyr ſynne was more than the ſynne
of Adam.
            
            
               
                  Caplm .xxiiij.
               ALſo the ſeconde maxime and
grounde in whiche thou ſayſte
that god punyſſhed Eue
harder than Adam may reſonably be
denyed. For in punyſſhynge of Adam
god gaf his curſe and ſayd. Curſed
be the erthe in thy werke & in thy ſynne
He ſayd not curſed be the erthe in
thy werke of Eue / ne he ſayd not / curſed
be the erthe in your werke / as for
comon ſynne of them bothe / but he
ſayd only to Adam. Curſed be y• erth
in thy werke. In punyſſhynge alſo
of the ſerpent he gaf his curſe & ſayd
Thou ſhalt be curſed amonges alle
thynge lyuynge vpon erthe. Alſo god
curſed Caym whan he punyſſhed hȳ
for ſleynge of his brother Abell. But
whan god punyſſhed woman / he gaue
not his curſe. And we rede not that
euer god gaue his curſe to ony woman
openly in ſpecyaall. Ne god repreued
not Eue ſo moche as he dyde
Adam. And ſo the grete repreue & blamynge
& the curſe yt god gaue in punyſſhyng
of Adam more than he dyd
in punyſſhyng of Eue / ſhewyng well
yt the ſynne of Adam was more greuous
than was the ſynne of Eue / & yt
there was more ob
                     •
                  tynacy in Adam
than was in Eue. For curſyng is not
gyuen of god ne of holy chirche / but
for obſtynacy. As I ſayd fyrſt Adam
anſwered full obſtynatly. God blamed
Adam prȳcypaly for brekyng of
his cōmaundement & ſayd to hym yt
brekynge of his cōmaūdement was
cauſe of his nakedneſſe & of his ſodayne
myſcheef / and notwithſtange
the techynge and the ſtyrynge of god
he wolde not be aknowen of his ſynne
/ but put his ſynne on god / and excuſed
hym by Eue / and ſoo put ſynne
to ſynne in excuſacyon of his ſynne.
Whan god punyſſhed Adam he curſed
the erthe for his ſynne / whiche curſe
tourned to woo & trauayle of hym
& of all mankynde whiche we maye
not flee. And therfore ha ſayd to Adam
/ thou ſhalt ete of the erth in trauayle
and ſorowe all the dayes of thy
lyfe. I ſhall brynge the forth brerys &
thornes / & thou ſhalt ete herbes of the

erthe. Alſo in punyſſhynge of Adam
god gaf the ſentence of deth vpon hȳ
& all mankynde for his ſynne. And
therfor god ſayd to Adam / yu ſhalt ete
thy brede in ſwynke & ſwete of thy face
tyll yu tourne ayen in to the erthe.
For erthe yu art / & in to erthe ayen thou
ſhalt wende. Sythen than god for
the ſynne of Adam gaf ſo greuouſly
his curſe / and blamed ſo harde Adam
of his ſynne / and for his ſynne dampned
hym and all mankynde / and punyſſhed
all erthely creatures for his
ſynne & dampned hym and all man
kynde to perpetuel trauayle whan he
ſayd. Thou ſhalt ete thy mete with
trauayle & ſorowe al the dayes of thy
lyfe. And alſo for the ſynne of Adam
he gaf ſentence of deth to hym and
to all mankynde that is mooſt of all
paynes / it foloweth that god punyſſhed
harder Adam for his ſynne / than
he dyde Eue for hyr ſynne. For why
in punyſſhynge of Eue god repreued
hyr not ſo moche as he dyde Adam.
& he gaf than no curſe ne payne perpetuell
ſaue ſubieccyon. I ſhall ſayd
god multeplye thy myſcheues & thy
conceyuynges / & in ſorowe yu ſhalt bere
thy childern / and yu ſhalt be vnder
power of man & he ſhall be thy lorde.
God ſayd not to woman. I ſhall
multeplye thy myſcheues all dayes
of thy lyfe. For ſhe may kepe hyr chaſte
yf ſhe wyll and flee myſcheef and
payne of childern byrthe. And that
god made woman ſuget to man for
the ſynne of Eue / it was noo newe
thynge to woman. For as ſaynt Auſten
ſayth ſuꝑ Gen̄.li.xi.ca.xiiij. Woman
was ſuget to man byfore by ordre
of kynde / but that ſubieccōn was
only by loue and charyte / but for hyr
ſynne ſhe was made ſuget / not only
by loue / but alſo by nede & bondage
of honeſte ſeruyle werkes to obeye to
man and be vnder his gouernaunce.
Byfore hyr ſynne ſhe was ſugette to
man only by loue / but after hyr ſynne
ſhe was made ſuget to man / not
only by loue but by drede & by nede.
For ſhe muſte drede man & ſhe hath
nede of his helpe. For yt was the pryde
of Adam & of Eue / that they deſyred
to haue noo ſouerayne ne gouernour
but god allone as clerkes ſaye.
And therfore ye fende in gyle behyght
them yt they deſyred ſaynge to Eue yf
ye ete of ye tree yt god hath forbode you
ye ſhall be as goddes knowynge gode
& euyll / that is to ſaye / ye ſhall nede
noo ſouerayne ne gouernour to teche
you ne to gouerne you but god / &
for that they deſyred it lyghtely they
byleued it. For as the mayſter of ſtoryes
ſayth. A thynge that is deſyred / lyghtly
it is byleued. And therfor god
ryghtfull Iuge punyſſhed them bothe
in ſubieccyon of drede and of nede
/ and of harde ſeruage. He made
woman ſuget to man / and afterwarde
he made man ſuget and thrall to
man for the ſynne of Adam as ſayth
ſaynt Auſten ſuꝑ Gen̄.v.ſup. More
than euer he made woman ſuget to
man. For the ſynne of Eue as ſayth
ſaynt Auſten ſuꝑ Gen̄.v.s. For thoughe
woman be in thraldome to temporell
lordes as be men / yt is not for ye
ſynne of Eue / but pryncypaly for the

ſynne of Adam. The ſubieccōn yt woman
is put in for y• ſynne of Eue / is
the ſubieccōn yt the wyfe ought to hyr
huſbonde. And all the ſoueraynte and
lordſhyp that ony man hath here in
this worlde / eyther ouer man or woman
/ it is medled with moche woo &
grete ſorowe & care. For euery ſouerayne
in this worlde muſte care for
his ſugettes yf he be wyſe. And in hygher
degree that he be of lordſhyp &
of dygnyte / in the hygher degre is he
of peryll / of drede / of ſorowe / & care
in punyſſhyng of Adams ſynne. And
ſo both lordſhyp in this worlde & ſubiecco
n
be punyſſhed of Adams ſynne
And yf ſugettes can haue pacyence
with theyr degre / they be in more ſykernes
both of bodye & of ſoule / & in
more gladnes of herte than be the ſouerayns
And ſo punyſſhed god Adam
as moche in maner / in that he made
hym lorde & gouernour of woman as
he punyſſhed Eue whan he made hyr
ſuget to Adam. For in that god bonde
man to haue cure of woman in
hyr myſcheef to ſaue hyr and to kepe
hyr that was by comon ſo faynte / ſo
feble & freell / and ſo myſchyuous by
cauſe of hyr ſynne.

               DIues. Yet clerkes argue ayenſt
the & ſay yt woman ſynned
more greuouſly than Adam
/ for ſhe put hyrſelf in ſȳne & hyr
huſbonde Adam / but Adam put only
hȳſelfe in ſynne. ¶Pauper This reſon
is nought. For as I ſayd fyrſt Adam
was ſhent with preuy pryde and
welth of hȳſelfe & fell in to ſynne or
Eue pro
                     •
                  ced hym y• apple. Alſo ſayth
ſaynt Auſten de ci.dei.li.xiiij.ca.xi.
Adam wyſte well yt it was a greuous
ſynne / but Eue was ſo deſceyued that
ſhe wende yt it had be no ſynne. And
therfore the ſynne that ſhe dyd by Ignorau
ce
& deſceyte of the fende excuſeth
not / ne leſſeth not the ſynne of
Adam yt he dyd wyllynge & wyttyngly
Adam was hyr ſouerayne & ſholde
haue gouerned them both and not
obeye to the voyce of his wyfe ayenſt
the voyce of god that forbadde hym
the tree. Example / yf a ſymple man
be vnconnynge / and by deſceyte of ſome
ſhrewe do a foly wenynge not to
do amys / and he come to his prelate
or his byſſhop & counſeyll hym to do
the ſame / and his prelate or his byſſhop
do the ſame wetynge well that
he doth amys / and that it is a greuouſe
ſynne / euery man wyll deme that
the byſſhop and his prelate ſynneth
more greuouſly than the ſymple man
that wende not to do amys. And thus
nyghe all circumſtaūces tha
                     •
                   aggreggen
ony ſynne aggregged the ſynne
of Adam more than y• ſynne of Eue
For he was ſouerayne and parfyght
more in kynde / wyſer and myghtyer
to withſtande the fendes fodynge / and
with leſſe temptacōn fell in ſynne
& brake goddes cōmaūdement wityngly

Alſo Adam was more obſtynat
than Eue was. ¶Diues. Shewe me
that. ¶Pauper. For god blamed hȳ
fyrſt of all / & declared to hym his ſynne
/ & god abode of punyſſhynge tyll
he had vndernomen Eue / and after
Eue the fende in the adder / & fyrſte
he punyſſhed the adder / & than Eue
that Adam ſholde haue beware and
axed mercy. And ſo god blamed hym
fyrſt & punyſſhed hȳ laſt / ſo gyuyng
him reſpyte to repentaūce. But for al
this Adam repented hym not / ne wol
de axe mercy ne lowe him. Fyrſte god
punyſſhed hym fro fer in y• adder in
that yt he curſed the adder yt was his
ſuget & made the adder enmye to his
wyfe & to hyr ſede / yt is to ſaye to ther
childern yt ſhe ſholde get of Adam / &
ſo god made the adder that was byfore
ſuget & meke to hym rebell & enemye
to his loue yt was his wyf & to al
yt ſholde come of them two / yet Adam
ſtode obſtynat. Than god punyſſhed
Eue his wyf his loue his helpe / & ſo
punyſſhed hȳ in Eue / for yf he loued
hyr ſo moche as clerkes ſay / it ſholde
haue be to hym ful grete payne to ſee
his wyf his loue ſo punyſſhed. For as
clerkes ſaye / the grete loue yt he had
to Eue made hym to breke y• cōmaū
                  dement
of god. And yet now a dayes
it is full grete payne to kynde folke
trewe in loue to ſee ther loue & theyr
frendes in ſorowe and dyſeaſe. Alſo
god punyſſhed Adam & Eue in that
yt he punyſſhed hyr with myſcheues
of ſykeneſſe / freelte & febleneſſe. For
in ſoo moche god toke from hym his
helpe that was woman made to be
mannes helpe. But the more feble
that god made hyr for ſynne / the leſſe
ſhe myght helpe man. Alſo god punyſſhed
theym both anone as Adam
ete of the tree / & made them ſo naked
& ſoo vnhoneſte that they were aſhamed
of themſelfe / whiche payne felle
not to Adam ne to Eue tyll Adam
had ete of y• apple. And notwithſtandynge
all this / yet Adam ſtode obſtynate
& axed no mercy ne knowleged
no ſynne. And than god ryghtfull
Iuge punyſſhed hym full harde both
in this worlde & in the other worlde / and
punyſſhed all mankynde for his
ſynne. As ſaynt Poule ſayth and
ſaynt Auſten and other doctoures.
God punyſſhed Adam and mankynde
full harde for his ſynne / whan
he toke moche of his lordſhyp a waye
from hym and made nyghe all creatures
rebelle to hym / & brought hym
ſoo lowe in ordre of kynde / yt though
by way of kynde man byfore Adams
ſynne paſſeth woman in vertue and
perfeccnn of kynde. Now after Adames
ſynne woman ofte tyme paſſeth

many men in vertue and in dyſcrecy
on / and in other gyftes bothe of kynde
and of grace. And byfore the ſynne
of Adam / man was ſoo ſouerayne
to woman / that woman ſholde
not haue be his ſouerayne. But now
for Adams ſynne oftentymes man
is ſuget to woman as to his lady by
bondage and thraldome / by harde ſeruage
/ by nede and drede / and ought
more ſeruage and ſubieccyon to woman
for Adams ſynne / than dooth
woman to man for the ſynne of Eue
For god made woman for the ſynne
of Eue only ſuget to hyr huſbonde in
ſeruyce of honeſte werkes as felowe
not as chorle in werkes of worldly
bondage. Alſo man for the ſynne of
Adam is ordeyned to many more perylles
bothe on londe and on water / and
to warre and to woo / and beſyneſſe
of this worlde / and to moche
trauayle and to many perylles more
than woman is ordeyned to. ¶Diues.
I haue wondre that ony clerke
ſholde holde ayenſt the in this mater
of Adams ſynne. ¶Pauper.
Clerkes ſpeke oft by opynyon in this

¶Pauper. Full many. For ſomtyme

In epla ad Macedoniū. Alſo withholdynge

For the couetous ryche men withdrawe

And therfore the wyſe man ſayth.
Sone defraude thou not the almeſſe

Tourment thou not the herte of

the good none occaſyon to curſe the

yelde thy dette & anſwere peaſable

¶Diues. By the lawe of kynde

And therfore ſayth the lawe .xij

               DIues. Sythen all thynge is

lawe of kynde / how may ony

                     〈◊〉
                   be lord of ony thyng more than
an other man. ¶Pauper. There is
lordſhyp of kynde / & there is lordſhyp
of this worlde groūded only in coueſe
/ & there is lordſhyp of dyſpenſacōn
& of gouernaūce / & ſo Ioſeph the ſone
of Iacob was called lorde of Egypt.
Gen̄ .xlv. The fyrſte lordſhyp is comon
to euery good man & woman.
For kynde made all men euen in lordſhyp.
And in token therof / both lorde
& ſeruaūt / free & boūde / ryche & poore
come in to this worlde naked & poore
and go hens naked & poore. Nought
they brynge wt them but wepyng ſob
bynge & ſorowe. And bere no thynge
wt them but ther good dedes or wycked.
The lordſhyp of this worlde is
ſuffrable & worſhypfull. For as ſaynt
Poule ſayth. Omnis poteſtas a deo ē
Euery power & lordſhyp in this worlde
cometh of god. And therfore he
byddeth that euery man and woman
ſholde be ſuget & meke to y• lordſhyp
aboue them. For though the couetyſe
and wyckedneſſe that lordes & ryche
men groūde theym in be of themſelfe
yet the lordſhyp & power is of goddes
gyfte. As ſaynt Auſten ſayth / & therfore
it muſte be worſhypped. The
lordſhyp that is only of dyſpenſacōn
cōmytted by a ſouerayne is medefull
worſhypfull & cōmendable. Alſo ther
is thre maner of propertees and properhede
One is that kynde gyueth / as
man to lye. And euery man hath
his owne herte / his owne ſoule / & his
owne wyll for to do well or euyll / and
this properte is nedeful. An other properte
ther is / yt cometh only of couetyſe
/ by whiche couetyſe folke ſaye / this
is myne & this is thyne. And ſo they
propren to themſelfe by couetyſe yt is
comon by kynde. And this propertee
ſo groūded in couetyſe is dampnable
& ſynfull. The thyrde is dyſpenſacōn
For one man hath moche thynge in
his dyſpenſacyon and gouernaunce / that
an other man hath nought to do
of. And this dyſpenſacōn cometh ſome
tyme of goddes gyfte / as whan
he ſente one man more ryches in this
worlde than an other. Somtyme it
cometh by ordynaūce & gyfte of lordes
& of ſoueraynes here in erthe. As
whan lordes and prelates cōmytte to
ther ſuget
                     •
                   gouernaūce of ther goodes
of ther places & benefyces. And
this dyſpenſacōn yf it be well do it is
full medeful. ¶Diues. But as ſaynt
Poule ſayth. It is a queſtyon who is
foūde trewe amonge ſuche dyſpenſours.
For nygh al ſeke ther owne profyte
/ but not the worſhyp of Iheſu cryſte.
¶Pauper. Many be full falſe / &
yet ſythen dyſpenſacyon of worldely
goodes is ſo cōmytted to theym / in yt
they haue lorſhyp of ther propre dyſpenſacōn
ordeyned of god / & be called
propre lordes of ther ꝓpre dyſpenſacyon / not for ther falſe couetyſe / ne
for no properhede yt they chalenge by
falſe couetyſe. For in that be they no
lordes but tyraūtes and rauynours.
And ſo though they haue propre lordſhyp
of dyſpenſacōn of worldely goodes
more than the poore people / they

haue yet nomore lordſhyp by waye of
kynde than the poore man / ne non other
lordſhyp than the poore man / but
only of dyſpenſacōn. And ſo though
the ryche folke haue more lordſhyp of
propre dyſpenſacyon than the poore / yet
the lordſhyp of kynde in nedefull
thynges ſtandeth ſtyll comon to ryche
and poore. But for ſynne it is not ſo
fre as it was byfor y• ſynne of Adam
For god wyl not yt the poore folke take
ony thynge without leue of the propre
dyſpenſatour yt is called lorde therof
/ & therfore god ſayd. Non furtū facies
Thou ſhalt do no theeft / yt is to
ſaye / yu ſhalt nought take without thy
lordes leue. ¶Diues. This is wonderfull
to me yt the poore man is as
grete a lorde by waye of kynde as the
ryche / & yet may he nought take with
out his leue. ¶Pauper. It is more
wonder yt the good poore man is lorde
of all thynge nedefull to hym by
waye of kynde / & yt ſynfull ryche man
is lorde of ryght nought by waye of
kynde / for he is goddes traytour. And
yet god wyll yt the poore take ryght
nought of the good yt the ryche man
hath in his dyſpenſacōn without leue
¶Diues. That is to me more wondful
/ tell me how this may be ¶Pauꝑ
Thou myght ſee at eye yt the kynges
heyre aparant & other heyres of grete
lordſhyppes / not withſtandynge that
they be heyres & lordes of al / yet ſhal
they not entre the offyce of ther offycers
/ ne take ony thynge ayenſt / ne bere
ayenſt without leue. And yf they do
they ſhall be harde vndernomen / & in

For fredom in youth is cauſe of
pryde & of many other vyces. Ryght
ſo god ſeynge yt mankynde whiche is
lorde of all erthly goodes & ordeyned
to regne in heuen blyſſe. Yf he hadde
his fredom in vſe of erthely thynges
he ſholde falle in pryde & many vyces

Therfore he hath put mankynde &
namely the poore people vnder yt gouernaūce
of the ryche folke / & of ther
lordes whiche be ther tutours & dyſpenſatours
of goodes of this worlde

I ſuppoſe that the huſbonde forbede his wyfe vtterly to do almeſſe of

¶Pauper. In yt nede ſhe is boūde to
gyue & ſhall gyue / & thynke yt hyr huſbonde
ſawe that nede he ſholde not be
myſpayed. We rede in the fyrſte boke
of kynges .xxvi. ca. That ther was a
grete nygard & an angry ſhrewe whoſe
name was Naball. He had a good
woman wyſe & fayre to his wyf whoſe
name was Abygaell. That tyme
Dauyd fled the perſecucōn of kynge
Saul / & lyued in deſerte with .vi. hondred
men wt hym as outlawes. And
for myſcheef he ſent .x. men to this ryche
Naball praynge hym of ſome almeſſe
in mete & drynke. But this Naball
deſpyſed Dauyd & his meſſangeres
& called them theues & outlawes
& flemyd men / & wolde no good gyue
hem / notwithſtandynge yt they had ſaued
his good & his beſtes all y• tyme
that they were in deſerte. Whan Dauyd
herde theſe tydynges he was wrothe
/ & came with .iiij. hondred men to
ſlee Naball & all that longed to hym
It happened yt a ſeruaūt of Naball
tolde his wyfe Abygaell how Dauyd
had ſent meſſangers to Naball / and
how he had deſpyſed theym. Anone
Abygaell without wyttynge of Naball
charged aſſes with brede & wyne
with ſoden fleſſhe of fyue ſhepe / fygges
and reyſens & other vytales grete
plente & ſent to Dauyd by hyr ſeruau
tes
/ and ſhe folowed after & happened
to mete Dauyd in his comynge
Than Dauyd repreued hyr huſbonde
Naball of his vnkyndeneſſe / &
ſayd he ſholde ſlee hym and all that
longd to hym. Than yt good woman
Abygaell felle downe to groūde and
worſhypped Dauyd and prayed hym
of audyence. Than ſhe axed mercy
for hyr huſbonde Naball and excuſed
hyrſelfe that ſhe wyſte not of his meſſangers
whan they were there & prayde
Dauyd that he ſholde not ſo venge
hymſelfe and taught hym moche
goodneſſe / & prophecyed to hym moche
welth & prayed hym that he wolde
accepte hyr preſaunt / & ſo he dyde.
Than Dauyd ſayd to hyr. Bleſſyd
be our lorde god yt ſent the this daye
to me / & bleſſyd be thy ſpeche & bleſſyd
be yu that this daye haſte letted me
fro ſheddynge of blood to venge myſelfe.
And than Dauyd tourned ayen
in to deſerte / & ſhe came home ayen
& foūde hyr huſbonde Naball at ſouper
ſolemply. But that nyght ſhe ſpake
nought to hym of that mater for
he was full dronken. But in the morowe
whan he was ſobre ſhe tolde hȳ
what ſhe had do to ſaue his lyf. And
anone his herte dyed for ſorowe / and
he wexe heuy as a ſtone / & within ten
dayes he dyed a wycked deth / & than
Dauyd wedded his wyfe Abygaell.
Alſo yf man or woman ſtele awaye
mannes ſwerde whan he is wood to
lette hym of manſlaughter of hymſelfe
or of other / he doth no theeft ne
ſynne. Alſo by cauſe of ryghtwyſnes
man may take awaye other mennes
goodes ayenſt ther wyll / as in ryghtful
batayle / ſo that they yt fyght ryght
fully ayenſt the vnryghtful take ther
goodes not for couetyſe / but for ryghtfulne
s;ſe
to ſhewe yt they haue occupyed
tho goodes wrongfully. But yf

they talke ther goodes for euyll couetyſe
they do rauayne though the dede
be ryghtfull in themſelfe.

And therfore he ſhall do men to

by auctoryte of a wyſe confeſſour kepe

praye for hym that ought it / or ellys
gyue it to other nedy that they maye
praye for hym yt ought it & ſoo make
reſtytucōn. Therfore ſayth ſaynt Auſten
in Omelia. Yf yu haſte foūde ony
thynge & not made reſtytucōn / that
thynge yu haſt ſtolen. For he ſayth / god
taketh more hede to the herte than to
the honde. And therfor theeft is done
in a ſmale thynge as well as in a grete
For god charged not the thynge yt
is ſtolen / but the wycked wyll of the
ſteler / as ſaynt Auſten ſayth & ſaynt
Gregory. And therfore yf childern in
ther youth ſtele pynnes or apples or
ony other ſmale thynges / anone as it
is perceyued they ſholde be harde chaſty

ſayth. Principijs obſta. With
ſtande the begynnynge of vyces & of
mycherye. For whan childern in yonge
begynnen to haue lykynge in mycherye
/ though the thynge be ſmall in

the ſynne of them that ſuffre theym
Therfore it is goddes dome yt whan
they be not chaſtyſed in ther youthe
for ſuche mycherye / afterwarde they
ſtele gretter thynges & be hanged to
ſhame & ſhenſhyp of all ther kynne.
And therfore as Boecius de diſciplina
ſcolariū telleth. Whan a mannes
ſone of Rome ſholde be hanged / he
prayed his fader to kyſſe hym / & he
bote of his faders noſe ſaynge to him
Thynke well fader on this token &
chaſtyſe better thy childern / for haddeſte

I ſholde not haue be hanged. Therfore
the wyſe man ſayth. Qui parcit
virge odit filiū ſuū &c̄. He that ſpareth
the yerde hateth his ſone. And
he loueth his ſone that chaſtyſeth hȳ

We rede that on a tyme a poore man
was tempted to ete goos fleſſhe / but
he durſte not ſtele for drede of hangynge.
On a daye he mette with the
fende & he bad hym ſtele a goos & ete

after he ſtale an oxe & was take &

to the fende / woo worth the wycked

not / for thou myghteſt ſee by the byll
that it was no goos.

¶Pauper. He doth theefth. For it is

And yf lord or lady / or ony other man

thynge to kepe / & he take it away fro
hym without his wetynge for falſe couety
s;e
or for malyce to endaūgere the

thynge be his owne / yet it is not frely
his owne as longe as the ſeruaūt by

vnlefully wenynge yt it were lefull ſo

in caſe he do vnlefully / yet in this caſe
he doth no theft ne dedely ſynne / &
yet he is boūde to reſtytucōn. Theeft
encludeth alwaye gyle & falſenes wt

tho he wyſte it than doth he no
theft ne ſynne / & yf he take an other

¶Diues. And what yf a man

without aſſent of hym / whiche good
he lent him to his vſe. ¶Pauper. He
doth theft / but he haue Iuſte cauſe to
wene yt the lorde of yt thynge ſhal not

an other mānes good ayenſt his wyl
for lucre & wynnynge of frendſhyp.
And yf a man lene an other ony thynge
vpon a wed / and he vſed that wed

without leue of hym that ought it / he
doth theeft / but it be for ſaluacōn of
the thyng. For yf he vſe it for ſparyng
of his owne good for lucre or for fals

doth theft as ſayth y• ſame clerke. Yf
a thyng ſtolen peryſſhe / though y• thefe

both of yt thynge & of y• profyte yt

that he profred it to hym / but for the

thynge he is boūde not only by reſtytucōn
of yt thynge / but alſo of the value
of the vſe. ¶Diues. Yf a man or
woman bye in open market a thynge

/ whan he knoweth the ſothe / may
he axe the pryce of yt thynge of hym
that ought it or withdrawe it tyll he

therfore. ¶Pauꝑ. Reymūde & other
clerkes ſaye nay. And therfor beware
an other tyme / both for loſſe of his &
alſo for ſuſpeccōn of theft / for lyghtly
for beggȳg of ſtolen thyng he myght
be take as a theef. Netheleſſe he may
ryghtfully axe his payment of hym
that ſolde it to hym whan he hath reſtored
it to the lorde of yt thynge / & yf
he ſpent ony thynge in amendement
of yt thyng whyle it was in his kepynge
/ he may with good fayth axe that
of hym that ought the thynge without
reſtorynge of the profyte yt he had
of yt thynge byfore he wyſt that it was
ſtolen. But whan he knoweth yt it is
ſtolen & other mennes / & he kepeth it
ſtylle for couetyſe or ony other vnleful
cauſe / he is boūde to reſtytucōn fro yt
tyme as longe as he kepeth it of the
profyte to the lorde. Yf the thynge pery
s;ſhe
whyle he kepe it not knowyng
yt it was ſtolen by good fayth / he is
boūde to reſtytucōn. And yf he ſolde
it awaye or gaue it or he knowe of y•
ſtelynge he is not boūde to reſtytucōn
of y• thynge / but of y• profyte yf he be
amended therby / & this is good lawe
of conſcyence. Yf a man ſtele of a ryche

¶Diues. It is harde to knowe what
is y• ryght value of a thynge. ¶Pauper
The ryght value & the Iulte pryſe
of a thynge is after that the comon

is as moche worth as it may be ſolde
by comon market. Tanti valet

rycheſſes of this worlde rycheſſes of
wyckedneſſe. ¶Pauper. For they
ben to moche fo
                     •
                  ke occaſyon of moche
wyckedneſſe / & moche dyſeaſe of
hate / wrath / enuye / of debate of plee
& of grete dyſcenſyon. And it is full
harde to gete them or to kepe them
without ſynne & grete dyſeaſe. And
therfore ſaynt Poule ſayth that they
that coueyte to be ryche in this worlde
/ falle in the fendes ſnare. And the
wyſe man ſayth. Yf thou be ryche in
this worlde / y• ſhalt not be vngylty ne
clene from ſynne. Alſo leue frende ye
ſhall vnderſtande that wyckedneſſe
in holy wrytte is taken not only for
ſynne / but alſo for payne & dyſeaſe &
myſcheues of this worlde. And ſoo
goodes of this worlde ben called rycheſſes
of wyckedneſſe / that is to ſay
of payne & dyſeaſe and of myſcheef.
For they brynge men in to payne trauayle
& moche dyſeaſe / for men haue
moche trauayle in gettynge / moche
drede in kepynge / & moche ſorowe in
the leſynge. Diues diuicias nō ogregat

                   dolore. They behote
ſykerneſſe & brynge folke in to
grete peryll / grete drede / and in grete
enmyte. They behote a man to haue
his luſte & lykynge & brynge hym in
endeleſſe hongre. For as Salomon
ſayth. The couetous man hath neuer

                     ur
                   pecunia.
But alwaye coueyteth more & more.
Alſo they byhote a man eaſe & reſte &

brynge hym in moche trauaylle / for
nyghe all the trauayle of this worlde
is to gete good. An other cauſe ther is
why they ben called rycheſſes of wyckedneſſe.
For the lawe ſayth.x.q̄.i. dilectiſſimis.
By waye of kynde al men
ben euen in lordſhyppes & rycheſſes / but
by wyckedneſſe of falſe couetyſe
in the people men ben vneuen in rycheſſe.
For ſome haue moche / ſome lytyll
/ ſome ben ryche ſome ben poore / &
god hath gyuen more rycheſſe to one
man in dyſpenſacōn & gouernaunce / than
to many other. And that is to refrayne
the wyckedneſſe of falſe couety
s;e
in the people. And for wyckednes
is cauſe that one man is rycher than
an other / therfore they be called rycheſſes
of wyckedneſſe. For ne hadde be
the wyckedneſſe of Adams ſynne / &
of falſe couetyſe of mannes herte / els
all men ſholde haue ben euen ryche.
But now they ben vneuen in rycheſſe
for ſynne and ſhrewedneſſe. And
therfore goodes of this worlde ben
called rycheſſes of vneueneſſe and of
wyckedneſſe. Iniquitatis .i. nō equitatis.
And therfore all the rycheſſes
that one man hath paſſynge another
it is rycheſſes of vneueneſſe. For in
that he is vneuen with his euen cryſten
/ therfore they ben called rycheſſes
of vneueneſſe. Therfore god byddeth
the ryche men that ben but his
bayllyes and his reues in this worlde
make frendes of the poore folke / both
by gyuynge and forgyuynge / as
that bayllye dyd / and be not to harde
to theyr ſugettes / but mercyable and
forgyue hem theyr dettes whiche they
ought to god & to them. For god is ſo
grete a lorde & ſo ryche that ther may
no man do hym fraude of his good / ne
hyndre ne leſe his lordſhyppe.

               DIues. In the fyfth cōmaū
                  dement
thou ſaydeſt that ryche
men y• wyll not helpe the
poore folke be manſleers. Here thou

that that they do ayenſt both cōmaū
                  dementes.
¶Pauper. In y• the poore

ryche man is a manſleer & doth ayenſte

ſhalt do no theeft. For all y• the ryche
man hath paſſynge his nedefull lyuynge
after the aſtate of his dyſpenſacōn
/ it is the poore mānes. And therfore
ſayth ſaynt Ambroſe / y• it is noo
leſſe ſynne to the ryche man for to denye
y• poore man helpe at nede whan
he may helpe hym of his habondaū
                  ce
/ than it is to robbe a man of his

yt yu ſhetteſt vp in ſuperfluyte
is the poore wedowes. And the moneye
yt yu hydeſt in the erthe in waſte
is the raunſome of the pryſoners and
of myſcheuous folke for to delyuere
them out of pryſon and out of boundes
/ and helpe them out of woo. And

therfore ſayth he / wytte thou it well / that
of as many goodes yu art theef &
rauenour as thou myghteſt gyue to
helpe of the poore folke yf thou gyue
them not. Noo man ſholde ſaye ony

¶Diues. I aſſent well to thy wordes
that ryche men ſholde gyue almeſſe
of theyr habondaūce ſauynge
the aſtate of theyr dyſpenſacōn / and
that is full harde to doo. For moche
thynge is nedefull to the ryche man
more than to the poore bycauſe of his
aſtate of dyſpenſacōn. For mo thynges
ben nedefull to a kynge than to
an erle / and mo to an erle than to a
ſymple knyght / and ſoo it is of other
aſtates. To kynges prynces and lordes
is nedefull to haue treaſoure to
wage men of armes in defence of
the Realme / and to wage theyr offycers
in gouernaunce of the Realme
and of ther lordſhyppe. And therfore
an Emperour ſayd. Qui omni

omnibus indiget. He that is lorde
by dyſpenſacyon of all thynge in
this worlde / hath nede of all thynge.
And ſoo the more lordſhyppe in this
worlde / the more nede. ¶Pauper.
Therfor of ſuche thynges ſo nedeful
to man after the aſtate of his dyſpenſacōn
/ he is not boūde to gyue the poore
but in grete nede. But of other ſuperfluyte
that is not nedefull to hym
in that degre / he is boūde to gyue / for
alwaye y• comon profyte ought to be
charged more / than the profyte of one
perſone. ¶Diues. It ſemeth by thy
wordes that men of holy chirche whiche
ſpende the goodes of holy thirche
in wycked vſe / as in pompe / pryde / glotonye
/ lecherye
/ & in other vanytees be
theues / for they witholde poore mennes
good and ſpende it in myſuſe ayenſt
the wyll of god & of poore folke
¶Pauper. That is ſoth. For ſaynt
Ierom ſayth / that all yt clercles haue
of holy chirche goodes / it is the poore
mennes / & for helpe of the poore folke
prȳcypaly holy chirche is endowed
To them that haue the benefyces &
the goodes of holy chirche / it longeth
pryncypally to gyue almeſſe & to haue
cure of the poore people. Therfore
ſaynt Bernarde in Epyſtola ad Eugeniu
ſayth thus. The naked cry / &
the hongrye playne them & ſaye the
byſſhoppes what doth golde in your
brydels / it may not put a waye coldene
hongre fro the brydell. It is our yt
ye ſo ſpende in pompe & vanytee / ye
take it from vs cruelly and ſpende it
vaynely. And in an other pyſtle that
he wrote to a chanon he ſayd thus.
Yf thou ſerue wel goddes aulter it is
graūted to the to lyue by the aulter / not
to bye theyr brydelles ſyluered or
ouergylt. For what thou kepeſte for
thy ſelfe of the aulter paſſynge thyn
honeſte nedefull lyuynge / it is raueyn
it is theeft / it is ſacrylege. Therfore
theſe men of holy chirche that boode
ther ſhone with boocles of ſyluer and
vſe grete ſyluer harneys in theyr gytdelles
& knyues / and men of relygyon
monkes and chanones and ſuche other
that vſe grete ouches of ſyluer &
golde on theyr copes to faſtene theyr
hodes ayenſt the wynde / and ryde on
hyghe horſes with ſadels harneyſed

with golde & ſyluer more pompouſly
than lordes / be ſtronge theues and do
grete ſacrylege ſo ſpendynge the goodes
of holy chirche in vanyte & pryde
in luſte of the fleſſhe / by whiche good
the poore folke ſholde lyue. A lady of
a thouſande marke by yere can pynne
her hode ayenſt the wynde wt a ſmale
pynne of laton .xij. for a peny.
But a monke that is bounden to pouerte
by his profeſſyon wyll haue anouche
/ or a broche of golde and ſyluer
in value of a noble or moche more.
¶Diues. Be not ſuche men of holy
chirche ſoo myſpendynge the poore
mennes goodes bounde to reſtytucōn.
¶Pauper. Yf they haue wherof to
make reſtytucyon / they ben bounden
to reſtytucyon / as ſayth Dockynge
ſuper Deutro.v.ca. Quia non dimit
titur peccatum donec reſtituatur ablatum.
And therfore ſaynt Auſten in
epiſtola ad Macedonium ſayth thus.
Yf an other mannes good be not yolden
ayen whan it may be yolden / he
that ſtale it doth noo verry penaunce / but
he fayneth penaunce. For yf he
do verry penaunce he muſte do reſtytucyon
to his power. ¶Diues. And
what ſayeſt thou of tho clerkes that
ſpende holy chirche goodes on theyr
kynneſmen & wymen / and other ryche
folke for to be mayntened / & for
to haue a name & for to be worſhypped
in this worlde. ¶Pauꝑ. Yf they
gyue theyr kynneſmen & theyr frendes
to releue theym of theyr nede / it
is well done and the ordre of charyte
axeth it. But yf they gyue the goodes
of holy chirche to make theym ryche
and grete in this worlde of the poore
mennes good / it is raueyne theeft and
ſacrylege. Alſo to gyue ryche folke
meſurably to mayntene them ryghtfully
in holy chirche / it is well done.
But to gyue them holy chirche goodes
to be worſhypped & to haue a name
of pompe it is euyll done / and it
is ſacrylege & theeft ſo to ſpende the
goodes of holy chirche yt ben the poore
mēnes goodes. ¶Diues. What ſayſte
yu of theym that ſpende the goodes of
holy chirche in theyr owne nedefull
vſe / and doo not theyr duyte ne ſerue
not therfore. ¶Pauper. The ſame
clerke Dockynge in the ſame place
ſayth that they ben theues. For the
goodes of holy chirche & the benefyces
ben gyuen to them that they ſholde
trauayle and ſerue holy chirche in
techynge prechynge and ſacramentes
gyuynge / and in beſy gouernaunce.
And but they do ſo / they be not worthy
to haue benefyces of holy chirche
ne to lyue by holy chirche goodes And
therfore ſaynt Poule ſayth. Qui non
laborat / non manducet. He that trauayleth
not / ſholde not etc. And yf yt
they take holy chirche goodes and trauayll
not therfore as they ben bounden
they ben theues. For yf a labourer
toke moneye to trauayll in the felde
& he trauayled not therfore / but he
yaue it ayen / he ſholde be holden a
theef. And therfore ſaynt Poule ſayd
Qui epiſcopatum deſiderat. bonum
opus deſiderat. He that deſyreth a byſſhopryche
/ he deſyreth a good werke.
Prima ad Thimoth .iij. For as the
gloſe ſayth / in that that he deſyreth

a byſſhopryche / he deſyreth a werke / not
a dygnyte. He deſyreth trauayll / not
eaſe & reſte / not to wexe in to pryde
/ but for to come from pryde to more
loweneſſe / to be ſeruaunt and mynyſter
to all his ſubgettes of whiche
he hath cure / or ellys they be not worthy
to lyue by the goodes of holy chirche
For the benefyces of holy chirche
be not gyuen them for to goo playe
theym / but for to trauayl about theyr
cure. ¶Diues. They haue theyr vykers
and theyr paryſſhe preſtes vnder
theym. ¶Pauper. The vyker and
the paryſſhe preeſt ſhall anſwere for
that that they reſceyue / and the perſone
for that yt he reſceyueth. And he
that more reſceyueth more is bounde.
And the benefyces of holy chirche be
not gyuen to clerkes that they ſholde
betake to other men the cure. But for
they ſholde haue pryncypal cure them
ſelfe. For ellys the lewde man and
woman myght haue the benefyces
of holy chirche / as the ſame clerke
ſayth. And he ſayth that perſones
whiche abſent themſelf fro theyr chirches
onely for eaſe or for couetyſe / or
for luſte of theyr fleſſhe / & ſo ſpende
the goodes of holy chirche / they ben
theues. Natheleſſe as he ſayth they
may abſent them from ther chirches
for a tyme by leue of theyr ſoueraynes
that may gyue them leue for ſome
good cauſe / as for lernynge or for
helpe of theyr chirches. Alſo they yt
reſceyue the benefyces of holy chirche
& be vnable in that tyme whan
they reſceyue them to ſerue holy chirche
/ or to haue cure of that benefyce / they
ben theues. But whan they falle
in age and in febleneſſe after yt they
haue truly trauayled / or after that the
benefyce is gyuen them they may lefully
lyue by theyr benefyces / but yf
they haue ſuffycyent patrymonye to
be ſuſteyned with. Alſo they that appropre
to them goodes of holy chirche
be theues & do ſacrylege as ſayth the
ſame clerke Dockynge in the ſame
place. For clerkes in theyr bgynnynge
ſaye. Dn̄s pars hereditatis mee.
Our lorde god is parte of myne herytage
For as ſaynt Ierom ſayth ad
Nepocianū. He muſt be parte of god
& haue god to his parte / and ſo haue
hym in his lyuynge / that he haue god
with hym & that god haue hym. And
ſythen he ſayth god is my parte / he
ought no thynge to haue but our lord
god. And yf he haue golde ſyluer poſſeſſyons
& ſuche other rycheſſes / our

And therfore he byddeth there yt euery

Quia cleros greci dr ſors latine. For

yf he kepte them ſtylle or payed them

ſholde not be gyuen but to them that
it longeth to by the cōmaundement

of god they longe not to ſuche wycked
lyuers / therfore they ſholde not
be gyuen to them. Alſo thoughe the

lewde man withholde his tythes and
his duetees fro ſuche wycked men in
holy chirche and paye them to his ſorayne
/ or ellys kepeth them ſtylle for

And all that ſo come in to the benefyces

is ſymonye. ¶Pauper. Symonye is
a ſtudyous couetyſe & wyll to bye or

as the phyloſophre ſayth / not only he

that ſome thynges be forboden
for they be ſymonyent / as byenge and
ſellynge of the ſacramentes of holy
chirche / in whiche wyll allone without

Some thynges ben ſymonyent
only for they ben forboden by holy

ſuche wyll without dede maketh not

he is gylty byfore god. And yf he reſygne

he doth no ſymonye. ¶Diues

ſaynt Peter forſoke his moneye and
ſayd to hym. Thy moneye be ſtylle

And therfore all that bye ony thyng
ſpirytuel or ony thynge knytte to ſpyrytuell

And they that ſelle it ben
called Giezites. Giezite in latyn for
Giezi the ſeruaūt of Helyzee the prophete
toke mede of the grete lord Naman
for that god had made hym hole
of his lepre by the prophete Helyzee
that was his mayſter. And ſo he ſelde
falſely the gyfte of god in as moche

god & of the prophete Helyzee. And
therfore he was lepre & all his kynne

¶Diues. In how many maners is

maners as thynge ſpirytuel is boughte
& ſolde by thre maner gyftes. For
ſomtyme it is bought by gyft of honde

gyuē not in due maner ne ryghtfully
to haue a thynge ſpirytuel / gyft

of holy ordre is do ſymonye
ſomtyme only on his ſyde yt maketh

yt ſhall be ordred gyueth y• byſſhop ſome
gyft without the wetynge of him

only on his ſyde yt ſhall be ordred / as
yf he gyue ony gyftes to ony of y• byſſhopes
offycers to ſpeke for hym yt he
may be ordred / & of whiche gyfte the

done of both the partes / as whan the

Yf a preeſt wyll not baptyſe

gyue theyr good frely to men of holy

ſholde take it frely by waye of almes
And the gyuer with his gyfte of charyte
may axe certayn prayers of them
that he gyueth to / & yf they graūted

that the apoſtles toke frely theyr lyuynge

And thus muſte all men of holy chirche
take theyr lyuynge yf they wyl be

not ſelle ther offyce yt they do in holy

And ſoo in caſe he ſholde happen

it is to haue four ſcore maſſes ſonge
to gydre daye by daye for .xx. ſhellynges

For why / ye may for .xx. ſhellynges do
ſynge a quarter of an annuell & doo

gyue a thouſande poūde for a maſſe / the
preeſt may not appropre y• maſſe

after that he is boūden / and he muſte
put his prayer in the wyll of god & in

a poore man that no preeſt
thynketh on in ſpecyall / that dyed in
more charyte than he that the preeſt
prayeth fore in ſpecyall / ſhall rather
be holpen by the maſſe of the preeſt / than
he for whom he prayeth in ſpecyal
Moreouer leue frende vnderſtande
that prayer is a grete gracyous
gyfte of god. For as the clerkes ſaye / holy
prayer is a ſtyenge vp of manes
& womannes herte to god. Oracio eſt
aſcenſus mentis in deum. And that
may noo man haue without ſpecyall
gyfte of god. For cryſte ſayth in the
goſpell / that there cometh no man to
hym / but the fader of heuen drawe
hym by Inwarde gooſtely mocyon yt
is Inwarde deuocyon. And without
this Inwarde deuocyon the prayer of
mouth is ryght nought worth. And
therfore it is good ſome tyme to gyue
almeſſe to a good preeſt whiche hath
nede of almeſſe to meue hym to pray
for you that ye may haue the grace
of god & ſwetneſſe in him by y• prayer
of the preeſt & your almeſſe. Natheles

Ne ye ſhal not gyue hym almeſſe

alwaye the preeſt muſte be more free

And ſo ſpyrytuel vſurye
is called multiplycacōn of the gyftes

¶Pauper. For the vſurer ſelleth togydre
the thynge yt he leneth & the vſe

of ye ſellynge of ye vſe. The vſurer
ſelleth the thynge yt he leneth in yt
that he taketh more ouer for the vſe

vnderſtande that many thynges ther
be that may not be vſed without waſte

ſuche the vſe maye not be departed

graunteth the thynge graunteth the
vſe of the thynge / & they may not be

yf the ſeller take for the vſe he ſelleth
that thynge twyes / and ſelleth thynge
that nought is. For the vſe of that
thynge is full waſte therof / & for ſuche
ſellynge of the vſe it is called vſurye
For the vſurer ſelleth the thynge
in it ſelfe & the vſe ouer. Some thynges
there be in whiche the vſe is not
full deſtruccyon of the thynge / as vſe
of an houſe is the dwellynge or occupacōn
therof / & in ſuche the lordſhyp
of the thynge may be graūted without

ye vſe of moneye is chaūgynge of one

In that he that chaūgeth it for

therfore it is vnlefull for to take ony
thynge for the vſe that ought to be comon
to all as it is ordeyned to helpe

that the lener take ayen the euen value

ſaynt Auſten and ſaynt Thomas
de veritate theologie libro quinto.
God forbyddeth all maner leſynges

Qui tacet conſentire videtur. He that

And therfore ſayth ſaynt Auſten that
bothe he that hydeth the treuth & he
y• lyeth ayenſt the treuth ben gylty ayenſt
this cōmaūdement. For why he
that is ſtylle wyll not proufyte to his

to harme his euen cryſten. In epla ad
Caſulanū. For man and woman is
boūden by this cōmaūdement not to

And therfore Iohn Cryſoſtome ſayth
that not only he is a traytour to the

tho that by ſtylleneſſe enforce theym
not to knowe the treuthe yt they knowe

Natheleſſe leue frende ye ſhall vnderſtande

One is anentes god / an other anentes

The ſeconde is wycked whan we

The thyrde is wycked in .ij. maners

putteth .vij. maner of leſynges whiche
ben comprehended in thre. Quia
ōne mendaciū. vel ē ꝑnicioſū. vel officio
s;ū.
vel iocoſū. For euery leſynge or
it is ſuche y• it doth harme / & than it
is called in latyne ꝑnicioſū / that is to
ſaye wycked in Englyſſhe. Or it is
ſuche that it doth good & none harme
/ & that is called in latyn officioſū
that is profytable in Englyſſhe. Or
it is ſuche y• it dooth neyther good ne
harme / & that is called in latyn 
                     •
                  ocoſum
/ that is bourdfull in Englyſſhe / as
whan men make leſynges only to
make folke mery. The fyrſte maner
that is called ꝑnicioſū and wycked is
alwaye dedely ſynne. But the two other
maner of leſynges ben venyall
ſynne to the comon people. But to
men of holy chirche & to relygyouſe
and to all that ſholde be folke of perfeccōn
they ben dedely ſynne yf they
ben done by auyſement or by cuſtome
as ſaynt Auſten ſayth. The fyrſt maner
of leſynges is done in fyue maners.
Fyrſte yf ony man ſaye preche
or teche ony thynge ayenſt ye fayth of
holy chirche / the .ij. is whan the leſynge
harmeth ſome & profyteth to none
as leſynges of bacbytynge & fals wytne
s;ſe
of ſynne y• comon lawe punyſſhed
/ the .iij. is y• ſo profyteth to one &
harmeth to an other / as fals wytneſſe
in cauſe of dette or of herytage / or of
ſuche other / the .iiij. is whan the leſynge
is made without profyt & without
cauſe / ſaue only for lykynge to lye &
to deſceyue & for cuſtome of leſynges
the .v. is whan the leſynge is made
only for to pleaſe / as flaterynge. Alle
theſe maner of leſynges ben forboden
by this cōmaundement to all mener
folke as dedely ſynne. The leſynge
of flaterynge maye be done in thre
maners / in prayſynge a man in thynge
that he hath more than he is worthy
to be prayſed / or prayſyng hym in
a thynge y• he hath not / or prayſynge

hym & flaterynge hȳ in his ſynne &
ſhrewedneſſe & in his folye. And this
maner of flateryng yf it be done wyttyngly
it is dedely ſynne. The ſecōde
maner of leſynge y• is called Officio
ſū & profytable / it is done in .iij. maners.
Fyrſte for ſaluacōn of catel that
ſholde ellys be loſte wyckedly by theues
yf they wyſte where it were. Alſo
for ſaluacōn of man or of woman in
nocent that is ſought of his enemyes
Alſo to ſaue man or womā fro ſynne
as yf a ſyngle woman ſaye y• ſhe is
a wyfe / to kepe her clene from theym
that wolde defoule her. Suche maner
of leſynges that ſo auayle & profyte / &
alſo leſynges bourdfull ben venyal
ſynnes to ye comon people / but to men
of perfeccōn they ben dedly ſynne / namely
leſynges bourdfully whan they
ben in cuſtomable vſe. For it falleth
not to men of holy chirche & of relygyon
to be Iapers ne lyers / but it falleth
to them pryncypally to flee ydell
wordes. For cryſte ſayth in the goſpel
that men ſhall gyue anſwere at y• do
me for euery ydell worde y• they ſaye
But ſuche leſynges bourdful in men
of perfeccōn tourne lyghtly to leſynges
ꝑnycyous & wycked. For they do
harme to theym y• here them / in yt yt
they be aſclaūdred of theyr vanyte &
of theyr leſynges. For them thynketh
& ſoth it is that men of holy chirche
& of perfeccyon ſholde not be Iapers
ne lyers ne vayne / but ſadde in chere
in worde & dede. Therfore the mayſter
of ſentence li .iij. diſtinct .xxxviij.

ben venyal ſynnes to them that be of

that be of perfyte ſtate. And ſaynt Auſtyn

But faynyng as ſaynt Auſten ſayth

¶Pauper It ſemed to theyr ſyght

not be to ſharpe / but alwaye medled

ſayd. Bt of good conforte and take
me thy rynge and I ſhall gyue to the
the vyneyerde. Than ſhe wrote lettres
in the kynges name to the pryncypales
of the cyte vnder the kynges

For nyghe all the debate in this

therfore ſayd a phyloſopher. Tolle

two wordes myne and thyne / and

at the laſte with his ſhrewde coūſeyll

beware and take hede to thre
warnynges and tokenes that god gaue
to Balaam to flee the ſwerde. Fyrſte
his aſſe went out of his waye. After
that he hurte his fote and dyſeaſed
all his bodye. At the laſte he felle
downe vnder hym and wolde no ferther
bere hym. By the aſſe I vnderſtande
welth of this worlde that ſtandeth
pryncypaly in rycheſſes & in bodely
helth / whiche bereth a man vp in
this worlde as the aſſe bare Balaam
But beware / for ryght as the aſſe is a
full dulle beeſt / & whan a man hath
mooſt nede and mooſt haſte in his
Iourney / than he wyll not go but at
his owne luſte and ſo deſceyueth his
mayſter. Ryght ſo worldely welth deſceyueth
them that truſte therin / & fayleth
them at nede. This aſſe of worldely
welth fyrſt goth out of the waye
that is whan god ſendeth a man aduerſyte
/ and his cauſes & his trauayle
goth not forth as he wolde ne as he
wende they ſholde do / but whan he we
neth to wynne he leſeth / & ſpedeth not
as he wende to ſpede. And there he
weneth to fynde frendes / he fyndeth
enemyes. And in caas yf he wyll paſſe
the ſee the wynde is ayenſt hym &
dryueth hym out of his waye. And yf
he plete / ſome ſlyght putteth hym out
of his purpoſe / & that he wende to ſpede
in a moneth he ſhall not ſpede in
a yere / and perauenture neuer brynge
his cauſe in to the right waye there he

wolde haue it. Whan this aſſe gothe
out of the waye / take hede to thy
waye and to thy purpoſe / and yf thy
waye and purpoſe be ayenſt the pleaſaūce

than wende ayen and ceſſe of
thyn euyll purpoſe. And yf it de not
ayenſt the pleaſaunce of god / dyſpoſe
the to pacyence and thanke god of al
and take hede what the angell ſayd
to Balaam. But the aſſe ſayd he / ne
hadde gone out of the waye I hadde
ſlayne the. For but the welthe of the
worlde wente ſome tyme oute of the
waye by aduerſyte and by ſekeneſſe / ellys
it ſholde be cauſe to moche folke
of dethe / bothe bodely and gooſtly
For yf man hadde alwaye his welthe
and his wyll in this worlde / he ſholde
gyue noo tale of god / ne of man.
The ſeconde token was that he hurte
his fote and ſo dyſeaſed his bodye / that
is whan god ſendeth man ſekeneſſe
and caſteth hym downe in his
bedde / and maketh hym ſo feble that
his feet may not bere hym / than take
thou hede to thy waye and to thy
lyfe / yf it be ought contrarye to god / and
yf it be amendeth. The thrydde
token was that y• aſſe fell downe vnder
his feet in a ſtrayt waye / and wolde
not ferther bere hym. This ſtrayt
waye & ſo narowe a paas is deth where
no man may flee. Than welth of
this worlde lykened to the aſſe falleth
downe to grounde & wyll not lenger
bere man vpon this worlde. Than
paſſeth helth & welth and all luſte of
the fleſſhe. And therfore whan thou
comeſt to the poynt / take hede to thy
waye & to thy lyfe. And yf it be contrarye
to god amende y• than for euer
as thou wylt flee goddes ſwerde. Ryche

               PAuper. Two thynges pryncypaly
ſholde abate couetyſe
of mannes herte. Vnſtableneſſe
of this worlde & drede of deth.
Fyrſt vnſtableneſſe of this worlde / for
this worlde & the welth of this worlde
is lykened to four thynges full vnſtable.
To a whele about tournynge / to
a ſhyp in the ſee ſaylynge / to a floure
that ſoone fadeth & falleth to groū
                  de
/ and to a ſhadowe that awaye paſſeth
& dwelleth but a ſtounde. Fyrſte
welth of this worlde is lykened to a
whele about tournynge / for whan the
whele goth about / that yt is byneth / anone
it is aboue / & that y• is aboue / anone
it is byneth. And that y• is on y•
one ſyde / anone it is on the other ſyde
Ryght ſo it is in the whele of fortune
of this worlde. For now a man is byneth
in his youth & in his begynnynge
In myddle age he is aboue in his
welth and in his floures. But anone
the whele tourned downe ayen to greter
age / to pouerte / to ſekeneſſe & febleneſſe
/ tyll at the laſte he falleth of
the whele & dyeth / & lyeth there as a
clotte of erthe by the walle. Therfore
in the whele of fortune is wryten this
verſe. Regnabo regno regnaui .ſū ſine
regno. Man in his youth whan he
is towarde in hope of welth / he ſayth
Regnabo. I ſhall reygne. But whan
he is in his myddel age and hath the
worlde at wyll / and ſo ſytteth about
on the whele / than he ſayth in his pryde
Regno. Now I reygne. I am all
aboue. But anone the whele tourneth
downewarde / anone cometh age / ſekeneſſe
/ febleneſſe / loſſe of catell / and
aduerſyte / than he may ſaye. Regnaui.
I haue reygned / ſomtyme I was
a man. But whan he lyeth on deynge
he may ſaye. Sum ſine regno. I
am without kyngdome. My reygne
my kyngdome / my welth is done. Alſo
in the whele of fortune / y• is in the
one ſyde / anone it is in the other ſyde
For they that ben this daye a mānes
frendes & ſtande on his ſyde to helpe
hym / the next daye they ſhall be his
enemyes & ſtande ayenſt hym wt his
aduerſarye. Of this whele ſpeketh
Dauyd. In circuitu impij ambulant
Wycked couetouſe folke go about as
a whele. Poſuiſti eos vt rotā. et ſicut
ſtipulā ante faciē venti. Lorde ſayth
he thou haſte put them as a whele &
a ſtoble byfore the face of the wynde.
For as the ſtoble whyle the wynde bloweth
wauereth & fleeth aboue in the
ayer / now hyghe / now lowe / but anone
as the wynde paſſeth it falleth adowne
to the erth & lyeth there ſtylle
Ryght ſo the proude couetouſe folke
wauere in this worlde in welth and
worſhyppe / now hygher / now lower.
And as the ſtoble & the ſtrawe in his
flyght kepeth no certayne waye / ſo kepe
they no waye of goddes lawe / tyll
at the laſte the wynde paſſeth out of

theyr bodye & they falle downe in to
ther graue / & many of them in to the
pytte of helle. Alſo this worlde is lykened
to a ſhyp in the ſee ſaylynge.
For be the ſhyp euer ſo grete of hym
ſelfe & haue the wynde with hym all
at wyll / & bere he his ſayle neuer ſoo
hyghe / & go he neuer ſoo yerne / be he
paſſed ther is no token where he went
Ryght ſo be a man neuer ſo grete in
this worlde / & haue the wynde of mē
                  nes
mouth neuer ſo wel wt hym to bere
his name / to prayſe him & to flater

/ y• no man dare quycche ayenſt him
ne do / be he deed & paſſed out of this
worlde / ſoone he is foryeten. Men ſhal
fynde no token of hym within a fewe
yeres. Vnnethes ſhall he fynde one
frende that wyl do ſynge a maſſe
for his ſoule. Goo to the chircheyerde
and yu ſhalt knowe by the bodyes the
ryche from the poore / the fayre from
the foule / the wyſe from the foles / the
free fro the boūde. But all they torne
there to erth & aſſhes / to wormes mete
to ſtenche & vnclenneſſe. All theſe grete
kynges y• were ſomtyme ſo grete of

Alexander. Iulius ceſar. Nabugodono

& all ſuche other / where ben they bycomen.
Therfore they may ſaye y• is
wryten in the boke of wyſdom. Quid
nobis ꝓfuit ſuꝑbia &
                     •
                  . What profyted
to vs our grete pryde / what halpe vs
our pompe & our grete rycheſſes. All
is paſſed awaye as a ſhadowe / & as a
ſhyp yt paſſeth the wawes of the ſee / of
whiche be it paſſed men may fynde
no token. Sap. v. Mannes lyf may
well be lykened to a ſhyp whiche is
ſtreyt & narowe at both endes / but in
the myddes it is wyde & large. Ryght
ſo is mannes lyfe / for his byrth & his
begynnynge is full ſtrayt & ful narowe.
For he cometh into this worlde naked
& poore / wepynge & walynge / vnmyghty
/ vnwytty / & nought may ne
can helpe hymſelfe / & with moche trauayle
is brought forth / tyll by lytell &
lytel he cometh to mānes age. There
the ſhyp of his lyf is ſomdele wyde &
large / for in his myddell age he hath
mooſt his myght / his wytte & his wyl
But anone the ſhyp of this lyfe draweth
to an other ſtrayt ende. Anone
cometh age / febleneſſe / ſekneſſe / aduerſyte
/ loſſe of catell / & pouerte / & at the
laſte deth maketh a full ſtrayt ende / whan
he dyeth wt bytter payne in moche
drede & moche ſorowe and gooth
hens naked & poore ryght as he cam
& bereth nought wt him but his good
dedes & wycked. Of theſe two ſtrayt
endes ſayth Iob thus. Nudus eg

                  eſſꝰ
ſnm de vtero matris mee. et nudus reuertar
illuc. Naked I cam out of my
moders wombe / & naked I ſhall tourne
ayen in to the erthe moder of all.
And yf a man wyll ſtyre well a ſhyp
or a bote / he may not ſtande in y• myddes
of the ſhyp / ne in the former ende
but he muſte ſtande in y• laſte ende / &
there he may ſtyre the ſhyp as he wyl
Ryght ſo he y• wyll ſtyre well y• ſhyp
of his lyf in this worlde / he may not
ſtande in y• myddes of his ſhyp not ſet

his thought & his herte in welth that
he hath in his myddel age / ne he ſhal
not ſtonde in y• former ende not ſet his
herte ne his thought in his byrthe ne
in his begynnynge to thynke moche
of his kynrede / ne of alyaūce to ſtyre
him to pryde. But he muſt ſtonde in ye
laſte ende of his ſhyp & of his lyfe &
thynke on his deth / and on his laſte
ende. And how myſcheuouſly & how
perylouſly he ſhall wende hens / and
how wheder ne whan wote he neuer.
And in that maner he ſhall beſte ſtyre
the ſhyp of his lyfe to the ſyker hauen
of heuen blyſſe. Therfore the wyſe
man ſayth. Memorare nouiſſimatua
et in eternū non peccabis. Thynke
Inwardly of thy laſte thynges &

all our lyuynge in this worlde is but

they houſe / than they begyn to

as a ſhadewe at euen Therfor
mannes lyfe is lykened to a ſlyder
waye. For whan a mar

                  goth by a ſlyder

Ther was ſayth cryſte ſome tyme a

y• dwelled in a lordes courte. The
one was a foole ſage / that other was
a naturell foole. It byfell on a daye

they came to gydre in to a kabehouſe
whan folke were at the ouen / and the
ouen was glowynge hote. Than ſayde
the foole ſage to the natural foole
whether the ouen be now hote as it
ſemeth / wyll we aſſaye ſayd the other
ye ſayd the foole ſage / but whiche of
vs ſhall go in to the ouen fyrſte for to
aſſaye. Than ſayd the naturell foole
I ſhall goo in / and thou ſhalte haue
a bolle full of water and ſtande at
the ouens mouth. And yf I fele hete
and I crye caſte caſte / anone caſte the
water after me and quenche the fyre
about me. It ſhall be done ſayd the
other foole. Than the naturell foole
toke the foole ſage a bolle full of water
in his honde / and he wente and
crepte in to the ouen / and anone as
he was in he beganne to brenne. And
anone he cryed caſte caſte. Whan the
other foole ſawe his foly he laughed
ſo enterely at his foly that vnnethes
he myght ſtonde on his fete. Than
the foole in the ouen cryed caſte man
caſte I brenne to deth. Than the other
foole anſwered / brēne yu yf brenne
wylt / dye yf thou dye wylt. I laugh
ſo that I may not caſte. And ſo the
foole brent to deth in ye ouen. By tho
two fooles I vnderſtaude men y• dye
& theyr falſe executours / for both ben
they fooles. For the executours ben
grete fooles in that / that they bynde
theym to helle payne for theyr falſehede.
But they that dye ben more fooles
in that that they truſte more to other
men than to themſelf. For whan
they ſhall crepe in to purgatorye / that
is hoter than ony ouen / than they take
to theyr executours a bolle full of
water in theyr honde / that is to ſaye
golde and ſyluer and other rycheſſes
for to do almeſſe for them / and by almeſdede
/ by maſſes ſyngynge / & holy
prayers refreſſhe them in theyr paynes
/ & kele the fyre about theym. But
comonly whan they haue this bolle
of water in theyr honde / & haue the
goodes at theyr wyll / they laugh ſo &
make ſo mery and fare ſo well with
the goodes of the deed / that they may
no thynge caſt after them / for they be
full loth to forgo ony of the goodes.

And he excuſed hym & ſayd. I praye
the haue me excuſed / for I am ſo beſye

Leue frende I am aſhamed to ſpeke

than he anſwered hym and ſayd. Leue

                     〈◊〉

theſe dayes / as longe as a man is

in welth ſo longe he ſhall haue frendes
ynough to take of him what they

and many enemyes. Therfore ſayth
the wyſe man. Tempore felici multi
numerantur amici. Cum fortuna perit
nullus amicus erit. In tyme of

But whan rycheſſes & hap is

By this ryche man I vnderſtande euery
man yt hath rycheſſes & goodes
of this worlde. By his fyrſte frende y•
he loued ſoo moche whiche gaaf hym
but a ſhete to be buryed in I vnderſtā
                  de
the worlde / whiche worldely men
loue ſo moche / y• for loue therof they
trauayle nyght & daye & put them in
peryl of bodye & ſoule / & oft leſe them
ſelfe both bodye & ſoule. And yet at ye
laſt ende vnnethes gyueth it to them
a ſhete to be buryed in. For many of
them whan they dye haue leſſe than
nought. And yf they haue ought / yet
theyr executours wyll ſaye y• they haue
nought / & yt they owe more than
they haue. By the ſeconde frende that
went with hym to the yate I vnderſtande
a mannes wyfe / his childern &
his bodely frendes. And a womannes
huſbonde / her childern / & her bodely
frendes / whiche whan they ben deed / ſhall
go with them on waye to the yate
& brynge them to theyr graue / & per
auenture ſtande and wepe on them.
But be man or woman deed & doluen
vnder claye / he is ſoone forgeten
& out of mynde paſſed awaye. Be the
belles ronge and the maſſes ſonge he
is ſoone forgeten. Vnnethes ſhall he
fynde one frende that wyll ſynge for
hym one maſſe vnnethes in the yere.
By the thrydde frende whiche he loued
ſoo lytell and whiche halpe hym
at his nede I vnderſtande almeſdede
whiche the worldely couetouſe men loue
full lytyll. And yet at the dredeful
dome whan they ſhall ſtande at the

Iheſn / than almeſſe dede ſhall be
the beſte frende that they ſhall haue.
For that ſhall ſpeke for theym and
praye for theym and ſaue theym yf
they ſhall be ſaued. And therfore Salomon
ſayth. Conclude elemoſmam

Therfore leue frende doo ye as Tobye

gyue him drynke. The charyte of cryſten

¶Pauper Er he ſhall gyue the ſentence

For in y• he is man he is brother to vs

This opynyon is more pleaſaūt

But whan Moyſes reherſed ayen the

there Moyſes forbad fyrſte couety

we rede Deut• .v. what was cauſe of
this dyuerſyte. ¶Pauꝑ. Whan god
gaf them y• lawe in the moūt of Synay
they were in deſert in grete myſcheef
/ & therfore they were more enclyned
to robberye than to lecherye. And
therfore god for yt tyme forbydeth thē

for yt tyme forbade them fyrſt couetyſe

of the childern of Iſrael .xl. yere in

yt man & woman in his youth & in his

couetyſe of the fleſſhe / & in his
endynge & in his age latter tempted
to couetyſe of the eye & of worldely
good / than to couetyſe of the fleſſhe
for in olde folke whan al other temptacyons
ceſſe / than is temptacyon of
couetyſe of the eye & of worldely good
mooſt brennynge. For ryght as theyr
bodye by age nygheth to the erth / ſoo
theyr herte clyueth than mooſt to erthely

of theyr pylgrymage in deſert
as to begynnynge folke / god forbadde
them fyrſte & pryncypaly couetyſe
of the eye & in the ende of theyr
pylgrymage / as to folke nyghe theyr

& laſte / and mooſt openly without oft
reherſynge couetyſe of the eye. For comonly
the more that men nygh ther
ende the more couetouſe they ben.

muſte be well ware that by ſuche arraye
they falle not in pryde ne in lecherye

ſhe herde ſaye that a man was fallen
in to harde temptacōn of lecherye bycau

of her beaute / ſhe cloſed herſelf
in an houſe & wolde neuer ſee man
after ne come out of yt houſe / but toke
her lyuynge in to her by a ſmalle wyked
Men axed her why ſhe dyde ſo.
And ſhe ſaye that ſhe hadde leuer to
ſhytte herſelfe all quyck in the graue
than to harme ony ſoule that god made
to his lykeneſſe & bought ſoo dere
with his precyous blood. We rede alſo
in the lyfe of ſaynt Bryde / yt a man
wolde haue wedded her for her beaute
/ & ſhe prayed god that he wolde ſen
do her ſome blemyſſhynge of her face

made her a nūne as a woman vnable

Thus ſholde wymen beſely kepe thē

it is nedefull to euery cryſten man to

I haue ſayd. But more ouer as ſaynt
Poule ſayth. He mnſte arme hȳ with
gooſtley armure ayenſt the dyntes &

For as ſaynt Poule ſayth ad Eph. vi.
All our fyghtynge is ayenſt the wycked
ſpyrytes of derkeneſſes / whiche
be prynces & powers and gouernours
of ſynfull men. Therfore he ſayth.
Arme ye you in the armure of god
that ye may withſtande the buſſhement

ſtande parfyght in al thynges. Stande
ye ſayth he in treuth / and gyrde ye
your lendes with the gyrdel of chaſtyte
/ & do ye on the habergeon of ryght

of y• goſpell of peas. And in all
thynges take ye to you the ſhelde of
fayth with whiche ye may quenche al
the brennynge dartes of y• wycked fende
And take ye you y• baſyn̄et of helth
& the ſwerde of the holy gooſt / that is
goddes worde / whiche as he ſayth in another

egged ſwerde. ad Hebre .iiij. And by almaner
prayers & beſechynge praye ye
euery tyme & alwaye in ſpiryte / & wake
ye alwaye in him in all maner beſyneſſe.
And thus ſaynt Poule by the
lykeneſſe of bodely armure techeth vs
gooſtly armure / & techeth vs well to
arme our lendes by the vertue of chaſtyte
/ whan he byddeth vs gyrde well
our lendes. And than he byddeth vs
do on the habergeon of ryghtfulneſſe
in defence both of bodye & ſoule / y• we
do ryght to all & yelde to god & to euery
creature yt longeth to hym / both
to our ſoueraynes & to our felowes &

theym that ben behynde vs to come
by ſauynge of theyr ryght & of theyr

behynde & byfore & in euery ſyde with
the habergeon of ryghtfulneſſe. And
ryght as in the habergeon euery rynge
accordeth wt other & is knytt with
other. So ſholde all our ryghtfulnes
accorde to gydre & ſo be knytt to gydre
yt we do ryght to all / ſoo yt we do
no man ne woman wronge. For yf
we do ſo moche ryght & fauour to one
that it be hyndrynge to an others

of ryghtfulnes accorde not ne be well
knytt to gydre. But ther is an hole
wherby the fende may hurte our ſoule.
Alſo he byddeth vs arme our feet

& our legges with legge harneys that
is gooſtly pouerte yt we withdrawe our
hertes & our affeccyons from erthely
thynges / & not ſet our loue to moche
in erthly thynges / ne in worldely goodes

worldely goodes / but y• more nede compell

                  te our legges
& our feet that is to ſaye / our loue
& our affeccōns ayenſt the temptacyons

byddeth vs ſhoe our feet in to y• dyghtynge
of the goſpell of peas. For euery
cryſten man & woman ought to haue
goſtly pouerte whiche cryſt taught

forther them yt can in techynge of the
goſpell & of goddes lawe / & helpe thē

yf he may & they haue nede.
Alſo he byddeth vs take to vs the ſhelde
of fayth / for as the ſhelde is a tryangle
& hath thre corners / in whiche
tryangle yf fro y• myddes be drawen
thre lynes in to the thre corners / ther
ſholde be thre tryangles / whiche thre
be but one tryangle / and yet none of
them is other. And therfore he ſayth / that
fayth of the holy trynyte is lykened
to a ſhelde / for ther ben thre perſones
in y• holy trynyte / the fader / the
ſone / & the holy gooſt / & eche of them
is god / and none of theym is ether / &
though they ben al thre but one god
in mageſte. This ſhelde of fayth of
the holy trynyte we muſte take to vs
in gooſtly fyght & byleue in the holy
trynyte / and ſet all our fayth & al our

he byddeth vs to take to vs the balynet
of helth & of ſaluacyon / as ſayth
the gloſe / hope to haue the mayſtrye
of our enemyes by the helpe of god / and
heuen blyſſe to our mede for our
fyghtynge and for our trauayle. For
ther wyll no man put hym to laufull
fyght / but in hope to haue the mayſtrye

the baſynet well arayed is clene furbuſſhed
from ruſte / & made ſlyke and
ſmothe that ſhot may ſoone glyde of

pryncypaly go vp to god / and not ſet
our hope ne our truſte to moche in
mannes myght ne in erthely helpe / whiche
is but ruſte waſtynge the baſynet
of hope yt we owe to god. Therfore
ſayth the prophete Ieremye. Curſed

& in fleſſhely myght / & letteth his herte
go awaye fro god. And blyſſed be

vs wake in all maner beſyneſſe of gode
werkes For as the wyſe man ſayth
Eccl .xxxiij. Ydelſhyp & ſlouth is cauſe
of moche wyckedneſſe. For an ydel
man & luſtles is lyke a man hondeles
& wepenles amonge his enemyes / &
lyke a man in batayll with naked armes
& hondes / whiche for nakedneſſe
& for defaute of armure leſeth bothe
arme & honde. Alſo we muſte do aboue
the Iacke or the acton of charyte.
For as the Iacke is ſofte & neſſhe and
by his ſofteneſſe & neſſheneſſe ſofteth
& feynteth all ſtrokes yt cometh there
ayenſt / ſoo charyte ſofteth & feynteth
all the dentees of the fendes temptacōn.
Therfor ſaynt Poule ſayth / that
charyte ſuffreth all thynge pacyently

ſayth the gloſe there / that charyte

of others myſcheef ben the

betokened by the cloth of cryſte without

in tyme of his paſſyon the

In token yt euery good knyght of
god ſholde be beſy to arme hym with
the cloth & the Iacke & the armure of
charyte / & trauayle to ſaue peas and
vnyte / & make no dyuyſyon. For the
ende of euery batayle ſholde be peas / and
to y• ende & for none other men
of armes ſholde trauayle & fyght / as
ſaynt Auſten ſayth. Thus leue frende
I prayr you yt ye arme you in gooſtly
armure as goddes good knyght.
For though ye be not able to bodely

In that yt ye be cryſten ye be cryſtus

to lyue with his moder. For all his
lyfe in pryſon that was fyrſt lykynge
ynough to hȳ ſholde than be full bytter
/ & he ſholde neuer haue Ioye ne reſte
in herte tyll he came ayen to yt welfare
yt he ſawe out of pryſon. Ryght
thus folke of this worlde borne and
brought forth in ſorowe & care & moche
trauayl in the pryſon of this worlde
/ they haue ſo moche loue & lykynge
to theyr erthly moder & to ther cō
                  panye
/ that is to ſaye / in erth & in erthely
thynges / for erth is moder of al
that they haue no lykynge in heuenly
thynges / ne longe not therafter.
And yet theyr goſtly moder holy chirche
& ther gooſtly fader and god him
ſelfe fader of all telleth them of the
blyſſe of heuen. It is to them but a
dreme / as is the moders tale to her
childe in pryſon / & they haue noo ſad
fayth therin. And though it be ſo as
our mod holy chirche telleth vs thoughe
the childe byleue not that ſuche
welfare be out of pryſon / the welfare
is neuer the leſſe / & though erthely couetouſe
men haue no lykynge but in
erth & in erthly thynges byleue not y•
ſuche blyſſe be in heuen yet ther is ſuche
blyſſe and neuer the leſſe for theyr
falſe byleue. But had they ones ſene
& aſſayed a lytell of that blyſſe / al the
Ioye & lykynge yt they haue in this
worlde & in erthly thynges ſholde be
to them full grete bytterneſſe full of
ſorowe & care. Example we haue of
ſaynt Peter whom Cryſte ledde vpon
the hylle of Thabor with ſaynt Iohn
& ſaynt Iames / and there he ſhewed
them but a lytell of the blyſſe of his
manhode. His face ſhone as bryght
as the ſonne / his clothes were whyte
as ſnowe. Moyſes and Hely appered
with hym in grete blyſſe & mageſtee.
Than Peter ſayd to our lorde Iheſu
Lorde it is good to vs to be here. Make
we here thre tabernacles / one to the
an other to Moyſes / & an other to Hely
/ and let vs all dwelle here. Luce .ix.
And anone in ſyght of lytel blyſſe he
forgat al the blyſſe of this worlde. He
cared neyther for mete drynke ne clothynge
/ for hym thought he myght
haue lyued without ende by the blyſfull
ſyght & with that company. Alſo
whan ſaynt Poule was rauyſſhed in
to heuen & had ſeen y• vyſyon of god
afterwarde all his lyf in this worlde
was to him a payne / ſo moche he longed
ayen to yt blyſſe. And therfore he
ſayd. Infelix ego quis me liberabit demorte
corꝑis huiꝰ . Ro.vij. I an vnſely
man who ſhall delyuer me fro y• deth
of this body I coueyte to be departed
the ſoule from the bodye & be without
ende with cryſte. Moyſes was wt god
in the moūt of Synay .xl. dayes. and
xl. nyghtes meteleſſe & drynkeles fedd
by the ſpeche of god & by his preſence
/ & yet ſawe he but lytell of this
blyſſe. For he was not able to ſee his
blyſſe / ne noman lyuynge in this worlde
/ as god ſayd to hym y• tyme. But
leue frende after our deth yf we kepe
well goddes commaundementes and
amende our myſdedes by our lyfe / we
ſhal ſee his grete blyſſe whiche neither

Peter ne Poule ne Moyſes myght ſee
in erthe. And we ſhalbe ſyker of that
blyſſe without ende. Whiche blyſſe as
ſaynt Poule ſayth y• none erthely eye
may ſee / ne ere here / ne herte thynke / ne
wytte comprehende. In this blyſſe
leue frende I hope to ſee you & dwelle
with you in the hyghe cyte of Ieruſalem
in the kynges courte of heuen.
To whiche blyſſe he brynge vs / that
for vs dyed on the rode tree. Amen.
