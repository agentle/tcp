               The Persecuted speaketh.
               ¶ I fear not for death, nor passe nor for bands:
               Only in God put I my whole trust,
               For God wil requyre my blod at your hands,
               And this I know, that once dye I must,
               Only for Christ, my lyfe if I gyue:
               Death is no death, but a meane for to lyue.
