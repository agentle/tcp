            Vnto the reader.
            
               
                  HEre haſt thou deare Reader an Expoſicion vnto the .v.vi. and .vii. Chapters of Mathewe. wherin Chriſte our ſpirituall Iſaac diggeth agayne the welles of Abraham, which welles the ſcrybes and phareſes, thoſe wycked and ſpiteful philiſtines, hade ſtopped and fylled vp with the erthe of theyr falſe expoſicyons. He openeth the kyngdome of heuen which they had ſhut vp that other men ſhulde not enter, as they them ſelues hade no luſte to go in. He reſtoreth the keye of knowledge whiche they hade taken awaye and broken the wardes with wreſtynge the text contrary to his due and naturall courſe, with theyr falſe gloſes. He pluckethe awaye from the face of Moyſes, the vayle which the ſcrybes and phareſes hade ſpred theron, that no man myght perceaue the bryghtnes of hys countenaunce. He wedeth out the thornes and buſſhes of theyr phareſaicall gloſes, wherwith they hade ſtopped vp the narowe way and ſtrayt gate, that fewe coude fynde them.
            The welles of Abraham, are the ſcrypture.Abrahams wellos The kyngdome of heuen who it is. And the ſcrypture may well be called the kyngdome of heuen, whiche is eternall lyfe, and nothynge ſaue the knowledge of God the father and of his ſon Ieſus Chriſte. Iohan. xvii. Moyſes face is the lawe in hir ryght vnderſtandyng. And

the lawe in her ryght vnderſtandynge is the keye or at the leeſt way the fyrſte and princypal keye to open the dore of the ſcrypture.The keye what it is. The lawe is the waye that ledeth to Chryſte. And the lawe is the very waye that bryngethe vnto the dore Chryſte, as it is wrytten. Gala. iii. The lawe was our ſcole mayſter to brynge vs to Chryſte, that we myght be iuſtefyed by faythe. And Roman. x. the ende of the lawe, that is to ſay, the thynge or cauſe why the lawe was gyuen, is Chryſte, to iuſtefye all that beleue. That is to ſaye, the lawe was gyuen to proue vs vnryghtuous and to dryue vs to Chryſte,lawe what 
                     •
                  er office is to be made ryghtwyſe thorowe forgyuenes of ſynne by hym. The lawe was gyuen to make the ſynne knowen ſay the ſaynte Paule. Rom. iiii. and that ſyn commytted vnder the lawe myght be the more ſynfull. Roma. vii. The lawe is that thynge, which Paule in his inwarde man graunted to be good, but was yet compelled ofte tymes of hys members to do thoſe thynges whiche that good lawe condemned for euell. Roma. vii.
            The lawe makethe no man to loue the lawe or leſſe to do or commytte ſynne, but gendereth more luſt. Roma. vii. and increſeth ſyn. Roma. v. For I can not but hate the lawe, in as moche as I fynde no power to do it, and it neuertheles condemneth me bycauſe I do it not. The lawe ſetteth not at one with God, but cauſeth wrathe. Roma. iii.
            The lawe was gyuen by Moyſes, but grace and veryte by Ieſus Chryſte. Iohan. i. Beholde thoughe Moyſes gaue the lawe, yet he gaue no

man grace to do it or to vnderſtande it a ryght or wrote it in any mānes harte, to conſente that it was good, and to wyſhe after power to fulfyl it. But Chryſte geueth grace to do it and to vnderſtande it a ryght, and wryteth it with his holy ſpirite in the tables of the hartes of men, and maketh it a true thinge there and no ypocreſy.
            The lawe truly vnderſtande,The braſe
                     •
                   ſerpente. Num. xxi. is thoſe Fyrye ſerpētes that ſtonge the chyldren of Iſrael with preſent dethe. But Chryſte is the braſen ſerpent on whome who ſo euer beinge ſtonge with conſeyence of ſynne, loketh with a ſure faythe, is heled immediately of that ſtyngynge and ſaued from the paynes and ſorowes of hel.
            It is one thynge to condemne and pronounce the ſentence of dethe,The lawe and faythe be of contrary operacyons. and to ſtynge the conſcyence with feare of euerlaſtynge payne. And it is another thynge to iuſtyfye from ſynne, that is to ſaye, forgyue and remytte ſynne and to hele the conſcyence, and certefy a man not onely that he is delyuered from eternall dethe, but alſo that he is made the ſon of God and heyre of euerlaſtynge lyfe. The fyrſte is the offyce of the lawe. The ſeconde partayneth vnto Chriſt only thorowe faythe.
            Nowe yf thou geue the lawe a falſe gloſe and ſay,The ſcrypture howe it is locke
                     •
                   vppe. that the lawe is a thynge whiche a man maye do of hys owne ſtrength, euen out of the power of his frewyll. and that by the dedes of the lawe thou mayſte deſerue forgyuenes of thy fore ſynnes. Then dyed Chiſte in vayne, Galat, ii, and is made almoſte of no ſteade, ſeynge thou arte become

thyne owne ſauyoure. Nether can Chryſte (where that gloſe is admitted) be otherwyſe taken or eſtemed of Chryſten men (for all his paſſyon and promyſes made to vs in hys bloude) then he is of the turkes, howe that he was a holy prophete. and that he prayeth for vs as other ſayntes do, ſaue that we Chryſten thynke that he is ſomewhat more in fauoure then other ſayntes be (thoughe we ymagyne hym ſo proude that he wyll not here vs but thorowe hys mylde mother and other holye ſayntes, whiche all we counte moche more meke and mercyfull then he, but hym moſte of myght) and that he hathe alſo an hygher place in heuen, as the graye freres and obſeruauntes ſet hym, as it were from the chynne vpwarde aboue ſaynt Fraunces.
            And ſo when by this falſe interpretacion of the lawe, Chryſte whiche is the dore, the waye and the grounde or foundacyon of al the ſcrypture, is loſt cōcernyng the chefeſt frut of his paſſyon, and no more ſene in his owne likenes, then is the ſcripture locked vppe. and henceforth extreme darkenes and a mace, wherī if thou walke thou wotteſte nether where thou a
                  •
               te, nor canſte fynde any waye out. It is a confuſed Chaos, and a mynglynge of all thynges togyther with out order, euery thynge contrarye to another. It is an hedge or groue of bryers. wherin yf thou be caught, it is impoſſyble to gette out, but that yf thou lowſe thy ſelfe in one place 'thou arte tangeled and caught in another for it.
            This wyſe was the ſcrypture locked vp of

the ſcrybes and phareſes, that the Iewes coude not ſe Chryſte when he came, nor yet can. And though Chryſt with theſe .iii. chapters dyd open it agayne, yet by ſuche gloſes, for oure vnthanke fulnes ſake that we hade no luſte to lyue accordynge. haue we Chryſten loſte Chryſte agayne, and the vnderſtandynge of the moſte clere texte wherwith Chryſte expoundeth and reſtoreth the lawe agayne.
            For the ypocrytes what ſo euer ſemeth ympoſſyble to theyr corrupte nature vnrenued in Chryſte, that they couer ouer with the myſte of theyr gloſes, that the lyght therof myght not be ſene. As they haue interpretate here the wordes of Chryſt wherwith he reſtoreth the lawe agayne to be but good counſelles onely, but no preceptes that bynde the conſcyence.
            And therto they haue ſo rofelled and tangeled the temporal and ſpirituall regimente togyther,Chriſt vſe
                     •
                   no tēpora
                     •
                   regyment▪
                and made therof ſuche confuſyon that no man can knowe the one from the other, to the entent that they wolde ſeme to haue bothe by the auctorite of Chriſte, which neuer vſurped temporal regyment vnto hym.
            Notwithſtandynge (moſte deare reder) yf thou reade thys expoſycyon with a good harte only to knowe the truth for the amendynge chefely of thyn owne lyuinge and then of other mē
               nes (as charyte reqyreth where an occaſyō is geuen) then ſhalt thou perceyue their falſhepe, and ſe their myſte expelled with the brightnes of the incuytable truthe.
            
               
               Chriſt is a gyfte gyuē only to thē that loue lawe and profeſſe it.A nother concluſyon is this, al the good promyſes whiche are made vs thorowe out all the ſcripture for Chryſtes ſake, for his loue, his paſſyon or ſuffrynge, his bloude ſhedynge or dethe al are made vs on this condicyon and couenaunt on our partye, that we henceforth loue the lawe of God, to walke therin and to do it and faſſyon our lyues therafter. In ſo moche that who ſo euer hathe not the lawe of God wrytten in hys herte, that he loue it, haue his luſte in it, and recorde therin nyght and daye,He that profeſſeth not 
                     •

                  romyſes. vnderſtandynge it as God hathe gyuen it, and as Chryſt and the Apoſtles expounde it, The ſame hath no parte in the promyſes, or can haue any true faythe in the bloude of Chryſte, becauſe there is no promyſe made hym, but to them onely that promyſe to kepe the lawe.
            Thou wylte happely ſaye to me agayne, yf I can not haue my ſynnes forgyuen excepte I loue the lawe, and of loue endeuour my ſelfe to kepe it,Yorkes 
                     •

                     •
                  yfye. then the kepynge of the lawe iuſtefyethe me, I anſwere that the argumente is falſe and but blynde ſopheſtrye, and like vnto this argument, I can not haue forgyuenes of my ſynne excepte I haue ſynned, Ergo to haue ſinned is the forgeuenes of ſyn. And it is lyke to this alſo, No nan can be heled of the pokes but he that hath thē, Ergo to haue the pockes doth heale the pockes. And lyke ſopheſtrye are theſe argumentes, yf thou wylt enter into lyfe, kepe the commaundementes. Matth. xix, Ergo the dedes of the lawe iuſtefye vs. Item the herars of the lawe are not

ryghteous in the ſyght of God, but the doers of the lawe ſhalbe iuſtefyed. Roma. ii. Ergo the dedes of the lawe iuſtefye from ſyn. And agayne we muſt al ſtande before the iudgement ſeate of Chryſte,ii. Cor. v. to receaue euery man accordynge to the dedes which he dyd in the body. Ergo the lawe or the dedes of the lawe iuſtefye.
            Theſe and all ſuche are naughtye argumentes For ye ſe that the kinge pardoneth no murderar but on a condycyon, that he henceforth kepe the lawe and do no more ſo, and yet ye knowe well ynough that he is ſaued by grace, fauour & pardone, yer the kepyng of the lawe come. Howebeit, yf he breake the lawe afterwarde, he falleth agayne into the ſame daunger of dethe.
            Euen ſo,The lawe by kepyng ye lawe we contynue in grace. none of vs can be receaued to grace but vpon a condiciō to kepe the lawe, nether yet contynue any longer in grace then that purpoſe laſteth. And yf we breake, the lawe we muſte ſue for a newe pardon, and haue a newe fyght againſt ſyn, hel and deſperacion, yer we can come to a quyet faythe agayne and fele that the ſynne is forgeuē. Nether can ther be in the a ſtable and an vndouted faythe that thy ſyn is forgyuen the, excepte there be alſo a luſtye courage in thyne herte and a truſte that thou wylte ſynne no more for on that condycyon that thou endeuoure thy ſelfe to ſynne no more, is the promyſe of mercy and forgyuenes made vnto the.
            And as thy loue to the lawe increaſeth ſo dothe thy faythe in Chryſte,Fayth, loue and hope are inſeperable ī this lyfe. and ſo dothe thyne

hope and longynge for the lyfe to come. And as thy loue is colde, ſo is thy fayth weake, and thyne hope and longynge for the lyfe to come lytle. And where no loue to the lawe is, theyr is nether faythe in Chryſte for the forgyuenes of ſynne, nor longynge for the lyfe to come, but in ſtede of faythe, wycked ymagynacyon that God is ſo vnryghteous that he is not offendyd with ſynne. And in ſtede of hope, a deſyer to liue euer here, and agredynes of worldly voluptuouſnes.
            
               The lawe they that loue not the lawe can not vnderſtande the ſcrypture to ſaluacyon.And vnto al ſuche is the ſcrypture locked vp and made ympoſſyble to vnderſtande. They maye reade it and reherſe the ſtories therof, and dyſpute of it, as the turkes maye, and as we may of the turkes lawe. And they maye ſucke pryde ypocreſye and all maner of poyſon therout to ſlaye theyr owne ſoules, and to put ſtomblynge blockes in other mennes wayes, to thruſte them from the truthe, and to get ſuche lernynge therin as in Aryſtotelles Etykes and morall Philoſophie, and in the preceptes of olde philoſophers But it is ympoſſyble for them to applye one ſentence therof to theyr ſoules helthe or to faſſyon theyr lyues therby for to pleſe God, or to make them to loue the lawe or vnderſtande it, ether to feale the power of Chryſtes dethe and myght of his reſurrection and ſwetnes of the lyfe to come. So that they euer remayne carnal and fleſhly, as thou haſte an enſample of the Scrybes, Phariſes and Iewes in the newe teſtament.
            
               Care howe God careth for the weakeA nother concluſyon is thys, of them that beleue in Chryſte for the remyſſyon of ſyn and loue

the lawe, are a thowſande degrees and not ſo fewe, one perfecter or weaker than another, of whiche a greate ſorte are ſo feble that they can nether go forwarde in theyr profeſſion and purpoſe, nor yet ſtande excepte they be holpen and borne of theyr ſtronger bretherne, and tendyd as yonge chyldren are by the care of theyr fathers and mothers. And therfore dothe God commaunde the elder to care for the yonger. As Paule techeth. Roma. xv. ſaynge. we that be ſtronger, ought to beare the feblenes of the weaker. And. Cala. vi. bretheren yf any man be caught in any faute, ye that be ſpirituall (and are growen in knowledge and haue gotten the vyctorye of your fleſhe) teache ſuche with the ſpirite of ſoftenes. not calynge them heretykes at the fyrſte choppe, and thretenynge them with fyer and faggotes. But alter alterius onera portate (ſayth he) et ſic adimplebitis legem Chriſti, That is to ſaye, beare eche others burthen, and ſo ſhal ye fulfyl the lawe of Chryſte. Euen ſo verely ſhall ye fulfyll the lawe of Chriſte, and not with ſmytinge your brethren and puttyng ſtumblinge blockes before theyr weake fete, and kyllynge theyr conſcience, and makyng them more afrayde of ſhadowes and bugges, then to breke theyr fathers commaundementes, and to truſte in wordes of winde and vanyte more then in theyr fathers promyſe.
            And for theyr ſakes alſo,Rulers why they were or. dayned. he hathe ordyned rulers bothe ſpirituall and temporall to teache them and exorte them, to warne thē and to kepe

               To ſyn vnder grace and to ſyn vnder the lawe.Of this ye ſe the dyfference betwene the ſyn of them that beleue in the bloude of Chryſte for the remyſſyon of ſynne, and cōſent and ſubmitte them ſelues vnto the lawe. and the ſynne of them that yelde them ſelues vnto ſyn to ſerue it. &c. The fyrſte ſynne vnder grace 
                  •
                and theyr ſynnes are venyall, that is to ſaye, forgeueable. The other ſynne vnder the lawe and vnder the damnacyon of the lawe, and fyght (for a great parte of them) agaynſte grace and agaynſte the ſpirite of grace, and agaynſt the lawe of God and fayth of Chriſt, and corrupte the texte of the couenaūt with falſe gloſes, and are dyſobedyent to God and therfore ſynne dedly.
            
               Of this alſo ye ſe the dyfference betwene the lambes of true beleuers,Lambes. Swyne. Dogges. and betwene the vnclene ſwyne that folowe carnal luſtes and fleſhly lybertye, and the churlyſhe and ypocrytyſhe dogges, which for the blynde zele of their owne ryghtwyſnes, perſecute the ryghtwyſnes of the faythe in Chryſtes bloude.Swyne haue no fayth The effemynate and careles ſwine which contynue in their fleſhlynes and ceaſe not to walow them ſelues in their olde podell, thynke that they beleue very well in Chriſtes bloude, but they are deceaued (as thou mayſte clerly perceaue) becauſe they feare not the dānacyon of euyl workes, nor loue the lawe of good workes, and therfore haue no parte in the promiſe.
            
               
                  〈…〉
                and doggyſhe ypocrytes whiche take vpon them to worke,Dogges loue not the lawe. thynke they loue the lawe, whiche yet they neuer ſawe, ſaue vnder avayle. But they be deceaued (as thou mayſte perceaue) by that they beleue not in Chryſte for the forgeuenes of ſynne, wherbye alſo (I meane they that beleue not) thou mayſte perceaue that they vnderſtande not the lawe. For yf they vnderſtode the lawe, it wolde ether dryue them to Chryſte or make dyſpare ymmedyatly.
            But the true beleuers beholde the lawe in her owne lykenes and ſe the ympoſſybilite ther of to be fulfylled with natural power,True fayth is coupled with loue to the lawe and therfore fle to Chryſte for mercy, grace and power, and then of a very thankefulnes for the mercy receaued, loue the lawe in hyr owne lykenes, and ſubmytte them ſelue to lerne it and to proffyte

therin and to do to morowe that they can not do to day. Ye ſe alſo the dyfference of all maner of faythes. The faythe of the true beleuer is that God iuſtefyeth or forgeueth, and Chriſte deſerueth it,The differē
                  ce of faythes, and howe it is to be vnderſtāde fayth iuſtfyeth. and the fayth or truſte in Chriſtes bloude receueth it and certefyeth the conſcyence therof, and ſaueth and delyuereth her from fere of deth and damnacion. And this is that we meane when we ſay, faythe iuſtefyeth, that faythe (I meane in Chriſte and not in oure owne workes) certefyeth the cōſcience that our ſynnes are forgeuen vs for Chryſtes bloude ſake.
            
               Fayth of ypocrytes.But the faythe of ypocrytes is that God forgeueth and that workes deſerue it, And that ſame falſe faythe in theyr owne workes receaueth the mercye promyſed to the merytes of theyr owne workes, And ſo Chryſte is vtterly excluded And thus ye ſe that faythe is the thynge that is affyrmed to iuſtefye, of all partyes, For fayth in Chriſtes bloude (whiche is Goddes promyſe) quieteth the cōſcyence of the true beleuers, And a falſe faythe or truſte in workes (which is theyr owne fayninge) begyleth the blynde ypocrytes for a ceaſon, tyll god for the greatnes of theyr ſynne,Faythe of ſwyne. when it is full openeth theyr eyes, and then they dyſpare, But the ſwyne ſay, God is ſo good that he wyl ſaue deuelles and al, and damne no man perpetually, what ſo euer he do.
            Another cōcluſyon is thys, to beleue in Chriſt for the remyſſyō of ſynnes, and of a thankfulnes for that mercy to loue the lawe truly, that is to ſay, to loue God that is father of all and geueth

all, and Ieſus Chryſte that is lorde of vs all and bought vs al, with al our hartes, ſoules, power & myght, and our bretheren for our fathers ſake (becauſe they be created after his image) and for our lorde and maſter Chriſtes ſake becauſe they be the pryce of hys bloude, and to longe for the lyfe to come, becauſe this lyfe can not be ledde with out ſynne. Theſe. iii. poyntes (I ſaye) are the profeſſyon and relygion of a Chryſten man, and the inwarde baptyme of the harte ſygnified by the outwarde waſſhynge of the body.The ryght baptyme. And they be that ſpiritual charactter, badge or ſygne, wherwith God thorowe hys ſpyrite marketh all hys immedyatly and aſſone as they be ioyned to Chryſte and made members of hys churche by true faythe.
            The churche of Chriſt then,The church of Chryſte is the multytude of al thē that beleue in Chryſt for the remyſſyon of ſyn. and of a thankfulnes for that mercy, loue the lawe of God purely and without gloſes, and of hate they haue to the ſyn of thys world, longe for the lyfe to come,
            Thys is the churche that can not erre dampnablye nor any longe tyme, or all of them, but aſſone as anye queſtyon aryſeth, the truthe of Goddes promiſe ſtereth vp one or other to teche them the truth of euery thynge nedefull to ſaluacyon out of Goddes worde, and lyghteneth the hartes of the other true members to ſe the ſame and to conſent therto.
            And as all they that haue theyr hartes waſſhed with thys inwarde baptyme of the ſpyryte

are of the church and haue the keyes of the ſcrypture, ye and of byndynge and lowſynge and do not erre, Euen ſo they that ſynne of purpoſe and wyll not heare when theyr fautes be tolde them, but ſeke lybertyes and pryuyleges to ſyne vnpunyſſhed, and gloſe out the lawe of God, and mayntene ceremonyes, tradicyons and cuſtomes, to deſtroy the fayth of Chryſte, the ſame be members of Sathan, and all theyr doctryne is poyſon, erroure and darkenes, ye thoughe they be Popes, Byſſhoppes, Abbotes, Curates and doctoures of dyuynyte, and though they can reherſe all the ſcrypture without booke, and thoughe they be ſene in greke, Ebrewe and latyne, ye and though they ſo preache Chryſte and the paſſyon of Chryſte that they make the poore wemen wepe and howle agayne.

And yf they accompany not one another, all thre, together, then be ſure that all is but ypocreſye.
            Yf you ſay, ſeynge faythee loue and hope bethre vertues inſeperable. Ergo faythe onely iuſtefyeth not.

            And as ofte as we ſynne, fayth onely kepeth that we forſake not our profeſſyō, and that loue vtterly quenche not, and hope fayle, and onely maketh the peace agayne, For a true beleuer truſteth in Chriſt onely, and not in his owne workes or ought els, for the remyſſyon of ſyn.
            
               The offyce of loue.And the offyce of loue is to powre out agayne the ſame goodnes that ſhe hathe receaued of God, vpon her neyghboure, and to be to hym as ſhe feleth Chryſte to her ſelfe. The offyce of

loue onely is to haue cōpaſſyon and to bere with her neyghboure the burthen of hys infyrmytyes. And as it is wrytten. 1. Pe. 4. Operit multitudinem peccatorum, couereth the multytude of ſynnes. That is to ſaye, conſydereth the infyrmytyes and interpreteth all to the beſte, and taketh for ſyn none at al, a thouſande thinges of which the leſte were ynoughe (yf a man loued not) to goo to lawe for and to trouble and vnquyet an hoole towne, and ſomtyme an hoole realme or two.
            And the offyce of hope is to comforte in aduerſyte and make pacyent,The offyce of hope. that we faynt not and falle downe vnder the Croſſe, or caſte it of our backes. And thus ye ſe that theſe .iii. inſeperable in thys lyfe haue yet ſeperable and ſondry offyces and effectes, as hete and dryeth beynge inſeperable in the fyer, haue yet theyr ſeperable operacyon.

               Chryſte Here in his fyrſt ſarmone begynneth to reſtore the lawe of the ten commaundementes vnto her ryght vnderſtandinge, agaynſte the ſcrybes and Pharyſes whiche were ypocrytes, falſe prophetes and falſe preachers, and had corrupte the ſcrypture with the leauen of theyr gloſes,Pouertye in ſpyryte And it is not without a great myſtery that Chryſt begynneth hys preachynge at pouertye in ſpyryte, whiche is nether beggery nor agaynſte the poſſeſſynge of rycheſſe, But a vertue contrarye to the vyce of couetouſneſſe, the inordynate deſyre and loue of reches and puttynge truſte in rycheſſe.
               Ryches is the gyfte of God geuen man to

mayntayne the degrees of thys worlde,Ryches. and therfore not euell ye and ſome muſte be poore and ſome ryche, yf we ſhal haue an order in thys worlde. And God our father deuydeth rycheſſe and pouertye amonge hys chyldren accordynge to hys godlye pleaſure and wyſdome. And as rycheſſe dothe not exclude the from the bleſſyng ſo dothe not pouertye certefye the. But to put thy truſte in the lyuynge God maketh the heyre therof. For yf thou truſte in the lyuynge god. Then yf thou be poore, thou coueteſte not to be ryche, for thou art certefyed that thy father ſhall mynyſtre vnto the fode and rayment, and be thy defender, and yf thou haue ryches, thou knoweſt that they be but vanyte, and that as thou brough teſte them not into the worlde, ſo ſhalte thou not carye them out, and that as they be thyne to daye, ſo maye they be another mannes to morowe, and that the fauoure of God onely bothe gaue and alſo kepeth the and them, and not thy wyſdome or power, and that they nether ought els can helpe at nede, ſaue the good wyll of thy heuenly father onely, Happy and bleſſed then are the poore in ſpyryte, that is to ſaye the ryche that haue not theyr confidence nor conſolacyon in the vanyte of theyr rycheſſe, and the poore that deſyre not inordynatly to be ryche, but haue theyr truſte in the lyuynge God for fode and rayment and for all that partayneth ether to the body or the ſoule, for thers is the kingdome of heuen.

For vnto them it is harder to enter into the kyngedome of heuen, then for a camell to enter thorowe the eye of an nedle. Mar. 10. No they haue no parte in the kyngedome of Chryſte and God. Ephe. v. Therfore it is euydent why Chryſte ſo dylygentlye warneth all hys to be ware of couetouſnes and why he admytted none to be hys dyſcyples excepte he fyrſte forſake altogether. For there was neuer couetous perſon true yet ether to God or man.
               Yf a couetous man be choſen to preache goddes worde,Couetouſnes is a thynge contrary to the worde of god and to the mynyſters of the ſame. he is a falſe prophete immedyatlye. Yf he be of the laye ſorte, ſo ioyneth he hym ſelfe vnto the falſe prophetes, to perſecute the truthe. Couetouſneſſe is not onely aboue all other luſtes thoſe thornes that choke the worde of God in them that poſeſſe it. But it is alſo a dedelye enemye to all that interprete goddes worde trulye.

               Yf the faythe of Chryſte and lawe of God in whiche two all ryghtuouſnes is contayned, be wrytten in thyne harte, that is, yf thou beleue in Chriſt to be iuſtefyed from ſyn or for remyſſyon of ſyn, and conſenteſt in thyne harte, to the lawe that it is good, holy and iuſte and thy duty to do it and ſubmyteſt thy ſelfe ſo to do, and ther vp on goeſt forth and teſtefyeth that fayth and lawe of ryghteouſnes openly vnto the worlde in worde and deade. Then wyll Sathan ſtere vp his members agaynſte the, and thou ſhalte be perſecuted on euerye ſyde. But be of good comforte and faynte not. Call to mynde the ſaynge of Paule. 2. Tymo. 3. howe al that wyl lyue godly in chryſt Ieſu, ſhal ſo fer perſecucyon, Remember howe al the prophetes that wēt before the, were ſo dealt with, Luke. vi. Remember the enſamples of the apoſtels, and of Chryſte hym ſelfe, and that the dyſcyple is no better then hys mayſter, and that

Chryſte admytteh no deſcyple whiche not onely leueth not all,peace, the peace of Chryſte is peace of conſcyence but alſo taketh his croſſe to, we be not called to a ſofte liuynge and to peace in this worlde. But vnto peace of conſcyence in God our father thorowe Ieſus Chryſt, and to warre in thys worlde.
               Moreouer comforte thy ſelfe with the hope of the bleſſynge of the enherytaunce of heuen, there to be gloryfyed with Chryſte yf thou here ſoffer with hym. For yf we be lyke Chryſte here in his paſſyons, and beare his ymage in ſoule and bodye, and fyght manfully ye / that Sathan blot it not out / and ſoffer with Chryſte for berynge recorde to ryghtuouſnes, then ſhall we be lyke to hym in glorye. Saynt Iohan ſaythe in the .iii. Chapter of hys fyrſte pyſtle. yet it apereth not what we ſhalbe. But we knowe / that when he apereth / we ſhalbe lyke hym. And Paule. Phil. 3. oure conuerſacyon is in heuen, whence we loke for a ſauyour, the Lorde Ieſus Chryſt which ſhal chaunge our vyle bodyes and make them lyke his gloryous body.
               It is an happy thynge to ſoffer for ryghteouſnes ſake / but not for vnryghtuouſnes. For what prayſe is it (ſay the Peter in the ſeconde of hys fyrſte epyſtle) though ye ſoffer, when ye be bofetted for your offenſes, wherfore in the fourthe of the ſame he ſaythe, ſe that none of you ſoffer as a murtherar or a theſe or an euell doer or a buſye body in other mennes maters, Suche ſofferynge gloryfyeth not God, nor thou arte therby heyre of heuen. Beware therfore that thou deſerue

not that thou ſoffereſt. But yf thou do,Payne No bodely payne can be a ſatysfaccyon to God ſaue Chryſtes paſſyon. then beware moche more of them that wolde bere the in hande, howe that ſuche ſofferynge ſhulde be ſatyſfaccyon of thy ſynnes and a deſeruynge of heuen. No, ſofferynge for ryghtuouſnes (thoughe heuen be promyſed theyrto) yet dothe it not deſerue heuen, nor yet make ſatyſfaccyon for the fore ſynnes, Chryſte dothe bothe twane. But and yf thou repente and beleue in Chryſt for the remiſſyon of ſynne, and them confeſſe, not onely before God, but alſo open before all that ſe the ſoffer / howe that thou haſte deſerued that thou ſoffreſt, for breakynge the good and ryghtwyſe lawe of thy father, and then takeſt thy punyſhement paciently / as an holſome medecyne to hele thy fleſhe that it ſynne no more / and to feare thy brethern that they fall not in to lyke offence / as Moyſes teacheth euery where. Then as thy pacyence in ſofferynge is pleſaunt in the ſyght of thy brethren whiche beholdeth, petye the and ſoffer with the in theyr hertes, euen ſo is it in ye ſyght of God, and it is to the a ſure token that thou haſte true faythe and true repentaunce.
               And as they be bleſſed which ſuffer for ryghtouſnes, euen ſo are they accurſed which ronne away and let it be troden vnder the fete / and wyll not ſuffer for the faythe of theyr Lorde and lawe of theyr father, nor ſtande by theyr neyghboures in theyr iuſte cauſes.

And yet theſe muſt be fyrſterebuked and theyr falſe ryghtwyſnes detecte, yer thou mayſte preache agaynſte open ſynners.
               Or els yf thou ſhuldeſt conuerte an open ſenner from hys euell lyuynge, thou ſhuldeſte make hym nyne hundred tymes worſe then before. For he wolde attonce be one of theſe ſorte / euen an obſeruaunt or of ſome lyke ſecte of whiche amonge an hundred thouſande, thou ſhalte neuer brynge one to beleue in Chryſte, where among open ſynners many beleue at the houre of dethe, fal flat vpon Chryſt and beleue in hym onely without all other ryghtwyſnes. It were an hundred thouſand tymes better neuer to pray, then to praye ſoche lyppe prayers and neuer to faſt or do almes then to faſte and to do almes with a mynde therby to be made ryghtuous / and to make ſatyſfaccyon for the fore ſynnes.
            
            
               
                  Ye haue harde howe that it was ſayde to them of olde tyme / kyl not / for who ſo euer kelleth ſhall be in daunger of iudgement. But I ſay vnto you / who ſoo euer is angrye with his brother / ſhall be in daunger of iudgement. And whoſoeuer

ſaye vnto his brother Racha / ſhall be in daunger of a councell. But whoſouer ſay to his brother / thou fole / ſhalbe in daunger of hell fyre.The lawe is reſtored.
                  
               
               Here Chryſte begynneth, not to deſtroy the lawe (as the pharyſeys had falſly accuſed hym) but to reſtore it agayne to the ryght vnderſtandynge and to purge it from the gloſes of the pharyſeys. He that ſleyeth ſhall be gyltye or in daunger of iudgement / that is to ſay / yf a man murther, hys dede teſtefyeth agaynſt hym, there is no more to do / then to pronounce ſentence of dethe agaynſt hym. This texte dyd the pharyſeys, extende no further then to kyll with the hande and outwarde members, But hate / enuye / malyce / churlyſhneſſe and to withdrawe helpe at neade, to begyle and cyrcumuent with wyles and ſottle bergenynge, was no ſynne at all, No, to brynge hym home, thou hatedeſt to dethe with crafte and falſhed, ſo thou dyddeſte not put thyne hande therto / was no ſynne at al. As when they had brought Chryſte to dethe wrongefully and compelled Pylate with ſotteltye to ſleye hym / they thoughte them ſelues pure. In ſo moche that they wolde not go into the hall for defylynge them ſelues and beynge partakers with Pylate in his bloud. And Ac. 5 they ſayd to the Apoſtles, ye wolde bryng this mannes bloude vpon vs / as who wolde ſaye, we ſlue hym not. And Saul in the fyrſte boke of

the Kynges in the .xviii. Cha▪ beinge ſo wrothe with Dauid, that he wold gladly haue had him ſlayne determyned yet that he wold not defyle hym ſelfe, but to thruſt hym into the handes of Phylyſtynes, that they myght ſley hym, and he hym ſelfe abyde pure.
               And as our ſpyrytualtye nowe offer a man mercy / once thoughe ye haue ſpoken agaynſte holy chyrche / onely yf he wyll but periure and bere a fagot. But yf he wyll not, they do but dyote hym a ſeaſon / to wynne hym and make hym tell more, and then delyuer hym to the lay power ſayenge, he hathe deſerued the dethe by our lawes and ye ought to kyll hym / howe be it we deſerc it not.
               ¶ But Chryſte reſtoreth the lawe agayne and ſayeth / to be angry with thy neyghboure to ſle hym and to deſerue dethe. For the lawe goeth as wel on the harte as on the hande, He that hateth his brother is a mutherar .i. Io. 3. If then the blynd hande deſerue dethe howe moche more thoſe partes which haue the ſyght of reſon. And he that ſayeth Racha / Racha. lewde or what ſo euer ſygne of wrath it be, or yt prouoketh to wrath▪ hath not only deſerued that men ſhuld immedyatly pronounce ſentence of deth vpon hym, but alſo yt when deth is pronoūced, they ſhuld gather a councel / to decre what horryble dethe he ſhuld ſuffer. And he that calleth hys brother fole / hathe ſynned downe to hel.
               
                  how a man may be angrye without ſīnyngShal then a man not be angry at al nor rebuke or ponyſhe? yes yf thou be a father or a

mother / mayſter / mayſtreſſe / huſbande / lorde / or ruler / yet with loue and mercye / that the anger / rebuke / or ponyſhmente excede not the faute or treſpas. Maye a man be angrye with loue? ye, mothers can be ſo with theyr chyldrē It is a louinge anger that hateth onely the vyce and ſtudyeth to mende the perſone. But here is forboden not only wrath agaynſte father / mother / and all that haue gouernaunce ouer the / whiche is to be angry and to grudge agaynſte God hym ſelfe / and that the ruler ſhall not be wrath without a cauſe agaynſt the ſubiecte. But alſo al pryuate wrathe agaynſt thy neyghbour ouer whome thou haſte no rule nor he ouer the, no though he do the wronge. For he that do the wronge lacketh wytte and dyſcrecyon and can not amende tyll he be informed and taught louyngly. Therfore thou muſt refrayne thy wrath and tell hym hys faute louyngly and with kyndenes wyn him to thy father / for he is thy brother as wel made and as dere bought as thou / and as wel beloued, though he be yet chyldyſhe and lacke dyſcrecyon.
               But ſome wyl ſay, I wyl not hate my neyghboure / nor yet loue hym / or do hym good.Loue is the kepyng of the lawe. yes thou muſt loue hym for the fyrſt cōmaundemēt out of which all other flowe, is, thou ſhalt loue the lorde thy God with all thyne harte / with all thy ſoule / and with all thy myght. That is / thou muſt kepe all his commaundementes with loue. Loue muſt kepe ye fro killyng or hurting thy neyboure and frō couetynge in thyne harte

what ſo euer is his. And .1. Ioh. 4. Thys commaundement haue we of hym / that he whiche loueth God, loue his brother alſo. And agayne 1. Iohan. iii. he that hathe ſubſtaunce of thys worlde and ſee hys brother haue neceſſyte, and ſhutteth vp hys compaſſyon from him, howe is the loue of God in hym? he then that helpe the not at neade louethe not God, but breketh the fyrſte commaundement. Let vs loue therfore ſayth ſaynte Io, not with worde and tonge, but in the dede and of a truthe. And agayne ſaynte Iohā ſayd in the ſayd place / he that loueth not hys brother by deth yet ſtyll in dethe. And of loue hath Moyſes textes ynoughe. But the pharyſeys gloſed them out, ſayenge they were but good councelles yf a man deſyred to be perfecte / but not preceptes. Exodi. xxiii. yf thou mete thyne enemyes oxe or aſſe goynge a ſtraye thou ſhalte in any wyſe brynge them to hym agayne. And yf thou ſe thyne enemyes aſſe falle downe vnder his burthen / thou ſhalt helpe him vp agayne. And Leuyti, xix. thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thyne hart / but ſhalt in any wyſe rebuke thy neyghboure,Synners he yt helpeth not to men
                        •
                     de ſynners muſte ſuffer with them when they be ponyſhed. that thou beare no ſyn for hys ſake. For yf thou ſtudye not to amende thy neyghboure when he ſynneth, ſo art thou partaker of hys ſynnes. And therfore whē God taketh vengeaunce and ſendeth what ſoo euer plage it be, to ponyſhe open ſinners, thou muſt peryſhe with them. For thou dydeſt ſynne in the ſyght of God as depe as they / becauſe thou dydeſt not loue the lawe of God to maynteyne

it with all thyne harte, ſoule / power and myght. Is not he that ſeeth hys nyghboures hous in ieoperdye to be ſette on fyer and warneth not, nor helpeth in tyme, to auoyde the parell, worthy yf his neyghboures hous be brent vp, that hys be brent alſo / ſeynge it was in hys power to haue kepte all out of ieoperdy, yf he had wolde / as he wolde no doute yf he had loued hys neyghboure? Euen ſo when God ſendeth a generall peſtylence or warre to thy cytye / to ponyſhe the ſynne therof / arte not thou worthy that thyne houſe ſhulde be infected or peryſhe, yf thou myghteſt haue kepte it frō ſynnynge, and thou haddeſt ben wyllynge therto? But yf thou do thy beſte to further the lawe of God and to kepe thy land or neyghboures frō ſynnyng againſt God, thē (though it pelpe not) thou ſhalte bere no ſynne for theyr ſakes when they be ponyſhed. He therfore that loueth the lawe of God, may be bolde in tyme of peſtylence and all ieoperdy to beleue in God. And agayne in the ſame place thou ſhalt not auenge thy ſelfe nor beare hate in mynde agaynſte the chyldren of thy people. But ſhall loue thy felowe as thy ſelfe, I am the lorde. As who ſhuld ſay, for my ſake ſhalt thou do it. And Deuteronomy .10. The lorde your God. is the God of Goddes and lorde of lordes, a greate God / myghty and terryble, which regardeth no mannes perſone or degree or taketh gyftes. But doth ryghte to the fatherleſſe and the wydowe, and loueth the ſtaunger, to gyue hym rayment

and fode / loue therfore the ſtraunger / for ye were ſtraungers in the lande of Egypt. And Leuytycum, .xix. yf a ſtraunger ſoiourne by the, in your lande, ſe that ye vexe hym not. But let the ſtraunger that dwelleth amonge you, be as one of your ſelfes, and loue hym as thy ſelfe. For ye were ſtraungers in the lande of Egypt / I am the lorde. As who ſhulde ſaye, loue him for my ſake.Hate when a man may hate hys neyghbour Notwithſtandynge when thy neyghboure hathe ſhewed the more vnkyndenes then God hath loue / then mayſte thou hate hym / and not before. But muſte loue hym for Goddes ſake / tyll he fyght agaynſte God to deſtroy the name and glorye of God.
            
            
               
                  Therfore when thou offereſt thy gyfte at the alter / and there remembreſte that thy brother hathe ought agaynſte the / leaue there thy gyfte before the alter / and go fyrſt and reconſyle thy ſelfe vnto thy brother / and then come and offer thy ſelfe. Agree with thyne aduerſarye attonce / whyle thou arte in the waye with hym / leaſte thyne aduerſarye delyuer the to the iudge / and the iudge delyuer the to the mynyſter / 

and thou be caſte into pryſon. Verely I ſaye vnto the / thou ſhalt not com out thence / tyl thou haue payd the vttermoſt farthynge.
               
               This texte with the ſimilitude is ſomewhat ſotle / and byndeth both hym that hathe offended to reconſyle him ſelfe as moch as in him is and hym that is offended to forgeue and be attone.Offeringes or ſacrefyces what they mente The offerynges were ſygnes and dyd certefye a man that God was at one with hym and was hys frende and loued hym. For the fat of beaſtes was offered and wine therto, as though God had ſate and eate and dronke with them, and the reſt they and theyr huſholdes dyd eate before god / as though they had eate & dronke with God, and were commaunded to be mery and to make good chere / full certefyed that God was at one with them and had forgote all olde offences, & nowe loued thē / that he wold fulfyl all his promyſes of mercy with them.
               Nowe wyl God receyue no ſacrefyce / that is to wyte / neyther forgeue or fulfyll any of hys promyſes, eycept we be fyrſt reconcyled vnto our brethren / whether we haue offended or be offended. In the Chapyter folowynge thou redeſt ye forgeue, your father ſhal forgeue you And Oſia, 6. I loue mercy & not ſacrefyce and the knowledge of God more then I do burnt offerynges / that is to ſaye / the knoweledge of the poyntementes made betwene God and vs

what he wyl haue vs to do fyrſt, and then what he wyl do for vs agayne. And Eſaias. 58. God refuſed faſtynge and ponyſhynge of the body that was coupled with crudelyte / & ſayth that he deſyred no ſuche faſt, But ſayth thys faſte requyre I, that ye be mercyfull and forgeue, and clothe the naked and fede the hungry. &c. Then cal (ſayth he) and ye lord ſhal anſwere, cry, and he ſhall ſaye, ſee, here I am.
               And that ſymylytude wyl, that as a man here yf he wyl no otherwyſe agre / he muſt ſuffer the extremite of the lawe, yf he be brought afore a iudge (for the iudge hath no power to forgeue or to remyte, but to cōdemne hym in the vtmoſt of the lawe) euen ſo / yf we wyll not forgeue one another here, we ſhall haue iudgement of God, without mercy.
               And that ſome make purgatory of the laſt farthynge,Laſte ferthynge. they ſhewe theyr depe ignoraunce. For fyrſt no ſymylytude holdeth euery worde and ſyllable of ye ſimilitude, furthermore whē they dyſpute / tyll he paye the laſte ferthynge, ergo he ſhal paye. But not in hell, ergo in purgatory. A wyſe reſon. Ioſeph knewe not Marye tyll ſhe had borne her fyrſt ſonne, ergo ſhe bare the ſeconde or he knewe her after, I wyll not forgeue the tyll I be dede or whyle I leue▪ ergo I wyll do it after my dethe / and a thouſande lyke.
            
            
               
                  Ye haue harde howe it was ſayd to them of olde tyme / commyt not adultery.

But I ſay to you / that who ſo euer loketh on a wyfe luſtynge after her / hath cōmitted aduoutrye with her all redy in hys harte.
               
               This commaundement commytte none adulterye had the phareſeys blynded and corrupte with theyr ſophyſtry and leuen / interpretynge the concupyſcence of the harte / lewde toyes / fylthye geſtures / vnclene wordes, clappynge, keſſynge and ſo forthe / not to be imputed for ſyn. But euen the acte and dede alone, thoughe Noyſes ſay in the texte / thou ſhal not couet thy neyghboures wyfe, &c. But Chryſt putteth to lyght and ſalt, and bryngeth the precept to hys true vnderſtandynge and naturall taſte agayne and condemneth the rote of ſynne, the concupyſcence and conſent of the harte. Before the worlde I am no murtherer tyll I haue kylled with myne hande. But before God I kyll, yf I hate, ye yf I loue not, and of loue kepe me both from doynge hurte, and alſo be redye and prepared to helpe at nede. Euen ſo the conſent of the harte with all other menes that folowe ther of / be as well aduoutrye before God / as the dede it ſelfe. Fynally I am an aduouterer before God / yf I ſo loue not my neyghbour, that verye loue forbyd me to couet hys wyfe,Loue is the fulfyllynge of the lawe Loue is the fulfyllynge of al cōmaundementes. And without loue it is impoſſyble to abſtayne from ſynnyng agaynſt my neyghbour in any precept yf occaſyon be gyuen.
               
                  Carnall loue wyl not ſuffer a mother to robbe her chylde / no it maketh her robbe her ſelfe / to make it ryche. A naturall father ſhall neuer luſt after hys ſonnes wyfe. No / he careth more for her chaſtyte then hys ſon doth hym ſelfe. Euen ſo wolde loue to my neyghboure, kepe me frō ſynnynge agaynſte hym.
               
                  Aduoutry.Aduoutry is a damnable thynge in the ſyght of God, and moche meſchefe foloweth therof. Dauid to ſaue his honoure was dreuen to commytte greuous murther alſo. It is vnryght in the ſyght of God and man that thy chyld ſhuld be at another wannes coſt and be another mannes hayre. Neyther canſte thou or the mother haue lyghtly a quyet conſcyence to God / or a mery harte ſo longe as it is ſo. Moreouer what greater ſhame canſt thou do to thy neyghbour, or what greater dyſpleaſure? what yf it neuer be knowen nor come any chylde therof? The precyouſeſt gyfte that a man hath in this world of God, is the true harte of hys wyfe, to abyde by hym in welthe and wo, and to bere all fortunes with hym. Of that haſt thou robbed hym for after ſhe had once coupled her ſelfe to the ſhe ſhal not lyghtly loue him any more ſo truly but haply hate hī and procure his deth. More ouer thou haſte vntaught her to feare God and haſt made her to ſyn agaynſt God. For to God promyſed ſhe and not to man only / for ye lawe of matrymony is Godes ordynaunce. For it is wrytten Ge. 39. when Puthyphars wyfe wold haue had Ioſeph to lye with her, he anſwered / 

howe could I do thys wykednes & ſyn agaynſt God, ye verely it is impoſſyble to ſyn agaīſt mā except thou ſyn againſt God firſt. Finally rede Cronycles and ſtoryes / and ſee what hath folowed of aduoutrye.
               what ſhal we ſay, that ſome doctores haue dyſputed and douted, whether ſyngle fornycacyō ſhuld be ſyn
                     •
                   when it is condempned bothe by Chriſt & Moſes to, and Paule teſtefieth. 1. Cor. 6. that no fornycatoure or whore keper ſhall poſſeſſe the kyngdome of God. It is ryght that al men that hope in God, ſhulde brynge vppe theyr frute in the fere and knowledge of God, and not to leaue hys ſede where he careth not what come therof.
            
            
               
                  Wherfore if thy ryght eye offende the plucke it out and caſte it from the. For it is better for the that one of thy membres peryſhe / then that thy hole bodye ſhulde be caſte into hell. And euen ſo if thy ryght hande offende the / cut it of / and caſte it from the. For it is better for the / that one of thy members peryſhe / then that thy hole bodye ſhulde be caſte into hell.
               
               Thys is not mente of the outwarde members For then we muſt cut of noſe, eares, hande and

fote / ye we muſt procure to deſtroy the ſaynge herynge, ſmellynge, taſtynge and felynge, and ſo euery man kyl him ſelfe. But it is a phraſe or ſpeache of the Ebrue tonge / and wyll that we cut of occaſyons / daunſynge / kyſſyng / ryotous eatynge / Fylthye, and drynkynge / and the luſte of the hart and fylthy ymagynacyons that moue a mā to concupyſcence. Let euery man haue his wyfe thynke her the fayreſt and the beſt cōdicyoned and euery woman her huſbande ſo to. For god hath bleſſed thy wyfe and made her without ſyn to the / A wyfe how good a thynge. whiche ought to ſeme a beautyful fayrnes, And al that ye ſuffer to gether / ye one with the other / is bleſſed alſo and made the verye Croſſe of Chryſte and pleſaunt in the ſyghte of God / why ſhulde ſhe then be lothe ſome to the becauſe of a lytle ſufferynge, that thou ſhuldeſt luſte after a nother / that ſhuld defyle thy ſoule and flee thy cōſcyence and make the ſuffer euerlaſtynglye?
            
            
               
                  It is ſayde / whoſoeuer put away hys wyfe / let hym gyue her a teſtymonyal of the deuorcement. But I ſaye vnto you / who ſo euer putteth away his wyfe (except it be for fornycacyō) maketh her to breke wedlocke / and whoſo euer maryeth the deuorced / breketh wedlocke.
               
               
                  Moyſes Deut. 24.Ryght eye. permytted his Iſraelites in extreme neceſſyte, as whē they ſo hated theyr wyues that they abhorred the companye of thē then to put them awaye,Ryght hād to auoyde a worſe inconuenyence, wherof ye rede alſo Nath. xix. And he knytte therto that they myght not receyue them agayne after they hade ben knowen of any other perſones, which lycence the Iewes abuſed and put awaye theyr wyues for euerye lyght or fayned cauſe, and when ſo euer they luſteth. But Chryſte calleth backe agayne and enterpreteth the lawe after the fyrſt ordynaūce and cutteth of all cauſes of deuorcement, ſaue fornycacion of the wyues party, when ſhe breketh her matrymony. In whiche caſe Moyſes lawe pronounceth her dede, & ſo do the lawes of many othercontres, which lawes where they be vſed, there is the man free without all queſtyon. Nowe where they be let lyue / there the man (if he ſee ſygne of repentaunce and amendement) maye forgeue for once. If he may not fynde in hys hart (as Ioſeph as holye as he was coulde not fynde in hys harte to take Chryſtes mother to hym, when he ſpyed hyr with chyld) he is fre no dout to take another whyle ye lawe interpreteth her dede, for her ſyn ought of no ryght to bynde hym.
               what ſhal the woman do, yf ſhe repent and be ſo tempted in her fleſhe that ſhe cā not leue chaſte? verely I can ſhewe you nothynge out of the ſcrypture. The offyce of the preacher is, to preache the, x. commaundementes whiche are

the lawe natural,The offyce of a preacher. and to promyſe them whiche ſubmytte them ſelues to kepe them of loue and feare of God, euerlaſtyng lyfe for their labour through faythe in Chryſte / and to threaten the dyſobedyent with euerlaſtynge payne in hell. And this ponyſhment is. yf any man haue offended throught fraltye, and when he is rebuked turne and repente, to receyue hym into grace and abſolue hym, and yf any wyll not amende when he is rebuked / to caſt him out among the infydeles. Thys I faye yf the temporall power ſhut her vp, as a conuicte perſon appoyntynge her a ſober lyuynge / to make ſatyſfaccyon to the congregacyon for her dampnable exſample, they dyd not a myſſe. It is better that one myſdoer ſuffer then a comen welthe to de corrupte.
               where the officers be neglygent and the woman not able to put herſelfe to penaunce, if ſhe went where ſhe is not knowen and there mary God is the God of mercye. If any man in the ſame place where ſhe treſpaſeth, petyed her & maryed her. I coulde ſuffer it. were it not that the lyberty wolde be the next way to prouoke all othar that were once wery of theyr huſbandes / to commytte adulterye, for to be deuorſed from them / that they myght marye other whiche they loued better. Lette the temporall ſwerde take hede to their charge therfore. For thys is truth,Law / what foloweth the keping of the lawe all the temporall bleſſynges ſet in the lawe of Moyſes for kepyng theyr lawes / as welthe and proſperyte / longe lyfe / the vpper

As it ſemeth them not good, or as they had no luſt / or as they admytted it not, nor alowed for ryght in theyr hertes to knowe God as God, to gyue hym the honour of God / that is, to feare hym as God, and as auenger of all euel, and to ſeke hys wyll, euen ſo God gaue them vp to folowe theyr owne blyndenes, and toke hys ſpyryte and his grace from them / and wolde no lenger rule theyr wyttes. Euen ſo yf we caſte of vs the yocke of our temporall lawes whiche are the lawes of God and dreuen out of the .10. commaundementes and lawe naturall / and out of loue thy neyghboure as thy ſelfe. God ſhal caſt vs of and lette vs ſlyppe, to folowe our owne wytte. And then ſhall all go agaynſte vs / what ſo euer we take in hande, in ſo moch that when

we gather a perlyament to reforme or amende ought / that we there determe ſhalbe our owne ſnare / confuſion, and vtter deſtruccyon. ſo that all the enemyes we haue vnder heauen coulde not wyſhe vs ſo greate myſchefe as our owne councell ſhall do vs, God ſhall ſo blynde the wyſdome of the wyſe. If any man haue any godlye councell, it ſhall haue none audyence, Erroure / madnes and daunſynge ſhal haue the vpper hande.
               And let the ſpyrytualty take hede and loke wel about them and ſee whether they walke as they haue promyſed god,An admonycyon. and in the ſteppes of his ſonne Chryſt and of his apoſtles whoſe offyces they bere, For I promyſe them / all the deuelles in hell / if God had let them all lowſe▪ coulde not haue gyuen them worſe counſell / then they haue gyuen them ſelues thys .xx. yere longe.

And let the temporaltye remember, that becauſe thoſe nacyōs vnder which the Iſraelites were in capteuyte, dyd deale cruelly with them, not to ponyſhe them for theyr ydolatrye and ſyn whiche

               But to our purpoſe / what yf the man ronne from hys wyfe and let her ſette. Verely the rulers ought to make a law / if any do ſo & come not agayne by a certayne daye / as within the ſpace of a yere or ſo that then he be banyſhed the contry / and yf he come agayne, to come on his hede, and let the wyfe be fre to mary where ſhe wyll. For what ryght is it that a lewde wretch ſhulde take his goodes and ronne from his wyfe without a cauſe and ſytte by an whore ye and come agayne after a yere or two (as I haue knowen it) and robbe his wyfe of that ſhe hath gotten in the meane tyme / and go agayne to hys whore? Paule ſayth to the Corinthyans. that if a man or woman be coupled with an infydell / and the infydel depart, the other is free to mary where they luſt. And .1.

                  Swerynge.As to hate in the harte, or to couet another mannes wyfe / was no ſynne with the phareſeys, no more was it to hyde one thynge in the harte and to ſpeake another with the mouthe, to deceyue a mannes neyghbour / yf it were not bounde with an othe. And thoughe Moyſes ſay Leuitici. xix. Lye not nor deceyue any man hys neyghboure or one another, yet they interpreted it but good councell / yf a man deſyred to be perfecte. But no precepte to bynde vnder payne of ſynne. And ſo by that meanes not onelye they that ſpake true / but alſo they that lyed to deceyue, were compelled to ſwere and to confyrme theyr wordes with othes, yf they wolde be beleued.
               But Chryſte bryngeth lyght and ſalt to the texte whiche the phareſeys had darkened and corrupte with the ſtynkyngemyſte of theyr ſophyſtry,To ſwere by God. and forbyddeth to ſwere at all▪ eyther by God or any creature of Goddes, for thou canſt ſwere by none othe at al, excepte the dyſhonoure ſhal redowne vnto the name of God. If thou ſwere, by God it is ſo, or by God I wyl do this or that, the meanynge is, that thou makeſt God iudge, to auenge it of the, yf it be not as thou ſayeſt, or yf thou ſhalte not do as thou promyſeſt. Nowe if truth be not in thy wordes thou ſhameſte thyne heuenlye father, and teſtyfyeſt that thou beleueſt that he is no ryghtwyſe iudge nor wyll aduenge vnryghtwyſnes / but that he is wycked as thou arte and conſenteth and laugheth at the / whyle thou deceyueſt thy

brother, aſwell created after the lykenes of God and ſo deare bought with the precyous bloude of Chriſt as thou. And thus through the a wycked ſonne is the name of thy father dyſhonoured, and his lawe not fered nor hys promyſes beleued. And when thou ſwereſte by the goſpell boke or byble, the meanynge is, that God yf thou lye. ſhall not fulfyll vnto the, the promyſes of mercye therin wrytten. But contrarye wyſe to brynge vp on the all the curſſes / plages / and vengeaunce therin thretened vnto the dyſobedyent and euell doers. And euen ſo whē thou ſwereſt by any creature, as by breade or ſalte. the meanynge is, that thou deſyreſte / that the creator therof ſhall aduenge it of the, yf thou lye. &c̄. wherfore our dealynge ought to be ſo ſubſtancyal that our wordes myght be beleued without an othe. Our wordes are the ſignes of the truth of our hartes, ī which ought to be pure and ſīgle loue toward thy brother, for what ſo euer procedeth not of loue is damnable. Nowe falſhed to deceyue hym and pure loue can not ſtande together. It cā not therfore be but dampnable ſyn to deceyue thy brother with lyenge, thoughe thou adde no othe to thy wordes. Moche more dampnable is it then to deceyue and to adde an othe therto. &c̄.
               Howe be it al maner of ſweryng is not here forboden, no more then all maner of kyllyng.Swerynge. when the commaundement ſayth, kyll not / for iudges and rulers muſte kyll. Euen ſo ought they, when they put anye man in offyce, to take

an othe of hym that he ſhall be true and faythfull and dylygent therin. And of theyr ſubiectes it is lawefull to take othes, and of all that offer them ſelues to beare wytnes. But yf the ſuperior wolde compell the inferior, to ſwere that ſhulde be to the dyſhonour of God or hurtynge of an innocent, the inferior ought rather to dye then to ſwere. Nether ought a iudge to compel a man to ſwere agaynſt hym ſelfe, that he make hym not ſynne and for ſwere whereof it is ynough ſpoken in another place. But here is forboden ſweryng betwene neyghbour and neyghboure, and in all our pryuate buſyneſſe and dayly communycacyon. For cuſtomable ſweringe, thoughe we lyed not, doth robbe the name of God of hys due reuerence and feare. And in our dayly communicacyon and buſynes one with another is ſo moch vanyte of wordes that we can not but of many thynges lye, which to cōfyrme with an othe, though we begyle not is to take the name of God in vayne and vnreuerently agaynſte the ſeconde precepte. Nowe to lye for the intent to begyle / is dampnable of it ſelfe / howe moch more then to abuſe the holye name of God therto, and to cal to God for vengeaunce vp on thyne owne ſelfe.
               
                  Charite moderateth ye lawe.Many caſes yet there chaunce dayly betwene man and man, in whiche charyte compelleth to ſwere, as I knowe that my neyghboure is faſly ſcalundered, I am bounde to reporte the truth and may lawfully ſwere, ye and am bounde if it nede, and that thoughe nat before a iudge.

And vnto the weake where ye and naye haue loſte theyr credence thorowe the multytude of lyers,Othe. To performe an euell othe is double ſynne. a man maye lawefully ſwere to put them out of doute. whiche yet cometh of the euell of them that abuſe theyr language to deceyue with all. Fynally to ſwere to do euel is dampnable, and to performe that is double dampnable. Herodes othe made hym not innocent and gylties of the dethe of Iohan the Baptyſte thoughe the ypocryte had not knowen what his wyfes doughter wolde haue aſked. And when men ſaye, a kynges worde muſte ſtande / that is trouth, yf his othe or promyſe be lawfull and expedyent.
               In al our promyſes it is to be added, if God wyll and yf there be no lawful let. And though it be not added, it is to be interprete, as added As yf I borowe thy ſwerde, and by the houre I promyſe to brynge it yt agayne, thou be beſyde thy ſelfe. If I promyſe to paye by a certayne daye, and be in the meane tyme robbed or decayed by chaunce that I can not perfourme it. I am not forſworne yf myne herte ment truely when I promyſed. And many lyke caſes there be of whiche are touched in other places. To lye alſo and to dyſſemble is not alwaye ſynne. Dauid. 1, Regum. 27.

                  Chryſt here entēdeth not to diſanul the temporall regyment, and to forbyd rulers to punyſhe euell doers, no more then he ment to deſtroy matrymony when he forbade to luſt and couet another mannes wyfe in thy harte. But as he there forbade, that defyleth matrymonye, euē ſo he forbeddeth here yt which troubleth, vnquyeteth and deſtroyeth the temporal regyment, and that thynge whiche to forbydde, the temporal regyment was ordyned which is that no man aduenge hym ſelfe.
               Chriſt medleth not with the temporal regyment. But in al this lōge ſermō fyghteth againſt the phareſeys falſe doctryne and ſalteth the law, to purge it of the corrupcion of their fylthy gloſes, and to brynge it vnto ye ryght taſt and true vnderſtandynge agayne.
               For the phareſeys had ſo enterpret that lawe of Moyſes (which partayned only vnto the rulers) that euery pryuat perſon myght adueng hym ſelfe, and do his aduerſary as moch harme agayne as he had receyued of hym.
               Nowe if he that is angry haue deſerued that then pronounce dethe vpon hym, and he that ſayeth Racha hath deſerued that men ſhuld rather a councell to determyne ſome ſundry and cruel deth for ſo haynouſe a cryme, and he that calleth his brotherfole, haue deſerued hel what deſerueth he yt ſmyteth or aduengeth him ſelfe with his owne hand. Here is forboden therfore pryuate wrathe onely, and that a man aduenge hym ſelfe.
               
                  
                  Cheke. To turne. the other cheke what it is. To turne the other cheke is maner of ſpeakynge and not to be vnderſtande as the wordes ſounde as was to cutte of the hande and to plucke out the eye. And as we commaunde our chyldren not onely not to come nye a brooke or a water, but alſo not ſo herdye as once to loke that waye▪ eyther to loke on fyer or once to thynke on fyer, whiche are impoſſyble to be obſerued. More is ſpoken then ment to feare them and to make them perceyue that it is erneſt that we comaūde. Euen ſo is the meanynge here that we in no wyle aduenge / but be prepared euer to ſuffer as moche more / and neuer to thynke it lawfull to aduenge, howe great ſo euer the iniury be, for he hym ſelfe turned not the other cheke, when he was ſmyten before the byſhope, nor yet Paulus when he was bofetted before the byſhoppe alſo. But ye haue harde a lytle aboue.Mekenes. Bleſſed are the meke, for they ſhall poſſeſſe the erthe. Let all the worlde ſtudye to do the wronge, ye lette them do the wronge, and yet yf thou be meke, thou ſhalte haue fode and rayment ynoughe for the and thyne. And more ouer yf the worſte come, God ſhall yet ſet ſuche a tyraunt ouer the, that (yf thou be meke and canſt be content that he poll the properly,Pollynge howe to aduoyde it. and euen thou mayſte beare) ſhall defende the from al other who is polled intollerably, that hys lyfe is better and euen deathe to hym, ſaue he that is impacyent and can not ſuffer to be polled. Ye, poll thy ſelfe. and preuent other, and gyue the baylly or lyke

offycer nowe a capon, nowe a pygge. nowe a gooſe, and ſo to thy land lorde lykewyſe, or yf thou haue a greate ferme, nowe a lambe / nowe a calfe / and let thy wyfe vyſet thy lande ladye thre or foure tymes in a yere▪ with ſpyſed kakes and apples / perrs / chyreſe and ſuche lyke. And be thou redye with thyne oxen or horſes thre or foure, or halfe a doſſen dayes in a yere to ſet whome theyr woodde or to plowe theyr lande, ye and yf thou haue a good horſe, let thē haue hym good chepe or take a worſe for him, and they ſhalbe thy ſhylde and defende the / though they be tyrantes and care not for God / that no man els ſhal dare poll the. And therto thou mayſt withwyſdome get of them, that ſhal recompence al that thou doyſt to them. All this I meane if thou be pacyent and wyſe and feare God, therto, and loue thyne neyghbour and do none euell, For if thou kepe thy ſelfe in fauour with hurtynge thy neyghbour / thyne ende wyl be euell / and at the laſte deſperacyon in thys worlde and hell after.
               But and yf thou canſt not pol thy ſelfe with wyſdome, and laugh and bere a good countenaunce as though thou reioyſedeſt whyle ſuche perſones poll the, euery man ſhal poll the and they ſhal maynteyne them / and not defēde the. Let thys the fore be a comen prouerbe / be contented to be polled of ſome man / or be polled of euery man.
               Ye muſt vnderſtande that there be two ſtates or degrees in thys worlde / Two maaer ſtates. degrees, of regymētes. the kyngedome

of heuen which in the regyment of the goſpel. And the kyngdome of this worlde which is the temporall regyment. In the fyrſt ſtate there is nether father / mother / ſonne / doughter / neyther mayſter / mayſtres / mayde / man ſeruaunt / nor huſbande nor wyfe / nor lorde or ſubiecte, nor man or woman, but Chyrſte is all, and eche to other is Chryſt hym ſelfe. There is none better then other, but al lyke good, al brethren, & Chriſt only is lord ouer al. Nether is there any other thynge to do or other lawe ſaue to loue one another as Chryſt loued vs. In the tēporal regyment is huſbande / wyfe / father / mother / ſon / doughter / mayſter / mayſtres / mayde / man ſeruant / lorde and ſubiecte,
               
                  Euery man is of ye ſpyrytualty & of the temporaltye bothe.Nowe is euery perſon a double perſon and vnder bothe the regymentes. In the fyrſt regyment thou arte a perſon for thyne owne ſelfe / vnder Chriſt and his doctrine, and mayſt nether hate or be angry and moch les fyght or aduēge But muſte after the enſample of Chryſte vmble thy ſelfe, forſake and denye thy ſelfe, and hate thy ſelfe, and caſt thy ſelfe awaye, and bemeke and pacyent, and let euery man go ouer the▪ and treade the vnder fote and do the wronge, and yet loue them and pray for them, as Chriſt dyd for his crucyfyers. For loue is al and what is not of loue / that is damnable and caſt out of that kyngedome.
               
                  Loue. He that loueth not. his neyghboure hath not the true faythe of Chryſt
                        •
                     .For that kyngdome is the kyngdome of God and Chryſte. But he that loueth not / knoweth nether God nor Chryſt, therfore he that loueth

not is not of that kyngdome. The minor is this wyſe proued / he that knowith God and Chriſt ſeeth lyght, for Chryſt is lyght. But he that hateth hys brother / is in darckenes and walketh in darkenes and wotteth not whyther he goeth for darkenes hathe blynded his eyes. 1. Ioh. 2, Ergo he that hateth his brother / knoweth not what Chryſte hath done for hym, and therfore hath no true fayth / nor is of the ſpyritual kyngdome of God.
               To hate thy ſelfe, hat ſhalt thou gete, if thou conſyder thyne owne ſynnes and depe dampnacyon that longe therto with due repentaunce And to loue that ſhalt thou obtayne if thou beholde the great and infinyte mercy of God with ſtronge fayth. There is none ſo great an enemy to ye in this world. But thou ſhalt lyghtly loue hym if thou loke wel on the loue that God ſhewed the in Chryſte.
               In the temporall regyment thou art a perſon in reſpecte of other, thou art an huſbande / The temporal regimēt father / mother / mayſter / mayſtreſſe / lorde / ruler / or wyfe / ſon / doughter / ſeruaunt / ſubiecte. And there thou mayſte do accordynge to thyne offyce. If thou be a father / thou muſt do the offyce of a father and rule or els thou dampneſt thy ſelfe. Thou muſte brynge all vnder obedyence whether by fayre meanes or foule. Thou muſte haue obedyence of thy wyfe / of thy ſeruauntes / and of thy ſubiectes / and the other muſte obeye. If they wyll not obey with loue, thou muſt chyde and fyght / as farre as the lawe

of God and the lawe of the lande wyll ſuffer the. And when thou canſte not rule them / thou art boūde in many caſes / to delyuer them vnto the hyer offycer of whome thou dydeſt take the charge ouer them.
               
                  Vyolence. Not to reſyſt vyolēce hawe it is vnderſtād.Nowe to our purpoſe, whether a man may reſyſte vyolence and defende or aduenge hym ſelfe. I ſaye naye in the fyrſte ſtate, where thou art a perſone for thy ſelfe alone and Chryſtes dycyple. There thou muſt loue, and of loue do ſtudye and enforce ye and ſuffer all thynge (as Chryſt dyd to make peace / that the bleſſyng of God maye come vpon the / which ſayth. Bleſſed be the peace makers, for they ſhalbe the chyldren of God. If thou ſuffer and kepeſt peas in thy ſelfe onely, the bleſſynge is, the poſſeſſyon of this worlde.

And of thy ſeruauntes thou muſt exacte obedyence and feare, & mayſt

not ſuffer thy ſelfe to be dyſpyſed. And where thou arte a ruler therto appoynted, thou muſte take, pryſon and ſlee to / not of malyce and hate, to aduenge thy ſelfe / but to defende thy ſubiectes, and to maynteyne thyne offyce.
               Concernyng thy ſelfe, oppreſſe not thy ſubiectes with rent, fynes or cuſtome at all, / neyther pylle them with taxes and ſuche lyke / to maynteyne thyne owne luſtes. But be louynge and kynde to them, as Chryſte was to the / for they be hys and the pryce of hys bloude. But thoſe that be euell doers amonge them and vexe theyr brethren, and wyll not knowe the for theyr iudge, and feare thy lawe, thē ſmyte, and vpon them drawe thy ſwerde, and put it not vp vntyll thou haue done thyne offyce, yet without hate to thy perſon for hys maſters ſake and becauſe he is in the fyrſt regyment thy brother / but amende hym onely / or yf it can not be / but that thou muſte loſe one to ſaue many / then execute thyne offyce with ſuche affeccyon / with ſuche compaſſyon and ſorowe of harte, as thou woldeſte cutte of thyne owne arme to ſaue the reſte of thy body.

               Thys texte of hatynge a mannes enemye / ſtandeth not in any one place of the byble / but is gathered of many places in which God commaundeth the chyldren of Iſrael to deſtroye theyr enemyes / the Cananytes / the Amorytes / the Amolekites / and other hethen people / as the Moabites / and Amonytes / whiche ſought to brynge them out of the fauour of God / and to deſtroye the name of God. The Amalekites came behynde them and ſlue al that were fayntye and wery by the waye as they come out of Egypte. The Moabites and Ammonites hyred Balam to curſe them / and begyle thē with their women and made a great plage amonge them. Theſe & lyke nacyons were perpetual enemyes to theyr lande which God had gyuen them, and alſo of ye name of God and of their fayth. For which cauſe they not onely myght lawfully, but were alſo bound to hate thē / and to ſtudy theyr deſtruccion agayne / howe be it they myght not yet hate the ſayed nacyons ſuch as were conuerted to theyr faythe.
               Nowe by the reaſon of ſuch textes as commaunded to hate the comune enemyes of theyr contrye and of God and his lawe, and of theyr

fayth / the pharyſeys doctryne was / that a man myght lawfully hate all hys pryuate enymyes without excepcion, nor was bound to do them good. And yet Moyſes ſayth. Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thyne harte. And agayne thou ſhalt not aduenge thy ſelfe nor bere hate in mynde agaynſt the chyldren of thy people. And yf thyne enemyes aſſe ſynke vnder hys burthen, helpe to lyfte hym vp agayne, and yf hys oxe or aſſe go a ſtraye / brynge them home agayne, which all no doute, the pharyſeys dyd enterprete for good councell, but for no preceptes, wherfore Chryſt ſalteth theyr doctryne and proueth that a man is bounde both to loue and to do good to hys enemye, and as a naturall ſone, though hys brethren be neuer ſo euel yet to loue them and ſhewe them kyndneſſe for hys fathers ſake, and to ſtudye to amende them, what haſt thou to reioyſe of, yf thy relygyon be not better then the religion of theues? For theues loue amonge themſelues,Publycans what they were. and ſo do the couetouſe of the worlde, as the vſurars and publycans, whiche bought in greate the emperoures trybute / and to make theyr moſte aduauntage, dyd ouer ſette the people. Naye, it is not ynough for the to loue thy benefactoures onely / as monkes and freres do, and them of thyne owne cote and order / or the brethren of thyne owne Abbaye onely (for amonge ſome ther loue ſtretcheth no further, and that ſhall he that is remoued out of another cloyſture thyther, well fynde / ye and in ſome places charyte

reacheth not at all the celles of the ſame cloyſture and to all the monkes that were profeſſed in the ſame place.) But lyfte vp thyne eyes vnto thy heuenly father, and as thy father doth ſo do thou loue al thy fathers chyldrē. He mynyſtreth ſonne and rayne to good and badde / by which two vnderſtande all hys benefytes. For of the heate and dryeth of the ſonne and colde and moyſt of the rayne, ſprynge al thynges that are neceſſary to the lyfe of man. Euen ſo prouoke thou and drawe thyne euell brethren to goodnes / with pacyence / with loue in worde and dede / and pray for them to hym that is able to make thē better and to conuerte them. And ſo thou ſhalt be thy fathers natural ſon & perfecte, as he is perfecte. The text ſayth not, ye ſhalbe as perfecte as God. But perfecte after his enſample. To be perfecte ye ſcrypture is not to be a monke or a fryer, or neuer to ſyn. For chryſt teacheth not here monkes or fryers,To be perfecte what it meaneth. but hys dyſcyples and euery Chryſten man and woman. And to be in thys lyfe al to gether without ſyn / is impoſſyble. But to be perfect, is to haue pure doctryne without falſe opinyons / and that thyne hart be to folowe that lernynge.

                     TAke hede to your almoſe / that ye do it not before men / to be ſene of them / or els ye get no rewarde of youre father which is in heuen. Therfore when thou gyueſte almoſe / make not a trompet to be blowen before the / as the ypocrytes do in the ſynagoges and in the ſtreates / to be prayſed of men. Verely I ſay vnto you / they haue theyr rewarde. But thou when thou gyueſt almoſe / let not thy lefte hande knowe what thy ryght hāde doth / that thyne almoſe may be in ſecrete. And then thy father whiche ſeeth in ſecrete / ſhal rewarde the openly.
               
               
                  As he rebuked theyr doctryne aboue, euen ſo here he rebuketh theyr workes, for out of deuelyſhe doctryne can ſprynge no godly workes. But what workes rebuketh he? Verelye ſuch as God in the ſcrypture commaūdeth, and without whiche no man can be a chryſten man / euen prayer faſtynge and almoſe dede. For as the ſcrypture corrupt with gloſes, is no more Goddes worde, euen ſo the dedes cōmaunded in the ſcrypture (when the entent of them is peruerted) are no more godlye dedes. what ſayde the ſcrybes and pharyſeys of hym (thynke ye) when he rebuked ſuche maner of workes? No doute as they ſayde (when he rebuked theyr falſe gloſes) howe he deſtroyed the lawe and the prophetes, interpretyng the ſcripture after the lyterall ſence▪ whiche kylleth, and after hys owne brayne, cleane contrarye to the comune fayth of the holy chyrche and myndes of great clerkes and autentyke expoſycions of olde holye doctoures. Euen ſo here what other coulde they ſaye, then. Beholde the heretyke and dyd not we tell you before wherto he wolde come, and that he kepte ſome myſchefe behynde and ſpued not out all hys venome attonce, ſee to what al his godly newe doctryne that ſounded ſo ſwetly, is come? he preached all of loue, and wolde haue the people ſaued by fayth / ſo longe tyl yt nowe at the laſt, he preached clene agaynſt all dedes of mercy, as prayer / faſtynge and almoſe dede, and deſtroyeth al good workes.

they deſpyce theyr dyuyne ſeruyce and come not to churche, ye and yf the holyeſt of al ſaynt Fraunces order axe them almes / they byd hym laboure with his handes and gete hys lyuynge, and ſaye that he that laboureth not is not worthy to eate / and that God bade that no ſuche ſtronge loboures ſhulde loyter and go a beggynge and be chargeable to the congregacyon and eate vp that other pore men gete with the ſwete of theyr bodies / ye and at the laſt ye ſhal ſee / yf we reſyſte him not be tymes / that he ſhal moue the people to inſurreccyon / as Cayphas ſayd / and the Romaynes ſhall come and take our lande from vs. As ye ſe in the texte Luke 13. Howe (when they coulde not dryue ye people from hym with theſe perſuaſyons) they accuſed hym to Pylate ſayenge, we haue founde thys felowe peruertyng the people and forbyddyng to pay trybute to Ceſar / and ſaynge that he is Chryſte a kynge, wherfore thou canſt not be Ceſars frend,Iohan. 16. yf thou let hī eſcape.

               Chriſt here deſtroyeth not prayer, faſtynge, and almoſe dede. But preacheth agaynſte the falſe purpoſe and entent of ſuche workes and peruertynge the true vſe / that is to ſaye / theyr ſekynge of glorye / and that they eſtemed them ſelues righteouſe therby and better then other

men, and ſo deſpyſed and condempned theyr brethren. with our almoſe which is as moch to ſay as dedes of mercye or cōpaſſyon / we ought to ſeke our fathers glory onely, euen the welth of our brethren and to wyn them to the knowledge of our father and kepynge of hys lawe. He that ſeketh the glorye of hys good workes, ſeketh the glorye that belongeth to God / and maketh hym ſelfe God. Is it not a blynd thyng of the world / that eyther they wyl do no good workes at all / or wyll be God for theyr good workes and haue the glorye them ſelues.

So that the very menynge / both that we blowe no trompettes and that the lefte hande knowe not what the ryght hande dothe, is that we do as ſecretly as we can / and in no wyſe ſeke glorye / or to receyue it / yf it were profered.

                   fyrſte there is ynoughe ſpoken therof in other places, ſo that to them that haue red that, it is

ſuperfluouſe to reherſe the matter agayne. Furthermore the argument is nought and holdeth by no rule. See ye not that the father and mother haue more ryght to the chylde and to al it can do, thā to an oxe or a cowe. It is theyr fleſhe and bloude, nouryſhed vp with theyr laboure and coſt. The lyfe of it and the mayntenaunce and countenaunce therof is theyr benefyte / ſo that it is not able to recōpence that it oweth to father and mother by a thouſand partes. And though it be not able to do hys duety nor for blyndnes to knowe hys duety / yet the father and mother promyſe more gyftes ſtyll without ceaſynge, and that ſuch as they thynke ſhuld moſt make it to ſee loue and to prouoke it to be wyllynge to do parte of his duety, And when it hathe done amyſſe, thoughe it haue no power to do ſatyſfaccyon, nor luſt or courage to com to the ryght way agayne, yet theyr loue and mercye abydeth ſtyll ſo greate to it, that vpon a poyntment of mendinge, they not only forgeue that is paſte and fulfyll theyr promyſe not the later / but promyſe greater gyftes then euer before, and to be better father and mother to it then euer they were. Nowe when it can not do the thouſande parte of hys duety, howe coude it deſerue ſuche promyſes of the father and mother / as a labourer dothe his hyer? the reward therfore cometh of the loue, mercy and truthe of the father and mother as wel when the chylde kepeth the apoyntment, as when they fulfyll theyr promyſe, when it hath broken the

appoyntment / and not of the deſeruinge of the chylde.
               Euen ſo yf we were not thus drowned in blyndeneſſe, we ſhulde eaſely ſee / that we can not do the thouſande parte of our dutye to God, no though there were no lyfe to come. If there were no lyfe to come it were not ryght that I ſhulde touche any creature of God, otherwyſe then he hath apoynted. Though there were no lyfe to come, it had neuertheles ben ryght that Adam hade abſtayned from the forboden aple tree / and from all other to, if they had ben forboden. Ye & though there were no lyfe to com it were not the leſſe ryght that I loued my brother and forgaue hym to day, ſeynge I ſhal ſyn agaynſte hym to morowe. Becauſe a father can not gyue his chyldrē heuen / hath he no power to charge them to loue one another and to forgyue and not aduenge one another? And hathe he not ryght to bete them. yf they ſmyte eche other, becauſe he can not gyue them heuen? A boundeman that hathe a mayſter more cruell then a reaſonable man wolde be to a dogge / if there were no heuen / myght thys bounde ſeruaunt accuſe God of vnryghtwyſnes / bycauſe he hathe not made hym a mayſter? Nowe then when we can not do our duetye by a thouſande partes, though there were no ſuch promyſes / & that the thinge cōmaunded is no leſſe our duety though no ſuch promyſe were, it is eaſy to perceyue that the reward promyſed cometh of the goodes, mercye and truthe of the promyſer to

make vs the gladder to do our duetye / and not of the deſeruinge of the receyuer, when we haue done al that we cā, we ought to 
                     •
                  ay in our harte that it was our duety and that we ought to do a thouſande times more, and that God (if he had not promyſed vs mercye of hys goodneſſe in Chryſt) he myght yet of ryght damme vs for yt we haue lefte vndone.
               And as touchynge forgyuenes of ſynne, though forgyuenes of ſynne be promyſed vnto the / yet chalenge it not by thy merytes / but by the merytes of Chryſtes bloude, and heare what Paule ſaythe Phylyppenſes. 3. Concernynge the ryghtwyſnes of the lawe, I was fautleſſe or ſuch as no mā could rebuke. But ye thynges that were to vauntage, I thought damage for Chryſtes ſake ye / I thynke all thynge to be damage or loſſe, for the excellent knowledges ſake of Chryſt Ieſus my lorde, for whoſe ſake I let all go to loſſe, and counte them as chaffe or refuſe (that is to ſaye, as thynges whiche are purged out and refuſed when a thynge is tryed and made perfecte) that I myght wynne Chryſt and myght be founde in hym / not hauynge my ryghtwyſnes that cometh of the lawe. But that whiche cometh of fayth in Chryſte Ieſu / whiche ryghtwyſneſſe cometh of God thorough fayth / and is to knowe hym and the power of hys reſurreccyon (howe he is lord ouer al ſyn▪ and the only thynge that ſleyeth and vanqueſheth ſyn) and to knowe alſo the felowſhyp of his paſſyons that I myght be made lyke vnto his dethe.

So that when ryghtwyſneſſe and true merytes be tryed, we muſte be content that ours be the chaffe and Chryſtes the pure corne / oures the ſkome and refuſe, and Chryſtes the pure golde And we muſt faſhyō aur ſelues lyke vnto Chriſt and take euery man his croſſe and ſlee and mortefye the ſynne in the fleſhe,Croſſe. or els we can not be partakers of his paſſyon, The ſynne we do before our conuerſyon is forgyuen clerly thorough fayth if we repent and ſubmyt our ſelues to a newe lyfe. And the ſynne we do agaynſt

                   our wylles (I meane the wyl of the ſpyryte fo

And our dylygence in workynge kepeth vs from ſynnynge agayne and mynyſheth the ſyn that remayneth in the fleſhe and maketh vs pure and leſſe apte and dyſpoſed to ſynne, and it maketh vs mery in aduerſytes and ſtronge in temptacyons and bolde to go in to God with a ſtronge and feruent fayth in our prayers / and ſure that we ſhal be harde when we crye for helpe at nede / eyther for our ſelues or our brethren, Nowe they that be neglygent and ſynne / are brought in temptacyon vnto the poynte of deſperacyon and fele the very paynes of hell, ſo that they ſtande in doute whether God hathe caſte them away or no. And in aduerſyte they be ſorowful and dyſcouraged and thynke that God is angrye and ponyſheth them for theyr ſynnes.

when a chylde taketh payne to do hys father pleaſure and is ſure that he ſhall haue thanke and rewarde of hys laboure, he is mery and reioyſeth in hys worke and payne that he ſuffreth / and ſo is the aduerſyte of them that kepe them ſelues from ſynnynge. But a chylde when he is beten for hys faute, or when he thynketh his father is angrye and loue hym not, is anone deſperat and dyſcouraged, ſo is the aduerſyte of them that are weake and ſyn ofte. A chylde that neuer dyſpleſeth hys father, is bolde in hys fathers preſence to ſpeake for hym ſelfe or hys frende. But he that oft offendeth and is correcte or chydde, thoughe the peace be made agayne, yet the remembraunce of hys offēces maketh hym fearefull and to myſtruſt & to thynke his father wolde not heare hym / ſo is the fayth of the weake that ſynne ofte.Promyſe. he that profeſſeth not a newe lyfe hathe no promiſe of mercye in Chryſte. But as for them that profeſſe not a newe lyuynge howe euer ſo moch they dreame of fayth▪ they haue no fayth at al, for they haue no promyſe, except they be cōuerted to a newe lyfe. And therfore in aduerſytes, temptacyon & deth, they vtterly dyſpare of all mercy and peryſhe.
            
            
               
                  And when thou prayeſt / thou ſhalt not be lyke the ypocrytes. For they loue to ſtande & pray in the ſynagoges & in corners of the ſtretes / that they myght be ſene of men. Verely

                     The Pater noſter is expounded.O our father whiche art in heuen.
               
               Fyrſt muſt thou go to hym as a mercyful father whiche of his owne goodnes and fatherly loue yt he bereth to the, is redy to do more for the than thou canſt deſyre, though thou haue no merytes. But becauſe he is thy father / onely yf thou wylte turne and hensforthe ſubmytte thy ſelfe to lerne to do his wyll.
            
            
               
                  
                     To honour gods name what it is.Honoured be thy name.
               
               Honoured and prayſed be thy name or honoured and prayſed be thou, for to honoure God and to honoure the name of God is all one. And to honoure the name of God is, to dreade hym to loue hym and to kepe hys commaundementes. For when a chylde obeyeth his father, he honoreth and prayſeth his father and when he is rebellyous and dyſobedient, he dyſhonoreth his father. This is then the vnderſtandynge and meanyng of it. O father / ſeynge thou art father ouer al / powre out thy ſpyryte vpon al fleſhe / and make all men to feare and drede & loue the as their father, and in kepyng thy commaundementes to honoure the and thy holy name.
            
            
               
                  Thy kyngdome come.
               
               That is, ſeyng thou art kynge ouer al, make all to knowe the and make the kynges and rulers which are but thy ſubſtitutes, to cōmaunde

nothynge but accordynge to thy worde / and to them make all ſubiectes obey.
            
            
               
                  Thy wyl befulfylled in erthe / as it is in heuen.
               
               This is al one with that goeth before. For as muche then as thou art father and kyng ouer all, and all we thy chyldren and brethren amonge our ſelues, make vs all as obedyent to ſeke and to do thy wyll as the aungelles do in heuen. Make that no mā ſeke his owne wyl but all thyne. But and yf thou withdrawe thyne hande to tempte thy chyldren, that the rulers commaunde ought contrarye to thy wyll / then make the ſubiectes to ſtande faſt by thy worde and to offer them ſelues to ſuffer all extremyte, rather then to obey. Fynally when we pray to the in our tēptacions and aduerſites deſirynge the of what ſo euer thynge it be, & meane truely yet yf thou that knoweſt al, ſeyſt a better waye to thy glorye and our profyte, then they wylbe and not oures. As thy ſon Ieſus gaue vs an enſample / whē he deſyred (if it had ben poſſible) that / that cuppe of better deth myght haue deperted from hym ſayenge, yet not as I wyl, but as thou wylt.
            
            
               
                  Gyue vs our dayly breade.
               
               By breade is vnderſtande al maner of fuſty naunce in the Ebrue ſpeche / ye and here is vnderſtande

therby all that pertayned vnto the neceſſyte of thys lyfe. If we haue bread there is dearth of nothyng that can pynche / namely in that lande. Gyue vs our dayly breade. Gyue vs all that the neceſſyte of thys lyfe dayly requyreth. Gyue it vs day by daye, as we nede it. we deſyre not to haue ſtore for many yeres, to exclude all neceſſyce of prayenge to the, and to be as it were out of thy daunger, and to forget the. But mynyſter it day by daye, that we maye daylye fele thy benefytes and neuer forget the. Or if thou gyue vs aboundaunce aboue that we deſyre, then gyue vs an harte to vſe it and to beſtowe it for that purpoſe thou gaueſt it and to deale with our neyghboures, & not to loue it inordynatly, but to thynke that it is thyne, and that thou mayſt take it awaye euery howre and that we be content that thou ſo do at thy pleaſure, and ſo euer to haue it but for daylye breade.
            
            
               
                  Forgyue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgyue our treſpaſſers.
               
               Becauſe he knoweth that our nature is ſo weake that we can not but ſynne dayly, therfore he teacheth vs daylye to repent and to reconſyle our ſelues to gether / and dayly to axe God forgyuenes. Seynge he commaundeth vs to axe, we maye be bolde ſo to do, and to beleue that he wyll forgeue vs. No man therfore nedeth to deſpare that can repent and axe forgyuenes, howe euer ſo depe he hathe ſynned.

And me thynketh, yf we loked a lytle nere vpō thys texte, we neaded not to make the pope ſo great a God for his perdons. For Chriſt (which is a man to be beleued) ſheweth vs here a more ſure way, ye and that a ſenſyble way which we maye fele that we be perdoned and our ſynnes forgyuen. we can haue none experyence of the popes thynges whether they be ſo or no. He can with al his perdons delyuer no man of any purgatorye that God putteth vs vnto in thys worlde. He can not bleſſe or heale any man ſo moche as of a pore ague or tothe ache. whiche deſeaſes yet by hys owne confeſſyon God putteth on vs to purge vs from ſynne. But where we can not ſee / fele / or haue any experyence at all, that it ſo is, there is he myghtye. If I were come whome out of a lande where neuer man was before, and were ſure neuer man ſhulde come, I myght tel as many wonders as mayſter More doth of Vtopia, and no man coulde rebuke me.
               But here Chriſt maketh the ſure of perdon, for yf thou canſt forgyue thy brother / god hath bounde hym ſelfe to forgyue the, what if no mā haue ſynned agaynſte me? That were harde in this lyfe, neuertheles yet yf that profeſſyon be in thyne harte / that thou knoweſt that it is thy duetye to forgyue thy brother for thy fathers ſake / and art obedyent to thy fathers ordynaunce / and woldeſt forgyue, yf any of thy brethren had offended the and dyd axe the forgiuenes. Then haſt thou that ſame ſpirite which

which God deſyreth to be in the. Marke what Chryſt ſayth aboue in the begynnynge of the .5 chapter. Bleſſed be the mercyfull / for they ſhal haue mercy / doeſte thou pety thy brethren that ſyn, and doeſt thy beſt to amēde thē, that thy fathers name may be honored. Then haſt thou yf wherby thou art ſure of mercy as ſone as thou deſyreſt it. And agayne. Bleſſed be the peace makers for they ſhalbe Goddes chyldren. Lo, yf there be any varyaūce among thy brethren, that one haue offended the other, do thy beſte to ſet them at one, and thou haſt the ſame thynge that God deſyreth of the / for which he hath bounde hym ſelfe to forgyue the.
            
            
               
                  Leade vs nat into temptacyon.
               
               That is. Let vs not ſlyppe out of thy leafe, but holde vs faſte, gyue vs not vp nor ceaſe to gouerne vs, nor take thy ſpirite frō vs. For as an hounde can not but folowe his game when he ſeyth it before him yf he be lowſe, ſo can we not but fall into ſynne when occaſyon is gyuen vs, yf thou withdrawe thyne hande from vs. Leade vs not into temptacyon. Let no temptacyon fall vpon vs, greater then thyne helpe in vs. But be thou ſtronger in vs than the temptacyon thou ſendeſte or letteſte come vppon vs. Leade vs not into tēptacyons. Father though we be neglygent, ye and vnthankful, and dyſobedyent to thy true prophetes / yet let not the dyuell lowſe vpon vs to deceyue vs with hys

falſe prophetes and to harden vs in the waye, in which we gladly walke, as thou dydeſt Pharao with the falſe myracles of hys ſorſerars, as thyne Apoſtle Paule threateneth vs. 2. The. 2. A lytle threde holdeth a ſtronge man where he gladly is. A lytle pullyng draweth a man whether he gladly goeth. A lyght wynde dryueth a greate ſhyppe with the ſcreme. A lyght perſuaſyon is ynoughe to make a lecherous man beleue that fornycacyon is no ſynne. And an angrye man that it is lawful to aduenge him ſelfe, and ſo forth by all the corrupt nature of man. A lytle myracle is able to confirme and harden a man in that openyon and faythe whiche hys blynde reaſon beleueth all redye. A fewe falſe myracles were ynoughe to perſuade the couetouſnes of Pharao and hys gredynes to holde the chyldren of Iſrael in bondage for theyr ſeruyce, that thy true myracles ſhewed by Moyſes for theyr delyueraunce / were not of the. But of the ſame kynde and done by the ſame crafte / as were the myracles of hys ſorſerars, and ſo to harden his harte.
               Euen ſo father yf thou gyue vs ouer for our vnkyndeneſſe / ſeynge the blynde nature of man delyteth in euell / and is ready to beleue lyes, a lytle thynge is ynoughe to make them that loue not to walke in thy truthe (and therfore neuer able to vnderſtande thy ſonnes doctryne. Iohan. 7) for to beleue the faynynges of our moſt holy father, al is ſuperſtycyous popetry and inuyſyble bleſſynges / and to harden

them therin. As a ſtone caſte vp in to the ayer, can nether go any hyer nether yet there abyde / when the power of the hurler ceaſeth to dryue it. Euen ſo father, ſeynge our corrupt nature can but go downeward

                   onely, and the deuell and the worlde dryueth therto the ſame waye, howe can we procede further in vertue or ſtāde therin, if thy power ceaſe in vs. Leade vs not therfore o mercyfull father into tēptacyon nor ceaſe at any tyme to gouerne vs. Nowe ſeynge the God of al mercy which knoweth thyne infirmite cōmanded the to pray in al temptacion and aduerſite, and hath promyſed to helpe / yf thou truſt in hym, what excuſe is it to ſay, when thou haſt ſynned, I coulde not ſtāde of my ſelfe when his power was ready to helpe the, yf tho

                  But delyuer vs from euell.
               
               Fyrſt (as aboue) let vs not fal into temptacyon. Seconderely, yf we be fallen, as who lyueth and falleth neuer? for neuer to falle were ynough to make a man as euell as Lucyfer, and to beleue that he ſtode by hys owne power. If therfore we be fallen euen to the botome, howe ſo euer depe it be, put in thyne arme after, for it is longe and ſtronge ynough, and plucke vs out agayne. Thyrdly, delyuer vs from euel, and plucke vs out of the fleſhe and the world & the power of the deuel, & put vs in the kyngdome where we be paſt al ieoperdy and where we can not ſynne any more.
            
            
               
               
                  For the kyngdome and the power and the glorye is thyne for euer. So be it.

                  ou only art the kynge, and al other but ſubſtytutes. And becauſe al power is thyne, and all other mennes power but borowed of the, therfore ought all honoure and obedyence to be thyne of ryght as chefe lorde, and none to be gyuen other men, but onely for the offyce they holde of the. Nether ought any creature to ſeke any more in thys worlde, then to be a brother tyl, thou haue put hym in offyce then (yf brotherlynes wyll not helpe / whiche he ought fyrſte to proue) let hym execute thy power. Nether maye any man take auctorite of hym ſelfe, tyll God haue choſen hym / that is to wete▪ tyll he be choſen by the ordynāce that God hath ſet in the worlde to rule it. Fynally no kynge / lorde / mayſter / or what ruler it be, hath abſolute power in this worlde / and is the very thynge whiche he is called. For then they ceaſed to be brethren ſtyl, nether could they ſyn what ſo euer they cōmaunded. But nowe theyr auctoryte is but a lymeted power / which when they trāſgreſſe, they ſyn agaynſt theyr brethren, and ought to reconſile them ſelues to their brethren and to axe forgiuenes, and they are boūd to forgyue.
               Fynally let kynges / rulers / and officers remēber that God is the very kynge / and referre

the honoure that is gyuen to them for theyr offyces ſake / to hym / and vmble them ſelues to hym and knowledge and confeſſe in theyr hartes, that they be but brethren and euen no better before God / then the worſt of theyr ſubiectes. So be it.
            
            
               
                  For yf ye forgyue men theyr fautes your heuenly father ſhall forgyue you alſo. But and yf ye do not forgyue men theyr fautes / no more ſhal your father forgiue your fautes.

But the faythe in Chryſtes bloude and in the promyſes made vs for his ſake, dothe brynge ryghtwyſneſſe into the harte. And the ryghtwyſnes of the harte by fayth, is felt and knowen by the worke. As Peter in the fyrſt of his ſeconde epyſtle commaundeth to do good workes / for to make our vocacyō and election ſure / that we myght fele our fayth, and be certefyed that it is ryght. Eor except a man be proued and tryed, it can not be knowen / nether to hym ſelfe or other men / that he is ryghtwyſe and in the true fayth.

Fayth in Chryſt fyrſt certyfyeth the conſcyence of the forgeuenes of ſynnes, and delyuereth vs from feare of euerlaſtynge dampnacyon / and then bryngeth the loue of God and of hys lawe into the harte, whiche loue is the ryghtwyſnes of the harte. Loue bryngeth good workes in to the members / whiche workes are the outwarde ryghtwyſneſſe and the ryghtwyſneſſe of the members.Loue is ryghtwyſnes. To hate the wyll of God is the vnryghtwyſnes of the harte and cauſeth euell workes whiche are the vnryghtwyſneſſe of the members. As when I hatyd my brother / my tonge ſpake euel, my hādes ſmote and ſo forth To loue is the ryghtwyſneſſe of the harte / and cauſeth good workes whiche are the ryghtwyſnes of the members. As yf I loue my brother and he haue nede of me and be in pouerte, loue wyll make me put myne hande in to my purſſe or almorye and to gyue hym ſome what to refreſh hym. &c. That the loue of God and of his commaundementes is the ryghtwyſneſſe of the harte, doeth no man doute ſaue he that is hertleſſe.Fayth bryngeth loue. And that loue ſpryngeth of faythe thou mayſt euydently ſee. 1. Iohan. 2.

If any man hate hys brother, thou arte ſure that theſame man is in darkenes and hath not the lyght of true faythe nor ſeyth what Chryſte hathe done. If a man ſo loue that he can forgyue his brother, thou arte ſure that he is in the lyght of the true fayth and ſeyth what mercy is ſhewed hym in Chryſt.
               This is then the ſomme of all together workes are the outwarde ryghtuouſnes before the worlde,workes. and may be called the ryghtuouſnes of the mēbers and ſpryng of inwarde loue.Loue.

Fayth chalengeth it for Chryſtes ſake, which hath deſerued al that is promyſed and cleueth euer to the promyſe & truthe of the promyſer, and pretendeth not the goodneſſe of her worke. But knowledgeth that our workes deſerue it not, ſaue are crowned and rewarded wt the deſeruynge of Chryſt. Take an enſāple of yonge chyldren, when the father promyſeth them a good thynge for the doynge of ſome tryfle, and when they come for theyr rewarde,

dalyethe with them ſaynge, what, that thou haſt done is not worth hafe ſo much, ſhulde I geuethe ſo great a thynge for ſo lytle a tryfle? They wyll anſwere, ye dyd promyſe me it, ye ſayde I ſhulde haue it, why dyd ye promyſe, and why then dyd ye ſaye ſo? And let hym ſaye what he wyl to dryue them of, they wyl euer ſay agayne ye dyd promyſe me, ſo ye dyd, ye ſayd I ſhuld haue it, ſo ye dyd. But hyrelinges wyl pretende theyr worke and ſaye, I haue deſerued it, I haue done ſo muche, and ſo muche, and my laboure is worthe it.
               Nowe at the firſt couenaunt makynge with God and as ofte as we be reconſyled, after we haue ſynned,Faythe. the ryghtwyſneſſe cometh of God all together. But after the attonement is made and we reconſyled, then we be partlye ryghtwyſe in our ſelues and vnrightwyſe, ryghtwyſe as ferre as we loue, and vnryghtwyſe as ferre as the loue is vnperfecte. And fayth in the promyſe of God that he dothe reken vs for full ryghtwyſe doth euer ſupply yt vnryghtwyſnes & imperfectnes, as it is our hole ryghtwyſenes at the begynnynge.
               Fynally our workes which God cōmaundeth and vnto which he annexed hys promyſes that he wyll rewarde them / workes are ſacramētes are as it were very ſacramentes and viſyble and ſenſible ſygnes, tokens, yerneſt, oblygacyons, wytneſſes, teſtimonyes, and a ſure certefyenge of our ſoules / that God hath & wyl do accordynge to his promyſe to ſtrengthe our weake faythe and to kepe the

promyſe in mynde. But they iuſtefye vs not, no more thē the viſible workes of the ſacramentes do. As for an enſample, the worke of baptyme that outwarde waſſhynge whiche is the vyſyble ſacrament or ſygne, iuſtefyeth vs not. But God only iuſtefyeth vs actyuely as cauſe effycient or workeman.Baptym. God promyſeth to iuſtefye who ſo euer is baptyſed to beleue in Chriſt, & to kepe the lawe of God that is to ſay, to forgyue them theyr fore ſynnes and to impute ryghtwyſneſſe vnto them, to take them for hys ſonnes and to loue them aſwell as though they were ful ryghtwyſe.Chryſte. Chryſte hathe deſerued vs that promyſe and ryghtwyſneſſe. And faythe do the receaue it. and God dothe gyue it, and impute it to fayth & not the waſſhynge.Faythe. And the waſſhynge dothe teſtefye it / and certyfye vs of it, as the Popes letters do certyfye the beleuers of the Popes perdones. Nowe the letters helpe not or hyndre / but that the perdone were as good without them / as with them / ſaue onelye to ſtablyſhe weake ſoules that coulde not beleue excepte they rede the letters / loked on the ſeale and ſawe the prynte of ſaynt Peters keyes,
               O mercyfull God and a moſte louynge father / howe careth he for vs / fyrſt aboue all and beſyde all hys other benyfytes / to geue vs hys owne ſon Ieſus / and with hym to geue vs hym ſelfe and all, and not content therwith, but to geue vs ſo many ſacramentes or viſible ſygnes to prouoke vs and to helpe our weake faythe and to kepe hys mercye in mynde, as baptyme,

the ſacrament of his body and bloude, and as many other ſacramentes as they wyll haue / yf they put ſygnyfycacions to thē (for we deſtroy none, but they deſtroy whiche haue put out the ſygnificaciōs or fayned ſome without) as wedlocke to ſygnefy that Chriſt is the huſbāde and we his wyfe and partakers wt him, as the wyfe with her huſbande of al his ryches. &c. and beyonde all thoſe vyſible ſacramentes to geue vs yet more ſenſyble and ſurer ſacramentes and ſuraunce of his goodnes, euen in our owne ſelues as yf we loue and gyue almes to our neyghboure, yf we haue cōpaſſyon and pray for hym yf we be mercyful and forgeue him, yf we deny our ſelues, and faſte, and withdrawe all pleſures from the fleſhe for loue of the lyfe to come and to kepe the commaundementes of God. For when ſuche thynges beinge before impoſſible / and nowe are eaſye and naturall / we fele, and are ſure that we be altered and of a newe nature / and a newe creature ſhapen in ryghtwyſnes after the ymage of Chriſt and God our father / ſeynge hys lawes of ryghtwyſneſſe are wrytten in our hartes.
            
            
               
                  When ye faſt, be not ſade as the ypocrites are. For they faſſyon them a newe countenaunce, that it myght appere vnto men, howe they faſte. Verely I ſay vnto you, they haue

theyr rewarde. Thou therfore whē thou faſteſt, annoynte thyne heed & waſhe thy face, that it appere not vnto men howe thou faſteſte. But vnto thy father whiche is in ſecrete And thy father whiche ſeythe in ſecrete, ſhall rewarde the openly.
               
               As aboue of almoſe and prayer, euen ſo here Chryſte rebuketh the falſe entente and ypocryſye of faſtyng. That they ſought prayſe of that worke that was ordeyned for to tame the fleſh and vſed ſuche faſſyons / that all the worlde myght knowe that they faſted / to prayſe them and to ſaye O what holye men are theſe / howe pale and petyfull they loke euen lyke deathe / hangynge downe theyr hedes and beholdynge the erthe, as men clene out of the worlde? If theſe come not to heauen / what ſhall become of vs poore wretches of the worlde? If theſe be not greate in the fauoure of God, and theyr prayers harde what ſoo euer they axe / in what caſe are we laye people? Happy is he that may be a brother amonge them and partaker of theyr prayers and faſtynges and other holye lyuynge, In an vnhappy. In an happy (I wolde ſaye) houre was he borne that buyldethe them a ſell or a cloyſture / or geueth them a porcyon of hys lande to comforte them good men, in thys paynefull lyuynge / and ſtrayte penaunce

which they haue taken vpon them. Bleſſed were he that myght kyſſe the edge of the cote of one of thē. Oh, he that myght haue hys body wrapped in one of theyr olde cotes at the houre of dethe, it were as good to hym as his Chryſtendome. &c. It apereth alſo by yt they axed Chriſte why hys dyſcyples faſted not as well as the pharyſes, yt they oft faſted whē the comen people faſted not & al apere holy. As oures faſt aduent, and begyn before lent at Septuageſima / when. Laus tibi domine cometh in.
               And concernynge the annoyntynge of thy heed. &c. is ment,To annoīt the heed what it meneth. as afore of turnyng the other cheke and of that the lefte hande ſhulde not knowe what the ryght dyd, that is yt they ſhuld auoyde al vayne glory, and faſt to god, and for the entent that God ordeyned it for, and that with a mery hart and cherful countenaūce therby to fele the workyng of God, and to be ſure of his fauoure, Such is the meaninge, and not to bynde thē that wyl faſt to anoynt theyr heed & waſhe theyr faces. And the maner or phraſe of ſpekynge cometh of an vſage, that was among the Iewes, to anoynt thē ſelues with ſwete and odoryferouſe annoyntmentes when they were dyſpoſed to be mery and to make good chere, as ye ſe howe Mary of Bethany poured a boxe of precyouſe oyntmente vpon Chryſtes heed at ſouper.
               As concernynge faſtyng,Faſtynge. it were good that kynges and rulers dyd ſette an order of ſoberneſſe

amonge theyr ſubiects / to auoyde derthe innumerable deſeaſes and the great hepe of vyces that ſprynge of intēperancy / and that they forbade not onelye ryote and exceſſe. But alſo all maner wanton, delycyous and cuſtomable eatynge and drynkynge of ſuch thynges as corrupte the people and make the men more effeminate then the woman, ſo that there remayneth no more tokens of a man in thē ſaue theyr berdes. Our faſſyons of eatinge make vs ſlouth full and vnluſty to laboure and ſtudy / vnſtable inconſtant and lyght manered / full of wyttes, after wytted (as we call it) incyrcumſpecte in conſyderat, hedy, raſhe, and haſtye to begynne vnaduyſedly and without caſtynge of parelles the ende not conſydered what may folowe nor the meanes well loked vpon / howe and by what way the mater might be brought to paſſe tryfelers / mockers / rude / vnſauery / ieſtere with out all maner of ſalte / and euen very apes, and Marmeſettes, and full of wanton and rebaldyſhe communycacyon and lewde geſtures. It corrupteth the wyte with falſe iudgement, and infecteth the body with luſte, and makethe the hole man ſo vnquyet in hī ſelfe, that the bodye can not ſyt ſtyll & reſt in one place and cōtynue in hys worke, nor the mynde perſeuer and endure in our purpoſe.
               Let them prouyde that ther be diligent fyſſhynge in the ſe, and cōmaunde the ſe coſte and townes whyther fyſhe may eaſely come, to faſt fryday, ſaterday and wēſday to, if nede be, and

on the fryday to eate no whyte meate. And let the countryes whiche haue none aboundance of fyſhe, yet haue whyte meate ynough, faſt fryday & ſaterday from fleſhe only. And let thoſe contreys where ſcaſty of bothe is, faſte frydaye from fleſhe only / and eate fleſhe wenſday and ſaterday. But abſteyne from ſuper or from dyner / or eate ſoberly thoſe dayes, And let them ſo moderate theyr faſtes that the people maye beare it / a prouyſyon made for the olde / the ſycke, and feble, &c. whiche faſte ſhalbe a temporall thynge▪ for a temporall comen welthe only, and not a ſeruyce to God.
               Then let the preſtes preache fyrſt the law
                     •
                   truly and teache the people to ſe theyr ſynnes / and ſo brynge them to repentaunce. And ſecondarelye the faythe of Chryſte and the forgyuenes of ſynne thorowe faythe. And thyrdlye almoſe / prayer and faſtynge / which are the hole lyfe of a Chriſten man, and with out which ther is no Chriſten mā a lyue.Almoſe. And let them preache the true vſe of theyr almoſe, whiche is to helpe thy neyghboure with councell, with bodye and goods and al that is in thy power,Prayer. and the true vſe of prayer whiche is to brynge hys neceſſyte & thyne owne before God with a ſtrong fayth in hys promyſes,Faſtynge. and the true vſe of faſtynge which is to tame the fleſhe vnto the ſpirite, that the ſoule may attēde to the worde of God and pray thorowe faythe.
               By theſe thre we kepe the ſpirite of God,Almoſe. Prayer and faſtynge howe neceſſarye. and doth contynue and alſo growe in ryghtwyſnes

and waxe perfecter and perfecter in ſoule and body. And yf theſe fayle or that we vnderſtāde not the ryght entent, we loſe the ſpirite agayne and the ryghtwyſneſſe of faythe / and the true vnderſtandyng of the ſcripture, and al our lernynge ſhalbe but darckenes. And then what a blyndenes is that, when the darcknes of hell is called the lyght of heuen.
               
                  Almoſe. Prayer and faſtynge are inſeperable.As it is of almoſe and prayer, ſo it is of faſtynge, iudge of al thre, where any one of them is, there are they all thre, and where any one is awaye, there is none at all, we muſte haue the profeſſyon of al thre euer wrytten in our hartes I muſt euer loue my neyghboure and be redy to helpe, and when occaſyon is offered, then do it I ought to conſyder and knowe that al cometh of God, and to knowledge that ſame to him in myne hart. And what ſoeuer we nede we ought to know, that we muſt receaue that of God, and therfore to cal euer to him with a ſtrong fayth. Euen ſo I muſt euer fyght agaynſt my fleſhe, & therfore euer withdrawe from it al that moueth it to rebelle agaynſt the ſpirite.
               
                  Faſtynge is not in eatyng and drynkynge onelye.So nowe faſtinge ſtandeth not in eatynge and drynkynge only, and muche leſſe in fleſh alone But in abſtynence of all that mouethe the fleſhe agaynſte the ſpirite, as longe ſleapynge, ydlenes, and fylthye communycacyon and al world lye talkynge, aa of couetouſnes and promocyon and ſuche lyke, and wanton company. ſofte clothes, and ſofte beddes, and ſo forth, which

are that ryght hande, and ryght eye that muſt be cut of and plucked out, that the holeman peryſhe not. And as ye can put no generall rule of almoſe or prayer, no more can ye of faſtyng But I muſt be all waye redye to cut of what ſo euer I perceaue to ſtrenght the fleſhe againſt the ſpirite. And I muſte haue a dylygent eye to the fleſhe and hys complexyon and yf ought ſcape me in worde or dede, ſeke whence the occaſyō came, and attonce cut of that ryght hande and plucke out that eye.
               If this faſt be truly preached,workes make ypocrytes, yf the true entent be awaye. then is faſtynge good / and not afore / for makynge of ypocrytes / as Chriſt wolde not let his diſciples faſt before they were lerned, leſte they ſhulde thereby haue ben no better then the phareſyes. And then the outwarde faſtynge ordeyned by the temporal rulers helpeth much / for the weakes ſake, ye & though the lande were ſo plenteouſe that it nede not to commaunde ſuche faſt for to auoyde derth, ye they ought to ſet ſuche vp, becauſe of them that can not rule them ſelues,Rulers be ordeyned for them that cā not rule them ſelues. for whoſe ſakes they ought to forbyde exceſſes of tauerns and ale houſes and ryotyng out of ſeaſon. For if the people coulde rule them ſelues, what nede rulers. More ouer if any man pryuatlye ſhewe the preſte hys infyrmytyes / and the preſtes ſe any maner of abſtinence or chaſtifyng apte for the perſon, that let him councel him to do for the ſubdewinge of the fleſhe, and not cō
                  maunde as a tyraunt vnder payne of dampnacyon and to make ſatyſfaccyon. Thus wyſe let

hym ſay, brother or ſyſter, ye be bounde vnder payne of deedlye ſynne to tame your fleſhe by ſome maner of waye that ye ſynne not agaynſte God, and I knowe no better then this, my councell and my deſyre therfore is, that ye vſe thys tyll ether ye haue no more nede / or tyll God ſhewe you ſome better. &c. And let the elders conſyder dyligently the courſe of theyr youthe and with wyſdome / councell and dyſcrete gouernaunce / and helpe the yonger to auoyde the perelles and ieoperdyes whiche they haue lerned by theyr owne, experyence to be in yt daungerous iorney.
               
                  Preacher the offyce of a true preacher.More ouer when the people be fallen from their profeſſion and from the lawe, as it ſhalbe impoſſyble for the preacher, to kepe the greate multytude to gether, if the temporal ſwerde be ſlacke and necglygent in punyſhynge open offenſes (as they euer haue and wylbe, ſaue in thoſe poyntes onely wherin lyeth the pythe of theyr owne profyte and aduauntage / and the weyght of theyr honour and mauntenaunce of theyr dygnytyes) and when God alſo (as hys promyſe is) hathe brought vpon them the curſes of the lawe, hungre, derth, batayle, peſtilēce and al maner of plages wt all myſfortune and euell lucke.

and to the apoyntmente and couenaunt of the lorde agayne. As many holy prophetes, preſtes and kynges in the olde teſtamente dyd call the people backe and brought thē agayne in tyme of aduerſyte, vnto the apoyntmēt of the lorde. And the preſte, prophete, or kynge in Goddes ſtede ſmote handes with thē, and toke an oth of thē, to be ye lordes people and to turne agayn to the lordes couenaunte, for to kepe hys lawe and to beleue in his promyſes. And God ymedyatly withdrewe his hande and rydde thē out of all captyuyte and daunger, and be came as mercy full as euer before.
               But we Chriſten haue ben very ſeldome or neuer called agayne to the couenaunte of the lorde ye lawe of god and fayth of Chryſt. But to the couenaūt of the pope often. As he nowe clocketh a paſe of his chekyns and wyll bothe proue al his olde polyces, and ſeke & ymagyn newe, practikes. And if the people come agayn let the preſte or byſhope after the enſample of the prophetes and hye preſtes of the Iſraelytes take an othe in Goddes ſtede of the kynge and lordes. And let the kyng & lordes receuyng an othe of the people, and folowe the enſample of the Neniuites in faſtynge and prayenge.
               Some man wyll ſaye, ſeynge faſtynge is to withdrawe al pleſures frō the body and to punyſhe the fleſhe, then God deliteth in our payn takynge. &c. I anſwere God delyteth in true obedyence and in al that we do at his cōmaundement and for the entent that he cōmaundeth

But and yf thou thynke that God delyteth in the worke or the worke it ſelfe / the true entente awaye / and in thy payne for the payne it ſelfe, thou arte as farre out of the way, as from heuen to the erth, If thou woldeſt kyl thy body or whē it is tame ynoughe, payne him furder that thou were not able to ſerue God and thy neyghboure / accordynge to the roume and eſtate thou arte in / thy ſacrefyce were clene with out ſalte and al to gether vnſauery in the taſt of God, & thou madde and out of thy wyt, but and yf thou truſt in thy worke, then art thou abhomynable.

And here ye haue an infallyble rule that where coutoueſneſſe is / there is no truthe / no thoughe they call them ſelues the churche & ſaye thereto that they can not erre. Couetouſneſſe kepte Iudas ſtyll in vnbelefe thoughe he ſawe and dyd myracles alſo in the name of Chryſte, and compelled hym to ſell hym to the ſcrybes and phareſyes / for couetouſneſſe is a thynge mercyleſſe. Couetouſnes made the phareſyes to lye on Chryſte, to perſecute hym and falſly to accuſe him. And it made Pilate though he founde hym an innocente yet to ſlee hym. It cauſed Herode to perſecute Chryſte yet in hys cradel. Couetouſnes make the ypocrites to perſecute the truth agaynſt their owne conſcyences and to lye to prynces / that the true preachers moue ſedicion and make their ſubiectes to ryſe agaynſte them, and the ſayde couetouſneſſe maketh the prynces to beleue theyr wycked perſwacyons and to lende theyr ſwerde to ſheed

ynnocent bloude.
               Fynally couetouſnes maketh many (whom the truthe pleaſeth at the begynnynge) to caſte it vppe agayne and to be afterwarde the moſte cruel ennemyes thereof after the enſample of Symon Magus. Actes. viii. Ye and after the enſample of Syr Thomas More. K.More. whiche knewe the truthe & for couetouſnes forſoke it agayne and conſpyred fyrſt with the Cardynal to dyſceaue the kynge and to leade hym in darckenes And afterwarde when the lyght was ſpronge vpon them & had dryuen them clene out of the ſcrypture / and had delyuered it out of theyr tyranny, and had expelled the darcke ſtynkynge myſt of theyr deuelyſhe gloſes, and had wyped awaye the cobwebbes whiche thoſe poyſoned ſpyders had ſpeade vpon the face of the clere texte / ſo that the ſpiritualtye (as they call them ſelues) were aſſhamed of their parte, as ſhameleſſe as they be, yet for all that. Couetouſnes blynded the eyes of that glerynge foxe more and more and hardened hys harte agaynſte the trouthe / with the confydence of hys paynted poetry. babyllynge eloquence and iuggelynge argumentes of ſutle ſophyſtry, groūded on his in wrytten verytes, as true and as autentycke as hys ſtorye of Vtopia. Paule therfore byddeth Tymothe to charge the ryche to beleue in the lyuynge God and not in theyr vncerten ryches, for it is impoſſyble for a couetous ydolater or ymage ſeruer that truſteth in the deed God of hys ryches, to put hys truſt in the lyuinge God.

               In lyke maner yf thou be a kynge, do the offyce of a kyng, and receaue the dutyes of the kynge & let God care to kepe the in thy kyngdome.

               And fynally marke one poynt in Lu. 14.Luke. 14. none of them that refuſeth not al that he poſeſſeth can be my dyſcyple, that is / he that caſte the not awaye the loue of all worldly thynges can be no ſcoler of Chriſtes to lerne hys doctryne, Then he addeth that ſalt is good,Couetouſnes maketh the ſalte of Goddes worde vnſauerye. but if the ſalt be vnſauerye or hathe loſt his vertue / what can be ſeaſoned therwith / verely nothynge. Nowe by ſalt is vnderſtāde the doctryne, and the menynge is, yf ye be couetouſe and loue worldlye thynges, it wyll corrupte the ſalte of your doctrine, ſo that what ſo euer you pouder therwith it ſhalbe more vnſauery then before.
               where your treaſure is / there are your hartes, If your treaſure be in the worlde, ſo is the loue of youre hartes. And yf ye loue the worlde and the thinges of the worlde, the loue of God is not in you,Couetouſnes maketh & the loue of God is the loue of hys cōmaundemētes, and he that loueth

Ergo no couetouſe perſon can be a true prophete. It is not for naught thē that Chriſt ſo oft and ſo dylygētly warneth his dyſcyples to beware of couetouſnes, as of that thinge which he wyſt wyl had euer corrupt the word of God and euer ſhulde.

                  Mammon what it is.Māmon is reches or aboundance of goodes. and Chryſte concludeth with a playne ſymylitude, that as it is impoſſyble to ſerue two contrary maſters, & as it is impoſſyble to be retayned vnto two dyuerſe lordes whiche are enymyes one to the other / ſoo is it impoſſyble to ſarue God and Mammon. Two maſters of one minde and one wyl might a mā ſerue, for if one wyll, one mynde and one accorde be in twenty then are they all but one maſter. And two mayſters where one is vnder the other and a ſubſtytute, maye a man ſerue. For the ſeruyce of the inferior is the commaundement of the ſuperior As to ſerue and obey father, mother, huſbande maſter and lorde is Goddes commaundement But and yf the inferyor be of a contrarye wyll to the ſuperyor, and commaunde any contrary thyng, thē mayſt thou not obey.

makynge without fayth.

And the workes be eſtymed of God accordynge to the loue of the harte. If the workes be

great and loue lytle & colde, then the workes be regarded therafter of God. If the workes be ſmall and loue muche and feruent, the workes be taken frr great of God. ❧
