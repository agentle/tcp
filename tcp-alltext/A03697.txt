                  CHRISTIAN Reader: this short Catechism, thus gathered & set downe for the help of the ignorant, cannot be called new, but renewed for their sakes. For, I may say in this case as Salomon in his Ecclesiastes, saydEccles. 1. 9

For, the affections of men stand no lesse diuersly affected towards the variety of Gods gifts, in deliuering one and the same matter, then doth the stomake toward the dressing of one and the same kind of meate in a diuers manner, by some-alteration of forme and manner of doing it.

                  That as it would bee a grieuous thing to a man to liue a banished mans life in som dark prison, couer'd with deadly obscurity, but more gréeuous to liue there among the most spitefull enemies of his father & fathers house: so to be cast into a prison of eternal banishment from God, and pit of vtter darknesse, is a most woful thing; but it is much more wofull, not only to be so, but to be bound in chains of perpetuall fellowship with1. Pet. 5. 8. those, who (from the beginning haue

been enemies to man, and God, the father of mankind, I meane the Diuell, and all his vncleane angels.
               
               
                  
                     Shew this (yet) a little further.
                  
                  If Lots righteous soule was vered2.

And, if we may not lye, to bringRom. 3. 7. glory to God, shall we thinke we may lie to bring profit to man? Therefore the distinction of lies into a malicious, officious, and merry lye, (as if any were lawfull) is not of Gods making.
