               A Declaration exhibited to the King, by his Court of Parlyament.
            
            
               THe members of your Court of Parliament hauing conſulted vpon the Edicte and Bul which your Maieſtie ſent to them, doe beſeeche you to accept in good part ſuch humble declarations as they deſire to geeue you to vnderſtande of before they verifie, or recorde the ſaide Edict or Bull. For notwithſtanding the ſmall acceſſe that our praiers haue aforetime had vnto your Maieſtie doe almoſt ſtop our mouthes, by taking awaie all hope of other aunſwere then heretofore we haue receiued, yet ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe your Maieſtie to continue vs in our offices, wee are boūd to continue in our accuſtomed fidelitie to the diſcharge of your conſcience and ours, which nowe with

your maieſties good liking and fauour, wee doe, taking ſo much the more boldnes in libertie, as the enemies of your eſtate, doe weene to haue licence to abuſe your godlines and deuotion for the couering of their impietie and rebellion.
            If it had pleaſed God that thoſe reaſons which were debated in your preſence concerning the publiſhing of the Edict of Iulie laſt paſt, might haue pearced the eares of that patience & good affection which your maieſtie was accuſtomed to reſerue to the voice of this companie, wee ſhould not now be driuen to this extremitie: for euen then Sir, you might haue perceiued that thoſe perſons who vnder a verie vncertaine hope of reuniting your ſubiectes to one onelie religion, did paune foorth your authority and conſcience to the moſt aſſured deſtruction of your Eſtate: That they had not leagued and vnited themſelues to anie other ende but to diſunite your ſubiectes from your obedience, wherein through an

eſpetiall and ſingular grace of God they remained vnited, notwithſtanding their diſunion in Religiō. That although their armies are great and terrible, as appeareth by the great miſchiefes and oppreſſions that your people doe beare at their hands, yet wee maie by the experience of that which is paſt, iudge them to be ouerweake to put their purpoſes in execution: That notwithſtanding they had meanes to doe it, yet your maieſtie ought not to imploie them, becauſe the offence which you ſeeke to correct is tied to the conſciences, which are exempt from all power of iron or fire, & may be intreated with other meanes more conuenient to that fatherlie affection which your people haue euermore found in you, conſidering that euen thoſe men whom ſo often you haue ſought by force to compell, doe now voluntarilie offer to ſubmitte themſelues to all reaſon, and vnto that courſe they haue euermore beene allowed in the church.
            
               But in as much as that that is decreede cannot be reuoked, alſo that the edict which is now vpon the file, is but the execution and concluſion of the former, wee doe not deſire to declare vnto you anie other thing, but that it maie pleaſe your Maieſtie to call to minde that kings are ſhepheards, and the Edic
                  •
               es their ſhepheard
                  •
                ſtaues, wherewith they guide their flocke vnder a milde and gratious gouernment, 
                  •
               hich is more profitable to the flock then to the ſhepheard: For your maieſ
                  ••
               e may of your ſelfe conceiue that the name of an Edict can no waie be accōmodated vnto this bloody preſcription which in ſo expreſſe termes conteineth the generall cauſe of the flocke, and ſo conſequentlie the diſanulling of the office and authoritie of the ſhepheard.
            Admitte the whole number of Proteſtants were reduced into one onelie perſon, yet is there not that man among vs that dare conclude vpon death againſt the ſame, before

the formal determination of his proceſſe, Wherby if he were not duelie attaint and conuict of ſome capitall or heinous crime, ſuch as might condemne the offender, we ſhoulde bee lothe to deſtroie a good Citizen. Who therefore is he that without anie order of lawe dare diſpeople ſo manie Townes, and deſtroie ſuche a number of Prouinces, and ſo conuert this Realme into aſhes▪ Who I ſaie is he that dare pronounce the worde that ſhal expoſe ſo manie millions of men, women and children to death? Yea and that without anie cauſe or apparant reaſon, conſidering they be not taxed with anie other crime thē hereſie: an hereſie (if it maie be termed hereſie) as yet vnknowen, or at the leaſt vndecided: an hereſie which they haue defended euen in your owne preſence againſt the moſt famous Diuines in your Realme: an hereſie wherin they haue bin borne, and for the ſpace of theſe 30 yeeres brought vp, by the ſufferance of your maieſtie, and the late king your brother

of happie memorie. Euen an hereſie which they remit to the iudgement of an vniuerſall, generall, or Nationall Councel.
            The breach of the Edict of pacification hath brought vs forth ſo manie calamities, as there is no tongue able ſufficientlie to expreſſe them: & it were a harde matter to note one ſole benefite receiued in exchaunge of the ſame, except that it hath a far larger ſcope then was thought for. For thoſe that make ſo cheape markets of the Proteſtants skins, would neuer haue brought you to their opinion, if they could haue imagined the number to haue beene ſo great as at this daie, now that they are forced to aſſemble themſelues together, it appeareth. And who is hee that with himſelfe can conſpire the murdering of ſuch a multitude without horror, or that maie conſent therto vnleſſe he abandon all feeling of humanitie?
            Conſider ſir what affection thoſe men can beare to your ſeruice, when

they thirſt ſo much after your bloud, what fidelitie they bring to the preſeruation of this ſo fraile and auncient eſtate, when they ſoake out that our remainder of force and ſtrength by ſo vnreaſonable bloodletting, that euen thoſe that ſhalbe the Barbers and Surgeons, ſhalbe in danger of drowning themſelues. For we alas, haue at ouer high a price learned that thirtie or fourtie thouſand Proteſtants, armed for the defence of their liues, & of whatſoeuer els they hold dere in this world, cannot be ouerthrowen without the loſſe of verie neere as manie Catholickes, who marching againſt their willes to this warfare, can hardlie counteruaile the forces of thoſe whoſe hope reſteth in deſpaire and who haue nothing left but courage and weapons.
            If the Lords vengeance doeth ſo fiercelie purſue vs, who ſhal remaine to obeie this Edict? If both parties once come to fleſh themſelues each vpon other, euen to the vtter deſtruction and ruine of the one or other

partie, who dare promiſe himſelfe that he ſhal remaine and enioie the victorie, if it may be termed a victorie after ſuch deſtruction? or rather, what ſhall remaine for the plague & famine which alredie doe pleade againſt warre, for the honor of the vtter ruine of your Realme?
            But what maie the poſteritie ſaie, when it ſhal heare that your court of Parliament hath propounded the honoring of the articles of a league, aſſembled againſt the eſtate: armed againſt the kinges perſon: riſen vp againſt God himſelfe: Yea ſuch a one as ſpiting nature, commaundeth the fathers to bee no longer fathers to their ſonnes: the mothers to be no mothers to their daughters: inuiting one frend to betraie another, & calling the murderer to the ſucceſſion of the murdered, with the fatherlie name of your edictes?
            We will no longer ſtand vpon the particularities of the iniquities, and wronges, in an infinite number gathered together vnder this forme of

Edict, wherby thoſe that are authors thereof doe hope to be able to winne the Realme, when they haue once put you to loſe it. But wee beſeech your maieſtie not to bee led by their counſailes, which proceede onelie from blinde ambition: but rather as you haue begun, ſo to folowe the ſo renowmed exāple of the wiſdome & iuſtice of Salomon, for as he, to the end to trie out the true mother from the ſuppoſed, fained to become cruell, ſo do we likewiſe hope that your maieſtie hauing made ſhew to communicate in the tirannous deſires of the league, to the ende to diſcouer them, will take heede of fulfilling them, and rather make your profite of the ſame to the preſeruation of your naturall and obedient ſubiects.
            Wee meane not herein, for to excuſe the taking of Montlymar, and many other places ſurpriſed by thoſe of the pretended Religion, neither doe we deſire anie thing ſo much, as that a good peace might reſtore ſtrength & authoritie to your lawes,

whereby to doe you right: but Nature permitting all men to defende their liues by whatſoeuer meanes, doeth ſomewhat excuſe thoſe that haue beene brought to that neceſſitie, and contrariwiſe the ſinne of the others is inexcuſable, in that, that they counſaile your Maieſtie to ſo pernicious a warfare, onelie vpon licouriſhnes of the confiſcation of the Proteſtants goods, whom with ſuch rigors they haue forced to ſeeke recompence of their loſſes at your coſte, and to confiſcate whatſoeuer they maie be able to enterpriſe vpon your maieſtie.
            As for the Bul, the curat findeth the ſtile thereof to be new, vnuſuall, and ſo farre from the modeſtie of former Popes, that it doeth no waie therein acknowledge the order of a Succeſſor to the Apoſtles. And becauſe throughout our recordes, or in anye antiquitie we find not that the princes of Fraunce haue beene ſubiect to the Popes iuſtice, either that ſubiects haue taken notice of their Princes religion,

the Court cannot determine thereupon vntill the Pope can proue his right which he pretendeth in the tranſlation of Realmes eſtabliſhed and ordeined by GOD, before the name of Pope came into the world: Vntil hee hath declared vnto vs by what title he entermedleth in the ſucceſsion of a youthfull and ſtrong prince, who by the courſe of nature maie haue his heire in his loines: Before he hath inſtructed our Religion, with what apparance of iuſtice or equitie he denieth the lawe of nations▪ to ſuch as are fallen into hereſie, yea againſt the holie canons and auncient decrees, which neuer ſuffer anie to be holden for an heretike, vntil he hath beene freelie heard in his reaſons, admoniſhed by ſundrie ſynodes & iudged by a Councell called and freelie gathered together: Hee muſt teach vs with what kinde of pietie & holines he geueth that which is not his owne, or taketh awaie that that lawfullie belongeth to another: That he ſtirreth vp the vaſſals & ſubiectes

to mutinies againſt their lords and ſoueraigne Princes, and ouerthroweth the foundations of al lawes and polliticke order: To be breefe, he muſt ſhewe vs by what authoritie hee enterpriſeth to condemne your blood to the fire, & as it were, to ſend part of your ſoule into hell.
            But in as much as this newe Pope in lieu of inſtruction, doeth in his bul breathe out nothing but deſtruction and changeth his ſhepheardes ſtaffe into a flaming or fierie torche, wherwith vtterlie to deſtroie thoſe whom if they be ſtraied, he ought to winne again to the flock of the church. The Court can no longer conſult vpō the publication of a Bull ſo pernitious vnto all Chriſtendome, & to the ſoueraintie of your crowne, euen preſentlie deeming it worthie no other recompence, then the ſame which one of your Predeceſſors cauſed vs to geue to the like Bul ſent vnto him by one of this Popes predeceſſors: and that was to caſt it into the fire in the preſence of the whole Frenche

Church, inioining his Atturney generall to make diligent inquiſition after thoſe that had proſequuted the expedition thereof in the Court of Rome, to the ende to miniſter ſo ſeuere & ſpeedie iuſtice againſt them, that it might ſerue for an example to all poſterities.
            For who knoweth not that all thoſe ſuttleties are ſued out by al the enemies of this eſtate, who vnder the name of your heires doe directlie addreſſe themſelues againſt your owne perſon, imagining that alredie by their practiſes they haue atteined the type of their attempts, and that they haue no more to do but by the cloke to plucke you out of your ſeate, to the end to take ful poſſeſsion of that which they haue barked at, and followed ſo long.
            Theſe things are ſo euident, and haue been ſo narowlie ſearched out, that it were in vaine for vs to abuſe your patience with anie larger declarations, whereof we doe not hope anie greater effect or vertue then of

the former. But if it be ſo that our ſinnes haue vtterlie cloſed vp the eares of your clemencie againſt iuſtice, yet doe vs this fauour, to take into your handes againe thoſe officer wherewith it hath pleaſed your maieſtie and the kinges your predeceſſors to honor vs withal, ſo ſhall you be freed from the importunate difficulties which we are forced to make at ſuch Edictes, and our conſciences diſcharged from the curſe that God hath prepared for wicked magiſtrates and their Counſailors.
            The neceſſitie of your affaires haue manie times heretofore forced vs to winke at ſundrie oppreſsions & pernitious inuentions.
            The opinion which your maieſtie had conceiued that thoſe of the pretended reformed Religion woulde habandon the exerciſe thereof, and that that faction might be oppreſſed without much bloodſhed or deſtructiō of this eſtate, haue yet receiued ſo much power ouer our aduiſes as to cauſe vs to paſſe the reuocation of

verie manie Edictes, ſo ſolemnlie ſworne vnto.
            We doe now to our great grief and confuſion perceiue how ſmall profite to you our cowardlines hath brought, how hurtfull it hath beene to all your ſubiectes: and how ſhameful to vs and our poſteritie. Our patience can no lenger be obedience, but vnexcuſable aſtoniſhment if it ſtretcheth anie further, or proceedeth to careleſneſſe and contempt of all Common welth.
            It is therefore more conuenient for your maieſtie to haue no Courte of Parliament, then to ſee the ſame vnprofitable as we are, & it wil be more honorable for vs to returne priuate into our houſes, or in our boſomes to bewaile the publicke calamities with the reſt of our fellow Citizens, then to enthrall the dignitie of our offices to the curſed inuentions of the enemies of your Crowne.
         
         
            
            An aduertiſement to the three Eſtates of Fraunce, concerning the warre of the League.
            
            
               MY Maiſters you were heretofore ſufficientlie aduertiſed yt the league, notwithſtāding whatſoeuer it promiſed, would breede great calamities in this Realme, and yet do ſmal harm to the king of Nauarre, and his partakers. Likewiſe that it was made properlie againſt this Realme, and ſo acknowledged at the firſt by both the king & all your ſelues. The K. of N. as he in him ſelfe feeleth the leaſt harme and you the principall, ſo is he but the 
                  •
               ullor and pretence.
            The worſt is that you had more minde to ſee it then to preuent it, & to feele it, euen to the quick, then to beleeue it. Notwithſtanding in deede I know that manie of you haue ſerued for Caſſandra
                     •
                  s vnto Troy, as hauing ſmall authoritie to turne away y• miſchiefe, though wiſe inough & ſufficientlie

aduiſed to foretel it.
            The authors of this League to the ende the more eaſilie to induce you to enter into this warre, did propoūd great facilitie therein. It woulde be done in three daies, the beſt houldes were not to hould out the firſt ſounde of their name. The K. of Na. was by & by ſtumbled: there wanted no more but the making of his Epitaph: If anie man preſumed but once to make mē
               tion of 25. yeres euil ſpent in this like purpoſe, that is to ſay, much time waſted in conſuming our ſelues, it was an offence and prooued hereſie, neither wanted there theſe ordinarie replications, namelie that the League that now was taken in hand was a farre other matter, and that theſe Capteines knewe other ſleights, and thus vio
               
                  •
               ence in lieu of reaſon made them to preuaile.
            Marke here my maiſters the progreſſe of their affaires in one yeere, meaſure by that yeeres worke all the 
                  •
               eſt, notwithſtanding their principall 
                  •
               eate be vaniſhed in ſmoke, and the

moſt part of their choler conuerted into flegme, and thereby you maie bee able to iudge of the ſucceſſe of that which is to come: for you ſhall ſee that as wearied and tired as alreadie we be, wee haue not ſet forward anie one good ſtep, but that we haue gone backe two for it.
            After the edict of Iulie which proceeded by the violence of the league, the Lorde of Mayne tooke vpon him the prouince of Guyenne, and to that ende had beſide the forces of the league, al the kings power committed to him, whereby eche one may iudge what armie that was: (for of two reaſonable ſtrong armies hee made but one) hee departed poſſeſſed with a great maſſe of monie, and had in a maner dried vp the whole deuotion of the Clergie: he wanted neither artillerie nor munition. But beſides if you will but call to minde either their brags, or your owne imaginations a
                  •
                that time, you ſhall finde that all the walles in Guyenne mouldered away and vaniſhed in duſt: yea euen the

               King of Na. wiſt not where to become to ſhroud himſelfe.
            And in deed it is moſt certaine that he was then vnarmed as one that neither woulde, neither could be perſuaded that the obedience which he ſtill yeelded to the king, coulde haue turned to his deſtruction: hee was armed with ſure cōfidence in God the mainteiner of the right, yea, euen naked againſt armed iniurie, hee thought him ſelfe ſufficiently couered vnder his kings armour, which ſhould haue defended him, ſith he had ſo far honored him, as to acknowledge and take his quarell for his owne.
            Well the ſaid L. of Mayne cōmeth into Poictou and Xantoigne: he leaueth behind him Rochel, and S Iohn d'Angely, Pons, &c, And ſetting vpon nothing (yet were theſe places neereſt the hart of the realme, & occaſion fell verie well out, for at that time they were ſo vexed with ye plague, that the ſouldiers could ſcarce a bide to continue among them) he thence tooke his way through Perigord, where by compoſition,

he tooke the Caſtle of Montignac le Conte, a place that had bene as it were the banner of all the former troubles as euerie one knoweth, and the courſe of his voiage did beare as if hee ſhoulde haue gone to Bergerac, there to haue tried the firſt furie of his armie, but he tooke his way by Souillac, where hee paſſed ouer Dordonne leauing Monfort, Turenne, Saint Cere, places belonging to the Vicount of Turenne vntoucht. Thence he entred into Queacy, where the aduerſarie held Figeac, Cadenac, Ca
                     •
                  earc, and other places, hee was lodged in the middeſt of them three whole weekes, hee was deſired by the eſtates of the countrie, vrged by the Biſhop of Cuhorls, & importunatly called vpon by the Seneſchall, to deliuer them: yea it is not vnknowen to what words the Lordes of St. Supplice and Camburat grewe vnto with him, vvhen they ſee all the countrie vvaſted and brought into famine, & all vvithout profit, and in deed he did nothing but compoūd vvith tvvo or three gentlemen of the

weakeſt lodged, with condition that they might exerciſe their religion in their houſes, ſo that they proſecuted no warre from their holds, ſauing that in their owne perſons they might do it in anie other place.
            His excuſes were that he would goe clenſe the riuers and aſſure the traficke of the countrie. Alſo the moſt truſtie he tolde in their eares, that he would ſurprize & aſſaile the K. of Na. whereſoeuer hee were. A truantlike ſtratageme if euer there were anie, which neuertheles was their foundation, as if Fraunce had beene a cheſſe board, wherin a prince could not haue walked aboue foure ſteps, & in deede the K. of Nau. hauing as well as hee could furniſhed ſuch places as hee left behinde him, paſſed ouer the riuer of Garonne betweene the two armies of the ſaid Duke of Mayne, and the marſhall of Matignon which laie not paſt foure or fiue leagues from him, and ſo came to Bergerac euen in the face of the Duke of Maynes armie and there aboade a whole moneth togither

without either riuer or brooke betvveene them, and yet had neuer ſo much as one all arume giuen him, and ſo finallie went into Xantogne ſetting forward toward Fraunce, and viſiting his gouernment euen to the bankes of Loyre. This did he whō they ſhould haue chaſed awaie within foure moneths, yea hee whome they ſhoulde haue brought to the baie, vnleſſe hee had reſolued ſpeedely to auoide the realme.
            The marſhall of Matignon had beſieged Caſtetz, a houſe of the L. Faba
                     •
                  
                ſtanding vpon Garonne, when the L. of Mayne came. The ſaid Lord of Mayne vvithout his knovvledge, to the ende to rob him of that ſmall glorie, compounded for xii. thouſande crovvnes to haue it yeelded to him, vvhich was an vnuſuall matter among ſouldiers, that a place being beatē & the breach made ſhould be aſſaulted with ſiluer.
            Since that time he tooke S. Bazeill, Montſegur and Caſtillon, places vnknovvne before theſe vvarres: places neuer mentioned in the moſt particuler

maps: places of no name but onlie for the reſolution of defence, and yet ſuch places, eſpeciallie Montſegur and Caſtillon, as haue coſt him deere euerie vvaie. And it is moſt certaine that had not the peſtilence vexed Caſtillon more then a man would vveene, hee had bene hardlie ſet before it, conſidering that the Lord of Turenne did ſuccour & refreſh it euen in the ſight of the ſaid D. of Mayne. This is the ſumme of al that he hath done in Guyenne in one vvhole yere: Where you are alſo to note that the K. of N. hath increaſed himſelfe with Tayllebourge and Royan, places that be ſtrong both by arte and nature, hauens, yea the mouthes of Charent and Garonne, I ſpeake not of St. Iohn d'Angely Tonnay-Charent & others, vvhich beſides them are recompence ſufficient for Castetz and St. Bazeile.
            
            I leaue to ſaie that Garonne vvhich vvas promiſed to be opened for the contenting of Tholouze and Burdeaux doe ſtil remaine ſhut, yea more ſtraitlie then before the vvar: for you muſt

not thinke that after the taking of St. Bazeile the ſaid Lorde of Mayne durſt ſet vpon Caumont vvhich hauing the riuer betvvene thē ſtoode in his face, neither Mas and the other places that commande ouer Gàronne, beſides that at the ſame time they fortifi
                  •
               d the towne of Meillan, vvhich is more worth then all that he hath taken, as the countrie men knowe well inough, beſides alſo certeine ſorts on each ſide of the water, vvhich ſince they haue builte beneath Clairac, vvhereby the marchants to whom he had giuen his word to make free the trafick before the laſt Chriſtmas, forbidding them expreſſelie vpon paine of death to compounde for the libertie and aſſurance of the paſſage for them, and their wares doe finde themſelues further to ſeeke then at the firſt, while in the meane time for want of traffike they haue incurred ſundrie loſſes wherebie diuerſe are become Bankerupts, haue finally growen to compoſition, curſing the League and all the fauourers thereof. But that was it

which marſhall Matygnon verie well perceiued, which alſo howe modeſt ſoeuer otherwiſe, hee coulde not in ſome of his letters conceale, namelie, that the Duke of Mayne had enterprized more vpon Tholouxe and Burdeux, meaning by Caſtle Trompet, then vpon Mas of Verdun or Caumont.
            
            Nowe iudge you what likelihoode there is that herafter they maie make anie great account of the reſt of Guyenne: For all ſuch places as at the entry into the warre, that began about the latter ende of the yeere, might haue wanted victuals, haue nowe at eaſe made their prouiſion, euen with their neighbors conſents, whether it were, that common neceſſitie of both parts vrged them to ſuch mutuall offices, either els that they abhorre ſuch extremities and deteſt the miſerie of the time: & yet in their notes vvhich they exhibited to the King vvherebie to perſvvade him of the eaſineſſe of this affaire, the ſame vvas ſet dovvne as an eſpecial mene that they pretended againſt the principall townes, a meane

truelie that holdeth more of the nature of extremitie then of a meane, & vvhich is more, ſuch a meane as they cannot come to againe in tvvo good yeres and more.
            Neither haue the affaires of the League proſpered anie better in other Prouinces. For the L. of Mountmorancye, who in reſpect of the iniurie that he perceiued to be done to the K. of Nauar, hath aſſociated himſelfe vnto him▪ hath brought to his deuotion Lodeue and Pons tvvo Biſhoppes▪ Seas, with their Dioceſes. He hath fortified both the bankes of Rhoſne, Hee hath ſhotte out his rootes ſo farre into Prouence that they haue beene forced to graunt to the Gentlemen free exerciſe of Religion. All that maie be ſaide to be vvonn in Languedock is the forte of Monteſquyon, latelie won rather by treſon then ſtrength, vvhich may be coū
               terpeized vvith a number of Fortes of like mettle taken in Prouence, and Marueyolz, which hereafter vvill ſerue onelie to make all other reſolute, in reſpect that contrary to the promiſed

faith there were ſuch cruelties & exceſſes committed therin that hereafter wee muſt ſeeke to finde out newe names wherwith to deſcribe thē. But the ſiege of Mas St. Puels alone is enough to counterpeiſe all the glorie thereof, as beeing the moſt miſerable and weakeſt place of all L'A

            I leaue ſundrie caſtles in diuers prouinces taken with leſſe then ten poūd of pouder, for the which the league would haue rung al their belles, & enriched al the mercers of the Pallace, if it had won them with the canon: neither doe I ſaie that theſe ſmall holdes which ye Lord of Mayne ſoundeth in our cares, doe euerie of them coſte a million of golde, beſides the liues of the beſt of our ſouldiers, whereas the good townes afore mentioned, coſte not the K. of Na. and his aſſociates paſt ſome Petronel ſhot, & ſcarce one man.

To be ſhort, all things conſidered, vvil anie man be ſo fond as to exchange Royan & Taillebourg in Guyen, Lodeue and St. Ponsun Languedock, Mountlimart, Ambrin and Dye in Daulphine &c. for Montgnac, Caſtetz, St. Bazeil, Mountſegur and Caſtillon, the tokens of the victories of the League, the Trophyes of the Duke of Mayne, but coſtlie and ruinous triumphes, yea I dare wel ſaie funerall triumphes
            Now that they haue ſpit all their fire commeth in a mightie Forreine armie to the ſuccour of the K. of Na. what miracle will the League here bring forth to couer vs? When beefore the King it was alleadged that vndoubtedlie hee ſhoulde haue ayde from the Princes that profeſſed the ſame Religion with him, though they ſhott expreſlie at Religion, and that they would needes haue the viſard

pulde of, they had, if wee woulde beleeue them, long beefore ſeene to that: Concerning the Queene of Englànde they ſhould cutte her out ſo much worke from the Scottiſh partes euen in her owne Realme, that ſhee ſhould haue inough to doe, and it is no doubt but they haue kindeled all fire brands, ſtirred vp all aſhes, and blowen at euerie ſparke that they might, and yet it hath pleaſed God to breathe ſuch a blaſt vpon their purpoſes that Englande was neuer ſo quiet, neuer ſo ſtronglie vnited to Scotland▪ neither had euer more euident viewe of Gods bleſſings either at home or abroade, for that God manie times and freelie hath miraculouſlie diſcouered thoſe practiſes that the Ieſuites ſtirred vp againſt the ſaid Q. of England her perſon and eſtate, and contra wiſe fauoured her enterpriſes that ſhe hath taken in hande for the defence of thoſe whom ſhe knew to be wrōgfullie oppreſſed.
            To the ende to take away al difficulties, they did in a maner enter into

bond to the King, that the K. of Na. ſhoulde haue no ſuccour out of Germanie. To colour this vaine hope, they alleage thoſe old controuerſies vpon ſome points of religion betweene the French & the Dutch churches, which they promiſed by their practiſes to nouriſh. And now to the contrarie, we ſee that ſuch polices haue ſerued onlie to reunite their hearts, and ceaſſe their diſputations: that they are moſt firmelie reconciled together to the ende hencefoorth to make it all one bodie and one cauſe: that the King of Denmarke, the Princes & Electors of the Empire, the L. of the Cantous of the Swytſers, and the Griſons do finde them ſelues greeued in the perſon of this prince, feeling themſelues hurt in his woundes, and teinted in his iniuries. As in deed, who would not haue bene moued: who would not perceiue the conſequence of that which was framed againſt him?

They ſhoulde haue armed the Germans, one againſt another: they ſhould haue renued the olde braules betweene the Catholicke and Proteſtant Princes, neither, ſaid they, did they want deuices to deuide the Proteſtantes among themſelues. Where be now theſe great pollicies? what is become of all theſe diſcourſes, ſith that Germany was neuer at better vnion in it ſelfe, or more diſpoſed to ſuccour their enemies: or now what wil they doe to that wretch Caſimire (for ſo doe they terme this Prince) who one of theſe dai

The ſtate of it trotted all ouer the Pallace, it was redde ouer the Court of the Loure, But where I praie you doeth it now ſleepe? why doeth it not appeare at this neede? nay who knoweth not that to the contrarie the Lords of Venice the moſt anciēt frends and confederats of this Realme haue offred the king ſuccour againſt the League, and doe nowe exhort him to peace. That the king of Spayne vpon whom they build all their purpoſes, ſith they haue not perfourmed vvhat they promiſed, hath left them in the mid vvay and vvith reproch returned their agentes. And vvhat vvill they ſaie to Pope Sixtus himſelfe, vvho hath confeſſed to the Lord of Mountmorencie that they had ouerreached him in their declaration publiſhed againſt the King of Nau▪
                and the Prince of Conde, hee praieth him to pacific matters, euen he vnder whoſe ſhadow they ſought to prouoke them: The Pope who euen in Auignon, and that by expreſſe treatie, permitteth to the contrarie partie of Daulphine & Prouence
               
free acceſſe, to the end vvith his leaue dailie to dravv thence victuals, weapons, pouder, and all other munition of warre.

            But they wil fight with them, and in deede that is one of the greefes publiſhed in their pamphlets, vz. that in the former troubles the ſtraungers were not fought with vpon the frontiers: Faine would I learne who letted them when in the firſt troubles the late D. of Guyſe commanded ouer the power of Fraunce?

But this is their wonted maner. To the end to haue weapon in hand and to become arbitrators of the affaires, they wil for a time be holden for Proteſtants.

            To be briefe, wil you ſee the good that the League hath done generallie in all Fraunce. It hath kindeled the fire both in all the foure corners there of and in the midſt alſo. It hath filled all the beſt Prouinces and the beſt

townes with famine, and hath not yet ſet one ſtep forward in all the pretended enterprize. It promiſed to roote out all the Proteſtants, and ſee they haue now taken more anchore holde. It ſhould driue them into Germanie, and behold it hath brought Germanie into Fraunce. It promiſed to root out their doctrine, and now marke how it hath brought vs to ſtriue with them who ſhal haue the ſtaffe, and to make new lottes, and as it were to reenter into a nevv diuiſion with them, where before they were content with ſuch ſhare and condition, as wee liſted to graunt them.
            Let vs▪ therefore looke whether the League that hath confounded all this Eſtate, hath at the leaſt done anie particular good to our eſtates. They were ſhrouded, as you all knovv, vnder the thr

they were not Succeſſors to the beautiful ſurname that he deſerued, namelie, Father of the people. Hereupon you had warning inough that you ſhould bee more ouercharged then before. That a newe warre woulde bring in nevve impoſtes. That the League to the end to binde you, gaue you an earneſt penie, but vndoutedlie onelie to binde you to the bargaine, and to make you to pay the contract. Marke now therefore at one yeres ende the ſuttletie of the league Conſider what this Commonwealth hath in gendred: Seuen and twentie new Edicts at one clap, which ſeuen and twentie yeeres could not haue brought forth: Burdē
               ſome edictes edictes to the whole world. The dregs and ſcum of all the inuention of the Italian Courtiers. What wanted there more to oppres the poore people? to fulfil ye confuſion of this realm? In the Eſtates holden complaint vvas made that multitude of officers in matters of Lavve vvas no other but multitude and delaie of cauſes, & now behold an increaſe of preſidents, coū

Courtes & preſidiall ſeas: marke the alternatiue receiuers for the ſpices, in paying rent for the multiplying, mainteining, delaying and enhaunſing of proceſſes. Infinite times had the ſuppreſſion, or ordering of the vnbrideled number of Atturneies bene propounded, and now we ſee them not onelie innumerable, but alſo ſucceſſiue or hereditarie. Novv I ſaie we maie ſee our cauſes that holde margent and line▪ and paſsing from hand to hand, from father to ſonne in the atturneies, grovve to be perpetuall to our poſteritie. Howe much better had it bene to haue let the king alone quiet, vvho at the beginning of this League tended onlie to the reeſtabliſhing of the miniſtration of Iuſtice throughout his Realme? who ſo carefullie conſulted with the principall of his ſoueraigne Courts what meanes were moſt conuenient to reſtore all things into order▪ Long inough had vve perceiued that number of officers in the de

ſo as the crovvne paſsing from the poore man, going through ſo manie treaſurers hands, vvas ſcarce worth a teſterne to the kinges purſe, which bred the counſel to reſtore the auncient manner, vvhich was that all the kinges coine ſhould immediatelie be tranſported into the kings treaſurie, ſo ſhould they ſpare both the auditor and the accomptes: So might they ſaue two third parts of the treaſurie, and by this ſauing the K. might without hurting him ſelfe haue caſed his people of one third and more. But vvhat ſhall we doe now, now I ſaie that they giue vs newe generalles and generallities▪ that they ſet vp againe without anie reaſon the elections which vpon ſo good reaſons had bin ſuppreſſed? that they make the offices of the chambers of accompts hereditarie and al other offices ſaleable? which is as much to ſaie as to make the treaſurie of the Realme patrimoniall, hereditarie, and ſaleable both to the dealers themſelues & to thoſe that ſhould iudge of the dealing therein?

Theſe be the goodlie ſucceſsions that the controuerſie of ſucceſsion, ſo out of ſeaſon propounded, haue taught vs. Succeſsions of pleaders and triflers: Succeſsions of theeues & robbers of the Commonvvealth, Succeſſiōs of deuourers, a thouſand ſucceſſors, euē during the kings life, to this Realme ſeeing they ſucceede in his treaſure.
            The king before theſe commotions propoūded the releeuing of his poore people, but novv vve ſee them reduced into the extremitie of confuſion: he purpoſed to redeeme his demaines, now he ſelleth them outright: to diminiſh courts and ſubſidies, hee nowe doubleth them, yea hee ſelleth them, which he neuer did before: he went about to aboliſh olde tributes, nowe from time to time he raiſeth new, and thoſe of ſo manie ſorts that wee ſhall neede a Calepine to learne to knowe their names. All theſe newe charges and oppreſſions, al theſe inuentions, are the ſubtiltie of the League which would not giue the king leiſure to benefite his people, as enuying ye wealth,

peace, and reſtoring of this Realme: enuying the honour that ſhoulde redound to the king for reeſtabliſhing it: and enuying the good affection & loue that hee ſhoulde winne with his people, by graunting them ſome releaſe after ſo manie labours. Neither thinke but the Capteins of this league doe reape the cheefe commoditie, for beſides that one part of theſe newe Edicts is dedicated to the maintenance of the warre that they haue bred, and is guided by their hands, and ſo conſequentlie goeth through their fingers, it is not vnknowen that the Duke of Guyſe hath gotten to himſelf particularlie the edict of tenne ſellers of Sea fiſh, and the edict of twelue ſellers of cattel at Paris, the edict that maketh vs the alternatiue receiuers for the ſpices, and the edict of amplification to all the ſeas royall to taxe throughout ye realm.

Hee that hath largeſt walkes of lande, is moſt charged with the entries of his wines, corne, and fleſh, with the dobling of ſubſidies, with the impoſt of hoſtries:

let vs goe farther, hee that hath moſt lande hath vſually moſt matters in law, and therefore to ſpeake vprightlie, it is we that are charged with new preſidēts, councelers, lieutenants, offices &c. It is we that paie the alternatife receiuers for the ſpices, and are to wage the hereditie of the begging atturneies. The launce is firſt ſtroken into ye ſkinne of the peſant, of the marchāt, of ye officer, & of the atturnie, &c The firſt blood, the firſt ſiluer cōmeth from them and out of their purſe: but they fill them ſelues againe out of the higher partes: they licke them ſelues hole at our coſt. For the peaſant hath skill inough to enhaunce his labour and fruites: the marchant to caſt his accountes & to rayſe the price of his marchandize, the officer by perticulers to bring in the graunde ſum that he hath disburſed, the atturnie to enlarge his lignes and ſet a greater rate of his writing and ſteps. Finallie all of them doe recouer what they haue paide aforehand, and of whome, forſooth of the gentleman who ſticketh

to his loſſes, and haue no further or higher degree where to recouer himſelfe.
            Concerning our honours, you remember that in their proteſtatiō they ſhoulde reſtore each thing into his eminencie, lodge euerie one according to his degree, cauſe the gouernmentes to be reſtored to thoſe from whom they pretende them to bee taken, &c. And becauſe ſome men were vexed euen at the heartes to ſee certeine gentlemen about the K. which through his fauour and good will had at once atteyned to the greateſt honours, this argument did they vſe to poyſon vs with all: but you maie call to mynde that when the peace was concluded, there was no one word ſpoken thereof, neither ſeemed they to reſtore anie one of thoſe for whoſe ſakes they ſeemed to take offence. And as for thoſe whome in their vvritinges they ſo mangled, they haue ſince moſt vildlye ſought their fauours and endeuoured by all meanes to binde them to them,

and in deede you and they ſee them both greater and in further auctoritie then euer before. I here meddle not with the kinges choice, I touch not their deſerts, I knowe there is no dignitie ſo great, but is opened to the nobilitie, or to which the arme of vertue can not reach: but onelie I would haue you marke what pretēces they make and howe they doe dallie with vs at pleaſure, alſo that we may know that they vſe our diſpleaſures, our miſlikes and our greefes: and ſo ſone as they haue done with vs, they remember vs no more.
            At the leaſt they haue done good to the Cleargie: They haue done ſomewhat for the Church, their chiefe pretence: the Clergie that pauned foorth themſelues and with ſo good a vvill ſould themſelues for them. Let vs ſee, they promiſed to diſperſe the Proteſtantes of Fraunce, and now beholde they haue more firmelie vnited them; Marke how they haue reunited and reconciled them with all other Nations, Engliſhmen, Frenchmen, Germains,
               
               Danes, Scots, Swethians and Switzers, ſee alſo how they haue made them to aſſociate themſelues with our Catholike Princes, and the chiefe Lordes of this Realme. The faction of the Religion groweth to vnion and ours euen manifeſtlie diſperſeth it ſelfe, howe much better had it beene to proceede by holie admonitions, by gentle conuerſation, and by good examples, meanes peraduentute too gentle for the vnpatient, but at the leaſt healthſome and aſſured, peraduenture leſſe agreeable to the pretended Phiſitions of our ſickneſſe, but at the leaſt profitable, but at the leaſt nothing dangerous to the diſeaſed.
            What had the Cleargie then gained? which of all the Biſhoppes, notwithſtāding whatſoeuer his charges, cā ſaie that he hath bene made whole againe? that he is anie thing amended by their armies? Naie to the contrarie, haue not the Lords of Ambrun, Lodeue, St. Pens, & others euen of late loſt their Biſhoprickes? How much of their temporalties muſt they ſell for

the recouerie of them by force? Will not all their affection and heate of pledging, ſelling and contributing bee firſt waſted like ſmoke.
            But wil you alſo ſee that it was but a pretence. The capteins of ye league doe ſkirmiſh together as it ſeemeth: For when there was anie ſpeeche of preaching in France, they wreſted foorth the kings Edict expreſlie to ſtoppe it, yet haue they permitted and conſented that the Gentlemen of the contrarie part, compounding for their houſes, ſhal haue free exerciſe of the Re

That which they permit to ſome, whie ſhould not the K. permit to all? Wherefore maie not the K. permit that to his Subiectes which the;

ſo voluntarilie doe ſuffer in ſtrangers? Wherefore ſhal that be a

               te of hereſie in the king, which in them is zeale of the Church, meritorious or veniall? Wherefore ſhoulde it bee damnable or mortall to their Superior?
            Theſe men haue in the end robbed and polluted the holie places: theſe men haue ſpoiled and ranſommed the preeſtes and monckes: theſe men vnder pretence of pietie haue committed 1000 impieties: theſe men vpon a merriment haue ſoaked out all our goods & drowned vs in all miſchiefes. Of ſuch and ſo great inconueniences what good can redound to vs? to the commons? to the nobilitie? to the cleargie particularlie or generallie? And who did euer anie miſchiefe, at the leaſt if he liſt to be obſtinate in it, but for hope of good. But maie I yet ſale more? what good haue they done to themſelues? For God hath in ſuch ſort curſed their actions that in the meane time while they weene to fee their confraries in the Townes vnder pretence of that authoritie that the
